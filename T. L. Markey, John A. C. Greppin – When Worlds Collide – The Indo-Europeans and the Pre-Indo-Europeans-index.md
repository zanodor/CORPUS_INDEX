WHEN CULTURES COLLIDE: THE INDO-EUROPEANS AND PRE-INDO-EUROPEANS
Welcome remarks
Thomas Markey (Bellagio, February 8-13,1988)
It is an exclusive pleasure for John A.C. Greppin and m yself to welcome so many friends, who also happen to be professional colleagues, to this week-long discussion— symposium seem s far too inflated a term for this event, while conference is even more inappropriate, though perhaps the convegno of our host country is, after all, most apt for an inviting setting in which we hope to accomplish much. In welcoming you, I wish to provide, however fragmentarily, both some foregrounding and some scaffolding. First, the conveners must thank the Rockefeller Foundation, whose villa hosts but some thirty such gatherings each year, and this particular gathering marks, we understand, a first : The first time linguists and archaeologists and anthropologists have met together here, and we would hope that this might provide a precedent for similar gatherings here and elsewhere in the future. But why, as we asked in our proposal for this gathering to the Rockefeller Foundation, this topic and why now? If the 19th century was, and I for one am thoroughly convinced that it was, concerned with origins, then the present century is an era that has increasingly looked for roots. A quest for origins and a search for roots are not the same and not to be confused. The quest for origins focuses on "whatness," while the search for roots focuses on "whoness." The issue o f origins is typically centered around natural ancestry, and Darwin provided the brand name for his age. In contrast, the quest for roots is essentially concerned with probing a cultural heritage, defining the fibres of an ethnicity, mapping ideational stratigraphies. The origins issue is characteristically a biological matter, while that of roots is generally intellectual in scope. The topic we are to address here in Bellagio is, indeed, fundamentally a question of roots. Having been assigned a biological past by the Victorians, we now want to discover mental cultivations within that past. The quest to know a Pre-Indo-European vs. an Indo



2 When Worlds Collide
European setting, the effort to question cultural confrontation, is a quest for roots, a search for a definition of one's intellectual self. It is the puzzle of roots, not o f origins, that has made our discussion topic so timely. Just how timely, how very popular, and how very open to commercialization the matter of roots has becom e may not be so obvious to us as scholars who naturally shun or who, perhaps out of professional or personal aesthetic necessity, must shun popular culture. "Roots" has becom e big business. A recent spate of films with the archaeologist as hero such as Raiders o f the Lost Ark, Romancing the Stone,and Indiana Jones, has made it abundantly clear just how enormous the size of that business can be. Another clear sign of that bigness is the staggering popularity of Jean M. Auels engaging on-going series, Earth's Children, which began with The Clan o f the Cave Bear. Ms. Auel has recently informed me that she is now hard at work on the fourth book in this projected six volume set. The popular acclaim of her writing is evidenced by the fact that ABC's 20/20 Program featured her and her work (April 17, 1986) and by the fact that such national attention might well have encouraged or at least have smoothed the way for the acceptance of Randall W hite as guest curator of the "Dark Caves, Bright Visions" exhibit, a "roots" display that was chronicled by no less an observer of the anthro-scene that John E. Pfeiffer in the Smithsonian Magazine (October, 1986). Ice Age Europe was never so "in," never so irresistible as now. It was also during the recent past that Alexander Marschack's extraordinary technical proficiency brought those bright visions to light, and the photographic record of cave art was intentionally packaged for mass consumption. The "roots" of writing have been brought to far wider public attention during the past decade by the notable efforts of D enise Schmandt-Besserat, e.g. her article in Science 211 (16 January 1981),pp. 283-5. The portrayal of a Great Goddess as earth-mother, as prime lifeforce, great diviner, and directive matriarch by Marija Gimbutas has engendered a feminist following that has provided its own intriguing quest for roots, its own interpretation of the artifactual record. Note, for example, Riane Eisler's recent The Chalice and the Blade. Our History, Our Future (New York: Harper and Row, 1987). In yes, Ms. Eisler sees Gimbutas' Old Europe as representing a so-called "gylanic" chalice-half Europe where reverence and celebration of life were symbolized by the Goddess' religion, a half that was pitted against the warlike patriarchy of the intrusive Indo-Europeans. Then, too, Donna Wilshire (Plainfield, New Jersey) now gives performances that are collages of song, dance, dramatized verse, and spoken history, contemporaneous ritual if you will that is based on recent scholarship about the Great Goddess. The archaeologist, in comparison with the linguist, has clearly played stagecenter in the "roots” business. Indeed, it seems as if the linguist has been rudely shoved aside, although an apparent exception seems to be Colin Renfrew’s Archaeology and Language (1987), about which we shall hear much more later at this gathering. Nevertheless, there has not been total media silence on the linguistic front, and the comparativist has not been excluded from all of this great fim. Nostratic theory has been given a North American revival Vitaly Shevoroshkin, and this catharsis was covered by John Noble Wilford this past fall in The New York Times (Science Times, Tuesday, Nov. 24,1987). So, the search for a unified proto-language, however distant in time and unrealistic in design, has also fired the "roots"



Markey 3
imagination. A lso within the linguistic realm is a work that I personally could not fail to mention, namely Derek Bickerton's Roots o f Language (1981), a study which, in its perhaps abortive attempt to see creole-like origins and a definite, well-articulated bioprogram for all lingual genesis, attracted vast amounts of mass-media attention for a number of years. Then, too, the origins people, the evolutionists, particularly the neodarwinians, have hardly been silent either, as evidenced by Newsweek’s (January 11, 1988) coverage of the pros and cons o f the mitochondrial mother, the original Ayla and Great Goddess, a common female ancestor for the species, quite possibly out of Africa. If you think that the "roots" phenomenon is some particularly American misadventure or aberration, then you are quite wrong and an imperceptive observer of your own time. Anglophones have hardly cornered the market. M ichel Foucault (b. 1926 - d. 1984) obviously sought "an archaeology of knowledge," merely another label for "roots," and his Les mots et les choses (1966) was not only a best-seller in France, but also, as, The Order o f Things, in the English-speaking world. There, Foucault devotes electrifying attention to the journey of historical linguistics from an alchemy o f verbiage to principled insights about the arsenal of minor morphemes we recognize as the basis of an Indo-European speech, if not language, community. Foucault's countryman, M ichel Serres, has run a parallel course in his search for the common roots of W estern science and yes. And far from France or German bookstores laden with best sellers discussing how a band of spater bekannt als IndoGerman (naturally), would conquer the world, we note that the Japanese, too, have embraced "roots": how and why were the original Jomon replaced by the Yayoi and with whom are these intruders to be linked, culturally and/or linguistically? As if in preparation to answer these and related questions, Japanese linguistics has recently shown a new awareness of an interest in Indo-European studies. A s precursors of the current Japanese, were the Yayoi designed from Austro-Tai stock, as Paul K. Benedict has compellingly asserted, or where they some lost ribe of Uralic wanderers as Roy Andrew M iller has steadfastly and simplistically maintained? So it is that "rootism" holds pervasive fascination for an era, a fascination that spans gulfs between disciplines and encircles the globe. It is possibly entirely natural that the question of "whatness" should precede the question of "whoness,” that is, that the issue of roots should trail in the wake of the subject origins. No matter, rootsism is now a nuclear concern, and a particular manifestation o f that ism is our topic of the Indo-Europeans and the pre-Indo-Europeans, whether a cataclysmic cultural onslaught or quiet hybridization, a massive invasion or a virtually imperceptible swarming effect, wholesale colonization or gradual, integrated accommodation, violent patriarchal herdsmen vs. passive matriarchal planters. The crux, it seem s to me, of our topic is the proper definition of process. We are here to consider the modalities of evidence in forging a definition, quite possibly a redefinition, from the linguistic, material, and social artifacts at our disposal. W e seek inferences about the margins of disruption. W e may advance parallels from a recent past to enlighten a remote relationship: What might subjugation of the agricultural Guanas by the fierce Paraguayan Mbayas have to say about the topic at hand? What valid social glosses are actually permitted by the artifactual evidence? What data can be used to



delineate a North European community prior to its Indo-Europeanization, or define a pre-Greek cultural sphere? What kinds of evidence do we have or can we use to show that knowledge partitioning distinguishes cultural and/or ethnic units? Was, for example, "megalithic science" transferable, or was this a form of knowledge that was socially tied to a particular cultural context? What ritualizations can be read into what kinds of knowledge evidenced by material and linguistic debris? The fanciful speculations that I often find characteristic of the past couple of decades are now being increasingly curtailed by advances in technology. Correspondingly, compelling and credible hypothesizing has becom e far less diffuse, but also perhaps far less thrilling for the popular mind. Such progress over previously highly imaginative assessment has been admirably exemplified by the detective work conducted by Don Robbins and Anne Ross on Lindow Man, the victim of an identifiable ritual act practised by a particular ethnic group. This is a far cry from the scrutiny first accorded Piltdown Man. Those V-inscribed Balkan figurines may be related to some sort o f fertility exercise, but to design a Great Goddess to accommodate them is mere wishful thinking. In welcoming you here, I hope to have shown just how timely and central the topic of this convegno is. The further interpretation of this topic may well become heated, for it is a well known complementarity o f scholarship that the more elusive the facts, the less objective and more personal their interpretation. This has certainly been the case in the heated debate over the demise o f the dinosaurs: Extra-terrestrial intervention vs. natural causes, that is, Luis Alvarez and his meteorite hypothesis vs. the paeleontologists, an outsider vs. the members of a discipline. What we hope to accomplish here, however, is an interdisciplinary conversation where there can be no outsiders.

ON THE PROBLEM OF AN ASIATIC ORIGINAL HOMELAND OF THE PROTO-INDO-EUROPEANS
Ex Oriente Lux.
Thomas V. Gamkrelidze (Tbilisi, Georgia, USSR)
A revision and reformulation of the basic structure of Proto-Indo-European and a formal-semantic reconstruction of the Common Indo-European vocabulary according to new phonological patterns in our recent publication* necessitate, as a consequence, to advance a new look at the areal and ethno-cultural problems pertaining to the distribution of the ancient Indo-European dialects, the original localization of the Proto-Indo-European speakers and their prehistoric migrations to the territories of their historical habitation. The picture of areal affinities drawn from the study of grammatical, phonological, and lexical isoglosses among dialects of a proto-language provides a way o f determining how dialectal differentiation of the proto-language proceeded and hence of establishing what contacts took place among speakers of the dialects. In other words, purely linguistic facts make it possible to establish extra-linguistic factors such as historical interactions among speakers of the linguistic systems. O f particular value and significance for linguistically based reconstruction of non-linguistic historical and social relations is formal semantic analysis of the dialect lexicons, since they can reflect all essential aspects of the historical existence of their speakers. The historical existence of the speakers includes the ecological environment (fauna, flora, geographical surroundings, climate) and human habitation and migration in the environment, as well as culture in the broadest sense (including both material and spiritual culture). Semantic reconstruction of relevant lexem es from the daughter languages gives us a general representation (although sometimes only a fragmentary one) of the speakers' historical existence. In such reconstructions, linguistic facts are a source of information on prehistoric culture and its historical evolution. T hus, comparative semantic analysis of words from separate daughter dialects of a proto-language and text fragments in separate daughter traditions, together with the method that may be called "linguistic paleontology of culture," makes it possible to



6 When Worlds Collide
reconstruct a semantic lexicon of the proto-language and a picture of the protoculture of the speakers of the proto-language or its dialect groups. This points to a possible original homeland and suggests rotites of migration by which speakers of the proto language or its dialects may have reached their historical territories. Semantic analysis o f the reconstructed vocabulary and its implications for the ecological environment and the material and spiritual culture of tribes speaking ancient Indo-European dialects places the center of diffusion of these dialects, and consequently the Proto-Indo-European homeland, somewhere in the broad area extending from the Balkans in the west to northern Mesopotamia and the Iranian plateau in the east, in the fifth to fourth millennia B.C. Numerous lexical items shared among Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Semitic, South Caucasian, and sometimes other ancient Near Eastern languages, further narrow down the potential homeland to a particular area in southwest Asia. This posited homeland necessitates a complete revision of the received view of the Proto-Indo-European speakers' migrations to their historical locations on the Eurasian continent. The main question associated with the problem of the actual existence of a common Indo-European proto-language in space and time is the question of chronology and the territory occupied by the Proto-Indo-European language, the break up of which led to the formation of related historical dialects. The lower chronological limit for establishing the period of existence of a proto-language is deduced first of all on the basis of the dating of written evidence from the various historical languages deriving from it. In the case of Proto-Indo-European, this lower chronological limit post quern non is the turn of the third to the second millennium B.C., when we find the earliest evidence of H ittite and other Anatolian languages. It may be concluded from Anatolian onomastics of the Cappadocian tablets dating from the turn of the third to the second millennium B.C. that the various Anatolian languages underwent an extremely long period of development and formation after they had become distinct from one another; this period postdates the time when the Anatolian family had become differentiated from Proto-Indo-European. To the same direction points a recent revelation made by Professor Henning who identifies the Gutians or Kutians and Tukres of the ancient Near East that occur in the cuneiform inscriptions of the end of the 3rd millennium B.C. with historical KuchiTocharians, this being the earliest appearance of Indo-Europeans in history (cf. W. Henning, the first Indo-Europeans in history, "Society and History." Essays in Honour o f Karl August Wittfogel, ed. by A.L. Ulmen, The Hague, Paris, N.Y. 1978:216-229). This means that the differentiation of the Anatolian and Tocharian family of languages from the Indo-European proto-language, and thus the beginning of the break-up of the proto-language, must be dated to a period not later than the fourth millennium B.C., and possibly much earlier. Evidence about the differentiation of other dialectal communities from the proto-language also concurs with the dating of the Proto-Indo-European language deduced from the Anatolian and Tocharian languages. The Indo-European linguistic community that remained after the emergence from the proto-language of a common Anatolian and a corresponding Tocharian linguistic community, which are combined into a single group by the scheme of dialect classification, began the same time to break down into dialect groups, which subsequently produced the respective historical



Gamkrelidze 7
dialects. In particular, one should date the emergence of the Greek-Armenian-Aryan dialect community, later differentiated into the Indo-Iranian dialect group and the Greek and Proto-Armenian dialects to about the same time. The original area inhabited by the speakers of Proto-Indo-European may be regarded as that geographic region which, in this period, corresponded in its ecological, geographic, and cultural-historical features to the picture of the habitat which emerges on the basis o f a linguistic reconstruction, and a semantic analysis, of the common vocabulary o f the proto-language. The first point which may be stated with sufficient assurance with regard to the homeland o f the Proto-Indo-European language is that it was a region with a mountainous landscape. This is indicated primarily by the numerous Indo-European words designating 'high mountains' and 'heights.' This picture of the "original" ProtoIndo-European landscape naturally rules out those flat regions of Europe where there are no large mountain ranges, that is, the northern part of central Eurasia and the whole o f eastern Europe, including the region north o f the Black Sea. Data about Indo-European names for trees and plants which agree with the characteristics o f a mountain landscape for the original Indo-European homeland, situate it in the comparatively more southern regions of the Mediterranean area in the broad sense, which includes the Balkans and the northern part of the Near East (Asia Minor, the mountain regions o f Upper Mesopotamia, and adjoining areas). This relatively southern character of the ecological environments of the original Indo-European homeland, proposed on the basis of data on the geographic landscape and plant life, is supported by an analysis of the Proto-Indo-European names for animals. The conclusion that the original homeland could not have been in central and eastern (excepting southeastern) Europe as deduced on the basis of evidence about the landscape and ecological habitat concurs with cultural and historical data on domestic animals and cultivated plants with which the ancient Indo-Europeans must have been acquainted. The terminology of agriculture is persuasive evidence supporting the possible location of the Indo-European group in regions with highly developed (in the fourth millennium B.C. and earlier) agriculture, that is, in the southern territories extending from the Balkans to Iran. The presence of a developed terminology for agriculture and viticulture rules out the more northern regions of Europe. An especially valuable indicator for establishing the original place where the ancient Indo-Europeans lived and locating the original Indo-European homeland is Indo-European terminology for transportation - the names of wheeled vehicles. The names of metal ('bronze'), necessary for making wheeled vehicles from the hardwoods of the mountain forests, and draught power ('horse') - which one must postulate for the period of the Proto-Indo-European language, that is, in the fourth millennium B.C. This entire complex of data again restricts the territory of the original distribution of the Indo-European language to the region from the Balkans to the Near East and the Transcaucasus, up to the Iranian plateau and southern Turkmenia. According to archaeological data, the manufacture o f wheeled vehicles dates from around the fourth millennium B.C. The original area of their distribution is accepted to be the area from the Transcaucasus to Upper Mesopotamia. W heeled vehicles spread from the place of their inception in the Near East to the Volga-Ural region, the region north of the Black



8 When Worlds Collide
Sea, the Balkans, and Central Europe. This time also marks the beginning of the Bronze A ge in the Near East. The very same territory is one of the possible regions where the horse was domesticated or, in any case, to which the domesticated horse and its use as a draught animal had spread. The extensive Proto-Indo-European terminology for transport vehicles, harnesses, and their parts, as well as 'horse' and 'bronze' are grounds for locating the original Indo-European homeland in the fourth millennium B.C. within the area indicated, from the Balkans (including the Near East and the Transcaucasus) as far as southern Turkmenia. A reconstructed Proto-Indo-European lexicon for different semantic groups expressing fauna, flora, economy, and material culture allows us to outline the approximate geographical area within which the original Indo-European homeland might have been situated and from which the migration of the Indo-European tribes, leading to their distribution throughout the vast territory of Eurasia in historical times, must have begun. Evidence of another order, such as elem ents of spiritual culture reconstructed on the basis of linguistic data, as well as lexical borrowings and evidence of interaction of the Indo-European language with other languages, enables us to narrow this vast region of the possible original homeland of the Indo-Europeans even further, and to limit it to a more compact area. The Proto-Indo-European linguistic area should be located in that part of the region outlined above where interaction and contact between the Proto-Indo-European language and the Semitic and South Caucasian languages were possible, since these languages contain a whole stratum of lexical elem ents borrowed from one language to the other, and many complex structural features suggesting interaction between them over a long period of time. The interaction of Proto-Indo-European with Proto-Semitic and ProtoKartvelian (Caucasian) as well as certain ancient Near Eastern languages suggests a specific area in southwest Asia as the original Indo-European homeland where these contacts could have come about; this, of course, rules out the Balkans as a possible territory for the original distribution of Proto-Indo-Emropean. Territorial contacts between Proto-Indo-European and the Semitic and Kartvelian languages revealed in material on lexical borrowings fit in well with the time and space distribution of the Semitic and Kartvelian proto-language systems. The existence of Proto-Semitic must be dated to a period not later than the fourth millennium B.C., since by the middle of the third millennium B.C. the Semitic dialects (Akkadian, Eblaite) are already apparent and completely differentiated and developed. The Proto-Semitic area in the Near East must have been a specific region, where contacts of the Semitic languages with both the Indo-European proto-language system and the southern Caucasian system (Kartvelian) could have taken place. A semantic analysis of the Proto-Indo-European lexicon and text fragments enables us to reconstruct the culture and social relations of the community which spoke Proto-Indo-European. The entire nature of Proto-Indo-European culture and social relations indicates that this culture was close to the ancient Eastern civilizations. This is an additional argument in favor of the thesis that the Proto-Indo-European homeland was in southern Asia, where the culture of the Proto-Indo-European community formed and developed in contact and in close interaction with the cultural areas of the peoples of the ancient Near East.



Gamkrelidze 9
The Proto-Indo-European lexicon and reconstructed fragments of texts enable us to establish a relatively high level of material culture. Various manifestations of a rather high level of spiritual activity can be reconstructed, in particular the metric forms and poetic language, as well as the ritual represented in the mythology and broad priestly terminology. Not only is Proto-Indo-European mythology similar in type to the ancient Eastern mythological traditions, but its mythological motifs and imagery also have analogues in ancient Eastern mythologies, whose influence must have helped to shape the Proto-Indo-European mythological tradition. The presence of typological parallels and coincidences compel one to draw the conclusion that close interrelationships existed between the different mythological traditions within a common cultural area. In the fourth and fifth millennia B.C., in which we have hypothetically dated the existence of the Indo-European proto-language and, accordingly, of Proto-IndoEuropean society, before the beginning of the major migrations, this entire set of cultural and socio-econom ic features was typologically characteristic of the early civilizations of the ancient Near East. Proto-Indo-European culture belongs typologically to the family of archaic Near Eastern civilizations. The determination of the area of the original distribution of the Proto-IndoEuropean language, and, correspondingly, the tribes who spoke it, raises the question as to which archaeological culture in southwest Asia might be identified with the ProtoIndo-European culture. It should be noted at the outset that the original area of distribution indicated for the Proto-Indo-European language in the fourth - fifth millennia B.C. does not have an archaeological culture which might be identified in any explicit way with Proto-IndoEuropean. One can only speak of possible connections, direct or indirect, between Near Eastern Archaeological cultures of that period and the Indo-European. These ties between ancient archaeological cultures and reconstructed attributes of Proto-IndoEuropean spiritual and material culture might serve as indirect evidence of the possible identity between these cultures. It seems to us that within the outlined areas in southwest Asia corresponding to the area of original distribution of the Proto-IndoEuropean language in the fifth to fourth millennia B.C. and earlier, a number of archaeological cultures are found, which in some of their features are very similar to the Proto-Indo-European culture reconstructed on the basis on linguistic material. It is very revealing that these conclusions about the original homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans in southwest Asia reached mainly on linguistic grounds, on the basis of a semantic analysis of the proto-lexemes by the method of "linguistic paleontology of culture," have been fully corroborated and enhanced by solid archaeological evidence furnished by Professor Colin Renfrew in his recent book on Archaeology and Language. The Puzzle o f Indo-European Origins, London, 1987. Professor Renfrew argues that the Proto-Indo-Europeans should be located in ancient Anatolia at an early date (around the VII millennium B.C.) with their later westward and eastward expansions as a result of the population growth caused by the development of farming. That the Proto-Indo-Europeans were good farmers can be demonstrated on the evidence of their reconstructed language and vocabulary, and Colin Renfrew suggests that it was the Indo-Europeans who brought farming culture to Europe.



10 When Worlds Collide
However, I cannot share Colin Renfrew's skepticism concerning the possibility of a cultural and material reconstruction mainly on linguistic and lexical evidence, if the linguistic analysis is properly carried out and all extralinguistic factors taken duely into account. The coincidence of our views concerning the original homeland of the IndoEuropeans and the Indo-European origins is a clear demonstration of the validity of both linguistic and archaeological approaches to the problem of the original habitat of the peoples with richly documented linguistic evidence. The migrations of the speakers of the different dialects into new habitats may have taken place both in the form of a gradual penetration of the new ethnic elem ent in comparatively small groups into the local population, as well as by the conquest of new areas and subjugation of the local population. The dialects brought by the migrating tribes to their new habitats may either have become absorbed by the languages of the local populations, leaving a few traces of their structure and vocabulary as a superstratum in the surviving, old languages of the autochtonous population; or they may have supplanted the ancient local languages of the autochtonous population and become the language of the land. In the latter case, the vestiges of local dialects of the autochtonous population appear as a substratum, leaving traces, sometimes very considerable, throughout the entire structure and lexicon of the new dialects brought by the tribes who had migrated to the new habitat. The substrata influences can bring about considerable transformations in the original structure and phonetic composition of the dialects brought into the new regions, causing them to diverge from their original structure. In similar instances, where a new language spreads into areas that had been occupied by migrating tribes, the old local population with which the newly arrived tribes have assimilated will, practically speaking, adopt this new language. Another instance of the diffusion of a new language into areas to which its speakers have migrated would be the expulsion of the local population from its ancient habitat and the settling of the vacated lands by the speakers of the new languages. Each of these types of interaction between languages is correlated with analogous types of culture and anthropological contact between the speakers of these dialects and, in particular, with the mixing or supplanting of certain anthropological types. Thus, for example, in cases where languages spread into new territories and the old local population is expelled we see a simple penetration of the new cultural and anthropological type into these regions from the regions originally inhabited by the speakers of these languages, while when the newly arrived population is assimilated by the previous local inhabitants this process will be less explicitly reflected in cultural and anthropological innovations. The historical distribution and routes of migration of the principal ancient Indo-European ethnic groups who first appear in ancient written records - the HittiteLuwians, Indo-Iranians, and Greeks (the Mycenaean Greeks and the Achaeans of H ittite sources) - can be explained more easily if one assumes that the territory of the original Indo-European homeland coincided with a region contained within eastern Anatolia, the southern Caucasus, and northern Mesopotamia in the fourth to fifth millennia B.C.

The most ancient linguistic community to becom e differentiated from the Proto-Indo-European language and to continue an independent existence in isolation from the latter must be considered the Anatolian dialectal group and Tocharian, as is evident from the pattern of dialectal division of the original Proto-Indo-European language. The displacement of the Proto-Anatolian group relative to the original territory of the Proto-Indo-European language was comparatively minor. This also accounts for the exceptionally archaic features of the Anatolian languages. In the historical period, Anatolian languages (Cuneiform H ittite, Luwian, and Palaic) were already widely spread in A sia Minor in the central regions of Anatolia. This distribution of Anatolian dialects in the central regions of Anatolia was apparently the result of the movement of speakers of Anatolian dialects from east to west. A t the beginning of the historical period, the movement o f the H ittites from east to west (and later from north to south) may be assumed on the basis of H ittite historical sources. After the differentiation of the Proto-Anatolian and Tocharian dialectal groups from the Proto-Indo-European language, the Greek-Armenian-Aryan dialectal group must have emerged from the Proto-Indo-European language system, and then later have broken up into the Greek, Proto-Armenian, and Indo-Iranian dialects. The extensive migrations of tribes which affected this dialectical community evidently began after it had broken up into separate dialects and Greek, Armenian, and Indo-Iranian had emerged as discrete Indo-European dialects. The break-up of this linguistic community evidently began with the formation of an Aryan dialectal area within the Proto-Indo-European language system while Armenian-Greek dialectal unity still persisted. After the separation of Indo-Iranian from the Greek-Armenian-Aryan dialectal area, the Greek-Armenian dialect remained for a time in its old territory, and may have come in contact there with other Indo-European dialects, in particular with Tocharian and Ancient European. It may have been during this same period, when the Greek-Armenian community existed as an independent entity, that the structural and lexical isoglosses common to Greek and Armenian emerged. The hypothesis that the original homeland of the Indo-European language was in southwest Asia naturally defines the direction of migration of the speakers of Greek dialects across Asia Minor to their historical habitats in the Peloponnesus and the islands o f the Aegean Sea. If it is assumed that the migration of the speakers of the Greek dialects was across Asia Minor, traces of these early migrations might be found in early data on the Greeks in Miletus and Ahhijawa. Evidence of this is also provided by connections discovered between archaeological cultures in western Asia Minor, on the one hand, and the Peloponnesus and the Aegean Island, on the other. The hypothesis that the Greeks came to mainland Greece from the east across A sia Minor also puts the question of the Greek "colonies" in Asia Minor, and especially the problem of Miletus, in a new light. In the light of the eastern hypothesis, these "colonies" may be regarded as very early Greek settlements established along the path of migration of the Greek tribes to their historical habitat on the Aegean Island and the mainland Greece. If we assume a southwest Asian homeland for the Indo-Europeans, there was presumably a comparatively minor displacement of Proto-Armenian within the area of



12 When Worlds Collide
A sia Minor, where it might have come in contact with the Anatolian languages. Subsequently, Proto-Armenian spread into historical Armenia, into the Armenian uplands, and became superimposed on a Hurrian-Urartian substratum. The eastern borderlands of the Proto-Indo-European territory - the northern part of the Iranian plateau must have been a historical territory of the Indo-Iranian language. According to archaeological data, the appearance of Indo-Iranian tribes in the north of Iran must date from the first half of the third millennium B.C. The gray pottery which appears in this period in northern Iran is comparable to the gray Minyan pottery from western Anatolia. The first waves of Aryans must have passed from here through Afghanistan and then further eastward into northwestern India. It must be assumed that various Aryan dialects, one of which has been documented in Mitannian Aryan in the middle of the second millennium B.C., were spread out south of the Caucasus in the original territory of the Indo-European tribes as early as the end of the fourth and in the third millennium B.C. The speakers of these dialects, who had chariots and horses, could make the long migrations both to the east, which brought some of them to Afghanistan and historical India, and to the west (the Mitannian Aryans), north, and south. The northern migrations may also have brought some Aryan tribes across the Transcaucasus to the northern Caucasus. The archaic hymns of the Rigveda provide evidence of the differentiation of a special dialect group which later constituted the beginnings of the Iranian languages, alongside other groups within the Indo-Iranian linguistic community. These hymns contain several Iranian hydronyms and toponyms of southeastern Iran and Afghanistan and proper names which already have specifically Iranian phonetic characteristics. The Iranian-speaking tribes, especially the eastern Iranians, made intensive migrations across Central Asia and the norther Caspian steppes. The earliest evidence of migrations of Iranian-speaking tribes across Central Asia toward the north and west may be seen in the numerous loanwords in the Finno-Ugric languages. These FinnoUgric words should be interpreted as early Iranian, and not as Aryan or even less as Old Indie loans. A phonetic analysis of these Finno-Urgic forms links them to the linguistic features characteristic of the early Iranian dialect directly after it became differentiated from the Aryan dialectal group. The early Iranian borrowings in Finno-Urgic indicate that the Iranian-speaking tribes became differentiated from Proto-Indo-Iranian at a quite early period, evidently as early as the end of the third millennium B.C., and that some of these tribes moved in a northwesterly direction along a path which the Iranian-speaking tribes were later to travel a number of times, leaving their traces in the late Iranian loan words in the Finno-Ugric languages (cf. Middle Iranian and Late Iranian loan words). These early migrations of the Iranian-speaking tribes to the north and then to the northwest followed their migrations from an original region of habitation in Central Asia, whence they must have spread further to the north and northwest, and also perhaps to the south toward Afghanistan. The dialects of tribes speaking Tocharian became differentiated rather early from Proto-Indo-European and continued to exist along with other dialects of the IndoEuropean linguistic community in the original territory of the Indo-European tribes in southwest Asia (cf. the later Kutians and Tukres). It was in this period that the isoglosses of Tocharian may have emerged, linking it to the dialect areas comprising



Gamkrelidze 13
Anatolian, Italic, and Celtic. However, even before Italic and Celtic became differentiated from the proto-language, the Tocharian dialect area must have become differentiated from the Anatolian as a result of the migrations of the speakers of the Tocharian dialects from their original habitations toward the east in the direction of Central Asia. The Tocharian dialects were evidently the first and earliest waves of migrations (preceding even the Indo-Iranian migrations) toward the east from the original homeland o f the ProtoJndo-European language in southwest Asia. The early presence of speakers of the Tocharian dialects in the East, in the region of Central Asia, on their way to eastern Turkestan, is attested by several Tocharian loanwords in the Finno-Urgic languages. This route is assumed to have been traversed also by the speakers of the Ancient European dialects - Celto-Italic, Germanic, and Balto-Slavic. A ll these languages have a number of lexical isoglosses in common with Tocharian which are very difficult to explain without assuming contacts, probably in process of joint migrations of the speakers of these languages together with the speakers of the Tocharian languages. The speakers of the Tocharian dialects from Central Asia later moved further to the east toward eastern Turkestan and are found there when these languages begin to be recorded. The remaining "Ancient European" dialects moved across Central Asia and the Volga region toward the west into historical Europe. This eastern route of migrations of the "Ancient European" dialects also accounts for certain lexical ties between the western group of Indo-European languages and the Altaic group, from which they borrowed some specific terms such as, e.g., *mork'n' - 'horse.1 Evidence of the migration of speakers of the Ancient European dialects across Central Asia toward the west is provided, evidently, by the presence of Indo-European lexical borrowings in Finno-Ugric, the source of which may be considered to be the "Ancient European" dialects. The "Ancient European" dialects must have been a language group which was still poorly differentiated into individual dialects during the period of migration of their speakers and in the process of their movement westward from Central Asia. This group was characterized by a number of lexical innovations in comparison to other Indo-European dialects which had already becom e differentiated by this time. Such innovations of "Ancient European" dialects have to do basically with lexical semantics. They are manifested in the use of ancient words in new meanings specific to this dialect group, and in the appearance of certain new words not represented in the other Indo-European dialects. The movement of the "Ancient European" dialects across Central Asia with a subsequent orientation toward western Eurasia evidently took place in the form of repeated waves of migrations from the east to western Eurasia, where these tribes later settled and populated som e common territory. The newly arrived tribes united with the tribes already settled on this territory and thus formed a common interim area for the Indo-European tribes who m igrated.from the east and later populated the more westerly regions of Europe. This common interim area became a region for contacts and the reassociation of Indo-European dialects which had earlier becom e partly separated from one another. This interaction may be seen as an example of the emergence o f a second language union among originally related dialects. The spread of dialects from this second common area (in certain sense, the second interim homeland of tribes who



14 When Worlds Collide
spoke the various dialects) to a new territory in Central and W estern Europe laid the basis for the gradual emergence of discrete languages (Italic, Celtic, Germanic, BaltoSlavic). Consequently, the area north of the Black Sea region and the Volga steppes may be considered the basic common (although secondary) homeland for the "Ancient European" languages. The theory of Marija Gimbutas which situates the original home of the Indo-Europeans in this region thus takes on new import as a hypothesis concerning the homeland of the western group of Indo-European languages. This interim area of joint habitation for tribes who spoke ancient Indo-European dialects may have served as a region through which various waves of migrations of IndoEuropeans passed. It was here that the secondary isoglosses were formed and superimposed on the old ones, uniting these dialects with other Indo-European languages whose speakers had migrated from their original habitations in other directions. These views on the Proto-Indo-European habitat in southwest Asia and the Indo-European migrations have been put forth by us as early as 1972* and later elaborated upon in diverse publications.** Our work in this direction is summed up in the aforementioned joint monograph of 1984 which contains also a semantic vocabulary of the reconstructed Common-Indo-European lexemes. This semantic vocabulary served as a substantive basis for inquiry into the problems of the original homeland, areal contacts, and possible prehistoric migrations of the Proto-Indo-European speaking tribes.

ARCHAEOLOGY AND LINGUISTICS: SOME
PRELIMINARY ISSUES
Colin Renfrew
Many historical linguists will feel it inappropriate - an impertinence even - that som eone from another discipline, someone not well versed in the field of linguistics, should challenge some of the central tenets widely held by various specialists in the field o f what has come to be known as Indo-European studies. It was o n e . of the outstanding inter-disciplinary features of the Bellagio Conference that this view was certainly not expressed. Indeed, while it may privately have been felt by a few of those present, an entirely different spirit prevailed, one in which basic assumptions could be re-appraised. Certainly I came to see more clearly some of the difficulties in the linguistic field for the alternative thesis which I have been propounding. In this short resume, however, it will be more appropriate to develop, concisely, some of the points set out in Archaeology and Language . Many of them were taken up in discussion and will no doubt be examined again in the other papers. There are several general points which merit, I believe, thorough re examination. In a sense these are more important, certainly of wider validity, than the specific thesis which I offer on the Indo-European problem: namely the correlation of the distribution of an early Proto-Indo-European language with a "wave of advance" spread of a farming economy from Anatolia. These points are (a) the autonomy of the linguistic data, (b) the need for an accompanying historical reality, (c) the problem of chronology in the linguistic field, (d) the appropriate use of archaeology to aid in the reconstruction of the needed historical reality, (e) the risk that the products of research in the field of mythology may come into conflict with that "historical reality," and the appropriate resolution of this conflict.



16 When W orlds C ollide
A. The autonomy of the linguistic approach
A central problem in the field o f historical linguistics is the autonomy, the independence of the linguistic data: they prove difficult to relate to other data that are not themselves purely linguistic. Relations between languages can be asserted and defined, and language groups may be established through studies of phonology and grammar as well as vocabulary. In order, however, to set these observations into a historico-linguistic framework, it is necessary to make various assumptions. Indeed a necessary preliminary is to employ som e model for linguistic change. One model has dominated this field for more than a century, and especially since the Neo-Grammarian formulation of Brugmann. This model has the great merit of establishing a dear methodology for linguistic reconstruction. By assuming that a significant change is mainly of one kind - through divergence from a shared common ancestor - a clear program is established for the historical linguist of recreating that ancestral tongue through the 'comparative method.' In doing so, other processes of change are not denied: loan words can be accommodated within the model and phenomena of convergence, for instance through the emergence of chance similarities, and the development of others through contact, are permissible. But seen from the standpoint of neo-grammarian historical linguistics, these are in effect secondary phenomena. This situation, it might be argued, sets the pattern for all subsequent discussion. Indeed I am very much aware that it has set the pattern for my own. It would have been a more radical approach on my part, and perhaps a more constructive one, to break out of the mold of this kind of historical linguistics which seems inseparable from the primacy of a Stammbaum model. In my book I referred briefly to the proposal by Trubetzkoy of an alternative approach where convergence rather than divergence would be the dominant process and where the Stammbaum model would be relegated to a secondary position. Interestingly enough this point has been among those most brusquely dismissed by the critics of my book. As one of these (P. B aldr) has put it:
"This paper by the otherwise redoubtable Trubetzkoy was a footnote to a distinguished career as a theoretical phonologist and general linguist, and it cannot be taken to represent anything but his own thoughts on the matter. What Renfrew fails to recognize is that linguistic convergence theories are not scientifically provable because they cannot be put to the test of the comparative method. That is not to say that convergence doesn't happen but to point out that the methodologies by which such theories are addressed are quite different."
This comment underlines how far the comparative method (which seems inseparable from a family tree model for linguistic change) has come to dominate thought, to the extent that other approaches are 'not scientifically provable' because they are incompatible with it. O f course it is not my intention to belittle the work that



has indeed been undertaken using other models for change, not least the wave model. It is precisely here that important developments may come. But despite such work I am not aware of any coherent historical scenario in the field of Indo-European linguistic studies which offers in the last analysis an alternative to the Stammbaum model. That model carries with it the inescapable accompaniment o f an Ursprache and an Urheimat. I count it among the greatest limitations of my own position that I have escaped neither. For although the socio-cultural models for change which I have set out (see below) are, I hope, somewhat more coherent than the rather naive migration model which they seek to replace, they do not escape reliance upon this dominant model of historical linguistics whereby the primary process of linguistic change is divergence of family tree type. O f course it is precisely the limitations o f a non-linguist which restrict me to the use of the dominant existing model. But this should not blind one to the opportunities which remain for an em anation much closer in spirit to that of Trubetzkoy. It is, for instance, well established that most o f the areas of Europe and A sia were inhabited already in Upper Palaeolithic times. A coherent explanation in terms o f convergence might seek to reflect the underlying cultural unities in the Upper Palaeolithic occupation over much of this area in linguistic terms also. Successive phases of interaction over thousands of years would account for many of the linguistic features observed. Such a view would not need to rule out episodes of migration, nor the working o f divergence processes alongside the primary explanatory elem ents of community o f origin in the Upper Palaeolithic (note, again, the hint of Urvolk and Ursprache contained there), and of convergence processes over several millennia. (The chronological issues raised are touched on in (c) below). But for an archaeologist to attempt such a task would be even more foolhardy than my own modest attempt, which ultimately succumbs to the dominant position of the comparative method and its Stammbaum Theorie implications. Models of linguistic change must be developed by linguists - that is also implied by the term "autonomy." But until such models escape the stigma of the view that "linguistic convergence theories" are not scientifically (or epistemologically) different we shall have to continue to work within a divergence framework and thus maintain the quest for both Ursprache and Urheimat.
B. The need for an accompanying historical reality
It is helpful, I believe, to see that the linguistic realm just mentioned, and the concrete historical reality of real persons living in determined places at different times, are different worlds. Both are constructs, reached by processes of inference from data observed in the present. Naturally the archaeologist will see the methods of archaeology as the most appropriate for reaching the "historical reality" in question. That point is considered further in (D ) below. But we should not forget that the methods of archaeological reconstruction were not applied in this field until about the time of Kossinna (in 1902). Moreover, it is not inaccurate to say that in the field of Indo-European studies all the historical models hitherto employed have been of a rather simplistic migrationist nature.
Renfrew



The more general point is that, whether or not we are relying heavily upon the methods of archaeology, we are entitled to ask that whatever reconstruction is offered be expressed in coherent historical terms - we are entitled to ask where and when. Certainly previous archaeological explanations, such as those of Childe and Gimbutas, have been very positive in these respects. But others have been much more vague, and sometimes this vagueness has, at least superficially, added to the plausibility of their explanations. This criticism could no doubt be levelled at a number of historical linguists. But it is particularly o f the work of the late Georges Dumezil and his followers that I am thinking. H is vast edifice of mythological reconstruction is based upon the assertion of a shared common origin for the greater part of the mythology (and social structure) for most Indo-European-speaking peoples. But nowhere does he come out and say where and when this shared experience is to be situated. If he had in fact done so, the implausibility of any of the resulting scenarios which he might have offered would have done damage to his credibility. Instead he appears to have operated in a different world again, separate from a concrete notion of where and when, whose properties are determined solely by the myths and by the social structures which he is considering. It is a dream world standing apart from the constraints and the minutiae of the here and the now (or the there and the then), which has with it some of the tim elessness of the Arthurian legend, or o f "the fable" in the perspective of the poet Edwin Muir. But while such a perception is illuminating in the work of a poet, to ask from a scholar for more concrete particulars within what purports to be a scholarly discipline is not mere pedantry. It is no reproach to the historical linguist that the relations and conclusions established by his or her discipline are primarily linguistic: each discipline operates first within its own autonomous field. But the next stage must be to relate this by some explicit means to a more concrete historical reality. Chronology is a central issue.
C. The problem of chronology in the linguistic field
Historical linguistics is about linguistic relationships. In favorable cases it may be possible to arrange these within some temporal sequence. But it should be noted that in most cases such a conclusion can only be reached by making prior assumptions (such as the almost ubiquitous acceptance of the comparative method and the accompanying Stammbaum m odel). There seems nothing, however, in the patterns of linguistic change which would allow the establishment of any kind of absolute chronology. The contrary, of course, was asserted with dramatic effect by Morris Swadesh, whose exposition of glottochronology had so great an impact in the 1960s. But the notion that all formerly homogeneous languages diverge, once separation has occurred, at a determined and absolute rate has since been almost universally criticized. And one can see why. There is absolutely no prior expectation that such a uniformity should exist. It does not achieve authority by being deduced from some larger explanatory framework, as do many of the laws of physics. But if it is merely an empirical generalization it has two limitations. First, it has not been demonstrated on the basis of a large number of well-argued cases. And secondly, if it is merely a generalization from
18 When Worlds Collide



Renfrew 19
a few cases, without an accompanying framework of reasoning, there is no special reason to expect it to apply in other cases also. These epistomological criticisms have always seem ed to me so self-evident that demonstration by counter-example of the fallaciousness o f the Swadesh "law" is almost superfluous. Why on earth would languages diverge at so uniform a rate? These criticisms have been widely expressed, and so far no critic of my own book has rallied to the defense o f glottochronology. Indeed som e have argued that in criticizing it I have been in effect flogging a dead horse, and could better have omitted reference to so discredited a Geld. Yet there is a curious phenomenon here which merits very close attention. For in som e cases it is those same austere critics of glottochronology who make objection to the hypothesis which I have formulated precisely upon chronological grounds. I think that this apparent contradiction would repay further examination. My own hypothesis proposes the existence of a Proto-Indo-European language in central and eastern Anatolia as early as 7,000 BC, and the transmission o f a form of this language to Greece by 6,500 BC through the slow spread of a farming economy carried by individuals, none of which needs to have travelled more than 20 or 30 kilometers on land (although some did indeed have to make the sea crossing o f the Aegean). The comparable movements of successive generations of the growing population of farmers would have carried a farming economy, and a form of ProtoIndo-European language to the shores of Britain by about 4,000 BC. This hypothesis, as noted above, while avoiding mass migrations and long-distance movements, does not avoid the basic Stammbaum formulation of the comparative method. And it puts an early date upon the divergences involved. The Proto-Celtic language would be separate from Proto-Greek or Proto-Anatolian by 4,000 BC, and so forth. Of course, when neighboring territories are in question, there need not be so early a date of divergence, and the interaction o f the Proto-Greek with the Proto-Anatolian languages could be almost indeGnitely prolonged. But when we are speaking of more remote areas and language-speakers (e.g. Celts and Tocharians) the implications are clear. Now one very interesting aspect o f the reactions to this view is that many linguists have commented that these proposed dates of separation are "too early." But how, in the light o f the foregoing discussion, and of their own almost universal condemnation of glottochronology, do they know this, or judge this? There are, o f course, some who base their conclusions upon the findings of linguistic palaeontology, when reliance upon various key words selected from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European proto-lexicon, such as those for 'wheel' or 'horse' can indeed, when related to the archaeological data, offer a date in absolute years. But the date comes from the archaeology not from the linguistics. Yet many linguists today look with considerable caution (and very properly so) upon the small congeries of terms which forms the nub of the paleontological argument3. There appear to be unstated assumptions, made by many linguists, about unspeciGed regularities in the rates of innovation and change among dialects or languages formerly homogeneous but subsequently isolated one from another. It may indeed be plausible that language A , which separated early (at time t-j)



20 When Worlds Collide



Renfrew 21
should differ more from language C than does language B. Such a prediction is based on notions of relative similarity and difference rather than of an absolute rate of change which mars glottochronology. But in fact the relative chronology itself depends on assumptions of constant rate as much as would an absolute one. For if language A has evolved slowly between t^ and tg and language C likewise between t2 and Ц while language В has undergone rapid change between t^ and t^, the converse could be true, and C could be more closely similar to A than it is to B. If we abandon assumptions about approximately constant rates of language change, then such assertions, even relative ones, are not necessarily valid. O f course it may appear entirely reasonable to suggest that languages which are very close in their vocabularies have only recently becom e isolated one from another. But given the widespread rejection of glottochronology per se, to accept this without examining the underlying assumptions appears to lack rigor.
D. The appropriate use of archaeology
In my book I argue that the earlier equation:
culture = people (ethnos) = language
should be abandoned. The archaeological 'culture' is an artificial construct, and 'ethnicity' is not lightly to be assumed. Instead I argue that we can seek to investigate the relationship between:
change in social and language material culture demographic change change
It is desirable to be explicit about the kinds of change envisaged. More specifically I argue that language replacement within a given area can be approached using a number of models. A ll homeland models for a given group of languages (and therefore all Stammbaum models for such groups) assume language replacement (unless the territories in question were not populated at all prior to the dispersal of the Proto language). The principal models for social/demographic change which are offered as likely to accompany language displacement are:
(i) subsistence/demography model
(ii) elite dominance
(iii) system collapse.
But others could be offered, including the development of a pidgin language as a tribe language over a wide tract of country, and its subsequent foundation for the emergence of a number of related creole languages .



22 When Worlds Collide
It is my argument that the use of this kind of reasoning is the only way by which the archaeologist may reach toward the kind of historical reality which could also be intelligible in linguistic terms. Instead, I would go so far as to say that without some such reasoning of this kind, some dear awareness of the kind of archaeological evidence which we may be seeking, there can be no hope of arriving at a coherent view of IndoEuropean origins. In my book I apply one specific version of the subsistence/demography model, namely the Wave of Advance model proposed by A. Ammerman and L. Cavalli-Sforza. Some commentators have observed that the use of a single model o f this kind is an over-simplification. But there need be no disagreement on that point: it is the function of a model to simplify and, in a sense, to oversimplify. What I have tried to do is to explain in this way the very widespread distribution in Europe of the Indo-European languages. To explain in detail all the particularities of the linguistic map would require a series of subsidiary explanations depending, it may well be, upon other models also. That rejoinder is not, of course, a reply to those archaeologists who feel that the Wave of Advance model is less appropriate for western and northern Europe than it is for central and southeastern Europe. Nor does it deal with the central objection to my proposal, namely that the various broad relationships between the principal IndoEuropean language groups do not conform well geographically to the spatial relationships generated by the Wave of Advance. That seems to me a substantial and significant problem. But it is a difficulty which applies also to earlier explanations for the Indo-European language distribution. But I would continue to argue that there can be no alternative to the use of coherent and explicit models. For the processes o f change involved have to be faced, and therefore they have to be made explicit. That is all that model-building would claim to do.
E. Mythology and historical reality
The field of mythology like that of historical linguistics has difficulties with chronology. The point has been made earlier that a grasp of the underlying historical reality is essential. Although Dumezil evidently saw no need of a firm chronological framework within which to set the origin of the supposed relationships which he proposed, his whole edifice of inference without such a grasp is set upon shaky foundations. It is, however, with another point in the field of mythology, introduced by Professor Marija Gimbutas at the Bellagio Conference, that I wish to deal. This is the supposed hiatus in linguistic as well as mythological terms between the neolithic and chalcolithic o f South East Europe on the one hand and the succeeding bronze age on the other. Professor Gimbutas has drawn attention with very good effect to the rich symbolic complex seen in the neolithic and chalcolithic archaeology of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary and the Ukraine. With particular emphasis upon the terracotta figurines, she has coined the term "Old Europe" for the complex. She contrasts it with the succeeding early bronze age in these areas, which has indeed a different character. The latter she explains by the incursion from the east of her



Renfrew 23
"Kurgan" people, the supposed bearers o f the Proto-Indo-European language, with its accompanying culture and mythology. One may note first that in Pan-European terms these are relatively localized phenomena. But my own points here are different ones. They are, first, that a change in iconography does not necessarily betoken a profound change in the underlying belief system. And second that a change in belief system in no way need correlate with a change in language. So that while Professor Gimbutas may well be right in regarding the language of her Kurgan people as "Indo-European," there is no logic in the inference that the belief system of the previous "Old Europe" phase need be non IndoEuropean simply because its iconography is different from what follows. The term "Indo-European" is surely with propriety applied to languages. A s soon as we use it as a classificatory term for belief systems, for mythologies, we are embarking upon a serious category error. This point came through to me with particular clarity in a recent consideration of the prehistoric Aegean religions. For many years archaeologists have stressed the various similarities between the religions of the Minoan and Mycenaean worlds. And while I, myself, would distinguish sharply between them, there are indeed relationships between the iconographies. Both show a predominance of female anthropomorphic images (only slightly rectified by the recent find of male figurines at Phylakopi in M elos). These have at times been regarded by Professor Gimbutas and others as the descendants o f the allegedly female-oriented belief system of "Old Europe." But if so, what are we to make of the revelation that the Mycenaeans spoke an Indo-European (i.e. Greek) language? In The Archaeology o f C ulr I have suggested that we can see in the Aegean a whole series of religious transformations in which the iconography, and perhaps the underlying belief system, was re-structured. A series of such transformations can lead us from the early neolithic through to the religion o f Classical Greece. And we may note in passing that succeeding transformations have brought the Christian religion from the Near East to Greece and modified it in various ways. It is now as securely "Indo-European" in its linguistic expression as its predecessor: while the Old Testament was first set in writing in a Semitic language, the New Testament was first written in Greek. The underlying idea of religious and monographic transformation - whether or not accompanied by outside influences - is the crucial one here. It merits closer consideration both from the religious and the monographic standpoint. W ithout it we cannot expect the development of myths or of mythological systems to be understood properly. In particular it is difficult to see how a specific iconography or belief system can properly be designated as "non-Indo-European" without reliable prior information about the languages spoken by its adherents. Thus while I feel that Professor Gimbutas has greatly added to our knowledge of the period by her publication of the rich material of "Old Europe," it is for me difficult to see that her observations on this material bear significantly upon the Indo-European question. These are, of course, controversial matters, but that makes it all the more appropriate to concentrate upon the underlying methodology, the framework of inference. The Indo-European question is primarily a linguistic one, and can only be approached constructively if sufficient weight is accorded to the principle of linguistic autonomy asserted earlier. I have tried to discuss how the



24 When Worlds Collide
archaeological data may be brought into appropriate relationship with the linguistic data, and the task is evidently not an easy one. A comparable caution must surely be exercised when the rich field of mythology is to be used, either in relation to language or to archaeology. Until the appropriate methodology is established, assertions about either language or historical reality which are based upon data from the field of mythology cannot be regarded as well founded. In conclusion I would like to remark that a very positive feature of the Bellagio Conference was a willingness to re-examine previously unquestioned assumptions. It is perhaps fair to say that the enterprise of relating linguistic data to archaeological data is a more difficult one than has hitherto been appreciated. Each field of enquiry has its own methodology, its own rigor indeed, well established after decades of research. But the task of moving with assurance from one field to the other has not yet been undertaken with sufficient caution or sufficient rigor. Real progress was made at the Conference towards recognizng and re-defining these problems. This may prove to be its lasting contribution in this difficult, indeed perilous, field.

H ere we might infer that the proto-lexicon contained several words for the animal [horse].... or that the animal was known only in some areas of Proto-Indo-European speech and the original word *ekwos perhaps, was therefore dialectical and the others innovatory after the dispersal...... A single root across the languages would be conclusive for the proto-lexicon; a multiplicity of roots is inconclusive either way." 4. See A.

Did Armenians Live in Asia Anterior
Before the Twelfth Century B.C.?
Gevork B. Djahukian
(Linguistics Institute, Yerevan)
1. D uring the 19th century and the first decades o f the 20th century the
dom inating view was that at the end o f the 13th century and the beginning o f the
12th century A rm enians, among other "maritime peoples," most probably w ith
Phrygians, cam e to A sia M inor from the Balkan peninsula, lived there till the 6th
century B.C. and later settled in the area o f H istorical Armenia. On the basis o f
many facts and considerations an amendment was later made to this view that
A rm enians settled in the w estern part o f H istorical Arm enia as early as the
12th-11th centuries B.C. Y et this correction also fails to account for some existing
facts. There arises a necessity to reconsider the view that Armenians had appeared
in A sia A nterior only at the end o f the 13th century or in the beginning o f the
12th century B.C.
2. On the b asis o f th is view it is d iffic u lt to answ er, for exam ple, the
follow in g questions: (a) Is the sim ilarity of the forms ArmanamKl, ArmanimKl in
the inscriptions o f the third m illennium o f the Akkadian King Naram-Suen and
that o f A rm iK1 in the Ebla inscriptions with Urartian A rm e and the form o f
Arm ina in the Bihistun inscription o f Dareus the First com pletely accidental? (b)
W hy are Armenians not mentioned among maritime peoples? (c) W ere Armenians
close to Phrygians, as is supposed on the basis of the antique authors’ data, and if
so, why does the present-day science not reveal a close kinship of Armenian and
Phrygian to the extent o f forming one linguistic group?
3. The H ittite sou rces o f the 14th -13th cen tu ries B.C. m ention a certain
country H ayasa which presented a significant m ilitary force at the south-eastern
borders o f the H ittite state. Three different opinions concerning the tribes that had
inhabited H ayasa com e forth: (a) H ayasians were the ancestors of Armenians, and
the name o f their country was preserved in that o f Armenians (K. Roth, K. Forrer,
P. Kretchm er, G. Ghapantsian et al.); (b) Hayasians had nothing in common with
Arm enians, and the Armenian selfnam e hay originated from the form H ate (I.M.
D iak on off); (c) H ayasians sp oke a H ittite-L u vian lan gu age, w hich has been



26 When Worlds Collide
preserved as a substratum o f Armenian (G. Djahukian). The recent examination of
the H ayasian proper names led the author to the conclusion that the main
inhabitants of Hayasa were Armenians.
In the Hayasian list consisting o f about 40 items, there are anthroponyms,
theonyms, and toponyms the Armenian parallels of which are rather convincing,
being phonetically transitional between Indo-European forms and those occurring
in Armenian dialects. In this case, too, the author holds the contention that while
the presence o f H ittite-Luvian, Hurrian, and, presumably, other language elements
in Hayasian proper names is not enough evidence to prove the presence of the
tribes speaking those languages (these elements might merely be accounted for by
language contacts and borrowings), the presence of Armenian language elements
can be explained only by the presence of Armenian tribes. Here certain parallels
o f the type are given together with the corresponding Indo-European archetypes:
(1) toponyms: Hayas. H ay(asa) (rasa is the Hittite-Luvian toponyms) - Arm. hay <
IE * p o ti- ‘master’; Hayas. A z(z)i - Arm. a z- ‘dry’ (in the toponym A zord and the
reduplicative forms azazil ‘to dry’ and azazum ‘dried out’) < IE *az-gh- (from the
root *as- ‘to burn’; cf. Gr. «Co? ‘dry’ in the hydronym ’'ACcov); Hayas. A rziya
Arm s, a r c - (in the words a rca t' ‘silver,’ a rc a rc e l ‘to in flam e,’ a rcn el ‘to do
poker-w ork,’ and the toponyms A rcak, Arcap', Aren, Arche; A rziya reveals
correspondence with Aren) < IE*arg- ‘white, bright’; Hayas. In galaw a — Arm.
эп -k a l o n d -k a l- (in the verb ankalul ‘to receive,’ dial, ‘to close,’ 3rd p. aorist
snkalaw) *anti + *gwbl- fr. IE *geu- ‘to bend’) or angi (if Ingalawa corresponds to
the name Angi); Hayas. -h ila (in the toponym Lahirhila; cf. Hitt. H arsanhila,
Lumanhila, Parsanhila, etc., as well as Hilama, H ilam atiya; along with the place
names Hulaniya, Hulanta, Hulina, Hularu, Aparhulu, etc., it seems plausible that
the Hitt, word hila- ‘yard’ is a borrowing from Armenian) - Arm. hit, het, hiwt fr .
xut ‘hut’ (<*khu-lo- fr. IE *keu- ‘to cover’); (2) anthroponym s: Hayas. A isiy a
Arm. a yci ‘goat’ (fr. IE *aigiya fr. *aig~; cf. aye ‘goat’); Hayas. A n iya — Arm.
h ani ‘ancestor’ (> Georg, h ani ‘ancestor’), later ‘grandm other’ ( < [H ]aniya
Hayas. M a riya - Arm. m ari ‘she-bird’ (< *т ъпуа or *m briya- which is, perhaps,
borrowed in Hurr. M arianni ‘governor,’ Urart. m are ‘a nobleman’; the Hayasian
word is lik ely to have had the same source); (3) theonym s: Hayas. T erititu n i
Arm. eri < IE *tru- ‘three’ and ttun ‘tail’ (*erttun ‘three-tailed’); Hayas. E ililil



Arm. sitet ‘lover’ (fr. * k e i-i- fr. IE * k ei- ‘to lie; b eloved ,’ the source o f Arm.
ser ‘love,’ sireli ‘beloved’).
4. D ifferent investigators, namely G. Ghapantsian, J. Shultheiss, G. Djahukian,
J.A.C. Greppin, have revealed some Hittite-Luvian borrowings in Armenian that
could not be explained merely by the influence of the Hittite-Luvian languages
preserved after the 12th century B.C. and especially by Hieroglyphic Luvian. Quite
recently we succeeded in showing some words of Hittite whose source might have
been the Armenian (resp. Hayasa) language. A ll these facts are in favor of
plausible direct contacts between Armenians and Hittite-Luvians before the 12th
century B.C.
The sou rce o f the fo llo w in g Arm enian words may be considered
H ittite-Luvian languages: brut ‘potter,’ brteay ‘made o f clay,’ brtin (dial.) ‘clay’
H itt, p u r u t ‘c la y ’; c u x , - o y ‘s m o k e ’1 — H itt. t u h h u ( w a ) i - ‘s m o k e ’?;
d a n d ir n ‘sep u lch ra l d a rk n ess’ (or ‘pu trescen ce’?) - H itt, d a n d u - ‘d e a t h ’;
gorg ‘carpet’ — Hitt, ku rka- ‘cover(ing)’l h at-anel ‘cut (off)’ - Hitt, h a tta i- ‘cut
(off); split’; kstam bel (kstam b Instr. Case of kustn) ‘to reproach, to reprimand’ M
Hitt, ku sduw ai- ‘to reproach, to reprimand’; p'ax ‘flight, escape,’ p'axnul ‘to run
away, to escape’ M Hitt, p a rk - ‘drive, chase,’ parhanu- ‘chase’; p ‘sur ‘crumb, piece’
- Hitt, p a rsu lli- ‘crumb, piece’; s e tj (*selyo- ) ‘heap (of grain)’ - Hitt, se li- ‘heap
o f grain’; xalam ‘animal scull’ (xalamovin ‘with the head’) — Hitt, halanta ‘h ead ’;
xarn ‘m ixed,’ xarn el ‘to mix’ - Hitt, h arn a- ‘to mix’; x o ix o tel ‘to k ill’ - Hitt.
h u lh u liya - ‘to k ill in war’; etc. The Arm. proper name M u sei is an obvious
borrowing from Mursilis.
In the follow ing cases the source of the Hittite words might have been the
Armenian language: Arm. art ‘field ’ (< *arc- < *acr- < IE *agros) — Hitt, a rziy a
‘cultivated land,’ Luv. a r z iy a s s i- "(name o f a landpiece in Cappadocian texts)";
Arm. a sr ‘wool; fleece’ (IE *pokur) — Hitt, e s r i- (essa ri- ) ‘wool; fle e c e ’; Arm.
hac' ‘bread’ (*poifcwfM- fr. IE *pekw-) —1
Djahukian 27
1. H. Adjarian (HAB) was not right suggesting a "Caucasian source for the
Armenian word: Georg, quxwa ‘to grieve’ and mQuxri ‘twilight, dusk,’ which express
entirely different notions.



28 When Worlds Collide
Hitt. h a z(z)it/d a - (a kind of pastry); Arm. luc ‘yoke; weight, burden; hard labor’
(IE *yugom) - Hitt, luzzi- ‘forced labour’; etc.
A long w ith m utual H ittite-L u vian -A rm en ian borrowings there is a
considerable quantity of proper names in Hittite texts, having obvious Armenian
parallels, which testifies to the presence of Armenians in Asia Minor and on its
eastern borders. The assum ption that the Armenian words sa n t'ld ‘lightnin g’
(*kwnti- fr. IE keu- ‘to shine; bright’) and loys, Gen. lusoy ‘light’ (IE *leuk-) form
the base of the Asia-M inor deities Santas and Lusiti- is plausible; if the name of
the deity Zanduza has the stem Sand-, as supposes E. Laroche (1947), the Arm.
word sant'oc' can be reconstructed for it. It seems likely that the following deities,
too, have Armenian origin: A ndaliya (Earth God) - Arm. and ‘field ’ (IE *andh- ) ,
a n del ‘to till, to cultivate’; H u zziya — xuc‘ ‘cell’ (*khu-sko~ fr. IE *(s)keu - ‘to
cover’); Sulutta - Arm. solot ‘radiant’ fr. sol ‘ray’ (*kuol- fr. IE *keu- ‘to shine;
bright’); Zukki - Arm. juk-n ‘fish’ (IE *ghu- ); etc.
The follow ing proper names may be of Armenian origin: Aliwasu - A rm .
alues, -u ‘fo x ’ < IE *э1ореки-\ Anni (cf. Hayas. A nniya); A rziuta - Arm. arciw ,
arcui ‘eagle’ < IE *rgipiyo~; the Armenian word was borrowed also in Urartian
(A r$ibedini - a deity), Georgian (arciw i ‘eagle’) and other Caucasian languages;
Tatta - Arm. t‘at‘ ‘hand, paw,’ as well as T‘a‘ a proper name (also T'at'ik, T'at'ul),
etc.
In the toponym s o f H ittite texts the Armenian layer is considerable, too.
Besides the above-mentioned Arm. sant'ld ‘lightning’ and loys, Gen. lusoy, that are
met in certain toponyms principally via the corresponding theonyms (Santasara,
Santima, Tapasanta, Zarasantiya, Lusa, Lusna, Tapilusa, Zihlusa), there are many
parallels in hydronym s, oronyms and other toponyms, based on Armenian
appellatives (esp. if the latter are of IE origin) or those borrowed by Armenian.
Hydronyms: A lt/da, Altldani — Arm. alt ‘dirt’ (*l-d- fr. IE *el-) or a h -t ‘salt’
(IE * sa l-d -), Anza/i — anc' ‘passage’; Ululi — Arm. оtot ‘flood’ (IE *pel-)\ Wettihu
Arm. get ‘river’ (IE *wed- before the shift *w > g), etc.
Oronyms: K a p a k a p a — Arm. к а р ‘tie, bond; connection; com m unication,’
kap a n ‘pass, gorge, d efile,’ dial. k a p (a )k a p el ‘to tie’; K a m a - Arm. K 'ar, p i.
k 'a rin k ' ‘ston e’ (IE * k a r - or * (s)ker-1)-, K u n tiy a - Arm. k u n tld ‘b a ld ’ (IE
*(s)ken~d~); Sunara M Arm. snar ‘mountain peak; nape; pillow* (*sunar), etc.



Djahukian 29
N am es o f p op u lated places: A la tr a - Arm. a ta l ‘to grind’; there is an
A rm en ia n top on ym A to r i- k ' with a late sh ift aw > о); A n k a liy a - A rm .
angt ‘vulture’ (cf. the Arm. toponyms Angt, Angeltun); Artus, Artuk — Arm. art,
- o y ‘fie ld ’ (IE * a g ro s); A ru n a — Arm. a riw n ‘b lood ’ (IE * e s r -; cf. the Arm.
toponyms Arun, Arum, Агипк'У, H azka M Arm. hac‘ ‘bread’ (*pokwti- fr. IE *pekw;
cf. the Arm. toponyms H ac'ik, Hac'kni); K a rk a r - Arm. k a rk a r ‘sto n e p ile ’;
Katarka - Arm. katar ‘summit, top’; Kawarna — Arm. kawarn ‘channel, trench’ (IE
* g e u -l)\ P a la p a la s a - Arm. p lp la k 'a r ‘big ston e’ (IE * b e l-); T a la — A rm .
t'al ‘district, block’; T u hu piya - Arm. t'uxp ‘cloud’; U r та - Arm. orm ‘w all’
0* o rk -m o - along IE * a rek -1 ); Z u nah ara — Arm. jiw n (a )h a r ‘sn o w b e a ten ’ fr.
jiwn ‘snow’ (IE *ghiiom) and har-ul ‘to beat’ (IE *per-)\ etc.
5. A rm enian has b orrow ed from Hurrian the words a n a g ‘tin ’ (H urr.
anagi along Assyr. anaku and Sumer, niggi, naggu), xnjor ‘apple’ (Hurr. hinzuri) ,
nurn ‘pom egranate’ (Hurr. nuranti fr. Akkad, n urim du), etc. It is possible to
suppose certain connection between the Hurr. hai- ‘small’ (along the proper Hurr.
zugi- ‘small’) and the Arm. hayk ‘small.’
6. A certain layer may be separated in the Armenian language directly or
indirectly tracing back to the Akkadian language. Taking into consideration the
fact that Old Akkadian has had no influence upon Armenian, we may date the
Akkadian-Arm enian contacts to XX-VII centuries B.C. Two sources of borrowings
may be separated: the Akkadian colonies in Asia Minor. These Colonies must have
been especially influential in the period when the country Hayasa existed. This
w ill appear more probable if the proper name Кат ах, supposedly attested in the
Hayasian K a m i, really originates from the Akkad. kimah(h)u(m) (gimahu) ‘grave’
(there were graves o f Armenian kings in Kamax), as suggested by H. Adjarian (2,
605); this word is preserved in the Arm. km ax-k‘ ‘remains’ and km axi-k' ‘funeral
cry.’ From the other Akkadian borrowings in Armenian the following words are
w orth m entioning: an aw t' ‘v e sse l, fu rn itu re, instrum ent, w eap on ’ (N A ssyr.
anutu(m ) along unutu(m), enutufm) ‘instrument, device; belonging; furniture’),
gagat'n ‘peak’ (Akkad, k lqaqqadu (m ) ‘head; upper part,’ kn ik‘ ‘s e a l’ (A k k ad.
k a n iku lm ) ‘sealed document,’ kunukku(m ) ‘seal’), k sir ‘scales; w eigh t’ Akkad.
gisrinnuim) ‘scales’), p'ox ‘loan’ (Akkad. piih(m) ‘loan; substitution’), etc.
There are some Armenian borrowings in Akkadian. The Akkadian word for



30 When Worlds Collide
apricot and apricot-tree armannu(m) obviously goes back to the name of Armenian
tribes (cf. the Syriac word for apricot hazziira агт эпауа ‘Armenian apple.’ If the
Arm. xuc‘ ‘cell’ goes back to the *kh u -sko- fr. IE *(s)keu- ‘to cover’ (cf. also
xut ‘hut’ fr. * k h u -lo-) and bo tk ‘radish’ goes back to the IE * b h el- ‘to sprout,’
which is. also the source o f b o t(ik ) ‘sprout, bud’ and b o lb o ) ‘bud,’ it may be
supposed that they w ere borrowed into Akkadian: hussu(m ) ‘can e hut’ and
pugla ‘radish’ (cf. Aram, pugla).
7. The existence o f a few Old Indie borrowings in Hurrian brought the
scholars to the presumption that in the middle o f the 2nd millennium B.C. Indian
tribes lived in Asia Anterior. This gave rise to controversial opinions (cf.
Mayrhofer, 1966; Kammenhuber, 1968; Diakonoff, 1970, 39-63; Mayrhofer, 1974).
The above-m entioned borrowings, in connection with the Hayas. M ariya, H urr.
m ariyanni ‘nobleman’ and Urart. m are ‘nobleman’ belong to this type. If Hayasian
was a language where Old Indie words had penetrated and really is the oldest
state o f Armenian, Armenian words going back to Old Indie must have been
preserved independently of Iranian. One of such words is, first of all, the Arm.
m armin ‘body’ (OInd. m arm an- ‘part of the body’ originating from the IE *mel—,
the shift *1 > r is not characteristic of Armenian). The words ja m b ‘fo o d ’ and
jam bel ‘to cut the food; to feed’ should be included in this group, too (cf. OInd.
jam bha- ‘tooth; swallowing,’ jam b hate ‘to snap at’). To this group belong also the
words that, according to W. Porzig, had been borrowed in the middle of the 2nd
millennium B.C. on the Northern coast of the Black Sea.
8. The famous K artvelist H. Vogt contended that there were no Armenisms in
Common Kartvelian and Georgio-Zanian, consequently in those periods there were
no contacts between Armenians and Kartvelians, and Armenians still lived o ff the
Caucasus. Glottochronological investigations show that the Common Kartvelian
broke down approxim ately by the 19th century B.C., while the Georgio-Zanian
unity broke down approxim ately by the 8th century B.C. [Klimov, 1964, 85]. A
more detailed analysis shows that Vogt’s contention is rather weak.
There is a considerable number of lexical correlations between Armenian,
Georgian, and Zanian, which, at least partly, can be ascribed to the period of
G eorgio-Zanian unity, i.e. to the 18th—9th centuries B.C. There is also a small
number o f words common in Armenian, Georgian, Zanian, and Swanian, but it is



impossible to date them in the full conviction at least partly to the period of
Common Kartvelian, i.e. to the 19th century B.C.
W e shall first consider the words common for Armenian and Georgio-Zanian.
The first layer consists of original Armenian words that have penetrated into
G eorgio-Zanian (Georgian and Zanian): Arm. arcaV ‘silver’ (IE * a r g 3 to -7 )- G Z
*wercix[~, also Avar, harac, Lak. area, Darg. arc, Tab. ars, Arch, ars (for w e - cf.
Arm. o r j ‘male,’ y o rj ‘wether’ and GZ *werdzl~- ‘wether’); Arm. bu rd- ‘w ool’ (dial.
‘p;umage’) and b rd e l ‘to cut to pieces’ (IE *bh erdh -) - Gz * b u rd ya - ‘plum age’;
Arm. gini, Gen. -w o y ‘wine’ (IE *w iniyo-) - GZ *yw in o- ‘wine’; Arm. orb, G en.
- o y ‘orphan’ (IE *orbho~) — GZ *obol~, also Abkg. - ib a , Kab. ib e, C h ec h .
bo ‘orphan’; Arm. o rj ‘male,’ yo rj ‘wether’ - GZ *werdzl- ‘wether’; etc.
The second layer of Armenian-Georgio-Zanian lexical coincidences comprises
Georgio-Zanian borrowings in Armenian: GZ *con- ‘to w eigh’ - Arm. canr, G en.
canu ‘heavy’; GZ *qleb o - ‘to glue,’ qxeb o - ‘glue’ - Arm. cep', Gen. - o y ‘moulding’;
GZ *lfrt-w i}~ ‘to look for sth with the beak; pluck,’ n i-lc a rt- ‘b ea k ’ - Arm.
ktuc' ‘beak’; etc.
There are quite a few A rm enian-K artvelian coincidences - Armenian
borrowings in the Kartvelain: Arm. arciw , arcui ‘eagle’ (IE * rg ip iyo -) - Georg.,
Zan., Swan, arqiwi ‘eagle,’ also Chech, arm , Ingush, arzi and Urart. Ar$ibini\ Arm.
tiz ‘tick’ (IE *digh~) - Kartv. *ffz1- ‘louse’ (Georg. t.il~, Megr. ti(j)-, Chan. m(i~,
Swan. (is-).
The probability o f Armenian-Kartvelian language contacts in the period of
Hayasa, taking into account the geographical position of Hayasa, is rather high.
The Luv. word tld a w i- is probably a borrowing from a Kartvelian source: Georg.
tw al-, Megr., Chan, tol-, Swan, te -lter- ‘eye.’

DOMESTICATION OF PLANTS IN THE OLD WORLD:
THE EMERGING SYNTHESIS
Daniel Zohary
Department of Genetics The Hebrew University Jerusalem, 91904, Israel
INTRODUCTION
South West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley (the "Old World") are unique today as to the extent of their archaeobotanical exploration. In the last 30 years hundreds of prehistoric sites have been excavated all over these territories. Plant remains in many sites have been expertly determined, culturally associated and radiocarbon dated. The finds already identified the plants that started agriculture in the Old World, and established (in general terms) where and when their domestication could have taken place. Parallel progress has been achieved in the study of the living plants. The wild progenitors of almost all the principal food crops of the Old World have been soundly identified by comparative morphology and by genetic tests. Comparisons between the wild-types and their cultivated counterparts revealed the evolutionary changes which were brought about by domestication. The geographic distributions of the wild progenitors provided dues where their domestication could have taken place. As a result of these achievements, the Old World emerges as the first major part of the Earth in which the combined evidence from the archaeology and the living plants permits a new synthesis of crop plant domestication. Such an assessment was recently made by Zohary and Hopf (1988)\ and this paper summarizes the main conclusions arrived at by these authors. For a more detailed, crop-wise survey of what is known on the origin and spread of cultivated plants in West Asia, Europe and Egypt the reader is referred to this recent publication. Furthermore, it was felt unnecessary to list again the numerous reports and publications dted in the Zohary and Hopf book. In this paper references are given only when amendments were made or when new facts were incorporated.

THE NEAR EAST NEOLITHIC CROP ASSEMBLAGE
The first definite signs of plant cultivation in the Old World appear in a string of early Neolithic farming villages that developed in the Near East in the 8th and 7th millennia be. (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic В cultures). The initiation of food production in this "nuclear area” is based on the domestication of a relatively small number (8-9 species) of local wild grain plants. The start of plant cultivation in the Near East was accompanied by domestication of several animals. Sheep and goat were the first to be brought under human control, and they were soon followed by cattle and swine. Three cereals, namely emmer wheat Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccum, barley Hordeum vulgare and einkorn wheat Triticum monococcum (and in this order of importance) were the main founder crops of the Near East Neolithic agriculture. Diagnostic morphological traits (non-brittle ears, plump kernels) traceable in the archaeological finds indicate that by 7800-7500 be emmer wheat and barley were intentionally sown and harvested in the Near East.^ Very likely einkorn wheat was domesticated in the same time. Yet definite indications on the cultivation of this wheat are available, at present, only from the end of the 8th millennium be. Map 1 shows the main early Neolithic Near East sites from which remains of these three cereals were uncovered. In both emmer wheat and barley one faces rapid development under domestication. Already in one or two sites dated to the 7th millennium be, one finds traces of more "modern" derivatives of these crops. Cultivated emmer wheat, with its characteristic invested grains, gave rise to free threshing durum-type forms in which threshing releases the naked grains. Cultivated hulled two-rowed barley gave rise to six-rowed cultigenes and again also to varieties with naked grains. Several additional grain crops appear as constant companions of wheats and barley. Most frequent in the early Neolithic Near East contexts are lentil Lens culinaris, pea Pisum sativum and flax Linum usitatissimum. Remains of two other legumes namely chickpea Cicer arietinum and bitter vetch Vida ervilia were uncovered as well, but they are more sporadic in their appearance (for orientation on sites from which lentil, pea and flax were retrieved consult Map 1). In contrast to the cereals, remains of pulses and flax usually lack morphological features by which initial stages of domestication can be recognized. Clear indication of lentil cultivation is now available from 6800 bc.^ Definite signs of flax, pea, chickpea and bitter vetch cultivation appear only at about 6000 be. Yet probably all these four grain crops were taken into cultivation somewhat earlier, either together with wheats and barley or soon after the domestication of these cereals. The origin of another important Old World pulse, namely the broad bean Исш faba, has not yet been satisfactorily clarified. But a recent discovery of a hoard of seed in a Pre-Pottery Neolithic В site in North Israel indicates that broad bean, too, may have been a member of the Neolithic Near East crop assemblage.

WILD PROGENITORS
The wild ancestors of the majority of the food plants grown in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile valley are already well identified. The distribution areas and the main ecological preferences of most of these wild progenitors are also well elucidated. Comparison of this evidence with the archaeological information reveals that with practically all early crops the first signs of cultivation appear in the same general areas where the wild ancestral stock abound today. The geographic distribution of the wild progenitors of the Neolithic grain crops is indeed significant. Apart from flax and barley the wild ancestors of the founder crops have a rather limited distribution. Wild emmer wheat, wild chickpea and wild bitter vetch are endemic to the Near East. Assuming that their distribution did not change drastically dining the last ten millennia, the domestication of these crops could only have taken place in this restricted area. Wild forms of einkorn wheat, lentil and pea have a somewhat wider distribution, but all, as well as barley, are centered in the Near East, i.e. the region in which the earliest farming villages have been discovered.
THE SPREAD OF THE NEAR EAST CROPS
A most remarkable feature of the Neolithic agriculture is the rapid expansion it underwent soon after its establishment in the Near East nuclear area. The quality and quantity of the archaeobotanical evidence varies considerably from region to region. Comprehensive information is available from the Balkan countries, and from central and western Europe, but there is much sparser and frequently incomplete documentation from Russia, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. In Africa, critical data on plant remains are available only from Egypt. In spite of such uneven documentation, the following main features of the diffusion seem apparent. The spread of agriculture from its nuclear area to Europe and Central Asia was based on the Near East plants. The same crops that started food production in the Near East "arc" also initiated agriculture in these vast territories. Map 2 summarizes the expansion of the six most important Near East crops: emmer wheat (including its free threshing derivatives), einkorn wheat, barley, lentil, pea and flax. From the data assembled on this map it is evident that the crops domesticated in the Near East were also the starting elements of food production in Europe, Central Asia, the Indus basin, and the Nile valley. The earliest farming cultures all over these vast regions always contain wheats and barley. One, two or more other Near East founder crops are frequently present in the sites as well.



38 When Worlds Collide
The spread of the Near East crop assemblage both westwards (to Europe) and eastwards (to Central Asia and to the Indian subcontinent) was a quick process (Map 2). Already in the beginning of the 6th millennium be, agriculture (based on the Near East crop assemblage) appeared in Greece. By the end of the 6th millennium be, these crops were grown in Starcevo in the Danubian basin, in Merimde in the Nile Valley, in Chokh in the Caspian Sea basin and in Mehrgarh in Pakistan. Less than 800 years later the Danubian (Bandkeramik) culture was already firmly established in loess soil regions all over central Europe, extending west to north France. At more or less the same time (and perhaps somewhat earlier) farming villages of the Impressed Ware (Cardial) culture appeared on the shores of the west Mediterranean Sea and reached south Spain. All over those vast areas the start of food production depended on the same crops.
EARLY DOMESTICATION OUTSIDE THE NUCLEAR AREA
Signs of additional domesticates start to appear soon after the introduction of the Near East agriculture to Europe, Central Asia and the Nile Valley. The addition of some of these crops obviously took place outside the Near East but within the already established cultivation of the Near East crop assemblage. The poppy Papaver somniferum, provides a well documented example for such domestication. Both the area of distribution of the wild poppy and the archaeological finds indicate that P. somniferum was brought into cultivation in West Europe. The poppy was locally added to the Near East grain crop assemblage after the latter was established in West Europe. Chufa Cyperus esculentum, provides a similar example of an early local addition, this time in the Nile Valley. Its dry tubers were found in large quantities in Egypt from predynastic times on. Grass pea Lathyms sativus, is obviously a Neolithic minor crop but probably not a Near East domesticate. A recent studjr showed that the more definite early signs of its cultivation come from 6th and 5th millennia be Greece. The early appearance of the common millet Panicum miliaceum, in the Caspian basin (5th millennium be), might indicate another local addition. However, since the archaeological evidence from central and east Asia is still inadequate, it is impossible to decide whether P. miliaceum was locally added to the expanding Near East agriculture after it reached central Asia, or whether this cereal represents an east Asiatic domestication - independent of the Near East diffusion. Another Neolithic development outside the nuclear area was the emergence of breadwheat Triticum aestivum, which today is economically the most important wheat crop. Breadwheat is an independent wheat species which originated, under domestication, by hybridization between cultivated emmer or durum forms of Triticum turgidum with a wild wheat grass Aegilops squarrosa (for details on origin consult Zohary and Hopf 1988, p. 45 and Table 2). The earliest signs of breadwheat come from the 5th millennium be Transcaucasia.
BEGINNINGS AND SPREAD OF HORTICULTURE
Olive Olea europaea, grape vine Vitis vinifera, fig Ficus carica and date palm Phoenix dactytifera seem to have been the first principal fruit crops domesticated in the



Old World. Definite signs of olive, grape vine** and date palm cultivation appear in Chalcolithic sites (3700-3500 be) in Israel and Jordan, and by the 4th millennium be date palm cultivation seems to have been practised also in lower Mesopotamia. Also the fig was most probably taken into cultivation in the Levant in the same time. Except for Palestine, the archaeobotanical information on 4th millennium be sites in other parts of the Levant is insufficient and we still know very little how extensive horticulture was in Chalcolithic times. The picture changes in the Early Bronze Age (first half of the 3rd millennium be). From this time on olives, grapes and figs emerge as important additions to grain agriculture in the Levant and somewhat later also in Greece. The extensive cultivation of olives and grapes in the late Bronze Age is reflected by the appearance of numerous presses and remains of storage facilities for olive oil and for wine. Contemporarily, dates were cultivated on the southern fringes and the warm river basins of the Near East "arc." Somewhat later the cultivation of dates appears also in the Nile Valley and dates become very common in Egyptian Kingdom contexts. New Apple Malus pumila, pear Pyrus communis, plum Prunus domestica and cherry Prunus avium seem to have been added to the Old World horticulture much later. Definite signs of their cultivation appear only in the 1st millennium be. Their culture is based almost entirely on grafting. Very likely they could have been domesticated and successfully cultivated only after the introduction of this sophisticated method of vegetative propagation. The available archaeobotanical evidence on the beginning of fruit crop domestication is also supported by information on the wild relatives. Wild olive, grape, fig and date are widely distributed over the Mediterranean basin and southwest Asia. Because they have a wide geographic distribution, they do not provide critical clues for a precise delimitation of the place of origin of their respective crops. Yet it is assuring to know that forms from which the cultivated clones could have been derived thrive in wild niches in the east Mediterranean basin. Thus the evidence from the living plants complements the archaeological finds. Most probably olive, grape vine, date, fig, as well as pomegranate Punica granatum and almond Amygdalus communis were first brought into cultivation in the same general area which several millennia earlier saw the successful establishment of grain agriculture in the Old World. Chalcolithic and Bronze Age cultures in the east Mediterranean basin are characterized not only by the use of copper and bronze; 4th millennium be human societies in that region had also mastered horticulture.

VEGETABLES
This is the least known group among the cultivated plants of the Old World. Vegetable material, brought home, consists almost entirely of perishable soft tissues. Such elements stand meager chances to char and thus to survive in archaeological contexts. Thus only scant remains of vegetable crops have been detected in archaeological excavations. The only exception is Egypt. In this arid country vegetables placed in pyramids and graves commonly survived by desiccation. These remains show that garlic Allium sativum, onion Allium сера, leek Allium porrum, melon Cucumis melo, watermelon Citmllus lanatus, lettuce Lactuca sativa, beet Beta vulgaris and chufa Cyperus esculatum were cultivated in the Nile Valley in the 2nd and the 1st millennia be;



40 When Worlds Collide
and that vegetable gardens constituted an important element of food production in dynastic Egypt. Outside Egypt there is almost no early archaeobotanical evidence of vegetable crops. It seems, however, that by the 2nd millennium be vegetable gardens flourished in several agricultural provinces in southwest Asia. The distribution areas of the wild plants indicate that some of the Egyptian domesticates (e.g. garlic or onion) are not native in the Nile Valley. They had to be introduced from West Asia. In addition, several early documents and linguistic considerations point to the early use of vegetables in Mesopotamia. But we do not know how extensive gardening was, which were the main vegetable crops, and when and where they were brought into cultivation.
LATE COMERS
A major wave of new crops arrived to the near East in the first millennium be. It brought into this region both Asiatic and African elements. Warm weather crops comprise the largest group among these immigrants. They include sorghum Sorghum bicolor, sesame Sesamum indicum, rice Oryza sativa and Old World cotton Gossypium arboreum. These crops started in the Mediterranean countries the tradition of summer crops, which since classical times, became an integral element of food production in these territories. Archaeobotanical evidence indicates that rice, sorghum, sesame and cotton were part of Indian agriculture already in the second millennium be. All appear in Harappan sites. However, while rice and sesame are south and east Asiatic elements, sorghum is not. Very likely the latter was taken into cultivation in East Africa. It was first introduced from there to the Indian subcontinent and only from India it was eventually transported to the Near East. A second group of later comers arriving from the east comprises several fruit trees. Prominent among them are the apricot Armeniaca vulgaris and the peach Persica vulgaris. Both are cool climate elements that appeared in the Near East and the Mediterranean basin only at the end of the 1st millennium be. Another, even earlier, immigrant is the citron Citron medica. This is the first representative of the southeast Asiatic citrus fruits to arrive in the Mediterranean basin.'

Wild emmer does not grow today in the Damascus basin (the climate is far too dry for its survival). Very probably it did not occur in this xeric basin also in early Neolithic times. Thus as van Zeist and BakkerHeeres argue it is reasonable to assume that emmer wheat was introduced into Tell Aswad as a cultivated crop. The earliest remains of non-brittle barley, i.e. forms that could survive only under cultivation come from Pre-Pottery Neolithic A Netiv Hagdud, North of Jericho, see: Kislev, M.E., O.

THE INDO-EUROPEAN IMPACT ON THE HURRIAN
WORLD
by Charles Burney
For the purposes of this contribution to the Bellagio meeting1, the Hurrian world may be delineated both in space and in time, the dimensions being perhaps rather wider than might be expected by some. The views represented here are of course essentially those of an archaeologist, but of one prepared, hopefully, to learn much from the opportunity provided by the Bellagio symposium to compare approaches to problems of common interest with linguists whose training has necessarily been very different from my own. When one is no longer prepared to listen, then is the time to retire from the fray. At the time when this paper was delivered, early in the program, it was already becoming clear that much would be gained from this meeting of minds. One could not help envying those speaking later, who would thus have the benefit of more contributions on which to draw for any fine tuning! The interpretation of the Hurrian role in the ancient Near East is my own: certainly it will not command unanimous support. Any such popular consensus would not be worth the paper it was printed on. At its maximum geographical extent the Hurrian world stretched from the Caucasus to northern Mesopotamia; westward into northern Syria and towards the eastern marches of central Anatolia; and eastward into the Urmia basin and northwestern Iran. The evidence for this wide distribution of Hurrians is of course not all of one and the same period. In time-span the Hurrian world emerges in the early to middle fourth millennium B.C., on one interpretation in the Georgian S.S.R., where the settlement of Shulaveri, not far from Tbilisi, has revealed round houses dating well back into the fifth millennium B.C., possible prototypes of ETC round houses; and where local pottery may be seen as leading into that of the ETC I sub-period.2 The Hurrian world persists until the obscure time of the fall of the kingdom of Urartu (Van) (c.590 B.C.). One school of thought would argue the survival of Hurrians in the disguise of Armenians, though that controversial and complex question cannot be pursued here.4



The weight of archaeological and linguistic evidence indicates an IndoEuropean impact on the Human world at various periods across an arc from west through north to east, but at no time from the south. Frankly speaking, the notion of an Proto-Indo-European homeland in the north of Syria-Mesopotamia in the region once forming - during the sixth millennium B.C. - the habitat of the well-known Halaf culture, whose most significant excavated site is Tell Arpachiyah close to Mosul, will not bear serious scrutiny. The general indications of the archaeological evidence favor the belief that the Sumerians most probably settled in Mesopotamia at least from the sixth millennium B.C., making them the earliest settlers in the south: Diakonoffs suggestion that the Sumerians arrived in the early fourth millennium B.C., implying their association with the advent of the Uruk culture, seems untenable, and probably finds fewer adherents than it would have done a generation ago.6 Archaeological and historical evidence of any significant Indo-European impact from the west, i.e. through or from central Anatolia, is minimal until the twelfth century B.C., with the raids by the Mushki7 (affecting only the southwestern areas of the Hurrian world) and the arrival of the Armenians in the seventh-sixth centuries B.C. It was more a question of the Hurrian impact on central Anatolia, especially in the period of the karum of Kanesh,8 and on the Hittite court, dynasty and religion. It is in Cilicia - Kizzuwatna (Late Bronze Age), Que (Iron Age), when the hill country along the foot of the Taurus was designated Hilakku - that it seems possible to discern an Indo-European (Luvian) element settling in the Early Bronze III period, around the mid-third millennium B.C., with ceramic parallels with northwestern Anatolia, such as the Troy V-type red-cross bowls, long recognized as a diagnostic form.1 Then, however, in the Cilician Middle Bronze Age, from not later than c. 2100 B.C., painted pottery of north Syrian type, very non-Anatolian in character, seems to indicate the arrival of elements from the east, plausibly to be seen as being of Hurrian origin, and having affinities with pottery from Tell Atchana (Alalakh) in the Amuq plain.11 This will explain the undoubted Hurrian presence in Cilicia (Kizzuwatna) in the time of the Hittite New Kingdom or Empire, when Pudu-Hepa, the queen of Hattusilis П1, introduced Hurrian cultic traditions to the imperial court at Hattusha. Yet there, it seems, the royal family itself was of Hurrian extraction, adopting Indo-European (Hittite) names only on accession.12 The one king not to do so, Urhi-Teshub, was perhaps significantly deposed by his uncle. Is there here a hidden hint of IndoEuropean-Hurrian friction? This is unlikely ever to be known. An Indo-European impact from the north, penetrating the Near East through the Caucasus, may possibly be discernible in the adoption of barrow (kurgan) burial in the northern part of the vast Early Trans-Caucasian (ETC) cultural zone,13 argued by the writer to have been the Hurrian homeland.14 This does not require acceptance of the tenets of what may be termed "Kurganology."15 Gimbutas is, however, quite correct in emphasizing the lack of archaeological support for any ethnic movement at this time from south to north, as proposed by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov.16 There is also evidence, albeit hardly conclusive, of intrusive elements of northern origin in the ETC zone during the third millennium B.C.: at a symposium in Los Angeles (1982) the writer argued for a possible Indo-Iranian presence in northwestern Iran during the third millennium B.C., as a tentative suggestion.17 Unless the traditional theory of the arrival of the Hittites from the Caucasus into central Anatolia (c.2000 B.C.) is adhered to, a
46 When Worlds Collide



theory by now surely outdated,18 the next Indo-European impact from the north took the form of movements of Cimmerians and Scyths (c.715-612 B.C.), long known as being of Iranian stock and continuing the devotion to kurgan burial, introduced throughout much of Anatolia by the Phrygians.19 Indo-European impact on the Hurrian world from the east took different forms, and is harder to distinguish in some respects. In the mid-second millennium B.C. pottery of the type now termed "Urmia ware"20 penetrated, by whatever mechanism, into the Van region,21 perhaps at about the same time as die long-known Indo-European maryannu and ruling class, with their Indie language, appear in the kingdom of Mitanni.22 Archaeological evidence of that movement is lacking. It must have penetrated from Iran, perhaps more or less simultaneously with the expansion of the Iranian tribes from the northeast (Gurgan and parts of Khorassan) and possibly also through the Caucasus, marking the start of the Iron I period (c.1500-1100 B.C.) in Iran:23 the distinctive Iron I grey ware does not, to the writer's knowledge, occur in Mitanni, although it has been found at sites in the Mus plain, just west of lake Van.24 In the obscure period preceding the emergence of the kingdom of Urartu (Van), northwestern Iran seems to have witnessed a mingling of Indo-European with Hurrian elements, the Mannaeans being Hurrian-related. The Medes were of course beginning to come within the purview of the Assyrian kings, from the reign of Shalmaneser III onwards.25 Iranian elements may be detected in the formative phase of Urartu during the later ninth century B.C., notably in the links with the city of Musasir and in the long list of offerings to deities, headed by Haldi followed by Tesheba and Shivini, in the rock inscription of Mehr Kapisi ("Mithra's Gate") dose to the later Rusa-Citadel, better known as Toprakkale. Iranian elements have likewise been detected at Musasir, perhaps the home city of the new dynasty established by Sarduri I at Van: with Musasir was closely associated the cult of Haldi. There are, moreover, indubitable links between Hasanlu IV and Urartu (c.800 B.C.).27 As for the Hasanlu gold bowl, which the writer had the privilege of drawing directly after its excavation (1958), Edith Porada's interpretation of the complex iconography in terms of the Hurrian epic of Kummarbi seems irrefutable.28 Given the links, albeit not quite as direct as once supposed, between the Hurrian and Urartian languages,29 the artistic clues (e.g. deities standing on animals or mythical creatures) and the lack of any evidence of a break in the continuity of the Hurrian occupation of their old (ETC) homeland, Urartu may surely be safely considered essentially Hurrian, with Assyrian external influences the strongest. Horseriding and irrigation engineering were the Urartian achievements especially admired by Sargon II (714 B.C.). To attribute all or even most equestrian skills in the ancient Near East to Indo-European elements simply on the evidence of the Kikkuli text would be absurd.31 The Hurrians were clearly equally proficient. What too of the famous Mari tablet wherein Bahdi-Lim, the vizier, rebukes Zimri-Lim the king for riding on horseback in public instead of merely in a chariot?32 That must have come well before the Indo-European element arrived in Mitanni. Migrations must have played their part, whatever current archaeological doctrine at some great universities may be! Is it really credible that migrations were of only slight significance in prehistoric times, yet played so prominent a part in the decline and fall of the Roman empire and its sequel? What of the Scyths, the
Burney 47



Sarmatians, the Goths or the Huns?33 What can be said is that migrations are very hard to prove on archaeological data alone. "Kurganology" requires an element of faith to be accepted. Yet its rejection need not even imply uncritical acceptance of symbolism and ranking or peer-polity exchange as major factors in prehistoric societies in the Near East or elsewhere. It goes without saying that all these ideas merit close examination, in a strictly empirical approach: they are not to be adopted uncritically, in a spirit intolerant of widely differing approaches or demanding adherence to fashionable thinking. Theology and archaeology are uneasy bedfellows: after the Bellagio gathering it would be unjust and ungracious to suggest that there is a comparable gulf between archaeology and linguistics. Certainly creditable efforts were made to narrow this divide.34 As this contributor made clear in the discussions conducted at Bellagio, it seems quite an untenable proposition to identify a Proto-Indo-European substratum extending over the whole highland zone of the Near East by c.7000 B.C., i.e. in Neolithic times,35 with a Semitic homeland in Saudi Arabia. This would imply a Hurrian occupation of Indo-European held territories in what later became the Early Trans-Caucasian zone, from the mid-fourth to the end of the third millennium B.C. Attractive as may be the notion of a Proto-Indo-European substratum, in due course overlaid by Hurrian incomers, this remains a construct of those involved in research into proto-lexicons, a model for which there is as yet no evidence whatsoever on the ground. Since the discussion revolves around a period millennia before the appearance of written records, archaeology alone can provide the required evidence, and archaeology is silent.36 How much significance should be attached to the juxtaposition of distinct ethnic groups cohabiting, or at least co-existing, at Catal Huyuk in the seventh millennium B.C.? These comprise Proto-Mediterraneans (c.59%), Eurafricans (c.17%) and Armenoids (c.24%).37 Are we to see the last group as Proto-IndoEuropeans? There seems to be general agreement that the two other groups represent direct descendants of Upper Palaeolithic communities. One thing stands out clearly: the population of the Anatolian plateau was already in the seventh millennium B.C. very mixed. This must surely make the task of locating the Proto-Indo-European homeland, there or elsewhere, that much more difficult. The final stages of the Indo-European impact on Urartu and thus on the Hurrian world must be mentioned briefly. In northwestern Iran the Scyths have left their name in that of the town of Sakkiz, recalling the Sakai; and twenty miles away stands the massive Mannaean fortress of Ziwiye (Izibia in the Assyrian records), best known for the rich contents of a bronze tub, buried c.600 B.C. or slightly earlier, including couchant stags and other motifs related to the so-called "Animal Style" and thus to the steppes north of the Caucasus.38 Not far southwest of Lake Urmia, the tumuli of Se Girdan ("three mounds") provide another hint of the presence, however fleeting, of northern nomads of Indo-European affinity.39 Discoveries in a 1978 survey around Meshkinshahr, west of Ardebil and not far south of the River Araxes, included the major stronghold of Arjaq Qale, on the evidence of surface pottery probably dating to the sixth century B.C. Here there were also earlier stelae, of a type attributed by some Soviet archaeologists to the Cimmerians, although on rather uncertain evidence.4 Particularly intriguing is the question of the arrival in Urartu of the Armenians. There seems no reason to discount the Classical sources associating the Armenian
48 When Worlds Collide



Burney 49
language with Phrygian.41 Infiltration by small Armenian groups into the western provinces of Urartu during the seventh century B.C., before the fall of the kingdom, seems perfectly possible. It is regrettable that only rather meager written records survive from the long and active reign of Rusa П (c.685-645 B.C.).42 Intermarriage with the indigenous Hurro-Urartian majority population would be fully compatible with the imposition of Armenian as the spoken language, just as Turkish was later imposed throughout Anatolia. This is not the occasion to enter into the thorny arguments of language versus race. Suffice it to say that the Indo-European legacy to the modern Armenians is essentially linguistic. Perhaps it was inevitable that a very recent book attempting to present a new interpretation of Indo-European origins, employing both archaeological and palaeolinguistic approaches, should find itself, with its author, the center of much of the debate at Bellagio.43 Had this book not appeared after the Bellagio symposium had been announced, one might have been forgiven for seeing an intended connection between the two! The conclusions set out in Colin Renfrew's Archaeology and Language: the Puzzle o f Indo-European Origins found enthusiastic support from the leading proponent of a Proto-Indo-European homeland somewhat further to the east from that proposed by Renfrew, namely, in eastern Anatolia or just to the south, in north Syria-Mesopotamia.44 This contributor to the Bellagio symposium found himself the one representative Near Eastern archaeologist, and as such unable to accept many of Renfrew's or Gamkrelidze's suggestions. Models for prehistoric societies or maps for the geographical distribution of proto-languages have their uses, but only within the discipline imposed by the available evidence.

LANGUAGE CONTACTS IN THE CAUCASUS AND THE NEAR EAST
by Igor M. Diakonoff (Oriental Institute, Leningrad, USSR)
I confess I do not quite understand the title of the symposium: "When Worlds Collide." Webster's Dictionary explains "collide" as "to strike or dash against each other, to meet in shock; to meet in opposition or antagonism;" and the Oxford Dictionary explains "collision" as "violent encounter of moving body with another or with fixed object." A collision of worlds one envisages as an Armageddon of huge clashing armed forces. However, I do not believe in collision of worlds in the primitive and ancient societies (what kind of worlds? Ethnic? Cultural? Linguistic?). Alexander's Graeco-Macedonian army traversed the Ancient Oriental world, but the Greek and Oriental worlds did not clash; Alexander's conquest was followed by a slow and peaceful process of Occidental - Oriental contacts. An Attila, a Jenghiz Khan, a Hitler all belong to typologically later periods. If we are to speak of ancient mankind, a more suitable title would have been "When Worlds Come into Contact." Appropriately, I have been requested to read a paper on "Language Contacts in the Caucasus and the Near East." But language contact occurs always as the result of extralinguistic factors; therefore, if we are to study the meaning of language contact, we must also understand the historical, cultural and anthropological contacts which may be involved. Ethnic contacts are of different kinds, e.g.: (1) Total annihilation of the local inhabitants by an invading ethnic entity. To make such an event possible, both the level of development and the numbers of the contacting populations must be quite incommensurable. Obviously, such an event cannot occur in a world still living under archaic conditions. (2) Total displacement of the local inhabitants to another territory by the immigrating ethnic entity. Such an event is also less than probable in an archaic world



54 When Worlds Collide
and, besides, to achieve such a displacement, one has to have at disposal sufficient extra space to which the weaker ethnic group could be displaced. (3) Partial infiltration of a new ethnic entity, while the old one continues in residence in the same territory. This, as I think, was the typical case during the epoch of ancient mankind. The local population could either absorb the newcomers also linguistically, or it could adopt their language; whether the one or the other event occurred, depends on strictly definable historical circumstances. The biological features of the population, in any case, change but very slightly. I should like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the very frequent misuse of the migration hypothesis. One is apt to explain by population change any, or at least any major change in the pottery which is diagnostic of an archaeological culture; too little weight is sometimes ascribed to inner development and to spontaneous changes in technology as well as in fashions. But as I have just stated, a total population change practically never occurred in antiquity, and even partial population change should not be hypothesized without very good grounds. But it is exactly major population movements, viz. migrations of tribes and peoples in a body over thousands and thousands of miles, that have been commonly assumed as the reason for the spread of linguistic families. Such migrations have been imagined on the pattern and scale of the Great Migration of Peoples during the early Middle Ages, or of the invasion of Turko-Mongol tribes toward the West in the early second millennium A.D. The analogy, however, does not hold water. Thus, neither the early Indo-Europeans nor the early Semites were nomads (the latter fact having been established by the work of Pelio Fronzaroli). Stock rearing was important to both, but their economy can by no means be compared to that of the early Turko-Mongols. As to the Great Migration of the early Middle Ages, it did not bring about a biological and linguistic change in the Western European population, with the only exception of England.** In the nineteenth and twentieth century it was mainly the linguists who dealt in migrations, but it should be obvious that a migration is primarily a problem for the historian. In order to postulate that a migration has taken place, one has to answer a number of questions that are essentially historical, as follows. First question: What was the reason of and the impulse to the migration? To my knowledge, there have been, in the Ancient World, only two reasons for mass migration: (a) catastrophic drought on a major scale; in the Mediterranean region such was the case in the sixth-fifth millennium B.C., when the proto-civilization of Catalhuyuketc. was brought to an end, and in the late third-early second millennium B.C., when contacts were apparently lost between the Fertile Crescent and south Arabia; and (b), a dramatic growth in food production leading to a fall in child mortality and a rise in the population increase above the usual much less than 1% per annum. A migration is induced by a relative scarcity of land resources. This applies to the agricultural and agricultural-cum-stock raising tribes at the period of the Neolithic "revolution," and, in a quite different context, to the period of the Great Greek Colonization. The spread of the Indo-European speaking tribes - I would not use the term migration - was apparently due to the rise in the production of vegetables, milk and meat under the favorable conditions of the deciduous Eastern European forests in the moist fourth and third millennia B.C.



Second question, or, better, the second group of questions: Did the migration involve the whole population or only the males (the latter was the case of the CimmeroScythian migrations)? Did one walk on foot or did one use some means of transportation, and if the latter case is assumed, what were the means? Were they actually available? Let me cite an example. In one of the latest variants of their theory of IndoEuropean migrations, Vyacheslav Ivanov and Thomas Gamkrelidze suggest that the Indo-Iranians, whose supposed Ur-Heimat was in Iranian Azerbaijan, passed to Middle Asia by ships over the Caspian. However shipping on the Caspian is not attested until very much later, and necessary timber is nowhere available along the coast, except for the inaccessible subtropical forests of Talish and Mazanderan, out of the way of any possible major migration. The mountain passes across the Greater Caucasus although accessible to groups of pedestrians, or of riders without women (like the Cimmerians and the Alani), were not suited for crossing in wagons on primitive wheels, with families and household goods. Third group o f questions: What kind of population did one meet in the path of the migration? What happened to that population? Was it massacred? Was it ousted? Was it assimilated? Or, perhaps, did it itself assimilate the newcomers, culturally and biologically, although adopting the language of the newcomers? Unless these questions can be satisfactorily answered, I should refuse to discuss any tribal or popular migration en masse. What actually happens in history, can be illustrated by a linguistic 'migration' which occurred in historical times, namely, the spread of the Turkic languages. The late eminent Russian anthropologist L.V. Oshanin studied the stability of certain genes in the different Turkic speaking populations. It is well known that in a biologically stable population the recessive and the dominant genes will be maintained in the same proportion. The first historically attested Turkic tribes were anthropologically Mongoloid and hence had the typical Mongoloid feature of the epicanthic fold of the eyelid, depending upon a dominant gene. If the movement of the Turkic languages from the borders of modem China to those of modern Turkey were actually a mass population movement, then the percentage of the epicanthus in the speakers of Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Uzbek, Kazakh and Qyrghyz would be approximately identical. The actual measurements, however, show the retention percentage of epicanthic fold to be, in males, 51% for the Qyrghyz, 22% for the Kazakhs, 11% for the Uzbeks, 6% for the Turkmens, and below 2% for the Azerbaijanis; and in females, 83% for the Qyrghyz, 53% for the Kazakhs, 18% for the Uzbeks, and 10% for the Turkmens. For Turks, the retention percentage for both sexes tends toward zero. This means, of course, that the Turkic language was adopted each time by a certain local population from the newcomers, and was then passed on to the next population; intermarriage of the local and immigrating population, and inclusion of local tribes in the general nomadic ethnic entity, also played their role. The farther West the wave of migration passed, the less it included individuals who were bearers of the original genes. Moreover, Oshanin could show that the modern Turkic-speaking Turkmens, - as far as biological features were concerned, and discounting the above mentioned 10% of gene retention, - differed in no way from the Scythian (Iranian) speaking Massagetae who lived in Turkmenia 25 centuries earlier.

56 When Worlds Collide
The same must be true of the spread of Indo-European languages, especially if we take into account the fact that, as distinct from the Turks, the Indo-European speakers were not nomads. This 'relay-race' type spread of languages and linguistic families must be regarded as typical: catastrophic invasions with complete change of population being rather unusual in history. It is only by the 'relay-race* type spread of languages that we can explain why the blond Norwegian or Lithuanian speaks an Indo-European language just as do the very black-skinned Singhalese of Sri Lanka. We can safely relegate to the realm of myth the masses of Indo-Iranians crossing the Caspian in ships from Iranian Azerbaijan to Turkmenia, or, for that matter, any simultaneous mass emigration of an entire Indo-European speaking population from one country to another. The same is true of any other agricultural tribe: a peasant does not leave his land unless driven by dire necessity. It is my considered opinion that the Indo-European language speakers never left their homeland, wherever it may have lain. What happened, was the constant spread of an increasing population to neighbouring peripheral territories, where the aborigines were usually less numerous and often were on a lower level of production culture; the new settlers intermarried and intermixed with the locals, a common culture and a common (Indo-European) language arose, and was spread by the same procedure further onward. Another misconception must also be touched upon. This is the misconception of a Herrenvolk forcing its language upon a conquered population. This is something which cannot be substantiated historically. None of the ancient empires forced their language upon the conquered people. The Near East emerged after its conquest by the Assyrian and later the Babylonian empire linguistically united, but the common language was not Akkadian of the conquerors but the Aramaic, and from the dominion of Urartu Eastern Anatolia emerged Armenian speaking; the common language of all peoples in the eastern part of the Roman Empire became Greek, not Latin; and even if 'Vulgar Latin' became the language of the western part of the Empire, it was not because the Roman conquerors forced their language upon the aboriginals, but because participation in the Roman culture was a desired material asset. The same is true of Arabic: Arabic was acquired with Islam and the Islamic culture; the Arab masters taxed their subjects higher if they did not embrace Islam but they never did force Arabic upon Christians, Sabians, or Jews. Note that the number of Arabs who entered Egypt in the 7th century was merely about 12,000, but this did not prevent the Egyptians adopting, with time, the Arabic language while retaining their anthropological type and, to a great extent, their way of life. A language may spread without appreciable population movement. Thus during the twentieth century the borders of Uzbek speaking territory have constantly spread at the expense of Tajik speaking territory. The reason for the spread of a language may be different: As for instance, the need for wider communications, especially in a multilanguage environment, or at a period of more intensive trade relations in a specific territory; sometimes merely the fact that a language was easy to learn decided which language was to get predominance (as Aramaic in the Near East, or Turkic in Middle East Asia).



Diakonoff 57
However, as a general rule we may state that at least a minority of speakers of the new language must arrive in the new territory, in order that a new language should spread to it. Such an infiltration, however, does not necessarily leave any important traces in the racial features, in the archaeology of the region, nor even in official texts which may continue to be couched in the traditional official language (Akkadian, Urartian, Hieroglyphic Luwian, etc.); only catastrophic invasions leave clear archaeological traces, but such invasions, as mentioned above, were not frequent. A slower movement and longer periods of settlement can be traced through onomastics, toponyms and hydronyms. Language territory cannot in principle be unreservedly identified with the territory of one certain archaeological culture. Especially in the archaic periods, with little communication between tribes, different archaeological cultures can form within one dialect continuum. Such cultures would not perhaps be quite dissimilar. Language being the most important medium for the transfer of cultural features, it stands to reason that inside one major archaeological culture we should expect one language or at least one dialect continuum. However, let us remember that Akkadian and Sumerian cannot, in the absence of written sources, be sorted out from archaeological sources alone; and the same is true of the Hurrians and Semites of Upper Mesopotamia in the second millennium B.C. Thus, the existence, at a certain time and in a certain territory, of a major more or less homogenous archaeological culture may be an approximate indication of a continuum of interrelated dialects, but is not a sure proof of its existence. Now I turn to how I envisage the spread of the Indo-European dialects in antiquity. This is only a subjective opinion: one has to make hypothetic constructions when one thinks, but it is not something I should stake my head on. The triumphant spread of the Indo-European languages over most of the Eurasian continent is due, no doubt, to the fact that their original speakers had a more viable economy than their neighbours, with relatively low infant mortality. This must have been an economy based on high grade agriculture and animal breeding, which supplied milk and meat food for the population in relative plenty. Let us recall that the mass of Sumerians and Akkadians had no meat or milk in their daily diet. For me, that means that the Indo-European speakers must have been the descendants of the first agriculturists and cattle-breeders in Europe. Were it otherwise, it would be another language which would spread all over these great spaces. This, for me, points to the Balkans and the Danube basin as the original home of the Indo-Europeans; only later some of them must have moved into the region between the Elba and the Vistula. It seems established that grain cultivation and cattle breeding reached Macedonia and Thrace from Asia Minor at some moment in the seventh millennium B.C. It is the palaeobotanists and palaeo-zoologists who have the word here; but if this is actually the case, then the Catal-huyuk proto-urban farmer culture of the eighthseventh millennia B.C. in Asia Minor might have been the homeland of pre-Proto-IndoEuropeans et al. This, of course, is no more than a guess with no necessary validity. The Catal-huyuk culture perished by the sixth millennium with the beginning of a prolonged drought period. Only in one case is the identification of an Indo-European group with a certain archaeological culture possible with nearly complete probability: The Srubnaya, a



58 When Worlds Collide
Bronze culture in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of Russia and the Ukraine (second half of the second millennium B.C. - early first millennium), as well as its neighboring and kindred Andronovo culture extending from Southern Siberia to the borders of Iran and Afghanistan. These archaeological cultures can confidently be regarded as Indo-Iranian or, more probably, North-Eastern Iranian. The other archaeological cultures of Eastern Europe between the late fourth millennium and the early first millennium have been variously identified with different early Indo-European speakers. The identification perhaps most popular in the West is that of Marija Gimbutas; it is not so popular in my country, because our archaeologists feel she is not quite au courant with the newer Soviet finds. There is a number of other identifications; I shall, at random, stake upon the unpublished identification of a young Ukrainian scholar, Stanislav Kaira; it is quite plausible and in no way inferior to any other suggested identification, and may give a representative view of how the problem stands. According to Kaira, the Yamnaya, or Kurgan culture of the fourth - early second millennia B.C., situated between the Dniester and the Urals, represents mainly the ancestors of the languages of the eastern Indo-Europeans (Greeks, Phrygians, Thracians, Armenians, and Indo-Iranians); to the North-East of it, the Afanasievo culture represents the Tocharians; the Usatovo, the Middle Dnieper culture, as well as the Schnur-Keramik and related cultures of Eastern Europe represent the Balto-Slavic, Germanic, Celtic, and Italic speaking tribes. Also Ivanov and Gamkrelidze reconstruct the habitat of the early IndoEuropeans more or less in the same way, the difference, however, is that they bring them into Eastern Europe from Eastern Anatolia and Iranian Azerbaijan, and that by different devious routes, and in such a way that linguistically closely related languages are assigned different routes, while linguistically remote languages are supposed to have followed one and the same route. A long sojourn of speakers of a certain language in a given territory means usually that (a) one can approximately identify a certain archaeological culture as created by the speakers of that language, alone or jointly with other ethnic groups; (b) one can identify substratum words borrowed from the language in question into the later language or languages of that area; (c) one can identify toponyms or hydronyms borrowed from the same substratum language; (d) the way of migration can approximately be traced by migration of archaeological artifacts which have a diagnostic value for the archaeological culture in question. On the strength of these indicators, one can confidently say that Indo-European languages have not been spoken in the Near East before the arrival of the Hittito-Luwians (probably in the third millennium B.C.), the Proto-Armenians (late in the second millennium B.C.)^, and the IndoIranians (probably during the second millennium B.C.). Ivanov and Gamkrelidze themselves concede that their hypothetic Indo-Europeans in Eastern Anatolia and Iranian Azerbaijan cannot be identified with any particular archaeological culture, and the tentative identifications with the Tell-Halaf and the Shulaveri-Shomutepe cultures (the latter in Transcaucasia) are by no means convincing. There are no toponyms or hydronyms of early Indo-European origin in Eastern Anatolia; as to the hydronyms quoted by Ivanov and Gamkrelidze for the peninsula of Asia Minor, I cannot see why they could not be early Hittito-Luwian. As to words borrowed from Proto-Indo



Diakonoff 59
European into Near Eastern languages, the authors quote I.-E. *woi-no- 'wine' and Semitic *wain- do., Kartvelian * wino- do. and also Georgian venaq- 'vineyard' allegedly from an I.-E. *weinag- (p. 881); but on p. 649 the same I.-E. gloss dwindles down to a late Southern Slavic word-compound vinyaga 'wine-berry,' i.e. 'grape' which cannot by any stretch of imagination be responsible for Georgian venaq-. However, *wain- is only Western Semitic, not Common Semitic or Common Afrasian, and hence may have been borrowed from Mycenean Greek; actual Indo-European-Kartvelian isoglosses will be mentioned below. Furthermore, the authors cite Hattie aia- 'to give' as an allegedly I.-E. borrowing. Since the word belongs to the main semantic nucleus to which foreign words are very seldom borrowed, I prefer to regard the Hattie word as Sirene des Gleichklangs, and the same is true of Hattie urai 'well, spring’ and Uret 'goddess of water and springs,' allegedly from Indo-European. Also quite improbable is the suggestion that Elamite borrowed from ProtoIndo-European its anaphoric pronouns and some other words which are, with one or two exceptions, misquotations anyway. Elamite has now been safely classed together with Dravidian by McAlpin, and also the words in question have received satisfactory native etymologies. This is also true of Hurro-Urartian ag- 'to lead,' and ass- 'to be placed, to sit;' both have good Eastern Caucasian etymologies and need not be regarded as borrowings. Moreover, the verb ass-, being Common Hurro-Urartian, i.e. dating back to about the fourth millennium B.C., cannot be borrowed from Indo-Iranian; and if borrowed from Common Indo-European, it would have been represented as *es-, not ass-\ Urartian burgana means 'pole,' not 'fortress,' and has a satisfactory Eastern Caucasian etymology. Hurrian kade 'barley1represents the phoneme k, not *c[ (spelled к or h) and cannot be identified with I.-E. *Hat-, etc., etc. Ivanov and Gamkrelidze cite also a number of glosses which allegedly are borrowed from Semitic into Proto-Indo-European. I have already analyzed these glosses elsewhere and shown that they ( ) do not satisfy the necessary phonetic and/or semantic requirements; in a few cases they may be wandering Kulturworter having reached some Indo-European areas but certainly not Common Indo-European. Still less reliable are the alleged borrowings into Common Indo-European from Sumerian, like Indo-European *gwou- (or, according to the authors, even *k'ou ’cow1) from Sumerian *gud 'cattle; bull' and simultaneously from Egyptian ng\w, i.e. [*naga'-w], to quote only one example out of she quite impossible etymologies. Then we come to the question whether there exist archaeological traces of any mass movement from Anatolia and Azerbaijan towards the East and North-East towards India, Central Asia and Southern Siberia, and thence to Eastern Europe (the Yamnaya, or Kurgan Culture). Such a movement is postulated by Ivanov and Gamkrelidze. Space does not allow me to dwell upon this point in more detail; it is sufficient to state that no such traces going back to the fourth-second millennia B.C. are at all attested; on the contrary, all evidence points to popular movements in the opposite direction, i.e. from Eastern Europe towards the East, from Southern Siberia towards the South, etc., etc. We must unavoidably come to the conclusion that the Proto-Indo-Europeans did never dwell in Eastern Anatolia and Iranian Azerbaijan, nor anywhere else in the Near East, at least not in the fifth to third millennia B.C.



60 When Worlds Collide
Now we can turn to the positive evidence that we have at our disposal concerning the linguistic areas in the Ancient Near East. The oldest linguistic area is that of the so-called 'Banana'-language, also known as Proto-Tigridian. It appears in a few late third millennium B.C. personal names from Gasur at the site of Yorghan-tepe near Kirkuk in Eastern Iraq, east of the Tigris, and in a number of borrowed cultural words in Sumerian, like urudu 'metal, copper,' apin 'plough,' and others, as well as in a number of names of deities, like Inana, Ishkhara, Kubaba, Zababa, Aia, Bunene, Igigi and others. The language was certainly extinct by 2000 B.C.; its kinship connections are unknown. Next comes Sumerian. The Sumerian language seems to have been brought to Southern Mesopotamia presumably in the early fourth millennium B.C., and apparently from the East. The pronunciation of Sumerian words is known only from Akkadian transcriptions in Sumero-Akkadian vocabularies and in Sumerian borrowings into Akkadian. However - as I think I was able to prove (work in print) - the current pronunciation of Akkadian is the result of uncritical transposition to it of Hebrew and partly Arabic pronunciations of the Common Semitic phonemes, and the real phonetics of Akkadian was very far from the conventional. This means that also the Akkadian transcriptions of Sumerian words are, as of today, practically worthless until deeper investigations have been made. It is fairly certain that the Sumerian phonetic system was very complicated, reminding one of, e.g., Eastern Caucasian. No kinship connection between Sumerian and any other language in the world has been established. The Sumerians lived in modern Southern Iraq in a peaceful cohabitation with the Eastern Semites, or Akkadians. No archaeological traces of ethnical conflicts in Southern Mesopotamia between the years 4000 B.C. and 2000 B.C. have been observed, although local wars were of course waged, but regardless of the language spoken by the adversaries. Both peoples shared the common denomination of 'blackheads’ (Sumerian sang-ngiga, Akkadian salmat qaqqadi). The whole population of Southern Mesopotamia, after a prolonged period of bilingualism, changed over to Akkadian at a date which has been variously estimated, from ca. 2500 B.C. to ca. 1500 B.C. The Semites form a linguistic family inside the Afrasian, or Afro-Asiatic linguistic phylum. The Semites were living in Western Asia south of the Asianic and the Armenian Taurus and west of the Zagros, in a territory probably including the Arabian Peninsula, at least since the fourth or even the fifth millennium B.C. The analysis of the Common Semitic vocabulary by Pelio Fronzaroli has shown that the Proto-Semites were neolithic and chalcolithic agriculturalists and animal breeders. Since it has been proved that Semitic is related to the African linguistic families Egyptian, Cushitic (and probably Omotic), Berbero-Libyan and Chadic, the question of the original homeland of the whole phylum arises. I had suggested the eastern part of the Republic of Sudan and Western Sahara, but weighty arguments have been brought against this hypothesis. Another such hypothesis is that of Alexander Militarev. According to him, the Proto-Afrasians were very early agriculturalists acquainted with certain metals and living in an environment of half desert and steppe, half Mediterranean maquis and forest-land. On glottochronological grounds he dates Proto-Afrasian to ca. ten-eleven thousand B.C. and identifies their original habitat with the area of the Natufian mesolithic culture in Palestine. The Natufians, however, had



still no agriculture, and the economic picture drawn by Militarev's proto-language reconstruction points rather to the seventh or eighth, not the eleventh millennium B.C. According to Militarev, the speakers of the 'African' Afrasian languages left Western Asia dining the sixth millennium period of drought and passed to Africa partly via Suez, and partly via the Bab al-Mandab. In both cases the groups of migrants could not have been very numerous, although their languages were to be adopted by a great number of people - of the Ethiopian local black race (the Cushites), the Negroid local black race (the Chadians), the Mediterranean local white race (the Egyptians) and the AtlantoBaltic local white race (the Berbero-Lybians and the Guanche in the Canarians). As an argument in favor of a Western Asiatic origin of all Afrasian speakers Militarev adduces the existence of Berber - East-Caucasian, and Cushitic - West Caucasian specific isoglosses; whether or not the isoglosses in question are of better quality than that postulated by Ivanov and Gamkrelidze for Proto-Indo-Europeans and the languages of Ancient Near East, remains to be seen. The Elamites, inhabiting the whole southern part of present-day Iran during the third and second millennia B.C. - probably also earlier - seem to be linguistically akin to the Brahui in modern Baluchistan (Afghanistan and Pakistan) and further with the Dravidians of Southern India. The Elamite - and the possibly related Kassite language - gradually gave way during the later second and the first millennia B.C. to the speakers of Western Iranian languages of the Indo-European linguistic family. No archaeological evidence of ethnic conflicts exists. The next linguistic family to be considered is the Northern Caucasian. Formerly Caucasian was divided into three branches: North-Western with Abkhazian, Adygh, Ubykh, etc., Southern or Kartvelian with Svan, Georgian, Mingrelian and Ch'an and North-Eastern with Chechen, Avaro-Andian, Lezghian etc. After the work done by S A . Starostin and S A . Nikolaev it appears evident that North-Caucasian is a superfamily divided into two families, the North-Eastern (or Eastern Caucasian), and the North-Western (or Western Caucasian); while Kartvelian does not belong to the Caucasian superfamily at all but constitutes a separate family of its own. The typology of Proto-Kartvelian word structure is strikingly similar to that of Proto-Indo-European. There exist also a number of Proto-Kartvelian - Proto-Indo-European lexical isoglosses. What is especially important, they do not belong to the cultural vocabulary so often easily borrowed, but to the nuclear vocabulary, as e.g. *dew-: *dw- 'to lie, to put;' *lag-: *lg- 'to lay, to plant;' *gen-\ *gn- 'to understand, to hear,' *zisxl 'blood,' *m-k'erd 'breast' *k’rep- 'to pluck, to gather (fruit),' *brg 'strong, sturdy, large' and a number of others which an Indo-European scholar will immediately recognize. Therefore, in spite of the fact that such eminent experts as G A . Klimov and Th.V. Gamkrelidze regard these isoglosses as borrowings, I am inclined to regard them as evidence of a collateral kinship between Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Kartvelian going back to a common Proto-Kartvelo-Indo-European dialect continuum. The Georgians themselves, including the Georgian linguists, regard their language as autochtonous. The whole Ivanov-Gamkrelidze theory shows a picture of Indo-European languages moving in a gigantic rotating movement with immovable Georgian as the axis of the giant wheel. But note that also the Armenians and even the Azerbaijanis tend to regard their mother tongue as autochtonous and immovable since early antiquity. If the Georgian language has never budged from its place in Eastern

and Central Transcaucasia, then it is truly unique in the world. I think it more probable that the first speakers of Kartvelian arrived from outside, and namely (since no connection between Catal-Huyuk in early Asia Minor and the later archaeological cultures of Georgia can be traced), from the North. As a probable archaeological nucleus one might regard the Maikop culture of the North Caucasus, and the newly found tumuli in Kakhetia, Georgia. The date of the Maikop culture (second half of the third millennium B.C.) fits the glottochronology of Kartvelian. Although formerly the Maikop culture was regarded as isolated, now it can be regarded as having certain features in common not only with the Near Eastern cultures, but also with the PreProto-European cultures of the third millennium B.C. in Southern Europe (Megalithic and others). The Northwest-Caucasian dolmens do not differ from the European Megalithic ones. The speakers of Northern Caucasian languages inhabit at present a very limited mountain zone in the Greater Caucasus and belong to a specific local European race - the Caucasionic one (also the Ossetes whose language is the descendant of the Scythian dialect of the Alani, i.e. North-Eastern Iranian, - belong to the same local race). However, some time ago, conjointly with S A . Starostin, I seem to have proved that also Hurro-Urartian belonged to the Eastern Caucasian linguistic family, having its place between Chechen, Andian and Lezghian. This does not tell the non-expert very much. But if you put a compass leg, on a map of the Causacus, in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, then in about a hundred miles due NE you will find the Kodori pass leading into Chechnia; just west of the Kodori pass are the sources of the Andian-Koisu river, whose valley North of the Greater Caucasus is inhabited by the Andians; and the different Lezghian tribes live on both sides of the Greater Caucasus, south of a line due East of Tbilisi. Supposing the Proto-Chechen, the Proto-Andian and the ProtoLezghian languages were spoken in about the same region some five or six thousand years ago, this means that the homeland of the Hurro-Urartians would be to the South of the Chechens and the Andians and to the West of the Lezghians, somewhere between modern Tbilisi and the mountains to the east of it. Of course, the suggested homeland may have lain also farther to the northeast, or the southeast, or the southwest. According to Starostin, the Caucasian languages are related to the Ket on the Yenissey River and to Sino-Tibetan. This seems to be a rather mad statement, but coming from a linguist of the stature of Starostin, cannot be just disregarded. Anyway, it is not improbable that the Caucasian languages, like the other language groups in the region, have been imported from the North or North-East at an early date. They do not belong to the Nostratic phylum (with Indo-European, Kartvelian, Fenno-Ugrian and Elamo-Dravidian). The glottochronological date for Proto-Caucasian is well beyond the 4000 B.C. mark, perhaps 5000 B.C. Margarita Khachikyan in Erevan has shown that the infiltration of the Hurrian speakers to the foothills and the plains of the Near East went on in several discrete waves during the late third and the first half of the second millennium B.C., coming apparently from the North-East (hurri-le seems to have meant 'Easterners' or 'NorthEasterners', c.f. Hurrian hum 'morning'). The northern limit of Hurrian is unknown, but it certainly lay far up in eastern Anatolia or even in Transcaucasia. The western limit of the Hurrian language area lay certainly West of the Taurus, the eastern



somewhere in the Zagros. The homeland of the Urartian was, in the late second and early first millennia B.C., around Lake Van and east of it in Eastern Anatolia. It is perhaps unavoidable to regard Eastern Anatolia (and Transcaucasia?) as the region of the Hurro-Urartian language before its descent to the foothills and into the plains, i.e., in the third millennium B.C. There is good reason to believe that in the third millennium B.C. the Hurro-Urartian language zone more or less coincided with the area of the Eastern Anatolian Early Bronze culture. The Soviet archaeologists call it the Kur-Araxes culture: its center is thought to have lain in Transcaucasia, and its northern frontier crossed the Greater Caucasus at Kodori and farther to the East. This actually leaves no space here for the Indo-Europeans. Also Iranian Azerbaijan was inhabited at that time (and later) by a people called the Qutians. The term *quti coincides with the name of the little modern Lezghian people Udi (< *qut i) living on the frontier between Georgia and Azerbaijan. We know very little about the Qutian language, but most probably it also was Eastern Caucasian. Caucasian languages (in the proper sense, i.e. not including the Kartvelian) seem also to have been the substratum for Hittito-Luwian. This is fairly certain for the Hittites (and the Palaians of Paphlagonia). Here the substratum was Hattie which, after the recent work of I.M. Dunajevskaja, V.G. Ardzimba and V.V. Ivanov, we can fairly certainly consider as a Western Caucasian language. The certainty is perhaps not so cast-iron as in the case of the eastern Caucasian origin of Hurro-Urartian, but the evidence is not to be discarded, and anyway, even a priori Hattie could hardly be anything else but Western Caucasian. But the Hattie linguistic area did not stretch beyond the Halys (Kizil-Irmak), and the substratum of the Luwians and the rest of Asia Minor, including Cyprus, Lemnos etc., - was apparently Eastern Caucasian. At the time of working with Starostin on Hurro-Urartian I had a look through the Etruscan material. I was struck by the typological similarity between the Etruscan and the Hurrian grammar structures; it was obvious that the Etruscologists were so long unable to solve the riddle of the Etruscan grammar because they were hampered by their Indo-European background. This fall Starostin and his collaborator V.E. Orel read a paper postulating a material kinship between Etruscan and the Hurro-Urartian branch of the Eastern Caucasian linguistic family, both in vocabulary and in morphology. In their opinion the Etruscan language was one of the languages of the aboriginal population of Asia Minor, its speakers having emigrated to the Central Mediterranean long before the Peoples of the Sea movement in the late second millennium B.C. While we are speaking about Eastern Caucasian, and Hurrian in particular, it would be appropriate to touch upon the problem of the so-called "Mesopotamian Aryan." Ivanov and Gamkrelidze greatly overrate the value of the existing evidence on "Mesopotamian Aryan;" they even suggest that the Indo-Iranians dwelled in Iranian Azerbaijan as early as the fourth-third millennium. As proof they bring the supposed kinship of Sumerian si-si 'horse' with the Indo-Iranian name of the horse in its sat3mform (asva- < *ek'uo-). I just cannot believe in the existence of saUm-forms already in the Ur-Heimat, allegedly in Anatolia - Azerbaijan; and anyway the connection of si-si even to asva- (not *ek'uo-) is a Sirene des Gleichklangs, if ever there was one.
According to the common opinion, there are Indo-Aryan (allegedly "Mesopotamian Aryan") glosses in the handbook of horse-training written by one
Diakonoff



64 When Worlds Collide
Mitannian Kikkuli for the Hittite kings in about the thirteenth century B.C., and there is a list of Indo-Aryan gods: Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and the Nasatyas, invoked as guarantors of a treaty between the Hittite king Suppiluliumas I and the Mitannian pretender Shattiwazza. It has been pointed out as important in this connection that Mitra is a god of treaties. As to Kikkuli's handbook, the above is substantially correct; whether the glosses are actually Indo-Aryan is, as we shall see, a moot question. As to the HittiteMitannian treaty, the statement in the form cited is wrong, as very justly pointed out by Annelies Kammenhuber. She also noted that all extant 'Aryan' glosses in second millennium cuneiform texts are not actually Aryan but manifestly transmitted by Hurrian speakers. The list of deities in the treaty is very long indeed, and the so-called 'Aryan' gods are enumerated very far down the list (the deities being listed according to their importance, and the list including Hattie, Hittito-Luwian, Sumero-Akkadian and Hurrian gods). The 'Aryan' gods are not listed on a par with the others: their names are included in a Hurrian quotation, as follows: Mitra-ssi-l urwa-na-ssi-l Ind(a)ra Nasatya-nna, which means: 'those of the belonging to Mitra, those of the belonging to the urwa's, Indra, (and) the Nasatya's." The variant of the treaty has aru-na-ssi-l for urwa-na-ssi-l. The place of Mitra far down the long list points to the fact that his function as treaty-god was in this case quite unimportant, and as to urwa-na (aru-na), it can by no means be a transcription of Varuna, because Hurrian does not know a development of an initial w- to zero (neither does Hittite). Urwa-na is probably the Hurrian plural of the Indo-Iranian mythological term urwan ’soul' (preserved in Old Iranian), and Mitra-ssi-l urwa-na-ssi-l means 'Those of the belonging to Mitra, those of the belonging to (the dead) souls', Mitra appearing here in his quality of the deity of light as opposed to the dead, or, contrariwise, as judge of the dead. Now urwa- cannot be Indo-Aryan, while other glosses, especially aika 'one,' seem to point rather to Indo-Aryan than to Iranian. The 'Prakrit' form satta for 'seven' is, however, unexpected. There certainly never was an Aryan language spoken in Mesopotamia. The Mitannian Hurrians belonged to the last wave of Hurrian immigration according to Margaret Khachikyan, coming apparently from modern Iranian Azerbaijan about 1700 B.C. The kingdom was officially called Hanigalbat; Mittanni < *Maitani being apparently the dynastic name; the same name had been preserved as a territorial designation in the first millennium B.C., when the country near lake Urmia in Iranian Azerbaijan was called Matiane. The dynasty was apparently Matianian and originally but no longer in Mesopotamia - Indo-Iranian-speaking. The Kingdom Hanigalbat itself was Hurrian. Note that the mananna-charioteers were not an aristocracy and were exclusively recruited from Hurrians, as follows from hundreds of documents. The term has a satisfactory Eastern Caucasian etymology. However 1700 B.C. is too early for Iranians, and Iranian Azerbaijan is too far West for the Indians. But one is apt to forget that there are three, not two sub branches in the Indo-Iranian linguistic branch: it was divided into Kafirs, Indo-Aryans and Iranians, and the Kafirs were, according to the authority of Georg Morgenstierne, the first to move south from Middle Asia. Note that Avestan, spoken originally on the main road from Middle Asia to the South, namely in the Marw-rud and Tejen-Harirud



Diakonoff 65
valleys, has no non-Indo-Iranian linguistic substratum, and thus must have overlaid another Indo-Iranian language. This, not improbably, could have been the Kafir; later pushed up into the mountains, the Kafirs could have preceded the Iranians on a much greater area, even including Matiane in Azerbaijan (but not Mesopotamia). The glosses aika, satta, etc. fit Kafir perfectly, Indra was the chief god of the Kafirs until the beginning of this century, the other great god of the Kafirs, Imro, united in himself the images of Mitra and Yama, the god of the dead. There is no more space for description of other ancient Near Eastern linguistic contacts in this paper; but since my books referring to Phrygian and Armenian5 have just appeared in the States I think I can refer the readers to them. One last point: there is a number of Hurro-Urartian substratum words in Armenian, referring to the local plants, animals, and to social institutions in Eastern Anatolia during the first millennium B.C.; also the dramatic change from Proto-Indo-European to Armenian morphology is easily explained by the influence of an Urartian substratum with a fixed stress on the penultimate syllable^. But there is no Armenian substratum in either Hattie, Hittite, Hurrian, or Urartian.

KARTVELIAN CONTACTS WITH INDO-EUROPEAN1
ALICE C. HARRIS
Vanderbilt University
In their work on the Indo-European language family (Indoevropejskij jazyk i
indoevropejcy, vol. I, 1984), Gamkrelidze and Ivanov have presented arguments for
intense contact between the Indo-Europeans and the Kartvelians as early as the
fourth or third m illenium B.C. This hypothesis has im plications for the
Indo-European homeland and is an important part of their proposal for locating it
in Anatolia. They suggest three types of parallel between Indo-European and
Kartvelian: (i) phonological parallels, some of them studied by Gamkrelidze and
Machavariani 1965 and reiterated in the more recent work, (ii) syntactic parallels,
and (iii) lexical borrowings, set out in the more recent work. The purpose of the
present paper is to call attention to some additional facts that need to be taken
into account in assessing proposed parallels between Indo-European and
Kartvelian, with emphasis on the morphological and syntactic systems of the
languages.
In section 1 below, I address some issues concerning the nature of linguistic
diffusion and the methods involved in its investigation and assessment. The second
section focuses on the proposed syntactic parallels, and the third on some of the
proposed phonological(-morphological) parallels. The final section provides an
evaluation of proposed linguistic parallels between Indo-European and Kartvelian
and their implications for the question of the Indo-European homeland.

Campbell, John Greppin, and Brent Vine for comments on earlier drafts.



68 When Worlds Collide
1. The Investigation o f Areal Linguistics
The kind o f intense, prolonged contact that has been suggested for
Indo-European and Kartvelian typically results in a number of shared linguistic
traits. In recent years linguists have learned a great deal about the nature o f
diffusion and the investigation and definition of a linguistic area or Sprachbund.
Some lin gu ists have considered a sin gle shared featu re the minimum for
establishing the existence of a Sprachbund (Masica 1976), while many others find a
linguistic area based on a set o f shared features more acceptable (see discussion in
Campbell 198S and Campbell, Kaufman, and Smith-Stark 1986).
In assessing proposed diagnostics of any Sprachbund, it is essential first to
distinguish diffused areal features from chance correspondence, from shared
genetic material, and from correlates of some other feature.
Once we have eliminated the reasonable possibility of a parallel resulting
from genetic affiliation or from another parallel, we must evaluate the particular
proposed feature from the point o f view o f ease o f diffusion. It is well accepted
that lexical borrowing is extremely easy and does not require intense contact.
D iffu sion o f lex ica l item s is expected in a linguistic area but alone is not
indicative o f one. Borrowing of structural features may be more d ifficult and,
other things being equal, may be indicative of more intense contact.
A further point essential in evaluating a proposed diagnostic of contact is just
how common that feature is among languages of the world. Clearly, a highly
unusual feature is more valuable as an indicator of contact, for it is less likely
that it could have developed independently in the languages concerned. To
illustrate the importance o f this principle, let us take an extreme example. Nasal
consonants are extrem ely common, being found in all languages o f the world apart
from a few American Indian languages spoken on the North West coast o f the
United States and perhaps some languages of New Guinea. Obviously, the presence
o f nasal consonants in two languages would not be a highly valued diagnostic of
contact. As a less extreme example, we might consider word order. The orders
VSO, SVO, and SOV are all very common among languages of the world, while



Harris 69
VOS, OVS, and OSV are more rare. While any one of the last three might be
indicative of contact, none of the first three would be a convincing diagnostic.
In well-understood linguistic areas, it is possible to show that some of the
members of the Sprachbund under consideration acquired the defining traits by
diffusion from remaining members. For example, some Indo-European languages
are part of the South Asian linguistic area, and the roots of these languages are
understood in relation to Indo-European languages spoken outside India. For this
reason, we can be reasonably clear about which features of the Indo-European
languages o f India underwent change as a result of -contact with Dravidian,
Munda, and other languages o f India. For example, it can be shown then that the
Indo-European languages in India first lacked retroflex consonants, then acquired
them over a period of time. Since the Munda and Dravidian languages (and others)
have this feature, the historical development of this feature in Indo-Aryan
language make it possible to infer that the acquisition was due to contact with
languages already having the feature. Hamp 1977, Jacobsen 1980, Campbell 1985,
and Campbell, Kaufman, and Smith-Stark 1986, have stressed the importance of
this historical dimension in establishing a linguistic area; following these authors, I
refer to this as the "historical" approach.
In the absence of this historical dimension, we are left with the problem of
evaluating the likelihood that the observed parallels developed independently in
the two families or that they are due to mere chance. Following the authors cited
in the prededing paragraph, I refer to this as the "circumstantial" approach. For
example, the North East Caucasian family and the North West Caucasian family
are in close geographical proximity and share the feature of ergative agreement
(defined below). However, it cannot be established that this is due to close contact.
We cannot establish that one family first lacked this feature then acquired it
through contact; we have only circumstantial evidence.
Any evidence that can relate Indo-European to Kartvelian in the fourth or
third millenium is necessarily circumstantial, in the sense that it goes well beyond
the possibilities of linguistic science to demonstrate that a particular feature first
was not to be found in one of these language families and later was present there.



70 When Worlds Collide
or to establish clearly how it got from one to the other. In part this is due to the
fact that there are no languages that are related but outside the Sprachbund to act
as the "control" case.
The fact that the origin of a structural characteristic can be explained on
internal grounds does not indicate that it was not diffused from other languages.
(This point has been made by Campbell 1985 and, regarding the Balkan linguistic
area, by Joseph 1983). The importance of multiple causation in language change is
now recognized. It is, in fact, unlikely that syntactic characteristics can diffuse in
the way words do, by simple wholesale borrowing. It seems more likely that in all
cases diffusion o f structural characteristics has internally explicable mechanisms as
well, and that when these are not recognized it is only because we have not been
able to find them.2 A further problem that we face in the instance at hand is
due to the fact that contact between Indo-European and Kartvelian continued,
perhaps for thousands of years without a break, though perhaps somewhat less
intensely at some times than at others. Thus we must be careful to disentangle the
oldest features from the web of diffused structural characteristics. Similarly we
face the difficulty of distinguishing between possible diffusion due to contact at
the level of proto-language or subgroup and possible diffusion due to influence
from sin gle languages, for exam ple Armenian contact with the individual
Kartvelian languages.
A final point that must be emphasized for its relation to the discussion below
is the fact that the absence of parallels does not, indeed cannot, establish the
absence of contact. Thus, although I will argue below that the syntactic structure
of Indo-European may not be as parallel to that of Kartvelian as Gamkrelidze and
Ivanov have suggested, it must be remembered that this does not by any means
establish that there was no contact, or even that that contact was less intense than
2. An example of this is the evidential, seemingly an areal feature; we can,
however, show the language internal mechanisms by which it arose in Kartvelian
(Harris 1985).

claim ed by the authors. It accomplishes no more and no less than calling into
question one piece of the evidence they adduce in support of their hypothesis.
2. Proposed Syntactic (Alignment) Parallels
2.1. Case Alignment and the Structure of the Proposal Concerning It
The term alignment is not used by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, but is one
introduced by Plank 1979, and one I have used extensively in my own writing on
this subject. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984 follow Fillmore (1968: 54) in defining
ergative, accusative, and active distributions of cases, all of which together I refer
to as "alignment.”3 In a language with ergative case marking, the subject o f a
transitive (S tr) is marked with one case, while the direct object (O) and the
subjects of intransitive verbs ( S intr) are marked with another. In the schema, the
lines indicate the distributional boundaries of the case.
ergative
Figure 1: Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1984:313)
3. Rather, it is the general idea of Fillmore’s figures that they adopt,
changing his constant A (agent) and О (object) to other terms, depending upon
which alignment they describe. They also cite Sapir 1917.



72 When Worlds Collide
In accusative case marking, the direct object (O) is marked with one case, while
all subjects (S) are marked with another.
Figure 2: Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1984:314)
Active case marking systems have one case marking the subject of transitives and
o f active intransitives (both A), while another case is assigned to the subject of
inactive intransitives and to direct objects (both In).
active
Figure 3: Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1984:313)
Like a number o f other Indoeuropeanists, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984
reconstruct to Proto-Indo-European a binary opposition between animate and



Harris 73
inanimate nouns. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov present evidence that both *-os and
*-om can be reconstructed as formants of the genitive case. These authors argue
that, although the distribution of these endings was later altered, originally
*-os was used for inanimates, *-om for animates. For them, other facts confirm
this binary opposition in other spheres. An evaluation of these arguments within
Indo-European is more appropriately undertaken by Indo-Europeanists and lies
quite outside the scope of the present paper.
Having accepted an opposition between animate and inanimate nouns in
Proto-Indo-European, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1984:314) state correlates (or
im plications) o f the several alignment types, follow ing, for the most part,
proposals in Klimov 1973, 1977 and the same author’s other works. In languages
with the ergative and accusative types of case marking, they say, there exists an
opposition between transitive and intransitive verbs. In languages with case
marking of the active type, they continue, there is no such opposition of transitive
to intransitive, but there is instead an opposition of animate to inanimate nouns.
On this basis they argue that Proto-Indo-European had case marking of the active
type.
The authors continue by citing Klimov’s 1973 statements (also in subsequent
works) that Common Kartvelian was likewise active. The two language families
changed in different directions, they believe, with Indo-European eventually
developing case marking of the accusative type, and Kartvelian developing case
marking of the ergative type.4
4. Both their hypothesis for Indo-European and their hypothesis for
Kartvelian, following Klimov 1977, are based on the position that either ergative
or accusative structures can develop from active, but that the reverse is not
possible (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984:318). This idea would not be accepted by
most linguists.



74 When Worlds Collide
2.2. Assessing the Ancestral Active Hypothesis
2.2.1 Problems Relating to Indo-European
As observed above (section 2.1), Gamkrelidze and Ivanov follow Fillmore
1968 in defining specific alignment types in terms of the distribution of cases,
citin g his schem a, in Figures 1-3 (Gam krelidze and Ivanov’s Figures 2-4,
1984:313-315), and his descriptions. However, to Fillmore’s definitions they add the
claim s that there are correlations with tra n sitiv e/in tra n sitiv e and
anim ate/inanim ate dichotom ies, as stated above. A problem then arises in
identifying a specific language as belonging to one type or the other; when there
is a con flict between the actual distribution of case markers and the two
dichotom ies named, which of these w ill be the determining factor? We have
already seen that instead of using the distributional definitions they give, in
identifying the alignment type of a particular language the authors use the
putative correlations between case distribution and the otherwise unrelated
phenomenon of an animate/inanim ate distinction in nouns. For example, in
identifying the original alignment type of Proto-Indo-European, they use the
criterion of animate/inanim ate as a grammatical category and on this basis
conclude that the language had active case marking, without regard to the actual
distribution or use of the cases. They might have reconstructed the distribution of
cases on the basis of archaic patterns of case distribution preserved in daughter
languages and on this basis determined the alignment type for case marking in the
proto-language. Instead, they reconstructed an animate/inanimate dichotomy on the
basis of archaic morphology preserved in daughter languages and on this basis
made claims about the distribution of case in the proto-language.
This reconstruction and the hypotheses upon which it rests pose serious
problems from at least two points of view. First, the putative correlations
proposed by Klimov 1973 were not based on a systematic investigation according
to objective, stated criteria. The supposed correlations have not been widely



Harris 75
accepted.5
A second problem, related to the first, concerns the methodology used. Even if
the correlates proposed by Klimov turn out to be entirely accurate, why should a
correlate, rather than the defining feature, be used in identifying the type of an
individual language? For most scholars in the West it has been the syntactic
distribution of case marking that formed the only diagnostic for identifying an
alignment type. Identification o f type is meaningless unless there is a clear
criterion for the typing, and it is distribution that scholars in the West have relied
on. Clearly hypotheses regarding alignment type are untestable or meaningless
without a reliable criterion. For several generations, most scholars in the West
have rejected the idea of whole-language typologies (ones that would claim a
correlation between morphological type and word order type, for example), and
for them the grammaticalization o f animate/inanimate or transitive/intransitive
distinctions must be considered independently of alignment type (see Harris
1986:56-57).
In the typology set up by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1983:313-319), distribution
o f cases (Figures 1-3) has typological correlates in binary divisions between
transitive and intransitive (for ergative and nominative alignment) or between
animate and inanimate nouns (for active alignment). The structure of their
argument is this: if the proto-language had the correlate of active alignment,
namely the binary division animate/inanimate, one can infer that it had active
alignment. This is a typological argument. This kind of typological approach to
historical linguistics has received severe criticism from a number of scholars (e.g.,
Campbell and Mithun 1980, Jeffers 1976, Watkins 1976) and is not accepted by
most linguists.
2.2.2. Problems Relating to the Comparison with Kartvelian
5. For example, see Comrie 1976:254-255 on the dubious validity of the
correlates.



76 When Worlds Collide
For the alignment o f Kartvelian, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov cite Klimov’s
statements that the proto-language was active (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984:318);
we must therefore examine the basis on which Klimov reached this conclusion. On
he whole, Klimov seems to have considered the modern Kartvelian languages to
have ergative case marking because this is the traditional view.6 Klimov (1973:50)
cites patterns such as the following as the basis for reconstructing earlier case
patterns: e.g., deda-m it'ira [mother-Nar she-cry] ‘(the) mother cried.’ Here the
so-called narrative (or ergative) case marks the subject of an active intransitive.
Klimov concludes that this indicates that case marking in the proto-language was
active.
Here Klimov has, in fact, used distributional criteria, finding evidence of the
pattern in Figure 3 above, labelled active. The problem with his analysis here is
that he has used the regular pattern of the language as evidence of an archaism. It
is well-established practice in linguistics that what is regular and productive is the
basis for a synchronic analysis, while what is irregular, restricted, and archaic is
the basis for reconstruction of earlier stages (Kurylowicz 1964:10, Meillet 1954:27,
Watkins 1976). The class of verbs and the case marking pattern cited by Klimov is
entirely regular and productive in the language (as established by Holisky 1981).
Klimov, in the works cited, offers no evidence as to whether this is an old state of
affairs or the result of later innovations; his inference that it is archaic is thus
unfounded.
Klimov 1976 examines the case marking patterns of Laz, one of the
Kartvelian languages. Here he reports that one case, with a zero-morpheme, marks
direct objects, while subjects are marked with the ending -k or zero. According to
his analysis, one zero morpheme represents one case, while - k and zero are
alternants (allomorphs) of a second case. Since the zero-marked subject is used just
6. Strictly speaking, for Georgian and Svan this statement relates only to a
subsystem traditionally termed Series II.



Hams 77
with in active intransitives, while the it-m arked subject occurs with active
intransitives and with transitives, Klimov concludes that Laz preserves this
distribution of a former system. Again he has used productive patterns, rather than
relics, as an indicator o f earlier patterns; but here he has broken another
elem entary principle of linguistic analysis. Basic tenets would require the
zero-marked forms to be treated as one case, the Jt-marked forms as a second
case; they cannot be mixed in an unprincipled way. Analyzing the cases in this
way would have resulted in an entirely different analysis.
In spite of the problems outlined above, I have argued that when dealing with
the Kartvelian languages, we cannot simply dismiss Klimov’s theory out of hand,
because of the important contributions he has made to Kartvelian studies in his
earlier work (Harris 1985:12, note 2).
An additional problem here is that, whatever our opinion of the criterion used
to determine the alignment of Proto-Indo-European, it is not the same criterion as
that used to determine the alignment of Common Kartvelian.7 Results obtained on
the basis of the criterion of correlates is not directly comparable with results
obtained on the basis of distribution.
2.2.2. A Distributional Approach
My 1985 book (Harris 1985) is devoted entirely to the question of the original
case marking type of Kartvelian and the changes that system subsequently
underwent. I argued there that the original case system was ergative, not active, in
alignment. Because the work by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984 is dated a year
earlier, it is worth pointing out that their book was bot actuality released that
year, and my copy did not reach me until after my own book had appeared in
print. My book was in no sense an argument against their thesis, and I was quite
7. Klimov has also reached the conclusion that Proto-Indo-European had
active alignment; for some discussion, see Klimov 1977:209ff.



78 When Worlds Collide
unaware o f the content of their book until much later. My argument was made
entirely independently of anything contained in Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984; I
was, however, aware of Klimov 1973, 1976, 1977, and other works.
How could I have reached conclusions so different from those reached by
Klimov and adopted by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov? First, like most other scholars
working on alignment, I do not accept the validity of the correlation of case
marking alignm ent with either a transitive-intransitive dichotom y or an
anim ate-inanim ate dichotomy. Therefore, in identifying the alignment o f case
marking in any language, I relied entirely on the distribution of cases. Thus, I use
the distributional table from Sapir 1917 or the figures from Fillmore 1968, both
cited by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984, as the sole basis for typing. Second, unlike
Klimov in the works cited above, I used productive patterns for determining
current structure and unproductive relics in internal reconstruction to arrive at
older stages, according to accepted practice. I followed other standard procedures
of linguistic analysis and described my methods in a separate section (Chapter 2).
The relics used in my reconstruction involve the syntactic patterns governed
by specific verbs, such as the verb ‘come, go.’ Some of these have been regularized
in the historical period, while others remain irregular. For example, in Old
Georgian we find the sentence in (1) in several different locations.
(1) katam-i q’iva (Mt 26:74; L 22:60, J 18:27)
chicken-Nom he/crow
‘The cock crowed.’
In Modern Georgian this would be ungrammatical; we find instead (2).
(2) mamal-ma iq’ivla
cock-Nar he/crow
‘The cock crowed.’
The case traditionally called the narrative (Nar) is used in this subsystem to mark



Harris 79
subjects of transitive verbs; at issue is its use in marking subjects of active
intransitive verbs, as in (2). The case traditionally called the nominative (Nom)
marks direct objects and subjects of inactive intransitives in this subsystem; at
issue is its use to mark subjects of active intransitives, as in (1).
Example (1) can be identified as a relic on the grounds that it is both
irregular in Old Georgian and is archaic, rather than an innovation. We know that
it is irregular in Old Georgian because other verbs of the same morphological type
do not occur in this pattern, that is with a subject in the so-called nominative
case. We know that the irregularity must be archaic, rather than innovative,
because over the course of history it changed to correspond to the productive
pattern, illustrated in (2). These procedures are absolutely standard in diachronic
linguistics. Principles that were first developed for phonology are here applied to
syntax, as has been done in the reconstruction of syntax in other language families.
The significance of the examples above is that they point to a time when the
subject o f the active intransitive was marked with the so-called nominative case,
as the subjects o f active intransitives are still. That is, if we assume that lexical
relics of this sort preserve an earlier situation, then the system we must reconstruct
has the distribution in Figure 4, following the format set up above.
ergative

80 When Worlds Collide
When the cases are encircled, follow ing Figures 1-3, we see that this is an
ergative pattern. The pattern found today in Georgian, however, is shown in
Figure S, which takes into account changes also in the form of the suffixes.
active
Figure 5: Pattern of Modern Georgian8
It may be noted that this trend in the history of Georgian has been previously
described, in particular by Shanidze (1973:483-484). Here Shanidze put no labels
on the case marking patterns, but observed that the use of the narrative case with
active intransitives seems to be secondary.
In Harris (1985:133-141) I explicitly compared my hypothesis, which I referred
to as the Ancestral Ergative Hypothesis, with Klimov’s proposal, referred to there
as the Ancestral Active Hypothesis. I adduced nine arguments against the latter, all
of them following established linguistic principles.
Given that there is a difference between the criteria used by Gamkrelidze and
Ivanov 1984 and the criterion used in my work (Harris 1985), we may agree that
8. In Modern Georgian the pattern in Figure 5 is found only in the set of
tense-aspect paradigms known as Series II; for further discussion of the relation of
this to other patterns in the language see Harris 1985.



Harris 81
the different labels applied are due to the different diagnostics. Therefore, let us
put aside the labels and compare the facts on which they are based.
2.2.3. The Binary Opposition of Animate/inanimate Nouns
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s typing of Proto-Indo-European is based on the
opposition of animate to inanimate nouns. If Common Kartvelian had the same
structure in this regard, we should find there too a binary opposition between
nouns.
There is no morphological difference between animate and inanimate in any
modern Kartvelian language. Nor do we find any morphological difference
between human and non-human, or other categories that might be expected to
have evolved out of an earlier dichotomy based on animacy. In all Kartvelian
languages there is a single declension used for all nouns, except in Svan. This is a
secondary development in Svan (see Harris 1985, Chapter 4, and sources cited
there), and no one has suggested that this development in Svan had anything to do
with an opposition of animate to inanimate or a related dichotomy.
H ow ever, it has, in fact, been suggested that Kartvelian once had an
opposition o f animate to inanimate (Chikobava 1942). Interestingly, this was
proposed as a basis for establishing a genetic relation between Kartvelian and the
North Caucasian languages, especially North East Caucasian, for which a
gender-class system is reconstructed.9 Chikobava, in the work cited, reconstructs
*m- as the marker of the human (adam ianis) class in the noun itself and *s~, d-,
n-, r—, /-, etc. as markers of the inanimate (nivtis ‘thing’) class in the noun. In the
daughter languages, reflexes of *m- are productive in the formation of agentive
nouns, such as me-(u)p-e ‘monarch’ from the root up ‘reign,’ thus ‘one who reigns.’
9. Dzavakishvili 1937 had earlier argued for reconstructing a class system
for Common Kartvelian. Because he did not discuss the inanimate class(es), I have
omitted his work here.



82 When Worlds Collide
This is the sort o f insight on which Chikobava’s argument rests, and we have no
d ifficu lty im agining that a marker o f the human class might come to be used as a
formant o f agentives. What is troublesome is that some other prefixes that begin
with m - or circum fixes that contain m - form words that are not animate. While I
do not find Chikobava’s arguments convincing, we must conclude that a claim that
Common K artvelian made a binary division between animate and inanimate would
not be without basis.10
2.3. Conclusion Concerning Proposed Syntactic (Alignment) Parallel
The alignm ent argument made by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984 has two
distinct parts. One is the reconstruction of the syntactic distribution of cases; the
second is the morphological distinction between animate and inanimate nouns,
taken by the authors as their basis for reconstructing the syntactic distribution of
cases. I have argued at length (in Harris 1985) that Common Kartvelian did not
have active alignm ent, as claimed by Klimov 1976, and no new evidence has been
presented by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov to support their claim. In the present paper,
I have summarized the argument that the morphological marking o f a distinction
betw een anim ate and inanim ate nouns is not an appropriate basis for
reconstructing the distribution o f cases. Thus, I find no convincing evidence that
Proto-Indo-European and Common Kartvelian had the same case alignment; I find
no syntactic parallel.
3. Proposed Phonological (and Morphological) Parallels
10. The parallel between the phonetic substance of the two Kartvelian
prefixes and that o f the two reconstructed Indo-European suffixes has not escaped
my notice. A more extensive critique o f Chikobava’a reconstruction is given in
Deeters 1955.



Harris 83
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov propose five principal parallels involving the
p hon ological system: the inventory of consonants, the sonorant system , the
canonical form o f root and a ffix , the rules for combining them, and the ablaut
system.
C haracteristic of the Proto-Indo-European, Kartvelian, and
Semitic languages is an isomorphic structure in the consonant
system, with three series of stops: glottalized (or pharyngealized),
voiced, and voiceless. The Kartvelian and Indo-European
languages show an identical system with syllabic and non-syllabic
variants depending on the position they occupy in the word. The
construction of root and affi x morphemes and the rules for
combining them into multimorphemic sequences, with a mechanism
of alternation of vowels based on ablaut are also identical in the
linguistic systems. (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1985:14)
The first o f these, the "glottalic theory" has already been the subject o f much
discussion, and treatment o f it falls outside the scope of this paper. The others are
each discussed briefly below.
I assume that Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, in the passage quoted, are referring to
K urylowicz’s notion o f isomorphism, which entails structural similarity (Kurylowicz
1973). They also use the term identical twice in that paragraph in characterizing
the systems of Indo-European in comparison with those of Kartvelian. The extent
to which these are indeed alike is the principal issue addressed in the subsections
below.
3.1. The Sonorant System
The sonorant system o f Common K artvelian was studied in detail in
Gamkrelidze and Machavariani 1965 and its parallels with Indo-European were
likew ise discussed there. While the two systems may not be identical, as claimed in
the passage quoted above, they do have the kinds of structural parallels that might
result from d iffu sion in a situation of close contact. The Kartvelian system
involved the phonemes *w, у, l, r, m, n, each with a syllabic and a non-syllabic



84 When Worlds Collide
allophone. The environments that conditioned the various allophones are similar to
those reconstructed for Indo-European (Gamkrelidze and Machavariani 1965).
A lthough the ablaut and sonorant systems in Kartvelian do not interact in as
com plex a way as in Indo-European, this d ifference may be natural where the
parallels result from diffusion, rather than from inheritance.
3.2. Canonical Form o f Root and A ffix
In G am krelidze and M achavariani (1965:303 ff.) and in Gamkrelidze and
Ivanov (1984:253 ff.) the canonical form o f roots in Common Kartvelian is given
as basically CVC and that of suffixes as basically -VC. This is the basis for the
statement that Indo-European and Kartvelian are isomorphic, for the formulae
given are identical (G am krelidze and Ivanov 1984: 216 ff., Gamkrelidze and
Machavariani 1965:377), and in both instances "C may represent a consonant or
sonorant. However, consideration o f details shows that the possible realizations in
the two fam ilies are not id en tic a l, in the ordinary sense o f that word. The
discussion below is based on Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s description o f the complex
issue o f root structure in Indo-European.11 The formula obscures the fact that ”C
in the root can also be a decessive harmonic cluster in Common Kartvelian. The
points o f articulation of the segments composing a decessive cluster progress
towards the rear o f the oral cavity. The Kartvelian rules of harmonic clusters put
restrictions on the types of consonants (with respect to manner o f articulation) that
can be combined (see Vogt 1958, M achavariani 1965 for details). Only one o f the
tw o C’s m ay be a d e c e ssiv e harm onic c lu ste r , eith er m orp h em e-in itial or
m orphem e-final (Gamkrelidze and Machavariani 1965:305, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov
1984:255).
Indo-European permitted a morpheme-initial cluster of s plus a consonant1
11. Given the complexity o f the problems involved in Indo-European root
structure, exceptions to some o f my statem ents w ill certainly be found.
Nevertheless, the generalizations made here hold for the vast majority of roots.
My purpose here is to point out some problems with the claimed identicalness of
structure.



Harris 85
(Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984:217). For Common Kartvelian, the dictionary of
roots lists one root in #(s)t and six in #(sl)t (Klimov 1964:160-179). In each of the
six, the provisional reconstruction of *j 1 is based on the presence o f a reflex in
Svan alon e, the other languages having # t (com pare G am krelidze and
Machavariani 1965:130-140). If the reconstruction of s lt is correct, Kartvelian,
unlike Indo-European, permits clusters with s initial to occur elsewhere in the
morpheme; e.g., *da(s1)tw - ‘bear,’ cf. Georgian d a tv - i ‘bear’ (Klimov 1964:70);
* -e (sl)t topographical su ffix, cf. Georgian -e t (Klimov 1964:80); *a(sl)t ‘ten,’ cf.
Georgian a t- i ‘ten’ (Klimov 1964:45). In Kartvelian, sibilants could also follow
another consonant in a root-initial cluster, *ps ‘urinate’ (Klimov 1964:191), or
occur betw een a sonorant and another sibilant; * m sx a l- ‘p ea r,’ cf. G eorgian
m sxal-i ‘pear’ (Klimov 1964:137).
In Indo-European and Kartvelian alike, "C” in the formula may also represent
a consonant com bined with a sonorant. In root-initial position, this may be a
consonant follow ed by a sonorant, and in root-final position a sonorant followed
by a consonant (1985:217, 253). In Kartvelian, but evidently not in Indo-European,
the root-initial "C" may consist of a sonorant followed by a consonant or a cluster;
fo r exam ple * m s x a l- ‘pear,’ cf. G eorgian m s x a l- i ‘p ear’ (G am k relid ze and
Machavariani 1965:334); *rt’q’ ‘hit,’ cf. Old Georgian art'q'ams ‘h e/she hits someone
with something’ (Klimov 1964:157); *wlt’ ‘flee ,’ cf. Old Georgian w iw lt’i ‘I flee’
(K lim ov 1964:85). The r o o t-fin a l "C" may consist o f a consonant or cluster
fo llo w ed by a sonorant; for exam ple *dz lay 12‘d og,’ cf. d za y[ ‘d o g ’ (K lim ov
1964:236).
In Kartvelian, "C" may also be realized as a consonant plus w, a combination
which Gamkrelidze and Ivanov interpret as a labialized consonant and which they
compare with Indo-European labialized consonants (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov
1984:256). This is limited to one per morpheme.
K artvelian exceptions to the root form CVC include the structure C (eg.
*Y‘receive,’ cf. Georgian iy e b s ‘he/she receives it’), CV (eg. *da, c f. G eorgian
da ‘sister’), CCV (eg. *gza, cf. Georgian gza ‘way, road’), VC (eg. *at, cf. Georgian
12. The symbol d z represents a voiced palatal affricate.



86 When Worlds Collide
at-i ‘ten,’ and others (all examples from Gamkrelidze and Machavariani 1965:307
ff.). Of these, CV in Indo-European is lim ited to pronouns and particles
(Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984:218), VC occurs more widely (1984:217), and the
others are not included in the inventory (1984: 216-219).
Indo-European had other constraints on the canonical form of roots
represented by the simple formula CVC, including (in traditional terms) (1) the
prohibition against the same stop occurring in the two C positions, and (2) the
proscription of a voiceless aspirate occurring with a voiced consonant
(Gam krelidze and Ivanov 1984:18-20). Kartvelian permits the combination
described in (1) in roots like *deda ‘mother* (Klimov 1964:71), *dud ‘tip’ (Klimov
1964:75), *k’ak'al ‘walnut’ (Klimov 1964:105), *t‘ot’ ‘branch, arm’ (Klimov 1964:182),
*t'ut'a ‘ashes’ (Klimov 1964:183), *ке(п)к ‘rummage’ (Klimov 1964:197). Not only
may these two consonants be the same in Kartvelian, according to a rule stated by
Machavariani (1965:80), if the consonants are both labial or both dental, they are
required to be the same in voicing and glottalization; thus *pab, *pap' a n d
*p’ap are ruled out in Kartvelian. There appear to be few Kartvelian roots of the
form described in (2), but K lim ov (1964:195) lists two: *kab- ‘know ’ and
*ka d - ‘err, be mistaken.’ An additional constraint on Indo-European roots,
expressed by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov in terms of their glottalic theory, is said to
be shared, not only with Kartvelian, but with other languages that have glottalic
consonants (1984:18).13
Because of the large number of possible realizations of C in the CVC root
formula, and because of the large number of exceptions to the formula, there is
really not a great similarity between the canonical form of roots in Indo-European
and Kartvelian. Some of the examples adduced above may turn out to be no more
13. As they state the constraint (loc cit), non-identical ejective stops do not
cooccur in roots of the structure C'VC1. Although "C" is understood to include
consonant clusters in the statement of the canonical form of the root (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984:253 ff.), evidently they are using the symbol "C* here to represent
a single consonant. The two Common Kartvelian roots *c'q'int'l- ‘unripe, immature’
and *c'q4et‘- ‘press’ (Klim ov 1964:256) each have an ejective stop {q' and t')
included in a consonant cluster in each of the two C positions.



Harris 87
than exceptions to otherwise valid generalizations. Nevertheless, it remains true
that Kartvelian roots on the whole are quite different from Indo-European roots.
While some Kartvelian roots do share the CVC form, roots like the following do
not look like Indo-European: b{g- ‘fight,’ *rc’q’a - ‘water,’ *t'k’wer- 'crack open,'
*rt‘q'- ‘gird,’ *m sxal- ‘pear,’ *mq‘a r- ‘shoulder,’ *mc1e r - ‘insect,’ *k'[de ‘cliff,
boulder,’ *t'w'oc- ‘throw, hit’ (Klimov 1964:53, 159, 182, 157, 137, 144, 141, 113,
184). Yet roots like these are very common in Kartvelian.
Kartvelian suffixes of the form -V were not unusual at the earliest period (eg.
*-a, marker of third person singular subject agreement in certain tense-aspect
categories, *-e, formant of the optative). Suffixes o f the form -C(V) seem also to
have existed at the oldest stage reconstructable; for example *-n(a), an ancient
suffix found in locatives and pronouns, cf. Georgian *me-na T (see Gamkrelidze
1959:37-38). Thus, if the canonical form of suffixes is presented as -VC, we must
at the very least acknowledge the existence of many exceptions.
If we add the forms of prefixes, we find as much variation as in the form of
roots and suffixes. The following patterns all date from Common Kartvelian: V-,
eg. *a- transitive formant, *i- with various meanings, including medio-passive; C-,
eg. *m- first person object, *g- second person object; CV-, eg. *li-/si- prefix used
in word formation, *la-/sa- prefix used in word formation (compare Klimov
1964:42, 100, 123, 57, 172, 168).
The description above reveals that the canonical forms of roots and affixes of
Indo-European and Kartvelian do not have a great deal in common. The form of
roots in Kartvelian is limited primarily by the constraint on decessive harmonic
clusters and the proscription against two unlike glottalic stops in the two C
positions in roots of the form CVC. Indo-European shares only the last of these,
which is claim ed to be universal or extremely common (M elikishvili 1970,
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984:18) and is thus not relevant to claims of diffusion.
3.3. The Rules for Combining Morphemes
In the quotation at the beginning of section 3 above, the "rules for combining
[root and affix morphemes] into multimorphemic sequences" might be understood
in a number of different ways. Some of these will be discussed below.



88 When Worlds ColHde
The Kartvelian languages employ prefixes, suffixes, and circumfixes. While
the last of these may distinguish this family’s morphological rules from those of
Indo-European, the circumfixes show evidence of being secondary, the result of
combining prefixes and suffixes in a unified function. Prefixes may have been
more important than suffixes in inflection and derivation in archaic Common
Kartvelian (see Gamkrelidze and Machavariani 1965:373).
In terms of morphological type, the two families are not obviously parallel.
The K artvelian languages are predom inantly agglutinating, while the
Indo-European languages, in their attested forms, are mostly fusional. This need
not be an overwhelming problem, however, as there is evidence for agglutination
in Proto-Indo-European as well.
The internal structure of words in the two families, especially finite verbs,
does not show a high degree of parallelism. In all Kartvelian languages we find
some evidence for at least the follow ing morpheme "slots," in this order: (1)
agreement markers, (2) character vowel, (3) root, (4) series marker, (5) stem
augment, (6) screeve marker, (7) agreement markers. A preverb is also found in
slot (0), but this is generally considered secondary. Agreement markers in slot (1)
include at least the first person subject marker and markers of first and second
person objects; prefixal agreement markers are not found in Indo-European.
Among the functions of character vowels (2) is to serve as a morphological
marking o f syntactic processes involving benefactives and possessors (Harris 1981,
Ch. 6); another is marking medio-passives. Although both of these functions may
be secondary, this morphological "slot” appears to be very old; it is doubtful that a
p arallel ex ists in Indo-European. Morphemes that follow the root form
tense-aspect categories, serve derivational functions such as inchoative and
causative, and mark other agreement; many of these are secondary.
To describe the process of combining morphemes, Gamkrelidze and
M ach avarian i (1965:76) p rop ose the P rinciple of M onovocalicity: "In a
polymorphemic form, only one morpheme may occur in the normal grade.” As
Gamkrelidze and Machavariani note (1965:372), this cannot explain the fact that
we find i-grade in some forms with normal grade suffixes, but 0-grade in others.
A proposal in terms of sp ecific phonological processes which were later
m orphologized comes closer to accounting for all the facts. These include



Harris 89
progressive and regressive syncope and vowel reduction. Two of these rules are
stated below; they led to the ablaut system, discussed in the next subsection (see
Harris 1985, Ch. 8 for discussion of details).
(3) Vowel Reduction
e —> i / С . C + V(C)
(4) Regressive Syncope
I V I —> 0 / C _ C + V(C),
bhigh I
where (4) was a later rule and applied to the output of (3).
Gam krelidze and Ivanov (1984:257-8) reconstruct an ancient system of
reduplication in Kartvelian languages, and this could be included as part of the
system of combining morphemes. As they reconstruct it, there was partial
reduplication with voicing of the initial segment and sometimes with excrescent
n at the end of the reduplicated prefix; the vowel may be i, e, o, or a. In the two
examples where the non-reduplicated root survives, reduplication seems to have
served to form nouns. The authors compare Kartvelian reduplication with that in
Indo-European, citing a nice example where both language groups form ‘wheel’ by
reduplication from the root ‘turn.’ Here the Indo-European reduplication follows
the pattern of a repetition of the first root consonant plus the vowel e
(*klhreklhrl-o - , Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984:220), while the Kartvelian example,
according to their analysis, involves repetition of the full syllable, but in 0-grade
(* b {-b a r, 1984:258); therefore the example cannot be a caique. The rules of
reduplication in Kartvelian, as one may infer from the examples presented, would
have allowed Kartvelian to follow the same pattern as Indo-European; yet here
there is no calquing. The presence of a caique would have more strongly suggested
contact.
Reduplication is very common in languages of the world, and the process
often involves only partial repetition, as it does here. The authors draw analogy
with Shuswap and Squamish, two Salishan languages; one could add examples from

many other families: Ewe, Yidiny, Indonesian, Tagalog, Niuean, etc. The use of
voicing in the repeated initial seems to be unusual and is thus the sort of feature
that might indicate diffusion in a Kartvelian-Indo-European Sprachbund - i f it
were present in Indo-European.
3.4. Ablaut
The ablaut system of Common Kartvelian was likew ise similar, but not
identical, to that of Proto-Indo-European, as suggested in the quotation above.
Specifically, the vowel alternations in Common Kartvelian involved e ~ i ~ 0 (the
best understood), as well as e ~ e: (probable), and possibly a ~ 0 , e ~ 0, and e
a ~ 0. We do not find the vowel о involved in Kartvelian ablaut, as it was in the
e ~ о ~ 0 pattern of Indo-European, assuming no laryngeals following о at this
stage.
While the Kartvelian system became a true ablaut system, that is a system of
morphologically conditioned vowel alternation, at least some of the alternations
can be seen to have arisen out of originally productive phonological processes,
dependent in part on movable accent (see Gamkrelidze and Machavariani 1965:370,
Harris 1985:170-176; compare in this regard, Schmidt 1962:41, Schmidt 1971:266).
Thus we may assume that the origin of the ablaut systems in the two
proto-languages involved similar processes. The fact that an internal cause can be
identified for this development in no way suggests that contact was not also
responsible for it.
In terms of function, the two ablaut systems are not identical. Within the
verb, the functions are difficult to compare because of the different structures of
the tense-aspect-mood systems in the two families. One of the clearest functions of
ablaut in the attested Kartvelian languages was to distinguish transitive from
intransitive forms (see Gamkrelidze and Machavariani 1965: 179ff. and Harris
1985, Ch. 8), and this is almost certainly one of its original functions; compare Old
Georgian v-d rik '-e T bent it* with v-d erk ’ ‘I bent’ (intransitive). Ablaut also
distinguished among subject persons of the verb. This is a somewhat later
development, the result of syncope, (4), which remained a productive rule quite
late; compare Old Georgian v-derk’ T bent (intransitive)’ with drk’-a ‘he/sh e/it



Harris 91
bent (intransitive).*
One o f the functions of ablaut in Proto-Indo-European was the formation of
the aorist, but it would be difficult to say that this was a function of ablaut in
Common Kartvelian. In the ancient Kartvelian tense-aspect categories known as
Series II, ablaut did not have the function of distinguishing aorist forms from
those of the other paradigms, permansive and subjunctive, for transitive verbs;
compare Old Georgian aorist v-drik’-e ‘I bent it* with the permansive v-drik’-i ‘I
bend it" and the subjunctive v-drik'-o ‘I might, will bend it.* For intransitive verbs,
the aorist was distinguished from the other paradigms in part by a contrast of
full-grad e to zero-grade, although it is not clear that this contrast had been
morphologized (been made part of the ablaut system), instead of being subject to
the productive rule of syncope, (4) (compare Old Georgian aorist v-t’ep ‘I warmed
up* with permansive v-t'p-i ‘I warm up’ and subjunctive v-t'p-e *1 might, will warm
up’). As a secondary phenomenon in Kartvelian, ablaut partially distinguished the
derived set of tense-aspect categories traditionally referred to as Series I from the
archaic set known as Series II, but this was originally based on the syntactic
intransitivity of Series I (Harris 198S). Thus, although in both proto-languages
ablaut was important in distinguishing between various forms of the verbs, the two
systems are not directly parallel in function.
Ablaut was evidently not involved in deriving nouns from verbs in Kartvelian
as it was in Indo-European.14 In the daughter languages other than Svan, the
deverbal nouns preserve the reflex of normal-grade (e-grade); compare Old
Georgian drek’-a ‘a bending.’ There are said to be three deverbal nouns formed
from some verbs in Svan. One is cognate with deverbal nouns of the sister
languages and, like them, preserves the e-grade; kw ec-a ‘breaking, cutting’
(Topuria 1968:213). A second, derived from the intransitive, likewise preserves the
normal-grade (e-grade) that characterizes intransitives (eg., li-kw ec ‘breaking
(intransitive).’ A third is derived from the transitive, although it preserves not the
14. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1984:258) describe formation of a noun by reduplication, possibly involving ablaut, but this would not be considered
formation of a noun by a change in ablaut grade.



92 When Worlds Collide
i-grade that characterized transitives, but the 0-grade that could be derived from
i- or e-grade by rule (4); eg., li-kwc-e ‘breaking (transitive)’ (Gamkrelidze and
M achavariani 1965:208). Ablaut does not seem to have played the role that
o-grade played in the formation of nouns in Indo-European.
The remarks above are intended to provide a better basis for assessing the
degree and kind of parallelism found in the systems of ablaut.
3.5. Conclusion Concerning Proposed Phonological (and Morphological) Parallels
There are clearly similarities between Indo-European and Kartvelian in the
four areas dealt with in this section: the sonorant system, the canonical form of
roots and affixes, the rules for combining morphemes into complex words, and the
ablaut system. In the last three categories there are also important differences,
including differing interpretations of the CVC formula for root structure, differing
constraints on this formula, exceptions to this formula and that for suffixes, use of
prefixal "character vowels" in verb forms, use of prefixal agreement markers,
different vow el alternations involved in ablaut. Whether or not the structural
similarities are great enough to qualify as "isomorphic" in Kurylowicz’s sense of
this term, these phenomena in these two language families are not identical in the
ordinary sense of this word.
Wherever possible, I have cited examples from Gamkrelidze and Machavariani
1965 or from Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984 in order to make the point that the
authors of the latter work are well aware of the phenomena discussed here. This
suggests that in the quotation above these authors are using the word identical in
some special sense. It is important to have these details discussed again here, since
many readers of their work will otherwise interpret identical as meaning ‘exactly
alike.’ Clearly the sub-systems of these two proto-languages are not alike in their
details.
4. Implications for Determining the Indo-European Homeland
A new proposal, locating the Indo-European homeland in eastern Anatolia,
has been made by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984 on the basis of very early



Harris 93
contacts between Indo-European, Kartvelian, and Semitic families. The argument
for very early, intense contact with Kartvelian takes the circumstantialist approach
described in section 1 of this paper and in the quotation below.
One group’s approach [to areal linguistics1 has been merely to
catalog the similarities found in a particular area -allowing these
sim ilarities to suggest diffusion, but without carrying out the
research necessary to demonstrate the actual borrowing. (Campbell,
Smith-Stark, and Kaufman 1986:534)
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov have proposed parallels in the areas of (i) phonology (as
listed in section 3 of the present paper), (ii) syntax (discussed in section 2 above),
and (iii) lexical items (which fall outside the scope of the' present paper). They
have allowed these similarities to suggest diffusion.15 Lest it be thought that these
amassed parallels uniformly support contact, and hence the proposed homeland, we
should consider very carefully the nature of the phenomena suggested as parallels.
As discussed in section 1 above and in works on language contact, in
evaluating proposed diffusion of a phenomenon we need to take into account how
unusual or common the feature is among languages of the world. A feature that is
unusual among languages of the world is more highly valued as a diagnostic of
contact than one that is common, since this increases the possibility that it was
actually borrowed, rather than developing independently.
Although it was shown in section 2 that no syntactic parallel has been
demonstrated to have existed between Indo-European and Kartvelian, section 3
discusses four real, if limited, phonological parallels between these families. Are
these parallel features unusual enough to be considered diagnostic of contact? All
four of these phenomena are, in fact, very common and could easily have
15. After the presentation o f this paper at the conference, Gamkrelidze
remarked that the syntactic parallels which he and Ivanov had proposed were
never intended as evidence of contact, but as facts that could be explained by
contact. In the present paper I have argued that in case alignment there is, in fact,
no parallel to be explained. The parallels in phonology and morphology require no
explanation, for each of them is quite common in languages.



94 When Worlds Collide
developed independently. The alternations in the sonorant system are due to
physical (universal) properties of these sounds; a tendency to make them syllabic
in the environment of consonants, and non-syllabic in the environment of vowels,
is a natural consequence of these physical properties.
As discussed in section 3.2, there is really very little similarity between the
structure of roots in Indo-European and in Kartvelian. In Kartvelian the structure
of suffixes is not very tightly constrained (there is no form that is entirely
proscribed), and therefore it provides little possibility of being a feature unusual
enough to be diagnostic of contact. I see no genuine parallel of canonical form
except the proscription of non-idential glottalized stops as the two consonants in
the formula C W C 1. A ccording to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1984:18), this
constraint is universal or very common in languages having glottalized consonants.
Its very commonness makes it a characteristic incapable of indicating diffusion.
There is no aspect of the rules of combining morphemes that is unusual, including
the very common processes of vowel reduction and syncope. The single exception
that may be unusual is voicing of initials in reduplication; but this characteristic is
not found in Indo-European. Ablaut is a very common process among languages of
the world, and is thus not diagnostic of diffusion.
In the context of parallels that might suggest contact, what is particularly
disturbing is that none of the particular restrictions or other quirks of the system
of one language family is found in the other. The case for diffusion would be
much stronger, for example, if Kartvelian shared the Indo-European prohibition
against identical consonants in a root, or if Indo-European evinced decessive
harm onic clusters. Even the most common processes do not share many
characteristics in these two fam ilies. If we could at least show that ablaut
involved alternations of the same vowels in the two families, or that it served the
same functions, the evidence would be more convincing. In the absence of any of
these tell-tale traces that one of the systems really was borrowed, these parallels
remain unconvincing.
In order to make a convincing case for contact one must elim inate all
reasonable doubt concerning chance similarities and independent innovations, just
as in establishing any other historical fact. The existence of contact-induced
change in the phenomena examined in this paper has not been established.



Harris 95
The hypothesis that the Indo-European homeland was located in eastern
Anatolia does not rest on these proposed parallels alone and hence cannot be
evaluated on these bases alone. In this brief paper I have not discussed the lexical
correspondences or the consonant systems proposed as parallels between Kartvelian
and Indo-European,16 nor have I touched on the proposed parallels with Semitic.
The problems encountered in the materials that have been discussed here suggest
that careful consideration needs to be given to other aspects of this proposal. The
hypothesis o f the Anatolian homeland is a complex one that must be evaluated at
many levels. In the sections above I have discussed only a portion of the facts that
must be taken into account.

THE INCEPTION OF FARMING IN THE BRITISH ISLES AND THE EMERGENCE OF INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGES IN NW EUROPE
Roger J. Mercer University of Edinburgh
It is perhaps in the study of the neolithic that, in Europe, most preconceptions, most barriers to understanding and most outright problems have been overcome in the last twenty years. I say this as a researcher intimately involved with some of these problems and it therefore behooves me to say that workers in the neolithic have been at an enormous advantage in their enquiry. We have not been exposed to the seductive placebo that tells us that some outline model of basic social complexion is an understood datum against which our archaeological evidence is to be assessed. Within Iron Age studies we still regularly see the use of racial and linguistic terms (Celtic, Illyrian, Thraco-Cimmerian, Scythian, Teutonic, Germanic, etc., etc.) which must imply equation with societies mentioned, often described at second hand, but seldom defined by, classical authors. Such is the degree of material cultural continuity between our Bronze Age societies throughout Europe and these later manifestations that the cultural record of the second millennium BC has inevitably caught up in this web. The Neolithic has perhaps remained largely preserved from these pressures in its chronological isolation and in the occasional unfamiliarity of its material development. It has however, not escaped entirely. Ever since Vere Gordon Childe proclaimed the quintessential "Europeanness" of his vision of European prehistory while accepting its overall indebtedness to Eastern inspiration (Childe 1929) the pressure has been to amalgamate this vision with that which preceded it and against which to some extent he was reacting - the idea of IndoEuropean solidarity (Childe 1925). Elegant and persuasive models have been prominently presented drawing our later neolithic into the pattern, seeking to establish



102 When Worlds Collide
the roots of pan-European developments, as observed in the archaeological record, in eastern counterparts (Gimbutas, 1961). The two most prominent examples are, of course, the so-called Beaker and Corded Ware/Single Grave/Battle Axe traditions. But here "counter-revolution" from the isolated Alteuropa of the earlier neolithic, witnessed by the clear continuity between its early cultural expressions in the TRB and the Corded Ware development and thereby to the Beaker development has produced a confrontation between the small Division of the West assessing their new evidence afresh and the mighty divisions of the East couched in the scholarship and ideas of the nineteenth century. Britain, the Ultima Thule of Europe, has, perhaps been thought to lie beyond the limits of this debate. Yet its importance as the source for data in the light of which to discuss current ideas (Renfrew 1987) relating to the spread of Indo-European languages in N and W Europe in prehistory is not thereby diminished. My text therefore is the earliest registered neolithic farming development in Britain and, as in essence our interest, in this forum, is the arrival of cultural, ethnic or linguistic traits, perhaps I should focus for a short while on how I visualize this process occurring. Let me say before I begin that this is not a matter upon which there is universal agreement in British or wider archaeological circles. Our predicament is, and has been for a quarter of a century now, that the vast majority of our radiocarbon assays relating to this period have been obtained from deposits reflecting a fully established neolithic development in Britain and, with notable exceptions, have yielded dates of 3200 be or later. This chronological threshold coincides neatly with major vegetational changes where attention has focused, perhaps unduly, upon the very general and catastrophic reduction in the frequency of elm trees as witnessed by fossil pollen analysis. In many, but by no means all, instances this decline is accompanied by reductions in other arboreal species and is accompanied by increases in grasses, weeds of cultivation and other species associated with open ground that has undergone agricultural activity. It would be possible to view this relatively cataclysmic vegetational change alongside the "sudden" appearance of a fully established neolithic development as evidence of an abrupt and perhaps violent introduction of a farming economy to Britain. To do so, however, involves the rejection of some relatively slight evidence within Britain itself and the acceptance of major difficulties in so far as the wide-European evidence is concerned. In the European context two principal objections arise. Perhaps first is the universality of the vegetational phenomena referred to above. From Finland to the Rhineland to Ireland, the decline of the elm tree (which in itself defines the boundary of pollen zone VII/VIII) is broadly synchronous and can be seen over this vast tract of land to bear only an incidental relationship to the widely variant introduction of farming practice which ranges from the later fifth to the early second millennia be. Secondly is the lack of a satisfactorily defined antecedent development for the British neolithic in proximate continental Europe. If we are to accept the idea of a neolithic "descent" upon Southern Britain in the latter centuries of the fourth millennium be then we should logically seek the direct parallelisms that ought to exist between southern Britain and the near continent. These parallels simply do not exist other than in the most generalized terms and the tracing of specific parallels has met with a customary lack of success (Piggott 1954, Whittle 1977). To take an example



Mercer 103
which we will return to in another context, the whole of British early and middle neolithic archery is dominated by the highly distinctive and ubiquitous bi-facially worked leaf-shaped arrowhead. A few by no means closely similar arrowheads are known in Belgium and beyond this we have to look to NE Germany and the Iberian Peninsula. Furthermore, where we have a knowledge of artefact distribution - for example in the instance of stone axes with sources of rock in Brittany and Cornwall, in so far as we can recognise it, we see virtually no counter-supply (four axes of the socalled Group X Breton factory are known from the S coast of Britain). Similarly monumental developments in the early and middle neolithic in Britain are quite distinctive (while eclectically borrowing features) from continental peers and as the neolithic advances even their hazily stated debt to continental prototypes recedes to nothing as we enter the period of stone-circle and "henge" development. Within Britain itself the evidence exists, furthermore, for the existence of farming economies well prior to the advent of elm decline conditions (Edwards & Ralston 1984). Some, but by no means all, of these dates have been challenged (Kinnes forthcoming), but they cannot all simply be shrugged off. Furthermore, we return to the apparently well-established nature of the British neolithic from dates of at least 3200 be. Thirdly, we have the difficulty of the mesolithic hiatus- the generally scarce dates for mesolithic occupation after 4000 be especially in S. Britain (Jacobi 1973). If we are then to eschew a predominately "invasive" farming colonization of Britain, what model can one visualize for the transmission of this new mode of subsistence across the English Channel. For here indeed is the rub. Whereas up to this point the "Wave of Advance" model (Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza 1971) involving the "budding off' of daughter farming communities maintaining active communication with parent settlements does appear to be the modus operandi of the extension of farming across Europe up to 3500 be. That development appears to have taken place against the background of the climatic optimum in N and W Europe in the centuries surrounding 4000 be when prevailing circumstances may have favored that extension to a degree not hitherto possible. The curtailment of these favorable circumstances after c. 3500 be may well have blunted the edge of farming expansion but may well also have provoked crises among successful hunting communities on the fringe of the farming advance. We know that the aurochs had been extinguished in parts of Denmark by 4000 be (Jensen 1982) - presumably by over-hunting and other evidence of declining resources for hunting groups is available from NW Europe at this time. Dennell (1983) has also made the important point that the navigational and marine constructional skills necessary to allow the successful negotiation of the Channel obstacle would be unlikely to reside within the essentially terrestrial tradition of the European Early Neolithic (First Temperate - LBK - Rossen). Nevertheless, these skills were, as we know, present among coastal gathererhunter groups widely dispersed from Portugal to Denmark along the NW facade of Europe. Furthermore the evidence from sites in Britanny and in the Low Countries, as well as further to the N, indicates that such communities were adopting various and selected aspects of the new farming economy that was increasingly dominating the margins of their resource-base. Such adoption would have been natural enough. The procedures of successfully exploiting forest ungulates such as red deer, roe deer, aurochs and pig can have left these "hunters" no strangers to the business of animal



104 When Worlds Collide
husbandry. Indeed the increasing dependence of L.BK communities upon cattle as they moved into the NW may reflect their adoption and exploitation of this expertise. That the navagational pretensions of these groups was not merely coastal is witnessed by the deep sea species (hake, mackerel, saithe and cod) located in their midden deposits. In a seminal paper (Clark 1977), Graham Clark draws attention to the importance of fishing grounds to the movement of populations along the NW facade of Europe. He did this in (to the writer's mind) the less apposite context of the "spread" of megalithic construction. The burden of his argument, however, is closely related to our present train of thought. Mesolithic communities operating from bases on both sides of the channel would have inevitably come into contact pursuing the same shoals of fish. Furthermore, the rigors of the marine way of life would have dictated contact between groups in their base location (whether by foundering or misprision). Generations of such contact may well have built relationships of the kind that Caesar was to recognize 4000 years later. The transfer of subsistence innovation along the lines of these linkages within this peri-marine community is easy to imagine - a slow process and one by definition difficult to recognize in the archaeological record. Within Britain, however, the outcome is clear to see. We see the emergence of neolithic communities, generally speaking in the S of Britain within the very enclaves of country where the evidence indicates mesolithic communities to be most firmly established. Furthermore, the broad regional divisions within the S British neolithic (largely defined on ceramic typological grounds) closely reflect those of the succeeding mesolithic. This is all natural enough as both ways of life would have demanded the resources of light soils on the margins of the forest where hunting would have been richest and farming most easily accomplished. But what about the internal evidence for continuity within Britain? We have observed the broad continuity of culture provinces. Are there more specific elements of continuity? These are indeed few and far between and it is this element among others that has generated much support for the idea of direct neolithic colonization generally so unsupported in the "neolithic" evidence. In general terms however, the narrow-blade lithic industry of the earlier neolithic is a lineal successor to the mesolithic predecessor, and flint axes and scrapers (pace Whittle 1977) would appear to relate closely to mesolithic antecedents. Furthermore, as in N Europe, the exchange of raw materials for edge-tool manufacture seems to have clear origins within the mesolithic with both the specific exploitation of sources (Arran pitchstone, Rhum bloodstone, Portland chert, Group XIX rock in Cornwall) and the general dispersal patterns (Cornish rocks in use in mesolithic contexts in Hampshire and Sussex). Yet we clearly do see massive distinctions in the assemblages of mesolithic and neolithic communities. The vastly increased importance within assemblages of heavy edge-tools with neolithic is one major input, as well as, the advent, of course, of ceramics. Then, too, there is the abandonment of the whole tradition of microlithic armature manufacture and the substitution for it of bifacially worked single-piece heavyweight arrowhead manufacture. How, in the face of such material cultural disruption, can one argue coherently for continuity and acculturation in the way that I have? To the writer this problem is not an unduly daunting one. Once the process of husbandry is commenced, then the abandonment of hunting will be rapid and near-total



Mercer 105
as a less efficient activity in the context o f the farming settlement. However, hunting may well continue as a specialized or seasonal activity but almost certainly in isolation from a farming context and progressively governed within a farming regime. We know that, in Britain, coppicing of wood (implying the enclosure and deer/pig-proofing of tracts of woodland) and the control of red deer to allow the regulated and large scale supply of antler are both features of our early neolithic. The conception of forest as the foe of the farmer is an extraordinary notion unfamiliar to any farming society and certainly outside the experience of early farmers in Europe for whom woodland would have provided a range of indispensable resources from fuel and construction materials to alternative food resources. The increased dominance of edge tools in farming settlements is the natural sequitur of the activity conducted there, the common factor of the scraper is easily understood and the absence of the hunting arrow is absolutely in accord with the near absence of hunted animal bone on these sites where the record survives. The new leaf arrowhead, I shall argue in a short while, indicates yet another total socio-economic change just as the cultural discontinuities already mentioned do. This very cultural discontinuity, social, economic, psychological and environmental - probably the most demanding ever undertaken by man must have involved colossal conceptual adaptation which, in turn, must have been reflected in the linguistic construction and vocabularistic content of spoken communication. A whole new vocabulary involving hundreds of words would have been necessary - but perhaps more importantly, an apparatus of reasoning and argument would have become necessary to deal with the complexities of longterm investment, genetic management, enclosure measurement, labor quantification, species identification, and calendrical notation. A parallel may perhaps be broadly drawn with the circumstances, nearer our own time, consequent upon the Enlightenment and Industro-Agricultural "Revolution” of the eighteenth century AD which demanded and attained the lexicographical codification without which the precision necessary for the technological and intellectual trajectories that have been maintained ever since could not have been sustained. Much of this apparatus would have been derived from contexts quite outside the immediate system (like the now universal word diesel). Many would be adapted from existing vocabulary. No substantial immigrant population is seen to be necessary to this process and the writer has perhaps taken too long to demonstrate that in the rather dramatic case of Britain (in terms of the spread of farming in Europe) this can be strongly suggested not to have been the case. The economy established at this point remains essentially similar to that prevailing in Britain and indeed throughout N Europe for the remainder of prehistory. Its organization may have changed and perhaps the degree of its intensity but there is little indication of any substantial change in its technology or content until the eve of the Roman conquest. The ard and traction animals are present by 2800 be as are all the principal component crops (even oats are present at Bronocice in Poland in LBK contexts and at Balbridie, Grampian, Scotland, in the earlier third millennium be). The advent of metal would necessarily have involved a number of technical and descriptive terms hitherto not required but the development would have been minimal compared with that we have just described. If a vocabularistic and syntactical "revolution" is required in prehistory, then the advent of farming must provide a setting. Its implantation by force majeure is another matter - but this writer would argue that so



subject to political, psychological, institutional and military vagary is this notion that he is not convinced that the apparatus has yet been developed to link the engine of archaeology to the wheels of this argument in the pre-literate context. Before I move wildly beyond the boundaries of my competence, let me return to the British neolithic. We have seen that a "colonist" model for the inception of farming in Britain is unlikely in both "European" and "British” terms. Acculturation around the shores of a common fishing pond seems a more acceptable notion. How does this insular society of early farmers develop? We are still at an early stage of understanding these processes. Naturally enough, we have failed, by and large, to recognize and understand those marginally developed incipient farming communities that the proposed model demands. We do, however, through the abraded lens of archaeology see these societies quite clearly once they have become established. It is fascinating to record the phenomena that we observe by this stage. By 3200 be we observe the construction of vast monuments to the living within which the remains of the dead are incorporated. The idea proposed by Renfrew (1976) that link these monuments to the idea of "territorial signature" is both elegant and persuasive - and the explicit idea of land pressure that follows from this once again presupposes the long and scarcely recognized neolithic prologue demanded above. One of these great monuments involved an estimated 50,000 man-hours of constructional input at Fussell's Lodge (Ashbee 1966). Both probably at that site and certainly at Kilham in Yorkshire (Manby 1976), long histories of land-use prior to barrow erection involving at Kilham two separate phases of arable agriculture with periods of woodland recovery in between all prior to a date ante quem for the construction of the barrow of 2880.+ 125 be (BM-293). By this date other great stone-built chambered tombs were being constructed in geologically suitable areas of S. England - in some instances (West Kennet - Piggott 1963) involving prodigious expenditure of labor. At South Street, near Avebury (Ashbee et al 1979) a small, and apparently cenotaphic long barrow is dated post 2810 _+ 130 be (BM-356). Its clearly demonstrated lack of any trace of burial rite must add to our conception of the complexity of this monumental tradition probably only incidentally linked with the disposal of human dead. Certainly, both probably in terms of earthen long barrows (East Hesterton, Yorks) (Vatcher 1965), Hambledon Hill, Dorset - (Mercer 1980) and run on of stone-built chambered tombs (MidGleniron Farm, Wigtownshire - (Corcoran 1972, Dyffryn Ardudwy Merioneth - Powell 1973) and between earthen long barrows and stone-built chambered tombs (Waylands Smithy, Berks - Atkinson 1965) long sequences of development are visible on many sites. Recent work on the Cotswold-Sevem type tomb at Hazleton Glos (Saville et al. 1987) suggests that bodies were deposited in the two reaccessible chambers at this site over a period of time "perhaps considerably less than 300 years" around 2950-2700 be when 27-30 individuals in intact condition were cumulatively deposited in the two chambers of the tomb indicating a probable contributory and contemporarily living population of c.5 - a far smaller group than can conceivably have been responsible for the construction of the tomb (estimated time 16,000 man-hours - Startin 1982). Hazleton, like so many other barrows of this class, as well as earthen long barrows as far N as Yorkshire, displays internal "herring bone” subdivision of the mound which it has been suggested, performed the function of subdividing the mound into "bays” for

Mercer 107
construction purposes - a notion which might support the idea of contributory construction of the monument by a multi-originating local community. Further support to this idea is lent by detailed consideration of the land molluscan content of the long mound (admittedly not a long barrow sensu stricto but certainly a ceremonial monument) built over the destroyed causewayed enclosure at Crickley Hill, Glos (Dixon, pers. comm.) Here the profile of the molluscan population on neolithic land surface on this hilltop site is not replicated in the content of the mound (the snails within it reflect a range of different microenvironments some of which could only have been found a distance in excess of 3km.). The irresistible conclusion is that the material for the mound was brought in in discrete loads from a series of locations at some distance from the site - hinting again perhaps at contributory construction by a broadlybased population, for a central and commanding location which furthermore appears to have been most carefully sited at this location so as to be invisible to any but those standing closest to the monument with the suggestion even being that a screen was erected to reinforce this esotericism. Communal construction of monuments to which access was limited is perhaps most strikingly illustrated by the human bone record at the site at Lanhill, (Keiller and Piggott 1938) a chambered tomb in Berkshire of the Cotswold-Severn type where a series of skulls incorporated in the chamber each displayed a genetically transmitted irregularity - Wormian ossicles - that would very strongly suggest that the incumbent remains were members of one family or closely related group. If we could allow ourselves to amalgamate the evidence from these isolated locations in southern England (that all fall within a statistically indistinguishable radiocarbon bracket 3000-2800 be) we could then visualise a social structure in competitive crisis expressing territorial and other rights by monumentalization of lineage burial. Renfrew (1973) went so far as to suggest territorially defined chiefdoms on the basis of the subjective division of long barrow distribution in S England into a series of clusters focussing upon causewayed enclosures - the principal enclosure type functioning in Southern Britain. Let us now turn to the evidence that we have from this class of monument that has been subject to an extraordinary period of investigation and elucidation over the last decade or so. It was, of course Alexander Keiller who carried out the first large-scale scientific investigation of a causewayed enclosure in Britain - at Windmill Hill, N. Wilts. The site was in many ways typical of its class - a series of broadly concentric ditches interrupted by frequent narrow "causeways" at irregular intervals enclosing an eminence. The large quantity of material from the ditch deposits become the type assemblage for the earlier neolithic of S. Britain - the plain bowl neolithic formerly known as the Windmill Hill Culture. Since 1930 we have expanded our understanding of the distribution and nature of these enclosures and others relating to this date. Over fifty causewayed enclosures are now known throughout S. Britain. Many are situated on low eminences on the terraces of river valleys - sometimes the circuits of ditches are not complete but the sites appear to be promontory enclosures with the interrupted ditches cutting off only the aspect of easy approach. Indeed, since 1970 we have become aware of hilltop stone-walled enclosures of this date in Cornwall in areas of granite bedrock where ditch digging would have been quite impossible.



108 When Worlds Collide
Indeed, the ditch digging appears to have been a quarrying operation to obtain the raw material for the construction of a continuous bank - a fundamental consideration that appears to account for the irregular and "interrupted" nature of these ditches. Nevertheless, having been dug, the ditch very regularly becomes the focus on these sites for deposits of cultural material and bone that can only be considered as deliberate and of a ceremonial nature. In the early 1930s Dorothy Liddell (1930 -35) embarked upon the excavation of a later prehistoric hillfort at Hembury, Devon. She encountered a previously unsuspected causewayed enclosure which was to become the type-site for the SW faces of the British earlier neolithic. Hembury was a promontory enclosure which unlike Windmill Hill produced evidence that its interior had been the focus of intensive occupation linked to radiocarbon dates ranging from 3200 - 3000 be. Liddell was prevented by ill-health from producing a full report but inspection of her records makes it clear that this settlement was a focus of wide-ranging contacts for exchanges of raw materials and products. Axes of Cornish rock from the St. Ives/Camborne area, chert from Dorset, flint from further E and pottery from Cornwall were being moved along an E-W route astride which Hembury clearly sat. Perhaps more important in the present context is the fact that the obvious prosperity of this site was apparently terminated by widespread burning. The timber- and hurdling-faced rampart was set ablaze and the body of the rampart destabilized by the disruption of its forward revetment which collapsed forward into the ditch - the heat of the burning material scorching the green sand to a wine-red color. In association with this burning, 150 leaf arrowheads were located with a notable concentration around the gateway through the rampart leading to the site. One swallow does not make a summer, and it was not until the 1970s that we were able to place the Hembury evidence in any wider sort of context. In 1970, the writer commenced excavations at Carn Brea (Mercer 1981) near Redruth in Cornwall a site that proved to be a one hectare enclosure defined by a stone rampart built of mighty blocks of granite. The enclosure was in turn confined within an outer enceinte of five hectares which comprised a mighty ditched rampart - stone-faced - with complex gateways clearly constructed with a view to defense in depth. The Carn Brea one hectare enclosure was, like Hembury, a settlement site with houses built on terraces within the rocky interior. It too participated in the E-W exchange network to which Hembury subscribed. It apparently commanded the "Group XVI" axe source ("near Camborne") and axe polishers as well as numerous products manufactured from rock from this source were located on the site. Flint and chert from at least five different sources were located which must emanate from distances in excess of 150 kms to the E. Moreover the evidence of petrological analysis would suggest that all vessels in use on the site (with over 500 represented in the excavated sample) were imported from a manufactory set 25 kms to the S in the Lizard peninsula. Radiocarbon dates suggest that the site was in use between 3000-2700 be, but that once again its obvious prosperity was terminated by savage destruction. Evidence for burning is ubiquitous on the site, there is evidence that the great stone wall was deliberately slighted and over 700 leaf shaped arrowheads were found (again in the excavated sample) with a substantial concentration near the entrance to the site.



Mercer 109
While work was in progress at Cara Brea, Philip Dixon, like Liddell, was beginning to explore a hitherto unknown causewayed enclosure sealed beneath a later prehistoric hillfort at Crickley Hill in Gloucestershire. The resulting picture of the development of an enclosure of this type is of enormous complexity that can only briefly be summarized here. Although sited on a most dramatic promontory on the scarp edge of the Cotswolds just above Cheltenham, the site in fact comprises two broadly concentric circuits of ditch forming a sequence of development in which the basic unit would appear to be the causewayed ditch in front of a low platform 8m in breadth at the rear edge of which is a palisade - seemingly a "distancing" exercise to create an effective "killing ground." This scheme of defence is reconstructed on at least five occasions developing progressively in complexity. Probably one of the phases of reconstruction follows an attack in which archers played a prominent role. In the final phase for which, in the nature of things, the clearest picture survives, the site interior is occupied by a planned settlement of rectangular houses (at least fifteen existed on the site) set on either side of cobbled roadways leading into the site from timber-framed entrances. This final enclosure phase was brought to an end in a veritable holocaust of burning and arrowshot with two or three hundred arrowheads found clustered in the entrance and along the palisade line. This destruction phase, as at Hembury and at Carn Brea, sees the end of settlement on the site - only to be followed by the construction of the long mound in its final phases referred to above. We are of course puzzled by one difficulty in relation to these traces of warfare. At Hembury, Cara Brea and Crickley the subsoil on the sites does not support bone. Evidence of economy is therefore hard to come by and furthermore evidence of death among humans is difficult to demonstrate. To what extend therefore is this "warfare" a ceremonial demonstration - an act of theater. We must be wary of veneering our ethnocentric view of warfare onto past societies the values of which we know next to nothing. To some extent, in the British context, the answer may lie with the evidence from the last site we shall consider in this context - Hambledon Hill in Dorset (Mercer 1980). This site, excavated by the writer between 1974 and 1986, comprises a causewayed enclosure complex site at least two and probably three integral enclosures set within a massive defensive outwork system. At the focus of the whole system is the 9 hectare single ditched enclosure on the crown of this great island hill set just to the W of Cranborae Chase. Large-scale excavation indicated that this enclosure was a necropolis center for the excarnation of the dead. It seems likely that in some instances deposits of cadaveric material were accompanied by offerings placed in pits, these offerings comprising objects of apparently prestigious nature. Here we meet at the other end of the E-W route running through SW England and, as mentioned earlier, gabbroic pottery 270 kms from its source, axes of N Cornish origin, jadeite axes from Britanny and large quantities of shed red deer antler - positively scarce elsewhere on the site. The dates attached to this enclosure and indeed to the whole complex range from 2900-2600 be. The evidence for excaraation resides in large quantities of human bone either wholly or partly disarticulated located either deliberately placed or accidentally incorporated in the ditch on the enclosure. Skulls are prominently selected and placed on the ditch floor along with deposits which seem to be the remains of feasting - the conspicuously uneconomic consumption of meat, mostly beef. The



110 When Worlds Collide
recovered human remains represents a minimum of eighty individuals suggesting on the basis of the site sample a total of some 500 parts of individuals either accidentally (or in some cases their skulls) deliberately incorporated within the ditch filling. Of this population, in contradistinction to the long barrow population discussed above, the male/female balance is even and 60% of the individuals recorded are children or early adolescents. Associated with this extraordinary necropolis site is a smaller enclosure of apparently domestic function - the whole surrounded by a mighty outwork system of triple chalk-built and timber-framed ramparts involving the use of many thousands of timber beams. Eventually, like Carn Brea and Crickley, the site was destroyed in a mighty conflagration but at Hambledon the preservative qualities of the chalk bedrock has led to the preservation of five intact skeletons of individuals apparently killed during this episode - one of whom indeed had one of the distinctive leaf arrowheads embedded in his chest. However ceremonialized the warfare that we are glimpsing, its consequences were unpleasant enough for at least some of its participants - all of them, at Hambledon, robust young males. As one of a relatively small group of archaeologists present at Bellagio in February of 1988,1 was privileged to learn a very great deal about an area of study with which most archaeologists fail to come to terms. Language as the most pervasive and flexible of human artefacts has however the crushing drawback that it cannot survive independently in the archaeological record. Can, however, this sketched account of the early neolithic of Britain and the development of warfare have much to offer by way of understanding for the palaeo-linguist? I think it may seek to clarify the limitation to any close harnessing of our two disciplines. We have seen that the exigency of fundamental economic change in N and W Europe may well have led to the adoption by degrees of new economic practices without necessarily any major ethnic movement. Certainly there is no evidence for such movement and the clear separation to be noted between the European evidence and that from Britain might hint that the reverse is true. Thus we are faced with the sui generis production of a highly organized farming community on the basis of hunting/fishing communities under stress and intercommunicating around the land locked seas of NW Europe. Along these lines of communication moved materials quite foreign to these indigenous communities (cereals, sheep/goats in material terms but, probably, and vastly more significantly, a prodigious array of conceptual innovations which almost certainly would have demanded vocabularistic and syntactical innovation). The precise nature and source of this likely innovation is not, and almost certainly never will be, known to us. From these lowly but complex origins we see the independent, unmatched development in Britain of highly competitive pressurized societies within which (to be highly selective) warfare, fortification, cranial cult, axe-ritual, dairyoriented economy, ox-traction ploughing and a number of other features that might be expected to be "at home" in an Urheimat all played a recognizable role. All this was established here by 3000 be - and recently the Zvelebils (this volume) have suggested that it may be in concert with conceptual changes aligned with Sherratt's Secondary Products Revolution (of which traction and milking are the principal early components) that Indo-European languages were introduced to NW Europe between 4000-3000 be in a series of radiating "ripples" (Sherratt 1988) though Sherratt would not go so far as to



Mercer 1 1 1
call Britain into that pool at so early a date. Certainly if we reject the period before 3000 be with its registered innovation, enhanced contact and consequent tension as the period of proto-Indo-European linguistic introduction in N and W Europe, then we have to wait at least another millennium and half until after 2000 be for far less persuasive archaeological disjunctives to perhaps signal an appropriate period for linguistic introduction. The writer suspects that the organizers' inclusion of a consideration of prehistoric warfare in the Bellagio symposium may have had little to do with the above comments. The writer also suspects that language is spread by people talking to each other, not fighting each other - all the more so if they had something absolutely new and very exciting to talk about.

Astronomical and geometrical influences on
monumental design: clues to changing patterns
of social tradition?
Clive Ruggles, University of Leicester, U.K.
Abstract
When applied with due caution and with due regard to the archaeological and cultural context, statistical studies of design features of Neolithic field
monuments, such as shape and orientation, and of the relationship of such design features to the surrounding landscape and skyscape, can be of considerable interest in shedding light on changing patterns of social tradition. This is especially the case when applied to groups of sites, such as the small rings and alignments of standing stones found in abundance in northern and western parts of the British Isles, which yield little in the way of stratigraphical
and artefactual evidence.
This paper attempts a critical overview of some recent results from this type of approach, with particular reference to astronomical and geometrical practices as evidenced by their influence on monumental design. It then sets out to draw some tentative conclusions about changing patterns of social tradition, and their relationship to social structure, during the third and second millennia be. Particular reference is made to the British Isles, but mention is also made of related work in other parts of western Europe.
1 Introduction
The study of the design of Neolithic field monuments in western Europe has
evolved very differently in different contexts. Thus investigations of the architectural design of large megalithic tombs have long been established in the mainstream of western European archaeology; on the other hand studies of the



116 When Worlds Collide
shape and design of smaller megalithic sites, such as the small rings and short
alignments of standing stones found in abundance in northern and western parts of the British Isles, were until relatively recently confined to the domain of
astronomers, engineers and statisticians, and were confused in the minds of many archaeologists (e.g. Daniel 1980) with the activities of the ‘lunatic fringe’ who had been much attracted to megalithic monuments in the 1960s and 1970s. A history of lack of communication and understanding across the ‘cultural divide’ has given rise to some very anomalous attitudes to different studies of monumental design in its cultural context, which obscure much work of interest which has taken place during the last five to ten years.
Prior to the methodological revolutions of the 1970s, investigations of the
design of prehistoric monumental sites were epitomised by studies such as
those of megalithic chambered tombs in western Europe which concentrated
upon the classification of structural elements in the tomb architecture and upon typological sequencing based upon these (e.g. Daniel 1958; Powell 1969). The quest for explanatory models in the 1970s has led to considerations of field monuments in relation to the surrounding landscape, natural and cultural. A recent example of this approach is the work of Fraser (1983) on the chambered
cairns of Orkney. The present decade has also seen the emergence of various approaches to explore more direct relationships between monumental design
and social practice and structure. Thomas (1988), for example, studies changes
in the design of the Cotswold-Sevem Tombs in relation to changes in mortuary practice, concluding that the past was manipulated and recreated in order to support social change. In studies of shape and design Hillier & Hanson’s (1984) analysis of the relationships between social and spatial order has been influential.
Concurrently with this development, and in relative isolation, investigations have proceeded of the smaller megalithic sites, most of which yield little in the way of stratigraphical and artefactual evidence. Amongst the many possible factors influencing the design and placement of a such a monument, astronomical ones have, it may seem, received far more than their due share of attention. This situation has arisen partly for historical reasons—for two centuries individuals had sporadically become fascinated by the idea that there might have been an astronomical significance in many prehistoric monuments, with eminent astronomers occasionally backing up such speculations with accurate measurements (e.g. Lockyer 1909); partly because of the huge popular interest aroused by Gerald Hawkins’ Stonehenge Decoded (Hawkins & White 1965); and lastly because of the influence of the work of Alexander Thom



Ruggles 117
(Thom 1967; 1971; Thom & Thom 1978a). Independently of his mainstream
academic career as an engineer, Thom developed a deep and active interest in the prehistoric megalithic sites of Britain and Brittany, surveying many hundreds of them between the 1930s and the 1970s. Astronomy was one of his three areas of interest, the others being mensuration (the possible use of ‘standard’ units of measurement in setting out megalithic rings and rows), and geometry (the methods used to set out the rings, many of winch are markedly non-circular).
These three lines of enquiry—mensuration, geometry and astronomy—form the legacy of so-called ‘megalithic science’. The term derives from the title of a book by Heggie (1981). Subtitled ‘Ancient mathematics and astronomy in northwest Europe’, although confined almost exclusively to the British Isles and Brittany, the book sets out to review, from the point of view of a mathematician and astronomer, the evidence in the three areas. Heggie was perhaps the first person from this side of the ‘cultural divide’ to cast a critical eye upon the theories generated by his colleagues in the numerate disciplines.
Criticisms had been forthcoming from archaeologists for a good deal longer. Indeed, the term ‘megalithic science’ is still an immotive one, redolent of
scientists and engineers proceeding with considerable but misguided enthusiasm
in the pursuit of evidence of prehistoric protoscience while paying rather too little attention to matters of archaeological and social context. For example, almost all the attention was focussed upon spectacular and relatively wellpreserved field monuments: alignments along and between standing stones are easily picked out, and can easily be imagined to be ‘indicating’ something. The idea that such alignments indicated horizon astronomical events has dominated investigations of prehistoric astronomy, almost to the exclusion of any others. As megalithic science rose to become a vigorous field of enquiry as well as one attracting considerable popular interest, there was much talk of a ‘megalithic
culture’ harbouring a hitherto unexpected astronomical and geometrical expertise: ‘Megalithic Man’, according to Thom (1971: ch. 1), was a competent engineer, had an extensive knowledge of practical geometry, and studied the movements of the sun and moon in great detail. The ethnocentrism inherent in such discussions is manifest. Unfortunately, however, because of this many have simply dismissed all aspects of Thom’s work, and that of others in ‘megalithic science’, without any further consideration of the quantitative arguments and raw field evidence.



118 When Worlds Collide
Some authors, however, have attempted to bridge the divide. Burl, for example, has considered results from Thom’s fieldwork within a range of more conventional archaeological evidence in various publications on megalithic rings (e.g. Burl 1976; 1980; 1981a; 1983; 1987; 1988). The present author has proceeded from critiques of Thom’s work (Ruggles 1981a; 1982a; 1983) to the consideration of the astronomical significance of certain groups of monuments within an approach which attempts to combine statistical rigour with less formal reasoning based on the archaeological context (Ruggles 1984a; 1984b; 1985a; Ruggles & Burl 1985; Ruggles 1988b). Factors such as astronomical significance and/or geometrical design are increasingly being considered within more conventional archaeological investigations, Fraser’s work (1983) being a case in point.
This paper attempts to review some recent results in areas of investigation deriving from those in ‘megalithic science’, i.e. regarding astronomical and geometrical practices as evidenced by their influence on monumental design. Most of the work described relates to British sites, although recently some interesting investigations have emerged in other parts of Europe. The final
section of this paper attempts to draw some tentative conclusions about
changing patterns of social tradition, and their relationship to social structure.
2 Orientation and astronomy in late Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain
2.1 Astronomy and the material record
The claim that astronomical observations, even of some considerable sophistication, might have been made by various groups in prehistoric Europe is scarcely highly controversial in itself. The movements of the heavenly bodies are of almost universal concern, even amongst the most technologically primitive of hunter-gatherer societies (see, e.g., Thorpe 1981; Chamberlain et al. 1989). Many instances are known of careful and precise astronomical observations amongst relatively simple societies, such as the much-quoted example of the Hopi Indians, an essentially egalitarian society with no centralised political organisation, yet with an elaborate ceremonial calendar



Ruggles 119
regulated by carefully tracking the horizon rising position of the sun from fixed points on the ground (Renfrew 1973; McCluskey 1977).
The difficulty is in extracting direct evidence for astronomical practice from the material record, and in its interpretation. Many aspects of celestial lore and observations of astronomical bodies, well known from ethnographic examples world-wide, may simply leave no direct trace in the material record. An obvious example is the naming and observations of constellations. Some activities might give rise to particular artefacts (for example, the counting off of months by observing the phases of the moon, a very widespread activity, might leave its trace in the form of tally sticks) but have no direct influence on ceremonial architecture since the observation can be made from any position with a clear view of the sky.
Even where astronomical influences on monumental architecture are demonstrable, interpretations are likely to be complex. With perhaps the Hopi example in mind, calendar regulation is often quoted as a motivation for monumental orientations in the direction of sunrise or sunset at particular times of the year. However, even where sunrise observations are made from particular spots for this purpose, it does not follow that there is a necessity to erect markers of any great permanence at these positions or to orient them
towards the horizon in question (indeed, the Hopi do not; and in many cases a natural object such as a boulder or tree suffices as a marker (e.g. Turton &
Ruggles 1978)). It is also misleading to imply that a reasonably accurate
agricultural or ceremonial calendar can only be regulated by keeping track of the horizon rising or setting position of the sun: it can be done perfectly adequately, as in many other known cases, by means of observations of the heliacal rising or setting of stars (Ruggles 1981b)—observations which do not have to made from particular spots on the ground—as well as by indirect and composite methods, for example combining observations of a variety of astronomical events with observations of a range of other natural phenomena. Such methods, although seeming haphazard to ourselves, may work perfectly adequately within the framework of the society in question (Turton & Ruggles 1978).
Finally we must consider at the outset how, given a set of data such as the orientations of a group of field monuments, one assesses the nature of the astronomical observations (if any) that influenced those orientations. It is clear
that any individual alignment of apparent astronomical significance could have arisen through factors quite unrelated to astronomy. There needs to be some attempt to demonstrate the intentionality of putative astronomical alignments.



120 When Worlds Collide
One way is through the statistical analysis of as large as possible a set of data, whereby it may be demonstrable that certain astronomical alignments are
significantly more common than would have been expected by chance. This approach has the advantage that unavoidable errors and uncertainties, such as the difference between the present disposition of the material remains and that intended by the builders, will merely add to the background ‘random noise’. Since, however, a large number of factors may have influenced monumental design and orientation, great care is needed in drawing inferences, even when trends of apparent astronomical significance are encountered. One must check whether factors unrelated to astronomy could equally well account for the orientation pattern observed. The present author (Ruggles 1981c; 1982b) has considered this point in some detail, suggesting a methodology for studying orientations which is followed in later work:.
One must of course also bear in mind the complexities of the material record and the limitations of a statistical approach of this sort. In particular, one can only hope to isolate general trends at reasonably large groups of sites. For this reason this author feels that statistical rigour must be combined with interpretative reasoning in a well-structured way. Results of some interest have been emerging recently through such an approach (Ruggles 1988b).
2 .2 Technical background
The key concept in the consideration of putative astronomical alignments is that
of declination (Thom 1967: ch. 3; Ruggles 1984a: Appendix I). At each site, any range of horizon ‘indicated’ by a structure orientation can be defined in terms of declination. Declination is a function of azimuth, horizon altitude, and the latitude of the observer (the effects of astronomical refraction must also be taken into account). From the declination one can deduce the celestial bodies that will rise or set at the point indicated, and those that would have done so at
any past era.
We can regard all the heavenly bodies—sun, moon, planets and stars—as
positioned on a ‘celestial sphere’ surrounding the earth. From any position on the earth at a particular time we can observe the half of the celestial sphere which is above our horizon, as in a planetarium. The earth rotates once daily
inside the celestial sphere; thus if we regard the earth as fixed, the celestial sphere rotates once daily with all the heavenly bodies affixed to it. On this



Ruggles 1 2 1
rotating celestial sphere we can identify a north and south pole (the ‘celestial poles’), an equator (the ‘celestial equator’), and lines of (‘celestial’) latitude and longitude. Declination is simply a synonym for celestial latitude. The celestial equator is the line where the declination is 0°. By convention, declinations north of the celestial equator are positive and those to the south negative. All the heavenly bodies move daily around lines of constant declination: thus the Pleiades have a declination of about +24° and Polaris, which is very near to the north celestial pole, has a declination of about +89°. The declinations of stars change gradually on a timescale of centuries owing to a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes.
The sun, moon and planets move slowly about on the celestial sphere as it
rotates. The result for the sun is that its declination varies annually between about +23°.5 at the June solstice and -23°.5 at the December solstice, in a
sinusoidal manner. The motions of the moon are more complicated. The moon’s declination varies rapidly, moving between northerly and southerly limits once a month. These monthly limits themselves vary over a period of 18-6 years. Thus at one point in the 18-6-year cycle the moon’s declination will be varying each month between limits of about +18° and -20°; a little over nine
years later these monthly limits will have expanded to about +28° and -30°; and after another nine years they will have contracted back to +18° and -20°. The
maximum northerly and southerly limits of the moon’s monthly motions are
sometimes known, following Thom (1971: 18), as the ‘major standstill’
declinations, and the minimum limits as the ‘minor standstill’ declinations. This terminology will be used here, although it must be remembered that the declination of the moon itself continues to vary rapidly day by day at all times.
The limits of variation of the sun and moon, the solar solstitial and lunar standstill declinations, are unaffected over the centuries by the precession of the equinoxes, but they do change noticeably over a timescale of millennia. Since 2000 BC they have changed by about 0°.5, an amount roughly equal to the width of the solar or lunar disc.
2 .3 The legacy of ‘m egalithic astronom y’
‘Megalithic astronomy’, a term much used in the 1960s and 1970s, concerned itself almost exclusively with the possible alignment of structures upon the horizon rising and setting positions of certain celestial bodies. In its heyday the



122 When Worlds Collide
megalithic astronomy debate was dominated by arguments about the interpretation of a few individual sites. There are many pitfalls in lavishing so much attention on so few sites (Ruggles 1984c), especially where independent archaeological evidence relating to the astronomical hypothesis is either absent or ignored.
The passage grave at Newgrange is perhaps the least contentious example of a monument incorporating an astronomical alignment to emerge from these debates. O’Kelly’s excavations and restorations (O’Kelly 1971) revealed a mysterious ‘roof-box’ above the entrance which would have continued to admit light into the interior after the entrance itself was sealed. O’Kelly’s own observations, followed up by a survey by Patrick (1974), established that the sun’s rays enter the roof-box, penetrate the entire length of the passage and illuminate the central chamberjust after sunrise for a few days on either side of the winter solstice, and would have done so since the erection of the tomb somewhat before 3000 BC. Given that south-easterly orientations are quite common amongst passage graves, and may be favoured for other reasons, the probability of a chance solstitial alignment is appreciably high; however the presence of the roof-box (not readily explicable otherwise) in just the right
position for the shaft of light to penetrate the entire passage has made its intentionality almost universally accepted. The alignment was clearly not for the
use of living astronomers.
The interpretation of most of the other ‘classic’ sites of megalithic astronomy is much more contentious; indeed, it seems fair to say that they merely illustrate the dangers of attempting an astronomical interpretation of individual sites in isolation from their wider archaeological context. The long debate concerning the three-stone row at Ballochroy in Kintyre, Scotland (MacKie 1974; Bailey et al. 1975; Burl 1979: 66; Patrick 1981), hailed as a high-precision solar ‘observatory’ by Thom (1971: 36), illustrates clearly that such debates can never be satisfactorily resolved on their own merits (Ruggles 1984c). A detailed and balanced appraisal of the various astronomical theories concerning Stonehenge has been given by Heggie (1981); it seems that the only reasonably uncontentious statement that can be made here is that the general orientation of the axis of the monument at various stages in its development is towards midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset (a precision in azimuth of at best a degree or two of arc is involved), and that this may well have been deliberate. Burl (1987), however, has recently taken the archaeological and astronomical
argument further (see below). Even where, as at Kintraw in Argyll, there is an opportunity to test an astronomical hypothesis by archaeological means—an



Ruggles 123
excavation was undertaken by MacKie (1974) to test an astronomical theory of Thom (1969) by determining whether a ledge on a putative astronomical alignment was artificial—the results can be inconclusive, as MacKie himself now concedes they were at this site (MacKie et al. 1985). Burl (1981a) has pointed out some poignant examples where seemingly convincing astronomical alignments are present at individual sites, but when these sites are seen as part of an archaeological group the trend is not repeated and the alignment then appears to have come about by chance.
In contrast to these discussions of individual sites, arguably the most important evidence presented over the years by Thom arose from analyses of groups of sites taken together. The evidence is cumulative in nature: four distinct ‘Levels’ were identified by the present author (Ruggles 1981a). At each Level the evidence consists essentially of one or more analyses of many putative ‘indications’, and at each Level the degree of precision of indication being tested is greater than at previous Levels. At Level 1most indications consist simply of a part of the horizon in line with an oriented structure. Some, however, achieve
greater precision by making use of natural foresights, such as notches between hills on distant horizons. In the later Levels all indications are of the ‘indicated foresight’ type.
It is worth commenting on the later Levels first. These concentrate upon lunar sightlines, which Thom claimed were set up to a precision of no more than two
or three (Thom 1971), and later no more than one or two (Thom & Thom 1978b; 1980; A.S. Thom 1981) minutes of arc (the diameter of the sun or moon’s disc is roughly 30 arc minutes, or half a degree). One is forced to conclude that meticulous observing programmes were carried out lasting up to 180 years (A.S. Thom 1981: 38). A number of authors have challenged these conclusions at their various stages, claiming for example that data selection decisions made by Thom are not justifiable on a priori grounds, and that lunar observations of the precision claimed are simply not feasible in practice (Heggie 1972; McCreery 1980; EllegSrd 1981). Comprehensive critiques by the present author, based on archaeological reappraisals and remeasurements in the field (Ruggles 1981a; 1982a; 1983; see also Ruggles 1984c for a summary), concluded that the evidence is overwhelmingly against deliberate lunar indications of very high precision.
However such conclusions do not extend to the earlier stages (Level 1) of Thom’s work. Here (Thom 1967) he measured 262 putative indications at 145 sites. On the basis of cumulative histograms of the resulting declinations, and



124 When Worlds Collide
associated statistical tests, he suggested the existence of deliberate solar, lunar and stellar alignments set up to a precision of about half a degree. The solar alignments comprise the solstices, equinoxes and intermediate declinations representing equal divisions of the year into eight and possibly 16 parts. The lunar alignments are upon the four major and minor standstill declinations. The latter alignments imply that co-ordinated observing programmes lasted up to 18 years.
These conclusions should not necessarily be taken at face value. Moir et al. (1980) and Moir (1981) have drawn attention to the great variety of types of site, geographical location and methods of indication found in Thom’s data. Moir has also highlighted several sites where archaeological evidence makes the
proposed astronomical interpretation particularly doubtful. The present author has questioned Thom’s criteria for selecting candidate indications, and drawn
attention to other problems such as the confusion of hypotheses (Ruggles 1984a; 1984c). On the other hand, Thom’s conclusions at this level cannot
simply be dismissed; it is important to see whether, when the selection criteria are clarified and the other criticisms satisfied, statistical evidence still remains to suuport any of the categories of astronomical, alignment claimed by Thom.
An extensive independent survey of megalithic sites in western Scotland was conducted between 1975 and 1981 under severe methodological constraints (Ruggles 1984a). For example, in selecting sites and structures for consideration, rigorous pre-defined criteria were adhered to. No survey data
were reduced until the entire sample had been collected, in order to avoid the possibility of the selection strategy being influenced by the results obtained along the way.
Indicated declinations were found to manifest overall trends at three levels of
precision.
(1) At the lowest level, declinations between about -15° and +15° are strongly avoided. This trend reflects an extremely strong preference for structures to be oriented in the N-S, rather than the E-W, quadrants (Patrick &
Freeman 1988).
(2) At the second level, there is a marked preference for southern declinations
between -31° and -19°. This declination range is of particular interest because it represents, to within a degree or so, the range of possible values of the



Ruggles 125
southerly limit of the moon’s monthly motions at different points in the 18.6-year cycle. A distribution over this range would be expected if sites
were oriented upon the most southerly rising or setting position of the moon each month, without recognition of the gradual change of this limit over the longer cycle.
(3) At the most precise level, there is marginal evidence of a preference for six particular declination values to within a precision of one or two degrees: -30°, -25°, -22°.5, +18°, +27° and +33°. Three of them (-30°, +18° and +27°) may indicate a specific interest in the lunar standstills, and would imply that the eighteen-year cycle was recognised. Another (-25°)
may indicate an interest in the winter solstice. The others have no particular solar or lunar significance.
Thus although there is clear evidence of lunar orientation, and marginal evidence of orientation upon the winter solstice, there is no evidence whatsoever for an interest in the summer solstice or equinoxes (indeed, declinations in the vicinity of the equinoxes are strongly avoided) and no support for Thom’s calendar. Nor is there any evidence of astronomical orientations of a precision greater than about one degree.
Certain coherent groups of sites are found to feature predominantly amongst the
indications falling in particular ‘preferred’ declination intervals. Most interestingly, a well-defined group of sites in Mull and mainland Argyll,
consisting of up to five standing stones in a row, are all without exception oriented in the south upon a declination between -31° and -19°.
2 .4 ‘Science or cerem onial?’
A further legacy of the conflict between the ‘megalithic science’ approach and the mainstream archaeological approach should be mentioned here. This is the protracted discussion as to whether astronomical practice in late Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain was ‘scientific’ or ‘ceremonial’ in nature. Strongly on the side of ‘scientific’ astronomy are, for example, Thom (1967; 1971; Thom & Thom 1978a) and MacKie (1981; MacKie et al. 1985); in the other camp are authors such as Burl (1980; 1981a; 1983), Moir (1981), EllegSrd (1981), Bamatt & Pierpoint (1983) and Fraser (1984).



126 When Worlds Collide
Many of these authors derive support for their view from independent archaeological evidence, but there is a strong tendency to interpret evidence in favour high-precision astronomical observations as evidence in favour of ‘scientific’ astronomy and evidence in favour of low-precision observations as evidence in favour of ‘ceremonial’ astronomy. This is not a correlation that can be taken for granted. Indeed, the rigid dichotomy between science and ceremonial is undoubtedly misleading; we need to consider first the existence and precision of intentional orientations, astronomical and otherwise, and then to interpret them using far more than two crude (and actually rather vaguelydefined) categories. As Renfrew (1981) has pointed out, to insist on such a
rigid and ultimately subjective dichotomy between science and non-science serves only to obscure the nature of what surely ranks as an interesting development in the evolution of scientific thought.
This author has expressed the view (Ruggles 1984a; 1984c) that we should first examine the dispositional evidence with a view to questions such as (i) how important an influence were astronomical considerations upon the placement and design of a site? and (ii) what was the precision of any astronomical observations made? Then, given conclusions based upon statistical examinations of the evidence, we can consider astronomical observations in their social context alongside the other strands of archaeological evidence at our
disposal. The two remaining parts of this section examine recent work, attempting to separate the two stages in this progress.
2 .5 Astronomy as a factor in site placement and orientation
In recent years a number of investigations have been undertaken in which astronomy is considered as merely one of a number of possible factors influencing site placement and orientation. They have started to uncover evidence that astronomical considerations were indeed a factor influencing the siting and design of a variety of different types of monument at different times
in British prehistory.
Fraser (1983) has attempted to draw together many lines of evidence relating to the people who inhabited Orkney during the third and second millennia be and the land on which they lived. His main source of data is the Orkney chambered cairns: their architectural form, their relationship to other material evidence



Ruggles 127
(other monuments, artefacts and burial evidence), and their spatial relationships. He concludes that that the Neolithic inhabitants of Orkney situated their chambered cairns in places which were chosen so as to make certain solar observations possible. These observations could have been of importance to a farming people in signalling significant times in the agricultural year.
Bamatt & Pierpoint (1983) have studied the group of stone circles at Machrie
Moor on Arran for evidence of astronomical observations using horizon foresights, but without structures on the ground being oriented upon the
foresights in question. The area has a large concentration of monuments including six stone circles of various designs, three chambered tombs and over twenty round houses, together with associated clearance cairns and field walls. The authors’ approach is to detect those areas on the ground from which certain astronomical events—the solar solstices and lunar standstills—would have been observable in particular horizon notches, and to see whether the placement of sites favours locations where a good many such events would have been visible. They conclude that the stone circles on Machrie Moor were placed at optimally prominent locations, in strong contrast to the other types of site on the moor. Furthermore, five out of the seven circles occupy areas from which at
least two astronomical events can be seen, although these areas only make up
some 27% of the total. The authors conclude that there is a distinct bias in the siting of stone circles for locations favourable to astronomical observation.
Ruggles (1984b) and Ruggles & Burl (1985) have studied the Recumbent Stone Circles (RSCs) of eastern Scotland. These are a well-defined group of about 100 known sites. They comprise a ring of standing stones including a single recumbent stone flanked by two uprights (Burl 1976). Dating evidence, including radiocarbon dates of around 1400bc from one of the sites, Berrybrae, suggest that the group as a whole belong to the earlier and middle part of the second millennium be.
Certain general trends are evident in the placement and design of these monuments. They were, for example, always placed in conspicuous settings, often on artifically levelled sites. The direction from the centre of the ring to the centre of the recumbent stone is in every case without exception oriented within the horizon quadrant centred upon SSW. The horizon behind the recumbent stone is, again without exception, non-local. The top of the recumbent appears always to have lain below the horizon, while the flankers usually projected above it, seemingly to demarcate a stretch of horizon.



128 When Worlds Collide
There was a clear tendency to orient the recumbent stone upon the major or minor standstill moon in the south, although no great precision was involved. However this was not universal: there is evidence of other (possibly conflicting) concerns, such as the presence of conspicuous hilltops within the horizon above the recumbent stone, and placing the recumbent stone due south of the ring centre. There is also evidence that cupmarked stones were placed so as to
indicate the major or minor standstill moon as seen from the ring centre. These separate goals would rarely have been achievable simultaneously, and the authors surmise that compromises were reached.
Since they were singled out by the wider-based earlier survey (Ruggles 1984a) described above, further studies have proceeded of the rows of up to five stones
found predominatly in two geographical concentrations in western ScotlandArgyll (centring upon the Rilmartin area) and northern Mull. On the basis of new evidence (Ruggles 1985a; 1988b) the southern declinations indicated by the stone rows and aligned pairs seem to fit a clear pattern. Either they are oriented within about a degree of -30°, or else they are oriented within a degree
or two of -24° and situated close to another row or pair which does indicate -30°.
The primary orientations around -30° appear to present particularly strong
evidence of deliberate orientation upon the southern major standstill moon. It should be noted, however, that because of the low precision of these alignments there is no necessity to postulate (pace Thom) strictly regulated nightly observations of the moon at certain critical times in the 18.6-year cycle. Simple observations, e.g. of the rising or setting of the full moon nearest to the summer solstice, would suffice. There is no clear-cut explanation for the secondary
orientations: they may have been upon the moon’s southerly monthly limit at another point in the 18.6-year cycle, but it is also possible that they were upon the midwinter sun. On the basis of the evidence currently available the two possibilities seem indistinguishable.
A survey and excavation project has been running in northern Mull since 1986 (Ruggles & Martlew, in preparation). The fieldwork has shown that a reconstructed setting of standing stones at Glengorm in the far north of the island was originally a three-stone row oriented in the south upon Ben More, the highest mountain on Mull and a prominent distant horizon feature, and a
nearer hill, Beinn na Drise, to its right. The peak of Ben More yields a
declination of -29°; that of Beinn na Drise -30°. Thus the site follows the pattern of primary orientation upon the southern standstill moon, with the added feature



Ruggles 129
of two prominent hills on the horizon at this point. There is also evidence from pollen cores of a relatively sudden phase of forest clearance broadly around the
time of construction of the site. Further dating evidence is being sought in an attempt to investigate further the closeness of thus correlation.
Burl (1987) considers developments in Wessex, and at Stonehenge in particular, emphasizing the role of the latter throughout its long periods of use as a house of the dead, and linking developments in the ‘cult of the dead’ with changes in the pattern of interest in celestial phenomena. In the early phases, argues Burl, the Neolithic long barrows of Salisbury Plain were oriented between NE and SE on the arc of the horizon where the moon rises (this arc is wider than the corresponding arc for the sun). Later, there was a shift in
emphasis towards orientation upon the horizon arc in the south between the moon’s extreme rising and setting positions. The original henge entrance at
Stonehenge is oriented towards northern limiting moonrise at major standstill (or, equivalently, the northernmost rising of the full moon nearest midwinter). Later again, there was a further shift of emphasis, with the axis of Stonehenge being altered to an imprecise alignment upon the midsummerrising sun. Beaker burials in the Salisbury Plain were also, according to Burl, oriented towards the rising sun. With the Sarsen phase came a final shift from an emphasis upon rising phenomena to one upon setting phenomena. The trilithons offered a range of alignments upon sunsets on dates of calendrical significance.
2 .6 Discussion and interpretations
It is well known that orientatation was an important factor in some of the earliest funerary monuments in the British Isles. A great many of the earthen long barrows of Cranboume Chase are, for example, aligned NW-SE with the larger end at the SE. The orientation of these monuments was largely dictated by the local lie of the land (Ashbee 1970). Entrance graves in the Scilly Isles are
generally set on slopes and frequently, though not always, face downhill, which may have been (at least in part) in order to make the monuments conspicuous (Ashbee 1974). Henshall has commented that a north-easterly
orientation is favoured for the forecourt of the long axis of the Scottish Clyde
cairns (Henshall 1972: 99); that only 12 of the 114 cairns in her OrkneyCromarty group face the western half of the compass, the normal orientation being between NE and SE (Henshall 1963: 104); and that an easterly direction also seems to have been preferred, although not universally, by the builders of



130 When Worlds Collide
Maes Howe type cairns (Henshall 1963: 130). Burl (1981a) gives further examples.
It is less clear when astronomical considerations began to influence these
orientations. Certainly some of the passage graves and round chambered cairns of the mid-third millennium be, in areas of increasing social complexity such as the Boyne valley and the Orkney Islands, seem to have incorporated solar alignments. Newgrange (O’Kelly 1971; Patrick 1974) has already been mentioned; the entrance of Maes Howe (Moir 1981; Burl 1981b) roughly faced the midwinter sunset, but the interpretation is more complex (Burl 1981a). Fraser (1983) finds evidence that the Orkney chambered cairns were situated in
places which were chosen so as to make certain solar observations possible.
These observations could have been of importance to a farming people in
signalling significant times in the agricultural year. He suggests that such monuments, situated in the physical centre and social heart of the community,
would have been the obvious meeting place to rejoice and celebrate the changing of the seasons. According to Burl (1983), solar alignments such as that at Newgrange expressed a symbolic conjunction between the sun and the dead.
A different picture is emerging in areas of lesser social complexity. Burl (1981a) discusses the Clava cairns of Invemessshire, a group of simple passage
graves and ring cairns dating between approximately 3200 and 2300 be and oriented without exception within a quarter of the compass centred upon SSW.
The declinations deduced by Burl (1981a: Table 7.3 & Fig. 7.5) all fall in the range -30° to -18°, suggesting that there was a practice of orientation upon the southern monthly limiting moon (at arbitrary points in the 18.6-year cycle). A large cluster of orientations at the -30° end of the range suggests that there was a special interest in the major standstill moon, implying that the builders even at this early stage were aware of the 18.6-year lunar cycle.
The eastern Scottish Recumbent Stone Circles, discussed above, appear to be descendants of the Clava cairns dating to the early and middle second millennium be (Burl 1976). The pattern of orientation towards the SSW is preserved, as, it seems, is the prepossession with the southern moon (Ruggles & Burl 1985). It is interesting to note that in this part of the country there is no
evidence, as in Orkney or Wessex, of earlier Neolithic burial places being gradually replaced by very large monuments reflecting significantly increasing social complexity during the third and second millennia be. No RSC or other
structure in eastern Scotland at around this time seems significantly more grandiose than its fellows. Instead, Ruggles & Burl (1985) argue that the RSCs



Ruggles 131
seem to be the elegant but simple ritual centres for small, egalitarian groups of subsistence farmers... Various general features in their placement and design seem to reflect a ritual tradition that was adhered to over a wide area...
The western Scottish short stone rows also belong to a region where there is no
evidence of significantly increasing social complexity during the period in question. Here, as we have seen, there is also evidence of a prepossession with
the southern moon.
The pattern of orientation in the primary and secondary directions seems universal, but the symbolism by which it is expressed seems to vary from site to site. Thus at some sites the primary and secondary directions are indicated by stone rows placed a few hundred metres apart; at others the rows are only a few tens of metres apart. At the Kilmartin stones we find a long alignment in which both the northernmost and southernmost components, instead of being single
stones, have become pairs of slabs oriented across the line. The long alignment indicates the primary direction; the orientation of its components indicates the
secondary direction. At Glengorm the alignment upon major standstill moonrise is enhanced by two prominent horizon features.
The overall impression is that both in the east and west of Scotland, in regions where there is no evidence of significantly increasing social complexity during
the third and second millennia be, there is evidence of a widespread interest in
the moon and a general tradition of incoporating lunar alignments into monumental architecture. This contrasts with file evidence from regions such as
Orkney where the architecture of large-scale ‘public’ sites seem to have incorporated solar symbolism. The same seems to be true of the great stone
rings of Cumbria, dating as early as 2500 be: according to Burl (1988) they possessed two alignments, one to a cardinal point and one to sunrise or sunset at an important time of year.
Moving to southern England, while the more precise details of the chronological sequence at and around Stonehenge are still uncertain, and Burl’s (1987) evidence, outlined above, needs further examination from both an archaeological and a statistical point of view, it is possible to discern a definite shift, with the coming in the bluestone phase of social change and potential competition, from a predominant concern with the moon to a predominant concern with the sun. According to Burl, this is linked to changing
developments in the ‘cult of the dead’.

3 Design and geometry in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain
3 .1 Geometrical design and the material record
The problems of extracting information on geometrical design from the material record bear some similarity to those of extracting information on astronomical influences. First, a monumental layout which appears to fit a particular geometrical shape may not have been conceived by the builders as doing so. Secondly, a monumental layout may fit several shapes equally well. Thirdly, a
proposed construction method may bear no resemblance to that actually used by the builders.
The problem of determining how well the layout of a monument fits a particular
geometrical shape or shapes may be approached through the statistical analysis of a large quantity of data. However, many problems beset any such study.
Most work in this area, following Thom (1967), has considered the geometrical
design of the British megalithic rings. The fundamental pitfall here is the
diversity of types of megalithic ring (Burl 1976). There are regional preferences. Many rings have associated cairns, kerbs, banks and ditches; sometimes they are part of a henge. Incomplete preservation often obscures these elements. Attempts at comprehensive classification (e.g. Lynch 1972; 1979) have only been partially successful. Even the selection of free standing menhirs as the crucial diagnostic of a stone ring does not free one from ambiguity. Some rings, such as Temple Wood in Argyll, contain almost contiguous stones which are clearly not kerbs of cairns; others, such as Grey Hill in Gwent, have very large stones spaced within a kerb; others again, such as Castlehowe Scar in Cumbria, have so few stones that it is uncertain whether the site represents a robbed cairn or barrow. Whatever the classification criteria, the list of exceptions is a long one.
The preservation of stones within the ring is variable due to natural, animal, and
human interference. The Rollright Stones in Oxfordshire provide an excellent example of the kinds of alteration which can occur (Lambrick 1983).



Ruggles 133
Given all these problems, the importance of excavated sites cannot be overestimated in the study of geometry and design. Yet very few have
excavated on a large scale and with modem techniques. Those that have have revealed such a number of alterations, both in prehistoric periods and in modem times, that one must question the wisdom of accepting any site plan of extant stones as indicative of single-period, unadulterated activity. Many, if not most, of the sites were multi-period, with the extant plan a result of several phases of growth and alteration. A number of sites, such as Hampton Down (Wainwright 1966), Brandsbutt (Shepherd 1983), Strichen (Hampsher-Monk & Abramson 1982), and Fowlis Wester West (Young 1943), manifested layouts entirely at odds with the shapes extant before excavation.
Any methodology which attempts to analyse the form and pattern of these
monuments must take into account the complexity introduced by their likely long period of use, their changes in function, and the deficiency of the surviving evidence. Statistical studies based on extant remains can only hope to isolate general trends at reasonably large groups of sites.
3 .2 The evidence on geometrical design
The analysis of the shapes of stone rings is not a new phenomenon. Early
observers in general assumed that sites were intended to be circular, although
large deviations from circularity were often encountered in the field. Early plans (e.g. Logan 1829) often smoothed out imperfections and imposed symmetry.
With the advent of accurate surveying techniques, non-circular sites were recognised and recorded. A fundamental question that arises immediately is whether circularity was intended but missed by the builders, or whether a wider range of shapes were intentionally laid out.
Thom was the first to deal with this problem in depth. In the opening paragraph of his first research paper concerning the geometry of megalithic rings, read to the Royal Statistical Society in 1955, he states (Thom 1955):
In the past twenty years I have visited some 250 megalithic sites in England and Scotland, and made accurate surveys where there appeared to be anything worthy of survey... This mass of material provides data for a geometrical and statistical survey of the sites.



134 When Worlds Collide
Thom concluded (1955; 1967) that several different shapes were intended by the builders, laid out to considerable accuracy using techniques of Euclidian geometry. In addition to circles, he argued that the builders of megalithic rings planned ellipses, two forms of flattened circle, ‘egg shapes’, and several more complex constructions.
A number of criticisms have been raised of these conclusions. Archaeologists were quick to point out the functional diversity of megalithic rings taken as a class (Childe 1955). Others pointed out that Thom had done no more than
demonstrate that his range of ‘standard shapes’ provided reasonable fits to the
measured data; he had not demonstrated that other shapes might not fit equally well. Angell (1976; 1977) went so far as to provide several examples of alternative construction techniques leading to shapes which appear to fit certain sites just as well as Thom’s ones. This leads on to the question of how one tests which of two different shapes provides a better fit to some measured data. In general this is a difficult problem, although some techniques have been suggested for its solution, for example by Patrick & Wallace (1982). Patrick
(1978) applied the technique to groups of stone rings in Ireland, concluding that there was no support for Thom’s constructions at these sites. A thorough
critique of Thom’s geometrical theories has been given by Heggie (1981: 23
31, 60-82).
The criticisms of Thom’s conclusions are most difficult to answer in the case of the most complex shapes, for here the present-day interpreter has the greatest freedom of choice in adjusting the (many) parameters of his model to fit the field data. On the other hand the observation that the shapes of megalithic rings fall predominantly into one of a few simple categories has found some archaeological favour and attracted further discussion, most notably by Burl (e.g. 1976).
The least contentious of Thom’s geometrical interpretations of non-circular sites are the ellipses. A number of excavated stone rings are elliptical in shape, for example Cultoon in Islay (MacKie 1981). Two excavated Recumbent Stone ‘Circles’ are in fact elliptical: at one (Strichen) the recumbent stone lies on the major axis of the ellipse, whereas at the other (Berrybrae) it lies on the minor axis (Ruggles & Burl 1985). On the other hand the Thoms’ claim that the great trilithons at Stonehenge originally lay on an ellipse (Thom, Thom & Thom 1974) seems ruled out by the archaeological evidence (Burl 1987:184).



Ruggles 135
There is some evidence of astronomical orientation being interrelated with the geometrical aspects of design. Burl (1985) has noted that a number of megalithic rings are elliptical with their major axes oriented in a direction of astronomical significance, an example being Cultoon, which is an ellipse with
its long axis aligned upon midwinter sunset (MacKie 1981). The timber rings at Woodhenge are also ellipses with their major axes aligned upon midsummer sunrise/midwinter sunset (Thom 1967; Burl 1987). According to Burl (1988), many of the Cumbrian stone rings, the earliest built before 2500 be, were laid out according to strict rules concerning cardinal points (Burl 1988) and also incorporated calendrical alignments in their designs. From a statistical point of view astronomical orientation and geometrical design are formally independent (Ruggles 1984a: 61), so caution is needed in interpretation.
There is some direct evidence for particular geometrical design and construction
methods in the form of peg-holes at critical points such as the foci of ellipses.
J.C. Orkney (priv. comm.) has reported that such features were found during excavations at Temple Wood.
Recently, some different perspectives have been brought to bear upon studies of geometry and design. Bamatt and his collaborators (Barnatt & Moir 1984; Bamatt & Herring 1986) argue that although the constructors of the megalithic rings possessed the ability to construct perfect circles if so desired, and in some
cases did so, most shapes should be seen as poor attempts at circles resulting from laying them out by eye. Bamatt & Moir (1984) base this conclusion on existing survey data, excluding from consideration sites such as the kerbs of
cairns, ring cairns, enclosed cremation cemeteries, chambered tombs, or wooden structures. Primarily this appears to be an attempt to distinguish funerary from non-funerary purpose; yet the authors do admit some sites which had funerary functions (such as Brats Hill), and are often inconsistent in their exclusion of ring cairns (e.g. Tordarroch). Bamatt & Herring (1986) describe an experiment using volunteers to lay out over 100 simulated megalithic circles by eye.
Cowan (1988) suggests that in many cases rings were constructed by two people moving at opposite ends of a piece of rope. This would result in equal
width figures. This idea is intriguing since it does not rule out the possibility that the intention might have been to produce a circle; we usually take it as selfevident that a radius-and-circumference method would be best for the purpose, but this might not be self-evident to the builders.



136 When Worlds Collide
Rather fewer independent attempts have been made comprehensively to reassess
Thom’s geometrical claims than has been the case with the astronomical ones. To a certain extent, this is due to the unavailability of site plans. Thom’s own plans are available in the National Monuments Record of Scotland (Ferguson 1988), but though they form one of the most comprehensive sources of plans of megalithic rings, they generally only record standing (or fallen) stones, often failing to mark important associated features. They also generally lack contouring which would give some idea of the local topography. For documented changes at sites, one must search the voluminous literature on individual sites, although Burl’s remarks in Thom, Thom & Burl (1980) are most helpful.
Ruggles & Kruse (in preparation) have recently attempted a comprehensive re analysis of the available data from England, Scotland, and Wales. Sites were classified into five catagories, from those which have been excavated in their
entirety (22 sites) down to those which are ill-preserved or known from documentary evidence to have been extensively altered. Only the top two or three categories, comprising fewer than 90 sites in all, are considered susceptible to geometrical analysis. The results of this work have yet to be published.
3 .3 Mensuration
The third and final strand of ‘megalithic science’ relates to mensuration. Thom
hypothesised that many of the British megalithic rings and other free-standing megalithic sites, such as the long multiple rows in Brittany, were laid out using a precise unit of measurement, the ‘megalithic yard’ (MY) of 0.829m (e.g. Thom 1967). Later publications postulated the existence of a ‘megalithic rod’ equal to 2.5 MY, and a ‘megalithic inch’ (MI) of 1/40 MY (e.g. Thom & Thom 1978a). Thom (1967: 34) suggested a relationship between the MY and the Iberian vara, with MacKie (1977:192) taking the theme much further.
This article will not attempt to discuss megalithic mensuration in any detail: for a
full account the reader is referred once again to Heggie (1981). It is fair to note, however, that statistical reassessments of Thom’s data both from classical (Kendall 1974) and Bayesian (Freeman 1976) viewpoints reached the conclusion that the evidence in favour of the MY was at best marginal, and that even if it does exist the uncertainty in our knowledge of its value is of the order



Ruggles 137
of centimetres, far greater than the 1mm precision claimed by Thom. In other words, the evidence presented by Thom could be adequately explained by, say, monuments being set out by pacing, with the ‘unit’reflecting an average length of pace. It is also fair to point out that not all authors are in agreement with this conclusion (e.g. Davis 1983).
It should be pointed out here that the statisticians only accepted evidence from circular stone rings, thus severely reducing Thom’s own (1967) data set. The reason was that Thom linked his arguments about geometrical shapes to the proposed unit of measure. Thus geometrical constructions were fitted to sites by assuming an MY value, while data for the analysis seeking to establish the reality of the MY included the lengths of constructors in these same geometrical
models. From a statistical point of view mensuration and geometrical design are
formally independent hypotheses, requiring separate testing.
3 .4 Discussion and interpretations
The design layout of a site cannot be separated from consideration of its functions. Whatever these were, and they are demonstrably not the same for the entire corpus, stone rings were civic monuments. Rarely are these sites associated with settlements, or is dating evidence available. Generally built
during the late Neolithic and early Bronze Ages, their durability ensured a long usage, and often one involving modification in plan and function. A large
number of sites, though not all, were designed, or adapted, with a funerary function in mind. The apparent transition from the Clava Cairn tradition to the later Recumbent Stone Circles (Burl 1976), some with internal ring cairns and some without, highlights the difficulties in classification. Sometimes only a token amount of an entire cremation is present at a site (e.g. Lynch 1984: 2829). Where a burial or cairn was erected at the same time as a stone ring, the emphasis may well have been focussed not upon the ring, but upon the part of the site which would contain the funerary remains. As a result, the shape of the ring would have depended on that of a central monument. Thus phasing information is directly relevant to the consideration of site design.
It is hardly surprising, then, that the statistical evidence for geometrical influences on monumental design is much weaker than that pertaining to astronomical ones. All authors accept that some megalithic rings are more perfectly circular than others. Most would accept that certain other sites were



138 When Worlds Collide
planned as ellipses, although Bamatt & Moir (1984) see all other sites as poor attempts at circles. Beyond circles and ellipses, some tentatively accept that many other sites may be classifiable into a small number of further simple shapes, but others would disagree. The results of the comprehensive analysis by Ruggles & Kruse may bear upon the argument.
The evidence for any exact unit of measurement is extremely weak and rests essentially upon secondary geometrical hypotheses.
Burl (1976: 41) notes that the large open rings of western Britain tend to be circular whereas many of the smaller Scottish and Irish rings with burials are
elliptical. However he continues: ‘There is.... an overlapping of shapes amongst all the smaller sites and it is very doubtful whether any valid geometrical distinction may be made between them’. And indeed, later analyses of the shapes of the large open rings (Burl 1988) seem to indicate a virtually even balance of circular and non-circular shapes.
Bamatt & Moir (1984) claim that in southern England, and perhaps in north eastern Scotland, there are groups of stone rings which have distinctive architectural traits and appear to have been planned to be circular, i.e. laid out
using by peg and rope rather than by eye. These more carefully constructed stone rings, they suggest, may be associated with other phenomena, such as
craft specialization, that demonstrate the emergence of a society that could support individuals who concentrated on particular skills.
4 The wider scene
There have been investigations of orientation and astronomy in other parts of Europe right through from the Upper Palaeolithic (Marshack (1972a; 1972b; 1979) provides evidence for astronomical observation and notation in the Ice
Age) to the Iron Age. However, they tend to have involved a number of isolated examples and do not yet provide any sort of coherent picture. Thus, for example, Barlai (1980) finds evidence in a selection of prehistoric cemeteries in eastern Europe of grave orientations on sunrise and sunset on each burial day. Ouzounian (1984) describes evidence of a variety of astronomical observations in Bronze Age Armenia. There is possible evidence of lunar orientation amongst the oldest Nuraghic tombs in Sardinia, built in the late second millennium be (Proverbio et al. 1987), and of stellar orientations in the taulas, a group of



Ruggles 139
monuments associated with villages of the talayotic culture (first millennium be) on the island of Menorca (Hoskin 1985; 1989; Hoskin & Waldren 1988). It would be foolish to attempt to derive any broader hypotheses from such diverse data.
Apart from Thom’s investigations in Brittany (see, e.g., Thom & Thom 1978a)
there have been few discussions of geometrical aspects of design in prehistoric monuments outside the British Isles. Some aspects of recent work concerning more modem stone circles in the Basque Country are, however, worthy of special comment.
In the Basque country there appears to be evidence of a system of the social organisation of space dating back to at least the early Middle Ages and surviving into the present century. It is reflected in the material record through the physical demarcation of communal space by stone circles and menhirs, as well as in constructs and concepts in the Basque language. Some aspects of the
system have been reconstructed by Frank (1980; 1989) through historical texts, ethnolinguistic reconstructions based on terms found in the Basque language
and linked to concrete objects used in the pastoral society, particularly those
objects used to record and measure, and extensive interviews with Basque speakers.
Communal lands in the Basque Country were laid out in circular configurations
marked by stone circles, menhirs and more modem boundary stones. These configurations bore an intimate relationship to the socio-economic and political structures of Basque pastoral society. The stone circle defined the communal space of the basic unit of Basque pastoral society, the polis, where a shepherd
and his family along with other families lived, cared for their livestock, and conducted their social, religious and economic activities. Space was provided in the circle forjudicial proceedings, ritual gaming and dance. Meetings took place here on matters of common concern. Circles are related to transhumance practices, and are found both in areas of summer and winter grazing. They are only found where the pasture is appropriate for grazing, near a water source and sheltered from the winds (Barandiaran 1953; 1973).
The geometrical organisation of this communal space provided the members of the polis with significant information, including knowledge of an astronomical and calendrical nature. The circular configuration relates to the structuring of power within the polis. The position of ‘head’ of the circle was constantly rotated around the stones. Similarly, the position of burn, or ‘head’ of the polis



140 When Worlds Collide
was rotated around its members. The Basque term buruzagi (literally the keeper or guardian of the head) refers to the one whose position places him or her at the head, a concept distinct (unlike in Indo-European languages) from that of the head itself. Power resides in the group, not in die individual; it is positional, but not intrinsic to a fixed position. Power and knowledge are shared amongst, and rotated around, the group.
Historical documents indicate that the stone circles and a geometrical system for their construction was fully developed by the early Middle Ages. Many circles continued to function in this way into the present century, and legal documents abound relating boundary disputes. These documents also give an insight into construction methods. The most commonly described method is first to place a centre stone, then to place four further stones at a specified distance in each of the cardinal directions, then four further stones on the perimeter mid-way between the cardinal stones, the finally to add smaller ‘witness’ stones on the
perimeter. The centre stone and eight boundary stones would typically measure two metres or more in height.
According to Frank, the Basque measuring system was a complex entity
growing out of an interlocking set of social, ideologically motivated perceptions and organisational principles. Thus, for example, circles were set out using
ropes knotted off in units of seven (smaller knots) and 49 (larger knots) ‘feet’, a foot being one third of a vara, a traditional short yard of 0.836m which is still used in many parts of the Basque Country. The same units of measurement crop up elsewhere, as in the length of the staff or bar used in ritualised jousting (seven feet). Perimeter circles comprise eight or multiples of eight stones. The Basque calendar was conceived of as being divided into chains of eight units each of eight days. On a practical level, tasks such as the making of cheese were passed round the polis according to the calendar. There is also a sequence of three days which may be linked to the phases of the moon (Bausani 1982).
The eight larger perimeter stones reflected the total number of sheep allowed in each polis, each representing a unit of 56 milking ewes, or eight subunits of seven ewes each. There was a need for precision here: the planet Venus was associated with a belief in a goddess who lives off people alleging that they have too many or too few sheep, taking in either case the number of animals over- or understated and leaving the shepherd with fewer than before.
Frank claim s that elem ents o f the geom etrical design o f the Basque stone circles
bear a resemblance to what is found in the prehistoric material record, both



Ruggles 141
locally and further north in north-western Europe. Here the evidence is more circumstantial, but it is supported by consideration of pre-Indo-European cultural artefacts embedded semantically in the Basque language. The argument for continuity is also strengthened by die very survival of a language derived from the pre-Indo-European linguistic substratum.
Whatever the merits or otherwise of these arguments, the Basque stone circles
example clearly illustrates the potential of a broader perspective on matters of
the incorporation of geometrical features in monumental design. There have, for
example, been few attempts to discern how the constructors of megalithic rings
might have conceptualised a particular design. Instead, the conventional approach is built upon the fundamental concept of geometrical shape, whether circle, ellipse, egg, or whatever. We might ask why prehistoric communities should have been interested in demarcating geometrical shapes, circles or otherwise.
The following passage from Frank (1989) is instructive:
I had great difficulties getting the Basque speakers to admit that the
entities I am discussing were stone circles at all. Since they see them as pasture lands marked off with stones at a certain distance from the centre, evidently they did not fill in the rest of the circumference space to create a circle, rather leaving it as a ‘centre’ stone and eight ‘outer’ stones without taking the conceptual leap forward which would have allowed them to see that this done in fact create a ‘stone circle’.
The assumption that the constructors of megalithic rings conceptualised shape in the same way as we do moulds our interpretation, for example towards an absolute demarcation between the interior and exterior. It is notable that the assumption is still not openly questioned that some shape, even if it be merely a circle (very poorly achieved in some cases), was actually intended. Examples such as the Basque one may help us to devise new approaches through broader understanding.



142 When Worlds Collide
5 Some conclusions and speculations
Investigations in ‘megalithic science’ tended until recently to concentrate on large spectacular sites. In fact, groups of simple, architecturally similar sites provide the most promising means of extracting reliable evidence on factors influencing design and orientation where these merge into a discernible common tradition. In studies of such sites—sites yielding little in the way of stratigraphical and artefactual evidence—the approach of the surveyor or engineer, concentrating more on features such as shape, design and orientation, can be of considerable interest in shedding some light on changing patterns of social tradition. Recently we have begun to see the archaeologist and
astronomer or engineer working together in order to consider the relationship of sites to the surrounding landscape and skyscape.
Within those areas of investigation deriving from ‘megalithic science’, the astronomical line of enquiry is at present by far the most promising; there is important evidence of astronomical influences on monumental orientations which may bear upon changing ritual practice in different parts of Britain during the third and second millennia be. Some new and potentially fruitful lines of
enquiry have recently emerged with regard to the geometrical construction of
megalithic rings, but the conclusions must be regarded as tentative. Mensuration
seems to be a relatively unrewarding topic: there is simply too little evidence in
the material record for any convincing conclusions to be drawn.
The general picture which seems to emerge from archaeoastronomical studies is one of low-precision astronomical alignments being incorporated in various ways in monumental architecture in Britain through the third and second millennia be. There is evidence of a change from a lunar to a solar emphasis, accompanying social change, in areas as widespread as Orkney in the north and
Wessex in the south. However in areas such as western and eastern Scotland, where social change was much slower, the lunar tradition seems to have
persisted.
The lunar alignments do involve the observation of the extreme positions of the moon in its 18.6-year cycle and thus would have required organised lunar observations over a period of at least twenty years. However the precision of the alignments is sufficiently low that the observations involved are not arduous: occasional observations of the full moon nearest the summer solstice would have sufficed.



Ruggles 143
This picture is rather different from MacKie’s (1977): he argues that a ‘two-tier’ social system was in operation in some megalith-building societies, the top tier being a dlite of astronomer-priests undertaking intricate astronomical observations. He also argues strongly that a precise solar calendar was in use (e.g. MacKie 1988). However, these arguments rest heavily upon Thom’s evidence for high-precision alignments, evidence which has been much questioned (see above), and upon his interpretation of the evidence from a new site at Brainport Bay, Argyll (MacKie et al. 1985), which has also been questioned (Ruggles 1985b).
It is of some interest to ask how often an interest in the rising or setting major standstill moon is encountered in the cultural record world-wide. While
knowledge of the lunar month is almost universal, and many seasonal calendars
are lunar-based, ethnographic instances of horizon lunar observations are unknown, at least to the present author. This must lead us to seek an
explanation for their apparent importance in prehistoric Scotland. One such explanation might be the latitude, at which the major standstill moon is seen to scrape along just above the southern horizon—a rare and spectacular event which could perhaps have assumed great importance. Clearly it would be of
great interest if any evidence were forthcoming of a similar interest in the rising and setting moon amongst communities in similar latitudes, such as in eastern
Europe.
One of the most challenging aspects of investigations in the areas deriving from ‘megalthic science’ is that they represent areas of enquiry where the physical scientist and the archaeologist or anthropologist have conflicting, but both undeniably relevant, points of view on the nature of admissible evidence, and on the conclusions that can reasonably be drawn from that evidence. Many authors, and particularly those trained in the humanities, would conclude (and have concluded) that any rigorous statistical approach, since it can ultimately only isolate overall trends and necessarily excludes most of the cultural and functional diversity represented in the material record, is of very limited value indeed. Others, however, and particularly those trained in the numerate sciences, would say the same of any investigation which fails, through the lack of such an approach, to attempt to distinguish between deliberate design features and chance occurrences. Ironically, both camps end up by arguing that not to accept their viewpoint would be to open the floodgates to unabated speculation.



144 When Worlds Collide
These problems are of wider relevance than just to the areas of enquiry in question—or indeed to archaeology as a whole. The fundamental problem is that evidence acceptable to a numerate scientist is of a very different nature from that acceptable to his counterpart trained in the humanities. It is the view of this author that much of the controversy stirred up by investigations in ‘megalithic science’ stems not from sheer prejudice, as is often claimed on both sides, or even from the lack of detailed background knowledge or ability in mathematics, astronomy or archaeology; but merely from this simple fact. In investigating astronomical and geometrical influences on monumental design two very different approaches to the interpretation of the material record meet head-on, and in order for progress to be made they must be reconciled so that the available evidence can be considered in its entirety in a satisfactory way.
The present author (Ruggles 1988b) has suggested ways of bringing about this reconciliation. It is to be hoped that integrated methodological approaches resulting from such suggestions, together with the further accumulation of field evidence, will add substance to the tentative conclusions given here.

THE MAFIA HYPOTHESIS
Antonio Gilman
California State University-Northridge
Any analysis o f the entry o f Indo-European languages into Europe must take
in to accou n t the subcontinent’s social landscape during the period o f their
diffusion. If, as most Indo-Europeanists seem to believe, the entry took place in
the third millennium B.C., then the spread o f Indo-European coincides with a
major transformation in the social organization of prehistoric European societies.
As the authors of the best modern synthesis of the European Bronze Age conclude:
During the course o f the Bronze A ge a number of important changes took
p lace-ch an ges that lend the period its characteristic appearance and
distinguish it from anything that had gone before ... Perhaps the most
obvious o f these is the rise o f the privileged ... It is hard to think of this
process in terms other than those o f the aggrandizement of the few, the
rise of the elite, and the start of social stratification (Coles & Harding
1979: 535).
In the context o f this conference it may be appropriate, therefore, to consider the
causal dynamics o f the emergence of elites in the later prehistory of Europe.
Anthropological studies over the course of the past century have presented
two broad contrasting accounts o f the origins of social stratification. The first
position, nowadays accepted by the great majority of prehistorians, underlines the
functional integration needed for the developm ent of econom ic and social
com plexity. In their recent E volution o f Human Societies, A llen Johnson and
Timothy Earle emphasize the services chiefs render to commoners:
As population increases, there comes a time when the local group or
intergroup co llectiv ity can no longer be relied on to handle these
life-an d -d eath matters [risk management, technology, warfare, and trade]
(Johnson & Earle 1987: 209).
This is a straightforward echo of Marshall Sahlins’ (1972: 140) proposition that:
The ch ief creates a collective good beyond the conception and capacity of
the so ciety ’s dom estic groups taken separately. He institutes a public



152 When Worlds Collide
economy greater than the sum of its household parts.
Depending upon the specific setting in which incipient stratification is observed,
the public services which the elites would have organized for commoners may be
the construction and management of irrigation systems or other public works (e.g.,
W ittfogel 1957), the organization of systems of exchange (e.g., Rathje 1971), the
military leadership required to obtain the Lebensraum for a larger population (e.g.,
Webster 1977), the provision of insurance in the event of subsistence failure (e.g.,
Halstead & O’Shea 1982), or (more generally) the regulation of the information
required to manage large-scale, internally differentiated society (e.g., Flannery
1972).
In a recent review article on chiefdoms Earle (1987: 293-294) points out the
central deficiency of the mainstream, managerial account of elite origins:
Intensification and related changes in the subsistence economy do create
problems requiring management, but low -level management would seem in
most instances best for the local population. Such management can be
expected to be responsive to the needs of the population in contrast to a
distant, regional chiefly hierarchy that would be more inaccessible and
unaccountable for their actions.
Provision of such low -level administrative services would, of course, be entirely
com patible with achieved managerial statuses (of "big men"). The very hallmark of
complex societies is that superordinate statuses are ascribed, however.
The second major approach to the origins of social complexity responds to
these d ifficu lties. Instead o f asking, "What good are elites?” this approach asks,
"How do elites maintain their power?" Precisely because both chiefs and big-men
at times provide useful managerial services to their subjects and/or followers,
what distinguishes chiefs from big-men has nothing to do with management. Tribal
leaders had achieved their positions from time immemorial by providing the
b en efits o f leadership to their follow ers. Thus, when leaders contrived to
consolidate their positions on a hereditary basis, that consolidation must have been
due to som ething other than their services. It must be due, rather, to novel
opportunities for control absent in simpler economies. In short, circumstances must
have arisen that would permit leaders to exploit their followers on a relatively
stable, long-term basis. A focus on exploitation involves, of course, a shift from a



Gilman 153
functionalist orientation to one which stresses the internal conflicts of class
societies.
Given such a perspective, one should begin investigation of the development
of hereditary inequalities by looking for contrastive relationships of exploitation.1
A con flict-orien ted approach to European prehistory must, then, take up two
issues: first, what is the nature of class divisions (if these can be demonstrated to
exist at all)? second, what is the dominant form through which exploitation takes
place? Any attack on these questions faces daunting problems of .evidence,
problem s due in part to the research orien tation s w hich have generated the
available archaeological record. European archaeologists have too often regarded
econom ic matters as mundane common denominators of little significance to the
prehistory that really mattered, and evidence for them has only been developed on
an uneven basis. Likewise, the archaeological measures of stratification and class
conflict suggested by Jonathan Haas (1982: 91-123) are difficult to apply to a
record recovered by scholars who have adopted a systematic methodological
pessimism in order to avoid dealing with such matters. That the social divisions
which would have existed in societies on the threshold o f complexity would be
relatively small in scale only compounds the difficulties.
As a result, it is only by resorting to a kind o f trickery that we can advance
at all. The ruse, in essence, is to use the idealist predilections of most prehistorians
against them selves in order to construct a prehistorical materialism. The
archaeological record is largely the unintentional residue of human activities: it
consists mostly o f garbage. Its students have generally sought to recover from it
the same kind o f information that is available to students o f history, and they
have brought to that task the normativist theoretical perspectives of most
1. I am mindful here of the famous passage from volume 3 of C a p ita l:
"The sp ecific econom ic form in which unpaid surplus-labour is pumped out of
direct producers determines the relationship o f rulers and ruled ... Upon this ... is
founded the entire form ation of the econom ic com m unity .... thereby
sim ultaneously its sp ecific political form. It is always the relationship of the
owners ... to the direct producers ... which reveals the innermost secret, the hidden
basis of the entire social structure" (Marx 1967 [orig. 1894]: 791).



historians. Prehistorians have, therefore, primarily sought to recover and study
those aspects o f the m aterial record most laden with overt human intentions:
stylistically distinctive artifacts (especially those of intrinsic value and aesthetic
merit), major architectural remains, and burials. These, of course, are the aspects
of the material record that are liable to concentrate the greatest amount of value
(that require large investments of human labor to gain the intrinsic qualities sought
by the prehistorians).
N ow , in general, classes should be defined on the basis o f an objective
relation o f exploitation and not on class consciousness. In a class society, however,
it is essential that at least one class be a class for itself: to the extent that rulers
are deceived about themselves and do not act in their common self-interest, they
will be unable to maintain their exploitation in the face of their subordinates’
inevitable reluctance to surrender surplus value. The propertied class must devote
part of the surplus they control to making their position overt and conspicuous to
each other. The material residue of their efforts is precisely what has attracted the
interest o f normativist prehistorians. Archaeologists are, therefore, in a reasonably
good position to reconstruct the early development of ruling-class consciousness.
In the area where I have done most o f my work, southeast Spain, the
development of fortifications and burial patterns over the course of the Neolithic,
Copper and Bronze Ages clearly reflects a progressive strengthening of elite class
consciousness.2 The late N eolithic "Almeria Culture" of the early fourth millennium
B.C. is characterized by a collective burial rite in caves, rock-cut tombs, and
simple megalithic chambered tombs in which grave goods consist of utilitarian
goods, sim ple ornaments, and ritual fetishes. In the Copper A ge "Los M illares
Culture" (3500-2250 B.C.) the collective burial rite continues but the chambered
tombs are sometimes larger and more complex in their construction and the grave
goods are sometimes rendered in exotic or expensive raw materials (ivory imported
from North A frica, copper). The Beaker pottery and accompanying trinkets and
weapons of the late Copper Age are part of a fancy sumptuary assemblage
154 When Worlds Collide

the later prehistoric sequence in southeast Spain.



Gilman 155
popular throughout the Peninsula. The wealth of the grave goods becomes
significantly differentiated both within and between tomb groups. In the early
Bronze A ge "El Argar Culture" o f the late third and early second millennium the
burial pattern changes radically. The dead are buried individually under the floors
o f their houses with grave goods consisting o f their personal finery: the weapons,
jew elry, and fin e pottery interred in the richer burials form part of a more
standardized sumptuary assem blage than in the preceding period, and wealth
differentials between tombs become larger. The increasing social differentiation in
burial rites is accompanied by evidence for increasing social conflict between
communities. O pen-air settlements o f the N eolithic are poorly known but seem to
have consisted o f short-term unfortified hamlets built o f relatively flim sy raw
m aterials. In the Copper Age settlements are often long-term occupations (the
stratigraphies may span several centuries) of stone houses, and they are sometimes
protected by walls with bastions. These defensive preoccupations become even
stronger in the Bronze Age, when settlements typically are acropoles located on
high h illto p s relatively distant from good arable land and water. In southeast
Spain, then, the developm ent o f m etallurgy, an expensive technology for the
production o f luxury goods; the wide distribution of particular styles of finery; the
increase in military activity, both as a practice and as a value; the shift from
collective to individualized burial rituals; all point to the development of an upper
class whose rule depended, at least in part, on strong-arm tactics and whose
recruitment was stable enough to establish wide-ranging, mutually supportive
partnerships.
As Stephen Shennan (1982: 11) notes, "on the whole the Iberian situation fits
in very w ell with the general European trends ... o f intensification, growth of
ranking and increased emphasis on prestige goods" during the third millennium.
The details vary in the sequences of each area of the continent, but whether or not
one cares to describe this process as involving a transition from a Lineage to a
Germanic M ode o f Production (Thomas 1987), it seems clear that "starting in south
east Europe in the later fourth millennium and extending to the most western
fringes by the mid-second millennium, a series of profound and structurally similar
changes occurred" (Rowlands 1984: 150), all involving a shift towards greater,



156 When Worlds ColUde
more permanent social inequalities.3
It is clear, of course, that the privileged class of third-millennium southeast
Spain must have been constrained in its self-aggrandizem ent by the absence of
state institutions permitting indirect, collective exploitation o f followers and by the
presence of continuing kinship obligations to followers. The class societies of
prehistoric Europe would have been based on direct patron-client relations, within
which the amount o f surplus leaders can take from their followers is limited by
the rationale upon which surplus capture is based. What, then, can we say of the
sources of upward income flow within these incipiently stratified societies?
Here we are limited, of course, by the nature of the purely archaeological
evidence available to us. If we suppose that control over systems of exchange gave
leaders the opportunity to extract a surplus from their dealings, we cannot point to
records of the transactions to support our views. If we argue that the surplus
consisted of rent obtained from a peasantry, we must do so without direct
evidence for the arrangements governing land tenure (although field systems,
where these survive, may provide interesting insights). We can hope that the
scenarios for exploitation which we devise are consistent with available evidence,
but inevitably the validity of any line of argument must be based more on the
realism than on the empiricism of the claims advanced. Insofar as Europeanist
prehistorians have dealt with the problem of the nature of exploitation at all, they
have (im plicitly for the most part) based their thinking on Engels* treatment of
commodity exchange in The Origins of the Family. I would like to argue here that
this view is less realistic than one which sees the capture of surplus by the
privileged as the collection of rent from agricultural producers.
The development of class divisions in later prehistoric Europe is associated
with the development o f copper and bronze metallurgy, and it is control over the
supply o f metal that is principally implicated in the commodity-exchange account
of Bronze Age exploitation. As this was originally developed by Gordon Childe,
3. An important contrast between the Iberian Peninsula and northern and
central Europe during the third millennium is the much greater importance of
settlem ent nucleation in the former. The significance of this contrast is discussed
below.



Gilman 157
the demand of Near Eastern civilizations for metal would have stimulated the
gen esis o f com pradore e lite s in the N ear E ast’s European Third World. The
development o f evidence that metallurgy and attendant class divisions were well
under way in Europe before the reach of Near Eastern economies could possibly
have extended there makes a core-periphery interpretation of European prehistoric
developm ent untenable prior to the Iron Age, however. More recent thinking has
concentrated, therefore, on the significance of the local development of metallurgy
in stimulating a network o f exchange whose control could generate income for the
chiefs. For the El Argar culture of southeast Spain, for example, Vicente Lull
argues as follows:
T he d ev elo p m en t o f m eta llu rg y ... p roduced a sharp ch an ge in ...
production which in turn ... made necessary other changes in social
relations. The original self-supporting communities became communities
w ith com plem entary production requiring trade. This also caused an
improvement in communication and routes o f transport; an improvement
that fostered a managerial hierarchy, most likely for security reasons. The
hierarchy formed in this manner from direct production became concerned
in the tasks o f organization and protection of [their] interests. The division
o f labor ... produced an emerging trade of products with quite different
exchange values. The political classes found in the self-supporting tribal
communities were replaced by a new stratification (Lull 1984: 1222-1223).
P osition s such as Lull’s are more common in various functionalist versions, in
which leaders are seen as providing higher-order regulation of exchange systems
as a service to their followers, but whether or not the relations are envisaged as
exploitative, they face two empirical problems. First, the production of metal was
extrem ely lim ited during the early Bronze Age: in southeast Spain the type-site of
the El Argar culture, the richest and largest site from that time and region yet
excavated, with over 1200 burials spanning several hundred years, yielded just
over 34 kg o f copper, an amount obtainable from about one ton of ore (Chapman
1984: 1150). Second, the m etal produced was alm ost exclu sively devoted to
weapons and finery; in Spain there are no Bronze Age agricultural tools. Eleanor
Leacock (1972: 33) has commented that:
D espite Marx’s important discussion of commodity production in the first



158 When Worlds Collide
section of Capital, thefe has been little follow-through by marxist scholars
on how the acquisition and exchange of a surplus by early states entrapped
urban populations as a lower class ...
For the v illa g e-sized communities o f Copper and Bronze Age southeast Spain it is
hard to see how such a follow -through is possible. The metal-working industry
could have been operated at the village level by occasional exploitation of nearby
ore bodies. Failure to obtain access to metal would have had little effect on basic
agricultural production. Thus, in the terms usefully elaborated by Haas (1982:
167-169), both the com pliance costs and the refusal costs of participating in the
network o f metallurgical production and exchange would have been slight.4 For
this reason I have argued (Gilman 1976, Gilman & Thornes 1985) that the
emergent ruling class o f the Copper and Bronze Age in southeast Spain derived
the bulk o f their income by the same means that their successors did until well
into the modern period, i.e., by extracting rent from a peasantry (through "staple
fin a n c e ” in th e sen se d evelop ed by T erence D ’A ltroy & Earle [1985]). The
emergence of class stratification in the third millennium B.C. is associated with the
introduction of intensified agriculture as the basis of subsistence production:
irrigation, exploitation of animals for their secondary products (traction [horses for
transport, oxen for the plow], fiber, milk products), and perhaps cultivation of tree
crops such as olives and vines. All of these intensifications could be introduced by
the primary producers without managerial assistance, but all have the common
feature that they increase agricultural yields at the price of raising the fixed costs
of production. The accumulation of agricultural investments expected to yield
incom e over a long term would make primary producers vulnerable to the
extraction o f rent in that it would be wiser to deliver a portion of a surplus to an
overlord than to relinquish the income from their investments altogether. The
4. It seem s unreasonable to suggest, as Childe (1954: 158) did and as
Johnson and Earle (1987: 210) do, that possession of metal weapons would provide
rulers with control o f the "means o f destruction" in the sense developed by Goody
(1971). A mob o f peasants armed with slingshots could overcome the best equipped
Bronze A ge hero, provided that they were organized to resist. Effective violence is
a social, not a technological fact.



Gilman 159
sumptuary arrangements o f Bronze Age elite burials bear ample witness that, in
the absence o f state political entities, members of the ruling classes themselves
provided the enforcem ent required to maintain the social asymmetries arising from
the extraction o f rent. In southeast Spain (and elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula:
Harrison & Moreno Lopez 1985), the development of social stratification attends
the developm ent of the M editerranean p olyculture on which all later
M editerranean civilizations rested. On this reading of the evidence, the social
formation of Bronze Age southeast Spain would have fallen at the most petty
‘feudal’ end of the range of "tributary modes of production" (W olf 1981: 51).
The im portance o f agricultural intensification in the M illaran/A rgaric
trajectory can be seen by comparing developments in southeast Spain to those of
adjacent regions to the north and west. The southeast is the most arid region, not
just o f the Iberian Peninsula, but o f all Europe, so that irrigation, terracing, tree
crops, and so on, would have been particularly useful in stabilizing and increasing
production. Better-watered regions adjacent to the southeast (such as the uplands
o f Andalusia and the Spanish Levant), where capital intensification o f agriculture
would have been less critical, have archaeological sequences contemporaneous and
similar to the Millaran and Argaric, but with markedly smaller concentrations of
wealth.
To underline the role of an expanding system of staple finance in the
emergence o f social complexity in prehistoric southeast Spain is not to suggest that
rent extraction was the only source of income for Millaran/Argaric rulers. There
is ample evidence for the creation, concentration, and circulation of luxuries (for
"wealth finance" in D’Altroy & Earle’s terms): ivory, fine pottery (such as Beakers),
and o f course metal (not just copper and bronze, but gold and silver), among other
finery, were increasingly represented in high status burials over the course of the
Copper and Bronze Ages. The progressive development of metal working reflects
the expanding importance of a material whose durability and fungibility make it
an ideal primitive valuable. Two points are clear, however. First, any system of
wealth finance presupposes some system of staple finance. To suggest that wealth
exchange can lead to the development of complexity without specifying how the
surplus concentrated into wealth is obtained in the first instance, that complex
societies "emerged together, pulling each other up by the bootstraps" (Renfrew



160 When Worlds Collide
1986a: 11), would be to say that elites "arose by taking in each other’s washing"
(Carneiro 1977: 222). Second, the scope of wealth finance operations seems quite
lim ited in the M illaran/Argaric world. Very little in the way of materials of
sp ecifically southeast Spanish origin is found outside that region (Gilman 1987);
only a trickle o f exotic valuables made their way into that region (cf. Harrison
and Gilman 1977); and within the region valuables seem to have circulated over
quite short distances.5 It seems clear that the main force underlying the increase in
social com plexity over the course of the third and early second millennium B.C. in
southeast Spain was the progressive intensification of agricultural production and
the increased possibilities of rent collection this intensification afforded.
A model along these lines has the merit that it specifies a realistic link
between class stratification and the intensified systems of subsistence production
which universally accompany such stratification (Gilman 1981). In southeast Spain
it is the value as capital o f fixed assets such as irrigation systems, terraced fields,
and so on, that binds primary producers to their masters. It is clear, therefore, that
an approach to the origins of stratification that emphasized the viability of
non-economic coercion must be modified when it addresses areas where capital
assets are not spatially fixed. This is the case for northern and central Europe,
w here so cia l stratification arises in the context of the secondary products
revolution (Sherratt 1981). Thus, Shennan (1986: 132) argues that the widespread
use of the plow
removed the pressure on local resources [of the previous horticultural
subsistence system] and resulted in a diminution of warfare. Once this had
occurred, the main pressure for defended nucleation was removed, and
community fission in response to internal conflict and population increase
would have become a possibility; it may also be that in the absence of
other constraints, there is a tendency toward dispersed patterns of
agricultural settlem ent for least-effort reasons. This expansion is one of
5. Thus, Lull (1983: 439) notes that tin (as opposed to arsenical) bronzes
are much more frequent in Argaric burials of the Cartagena/Mazarron district
(where a source of tin exists) than in contemporaneous burials in the Vera basin,
50 km to the southwest.



Gilman 161
the main empirical reasons for rejecting Gilman’s account of the growth of
social stratification in temperate Europe in the Bronze Age since it runs
directly counter to the situation he postulates in which people are reluctant
to move from existing cleared land because of the investment they have
put into it and are therefore potentially open to exploitation.
Now, w hile clearing field s for the plow is certainly more costly than clearing
them for horticulture, the main capital assets in secondary products subsistence
systems are the the anim als them selves. An agriculturist is vulnerable to the
expropriation of his animals wherever he may move.6 He does not simply consume
his animals as they grow to maturity, he retains them so as to produce, and for the
privilege of doing so he is vulnerable to extortion. Furthermore, an individual
farmer who keeps oxen for his plow will not ordinarily maintain breeding stock
for their replacement and w ill, therefore, be dependent on the larger-scale
liv esto ck ow ners who supply him.7 In secondary products system s, precisely
because livestock function both as productive assets and as transferable wealth,
they o ffer excellent opportunities for elite control. Rather than see the dispersed
settlem ent pattern characteristic of third-millennium temperate Europe as the
result o f diminished social conflict, one may interpret it as the result of the mode
o f elite control. Peasants would be subject to threats, not to their persons, but to
their animals. The ethnographic record on pastoral societies far more mobile than
6. As Julian Thomas (1987) points out, even in N eolithic subsistence
systems, where livestock were kept largely for their primary products (meat, hides,
etc.), cattle "management" constituted the material base for the social dominance of
lineage elders.
7. James Lewthwaite, whose amusing critcal comments to my 1981 article
led the organizers o f this symposium to suggest "The Mafia hypothesis” as the title
of this paper, has latterly changed his views on the realism of my approach.
Commenting on the significance of the secondary products revolution, he observes:
"A small group controlling the critical means o f production (the herds)
would clearly have been in a powerful position to exploit the remainder ... The
infrequent renewal of the feudal [landlord] class in Sicily has always taken place
from the ranks o f the g a b elo tti, the possessors of cattle; in fact, g a b elo tto is
practically synonymous with mafioso ..." (Lewthwaite 1985: 219).



162 When Worlds Collide
any which can be supposed to have existed in later prehistoric Europe is replete
with exam ples o f the opportunities for control which herds of livestock present to
leaders (e.g., Shahrani 1979, Barth 1964).8
The temperate European focus on cattle-herding is entirely consonant with a
view of the p olitical econom y of early stratified societies which underlines
non-econom ic coercion as the basis of elite power.9 The production and exchange
o f valuables certainly seems to have been far more active in temperate Europe
than in the central and western Mediterranean, but (to use Haas’s terminology) the
cost for primary producers of refusing participation in that trade cannot have been
im portant. It is d iffic u lt to see how the trade in bronze, amber or other
preciosities could establish the basis for economic pressure on peasants who would
never receive such material. The "monopolistic conditions of exchange" which
Shennan (1986: 139) places at the root of "growing social differentiation" would
have affected directly the relations of emergent elites with one another, but only
indirectly the relations o f such elites with the primary producers of the surplus on
which they depended. As Colin Renfrew (1986b) points out, valuables do not
function as econom ic commodities until well after the period under consideration
here. Johnson and Earle (1987: 249) discuss cogently the similarities between
"feudalism" and chiefdom s. One point of similarity is the primacy of non-economic
coercion in the process of elite surplus capture. In Europe, of course, chiefdoms
8. Thus, in traditional Luristan the pastoralist economy gave rise to
stratification (local groups were led by khavanin [princes]), but without the
stability conferred by state institutions. This gave rise to "congeries of turbulent
tribes ever given to plundering or at feud with each other, but rarely controlled
by capable chiefs" (Sir Aurel Stein, quoted in Black-M ichaud [1986: 83]).
Comparable situations are well attested in Europe (proto-historic Ireland is a good
example). On the peripheries of state power, such social "orders” (if one may call
them that) lasted into modern times (see, for example, George MacDonald Fraser
[1972] on the "reiver economy" of the sixteenth century [A.D.] Scots borderlands.)
9. The Apennine Bronze Age o f central and southern Italy (Barker 1981:
90-102) and the Cogotas I complex of Late Bronze Age Iberia (Fernandez-Posse у
de Arnaiz 1986) seem to be Mediterranean variants of the temperate European
pattern.



Gilman 163
and feudalism are not just structurally similar, but historically sequential.101
The simplest link between the social and economic changes which occurred in
Europe in the third millennium and the dispersal of Indo-European languages into
the continent is that proposed by Marija Gimbutas (1963): the Kurgan people from
the north Caucasus Indo-European homeland introduce intensified livestock
exploitation, hierarchical social institutions, and their language into eastern,
central, and northern Europe. The empirical and methodological difficulties of this
model have been exhaustively discussed in the literature and require no repetition
here. It is simply unwarranted to postulate a fixed link between particular styles
of m aterial culture and particular linguistic groupings. What can be done,
however, is to elucidate the correspondences between the social institutions which
can be reconstructed in the archaeological record and those which can be
reconstructed from the linguistic record. When Thomas Markey (1981: 239)
observes that "totemism and its attendant bestial epithets are non-Indo-European,
but were later acquired by the Indo-Europeans as they integrated the religions of
those they conquered," the prehistorian will note how well this fits with the
contrasts in religious behavior observed in the archaeological record of the
N eolithic and the Bronze Age, respectively. The "oath/ordeal" orientation, which
Markey (1988) notes is characteristic o f Indo-European ideology, corresponds to
the "individualizing" character of Bronze Age rituals.11
In this way, then, without claiming indefensible matches between particular
archaeological assemblages and particular linguistic groupings, one may see the
10. Shennan (1987: 370) seems to believe that an approach such as mine to
the developm ent of social complexity, with its emphasis on the importance of
coercive control over subsistence, postulates "a universal urge to dominance in the
human (m ale) psyche." I make no assumptions about human nature except that it is
variable. In all societies, some individuals (male or female) have such urges. Where
appropriate conditions exist (in my model, technological conditions), greed has the
opportunity to be translated into effective social action.
11. This is part of a broad evolutionary pattern of changing forms of
legitim ation according to which, as Earle (in press) notes, tribal leaders claim
ancestors who emerge from the earth, while chiefs claim ancestors who descend
from the sky.



164 When Worlds Collide
developm ent o f stratified societies in Europe as of the third millennium as
providing the structural conditions for linguistic spread through the processes of
what Renfrew (1987) calls "elite dominance." Renfrew believes that elite dominance
sufficiently effective to impose a new language on a subject population requires
either state-level p olitical organization or significant disparities in military
technology. Such conditions are certainly not attested to in late Neolithic and early
Bronze Age Europe. Accordingly, Renfrew opts for a radical alternative to the
conventional wisdom as to the date and source of Indo-European spread into
Europe. At the same tim e, however, he notes several cases where particular
linguistic displacements may have taken place through dominance of elites whose
bureaucratic and military organization were not much more complex than those
attested to in the European Bronze Age.12 Given the hesitation o f so notable a
processualist as Renfrew (and given the d ifficu lties o f his own "wave of advance"
model), it might be w ell for processualists to develop in greater detail the lessons
which might be gained from a comparative sociology of language spread through
elite dominance.
12. Renfrew (1987: 132) allows that chiefdoms may be sufficiently well
organized to give subject populations incentives to change their languages. He cites
the spread of G aelic into Scotland in the Dark Ages (1987: 164) and the
introduction o f Indo-Iranian languages to India (ibid.: 205) as possible examples of
pre-state linguistic spread through elite dominance.

THE COLLISION OF TWO IDEOLOGIES
Marija Gimbutas
Professor of European Archaeology
University of California, Los Angeles
The Indo-European culture, with its patriarchal and classed social structure
and its religion o f warrior gods, was superimposed on Europe in several stages:
first in central Europe in 4500-3000 B.C., it spread to the north and south in the
first h alf o f the third m illennium B.C., com ing later to the Aegean and
M editerranean islands. From the third millennium on, h ybridized cultures and
mythologies emerged.
The culture that the Indo-European culture was superimposed on, Old Europe,
with its tens of thousands of figurines, beautifully painted pottery, frescoed
tem ples, and conveniently located towns, disappears. It is replaced instead by
hillforts and weapons and the emergence of a totally different symbolic system.
The recogn ition o f the co llisio n of two ideologies, Old European and
Indo-European, as presented here is based on my research of some thirty years
which can be summed up in the follow ing central points: 1) The definition of
distinct N eolithic and Copper Age Europe o f c. 6500-3500 B.C. as O ld Europe,
opposed to what is known as "Indo-European." 2) The reconstruction of the
complex religious and philosophical system of goddess-worship which was central
to Old European cultures. 3) The recognition of the clash between Old Europe and
the proto-Indo-European Kurgan culture of Volga Neolithic origin and the three
successive infiltrations of the Kurgan horse-riding people into east central Europe
in the period between 4500 and 3000 B.C. which led to the transformation of Old
Europe: the change of the social structure, transition from matrilineal to patrineal
order, from learned theocracy to militant patriarchy, from balanced to unbalanced
society, from the chthonic goddess religion to the Indo-European male-dominated
and sky-oriented pantheon of gods. 4) The formation of the secondary, European,



172 When Worlds Collide
homeland in central Europe, composed of indigenous and Kurgan elem ents.l
European culture, as w ell as that of Anatolia and southern Asia, has two main
constituent ingredients: substratal (Old European) and superstratal (indo-European),
both extant up to the present in language, myth, and symbols. The Old European
and Indo-European b elief system s are diametrically opposed. This fact alone
speaks for the co llisio n , i.e. the intrusive character of the Indo-Europeans in
Europe. There is no possibility o f the Indo-European belief system having evolved
in a straight line from the Old European. There is also no possibility that the
Indo-European society -exogam ic, patriarchal, patrilineal and patrilocal, with
strong clanic organization and social hierarchization which gave prominence to the
priestly and warrior classes -developed from Old European kin-group society
which focused on the harmonious interaction of humans in nature, and of men and
women with each other as complementary.
Old European sym bols are intim ately related to the m oist earth, to her
life-g iv in g waters, to fem ale regenerative organs; they are cyclic as the moon and
the fem ale body. In no way could the philosophy which produced these images be
mistaken for the sky-oriented Indo-European ideology with its horse-riding
warrior gods of thundering and shining sky, or of the swampy underworld, its
gods equipped with lethal weapons, its polar (d ay/nigh t, sh in in g/b lack ,
m ale/fem ale) structuring of the world, its ideology in which female goddesses are
no longer creatrixes, but reduced to mere beauties -"Venuses," brides of the sky
gods.
Summary of functions and images of Old European goddesses and gods
The main theme o f Old European goddess symbolism is the mystery of birth1

Francisco, 1989, and G oddess’ Civilization. Europe before the Patriarchy. Beacon
Press: forthcoming.



Gimbutas 173
and death, and the renewal o f life, involving not only human life but all life on
earth. Symbols and images cluster around the parthenogenetic (self-generating)
Goddess. She was the single source of all life who took her energy from the
springs and wells, from the moon, sun and earth, and from the animals and plants.
Her basic functions were as G iver-of-L ife, W ielder-of-Death, Regeneratrix, and
the Earth Fertility Goddess, rising and dying with plant life. Male gods also exist,
but not as creators: they are guardians or owners of wild nature, or they are
metaphors of life energy and vegetation spirit. Table I.
Summary of functions and images of Indo-European gods and goddesses
The proto-Indo-European pantheon of gods was organized to a socially and
econom ically oriented ideology: the prominent sovereign, priestly, and warrior
classes were suited to the predominant role o f pastoralism in their mixed farming
economy, with the special emphasis on the horse. Their principal male gods rode
horses and carried weapons. Life-creating and death-wielding functions belonged
to the principal male gods. Female goddesses, like the Dawn and Sun Maiden, are
not creatrixes, but are brides or wives of male gods. The religion was oriented
toward the rotating sun and other sky phenomena, such as thunder and lightning.
Their sky gods shone "bright as the sky.” In Bronze Age representations they
carried shining weapons -daggers, swords, and shields -and were adorned with
copper or gold chest plates, gold or amber discs, and copper-plated belts.
On the other hand, the god of death was a frightening black god of the
underworld. The Indo-Europeans glorified the swiftness of arrow and spear and
the sharpness o f the blade. The touch of the axe blade awakened the powers of
nature and transmitted the fecundity of the god (Thunder god); by the touch of his
spear tip, the god of death and the underworld marked the hero for glorious death.
Time was conceived as an inexorable onward movement, as a "wheel track."
The horse draws the wheel o f the four seasons, and o f the day, from morning to
night. The sky is seen as a hill: the movement o f the sun is up the hill and down,
as it is drawn in a vehicle (later a chariot), by horses who never tire. The sun in
Indo-European languages is called "the runner," "the tireless racer," "the seesaw," or
"the horse."



174 When Worlds Collide
There w ere three main gods, none subordinated to the others. Each is
intimately associated with domesticated animals: horse, bull and he-goat. There
was no one Great God as there was one Great Goddess; however, the God of the
Shining Sky in some Indo-European mythologies appears as a "summus deus," the
most important one. The images associated with this god are the most numerous.
Table II.
Summary of beliefs in afterlife
The two systems exhibit two very different sets of beliefs in an afterlife.
Old European
A strong b elief in cyclic regeneration is reflected in neolithic burial rites. The
pervasive idea in grave architecture is Tom b is Womb. G raves are oval,
egg-shaped, oven-shaped, uterus-shaped, or anthropomorphic. The latter being
con ceived as the body o f the Goddess. The generative triangle also figures in
grave and shrine outlines and architecture. Symbols on stones of megalithic graves
are sym bols of regeneration, life-g iv in g water, and life energy (cupmarks,
concentric circles with central dot, concentric arcs, winding snakes, snake coils,
bullheads as uteri, triangles, lozenges, hourglass shapes, zigzags, lunar cycles); or
images of the Goddess of Regeneration with labyrinths, vulvas, breasts.
There is a barrier o f water between this world and the next, which is crossed
by ships, them selves symbols o f regeneration. The location of the afterworld is in
the West. Life after death is pleasant, enjoyable.
Indo-European
There is a linear continuity from this life to the afterlife. Therefore mortuary
houses were built, and the dead take their belongings, tools, weapons, ornaments,
according to their rank, to the afterworld. Gifts provide the dead with status.
Royal tombs and those of other important members of the society are lavishly
equipped. The kings and chieftains are buried with people (w ife, servants,



Gimbutas 175
children) and animals (horses, teams o f oxen, dogs). Death in battle is glorified.
G ifts of food continue to be made after the funeral: necessary to the w ell-being of
the shades.
The otherworld is underground, swampy, ruled by the male sovereign god. It
is gloom y, chilly, sterile. The journey to the otherworld involves a road or a river,
and usually a three day period of walking, riding, or travel in chariots. Souls
remain there and drift in a pale and passive manner. There is no belief in rebirth
or continuity o f life energy in other living beings as in Old Europe. Such
different b eliefs o f the Indo-Europeans could not have developed from the Old
Europeans. With the formation o f the Baden-Ezero culture in east central Europe
and the Globular Amphora in northern central Europe in the second half of the
fourth millennium B.C., the Indo-European mode of burial and beliefs in the other
world take root in Europe and gradually replace the communal burial o f the Old
European type.
The contrast between Old European and Indo-European symbols
The analysis o f Old European and Indo-European symbols shows that the two
religions and m ythologies had entirely different sets of symbols. Both sets are still
extant today in the m ythologies and folklore of Europe. Below, I shall give just a
few exam ples, not the whole glossary o f symbols. Examples are taken from the
animal world, sky bodies, and colors. Table III.
Conclusion
The above summaries o f functions and images o f gods, of beliefs in afterlife, and
the different sets of symbols prove the existence of two religions and mythologies,
the Old European indigenous, inherited from the Paleolithic, the Indo-European
intrusive, related to the Near Eastern. Their collision in Europe resulted in the
hybridization o f two symbol structures. The Indo-European prevailed, but the Old
European survived as an undercurrent. Without the insight into the different
sym bolic structures, the ideologies of the European peoples, and the genesis and
meaning of symbols, beliefs, and myths cannot be comprehended.

The Postulated Pre-Indo-European Substrates in Insular Celtic and Tocharian1 Karl Horst Schmidt (Bonn University)
In discussing the causes of linguistic change in the IE languages, two factors
are generally mentioned: 1. system conditioned, so-called intralinguistic reasons
which are determined by the interdependence between economy and function. This
finds expression in phrases lik e la loi du m oindre e ffo r t and le besoin de
s'exprimer (Martinet 1955, 21); 2. extralinguistic reasons brought about by Contact
and Interference (Weinreich 1964, 1). My paper is concerned with the latter.
The interference caused by Languages in Contact, Haugen’s replica12, can be
shown on two levels: a) borrowing and adaptation of concrete linguistic substance
from the m odel language by the rep lica language: loan w ords, h ybrids, loan
translations (caiques linguistiques) or sem antic loans (cf. Haugen 1972, 165) can
result in a restructuring of the inherited vocabulary. Besides, as reliable evidence
of language contacts, they are of special importance for the history of a language,
b) Structural and typological transformation of the phonological and grammatical
sybsystems resulting from the influence of foreign substrates on the expanding IE
tribes. The process has been described by Deeters 1958, 155 as follows: "Die
zunachst zweisprachige unterworfene Bevolkerung paBt die fremde Sprache dem
phonologischen System der eigenen an; Phoneme, die dieser fehlen, werden durch
ahnliche ersetzt (Lautsubstitution). Auch der Sprachbau kann umgestaltet werden,
indem K ategorien der alten Sprache in die neue hineingetragen werden, ihr
fr em d a rtig e au sgesch ied en werden. Je mehr sich im L aufe der Z eit die
unterworfene Bevolkerung numerisch und sozial durchsetzt, desto starker treten

diese Ziige hervor."3 As exam ples o f IE languages influenced by pre-IE substrates,
Deeters, l.c., cites Sanskrit, Armenian and Greek, while my talk, which is restricted
to morphology and syntax, deals with Tocharian and Insular Celtic. The paper
consists of five parts:
1. On the typology o f possibly non-IE features in Tocharian and Insular Celtic
morphology and syntax
2. On the problem of identifying non-IE contact languages
3. On the position of Tocharian and Insular Celtic within the IE language family
as a criterion for dating possible contacts with non-IE languages
4. On the distribution of archaisms and innovations in Tocharian and Insular Celtic
5. Summary
1. On the typ o logy o f p o ssib ly non-IE features in Tocharian and Insular Celtic
morphology and syntax
a) Tocharian
As to phonology, the merger of the three IE occlusive series (voiceless, voiced,
voiced aspirate) into voiceless consonants may just be mentioned in passing.4 Van
3. Cf. also Lewy (1913) 1961, 4, whose theory, however, is d ifficu lt to
prove because it is not explicit: "und je inniger die Eingewohnung wird, d.h. je
mehr Zeit vergeht, desto starker wird sich die alteinheimische geistige Art in der
neuen, einst fremden Sprache durchsetzen; desto ahnlicher werden die jiingeren
Stufen der M ischsprache der alten, nun langst verklungenen einheim ischen
Muttersprache werden." Similarly Wagner 1959, 242: "Das Formprinzip der Sprache
auBert sich im Kategoriensystem und ist durch die Geistesstruktur des Menschen
b estim m t." S c h o n f e ld e r ’s a rg u m en t, 1956, 67: "daB auch im F a lle ein er
Volkermischung und eines daraus resultierenden Sprachwechsels des einen Volkes
keine direkte m orphologische B eeinflussung der Siegersprache durch die
unterliegende Sprache eintritt," is unconvincing.

W indekens 1976, 76 calls this process assourdissem ent5, while Gamkrelidze/Ivanov
1984, 400, on the basis o f their different reconstruction o f series I (cf. no. 1),
evaluate it partly as an archaism: "Jazyki soxranivsie seriju I bez posledujescego
ozvocenija (germanskij, armjanskij, verojatno, anatolijskij i toxarskij), mogut
rassm atrivat’sja как soxran ivsie arxaizm sistemy i blizkie v etom otnosenii к

A s to m o rp h ology, M e ille t’s p rin c ip le s till holds: "Le v erb e est tout
indo-europeen. La flexion nominate a perdu, il est vrai, presque tous les traits
indo-europeens’ (M eillet 1914, 12). The change from inflecting to agglutinative
lan gu age typ e is the most im portant developm ent in Tocharian nom inal
m orphology6, although the latter does not extend to the nominative, accusative
(oblique) and genitive cases. The agglutinative structure of the so-called secondary
ca ses, instrum ental (rep laced by the p erlative in Tocharian B), perlative,
com itative, allative, ablative, locative and causalis7, which d evelop ed from
postpositions (cf. Krause/Thomas 1960, 78), corresponds to the principle of
orders established by Gleason 1966, 112: "mutually exclusive classes o f morphemes
occupying definable places in the sequence of morphemes forming a word":
(2) A ka$$i ‘m agister,’ o 1 : ob liq u e case k'as^i-rri ~ k'as$i-n~, o2 : p e r la tiv e
k'a$$i-n-a, com itative k'a$$i-n-ass'al etc.; plural: o 1: oblique case k'a$$i-s, o2:

(1921) 1949, chapter V and Skalicka 1966.
7. On the functional differentiation of these cases cf. Schmidt 1987.



182 When Worlds Collide
ka$$i-s-a, ka$$-s-assal etc.8
This m orphological system with the oblique case as the basis for the
secondary cases (no. 2) corresponds typologically to the inflection on the principle
o f two bases (po p rin cip u dvux osnov) established for the East Caucasian
languages o f the Daghestan by M agometov 1965, 97: "ot im enitel’nogo padeza
(padeza samogo po sebe neoformlennogo ...) obrazuetsja ergativ, a ergativ lezit v
osnove kosvennyx padezej."
As to syntax, the agglutinative declension of Tocharian exhibits the same
correlations as that of Ossetic, which, however, carried out the change from
inflective to agglutinative type more com pletely, i.e. including the grammatical
cases:
(3) Ossetic sg. : pi. nom. seer ‘head’ : scer-t-ce, gen. scer- э : scer-t- э etc.
In both languages we encounter Gruppenflexion (‘group inflection’)9 instead of
inherited Autonomie des Wortes (‘word autonomy’)10:1
(4) A kuklas (oblique) yukas (oblique) ohk'almas-yo (instr.) ‘with carriages, horses
and elephants,’ asdn ikam 9oblique) M etrakn -ass'al (com it.) ‘together with the
venerable Maitreya’11

9. On the term G ruppen flexion cf. Finck 1910, 154, who mentions three
in flectin g types in the strict sense o f the word; "den griechischen. . .stamm
flek tieren d en ," "den arabischen. . .w urzelflektierenden," "den georgischen. .
.gruppenflektierenden."
10. Cf. the definition o f the term Autonomie des Wortes by Deeters 1957,
14: "jedes Wort des Satzes ist selbstaendig und traegt an sich die Formantien, die
sein e Beziehung zu einem anderen Wort (Kondordanz) oder seine Funktion
innerhalb des Satzes (Flexion) kennzeichnen."

com parison betw een the Tocharian, Modern Armenian and O ssetic noun
declensions cf. Schmidt 1975; 1987a.



Schmidt 183
Postpositions outnumber prepositions12. The arrangement of the parts of the
sentence in the Basic W ord Order SOV, however, must possibly be evaluated as an
archaism13. The tendency to mark the accusative singular of rational beings, which
in West Tocharian (B) is restricted to the masculine gender, does not generally
apply to kinship terms:
(5) AB ka$$i ‘magister,’ obi. ~m vs. В nom. obi. pikul ‘year’; nom. pacer ‘father,’
obi. pat'ar, A nom. obi. p a ts ‘husband,’ В obi. petso; nom. obi. soy ‘son,’ A se\ A
obi. hkat ‘God’; Ossetic mas m ady ragaej nal fedton ‘I haven’t seen my mother
(acc. - gen.) for a long time’14 The marking of the accusative case of rational
beings, which is confirm ed by sim ilar developm ents in Romance, Slavic and
Modern East Armenian15,
(6) Armenian Es tesnum em sard T see the mountain,’ Moron verqreq girk'd ‘Maro
took the book’ vs. Maron verqreq erexayin (acc. = dat.) ‘Maro took the child’16
fits into the frame of an im ata vs. inanim ata. As early as 1925, 49, M eillet
established the principle o f a proto-IE dichotomy of genus commune, i.e. the
generic term for masculine and feminine, vs. genus neutrum: ”Le trait essentiel de
la d istin ction de l ’anim e et de l’inanim e con siste dans la caracteristique de
12. Tocharian prepositions are in general followed by the oblique case (B
sle, A s la ‘with,’ В sn a i, A sn e ‘w ithout’) or restricted to inherited syntagms
(Krause/Thomas 1960, 171), e.g. В ysam na ‘among men,’ yhakterp ‘among gods’;
postpositions, however, are preceded by nouns in various cases.
13. Cf. on the one hand Zimmer 1976, 101, and on the other hand Schmidt
1972; 1975, 285.
14. Cf. Abaev 1964, 18: genitive used as the "direct object (for definite and
personal beings)". As to the etymology of -m (in kajsi-m etc.) cf. Krause/Thomas
1960, 109; Schmidt. 1989, 22ff.
15. As to the Armenian, cf. Abeghian 1936, 63: "Bei Substantiven, die ein
verntinftiges Wesen bezeichnen und zugleich auch bestimmt sind, ist der Akkusativ
im OA dem Dativ gleich. Im WA ist er immer gleich dem Nominativ."
16. Cf. Garibjan 1958, 59; 57.



184 When Worlds Collide
l’accusatif anime, au singulier et au pluriel. A systematic approach to this question
on the basis of the distinction anim ate vs. inanimate was attempted a few years
ago by V illar 1983, 181ff.17. Accusative marking of animate nouns is also attested
in non-IE languages, a fact that caused Comrie to establish the principle "that
separate accusative marking and verb object agreement are more likely with noun
phrases that are high in animacy or definiteness." When applied to ergative
languages, this rule im plies Silverstein’s hypothesis (1976, 122): "If an ergative
system splits sim ply into two two-way case-marking schemes, then minimally
eith er th e [+ eg o ] or the [+ tu] form s are n om in ative-accu sative, the rest
ergative-absolutive."18
As to Tocharian w ord-form ation , the. most important evidence o f non-IE
influences appears to be the word akm al ‘face,’ a tw in-com positum (Bednarczuk
1983,12) ‘ey e-n ose,’ whose two parts express a new totality19. As early as 1927,
Wilhelm Schulze compared the word with non-IE parallels:
(7) Tocharian A ak -m a l ‘face’ (‘eye-nose’) : Ossetic cces-gom ‘face’ {ccest ‘e y e ’
kom ‘mouth’) : Adyghe n a -p e ‘face’ (ne ‘eye’ - p e ‘nose’), Avar ber~ kal ‘face"
( ‘e y e -m o u th ’) : H u n garian o r - c a (o r r ‘n o se’ - s z a j ‘m o u th ’), E s to n ia n
suu-silmad (‘mouth-eyes’) etc.20
17. Cf. the reviews of V illar’s book by Kodderitzsch 1985 and Schmidt
1986 and see also Villar 1984.
18. Cf. also McLendon 1978, 6: "that the system splits common nouns and
personal nouns for which agent function must be marked, from pronouns, kinship
terms and proper names for which patient function must be marked"; Bossong
1980; Mallinson/Blake 1981, 52.
19. Cf. Bouda 1932, 95 referring to Avar ber~kal: ”ber~kal ist ein Kom
positum ‘Auge-Mund,’ die beiden Teile driicken also das Ganze aus."
20. Cf. Schulze (1927) 1966; Bouda 1932, 95ff.; Krause 1951, 197: "(dafiir

Kaukasussprachen oder beide in diesen Bildungen sowie in der agglutinierenden
Kasusrektion auf eine Vorstufe des Tocharischen eingewirkt haben"; Deeters 1963,

Schmidt 185
W ord-pairs consisting o f two substantives are particularly frequent in Tocharian.
Very often they are composed of synonyms:
(8) A m rac s p a ly o ‘with top (and) head’ = ‘with the head’; A n o m -k ly u , В
hem -kalywe ‘name (and) reputation’ = ‘glory’; A arinc paltsak, В arahc p'dlsko (obi.
sg.) ‘heart (and) mind’; A tuhk ynahmune ‘love (and) worship’ etc.21 The IE
parallels quoted by Thomas (1972, 462; 1986, 621) do not exactly correspond to the
type akmal, even in cases where the two parts of the compound are not connected
by a conjunction:
(9) Sanskrit p r a ja y a pasubhih ‘in offspring and cattle’; nrttam gltam’dance and
song’; Greek lcpaStnv m i euuov В 171; nAoutov те m i oAptov Hes. O. 637; Latin
mentem atque animum; English hearth and home etc.
Summing up, the follow ing features o f Tocharian grammar and word-formation
seem to in d ic a te n o n -IE in terferen ce: 1. the ty p o lo g ic a l and fu n ctio n a l
transform ation of the nominal case system demonstrated by agglu tin ative
technique (Sapir 1949, 142ff.), 2. the enlargement of the concrete (adverbial, local)
cases, 3. group inflection on the syntactic level22.
T hese ch a ra c ter istic s d isp rove W inter’s opinion: "Thus far, in sp ite o f
prolonged efforts especially by Wolfgang Krause, no compelling argument for
substratum influence upon Tocharian has been presented, let alone that the specific
substratum responsible for the changes in Tocharian would have been identified"
(1982,3). 4. The East Tocharian gender differentiation of the personal pronouns in
the first person singular:
(10) Nom. obi. sg. A na$ (m.), пик (f.) vs. В nds (his) T, me’; gen. sg. A hi (m.),
1985, 148; 1986, 617.

22. Cf. also Schmidt 1969; 1972; 1975; 1987.



186 When Worlds Collide
hani (f.) vs. В hi23and the word-formation type akmal ‘face.’ As to the basic Word
O rder SOV and the frequent use of postpositions, it is rather difficult to decide
whether these features are due to IE inheritance or to substrate influence.24
b) Insular Celtic
In Insular C eltic, most o f the features discussed as pre-IE are o f a syntactic
nature. There are also morphological features, such as the conjugated prepositions
already referred to by Robert Atkinson in 188525 and John Morris Jones in 1900
(l.c. 620):
(11) Welsh ar ‘on’: Sg. 1 arn af (fi) ‘on me,’ 2 arnat (ti), 3m. arno cef), f. arni (hi),
PI. 1 arnom (ni), 2 arnoch (chwi), 3 arnynt (hwy)
A lexico-syn tactical tendency, "die idg. abstrakten Bildungen durch konkrete
Ausdrucke zu ersetzen" (Pokorny 1959, 156) is dealt with by Pokorny 1927, 239ff.:
(12) Modern Irish ta scilling agam ort ‘you owe me a shilling,’ lit.: ‘there is a
shilling at me on you; mo chuid airgid ‘my (part of) money’
On the other hand, the fact that the individual member of a tribe or family cannot
be referred to by the mere singular of the group-name, but needs special marking
(Pokorny 1927, 248f.), is a widespread phenomenon based on the opposition of
collective vs. singulative:
23. Cf. Bednarczuk 1983, 12, referring to "Tibetan and the related
languages."
24. Cf. also Thomas 1986, 622: "Im einzelnen fallt es schwer, bei den zur
Diskussion anstehenden sprachlichen Problemen jeweils exakt zu bestimmen, was
ausschlieBlich als indogermanischer ... Anted zu gelten hat und was allein einem
nichtindogermanischen Substrat zuzuschreiben ist."
25. Cf. Greene 1966, 125: "Robert Atkinson, a linguist of very wide range,
was d iscu ssin g the conjugated prepositions when he said, in 1885, "we are
involuntarily hurried into a different field of languages: these combinations, one
fancies, might be Hebrew or Hungarian, Tibetan or Tamil."



Schmidt 187
(13) Irish t r e n n a i g o r F ir tir e n n ‘(the) Irish’ vs. fe r d (i) fe r a ib Ёгепп ‘one
Irishm an,’ lit. ‘a man from the men o f Ireland,’ fear de m huinntir N e ill ‘one
O’N e ill’; cf. names o f groups used only in the plural: Roman Tribus: R am nes,
T itie s, Luceres; G reek (Homer) ’ApyeToi, A a v a o i,’Axouoi; Russian litv a ‘the
Lithuanians’ vs. litvim , ‘one Lithuanian’; Svan sw an-ar, ‘the Svans’: m u-swan ‘one
Svan’; wonjana gwar ‘(the) Onian fam ily’: m u-wnjan ‘one (member o f the family)
Onian’ etc. 26
Moreover, the evidence o f a tendency to express abstractions in a concrete
manner must also be regarded in the light o f Thurneysen’s assumption that we
have to do with elements o f colloquial speech.27 Some o f the syntactical features
mentioned by Morris Jones (1900) and Pokorny (passim) may also have been
influenced by colloquial speech, e.g.,
a) "The pleonastic use o f a pronominal suffix after a preposition governing a
relative" (Morris Jones 637):
(14) Irish An fear a raibh tu ag caint leis ‘the man whom thou wert talking to him’
b) "The omission of the copula" (Morris Jones 637f.):
(15) Welsh Pwy у marchawc ‘who (is) the knight?’
c) "The am plification o f the negative by a noun placed after the verb, like the
French pas” (Morris Jones 638):
(16) Wesh N i 'th welais dim' je ne t’ai pas vu’
26. Cf. W ackernagel 1926, 86f.; Brauer 1969, 119; Topuria 1967, 77; Onian
1917, 2.
27. Cf. Thurneysen 1930, 428: "Ich habe den Eindruck, man wiirde manches
davon in der Umgangssprache des taglichen Lebens (nicht in der Literatursprache)
vielerorten wiederfinden."



188 When Worlds Collide
d) Juxtaposition of clauses without subordination (Pokorny 1959, 153):
(17) Welsh Aeth allan ac hithau yn oer ‘he went out and it cold’ (‘although it was
cold’)
A charcteristic feature o f Insular Celtic referred to by Wagner is the increasing
tendency in Modern Irish to express stative verbs periphrastically:28
(18) Old Irish ad-agur ‘I fear’: Modern Irish ta eagla orm ‘there is fear on me’
It must be admitted, however, that some comparable examples of periphrasis are
already attested in Old Irish:
(19) Old Irish is go duit ‘you lie ’: Canigoo diiib si anasberid Wb 5a8 ‘Is it not a
lie o f yours what ye say’: Modern Irish is fior dhuit ‘you are right, you tell the
truth’
If such developments have been caused by substrates, the tendency to gradually
transform the structure or type of a language over a relatively long period of time
would confirm the theory established by Deeters 1958, 155: "Je mehr sich im Laufe
der Z eit die unterworfene Bevolkerung numerisch und sozial durchsetzt, desto
starker treten diese Zuge hervor."
Concluding the Insular Celtic section of my paper, I would like to refer to two
important syntactical features which have been discussed as evidence of a pre-IE
substrate: a) the Basic Word Order VSO which Morris Jones 1900, 619 considered
a clear indication of Hamitic influence. Pokorny 1964, a few years before his
28. Cf. Wagner 1959, 127: "daB das Air. zustandliche Bedeutungen noch
weitgehend finit-verbal zum Ausdruck bringt, wahrend sie im Neuir, in nom
inalisierter Form erscheinen.”



Schmidt 189
death, defended the substrate theory against attempts at explaining VSO on the
basis o f an IE development;29 b) initial mutations such as lenition and nasalization
which arise within the context of the phrase. These Morphophonemic changes were
originally caused by the final of the preceding word. Modifying typological terms,
Pokorny called these changes Anlautflexion, Gruppenflexion or Aufgabe der
Autonomie des Einzelwortes (loss o f the autonomy of the individual word).30 This
criterion, however, does not prove very much, as the operation of sandhi within
the phrase is a w id e-sp read linguistic phenomenon.31 On the other hand, the
special manner o f expressing ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in Insular Celtic has been taken as an
indication o f a close connection between question and answer:32
(20) Welsh A w eli d i у ty? G w elaf ‘Do you see the house?’ T see’ (English T do,
yes’); Modern Irish Ar bhuail se thu? ‘Did he beat you?’ Do bhuail ‘he beat’ (=‘yes’),
N ior bhuail ‘he did not beat’ (= ‘no’)
2. On the problem o f identifying non-IE contact languages
The substrate hypothese put forward by scholars such as Morris Jones, Pokorny or
Wagner have often met with scepticism33 both for linguistic and extralinguistic
reasons: as to the former, it stands to reason that morphological evidence such as
the appearance of agglutinative inflection in Tocharian carries more weight than
syntactical and semantic structures. The extralinguistic situation, e.e. the lack of
concrete evid en ce from the postulated substrate languages, has an even more
unfavourable effect on the hypotheses. Evans has seen this problem in connection
w ith the unknown date o f C eltic im m igration to the British Isles: "For the
pre-Roman period the question of language contact is exceedingly problematic,
having to do with unknown non-C eltic and pre-C eltic substrata as w ell as the
com plex and vexed question o f the ‘coming’ of the celts. It relates to the problem
29. Cf. especially Watkins 1963.
30. Cf. Pokorny 1927, 231ff; 1959, 154.
31. Cf. e.g., Allen 1972; Oftedal 1985; Andersen 1986.

190 When Worlds Collide
o f the separating out and emergence o f Celtic languages at an unknown period in
contact with other languages about which we have no direct and secure evidence"
(1986, 106).
As to the identification of concrete material, the theory already established by
Morris Jones in 1900, 618, "neo-Celtic syntax agrees with Hamitic on almost every
point where it differs from Aryan" was initially accepted by Pokorny, but greatly
weakened later on by the assumption of further substrates (i.e. West Caucasian and
Basque). It must be admitted, however, that comparison with West Caucasian is
irrelevan t, as none of the various Ibero-Caucasian hypotheses has been
substantiated.34 The Basque theory, which is also difficult to prove, was presented
by Pokorny 1949, 24S: "Zusammen mit dem Baskischen enthalt das Irische
zahlreiche deutliche Spuren der lhngst verschwundenen Sprachen der voridg.
Bewohner Westeuropas."
Although no attempt at identifying concrete substrates in Insular Celtic has
been successful thus far, two linguistic arguments speak in favor o f the existence
o f pre-IE substrates: a) the opposite direction taken by the transformations in
Tocharian and Insular Celtic35: it does not seem probable that the typological
d i f f e r e n c e s —S O P p lu s a g g lu tin a tiv e d eclen sio n vs. V S O p lu s in f le c tiv e
declension—developed without any influence from contact languages. It may be
added that the impact o f non-IE (Finno-Ugrian, perhaps also Caucasian and other
substrates) on Tocharian is better substantiated36 than the postulated substrates of
Insular C eltic, b) The second argument is the typological difference between
Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic manifest in the Basic W ord O rder VSO in
Insular C eltic in spite o f the very close genetic connection between Gaulish and
Brittonic:
(21) Insular Celtic VSO : Gaulish SVO (and a few instances of SOV) : Celtiberian

3. On the position o f Tocharian and Insular Celtic within the IE language fam ily
as a criterion for dating possible contacts with non-IE languages
This section is based on two considerations: a) Leskien’s principle (originally
established for genetically related languages) (1876, XIII): "Die Kriterien einer
en geren G em einsch aft konnen nur in positiven U ebereinstim m ungen der
betreffenden Sprachen, die zugleich Abweichungen von den ubrigen sind, gefunden
werden"; b) the extension o f this principle to common language contacts which
genetically related languages had with foreign substrates or adstrates. To put it the
other way round, if one o f the gen etically related contact languages has an
innovation due to substrate influence which the other lacks, this may provide
information as to the time of the contacts of each language with the substrate or
adstrate. The application of this consideration to Insular Celtic is comparatively
simple: Insular Celtic innovations which Continental Celtic lacks may possibly be
of pre-Celtic, perhaps pre-IE origin. Continental Celtic cannot be fully compared
with Insular Celtic because, notwithstanding the important discoveries of the last
15 years-B otorrita, Chamalieres, Larzac (cf. e.g., Schmidt 1986b )-, its state of
attestation remains very fragmentary. For the same reason, criteria such as e.g., the
inflected prepositions (no. 11) or the periphrastic expression of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ (no.
20) carry less weight than the B asic W ord O rder (no. 21) as a typological
consideration.
The position o f Tocharian is much more difficult to define, since the time and
circumstances o f its emergence are unknown. Henning’s theory, "in spite of its late
appearance, Tokharian is a relatively archaic form of Indo-European. This claim37

Kodderitzsch’s (1985) interpretation of Peiialba de Villastar, based on my theory of
the B asic W ord O rder SOV (Unterm ann 1987 and 1987a, 189), and of my
interpretation of Botorrita (Untermann 1987) introduces irrelevancies but does not
even discuss the syntactic criterion SOV which (for Botorrita) has now been
con firm ed by J.F. E ska, "Towards an Interpretation o f the H ispano-C eltic

im plies that the speakers of this group separated from their Indo-European
brethren at a com paratively early date" (1978, 217)38, is shared in principle by
G am krelidze/Ivanov 1984, 369ff. The two Soviet scholars postulate an Anat
olian-T ocharian-Italo-C eltic group, from which first Anatolian and then Tocharian
branched o ff. Nevertheless, the investigation of its position within the IE language
fam ily remains a d ifficu lt task. The statement made by M eillet in 1914 "on ne se
trompera sans doute pas beaucoup en attribuant au tokharien une place
interm6diaire entre l’italo-celtiqu e d’une part, le slave et l’armenien d’autre” (cf.
M eillet 1914, 17) could not take into account the isoglosses between Tocharian and
Hittite which to a certain extent consist of IE archaisms:
(22) A e-, В a i- ‘to give’ : Hittite p a i- < *pa~ai—, A у a - ‘to do’ : Hittite iia - \ A В
y o k - ‘to drink’ : Hittite eku-\ A k a st-, В kest ‘hunger’ : H ittite kast-; cf. also A
por ‘fire’ < *paur : Hittite pahhur39 A tkam, В кет ‘earth’ : Hittite tekan40
A fter evaluating the then known evidence from Hittite and Tocharian, Holger
Pedersen 1925, 52 arrived at the conclusion "que 1’italo-celtique, le phrygien, le
tokharien et le hittite ont constitue dans une antiquite reculee un groupe continu
de dialectes de la langue-mere."41 On the other hand, Walter Petersen’s far-reach
ing theory "Hittite and Tocharian must have constituted for some time a dialectic
unity" has not been accepted. Benveniste, after stressing the archaic character of
Tocharian (1936, 228), establishes the theory "le tokharien est un membre ancien
d ’un groupe prehistorique (auquel appartenait p eu t-etre aussi le hittite) qui
confinait d’une part au baltique et au slave, de 1’autre au grec, a l’armenien et au
thraco-phrygien" (l.c. 237). In his recent report on the position of Tocharian within
the IE language family, Thomas 1985, 128ff. takes into account almost all the IE

languages. As to the Tocharian homeland, he follow s (1986, 623) Benveniste 1936,
238 ("en gros, la region des steppes qui s’etend au sud-est de la Russie jusqu’a
l ’O ural”) and Krause 1951, 200: "Es erscheint nach alledem m oglich, ... die
Urheim at (oder genauer eine Zwischenheim at) der Tocharer in einem Gebiet
ungefahr zwischen Dnjepr und Ural, also ostwarts in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft
der Finnogrier zu suchen und anzunehmen, dad die Sprache der nachmaligen
Tocharer zu einer gewissen Zeit bei ihrer Wanderung gen Osten nicht allein mit
baltisch-slaw ischen, sondern auch mit finnisch-ugrischen Stammen und Sprachen
mindestens an deren sudlichem Saum in Beriihrung gekommen ist." Thomas 1985,
136f. cites, for instance, the follow ing Baltic and Slavic coincidences with
Tocharian:
(23) a) Palatalization; b) a-preterite: В taka ‘became’ :
Lithuanian buvo ‘was,’ s e jo ‘sow ed,’ Old Church Slavonic Ьъга ‘collected ’;42 c)
infinitive in AB -ts i, Baltic and Slavic -</;43d) /-suffix: В yamaqs'alle ‘facie'ndus’:
OCS nesH jesrrvh ‘I have done,’ Armenian sirel ‘to love,’ sireli ‘lovable’44 etc.; e)
adjectives in -$ i (A), -qqe (B) < *-sk yo s : cm ol-si, cmel-qe ‘referring to birth’ :
OCS iiste, Armen, -aqi : dark' ‘door’ : dr-aqi ‘neighbor.’45
The conclusiveness of these and other arguments is, however, limited for at
least two reasons: a) the etymology is not always undisputed; b) most of the
isoglosses are not limited to Tocharian and Baltic and/or Slavic, but occur in other
la n g u a g es as w e ll. T h erefo re Bednarczuk 1983, 13 seem s to go too far in
maintaining "On the Indo-European background the greatest typological similarity
to Tokharian is shown by Balto-Slavic, especially Russian and East-Baltic, which
have probably been formed also on the Uralic substratum.”46 In this context one
might refer to Lewy’s B etrachtung des Russischen (1925), which results in the
sta tem en t: "Es sc h e in t m ir ... nicht m oglich , d ie Id en titat ein er A nzahl

might perhaps provide addition- al arguments for the existence o f Finno-Ugrian
substrates.
4. On the distribution o f archaisms and innovations in Tocharian and Insular Celtic
The preceding observations have shown that the Tocharian and Insular Celtic
innovations are concentrated on different linguistic categories: agglutinative
declension with group inflection in Tocharian vs. B asic W ord O rder VSO,
in flectiv e declen sion , conjugated prepositions and a tendency to nominal
periphrastic expression o f stative verbs in Insular Celtic. Conservative features
common to both language groups apply to the finite verb with its categories of
person, tense, mood and diathesis. A remarkable similarity is the use of atonic
pronouns, infixed and suffixed in Insular Celtic and suffixed in Tocharian:
(24) Old Irish ro-m 'gab ‘he has taken me,’ n -d g n iu -sa T do it,’ beirth -i ‘he bears
it,’ morth-us ‘he exalts her’; Tocharian В winaskau-c = A winasam-ci T adore you.’47
As to the relative chronology of preterite, medium and imperfect, both
Tocharian and Celtic no longer correspond to the older IE type represented by
Greek or Indo-Iranian. The aorist and the perfect have merged into a preterite48,
the medial functions49 (with passive function in Tocharian) have been neutralized,
and imperfect paradigms have been developed. To what degree these processes
took place in the Continental Celtic languages as well is difficult to determine
because o f our fragmentary evidence.50 These innovations, like the replacement of
the о-stem nom inative plural ending -o s by the pronominal ending - o i (an
an alogical change which did not take place in Celtiberian), correspond to

Schmidt 195
developm ents w ide-spread in IE. An archaic feature common to Tocharian and
Celtic is the differentiation of masculine and feminine gender o f the numbers ‘3’
and ‘4’:
(2 5 ) W elsh tr i, ta ir ‘3’; p e d w a r , p e d a ir ‘4’; Old Irish tri. teo ir *3’; ce th (a )ir,
cetheoir ‘4’; Tocharian В trad., tarya; stwer, stwara; A tre, tri; stwar (m., f.)
An archaic feature peculiar to Tocharian is the preservation of present and
preterite participles.51 Insular Celtic, on the other hand, lacks a fully developed
infinitive category and a verb ‘to have.’52 Celtic vocabulary displays archaisms in
the words for ‘king,’ ‘queen,’ ‘to b elieve’ and ‘to drink’ (no. 26), which have been
discussed as isoglosses between Italic, Celtic and Indo-Iranian since Kretschmer
1896, 125ff.
(26) IE *reg-s, *reg-rii; *kred-dheh1; *pi-ph3-e -ti
Within the Tocharian vocabulary, the Hittite-Tocharian isoglosses (no. 22) occupy
a special position.
5. Summary
a) The main features caused by substrate influences in Tocharian are agglutinative
declension, group inflection and the development of a localistic case system (with
locative, ablative, allative, perlative). Its Basic Word Order SOV may turn out to
be inherited from IE. Insular Celtic features which do not correspond to the IE
type are the Basic W ord Order VSO, conjugated prepositions and an increasing
tendency towards periphrasis.
b) Although the identification of non-IE substrate languages is difficult in the case
o f Tocharian and quite impossible for Insular Celtic, both languages must have had

196 When Worlds Collide
contacts with pre-IE substrates. In Celtic, the differences between Continental
Celtic, which is attested in antiquity, and Insular Celtic, going back to the early
M iddle A ges, may be partly explained as the result of a pre-IE influence on
Insular Celtic. M oreover, the divergent transformations of Tocharian and Insular
Celtic may be plausibly explained as a result of their different substrates.
c) The different Basic W ord Order of such closely related languages as Gaulish
(predom inantly SVO) and Brittonnic (VSO) may be an indication of substrate
influence on Insular Celtic. As to Tocharian, the question of a Finno-Ugrian
substrate needs to be thoroughly investigated.
d) In the developm ent of the verbal systems, both languages generally follow
w ide-spread IE patterns. Archaisms preserved in both languages are evidence by
the differentiation o f masculine and feminine gender in the numbers ‘3’ and ‘4’ and
by the use o f infixed and suffixed pronouns. Celtic and Tocharian differ as to
other archaic features, i.e. vocabulary (see no. 26 for Insular Celtic and no. 22 for
Tocharian), Basic W ord Order (SOV in Tocharian vs. VSO in Insular Celtic), the
lack o f a fully developed infinitive and of a verb ‘to have’ in Insular Celtic and
the preservation o f participles in Tocharian.

THE MAKE-UP OF THE ARMENIAN UNCLASSIFIED SUBSTRATUM
John A. C. Greppin
(Cleveland State University)
The Armenian substratum is a many splendored constellation, made from
those languages form erly spoken in easternmost Anatolia. They first entered
Armenian during the prehistoric period, certainly by the beginning of the first
m illennium BC, and continued their impulses up to the present day. The best
known early com ponent is the Iranian, a stratum that first appeared during the
Parthian period in the mid first millennium and which has been well described
since the time o f Hubschmann (Armenisch Grammatik, 1897), though considerably
refined in the etym ological works of Hratchia Adjarian (H ayeren arm atakan
bararan, Yerevan 1926-1935). This Iranian infestation has continued throughout the
life o f the Armenian language and such a word as Arm. p'law can be shown to be
a m edieval intrusion, from Per. j L p la w ‘p ila f,’ just as such a word as Arm.
asluac ‘god,’ apparently intruded during the most early period of Iranian contract
(B ailey 1985). G reek and Syriac also had their place in the early Armenian
lexicon, stemming from the beginning of the Christian period (405 and following).
But this intrusion was, by and large, a literary one, com prising words that
appeared in the Armenian translation of Greek and Syriac religious texts. An odd
exam ple is Arm. bosor ‘blood’ which is a Hebrew word, ГП22 (batsrah), mistaken
in the Greek w ritings o f St. Cyril of Jerusalem as a word meaning ‘red, bloody’
and carried over as Arm. bosor ‘blood’ by a bewildered Armenian translator from
St. C yril’s p o o o p . A nd though som e words settled firm ly into the common
Armenian lexicon (Syr. f»j [daral ‘age, century,’ Gk. Aupa ‘pound’), most words
were not actively used, or were o f narrow ecclesiastical function (Gk. кабоЯисос;,
Syr. iNi* (sabbe&a ) ‘sabbath.’)
Starting perhaps in the fourteenth century Turkish words made their entrance,
but before them, certainly from the ninth century, Arab words came in, many of
them part o f the vocabulary of the natural sciences that the Armenians were
acquiring. There were Caucasian words, too, frequently Georgian, the language of
a people who had an energetic intellectual class and a vital literature that began



204 When Worlds Collide
to appear not long after that o f the Armenian. Lesser Caucasian languages
necessarily made their intrusion, too, words noted in Udi, Lezghian and other of
the East Caucasian languages, though their path into Armenian cannot be clearly
drawn. The last major intrusion was European, described first as ‘Frankish’; those
were the words o f the Crusaders that had an effect: Arm. baron ‘sir, mister’ is one
of the most vigorous o f that later infusion.
A ltogether, we can account for the origin o f about three quarters of the
Armenian vocabulary, either from Indo-European or by loan from a known source;
the remaining one fourth, though, is a yawning and intriguing void. For the most
part it represents vocabulary that existed in Armenian from the earliest fifth
century, in the Bible or other primary texts. Some o f it has been identified as
H urro-U rartian, and Luw ian has been suggested for a sm aller part. The
H urro-U rartian part seems clear, and we need only cite Hurr. hinzuri, A rm .
x n jo r ‘apple,’ or Urartian ult'u, Arm. ult ‘cam el.’ From Luwian we can suggest
wasu ‘good.’ Arm. vas ‘bravo’; HL a p a ra n ti ‘future,’ Arm. aparn i ‘id.’ Numerous
other words are known from the Hittite lexicon: Hitt, kurkurai- ‘maim, mutilate,’
Arm. k'rk'rem ‘destroy.’
But those words that can be cited in Hurro-Urartian and Luwian (or Hittite)
are actually few; at best we have diagnosed thirty Luwian and Hittite words, and
the H urro-U rartian com ponent num bers only fifte e n . And though the
Hurro-Urartian component is not excessively small, recalling the limited corpus of
Hurrian and Urartian vocabulary we have, the Hittite and Luwian segments are
somewhat lim ited, bearing in mind the considerable bulk of that vocabulary which
we now control. The Hittite and Luwian component, if it is legitimate, must reflect
only a trivial contact with the Luwians in Cilician area during the first millennium
BC. The Hurro-Urartian component, however, is relatively more vigorous, and is
supported by the contact between the early Armenians and the Urartians in early
historical times. We should in time be able to expand this lexical component more.
W hatever their source, these words o f the unknown substratum have a wide
semantic spread. For the purpose o f this paper, I have examined all the roots in
Armenian beginning with the letter b -. That vocabulary can be derived from the
same sources —Indo-European, Iranian, Greek, Syriac, Arabic, Caucasian, Turkish
and F ran k ish - as can the whole of the Armenian vocabulary. And for words

With the technology w e have had up till now, having exhausted our lexical
inventories o f H urro-U rartian and H ittito-Luwian, there has been no way to
analyze more fu lly this unknown bulk of Armenian vocabulary. However, with the
developm ent o f a comparative phonology for the East Caucasian languages, and an
etym ological dictionary based on that phonological study though not yet in print,
we now have a way potentially to recreate lost Hurro-Urartian vocabulary. This
will surely give us insights into this bulk o f words beginning with Arm. b-.
The process that will reconstruct this new vocabulary is dependent on the
theory (D iak on off and Starostin 1983) that Hurrian and Urartian are ancient
members o f what is now the East Caucasian (EC) group. We thus can construct a
P roto-H urro-U rartian/P roto-E ast Caucasian (PHU-PEC) that summarizes both
those ancient cuneiform languages as well as those twenty-five living languages of
the Eastern Caucasus. These latter are broken down into five groups:



Greppin 209
1. Avar
2. Andi (Andi, Botlikh, Godoberi, Karata, Bagval, Tindi, Chamalal)
3. Dido (Dido, Khvarsh, Hinukh, Bezhty, Hunzib)
4. Lak and Dargwa
5. Lezghian (Archi, Tabasaran, Agul, Rutul, Tsakhur, Budukh, Khinalug, Udi,
Lezghian, Kryz)
Selecting, from any o f the living languages o f the East Caucasus, a word that
approaches in shape an Armenian word, yet because of the differences in shape
cannot be a loan word into Armenian from the EC languages, we would take that
word back to its possible Proto-EC form; from there we can recreate a Proto-HU
form, and ultim ately a theoretical Hurrian or Urartian form. If this reconstructed
HU form corresponds to an extant Armenian form, we can argue that this
reconstructed term constitutes the form o f the H U word that came into Armenian
by loan in the first millennium BC or earlier. Thus, though we cannot offer, in this
present paper, further solutions to the problems o f the Armenian substrat, we can
propose a new methodology for seeking it out.
A diagram o f that movement is as follows:

THE INDO-EUROPEAN HORSE
By Eric P. Hamp
Sadly, to the memory of George Walsh
The sheep was in some measure (as was also the goat) domesticated about 11000 years ago. This is a date well before our assured reconstruction of IndoEuropean, or Indo-Hittite, and almost surely before the earliest level to which our internal reconstructions of PIE, with or without a version of the glottalic theory, would lead us. The horse belongs to a much later level of domestication, to as early as the sixth millennium B.C. (Bokonyi 1987:136). That date corresponds closely to the time level that we must assume for our classical PIE reconstructions, with or without an Indo-Hittite genetic node or time elapse. The morphology of our Indo-European reconstructions corresponds well to this archaeological chronology. I have pointed out some time ago (Science 179, 30 March 1973, 1279-80; that morphologically*gw e ?w-'bovine,' * ?weui- 'sheep' (:Arm. hovi-w 'shepherd'), *sulH - 'swine,' and *fcuon - 'dog1display old-layer Indo-European configurations, while *eUuo - 'horse' betrays a much more recent morphology in the prehistory of Indo-European; that while the former group (esp. the first two terms) are structurally opaque, the term for the horse is visibly "not a simplex, but a derivative of something else," and as a thematic stem represents a rather recent layer of noun formation; that the structural linguistic chronology strikingly paralleled that indicated by the radiocarbon measurements then available. A t that time I was not prepared to hazard a guess at the source of the derivation which yielded *еКио-. I believe that I have meantime learned sufficiently



212 When Worlds Collide
more of the grammatical rules of Indo-European noun (and adjective) derivation to make a worthwhile conjecture for this instance. That is to say, I propose a semantically plausible source in the known Indo-European lexicon, an analysis of the structure of that source, a known grammatical rule to operate on that structure (all of these observations respecting known phonological constraints and developments) to yield the observed Indo-European output *elcuo- (expressed in conventional terms). We shall start from an adjective meaning 'swift, celer, uelox1; note that our basis of derivation is an adjective, not a verb-base. The phonological shape of this Indo-European adjective is assured by the equation Indie am - = Avest, am - = Gk ukus . Related forms are Lat. o d o r (comparative), Welsh di-awc > diog 'slow, lazy' (a privative, probably an *s-stem). We may therefore reconstruct an Indo-European adjective *oliu-, whose idiosyncrasies have, however, not been sufficient appreciated. Since a form *olal- cannot be in zero grade of any base, this antonymic adjective fails to conform to the canonical shape of its class; see my study of adjectives of this class (Hamp, 1983). "A morphological law," Lingua 61,1-8.
It is also a known rule of Indo-European that such adjectives in *-u- may not be employed as final elements in a compound and that in their stead an *-es- stem appears. Greek conforms to this rule by forming the compound тгобшкпБ , which is attested in Homer in all case inflexions except the gen. pi.; see the attached tabulation of a computer search, which includes some informative fixed locutions. It is of course also possible that тгобикнэ was an innovation in Greek, since this rule was productive at an early stage of that language. However, we must also note the conflicting formation of Indiepram - (pra+), which shows a final u-stem. There can be no doubt that in late Indo-European *дИй- was divergent in its structural form and in its grammatical behavior. We must also ask eventually what the interpretation of the *[o] is to be. I happen to believe that there was no such thing as Indo-European vrddhi outside of a few restricted morphological situations. Therefore, if the sequence were simply *o? we might expect with insertion o fg a resulting *e? > *Гё]. A sequence such as *ho is ruled out since e-insertion would yield *he > *[a]. If *fw were next to the vowel we might expect *e not to appear under any circumstance. As we shall see, at a sufficiently early date offers us a possibility that the foregoing do not. Let us now turn to the Latin evidence,^ in some ways surely the most archaic. Here we find the defective comparative o dor and superlative odssimus, with the archaic hapax oxime; no positive from this base occurs. Remember that in these forms we expect morphologically an e-vocalism; therefore, a stem *fve ?Ic-ios- would be auite in order. Alongside these we have the valuable rare compounded forms acupedius~>and aedpiter, the latter supposedly conflated with aedpio. DELL is surely correct in seeing a zero grade acu- < *olcu- in these forms. The lacking positive to o dor must, therefore, have dropped out either because of its radically different initial which produced suppletion0 or because of an unwanted homophony with 'sharp' or because of both. We see, then, that in late (or earlier?) Indo-European there were two competing forms *olcu- and *3lal-. The latter was certainly the older, and justified by rule; it must have had the earlier, and underlying, shape 7 Ш - . The former was the encroaching form levelled on the distinctive comparative. The presence of both of



Натр 213
these made the stem shape uncertain: either *Base-u- or "‘Base (ending in u-). Speakers could therefore create well formed grammatical complexes at their option in this respect. To summarize thus far:
*^e?k- (> [ok-]) fw?k-u- fwe?ic(-)ufwe?lc(-)u
Note that Latin seems to have conserved such phonological sequences: apio aptus : -epi = Hitt, epzi
< *ap- : *ep< *??p- : *?e?p
4 <fenf-'tooth' : ed- 'eat' =Hitt. ad-ana ; ed< *?d- :*?ed
We must next observe another rule of Indo-European word formation: When a derivative was formed by thematizing a stem other than a verbal base the first vocalism of (he resulting stem was an *e to the exclusion of any other vocalism of the source ste m / Thus
Gk-в^р, Lith. zvens < *ghuer- (< oldnom.?)
- *ghuer-o- > Lat. ferns
So also when a final *u formed part of the base:
*doru (> Sow )- *deru-o- > Welsh denv, OCS drevo f *soru ' - *seru-o- > Welsh herwr
If now we apply this rule to the stem *fw9ku- 'swift' we might on the one hand obtain *fw?1cu-o- > [o?kuo-] or [olcjio-], which however would not carry the characteristic contrastive vocalism nor expected e-timbre of such derivatives. Instead, it appears that the stem was vocalized *fw?lai-o-. Then either *fw was masked by 9 or such initial clusters just simplified. We thus arrive at *?elaio-^ 'the swift one. ^ Is there any memory of this semantic derivation? If a language conserved the derivational process and if the relevant phonological shapes remained intact it is not likely that the tautological sequence "swift horse' = 'the swift swift one' would be current. However, in Helleno-Armenian *?elcuo- somehow diverged^ so that such a qualification would no longer produce a simple transparent tautology. When we consult Homer, we find just such a sequence living on as a productive oral formula, in all possible syntactic cases and with interesting variation in diction. This formula is by no means a frozen or fossilized single rote sequence. It furthermore occurs (mainly in the Iliad) at telling points in the epic, and clustered with other locutions of important force; note, e.g.,U865 at the end of the episode of Patroclus's death. The formula 'swift horses' occurs always plural (not, as it happens, dual). This no doubt reflects in part a merger in semantics, which is well known, of the metonymic use of 'horses' for 'chariot' in the epic. What is not so well recognized is the fact that the



214 When Worlds Collide
Indo-European locution(s) for 'cart, chariot' was/were plurale tantum.12 However, some of the instances certainly represent semantic plurals of 'horse,' e.g., as seen in the important passage (П 865) at the end of the death of Patroclus, confirmed by the adjective а у З р о т о г . This ancient passage could be nearly Indo-European verse;12 a mild inversion, perhaps in the accusative *n-mrtoms or *n-mruoms, would restore a regular metrical sequence.

The term for the swine *suH-appears to me now to be a descriptive appellative within EE; that is, I claim we have here a "root-noun" nomen actoris in the correct zero grade 'breeder (par excellence),' identical with Vedic su-'father, mother,' from the base sii- 'beget, bear' (siite — >siiyate), disambiguated in Indie from su-kara- 'boar, hog.' I thus agree with the deficiently formulated suggestion reproduced by Pokorny IEW 1039, while rejecting his onomatopoetic alternative, always a last refuge if not a specimen of unprincipled nonsense. My remarks in Science did not take up the goat specifically. I now consider that we can in fact recover the correct IE term for 'goat,' seen in Indie aja- and Lith. ozys; the pre-form must be *fog-o-. I have argued the dialectology of 'goat' in a paper before the International Congress of Linguists, Berlin, August 1987. However, this etymon leads us to another appellative *fogo- > *fago- > *(H)ago- (Lat. ago,Gk ауш) 'what is driven.' There must have been constant (local) renewal of this lexeme^in IE.

ARMENIEN ETIRANIEN
UNE THEORIE LINGUISTIQUE PASSEEINAPERQUE
Giancarlo Bolognesi
1. J'avais tout d'abord pense de parler, dans ce Symposium "When Worlds Collide", de 1'impact du grec et de l'iranien sur l'armenien prelitteraire, mais je me suis enfin decide a trailer une question que je consid&re prealable, c'est-h-dire le probleme de la place que l'arme'nien occupe dans Tensemble des langues indo-europeennes, eu egard surtout aux solutions qu'on a donrie a ce probleme au cours des siecles. П est bon de remarquer a ce propos que dans l'histoire de la linguistique armenienne la question la plus importante et la plus difficile a resoudre ne fut pas celle de reconnaitre le caract&re indo-europeen de la langue, mais celle de preciser les repports prehistoriques de l'armenien avec les autres langues indo-europeennes.
En effet, dans son ouvrage Ueber die Sprache und Weisheit der Iridier qui comme on a dit - " appartient encore a la prehistoire de la linguistique ", Friedrich Schlegel avait, deja avant Franz Bopp, bien clairement releve des affinites lexicales entre l'armenien et plusieurs autres langues (a savoir l'indien, l'iranien, le grec, le latin, les langues germaniques et les langues slaves), parmi lesquelles on peut mentionner:
arm. k'an lat. quam
arm. m i "eins" gr. pCa
arm. hing lat. quinque
arm. m i 'die negative Partikel'
gr. РП
arm. an- gr.d- all. un
arm. lowsaworem iat. luceo
arm. lowcem gr. Айш
arm. owranam gr- a p v eo p a u



228 When Worlds Collide
arm. amowm
arm. dnem
arm. atem
arm. owtem
arm. Inowm
arm. tarn
arm. em
arm. berem
"und viele andre".
gr. a p v u p a t
gr. d e t v a t
lat. odium
lat. edo
lat. plenus
lat. do
angl. I am
lat. fero, persan
burdan
Il convient encore de remarquer que Friedrich Schlegel avait deja exactement releve des affinites non seulement lexicales, mais aussi - ce qui importe le plus morphologiques entre Гarmenien et d'autres langues; en effet il dit explicitement: "Wichtiger noch aber sind die Uebereinstimmungen in der Struktur; zum Beispiel luanam - lavo, luanas - lavas, luanan - lavan t... Einige Participia in al stimmen dagegen mehr mit den slavischen Sprachen ueberein" (1). Mais apres Friedrich Schlegel les linguistes ont echoue' sur la question cruciale de definir la position dialectale de l'armenien. Tout le monde sait bien comment les choses se sont passees. Encore en 1857, dans la preface de la seconde edition de sa Vergleichende Grammatik, Franz Bopp soutenait: "das Armenische gehort dem iranischen Zweige unserer Sprachfamilie an" (2). A ce propos je pense qu'il vaut la peine de reprendre et de developper une recherche precedente (3), pour attirer l'attentiom sur une theorie linguistique passee inapercue, dans le but de faire ainsi justice d'un lieu commun bien enracine et repandu. Concernant le probleme des rapports entre l'armenien et les autres langues indoeuropeennes, et tout spdcialement entre l'armenien et l'iranien, on continue encore a dire, et on lit encore d'ordinaire dans les traites, dans les manuels meme les plus influents et dans les articles des savants meme les plus renommes, que les premiers orientalistes, linguistes et comparatistes avaient ete trompes aux siecles precedents par la grande quantity des emprunts a l'iranien, et qu'ils avaient par consequent considere' l'armenien comme un dialecte iranien, et que ce ne fut qu'en 1875 que Hiibschmann retablit, par son "epochemachender Beitrag" (4), la veritable perspective dialectale en demontrant l'autonomie originale de l'armenien, qui constitue done un "selbstandiger sprachzweig" de la famille linguistique indo-europeenne. Cette opinion commune, selon laquelle la reconnaissance de l'armenien comme independant de l'iranien serait une decouverte de la seconde moitie du XIXе siecle, se revele indubitablement fausse a la lumiere d'irrefutables documents



Bolognesi 229
historiques qu'on a laisses de cote avec desinvolture ou qu'on n'a pas lus avec une attention suffisante.
2. Le fait est que des le debut du XVIIIе siecle l'orientaliste allemand Johann Joachim Schroder, dans son Aramean lezowin ganj.Hoc est: Thesaurus linguae Armenicae, antiquae et hodiemae ..., avait clairement et exactement considere l'armenien comme une langue autonome et independante de l'iranien, comme une langue qui a sa propre individuality consistant "ex vocibus ejus propriis", a laquelle furent seulement ensuite ajoutes et/ou superposes pas mal de mots issus de l'iranien, et d'autres langues aussi. Sur les causes historiques qui ont determine l'introduction en armenien de mots etrangers, surtout iraniens, Schroder e'crit:
" Cum autem, teste Chorenensi (sal. Moyse) nostro, variis aetatibus variae Armeniam ingressae sint illustres familiae, ipsa quoque Haicana natio bella cum vicinis & e longinquo irruentibus populis gravissima gesserit, nec non commercia cum alienigenis coluerit; nequaquam dubitandum, quin tot seculorum lapsu peregrina quaedam vocabula in Haicanam Linguam irrepserint, quae ex frequenti usu postmodum Armenica facta, ab Auctoribus Armenis etiam optimis adhibita, adhuc Libros eorum inspicienti occurrant, uti Capite sequenti monstrabimus” (5).
Et parmi les "illustres familiae . . . quae diversis seculis in Armeniam venerunt", auxquelles on doit la penetration en armenien de mots etrangers (peregrina quaedam vocabula), Schroder mentionne explicitement les Arsakownik'ou "Arsacidae", c’est-adire les Arsacides (6). Et de fait, au chapitre suivant (Capite sequenti), Schroder se refere explicitement au discours amorce auparavant:
"Sed quoniam, uti ex Moyse Chorenensi ostendimus, variae nationes Armeniam ingressae, & exteri bello earn aggressi sunt, quos vocabula aliqua in Haicana lingua reliquisse monuimus, hinc non sine jucunditate eorum vestigia legemus"(7).
Parmi les traces, les vestiges (vestigia) que les autres peuples (variae nationes) et les etrangers (exteri) ont laisses dans la langue armenienne (quos vocabula aliqua in Haicana lingua reliquisse monuimus) Schroder indique surtout les mots d'origine iranienne. C'est precisement en cela que resident la nouveaute et le grand merite de Schroder, d'avoir bien compris plus d'un siecle et demi avant Hubschmann qu'en armenien les iranismes etaient tout simplement des emprunts, et non des termes originaux. C'est ce qui ressort incontestablement du Thesaurus de Schroder ou on lit:
Antiqua Parthica abArsacidis in Armeniam introducta vocabula... sunt (8).



230 When Worlds Collide
Il est bon de remarquer que Schroder ne parle pas generiquement de mots iraniens introduits en armenien, mais qu'il indique avec une grande precision la langue iranienne d'ou l'armenien a tire ses emprunts, et meme l’epoque historique des emprunts. Il s'agit d'emprunts "parthes", c'est-a-dire issus de 1'aire dialectale moyen-iranienne du NordOuest, et de la periode arsacide; ces deux delimitations, spatiale et chronolgique, ont ete bien appuyees et confirmees, comme chacun sait, par les recentes etudes linguistiques iraniennes qui ont demontre par des preuves indiscutables qu'effectivement la plus grande partie des emprunts iraniens est d'origine parthe et date de la periode ou la branche cadette de la dynastie arsacide gerait le pays d'Armenie. L’indication de I’origine parthe des emprunts armeniens est d'autant plus interessante qu'au temps oil Schroder ecrivait ( 1711) on ne connaissait encore aucun document de la langue parthe. П vaut la peine de rappeler qu'exactement deux siecles apres Schroder, en 1911, Meillet s'exprimait en des termes semblables quand il parlait des
" emprimts de l'armenien a l'iranien de l'epoque arsacide, a la langue des Parthes"( 9 ).
C'est une ressemblance, meme formelle, vraiment frappante, entre deux textes a deux siecles de distance. Remarquons encore que Schroder a exactement releve que ces emprunts a la langue parthe sont en armenien des mots d'un emploi courant ( ex frequenti usu ), et egalement des mots bien employes par les meilleurs auteurs classiques ( ab Auctoribus Armenis etiam optimis adhibita ).
Parmi les mots armeniens, dont Schroder a reconnu avec finesse l'origine iranienne en s'appuyant sur le rapprochement du persan, il suffit de mentionner:
arm. angam "v ice" persan hangam
arm. baxt"fortuna" persan baxt
arm. brinj"oryza" persan birinj
arm. dahlic "vestibulum" persan dahliz, dihliz
arm. d o s t"planities persan dost
arm. dip a k"vestis serica" persan debah
arm. draxt "hortus * persan diraxt
arm. kowz "urceus" persan kHz-а



Bolognesi 231
arm. v a t"m alus" persan bad
arm. vatt'ar "pejus" persan badtar.
A propos de l'arm. dram " nummus, drachma, pondus" il est interessant de relever que Schroder avait deja bien compris que ce mot, d'une evidente origine grecque, penetra en armenien par l'intermediare de l'iranien ( 10 ).
3. La grande finesse d'esprit de Schroder ressort encore mieux du fait qu'il a exactement reconnu en armenien la presence non seulement de plusieurs emprunts iraniens, mais aussi d'emprunts syriaques, grecs, arabes qui, sous l'influence de " parastrats " et de " superstrats ”, ont enrichi remarquablement le fonds originel du vocabulaire armenien. Parmi les mots armeniens, que Schroder a exactement reconnus comme emprimts syriaques, on peut mentionner:
arm. dar ” seculum"
arm. t'argrnanel "interpretari"
arm. maids "vectigal"
arm. k'ahanay"sacerdos"
arm. k'aroz"praeco, concionator, & concio"
syr, dara
syr. targmana
syr. maxsa
syr. kahna
syr. karoza. (II).
4. Schroder a meme identifie et exactement indique dans le vocabulaire armenien la presence d'emprunts grecs:
Graeca ( scil. vocabula ) per bella, scientiarum stadium, & per Christianam religionem Armenis innotuemnt ( 12).
D'ou il ressort que Schroder a de fait egalement decouvert les deux causes principales de l'influence lexicale grecque sur l'armenien: le christianisme (per Christianam religionem) qui favorisa sans doute la penetration culturelle grecque en Armenie, et un vif interet pour la civilisation grecque qui porta a l'etude et a la traduction de textes non seulement des nerk'in owsmownk' ou " sciences interieures " ( ayant rapport a l'etude des Saintes Ecritures et aux dissertations theologiques ), mais aussi des artak'in owsmownk' ou " sciences exterieures ", a savoir la grammaire, la rhdtorique, la philosophic, 1'arithmetique et la geometrie, l'astronomie, la medecine, etc. ( <per> scientiarum studium ).



232 When Worlds Collide
En effet, Schroder a bien reconnu en armenien non seulement des emprunts grecs typiques de la terminologie religieuse chretienne, comme:
arm. episkopos gr. 'еиистионог
arm. kat'owlikos gr. ча% о\ъч б£
arm. kiraki gr. xuptotxn
arm. hefanos gr. e § v o s
arm. patriark' gr. itaTpbdtpxns
arm. saimos gr. (jjaXpos,
mais aussi bien d'autres emprimts grecs de la langue profane et la'ique, a savoir:
arm. brabion gr. g p a 3 e~bov
arm. klimay gr. иХьра
arm. hiwle gr. uAn
arm. moros gr. Mwpos
aim .pnak gr- ituva^
arm. tokos gr. t ^hos
ana.p'alang gr. сраХау?
5. Schroder a egalement compris que meme l'arabe a influence, bien que plus recemment, le vocabulaire armenien, et il a exactement reconnu, par exemple, que arm. m krat"forfex"est sans doute emprunte a l'arabe miqrad ( 14 ).6
6. D e toute facon Schroder ne s'est pas borne a identifier les emprunts iraniens, syriaques, grecs, arabes qui ont remarquablement enrichi le fonds originel du vocabulaire armenien, mais il a aussi indique clairement les mots qui constituent ce meme fonds lexical originel, c'est-a-dire les mots que l'armenien au cours de son histoire n'a pas empruntes a d'autres langues, mais qu'il a herite directement de l'indoeuropeen, comme on dirait en termes modernes. Schroder appelle ces mots armeniens originels voces ejus (scil. Haicanae Linguae ) propriae : ce sont les mots qui designent les realites primordiales et qui sont en effet les elements lexicaux les plus anciens de l'armenien, et en general de toutes les langues ( vocabula res naturales primum cognitas & in oculum incurrentes significantia, ceu omnium antiquissima (1 5 ).



Bolognesi 233
Par consequent les mots originels du vocabulaire armenien, selon Schroder, sont exactement ceux qui designent en particulier les parties du corps, les elements fondamentaux de la nature, les noms de parente tels que: a yr"vir", a c'k "oculi", atamn "dens ", a te l" odisse", g e t" fluvius ", etbayr" frater ", cow nr"genu ", kin "uxor ", hayr " pater ", howr "ignis ", jem " manus ", j i " equus ", jowkn "piscis ", mayr " mater ", mec " magnus ", m it " mens ", otn" pes ", jowr " aqua ", sirt " cor ", ter " dominus", town "dom us", k ’oyr ” soror ”, etc. Au fonds originel du vocabulaire armenien Schroder attribue encore les noms de nombre m i "unus ", erkow " duo ", erek'" tres ", c’ork'" quatuor ", king " quinque ", etc.; les trois series des demonstratifs ( et articles ) -s -d -n, sa da na, ays ayd ayn " hie,
iste, ille le pronom reflechi iwr " suus le pronom reciproque mimeans " invicem "
(16).
Et meme ces remarques concernant le fonds originel du vocabulaire агтёшеп se revelent fort correctes encore aujourd'hui. C'est en se fondant justement sur ces mots originels que Schroder proclame categoriquement l'autonomie et l'independance de la langue armenienne: "Haicana Lingua summo jure Cardinalis dicenda e s t "( 17 ). Le sens particulier que le terme Cardinalis a dans ce contexte, ressort bien d'un passage precedent qui explique:
" Cardinalem esse Haicanam Linguam probatur ex Vocibus ejus propriis " (18).
A Schroder revient done le grand merite d'avoir su distinguer dans le vocabulaire armenien son noyau originel et primitif des emprunts secondaires que les rapports historiques et culturels у ont ensuite introduits. C'est une question qui revet une grande importance, eu egard a l'epoque a laquelle Schroder vivait. Une opinion tout a fait differente l’emportait alors, e'est-^-dire que le vocabulaire armenien etait fondamentalement depourvu d'emprunts! Le jesuite francais Jacques Villotte, missionnaire en Armenie pendant 25 ans et auteur de plusieurs ouvrages en armenien, composa, trois ans apres le Thesaurus de Schroder, un Dictionarium novum Latino-Armenium qui a ete' т ё т е considere 11 le meilleur de tous ceux qui avaient ete publies auparavant " ( 19 ). Eh bien, dans la Dissertatio in linguam Armeniam qui precede son Dictionarium Villotte, apres avoir exalte la richesse et la variete du vocabulaire armenien, dit explicitement:
" Hoc deinde Haykanae linguae proprium est, & singulare, quod vocum copiam illam, de suo totam habet, nihil de alieno", tandis, qu’au contraire de l'armenien,
" Omnes fere Europae populos videmus, propriarum linguarum immensae molis Vocabularia texere; e quibus ea si detraxeris, quae a peregrinis linguis mutuata sunt, ingentem ilium acervum continuo videbis ruere, & in minimam molem redigi. Locupletem ilium minime dixerim, qui, quod habet, illud adsciscit aliunde"( 20 ).



Surle fond fence' de telles idees de ses contemporains, se de'tache encore davantage la theorie vraiment penetrante et innovatrice de Schroder, qui a bien su distinguer en armenien ce qui est emprunte de ce qui est originel. П ressort done de notre expose que Schroder parvint a esquisser, avec une clarte suffisante et une surprenante exactitude, l'histoire du vocabulaire armenien et sa stratification complexe. D e ce point de vue, meme a presque trois siecles de distance, l'ouvrage de Schroder presente les caracteres d'une frappante modernite et actualite. Je veux enfin relever un autre detail interessant: l'etonnante analogie entre l'ouvrage de Schroder et celui de Hiibschmann, non seulement sur le plan du contenu, mais aussi sur le plan de la forme. On sait que VArmenische Grammatik de Hiibschmann est structure en quatre sections fondamentales ( abstraction faite de la Section tres breve " Armenische Lehnworter unsicherer Herkunft " ), qui traitent respectivement des emprunts iraniens, des emprunts syriaques, des emprunts grecs et des mots armeniens indigenes. Eh bien, la disposition de la matiere est la meme dans le Thesaurus de Schroder, dont les paragraphes font parfaitement pendant aux grandes sections de l'ouvrage de Hiibschmann. A tout cela il faut encore ajouter le parfait parallelisme des titres memes chez Schroder et chez Hiibschmann:
234 When Worlds Collide
"vocabula Parthica"
"(vocabula) Chaldeo-Syriaca
" (vocabula) Graeca )"
range "voces
under "(vocabula
Persische Worter
Syrische Worter
Griechische Worter
range Echtarmenische
under Griechische Worter
"voces ejus ( scil. Haicanae Linguae ) propriae".
Une analogie si evidente doit vraiment faire reflechir. Ce que nous venons de dire donne davantage envie de savoir si Hiibschmann connaissait l'ouvrage de Schroder. La reponse a cette question est positive: en effet, Hiibschmann cite explidtement le Thesaurus linguae Armenicae , pourtant sans dire que son auteur avait deja clairement et exactement considere l'armenien comme une langue qui a sa propre individuality consistent" ex vocibus ejus propriis ", dans laquelle furent seulement ensuite introduits des emprunts secondaires iraniens, syriaques, grecs, arabes en consequence des rapports historiques avec d'autres traditions culturelles.
V oid tout ce que Hiibschmann s'est borne a dire de Schroder: "Einige richtige Etymologien hatte schon ( im J. 1711) Schrbder in seinem Thesaurus linguae Armenicae p. 45-47 gegeben"( 2 1 ).
Bien sur, Hiibschmann a eu la possibility de faire ce que Schroder ne pouvait pas faire, e'est-a-dire il a demontre scientifiquement, surtout par des preuves phonetiques, que



Bolognesi 235
l'armenien etait effectivement une langue autonome et independante de l'iranien, et cette demonstration lui aurait valu l'estime universelle et le titre de fondateur des etudes sdentifiques armeniennes, meme s'il avait reconnu la finesse d'esprit et l'e'tonnante intuition de son devancier. Nous pouvons, finalement, aboutir a la condusion qu'il est bon de ne pas negliger a priori la lecture de livres appartenant a la ' prehistoire ' de la linguistique, celle-ci pouvant nous reserver la belle surprise de decouvrir qu'en realite' des verites sdentifiques, considerees comme des acquisition recentes, ont depuis longtemps e'te enoncees.

AGRICULTURAL TRANSITION, "INDO-EUROPEAN ORIGINS" AND THE
SPREAD OF FARMING
Marek Zvelebil and Kamil V. Zvelebil
Indo-European origins and the spread o f IE languages to the West and
towards the East represent one of the greatest puzzles of prehistory, archaeology
and lin gu istics. In this contribution we examine the unconventional hypothesis
recently advanced by Colin Renfrew in his book Archaeology and Language. The
Puzzle o f I n d o -E ur o pe a n Origins (1987), evalu ate its validity from both the
archaeological and linguistic perspectives, and offer an alternative model with
significant modifications of Renfrew’s "language-farming hypothesis".
Renfrew’s book provoked reaction in both the popular press and in scientific
journals (Baldi 1988, M allory 1988, Ehret 1988, Sherratt 1988) including our own
view s expressed in the recent issue o f Antiquity (Z velebil and Z velebil 1988).
Renfrew’s new model also played a prominent part in the contributions to and the
discussions at the Bellagio conference. The present contribution is an elaborated
version o f our ea rlier paper on the subject (Z veleb il and Z velebil 1988),
incorporating some of the views raised at Bellagio and taking into the account the
current discussion generated by Renfrew’s book.
In the follow ing pages, we shall first offer a few critical remarks of general
nature concerning both the linguistic and archaeological aspects of Renfrew’s
hypothesis; then we shall address the issue of the hypothetical westward movement
of the IE speakers into Europe, this will be followed by a discussion of the spread
o f IE p eop les towards the East, to India; in conclusion, we shall suggest an
alternative model for the IE presence in India and Europe, and its possible ties
with the spread of agro-pastoral farmers.



238 When Worlds Collide
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
R e n fr ew ’s h yp oth esis appears rela tiv ely straightfow ard. Indo-European
languages have become widely distributed in Europe:
"If we look at the distribution of Indo-European languages of Europe when
we first see them in the centuries shortly before or after the beginning of the
Christian era (or, in the case of Grece, a thousand years earlier), virtually the
whole of Europe seems to have been Indo-European-speaking... This is a vast area
for such a degree of uniformity." (1987:145).
How can one explain such uniform distribution? After considering a number
of models which can account for dispersals of language, and after considering the
v ia b ility of the currently favoured explanation, that of the Indo-European
dispersal from the south Russian steppes in the 3rd millenium BC, Renfrew
concludes:
"In proposing a specific solution I found it difficult to accept the arguments
put foward for profound population and language changes across the whole of
Europe at the beginning of the bronze age, somewhere in the third millennium
B.C. The main objection to this solution was archaeological: that there does not
seem to be any sufficiently profound and widespread shift in the archaeological
record at that time to justify such a conclusion.
In surveying European prehistory I do not believe that we can see any one
process, nor any series o f processes at once sufficiently profound in social and
demographic consequences and so widespread geographically as to suggest a viable
background for such radical linguistic changes, until we go right back to the time
of the spread of farming."(1987: 265)
This passage encapsulates all the assumptions on which Renfrew’s hypothesis



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 239
can be questioned. Renfrew argues that farming was introduced to Europe from
Anatolia by immigrant farmers some 8000 years ago (6500 - 6000 BC), that these
farmers colonised most o f Europe through small-scale migration and occupation of
hitherto unfarmed areas over the generations; and that these farmers were the
original Indo-European speakers who introduced the language to Europe. He
further assumes that by the beginning o f the Classical period at the latest, and
perhaps as early as 3000 B.C. (by the time the farming colonisation of Europe was
com pleted), Indo-European languages were uniformly distributed over the
European continent, save for a few marginal areas such as the Basque country. A
final major assumption is that the spread of Indo-European languages in Europe
was a single event, and that archaeologically, only the spread of farming can
explain such geographically widespread phenomenon .
Suggestions that Indo-European origins extend back to the Stone Age in time
and/or to the general area o f the Near East in space have recently been made by
several authors (Clarke 1968, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984, Dolukhanov 1986c). In
the first com prehensive treatm ent of this hypothesis, Renfrew suggests
demographic and econom ic rationales for the process o f the Indo-European
dispersals. Transition from foraging to farming engenders an increase in food
production and population growth, which in turn fuel the need for the colonisation
of unfarmed habitats.
In this way Renfrew provides a socio-econom ic explanation for the diffusion
of farmers to Europe, and for the dispersal of Indo-European languages: a clear
advance on previous models.
There are, however, assumptions in Renfrew’s line of reasoning, which look
distinctly less convincing after a closer exam ination of the data ordered by
Renfrew’s clear presentation. At the most general level, there is the whole question
of a relationship between language, culture and population. Despite the warning
delivered by Renfrew (1987:75-77, see also this volume), the language-farming
hypothesis equates, in effect, the IE language group with people (the first farmers)
and further, with the archaeological cultures of the Neolithic. This comes at a time



240 When Worlds Collide
when the normative view of culture has finally been recognised as inadequate and
oversim plified in archaeology (Clarke 1968, Binford 1962, 1972, Shiffer 1972,
1976,) while in linguistics, already Edward Sapir warned in 1921 against equating
language, race and culture. The burden of proof, then, must fall on Renfrew, to
demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt, that in this case such normative view holds.
As we shall try to show, Renfrew falls short of this requirement.
When it comes to the hypothetical IE protolanguage, we should never forget
that Indo-European is a construct, not a demonstrable reality. As A. Meillet put it
in 1922, "on ne restitue pas par la comparaison une langue disparue... on ne restitue
done pas l’indo-europeen" (1964:41). We should always bear in mind that not a
single sentence, not a single work, not even a single sound of an Indo-European
tongue, before its differentiation and dispersal, has been preserved. This makes it
even more d ifficu lt to equate an archaeological culture - a construct in its own
right - with a hypothetical Indo-European speaking people.
M oreover, if there ever was a single Indo-European protolanguage, most
linguists are convinced that at that stage it must have been differentiated into
several dialects territorially, and perhaps even socioliguistically, since it was a
language spoken obviously without any centre of prestige, without any central
authority, and since the unifying and standardizing effect of literacy and all that
goes with it was to ta lly absent. Thus, when speaking of the spread of
Indo-European, one should rather speak of the spread of Indo-European dialects
than about the spread of a single homogenous Indo-European speech.
WESTERN MOVEMENTS
R enfrew ’s model for the westward spread of the Indo-European speaking
farmers from their original homeland in Anatolia is based on two key assumptions,
which we now wish to question: the notion of a widespread distribution of
Indo-European languages in neolithic Europe, and that of Indo-European dispersals
as a single, continuous process. To address the first assumption, our reconstruction



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 241
of the possible distribution o f identified non-Indo-European languages (figure 1)
shows that virtually the whole of the Iberian peninsula, the whole of Italy,
Mediterranean islands, southern France, large parts of the Atlantic coast and large
parts of Britain were probably non-Indo-European during most of the prehistoric
period. There are at least six identifiable non-Indo-European speeches known to
us (Etruscan, Basque, Ligurian, Iberian, Tartessian, Pictish), plus fiv e possible
n on -In d o-E u rop ean tongues (S icel, R haetic, M essapic, East Italic,
pre-Indo-European Illyrian) (Pulgram 1978, 1958, Jackson 1955, Krahe 1936,
M eillet 1964, Stevenson 1983). Hydronyms and other topographic items as well as
a number of common words ind icate the presence of these, and other
non-Indo-European languages which have left no trace, in many parts of Europe,
later covered by Indo-European. As a few more or less randon samples we may
quote from Occitan (southern France) cf.clap stone<*clapp-, garric var. of
oak < *garr-/*carr-, serra m ountain-crest<serr-, true hillock; summit, sue
mountain-summit<*cuc-; (Alibert 1977), and from Slavonic cf. les wood, forest;
krosna pannier, kuna marten, kolpik var of wading bird, ald’bji/lad’ji (czech lod)
ship, vessel. Hence it would seem that Indo-European languages were far more
restricted than historical sources would suggest. It may well have been the case
that non-Indo-European languages were spoken in large territories, particularly in
areas outside the European continental core; and that the initial agricultural
colonisation did not reach these areas.
These observations do not necessarily negate Renfrew’s model, but they can
be accommodated within its framework only if we allow for two distinct areas in
the dynamism o f a gradual, intermittent spread of Indo-European dialects: one, the
area o f "primary dispersal" another, the area of "secondary dispersal". Within the
area of primary dispersal - south-east and central Europe - Indo-European
languages may have been adopted relatively rapidly and on a more massive scale;
within the secondary areas - Eastern and Northern Europe, Italy, Iberia, southern
and central France, Atlantic coast, British Isles - the dialects of Indo-European
were adopted at a later date through cultural diffusion, sm all-scale population
sh ifts and elite dominance. The primary dispersal may have w ell involved
colon isation in the way envisaged by Renfrew, in the secondary areas, the



242 When Worlds Collide
indigenous pre-Indo-European populations must have played an important role in
the process of Indo-Europeanisation.
Ehret (1988) noted different ways in which Indo-European languages may
have been adopted by the indigenous populations through contact, trade and elite
dominance. We have a recent sm all-scale model of such developments, historically
attested, in the N ilgiri H ills area of Southern India before the time of British
colonisation. This analogy shows how the Badaga language (originally a dialect of
Kannada spoken by refugees from Karnataka) spread in the 16th and subsequent
centuries throughout the N ilg iri area. Thanks to their more com plex and
productive socio-econom ic structures (advanced agriculture, market-oriented food
production) the Badagas became the dominant people, and their language was
adopted as the lingua franca among some sixteen tribal groups, whose languages
were fully or partly mutually unintelligible. Badaga is today totally dominant in
the areas of their primary colonisation - fertile v a lley s- and the tongue of
common intercourse in the areas originally inhabited by the indigenous tribes
which have now become the territory of peripheral, secondary Badaga colonisation.
The tribal languages are on the decline, while Badaga speakers grow in number,
from som e 500 in 1603 to 120 000 today, partly a result o f acculturation of
indigenous groups (Hockings 1980, K.V. Zvelebil 1980, 1981, Emeneau n.d.).
During the agricultural transition in the Neolithic, the situation was certainly
d iffer en t. As D ennell pointed out (D ennell 1985), social, technological and
econom ic differences between hunter-gatherer and neolithic farming societies were
bound to be much smaller than among any recent ethnographic examples, reducing
the socio-econom ic and demographic advantages which the farmers might possess
(see also below ). But we think the N ilgiri analogy is valid in so far as it
underlines the possibility of an Indo-European lingua franca being adopted from a
small group of agricultural colonists by the indigenous hunting and gathering
population.
The second major assumption in Renfrew’s model goes to the heart of the



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 243
matter. This is whether the Indo-European dispersals were a single process, caused
by a single factor - the agricultural transition, and fuelled by a single mechanism
- the farmer colonisation. We have tried to show that linguistic paleogeography of
Europe does not support this view. We think that archaeological evidence as well
casts serious doubt on the suitability of Renfrew’s model in most parts of Europe.
W hile the introduction o f agro-pastoral farming to south-east Europe around
6500 BC and its subsequent spread to the rest of Europe can hardly be doubted,
profound d ifferences exist about the rate, the direction and method of its
dispersal. Are w e talking about an indigenous development of farming in Europe
based on local and imported cultigens and domesticates (Dennell 1983, Barker
1985), a farmer colonisation involving sm all-scale migrations (Ammermann and
C avalli-Sforza 1984), or a mixture of the two processes (Zvelebil,M 1986a)? This
question concerns the contribution of the local, possibly non-IE m esolithic
populations in the subsequent cultural development of Europe. If the farming
econom ies were developed locally, the genetic contribution of intrusive populations
was negligible, and Renfrew’s hypothesis, in its present form, does not hold. If, on
the other hand, farmer immigration from Anatolia was primarily responsible for
the introduction of farming to Europe, the language-farming hypothesis cannot be
excluded. In the interm ediate case, language farming hypothesis may apply in
certain parts of Europe, but would not account for the uniform distribution of IE
languages one can see in Europe today.
Renfrew opts for the Ammermann-Cavalli-Sforza’s "Wave of Advance" model
o f dem ic diffu sion of farm ing into Europe, which best suits his case (1987:
124-133). From the archaeological perspective, however, this model has serious
shortcomings (Z velebil,M . 1986a, 1986b), and Renfrew, although he ackowledges
some o f the problems involved (1987: 149, 151, 266, 268,), is nevertheless tempted
to equate the introduction of farming with diffusion of new people regardless of
the regional context (1987:148-149,159-161,190, 242,). In our view, the "Wave of
Advance" model, based on demic diffusion of farming does not apply in most
areas of Europe on following grounds.



244 When Worlds Collide
Mesolithic-Neolithic continuity.
In most areas of Europe there is no archaeological evidence of immigration or
colon isation by new people of areas hitherto occupied by indigenous
hunter-gatherers. Migrations are notoriously difficult to identify in archaeological
contexts, but most people would not rule out the possibility of immigration
occurring where there is a radical break in settlement pattern, material culture,
and ideology compared to the previous culture of an area. With the possible
exception of the LBK culture in Central Europe, and some areas of south-east
Europe, this is not the case at the M esolithic-Neolithic transition. On the contrary,
in most areas, there is continuity of settlement, continuity of some aspects of
material culture (such as lithics) and retention of symbols (bear, waterbirds, fish)
across the m esolithic-neolithic transition (Dennell 1983, Zvelebil 1986a, etc ). It
would seem that in most parts o f Europe, agro-pastoral farming was added to the
existing patterns of resource use by the indigenous populations (generating,
naturally, som e changes in the material culture), rather than being the "fossil
directeur" of immigrant farmer colonisation.
Evidence from physical anthropology.
According to the traditional diffusionist view, the farmer colonisation of
Europe can be also d etected by the presence o f new physical traits in the
European populations, particularly the "round-headed" groups who progressively
replaced the indigenous "long-headed" types. This argument has been recently used
by V end , for example (1986). However, the use of the cephalic index to distinguish
between round and long-headedness has been criticised on methodological grounds
(i.e. Gould 1981), while it remains to be seen to what extent the changes in the
shape of the face and the cranium are due to environmental (including nutritional)
as opposed to genetic factors (y’Edynak 1978, Gould 1981 ). As Gould reminded us
(Gould 1981), already in 1912 Franz Boas established that significant changes in



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 245
the shape of the cranium can develop among immigrants to the United States in
the course of a few generations. If such changes can occur as a result of dietary
changes (Boas 1912, y’Edynak 1978), the cranial differences among European
N eolithic population could reflect the shift from hunting-gathering to farming,
rather than the arrival of genetically distinct populations.
More recently, Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza (1984) have employed blood
group and other genetic differences within European populations to support their
hypothesis of a farmer colonisation. As one of us has argued elsewhere,
distribution patterns arising from these differences could result from other,
h isto rica lly docum ented m igrations in Europe, and not n ecessarily from the
neolithic farmer colonisation (Zvelebil, M. 1986b). A latest extensive study of
genetic variability among modern populations of Europe and of its relationship to
language fam ilies by Sokal et.al. (1989) shows just how complex the problem is,
and, if anything argues for genetic differentiation resulting from several sources.
A lthough, w isely , R enfrew does not em brace these arguments, they form an
integral part o f the justification for the "Wave of Advance" model (Ammermann
and C avalli-Sforza 1984), and as such had to be treated here at some length. Our
conclusion is that on the present evidence, physical anthropology or genetic
patterning do not lend support to the colonisation model of the transition to
farming in Europe.
Rate of transition to farming economies.
D esp ite R enfrew ’s assertion to the contrary (1987:190), the adoption of
farming in Europe was a slow process, which took at least 3000 years to complete
and p robably much longer. In som e areas o f E urope, such as peninsular
Scandinavia or the temperate zone of eastern Europe, farming was not adopted
until the 2nd. M illenium B.C., some 4000-5000 years after its introduction in
Greece. The transition to farming was in fact slower than could be expected under
the "Wave of Advance" model (Zvelebil,M. 1986a).



246 When Worlds Collide
Further evidence supporting our case for o f a complex nature of agricultural
transition in Europe, in which the indigenous groups played a significant part,
arises from a paper given at this (Bellagio) conference by Dr. Zohary. Zohary
traced the spread of the neolithic Near Eastern crop assemblage to Europe, West
Asia and the N ile Valley. If this is compared to the spread of domestic animals,
we can see that in some parts o f Europe the two events are not contemporary. In
parts of Italy, France, in the Iberian peninsula, and generally along the Atlantic
seabord o f Europe, domesticates were adopted earlier than cultigens. The same is
in fact true for the vast areas of Eastern Europe where domesticates often appear
a thousand years or more before the first evidence for cultigens. On the present
evidence, this may mean that agro-pastoral farming was not introduced as a
uniform package to Europe as a whole, merely to its central and south-eastern
parts. Some o f the delay and variation in the pattern o f the spread of farming in
Europe can be explained by the local ecological factors and by the colonisation of
secondary habitats. But above these local situations a broader pattern is emerging:
w h ile in sou th -eastern and central Europe farm ing already appears as a
w ell-d eveloped package, in the west, north and east it is adopted selectively, with
domesticates often preceeding cultigens. These areas correspond to the "culturally
indigenous Europe" where the continuity in material culture between the local
hunting-gathering and the first farming societies is apparent. We suggest,
therefore, that in these areas, local groups selected from the agro-pastoral package
those elements which fit their existing economies and social organisation, while
ignoring others. The selective, rather than inclusive adoption of farming in such
areas would then argue in favour o f demographic and cultural continuity from the
m esolithic into the neolithic, and against the colonisation of these areas by
immigrant farmers.
Our understanding of the spread of farming economy, and its contribution to
the overall diet, is prejudiced by the biases which operate against the preservation
and recovery o f wild faunal remains on archaeological sites dating to the period



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 247
o f agricultural transition. Wild animals are often butchered away from the main
settlements: they often rank among smaller species whose bones do not preserve as
w ell as those o f main domesticates, and moreover, other wild resources consist of
fish , water fow l and w ild plants, all of which stand much smaller chance of
preservation than products o f farming. In a recent publication G reenfield, for
instance, noted differential recovery techniques at Balkan neolithic sites, which
discrim inated against the retrieval o f wild faunal samples (Greenfield 1986).
Bearing these points in mind, it may well be the case that the contribution of
hunting and gathering in transitional farming-foraging communities has been
routinely underestimated, and that the transition to farming has been a much more
gradual process than hitherto acknowledged.
DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS:
Renfrew adopts Ammermann and Cavalli-Sforza’s demographic argument that
far greater population growth among immigrant neolithic farmers was bound to
displace or absorb the indigenous hunter-gatherer populations, or make their role
otherwise insignificant (1987: 124-131, 147, 150, etc.) In this way even a small
initial population of farmers, moving into a new niche could rapidly become a
decisive cultural and demographic force within a region. While it is undeniably
true that the potential for population growth is far greater among farmers than
hunter-gatherers, it cannot be autom atically assumed such potential had a
profound impact in the N eolithic. As Dennell argued (1985), neolithic farmers
faced many social technological and environmental handicaps in Europe, which
might have reduced their reproduction capability. Palaeopathology of neolithic
populations, especially in western Europe, shows that their health status was no
better and probably worse than that of the mesolithic populations (Cohen and
Armelagos 1984). On the other hand, the viability and population density of the
indigenous hunter-gatherers in Europe seems to have been underestimated by both,
Ammermann and C avalli-Sforza (1984) and Renfrew (1987:130). We suggest,
therefore, that the demographic differences between the neolithic farmers and
mesolithic indigens, were not, in general, as great as Renfrew maintains.



248 When Worlds Collide
A second serious problem with this view arises from the dichotomy itself.
First, if the indigenous hunter-gatherers adopted farming as we suggest was the
case in most areas of Europe, then their demographic potential would approach the
level o f the neolithic agro-pastoral farmers. Second, if the colonising farmers
(whether immigrant or indigenous) used wild resources to a greater extent than
hitherto recognised (as we argue above), then we are effectively talking about
mixed foraging-farm ing econom ies in both cases and the productivity levels on
either side o f the agricultual frontier should not have been that far apart. The
d ifference in reproductive potential, therefore, could not have been so great,
although some difference probably did exist. This argument serves to reinforce the
view that where M esolith ic-N eolith ic transition is concerned the agricultural
frontier is a construct as artificial and inappropriate as the Berlin Wall. Instead of
a line, it can best be regarded as a broad transitional zone where the process of
replacement o f foraging by farming is going on. To what extent this process is
accomplished by the adoption of farming among local population, and to what
extent by the secondary colonisation from earlier farming centres , is regionally
variable and, for many regions, still unresolved (Zvelebil,M. 1986a).
In summary then, the "wave o f advance" agricultural colonisation of Europe
remains an unprobable hypothesis for most parts of the continent. The possible
exceptions are certain areas of south-east and central Europe, where a radical
break in settlem ent pattern and cultural traditions are associated with the spread
of farming economy (figure 2). In view of this conclusion, one must question the
language-farm ing hypothesis of Indo-European origins as presented by Renfrew.
On a r c h a e o lo g ic a l grounds, first farm ers may or may not have been
Indo-European. Archaeologically, there are no compelling reasons to believe that
they were.
EASTERN MOVEMENTS
We wish to offer the following critical remarks on Renfrew’s treatment of the



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 249
spread of Indo-European towards the east, particularly to India. When discussing
the civilisation of the Indus V alley cities and the arrival of Indo-European
speakers in northwestern India, Renfrew apparently ignores the presence of
Dravidian in the whole of India including its northwest, north and northeast at a
date at least as early as the Rgvedic hymns. This Dravidian presence is not a
hypothesis but a fact attested by obvious loanwords in the Rgveda and in later
V edic texts, e.g., m ayura- peacock, phala- fruit, khala-threshing floor,
ulukhala-mortar for grinding, katuka-pungent, bitter; etc. T. Burrow (1945, 1946,
1948) finds twenty undisputed Dravidian loans in the early hymns of the Rgveda.
If the Rgvedic exam ples, or any of them, are accepted, this is the evidence for the
presence o f Dravidian speakers as far toward the northwest as the Punjab, i.e. the
upper Indus V alley, during the first centuries of the presence of Indo-European
speakers in India. It is not a clear evidence for the Dravidian nature of the
Harappan civilisation or language (or one of the Harappan languages) but it does
lead toward that hypothesis. Additional support is lent to this hypothesis by the
ex isten ce o f isolated Dravidian "pockets" (Brahui, Kurux, M alto, Dhangar in
Nepal) far in the northwest and northeast of the subcontinent even today.
Renfrew appears to favour Indo-European origins of the civilisation of the
Indus V alley cities, and refers to several scholars who failed to decipher Harappan
as Dravidian, ignoring, unfortunatelly, the more serious and convincing attempts
(Mahadevan 1977, 1980, Fairservis 1983). However, the attempts to "read" Harappan
as an early form of Indo-European have proved to be a total failure (a typical
case being that of B. Hrozny, 1943), and are not even taken seriously today.
Although nothing has been proved so far, there is a number of sound reasons to
tentatively regard Harappan script/language as Dravidian since certain features
revealed by positional statistics and structural patterns of the Indus script/language
show convincingly that it is not related to Indo-European, since many cultural
features appear to be com pletely indigenous to India, and since the most probable
candidate appears to be Dravidian (K.V. Zvelebil 1985b).
In our view , the Rgvedic Aryas presumably lived in Upper Punjab, roughly to
the north and northeast o f the Harappan territory proper, while the most



250 When Worlds Collide
important sites o f the Harappan civilisation were situated along the Indus, roughly
to the south of Upper Punjab, as w ell as to the east and south-east of the river.
Thus the northern fringes of the Harappan territory bordered on the southern
fringes o f the Rgvedic Indo-European areas, and that is where presumably the
contacts, the clashes, even the battles between the Indo-European Aryas and the
Dasyus (Dravidians?) might indeed have taken place, although Renfrew does not
give credence to such view and prefers to regard the Dasyus/Dasas as demons,
ghosts and other evil supernatural beings (1987:182 ff). However, the references to
the Dasas in the Aryan texts, to their forts and the battles with them are
com pletely realistic: they are described as dark-skinned, bull-lipped, snub-nosed
or "noseless" w orshippers of the phallus, and of hostile speech which was
unintelligible. In short, this fits very well with the image the Aryas must have had
of the Dravidian (?) speaking "barbaroi" - the Harappans.
We do not have to posit a wholesale destruction of the Harappan civilisation
by Indo-European Aryas; in this point we certainly agree with Renfrew. There
apparently were com plex causes o f its decline, a type of system-collapse, with the
invasions o f Aryan bands as one of the catalysts of that process. Chronologically it
fits well: battles between Dasyus and Aryas date to 2000-1800 BC, composition of
Rgvedie hymns to 1600-1200 BC.
AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL
Most of our critical comment, especially where the westward spread of
Indo-European is concerned, has been directed at the wave of advance model of
agricultural transition (Ammermann and Cavalli-Sforza 1984), rather than at the
la n g u a g e -fa r m in g h y p o th esis itse lf. In trying to locate the so cio -eco n o m ic
underpinnings of the Indo-European dispersal, Renfrew has over-emphasised the
application of the wave of advance model to the prehistoric situation in Europe. In
this context, Ehret’s cautious remark is appropriate:



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 251
"The previou s com m unities do not disappear, but becom e the m ajority
demographic component in the new ethnicity. The critical point is that language
and ethnic shift can take place without radical change in the material particulars
o f life and with an amount of change in the human gene pool so small as to be
for all purposes undetectable" (Ehret 1988:571).
Although Renfrew considered alternative means of language dispersal to
dem ic d iffu sio n , (systems collapse, elite dominance, "pidgin", etc) he does not
integrate them in his model (1987, this volume). Ehret considers other situations of
language dispersal which may apply to the Indo-European case (1988), while
Dolukhanov (1986c), Sherratt and Sherratt (1988) and Zvelebil and Zvelebil (1988)
have developed alternative models for the dispersal of Indo-European language
which try to combine socio-econom ic change at the agricultural transition with
other pertinent forms of language dispersal.
In our view , an elaboration of Renfrew’s language-farming hypothesis which
does not require widespread colonisation of Europe by initial farming populations
would be more convincingly supported by the archaeological data. This alternative
m odel, based on the sam e h ypoth esis, m akes the assum ptions that (1)
Indo-European language dispersals were not a uniform and continuous process, but
a punctuated, m ulti-stage and repetitive one, (2) that no widespread population
displacements took place in most o f Europe during the agricultural transition, and
that (3) the Indo-European languages spread at different times and due to
different causes, resulting in the distributional palimpsest we are seeing today.
Our model envisages three stages of dispersal in Europe: (figure 2):
(1) Introduction o f agro-pastoral farming to Europe from the Near East via
Anatolia, 6500 - 5000 BC (6000 - 4500 be).
This is basically the same as the model proposed by Renfrew for the whole of
Europe; here, however, we restrict the geographical scope to those areas where
ag/ricultural colonisation can be actually postulated: the LBK province in Central



252 When Worlds Collide
Europe, the Tripolye culture in the Ukraine, the area of the early Balkan
N eolithic and some areas o f southern Italy. Language dispersal during this stage
would take place due to the same socio-econom ic causes as those advanced by
Renfrew in his language-farm ing hypothesis. In departure from Renfrew’s views,
however, we view this as an exceptional situation.
(2) Consolidation o f farming and "Secondary products revolution" 4800-2500
BC (4000-2000 b.c.)
This period encompasses the middle and late Neolithic in Europe. The period
is geographically diachronic, occurring earlier in southern parts of Europe than in
the north. Although their timing and contemporaniety are a matter of debate
(Sherratt 1981,1983, Barker 1985, Bogucki 1987, Greenfield 1988, Chapman 1988), the
significant developments during this period are the development of agriculture in
sub-optim al and marginal habitats and agricultural intensification brought about
by the developm ent of diary farm ing, ard plough, animal traction and other
aspects of the secondary products revolution (Sherratt 1981).
When regarded at a pan-European scale, only a very broad picture can
em erge. But this is the tim e when agro-pastoral farming was adopted in the
"secondary dispersal" areas, referred to earlier. Many of these areas show cultural
continuity with the mesolithic hunter-gatherer culture. At a regional scale, farming
extends from the best lowland soils into sub-optimal upland areas, some of which
have hitherto been occupied by hunting and gathering communities (Barker 1985,
Zvelebil 1986a, Bogucki 1987, etc).
We propose that within this framework of secondary dispersals and regional
in -fillin g , two processes aided the diffusion of IE languages from central and
south-eastern Europe: adoption of farming by indigenous mesolithic populations
and the adoption of Indo-European as a language of exchange, new technology
and inter-grou p com m unication by non-IE speakers in western, northern and
eastern Europe, who were settled in zones then transitional to farming.



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 253
The second suggestion needs perhaps some elaboration. The great
fragmentation and sm all-scale diversity of languages among hunter-gatherer
societies is w ell documented. On the assumption that a similar situation existed
among the prehistoric hunter-gatherers in Europe, the existence of "lingua franca"
for inter-tribal communication would have been of advantage. More often than
not, such languages derive from the context outside the societies indigenous to the
area (eg. the Badaga example, Ehret 1988). The status of IE as a common language
of communication would be further enhanced if innovative technological and
econom ic practices were associated with it - as may have been the case if the first
farmers o f south-east and central Europe were Indo-European. In time, over many
generations, IE would come to replace the original language of the indigenous
inhabitants as their mother tongue.
In a recent paper in Antiquity, Ehret argued that "the overall implications of
glottochronology (are) that Indo-European divergence and spread was a process
b eginning, at the earliest, roughly in the range o f the second half o f the 5th
millennium BC, give or take several centuries, and that the early stages of the
process continued through the 4th and perhaps 3rd millennia" (1988:572). Without
wishing to get involved in the debate surrounding the value of glottochronology
(e.g., Renfrew, 1987 and his volume), it is worth noting that this view is in accord
with our m odel, if the initial spread of proto-Indo-European into Europe during
the earlier phase (6000-4500 BC) can be regarded as one of a closely related
group of dialects before divergence actually began (see also Sherratt and Sherratt
1988 for alternative explanation).3
(3) Elite dominance stage, 3800-ca.l000 BC (3000-1000 b.c.)
Renfrew considers this model and does not find it applicable to the European
situation prior to the 1st millennium B.C. (1987:163, but see Sherratt 1981, Sherratt
and Sherratt 1988). This is in keeping with his rejection of the Gimbutas’ "Kurgan"
theory (Gimbutas 1970), envisaging the spread of Indo-European languages with
nom adic pastoralists from the south Russian steppes. At one point, in fact,



254 When Worlds Collide
Renfrew suggests that nomadic pastoralism diffused eastwards from an early
centre of cultivation in western Ukraine. (1987:208 ,271 ).There is, however, recent
new evidence for the domestication o f the horse as early as 6000 BC (Matyushin
1986, Telegin 1986) in the area of south Urals. If this admittedly circumstantial
evidence w ill be borne out by further discoveries, the north central Asian and east
European steppes, about which very little is known at present, may yet emerge as
the original centers of horse dom estication and the development of pastoral
economies associated with it.
The area between the Dnieper and the Urals, the northern shores of the Black and
Caspian Seas, may have been an early and active centre of Indo-European
speaking com m unities. The early development of the pastoral economy would
provide an econom ic rationale for dispersal, especially within the context of
Eastern Europe (Sherratt 1981, Sherratt and Sherratt 1988, Anthony 1986, Telegin
1986, D olukhanov 1986a) and Central Asia (Zvelebil,M . 1980, Matyushin 1986,
Dolukhanov 1986b). There is nothing which would deny such nomadic pastoralist
access to sedentary agriculturists, so necessary for their survival (cf. Renfrew 1987:
197-205). On the contrary, nomadic pastoralists often assume the role of social
elite in such situations (Irons and Dyson-Hudson 1972, Dahl and Hjort 1976,
Khazanov 1984) We suggest that this may have provided a third mode of dispersal
of Indo-European languages, especially in marginal zones of Eastern Europe and
Central Asia, where the transition to agro-pastoral farming occured late (i.e. 2nd
millennium, and therefore would not be covered by stage 2), or did not occur at
all, hunting-gathering being directly replaced by nomadic pastoralism. Sherratt and
Sherratt (1988) have come to similar conclusions.
L ater population sh ifts had, of course, an e ffe c t on the distribution of
Indo-European languages. These include the events around 1000 BC and again
during the Migration Period, both of which Renfrew subsumes under his system
collapse model. They also include the tenure of the Roman Empire, responsible for
the diffusion of Romance languages. These repeated demographic and liguistic
changes reveal the m ulti-stage nature of linguistic dispersals. They also suggest
that the present picture is radically different from that prevalent in antiquity, and



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 255
that the initial area of Indo-European settlement in Europe may have been quite
small.
(4). The East
As far as the spread of Indo-European towards the east is concerned, we believe
we can accept the major premise that greater Anatolia was the key area where
early forms o f Indo-European might have been spoken even before 6000 BC. We
concur with Sheratt and Sheratt (1988) in regarding the larger Zagros area of
southern Iran and adjacent territories as one which also had non-Indo-European
p opu lation s: the Sum m erians, E lam ites, H atties and the (h ypothetic)
E lam o-D ravidians (M cA lpin 1981). The reconstruction o f an Elamo-Dravidian
linguistic entity may be, after the necessary modifications (K.V. Zvelebil 1985a),
accepted, and if so, we could posit a dispersal of Elamo-Dravidian languages to
the south and east of the Zagros mountains loop, towards India, where this
population established the Harappan civilisation, ethnically possibly rather
composite but with its elite speaking the Elamo-Dravidian language developing
there into proto-Dravidian (see also Sheratt and Sheratt 1988). From the Indus
valley area, proto-Dravidian extended in space to the west and northwest (witness
Brahui), northeast (Kurux, Malto, Dhangar) and to central and southern India
(today’s solid belt of Dravidian languages, both pre-literate and literate).
Thus it would seem that "greater" Anatolia was a tremendously "productive" area
with the successive populations of Summerians, Elamo-Dravidians, Elamites, Hattie
people and Indo-European Hittites. As Renfrew admits (albeit in what sounds like
an understatement), "not all the early farmers in the nuclear zone of domestication
spoke an early Indo-European language." Nagging questions remain, of course: Can
the development o f agro-pastoral farming in this area really account for such
demographic growth and ethno-linguistic diversity?
W hile the non-Indo-European, and possibly predominantly proto-Dravidian



256 When Worlds Collide
Harappan civilisation was still flourishing in the Indus valley and adjacent
territories, b efore and around 2000 B.C., the Indo-European speakers in the
steppes of southern Russia developed nomadic pastoralism . Subsequently,
Indo-E uropean speaking Aryas entered n orth -w est India in a series of raids
sometime after 2000 B.C., and struggled with the (Dravidian?) Harappans, a people
of d ifferen t civ ilisa tio n , d ifferen t ethnos, different culture and different
language(s). The non-Indo-European Harappan civilisation ended through complex,
processes which we do not quite understand, its script and language remaining to
date an undeciphered enigma; but one of the causes of its decline were the
invasions of Indo-European speaking Aryas ca. 2000 BC.
The result o f these processes in India was the Aryan "conquest" of much of the
peninsula in a typical situation of elite dominance over the Dasas or Dasyus,
between 2000 -1500 BC, although very strong residues of pre-Aryan languages and
cultures remained in the Indie linguistic, social and religious structures until today.
CONCLUSION
Renfrew speaks of a new solution of the Indo-European problem (1987:7). What
he has in fact done is to resuscitate an Indo-European Urvolk in an unexpected
Urheimat (Anatolia), pushed it back to seventh millennium BC, made them first
farm ers and proposed su ccessive displacem ents over the generations of
Indo-European peasant farmers who populated Europe and introduced one
undifferentiated Indo-European protolanguage. Presented like this, and particularly
with its consequences for the east (i.e. India, both Harappan and Vedic), we could
not accept it without strong reservations, although we admit its courageous
originality.
Presented with certain modifications, it becomes an attractive alternative model to
the traditional view of the spread of Indo-European languages by war-like
pastoral nomads from south Russian steppes much later, in the 3rd millennium BC.



Zvelebil & Zvelebil 257
What are the modifications we would propose?
(1) R enfrew ’s m odel is not a solution to the IE problem , but an alternative
hypothesis o f the emergence of IE languages in Europe and in Iran-India, provided
with a plausible socio-economic reasons for their initial spread East and West.
(2) W e can accept the region of "greater" Anatolia as one from which the IE
speaking farmers began their colonisation.
(3) The language they spoke was not one single homogenous IE protolanguage^but
a cluster of very closely related dialects of Indo-European.
(4) The spread occurred as a series of intermittent, successive moves of these
closely connected IE dialects, introduced by relatively small bands of farmers to
parts of south-east and central Europe.
(5) A great role was played in the subsequent development o f IE dialects by
non-IE languages spoken in various parts of Europe in quite large territories,
particularly in areas outside the European continental core. The initial agricultural
co lo n isa tio n p rob ably did not reach these areas. It is more lik e ly that
agro-pastoral farming, and IE languages were adopted in these areas towards the
end of the N eolith ic and during the Bronze Age through cultural diffusion,
sm all-scale population shifts and elite dominance along the lines suggested in our
alternative model. The indigenous population played a decisive role in these
later processes.6
(6) The spread of Indo-European towards the east, particularly in India: If at all
we have to posit, at an early date, a diffusion of people or languages from the
larger Anatolia/Iran region to the east, as w ell as a non-indigenous origin of the
Indus Valley C ivilisation, then we prefer the spread, between 4000-3000 BC, of
non-Indo-European agro-pastoralist farmers from the Anatolian-Iranian plateau
eastw ards to any other hypothesis (or, alternatively, local farming origins in
western India itself, under the ecologically favourable conditions prevalent in the



258 When Worlds Collide Indus valley); the origin and developm ent o f Harappan C ivilisation due to
non-Indo-European speakers, possibly the descendants of Elamo-Dravidians;
development of Indo-European nomadic pastoralism in the steppes of Russia and
the arrival o f Indo-European in India associated with the incursions of mounted
Aryan warriors about 2000-1800 BC; subsequent process of elite dominance and
linguistic Aryanisation of two thirds of the Indian peninsula.
If indeed local farming origins in western India are accepted rather than the
introduction by n on-in d igen ous immigrants of an agro-pastoralist farming
technology, our model does not at all require large-scale movements of people.
The hypothetic Elamo-Dravidian of the Harappan elite might have been imposed
on the local population by relatively small groups in successive waves just as,
alm ost 2000 years later, the Aryan of Indo-European mounted raiders was
successively and gradually imposed on the indigenous Dasyus population of India.
Just as in the case o f the western spread, one of the significant developments in
the Indus V alley area might have been the agricultural intensification caused by
the development of the plough (there is a striking linguistic evidence in favour of
this notion), diary farming, etc., as well as trade, connected with the arrival of the
Elam o-Dravidian speaking elite in the Indus Valley area - not, obviously, with any
Indo-Europeans.

TYPES OF LINGUISTIC EVIDENCE FOR EARLY CONTACT: INDO-EUROPEANS AND NON-INDO-EUROPEANS
Edgar C. Polome
University of Texas at Austin
Ever since the seminal work of U riel W einreich on Languages in
Contact (1953), which put the achievements of prior generations into perspective
and provided a model for the analysis and interpretation of the phonological,
grammatical and lexical interferences resulting from contacts between languages, a
whole array o f extensive studies in various fields have broadened and deepened
our know ledge o f the subject. It would indeed be fastidious to enumerate here the
multiple American and European publications dealing with languages in contact or
in conflict, with Sprachbunde, with the issues raised by pidginization and
creolization, plurilingualism, language death, the ethnography of communication
and so many other relevant topics. What concerns us most is what additional
insight these works have given us into the problem s pertaining to the early
linguistic contact between Indo-Europeans and non-Indo-Europeans.
It is ob viou s that we should not readily project into prehistoric
In do-E uropean tim es our findings on phenomena that we can document in
historical periods and sometimes even test in the field , and that the many factors
that condition the linguistic effects of socio-cultural interaction should be carefully
weighed before jumping to any conclusion from rash comparisons. My favorite
exam ple o f this kind of methodological error is the assumption by Sigmund Feist
in the late twenties (1928) and early thirties (1932) that the Germanic languages
resulted from the pidginization of the Indo-European language of Illyro-Venetic
traders by the non-Indo-European population of the Baltic area, allegedly
subm itted to the cultural domination of the entrepreneurial group carrying on
direct commercial relations with the Mediterranean. As proof of this hypothesis he
adduced the fact that the Germanic consonant shift reflected the spirantization of



268 When Worlds Collide
the Indo-European stops which was then believed to be documented by the Venetic
inscriptions, but it was soon established that the Venetic characters had been
m isinterpreted by Sommer (1924) and that they actually represented stops.
Moreover, the Venetic language was dissociated from the "Illyrian," as originally
conceived by Hans Krahe, to be treated either as an independent Indo-European
language or as a separate branch o f the Italic fam ily. Assuming "pidginization" in
P ro to -G erm a n ic on accou n t o f the a lleg ed "loss" o f a number o f features
recon stru cted by the N eogram m arians as part of the verbal system of
Proto-Indo-European, mainly on the basis of Sanskrit and Greek, is also a rather
specious argument, as the very same reconstruction is open for serious revision on
the basis of the later discovery of ancient Indo-European languages like Anatolian.
The fairly striking structural resemblance between the verbal system of Germanic
and that of H ittite rather makes one wonder whether these languages do not
actually represent a more archaic structural model than the further elaborated
inflectional pattern of Old Indie and Hellenic. Besides, neither Sigmund Feist nor
Giuliano Bonfante who espoused his views, did actually ever bother to back up
their hypothesis with a detailed examination of the non-linguistic evidence for the
presence o f the alleged "Veneto-Illyrians" in the Baltic area. To be sure, Venetic
roads across the Alps have been found, and trade routes between the Baltic and
the Mediterranean crossed Central Europe in the Bronze Age, but that does not by
far make the endeavoring people of the Este culture the linguistic "colonizers" of
the Germanic n orth-the more so as the lexical and other correspondences between
Venetic and Germanic are precious few and not very significant (Polome 1957)!
The idea that Germanic resulted from a "Sprachmischung" is not new: it
was already advanced by Sir William Jones in his famous discourse to the Royal
A siatic Society in Calcutta in 1786. In 1934 Hermann Guntert still defended the
same view: the Germanic people resulted from the mixture of the megalithic
agriculturists with the Battle-Ax/Corded-W are culture, and the neolithic peasantry
constituted the "substrate" responsible for the Germanic consonant shift (Guntert
1934: 72). Unfortunately, widely exaggerated claims on the impact and the extent
o f the a lleg ed "substrate" such as G iovanni A lessio’s assumption o f a "filone
mediterraneo” up to the Baltic contributed to discrediting hypotheses of this kind.



Polome 269
W hen the view s o f Hans K rahe on the prom inent role of the
"(Proto-)Illyrians" of the Lusatian civilization, backed up archeologically by
Richard P ittion i and linguistically by Julius Pokorny gave way in the middle
fifties to the concept o f an initially linguistically coherent Indo-European "Old
Europe" on the basis o f striking correspondences in the etyma and derivation of
the hydronyms, the differentiation of the Indo-European languages o f the continent
becam e a process of internal evolution, reminiscent of the developm ent of
"northwestern Indo-European," as sketched by Antoine M eillet half a century
earlier.
Was there a linguistic continuum in northwestern Europe that reflected the
civilization shared by the ancestors o f the Celtic, Italic, Germanic, Baltic (and
perhaps also Slavic) peoples? To back up this view a set of lexical correspondences
have been adduced: terms relevant to the ecology, i.e. names of trees such as the
willow or the elm, or animals such as the blackbird or the water-snake; words
relating to the cultivation of the land (*se- ‘sow,’ *bha bo- ‘bean,’ *gr,ano- ‘grain ,’
*sek- ‘cut, mow,’ etc.); institutional vocabulary, e.g., *wadh- / ‘p led ge, security,’
* gho s t i - ‘s t r a n g e r ’ > ‘g u e s t ’ (G o . g a s t s ) o r ‘f o e ’ (L a t. h o s t i s ) ,
* k e y -w o -l-m o - ‘homestead, fam ily,’ etc.; terms denoting human activities such as
"striking" in the specialized meaning of ‘forge’ (Lat. ciido, Lith. kauju) or taking,
buying" (Lat. emo, Lith. imu)\ m iscellaneous words such as *w rudbom ‘w o r d ,’
*ghamo‘n - ‘earthling’ (= ‘man’), *nizdos ‘nest,’ etc. This view has, however, been
strongly criticized by L.R. Palmer (1954: 17-23), as he pointed out that many of
these "occidental" words reflect "nothing more than elaborate argumenta ex
silentio resting on accidental loss by Greek" o f the same terms after their entry
into the Balkan peninsula. Each word has its own history, and its loss in a
language may be due to a lot of different motivations, so that the pattern of
correspondence from language to language depends essentially on the complex
in terp la y o f la rgely unpredictable factors: as Palm er n otices, why is "fire"
indicated exclusively by ignis in Latin and by p ir in Umbrian? Or, why is the
common term for "water" (IE *wedor, gen. udnes > Goth, wato, Umbr. utur) only
represented by unda ‘w ave’ in Latin? Similarly, *ner- ‘(strong) man’ survives only



270 When Worlds Collide
in the Sabine proper names Nero, Nerio, besides w iro -, in Latin, whereas it
appears commonly in Oscan (n'ur), Umbrian (лег/), Old Irish inert).
The Italian "Neolinguistica" accounted for this by applying the criteria of
linguistic geography to the geographical distribution of the Indo-European dialects.
According to this view , the languages originally located at the confines of
northwestern Europe were "peripheral" to the core of the Indo-European speech
community, and innovations affecting the central part of their vast linguistic
territory might therefore not reach its "marginal" areas, which would therefore
appear to be more conservative. Thus, for Matteo Bartoli (1945: 2-3), Lat. ignis is
more archaic than Umbr. pir, which, together with Greek пир and Hitt, pahhur,
belongs to the central part of the Indo-European territory, whereas ignis is
"peripheral” like Old Indie agniff. But, as Palmer (1951:28) rightly points out, as a
heteroclitic -r-/-n -stem , also found in such "peripheral" languages as Tocharian (B
puwar ‘fire’) and Germanic (Goth, fon [gen. funins], ON fyrr), PIE *peAur [g en .
p eA w en -; cf. Hitt, pahhwenas] belongs defin itely to the oldest lexical stock of
Indo-European. The fragility o f the criterion of Marginalita is also illustrated by
the case of Lat. aqua versus Umbr. utur. obviously, here again, the Umbrian word
reflects a term belonging to the oldest IE vocabulary, as its heteroclitic flection
indicates: Hitt, watar (= OS watar), gen. wetenas (cf. Goth, [gen.] watins). Aqua is
presumably related to the verb represented in Hittite by aku-, eku- and Tocharian
y o k - ‘drink’ (in spite o f Puhvel 1984: 268; cf. Tischler 1983: 104). Moreover, these
speculations on the distribution o f the reflexes o f such Indo-European terms as
"water" or "fire" fail to take into account such basic facts as the possibility that
several designations for them may have coexisted, differentiated by the context in
which they appeared and the people who used them: as Benjamin Lee Whorf
(1956: 210) showed (and it has been abundantly illustrated by anthropologists),
"languages classify items o f experience differently," and the Hopi, for example,
have two words for "water" - (a) running, in nature (pahe)\ (b) in various
containers ipehi). Obviously, the Indo-Europeans must have distinguished water in
nature from drinking water - or perhaps, taking into account the importance of
the association o f water and fire in their ideology, as Bernfried Schlerath (1973:
28-34) stressed it, the sacrality o f water might account for the coexistence of a



Polome 271
ritual term versus an everyday term, as the "animate" *egnis versus the "inanimate"
*peAur suggests it in the parallel case of the fire.
With the new perception of different registers and social stratification,
gained in the study o f sociolin gu istics, came a growing awareness among
Indo-Europeanists that contrasts between two levels of language such as a specific
set o f terms b elongin g to "sacred" vocabulary, pertaining to the usually more
conservative priesthood, and their "profane" correspondents, used by the rest of the
community, could be preserved, not only in such writings as the religious texts
opposing the language o f the gods to that o f the mortals, upon which Hermann
Gtintert had already drawn the atten tion in the twenties, but also in the
coexistence of different terms for the same entity, surviving with an often
unpredictable distribution in the various dialects. Examined in the light of the
Dumezilian functional tripartition of Indo-European society, the contrast between
*ner- and *utro- to denote a male human being (as opposed to a female), took on
a new significance as the former appeared to be linked with the two upper levels
o f society-brahm ins and кsatriyas in the V eda-an d the latter with the third or
lower level. Thus, a rationale is also given for the occurrence of * u iro - in the
name o f the third function god Quirinus and the derivation of the name of the
ancient cult-partner of Mars, Nerio, from *ner- (Dumezil 1969: 225-241).
In many cases also, some o f these "synonyms" attributed to various orders
of beings have no clear Indo-European etym ology, while others are clear reflexes
of PIE roots, e.g., in the 34th stanza of the Scandinavian Alvissmal, "beer" is called
<?/ "among men” - a term with undeniable magico-religious connotations, as Runic
alu shows, but with IE cognates, perhaps even in Hittite - b j 0 r r "among the
ALsir -a term which has been connected with byg g (from Gmc. *bewwu- ), but
which may rather belong to the monachal vocabulary and be linked with the
introduction o f hopped beer (< Vulgar Lat. biber ‘draught’) - and veig am ong the
Vanir: no convincing etym ology has been given for this term, which survives in
Norwegian veie ‘fluid, juice.’ It has been compared rather unconvincingly with such
sets as (a) Old Indie v e s a n t a - ‘pond,’ Latv. w i e k t s ‘ra p id s’; (b ) Old In die
v j I cj ‘w a v e ,’ MHG w e i g e n ‘sw a y , to tte r ’; (c) ON v e i g ‘s t r e n g t h ,’ G oth .



272 When Worlds Collide
waihjo ‘battle,’ OCS veku, Lith. vieka ‘strength’- i n the meaning o f "strong drink”!
In the aberrant overstating o f his concepts of Zaun und Mannring (‘fence and
circle o f men’), Jost Trier has even assumed a semantic development from "circle
o f men" to "communal banquet" to "festive drink," which would allow the
derivation o f the term from the same root *wey- as ON veggr ‘wall (originally, of
wickerwork),’ Latv. v ija ‘fence,’ etc.! Instead o f looking so far, would it not be
possible to assume that this isolated term reflects an old inherited name for a local
brew o f the original agricultural population of the north? A mixture of fermented
wheat grains, cranberries, bog-myrtle, linden pollen and honeywater has been
found in Egtved (Jutland) as early as 1500 B.C. in a birch-bark container in a
woman’s grave. It is, however, probable that such beverages were used for ritual
purposes long before the Bronze Age, and therefore quite plausible that the name
o f one such "liquor" could have been taken over from the language o f the
pre-Indo-European inhabitants of the area.
When dealing with pre-Indo-European "substrate" in northern Europe, the
major problem is that there absolutely no direct evidence o f the language of the
populations that the speakers o f Indo-European dialects encountered upon their
penetration into the area. It is therefore poor m ethodology to assume that the
idiosyncracies o f the Indo-European languages that developed later on the same
territory are ascribable to the influence of the linguistic patterns proper to the
non-Indo-European languages spoken by the local people who merged with the
immigrants to constitute the new Indo-European dialectal entities. So many
different things can happen when "cultures collide": at a certain stage, a certain
amount o f bilingualism is to be expected in which both languages are functional at
d ifferen t levels, e.g., the language of the dominant group being originally
restricted to use w ithin this group by its own members and to direct
communication with the overlords by the subordinate group, which would continue
to use their own tongue among themselves. The Hittites apparently maintained
their language in a vast empire in which the majority o f their subjects spoke
unrelated languages; after more than four centuries o f Roman occupation, the
parents o f the Latin poet Ausonius still spoke Gaulish at home. The form of the
ruler’s language used by the subdued is however likely to be pidginized: the



Polome 273
phonology o f the target language will be adapted to the basic sound system of the
native tongue o f the speakers - as is indeed argued by those who ascribe the
Germ anic consonant sh ift to the takeover o f an Indo-European dialect by an
originally non-Indo-European population; the morphology will be "simplified"—as
F. Sommer claimed the Anatolian verb system was under the influence of the
surrounding Semitic and other non-Indo-European languages; syntactic patterns
w ill be calqued on those o f the speaker’s mother tongue; the lexicon w ill be
pervaded with loanwords and loan-translations. The popular G allo-Latin
inscriptions on spindle whorls and the like attest to the kind of Mischsprache that
could develop under those circumstances (Meid 1980).
It is w ell-known that in such cases of unstable bilingualism where one
language of higher prestige tends to prevail, and where both languages L1 and
L2 can be acquired in childhood by younger generations, language shift is to be
expected. The question is: how much is the "new” language of those who shifted
affected by their linguistic background? When dealing with languages attested at a
fairly recent date, after the impact o f Christianization and of the translation of
religious texts as well as the influence of foreign models had affected their syntax,
it is rather unwise to try to ascribe to an unknown substrate some phenomena
characterizing their syntactic patterns typologically when they are documented only
many centuries and som etim es m illennia later. Sim ilarly, there are no
morphological features that can be referred without hesitation to a remodeling of
the PIE pattern triggered by the underlying influence of a lost substrate language.
Most o f the major divergences between the so-called "peripheral" languages like
Germanic and the core languages with highly developed nominal and verbal
morphology like Greek and Indo-Iranian can adequately be explained as the result
of a diachronic developm ent and diversification within Indo-European. If the
ancestors of the Germanic tribes separated from the Indo-European community
early enough, the absence of such tenses and moods as the aorist or the
subjunctive (the Germanic subjunctive being formally an IE optative) would be due
to the fact that these grammatical categories had not yet become operative in the
proto-language by that time and would account for the close resemblance of the
structural pattern of the Germanic verbal system with that of Anatolian. This



274 When Worlds Collide
implies, however, a staggered emigration of Indo-European groups out of
the core territory and their moving towards the northwest at a rather early
d a te-th e ancestors of the Germanic people leaving before those of the Celts and
the Latins, for example. Unfortunately, all this relative chronology remains based
on an argumentum ex silentio, and the fact that some linguistic feature is not
present in a language can always be explained in two ways:
(a) it was not there to start with (which is the assumption this chronology
is based on);
(b) it has been lost somewhere along the way (which is what more
traditional scholars assume).
In the latter case, the loss may be due either to internal development or to
the action o f outside causes - in the case of Germanic, perhaps, the influence of
"substrate" language? In the absence of any evidence of the morphological structure
of this substrate language, this remains, however, a moot question.
As regards phonology, again, the failure of the efforts to account for the
consonant shifts in Germanic or Armenian through the influence of the languages
of the original inhabitants of their present territories indicates the difficulty of
assessing any undisputable impact of a phonological system of which one has
actually no direct evidence on another which is derived from a reconstructed
language. The recent presentation o f the "glottalic" theory has indeed indicated
that a ty p o lo g ica lly ju stified revision of the Brugmannian pattern of the
Proto-Indo-European consonant system may provide a very elegant solution to the
Germanic consonant shift, which makes Proto-Germanic an archaic language and
reduces the so-called consonant shift to very simple processes of spirantization and
deglottalization: the feature [-continuant] of the sim ple/aspirate stops becomes
[+continuant], and the feature [+glottalic] of the "glottalized" stops become
[-glottalic] - a change that certainly does not require an outside influence!



Polome 275
D ifferent is the case when new phonemes are introduced in the language
o f the invaders from that o f the subdued: a typical exam ple is that of the Nguni
tribes moving south of the Limpopo and conquering vast territories occupied by
the Khoi in southern Africa. While most men were exterminated and women taken
in as concubines, a situation developed in which part of the phonology of the
defeated people survived in the language of the new masters of the land, namely
the characteristic click sounds, which are even more numerous in the hlonipha or
"respect" forms o f language used essentially by women. There is, however, no clear
evidence o f such an influence o f the substrate in northern Europe, though it has
sometimes been assumed to account for features in the vocalism of Germanic and
Baltic. Actually, when one analyzes the phonology o f Germanic, it is obvious that
it derives directly from the same Indo-European pattern as Latin or Greek, though
it has definitely been less conservative than the latter in the maintenance and
treatment o f "laryngeals." Whatever the ancestors o f the Germanic people may
have taken over from the "substrate" language(s) has been thoroughly adapted to
their phonological system - in the way loanwords from a "superstratum" can be
integrated into a language. In this case, indeed, two solutions are possible: (a) the
borrowing language ADDS "foreign" phonemes to its system as it borrows heavily
from a language with a different phonological system, e.g., the Bantus of the East
Coast o f A frica whose language became Swahili added dental spirants like [9] and
[3] to their phonem ic inventory to take care o f terms lik e thelathini ‘3 0 ’ or
dhamana ‘guarantee,’ but when the language spread inland, up-country Bantus
replaced [0] by / s / , e.g., in selasini ‘30’ or resorted to other terms (Shaba Swahili:
makumi fafi//*Roman*/) - which brings us to the second solution:
(b) the borrowing language SUBSTITUTES whichever of its own phonemes
appears to be closest to the foreign sound, e.g., / t / or / z / for [8].
This apparently accounts for the fact that non-Indo-European elements in
Germanic can only be traced etym ologically, and NOT through their aberrant
phonological pattern.
Because the "substrate" terms in the Germanic North have obviously been



276 When Worlds Collide
so com pletely integrated into the language, they w ill fall essentially into three
categories:
(a) those found only in ONE language where they reflect the local
eco lo g ic a l and econom ical con d itions, w h ile they are not ety m o lo g iza b le in
Indo-European;
(b) isoglosses lim ited to the Northwest Indo-European languages,
indicating the geographical, clim atic, botanical, zoological and other typical
features o f the area;
(c) cultural terms, among which onomastics take a special place.
It stands to reason that if we examine the lexicon of any of the Germanic
languages, we w ill find a considerable number of terms without known etymology.
Among these, such terms as names of plants or animals proper to the geographical
area in which the languages are used, are fairly numerous. Thus, in Dutch, for
instance, we could mention such words as goal ‘restbarrow,’ or magge ‘(eel)pout’
but could it be legitimate to project terms attested only in post-medieval sources
into the pre-Germanic times? To be sure, the older school of etymologists hardly
hesitated to do so, but after the severe, but fully justified criticism of de Vries’
speculations about prehistoric society in connections with the views of Jost Trier
on early forestry, wattling techniques and the like, one is rightly rather reluctant
to extrapolate from relatively recent data to archaic ecology. However, when a
lexical item lik e dialectal Germanic *w a ip - ‘sweetbrier’ occurs in Middle Dutch
(wepdoorrr, XVIth c. [Kiliaen] wepe, weype "Sicambr." [= dialect of Klevel), Middle
Low German {wipe, wepdorn, wependorn) and early New High German (wipken),
one really wonders whether this does not reflect an old inherited term, possibly
from the "substrate" language, though such an assumption remains obviously purely
conjectural!
Perhaps the name o f the "eel" provides a better case? Here, we deal with a
term documented in most of the older Germanic dialects: ON all, OE cel, OS al,



Polome 277
OHG al, MDu. ael, for which a number o f equally unconvincing explanations have
been proposed:
(a) it has been compared with ON all ‘gutter, drain; strip on the back of
an animal’ under the assumption o f a basic meaning "long thin thing," but Old
Indie а й - ‘line, stroke’ which is supposed to confirm this hypothesis, is probably a
non-Aryan word!
(b) it has been connected with Old Indie alam ‘roe,’ to w hich Norw.
ulke ‘old tar, sticky slime’ is perhaps related, so that it would be the "slimy fish"?
(c ) it has b een d eriv ed from the root * e d - ‘e a t’ as a r e fle x o f
*edlo- ‘eater’!
As R olf H iersche (1986:1) indicates, none of these explanations is
satisfactory, and in view of the fact that the other western Indo-European
languages commonly derive the term for "eel" (Lat. anguilla\ OPruss. angurgis,
Lith. ungurys, Polish wqgorz, etc.) from the word for "snake,” it is quite plausible
that Germanic *ela - ‘e e l’ reflects a "substrate" term, as Jan de Vries (1971:1)
suggested.
Som etim es p h on ology creates prob lem s in co n n ection w ith such
assumptions: thus, de Vries (1971: 518) intimates that Du. pier ‘(earth)worm’ might
be a "substrate" word because o f its geographical spread limited to the Low
C ountries and the n eighboring Low German territories (its occurrence in
Brandenburg is ascribable to m edieval immigration from the Low Countries). Its
vocalism suggests, however, an underlying form with Gmc. *ё2, but as this vowel
reflects an internal development in continental Germanic during the later Roman
imperial period, a difficult problem of chronology might be involved, though the
ё2 before / г / might also be of secondary origin.
In other cases, phonological features constitute the main argument for
postulating the "substrate" origin o f a term: thus, Gmc. * p a p a - ‘path’ (OE peed,



278 When Worlds Collide
pad, OFri. path, OHG p fa d , etc.) occurs only in the Ingweonic and Continental
dialects o f Germanic and therefore is considered as originating in a pre-Germanic
language o f the area rather than as a loanword from Iranian, where p a - В ‘way,
road’ occurs. The "unshifted" Germanic initial * p- excludes the possiblity of their
being direct cognates!.
Such a reference to the "absence o f the consonant shift" in a considerable
number o f Germanic terms has been the source of far-reaching assumptions in
recent years: Hans Kuhn worked out an extensive theory on the presence of an
"unknown Indo-European people" in the northwestern corner o f Europe on the
basis of the occurrence of a sizable number of terms with "unshifted" IE *p, *t and
*k. Toponymists had already pointed out that numerous place- and river-names of
the area appeared with -*apa as a second component, and Maurits Gijsseling had
posited the existence of a pre-Celtic "Belgian" in the Low Countries, but it was not
clear whether some o f these aberrant p-form s might not represent "labialized" IE
la b io v ela rs, e.g ., in *akwa ‘w ater.’ By p ositin g the existen ce o f an origin al
non-C eltic/non-G erm anic "Northwest block", H. Kuhn opened new perspectives,
and some archeologists backed up his findings by indicating how the corresponding
areas were also distinct in their prehistoric cultural heritage. Closer analysis
showed, however, that a large part of Kuhn’s material was unreliable and based on
recent developm ents, but quite a few terms listed by him were still wanting for a
satisfactory explanation. To try to respond to this need, Maurits Gijsseling
collected in a recent article on "substrate terms in Germanic" (1987) all the terms
he deem ed adequate to illustrate the im portance o f such a substrate in the
Ingweonic and northern continental Germanic languages (i.e., English, Frisian,
Dutch and Low German). What is the validity of this material? Is the methodology
applied to its examination and interpretation adequate? What positive results have
been attained?
There is a basic d ifferen ce between the alleged "substrate" m aterial
gathered by Kuhn and G ijsseling and what other scholars describe as the
"substrate" o f the northwestern Indo-European languages: in the latter case, we
deal with terms that are believed to have been taken over from the tongues



Polome 279
spoken by the pre-Indo-European populations of the area; in the former, we
assume the presence of an earlier Indo-European substrate which does not shift the
voiceless stops Ip t kl into the Germanic fricatives f /> x (with the application of
V erner’s Law: v 3 y). Thus, when Jan de V ries (1971: 634) doubts that it is
legitim ate to reconstruct an IE root *(s)kut- to account for OFri. s k e d d a , OS
skuddian, OLFrancon. scuddan (Du. schudden), OHD scutilon (G schutteln) ‘shake’:
OCS s k y t a t i set ‘v a g a r i’-w it h o u t in itia l *s~: OE h u d e n ia n ‘e x c u t e r e ,’ LG
hudern ‘tremble’: Lith. kutii, kuteti ‘shake up,’ as Julius Pokorny (1959: 957-958)
does, it is indeed plausible to assume that this set of terms occurring only in
continental Germanic, Baltic and Slavic might belong to the language of the
original inhabitants o f the southern Baltic area and have possibly been taken over
on account of some "expressive" connotation.
I have listed elsewhere (Polom e 1986) a number of such terms designating
animals such as the barrow, animal products such as the spawn of a fish, simple
implements (e.g., a vessel, a beaker), features of the environment such as a watery
deep, human feelings and perceptions (e.g., the word for "sour"), human activities
such "sweeping, scraping" or "digging" which Baltic and/or Slavic shares with
Germanic, and which have no Indo-European cognates, and could therefore well
reflect part o f the vocabulary o f the "substrate." The same goes for several
Germanic words which are totally isolated in Indo-European and denote animals
and plants and the products derived from them, e.g., the "gale" or "bog-myrtle”
(Gmc. * g a g l- and *pu rsa - ), the "mew" and "the dove," "tallow" and "roe,” etc.
Further work is certainly needed in that direction to identify which lexical items
relevant to the ecology o f northern Europe, but without acceptable Indo-European
etymology, may be derived from a substrate language.
The work done recently by W.P. Schmid and J. Udolph on the hydronymy
o f ancient Europe, as follow -u p to the research initiated by Hans Krahe around
1950, but focusing more sp ecifically on the Baltic and Slavic areas, has tended to
show that the oldest river-nam es throughout this northern territory would be
derived by typically Indo-European processes from recognizable Indo-European
roots, and if a similar conclusion were to be derived from the hydronymy of the



280 When Worlds Collide
oldest southern Germanic territory which Udolph is presently working on, the
w hole problem o f the "unshifted" p / t / k - terms in Germanic would have to be
reexamined in a new light. But before jumping to the conclusion that there might
have been an unknown Indo-European group preceding the coming of the
ancestors o f the Germanic people or not participating in the ethnogenesis of the
latter, if it coincides with the Jastorf culture as a number o f archeologists want us
to believe, let us examine the material adduced to back up such a claim.
A cco rd in g to G ijsselin g the alleged substrate "roots" fa ll into four
sem antic categories: (1) "desire" (Begierde); (2) "vital force" (Lebenskraft); (3)
"communication"; (4) "apathy.” For the f-term s, he however substitutes "energetic,
strong, excellent" for "vital force." This categorization then allows him to posit an
astounding number of homonymous "roots” with initial preconsonantal *(a)~ or with
*s- "mobile," e.g., *(a)per- :
(1) "desire, love, be happy" - expanded form *peret~, documented by Du.
pret ‘fun.’
(2) "strive for" - expanded forms * p e r e i-g h - (M Du. p rig en ) and
*perei-k- (MDu. prien ‘strive for’).
(3) "perceive, realize" - expanded form *perat- (OE prcett ‘trick, skill’).
(4) "press together" - expanded forms * p e r a p - (MDu. p r o p p e ‘plug,
wad’), *per-egh (with nasal infix: Goth, anapraggar?trouble, oppress’), * p er-al- (in
OFri. pralling ‘testicle’?), *per-em- (Du. pramen ‘compel’).
(5) "stick out" - expanded forms * p er-eg h - (OE p reg ‘pointed stick’),
* p e r -e g (ON fo r k r ‘bar, stick’), * p r e j - > * p re i-k - (OE prica, pricel ‘prickle’),
*prew - > *preun- (OE preon ‘awl, prick’). There is even a tentatively assumed
expanded form *par-es- allegedly documented by Flemish porre ‘wart.’6
(6) "announce, say" - expanded forms *prebh- (Du. prevelen ‘mumble’).



Polome 281
*per-at- (Du. praten ‘chat’).
With s - "mobile" the same root means "foam" and is alledly documented by
Du. proesten ‘wheeze and splutter.’
Similarly, a "root" *(a)pew- occurs with the meanings: (a) "strive for"; (b)
"fence in"; (c) "surround" > "skin"; (d) "take"; (e) "hit’; (f) "breathe"; (g) "give birth"
> "born, child, young"; (h) "swell"; (i) "stick out" - several o f them synonymous
with those o f *(a)per~. With s - "mobile" it means (a) "mud"; (b) "crush"; (c) "pull
o ff”; (d) "hollow."
It stands to reason that such a polysem y o f the "substrate" roots is
implausible, as too reminiscent of the same multiplicity of meanings ascribed to
Proto-Indo-European roots by Pokorny. Moreover, the listings of Gijsseling give
too often the im pression that he has gone through the Dutch etym ological
dictionary o f Jan de Vries (1971) and the older concise Old English one o f F.
Holthausen, pulling out all the terms with initial p -, t- and k - of unknown or
doubtful origin and lum ping them together under assumed PIE roots by
extrapolating their meaning or a kind of common denominator of the attested
meanings to their alleged original prototype. It hardly needs to be pointed out how
erratic and utterly subjective such an approach is, and classifying under "apathy"
such lemmas as *(s)pal- ‘swamp’ (OE pol ‘pool’), or *(s)pal- ‘stripe’ in its expanded
form *plogh~(ON plogr ‘plow ’), w hile deriving * p a l-a t- > *plat~, *palt- in OE
plot ‘piece of land’ from *(s)pel- ‘pull off,’ verges on the frivolous!
W hile it hardly makes sense to project into a pre-Germanic "substrate" a
late M iddle Dutch maritime term like *pte (Du. pijjekker = E pea jacket—a pilot’s
coat, presumably borrowed from Dutch into English), we should not reject the
whole set o f alleged "substrate" terms lock, stock and barrel. However, several
methological conditions should be met before considering them further:
(a) no capricious ad hoc reconstructions should be tolerated;



282 When Worlds Collide
(b) a careful distinction should be made between alleged substrate terms
which are recently documented and those for which there is evidence at an early
date; in the first case, the sociolinguistic and psychological reasons for its late
em ergence need to be investigated; in both cases, the m otivation for the
preservation of the substrate terms must be thoroughly examined;
(c) the geographical spread o f the alleged substrate forms needs to be
mapped and analyzed;
(d) affective vocabulary of recent origin should not be projected into the
proto-language; the existence of combinations of sounds with specific .symbolic
value in a language should be taken into consideration, e.g., in Dutch, the sequence
lpru-1 occurs in a number of derogatory terms applying to something of little
v a lu e, e.g ., p r u l ‘trash, junk,’ p r u t ‘m ud, s lu d g e ,’ Cadj.] ‘crum m y, lo u s y ,’
p r u ts e n ‘m ess a r o u n d ,’ p r u tte le n ‘gru m b le, g r o u s e ’ (th e la tte r a lso , an
"onomatopoeic" frequentative in the meaning "simmer, perk"). It stands to reason
that such term s, as w ell as those which fa ll under the heading o f "sound
symbolism" (Lautsym bolik), e.g., Dutch terms beginning with p r-\ prakken ‘m ash,’
pramen ‘prod,’ prangen ‘press’—or pi-: plodderen, pledderen, ploeteren ‘plod away,
slog, plug,’ should not be extrapolated into ill-defined substrate languages.
(e) the terms should not be pressed into vague general semantic
categories, as it is more plausible that specific words with well-defined meaning
were taken over from the underlying "substrate" language, e.g., designations of
characteristic features of the local culture. This applies to the case of OE
plica ‘evil spirit,’ from which ON puki ‘devil,’ which appears only late, essentially
in the Christian literature, presumably derives. OE риса is probably also the
source o f the Celtic terms: W pwca, pwci, Ir. риса, which G ijsseling leaves out
when he claim s that the Old English term is related to Lith. puksti ‘snort, puff’
under the root * (a )p ew - ‘breathe’ and assum es a further connection with Du.
spook ‘ghost.’ In doing so, he neglects to account for the phonological discrepancy
between the Old English form with [u:] and the Dutch with an underlying [au]

(Gmc. *spauka-) and to look into the socio-cultural background of the terms. Jan

words reflecting an alternation piuka~pauka~puka, e.g., Swed.dial. p ju k ‘height,

derives from a root meaning "blow, blow up," also attested by MDu. poke ‘bag’ (de
Vries 1971: 539), but he rejects (1971: 682) its relationship with Du. spook, which
has cognates in East Frisian (spok) and Low German (spok) in the meaning ‘ghost’
and in Scandinavian in divergent meanings: Swed. spok ‘scarecrow,’Dan. sppg ‘joke,
fun,’ Norw. s p jo k ‘ghost’ (Kluge 1975: 733). Gmc. * sp o k - has been compared to
Latv. s p lg a n a ‘apparition in the air, dragon, witch,’ but as the related Baltic
terms: Lith. sp in giu , sp in g eti ‘gleam , glitter,’ OPruss. sp a n x ti ‘sp a rk ,’ L atv.
s p ig a n is ‘w ill- o ’-th e -w is p ,’ ind icate, there are serious phonological problems
involved in this connection. Perhaps this is the very reason why we might assume a
non-Indo-E uropean background for this set of terms designating phantomlike
apparitions: we would then deal with a reflex of animistic beliefs of the megalithic
agriculturists or an even older culture of the Baltic area!
Though it is not possible to survey all the adduced examples within the
scope o f this presentation, a few samples may further illustrate the various aspects
of the question:
(a) the dictionary of K iliaen (1596) lists as VETUS a Dutch term
poest glossed as bubile, i.e. ‘cowshed,’ which survives dialectally in Flemish as
p o ester. its <oe> [u] represents the normal development o f the Ingweonic [o:l
resulting from the raising and com pensatory lengthening o f Gmc. / а / in the
sequence *-ans~, as in dialectal Dutch (S. Holland) boes ‘part o f the cowshed’
versus LG banse ‘granary’ (van Loey 1970: 27); it is derived with the same suffix
- s t - as Goth, bansts ‘barn,’ and its "root” *pan- can also be found in E pen which
has been recorded only as ‘enclosure for domestic animals’ since the XIVth c., but
appears as OE penn with an ill defined meaning (possibly ‘hurdle’?). The antiquity
o f the Gmc. stem is evidenced by OE onpennad ‘unpenned, opened’ from a verb
*pennian ‘enclose, confine.’ A direct connection with E pin on the basis o f the LG
verb pennen ‘bolt’ remains unconvincing, though the Germanic terms borrowed



284 When Worlds Collide
from Latin pinna or Vulgar Latin *penna (Frings) with the original meaning of
"pointed object, peg, pin" have partly overlapped semantically with the derivations
from Gmc. *pan~, which could very w ell come from a substrate language in view
of its limited distribution in the Ingweonic area.
(b) the same geographical argument could be used to account for Du.
pees ‘tendon, sinew; string,' and the related pezerik ‘p izzle,’ as w ell as this English
term itself, if E p izzle which is documented only since the XVIth c. as peezel,
p yse ll, is not borrowed from Flemish pezel (= LG p esel, peisel), dim inutive of
MDu. peze (= MLG pese). Du. pees has been compared with OInd. bisam ‘shoot or
stalk of the lotus,’ but this term is presumably of non-Aryan origin (Mayrhofer
1963: 433). It is therefore plausible to consider the M iddle D utch/M iddle Low
German word as a reflex of a substrate word, but not necessarily belonging, as
Hans Kuhn (1969: 364) postulates, as * p e s- ‘p en is,’ to his alleged "Northwest
block." Though the Dutch derivative pezerik designates the penis of such animals
as the bull or the pig, this meaning is only secondary, so that a direct connection
with Greek neo?, OInd. pasah , etc. is less than obvious. Actually, it is not
necessary that the Germanic terms with initial p -, k -, t- be borrowed from a
substrate pre-Germanic northwestern European Indo-European language which
does not shift the voiceless stops to voiceless aspirates. Taking into account the
"glottalic" theory, it would be perfectly plausible to have a substrate language with
v o ic e le ss g lo tta liz e d stops: these would be taken over as such in early
Proto-Germanic and be "deglottalized" together with the inherited PIE glottalic
stops, when IE *p‘ t' k’ went to Gmc. p t k. If one does not accept the glottalic
theory, the alternative solution would be that the substrate languages would not
have a system without initial *b- as PIE is assumed to have had, so that the
Germanic * p - forms which are by far the most numerous would reflect "substrate”
terms with initial *b~.
Actually, the evidence for allegedly "unshifted" initial * t- and *k- is not
very strong. One o f de Vries and Gijsseling’s examples is the word for "nipple”:
Du. tit (K iliaen [1596] mentions titte as Saxon, Frisian and "Sicambrian” [=Kleve
dialect]), MLG titte, Late MHG zitze, OE tilt, Norw.dial. titta - a term which is



Polome
also widely attested in the Romance languages and is generally associated with
"baby talk." On account of Greek XIX0OC ‘mother’s breast,’ it is assumed that these
words have been borrowed from a pre-Germanic "substrate" language, but Ш 0О? is
clo sely link ed with xtx8 r) ‘(wet-)nurse,* a hypocoristic form with "expressive
gem ination" o f xix0 r|vr| ‘(w e t-)n u r s e ,’ a re d u p lic a ted form o f th e root o f
0 n a 0 a t ‘suck; nurse’ (Chantraine 1977: 1118). Accordingly, it should not be taken
into consideration when discussing the Germanic words: the parallel Du.
tepel ‘nipple,’ whose cognates (LG tippel [= Kiliaen tippel], MHG zipfel) mean "tip,
point," suggests "sound symbolism," the initial syllable t i - indicating something
pointed. It is therefore unwise to look for a "substrate" origin in a case like this.
In other cases, the "substrate" hypothesis w ill have to be rejected for
chronological reasons as a result of an examination of the history of the relevant
term, e.g., MDu. plunderen, Fri. plunderje, plonderje, MLG plunderen ‘loot, rob
forcibly,’ a typical "coastal term" which spread inland (into late MHG [plundern])
and appeared in England (E plunder) only in the XVIIth c., first with reference to
the Thirty Years War (ca. 1630), and then, to the Civil War (in 1642). It actually
means ‘to rob o f household effects’ (= MDu. plunder, MLG plun der [w a r el, late
MHG plunder ‘bedclothes, clothing, household stuff’). It is apparently originally
restricted to a lim ited territory, but there is no clue that authorizes us to derive it
from an older non-Germanic source!
In conclusion, in many cases the evidence remains inconclusive, and only
when extralinguistic evidence can be coordinated with the lexical data can we
posit a "substrate" origin o f the terms. Only along such lines w ill etymological
study contribute to a better understanding of the cultural and ecological situations
hinted at by archeology and other methods of reconstructing the prehistorical past!

THE PRE-INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE OF
NORTHERN (CENTRAL) EUROPE
Eric P. Hamp
(University of Chicago)
1. On Indo-European Dialectology
First, some prelim inaries, which I compress greatly. For any fam ily of
languages o f an interesting diversification over an interesting amount o f time, for
which in light of our experience of about two centuries a spread of five or six
millennia is certainly sufficient, there will be a diaclectology represented in the
branches that have diversified. I personally take it as axiomatic for linguistic
com parison not m erely that a d ialectology is possible but that in fact no
com parative problem should be addressed without taking overt account of the
implied dialectology in every solution. Diagram One can be regarded, if you will,
as a Schleicherian stemma and as a provisional answer to the question: "What did
the Indo-European fam ily look like at some time?” But, more importantly, we may
use this diagram as an ongoing worksheet to apply to any problem. Every solution
must either conform to our proposed dialectology, or it must contribute to a set of
answers which are su fficien tly serious to force us to alter our diaclectology.
Therefore, evefy time we compare it is no longer sufficient simply to state an
equivalence; we must plot the facts on our provisional diversification tree so that,
if anything violates an assumed branching, it must either be discarded, and the
hypothesis rejected as unacceptable, or it must alter our tree. It is not our task just
now in the present paper to consider the genetic dialectology of Indo-European,
but we can remember such items as ‘barley’ (Hamp 1985a) as a handy illustration
o f what could be considered shared archaisms, and also of what must be
innovation. You must rank these. Shared innovations, which are diagnostic, will
then show the proper criteria for sub-grouping. I have discussed (Hamp 1985b) the
question o f innovations at som e length in a treatment of a long-debated
etym ological syndrome in connection with the Greek lexeme trp i. See also Hamp
1977a on OE leod and related forms and on the West IE suffix *-n - for chiefs of
social units.

2. Argumenta ex silentio
There is the problem of argumenta ex silentio which we must always bear
carefully in mind; those false scents have unfortunately confused our deliberations
in the past-alm ost in a traditional fashion. Certain of these have been paraded
constantly: the Latin thematic genitive singular, for example. People have even
tried to squash the phonology to get four segments of vowels and consonants to
squeeze down into a single "i.” And there have been quite extensive arguments
based on the apparent absence of *-osio in Latin, as contrasted with Faliscan.
Now, we have since found that the su odales V alesiosio, that is, P o p lio sio , o r
P o b lio s io (if that’s the way he called h im self) show us that just within the
precincts of Latium itse lf at Satricum we had a p erfectly acceptable
Indo-European formation, and that the genitive singular of V aleri just does not
enter into the question (Hamp 1984a:185).
Another example is the supposed absence of the word for daughter in Celtic.
Some years ago, Enrico Campanile pointed out that Bonfante had earlier ignored
what M ichael O’Brien some thirty years ago now had shown: that early Irish
attests this word in a frozen form in its onom astics, i.e. in women’s names,
gynonyms, I guess we should call them. The fact is now, of course, that on the
beautiful new Gaulish inscription from Le Larzoc we have the word itself, and in
exactly the same form, I am pleased to say, that I predicted ten years ago (Hamp
1975a), i.e. with only tw o syllab les in the stem: d u x tir, as we now read it.
Therefore, this means that, in problems of sub-grouping and genetics, we should
by now have learned our lesson. One would hope we had, so that we would not
need preparatory rem arks every tim e we turn around; more and more in
Indo-European studies we find the need to make prefatory remarks that should
have been covered in any beginning course, not just in linguistics, but in some
elementary course in logic.3
3. On Substrata
Having got these general questions out of the way, we now turn to certain
shared traits which raise the problem of substrata. Substrata have been understood
in at least two ways. As we know, some people immediately shy away from
substrata and condemn everything that mentions the name as something to be



Hamp 293
autom atically rejected; one presumably rejects the notion on grounds of not using
loose argum ents anchored only in thin air. On the other hand, one also
disassociates oneself from the supposed other group that invokes substrata for
every set of facts or for even a single fact which cannot be substantiated
anywhere else. I take substrata in an entirely different sense: briefly put, evidence
o f substrata, by definition, will be traces of material that fail to find a correlation
in 'any large body o f fu ll language documentation. When we possess such
documentation we just call it by name: we say, for exam ple, that something in
English or in French has been borrowed from e.g., German or learned Latin or
even British Celtic or Gaulish because we have a body of known linguistic
material called German or Latin or Gaulish. But when we possess no body of data
such as that, yet find traits which cannot by a set of orderly reasoning be assigned
within a stemma such as we have just discussed, which thus cannot be fitted into a
genetic dialectology, but which yield subgroups in effect cross-cutting established
branchings, then we are talking about material which is susceptible of being
assigned to substrata.
My further requirement, one which rules out a good many claims, even some
that have been tabled at this meeting, is that we cannot fasten upon single facts.
This means that we cannot seize upon a single isolated personal name. So, for
instance, if we find something like Venet(o)i in Europe that can of itself never be
conclusive because it depends on only one chain of elements in an equivalence. We
must insist on multiple sets o f equivalencies between different terms. In other
words, we require n1 + n2 = n3 ... - nq, and then a d d ition ally homomorphous
distributions of the form m1 = m2 ... m4 and so forth, l 1 = l 2 ... I4. N ote that we
must have homomorphous distributions of multiple sets o f equivalencies. It is the
same formal requirement, o f course, that we insist on for demonstration of genetic
Lautgesetze. Finally, for acceptable substrata, when we finish stating these
quivalencies, we must make a cohesive statement of structural features which are
to be assigned to those summaries of homomorphous equivalent sets. Only then can
we say we have a substratum worth talking about. Until those requirements have
been fu lfilled you may have an interesting breakfast observation, but you do not
have an argument.



294 When Worlds Collide
4. "North Europe” and Its Periphery
Now, where do we find configurations of this sort? Gradually, it has seemed
to me more and more as I look at these data, albeit not as a determined object of
inquiry—I did not set out personally to explore Northern Europe, but as a repeated
set o f observations w hile I worked through things, that items keep dropping out
into patterns that I have just alluded to, giving us an entity which we might call
"North Europe." It has, so to speak, a heartland, and it has a periphery; therefore,
we find that for North Europe the material is to be seen underneath the
Indo-European branches known as Germanic, B alto-Slavic (I use the hyphen
advisedly), and Albanian; I also believe that Albanian belongs to the last with a
hyphen, too, but with a less close binding hyphen: Albanian plus Balto-Slavic.
Unfortunately, scholars don’t think o f Albanian as often as they should, and so it
is not so obvious a connection as Balto-Slavic with a hyphen. Note that I now see
the gen etic connection of Albanian to B alto-Slavic much more clearly and
positively, on the basis o f work that I have published in the meantime, than I did
in Hamp (1966:117-9, especially arts. 15-16). Then there is Celic, less closely
bound to these. I also find that the Prehellenic elem ent that is disclosed
underneath Greek, and which was called Pelasgisch or P'elasgique by Georgiev and
van W indekens and some others (but in certain details with different rules from
those which I use in my interpretation), also belongs in this North Europe
aggregate for substratal evidence; I have discussed Prehellenic questions over the
past decade in the pages of Ziva Antika, e.g., in Hamp 1983a.
T his m ust be d iffe r e n tia te d from w hat we w ould c a ll "W estern
Indo-European," on which see Hamp (in press a), (1976), and later issues of
Indogermanische Forschungen and which might be regarded loosely as a candidate,
but not yet w ell substantiated, genetic grouping and which covers over M eillet’s



Hamp 295
Northwest.1 The last is not very w ell developed form ally, as we all know, in his
own elaboration of it, but the makings of some things are clear there (see also
Hamp 1961, 1988), and in some other aspects of Hans Kuhn’s N ordw estblock. In
those arguments we have, if you like, mostly the makings of some type of genetic
possibility for Indo-European.
I exp licitly leave out o f account here Hans Kuhn’s presumably Indo-European
Nordwestblock, on which see most recently and searchingly Meid (1986). I likewise
pass over the elusive purely Indo-European problem of "Alteuropaisch," on which
see W.P. Schmid (1986).
In this Northern European group, however, we are speaking of an areal
grouping that reflects, if view ed d escriptively and contemporaneously, a
Sprachbund relation, but if viewed diachronically, the result of contact with a
substratum. There is also a periphery to this area, you might say, less well
naturalized by its substratal linguistic influence. In this respect, I speak now as a
linguist, and I would like to encourage the entry of other cultural dimensions into
the computus. I refer here to a linguistic fringe area, most readily perceived on
the western edge, namely the Celtic fringe. We call this periphery "western" mainly
because of its modern position. By modern, I refer to the last two and a half or
three millennia. When we speak o f Northern Europe, not as a genetic subgroup
but as a Sprachbund, the fringe (Celtic) area may geographically more properly be
called something like "central." Perhaps we are talking about facts relating roughly
to territory between the Schwarzwald and Hallstatt, or maybe extending even so
far over and down as Pannonia or the Vojvodina. We are not, I would submit,
talking about Sumadija and certainly not about Paeonia or the Vardar basin. We
are not speaking about the Cisalpine areas of northern Italy; we are also not
speaking about the uplands south of Hamburg.
The C eltic fringe is less integrated into our Sprachbund in the sense that
certain fa cts, for instance the vocalism , depart from the typ ifying
Sprachbund characteristics; this fringe was never naturalized so completely, it did
not diverge so fully or in the same way from its Indo-European background.
1. On this matter, see further Hamp 1974a.



296 When Worlds Collide
There were other features about Celtic besides the vocalism that class it, if you
like, as mor Brugmannian than Germanic and Balto-Slavic, e.g., the less sweeping
merger in Celtic of the aorist and perfect.
5. The Phonology of "North Europe”
Now let us look at some o f these features which we can assign to this North
European substratum. I would submit that we find a syndrome of phonological
features which have been stronger in convincing me o f the integrity of this set of
facts than almost anything else. They persuade me more strongly than the lexicon
simply because lexicon, which is usually the favorite object in such discussions,
though highly persuasive in its individual items, is much more difficult to allot to
the necessary syndromes of homomorphous distributions. It is harder to find a
structural cohesion within lexicon, as we all know, than a cohesion in phonology.
The first phonological fact is one which I have discussed in Hamp 1979a and
can be illustrated briefly, simply by picking out the Celtic and Latin reflexes of
some w ell known entities. If we take the word for ‘sea,’ for which we would not
be surprised to find a loan since the Indo-Europeans were not a maritime folk,
Old Irish m uirn (which is a neuter, as the nasalization shows, even though there
was not etym ologically a nasal at the end of that particular word) is by common
consent equated with Latin mare. Yet muirn has a vocalism which must be credited
to о descriptively within Proto-C eltic, and we know that Celtic *o does not
formally match Latin a. Similarly, Old Irish and Modern Scottish Gaelic lock and
L a tin la c u s ‘la k e ’ f a i l to g iv e a c a n o n ic a l e q u a tio n . W e see the sam e
correspondence more elaborately in the words for ‘apple’ and ‘apple tree,’ which
give us a semantic set matching very well also in its morphology.
OIr. ubull n. Welsh afal m. Lith. obuolas OCS jablbko < *эЫи
aball f. afall f. obelis jablanb < эЬэ1-п
For these we then reconstruct an initial vowel which must be different from
both an Indo-European *o and an *a in conventional terms. N ote that we have
fixed upon Latin and Irish, both of which maintain distinct reflexes of IE *o and
*a. This leads us to the observation that we reach a reconstructed state of affairs
with only four distinctive vocalisms: [i e u э], as I have argued in Hamp 1979a. In
turn, we may now understand how it is that North European Indo-European



Hamp 297
genetic branches underwent regular Brugmannian mergers of IE *o and *a. Such an
*a - *o merger precisely fits within this substratal correspondence. In other words,
it seems as if the northern genetic branches of Indo-European within Europe were
spoken by people applying the native phonology of their language which lacked a
low back d istin ction in vocalism that econom ical Brugmannian phonology
analytically requires.
Then let us look at certain Germanic terms most elaborately displayed, it just
happens, in Old English:
OE mag < *megaz ‘kinsman’ < *meko
OE maga < *megan- ‘son’ < *mekon~
OE magu < *maguz ‘son’ -» *magm > Goth, mawi
*тэк-й~ -> *magep- ‘girl’ > OE maeg(e)p < *т эк-'а
*magu- ‘servant’ = OIr. mug, W m eu-dwy < *m9ghu
(*т эк-й- > т еэк-о- = mek'o-)
W e see here a word with an apparent Germanic long *ё for ‘kinsman’ for
which I give a .hypothetical pre-Verner reconstruction, and a word for ‘son’ which
is an л-stem individuated noun formed on the same stem. Another word for ‘son,’
a м-stem with a short vow el, also gives some feminizations; in its pre-Verner form
this stem looks as if it were a correctly formed zero-grade participle for a very
early stage o f Indo-European. Feminized, we arrive perfectly at a form for ‘girl.’
For clarity I then note a fact which I think all the handbooks merged with some
o f the above forms o f Germanic; this is shown by the apparently cognate matching
Celtic forms to have the same *э vocalism that we have already disclosed above.
Therefore ‘servant’ originally had a first syllable different from what we must in
‘son’ call a *schwa: I call it a *schwa because it has the property whereby in a
derivative with thematizing Brugmannian short a the obligatory e-insertion' links
with the schwa elem ent (as though an inherited laryngeal in Indo-European
phonology) to give a long *e. In other words, all o f these forms show perfectly
good grammatical formation rules that we know from Indo-European.
We can now write a derivation for the Celtic words for ‘son’:
*тэк~й— > *makw-o- > *makv o > m apo- > W mab
-* Ogam MAQQA- > Oir. macc
Therefore, this recovers for us an etymon with *schwa in the first syllable



298 When Worlds Collide
contrasting with what we are writing with "turned с.” I have written about this in
Hamp (1979:166, footnote 10) and (in press b). Thus, for this language of North
Europe we recover a five-vow el system which we can label using our customary
symbols [i e u and a central schwa vocalism to be distributed amongst these.
This language also shows violations o f Indo-European phonotactic rules or
Indo-European inventory. For instance, the famous Indo-European gap that our
colleague Thomas Gamkrelidze has discussed in such elaboration in his glottalic
theory, the rare Brugmannian *b, appears in the ‘apple’ word. In fact, Germanic is
rather well supplied with *p from apparent *b (e.g. Eng. play, spell, ship, etc.). We
also have the violation o f m edia plus m edia, which is virtually excluded in
Indo-European root forms. This sequence shows up in a number o f Germanic
bases, where it can be seen very easily: e.g. Engl, cut, ON kvett ‘meat,’ kjQt n. <
*ketu < *gedu (Hamp 1975b). It is easy, we now know, in Balto-Slavic and also,
in cid en tally, in Albanian (when these show the desired etymon) to see the
d ifferen ce betw een an aspirata and a media; but in Celtic, unfortunately, we
cannot so readily see this; therefore, our evidence sometimes is hobbled by a
dearth of criterial evidential m aterials. These phonological violations of
Brugmannian Indo-European again show us a set of properties which occur in
syndromes.
It is not necessary for us in our present context to discuss Wagner 1964,
which, interesting though it is and revised by more recent fieldwork, is occupied
rather with the typology of phonetics, allophonics, and phonology (esp. of word
accent and consonants) found in the northernmost zone or Eurasia. This by
definition would be areal, and not a prehistoric language.6
6. Morphology
Instances o f morphology are much harder to find; after all, we are dealing
with a pitifully small corpus. Even so, I have been struck repeatedly by the fact
that items put into this category display an unusual affinity for *u at the end of
their stem, not a very ordinary thing in Indo-European forms. I list here certain of
them that I have discussed under this rubric in one place or another: эЫи, maghu-,
т а ки -, gedu , linghu ‘heather,’ sa lu ‘a seaw eed ,’ т э е к к и - ‘sw in e,’ su k u — »
sukko- ‘swine,’ b(h)anu- or gwanu- ‘piglet.’



Hamp 299
Also, with Celtic again somewhat on the edge and less integrated with the
other branches, there is a strong fusion of what, from an Indo-Europeanist point
of view, we call the aorist and perfect systems of the verb. However, we do not
have the proper leisure here to discuss this at all satisfactorily in view of the
vexed Anatolian question. I simply point out the possible correlation we could see
for assignment of tense/aspect functions in this putative substratal language.
There is, thirdly, the linkage o f relative and definite forms. Celtic shows this
in the complementarity of *-io and *-to in the relative forms of the verb, as I see
them. Germanic shows it in what has the appearance of a relative function for
‘d efin ite’ or deictic or anaphoric shapes, in other words *•/>-, *s~, or *ei. Prokosch
(1939:277) must be essentially correct; Germanic would have exploited the
inherited forms from correlative constructions such as we see in Skt. ya d ... tad.
B alto-Slavic shows it in the elements suffixed to modifiers in the noun phrase, the
so -c a lle d d efin ite forms o f adjectives, beside the OCS relative i-ze . Albanian
shows it in the conflation of form found in the postposed definite marker (masc.
sg: * -y, pi. -te , for exam ple) with the attributive prefix of concord (г, te, etc.) <
the Indo-European relative pronoun which associates d efin ite marking with
relative marking in the noun phrase construction.
It is p o ssib le that the animate suffix in * - g - which I have reconstructed
(Hamp 1983b, 1987a) for B alto-S lavic and Germanic also rests on a "North
Europe" substratum.7*
7. Grammatical Lexicon
To begin with, I suggest we abandon the search for isolated lexemes. It is not
profitable to ponder whether to adopt an item or to reject it without some
constraining principle that helps to eliminate chance and the sheer possibility of
oversight or undue emphasis through whimsical choice. Rather let us take items in
the context of linkages with other grammatical facts that impart a finite scope.
We may consider the word for ‘fist’ (Baltic *kum psti- < pu nksti- , S la v ic
*pqsti, Germanic *funhsti- < *pnkws ti-) in relation to the Germanic ordinal < IE
*pnkw- to - ‘fifth ’ and its integration into the ordinal systems (Hamp 1970). On the
other hand, the form for ‘thousand’ (Lith. tukstant- OCS tysosti, Goth, pusundi <
*tuH -sk-(o)n t-) looks like a participle of some type of inceptive or continuative



300 When Worlds Collide
verb, for details see Hamp 1973b.
8. Cultural Lexicon
Here we seek syndromes of forms from a Bedeutungsfeld, e.g. terms for the
pig and swine, on which see in extenso Hamp 1986a, 1986b, 1987b, in press c, d.
There is also a fin ely structured lexical set which I shall discuss in detail
elsew here comprising terms for the bee (Hamp 1971), wax (Hamp 1974b:36), and
the bear as man’s greatest and tabued competitor for honey. These related terms
all congruently cover precisely our area, showing attestations in Balto-Slavic,
Germanic, and Celtic; however, the last group is again peripheral since the tabu in
Celtic was weaker and failed to oust *artos, the old Indo-European reflex.
Another sem antic syndrome o f interlocking terms comprises ‘bones,’ ‘legs,’
‘ribs,’ and ‘branches’ in Baltic, Slavic, Germanic and Celtic (Hamp 1985c).
Silver (Hamp 1973c) is obviously o f cultural interest for the possible question
of control of knowledge, advent, and flow of metals.
The careful sifting o f "Indo-European" roots is certain to disclose more
candidates for the North Europe lexicon, e.g., Hamp 1985d.9
9. Uncertain Areas
There are certain limited areas for which we do not yet know the extent or
true affiliation; these involve incomplete congruencies. For example, we observe
(Hamp 1967) a word for ‘blackberry’ in Celtic (sm iya r 0 ) which turns up for
‘raspberry’ in Romanian (zmeur'a). We may speculate that we see here the presence
o f Celts in the Carpathian area responsible for this. But just where the source is to
be placed and what type of fruit with small seeds this really denoted are questions
we cannot yet answer. There is a seaweed *wis-m on - in the northwest attested in
Celtic and paralleled in Germanic (Hamp 1979b); merely, you might say, an item
o f the landscape along the North Sea Coast. In other words, this could be a
question o f pragmatics and situational semantics as opposed to anything structured
in the grammar of the substratum. Again, we find a different dialectological range
for OS, OHG, and MLG horstlhurst, OE hyrst; OIr. crann vs. British and Gaulish
pren n o- ‘tree, wood,’ Welsh p ry s ‘brushwood,’ which might point to a source in
Central Europe in common with Rom. zmeura (Hamp 1979c).



Hamp 301 W e must be prepared to see an untidy set of intruding elements which can not
be claimed every time to be a fragment of evidence for our major subject, but it
may simply be an intrusion from some other set of phenomena. The important
thing is to see the structure o f our main object o f investigation rather than to
argue about the possible relevance or dispensibility of causal intrusions. We can
actually recover from these later Indo-European branches a substantial number of
characterizing traits to attribute to the pre-Indo-European "North Europe" language.

306 When Worlds Collide Discussion
Tom Markey: This paper is now open for discussion.
Karl Horst Schmidt: I think that this paper presents so many problems that it is
d ifficu lt to concentrate on just one o f them. I will restrict my comments to the
position o f Celtic within Indo-European. Do you really think that, and I am very
interested in this, that Celtic is one of the North European languages and has
connections with Germanic, Balto-Slavic, Albanian, and Pelasgian (Prehellenic)? Is
that correct?
Eric P. Hamp: Yes, and incidentally, this is coded on Diagram One.
Karl Horst Schmidt: As a connection you have the m edio-passive in Germanic,
Celtic, B alto-Slavic, and in Albanian, but most restricted there. I certainly see that
Celtic has some patterns that are shared. Then, there is a second general problem.
I think the more Celtic inscriptions one finds and decodes, and you gave the
exam ple of d u xtir, and there are other examples in other inscriptions, then the
more Brugmannian Celtic becomes. There is also the question of the s yo - future.
So, I have the impression, on the basis of new discoveries, that Celtic is becoming
more and more Brugmannian, particularly so the deeper and older the inscriptions
are that we discover.
Tom Markey: Is there a reply to this?
Eric P. Hamp: Very briefly. Thank you, Karl. I agree almost com pletely with
everything that you have said. I agree that the more we find of Continental Celtic,
which is priceless and often crucial, the more our picture fills out. I agree with
your remarks, for instance, on the syo - future. I would call it the irrealis, which
has become dialectally both future and subjunctive. On the other hand, when I say
that Celtic is peripheral, we then envision a European Indo-European dialect just
as Brugmannian as you can make it.
Colin Renfrew: What does Brugmannian mean?



Hamp 307
Eric P. Hamp: It is an adjective based on the name of Karl Brugmann, the author
of the Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen.
Colin Renfrew: That I know, but specifically?
Eric P. Hamp: Yes. This means that it has a certain set of features of grammatical
description, which, for example, include certain traits that were for a long time
viewed as the obvious characteristics that every respectable ancient Indo-European
language had. In other words, a kind of grammar that looks like a crossbreed, you
might say, between M cDonell’s Vedic grammar, as opposed to Whitney’s, which
was classical Sanskrit, and your old school classical Greek grammar when filled
out with the introductory grammatical notes to your handbook of Homer; if you
add to that Old Irish grammar, which people generally don’t learn in the same
way, then this is Brugmannian grammar.
Colin Renfrew: Thank you.
Eric P. Hamp: But I would say that Celtic is very Brugmannian. However, by
moving into this substratum area of North Europe and taking up residence there,
their interbreeding with the natives brought in som e intrusions into the
Brugmannian structure; however, their intrusions were fewer that those of their
Germanic and Balto-Slavic neighbors. That is the sense in which I say I agree.
Colin Renfrew: Could you possibly say something more about how we identify
Prehellenic and/or Pelasgian and, secondly, about how we assign it such a
classification, which I think presents difficulties historically? I am not especially
fam iliar with the literature so as to be entirely confident as to how we distinguish
between Hellenic and Prehellenic.
Eric P. Hamp: Very simple. In order to distinguish them you test everything just as
you do an yw h ere e lse w ith a com parative problem in a gen etic group. In
Indo-European, for instance, we take a set of forms and test them with a
provisional set o f rules. Now, certain words won’t yield to the Greek set of rules.



308 When Worlds Collide But if you change the set of rules, which is what Georgiev and some others then
did, and adopt a different set o f rules, and apply them in the correct order, this
then produces a result. Once you have analyzed a few such cases to fine a
provisional set o f rules, you choose fresh words and keep trying them, and find
that the rules keep working. The answer, then, is the set of descent rules that will
account for a so-called "Pelasgian," or Prehellenic form; simply a different set of
descent rules from those that yield normal Honeric or Greek forms.
Colin Renfrew: Thank you. May I take one final position? I find this very
illu m in ating, but I’m alw ays a little sk ep tical o f taxonom ical morphological
distinctions which then proceed to inject a concept of chronological priority: I
don’t see where, from the observations you’ve made, we can assign a chronological
priority to one or another set of rules.
Eric P. Hamp: If you assume that P rehellenic came to G reece first with an
Indo-European language and that then Greek came in, borrowed a certain number
o f forms, such as p yrg o s. That is, the locals say "pygos" so we keep on calling
this a p y r g o s . In other respects, the newcom ers bring their G reek, with its
different set o f rules, and settle on top of these earlier people. That is one
assumed train o f events. The other assumption is to say exactly the reverse. You
arrive with a set o f H ellenic rule, and then a group o f Prehellenics come in, and
settle down on top of the Greeks; they borrow from the Greeks, for example,
"polis." If you make the second assumption, you will then discover that you have
no coherent grammar at all; you don’t have a total grammar that will work using
these rules: you cannot conjugate a Homeric verb while using these rules. If you
make this assumption, with an explanation of the descent of twelve or twenty
eight or whatever Homeric words, some of them nouns like agostos, you w ill also
explain ageird, I think. You w ill explain a few forms, but almost every other line
of Homer w ill be opaque to you. If you make the first assumption, however, as we
always have, with a Homeric grammar, for which Brugmann then provided a
background, then these deviant words turn up as small monadnocks, to use a
geological metaphor, in an otherwise Homeric peneplane.
Colin Renfrew: But why are these rules North European and not something else?



Hamp 309
Eric P. Hamp: Because we find our best matches for Prehellenic in that area. The
rules them selves are largely separate from those o f every other branch, just as
those o f C eltic and Germanic are. But we keep finding matches in the forms. Our
best matches are found in Baltic.






THE INVESTIGATION OF PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN HISTORY:
METHODS, PROBLEMS, LIMITATIONS
Stefan Zimmer
Freie Universitat Berlin
For Bernfried Schlerath
on the occasion of his six ty-fifth birthday
I. Methods
The subject of Indo-European Linguistics is languages, viz. those languages found
in antiquity from India to Europe which can be shown to be genetically related
and belonging to one fam ily, the Indo-European language family. Their relation to
each other can only be clarified by historical investigations: therefore the oldest
attested documents of the respective languages are of utmost importance. This also
holds true for the two other parts of Indo-European Studies, viz. Indo-European
Literary and Cultural Studies, on which see further below.
There is one m ethodological principle governing the whole developm ent of
linguistics. It had already been discussed by the Greeks, and received its classical
formulation by de Saussure: it is Tarbitraire du signe". This means that the words
men use in referring to things have no natural connection to these things, but are
ultimately chosen arbitrarily. Only by social conventions do they become general.
It follow s from this principle, which is self-evident to anyone comparing a large
number of languages, that system atic correspondences between grammatical
systems o f different languages are the results o f genetic relations between the



312 When Worlds Collide
languages in question.
In trying to order the information gained by studying the history and mutual
interdependence of genetically related languages and their grammatical systems
and sub-system s, the laws of historical phonology have been established. The
Lautgesetze allow only merging or splitting of a given phoneme under certain
conditions, and nothing else. The method of going backwards from attested
w ord-form s to their unattested pre-form s by using the sound laws is called
reconstruction. Every reconstructed language can therefore have only one
p hon ological system . It follow s from these principles that the w ell-know n
Stammbaum model is the only adequate form of summing up the reconstructed
history o f a language fam ily. It is possible, and often necessary, to reconstruct
(fragm ents o f) unattested languages on various levels: so, we have within the
In d o-E u rop ean lan gu age fam ily not only the reconstructed ancestor,
Proto-Indo-European, but also regional proto-languages between the attested
languages and this ancestor, e.g. Proto-Indo-Iranian, Proto-Germanic, Proto-Celtic,
and so on. The great difference between ’reconstruction’ in history or archaeology
on the one hand and in historical linguistics on the other is that the archaeologist
is able to date the strata in which his finds are located with relative confidence,
and therefore to situate his reconstructed objects in space and time, whereas the
linguist has nothing like a datable stratum: his reconstructions are pure abstracts
incapable o f being located or dated.1 He can only be sure that his reconstructed
forms are older than the attested ones. Furthermore, it is even impossible to
ca lc u la te how much older (the proposed theories o f ’glottoch ron ology’ and
’lex ico sta tistics’ have fa iled to gain any credit); the speed o f change varies
enormously among Indo-European languages (probably within all languges of the
1For sim iliar formulations and more methodological details, see Schlerath 1982, Untermann 1985, W.P. Schmidt 1987,- There has been much discussion on the archaeologists’ absolute chronology vs. the linguists’ relative chronology. To my mind, these terms are less than useful for the present discussion: there have been enough cases of archaeological chronology drastically changed and linguistic chronology reversed to be sceptical about "absolute" and "relative" in this field.



Zimmer 313
world): think e.g. of the Latin verbal categories2 or the Baltic nominal declension.
T h erefo re, the recon stru cted (note the fundam ental d ifferen ce betw een
’reconstructed’ and ’postulated’!) Ursprache cannot be regarded in the same way as
a natural language: no philological interpretation of the reconstructed items is
possible, and any inference drawn from reconstructions (e.g. words for animals and
plants) can never obtain the level of reliability archaeological hypotheses are able
to reach. This is due to the incoherence of the reconstructible vocabulary relevant
to historical questions; therefore, any systematic reconstruction of extralinguistic
features, such as religion, and social structure3, is excluded beforehand. All we can
find are disconnected fragments.4
The first aim of Indo-European linguistics is therefore not the reconstruction of
the Indo-European Ursprache as one of the languages spoken in an unknown
antiquity by unidentified people but as a reference tool in discussing the history
and developm ent of the different Indo-European languages. In other words, it is
not Proto-Indo-European as spoken in a dark past that we want to know, but how
our living languages developed from their common ancestor down to the time of
their earliest attestation. In studying this, we further hope to learn something
about human languages in general, and about the functioning of the human brain
2 The discussion on the prehistory of the A natolian verbal system continues. For its relevance to the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, see e.g. Neu 1985.

B en ven iste can no longer be claim ed for Proto-Indo-European: they are late and regional developments, and not at all Indo-European, as close philological control and linguistic methodology have shown (Zimmer 1987, w ith references).

vis-a-vis the world.
The methodology of Indo-European Cultural Studies is quite different: starting
from the natural assumption that every language - attested or reconstructed - was
spoken by people and that the way of life of these people is reflected by their
language, the reconstructed items o f Proto-Indo-European are taken for specimens
of the postulated Ursprache. This is a further hypothesis, of higher degree and a
priori weaker than all assumptions made in linguistic reconstruction. Nevertheless,
investigations of lost civilizations based on linguistic reconstructions are possible
and legitim ate if, and only if, they are closely controlled by strict methods: these
are, of course, the methods of lin gu istic reconstruction, so that not only
com parable things and institutions are required but also comparable (i.e.
etym ologically related) words for them. The comparison of alleged structures alone
is very weak being dependent on much interpretation; it can never be forcibly
convincing. Further evidence (which can only be linguistic) is necessary to support
the postulated facts of Proto-Indo-European culture.
As far as I can see, only the study of Indo-European literature can adduce the
moment of proof which reconstruction alone is unable to produce. There are two
layers o f literature which may be named ’Indo-European’: one is formed by the
traditional literatures in the different old Indo-European languages and one by the
remains of Proto-Indo-European poetical language as collected first by Adalbert
Kuhn, and in our period in the famous book by R. Schmitt. It has to be kept in
mind, however, that the fragments of common poetical language are representative
only of a very restricted part of society, viz. the richer adult (and perhaps partly
also juvenile) males.5
5 The comparative study of the literature of old Indo-European languages for the purpose of gaining insight into the minds of people living in undocumented periods has received an enormous impetus in recent decades through the works of the late Georges Dumezil (for some of the many objections which could be raised to Dumezil’s "ideologie tripartie", see Zimmer 1978 and Schmitt 1985, both with further references). Unfortunately, older works as e.g. the publications of Burkard Wilhelm Leist (Leist 1884, 1889, 1892) seem widely forgotten today.



Zimmer 315
In the absence o f a specifically historical (as opposed to linguistic) methodology of
its own, Indo-European Cultural Studies therefore rely heavily on neighbouring
sciences, viz. Prehistory, Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology. Any model or
scenario proposed should take into account their respective results and must be
typologically supported by historically attested developments.
Much attention has been paid to the question of the original homeland of the
Proto-Indo-Europeans. Several arguments with names of plants and animals (e.g.
beech and salm on) have been put forward6, but in the final analysis, nothing
decisive remains because the original identity of the the reconstructed meaning of
the reconstructed word and the real object cannot be proven, as Jurgen Untermann
has again underlined recently.7 Furthermore, most archaeologists today have
become very sceptical about the possibilities of identifying a given archaeological
culture with a linguistically reconstructed or historically postulated ethnic group.8
N evertheless, many Indo-Europeanists have made their own proposals about
Proto-Indo-European civilization on the basis of the sources mentioned above.
Every serious description o f this kind is bound to be more a sketch than a
painting and cannot be more than an intelligent guess at the very best. The most
recently published theories may be commented upon briefly.
Marija Gimbutas’ Kurgan theory of Indo-European origins has earned widespread

8 In any even t, it m akes no sense to use the name o f a language to characterize material things, technical products, and methods of work. It should be kept in mind that peoples with close cultural relations or even identical cultures and very similar ethnic components can speak different languages (as English and French, e.g.), and that linguistic unity does not necessarily mean cultural or racial sim ilarity (cf. the Palestinians speaking Arabic like the Arab nomads!). There are p eop les lik e the B ulgarians who are ethnic Turkish, Slavic-speaking, and professing the Greek form of Christianity.

attention in recent years, mostly in the USA. She has conveniently summarized her
own view as follows: "The Indo-European speakers ... introduced hard metal ... for
the production of daggers, flat and sh aft-h ole axes, and [were] fighting on
horse-back with dagger, spear, shield, bow and arrows."(1986, 5). They were
"patriarchal, horse-riding steppe pastoralists", had a "patrilocal and patrilinear
social structure, hillforts and small villages, sem i-subterranean houses, the
domesticated horse and horse-riding, thrusting weapons and hard metal, and a
patriarchal sky-oriented pantheon of gods", whereas the "Old Europeans" (as she
calls the non-Indo-European peoples who are covered by the three Kurgan
migration waves) "were sedentary, matrifocal, peaceful, art-loving, and possessed
of(!) a matriarchal earth- and water-bound pantheon of goddesses". (1980, 1). This
is a very neat contrast, and one wonders what the reasons, for such a clear-cut
d istin ctio n could have been. As a lin gu ist I am cautious of discussing
archaeological facts, and I will only put forward some points of criticism:
a) The use o f ’Indo-European’, i.e. the name o f a language family, is of doubtful
sense if we speak of a period more than two thousand years before the first
attestation of any language belonging to that family.
b) A central point in Professor Gimbutas’ theory, and crucial for the explanation
of the three w aves, is the fighting on horseback. This has been disputed9 by
archaeologists for the Kurgan people, and is excluded for Indo-Europeans before
the first millennium BC, because of the following facts: The horse was well known
by the P roto-Indo-E uropeans, as best proven by several poetic formulas
m entioning the "swift horse", the "horses o f the sun", and using the adjectives
"characterized by good horses" and "having horses which are cared for". The
formulas tell us nothing specific about the use o f horses, but archaeology and
history supply the necessary information.
There are two standard works on the matter: one is Joseph Wiesner, Fahren und
Reiten (Archaeologia Homerica I, F), Gottingen 1968, the other is M.A. Littauer
and J.H. Crouwel, W heeled Vehicles and Ridden Animals in the Ancient Near East

(Handbuch der Orientalistik 7.1.2.B.1), Leiden 1979.101Both agree on the following
facts: Riding for military purposes is an Assyrian invention, first attested in the
9th c. BC. The first Indo-European warriors to appear on horseback were Greeks
in the late 8th c., and shortly afterwards the Achaemenid cavalry.11 Hunting on
horseback occurs slightly earlier, but still in the first millennium BC. Before that
period, horse riding is exceptional, and never occurs in fighting.12
c) The region in which the Kurgan culture has been defined is in the given period
(45 0 0 -2 8 0 0 BC) in no way in advance of other cultures. On the contrary,
archaeologist lik e Xirotiris underline the fact that the region was "spat neolithisiert
und ruckstandig” (1986, 41). It is difficult to see by what means the Kurgan
Proto-Indo-Europeans of Professor Gimbutas could have reached the economic and
military superiority necessary for their ’three mighty waves’.
d) There are no forcibly convincing arguments for the existence of most of the
characterististics ascribed to the ’Old-Europeans’. It is not certain that matriarchy
can been claim ed as a typical non-Indo-European feature. The problem is
com plicated by ethnological theories postulating a regular developm ent of
primitive society through matriarchy to patriarchy. If this is assumed, no early
con tacts betw een patriarchial Proto-Indo-E uropeans and m atriarchial
non-Indo-E uropeans need be suggested in order to explain the fact that
P roto-In d o-E u rop ean society (which was undoubtedly, as w ell as all
Indo-European societies, patriarchal), attributed a special rank to the maternal

11 One could o f course argue that the Proto-Indo-Europeans had forgotten their horse riding by the time they first came into contact with Near Eastern civilizations - but this cannot be a very serious argument: under such restrictions, everything would be possible.
12 It is worth noting that so excellent an Iranian scholar as Mary Boyce h old s (H isto ry o f Z oroastrianism vol. I, 1975, p. 151) that "the horse was domesticated among the Indians and Iranians (probably after 2000 B.C.)".- But cf. Bokonyi 1987.

e) The special use o f the term ’pastoralist’ in the Kurgan theory seems not to take
into account m odern eth n o lo g ica l findings, viz. that pastoralism is not an
interm ediate stage between the hunter-and-gatherer state of civilization and that
o f agriculture, but always a secondary feature in relation to settled and perhaps
even urban p opu lation s.14 P a sto r a lists depend on agricultural products not
produced by themselves.
Recently, another theory has been proposed by Colin Renfrew (1987). According to
his proposal, Anatolia was the Urheimat of the Proto-Indo-Europeans, somewhere
in the 10th to 8th millenium B.C. This scenario is even more unlikely and far from
convincing. His linking of Indo-Europeanization with the spread of agriculture
sounds stran ge enough to the h isto rica l lin g u ist, no really sp ecific

(1985, 22).
15 There are only two words words used in two or more Indo-European languages to designate different kinds o f com , esp. barley and spelt. For none of them, however, can a specific common original meaning be assured. The Greek, Latin, Germanic and Albanian words for barley (Gr Kpt, tcpi8r|, L hordeum, OHG gersta, Alb. driQ, driBz) are independent formations; a common meaning could have been ’awny, pointed’, cf. OE g o rst ’furze’. The Latin word is clearly an adjective in substantival use, and there are ablaut diffences between OHG and OE. The relation of Arm. gari to Georgian keri is unclear, cf. Basque g a ri ’w h ea t’, garagar ’barley’.

and his proposed Anatolian Urheimat is excluded by the unanimous conviction of
Indo-Europeanists.16 His proposed chronology moves still further away from the
first historical attestations o f Indo-Europeans (around 2000 B.C.). Renfrew himself
has to admit that his proposal is nothing other than a "sheer hypothesis"17; this
does not affect, of course, the archaeological parts of his book.
Tamaz G am krelidze and V jaceslav Ivanov, in their monumental study (1984),
propose the Caucasus region (including Azerbaijan) as the original homeland o f the
Proto-Indo-Europeans and explain the ethnogenesis of the different Indo-European
peoples by various migrations. This is not the right place for entering a discussion
o f this important contribution with all its weighty linguistic and historical
arguments which deserve further study. At least in its present form, their theory
implies a number of assumptions which are difficult to accept, e.g. the crossing of
the Caspian Sea by ship, or migrations crossing the Caucasus from South to North.18
Among the multitude o f earlier publications on the subject, Schlerath 1973 is still,
to my mind, the most attractive extant proposal.

II. Problems
A number of important problems have to be brought nearer to solution before
any reliable picture o f Proto-Indo-European history and culture could come into
reach. Many of them can only be adequately dealt with by other sciences, and so,
my following choice is but a specimen of unequally treated subjects.
Anthropology has put forward two important questions in recent years: the
difference between sedentary and pastoralist lifestyle, and the way of emergence
o f a ruling class or e lite . The first is cru cial for the problem of
Indo-Europeanization, and much can be gained by studying the concepts of
colluvies gentium and ’snowball system’ as developed by Muhlmann (cf. Muhlmann
1962, 1964, 1985): pastoralists are basically "sieved out" of existing sedentary
p opulations, and attract perm anently all kinds of uprooted people. ’Snowball
system’ points to the w ell-know n fact that every new adherent to a new structure
(language and/or religion) immediately starts to agitate for its further spread,
winning him self new adherents and causing them to multiply in the same way.19
For the emergence of an elite, Gilman’s ’Mafia hypothesis’ (cf. Gilman 1981, and
his contribution in this volume) seems to offer a path to better understanding of
this complicated process.
19 H istory o ffers a large ch oice o f exam ples for such processes: the "Children o f Israel”, a colluvies gentium composed of Habiru (’robbers’ for ihe Egyptians, o f unknown descent) and different Semitic (perhaps also non-Semitic fam ilies) attracting all kind o f other people during "the forty years in the desert"; the Franks who started their existence as Germanic raiders in Roman Gaul, but attracted growing numbers o f members from all races and languages (this holds true for many other Germanic tribes, too); the Huns of Attila, with their various Germanic components; the Arabization which resulted from the spread of Islam (Mohammad and his first follow ers were only a handful of people, but already 100 years after the prophet’s death, hundreds o f millions o f square kilom eters were ruled by his successors, and millions of people were to change - voluntarily! - their local language for the sacred standard one); the rise of the Mongol empire; the spread o f the Turks (on which see Diakonoff, in this volume). Even the history of the USA could be mentioned here.



Zimmer 321
An im portant item o f m aterial culture, often referred to as typically
Indo-European, is the use of the chariot. One should not overlook the fact,
how ever, that chariots, i.e. "light, fast, tw o-w heeled, usually horse-drawn,
vehicle(s) with spoked wheeles; used for warfare, hunting, racing and ceremonial
purposes" (Littauer-Crouwel, 1979, 4f.) had been invented in the Near East during
the 3rd millennium. In the 2nd millennium, the first Indo-Europeans to learn these
techniques were the H ittites and Aryans coming into contact with Mesopotamian
civilizations. From the same source, the Greeks of the Mycenean epoch adopted
the use o f the chariot in the early 16th c. at the latest (W iesner 1968, 135).
Earlier, Indo-European tribes or the Proto-Indo-Europeans themselves had only
carts and wagons, exclusively for carrying purposes. This agrees exactly with the
results o f linguistic reconstruction. As Edgar Polome has stated (1982, 158), there
is no Indo-European etymon for "riding a horse"; "driving a vehicle" is *uegh, and
there are two words for "wheel", viz. *k~ek~lo- and *ratH~, as w ell as words for
"axle" and "yoke”20, but none for typical riding equipments as e.g. cheek pieces or
bridle.
If we turn to non-m aterial cultural items, the situation is still very dark, and even
if the com parative study o f religions may provide a better understanding of many
points, their relevance for Proto-Indo-European history will always be limited,
due to the fundamental methodological problems explained above. Nevertheless, a
brief survey of some concepts may be useful:
Traces o f totemism, the b elief in an animal ancestor, are found mostly in Western
Europe, cf. such tribal names as Picentes (: picus "woodpecker", also name o f a
m ythical king)21 and H irp in i (: Saminitic hirpus = Latin lupus "wolf") in Italy,
Cherusci (:*herut- "hart, stag") in Germany, and Celtic personal names like Gaulish
20 Cf. further the words for "driving" and "hub". Thieme 1954, 66f. has stressed the antiquity of these items.
21 Cf. Szemerenyi 1971.



322 When Worlds Collide
B ranogenius "born from the raven" and M atugenos "born from the bear", etc.
(though other interpretations of theses names are possible!). There might have been
zoomorphic deities, too (=the totem itself?), cf. the Gaulish Horse Goddess Epona,
the Indian divine Twins Asvinau, the Anglo-Saxon heroes Hengest and H orsa, and
the Greek goddesses Athena and H era who, by their eponyms уАогик-сош^ and
Во-com^ point to their possibly original owlish and bovine nature. A ll this could
result from early contacts, and be regarded as originally non-Indo-European.22
Noteworthy in this context may be the fact that remarkable traces of shamanism,
which is usually combined with totemism, are found in Iran (as recently shown by
Ph. Gignoux)23; elsew here, only sparse elements survive24, e.g. in the story of the
two b illy-goats drawing Thor’s chariot: the god eats their flesh every day, but
avoids breaking any bones. Afterwards, they are brought back to full life again.
The in te r d ic tio n a g a in st b rea k in g bones occurs also in India in the
asvam edha ritual. The figure of Odhinn displays many shamanistic traits, too: his
change of appearance, his mantic practices, his hanging himself etc.2S
The b elief in metempsychosis, known today from India alone in the Indo-European
world, is known from the Greek philosopher Pythagoras and his followers and was
current in Gaul according to the Classical authors who however seem to have
22 There seems to be no trace of totemism in Vedic literature which is a strong argument for the non-Indo-European origin of contingent totemism features in Western Indo-European literatures. Markey 1985 tries to establish a dichotomy o f ’totem and tabu’ vs. ’oath and ordeal’, the first being characteristic for non-IE, the second for IE societies.
23 See Gignoux 1979, 1981, 1984, and cf. further C. Colpe’s interpretation of Avestan a stva t- "physically existing", lit. "bony" (1974-82, 299-300).
24 On traces o f shamanism in Skandinavian literature, see Buchholz 1968 (with references).
25 It sh ould be k ep t in m ind, h o w ev er, that som e sch o la rs regard shamanism as a relative recent developm ent, grown out of contacts between agrarian and hunter societies during the Bronze Age (e.g. Vajda 1959).

misunderstood or overemphasized their sources.26 In India, this belief is not yet
found in the Veda, but emerges later in a vigorous form. It is safe to infer from
that situation that contacts on Indian soil with non-Aryan peoples caused this
d ev elo p m en t.27 On W estern European p eop les and their b eliefs, we have no
information before the first Greek ethnographers. Consequently, we do not know
where and when such creeds were first adopted by Indo-European populations. A
small hint of substratum people and their religions could be given by a possible
trace o f sim iliar concepts in Germanic, cf. the OHG word anchilo "grandson", lit.
"little grandfather". But all this is insufficient for building far-reaching theories
upon it.
Still darker is the case of fertility cults. The type of religion practising vegetation
cults and fertility rites is found all over the world and cannot be regarded as a
special characteristic o f any civilization. Well-known in the history of religions of
Indo-European peoples, it is rather absent in the remains of Proto-Indo-European
poetical language. This may be due to the fact that these remains reflect the life
o f the Proto-Indo-European upper class. The rich are always less concerned with
subsistence than with luxury; furthermore, this poetry is made for and by men, not
women, and vegetation cults are characterized by a prominent number of female
d eities, priestresses and woman worshippers. Of course, the importance of fertility
and vegetation cults grew with the adoption of regular agriculture by the already
separated sedentary Indo-European tribes and was strengthend by foreign
influences (cf. Greek myths).
I do not know if fem ale soothsayers, famous from e.g. Italy (Sibylla), Germany
26 The matter has caused much discussion, see de Vries 1961, 248ff. Roider 1979, 62-78 equates OIrish cophur and OIndian sam sara- as expressing the concept o f "zyklische W iedergeburt”. This is disputed by Droge 1982. Recently, F. Le Roux and Chr.-J. G uyonvarc’h (1986, 271) reject a Celtic b elief in metempsychosis altogether (according to a personal communication from E. Polome - the 1986 ed. of the book cited is not yet available to me).

324 When Worlds Collide
(V eleda) and Greece (P yth ia), belong to the same complex. They may simply
reflect a commonly held and persistent notion o f closer affinities to the irrational
on the side o f the fairer sex.
As far as Greek culture is concerned, it seems unnecessary in general to postulate
early contacts between Proto-Indo-Europeans and non-Indo-Europeans to explain
the low er layer of non-Indo-European religion found there; historical and
archaeological evidence confirm intensive contacts with local pre-G reek
populations and borrowings from non-Indo-European Anatolia during the 2nd
millennium BC on Greek soil, thus explaining the strange aspects of many elements
of classical Greek religion.
A basic question with far-reaching consequences for any assumption in the field of
Indo-European Cultural studies is the concept of Indo-Europeanization.
There are basically two possibilities from which all explanations for the historical
facts o f cultural change (incl. language change) begin: autochthonous evolution or
m ig ra tio n . W h ereas in the la st cen tu ry cu ltu ra l changes, esp ec ia lly in
protohistorical periods, have been understood as effects of massive movements of
large ethnic units (on the model of the historically attested migration of the
Germanic peoples during the transition period between Antiquity and Middle
Ages), archaeology and prehistory today tend more to the evolutionary model. The
truth may safely be supposed to lie in the middle, as ever. One should not forget,
however, that there are undeniable linguistic arguments for migrations28; and the
historical texts from Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome telling of migrations cannot
be all pure fiction. But in fact we do not have precise notions about the nature of
these alleged migrations (cf. the contribution of Igor Diakonoff in this volume),
and we are still in need of more inform ation on historically attested (and
linguistically documented) language change: the study of pidgins and creoles will
28 E.g. O ssetic, today the westermost group o f the Iranian languages, is linguistically an Eastern Iranian dialect, closely related to Pashto, whereas Baloci, spoken in Afghanistan, is Western Iranian and related nearer to Parthian than to Middle Persian (cf. Elfenbein 1974- 82, 492 and 494).



Zimmer 325
no doubt be of utmost importance insofar as we can find there (or not find!)
typological parallels for proposed models of Indo-Europeanization.29
For the time being, the term Indo-Europeanization can be used only as a short
way of referring to the process which led whole ethnic groups to adopt a certain
In do-E u rop ean language (and not civ iliza tio n , religion , or the lik e).
Indo-Europeanization is first and foremost a linguistic i.e. a mental, and therefore
social process. M ilitary operations and changes in economy may have played a
role in preparing Indo-Europeanization, but are in no way a necessary assumption.
In considering the prehistory o f different Indo-European peoples we see a variety
of possibilities.
The H ittite language shows deep marks of non-Indo-European substratum
influences and H ittite religion and literature displays only faint traits of
Indo-European character. There was probably no more than a thin layer of
Indo-European speakers, a superstratum above (or adstratum to) Anatolian
populations who largely managed to retain their own culture. We do not know
who really spoke the different Indo-European languages we are accustomed to
calling Anatolian in and around the Hittite empire, and for how long. Probably,
no more than a very sm all group was involved whose forefathers had once
replaced, perhaps by force, the political and military rulers of Hattusa. We are
less w ell informed on the history of the smaller Indo-European groups in Anatolia,
where similar processes may be supposed. On the whole, the Indo-Europeanization
of Anatolia failed.
The spread of the Aryans is different. Whereas the first attestations of Aryan
elem ents in the Near East are probably the effects of small-scale raids, e.g. the
29 Typology is o f course always secondary to reconstruction (see Dunkel 1982). Gamkrelidze-Ivanov widely neglected this principle.



326 When Worlds Collide
su p p o sed ly Aryan rulers o f the M itanni30, the later history o f Iranian and
Indo-Aryan peoples are that of wanderings and invasions by greater ethnic units
(cf. from the Iranian side, the Mesopotamian historical sources, and the Avesta;
from the Indian side, the Rgveda is our only source for this early period). The
striking difference to the European branches can be explained only by hypotheses
on the period between the separation of Aryan tribes (the future Iranians,
In do-A ryan s, and those called N uristani tribes today) from the other
Indo-Europeans and their first arrivals in their later settlement areas. This is a
dark period whithout any historical sources, and so we have to construct our
hypotheses on typological parallels from better documented periods. We have to
reckon with the effects o f the snowball system (referred to above) having taken
place somewhere between the Urheimat and Middle Asia in the second millennium
or earlier: originally relative small groups of wandering pastoralists gradually
acquired riches and influence, using power in raids (the formula of "driving off
cattle" is well attested) or simply attracting other smaller units by their power
offering security and the possibility o f gaining riches in sharing cattle raids or
other military adventures. After a certain time (impossible to calculate!) they had
become strong and numerous enough to invade Iran or the Indus valley. It seems
that the Persians incorporated with relative ease the people of Elam of which
nothing remained after the fa ll o f the Achaemenid empire. Unlike them, the
Indo-Aryans o f the Rgveda felt a strong difference between themselves and the
inhabitants o f the countries they were to invade. In the Rgveda, no trace of an
incorporation of local population exists. Nevertheless, such incorporation must
have started rather quickly, probably with the adoption of sedentary life and
regular agriculture. Roughly one thousand years later, we see king Nala depicted
as a m odel king, although he and his people were probably31 o f non-A ryan
descent. In theory, class distinctions were nowhere so strong among Indo-European
30 Cf. further the Kassitic word m aryannu- "warriour on chariot", which could be of Indo-Aryan origin (:OI m arya- "young man, warriour"?).

peoples as in India, but in practice32 - at least if we can trust Sanskrit literature33
- the rich and mighty, individuals, families and even whole peoples never had any
serious problems in rearranging that.34
The ethnogenesis of the Greek people and the Indo-Europeanization of Greece is
still a matter for lively discussion. There are scholars like Xirotiris (1986) who
stress the probability o f a purely autochthonous evolution there during the third
and second millennium. According to them, there is no archaeological evidence for
invasion by a foreign population. Others lik e St. H iller (1986) speak of a massive
but short invasion o f a homogenous group o f Indo-Europeans during the Early
Bronze Age, i.e. around 3000 BC, in northern Greece and Macedonia and of later
gradual spread through the rest of Greece. The so-called Dorian invasion is then a
restru ctu rin g o f d iffe r e n t G reek eth n ic elem en ts w ithin an already
Indo-Europeanized country. For linguistic reasons, the Indo-European dialects
forming the Greek language group must have been imported not later than around
2000 BC. For me this contradiction can only be solved by the assumption of small
Indo-European speaking groups intruding upon, not invading, existing civilizations.
The Indo-European intruders, adopting the local cultural elem ents, managed to
gain p o litic a l power. Once holding influential positions their language (serm o
castrensis) became attractive to their retainers and gradually spread through the
whole country. Characteristically enough, Homer mentions "ninety languages" in
32 Cf. Rau 1957, 62ff. und Mylius 1972, 335f.
33 Cf. kings o f Brahmanic descent as well as army-leading Brahmans in the two epics, and Sudras as kings in the classical literature.
34 W hoever, as ruler o f a tribe, pays for the appropriate ritual thus accepting the cast system can reach by ritual at least the status of a K$atriya, and as an artisan, merchant or farmer that of a Sudra. There are examples for such processes even from recent history (cf. the dynasties of the Mahrattas). The founder o f the dynasties o f the Sumgas (2nd с. B.C.), Kanvas (1st c. B.C.) and Kadambas (4th c. A.D., South India) were all Brahmans. And where do all the conservative Brahmanic fam ilies in South India come from? - Thanks to Harry Falk, Freiburg, for helpful references.



328 When Worlds Collide
Crete (x 174f.), and writers o f the Classical age mention villages in Attica still
speaking non-Greek, i.e. probably non-Indo-European, languages.
Further arguments for the validity of the snowball system model are presented by
the history o f the C eltic languages. Whereas the main Continental Celtic language,
Gaulish, keeps rather close to the traditional type of old Indo-European, the
Insular Celtic languages show traces o f heavy influence by other, probably
n on-Indo-E uropean, languages.35 Their literature, however, displays a striking
fid elity to Indo-European customs and manners. The Indo-Europeanization o f the
British isles was therefore, after all probability, the work of a rather small but
very influential group.
III. Limitations: the example of mythology
I have been asked by the editors to consider possible evidence for early contacts
of Indo-European populations with non Indo-European ones in the field of
m ythology. Therefore, mythological items will be used in the following as an
example to show the intrinsic limitations of any study of Proto-Indo-European
history.
In India, all possibly non-Aryan mythical and religious material most probably
stem from contacts of the invading Indo-Aryans with local populations. These
contacts cannot be dated earlier than c. 1500 BC, and have therefore nothing to do
w ith the period discussed here. It should be m entioned, however, that the
Indra-Vrtra-myth has earlier been interpreted as a reflex of historical combats
between Aryans and the local populations. Comparative Religion sees it nowadays
rather as a cosm ogonial myth comparable to the separation of earth and water in
other mythologies.
The Iranian m ythology is fraught with many sp ecial problems: Zarathustra’s
35 See recently Wagner 1987 (with references).



Zimmer 329
teach in gs r e fle c t, apart from his personal religiou s exp eriences, purely
Indo-Iranian, i.e. Aryan concepts, and everything that may be regarded as of
non-Indo-European origin, like e.g. the Anahita cult, the funeral rites, the custom
o f incestuous marriages in noble families (attested for the royal families of Elam36
), and the rich m y th o lo g ica l m aterial found in M iddle Persian sources
(Bundahishn), appear only later: they might have been taken over at any time
from non Indo-Europeans who had always lived among and between the different
Iranian tribes. These contacts are therefore difficult, not to say impossible, to date.
As all other Indo-European peoples with the exception of Hittites and Greeks
emerge considerably later, all theories which argue using material coming from
their respective mythologies only must be rather weak. The mythology of the
H ittites (and the other minor Indo-European peoples in Anatolia, if anything is
left from them at all) seems to be non-Indo-European throughout.37
G reek m ythology o ffers many m ythological item s clearly borrowed from
autochthonous non-Indo-European or non-Greek Near Eastern sources. The date of
the earliest borrowings is unknown, but there are no arguments for assuming any
such contacts before the 3rd millennium.
C la ssicists38 are co n v in ced that the cosm ogonical schem e underlying Greek
m ythology was taken over from Oriental neighbours. But none of the Greek
theogonies can be derived directly from a foreign one, without assuming genuine
36 And elsewhere, e.g. Egypt.
37 E. Neu’s interpretation o f the Anitta text stating an "enge Verbindung zwischen hethitischem Konigtum und altindogermanischer Religion" (1974, 131) and speaking o f "alte Bindungen der Hethiter an die hochste G ottheit des idg. Pantheons" (ibid.) overemphasizes the scanty remains, viz. that *dieu s is still the name o f a god, not yet (as later in hitt. sius) the appelative for "god". Already for A n itta (around 1800 B.C .), the ven eration of im ages - an a b so lu tely non-Indo-European practice - was nothing strange (see line 11 of the same text).

Greek transformations. Here, some characteristic points will be briefly indicated.
The divine genealogy O keanos-U ranos-K ronos-Zeus corresponds to the same
fourfold succession in the H ittite (earlier Hurrian, partly still older, perhaps
containing Sumerian elements) Kumarbi Epic (succession Alalu-Anu-Kumarbi-wea
ther g o d ) and the P h o en icia n myth as given by P h ilon o f B yblos
(H ypsistos-E pigeios-E los-D em aros). Because of the close correspondence in many
details (e.g. Uranos’ castration by his son, Kronos’ swallowing of his offspring, the
parts played by fem inine deities), a common origin of the myth must be assumed:
for chronological reasons, this source cannot be Greek.
A widespread cosm ogonical concept is the separation of heaven and earth by a
violent act as contained in Hesiod’s stories of Uranos and Gaia. The same myth is
w ell known from Sumer and Egypt, it was even found in recent times among the
Maori people.
Som etim es connected with the separation of heaven and earth, but also
independent o f that myth, is the concept o f a primordial egg out of which the
world was shaped. The Greeks probably took over this picture from some Near
Eastern sources, but it can also be found elsewhere, e.g. in Aryan tradition39 and
the Finnish Kalevala.
The tale o f the great flood as reflected in the Greek story of Deukalion and
Pyrrha clearly resembles the B iblical deluge and the flood of the Gilgamesh Epic.
It goes back to real submersions in Mesopotamia as archaeological evidence shows.
But the story is also found elesewhere, even in America.
The m otive o f a primordial combat between a god or demiourgos and a monster
underlies (in different contexts and versions) the stories of Typhon and Python. It
has often been compared to the stone monster of the Hittite Ullikummi song. It
probably also underlies (at least partly) the dragon-killing stories found all over
39 As established by Karl Hoffmann (1957).

the world.40 The serpent Ladon guarding the Hesperides’ golden apples strongly
resembles the serpent o f Paradise in the Bible; it may be another aspect of the
complex.
The veneration o f sacred stones as explained by Hesiod’s version o f the founding
of the sanctuary at Pytho = Delphi (Zeus sets up the stone once swallowed by
Kronos in place o f his child Zeus) closely resembles Old Testament stories and the
pre-Islam ic rite o f venerating a meteor stone in Мекка taken over by Mohammad.
The b elief in supernatural powers embodied in stones is o f course found in other
parts of the world, too, and nothing specifically Near Eastern or Indo-European.
Similar to the veneration of sacred stones is the worshipping of trees, found not
only in Greece, but also among many other Indo-European peoples. The custom is
probably genuinely Indo-European, and possibly elementary human.41
The various stories o f Zeus’ marital unions with a large number of goddesses have
been interpreted as reflecting the incorporation of local cults (perhaps fertility
cults?) into the religious system o f the newcomers. This is a sensible view, but
difficult to prove.
The idea o f the creation of the human race out of divine blood is hidden in the
Greek story o f the giants and nymphs sprung from Uranos’ blood, and is
paralleled by the Babylonian myth (Enuma Elish) where mankind stems from the
blood of Kingu, the adverse god king.
At this point, I would like to finish this rather impressionistic list. Innumerable
books have been written on the subject. As in every dispute of interpretation,
reliab le results and objective criteria are difficult to agree on. H istorical
linguistics, which is a far more solid field , has shown that Greek religion, for the
most part, is not of Indo-European origin: most gods have non-Indo-European
names or at least names without acceptable Indo-European etymology.
40 See now Watkins 1987.
41 Many facts have been listed by J. W. Taylor (1979). According to his remark on Arm enian p. 126, he is, how ever, a com plete foreigner to Indo-European Studies.



332 When Worlds Collide
Uranos: Greek form ation, perhaps "rainer" (:OI v a rs -); but not
related to OI Varuna-\
Kronos: without etym ology, the meaning "old man", occurring only
in nam es, is based on the m ythology or on popular
etymology (: xpovo?).42
Zeus: inherited as name o f the god of "bright daylight sky", = OI
D y a u s (p ita ), Hitt, siu s "god", L d iu s "day" (in n u diu s
tertius "the day before yesterday").
Hera: w ith ou t convincing etym ology (hardly "goddess o f the
year”), probably pre-Greek < non-Indo-European.
Athene: unexplained, pre-Greek < non-Indo-European.
Aphrodite: o f unknown origin , pre-G reek, non-Indo-European; the
name may be altered by Greek popular etymology.
Hermes: o f disputed origin; pre-Greek according to Schwyzer and
Chantraine.
Apollon: w i t h o u t a c c e p t a b l e e t y m o l o g y , p r o b a b l y o f
(n o n -In d o -E u ro p ean ?) A natolian orig in , cf. L ydian
PXdans, Luwian Apulunas, Hitt, h ap-pa-li-u -n a-as.
Artemis: no convincing etymology known ("bear goddess" ??); Lydian
forms Artimus, Artimuh, Artimu-k.
Dionysos: perhaps a Thracian name "son (?) o f Zeus”; but in fact
without etymology.
Poseidon: from an older (or perhaps even wrongly archaized?) name
form noieiSaFcov, meaning "Lord (husband) of the Earth"43
42 It has been understood also as a Pelasgian (i.e a non-Greek, but IE language spoken once in Greece or the nothern Balkans) form corresponding to Greek yepcov.
43 The name is quite problem atic. Possible Pelasgian origin cannot be excluded (cf. Demeter below). His classical function as a god of water is probably secondary, and due to Zeus’ growing to overlord of the whole pantheon.According to Wagner 1981, 23, the name Poseidon is "itself a translation of the Sumerian E n -K i, ’the Lord o f the Earth’", and he finds the same in *Dumnonos, the hypothetical name of the ancestor-deity of the Celtic D um nonii. I see,



o f unclear stem form ation , probably b elongin g to

Proto-Indo-European!
w ithout etym ology, pre-G reek , probably
non-Indo-European.
Indo-European "Mother Earth", though the details of the
first member of the compound are not clear. A probable
parallel is found in the name of the Messapic goddess
damatura.
So, only two o f the fifteen names o f the main Greek gods can safely be said
to have been inherited: "(Father) Sky" and "Mother Earth”, four or five may be
Greek (or at least pre-G reek Indo-European) formations, the rest are of unknown
origin, i.e. probably non-Indo-European. This should be enough to ensure intensive
early contacts between the forefathers of our Classical Greeks and other, probably
non-Indo-European peoples.
Some Germanic m ythological themes should be presented here, too, as
promised in my abstract. Germanic m ythology is best known from late, viz.
Scandinavian sources dating from the High Middle Ages. But there are earlier
testim onies by the Classical writers, especially Caesar and Tacitus, church
historians lik e Paulus Diaconus and Adam of Breme, the runic inscriptions from
the 4th c. on, and some tiny remainders of pagan thinking hidden in Old English
and Old German literatures. A ll these various sources provide us with rather
consistant inform ation about Germanic religion and mythology. The most
prom inent theme in Germanic m ythology which could perhaps reflect early
contacts between Indo-Europeans and non-Indo-Europeans is the war between the
two divine fam ilies, the Ases and the Vanes. It has often been understood as a
reflex of the conflict between an invading(?) people of warlike spirit, venerating
Asic deities, and a sedentary people living from agriculture and husbandry. The

however, no possibility of substantiating any genetical connexion between such striking resemblences.



334 When Worlds Collide
compromise between the two divine families would then symbolize the fusion of
the two ethnic components. Attractive as this interpretation seems at first glance,
it overlooks the fact that Caesar’s and Tacitus’ Germans still live a semi-nomadic
life, but already venerate the typical Vanic deity Nerthus. Middle Age Scandinavia
is extrem ely warlike (the Vikings!) and at the same time completely agricultural. It
was the same Icelandic farmers and cattle-breeders who venerated the Asic war
god Thorr and the Vanic fertility god Freyr. Furthermore, the A ses-V anes
dichotomy cannot be compared with the struggle between Devas and Asuras in
Indian m ythology. Germanic *ansuz is a term on whose linguistic background
unanimity has not been reached.44There can be no close connection to the Indian
44 The etym ological iden tity o f *an suz (G oto-L atin a n s is ’sem id eos’, Jordanes 76,13; Old Norse ass, OE OSax os "Ase, god") with the appellative noun "beam" (Gothic anza DatSg, Old Norse ass, etc.) was first claimed by J. Grimm (D eutsche M ythologie I3 22), whereas the connection with Old Indian a su ra -, Avestan ahura- was first suggested by Guntert (1923, 102). Polome (1953, 38) proposed the inclusion o f Hitt, h a s-, h assu - "to beget" and "king" in the same fam iliy. Oettinger (1976, 24 note 8) reconstructs an IE *h2onsu- "lord" as foreform o f Hitt, hassu-, Av. ahu- "lord" and Germanic *ansuz. Polome is more specific in describing the meaning of IE *H 2nsu-(ro~) as "controller of vital energy" (letter, 16.12.87). This, however, would fit much more the Germanic Vanes than their Asic opponents (even if members of both divine families can distribute "vital energy" in the Eddie literature o f M iddle A ge Scandinavia).- Cf. further Feist 1939, 52-3, M ayrhofer 1956-76, I 65 and III 637, Schlerath 1968, 142-153, and again M ayrhofer 1987,148. - The old theory (with "beam") is still worth considering because o f the archaeologically attested veneration of so-called pile idols (many examples found in swamps), see R. Meringer 1919, 107-123.



Zimmer J -3;)
Asuras because these deities are not inherited from Proto-Indo-European but, as
proven by their Iranian counterparts, only Aryan developments out of abstract
moral concepts (Varuna "true word", M itra "covenant", A ryam an "hospitality") as
A ntoine M eillet and Paul Thieme45 have shown in many publications.46 Other
divine disputes in the mythology of Indo-European peoples mostly reflect
generation conflicts within a cosmogonic model such as the Uranos-Kronos-Zeus
complex mentioned above.
Among other G erm anic concepts that have been suspected of being of
non-Indo-European origin are the creation o f the world out o f parts of the body
o f a first gigantic being (Ym ir), or that o f the creation of mankind out of trees
(A sk and Embla)', the concept of a world column47 (Old Saxon irminsul)\ and the
rich m ythological m aterial on various kinds o f giants48 and dw arfs or other
supernatural but not divine beings. It is rather unlikely that these should be seen
as traces o f an older, non-Indo-European population. Similiar mythologemes are
found elsewhere within Indo-European, esp. in Old Indian.
On the other hand, the Irish mythical history as related in the Lebor Gabala or in
the traditions about the Battles of Moytura is generally understood to contain
vestiges o f earlier populations. But here, as well as in Germany, nothing is certain,
no real evidence can be found 49 A typical Celtic m ythological motif is the kettle
45 Fundamental is Thieme 1938.
46 On a different view , see Brereton 1981 and my review o f this book
(Zimmer 1986).
47 Found also in Finnish and Hungarian mythology.
48 Cf. the recent collections by Motz 1984 and 1987 (with references).
49 W agner 1981 argues for strong substratum influences to be seen in
C eltic religion , and points to possible similarities in Germanic and Greek of
equally non-IE origin.



336 When Worlds Collide
o f rebirth. If the Gundestrup cauldron were to be correctly placed in connection
with this theme, it would be attested for Continental C eltic, too. It recalls
Sham anistic p ractices, and is probably another argum ent for a strong
non-Indo-European substratum in Western Europe.
The custom o f head-hunting and of guarding the slaughtered heads as trophies is
known from Gaulish sanctuaries (e.g. La Roquepertuse), from Caesar’s writings and
from Old Irish saga texts. I see no possibility of forming any hypothesis on the
where and when of this custom’s origin.
One cannot be cautious, and even skeptical enough in comparing mythological
data. There is a nice example from a MHG lyric poet: Heinrich von MeiBen,
called Frauenlob, at the beginning of his Frauenleich ch. 11, makes Mary utter the
fo llo w in g words: d e r sm it itz O berlande w a rf sinert hamer in mine schoz,
ob viou sly m eaning "God has made me pregnant". Since the 19th century, this
passage was seen as a remnant of pagan ideas, and has been compared with the
use of Thor’s hammer as an instrument o f fertility, and with various Germanic
designations o f "heaven" as "land above".50 But closer inspection of this allegedly
evident case o f mythological continuity has shown that Frauenlob could not have
had the slightest idea o f Eddie poetry, and that in fact all possible sources of his
image were based on ideas o f theology and natural philosophy of the Christian
M iddle Ages which in their turn go back to the Classical tradition (Krayer I960,
124-174). How many item s in our mythological handbooks would turn out as
equally accidental pseudo-parallels if only we had enough material to analyze
them sufficiently?
IV. Conclusion
There is no such thing as a Common- or Proto-Indo-European mythology, and
so See Fritzner 1896, I 715, with references to the older literature.

what we know about Proto-Indo-European culture is but a scanty bit of rather
incoherent information unsufficent to allow a reconstruction of the whole. Among
them are many item s which cou ld stem from early contacts of the
Proto-Indo-Europeans with non-Indo-European peoples, but there is no way to
control such assumptions, or even to prove them. We should not ask the wrong
questions, but interpret our material within the frame of the probable and sensible.
Progress is seldom achieved by proudly putting foreward bold theories which are,
in the end, no more than risky hypotheses. What we need is epistem ological
modesty.
Even in what is their proper theme, viz. explaining in a pre-scientific manner the
riddles o f existence by telling histories about gods and other superhuman beings
and their relation to the world and to mankind, myths are never clear and explicit
enough for the standards set by modern scientific thinking. How can we expect,
then, that it would be possible to gain historical (in the modern sense o f the
word!) inform ation from them, being bits of traditional lore transmitted and
variated over and over again for thousands of years? Let us take them for what
they are: fascinating religious and literary documents, but surely not records of
Stone Age history!
For the tim e being, I can only offer the following summary of the results of
Indo-European comparative grammar research on the problematics of Ursprache
Urvolk - Urheimat:
1. Phonological reconstruction of preforms common to genetically related
languages is only possible by using the sound law methodology which
implies the Stammbaum model.
2. M orphological reconstruction yields only fragments o f grammatical
systems and subsytems.
3. L exical reconstruction yields only disparate and incoherent (bundles
of) items which cannot be situated in space and time.
4. N o unequivocal interpretation o f the reconstructed word and its
reconstructed meaning in regard to physical reality is possible.
5. Any deduction from the reconstructed vocabulary to the physical
world of the postulated Urvolk is bound to remain purely hypothetical.
6. T he o n ly r e lia b le source for Proto-In do-E u rop ean thought, the



338 When Worlds Collide
fragments of common poetical language, is representative of a very
restricted part o f society only, viz. the richer adult (and perhaps
partly also juvenile) males.
7. Characteristics o f this Proto-Indo-European ruling class society (if it
could be so called) are the system of mutual hospitality, and the
ethical value o f truth.
Further research is needed: Ethnology may gain further insight into the
typology o f prim itive and ancient societies and then be able to say whether the
results of comparative linguistics are specific enough to be called Indo-European
or not.
Prehistory w ill further clear the archaeological concepts of migration vs. local
development and the methodology of their possible evidence.
Indo-European Studies (which I can only see as a branch of Comparative
Grammar) w ill continue to reconstruct details on every level, and to present, from
time to time, hypotheses summing up all these details in a possible picture of
Proto-Indo-European, its speakers and their way of life.
Let us hope that one day someone w ill be able to present a model acceptable
to all parties interested in this fascinating question.51

GIFT, PAYMENT AND REWARD REVISITED
T.L. Markey
For the Indo-European speech community, the institution of gift/exchange, its socio-economic implications and, of course, the vocabulary to express this phenomenon have all been repeatedly investigated.^ The roster of investigators includes some of the most distinguished forces in the fields of historical linguistics and anthropology, but of all contingents, perhaps the French is the most distinguished. To single out but a few of the more prominent and, for our purposes here, pertinent names, we recall Antoine Meillet’s (1907) pioneering functional definition of Mitra; the very general Essai sur le don (1925) by Marcel Mauss, the intellectual forebear of Claude Levi-Strauss; Emile Benveniste’s Don et ichange dans le vocabulaire indo-europeen (1951), subsequently expanded and refined in that scholar’s Le vocabulaire des institutions indo-europeennes (1969:1.17-202); and the classic mitra Varuna (1940,2nd ed. 1947) by Georges Dumezil, which that father of the triadic theory of Indo-European social, economic, and power structures fittingly dedicated to Marcel Mauss and Marcel Granet. Despite these and numerous other perceptive and engaging inquiries, not even the well-trodden ground of the Germanic sector, much less that of Northern Europe, specifically the Northwest Block covered by Celtic, Germanic, and Balto-Slavic (or Baltic and Slavic), has been exhausted. This northern block, particularly its western, insular fringes, was presumably one of the last areas of Europe to have been settled by Indo-Europeans. It is also an area in which there must have been prolonged and intimate contact between Indo-Europeans and their non-Indo-European precursors,



346 When Worlds Collide
prominently the megalithic builders of the third millennium. T his was the setting for a dash between what were apparently quite divergent cultures. To assume that, say, the builders of Stonehenge were catatonic primitives and that their successors had no interaction with the Indo-Europeans who survived them defies derision. Whereas creolistics has continually searched for lingual substrata, it has becom e a disciplinary prejudice on the part of Indo-Europeanists not to seek substrata. It is on these western fringes of Indo-European settlement that the Celtic and Germanic peoples forged cultures that shared much, a give and take that is reflected in the reciprocities of their institutional lexicons, even in the dictions of their later epics, transcended as they are from a common heritage.^ Here, we shall concentrate on the evolution of both inherited and secondarily developed Germanic terms for the semantics of gift/exchange. After having articulated an evolutive hypothesis, we shall first review an early set of terms related by the force of indebtednesses in premonetary conditions of communitas and, subsequently, see how these structures were reshuffled, semantically recast, or even replaced within monetary economy conditioned by indebtednesses circumscribed by payment/reward. A s Leach (1982:152-75) has diagrammatically contended, it is debt that innervates, prolongs, and expands the networking of what social anthropologists term both restricted and generalized exchange. The state and nature o f debt and the shifting patterns of social relationships and power structures that debt orchestrates in manipulating gift/exchange on the one hand and payment/reward on the other hand supply thematic focus for the discussion that follows. From the available evidence, comparatists long ago inferred that "commercial" vocabulary of an early Common Germanic must have been severely limited and that this department of lexicon was later fleshed out (1) externally by borrowing and/or (2) internally by phylum-specific morphosemantactic shifts and other redeployments just prior to and for some time after the emergence of the Germanic peoples in recorded history. This observation as hypothesis can now be restated as an evolutive claim: as a speech and a cultural community Germanic was comparatively later than its neighbors, particularly those to the south, in moving from a primitive, inherited form of gift/exchange to vastly more complicated system of payment/reward. In its initial records, Germanic appears far more archaic than its neighbors and more nearly reflects the anterior stages of Indo-European. Germanic clearly lacked analogues of Latin expressions such as fenus, UsUra, merces, soliitio, all o f which evidence econom ic notions that are well advanced beyond a gift/exchange communio, or the state of affairs that is recorded for the Germani by Classical observers and/or compilators even a century after contact: mos est civitatibus ultro ac viritim conferre principbus vel armentorum vel frugum, quod pro honore acceptum etiam necessitatibus subvenit. gaudent praecipue finitimarum genitium donis, quae non m odo a singulis, sed et publice mittuntur, electi equi, magnifica arma, phalaerae torquesque; iam et pecuniam accipere docuimus. (Tacitus, Germania Ch. 15). The three principal sources for Germanic "commercial" terms are: (I) . Latin/Rom ance, an enduring loan source, provided English with, for example, bargain, interest, salary, pay, etc., but the chain o f lending is often lengthy, sometimes indirect, and not every link is altogether clear. N ote bargain < AngloNorman bargaine < LLat. *barcane-um to LLat. Barcani-are (Capit. Charles the Bald). (II) . Celtic, which, for example, supplied uniquely Gothic dulgis (OIr. dliged, W died, dyled), giving rise to the phrase dulgis skulan, thereby narrowing the



Markey 347
scope of a particular application of skulan (otherwise passively neutral as skuld ist ’it is necessary*), see Feist (1939:128-9), Benveniste (1969:1.199-1) and note OSC dliigfi < Goth, dulgs (attested only in the genitive dtilgis): Germanic (Gothic) supplied much of the "commercial" lexicon of Slavic. and (III). Other (quite possibly pre-Indo-Europeari)donors. In this category we find Goth, shafts, Germ. Schatz, etc., the one Pan- and Proto-Germanic form of minted coin, presumably silver. It may well be that skatts, from whatever misty source, originally signified ’cattle’ and only later came to mean m oney/coin, just Vieh —> Geld under the influence of Lat. pecunia. Here, too, is silver, found only in Germanic, Baltic, and Slavic (e.g. OPr. siraplis, OCS srebro), albeit in varying shapes, all of which are dialectic-specific caiques on some ultimately common source. W hereas Germ, (etc.) kaufen is most plausibly explained as having been formed to Lat. caupo, Engl, buy (< O E byc3(e)an), Goth, bugjan, OS buggian, OIc. byggja (’to purchase a woman) lacks a plausible etymology. Whether High German (Frankish, Alemannian, Bavarian) had a congener is unknown and unknowable. Recourse to Engl, big, which is known only from the end or the 13th century in Northumbria and north Lincolnshire (byge, bygg(e), bigge) and which points to a *bhugh-yo- is no solution, as this form is also opaque. Examples of phylum-internal adaptive changes are the wholesale shift of *saljan as (give, sell) in North Germanic and Ingwaeonic and replacement by verkaufen in the south. Even in later Old English, sellan (syllan), which is well known for the phonological problems it poses, marginally had the m odem denotations, but not epically (e.g. in Beowulf), e.g. the Old English Gospels (John 12.5): Hwi ne sealde heo pas sealfe wip prim hundred репеЗоп, a significance that is generalized in the course of the 13th century at the total expense of the original ‘give’ value. OE costian ‘try, prove, taste’, cf Germ, kosten, link of necessity (e.g. needes coste ’necessarily’, so Chaucer and contemporaries) in the course of the 14th century. A highly aesthetic exercise that provides much insight into early Germanic notions of gift/exchange and its motivation by necessary debt is the comparatively late Icelandic Dattr AU&unar Vestfirzka (Moridnskinna, c. 1200, Codex Gamble kg. Sami. 1009 foL, c. 1275; also copied in Flateyjaibok), popularized by its inclusion in E.V. Gordon’s An Introduction to Old Norse (the edition cited here for convenience). This story must have been widely circulated and certainly survived by its distinct charm, but the fact of the matter is, carefully controlled stylistically as it is, this j>attr is virtually a parabolic extension of the gift/exchange ethics specified by Havamal proper (St. 39-46), that is, in the core of this Eddie poem that probably represents its most authentic extent. This fa ttr relates the "commercial" adventures of Authun, an Icelander of modest means who first set aside enough provisions for his mother and then went to Greenland, where he gave all that he had earned to buy ( =kaupa) a polar bear, a great treasure ( =gprsimi mikla, and thus characterized throughout the tale). H e intends to give the bear to King Sveinn of Denmark. H e first goes to Norway and visits King Harald, who offers to buy the bear for (1) what Authun had paid for it and, when refused, (2) for twice what he had paid for it and, when he refused, (3) asks if he might receive it as a gift, which Authun also refuses. Authun is then permitted to do what he wants, namely, to leave and give the bear to King Sveinn of Denmark. D espite the state of war between the two countries, King Harald permits Authun to leave and asks only that Authun, who may well be "a lucky man" ( =gaefu-mabr), visit him on his return. At



348 When Worlds Collide
the Danish court, Authun, now destitute (ok er f>a uppi hverr penningr florins), first m eets the King’s steward, Aki, who refuses to provide food for Authun or his bear unless he has sold (= selja) a half interest in the bear, which Authun does. Upon m eeting King Sveinn, Authun tells how he had fared with King Harald, how he had intended to give Sveinn the bear, which, thanks to Aki, he now only owns half of. King Sveinn banishes Aki, and Authun remains at court. H e tires o f that, and then goes on a pilgrimage to Rome, whence he returns destitute to King Sveinn. H e then wants to return to Iceland. Sveinn says that Authun may be "a lucky man" (=giptu-mabr) and prepares the gift of a fully provisioned boat for him to do so. Authun informs King Sveinn that he will visit King Harald. In Norway, King Harald questions how King Sveinn had rewarded Authun for his gift, and Authun replies: (1) he accepted the bear, (2) paid for his pilgrimage, (3) made him his cup-bearer, (4) gave him a ship with provisions, (5) a satchel of silver, and (6) a ring with the prescription that he only part with it when he had found a man worthy (noble) of such a reward (...,nema ek aetta nqkkumm tignum manni sva gott at launa, at ek vilda gefa.). Harald says he would have ceased with item (4), the ship, feeling that sufficient payment for the bear. Authun thereupon gives the ring to Harald, for Harald had chosen the nobler alternative: he had let Authun go when he could have killed him and taken the bear. Authun then parts from Harald, who "gafAubuni im o ti gobar gjafir." Authun then leaves for Iceland in the summer, and was ever after considered the luckiest of men (= inn mesti gaejumabr).
Clearly, commercialism fares badly here: Authun will not stoop to it with Harald, and Aki who does with Authun is banished. Giving, particularly of patents royal (the ring), is the highest honor: here, gift/exchange is far preferable to payment/reward. Yet, the focal gift/treasure/reward of the bear is a little ridiculous, though the custom of such gifts persists among heads of state even today. What we have in this comparatively late text is a re-contextualized remembrance of the gift/exchange ritual between comitatus and a prince, the scene reviewed by Tacitus in the Germania as quoted above. There is, however, a play on words: the giving Authun is termed lucky = gacfu-/giptu-mabr lit. ‘gift-man’, i.e. fortunate he who gives, precisely as the pertinent stanzas in the Havamal tell us. Reward is expressed by launa v., cf. Germ. Lohn, OE lean from lau-na-, cf. Lat. Lu-crum, OIr. log, Idach. But the real reward is the bear, characterized as a "treasure" = gorsimi. The contrasted court scenes, first in Norway, then in Denmark, and finally in Norway once again, are obviously framing devices central to both the tale’s progression and its message: fortunate (lucky) he who gives, which is left to the reader to infer. But the giving is strategic. Significantly, these frames stage host (donor/receiver) and guest (donor/receiver) reciprocities, the relations of exchange and the personification of hospitality, that is, a social equality temporarily formed by mutual compensations, the setting of Mitra: a personification of social contract. These courtly frames have their origins in a specific Indo-European cultural context, namely, the rite ofphilo-xe(i)nos ‘having (making) the stranger (guest) one’s own by temporary annexation.’ The bear as treasure is an honorific charge, the symbol of contract by exchange that implies obligations in return, at once both gift/reward and source of indebtedness. Hospitality, as this frattr clearly shows, is something sacred and is not to be confused with or tainted by mere commercialism.
The term for ‘treasure’ = gtprsimi (gersimi, gprsemi, gtprsime, etc.) is obviously a late, entirely secondary, and uniquely North Germanic creation. This



Markey
compound was originally an in-stem (fem .), and it is conserved as such in the singular, but the plural has analogically gone over to the о-stems. The initial component is gQr(r), the unusual past participle (= a pure adjective ‘ready, done, made, beweaponed’) of gtpra/gera ’ to do, make’, while the second component derives from *s5mi > -soeme > -seme > -simi (-simi), cf. OIc. sim-la ‘always, ever’, see Noreen (1970:Arts. 82, Anm 3; 149) and, on the formation o f m-stems, see Brugmann (1906:317-8). Cf., further, ODa. gprsum, M dnlc.. gersimi. The word is exceptional in several ways ON in-stem s regularly lack plurals, even those that are analogically derived (or might be analogically derivable). The initial component contains a well known crux: NGmc. is unique among Gmc. dialects in displaying gera/gpra/gjpra (etc.) for ‘to do, make’ (elsewhere, with the exception of Gothic, we have tun and machen, as well as reflexes of a *tow, e.g. runic tawido ’made’, which lacks extra-Gmc. analogues). A reconstructible Norse input for gera/gfra = *garwjan lacks a credible etymology: postulation of an underlying *gh(w)orw-yo- leads to nothing plausible. This is seemingly yet another pre-Indo-European constituent of dialectal Germanic. The second component is transparently from som i < *sam, a well pedigreed term for ‘honor, appropriateness, appropriate (to/for), becoming’, etc., see Lindow (1975:135-43) for an admirable survey of the cultural staging of this term. This noun turned qualifying suffix supplied Engl, -some, functionally equivalent to Germ. -bar. The original semantics of gorsimi were probably something like ‘doable, fitting, suitable thing’, but its life outside North Germanic was highly restricted: OE gersuma > M E gersume is patently a Norse loan, one of many that did not survive to becom e incorporated into a later, post AngloNorman, standard. The significant observation here is that North Germanic was apparently forced to innovate to supply a term for ‘treasure’ in the context o f the courtly gift/exchange ritual. The term that regularly filled this slot (the environment for treasure as reward conferred by princes on members o f the comitatus, or, conversely, by members of the comitatus on princes, cf. the citation from the Germania above) is ultimately derivable from a *moi-t-mo: Goth, maifrm-s (lx Mark 7.11 = Gk.6<Lpov Vlg. donum, Engl, given, OS methom masc. e-stem , OE таЬ(Ь)ит masc. а-stem , both with anaptyctic vowel, OIc. meibmar fem. о-stem , pi. only. This lexem e is unattested in Old, Middle, or Modern High German, nor is it attested in any period of Frisian, where *mathe/mithe (or the like) might well have coalesced with mede (nude), also methe/mithe ’reward, rent* = Germ. Miete, and the possibility o f such homophonous coalescence is also conceivable for High German, cf. the forceful separation of the two words in Old Saxon: mebmo te medu (H el. 4482). Cf. OHG meta (besides later mieta, miata), which was replaced by Zins< Lat. census beginning in the 7th century. Luther’s Miete, mieten, Mietling were unknown to his Upper German contemporaries. On Miete (e tc .) ‘rent, reward’ = Goth mizdo, see infra. , Although artificially revived in the modern period, OIc. meibmar, found only in the plural, is sparsely attested. It is never found in prose, nor in skaldic poetry, and is actually attested but seven times in what are generally considered younger poems o f the Eddie canon: ftrymskvioa (23.1), Sigubarkviba in skamma (2.2), Atlakvi&a in groenlenzca (5.5), Atlam&l in groenlenzco (95.2), Rigsfrula (38.5), HlqSskvi&a (Hunnenschlachtlied) (11.3, 33.3). O f the seven occurrences, five (J>rk. 23.1, Sg. 2.2, A m . 95.2, Hunn. 11.3, 33.3) are the collocation fitglS meioma ‘much, a great store of treasure’, which has exact parallels in Beowulf (madma fela 36, cf. madma maenigo 41, manegum mabmum 2103, madma menigeo 2143) and the Heliand (ml&mo filu 3292),



350 When Worlds Collide
storar meihmar (Akv. 5.5) is required by alliteration (storar mei&mar oc stabi Danf>ar), but also has the appearance of a fixed phrase. The remaining occurrence is a problematic line: meibmar oc mqsma, тага svangrifia (R b. 38.5), where mqsma should be restored to mqsmar, the obvious difficilior reading for this masculine plural, a hapax that has remained etymologically opaque, though the line is usually translated as: ‘treasures and jewels (treasures) and slim-flanked steeds’. Alliterative collocation of ‘treasures’ and ‘steeds’ is a stock item in Beowulf and has every appearance as such of being archaic: Beo. = mearum ond madmum 1048, 1898; meara ond madmum 2166; that is, in three out of a total of thirty-one occurrences of the simplex in the poem. Further indication of the fixed, frozen phrase nature of mei&mar is the fact that Hunn. 33.33 is a repetition of Hunn. 11.3: fe oc fiqlb mevSma, sem mic fremst tfSir, and note that meiomar is contrasted w ith /e as a different sort of wealth/treasure. Cf. Beowulf 470-472, where Hrothgar explains that the wergild he had paid for Beowulf’s father’s slaying of H eatholaf had consisted of both,feoh and таЬит:
sukban f>afaeh&e feoj>ingode sende ic Wylfingum ofer waeteres hyrcg ealde madmas; he me aj>as swor.
and madmas thus forms part of a contractual agreement (signalled by ajias). In both Beowulf and the Heliand, mabum/methom is frequently qualified as ‘brave, bold, expensive, dear’: Hel. = diurie methmos 1198, 1845, 3286, 4578; diurrero methmo 5889 (i.e. five out of a total of twelve occurrences in the poem); Beo. = deorum madme 1528, dSore madmas 2236, dyre m sbm as 3131, cf. m afm e j>y weorjjra 1902. This is additional evidence that what we are dealing with here was a stock item of epic composition, the sort of information Snorri later inventoried, an item the well-trained scop had to know. Even compounds are stock items, cf. methomhord (Hel. 1643, 1676, 3261, 3772) and hordmadum (Beo. 1198, lx ), cf. maoma hord (Beo. 2799, 3011). This term did not simply specify ‘gift’, for otherwise compounds such as methomgebo (Hel. 1200) would be tautologies. Nor was this simply ‘treasure, jewels’, as the word is traditionally and misleadingly glossed; otherwise we would not find definitional collocations such as тёЬто gestriuni (Hel. 1721). This is gift/exchange, originally in ritualistic contexts, even as wergild and commemoration (e.g. mabbum td gemyndum Beo. 3016), as well as ‘reward’, e.g. теЬто te medu (H el. 4482). The semantics of methom/mBoum could even express heirlooms, comparable, in North American terms, to giving medicine bundles at a potlach, cf. ealde madmas (Beo. 472) and synonymous аёг-geslreon (Beo. 1757, where it references madmas in the previous line, and again in 2232). W e may now summarize the dialectal and chronological distribution of *maif>m-. It is as we noted, attested but once in Gothic, where ‘reward (treasure)/paym ent/gift’ is otherwise glossed by fra-gifts, giba, mizdo, laun. A s we noted, too, it is not found in Frisian or High German, nor, for that matter, it is found in (Old Low) Franconian. In Continental Germanic, it is restricted to Ingwaeonic. In Old Saxon, it occurs only in the Heliand (12x = 1198, 1470, 1721, 1845, 1848, 3192, 3286, 3292, 4482, 4487, 4578, 5889, and methomhord, the only compound with this term, occurs four times = 1643,1676, 3261,3772) and Genesis (1 x 171), but never as a gloss, nor in any of the later, minor texts, e.g. the Freckenhorster Heberolle (neither K, now lost, nor M), which, as they are generally commercial in scope, might be expected to contain this word had it developed and survived with a decidedly commercial sense. In addition to the Gnomic Verses, Metres o f Boethius, and Alfred’s Pastoral Care, Anglo



Markey 351
Saxon attests maipm- frequently and, as we have seen, revealingly in Beowulf (31x - 36, 41,169, 385,472,1027,1048,1052,1482,1528,1756,1784,1860,1867,1898,1902, 2055, 2103, 2143, 2146, 2166, 2236, 2490, 2640, 2779, 2788, 2799, 2865, 3011, 3016, 3131, as w ell as in compounds: dryht- 2843, gold- 2414, hord- 1198, ofer- 2993, sine- 2193, wundur- 2173). In Beowulf, it remains semantically distinct from its demi-competitors: gift f., lac nt., ge-streon nt., sine nt., fraetwa, -e f.. Nevertheless, given frequent definitional collocations with these demi competitors and compounds, which, if not equipollently composed, are non-tautological, one is left with the impression that maipm- was hardly anywhere in active use by the 9th century, but was reserved for the composition of epics or isolated as a cultural artifact. This assumption is, as we have seen, definitely borne out by Icelandic which attests the word a mere seven times and only in younger portions of the Edda. However, it seem s entirely incorrect to assume, as Mohr (1939: 193) did, that Icelandic borrowed the term from a common stock of W est Germanic literary filigrees. If so then the borrowing must have occurred well prior to Ingwaeonic (the only W est Germanic area that attests the word) monophthongization of Gmc. al, that is w ell before the Anglo-Saxon Landnahme. Otherwise, we would expect *таЬтаг (or the like). Mohr’s judgments, like those of his near-contemporary, Hans Kuhn, were prejudiced by an era that wished to see Continental Germanic as the cultural heartland. This word represents a Pan-Germanic inheritance with clear roots in the protolanguage. In this, it differs from its demicompetitors: sine, of unknown origin, is found only in Old Saxon and Old English; as a noun, OE 15c (which survives in wed-lock) was restricted to Anglo-Saxon; OE fraetwa, e is a dialect-specific nominalization built on *(fra)-twa-jan to *tow- ‘do, make’, cf. Goth, usfratwjan, OS fratahon (another incident of Ingwaeonic -w— g-/-h -), see Feist (1939:531); OE ge-streon is elsewhere reflected only in OS, OHG gi-striuni, none of which survive into the Medieval period. It seem s altogether clear that an inherited Gmc. *maipm- was the term par excellence of gift/exchange (treasure, reward, payment) in the setting o f the communitas and a word from the lexicon of pre-Christian epic recitation, the ‘reward/treasure’ circumscribed by social contracts in a primitive economy in which value was determined by social standing rather than the inherent worth of an object, cf. Dum ezil (1947:79-83,118-24,152-9). In short, *maipm- is the Germanic answer to the notions personified as *Mitra in Indo-Iranian. Association of *maipm- with the communitas concept is assured by its collocation with *gamaini = OLat. (acc.) co-moin-em, cf. Germ. Meineid: OE mdpma gemdenra (Beo. 1784), mapmas gemaene (Beo. 1860), cf. Mdn. Engl, ‘a man of means’. In the wake of the socio-economic revolutions that attended the introduction of Christianity, *maipm was displaced, albeit at different rates and at different times from dialect to dialect: it was regarded the term for ‘reward’ in a decidedly non-Christian setting. The one Gothic occurrence supports this assumption. It is uniquely employed in Mark 7.11 to gloss Jcaurban = corban, a rendering of the Hebrew term that underlies this approximation for ‘offering, oblation’, cf. Leviticus 2.1; Jehovah rebukes all who adopt this device (offering, obligation = corban = maipm-) to escape the necessity of supporting their parents, cf. Benveniste (1969:1.91), who overlooked this contextual saliency. Wulfila had the advantage of a native pagan term, while both Greek (=6dip ov here) and Latin { = donum here) translators lacked his bicultural/bilingual perspective. Within the "new" Christian tradition, what had formerly been the favored term was transformed into a pejorative: *maipm- was ostensified as the false reward, the pleasure



352 When Worlds Collide
of the unbelievers. But, then too, as Benveniste (1969:1.167-8) astutely shows, mizdd, ultimately related to тафт-, referenced wordly reward, while laun (cf. launa-wargs, sigis-laun) denoted providential or heavenly reward: in Gothic, тафт- was displaced by laun, see the collocations in Matthew 6.1-2. Similarly, note the progressive displacement of Germanic terms for ‘temple, cult site’, see Markey (1972). Note, too, that Lat. lucmm, originally ‘providential reward’, later acquired a pejorative stigma, not only within (Ibero-) Romance, but also upon entering English (e.g. the frozen phrase filthy lucre), cf. ME lukir, lukre, etc., so at least as early as W yclifs (ca. 1380) worldy honour and lucre. In the Heliand, methom usually denotes worldly treasure, reward and is periodically equated with odwelo ‘wealth’, but the transition is not com plete. In Genesis (171) it refers to heavenly reward: meomo so mildi. N ote, too, in a confusing and much discussed line, тйрЬит for Metode (Beo. 169), perhaps ‘Grendel ought not approach God’s throne, the treasure/reward’, cf. Philippson (1929:184). The dyadic, binary opposition between laun (heavenly/true reward) and mizdo (false/earthly reward) as an articulation of the contrast between sacred and secular, divine and profane respectively, that Benveniste (1969:1.167-9) so admirably succeeded in eliciting from Wulfila’s text was, we firmly suspect, guided by a well established structuralist principle. This is, of course, the principle o f complementarity, the very basis of any hierarchical dialectic, a principle that asserts that the reality of an item’s existence or position (often construed as coterminous) is defined by the oppositions it erects. This is the sort of thinking that has long directed the bulk of modern social anthropological inquiry, so Leach (182:221-4). It is certainly the common argumentative thread that underlies the investigations o f two o f Benveniste’s most distinguished and influential colleagues, namely, Claude Levi-Strauss and Georges Dumezil. N ote, for example, how Dumezil (1947:76) asserts that, in the first instance, the concept of the brahmana was defined by its opposition to ksatriya. Indeed, the process of lexical bifurcation, particularly for notions that are obviously institutional in scope, in effecting repartitions between the secular and the divine is a hallmark feature of Indo-European, and a structuralism which embraces complementarity principles has been highly successful in uncovering the conceptual patterns and their interleafing that lie at the core of early Indo-European acculturation. N ote, for example, in the realm of the sacred, the opposition between Goth, hails (secular) and weihs (divine), or in the law, Lat. jus (secular) vs. fas (divine), see Markey (1985b:278). Now, if, as seems highly likely, laun originally defined providential, divine reward/treasure in opposition to mizdo (and congeners) as the expression of secular reward/treasure, payment gained by contest, conquest, or work, then where does тафт- fit into this continuum and what, if any was its relationship to laun on the one hand and or its formal sibling, mizdo, on the other hand? then, too, in addition to the exigencies of a conversion literature as outlined above, why did тафт- vanish? Why, too on its deathbed in that literature, was it so readily ambiguous (both secular and divine) and unable to make a transition to one pole (laun) or the other (mizdd)? W e suggest that, as the original expression for courtly gift/exchange within the communitas, тафт- occupied a pivotal position midway between totally {+secular/-divine} and totally {-secular/+ divine}, indeed just as the princeps as communal leader (Goth fcudans) and addressee of the /ия/р/я-ritual occupied the same position:
laun тафт mizdo + divine c| divine -divine



Markey 353
-secular erf secular + secular Nevertheless, maipm- was still the highest earthly reward so long as no divine reward was distinctly crystallized, as it was in Christian tradition. Yet, тафтremained closer to mizdo, as both were essentially earthly as opposed to laun, and could, even formally as we shall see, be confused with mizdo. A s an intermediary, as a betwixt and between area of liminality, an interface between two categories, тафтdefmed a position o f danger, the typical locus of ritual activity. Authun could be rewarded by King Harald or King Sveinn or he could forfeit his life. In the shared feelings generated by participatory gift/exchange communitas, however, the social differences between individuals could be forgotten, as are the social differences between Chaucer’s pilgrims en route to Canterbury, see Leach (1982:158). This is the locus of the Christmas gift/exchange ritual, the modern analogue of heathen тафт-. D ue to its interstitial, Janus-like midway position, тафт- becam e ambiguous (both secular and divine), as we have seen in the early conversion literature. However, as Christianity emphasized the polarities of the continuum at the expense of the middle, тафт- becam e increasingly cloudy, increasingly in need of definitional collocations, particularly so as the institution that required it weakened, and it finally vanished altogether. Its lingering effects alone conjured forth new creations such as gtprsimi, or plugged such new creations into the contextual slot тафт- had once occupied. On the other hand, as mizdo —s> Miete, with a narrowing o f semanic scope (the specific reward of ‘rent, interest’), or, as was the case with related OE m ed f. > Mdn. Engl, meed (archaic), lost its foregrounding and became increasingly vague, this member was phased out of the continuum, thereupon leaving Lohn/l0nn (the case with M odem German, Dutch and Scandinavian) to cover both poles of the continuum. For laun (= OE ISan), English was somehow compelled to borrow Norse lan > Engl, loan, which was assigned a specifically commercial sense of ‘reward’, cf. Miete. Deprived of a laun, as well as an effective mizdd, English borrowed Anglo-Norman/Northern French (re)warder = Mdn. French regarder, in turn a Germanic loan to French (viz. some dialectal ancestor of Germ- warten, cf. erwarten) to cover both poles and additionally borrowed the source ofpay (see supra) for distinctly secular rewards. With reference to more modern (e.g. King James, etc.), as well as the Greek Vulgate, translations of the collocations in Matthew 6.1-2, we can establish the following polar members of the continuum:3 LAUN MIZDO
Gk. p ia 3 o v P ia 3 o v Vulg. mercedem mercedem Germ. Lohn Lohn Dano-Nw. 10Ш 1 10ПП Eng). reward reward With the elimination of a definitional contrast in the post-Christian period, what had been a ‘reward’-continuum in earlier Germanic collapsed to a unitary set. In operational terms, the anisomorphism that had once obtained between Germanic and Greco-Roman cultural norms in this denotational field was removed; the semantic space of laun was extended to cover mizdo, precisely the converse o f the Greek situation. Subsequently, laun was necessarily affixally qualified in particular contexts, e.g. Germ. be-lohnen/Be-lolmung.
A Gmc. *тафт- unambiguously points to an underlying *moi-t-mo > prePGmc. *moitm-, that is, a deverbative ( <*mei-, see Pokorny 1959:715) nominal

derivation in *-tmo, a secondary compound suffix which began with the addition of -mo to originally vowel-final verbal roots extended with -/- (not -to-), cf. OHG bradam < *bhre-t-m6 and OE beorma ’leaven, yeast’< *bher-mo-, so Krahe-Meid (1967:125-6). H ere, one may recall the following analogues of t-extensions: Goth, maidjandans (lx II Corinthians 2.17), ga-maij>s, OIc. meiba: Lat. mUtuus, miit-are, miituor, mutuum (dd) < *moit-, cf. commoetacula (Festus 56.29) < *com-moita-clom; Gk. (Sicilian loan from Italic) poI tos ‘thanks, favor’; OHG muzzon < Lat. mut-are (indirectly). The incidence of such t-extensions is generally restricted to western dialects, not only Germanic and Italic as just indicated, but also Baltic and Slavic. Cf., for example, the following derivations from an underlying *meitu- (or the like ) in Baltic and Slavic: latv.. mietus ’exchange, change’, mietuot ’to exchange, mitet ’change’ (refl. ’to cease, stop’), mit ’to exchange’, pamisu adv. ’alternatively’; OSC mite adv. ’alternately’, Bulg. na-mito adv. ’across, slanting*, Pol. dial, m itus/m itus/ ’crosswise’, cf. OSC misti, mistiti v., Bulg.miisti, Russ, mesti, C z.pom sta, -mstiti v., Pol. mscic v. ’revenge/avenge’. The relationship between an underlying participial adj. *mit-to- >mitsto- > Gmc. (Goth.) missa- (cf. Engl, mis-) and the Old Irish negative prefix mis(s)- (e.g. miss-imbert ’ foul play, he abused them’) is contested, perhaps a reformation of mi- (e.g. in mi-imbert ’ deceit’, cf. mi-fn-imret ’that they deceive him’), see Thurneysen (1966:Art. 365.2), who equates mi- with the prohibitive negative = G k.yn, Arm. mi, Skt. та, etc., suggests that this negator had become a compositional prefix, and points out that there is no by-form mis- in Old Irish. Otherwise, the /-extension is seemingly found only in Indo-Iranian. N ote Skt. Г mith ‘alternate, altercate’, e.g. mithati (R -V ), methati; mitha adv. ‘shifting, mutual, together’ = Av. m iee adv. ‘falsified’; Skt. mithus, mithus, mithuya adv. ‘wrongly, falsely5, mithya adv. ‘in vain’ <*mithiya, where semantic isolation of adverbials became more complete after loss of their corresponding noun. Skt. mith-u, adv. ‘alternately5: mithuna- ‘forming a pair, copulation’ = Av. miewana, are in reality abstracts in -wan formed to a radical enlarged with -/-, so Benveniste (1935:115-6). Note, too, the corresponding vrdhhi adj. mailhuna ‘being coupled, characterized by coupling, connected by marriage’. M ost plausibly also here is Mitra- from a common Indo Iranian *mitra-, besides younger, specifically Indie mitra- ‘friend’ (masc.), ‘friendship’ (R-V nt.) ‘the prince whose territory adjoins that of an immediate neighbor is called "a friend"’; vrddhi maitra ‘belonging to Mitra’, maitr-eya adj. ‘benevolent’, maitri fem. ‘goodwill, intimate association, perhaps also Ir. (YaSt. 19.29) fra-mita-, see Mayrhofer (1963:633-6) s.v. Mitra)}, minati. It seems doubtful whether Hitt, mutai- ‘avoid, remove, distance oneself from’ is related. Another prominent suffixation of *me/oi- is with -no/-ne- (ni-). Cf. OIr. mom {main, maen) fem. (-stem ‘gift, treasure, reward’, dag-moini, maenech ‘rich’ (moenech MS Rawlinson B505 fasc., p. 165a, 12th cent.), moenigfid (MS Harley 5280, fol. 44b-48a), all from *moi-ni- vs. British Celtic *mei-no-, e.g. W mwyn ’worth, value’, see Vendryes (1960:M69-60). Note, further, Lat. miinia, miinus < *moi-ne/o-s\ Gmc. *ga-maini- (e.g. OE gemaene) + OLat. (acc.) co-moin-em, cf. supra; Lith. mainas, Latv.. mains ‘exchange’; OSC m ina ‘change, exchange’. Suffixation of *me/oi- with -no-/-ne- is a general characteristic of W estern Indo-European (Germanic, Italic, Celtic, Baltic, and Slavic), but is also found in IndoIranian, albeit in forms with the semantics of ‘revenge, vengeance, punishment’, the negative, pejorative side of gift/exchange, cf. the vertauscht ■>verfalscht connotation of related OHG mein, Germ. Meineid. Cf. Skt. maxi- fem. ‘revenge’, Av. maeni- fem. ‘punishment’. O f course, suffixation with -no-/-ne- is relatively recent in Indo

European; it is ignored by H ittite. It is o f interest to note that, with the exception of Celtic, the dialectal distribution patterns of t-extension and sufGxation with -no-/-necoincide: Germanic, Italic, Baltic, Slavic, and Indo-Iranian. Before proceeding further, we must underscore the facts that тафт- is an exclusively Germanic innovation which must stem from pre-dialectal stages o f Common Germanic. A canonical shape anticipated for Indo-European would have been *moimo-, see Hamp (1982-1983). The arresting and insufficiently stressed observation is that Norse lacks an analogue to both exclusively WGmc. *med- (> *тсю-) and a *mizdo-, though it attests what we have presumed to be a native reflex of *тафт-, namely, mei&mar, albeith, as we have noted, but feebly attested and defective, as it occurs only in the plural. Having canvassed the Germanic evidence for тафт- and noted, particularly, its co-occurrence with *ga-maini-, especially in the Beowulf epic as a cultural context for gift/exchange and the detritus of the original wording o f that ritual process, we now seem justified in reconstructing a specific figura etymologica for Pregermanic, namely, *moitmos gho-moinis ’(dutifully, communally) given gift/exchange’, which corresponds (however approximately) to a Common Italic *donom da-/dowhich Euler (1982) has retraced. W e thus have the remnant o f an о-grade nomen actionis in *-mo- qualified by a participial adjective in a ready-made surface structure formula that is simultaneously a thematic synthesis of a highly prized feature of early North European culture, presumably on a par in its significance with other such sets retrievable from Ind-European Dichtersprache und Dichtkunst, e.g. the celebrated /srava(s) aksitam uncovered by the venerable Adalbert Kuhn, *wekwos wekw-, *wesu klewos, *deiwos nmrtos.
OE m ed fem. о-stem ‘m eed/M iete’ (OS meda, OHG meta (miata, mieta with "breaking"), OFr. m ede/m ide/m eide, Langobardian meta uniquely glossed ’bride price’ (Edictum Rothari, Leges Liutprandi)) could speculatively be derived from *meidh- (see infra) and thus relatable to maipm- and distinct from Goth, mizdo, OE meord, so W ood (1899:261-2), who however, posited a Pre-Gmc. *meita-. If we accept *mei-, then we can mechanically project a Theme I *твал-у-, however tentative. Now, as every comparatist knows, the precise nature of the relationship between a WGmc. med- an what underlines Goth, mizdo, OE meord (primarily Mercian alone and but feebly attested, this fem. о-stem occurs only in Bede’s Historia ecclesiastica and St. Gregory’s Dialogf) has long remained a moot question. W e may begin by providing a survey of the reflexes o f an underlying *mizdho- ‘reward, wage’ (as a convenient form with which to operate, so Pokorny 1959:746). This etymon is distinctly eastern in orientation. Both italic and Celtic lack analogues. In Germanic, only Goth, mizdo and OE meord point to a *mizdho-. It is totally lacking in Armenian, which, in fact, fails to show any traces of a *me/oi- (or the like), or any derivatives of the putative Wortsippe in question (personal communication from John C. Greppin). Gk. moeos ‘wages, pay*, from Homeric to Modern Greek, is well integrated in the lexicon: phtos ‘fixed wages’, м ю бц' ‘for hire’, б ч с о о п к о в ‘daily wages of a dicast or juror’, cf. тобою ‘I give or receive a wage, pay* with a present in ow, and thus with the appearance of a factative made to complete the conjugation of a passive. CF. тобо? 3rdsg., moeoT 3rd sg. subj.,mo9ouv < *m oeoeiv. umeois the only Greek reflex o f this Wortsippe. This etymon is widely attested in Slavic, from which it is borrowed Wortsippe.

(~placa), Bulg. muzda, Cz mzda, Upper Sorb, m zda/zda, Russ. mzda. This is yet another segment o f the lexicon of a Balkan lingua franca. The word is also prevalent in Indo-Iranian: Av. mizda- nt. (e.g. YaSna 62.6), Osset, m izd/m yzd, Mdn. Pers. muzd, Skt. nudha- nt. ‘reward, contest, battle, prize’ (in collocations with rana, yuddha) < *mizdhd- < *mizdho- < *mis-dh-o-, parallel to nida- < *ni-zd-o- ’nest’, and note identical development of gd > d. In Sanskrit it is restricted to vedic; it does not survive in the Classical period. Interestingly enough, this also holds for related miyedha- (Av. myazda-) ‘sacrificial offering*, cf. infra, midha- occurs but four times in the Rgveda; 1.100.11, 6.46.4, 9.106.12, 9.107.11, and the last two occurrences are in an identical formula = ...milhd saptir na vajayuh. It consistently appears as milha-, that is, with Ih for dh in the extant recensions, and this may indicate that the word was already considered a non-standard (eastern) dialectal variant by the time of early codification (Panini does not subscribe to lh /l and refers to Vedic usages such as sadha, ida), see Deshpande (1979:226-8). N ote the related perfect active participle midhvans (said to be from Гnib) in the weak forms mTdhuse -mflhuse ‘richly bestowing (gifts), bountiful’. The distributional evidence alone points to a later, secondary, albeit immediately dialectal origin for *misdho: Germanic, Slavic (but not Baltic), Greek (but not Armenian, and this is the only form in Greek that contains *me/oi-), and IndoIranian. Composition is perplexing. Specht (1947:249-50) correctly noted that -sdh- is not a legitimate Indo-European suffix, but then continued with the unfounded suggestion that what we ultimately have her is a collapsed phrase: *mis dhe- ’was als Austausch dagegen gesetzt wird’ with *mis < *me/oi- as in Skt. mayate, etc. A participial origin ( <*midzdho-) was compellingly discounted by Brugmann (1930:1.626, Anm. 1). An effective way to proceed is to segment *misdho- as mis-dh-o- and then to review the primordial value o f suffixal -dh- in terms of Benveniste’s (1935:188-210) cogent presentation. With reference to Benveniste (loc. cit), the affix -dh-, originally with restricted incidence in pre-dialectal Indo-European, became utilized in a particular dialectal range: Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Indo-Iranian, and, particularly extensively, Greek (north European IE ?). From its primordial deployment as a radical enlargement (affix without alternating shapes), -dh- was extended as a suffix ( affix with alternating shapes: -dh-//-dho-), particularly in the verbal system. This affix primarily signified "state, especially an acheived, accomplished state," and was readily coupled with roots with a neutral or instransitive value, a significance that was re-enforced by addition of -dh-, which also evolved as a sign of the middle, even desinentially in the 1st and 2nd persons plural. Secondarily suffixed elem ents are regularly joined to zero-grade roots, an assumption that provides a basic *mis-dh-o- as a point of departure (Indo-Iranian, Greek, Slavic, Germanic— northern IE?). A basic *mis- is itself necessarily construed as an enlarged form of a radical *me/oi-{I. mei-C- : II. my-eC- ), that is, *maiy‘exchange, trade, gift’, and thence ‘common g ift/ exchange,’ see Pokorny (1959:710, 713-15). Postulation of *me/o i- and perception of -s-, -t-, and -gw- as elementary enlargements of this radical to which suffixes (-dh-j-dho-, -ne-/-no-, -m -/-m o-) were optionally added permit relationship of an otherwise seemingly disparate set of highly archaic terms for ‘gift/exchange’:
mei-gw-(G k. amoibos) mei-t-(-tu-) (e.g. Latv. mietus) m e/o (i)s- —> mis-dho-'



Markey 357
mos-mo- (ON *mqsmr sg., mgsmar pi. a dialect-specific hybrid of uncertain origin, possibly contaminated with mosurr and the like, an Entgleisungsform pieced together from m o(i) - / /m o(i)s-m o-//m o(i)-t-m o~, see Johannesson (1956:677). moi-t-lmoi-t-mo- (Gmc *тафт-) moi-ne/ o - (e.g. Lat. m m us)
Regular association o f -s- with e-grade radicals isolates OIc. *mgsmr(masc. sg.) as an Entgleisungsform, but both contextual semantics and reconstructible shape point to a relationship within this Wortsippe. Hamp (personal communication and in various versions furnished me of his study of OHG sezzal and related matters intended for the Moulton Festschrift) convincingly argues for the following development of *misdho-'m Germanic: *misdho*mizdo- —►(feminized thematic denominal formation requiring guna e-grade vocalism)*meizdd->meizd->me(i)zd->mird- where the latter two shapes provide the sources of attested early reflexes e.g. OE meord vs. m ed resp., cf. Sievers (1894:409), Janko (1906-1907:255), where Janko anticipates Hamp’s derivation with his m<Tdo- < me(z)do-< me(i)zda-.
The archaic deployment of congeners in the m e/ o i ‘gift/exchange’ group in portions of the Indo-European speech (as opposed to language) community has been detailed above. A firm presence of the group in northern Indo-European, what we may term the apple/plow /p ig /-sector (see Markey 1989), is particularly noteworthy, as is the adduced formulaic collocation: m&itmos gho-moinis ‘dutifully, communally given gift/exchange,’ specifically reconstructible for pre-Germanic, which may well have had far wider dialectal and geographical currency, perhaps throughout northern IndoEuropean and the pre-non-Indo-European community o f the so-called "applecontinuum." A moitmos (or the like) may well have been a tribute extracted by a forceful minority operating within a d efied feudalism in northern Atlantic Europe, an area which may now view as integrating non-resident Indo-European with a resident non-Indo-European settlement, a composite grouping, see the contributions by Hamp, Gilman, and Zimmer in this volume, Polome’s references to non-Indo-European in this volume, and Markey’s (1989:592) account of ritualized grain tributes. Having uncovered fragments of a prehistoric gift/exchange process, the archaeologist should seek coordination within the artifactual record, and here we refer to studies such as those compiled by Champion and Megaw (1985). A t this particular point in our research, we should be asking essentially interdisciplinary questions: is the delineation of possible prehistoric tythe barns coterminous with the presumed distribution of a *moitmos (or the like) and some associated ritual? Preliminary investigation suggests—at least from the fragmentary linguistic evidence recovered to date for non-Indo-European in northern Atlantic Europe that, at the end of the megalithic period, this area witnessed extensive acculturation among indigenous, non-Indo-European groups and Indo-European or Indo-Europeanied groups. A s indicated by some retrievable social nomenclature (e.g. the magus/mawi problem, see Hamp in this volume, and *skalk, caiques in Engl, marshall (‘horse servant?’); certain limited lexical categories such as terms for Crustacea, fish, fishing, and seafaring/boats; the practice of totem /tabu as a non-IE expression vs. oath/ordeal



358 When Worlds Collide
as an IE institution; the indication of tythes or tributes as gift/exchange in a clefted feudalism defined by socio-ethnic origins; distinctly non-IE terms for flora and fauna; non-IE agricultural forms and cultivars (pig/plow/apple)', certain culturally tagged semantic pairings (tim e and weather as synonomous for non-IE, e.g. tempus, vs. differentiated in Indo-European); emerging bits and pieces o f the onomastic puzzle (e.g. non-IE dial. *mal- ‘stone’ vs. non-IE dial. *&er-‘stone’); culturally significant vocabulary that is institutional in scope, but inconceivably Indo-European (e.g. *bhughas a basis for ‘to buy*), we are finally beginning to realize a socio-econom ic situation for the association of indigenous groups in northern Europe, a situation that stands in vivid contrast to a romanticized vision of an intrusively nomadic, uniquely patriarchal and belligerent, Indo-European onslaught such as that captioned by Maria Gimbutas, see her contribution to this volume. By linguistically sifting non-Indo-European from IndoEuropean (e.g. all those fo-ful forms in northern Europe), we are beginning to see the roots of accommodation by apposite groups on the threshold of recorded history.

NOTES
(1) O f course, I assume all responsibility for the interpretive efforts that follow, but I would here like to thank my many colleagues who have influenced me in thinking about these lexical matters over the past decade, especially Eric P. Hamp and Edgar C. Polom e, but also, at Michigan, Garry W. Davis, who, while still a graduate student accompanied me on numerous fieldtrips to the Sauk and Fox of the M ississippi in Iowa and participated in many discussions about this topic and related anthropological matters.
(2) Comparatists have long recognized the possibility of non-IE elem ents in the Northwest Block, e.g. the shape that underlies North European (Germanic, Celtic, Balto-Slavic) ‘apple’, and etymologically difficult forms that underlie ‘plow*, certain terms for ‘pig’, and so on. In a paper presented to The Seventh International Congress of Celtic Studies (Oxford, July 10-15,1983), we attempted to indicate signs of the prior, substratal existence of a distinctly non-IE totem/tabu culture in the Block, as well as the complementarity between oath/ordeal (= IE ) and totem/tabu (= non-IE) cultures and their contents, spelled out in Markey (1985a), the nucleus of which Claude Levi-Strauss (per litteras) greeted with approval.
(3) See Elston (1934) and recall Arbois de Jubainville’s (e.g. 1891) now discredited thesis of Celtic overlordship. As examples of key institutional etyma shared by the two groups, note OS nimid (lx ) = OIr. nemed ‘sacred grove’, Goth. Ища f. ‘marriage’ = OIr. luge (luige) nt. < *lugyom ‘oat (in contracts)’, GMc. *аф- = OIr. oeth < *oito-. With respect to the lexicon of contractual agreement, such an intimate association as that evidenced by Celtic and Germanic is perhaps found nowhere else in IndoEuropean. Terms considered archaic, exclusively literary, items of restricted distribution in the older Germanic dialects are sometimes the norm in Celtic. Such is the case with O E folm (e) f., OHG folma f. ‘hand’ (vs. hand, Hand resp., of course, in the modern period) and their Celtic (OIr. lam, W llaw) congeners < *plHa-ma, so Hamp (1982-1983:175), who sees Lat. palma as the syncope product of a *palama. Further examples could be cited in legion.
(4) According to the OED, ‘reward’ in its present sense dates from c. 1320: That to 3ow byth rewarded.... Initial and non-final intervocalic Gmc. w (or, better, Franconain w) regularly evolved as g in French, e.g. wis- > guise, want- > gant, wahta > gaite, *werra > guerre. In Norman and Northern French, however, w lingered for some time, and even in the medieval period it occurred as an approximate in Norman, so guarder, guardez in the 13th century Anglo-Norman Oniatus mulierum.5
(5) What we have obviously attempted here is a diachronic mapping (by comparing synchronous states) of the internal structure of a lexical sub-system covering the conceptual field of ‘reward’. This is a procedure well known from its application by Jost Trier (1934) to chart replacement of MHG list by wizzen and the disappearance of courtly and social connotations from the kunst-wizzen duality, see Lyons (1963:37-50) for a discussion and critique.

INDO-EUROPEENS ET PRE-INDO-EUROPEENS
DANS LA PENINSULEIBERIQUE
F. Ш аг
Entre la fin du second et le debut du premier millenaire a.C. commence pour la Peninsule Iberique la Protohistoire. A propos de ces premieres siecles nous n’avons que des nouvelles sporadiques sur la fondation de Gadir, les fabuleuses richesses du Sud, le commerce de l’etain, la route des voyages atlantiques... Malgre l’existence d’un systeme local d’ecriture et d’une relative abondance de textes ecrits dans les langues peninsulaires, la pleine entre dans l’histoire n’aura lieu qu’au moment ou les interets des grandes puissances mediterraneennes entrent en collision dans le territoire hispanique. A partir de ce moment, surtout par l’intermediaire de Rome, on commence a avoir d’abondantes nouvelles sur les peuples qui habitaient l’Espagne pre-romaine, si bien malheureusement pas si explicites que nous ne voudrions. Tous les temoignages dont on dispose (information de geographes et historiens de l’antiquite, epigraphie peninsulaire, realite linguistique de l’Espagne actuelle) s’accordent pom nous assurer que la Peninsule Iberique n’a pas ete pleinement indo-europeisee avant l’arrivee des romains, mais qu’au contraire elle etait divisee grosso m odo en deux zones principals: 1) L’Espagne non-indo-europeenne a l’est et au sud, 2) L’Espagne indo-europeenne au nord et a l’ouest, comm’on рейх voir avec plus d’exactitude dans la carte no I. Chaqu’une de ces aires presente a son tour un aspect complexe que je commence a examiner tout de suite.



364 When Worlds Collide
T- - T.’HTSPANTA TNDOGERMANTCA A . - Les Celtes Parmi les elem ents indo-europeens de l’Espagne Prerromaine, les celtes sont celui que l’on connait avec plus de certitude. La presence des celtes est garantie par le temoignage des historiens grecs et latins, par une toponomastique variee et abondante et par une epigraphie specifique. Le principal etablissement celtique se trouve dans la region appelee Celtiberia par les historien grecs. Le nom de "celtiberes", que Гоп interpretait autrefois comme preuve de metissage'*', doit etre interprete aujourd’hui, selon toute vraisemblance, tout simplement comme synonyme de "ces habitants de l’lberie qui sont des celtes". Il sem ble prouve que la Celtiberie a ete l’etablissement plus solidement et depuis plus longtemps occupe par les celtes. Et il у a certains indices qui nous donnent lieu de penser que c’est de la Celtiberie qu’ils sont partis pour s’introduir vers le sud et le nordouest . La Celtiberie est delimitee au nord et nordest par le bassin moyen de l’Ebre (les provinces de Soria, Logrono et la partie suroccidental de Saragosse), quoique elle surpasse le fleuve vers le nord, et rentre dans Alava et Navarre pour atteindre Pampelune); au sud par les hauts bassins du Tajo et du Jucar (les provinces de Cuenca, Guadalajara et une partie de Teruel); a l’ouest elle occupe une partie des provinces de Madrid, Segovia et Burgos; et a Test lim ite avec les iberes du Levant. L’anthroponimie indo-europeenne preromaine est abondante. Et quoiqu’il existe une tendance, vraisemblablement injustifiee, a la considerer exdusivement celtique, il est evident qu’a cote des noms de nature celtique indubitable, comme Uramus (de *Uperamus), il у en a d’autres qui n’ont aucun trait specifiquement celtique, comme Seneca. U ne grande partie de la toponimie celtique de l’Espagne peut etre dassifiee dans des groupes caracteristiques. Bien significatifs sont les toponymes en seg(Segovia, Segobriga, Segeda, Segontia, Segisamo), en eburo (Eburobriga, Eburobrittium, Ebura, Evora) et ceux qui sont forme avec le suffixe du superlatif celtique -samo (Uxama, Ledesma, Segisama). Mais l’elem ent plus abondant et caracteristique de la toponimie celtique peninsulaire est la forme -briga, qui s’etend un peu partout dans ГHispania Indogermanica, quoiqu’elle surpasse cette frontiere dans le sud-ouest et s’introduit dans le sud du Portugal, ou Гоп trouve une epigraphie non celtique et vraisemblablement non-indo-europeenne. M eme si les toponymes en -briga sont connus aussi dans d’autres etablissements celtiques d’Europe, ils offrent dans la Peninsule Iberique une plus grand abondance qu’ailleur. Au contraire, les toponymes en -dunum, qui caracterisent d’autres 6tablissements celtiques, sont rares en Espagne (Verdu Verdun), et generalement ils sont le resultat de la penetration plus ou moins tardive d’elem ents gaulois. On pense que la cause c’est qu’en Espagne les celtes n’ont pas reussi a dominer l’ensem ble du territoire et ils ont ete obliges de le partager avec des populations hostiles. Et en consequence ils ont habite dans des lieux hauts et fortifies (briga), habitude profondement enracinee parmis les peuples indo-europeens. L’epigraphie celtique peninsulaire comprend plusieurs genres de documents: les monnaies, les steles funeraires et les tesserae hospitales sont les plus



Villar 365
caracteristiques. Mais au debut des annees ’70 apparut un nouveau document d’importance capitate pour la connaissance du celtiberique: Le "Bronze de Botorrita", qui est veritablement un des plus importants textes en celtique continental. La langue celtiberique possede des traits essentiels de la celtite, comme la perte du /р / initial et intervocalique, le developpement d’une voyelle / i / apres le / г / vocalique, le passage a sonores des anciennes sonores aspirees (ce dernier trait partage avec plusieres autres langues indo-europeennes). Mais il у a des aspects ou le celtiberique differe pas mal des autres langues cletiques. Or, le celtiberique n’a, a mon avis, aucun vestige sur de la lenition consonantique (malgre les affirmations entenduqs frecantm enr). Les diphthongues n’ont pas ete alterees , la voyelle /e : / non plus'; et la voyelle /Qj°/ seulement en partie. Il n’existe pas de double flexion verbale; les labiovelairesy sont conservees intactes; il a des postpositions au lieu de prepositions10 (ce qui est un archaisme remarcable, non seulement par rapport aux autres langues celtiques, mais aussi par rapport a la plus grande partie des langues indoeuropeennes): la desinence du gentif thematique n’est pas -i comme en vieux irlandais (ou en latin), mais en -o11, probablement de l’ancien ablatif , comme en baltique et en slave13. Touts les traits differenciels de la langue celtiberique par rapport aux autres langues celtiques sont done des archaismes, sauf le genitif en -o. Et en consequence il faut se limiter a affirmer qu’il s’agit de la varidte plus arcaique du celte connue. Mais nous n’avons pas de criteres pour l’attacher a aucune des branches dialectales traditionelles, gaelique ou britonnique. Introduits dans la Peninsule Iberique a travers les pas occidentaus des Pyrenees, selon on peut le deduir d’apres leur emplacement historique, les celtes se sont etablis au sud des hautes montagnes pyreneennes et ils ont reste isoles des celtes de la Gaule par l’intermediare de populations pre-indo-europeenes de nature basqueaquitanienne. Ainsi, ils sont devenus un "aire isolee", propice a la conservation des etats lingiiistiques archaiques.
В.-La Langue des Lusitaniens Dans la Peninsule Iberique, a cote de nombreux elem ents linguistiques dont la celtite ne pourrait pas etre mis en cause, il у en a d’autres munis de certains traits incompatibles avec ce que l’on prend normalement pour une langue celtique.
Entre les antroponimes nous avons Plendius, Pisirus, Paramecus, Palarus, Paesica. Parmi les etnonimes Pelendones, Paesici, Praestamarci. Et parmi les toponimes Paramus, Bletisama, Poemana, Pallantia, Pisuerga, e tc .^
Tous ces noms ont comme trait commun qu’il conservent le phoneme /р /, e’est pour cette raison qu’il n’est pas possible les considerer celtique sans plus. On trouve ces formes avec / р / un peu partout dans l’Espagne Indo-Europeenne. Mais evidemment la frequence est beaucoup moindre en Celtiberie et Carpetanie que dans les pays des Vaccei, Vettones et Lusitani, par exemple.
Malheureusement nous ne savons rien de la langue de la grande majorite des peuples de l’Espagne pre-romaine. Il n’y a aucune epigraphie des Astures, Cantabri, Callaici, Vettones, Vaccei, Carpetani, Pelendones, etc. Avant l’arrivee des romains, L’Espagne indo-europeenne ne connaissait pas 1’ecriture, a une exception pres: les celtiberes qui l’avait emprunte des iberes du Levant, leurs voisins orientaux. Neanmoms, on possede quelques inscriptions provenant du territoire des lusitaniens,



366 When Worlds Collide
ecrites en alphabet latin, qui correspondent a une epoque tardive dans laquelle les proces de romanisation etait deja a m oitie chemin. Il s’agit des inscriptions rupestres, en general tres breves, de nature votive. U ne des mieux connues decrit une offrande a plusieurs divinites qui a l’air d’etre un suovetaurilia^.
Or, dans ces inscriptions on trouve quelques temoignages du/ р / conserve (porcom, porgom, praisom, trebopala, toudopalandaigae) et aucun du / р / amui a la facons celtique. En outre, il у a certains autres traits qui ne sont pas compatibles non plus avec la celtite, comme la copulative indi (en face de kue, uta en celtiberique), inconnue dans les langues celtiques et present au contraire dans le germanique et l’indo-iranien. Et aussi le theme du present du verbe "donner", que l’on trouve dans la 3me du pluriel sous la forme doenti. U n des traits essentiels qui s’opposent au caractere celtique serait le passage des aspirees indo-europeennes a fricatives sourdes, selon on pourrait deduir du mot ifadem "italon" (dit d’un taureau). Mais malheureusement il n’existe que ce temoignage et son etymologie, quoique vraisemblable, n’est pas indiscutable. Mais, si on veut se faire une idee exact de la valuer de ce critere, il faut ajouter que le traitement contraire des aspirees (en sonores) n’est pas assure non plus, puisque il n’en existe aussi qu’un seul exemple (angom), dont l’etymologie en partant de la racine *angh- "etroit" doit a mon avis etre rejetee par des raisons semantiques et m orphologiques1^. A cote de ces arguments contraires, il en existent d’autres favorables au caractere celtique de la langue des lusitaniens. Nous avons d’un cote la distribution uniforme de la toponymie en -briga, qui ne se trouve pas seulement dans la Celtiberie, mais qui s’etend dans toute l’Espagne indo-europeenne, у compris la Lusitanie^ . En outre, l’uniformite de l’anthroponymie indoeuropeenne peninsulaire, un argument dont la valeur a ete recemment quelque peu amoindrie par Gorrochategui^° qui vient de souligner que malgre certains elements communs a la Lusitanie et la celtiberie, il у en a d’autres differentiels. Et, finalement, la presence dans les inscriptions lusitaniennes de certains traits compatibles avec la celtite comme le nominatif de pluriel thematique en o /19 et, surtout, une certaine quantite de vocabulaire celtique. La presence generalisee de la toponymie en -briga et l’uniformite de l’anthroponymie indoeuropeenne signifient, selon Untermann, qu’il n’a existe qu’une invasion indo-europeenne dans la Peninsule Iberique: celle des celtes. Comme nous avons deja vu, le celte peninsulaire est tres archaique. Et Untermann arrive a la conclusion que la conservation du /р / ne serait qu’un nouveau archaisme du dialecte celtique qui est rentre en Espagne. Je ne pourrais pas examiner ici en detail tous les arguments pour et contre la celtite de la langue des lusitaniens, ce au’ont fait recemment Schmidt et Gorrochategui d’un cote et Untermann de l’autre . Je vais me borner a une valoration d’ensem ble. U ne grande majorite des traits celtiques presents dans les inscriptions lusitaniennes appartient au domaine du lexique (y compris l’anthroponymie et l’element toponymique -briga). Or, comme on le sait tres bien, on pourrait expliquer ces coincidences lexiques comme le resultat du contact entre deux langues indoeuropeennes qui ont vecu ensemble pendant des siecles a l’interieur de la Peninsule Iberique.



Villar 367
En dehors du lexique, on trouve un argument morphologique dans le nominatif pluriel en -oi dans le substantif thematique. Mais ced est loin d’etre une preuve incontestable, puisqu’on trouve cette desinence dans la flexion nominal de plusieures autres langues, comme le baltique, le slave, le grec ou le latin). Et par contre, elle ne se trouve pas en celtiberique qui, une fois encore, conserve comme archaisme la desinence -os. Dans le domaine de la phonetique on n’a que le resultat incertain des aspirees. Tres peu pour considerer celtique cette langue . Mais, de leur cote, presque tous les traits contraires a la celtite pourraient aussi etre rejetes comme de possibles emprimts, fausses etymologies, etc. si on les envisageseparement. Mais si on les considere ensem ble il parait peu raisonnable denier la valeur de tous et penser que le hasard a reuni dans un ensem ble de textes si limite autant de faux indices contre la celtite de la langue des lusitaniens. Et en plus, il reste le probleme du /р /. Si le celte de la Peninsule Iberique est depourvu de presque tous les traits qui ordinairement servent a caracteriser les langues celtiques et a leur place il a les respectifs archaismes serait-il permis d’imaginer qu’il conserve aussi le / р / comme un archaisme et que, en consequence, seulement une partie des envahisseurs celtiques l’ont perdu apres s’etre installe en Espagne? Et, en cas affirmatif, qu’est ce qui nous reste encore comme constitutif du celtism e linguistique? En poussant la question a l’extreme: quel raison aurait-on pour appeler une langue "celte" quand elle n’a pas encore acquis un seul trait de ceux qui carcaterisent ce type de langue indo-europeenne? Si la langue des lusitaniens est depourvue de tous les traits essentiels de la celtite, quel argument pourrait-on avancer pour assurer que, malgre tout, ils sont des celtes? Aucun de nature linguistique qu’on puisse considerer solide, comme nous venons de constater. Peut-etre, ce que veulent dire ces savants qui croient a la celtite du lusitanien c’est qu’il derive de la meme tradition linguistique qui, en developpant ses traits historiques, est devenue ailleurs le celtique. Mais une telle croyance tombe en dehors des possib ility de controle d’un linguiste, qui doit se borner a constater que la variete de l’indo-europeen parlee par les lusitaniens, malgre le vocabulaire celtique qu’elle partage, ne se laisse pas classifier comme ce qu’on entend ordinairement par une langue celtique. Or, si le lusitanien n’est pas celtique, il faut definir a quelle modalite de l’indo-europeen il appartient. En laissant de cote l’opinion de quelques savants du passe (Abois de Juvainville, Jullian) qui la consideraient ligur, Tovar a pense a un certain moment que c’etait AlteuropdischL . Schmoll a ete le premier a supposer qu’il s’agissait d’une s nouvelle branche de la famille indo-europeenne qu’il a appele Gallakisch . A present ceele-ci est l’oppinion generate parmis ceux qui ne la considerent pas celtique, mais c’est le nom "lusitanien" tout court qui s’est im pose^ . Et quelle est la position dialectal du lusitanien dans l’ensem ble des langues indo-europeennes? Il semble evidnet qu’il s’agit d’un dialecte occidental ou peut-etre sudoccidental. Mais il n’est pas facile pour le moment de preciser d’avantage. Par exemple l’aproximation au grec proposee par K.H. Schmidt‘S parait peu fonde en attachant trop de valeur au pr6tendu resultat / о / de la laryngale dans la troisieme pluriel doenti.
C. - Le Alteuropaisch



368 When Worlds Collide
Nous avons done examine deux dialectes indoeuropeens: l)C elui avec voyelles / о / et / а / differenciees et /р / amui (c’est a dire, le celte), et 2)Celui avec voyelles / а / et / о / differenciees et /р / conserve (c’est a dire, le lusitanien). Or, il у a vraisemblablement un troisiem e dans lequel le / р / est conserve mais les voyelles / а / et / о / sont confondues en /а /. D e cette troisiem e langue indoeuropeenne il ne subsistent que des toponymes, surtout des hydronymes, qui sont pourvus des memes traits phonetiques et morphologiques que ceux qui ont mene Krahe a sa theorie de l’Alteuropaisch . L’etude de cette espece d’hydronymie peninsulaire a fete faite par de Hoz. Les racines plus frequemment utilisees sont *ab-, *ad~, *alm-, *ar-, *arg-, *kar-, *nar-, *sal- et *sar-, toutes presentes comme appellatifs dans l’une ou l’autre des langues indoeuropeennes, avec la signification "fleuve", "fontaine", "eau" et d’autres notions pareilles. Les vides qu’on trouve dans la catre ne doivent pas etre pris trop rigoureusement, puisqu’ils pourraient etre dus a une documentation insuffisante d’ou puiser l’information plutot qu’a une manque reelle de cette hydronymie. Tout de mfeme, l’absence absolue dans le coin sudoccidental ne saurait etre le fruit du hasard. Vraisemblablement, les populations centre-europeennes responsables de cette hydronymie sont entrees du nord vers le sud, de meme que leurs successeurs plus recents, les celtes, et n’ont jamais atteint ces regions lointaines, trop ecartees ou mieux defendues. L’identification de ces elem ents indo-europeens dans Phydronymie peninsulaire et la reconaissance de leur antiquite n’implique pas l’acceptation des idfees de Krahe sur l’Alteuropaisch. A mon avis, le Aleuropaisch.ne doit pas etre compris comme la langue commune de laquelle derivent les langues indo-europeennes occidentales, comme voulait Krahe. Et encore moins toutes les langues indoeuropfeennes, selon prefere W.P. Schmid28. Vraisemblablemente cette hydronymie doit etre considere plutot comme la preuve de la presence d’une strate indoeuropeenne dans la Peninsule Ibferique (et dans toute l’Europe occidentale) a une date anterieure a l’arrivee d’une autre strate plus rfecente d’ou derivent les peuples indoeuropeens historiques de l’Europe (celte, germanique, lusitanien, etc.) Le trait phonfetique de l’indistinction de / а / et / о / est vraisemblablement un archaisme, au contraire de ce qu’on pense ordinairement, comme j’ai essaye de montrer ailleurs . Et cela est en harmonie avec la plus haute antiquite de cette hydronymie dans toute l’Europe. Il existe, parait-il, certaines donnees archeologiques qui pourraient renforcer l’idfee d’une penfetration indo-europeenne dans l’Espagne long temps avant l’arrivfee des celtes. Dans le gisement de "La Hoya", pres de Vitoria, on a trouve des materiaux typiquement centre-europeens, parmis lesquel ils ne manquent pas des signes solaires comme la svastika, dans une strate datee comme appartenant au xVeme siecle a.C. Ces groupes, arrivfes de l’autre cote des Pyrenfees, sont entres en contact avec les communautes des cultures mfegalitiques du cercle du Vase Campaniforme qui existaient deja dans ce territoire. Et il у a des preuves d’fechanges culturels entre les deux groupes. Dans d’autres niveaux plus recents du meme gisement, qui correspondent au XIIIem e siecle a. C. on decele de nouvelles entrees de gens de l’Europe centrale qui amenent avec eux de nouveaux types de construction. Je ne рейх pas apporter plus des details sur ces trouvailles archeologiques parce que les resultats de la fouille, dirige au present nar Armando LLanos, n’a pas encore etfe publiee et il n’en existe qu’un bref resum e'’0 .



Villar 369
En somme, nous avons ete capable d’etablir trois strates indo-europeennes dans la Peninsule Iberique, qui peuvent etre distinguees par de criteres linguistiques. Mais il serait une simplification supposer que seulement dans trois occasions des elem ents indo-europeens sont rentres dans l’Espagne. Cesar (BC 1.51) raconte que. quand il etait en Espagne, pres d’llerda, un groupe de chevaliers gaulois est arrive pres de son armee. Ils etaient 6.000 guerriers qui menaient avec eux leurs esclaves, femmes et enfants. Peut- etre 20.000 personnes dans l’ensemble. Sans doute ils cherchaient des terres pour s’y installer. D es faits pareils ont du avoir lieu d’innombrables fois, sans que le hasard les ai tm ises a la portee d’un historien qui ait pu nous en preter son temoignage. Comme Garcia у Bellido a dit"^, il ne faut pas s’imaginer autrement le proces d’indoeuropeenisation de la Peninsule Iberique (et pourrait-on ajouter: peut-etre aussi de toute l’Europe). Nous pouvons deduir, done, que pendant 1500 annees au moins une lente penetration d’elem ents indo-europeens a eu lieu en Espagne qui a change petit a petit sa composition linguistique. La populaiton n’a pas du etre trop nombreuse et ainsi les indo-europeens et les pre-indo europeens on pu partager le territoire dans de petites communautes imbriquees entretenants des relation qui on du arriver frequemment jusqu’au bilinguisme. Avec le temps, les elem ents indo-europeens se sont imposes dans le nord et l’ouest, la ой peut-etre ils ont trouve la moindre resistance, Dans l’est et le sud ils ont dfl trouver des le debut de plus grandes difficultes, vraisemblablement parcequ’ils se sont heurtes a des cultures superieures (le Argar, Tartessos). Et la les elem ents pre-indoeuropeens ont pu subsister jusqu’a l’arrivee des romains.

II,- L’HISPANIA NON-INDO-EUROPEENNE A.- Les Iberes
Sans doute l’elem ent le plus caracteristique de l’Espagne pre-romaine c’est le peuple iberique, avec sa langue hermetique, son systeme d’ecriture particulier et son art dont le caractere original ou imite du grecque on discute encore.II
II La Toponimie
La Peninsule Iberique apparait divisee par une ligne, tiree il у a quelque temp par Unterm am r , qui delimite une region sud-occidental ou dominent les toponymes en II- (Iltir-, Ши-, Ш-) et une autre nord-occidentale avec des toponymes en briga.
Comme on le voit sur la carte I, cette ligne ne coincide pas avec celle qui separe l’Espagne indo-europeenne de l’Espage non-indo-europeenne. Les formes en briga surpassent la division et penetrent dans le coin sud-occidental du territoire nonindo-europeen. La toponymie en II- est celle qui caracterise le domaine iberique, mais elle surpasse de son cote les Pyrenees et s’etend vers le sud de la France jusqu’a la ville d’Enserune.



370 When Worlds Collide
Malgre notre meconaissance de la langue iberique, il ne parait pas hasardeux si l’on suppose que l’elem ent toponymique II- est la racine ou une des racines iberiques pour exprimer la notion de "ville" ou quelque achose pareille.
2) L’ecriture L’Espagne pre-romaine disposal! de son propre systeme d’ecriture, d’inspiration vraisemblablement phenicienne , dont l’existence a ete connue des le Moyen Age, au fur et a mesure qu’on a rencontre des monnaies frappees dans l’antiquite. Sa lecture ne fut, malgre tout, possible jusqu’aux annees ’20 de notre siecle, quand Gom ez Moreno'” a reussi a la dechiffrer. Il s’agit d’un systeme mixte, m oitie syllabaire et m oitie alphabetique, qui avait deroute les savants pendant des siecles. Tout en restant le meme pour l’essentiel, ce systeme a des variantes locales, pas toutes completement dechiffrees. La mieux connue est celle du Levant. Et celle qui nous offre le plus de problemes est celle des inscriptions tartessiques. L’aire d’utilisation de chaqu’une des ces varietes peut etre examinee sur la carte. Ce systeme d’ecriture est foncierement celui des peuples nonindoeuropeens, l’Espagne indo-europeenne etant analphabetique. Mais dans le bassin moyen de l’Ebre, dans la region ou etait dtablie la frontiere entre les Iberes et les Celtiberes, les celtes ont enprunte ce susteme, comme nous avons deja vu. L’epigraphie en langue ibere dont nous avons connaissance est generalment dans ce systeme. Mais il у a un groupe de documents en alphabet grecque, ce qui a facilite enormement le dechiffrement de l’ecriture locale.3
3) La Langue Nous avons trois especes de documents plus frequents dans la langue des Iberes: des monnaies, des inscriptions funeraires et des plombs . Ces derniers sont les textes les plus longs; mais nous ignorons toujours quelle est leur nature et teneur. Malgre le fait que soixante ans se sont deja ecoules depuis le dechiffrement de l’ecriture, la langue des Iberes defie encore les efforts qu’on fait pour arriver a la comprendre. D ’elle nous ne savons presque rien avec certitude. Et le peu que nous savons appartient au domaine de la phonetique. La langue ibere avait 5 voyelles (a /e /i/o /u ); un systeme de 5 consonnes occlusives (-/b , t/d , k /g ) ou il manque le /p /; 3 nasales (m /n et une troisiem e dont la nature est inconnue; deux vibrantes; deux laterales; et deux sifflantes . Les vibrantes, comme il arrive dans pas mal de langues, ne peuvent pas etre le phoneme initial de m ot. La structure syllabique est soumise a de differentes restrictions. La voyelle ne peut etre precedee que par une seule consonne. Il n’existe meme pas le groupe muta cum liquida. Par contre, elle peut etre suivie d’un nombre indetermind de consonnes, a l’unique condition qu’elles suivent un ordre d’ouverture descendante (U + R + S + T ). Les phonemes / у / et /w / consonantiques sont rares ou peut-etre inexistants au debut de syllabe. U ne structure syllabique semblable a ete imaginee par M ichelena pour la prehistoire de la langue basque37. Et nous verrons dans ce qui suit que des ressemblances pareilles entre le basque et l’iberique ne font pas defaut. Plus tard j’essayerai d’en faire une valoration d’ensemble.



Villar 371
Apres certains themes on trouve en ibere une alternance des elem ents -n /r/-o , mais on ne sait meme pas s’il sagit d’un fait phonetique ou morphologique. Je laisse de cote l’etrange ressemblance avec l’heteroclise indo-europeenne, et souligne par contre que dans cette occasion aussi on trouve dans le basque un fait semblable, remarque par Tovar*’®: egu-n "jours" (avec /n /) /egur-aldi "temps atmosfpherique (avec /r / ) / egu-berri "Jour nouveau" (dit de N oel) (avec O). Beaucoup moins et beaucoup moins sur est ce que nous savons sur la morphologie et la syntaxe. Je vais faire mention de quelques hypoteses. A . Tovar et L. Michelena3y ont vu, avec des differences dans le detail, que le suffixe -en servait a exprimer la relation determinant-determine entre deux noms, avec un ordre GN: Iltibifkis-en seltar serait probablement "la tombe d’lltibirgis". Une fois encore, on trouve un parallele dans le basque, ou il existe un suffixe possesif -en. Mais l’ibere aurait aussi, selon Michelena4^, im autre moyen pour exprimer la meme fonction: la juxtaposition de deux noms sans aucun morpheme dans l’ordre determinant-determine: kalun seltar " la tombe de Calun". Si bien cette possibilit6 de juxtapositionn’existe pas dans le basque contemporain, c’est encore M ichelena qui Га reconstruit pour la prehistoire du basque41. Dans les monnaies on a des formes avec une espece de desinence -(s)cen, qui sont le parallele des genitifs pluriels latins ROMANOM, grecs EMPORITOM, celtiberique KONTEBAKOM, etc. Tout naturellement, il у a pas mal de savants qui se sentent attires a voir dans cette desinence le morpheme de genitif pluriel. Et une fois encore cela rappelle la desinence basque de genitive pluriel -en dont l’accentuation exige une contraction prehistorique de la voyelle a partir d’une possible forme -*agen . Dans les monnaies iberiques, la desinence -(s)cen alterne dans la meme fonction avec -(e)tar, qui trouve aussi un parallele basque dans le suffixe -(t)ar qui sert a former des noms ethniques comme vizcaitarra, etc. D e Hoz4® a suggere Pexistence en Ibere d’un morpheme -ka avec la valeur d’ablatif et/o u datif d’int6ret. Et dans un travail recent Untermann44 a propose l’identification de plusieurs morphemes: -ka serait un ergatif; -te un datif; -ar un possesif; etc. Meme si ces morphemes et leur fonction sont purement hypothetiques, comme Untermann a lui meme signale , il faut rappeler qu’encore une fois il existe un parallele en basque dont le morpheme d’ergatif est, comme tout le monde le sait, -k. Dans le domaine du lexique, si on laisse de cote le mot voyageur pour designer l’argent, que nous trouvans en ibere sous la forme salir^ , nous ne savons pratiquement rien sur le vocabulaire iberique. Dans une inscription funeraire on trouve are face, suivi de la formule latine HEIC EST. Mais on ne peut pas etre sur si les mots latins sont la traduction des mots iberes. Pour se faire une idee du degre d’incertitude de nos demarches, il suffira si je cite le cas du mot eban(en), present dans des inscription funeraires. Pour Tovar elle signifie "Pierre, tombeau". Pour Michelena c’est le nom pour "fils". Et fmalement pour Untermann ce serait un verbe qu’il faudrait traduir par "curauit".
B.- LE BASQUE En tant que langue qui a reussi a survivre apres l’indo-europeensiation en general et apres la romanisation en particulier, le basque est une langue parfaitement connu, ce qui m’epargnera de longues explications sur sa structure. Je vais me limiter a quelques remarques sur sa situation dans l’epoque pre-romaine.



Le nom avec lequel nous connaissons au present ce peuple et sa langue est l’heritier de celui d’une de ses anciennes tribus, les Vascones, qui occupait les alentours de Pampelune, la capitate de la Navarre. Les basques eux memes ils appellent leur langue "Euskara" et leur pays "Eskalherria", mot natifs que je vais employer desormais pom nommer l’ensem ble de tribus qui parlaent cette langue dans l’antiquite. Selon Tovar4^, a l’interieur de la Peninsule Iberique, outre les Vascones, il у avait d’autres groupes qui parlaient aussi euskara, comme les Autrigones, Caristii et Varduli vers l’ouest jusqu’au Nervion et la ville de Bilboa; et peut-etre les Airenosii et les Andorsini vers l’est. Et de l’autre cote des Pyrenees, il faut tenir pour demontre, d’apres les travaux de Michelena4® et Gorrochategui , que la langue des Aquitains etait aussi Euskara. Quand meme, il у en a d’autres (comme de H oz) pour qui dans le territoire des Varduli, Caristii et Autrigones il n’y a qu’une chose de sure: que la dedans on parlait une langue indo-europeenne (sans qu’on puisse determiner quel dialecte). Et on ne saurait pas assurer si cette langue indo-europeenne a partage le territoire avec des populations pre-indo-europeennes, euskariennes ou autres. Sans doute, l’Euskara est la langue d’un peuple essentiellem ent pyreneen, qui s’etend sur 1’un et l’autre versant de la chaine. D ’apres tous les indices il a du occuper ce territoire au moins a partir du neolithique. Et la il s’est vu presse par plusiers peuples envahisseurs des le premier instant ou nous trouvons des traces dans la P roto-H istoire. Peut-etre un des traits qui caracterisent le plus la langue euskarienne c’est exactement celui-la. Toujours, a partir des premiers moments connus ou entrevus, elle a ete une langue pressee et une langue en retraite en face d’autres langues de culture et organization sociale superieures. Mais elle a reuissi a survivre malgre tout, meme si elle a du payer comme prix une profonde penetration dans sa substance des langues qui ont agicomme adstrate et superstrate.
Les relations entre le basque et l’ibere La these la plus etendue encore aujourd’hui parmi les savants non specialistes est peut-etre celle du Basco-Iberisme qui consiste a supposer que dans l’Espagne pre-romaine (peut-etre aujourd’hui faudrait-il dire "indo-europeenne") il n’existait qu’une langue, l’lbere, dont le Basque contemporain n’est que la survivance. Cette croyance existait deju parmi les savants espagnols depuis le Moyen Age. Et elle s’est perpetuee, consideree un fait acquis mais restreine a l’ambiance espagnole, jusqu’au XIX s., quand elle a recu credit international grace au prestige de von Humboldt qui lui avait prete son approbation. Comme ca la these du BascoIberisme s’est repandu dansr toute l’Europe. Les preuves qui ont convaincu von Humboldt n’etaient ni trop nombreuses ni trop solides, quoiqu’elles etaient bien attrayantes. Le savant allemand a ete frappe par l’identite de Iriberri "Ville neuve" (basque)/Iliberri(ibere), et il en tira son principal argument. Nous pourrions ajouter que parmi l’onomastique euskarienne et l’onomastique ibere il у a de nombreux paralleles. Dans 1’une et l’autre langue les anthroponymes sont batis sous la forme de composes de deux elem ents qui peuvent etre melanges de plusieures facons, comme il arrive aussi dans l’onomastique indoeuropeenne. Mais les paralleles ne se limitent pas au precede abstrait de la composition. En plus, ils s’entandent aussi aux elem ents concrete qui rentrent en

Villar 373
composition. Ces elem ents se retrouvent dans l’onomastique ibere, dans l’onomastique aquitaine et parois ils sont aussi presents dans l’euskara comme des appellatifs:ib beles, aquitain Belex eusk. beltz "noir"'> . En outre, il convient de se rappeler que la lecture en haute voix d’un texte iberique produit l’impression qu’il sagit d’un texte euskarien. Mais, malgre tout, les spedalistes les plus qualifies, ceux qui s’y connaissent le mieux a la fois en euskarien et en iberique, sont generalement sceptiques par rapport a tout degre de relation genetique entre les deux langues. Et ils ont pas mal de raisons. Tout d’abord, l’euskarien n’aide pas a compredre un seul mot des textes iberique. Il sem ble que si le basque etait la forme moderne de l’ibere il pourrait aider au moins dans une modeste mesure. Il faut rappeler que ce sont presque mil mots iberiques que nous possedons deja et, en laissant de cote l’onomasstique, il n’y a aucun qui puisse etre interpretee par le basque. Le basque n’a meme pas servi a identifier les pronoms personnels, les termes qui expriment les relation de fam ille, les numeraux ni, en general, le vocabulaire plus stable des langues. Le systeme verbal du basque ne trouve aucun reflet en ibdrique. Et le nominal non plus, si l’on exclu quelques faits plutot isoles et hautement hypothetiques, deja mentionnes. Ces droles de relations entre le Basque et l’lbere nous paraissent plutot deroutantes. Car elles sont trop lim itees pour en deduir une relation genetique, mais trop nombreuses pour ne pas meriter une explcation. La dessu M ichelena a dit .
Et c’est ici, dans ce sous-ensemble di-sons onomastique, que l’on a trouve la plupart des coincidences entre ibere et basque. Il у a, cela ne fait pas de doute, des accords, dont le nombre est trop eleve pour qu’on puisse les attribuer aux seuls jeux du hasard..."(1979, p.37). "Mais en faisant sa part au hasard, les coincidences sont remar-quables en nobre et en qualite. On hesitera done a у voir des empruts massifs".
Sans prendre une position plus nette, Michelena a suggere l’explication qui suit pour les coincidences onomastiques entre le Basque et l’lbere, qui a son avis sont les plus importantes, selon on peut deduire de ses mots:
"On dirait done qu’ibere et euskarien avaient forme une espece de pool onomastique, qu’ils possedaient un stock un grande partie commun d’elem ents et de precedes de formation, dans lequel ils puisaient avec une grande liberte. Il n’est pas dit pour autant que ces elem ents devaient etre homogenes quant a l’origine".
S’il s’agit, comme actuelement pensent la plupart des savants, d’une relation de langues en contracte, il n’est pas hardi si on pense que la plupart des traits communs entre le basque et l’ibere ont du passer de l’ibere au basque plutot que dans le sens contraire, car l’ibere etait la langue d’une culture superieure, qui avait un systeme d’eciture et qui avait des rapports avec les grandes civilisations mediterraneennes .
Relations entre le basque et les langues indo-europeennes peninsulaires



374 When Worlds Collide
La mesure de la pression exercee des Pantiquite par les langues indoeuropeennes sur le basque trouve son reflet dans le fait, anecdotique si l’on veut, que le premier temoignage ecrit du nom des VASCONES apparait sur des monnaies, vraisemblablement de l’atelier monnaitaire de Pampelune, dans lesquelles on peut lire BASCUNES, avec un nominatif pluriel indo-europeen, plus exactement celtriberique, puisque Pamelune etait limitrophe entre les territoires celtiberes et euskariens. Tout de meme, il faut remarquer que selon Untermann54 sur ces monnaies, dont il existe une variante BARSCUNES, on aurait le nom d’une ville celtiberique, dont l’evidente ressemblance avec le nom des VASCONES serait purement fortuite. L’indoeuropeanisation du vocabulaire basque est profonde, a partir surtout du latin et des langues romanes. Mais il existe sans doute une couche anterieure de type celtitque, pas toujours facile a separer . Michelena soulignait qu’un mot comme errege "roi" pourrait etre un emprunt au celte aussi bien qu’au latin, puisque dans le celte peninsulaire la /e : / n’a pas ete fermee en /i: /. Le basque, outre l’indo-europeanisation de son vocabulaire, partage avec d’autres langues de la region plusiers traits dont l’origine n’est pas facile a etablir. Il a le meme systeme vocalique (a /e /i/o /u ) que l’espagnol, l’ibere et quelques dialectes gascons. П a deux vibrantes, comme l’espagnol et l’ibere, differenciees par le nombre des vibrations. Et, de meme que l’espagnol, il a deux realisations differentes pour les occlusives sonores: occlusives au debut de m ot/fricatives entre voyelles.
C.- LA REGION MERIDIONALE Dans le sud de la Peninsule Iberique, dans ce qui est aujourd’hui la moitie occidentale de l’Andalousie et le sud du Portugal, on trouve une toponymie non indoеиогорёеппе, mais differente de la toponymie iberique deja examinee. Deux racines sont caracteristiques de cette toponymie: 1) ip-/-i(p)p° et 2)obu-/-uba. L’une et l’autre peuvent apparaitre, avec de petites modifications, comme premier et comme second element des composes toponymiques.
Pour le premier, nous avons Ollispo, Colipo, Baesippo, Ventipo, Orippo, Iptuci. Normalement on etablit un rapport avec des toponymes du nord de l’Affique comme Hippo Regius, Hippo Diarrhytus. Pour le second nous trouvons Oba, Obulco, Corduba, Onoba, Ossonoba, Salduba. Et il n’existe, dans la messure de ma connaissence, aucun parallele en dehors de l’Espagne. D ’ordinaire on considere que les deux genres de toponymes appartiennent a une meme couche de population, quoique il n’en existe aucune preuve. On a, c’est vrai, un exemple ou les deux apparaissent unis: Iponuba. Mais ca ne prouve rien, parcequ’ on a pas mal de toponymes d’hybridation evdente, comme Augustrobriga, Juliobriga. D ’autre cote, meme si les deux elem ents se recouvre en partie, ils n’ont pas une distribution tout a fait uniforme, puisque -i(p)po surpasse la zone commune et penetre assez au nord de Portugal avec Olisippo et surtout Collipo. Mais ce ne sont pas les seuls elem ents toponymique de l’Andalousie. Dans la region suroccidentale on trouve aussi Bae- dans des noms comme Baelo, Baetis (le fleuve), qui reapparait ailleurs dans la Peninsule, et qui parfois se trouve associe a un des autres elem ents precites, comme Baesippo. Un type d’anthroponymie pre-indo-europeenne, exclusif de cette region peninsulaire, coincide grosso m odo avec l’aire de diffusion de la toponymie meridionale.



Villar 375
Ce sont des noms formes avec la racine Sis-, toumours prefixee: Sisiren, Siseanba, Sisen, Siseia, etc.
Il est naturel si l’on associe ce type d’antroponymes avec les toponymes en i(p)po et -uba, puisqu’ils partagent le meme territoire. Et puisqu’ils ne sont pas ni indo europeens ni iberiques, on pense a un troisiem e peuple qui aurait occupe vraisemblablement l’Andalousie ocddentale avant d’etre envahie par des iberes a l’est (avec des toponymes comme Ilipa, Ilipula) et par des celtes au nord-ouest (avec des toponymes comme Nertobriga, Ebord).
Enfin, dans le coin suboccidental de cette region on trouve pas mal de documents, inscrits dans la moins claire des variet& d’Scriture iberique et rddiges dans une langue differente de l’ibere. Le plus grand nombre de ces textes appartiennent au sud du Portugal. Mais on en a quelques-uns en Andalousie ocddentale et m&me en Estremadure. Il faut у ajouter les monnaies trouvees a Salacia, petite ville du Portugal, a m oitie chemin entre les fleuves Guadiana et Tajo. E lies sont inscrites dans la meme variety d’alphabet, mais rien peut nous assurer pour le moment que dans ce systeme d’ecriture il n’y ait qu’une seule langue. Sauf les monnaies de Salada, toute cette epigraphie est funeraire . L’ecriture prend la forme concentrique et elle manque de precedes pour separer les mots. C’est pourquoi, le premier probleme consiste a diviser les textes en unitees successives. Le second derive de la meconnaissance de certains si^nes. Et le troisiem e c’est d’etablir la date de ces textes, quoique aujourd’hui il parait qu’il s’est imposee l’opinion qui attribue cette epigraphie aux siecles VII et VI a.C. . Tout le monde sait qu’a cet endroit et a cette epoque florissait le royaume de Tartessos. Et c’est pour cela que quelques savants croient que ces inscriptions funeraires mettent dans nos mains la langue de ce mythique royaume. Autres, au contraire, preffirent la prudence d’appeler tout ce material tout simplement "epigraphie sudoccidentale", ou quelque chose comme ca. D e H oz (communication personnelle) croit que l’epigraphie du sud de Portugal pourrait mettre a notre portee la langue des Conti, tandis que les inscriptions dans le meme alphabet trouvees en Andalousie pourraient gtre redigrees dans la langue de Tartessos. Salada, de sa part, serait une colonie tartessienne et ses monnaies devraient etre mises en raport avec les inscriptions et la langue de l’Andalousie. En fait, il ne pourrait etre le fruit du hasard que l’anthroponymie en Sis- soit presente aussi a Salacia. Probablement ce’st un indice en faveur de l’association de cette onomastique en Sis- et la langue des inscriptions de l’Andalouisie. D e tout ce qui precede se degage le fait que les inscriptions tartessiennes restent indechiffrable. Mais, malgre tout, quelques savants croient pouvoir isoler certains elem ents qui constituent la formule funeraire et ont propose pour eux une traduction. En fair, la formule bare nabe keenti se repete dans un bon nombre d’occasions. si bien le troisieme mot offre quelques variantes, comme keeni. Wikanderiy croyait avoir trouve un parallele dans des inscriptions funeraires lidennes, dans lesquelles on lit sijeni "situs est". Il s’agit de la racine *kei- "etre couche", "gSsir" (cf.gr. keimai, aisate) avec le. meme suffixe que les verbes hittites du type ijannai. Quant aux varianges keeni/keenti, il croit у decouvrir la difference singulier/pluriel, selon la conjugaison hittite en -hi'.



Il parait que les ide'es de Wikander sont partagees par C orrea^. Et ce ne serait pas tout. Il faudrait у ajouter au moins un autre troit indo-europeen: nabe serait un locatif avec la desinence -*bhi. Ainsi, on devrait traduire la formule funeraire complete comme: "Il git dans ce tombeau". Enfin, il serait aussi possible d’identifier une desinence de genitif -el, qui nous amene de nouveau aux langues antoliennes. Si Wikander et Correa avaient raison, lalangue de Tartessos serait une langue indo-europeenne de type anatolien. Et on aurait encore une fois une civilisation mediterraneenne, traditionnellement consideree pre-indoeuropeenne, comme il est arrive auparavant avec le hittite et le micenien. On soupconnait d’avance une certaine relation entre Tartessos et quelques elem ents indo-europeens, soi-disant celtes, d’apres le nom du plus fameux des rois tartessiens. Meme si on laisse de cote tout ce qu’il puisse у avoir de symbolique de la part des historiens grecs pour appeler "Argantonios" le roi du pays mythique de l’argent, et on accepte qu’en fait le nom de ce roi aurait ete vraiment indo-europeennes, ca nous permetraitt tout au plus de supposer qu’il se serait produit une certaine penetration indo-europeenne dans le royaume de Tartessos qui aurait peut-etre constitue une espece d’aristocratie dominatrice, comme il s’est passe dans d’autres endroits. Si les hypotheses de Wikander et Correa s’averait exactes, et les inscriptions tartessiennes sont en fait redigees dans une langue indo-europeenne, il ne serait pas necessaire de trop changer des idees precedentes. Il n’est que naturel que cette soidisant aristocratie guerriere aurait utilise sa langue pour ses habitudes funeraires, meme si les couches plus anciennes de la population n’avaient jamais appris la langue de la couche dominate. Et ce serait a cette population pre-indo-eurpeenne qu’appartiendrait la toponymie qui caracterise la region. Rien de tout cela est invraisemblable. Et d’autre cote, la possible origine anatolienne reste en parfait accord avec la chronologie du commencement du royaume Tartessos et la chute de l’empire hittite et l’exode subsequent. Mais tout ce tableau, qui semble peut-etre attractif et coherent, a un gros cote faible: le caractere pour le moment speculatif de Interpretation de la formule funeraire et le petite nombre d’elements sur lesquels l’hypotese a ete etayee.

DISCUSSION
Editors:
The following is but a brief sampling of the transcribed taped discussion from the conference. Some tapes were defective; particularly unfortunate, was that of Edgar Polom e’s detailed critique o f Colin Renfrew’s presentation. The following, which conveys the flavor of the lively give-and-take o f the conference, is exerpted from the general discussion that followed Colin Renfrew’s presentation.
Edgar C. Polome: May I just say something? It is a fact that there were Mesopotamian colonies as early as 1930 BC in Asia Minor, very close to the end of the period you indicate. If this kind o f people had been there, then why wouldn’t there have been any mention of such people?
Colin Renfrew: I think there is. I have understood that there were reflections of H ittites.
Edgar C. Polome: Y es, of H ittites, but not of others.
Colin Renfrew: But what are we talking about here, the Luwians, and so on? I don’t think I see any problem here. It’s in the early period that we have a parenthesis, and then in the historical period we have Luwian and Palaic and H ittite, and these are reflected in the writings o f Boghazkoy and earlier.
Eric P. Hamp: But two of them only secondarily.
Colin Renfrew: But I’m not asserting that there was a greater variety. This is the very point Professor Villar is raising. I’m not suggesting that there were more than two or three groups and more interesting and more difficult, I quite agree, there is the fact that the non-Indo-European Hattie group was also surviving at that time.
Thomas V. Gamkrelidze: But why, then, did Hattie have no writing at all, the cultural writing o f a small group?
Charles Burney: Might I inject a small point? W hile my real questions are on tradition, I must add here that there are texts which refer to writing on tablets of wood, but that wouldn’t take us back to the time to which you are referring. Could I raise one or two more points? I would willingly settle for a fairly orthodox view of farming spreading from Anatolia to Europe, even though sad to say perhaps, from som e points of view that would be an implied spread from west to east into the steppes. But I must say that, from the point of view of the origin of the farm, this is, in a way, an ultra-diffusionist point o f view. It could be right about the Indo-European population in Central Anatolia, but I think we must distinguish between Central and Eastern Anatolia. I think that the arguments we heard from Heiner Eichner yesterday and the linguistic



picture m ilitate against much here: Colin Renfrew simply cannot be right about the eastern zone in the wider economic sense. The fact is that there is fairly good evidence for goods production in W estern Iran at earlier periods, though not as early as Jericho and places like that. W e are now talking about the 17th and 18th millennia, the 17th millenium in W estern Iran. That arrow on Renfrew’s map showing arrows going across Iran (Fig. 8.4, p. 207 in Renfrew 1987) is, I think, a flight of fantasy, at least from my point of view anyway. A s far as Eastern Anatolia goes, climatic, that is, environmental factors there seem to me rather hostile to a homeland there for the Proto-IndoEuropeans, point is that the mountains start from a plateau level of five to six thousand feet above sea level. It is what the Turks call a winter country, very inhospitable, and those arrows which are central, I suppose you could call them Anatolian, are on the periphery. So I think you should probably be a bit careful about putting blobs on the map, and that also applies to a reconstruction. I see that area - alright, it’s my own stomping ground, as a defensive zone in a sense, not a zone from which great movements, whether by 'Wave o f Advance" or whatever model, come. I do think, finally, that this approach is essentially a European approach. That alone doesn’t invalidate it, but one has reservations whether the spread of farming goes with the IndoEuropeans to Europe.
Colin Renfrew. What I’d like to say is that it seems to me that the Eastern side of things is a little less clear, I mean lingusitically less clear. It seems to me not inconceivable, I just leave it as a question, that the first farmers of Turkmenia might also have been speaking an Indo-European language. In which case, we have no problem with all of the orientalist early sites in the highlands of Iran, the plateau of Iran.
Daniel Zohary: Two comments. One just to make an addition. I’m also not very enthusiastic about the eastern highlands. You are talking about the continental part of anatolia, and then when you climb from the plateau up to the mountainous area of Eastern Turkey, then you are coming from a region in which wheat and barley can survive in the wild into a region in which they are totally out o f the ecological picture. It is the same as we know, for instance, that in Europe the agriculturally rich higher mountains of the Alps were rather late to be colonized compared with the colonization of the main lowlands, especially the loess soil lowlands. I would use this same argument with respect to the higher plateaus of Anatolia. I feel that this is secondary in terms of time: you have to have developed types of cultivars that could survive there, maybe only relatively later, or even secondary things such as bread wheats which are reproductive under such conditions. Now, the second thing I would like to add is that I think that one should realize that, ecologically, farming was not only rain dependent farming, as we find it in Europe, but very early on serious wheat and barley farming was also successful in warmer places with the addition of irrigation water: the Jordan Rift Valley, som e areas in Mesopotamia — certainly some 1000 to 1500 years later in the main basin, and a little bit later on the Nile. I think that when we are talking about the establishment of farming in the east, then we are talking not so much about rain dependent farming, but on irrigation based agriculture, and the important fact to realize is that this started very, very early. If you ask me, I still cannot give you the answer to whether or not the initiation of wheat and barley domestication was due to the start o f irrigated
396 When Worlds Collide



Villar 397
agriculture, or vice versa, in places, let’s say, like the N ile Basin as far as Aswan, where we have the first indication of wheat domestication, which, if I remember correctly, is 7600 BC, or where, near Jericho, we find domesticated barley in the 8th millennium, and in the earlier part o f the 8th millennium BC there were cereals which were cultivated with or without the aid or irrigation. So this dichotomy in agriculture (rain dependent vs. irrigation dependent) is very, very early, and one should take it into account. Maybe those who are based in Europe are more impressed by types of farming which are typical for that ecological zone of the globe and not by the warmer fringe which was actually able to support very successful civilizations very early, at the beginning.
Eric P. Hamp: I would just like to perhaps strike a balance to som e of the statements which we have heard from Professor Renfrew. First o f all, I think that we have to give our predecessors their due on what they have said. I can illustrate this by seizing on a straight statement by Winfred Lehmann: I can only say from what I heard Professor Renfrew say that that statement reflects either ignorance or inattention. A knowing Indo-Europeanist, I think, who attends to his material at all would never have claimed this. Certainly, in the pages of Otto Schrader (b. 1855 - d. 1919: Redlleadkon der indogermanischen Altertumskunde, 1901), or som eone like that, you won't find any argument that the Indo-Europeans were pastoralists innocent o f agricultural matters. After all, in the debate about the IndoEuropean base *seHl- 'to sow, cast, let fall,' as we find it in English, for example, the argument is not whether the Indo-Europeans were agriculturalists, or ever planted anything, the question is rather - and Emmanuel Laroche has said the most decisive thing so far on this base which we find notably in every branch of Indo-European except Helleno-Armenian, whether the Indo-Europeans sowed by broadcast method, or whether they pushed seeds into the ground in planting that way. No one, in other words, doubts the mixed agricultural/pastoral economy that Indo-European reconstructions, at least from the linguistic point of view, leads to. Secondly, you mentioned that we must imagine Europe as comprised of not just a few dialects yielding the few branches that we happen to have by the historical accident of writing, things that you have already alluded to in the case of Anatolia, but rather that there should be a relatively unknowable number of possible fragmentations o f groups. Every Indo-Europeanist that I know o f who thinks at all about how languages develop and break up takes that as axiomatic. W e must imagine that Europe in, let's say, 2000 BC was a speckle of potential groups, probably three quarters of which failed to survive, just as has happened in more recent times and is happening yet today. After all, in every nation we know, in every area, and under no matter what conditions, we have dialects dying off, being gobbled up by others. This is the history of Aragon in Castile in one social setting; the history of things in the Hindu Kush with its little languages around; and so on. This is what we must understand as the natural state of affairs. Then, if I understood correctly, you suggested that Celtic sprang from some widespread uniformity. That's unrealistic from anything we know about languages simply because it is almost impossible, particularly if you have slower transportation than in modern times. It’s almost impossible to get a uniform language variety spread over a large territory, unless there is a mechanism to carry it back and forth. The Algonquians provide us with a good model for having widespread uniformity, but then we also know that they were widespread, and this might have been true o f the Celts at



398 When Worlds Collide
som e point, overlaying other groups. W e know, for instance, that certain Algonquian tribes in Quebec form a population that for several centuries now has filtered back and forth, across and through, French Canadian farmers. The Cree, o f course, occupy a large territory: they have a dialect extent from Labrador to the Rocky Mountains, but they have a considerable dialectology. To get something like a Celtic family describable as we have it, you have to get that coming from a small compact area of people, which perhaps have been but one among ten other varieties. W e don’t deny that there may have been other para-Celts, if you like, around, nine out of ten of which all died off.
Colin Renfrew: First of all, the point about fragmentation is agreed. I only made that point in response to a remark that Tim Champion made. I think we are all agreed that there was great variety in the languages that have died out. That’s not the original point anyway. It is simply that I think Tim Champion thought I hadn’t sufficiently emphasized it in my book, and I accept that, and I think we’re agreed on that. On the question of the emphasis which historical linguists and archaeologists have put on the pastoral, rather than on the agricultural, I’m very surprised that Professor Hamp doesn’t have this impression. Wherever I read in historical linguistics or, indeed, in archaeology about the Indo-Europeans, we keep on being told that the Indo-Europeans are pastoralists. And why is this? W ell, the only reason for thinking of them as pastoralists is som e inferences made from the proto-lexicon, and if we’re all happy to abandon the notion that they were pastoralists, well, I’m the first to be happy to abandon the notion also. So that is absolutely fine by me.
Tom Markey: There seems to be a bias here that says that any hunting and gathering culture is fragile, but, with reference to your agrarian "Wave of Advance” model, once you’ve achieved agriculture, then you’re on the way, and all that follows is the steady onslaught of agriculture: there’s never a need for price supports, never a crop failure, and never a dust bowl effect. There seem to be no glitches in the system. But, in fact, we know that even in the United States, where agriculture is a massive, technologically refined industry and supposedly highly sophisticated, it is actually very, very fragile. Such fragilities may, indeed, have opened the door to the sort of social gloss subsumed by Antonio Gilman’s Mafia Hypothesis. This was a fragility to be protected, and one had to husband one’s limited resources from time to time.
Colin Renfrew: These are different points, I think, from the ones which Professor Hamp and I were discussing.
Tom Markey: No, not really, as I am trying to provide a rationale for a mixed pastoral/agricultural economy. This crop failed, so let’s now do a little nomadic pastoralism, and, should that fail, then let’s return to agriculture.
Colin Renfrew: The point was about the Indo-Europeans having been originally pastoralists, and I was simply asserting that that seems to be a widespread preconception, but if it isn’t a widespread preconception, and perhaps I’m wrong in this, then I’m very happy to abandon it. Again, I’m not saying they were pastoralists, but I am indeed suggesting that they were agriculturalist. However, I think that agriculturalists suffered their vicissitudes, and they have their environmental disasters. A t the same time, there are a few cases I can think o f where significant tracts of the



Villar 399
world have gone over to an agricultural economy and then moved back from that to a hunting/gathering economy.
Eric P. Hamp: The Maya.
Colin Renfrew: There you’ve got a collapse o f a civilization, not of an agricultural society. They’re still living by agricultural products. It’s simply that there you’ve got a collapse o f a state society. It’s not a case where the present occupants of Maya lands are hunter/gatherers, for many of them are not. I’d like to speak to the Celtic point, and then I’ll surrender the floor again. The notion that Celts had to com e from a very compact homeland is obviously a linguistic issue where I don’t have the standing to speak, but it seem s to me that if the IndoEuropeans have dispersed from a compact homeland, then, on the basis of that model, in France and adjacent lands you would no doubt have people speaking a range of dialects who shared a common origin. Then one has to arrive at the crystallization, as it were, of languages which we now think of as Celtic languages. I think that Antonio Tovar (’Indogermanisch, Keltisch, Keltiberisch’, in Karl Horst Schmidt (ed.), Indogermanisch and Keltiberisch, Wiesbaden: Ludwig Reichert, 44-66) wrote about this, I thought effectively. If every time we have a language emerging, it always has to emerge from a restricted geographical area, then, to be sure, that’s a limiting model and surely we can expect the same language being spoken with essentially the same ranges o f dialects, and then surely we are talking ourselves into a very restricted approach spatially.
A lice Harris: In giving your talk, you mentioned that you thought that there was no conflict between Map 1 (fig. 7.7 in Colin Renfrew, Archaeology and Language. The Puzzle o f Indo-European Origins. London: Jonathan Cape, 1987. P. 160) and Diagram One that Professor Hamp has set up for subgrouping. I wonder, then, how, in fact, do you reconcile the two? From your map it looks as though Italic developed out of Greek, and Balto-Slavic developed out of Greek, and Germanic developed out o f BaltoSlavic, and Celtic out o f Germanic. Now, there are a lot o f things we don’t know very clearly in linguistics, and there are a lot o f details about subgrouping that are in conflict, but there is one thing that we can really be sure of in linguistics and that is the overall subgrouping picture, and it’s pretty clear that Italic didn’t develop out of Greek.
Colin Renfrew: First o f all, one thing that I’m not quite at ease with in the matters we discussed this morning, and that’s Prehellenic. I think we were to call it Pelasgian, but I think when you look at the map, one really has to imagine....
Eric P. Hamp: It’s Pelasgian, by which I avoid arguments with my Albanian friends.
Colin Renfrew: W ell, I see. Thank you very much. I think if we’re looking at the map, one really has to imagine the time depth, imagine this for whatever model is used for the development of the Indo-European languages from a homeland. There are limitations. You start with an apex, as it were, and there you have Proto-Anatolian spoken by their ancestors just a couple of generations ago in Anatolia. And then quite rapidly you have people moving into the Balkans and into Central Europe by well before 5000 BC, people who were no doubt speaking related languages. Now, the

Greek language would emerge millennia later from that source, so that when we look at Professor Hamp’s diagram, right at the apex we have a point of source from which, ultimately, the later Anatolian languages are derived. Then com es the next divergence. On the one hand we have the European languages and Greek, while on the other hand we have Indian and Iranian. That is fine, and that divides a divergent east and west. Then, very appropriately, we have Armenian diverging off, which in terms of the spatial logic o f the model I’m putting forth, is the ancestor of Armenian. On the other hand, we have the ancestor of Greek, and then further down com es the next divergence, which is a single point divergence as given on this diagram and which gives the various languages of Europe. So there is no suggestion that they share, which includes the ancestor o f Greek.
A lice Harris: But it’s the European part that I was focusing on, not the part to the east; it’s the part beginning with Greece, as I don’t think the parts you took care of are a problem. It’s the parts after that.
Colin Renfrew: W ell, on Professor Hamp’s diagram we have Armenian out of the discussion for the moment, would therefore be around 6500 BC in Greece, where this is the interesting thing, and either I may be right or I may be wrong, but it’s concrete: in G reece around 6500 BC you had people speaking what is still a Proto-Indo-European language, and then some o f them stayed there.
Eric P. Hamp: Why in Greece?
Colin Renfrew: W ell, let me answer my point while I’m giving you an idea, and you can question whether it’s right or not. Some of them stayed there and their descendants continued to speak the languages that developed into the Greek language. Meanwhile, and here the focus moves a little further, at this point you now have the ancestor to the remaining languages of Europe. So, I think that simply all I’m saying is that there is no error in logic there: had Professor Hamp given a more complicated tree arrangement, rather than emerging from a single point there, I might have been able to have them match up, but he was making a general point, and so, too, am I and there is really no conflict in logic.
Eric P. Hamp: No. May I just make two corrections in the interpretations? First of all, that diagram (Diagram One) is not a branching diagram of geographic location at all. It is a diagram of the abstract logic that returns reconstructions, so that actually that point where the Greeks and all those other languages are together, that might, for all we know, have been in Turkestan, let’s say, and it denotes a possible divergence anywhere, including Mars. However, there was a time after som e people had departed you might say, when there was a common language. So they weren’t necessarily Greeks.
Colin Renfrew: But it doesn’t exclude that they were in Greece, and it is still conceivable that they were in Greece.
Eric P. Hamp: No, because my diagram is independent of geography. And the second correction is that I do not make these directions so to speak obligingly: I refuse to

make branching nodes until I have evidence of how they branch. Unfortunately, in som e instances, I can only branch one or two very tentatively, otherwise I’d say that we don’t yet know how to subbranch.
Colin Renfrew: W ell, that’s the only reason I’m able to give an answer to Dr. Harris.
A lice Harris: But your arrows suggest otherwise.
Colin Renfrew: No, I don’t think that’s fair. The arrows are showing, if you like, the movement of what are still Proto-Indo-European speakers across Europe, and that’s all those arrows are indicating. They’re not suggesting that Greek is ancestral to Bulgarian or something. They are saying, and they’re saying this in quite concrete terms, that we have Proto-IndoEuropean speakers in Greece who are in fact ancestral to Proto-Indo-European speakers in the Balkans, who are ancestral to Proto-Indo-European speakers in central Europe. In each case there will no doubt be som e linguistic transformations through time which will be part of the process which leads to languages that are later observed. Concerning any of the models that have been offered for the ^origin o f the IndoEuropean languages, when you get down to concrete terms, then the relationships between languages as observed by lunguists do not in fact correlate very well with the geography of their ultimate location. That is a general difficulty which I think we all face.
