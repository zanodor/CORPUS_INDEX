Gold foil with small loop to attach to clothing is archaeological evidence for trefoil on Mohenjo-daro priest's garment
The archaeological evidence of this gold foil which can be attached to clothing matches with the description in ancient Veda text of investiture ceremony of Rtvij 'priest' who performs a yajna. Details of the text are presented. See details in Indus Script documents trefoil, three metal
buttons, investiture of Rtvij priest traidhâtavî (iṣṭi) who performed yajna -- शतपथ-ब्राह्मण 13.2.10 (Full text) https://tinyurl.com/ycul3ac8
A button or sequin made of thin gold foil with a small interior loop for attachment to clothing. This piece was found crumpled into a small wad, possibly in preparation for remelting to make a new ornament. (H2000-4445/2212-01, Mound E, Trench 54).
The discovery of this gold foil button gives a clue to decipherment of the trefoil sewed on the shawl of Mohenjo-daro priest. A priest's garment is endowed with such sewn metal coins in an ancient Veda text. I have suggested that gold, copper, silver buttons of this type were attached to the upper garment of the Mohenjo-daro priest to create the single foil, two foil and trefoil decorations on the garment. This proves that Mohenjo-daro is a purifer priest mentioned in Veda tradition. He is called Potr, cognate with potadara, poddar 'assayer of metals' in the country's tradition.

I submit that archaeological evidence of the gold foil and the priest statue with a uniquely decorated clothing matches with ancient Veda text and is conclusive proof for decipherment of the 'dotted circle' hieroglyph of Indus Script Corpora.
