Man
and his Symbols
conceived and edited by
Carl G.Jung



The first and only work in which C a r l G. Jung, the world-famous Swiss psychologist, explains to the general reader his greatest contribution to our knowledge of the human mind: the theory of the importance of symbolism—particularly as revealed in dreams.
Man and his
Symbols
Carl G.Jung
But for a dream, this book would never have been written. That dream — described by John Freeman in the Foreword—convinced Jung that he could, indeed should, explain his ideas to those who have no special knowledge of psychology. At the age of eighty-three, Jung worked out the complete plan for this book, including the sections that he wished his four closest associates to write. He devoted the closing months of his life to editing the work and writing his own key section, which he completed only ten days before his death. Throughout the book, Jung emphasizes that man can achieve wholeness only through a knowledge and acceptance of the unconscious—a knowledge acquired through dreams and their symbols. Every dream is a direct, personal, and meaningful communication to the dreamer—a communication that uses the symbols common to all mankind but uses them always in an entirely individual way, which can be interpreted only by an entirely individual key.

Introduction: John Freeman
The origins of this book are sufficiently unusual to be of interest, and they bear a direct relation to its contents and what it sets out to do. So let me tell you just how it came to be written. One day in the spring of 1959 the British Broadcasting Corporation invited me to interview for British television Dr. Carl Gustav J u n g . The interview was to be done "in depth." I knew little enough at that time about J u n g and his work, and I at once went to make his acquaintance at his beautiful lakeside home near Zurich. That was the beginning of a friendship that m e a n t a great deal to me a n d , I hope, gave some pleasure to J u n g in the last years of his life. T h e television interview has no further place in this story, except that it was accounted successful and that this book is by an odd c o m b i n a t i o n of circumstances an endproduct of that success. One man who saw Jung on the screen was Wolfgang Foges, managing director of Aldus Books. Foges h a d been keenly interested in the development of modern psychology since his childhood, when he lived near the Freuds in Vienna. And as he watched J u n g talking about his life a n d w o r k a n d ideas, Foges s u d d e n l y reflected w h a t a pity it was that, while the general outline of Freud's work was well known to educated readers all over the Western world, J u n g had never managed to break t h r o u g h to the general public a n d was always considered too difficult for popular reading. Foges, in fact, is the c r e a t o r of Man and his Symbols. H a v i n g sensed from the T V screen that a w a r m personal relation existed between Jung and myself, he asked me whether I would join him in trying to persuade J u n g to set out some of his more important and basic ideas in language and at a length that would be intelligible and interesting to non-specialist adult readers. I j u m p e d at the idea and set off once more to Zurich, d e t e r m i n e d that I could convince J u n g of the value and importance of such a work. J u n g listened to me in his garden for two hours almost without interruption — and then said no. He said it in the nicest possible way, but with great firmness; he had never in the past tried to popularize his work, and he wasn't sure that he could successfully d o so n o w ; a n y w a y , he was old a n d r a t h e r tired a n d not keen to take on such a long commitment about which he had so many doubts.
Jung's friends will all agree with me that he was a m a n of most positive decision. He would weigh up a problem with care and without

h u r r y ; b u t w h e n h e did give his a n s w e r , it was usually final. I r e t u r n e d to London greatly disappointed, but convinced that Jung's refusal was the end of the matter. So it might have been, but for two intervening factors that I had not foreseen. O n e was the pertinacity of Foges, who insisted on making one more approach to J u n g before accepting defeat. The other was an event that, as I look back on it, still astonishes me. The television program was, as I have said, accounted successful. It brought J u n g a great many letters from all sorts of people, many of them ordinary folk with no medical or psychological training, who had been captivated by the commanding presence, the humor, and the modest charm of this very great man, and who had glimpsed in his view of life a n d h u m a n personality s o m e t h i n g that could be helpful to them. And J u n g was very pleased, not simply at getting letters (his mail was enormous at all times) but at getting them from people who would normally have no contact with him. It was at this moment that he dreamed a dream of the greatest importance to him. (And as you read this book, you will understand just how important that can be.) He dreamed that, instead of sitting in his study and talking to the great doctors and psychiatrists who used to call on him from all over the world, he was standing in a public place and addressing a multitude of people who were listening to him with r a p t a t t e n t i o n a n d understanding what he said. . . .
When, a week or two later, Foges renewed his request that J u n g should undertake a new book designed, not for the clinic or the philosopher's study, but for the people in the market place, J u n g allowed himself to be persuaded. He laid down two conditions. First, that the book should not be a single-handed book, but the collective effort of himself and a group of his closest followers, through whom he had attempted to perpetuate his methods and his teaching. Secondly, that I should be entrusted with the task of co-ordinating the work and resolving any problems that might arise between the authors and the publishers. Lest it should seem that this introduction transgresses the bounds of reasonable modesty, let me say at once that I was gratified by this second condition — but within measure. For it very soon came to my knowledge that J u n g ' s reason for selecting me was essentially that he
I ()



regarded me as being of reasonable, but not exceptional, intelligence and without the slightest serious knowledge of psychology. Thus I was to J u n g the "average reader" of this book; what I could understand would be intelligible to all who would be interested; what I boggled at m i g h t possibly b e too difficult or o b s c u r e for s o m e . N o t u n d u l y flattered by this estimate of my role, I have none the less scrupulously insisted (sometimes, I fear, to the exasperation of the authors) on having every p a r a g r a p h written a n d , if necessary, rewritten to a degree of clarity and directness that enables me to say with confidence that this book in its entirety is designed for a n d addressed to the general reader, and that the complex subjects it deals with are treated with a rare and encouraging simplicity. After much discussion, the comprehensive subject of this book was agreed to be M a n and his Symbols; and J u n g himself selected as his collaborators in the work Dr. Marie-Louise von Franz of Zurich, perhaps his closest professional confidante and friend; Dr. Joseph L. Henderson of San Francisco, one of the most prominent and trusted of American J u n g i a n s ; Mrs. Aniela Jaffe of Zurich, who, in addition to being an experienced analyst, was Jung's confidential private secretary and his biographer; and Dr. J o l a n d e Jacobi, who after J u n g himself is the most e x p e r i e n c e d a u t h o r a m o n g J u n g ' s Z u r i c h circle. T h e s e four people were chosen partly because of their skill and experience in the particular subjects allocated to them and partly because all of them were completely trusted by J u n g to work unselfishly to his instructions as members of a team. J u n g ' s personal responsibility was to plan the structure of the whole book, to supervise and direct the work of his collaborators, and himself to write the keynote chapter, "Approaching the Unconscious."
The last year of his life was devoted almost entirely to this book, and when he died in J u n e 1961, his own section was complete (he finished it, in fact, o n l y s o m e 10 days before his final illness) a n d his colleagues' chapters had all been approved by him in draft. After his death, Dr. von Franz assumed over-all responsibility for the completion of the book in accordance with Jung's express instructions. T h e subject matter of Man and his Symbols a n d its o u t l i n e w e r e therefore laid d o w n and in d e t a i l — b y J u n g . T h e c h a p t e r t h a t bears his n a m e is his work and (apart from some fairly extensive editing to improve its intelligi
11



bility to the general reader) nobody else's. It was written, incidentally, in English. The remaining chapters were written by the various authors to J u n g ' s d i r e c t i o n a n d u n d e r his supervision. T h e final e d i t i n g of the complete work after Jung's death has been done by Dr. von Franz with a patience, understanding, and good humor that leave the publishers and myself greatly in her debt. Finally as to the contents of the book itself: Jung's thinking has colored the world of modern psychology more than many of those with casual knowledge realize. Such familiar terms, for instance, as "extravert," "introvert," and "archetype" are all Jungian concepts—borrowed and sometimes misused by others. But his o v e r w h e l m i n g c o n t r i b u t i o n to psychological u n d e r s t a n d i n g is his concept of the unconscious—not (like the unconscious of Freud) merely a sort of glory-hole of repressed desires, b u t a world t h a t is just as m u c h a vital a n d real part of the life of an individual as the conscious, "cogitating" world of the ego, and infinitely wider and richer. T h e language and the "people" of the unconscious are symbols, and the means of communications dreams.
T h u s a n e x a m i n a t i o n of M a n a n d his S y m b o l s is in effect a n e x a m i nation of man's relation to his own unconscious. And since in Jung's view the unconscious is the great guide, friend, a n d adviser of the conscious, this book is r e l a t e d in the most direct t e r m s to the s t u d y of human beings and their spiritual problems. We know the unconscious and communicate with it (a two-way service) principally by dreams; and all through this book (above all in Jung's own chapter) you will find a q u i t e r e m a r k a b l e e m p h a s i s p l a c e d o n the i m p o r t a n c e of d r e a m ing in the life of the individual. It would be an impertinence on my part to attempt to interpret Jung's work to readers, many of whom will surely be far better qualified to u n d e r s t a n d it t h a n I a m . M y role, r e m e m b e r , was m e r e l y to serve as a sort of "intelligibility filter" a n d by n o m e a n s as a n interpreter. Nevertheless, I venture to offer two general points that seem important to me as a layman and that may possibly be helpful to other n o n - e x p e r t s . T h e first is a b o u t d r e a m s . T o J u n g i a n s the d r e a m is n o t a kind of standardized cryptogram that can be decoded by a glossary of symbol meanings. It is a n integral, i m p o r t a n t , a n d personal expression of the individual unconscious. It is just as " r e a l " as a n y other
I2



p h e n o m e n o n a t t a c h i n g to the i n d i v i d u a l . The, d r e a m e r ' s i n d i v i d u a l unconscious is c o m m u n i c a t i n g with t h e d r e a m e r a l o n e a n d is selecting symbols for its purpose that have meaning to the dreamer and to nobody else. Thus the interpretation of dreams, whether by the analyst or by the d r e a m e r himself, is for the J u n g i a n psychologist a n entirely personal and individual business (and sometimes an experimental and very lengthy one as well) that can by no means be undertaken by rule of thumb. T h e converse of this is t h a t the c o m m u n i c a t i o n s of the unconscious are of the highest importance to the dreamer—naturally so, since the unconscious is at least half of his total b e i n g — a n d frequently offer him advice or guidance that could be obtained from no other source. Thus, when I described Jung's dream about addressing the multitude, I was not describing a piece of magic or suggesting that J u n g dabbled in fortune telling. I was recounting in the simple terms of daily experience how J u n g was "advised" by his own unconscious to reconsider an inadequate judgment he had made with the conscious part of his mind. Now it follows from this t h a t the d r e a m i n g of d r e a m s is not a m a t t e r that the well-adjusted J u n g i a n can regard as simply a matter of chance. On the contrary, the ability to establish communications with the unconscious is a p a r t of the whole m a n , a n d J u n g i a n s " t e a c h " themselves (I can think of no better term) to be receptive to dreams. When, therefore, J u n g himself1 was faced with the critical decision whether or not to write this book, he was able to draw on the resources of both his conscious a n d his unconscious in m a k i n g u p his m i n d . A n d all t h r o u g h this book you will find the d r e a m t r e a t e d as a direct, personal, and meaningful communication to the dreamer —a communication that uses the symbols c o m m o n to ajl mankind, but that uses them on every occasion in an entirely individual way that can be interpreted only by an entirely individual "key." T h e second p o i n t I wish to m a k e is a b o u t a p a r t i c u l a r characteristic of a r g u m e n t a t i v e m e t h o d t h a t is c o m m o n to all the writers of this book perhaps to all Jungians. Those who have limited themselves to living entirely in the world of the conscious and who reject communication with the unconscious bind themselves by the laws of conscious, formal life. With the infallible (but often meaningless) logic of the algebraic equation, they argue from assumed premises to incontestably deduced
'3



conclusions. J u n g and his colleagues seem to me (whether they know it or not) to reject the limitations of this m e t h o d of a r g u m e n t . It is not that they ignore logic, but they appear all the time to be arguing to the unconscious as well as to the conscious. T h e i r dialectical m e t h o d is itself symbolic and often devious. They convince not by means of the narrowly focused spotlight of the syllogism, but by skirting, by repetition, by presenting a recurring view of the same subject seen each time from a slightly different angle — until suddenly the reader who has never b e e n a w a r e of a single, conclusive m o m e n t of p r o o f finds t h a t he has unknowingly embraced and taken into himself some wider truth. J u n g ' s arguments (and those of his colleagues) spiral upward over his subject like a bird circling a tree. At first, near the ground, it sees only a confusion of leaves and branches. Gradually, as it circles higher and higher, the recurring aspects of the tree form a wholeness and relate to their surroundings. Some readers may find this "spiraling" method of a r g u m e n t obscure or even confusing for a few pages—but not, I t h i n k , for long. I t is c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of J u n g ' s m e t h o d , a n d very soon the r e a d e r will find it c a r r y i n g h i m w i t h it o n a persuasive a n d profoundly absorbing journey. T h e different sections of this book speak for themselves and require little introduction from me. Jung's own chapter introduces the reader to the unconscious, to the archetypes and symbols that form its language and to the dreams by which it communicates. Dr. Henderson in the following chapter illustrates the appearance of several archetypal patterns in ancient mythology, folk legend, and primitive ritual. Dr. von Franz, in the chapter entitled " T h e Process of Individuation," describes the process by which the conscious and the unconscious within an individual learn to know, respect, and accommodate one another. In a certain sense this c h a p t e r contains not only the crux of the whole book, but perhaps the essence of Jung's philosophy of life: Man becomes whole, integrated, calm, fertile, and happy when (and only w h e n ) t h e process of i n d i v i d u a t i o n is c o m p l e t e , w h e n t h e conscious and the unconscious have learned to live at peace and to comp l e m e n t o n e a n o t h e r . M r s . Jaffe, like D r . H e n d e r s o n , is c o n c e r n e d with demonstrating, in the familiar fabric of the conscious, man's recurring interest in—almost obsession with — the symbols of the unconscious. They have for him a profoundly significant, almost a nour
14



ishing and sustaining, inner attraction — whether they occur in the myths and fairy tales that Dr. Henderson analyzes or in the visual arts, which, as Mrs. Jaffe shows, satisfy and delight us by a constant appeal to the unconscious. Finally, I must say a brief word about Dr. Jacobi's chapter, which is s o m e w h a t s e p a r a t e from the rest of the book. It is in fact a n a b b r e viated case history of one interesting and successful analysis. T h e value of such a c h a p t e r in a book like this is o b v i o u s ; b u t two words of w a r n ing are nevertheless necessary. First, as Dr. von Franz points out, there is no such t h i n g as a typical J u n g i a n analysis. T h e r e c a n ' t b e , because every d r e a m is a private a n d individual c o m m u n i c a t i o n , a n d no two dreams use the symbols of the unconscious in the same way. So every J u n g i a n analysis is u n i q u e — a n d it is m i s l e a d i n g to consider this o n e , taken from D r . J a c o b i ' s clinical files (or a n y o t h e r o n e t h e r e has ever been), as "representative" or "typical." All one can say of the case of Henry a n d his sometimes lurid d r e a m s is t h a t they form one true example of the way in which the Jungian method may be applied to a particular case. Secondly, the full history of even a comparatively uncomplicated case would take a whole book to recount. Inevitably, the story of Henry's analysis suffers a little in compression. The references, for instance, to t h e / Ching h a v e b e e n s o m e w h a t o b s c u r e d a n d lent a n u n n a t u r a l ( a n d to m e unsatisfactory) flavor of the occult b y b e i n g p r e sented out of their full context. Nevertheless, we c o n c l u d e d — a n d I am sure the reader will agree — that, with the warnings duly given, the clarity, to say nothing of the h u m a n interest, of Henry's analysis greatly enriches this book.
I b e g a n b y d e s c r i b i n g h o w J u n g c a m e to w r i t e Man and his Symbols. I end by reminding the reader of what a remarkable — perhaps unique —publication this is. Carl Gustav J u n g was one of the great doctors of all time a n d one of the great thinkers of this century. His object always was to h e l p m e n a n d w o m e n to k n o w themselves, so t h a t b y self-knowledge and thoughtful self-use they could lead full, rich, and happy lives. At the very end of his own life, which was as full, rich, and happy as any I have encountered, he decided to use the strength that was left him to address his message to a w i d e r public t h a n he h a d ever tried to reach before. H e completed his task a n d his life in the same month. This book is his legacy to the b r o a d r e a d i n g public.

Approaching the unconscious
Carl G. Jung
The entrance to the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Rameses III






Approaching the unconscious
The importance of dreams
M a n uses the spoken or written word to express the meaning of what he wants to convey. His l a n g u a g e is full of symbols, but he also often employs signs or images that are not strictly descriptive. Some arc mere abbreviations or strings of initials, such as U N , U N I C E F , or U N E S C O ; others are familiar trade marks, the names of patent medicines, badges, or insignia. Although these are meaningless in themselves, they have acquired a recognizable meaning through common usage or deliberate intent. Such things are not symbols. They are signs, and they do no more than denote the objects to which they are attached.
W h a t w e call a s y m b o l is a t e r m , a n a m e , or even a picture that m a y be familiar in daily life, yet that possesses specific connotations in addition to its conventional and obvious meaning. It implies something vague, unknown, or hidden from us. M a n y Cretan m o n u m e n t s , for instance, arc marked with the design of the
d o u b l e a d z e . T h i s is a n object t h a t we know, but we do not know its symbolic implications. For another example, take the case of the Indian who, after a visit to England, told his friends at home that the English worship animals, because he had found eagles, lions, and oxen in old churches. He was not aware (nor are many Christians) that these animals are symbols of the Evangelists a n d a r e derived from the vision of Ezekiel, and that this in turn has an analogy to the Egyptian sun god Horus and his four sons. There are, moreover, such objects as the wheel and the cross that are known all over the world, yet that have a symbolic significance u n d e r c e r t a i n c o n d i t i o n s . Precisely w h a t they symbolize is still a m a t t e r for controversial speculation.
T h u s a w o r d or a n i m a g e is symbolic w h e n it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning. It has a wider "uncons c i o u s " aspect t h a t is never precisely defined or



fully explained. N o r c a n o n e h o p e to define or explain it. As the mind explores the symbol, it is led to ideas t h a t lie b e y o n d the g r a s p of reason. T h e wheel may lead our thoughts toward the concept of a " d i v i n e " sun, but at this point reason must admit its incompetence; man is unable to define a " d i v i n e " b e i n g . W h e n , with all our intellectual limitations, we call something " d i v i n e , " we have merely given it a name, which may be based on a creed, but never on factual evidence. Because there are innumerable things beyond the range of h u m a n understanding, we constantly use symbolic terms to represent concepts that we cannot define or fully c o m p r e h e n d . This is one reason w h y all religions e m p l o y symbolic language or images. But this conscious use of symbols is only o n e aspect of a psychological fact of great i m p o r t a n c e : M a n also p r o d u c e s symbols unconsciously a n d spontaneously, in the form of d r e a m s .
Left, three of the four Evangelists (in a relief on Chartres Cathedral) appear as animals: The lion is Mark, the ox Luke, the eagle John. Also animals are three of the sons of the Egyptian god Horus (above, c. 1 250 B.C.), Animals, and groups of four, are universal religious symbols.
It is not easy to g r a s p this point. But the point must be grasped if we are to know more about the ways in which the h u m a n mind works. M a n , as we realize if we reflect for a moment, never perceives anything fully or comprehends anything completely. He can see, hear, touch, and taste; but how far he sees, how well he hears, what his touch tells him, and what he tastes depend upon the n u m b e r and quality of his senses. These limit his perception of the world a r o u n d him. By using scientific instruments he can partly compensate for the deficiencies of his senses. For example, he can extend the range of his vision by binoculars or of his hearing by electrical amplification. But the most elaborate apparatus cannot do more than bring distant or small objects within range of his eyes, or make faint sounds more audible. No matter what instruments he uses, at some point he r e a c h e s the e d g e of c e r t a i n t y b e y o n d w h i c h conscious knowledge cannot pass.

In many societies, representations of the sun express man's indefinable religious experience. Above, a decoration on the back of a throne belonging to the 14th-century B.C. Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen is dominated by a sun disk; the hands at the end of the rays symbolize the sun's life-giving power. Left, a monk in 20th-century Japan prays before a mirror that represents the divine Sun in the Shinto religion.
Right, tungsten atoms seen with a microscope that magnifies 2,000,000 times. Far right, the spots in center of picture are the farthest visible galaxies. No matter how far man extends his senses, limits to his conscious perception remain.



There are, moreover, unconscious aspects of our p e r c e p t i o n of r e a l i t y . T h e first is t h e fact that even when our senses react to real phenomena, sights, and sounds, they are somehow translated from the realm of reality into that of the m i n d . W i t h i n t h e m i n d t h e y b e c o m e psychic events, w h o s e u l t i m a t e n a t u r e is u n knowable (for the psyche c a n n o t k n o w its o w n psychical substance). T h u s every experience contains an indefinite n u m b e r of u n k n o w n factors, not to speak of the fact t h a t every c o n c r e t e object is a l w a y s u n k n o w n in c e r t a i n r e s p e c t s , because we cannot know the ultimate n a t u r e of matter itself.
Then there are certain events of which we have not consciously taken note; they have remained, so to speak, below the threshold of consciousness. T h e y h a v e h a p p e n e d , but they have been absorbed s u b l i m i n a l l y , w i t h o u t o u r conscious k n o w l e d g e . W e c a n b e c o m e a w a r e of such h a p p e n i n g s o n l y in a m o m e n t of i n t u i t i o n or by a process of p r o f o u n d t h o u g h t t h a t leads to a later r e a l i z a t i o n t h a t t h e y m u s t h a v e h a p pened; and though we may have originally ignored their e m o t i o n a l a n d vital i m p o r t a n c e , it later wells u p from the unconscious as a sort of a f t e r t h o u g h t .
It m a y a p p e a r , for instance, in the form of a dream. As a general rule, the unconscious aspect of a n y e v e n t is r e v e a l e d to us in d r e a m s ,
w h e r e it a p p e a r s n o t as a r a t i o n a l t h o u g h t b u t as a s y m b o l i c i m a g e . As a m a t t e r of history, it was the s t u d y of d r e a m s that first e n a b l e d psychologists to investigate the unconscious aspect of conscious psychic events. It is o n s u c h e v i d e n c e t h a t psychologists assume the existence of an unconscious psyche —though many scientists and philosophers deny its existence. T h e y a r g u e naively that such an assumption implies the existence of two "subj e c t s , " or (to p u t it in a c o m m o n phrase) two personalities within the same individual. But this is e x a c t l y w h a t it d o e s i m p l y — q u i t e corr e c t l y . A n d it is o n e of t h e c u r s e s of m o d e r n m a n that m a n y people suffer from this divided p e r s o n a l i t y .

Quite apart, therefore, from the evidence that medical research has accumulated, there are strong g r o u n d s of logic for rejecting statements like " T h e r e is n o u n c o n s c i o u s . " T h o s e w h o say s u c h things merely express an age-old "misoneism"
—a fear of the new and the unknown.

T h e r e are historical reasons for this resistance to the idea of an u n k n o w n part of the h u m a n psyche. C o n s c i o u s n e s s is a very r e c e n t acquisition of n a t u r e , a n d it is still in a n " e x p e r i m e n t a l " s t a t e . It is frail, m e n a c e d b y specific d a n gers, and easily injured. As anthropologists have noted, one of the most c o m m o n mental derangements that occur among primitive people is w h a t t h e y call " t h e loss o f a s o u l " — w h i c h means, as the n a m e indicates, a noticeable disruption (or, more technically, a dissociation) of consciousness.
A m o n g s u c h p e o p l e , w h o s e c o n s c i o u s n e s s is at a different level of development from ours, t h e " s o u l " (or p s y c h e ) is n o t felt to b e a u n i t . Many primitives assume that a man has a "bush soul" as well as his own, and that this b u s h soul is i n c a r n a t e in a w i l d a n i m a l o r a t r e e , with which the human individual has some kind of p s y c h i c i d e n t i t y . T h i s is w h a t t h e distinguished French ethnologist Lucien Levy-Briihl called a "mystical participation." He later retracted this term under pressure of adverse criticism, but I believe that his critics were w r o n g . It is a w e l l - k n o w n p s y c h o l o g i c a l fact
that an individual may have such an unconscious identity with some other person or object. This identity takes a variety of forms a m o n g p r i m i t i v e s . If t h e b u s h soul is t h a t of a n a n i m a l , t h e a n i m a l itself is c o n s i d e r e d as s o m e sort of b r o t h e r to t h e m a n . A m a n w h o s e b r o t h e r is a c r o c o d i l e , for i n s t a n c e , is s u p p o s e d to be safe w h e n s w i m m i n g a crocodile-infested river. If t h e b u s h soul is a t r e e , t h e t r e e is p r e s u m e d to have something like parental authority over the individual concerned. In both cases an injury to t h e b u s h soul is i n t e r p r e t e d as a n i n j u r y to the man. I n s o m e t r i b e s , it is a s s u m e d t h a t a m a n h a s a n u m b e r of souls; this belief expresses the feeling of some primitive individuals that they each consist of several linked but distinct units. This m e a n s t h a t t h e i n d i v i d u a l ' s p s y c h e is far from b e i n g safely s y n t h e s i z e d ; on the c o n t r a r y , it threatens to fragment only too easily under the onslaught of unchecked emotions.
W h i l e this s i t u a t i o n is f a m i l i a r t o us f r o m t h e s t u d i e s of a n t h r o p o l o g i s t s , it is n o t so i r r e l e v a n t to o u r o w n a d v a n c e d civilization as it m i g h t seem. W e too can b e c o m e dissociated a n d lose
"Dissociation" means a splitting in the psyche, causing a neurosis. A famous fictional example of this state is Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ( 1 8 8 6 ) by t h e S c o t s a u t h o r R. L Stevenson. In the story Jekyll's "split" took the form of a physical change, rather than (as in reality) an inner, psychic state. Left, Mr. Hyde (from the 1932 film of the story) —Jekyll's "other half."
Primitive people call dissociation "loss of a soul"; they believe that a man has a " b u s h s o u l " as w e l l as his own. Right, a Nyanga tribesman of west central Africa wearing a mask of the hornbill — the bird that he identifies with his bush soul.
Far right, telephonists on a busy switchboard handle many calls at once. In such jobs people "split off" parts of their conscious minds to concentrate. But this split is controlled and temporary, not a spontaneous, abnormal dissociation.

Beyond doubt, even in what we call a high level of civilization, h u m a n consciousness has not yet achieved a r e a s o n a b l e d e g r e e of continuity. It is still v u l n e r a b l e a n d l i a b l e t o f r a g mentation. This capacity to isolate part of one's mind, i n d e e d , is a v a l u a b l e c h a r a c t e r i s t i c . It enables us to c o n c e n t r a t e u p o n o n e t h i n g at a time, excluding everything else that m a y claim our a t t e n t i o n . But t h e r e is a w o r l d of d i f f e r e n c e between a conscious decision to split off a n d temporarily suppress a part of one's psyche, and a condition in which this h a p p e n s spontaneously, without one's k n o w l e d g e or consent a n d even against o n e ' s i n t e n t i o n .

T h u s , even in our day the unity of cons c i o u s n e s s is still a d o u b t f u l a f f a i r ; it c a n t o o easily be disrupted. An ability to control one's emotions that may be very desirable from one point of view would be a questionable accomplishment from a n o t h e r , for it would deprive social intercourse of varietv. color, and warmth.
It is a g a i n s t this b a c k g r o u n d t h a t w e m u s t review the importance of d r e a m s those flimsy, evasive, unreliable, vague, and uncertain fantasies. T o explain my point of view, I should like to d e s c r i b e h o w it d e v e l o p e d over a period of years, and how I was led to conclude that dreams are the most frequent and universally accessible source for the investigation of m a n ' s symbolizing faculty.
S i g m u n d F r e u d w a s t h e p i o n e e r w h o first tried to explore empirically the unconscious background of consciousness. He worked on the general assumption that dreams are not a matter of chance but are associated with conscious thoughts and problems. This assumption was not in the least arbitrary. It was based upon the
25



conclusion of e m i n e n t neurologists (for instance, Pierre Janet) that neurotic symptoms are related to some conscious experience. They even appear to be split-off areas of the conscious mind, which, at another time and under different conditions, can be conscious.
Before the beginning of this century, Freud and Josef Breuer had recognized that neurotic symptoms — hysteria, certain types of pain, and a b n o r m a l behavior—are in fact symbolically meaningful. T h e y are one way in which the u n c o n s c i o u s m i n d expresses itself, j u s t as it may in d r e a m s ; and they are equally symbolic. A p a t i e n t , for i n s t a n c e , w h o is c o n f r o n t e d w i t h an intolerable situation may develop a spasm whenever he tries to swallow: He "can't swallow it." U n d e r similar conditions of psychological stress, another patient has an attack of
asthma: He "can't breathe the atmosphere at h o m e . " A third suffers from a peculiar paralysis of the legs: H e c a n ' t walk, i.e. " h e c a n ' t go on any more." A fourth, who vomits when he eats, " c a n n o t digest" some unpleasant fact. I could cite m a n y examples of this kind, but such physical reactions are only one form in which the problems that trouble us unconsciously m a y express themselves. T h e y more often find expression in our dreams.
Any psychologist who has listened to numbers of people describing their dreams knows that dream symbols have much greater variety than the physical symptoms of neurosis. They often consist of elaborate and picturesque fantasies. B u t if t h e a n a l y s t w h o is c o n f r o n t e d b y this d r e a m material uses Freud's original techn i q u e o f " f r e e a s s o c i a t i o n , " h e finds t h a t d r e a m s

can eventually be reduced to certain basic patterns. This technique played an important part in the d e v e l o p m e n t of p s y c h o a n a l y s i s , for it enabled Freud to use dreams as the starting point from which the unconscious problem of the patient might be explored.
Freud made the simple but penetrating observation t h a t if a d r e a m e r is e n c o u r a g e d to g o o n talking about his d r e a m images a n d the thoughts that these p r o m p t in his mind, he will give himself away and reveal the unconscious background of his ailments, in both w h a t he says and what he deliberately omits saying. His ideas may seem irrational and irrelevant, but after a time it b e c o m e s r e l a t i v e l y easy to see w h a t it is that he is t r y i n g to a v o i d , w h a t u n p l e a s a n t thought or e x p e r i e n c e h e is s u p p r e s s i n g . N o matter how he tries to camouflage it, everything he says points to the core of his predicament. A doctor sees so m a n y things from the seamy side of life t h a t h e is s e l d o m far from t h e truth when he interprets the hints that his patient produces as signs of an uneasy conscience. W h a t he eventually discovers, unfortunately, confirms his expectations. T h u s far, nobody can say anything against Freud's theory of repression a n d wish fulfillment as a p p a r e n t causes of d r e a m symbolism.
Freud attached particular importance to dreams as the point of d e p a r t u r e for a process
of "free association." But after a time I began to feel t h a t this w a s a m i s l e a d i n g a n d i n a d e q u a t e use of the rich fantasies that the unconscious produces in sleep. M y doubts really began when a colleague told me of an experience he had during the course of a long train journey in Russia. Though he did not know the language and could not even decipher the Cyrillic script, he found himself musing over the strange letters in which the railway notices were written, and he fell i n t o a r e v e r i e in w h i c h h e i m a g i n e d all sorts of m e a n i n g s for t h e m .
O n e idea led to another, and in his relaxed mood he found that this "free association" had stirred up many old memories. Among them h e w a s a n n o y e d t o find s o m e l o n g - b u r i e d d i s agreeable topics things he had wished to forg e t a n d h a d f o r g o t t e n consciously. H e h a d i n fact arrived at what psychologists would call his " c o m p l e x e s " — that is, repressed emotional themes that can cause constant psychological disturbances or even, in m a n y cases, the symptoms of neurosis.
This e p i s o d e o p e n e d m v eves to the far! thai it w a s n o t necessary to use a d r e a m as t h e p o i n t of d e p a r t u r e for the process of "free association" if one wished to discover the complexes of a patient. It showed me that one can reach the center directly from any point of the compass. O n e could begin from Cyrillic letters, from

Right, the " i n k b l o t " test devised by the S w i s s p s y c h i a t r i s t H e r m a n n Rorschach. The shape of the blot can serve as a stimulus for free association; in fact, almost any irregular free shape can spark off the associative process. L e o n a r d o da Vinci w r o t e in his Notebooks: "It should not be hard for you to stop sometimes and look into the stains of walls, or ashes of a fire, or clouds, or m u d or like p l a c e s , in w h i c h . . . y o u m a y f i n d really marvelous ideas."



meditations upon a crystal ball, a prayer wheel, or a modern painting, or even from casual conversation about some quite trivial event. T h e d r e a m was n o m o r e a n d n o less useful in this respect than any other possible starting point. Nevertheless, dreams have a particular significance, even though they often arise from an emotional upset in which the habitual complexes are also involved. (The habitual complexes are the tender spots of the psyche, which react most quickly to an external stimulus or disturbance.) T h a t is w h y free a s s o c i a t i o n c a n l e a d o n e from any dream to the critical secret thoughts.
At this point, h o w e v e r , it o c c u r r e d to m e t h a t (if I was right so far) it m i g h t r e a s o n a b l y follow that dreams have some special and more significant f u n c t i o n o f t h e i r o w n . V e r y o f t e n d r e a m s have a definite, evidently purposeful structure, indicating an underlying idea or intention t h o u g h , as a r u l e , t h e l a t t e r is n o t i m m e d i a t e l y comprehensible. I therefore began to consider whether one should pay more attention to the actual form and content of a dream, rather than allowing ""free" association to lead one off through a train of ideas to complexes that could as easily be reached by other means.
This new thought was a turning point in the development of my psychology. It meant that I gradually gave up following associations that led far away from the text of a d r e a m . I chose to concentrate rather on the associations to the d r e a m itself, believing that the latter expressed something specific that the unconscious was trying to say.
T h e change in my attitude toward d r e a m s involved a change of method; the new tech

nique was one that could take account of all the various wider aspects of a dream. A story told by the conscious mind has a beginning, a d e v e l o p m e n t , a n d a n e n d , b u t t h e s a m e is n o t true of a dream. Its dimensions in time and space a r e q u i t e different; to u n d e r s t a n d it you m u s t e x a m i n e it from every a s p e c t — j u s t as y o u m a y take an u n k n o w n object in your hands and t u r n it o v e r a n d o v e r u n t i l y o u a r e f a m i l i a r with every detail of its shape.
Perhaps I have now said enough to show how I came increasingly to disagree with "free" a s s o c i a t i o n a s F r e u d first e m p l o y e d i t : I w a n t e d to k e e p as close as possible to the d r e a m itself, and to exclude all the irrelevant ideas and associations t h a t it m i g h t evoke. T r u e , these could lead one toward the complexes of a patient, but I h a d a m o r e far-reaching purpose in m i n d than the discovery of complexes that cause neurotic disturbances. There are many other means by which these can be identified: T h e psychologist, for instance, can get all the hints he needs by using word-association tests (by asking the patient what he associates to a given set of w o r d s , a n d b y s t u d y i n g h i s r e s p o n s e s ) . But to k n o w a n d u n d e r s t a n d the psychic life



process of an individual's whole personality, it is i m p o r t a n t t o r e a l i z e t h a t h i s d r e a m s a n d t h e i r symbolic images have a much more important role to play. Almost everyone knows, for example, that there is a n e n o r m o u s v a r i e t y o f i m a g e s b y w h i c h the sexual act can be symbolized (or, one might say, represented in the form of a n allegory). Each of these images c a n lead, by a process of association, to the idea of sexual intercourse and to specific c o m p l e x e s t h a t a n y i n d i v i d u a l m a y have about his o w n sexual attitudes. But o n e could just as well u n e a r t h such complexes by day-dreaming on a set of indecipherable Russian letters. I was thus led to the assumption that a dream can contain some message other than the sexual allegory, a n d t h a t it d o e s so for definite reasons. T o illustrate this point:
A man m a y d r e a m of inserting a key in a lock, of wielding a h e a v y stick, or of b r e a k i n g down a door with a battering ram. Each of these can be r e g a r d e d as a sexual allegory. But the fact that his u n c o n s c i o u s for its o w n p u r poses has chosen o n e of these specific i m a g e s it m a y be t h e k e y , t h e s t i c k , o r t h e b a t t e r i n g r a m is a l s o o f m a j o r s i g n i f i c a n c e . T h e r e a l task is to u n d e r s t a n d why t h e k e y h a s b e e n preferred to the stick, or the stick to the r a m . And sometimes this might even lead o n e to discover t h a t it is n o t t h e s e x u a l a c t a t all t h a t is represented, but some quite different psychological point.
From this line of reasoning, I concluded that only the m a t e r i a l t h a t is c l e a r l y a n d visibly p a r t of a d r e a m s h o u l d b e u s e d in i n t e r p r e t i n g it. The dream has its o w n limitation. Its specific

form itself tells us w h a t b e l o n g s to it a n d w h a t leads a w a y from it. While "free" association lures one away from that material in a kind of z i g z a g line, t h e m e t h o d I evolved is m o r e like a c i r c u m a m b u l a t i o n w h o s e c e n t e r is t h e d r e a m picture. I work all a r o u n d the d r e a m picture and disregard every attempt that the dreamer makes to break a w a y from it. T i m e and time again, in m y professional work, I have had to repeat the words: "Let's get back to your d r e a m . W h a t d o e s t h e dream s a y ? "
For instance, a patient of mine dreamed of a drunken and disheveled vulgar woman. In t h e d r e a m , it s e e m e d t h a t this w o m a n w a s his wife, t h o u g h in real life his wife w a s totally different. O n the surface, therefore, the dream was shockingly untrue, and the patient immed i a t e l y r e j e c t e d it as d r e a m n o n s e n s e . If I, as his doctor, had let him start a process of association, he would inevitably have tried to get as far away as possible from (he unpleasant suggestion of his dream. In that case, he would have ended with one of his staple complexes a complex, possibly, that had nothing to do with his wife and we should have learned nothing about the s p e c i a l m e a n i n g of t h i s p a r t i c u l a r d r e a m .



A key in a l o c k may be a s e x u a l symbol — but not invariably. Left, a section of an altarpiece by the 1 5th-century Flemish artist Campin. The door was intended to symbolize hope, the lock to symbolize charity, and the key to symbolize the desire for God. Below, a British bishop during the consecration of a church carries out a traditional ceremony by knocking on the church door with a s t a f f — w h i c h is o b v i o u s l y not a phallic symbol but a symbol of authority and the shepherd's crook. No individual symbolic image can be said to have a dogmatically fixed, generalized meaning.
The " a n i m a " is the f e m a l e e l e m e n t in the male unconscious. (It and the " a n i m u s " in the female unconscious are discussed in Chapter 3.) This inner duality is often s y m b o l i z e d by a hermaphroditic figure, like the crowned hermaphrodite, above right, from a 17th-century alchemical manuscript. Right, a physical image of man's psychic "bisexuality": a human cell w i t h its chromosomes. All organisms have t w o sets of chromosomes—one from each parent.

What, then, was his unconscious trying to convey by such an obviously untrue statement? Clearly, it s o m e h o w expressed t h e idea of a degenerate female who was closely connected with the d r e a m e r ' s life; but since the projection of this i m a g e o n to his wife w a s u n j u s t i f i e d a n d factually untrue, I had to look elsewhere before I found out w h a t this repulsive i m a g e represented.
In the Middle Ages, long before the physiologists d e m o n s t r a t e d t h a t by reason of o u r glandular structure there are both male and
female e l e m e n t s in all of us, it was said that "every man carries a woman within h i m s e l f It is this f e m a l e e l e m e n t in e v e r y m a l e t h a t I have called the "anima." This "feminine" a s p e c t is e s s e n t i a l l y a c e r t a i n i n f e r i o r k i n d of relatedness to the surroundings, and particularly to w o m e n , w h i c h is k e p t carefully c o n cealed from others as well as from oneself. In o t h e r words, t h o u g h an individual's visiblepersonality may seem quite normal, he may well be concealing from others or even from h i m s e l f — t h e d e p l o r a b l e c o n d i t i o n of " t h e woman within."
T h a t was the case with this particular patient: His female side was not nice. His d r e a m was actually saying to h i m : " Y o u are in some respects behaving like a degenerate female," and thus gave him an appropriate shock. (An example of this kind, of course, must not be taken as evidence that the unconscious is c o n c e r n e d w i t h " m o r a l " i n j u n c t i o n s . T h e dream was not telling the patient to "behave better," but was simply trying to balance the lopsided nature of his conscious mind, which was maintaining the fiction that he was a perfect gentleman throughout.)
It is easy to u n d e r s t a n d w h y d r e a m e r s t e n d to ignore and even deny the message of their dreams. Consciousness naturally resists anything unconscious and unknown. I have already pointed out the existence among primitive peoples of what anthropologists call "misoncism," a deep and superstitious fear of novelty. The primitives manifest all the reactions of the wild animal against untoward events. But "civilized" m a n reacts to new ideas in m u c h the same way, erecting psychological barriers to protect himself from the shock of facing something new. This can easily be observed in any individual's reaction to his own d r e a m s when obliged to admit a surprising thought. M a n y pioneers in philosophy, science, a n d even literature have been victims of the innate conserva t i s m of t h e i r c o n t e m p o r a r i e s . P s y c h o l o g y is o n e of the y o u n g e s t of the sciences; b e c a u s e it attempts to deal with the working of the unconscious, it has i n e v i t a b l y e n c o u n t e r e d misoneism in an extreme form.

Past and future in the unconscious
S o far, I h a v e b e e n s k e t c h i n g s o m e of t h e p r i n ciples on which I approached the problem of d r e a m s , for w h e n we w a n t to investigate m a n ' s faculty to produce symbols, dreams prove to be the most basic a n d accessible material for this purpose. T h e two fundamental points in dealing with dreams are these: First, the dream should be treated as a fact, about which one must make no previous assumption except that it s o m e h o w makes sense; a n d second, the d r e a m is a specific e x p r e s s i o n of t h e u n c o n s c i o u s .
One could scarcely put these principles more modestly. No matter how low anyone's opinion of the unconscious m a y be, he must concede t h a t it is w o r t h i n v e s t i g a t i n g ; t h e u n c o n s c i o u s is at least o n a level w i t h t h e l o u s e , w h i c h , after all, enjoys the honest interest of the entomolog i s t . If s o m e b o d y w i t h l i t t l e e x p e r i e n c e a n d k n o w l e d g e of d r e a m s thinks that d r e a m s arcjust chaotic occurrences without meaning, he is a t l i b e r t y t o d o s o .

Let us now look a little more closely at the ways in which the conscious a n d unconscious
contents of the mind are linked together. T a k e a n e x a m p l e w i t h w h i c h e v e r y o n e is familiar. S u d d e n l y y o u find y o u c a n n o t r e m e m b e r w h a t you were going to say next, though a moment ago the thought was perfectly clear. Or perhaps you were about to introduce a friend, and his n a m e escaped you as you were a b o u t to utter it. You say you cannot r e m e m b e r ; in fact, though, the thought has become unconscious, or at least momentarily separated from consciousn e s s . W e find t h e s a m e p h e n o m e n o n w i t h o u r s e n s e s . If w e l i s t e n t o a c o n t i n u o u s n o t e o n t h e fringe of audibility, the sound seems to stop at regular intervals and then start again. Such oscillations are due to a periodic decrease and increase in one's attention, not to any change in the note.
But when something slips out of our cons c i o u s n e s s it d o c s n o t c e a s e to exist, a n y m o r e than a car that has disappeared round a corner h a s v a n i s h e d i n t o t h i n a i r . It is s i m p l y o u t of sight. Just as we m a y later see the car again, so we c o m e across thoughts that were temporarily lost to us.
T h u s , p a r t o f t h e u n c o n s c i o u s c o n s i s t s of a multitude of temporarily obscured thoughts, impressions, a n d images that, in spite of being lost, continue to influence our conscious minds.



A m a n w h o is d i s t r a c t e d o r " a b s e n t - m i n d e d " " will walk across t h e r o o m to fetch s o m e t h i n g . He stops, seemingly perplexed; he has forgotten what he was after. His h a n d s grope about among the objects on t h e t a b l e as if he w e r e s l e e p w a l k i n g ; h e is o b l i v i o u s o f his o r i g i n a l purpose, yet h e is u n c o n s c i o u s l y g u i d e d by it. Then he realizes w h a t it is t h a t he w a n t s . His unconscious has prompted him.
If you observe the b e h a v i o r of a n e u r o t i c person, you can see him doing m a n y things that he appears to be d o i n g consciously a n d purposefully. Yet if you ask h i m a b o u t t h e m , you will d i s c o v e r t h a t h e is e i t h e r u n c o n s c i o u s of t h e m or h a s s o m e t h i n g q u i t e d i f f e r e n t in mind. He hears and does not hear; he sees, yet is b l i n d ; h e k n o w s a n d is i g n o r a n t . S u c h examples are so c o m m o n that the specialist soon realizes that unconscious contents of the m i n d behave as if t h e y w e r e c o n s c i o u s a n d t h a t y o u can never be sure, in such cases, w h e t h e r thought, s p e e c h , o r a c t i o n is c o n s c i o u s o r n o t .
It is this k i n d o f b e h a v i o r t h a t m a k e s so many physicians dismiss statements by hysterical patients as u t t e r lies. S u c h p e r s o n s c e r t a i n l y produce more untruths than most of us, but " l i e " is s c a r c e l y t h e r i g h t w o r d t o u s e .

Even their skin sensations may reveal similar fluctuations of awareness. At one m o m e n t the hysterical person m a y feel a needle prick in the a r m ; at the next it m a y pass u n n o ticed. If his attention can be focused on a certain point, the whole of his body can be completely anesthetized until the tension that causes this blackout of the senses has been rel a x e d . S e n s e p e r c e p t i o n is t h e n i m m e d i a t e l y restored. All the time, however, he has been unconsciously aware of what was happening.
T h e physician can see this process quite clearly w h e n he hypnotizes such a patient. It is e a s y to d e m o n s t r a t e t h a t t h e p a t i e n t h a s b e e n aware of every detail. T h e prick in the a r m or the remark m a d e during an eclipse of consciousness c a n be recalled as a c c u r a t e l y as if there had been no anesthesia or "forgetfulness." I recall a w o m a n who was once admitted to the c l i n i c in a s t a t e of c o m p l e t e s t u p o r . W h e n s h e recovered consciousness next day. she knew who she was but did not know where she was. how or why she had come there, or even the date. Yet after I had hypnotized her, she told me why she had fallen ill. how she h a d got to the clinic, and who had a d m i t t e d her. All these details

could be verified. She was even able to tell the time at which she had been admitted, because she had seen a clock in the e n t r a n c e hall. U n d e r h y p n o s i s , h e r m e m o r y w a s as c l e a r as if she had been completely conscious all the time. When we discuss such matters, we usually have to draw on evidence supplied by clinical observation. For this reason, many critics assume that the unconscious and all its subtle manifestations belong solely to the sphere of psychopathology. They consider any expression of the unconscious as something neurotic or psychotic, which has nothing to do with a normal mental state. But neurotic p h e n o m e n a are by no means the products exclusively of disease. T h e y are in fact no more than pathological e x a g g e r a t i o n s o f n o r m a l o c c u r r e n c e s ; it is o n l y because they are exaggerations that they are more obvious than their normal counterparts. Hysterical s y m p t o m s can be observed in all n o r m a l persons, b u t they are so slight that they usually pass unnoticed.
F o r g e t t i n g , for i n s t a n c e , is a n o r m a l p r o c e s s , in which certain conscious ideas lose their specific e n e r g y b e c a u s e o n e ' s a t t e n t i o n h a s b e e n d e f l e c t e d . W h e n i n t e r e s t t u r n s e l s e w h e r e , it leaves in shadow the things with which one was previously concerned, just as a searchlight lights up a new area by leaving a n o t h e r in darkness. This is u n a v o i d a b l e , for c o n s c i o u s n e s s c a n k e e p only a few i m a g e s in full clarity at o n e time, and even this clarity fluctuates.
But the forgotten ideas have not ceased io exist. Although they cannot be reproduced al will, they are present in a subliminal state just b e y o n d t h e t h r e s h o l d of r e c a l l f r o m w h i c h they can rise again spontaneously at any time, o f t e n a l t e r m a n y y e a r s of a p p a r e n t l y t o t a l oblivion. I a m speaking here of things we have consciously seen or heard, and subsequently forgotten. But we all see, hear, smell, and taste m a n y things without noticing them at the time, either b e c a u s e o u r a t t e n t i o n is d e f l e c t e d o r b e c a u s e t h e s t i m u l u s to o u r senses is t o o slight to l e a v e a conscious impression. The unconscious, however, has taken note of them, and such subliminal sense perceptions play a significant part in our everyday lives. Without our realizing it, they influence the way in w h i c h we react to both events and people.
An e x a m p l e of this that I found particularly revealing was provided by a professor who had been walking in the country with one of his pupils, absorbed in serious conversation. Suddenly he noticed that his thoughts were being i n t e r r u p t e d b y a n u n e x p e c t e d flow of m e m o r i e s from his early childhood. He could not account for this distraction. N o t h i n g in w h a t had been said seemed to have- any connection with these memories. O n looking back, he saw that he had been w a l k i n g past a farm w h e n the first of these childhood recollections had surged up in his mind. He suggested to his pupil that they
In cases of extreme mass hysteria ( w h i c h was in the past called "possession"), the conscious mind and ordinary sense perception seem eclipsed.

Right, rock and roll music in its heyday seemed to induce an almost comparable trance - like excitement.

should walk back to the point where the fantasies had begun. O n c e there, he noticed the smell of geese, a n d i n s t a n t l y he realized t h a t it was this smell that h a d touched off the flow of memories. In his youth he had lived on a farm where geese were kept, and their characteristic smell h a d left a lasting t h o u g h forgotten i m p r e s s i o n . As he passed the farm on his walk, he had noticed the smell subliminally, and this unconscious perception had called back long-forgotten experiences of his childhood. The perception was subliminal, because the attention was engaged elsewhere, and the stimulus was not s t r o n g e n o u g h to deflect it a n d to r e a c h c o n sciousness d i r e c t l y . Y e t it h a d b r o u g h t u p t h e "forgotten" memories.
Such a " c u e " or " t r i g g e r " effect can explain the onset of neurotic symptoms as well as more benign memories when a sight, smell, or sound recalls a c i r c u m s t a n c e in the past. A girl, for instance, m a y be busy in her office, a p p a r e n t l y in good health and spirits. A m o m e n t later she develops a blinding headache and shows other signs of distress. W i t h o u t consciously noticing
it, she has heard the foghorn of a distant ship, a n d t h i s h a s u n c o n s c i o u s l y r e m i n d e d h e r of a n unhappy parting with a lover whom she has been doing her best to forget. Aside from normal forgetting, Freud has described several cases that involve the "forgetting" of disagreeable memories memories t h a t o n e is o n l y t o o r e a d y to lose. As N i e t z s c h e r e m a r k e d , w h e r e p r i d e is i n s i s t e n t e n o u g h , memory prefers to give way. Thus, among the lost memories, we e n c o u n t e r not a few that owe their subliminal state (and their incapacity to be voluntarily reproduced) to their disagreeable and incompatible nature. T h e psychologist calls t h e s e repressed c o n t e n t s .
A case in point might be that of a secretary w h o is j e a l o u s o f o n e of h e r e m p l o y e r ' s a s s o c i ates.

But, if c h a l l e n g e d o n the point, she simply says she "forgot" or was "interrupted." She never admits not even to herself—the real reason for her omission.

happen to their minds that they do not decide and intend. But one must learn to discriminate carefully between intentional a n d unintentional contents of the mind. T h e former are derived from the ego p e r s o n a l i t y ; t h e latter, h o w e v e r , arise from a s o u r c e t h a t is n o t i d e n t i c a l w i t h t h e ego, b u t is its " o t h e r s i d e . " It is this " o t h e r s i d e " that would have m a d e the secretary forget the invitations.
There are many reasons why we forget things that we have noticed or experienced; a n d thereare just as m a n y ways in w h i c h they m a y be recalled to m i n d . A n i n t e r e s t i n g e x a m p l e is t h a t of c r y p t o m n e s i a , o r " c o n c e a l e d r e c o l l e c t i o n . " An author m a y be writing steadily to a preconceived plan, w o r k i n g o u t a n a r g u m e n t or developing the line of a story, w h e n he suddenly runs off at a t a n g e n t . P e r h a p s a fresh i d e a h a s occurred to him, or a different image, or a whole new sub-plot. If you ask him what prompted the digression, he will not be able to tell you. H e m a y n o t e v e n h a v e n o t i c e d t h e change, though he has now produced material that is e n t i r e l y fresh a n d a p p a r e n t l y u n k n o w n to him before. Yet it c a n s o m e t i m e s b e s h o w n convincingly that what he has written bears a striking similarity to the work of a n o t h e r a u t h o r —a work that he believes he has never seen.
I myself found a fascinating e x a m p l e of this in N i e t z s c h e ' s b o o k Thus Spake £arathustra, where the a u t h o r r e p r o d u c e s almost w o r d for word an incident reported in a ship's log for the year 1686. By sheer c h a n c e I h a d read this seaman's yarn in a book published about 1835 (half a century before Nietzsche w r o t e ) ; a n d when I f o u n d t h e s i m i l a r p a s s a g e i n Thus Spake ^arathuslra, I w a s s t r u c k b y its p e c w l i a r s t y l e , which was different from Nietzsche's usual language. I was convinced that Nietzsche must also have seen t h e old b o o k , t h o u g h h e m a d e no reference to it. I w r o t e to his sister, w h o was still alive, a n d s h e c o n f i r m e d t h a t s h e a n d h e r brother had in fact read the book together when h e w a s 11 y e a r s o l d . I t h i n k , f r o m t h e context, it is i n c o n c e i v a b l e t h a t N i e t z s c h e h a d any idea that he was plagiarizing this story. I believe t h a t fifty y e a r s l a t e r it h a d u n e x p e c t e d l y slipped into focus in his conscious m i n d .
I n this t y p e of case t h e r e is g e n u i n e , if u n r e alized, recollection. M u c h the same sort of thing may happen to a musician who has heard a peasant tune or popular song in childhood and finds it c r o p p i n g u p as the t h e m e of a symp h o n i c m o v e m e n t t h a t h e is c o m p o s i n g in a d u l t life. A n idea or a n i m a g e has m o v e d back from the unconscious into the conscious mind. W h a t I have so far said about the unconscious is n o m o r e t h a n a c u r s o r y s k e t c h of t h e nature and functioning of this complex part of the h u m a n psyche. But it should h a v e i n d i c a t e d the kind of subliminal material from which the symbols of our dreams may be spontaneously produced. This subliminal material can consist of all urges, impulses, a n d intentions: all perceptions and intuitions; all rational or irrational thoughts, conclusions, inductions, deductions, and premises; and all varieties of feeling. Any or all of these ca#n take the form of partial, temporary, or constant unconsciousness.
Such material has mostly become unconscious because — in a m a n n e r of speaking t h e r e is n o r o o m for it in t h e c o n s c i o u s m i n d . S o m e of one's thoughts lose their emotional e n e r g y a n d b e c o m e s u b l i m i n a l ( t h a t is to say, they no longer receive so m u c h of o u r conscious attention) because they have come to seem uni n t e r e s t i n g or i r r e l e v a n t , o r b e c a u s e t h e r e is some reason why we wish to push them out of sight.
It is, in fact, n o r m a l a n d necessary for us to "forget" in this fashion, in order to make room in o u r conscious m i n d s for new impressions a n d ideas. If this did not happen, everything we experienced would remain above the threshold of consciousness and our minds would become i m p o s s i b l y c l u t t e r e d . T h i s p h e n o m e n o n is so widely recognized today that most people who k n o w a n y t h i n g a b o u t psychology take it for granted.
But just as conscious contents can vanish into the unconscious, new contents, which have n e v e r y e t b e e n c o n s c i o u s , c a n arise f r o m it. O n e m a y have an inkling, for instance, that s o m e t h i n g is o n t h e p o i n t of b r e a k i n g i n t o c o n s c i o u s n e s s — t h a t " s o m e t h i n g is in t h e a i r , " o r that one "smells a rat."

A g r e a t d e a l ol c o n t r o versial discussion has arisen around this point. But it is a fact t h a t , in a d d i t i o n to m e m o r i e s from a long-distant conscious past, completely new thoughts and creative ideas can also present themselves from the unconscious thoughts and ideas that have never been conscious before. T h e y grow up from the dark depths of the mind like a lotus and form a most important part ol the s u b l i m i n a l psyche.
W e find this in e v e r y d a y life, w h e r e d i l e m m a s are sometimes solved by the most surprising new propositions; many artists, philosophers, and even scientists owe some of their best ideas to inspirations that appear suddenly from the unconscious.

The function of dreams
I have gone into some detail about the origins of o u r d r e a m life, b e c a u s e it is t h e soil f r o m which most symbols originally grow. Unfortunately, dreams are difficult to understand. As I have a l r e a d y p o i n t e d o u t , a d r e a m is q u i t e unlike a story told by the conscious mind. In everyday life o n e t h i n k s o u t w h a t o n e w a n t s to say, selects the most telling w a y of saying it, a n d tries to m a k e one's r e m a r k s logically c o h e r e n t . For instance, an e d u c a t e d person will seek to avoid a m i x e d m e t a p h o r b e c a u s e it m a y g i v e a muddled impression of his point. But d r e a m s have a different texture. Images that seem contradictory and ridiculous crowd in on the d r e a m e r , t h e n o r m a l s e n s e of t i m e is lost, a n d commonplace things can assume a fascinating or threatening aspect.
It m a y seem s t r a n g e t h a t the u n c o n s c i o u s mind should order its material so differently from the s e e m i n g l y d i s c i p l i n e d p a t t e r n t h a t w e
c a n i m p o s e on o u r t h o u g h t s in w a k i n g life. Yet a n y o n e w h o stops for a m o m e n t to recall a d r e a m will b e a w a r e of this c o n t r a s t , w h i c h is in fact one of the main reasons why the ordinary person finds d r e a m s so h a r d to u n d e r s t a n d . T h e y d o not m a k e sense in terms of his n o r m a l w a k i n g e x p e r i e n c e , a n d t h e r e f o r e h e is i n c l i n e d either to disregard them or to confess that they baffle him.
P e r h a p s it m a y be easier to u n d e r s t a n d this p o i n t if w e first realize t h e fact t h a t t h e ideas with which we deal in our a p p a r e n t l y disciplined w a k i n g life a r e by no m e a n s as precise as we like to believe. O n the contrary, their m e a n i n g (and their emotional significance for us) becomes more imprecise the more closely w e e x a m i n e t h e m . T h e r e a s o n for this is t h a t anything we have heard or experienced can b e c o m e s u b l i m i n a l t h a t is to say, c a n pass i n t o the unconscious. And even what we retain in

our conscious mind and can reproduce at will has acquired an unconscious undertone that will c o l o r t h e i d e a e a c h t i m e it is r e c a l l e d . O u r conscious impressions, in fact, quickly assume a n e l e m e n t of u n c o n s c i o u s m e a n i n g t h a t is psychically significant for us, t h o u g h we are not consciously aware of the existence of this subliminal m e a n i n g or of the w a y in w h i c h it b o t h extends and confuses the conventional meaning.
O f course, such psychic undertones differ f r o m o n e p e r s o n t o a n o t h e r . E a c h of us r e c e i v e s a n y abstract or general notion in the context of the individual mind, and we therefore unders t a n d a n d a p p l y it in o u r i n d i v i d u a l w a y s . When, in conversation, I use any such terms as "'state," "money," "health," or "society," I assume that my listeners understand more or less the s a m e thing as I do. But the p h r a s e " m o r e or less" makes my point. Each word means something slightly different to each person, even among those who share the same cultural backg r o u n d . T h e r e a s o n for this v a r i a t i o n is t h a t a g e n e r a l n o t i o n is r e c e i v e d i n t o a n i n d i v i d u a l c o n t e x t a n d is t h e r e f o r e u n d e r s t o o d a n d a p p l i e d in a slightly individual way. And the difference of m e a n i n g is n a t u r a l l y g r e a t e s t w h e n p e o p l e have widely different social, political, religious or psychological experiences.
As long as concepts are identical with mere w o r d s , t h e v a r i a t i o n is a l m o s t i m p e r c e p t i b l e a n d plays no practical role. But when an exact defin i t i o n o r a c a r e f u l e x p l a n a t i o n is n e e d e d , o n e can occasionally discover the most amazing variations, not only in the purely intellectual u n d e r s t a n d i n g of the term, but particularly in its emotional tone a n d its application. As a rule, these variations are subliminal and therefore never realized. v
O n e m a y tend to dismiss such differences as r e d u n d a n t or expendable nuances of meaning that have little relevance to everyday needs. But the fact that they exist shows that even the most matter-of-fact contents of consciousness have a p e n u m b r a of uncertainty around them. Even the most carefully defined philosophical or mathematical concept, which we are sure does n o t c o n t a i n m o r e t h a n w e h a v e p u t i n t o it, is nevertheless m o r e t h a n w e a s s u m e . It is a
psychic event and as such partly unknowable. T h e very n u m b e r s you use in counting are more than you take them to be. They are at the same time mythological elements (for the Pythagoreans, they were even divine); but you are certainly u n a w a r e of this when you use numbers for a practical purpose. Every concept in o u r conscious m i n d , in short, has its o w n psychic associations. While such associations may vary in intensity (according to the relative importance of the concept to our whole personality, or according to the other i d e a s a n d e v e n c o m p l e x e s t o w h i c h it is a s s o ciated in our unconscious), they are capable of

These subliminal aspects of everything that happens to us m a y seem to play very little part in our daily lives. But in d r e a m analysis, w h e r e the p s y c h o l o g i s t is d e a l i n g w i t h e x p r e s s i o n s of the unconscious, they a r c very relevant, for they arc the almost invisible roots of our conscious t h o u g h t s . T h a i is w h y c o m m o n p l a c e o b j e c t s o r ideas can assume such powerful psychic significance in a d r e a m that we may a w a k e seriously disturbed, in spite of h a v i n g d r e a m e d of nothing worse than a locked room or a missed train.
T h e images p r o d u c e d in d r e a m s are m u c h more picturesque and vivid than the concepts and experiences that arc their waking counterparts. O n e ol t h e r e a s o n s for t h i s is t h a t , in a dream, such concepts can express their unconscious meaning. In our conscious thoughts, we restrain ourselves within the limits of rational statements s t a t e m e n t s that are m u c h less colorful b e c a u s e w e h a v e s t r i p p e d t h e m of m o s t of their psychic associations.
I recall o n e d r e a m ol i m o w n that I found difficult to i n t e r p r e t . In this d r e a m , a certain man was trying to get behind me and j u m p on m\ back. I knew n o t h i n g of this m a n except that I was a w a r e that he had somehow picked u p a r e m a r k I h a d m a d e a n d h a d t w i s t e d it i n t o a grotesque travesty of mv m e a n i n g . But I
could not sec the connection b e t w e e n this fact a n d his a t t e m p t in the d r e a m to j u m p on me. In m y p r o f e s s i o n a l life, h o w e v e r , it h a s often happened that someone has misrepresented what I have said so often that I have scarcely bothered to wonder whether this kind of misr e p r e s e n t a t i o n m a k e s m e a n g r y . N o w t h e r e is a certain v a l u e in k e e p i n g a conscious control over one's emotional reactions: and this. I soon r e a l i z e d , w a s t h e p o i n t t h e d r e a m h a d m a d e .

An American equivalent, which could easily a p p e a r in a similar d r e a m , would be " G o j u m p in the lake."
O n e could say that this dream picture was s y m b o l i c , for it d i d n o t s t a t e t h e s i t u a t i o n d i r e c t l y b u t e x p r e s s e d t h e p o i n t i n d i r e c t l y l>v m e a n s o f a m e t a p h o r t h a t I c o u l d n o t a t first u n d e r s t a n d .

have consigned to the unconscious all the fantastic psychic associations that every object or idea possesses. T h e primitive, on the other hand, is still a w a r e o f t h e s e p s y c h i c p r o p e r t i e s ; h e endows animals, plants, or stones with powers t h a t w e find s t r a n g e a n d u n a c c e p t a b l e . An African j u n g l e dweller, for instance, sees a nocturnal c r e a t u r e by daylight a n d knows it to be a medicine m a n w h o has t e m p o r a r i l y taken its s h a p e . O r h e m a y r e g a r d it as t h e bush soul or ancestral spirit of o n e of his tribe. A tree m a y play a vital p a r t in t h e life of a p r i m i tive, a p p a r e n t l y possessing for h i m its o w n soul and voice, a n d the m a n c o n c e r n e d will feel that he shares its fate. T h e r e are some I n d i a n s in South America who will assure you that they are Red Arara parrots, though they are well aware that they lack feathers, wings, and beaks. For in the primitive's world things d o not h a v e the same sharp boundaries they do in our "rational" societies.
What psychologists call psychic identity, or "mystical participation," has been stripped oir our world of t h i n g s . B u t it is e x a c t l y this h a l o of u n c o n s c i o u s a s s o c i a t i o n s t h a t g i v e s a c o l o r f u l and fantastic aspect to the primitive's world. We have lost it to such a d e g r e e t h a t we d o not recognize it w h e n w e m e e t it a g a i n . W i t h us such things are kept below the threshold; w h e n they occasionally r e a p p e a r , we even insist that s o m e t h i n g is w r o n g .
I have more than once been consulted by well-educated and intelligent people who have had peculiar dreams, fantasies, or even visions, which have shocked them deeply. T h e y have
a s s u m e d t h a t n o o n e w h o is in a s o u n d s t a t e of mind could suffer from such things, and that anyone who actually sees a vision must be pathologically disturbed. A theologian once told me that Ezekiel's visions were nothing more than morbid symptoms, and that, when Moses and other prophets heard "voices" speaking to them, they were suffering from hallucinations. Y o u c a n i m a g i n e the p a n i c h e felt w h e n something of this kind "spontaneously" h a p p e n e d to him. W e are so accustomed to the apparently rational nature of our world that we can scarcely imagine anything happening that cannot be explained by c o m m o n sense. The primitive m a n confronted by a shock of this kind would not d o u b t his sanity; he would think of fetishes, spirits, or gods.
Yet the emotions that affect us are just the same. In fact, the terrors that stem from our elaborate civilization m a y be far more threatening than those that primitive people attribute to demons. T h e attitude of modern civilized m a n sometimes reminds me of a psychotic patient in my clinic who was himself a doctor. One morning I asked him how he was. He replied that he had had a wonderful night disinfecting the whole of heaven with mercuric chloride, but that in the course of this thoroughgoing sanitary process he had found no trace of God. Here we see a neurosis or something worse. Instead of God or the "fear of G o d , " t h e r e is a n a n x i e t y n e u r o s i s o r s o m e k i n d of phobia. The emotion has remained the same, but its object has c h a n g e d both its n a m e and n a t u r e for the worse.

M o d e r n "rational" man has tried to cut himself off from such psychic associations (which nevertheless survive in the u n c o n s c i o u s ) ; to him, a spade is a spade a n d a lion is only w h a t the d i c t i o n a r y ( r i g h t ) says it is.

I have made several comparisons of this kind between modern and primitive man. Such comparisons, as I shall show later, are essential to
an understanding of the symbol-making propensities of m a n , and of the part that dreams play in expressing them. For one finds that many dreams present images and associations that arc analogous to primitive ideas, myths, and rites. These dream images were called "archaic remnants" by Freud; the phrase suggests that they are psychic elements surviving in the h u m a n mind from ages long ago. Ibis point of v i e w is c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of t h o s e w h o r e g a r d t h e u n c o n s c i o u s a s a m e r e a p p e n d i x of c o n s c i o u s ness (or, more picturesquely, as a trash can that collects all the refuse of the conscious mind I.
Further investigation suggested to me that this a t t i t u d e is u n t e n a b l e a n d s h o u l d b e disc a r d e d . I f o u n d t h a t a s s o c i a t i o n s a n d i m a g e s of t h i s k i n d a r c a n i n t e g r a l p a r t of t h e u n c o n scious, and can be observed everywhere w h e t h e r t h e d r e a m e r is e d u c a t e d o r i l l i t e r a t e , intelligent or s t u p i d . T h e y are not in any sense lifeless or meaningless " r e m n a n t s .

T h e y form a bridge between the ways in which we consciously express our thoughts and a more primitive, more colorful and pictorial form of

expression. It is this f o r m , as w e l l , t h a t a p p e a l s directly to feeling and emotion. These "historical" associations are the link between the rational world of consciousness and the world of instinct". I have already discussed the interesting contrast between the " c o n t r o l l e d " t h o u g h t s we h a v e in w a k i n g life a n d t h e w e a l t h of i m a g e r y p r o duced in d r e a m s . N o w you c a n see a n o t h e r reason for this difference: B e c a u s e , in o u r civilized life, wc h a v e s t r i p p e d so m a n y ideas of their e m o t i o n a l e n e r g y , w e d o n o t r e a l l y respond to them any more. W e use such ideas in our speech, a n d w e s h o w a c o n v e n t i o n a l r e action when others use t h e m , but they d o not make a very deep impression on us. Something more is n e e d e d to b r i n g c e r t a i n t h i n g s h o m e t o us effectively e n o u g h to m a k e us c h a n g e o u r attitude a n d b e h a v i o r . T h i s is w h a t " d r e a m language" does; its symbolism has so m u c h psychic energy that we are forced to p a y attention to it.
There was, for instance, a lady w h o was well known for her s t u p i d p r e j u d i c e s a n d h e r s t u b born resistance to reasoned a r g u m e n t . O n e could have a r g u e d with h e r all night to no effect; she w o u l d h a v e t a k e n n o t t h e slightest notice. Her d r e a m s , however, took a different line of a p p r o a c h . O n e n i g h t , she d r e a m e d she was a t t e n d i n g a n i m p o r t a n t social occasion. She was greeted by the hostess with the w o r d s : "How nice that you could come. All your
friends are here, a n d they are waiting for y o u . " T h e hostess then led her to the door and opened it, a n d the d r e a m e r stepped t h r o u g h —into a cowshed! This d r e a m language was simple enough to be understood even by a blockhead. The w o m a n w o u l d n o t a t first a d m i t t h e p o i n t o f a d r e a m that struck so directly at her self-importa n c e ; b u t its message nevertheless went h o m e , a n d after a t i m e she h a d to accept it b e c a u s e she could not help seeing the self-inflicted joke.
Such messages from the unconscious are of greater importance than most people realize. In o u r conscious life, w e are exposed to all kinds of influences. O t h e r people stimulate or depress us, events at t h e office or in o u r social life distract us. Such things seduce us into following ways that are unsuitable to our individuality. W h e t h e r or not we are a w a r e of the effect they h a v e o n o u r c o n s c i o u s n e s s , it is d i s t u r b e d b y and exposed to them almost without defense. T h i s is e s p e c i a l l y t h e case w i t h a p e r s o n w h o s e extraverted attitude of mind lays all the emphasis upon external objects, or who harbors feelings of inferiority a n d d o u b t concerning his own innermost personality.

T h e g e n e r a l function of d r e a m s is to try to restore our psychological balance by producing d r e a m material that re-establishes, in a subtle w a y , t h e t o t a l p s y c h i c e q u i l i b r i u m . T h i s is w h a t I call the complementary (or compensatory) role of d r e a m s in our psychic make-up. It explains why people who have unrealistic ideas or too high an opinion of themselves, or who make grandiose plans out of proportion to their real capacities, have dreams of flying or falling. T h e d r e a m c o m p e n s a t e s for the deficiencies of their p e r s o n a l i t i e s , a n d at t h e s a m e t i m e il warns them of the dangers in their present course. If the warnings of the d r e a m are disregarded, real accidents may take their place. T h e victim m a y fall d o w n s t a i r s or m a y h a v e a motor accident.
I r e m e m b e r the case of a m a n w h o was inextricably involved in a n u m b e r of shady affairs. H e d e v e l o p e d a n almost m o r b i d passion for dangerous mountain climbing, as a sort of compensation. He was seeking "to get above himself." In a d r e a m one night, he saw himself stepping off the s u m m i t of a high m o u n t a i n into empty space. W h e n he told me his dream, I instantly saw his danger and tried to e m p h a size the warning a n d persuade him to restrain himself. I even told him that the d r e a m fore
s h a d o w e d his death in a m o u n t a i n accident. It was in vain. Six m o n t h s later he " s t e p p e d off into space." A mountain guide watched him and a friend letting themselves down on a rope in a difficult place. T h e friend had found a temporary foothold on a ledge, and the dreamer was following him down. Suddenly he let go of the rope, according to the guide, "as if h e w e r e j u m p i n g i n t o t h e a i r . " H e fell u p o n his friend, a n d both went d o w n a n d were killed.
Another typical case was that of a lady who was living above herself. She was high and m i g h t y in her daily life, but she h a d shocking dreams, reminding her of all sorts of unsavory things. When I discovered them, she indignantly refused to acknowledge them. T h e d r e a m s then b e c a m e m e n a c i n g , a n d full of references to the walks she used to take by herself in the woods, where she indulged in soulful fantasies. I saw her danger, but she would not listen to my m a n y warnings. Soon afterwards, she was savagely attacked in the woods by a sexual pervert; but for the intervention of some people who heard her screams, she would have been killed.
T h e r e was no magic in this. W h a t her dreams had told me was that this w o m a n had a secret longing for such an a d v e n t u r e — j u s t as

Left, t w o influences to w h i c h an individual's consciousness is subjected: Advertising (a 1 960s American advertisement stressing "sociability") and political propaganda (a French poster for a 1962 referendum, urging a vote of "yes" but plastered w i t h the opposition's " n o " ) . These and other influences may cause us to live in ways unsuited to our i n d i v i d u a l natures: and the psychic imbalance that can follow must be c o m p e n s a t e d for by the unconscious.
The lighthouse keeper, right (in a cartoon by America's Roland B Wilson), has apparently become a little disturbed psychologically by his isolation His u n c o n s c i o u s , in its c o m p e n s a t o r y f u n c t i o n , h a s produced a hallucinatory companion, to w h o m the keeper confesses (in thecartoon caption): "Not only that, Bill, but I c a u g h t myself talking to myself again yesterday I"
The Delphic oracle, b e l o w , being consulted by King Aegeus of Athens (from a vase painting). " M e s s a g e s " from the unconscious are often as cryptic and a m b i g u o u s as were the oracle's utterances.
the mountain climber unconsciously sought the s a t i s f a c t i o n o f finding a d e f i n i t e w a y o u t o f his difficulties. Obviously, neither of them expected t h e stiff p r i c e i n v o l v e d : S h e h a d s e v e r a l b o n e s b r o k e n , a n d he paid with his life. Thus dreams may sometimes announce certain situations long before they actually happen. T h i s is n o t n e c e s s a r i l y a m i r a c l e o r a f o r m of precognition. M a n y crises in our lives have a long unconscious history. We move toward them step by step, unaware of the dangers that a r e a c c u m u l a t i n g . But w h a t w e consciously fail to see is f r e q u e n t l y p e r c e i v e d b y o u r u n c o n scious, which can pass the information on through dreams.
D r e a m s m a y often w a r n us in this w a y ; but just as often, it seems, they do not. Therefore, any assumption of a benevolent hand restraini n g us in t i m e is d u b i o u s . O r , to s t a t e it m o r e positively, it s e e m s t h a t a b e n e v o l e n t a g e n c y is sometimes at work and sometimes not. The mysterious hand may even point the way to perdition; dreams sometimes prove to be traps, or a p p e a r to be so. T h e y sometimes behave like the Delphic oracle that told King Croesus that if he crossed t h e H a l y s R i v e r h e w o u l d d e s t r o y a large kingdom. It was only after he had been completely defeated in battle after the crossing



that he discovered that the kingdom meant by the oracle was his own! O n e cannot afford to be naive in dealing w i t h d r e a m s . T h e y o r i g i n a t e in a spirit t h a t is n o t q u i t e h u m a n , b u t is r a t h e r a b r e a t h of nature —a spirit of the beautiful and generous as well as of the cruel goddess. If we w a n t to characterize this spirit, we shall certainly get closer to it in the s p h e r e of a n c i e n t mythologies, or the fables of the primeval forest, than in the consciousness of modern man. I a m not denying that great gains have resulted from the evolution of civilized society. But these gains have been m a d e at the price of enormous losses, whose extent we have scarcely begun to estimate. Part of the purpose of my comparisons between the primitive and the civilized states of man has been to show the balance of these losses a n d gains.
Primitive m a n was much more governed by his instincts than are his "rational*" m o d e r n descendants, who have learned to "control" themselves. In this civilizing process, we have increasingly divided our consciousness from the deeper instinctive strata of the h u m a n psyche, and even ultimately from the somatic basis of the psychic phenomenon. Fortunately, we have not lost these basic instinctive strata; they remain part of the unconscious, even though they may express themselves only in the form of dream images. These instinctive p h e n o m e n a one may not, incidentally, always recognize t h e m for w h a t t h e y a r e , for t h e i r c h a r a c t e r is symbolic play a vital part in w h a t I have called the compensating function of dreams.
For the sake of mental stability and even physiological health, the unconscious and the conscious must be integrally connected and thus move on parallel lines. If they are split apart or "dissociated," psychological d i s t u r b a n c e follows. In this respect, d r e a m symbols are the essential message carriers from the instinctive to the rational parts of the h u m a n mind, and their interpretation enriches the poverty of consciousness so that it learns to u n d e r s t a n d a g a i n the forgotten language of the instincts.
Of course, people are bound to query this function, since its symbols so often pass un
noticed or u n c o m p r e h e n d e d . In n o r m a l life, the u n d e r s t a n d i n g of d r e a m s is often c o n s i d e r e d superfluous. I can illustrate this by my experience with a primitive tribe in East Africa. T o my amazement, these tribesmen denied that they had any dreams. But through patient, indirect talks with them I soon found that they had dreams just like everyone else, but that they were convinced their dreams had no meaning. " D r e a m s of ordinary men mean nothing,"' they told me. They thought that the only dreams that mattered were those of chiefs and medicine men; these, which concerned the welfare of the tribe, were highly appreciated. The only drawback was that the chief and the medicine man both claimed that they had ceased having meaningful dreams. They dated this change from the time that the British came to their country. T h e district commissioner the British official in charge of t h e m h a d taken over the function of the "great d r e a m s " that had hitherto guided the tribe's behavior.
When these tribesmen conceded that they did have dreams, but thought them meaningless, they were like the m o d e r n m a n w h o thinks that a d r e a m has no significance for him simply because he does not understand it. But even a civilized man can sometimes observe that a dream (which he may not even remember) can alter his m o o d for better or worse. T h e d r e a m

A n d , s p e a k i n g m o r e g e n e r a l l y , it is p l a i n foolishness to believe in r e a d y - m a d e systematic guides to d r e a m i n t e r p r e t a t i o n , as if o n e could simply buy a reference book and look u p a particular symbol. No d r e a m symbol can be separated from the individual w h o d r e a m s it, and there is n o d e f i n i t e o r s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d i n t e r p r e tation of any d r e a m . E a c h individual varies so much in the w a y that his unconscious c o m p l e ments or compensates his conscious mind that it is i m p o s s i b l e t o b e s u r e h o w f a r d r e a m s a n d their symbols can be classified at all.
It is t r u e t h a t t h e r e a r e d r e a m s a n d s i n g l e symbols (I should prefer to call t h e m " m o t i f s " )
that are typical and often occur. A m o n g such motifs are falling, flying, being persecuted by dangerous animals or hostile men, being insufficiently or absurdly clothed in public places, being in a hurry or lost in a milling crowd, fighting with useless weapons or being wholly defenseless, running hard yet getting nowhere. A t y p i c a l i n f a n t i l e m o t i f is t h e d r e a m of g r o w ing infinitely small or infinitely big, or being transformed from one to the other as you find it, for i n s t a n c e , i n L e w i s C a r r o l l ' s Alice in Wonderland. B u t I m u s t s t r e s s a g a i n t h a t t h e s e a r e motifs that must be considered in the context of the d r e a m itself, not as self-explanatory ciphers.
T h e r e c u r r i n g d r e a m is a n o t e w o r t h y p h e n o menon. T h e r e are cases in which people have dreamed the same dream from childhood into the later years of adult life.

a n a t o m y offish a n d m y m o t h e r ran a hotel for ghostly visitors. Usually this unfamiliar guest wing was an ancient historical building, long forgotten, yet my inherited property. It contained interesting antique furniture, and toward the end of this series of dreams I discovered an old library whose books were unknown to me. Finally, in the last dream, I opened one of the books a n d found in it a profusion of the most marvelous symbolic pictures. When I awoke, my heart was palpitating with excitement.
Some time before I had this particular last d r e a m of the series, I had placed an order with an a n t i q u a r i a n bookseller for one of the classic compilations of medieval alchemists. I had found a quotation in literature that I thought might have some connection with early Byzantine a l c h e m y , a n d I wished to check it. Several weeks after I had had the dream of the unknown book, a parcel arrived from the bookseller. Inside was a p a r c h m e n t volume dating from the 16th century. It was illustrated by fascinating symbolic pictures that instantly reminded me of those I had seen in m y dream. As the rediscovery of the principles of alchemy came to be an important part of m y work as a pioneer of psychology, the motif of m y recurring dream can easily be understood. T h e house, of course, was a symbol of my persona l i t y a n d its c o n s c i o u s field o f i n t e r e s t s ; a n d t h e unknown annex represented the anticipation of a n e w field o f i n t e r e s t a n d r e s e a r c h o f w h i c h m y conscious mind was at that time unaware. From that moment, 30 years ago, I never had the dream again.

The analysis of dreams
I began this essay by noting the difference between a sign a n d a s y m b o l . T h e sign is a l w a y s less t h a n t h e c o n c e p t it r e p r e s e n t s , w h i l e a s y m bol always stands for s o m e t h i n g m o r e t h a n its obvious and immediate meaning. Symbols, moreover, are natural and spontaneous products. No genius has ever sat down with a pen or a brush in his h a n d a n d said: " N o w I a m going to invent a symbol." No one can take a more or less rational t h o u g h t , r e a c h e d as a logical conclusion or by deliberate intent, a n d then give it " s y m b o l i c " f o r m . N o m a t t e r w h a t fantastic trappings one m a y put u p o n a n idea of this kind, it will still r e m a i n a sign, linked to the conscious thought behind it, not a symbol that hints at something not yet known. In dreams, symbols occur spontaneously, for dreams happen and are not invented; they are, therefore, the main source of all our knowledge about symbolism.
But symbols, I must point out, do not occur solely in d r e a m s . T h e y a p p e a r in all kinds of psychic manifestations. T h e r e are symbolic thoughts and feelings, symbolic acts and situations. It often seems that even i n a n i m a t e objects co-operate with the unconscious in the arrangement of symbolic patterns. T h e r e arc n u m e r o u s well-authenticated stories of clocks stopping at the moment of their owner's d e a t h ; one was the p e n d u l u m clock in the palace of Frederick the Great at Sans Souci, which stopped w h e n
the king died. Other common examples are those of a mirror that breaks, or a picture that falls, w h e n a death occurs; or m i n o r but unexp l a i n e d b r e a k a g e s in a h o u s e w h e r e s o m e o n e is passing t h r o u g h a n e m o t i o n a l crisis. E v e n if skeptics refuse to credit such reports, stories of this kind are always cropping up, and this alone should serve as ample proof of their psychological importance.
There are many symbols, however (among them the most important), that are not indiv i d u a l b u t collective i n t h e i r n a t u r e a n d o r i g i n . These are chiefly religious images. T h e believer assumes that they are of divine origin — that they have been revealed to man. T h e skeptic says flatly that they have been invented. Both a r e w r o n g . It is t r u e , as t h e skeptic notes, t h a t religious symbols and concepts have for centuries been the object of careful and quite conscious e l a b o r a t i o n . It is e q u a l l y t r u e , as t h e believer implies, t h a t their origin is so far b u r i e d in the mystery of the past that they seem to have no h u m a n source. But they are in fact "collective representations," emanating from primeval dreams and creative fantasies. As such, these images are involuntary spontaneous manifestations and by no means intentional inventions.
This fact, as I shall later explain, has a direct and important bearing upon the interpretation of d r e a m s . It is o b v i o u s t h a t if y o u a s s u m e t h e
Inanimate objects sometimes seem to "act" symbolically: left, the clock of Frederick the Great, w h i c h stopped w h e n its owner died in 1786.
Symbols are produced spontaneously from the unconscious (though they may later be consciously elaborated). Right, the ankh, a n c i e n t E g y p t ' s symbol of life, the universe, and man. By contrast, the airways insignia (far right) are consciously contrived signs, not symbols.

In the latter case, dream interpretation makes little sense, for you find only w h a t you already know.
It is for this r e a s o n t h a t I h a v e a l w a y s said to my pupils: " L e a r n as m u c h as you can a b o u t s y m b o l i s m ; then forget it all w h e n you a r e a n a l y z i n g a d r e a m . " T h i s a d v i c e is of such practical i m p o r t a n c e that I h a v e m a d e it a rule to remind myself that I can never understand somebody else's d r e a m well enough to interpret il c o r r e c t l y . I h a v e d o n e t h i s in o r d e r t o c h e c k the flow of m y o w n associations a n d reactions, which might otherwise prevail over my patient's u n c e r t a i n t i e s a n d h e s i t a t i o n s . As it is of t h e greatest therapeutic i m p o r t a n c e for a n analyst to get the particular message of a d r e a m (that is, t h e c o n t r i b u t i o n t h a t t h e u n c o n s c i o u s is m a k ing to the conscious mind) as accurately as possible, it is essential for h i m to e x p l o r e t h e c o n tent of a d r e a m with the utmost thoroughness.
I had a dream when I was working with Freud that illustrates this point. I dreamed that I w a s i n " m y h o m e , " a p p a r e n t l y o n t h e first floor, in a cosy, pleasant sitting room furnished in the m a n n e r of the 18th century. I was astonished that I had never seen this room before, and began to w o n d e r w h a t the ground floor was like. I went downstairs and found the place was rather dark, with paneled walls and heavy
furniture dating from the 16th century or even earlier. My surprise and curiosity increased. I wanted to see more of the whole structure of this house. So I went down to the cellar, where I found a door opening onto a flight of stone steps that led to a large vaulted room. T h e floor consisted of large slabs of stone and the walls seemed very ancient. I examined the mortar a n d found it was mixed with splinters of brick. Obviously the walls were of R o m a n origin. I became increasingly excited. In one corner, I saw an iron ring on a stone slab. I pulled up the slab and saw yet another narrow flight of steps leading to a kind of cave, which seemed to be a prehistoric tomb, containing two skulls, some bones, and broken shards of pottery. T h e n I woke up.
If Freud, when he analyzed this dream, had followed m y m e t h o d of exploring its specific associations and context, he would have heard a far-reaching story. But I am afraid he would h a v e dismissed it as a m e r e effort to escape from a problem that was really his own. T h e d r e a m is in fact a s h o r t s u m m a r y of m y life, more specifically of the development of my mind. I grew up in a house 200 years old, our furniture consisted mostly of pieces about 300 years old, and mentally my hitherto greatest spiritual adventure had been to study the philosophies of K a n t and Schopenhauer. The great news of the day was the work of Charles Darwin. Shortly before this, I had been living with the still medieval concepts of m y parents, for
Right, Jung's mother and father. Jung's interest in ancient religion and mythology drew him away from the religious world of his parents (hisfather wasa pastor)—as shown by the dream, discussed on this page, that he had while w o r k i n g w i t h Freud.

M y Christian faith h a d b e c o m e relative through its e n c o u n t e r with Eastern religions a n d G r e e k p h i l o s o p h y . It is for this r e a s o n t h a t the ground floor was so still, dark, a n d obviously uninhabited.
My then historical interests had developed from an original p r e o c c u p a t i o n with c o m p a r a tive a n a t o m y a n d paleontology while I was working as an assistant at the Anatomical Institute. I w a s fascinated by the b o n e s of fossil m a n , p a r t i c u l a r l y b y t h e m u c h d i s c u s s e d Neanderthalensis a n d t h e still m o r e c o n t r o v e r s i a l skull o f D u b o i s ' Pithecanthropus. A s a m a t t e r of fact these w e r e m y real associations to the dream; but I did not dare to mention the subject of skulls, skeletons, or corpses to Freud, because I had learned that this theme was not popular with him. He cherished the peculiar idea that I anticipated his early death. And he drew this conclusion from the fact that I had shown m u c h interest in the mummified corpses in the so-called Bleikeller in B r e m e n , w h i c h w e visited together in 1909 on our w a y to take the boat to America.
T h u s I felt reluctant to c o m e out with m y own thoughts, since through recent experience I was deeply impressed by the almost unbridge• able gap between Freud's mental outlook and background and my own. I was afraid of losing his friendship if I s h o u l d o p e n u p to h i m a b o u t
my own inner world, which, I surmised, would look very queer to him. Feeling quite uncertain about my own psychology, I almost automatically told him a lie a b o u t m y "free associations" in order to escape the impossible task of enlightening him about my very personal and utterly different constitution.
I must apologize for this rather lengthy narration of the j a m I got into through telling F r e u d m y d r e a m . But it is a g o o d e x a m p l e of the difficulties in which one gets involved in the course of a real dream analysis. So much depends upon the personal differences between the analyst and the analyzed. I soon realized that F r e u d was looking for some incompatible wish of mine. A n d so I suggested tentatively that the skulls I had dreamed of might refer to certain members of my family whose d e a t h , for some reason, I might desire. This proposal met with his approval, but I was not satisfied with such a " p h o n e y " solution.
W h i l e I w a s t r y i n g t o find a s u i t a b l e a n s w e r to Freud's questions, I was suddenly confused by an intuition about the role that the subjective factor plays in psychological understanding. M y intuition was so overwhelming that I thought only of how to get out of this impossible snarl, and I took the easy way out by a lie. This was neither elegant nor morally defensible, but otherwise I should have risked a fatal r o w with F r e u d — a n d I did not feel u p to that for m a n y reasons.
M y intuition consisted of the sudden and most unexpected insight into the fact that my d r e a m m e a n t myself, my life a n d my w o r l d , m y whole reality against a theoretical structure erected by another, strange m i n d for reasons and purposes of its own. It was not Freud's d r e a m , it was m i n e ; a n d I u n d e r s t o o d s u d d e n l y in a flash w h a t m y d r e a m meant.
This conflict illustrates a vital point about d r e a m a n a l y s i s . It is n o t so m u c h a t e c h n i q u e that can be learned and applied according to t h e rules as it is a d i a l e c t i c a l e x c h a n g e b e t w e e n t w o p e r s o n a l i t i e s . If it is h a n d l e d as a m e c h a n i cal technique, the individual psychic personality of the d r e a m e r gets lost a n d the therap e u t i c p r o b l e m is r e d u c e d to t h e s i m p l e q u e s

tion: Which of the two people concerned —the analyst or the dreamer—will dominate the other? I gave u p h y p n o t i c t r e a t m e n t for this very reason, because I did not want to impose my will on others. I wanted the healing processes to grow out of the patient's own personality, not from suggestions by me that would have only a passing effect. M y aim was to protect and preserve my patient's dignity and freed o m , so that he could live his life a c c o r d i n g to his o w n wishes. In this e x c h a n g e with F r e u d , it d a w n e d on m e for the first time t h a t before w e construct general theories about m a n and his psyche we should learn a lot more about the real h u m a n being we have to deal with.

The problem of types
I n all o t h e r b r a n c h e s of science, it is l e g i t i m a t e to apply a hypothesis to an impersonal subject. Psychology, however, inescapably confronts you with the living relations between two individuals, neither of w h o m can be divested of his subjective personality, nor, indeed, depersonalized in any other way. T h e analyst and his patient m a y set out by agreeing to deal with a chosen problem in an impersonal and objective manner; but once they are engaged, their whole personalities are involved in their discussion. At this point, further progress is. possible only if m u t u a l a g r e e m e n t c a n be r e a c h e d .

O n l y if w e m a k e a c o m parison between our conclusions and the standards that are generally valid in the social milieu to which the individuals belong. Even then, we must take into account the mental equilibrium (or "sanity") of the individual concerned. For the result cannot be a completely collective leveling out of the individual to
An assertive extravert overpowers a w i t h d r a w n introvert in a cartoon by America's Jules Feiffer. These Jungian terms for human "types" are not dogmatic: For instance, Gandhi, right, was both an ascetic (introvert) and a political leader (extravert).

adjust him to the " n o r m s " of his society. This would a m o u n t to a most unnatural condition. A sane a n d n o r m a l society is o n e in w h i c h people habitually disagree, because general a g r e e m e n t is relatively r a r e o u t s i d e t h e s p h e r e of i n s t i n c t i v e h u m a n q u a l i t i e s .
Disagreement functions as a vehicle of mental life in society, b u t it is n o t a g o a l ; a g r e e m e n t is e q u a l l y i m p o r t a n t . B e c a u s e p s y c h o l o g y basically depends upon balanced opposites, no judgment can be considered to be final in which its reversibility has not been taken into account. T h e reason for this peculiarity lies in the fact t h a t t h e r e is n o s t a n d p o i n t a b o v e o r outside psychology that would enable us to form an ultimate j u d g m e n t of w h a t t h e psyche is.
In spite of the fact that d r e a m s d e m a n d individual treatment, some generalities are necessary in order to classify a n d clarify the material that the psychologist collects by studying m a n y individuals. It would obviously be impossible to
formulate any psychological theory, or to teach it, by describing large n u m b e r s of separate cases without a n y effort to see w h a t they have in c o m m o n a n d h o w they differ. A n y general characteristic can be chosen as a basis. O n e can, for instance, make a relatively simple distinction between individuals who have "extraverted" personalities and others who are "introv e r t e d . " T h i s is o n l y o n e of m a n y possible generalizations, b u t it enables o n e to see i m m e diately t h e difficulties t h a t c a n arise if t h e a n a lyst should h a p p e n to b e o n e type a n d his patient the other.
Since any deeper analysis of dreams leads to the confrontation of t w o individuals, it will obviously make a great difference whether their types of attitude are the same or not. If both belong to the same type, they m a y sail along h a p p i l y for a l o n g t i m e .

amount to more than mere advantages on the side of the analyst. They do not keep him outside t h e fray, in w h i c h h e is b o u n d to b e tested j u s t as m u c h as his p a t i e n t . Thus it m a t t e r s a good deal whether their personalities are harmonious, in conflict, or c o m p l e m e n t a r y . Fxtravcrsion a n d introversion are just two a m o n g m a n y p e c u l i a r i t i e s of h u m a n b e h a v i o r . But they arc often rather obvious and easily recognizable. If one studies extraverted individuals, for instance, one soon discovers that they differ in m a n y ways from one a n o t h e r , a n d t h a t b e i n g e x t r a v e r t e d is t h e r e f o r e a s u p e r ficial a n d too general criterion to be really c h a r a c t e r i s t i c . T h a t is w h y , l o n g a g o , I tried to find some further basic peculiarities peculiarities that might serve the purpose of giving some order to the apparently limitless variations in human individuality.
I had always been impressed by the fact that there are a surprising n u m b e r of individuals w h o n e v e r use their m i n d s if they c a n avoid it, and an equal number who do use their minds, but in an amazingly stupid way. I was also s u r p r i s e d t o find m a n y i n t e l l i g e n t a n d w i d e awake people w h o lived (as far as one could m a k e o u t ) a s if t h e y h a d n e v e r l e a r n e d t o u s e their sense organs: T h e y did not see the things before their eyes, hear the words sounding in their ears, or notice the things they touched or tasted. Some lived without being aware of the state of their own bodies.



There were others who seemed to live in a most curious condition of consciousness, as if the state they had arrived at today were final, with no possibility of change, or as if the world and the psyche were static and would remain so forever. T h e y seemed devoid of all imagination, and they entirely and exclusively depended upon their sense-perception. Chances and possibilities did not exist in their world, and in " t o d a y " there was no real "tomorrow." The future was just the repetition of the past.
I am trying here to give the reader a glimpse of my own first impressions when I began to observe the many people I met. It soon became clear to me, however, that the people who used their minds were those who thought — that is, who applied their intellectual faculty in trying to adapt, themselves to people and circumstances. And the equally intelligent people who did not think were those who sought and found their way by feeling.
" F e e l i n g " is a word that needs some explanation. For instance, one speaks of "feeling" when it is a matter of " s e n t i m e n t " (corresponding to the French term sentiment). But one also applies the same word to define an opinion; for example, a communication from the White House may begin: " T h e President feels . . . . " Furthermore, the word may be used to express an intuition: " I had a feeling as if. . . . "
When I use the word "feeling" in contrast to "thinking," I refer to a j u d g m e n t of value for instance, agreeable or disagreeable, good or bad, and so on. Feeling according to this definition is not an emotion (which, as the word conveys, is involuntary). Feeling as I mean it is (like thinking) a rational (i.e. ordering) function, whereas intuition is an irrational (i.e. perceiving) function. In so far as intuition is a " h u n c h , " it is not the product of a voluntary act; it is rather an involuntary event, which depends upon different external or internal circumstances instead of an act of judgment. Intuition is more like a sense-perception, which is also an irrational event in so far as it depends essentially upon objective stimuli, which owe their existence to physical and not to mental causes.
These four functional types correspond to the obvious means by which consciousness obtains its orientation to experience. Sensation (i.e. sense-perception) tells you that something exists; thinking tells you what it is; feeling tells you whether it is agreeable or not; and intuition tells you whence it comes and where it is going. The reader should understand that these four criteria of types of human behavior are just four viewpoints among many others, like will power, temperament, imagination, memory, and so on. T h e r e is nothing dogmatic about them, but their basic nature recommends them as suitable criteria for a classification. I find them particularly helpful when I am called upon to explain parents to children and husbands to wives, and vice versa. They are also useful in understanding one's own prejudices.
Thus, if you want to understand another person's dream, you have to sacrifice your own predilections and suppress your prejudices. This is not easy or comfortable, because it means a moral effort that is not to everyone's taste. But if the analyst does not make the effort to criticize his own standpoint (and to admit its relativity, he will get neither the right information about, nor sufficient insight into, his patient's mind. The analyst expects at least a certain willingness on the patient's part to listen to his opinion and to take it seriously, and the patient must be granted the same right. Although such a relationship is indispensable for any understanding and is therefore of self-evident necessity, one must remind oneself again and again that it is more important in therapy for the patient to understand than for the analyst's theoretical expectations to be satisfied. The patient's resistance to the analyst's interpretation is not necessarily w r o n g ; it is rather a sure sign that something does not "click." Either the patient has not yet reached the point where he understands, or the interpretation does not fit.
In our efforts to interpret the dream symbols of another person, we are almost invariabl hampered by our tendency to fill in the unavoidable gaps in our understanding by projection that is, by the assumption that what the analyst perceives or thinks is equally per

ceived or thought by the dreamer. T o overcome this source of error, I have always insisted on the i m p o r t a n c e of sticking to the context of the particular d r e a m a n d excluding all theoretical assumptions about dreams in general—except for the hypothesis that d r e a m s in some way make sense. It will be clear from all I have said that we cannot lay d o w n general rules for interpreting dreams. When I suggested earlier that the overall function of d r e a m s seems to be to c o m p e n sate for deficiencies or distortions in the conscious mind, I meant that this assumption opened up the most promising approach to the n a t u r e o f particular d r e a m s . I n s o m e c a s e s y o u can see this function plainly demonstrated.
O n e of my patients had a very high opinion of himself and was u n a w a r e that almost everyone w h o knew him was irritated by his air of moral superiority. H e came to me with a dream in which he had seen a drunken t r a m p rolling in a ditch — a sight that evoked from him only the patronizing c o m m e n t : "It's terrible to see how low a m a n can fall." It was evident that the unpleasant nature of the d r e a m was at least in part an a t t e m p t to offset his inflated opinion of his o w n merits. But there was somet h i n g m o r e to it t h a n this. It t u r n e d o u t t h a t he had a brother who was a degenerate alcoholic. W h a t the dream also revealed was that his superior attitude was compensating the brother, as both an outer and an inner figure.
In another case I recall, a woman who was proud of her intelligent understanding of psychology had recurringdreams about another w o m a n . W h e n in o r d i n a r y life she m e t this w o m a n , she did not like her, thinking her a vain and dishonest intriguer. But in the dreams the w o m a n appeared almost as a sister, friendly and likeable. My patient could not understand why she should d r e a m so favorably a b o u t a person she disliked. But these dreams were trying to convey the idea that she herself was "shadowed" by an unconscious character that resembled the other w o m a n . It was h a r d for my patient, who had very clear ideas about her own personality, to realize that the dream was telling her about her own power complex and
her hidden motivations — unconscious influences that had more than once led to disagreeable rows with her friends. She had always blamed others for these, not herself. It is n o t m e r e l y t h e " s h a d o w " side of o u r p e r sonalities that we overlook, disregard, and repress. W e may also do the same to our positive q u a l i t i e s . A n e x a m p l e t h a t c o m e s to m i n d is that of an apparently modest and self-effacing man, with charming manners. He always seemed content with a back seat, but discreetly insisted on being present. W h e n asked to speak he would offer a well-informed opinion, though he never intruded it. But he sometimes hinted that a given matter could be dealt with in a far superior way at a certain higher level (though he never explained how).
In his dreams, however, he constantly had encounters with great historical figures, such as Napoleon and Alexander the Great. These d r e a m s were clearly c o m p e n s a t i n g for an inferiority complex. But they had another implication. W h a t sort of m a n must I be, the d r e a m was asking, to have such illustrious callers? In this respect the dreams pointed to a secret meg
62



alomania, which offset the d r e a m e r ' s feeling of inferiority. This unconscious idea of grandeur insulated him from the reality of his environment and enabled him to remain aloof from obligations that w o u l d be imperative for other people. H e felt no need to prove — either to himself or to others — that his superior j u d g ment was based on superior merit.
He was, in fact, unconsciously playing an insane game, and the dreams were seeking to bring it to the level of consciousness in a curiously a m b i g u o u s way. H o b n o b b i n g with N a p o leon and being on speaking terms with Alexander the Great are exactly the kind of fantasies produced by an inferiority complex. But why, one asks, could not the d r e a m be open a n d direct a b o u t it a n d say w h a t it h a d to say without a m b i g u i t y ?
I have frequently been asked this question, and I have asked it myself. I a m often surprised at the tantalizing w a y d r e a m s seem to evade definite information or omit the decisive point. Freud assumed the existence of a special function of the psyche, w h i c h he called the "censor." This, he supposed, twisted the dream
images and made them unrecognizable or misleading in order to deceive the dreaming consciousness about the real subject of the dream. By concealing the critical thought from the dreamer, the "censor" protected his sleep against the shock of a disagreeable reminiscence. But I am skeptical about the theory that the d r e a m is a g u a r d i a n of s l e e p ; d r e a m s j u s t as often disturb sleep.
It r a t h e r looks as if the a p p r o a c h to consciousness has a "blotting-out" effect u p o n the subliminal contents of the psyche. T h e subliminal state retains ideas and images at a much lower level of tension than they possess in consciousness. In the subliminal condition they lose clarity of definition; the relations between t h e m a r e less consequential a n d m o r e vaguely a n a l o g o u s , less rational a n d therefore m o r e " i n comprehensible." This can also be observed in all dreamlike conditions, whether due to fatigue, fever, or toxins. But if s o m e t h i n g h a p pens to endow any of these images with greater tension, they b e c o m e less subliminal a n d , as they come close to the threshold of consciousness, more sharply defined.
Left, a d o w n - a n d - o u t alcoholic in a New York slum (from the 1955 film On the Bowery). S u c h a f i g u r e m i g h t appear in the dreams of a man w h o felt himself to be superior to others. In this w a y his unconscious would be compensating for his conscious mind's onesidedness.
Right, The Nightmare, p a i n t e d b y the 18th-century Swiss-born artist Henry Fuseli. Almost everyone has been awakened, upset, or disturbed by his dreams; our sleep does not appear to be protected from the contents of the unconscious.



It is from this fact that one may understand why dreams often express themselves as analogies, why one dream image slides into another, and why neither the logic nor the time scale of our waking life seems to apply. The form that dreams take is natural to the unconscious because the material from which they are produced is retained in the subliminal state in precisely this fashion. Dreams do not guard sleep from what Freud called the "incompatible w i s h . " What he called " d i s g u i s e " is actually the shape all "impulses naturally take in the unconscious. Thus, a dream cannot produce a definite thought. If it begins to do so, it ceases to be a dream because it crosses the threshold of consciousness. T h a t is why dreams seem to skip the very points that are most important to the conscious mind, and seem rather to manifest the "fringe of consciousness," like the faint gleam of stars during a total eclipse of the sun.
We should understand that dream symbols are for the most part manifestations of a psyche that is beyond the control of the conscious mind. Meaning and purposefulness are not the prerogatives of the mind; they operate in the whole of living nature. There is no difference in principle between organic and psychic growth. As a plant produces its flower, so the psyche creates its symbols. Every dream is evidence of this process.
So, by means of dreams (plus all sorts of intuitions, impulses, and other spontaneous events), instinctive forces influence the activity of consciousness. Whether that influence is for better or for worse depends upon the actual contents of the unconscious. If it contains too many things that normally ought to be conscious, then its function becomes twisted and prejudiced; motives appear that are not based upon true instincts, but that owe their existence and psychic importance to the fact that they have been consigned to the unconscious by repression or neglect. T h e y overlay, as it were, the normal unconscious psyche and distort its natural tendency to express basic symbols and motifs. Therefore it is reasonable for a psychoanalyst, concerned with the causes of a mental disturbance, to begin by eliciting from his
patient a more or less voluntary confession and realization of everything that the patient dislikes or fears. This is like the much older confession of the Church, which in many ways anticipated modern psychological techniques. At least this is the general rule. In practice, however, it may work the other way round; overpowering feelings of inferiority or serious weakness may make it very difficult, even impossible, for the patient to face fresh evidence of his own inadequacy. So I have often found it profitable to begin by giving a positive outlook to the patient; this provides a helpful sense of security when he approaches the more painful insights.
Take as an example a dream of "personal exaltation" in which, for instance, one has tea with the queen of England, or finds oneself on intimate terms with the pope. If the dreamer is not a schizophrenic, the practical interpretation of the symbol depends very much upon his present state of mind — that is, the condition of his ego. If the dreamer overestimates his own value, it is easy to show (from the material produced by association of ideas) how inappropriate and childish the dreamer's intentions are, and how much they emanate from childish wishes to be equal to or superior to his parents. But if it is a case of inferiority, where an allpervading feeling of worthlessness has already overcome every positive aspect of the dreamer's personality, it would be quite wrong to depress him still more by showing how infantile, ridiculous, or even perverse he is. That would cruelly increase his inferiority, as well as cause an unwelcome and quite unnecessary resistance to the treatment.
T h e r e is no therapeutic technique or doctrine that is of general application, since every case that one receives for treatment is an individual in a specific condition. I remember a patient I once had to treat over a period of nine years.
Right, the heroic dreams with which Walter Mitty (in the 1947 film of JamesThurber's story) compensates his sense of inferiority.

I saw him only for a few weeks each year, since he lived abroad. From the start I knew what his real trouble was, but I also saw that the least attempt to get close to the truth was met by a violent defensive reaction that threatened a complete rupture between us. Whether I liked it or not, I h a d to d o m y best to m a i n t a i n o u r relation a n d to follow his inclination, which was supported by his dreams and which led our discussion away from the root of his neurosis. W e ranged so widely that I often accused myself of leading my patient astray. Nothing but the fact that his condition slowly but clearly improved prevented me from confronting him brutally with the truth.
In the 10th year, however, the patient declared himself to be cured and freed from all his s y m p t o m s . I was surprised because theoretically his condition was incurable. Noticing my astonishment, he smiled and said (in effect): " A n d I w a n t to thank you above all for your unfailing tact and patience in helping m e to circumvent the painful cause of my neurosis. I a m now ready to tell you everything about it.
If I h a d been able to talk freely a b o u t it, I w o u l d h a v e told you w h a t it was at m y first consultation. But that would have destroyed my rapport with you. Where should I have been then? I should have been morally bankrupt. In the course of 10 years I h a v e l e a r n e d to trust you; and as my confidence grew, my condition improved. I improved because this slow process restored my belief in myself. Now I a m strong enough to discuss the problem that was destroying me."
He then made a devastatingly frank confession of his problem, which showed me the reasons for the peculiar course our t r e a t m e n t had had to follow. T h e original shock had been such that alone he had been unable to face it. He needed the help of another, and the therapeutic task was the slow establishment of confidence, r a t h e r t h a n t h e d e m o n s t r a t i o n o f a clinical theory.
From cases like this I learned to a d a p t my methods to the needs of the individual patient, rather than to commit myself to general theoretical considerations that might be inapplicable

The archetype in dream symbolism
I have already suggested that dreams serve the purpose of compensation. This assumption means that the dream is a normal psychic phenomenon that transmits unconscious reactions orspontaneousimpulses to consciousness. Many dreams can be interpreted with the help of the dreamer, who provides both the associations to and the context of the dream image, by means of which one can look at all its aspects.
This method is adequate in all ordinary cases, such as those when a relative, a friend, or a patient tells you a dream more or less in the course of conversation. But when it is a matter of obsessive dreaming or of highly emotional dreams, the personal associations produced by the dreamer do not usually suffice for a satisfactory interpretation. In such cases, we have to take into consideration the fact (first observed and commented on by Freud J that elements often occur in a dream that are not individual and that cannot be derived from the dreamer's personal experience. These elements, as I have previously mentioned, are what Freud called "archaic remnants" mental forms whose presence cannot be explained by anything in the individual's own life and which seem to be aboriginal, innate, and inherited shapes of the human mind.
Just as the human body represents a whole museum of organs, each with a long evolutionary history behind it, so we should expect to find that the mind is organized in a similar way. It can no more be a product without history than is the body in which it exists. By "history" I do not mean the fact that the mind builds itself up by conscious reference to the past through language and other cultural traditions. I am referring to the biological, prehistoric, and unconscious development of the mind in archaic man, whose psyche was still close to that of the animal.
This immensely old psyche forms the basis of our mind, just as much as the structure of
our body is based on the general anatomical pattern of the mammal. The trained eye of the anatomist or the biologist finds many traces of this original pattern in our bodies. T h e experienced investigator of the mind can similarly see the analogies between the dream pictures of modern man and the products of the primitive mind, its "collective images," and its mythological motifs.
Just as the biologist needs the science of comparative anatomy, however, the psychologist cannot do without a " c o m p a r a t i v e anatomy of the psyche." In practice, to put it differently, the psychologist must have a sufficient experience not only of dreams and other products of unconscious activity, but also of mythology in its widest sense. Without this equipment, nobody can spot the important analogies; it is not possible, for instance, to see the analogy between a case of compulsion neurosis and that of a classical demonic possession without a working knowledge of both.
My views about the "archaic remnants," which I call "archetypes" or "primordial images," have been constantly criticized by people who lack a sufficient knowledge of the psychology of dreams and of mythology. T h e term " a r c h e t y p e " is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological images or motifs. But these are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited.
T h e archetype is a tendency to form such representations ofa motif—representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern. There are, for instance, many representations of the motif of the hostile brethren, but the motif itself remains the same. My critics have incorrectly assumed that I am dealing with "inherited representations," and on that ground they have dismissed the idea of the archetype as mere superstition. They have

failed to t a k e i n t o a c c o u n t t h e fact t h a t if archetypes were representations that originated in o u r c o n s c i o u s n e s s (or w e r e a c q u i r e d b y c o n sciousness), we should surely understand them, and not be bewildered and astonished when they present themselves in our consciousness. T h e y a r e , i n d e e d , a n i n s t i n c t i v e trend, a s marked as the impulse of birds to build nests, or ants to form organized colonies.
Here I must clarify the relation between instincts and archetypes: W h a t we properly call instincts are physiological urges, and are perceived by the senses. But at the same time, they also manifest themselves in fantasies a n d often reveal their presence only by symbolic images. These manifestations are what I call the archetypes. T h e y are without known origin; and they reproduce themselves in any time or in a n y p a r t of t h e w o r l d — e v e n w h e r e t r a n s mission by direct descent or "cross fertilization" through migration must be ruled out.
I can remember m a n y cases of people w h o have consulted me because they were baflled by their o w n d r e a m s or bv their children's. They were at a c o m p l e t e loss to u n d e r s t a n d the terms of the d r e a m s . T h e reason was that the dreams contained images that they could not
relate to anything they could remember or could have passed on to their children. Yet some of these patients were highly educated: A few of them were actually psychiatrists themselves. I vividly recall the case of a professor w h o had had a sudden vision and thought he was insane. H e c a m e to see m e in a state of c o m plete panic. I simply took a 400-year-old book from the shelf and showed him an old woodcut depicting his very vision. " T h e r e ' s no reason for you to believe that you're insane," I said to him. " T h e y knew about your vision 400 years ago." W h e r e u p o n he sat down entirely deflated, but once more normal.
A very important case came to me from a man who was himself a psychiatrist. One day he brought me a handwritten booklet he had received as a Christmas present from his 10\ e a r - o l d d a u g h t e r . It c o n t a i n e d a w h o l e series of d r e a m s s h e had had when she was eight. They m a d e up the weirdest series of dreams that I have ever seen, and I could well understand why the father was more than just puzzled by them. T h o u g h childlike, they were uncannv. and they contained images whose origin was whollv incomprehensible to the father.

Her dreams have a decidedly peculiar character. Their leading thoughts are markedly philosophic in concept. T h e first one, for instance, speaks of an evil monster killing other animals, but God gives rebirth to them all t h r o u g h a d i v i n e Apokatastasis, or restitution. In the W e s t e r n world this idea is k n o w n through the Christian tradition. It can be found in the Acts of the Apostles r n : 2 1 : "[Christ] whom the heaven must receive until the time of restitution of all things. . . ." T h e early Greek Fathers of the C h u r c h (for instance, Origen) particularly insisted upon the idea that, at the end of time, everything will be restored by the Redeemer to its original and perfect state. But, according to St. Matthew x v n : l l , there was already an old Jewish tradition that Elias "truly shall first c o m e , a n d restore all t h i n g s . " I C o r i n thians xv:22 refers to the same idea in the following words: "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be m a d e alive."
One might guess that the child had encountered this thought in her religious education.
But she had very little religious background. Her parents were Protestants in n a m e ; but in fact they knew the Bible only from hearsay. It is p a r t i c u l a r l y unlikely t h a t the r e c o n d i t e i m a g e of Apokataslasis h a d b e e n fully e x p l a i n e d to the girl. Certainly her father had never heard of this mythical idea. N i n e of the 12 d r e a m s a r e influenced by the theme of destruction and restoration. And none of these dreams shows traces of specific Christian education or influence. On the contrary, they are more closely related to primitive m y t h s . T h i s relation is c o r r o b o r a t e d by the other motif—the "cosmogonic myth" (the creation of the world and of man) that appears in the fourth a n d fifth d r e a m s . T h e s a m e c o n n e c tion is found in I C o r i n t h i a n s x v : 2 2 , which I have just quoted. In this passage too, Adam and Christ (death and resurrection) are linked together.
T h e general idea of Christ the Redeemer belongs to the world-wide and pre-Christ theme of the hero and rescuer who, although he has

been devoured by a monster, appears again in a miraculous way, having overcome whatever monster it was that swallowed him. When and where such a motif originated nobody knows. We do not even know how to go about investigating the problem. The one apparent certainty is that every g e n e r a t i o n seems to h a v e k n o w n it as a tradition h a n d e d down from some preceding time. T h u s we can safely assume that it "originated" at a period when man did not yet know that he possessed a hero myth; in an age, that is to say, w h e n h e did not yet consciously reflect on w h a t h e was saying. T h e h e r o figure is an a r c h e t y p e , w h i c h has existed since t i m e immemorial.
T h e p r o d u c t i o n of archetypes by children is especially significant, because one can sometimes be quite certain that a child has had no direct access to the tradition concerned. In this case, the girl's family had no more than a superficial acquaintance with the Christian tradition. Christian themes may, of course, be represented by such ideas as God, angels, hea
ven, hell, and evil. But the way in which they are treated by this child points to a totally non-Christian origin. Let us take the first d r e a m of the G o d w h o really consists of four gods, coming from the "four c o r n e r s . " T h e corners of w h a t ? T h e r e is no room mentioned in the dream. A room w o u l d not even fit in w i t h the p i c t u r e of w h a t is obviously a cosmic event, in which the U n i versal Being himself intervenes. The quaternity (or e l e m e n t of "fourness") itself is a s t r a n g e idea, but one that plays a great role in many religions and philosophies. In the Christian religion, it has been superseded by the Trinity, a notion that we must assume was known to the child. But who in an ordinary middle-class family of today would be likely to know of a divine q u a t e r n i t y ? It is an idea that was once fairly familiar among students of the Hermetic philosophy in the Middle Ages, but it petered out with the beginning of the 18th century, and it has been entirely obsolete for at least 200 years. W h e r e , then, did the little girl pick it u p ?

F r o m EzekieFs vision? But t h e r e is no C h r i s t i a n teaching that identifies the seraphim with God. The same question may he asked about the h o r n e d s e r p e n t . In the Bible, it is t r u e , t h e r e are many horned animals in the Book of Revelation, for instance. But all these seem to be q u a d r u p e d , a l t h o u g h their overlord is the d r a g o n , the G r e e k w o r d for w h i c h (drakon) also means serpent. The horned serpent appears in 1 6 t h - c e n t u r y L a t i n a l c h e m y as the quadricornulus serpens f o u r - h o r n e d s e r p e n t ) , a symbol of M e r c u r y a n d a n a n t a g o n i s t of the C h r i s t i a n Trinity. But this is an o b s c u r e reference. So far as I can discover, it is m a d e by only o n e a u t h o r ; a n d this child h a d n o m e a n s of k n o w ing it.
In the second d r e a m , a motif a p p e a r s that is definitely non-Christian and that contains a reversal of accepted values for instance, p a g a n dances by men in heaven and good deeds by angels in hell. This symbol suggests a relativity of moral values. Where did the child find such a revolutionary notion, worthy of Nietzsche's genius? These questions lead us to a n o t h e r : W h a t is the compensatory meaning of these dreams, to which the little girl obviously attributed so
much importance that she presented them to her father as a Christmas present? If the d r e a m e r had been a primitive medicine man, one could reasonably assume that they represent variations of the philosophical themes ol d e a t h , of resurrection or restitution, of the origin of the w o r l d , the c r e a t i o n of m a n . and the relativity of values. But one might give u p such d r e a m s as hopelessly difficult if one tried to interpret them from a personal level. They undoubtedly contain '"collective images." and they are in a way analogous to the doctrines taught to young people in primitive tribes when they are about to be initiated as men. At such times they learn about what God, or the gods, or the "founding" animals have done, how the world and man were created, how the end of the world will c o m e , a n d the m e a n i n g ol d e a t h . Is there any occasion when we, in Christian civilization, hand out similar instructions? There is: in adolescence. But many people begin to think again of things like this in old age. at the approach of death.
The little girl, as it h a p p e n e d , was in both these situations. She was approaching puberty and, at the same time, the end of her life. Little or n o t h i n g in the symbolism of h e r d r e a m s

Death and rebirth symbolism also appears in dreams at the end of life, when the approach of death casts a shadow before it.

points to the beginning of a normal adult life, but there are many allusions to destruction and restoration. W h e n I first r e a d h e r d r e a m s , indeed, I had the uncanny feeling that they suggested i m p e n d i n g disaster. T h e reason I felt like that was the peculiar n a t u r e of the compensation that I deduced from the symbolism. It was the opposite of what one would expect to find in the consciousness of a girl of t h a t age. These dreams open up a new and rather terrifying aspect of life a n d d e a t h . O n e would expect to find such i m a g e s in a n a g i n g person who looks back upon life, rather than to be given them by a child who would normally be looking forward. Their atmosphere recalls the old R o m a n saying, "Life is a short d r e a m , " rather than the joy and exuberance of its springtime. For this child's life was like a ver sacrum vovendum (vow of a v e r n a l sacrifice), as the R o m a n poet puts it. Experience shows that the u n k n o w n a p p r o a c h of d e a t h casts an adumbratio (an a n t i c i p a t o r y s h a d o w ; over the life a n d d r e a m s of the victim. Even the altar in Christian churches represents, on the one hand, a tomb and, on the other, a place of resurrection the t r a n s f o r m a t i o n of d e a t h into eternal life.
Such are the ideas that the dreams brought h o m e to the child. T h e y were a p r e p a r a t i o n for death, expressed through short stories, like the tales told at p r i m i t i v e initiations or the Koans of Z e n B u d d h i s m . T h i s message is unlike the orthodox Christian doctrine and more like ancient primitive thought. It seems to have originated outside historical tradition in the long-forgotten psychic sources that, since prehistoric times, have nourished philosophical and religious speculation a b o u t life a n d d e a t h . It was as if future events w e r e casting their shadow back by arousing in the child certain thought forms that, though normally dormant, describe or accompany the approach of a fatal issue. Although the specific shape in which they express themselves is m o r e or less personal, their g e n e r a l p a t t e r n is collective. T h e y a r e found everywhere and at all times, just as animal instincts vary a good deal in the different species and yet serve the same general purposes. We do not assume that each new-born animal creates its own instincts as an individual acquisition, and we must not suppose that human individuals invent their specific human ways with every new birth. Like the instincts, the collective t h o u g h t p a t t e r n s of the h u m a n mind are innate and inherited. They function, when the occasion arises, in more or less the same way in all of us.
Emotional manifestations, to which such thought patterns belong, are recognizably the same all over the earth. We can identify them even in animals, and the animals themselves understand one another in this respect, even though they may belong to different species. And what about insects, with their complicated s y m b i o t i c functions? Most of t h e m d o not even know their parents and have nobody to teach them. Why should one assume, then, that man is the only living b e i n g d e p r i v e d of specific instincts, or that his psyche is devoid of all traces of its evolution?
.Naturally, if you identify the psyche with consciousness, you can easily fall into the erroneous idea that man comes into the world with a psyche that is e m p t y , a n d t h a t in later years it c o n t a i n s n o t h i n g m o r e t h a n w h a t it has

learned by individual experience. But the psyche is m o r e t h a n consciousness. A n i m a l s have little consciousness, but many impulses and reactions that denote the existence of a psyche; and primitives do a lot of things whose m e a n i n g is u n k n o w n to t h e m . You may ask many civilized people in vain for the real meaning of the Christmas tree or of the Easter egg. T h e fact is, they do things without knowing why they do them. I am inclined to the view that things were generally done first and that it was only a long time afterward that somebody asked why they were d o n e . T h e m e d i c a l psychologist is constantly confronted with otherwise intelligent patients who behave in a peculiar and unpredictable way and who have no inkling of what they say or do. They are suddenly caught by unreasonable moods for which they themselves cannot account.
Superficially, such reactions and impulses seem to be of an intimately personal nature, and so we dismiss them as idiosyncratic behavior. In fact, they are based upon a preformed a n d e v e r - r e a d y instinctive system t h a t is characteristic of man. Thought forms, universally understandable gestures, and many attitudes follow a pattern that was established long before man developed a reflective consciousness. It is even conceivable that the early origins of man's capacity to reflect come from the painful c o n s e q u e n c e s of violent e m o t i o n a l clashes. Let me take, purely as an illustration of this point, the bushman who, in a moment of anger
and disappointment at his failure to catch any fish, strangles his m u c h beloved only son, a n d is then seized with i m m e n s e regret as he holds the little dead body in his arms. Such a man might r e m e m b e r this m o m e n t of pain for ever. We cannot know whether this kind of experience was actually the initial cause of the development of h u m a n consciousness. But there is no d o u b t that the shock of a similar e m o tional experience is often needed to m a k e people wake up and pay attention to what they a r e d o i n g . T h e r e is a famous case of a 13thc e n t u r y S p a n i s h h i d a l g o , R a i m o n Lull, w h o finally (after a long chase) succeeded in meeting the lady he admired at a secret rendezvous. She silently opened her dress and showed him her breast, rotten with cancer. The shock changed Lull's life; he eventually became an eminent theologian and one of the Church's greatest missionaries. In the case of such a sudden change one can often prove that an archetype has been at work for a long time in the unconscious, skillfully arranging circumstances that will lead to the crisis.
Such experiences seem to show that archetypal forms are not just static patterns. They are dynamic factors that manifest themselves in impulses, just as spontaneously as the instincts. Certain dreams, visions, or thoughts can suddenly appear; and however carefully one investigates, o n e c a n n o t find o u t w h a t causes them. This does not mean that they have no c a u s e ; they certainly have. But it is so remote or obscure that one c a n n o t see w h a t it is. In
Some dreams seem to predict the future (perhaps due to unconscious knowledge of future possibilities); thus dreams were long used as divination. In Greece the sick w o u l d ask the healing god Asklepios for a dream indicating a cure. Left, a relief depicts such a dream cure: A snake (the god's symbol) bites a man's diseased shoulder and the god (far left) heals the shoulder. Right, Constantine (an Italian painting c 1460) dreaming before a battle that was to make him Roman Emperor. He dreamed of the cross, a symbol of Christ, and a voice said: "In this sign conquer." He took the sign as his emblem, w o n the battle, and was thus converted to Christianity






such a case, one must wait either until the dream and its meaning are sufficiently understood, or until some external event occurs that will e x p l a i n the d r e a m . At the moment of the dream, this event may still lie in the future. But just as our conscious thoughts often occupy themselves with the future and its possibilities, so do the unconscious and its d r e a m s . There has long been a general belief t h a t the chief function of d r e a m s is p r o gnostication of the future. In antiquity, and as late as the Middle Ages, dreams played their part in medical prognosis. I can confirm by a modern dream the element of prognosis (or precognition that can be found in an old dream rpioted by Artemidorus of Daldis, in the second century A.O. A man dreamed that he saw his lather die in the flames of a house on (ire. Not long a f t e r w a r d s , he himself died in a phlegmon? (fire, or high lexer:, which I presume was pneumonia.
It so h a p p e n e d that a colleague of m i n e was once suffering from a deadly gangrenous fever in fact, a phlegmone. A former patient of his, who had no knowledge of the nature of his doctor's illness, dreamed that the doctor died in a great fire. At that time the d o c t o r had just entered a hospital and the disease was only beginning. The dreamer knew nothing but the bare fact that his doctor was ill and in a hospital. Three weeks later, the doctor died. As this example shows, dreams may have an anticipatory or prognostic aspect, and anybody trying to interpret them must take this into consideration, especially where an obviously meaningful dream does not provide a context
sufficient to explain it. Such a dream often comes right out of the b l u e , a n d o n e w o n d e r s w h a t could have p r o m p t e d it. O f course, if one knew its ulterior message, its cause would be clear. For it is only o u r consciousness that does not yet know; the unconscious seems already informed, and to have come to a conclusion that is expressed in the d r e a m . In fact, the unconscious seems to be able to examine and to draw conclusions from facts, much as consciousness does. It can even use certain facts, and anticipate their possible results, just because we a r e not conscious of t h e m .
But as far as one can make out from dreams, the unconscious makes its deliberations instinctively. The distinction is i m p o r t a n t . Logical analysis is the p r e r o g a t i v e of consciousness; we select with reason and knowledge. The unconscious, however, seems to be guided chiefly by instinctive trends, represented by corresponding thought forms that is. by the archetypes. A d o c t o r w h o is asked to describe the course of an illness will use such rational concepts as " i n f e c t i o n " or " f e v e r . " The d r e a m is more poetic. It presents the diseased body as a man's e a r t h l y house, a n d the fever as the fire that is destroying it.
As the above dream shows, the archetypal mind has handled the situation in the same way as it did in the time of Artemidorus. Something that is of a m o r e or less u n k n o w n n a t u r e has been intuitively grasped In the unconscious and submitted to an archetypal treatment. This suggests that, instead of the process of reasoning that conscious thought would have applied, the archetypal mind has stepped in and taken over
In a dream quoted from Artemidorus on this page, a burning house symbolizes a fever The human body is o f t e n represented as a h o u s e : Left, from an 18th-century Hebrew encyclopedia, the body and a house are compared in d e t a i l — t u r r e t s as ears, w i n d o w s as eyes, a furnace as stomach, etc. Right, in a cartoon by James Thurber, a henpecked husband sees his home and his wife as the same being



the task of prognostication. The archetypes thus have their own initiative and their own specific energy. These powers enable them both to produce a meaningful interpretation (in their own symbolic style) and to interfere in a given situation with their own impulses and their own thought formations. In this respect, they function like complexes; they come and go very much as they please, and often they obstruct or modify our conscious intentions in an e m b a r rassing way.
We can perceive the specific energv of archetypes when we experience the peculiar fascination that accompanies them. They seem to hold a special spell. Such a peculiar quality is also c h a r a c t e r i s t i c ol the personal c o m p l e x e s ; and just as personal complexes have their individual history, so do social complexes of an archetypal character. But while personal complexes never produce more than a personal bias, archetypes create myths, religions, and philosophies that influence and characterize whole nations and epochs of history. We regard the personal complexes as compensations for onesided or faulty attitudes of consciousness; in the saine way. myths of a religious nature can be interpreted as a sort of mental therapy for the sufferings and anxieties of mankind in general hunger, war, disease, old age, death.
The universal hero m y t h , lot e x a m p l e , always refers to a powerful man or god-man who vanquishes evil in the form of dragons, serpents, monsters, d e m o n s , a n d so on, a n d w h o liberates his people from destruction and death, fhe narration or ritual repetition of sacred texts and ceremonies, and the worship of such a
figure with dances, music, hymns, prayers, and sacrifices, grip the audience with numinous emotions (as if with magic spells) and exalt the individual to an identification with the hero. II we try to see such a situation with the eyes of a believer, we can perhaps understand how the ordinary man can be liberated from his personal impotence and misery and endowed (at least temporarily) with an almost superhuman quality. Often enough such a conviction will sustain him for a long time and give a certain style to his life. It m a y even set the tone of a w h o l e society. A r e m a r k a b l e instance of this can be found in the Eleusinian mysteries, which were finally suppressed at the beginning of the seventh century of the Christian era. They expressed, together with the Delphic oracle, the essence and spirit of ancient Greece. On a much greater scale, the Christian era itself owes its name and significance to the antique mystery of the god-man. which has its roots in the archetypal Osiris-Horus myth of ancient Egypt.
It is c o m m o n l y a s s u m e d that on s o m e given occasion in prehistoric times, the basic mythological ideas were "invented" by a clever old philosopher or prophet, and ever afterward "believed" by a credulous and uncritical p e o p l e . It is said t h a t stories told by a p o w e r seeking priesthood are not "true." but merely "'wishful thinking." But the very word "invent" is derived from the L a t i n invenirt, a n d m e a n s to " i i n d " and hence to find something by •"seeki n g " it. In the latter case the word itself hints at some foreknowledge of what you are going to find.
The energy of archetypes can be focused (through rituals and other appeals to mass emotion) to move people to collective action The Nazis knew this, and used versions of Teutonic m y t h s to help rally the country to their cause Far right, a propaganda painting of Hitler as a heroic crusader; right, a solstice festival celebrated in summer by the Hitler Youth, a revival of an ancient pagan festival

Top, a child's painting of Christmas includes the familiar tree decorated w i t h candles. The evergreen tree is connected with Christ through the symbolism of the winter solstice and the "new year" (the new aeon of Christianity) There are many links between Christ and the tree symbol: The cross is often seen as a tree, as in a medieval Italian fresco, left, of Christ crucified on the tree of knowledge. Candles in Christian ceremonies symbolize divine light, as in the Swedish festival of St Lucia (above), where girls wear crowns of burning candles.



Let me go back to the strange ideas contained in the dreams of the little girl. It seems unlikely that she sought them out, since she was surprised to find them. They occurred to her rather as peculiar and unexpected stories, which seemed noteworthy enough to be given to her father as a Christmas present. In doing so, however, she lifted them up into the sphere of our still living Christian m y s t e r y — t h e birth of our Lord, mixed with the secret of the evergreen tree t h a t carries the n e w - b o r n L i g h t . (This is the reference of the fifth d r e a m . )
A l t h o u g h t h e r e is a m p l e historical evidence for the s y m b o l i c r e l a t i o n b e t w e e n C h r i s t a n d the tree symbol, the little girl's parents would have been gravely embarrassed had they been asked to explain exactly what they meant by decorating a tree with burning candles to celebrate the nativity of Christ. " O h , it's just a Christmas custom!" they would have said. A serious answer would require a far-reaching dissertation about the antique symbolism of the dying god, and its relation to the cult of the Great Mother and her symbol, the tree—to mention only one aspect of this complicated problem. f
The further we delve into the origins of a "collective image" (or, to express it in ecclesiastical language, of a dogma), the more we uncover a seemingly unending web of archetypal patterns that, before modern times, were never the object of conscious reflection. Thus, paradoxically enough, we know more about mythological symbolism than did any generation before our own. T h e fact is that in former times men did not reflect upon their symbols; they lived them and were unconsciously a n i m a t e d by their meaning.
I will illustrate this by an experience I once had with the primitives of Mount Elgon in Africa. Every morning at dawn, they leave their huts and breathe or spit into their hands, which they t h e n stretch o u t to t h e first rays of the s u n , as if they w e r e offering e i t h e r their b r e a t h or their spittle to the rising god — to mungu. ( T h i s Swahili word, which they used in explaining the ritual act, is derived from a Polynesian root equivalent to mana or mulungu. T h e s e a n d
similar terms designate a " p o w e r " of extraordinary efficiency and pervasiveness, which we s h o u l d call d i v i n e . T h u s the w o r d mungu is their equivalent for Allah or God.) When I asked them what they meant by this act, or why they did it, they were completely baffled. They could only say: "We have always done it. It has always been done when the sun rises." They laughed at the obvious conclusion that the sun is mungu. T h e sun i n d e e d is not mungu w h e n it is a b o v e the h o r i z o n ; mungu is the a c t u a l moment of the sunrise.
What they were doing was obvious to me, but not to them; they just did it, never reflecting on what they did. They were consequently unable to explain themselves. I concluded that they w e r e offering t h e i r souls to mungu, because the b r e a t h (of life) and the spittle m e a n "soul-substance." To breathe or spit upon something conveys a " m a g i c a l " effect, as, for instance, when Christ used spittle to cure the blind, or where a son inhales his dying father's last breath in order to take over the father's soul. It is most unlikely that these Africans ever, even in the remote past, knew any more about the meaning of their ceremony. In fact, their ancestors probably knew even less, because they were even more profoundly unconscious of their motives a n d thought less about their doings.
G o e t h e ' s F a u s t a p t l y says: "Im Anfang war die Tat [ I n the b e g i n n i n g was t h e d e e d ] . " "Deeds" were never invented, they were done; thoughts, on the other hand, are a relatively late discovery of man. First he was moved to deeds by unconscious factors; it was only a long time afterward that he began to reflect upon the causes that had moved h i m ; and it took him a very long time indeed to arrive at the preposterous idea that he must have moved himself—his mind being unable to identify any other motivating force than his own. We should laugh at the idea of a plant or an animal inventing itself, yet there are many people who believe that the psyche or mind invented itself and thus was the creator of its own existence. As a matter of fact, the mind has grown to its present state of consciousness as an acorn grows into an oak or as saurians

developed into m a m m a l s . As it has for so long been developing, so it still develops, and thus we are moved by forces from within as well as by stimuli from without. These inner motives spring from a deep source t h a t is not m a d e by consciousness a n d is not under its control. In the mythology of earlier times, these forces w e r e called mana, or spirits, demons, and gods. They are as active today as they ever were. If they conform to our wishes, we call them happy hunches or impulses and pat ourselves on the back for being smart fellows. If they go against us, then we say that it is just b a d luck, or t h a t c e r t a i n p e o p l e a r e against us, or that the cause of our misfortunes must be pathological. T h e one thing we refuse to a d m i t is t h a t we a r e d e p e n d e n t u p o n "powers" that are beyond our control.
It is t r u e , h o w e v e r , t h a t in recent times civilized man has acquired a certain amount of will power, which he can apply where he pleases.

action without a hitch, whereas the primitive seems to be hampered at each step by fears, superstitions, and other unseen obstacles to action. The motto "Where there's a will, there's a w a y " is the superstition of m o d e r n m a n . Yet in order to sustain his creed, contemporary man pays the price in a remarkable lack of introspection. H e is blind to the fact t h a t , with all his rationality a n d efficiency, he is possessed by "powers" that are beyond his control. His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food and, above all, a large array of neuroses.

The soul of man
What we call civilized consciousness has steadily separated itself from the basic instincts. But these instincts have not disappeared. T h e y have merely lost their contact with our consciousness and are thus forced to assert themselves in an indirect fashion. This may be by means of physical symptoms in the case of a neurosis, or by means of i n c i d e n t s of v a r i o u s kinds, such as unaccountable moods, unexpected forgetfulness, or mistakes in speech.
A m a n likes to believe that he is the m a s t e r of his soul. But as long as he is u n a b l e to c o n t r o l his moods a n d e m o t i o n s , or to be conscious of the myriad secret ways in which unconscious factors insinuate themselves into his arrangements and decisions, he is certainly not his own master. These unconscious factors owe their existence to the autonomy of the archetypes. Modern man protects himself against seeing his own split state by a system of compartments. Certain areas of outer life a n d of his own behavior are kept, as it were, in separate
drawers and arc never confronted with one another. As an example of this so-called compartment psychology, I remember the case of an alcoholic who had come under the laudable influence of a certain religious movement, and, fascinated by its enthusiasm, had forgotten that he needed a drink. He was obviously and miraculously cured by Jesus, and he was correspondingly displayed as a witness to divine grace or to the efficiency of the said religious organization. But after a few weeks of p u b l i c confessions, the novelty began to pale and some alcoholic refreshment seemed to be indicated, and so he drank again. But this time the helpful organization came to the conclusion that the case was " p a t h o l o g i c a l " and obviously not suitable for an intervention by Jesus, so they put him into a clinic to let the doctor do better than the div ine healer.

alarming degree of dissociation and psychological confusion. If, for a m o m e n t , we r e g a r d m a n k i n d as o n e individual, we see t h a t the h u m a n race is like a person carried away by unconscious powers; and the h u m a n race also likes to keep certain problems tucked away in separate drawers. But this is why we s h o u l d give a g r e a t d e a l of consideration to what we are doing, for mankind is now t h r e a t e n e d by self-created a n d d e a d l y dangers that are growing beyond our control. Our world is, so to speak, dissociated like a neurotic, with the Iron Curtain marking the symbolic line of division. Western man, becoming aware of the aggressive will to power of the East, sees himself forced to take extraordinary measures of defense, at the same time as he prides himself on his virtue and good intentions.
What he fails to see is t h a t it is his o w n vices, which he has covered up by good international manners, that are thrown back in his face by the communist world, shamelessly and methodically. What the West has tolerated, but secretly and with a slight sense of shame (the diplomatic lie, systematic deception, veiled threats), comes back into the open and in full measure from the East and ties us up in neurotic knots. It is the face of his own evil shadow that grins at Western man from the other side of the I r o n C u r t a i n . It is this state of affairs t h a t explains the peculiar feeling of helplessness of so m a n y people in Western societies. They have begun to realize t h a t the difficulties confronting us are moral problems, and that the attempts to answer them by a policy of piling up nuclear arms or by e c o n o m i c " c o m p e t i t i o n " is achieving little, for it cuts both ways. M a n y of us now understand that moral a n d m e n t a l means would be more efficient, since they could provide us with psychic i m m u n i t y against the everincreasing infection.
"Our world is dissociated like a neurotic." Left, the Berlin Wall.
But all such attempts have proved singularly ineffective, and will do so as long as we try to c o n v i n c e ourselves a n d the world t h a t it is only they (i.e. o u r o p p o n e n t s ) w h o a r e w r o n g , ft would be much more to the point for us to make a serious attempt to recognize our own shadow and its nefarious doings. If we could see our shadow (the dark side of our nature), we should be immune to any moral and mental infection and insinuation. As matters now stand, we lay ourselves open to every infection, because we are really doing practically the s a m e t h i n g as they. O n l y we h a v e the a d d i tional disadvantage that we neither see nor want to understand what we ourselves are doing, under the cover of good manners.
The communist world, it may be noted, has one big myth (which we call an illusion, in the vain hope that our superior judgment will m a k e it d i s a p p e a r ) . It is the time-hallowed archetypal dream of a Golden Age (or Paradise), w h e r e e v e r y t h i n g is p r o v i d e d in a b u n d ance for everyone, and a great, just, and wise chief rules over a human kindergarten. This powerful archetype in its infantile form has gripped them, but it will never disappear from the world at the mere sight of our superior point of view. W e even support it by our own childishness, for o u r W e s t e r n civilization is in the grip of the same mythology. Unconsciously, we cherish the same prejudices, hopes, and expectations. We too believe in the welfare state, in universal peace, in the equality of man, in his eternal h u m a n rights, in justice, truth, and (do not say it too loudly) in the K i n g d o m of God on Earth.
T h e sad t r u t h is t h a t m a n ' s real life consists of a complex of inexorable opposites—day and night, birth and death, happiness and misery, good and evil. We are not even sure that one will prevail against the other, that good will o v e r c o m e evil, or j o y defeat p a i n . Life is a battleground. It always has been, and always will b e ; a n d if it were not so, existence would come to an end. It was precisely this conflict within man that led the early Christians to expect and hope for an early end to this world, or the Buddhists to

reject all earthly desires a n d aspirations. These basic answers would be frankly suicidal if they were not linked up with peculiar mental and moral ideas and practices that constitute the bulk of both religions a n d that, to a certain extent, modify their radical denial of the world. I stress this point because, in our time, there are millions of people who have lost faith in any kind of religion. Such people do not understand their religion any longer. While life runs smoothly without religion, the loss remains as good as unnoticed. But when suffering comes, it is a n o t h e r m a t t e r . T h a t is w h e n p e o p l e begin to seek a way out a n d to reflect a b o u t the meaning of life a n d its bewildering a n d painful experiences. It is significant t h a t the psychological d o c t o r (within my experience) is consulted m o r e by Jews and Protestants than by Catholics. This might be expected, for the Catholic C h u r c h still feels responsible for t h e cura animarum (the care and welfare of souls). But in this scientific age, the psychiatrist is a p t to be asked the questions that once belonged in the domain of the theologian. P e o p l e feel t h a t it m a k e s , or would make, a great difference if only they had a positive belief in a meaningful way of life or in God and i m m o r t a l i t y . T h e specter of a p proaching death often gives a powerful incentive to such thoughts. From time immemorial, men have had ideas about a Supreme Being (one or several) and about the L a n d of the
Hereafter. Only today do they think they can do without such ideas. Because we cannot discover God's throne in the sky with a radio telescope or establish (for certain) that a beloved father or m o t h e r is still about in a more or less corporeal form, people assume that such ideas are "not true." I would rather say that they are not "true" enough, for these a r e c o n c e p t i o n s of a kind that have a c c o m p a n i e d h u m a n life from prehistoric times, and that still break through into consciousness at any provocation. Modern man may assert that he can dispense with them, and he may bolster his o p i n i o n by insisting that t h e r e is no scientific evidence of their truth. O r he may even regret the loss of his convictions. But since we are dealing with invisible and unknowable things (for G o d is b e y o n d h u m a n u n d e r s t a n d ing, a n d there is no m e a n s of proving i m m o r tality), why should we bother about evidence? Even if we did not k n o w by reason o u r need for salt in our food, we should nonetheless profit from its use. We might argue that the use of salt is a m e r e illusion of taste or a superstition; but it would still contribute to our well-being. Why, then, should we deprive ourselves of views that would prove helpful in crises and would give a meaning to our existence?
And how do we know that such ideas are not true? Many people would agree with me

if I stated flatly t h a t such ideas a r e p r o b a b l y illusions. W h a t they fail to realize is t h a t the denial is as impossible to " p r o v e " as the assertion of religious belief. We are entirely free to choose w h i c h point of view we t a k e ; it will in a n y case be a n a r b i t r a r y decision. There is, however, a strong empirical reason why we should cultivate thoughts that can never be p r o v e d . It is t h a t they a r e k n o w n to be useful. M a n positively needs general ideas and convictions that will give a meaning to his life a n d e n a b l e him to find a p l a c e for himself in the universe. He can stand the most incredible h a r d s h i p s w h e n he is c o n v i n c e d that they m a k e sense; he is c r u s h e d w h e n , on t o p of all his misfortunes, h e has to a d m i t t h a t he is taking p a r t in a " t a l e told by a n i d i o t . "
It is the role of religious symbols to give a meaning to the life of m a n . T h e Pueblo Indians believe that they are the sons of Father Sun, a n d this belief endows their life with a perspective (and a goal) that goes far beyond their limited existence. It gives them ample space for the unfolding of personality and permits them a full life as complete persons. T h e i r plight is infinitely m o r e satisfactory than that of a man in our own civilization who knows t h a t he is (and will r e m a i n ) nothing more than an underdog with no inner meaning to his life.
A sense of a w i d e r m e a n i n g to one's existence is w h a t raises a m a n b e y o n d m e r e g e t t i n g and s p e n d i n g . If he lacks this sense, he is lost and miserable. H a d St. Paul been convinced that he was nothing more than a

Religious symbols and beliefs of every kind give meaning to men's lives ancient peoples grieved over death (right, an Egyptian figurine representing mourning, which was found in a t o m b ) ; yet their beliefs made them also think of death as a positive transformation.
wandering tent-maker he certainly would not have been the man he was. His real a n d meaningful life lay in the i n n e r certainty that he was the messenger of the Lord. O n e m a y accuse him of suffering from m e g a l o mania, but this opinion pales before the testim o n y of history a n d the j u d g m e n t of s u b sequent generations. The myth that took possession of him made him something greater than a mere craftsman.
Such a myth, however, consists of symbols that have not been invented consciously. They have h a p p e n e d . It was not the m a n Jesus who created the myth of the god-man. It existed for m a n y centuries before his birth. He himself was seized by this symbolic idea, which, as St. Mark tells us, lifted him out of the n a r r o w life of the N a z a r e n e c a r p e n t e r .



Myths go back to the primitive storyteller and his dreams, to men moved by the stirring of their fantasies. These people were not very different from those whom later generations have called poets or philosophers. Primitive storytellers did not concern themselves with the origin of their fantasies; it was very much later that people began to wonder where a story originated. Vet. centuries ago, in what we now call "ancient"" Greece, men's minds were advanced enough t o surmise that the tales of the gods were nothing but archaic and exaggerated traditions o f long-buried kings or chieftains. Men already t o o k t h e view that the m y t h was too i m p r o b a b l e to m e a n what it said. T h e y therefore tried to r e d u c e it to a generally understandable form.
In more recent times, we have seen the same thing happen with dream symbolism. We became aware, in the years when psychology was in its infancy, that dreams had some importance. But just as the Greeks persuaded themselves that their myths were merely elaborations of rational or " n o r m a l " history, so some of the pioneers of psychology came to the conclusion that dreams did not mean what they appeared to mean. The images or symbols that they presented were dismissed as bizarre forms in which repressed contents o f the psyche a p p e a r e d to the c o n s c i o u s m i n d . It t h u s c a m e to be taken for granted that a d r e a m meant something other than its obvious statement.
I have already described my disagreement with this idea — a disagreement that led mc to study the form as well as the content of dreams. Why should they mean something different from their contents? Is there anyt h i n g in n a t u r e t h a t is o t h e r t h a n it is? T h e d r e a m is a n o r m a l a n d n a t u r a l p h e n o m e n o n , a n d it does not m e a n s o m e t h i n g it is not. T h e T a l m u d even says: " T h e d r e a m is its o w n interpretation." The confusion arises because the dream's contents are symbolic and thus have more than one meaning. The symbols point in different directions from those we apprehend with the conscious mind; and therefore they relate to something either unconscious or at least not entirely conscious.
Above, a child's drawing of a tree ( w i t h the sun above it). A tree is one of the best examples of a motif that often appears in dreams (and elsewhere) and that can have an incredible variety of m e a n i n g s . It might symbolize evolution, physical growth, or psychological maturation; it m i g h t s y m b o l i z e sacrifice or death (Christ's crucifixion on the tree); it m i g h t be a phallic s y m b o l ; it m i g h t be a great deal more. A n d such other common dream motifs as t h e cross ( r i g h t ) or t h e lingam (far right) can also have a vast array of symbolic meanings.

To the scientific mind, such phenomena as symbolic ideas are a nuisance because they c a n n o t be f o r m u l a t e d in a w a y that is satisfactory to intellect and logic. They are by no means the only case of this kind in psychology. The trouble begins with the phenomenon of "affect" or emotion, which evades all the attempts of the psychologist to pin it d o w n with a final definition. T h e cause of t h e difficulty is the s a m e in b o t h cases — the i n t e r v e n tion of the unconscious. I know e n o u g h of the scientific point of view to u n d e r s t a n d t h a t it is most a n n o y i n g to have to deal with facts that cannot be completely or adequately grasped. The trouble with these p h e n o m e n a is t h a t the facts a r e undeniable and yet cannot be formulated in intellectual terms. For this one would have to be able to c o m p r e h e n d life itself, for it is life that produces emotions and symbolic ideas. T h e a c a d e m i c psychologist is perfectly free to dismiss the phenomenon of emotion or the concept of the unconscious (or both) from his consideration. Yet they remain facts to which the medical psychologist at least has to pay due attention; for emotional conflicts and the intervention of the unconscious are the classical features of his science. If he treats a p a t i e n t at all, he comes up against these irrationalities as
hard facts, irrespective of his ability to formulate them in intellectual terms. It is. therefore, epiite natural that people who have not had the m e d i c a l psychologist's e x p e r i e n c e find it difficult to follow what happens when psychology ceases to be a t r a n q u i l pursuit for the scientist in his l a b o r a t o r y a n d becomes an active part of the a d v e n t u r e of real life. Target practice on a s h o o t i n g r a n g e is far from the battlefield; the doctor has to deal with casualties in a genuine war. He must concern himself with psychic realities, even if he c a n n o t e m b o d y t h e m in scientific definitions. T h a t is why no textbook can teach psychology; one learns only by actual experience.
We can see this point clearly when we examine certain well-known symbols: T h e cross in the Christian religion, for instance, is a meaningful symbol t h a t expresses a multitude of aspects, ideas, and emotions: but a cross after a n a m e on a list simply indicates t h a t the i n d i v i d u a l is d e a d . T h e p h a l l u s functions as an all-embracing symbol in the H i n d u religion, but if a street u r c h i n d r a w s one on a wall, it just reflects an interest in his penis. Because infantile and adolescent fantasies often continue far into adult life, many dreams occur in which there are unmistakable sexual allusions. It would be absurd to under
9i



stand them as anything else. But when a mason speaks of monks and nuns to be laid upon each other, or an electrician of male plugs and female sockets, it would be ludicrous to suppose t h a t he is i n d u l g i n g in g l o w i n g adolescent fantasies. H e is simply using colorful descriptive names for his materials. W h e n an educated Hindu talks to you about the lingam (the phallus that represents the god Siva in Hindu mythology), you will hear things we Westerners would never connect with the penis. T h e l i n g a m is certainly not a n obscene allusion; n o r is the cross m e r e l y a sign of death. Much depends upon the maturity of the dreamer who produces such an image.
T h e interpretation of dreams and symbols demands intelligence. It cannot be turned into a mechanical system and then crammed into unimaginative brains. It demands both an increasing knowledge of the dreamer's individuality and an increasing self-awareness on the part of the interpreter. No experienced w o r k e r in this field will d e n y t h a t t h e r e a r e rules of t h u m b that can prove helpful, but they must be applied with prudence and intelligence. One may follow all the right rules and yet get bogged down in the most appalling nonsense, simply by overlooking a seemingly unimportant detail that a better intelligence would not have missed. Even a man of high intellect can go badly astray for lack of intuition or feeling.
When we attempt to understand symbols, we are not only confronted with the symbol itself, but we are b r o u g h t u p against the wholeness of the symbol-producing individual. This includes a study of his cultural backg r o u n d , a n d in t h e process o n e fills in m a n y gaps in one's own education. I have m a d e it a rule myself to consider every case as an entirely new proposition about which I do not even know the ABC. Routine responses may be practical and useful while one is dealing with the surface, but as soon as one gets in touch with the vital problems, life itself takes over and even the most brilliant theoretical premises become ineffectual words.
Imagination and intuition are vital to our understanding. And though the usual popular
o p i n i o n is t h a t they a r e chiefly v a l u a b l e to poets and artists (that in "sensible" matters one should mistrust them), they are in fact equally vital in all the higher grades of science. Here they play an increasingly important role, which supplements that of the " r a t i o n a l " intellect and its application to a specific problem. Even physics, the strictest of all applied sciences, depends to an astonishing degree upon intuition, which works by way of the unconscious ( a l t h o u g h it is possible to d e m o n s t r a t e afterward the logical procedures that could have led one to the same result as intuition).
I n t u i t i o n is almost i n d i s p e n s a b l e in the interpretation of symbols, and it can often ensure that they are immediately understood by the dreamer. But while such a lucky hunch may be subjectively convincing, it can also be rather dangerous. It can so easily lead to a false feeling of security. It may, for instance, seduce both the interpreter and the dreamer into continuing a cosy and relatively easy relation, which may end in a sort of shared dream. T h e safe basis of real intellectual knowledge a n d m o r a l u n d e r s t a n d i n g gets lost if one is content with the vague satisfaction of having understood by "hunch." One can explain and know only if one has reduced intuitions to an exact knowledge of facts and their logical connections.
An honest investigator will have to admit that he cannot always do this, but it would be dishonest not to keep it always in mind. Even a scientist is a h u m a n being. So it is natural for him, like others, to hate the things he c a n n o t e x p l a i n . It is a c o m m o n illusion to believe t h a t w h a t we k n o w t o d a y is all we ever can k n o w . N o t h i n g is m o r e v u l n e r a b l e t h a n scientific t h e o r y , w h i c h is a n e p h e m e r a l attempt to explain facts and not an everlasting truth in itself.

Ancient mythological beings are now curiosities in museums (right). But the archetypes they expressed have not lost their power to affect men's minds. Perhaps the monsters of modern "horror" films (far right) are distorted versions of archetypes that will no longer be repressed.



The role of symbols
When the medical psychologist takes an interest in symbols, he is primarily concerned with "natural" symbols, as distinct from "cultural" symbols. The former are derived from the unconscious c o n t e n t s of the p s y c h e , a n d they therefore represent an enormous n u m b e r of variations on the essential archetypal images. In many cases they can still be traced back to their archaic roots i.e. to ideas and images that we meet in the most ancient records and in primitive societies. T h e cultural symbols, on the other hand, are those that have been used to express "eternal truths," and that are still used in m a n y religions. T h e y have gone through many transformations and even a long process of more or less conscious development, and have thus become collective images accepted by civilized societies.
Such cultural symbols nevertheless retain much of their original numinosity or "spell." O n e is a w a r e that they c a n evoke a d e e p e m o tional response in some individuals, and this psychic change makes them function in much the same way as prejudices. They are a factor with which the psychologist must r e c k o n ; it is folly to dismiss t h e m because, in rational terms, they seem to be absurd or irrelevant. They are important constituents of our mental make-up
a n d vital forces in the b u i l d i n g u p of h u m a n society; and they cannot be eradicated without serious loss. Where they are repressed or neglected, their specific cnergv disappears into the unconscious with unaccountable consequences. The psychic energy that appears to have been lost in this way in fact serves to revive and intensify w h a t e v e r is u p p e r m o s t in the u n c o n scious— tendencies, perhaps, that have hitherto had no chance to express themselves or at least have not been allowed an uninhibited existence in our consciousness.
Such tendencies form an ever-present and potentially destructive "shadow" to our conscious mind. Even tendencies that might in some circumstances be able to exert a beneficial influence are transformed into demons when they a r e repressed. T h i s is w h y m a n y wellmeaning people are understandably afraid of the unconscious, and incidentally of psychology. O u r times have demonstrated what it means for the gates of the underworld to be opened. Things whose enormity nobody could have imagined in the idyllic harmlessness of the first decade of our century have happened and have turned our world upside down. Ever since, the world has remained in a state of schizophrenia. Not only has civilized G e r m a n y disgorged its
93



terrible p r i m i t i v i t y , but Russia is also ruled by it, and Africa has been set on fire. No wonder that the Western world feels uneasy. Modern man does not understand how much his "rationalism" (which hasdestroyed his capacity to respond to numinous symbols and ideas I has put him at the mercy of the psychic "underworld." He has freed himself frqm "superstition" (orsohe believes), but in the process he has lost his spiritual values to a positively dangerous degree. His moral and spiritual tradition has d i s i n t e g r a t e d , a n d he is now p a y i n g the price for this b r e a k - u p in world-wide disorientation and dissociation. Anthropologists have often described what happens to a primitive society when its spiritual values are exposed to the impact of modern civilization. Its people lose the meaning of their lives, theirsocial organization disintegrates, and they themselves morally decay. We are now in the same condition. But we have never really understood what we have lost, for our spiritual leaders unfortunately were more interested in protecting their institutions than in understanding the mystery that symbols present. In my opinion, faith docs not exclude thought (which
is m a n ' s strongest w e a p o n ) , b u t u n f o r t u n a t e l y many believers seem to be so afraid of science (and incidentally of psychology) that they turn a blind eye to the numinous psychic powers that forever control man's fate. We have stripped all things of their mystery a n d n u m i n o s i t y : n o t h i n g is holy a n y longer. In earlier ages, as instinctive concepts welled up in the mind of man, his conscious mind could no doubt integrate them into a coherent psychic p a t t e r n . But the " c i v i l i z e d " m a n is no longer able to do this. His "advanced" consciousness has deprived itself of the means by which the auxiliary contributions of the instincts and the unconscious can be assimilated. These organs of assimilation and integration were numinous symbols, held holy by common consent.
T o d a y , for instance, we talk of " m a t t e r . " We describe its physical properties. We conduct laboratory experiments to d e m o n s t r a t e some ol its aspects. But the word " m a t t e r " remains a dry, inhuman, and purely intellectual concept, without any psychic significance for us. How different was the former image of matter the Great Mother that could encompass and cx
94



press the profound emotional meaning of Mother Earth. In the same way, what was the spirit is now identified with intellect a n d thus ceases to be the Father of All. It has degenerated to the limited ego-thoughts of m a n ; the immense emotional energy expressed in the image of " o u r F a t h e r " vanishes into the sand of an intellectual desert. These two archetypal principles lie at the foundation of the contrasting systems of East and West. The masses and their leaders do not realize, however, t h a t there is no substantial difference between calling the world principle male and a father (spirit), as the West does, or female and a mother (matter), as the Communists do. Essentially, we know as little of the one as of the other. In earlier times, these principles were worshiped in all sorts of rituals, which at least showed the psychic significance they held for m a n . But now they have become mere abstract concepts.
As scientific understanding has grown, so our world has become d e h u m a n i z e d . M a n feels himself isolated in the cosmos, b e c a u s e he is no longer involved in nature and has lost his emotional "unconscious identity" with natural phenomena. These have slowly lost their symbolic implications. T h u n d e r is no longer the voice of an a n g r y god, n o r is l i g h t n i n g his a v e n g i n g missile. N o river contains a spirit, no tree is the life principle of a m a n , no snake the e m b o d i ment of wisdom, no mountain cave the home of a great d e m o n . No voices now speak to man from stones, plants, and animals, nor does he speak to them believing they can hear.

This e n o r m o u s loss is c o m p e n s a t e d for by the symbols of our dreams. They bring up our original nature its instincts and peculiar thinking. Unfortunately, however, they express their contents in the language of nature, which is s t r a n g e a n d i n c o m p r e h e n s i b l e to us. It t h e r e fore confronts us with the task of t r a n s l a t i n g it into the rational words and concepts of modern speech, which has liberated itself from its primitive encumbrances notably from its mystical p a r t i c i p a t i o n with the things it describes. Nowadays, when we talk of ghosts and other numinous figures, we a r e n o l o n g e r c o n j u r i n g t h e m up. 'The power as well as the glory is d r a i n e d out of such once-potent words. We have ceased to believe in magic formulas; not many taboos and similar restrictions are left; and our world seems to be disinfected of all such "superstitious" minima as "witches, warlocks, and worricows," to say n o t h i n g ol werewolves, v a m p i r e s , bush souls, and all the other bizarre beings that populated the primeval forest.

fiction a b o u t it) is also freed from p r i m i t i v i t y is a n o t h e r q u e s t i o n . Is the n u m b e r 13 n o t still taboo for m a n y people? Are there not still many individuals possessed by irrational prejudices, projections, and childish illusions? A realistic picture of the h u m a n mind reveals many such primitive traits and survivals, which are still playing their roles just as if n o t h i n g h a d happened during the last 500 years. It is essential to a p p r e c i a t e this point. M o d e r n m a n is in fact a curious m i x t u r e of c h a r a c t e r i s tics acquired over the long ages of his mental d e v e l o p m e n t . This m i x e d - u p being is the m a n and his symbols that we have to deal with, and we must scrutinize his mental products very carefully indeed. Skepticism and scientific conviction exist in him side by side with old-fashioned prejudices, outdated habits of thought and feeling, obstinate misinterpretations, and blind ignorance.
Such are the contemporary human beings who produce the symbols we psychologists investigate. In order to explain these symbols a n d their m e a n i n g , it is vital to l e a r n w h e t h e r their representations are related to purely personal experience, or whether they have been chosen by a d r e a m for its particular purpose from a store of general conscious knowledge.
Take, for instance, a d r e a m in which the n u m b e r 13 occurs. T h e question is w h e t h e r the dreamer himself habitually believes in the unlucky quality of the number, or whether the dream merely alludes to people who still indulge in such superstitions. The answer makes a great difference to the interpretation. In the former case, you have to reckon with the fact that the individual is still u n d e r the spell of the unlucky 13, and therefore will feel most uncomfortable in R o o m 13 in a hotel or sitting at a table with 13 people. I n the latter case, 13 may not mean any more than a discourteous or abusive remark. The "superstitious" dreamer still feels the " s p e l l " of 13; the more " r a t i o n a l " d r e a m e r has stripped 13 of its original emotional overtones.
This argument illustrates the way in which archetypes appear in practical experience: They are, at the same time, both images and
emotions. O n e can speak of an archetype only when these two aspects are simultaneous. When t h e r e is m e r e l y the i m a g e , t h e n t h e r e is simply a word-picture of little consequence. But by being charged with emotion, the image gains numinosity (or psychic energy); it becomes dynamic, and consequences of some kind must flow from it. I a m a w a r e t h a t it is difficult to g r a s p this concept, because I am trying to use words to describe something whose very nature makes it incapable of precise definition. But since so many people have chosen to treat archetypes as if they were p a r t of a m e c h a n i c a l system t h a t c a n be l e a r n e d by rote, it is essential to insist that they are not mere names, or even philosophical concepts. T h e y are pieces of life itself- images that are integrally connected to the living individual by the bridge of the emotions. T h a t is w h y it is impossible to give an arbitrary (or universal) interpretation of any archetype. It must be explained in the manner indicated by the whole life-situation of the particular individual to whom it relates.
Thus, in the case of a devout Christian, the symbol of the cross can be interpreted only in its Christian context — unless the dream produces a very strong reason to look beyond it. Even then, the specific Christian meaning should be kept in mind. But one cannot say that, at all times and in all circumstances, the symbol of the cross has the same meaning. If that were so, it would be stripped of its numinosity, lose its vitality, and become a mere word.
Those who do not realize the special feeling tone of the archetype end with nothing more than a j u m b l e of mythological concepts, which can be strung together to show that everything means anything — or nothing at all. All the corpses in the world are chemically identical, but living individuals are not. Archetypes come to life only w h e n one patiently tries to discover why and in what fashion they are meaningful to a living individual. T h e m e r e use of words is futile w h e n you do not k n o w w h a t they s t a n d for. T h i s is p a r t i c u larly true in psychology, where we speak of archetypes such as the anima and animus, the wise

man. the Great Mother, and so on. You can know all about the saints, sages, prophets, and other godly men, and all the great mothers of the world. But if they a r e m e r e images whose numinosity you have never experienced, it will be as if you were talking in a d r e a m , for you will not know what you are talking about. T h e mere words you use will be empty and valueless. T h e y gain life a n d m e a n i n g only w h e n you try to take into account their numinosity — i.e. their relationship to the living individual. Only then do you begin to understand that their names mean very little, whereas the way they are related to you is a l l - i m p o r t a n t .
The symbol-producing function of our d r e a m s is thus a n a t t e m p t to b r i n g the original mind of man into "advanced'" or differentiated consciousness, where it has never been before a n d where, therefore, it has never been subjected to critical self-reflection. For, in ages long past, that original mind was the whole of man's personality. As he developed consciousness, so his conscious mind lost contact with some of that primitive psychic energy. And the conscious mind has never known that original mind; for it was d i s c a r d e d in the process of evolving the very differentiated consciousness that alone could be aware of it.
Yet it seems t h a t w h a t we call the u n c o n scious has preserved primitive characteristics that formed p a r t of the original m i n d . It is to
these characteristics that the symbols of dreams constantly refer, as if the unconscious sought to bring back all the old things from which the mind freed itself as it evolved illusions, fantasies, archaic thought forms, fundamental instincts, and so on. This is w h a t explains the resistance, even fear, that people often experience in approaching unconscious matters. These relict contents are not merely neutral or indifferent. On the contrary, they are so highly charged that they are often more than merely uncomfortable. They can cause real fear. The more they are repressed, the more they spread through the whole personality in the form of a neurosis. It is this psychic e n e r g y t h a t gives t h e m such vital i m p o r t a n c e . It is just as if a m a n w h o has lived through a period of unconsciousness should s u d d e n l y realize that t h e r e is a g a p in his memory — that important events seem to have taken place that he cannot remember. In so far as he assumes t h a t the psyche is an exclusively personal affair (and this is the usual assumption), he will try to retrieve the apparently lost infantile memories. But the gaps in his childhood memory are merely the symptoms of a much greater loss the loss of the primitive psyche.
As the evolution of the e m b r y o n i c b o d y repeats its prehistory, so the mind also develops through a series of prehistoric stages. The main
98



task of d r e a m s is to b r i n g b a r k a sort b f " r e c o l lection" of the prehistoric, as well as the infantile world, right down to the level of the most primitive instincts. Such recollections can have a remarkably healing effect in certain cases, as Freud saw long ago. This observation confirms the view that an infantile memory gap (a socalled amnesia) represents a positive loss and its recovery can b r i n g a positive increase in life and well-being. Because a child is physically small a n d its conscious thoughts are scarce and simple, we do not realize the far-reaching complications ol the infantile mind that are based on its original identity with the prehistoric psyche. That "original m i n d " is just as m u c h present a n d still functioning in the child as the e v o l u t i o n a r y stages of m a n k i n d are in its e m b r y o n i c body. II the r e a d e r r e m e m b e r s w h a t I said earlier about the r e m a r k a b l e d r e a m s ol the child who made a present of her dreams to her father, he will get a good idea of w h a t 1 m e a n . In infantile amnesia, one findsstrange mythological fragments that also often a p p e a r in later psychoses. Images of this kind are highly numinous and therefore verv important. If such recollections reappear in adult life, they may in some cases cause profound psychological disturbance, while in other people they can produce miracles of healing or religious conversions. Often they bring back a piece of life,
missing for a long time, that gives purpose to and thus enriches h u m a n life. The recollection of infantile memories and the reproduction of archetypal ways of psychic behavior can create a wider horizon and a greater extension of consciousness on condition that one succeeds in assimilating and integrating in the conscious mind the lost and regained contents. Since they arc not neutral, their assimilation will modify the personality, just as they themselves will have to undergo c e r t a i n a l t e r a t i o n s . In this p a r t of w h a t is called "the individuation process" (which Dr. M.-L. von Franz describes in a later section of this b o o k ) , the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of svmbols plavs a n important practical role. For the symbols are natural attempts to reconcile and unite opposites within the psyche.
Naturally, just seeing and then brushing aside the symbols would have no such effect and would merely re-establish the old neurotic condition and destroy the attempt at a synthesis. Bttt. unfortunately, those rare people who do not deny the very existence of the archetypes almost invariably treat them as mere words and forget their living reality. When their numinosity has thus (illegitimately) been banished, the process of limitless s u b s t i t u t i o n begins in o t h e r words, one glides easily from archetype to archetype, with everything meaning everything. It is t r u e e n o u g h t h a t the forms of a r c h e types are to a considerable extent exchangeable. But their n u m i n o s i t y is a n d r e m a i n s a fact, a n d represents the value of an a r c h e t y p a l event.
This emotional value must be kept in mind and allowed for t h r o u g h o u t the whole intellectual process of d r e a m i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . It is only too easy to lose this value, because thinking and feeling are so diametrically opposed that thinking almost automatically throws out feeling values a n d vice versa. Psychology is the only science that has to take the factor of value (i.e. feeling) into a c c o u n t , because it is the link between physical events and life. Psychology is often accused of not b e i n g scientific on this a c c o u n t ; but its critics fail to u n d e r s t a n d the scientific and practical necessity of giving due consideration to feeling.

Healing the split
Our intellect has created a new world that dominates nature, and has populated it with monstrous machines. T h e latter are so indubitably useful that we cannot see even a possibility of getting rid of them or our subservience to t h e m . M a n is b o u n d to follow t h e a d v e n t u r ous promptings of his scientific and inventive mind and to admire himself for his splendid achievements. At the same time, his genius shows the uncanny tendency to invent things that become more and more dangerous, because they represent better and better means for wholesale suicide.
In view of the rapidly increasing avalanche of world p o p u l a t i o n , m a n has a l r e a d y b e g u n to seek ways a n d means of keeping the rising flood at bay. But nature may anticipate all our attempts by turning against man his own creative mind. T h e H - b o m b , for instance, would put an effective stop to overpopulation. In spite of o u r p r o u d d o m i n a t i o n of n a t u r e , we a r e still her victims, for we have not even learned to control our own nature. Slowly but, it appears, inevitably, we are courting disaster.
There are no longer any gods whom we can invoke to help us. T h e great religions of the world suffer from increasing anemia, because the helpful n u m i n a have fled from the woods, rivers, and mountains, and from animals, and the god-men have disappeared underground into the unconscious.

By the aid of reason, so we assure ourselves, we have "conquered nature." But this is a m e r e slogan, for the so-called conquest of nature overwhelms us with the natural fact of overpopulation and adds to our troubles by our psychological incapacity to make the necessary political arrangements. It remains quite natural for men to quarrel and to struggle for superiority over one another. How then have we "conquered nature"? As any c h a n g e must begin somewhere, it is the single individual who will experience it and carry it through. T h e change must indeed begin with an individual; it might be any one of us. Nobody can afford to look around and to wait for s o m e b o d y else to do w h a t he is loath to do himself. But since nobody seems to know what to do, it might be worth while for each of us to ask himself whether by any chance his or her unconscious may know something that will help us. Certainly the conscious mind seems unable to do anything useful in this respect. M a n t o d a y is painfully a w a r e of the fact t h a t neither his great religions nor his various philosophies seem to provide him with those powerful a n i m a t i n g ideas that would give him the security he needs in face of the present condition of the world.

Christians often ask why God does not speak to t h e m , as he is believed to h a v e d o n e in former days. W h e n I hear such questions, it always makes me think of the rabbi who was asked how it could be that God often showed himself to people in the olden days whereas nowadays nobody ever sees him. T h e rabbi replied: " N o w a d a y s t h e r e is no longer a n y b o d y w h o can bow low enough." This answer hits the nail on the head. We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions. The Buddhist discards the world of unconscious fantasies as useless illusions; the Christian puts his Church and his Bible between himself and his unconscious; and the rational intellectual does not yet know that his consciousness is not his total psyche. T h i s i g n o r a n c e persists t o d a y in spite of the fact that for more t h a n 70 years the unconscious has been a basic scientific concept that is i n d i s p e n s a b l e to a n y serious psychological investigation.
We can no longer afford to be so GodAlmighty-like as to set ourselves up as judges of the merits or demerits of natural phenomena. We do not base our botany upon the oldfashioned division into useful and useless plants, or our zoology upon the naive distinction between harmless and dangerous animals. But we still c o m p l a c e n t l y assume t h a t consciousness is sense a n d the unconscious is nonsense. I n science such an a s s u m p t i o n w o u l d be l a u g h e d out of court. Do microbes, for instance, m a k e sense or nonsense?
W h a t e v e r the unconscious m a y be, it is a natural phenomenon producing symbols that prove to be meaningful. We cannot expect someone who has never looked through a microscope to be an authority on microbes; in the same way, no one who has not made a serious study of natural symbols can be considered a competent judge in this matter. But the general u n d e r v a l u a t i o n of the h u m a n soul is so g r e a t that neither the great religions nor the philosophies nor scientific rationalism have been willing to look at it twice.
In spite of the fact that the Catholic Church a d m i t s the o c c u r r e n c e of somma a Deo missa (dreams sent by God), most of its thinkers make no serious attempt to understand dreams. I d o u b t w h e t h e r t h e r e is a P r o t e s t a n t treatise or doctrine that would stoop so low as to admit the possibility t h a t the vox Dei m i g h t be perceived in a d r e a m . But if a theologian really believes in God, by what authority does he suggest that G o d is u n a b l e to speak t h r o u g h dreams?
I have spent more than half a century in investigating natural symbols, and I have come to the conclusion that dreams and their symbols are not stupid and meaningless. On the contrary, dreams provide the most interesting information for those who take the trouble to u n d e r s t a n d their symbols. T h e results, it is true, have little to do with such worldly concerns as b u y i n g a n d selling. But the m e a n i n g of life is not exhaustively e x p l a i n e d by one's business life, nor is the d e e p desire of the h u m a n h e a r t answered by a bank account.
In a period of h u m a n history when all available e n e r g y is spent in the investigation of n a t u r e , very little a t t e n t i o n is p a i d to the essence of m a n , which is his psyche, a l t h o u g h m a n y researches are made into its conscious functions. But the really complex and unfamiliar part of the mind, from which symbols are produced, is still virtually u n e x p l o r e d . It seems almost incredible that t h o u g h we receive signals from it every night, deciphering these communications seems too tedious for any but a very few people to be bothered with it. Man's greatest instrum e n t , his psyche, is little t h o u g h t of, a n d it is often directly mistrusted and despised. "It's only p s y c h o l o g i c a l " too often m e a n s : It is nothing.
Where, exactly, does this immense prejudice come from ? We have obviously been so busy with the question of what we think that we entirely forget to ask what the unconscious psyche thinks a b o u t us. T h e ideas of S i g m u n d Freud confirmed for most people the existing c o n t e m p t for the psyche. Before him it had been merely overlooked and neglected; it has now become a d u m p for moral refuse.

This m o d e r n s t a n d p o i n t is surely one-sided and unjust. It does not even accord with the known facts. O u r actual knowledge of the unconscious shows t h a t it is a n a t u r a l p h e n o m e n o n and that, like N a t u r e herself, it is at least neutral. It c o n t a i n s all aspects of h u m a n n a t u r e light and dark, beautiful and ugly, good and evil, profound and silly. T h e study of individual, as well as of collective, symbolism is a n e n o r mous task, and one that has not yet been mastered. But a beginning has been made at last. The early results are encouraging, and they seem to indicate an answer to m a n y so far unanswered questions of present-day mankind.

Ancient myths and modern man
The eternal symbols
T h e a n c i e n t history of m a n is b e i n g m e a n i n g fully rediscovered today in the symbolic images and myths that have survived ancient man. As archaeologists dig d e e p into the past, it is less the events of historical time that we learn to treasure than the statues, designs, temples, and languages that tell of old beliefs. Other symbols are revealed to us by the philologists and religious historians, who can translate these beliefs into intelligible modern concepts. These in turn are brought to life by the c u l t u r a l a n t h r o p o l o gists. They can show that the same symbolic patterns can be found in the rituals or myths of small tribal societies still existing, unchanged for centuries, on the outskirts of civilization.
All such researches have done much to correct the one-sided a t t i t u d e ol those m o d e r n men who maintain that such symbols belong to the peoples of antiquity or to "backward"" modern tribes and are therefore irrelevant to the complexities of modern life. In London or New York we may dismiss the fertility rites of neolithic man as archaic superstition. If anyone claims to have seen a vision or heard voices, he
is not t r e a t e d as a saint or as a n oracle. It is said he is m e n t a l l y d i s t u r b e d . W e read the myths of the ancient Greeks or the folk stories of American Indians, but we fail to see any connection between them and our attitudes to the " h e r o e s " or d r a m a t i c events of t o d a y . Yet the connections are there. And the symbols that represent them have not lost their relevance for mankind. O n e of the m a i n c o n t r i b u t i o n s of" o u r time to the u n d e r s t a n d i n g a n d r e v a l u i n g of such eternal symbols has been made by Dr. Jung's School of Analytical Psychology. It has helped to break down the arbitrary distinction between primitive man. to whom symbols seem a natural part of everyday life, and m o d e r n m a n , for whom symbols are apparently meaningless and irrelevant. As Dr. J u n g has pointed out earlier in this book, the h u m a n mind has its own history and the psyche retains traces left from previous stages of its development. More than this, the c o n t e n t s of the unconscious exert a formative influence on the psyche. Consciously we



may ignore- them, hut unconsciously we respond to them, and to the symbolic forms including dreams—in which they express themselves. The individual m a y feel that his d r e a m s a r e spontaneous and disconnected. But over a long period of time the a n a l y s t c a n observe a series of d r e a m i m a g e s a n d n o t e t h a t they h a v e a meaningful pattern; and by understanding this his patient m a y eventually a c q u i r e a new attitude to life. Some of the symbols in such dreams derive from what Dr. J u n g has called "the collective unconscious" that is, the part of the psyche t h a t retains a n d t r a n s m i t s the common psychological i n h e r i t a n c e of m a n k i n d . These symbols are so ancient and unfamiliar to modern man that he cannot directly understand or assimilate them.
It is here t h a t t h e analyst c a n h e l p . Possibly the patient must be freed from the encumbrance of symbols that h a v e g r o w n stale a n d i n a p p r o priate. Or possibly he must be assisted to discover the abiding value of an old symbol that, far from being d e a d , is seeking to be r e b o r n in modern form. Before the analyst can effectively explore the meaning of symbols with a p a t i e n t , he must himself a c q u i r e a w i d e r k n o w l e d g e of their origins and significance. For the analogies between ancient myths and the stories that appear
in the dreams of modern patients are neither trivial nor accidental. They exist because the unconscious mind of modern man preserves the symbol-making capacity that once found expression in the beliefs a n d rituals of the p r i m i tive. A n d t h a t c a p a c i t y still plays a role of vital psychic importance. In more ways than we realize, we are dependent on the messages that are carried by such symbols, and both our attitudes and our behavior are profoundly influenced by them. In w a r t i m e , for instance, one finds increased interest in the works of H o m e r , S h a k e s p e a r e , a n d Tolstoi, and we read with a new understanding those passages that give war its enduring (or "archetypal") meaning. They evoke a response from us t h a t is m u c h m o r e profound t h a n it could be from someone who has never known the intense emotional experience of war. T h e battles on the plains of T r o y w e r e utterly unlike the fighting at Agincourt or Borodino, yet the great writers are able to transcend the differences of time and place and to express themes that are universal. We respond because these themes are fundamentally symbolic.
A more striking example should be familiar to anyone who has grown up in a Christian society. At Christmas we may express our inner feeling for the m y t h o l o g i c a l b i r t h of a semi

divine child, even though we may not believe in the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ or have any kind of conscious religious faith. Unknowingly, we have fallen in with the symbolism of rebirth. T h i s is a relic of an immensely older solstice festival, which carries the hope that the fading winter landscape of the northern hemisphere will be renewed. For all our sophistication we find satisfaction in this symbolic festival, just as we join with our children at Easter in the pleasant ritual of Easter eggs and Easter rabbits.
But do we understand what we do, or see the connection between the story of Christ's birth, death, a n d resurrection a n d the folk symbolism of Easter? Usually we do not even care to consider such things intellectually. Yet they complement each other. Christ's crucifixion on G o o d F r i d a y seems at first sight to belong to the same pattern of fertility symbolism t h a t o n e finds in the rituals of such o t h e r "saviors" as Osiris, T a m m u z , and Orpheus. They, too, were of divine or semi-divine birth, they flourished, were killed, and were reborn. They belonged, in fact, to cyclic religions in which the death and rebirth of the god-king was an eternally recurring myth.
But the resurrection of Christ on Easter Sund a y is m u c h less satisfying from a ritual point of view t h a n is the symbolism of the cyclic religions. For Christ ascends to sit at the right hand of God the Father: His resurrection occurs once and for all. It is this finality of the C h r i s t i a n c o n c e p t of the resurrection (the Christian idea of the Last Judgment has a similar "closed" theme) that distinguishes Christianity from other god-king myths. It happened once, and the ritual merely c o m m e m o r a t e s it. But this sense of finality is probably one reason why early Christians, still influenced by pre-Christian traditions, felt that Christianity needed to be supplemented by some elements of an older fertility ritual. They needed the recurring promise of rebirth; and t h a t is w h a t is symbolized by t h e egg a n d the rabbit of Easter. I have taken two quite different examples to show how modern man continues to respond to profound psychic influences of a kind that, consciously, he dismisses as little more than the folk tales of superstitious and uneducated peoples. But it is necessary to go m u c h further than this. The more closely one looks at the history of symbolism, and at the role that sym

bols have played in the life of m a n y different cultures, the more one understands that there is also a re-creative m e a n i n g in these symbols. Some symbols relate to childhood and the transition to adolescence, others to maturity, and others again to the experience of old age, w h e n m a n is p r e p a r i n g for his i n e v i t a b l e d e a t h . Dr. J u n g has described how the dreams of a girl of eight contained the symbols one normally associates with old age. Her dreams presented aspects of initiation into life as belonging to the same archetypal pattern as initiation into death. This progression of symbolic ideas may take place, therefore, within the unconscious mind of modern man just as it took place in the rituals of ancient societies. This crucial link between archaic or primitive myths and the symbols produced by the unconscious is of i m m e n s e p r a c t i c a l i m p o r t a n c e to the analyst. It enables him to identify and to interpret these symbols in a context that gives them historical perspective as well as psychological meaning. I shall now take some of the more important myths of antiquity and show how — and to what purpose — they are analogous to the symbolic material that we encounter in our dreams.
Top left, Christ's nativity; center, his crucifixion; bottom, his ascension. His birth, death, and rebirth follows the pattern of many ancient hero m y t h s — a pattern originally based on seasonal fertility rites like those probably held 3 0 0 0 years ago at England's Stonehenge (seen below at d a w n at the summer solstice).



Heroes and hero makers
T h e m y t h of the h e r o is the most c o m m o n a n d the best-known myth in the world. We find it in the classical mythology of Greece and R o m e , in the Middle Ages, in the Far East, and a m o n g contemporary primitive tribes. It also appears in our dreams. It has an obvious dramatic appeal, and a less obvious, but nonetheless profound, psychological importance. These hero myths vary enormously in detail, but the more closely one examines them the more one sees that structurally they are very similar. They h a v e , t h a t is to say, a universal pattern, even though they were developed by groups or individuals without any direct cultural contact with each other—by, for instance, tribes of Africans or North American Indians, or the G r e e k s , or the I n c a s of P e r u . O v e r a n d over again one hears a tale describing a hero's m i r a c u l o u s b u t h u m b l e b i r t h , his early proof of superhuman strength, his rapid rise to prominence or power, his triumphant struggle with
the forces of evil, his fallibility to the sin of p r i d e (kybris), a n d his fall t h r o u g h b e t r a y a l or a "heroic" sacrifice that ends in his death. I shall later explain in more detail why I believe that this pattern has psychological meaning both for the individual, w h o is endeavoring to discover a n d assert his personality, and for a whole society, which has an equal need to establish its collective identity. But another important characteristic of the hero myth provides a clue. In many of these stories the early weakness of the h e r o is b a l a n c e d by the a p p e a r a n c e of strong " t u t e l a r y " figures or guardians who enable him to perform the superhuman tasks that he cannot accomplish unaided. Among the Greek heroes, Theseus had Poseidon, god of the sea, as his deity; Perseus had Athena; Achilles had Cheiron, the wise centaur, as his tutor.

and more comprehensive identity that supplies the strength that the personal ego lacks. Their special role suggests that the essential function of the heroic m y t h is the d e v e l o p m e n t of the individual's ego-consciousness — his awareness of his o w n s t r e n g t h s a n d weaknesses—in a m a n ner that will equip him for the arduous tasks with which life confronts him. O n c e the individual has passed his initial test and can enter the m a t u r e phase of life, the hero myth loses its relevance. The hero's symbolic death becomes, as it were, the achievement of that maturity.
I have so far been referring to the complete hero myth, in which the whole cycle from birth to d e a t h is e l a b o r a t e l y described. But it is essential to recognize that at each of the stages in this cycle there are special forms of the hero story that apply to the particular point reached by the individual in the development of his egoconsciousness, and to the specific problem confronting him at a given m o m e n t . T h a t is to say, the image of the hero evolves in a manner that reflects each stage of the evolution of the human personality.
This concept can be more easily understood if I present it in w h a t a m o u n t s to a d i a g r a m . I take this example from the obscure North American tribe of Winnebago Indians, because it sets out quite clearly four distinct stages in the evolution of the hero. In these stories (which Dr. Paul Radin published in 1948 under the
title Hero Cycles of the Winnebago) w e c a n see the definite progression from the most primitive to the most sophisticated concept of the hero. This progression is c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of o t h e r hero cycles. T h o u g h t h e symbolic figures in t h e m naturally have different names, their roles are similar, and we shall understand them better once we have grasped the point made by this example. Dr. Radin noted four distinct cycles in the evolution of the hero myth. He named them the Trickster cycle, the Hare cycle, the Red Horn cycle, a n d t h e Twin cycle. H e correctly perceived the psychology of this evolution when he said: "It represents our efforts to deal with the problem of growing up, aided by the illusion of a n e t e r n a l fiction." The Trickster cycle corresponds to the earliest a n d least d e v e l o p e d period of life. T r i c k s t e r is a figure whose physical a p p e t i t e s d o m i n a t e his b e h a v i o r ; he has the m e n t a l i t y of a n infant. Lacking any purpose beyond the gratification of his p r i m a r y needs, he is cruel, cynical, a n d unfeeling. (Our stories of Brer Rabbit or Reynard the Fox preserve the essentials of the T r i c k s t e r m y t h . ) T h i s figure, w h i c h at the outset assumes the form of an animal, passes from o n e mischievous exploit to a n o t h e r . But, as hedoes so, a change comes over him. At the end of his r o g u e ' s progress he is b e g i n n i n g to take on the physical likeness of a grown man.
I I2



T h e next figure is H a r e . H e also, like Trickster (whose animal traits are represented among some American Indians by a coyote), first a p p e a r s in a n i m a l form. H e has not yet attained mature h u m a n stature, but all the same he appears as the founder of h u m a n culture—the Transformer. The Winnebago believe that, in giving them their famous Medicine Rite, he became their savior as well as their culture-hero. This myth was so powerful, Dr. Radin tells us, that the members of the Peyote Rite were reluctant to give up Hare when Christianity began to penetrate the tribe. He became merged with the figure of Christ, and some of them argued that they had no need of Christ since they already had Hare. This archetypal figure r e p r e s e n t s a distinct a d v a n c e on Trickster: O n e can see that he is b e c o m i n g a socialized being, correcting the instinctual and infantile urges found in the Trickster cycle.
Red Horn, the third of this series of hero figures, is a n a m b i g u o u s p e r s o n , said to be t h e youngest of 10 b r o t h e r s . H e meets the r e q u i r e ments of an archetypal hero by passing such tests as winning a race a n d by proving himself in battle. His s u p e r h u m a n p o w e r is s h o w n by his ability to defeat giants by guile (in a g a m e of dice) or by s t r e n g t h (in a wrestling m a t c h ) . He has a powerful companion in the form of a thunderbird called "Storms-as-he-walks," whose strength compensates for whatever weakness
Red Horn may display. With Red Horn we have reached the world of man, though an archaic world, in which the aid of superhuman powers or tutelary gods is needed to ensure man's victory over the evil forces that beset him. Toward the end of the story the hero-god departs, leaving Red Horn and his sons on earth. The danger to man's happiness and security now comes from man himself. T h i s basic t h e m e (which is r e p e a t e d in the last cycle, that of the Twins) raises, in effect, the vital question: How long can human beings, be successful without falling victims to their own pride or, in mythological terms, to the jealousy of the gods? Though the Twins are said to be the sons of the Sun, they are essentially human and together constitute a single person. Originally united in the mother's w o m b , they were forced apart at birth. Yet they belong together, and it is necessary — t h o u g h exceedingly difficultto reunite them. In these two children we see the two sides of man's nature. O n e of them. Flesh, is a c q u i e s c e n t , mild, a n d w i t h o u t initiative; the other, S t u m p , is d y n a m i c a n d rebellious. In some of the stories of the Twin Heroes these attitudes arc refined to the point where o n e figure r e p r e s e n t s the i n t r o v e r t , whose m a i n strength lies in his powers of reflection, and the o t h e r is an e x t r a v e r t , a m a n of action w h o c a n accomplish great deeds.

For a long time these two heroes are invincible: Whether they are presented as two sepa r a t e figures or as t w o - i n - o n e , they c a r r y all before them. Yet, like the warrior gods of Navaho Indian mythology, they eventually sicken from the abuse of their own power. There are no monsters left in heaven or on earth for them to overcome, and their consequent wild behavior brings retribution in its train. T h e Winnebago say that nothing, in the end, was safe from them — not even the supports on which the world rests. When the Twins killed one of the four animals that upheld the earth, they had overstepped all limits, and the time had come to put a stop to their career. The punishment they deserved was death.
Thus, in both the Red Horn cycle and that of the Twins, we see the theme of sacrifice or d e a t h of the h e r o as a necessary c u r e for hybris, the pride that has over-reached itself. In the primitive societies whose levels of culture correspond to the Red Horn cycle, it appears that this danger may have been forestalled by the institution of propitiatory h u m a n sacrifice — a theme that has immense symbolic importance and recurs continually in h u m a n history. T h e W i n n e b a g o , like the Iroquois and a few Algonquin tribes, probably ate h u m a n flesh as a totemic ritual that could tame their individualistic and destructive impulses.
In the examples of the hero's betrayal or defeat that occur in European mythology, the t h e m e of ritual sacrifice is m o r e specifically e m ployed as a p u n i s h m e n t for hybris. But the Winnebago, like the Navaho, do not go so far. Though the Twins erred, and though the punishment should have been death, they themselves became so frightened by their irresponsible power that they consented to live in a state of permanent rest: T h e conflicting sides of h u m a n nature were again in equilibrium. I have given this description of the four types of hero at some, length because it provides a clear demonstration of the pattern that occurs both in the historic myths and in the hero d r e a m s of c o n t e m p o r a r y man. With this in mind we can e x a m i n e the following d r e a m of a middle-aged patient. The interpretation of this dream shows how the analytical psychologist can, from his knowledge of mythology, help his p a t i e n t find a n a n s w e r to w h a t m i g h t otherwise seem a n insoluble riddle. This m a n d r e a m e d hewas at a theatre, in the role of " a n important s p e c t a t o r whose o p i n i o n is r e s p e c t e d . " Therewas an act in which a white monkey was standing on a pedestal with men around him. In recounting his dream the man said :
My guide explains the theme to me.' It is the ordeal of a voting sailor who is exposed both to
The second stage in the evolution of the hero is the f o u n d e r of h u m a n culture. Left, a Navaho sand painting of the myth of Coyote, w h o stole fire from the g o d s a n d gave it to man. In Greek myth Prometheus also stole fire from the gods for man for which he was chained to a rock and tortured by an eagle (below, o n a s i x t h - c e n t u r y B.c c u p ) .



The hero in the third stage is a powerful m a n - g o d — like Buddha. In the first-century sculpture above, Siddhartha begins the journey on which he will receive enlightenment and become Buddha.

the wind and to being beaten up. I begin to object that this white monkey is not a sailor at all; but just at that moment a young man in black stands up and I think that he must be the true hero. But another handsome young man strides toward an altar and stretches himself out on it. They are making marks on his bare chest as a preparation to offering him as a human sacrifice. Then I find myself on a platform with several other people. We could get down by a small ladder, but I hesitate to do so because there are two young toughs standing by and I think that they will stop us. But when a woman in the group uses the ladder unmolested, I see that it is safe and all of us follow the woman down.
Now a dream of this kind cannot be quickly or simply interpreted. We have to unravel it carefully in order to show both its relation to the d r e a m e r ' s own life a n d its wider symbolic implications. T h e patient who produced it was a man who had achieved maturity in a physical sense. He was successful in his career, and he had apparently done pretty well as a husband and father. Yet psychologically he was still immature, and had not completed his youthful phase of development. It was this psychic immaturity that expressed itselfin his dreams as different aspects of the hero myth. These images still exerted a strong attraction for his imagination even though they had long since exhausted any
of their meaning in terms of the reality of his everyday life. T h u s , in a d r e a m , we see a series of figures theatrically presented as various aspects of a figure t h a t the d r e a m e r keeps e x p e c t i n g will t u r n o u t to be the t r u e h e r o . T h e first is a white monkey, the second a sailor, the third a young man in black, and the last a "handsome young m a n . " In the early part of the performance, which is supposed to represent the sailor's ordeal, the dreamer sees only the white monkey. T h e man in black suddenly appears and as s u d d e n l y d i s a p p e a r s ; he is a n e w figure w h o first c o n t r a s t s with the w h i t e m o n k e y a n d is then for a m o m e n t confused with the hero proper. (Such confusion in d r e a m s is not u n u s u a l . T h e d r e a m e r is not usually p r e s e n t e d with clear images by the unconscious. He has to puzzle out a meaning from a succession of contrasts and paradoxes.)
Significantly, these figures appear in the course of a theatrical performance, and this context seems to be a direct reference by the dreamer to his own treatment by analysis: The " g u i d e " he m e n t i o n s is p r e s u m a b l y his analyst. Yet h e does not see himself as a p a t i e n t w h o is being treated by a doctor but as " a n important s p e c t a t o r whose o p i n i o n is r e s p e c t e d . " T h i s is the vantage point from which he sees certain figures w h o m he associates w i t h the e x p e r i e n c e
An individual psyche develops (as does the hero myth) from a primitive, childish stage—and often images of the early stages can appear in the dreams of psychologically immature adults. The first stage might be represented by the carefree play of children — like the pillow fight (far left) from the 1933 French film Zero de Conduite. T h e s e c o n d stage might be the reckless thrillseeking of early adolescence: Right, American youths test their nerves in a speeding car. A later stage can produce idealism, and selfsacrifice in late adolescence, exemplified in the picture (opposite, far right) taken d u r i n g the East Berlin rising (June 1953) when young men fought Russian tanks with stones.

of growing up. T h e white m o n k e y , for instance, reminds him of the playful and somewhat lawless behavior of boys b e t w e e n t h e ' a g e s of seven and 12. T h e sailor suggests the adventurousness of early a d o l e s c e n c e , t o g e t h e r with t h e consequent punishment by " b e a t i n g " for irresponsible pranks. T h e d r e a m e r could offer no association to the young man in black, but in the handsome young man about to be sacrificed he saw a reminder of the self-sacrificing idealism of late adolescence.
At this stage it is possible to put together the historical material (or archetypal hero images) and the data from the dreamer's personal experience in order to see how they corroborate, contradict, or qualify each other. T h e first conclusion is t h a t the w h i t e m o n k e y seems to represent Trickster or at least those traits of personality that the W i n n e b a g o attribute to Trickster. But, to me, the monkey also stands for s o m e t h i n g that the d r e a m e r has not personally and adequately experienced for himself— he in fact says t h a t in the d r e a m he was a spectator. I found out that as a boy he had been excessively attached to his parents, and that he was naturally introspective. For these reasons he had never fully developed the boisterous qualities natural to late childhood; nor had he joined in the games of his schoolfellows. He had not, as the saying goes, "got up to mon
key tricks" or practiced "monkeyshines." The saying provides the clue here. T h e monkey in the d r e a m is in fact a symbolic form of the Trickster figure. But why should Trickster appear as a monkey? And why should it be white? As I have already pointed out, the Winnebago myth tells us that, toward the end of the cycle, Trickster begins to emerge in the physical likeness of a m a n . A n d h e r e , in the d r e a m , is a m o n k e y so close to a h u m a n being that it is a l a u g h a b l e and not too dangerous caricature of a man. T h e dreamer himself could offer no personal association that could explain why the monkey was white. But from our knowledge of primitive symbolism we can conjecture that whiteness lends a special quality of "god-likeness" to this o t h e r w i s e b a n a l figure. ( T h e a l b i n o is regarded as sacred in many primitive communities.) T h i s fits in q u i t e well w i t h T r i c k s t e r ' s semi-divine or semi-magical powers.
T h u s , it seems, the white monkey symbolizes for the d r e a m e r the positive quality of childhood playfulness, which he had insufficiently accepted at the time, a n d which he now feels called upon to exalt. As the dream tells us, he places it "on a pedestal," where it becomes something more than a lost childhood experience. It is, for the adult m a n , a symbol of creative experimentalism.
i '7



Next we come to the conclusion about the m o n k e y . Is it a m o n k e y , or is it a sailor w h o has to put up with beatings? The dreamer's own associations pointed to the meaning of this transformation. But in any case the next stage in h u m a n d e v e l o p m e n t is o n e in which the irresponsibility of childhood gives way to a period of socialization, and that involves submission to painful discipline. One could say, therefore, that the sailor is an a d v a n c e d form of Trickster, w h o is b e i n g c h a n g e d into a socially responsibleperson by means of an initiation ordeal. Drawing on the history of symbolism, we can assumethat the wind represents the natural elements in this process, and the beatings are those that are humanly induced.
At this point, then, we have a reference to the process that the Winnebago describe in the H a r e cycle, w h e r e the culture-hero is a weak yet struggling figure, r e a d y to sacrifice childishness for the sake of further development. O n c e a g a i n , in this p h a s e of the d r e a m , the p a t i e n t is acknowledging his failure to experience to the full an i m p o r t a n t aspect of c h i l d h o o d a n d early adolescence. He missed out on the playfulness of the child, and also on the rather more ad
vanced pranks of the young teenager, and he is seeking ways in which those lost experiences and personal qualities can be rehabilitated. Next comes a curious change in the dream. T h e young m a n in black appears, and for a m o m e n t the d r e a m e r feels that this is the " t r u e h e r o . " T h a t is all we are told a b o u t the m a n in black; yet this fleeting glimpse introduces a theme of profound importance —a theme that occurs frequently in dreams. This is the concept of the " s h a d o w , " which plays such a vital role in analytical psychology. Dr. J u n g has pointed out that the shadow cast by the conscious mind of the individual contains the hidden, repressed, and unfavorable (or nefarious) aspects of the personality. But this darkness is not jusl the simple ((inverse of the conscious ego. Just as the ego contains unfavorable and destructive attitudes, so the shadow has good qualities— normal instincts and creative impulses. Ego and shadow, indeed, although separate, are inextricably linked together in much the same way that thought and feeling are related to each other.
T h e ego, nevertheless, is in conflict with the shadow, in what Dr. J u n g once called "the b a t t l e for d e l i v e r a n c e . " In the struggle of primitive man to achieve consciousness, this conflict is expressed by the contest b e t w e e n the archetypal hero and the cosmic powers of evil, personified by dragons and other monsters. In the developing consciousness of the individual the hero figure is the symbolic means by which t h e e m e r g i n g ego o v e r c o m e s the inertia of the unconscious mind, and liberates the mature
The young, undifferentiated egop e r s o n a l i t y is p r o t e c t e d by t h e m o t h e r — a protection imaged by the sheltering Madonna, left (in a painting by the 1 5th-century Italian artist Piero della Francesca), or by the Egyptian sky goddess Nut, right, bending over the earth (in a f i f t h - c e n t u r y B.C. r e l i e f ) . B u t t h e ego must eventually free itself from unconsciousness and immaturity; and its "battle for d e l i v e r a n c e " is often symbolized by a hero's battle with a monster—like the Japanese god Susanoo's battle with a serpent, top right (in a 19th-century print). The hero doesn't always w i n at once: For instance, Jonah was swallowed by the whale (far right, from a 14th-century manuscript).

man from a regressive longing to return to the blissful state of infancy in a world d o m i n a t e d by his mother. Usually, in mythology, the hero wins his battle against the monster. (I shall say more about this in a moment.) But there are other hero myths in which the hero gives in to the m o n s t e r . A familiar type is t h a t of J o n a h a n d the w h a l e , in w h i c h the h e r o is swallowed by a sea monster that carries him on a night sea journey from west to east, thus symbolizing the supposed transit of the sun from sunset to dawn. The hero goes into darkness, which represents a kind of death. I have encountered this theme in dreams presented in my own clinical experience. The battle between the hero and the dragon is the m o r e active form of this m y t h , a n d it shows more clearly the archetypal theme of the ego's triumph over regressive trends. For most people the dark or negative side of the personality remains unconscious. The hero, on the contrary, must realize that the shadow exists
The ego's emergence can be symbolized not by a battle but by a sacrifice: death leading to rebirth. R e v o l u t i o n is sacrificial in this w a y : D e l a c r o i x ' s p a i n t i n g ( b e l o w ) , Greece expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi, personifies the country killed by civil war to be liberated and reborn. As individual sacrifices: the British poet Byron (above) died in Greece during the revolution (1824). Below left, the Christian martyr St. Lucia sacrificed her eyes and her life for her religion.



and that he can draw strength from it. He must come to terms with its destructive powers if he is to b e c o m e s u f f i c i e n t l y t e r r i b l e to o v e r c o m e the dragon i.e. before the ego can t r i u m p h , it must master and assimilate the shadow.
O n e c a n see this t h e m e , incidentally, in a well-known literary hero figure (Joe t he's character of Faust. In accepting the wager of Mephistopheles. Faust put himself in the power of a "shadow"' figure that Goethe describes as '"part of that power which, willing evil, finds the good."' Like the man whose dream I have been discussing, Faust had failed to live out to the full a n i m p o r t a n t p a r t o f his e a r l y life. Hewas, accordingly, an unreal or incomplete person who lost himself in a fruitless quest for metaphysical goals that failed to materialize. He was still unwilling to accept life's challenge to live both the good and the b a d .
It is to this aspect o f the u n c o n s c i o u s that the young man in black in my patient's d r e a m seems to refer. Such a reminder of the shadow side o f his p e r s o n a l i t y , of its powerful p o t e n t i a l
and its role in preparing the hero for the struggles o f life, is a n essential t r a n s i t i o n from the earlier parts of the dream to the theme of the sacrificial hero: the handsome young man who places himself on an altar. I his figure represents the form o f heroism that is c o m m o n l y associated to the ego-building process of late adolescence. A man expresses the ideal principles of his life at this time, sensing their power both to transform himself and to change his relations with others. He is, so to speak, in the b l o o m of y o u t h , a t t r a c t i v e , full o f e n e r g y a n d idealism. Why. then, does he willingly offer himself as a human sacrifice?
T h e reason, p r e s u m a b l y , is the s a m e as that w h i c h m a d e the Twins of the W i n n e b a g o m y t h give up their power on pain of destruction. T h e i d e a l i s m o f y o u t h , w h i c h drives o n e so h a r d , is bound to lead to over-confidence: T h e human ego can be exalted to experience godlike attributes, but only at the cost of over-reaching itself a n d falling to disaster.

Below, a montage of World War I a call-to-arms poster, infantry, a military cemetery.

An inscription on one British memorial to the dead of World W a r I reads: " A t the g o i n g down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them."
In m y t h o l o g y , a hero's death is o f t e n d u e to his o w n hybris, w h i c h causes the gods to humble him. As a modern example: In 1 912 the s h i p Titanic s t r u c k an i c e b e r g a n d sank. (Right, a montage of scenes of the sinking, from the 1943 film Titanic.) Yet t h e Titanic h a d b e e n called "unsinkable": according to the American author Walter Lord, one sailor was heard to say, " G o d himself couldn't sink this ship!"



up to heaven on his fragile, humanly contrived wings, but who flies too close to the sun and plunges to his doom.) All the same, the youthful ego must always run this risk, for if a young man does not strive for a higher goal than he can safely reach, he cannot surmount the obstacles between adolescence and maturity. So far, I have been talking about the conclusions that, at the level of his personal associations, my patient could draw from his own d r e a m . Y e t t h e r e is a n a r c h e t y p a l level o f the dream — the mystery of the proffered human sacrifice. It is precisely b e c a u s e it is a mystery that it is expressed in a ritual a c t t h a t , in its symbolism, carries us a long way back into
man's history. Here, as the man lies stretched out on an altar, we see a reference to an act even more primitive than those performed on the altar stone in the temple at Stonehenge. T h e r e , as on so many primitive altars, we can imagine a yearly solstice rite combined with the death and rebirth of a mythological hero.
T h e ritual has a sorrow a b o u t it that is also a kind of joy, an inward acknowledgment that d e a t h also leads to a n e w life. W h e t h e r it is expressed in the prose epic of the W i n n e b a g o Indians, in a lament for the death of Balder in the Norse eddas, in Walt Whitman's poems of mourning for A b r a h a m Lincoln, or in the dream ritual whereby a man returns to his

Heroes often fight monsters to rescue "damsels In distress" ( w h o symbolize the anima). Left, St, George slays a dragon to free a maiden (in a 15th-century Italian painting). Right, in the 1 916 film The Great Secret, t h e d r a g o n has
become a locomotive but the heroic rescue remains the same.
youthful hopes a n d fears, it is the s a m e t h e m e — the drama of new birth through death. The end of the dream brings out a curious epilogue in which the dreamer at last becomes involved in the action of the dream. He and others are on a platform from which they have to descend. H e does not trust the l a d d e r because of the possible interference of hoodlums, but a woman encourages him to believe he can go down safely and this is a c c o m p l i s h e d . S i n c e I found out from his associations that the whole performance he witnessed was part of his analysis —a process of inner change that he was experiencing — he was presumably thinking of the difficulty of getting back to everyday reality again. His fear of the " t o u g h s , " as he calls them, suggests his fear that the Trickster archetype may appear in a collective form.
T h e saving elements in the dream are the m a n - m a d e l a d d e r , which here is p r o b a b l y a symbol of the rational mind, and the presence of the woman who encourages the dreamer to use it. H e r a p p e a r a n c e in the final s e q u e n c e of the dream points to a psychic need to include a feminine principle as a complement to all this excessively masculine activity.
It should not be assumed from what I have said, or from the fact that I have chosen to use the Winnebago myth to illuminate this particular dream, that one must seek for complete and wholly mechanical parallels between a dream and the materials one can find in the history of m y t h o l o g y . E a c h d r e a m is i n d i v i d u a l to the d r e a m e r , a n d the precise form it takes is d e t e r mined by his own situation. W h a t I have sought to show is the m a n n e r in which the unconscious draws on this archetypal material and modifies its patterns to the dreamer's needs. Thus, in this particular d r e a m , one must not look for a direct reference to what the Winnebago describe in the R e d Horn or T w i n cycles; the reference is r a t h e r to the essence o f those two themes—to the sacrificial element in them.
As a general rule it can be said that the need for hero symbols arises when the ego needs s t r e n g t h e n i n g w h e n , that is to say, the c o n scious mind needs assistance in some task that it c a n n o t accomplish unaided or without drawing on the sources of strength that lie in the unconscious mind. In the dream I have been discussing, for instance, there was no reference to one of the more important aspects of the myth of the typical hero —his capacity to save or protect beautiful women from terrible danger. ( T h e d a m s e l in distress was a f a v o r i t e m y t h of m e d i e v a l E u r o p e . ) T h i s is o n e way in w h i c h myths or dreams refer to the " a n i m a " — the feminine e l e m e n t of the m a l e psyche that Goethe called "the Eternal Feminine."
T h e nature and function of this female element will be discussed later in this book by Dr. von Franz. But its relation to the hero figure can be illustrated here by a dream produced by another patient, also a man of mature years. He began by saying:
" I had returned from a long hike through India. A woman had equipped myself and a friend for the journey, and on my return I r e p r o a c h e d her for failing to give us black rainhats, telling her that through this oversight we had been soaked by the rain."
T h i s introduction to the d r e a m , it later emerged, referred to a period in this man's youth when he was given to taking " h e r o i c " walks through dangerous mountain country in company with a college friend. (As he had
123



never been to India, and in view of his own associations to this dream, I concluded that the dream journey signified his exploration of a new region — n o t , t h a t is to say, a real p l a c e but the realm of the unconscious.)
In his dream the patient seems to feel that a w o m a n — presumably a personification of his anima —has failed to prepare him properly for this expedition. T h e lack of a suitable rainhat suggests that he feels in an unprotected state of m i n d , in w h i c h he is u n c o m f o r t a b l y affected by exposure to new and not altogether pleasant experiences. He believes that the woman should have provided a rainhat for him, just as his mother provided clothes for him to wear as a b o y . T h i s episode is r e m i n i s c e n t o f his early picaresque wanderings, when he was sustained by the assumption that his mother (the original feminine image) would protect him against all dangers. As he grew older, he saw that this was a childish illusion, and he now blames his misfortune on his own anima, not his mother.
In the next stage of the dream the patient speaks o f p a r t i c i p a t i n g in a hike with a g r o u p of people. He grows tired and returns to an outdoor restaurant where he finds his raincoat, together with the rainhat that he had missed earlier. He sits down to rest; and, as he does so, he notices a poster stating that a local highschool boy is taking the part o f Perseus in a play. T h e n the boy in question appears — who turns out to be not a boy at all but a husky
y o u n g m a n . H e is dressed in g r a y with a black hat. and he sits down to talk with another young man dressed in a black suit. Immediately after this scene the dreamer feels a new vigor, a n d finds that he is c a p a b l e o f r e j o i n i n g his party. T h e y all then climb over the next hill. T h e r e , b e l o w t h e m , he sees their d e s t i n a t i o n ; it is a lovely h a r b o r town. H e feels both h e a r t e n e d and rejuvenated by the discovery.
Here, in contrast to the restless, uncomfortable, and lonely journey of the first episode, the d r e a m e r is with a g r o u p . T h e c o n t r a s t marks a change from an earlier pattern of isolation and youthful protest to the socializing influence of a relation to others. Since this implies a new capacity for relatedness, it suggests that his anima must now be functioning better t h a n it was before — s y m b o l i z e d by his discovery of the missing hat that the anima figure had previously failed to provide for him.
But the d r e a m e r is tired, and the scene at the restaurant reflects his need to look at his earlier attitudes in a new light, with the hope of renewing his strength by this regression. And so it t u r n s o u t . W h a t he first sees is a poster suggesting the enactment of a youthful hero role a high-school boy playing the part of Perseus. T h e n he sees the boy, now a man, with a friend who makes a sharp contrast to him. T h e o n e dressed in light g r a y , the o t h e r in black, can be recognized, from what I have previously said, as a version of the Twins. They



are hero-figures expressing the opposites of ego and alter-ego, which, however, appear here in a harmonious and unified relation.
The patient's associations confirmed this and emphasized that the figure in gray represents a well-adapted, worldly attitude to life, whereas the figure in b l a c k r e p r e s e n t s t h e s p i r i t u a l life, in the sense t h a t a c l e r g y m a n w e a r s b l a c k . T h a t they wore hats (and he now had found his own) points to their having achieved a relatively mature identity of a kind that he had felt to be severely lacking in his own earlier adolescent years, when the quality of " T r i c k s t e r i s m " still clung to him, in spite of his idealistic self-image as a seeker o f w i s d o m .
His association to the Greek hero Perseus was a curious o n e , which proved especially significant because it revealed a glaring inaccuracy. It turned out that he thought Perseus was the hero who slew the M i n o t a u r and rescued Ariadne from the Cretan labyrinth. As he wrote the name down for me, he discovered his mistake—that it was Theseus, not Perseus, who slew the M i n o t a u r — a n d this mistake b e c a m e suddenly meaningful, as such slips often do, by making him notice what these two heroes had in c o m m o n . T h e y both had to o v e r c o m e their fear of unconscious demonic maternal powers and had to liberate from these powers a single youthful f e m i n i n e figure.
Perseus had to cut off the head of the gorgon Medusa, whose horrifying visage and snaky
locks turned all who gazed upon them to stone. He later had to overcome the dragon that guarded Andromeda. Theseus represented the young patriarchal spirit of Athens who had to brave the terrors of the Cretan labyrinth with its monstrous inmate, the M i n o t a u r , which perhaps symbolized the unhealthy decadence of matriarchal Crete. (In all cultures, the labyrinth has the meaning of an entangling and confusing representation of the world oi matriarchal consciousness; it can be traversed only by those who are ready for a special initiation into the mysterious world of the collective unconscious.) Having overcome this danger, Theseus rescued Ariadne, a maiden in distress.
This rescue symbolizes the liberation of the a n i m a figure f r o m t h e d e v o u r i n g a s p e c t o f the m o t h e r i m a g e . Not until this is a c c o m p l i s h e d c a n a m a n a c h i e v e his first t r u e c a p a c i t y for relatedness to women. T h e fact that this man had failed adequately to separate the anima from the mother was emphasized in another dream, in which he encountered a dragon —a symbolic image for the "devouring" aspect of his attachment to his mother. This dragon pursued him, and because he had no weapon .he began to get the worst of the struggle.
Significantly, however, his wife appeared in the dream, and her appearance somehow made the dragon smaller and less threatening. This change in the dream showed that in his marriage the dreamer was belatedly overcoming
Some heroic battles and rescues from Greek m y t h : Far left, Perseus slays Medusa (on a sixth-century B.C. v a s e ) ; left, Perseus w i t h A n d r o m e d a ( f r o m a f i r s t - c e n t u r y B.C. mural) w h o m he saved from a monster. Right, Theseus kills the Minotaur (on a f i r s t - c e n t u r y B.C. j a r ) w a t c h e d by Ariadne; b e l o w , on a Cretan coin (67 B.C.), the M i n o t a u r ' s l a b y r i n t h .



the attachment to his mother. In other words, he h a d to find a m e a n s o f f r e e i n g t h e p s y c h i c energy attached to the mother-son relationship, in order to achieve a more adult relation to women — and, indeed, to adult society as a whole. T h e hero-dragon battle was the symbolic expression of this process of "growing u p . "
But the hero's task has an aim that goes b e y o n d biological a n d m a r i t a l a d j u s t m e n t . It is to liberate the anima as that inner component o f the p s y c h e t h a t is n e c e s s a r y for a n y t r u e creative achievement. In this man's case we have to guess the probability of this outcome b e c a u s e it is not d i r e c t l y stated in the d r e a m o f the Indian journey. But I am sure he would confirm my hypothesis that his journey over the hill and the sight of his goal as a peaceful harbor town contained the rich promise that he would discover his authentic anima function. He would thus be cured of his early resentment at not being given protection (the rainhat) by the woman for his journey through India. (In dreams, significantly placed towns can often be anima symbols.)
T h e man had won this promise of security for himself by his contact with the authentic hero archetype, and had found a new co-operative and related attitude to the group. His sense of rejuvenation naturally followed. He had drawn on the inner source of strength that the
hero archetype represents; he had clarified and developed that part of him which was symbolized by the w o m a n ; and he had, by his ego's heroic act, liberated himself from his mother.
These and many other examples of the hero myth in modern dreams show that the ego as h e r o is a l w a y s essentially a b e a r e r o f c u l t u r e rather than a purely egocentric exhibitionist. Even Trickster, in his misguided or unpurposive w a y , is a c o n t r i b u t o r to the cosmos as primitive man sees it. In Navaho mythology, as Coyote, he hurled the stars into the sky as an act of creation, he invented the necessary contingency of death, and in the myth of emergence he helped lead the people through the hollow reed whereby they escaped from one world to another above it where they were safe from the threat of flood.
W e have here a reference to that form of creative evolution which evidently begins on a childlike, preconscious, or animal level of existence. T h e ego's rise to effective conscious action becomes plain in the true culture-hero. In the same fashion the childish or adolescent ego frees itself from the oppression of parental expectations and becomes individual. As part of this rise to consciousness the hero-dragon battle may have to be fought and refought to liberate energy for the multitude of human tasks that can form a culture pattern out of chaos.



The hero's rescue of a maiden can symbolize the freeing of the anima from the "devouring" aspect of the mother. This aspect is represented, far left, by Balinese dancers wearing the mask of Rangda (left), a malign female spirit; or by the serpent that swallowed and then regurgitated the Greek hero Jason (above).
As in the dream discussed on p 124, a c o m m o n a n i m a s y m b o l is a h a r b o r town Below, a poster by Marc Chagall personifies Nice as a mermaid.



W h e n this is successful, w e see the full h e r o image emerging as a kind of ego strength for, if we are speaking in collective terms, a tribal identity) that has no further need to overcome the monsters and the giants. It has reached the point where these deep forces can be personalized. T h e "feminine element" no longer appears in dreams as a dragon, but as a w o m a n ; similarly, the " s h a d o w " side of the personality takes on a less m e n a c i n g form.
This i m p o r t a n t point is i l l u s t r a t e d in the dream of a man nearing 50. All his life he had suffered from periodic attacks of anxiety associated with fear of failure (originally engendered by a doubting mother). Yet his actual achievements, both in his profession and in his personal relations, were well above average. In his dream his nine-year-old son appeared as a young man of about 18 or 19, dressed in the shining armor of a medieval knight. The young m a n is called u p o n to fight a host o f m e n in black, which he prepares at first to do. Then he suddenly removes his helmet, and smiles at the leader of the m e n a c i n g h o s t ; it is c l e a r that they will not engage in the battle but will become friends.
The son in the d r e a m is the m a n ' s o w n youthful ego, which had frequently felt threatened by the shadow in the form of self-doubt. He had, in a sense, waged a successful crusade against this adversary all his mature life. Now, partly through the actual encouragement of seeing his son grow up without such doubts, but mainly by forming a suitable image of the hero in the form closest to his own environmental p a t t e r n , he finds it n o l o n g e r n e c e s s a r y to fight the s h a d o w ; he c a n a c c e p t it. T h a t is w h a t is s y m b o l i z e d in t h e a c t o f f r i e n d s h i p . H e is n o longer driven to a competitive struggle for individual s u p r e m a c y , b u t is a s s i m i l a t e d to t h e c u l tural task of forming a democratic sort of community. Such a conclusion, reached in the fullness of life, goes beyond the heroic task and leads one to a truly mature attitude.
This change, however, does not take place automatically. It requires a period of transition, w h i c h is expressed in the v a r i o u s f o r m s o f t h e a r c h e t y p e of i n i t i a t i o n .

The archetype of initiation
In a psychological sense the h e r o i m a g e is not to be regarded as identical with the ego proper. It is b e t t e r d e s c r i b e d as the s y m b o l i c m e a n s by which the ego separates itself from the archetypes evoked by the parental images in early childhood. Dr. J u n g has suggested that each human being has originally a feeling of wholeness, a powerful and complete sense of the Self. And from the Self the totality of the psyche the individualized ego-consciousness emerges as the individual grows up.
W i t h i n the past few y e a r s , the works o f c e r t a i n followers of J u n g h a v e b e g u n to d o c u ment the series of events by which the individual ego emerges during the transition from infancy through childhood. This separation can n e v e r b e c o m e final w i t h o u t severe i n j u r y to Unoriginal sense of wholeness. And the ego must continually return to re-establish its relation to
128



the Self in order to maintain a condition of psychic health. It would appear from my studies that the hero m y t h is the first s t a g e in the d i f f e r e n t i a tion of the psyche. I have suggested that it seems to go through a fourfold cycle by which the ego seeks to achieve its relative a u t o n o m y from the original condition o f wholeness. Unless some degree o f a u t o n o m y is a c h i e v e d , the individual is u n a b l e to relate h i m s e l f to his adult environment. But the hero myth does not ensure that this liberation will occur. It only shows how it is possible for it to o c c u r , so that the ego may achieve consciousness. T h e r e remains the problem of maintaining and developing that consciousness in a meaningful way, so that the individual can live a useful life and can achieve the necessary sense of self-distinction in society.
Ancient history and the rituals of contemporary primitive societies h a v e provided us with a wealth of material about myths and rites of initiation, whereby young men and women are weaned away from their parents and forcibly made members of their clan or tribe. But in making this break with the childhood world, the original parent archetype will be injured, and the damage must be made good by a healing process of assimilation into the life of the group. (The identity of the group and the individual is often s y m b o l i z e d by a t o t e m a n i m a l . ) Thus the group fulfills the claims of the injured archetv pe and becomes a kind ol second parent to which the young are first symbolically sacrificed, o n l y to r e - e m e r g e i n t o a n e w life.
In this "drastic ceremony, which looks very like a sacrifice to the powers that might hold the young man b a c k , " as Dr. J u n g has put it,
A primitive t r i b e ' s totem ( o f t e n an animal) symbolizes each tribesman's identity with the tribal unit. Left, an Australian a b o r i g i n e i m i t a t i n g (in a ritual dance) his tribe's totem — a n emu. Many modern groups use t o t e m - l i k e animals as e m b l e m s : Below, a heraldic lion (from the Belgian coat of arms) on a 17thcentury allegorical map of Belgium.

wc sec how the power of the original archetype can never be p e r m a n e n t l y o v e r c o m e , in the manner envisaged by the hero-dragon battle, without a crippling sense ol alienation from the fruitful powers o f the u n c o n s c i o u s . W e saw in the m y t h o f the Twins h o w t h e i r hybris, e x pressing excessive ego-Self separation, was corrected by their own fear of the consequences, which forced them back into a harmonious egoSelf relation.
In t r i b a l societies it is the i n i t i a t i o n rite that most effectively solves this problem. T h e ritual takes the novice back to the deepesl level ol original mother-child identity or ego-Self identity, thus forcing him to experience a symbolic d e a t h . In o t h e r w o r d s , his i d e n t i t y is t e m p o rarily dismembered or dissolved in the collective u n c o n s c i o u s . F r o m this s t a t e he is then c e r e monially rescued by the rite ol the new birth. This is the first act o f t r u e c o n s o l i d a t i o n ol the ego with the larger group, expressed as totem, clan, or tribe, or all three combined.
T h e r i t u a l , w h e t h e r it is f o u n d in t r i b a l groups or in more c o m p l e x societies, invariably insists upon this rite of death and rebirth, which provides the novice with a "rite of passage" from o n e s t a g e o f life to the n e x t , w h e t h e r it is from early childhood to later childhood or from early to late adolescence and from then to maturity.



Initiatory events are not, of course, confined to the p s y c h o l o g y o f y o u t h . E v e r y new p h a s e o f development t h r o u g h o u t a n i n d i v i d u a l ' s life is accompanied by a repetition of the original conflict between the claims of the Sell and the claims ol the ego. In fact, this conflict m a y be expressed more powerfully at the period of transition from early maturity to middle age (between 35 and 4 0 in our society than at any other time in life. And the transition from middle age to old age creates again the need for a f f i r m a t i o n of the d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n the ego and the total p s y c h e ; the h e r o receives his last call to a c t i o n in d e f e n s e o f e g o - c o n s c i o u s ness against the a p p r o a c h i n g dissolution o f life in death.
At these c r u c i a l p e r i o d s , the a r c h e t y p e o f initiation is s t r o n g l y a c t i v a t e d to p r o v i d e a meaningful transition that offers something more spiritually satisfying than the adolescent rites with their strong s e c u l a r flavor. The a r c h e typal patterns ol initiation in this religious sense
known since ancient times as " t h e mysteries" are woven into the texture of all ecclesiastical rituals requiring a special m a n n e r of worship at the time o f b i r t h , m a r r i a g e , or d e a t h .
As in o u r study o f the h e r o m y t h , so in the study o f i n i t i a t i o n we must look for e x a m p l e s in the s u b j e c t i v e e x p e r i e n c e s o f m o d e r n p e o p l e and especially o f those who have undergone
a n a l y s i s . It is not s u r p r i s i n g that t h e r e should a p p e a r , in the u n c o n s c i o u s o f s o m e o n e w h o is seeking help from a doctor specializing in psychic disorders, images that duplicate the major patterns of initiation as we know them from history.
Perhaps the commonest ol these themes to be found in y o u n g p e o p l e is the o r d e a l , o r trial of strength. This might seem to be identical with what we have already noticed in modern dreams illustrating the hero myth, such as the sailor who had to submit to the weather and to beatings, or that proof o f fitness represented in the hike through India of the man without a rainhat. We can also sec this theme of physical suffering carried to its logical end in the first dream I discussed, when the handsome young man became a human sacrifice on an altar. This sacrifice resembled the approach to initiation, but its end was obscured. It seemed to round off the hero cycle, to make way lor a new theme.
T h e r e is o n e striking d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n the hero myth and the initiation rite. The typical hero figures exhaust their efforts in achieving the goal of their a m b i t i o n s ; in short, they become successful even if immediately afterward thev are punished or killed for their hybris. In c o n t r a s t to this, the n o v i c e for i n i t i a tion is c a l l e d u p o n to give up willful a m b i t i o n
Primitive initiation rituals bring the youth i n t o a d u l t h o o d a n d i n t o the tribe's c o l l e c t i v e identity. In many primitive societies, initiation is a c c o m p l i s h e d by c i r c u m c i s i o n (a symbolic sacrifice). Here are four stages in a c i r c u m c i s i o n rite of Australian aborigines. Far left.top and center: The b o y s are placed under blankets (a s y m b o l i c d e a t h from w h i c h they will be reborn).

Right, they are finally isolated from the tribe to be purified a n d g i v e n i n s t r u c t i o n .

and all desire and to submit to the ordeal. He must be willing to experience this trial without hope of success. In fact, he must be prepared to die; and though the token of his ordeal may be mild (a period of fasting, the knocking out of a tooth, or tattooing) or agonizing (the infliction of the wounds of circumcision, subincision, or other mutilations), the purpose remains always the same: To create the symbolic mood of death from which may spring the symbolic mood of rebirth.
A young man of 25 dreams of climbing a mountain on top of which there is a kind of altar. Near the altar he sees a sarcophagus with a statue of himself upon it. Then a veiled priest approaches carrying a staff on which there glows a living sun-disk. (Discussing the dream later, the young man said that climbing a mountain reminded him of the effort he was making in his analysis to achieve self-mastery.) T o his surprise, he finds himself, as it were, dead, and instead of a sense of achievement he feels deprivation and fear. Then comes a feeling of strength and rejuvenation as he is bathed in the warm rays of the sun-disk.
This dream shows quite succinctly the distinction we must make between initiation and the hero myth. The act of climbing the mountain seems to suggest a trial of strength: It is the will to achieve ego-consciousness in the heroic phase of adolescent development. The patient had evidently thought that his approach to therapy would be like his approach to other tests of manhood, which he had approached in the competitive manner characteristic of young men in our society. But the scene by the altar corrected this mistaken assumption, showing him that his task is rather to submit to a power greater than himself. He must see himself as if he were dead and entombed in a symbolic form (the sarcophagus) that recalls the archetypal mother as the original container of all life. Only by such an act of submission can he experience rebirth. An invigorating ritual brings him to life again as the symbolic son of a Sun Father.
Here again we might confuse this with a hero cycle — that of the Twins, the "children of the S u n . " But in this case we have no indication
that the initiate will over-reach himself. Instead, he has learned a lesson in humility by experiencing a rite of death and rebirth that marks his passage from youth to maturity. According to his chronological age he should already have made this transition, but a prolonged period of arrested development has held him back. This delay had plunged him into a neurosis for which he had come for treatment, and the dream offers him the same wise counsel that he could have been given by any good tribal medicine man — that he should give up scaling mountains to prove his strength and submit to the meaningful ritual of an initiatory change that could fit him for the new moral responsibilities of manhood.
T h e theme of submission as an essential attitude toward promotion of the successful initiation rite can be clearly seen in the case of girls or women. Their rite of passage initially emphasizes their essential passivity, and this is reinforced by the psychological limitation on theirautonomyimposedby the menstrual cycle. It has been suggested that the menstrual cycle may actually be the major part of initiation from a woman's point of view, since it has the power to awaken the deepest sense of obedience to life's creative power over her. Thus she willingly gives herself to her womanly function, much as a man gives himself to his assigned role in the community life of his group.
On the other hand, the woman, no less than the man, has her initial trials of strength that

lead to a final s a c r i f i c e for the sake of e x p e r i encing the new birth. This sacrifice enables a woman to free herself from the entanglement of personal relations and fits her for a more conscious role as an individual in her own right. In c o n t r a s t , a m a n ' s s a c r i f i c e is a s u r r e n d e r o f his sacred independence: He becomes more consciously related to woman.
Here we come to that aspect of initiation which acquaints man with woman and woman with m a n in such a way as to correct some sort of original male-female opposition.

But this is e x c e e d i n g l y difficult for m o d e r n people to g r a s p , a n d it f r e q u e n t l y takes a special crisis in their lives to m a k e them understand it.
Several patients have told me dreams in w h i c h the m o t i f o f s a c r i f i c e is c o m b i n e d with the motif of the sacred marriage. One of these was produced by a young man who had fallen in love but was unwilling to m a r r y for fear that marriage would become a kind of prison presided over by a powerful mother figure. His own m o t h e r had been a strong influence in his childhood, and his future mother-in-law presented a similar threat. Would not his wife-to

be dominate him in the same way these mothers had dominated their children?
In 11 is d r e a m he was e n g a g e d in a ritual dance along with another man and two other women, o n e o f w h o m was his fiancee. T h e others were an older man and wife, who impressed thedreamerbecau.se. despite their closen e s s to each other, they seemed to have room for their individual differences, a n d did nol appear to be possessive. These two therefore represented to this young man a married statethat did not impose undue constraint on the development of the individual nature of the two partners. I f it were possible for him to achieve this c o n d i t i o n , m a r r i a g e would then b e c o m e acceptable to him.
In the ritual d a n c e each m a n faced his woman partner, and all four took their places at the corners o f a s q u a r e d a n c i n g g r o u n d . As they d a n c e d , it b e c a m e a p p a r e n t that this was also a kind o f sword d a n c e . E a c h d a n c e r had in his h a n d a short s w o r d with w h i c h to p e r form a difficult a r a b e s q u e , moving arms and legs in a series o f m o v e m e n t s that suggested alternate impulses ol aggression and submission to each o t h e r .

He felt deeply ashamed of his cowardly failure to sacrifice himself with the others.
This dream brought home to my patient the fact that he was more than ready to change his attitude to life. He had been self-centered, seeking the illusory safety of personal independence but inwardly dominated by the fears caused by childhood subjection to his mother. He needed a challenge to his m a n h o o d in order to see that unless he sacrificed his childish state o f mind he would be left isolated and ashamed. T h e dream, and his subsequent insight into its meaning, dispelled his doubts. He had passed through the symbolic rite by which a young man gives up his exclusive autonomy and accepts his shared life in a related, not just heroic, form.
And so he married and found appropriate fulfillment in his relationship with his wife. F a r from impairing his effectiveness in the world, his marriage actually enhanced it.
Quite apart from the neurotic fear that invisible mothers or lathers may be lurking behind the marriage veil, even the normal voting man has good reason to leel apprehensive a b o u t the w e d d i n g r i t u a l .

rape of the bride. These enable the man to cling to the remnants of his heroic role at the very moment that he must submit to his bride and assume the responsibilities of marriage.
But the t h e m e o f m a r r i a g e is an i m a g e o f such universality that it also has a deeper meaning. It is a n a c c e p t a b l e , even necessary, s y m bolic discovery of the feminine component of a m a n ' s o w n p s y c h e , j u s t as m u c h as it is the acquisition of a real wife. So one may encounter this archetype in a man of any age in response to a suitable stimulus.
Not all women, however, react trustingly to the married state. A woman patient who had unfulfilled longings for a career, which she had had to give up for a very difficult and shortlived marriage, dreamed that she was kneeling opposite a man who was also kneeling. He had a ring that he prepared to put on her finger, but she stretched out her right-hand ring finger in a tense manner—evidently resisting this ritual of marital union.
It was easy to point out her significant error. Instead of offering the left-hand ring finger (by
which she could accept a balanced and natural relation to the masculine principle) she had wrongly assumed that she had to put her entire conscious (i.e. right-sided) identity in the service of the man. In fact, marriage required her to share with him only that subliminal, natural (i.e. left-sided) part of herself in which the principle of union would have a symbolic, not a literal or absolute, meaning. Her fear was the fear of the woman who dreads to lose her identity in a strongly patriarchal marriage, which this woman had good reason to resist.
Nevertheless, the sacred marriage as an archetypal form has a particularly important meaning for the psychology of women, and one for which they are prepared during their adolescence by many preliminary events of an initiatory character.
The archetypal sacred marriage (the union of opposites, of the male and female principles) represented here by a 19th-century Indian sculpture of the deities Siva and Parvati.



Beauty and the Beast
Girls in our society share in the masculine hero myths because, like boys, they must also develop a reliable ego-identity and acquire an education. B u t there is an older layer o f the mind that seems to come to the surface in their feelings, with the aim of making them into women, not into imitation men. When this ancient content of the psyche begins to make its a p p e a r a n c e , t h e m o d e r n y o u n g w o m a n m a y repress it because it threatens to cut her off from the emancipated equality of friendship and opportunity to compete with men that have become her modern privileges.
This repression may be so successful that for a time she will maintain an identification with the masculine intellectual goals she learned at school or college. Even when she marries, she will preserve some illusion o f freedom, despite her ostensible act of submission to the archetype of marriage—with its implicit injunction to become a mother. And so there may occur, as we very f r e q u e n t l y see t o d a y , t h a t conflict which in the end forces the woman to rediscover her buried womanhood in a painful (but ultimately rewarding) manner.
I saw an example of this in a young married woman who did not yet have any children but who intended to have one or two eventually, because it would be expected of her. M e a n while her sexual response was unsatisfactory. This worried her and her husband, though they were unable to offer any explanation for it. She had graduated with honors from a good women's college and enjoyed a life of intellectual companionship with her husband and other men. Although this side of her life went well enough much of the time, she had occasional outbursts of temper and talked in an aggressive fashion that alienated men and gave her an intolerable feeling of dissatisfaction with herself.
She had a dream at this time that seemed so important she sought professional advice to understand it. She dreamed she was in a line
of young women like herself, and as she looked a h e a d to where they were going she saw that as each came to the head of the line she was decapitated by a guillotine. Without any fear the dreamer remained in the line, presumably quite willing to submit to the same treatment when her turn came.
I explained to her that this meant she was ready to give up the habit of "living in her h e a d " ; she must learn to free her body to discover its natural sexual response and the fulfillment of its biological role in motherhood. T h e dream expressed this as the need to make a drastic change; she had to sacrifice the "masculine" hero role.
As one might expect, this educated woman had no difficulty in accepting this interpretation at an intellectual level, and she set about trying to change herself into a more submissive kind of woman. She did then improve her love-life and became the mother of two very satisfactory children. As she grew to know herself better, she began to sec that for a man (or the mascul i n e - t r a i n e d m i n d in w o m e n ) life is s o m e t h i n g that has to be taken by storm, as an act of the heroic will; but for a woman to feel right about herself, life is best realized by a process of awakening.
A universal myth expressing this kind of a w a k e n i n g is f o u n d in the fairy tale o f B e a u t y and the Beast. T h e best-known version of this story relates how Beauty, the youngest of four daughters, becomes her father'sfavorite because of her unselfish goodness. W h e n she asks her father only for a white rose, instead of the more costly presents d e m a n d e d by the others, she is aware only of her inner sincerity of feeling. She does not know that she is a b o u t to e n d a n g e r her father's life and her ideal relation with him. For he steals the white rose from the enchanted g a r d e n o f Beast, w h o is stirred to a n g e r by the theft and requires him to return in three months for his punishment, presumably death.

(In allowing the lather this reprieve to go home with his gilt. Beast behaves out of character, especially when he also oilers to send him a trunk full of gold when he gets home. As Beauty's father comments, the Beast seems cruel and kind at the same time.)
Beauty insists upon taking her father's punishment and returns after three months to the e n c h a n t e d c a s t l e . T h e r e she is given a b e a u t i f u l room where she has no worries and nothing to fear except the occasional visits of Beast, who repeatedly comes to ask her if she will someday marry him. She always refuses. Then, seeing in a magic mirror a picture of her father lying ill. she begs Beast to allow her to return to comfort him, promising to return in a week. Beast tells her that he will die if she deserts him. but she may go for a week.
At home, her radiant presence brings joy to her lather and envy to her sisters, who plot to detain her longer than her promised stay. At length she d r e a m s that Beast is d y i n g o f d e s p a i r . So. realizing she has overstayed her time, she returns to resuscitate him.
Quite forgetting the dying Beast's ugliness. Beauty ministers to him. He tells her that_hc was unable to live without her. and that he will die happy now that she has returned. But Beauty realizes that she cannot live without Beast, that she has fallen in love with him. S h e tells him so. and promises to be his wile if only he will noi die.
At this the c a s t l e is Idled with a b l a z e o f light and the sound of music, and Beast disappears. In his place stands a handsome prince, who tells Beauty that he had been enchanted by a witch and turned into the Beast. The spell was ordained to last until a beautiful girl should love Beast for his goodness alone.
In this story, if we unravel the symbolism, we a r e likely to see that B e a u t y is any y o u n g girl or woman who has entered into an emotional bond with her lather, no less binding because o f its spiritual n a t u r e . H e r g o o d n e s s is s y m b o l ized by her request lor a white rose, but in a significant twist of meaning her unconscious intention puts her lather and then herself in the power of a principle that expresses not goodness alone, but cruelty and kindness comb i n e d . It is as if she wished to be rescued from a love holding her to an exclusively virtuous and unreal attitude.
Bv learning to love Beast she awakens to the power of h u m a n love concealed in its animal and therefore imperfect but genuinely erotic form. Presumably this represents an awakening of her true function of relatcdncss, enabling her to accept the erotic component of her original wish, which had to be repressed because ol a fear of incest. To leave her father she had. as it w e r e , lo a c c e p t the i n c c s l - l e a r . to allow herself to live in its presence in fantasy until she could get to know the animal man and discover her own true response to it as a w o m a n .
Three scenes from the 1946 film of Beauty and the Beast ( d i r e c t e d b y France's Jean Cocteau): Left, Beauty's father caught stealing the white rose from the Beast's garden; right, the Beast d y i n g ; far right, the Beast transformed into a Prince, walking with Beauty. The story can be said to symbolize a young girl's initiation — i.e. her release f r o m her bond with the father, in order to come to terms with the erotic animal side of her nature. Until this is d o n e , she c a n n o t a c h i e v e a true relationship with a man.



In ihis way she redeems herself and her image ol the masculine from the forces o f repression, bringing to consciousness her capacity to trust her love as s o m e t h i n g that c o m b i n e s spirit and nature in the best sense o f the words.
A d r e a m <>l an e m a n c i p a t e d w o m a n p a t i e n t ol mine r e p r e s e n t e d this need to r e m o v e the incest-fear, a very real fear in this patient's thoughts, because ol her father's over-close attachment to her following his wife's death. I he dream showed her being chased In a furious bull. S h e lied at first, but r e a l i z e d it was no use. S h e fell and the bull was upon her. S h e knew her only hope was to sing to the bull, a n d when she did. though in a q u a v e r i n g voice, the hull c a l m e d down and began licking her hand with its tongue. T h e interpretation showed that she could now learn to relate to men in a m o r e confidently feminine way not only sexually, hut erotically in the wider sense o f relatedness on the level ol her conscious identity.
But in the cases o f older w o m e n , the Beasi theme may not indicate the need to find the answer to a personal fixation or to release a sexual inhibition, or any of the things that the psychoanalytically minded rationalist may see in the m y t h . It c a n b e . in fact, (he expression ol a certain kind o f w o m a n ' s initiation, which may be just as meaningful al the onset of the menopause as at the height o f adolesc e n c e ; a n d it may a p p e a l at a n y a g e . when the union ol spirit a n d n a t u r e has been d i s t u r b e d .
A woman of menopausal age reported the
following dream:
I am with several anonymous women whom I don't seem to know. W e go downstairs in a strange house, and are confronted suddenly by some grotesque "ape-men'' with evil laces dressed in fur with trray and black rings, with tails, horrible and leering. W e arc completely in their power, but suddenly I feel the only way we can save ourselves is not to panic and run or fight, but to treat these creatures with humanity as il to make them aware of their better side. So one ol the ape-men comes up to me and I greet him like a dancing partner and begin to dance with him. Later. I have been given supernatural healing powers and there is a man who is at death's door. I have a kind of quill or perhaps a bird's beak through which I blow air into his nostrils and he begins to breathe again.
During the years of her marriage and the raising of her children, this woman bad been obliged to neglect her creative gill, with which she had once made a small but genuine reputation as a writer. At the lime of her d r e a m she bad been trying to force herself back to work again, at the same time criticizing hersell unmercifully lor not being a better wife, friend, and mother. T h e dream showed her problem in the light o f o t h e r w o m e n w h o might be going through a similar transition, descending, as the d r e a m puts il. into the lower regions ol a strange bouse from a too highly conscious level.



This we can guess to be the entrance to some meaningful aspect of the collective unconscious, with its challenge to accept the masculine principle as animal-man, that same heroic, clownlike Trickster figure we met at the beginning of the primitive hero cycles.
For her to relate to this ape-man, and hum a n i z e h i m by b r i n g i n g out w h a t is good in him, meant that she would first have to accept some unpredictable element of her natural creative spirit. With this she could cut across the conventional bonds of her life and learn to write in a new way, more appropriate for her in the second part o f life.
T h a t this impulse is related to the creative m a s c u l i n e p r i n c i p l e is shown in the second scene where she resuscitates a man by blowing air through a kind of bird's beak into his nose. This pneumatic procedure suggests the need for a revival of the spirit rather than the principle o f erotic w a r m t h . It is a s y m b o l i s m k n o w n all over the world: T h e ritual act brings the creative breath of life to any new achievement.
The dream of another woman emphasizes the "nature" aspect of Beauty and the Beast:
Something flies or is thrown in through the window, like a large insect with whirling spiral legs, yellow and black. It then becomes a queer animal, striped yellow and black, like a tiger, with bear-like, almost human paws and a pointed wolflike face. It may run loose and harm children. It is Sunday afternoon, and I see a little girl all dressed in white on her way to Sunday school. I must get the police to help. But then I see the creature has become part woman, part animal. It fawns upon me, wants to be loved. I feel it's a fairy-tale situation, or a dream, and only kindness can transform it. I try to embrace it warmly, but I can't go through with it. I push it away. But I have the feeling I must keep it near and get used to it and maybe someday I'll be able to kiss it.
Here we have a different situation from the previous one. This woman had been too intensively carried away by the masculine creative function within herself, which had become a compulsive, mental (that is, " a i r - b o r n e " ) preoccupation. Thus she has been prevented from
discharging her feminine, wifely function in a natural way. (In association to this dream she said: "When my husband comes home, my creative side goes underground and I become the over-organized housewife.") Her dream takes this unexpected turn of transforming her spirit gone bad into the woman she must accept and cultivate in herself; in this way she can harmonize her creative intellectual interests with the instincts that enable her to relate warmly to others.
This involves a new acceptance of the dual p r i n c i p l e o f life in n a t u r e , o f that w h i c h is cruel but kind, or, as we might say in her case, ruthlessly adventurous but at the same time humbly and creatively domestic. These opposites obviously cannot be reconciled except on a highly sophisticated psychological level of awareness, and would of course be harmful to that innocent child in her Sunday-school dress.
T h e interpretation one could place on this w o m a n ' s d r e a m is t h a t she n e e d e d to o v e r c o m e some excessively naive image of herself. She had to be willing to e m b r a c e the full polarity of her feelings — just as Beauty had to give up the innocence of trusting in a father who could not give her the pure white rose of his feeling without awakening the beneficent fury of the Beast.

Orpheus and the Son of Man
" B e a u t y a n d the B e a s t " is a fairy tale with the quality of a wild flower, appearing so unexpectedly and creating in us such a natural sense of wonder that we do not notice for the moment that it belongs to a definite class, genus, a n d species of plant. T h e kind of mystery inherent in such a story is given a universal a p p l i c a t i o n not only in a larger historical myth, but also in the rituals w h e r e b y the m y t h is expressed o r from which it may be derived.
The type of ritual and myth appropriately expressing this type of psychological experience is e x e m p l i f i e d in t h e G r e c o - R o m a n r e l i g i o n o f Dionysus, and in its successor, the religion of Orpheus. Both of these religions provided a significant initiation of the type known as "mysteries." They brought forth symbols associated with a god-man of androgynous character who was supposed to have an intimate understanding of the animal or plant world and to be the master of initiation into their secrets.
The Dionysiac religion contained orgiastic rites that implied the need for an initiate to
abandon himself to his animal nature and thereby experience the full fertilizing power of the Earth Mother. T h e initiating agent for this rite of passage in the Dionysiac ritual was wine. It was supposed to produce the symbolic lowering of consciousness necessary to introduce the novice into the closely guarded secrets of nature, whose essence was expressed by a symbol of erotic fulfillment: the god Dionysus joined with Ariadne, his consort, in a sacred marriage ceremony.
In time the rites of Dionysus lost their emotive religious power. There emerged an almost oriental longing for liberation from their exclusive preoccupation with the purely natural symbols of life and love. T h e Dionysiac religion, shifting constantly from spiritual to physical and back again, perhaps proved too wild and turbulent for some more ascetic souls. These came to experience their religious ecstasies inwardly, in the worship of Orpheus.
Orpheus was probably a real man, a singer, prophet, and teacher, who was martyred and

whose tomb became a shrine. No wonder the early Christian c h u r c h saw in O r p h e u s the prototype of Christ. Both religions brought to the late Hellenistic world the promise of a future divine life. Because they were men, yet also mediators of the divine, for the multitudes of the dying G r e c i a n culture in the days of the Roman Empire they held the longed-for hope of a future life.
There was, however, one important difference between the religion ol O r p h e u s and the religion of Christ. Though sublimated into a mystical form, the Orphic mysteries kept alive the old Dionysiac religion. T h e spiritual impetus c a m e from a d e m i - g o d , in w h o m was preserved the most significant cpiality of a religion rooted in the art of agriculture. That cpiality was the old pattern of the fertility gods who c a m e only for the season in other words, the eternally recurrent cycle of birth, growth, fullness, and decay.
Christianity, on the other hand, dispelled the mysteries. Christ was the product and reformer of a p a t r i a r c h a l , n o m a d i c , p a s t o r a l r e l i g i o n , whose prophets represented their Messiah as a being of absolutely divine origin. The Son of M a n . though born of a human virgin, had his beginning in heaven, whence he c a m e in an
act of G o d ' s incarnation in m a n . Alter his death, he returned to heaven but returned o n c e a n d for all. to reign on the right h a n d ol God until the Second Coming "when the dead shall arise."
O f course the asceticism of early Christianity did not last. T h e memory of the cyclic mysteries haunted its followers to the extent that the Church eventually had to incorporate many practices from the pagan past into its rituals. T h e most m e a n i n g f u l ol these may be found in the old records of what was done on Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday in celebration o f the resurrection of Christ the baptismal service that the medieval church made into a suitable and deeply meaningful initiation rite. But that ritual has scarcely survived into modern t i m e s , a n d it is c o m p l e t e l y a b s e n t in P r o testantism.
T h e ritual that has survived much better, and that still contains the meaning of a central initiation mystery for the d e v o u t , is the C a t h o l i c practice of the elevation of the chalice. It has b e e n d e s c r i b e d by D r . J u n g in his " T r a n s f o r mation Symbolism in the M a s s " :
" T h e lifting up of the chalice in the air prepares the spiritualization . . . of the wine. This is c o n f i r m e d by the i n v o c a t i o n to the Holy

After the elevation, the chalice was, in former times, set down to the right of the Host, to correspond with the blood that flowed from the right side o f C h r i s t . "
T h e ritual o f c o m m u n i o n is e v e r y w h e r e the same, w h e t h e r it is e x p r e s s e d by d r i n k i n g o f t h e cup of Dionysus or of the holy Christian chalice; but the level ol awareness each brings to (he i n d i v i d u a l p a r t i c i p a n t is d i f f e r e n t . The Dionysiac participant looks back to the origin ol things, to the " s t o r m - b i r t h " o f t h e g o d w h o is blasted f r o m the resistant w o m b o f M o t h e r Earth. In the frescoes of the Villa de Misteri in Pompeii, the enacted rite evoked the god as a mask of terror reflected in the cup o f Dionysus offered by the priest to the initiate. Eater we find the w i n n o w i n g basket, with its precious fruits of the earth, and the phallus as creative symbols of the god's manifestation as the principle of breeding and growth.
In contrast to this b a c k w a r d look, with its central focus on nature's eternal cycle of birth and death, the Christian mystery points forward to the initiate's u l t i m a t e hope of union with a transcendent god. M o t h e r N a t u r e , with

all her beautiful seasonal c h a n g e s , has been left behind, and the central figure of Christianity offers spiritual certainty, for he is the S o n o f God in heaven. Yet the two s o m e h o w fuse in the figure of Orpheus, the god who remembers Dionysus but looks forward to Christ. T h e psychological sense o f this i n t e r m e d i a t e figure has b e e n d e scribed by the Swiss author Linda Fierz-David, in her i n t e r p r e t a t i o n o f t h e O r p h i c rite p i c t u r e d in the V i l l a de M i s t e r i :
"Orpheus taught while he sang and played the lyre, and his singing was so powerful that it m a s t e r e d all n a t u r e ; w h e n he s a n g to his lyre the birds flew a b o u t h i m , the fish left t h e water and sprang to him. T h e wind and the sea b e c a m e still, t h e rivers flowed u p w a r d t o ward him. It did not snow and there was no hail. Trees and the very stones followed after Orpheus; tiger and lion lay down near him next to the sheep, and the wolves next to the stag and the roe. Now what does this m e a n ? It surely m e a n s that through a divine insight into the m e a n i n g o f natural events . . . nature's happenings become harmoniously ordered from within. Everything becomes light and all creatures appeased when the m e d i a t o r , in the act of worshiping, represents the light of nature. Orpheus is an e m b o d i m e n t o f devotion a n d piety; he symbolizes the religious attitude that solves all conflicts, since t h e r e b y the whole soul is turned t o w a r d t h a t w h i c h lies o n t h e o t h e r side of all conflict. . . . A n d as he does this, h e is truly O r p h e u s ; t h a t is, a g o o d s h e p h e r d , his primitive embodiment. . . . "
Both as good shepherd and as mediator. Orpheus strikes the balance between the Dionysiac religion and the Christian religion, since we find b o t h D i o n y s u s a n d C h r i s t in s i m i l a r roles, though, as I have said, differently oriented as to t i m e a n d d i r e c t i o n in s p a c e o n e a cyclic religion of the n e t h e r world, the o t h e r heavenly a n d e s c h a t o l o g i c a l , o r final. T h i s series of initiatory events, drawn from the context of religious history, is r e p e a t e d endlessly a n d with practically every conceivable individual twist of meaning in the d r e a m s a n d fantasies o f modern people.
In a state of heavy fatigue and depression, a woman undergoing analysis had this fantasy:
I sit on the side of a long narrow table in a high vaulted room with no window. My body is hunched over and shrunken. T h e r e is nothing over me but a long white linen cloth that hangs from my shoulders to the floor. Something crucial has happened to me. T h e r e is not much life lelt in me. Red crosses on gold disks appear before my eyes. I recall that I have made some sort of commitment a long time ago and wherever I am now must be part of this. I sit there a long time. Now I slowly open my eyes and I see a man who sits beside me who is to heal me. He appears natural and kind and he is talking to me though I don't hear him. He seems to know all about where I have been. I am aware that I am very ugly and that there must be an odor of death around me. I wonder if he will be repelled. 1 look at him for a very long time. He does not turn away. I breathe more easily. T h e n I feel a cool breeze, or cool water, pour over my body. I wrap the white linen cloth across me now and prepare for a natural sleep. T h e man's healing bands are on my shoulders. I recall vaguely that there was a time when there were wounds there but the pressure of his hands seems to give me strength and healing.
This woman had previously felt threatened bv d o u b t s a b o u t h e r o r i g i n a l religious affiliation. She had been brought up as a devout
'45



Catholic of the old school, but since her youth she had struggled to free herself from the formal religious conventions followed by her family. Yet the symbolic events of the church year and the richness of her insight into their meaning remained with her throughout the process of her psychological c h a n g e ; and in her analysis I found this working knowledge of religious symbolism most helpful.
T h e significant elements she singled out of her fantasy were the white cloth, which she understood as a sacrificial cloth; the vaulted room, which she considered to be a t o m b ; and her commitment, which she associated with the experience of submission. This commitment, as she called it, suggested a ritual of initiation with a perilous descent into the vault of death, which symbolized the way she had left church and family to experience God in her own fashion. She had undergone an " i m i t a t i o n of C h r i s t " in the true symbolic sense, and like him she had suffered the wounds that preceded this death.
T h e sacrificial cloth suggests the winding sheet or shroud in which the crucified Christ was wrapped and then placed in the tomb. T h e end of the fantasy introduces the healing figure of a man, loosely associated with me as her analyst but appearing also in his natural role as a friend fully aware of her experience. He speaks to her in words she cannot yet hear, but his hands are reassuring and give a sense of healing. O n e senses in this figure the touch and the word of the good shepherd, Orpheus or Christ, as mediator and also, of course, as h e a l e r . H e is o n t h e side of life a n d has to c o n vince her that she may now come back from the vault of death.
Shall we call this rebirth or resurrection? Both, perhaps, or neither. T h e essential rite proclaims itself at the end: T h e cool breeze or w a t e r flowing o v e r h e r b o d y is the p r i m o r d i a l act of purification or cleansing of the sin of death, the essence of true baptism.
T h e same w o m a n had a n o t h e r fantasy in which she felt that her birthday fell upon the day of Christ's resurrection. (This was much more meaningful for her than the memory of her mother, who had never given her the feel
146



ing of reassurance a n d r e n e w a l she so m u c h wished for on h e r c h i l d h o o d birthdays.) But this did not m e a n she identified h e r s e l f with the figure o f C h r i s t . F o r all his p o w e r a n d glory, something was lacking; and as she tried to reach h i m t h r o u g h p r a y e r , he a n d his cross were lifted up to h e a v e n out o f h e r human reach.
In this second fantasy she fell back upon the symbol of rebirth as a rising sun, and a new feminine symbol began to make its appearance. First of all it a p p e a r e d as an " e m b r y o in a watery sack." T h e n she was carrying an eightyear-old boy through the water "passing a danger point." T h e n a new movement occurred in which she n o l o n g e r felt t h r e a t e n e d o r u n d e r the influence o f d e a t h . S h e was " i n a forest by a little spring waterfall . . . green vines grow all around. In my hands I have a stone bowl in which there is spring w a t e r , some green moss, and violets. I b a t h e m y s e l f u n d e r the waterfall. It is golden a n d ' s i l k y ' a n d I feel like a c h i l d . "
T h e sense o f these events is c l e a r , t h o u g h it is possible to miss the inner m e a n i n g in the cryptic description o f so m a n y c h a n g i n g i m a g e s . Here we have, it seems, a process of rebirth in which a larger spiritual self is r e b o r n a n d b a p tized in n a t u r e as a c h i l d . M e a n w h i l e she has rescued an older child who was, in some way, her own ego at the most t r a u m a t i c period o f her c h i l d h o o d . S h e t h e n c a r r i e d it t h r o u g h water past the danger point, thus indicating her fear of a p a r a l y z i n g sense of guilt if she should
depart too far from her family's conventional religion. B u t religious s y m b o l i s m is significant by its a b s e n c e . All is in the hands o f n a t u r e ; we are clearly in the realm of the shepherd Orpheus rather than the risen Christ.
A dream followed this sequence, which brought her to a church resembling the church in Assisi with Giotto's frescoes of St. Francis. S h e felt more at h o m e here than she would in other churches because St. Francis, like Orpheus, was a religious man of nature. This revived her feelings about the change in her religious affiliation that had been so painful to undergo, but now she believed she could joyfully face the experience, inspired by the light of nature.
T h e series of dreams ended with a distant echo of the religion of Dionysus. (One could say that this was a reminder that even Orpheus can at times be a little too far removed from the fecundating power of the animal-god in man.) She dreamed that she was leading a fairhaired child by the hand. " W e are happily participating in a festival that includes the sun and the forests and flowers all around. T h e child has a little white flower in her hand, and she places it on the head o f a black bull. T h e bull is p a r t o f the festival a n d is covered with festive decorations." This reference recalls the ancient rites that celebrated Dionysus in the guise of a bull.
But the dream did not end there. T h e w o m a n a d d e d : " S o m e t i m e l a t e r the bull is
Above left, the Persian god Mithras sacrificing the bull. The sacrifice (also part of D i o n y s i a c rites) c a n be seen as a s y m b o l of t h e v i c t o r y of man's spiritual n a t u r e o v e r his a n i m a l i t y — o f w h i c h t h e bull is a common symbol. (This may explain the popularity in s o m e c o u n t r i e s of b u l l f i g h t i n g , left.) R i g h t , an etching by Picasso (1 9 3 5 ) depicts a girl threatened by a M i n o t a u r here, as in the m y t h of T h e s e u s , a symbol of man's uncontrollable instinctive forces.



pierced by a golden arrow." Now, besides Dionysus, there is a n o t h e r pre-Christian rite in which the bull plays a symbolic role. The Persian sun-god Mithras sacrifices a bull. He, like Orpheus, represents the longing for a life of the spirit that might triumph over the primitive animal passions of man and, after a ceremony of initiation, give him peace.
This series of images confirms a suggestion that is found in m a n y fantasy or d r e a m s e q u e n c e s o f this t y p e t h a t t h e r e is n o final peace, no resting point. In their religious quest men and women — especially those who live in modern Western Christianized societies — are still in the power of those early traditions that strive within t h e m for s u p r e m a c y , It is a c o n flict of pagan or Christian beliefs, or, one might say, of rebirth or resurrection.
A more direct clue to the solution of this d i l e m m a is to b e f o u n d , in this w o m a n ' s first fantasy, in a curious piece of symbolism that could easily be overlooked. T h e woman says that in her death vault she saw before her eyes a vision of red crosses on gold disks. As became clear later in her analysis, she was about to experience a profound psychic change and to emerge out of this " d e a t h " into a new kind of life. W e might imagine, therefore, that this image, which c a m e to her in the depth of her despair o f life, should in some way herald her future religiousattitude. In her subsequent work she did in fact produce evidence for thinking that the red crosses represented her devotion to the Christian attitude, while the gold disks represented her devotion to the pre-Christian mystery religions. Her vision had told her that she must reconcile these Christian and pagan elements in the new life that lay ahead.
O n e last, but important, observation concerns the ancient initiation rites and their relation to Christianity. The initiation rite celebrated in the Eleusinian mysteries (the rites of worship of the fertility goddesses Demeter and Persephone] was not considered appropriate merely for those who sought to live life more abundantly; it was also used as a preparation for death, as if death also required an initiatory rite of passage of the same kind.
O n a funeral urn found in a R o m a n grave near the Columbarium on the Esquiline Hill we find a clear bas-relief representing scenes of the final s t a g e o f i n i t i a t i o n w h e r e the n o v i c e is admitted to the presence and converse of the goddesses. T h e rest o f the design is devoted to two preliminary ceremonies of purification— the sacrifice of the "mystic pig," and a mysticized version of the sacred marriage. This all points to an initiation into death, but in a form that l a c k s t h e finality o f m o u r n i n g . It h i n t s at t h a t element of the later mysteries — especially of Orphism which makes death carry a promise of immortality. Christianity went even further. It promised something more than immortality (which in the old sense of the cyclic mysteries might merely mean reincarnation), for itoffered the faithful an everlasting life in heaven.
So we see again, in modern life, the tendency to repeat old patterns. Those who have to learn to face death may have to relearn the old message t h a t tells us t h a t d e a t h is a mystery for which we must prepare ourselves in the same spirit of s u b m i s s i o n a n d h u m i l i t y as we o n c e learned to prepare ourselves for life.

Symbols of transcendence
The symbols that influence man vary in their purpose. S o m e men need to be aroused, and experience their initiation in the violence of a Dionysiac " t h u n d e r rite." Others need to be subdued, and they are brought to submission in the ordered design o f t e m p l e precinct or sacred cave, suggestive o f the A p o l l o n i a n religion of later Greece. A full initiation embraces both themes, as we can see when we look either at the material d r a w n from a n c i e n t texts or at living subjects. But it is q u i t e c e r t a i n that the fundamental goal of initiation lies in taming the original Trickster-like wildness of the juvenile nature. It therefore has a civilizing or spiritualizing purpose, in spite o f the violence o f the rites that a r e r e q u i r e d to set this process in motion.
There is, however, another kind o f symbolism, belonging to the earliest known sacred traditions, that is also c o n n e c t e d with the periods of
transition in a persons life. But these symbols do not seek to integrate the initiate with any religious doctrine or secular group-consciousness. O n the contrary, they point to man's need for l i b e r a t i o n from a n y s t a t e o f b e i n g t h a t is too immature, too fixed or final. In other words, they concern man's release from or transcendence of—any confining pattern of existence, as he moves toward a superior or more mature stage in his development.
A child, as I have said, possesses a sense of completeness, but only before the initial emergence of his ego-consciousness. In the case of an a d u l t , a sense o f c o m p l e t e n e s s is a c h i e v e d t h r o u g h a u n i o n of" the c o n s c i o u s n e s s with the unconscious contents of the mind. O u t of this union arises what J u n g called "the transcendent function of the psyche," by which a man can achieve his highest goal: the full realization of the potential of his individual Self.
Both a bird and a shaman (i.e. a primitive medicine man) are common symbols of transcendence, and often are c o m b i n e d : Left, a prehistoric cave painting at Lascaux shows a shaman in a bird mask. Below, a shaman priestess of a Siberian people, in a bird costume. Right, a shaman's coffin (also Siberian) with bird figures on the posts

T h u s , w h a t we call " s y m b o l s of transcendence" are the symbols that represent man's striving to attain this goal. T h e y provide the means by which the contents of the unconscious can enter the conscious mind, and they also are themselves an active expression of those contents.
These symbols are manifold inform. Whether we e n c o u n t e r t h e m in history or in the d r e a m s of contemporary men and women who are at a critical stage in their lives, we can see their importance. At the most archaic level of this symbolism we again meet the Trickster theme. But this time he no longer appears as a lawless would-be hero. He has become the shaman the medicine m a n —whose magical practices and flights of intuition stamp him as a primitive master of initiation. His power resides in his supposed ability to leave his body and fly about the universe as a bird.
In this case the bird is the most fitting s y m b o l of transcendence. It represents the peculiar nature of intuition working through a " m e d i u m , " t h a t is, a n i n d i v i d u a l w h o is c a p a b l e of obtaining knowledge of distant events —or facts of which he consciously knows n o t h i n g by going i n t o a t r a n c e l i k e s t a t e .
Evidence of such powers can be found as far back as the paleolithic period of prehistory, as the American scholar Joseph Campbell has pointed out in commenting upon one of the famous cave paintings recently discovered in F r a n c e . At L a s c a u x , he writes, " t h e r e is a shaman depicted, lying in a trance, wearing a bird mask with a figure of a bird perched on a staff beside him. The shamans of Siberia wear such bird costumes to this day, and many are believed to have been conceived by their mothers from the descent of a bird . . . . T h e shaman, then, is not only a familiar denizen, but even the favored scion of those realms of power that are invisible to our normal waking consciousness, which all may visit briefly in vision, but through which he roams, a master."
At the highest level of this type of initiatory activity, far from those tricks-of-the-trade by which magic so frequently replaces true spiritual i n s i g h t , we find t h e H i n d u m a s t e r yogis. I n their trance states they go far beyond the normal categories of thought.
O n e of the commonest dream symbols for this type o f release through transcendence is the theme of the lonely journey or pilgrimage, which somehow seems to be a spiritual pilgrim
ln myths or dreams, a lonely t o u r n e y often symbolizes the liberation of transcendence. Above left, a 1 5th-century painting of the poet Dante holding his b o o k ( t h e Divine Comedy) which relates his dream of a journey to hell (lower left of picture), purgatory, and heaven. Far left, an engraving of the lourney made by the pilgrim in the British author J o h n
Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1 6 7 8 ) . (Note that the journey isa circular movement toward an inner center.) This book, too, is told as a dream; left, the pilgrim d r e a m i n g .

age on which the initiate becomes acquainted with the n a t u r e o f d e a t h . But this is not d e a t h as a last j u d g m e n t or other initiatory trial of s t r e n g t h ; it is a j o u r n e y o f r e l e a s e , r e n u n c i a tion, and atonement, presided over and fostered by s o m e spirit o f c o m p a s s i o n . T h i s spirit is m o r e often represented by a "mistress" rather than a "master" of initiation, a supreme feminine (i.e. anima) figure such as K w a n - Y i n in Chinese Buddhism, Sophia in the Christian-Gnostic doctrine, or the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom Pallas Athena.
Not only the flight of birds or the journey into the wilderness represents this symbolism, but any strong movement exemplifying release. I n the first part o f life, when one is still a t t a c h e d to the original family and social group, this may be experienced as that moment of initiation at which one must learn to take the decisive steps into life a l o n e . It is the m o m e n t that T . S. Eliot describes in " T h e Waste L a n d , " when one faces
The awful daring of a moment's surrender, which an age of prudence can never retract.
At a.later period oflife one may not need to break all ties with the symbols of meaningful containment. But nonetheless one can be filled with that spirit of divine discontent which forces
all free men to face some new discovery or to live their lives in a new way. This change may become especially important in the period between m i d d l e a g e a n d old a g e , w h i c h is the time in life when so many people are considering what to do in their retirement whether to work or to play, whether to stay at home or to travel.
If their lives have been adventurous, insecure, or full of change, they may long for a settled life and the consolations of religious certainty. But if they have lived chiefly within the social pattern in which they were born, they may desperately need a liberating change. This need may be filled, temporarily, by a trip around the world, or by nothing more than a move to a smaller house. But none of these external changes will serve unless there has been some inner transcendence of old values in creating, not just inventing, a new pattern oflife.
A case o f this l a t t e r sort is a w o m a n who had lived in a style oflife that she, her family, and friends had long enjoyed because it was so well rooted, culturally nourishing, and secure from transitory fashions. She had this dream:
I found some strange pieces of wood, not carved but with natural beautiful shapes. Some

T h e s y m b o l of the snake is c o m m o n l y linked with transcendence, because it w a s traditionally a creature of the underworld — and thus was a "mediator" between one way of life and another.

one said: '"Neanderthal man brought t h e m . " Then I saw at a distance these Neanderthal men looking like a dark mass, but I could not see one of them distinctly. I thought I would take back from this place a piece of their wood. Then I went on, as if on a journey by myself, and I looked down into an enormous abyss like an extinct volcano. T h e r e was water in part of it and there I expected to see more Neanderthal men. But instead I saw black water pigs that had come out of the water and were running in and out of the black volcanic rocks.
In contrast to this woman's family attachments and her highly cultivated style of life, the dream takes her to a prehistoric period more primitive than anything we can visualize. She can find no social group among these ancient men: She sees them as an embodiment of a truly unconscious, collective "dark mass" in the d i s t a n c e . Y e t t h e y a r e a l i v e , a n d she m a y carry away a piece of their wood. T h e dream emphasizes t h a t the wood is n a t u r a l , not c a r v e d ; therefore it comes from a primordial, not a culturally conditioned, level of the unconscious. The piece o f wood, remarkable for its great age, links this w o m a n ' s c o n t e m p o r a r y experience to the distant origins o f h u m a n life.
We know from many examples that an ancient tree or plant represents symbolically the
growth and development of psychic life (as distinct from instinctual life, commonly symbolized by animals). Hence, in this piece of wood, this woman acquired a symbol of her link with the deepest layers of the collective unconscious.
Next she speaks of continuing her journey alone. This theme, as I have already pointed out, symbolizes the need for release as an initiatory experience. So here we have another symbol of transcendence.
T h e n , in the dream, she sees a huge crater of an extinct volcano, which has been the channel for a violent eruption of fire from the deepest layers of the earth. W e can surmise that this refers to a significant memory trace, which leads back to a traumatic experience. This she associated to a personal experience early in her life when she had felt the destructive, yet creative, force of her passions to such an extent that she feared she would go out of her mind. She had found, in late adolescence, a quite unexpected need to break away from her family's excessively conventional social pattern. She had achieved this break without serious distress, and had been able to return eventually to make her peace with the family. But there lingered a profound wish to make a still greater differentiation from her family background and to find freedom from her own pattern of existence.
This dream recalls another. It came from a young man who had a totally different problem but who seemed to need a similar type of insight. He too had the urge to achieve differentiation. He d r e a m e d of a volcano, and from its c r a t e r he saw two birds taking flight as if in fear that the volcano was about to erupt. This was in a strange, lonely place with a body of water between him and the volcano. In this case, the dream represented an individual initiation journey. .
It is similar to cases r e p o r t e d a m o n g the simple food-gathering tribes, which are the least family-conscious groups we know. In these societies the young initiate must take a lonely journey to a sacred place (in Indian cultures of the North Pacific coast, it m a y actually be a crater lake) where, in a visionary or trancelike state, he encounters his "guardian spirit" in the
'53



form of an animal, a bird, or natural object. He closely identifies himself with this "bush souT'and thereby becomesa man. Withoutsuch an e x p e r i e n c e he is r e g a r d e d , as an A c h u m a u i medicine man put it, as " a n ordinary Indian, nobody."
T h e young man's dream came at the beginning of his life, and it pointed to his future independence and identity as a man. T h e woman I have described was approaching the end of her life, and she experienced a similar journey and seemed to need to acquire a similar independence. She could live out the remainder of her days in harmony with an eternal human law that, by its antiquity, transcended the known symbols of culture.
But such independence does not end in a state of yogi-like detachment that would mean a renunciation o f the world with all its impurities. In the otherwise dead and blasted landscape o f her d r e a m the w o m a n saw signs of animal life. These are "water pigs," unknown to her as a species. T h e y therefore would carry the meaning of a special type of animal, one that can live in two environments, in water or on the earth.
T h i s is the universal quality o f the a n i m a l as a symbol of transcendence. These creatures, figuratively coming from the depths of the ancient Earth Mother, are symbolic denizens of
the collective unconscious. They bring into the field of consciousness a special chthonic (underworld) message that is s o m e w h a t different from the spiritual aspirations symbolized by the birds in the young man's dream.
Other transcendent symbols of the depths are rodents, lizards, snakes, and sometimes fish. These are intermediate creatures that combine underwater activity and the bird-flight with an intermediate terrestrial life. T h e wild duck or the swan are cases in point. Perhaps the commonest d r e a m s y m b o l o f t r a n s c e n d e n c e is the snake, as represented by the therapeutic symbol of the R o m a n god of medicine Aesculapius, which has survived to modern times as a sign of the medical profession. This was originally a nonpoisonous tree snake; as we sec it, coiled around the staff o f the healing god, it seems to embody a kind of mediation between earth and heaven.
A still more important and widespread symbol o f c h t h o n i c t r a n s c e n d e n c e is the motif of the two entwined serpents. These are the famous Naga serpents of ancient India; and we also find them in Greece as the entwined serpents on the end of the staff belonging to the god H e r m e s . A n early G r e c i a n herm is a stone pillar with a bust of the god above. O n one side are the entwined serpents and on the other an erect phallus. As the serpents are represented

Left, a 17th-century French painting reveals the snake's role as mediator between this world and the next. Orpheus is p l a y i n g his lyre; he and his audience fail to notice that Eurydice (center of picture) has been bitten by a s n a k e — a fatal wound that symbolizes her descent into the underworld.
Above, the Egyptian god Thoth with the head of a bird (an ibis), in a relief f r o m c. 3 5 0 B.C. T h o t h is an "underworld" figure associated w i t h transcendence; it w a s he w h o judged the souls of the dead. The Greek god Hermes, w h o was called "psycho-pomp" (soul-guide), had the function of guiding the dead to the underworld. Left, a stone herm, w h i c h w a s p l a c e d at c r o s s roads (symbolizing the god's role as a mediator between t w o w o r l d s ) O n the side of the herm is a snake twined around a staff; this s y m b o l ( t h e caduceus) w a s c a r r i e d over to the Roman god Mercury (right, a 16th-century Italian bronze), w h o also acquired wings, recalling the bird as a symbol of spiritual transcendence.
'55



in the act of sexual union and the erect phallus is u n e q u i v o c a l l y s e x u a l , we c a n d r a w certain conclusions about the function of the herm as a symbol of fertility.
But we are mistaken if we think this only refers to biological fertility. H e r m e s is T r i c k s t e r in a different role as a messenger, a god of the cross-roads, and finally the leader of souls to and from the underworld. His phallus therefore penetrates from the known into the unknown world, seeking a spiritual message of deliverance and healing.
Originally in Egypt Hermes was known as the ibis-headed god Thoth, and therefore w a s conceived as the bird form of the transcendent principle. Again, in the Olympian period of Greek mythology, Hermes recovered attributes of the bird life to add to his chthonic nature as serpent. His staff acquired wings above the serp e n t s , b e c o m i n g t h e caduceus o r w i n g e d staff of Mercury, and the god himself became the "flying m a n " with his winged hat and sandals.
Here we see his full power of transcendence, whereby the lower transcendence from underworld snake-consciousness, passing through the medium of earthly reality, finally attains transcendence to superhuman or transpersonal reality in its winged flight.
S u c h a c o m p o s i t e s y m b o l is found in o t h e r representations as the winged horse or winged dragon or other creatures that a b o u n d in the artistic expressions of a l c h e m y , so fully illustrated in Dr. Jung's classic work on this subject. W e follow the innumerable vicissitudes of these symbols in our work with patients. T h e y show what our therapy can expect to achieve when it liberates the deeper psychic contents so that they can become part of our conscious equipment for understanding life more effectively.
It is not easy for m o d e r n m a n to grasp the significance of the symbols that come down to us from the past or that appear in our dreams. N o r is it easy to see how the a n c i e n t conflict between symbols ofcontainment and liberation
Winged dragons (above, from a 15thcentury manuscript) combine the transcendent symbolism of the snake and the bird. Right, an image of spiritual transcendence: Mohammed on the winged mare Buraq flies through the celestial spheres
156



relates to our own p r e d i c a m e n t . Y e t it becomes easier w h e n we realize it is only the specificforms of these archaic patterns that change, not their psychic meaning.
W e have been talking of wild birds as symbols of release or liberation. But today we could as well speak of j e t planes and space rockets, for they are the physical embodiment of the same transcendent principle, freeing us at least temporarily from gravity. In the same way the ancient symbols of containment, which once gave stability and protection, now appear in modern man's search for economic security and social welfare.
Any o f us c a n see, o f course, that there is a conflict in our lives between adventure and discipline, or evil and virtue, or freedom and security. But these are only phrases we use to describe an ambivalence that troubles us, and to w h i c h w e n e v e r s e e m a b l e to find a n a n s w e r .
T h e r e is an a n s w e r . T h e r e is a m e e t i n g point between containment and liberation, and we can find it in t h e rites o f i n i t i a t i o n t h a t I h a v e been discussing. T h e y c a n m a k e it possible for individuals, or whole groups of people, to unite the opposing forces within themselves and achieve an equilibrium in their lives.
But the rites do not offer this opportunity invariably, or automatically. T h e y relate to particular phases in the life of an individual, or of a group, and unless they are properly understood and translated into a new way oflife, the moment can pass. Initiation is, essentially, a process that begins with a rite of submission, followed by a period of containment, and then by a further rite of liberation. In this way every individual can reconcile the conflicting elements of his personality: He can strike a balance that makes him truly human, and truly the master of himself.
In the d r e a m s a n d f a n t a s i e s of m a n y modern people, the flights of the great rockets of space research have often appeared as symbolic 20th-century embodiments of the urge toward liberation and release that is called t r a n s c e n d e n c e .

The pattern of psychic growth
At the beginning of this book Dr. C. G. J u n g introduced the reader to the concept of the unconscious, its personal and collective structures, and its symbolic mode of expression. O n c e one has seen the vital importance (that is, the healing or destructive impact) of the symbols produced by the unconscious, there remains the difficult problem of interpretation. Dr. J u n g has shown that everything depends on whether any particular interpretation " c l i c k s " and is m e a n ingful to the individual concerned. In this way he has indicated the possible meaning and function of dream symbolism.
But, in the development of J u n g ' s theory, this possibility raised another question: What is the p u r p o s e o f t h e total d r e a m life o f t h e individual? What role do dreams play, not only in the immediate psychic e c o n o m y of the human being, but in his life as a whole?
By observing a great many people and studying their dreams (he estimated that he interpreted at least 80,000 dreams), J u n g discovered not only that all dreams are relevant in varying degrees to the life of the dreamer, but that they are all parts of one great web of psychological factors, fcle also f o u n d t h a t , on t h e w h o l e , t h e y seem to follow an arrangement or pattern. This pattern Jung called "the process of individuation." Since dreams produce different scenes and images every night, people who are not careful observers will probably be unaware of any pattern. But if one watches one's own dreams over a period of years and studies the entire sequence, one will see that certain contents emerge, disappear, and then turn up again. Many people even dream repeatedly of the same figures, landscapes, or situations; and if one follows these through a whole series, one will see that they change slowly but perceptibly. These changes can be accelerated if the dreamer's conscious a t t i t u d e is influenced by a p p r o priate interpretation of the dreams and their symbolic contents.
Below, a "meander" (a decoration in a seventh-century manuscript). Individual dreams seem as strange and fragmented as the detail, above, from the decoration; but over a lifetime's dreaming, a meandering pattern appears -revealing the process of psychic growth

The process of individuation



Thus our dream life creates a meandering pattern in which individual strands or tendencies become visible, then vanish, then return again. If one watches this meandering design over a long period of time, one can observe a sort of hidden regulating or directing tendency at work, creating a slow, imperceptible process of psychic growth the process of individuation.
Gradually a wider and more mature personality emerges, and by degrees becomes effective and even visible to others. T h e fact that we often speak of "arrested development" shows that we assume that such a process of growth and m a t u r a t i o n is possible with every individual. Since this psychic growth cannot be brought about by a conscious effort of will power, but happens involuntarily and naturally, it is in d r e a m s f r e q u e n t l y s y m b o l i z e d by the tree, whose slow, powerful, involuntarygrowth fulfills a definite pattern.
The organizing center from which the regulatory effect stems seems to be a sort of " n u clear a t o m " in our psychic system. O n e could also call it the i n v e n t o r , o r g a n i z e r , a n d source of dream images. J u n g called this center the " S e l f " a n d d e s c r i b e d it as the t o t a l i t y of the whole p s y c h e , in o r d e r to distinguish it from the " e g o , " which constitutes only a small part of the total psyche.
Throughout the ages men have been intuitively aware of the existence o f such an inner center. T h e G r e e k s c a l l e d it m a n ' s i n n e r daimon; in E g y p t it w a s e x p r e s s e d by t h e c o n c e p t of the Ba-soul; a n d t h e R o m a n s w o r s h i p e d it as the " g e n i u s " n a t i v e to e a c h i n d i v i d u a l . In more primitive societies it was often thought o f as a p r o t e c t i v e spirit e m b o d i e d w i t h i n a n animal or a fetish.
T h i s i n n e r c e n t e r is r e a l i z e d in e x c e p t i o n a l l y pure, unspoiled form by the Naskapi Indians, who still exist in the forests o f the L a b r a d o r peninsula. These simple people are hunters who live in isolated family g r o u p s , so far from o n e

another that they have not been able to evolve tribal customs or collective religious beliefs and ceremonies. In his lifelong solitude the Naskapi hunter has to rely on his own inner voices and unconscious revelations; he has no religious teachers who tell him what he should believe, no rituals, festivals, or customs to help him along. In his basic view oflife, the soul of man is s i m p l y a n " i n n e r c o m p a n i o n , " w h o m he calls " m y f r i e n d " o r Mista'peo, m e a n i n g " G r e a t M a n . " M i s t a ' p e o dwells in the h e a r t a n d is i m m o r t a l ; in the m o m e n t of d e a t h , or shortly before, he leaves the individual, and later reincarnates himself in another being. Those Naskapi who pay attention to their d r e a m s and w h o try to find their m e a n i n g and test their truth can enter into a deeper connection with the Great Man. He favors such people and sends them more and better dreams. Thus the major obligation of an individual N a s k a p i is to follow the i n s t r u c t i o n s g i v e n by his dreams, and then to give permanent form to their contents in art. Lies and dishonesty drive the ( b e a t Man away from one's inner realm, whereas generosity and love of one's

The psyche can he compared to a sphere w i t h a bright field (A) on its surface, representing consciousness T h e ego is t h e f i e l d ' s c e n t e r ( o n l y if " I " k n o w a t h i n g is it c o n s c i o u s ) T h e Self is at o n c e t h e n u c l e u s and the w h o l e sphere ( B ) ; its internal regulating processes produce dreams



him life. Dreams give the Naskapi complete ability to find his way in life, not only in the inner world but also in the outer world of nature. They help him to foretell the weather and give him invaluable guidance in his hunting, upon which his life depends. I mention these very primitive people because they are uncontaminated by our civilized ideas and still have natural insight into the essence of what J u n g calls the Self.
T h e Self can be defined as an inner guiding factor that is different from the conscious personality and that can be grasped only through the investigation of one's own dreams. These show it to be the regulating center that brings about a constant extension and maturing of the personality. But this larger, more nearly total aspect of the psyche appears first as merely an inborn possibility. It may emerge very slightly, or it may develop relatively completely during one's lifetime. How far it develops depends on w h e t h e r or not the ego is willing to listen to the messages of the Self. J u s t as the Naskapi have noticed that a person w h o is receptive to the hints of the Great M a n gets better and more helpful dreams, we could add that the inborn Great M a n becomes more real within the receptive person than in those who neglect him. Such a person also becomes a more complete human being.
It even seems as if the ego has not been produced by nature to follow its own arbitrary impulses to an unlimited extent, but to help to m a k e real the totality — the w h o l e psyche. It is the ego that serves to light up the entire system, allowing it to become conscious and thus to be realized. If, for example, I have an artistic talent o f w h i c h my ego is not conscious, n o t h i n g will happen to it. T h e gift may as well be nonexistent. Only if my ego notices it can T bring it into reality. T h e inborn but hidden totality o f the psyche is not the s a m e t h i n g as a w h o l e ness that is fully realized a n d lived.
One could picture this in the following way: T h e seed of a mountain pine contains the whole future tree in a latent form; but each seed falls at a certain time onto a particular place, in which there are a n u m b e r of special
factors, such as the quality of the soil and the stones, the slope of the land, and its exposure to sun and wind. T h e latent totality of the pine in the seed reacts to these circumstances by avoiding the stones and inclining toward the s u n , w i t h t h e result t h a t t h e t r e e ' s g r o w t h is shaped. Thus an individual pine slowly comes into existence, constituting the fulfillment of its totality, its emergence into the realm of reality. W i t h o u t t h e living t r e e , t h e i m a g e o f t h e p i n e is only a possibility or an abstract idea. Again, the realization of this uniqueness in the individual m a n is the goal o f the process o f i n d i v i d u a t i o n .
From one point of view this process takes place in m a n (as well as in every other living being) by itself a n d in the u n c o n s c i o u s ; it is a process by which man lives out his innate human nature. Strictly speaking, however, the process o f i n d i v i d u a t i o n is real only if the individual is a w a r e o f it a n d c o n s e q u e n t l y m a k e s a living connection with it. W e do not know w h e t h e r the p i n e tree is a w a r e o f its own growth, whether it enjoys and suffers the different vicissitudes that shape it. But man certainly is a b l e to p a r t i c i p a t e consciously in his development. He even feels that from time to time, by making free decisions, he can cooperate actively with it. This co-operation belongs to the process of individuation in the narrower sense of the word.
Man, however, experiences something that is not c o n t a i n e d in o u r m e t a p h o r o f the pine tree. T h e i n d i v i d u a t i o n process is m o r e t h a n a coming to terms between the inborn germ of wholeness and the outer acts of fate. Its subjective experience conveys the feeling that some supra-personal force is actively interfering in a creative way. O n e sometimes feels that the unconscious is leading the way in a c c o r d a n c e with a secret design. It is as i f s o m e t h i n g is looking at me, something that I do not see but that sees me — perhaps that Great M a n in the heart, who tells me his opinions about me by means of dreams.
But this creatively active aspect of the psychic nucleus can come into play only when the ego gets rid of all purposive and wishful aims and tries to get to a deeper, more basic form
162



of existence. T h e ego must be able to listen attentively and to give itself, without any further design or purpose, to that inner urge toward growth. M a n y existentialist philosophers try to d e s c r i b e this s t a t e , b u t t h e y go o n l y as far as stripping o f f the illusions o f consciousness: T h e y go right up to the door of the unconscious and then fail to open it.
People living in cultures more securely rooted than our own have less trouble in understanding that it is n e c e s s a r y to give up the u t i l i t a r i a n attitude of conscious planning in order to make way for the i n n e r g r o w t h o f the personality. I once met an elderly lady who had not achieved much in her life, in terms of outward achievement. But she had in fact made a good marriage with a difficult h u s b a n d , and had somehow developed i n t o a m a t u r e p e r s o n a l i t y . W h e n she c o m p l a i n e d to m e t h a t she h a d not " d o n e " anything in her life, I told her a story related by a C h i n e s e s a g e , C h u a n g - T z u . S h e u n d e r stood i m m e d i a t e l y a n d felt great relief. T h i s is the story:
A wandering carpenter, called Stone, saw on his travels a gigantic old oak tree standing in a field near an earth-altar. T h e carpenter said to his apprentice, who was admiring the o a k : " T h i s is
a useless tree. II you wanted to make a ship, it would soon rot; if you wanted to make tools, they would break. You can't do anything useful with this tree, and that's why it has become so o l d . " But in an inn, that same evening, when the carpenter went to sleep, the old oak tree appeared to him in his dream and said: " W h y do you compare me to your cultivated trees such as whitethorn, pear, orange, and apple trees, and all the others that bear fruit? Even before they can ripen their fruit, people attack and violate them. Their branches are broken, their twigs are torn. Their own gifts bring harm to them, and they cannot live out their natural span. T h a t is what happens everywhere, and that is why I have long since tried to become completely useless. You poor mortal! Imagine if I had been useful in any way, would I have reached this size? Furthermore, you and I are both creatures, and how can one creature set himself so high as to judge another creature? You useless mortal man, what do you know about useless trees?" T h e carpenter woke up and meditated upon his dream, and later, when his apprentice asked him why just this one tree served to protect the earthaltar, he answered, " K e e p your mouth shut! Let's hear no more about it! T h e tree grew here on purpose because anywhere else people would have ill-treated it. I f it were not the tree of the earthaltar, it might have been chopped d o w n . "
T h e carpenter obviously understood his dream. He saw that simply to fulfill one's destiny is the greatest h u m a n a c h i e v e m e n t , a n d that our utilitarian notions have to give way in the face of the demands of our unconscious psyche; If we translate this metaphor into psychological language, the tree symbolizes the process of i n d i v i d u a t i o n , giving a lesson to our shortsighted ego.
U n d e r the tree that fulfilled its destiny, there was—in Chuang-Tzu's story —an earth-altar. This was a crude, unwrought stone upon which people made sacrifices to the local god who " o w n e d " this piece of land. T h e symbol of the earth-altar points to the fact that in order to bring the individuation process into reality, one must surrender consciously to the power of the unconscious, instead of thinking in terms of w h a t o n e should d o , or o f w h a t is g e n e r a l l y thought right, or of what usually happens. One must simply listen, in order to learn what the

inner totality the Self wants one to do here and now in a particular situation.
O u r a t t i t u d e must be like that of the m o u n tain pine mentioned a b o v e : It does not get a n n o y e d w h e n its g r o w t h is o b s t r u c t e d by a stone, nor does it make plans about how to overcome the obstacles. It merely tries to feel w h e t h e r it should grow m o r e toward the left or the right, toward the slope or away from it. Like the tree, we should give in to this almost imperceptible, yet powerfully dominating, impulse an impulse that comes from the urge toward unique, creative self-realization. And this is a process in w h i c h o n e must r e p e a t e d l y seek out a n d find s o m e t h i n g that is not yet k n o w n to anyone. T h e guiding hints or impulses come, not from the ego, but from the totality of the psyche: the Self.
It is, moreover, useless to cast furtive glances at the w a y s o m e o n e else is d e v e l o p i n g , b e c a u s e e a c h o f us has a u n i q u e task of self-realization. Although many human problems are similar, they are never identical. All pine trees are very much alike (otherwise we should not recognize t h e m as p i n e s ) , yet n o n e is e x a c t l y the s a m e as another. Because of these factors of sameness a n d d i f f e r e n c e , it is difficult to s u m m a r i z e the infinite variations of the process of individua
tion. The fact is that e a c h person has to do s o m e t h i n g d i f f e r e n t , s o m e t h i n g that is u n i q u e l y his own.
Many people have criticized the Jungian approach for not presenting psychic material systematically. But these critics forget that the m a t e r i a l itself is a living e x p e r i e n c e c h a r g e d with emotion, by nature irrational and everchanging, which does not lend itself to systematization except in the most superficial fashion. Modern depth psychology has here reached the same limits that confront microphysics. T h a t is, when w e are dealing with statistical averages, a rational and systematic description of the facts is possible. But w h e n we a r e a t t e m p t i n g to d e scribe a single psychic event, we can do no more t h a n present an honest p i c t u r e of it f r o m as many angles as possible. I n the same way, scientists have to admit that they do not know what light is. They can say only that in certain exp e r i m e n t a l conditions it seems to consist o f particles, while in other e x p e r i m e n t a l conditions it s e e m s to consist o f w a v e s . B u t w h a t it is " i n i t s e l f " is not k n o w n . T h e p s y c h o l o g y of the unconscious and any description of the process of individuation encounter comparable difficulties of definition. But I will try here to give a sketch of some of their most typical features.



The first approach of the unconscious
For most people the years of youth are characterized by a state of gradual awakening in which the individual slowly becomes aware o f the world and o f himself. C h i l d h o o d is a period of great emotional intensity, and a child's earliest dreams often manifest in symbolic form the basic structure o f the psyche, i n d i c a t i n g how it will l a t e r s h a p e the d e s t i n y o f the i n d i v i d u a l concerned. For example, J ting once told a group of students about a young w o m a n who was so haunted by anxiety that she committed suicide at the age o f 26. As a small c h i l d , she had dreamed that "Jack Frost" had entered her room while she was lyiilg in bed and pinched her on the s t o m a c h . S h e woke a n d discovered that she had pinched herself with her own hand. The dream did not frighten her; she merely remembered that she had bad such a d r e a m . Hut the fact that she did not react emotionally to her strange e n c o u n t e r with the d e m o n of the cold of congealed life did not a u g u r well for the future and was itself a b n o r m a l . It was with a cold, unfeeling hand that she later put an end
to her life. F r o m this single d r e a m it is possible to deduce the tragic fate of the dreamer, which was anticipated by her psyche in childhood. S o m e t i m e s it is not a d r e a m but s o m e very impressive and unforgettable real event that, like a prophecy, anticipates the future in symbolic f o r m . It is well k n o w n t h a t c h i l d r e n often forget events that seem impressive to adults but keep a vivid r e c o l l e c t i o n of s o m e i n c i d e n t o r story that no one else has noticed. When we look into one of these childhood memories, we usually find t h a t it d e p i c t s (if i n t e r p r e t e d as if it were a symbol) a basic problem o f the child's psychic makeup.
When a child reaches school age, the phase o f b u i l d i n g up the ego a n d of a d a p t i n g to the outer world begins. This phase generally brings a number of painful shocks. At the same time, some children begin to feel very different from others, and this feeling of being u n i q u e brings a c e r t a i n sadness t h a t is p a r t o f the loneliness of many youngsters. The imperfections of the world, and the evil within oneself as well as out
A child, adapting to the outside world, receives many psychological shocks: far left, the fearful first day at school; center, the surprise and pain resulting from an attack by another child, left, the grief and bewilderment of the first experience of death As in effect a protection from such shocks, the child may dream or draw a circular, quadrangular, nuclear motif (above) that symbolizes the all important center of the psyche

side, become conscious problems; thechild must try to cope with urgent (but not yet understood) inner impulses as well as the demands of the outer world.
I f t h e d e v e l o p m e n t o f c o n s c i o u s n e s s is disturbed in its normal unfolding, children frequently retire from outer or inner difficulties into an inner "fortress"; and when that happens, their d r e a m s a n d symbolic drawings of unconscious material often reveal to an unusual degree a type of circular, quadrangular, and " n u c l e a r " motif (which I will explain later). This refers to the previously mentioned psychic nucleus, the vital c e n t e r of the personality from which t h e w h o l e s t r u c t u r a l d e v e l o p m e n t of c o n sciousness s t e m s . It is n a t u r a l t h a t t h e i m a g e o f
the ( C i l l e r s h o u l d a p p e a r in an especially striking way when the psychic life o f the individual is t h r e a t e n e d . F r o m this c e n t r a l n u c l e u s (as f a r as we know today), the whole building up of ego c o n s c i o u s n e s s is d i r e c t e d , t h e e g o a p p a r e n t l y b e ing a duplicate or structural counterpart ol the original center.
In this early phase there are many children who earnestly seek for some meaning in life that could help them to deal with the chaos both within andoutside themselves. There are others, however, who are still unconsciously carried
a l o n g by t h e d y n a m i s m o f i n h e r i t e d a n d i n s t i n c tive archetypal pat terns. These young people are not concerned about the deeper meaning oflife, because their experiences with love, nature, sport, and work contain an immediate and satisfying meaning forthem. They are not necessarily more superficial; usually they are carried by the stream of life with less friction a n d disturbance than their more introspective fellows. If I travel in a c a r or train without looking out, it is only t h e stops, starts, a n d s u d d e n turns t h a t make me realise I am moving at all.
T h e actual process of individuation the conscious coming-to-terms with one's own inner center (psychic nucleus) or Self—generally begins with a wounding of the personality and the suffering that accompanies it. This initial shock a m o u n t s to a sort o f " c a l l , " a l t h o u g h it is not often recognized as such. O n the contrary, the ego feels h a m p e r e d in its will or its desire a n d usually projects the obstruction onto something e x t e r n a l . T h a t is. t h e e g o a c c u s e s G o d o r Uneconomic situation or the boss or the marriagep a r t n e r o f b e i n g responsible for w h a t e v e r is obstructing it.
O r perhaps everything seems outwardly all r i g h t , b u t b e n e a t h t h e s u r f a c e a person is suffering from a deadly boredom that makes every
166



thing seem meaningless and empty. M a n y myths and fairy tales symbolically describe this initial stage in the process of individuation by telling of a king who has fallen ill or grown old. Other familiar story patterns are that a royal couple is b a r r e n ; o r t h a t a m o n s t e r steals all t h e women, children, horses, and wealth of the kingdom; or that a demon keeps the king's army or his ship from p r o c e e d i n g on its c o u r s e ; or that darkness hangs over the lands, wells dry up, and flood, drought, a n d frost afflict the country. T h u s it seems as if the initial encounter with the S e l f casts a d a r k s h a d o w a h e a d o f time, or as if the " i n n e r friend" comes at first like a t r a p p e r to c a t c h the helplessly struggling ego in his snare.
In myths one finds that the magic or talisman that can cure the misfortune o f the king or his country always proves to be something very special. In one tale " a white blackbird"' or " a fish that c a r r i e s a g o l d e n r i n g in its gills'" is needed to restore the king's health. In another, the king w a n t s " t h e w a t e r o f life'" or " t h r e e golden hairs from the head of the devil" or " a woman's golden plait" (and afterward, naturally, the owner o f the plait). W h a t e v e r it is, the thing that c a n drive a w a y the evil is always unique a n d h a r d to find.
It is e x a c t l y t h e s a m e in t h e i n i t i a l crisis in the life o f an individual. O n e is seeking s o m e t h i n g t h a t is i m p o s s i b l e to find o r a b o u t w h i c h n o t h i n g is k n o w n .

None of that helps, or at best only rarely. T h e r e is only one thing that seems to w o r k ; a n d that is to turn directly toward the approaching darkness without prej u d i c e a n d t o t a l l y n a i v e l y , a n d to try to find out what its secret aim is and what it wants from you.
The hidden purpose of the oncoming darkness is g e n e r a l l y s o m e t h i n g so unusual, so u n i q u e a n d u n e x p e c t e d , t h a t as a r u l e o n e c a n find o u t w h a t it is o n l y b y m e a n s o f d r e a m s a n d f a n t a sies welling up from the unconscious.

The realization of the shadow
W h e t h e r t h e u n c o n s c i o u s c o m e s up at first in a helpful or a negative form, after a time the need usually arises to readapt the conscious a t t i t u d e in a b e t t e r way to the u n c o n s c i o u s factors therefore to accept what seems to be "criticism" from the unconscious. Through d r e a m s o n e b e c o m e s a c q u a i n t e d with aspects of one's own personality that for various reasons one has preferred not to look at too closely. This is w h a t J u n g c a l l e d " t h e r e a l i z a t i o n of the shadow." (He used the term " s h a d o w " for this unconscious part of the personality because it actually often appears in dreams in a personified f o r m . )
T h e s h a d o w is not the whole o f the u n c o n scious personality. It represents unknown or l i t t l e - k n o w n a t t r i b u t e s a n d q u a l i t i e s of the ego — aspects that mostly belong to the personal sphere and that could just as well be conscious. In some aspects, the shadow can also consist of collective factors that stem from a source outside the individual's personal life.
When an individual makes an attempt to see his s h a d o w , he b e c o m e s a w a r e of (and often ashamed o f those qualities and impulses he denies in himself but c a n plainly see in other
people such things as egotism, mental laziness, and sloppiness; unreal fantasies, schemes, and plots; carelessness and cowardice; inordinate love o f m o n e y a n d possessions in s h o r t , all Unlit tie sins about which he might previously have told himself: " T h a t doesn't matter; nobody will notice it, and in any case other people do it t o o . "
If you feel an overwhelming rage coming up in you when a friend reproaches you about a fault, you can be fairly sure that at this point you will find a part of your shadow, of which you a r e u n c o n s c i o u s . It is, of c o u r s e , n a t u r a l to become annoyed when others who are "no better" criticize you because of shadow faults. But what can you say if your own dreams — an inner judge in your own b e i n g r e p r o a c h y o u ? T h a t is t h e m o m e n t w h e n t h e e g o gets c a u g h t , a n d the result is usually e m b a r r a s s e d silence. Afterward the painful and lengthy work of self-educ a t i o n b e g i n s a w o r k , we m i g h t say, that is the psychological equivalent of the labors of H e r c u l e s . T h i s u n f o r t u n a t e h e r o ' s first task, you will remember, was to clean up in one day the A u g e a n S t a b l e s , in w h i c h h u n d r e d s of c a t t l e had d i o p p r d theii dung for m a i n d e c a d e s a task

so e n o r m o u s that the o r d i n a r y m o r t a l w o u l d b e overcome by discouragement at the mere thought of it.
The shadow does not consist only of omissions. It shows up just as often in an impulsive or inadvertent a c t . B e f o r e o n e has t i m e to t h i n k , the evil r e m a r k pops out, the plot is h a t c h e d , the wrong decision is m a d e , a n d o n e is c o n fronted with results that were never intended or consciously w a n t e d . F u r t h e r m o r e , the shadow is e x p o s e d to c o l l e c t i v e i n f e c t i o n s to a m u c h greater extent than is the conscious personality. When a m a n is a l o n e , for i n s t a n c e , he feels r e l a tively all r i g h t ; but as soon as " t h e o t h e r s " do dark, primitive things, he begins to fear that if he doesn't j o i n in, he will b e c o n s i d e r e d a fool. Thus he gives way to impulses that do not really belong to him at all. It is p a r t i c u l a r l y in c o n tacts with people of the same sex that one stumbles over both one's own shadow and those of other people. A l t h o u g h we do see the shadow in a person o f the o p p o s i t e sex, w e a r e usually much less annoyed by it and c a n more easily pardon it.
In dreams and myths, therefore, the shadow appeals as a person of the same sex as that of
the dreamer. T h e following dream may serve as an example. T h e dreamer was a man of 48 who tried to live very much for and bv himself, working hard and disciplining himself, repressing pleasure and spontaneity to a far greater extent than suited his real nature.
1 owned and inhabited a very big house in town, and I didn't yet know all its different parts. So I took a walk through it and discovered, mainly in the cellar, several rooms about which I knew nothing and even exits leading into other cellars or into subterranean streets. I felt uneasy when I found that several of these exits were not locked and some had no locks at all. Moreover, there were some laborers at work in the neighborhood who could have sneaked in. . . . When I came up again to the ground floor, I passed a back yard where again I discovered dilferent exits into the street or into other houses. When I tried to investigate them m o t e closely, a man came up to me laughing loudly and calling out that we were old pa Is from the elementary school. I remembered him too, and while he was telling me about his life, I walked along with him toward the exit and strolled with him through the streets. T h e r e was a strange chiaroscuro in the air as we walked through an enormous circular street



and arrived at a green lawn where three galloping horses suddenly passed us. They were beautiful, strong animals, wild but well-groomed, and they had no rider with them. (Had they run away from military service?)
The maze of strange passages, chambers, and unlocked exits in the cellar recalls the old Egyptian representation of the underworld, which is a w e l l - k n o w n s y m b o l o f the u n c o n scious with its unknown possibilities. It also shows how o n e is " o p e n " to other influences in one's unconscious shadow side, and how uncanny and alien elements can break in. T h e cellar, o n e c a n say, is the b a s e m e n t o f the dreamer's psyche. In the back yard of the strange building (which represents the still unperceived psychic scope of the dreamer's personality) an old school friend suddenly turns up. This person obviously personifies another aspect of the dreamer himself—an aspect that had been part of his life as a child but that he had forgotten and lost. It often happens that a person's childhood qualities (for instance, gaiety, irascibility, or perhaps trustfulness) suddenly
disappear, and one does not know where or how they h a v e g o n e . It is such a lost c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of the dreamer that now returns (from the back yard) and tries to make friends again. This figure probably stands for the dreamer's neglected capacity for enjoying life and for his extraverted shadow side.
But we soon learn why the dreamer feels " u n easy "just before meeting this seemingly harmless old friend. W h e n he strolls with him in the street, the horses break loose. T h e dreamer thinks they may have escaped from military service ( t h a t is to say, from the conscious discipline that has hitherto characterized his life). The fact that the horses have no rider shows that instinctive drives can get away from conscious control. In this old friend, and in the horses, all the positive force reappears that was lacking before and that was badly needed by the dreamer.
T h i s is a p r o b l e m that often c o m e s up when one meets one's "other side." T h e shadow usually contains values that are needed by consciousness, but that exist in a form that makes it

Left, Anxious Journey by t h e m o d e r n Italian artist de Chirico. The title and gloomy passages of the painting express the nature of the first contact with the unconscious when the individuation process begins. The u n c o n s c i o u s is often symbolized by corridors, labyrinths, or mazes: Right, on a papyrus (c, 1400 B.C.), the seven doors of the Egyptian underworld, itself seen as a maze. Below, drawings of three mazes: left to right, a Finnish stone maze (Bronze Age): a 19th century British turf maze: and a maze (in tiles) o n the floor of Chartres Cathedral (it could be w a l k e d as a symbolic pilgrimage to the Holy Land).
difficult to integrate t h e m into one's life. T h e passages and the large house in this d r e a m also show that the d r e a m e r does not yet know his own p s y c h i c d i m e n s i o n s a n d is n o t yet a b l e t o fill t h e m o u t .
T h e s h a d o w in this d r e a m is t y p i c a l for a n introvert fa m a n w h o t e n d s to retire too m u c h from outer life). In the case of an cxtravert, w h o is t u r n e d m o r e t o w a r d o u t e r o b j e c t s a n d o u t e r life, t h e s h a d o w w o u l d look q u i t e different. A young m a n who had a very lively temperament embarked again and again on successful enterprises, while at the same time his dreams i n s i s t e d t h a t h e s h o u l d finish off a p i e c e o f p r i vate creative work he had begun. T h e following was one of those d r e a m s :
A m a n is lying o n a c o u c h a n d h a s p u l l e d t h e cover o v e r his face. H e is a F r e n c h m a n , a d e s perado who would take on any criminal job. An official is a c c o m p a n y i n g m e d o w n s t a i r s , a n d I know that a plot has been made against m e : namely, that the F r e n c h m a n should kill me as if by c h a n c e . ( T h a t is h o w it w o u l d look from t h e outside.) He actually sneaks up behind me when
we approach the exit, but I am on my guard. A tall, portly man (rather rich and influential) suddenly leans against the wall beside me, feeling ill. I quickly g r a b the o p p o r t u n i t y to kill the official by stabbing his heart. " O n e only notices a bit of m o i s t u r e " — t h i s is said like a c o m m e n t . N o w I a m safe, for the F r e n c h m a n won't attack me since the m a n w h o g a v e him his orders is d e a d . ( P r o b ably the official and the successful portly man are the same person, the latter somehow replacing the former.)
T h e desperado represents the other side of the dreamer—his introversion —which has reached a completely destitute state. H e lies on a c o u c h (i.e. he is passive) a n d pulls t h e c o v e r o v e r his face b e c a u s e h e w a n t s to be left a l o n e . T h e official, on the other hand, and the prosperous portly man (who are secretly the same person ) personify the dreamer's successful outer responsibilities and activities. T h e sudden illness of t h e p o r t l y m a n is c o n n e c t e d w i t h t h e fact t h a t this d r e a m e r h a d in fact b e c o m e ill several times when he had allowed his d y n a m i c energy to explode too forcibly in his external life. But this

successful m a n has no blood in his veins only a sort of moisture which means that these ext e r n a l a m b i t i o u s a c t i v i t i e s of t h e d r e a m e r c o n tain n o g e n u i n e life a n d n o passion, b u t a r e bloodless m e c h a n i s m s . T h u s it w o u l d be n o real loss if t h e p o r t l y m a n w e r e k i l l e d . A t t h e e n d of t h e d r e a m , t h e F r e n c h m a n is satisfied; h e o b v i ously represents a positive shadow figure who had turned negative and dangerous only bec a u s e t h e c o n s c i o u s a t t i t u d e of t h e d r e a m e r d i d not agree with him.
This d r e a m shows us that the shadow can c o n s i s t of m a n y d i f f e r e n t e l e m e n t s for i n s t a n c e , of u n c o n s c i o u s a m b i t i o n ( t h e s u c c e s s f u l portly man) and of introversion (the Frenchman). This particular dreamer's association to the French, moreover, was that they know how to handle love affairs very well. Therefore the two shadow figures also represent two wellknown drives: power and sex. T h e power drive appears momentarily in a double form, both as an official a n d as a successful m a n . T h e official, or civil servant, personifies collective a d a p t a tion, whereas the successful man denotes ambition ; but naturally both serve the power drive. W h e n the d r e a m e r succeeds in stopping this d a n g e r o u s i n n e r force, t h e F r e n c h m a n is s u d denly no longer hostile. In other words, the e q u a l l y d a n g e r o u s a s p e c t of t h e sex d r i v e h a s also surrendered.
Obviously, the problem of the shadow plays a g r e a t r o l e i n all p o l i t i c a l c o n f l i c t s . If t h e m a n who had this dream had not been sensible about his shadow problem, he could easily have identified the desperate F r e n c h m a n with the " d a n g e r o u s C o m m u n i s t s ' ' of o u t e r life, o r t h e official plus the prosperous man with the "grasping capitalists." In this way he would have avoided seeing that he had within him such warring elements. If people observe their o w n u n c o n scious t e n d e n c i e s in o t h e r p e o p l e , this is c a l l e d a "projection." Political agitation in all countries is full of s u c h p r o j e c t i o n s , just as m u c h as the back-yard gossip of little groups and individuals. Projections of all kinds obscure our view of o u r fellow m e n , spoiling its objectivity, and thus spoiling all possibility of genuine human relationships.

"For over live years this man has been chasing around Europe like a madman in search of something he could set on lire. Untoitunalely he again and again finds hirelings who open the gates ol their country to this international incendiaiy "



A n d t h e r e is a n a d d i t i o n a l d i s a d v a n t a g e in projecting our shadow. If we identify our own shadow with, say, the Communists or the capitalists, a part of o u r o w n personality remains on the o p p o s i n g side. T h e result is t h a t w e shall constantly (though involuntarily) do things hehind our own backs that support this other side, and thus we shall unwittingly help our enemy. If, o n t h e c o n t r a r y , w e r e a l i z e t h e p r o j e c t i o n a n d can discuss matters without fear or hostility, dealing with the other person sensibly, then there is a c h a n c e of m u t u a l u n d e r s t a n d i n g o r at least of a truce.
Whether the shadow becomes our friend or enemy depends largely upon ourselves. As the dreams of the unexplored house and the French d e s p e r a d o b o t h s h o w , t h e s h a d o w is n o t n e c e s sarily a l w a y s a n o p p o n e n t . In fact, h e is e x a c t l y like a n y h u m a n b e i n g with w h o m o n e has to get along, sometimes by giving in, sometimes by resisting, sometimes by giving love whatever the situation requires. T h e shadow becomes hostile only w h e n h e is i g n o r e d o r m i s u n d e r s t o o d .
Sometimes, though not often, an individual feels i m p e l l e d to live o u t t h e w o r s e side of his nature and to repress his better side. In such cases t h e s h a d o w a p p e a r s a s a p o s i t i v e figure i n his d r e a m s . But to a person w h o lives out his natural emotions and feelings, the shadow may a p p e a r as a cold a n d n e g a t i v e i n t e l l e c t u a l ; it then personifies poisonous judgments and negative thoughts that have been held back. So, w h a t e v e r form it takes, t h e function of the s h a d o w is to r e p r e s e n t t h e o p p o s i t e side of t h e ego and to e m b o d y just those qualities that one dislikes most in other people.
It w o u l d be relatively easy if o n e c o u l d integrate the shadow into the conscious personality just by attempting to be honest and to use one's insight. But, unfortunately, such an attempt d o e s n o t a l w a y s w o r k . T h e r e is s u c h a p a s s i o n a t e drive within the shadowy part of oneself that reason m a y not prevail against it. A bitter experience coming from the outside may occasionally help; a brick, so to speak, has to d r o p on one's head to put a stop to shadow drives and impulses. At times a heroic decision may serve to halt them, but such a superhuman e f f o r t is u s u a l l y p o s s i b l e o n l y if t h e C r e a t M a n within (the Self) helps the individual to carry it t h r o u g h .
T h e fact that the shadow contains the overw h e l m i n g power of irresistible impulse does not mean, however, that the drive should always be h e r o i c a l l y r e p r e s s e d . S o m e t i m e s t h e s h a d o w is p o w e r f u l b e c a u s e t h e u r g e of t h e Self is p o i n t ing in the same direction, and so one does not k n o w w h e t h e r it is t h e Self or t h e s h a d o w t h a t is b e h i n d t h e i n n e r p r e s s u r e . I n t h e u n c o n s c i o u s , o n e is u n f o r t u n a t e l y in t h e s a m e s i t u a t i o n as in a moonlit landscape: All the contents arc blurred and merge into one another, and one never knows exactly what or where anything is, o r w h e r e o n e t h i n g b e g i n s a n d e n d s . ( T h i s is known as the " c o n t a m i n a t i o n " of unconscious contents.)
W h e n J u n g called one aspect of the unconscious personality the shadow, he was referring to a relatively well-defined factor. But somet i m e s e v e r y t h i n g t h a t is u n k n o w n to t h e e g o is mixed up with the shadow, including even the most v a l u a b l e a n d highest forces. W h o , for in

Above, the wild white stallion from t h e 1 9 5 3 F r e n c h f i l m Crin Blanc Wild horses often symbolize the uncontrollable instinctive drives that can erupt from the unconscious — and that many people try to repress. In the film, the horse and a boy form a strong attachment (though the horse still runs wild with his herd). But local horsemen set out to capture the wild horses. The stallion and his boy rider are pursued for miles; finally they are cornered on the seashore. Rather than submit to capture, the boy and the horse plunge into the sea to be swept away Symbolically, the story's end seems to represent an escape into the unconscious (the sea) as a way to avoid facing reality in the outside w o r l d .



stance, could be quite sure whether the French desperado in the d r e a m I quoted was a useless tramp or a most valuable introvert? And the bolting horses of the preceding d r e a m — should they be allowed to run free or not? In a case when the d r e a m itself does not make things clear, the conscious personality will have to make the decision.
If the shadow figure contains valuable, vital forces, they ought to be assimilated into actual e x p e r i e n c e a n d n o t r e p r e s s e d . It is u p to t h e e g o to give u p its pride a n d priggishness a n d to live out something that seems to be dark, but actually m a y not be. T h i s can require a sacrifice just as heroic as the conquest of passion, but in a n o p p o s i t e sense.
T h e ethical difficulties that arise when one meets one's shadow are well described in the 18th Book of the K o r a n . In this tale Moses meets Khidr ("the Green O n e " or "first angel of G o d " ) in t h e d e s e r t . T h e y w a n d e r a l o n g t o gether, and K h i d r expresses his fear that Moses will not be a b l e to witness his d e e d s w i t h o u t indignation. If Moses cannot bear with him a n d trust him, K h i d r will have to leave.
P r e s e n t l y K h i d r s c u t t l e s t h e fishing b o a t o f some poor villagers. Then, before Moses's eyes, he kills a h a n d s o m e y o u n g m a n , a n d finally h e restores the fallen wall of a city of unbelievers. Moses cannot help expressing his indignation, and so K h i d r has to leave h i m . Before his d e parture, however, he explains the reasons for his a c t i o n s : By scuttling the b o a t he a c t u
ally saved it for its owners because pirates w e r e o n t h e i r w a y t o s t e a l it. A s it is, t h e fisherm e n can salvage it. T h e h a n d s o m e young m a n was on his way to c o m m i t a crime, and by killing him Khidr saved his pious parents from infamy. By restoring the wall, two pious young men were saved from ruin because their treasure was buried u n d e r it. Moses, w h o h a d been so morally indignant, saw now (too late) that his j u d g m e n t had been too hasty. Khidr's doings had seemed to be totally evil, but in fact they were not.
Looking at this story naively, one might a s s u m e t h a t K h i d r is t h e lawless, c a p r i c i o u s , evil shadow of pious, law-abiding Moses. But this is n o t t h e c a s e . K h i d r is m u c h m o r e t h e p e r sonification of some secret creative actions of t h e G o d h e a d . ( O n e c a n find a s i m i l a r m e a n i n g in the famous Indian story of " T h e K i n g and the Corpse" as interpreted by Henry Zimmer.) It is n o a c c i d e n t t h a t I h a v e n o t q u o t e d a d r e a m to illustrate this subtle problem. I have chosen this well-known story from the Koran because it sums u p the experience of a lifetime, which would very rarely be expressed with such clarity in an individual d r e a m .
W h e n d a r k figures t u r n u p i n o u r d r e a m s a n d seem to want something, we cannot be sure whether they personify merely a shadowy part of ourselves, or the Self, or b o t h at the s a m e time. Divining in advance whether our dark partner symbolizes a shortcoming that we should o v e r c o m e or a m e a n i n g f u l bit of life t h a t w e
The shadow can be said to have t w o aspects, one dangerous, the other valuable The painting of the Hindu god Vishnu, far left, images such a duality: Usually considered a benevolent god, Vishnu here appears in a demonic aspect, tearing a man apart Left, from a Japanese temple ( A D 759), a sculpture of Buddha also expresses duality: The god's many arms hold symbols of both good and evil Right, the doubt-stricken Martin Luther (portrayed by Albert Finney in the 1 9 6 1 p l a y Luther by B r i t a i n ' s J o h n Osborne): Luther was never sure whether his break from the Church was inspired by God or arose from his o w n pride and obstinacy (in symbolic terms, the "evil" side of his shadow).



s h o u l d a c c e p t this is o n e of the most difficult problems that we encounter on the way to individuation. Moreover, the dream symbols are often so subtle and complicated that one cannot be sure of their interpretation. In such a s i t u a t i o n all o n e c a n d o is a c c e p t t h e d i s c o m fort o f e t h i c a l d o u b t — m a k i n g n o final d e c i s i o n s or commitments and continuing to watch the dreams. This resembles the situation of Cinderella when her stepmother threw a heap of good and bad peas in front of her and asked her to sort t h e m out. A l t h o u g h it seemed quite h o p e less, Cinderella began patiently to sort the peas, and suddenly doves (or ants, in some versions) came to help her. These creatures symbolize helpful, deeply unconscious impulses that can only be felt in one's b o d y , as it were, a n d that point to a way out.
Somewhere, right at the bottom of one's own being, one generally does know where one should go and what one should do. But there are times when the clown we call " I " behaves in such a distracting fashion that the inner voice c a n n o t m a k e its presence felt. Sometimes all attempts to understand the hints of the unconscious fail, a n d in such a difficulty one can only have the courage to do what seems to be right, while being ready to c h a n g e course if the suggestions of the u n c o n scious should suddenly point in another direction. It m a y also h a p p e n ( a l t h o u g h this is u n u s u a l ) t h a t a p e r s o n w i l l find it b e t t e r t o resist the urge of the unconscious, even at the price of feeling warped by doing so, rather than d e p a r t too far from the state of being h u m a n . (This would be the situation of people who had to live out a criminal disposition in order tf) b e c o m p l e t e l y t h e m s e l v e s . )
T h e strength and inner clarity needed by the ego in order to make such a decision stem secretly from the Great Man, who apparently does not want to reveal himself too clearly. It m a y be that the Self wants the ego to m a k e a free choice, or it m a y be t h a t the Self d e p e n d s on h u m a n consciousness a n d its decisions to h e l p h i m to b e c o m e manifest. W h e n it c o m e s to such difficult ethical problems, no one can truly j u d g e the deeds of others. Each m a n has
to look to his own problem and try to determine w h a t is r i g h t for himself. As a n o l d Z e n B u d d hist Master said, we must follow the example of the cowherd w h o watches his ox "with a stick so t h a t it will not graze on o t h e r people's meadows." These new discoveries of depth psychology are bound to make some change in our collective ethical views, for they will compel us to j u d g e all h u m a n actions in a m u c h more individual and subtle way. T h e discovery of the unconscious is o n e of t h e m o s t f a r - r e a c h i n g discoveries of recent times. But the fact that recognition of its unconscious reality involves h o n e s t s e l f - e x a m i n a t i o n a n d r e o r g a n i z a t i o n of o n e ' s life causes m a n y p e o p l e to c o n t i n u e to b e h a v e as if n o t h i n g at all has h a p p e n e d . It takes a lot of courage to take the unconscious seriously a n d to tackle the p r o b l e m s it raises. Most people are too indolent to think deeply about even those moral aspects of their behavior of which they are conscious; they are certainly too lazy to consider how the unconscious affects them.

The anima: the woman within

O f t e n t h i s s e c o n d s y m b o l i c figure turns up behind the shadow, bringing up new and different p r o b l e m s . J u n g called its m a l e and female forms "animus" and "anima."
T h e a n i m a is a p e r s o n i f i c a t i o n of all f e m i n i n e psychological tendencies in a man's psyche, such as vague feelings and moods, prophetic hunches, receptiveness to the irrational, capacity for personal love, feeling for n a t u r e , a n d — last but not least — his r e l a t i o n to t h e u n c o n s c i o u s . It is n o mere chance that in olden times priestesses (like the Greek Sibyl) were used to fathom the divine will a n d to m a k e connection with the gods.
A particularly good example of how the a n i m a is e x p e r i e n c e d a s a n i n n e r figure i n a m a n ' s p s y c h e is found in t h e m e d i c i n e m e n a n d prophets (shamans) among the Eskimo and other arctic tribes. Some of these even wear women's clothes, or have breasts depicted on their garments, in order to manifest their inner feminine side — the side that enables them to connect with the "ghost l a n d " (i.e. what we call the unconscious).
O n e reported case tells of a young m a n w h o was being initiated by an older shaman and w h o w a s b u r i e d by h i m in a s n o w hole. H e fell into a state of dreaminess and exhaustion. In this coma he suddenly saw a w o m a n who emitted light. She instructed him in all he needed to know and later, as his protective spirit, helped him to practice his difficult profession b y r e l a t i n g h i m t o t h e p o w e r s of t h e b e

yond. Such an experience shows the a n i m a as the personification of a man's unconscious. In its individual manifestation the c h a r a c t e r of a m a n ' s a n i m a is as a r u l e s h a p e d b y his m o t h e r . If he feels t h a t his m o t h e r h a d a negative influence on him, his a n i m a will often express itself in irritable, depressed moods, u n c e r t a i n t y , i n s e c u r i t y , a n d t o u c h i n e s s . (If, h o w e v e r , he is a b l e to o v e r c o m e t h e n e g a t i v e assaults on himself, they can even serve to reinforce his masculinity.) Within the soul of such a m a n t h e n e g a t i v e m o t h e r - a n i m a figure w i l l endlessly repeat this theme: "I a m nothing. Nothing makes any sense. With others it's different, but for m e . . . I enjoy n o t h i n g . " These " a n i m a m o o d s " cause a sort of dullness, a fear of disease, of impotence, or of accidents. T h e w h o l e of life takes on a sad a n d oppressive aspect. Such dark moods can even lure a man to suicide, in which case the a n i m a becomes a death d e m o n . She appears in this role in C o c t e a u ' s film Orphee.

T h e G r e e k S i r e n s o r the G e r m a n Lorelei also personify this dangerous aspect of the a n i m a , which in this form symbolizes destructive illusion. T h e following Siberian tale illustrates the behavior of such a destructive anima:
O n e day a lonely hunter sees a beautiful w o m a n emerging from the deep forest on the other side of the river. She waves at him and sings: O h . come, lonely hunter in the stillness of dusk. Come, come! I miss you. I miss you! Now I will embrace you. embrace you! C o m e , c o m e ! M y nest is n e a r , my nest is n e a r . C o m e , come, lonely hunter, now in the stillness of dusk. He throws oil his clothes and swims across the river, but s u d d e n l y she Hies awav in the form "I an owl. laughing mockingly at him. When he tries to swim back to find his clothes, he drowns in the cold river.
In this tale the anima symbolizes an unreal d r e a m of love, happiness, and maternal w a r m t h (her nest) — a dream that lures men away from
The anima (like the shadow) has two aspects, benevolent and malefic (or negative) Left, a scene from Orphee (a f i l m v e r s i o n by C o c t e a u of the Orpheus myth): The w o m a n can be seen as a lethal anima. for she has led Orpheus (being carried by dark "underworld'' figures) to his doom. Also malevolent are the Lorelei of Teutonic myth (below, in a 19th-century drawing), water spirits whose singing lures men to their death. Below right, a parallel from Slavonic myth: the Rusalka. These beings were thought to be spirits of drowned girls w h o bewitch and drown passing men.

Another way in which the negative a n i m a in a man's personality c a n b e r e v e a l e d is in waspish, poisonous, effeminate remarks by which he devalues everything. R e m a r k s of this sort always c o n t a i n a c h e a p t w i s t i n g of t h e t r u t h and are in a subtle w a y destructive. T h e r e are legends t h r o u g h o u t the world in which " a poison d a m s e l " (as they call h e r in the O r i e n t ) appears. S h e is a b e a u t i f u l c r e a t u r e w h o h a s weapons hidden in her body or a secret poison with w h i c h s h e kills h e r l o v e r s d u r i n g t h e i r first night together. I n this guise t h e a n i m a is as cold a n d reckless as c e r t a i n u n c a n n y aspects of nature itself, a n d in E u r o p e is often expressed to this d a y b y t h e belief in w i t c h e s .

A n a n i m a of
this sort can turn men into sentimentalists, or they may become as touchy as old maids or as sensitive as the fairy-tale princess w h o could feel a p e a u n d e r 30 mattresses. A still m o r e subtle manifestation of a negative anima appears in some fairy tales in the form of a princess w h o asks her suitors to answer a series of riddles or, perhaps, to hide themselves under h e r nose. If they c a n n o t give t h e answers, o r if s h e c a n find t h e m , t h e y m u s t d i e a n d s h e i n variably wins. T h e anima in this guise involves men in a destructive intellectual game. W e can notice the effect of this a n i m a trick in all those neurotic pseudo-intellectual dialogues that inhibit a m a n from getting into direct touch with life a n d its real decisions. H e reflects a b o u t life so m u c h that he c a n n o t live it a n d loses all his spontaneity and outgoing feeling.
T h e most frequent manifestation of the anima takes the form of erotic fantasy. M e n may be driven to nurse their fantasies by looki n g a t films a n d s t r i p - t e a s e s h o w s , o r b y d a y d r e a m i n g o v e r p o r n o g r a p h i c m a t e r i a l .

T h e film is c o n c e r n e d w i t h t h e e x p l o i t s of a femme fatale (played by the French actress Jeanne Moreau) — a widely known term for the "dangerous" women whose relationships with men clearly image the nature of the negative anima.
The f o l l o w i n g is a description (taken from the poster above) of the central character of the film (a melodramatic description, but one that might fit many personifications of the negative anima): "Mysterious tantalizing — alluring - w a n t o n but deep within her burning the violent fires that destroy a man."
becomes compulsive only when a man does not sufficiently cultivate his feeling relationshipsw h e n his feeling a t t i t u d e t o w a r d life has remained infantile. All these aspects of the a n i m a have the same tendency that we have observed in the s h a d o w : T h a t is, they c a n be projected so that they appear to the m a n to be the qualities of some p a r t i c u l a r w o m a n . It is t h e p r e s e n c e of t h e a n i m a that causes a m a n to fall s u d d e n l y in l o v e w h e n h e s e e s a w o m a n for t h e first t i m e a n d k n o w s a t o n c e t h a t this is " s h e . " I n this situation, the m a n feels as if he has k n o w n this w o m a n intimately for all t i m e ; he falls for her so helplessly that it looks to outsiders like c o m plete madness. W o m e n who are of "fairy-like" character especially attract such anima projections, because men can attribute almost anyt h i n g to a c r e a t u r e w h o is so fascinatingly vague, and can thus proceed to weave fantasies a r o u n d her.
T h e projection of the a n i m a in such a sudden and passionate form as a love affair can greatly disturb a man's marriage and can lead to the so-called " h u m a n triangle," with its
accompanying difficulties. A bearable solution to s u c h a d r a m a c a n be found only if the a n i m a is r e c o g n i z e d as a n i n n e r p o w e r . T h e s e c r e t a i m of the unconscious in bringing about such an e n t a n g l e m e n t is to force a m a n to d e v e l o p a n d t o b r i n g h i s own b e i n g t o m a t u r i t y b y i n t e g r a t ing more of his unconscious personality and b r i n g i n g it into his real life.
But I have said enough about the negative side of the anima. There are just as m a n y imp o r t a n t positive aspects. T h e a n i m a is, for i n s t a n c e , r e s p o n s i b l e for t h e fact t h a t a m a n is a b l e t o find t h e r i g h t m a r r i a g e p a r t n e r .

Even m o r e vital is t h e role t h a t t h e a n i m a p l a y s in putting a m a n ' s mind in tune with the right inner values and thereby opening the way into m o r e p r o f o u n d i n n e r d e p t h s . It is as if a n i n n e r " r a d i o " becomes tuned to a certain wavelength that excludes irrelevancies but allows the voice of the Great M a n to be heard.

on the role of guide, or mediator, to the world w i t h i n a n d to t h e Self. T h a t is h o w she a p p e a r s in the e x a m p l e of t h e initiations of s h a m a n s that I d e s c r i b e d e a r l i e r ; this is t h e role of Beat r i c e i n D a n t e ' s Paradiso, a n d a l s o o f t h e g o d dess Isis w h e n she a p p e a r e d in a d r e a m to A p u l e i u s , t h e f a m o u s a u t h o r o f The Golden Ass, i n o r d e r t o i n i t i a t e h i m i n t o a h i g h e r , m o r e spiritual form of life.
T h e d r e a m of a 45-year-old psychotherapist may help to make clear how the anima can be an inner guide. As he was going to bed on the evening before he had this dream, he thought to himself t h a t it w a s h a r d to stand a l o n e in life, l a c k i n g t h e s u p p o r t of a c h u r c h . H e found himself envying people w h o are protected by the maternal embrace of an organization. (He had been born a Protestant but no longer had any religious affiliation.) This was his d r e a m :
I a m in the aisle of an old church filled with people. Together with my mother and my wife, I sit at the end of the aisle in w h a t seem to be extra seats. I am to celebrate the Mass as a priest, and I have a big Mass book in my hands, or, rather, a prayer book or an anthology of poems. This book is not familiar to m e , a n d I c a n n o t find t h e r i g h t text. I am very excited because I have to begin soon, and, to add to my troubles, my mother and wife d i s t u r b m e by c h a t t e r i n g a b o u t u n i m p o r t a n t trifles. N o w the o r g a n stops, a n d e v e r y b o d y is waiting for me, so I get u p in a d e t e r m i n e d w a y and ask o n e of t h e n u n s w h o is k n e e l i n g b e h i n d me to hand me her Mass book and point out the right place which she does in an obliging manner. Now, like a sort of sexton, this same nun precedes m e to the a l t a r , w h i c h is s o m e w h e r e b e h i n d me a n d to the left, as if we a r e a p p r o a c h i n g it from a side aisle. T h e M a s s book is like a sheet of pictures, a sort of board, three feet long and a foot w i d e , a n d on it is t h e text w i t h a n c i e n t p i c tures in columns, one beside the other.
First the nun has to read a part of the liturgy before I begin, and 1 have still not found the right place in t h e text. S h e h a s told m e t h a t it is N u m ber 15, but the numbers are not clear, and I cannot find it. With determination, however, I turn toward the congregation, and now I have found N u m b e r 15 (the next to the last on the b o a r d ) , although I d o not yet k n o w if I shall be a b l e to decipher it. I want to try all the same. I wake up.
Men project the anima on to things as well as w o m e n . For instance, ships are always k n o w n as "she"' above, the female figurehead on the old British clipper ship Cutty Sark. T h e c a p t a i n of a s h i p is symbolically " h e r " h u s b a n d , which may be w h y he must (according to tradition) go down w i t h t h e ship if " s h e " sinks.
A car is another kind of possession that is usually f e m i n i z e d — i.e. that can become the focus of many men's anima projections. Like ships, cars are called "she.'' and their owners caress and pamper them (below) like favorite mistresses.

T h e people (all his own psychic qualities) want him to function as the priest a n d celebrate the Mass himself.

nizcd more clearly than before. During this period, the knightly cult of the lady signified a n a t t e m p t t o d i f f e r e n t i a t e t h e f e m i n i n e s i d e of man's nature in regard to the outer w o m a n as well as in relation to the inner world. T h e lady to whose service the knight pledged himself, a n d for w h o m he performed his heroic deeds, was naturally a personification of the anima. The n a m e of the carrier of the Grail, in W o l f r a m v o n E s c h c n b a c h ' s v e r s i o n of t h e l e g e n d , is e s p e c i a l l y s i g n i f i c a n t : Conduir-amour ("guide in love matters"). She taught the hero to differentiate b o t h his feelings a n d his behavior toward women. Later, however, this ind i v i d u a l a n d p e r s o n a l effort of d e v e l o p i n g t h e relationship with the anima was abandoned w h e n h e r s u b l i m e a s p e c t f u s e d w i t h t h e figure of the Virgin, w h o then b e c a m e the object of boundless devotion and praise. When the anima, as Virgin, was conceived as being allpositive, her negative aspects found expression in the belief in witches.

A connection between the motif of four and the anima appears above in a painting by the Swiss artist Peter Birkhauser A four eyed anima appears as an overwhelming, terrifying vision The four eyes have a symbolic significance similar to that of the 16 pictures in the dream quoted on p. 1 8 3 : T h e y a l l u d e to t h e fact t h a t the anima contains the possibility of achieving wholeness.
In the painting, right, by the modern artist Slavko, the Self is separate from the anima but still merged with nature. The painting can be called a "soul landscape": On the left sits a dark-skinned, naked woman the anima. O n the right is a bear, the animal soul or instinct Near the anima is a d o u b l e t r e e symbolizing the individuation process in w h i c h the inner opposites unite In the background one at first sees a glacier, but on looking closely o n e sees that it is also a face. This face (from which the lifestream f l o w s ) is the Self. It has four eyes, and looks something like an a n i m a l , b e c a u s e it c o m e s f r o m instinctive nature (The painting thus provides a good example of the way an unconscious symbol can inadvertently find its way into a fantasy landscape.)

Worship of the a n i m a as an officially recognized religious figure brings the serious disadvantage that she loses her individual aspects. O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , if s h e is r e g a r d e d as a n e x c l u s i v e l y p e r s o n a l b e i n g , t h e r e is t h e d a n g e r t h a t , if s h e is p r o j e c t e d i n t o t h e o u t e r w o r l d , it is o n l y t h e r e t h a t s h e c a n b e f o u n d . T h i s l a t t e r state of affairs can create endless trouble, because m a n becomes either the victim of his erotic fantasies or compulsively dependent on one actual woman.
Only the painful (but essentially simple) decision to take one's fantasies and feelings seriously can at this stage prevent a complete stagnation of the inner process of individuation, because only in this way can a m a n discover w h a t t h i s figure m e a n s a s a n i n n e r r e a l i t y . T h u s the anima becomes again what she originally was—the " w o m a n within," who conveys the vital messages of the Self.
Medieval Europe's idea of "courtly love" was influenced by the worship of the Virgin Mary: Ladies to w h o m knights pledged love were believed to be as pure as the Virgin (of w h o m a typical medieval image was the doll-like carving, top of page, c. 1 4 0 0 ) .

The animus: the man within
T h e m a l e personification of the unconscious in woman —the animus exhibits both good and bad aspects, as does the a n i m a in m a n . But the animus does not so often a p p e a r in the form of an e r o t i c f a n t a s y o r m o o d ; it is m o r e a p t to take the form of a hidden "sacred" conviction. W h e n s u c h a c o n v i c t i o n is p r e a c h e d w i t h a loud, insistent, masculine voice or imposed on others by means of brutal emotional scenes, the u n d e r l y i n g m a s c u l i n i t y in a w o m a n is easily r e c o g n i z e d . H o w e v e r , e v e n in a w o m a n w h o is outwardly very feminine the animus can be an equally hard, inexorable power. One may sudd e n l y find o n e s e l f u p a g a i n s t s o m e t h i n g in a w o m a n t h a t is o b s t i n a t e , c o l d , a n d c o m p l e t e l y inaccessible.
O n e ol the favorite t h e m e s that the a n i m u s repeats endlessly in the ruminations of this kind of w o m a n goes like this: " T h e only t h i n g in the w o r l d t h a t I w a n t is l o v e — a n d h e d o e s n ' t love m e " ; or " I n this situation there are only two possibilities and both are equally bad."
( T h e animus never believes in exceptions.) O n e can rarely contradict an animus opinion bec a u s e it is usually right in a g e n e r a l w a y ; yet it s e l d o m s e e m s t o fit t h e i n d i v i d u a l s i t u a t i o n . It is a p t to b e a n o p i n i o n t h a t s e e m s r e a s o n a b l e but beside the point.
J u s t as t h e c h a r a c t e r of a m a n ' s a n i m a is s h a p e d b y his m o t h e r , so t h e a n i m u s is basically influenced by a woman's father. The father endows his daughter's animus with the special coloring of unarguable, incontestably " t r u e " convictions convictions that never include the personal reality of the w o m a n herself as she a c t u a l l y is.
T h i s is w h y t h e a n i m u s is s o m e t i m e s , like t h e anima, a d e m o n of death. For example, in a gypsy fairy tale a h a n d s o m e s t r a n g e r is received by a lonely w o m a n in spite of the fact that she h a s h a d a d r e a m w a r n i n g h e r t h a t h e is t h e king of the dead. After he has been with her for a time, she presses h i m to tell her w h o he r e a l l y is. A t first h e r e f u s e s , s a y i n g t h a t s h e w i l l

die if he tells her. S h e insists, h o w e v e r , a n d s u d d e n l y he r e v e a l s to h e r t h a t he is d e a t h himself. T h e w o m a n immediately dies of fright. Viewed mythologically, the beautiful stranger is p r o b a b l y a p a g a n f a t h e r - i m a g e o r g o d image, who appears here as king of the dead dike Hades' abduction of Persephone). But psychologically he represents a particular form ol t h e a n i m u s t h a t lures w o m e n a w a y from all h u m a n relationships a n d especially from all contacts with real men. He personifies a cocoon o f d r e a m y t h o u g h t s , filled w i t h d e s i r e a n d j u d g ments about how things "ought to be," which cut a w o m a n off from the reality of life.
The negative animus does not appear only as a d e a t h - d e m o n . In m y t h s a n d fairy tales he plays the role of robber and murderer. O n e e x a m p l e is B l u e b e a r d , w h o s e c r e t l y kills all his wives in a h i d d e n c h a m b e r . In this form the animus personifies all those semiconscious, cold, destructive reflections that invade a w o m a n in the small hours, especially when she has failed to r e a l i z e s o m e o b l i g a t i o n of f e e l i n g . It is t h e n that she begins to think about the family heritage and matters of that kind—a sort of web of c a l c u l a t i n g t h o u g h t s , filled w i t h m a l i c e a n d i n
trigue, which get her into a state where she even wishes death to others. ( " W h e n one of us dies, I'll move to the Riviera," said a w o m a n to her husband when she saw the beautiful Mediterranean coast a thought that was rend e r e d relatively harmless by reason ol the fact that she said it! I By nursing secret destructive attitudes, a wife can drive her husband, and a mother her children, into illness, accident, or even death. O r she may decide to keep the children from m a r r y i n g — a deeply hidden form of evil that rarely comes to the surface of the mother's conscious mind. (A naive old w o m a n once said to me, while showing me a picture of her son, who was d r o w n e d w h e n h e w a s 2 7 : " I prefer it this way; it's better than giving him away to another woman.")
A s t r a n g e p a s s i v i t y a n d p a r a l y s i s of a l l feeling, or a deep insecurity that can lead almost to a sense of nullity, may sometimes be the result of an unconscious animus opinion. In the d e p t h s of t h e w o m a n ' s b e i n g , t h e a n i m u s w h i s p e r s : " Y o u a r e h o p e l e s s . W h a t ' s t h e u s e of t r y i n g ? T h e r e is n o p o i n t in d o i n g a n y t h i n g . Life will never c h a n g e for the better."
The a n i m u s is o f t e n p e r s o n i f i e d as a group of men A negative group animus might appear as a dangerous band of criminals like the wreckers (above, in an 18th-century Italian painting) w h o once lured ships onto rocks with lights, killed survivors, and looted the wrecks

A frequent personification of the negative group animus in women's dreams has been the band of romantic but dangerous outlaws. Above, an ominous group of bandits from the 1 9 5 3 B r a z i l i a n f i l m The Bandit. concerning an adventurous woman schoolteacher w h o falls in love with a bandit leader.

T h e fairy q u e e n h a s b e e n caused (by magic) to fall in love with a peasant w h o has been given an ass's head, also by magic. This is a c o m i c t w i s t o n the tales in w h i c h a girl's love releases a man from a magic spell



Unfortunately, whenever one of these personifications of the unconscious takes possession of o u r m i n d , it seems as if w e ourselves a r e h a v ing such thoughts and feelings. T h e ego identifies w i t h t h e m t o t h e p o i n t w h e r e it is u n a b l e to detach t h e m a n d see t h e m for w h a t they are. O n e is r e a l l y " p o s s e s s e d " b y t h e figure f r o m t h e unconscious. Only after the possession has fallen away does one realize with horror that one has said and done things diametrically opposed to one's real thoughts and feelings—that one has been the prey of an alien psychic factor.
Like the anima, the animus does not merely consist of negative qualities such as brutality, recklessness, empty talk, and silent, obstinate, evil ideas. H e too has a very positive a n d valuable side; he too can build a bridge to the Self t h r o u g h h i s c r e a t i v e a c t i v i t y . T h e following dream of a w o m a n of 45 m a y help to illustrate this point:
Two veiled figures climb onto the balcony and into the house. They are swathed in black hooded coats, and they seem to want to torment me and my sister. She hides under the bed, but they pull her out with a b r o o m a n d t o r t u r e her. T h e n it is my turn. The leader of the two pushes me against the wall, making magical gestures before my face. In the meantime his helper makes a sketch on the wall, and when I see it, I say (in order to seem friendly), " O h ! But this is well d r a w n ! " Now suddenly my tormentor has the noble head of an artist, a n d he says p r o u d l y , " Y e s , i n d e e d , " and begins to clean his spectacles.

In many m y t h s a w o m a n ' s lover is a figure of mystery w h o m she must never try to see. Left, a late 1 8 t h century engraving of an example from Greek myth: The maiden Psyche, loved by Eros but forbidden to try to look at him. Eventually she did so and he left her; she w a s able t o regain his love only after a long search and m u c h suffering.
T h e s a d i s t i c a s p e c t o f t h e s e t w o figures w a s w e l l k n o w n t o t h e d r e a m e r , for i n r e a l i t y s h e frequently suffered bad attacks of anxiety during which she was haunted by the thought that people she loved were in great danger—or even that they were dead. But the fact that the anim u s figure in t h e d r e a m is d o u b l e suggests t h a t t h e b u r g l a r s personify a psychic factor t h a t is dual in its effect, a n d that could be something quite different from these tormenting thoughts. T h e sister of the dreamer, w h o runs away from t h e m e n , is c a u g h t a n d t o r t u r e d . I n r e a l i t y this sister died when fairly young. She had been artistically gifted, but had m a d e very little use of her talent. Next the d r e a m reveals that the veiled burglars are actually disguised artists, a n d that if the d r e a m e r recognizes their gifts (which are her own), they will give up their evil intentions.
W h a t is t h e d e e p e r m e a n i n g of t h e d r e a m ? It is t h a t b e h i n d t h e s p a s m s of a n x i e t y t h e r e is indeed a genuine and mortal danger; but there is a l s o a c r e a t i v e p o s s i b i l i t y for t h e d r e a m e r . She, like the sister, had some talent as a painter, but she doubted whether painting could be a meaningful activity for her. N o w her d r e a m tells her in the most earnest w a y that she must live out this talent. If she obeys, the destructive, tormenting animus will be transformed into a creative and meaningful activity.
As in this dream, the animus often appears as a group of men. In this way the unconscious symbolizes the fact that the animus represents a collective rather than a personal element. Because of this collective-mindedness w o m e n h a b i t u a l l y refer ( w h e n their a n i m u s is s p e a k i n g through them) to " o n e " or " t h e y " or "everybody," and in such circumstances their speech frequently contains the words "always" and "should" and "ought."

T h e i m p l i c a t i o n is t h a t , b y b l i n d l y t r u s t i n g a n d loving him, she will be able to redeem her bridegroom. But this never succeeds. She a l w a y s b r e a k s h e r p r o m i s e a n d finally finds h e r lover again only after a long, difficult quest and much suffering.
T h e p a r a l l e l in life is t h a t t h e c o n s c i o u s a t t e n tion a w o m a n has to give to her animus probl e m takes m u c h t i m e a n d involves a lot of suffering. But if she realizes w h o a n d w h a t her a n i m u s is a n d w h a t h e d o e s to h e r , a n d if she faces these realities instead of allowing herself to be possessed, her animus can turn into an invaluable inner companion who endows her with the masculine qualities of initiative, courage, objectivity, and spiritual wisdom.
T h e animus, just like the anima, exhibits four s t a g e s o f d e v e l o p m e n t . H e first a p p e a r s a s a personification of mere physical power—for instance, as an athletic champion or "muscle m a n . " In the next stage he possesses initiative a n d the capacity for p l a n n e d action. In the third phase, the animus becomes the "word," often appearing as a professor or clergyman. Finally, in his fourth manifestation, the animus is t h e i n c a r n a t i o n o f meaning. O n t h i s h i g h e s t level he becomes (like the anima) a mediator of t h e religious e x p e r i e n c e w h e r e b y life a c q u i r e s new meaning. He gives the w o m a n spiritual firmness, a n i n v i s i b l e i n n e r s u p p o r t t h a t c o m pensates for her o u t e r softness. T h e a n i m u s in his most developed form sometimes connects the woman's mind with the spiritual evolution
Embodiments of the four stages of the animus: First, the wholly physical man — the fictional lungle heroTarzan (top, played by Johnny Weismuller). Second, the "romantic" m a n — the 19th century British poet Shelley (center left): or the " m a n of a c t i o n " — A m e r i c a ' s Ernest Hemingway, war hero, hunter, etc. Third, the bearer of the " w o r d " — Lloyd George, the great political orator Fourth, the wise guide to spiritual truth—often projected on to Gandhi (left).

of her age, and can thereby make her even more receptive than a m a n to new creative i d e a s . It is for this r e a s o n t h a t in e a r l i e r t i m e s women were used by many nations as diviners and seers. T h e creative boldness of their positive animus at times expresses thoughts and ideas that stimulate men to new enterprises. The "inner m a n " within a woman's psyche can lead to marital troubles similar to those mentioned in the section on the anima. W h a t m a k e s t h i n g s especially c o m p l i c a t e d is t h e fact that the possession of one partner by the animus (or anima) may automatically exert such an irritating effect upon the other that he (or she) becomes possessed too. Animus and anima always tend to drag conversation down to a very low level and to produce a disagreeable, irascible, emotional atmosphere.
As I mentioned before, the positive side of the animus can personify an enterprising spirit, courage, truthfulness, and in the highest form, spiritual profundity. Through him a woman can experience the underlying processes of her cultural and personal objective situation, and c a n find h e r w a y t o a n i n t e n s i f i e d s p i r i t u a l a t t i t u d e to life. T h i s n a t u r a l l y presupposes t h a t her animus ceases to represent opinions that are a b o v e c r i t i c i s m . T h e w o m a n m u s t find t h e courage and inner broadmindedness to question the sacredness of her own convictions. Only then will she be able to take in the suggestions of the unconscious, especially when they contradict her animus opinions. Only then will the manifestations of the Self get through to her, and will she be able consciously to understand their meaning.



The Self: symbols of totality
If an individual has wrestled seriously enough and long enough with the anima (or animus) p r o b l e m so t h a t h e , or she, is n o l o n g e r p a r t i a l l y identified with it, the unconscious again changes its d o m i n a n t character a n d appears in a n e w symbolic form, r e p r e s e n t i n g the Self, the innermost nucleus of the psyche. In the dreams of a w o m a n this c e n t e r is u s u a l l y p e r s o n i f i e d as a superior female figure—a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a m a n , it manifests itself as a masc u l i n e i n i t i a t o r a n d g u a r d i a n ( a n I n d i a n guru), a wise old m a n , a spirit of nature, a n d so forth. T w o folk tales illustrate the role that such a figure c a n p l a y . T h e first is a n A u s t r i a n t a l e :
A king has ordered soldiers to keep the night watch beside the corpse of a black princess, who has been bewitched. Every midnight she rises and kills the guard. At last one soldier, whose turn it is to s t a n d g u a r d , despairs a n d r u n s a w a y into the woods. There he meets an "old guitarist who is o u r L o r d Himself." T h i s old m u s i c i a n tells h i m where to hide in the church and instructs him on how to behave so that the black princess cannot get him. With this divine help the soldier actually manages to redeem the princess and marry her.
Clearly, " t h e old guitarist w h o is o u r L o r d Himself" is, in psychological terms, a symbolic personification of t h e Self. W i t h his h e l p the e g o a v o i d s d e s t r u c t i o n a n d is a b l e to o v e r c o m e —and even redeem — a highly dangerous aspect of his anima.
In a w o m a n ' s psyche, as I have said, the Self assumes f e m i n i n e personifications. T h i s is illustrated in the second story, an Eskimo tale:
A lonely girl who has been disappointed in love meets a wizard traveling in a copper boat. H e is the "Spirit of the M o o n , " who has given all the animals to mankind and who also bestows luck in hunting. He abducts the girl to the heavenly realm. Once, when the Spirit of the Moon has
left her, she visits a little house near the M o o n G h o s t ' s m a n s i o n . T h e r e s h e finds a tiny w o m a n clothed in the "intestinal m e m b r a n e of the bearded seal," who warns the heroine against the Spirit of the M o o n , saying that he plans to kill her. (It a p p e a r s that he is a killer of w o m e n , a sort of Bluebeard.) T h e tiny w o m a n fashions a long rope by means of which the girl can descend to e a r t h at t h e time of t h e n e w m o o n , w h i c h is the moment when the little woman can weaken the Moon Spirit. T h e girl climbs down, but when she arrives on earth, she does not open her eyes as quickly as the little woman told her to. Because of this, she is t u r n e d into a spider a n d c a n never become human again.
As we have noted, the divine musician in the first t a l e is a r e p r e s e n t a t i o n o f t h e " w i s e o l d m a n , " a typical personification of t h e Self. H e is a k i n to t h e sorcerer M e r l i n of m e d i e v a l legend or to the Greek god Hermes. T h e little w o m a n in h e r s t r a n g e m e m b r a n e - c l o t h i n g is a parallel figure, symbolizing the Self as it appears in the feminine psyche. T h e old musician saves the hero from the destructive anima, and the little w o m a n protects the girl against the Eskimo " B l u e b e a r d " (who is, in the form of the M o o n Spirit, her animus). In this case, however, things go wrong—a point that I shall take up later.
T h e Self, h o w e v e r , does n o t always take the form of a wise old m a n or wise old woman. These paradoxical personifications are attempts to express s o m e t h i n g t h a t is n o t entirely contained in time—something simultaneously young a n d old.

This y o u t h signifies the Self, a n d with it ren e w a l o f life, a c r e a t i v e elan vital, a n d a n e w spiritual orientation by means of which everything b e c o m e s full of life a n d e n t e r p r i s e . If a m a n devotes himself to the instructions of his o w n u n c o n s c i o u s , it c a n b e s t o w this gift, so t h a t s u d d e n l y life, w h i c h h a s b e e n stale a n d dull, turns into a rich, unending inner adventure, full of creative possibilities. In a w o m a n ' s psychology, this same youthful personification of the Self c a n a p p e a r as a s u p e r n a t u r a l l y gifted girl. T h e d r e a m e r in this i n s t a n c e is a w o m a n in her late forties:
I stood in front of a church and was washing the pavement with water. T h e n I ran down the street just at the moment when the students from the high school were let out. I came to a stagnant river across which a board or tree trunk had been laid; but when I was attempting to walk across, a mischievous student bounced on the board so that it c r a c k e d a n d I nearly fell into t h e w a t e r .
"Idiot!" I yelled out. O n the other side of the river three little girls were playing, and one of t h e m stretched out her h a n d as if to help me. I thought that her small hand was not strong enough to help me, but when I took it, she succeeded, without the slightest effort, in pulling me across and up the bank on the other side.
T h e d r e a m e r is a religious p e r s o n , b u t according to her d r e a m she c a n n o t remain in the C h u r c h (Protestant) any longer; in fact, she seems to have lost the possibility of entering it, a l t h o u g h she tries to keep the access to it as clean as she can. According to the dream, she must now cross a stagnant river, and this indic a t e s that the flow of life is s l o w e d d o w n because of the unresolved religious problem. ( C r o s s i n g a r i v e r is a f r e q u e n t s y m b o l i c i m a g e for a fundamental change of attitude.) T h e student was interpreted by the dreamer herself as the personification of a thought that she had previously h a d — namely, that she might satisfy her spiritual yearning by attending high school. Obviously the d r e a m does not think much of this plan. W h e n she dares to cross the river alone, a personification of the Self (the girl), small but supernaturally powerful, helps her.
But the form of a h u m a n being, whether y o u t h f u l o r o l d , is o n l y o n e of t h e m a n y w a y s in which the Self can a p p e a r in d r e a m s or visions.

s c i o u s l y r e a l i z e d flow o f life — w h i c h is w h a t creates our experience of time. J u s t as t h e Self is n o t entirely c o n t a i n e d in our conscious experience of time (in our spacet i m e d i m e n s i o n ) , it is also s i m u l t a n e o u s l y o m n i present. M o r e o v e r , it a p p e a r s frequently in a form that hints at a special omnipresence; that is, it manifests itself as a g i g a n t i c , s y m b o l i c human being who embraces and contains the whole cosmos. W h e n this image turns u p in the d r e a m s of an individual, we m a y hope for a creative solution to his conflict, because now t h e vital p s y c h i c c e n t e r is a c t i v a t e d (i.e. t h e w h o l e b e i n g is c o n d e n s e d i n t o o n e n e s s ) in o r d e r to overcome the difficulty.
It is n o w o n d e r t h a t this figure of t h e C o s m i c M a n appears in m a n y myths and religious t e a c h i n g s . G e n e r a l l y h e is d e s c r i b e d as s o m e thing helpful and positive. H e appears as A d a m , as the Persian G a y o m a r t , or as the H i n d u P u r u s h a . T h i s figure m a y e v e n b e d e scribed as the basic principle of the whole world. T h e ancient Chinese, for instance, t h o u g h t that before anything whatever was created, there was a colossal divine m a n called P'an K u who gave heaven and earth their form. When he cried, his tears m a d e the Yellow River and the Yangtze River; when he breathed, the wind rose; when he spoke, thunder was loosed; and w h e n h e l o o k e d a r o u n d , l i g h t n i n g flashed. I f h e w a s i n a g o o d m o o d , t h e w e a t h e r w a s fine; if h e was sad, it c l o u d e d over. W h e n he died, h e fell a p a r t , a n d f r o m h i s b o d y t h e five h o l y mountains of China sprang into existence. His head b e c a m e the T'ai m o u n t a i n in the East, his trunk b e c a m e the Sung m o u n t a i n in the center, his right a r m the H e n g m o u n t a i n in the N o r t h , his left a r m the H e n g m o u n t a i n in the South, a n d his feet the H u a m o u n t a i n in the West. His eyes became the sun and moon.
We have already seen that symbolic structures that seem to refer to the process of individuation tend to be based on the motif of the n u m b e r four such as the four functions of consciousness, or the four stages of the anima or animus. It reappears here in the cosmic shape of P'an Ku. Only under specific circumstances do other combinations of numbers a p p e a r in the psychic material. T h e natural unh a m p e r e d manifestations of the center are c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y f o u r f o l d n e s s - t h a t is to say, by having four divisions, or some other structure deriving from the n u m e r i c a l series of 4, 8, 16, a n d so o n . N u m b e r 16 plays a p a r t i c u l a r l y imp o r t a n t role, since it is c o m p o s e d of four fours.
In our Western civilization, similar ideas of a Cosmic M a n have attached themselves to the s y m b o l of A d a m , t h e First M a n . T h e r e is a Jewish legend that when God created Adam, h e first g a t h e r e d r e d , b l a c k , w h i t e , a n d y e l l o w dust from the four corners of the world, and thus A d a m "reached from one end of the world to the other." W h e n he bent down, his head was in the East a n d his feet in the West. According to another Jewish tradition, the whole of m a n k i n d was contained in A d a m from the beginning, which meant the soul of everybody w h o would ever be born. T h e soul of A d a m , therefore, was "like the wick of a lamp composed of innumerable strands." In this symbol the idea of a total oneness of all h u m a n e x i s t e n c e , b e y o n d all i n d i v i d u a l u n i t s , is c l e a r l y expressed.
In ancient Persia, the same original First M a n called Gayomart — was depicted as a h u g e figure e m i t t i n g l i g h t . W h e n h e d i e d , e v e r y kind of metal sprang from his body, and from his soul c a m e gold.

Many people today personify the Self in their dreams as prominent public figures Jungian psychologists find that, in men's dreams. Dr. Albert Schweitzer (far left) and Sir Winston Churchill (left) often appear; in w o m e n ' s dreams, Eleanor Roosevelt (right) and Q u e e n Elizabeth II (far right, a portrait on an African house).



Cosmic Man the gigantic, allembracing figure that personifies and contains the entire universe—is a c o m m o n representation of the Self in myths and dreams. Left, the title page of Leviathan, b y t h e 1 7 t h - c e n t u r y English philosopher Thomas Hobbes. The gigantic figure of Leviathan is made u p of all the people of the " c o m m o n w e a l t h " — Hobbes's ideal society, in which the people choose their o w n central authority (or "sovereign," hence Leviathan's crown, sword, and scepter).

P e r h a p s this is b e c a u s e the First M a n w a s t h o u g h t of as a selfgrown, living unit that just existed without any animal impulse or self-will. A m o n g a group of people who live on the banks of the Tigris. A d a m is still, a t t h e p r e s e n t t i m e , w o r s h i p e d as the hidden "super-soul" or mystical "protective spirit" of the entire h u m a n race. These people say that he came from a date palm another repetition of the plant motif.
In the East, and in some gnostic circles in the West, people soon recognized that the Cosmic Man was more an inner psychic image than a concrete outer reality. According to Hindu t r a d i t i o n , for i n s t a n c e , he is s o m e t h i n g t h a t lives w i t h i n t h e i n d i v i d u a l h u m a n b e i n g a n d is the only p a r t t h a t is i m m o r t a l . T h i s i n n e r G r e a t Man redeems the individual by leading him out of creation a n d its sufferings, back into his original eternal sphere. But he can do this only if m a n r e c o g n i z e s h i m a n d rises from his sleep in order to be led. In the symbolic myths of
old I n d i a , this figure is k n o w n as t h e P u r u s h a , a name that simply means " m a n " or "person." T h e P u r u s h a lives within the heart of every individual, and yet at the same time he fills t h e e n t i r e c o s m o s . According to the testimony of many myths, t h e C o s m i c M a n is n o t o n l y t h e b e g i n n i n g b u t a l s o t h e final g o a l o f a l l life o f t h e w h o l e of creation. "All cereal n a t u r e m e a n s wheat, all treasure nature means gold, all generation means m a n , " says the medieval sage Meister E c k h a r t . A n d if o n e looks at this from a psychological s t a n d p o i n t , it is c e r t a i n l y so. T h e whole inner psychic reality of each individual is u l t i m a t e l y o r i e n t e d t o w a r d this a r c h e t y p a l s y m b o l of the Self.
In practical terms this means that the existence of h u m a n beings will never be satisfactorily explained in terms of isolated instincts or purposive mechanism such as hunger, power, sex, survival, perpetuation of the species, and so on. T h a t is, m a n ' s m a i n p u r p o s e is n o t to e a t , d r i n k , e t c . , b u t lo be human. A b o v e a n d b e y o n d t h e s e drives, our inner psychic reality serves to manifest a living mystery that c a n be expressed only by a symbol, a n d for its expression the unconscious often chooses the powerful image of the Cosmic Man.
In our Western civilization the Cosmic Man has been identified to a great extent with Christ, and in the East with Krishna or with Buddha.

an unknowable secret — to the ultimate unknown meaning of h u m a n existence. As we have noted, certain traditions assert t h a t t h e C o s m i c M a n is t h e g o a l of c r e a t i o n , but the achievement of this should not be understood as a possible external happening. From the point of view of the H i n d u , for e x a m p l e , it is n o t so m u c h t h a t t h e e x t e r n a l w o r l d will o n e day dissolve into the original Great M a n , but that the ego's extraverted orientation toward the external world will disappear in order to m a k e w a y for the Cosmic M a n . This h a p p e n s w h e n the ego merges into the Self. T h e ego's d i s c u r s i v e flow o f r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s ( w h i c h g o e s from one t h o u g h t to another) a n d its desires (which run from one object to another) calm d o w n w h e n t h e G r e a t M a n w i t h i n is e n c o u n t ered.

versality of the symbol of the Great M a n . His i m a g e is p r e s e n t in t h e m i n d s of m e n as a sort of goal or expression of the basic mystery of o u r life. Because this s y m b o l represents that w h i c h is w h o l e a n d c o m p l e t e , it is often c o n ceived of as a bisexual being. In this form the symbol reconciles one of the most important pairs of psychological opposites — male and female. This union also appears frequently in dreams as a divine, royal, or otherwise distinguished couple. T h e following d r e a m of a man of 47 shows this aspect of the Self in a dramatic way:
I am on a platform, and below me I see a huge, black, beautiful she-bear with a rough but wellg r o o m e d coat. She is s t a n d i n g on her hind legs, a n d on a stone slab she is polishing a flat oval black stone, which becomes increasingly shiny. Not far away a lioness and her cub do the same thing, but the stones they are polishing are bigger and round in shape. After a while the she-bear turns into a fat, naked w o m a n with black hair and dark, fiery eyes. I behave in an erotically provocative way toward her, and suddenly she moves nearer in order to catch me. I get frightened and take refuge up on the building of scaffolding w h e r e I w a s before. L a t e r I a m in t h e midst of many women, half of whom are primitive and have rich black hair (as if they arc transformed from animals); the other half are our women [of the same nationality as the dreamer] and have blonde or brown hair. The primitive women sing a very sentimental song in melancholy, highpitched voices. Now, in a high elegant carriage, there comes a young m a n who wears on his head a royal golden crown, set with shining rubies

a very beautiful sight. Beside him sits a blonde young woman, probably his wife, but without a crown. It seems that the lioness and her cub have been transformed into this couple. They belong to the g r o u p of primitives. N o w all the w o m e n (the primitives and the others) intone a solemn song, and the royal carriage slowly travels toward the horizon.
Here the inner nucleus of the dreamer's p s y c h e s h o w s i t s e l f a t first in a t e m p o r a r y v i s i o n of t h e r o y a l c o u p l e , w h i c h e m e r g e s f r o m t h e depths of his animal nature and the primitive layer of his unconscious. T h e she-bear in the b e g i n n i n g is a sort o f m o t h e r g o d d e s s . ( A r t e m i s , for i n s t a n c e , w a s w o r s h i p e d in G r e e c e as a shebear. ) The dark oval stone that she rubs and polishes probably symbolizes the dreamer's innermost being, his true personality. R u b b i n g a n d polishing stones is a w e l l - k n o w n , e x c e e d ingly ancient activity of man. In Europe "holy" stones, w r a p p e d in bark a n d hidden in caves, have been found in m a i n places; as c o n t a i n e r s of d i v i n e p o w e r s t h e y w e r e p r o b a b l y k e p t t h e r e by men of the Stone Age. At the present time some of the Australian aborigines believe that their dead ancestors continue to exist in stones as v i r t u o u s a n d d i v i n e p o w e r s , a n d t h a t if they rub these stones, the power increases (like charging t h e m with electricity) for the benefit of both the living a n d the d e a d .
The man who had the dream wc are discussing had hitherto refused to accept a marital bond with a w o m a n . His fear of being caught by this aspect of life c a u s e d h i m , in the d r e a m , to flee f r o m t h e b e a r - w o m a n t o t h e s p e c t a t o r ' s platform where he could passively watch things without becoming entangled. Through the motif of the stone being r u b b e d by the bear, the u n c o n s c i o u s is t r y i n g to s h o w h i m t h a t h e s h o u l d let himself c o m e into c o n t a c t with this side of life; it is t h r o u g h t h e frictions of m a r r i e d life that his inner being can be shaped and polished.
W h e n t h e s t o n e is p o l i s h e d , it will b e g i n t o shine like a mirror so that the bear can see herself in it; this m e a n s that only by a c c e p t i n g earthly contact and suffering can the h u m a n soul be transformed into a mirror in which the divine powers can perceive themselves. But the
In dreams a mirror can symbolize the power of the unconscious to "mirror" the individual objectively — g i v i n g him a view of himself that he may never have had before Only through the unconscious can such a view (which often shocks and upsets the conscious mind) be obtained just as in Greek m y t h the G o r g o n Medusa, whose look turned men to stone, could be gazed upon only in a mirror. Below, Medusa reflected in a shield (a painting by the 17thcentury artist Caravaggio).
d r e a m e r runs a w a y to a higher place - i.e. into all sorts of reflections by which he can escape the d e m a n d s of life. T h e d r e a m then shows him that if he r u n s a w a y from the d e m a n d s of life, one part of his soul (his a n i m a ) will remain undifferentiated, a fact symbolized by the g r o u p of nondescript women that splits apart into a primitive half and a more civilized one.
T h e lioness and her son, which then appear on the scene, personify the mysterious urge toward individuation, indicated by their work at s h a p i n g t h e r o u n d s t o n e s . (A r o u n d s t o n e is a symbol of the Self.) T h e lions, a royal couple, are in themselves a symbol of totality. In medieval symbolism, the "philosopher's s t o n e " (a
205



p r e - e m i n e n t s y m b o l of m a n ' s w h o l e n e s s ) is represented as a pair of lions or as a h u m a n couple riding on lions. Symbolically, this points to the fact that often the urge toward individuation appears in a veiled form, hidden in the o v e r w h e l m i n g passion o n e m a y feel for a n o t h e r person. (In fact, passion that goes beyond the natural measure of love ultimately aims at the m y s t e r y of b e c o m i n g w h o l e , a n d this is w h y o n e feels, w h e n one has fallen passionately in love, t h a t b e c o m i n g o n e w i t h t h e o t h e r p e r s o n is the only w o r t h w h i l e goal of one's life.)
As long as the image of totality in this dream e x p r e s s e s itself in t h e f o r m o f a p a i r o f l i o n s , it is still c o n t a i n e d in s o m e s u c h o v e r w h e l m i n g passion. But when lion and lioness have turned into a king and queen, the urge to individuate has reached the level of conscious realization, and can now be understood by the ego as being the real goal of life.
Before the lions had transformed themselves into h u m a n beings, it was only the primitive w o m e n w h o sang, a n d they did so in a sentim e n t a l m a n n e r ; t h a t is to say, t h e feelings of the dreamer remained on a primitive and sentimental level. But in honor of the humanized lions, both the primitive and the civilized women chant a common hymn of praise. Their expression of their feelings in a united form shows that the inner split in the animal has now changed into inner harmony.
Still another personification of the Self appears in a report of a w o m a n ' s so-called " a c t i v e i m a g i n a t i o n . " ( A c t i v e i m a g i n a t i o n is a certain way of meditating imaginatively, by

W h e n I appear, I redeem you from the meaningless h a z a r d s o f life. T h e fire b u r n i n g i n s i d e m e b u r n s in the whole of nature. If a m a n loses it, he becomes egocentric, lonely, disoriented, and weak."
T h e Self is often s y m b o l i z e d as a n a n i m a l , representing o u r instinctive n a t u r e a n d its conn e c t e d n e s s w i t h o n e ' s s u r r o u n d i n g s . ( T h a t is why there are so m a n y helpful animals in myths and fairy tales.) This relation of the Self to all surrounding nature and even the cosmos probably comes from the fact that the "nuclear a t o m " of o u r p s y c h e is s o m e h o w w o v e n i n t o the whole world, both o u t e r a n d inner. All the h i g h e r manifestations of life a r e s o m e h o w t u n e d to the surrounding space-time continuum. A n i m a l s , for e x a m p l e , h a v e their o w n special foods, their particular home-building materials, and their definite territories, to all of which their instinctive patterns are exactly tuned and adapted. T i m e rhythms also play their part: W e have only to think of the fact that most grass-eating animals have their young at precisely t h e t i m e of y e a r w h e n t h e grass is richest

and most abundant. With such considerations in m i n d , a w e l l - k n o w n zoologist has said that the " i n w a r d n e s s " of each animal reaches far o u t i n t o t h e w o r l d a r o u n d it a n d " p s y c h i f i e s " time and space. In ways that are still completely beyond our c o m p r e h e n s i o n , o u r u n c o n s c i o u s is s i m i l a r l y attuned to our surroundings to our group, to society in general, and, beyond these, to the space-time continuum and the whole of nature. T h u s the Great M a n of the Naskapi Indians does not merely reveal inner truths; he also gives hints about where and when to hunt. And so from d r e a m s the Naskapi h u n t e r evolves the words and melodies of the magical songs with which he attracts the animals.
But this specific help from the unconscious is n o t g i v e n to p r i m i t i v e m a n a l o n e . J u n g discovered that dreams can also give civilized man the g u i d a n c e he needs in finding his way through the problems of both his inner and his o u t e r life. I n d e e d , m a n y ol o u r d r e a m s a r e conc e r n e d w i t h details of o u r o u t e r life a n d o u r surroundings. Such things as the tree in front of the window, one's bicycle or car, or a stone picked up during a walk may be raised to the
level of s y m b o l i s m t h r o u g h o u r d r e a m life a n d become meaningful. If we pay attention to our dreams, instead of living in a cold, impersonal world of meaningless chance, we m a y begin to e m e r g e into a w o r l d of o u r o w n , full of i m p o r tant and secretly ordered events. O u r dreams, however, are not as a ride primarily concerned with our adaptation to o u t e r life. In o u r civilized world, most d r e a m s have to do with the development (by the ego) of the " r i g h t " i n n e r a t t i t u d e t o w a r d the Self, for this r e l a t i o n s h i p is far m o r e d i s t u r b e d in us b y m o d e r n w a y s of t h i n k i n g a n d b e h a v i n g t h a n is t h e case w i t h p r i m i t i v e p e o p l e . They g e n erally live directly from the inner center, but we, with o u r u p r o o t e d consciousness, are so entangled with external, completely foreign m a t t e r s t h a t it is v e r y difficult for t h e messages of the Self to get through to us. O u r conscious mind continually creates the illusion of a clearly shaped, " r e a l " outer world that blocks off m a n y other perceptions. Yet through our unconscious nature we are inexplicably connected to our psychic and physical environment.
I have already mentioned the fact that the Self is s y m b o l i z e d w i t h s p e c i a l f r e q u e n c y in t h e
The "eternal" quality of stones can be seen in pebbles or mountains. Left, rocks beneath M t Williamson, California. Thus stone has always been used for memorials—like the heads of four U S. presidents (above) carved in the cliff face of Mt. Rushmore, South Dakota Stones were also often used to mark places of worship — as was the sacred stone in the Temple of Jerusalem (far r i g h t ) . It w a s the center of the city; and (as the medieval map, right, shows) the city was seen as the center of the world



f o r m of" a s t o n e , p r e c i o u s o r o t h e r w i s e . W c s a w an example of this in the stone that was being polished by the she-bear and the lions. In many d r e a m s the n u c l e a r center, the Self, also a p p e a r s as a crystal. T h e m a t h e m a t i c a l l y precise a r r a n g e m e n t of a crystal evokes in us the intuitive feeling that even in so-called " d e a d " matter t h e r e is a s p i r i t u a l o r d e r i n g p r i n c i p l e a t work. Thus the crystal often symbolically stands for the u n i o n of e x t r e m e opposites —of m a t t e r and spirit.
Perhaps crystals and stones are especially apt symbols of the Self because of the "just-so-ness" of their n a t u r e . M a n y people c a n n o t refrain from picking up stones of a slightly unusual color or shape and keeping them, without knowing w h y t h e y d o this. It is as if t h e s t o n e s h e l d a living mystery that fascinates them. Men have collected stones since the beginning of time and have apparently assumed that certain ones were the containers of the life-force with all its mystery. T h e ancient G e r m a n s , for instance, believed that the spirits of the dead continued to live in their tombstones. T h e custom of placing stones on graves may spring partly from the symbolic idea that something eternal of the dead
person remains, which can be most fittingly represented by a stone, for while the h u m a n b e i n g is as d i f f e r e n t as p o s s i b l e f r o m a s t o n e , y e t m a n ' s i n n e r m o s t c e n t e r is in a s t r a n g e a n d special w a y akin to it ( p e r h a p s b e c a u s e the stone symbolizes mere existence at the farthest remove from the emotions, feelings, fantasies, and discursive thinking of ego-consciousnessi. In this sense t h e s t o n e s y m b o l i z e s w h a t is p e r h a p s the simplest and deepest experience —the experience of something eternal that m a n can h a v e in those m o m e n t s w h e n he feels i m m o r t a l and unalterable.
T h e u r g e t h a t w e find i n p r a c t i c a l l y a l l c i v i l i zations to erect stone monuments to famous men or on the site of important events probably a l s o s t e m s f r o m t h i s s y m b o l i c m e a n i n g of t h e stone. The stone that Jacob placed on the spot where he had his famous d r e a m , or certain stones left by s i m p l e p e o p l e on the t o m b s of local saints or heroes, show the original nature of the h u m a n urge to express an otherwise inexp r e s s i b l e e x p e r i e n c e b y t h e s t o n e - s y m b o l . It is no wonder that many religious cults use a stone to signify God or to mark a place of worship. The holiest s a n c t u a r y of t h e I s l a m i c w o r l d is t h e



K a ' a b a , the black stone in M e c c a to which all pious Moslems hope to make their pilgrimage. According to Christian ecclesiastical symbolism, C h r i s t is " t h e stone w h i c h the b u i l d e r s rejected," which became "the head of the corn e r " ( L u k e x x : 17). A l t e r n a t i v e l y h e is called the "spiritual rock" from which the water of life s p r i n g s (1 C o r . x : 4 ) . M e d i e v a l alchemis.ts, w h o searched for the secret of m a t t e r in a pres c i e n t i f i c w a y , h o p i n g t o find G o d i n it, o r at least the working of divine activity, believed that this secret was embodied in their famous "philosopher's stone." But some of the alchemists dimly perceived that their much-soughtafter stone was a symbol of something that can be found only within the psyche of man. An old Arabian alchemist, Morienus, said: "This t h i n g [ t h e p h i l o s o p h e r ' s s t o n e ] is e x t r a c t e d from you: you a r e its m i n e r a l , a n d o n e c a n find it in y o u ; or, to p u t it m o r e clearly, they [the alchemists] take it from you. If y o u r e c o g n i z e this, the love and approbation of the stone will g r o w w i t h i n you. K n o w t h a t this is t r u e w i t h out doubt."
T h e a l c h e m i c a l s t o n e ( t h e lapis) s y m b o l i z e s something that can never be lost or dissolved, something eternal that some alchemists compared to the mystical experience of God within one's own soul. It usually takes prolonged suffering to burn away all the superfluous psychic elements concealing the stone. But some profound inner experience of the Self does occur to most people at least once in a lifetime. From the psychological standpoint, a genuinely religious attitude consists of an effort to discover this unique experience, and gradually to keep in t u n e w i t h it (it is r e l e v a n t t h a t a s t o n e is itself something p e r m a n e n t ) , so that the Self becomes an inner p a r t n e r toward w h o m c /ie's a t t e n t i o n is c o n t i n u a l l y t u r n e d .

unexplained connection (it m a y prove to be that "psyche" and "matter" are actually the same phenomenon, one observed from "within" and the other from " w i t h o u t " ) , Dr. J u n g put forw a r d a n e w c o n c e p t t h a t h e c a l l e d synchronicily. T h i s t e r m m e a n s a " m e a n i n g f u l c o i n c i dence" of outer and inner events that are not themselves causally connected. T h e emphasis lies on the w o r d " m e a n i n g f u l . "
If an aircraft crashes before my eyes as I a m b l o w i n g m y n o s e , this is a c o i n c i d e n c e of e v e n t s that h a s n o m e a n i n g . It is s i m p l y a c h a n c e occurrence of a kind that happens all the time. But if I b o u g h t a b l u e frock a n d , by m i s t a k e , the shop delivered a black one on the day one of m y n e a r relatives died, this w o u l d be a meaningful coincidence. The two events are not causally related, but they are connected by the symbolic meaning that our society gives to the color black.
Wherever Dr. J u n g observed such meaningful coincidences in a n individual's life, it s e e m e d (as the individual's dreams revealed) that there was an archetype activated in the unconscious of the i n d i v i d u a l c o n c e r n e d . T o illustrate this by my example of the black frock: In such a case the person w h o receives the black frock might also have had a d r e a m on the t h e m e of death. It seems as if t h e u n d e r l y i n g a r c h e t y p e is m a n i festing itself simultaneously in inner and external events. T h e c o m m o n d e n o m i n a t o r is a symbolically expressed message — in this case a message about death.
As soon as we notice that certain types of event "like" to cluster together at certain times, we begin to understand the attitude of the Chinese, whose theories of medicine, philosophy, and even building are based on a "science" of m e a n i n g f u l c o i n c i d e n c e s .

In creating the concept of synchronicity, Dr. J u n g sketched a way in which we might penetrate deeper into the inter-relation of psyche a n d m a t t e r . A n d it is precisely t o w a r d s u c h a relation that the symbol of the stone seems to p o i n t . B u t this is still a c o m p l e t e l y o p e n a n d insufficiently explored matter, with which future generations of psychologists and physicists must deal.
It m a y seem that m y discussion of synchronicity has led me away from my main theme, but I feel it is necessary to m a k e at least a brief i n t r o d u c t o r y r e f e r e n c e to it b e c a u s e it is a J u n g i a n hypothesis that seems to be pregnant with future possibilities of investigation and application. Synchronistic events, moreover, almostinvariably accompany thecrucial phases of the process of individuation. But too often they pass unnoticed, because the individual has not learned to w a t c h for such coincidences a n d to make them meaningful in relation to the symbolism of his dreams.

The relation to the Self
Nowadays more and more people, especially those who live in large cities, suffer from a terrible e m p t i n e s s a n d b o r e d o m , as if they w e r e waiting for s o m e t h i n g that never arrives. Movies and television, spectator sports and political excitements m a y divert t h e m for a while, b u t again and again, exhausted and disenchanted, they have to return to the wasteland of their own lives.
T h e o n l y a d v e n t u r e t h a t is still w o r t h w h i l e for m o d e r n m a n lies in the inner realm of the unconscious psyche. With this idea vaguely in mind, many now turn to Yoga and other Eastern practices. But these offer no genuine new a d v e n t u r e , for in t h e m one only takes over w h a t is a l r e a d y k n o w n to t h e H i n d u s o r t h e Chinese without directly meeting one's own i n n e r life c e n t e r . W h i l e it is t r u e t h a t E a s t e r n methods serve to concentrate the mind and d i r e c t it i n w a r d ( a n d t h a t this p r o c e d u r e is in a sense similar to the introversion of an analytical,treat m e n t ) , t h e r e is a v e r y i m p o r t a n t difference. J u n g evolved a way of getting-to one's inner center and making contact with the living mystery of the unconscious, alone and unaided. T h a t is u t t e r l y different from following a wellworn path.
Trying to give the living reality of the Self a c o n s t a n t a m o u n t of d a i l y a t t e n t i o n is like trying to live simultaneously on two levels or in two different worlds. O n e gives one's mind, as
before, to outer duties, but at the same time o n e remains alert for hints a n d signs, both in dreams and in external events, that the Self uses to symbolize its intentions — the direction in w h i c h t h e life-stream is m o v i n g . Old Chinese texts that are concerned with this kind of experience often use the simile of the cat watching the mousehole. O n e text says that one should allow no other thoughts to intrude, but one's attention should not be too s h a r p — n o r s h o u l d it be too d u l l . T h e r e is exactly the right level of perception. "If the t r a i n i n g is u n d e r g o n e in this m a n n e r . . . it will be effective as time goes on, and when the cause comes to fruition, like a ripe melon that autom a t i c a l l y falls, a n y t h i n g it m a y h a p p e n to touch or make contact with will suddenly cause t h e i n d i v i d u a l ' s s u p r e m e a w a k e n i n g . T h i s is t h e m o m e n t when the practitioner will be like one w h o drinks water a n d alone knows w h e t h e r it is cold o r w a r m . H e b e c o m e s free of all d o u b t s about himself and experiences a great happiness similar to that one feels in m e e t i n g one's o w n father at the crossroads."
T h u s , in the midst of o r d i n a r y o u t e r life, o n e is s u d d e n l y c a u g h t u p in a n e x c i t i n g i n n e r a d v e n t u r e ; a n d b e c a u s e it is u n i q u e for e a c h individual, it c a n n o t be copied or stolen.

I n t h i s c o n n e c t i o n it is i n t e r e s t i n g t h a t a N a s kapi hunter pictorially represented his Great M a n not as a h u m a n being but as a mandala. Whereas the Naskapi experience the inner center directly and naively, without the help of religious rites or doctrines, other communities use the m a n d a l a motif in o r d e r to restore a lost inner balance. Forinstance, the Navaho Indians try, by means of mandala-structurcd sand paintings, to bring a sick person back into harmony with himself and with the cosmos and thereby to restore his health.
In Eastern civilizations similar pictures are used to consolidate the inner being, or to enable one to plunge into deep meditation. T h e cont e m p l a t i o n of a m a n d a l a is m e a n t to b r i n g a n i n n e r p e a c e , a feeling t h a t life has a g a i n found its m e a n i n g and order.

year-old woman. It emerged as a prelude to a new p h a s e of life in w h i c h she b e c a m e v e r y creative:
I see a landscape in a dim light. In the background I see the rising and then evenly continuing crest of a hill. Along the line where it rises moves a quadrangular disk that shines like gold. In the foreground I see d a r k plowed earth that is beginning to sprout. Now I suddenly perceive a round table with a gray stone slab as its top, and at the same m o m e n t the q u a d r a n g u l a r disk suddenly stands u p o n the table. It has left the hill, but how a n d why it has c h a n g e d its place I d o not know.
Landscapes in d r e a m s (as well as in art) frequently symbolize an inexpressible mood. In this d r e a m , the d i m light of the landscape indicates that the clarity of daytime consciousness is d i m m e d . " I n n e r n a t u r e " m a y n o w b e g i n t o reveal itself in its o w n light, so w e a r e told that the q u a d r a n g u l a r disk becomes visible on the horizon. H i t h e r t o the s y m b o l of the Self, t h e disk, h a d been largely a n intuitive idea on the dreamer's mental horizon, but nowin thedream it shifts its p o s i t i o n a n d b e c o m e s t h e c e n t e r o f the landscape of her soul. A seed, sown long ago, begins to sprout: for a long time previously the d r e a m e r h a d paid careful attention to her d r e a m s , a n d n o w this w o r k bears fruit. ( O n e is r e m i n d e d of t h e r e l a t i o n b e t w e e n t h e symbol of the G r e a t M a n a n d p l a n t life, which
I mentioned before.) N o w the golden disk suddenly moves to the "right" side — the side where things become conscious. Among other things "right" often means, psychologically, the side of consciousness, of adaptation, of being "right," while "left" signifies the sphere of u n a d a p t e d , unconscious reactions or sometimes even of something "sinister." T h e n , finally, the golden disk stops its m o v e m e n t a n d comes to rest on significantly —a round stone table. It has found a permanent base.
As Aniela Jaffe observes later in this book, roundness (the mandala motif) generally symbolizes a natural wholeness, whereas a quadrangular formation represents the realization of this in consciousness. In the dream the square disk and the round table meet, and thus a conscious r e a l i z a t i o n of t h e c e n t e r is a t h a n d . T h e r o u n d t a b l e , i n c i d e n t a l l y , is a w e l l - k n o w n s y m bol of w h o l e n e s s a n d p l a y s a i-ole in m y t h o l o g y — for instance, K i n g Arthur's round table, w h i c h itself is a n i m a g e d e r i v e d from t h e t a b l e of the Last Supper.
In fact, whenever a h u m a n being genuinely turns to the inner world and tries to know himself— n o t by r u m i n a t i n g a b o u t his s u b j e c t i v e thoughts and feelings, but by following the expressions of his o w n objective nature such as dreams and genuine fantasies —then sooner or l a t e r t h e S e l f e m e r g e s . T h e e g o w i l l t h e n find an inner power that contains all the possibilities of renewal.
In the paintings, left, of the dream quoted on this page (painted by the dreamer), the mandala motif appears as a quadrangle rather than a circle Usually quadrangular forms symbolize conscious realization of inner w h o l e n e s s : the w h o l e n e s s itself is most often represented in circular forms, such as the round table that also appears in the dream. Right, the legendary Round Table of King Arthur (from a 15th-century manuscript), at w h i c h the Holy Grail appeared in a vision and started the knights on the famous quest. The Grail itself symbolizes the inner wholeness for which men have always been searching.



But t h e r e is a g r e a t difficulty t h a t I h a v e m e n t i o n e d only i n d i r e c t l y u p till n o w . T h i s is that every personification of the unconscious the shadow, the anima, the animus, and the Self —has both a light and a dark aspect. We saw before that the shadow may be base or evil, an instinctive drive that one ought to overcome. It may, however, be an impulse toward growth that one should cultivate and follow. In the same way the anima and animus have dual aspects: They can bring life-giving development and creativeness to the personality, or they can cause petrification and physical death. And even the Self, the a l l - e m b r a c i n g symbol of the unconscious, has an a m b i v a l e n t effect, as for instance in the Eskimo tale (page 196), when the "little w o m a n " offered to save the heroine from the Moon Spirit but actually turned her into a spider.
T h e d a r k side of t h e Self is t h e most d a n gerous thing of all, precisely because the Self is t h e g r e a t e s t p o w e r in t h e p s y c h e . It c a n cause people to "spin" megalomaniac or other delusory fantasies that catch them up and "possess" them. A person in this state thinks with mounting excitement that he has grasped and solved the great cosmic riddles; he therefore loses all touch with h u m a n reality. A reliable s y m p t o m of this c o n d i t i o n is t h e loss of one's sense of h u m o r and of h u m a n contacts.
T h u s the emerging of the Self m a y bring great d a n g e r to a man's conscious ego. T h e d o u b l e a s p e c t of t h e Self is b e a u t i f u l l y illustrated by this old Iranian fairy tale, called " T h e Secret of the Bath B a d g e r d " :
The great and noble Prince Hatim Tai receives orders from his king to investigate the mysterious Bath Badgerd [castle of nonexistence]. When he approaches it, having gone through many dangerous adventures, he hears that nobody ever ret u r n e d from it, b u t he insists on g o i n g on. He is received at a round building by a barber with a mirror who leads him into the bath, but as soon as the prince enters the water, a thunderous noise b r e a k s o u t . it gets c o m p l e t e l y d a r k , the b a r b e r disappears, and slowly the water begins to rise. Hatim swims desperately round until the water finally reaches the top of the round cupola, which forms t h e roof of t h e b a t h . N o w he fears he is lost, but he says a prayer and grabs the centerstone of the cupola. Again a thunderous noise, everything changes, and Hatim stands alone in a desert. After long and painful wandering, he comes to a beautiful g a r d e n in t h e m i d d l e of w h i c h is a circle of stone statues. In the center of the statues, he sees a parrot in its cage, and a voice from above says to h i m : " O h , hero, you probably will not escape alive from this bath. Once Gayomart [the First Man] found an enormous diamond that shone more brightly than sun and moon. He decided to h i d e it w h e r e n o o n e c a n find it, a n d therefore he built this magical bath in order to



protect it. T h e parrot that you see here forms part of the magic. At its feet lie a golden bow and arrow on a golden chain, and with them you may try three times to shoot the parrot. If you hit him the curse will be lifted; if not, you will be petrified, as were all these other people." H a t i m tries once, and fails. His legs turn to stone. H e fails o n c e m o r e a n d is petrified u p to his chest. T h e third time he just shuts his eyes, e x c l a i m i n g " G o d is g r e a t , " shoots b l i n d l y , a n d this time hits the parrot. An outbreak of thunder, clouds of dust. When all this has subsided, in place of the p a r r o t is a n e n o r m o u s , beautiful d i a m o n d , a n d all the statues h a v e come to life again. T h e people thank him for their redemption.
T h e reader will recognize the symbols of the Self in this story- the First M a n G a y o m a r t , the round mandala-shaped building, the centers t o n e , a n d t h e d i a m o n d . But this d i a m o n d is surrounded by danger. The demonic parrot signifies the evil spirit of imitation that makes one miss the target and petrify psychologically. As I pointed out earlier, the process of individuation excludes any parrot-like imitation of others. T i m e a n d again in all countries people have tried to copy in "outer" or ritualistic behavior the original religious experience of their great religious teachers Christ or Buddha or some other master —and have therefore become "petrified." T o follow in the steps of a great spiritual leader does not mean that one should
copy and act out the pattern of the individuation process m a d e by his life. It m e a n s that we should try with a sincerity and devotion equal to his to live our own lives. The barber with the mirror, who vanishes, symbolizes the gift of reflection that H a t i m loses w h e n he w a n t s it m o s t ; the rising w a t e r s represent the risk that one m a y drown in the unconscious a n d get lost in one's o w n emotions. In order to understand the symbolic indications of the unconscious, one must be careful not to get outside oneself or "beside oneself," but to stay e m o t i o n a l l y w i t h i n oneself. I n d e e d , it is vitally important that the ego should continue to f u n c t i o n in n o r m a l w a y s . O n l y if I r e m a i n an ordinary h u m a n being, conscious of my incompleteness, can I become receptive to the significant contents and processes of the unconscious. But how can a h u m a n being stand the tension ol feeling himself at o n e with the whole u n i v e r s e , w h i l e at t h e s a m e t i m e he is o n l y a m i s e r a b l e e a r t h l y h u m a n c r e a t u r e ? If, o n t h e one hand, I despise myself as merely a statistical c i p h e r , m y life h a s n o m e a n i n g a n d is not w o r t h l i v i n g . B u t if, o n t h e o t h e r h a n d , I feel m y s e l f to be part of something much greater, how a m I to k e e p m y feet o n t h e g r o u n d ? It is v e r y difficult indeed to keep these inner opposites united within oneself without toppling over into one or the other extreme.

The social aspect of the Self
T o d a y the enormous growth of population, especially obvious in large cities, inevitably has a depressing effect on us. W e think, " O h , well, I am only so-and-so living at such-and-such an address, like thousands of other people. If a few of t h e m get killed, w h a t difference can it m a k e ? T h e r e are far too m a n y people in any case." And when we read in the paper about the deaths of i n n u m e r a b l e u n k n o w n people w h o personally mean nothing to us, the feeling that o u r lives c o u n t for n o t h i n g is f u r t h e r i n c r e a s e d . T h i s is t h e m o m e n t w h e n a t t e n t i o n to t h e u n conscious brings the greatest help, for d r e a m s s h o w t h e d r e a m e r h o w e a c h d e t a i l of his life is interwoven with the most significant realities.
W h a t we all know theoretically — that every thing depends on the individual — becomes through d r e a m s a palpable fact that everyone c a n experience for himself. S o m e t i m e s w e h a v e a strong feeling that the Great M a n wants something from us and has set us very special tasks. O u r response to this experience can help us to acquire the strength to swim against the stream of collective prejudice by taking our own soul seriously into account.
N a t u r a l l y this is n o t a l w a y s a n a g r e e a b l e task. For instance, you want to make a trip with
friends next S u n d a y ; then a d r e a m forbids it and demands that you do some creative work instead. If you listen to your unconscious and obey it, you must expect constant interference w i t h y o u r conscious p l a n s . Y o u r will is crossed by other intentions — intentions that you must submit to, or at any rate must seriously consider. T h i s is p a r t l y w h y t h e o b l i g a t i o n a t t a c h e d to t h e p r o c e s s of i n d i v i d u a t i o n is often felt to be a burden rather than an immediate blessing.
St. Christopher, the patron of all travelers, is a fitting s y m b o l for t h i s e x p e r i e n c e . A c c o r d i n g to the legend, he felt an a r r o g a n t pride in his tremendous physical strength, and was willing to serve only the strongest. First he served a king; but when he saw that the king feared the devil, h e left h i m a n d b e c a m e the devil's servant. Then one day he discovered that the devil feared the crucifix, and so he decided to s e r v e C h r i s t if h e c o u l d find h i m . H e f o l l o w e d the advice of a priest w h o told h i m to wait for Christ at a ford. In the years that passed he carried many people across the river. But once, on a dark, stormy night, a small child called out that he wanted to be carried over the river. W i t h the greatest ease, St. Christopher lifted the child on to his shoulders, but he walked



The achievement of psychological maturity is an individual t a s k and so is increasingly difficult today w h e n m a n ' s individuality is threatened by widespread conformity. Far left, a British h o u s i n g d e v e l o p m e n t with its stereotyped dwellings; left, a Swiss athletics display provides an image of mass regimentation.
m o r e slowly with every step, for his b u r d e n became heavier and heavier. W h e n he arrived in m i d s t r e a m , h e felt " a s if h e c a r r i e d the w h o l e universe." He realized then that he had taken Christ upon his shoulders — and Christ gave h i m remission of his sins a n d eternal life.
T h i s m i r a c u l o u s c h i l d is a s y m b o l of t h e Self that literally "depresses" the ordinary h u m a n b e i n g , e v e n t h o u g h it is t h e o n l y t h i n g t h a t c a n redeem him. In m a n y works of art the Christ child is d e p i c t e d as, or w i t h , t h e s p h e r e of t h e w o r l d , a motif t h a t clearly d e n o t e s the Self, for a child and a sphere are both universal symbols of totality.
W h e n a person tries to obey the unconscious, he will often, as we have seen, be unable to do just as he pleases. But equally he will often be unable to do what other people want him to do. It often happens, for instance, that he must separate from his group — from his family, his partner, or other personal connections—in o r d e r t o find h i m s e l f . T h a t is w h y it is s o m e t i m e s said that attending to the unconscious makes people antisocial and egocentric. As a rule this is n o t t r u e , for t h e r e is a l i t t l e - k n o w n factor t h a t enters into this attitude: the collective (or, we could even say, social) aspect of the Self.
Above, a page from William Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience, in w h i c h the poems reveal Blake's concept of the "divine c h i l d " — a well-known symbol of the Self. Right, a 16th-century painting of St. Christopher carrying Christ as a d i v i n e c h i l d ( w h o is e n c i r c l e d by a world s p h e r e — a mandala and a symbol of the Self). This burden symbolizes the "weight" of the task of i n d i v i d u a t i o n — j u s t as St. Christopher's role as the patron of travelers (far right, a St. Christopher medallion on a car's ignition key) reflects his link with man's need to travel the path to psychological wholeness.



From a practical angle this factor reveals itself in that an individual w h o follows his d r e a m s for a considerable time will find that they are often concerned with his relationships with other people. His dreams may warn him against trusting a certain person too much, or he may dream about a favorable and agreeable meeting with someone whom he may previously have never consciously noticed. If a d r e a m does p i c k u p t h e i m a g e of a n o t h e r p e r s o n for us i n some such fashion, there are two possible interpretations. First, the figure may be a projection, which means that the dream-image of this person is a s y m b o l for a n i n n e r a s p e c t of t h e d r e a m e r himself. O n e d r e a m s , for instance, of a d i s h o n e s t n e i g h b o r , b u t t h e n e i g h b o r is u s e d by the d r e a m as a picture of one's own dish o n e s t y . It is t h e task of d r e a m i n t e r p r e t a t i o n t o find o u t i n w h i c h s p e c i a l a r e a s o n e ' s o w n d i s h o n e s t y c o m e s i n t o p l a y . ( T h i s is c a l l e d dream interpretation on the subjective level.)
But it also h a p p e n s at times that d r e a m s genuinely tell us something about other people. In this w a y , t h e u n c o n s c i o u s p l a y s a role t h a t is far from being fully understood. Like all the h i g h e r forms of life, m a n is in t u n e w i t h t h e living beings around him to a remarkable degree. He perceives their sufferings and problems, their positive and negative attributes and values, instinctively — quite independently of his conscious thoughts about other people.
O u r d r e a m life allows us to h a v e a look at these subliminal perceptions and shows us that they have an effect u p o n us. After having an agreeable dream about somebody, even without interpreting the dream, I shall involuntarily look at that person with more interest. T h e dream image may have deluded me, because of m y projections; or it m a y h a v e given m e o b j e c t i v e i n f o r m a t i o n . T o find o u t w h i c h is t h e

The psychological balance and unity that man needs today have been symbolized in many modern dreams by the union of the French girl and the Japanese man in the widely p o p u l a r F r e n c h f i l m Hiroshima Mon Amour (1 9 5 9 ) , a b o v e A n d in t h e same dreams, the opposite extreme from wholeness (i.e. complete psychological dissociation, or madness) has been symbolized by a related 20th-century i m a g e a nuclear explosion (right).
correct interpretation requires an honest, attentive a t t i t u d e a n d careful t h o u g h t . But, as is the case with all inner processes, it is ultimately the Self that orders and regulates one's h u m a n relationships, so long as the conscious ego lakes the trouble to detect the delusive projections and deals with these inside himself instead of outside. It is in this way that spiritually a t t u n e d and similarly o r i e n t e d p e o p l e find t h e i r w a y to one another, to create a group that cuts across all the usual social and organizational affiliations of p e o p l e . S u c h a g r o u p is not in conflict with o t h e r s ; it is m e r e l y different a n d i n d e pendent. T h e consciously realized process of individuation thus changes a person's relationships. The familiar bonds such as kinship or common interests are replaced by a different type of unity — a bond t h r o u g h the Self.
All activities and obligations that belong exclusively to the outer world do definite harm to the secret activities of the unconscious. Through these unconscious ties those who belong together c o m e together. T h a t is o n e reason why attempts to influence people by advertisements and political propaganda are destructive, even when inspired by idealistic motives. This raises the important question of whether the unconscious part of the h u m a n psyche can
be influenced at all. Practical experience and accurate observation show that one cannot influence o n e ' s o w n d r e a m s . T h e r e a r e p e o p l e , it is true, w h o assert t h a t they can influence t h e m . But if you look into their d r e a m material, you find t h a t they d o only w h a t I d o with m y disobedient dog; I order him to do those things I notice he wants to do anyhow, so that I can preserve my illusion of authority. Only a long process of interpreting one's dreams and confronting oneself with what they have to say can gradually transform the unconscious. And conscious attitudes also must change in this process. If a man who wants to influence public opinion misuses symbols for this purpose, they will naturally impress the masses in so far as they are true symbols, but whether or not the mass unconscious will be emotionally gripped by t h e m is s o m e t h i n g that c a n n o t be c a l c u l a t e d in advance, something that remains completely irrational. No music publisher, for instance, can tell in advance whether a song will become a hit or not, even t h o u g h it m a y d r a w on p o p u l a r images and melodies. No deliberate attempts to influence the unconscious have yet produced any significant results, and it seems that the mass unconscious preserves its autonomy just as much as the individual unconscious.
22 I



At times, in order to express its purposes, the unconscious may use a motif from our external world and thus may seem to have been influenced by it. For instance, I have come across many dreams of modern people that have to do with Berlin. In these dreams Berlin stands as a symbol of the psychic weak spot—the place of d a n g e r — a n d for this reason is the p l a c e w h e r e the Self is a p t to a p p e a r . It is the point w h e r e the d r e a m e r is torn by conflict and where he might, therefore, be able to unite the inner opposites. I have also encountered an extraordinary number of dream reactions to the film Hiroshima Mon Amour. I n most of these dreams the idea was expressed that either the two lovers in the film m u s t u n i t e (which symbolizes the union of inner opposites) or there would be an atomic explosion (a symbol of complete dissociation, equivalent to madness).
Only when the manipulators of public opinion add commercial pressure or acts of violence to their activities do they seem to achieve a temporary success. But in fact this merely causes a repression of the genuine unconscious reactions. And mass repression leads to the same result as individual repression; that is, to neurotic dissociation and psychological illness. All such attempts to repress the reactions of the unconscious must fail in the long r u n , for they are basically opposed to our instincts.
We know from studying the social behavior of the higher animals that small groups (from a p p r o x i m a t e l y 10 to 50 individuals) create the
As in the dream q u o t e d on p. 2 2 3 , positive anima figures often assist and guide men. Top of page, from a 10th-century psalter, David inspired by the muse.

best possible living conditions for the single animal as well as for the group, and m a n seems to be no exception in this respect. His physical well-being, his spiritual psychic health, and, beyond the animal realm, his cultural efficiency seem to flourish best in such a social function. As far as we at present understand the process of individuation, the Self apparently tends to produce such small groups by creating at the same time sharply defined ties of feeling between certain individuals and feelings of relatedness to all people. O n l y if these c o n n e c t i o n s are created by the Self can one feel any assura n c e t h a t e n v y , j e a l o u s y , fighting, a n d all m a n ner of negative projections will not break up the group. Thus an unconditional devotion to one's own process of individuation also brings about the best possible adaptation.
This does not mean, of course, that there will not be collisions of opinion and conflicting obligations, or disagreement about the "right" way. in the face of which one must constantly withdraw and listen to one's inner voice in order to find the individual standpoint that the Self intends one to have. Fanatical political activity (but not the performance of essential duties) seems somehowincompatible with individuation. A man who devoted himself entirely to freeing his country from foreign occupation had this dream:
With some of my compatriots I go up a stairway to the attic of a museum, where there is a
hall painted black and looking like a cabin on a ship. A distinguished-looking middle-aged lady opens the door; her name is X, daughter of X. [X was a famous national hero of the dreamer's country who attempted some centuries ago to free it. He might be compared to J o a n of Arc or William Tell. In reality X had no children.] In the hall we see the portraits of two aristocratic ladies dressed in flowery brocaded garments. While Miss X is explaining these pictures to us, they suddenly come to life; first the eyes begin to live, and then the chest seems to breathe. People are surprised and go to a lecture room where Miss X will speak to them about the phenomenon. She says that through her intuition and feeling these portraits came alive; but some of the people are indignant and say that Miss X is m a d ; some even leave the lecture room. T h e i m p o r t a n t feature of this d r e a m is t h a t the a n i m a figure, Miss X , is p u r e l y a c r e a t i o n of the dream. She has, however, the name of a famous national hero-liberator (as if she were, for instance. W i l h e l m i n a Tell, the d a u g h t e r of William Tell). By the implications contained in the n a m e , the unconscious is pointing to the fact that today the dreamer should not try, as X did long ago, to free his country in an outer w a y . N o w , the d r e a m says, liberation is a c c o m plished by the anima (by the dreamer's soul), who accomplishes it by bringing the images of the unconscious to life.
T h a t the hall in the attic of the museum looks p a r t l y like a ship's c a b i n p a i n t e d black is very meaningful. The black color hints at darkness, night, a t u r n i n g i n w a r d , a n d if the hall is
223



a c a b i n , t h e n the m u s e u m is s o m e h o w also a ship. This suggests that when the mainland of collective consciousness b e c o m e s flooded by u n consciousness and barbarism, this museum-ship, filled w i t h living i m a g e s , m a y t u r n i n t o a saving ark that will carry those who enter it to another spiritual shore. Portraits hanging in a museum are usually the dead remains of the past, and often the images of the unconscious are regarded in the same way until we discover that they are alive and meaningful. When the anima (who appears here in her rightful role of soulguide) contemplates the images with intuition and feeling, they begin to live.
The indignant people in the dream represent the side of the d r e a m e r t h a t is influenced by collective opinion—something in him that distrusts a n d rejects the bringing to life of psychic images. They personify a resistance to the unconscious that might express itself something like this: "But w h a t if they begin d r o p p i n g atom bombs on us? Psychological insight won't be much help then!"
T h i s resistant side is u n a b l e to free itself from statistical thinking and from extraverted rational prejudices. The dream, however, points out that in our time genuine liberation can start only with a psychological transformation. To w h a t end does one liberate one's c o u n t r y if afterward t h e r e is no m e a n i n g f u l goal of l i f e no .goal for which it is worthwhile to be free? If m a n n o l o n g e r finds a n y m e a n i n g in his life, it makes no difference whether he wastes away under a Communist or a capitalist regime. Only if he can use his freedom to create something meaningful is it r e l e v a n t t h a t he should be free. T h a t is w h y finding the i n n e r m e a n i n g of life is more i m p o r t a n t to the individual t h a n anything else, and why the process of individuation must be given priority.
Attempts to influence public opinion by means of newspapers, radio, television, and advertising are based on two factors. On the one hand, they rely on sampling techniques that reveal the trend of "opinion" or "wants"- -that is, of collective attitudes. O n the other, they express prejudices, projections, and unconscious complexes (mainly the power complex)
of those who manipulate public opinion. But statistics do no justice to the individual. Although the average size of stones in a heap m a y b e five c e n t i m e t e r s , o n e will find very few stones of exactly this size in the heap. That the second factor cannot create anything positive is clear from the start. But if a single individual devotes himself to individuation, he frequently has a positive contagious effect on the people a r o u n d him. It is as if a spark leaps from one to another. And this usually occurs when one has no intention of influencing others and often when one uses no words. It is o n t o this i n n e r p a t h t h a t Miss X tried to lead the dreamer. Nearly all religious systems on our planet contain images that symbolize the process of individuation, or at least some stages of it. In C h r i s t i a n countries the Self is projected, as I said before, onto the second A d a m : Christ. In the East the relevant figures are those of Krishna and Buddha. For people who are contained in a religion (that is, who still really believe in its content and teachings), the psychological regulation of their lives is effected by religious symbols, a n d even their dreams often revolve around them. When the late Pope Pius XII issued the declaration of the Assumption of Mary, a Catholic w o m a n d r e a m e d , for instance, that she was a Catholic priestess. Her unconscious seemed to e x t e n d the d o g m a in this w a y : " I f M a r y is now almost a goddess, she should have priestesses." Another Catholic woman, who had resistances to some of the minor and outer aspects of her creed, d r e a m e d that the church of her home city had been pulled down and rebuilt, but that the tabernacle with the consecrated host and the statue of the Virgin Mary were to be transferred from the old to the new church. The d r e a m showed her that some of the m a n - m a d e aspects of her religion needed renewal, but that its basic symbols — Cod's having become Man, and the Great Mother, the Virgin Marywould survive the change.
Such dreams demonstrate the living interest that the unconscious takes in the conscious religious representations of an individual. This

raises the q u e s t i o n w h e t h e r it is possible to d e tect a general trend in all the religious dreams of contemporary people. In the manifestations of the unconscious found in o u r m o d e r n Christian culture, whether Protestant or Catholic, Dr. J u n g often observed t h a t t h e r e is a n unconscious tendency at work to round off our trinitarian formula of the Godhead with a fourth element, which tends to be feminine, dark, and even evil. Actually this fourth element has always existed in the realm of our religious representations, but it was separated from the image of God and became his counterpart, in the form of matter itself (or the lord of m a t t e r —i.e. the devil). N o w the unconscious seems to want to reunite these extremes, the light having become too bright and the darkness too somber. N a t u r a l l y it is the central symbol of religion, the image of the Godhead, that is most exposed to u n c o n s c i o u s t e n d e n c i e s toward transformation.
A Tibetan abbot once told Dr. J u n g that the most impressive mandalas in Tibet are built up by imagination, or directed fantasy, when the psychological b a l a n c e of the g r o u p is d i s t u r b e d or when a particular thought cannot be rendered because it is not yet c o n t a i n e d 1n the sacred doctrine and must therefore be searched for. In these remarks, two equally i m p o r t a n t basic aspects of mandala symbolism emerge. The mandala serves a conservative p u r p o s e namely, to restore a previously existing order.
But it also serves the c r e a t i v e p u r p o s e of giving expression and form to something that does not yet exist, something new and unique. The second aspect is p e r h a p s even m o r e i m p o r t a n t t h a n the first, b u t does not c o n t r a d i c t it. For, in most cases, what restores the old order simultaneously involves some element of new creation. In the new order the older pattern returns on a h i g h e r level. T h e process is t h a t of the ascending spiral, which grows upward while simultaneously returning again and again to the same point. A painting by a simple woman who was brought up in Protestant surroundings shows a mandala in the form of a spiral. In a dream this woman received an order to paint the Godhead. Later (also in a dream) she saw it in a book. Of God himself she saw only his wafting cloak, the drapery of which made a beautiful display of light and shadow. This contrasted impressively with the stability of the spiral in the deep blue sky. Fascinated by the cloak and the .spiral, the dreamer did not look closely at the o t h e r figure on the rocks. W h e n she a w o k e a n d t h o u g h t a b o u t w h o these d i v i n e figures were, she suddenly realized that it was " G o d himself." This gave her a frightful shock, which she felt for a long time.

The Catholic Church's dogma of the Assumption of the Virgin — in w h i c h Mary, as domina rerum. Q u e e n o f N a t u r e , w a s declared to have entered heaven with soul and body reunited—can be said to have made the Trinity fourfold, corresponding with the basic archetype of completeness
which has spontaneously arisen from the unconscious. T h a t t h e H o l y G h o s t is the p o w e r that works for the further development of our religious u n d e r s t a n d i n g is not a new idea, of course, but its symbolic representation in the form of a spiral is n e w . The same woman then painted a second picture, also inspired by a dream, showing the dreamer with her positive animus standing above Jerusalem when the wing of Satan descends to darken the city. The satanic wing strongly reminded her of the wafting cloak of G o d in the first p a i n t i n g , b u t in the former d r e a m the s p e c t a t o r is high u p , s o m e w h e r e in heaven, and sees in front of her a terrific split between the rocks. T h e movement in the cloak of G o d is a n a t t e m p t to r e a c h C h r i s t , the figure on the right, but it does not q u i t e succeed. In the second p a i n t i n g , the s a m e t h i n g is seen from below from a h u m a n a n g l e .

But seen from the basis of our human reality, this s a m e t h i n g in the air is the d a r k , uncanny wing of the devil.
In the d r e a m e r ' s life these two pictures became real in a way that does not concern us h e r e , b u t it is o b v i o u s t h a t they also c o n t a i n a collective meaning that reaches beyond the personal. They may prophesy the descent of a divine darkness upon the Christian hemisphere, a darkness that points, however, toward the possibility of further evolution. Since the axis of the spiral does not move upward but into the background of the picture, the further evolution will lead neither to greater spiritual height nor down into the realm of matter, but to another dimension, probably into the backg r o u n d of these divine figures. A n d that m e a n s into the unconscious.
W h e n religious symbols that a r e partly different from those we know emerge from the unconscious of a n i n d i v i d u a l , it is often feared that these will wrongfully alter or diminish the officially recognized religious symbols. This fear even causes many people to reject analytical psychology and the entire unconscious.

II I look at such a resistance from a psychological point of view, I should have to comment t h a t as far as religion is c o n c e r n e d , human beings can be divided into three types. First, there are those who still genuinely believe their religious doctrines, whatever they may be. For these people, the symbols and doctrines "click" so satisfyingly with w h a t they feel d e e p inside themselves that serious doubts have no chance to sneak in. This happens when the views of consciousness and the unconscious background are in relative harmony. People of this sort can afford to look at new psychological discoveries and facts without prejudice and need not fear that they may be caused to lose their faith. Even if their d r e a m s should bring up some relatively unorthodox details, these can be integrated into their general view.
The second type consists of those people who have completely lost their faith and have replaced it with purely conscious, rational opinions. For these people, depth psychology simply means an introduction into newly discovered areas of the psyche, and it should cause no trouble when they embark on the new adventure and investigate their dreams to test the truth of them. T h e n there is a t h i r d g r o u p of people w h o in one part of themselves (probably the head) no longer believe in their religious traditions,
whereas in some other part they still do believe. The French p h i l o s o p h e r Voltaire is an illustration of this. He violently attacked the Catholic C h u r c h with r a t i o n a l a r g u m e n t (ecrasez I'infdme), b u t on his d e a t h b e d , a c c o r d i n g to some reports, he begged for e x t r e m e unction. W h e t h e r this is true or not, his h e a d was certainly unreligious, whereas his feelings and emotions seem still to have been orthodox. Such people remind one of a person getting stuck in the automatic doors of a bus; he can neither get out into free space nor re-enter the bus. O f course the dreams of such persons could probably help them out of their dilemma, but such people frequently have trouble turning toward the unconscious because they themselves do not know what they think and want. To take the u n c o n s c i o u s seriously is u l t i m a t e l y a m a t t e r of personal courage and integrity.
The complicated situation of those who are caught in a no-man's-land between the two states of m i n d is p a r t l y c r e a t e d by the fact that all official religious doctrines actually belong to the collective consciousness (what Freud called the super-ego); but once, long ago, they sprang from the u n c o n s c i o u s . T h i s is a p o i n t t h a t m a n y historians of religion and theologians challenge. They choose to assume that there was once some sort of "revelation." I have searched for m a n y years for concrete evidence for the J u n
Paintings of the dreams discussed on pp. 225-6: Left, the spiral (a form of mandala) represents the Holy Ghost; right, the dark wing of Satan, from the second dream Neither motif would be a familiar religious symbol to most people (nor were they to the dreamer): Each emerged spontaneously from the unconscious.



gian hypothesis about this problem; but it has been difficult to find because most rituals are so old that one cannot trace their origin. T h e following example, however, seems to me to offer a most i m p o r t a n t clue: Black Elk, a medicine m a n of the Oglala Sioux, who died not long ago, tells us in his a u t o b i o g r a p h y Black Elk Speaks t h a t , w h e n he was nine years old, he became seriously ill and during a sort of coma had a tremendous vision. He saw four groups of beautiful horses coming from the four corners of the world, and then, seated within a cloud, he saw the Six Grandfathers, the ancestral spirits of his tribe, "the grandfathers of the whole world." T h e y gave him six healing symbols for his people and showed him new ways of life. But when he was 16 years old, he s u d d e n l y d e v e l o p e d a terrible phobia whenever a thunder storm was approaching, because he heard "thunder beings" calling to him "to make haste." It reminded him of the thundering noise m a d e by the approaching horses in his vision. An old medicine man explained to him that his fear came from the fact that he was keeping his vision to himself, a n d said t h a t he m u s t tell it to his tribe. He did so, and later he and his people acted out the vision in a ritual, using real horses. Not merely Black Elk himself, but many other members of his tribe felt infinitely better after this play. Some were even cured of their diseases. Black Elk said: "Even the horses seemed to be healthier and happier after the dance."
The ritual was not repeated because the tribe was destroyed soon a f t e r w a r d . But here is a different case in which a ritual still survives. Several Eskimo tribes living near the Colville River in Alaska explain the origin of their eagle festival in the following way:
A young hunter shot dead a very unusual eagle and was so impressed by the beauty of the dead bird that he stuffed and made a fetish of him, honoring him by sacrifices. One day, when the hunter had traveled far inland during his hunting, two animal-men suddenly appeared in the role of messengers and led him to the land of the eagles. There he heard a dark drumming noise,
and the messengers explained that this was the heartbeat of the dead eagle's mother. Then the eagle spirit appeared to the hunter as a woman clothed in black. She asked him to initiate an eagle festival among his people to honor her dead son. After the eagle people had shown him how to do this, he suddenly found himself, exhausted, back in the place where he had met the messengers. Returning home, he taught his people how to perform the great eagle festival—as they have done faithfully ever since.
From such examples we see how a ritual or religious custom can spring directly from an unconscious revelation experienced by a single individual. O u t of such beginnings, people living in cultural groups develop their various religious activities with their enormous influence on the entire life of the society. D u r i n g a long process of evolution the original material is s h a p e d a n d r e s h a p e d by w o r d s a n d actions, is beautified, and acquires increasingly definite forms. This crystallizing process, however, has a great disadvantage. More and more people have no personal knowledge of the original experience and can only believe what their elders and teachers tell them about it. They no longer know that such happenings are real, and they are of course ignorant about how one feels during the experience.
In their present forms, worked over and exceedingly aged, such religious traditions often resist further creative alterations by the unconscious. Theologians sometimes even defend these "true" religious symbols and symbolic doctrines against the discovery of a religious function in the unconscious psyche, forgetting t h a t t h e values t h e y fight for o w e t h e i r existence to that very same function. Without a human psyche to receive divine inspirations and utter them in words or shape them in art, no religious symbol has ever come into the reality of our h u m a n life. (We need only think of the prophets and the evangelists.) If s o m e o n e objects t h a t t h e r e is a religious reality in itself, independent of the h u m a n psyche, I can only answer such a person with this question: " W h o says this, if not a h u m a n psyche?" No matter what we assert, we can

never get away from the existence of the psyche —for we a r e c o n t a i n e d w i t h i n it, a n d it is t h e only means by which we can grasp reality. Thus the modern discovery of the unconscious shuts one door forever. It definitely excludes the illusory idea, so favored by some individuals, that a man can know spiritual reality in itself. In m o d e r n physics, too, a door has been closed by Heisenberg's "principle of indeterminacy," shutting out the delusion that we can comprehend an absolute physical reality. T h e discovery of the unconscious, however, compensates for the loss of these beloved illusions by opening before us an immense and u n e x p l o r e d n e w field of r e a l i z a t i o n s , w i t h i n which objective scientific investigation combines in a strange new way with personal ethical adventure. But, as I said a t t h e outset, it is p r a c t i c a l l y impossible to impart the whole reality of one's e x p e r i e n c e in t h e n e w field. M u c h is u n i q u e and can be only partially c o m m u n i c a t e d by language. H e r e , too, a d o o r is shut against the
illusion that one can completely understand a n o t h e r p e r s o n a n d tell h i m w h a t is right for h i m . O n c e a g a i n , h o w e v e r , o n e c a n find a c o m p e n s a t i o n for this in the n e w r e a l m of e x p e r i ence by the discovery of the social function of the Self, which works in a h i d d e n way to unite separate individuals who belong together. I n t e l l e c t u a l c h i t - c h a t is t h u s r e p l a c e d bymeaningful events that occur in the reality of the psyche. Hence, for the individual to enter seriously into the process of individuation in the way that has been outlined means a completely new and different orientation toward life. For scientists it also means a new a n d different scientific approach to outer facts. H o w this will work o u t in t h e field of h u m a n k n o w l e d g e a n d in the social life of h u m a n beings c a n n o t b e predicted. But to me it seems certain that Jung's discovery of the process of individuation is a fact t h a t future g e n e r a t i o n s will h a v e to take into a c c o u n t if they w a n t to avoid drifting into a stagnant or even regressive outlook.
This painting (by Erhard Jacoby) illustrates the fact that each of us, perceiving the w o r l d t h r o u g h an i n d i v i d u a l psyche, perceives it in a slightly different w a y f r o m others The man, w o m a n , and child are l o o k i n g at the same scene; but, for each, different details become clear or obscured Only by means of our conscious perception does the world exist "outside": W e are surrounded by something completely unknown and unknowable (here represented by the painting's gray background)

Sacred symbols—the stone and the animal
The history of symbolism shows that everything can assume symbolic significance: natural objects (like stones, plants, animals, men, mountains and valleys, sun and moon, wind, water, a n d fire), or m a n - m a d e t h i n g s (like houses, boats, or cars), or even abstract forms (like numbers, or the triangle, the square, and the circle). I n fact, the w h o l e cosmos is a p o t e n t i a l symbol. Man, with his symbol-making propensity, unconsciously transforms objects or forms into symbols (thereby endowing them with great psychological importance) and expresses them in both his religion and his visual art. T h e intertwined history of religion and art, reaching back to p r e h i s t o r i c times, is t h e r e c o r d t h a t o u r a n c e s tors have left of the symbols that were m e a n ingful and moving to them. Even today, as modern painting and sculpture show, the interplay of religion a n d a r t is still alive. F o r t h e first p a r t of m y discussion of s y m bolism in the visual arts, I intend to examine some of the specific motifs that have been universally sacred or mysterious to man. T h e n , for the remainder of the chapter, I wish to discuss the phenomenon of 20th-century art, not in terms of its use of symbols, but in terms of its significance as a symbol itself—a s y m b o l i c expression of the psychological condition of the modern world. In the following pages, I have chosen three recurring motifs with which to illustrate the presence and nature of symbolism in the art of many different periods. These are the symbols of the stone, the animal, and the circle—each of which has had enduring psychological significance from t h e earliest expressions of h u m a n consciousness to the most sophisticated forms of 20th-century art. We know that even unhewn stones had a highly symbolic m e a n i n g for ancient and primitive societies. Rough, natural stones were often believed to be the dwelling places of spirits or gods, and were used in primitive cultures as

tombstones, boundary stones, or objects of religious veneration. Their use may be regarded as a p r i m e v a l form of s c u l p t u r e a first a t t e m p t to invest the stone with more expressive power than chance and nature could give it. T h e O l d T e s t a m e n t story of J a c o b ' s d r e a m is a typical example of how, thousands of years ago, m a n felt that a living god or a divine spirit was embodied in the stone and how the stone became a symbol:
And Jacob . . . went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of the place, and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven, and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And J a c o b rose up early in the morning and took the stone
that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Beth-el.
For J a c o b , the stone was an integral part of the revelation. It was the mediator between himself and God. In many primitive stone-sanctuaries, the deity is represented not by a single stone b u t by a great many unhewn stones, arranged in distinct patterns. (The geometrical stone alignments in Brittany and the stone circle at Stonehenge are famous examples.) Arrangements of rough natural stones also play a considerable part in the highly civilized rock gardens of Zen B u d d h i s m . T h e i r a r r a n g e m e n t is not geometrical but seems to have come about by pure c h a n c e . In fact, however, it is the expression of a most refined spirituality. Very early in history, men began trying to express what they felt to be the soul or spirit of a rock by working it into a recognizable form. In m a n y cases, the form was a more or less definite a p p r o x i m a t i o n to the h u m a n figure—for instance, the ancient menhirs with their crude outlines of faces, or the herms that developed out of boundary stones in ancient Greece, or the

Though apparently haphazard, the stones' arrangement in fact expresses a highly refined spirituality.

many primitive stone idols with human features. The animation of the stone must be explained as the projection of a more or less distinct content of the unconscious into the stone. The primitive tendency to give merely a hint of a h u m a n figure, a n d to r e t a i n m u c h of the stone's natural form, can also be seen in modern sculpture. Many examples show the artists" c o n c e r n w i t h the "self-expression" of 'tins t o n e ; to use the l a n g u a g e of m y t h , the stone is allowed to "speak for itself." This can be seen, for instance, in the work of the Swiss sculptor Hans Aeschbacher, the American sculptor James Rosati, and the German-born artist Max Ernst. In a letter from Maloja in 1935, Ernst wrote: "Alberto [the Swiss artist Giacometti] and I are afflicted with sculpturitis. We work on granite boulders, large and small, from the moraine of the Forno glacier. Wonderfully polished by time, frost, and weather, they are in themselves fantastically beautiful. No human hand can do that. So why not leave the spadework to the elements, and confine ourselves to s c r a t c h i n g on t h e m the runes of o u r o w n mystery?"
W h a t Ernst m e a n t by " m y s t e r y " is not explained. But later in this chapter I shall try to show that the "mysteries" of the modern artist are not very different from those of the old masters who knew the "spirit of the stone." T h e e m p h a s i s on t h i s " s p i r i t " in m u c h s c u l p ture is o n e i n d i c a t i o n of the shifting, indefinable
borderline between religion and art. Sometimes one cannot be separated from the other. The same ambivalence can also be seen in another symbolic motif, as it a p p e a r s in age-old works of art: the symbol of the animal. Animal pictures go back to the last Ice Age (between 60,000 and 10,000 B.C.). They were discovered on the walls of caves in France a n d Spain at the end of the last c e n t u r y , but it was not until early in the present century that archaeologists began to realize their extreme importance and to inquire into their meaning. These inquiries revealed an infinitely remote prehistoric culture whose existence had never even been suspected.
Even today, a strange music seems to haunt the caves that contain the rock engravings and paintings. According to the German art historian Herbert Kiihn, inhabitants of the areas in Africa, Spain, France, and Scandinavia where such paintings are found could not be induced to go near the caves. A kind of religious awe, or perhaps a fear of spirits hovering among the rocks and the paintings, held them back. Passing nomads still lay their votive offerings before the old rock paintings in North Africa. In the 1 5 t h c e n t u r y . P o p e Calixtus 11 p r o h i b i t e d religious ceremonies in the "cave with the horsep i c t u r e s . " W h i c h cave the p o p e m e a n t is not known, but there can be no doubt that it was a cave of the Ice Age containing animal pictures. All this goes to prove that the caves and rocks

Left, a drawing of a bison covered with arrow and spear marks: The cave dwellers believed that by ritually "killing" the image, they w o u l d be more likely to kill the animal.

with the animal paintings have always been instinctively felt to be w h a t they originally w e r e —religious places. T h e numen of the p l a c e has outlived the centuries. In a number of caves the modern visitor must travel through low, dark, and d a m p passages till he reaches the point where the great painted "chambers" suddenly open out. This arduous approach may express the desire of the primitive men to safeguard from common sight all that was contained and went on in the caves, and to protect their mystery. The sudden and unexpected sight of the paintings in the chambers, coming after the difficult and awe-inspiring approach, must have made an overwhelming impression on primitive man. The paleolithic cave paintings consist almost entirely of figures of a n i m a l s , whose m o v e m e n t s and postures have been observed in nature and rendered with great artistic skill. There are, h o w e v e r , m a n y details t h a t show t h a t t h e figures were intended to be something more than naturalistic reproductions. Kiihn writes: "The strange t h i n g is t h a t a good m a n y p r i m i t i v e paintings have been used as targets. At Montespan t h e r e is a n e n g r a v i n g of a horse t h a t is being d r i v e n into a t r a p ; it is pitted w i t h the marks of missiles. A clay model of a bear in the same cave has 42 holes."
These pictures suggest a hunting-magic like that still practiced today by hunting tribes in Africa. T h e painted animal has the function of
a " d o u b l e " ; by its symbolic slaughter, the hunters attempt to anticipate and ensure the d e a t h of the real a n i m a l . This is a form of symp a t h e t i c m a g i c , which is based on t h e " r e a l i t y " of a double represented in a picture: What happens to the picture will happen to the original. T h e underlying psychological fact is a strong identification between a living being a n d its i m a g e , which is considered to be the being's soul. (This is one reason w h y a great many primitive people today will shrink from being photographed.)
Other cave pictures must have served magic fertility rites. They show animals at the moment of mating; an example can be seen in the figures of a male and female bison in the T u c d'Audubert cave in France. Thus the realistic picture of the animals was enriched by overtones of magic and took on a symbolic significance. It became the image of the living essence of the animal. T h e most i n t e r e s t i n g figures in the cave paintings are those of semihuman beings in animal disguise, which are sometimes to be found besides the animals. In the Trois Freres cave in France, a man wrapped in an animal h i d e is p l a y i n g a p r i m i t i v e flute as if h e m e a n t to put a spell on the animals. In the same cave, t h e r e is a d a n c i n g h u m a n b e i n g , with antlers, a horse's h e a d , a n d b e a r ' s p a w s . T h i s figure, d o m i n a t i n g a m e d l e y of several h u n d r e d a n i m a l s , is unquestionably the "Lord of the Animals."
235



The customs and usages of some primitive African tribes today can throw some light on the meaning of these mysterious and doubtless symbolic figures. In initiations, secret societies, and even the institution of monarchy in these tribes, animals and animal disguises often play an important part. The king and chief are animals too—generally lions or leopards. Vestiges of this custom may be discerned in the title of the last emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie (Lion of J u d a h ) , or the honorific name of Dr. Hastings Banda (The Lion of Malawi).
The further back we go in time, or the more primitive and close to nature the society is, the more literally such titles must be taken. A primitive chief is not only disguised as the a n i m a l ; when he a p p e a r s at initiation rites in full a n i m a l disguise, he is the a n i m a l . Still m o r e , h e is a n animal spirit, a terrifying demon who performs circumcision. At such moments he incorporates or represents the ancestor of the tribe and the clan, and therefore the primal god himself. He represents, and is, the " t o t e m " animal. Thus we probably should not go far w r o n g in seeing in the figure of the d a n c i n g animal-man in the Trois Freres cave a kind of chief who has been transformed by his disguise into an animal demon.
In the course of time, the complete animal disguise was superseded in many places by animal and demon masks. Primitive men lavished
all their artistic skill on these masks, and many of them are still unsurpassed in the power and intensity of their expression. They are often the objects of the same veneration as the god or demon himself. Animal masks play a part in the folk arts of m a n y m o d e r n c o u n t r i e s , like Switzerland, or in the magnificently expressive masks of the a n c i e n t J a p a n e s e No d r a m a , w h i c h is still performed in modern J a p a n . T h e symbolic function of the mask is the s a m e as t h a t of the original animal disguise. Individual human expression is s u b m e r g e d , but in its p l a c e the wearer assumes the dignity and the beauty (and also the horrifying expression) of an animal demon. In psychological terms, the mask transforms its wearer into an archetypal image.
Dancing, which was originally nothing more than a completion of the animal disguise by appropriate movements and gestures, was probably supplementary to the initiation or other rites. It was, so to speak, performed by demons in h o n o r of a d e m o n . In the soft clay of the T u c d'Audubert cave, Herbert Kiihn found footp r i n t s t h a t led a r o u n d a n i m a l figures. T h e y show that dancing was part of even the Ice Age rites. "Only heel prints can be seen," Kiihn writes. " T h e dancers had moved like bisons. They had danced a bison dance for the fertility and increase of the animals and for their slaughter."

cation, between the native and his totem animal (or "bush-soul"). There are special ceremonies for the establishment of this relationship, especially the initiation rites for boys. T h e boy enters into possession of his "animal soul," and at the same time sacrifices his own "animal being" by circumcision. This dual process admits him to the totem clan and establishes his relationship to his totem animal. Above all, he becomes a man, and (in a still wider sense) a h u m a n being. East Coast Africans described the uncircumcised as "animals." They had neither received ah animal soul nor sacrificed their "animality." In other words, since neither the human nor the animal aspect of an uncircumcised boy's soul had become conscious, his animal aspect was regarded as dominant. T h e a n i m a l motif is usually symbolic of man's primitive and instinctual nature. Even civilized men must realize the violence of their instinctual drives and their powerlessness in face of the autonomous emotions erupting from the unconscious. T h i s is still m o r e the case with primitive m e n , whose consciousness is not highly developed and who are still less well equipped to w e a t h e r t h e e m o t i o n a l s t o r m . In the first c h a p t e r of this book, w h e n Dr. J u n g is discussing the ways in which man developed the p o w e r of reflection, h e takes a n e x a m p l e of a n African w h o fell into a rage a n d killed his beloved little son. When the man recovered
himself, he was overwhelmed with grief and remorse for w h a t he had done. In this case a negative impulse broke loose and did its deadly work regardless of the conscious will. T h e animal d e m o n is a highly expressive symbol for such an impulse. The vividness and concreteness of the image enables man to establish a relationship with it as a representative of the overwhelming power in himself. He fears it and seeks to propitiate it by sacrifice and ritual. A large number of myths are concerned with a primal animal, which must be sacrificed in the cause of fertility or even creation. O n e exa m p l e of this is the sacrifice of a bull by the Persian sun-god Mithras, from which sprang the earth with all wealth and fruitfulness. In the Christian legend of St. George slaying the dragon, the primeval rite of sacrificial slaughter again appears. In the religions and religious art of practically every race, animal attributes are ascribed to the supreme gods, or the gods are represented as animals. The ancient Babylonians translated their gods into the heavens in the shape of the R a m , the Bull, the Crab, the Lion, the S c o r p i o n , the Fish, a n d so o n — the signs of the Zodiac. The Egyptians represented the goddess Hathor as cow-headed, the god Amon as ram-headed, and Thoth as ibis-headed or in the shape of a baboon.

Greek m y t h o l o g y is full of a n i m a l s y m bolism. Zeus, the father of the gods, often approaches a girl whom he desires in the shape of a swan, a bull, or an eagle. In Germanic m y t h o l o g y , the cat is sacred to the goddess Freya, while the boar, the raven, and the horse are sacred to Wotan. Even in Christianity, animal symbolism plays a surprisingly great part. Three of the Evangelists have animal emblems: St. Euke has the ox, St. Mark the lion, and St. John the eagle. O n l y o n e , St. M a t t h e w , is r e p r e s e n t e d as a m a n or as an angel. Christ himself symbolically appears as the L a m b of God or the Fish, but he is also the s e r p e n t exalted on the cross, the lion, and in rarer cases the unicorn. These animal attributes of Christ indicate that even the Son of God (the supreme personification of man) can no more dispense with his animal nature than with his higher, spiritual nature. The subh u m a n as well as t h e s u p e r h u m a n is felt to belong to the realm of the divine; the relationship of these t w o aspects of m a n is beautifully symbolized in the Christmas picture of the birth of Christ, in a stable among animals.

merely emphasize the importance of the symbol ; it shows how vital it is for m e n to integrate into their lives the symbol's psychic content instinct. In itself, an a n i m a l is n e i t h e r good nor evil; it is a piece of n a t u r e . It c a n n o t desire a n y t h i n g that is n o t in its n a t u r e . T o p u t this a n o t h e r way, it obeys its instincts. These instincts often seem mysterious to us, but they have their parallel in h u m a n life: T h e foundation of h u m a n n a t u r e is instinct. But in man, the "animal being" (which lives in him as his instinctual psyche) may become d a n g e r o u s if it is not recognized a n d i n t e g r a t e d in life. M a n is the only c r e a t u r e with the p o w e r to control instinct by his o w n will, b u t he is also able to suppress, distort, and w o u n d it and an a n i m a l , tospeak metaphorically, is never so wild a n d d a n g e r o u s as w h e n it is w o u n d e d . S u p pressed instincts can gain control of a m a n ; they can even destroy him.
T h e familiar d r e a m in w h i c h the d r e a m e r is pursued by an animal nearly always indicates that an instinct has been split off from consciousness a n d o u g h t to be (or is t r y i n g to be) readmitted and integrated into life. T h e more dangerous the behavior of the animal in the d r e a m , the m o r e u n c o n s c i o u s is the p r i m i t i v e and instinctual soul of the dreamer, and the m o r e i m p e r a t i v e is its i n t e g r a t i o n i n t o his life if some i r r e p a r a b l e evil is to be forestalled. Suppressed and wounded instincts are the dangers threatening civilized man; uninhibited drives are the dangers threatening primitive m a n . In b o t h cases the " a n i m a l " is a l i e n a t e d from its true n a t u r e ; and for both, the accepta n c e of the a n i m a l soul is the c o n d i t i o n for wholeness and a fully lived life. Primitive m a n must tame the animal in himself and make it his helpful companion : civilized man must heal the a n i m a l in himself a n d m a k e it his friend. Other contributors to this book have discussed the importance of the stone and animal motifs in terms of d r e a m a n d m y t h ; I have used them here only as general examples of the appearance of such living symbols throughout the history of art ( a n d especially religious a r t ) . Let us n o w examine in the same way a most powerful and universal symbol: the circle.

The symbol of the circle
Dr. M.-E. von Franz has explained the circle (or sphere) as a symbol of the Self. It expresses the totality of the psyche in all its aspects, including the relationship between man and the whole of nature. Whether the symbol of the circle appears in primitive sun worship or modern religion, in myths or dreams, in the m a n d a l a s d r a w n by T i b e t a n monks, in the ground plans of cities, or in the spherical concepts of early a s t r o n o m e r s , it a l w a y s points to the single most vital aspect of life its u l t i m a t e wholeness.
An Indian creation myth relates that the god Brahma, standing on a huge, thousandpetaled lotus, turned his eyes to the four points of the compass. This fourfold survey from the circle of the lotus was a kind of preliminary orientation, an indispensable taking of bearings, before he began his work of creation. A similar story is told of B u d d h a . At the m o m e n t of his b i r t h , a lotus flower rose from the earth a n d he stepped into it to gaze into the 10 directions of space. (The lotus in this case was eight-rayed; and Buddha also gazed upward a n d d o w n w a r d , m a k i n g 10 directions.) T h i s symbolic gesture of survey was the most concise method of showing that from the moment of his birth, the Buddha was a unique personality, predestined to receive illumination. His personality and his further existence were given the imprint of wholeness.
The spatial orientation performed by Brahma and Buddha may be regarded as symbolic of the h u m a n need for psychic orientation. T h e four functions of consciousness described by Dr. Jung in his chapter, p. 61 thought, feeling, intuition, and sensation equip man to deal with the impressions of the world he receives from within a n d w i t h o u t . It is by m e a n s of these functions that he comprehends and assimilates his e x p e r i e n c e ; it is by m e a n s of t h e m that he can respond. Brahma's four-fold survey of the universe symbolizes the necessary integration of
these four functions that man must achieve. (In a r t , the circle is often e i g h t - r a y e d . T h i s expresses a reciprocal overlapping of the four functions of consciousness, so that four further intermediate functions come about — for instance, thought colored by feeling or intuition, or feeling tending toward sensation.) In the visual art of India and the Far East, the four- or eight-rayed circle is the usual p a t tern of the religious images that serve as instruments of meditation. In Tibetan Lamaism especially, richly figured m a n d a l a s play a n important part. As a rule, these mandalas represent the cosmos in its relation to divine powers. But a great many of the eastern meditation figures a r e p u r e l y g e o m e t r i c a l in d e s i g n ; these are calledyanlras. Aside from the circle, a very c o m m o n y a n t r a motif is formed by t w o interpenetrating triangles, one point-upward, the other point-downward. Traditionally, thisshape Symbolizes the union of Shiva and Shakti, the male and female divinities, a subject that also appears in sculpture in countless variations. In terms of psychological symbolism, it expresses the union of opposites — the union of the personal, temporal world of the ego with the non-personal, timeless world of the non-ego. U l t i m a t e l y , this union is the fulfillment a n d goal of all religions: It is the u n i o n of the soul with God. The two interpenetrating triangles have a symbolic meaning similar to that of the more

common circular mandala. They represent the wholeness of the psyche or Self, of which consciousness is just as m u c h a part as the unconscious. In both the triangle yantras and the sculptural representations of the union of Shiva and Shakti, the emphasis lies on a tension between the opposites. Hence the marked erotic and emotional character of many of them. This dynamic quality implies a process the creation, or coming into being, of wholeness — while the four- or eight-rayed circle represents wholeness as such, as an existing entity. T h e abstract circle also figures in Zen painting. S p e a k i n g of a p i c t u r e entitled The Circle, by the famous Zen priest Sangai, another Zen master writes: "In the Zen sect, the circle represents enlightenment. It symbolizes h u m a n perfection." Abstract mandalas also appear in European Christian art. Some of the most splendid examples are the rose windows of the cathedrals. These are representations of the Self of man transposed onto the cosmic plane. (A cosmic m a n d a l a in the shape of a shining white rose was revealed to Dante in a vision.) W e m a y regard as mandalas the haloes of Christ and the Christian saints in religious paintings. In m a n y cases, the halo of Christ is alone divided into lour, a significant allusion to his sufferings as the Son of M a n and his death on the Cross, and at the same time a symbol of his differentiated wholeness. On the walls of early Romanesque churches, abstract circular figures can sometimes be seen; they may go back to pagan originals.
In non-Christian art, such circles are called "sun wheels." They appear in rock engravings that date back to the neolithic epoch before the wheel was invented. As J u n g has pointed out, the term "sun wheel" denotes only the external aspect of the figure. What really mattered at all times was the experience of an archetypal.

Far right, the streets that meet at L'Etoile, Paris, to form a mandala
inner image, which Stone Age m a n rendered in his art as faithfully as he depicted bulls, gazelles, or wild horses. Many pictorial mandalas are to be found in Christian a r t : for e x a m p l e , the r a t h e r rare picture of the Virgin in the center of a circular tree, which is the G o d - s y m b o l of the b u r n i n g bush. The most widely current mandalas in Christian art are those of Christ surrounded by the four Evangelists. These go back to the ancient Egyptian representations of the god Horus and his four sons. In architecture the mandala also plays an important part but one that often passes unnoticed. It forms the ground plan of both secular and sacred buildings in nearly all civilizations; it enters into classical, medieval, and even modern town planning. A classical example appears in Plutarch's account of the foundation of R o m e . A c c o r d i n g to P l u t a r c h , R o m u l u s sent for builders from Etruria who instructed him by sacred usages and written rules about all the ceremonies to be observed — in the same way "as in the mysteries." First they dug a round pit where the Comitium, or Court of Assembly, now stands, and into this pit they threw symbolic offerings of the fruits of the earth. T h e n each man took a small piece of earth of the land from which he came, and these were all thrown into the pit together. T h e pit was given the name of mundus (which also m e a n t the cosmos). A r o u n d it R o m u l u s d r e w the b o u n d a r y of the city in a circle with a plow drawn by a bull and a cow. Wherever a gate was planned, the plowshare was taken out and the plow carried over.
The city founded in this solemn ceremony was circular in shape. Yet the old and famous
description of R o m e is urbs quadrata, the square city. According to one theory that attempts to reconcile this contradiction, the word quadrata must be u n d e r s t o o d to m e a n " q u a d r i p a r t i t e " ; that is, the circular city was divided into four parts by two main arteries running from north to south and west to east. The point of intersection coincided with the mundus m e n t i o n e d by P l u t a r c h . According to another theory, the contradiction can be understood only as a symbol, namely as a visual representation of the mathematically insoluble problem of the squaring of the circle, which had greatly preoccupied the Greeks and was to play so great a part in alchemy. Strangely enough, before describing the circle ceremony of the f o u n d a t i o n of the city by R o m u l u s , P l u t a r c h also speaks of R o m e as Roma quadrata, a s q u a r e city. For h i m , R o m e was both a circle and a square. In e a c h t h e o r y a true m a n d a l a is involved, and that links up with Plutarch's statement that the foundation of the city was taught by the Etruscans "as in the mysteries," as a secret rite. It was more than a mere outward form. By its mandala ground plan, the city, with its inhabit a n t s , is exalted a b o v e the p u r e l y secular r e a l m . This is further e m p h a s i z e d by the fact t h a t the city has a c e n t e r , the mundus, w h i c h established the city's relationship to the "other" realm, the a b o d e of the a n c e s t r a l spirits. ( T h e mundus was covered by a great stone, called the "soul stone." On certain days the stone was removed, and then, it was said, the spirits of the d e a d rose from the shaft.)
A n u m b e r of m e d i e v a l cities w e r e founded on the ground plan of a mandala and were
-' I



surrounded by an approximately circular wall. In such a city, as in Rome, two main arteries divided it into " q u a r t e r s " a n d led to the four gates. The church or cathedral stood at the point of intersection of these arteries. T h e inspiration of the medieval city with its quarters was the Heavenly Jerusalem (in the Book of Revelation), which had a square ground plan and walls with three times four gates. But Jerusalem had no temple at its center, for God's immediate presence was the center of it. (The m a n d a l a g r o u n d plan for a city is by no m e a n s o u t m o d e d . A m o d e r n e x a m p l e is the city of Washington, D.C.) Whether in classical or in primitive foundations, the mandala ground plan was never dictated by considerations of aesthetics or economics. It was a transformation of the city into an ordered cosmos, a sacred place bound by its center to the other world. And this transformation accorded with the vital feelings and needs of religious man.
Every building, sacred or secular, that has a m a n d a l a g r o u n d plan is the projection of an archetypal image from within the human unconscious onto the outer world. The city, the fortress, and the temple become symbols of psychic wholeness, and in this way exercise a specific influence on the human being who enters or lives in the place. (It need hardly be emphasized that even in architecture the projection of the psychic content was a purely unconscious process. "Such things cannot be thought up," Dr. Jung has written, "but must grow again from the forgotten depths if they are to express the deepest insights of consciousness and the loftiest intuitions of thespirit, thusamalgamating the uniqueness of present-day consciousness with the age-old past of h u m a n i t y . " )
T h e c e n t r a l s y m b o l of C h r i s t i a n art is not the mandala, but the cross or crucifix. U p to Carolingian times, the equilateral or Greek cross was the usual form, and therefore the mandala was indirectly implied. But in the course of time the
Medieval religious architecture was usually based on the shape of the cross. Left, a 13th-century church (in Ethiopia) cut from the rock.

center moved upward until the cross took on the Latin form, with the stake and the crossb e a m , t h a t is c u s t o m a r y t o d a y . T h i s d e v e l o p m e n t is i m p o r t a n t because it c o r r e s p o n d s to the inward development of Christianity up to the high Middle Ages. In simple terms, it symbolized the tendency to remove the center of man a n d his faith from the e a r t h a n d to " e l e v a t e " it into the spiritual sphere. This tendency sprang from the desire to put into action Christ's saying : " M y k i n g d o m is not of this w o r l d . " E a r t h l y life, the world, and the body were therefore forces that had to be overcome. Medieval man's hopes were thus directed to the beyond, for it was only from paradise that the promise of fulfillment beckoned.
This endeavor reached its climax in the Middle Ages and in medieval mysticism. T h e hopes of the beyond found expression not only in the raising of the center of the cross; it can also be seen in the i n c r e a s i n g h e i g h t of the Gothic cathedrals, which seem to set the laws of gravity at defiance. Their cruciform ground p l a n is t h a t of the e l o n g a t e d L a t i n cross ( t h o u g h
the baptisteries, with the font in the center, have a true mandala ground plan). With the dawning of the Renaissance, a revolutionary change began to occur in man's conception of the world. T h e " u p w a r d " movement (which reached its climax in the late Middle Ages) went into reverse; man turned back to the earth. He rediscovered the beauties of n a t u r e a n d the body, m a d e the first c i r c u m n a v i gation of the globe, and proved the world to be a sphere. T h e laws of mechanics and causality b e c a m e the f o u n d a t i o n s of science. T h e world of religious feeling, of the irrational, and of mysticism, which had played so great a part in medieval times, was more and more submerged by the triumphs of logical thought.
Similarly, art became more realistic and sensuous. It broke away from the religious subjects of the Middle Ages and embraced the whole visible world. It was overwhelmed by the manifbldness of the earth, by its splendor and horror, and became what Gothic art had been before it: a true symbol of the spirit of the age. T h u s it can hardly be regarded as accidental that



a change also came over ecclesiastical building. In contrast to the soaring Gothic cathedrals, there were more circular ground plans. The circle replaced the Latin cross. This c h a n g e in form, h o w e v e r — a n d this is the important point for the history of symbolism- must be attributed to aesthetic, and not to religious, causes. T h a t is the only possible explanation for the fact that the center of these r o u n d c h u r c h e s (the truly " h o l y " place) is empty, and that the altar stands in a recess in a wall away from the center. For that reason the plan cannot be described as a true mand a l a . An i m p o r t a n t exception is St. Peter's in Rome, which was built to ihe plans of Bramante and Michelangelo. Here the altar stands in the center. O n e is t e m p t e d , h o w e v e r , to a t t r i b u t e this e x c e p t i o n to t h e genius of the architects, for g r e a t genius is a l w a y s b o t h of a n d beyond its time.
In spite of the far-reaching changes in art, philosophy, and science brought about by the Renaissance, the central symbol of Christianity remained unchanged. Christ was still repre
sented on the L a t i n cross, as he is t o d a y . T h a t meant that the center of religious man remained anchored on a higher, more spiritual plane than that of earthly man, who had turned back to nature. T h u s a rift arose between man's traditional Christianity and his rational or intellectual mind. Since that time, these two sides of modern man have never been brought together. In the course of the centuries, with man's growing insight into nature and its laws, this division has gradually grown wider; and it still splits the psyche of the western Christian in the 20th century.
Of course, the brief historical summary given here has been over-simplified. Moreover, it omits the secret religious movements within Christianity that took account, in their beliefs, of what was usually ignored by most Christians: the question of evil, the chthonic (or earthly) spirit. Such movements were always in a minority and seldom had any very visible influence, but in their way they fulfilled the important role of a contrapuntal accompaniment to Christian spirituality.
The Renaissance interest in outer reality produced the Copernican suncentered universe (left) and turned artists away from "imaginative" art to nature: Below left, Leonardo's study of the human heart.
Renaissance art — w i t h its sensuous concern with light, nature, and the body (far left, a Tintoretto, 16th century) — set a pattern that lasted until the Impressionists. Below, a painting by Renoir (1841 -1919).



Far left, the symbolic alchemical concept of the squared c i r c l e symbol of wholeness and of the union of opposites (notethe male and female figures)-Left, a modern squared circle by the British artist Ben Nicholson (born 1 8 9 4 ) : It is a strictly g e o m e t r i c a l , empty form possessing aesthetic harmony and beauty but without symbolic meaning.
Right, a "sun w h e e l ' in a painting by the modern Japanese artist Sofu Teshigahara (born 1900) follows the tendency of many modern painters, when using "circular" shapes, to make them asymmetrical.
Among the many sects and movements that arose about A.D. 1000, the alchemists played a very important part. They exalted the mysteries of matter and set them alongside those of the "heavenly" spirit of Christianity. W h a t they sought was a wholeness of man encompassing mind and body, and they invented a thousand names and symbols for it. O n e of their central symbols was the quadratura circuli (the s q u a r ing of the circle), w h i c h is no m o r e t h a n the true mandala.
The alchemists not only recorded their work in their writings; they created a wealth of pictures of their dreams and visions —symbolic pictures that are still as profound as they are baffling. T h e y were inspired by the dark side of nature — evil, the dream, the spirit of earth. The mode of expression was always fabulous, dreamlike, and unreal, in both word and picture. The great 15th-century Flemish painter Hieronymus Bosch may be regarded as the most important representative of this kind of imaginative art.
But at the same time, more typical Renaissance painters (working in the full light of day, so to speak) were producing the most splendid works of sensuous art. T h e i r fascination with earth and nature went so deep that it practically determined the development of visual art for the next five c e n t u r i e s . T h e last g r e a t r e p r e sentatives of sensuous art, the art of the passing moment, of light and air, were the 19th-century impressionists.
W'e may here discriminate between two radically different modes of artistic representation. Many attempts have been made to define their characteristics. Recently Herbert Kiihn (whose work on the cave-paintings I have already mentioned) has tried to draw a distinction between what he calls the "imaginative" and the "sensory" style. The "sensory" style generally depicts a direct reproduction of nature or of the picture-subject. The "imaginative," on the other hand, presents a fantasy or experience of the artist in an "unrealistic," even dreamlike, and sometimes "abstract" manner. Kiihn's two conceptions seem so simple and so clear that I am glad to make use of them.
T h e first b e g i n n i n g s of i m a g i n a t i v e art go back very far in history. In the Mediterranean basin, its efflorescence dates from the third millennium B.C. It has only recently been realized that these ancient works of art are not the results of incompetence or ignorance; they are modes of expression of a perfectly definite religious and spiritual emotion. And they have a special appeal today, for, d u r i n g the last halfcentury, art has been passing once more through a phase that can be described by the term "imaginative." Today the geometrical, or "abstract," symbol of the circle has again come to play a considerable role in painting. But with few exceptions the traditional mode of representation has undergone a characteristic transformation that corresponds to the dilemma of modern man's ex

istence. The circle is no longer a single m e a n ingful figure that embraces a whole world and dominates the picture. Sometimes the artist has taken it out of its dominant position, replacing it by a loosely organized g r o u p of circles. Sometimes the p l a n e of the circle is a s y m m e t r i c a l . An example of the asymmetrical circular plane may be seen in the famous sun disks of the French painter Robert Delaunay. A painting by the modern English painter Ceri Richards, now in Dr. J u n g ' s collection, contains an entirely asymmetrical circular plane, while far to the left there a p p e a r s a very m u c h smaller and empty circle. I n the F r e n c h p a i n t e r H e n r i Matisse's Slill Life with Vase of Nasturtiums, the focus of vision is a green s p h e r e on a s l a n t i n g black beam, which seems to gather into itself the manifold circles of the nasturtium leaves. T h e sphere overlaps a rectangular figure, the top left-hand c o r n e r of which is folded over. Given the artistic perfection of the p a i n t i n g it is easy to forget that in the past these two abstract figures (the circle a n d the s q u a r e ) would h a v e been united, and would have expressed a world of thoughts and feelings. But anyone who does remember, and raises the question of meaning, will find food for t h o u g h t : T h e two figures that from the beginning of time have formed a whole are in this painting torn apart or incoherently related. Yet both are there and are touching each other.

Dr. J u n g has pointed out thai a true symbol appears only when there is a need to express w h a t t h o u g h t c a n n o t think or what is only divined or felt; that is the p u r pose of Rice's simple figure at the "limits of understanding." It is i m p o r t a n t to note t h a t the s q u a r e , or groups of rectangles and squares, or rectangles and rhomboids, have a p p e a r e d in modern art just as often as the circle. The master of harmonious (indeed, "musical" ) compositions with squares is the D u t c h - b o r n artist Piet M o n d r i a n . As a rule there is no actual center in any of his pictures, yet they form an ordered whole in their own strict, almost ascetic fashion. Still more common are paintings by other artists with irregular quaternary compositions, or numerous rectangles combined in more or less loose groups.
T h e circle is a symbol of the psyche even Plato described the psyche as a sphere). T h e s q u a r e ' a n d often the r e c t a n g l e is a symbol ofearthbound matter, of the body and reality. In most modern art, the connection between these two p r i m a r y forms is either nonexistent, or loose a n d casual. Their s e p a r a t i o n is another symbolic expression of the psychic state of 20th-century m a n : His soul has lost its roots a n d he is t h r e a t e n e d bv dissocia
tion. Even in the world situation of today fas Dr. J u n g pointed out in his o p e n i n g c h a p ter), this split has become evident: The western and eastern halves of the earth are separated by an Iron Curtain. But the frequency with which the square and the circle appear must not be overlooked. There seems to be an uninterrupted psychic urge to bring into consciousness the basic factors of life that they symbolize. Also, in certain abstract pictures of our time (which merely represent a colored s t r u c t u r e or a kind of " p r i m a l m a t t e r " ), these forms occasionally a p p e a r as if they were germs of new growth. The symbol of the circle has played a curious p a r t in a very different p h e n o m e n o n of the life of o u r d a y , a n d occasionally still does so. In the last years of the Second World War, there arose the "visionary r u m o r " of round flying bodies that became known as "flying saucers" or IT'Os unidentified flying objects). J u n g has explained the U F O s as a projection of a psychic content (of wholeness that has at all times been symbolized by the circle. In other winds, this "visionary rumor," as can also be seen in m a n y d r e a m s of o u r t i m e , is an a t t e m p t by the unconscious collective psyche to heal the split in our apocalyptic age by means of the symbol of the circle.

Above, an illustration from a 1 6th century German broadsheet of some strange circular objects seen in the sky - similar to the "flying saucers" that have been seen in recent years. Jung has suggested that such visions are projections of the archetype of wholeness.



Modern painting as a symbol
The terms "modern art" and "modern painting" are used in this chapter as the layman uses them. What I will be dealing with, to use Kiihn"s t e r m , is m o d e r n imaginative p a i n t i n g . Pictures of this kind can be " a b s t r a c t " (or rather "non-figurative") but they need not always be so. There will be no attempt to distinguish a m o n g such various forms as fauvism, cubism, expressionism, futurism, suprematism, constructivism, orphism, and so on. Any specific allusion to one or the other of these groups will be quite exceptional.
And I am not concerned with an aesthetic differentiation of modern paintings; nor, above all, with artistic evaluations. Modern imaginative p a i n t i n g is here t a k e n simply as a p h e n o m e n o n of o u r t i m e . T h a t is the only w a y in w h i c h the question of its symbolic content can be justified a n d a n s w e r e d . I n this brief c h a p t e r it is possible to mention only a few artists, and to select a few of their works more or less at random. I must content myself with discussing modern painting in terms of a small n u m b e r of its representatives.
M y s t a r t i n g point is the psychological fact that the artist has at all times been the instrument and spokesman of the spirit of his age. His work can be only partly understood in terms of his personal psychology. Consciously or unconsciously, the artist gives form to the nature and values of his time, which in their turn form him. The modern artist himself often recognizes the interrelation of the work of art and its time. Thus the French critic and painter Jean Bazaine writes in his Notes on Contemporary Painting: " N o b o d y p a i n t s as he likes. All a p a i n t e r can d o is to will with all his m i g h t the p a i n t i n g his age is c a p a b l e of." T h e G e r m a n artist Franz Marc, who died in the First World War, said: " T h e great artists do not seek their forms in the mist of the past, but take the deepest soundings they can of the genuine, pro
foundest center of gravity of their age." And, as far back as 1911, Kandinsky wrote in his famous essay "Concerning the Spiritual in A r t " : " E v e r y epoch is given its o w n m e a s u r e of artistic freedom, and even the most creative genius may not leap over the boundary of that freedom." For the last 50 years, "modern art" has been a general bone of contention, and the discussion has lost none of its heat. T h e " y e a s " are as passionate as the " n a y s " ; yet the reiterated p r o p h e c y t h a t " m o d e r n " a r t is finished has never come true. T h e new way of expression has been triumphant to an unimagined degree. If it is t h r e a t e n e d at all, it will be because it has degenerated into mannerism and modishness. (In the Soviet Union, where non-figurative art has often been officially discouraged a n d p r o d u c e d only in p r i v a t e , figurative art is threatened by a similar degeneration.)
T h e general public, in Europe at any rate, is still in the h e a t of the b a t t l e . T h e violence of the discussion shows that feeling runs high in both camps. Even those who are hostile to modern art cannot avoid being impressed by the works they reject; they are irritated or repelled, but (as the violence of their feelings shows) they are moved. As a rule, the negative fascination is n o less s t r o n g t h a n the positive. T h e stream of visitors to exhibitions of modern art, wherever and whenever they take place, testifies to something more than curiosity. Curiosity would be satisfied sooner. And the fantastic prices that are paid for works of modern art are a measure of the status conferred upon them by society.
Fascination arises when the unconscious has been moved. T h e effect produced by works of modern art cannot be explained entirely by their visible form. To the eye trained in "classic" or "sensory" art," they are new and alien. Nothing in works of non-figurative art reminds the spectator of his own world no objects in
250



their own everyday surroundings, no human being or animal that speaks a familiar lang u a g e . T h e r e is no w e l c o m e , no visible a c c o r d in the cosmos created by the artist. And yet, w i t h o u t a n y q u e s t i o n , t h e r e is a h u m a n b o n d . It may be even more intense than in works of sensory art, which make a direct appeal to feeling and empathy. It is the a i m of t h e m o d e r n artist to give expression to his inner vision of man, to the spiritual b a c k g r o u n d of life a n d the world. T h e modern work of art has a b a n d o n e d not only the realm of the concrete, " n a t u r a l , " sensuous world, but also that of the individual. It has become highly collective and therefore (even in the abbreviation of the pictorial hieroglyph) touches not only the few but the many. What r e m a i n s i n d i v i d u a l is the m a n n e r of r e p r e s e n tation, the style and quality of the modern work of a r t . It is often difficult for the l a y m a n to recognize whether the artist's intentions are genuine and his expressions spontaneous, neither imitated nor aimed at effect. In many cases he must accustom himself to new kinds of line and color. He must learn them, as he would learn a foreign language, before he can judge their expressiveness and quality.
T h e pioneers of modern art have apparently understood how much they were asking of the public. Never have artists published so many "manifestoes'" and explanations of their aims as in the 20th century. It is, however, not only to others that they are striving to explain and
justify w h a t they a r e d o i n g ; it is also to t h e m selves. For the most part, these manifestoes are artistic confessions of faith —poetic and often confused or self-contradictory attempts to give clarity to the strange outcome of today's artistic activities. W h a t really matters, of course, is (and always has been) the direct encounter with the work of art. Yet, for the psychologist w h o is concerned with the symbolic content of modern a r t , the s t u d y of these writings is most instructive. For that reason the artists, wherever possible, will be allowed in the following discussion to speak for themselves. T h e beginnings of modern art appeared in the early 1900s. O n e of the most impressive personalities of that initiatory phase was Kandinsky, whose influence is still clearly t r a c e a b l e in the paintings of the second half of the century. M a n y of his ideas have proved prophetic. In his essay "Concerning F o r m , " he writes: " T h e art of today embodies the spiritual matured to the point of revelation. T h e forms of this embodiment may be arranged between two poles: (1) great abstraction; (2) great realism. These two poles open two paths, which both lead to one goal in the e n d . T h e s e t w o e l e m e n t s h a v e a l w a y s been p r e s e n t in a r t ; the first was expressed in the second. T o d a y it looks as if they were about to carry on separate existences. Art seems to have put an end to the pleasant completion of the abstract by the concrete, and vice versa."

Left and above, two compositions by Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948). His kind of imaginative art uses ( a n d t r a n s f o r m s ) o r d i n a r y thingsin this case, old tickets, paper, metal, etc. Below left, pieces of w o o d similarly used by Hans Arp ( 1 8 8 7 - 1 9 6 6 ) . Below, in a sculpture by Picasso (1881 -1973), ordinary objects — l e a v e s — a r e part of the subject rather than the material.



To illustrate Kandinsky's point that the two elements of art, the abstract and the concrete, have parted company: In 1913, the Russian painter Kasimir Malevich painted a picture that consisted only of a black square on a white ground. It was perhaps the first purely " a b stract" picture ever painted. H e wrote of it: "In my desperate struggle to liberate art from the ballast of the world of objects, I took refuge in the form of the square." A year later, the French painter Marcel D u c h a m p set up an object chosen at random (a bottle rack) on a pedestal and exhibited it. J e a n Bazaine wrote of it: "This bottle rack, torn from its utilitarian context and washed up on the beach, has been invested with the lonely dignity of the derelict. Good for nothing, there to be used, ready for a n y t h i n g , it is alive. It lives o n the fringe of existence its own disturbing, absurd life. T h e disturbing object t h a t is the first step to a r t . " In its weird dignity and a b a n d o n m e n t , the object was immeasurably exalted and given significance that can only be called magical. Hence its "disturbing, absurd life." It became an idol and at the same time an object of mockery. Its intrinsic reality was annihilated. Both Malcvich's square and Duchamp's bottle rack were symbolic gestures that had nothing to do with art in the strict sense of the word. Yet they mark the two extremes ("great abstraction" and "great realism") between which the imaginative art of the succeeding decades may be aligned and understood. From the psychological standpoint, the two gestures toward the naked object (matter) and the naked non-object (spirit) point to a collective psychic rift that created its symbolic expression in the years before the catastrophe of the First W o r l d W a r . T h i s rift h a d first a p p e a r e d in the Renaissance, when it became manifest as a conflict between knowledge and faith. Meanwhile, civilization was removing man further and further from his instinctual foundation, so that a gulf opened between nature and mind, between the unconscious and consciousness. These opposites characterize the psychic situation t h a t is seeking expression in m o d e r n a r t .
The secret soul of things
As we have seen, the starting point of "the concrete" was Duchamp's famous — or notorious— bottle rack. The bottle rack was not intended to be artistic in itself. D u c h a m p called himself an "anti-artist." But it brought to light an element that was to mean a great deal to artists for a long time to come. T h e n a m e they gave to it was objel Iroiwe or " r e a d y - m a d e . " T h e Spanish painter J o a n Miro, for instance, goes to the beach every dawn "to collect things washed up by the tide. Things lying there, waiting for someone to discover their persona l i t y . " H e keeps his finds in his studio. N o w and then he assembles some of them and the most curious compositions result: "The artist is often surprised himself at the shapes of his own creation." As far back as 1912, the Spanish-born artist Pablo Picasso and the French artist Georges Braque made what they called "collages" from scraps of rubbish. M a x Ernst cut clippings from the illustrated papers of the so-called age of big business, assembled them as the fancy took him, and so transformed the stuffy solidity of the bourgeois age into a demonic, dreamlike unreality. The German painter Kurt Schwitters worked with the contents of his ash can: He used nails, brown paper, ragged scraps of newspaper, railway tickets, and remnants of cloth. He succeeded in assembling this rubbish with such seriousness and freshness that surprising effects of strange beauty came about. In Schwitters' obsession with things, however, this m a n n e r of composition occasionally became merely absurd. He made a construction of rubbish that he called " a cathedral built for t h i n g s . " S c h w i t t e r s w o r k e d on it for 10 years, and three stories of his own house had to be demolished to give him the space he needed.
Schwitters' work, and the magical exaltation of the object, give the first h i n t of the p l a c e of modern art in the history of the h u m a n mind, and of its symbolic significance. T h e y reveal
253



the tradition that was being unconsciously perp e t u a t e d . It is the t r a d i t i o n of the h e r m e t i c Christian brotherhoods of the Middle Ages, and of the alchemists, who conferred even on matter, the stuff of the earth, the dignity of their religious contemplation. Schwitters' exaltation of the grossest material to the rank of art, to a "cathedral" (in which the rubbish would leave no room for a h u m a n being), faithfully followed the old alchemical tenet according to which the sought-for precious object is to be found in filth. K a n d i n s k y expressed the same ideas when he wrote: " E v e r y t h i n g t h a t is dead quivers. N o t only the things of poetry, stars, moon, wood, flowers, but even a white trouser button glittering out of a p u d d l e in the street . . . . Everything has a secret soul, w h i c h is silent m o r e often t h a n it speaks."
What the artists, like the alchemists, probably did not realize was the psychological fact that they were projecting part of their psyche into matter or inanimate objects. Hence the "mysterious animation" that entered into such things, and the great value attached even to rubbish. They projected their own darkness, their earthly shadow, a psychic content that they and their time had lost and abandoned.
Unlike the alchemists, however, men like Schwitters were not contained in and protected by the Christian order. In one sense, Schwitters' work is o p p o s e d to it: A kind of m o n o mania binds him to matter, while Christianity seeks to vanquish matter. And yet, paradoxically, it is S c h w i t t e r s ' m o n o m a n i a t h a t robs the material in his creations of its inherent significance as concrete reality. In his pictures, matter is t r a n s f o r m e d into a n " a b s t r a c t " c o m p o s i t i o n . Therefore it begins to discard its substantiality, and to dissolve. In that very process, these pictures become a symbolic expression of our time, which has seen the concept of the "absolute" concreteness of matter undermined by modern atomic physics.
Painters began to think about the "magic object" and the "secret soul" of things. T h e Italian p a i n t e r C a r l o C a r r a w r o t e : " I t is common things that reveal those forms of
simplicity through which wc can realize that higher, more significant condition of being where the whole splendor of art resides." Paul Klee said: "The object expands beyond the bounds of its appearance by our knowledge t h a t the t h i n g is m o r e t h a n its exterior presents to our eyes." And Jean Bazaine wrote: "An object awakens our love just because it seems to be the bearer of powers that are greater than itself."
Sayings of this kind recall the old alchemical concept of a "spirit in matter," believed to be the spirit in and behind inanimate objects like metal or stone. Psychologically interpreted, this spirit is the unconscious. It always manifests itself when conscious or rational knowledge has reached its limits and mystery sets in, for man t e n d s to fill the i n e x p l i c a b l e a n d mysterious with the contents of his unconscious. He projects t h e m , as it were, into a d a r k , e m p t y vessel. The feeling that the object was "more than met the eye," which was shared by many artists, found a most remarkable expression in the work of the Italian painter Giorgio de Chirico. He was a mystic by temperament, and a tragic seeker who never found what he sought. On his self-portrait (1908) he wrote: El quid, amabo nisi quod aenigma esl ( " A n d w h a t a m I to love if not the e n i g m a ? " ) . Chirico was the founder of the so-called pillura melajisica. " E v e r y o b j e c t , " he wrote, "has two aspects: The common aspect, which is the o n e we generally sec a n d w h i c h is seen by everyone, and the ghostly and metaphysical aspect, which only rare individuals see at moments of clairvoyance and metaphysical meditation. A work of art must relate something that does not appear in its visible form." Chirico's works reveal this "ghostly aspect" of things. T h e y are dreamlike transpositions of reality, which arise as visions from the unconscious. But his " m e t a p h y s i c a l a b s t r a c t i o n " is expressed in a panic-stricken rigidity, and the a t m o s p h e r e of the pictures is one of n i g h t m a r e and of fathomless melancholy. T h e city squares of Italy, the towers and objects, are set in an over-acute perspective, as if they were in a vacuum, illuminated by a merciless, cold light
254



A n example of "surrealist" art:
Les Souliers Rouges, b y t h e F r e n c h painter Rene Magntte (1898-1967) M u c h of the disturbing effect of surrealist painting comes from its association and juxtaposition of unrelated objects often absurd, irrational, and dreamlike
from an unseen source. Antique heads or statues of gods conjure up the classical past. In one of the most terrifying of his pictures, he has placed beside the marble head oi a goddess a pair of red rubber gloves, a "magic object'" in the modern sense. A green ball on the ground acts as a symbol, uniting the crass opposites; without it, there would be more than a hint of psychic disintegration. This picture was clearly not the result of over-sophisticated deliberation ; it must be taken as a d r e a m p i c t u r e . Chirico was deeply influenced by the philosophies of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. He wrote: "Schopenhauer and Nietzsche were the first to teach the d e e p significance of the senselessness of life, and to show how this senselessness could be transformed into art . . . . T h e dreadful void they discovered is the very soulless and u n t r o u b l e d b e a u t y of m a t t e r . " It may be doubted whether Chirico succeeded in transposing the "dreadful void" into "untroubled beauty." Some of his pictures are extremely disturbing; many are as terrifying as nightmares. But in his effort to find artistic expres
sion for the void, he p e n e t r a t e d to the core of the existential dilemma of contemporary man. Nietzsche, whom Chirico quotes as his authority, has given a name to the "dreadful void" in his saying " G o d is d e a d . " W i t h o u t referring to Nietzsche, K a n d i n s k y w r o t e in On the Spiritual in Art: " H e a v e n is e m p t y . G o d is d e a d . " A phrase of this kind may sound abominable. But it is not new. T h e idea of the " d e a t h of G o d " and its immediate consequence, the " m e t a physical void." had troubled the minds of 19thcentury poets, especially in France and Germany. It was a long development that, in the 20th century, reached the stage of open discussion and found expression in art. The cleavage between modern art and Christianity was finally accomplished.
Dr. J u n g also came to realize that this strange and mysterious phenomenon of the d e a t h of G o d is a psychic fact of o u r time. In 1937 he wrote: "I know and here I am expressing what countless other people know that the present time is the t i m e of G o d ' s disappearance and death." For years he had observed the Christian God-image fading in his patients" dreams that is, in the unconscious of m o d e r n m e n . T h e loss of t h a t i m a g e is the loss of the s u p r e m e factor that gives life a m e a n i n g .
It must be pointed out, however, that neither Nietzsche's assertion that G o d is d e a d , nor Chirico's ""metaphysical void," nor Jung's deductions from unconscious images, have anything final to say about the reality and existence of God or of a transcendental being or not-being. They are human assertions. In each case they are based, as J u n g h a s shown in Psychology and Religion, on c o n t e n t s of the unconscious psyche that have entered consciousness in tangible form as images, dreams, ideas, or intuitions. T h e origin of these contents, and the cause of such a transformation (from a living to a dead God), must remain unknown, on the frontier of mystery. C h i r i c o never c a m e to a solution ol the problem presented to him by the unconscious. His failure may be seen most clearly in his representation of the h u m a n figure. Given the present
religious situation, it is man himself to whom



Both Giorgio de Chirico (born 1888) and Marc Chagall (born 1887) have sought to look behind the outward appearances of things; their work seems to have risen from the depths of the unconscious. But Chirico's v i s i o n ( b e l o w , his Philosopher and Poet) w a s g l o o m y , m e l a n c h o l y , e v e n nightmarish. Chagall's has always been rich, warm, and alive. Right, one of his great stained-glass w i n d o w s created in 1962 for a Jerusalem synagogue

should be a c c o r d e d a new, if i m p e r s o n a l , dignity and responsibility. (Jung described it as a responsibility to consciousness.) But in Chirico's work, m a n is d e p r i v e d of his soul; he b e c o m e s a mamchino, a p u p p e t w i t h o u t a face ( a n d therefore also without consciousness). In the v a r i o u s versions of his Great Metaphysician, a faceless figure is e n t h r o n e d on a pedestal m a d e of r u b b i s h . T h e figure is a consciously or unconsciously ironical representation of the m a n who strives to discover the " t r u t h " about metaphysics, and at the same time a symbol of ultimate loneliness and senselessness. O r p e r h a p s the manichini (which also h a u n t the works of other contemporary artists) are a premonition of the faceless mass man. When he was 40, Chirico, abandoned his/;//lura metafisica; he t u r n e d back to t r a d i t i o n a l m o d e s , b u t his w o r k lost d e p t h . H e r e is c e r t a i n proof that there is no " b a c k to w h e r e you c a m e from" for the creative mind whose unconscious has been involved in the fundamental dilemma of modern existence. A counterpart to Chirico might be seen in the Russian-born painter Marc Chagall. His quest in his work is also a " m y s t e r i o u s a n d lonely poetry" and "the ghostly aspect of things that only rare individuals may see." But Chagall's rich symbolism is rooted in the piety of Eastern Jewish Hassidism and in a warm feeling for life. H e was faced with neither the problem of the void nor the death of God. He wrote : "Everything may change in our demoralized world except the heart, man's love, and his striving to know the divine. Painting, like all poetry, has its part in the divine; people feel this today just as m u c h as they used t o . "
The British author Sir Herbert Read once wrote of Chagall that he never quite crossed the threshold into the unconscious, but "has always kept one foot on the earth that had n o u r i s h e d h i m . " T h i s is exactly t h e " r i g h t " relation to the unconscious. It is all the m o r e important that, as Read emphasizes, "Chagall has remained one of the most influential artists of our time."
With the contrast between Chagall and Chirico, a q u e s t i o n arises t h a t is i m p o r t a n t for the
u n d e r s t a n d i n g of symbolism in m o d e r n a r t : How does the relationship between consciousness and the unconscious take shape in the work of modern artists? Or, to put it another way, where does man stand? One answer may be found in the movement called surrealism, of which the French poet A n d r e Breton is r e g a r d e d as the founder. (Chirico too may be described as a surrealist.) As a student of medicine, Breton had been introduced to the work of Freud. Thus dreams came to play an important part in his ideas. " C a n dreams not be used to solve the fundamental problems of life?" he wrote. "I believe that the apparent antagonism between dream and reality will be resolved in a kind of absolute reality — in surreality."
Breton grasped the point admirably. What he sought was a reconciliation of the opposites, consciousness and the unconscious. But the way he took to reach his goal could only lead him astray. He began to experiment with Freud's method of free association as well as with automatic writing, in which the words and phrases arising from the unconscious are set down without any conscious control. Breton called it: "thought's dictation, independent of anv aesthetic or moral preoccupation."
But that process simply means that the way is o p e n e d to the s t r e a m of unconscious images, and the important or even decisive part to be p l a y e d by consciousness is i g n o r e d . As Dr. J u n g has s h o w n in his c h a p t e r , it is consciousness that holds the key to the values of the unconscious, and that therefore plays the decisive p a r t . Consciousness alone is c o m p e t e n t to determine the meaning of the images and to recognize their significance for m a n here and now, in the concrete reality of the present. Only in a n interplay of consciousness a n d the u n c o n scious can the unconscious prove its value, and perhaps even show a way to overcome the melancholy of the void. If the unconscious, once in a c t i o n , is left to itself, there is a risk t h a t its contents will become overpowering or will manifest their negative, destructive side.
If we look at surrealist pictures (like Salvador Dali's The Burning Giraffe) with this in m i n d .
257



we may feel the wealth of their fantasy and the overwhelming power of their unconscious imagery, but we realize the horror and the symbolism of the end of all things that speaks from m a n y of t h e m . T h e unconscious is p u r e n a t u r e , and, like nature, pours out its gifts in profusion. But left to itself a n d without the h u m a n response from consciousness, it can (again like nature) destroy its own gifts and sooner or later sweep them into annihilation.
T h e question of the role of consciousness in modern painting also arises in connection with t h e use of chance as a m e a n s of c o m p o s i n g p a i n t i n g s . I n Beyond Painting M a x Ernst wrote: " T h e association of a sewing machine a n d an u m b r e l l a on a surgical table [he is q u o t i n g from the poet L a u t r e a m o n t ] is a familiar example, which has now become classical, of the phenomenon discovered by the surrealists, that the association of two (or more) apparently alien elements on a plane alien to b o t h is the most p o t e n t ignition of p o e t r y .

(We might recall here the "chance" association of a m a r b l e head and red r u b b e r gloves in Chirico's picture.) Of course, many of these associations were intended as jokes and nonsense. But most modern artists have been concerned with something radically different from jokes. Chance plays a significant part in the work of the French sculptor Jean (or Hans) Arp. His woodcuts of leaves and other forms, thrown together at random, were another expression of the quest for, as he put it, "a secret, primal meaning slumbering beneath the world of app e a r a n c e s . " H e called t h e m Leaves arranged according to the laws of chance a n d Squares arranged according to the laws of chance. I n these c o m positions it is c h a n c e t h a t gives d e p t h to the work of art; it points to an unknown but active principle of order and meaning that becomes manifest in things as their " s e c r e t s o u l . "
It was above all the desire to " m a k e chance essential" (in Paul Klee's words) that underlay the surrealists' efforts to take the grain of wood, cloud formations, and so on as a starting point for their visionary p a i n t i n g . M a x Ernst, for instance, went back to Leonardo da Vinci, who wrote an essay on Botticelli's r e m a r k that if
you throw a paint-soaked sponge at a wall, in the splashes it makes you will see heads, animals, landscapes, and a host of other configurations. Ernst has described how a vision pursued him in 1925. It forced itself on him as he was staring at a tiled floor marked by thousands of scratches. " I n order to give foundation to my powers of meditation and hallucination, I made a series of drawings of the tiles by laying sheets of paper on them at random and then taking g r a p h i t e r u b b i n g s . W h e n I fixed m y eyes on the result, I was astounded by a suddenly sharpened sense of a hallucinatory series of contrasting and superposed pictures. I made a collection of the first results o b t a i n e d from these 'frottages' a n d called it Hisloire Nalurelle."
It is i m p o r t a n t to note t h a t Ernst placed over or b e h i n d some of these frottages a r i n g or circle, which gives the picture a peculiar atmosphere and depth. Here the psychologist can recognize the unconscious drive to oppose the chaotic hazards of the image's natural language by the symbol of a self-contained psychic whole, thus establishing equilibrium. The ring or circle dominates the picture. Psychic wholeness rules nature, itself meaningful and giving meaning.
Right. Roman coins used in places progressively farther away from Rome. On the last coin (farthest from the controlling center) the face has disintegrated. This strangely corresponds to the psychic disintegration that such drugs as LSD 25 can induce. Below, drawings done by an artist w h o took this drug in a test held in Germany in 1951. The drawings grow more abstract as conscious control is o v e r c o m e by the u n c o n s c i o u s .

Iii M a x Ernst's efforts to pursue the secret pattern in things, we may detect an affinity with the 19th-century Romantics. They spoke of nature's "handwriting,"' which can be seen everywhere, on wings, eggshells, in clouds, snow, ice crystals, and other "strange conjunctions of c h a n c e " j u s t as m u c h as in d r e a m s or visions. They saw everything as the expression of one and the same "pictorial language of n a t u r e . " T h u s it was a genuinely r o m a n t i c gesture when Max Ernst called the pictures produced by his experiments "natural history." And he was right, for the unconscious (which had conjured up the pictures in the chance c o n f i g u r a t i o n of things) is n a t u r e .
It is with E r n s t ' s Natural History or A r p ' s c o m p o s i t i o n s of c h a n c e t h a t the reflections of the psychologist begin. H e is faced with the question of w h a t m e a n i n g a c h a n c e a r r a n g e ment—wherever and whenever it comes about — can have for the m a n who happens on it. With this question, man and consciousness come into the matter, and with them the possibility of meaning. The chance-created picture may be beautiful or ugly, harmonious or discordant, rich or poor in content, well- or ill-painted. These factors determine its artistic value, but they cannot satisfy the psychologist (often to the distress of the artist or of a n y o n e w h o finds s u p r e m e satisfaction in the contemplation of form). T h e psychologist seeks further and tries to understand the "secret code" of chance arrangement -in so far as man can decipher it at all. T h e n u m ber and form of the objects thrown together at random by Arp raise as many questions as any
detail of E r n s t ' s fantastic frottages. F o r the psychologist, they are symbols; and therefore they can not only be felt but (up to a certain point) can also be interpreted. T h e apparent or actual retreat of man from many modern works of art, the lack of reflection, and the predominance of the unconscious over consciousness offer critics frequent points of attack. They speak of pathological art or comp a r e it with pictures by the i n s a n e , for it is characteristic of psychosis that consciousness and the ego-personality are submerged and " d r o w n e d " by floods of contents from the unconscious regions of the psyche. It is t r u e t h a t the c o m p a r i s o n is not so odious today as it was even a generation ago. W h e n D r . J u n g first p o i n t e d out a c o n n e c t i o n of this kind in his essay on Picasso (1932), it provoked a storm of indignation. T o d a y , the catalogue of a well-known Zurich art gallery speaks of the "almost schizophrenic obsession" of a famous artist, and the German writer Rudolf Kassner described Georg Trakl as "one of the greatest German poets," continuing: "There was something schizophrenic a b o u t him. It can be felt in his w o r k ; there is a touch of schizophrenia in it too. Yes, T r a k l is a great p o e t . "
It is now realized t h a t a state of schizophrenia and the artistic vision are not mutually exclusive. To my mind, the famous experiments with mescalin and similar drugs have contributed to this change of attitude. These drugs create a condition accompanied by intense visions of colors and forms — not unlike schizophrenia. More than one artist of today has sought inspiration in such a drug.



The retreat from reality
F r a n z M a r c o n c e said : " T h e a r t t h a t is c o m i n g will give formal expression to our scientific conviction." This was a truly prophetic saying. We have traced the influence on artists of Freud's psychoanalysis and of the discovery (or rediscovery) of the unconscious in the early years of the 20th century. Another important point is the connection between m o d e r n art a n d the results of research in nuclear physics. T o put it in simple, nonscientific terms, nuclear physics has robbed the basic units of matter of their absolute concreteness. It has made matter mysterious. Paradoxically, mass and energy, wave and particle, have proved to be interchangeable. The laws of cause and effect have become valid only up to a certain point. It does not matter at all that these relativities, discontinuities, and paradoxes hold good only on the margins of our world only for the infinitely small (the atom) a n d the infinitely g r e a t (the cosmos). T h e y h a v e caused a r e v o l u t i o n a r y c h a n g e in t h e c o n c e p t of reality, for a new. totally different, and irrational reality has dawned behind the reality of our " n a t u r a l " w o r l d , w h i c h is ruled by the laws of classical physics. Corresponding relativities and paradoxes were discovered in the domain of the psyche. Here. too. another world dawned on the margin of the world of consciousness, governed by new and hitherto unknown laws that are
strangely akin to the laws of nuclear physics. The parallelism between nuclear physics and the psychology of the collective unconscious was often a subject of discussion between J u n g and Wolfgang Pauli, the Xobel prizewinner in physics. T h e space-time continuum of physics and the collective unconscious can be seen, so to speak, as the outer and inner aspects of one and the same reality behind appearances. (The relationship between physics and psychology will be discussed by Dr. M.-L. von Franz in her concluding essay.)
It is c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of this one world b e h i n d the worlds of physics and the psyche that its laws, processes, and contents are unimaginable. T h a t is a fact of o u t s t a n d i n g i m p o r t a n c e for the understanding of the art of our time. For the main subject of modern art is, in a certain sense, unimaginable too. Therefore much modern art has become "abstract." The great artists of this century have sought to give visible form to the "life behind things" and so their works are a symbolic expression of a world behind
The paintings on these pages, all by Franz Marc (1880-1916), show his gradual development away from a concern with outward things, toward a more completely "abstract" art Far left, Blue Horses ( 1 9 1 1 ); c e n t e r , Roesina Wood ( 1 9 1 3 - 1 4 ) ; b e l o w , Play of Forms ( 1 9 1 4 ) ,



consciousness (or, indeed, behind d r e a m s , for dreams are only rarely non-figurative). Thus they point to the " o n e " reality, the " o n e " life, which seems to be the c o m m o n background of the two domains of physical and psychicappearances. O n l y a few artists realized the connection between their form of expression and physics and psychology. K a n d i n s k y is o n e of the masters w h o expressed the deep emotion he felt at the early discoveries of modern physical research. " I n my mind, the collapse of the atom was the c o l l a p s e of the whole world: Suddenly the stoutest walls fell. Everything turned unstable, insecure, and soft. I would not have been surprised if a stone h a d melted into thin air before my eyes. Science seemed to have been annihilated." What resulted from this disillusion was the artist's withdrawal from the "realm of nature," from the "populous foreground of things." " I t s e e m e d , " K a n d i n s k y a d d e d , "as if I saw art steadily disengaging itself from nature."
This separation from the world of things happened more or less at the same time to other artists, too. Franz Marc wrote: "Have we not learned from a thousand years of experience that things cease to speak the more we hold up to them the visual mirror of their a p p e a r a n c e ? A p p e a r a n c e is e t e r n a l l y flat. . . . " For Marc, the goal of art was "to reveal unearthly life dwelling b e h i n d e v e r y t h i n g , to break the mirror of life so that we m a y look being in the face." Paul Klee wrote: " T h e artist does not ascribe to the natural form of

The art of Paul Klee is a visual exploration and expression of the spirit in and behind n a t u r e — t h e unconscious or, as he termed it, the "secretly perceived." Sometimes his vision can be disturbing and d e m o n i c , as in his Death and Fire, right; or it can be a more poetic k i n d o f f a n t a s y , as in his Sinbad the Sailor (far r i g h t ) .
appearance the same convincing significance as the realists w h o are his critics. H e does not feel so intimately bound to that reality, because he cannot see in the formal products of nature the essence of the creative process. H e is m o r e concerned with formative powers than with formal products." Piet Mondrian accused cubism of not having pursued abstraction to its logical end, "the expression of pure reality." That can only be attained by the "creation of pure form," unconditioned by subjective feelings and ideas. "Behind changing natural forms there lies changeless pure reality."
A great number of artists were seeking to get past appearances into the "reality" of the background or the "spirit in matter" by a transmutation of things —through fantasy, surrealism, dream pictures, the use of chance, etc. T h e "abstract" artists, however, turned their backs on things. Their paintings contained no identifiable c o n c r e t e o b j e c t s ; they w e r e , in M o n drian's words, simply "pure form." But it must be realized that what these artists were concerned with was something far greater than a problem of form and the distinction b e t w e e n " c o n c r e t e " a n d " a b s t r a c t , " figurative aad non-figurative. Their goal was the center of life and things, their changeless background, and an inward certitude. Art had become mysticism. T h e spirit in whose mystery art was submerged was an earthly spirit, which the medieval alchemists h a d called M e r c u r i u s . H e is a symbol of the spirit that these artists divined or sought behind nature and things, "behind the

appearance of nature." Their mysticism was alien to Christianity, for that " M e r c u r i a l " spirit is alien to a " h e a v e n l y " spirit. I n d e e d , it was Christianity's dark adversary that was forging its way in art. Here we begin to see the real historical and symbolic significance of "modern art." Like the hermetic movements in the Middle Ages, it must be understood as a mysticism of the spirit of earth, and therefore as an expression of our time compensatory to Christianity.
No artist sensed this mystic background of art more clearly or spoke of it with greater passion than Kandinsky. T h e importance of the great works of art of all time did not lie, in his eyes, "on the surface, in externals, but in the root of all roots — in the mystical content of art." Therefore he says: " T h e artist's eye should always be turned in upon his inner life, and his ear should be always alert for the voice of i n w a r d necessity. T h i s is the only w a y of giving expression to what the mystic vision commands."
Kandinsky called his pictures a spiritual expression of the cosmos, a music of the spheres, a harmony of colors and forms. "Form, even if it is q u i t e a b s t r a c t a n d g e o m e t r i c a l , has a n i n w a r d c l a n g ; it is a spiritual being with effects that coincide absolutely with that form." "The impact of the acute angle of a triangle on a circle is a c t u a l l y as o v e r w h e l m i n g in effect as the finger of G o d t o u c h i n g the finger of A d a m in Michelangelo."
In 1914, F r a n z M a r c w r o t e in his Aphorisms: " M a t t e r is a t h i n g t h a t m a n c a n a t best
tolerate; he refuses to recognize it. T h e contemplation of the world has become the penetration of the world. T h e r e is no mystic w h o , in his moments of sublimest rapture, ever attained the perfect abstraction of modern thought, or took his soundings with a deeper plummet." Paul Klee, who may be regarded as the poet a m o n g m o d e r n p a i n t e r s , says: " I t is t h e artist's mission to penetrate as far as may be toward that secret ground where primal law feeds growth. Which artist would not wish to dwell at the central organ of all motion in space-time (be it the brain or the heart of creation) from which all functions derive their life? In the womb of nature, in the primal ground of creation, where the secret key to all things lies hidden? . . . O u r beating heart drives us downw a r d , far d o w n to the p r i m a l g r o u n d . " W h a t is encountered on this journey "must be taken most seriously w h e n it is perfectly fused w i t h the appropriate artistic means in visible form," because, as Klee a d d s , it is not a question of m e r e l y r e p r o d u c i n g w h a t is seen; " t h e secretly perceived is m a d e visible." Klee's w o r k is rooted in t h a t p r i m a l g r o u n d . " M y h a n d is entirely the i n s t r u m e n t of a m o r e d i s t a n t s p h e r e . N o r is it my head that functions in my w o r k ; it is something else . . . ." In his work the spirit of'nature and the spirit of the unconscious became inseparable. They have drawn him and draw us, the onlookers, into their magic circle.
Klee's work is the most complex expression — now poetic, now demonic — of the chthonic spirit. Humor and bizarre ideas build a bridge from the realm of the dark underworld to the

human world; the bond between his fantasy a n d the e a r t h is the careful o b s e r v a t i o n of the laws of n a t u r e and the love for all creatures. "For the artist," he once wrote, "the dialogue with n a t u r e is t h e conditio sine qua non of his work." A different expression of the h i d d e n u n c o n scious spirit can be found in one of the most notable of the younger " a b s t r a c t " painters, Jackson Pollock, an American who was killed in a car accident when he was 44. His work has had a great influence on the younger artists of o u r t i m e . In My Painting, he revealed t h a t he p a i n t e d in a kind of t r a n c e : " W h e n I a m in m y p a i n t i n g I a m not a w a r e of w h a t I a m d o i n g . It is only after a sort o f ' g e t a c q u a i n t e d ' period that I see what I have been about. I have no fears about making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its o w n . I try to let it c o m e t h r o u g h . It is only w h e n I lose c o n t a c t with the p a i n t i n g t h a t the result is a mess. O t h e r w i s e t h e r e is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well."
Pollock's pictures, which were painted practically unconsciously, arc charged with boundless emotional vehemence. In their lack of structure they are almost chaotic, a glowing lava stream of colors, lines, planes, and points. They may be regarded as a parallel to what the alchemists called the mass a confusa, the prima
materia, or chaos — all ways of defining the precious prime matter of the alchemical process, the starting point of the quest for the essence of being. Pollock's pictures represent the n o t h i n g t h a t is e v e r y t h i n g — t h a t is, the unconscious itself. T h e y seem to live in a time before the emergence of consciousness and being, or to be fantastic landscapes of a time after the extinction of consciousness and being. In the middle ol our century, the purely a b stract p i c t u r e w i t h o u t a n y r e g u l a r o r d e r of forms and colors has become the most frequent expression in painting. T h e deeper the dissolution of "reality," the more the picture loses its symbolic content. T h e reason for this lies in the nature of the symbol and its function. T h e symbol is a n object of the k n o w n world h i n t i n g at s o m e t h i n g u n k n o w n ; it is the k n o w n expressing the life a n d sense of the inexpressible. But in merely abstract paintings, the world of the k n o w n has c o m p l e t e l y v a n i s h e d . N o t h i n g is left to form a bridge to the unknown.
On the other hand, these paintings reveal an unexpected background, a hidden sense. They often turn out to be more or less exact images of n a t u r e itself, showing an astounding similarity with the molecular structure of organic a n d i n o r g a n i c e l e m e n t s of n a t u r e . T h i s is a perplexing fact. Pure abstraction has become an image of concrete nature. But J u n g may give us the key to understanding:



" T h e deeper layers of the psyche," he has said, "lose their individual uniqueness as they retreat farther and fartherintodarkness. 'Lower down," t h a t is to say, as they a p p r o a c h the a u t o nomous functional systems, they become increasingly collective until they arc universalized and extinguished in the body's materiality, i.e. in c h e m i c a l substances. T h e b o d y ' s c a r b o n is simply c a r b o n . H e n c e 'at b o t t o m ' the psyche is simply 'world.' A comparison of abstract paintings and microphotographs shows that utter abstraction of imaginative art has in a secret and surprising way become "naturalistic," its subject being e l e m e n t s of m a t t e r . T h e " g r e a t a b s t r a c t i o n " and the "great realism," which parted at the beginning of our century, have come together again. We remember Kandinsky's words: "The poles o p e n t w o p a t h s , w h i c h both lead to one goal at the e n d . " This "goal," the point of u n i o n , is r e a c h e d in m o d e r n a b s t r a c t p a i n t i n g s . But it is a t t a i n e d c o m p l e t e l y unconsciously. The artist's intention plays no part in the process.
This point leads to a most important fact about modern a r t : T h e artist is, as it were, not so free in his creative work as he may think he is. If his work is p e r f o r m e d in a m o r e or less unconscious w a y , it is controlled by laws of nature that, on the deepest level, correspond to the laws of the psyche, a n d vice versa. T h e great pioneers of modern art gave clearest expression to its true aims and to the depths from w h i c h the spirit rose t h a t left its i m p r i n t on t h e m . T h i s point is i m p o r t a n t , t h o u g h later artists, who may have failed to realize it, did not always plumb the same depths. Yet neither Kandinsky, nor Klee, nor any other of the early masters of modern painting, was ever aware of the grave psychological danger he was undergoing with the mystical submersion in the chthonic spirit and the primal ground of nature. That danger must now be explained.
As a starting point we may take another aspect of abstract art. T h e German writer Wilhelm Worringer interpreted abstract art as the expression of a metaphysical unease and anxiety that seemed to him to be more pronounced among northern peoples. As he explained, they
suffer from reality. T h e naturalness of the s o u t h e r n peoples is d e n i e d to t h e m a n d they long for a super-real and super-sensual world to which they give expression in imaginative or abstract art. But. as Sir Herbert Read remarks in his Concise History of Modern Art, m e t a p h y s i c a l a n x i e t y is n o longer only G e r m a n i c a n d n o r t h ern ; it n o w c h a r a c t e r i z e s the whole of the m o d ern world. Read quotes Klee, who wrote in his Diary at the b e g i n n i n g of 1915: " T h e m o r e horrifying this world b e c o m e s (as it is in these days) the more art becomes abstract; while a world at peace produces realistic art." To Franz Marc, abstraction offered a refuge from the evil and ugliness in this world. " V e r y early in life I felt that m a n was ugly- T h e a n i m a l s seemed to be more lovely and pure, yet even a m o n g them I discovered so much that was revolting and hideous that my painting became more and more schematic and abstract."
A good deal may be learned from a conversation that took place in 1958 between the Italian sculptor Marino Marini and the writer Edouard Roditi. The dominant subject that M a r i n i t r e a t e d for years in m a n y v a r i a t i o n s is the n u d e figure of a y o u t h on a horse. In the early versions, which he described in the conversation as "symbols of hope and gratitude" (after the end of the Second World W a r ) , the rider sits his horse with outstretched arms, his
The paintings of Jackson Pollock (left, h i s / V o 23) w e r e p a i n t e d in a trance (unconsciously) as are the works of other modern artists—such asthe French "action" painter Georges Mathieu (far left).

body bending slightly backward. In the course of years the treatment of the subject became more " a b s t r a c t . " T h e more or less "classical" form of the rider gradually dissolved. Speaking of the feeling underlying this change, Marini said: "If you look at my e q u e s t r i a n statues of t h e last 12 years in o r d e r of time, you will notice that the animal's panic steadily increases, but that it is frozen with terror and stands paralyzed rather than rearing or t a k i n g flight. T h a t is all b e c a u s e I b e lieve that we are approaching the end of the w o r l d . In every figure, I strove to express a deepening fear and despair. In this way I am attempting to symbolize the last stage of a dying myth, the myth of the individual, victorious hero, of the humanist's man of virtue."
In fairy tale and myth, the "victorious hero" is a symbol of consciousness. His defeat, as Marini says himself, means the death of the individual, a p h e n o m e n o n that appears in a social context as the submergence of the individual in the mass, and in art as the decline of the human element. When Roditi asked whether Marini's style was a b a n d o n i n g the classical canon on its way to becoming "abstract," Marini replied, "As soon as art has to express fear, it must of itself depart from the classical ideal." He found subjects for his work in the bodies excavated at Pompeii. Roditi called Marini's art a "Hiroshima style," for it conjures u p visions of the end of a world. Marini admitted it. He felt, he said, as if he had been expelled from an earthly paradise. "Until recently, the sculptor aimed at full sensual a n d powerful^forms. But for the last 15 years, sculpture prefers forms in disintegration."
The conversation between Marini and Roditi explains the transformation of'sensory" art into abstraction that should be clear to anyone who has ever walked open-eyed through an exhibition of modern art. However much he may appreciate or admire its formal qualities, he can scarcely fail to sense the fear, despair, aggression, and mockery that sounds like a cry from many works. The "metaphysical anxiety" that is expressed by the distress in these pictures

and sculptures may have arisen from the despair of a doomed world, as it did with Marini. In other cases, the emphasis may lie on the religious factor, on the feeling t h a t God is d e a d . T h e r e is a close c o n n e c t i o n b e t w e e n the two. At the root of this inner distress lies the defeat (or rather the retreat) of consciousness. In the upsurge of mystical experience, everything that once bound man to the human world, to earth, to time and space, to matter and the natural living of life, has been cast aside or dissolved. But unless t h e unconscious is balanced by the experience of consciousness, it will implacably reveal its contrary or negative aspect. T h e wealth of creative sound that made the h a r m o n y of the spheres, or the wonderful mysteries of the primal ground, have yielded to destruction and despair. In more than one case the artist has become the passive victim of the unconscious.
In physics, too, the world of the background has revealed its paradoxical nature; the laws of the inmost elements of nature, the newly discovered structures and relations in its basic unit, the atom, have become the scientific foundation for unprecedented weapons of destruction, and opened the way to annihilation. Ultimate knowledge and the destruction of the world are the two aspects of the discovery of the primal ground of nature. J u n g , who was as familiar with the dangerous dual nature of the unconscious as with the
Top left and center, t w o sculptures by Marino Marini (1901 -66), from 1945 and 1951 respectively, show how the theme of horse and rider was altered from an expression of tranquility to one of tortured fear and despair, while the sculptures themselves grew correspondingly more and more abstract. Marini's later work was influenced by the equally panic-stricken shapes of bodies found at Pompeii (left).
importance of h u m a n consciousness, could offer mankind only one weapon against catastrophe: the call for individual consciousness, which seems so simple a n d yet is so a r d u o u s . Consciousness is not only i n d i s p e n s a b l e as a counterpoise to the unconscious, and not only gives the possibility of meaning to life. It has also an eminently practical function. T h e evil witnessed in the world outside, in neighbors or neighboring peoples, can be made conscious as evil contents of our own psyche as well, and this insight w o u l d be the first step to a r a d i c a l change in our attitude to our neighbors.
Envy, lust, sensuality, lies, and all known vices are the negative, " d a r k " aspect of the unconscious, which can manifest itself in two ways. In the positive sense, it appears as a "spirit of nature," creatively animating man, things, a n d t h e w o r l d . I t is t h e " c h t h o n i c spirit" that has been mentioned so often in this chapter. In the negative sense, the unconscious (that same spirit) manifests itself as a spirit of evil, as a drive to destroy.
As has already been pointed out, the alchemists personified this spirit as "the spirit Mercur i u s " a n d called it, w i t h good reason, Mercurius duplex (the two-faced, d u a l M e r c u r i u s ) . I n the religious l a n g u a g e of C h r i s t i a n i t y , it is called the devil. But, however improbable it may seem, the devil too has a dual aspect. In the positive sense, he appears as Lucifer—literally, the light-bringer. Looked at in the light of these difficult and paradoxical ideas, modern art (which we have recognized as symbolic of the chthonic spirit) also has a dual aspect. In the positive sense it is the expression of a mysteriously profound nature-mysticism; in the negative, it can only be interpreted as the expression of an evil- or destructive spirit. The two sides belong together, for the p a r a d o x is o n e of the basic qualities of the unconscious and its contents. T o prevent any misunderstanding, it must once more be emphasized that these considerations have nothing to do with artistic and aesthetic values, but are solely concerned with the interpretation of modern art as a symbol of our time.

Union of opposites
T h e r e is one m o r e p o i n t to be m a d e . T h e spirit of the age is in c o n s t a n t m o v e m e n t . It is like a river t h a t flows on, invisibly b u t surely, and given the m o m e n t u m of life in our century, even 10 years is a long t i m e . About the middle of this century a change began to come over painting. It was nothing revolutionary, nothing like the change that happened about 1910, which meant the reconstruction of art to its very foundations. But there were groups of artists who formulated their aims in ways not heard before. This transformation is going on within the frontiers of abstract painting. The representation of concrete reality, which springs from the primal h u m a n need of catching the passing moment on the wing, has become a truly concrete sensuous art in the photography of such men as France's Henri CartierBresson, Switzerland's Werner Bischof, and others. We can therefore understand why artists continued on their own way of inwardness and imagination. For a good many of the young artists, however, abstract art as it had been practiced for m a n y years offered no a d v e n t u r e , no field of c o n q u e s t . Seeking t h e n e w , they found it in w h a t lay nearest, yet h a d been lost — in nature and man. They were not and are not concerned with the reproduction of nature in pictures, but with the expression of their own emotional experience of nature.
The French painter Alfred Manessier defined the aims of his art in these words: " W h a t we have to r e c o n q u e r is the weight of lost reality. We must make for ourselves a new heart, a new spirit, a new soul, in the measure of man. T h e painter's true reality lies neither in abstraction nor in realism, but in the reconquest of his weight as a h u m a n being. At present non-figurative art seems to me to offer the one opportunity for the painter to a p p r o a c h the inward reality of himself and to grasp the consciousness of his essential self, or even of his being. It is
only by the rcconquest of his position, I believe, that the painter will be able, in the time to come, to return slowly to himself, to rediscover his own weight and so to strengthen it that it can even reach the outward reality of the world." J e a n B a z a i n e speaks in similar t e r m s : " I t is a great temptation for the painter of today to paint the pure rhythm of his feeling, the most secret pulse of his heart, instead of embodying it in a concrete form. T h a t , however, leads only to a desiccated mathematics or a kind of abstract expressionism, which ends in monotony and a progressive impoverishment of form. . . . But a form that can reconcile man with his world is a n 'art of c o m m u n i o n ' by w h i c h m a n , at any moment, can recognize his own unformed countenance in the world."
W h a t in fact artists n o w h a v e at h e a r t is a conscious reunion of their own inward reality with the reality of the world or of n a t u r e ; or, in the last resort, a new union of body and soul, m a t t e r a n d spirit. T h a t is their w a y to the " r e conquest of their weight as h u m a n beings." O n l y n o w is the g r e a t rift t h a t set in w i t h modern art (between "great abstraction" and "great realism") being made conscious and on the way to being healed.
F o r the onlooker, this first b e c o m e s evident in the changed atmosphere in the works of these artists. T h e r e radiates from the pictures of such artists as Alfred Manessier or the Belgian-born painter Gustave Singier, in spite of all abstraction, a belief in the world, and, in spite of all intensity of feeling, a h a r m o n y of forms and colors that often attains serenity. In the French painter Jean Lurcat's famous tapestries of the
268
In this century the depiction of actuality—once the province of the painter and sculptor—has been taken over by the photographer, whose camera can not only record but (like any landscape painting of past centuries) can express the photographer's own emotional experience of the subject. Right, a Japanese scene photographed by Werner Bischof (1916-54).






1950s the exuberance of nature pervades the picture. His art could be called sensuous as well as imaginative. We find a serene harmony of forms and colors also in the work of Paul Klee. This harmony was what he had always been striving for. Above all, he had realized the necessity of not denying evil. "Even evil must not be a triumphant or degrading enemy, but a power collaborating in the whole." But Klee's starting point was not the same. He lived near "the dead and the unborn" at an almost cosmic distance from this world, while the younger generation of painters can be said to be more firmly rooted in e a r t h .
An i m p o r t a n t point to notice is t h a t m o d e r n painting, just when it has advanced far enough to discern the union of the opposites, has taken up religious themes. The "metaphysical void" seems to have been overcome. And the utterly unexpected has happened: The Church has become a patron of modern art. We need only mention here All Saints at Basle, with windows by Alfred Manessier; Assy church, with pictures by a large number of modern artists; the Matisse chapel at Vence; and the church at Audincourt, which has works by Jean Bazaine and the French artist Fernand Leger.
The admission of modern art to the Church means more than an act of broadmindedness
on the p a r t of its p a t r o n s . It is symbolic of the fact that the part played by modern art in relation to C h r i s t i a n i t y is c h a n g i n g . T h e c o m p e n satory function of the old hermetic movements has m a d e way for the possibility of collaboration. In discussing the animal symbols of Christ, it was pointed out that the light a n d the chthonic spirits belonged to each other. It seems as if the m o m e n t h a d c o m e t o d a y w h e n a new stage in the solution of this millennial problem might be reached.
What the future will yield we cannot know whether the bridging of the opposites will give positive results, or whether the way will lead through yet more unimaginable catastrophes. T h e r e is too m u c h a n x i e t y a n d too m u c h d r e a d at work in the world, a n d this is still the predominant factor in art and society. Above all, t h e r e is still too m u c h unwillingness on the p a r t of the individual to apply to himself and his life the conclusions that can be d r a w n from art, although he might be ready to accept them in art. The artist can often express many things, unconsciously and without awakening hostility, which are resented when they are expressed by a psychologist (a fact that could be demonstrated even more conclusively in literature than in the visual arts). Confronted by the statements of the psychologist, the individual feels directly challenged; but what the artist has to say, particu
270



larly in our century, usually remains in an impersonal sphere. And yet it seems important that the suggestion of a more whole, and therefore more human, form of expression should have bec o m e visible in o u r t i m e . It is a g l i m m e r of hope, symbolized for me (at the time of writing: 1961) by a number of paintings by the French artist Pierre Soulages. Behind a cataract of huge, black rafters there glimmers a clear, pure blue or a r a d i a n t yellow. Light is d a w n ing behind darkness.
Mid-20th-century art seems to be moving away from a Marini-like d e s p a i r — a s is seen in the gesture of Jean Lurcat, w h o exhibited his work in a field (top left), a link with nature and the earth. Above, Dedicace a Sainte Marie Madeleine by Alfred Manessier (born 1911). T o p right, Pour la Naissance du
Surhomme by F r a n c e ' s P i e r r e - Y v e s Tremois (born 1921) Both works indicate a tendency toward life and wholeness. The painting, right, by Pierre Soulages (born 1919) might be understood as a symbol of hope: Behind the cataclysmic darkness can be seen a glimmer of light.

The beginning of the analysis
T h e r e is a w i d e s p r e a d belief t h a t the m e t h o d s of J u n g i a n psychology are applicable only to middle-aged people. True, many men and women reach middle age without achieving psychological m a t u r i t y , a n d it is therefore necessary to help them through the neglected phases of their development. T h e y have not c o m p l e t e d the first p a r t of the process of i n d i viduation that Dr. M.-L. von Franz has described. But it is also t r u e t h a t a y o u n g person can encounter serious problems as he grows up. If a y o u n g person is afraid of life a n d finds it hard to adjust to reality, he might prefer to dwell in his fantasies or to remain a child. In such a y o u n g person (especially if he is i n t r o verted) one can sometimes discover unexpected treasures in the unconscious, and by bringing them into consciousness strengthen his ego and give him the psychic energy he needs to grow into a m a t u r e person. T h a t is the function of the powerful symbolism of our dreams.
Other contributors to this book have described the nature of these symbols and the role they play in man's psychological nature. I wish to show how analysis can aid the individuation process by taking the example of a young engineer, aged 25, whom I shall call Henry. Henry came from a rural district in eastern Switzerland. His father, of Protestant peasant stock, was a general practitioner: Henry described him as a m a n with high moral standards, but a rather withdrawn person who found it difficult to relate to other people. He was more of a father to his patients than to his children. At home, Henry's mother was the dominant personality. "We were raised by the strong hand of our m o t h e r , " he said on one occasion. She came from a family with an academic background and wide artistic interests. She herself, in spite of h e r strictness, h a d a b r o a d spiritual horizon; she was impulsive and romantic (she had a great love for Italy). T h o u g h she was by birth a Catholic, her children had been
brought up in the Protestantism of their father. Henry had a sister, older than himself, with whom he had a good relationship. H e n r y was i n t r o v e r t e d , shy, finely d r a w n , and very tall, with light hair, a high pale forehead, and blue eyes with dark shadows. He did not think that neurosis (the most usual reason) had brought him to me, but rather an inner urge to work on his psyche. A strong mothertie, however, and a fear of committing himself to life were hidden behind this u r g e ; but these were only discovered during the analytical work with me. He had just completed his studies and taken a position in a large factory, and he was facing the many problems of a young man on the threshold of manhood. " I t appears to m e , " he wrote in a letter asking for an interview, " t h a t this phase of my life is particularly important and meaningful. I must decide either to remain unconscious in a well-protected security, or else to venture on a yet unknown way of which I have great hopes." T h e choice thus confronting him was whether to remain a lonely, vacillating, and unrealistic youth or to become a self-sufficient and responsible adult.
Henry told me that he preferred books to society; he felt inhibited a m o n g people, and was often tormented by doubts and self-criticism. He was well read for his age and had a leaning toward aesthetic intellectualism. After an earlier atheistic stage, he became rigorously P r o t e s t a n t , b u t finally his religious a t t i t u d e became completely neutral. He had chosen a technical education because he felt his talents lay in mathematics and geometry. He possessed a logical mind, trained in the natural sciences, but he also had a propensity toward the irrational and mystical that he did not want to admit even to himself.
About two years before his analysis began, Henry had become engaged to a Catholic girl from the French part of Switzerland. He described her as c h a r m i n g , efficient, and full of
274

initiative. Nevertheless, he was uncertain whether he should undertake the responsibility of marriage. Since he had so little a c q u a i n t a n c e with girls, he thought it might be better to wait, or even to remain a bachelor dedicated to a scholarly life. His doubts were strong enough to prevent his reaching a decision; he needed a further step toward maturity before he could feel sure of himself. Although qualities of both'his parents were combined in Henry, he was markedly motherbound. In his consciousness,'he was identified with his real (or "light") mother, who represented high ideals and intellectual ambitions. But in his unconscious he was deeply in the power of the dark aspects of his mother-bound condition. His unconscious still held his ego in a strangle-hold. All his clear-cut thinking and his efforts to find a firm s t a n d p o i n t in t h e purely rational remained nothing more than an intellectual exercise.
The need to escape from this "motherprison" was expressed in hostile reactions to his real mother and a rejection of the "inner mother" as a symbol of the feminine side of the unconscious. But an inner power sought to hold him back in the condition of childhood, resisting everything that attracted him to the outside world. Even the attractions of his fiancee were not enough to free him from his mother-ties, a n d thus h e l p him find himself. H e
was not aware that his inner urge for growth (which he felt strongly) included the need to detach himself from his mother. My analytical work with Henry lasted nine months. Altogether, there were 35 sessions in which he presented 50 dreams. So short an analysis is r a r e . It is only possible w h e n energyladen dreams like Henry's speed up the process of development. O f course, from the J u n g i a n point of view, there is no rule for the length of time required for a successful analysis. All depends on the individual's readiness to realize inner facts and on the material presented by his unconscious.
Like most introverts, Henry led a rather monotonous outer life. During the day he was completely involved in his job. In the evenings he sometimes went out with his fiancee or with friends, with whom he liked to have literary discussions. Quite often he sat in his lodgings absorbed in a book or in his own thoughts. Though we regularly discussed the happenings of his daily life, and also his childhood and youth, we usually got fairly quickly to the investigation of his dreams and the problems his inner life presented to him. It was extraordinary to see how strongly his dreams emphasized his "call" to spiritual development.
But I must make it clear that not everything described here was told to Henry. In analysis one must always remain conscious of how ex

plosive the dreamer's dream symbols may be for him. The analyst can hardly be too careful a n d reserved. If too b r i g h t a light is t h r o w n on the dream-language of symbols, the dreamer can be driven into anxiety, and thus led into rationalization as a defense mechanism. O r he can no longer assimilate them, and can fall into a severe psychic crisis. Also, the dreams reported and commented on here arc by no means all the dreams that Henry had during his analysis. I can discuss only an important few that influenced his development.
In the beginning of our work, childhood memories with important symbolic meanings came up. The oldest dated back to Henry's fourth year. He said: "One morning I was allowed to go with my mother to the baker's shop and there I received a crescent roll from the baker's wife. I did not eat the roll but carried it p r o u d l y in my h a n d . O n l y my m o t h e r and the baker's wife were present, so I was the only man." Such crescents are popularly called "moon-teeth," and this symbolic allusion to the moon underlines the dominating power of the feminine a power to which the little boy may have felt exposed a n d which, as the "only m a n , " he was proud of being able to confront.
Another childhood memory came from his fifth year. It c o n c e r n e d H e n r y ' s sister, w h o came home after her examinations at school and found him constructing a toy barn. The barn was made with blocks of wood arranged in the form of a square and surrounded with a kind of hedge that looked like the battlem e n t s of a castle. H e n r y was pleased with his achievement, and said teasingly to his sister: "You have started school but you're already on holiday." Her reply, that he was on holiday all year, upset him terribly. He felt deeply hurt that his "achievement" was not taken seriously. Even years later Henry had not forgotten the bitter hurt a n d injustice that he had felt when his construction was rejected. His later p r o b l e m s c o n c e r n i n g the assertion of his m a s culinity and the conflict between rational and fantasy values are already visible in this early experience. And these problems are also to be seen in the images of his first d r e a m .

The initial dream
T h e d a y after H e n r y ' s first visit to m e , he h a d the following dream:
I was on an excursion with a group of people I did not know. We were going to the Zinalrothorn. We had started from Samaden. We only walked about an hour because we were to camp and have some theatricals. I was not given an active part. I especially remember one performer —a young woman in a pathetic role wearing a long flowing robe. It was midday and I wanted to go on to the pass. As all the others preferred to remain, I went up alone, leaving my equipment behind. However, I found myself right back in the valley and completely lost my orientation. I wanted to return to my party but did not know which mountainside I should climb. I was hesitant about asking. Finally, an old woman showed me the way I must go. Then I ascended from a different starting point than our group had used in the morning. It was a matter of making a turn at the right altitude and then following the mountain slope to return to the party. I climbed 'along a cogwheel mountain railway on the right side. On my left little cars constantly passed me, each containing one hidden bloated little man in a blue suit. It is said they are dead. I was afraid of other cars coming from behind and kept turning around to look, so as not to be run over. My anxiety was needless. At the point where I had to turn off. to the right, there were people awaiting me. They took me to an inn. A cloudburst came up. I regretted that my equipment my rucksack, and my motor bike—were not there, but I was told not to get them till next morning. I accepted the advice.
One of Henry's childhood memories involved a crescent roll, which he drew (top left). Center, the same shape on a modern Swiss bakery sign. The crescent shape has long been linked with the moon and thus with the feminine principle, as in the crown (left) of the goddess Ishtar of third-century B.C. Babylon.
Dr. J u n g assigned great importance to the first d r e a m in a n analysis, for, a c c o r d i n g to him, it often has anticipatory value. A decision to go into analysis is usually a c c o m p a n i e d by an emotional upheaval that disturbs the deep psychic levels from which archetypal symbols arise. T h e first d r e a m s therefore often present "collective images" that provide a perspective for the analysis as a whole and can give the therapist insight into the dreamer's psychic conflicts.
W h a t does the above dream tell us of Henry's future d e v e l o p m e n t ? W e m u s t first e x a m i n e some of the associations that Henry himself supplied. T h e village of Samaden had been the home of Jiirg Jenatsch, a famous 17th-century Swiss freedom-fighter. T h e "theatricals" called u p the t h o u g h t of G o e t h e ' s Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre, w h i c h H e n r y liked very m u c h . I n t h e w o m a n h e saw a r e s e m b l a n c e to t h e figure in a p a i n t i n g called The Island of Ihe Dead by the 19th-century Swiss artist Arnold Bocklin. T h e "wise old w o m a n , " as he called her, seemed to be associated on the one hand to his analyst, on the other to the charwoman in J . B. Priestley's p l a y They Came to a City. T h e cog-wheel railway reminded him of the barn (with battlements) that he had built as a child.
T h e d r e a m describes an "excursion" (a sort of " w a l k i n g t o u r " ) , which is a striking parallel to Henry's decision to undertake analysis. The individuation process is often symbolized by a voyage of discovery to unknown lands. Such a v o y a g e takes p l a c e in J o h n B u n y a n ' s Pilgrim's Progress, or in D a n t e ' s Divina Commedia. T h e "traveler" in Dante's poem, searching for a way, comes to a mountain that he decides to climb. But because of three strange animals (a motif that will also appear in one of Henry's later d r e a m s ) he is forced to d e s c e n d i n t o the valley and even into hell. (Later he ascends a g a i n to p u r g a t o r y a n d finally r e a c h e s p a r a dise.) From this parallel one could deduce that
277



The initial stage of the process of individuation can sometimes be a period of disorientation—as was the case with Henry.

One of the central characters is a c h a r w o m a n , left of picture.
there might be a similar period of disorientation and lonely seeking in store for Henry. The first p a r t of this life-journey, r e p r e s e n t e d as climbing a mountain, offers ascent from the u n c o n s c i o u s to a n elevated p o i n t of view of the ego i.e. to an increased consciousness. S a m a d e n is n a m e d as the starting point of the excursion. T h i s is w h e r e J e n a t s c h ( w h o m we may take as embodying the "freedom-seeking" sense within Henry's unconscious) started his c a m p a i g n for the l i b e r a t i o n of the Veltlin region of Switzerland from the French. Jenatsch had other characteristics in common with H e n r y : H e was a P r o t e s t a n t w h o fell in love with a Catholic girl; and, like Henry, whose analysis was to free him from his motherties and from fear of life, Jenatsch also fought for liberation. O n e could interpret this as a favorable augury for the success of Henry's own fight for freedom. T h e goal of the excursion is the Zinalrothorn, a mountain in western Switz e r l a n d t h a t he d i d not k n o w . T h e w o r d rol ("red") in Zinalro/horn touches on Henry's e m o t i o n a l p r o b l e m . R e d is usually symbolic of feeling or passion; here it points to the value of the feeling-function, which was insufficiently developed in Henry. And the word " h o r n " reminds one of the crescent roll in the baker's shop of Henry's childhood.
After a short walk, a halt is called, a n d Henry can return to a state of passivity. This
also belongs to his n a t u r e . T h e p o i n t is u n d e r lined by the "theatricals." Attending the theatre (which is a n i m i t a t i o n of real life) is a p o p u l a r way of evading an active part in life's drama. The spectator can identify with the play, yet continue to pander to his fantasies. This kind of identification permitted the Greeks to experience catharsis, much as the psycho-drama initiated by the American psychiatrist J. L. Moreno is now used as a t h e r a p e u t i c aid. S o m e such process may have enabled Henry to undergo an inner development when his associations raised m e m o r i e s of Wilhelm Meisler, G o e t h e ' s story of the m a t u r i n g of a y o u n g m a n .
That Henry should have been impressed by the r o m a n t i c a p p e a r a n c e of a w o m a n is also not surprising. This figure resembles Henry's m o t h e r a n d is at t h e s a m e t i m e a personification of his own unconscious feminine side. The connection Henr\ makes between her and Bocklin's Island of Ihe Dead points to his depressive mood, so well expressed by the painting, which shows a white-robed priest-like figure steering a boat bearing a coffin toward an island. We have here a significant double p a r a d o x : T h e keel of the boat seems to suggest a contrary course, away from the island; a n d the " p r i e s t " is a figure of u n c e r t a i n sex. In H e n r y ' s associations, this figure is certainly hermaphroditic. The double paradox coincides with Henry's ambivalence: The opposites in

his soul are still too undifferentiated to be clearly separated. After this interlude in the dream. Henry s u d d e n l y becomes a w a r e t h a t it is noon a n d he must go on. So he again starts for the pass. A m o u n t a i n pass is a well-known symbol for a "situation of transition" that leads from an old a t t i t u d e of m i n d to a n e w o n e . H e n r y m u s t go a l o n e ; it is essential for his ego to s u r m o u n t the test unaided. Thus he leaves his kit behind an action that signifies that his mental equipment has become a burden, or that he must c h a n g e his n o r m a l w a y of g o i n g a b o u t things. But he does not reach the pass. He loses his bearings and finds himself back in the valley. This failure shows that while Henry's ego decides on activity, his other psychic entities (rep r e s e n t e d by the o t h e r m e m b e r s of t h e p a r t y ) remain in the old state of passivity and refuse to accompany the ego. (When the dreamer himself appears in a dream, he usually represents only his conscious e g o ; the o t h e r figures stand for his more or less u n k n o w n , unconscious qualities.) H e n r y is in a situation where he is helpless, yet ashamed to admit it. At this moment he meets an old woman who indicates the right way to him. He can do nothing but accept her a d v i c e . The helpful " o l d w o m a n " is a well-known symbol in myths a n d fairy talcs for the wisdom of the eternal female nature. T h e
rationalist Henry hesitates to accept her help b e c a u s e such a c c e p t a n c e r e q u i r e s a sacrificium intelleclus—a sacrifice, or d i s c a r d i n g , of a r a t i o n a l w a y of t h o u g h t . ( T h i s d e m a n d will often be made of Henry in later dreams.) Such a sacrifice is u n a v o i d a b l e ; it applies to his relationship with the analysis as well as with everyday life. H e associated the figure of the " o l d w o m a n " to the charwoman in Priestley's play about a new " d r e a m " city (perhaps an analogy to the New Jersusalem of the Apocalypse) into which the characters can enter only after a kind of initiation. This association seems to show that Henry had intuitively recognized this confrontation as something decisive for him. T h e charw o m a n in Priestley's play says that in the city "they have promised me a room of my own." There she will be self-reliant and independent, as Henry seeks to be.
If such a technically minded young man as H e n r y is consciously to choose the way of psychic development, he must be prepared for a reversal of his old attitudes. Therefore, on the advice of the woman, he must start his climb from a different spot. Only then will it be possible for him to judge at what level he must deviate to reach the group — the other qualities of his psyche that he had left b e h i n d . 1 le climbs a cog-wheel rail\va\ track a motif perhaps reflecting his technical education) and

keeps to the right side of t h e track — w h i c h is the conscious side. (In the history of symbolism, the right side generally represents the realm of consciousness; the left, the unconscious.) From the left, little cars are coming down, and in each a little m a n is h i d d e n . H e n r y is afraid t h a t an unnoticed upward-bound car might hit him from the rear. His anxiety proves groundless, b u t it reveals t h a t H e n r y is afraid of w h a t , so to speak, lies behind his ego. The bloated, blue-clothed men might symbolize sterile intellectual thoughts that are being brought down mechanically. Blue often denotes the function of thinking. T h u s the
men might be symbols of ideas or attitudes that have died on the intellectual heights where the air is too thin. T h e y could also represent lifeless inner parts of Henry's psyche. A c o m m e n t on these m e n is m a d e in the d r e a m : " I t is said they a r e d e a d . " But H e n r y is a l o n e . W h o m a k e s this s t a t e m e n t ? It is a voice — a n d w h e n a voice is h e a r d in a d r e a m it is a most meaningful o c c u r r e n c e . Dr. J u n g identified the appearance of a voice in dreams with an intervention of the Self. It stands for a knowledge that has its roots in the collective fundaments of the psyche. What the voice says cannot be disputed.
The insight Henry has gained about the "dead" formulas, to which he has been too committed, marks a turning point in the dream. H e has at last reached the right place for taking a new direction, to the right (the conscious direction), toward the conscious and the outer w o r l d . T h e r e he finds t h e p e o p l e he left b e h i n d waiting for h i m ; and thus he can become conscious of previously unknown aspects of his personality. Since his ego has surmounted the dangers it confronted alone (an accomplishment that could make him more mature and stable), he can rejoin the group or "collective" and get shelter and food.
Then comes the rain, a cloudburst that relaxes tension and makes the earth fertile. In mythology, rain was often thought to be a "love-union" between heaven and earth. In the Eleusinian mysteries, for instance, after everything had been purified by water, the call went u p to h e a v e n : " L e t it r a i n ! " and down to
Left, the Greek maiden Danae, w h o was impregnated by Zeus in the form of a shower of gold (from a painting by the 16th century Flemish artist Jan Gossaert) Like Henry's dream, this myth reflects the symbolism of the cloudburst as a sacred marriage between heaven and earth.
In another of Henry's dreams a doe appears - an image of shy femininity as is the f a w n in the painting, right, by the 19th century British artist Edwin Landseer



earth: "Be fruitful!" This was understood as a sacred marriage of the gods. In this way rain can be said to represent a "solution" in the literal sense of the word. Coming down, Henry again meets the collective values symbolized by the rucksack and motorcycle. He has passed through a phase in which he has strengthened his ego-consciousness by proving he can hold his own, and he has a renewed need for social contact. However, he accepts the suggestion of his friends that he should wait and fetch his things the next morning. T h u s he submits for the second time to advice that comes from elsewhere: the first time, to the advice of the old woman, to a subjective power, an archetypal figure; the second time, to a collective pattern. With this step Henry has passed a milestone on the road to maturity.
As an anticipation of the inner development that Henry could hope to achieve through analysis, this dream was extraordinarily promising. The conflicting opposites that kept H e n r y s soul in tension were impressively symbolized. O n the one hand, there was his conscious urge to ascend, and on the other his tendency to passive contemplation. Also, the image of the pathetic young w o m a n in her white robes (representing Henry's sensitive and romantic feelings) contrasts with the bloated corpses in blue suits (representing his sterile intellectual world). However, to overcome these obstacles and bring about a balance between them would be possible for Henry only after the most severe trials.
Fear of the unconscious
T h e problems we encountered in Henry's initial dream showed u p in many others problems like vacillation between masculine activity and feminine passivity, or a tendency to hide behind intellectual asceticism. He feared the world, yet was attracted to it. Fundamentally, he feared the obligations of marriage, which demanded that he form a responsible relationship with a w o m a n . Such an a m b i v a l e n c e is not unusual for someone on the threshold of manhood. T h o u g h in terms of age Henry had left that phase behind him, his inner m a t u r i t y did not m a t c h his years. T h i s p r o b l e m is often met in the introvert, with his fear of reality and outer life.
The fourth dream that Henry recounted provided a striking illustration of his psychological state:
It seems to me that I have had this dream endless times. Military service, long-distance race. Alone I go on my way. I never reach the goal. Will I be the last? T h e course is well known to me, all of it deja vu. T h e start is in a little wood, and the ground is covered with dry leaves. The terrain slopes gently to an idyllic little brook that invites one to tarry. Later, there is a dusty country road. It leads toward Hombrechtikon, a small village near the upper lake of Zurich. A brook bordered by willows similar to a painting of Bocklin's in which a dreamy female figure follows the course of the water. Night falls. In a village I ask for directions to the road. I am told the road leads on for seven hours over a pass. I gather myself together and go on. However, this time the end of the dream differs. After the willow-bordered brook I get into a wood. There I discover a doe that runs away. I am proud of this observation. The doe has appeared on the left side and now I turn to the right. Here I see three strange creatures, hall pig, half dog, with the legs of a kangaroo. The faces are quite undifferentiated, with large drooping dog ears. Maybe they are costumed people. As a boy, I once masqueraded in the circus costume of a donkey.

The b e g i n n i n g of the d r e a m is conspicuously like Henry's initial dream. A dreamlike female figure again appears, and the setting of the d r e a m is associated with a n o t h e r p a i n t i n g by Bocklin. T h i s p a i n t i n g , called Autumn 'Thoughts, a n d the d r y leaves m e n t i o n e d earlier in the d r e a m underline the a u t u m n a l mood. A romantic atmosphere also reappears in this dream. Apparently this inner landscape, representing H e n r y ' s m e l a n c h o l y , is very familiar to h i m . Again he is in a collective of p e o p l e , b u t this time with military comrades on a longdistance race.
This whole situation (as the military service also suggests) might be regarded as a representation of an average man's fate. Henry himself said: "It's a symbol of life." But the dreamer does not want to adjust to it. He goes on alone - which was probably always the case with H e n r y . T h a t is w h y he has t h e i m p r e s sion t h a t e v e r y t h i n g is dejci vu. His t h o u g h t ("I never reach the goal") indicates strong feelings of inferiority a n d a belief t h a t he c a n n o t win the "long-distance race." His way leads to Hornbrechtikon, a name t h a t r e m i n d s h i m of his secret p l a n s to b r e a k a w a y from h o m e (Horn = h o m e , brechen = to break). But because this breaking away does not occur, he again (as in the initial dream) loses his sense of o r i e n t a t i o n a n d must ask for directions. Dreams compensate more or less explicitly for the d r e a m e r ' s conscious a t t i t u d e of mind.
T h e r o m a n t i c , m a i d e n l y figure of H e n r y ' s conscious ideal is b a l a n c e d by the a p p e a r a n c e of the strange, female-like animals. Henry's world of instincts is symbolized by s o m e t h i n g feminine. T h e w o o d is a symbol of an unconscious a r e a , a d a r k p l a c e w h e r e a n i m a l s live. At first a d o e — a s y m b o l of shy, fugitive, i n n o c e n t womanliness — emerges, but only for a moment. T h e n Henry sees three mixed-up animals of a strange and repulsive appearance. They seem to represent undifferentiated instinctuality — a sort of confused mass of his instincts, containing the raw material for a later development. T h e i r most striking c h a r a c t e r i s t i c is t h a t they are all virtually faceless, and thus without the slightest glimmerings of consciousness.
In the minds of m a n y people, the pig is closely associated to dirty sexuality. (Circe, for example, changed the men who desired her into swine.) T h e dog may stand for loyalty, but also for promiscuity, because it shows no d i s c r i m i n a t i o n in its choice of p a r t n e r s . T h e k a n g a r o o , h o w e v e r , is often a symbol for m o t h erliness and tender carrying capacity. All these animals present only rudimentary traits, and even these are senselessly contaminated. In alchemy, the "prime material" was often represented by such monstrous and fabulous c r e a t u r e s m i x e d forms of a n i m a l s . In psychological terms, they would probably symbolize the original total unconsciousness, out of which the individual ego can rise and begin to develop toward maturity.
Left, Henry's drawing of the strange animals of his dream. They are mute and blind, unable to communicate, and so represent his unconscious state The animal on the ground (which he colored green, the color of vegetation and nature, and in folk lore a symbol of hope) hints at possibilities of growth and a chance of differentiation.



Henry's fear of the monsters becomes evident by his attempt to make them seem harmless. He wants to convince himself that they are only dressed-up people, like himself in a boyhood m a s q u e r a d e . His anxiety is n a t u r a l . A man discovering such inhuman monsters in his inner self, as symbols of c e r t a i n traits of his unconscious, has every reason to be afraid. Another dream also shows Henry's fear of the depths of the unconscious:
I am a cabin boy in a sailing boat. Paradoxically, the sails are spread, though there is a complete calm. My task consists of holding a rope that serves to fasten a mast. Strangely enough, the railing is a wall covered with stone slabs. This whole structure lies exactly on the border betwren the water and the sailing boat that floats there alone. I hold fast to the rope (not to the mast) and I am forbidden to look into the water.
In this d r e a m H e n r y is in a psychological b o r d e r l i n e situation. The railing is a wall that protects him but at the same time obstructs his view. H e is f o r b i d d e n to look into the w a t e r (where he might discover unknown powers). All these images reveal his doubt and fear. The m a n w h o fears t h e c o m m u n i c a t i o n s of his i n n e r d e p t h s (like H e n r y ) is as m u c h afraid of the feminine e l e m e n t in himself as he is of real w o m e n . At o n e m o m e n t he is fascinated by her, at another he tries to escape; fascinated and terrified, he flees so as not to become her
"prey." He does not dare to approach a beloved (and therefore idealized) partner with his animal-like sexuality. As a typical result of his mother-tie, Henry had difficulty in giving both feeling and sensuality to the same woman. Again and again his d r e a m s b r o u g h t proof of his desire to free h i m sell from this d i l e m m a In o n e d r e a m he was a "monk on a secret mission." In another, his instincts tempted him into a brothel:
Together with a military comrade who has had many erotic adventures I find myself waiting in front of a house on a dark street in an unknown city. Entrance is permitted only to women. Therefore, in the hall, my friend puts on a little carnival mask of a woman's face and goes up the stairs. Possibly I did the same as he, but I do not remember clearlv.
What this d r e a m proposes would satisfy Henry's curiosity — but only at the price of a fraud. As a man he lacks the courage to enter the house, w h i c h is obviously a b r o t h e l . But if he divests himself of his masculinity, he might gain an insight into this forbidden world forbidden by his conscious mind. The dream, however, does not tell us whether he decides to enter. Henry had not yet overcome his inhibitions an u n d e r s t a n d a b l e failure if we consider the implications of going into the brothel.
The above dream seemed to me to reveal a homoerotic strain in Henry: He appeared to feel that a feminine " m a s k " would m a k e him
The pig like animal of the dream connotes bestiality and lustfulnessas in the myth of Circe, w h o turned men into swine Above left, from a Greek vase, a pig-man, Odysseus, and Circe, Right, in one of the cartoons by George Grosz attacking pre war German society, a man (with a prostitute) is g i v e n a pig's head to show his vulgarity



attractive to men. This hypothesis was supported by the following dream:
The saint and the prostitute
I find myself back in rny fifth or sixth year. My playmate of those days tells me how he participated in an obscene act with the director of a factory. My friend laid his right hand on the man's penis to keep it warm and at the same time to warm his own hand. The director was an intimate friend of my father's whom I venerated for his broad and varied interests. But he was laughed at by us as an "eternal youth."
F o r c h i l d r e n of t h a t a g e h o m o e r o t i c p l a y is not unusual. T h a t H e n r y still came to it in his d r e a m suggests that it was loaded with guilt feelings, and therefore strongly repressed. Such feelings were linked to his deep fear about forming a lasting tie with a woman. Another dream and its associations illustrated this conflict:
I take part in the wedding of an unknown couple. At one in the morning the little wedding party returns from the festivities—the bridal couple, the best man, and the maid of honor. They enter a large courtyard where I await them. It seems that the newlyweds have already had a quarrel, as well as the other couple. They finally find the solution by having the two men and the two women retire separately.
Henry explained: "You see here the war of the sexes as Giraudoux describes it." And then he a d d e d : " T h e palace in Bavaria, where I remember seeing this dream-courtyard, has until lately been disfigured by emergency housing for poor people. W h e n I visited there, I asked myself if it would not be preferable to eke out a poor existence in the ruins of classic b e a u t y t h a n to lead an active life s u r r o u n d e d by the ugliness of a great city. I also asked myself when I was a witness at the wedding of a comrade whether his marriage would last, for his bride m a d e an unfavorable impression on me." The longing to withdraw into passivity and introversion, the fear of an unsuccessful marriage, the dream's separation of the sexes — all these are unmistakable symptoms of the secret doubts hidden beneath Henry's consciousness.
Henry's psychic condition was most impressively depicted in the following dream, which exposed his fear of primitive sensuality and his desire to escape into a kind of asceticism. In it one can see the direction his development was taking. For this reason the dream will be interpreted at greater length.
I find myself on a narrow mountain road. O n the left (going down) there is a deep abyss, on the right a wall of rock. Along the road there are several caves, shelters, cut out of the rock, as protection from the weather for lonely wanderers. In one of these caves, half hidden, a prostitute has taken refuge. Strangely, I see her from behind, from the rock side. She has a formless, spongy body. I look at her with curiosity and touch her buttocks. Perhaps, it suddenly seems to me, she is not a woman but a kind of male prostitute. This same creature comes then to the fore as a saint with a short crimson coat thrown around his shoulders. He strides down the road and goes into another, much larger cave fitted with roughhewn chairs and benches. With a haughty look he drives out all those already present, also me. Then he and his followers move in and establish themselves.
The personal association that Henry contributed to the prostitute was the "Venus of Will e n d o r f , " a little c a r v e d figure (from t h e p a l e o
284



litliic age) of a fleshy woman, probably a nature or fertility goddess. Then he added : " I first h e a r d t h a t t o u c h i n g the b u t t o c k s is a fertility rite when I was on a tour through the Wallis [a canton in French Switzerland ], where I visited ancient Celtic graves and excavations. There I was told that there was once a smooth sloping surface of tiles smeared with all kinds of substances. Infertile women had to slide down on their bare buttocks in order to cure their sterility." T o the coat of the "saint," Henry associated t h i s : " M y fiancee o w n s a j a c k e t of similar shape, but it's white. O n the evening before the dream we were out dancing, and she was wearing this white jacket. Another girl, who is h e r friend, was with us. S h e h a d a crimson jacket that I liked better." If dreams are not wish-fulfillments (as Freud taught) but rather, as J u n g assumed, "self-representations of the unconscious," then we must admit that Henry's psychic condition could hardly be better represented than in the description given in the "saint" dream. H e n r y is a "lonely w a n d e r e r " on the n a r r o w p a t h . But ( p e r h a p s t h a n k s to analysis)" he is already on his way down from inhospitable heights. T o the left, on the side of the unconscious, his r o a d is b o r d e r e d by the terrifying
depths of an abyss. O n the right side, the side of consciousness, the w a y is blocked by the rigid rock wall of his conscious views. However, in the caves (which might represent, so to speak, u n c o n s c i o u s a r e a s in H e n r y ' s field of consciousness) there are places where refuge can be found when bad weather comes in other words, when outside tensions become too threatening. T h e caves are the result of purposeful human work: cut into the rock. In a way they resemble the gaps that occur in our consciousness when our power of concentration has reached its limits a n d is broken, so that the stuff of fantasy can penetrate without restraint. At such times something unexpected can reveal itself and allow a deep insight into the background of the psyche a glimpse into the unconscious regions where our imagination has free play. Moreover, rock caves may be symbols of the w o m b of Mother Earth, appearing as mysterious caverns in which transformation and rebirth can come about.
Thus the dream seems to represent Henry's introverted withdrawal —when the world becomes too difficult for him - into a " c a v e " within his consciousness where he can succumb to subjective fantasies. This interpretation would also e x p l a i n w h y he seeks t h e female figure

a replica of some of the inner feminine traits of his psyche. She is a formless, spongy, halfhidden prostitute representing the repressed image in his unconscious of a woman whom Henry would never have approached in conscious life. She would always have been strictly taboo to him in spite of the fact that (as the opposite of a too-much-venerated mother) the prostitute would have a secret fascination for him —as for every son with a m o t h e r - c o m p l e x . T h e idea of restricting a relationship with a woman to a purely animal-like sensuality, excluding all feelings, is often enticing to such a young man. In such a union he can keep his feelings split off, a n d t h u s c a n r e m a i n " t r u e " to his mother in an ultimate sense. Thus, in spite of everything, the taboo set by the mother against every other woman remains inflexibly effective in the psyche of the son. Henry, who seems to have withdrawn totally to the background of his fantasy-cave, sees the prostitute only "from behind." He dares not look her in the face. But "from the back" also means from her least human side her buttocks
(i.e. the part of her body that will stimulate the sensual activity of the male). By touching the buttocks of the prostitute, H e n r y unconsciously carries out a kind of fertility rite, similar to the rites that are practiced in many primitive tribes. T h e laying on of hands and healing often go together; in the same way, touching with the hand can be either a defense or a curse. I m m e d i a t e l y the idea arises t h a t the figure is not a woman after all but a male prostitute. T h e figure thus b e c o m e s h e r m a p h r o d i t i c , like m a n y m y t h o l o g i c a l figures ( a n d like the " p r i e s t " figure of the first d r e a m ) . I n s e c u r i t y c o n c e r n i n g his own sex can often be observed in a pubescent individual; and for this reason homosexuality in adolescence is not considered unusual. N o r is such u n c e r t a i n t y e x c e p t i o n a l for a y o u n g man with Henry's psychological structure; he had already implied this in some of his earlier dreams.
But repression (as well as sexual uncertainty) may have caused the confusion about the sex of the p r o s t i t u t e . T h e female figure t h a t has
A coat can often symbolize the outer m a s k or persona t h a t o n e p r e s e n t s t o the world. The mantle of the prophet Elijah bore a similar meaning: When he ascended to heaven (left, in a Swedish peasant painting), he left the mantle behind for his successor Elisha Thus the mantle represented the prophet's power and role, to be assumed by his successor (In the p a i n t i n g the mantle is red, like the saint'scoat in Henry's dream.)



both a t t r a c t e d a n d repelled the d r e a m e r is t r a n s f o r m e d first of all into a m a n a n d t h e n into a saint. The second transformation eliminates everything sexual from the image, and implies that the only means of escape from the reality of sex lies in the adoption of an ascetic and holy life, denying the flesh. Such d r a m a t i c reversals are common in dreams: Something turns into its opposite (as the prostitute becomes a saint) as if to d e m o n s t r a t e that by t r a n s m u t a tion even extreme opposites can change into each other. Henry also saw something significant in the saint's coat. A coat is often a symbol of the protective cover or mask (which Jung called the persona) that a n i n d i v i d u a l presents to the world. It has two p u r p o s e s : first, to m a k e a specific impression on other people: second, to conceal the individual's inner self from their p r y i n g eyes. T h e persona t h a t H e n r y ' s d r e a m gives the saint tells us something about his attit u d e to his fiancee a n d her friend. T h e saint's coat has the color of the friend's jacket, which H e n r y had a d m i r e d , but it also had the shape of his fiancee's coat. T h i s m a y i m p l y that Henry's unconscious wanted to confer the quality of saintliness on both women, in order to protect himself against their womanly attractiveness. Also, the coat is red, w h i c h (as has been noted before) is t r a d i t i o n a l l y the symbolic color of feeling and passion. It thus gives the saint figure a kind of eroticized spirituality — a
q u a l i t y t h a t is frequently found in m e n w h o repress their own sexuality and try to rely solely on their "spirit" or reason. Such an escape from the world of the flesh, h o w e v e r , is u n n a t u r a l in a y o u n g person. In the first half of life, we should l e a r n to accept o u r sexuality : It is essential to the preservation and continuation of our species. T h e dream seems to be reminding Henry of just this point. When the saint leaves the cave and walks down the road (descending from the heights toward the valley), he enters a second cave with rough-hewn benches and chairs, which reminds one of the early Christians' places of worship and refuge from persecution. This cave seems to be a healing, holy place a place of meditation and of the mystery of transformation from the earthly to the heavenly, from the carnal to the spiritual.
H e n r y is not p e r m i t t e d to follow the saint, b u t is t u r n e d out of the cave with all those present (that is, with his unconscious entities). Seemingly. Henry and all the others who are not followers of the saint are being told that they must live in the outside world. T h e dream seems to say t h a t H e n r y must first succeed in o u t e r life before he will be able to i m m e r s e himself in a religious or spiritual s p h e r e . T h e figure of the saint also seems to symbolize (in a relatively undifferentiated, anticipatory fashion) the Self; b u t H e n r y is not yet m a t u r e e n o u g h to stay in the i m m e d i a t e vicinity of this figure.
Henry's touching the prostitute can be related to the belief in the magical effect of a touch: Left, the 17th century Irishman Valentine Greatrakes, famous for healing by laying on of hands
Right, another example of the persona T h e c l o t h i n g w o r n b y rebellious British "beatnik" youths in the 1960s indicated the values and w a y of life that they wanted to display to the outer world.



How the analysis developed
In spite of an initial skepticism and resistance, Henry began to take a lively interest in the inner happenings of his psyche. He was obviously impressed by his dreams. They seemed to compensate for his unconscious life in a m e a n ingful way and to give him valuable insights into his ambivalence, his vacillation, and his preference for passivity. After a time more positive dreams appeared that showed that Henry was already "well on his way." T w o months after his analysis had begun he reported this dream:
In the harbor of a little place not far from my home, on the shore of a lake in the neighborhood, locomotives and freight cars are being raised from the bottom of the lake where they had been sunk in the last war. First a large cylinder like a locomotive boiler is brought up. Then an enormous, rusty freight car. The whole picture pre
sents a horrible yet romantic sight. The recovered pieces have to be transported away under the rails and cables of the nearby railway station. Then the bottom of the lake changes into a green meadow.
Here we see what a remarkable inner advance Henry has made. Locomotives (probably symbols of energy and dynamism) have been "sunk" —i.e. repressed into the unconsciousbut are now being brought into the light of day. With them are freight cars, in which all kinds of valuable cargo (psychic qualities) can be transported. Now that these "objects" have again become available for Henry's conscious life, he can begin to realize how much active power could be at his disposal. T h e transformation of the dark lake bottom into a meadow underlines his potential for positive action.
Sometimes, on Henry's "lonely journey" toward maturity, he also received help from his



feminine side. In his 24th dream he meets a "humpbacked girl":
I am on the way to a school together with an unknown young lady of small and daintv appearance but disfigured by a hump. Many other people also go into the schoolhouse. While the others disperse to different rooms for singing lessons, the girl and I sit at a little square table. She gives me a private singing lesson. I feel an impulse of pity for her and therefore kiss her on the mouth. I am conscious, however, that by this act I am unfaithful to my fiancee- even though it may be excusable.
Singing is o n e of the i m m e d i a t e expressions of feelings. But (as we have seen) H e n r y is afraid of his feelings; he knows them only in an idealized adolescent form. Nevertheless, in this d r e a m he is t a u g h t singing (the expression of feelings) at a square table. T h e table, with its four equal sides, is a r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of the "fourfoldness" motif, usually a symbol of completeness. Thus the relation between singing
As in the painting, left (by the 19th century British artist William T u r n e r ) , e n t i t l e d Rain, Steam, and Speed, t h e l o c o m o t i v e is clearly a n image of driving, dynamic energy In H e n r y ' s d r e a m ( w h i c h h e d r e w , b e l o w ) , locomotives are raised out of a lake — an expression of the release of a potential for valuable action that had previously been repressed into his unconscious
and the square table seems to indicate that Henry must integrate his "feeling" side before he can achieve psychic wholeness. In fact, the singing lesson does move his feelings, and he kisses the girl on her mouth. T h e r e b y he has, in a sense, "espoused" her (otherwise he would not feel " u n f a i t h f u l " ) ; he has learned to relate to "the woman within." Another dream demonstrates the part that this little humpbacked girl had to play in Henry's inner development:
I am in an unknown boys" school. During the instruction period I secretly force my way into the house. I don't know for what purpose. I hide in the room behind a little square closet. The door to the corridor is half open. I fear being detected. An adult goes by without seeing me. But a little humpbacked girl comes in and sees me at once. She pulls me out of my hiding place.
Not only does the same girl appear in both dreams, but both appearances take place in a schoolhouse. In each instance Henry must learn something to assist his development. Seemingly, he would like to satisfy his desire for knowledge while remaining unnoticed and passive. The figure of a deformed little girl appears in numerous fairy tales. In such tales the ugliness of the h u m p usually conceals great beauty, which is revealed w h e n the " r i g h t m a n " comes to free the girl from a magic spell —often by a kiss. T h e girl in Henry's d r e a m may be a symbol of Henry's soul, which also has to be released from the "spell" that has m a d e it ugly. When the humpbacked girl tries to awaken Henry's feelings by song, or pulls him out of his dark hiding place (forcing him to confront the light of dayi, she shows herself as a helpful guide. Henry can and must in a sense belong s i m u l t a n e o u s l y to b o t h his fiancee a n d the little h u m p b a c k e d girl (to the first as a r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of the real, outer woman, and to the second as the embodiment of the inner psychic anima).

The oracle dream
People who rely totally on their rational thinking and dismiss or repress every manifestation of their psychic life often have a n almost inexplicable inclination to superstition. They listen to oracles and prophecies and can be easily hoodwinked or influenced by magicians and conjurers. And because dreams compensate one's outer life, the emphasis such people put on their intellect is offset by d r e a m s in which they meet the irrational and cannot escape it. Henry experienced this phenomenon in the course of his analysis, in an impressive way. Four extraordinary dreams, based on such irrational themes, represented decisive milestones in his s p i r i t u a l d e v e l o p m e n t . T h e first of these c a m e a b o u t 10 weeks after the analysis began. As Henry reported the d r e a m :
Alone on an adventurous journey through South America, I feel, at last, the desire to return home. In a foreign city situated on a mountain I try to reach the railway station, which I instinctively suspect to be in the center of the town at its highest level. I fear I may be too late. Fortunately, however, a vaulted passage breaks through the row of houses on my right, built closely together as in the architecture of the Middle Ages, forming an impenetrable wall behind which the station is probably to be found. The whole scene offers a very picturesque aspect. I see the sunny, painted facades of the houses, the dark archway in whose shadowy obscurity four ragged figures have settled down on the pavement. With a sigh of relief, I hurry toward the passage—when suddenly a stranger, a trappertype, appears ahead of me evidently filled with the same desire to catch the train. At our approach the four gatekeepers, who turn out to be Chinese, jump up to prevent our passage. In the ensuing fight my left leg is injured by the long nails on the left foot of one of the Chinese. An oracle has to decide now whether the way could be opened to us or whether our lives must be forfeited. I am the first to be dealt with. While my companion is bound and led inside, the Chinese con
sult the oracle by using little ivory sticks. The judgment goes against me, but I am given another chance. I am fettered and led aside, just as my companion was, and he now takes my place. In his presence, the oracle has to decide my fate for the second time. O n this occasion it is in my favor. I am saved.
One immediately notices the singularity and the exceptional meaning of the dream, its wealth of symbols, and its compactness. However, it seemed as if Henry's conscious mind wanted to ignore the dream. Because of his skepticism t o w a r d the p r o d u c t s of his unconscious it was important not to expose the dream to the danger of rationalization, but rather to let it act on him without interference. So I refrained a t first from m y i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . I n s t e a d I offered only one suggestion: I advised him to read and then to consult (as did .the Chinese figures in his d r e a m ) the famous C h i n e s e oracle book, t h e / Ching.
T h e / Ching, the so-called " B o o k of C h a n g e s , " is a very a n c i e n t book of w i s d o m ; its roots go back to mythical times, and it comes to us in its present form from 3000 B.C. According to Richard Wilhelm (who translated it into German and provided an admirable commentary), both of the main branches of Chinese philosophy—Taoism and Confucianism—have t h e i r c o m m o n origin in t h e / Ching. T h e book is b a s e d o n the hypothesis of t h e oneness of m a n and the surrounding cosmos, and of the complementary pairs of opposites Yang and Yin (i.e. the male and female principles). It consists of 64 "signs" each represented by a drawing m a d e up of six lines. In these signs are contained all the possible combinations of Yang and Yin. T h e straight lines are looked upon as male, the broken lines as female.
Each sign describes changes in the human or cosmic situation, and each prescribes, in a
290



pictorial language, the course of action to be followed at such times. The Chinese consulted this oracle by means that indicated which of the signs was relevant at a given moment. They did so by using 50 small sticks in a rather complicated way that yielded a given number. (Incidentally, Henry said that he had once read — probably in Jung's commentary on " T h e Secret of the Golden Flower"—of a strange game sometimes used by the Chinese to find out about the future.) Today the more usual method of consulting the / Ching is to use t h r e e coins. E a c h t h r o w of the three coins yields one line. " H e a d s , " which stands for a male line, count as three; "tails," a broken female line, count as two. T h e coins are thrown six times, and the n u m bers that are produced indicate the sign or hexagram (i.e. the set of six lines) to be consulted. But what significance has such "fortune telling" for our own time? Even those who accept the idea t h a t the / Ching is a storehouse of w i s d o m will find it h a r d to believe t h a t c o n sultation of the oracle is a n y t h i n g m o r e t h a n a n e x p e r i m e n t in t h e occult. It is i n d e e d diffi
cult to grasp that m o r e is involved, for the ordinary person today consciously dismisses all divining techniques as archaic nonsense. Yet they are not nonsense. As Dr. J u n g has shown, they are based on what he calls the "principle of synchronicity" for, more simply, meaningful coincidence). He has described this difficult new idea in his essay "Synchronicity: An Acausal C o n n e c t i n g P r i n c i p l e . " It is based on the assumption of an inner unconscious knowledge that links a physical event with a psychic condition, so that a certain event that appears "accidental" or "coincidental" can in fact be psychically m e a n i n g f u l ; a n d its m e a n i n g is often symbolically indicated through dreams that coincide with the event.
Several weeks after having studied the / Ching, H e n r y followed my suggestion (with considerable skepticism) and threw the coins. What he found in the book had a tremendous impact on him. Briefly, the oracle to which he referred bore several startling references to his dream, and to his psychological condition generally. By a r e m a r k a b l e "synchronistic" coincidence, the sign that was indicated by the coinpattern was called M E N G - or "Youthful Folly."
Left, t w o p a g e s o f t h e / Ching showing the hexagram M E N G (which stands for "youthful folly"). The top three lines of the hexagram symbolize a mountain, and can also represent a gate; the bottom three lines symbolize water and the abyss.
Right, Henry's drawing of the sword and helmet that appeared to him in a fantasy, and that also related to a s e c t i o n of t h e / Ching — Li, " t h e clinging, fire."



In this chapter there are several parallels to the dream motifs in question. According to the text of the / Ching, the t h r e e u p p e r lines of this hexagram symbolize a mountain, and have the meaning of ''keeping still"; they can also be interpreted as a gate. T h e three lower lines symbolize water, the abyss, and the moon. All these symbols have occurred in Henry's previous dreams. Among many other statements that seemed to apply to Henry was the following w a r n i n g : " F o r youthful folly, it is the most hopeless thing to entangle itself in empty imaginings. T h e more obstinately it clings to such unreal fantasies the more certainly will humiliation overtake it."
In this and other complex ways, the oracle seemed to be directly relevant to Henry's prob l e m . T h i s shook h i m . At first he tried to suppress its effect by willpower, but he could not escape it or his d r e a m s . T h e message of the / Clung seemed to t o u c h h i m d e e p l y in spite of the puzzling language in which it was expressed. He became overpowered by the very irrationality whose existence he had so long denied. Sometimes silent, sometimes irritated, reading the words that seemed to coincide so strongly with the symbols in his dreams, he said, "I must think all this over t h o r o u g h l y , " a n d he left before our session was up. He canceled his next session by telephone, because of influenza, and did not reappear. I waited '"keeping still") because I supposed that he might not yet have digested the oracle.
A month went by. Finally Henry reappeared, excited and disconcerted, and told me what had happened in the meantime. Initially his intellect (which he h a d until then relied u p o n so much) had suffered a great shock — and one t h a t he h a d at first tried to suppress. H o w e v e r , he soon had to admit that the communications of the oracle were pursuing him. He had intended to consult the book again, because in his dream the oracle had been consulted twice. But the text of the chapter "Youthful Folly" expressly forbids the putting of a second question. For two nights Henry had tossed sleeplessly in bed; but on the third a luminous dream image of great power had suddenly
appeared before his eyes: a helmet with a sword floating in e m p t y space. H e n r y i m m e d i a t e l y took u p the / Ching again and opened it at r a n d o m to a commentary on Chapter 30, where (to his great surprise) he read the following passage: "The clinging is fire, it m e a n s coats of mail, h e l m e t s , it means lances and w e a p o n s . " Now he felt that he understood why a second intentional consulting of the oracle was forbidden. For in his dream the ego was excluded from the second question; it was the trapper who had to consult the oracle the second time. In the same way, it was Henry's semi-unconscious action that had unintentionally asked the second q u e s t i o n of t h e / Ching by o p e n i n g the book at random and coming upon a symbol that coincided with his nocturnal vision.
H e n r y was clearly so deeply stirred that it seemed time to try to interpret the dream that had sparked the transformation. In view of the events of the dream, it was obvious that the dream-elements should be interpreted as contents of Henry's inner personality and the six dream-figures as personification of his psychic qualities. Such dreams are relatively rare, but when they do occur their after-effects are all the m o r e powerful. T h a t is w h y they could be called "dreams of transformation." With dreams of such pictorial power, the d r e a m e r seldom has more than a few personal associations. All Henry could offer was that he had recently tried for a j o b in Chile, and had been refused because they would not employ unmarried men. He also knew that some Chinese let the nails of their left h a n d grow as a sign that instead of working they have given themselves over to meditation. Henry's failure (to get a job in South America! was presented to him in the dream. In it he is t r a n s p o r t e d into a hot s o u t h e r n

world — a world that, in contrast to Europe, he would call primitive, uninhibited, and sensual. It represents an excellent symbolic picture of the realm of the unconscious. This realm was the opposite of the cultivated intellect and Swiss puritanism that ruled Henry's conscious mind. It was, in fact, his natural "shadow l a n d , " for which he had longed; but after a while he did not seem to feel too comfortable there. From the chthonic. dark, maternal powers (symbolized by South America) he is d r a w n b a c k in the d r e a m to the light, personal m o t h e r a n d to his fiancee. H e suddenly realizes how far he has gone away from t h e m ; he finds himself a l o n e in a "foreign c i t y . " T h i s increase in consciousness is symbolized in the d r e a m as a "higher level"; the city was built on a mountain. So Henry "climbed u p " to a greater consciousness in the "shadow l a n d " ; from there he hoped "to find his way home." This problem of ascending a mountain had already been put to him in his initial
dream. And, as in the dream of the saint and the prostitute, or in many mythological tales, a m o u n t a i n often symbolizes a p l a c e of revelation, where transformation and change may take place. T h e " c i t y on the m o u n t a i n " is also a wellknown archetypal symbol that appears in the history of o u r c u l t u r e in m a n y v a r i a t i o n s . T h e city, corresponding in its ground plan to a mandala, represents that "region of the soul" in the middle of which the Self (the psyche's innermost center and totality) has its abode. Surprisingly, the seat of the Self is r e p r e sented in Henry's dream as a traffic center of the human collective — a railway station. This m a y be because the Self (if the d r e a m e r is young and has a relatively low level of spiritual d e v e l o p m e n t ) is usually symbolized by a n object from the realm of his personal experience often a banal object, which compensates the dreamer's high aspirations. Only in the mature person acquainted with the images of his soul is the Self realized in a symbol t h a t corresponds to its unique value. Even though Henry does not actually know where the station is, he nevertheless supposes it to be in the center of the city, on its highest point. Here, as in earlier dreams, he receives help from his unconscious. Henry's conscious mind was identified with his profession as an engineer, so he would also like his inner world to relate to rational products of civilization, like a railway station. The dream, however, rejects this a t t i t u d e a n d indicates a completely different way.
The way leads "under" and through a dark a r c h . A n a r c h e d g a t e w a y is also a symbol for a threshold, a place where dangers lurk, a place that at the same time separates and unites. Instead of the railway station that Henry was looking for, which was to connect uncivilized S o u t h A m e r i c a w i t h E u r o p e , H e n r y finds h i m self before a dark arched gateway where four ragged Chinese, stretched on the ground, block the passage. The dream makes no distinction between them, so they may be seen as four still undifferentiated aspects of a male totality. (The number (bur, a symbol of wholeness and com
293



pleteness, represents an archetype that Dr. Jung has discussed at length in his writings.) The Chinese thus represent unconscious male psychic parts of Henry that he cannot pass, because the "way to the Self" (i.e. to the psychic center) is b a r r e d by t h e m a n d m u s t still be opened to him. Until this issue has been settled he cannot continue his journey. Still unaware of the impending danger, Henry hurries to the gateway, expecting at last to reach the station. But on his way he meets his " s h a d o w " — his unlived, primitive side, which appears in the guise of an earthy, rough t r a p p e r . T h e a p p e a r a n c e of this figure p r o b a b l y means that Henry's introverted ego has been joined by his extraverted (compensatory) side, which represents his repressed emotional and i r r a t i o n a l traits. T h i s s h a d o w figure pushes itself past the conscious ego into the foreground, and, because it personifies the activity and autonomy of unconscious qualities, it becomes the proper carrier of fate, through whom everything happens.
T h e dream moves toward its climax. During the fight b e t w e e n H e n r y , t h e t r a p p e r , a n d t h e four ragged Chinese, H e n r y ' s left leg is scratched by the long nails on the left foot of one of the four. (Here, it seems, the European character of Henry's conscious ego has collided with a personification of the ancient wisdom of the East, with the extreme opposite of his ego. The Chinese come from an entirely different psychic c o n t i n e n t , from a n " o t h e r s i d e " t h a t is
still quite unknown to Henry and that seems dangerous to him.) T h e Chinese can also be said to stand for the "yellow e a r t h " ; for the Chinese people are related to the earth as few people are. A n d it is just this earthy, chthonic quality that H e n r y had to accept. The unconscious male totality of his psyche, which he met in his dream, had a chthonic material aspect that his intellectual conscious side lacked. Thus the fact that he r e c o g n i z e d t h e four r a g g e d figures as Chinese shows that Henry had gained an increase of inner awareness concerning the nature of his adversaries. Henry had heard that the Chinese sometimes let the nails of their left h a n d grow long. But in the d r e a m the long nails are on the left foot; they are, so to speak, claws. This may indicate t h a t the C h i n e s e h a v e a p o i n t of view so different from Henry's that it injures him. As we
Below, a drawing by a patient under analysis depicts a black monster (on the red or "feeling" side) and a Madonna-like woman (on the blue or spiritual side). This was Henry's position: over-emphasis on purity, chastity, etc. and fear of the irrational unconscious. (But note that the green, mandala-like flower acts as a link between the opposing sides.) Below left, another patient's painting depicting his i n s o m n i a caused by his repressing too strongly his passionate, red, instinctual drives (which may overwhelm his consciousness) by a black " w a l l " of anxiety and depression.



know, Henry's conscious attitude toward the chthonic and feminine, toward the material depths of his nature, was most uncertain and ambivalent. This attitude, symbolized by his "left leg" (the point of view or "standpoint" of his feminine, unconscious side of w h i c h he is still afraid), was harmed by the Chinese. This "injury," however, did not itself bring about a change in Henry. Every transformation demands as its precondition "the ending of a world" — the collapse of an old philosophy of life. As Dr. Henderson has pointed out earlier in this book, at ceremonies of initiation a youth must suffer a symbolic death before he can be reborn as a m a n and be taken into the tribe as a full m e m b e r . T h u s the scientific, logical attitude of the engineer must collapse to make room for a new attitude.
In the psyche of an engineer, everything "irrational" may be repressed, and therefore often reveals itself in the dramatic paradoxes of the dream-world. Thus the irrational appeared in Henry's dream as an "oracle g a m e " of foreign origin, with a fearful and inexplicable power to decide h u m a n destinies. Henry's ratirnal ego had no alternative but to surrender u n c o n d i t i o n a l l y in a real sacrificium intellectus. Yet the conscious mind of such an inexperienced, i m m a t u r e person as H e n r y is not sufficiently prepared for such an act. H e loses the t u r n of fortune, a n d his life is forfeit. H e is caught, unable to go on in his accustomed way or to return home — to escape his adult responsibilities. (It was this insight for which Henry had to be prepared by this "great dream.") Next, H e n r y ' s conscious, civilized ego is bound and put aside while the primitive trapp e r is allowed to take his p l a c e a n d to consult the oracle. H e n r y ' s life d e p e n d s on the result. But w h e n the ego is imprisoned in isolation, those contents of the unconscious that are personified in the shadow-figure may bring help and solution. This becomes possible when one recognizes the existence of such contents and has experienced their power. They can then become our consciously accepted constant companions. Because the trapper (his shadow) wins the g a m e in his place, H e n r y is saved.
Facing the irrational
Henry's subsequent behavior clearly showed that the dream (and the fact that his dreams a n d t h e o r a c l e b o o k of the / Ching h a d b r o u g h t him to face deep and irrational powers within himself) had a very deep effect on him. From then on he listened eagerly to the communications of his unconscious, and the analysis took on a more and more agitated character. The tension that until then had threatened the depths of his psyche with disruption came to the surface. Nevertheless, he courageously held to the growing hope that a satisfactory conclusion would be reached.
Barely two weeks after the oracle dream (but before it was discussed and interpreted), Henry had another dream in which he was once again confronted with the disturbing problem of the irrational:
Alone in my room. A lot of disgusting black beetles crawl out of a hole and spread out over my drawing table. I try to drive them back into their hole by means of some sort of magic. I am successful in this except for four or five beetles, which leave my table again and spread out into the whole room. I give up the idea of following them further; they are no longer so disgusting to me. I set fire to the hiding place. A tall column of flame rises up. I fear my room might catch fire, but this fear is unfounded.
By this time, H e n r y had become relatively skilful in the interpretation of his dreams, so he tried to give this dream an explanation of his own. He said : "The beetles are my dark qualities. They were awakened by the analysis and come u p now to the surface. T h e r e is a d a n g e r that they may overflow my professional work (symbolized by the drawing table). Yet I did not dare to crush the beetles, which reminded me of a kind of black scarab, with my hand as I first i n t e n d e d , a n d therefore h a d to use ' m a g i c ' I n setting fire to their h i d i n g p l a c e I,
295



so to speak, call for the collaboration of somet h i n g divine, as the u p s h o o t i n g c o l u m n of flame makes m e think of the fire t h a t I associate with the Ark of the Covenant." T o go deeper into the symbolism of the d r e a m , we must first of all note that these beetles a r e black, w h i c h is the color of d a r k n e s s , depression, a n d d e a t h . In the d r e a m , H e n r y is " a l o n e " in his room a situation that can lead to introversion and corresponding states of gloom. In mythology, scarab beetles often appear golden; in Egypt they were sacred a n i m a l s s y m b o l i z i n g the sun. But if they a r c black, they symbolize the opposite side of the sun something devilish. Therefore. Henry's instinct is q u i t e correct in w a n t i n g to fight the beetles with magic.
T h o u g h lour or five of the beetles remain alive, the d e c r e a s e in the n u m b e r of beetles is enough to free Henry from his fear and disgust. He then tries to destroy their breeding ground by fire. T h i s is a positive a c t i o n , because fire can symbolically lead to transformation and rebirth (as, for instance, it does in the ancient myth of the phoenix). In his waking life, H e n r y now seemed full of enterprising spirit, but apparently he had not yet learned to use it to the right effect. T h e r e fore, I want to consider another, later dream that throws an even clearer light on his problem. This dream presents in symbolic language H e n r y s fear of a responsible relationship with a woman and his tendency to withdraw from the feeling side of life:
A b o v e , an E g y p t i a n relief (c 1 3 0 0 B.C.) s h o w s a scarab beetle a n d the god A m o n within the circle of the sun. In Egypt the golden scarab was itself a symbol of the sun. Below, a guite different kind of insect, more like the "devilish" beetles of Henry's dream: an engraving by the 19th-century artist James Ensor of humans with dark, repulsive insect bodies.
An old man is breathing his last. He is surrounded by his relatives, and I am among them. More and more people gather in the large room, each one characterizing himself through precise statements. There are a good 40 persons present. The old man groans and mutters about "unlived life." His daughter, who wants to make his confession easier, asks him in what sense "unlived" is to be understood; whether cultural or moral. I he old man will not answer. His daughter sends me to a small adjoining room where I am to find the answer by telling a fortune with cards. The "nine" that I turn up will give the answer, according to the color.
296



I expect to turn up a nine at the very beginning, but at first I turn up various kings and queens. I am disappointed. Now I turn up nothing but scraps of paper that don't belong to the game at all. Finally, I discover that there are no more cards in the deck but only envelopes and other pieces of paper. Together with my sister, who is also present, I look everywhere for the cards. Finally I discover one under a textbook or a notebook. It is nine, a nine of spades. It seems to me that this can only mean one thing: that it was moral chains that prevented the old man from "living his life."
T h e essential message of this strange dream was to warn H e n r y w h a t awaited him if he failed to "live his life." I h e "old m a n " probably represents the dying "ruling principle"the principle that rules Henry's consciousness, but whose n a t u r e is u n k n o w n to him. T h e 40 people present symbolize the totality of Henry's psychic traits (40 is a n u m b e r of totality, a n elevated form of the n u m b e r four). T h a t the old m a n is d y i n g could be a sign t h a t p a r t of H e n r y ' s m a l e personality is on the verge of a final t r a n s f o r m a t i o n .
The daughter's query about the possible cause of death is the unavoidable and decisive question. There seems to be an implication that the old man's "morality" has prevented him from living out his natural feelings and drives. Yet the d y i n g m a n himself is silent. T h e r e f o r e his daughter (the personification of the mediating feminine principle, the anima) has to become active. She sends Henry to discover the answer from the fortune-telling cards — the answer that will be given by the color of the first n i n e t u r n e d u p . The fortune telling has to take place in an unused, remote room (revealing how far away such a h a p p e n i n g is from H e n r y ' s conscious attitude). H e is d i s a p p o i n t e d w h e n at first h e u n c o v e r s only kings and queens (perhaps collective images of his youthful veneration for power and wealth]. This disappointment becomes intense when the picture-cards run out, for this shows that the symbols of the inner world have also been exhausted. Only "scraps of paper"
are left, without any images. T h u s the source of pictures dries up in the dream. Henry then has to accept the help of his feminine side (this t i m e r e p r e s e n t e d by his sister) to find t h e last c a r d . T o g e t h e r w i t h her, he finally finds a c a r d — the nine of spades. It is this card that must serve to indicate by its color what the phrase " u n l i v e d life" m e a n t in the d r e a m . A n d it is significant that the card is h i d d e n u n d e r a textbook or notebook- which probably represents the arid intellectual formulas of Henry's technical interests.
T h e nine has been a "magic n u m b e r " for centuries. According to the traditional symbolism of numbers, it represents the perfect form of the perfected Trinity in its threefold elevation. And there are endless other meanings associated with the number nine in various ages a n d c u l t u r e s . T h e color of the n i n e of spades is t h e color of d e a t h a n d of lifelessness. Also, the " s p a d e " image strongly brings to mind the form of a leaf, a n d therefore its blackness emphasizes that instead of being green, vital, and natural it is n o w d e a d . F u r t h e r m o r e , the w o r d " s p a d e " derives from the I t a l i a n spada, w h i c h m e a n s "sword" or "spear." Such weapons often symbolize the penetrating, "cutting" function of the intellect.
T h u s the dream makes it clear that it was the "moral bonds" (rather than "cultural") that did not allow the old man to "live his life." In Henry's case, these " b o n d s " probably were his fear of s u r r e n d e r i n g fully to life, of a c c e p t i n g responsibilities to a woman and thereby becoming "unfaithful" to his mother. T h e dream has d e c l a r e d that the " u n l i v e d life" is an illness of which one can die. Henry could no longer disregard the message of this dream. He realized that one needs something more than reason as a helpful compass in the entanglements of life; it is necessary to seek the guidance of the unconscious powers that emerge as symbols out of the depths of the psyche. With this recognition, the goal of this part of his analysis was reached. He now knew t h a t he was finally expelled from the p a r a d i s e of an u n c o m m i t t e d life a n d that he could never return to it.

The final dream
A further dream came to confirm irrevocably the insights Henry had gained. After some unimportant short dreams that concerned his everyday life, the last d r e a m (the 50th in the series) appeared with all the wealth of symbols that characterizes the so-called "great dreams."
Four of us form a friendly group, and we have the following experiences: Evening: We are sitting at a long, raw-lumber table and drinking out of each of three different vessels: from a liqueur glass, a clear, yellow, sweet liqueur; from a wine glass, dark red Campari; from a large, classically shaped vessel, tea. In addition to us there is also a girl of reserved, delicate nature. She pours her liqueur into the tea. Night: We have returned from a big drinking bout. One of us is the President de la Republique Franchise. We are in his palace. Walking out onto the balcony we perceive him beneath us in the snowy street as he, in his drunken condition, urinates against a mound of snow. His bladder content seems to be inexhaustible. Now he even runs after an old spinster who carries in her arms a child wrapped in a brown blanket. He sprays the child with his urine. T h e spinster feels the moisture but ascribes it to the child. She hurries away with long steps. Morning: Through the street, which glistens in the winter sun, goes a Negro: a gorgeous figure, completely naked. He walks toward the east, toward Berne (that is, the Swiss capital). We are in French Switzerland. We decide to go to pay him a visit. Noon: After a long automobile trip through a lonely snowy region we come to a city, and into a dark house where the Negro is said to have put up. We are very much afraid that he might be frozen to death. However, his servant, who is just as dark, receives us. Negro and servant are mute. We look into the rusksacks we have brought with us, to see what each could give the Negro as a gift. It must be some sort of object characteristic of civilization. I am the first to make up my mind and I take a package of matches from the floor and offer it to the Negro with deference. After all have presented their gifts, we join with the Negro in a happy feast, a joyous revel.



Even at first glance the dream with its four parts makes an unusual impression. It encompasses a whole day and moves toward the "right," in the direction of growing consciousness. The movement starts with the evening, goes over into the night, and ends at noon, w h e n the sun is at its zenith. T h u s the cycle of the " d a y " appears as a totality pattern. In this dream the four friends seem to symbolize the unfolding masculinity of Henry's psyche, and their progress through the four "acts" of the dream has a geometric pattern that reminds one of the essential construction of t h e m a n d a l a . As t h e y first c a m e from t h e east, then from the west, moving on toward the " c a p i t a l " of Switzerland (i.e. the center), they seem to describe a pattern that tries to u n i t e the opposites in a center. A n d this p o i n t is underlined by the movement in time — the descent into the night of the unconsciousness, following the sun's circuit, which is followed by an ascent to the bright zenith of consciousness.
The dream begins in the evening, a time w h e n t h e t h r e s h o l d of consciousness is lowered and the impulses and images of the unconscious can pass across it. In such a condition (when the feminine side of m a n is most easily evoked) it is n a t u r a l to find t h a t a female figure j o i n s t h e four friends. S h e is the a n i m a figure t h a t belongs to them all ("reserved and delicate," reminding Henry of his sister) and connects them all to each other. O n the table stand three vessels of different character, which by their concave form accentuate the receptiveness that is symbolic of the feminine. T h e fact that these vessels are used by all present indicates a mutual and close relatedness among them. The vessels differ in form (liqueur glass, wine glass, and a classically formed container) and in the color of their contents. The opposites into w h i c h these fluids d i v i d e — s w e e t a n d bitter, red and yellow, intoxicating and sobering—are all intermingled, through being consumed by each
of the five persons present, w h o sink into an unconscious communion. The girl seems to be the secret agent, the catalyst w h o precipitates events (for it is the role of the anima to lead a man into his UP. conscious, and thus to force him to deeper recollection a n d increased consciousness). It is almost as though with the mixing of liqueur and tea the party would approach its climax. T h e second part of the dream tells us more of the happenings of this "night." The four friends s u d d e n l y find themselves in Paris (which, for the Swiss, represents the town of sensuality, of uninhibited joy and love). Here a certain differentiation of the four takes place, especially between the ego in the dream (which is to a great extent identified with the leading thinking function) and the "President de la Republique," who represents the undeveloped and unconscious feeling function. The ego (Henry and two friends, who may be considered as representing his semi-conscious functions) looks down from the height of a balcony on the President, whose characteristics a r e exactly w h a t o n e w o u l d expect to find in the undifferentiated side of the psyche. H e is unstable, and has abandoned himself to his instincts. He urinates on the street in a drunken state; he is unconscious of himself, like a person outside civilization, following only his natural animal urges. Thus the President symbolizes a great contrast to the consciously accepted standards of a good middle-class Swiss scientist. Only in the darkest night of the unconscious could this side of H e n r y reveal itself. However, the President-figure also has a very positive aspect. His urine (which could be the symbol of a stream of psychic libido) seems inexhaustible. It gives evidence of abundance, of creative and vital strength. (Primitives, for instance, regard everything coming from the body — hair, excrement, urine, or saliva—as creative, as having magical powers.) This unpleasant
299



Prcsidcnt-imagc, therefore, could also be a sign of the power and plenty that often adheres to the shadow side of the ego. Not only does he urinate without embarrassment, but he runs after a n old w o m a n w h o is h o l d i n g a child. T h i s " o l d s p i n s t e r " is in a w a y the opposite or complement of the shy, fragile anima of the first p a r t of the d r e a m . S h e is still a virgin, even though old and seemingly a mother; in fact, Henry associated her to the archetypal image of Mary with the child Jesus. But the fact that the b a b y is w r a p p e d in a b r o w n ( e a r t h - c o l o r e d ) blanket makes it seem to be the c h t h o n i c , e a r t h bound counter-image of the Savior rather than a heavenly child. The President, who sprinkles the child with his urine, seems to perform a travesty of baptism. If we take the child as a symbol of a p o t e n t i a l i t y within H e n r y t h a t is still infantile, then it could receive strength through this ritual. But the dream says nothing more; the woman hurries away with the child.
This scene marks the turning point of the d r e a m . It is m o r n i n g a g a i n . E v e r y t h i n g that was dark, black, primitive, and powerful in the last episode has been gathered together and symbolized by a magnificent Negro, who appears naked -i.e. real and true. Just as darkness and bright morning—or hot urine and cold snow—are opposites, so now the black man and the white landscape form a sharp antithesis. The four friends now must orient themselves within these new dimensions.
A drinking vessel from ancient Peru, in the shape of a w o m a n , reflects the feminine symbolism of such containers, w h i c h occurs in Henry'sfinal dream.
Their position has c h a n g e d ; the way that led through Paris has brought them unexpectedly i n t o F r e n c h S w i t z e r l a n d ( w h e r e H e n r y ' s fiancee came from). A transformation has taken place in Henry during the earlier phase, when he was overpowered by unconscious contents of his psyche. Now, for the last time, he can begin to find his w a y forward from a p l a c e t h a t was his fiancees h o m e (showing t h a t he a c c e p t s her psychological background). At the beginning he went from eastern Switzerland to Paris (from the east to the west, where the way leads into darkness, the unconsciousness). He has now m a d e a turn of 180", toward the rising sun and the ever-increasing clarity of consciousness. This way points to the middle of Switzerland, to its capital. Berne, and symbolizes Henry's striving toward a center that would unite the opposites within him. T h e N e g r o is for some people the a r c h e t y p a l image of "the dark primal creature" and thus a personification of c e r t a i n c o n t e n t s of,the unconscious. P e r h a p s this is o n e reason why the N e g r o is so often rejected a n d feared by people of the white race. In him the w h i t e m a n sees his living counterpart, his hidden, dark side b r o u g h t before his eyes. (This is just w h a t most people try to avoid; they want to cut it off and repress it.) White men project onto the Negro the primitive drives, the archaic powers, the uncontrolled instincts that they do not want to admit in themselves, of which they are unconscious, and that they therefore designate as the corresponding qualities of other people.
For a young man of Henry's age the Negro may stand on the one h a n d for the sum of all dark traits repressed into unconsciousness; on the other h a n d , he may represent the sum of his primitive, masculine strength and potentialities, his emotional and physical power. That Henry and his friends intend consciously to confront the Negro signifies therefore a decisive step forward on the way to manhood. In the meantime it has become noon, when the sun is at its highest, a n d consciousness has reached its greatest clarity. W e might say that Henrv's ego has continued to become more and more compact, that he has enhanced his capa

city consciously to m a k e decisions. It is still winter, which may indicate a lack of feeling a n d w a r m t h in H e n r y ; his psychic l a n d s c a p e is still wintry and apparently intellectually very cold. The four friends are afraid that the naked Negro (being accustomed to a warm climate) might be frozen. But their fear turns out to be groundless, for after a long drive through deserted snow-covered country they stop in a strange city and enter a dark house. This drive a n d the desolate c o u n t r y is symbolic of the long and wearisome search for self-development.
A further complication awaits the four friends here. The Negro and his servant are m u t e . T h e r e f o r e it is not possible to m a k e verbal contact with them; the four friends must seek other means to get in touch with the Negro. They cannot use intellectual means (words) but rather a feeling gesture to approach him. They offer him a present as one gives an offering to the gods, to win their interest and their affection. And it has to be an object of our civilization, belonging to the values of the intellectual w h i t e m a n . A g a i n a sacrificium intellectus is d e m a n d e d to win the favor of the Negro, who represents nature and instinct.
H e n r y is the first to m a k e u p his m i n d w h a t to do. T h i s is n a t u r a l , since he is the b e a r e r of the ego, whose p r o u d consciousness (or hybris) has to be humbled. He picks up a box of matches from the floor and presents it "with d e f e r e n c e " to the N e g r o . At first g l a n c e it m a y seem absurd that a small object lying on the floor and probably thrown away should be the proper gift, but this was the right choice. M a t c h e s are stored a n d controlled fire, a m e a n s by w h i c h a flame can be lit a n d p u t out at anyt i m e . Fire a n d flame symbolize w a r m t h a n d love, feeling and passion; they are qualities of the heart, found wherever human beings exist.
In giving the Negro such a present, Henry symbolically combines a highly developed civilized product of his conscious ego with the center of his own primitivity and male strength, symbolized by the Negro. In this way, Henry can come into the full possession of his male sides, with which his ego must remain in constant touch from now on.
This was the result. T h e six male persons the four friends, the Negro, and his servant are now together in a gay spirit at a communal meal. It is clear t h a t here H e n r y ' s masculine totality has been rounded out. His ego seems to have found the security it needs to enable him consciously and freely to submit to the greater archetypal personality within himself, which foreshadows the emergence of the Self. W h a t happened in the dream had its parallel also in Henry's waking life. Now he was sure of himself. Deciding quickly, he became serious about his engagement. Exactly nine months after his analysis had begun, he married in a little church of western Switzerland; and he left the following d a y with his young wife for Canada to take up an appointment that he had received during the decisive weeks of his last dreams. Since then he has been living an active, creative life as the head of a little family a n d holds an executive position in a great industry.
Henry's case reveals, so to speak, an accelerated maturation to an independent and responsible manliness. It represents an initiation into the reality of outer life, a strengthening of the ego and of his masculinity, and with this a completion of the first half of the i n d i v i d u a t i o n process. T h e second half—which is the establishment of a right relationship between the ego and the Self—still lies ahead of Henry, in the second half of his life. Not every case runs such a successful and stirring course, and not every case can be handled in a similar way. O n the contrary, every case is different. Not only d o the y o u n g and the old, or the man and the woman, call for different t r e a t m e n t ; so does every individual in all these categories. Even the same symbols require different interpretation in each case. I have selected this one because it represents an especially impressive example of the autonomy of the unconscious processes and shows by its a b u n d a n c e of images the untiring symbol-creating power of the psychic background. It proves that the self-regulating action of the psyche (when not disturbed by too much rational explanation or dissection) can support the development process of the soul.

In Psychology and Alchemy Dr. J u n g discusses a sequence of over 1000 dreams produced by one man. The sequence revealed a striking number and variety of representations of the m a n d a l a m o t i f — w h i c h is so o f t e n linked with the realization of the Self (see pp. 213 ff.). These pages present a few examples of mandala imagery from the dreams, to indicate the vastly different forms in w h i c h this archetype can manifest itseif, even in one individual's unconscious. The interpretative meanings offered here may, because of their brevity, seem to be arbitrary assertions. In practice no Jungian would produce an interpretation of a dream without knowledge of the dreamer and careful study of his associations to the dream. These interpretative statements must be taken as hints toward possible meanings — nothing more.
Left: In the dream the anima accuses the man of being inattentive to her. A clock says five minutes to the hour. The man is being " p e s t e r e d " by his unconscious: the tension thus created is heightened by the clock, by waiting for something to happen in five minutes.
Below: A skull (which the man tries in vain to kick away) becomes a red ball, then a woman's head. Here the man may try to reject the unconscious (kicking the skull), but it asserts itself by m e a n s of the ball (perhaps alluding to the sun) and the anima figure.



Left: In part of a dream, a prince places a diamond ring on the fourth finger of the dreamer's left hand. The ring, w o r n like a wedding ring, indicates that the dreamer has taken a " v o w " to the Self. Below left: A veiled w o m a n uncovers her face, w h i c h shines like the sun. The image implies an illumination of the unconscious (involving the anima) — quite different from conscious elucidation. Below: From a transparent sphere containing small spheres, a green plant grows. The sphere symbolizes unity: the plant, life and growth.
Below: Troops, no longer preparing for war, form an eight-rayed star and rotate to the left. This image perhaps indicates that some inner conflict has given way to harmony.



Conclusion: M.-L. von Franz
Science and the unconscious
In the preceding chapters C. G.Jung and some of his associates have tried to make clear the role played by the symbol-creating function in man's unconscious psyche and to point out some fields of a p p l i c a t i o n in this newly discovered area of life. W e are still far from understanding the unconscious or the archetypes — those dynamic nuclei of the psyche — in all their i m p l i c a tions. All we c a n see n o w is t h a t t h e a r c h e t y p e s have an enormous impact on the individual, forming his emotions and his ethical and mental outlook, influencing his relationships with others, and thus affecting his whole destiny. We can also see that the arrangement of archetypal symbols follows a pattern of wholeness in the individual, and that an appropriate understanding of the symbols can have a healing effect. And we can see that the archetypes can act as creative or destructive forces in our mind: creative when they inspire new ideas, destructive when these same ideas stiffen into conscious prejudices that inhibit further discoveries.
J u n g has shown in his chapter how subtle and differentiated all attempts at interpretation must be, in order notto weaken the specific individual and cultural values of archetypal ideas and symbols by leveling them out--i.e. by giving them a stereotyped, intellectually formulated meani n g . J u n g himsclfdedicated his entire life to such investigations and interpretative work; naturally this book sketches only an infinitesimal part of his vast c o n t r i b u t i o n to this n e w field of psychological discovery. He was a pioneer and remained fully aware that an enormous n u m b e r of further questions remained unanswered and call for further investigation. T h i s is w h y his concepts and hypotheses are conceived on as wide a basis as possible (without making them too v a g u e a n d a l l - e m b r a c i n g ) a n d w h y his views form a so-called "open system" that does not close the door against possible new discoveries.
To Jung, his concepts were mere tools or heuristic hypotheses that might help us to ex
plore the vast new area of reality opened up by the discovery of the unconscious— a discovery that has not merely widened our whole view of the world but has in fact doubled it. We must always ask now whether a mental phenomenon is conscious or unconscious a n d , also, w h e t h e r a " r e a l " o u t e r p h e n o m e n o n is perceived by conscious or unconscious means. T h e powerful forces of the unconscious most certainly appear not only in clinical material but also in the mythological, religious, artistic, and all the other cultural activities by which m a n expresses himself. Obviously, if all men have common inherited patterns of emotional and mental behavior (which Jung called the a r c h e t y p e s ) , it is only to be expected t h a t we shall find their p r o d u c t s (symbolic fantasies, t h o u g h t s , a n d actions) in practically every field of h u m a n activity. I m p o r t a n t modern investigations of many of these fields h a v e been d e e p l y influenced by Jung's work. For instance, this influence can be seen in the study of literature, in such books as J . B. Priestley's Literature and Western Man, Gottfried D i e n e r ' s Fausts Weg zu Helena, or J a m e s K i r s c h ' s Shakespeare's Hamlet. Similarly, Jungian psychology has contributed to the study of art, as in the writings of Herbert Read or of Aniela Jaffe, Erich Neumann's examination of Henry Moore, or Michael Tippett's studies in music. Arnold Toynbee's work on history and Paul Radin's on anthropology have benefited from Jung's teachings, as have the contributions to sinology made by Richard Wilhelm, Enwin Rousselle, and Manfred Porkert.

Of course, this does not mean that the special features of art and literature (including their i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s ) c a n be u n d e r s t o o d only from their a r c h e t y p a l f o u n d a t i o n . T h e s e fields all have their own laws of activity; like all really creative achievements, they cannot ultimately be rationally explained. But within their areas of action one can recognize the archetypal patterns as a dynamic background activity. And one can often decipher in them (as in dreams) the message of some seemingly purposive, evolutionary tendency of the unconscious. T h e fruitfulness ofJ u n g ' s ideas is m o r e i m m e diately understandable within the area of the cultural activities of m a n : Obviously, if the archetypes determine our mental behavior, they must a p p e a r in all these fields. But, u n e x p e c t edly, Jung's concepts have also opened up new ways of looking at things in the realm of the natural sciences as well—for instance, in biology. The physicist Wolfgang Pauli has pointed out that, due to new discoveries, our idea of the evolution of life requires a revision that might take into account an area of interrelation between the unconscious psyche and biological processes. Until recently it was assumed that the mutation of species happened at r a n d o m and that a selection took place by means of which the "meaningful," well-adapted varieties survived, and the others disappeared. But modern evolutionists have pointed out that the selections of such mutations by pure chance would have t a k e n m u c h longer t h a n the k n o w n age of o u r planet allows.
Jung's concept of synchronicity may be helpful here, for it could t h r o w light u p o n the occurrence of certain rare "border-phenomena," or exceptional events; thus it might explain how "meaningful" adaptations and mutations could h a p p e n in less time than that required by entirely r a n d o m mutations. T o d a y we know of many instances in which meaningful "chance" events have occurred w h e n an a r c h e t y p e is activated. For example, the history of science contains many cases of simultaneous invention or discovery. O n e of the most famous of such cases involved Darwin and his theory of the origin of
species: Darwin had developed the theory in a lengthy essay, and in 1844 was busy expanding this into a major treatise. While he was at work on this project he received a manuscript from a young biologist, unknown to Darwin, named A. R. Wallace. The manuscript was a shorter but otherwise parallel exposition of Darwin's theory. At the time Wallace was in the Molucca Islands of the Malay Archipelago. He knew of Darwin as a naturalist, but had not the slightest idea of the kind of theoretical work on which Darwin was at the time engaged. In each case a creative scientist had independently arrived at a hypothesis that was to change the entire development of the science. And each had initially conceived of the hypothesis in an intuitive "flash" (later backed up by documentary evidence). The archetypes thus seem to appear as the agents, so to speak, of a creatio continua. ( W h a t J u n g calls synchronistic events are in fact something like "acts of creation in time.") Similar "meaningful coincidences" can be said to occur w h e n there is a vital necessity for an individual to know about, say, a relative's death, or some lost possession. In a great many cases such information has been revealed by means of extrasensory perception. This seems to suggest that abnormal random phenomena m a y occur w h e n a vital need or urge is aroused; a n d this in turn might explain why a species of animals, under great pressure or in great need, could p r o d u c e " m e a n i n g f u l " ( b u t acausal) changes in its outer material structure.
But t h e most p r o m i s i n g field for future studies seems (as J u n g saw it) to have unexpectedly o p e n e d u p in c o n n e c t i o n w i t h the c o m p l e x field of microphysics. At first sight, it seems most u n likely t h a t we s h o u l d find a r e l a t i o n s h i p b e t w e e n psychology and microphysics. The interrelation of these sciences is worth some explanation. T h e most obvious aspect of such a connection lies in the fact that most of the basic concepts of physics (such as space, time, matter, energy, c o n t i n u u m or field, p a r t i c l e , etc.) w e r e originally intuitive, semi-mythological, archetypal ideas of the old Greek philosophers — ideas that
306



then slowly evolved and became more accurate and that today are mainly expressed in abstract mathematical terms. The idea of a particle, for instance, was formulated by the fourth-century B.C. Greek philosopher Leucippus and his pupil Democritus, who called it the " a t o m " i.e. the "indivisible unit." Though the atom has not proved indivisible, we still conceive matter ultimately as consisting of waves and particles (or discontinuous "quanta"). T h e idea of energy, and its relationship to force and movement, was also formulated by early Greek thinkers, and was developed by Stoic philosophers. They postulated the existence of a sort of life-giving " t e n s i o n " (tonos), which s u p p o r t s a n d moves all things. T h i s is obviously a semi-mythological germ of our modern concept of energy. Even comparatively modern scientists and thinkers have relied on half-mythological, archetypal images when building up new concepts. In the 17th century, for instance, the absolute validity of the law of causality seemed "proved" to Rene Descartes "by the fact that God is i m m u t a b l e in His decisions a n d a c t i o n s . " And the great German astronomer Johannes Kepler asserted that there arc not more and not less than three dimensions of space on account of the Trinity.
These are just two examples among many that show how even our modern and basic scientific concepts remained for a long time linked with archetypal ideas that originally came from the unconscious. They do not necessarily express "objective" facts (or at least we cannot prove that they ultimately do) butspring from innate mental tendencies in man — tenden
cies that induce him to find "satisfactory" rational explanatory connections between the various outer and inner facts with which he has to deal. When examining nature and the universe, instead of looking for a n d finding objective qualities, " m a n encounters himself," in the phrase of the physicist Werner Heisenberg. Because of the implications of this point of view, Wolfgang Pauli and other scientists have begun to study the role of archetypal symbolism in the realm of scientific concepts. Pauli believed that we should parallel our investigation of outer objects with a psychological investigation of t h e inner origin of o u r scientific concepts. (This investigation might shed new light on a far-reaching concept to be introduced later in this chapter—the concept of a "one-ness" between the physical and psychological spheres, quantitative and qualitative aspects of reality.)
Besides this rather obvious link between the psychology of the unconscious and physics, there, are other even more fascinating connections. J u n g (working closely with Pauli) discovered that analytical psychology has been forced by investigations in its o w n field to c r e a t e concepts that turned out later to be strikingly similar to those created by the physicists when confronted with microphysical phenomena. One of the most i m p o r t a n t a m o n g the physicists' concepts is Niels Bohr's idea of complementarity. Modern microphysics has discovered that one can describe light only by means of two logically opposed but complementary concepts: The ideas of particle and wave. In grossly simplified terms, it might be said that u n d e r certain exp e r i m e n t a l c o n d i t i o n s light manifests itself as if it were composed of particles; u n d e r others, as
The American physicist Mrs. Maria Mayer, w h o in 1963 shared the Nobel prize for physics Her d i s c o v e r y concerning the constituents of the atomic n u c l e u s — was made like so many other scientific discoveries: in an intuitive flash of insight (sparked by a colleague's chance remark). Her theory indicates that the nucleus consists of concentric shells: The innermost contains t w o protons or t w o neutrons, the next contains eight of one or the other, and so on through what she calls the "magic n u m b e r s " — 2 0 , 28, 50, 82.1 26 There is an o b v i o u s link b e t w e e n this model and the archetypes of the
sphere a n d of n u m b e r s 3<>7



if it were a w a v e . Also, it was discovered that we can accurately observe either the position or the velocity of a subatomic particle - but not both at once. The observer must choose his experimental set-up, but by doing so he excludes (or rather must "sacrifice") some other possible setup and its results. Furthermore, the measuring apparatus has to be included in the description of events because it has a decisive but uncontrollable influence upon the experimental set-up.
Pauli says: " T h e science of microphysics, on account of the basic 'complementary' situation, is faced with the impossibility of e l i m i n a t i n g the effects of the observer by determinable correctives and has therefore to abandon in principle any objective understanding of physical phenomena. Where classical physics still saw 'determined causal natural laws of nature' we now look only for 'statistical laws' with 'primary possibilities.' " In other words, in microphysics the observer interferes with the experiment in a way that cannot be measured and that therefore cannot be eliminated. No natural laws can be formulated, saying "such-and-such will happen in every c a s e . " All the microphysicist can say is "such-and-such is, according to statistical probability, likely to happen." This naturally represents a tremendous problem for our classical physical thinking. It requires a consideration, in a scientific experiment, of the mental outlook of the participant-observer: It could thus be said that scientists can no longer hope to describe any aspects of outer objects in a completely "objective" manner.
Most modern physicists have accepted the fact that the role played by the conscious ideas of a n observer in every m i c r o p h y s i c a l experiment cannot be eliminated; but they have not concerned themselves with the possibility that the total psychological c o n d i t i o n ( b o t h conscious and unconscious) of the observer might play a role as well. As Pauli points out, however, we h a v e at least no a priori reasons for rejecting this possibility. But we must look at this as a still unanswered and an unexplored problem.
Bohr's idea of c o m p l e m e n t a r i t y is especially interesting to J u n g i a n psychologists, for J u n g
saw that the relationship between the conscious and unconscious mind also forms a complementary pair of opposites. Each new content that comes u p from the unconscious is altered in its basic nature by being partly integrated into the conscious mind of the observer. Even dream contents (if noticed at all) are in that way semi-conscious. And each enlargement of the observer's consciousness caused by dream interpretation has again an immeasurable repercussion and influence on the unconscious. Thus the unconscious can only be approximately described (like the particles of microphysics] by p a r a d o x i c a l c o n c e p t s . W h a t it really is "in itself" we shall never know, just as we shall never know this about matter.
To take the parallels between psychology and microphysics even further: What J u n g calls the archetypes (or patterns of emotional and mental behavior in man) could just as well be called, to use Pauli's term, " p r i m a r y possibilities" of psychic reactions. As has been stressed in this book, there are no laws governing the specific form in which an archetype might appear. There are only "tendencies" (see p. 67) that, again, enable us to say only that such-and-such is likely to h a p p e n in certain psychological situations.
As the American psychologist William James once pointed out, the idea of an unconscious could itself be compared to the "field" concept in physics. We might say that, just as in a magnetic field the particles e n t e r i n g into it a p p e a r in a certain order, psychological contents also appear in an ordered way within that psychic a r e a w h i c h we call the unconscious. If we call something "rational" or "meaningful" in our conscious mind, and accept it as a satisfactory " e x p l a n a t i o n " of things, it is p r o b a b l y d u e to the fact t h a t o u r conscious e x p l a n a t i o n is in harmony with some preconscious constellation of contents in our unconscious. In other words, our conscious representations are sometimes ordered (or arranged in a pattern) before they h a v e b e c o m e conscious to us. The 19th-century German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss gives an example of an experience of such an unconscious order of ideas: He
308



says that he found a certain rule in the theory of numbers "not by painstaking research, but by the Grace of God, so to speak. T h e riddle solved itself as lightning strikes, a n d I myself could not tell or show the connection between what I knew before, what I last used to experim e n t w i t h , a n d w h a t p r o d u c e d the final success." T h e F r e n c h scientist H e n r i Poincare is even more explicit about this phenomenon; he describes how during a sleepless night he actually watched his mathematical representations colliding in him until some of them "found a more stable connection. O n e feels as if one could watch one's own unconscious at work, the unconscious activity partially becoming manifest to consciousness without losing its own character. At such moments one has an intuition of the difference between the mechanisms of the two egos."
As a final e x a m p l e of parallel d e v e l o p m e n t s in microphysics and, psychology, we can consider J u n g ' s c o n c e p t of meaning. W h e r e before men looked for causal (i.e. rational) explanations of phenomena, J u n g introduced the idea of looking for the meaning (or, perhaps we could say, the " p u r p o s e " ) . T h a t is, rather than ask why s o m e t h i n g h a p p e n e d (i.e. w h a t caused it), J u n g asked : What did it happen for? This same tendency appears in physics: Many modern physicists are now looking more for "connections" in nature than for causal laws (determinism).
Pauli expected that the idea of the unconscious would spread beyond the "narrow frame of therapeutic use" and would influence all natural sciences t h a t deal with general life phenomena. Since Pauli suggested this development he has been echoed by some physicists who are concerned with the new science of cybernetics— the comparative study of the "control" system formed by the brain and nervous system and such mechanical or electronic information and control systems as computers. In short, as the modern French scientist Oliver Costa de Beauregard has put it, science and psychology should in future "enter into an active dialogue."
The unexpected parallelisms of ideas in psychology and physics suggest, asJ u n g pointed
o u t , a possible u l t i m a t e one-ness of b o t h fields of reality that physics and psychology study—i.e. a psychophysical one-ness of all life p h e n o m e n a . J u n g was even convinced that what he calls the unconscious somehow links up with the structure of inorganic matter—a link to which the problem of so-called "psychosomatic" illness seems to point. T h e concept of a unitarian idea of reality (which has been followed up by Pauli and Erich Neumann) was called by Jung t h e unus mundus (the o n e w o r l d , w i t h i n which matter and psyche are not yet discriminated or separately actualized). He paved the way toward such a unitarian point of view by pointing out that an archetype shows a "psychoid" (i.e. not purely psychic but almost material) aspect when it appears within a synchronistic eventfor such a n e v e n t is in effect a meaningful a r r a n g e m e n t of i n n e r psychic a n d outer facts.
I n o t h e r w o r d s , t h e a r c h e t y p e s n o t only fit into outer situations (as animal patterns of beh a v i o r fit into their s u r r o u n d i n g n a t u r e ) ; at bottom they tend to become manifest in a synchronistic "arrangement" that includes both matter and psyche. But these statements are just hints at some directions in which the investigation of life p h e n o m e n a m i g h t proceed. J u n g felt t h a t we s h o u l d first l e a r n a g r e a t deal m o r e about the interrelation of these two areas (matter and psyche) before rushing into too many abstract speculations about it. T h e field t h a t J u n g himself felt w o u l d be most fruitful for further investigations was the study of o u r basic m a t h e m a t i c a l axiomata—which Pauli calls "primary mathematical intuitions," and among which he especially mentions the ideas of an infinite series of numbers in arithmetic, or of a continuum in geometry, etc. As the German-born author Hannah Arendt has said, "with the rise of modernity, mathematics do not simply enlarge their content or reach out into the infinite to become applicable to the immensity of an infinite and infinitely growing, expanding universe, but cease to be concerned with appearance at all. They are no longer the beginnings of philosophy, or the 'science' of Being in its true appearance, but become instead t h e science of the s t r u c t u r e of the

human mind." (A Jungian would at once add the question: Which mind? The conscious or the unconscious mind?) As we have seen with reference to the experiences of Gauss and Poincare, the mathematicians also discovered the fact that our representations are "ordered" before we become aware of them. B. L. van der Waerden, who cites many examples of essential mathematical insights arising from the unconscious, concludes: " . . . the unconscious is not only able to associate a n d c o m b i n e , b u t even tojudge. T h e j u d g m e n t of the unconscious is a n intuitive o n e , b u t it is u n d e r favorable circumstance's completely sure." Among the many mathematical primary intuitions, or a priori ideas, the " n a t u r a l n u m bers" seem psychologically the most interesting. Not only do they serve our conscious everyday measuring and counting operations; they have for centuries been the only existing means for " r e a d i n g " the meaning of such ancient forms of divination as astrology, numerology, geomancy, etc. all of which are based on arithmetical computation and all of,which have been investigated by J u n g in terms of his theory of synchronicity. Furthermore, the natural numbers — viewed from a psychological angle — must certainly be archetypal representations, for we are forced to think about them in certain definite ways. N o b o d y , for i n s t a n c e , c a n d e n y t h a t 2 is the only existing even p r i m a r y n u m b e r , even if he has never thought about it consciously before. In other words, numbers are not concepts consciously invented by men for purposes of c a l c u l a t i o n : T h e y are s p o n t a n e o u s a n d autonomous products of the unconscious — as are other archetypal symbols.
But the natural numbers are also qualities adherent to outer objects: We can assert and count that there are two stones here or three trees there. Even if we strip outer objects of all such qualities as color, temperature, size, etc., there still remains their "many-ness" or special multiplicity. Yet these same numbers are also just as indisputably parts of our own mental set-up — abstract concepts that we can study without looking at outer objects. Numbers thus appear to be a tangible connection between the
spheres of matter and psyche. According to hints d r o p p e d by J u n g , it is here t h a t the most fruitful field of further investigation m i g h t be found. I mention these rather difficult concepts briefly in order to show that, to me, Jung's ideas do not form a "doctrine" but are the beginning of a new outlook that will continue to evolve and expand. I hope they will give the reader a glimpse into what seems to me to have been essential to and typical of Jung's scientific attitude. He was always searching, with unusual freedom from conventional prejudices, and at the same time with great modesty and accuracy, to understand the p h e n o m e n o n of life. He did not go further into the ideas mentioned above, because he felt that he had not yet enough facts in hand to say anything relevant about them—just as he generally waited several years before publishing his new insights, checking them again and again in the meantime, and himself raising every possible doubt about them.
T h e r e f o r e , w h a t m i g h t a t first sight strike the reader as a certain vagueness in his ideas comes in fact from this scientific attitude of intellectual modesty- -an attitude that does not exclude (by rash, superficial pseudo-explanations and oversimplifications) new possible discoveries, and that respects the complexity of the phenomenon of life. For this phenomenon was always an exciting mystery to J u n g . It was never, as it is for people with closed minds, an "explained" reality about which it can be assumed that we know everything. Creative ideas, in my opinion, show their value in that, like keys, they help to "unlock" hitherto unintelligible connections of facts and thus enable man to penetrate deeper into the mystery of life. I am convinced that Jung's ideas can serve in this w a y to find a n d i n t e r p r e t n e w facts in m a n y fields of science ( a n d also of everyday life), simultaneously leading the individual to a more balanced, more ethical, and wider conscious outlook. If the reader should feel stimulated to work further on the investigation and assimilation of the unconsciouswhich always begins by working on oneselfthe purpose of this introductory book would be fulfilled.

At three o'clock they mustered the crew to go aboard, when, to their inexpressible astonishment, they saw two men flying rapidly toward them through the air. O n e was dressed in black, the other in grey. They c a m e past them very closely, in greatest haste, and to their utmost dismay descended into the crater of the terrible volcano, M o u n t Stromboli. T h e y recognized the pair as acquaintances from London." F r o m F .

About the noon-tide hour, however, when the captain and his men were together again, they suddenly saw a man coming toward them through the air, and a voice said d i s t i n c t l y : ' I t is t i m e !

(Continued from front flap)
More than 500 illustrations complement the text and provide a unique "running commentary" on Jung's thought. They show the nature and function of dreams; explore the symbolic meaning of modern art; and reveal the psychological meanings of the ordinary experiences of everyday life. They are a reinforcement to Jung's thought and an integral part of MAN
AND His SYMBOLS.
. . [Contemporary man] is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by 'powers' liiiu are beyond his control. His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, foodand, above all, an impressive array of neuroses."
