Remembering the Deer Mother of Winter Solstice

Doe, A Deer, A Female Reindeer: The Spirit of Mother
Christmas
"Oh wondrous headed doe... Amongst its horns it carries the light of
the blessed sun...” ~ Hungarian Christmas Folk Song
Long before Santa charioted his flying steeds across our mythical
skies, it was the female reindeer who drew the sleigh of the sun
goddess at winter solstice. It was when we “Christianized” the pagan
traditions of winter, that the white bearded man i.e. “Father
Christmas” was born.



Today it is her beloved image that adorns Christmas cards and Yule
decorations – not Rudolph. Because unlike the male reindeer who
sheds his antlers in winter, it is the larger and stronger doe, who
retains her antlers. And it is she who leads the herds in winter.



So this season, when we gather by the fire to tell children bedtime
stories of Santa and his flying reindeer – why not tell the story of the
ancient Deer Mother of old? It was she who once flew through
winterʼs longest darkest night with the life-giving light of the sun in
her horns.



Ever since the early Neolithic, when the earth was much colder and
reindeer more widespread, the female reindeer was venerated by
northern people. She was the “life-giving mother”, the leader of the
herds upon which they depended for survival, and they followed the
reindeer migrations for milk, food, clothing and shelter.



And from the British Isles, Scandinavia, Russia, Siberia, across the
land bridge of the Bering Strait, she was a revered spiritual figure
associated with fertility, motherhood, regeneration and the rebirth of
the sun (the theme of winter solstice).

Her antlers adorned shrines and altars, were buried in ceremonial
graves, and were worn as shamanic headdresses. Her image was
etched in standing stones, woven into ceremonial cloth and clothing,
cast in jewelry, painted on drums, and tattooed onto skin.

The reindeer was often shown leaping or flying through the air with
neck outstretched and legs flung out fore and aft. Her antlers were
frequently depicted as the tree of life, carrying birds, the sun, moon
and stars. And across the northern world, it was the Deer Mother
who took flight from the dark of the old year to bring light and life to
the new.



For the Sami, the indigenous people of the Nordic countries, Beaivi is
the name for the Sun Goddess associated with motherhood, the
fertility of plants and the reindeer. At Winter solstice, warm butter (a
symbol of the sun) was smeared on doorposts as a sacrifice to Beaivi
so that she could gain strength and fly higher and higher into the
sky. Beivve was often shown accompanied by her daughter in an
enclosure of reindeer antlers and together they returned green and
fertility to the land.



Many winter goddesses in northern legends were associated with
solstice. They took to the skies led by a bevy of flying animals. One
tells of the return of Saule, the Lithuanian and Latvian goddess of the
sun. She flew across the heavens in a sleigh pulled by horned
reindeer and threw pebbles of amber (symbolizing the sun) into
chimneys.



Mary B. Kellyʼs book Goddess Embroideries Of Eastern Europe
explores images of the horned deer mother in the sacred textiles of
women. The image of the mother goddess Rohanitsa is often shown
with antlers and gives birth to deer as well as children. For her feast
day in late December (most likely solstice) white iced cookies
shaped like deer were given as presents or good luck tokens, and
red and white embroidery depicting her image were displayed.

In Siberian legends the reindeer took flight each winter after
ingesting the hallucinogenic Amanita Muscaria mushroom, the
archetypal red toadstool with white spots. Shamans would join them
on a vision quest, by taking the mushrooms themselves. Climbing
the tree of life in her horns, they would take flight like a bird into the
upper realms. Other folktales tell how shamans, dressed in red suits
with white spots, would collect the mushrooms and then deliver
them through chimneys as gifts on the winter solstice. Talk about a
wild night.



While many historical explorations of the pagan origins of Christmas
observe the link between Santaʼs garb and the red and white amanita
mushroom ingesting shaman, few mention that is was the female
shamans who originally wore red and white costumes trimmed with
fur, horned headdresses or felt red hats! The ceremonial clothing
worn by medicine women healers of Siberia and Lapland, was green
and white with a red peaked hat, curled toed boots, reindeer mittens,
fur lining and trim. Sound familiar?

Considering that most of the shamans in this region were originally
women, it is likely that their traditional wear is the true source for
Santaʼs costume. And it is also very likely that they were the first to
take shamanic flight with the reindeer on winterʼs darkest night.



And while these women are largely forgotten today, the Deer Mother
still lives in our Christmas cards, seasonal decorations and tales of
Santaʼs flying reindeer. And while we may not recognize her, I believe
some deep, old part of ourselves still remembers the original
“Mother Christmas” who brought light and new life to the world.
So this solstice take a moment to remember the forgotten winter
goddesses of old and their magical reindeer. Look out from your
warm cozy home into the cold of the darkening eve. And on the



sacred night when the sun is reborn, look for the Deer Mother flying
across starry skies, carrying the tree of life in her horns.
POSTSCRIPT
(By Danielle Prosom Olson) This postscript is in response to the
many comments and requests Iʼve received for the sources of the
above post. Many have never heard of the Deer Mother or her female
shaman -which is no surprize. Today the internet is awash with
articles examining the pagan origins of Christmas but what is
consistently overlooked is the idea that there may have been a
feminine source for yule traditions.
For example, a plethora of “alternative” articles observe the link
between Santaʼs red and white garb and the Siberian shaman, and
consistently refer to this shaman as “him”. Little mention is made
that this ceremonial clothing was worn by the earliest shamans in the



northern regions who were -and still are – female. In fact the leader
of the Mongolian Reindeer People, according to this source, is a 96
year-old shaman known as Tsuyan.
And when it comes to the deer, well there is much talk of the
stag, but little mention of what was once an important spiritual figure
to our northern ancestors – the Deer Mother. Much historical
scholarship has assumed that many horned images found in archaic
relics, ritual objects and artwork were male. But considering the
evidence for a reindeer mother goddess cult dating from the
prehistoric, many scholars now suggest that some of these images
may be in fact, female reindeer.
That early female shaman wore horned headdresses and antlers is
also well documented. In Miranda Greenʼs book Symbol and Image in
Celtic Religious Art she states, “animal symbolism associated with
goddesses reachs it apogee with horned female images, usually
adorned with antlers.”

Green makes the point that while the antlered god Cernunnos is well
known in eastern Gaul (and is revered in many pagan circles today)
there were also feminine counterparts found in at many sites such as
Clermont-Ferrand (Puy de Dome) and at Besancon (Doubs).



Esther Jacobson compiled the deer iconography of the early nomads
of South Siberia and northern Central Asia. Her book The Deer
Goddess Of Ancient Siberia: A Study In The Ecology Of Belief traces
the image of the deer from rock carvings, paintings, and monolithic
stelae from the Neolithic period down through the early Iron Age.
And her study demonstrates that this deer goddess “religion
“revolved around female “wise woman” and the Deer Mother
herself.



The deer goddess was known across northern Europe. From The
Deer-Cult and the Deer-Goddess Cult of the Ancient Caledonians by
J.G. McKay “There are an immense number of traditions, references,
notices of customs, and various minor matters, which show
conclusively that there formerly existed in the Highlands of Scotland
two cults, probably pre-Celtic, a deer-cult and a deer-goddess cult.
The latter cult was administered by women only...”



Antlered female shaman (believed to be Nishan from NE Asia)
The book The Golden Deer of Eurasia published by the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, is a wonderful visual exploration of the sacred
significance of the deer and reindeer in the shamanic traditions
which “was understood as essentially female” and associated with
the tree of life, fertility, motherhood birth and the rebirth of the sun
(the theme of winter solstice!)
According to this lovely article “Reindeer and the Sun are very
common association in Siberian shamanism. Tattoos on buried
shaman women also contain deer tattoos, featuring antlers
embellished with small birdsʼ heads, and since the goddess cultures
of female shaman is most associated with deer, serpent and birds, it
is right that these deer stones were the sacred ritual grounds of
women. This reindeer-sun-bird imagery can symbolize the female



shamanʼs soul transformation from human to deer, from earth of the
middle world to higher gates of the middle world and even the lower
world.”

Germany”
This fascinating article describes the ancient traditional clothing



worn by “Medicine Women Healers” in Siberia and what once known
as Lapland. “The red peaked, felted hats and curled-toe boots and
warm mittens of reindeer-hide complete, what I believe to be, the
feminine origins of perhaps the first of a very long line of Santa Claus
replications. Their long lineage of connection with the induction of
spiritual journeys through the drum, their relationship of healing with
“Reindeer-Magic” and their ability to create potions and salves
which could incite ecstatic visions or “Shamanic Journeys,” give us a
deeper look at the Solstice and contemporary Christmas symbol.
These priestesses-of-the-antlered-ones who flew through the night
to gather blessings and healing and then distributed these gifts to
their tribe members must surely be considered as proto-typical
Fore-Mothers of Santa.”
So based on these sources (and I could go on!) it seems quite
certain that there once an ancient deer mother goddess associated
with the sun at winter solstice. It also seems likely that female
shamans took to shamanic flight with the Deer Mother on this sacred
night.
Today some of our most cherished Christmas iconography features
antlered “stags”. Why does this image still speak so strongly to us?
Could it be that they evoke an ancient memory? Are we remembering
the long forgotten mother of winter solstice? I like to think so.
