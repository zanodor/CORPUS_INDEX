A tribute with 10 deciphered signs and homage to the late Iravatham Mahadevan whose life mission was decipherment of Indus Script
I request you to kindly browse the blogpost and academia.edu monographed posted today on Indus Script (Links provided below). I offer this as my homage and tribute to my guru -- the late Iravatham Mahadevan ji whose contributions to the study of Indus Script are par excellence.
I request that Roja Muthiah Centre, Chennai founded by him should celebrate that his life mission has been accomplished. Sign 342 the most frequent sign exquisitely orthographed in the late Iravatham Mahadevan Concordance (ASI 1977) has been conclusively deciphered.
The challenge is for Roja Muthiah Centre (RMC, Roja Muthiah Research Library – The Indus Research Centre, http://rmrl.in/ ) dedicated to the study of Indus Script and civilization; it is for RMC scholars to debate the decipherment.
