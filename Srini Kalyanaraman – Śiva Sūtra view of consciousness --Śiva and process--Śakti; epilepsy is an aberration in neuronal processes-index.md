Śiva Sūtrāṇi of Vasugupta. Commentaries by Subhash Kak (2018) & Pavel Celba
(2009). Dance-step intimations from Indus Script
Śiva Sūtra is an extraordinary document which delves into the subject of consciousness,
which is a domain in the frontier of knowledge in neurosciences or unraveling the brain
mind false categories. The false categories are resolved by defining ātman as
'consciousness or caitanya'.
In an epilectic state, caitanya is disturbed. The patient is not brain-dead; he or she just
loses the caitanya or sensory perceptions related to the outside world. Such sensory
perceptions are defined as ātman.
The Cosmic dance of Śiva is a metaphor for this human condition of epilepsy signified by
the apasmāra or muyalakaṉ -- over whose body, the dance of brain-mind false category is
performed. muyalakaṉ , n. 3. 1. A Bhūta over whose body Naṭarāja
dances; நட ந . ட ( . 878, 3). 2.

v.tr.&intr. 1. To practise, persevere, make continued exertion; ட

pains; . ( . 19). 3. To begin,
undertake; ட . That is, epilepsy is a condition when the the body loses the



process of exertion or perseverence. This aberration is the crux of the enquiry into
epilepsy.

Apasmāra on whom the dance is performed signifies epilepsy, a disrupted state of
consciousness.
Framing a neuroscience model of epilepsy will be a major contribution to unravel the
contours of multi-disciplinary consciousness studies.



It appears that a possible cause for this aberration may be related to aberrations in the
brain energy metabolism. There is a blood-brain barrier and the brain neurons and glial
cells draw their energy from the oxygen in the blood-stream which is absorbed across
the blood-brain barrier. What happens in this process of absorbing oxygen which
powers or is the energy source for the brain?
I submit that this should be the field of enquiry to unravel not only epilepsy but medically
define consciousness or ॥
The Śiva Sūtra of Vasu Gupta
1. Śāmbhavopāya, Śiva’s View
1.1 Consciousness is the self. ॥१॥ Pavel Celba -- Enlightened atman
1.2 (Ordinary) knowledge consists of associations. न ब ॥२॥ 2. Restricted himself
consciously into cognizable form
1.3 Emanations of the source are embodied activity. न श ॥३॥ So as to
enter in exact proportions
1.4 The ground of knowledge is mātṛkā. न न ॥४॥. As a basis, into all the
bodies created by Divine Mother
1.5 The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava. ॥५॥ Only by cognition of
Him is it possible to ascend above the terrible Rudra’s forms
2 Śāktopāya, the Process
2.1 The mind is a measure, mantra. ॥१॥ Limited consciousness is the sound of
a mantra
2.2 Effort leads to attainment. ॥२॥ By zealous, spontaneous effort.



2.3 The secret of mantra is the being of the body of
knowledge. श ॥३॥ They will understand the truth about the created
body, which is the mystery of the mantras.
2.4 The emergence of the mind in the womb is like a dream based on inferior
knowledge.
श ॥४॥ Within the heart of limited being the undivided
consciousness keeps dreaming its dream.
2.5 When the knowledge of one’s self arises, one moves in the Sky of Consciousness
— Śiva’s state.
न श ॥५॥ Awareness awakens naturally like a bird soaring
up high towards its true nature of Śiva.
2.6 The guru is the means. ॥६॥ Mistress of all forms
2.7 The awakening of the wheel of mātṛkā(the elemental energies).
ब ॥७॥ is all comprehending Divine Mother.
