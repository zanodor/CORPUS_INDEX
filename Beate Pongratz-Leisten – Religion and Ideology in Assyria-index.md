Acknowledgments
This book is the product of several phases of development. It began as part of a larger project on Ancient Near Eastern religions during the academic year 200304, which I spent at Harvard University with a grant from the Center for the Study of World Religions. My colleagues at the time, Irene Winter, Peter Machinist, Piotr Steinkeller, and Paul-Alain Beaulieu together with their students graciously met with me several times to discuss various aspects of my research. In the years that followed, a draft manuscript emerged and received its most valuable comments from Zainab Bahrani, Benjamin Foster, Bruce Lincoln, and Peter Brown. During the academic year 2007‒08, a grant from the National Endowment of the Humanities enabled me to spend a year at the Institute for Advanced Study, where I enjoyed the privilege of discussing my research in the seminars held by Caroline Bynum and Heinrich von Staden. At this time I narrowed my research focus to emphasize aspects of kingship and ideology in Mesopotamia. In 2009, with my appointment at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University, I worked intensely with my colleagues to build the institution, formulate its vision, and design a graduate program and my research took another turn. I placed the historical development of ideology in Assyria and its intercultural exchange with its neighbors – at center stage, working to delineate it from its beginnings through the Sargonid period in the first millennium BCE. Concomitant with the new research direction, I came to realize the need to clearly elucidate the fascinating interdependency between religion and ideology, which so often have been treated independently rather than as inextricably intertwined in the context of the ancient world. Thanks are due to a number of scholars who kindly offered their comments and questions, and who invited me to present my work for discussion and analysis. Early drafts of several sections were read by Giorgio Buccellati, Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, and Simo Parpola, and I am most grateful for their insightful comments. Productive and inspiring workshops include a 2007 meeting on royal ideology at the University of Pennsylvania, organized by Jane A. Hill, Philip Jones, and Antonio J. Morales; a 2010 meeting in Paris on Middle Assyrian developments in the Hābūr area in 2010 in Paris, organized by Nele Ziegler; a 2011 meeting on divination at the SBL conference in San Francisco, organized by Alan Lenzi and Jonathan Stoekl; a 2013 meeting on intertextuality, organized by Johannes Bach and his peer students at Topoi Berlin; and a 2014 meeting on Transmission, Translation, and Reception, organized by Yoram Cohen and Amir Gilan at Tel Aviv University. These workshops provided the opportunity to discuss aspects of ideology, the relationship between historiography and divination, a topic that I further had the opportunity to intensely dis

cuss with Jean-Jacques Glassner, the intertextuality of what has been distinguished as literary texts and historiographic texts, and the transmission of cultural ideas and cultic practices. Most of my contributions to these workshops have been published in the respective volumes of their proceedings. I decided to rework them into a coherent narrative of this book. My work on historiography also benefited from in-depth discussions with the students in my seminar on Assyrian historiography in spring 2013, and with Peter Machinist, Piotr Michalowski, Jean-Jaques-Glassner, and Nele Ziegler during the concluding workshop, Ancient and Modern Perspectives on Historiography, which I organized at ISAW in April 2013. I am further indebted to my colleague Lorenzo d’Alfonso as well as to all those who attended the Ancient Near Eastern Table at ISAW, where I presented my ideas on religion and ideology in two intense sessions of discussion. Harmut Kühne most generously shared with me his work and thoughts on the development of the Assyrian state on the basis of his long-standing experience with the archaeology of the Hābūr region. I am very grateful to Andrew George who provided me with his insights on the texts from Tigunānum and shared Lambert’s notes on the ritual texts from that site with me. A thorough study of these texts would have delayed the publication of the book and I decided to leave that for a later project. Further thanks are due to Kim Benzel, Dominique Charpin, Yoram Cohen, Jerrold S. Cooper, Betina Faist, Amir Gilan, Jamie Novotny, Francesca Rochberg, Wolfgang Röllig, Daisuke Shibata, Maurizio Viano, and Shigeo Yamada who shared unpublished manuscripts and thoughts with me along the way. I am immensely indebted to my colleagues Daniel Fleming, Marc Smith, and Gonzalo Rubio who most graciously dedicated their time and energy to reading the advanced drafts of the manuscript. Their rigorous and sometimes challenging comments were a great source of inspiration, and I would like to take the opportunity to thank them for their kind friendship over all these years, which is so rare to find in academia. Words cannot express my gratitude to Karen Sonik who not only edited a version of the entire manuscript but also was a most critical and supportive reader. Jonathan Valk edited once more the very final version and showed great patience with my continuous later insertions. Nancy Highcock most effectively helped me with the bibliography and the figures. Last but not least I want to thank ISAW for graciously supporting the workshops I organized over the last years. I dedicate this book to my students at ISAW. Their curiosity and enthusiasm provided a continuous resource of energy and inspiration as I worked to complete this book.

1 Introduction
1.1 Setting the Stage
In his commemorative inscriptions the Assyrian king Tukultī-Ninurta I (12331197 BCE) relates that, subsequent to his victory over Babylon in 1215 BCE, he transferred his residence from the city of Aššur to his newly founded capital, Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta (figs. 1 and 2).1 The construction of the new royal capital had been under way since the early years of his reign, and the ideological message promulgated by Tukultī-Ninurta sought to link Assyria’s victory over Babylon – the time-honored religious center – with the creation of a new political and religious center in Assyria.2 Tukultī-Ninurta’s extraordinary move from Aššur to Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta included not only the building of a new royal palace, but also the attempt to transfer the cult of the god Aššur away from the city Aššur, an act unique in Assyrian history.3 This audacious development took place when the Middle Assyrian state was at the peak of its territorial expansion, counting for a short time Babylonia among its domains. By exploring the ideological discourse employed by Tukultī-Ninurta I to justify his political decisions, I intend to set the stage for an investigation of the history of the cultural discourse surrounding Assyrian kingship from the late third millennium through to the Neo-Assyrian period. First, however, I will shed light on the rich tapestry of traditions implicated in the naming of Tukultī-Ninurta’s new palace, in order to provide the reader with an inkling of the immense potential of possible insights that the modern scholar can gain from taking such choices seriously. The building inscriptions commemorating Tukultī-Ninurta I’s move to KārTukultī-Ninurta record the ceremonial names given to the newly built Aššur temple and to the new royal palace. To my knowledge, this is the only known example in which temple and palace share the same name: “house, mountain of all the me” (é.kur.me.šár.ra),4 and “palace of all the me” (é.gal.me.šár.ra)5 respectively. The name of the palace was rendered in Akkadian as bīt kiššati,

For the name of the temple see George 1993, no. 687. The name is derived from that of Enlil’s temple in Nippur (Machinist 1978, 526). 5 RIMA 1, A.0.78.22:51.

‘house of totality.’ This is not a literal translation of the Sumerian ceremonial name, but instead reflects the title “king of totality,” šar kiššati. As such, it recalls an ideology that had emerged under the kings of Akkad,6 and was then reproduced in the ceremonial name for Tukultī-Ninurta I’s palace in Aššur itself, which was called “house of the king, sovereign of the lands” (é.lugal. umun.kur.kur.ra), evoking the Enlilship of Aššur-Enlil.7 I would like to take this onomastic phenomenon as the point of departure for my discussion of Assyrian royal ideology and ask: what did the king and his scholars have in

4 Introduction
mind when choosing this particular ceremonial name for Tukultī-Ninurta I’s palace in his new residence? How does it relate to their claim of universal control? The Sumerian ceremonial name “Palace of All the me” is reminiscent of names given to temples of Inanna/Ištar, who is renowned in Sumerian mythology for stealing the me from her father Enki in Eridu and bringing them to the city of Uruk.8 Among the temple names evoking this myth are the “house which gathers all the me” (é.me.kìlib.ur4.ur4) of the goddess in Larsa,9 the “house which lifts on high all the me” (é.me.kìlib.ba.sag.íl) of Inanna/Ištars messenger Ninšubur at Girsu?,10 the “house of skillfully-contrived me” (é.me.galam.ma), akītu-temple of Ištar at Akkade,11 the “house of scattered(?) me” (é.me.bir.ra),12 a shrine in Aššur’s temple Ešarra at Aššur, and the “house of the me of Inanna” (é.me.dInanna), the temple of the Assyrian Ištar at Aššur, which in the building inscriptions of Tukultī-Ninurta I appears in its abbreviated form é.me.13 All of these Sumerian ceremonial temple names relate in a condensed form to the mythology surrounding the goddess Inanna/Ištar, and the space of the temple as res extensa of her divine body echoes her “biography.” The goddess, her agency, and her lived-in space within the urban landscape of the Mesopotamian cities had merged into one and become part of the cultural landscape of their inhabitants. As seen by the mythologizing connotations of temple names incorporating the me, Tukultī-Ninurta I’s decision to include the me in the name of his palace was not arbitrary. By referencing the me, Tukultī-Ninurta I demonstrates a desire to connect Assyrian kingship with the divine figure of Ištar. According to the Sumerian myth Inanna and Enki, the me include all the cultural norms, institutions, professions, and positive and negative aspects of human behavior.14 The me also encompass the institution of kingship and its associated insignia, thereby designating Inanna as the patron deity of kingship.15 Although in the later second millennium BCE the meaning of Sumerian me is restricted through its much narrower Akkadian translation as parṣu – “cultic regula

tion”16 – the choice of the name é.gal.me.šár.ra for Tukultī-Ninurta’s palace implies knowledge of its more inclusive ancient meaning and its association with Inanna/Ištar. The Akkadian rendering of this name as “house of totality” in turn projects control over the conquered world, as well as over those regions of the world with which Assyria interacted through peaceful means, primarily trade and diplomatic arbitration. This notion is explicit in the royal title “king of Kish,” which was iconic as early as the reign of king Mesalim of Kish (ca. 2600 BCE).17 By the time of the kings of Akkade, the title had come to mean ‘king of totality,’ šar kiššati, “using the similarity of the name of the city of Kish and the Akkadian term for ‘the entire inhabited world,’ kishshatum.”18 Tukultī-Ninurta I’s ceremonial name for his new palace, consequently, was intended to promulgate the king’s claim to universal control “by the love” of Innana/Ištar; in other words, the king’s effective empowerment through the grace and goodwill of Inanna/Ištar,19 perpetuating an idea that originated in a Sumerian context and was adapted in subsequent periods. This is clear, for instance, in the tradition regarding the legendary king Etana, in which Ištar seeks a suitable individual to occupy the position of king established by the gods.20 In its highly abbreviated form, the ceremonial name of Tukultī-Ninurta I’s palace thus epitomizes the theological metastructure of Assyrian kingship. The centrality of the goddess Ištar to Assyrian kingship is apparent in the fact that Tukultī-Ninurta I committed himself to building a double temple to Ištar-Aššurītu and Dinītu as soon as he ascended the throne, with Dinītu replacing BēlatAkkadî in one version of the building inscriptions.21 To that end, Tukultī-Ninurta demolished the former Ištar temple, justifying this action through the claim that Ištar explicitly communicated her desire for a new building with a different outline.22 Claiming that a specific deity expressed his or her will explicitly is a cultural strategy that we will encounter much later with Sennacherib’s reconfiguration of the Aššur temple in Aššur as well. In Middle Assyrian times, Ištar had multiple cults dedicated to her various manifestations in Aššur alone, among them those of Anunītu, the Assyrian

6 Introduction
Ištar (Ištar-Aššurītu),23 Ištar-of-Heaven (Ištar-ša-šamê), Ištar-of-Nineveh (Ištarša-Ninuaki), Ištar-of-Arbela, and her hypostasis as Bēlet-ekalli and Šarrat-nipha.24 All of these Ištar figures shared a bellicose aspect, which bore upon Ištar’s active, though not exclusive, support for the king during military campaigns intended to actualize his control over ‘totality.’ Ištar’s other central aspect is her role as protector of the king, on whose behalf she mediates with the chief god and the divine assembly. The tropes expressing her protection of the king extend from her role as name-giver in Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures and the Sacred Marriage attested in Sumerian royal hymns25 to her role as nurse and wet nurse of the king in Late Assyrian prophecies. Ištar-Anunītu was introduced in Aššur during the Akkad period, when the kings of Akkad called themselves her ‘favorite’ and her ‘consort,’ and then reintroduced under Tukultī-Ninurta I. It is also during the Middle Assyrian period that we encounter the first evidence for prophetesses in Aššur. The possibility that the institution of prophetesses was similarly (re)-introduced under Tukultī-Ninurta should be kept in mind, as Ištar-Anunītu is well attested in Amorite tradition (Mari in particular) as being a prophesying deity for the king. In any event, all of these tropes share a common emphasis on Ištar’s love for the king.26 In ancient juridical language love signified both the protection of an overlord for his vassal and the loyalty of the vassal to his overlord,27 a view that made its way into Sumero-Babylonian and Assyrian ideological discourse and represents one of the many examples of the close association between religion and law in the ancient Near East. This conceptualization of love constituted one of the most powerful instruments for the legitimization of the king’s occupation of the throne, with the love of Inanna/Ištar guaranteeing the protection and love of the chief god Enlil or Aššur. That this trope enjoyed a broad diffusion through Mesopotamia and Syria is evident also from the archaeological evidence, notably in the close association of the Ištar temple with the palace in Alalah28 and the Old Babylonian representation of the king’s enthronement under the loving supervision of Ištar in Zimrilim’s palace in Mari.29
23 This goddess already existed side by side with Aššur in the Old Assyrian period, see Hirsch 1961, 22. 24 Meinhold 2009. 25 Jones 2003; Lapinkivi 2004; 2008; Rubio 2009, 61‒62. 26 Pongratz-Leisten 2003, 150 ff.; 2008. 27 Moran 1963. 28 Yener 2005, fig. 4.27 and Lauinger 2008. 29 Note, however, that although during the Early Dynastic period the palace contained a large sanctuary, by the Old Babylonian period many of its rooms had been reused for secular purposes and only the cella of Anunitum remained; the temple of Ištar ša ekallim must have been moved outside of the palace, see Heinrich 1982, 133.



Setting the Stage 7
Ištar-Šauška, a Hurrian hypostasis of the goddess Ištar, played a role in the city of Nineveh equivalent to that of Ištar in her various hypostases in the city of Aššur. This is true at least as early as the time of Šamšī-Adad I (18081776 BCE), as during the Hurrian occupation preceding Šamšī-Adad I’s conquest Ištar-Šauška was the consort of Teššub, heading the Hurrian pantheon together with him. Ištar-Šauška’s supra-regional status is acknowledged by Hammurabi in the prologue to his Law Code30 mentioning her and her city among the places he conquered in the Old Babylonian period. As a supra-regional deity Ištar-Šauška appears again in the international treaties concluded by the Hittites with the Mitanni kingdom and other vassals such as Nuhhašše and the Arzawa Country.31 Hammurabi’s epithet in connection with Ištar of Nineveh is interesting: although he is a contemporary of Šamšī-Adad I, Hammurabi refers to Ištar-Šauška’s temple in Nineveh as é.mès.mès where he “proclaimed the me of Ištar.” After renovating the sanctuary originally built by the Old Akkadian king Maništušu,32 Šamšī-Adad I, by contrast, uses the ceremonial name é.me.nu.è “house of the me, which do not leave.” The name chosen for Tukultī-Ninurta I’s palace at Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta thus draws upon a rich tapestry of traditions, woven over hundreds and hundreds of years from Sumero-Babylonian, Amorite and Hurrian traditions alike. It dresses an originally cosmological message in a political garb, indicating that the Assyrian palace (= king) now shares Ištar’s role in controlling the me. With the name é.gal.me.šár.ra, the king is also promoting the palace as the cosmic stronghold, a function formerly reserved for the temple. Note the description of Enki’s temple in Enki’s Journey to Nippur:
Your lock has no rival. Your bolt is a fearsome lion. Your roof beams are the bull of heaven, an artfully made bright headgear. Your reed-mats are like lapis lazuli, decorating the roof-beams. Your vault is a bull (some mss. have instead: wild bull) raising its horns. Your door is a lion who (seizes a man) (1 ms. has instead: is awe-inspiring) Your staircase is a lion coming down on a man.33
With this type of ideological discourse, for the first time, king and palace explicitly emulate the roles and functions formerly ascribed exclusively to the divine world.

8 Introduction
The preceding analysis of the ceremonial name of Tukultī-Ninurta I’s new palace provides a glimpse of the rich texture of Assyrian ideology. It is clear that this ideology draws on various traditions, a fact frequently obscured by the tendency of modern scholarship to categorize these traditions in blunt geographical terms like Southern and Northern Mesopotamia. Also evident is the need to pay close attention to the details of Assyrian ideological discourse and to the complexity of particular features of this discourse, among them royal titulary.34 For instance, as soon as Tukultī-Ninurta I loses control over Babylonia, he abandons the title “king of the four directions.” Tukultī-Ninurta I’s reign is a formative moment in the development of Assyrian royal ideology, heralding the explicit representation of the Assyrian king as an active participant in the establishment of cosmic order in concert with the divine world. To propagate this image of the king effectively, the scholars in his entourage turned to every medium at their disposal – text, image, architecture, and ritual. The motive for the ‘activism’ apparent in official discourse may be sought in the imperialist expansion driving Assyrian politics beginning in the fourteenth century BCE. This expansion resulted in dramatic changes to the ethno-linguistic makeup of Assyria’s population. As more and more nonAssyrian people were integrated into the empire, Assyria became “less and less Assyrian culturally and linguistically.”35 Subsequent large-scale migrations particularly by Aramaeans – deeply affected the cultural landscape. Following the collapse of Hittite control in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent, small Aramaic kingdoms emerged; later, Aramaean populations spread throughout Mesopotamia.36 The Assyrian royal discourse that emerged under Tukultī-Ninurta I with its cosmological and mythic overtones should be considered the ideological response of the scholars working at the Assyrian court to these political developments. One can assume that the rulers of Mesopotamia always relied on the competence of scholars and experts for programmatic statements of their rulership. This is already apparent in the Old Babylonian Period in the elaborate ideological discourse created by king Šamšī-Adad I in response to and as
34 Liverani 1981; Cifola 2004, 14. 35 Beaulieu 2004, 192. 36 The Aramaeans, known in the cuneiform sources as the Aḫlamū, appear already in the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser I as a major force in the area of the Middle Euphrates, which the Assyrian military strove to control. Whether the Ahlamu attested in Sippar-Amnanum during the Old Babylonian period are to be equated with the later Aramaeans as suggested by Lipiński 2000, 37, remains open to debate. On the Assyrian-Aramaean interaction see Fales 1986, 1991, 2000, 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2011.

a consequence of his political activities and in the presence of diviners in the entourage of the kings of Mari and Ešnunna. Nevertheless, a royal scholar in the direct entourage of the king of Assyria emerges for the first time in the figure of Marduk-nādin-ahhē, a descendant of a Babylonian family of scholars, who moved from Babylonia to Aššur to enter into the service of King Aššuruballiṭ I (1353‒1318 BCE) as ṭupšar šarre (scribe/astrologer? of the king).37 This appointment bears witness not only to what later became the institution of the “royal scholar” (ummân šarri) as adviser to the king – an institution spelled out in the Synchronistic King List38 and abundantly attested in Sargonid epistolary literature – but also to the presence of Babylonian scholars at the Assyrian court, known from the Middle Assyrian period at the latest. Naturally, this presence implied new impulses to the formation of Assyrian ideological discourse. Exploring how this discourse both reflected and informed power relations, I will focus specifically on the history of Assyrian kingship and its conception in myth, historiography, ritual, and imagery. An attempt will be made to treat Assyrian kingship in context, demonstrating its receptivity to Sumero-Babylonian tradition on the one hand and to Hittite-Hurrian tradition on the other.39 Further, the ideology of Assyrian kingship will be analyzed as a product of the dynamic interface between political action and the paradigms of rulership developed by erudite scholars in the entourage of the king. At this point I must emphasize that I am well aware of the pitfalls of identifying language groups with concepts of ethnicity and social identity.40 The problem is particularly vexing with regard to the Hurrians, who were ubiquitous in Northern Syria during the third millennium and influenced Assyrian cultural discourse, but whose major cultural expressions – particularly ritual and mythic traditions survived only in the libraries of the Hittite kingdom in the city of Hattuša.
37 Wiggermann 2008; Wiggermann provides a list of several such scholars during the Middle Assyrian period which included also a royal exorcist (āšip šarre) during the reign of Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE). 38 Found at the city of Aššur, this king list is a list of Assyrian and Babylonian kings arranged synchronically, which also names the chief scholars to the kings. Unfortunately there is a large gap in the text covering the kings preceding Tukultī-Ninurta I, so that we do not know exactly when the Assyrians themselves considered this tradition to have started, Weidner 1926; Grayson 1980‒1983, 116‒121 no. 12 and comments by Heeßel 2010, 165 with fn. 55. 39 Peter Machinist has collected the evidence for the military interaction between the Assyrians and Hittites and remains a little doubtful with regard to their cultural interaction (Machinist 2005). I would like to adduce some evidence throughout this book in that regard. See further Harrak 1987, and my discussion in Chapter 4.3. 40 See most recently Michalowski 2011, 84 in his discussion on the Amorites with reference to Kamp and Yoffee 1980; Emberling 1997, and Emberling and Yoffee 1999; on the problem of the Amorite question see most recently Durand 2012 with further bibliography.



10 Introduction
However, as the goal of this book is to identify the formation of the Assyrian ideological discourse in its intercultural exchange with Northern and Southern traditions, this taxonomy will be kept with allude caution.
1.2 Why This Book?
The publication of Albert Ten Eyck Olmstead’s work on Assyrian history in response to Ernst Curtius’ Griechische Geschichte and Theodor Mommsen’s Römische Geschichte41 gave Assyria its own voice in ancient history, and Assyria has fascinated modern scholarship ever since. The Assyrians have left us a vast range of textual and archeological material, presenting the modern scholar with a rare opportunity to trace Assyrian history over the course of two millennia. Situated at the heart of the ancient Near East – between the Iranian mountains to the East, the Syrian steppe to the West, the Anatolian mountain ranges to the North and the alluvial plain of Mesopotamia to the South – Aššur’s existence and survival was predicated on and defined by intense cultural interaction throughout its history. Due to its beneficial geographical location, the city state of Aššur originally operated primarily as a trade hub linking Iran, Southern Iraq, and Anatolia. Developing from its beginnings as a city state, Assyria eventually burst onto the scene of history as the world’s first hegemonic empire, inspiring awe and terror in future generations and informing the work of biblical prophets and Greek historians alike. Archaeological excavation of the Assyrian heartland began as early as the mid-nineteenth century, in the period of colonial appropriation of the Ottoman Empire.42 Initial excavations were centered on the once glorious capitals, which had largely been built during Assyria’s rapid expansion in the first half of the first millennium BCE. Assyria’s monumental palaces, with their expansive reliefs and developed iconography dedicated to the military campaigns of the Assyrian kings, deeply impacted how the modern viewer perceived of that first world empire (fig. 3) and served as an imperialist model for the nationalist ideologies developing in France and Britain at the time.43 Subsequently, approaches to Assyrian history have focused primarily on three goals: (1) writing a history of events;44 (2) reconstructing the historical

Numerous text editions of Assyrian royal inscriptions have been made available through the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia project, formerly headed by A. K. Grayson at the University of Toronto and now under the custodianship of Grant Frame at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as through the published dissertations of Eckart Frahm,47 Andreas Fuchs,48 and the work of Hayim Tadmor.49 A massive edition of the Kujunjik libraries is being published volume by volume through the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project in Helsinki under the directorship of Simo Parpola.

written by ancient scholars to the kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal50 has given these experts an audible voice and laid bare their extensive involvement in royal agency and decision-making.51 Other volumes dedicated to Neo-Assyrian treaties, letters, administrative records, grants, and judicial texts have completely changed the modern perception of how the empire functioned. Together, these projects have added tremendous depth and nuance to the academic understanding of Assyrian history and culture. The existence and accessibility of this rich repertoire of sources available from first millennium Assyria distinguishes it from Babylonia and Egypt, both of which similarly developed into large imperial states. These sources enable an investigation into the deep history of Assyrian culture and tradition and permit a renewed exploration of the “mechanics” of the origin and development of an ideological discourse that would inform the operation of an empire. Although sources for Assyrian history are not nearly as diverse or rich for the third and second millennia, the aim of this book is to go back in time and contextualize the development of Neo-Assyrian ideology from its origins in the earliest days of Aššur. Simultaneously, this book seeks to document the enormity of Assyria’s cultural interaction over space and time with “outside groups”. Instead of exclusively analyzing the imperial discourse of the first millennium BCE – an approach chosen by most scholars, including Mario Liverani,52 Hayim Tadmor,53 Steven Holloway,54 Mario Fales,55 and Stefan M. Maul56 – the goal here is to trace Assyrian ideology in its formative stages and to expose the emergence of certain tropes during the early history of Aššur. In other words, my primary interest lies in the development of Assyrian ideological discourse against the backdrop of changing political-historical conditions. Running an empire is a collaborative enterprise, and in Assyria “the emperor was obviously assisted by a large number of officials and courtiers, competent in (and entrusted with) various specific functions: scribes and administrators, astrologers and magicians, servants and body guards.”57 In addition to the operative and executive aspects of monarchical power, control of a large

territorial state required an ideological system that anchored the monarchy in established ideational frameworks and religious traditions. The formulation and promulgation of such an ideology was an act of agency. A further objective of this book, therefore, is to reveal the voice of the ancient scholars and to demonstrate their agency in the shaping of the image of the king in the surviving sources, even if the scholars as individuals remain lost to us. In scholarship to date, royal ideological discourse has often been dismissed as straightforward propaganda more or less disconnected from the religious systems with which it was in dialogue. Since its introduction by Sir James Frazer in his monumental work The Golden Bough (1890‒1900), discussion of the idea of divine kingship has been taken up by René Labat in Le caractère religieux de la royauté Assyro-Babylonienne (1939), Ivan Engnell in Studies in Divine Kingship in the Ancient Near East (1943), and Cyril J. Gadd in Ideas of Divine Rule in the Ancient Near East (1948). The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay of Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near East (1948), a collaborative work by Henri Frankfort, Thorkild Jacobsen, and John A. Wilson, was a key element of the postwar discourse on myth and ancient thought. This work, based on a discussion of ancient mythological and religious texts, sought to define the divide between ancient pre-scientific thought, lacking the capacity for abstraction, and modern philosophy and science. Henri Frankfort’s monograph Kingship and the Gods (1948) grew directly out of this collaboration; although it rejected the universalistic approach of Sir James Frazer, it nevertheless adhered to the socio-cultural evolutionism and scientism of this period. Motivated by a critical attitude toward the modern category of “divine” or “sacred” kingship, the present book embarks on an in-depth examination of the regional and temporal aspects of Assyrian cultural discourse and of the many cultural strategies used to sacralize kingship in Assyria. To some degree I am working with the same data that was available to René Labat, Ivan Engnell, and Henri Frankfort. Rather than operating with the notion of divine kingship introduced by Sir James Frazer, my approach does not begin from the question of whether the king should be considered a god but assumes instead the fluid notion of the divine58 and examines strategies for sacralizing kingship, among them ritual, image, and narratives of power. Following Frankfort’s work the study of kingship ceased for several decades, to be revived only in recent years, as is demonstrated by the organiza

14 Introduction
tion of several conferences dedicated to the subject.59 Even in more recent investigations relatively little attention has been directed at the dynamics of regional traditions and their impact on the conceptualization of monarchy.60 Assyrian culture has for a long time been regarded as a “barbarian ‘parasite,’” feeding off of Babylonian traditions. This is despite the fact that already in the 1980s Peter Machinist emphasized the particularities of Assyrian culture and allowed Assyria to speak with its own voice.61 Machinist’s analysis of the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic focuses primarily on the interpenetration of Assyrian and Babylonian culture, observing astutely that Sumero-Babylonian traditions were woven into the epic.62 One goal of this book is to delve further into the SumeroBabylonian-Assyrian dialogue and, simultaneously, to broaden the element of cultural interaction by viewing the development of Assyrian royal ideology in light of Assyria’s interaction with Sumero-Babylonian tradition in the south and Hurrian-Hittite traditions in Syria and Anatolia in the west and north. I am, moreover, particularly interested in the origins of Assyrian ideology, as I am persuaded that we can only fully appreciate the ideological discourse of the Sargonid kings if we are aware of the rich tapestry of traditions their scholars drew upon. My aim, therefore, is to trace the development of Assyrian ideological discourse from the end of the third millennium through to the NeoAssyrian period. An investigation of the material and ideological conditions that determine cosmology, weltanschauung, and the shaping of kingship cannot neglect the underlying social apparatus. As mapped out above, Assyrian cultural discourse was largely the product of an increasingly professional body of scholarly experts.63 The thread running through this book is the cooperation between the intellectual and political elites and the king, framing his political action and shaping his public body politic. This cooperation determined how kingship made use of tradition in its ideological discourse to establish itself as the

guardian of cosmic order and how particular historical circumstances shaped ideological discourse. Accordingly, this book deals with the dynamic and asymmetrical relationships between king and religious elites as they were enacted by means of narratives of power, divination, and ritual performance. Throughout this book I will discuss a broad array of literary sources and annalistic literature, which established what I call the chaîne opératoire of the ideal royal action (see especially Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight). This discussion is very much dominated by the notion of myth as an analytical tool rather than a state of mind, and so again my approach differs decisively from that of the Frankfort School. Issues of intertextuality and fictionality and how historiographic and literary texts inform each other with regard to their emplotment and message are equally discussed in these chapters and additionally in Chapter Nine. Ritual was a potent means of maintaining the balance of power between temple and palace and will be investigated in depth in Chapter Ten. Narratives of power and ritual served to anchor kingship in the mythical past and were essential strategies for sacralizing kingship. Because ritual and narratives of power were informed by and made use of myth and weltanschauung, they adapted perpetually to changing political landscapes. Kingship in turn functioned both as the stimulus for the production of knowledge and cosmologies, as well as their crystallized expression. As such, considering myth, ritual, and kingship together is crucial to understanding the social efficacy of myth. This book does not regard tradition as a monolithic body of knowledge. Instead, it focuses on the mobilization of multiple strategies and the agency behind them in order to explore the dynamics of “re-invented tradition” in ever-changing historical circumstances. Political agency, too, cannot be explained exclusively as the product of social function or individual motivations, but is to be understood as the outcome of a certain weltanschauung, which in antiquity was often expressed in mythic patterns of explanation, interpretation and orientation.64 By taking into consideration the dynamic interaction between religious and ideological concepts and societal organization in their historical dimensions, this book attempts to bridge the modern division between religion and politics. For this study, religious systems are not understood as purely symbolic systems representing a “real” world outside of religion, and neither is myth categorized simply as the condensed iteration of religious systems. The assumption here is that cosmogonies and myths at large not only create their own versions of the world – versions that change depending on context or text genre – but that

16 Introduction
they also have a strong impact on the political action of elites and on their ideological discourse. Conversely, while the weltanschauung expressed in myth can inform political action, ideological innovation tends to follow rather than precede expansionist ambitions and new conquests. In other words, religion is considered the “privileged transcendent system of culture that encompassed, structured, disciplined, and permeated all” other systems – politics, economy, arts, etc. – so that “none of them can be understood as secular in the modern sense.”65 I will return to the relationship between religion, tradition, and ideology at the end of this chapter. Tukultī-Ninurta I’s axiom that “peace cannot be made without conflict,”66 a principle governing combat myths generally and informing the Assyrian royal inscriptions, determines the starting point for approaching the question of cosmology and politics in Assyria more broadly.67 At stake were the dynamics between cosmic order (kittu) and kratogenic chaos, constantly threatening to destabilize and destroy civilization as embodied by the city.68 Although in mythological narrative cosmic order was in the first instance established by means of combat and the triumph of the warrior god, in reality it had to be perpetually effectuated by the king through his administration of justice (mīšaru), i.e. securing civic order within the community, and through achieving concord (mitgurtu) and peace (salīmu) with the enemy,69 i.e. mitigating the harmful

The textual tradition of that region does not reflect a primary concern to learn about or depict the cosmos for the sake only of knowing or explaining its origins. Instead, cosmogonies function as analogies and etiologies for a particular plot, figure or the purpose of a specific text and ritual. As such, they have their place as prologues to larger poems and songs revolving around specific heroes or tools, as well as to dialogues, songs, and omen series. Furthermore, they play a major role in building rituals (Ambos 2004) and healing rituals meant to reestablish a primordial state of perfection. Moreover, cosmogonic concepts in abbreviated forms inform the ceremonial names of temples and palaces, royal titulary, historical narratives, state ritual, and iconography, and as such provide the key metaphor and conceptual framework for change and innovation (For the transformative effect of ritual see Turner 1967; Bell 1992, 184). 68 Karen Sonik in press, alters the terminology used by Jan Assmann 2003, 189 to describe the distinction between cosmogonic chaos as primeval amorphous state from which sprang the order of creation and cratogony, i.e. the establishment of rule to kratogenic carrying the notion of consolidation and stability as housed within the city shifting the emphasis on the dynamics of civilization. 69 Cancik-Kirschbaum 1997.



Fascination with the Assyrian Kings 17
forces of disorder and confusion that existed within the organized universe but outside of the city and territory controlled by the king. Toward the end of the Sargonid period, the king Esarhaddon (680‒669 BCE) explicitly evokes the indivisible relationship between royal agency and cosmic order by mapping his kingship into the regular paths of the celestial bodies in the heavens:
they (the gods) [named] me [for shepherd]ing the land and the people. In [order] to give the land and the people verdicts of truth and justice, the gods [Sîn and] Šamaš, the twin gods, took the road of truth and justice monthly.70
1.3 Fascination with the Assyrian Kings
Despite regional and temporal variations and differences, there always existed in Mesopotamia a system of beliefs and symbols aimed at cultural cohesion. In building their empire, the Assyrian kings drew on the diversity of cultural traditions by which they were surrounded and perfected an ideological system creating a sense of cultural cohesion, even though this sometimes developed differently at the local level. The Assyrian emphasis on cultural integration to construct a unified political community out of a rapidly expanding heterogeneous multilingual and multiethnic population – an integration enforced in part by their massive deportation politics – is what distinguished them from the Babylonians, who from the beginning comprised a conglomeration of city states. In the long history of the ancient Near East, the Assyrians stand out in their endeavor to create a coherent political and ideological system capable of transforming the intercultural heterogeneous landscape into a homogeneous intra-cultural empire dominated by a shared symbolic system. Well aware of the dynamics of conflict between the centralized court and other sectors of society, and the fragility of power relationships in the making and remaking of their political landscape, the Assyrians strove to create a communal sense based on key-metaphors which were evoked throughout the territory of their empire. These key-metaphors served the respective political elites in their “conversation” with the center. In contrast to the various unified polities in Babylonia, which comprised several formerly independent city states, Assyria grew out of the single city state of Aššur. Given that the name of the city and its chief god are identical, this historical process “marks the native understanding of the land as the ex

tension of the city and the god.”71 Essential to the Assyrian imperial ideology, consequently, is that the city of Aššur and her patron deity, i.e., the original political and cultic center, function as a cipher for the center of the empire regardless of the location of the royal residences, which changed over time. At various times, however, this core concept was challenged. This is particularly clear in the cases of Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta and Khorsabad, the newly-constructed residences of Tukultī-Ninurta I and Sargon II (722‒705 BCE) respectively, and in the reaction of the professional elites in Aššur, who were closely linked with the Aššur temple, to the building of these cities. Despite such occasional tensions, the scholars of Aššur were deeply involved in the organization of the state cult and in mapping the king’s image onto the mind of the people, and they managed to monopolize Aššur’s role as the cultural metropolis of Assyria. It is through their eyes that we have to read Assyrian ideological discourse. In light of the idea that the dynamic growth of the Assyrian polity mirrored the spread of the god Aššur’s divine presence, the state of Assyria defined itself in relation to what lay beyond. The Assyrian kings considered it their primary duty to constantly push Assyria’s frontiers towards the unknown. The royal inscriptions in particular extol the king’s transformative ability to integrate the world of disorder, – i.e. the non-Assyrian world – into the world of order, and to make it a cohesive part of Assyria. As will be discussed in Chapter Six, royal inscriptions are to be read as variations on the plotline of the narratives revolving around the warrior god Ninurta. Royal titulary reflects the kings’ efforts to ensure correspondence between their controlled territory and cosmic dimensions, and thus to live up to the divine command to expand Aššur’s territory. This claim is expressed in titles such as ‘king of totality’ (šar kiššati), ‘king of the four banks (= corners of the world)’ (šar kibrāt arba’i) and ‘who exercises authority over the four banks from the rising to the setting sun,’ (šarru ša ultu ṣītān adi šillān kibrāt arba’i ibêluma).72 These titles, as will be shown in Chapter Four, were not unique to Assyria, but reach far back to the beginnings of political attempts at unification in Mesopotamia and changed their meaning over time. In addition to the mythic discourse behind political agency, the deliberate construction of the imperial space was instrumental in producing power, authority, and legitimacy.73 The Assyrian kings developed multiple strategies for fostering an “enduring perception of geopolitical relationships”74 as performed

in spatial practice, and for creating places that drew together the communities of their empire into a single imagined civil community. These included the following material, cultic and ideological strategies, most of which are attested only during the Neo-Assyrian period: 1. The establishment of a network of communication and road systems designed to facilitate exchange of information throughout the empire.75 This vast road system represented “the logistical strength and organizational power of the empire.”76 2. The implementation of massive hydraulic projects enabling the secure irrigation of vast regions in a dry-farming area. This demonstrated the effectiveness and technological transformative power of rulership and concomitantly displayed the king’s ability to maintain the divinely envisioned world order. 3. The construction of an urban fabric that fostered a close proximity between the palace and the temples, with residential quarters of high officials adjacent to the citadel, segregated by fortified walls from the rest of the walled city. 4. The implementation of an Assyrian style in the institutional architecture of the provincial capitals, thereby endowing political space with new meaning. 5. The erection of steles at the gates of conquered cities in the periphery in order to evoke the constant presence of the Assyrian king in the company of the Assyrian gods; the carving of rock reliefs served the same purpose of manifesting a constant Assyrian presence.77 6. The strengthening of the position of the Aššur temple as the religious center of the empire. This was achieved through the establishment of a system of regular deliveries to the Aššur temple providing for the daily offerings to the god Aššur. These deliveries were contributed “in a fixed rota”78 by the various provinces of Assyria,79 and the economic relationship they produced between Assyria’s cultic center and the provinces was vital to fostering the experience of political belonging and obedience to Aššur, the supreme god of the Assyrians.80 7.

8. The renaming of conquered provincial centers with Assyrian toponyms.81 9. The setting up of the weapon of Aššur for the performance of the loyalty oath.82 10. The development of a network of communication with the gods through divinatory experts who reported to the center from all ends of the empire.83 11. The elaboration of state rituals in the imperial center that not only required the presence of the king but turned him into an active agent through his assumption of the role of the chief priest (šangû) of the god Aššur.
These cultural strategies were effective displays of royal power, anchored in the weltanschauung and responding to the cultural imagination of the time at large. While the economic measures taken to bind the Assyrian provinces to the Aššur temple were imposed throughout the empire, other strategies differed in the extent to which they were applied in the territory of the empire, as demonstrated in some instances below. Continuous exposure to representations of Assyrian ideology and Assyrian administrative measures had a profound effect on the attitude of the people in the provinces and beyond, as is apparent in the emulation by local elites of the Assyrian style of living. Through exposure to the spatial practices mentioned above, they were supposed to adopt an identity that was predicated upon faith in the universality of Aššur.84 Institutionalizing Aššur as the common point of reference for all of the empire’s subjects was thus intended to generate a sense of absolute loyalty to the god and served as a vehicle for political loyalty to the king. This loyalty, however, did not include religious conversion85 or the abandonment of the personal god. The measures undertaken by Assyrian rulers in order to reinforce their centralized control were numerous and wide-ranging. Their mere existence reflects

In six cases the installation of the weapon follows the transformation of a city into a provincial capital. In most cases the weapon of Aššur was raised at the extreme limits of the Assyrian provincial network, in Babylonia, Urartu, and Media and in bordering regions such as Cilicia and southern Philistine. Very often the setting up of divine symbol and royal image was accompanied by resettlements of foreign groups in the city or provincial regions, see Holloway 2002 163. 83 Pongratz-Leisten 1999. 84 Ando 2000, 41 describes similar strategies for sustaining the Roman empire. 85 For diverging views in this debate see McKay 1973; Cogan 1974; Spieckermann 1982; Cogan 1993; Machinist 2003.

the fragility of monarchic power in Assyria and calls for a re-evaluation of the operation of the Assyrian empire which, from my point of view, was able to function only because of the cooperation and collusion between the ruler and political and scholarly elites. While recent research has been very successful in shedding light on the political and economic aspects of the operation of the Assyrian empire, this book aims at delineating the cultural and religious strategies that allowed it to function.
1.4 Tradition, Cultural Discourse, and Ideology: How They Intertwine
Let me begin by clarifying what I mean by the terms ‘tradition,’ ‘cultural discourse,’ and ‘ideology,’ as well as why and how I will use them throughout the book. Over time, scholarship has developed various labels for cultural knowledge, among them tradition,86 cultural discourse87 and, more narrowly, cultural repertoire.88 I myself consider tradition the growing body of cultural memory, which is informed by social values and practices.89 This cultural legacy materializes in cultural discourse, which is constantly reformulated and reconceptualized in all media including myth and historiography, as well as in architecture, iconography, and ritual. My understanding of cultural discourse includes all media of expression – image, text, and ritual. Moreover, the dynamics of the agency producing the media is just as important as the communication between authors and audience, both of whom participate in the production of culture and together constitute a discourse community.90 In other words, tradition is the coherent body of the inherited cultural legacy “that transcended political fragmentation, and cut through various divisions, including linguistic diversity, to unify scribal intellectual worldviews in much of the Near East,”91 while cultural discourse is the constant reformulation and re-conceptualization of tradition, as enacted by the ancient scholars in the entourage of the king and in the organization of local, regional, and supra-regional cults. Royal ideology then can be considered a subcategory of cultural discourse, namely the condensed form of the royal perspective, including all of

22 Introduction
its conceptual innovations, which is constantly worked into the traditional framework. Mesopotamian tradition has often been described as conservative and static in nature, striving to maintain the status quo. This characterization has been enhanced by the debate on pre-axial and axial civilizations, most recently promoted by S. N. Eisenstadt.92 The dichotomy between traditional/premodern societies as “closed types” and modern societies as “culturally dynamic, oriented to change and innovation” very much informed the work of the founding fathers of sociology such as de Tocqueville, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and others.93 They tended to overlook the dynamics and tension between tradition and cultural discourse, which were constantly transformed in response to actual historical circumstances. In the case of Mesopotamia in particular, the notion of world-historical transformations and innovations restricted to the period between the eighth and third centuries BCE remains unconvincing. Even the most cursory investigation of the intertwining of religion and ideology in Mesopotamia reveals that the early civilizations of the alluvial plain, due to their geographical exposure to the northern and eastern mountains, the western steppes and desert, and, further to the west and the south, the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, perpetually encountered new cultural and ethnic elements. The ensuing cultural interaction entailed the constant adaptation and transformation of new ideas and cultural practices, which in turn promoted the perpetual re-invention of tradition. It has been suggested that major breaks in the written tradition can be observed during the second millennium with the restructuring of the “received canon,” resulting in the discontinuation of entire categories of texts and a changed balance in favor of completely new cultural schemes.94 The multi-ethnic and multi-lingual components of Mesopotamian culture cannot be stressed enough, as “what we so glibly call ‘Mesopotamian Civilization,’ is in reality, a convenient conceptual bricolage of many different cultural features, spread out over millennia in generally the same geographical space. This long, extremely complex occupational sequence is full of political and cultural breaks, discontinuities, local variation, and with its own visionary as well as revivalist movements.”95 Geographic and ethnic terms, therefore, can only serve as auxiliary devices to the modern scholar. The expression of cultural texts in a particular language and the use of particular tropes at particular moments in time should be understood as a cultural choice

determined by local or regional scribal practices and prevailing modes of scholarly production, all of which took place in an atmosphere of perpetual and vivid exchange. Notwithstanding these local and regional dynamics, royal ideology was surprisingly consistent with regard to the set of tropes and key metaphors it utilized to fashion a royal image that supported the claim of a particular king to be the equal of his peers on the international scene. While this set of tropes emerged very early in Mesopotamian history, local and regional choices expressing a preference for certain tropes over others were conditioned by specific historical circumstances. The kings of the Ur III period, for example, stressed their connection to Gilgameš, Lugalbanda and Ninsun, all at home in Uruk, which was not coincidentally the city from which the Ur III kings hailed.96 This Ur III ideology, however, interestingly did not make its way into Assyrian discourse which chose to rely on traditions of the kings of Akkad instead. Central to the correct understanding of ideology is the fact that, in antiquity, tradition and weltanschauung were entirely dominated and permeated by religion. Ancient Near Eastern scholarship has tended to view religion as “one cultural system among others (politics, economy, literature, art, philosophy, fashion etc.), all of which enjoy relative independence,”97 rather than regarding religion as the meta-discourse encompassing, structuring, and permeating all others, ideology included. Archaeologists have also used the term ideology “as a substitute for ‘world view’, ‘religion’ or ‘political doctrine,’”98 thus missing the opportunity to disentangle the various ways in which ritual, political discourse, and visual media were informed by ideology, which again had to respond to the religious weltanschauung. Last but not least, ideology has been considered primarily in Marxist terms and understood as a strategy deployed by political elites to influence social behavior,99 to disguise social and economic stratification,100 and to serve the integration of different social groups (classes, genders, professions, lineages, etc.) involved in power struggles.101 There has thus been a “risk of reducing ideology to an unwieldy dichotomy between domination and resistance,102 pigeonholing it in its worst two-dimensional

form.”103 As a result, adaptation, refocusing, and selective representation in the ideological discourse have frequently been classified as a misrepresentation of events and conditions,104 marking ideological discourse as a whole as ‘untrue’ since it suppresses certain motives and interests to justify certain societal conditions. Myth, however, constitutes an integral part of the religious weltanschauung and informs ideology in ancient societies, where it has “the cultural status of truth in the society or groups to which they belong.”105 As has been shown by Hans Blumenberg in his monumental Work on Myth,106 this applies equally to modern societies despite the advance of secular, scientific rationality. Regarded by its audiences as truthful and meaningful, myth represents what Eliade called the exemplar history and is sufficiently authoritative to have paradigmatic value as “simultaneously a ‘model of’ and a ‘model for’ reality.”107 Antonio Gramsci was among the first to suggest that ruling classes do not only rule “through force and the threat of force but because their ideas have come to be accepted by the ‘subordinate classes.’”108 In his discussion of the Karatepe and Çineköy inscriptions, Giovanni Lanfranchi argued persuasively that even the elites of tributary states could be staunch supporters of the Assyrian empire, as they enjoyed material benefits stemming from their position in the Assyrian imperial circuit.109 Consent to Assyrian overlordship could also be expressed from within, by local rulers themselves. Some of these rulers exalted overtly their alliance with Assyria, as did Bar-rakib of Sam’al, who proudly declares to have “run at the wheel” of the Assyrian king, thereby following in the footsteps of his father – also an erstwhile ally of the Assyrian king.110 Furthermore, rulership has always been sanctified and presented in accordance with the religious weltanschauung. Only upon the disintegration of the medieval weltanschauung and its attendant institutions did ideology become an object of political debate and philosophical critique.111 Ideology was a central element of the cultural discourse, and it also functioned as an effective source of power (rather than solely as a source of authori

ty) along with economic, political, and military sources.112 Nevertheless, because of the fact that religion permeated all of these sources of power in antiquity, ideology cannot be understood merely through its function in daily practice as a regulator and harmonizer of societal actions.113 Instead, in an “ongoing arena for competition, control of meaning, and the negotiation of power relationships,”114 ideology – as it materializes in state ceremonies, ritual, monuments, architecture, iconography, and all kinds of textual categories such as treaties, royal inscriptions, chronicles, and myths – strives equally to respond to and negotiate the religious weltanschauung, which prescribes a particular function and meaning for the institution of kingship in the cosmic order. When defining his notion of the “stream of tradition,” Leo Oppenheim had the textual evidence of the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian libraries in mind. These libraries demonstrate a striking conservatism in the transmission of texts such as omen compendia and certain literary texts that originated in the Sumero-Babylonian tradition. Oppenheim assumed this apparent conservatism to be a consequence of “the desire to preserve a body of religious writings, or the wish to sustain one tradition against the opposition of, or in competition with, rival traditions.”115 Oppenheim also stressed the point that in Mesopotamia it was “considered an essential part of the training of each scribe to copy faithfully the texts that made up the stream of tradition.”116 As has been noted by Michalowski,117 this purely operative aspect of scribal training implied that the scribal elites were educated in the stream of tradition, and so could serve the king in his endeavor to represent himself as the rightful occupant of the throne. The “relationship between texts, ideology, and political control”118 is crucial to our understanding of the collaboration between scholars and the king: it reveals the authoritative voice of the former in the articulation of independent visions of social realities in literary compositions not commissioned by the court. Eventually, many of these compositions would be emulated in royal discourse. As such, they serve to illustrate the dynamic interaction between established tradition and cultural discourse on the one hand and the ideological interests of kings at particular historical moments on the other. In this context,

26 Introduction
it is again interesting to observe that the tradition revolving around the kings of Akkad seems to have had a much wider dissemination into the north and the west than the tradition revolving around Gilgamesh. Oppenheim’s notion of the stream of tradition has recently come under attack. Eleanor Robson has argued strongly against Oppenheim’s homogeneous notion of tradition, referring to mathematical texts and discontinuity in the use of certain omina series.119 Similar reservations have been advanced by Niek Veldhuis in his discussion of the transmission of lexical texts, where he has stated that Oppenheim’s metaphor of a “stream of tradition” “views the tradition as something more or less independent and with a power of its own”120 and conceals local variations. It seems to me, however, that Oppenheim had something different in mind, focusing much more on ideological preferences and the manner in which texts were created in the service of the court, be it in response to political events or as possible patterns of explanation and orientation, which might be appropriated only much later in time by some ideological discourse:
When Assyriologists will be able to follow the fate of individual text groups through the history of their tradition, they will obtain more insights into the workings of this ‘stream’ and, conceivably, light will be shed some day on the ideological preferences and other attitudes that neither the content nor the wording of these texts is likely to reflect directly.121
As noted by Jerrold Cooper, many Sumerian myths and epics – among them the narratives revolving around the legendary kings Enmerkar and Lugalbanda – did not survive the extensive recreation or re-invention of cultural discourse during the Old Babylonian period, while others such as Angimdimma and Lugal-e did. In addition to the discontinuation of certain texts, there was also the creation of new Sumerian works and the frequent addition of Akkadian translations,122 although this process in its standardized form was only established during the Late Bronze Age as attested by the rich evidence of the libraries from Aššur, Emar, Nuzi, Boghazköy, Ugarit and Alalakh. There is clearly an intertextual relationship between Sumero-Babylonian and Assyrian chronographic texts.123 Moreover, the Assyrian lexical (i.e. educational) and divinatory corpus is indebted to the Babylonian tradition, and Assyrian literary

texts reveal signs of Sumero-Babylonian influence. Nevertheless, Assyrian textual production – particularly royal inscriptions and scholarly texts such as the earliest version of Astrolabe B124 – remains quite distinct, demonstrating an increasing professionalism of local scribes and scholars beginning in the Middle Assyrian period if not earlier. This Assyrian acquisition of expertise in turn played into scribal training at cities such as Emar125 and Ugarit,126 attesting to an additional, indirect avenue of transmission of Babylonian knowledge and culture beyond a direct importation from Babylonia into Syria and Anatolia. The various avenues of transmission of Sumero-Babylonian knowledge, as well as local continuities and discontinuities in the process of its adaptation, are, however, only one aspect. The other aspect, of particular importance in this book, is Jerrold Cooper’s notion of textual communities defined by and through a corpus of shared texts.127 This notion encapsulates perfectly the pervasive influence of scribal and scholarly agency in shaping cultural identity and maintaining cultural stability. It accounts for the perseverance of the tropes and imagery of combat myth narratives like Lugal-e, Angimdimma, and the Anzû Myth, the survival of the ideology of Sargonic Akkad in the cultural memory as expressed in omen compendia and later royal discourse in the Tigridian region, and the inclination of scholars toward intertextuality in the creation of new texts. To return to our definition of ideology, it is precisely the perpetual efforts of individual kings in the ancient Near East to demonstrate their fulfillment of the expectations of kingship that constituted the primary motivation for the formulation of the rhetoric of all materialized forms of ideology, be they textual, iconographic, monumental, or ritual. In this endeavor the ruler was guided by his scholars, who, as is becoming ever clearer from their libraries, represented the hidden voice128 in the creation of the king’s authority. Although I subscribe to the view that there was no geographically and diachronically unified way that power was structured and organized in Mesopotamia,129 I still maintain that there was an overarching ideological conceptualization of rulership.

28 Introduction
Similarly, while ideological expression in Northern Syria and Assyria differed to a large degree from that of Sumer and Babylonia, these dissimilarities can be traced to different choices regarding the use of key metaphors from the cultural repertoire that had developed since the fourth millennium BCE. This process was already recognized by Hayim Tadmor in the 1970s130 and dominated his subsequent analyses of royal inscriptions.131 In this he was followed by Liverani, who in his seminal article on “The Ideology of the Assyrian Empire”132 expanded the discussion to include space, time, diversity of men, and diversity of goods, aspects that he discussed in detail in his monograph Prestige and Interest. Despite the important contributions of both of these scholars, numerous Assyriologists continue to read the royal inscriptions principally as a source for the reconstruction of an histoire événementielle,133 the illumination of the dynamics of imperial expansion,134 and the exposition of the operational aspects of the exercise of imperial power.135 The fact that the expansionist ambitions of the Assyrian empire and its artistic and architectural display have been at the center of scholarly interests136 is largely based on modern scholarship’s understanding of ideology as a means for reinforcing social hierarchies and norms and legitimizing economic stratification. This book aims to tell a different story. The focus here is on the king’s use of tradition in his effort to establish his authority and realize his desire to be recognized as legitimate by the elites, the gods, and posterity, as well as by his peers in the international arena. Accordingly, instead of focusing on the topdown effect of ideology, the goal of this book is to shed light on the intellectual efforts of the king’s scholars over centuries of Assyrian history to harmonize tradition and ideology while meeting the historical challenges faced by particular kings. In his discussion of first millennium Assyrian imperialist ideology, Mario Liverani emphasizes the fact that religion represents the code underpinning ideology. Liverani is correct to state that religion should not be considered an additional ideological element in its own right because the supreme god Aššur is the hypostasis of Assyrian kingship,137 but this view applies only to the
130 Tadmor 1977; later Hayim Tadmor 1997 even argued for legitimately using the term “propaganda,” and while I follow him in the several steps of his argument, I still consider the term distortive and will avoid it throughout the book. 131 Tadmor 1983; 1997. 132 Liverani 1979. 133 Mayer 1995. 134 Lamprichs 1995; Parker 2001; Yamada 2000. 135 Holloway 2002. 136 Reade 1979a, 1979b. 1980; Russell 1987, 1991, 1999; Winter 1981; 1983; 1997. 137 Liverani 1979, 301.

imperial claim of the Assyrian kings as visualized during ritual performances in which the king wore the god Aššur’s tiara.138 Liverani’s position does not, however, apply to the ideology dominating the operational and executive aspects of royal agency, which, as I will discuss in this book, is informed above all by the Ninurta mythology. Assyrian cultural discourse can also not be categorized simply as a Mesopotamian tradition, since Assyria emerges as a distinctive cultural zone in its interaction with Syrian and Anatolian cultures alike. Locating the various strands of tradition in Assyrian cultural discourse while simultaneously demonstrating Assyria’s creative power and highly selective formulation of its royal ideology was one of the major challenges of writing this book. Documenting Assyria’s construction of its own cultural heritage was further complicated by Assyria’s frequent exposure to or provocation of migrations and its continuous cultural interaction with other regions through conquest, trade, and diplomacy. Assyria’s geography plays a key role in Assyria’s many cross-cultural interactions, as the city of Aššur began its existence as a hub between east and west, north and south, with an economic interest in monopolizing interregional exchanges.139 Last but not least, it is necessary to comment on the use of the terms “imperial” and “empire.” Assyriologists and non-specialists generally work with a notion of the ‘classical’ empires of Assyria, Babylonia, and Persia that ties the idea of empire to a compactness of hegemonic control over a large part of the ancient Near East as occurred during the first millennium BCE. In response to the broadening of the term “empire” to include polities such as the empire of Akkad and the Hittite empire, which do not in fact meet the requirement of vast territorial control but were administratively decentralized or lacked an imperial ideology, Mario Liverani suggests that the term be limited to the Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Achaemenid polities, “reverting in fact to the ‘classical’ list as already defined by the ancient (biblical and Classical) authors.”140 Liverani covers many of the key characteristics of empire, such as the development of an expansive and substantial road system with its progressive establishment of a network of communication, centralized economic and administrative systems, extensive military capabilities, and the visual materialization of centralized power in the royal residences through architecture and state ceremonies. Beyond these conventional criteria, Liverani repeatedly stresses the importance of imperial ideology, since “the very same definition of an empire is not

30 Introduction
so much related to the size of the imperial state (which, as we have seen, can be quite small, if projected to a world scale), but to the ideological pretension of universal domain.”141 As imperial claims, however, both the pretension to universal dominion and the notion of hegemonic control over the entire known oikoumene were already familiar to the kings of Akkad. “What follows in Mesopotamian history,” to quote Jean-Daniel Forest, is “nothing but a lengthy variation around the same theme until the advent of larger empires that went far beyond the Mesopotamian region.”142 It is therefore impossible to distinguish the kings of Akkad from certain Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian kings on the basis of their imperial claims. The fascinating question to pursue is how and at what historical moment the Assyrians created their own imperial language: under which circumstances did Assyrian expansionist politics produce an imperial language with its own particular ideological variations, what were its specific characteristics, and how did Assyrian ideological discourse interact with Assyrian religious tradition on the one hand and with the ideologies of surrounding polities on the other? To answer this question, a distinction will be made between the political entity that constituted the Assyrian “empire” of the first millennium and the “imperial discourse” that informed the expansionist politics of Mesopotamian kings since the Akkad period.
1.5 The Mobility of the Scholars and their Role at the Royal Courts
The materialization of power in luxury goods and monumental architecture as signifiers of status and prestige and as vehicles for the communication of ideological claims addressed to peer polities is clear,143 but this study is primarily text-based. As such, it complements the ground-breaking work of Irene Winter, Zainab Bahrani, and Julian Reade on the ideological elements informing the artistic self-representation of Assyrian and earlier kings.144 Although it is focused on texts – in monumental form, on clay tablets, or as prescriptions for ritual performances – the central aim of this study is to demonstrate that texts were the product of the scholars working in the entourage of the king. Every statement made in a text or performed in ritual regarding the agency of an individual king or the institution of kingship as a whole represents the hid

den voice of these scholars,145 who crafted ideological responses to the circumstances that prevailed at particular historical moments. Texts were circulated widely while scribes and scholars themselves moved over significant distances, resulting in a remarkable mobility of knowledge. This mobility was the foundation not only for intertextual creativity, text critique, commentary, and textual control, but also for the reinvention of the literary tradition centered on the figure of the king, as will be discussed at greater length in Chapter Two. The circulation of texts was further promoted through the acquisition by Assyrian kings of the private reference libraries of scholars in conquered cities, a practice attested as early as the 13th century under Tukultī-Ninurta I, who explicitly refers to the seizure of texts from Babylon in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic.146 Activities of this kind, documented in the Middle Assyrian period for the kings Tukultī-Ninurta I and Tiglath-Pileser I, account for the presence of Babylonian scholars at the Assyrian court and of bilingual SumeroAkkadian copies of Sumerian compositions in Aššur and Nineveh, among them Angimdimma and Lugale. Other Sumerian texts were also known in Assyria, “as is proven by the existence of a monolingual tablet containing a few lines of an Akkadian translation (without the Sumerian original) of the Instructions of Shuruppak, which was found at Aššur ... In fact, the so-called library of Tiglath-Pileser I147 contains at least twenty Sumero-Akkadian bilinguals, including several emesal compositions, and Nineveh has yielded a handful of Sumerian compositions as well.”148 Indeed, the second half of the second millennium BCE sees an internationalization of Akkadian literature, which spread to scribal centers throughout the ancient Near East. Notable examples of this phenomenon are Hattuša in Anatolia, Ugarit and Emar in Syria, and Susa in Elam.149 Scholarly mobility could be driven by a number of factors. Of these, the most important one was the collapse of polities, as this resulted in the disappearance of the palatial institutions that functioned as the larger framework in which scribal culture existed. Whatever the specific reason for the migration of scholars, their preeminent role in the process of state formation is truly striking. By way of illustration, Babylonian scribes worked at the court of Hattuša precisely during the period when Hittite scribal traditions were being shaped around 1600 BCE. At this point the Narām-Sîn Epic, one of the narratives regarding the Old Akkadian kings that emerged during the Old Babylonian peri

od in Mesopotamia, made its way into Anatolia in the form of KBo 19 99.150 The colophon of this tablet is revealing because the text is the product of a scribe who bore an Anatolian name but was nevertheless of Babylonian origin; he chose to name both Babylonian and Hittite deities as the patron deities of his profession as a scholar:

This copy of the Narām-Sîn Epic does not mark the beginning of an independent Hittite tradition of writing and scholarly education, but rather the beginning of an archival tradition in Hattuša. The cuneiform used by the Hittites during the reign of Hattušili I (1580‒1550 BCE) is an Old Babylonian form of writing that is somewhat older than the one used in contemporary Northern Syria, suggesting that initially Hittite kings relied on foreign scribes. Only in the 15th century does a distinctively Hittite scholarly scribal tradition appear in Hattuša.152 The role of the scholars of the Mitanni state continues to be completely unrecoverable in light of the available evidence, and Mitannian administrative achievements are primarily recognizable in the integration of particular terms in the Assyrian language.153 Nonetheless, as I will demonstrate in Chapter 10, Hurrian cultural discourse as transmitted in the Hittite-Hurrian texts excavated in the libraries of Boghazköy informed Assyrian state ritual, testifying yet again to the agency of scholars and scribes in the production and preservation of cultural memory. At the Assyrian court itself, the formative role of Babylonian scholars is first apparent in the time of Aššur-uballiṭ I (1353‒1318 BCE), when we have textual evidence for a Babylonian quarter in Aššur that included a temple of Marduk, and, in ‘its shadow,’ a house owned by the scribe Marduk

nādin-ahhe, son of Marduk-uballiṭ, grandson of Uššur-ana-Marduk.154 This scribal family belonged to a Babylonian scribal house whose members served as high state officials and as administrators of large provinces, exactly the kind of subjects that the ambitious Assyrian kingdom required.155 In Assyria, Marduk-nādin-ahhe was appointed the ‘scribe of the king’ (ṭupšar šarre), a title attested only in the Assyrian capital and only once among the 59 scribes known from the reign of Aššur-uballiṭ. Ninurta-uballissu, ‘scribe of the king’ under Ninurta-apil-ekur (1181‒1169 BCE), trained younger scribes, as is made clear by the colophons of cultural texts such as lexical lists, incantations, and mythological texts which refer to his sons or pupils as young scribes (ṭupšarru ṣeḫru).156 It thus appears that during the Middle Assyrian period the title ‘scribe of the king’ was the predecessor for the title ‘scholar’ (ummânu) of the king, which is attested for the first time under Ašarēd-apil-Ekur (1075‒1074 BCE). Although it is a historiographic text, the Tukultī Ninurta Epic, celebrating the king’s victory over Babylon, mentions collections of tablets brought back from the libraries of Babylonia and thus supports the impression conveyed by the sparse evidence mentioned above for the active building of collections of cultural texts. The first archaeological evidence for such Middle Assyrian libraries stems from various find spots located in the Aššur temple and the Anu-Adad temple.157 Their value as cultural texts is highlighted by the fact that those found in the Aššur temple were mixed with tablets from a Neo-Assyrian library, indicating a clear interest in preserving collections that might originally have been put together by various different experts. The findspot in the Anu-Adad temple yielded a large number of Middle Assyrian lexical texts, regulations regarding palace and harem life, Middle Assyrian laws, royal rituals (among them the coronation ritual), hymns, mythical texts, incantations, medical prescriptions, and texts concerning the treatment of horses, the manufacture of perfumes, mathematics, astronomy, and astrology. “Several of the tablets were written by the brothers Marduk-balāssu-ēriš and Bēl-ahha-iddina from a family of scribes, during the decades before the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I, around the middle of the twelfth century BC.”158 It is not clear whether these tablets originally belonged to various private libraries. Another collection of Middle Assyrian tablets has been unearthed in the western corner of the Old Palace. These tablets are remnants of a library that

34 Introduction
probably belonged to exorcists in the service of the king. They represent five tablets that are all listed in the Exorcist’s Manual, the first millennium curriculum for aspiring exorcists. The famous sage and scholar Esagil-kīn-apli, who served the Babylonian kings Nebuchadnezzar I and Adad-apla-iddina (12th and 11th century BCE respectively), is named in the Exorcist’s Manual as its compiler. Accordingly, the Middle Assyrian texts found in the Middle Assyrian palace speak in favor of dating the origin of the manual back to the end of the second millennium BCE,159 and signal still further the exorcists’ involvement in palatial affairs. To fully understand the role of these intellectuals and experts, it is essential to distinguish between the highly trained scholars whose education encompassed the various disciplines of exorcism, astrology and astronomy,160 the performance of the cult, and extispicy, and whose broad education is evident in their comprehensive private libraries, and the lower-level practitioners of the same disciplines. Leading scholars served as the chiefs (rabi) of different groups of experts employed at the royal court,161 and their libraries indicate systematic research, the compilation of texts, textual production, and the education of apprentice scholars. Modern scholarship should therefore avoid the strict distinction between a “research” and an “educational” milieu. The social role of leading scholars consisted of fashioning a weltanschauung that reinforced societal hierarchies and legitimized royal authority. Upon the perfection of the sciences of divination in the first millennium, “we are dealing with a sophisticated, well organized and comprehensive system of thought that had largely grown out of the necessity to advise and protect the king in his capacity as the god’s earthly representative. It could not have developed as it did without this sort of background.”162 This book will demonstrate
159 Maul 2003, 182; of the five tablets found in the Old Assyrian Palace, the first text seems to have been part of a series with the title “To purify the pen of cows, bulls, sheep and horses,” (Geller 2000, 248 l. 24); the second tablet formed part of the series of the Mouth Washing ritual normally performed on a statue or cultic object dedicated to the cult of a divinity (Geller 2000, 244 l. 11). The third tablet belongs to the “(mourning) of the month Dumuzi” also mentioned in the Exorcist’s Manual (Geller 2000 244 l. 5); the fourth tablet belongs to the Series “To undo a curse” (NAM.ÉRIM.BÚR.RU.DA, Geller 2000, 244 l. 12); and the fifth tablet dealing with dry rot affecting a house belongs to the series of the Namburbi Rituals “warding off an evil” (Geller 2000, 248 l. 29). 160 On the relationship between the two disciplines which in modern times are split into two categories with completely different connotations, one being considered a progressive science, the other as pure superstition, see Parpola 1993a, 47. 161 Parpola 1993a, 52. 162 Parpola 1993a, 56.

that such complexity can indeed be traced back much further in time. Further, it will establish that the great achievement of first millennium Assyrian ideological discourse lies in the sophisticated integration of all media to produce a coherent and persuasive royal image that could be reproduced in any context, where one element of this discourse could trigger the entire narrative of power in the mind of its audience. Within the political, bureaucratic, and religious social strata of ancient Near Eastern society, leading scholars can be regarded as the “intellectuals” of their time; they shaped the weltanschauung and the perception of the king’s body politic, compiled the religious, historical, juridical and lexical knowledge, expounded ritual and religious texts, and determined the thought patterns for the ideological education of the bureaucratic elite. As such, scholars acted not only as the ideological custodians of the central institutions of temple and palace. Rather, by reaffirming, transmitting, and modifying inherited social, cultural, and political traditions, scholars also fulfilled authoritative and powerexercising functions on the higher levels of state administration. They acted as personal agents, counselors, and tutors to the crown prince and king and their advice was sought perpetually in all state affairs. Hence, beyond formulating the ideological basis for royal authority, scholars were also directly involved in the exercise of authority in ways that reached beyond their particular skills and expertise as astrologer, exorcist, and diviner. The sensitive relationship between the king and his scholars is evident in Assyrian royal inscriptions and letters. These shed light on the efforts of kings to maintain absolute superiority in decision-making. Despite the fact that leading scholars acted as personal counselors to the king and were crucial to the ideological operation of empire, even “those lucky scholars ... were by no means freed of economic worries.”163 They were not paid regularly but lived from occasional and regular(?) gifts and the leftovers (rīhātu) of the king’s table. Urad-Gula, for example, started his career as a “deputy of the ‘Chief Physician’ under Sennacherib (..., 681 B.C.), continued as a court exorcist under Esarhaddon (...) but lost his position at court after the accession of Ashurbanipal,”164 as indicated by one of his letters:
13 May the king (=Ashurbanipal),165 my lord heed the case of his servant, let the king see the whole situation! Initially, in (the days of) the king’s father (=Esarhaddon), I was a poor man, son of a poor man, a dead dog, a vile and limited person. He lifted me up from

the dung heap; I got to receive gifts from him, and my name was mentioned among men of good fortune. I used to enjoy generous ‘leftovers’; intermittently, he used to give me a mule [or] an ox, and yearly I earned a mina or two of silver. 19 [In the days] of my lord’s crownprincehood I received ‘leftovers’ with your exorcists; I stood [at] the window openings, keeping watch; all the days that I spent in his service I guarded his privileges, I did not enter the house of a eunuch (lúSAG) or a courtier (ša ziqni = private quarters of the palace) without his permission. I was looked upon as one who eats lion’s morsels, I appeased your god. Now, following his father, the king has added to the good name he had established, but I have not been treated in accordance with my deeds; I have suffered as never before, and given up the ghost. ...
31 If it is befitting that first-ranking scholars and (their) assistants receive mules, (surely) I should be granted one donkey; like[wise], (as) oxen are apportioned in Tebet (X), I too should [...] one ox! 34 Two or three times within a month three to four [... are give]n to [...]; 35 [even ... an ap]prentice [of the] assistant [... ge]ts [.... And] enjoys [a sh]eep [......]; but [me], [what (compensation) do I d]raw, or for what pur[pose do I w]ork?166
Scribal complaints are numerous. Thus the chief diviner complains to the king:
6 The father of the king, my lord, gave me 10 homers of cultivated land in Hallahu. For 14 years I had the usufruct of the land, and nobody disputed it with me. (But) now the governor of Barhalzi has come and mistreated the farmer, plundered his house and appropriated my land. 17 The king, my lord, knows that I am a poor man, that I keep the watch of the king, my lord, and am guilty of no negligence within the palace. Now I have been deprived of my field. I have turned to the king: may the king do me justice, may I not die of hunger!167
Towards the end of the eighth century BCE, the Assyrian palace was the only institution apart from the temples that was able to support scribes on a longterm basis. For this reason, Babylonian scribes are attested either at the Assyrian court or acting on behalf of the Assyrian king in their home towns.168
1.6 The Scholars’ Literary Production at the Assyrian Court
Let us return to the question of innovation and tradition and Assyria’s role in the production of a cultural discourse that was posed at the beginning of this chapter. A key factor for understanding the tension between the two is that scholarly knowledge and texts were understood, like the institution of kingship

itself, to have originated in the divine realm. Any innovation or alteration would thus be perceived as a threat to the cosmic plan originally laid out by the gods. The challenge in writing or reconstructing any cultural history is to delineate and illuminate precisely this tension between a culture’s overt weltanschauung, its actual social-political realization, and the retrospective textualization of the latter. A key point made by Eisenstadt169 is that creativity and innovation within a cultural discourse can only thrive on the foundations of a long-lived tradition. Accordingly, our specific concern with the discourse of royal ideology requires an understanding of the perpetual reconceptualization or reinvention of tradition as “variations upon received themes” rather than as products of originality.170 Tradition accounts for the longevity of certain themes over vast chronological and geographical expanses. In the particular case of Assyrian ideological discourse, tradition also accounts for the fluidity and intertextuality of texts, which resulted in the creation of new text genres revolving around the figure of the king, namely the royal hymns and royal epics of the Middle Assyrian period and the letters of gods and royal reports to Aššur of the Neo-Assyrian period. Idioms in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic reveal not only close intertextual links with the language of treaties and diplomacy, with penitential psalms and laments, with hymns and royal inscriptions, and with heroic tales,171 but also anticipate the major themes of much later Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions. Sargon II’s Eighth Campaign to Urartu “is remarkable for its long, complicated sentences, elaborate style, intricate figures of speech, and its grandiose conception.”172 Both Sargon II’s building account of a palace in his new residence at Khorsabad173 and Sennacherib’s report of the battle at Halule174 draw on the language and imagery of Enūma Eliš and other myths, epics, heroic poems, and former royal inscriptions. The intertextual connections between the Myth of the Creation of Man and God and Ashurbanipal’s Coronation Hymn are evident, while a section of Esarhaddon’s Apology likewise reads as a reformulation of the same myth.175 Although royal inscriptions were concerned primarily with demonstrating that the king had met the expectations of royal office – i.e, that as the steward of the god Aššur the king had secured the social and cosmic

38 Introduction
order and expanded the borders of Assyria – the royal reports to the gods and letter of the gods to the king served to sanctify royal deeds, which involved sacrileges such as fratricide, parricide, and the destruction of the main sanctuary of the enemy.176 Despite their intertextual links with the royal inscriptions, then, royal reports to the gods and letter of the gods to the king must be seen in light of their particular function of sanctifying the king’s deeds. The Sumero-Babylonian impact on Assyrian culture was immense, as is clear from the fact that all official literature was basically written in Babylonian literary dialects and that the Assyrian pantheon was permeated by divinities of Sumero-Babylonian origin. Nevertheless, the Assyrians were self-conscious and creative in their adaptation of Sumero-Babylonian traditions and in their own cultural production. Assyrian particularism is evident in the continuity of certain elements within Assyrian ideological discourse, “despite its various twists and turns.”177 This is especially true with regard to the Assyrian endeavor to exalt Aššur over the Babylonian god Marduk, first as the “Assyrian Enlil” under Tukultī-Ninurta I and then through Aššur’s equation with the ancestor god AN.ŠÁR in the Assyrian version of Enūma Eliš under Sennacherib. Beyond this theological discourse revolving around the supreme divinity of Assyria, the mythology of the warrior god Ninurta and the king’s fulfillment of the role of Ninurta served as the most relevant mythological framework for the royal inscriptions and royal ideology in general (see Chapters Six and Seven). All of these text categories ultimately emphasize divine legitimation and divine support. While the institution of kingship was never questioned, individual monarchs went to great lengths to justify their occupation of the throne.
1.7 Approaches and Method
Inspired by what Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht once called the “presence effects and meaning effects,”178 – i.e. presencing as a practice of producing interpretation and meaning – this book intends to investigate the “materialities of communication”179 in Assyria by considering Assyrian material culture and texts in terms of both their sign value and their practical value in a system of agency.180 While for Gumbrecht the two dimensions of experience and interpretation re

main incongruous, I follow the notion of “experiential realism,” or experientalism as developed in the field of cognitive linguistics.181 In this view, bodily experience has a decisive impact on linguistic encoding and provides the basis for the construction of language.182 From the perspective of cognitive linguistics it is the common experience and the cultural memory of a community that allows for the production of meaning. Accordingly, I explore how religion and weltanschauung translated into the ideological discourse of the Assyrian kings and were mediated in text, image, and ritual. While visual media will occasionally be discussed, the primary focus in this study is on the media of text and ritual and their impact on and negotiation of a complex of meanings that informed Assyrian royal ideology.183 As such, I investigate the ideological strategies for the integration of religious and political elites and their interests and activities into the organizational system of the monarchical power structure. This book does not adhere to or derive from any single “school of thought.” Some major trends have, however, had an impact on my work in recent years. One of these is the attempt of Stephen Greenblatt’s school of New Historicism to regard text in the larger sense of discourse and institutions, rather than distinguishing rigidly between what lies within the text and what lies outside:184 any cultural product, then, is seen as “accumulation, transformation, representation, and communication of social energies and practices.”185 Further, the works of Hayden White,186 Wolfgang Iser,187 Reinhart Koselleck,188 and Jörn Rüsen189 have been crucial for defining my approach to how to read ancient royal discourse in light of the modern truth claim. Their work has also helped clarify for me how ancient royal discourse should be situated within its respective historical context and in relation to the conceptual constructs determined by religion and weltanschauung.190 The works of Hans Blumenberg,191 Walter Burkert,192 and Gerard Genette193 have, in turn, been invaluable

40 Introduction
in the formulation of my thoughts on the intertextual connections between royal inscriptions and mythic texts and heroic poems. Their work has also been useful in establishing that myth should be conceptualized as an analytical category and referential system rather than as a primitive way of thought. Informed by Bruce Lincoln’s definition of religion, this book investigates all four of religion’s domains – discourse, practice, community, and institution194 – and seeks to reveal the dynamics between religion and ideological discourse, between the persistence of tradition on the one hand and innovation or modification in ever-changing circumstances on the other.195 Approaches in cognitive religion196 and in anthropological theory of art197 have also proven fruitful in identifying the character of the agency of the secondary agents of the king.198 These secondary agents, among them the royal insignia, the royal statue, the royal garments, and the divine tiara of Aššur, emerge as extremely powerful agents during ritual performances and in the imagery of royal steles and reliefs, serving to manifest the king’s permanent presence throughout the territories he sought to control. Finally, I must stress that this book, although diachronic in its approach, does not intend to be exhaustive in any way. Rather, the emphasis is on analyzing certain cultural strategies and key metaphors or literary tropes to convey a sense of the malleability, as well as the continuity and discontinuity, of tradition in Mesopotamia in general and Assyria in particular. To that end, this study will exploit every manner of source in order to assess the notion of rulership as it developed over the course of Mesopotamian history and to decode the ideological discourse produced in Assyria during the second and first millennia BCE. Additionally, it is hoped that this book will also sensitize the reader to the fact that our modern periodizations and our thinking in terms of ethnicities and political borders serves to hamper rather than to advance our understanding of the vital moments of change and re-invention of Mesopotamian tradition. Assyria represents an ideal object of study in two respects: 1. for investigating the dynamics between religion, tradition, and ideological discourse, and 2. for exploring the dynamics of ancient Mesopotamian cultural discourse, since Assyria’s constant exposure to surrounding civilizations and to the various cul

tural groups within its territory is evident in every medium of its cultural production. By treating the Sumero-Babylonian and the Syro-Anatolian spheres equally, I will go beyond the concept of a “Greater Mesopotamia” as it has been developed in scholarship to date; so far, modern scholarship has incorporated only the Hābūr triangle and Western Syria into its larger picture.199 However, the royal vision of Assyria shows the impact of a much broader geographic range, entirely consistent with its aspirations to universal rule. It is to this range of cultures and traditions that I now turn.

2 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and
Traditions in Mesopotamia and the Rise
of Assyrian Cultural Discourse
2.1 Preliminary Remarks: Studying Aššur’s Early Beginnings
Reconstituting the weltanschauung of ancient Assyrian monarchy is complicated both by the frustrating shortage of primary sources and by the skeptical attitude of some scholars, who assign great importance to gaps in transmission and to the scarcity of sources allowing direct historical reconstruction. There is certainly a dearth of written sources for the early history of Aššur. Nevertheless, the origins of Assyrian royal ideology can be discerned already in the third millennium on the basis of archaeological evidence from the Early Dynastic period and inscriptions from the ensuing Old Akkadian (ca. 2340‒2120 BCE) and Ur III periods (ca. 2119‒2000 BCE). Consequently, I would like to begin this study by establishing the contours of Assyrian royal discourse as it existed before the Old Babylonian period, i.e. before the reign of Šamšī-Adad I, who is well known for his commemorative inscriptions and building activities in Aššur, and, although not of Assyrian origin, was a pivotal figure in the formulation of the key metaphors of Assyrian royal ideology. Granting Aššur space for a cultural discourse of its own as early as the end of the third millennium BCE requires a substantial rethinking of our paradigms of what the term ‘local’ signifies and what exactly the ‘predominant’ culture of Sumer constitutes. We need to carefully consider the intercultural dynamics that operated between the Upper Tigris and Upper Euphrates regions and southern Mesopotamia,1 including the northern Syrian, Hurrian, Akkadian, and Sumerian traditions. We must be aware that ethno-linguistic terms are of limited value when attempting to define an ideological discourse that was shaped by the presence and under the influence of a multitude of cultures.2 Movement and interaction of peoples along trade routes had shaped the cultures of the ancient Near East for thousands of years before the appearance of written texts. As Gil Stein writes, “of the many trade networks that have so far been traced, the oldest is the so-called Piedmont route, which runs along the foothills of the Zagros and Taurus range and connects Elam with north Syria

Later, the Zagros played a central role in the westward distribution of raw materials such as lapis lazuli and a nickel-rich arsenic copper, which began during the late Ubaid period and peaked during the late Uruk period.”3 It is probably along this trade route that Sumerians and later Hurrians originating in the regions of Armenia infiltrated the alluvial plain of Mesopotamia. Although this route did not directly incorporate the city of Aššur, it did pass through Nineveh. Aššur’s ideological discourse developed in the context of cultural interaction between north and south that dated back at least to the Uruk Period. Archaeological evidence demonstrating the development of organizational structures and ideological elements in the northern regions that were similar to those known from southern Mesopotamia,4 however, underlines the necessity for a reconsideration of “the colonial phenomenon” of the Uruk expansion. This expansion appears to have been more limited than previously thought; it followed the course of the Tigris and the Euphrates and only partially involved the northern region as a whole. Local centers seem to have largely taken over the management of trade by expanding their control over the circulation of primary products towards the end of the Uruk period and in subsequent decades, as demonstrated by evidence from Arslantepe and Tell Brak.5 Consequently, archaeologists have reacted against the Sumerian paradigm, i.e. the view that Sumerian culture was predominant, retaining instead a “neutral attitude vis-à-vis geographical predominance of one area over another.”6 Be that as it may, visual and later textual media demonstrate that essential tropes linked with the office of kingship were developed in the highly stratified and socially diversified society of the ancient city of Uruk during the Uruk IV (3500‒3200) and Djemdat Nasr periods (3200‒2900 BCE). These tropes became the cornerstones of Mesopotamian royal tradition and were reiterated and reformulated in various regions and periods throughout the entire history of the ancient Near East. Further, discoveries regarding the early urban culture of the Hurrians in Urkeš7 – situated at the foothills of the Ṭur-ʿAbdin – point to the existence of yet another cultural horizon, namely that of the Hurrians. Recent excavations

in Urkeš suggest that Hurrian culture co-existed with Sumerian culture while retaining its distinctiveness as a northern urban tradition.8 These excavations also correct the idea that there was a period of ruralization in northern Syria during the second half of the third millennium,9 as the monumental temple terrace in Urkeš can be safely dated to the Uruk period and has much in common with the temple terrace in Tell Huēra.10 During the Akkad period at the latest, the “Khabur triangle was already dotted with Hurrian towns ... and the process of state formation was well under way, while further north, the mineral-rich region of eastern Turkey and southern Armenia (the “Upper Lands”), whence the Hurrians presumably came, was politically more advanced still.”11 By the Ur III period the Hurrian presence extended from the Zagros Mountains through to Ṭur-ʿAbdin, and from Subartu towards Ebla. This presence had a major impact on political and cultural life in the polities of Upper Mesopotamia.12 Eva von Dassow has discussed the phenomenon of “Hurrianization,” i.e. the spread of Hurrian language and Hurrian people in northern Mesopotamia and Syria during the late third and the second Millennium BCE,13 positing that
most likely the land and language were called Ḫurri and ‘Hurrian’ after the self-designation of a population inhabiting that area and speaking that language, though the application of the designation ‘Hurrian’ to people is not attested until the mid-second millennium. In other words, it may be posited that the name Ḫurri (and its derivatives) originated from the designation of a particular group of people, putatively an ethnic group, and that this people’s designation was then applied to their land and language. It does not follow, even if Hurrian did originally denote an ethnic group, that the subsequent spread of the Hurrian language testifies to the multiplication and spread of ethnically Hurrian people. The increase in evidence for the use of Hurrian language, in onomastics, borrowed lexemes in other languages, the writing of texts in Hurrian, and so forth, during the time frame indicated above, may in part be just that, an increase in evidence, while in part it may be attributed to acculturation.14
Although I agree that onomastic choices and the use of a particular language do not necessarily indicate a particular ethnic identity and can instead be at

Preliminary Remarks: Studying Aššur’s Early Beginnings 45
tributed to acculturation, there did exist bureaucratic traditions, myths, and ritual practices that – in addition to being written in Hurrian – are specifically designated as “Hurrian” by other ethnic groups. Hurrian divinities served as carriers of a Hurrian identity, but were also adopted and adapted by Hittite and Assyrian cults. In other words, while any cultural practice can in theory be the product of acculturation, the fact that it is associated with a particular ethnic identity presupposes the existence of such an identity at some point in history. In our particular case, there is a clearly discernible notion of a distinctly Hurrian tradition within the Mesopotamian weltanschauung. Throughout this study I will return to the importance of Hurrian cultural discourse for understanding some of the choices made by Assyrian kings with regard to their presentation of royal ideology through the media of text, image, and ritual. Equally important to cultural developments in the north was the rapid political expansion of the city state of Kīš during the Early Dynastic period I. The notion of a strong ‘Kišite Tradition’ reflecting the political power and cultural importance of Kīš was first advanced by Ignace Gelb15 and has gained further traction on account of an alabaster plaque discussed recently by Piotr Steinkeller.16 This plaque – which clearly has ceremonial purpose – lists large numbers of people of cities that were taken by Kīš in the course of its territorial conquests. These included cities in northern Babylonia, the Diyala region, what later became Assyria, and the trans-Tigridian territories.17 It is still unclear whether Kīš exercised control over all these areas. The numbers are unusually high, and rather than representing a list of prisoners as suggested by Piotr Steinkeller, it could also be one of the first census lists to exercise control over people who could potentially be levied for major irrigation work and building projects. It was during this time that the title ‘King of Kīš’ became so prestigious that it acquired the meaning ‘king of totality.’ During the Early Dynastic period Sumerian cuneiform was adopted by the scribal circles of Kīš, who “modified it quite significantly by introducing new signs and creating new phonetic values. The use of the Kišite cuneiform spread throughout northern Babylonia, eventually reaching Mari, the Hābūr triangle (Tell Beydar), northern Syria (Ebla), and probably many of the places affected by the expansion of Kīš as well.”18 Moreover, in Kīš it is possible to see the development of an economy in which the palace and private households played a dominant role, in contrast to the south where communal temple households were the norm. As Piotr

46 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and Traditions in Mesopotamia
Steinkeller notes, the proto-Akkadian society of Kīš was markedly different from that of its southern counterparts, characterized “by a strong presence of tribal organization and the importance of lineages. In accordance with that, the northern kingship was based on descent, unlike that of southern Babylonia, which was (at least in theory) elective, with the ruler being an earthly representative (vicar) of the deity, who was the real owner and master of the city state.”19 The eastern Tigridian area around Ešnunna is another distinct cultural center important to the development of Assyrian royal ideology. During the Old Akkadian period and afterwards, this region developed its own ideological discourse – one that has much in common with Nineveh and Aššur on the one hand and Lagaš on the other. With regard to the textual evidence, much attention has been paid to the paleographic distinctions that characterize the cuneiform writing system of the eastern Tigridian area and to the use of lexical texts in its scribal curriculum,20 but no such paradigm has yet been formulated for eastern Tigridian cultural discourse. While the city of Ešnunna is generally considered Old Babylonian by Mari specialists,21 use of eastern Tigridian orthography in its texts links the city with the Old Akkadian and Old Assyrian horizons,22 i.e. the northern Mesopotamian sphere. Accordingly, much attention will be paid to Ešnunna’s cultural discourse and to its interaction with Aššur in order to demonstrate the existence of a particular Tigridian discourse that incorporated a combination of Hurrian, Sumero-Babylonian, and northern Akkadian/Assyrian elements. As a first step, I discuss the spread of cuneiform writing and scholarly knowledge from southern Mesopotamia in this chapter, and investigate what the dissemination of cuneiform culture implied for the development of typically northern forms of royal ideology. I will discuss the early development of Aššur’s own ideological discourse in Chapter Three. My ultimate goal is to demonstrate that the cultural discourse developed in the Tigridian and northern Syrian regions emerged in response to the expansionist empire of Akkad. Although this discourse absorbed some elements of imperial Akkadian ideology, it was also formulated and adapted to suit local needs and interests. The tensions outlined here, then, are not merely geographical, dividing between the South and the North, but also cultural, differentiating between use of the cune

iform writing system, the inferred transfer of Sumerian tradition, and indigenous cultural expression.
2.2 North-South Interaction and the Syro-Anatolian Impact on Assyrian Culture
Southern and northern Mesopotamia were closely linked historically through intense intercultural contact that included trade, warfare, diplomatic intermarriage, and mutual assistance in times of trouble. The two regions differed, however, not only in their languages and in the traditions that determined the particular choices they made with regard to their cultural and ideological discourse, but also in their ecological and economic conditions.23 Northern Mesopotamia sits in the eastern part of the ‘Fertile Crescent’ that stretches from Palestine through northern Syria and northern Mesopotamia to south-east Iran, and is thus part of the dry-farming zone. In contrast, the flat alluvial plain of southern Mesopotamia depends on artificial irrigation, which helps account for why settlements first appeared later in the south than in the north. The rise of urban centers in the south emphasized social stratification, labor specialization, and technological innovation in tandem with the invention and development of writing.24 While it is true that in later times certain Assyrian kings made a concerted effort to collect the body of cultural texts from Babylonia and build universal libraries housed in royal palaces,25 Assyrian culture, on both its operational and ideological levels, exhibits a range of strategies that link it as much with the Syro-Anatolian and the eastern Tigridian cultural horizons as with the Sumero-Babylonian tradition of southern Mesopotamia. Cultural interaction between Assyria and the Syro-Anatolian and eastern Tigridian cultural horizons has mainly been investigated with regard to the figurative language of visual images.26 There are nevertheless numerous other instances of common cultural features and practices. The eponym dating system, for instance, was probably introduced to Mari by Šamšī-Adad I following his conquest of Aššur. Like Inanna in southern Mesopotamia, the goddess

48 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and Traditions in Mesopotamia
Ištar-Šauška of Nineveh seems to have fulfilled a key function in the empowerment of the king through the divine world. Ištar-Šauška assumed such a role by the Akkadian period if not earlier, and rose to the top of the Hurrian pantheon at the side of Teššub during the second Millennium BCE, subsequently becoming an essential figure for both Hittite and Neo-Assyrian kingship.27 With regard to royal titulary, the adoption of the title ‘sun’ for the king is particularly interesting. Hitherto considered an adoption from Babylonia, the title was already used by a king from Nagar/Tell Brak in northern Syria following Sargonic control over the region. This early use of the title was probably related to its use by the kings of the Ur III period.28 Still another instance of common cultural practice is the inclusion of natural phenomena as divine witnesses to treaties, a characteristic of supra-regional and international law in the Syro-Anatolian realm that resurfaces in the Assyrian tākultu-ritual.29 Cross-cultural fertilization resulting from interaction between Hurrians, Hittites, and Assyrians is also apparent in a Hittite prayer within a ritual text that is addressed to the goddess Ištar. This prayer invokes Ištar’s hypostases as they exist not only in all the cult centers of Hatti and in the cities of Syria, but also as they exist in Aššur and Nineveh, the latter appearing at the very top of the list:

Commonalities in Anatolian, Assyrian, and even Israelite ritual practice are further evident in divination with stones (cleromancy or psephomancy),31 while the Hurrian underpinnings of Assyrian state rituals are discussed in Chapter Ten.32 Anatolian-Assyrian interaction in the religious sphere is apparent already in the Old Assyrian period in Assyrian merchant documents from Kültepe/Kaneš that refer to the Anatolian goddess Anna, who is always linked with other goddesses associated with the sea or with rivers.33 Commonalities between Assyrian and Hurrian religious practices are evident in the use of the bīt hamri, which was a sacred precinct. The bīt hamri is attested in the trading center of Kanesh near ‘the gate of the god,’ where oaths were sworn between the representatives of the local government and representatives of the merchants from Aššur by the dagger of the god Aššur.34 A bīt hamri asscociated with the Hurrian storm god is attested in Old Babylonian Šaduppum, which by that time was part of the Tigridian kingdom of Ešnunna and appears to have had a strong Hurrian presence.35 It reappears in Aššur in a Middle Assyrian ritual that includes a procession of the storm god Adad to various temples, city gates, and the bīt hamri itself.36 Adad assumed a particular role as guardian of oaths, and it is in this context that the bīt hamri played an important role.37 “The importance of Adad within the traditional pantheon of the city of Aššur is also highlighted by the fact that the ancient institution of choosing a yeareponym was performed before Aššur and Adad.38 Another Middle Assyrian ritual, KAR 139, revolves around an object called the Mouth-Tongue (KA.EME) and a supplicant. As I will discuss in Chapter Ten such objects are attested in Hittite rituals. The site where the ritual of KAR 139 is performed also links it to Hurrian ritual practice, as it takes place in the bīt ēqi in Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta. It is important to mention the so-called Assyro-Mitannian tablets in this context, as this group of magic-medical texts found at Hattuša point to close

interaction between Mitannian and Assyrian scribes during the fourteenth century BCE. These texts have been labeled Assyro-Mitannian because of their mixture of Mitannian and Assyrian sign forms.39 Their language is Standard Babylonian, but they include a number of irregular forms and (Hurro)-Assyrianisms that reveal the scribe’s partial familiarity with the Babylonian milieu.40 The origin of these texts is unknown but it has been suggested that they hail from Assyria when it was still dominated by Mitanni. The content, language, and syllabary of the tablets clearly point to an ultimately Babylonian origin for these texts, which among others include an incantation against stillbirth, an eliminatory ritual of the marriage of the eṭemmu, and a ritual for the expulsion of the watchful demon (hajjāṭu) and the rābiṣu-demon.41 For the purpose of this book the importance of these texts lies not so much in their presence in Bogazköy, to which they must have been brought as booty in the course of some military campaign probably by Suppiluliuma I. Rather, their significance lies in the fact that they point to close cultural interaction between Assyrians and Mitannians during the time of Mitannian dominance over Aššur and demonstrate that there was Assyrian scholarly activity before it appears in known texts from the city of Aššur. It is scholarly activity of this kind that explains the elaborate style of the Adad-nīrārī I Epic, the first literary text of the Middle Assyrian period to have come down to us, which – despite its fragmentary state of preservation – bears the typical traits of Assyrian epic literature and attests to a fully developed genre thus evidencing the high education of its author. Equally important is the fact that Mitanni appears to have made use of a system of territorial administration that divided land into provinces, as is the case for Assyria in the Middle Assyrian period. This system likely originated in the Old Babylonian period, as it is in texts from Mari and in Middle Assyrian texts that the term halṣ/zu designates a province.42 Termini technici in the Assyrian language for military or administrative officials such as šiluhlu, gelzuhlu and hassihlu are in turn derived from the Hurrian language, as is demonstrated by the presence of the Hurrian suffix –ohlu.43 These termini technici attest to

North-South Interaction and the Syro-Anatolian Impact on Assyrian Culture 51
the persistence and survival of certain Hurrian administrative practices and traditions in the organization of the Middle Assyrian state. A particularly revealing example of the complexity of cultural transmission within the larger ancient Near Easter koine is the fact that a person with a Hurrian name held the office of court diviner and the office of the zabar-dab5 at the court of the Ur III kings, indicating the deep familiarity with and integration in Sumero-Babylonian culture of at least some individuals with Hurrian names – and therefore presumably of Hurrian origin. The court diviner Tahišatal appears frequently in the Puzriš-Dagan archive and also in documents from Umma ranging in date from Amar-Sîn to Šu-Sîn.44 The zabar-dab5, who was superior to the chief of the cupbearers and acted as the overseer of the diviners,45 was responsible both for the administration of offerings for the temple and the royal cult46 and probably served as adviser to the king. The occupation of such high office by Hurrians suggests that at the end of the third millennium Hurrians were not being marginalized and stereotyped as the ‘Other.’ Rather, they were either highly regarded on account of their religious expertise, which must have been rooted in an urban cultural tradition that was comparable in its complexity to that of southern Mesopotamia, or they were by that point so thoroughly integrated into southern Mesopotamian society that meaningful distinctions between Hurrians and autochthonous populations are not recoverable. The title zabar-dab5 remained in use in the late Middle Babylonian period, where it applied to Esagil-kin-apli, scholar of King Adad-apla-iddina (10691048 BCE), and reflected a similar range of functions as it did under the Ur III kings.47 During the Neo-Assyrian period, the first member of the family of exorcists attested at Aššur, Baba-šuma-ibni, is generally described in the genealogical formulas with the title zabardubbû bīt Aššur, but is once called MAŠ.MAŠ bīt kiššūti, exorcist of the “House of Might” (i.e. the Aššur temple).48 Babašuma-ibni’s use of the title zabardubbû for the office of exorcist is a clear indi
44 Sharlach 2002, 111‒113. 45 See the following dedicatory inscription by the zabardab of Shulgi: “Shulgi, the mighty one, king of Ur, king of the four corners of the world: Nanna-zišagal, ..., zabardab, chief cupbearer, overseer of the diviners, is your servant. Seal of Nanna-zišagal” (After Sallaberger in Sallaberger and Westenholz 1999, 187). 46 Sallaberger 1999, 187‒88. 47 Esagil-kin-apli calls himself zabardabbû of Ezida thus referring to his organizing and administrative functions regarding the cult of that temple, Finkel 1988, 148‒149: 22′; Heeßel 2010, 140; note that in Babylonian during the OB period the zabardabbû was an “official of the palace, in a senior military capacity,” see Podany 2002, 121 with reference to CAD Z, 6. 48 Pedersén 1986, 45 (471).



52 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and Traditions in Mesopotamia
cation that the exorcist, in addition to organizing the cult of the Aššur temple, also acted as educator of the crown prince and adviser to the king. These functions are independently attested in the correspondence between the king Esarhaddon, the crown prince Ashurbanipal and the exorcist Adad-šumu-uṣur, for instance.49 The cultic aspect of the Assyrian king’s position as the chief šangû of the supreme god Aššur is a further example of an Assyrian cultural practice that bridges between the Syro-Anatolian and Assyrian cultural realms, as the performance of this office is likewise a prominent role of the Hittite king.50 I will discuss this point further in Chapter Five. Last but not last one might want to mention Assyrian emulation of Hittite architectural design in the building of their palaces in Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Nineveh. Royal Inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III, Sargon, and Sennacherib reveal that these kings were familiar with palatial structures built in the SyroHittite, Luwian, and Levantine territories, which were still called after the Hittites. They all recorded the construction of buildings referring either to the bīt hilāni-style or that they conceived of their palaces as replica of a palace of the land of Hatti (tamšīl ekal māt Hatti).51
The above survey merely touches upon a few of the most obvious common cultural features and practices linking the Hurrian-Hittite and Assyrian cultural horizons. I will pursue some of them in more depth over the course of this book. Before I do, it is necessary to outline the initial spread of the southern cuneiform tradition towards the north. It is also important in this context to observe the cultural interaction between north and south that resulted from this spread of cuneiform culture in order to sketch in broad strokes a number of tropes that were ultimately incorporated into the rich tapestry of Assyrian royal discourse, particularly during the Middle and Neo-Assyrian periods.
2.3 Early Beginnings in the South and the Spread of the Cuneiform Tradition
In the fourth millennium, the first city state was established at the urban center of Uruk in southern Mesopotamia. It was characterized by an integrated economy that bound the urbanized core to its hinterland and eventually impelled the invention of a notation system. Due to the increasingly hierarchical sociopolitical character of Uruk, the city was capable of mobilizing labor and resour

Early Beginnings in the South and the Spread of the Cuneiform Tradition 53
ces and developed into a political and administrative center. In this capacity, Uruk faced new challenges in accounting and accountability. Clay tokens and cylinder seals had been in use for millennia. What was new in Uruk was the appearance of clay tablets with numerical signs and the inclusion of tokens in clay bullae, which could be sealed and marked on the outside with impressions of the tokens within. These innovations are attested not only in Uruk, but also in northern Mesopotamia, Syria, and to the east in Susiana,52 bespeaking the phenomenon that has been termed the Uruk Expansion.53 A further notational device called a “numerico-ideographic” tablet is known only from Uruk and Susiana in this period. Numerico-ideographic tablets consist of simple numerical notations with the inclusion of one or at most two groups of ideograms representing discrete objects. These objects, with their combination of a numerical system and ideograms reflecting words, mark the beginning of proto-cuneiform. Further, “the idea that commodities, titles, names and transaction types could be represented graphically led almost immediately to the elaboration of an entire system of signs.”54 The development of a complex repertoire of signs eventually resulted in the production of lexical texts, lists of words arranged by topic or category.55 Subsequently, during the Early Dynastic period, there follow the first literary and commemorative texts, which present a complex characterization of the king as caretaker of the temple. This rapid development from numeric-ideographic notation to the articulation of a royal ideology strongly suggests the professionalization of the scribal guild in the service of rulership. Sumerian cuneiform was adopted by many of the cultures of the ancient Near East as the script for writing their local languages. This was the case in Ebla with Eblaite, in Iran with Elamite, and in northern Mesopotamia with Hurrian during the third millennium, and later applied equally in Anatolia with Hittite and Urartian. The broad distribution of Sumerian cuneiform is further evidence of the cultural prestige that Sumerian “scholarship” had accrued during its formative period, as well as of the potential of the graphemic system to meet both administrative and cultural needs. Around 2500 BCE, we encounter a “well-developed multi-lingual tradition that was shared by various independent southern cities and reached far beyond to Syria and perhaps elsewhere.”56 The first god lists from Fara57 and Abu

Ṣālābīḥ date to the Early Dynastic IIIa period (2600‒2500 BCE),58 as does the first cycle of temple hymns, likewise from Abu Ṣālābīḥ.59 These texts point not only to the existence of experts versed in the necessities of the local cult but also imply a conscious endeavor to create a culturally coherent system of supra-regional dimensions.60 The scholars who created these texts contributed to the shaping of an entire cultural discourse. This is most apparent in the intertwining of literary and lexical genres on one tablet61 and sometimes even in the same text, so that some literary texts adopted the template of lexical lists.62 Incantations also exhibit literary features, so that it is difficult to distinguish between literary and performative texts.63 The earliest cosmogonies appear at Abu Ṣālābīḥ64 and Nippur65 alongside this multiplicity of text genres. One of them, known as the Barton Cylinder, tells the story of a food shortage at Nippur that is remedied by the warrior god Ninurta. This cosmogony anticipates a later Sumerian mythic tradition revolving around the warrior god, as recounted in compositions such as Lugal-e66 and Angimdimma (= Ninurta’s Return to Nippur),67 and demonstrates that already in the Early Dynastic period there existed a cultural discourse extolling the figure of the heroic warrior who combats the forces threatening the existing cosmic order epitomized by the city. Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures is the earliest known work of art that combines the myth of the divine warrior with an account of a historical king (fig. 4). Its pictorial program portrays a mythologized king performing the role of the warrior god Ningirsu/Ninurta through his martial deeds. On its obverse, the stele is divided into two registers. The upper register depicts the god Ningirsu holding a battle net crowned by the Anzû bird with his left hand, while inside the net are trapped the naked corpses of many soldiers; Ningirsu strikes the bald head of one of these soldiers with a mace held in his right hand. By means of its depiction of a crystallized action, namely the god’s ultimate and inevitable triumph, this iconography comprises the “icon” of Ningirsu’s victory rather

than a pictorial narrative.68 Behind Ningirsu stands his mother Ninhursag, crowned with a feather crown and with three maces protruding from each of her shoulders. In the later Anzû Myth Ninhursag is known to have offered Ninurta strategic advice on how to defeat the Anzû bird, and the same dynamic might be operating here. The lower register depicts Ningirsu on his chariot, which is pulled into the presence of Ninhursag by two winged lions. There is no mention of the chariot of Ningirsu in the text on the stele, though the image is known from other texts that recount Ningirsu’s victory over the lion-eagle Anzû and his subsequent triumphal procession into the city of Nippur. As such, to make sense of the imagery of Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures “prior knowledge on the part of the viewer would have been required, to which the representation stood in a referential status.”69 The reverse of the stele is divided into four registers. In the upper right corner of the uppermost register there appear the vultures for which the stele is named, grasping in their beaks the severed heads of the enemy soldiers of Umma. Below them the king advances together with his soldiers, trampling

underfoot the bodies of the fallen enemies and marching in the direction of a heap of human corpses and naked captives. The king’s phalanx is depicted in an orderly formation, attacking with raised shields and with its spears directed against the enemy. In the next register, the king leads his phalanx forward from his chariot. Here, the soldiers within the phalanx carry raised spears and battle axes, prepared to do battle with the enemy. Due to the fragmentary nature of the stele, it is unfortunately not clear against whom the king and his soldiers are advancing. The third register shows a naked priest on top of a mound of animals, libating in front of a large seated figure that has been variously interpreted as the king Eannatum or as the god Ningirsu. Irene Winter convincingly argues in favor of viewing this figure as the king Eannatum and restores the imagery of the stele accordingly.70 The fourth register is poorly preserved, but Winter describes the surviving fragment as follows: “one sees a hand at the far left grasping the butt of a long spear shaft, the tip touching the forehead of a bald enemy near the center of the band. The enemy faces the oncoming spear. His head emerges from a group of three additional bald heads before him all facing [the attacking figure].”71 The image of Ningirsu depicted on the obverse of the stele developed into one of the key metaphors of the kings of Lagaš, who described their election for kingship in these terms:
When Ningirsu, the warrior of Enlil, had granted the kingship of Lagaš to Uru’inimgina, ....72
This close relationship between the patron deity of a city, who assumes the role of the divine warrior, and the ruler of the city is equally characteristic of the ideological discourse of Ešnunna and Aššur in later times. At a certain point it becomes untenable to conceive of the spread of knowledge and the formulation of a royal ideological discourse as purely unidirectional processes. The earliest known example of a royal hymn comes from Ebla, suggesting that the royal hymn as a text category might have originated as a distinct northern tradition.73 This royal hymn is from an educational context and begins with three lines of a literary text before proceeding with a list of personal names containing the element ‘king’ (lugal):

Only a few Early Dynastic literary texts are known to have been transmitted directly into later literary tradition, but these texts nevertheless include important tropes and motifs that were integrated into later textual production. Among these tropes are the genealogy of gods, the concept of the me along with their primary attribution to Inanna,75 and the ascription of functional roles to certain gods, including the characterization of Ninurta as a warrior god and the portrayal of the sun god Utu as the chief judge.76 All of these conceptualizations of the divine realm survived into subsequent historical periods as key tropes and are notable for their incorporation into the cultural discourse of both Assyria and Babylonia. Royal commemorative inscriptions first appear in the north during the Early Dynastic period in a dynamic intercultural setting of competing city states. Though written by the kings of Kīš, these inscriptions have only been recovered in the Diyala region and at sites such as Nippur, Adab, and Girsu.77 The inscriptions enable a basic reconstruction of the geo-political environment at the beginning of the Early Dynastic IIIb period (2500‒2350 BCE), which was largely dominated by the competing city states of Ur and Uruk to the south and southwest, Umma (-Zabala) to the north, Lagaš (-Girsu-Nina) in the east, and Kīš and Akšak much further north again.78 Theological rationales underpin military narratives within the royal inscriptions from the very beginning, as is plain in Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures, which relates that the gods witnessed the treaty between the rulers of the city states of Umma and Lagaš. The Stele of the Vultures also happens to be the earliest known artifact to associate Ningirsu/ Ninurta with the figure of the king by combining the image of Ningirsu’s emblematic cosmic victory with a historical account of a king’s military campaign.79 It is therefore fundamental to our understanding of Mesopotamian royal ideology.

58 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and Traditions in Mesopotamia
In addition to literary texts and commemorative inscriptions, the Archaic List of Professions suggests an early tendency towards social hierarchies and a pyramidic social structure.80 During the Early Dynastic IIIb period (2500‒2340 BCE) Enmetena and Uru-ʾinimgina, rulers of the city state of Lagaš, establish freedom from debt slavery and corvée labor,81 a political act that persists into the Old Babylonian period in the form of the andurārum82 and the Old Babylonian mīšaru-edicts. The purpose of such reforms was to restore an original and more equitable social order. As such, they developed into a trope of royal ideological discourse, which aimed to demonstrate that the king was capable of reestablishing and maintaining the cosmic order envisioned and ordained by the gods. Royal action along the lines of these reforms implies a high level of centralized control, and in the particular case of the reforms of Uru’inimgina it is apparent that the palace controlled or at the very least had access to temple resources.83 Remarkably, the tradition of royally decreed social reforms was discontinued after the Old Babylonian period, resulting in gross social inequalities that had the potential to produce dramatic demographic changes, as is discussed by Liverani with reference to the Late Bronze Age.84 It thus appears that highly stratified societies emerged in the south during the Uruk IV, Jemdet Nasr, and Early Dynastic periods, with a ruler at the pinnacle of the social hierarchy. By this time the essential roles and key metaphors that shaped royal ideology in the future history of the ancient Near East had been established within cultural discourse. In addition to the king as war leader, a role represented in the Uruk IV sealings with prisoner scenes (fig. 5) and later in Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures, (fig. 4), two further tropes developed, namely the king as hunter (Lion Hunt Stele from Uruk, fig. 6) and the king as temple caretaker and provider for the cult (Uruk Vase, fig. 7 and Early Dynastic votive plaques such as the one of Ur-Nanše, fig. 8). The importance of the artifacts listed above is clear. They functioned as condensed ideograms expressing complex economic, socio-political, administrative, and ceremonial conceptualizations of social order. The production of these condensed expressions of complex ideas required not only a creative,

Although these tropes could exist independently of each other and within their own contexts, their existence bespeaks a weltanschauung that bound them to a system of thought in which the heroic deeds of the king were linked to his privileged access to the gods.

regard to the question of Assyrian ideological discourse and tradition, it is worthwhile exploring how these key metaphors or tropes were expressed in individual royal inscriptions and what individual Assyrian rulers chose to emphasize and elaborate.
2.4 The Spread of Mesopotamian Tradition to the North and its Interaction with the Hurrian Cultural Horizon
This book focuses on the religion and royal ideology of Assyria, yet one cannot understand Assyrian cultural discourse without reference to its broader context, i.e. the socio-political conditions prevailing in greater Mesopotamia. It is similarly ill-advised to assume a generalized cultural discourse for the entire ancient Near East. As such, it is worth stating that Urkeš and Aššur shared some features in their organization of power, at least during the Old Babyloni

an period. The same can be said of Syria in the second millennium, as is clear from Mari texts and also from later Emar texts.85 In a recent article Giorgio Buccellati collects references made to Urkeš in the Mari letters.86 The range and number of agents acting on behalf of the city of Urkeš is particularly striking, as is clear from Buccellati’s list: – ‘the city of Urkeš’ a-lum Ur-ké-eš15KI (44bis:21) – ‘the sons of my city’ DUMU.MEŠ a-li-ia (44bis:8) – ‘the men of Urkeš’ LÚ.MEŠ Ur-ké-ša-yuKI (69:9, a letter from Ašlakka; 105:7′ from Ašnakkum) – ‘the elders of Urkeš’ LÚ.ŠU.GI.ME Ur-ké-eš15KI (45:rev.12) – ‘the hābiru are assembled in Urkeš’ (100:22 f, from Ašnakkum) – ‘assembly’ puhrum and related verb (69:9 from Ašlakka; 99:rev.12′ from Ašnakkum; 113:10 from Šuduhum) – ‘Urkeš’ alone, referring to the population of the city as a whole is found in 48:59 (from Ašlakka); 98:17 (from Ašnakkum); possibly 140:17 (from Qa’a and Išqa, though here the name of Urkeš may simply refer to the place, not to the inhabitants).
Most of these agents – particularly the city as a collective, the elders, and the assembly – are also found in Old Assyrian Aššur, as I will show in the next chapter. The organization of power in Old Assyrian Aššur is therefore not an isolated case, but rather forms part of the northern Syrian cultural and political landscape. In both Urkeš and Aššur, however, the various collective urban political bodies were complemented by the presence of a single ruler, unlike in Emar, for instance, where so far the institution of kingship is not attested.87 Aššur’s early beginnings – the subject of the next chapter – are difficult to reconstruct. Nevertheless, analyzing the northward spread of cuneiform writing demonstrates that Aššur was not an isolated case either in its political organization or in its cultural discourse. Although “the use of cuneiform writing in the Hābūr region presupposes the use of lexical and literary texts from Mesopotamia,”88 several texts have been identified as indicating a local adaptation of southern cuneiform tradition. Important information can also be gleaned from sites such as Ebla, Urkeš, and the neighboring sites of Tell Brak and Tell Beydar.
85 Fleming 2004. 86 Buccellati 2013, 86. 87 Emar shares the institution of the tahtamum (assembly) with the city of Tuttul, situated downstream from Emar at the junction of the Balih River and the Euphrates, see Fleming 2004, 211‒217. 88 Sallaberger 2004, 38.



The Spread of Mesopotamian Tradition to the North 63
The diffusion of southern Mesopotamian cultural traditions into northern Mesopotamia in the Early Dynastic period is indicated not only by the spread of the corpus of lexical texts, but also by the dispersion of other texts. These include the hymn to the god Amaʾušumgal, known from Abu Ṣālābīḥ in the south and Ebla and possibly also Mari in the north,89 and a text about the Sumerian god Enki from Tell Beydar.90 The Enki Myth found at Tell Beydar exhibits a peculiar combination of qualities that identify it as the product of scholarly circles operating in northern Mesopotamia. Its paleography links it to the second phase of Ebla in the time of the vizier Ibrium, but it is written in Sumerian despite its Semitic milieu. Further, the material qualities of the Tell Beydar Enki Myth – particularly its large size and pointed corners, a format it has in common with literary-lexical and administrative texts from Fara, Abu Ṣālābīḥ, and Ebla – suggest familiarity with southern Mesopotamian scholarly practice. No parallel of the Tell Beydar Enki Myth has been recovered among the texts from Fara and Abu Ṣālābīḥ. The small scribal exercise tablets from Tell Beydar also do not contain excerpts from the standard lexical lists, adding to the perception that a local scribal tradition was at work. A further indication of the existence of a local scribal tradition in the north during the Early Dynastic IIIb period (2500‒2350 BCE) is the discovery of a fragment of the standard profession list ED Lu A in Tell Brak,91 which is contemporary with those found at Ebla and thus postdates ED Lu A texts from Fara and Abu Ṣālābīḥ. Exercise tablets containing excerpts from the Early Dynastic profession list Lu E found at Urkeš/Tell Mozan92 and in Gasur93 point to a the adoption of a distinct educational tradition in northern Mesopotamia that might have originated in Kiš rather than in Uruk.94 The paleographic features of the ED list Lu E found at Urkeš again suggest a close connection with Ebla,95 and the insertion of new entries into the list like scribe (dub.sar) and ruler (ensi2) reveal a deliberate modernization of southern tradition.96 The find spot of the profession list in Urkeš, namely within the palace AP, is a tantalizing hint of close interaction between the king and the local scholars or scribes. Further, the very

64 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and Traditions in Mesopotamia
presence of the profession list Urkeš – only about sixty kilometers north of Tell Brak – implies interaction with a cultural horizon that is specifically identifiable as Hurrian.97 During the Akkad period, Sargonic school tablets from Ešnunna98 and Tell Leilan99 vividly illustrate how Akkadian bureaucratic control was developed through the establishment of schools and the training of local scribes.100 The Old Akkadian tablets from Aššur still await publication. Communication between north and south was maintained through the trade route that passed by Akšak and Ešnunna before following along the Tigris river through Aššur and Nineveh and proceeding northwest towards Hamoukar and Tell Brak or Urkeš; this route then culminated in the Ergani mining area south of the source of the Tigris via the Mardin pass. Due to its location by the most important pass from Syro-Mesopotamia into Eastern Anatolia, Tell Mozan/Urkeš constituted the gateway into the Anatolian plateau. Once they had reached the plain at Mozan, merchants were able to proceed southward “either along the Khabur, reaching the Euphrates near Qraya and Terqa, or continue on the major east-west route, which followed the Khabur triangle either to the Balikh and Euphrates or in the direction of the Tigris.”101 Early urbanization in the area of Urkeš was stimulated by its geographic control over the route into the Ṭur-ʿAbdin highlands, a region rich in copper, timber, and stones that represented an essential component of the hinterland of Urkeš.102 Although Urkeš belonged to a different trading network,103 the attestation of scholastic traditions linking it with Ebla bespeaks the mobility of experts trained in Sumerian lore, a mobility that was constrained neither by political borders nor by trade relationships. Such early interaction between Urkeš and Ebla might explain much later finds in Old Babylonian Alalakh, which evinces a strong Hurrian presence during that period as well as under the rule of Mitanni. The early urbanization of Urkeš resulted in the production of texts that convey an official political message and thus allow a glimpse into an early Hurrian royal discourse that resonates with what we find later in Aššur and Nineveh. Traces of this process can be observed already in the period following the Akkadian empire, as inscriptions of Hurrian kings are attested in Nagar

(modern Tell Brak) and Karahar, located between Ešnunna and Simurrum. The inscriptions at both sites share a similar conceptualization of the king’s titulary, and refer to the king as ‘sun of the land,’ a title that is absorbed into the titulary of the Ur III kings only in the reign of Amar-Suen.

This solarization of the institution of kingship also occurs, albeit later, in the Old Syrian royal glyptic (ca. 1700 BCE) that depicts the winged disk hovering above the king.104 It dominates the iconography of Hurrian glyptic from the fifteenth century onwards, as well as the Hittite aedicule seals at a slightly later date. Eventually, solarization makes its way into the Assyrian conceptualization of the divine kingship of Aššur, which is most prominently represented in the winged Aššur hovering about the sacred tree flanked by a spectral representation of the king.105 A foundation tablet from Urkeš, dating either to the Akkad or Ur III period, mentions an important figure named Tiš-atal.106 This celebratory inscription is in Hurrian and refers to Tiš-atal as en-da-an Ur-kèški,107 commemorating Tišatal’s building of the temple of the god Nergal/Kumarbi?108 in Urkeš. As a commemorative inscription, it is of great value not only because it demonstrates the king’s involvement in fostering the cult, but also because its curse formula sheds light on intercultural contact between Urkeš and Nagar. The curse formula mentions the goddess Bēlat-Nagar, suggesting that the goddess Bēlat

Nagar of Tell Brak either had a cult in Urkeš, or that she had acquired supraregional status by this time:
1‒ 6 Tiš-atal, endan of Urkiš, built the temple of the god Nergal/Kumarbi?. 7‒10 May the god Lubdaga (Nupatik) protect this temple 11‒14 As for the one who destroys it, may the god Lubadaga (Nupatik) destroy (him). 15‒17 May the (weather-god(?) not hear his prayer. 18‒25 May the lady of Nagar, the sun-god, (and) the storm-god(?) ... him who destroys it.109
In this inscription, the local rulers of Urkeš affirm their cultural distinctiveness by using the Hurrian title endan, composed either of the Sumerian word en for ‘ruler’ or the Hurrian word for “god,” en(i), and the morpheme -dan or -tann/ -tenn indicating professional titles in Hurrian titulature.110 This usage demonstrates a Hurrian identity that is set against the contemporaneous supremacy of either the Akkadian or the Ur III empire.111 The supra-regional standing of Bēlat-Nagar is confirmed by her status as a divine witness in an Old Assyrian treaty that will be discussed below, thus providing another link between northern Syrian and Assyrian culture. BēlatNagar’s importance in the cult of Mari is suggested by the discovery in throne room 108 of a Hurrian incantation that refers three times to na-wa-ri.112 One of the Mari letters in turn states that Bēlat-Nagar traveled through the region of Ida-Maraṣ in Northern Syria, possibly to mark the territory under the control of the king of Mari.113 Bēlat-Nagar also appears in a Hurrian context in an offering list from Ugarit.114 As observed by Dietrich and Mayer, the ritual texts from Ugarit exhibit a combination of Ugaritic and Hurrian language, the latter being used for offering lists and reflecting the frozen character that these texts had assumed by the Late Bronze Age.115

Another Tiš-atal, described as the “man (lú) of Nineveh,”116 is known from an administrative document from Ešnunna that dates to the Ur III period. This text records the distribution of flour by the ensi2of Ešnunna to Tiš-atal and more than a hundred of his followers when they journeyed to that city on a diplomatic mission.117 The Hurrian name of the Ninevite ruler Tiš-atal reflects the prominent Hurrian presence in Nineveh, which is also apparent in a loyalty oath from Nippur that was sworn by Tiš-atal and eighty other Ninevites in the third year of Šu-Sîn’s reign.118 Šu-Sîn was married to a woman named Tiamatbašti, who has been tentatively identified as the daughter of Tiš-atal and who had strong ties to Ištar-Šauška.119 Finally, the foundation inscription of Tiš-atal of Urkeš affirms a distinct Hurrian identity at the same time that it demonstrates the adaptation of the cuneiform writing system to render the Hurrian language.120 A salient feature of the Hurrian bureaucratic scribal system is the widespread use of Sumerian and Akkadian logograms. Nevertheless, at least one of the administrative tablets from Urkeš, while written with Sumerograms and Akkadograms, was likely read in Hurrian,121 thus pointing to the development of a distinctive Hurrian bureaucratic language. The foundation tablet of Tišatal and the Hurrian administrative texts represent the beginnings of a royal ideological discourse within a Hurrian tradition and expressed in the Hurrian language. This evidence is sparse, but the traditions it attests are found again many centuries later in the libraries of Hattuša and in the bureaucratic language of Mitanni. Furthermore, the iconography of a seal impression depicting a divine figure astride a mountain range constitutes a cultural image that is altogether

It led Maiocchi to posit that the seals of the royal family bearing the local title endan should “also be viewed as Hurrian, despite the extensive use of sumerograms.” He suggests such an underlying reading in Hurrian even for tablets characterized by the absence of Hurrian morphemes.

independent of the south (fig. 9). Whereas no comparable representations are known from the Mesopotamian glyptic tradition, the image is strikingly reminiscent of the later Hurrian mythic tradition describing the god Kumarbi as walking in the mountains.122 This theme also evokes the relief of a mountain god from the well of the Aššur temple (fig. 10), which has been associated with Kassite iconography123 and interpreted as a personification of Mount Ebih.124 It may, however, simply be a depiction of the god Aššur that shares commonalities with the Hurrian tradition, especially because Kumarbi represents a combination of toponym and genitive suffix that is comparable to the use of the name Aššur to denote both the city and its patron deity.125 In Mesopotamian tradition, the equivalence of a toponym with the name of a patron deity generally applies to female goddesses. In the Song of Silver, however, Kumarbi is said to be the Father of Urkeš and his sister Šauška is described as the queen of Nineveh.126 On the one hand, this points to the pantheon of the Hurrian city

Azuhinni headed by Kumarbi and Ištar-Šauška,127 while on the other hand it establishes a direct link between the Hurrian and Assyrian cultural horizons:
Oh Silver! The city you inquire about, I will describe to you. Your father is Kumarbi, the Father of the city Urkeš. He resides in Urkeš, where he rightfully resolves the lawsuits of all the lands. Your brother is Tešup: he is king in heaven and is king in the land. Your sister is Šauška, and she is queen in Nineveh. You must not fear any of them. Only one deity you must fear, Kumarbi, who stirs up the enemy land and the wild animals (adapted from Hoffner 1990:46‒47).
The myth reflects the relationship between the mountain people who mine silver and the city, administered and protected by the god Kumarbi. This god is set into a genealogical relationship with the storm god Teššub and IštarŠauška of Nineveh, which at the time of Šamšī-Adad I was heavily Hurrianized.

70 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and Traditions in Mesopotamia
By contrast, texts such as the royal ritual KUB 27.38 reveal a fusion of Hurrian and Akkadian traditions. This is evident in the list of images of divine kings (Dšarri=n(a)=āš=e) that includes Nawar and Atalšen, king of Urkeš, as well as a list of wise kings that begins with Narām-Sîn, whose name is written with the determinative sign for gods, and proceeds with Sargon of Akkad, king Audalumma of Elam, Iammahu of Lullu, Kiglipadalli of Tukriš, and Maništušu and Šarkališarri.128 This text also introduces “Silver, king (ewri), as king (šarra) ...; Hedam(m)u, king (ewri), Kumarbi created you as king (šarra).”129 Evidence of Hurrian settlements is not limited to Urkeš. While there were probably only a few urban centers with a particularly Hurrian identity, these are all located in the piedmont zone of the Anatolian plateau and might include sites like Tell Huēra, Tell Leilan, and Nineveh.130 The spottiness of the evidence is possibly due to the fact that the core territory of the Hurrians “seems to have been the rural highland of the Ṭur-ʿAbdin, from where they spilled over only to a very limited extent in the immediate piedmont region to the south, which became their sole urban base in the third, and possibly already in the fourth, millennium – Urkeš being so far the only demonstrable example.”131 I have dwelt at such length on the early evidence of a Hurrian presence in the piedmont region of the Ṭur-ʿAbdin because, although it is sparse, it nonetheless points to the existence of an early Hurrian scribal and scholarly tradition that mediated the tension between local tradition and the cuneiform writing system with its attendant culture. This mediation shaped the value system and cultural expression of Hurrian identity, which interacted with Assyrian culture. Other intriguing features of Hurrian material culture from Urkeš include the temple, which was probably dedicated to the Hurrian chief god Kumarbi,132 and the apu, an elaborate monumental pit lined with stone that, as later Hurrian ritual texts suggest, served as a nexus for evoking the spirits of the Netherworld.133 While the pit structure endured into the second millennium, the temple remained in use for over two thousand years until the end of the Mitannian kingdom.134 The archaeological evidence of the apu should probably be linked

with the cult of Kumarbi and/or the ancestor cult at Urkeš, which ties in well with the Tigridian custom of referring to lineage in order to legitimize the claim to rulership. Similar cultural strategies are attested in Aššur and Ešnunna.135 The apu reappears in a Neo-Assyrian ritual that is discussed in Chapter Ten. It should be noted that the earliest areas settled by Hurrians were the north-eastern Jazira and what later became northern Assyria. According to a letter from Arad-mu, the chancellor of the Ur III state, Hurrian settlement extended into the Diyala region by the Ur III period.136 The Ur III king Šulgi built a temple for the patron deity of Ešnunna, who was addressed as Ninazu in Sumerian and as Tišpak in Akkadian. Subsequently, use of Hurrian language spread towards south central Anatolia and northern and central Syria, as is clear from texts found in Kültepe, Mari, and Alalakh VII, as well as in late preSargonic Ebla. Indeed, Hurrian may have reached as far as Tunip, south of Ebla.137 Hurrian identity west of the Euphrates and south of the Anti-Taurus seems to have been well established by the time of Kültepe Ib, as is demonstrated by a letter mentioning witnesses bearing Hurrian names, several of whom are said to be from Haššum.138 While this evidence is primarily based on the attestation of Hurrian personal names, it is worth noting that the deities of Haššum carried away by Hattušili I only a century later included the Weather god of Armaruk/ Arruza, the Weather god of Aleppo, Hebat, Allatum/Allani,139 mount Adalur, and Lel(l)uri, who are divinities associated with a Hurrian identity. In the second half of the second millennium BCE, Lelluri is “particularly prominent in the (h)išuwa-festival of Kizzuwatna attested abundantly at Hattusha.”140 Still another important document indicating the presence of a Hurrian stream of tradition in the west is the Hurro-Hittite bilingual known as the Ebla Epic or Epos der Freilassung/Song of Release.141 Although it was written in 1400 BCE, the historical background of the story seems to be the final phase of Ebla
135 Here I have to correct myself, as in earlier years I considered Assyrian interest in genealogies a product of Amorite impact, see Pongratz 1997, 89. 136 Michalowski 1986, 142 and 2011, 249‒272. 137 Wilhelm 2008, 181, 186 f. 138 Hecker 1996; Wilhelm 2008. 139 Allatum/Allani, goddess of the netherworld, is attested as early as 2000 BCE in Northern Syria, see Wilhelm 1982, 78. 140 Wilhelm 2008, 191; For the assumption that the (h)išuwa-festival was influenced by the cult of Haššu see Wilhelm 1992; on the festival see further Wegner and Salvini 1991 and Strauß 2006, 11‒13. 141 Neu 1996; Hoffner 1998; de Martino 2000; Wilhelm 2001 and 2011.

in the Middle Bronze II period, suggesting that the text is of Old Syrian origin142 and that it only later became part of Hurrian and ultimately Hittite tradition. The Song of Release recounts the story of the enslavement and liberation of the inhabitants of the city of Igingalliš under their leader Purra, who assumes mythical dimensions. Igingalliš, which is also attested in the res gestae of Hattušili I,143 was located somewhere to the south of the Antitaurus and west of the Euphrates.144 According to Wilhelm, it is likely that the Song of Release “forms part of old traditions about earlier events in the lands south of the Anatolian plateau and the Taurus chain, including events of the Mari period which presumably were written in Hurrian and later were adopted by the Hittites.”145 Wilhelm further stresses that the Hurrian tradition attested at Hattuša preserves the memory of the ancient kings of Akkad along with that of other third millennium kings. In his view, this implies the incorporation of third millennium historical events and experiences into a mythological tradition by an established Hurrian scholarly elite; this elite then transmitted this historicalmythological tradition into the second millennium, where it was subsequently adopted by the Hittites. The creation of a cultural body of knowledge of this kind entails a longstanding tradition of scribal and scholarly education in the Hurrian cultural milieu. In this context one might also want to mention the Old Babylonian city state of Tigunānum, “known locally and to the Hittites as Tikunani or Tikunan.”146 In his publication of the texts Andrew George suggested that it was probably located near modern Bismil on the way to Ergani.147 More recently he tends to locate it south of the Ṭur-ʿAbdin, as he sees connections with Assyrian trade routes to the west including way stations such as the cities of Hahhum, Zalpar, Nihriya, Eluhut, Huršanum, Ašnakku, and Burundi.148 The history of Tigunānum goes back to the time of Yahdun-Līm of Mari.149 During the later Old Babylonian period, ca. 1630 BCE., this city state was ruled by TunipTeššub, contemporary of Hattušili I,150 whose palace archives yielded several

tablets, among them a “Sumero-Hurrian recension of an Old Babylonian text ancestral to Urra XV‒XVI”151 and several omen tablets, of which some were written by a diviner named Kuzzi who was “the authority active in forming the local divinatory tradition.”152 This diviner probably acted as advisor to the king, as many omen tablets bear a colophon that locate his tablets in the palace; they were written by one of his pupils, “hand of Šamaš-muštēšir, in the palace of King Tunip-Teššub.”153 The omen tablets show indented lines after the first line, a feature typical of omen tablets written in north Mesopotamia and its periphery.154 They further show Hurrian glosses and Hurrianizing language and orthographic features diagnostic of peripheral Akkadian thus attesting to a tradition that originated in north Mesopotamia and went alongside Babylonian tradition, equally attested in the archive.155 These omen texts display distinctive Syro-Anatolian cultural features. As noted by Andrew George:
In many apodoses the storm god Adad is prominent as the divine arbiter of political and military power. The twin mountains Nanni and Hazzi, which in Syrian and Hittite traditions are sacred to the storm god (Teššub, Baal-Zaphon etc.) and support him, appear in two apodoses ... The deity Allantum, who appears in still another apodosis ... is the Hurrian earth goddess Allani ..., but with Akkadian feminine ending (the usual Babylonian form is Allatum). Several texts include apodotic clauses that refer to the Habiru as a military force .... These are religious and political circumstances alien to southern Mesopotamia but familiar to the north and north-west.156
Another striking feature of the texts from Tigunānum is that they are dated by līmu in Assyrian fashion, listing personnel of King Tunip-Teššub.157 The Tigunānum texts further include three rituals of which one revolves around the king receiving a new silver ring every day which he passes on to the haruspex. Another very fragmentary ritual includes Ištar and the king and a third one seems to describe a procession of Ištar of Ninet/Nineveh to several cities.158 The presence of a ritual for the patron deity of Nineveh speaks for a close relationship between the cities of Tigunānum and Nineveh which is further confirmed by letters from Tigunānum.159 The prominence of Adad and Ištar in

the religious texts from Tigunānum reflects a tradition known already from the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend from Kanesh,160 the official pantheon of the Mitanni empire,161 and then from Middle Assyrian curse formulas in the inscriptions of Adad-nīrārī I and Shalmaneser I at the time of the first major Assyrian expansion to the west,162 as well as from Neo-Assyrian penalty clauses.163 As meager as the evidence might be, it nevertheless constitutes a clear indication that there existed a distinct Hurrian stream of tradition that influenced Assyrian ideological discourse. In this context it is legitimate to ask whether Hurrian scholarly circles were also responsible for the transmission of the Sargon of Akkad tradition attested in the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend found at Kültepe, which is discussed in Chapter Four. Early evidence for the spread of Hurrian tradition into northern Mesopotamia of the kind outlined above helps explain why in the early Middle Assyrian period King Adad-nīrārī I was able to draw so readily upon Mitannian administrative practices while pursuing his expansionist interests.164 After all, Mitanni possessed a bureaucratic tradition that presumably appealed to the needs of Assyria’s ambitious imperialistic program and was intelligible from the perspective of Assyrian cultural and political horizons.
2.5 Excursus: The Cultural Impact of Treaties
Since the international treaties of the northern Syrian region and the divinities they include as divine witnesses have already been mentioned, I discuss their cultural function in more detail here.165 The spread of cuneiform culture166 throughout the ancient Near East in the later Early Dynastic period (2500‒2350 BCE) coincides with some of the earliest evidence of official treaties,167 such as one drawn up between Ebla and the neighboring kingdom of Abarsal.168 The

Excursus: The Cultural Impact of Treaties 75
Ebla text has been characterized as a calligraphic master copy169 and reflects a level of scribal culture that went far beyond the basic training of a scribe.170 Administrative texts of Ebla attest to a lively diplomatic exchange with messengers from the numerous kingdoms around Ebla visiting frequently the temple of Kura in Ebla to swear an oath of alliance. It is interesting to note that the principal deity of the city served as the sole supervisor of the treaty.171 Written evidence for diplomatic activities include further the exchange of gifts prior to the conclusion of a treaty between Ebla and Mari172 and a reference to a treaty between Ebla and Nagar/Tell Brak sworn in the temple of Dagan in Tuttul. These texts demonstrate the spread of distinctive forms of knowledge during the Early Dynastic period, including the organization of local panthea and the ritual performance of loyalty oaths.173 Because they refer to and accept a third, presumably neutral deity as arbiter and witness – like Dagan in the treaty between Ebla and Nagar – treaties also expose an implicit acknowledgement of a shared culture that was common to numerous northern Syrian city states. Treaties further demonstrate that the scholars of the time, while serving divergent political interests, operated within broader networks that were capable of transcending political and cultural borders. Treaty making in particular involved ratification ceremonies that included oath taking and the cursing of any future violators. These ceremonies could only develop with the mediation of the broader scholarly networks mentioned above.174 During ratification ceremonies, scholarly experts had to coordinate the translocal or “international” involvement of the gods of the respective parties and ensure their cross-regional and cross-cultural recognition and translatability.175 Moreover, the treaty between Ebla and Nagar sworn in the temple of Dagan at Tuttul suggests that, at least in some early treaties, the ceremony was performed under the purview of a third divine party that was supra-regionally

acknowledged. The same is true for the pre-Sargonic kings of Lagaš, who mention Ištaran of Der as the divine intermediary in their conflict with Umma, while the role of earthly intermediary was performed by Mesalim, king of Kiš.176 The supra-regional aspects of treaties also characterize the treaty concluded between the city assembly of Aššur and king Till-Abnû of Apum, a polity close to Tell Leilan that had its own kārum in the Old Assyrian period. After 2200 BCE, Apum superseded Tell Leilan as local capital until the latter was chosen by Šamšī-Adad I as his residence and turned into a hub of international relations.177 Among other clauses, the treaties from Tell Leilan and Apum define the import taxes that are to be paid by Assyrian merchants to the local ruler, who granted residence rights and guaranteed the safe passage of caravans in return. Of particular interest for the reconstruction of the cultural-religious discourse of Old Assyrian Aššur is the list of deities by whom Till-Abnû, king of Apum, swore his oath not to the king but to the Assyrians, i.e. the representatives of the “city of (divine) Aššur, the son(s) of (divine) Aššur in transit, and the kārum in your city:”178

Till-Abnû, son of Dari-Epuh, 25 king of Apum to the city assembly of divine Aššur.180
This section of the treaty lists the deities by whom the ruler of Apum is expected to swear the oath to the city assembly of Aššur. It begins by listing the most important deities of both parties, while consistently prioritizing Assyrian deities. The beginning of the god list is particularly striking due to its combination of a supra-regional and local perspective. The triad of the originally Sumero-Babylonian gods Anu, Enlil, and Ea is amended in a specifically northern fashion by replacing Ea with Šarru-mātīn, who should be equated with Aššur.181 Dagan is listed next as still another supra-regional deity who had important cultic centers first in Tuttul (ED) and later in Terqa (OB). The astral aspects of Adad, Sîn, and Šamaš follow, and this programmatic astral dimension is reminiscent of the curse section of a treaty from Ebla (2400‒2250 BCE) that invokes the sun goddess, the storm god Adda, and the deity ‘star’ (MUL = Ištar?).182 Such an invocation of astral deities also occurs in the oaths listed at the beginning of treaties from Mari,183 in Hittite treaties, and in the treaty between Ini-Teššub and the king of Ugarit.184 The function of the moon god as protector of and witness to treaties is a particularly Hurrian tradition that distinguishes this deity from his Sumero-Babylonian counterparts.185 These astral deities are subsequently attested among the recipients of offerings in the Mid

dle Assyrian coronation ritual186 and in a lexical list from Tell Barri.187 In the first millennium BCE they appear at the beginning of the Neo-Assyrian loyalty oaths. This history qualifies astral deities as playing a central role in northern Syrian and Assyrian tradition. Following the astral deities, the treaty between the city assembly of Aššur and king Till-Abnû of Apum lists a number of local divinities who had gained supra-regional status by the time of the Old Babylonian period. These include Nergal-of-Hubšalum, who also surfaces in Mari texts188 (Hubšalum is located near Andarig); the Assyrian Ištar;189 Bēlat-Apum, a local hypostasis of Ištar in the land of Apum,190 whose cult was probably transferred to Tell Leilan after Šamšī-Adad I made it his residence;191 the Hurrian Bēlat-Ninuwa, who was venerated at Aššur192 and later in numerous Hittite and Hurrian cities; and Ninkarrak193 and Išhara,194 both Syrian goddesses.195 In its final section, the god list records the deified mountains, rivers, heaven, and earth, as well as deified topographical features like the mountain ranges of the Sinjar (Saggar and Zara).196 At the very end of the list appear deified Amurru and Subartu.

Yet evidence from Ebla, for instance, in which Martu is used as a gentilic rather than a geographic term suggests that Martu in the Old Assyrian treaty designates the personification of the Amorites rather than a mere direction.

probably designate the divine personification of the Amorites as an ethnic group, who originated in the region of Mount Bišri, and of the Hurrians, who originated in eastern Anatolia. In lines 20‒23, the treaty between Aššur and the land of Apum identifies the gods by which the oath is sworn as those of Amurru and Šubarum: “Swear by the god(s) of Martu and Šubārum, swear by all these gods that are present.” This passage suggests that the gods were all present in some form in the temple where the oath was taken.198 Also interesting is the fact that at the time of this treaty – at some point after the reign of Šamšī-Adad I – Aššur is conceived of as part of Subartu, while in earlier times it was distinguished from Akkad, Amurru, and Šubarum.199 Finally, the treaty clearly does not express a royal point of view, at least insofar as Assyria is concerned. Rather, it exemplifies a scholarly involvement in political exchange that is not dependent on “royal ideology.”200
2.6 The Dynasty of Akkad and the Creation of Charismatic Kingship
At the beginning of this chapter I suggested that the attestations of royal ideological discourse represented by inscriptions from Aššur, the eastern Tigridian area, and Urkeš testify to an attempt by local kingdoms to define their own cultural discourse in the face of the expansionist ambitions of the kings of Akkad. It is therefore appropriate to examine the ideological discourse of the kings of Akkad as the other crucial component in the development of northern and southern royal ideology. Because the city of Akkad has not yet been discovered (it was probably close to modern Baghdad), we have only a few fragments of the cultural texts that were produced under the aegis of its kings.201 So far incantations and hymns have been recovered,202 while royal inscriptions, in contrast, are known primarily from Old Babylonian copies. After King Sargon (2334‒2279 BCE), the founder of the dynasty of Akkad (2350‒2150 BCE), defeated the coalition of Sumerian city states led by King Lugalzagesi, he built the city of Akkad as the seat of Akkadian kingship. An unprecedented process of enforced unification and political centralization fol

lowed, binding the former city states to the center by means of a centralized tax system. From the strategic location of Akkad the Sargonic kings could control all of southern Mesopotamia and expand more easily toward the north. Distant forays into Elam in the East and into the Upper Tigris and Upper Euphrates regions were launched in order to secure and monopolize trade routes. The progressive imposition of central control that began with the founding of a new capital at Akkad and the subjugation of the area around the confluence of the Diyala and Tigris rivers is reflected in Sargon’s adoption of the title “king of Akkad.” Following the Kišite precedent, the Sargonic kings also assumed the title “king of Kish.” The assumption of this title implied the adoption of the role of arbiter associated with the kings of Kīš, as is reflected for instance in the king of Kīš’s arbitration in the dispute between the kings of Lagaš and Umma and in the historical inscriptions of the rulers of the Early Dynastic III period. After his conquest of the south, Sargon added the epithets “governor of Enlil” (šakin Enlil) and “anointed priest of Anu” (pašīš Anu) to his titulary. Interestingly, with the exception of the title “king of Akkad” royal titles reflecting the king’s service to the gods precede titles reflecting his earthly rulership in recitations of the king’s titulary. This is also true for later Assyrian titulary:
Sargon, king of Akkad, bailiff of Ištar, anointed priest of Anu, lord of the land, chief governor of Enlil, conquered the city Uruk and destroyed its walls. ...203
Akkadian royal discourse preserves the traditional association of kingship with Inanna, though this function is transferred from the Sumerian deity to Ištar of Akkad. A curse formula of Narām-Sîn reads as follows: “may he hold no scepter for Enlil, may he not seize kingship for ‘Aštar.’”204 The elevation of Enlil, patron deity of Nippur, to the status of sovereign god of the pantheon with the responsibility for bestowing kingship – a responsibility evident in the royal title ‘governor of Enlil’ (šakin dEnlil) – can also be dated to the kings of Akkad. This innovation meant that the goddess Ištar now assumed the role of intermediary and advocate of the king before the divine council headed by Anu and Enlil.205 Ištar’s association with kingship nevertheless endured into the Old Babylonian period and beyond, as is plain in the royal hymns of the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian periods, as well as in the Etana Myth. The bestowal of royal insignia remained Ištar’s specific prerogative.

The Dynasty of Akkad and the Creation of Charismatic Kingship 81
Similarly, the earliest attestation of bilingual royal commemorative inscriptions hails from Sargon’s reign, which has been considered crucial in the development of Akkadian as a vehicle for formal written expression.206 It is at this time that the combination of formulaic language recording victorious campaigns, complex narratives addressing the reader, portrayals of the enemy, and assertions of the cosmic and historical significance of historical events originated.207 The military accounts of the kings of Akkad are highly detailed and “offer far more information on the king’s enemies. Sargon’s and Rīmuš’s monuments were decorated with reliefs depicting his defeated enemies, as identified by captions.”208 This is yet another feature linking the ideological discourse of northern Akkad with that of Aššur. In the vast corpus of Early Dynastic inscriptions, xenological discourse appears only in Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures and in Entemena’s account of his feud with Umma, both from Lagaš. Even in these texts, however, the gods are much more active participants than in the inscriptions of the Akkadian kings, which replace the victorious god with the king as the central actor in a novel conception of world dominion.209 The image-makers of the rulers of Akkad were clearly familiar with the visual conventions employed in Lagaš, in some cases possibly drawing their inspiration directly from pictorial monuments erected by the Early Dynastic III kings of that city. Despite the fragmentary nature of the diorite stele of Sargon (Louvre Sb 2, fig. 11), it is evident that its iconic representation of victory was inspired by Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures. A notable innovation in the Sargonic imagery is that it is now the king (Sargon himself) rather than the god of the victorious city (i.e. Ningirsu on the Stele of Eannatum) who holds the net and smites the enemy within it. Lorenzo Nigro has argued persuasively that the enemy chief in the stele of Sargon, depicted with his head protruding from the net, is Lugalzagesi of Uruk, who was vanquished by Sargon during his early military endeavors in southern Mesopotamia.210 The royal rank of the enemy being struck by Sargon is indicated by his beard and long, loose hair, “suggesting that he had just lost his royal hair buns while fighting in battle.”211 Opposite to the king is a seated figure with three undulating rays rising from the shoulder, one of them ending in a mace head. This detail has been convincingly interpreted as the attribute of Ištar in her warrior aspect, which would

identify the seated figure as Ištar.212 The elevation of Akkad’s patron deity to the rank of the Akkadian dynastic goddess and the syncretistic identification of Inanna of Uruk and Semitic Ištar were integral to Sargon’s religious reforms. Further, “the placement of the king’s daughter Enheduanna in the office of enpriestess at Ur and the renewed central role assigned to Enlil,” were, as Nigro contends, all means of “obtaining a cultural and ideological supremacy over the South and of gaining the political consensus of the powerful Mesopotamian clergy.”213 Ištar’s central role in kingship was also adopted by the rulers of Aššur during the Akkad period.214 Although the enemy figures trapped in the net are depicted naked in both Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures and in the stele of Sargon, only in the latter

do these enemies sit in an orderly formation and appear submissive. In the Stele of the Vultures, the god Ningirsu is shown achieving the ultimate cosmic victory over disruptive forces; in the stele of Sargon, this iconic representation is transformed and becomes an image of ongoing royal action under the guidance and protection of the dynastic goddess Ištar to ward off threats to civilization, thus affirming the victory of order over chaos. Sargon’s adoption of the central gesture of the warrior deity on his stele epitomizes the transition from the Early Dynastic programmatic statements combining myth and historical events to the ideological discourse of the Akkad period. The replacement of Ningirsu with the king in the pictogram with the net constitutes an appropriation of the mythic icon of victory by the king, thereby centering martial action primarily on himself. By the time of Sargon’s grandson Narām-Sîn, the transition is complete: the image of kingship becomes that of the “eternal” warrior, and on his famous Victory Stele Narām-Sîn is so completely identified with the role of the warrior god Ningirsu that he is represented as superhuman in size and in command of both life and death. Accordingly, the Victory Stele of Narām-Sîn marks the historical juncture at which the era of independent city states transitioned to one of unified empire and centralized kingship. Several strategies can be observed in the Victory Stele. As mentioned, Narām-Sîn emulates the depiction of the warrior god Ningirsu in Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures215 by representing himself as superhuman in size and capable of commanding life and death. The artistic choices made in Narām-Sîn’s Victory Stele contrast strongly with those in Eannatum’s stele, as the former “presents events not linearly or sequentially but hierarchically. Narām-Sîn, the mighty king of Akkad, is the telos of the temporal narrative. The king is therefore the culmination of the event.”216 Narām-Sîn’s body is portrayed emerging as a silhouette against the sky, walking on the mountaintop and crossing into territory hitherto uncharted by the kings of Mesopotamia. The imagery depicting the king mastering unknown territory is a new element in royal iconography. Although it commemorates the historical event of Narām-Sîn’s campaign against the Lullubu in the eastern mountains, the Victory Stele transforms Narām-Sîn visually into an icon of victory in the role of master of the universe. The gesture of the warrior god Ningirsu, whose power over the enemies in his net on Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures manifests the glorious outcome of the

battle, is replaced in the Victory Stele by the king shown in the heroic action of trampling over the defeated enemy. A variation of this triumph motif217 is known from the “war-side” of the Early Dynastic Banquet Stele from Ur, which shows the king driving over the bodies of the enemy with his chariot. Unlike Eannatum’s victory in the Stele of the Vultures, Narām-Sîn’s triumph is conceptualized as a human achievement accomplished by an ideal king. Narām-Sîn’s emulation of the warrior god Ningirsu/Ninurta – who by the end of the Early Dynastic period becomes established as the son of Enlil, chief god of the Sumerian pantheon and patron deity of Nippur218 – is total.

The Dynasty of Akkad and the Creation of Charismatic Kingship 85
The image of the ideal king combines a variety of elements that all contribute to the sacralization of kingship: the perfect body, the king’s superhuman size, and the demonstration of victorious action not in the alluvial plain but in the wilderness of the mountains. In the Victory Stele, these tropes are supplemented with the horned crown, which signals the divine status of the king (fig. 12). This visual icon is further complemented by the writing of the king’s name with the divine determinative in the inscription. The Victory Stele thus serves as a visual expression of the new conception of kingship,219 standing at the historical juncture between an era of independent city states and an era of unified empire and centralized kingship. Before the Akkad period, kingship had been conceived of in “limited terms and within the local structure of the city-state,” but it “now came to be defined as sovereign power.”220 The text of the Victory Stele, reporting on the historical defeat of the Lullubi mountain tribes, can also be read on a mythic level as narrating the royal victory over the disruptive forces of chaos.221 By means of such steles, as well as through sculptures and rock carvings that were always combined with historical narratives of their conquests, the kings of Akkad in a very material way appropriated and demarcated the space of their empire. This pictorial materiality served to proclaim their presence and their claim of control over a specific territory. Narām-Sîn’s rock carving at Pir Hüsein at the Tigris tunnel (fig. 13) can be interpreted as precisely such a declaration of presence, rather than as a symbol of actual control over the region. The cultural technique of indexing royal presence in the ‘four corners of the world,’ developed by the kings of Akkad, became part of the repertoire of topoi incorporated into the foundational myths of kingship, in which it appears in the guise of the rebellion theme.222 As a topos, the indexing of royal presence in the ‘four corners of the world’ also surfaces in the inscriptions of the kings of Akkad and in their legendary tradition, and later reappears as one of the most important strategies adopted in the royal inscriptions of Assyrian kings. The driving impetus behind this strategy, namely the alignment of the known
219 Why some scholars want to read the DINGIR category marker as a logogram for ilum ‘god’ and thus introduce a distinction in the act of divinizing between the deified king and other deified entities such as statues, steles, cultic paraphernalia etc. remains opaque to me, see the recent discussion by Král 2010. 220 Bahrani 2008, 102. 221 Westenholz 2000a, 102. 222 See the expression “when the four quarters rebelled against him” (Frayne, RIME 2, E2.1.4.3 iii 15‒18 = Wilcke ZA 87 24 J ix 13‒17; Frayne, RIME 2, E2.1.4.3 iii 27 = Wilcke ZA 87 25 J ix 26‒30; Frayne, RIME 2, E2.1.4.8 ii 1′‒5′; p. 138, RIME 2, E2.11.4.28:9‒13; p. 140, E2.11.4.29:57 collected by Westenholz 2000a, 107).

boundaries of the universe with the boundaries of empire, will be discussed at greater length in Chapter Four. Because the royal inscriptions of the kings of Akkad were studied and copied by Old Babylonian scribes, they became part of a supra-regional cultural heritage. In this context, King Sargon was integrated into the Babylonian textual tradition as the successful founder of a new dynasty, while his grandson Narām-Sîn was presented as the prototype of the Unheilsherrscher who, in his hubris, challenged the gods themselves, and ultimately provoked the demise of the empire.223 This paradigm only changed with the production of texts like the Weidner Chronicle. As is discussed in Chapter Eight, the survival of so few cultural texts from the Old Akkadian period is mitigated by the fact that the kings of Akkad entered the Old Babylonian stream of tradition on account of their great political achievements.224 The kings of Akkad also marked the high point of the literarization of the figure of the king. Many legends relate to two kings of Akkad in particular, namely Sargon and Narām-Sîn. Episodes from the lives of these kings constitute an ideal setting for the politically motivated utilization of history and aid in the establishment of continuity with the past. Moreover, the king is conceived of as “an artisan of human experience,”225 a paradigmatic figure at the crossroads between private history and cultural history. Legends of the kings of Akkad surviving in copies from the Old Akkadian, Old Babylonian, and later periods attest to the overall perception that these kings had created a “new type of charismatic kingship.”226 This monarchic template shaped the ideologies of the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and even later empires in a process of translatio imperii,227 reinforcing the place of combat as the primary strategy for empire-building. Once this paradigm took hold, all subsequent rebellions against the king could be and were regarded as infringements of the boundaries of the empire and, correspondingly, as disruptions of and rebellions against the cosmic order. The discovery of a composition about Sargon of Akkad among mercantile texts in a private house at the kārum of Kaneš represents a rare indication of the appropriation of Akkadian tradition by the city of Aššur,

As I learned from Gonzalo Rubio, the most famous early use of this concept is from Otto Frisingensis (12th cent.), who applied it to the Heilige Römische Reich, see Whaley 2012, 17 ff.



88 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and Traditions in Mesopotamia
whence it journeyed deep into Anatolia during the early second millennium BCE. In the legends of the kings of Akkad the topos of salutary accounts of hardship is closely linked with the topos of the king’s normative behavior. This normative behavior is reflected in the king’s relationship with the gods, as is observed critically in the Curse of Akkad and in the Cuthean Legend. In the Mesopotamian weltanschauung any failure of the ruler to pay due attention to the gods could provoke their wrath and lead them to abandon their cities, which left these cities bereft of divine protection and vulnerable to enemy invasion. This theological explanation of political crisis dominates the literary compositions of the Curse of Akkad228 and the Sumerian City Lament, both of which are related to the collapse of the Ur III empire.229 It also demonstrates again the close link between the king’s actions and the welfare of his country, the latter represented by its constituents, the city states. Moreover, this explanation of political crisis is integrated into the scholarly genres of chronicles230 and omen literature, the latter of which includes references to some of the omens reportedly recorded under the kings of Akkad.231 By the Old Babylonian period Akkad had developed “into the paradigm or, better, the prototype, for future dynasties in 1) its scope and power, through the unification of Babylonia and control of the periphery; 2) its elaboration of an imperial bureaucracy; and 3) its new conception of royalty.”232 Fascination with the kings of Akkad endured into the Neo-Assyrian period and beyond, as is apparent from the content of the library of Kiṣir-Aššur, chief exorcist of the Aššur temple during the reign of Ashurbanipal.233 In addition to a host of scholarly texts, Kiṣir-Aššur’s library contained the Weidner Chronicle, Sargon’s Report on his 8th Campaign, and Sargon’s Geography, which describes the creation of an imaginary empire of nearly cosmological dimensions under Sargon of Akkad, the namesake of the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II. Although there was a deliberate effort to introduce Akkadian as a language of prestige under Sargon of Akkad, many official inscriptions were written in Sumerian or as bilinguals. This suggests that the established scholarly circles of Sumer retained their position alongside the newly developing scholarly elite at the royal court of Akkad. It is only towards the end of the Old Akkadian

period that the Akkadian language becomes the primary vehicle of expression in texts. Following the disintegration of the empire of Akkad, Gutian rulers continued using Akkadian, while the kings of the Ur III period reverted to the use of the prestigious Sumerian language.
2.7 The Transformation of Tradition During the Ur III Period
The Old Babylonian historiographical tradition centered on the kings of Akkad is only one element in Assyrian historiography. Literarization of the kings of Akkad constitutes another important element, but it is not preserved as a distinct text genre. Instead, this literarization is manifest as a reservoir of tropes utilized in the construction of the image of kingship. The royal self-praise genre from the Ur III234 and the early Old Babylonian periods, for instance, perpetuated and perfected a tradition that originated in the Early Dynastic period.235 Of central importance are those tropes that depict kings and divinities in league with one another, legitimizing kingship through the intimate association of the king with the divine world – a practice best attested for the pantheon of Uruk, to which the Ur III kings frequently referred because Uruk was the ancestral home of their dynasty.236 The idea that a living king should pay close attention to the written legacy of his predecessors, a notion that figures prominently in the Cuthean Legend, is attested for the first time in Šulgi’s self-praise:
Because of my extraordinary wisdom and my ancient fame as a master, he should choose my hymns as example, and himself beget heavenly writings (mul-an).237
Since only one known manuscript of Ur III royal hymns actually dates to the Ur III period,238 it is difficult to tell whether this topos was original to the literarization of the king during the Ur III period or whether it was introduced as part of the Old Babylonian redaction of Ur III hymns. Evidence of Ur III literary

90 The Dynamics of Cultural Regions and Traditions in Mesopotamia
compositions is scanty, but the existence of several Ur III literary catalogues listing incipits of compositions – including two royal hymns of Šulgi and UrNamma respectively239 – suggests that there was a full-fledged body of cultural texts that re-invented the image of the king during the Ur III period. This reinvention and transformation of tradition is documented under King Šulgi of Ur, who had to overcome a crisis caused by the death in battle of Ur-Namma, the founder of the dynasty. As Piotr Michalowski writes:
The centralized, patrimonial state run from Ur required a well-regulated and well-trained bureaucracy that could be held accountable for all fiscal and organizational activities. Writing was the instrument by which the Crown exercised oversight and control, as documented by the hundred thousand or so published administrative documents from the period. The heads and minds of these literate servants had to be molded through schooling that not only taught them writing skills but also indoctrinated them into the ideological aspirations of the new state. Although contemporary evidence is still sparse, it appears that sometime under Shulgi the masters of the royal academies literally wiped clean the literary slate and discarded all but a few of the old compositions that went back to Early Dynastic times, that is more than half a millennium earlier. They kept most of the pedagogical tools such as word lists, but discarded virtually all the old narratives, replacing them with materials written in honor of the contemporary ruling house.240
Šulgi’s foundation of ‘academies’ is mentioned in his self-praise Šulgi B, the introduction of which also states that he was educated in the Sumerian and Akkadian textual tradition in the e2-dub-ba:
11‒20 I am a king, offspring begotten by a king and borne by a queen. I, Šulgi the noble, have been blessed with a favorable destiny from the womb. When I was small, I was at the academy, where I learned the scribal art from the tablets of Sumer and Akkad. None of the nobles could write on clay as I could. There where people regularly went for tutelage in the scribal art, I qualified full in subtraction, addition, reckoning and accounting. The fair Nanibgal, Nisaba, provided me amply with knowledge and comprehension. I am an experienced scribe who does not neglect a thing.
In the same self-praise, Šulgi boasts not only of his military training and hunting prowess, but also of his knowledge of extispicy, of his skill in music, and of his mastery of five languages.241 The passage of Šulgi B pertaining to the foundation of academies in Ur and Nippur is as follows:
308‒319 In the south, in Ur, I cause a House of Wisdom of Nisaba to spring up in sacrosanct ground for the writing of my hymns; up country in Nippur I established another.

The Transformation of Tradition During the Ur III Period 91
May the scribe be on duty there and transcribe with his hand the prayers which I instituted in the E-kur; and may the singer perform, reciting from the text. The academies are never to be altered; the place of learning shall never cease to exist. This and this only is now my accumulated knowledge! The collected words of all the hymns that are in my honor supersede all other formulations. By An, Enlil, Utu and Inanna, it is no lie – it is true!
The reference to the establishment of academies “for the writing of my hymns” once again points to the potential for interaction between scholars and the king. Šulgi’s foundation of academies was centered on the cities of Nippur and Ur, the respective religious and political capitals of the Ur III period. The Ur III scholarly tradition was preserved into the Old Babylonian period in the institution of the academy (e2-dub-ba), where textual standardization is likely to have begun.242 Old Babylonian academies appear to have been located in private houses, which are attested archaeologically in Nippur, Sippar-Amnanum, Tell ed-Der, Ur, and Meturan.243 The significance of the city of Meturan to the transmission of the stream of tradition is discussed in more depth in Chapter Three. This chapter has outlined the origins of a scholarly discourse centered on the figure of the king. Discourse of this kind is recoverable for the first time with the emergence of writing in the Uruk IV period toward the end of the fourth millennium BCE, and a continuous tradition is evident through to the emergence of the first empires during the Akkad and Ur III periods. The iconography of artifacts such as the Uruk Vase and the Lion Hunt Stele points to a body of experts concerned with shaping the royal image, which develops substantially during the Early Dynastic period (2900‒2350 BCE). Artifacts such as Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures from the Early Dynastic IIIb period (2500‒2340 BCE) advanced the notion of the warrior as leader figure, in both the divine and the human realm. The spread of cuneiform writing during the Early Dynastic period involved the diffusion of lexical and literary texts from the south into the north, where a local scholarly tradition was emerging, as is apparent in political centers such as Kiš, Ebla, Tell Brak, and Urkeš. Simultaneously, this
242 I use the category of standardization as opposed to canonization, which circumscribes a closed body of texts. See also critically Foster 2007, chapt. 1. For the Old Babylonian textual standardization of Sumerian literature see Rubio 2009. 243 Vanstiphout 1995; Veldhuis 1997; Tinney 1999; Robson 2001; Rubio 2009, 39‒42; Robson 2011. While the body of knowledge written in the Sumerian language survived in the institution of the Old Babylonian edubba, the late Old Babylonian tablets from Dūr-Abiešuh provide evidence for the emergence of a specifically Akkadian written tradition that maintained “close connections to the intellectual traditions of Nippur but displays a marked proclivity for writing in Akkadian.” (George 2009, 149).

northern Syrian horizon was interacting with Hurrian tradition, which represents an important cultural element in the piedmont region of northern Mesopotamia. During the Old Akkadian, Ur III, and Old Assyrian periods, the Sumero-Babylonian and Syro-Hurrian traditions both contributed to the development of a cultural discourse in Aššur and in the larger Tigridian area, including Ešnunna and Tigunānum. This will be demonstrated in the next chapter. Focusing on the third millennium represents an attempt to demonstrate the cosmopolitan nature of scholarship from the very beginning. It also illuminates why in later periods Assyrian kings could so easily turn to a rich tapestry of traditions from which to weave their particular ideological discourse, as happened in the Middle Assyrian period, when Assyria first became a territorial state.



3 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
3.1 Where to Begin?
Where and when can we first locate a specifically Assyrian ideological discourse? Who can we identify as its ‘founding father(s)’? The perspective of the modern historiographer of the ancient Near East has been greatly distorted by the evidence of the later territorial and imperial states, which were characterized by a cultural and political center. Traditional histories of Assyria typically begin in the second rather than in the third millennium BCE, thereby separating the city of Aššur’s history as a center of trade during the Old Assyrian period from Assyria’s history as a territorial state in later periods.1 Consequently, the emergence of a particularly Assyrian cultural discourse is said to begin only when the former city state Aššur developed into a territorial state during the Middle Assyrian period in the second half of the second millennium BCE. This reconstruction of Assyrian history has persisted in part due to recent developments in the field of Assyriology. In recent decades, Assyriology has become increasingly fractured as research has focused on ever narrower fields of specialization. Research on Assyrian history has not been spared this phenomenon, becoming chronologically compartmentalized into studies on the Old, Middle and Neo-Assyrian periods. Resulting research has been informed by a correspondingly restricted interpretation of tradition. Further, research on Assyrian cultural discourse has been confined primarily to the literary texts. Because the city of Aššur produced almost no such texts,2 scholarly study of Assyria has instead been preoccupied with Assyria’s perceived historiographic tradition. Scholarship has largely ignored the ancients’ blurring of the ‘literary’ and the ‘historiographic’ texts and has focused on the annals for which imperial Assyria is famous.3 Regarding Mesopotamian literary tradition per se, scholars have been primarily concerned with trying to explain how this literary tradition – as expressed in tales of the kings of Akkad4 – spread through Mesopotamia, into Mari in Syria, and further afield into Anatolia. The purpose of such investigation was to determine whether the spread of tales of the kings of Akkad beyond Mesopotamia was a consequence of the direct presence of the Ak

kadian kings in Anatolia or whether it was necessary to posit channels of transmission either through the Hurrians or the Old Assyrians.5 In this approach, the Hurrians were considered creative in their adaptation of the Babylonian tradition because there is concrete textual evidence indicating such creativity.6 Aššur, however, was omitted from such analyses, because there is very little direct evidence for its early cultural discourse, which can be reconstructed only through a careful analysis of other surviving media. In this vein, because the earliest building inscriptions of the rulers of Aššur possess formal characteristics that show commonalities with royal inscriptions from the south, they have been categorized as typical Old Akkadian and Ur III inscriptions and, consequently, have been included in editions of the royal inscriptions of the kings of Akkad and the kings of the Ur III period.7 Yet the archaeological evidence demonstrates the existence of a flourishing and independent economic and cultic life in Aššur already during the Early Dynastic period, as is clear from the older layers of the Ištar Temple.8 This situation is also indicated by early inscriptions attesting to Aššur’s intermittent independence during the reigns of the Old Akkadian and Ur III kings. Despite this important evidence, scholarship has tended to approach Aššur’s history as if it began only in the first centuries of the second millennium BCE, “when it exhibited a set of distinctive features in the areas of political institutions, economic structures, law, religion, language, and art, which set it off from the preceding Ur III empire, contemporary Babylonia and the following Middle Assyrian period.”9 The situation was, however, much more fluid during the third and first half of the second millennium BCE, when cities rose to prominence primarily on the basis of their economically strategic locations within the commercial networks that crisscrossed the ancient Near East in general, and northern Mesopotamia – notably Ešnunna, Mari, Aššur, Ekallatum, Emar, and Carchemish – in particular.10 The recent finds of Tigunānum11 seem to indicate that one has to add this city to the list of major centers in the Northern Syrian and Tigridian region. Aššur emerged as one ‘center’ alongside others, constituting a node in the dynamic network of cultural interaction that linked Amorites, Hurrians and Babylonians. Due to the archaizing Old Akkadian features of the

Old Assyrian language, Aššur has not generally been regarded as subject to the Babylonization of written culture in Upper Mesopotamia,12 while the terms ‘Akkadian’ and ‘Akkad’ have been understood merely as synonyms for the cities of Ešnunna and Babylon.13 In a recent study of Ešnunna’s role in the formation of scribal tradition in Mari, the Middle Euphrates, and Upper Mesopotamia, Dominique Charpin suggests that the term ‘Babylonization’ should be replaced with ‘Akkadization,’ since this process started in the period of Ešnunna’s emerging supremacy under its king Narām-Sîn.14 This ambitious king clearly emulated Akkadian tradition as is demonstrated by his choice of the name Narām-Sîn, which, like that of his illustrious Akkadian namesake, was preceded by the determinative for ‘god’ (dingir). As is stressed by Charpin, the Akkadization of scribal practice did not, however, follow the southern Babylonian model represented by Babylon and Larsa,15 but seems to have originated in Ešnunna itself. In Mari this modernizing of scribal practice included changes in tablet shape, in paleography, in the syllabary, in the use of ideograms, and in the notation of numbers and measures. According to Charpin, widespread literacy in Aššur suggests that the city firmly resisted such scribal reforms, but it could equally be said that the correspondence of merchants and scholarly production at the court represent two different aspects of the scribal world. Traces of Akkadization are apparent in the inscriptions of Šamšī-Adad I16 and in his diplomatic correspondence,17 which points either to the presence of Ešnunnean scholars at his court or at least to the exposure of his scribes to Ešnunnean scribal tradition. Akkadization implied not only linguistic change but also the adoption of typical features of Old Akkadian royal ideology, as I will demonstrate in this chapter. As is clear from the process of Akkadization, Ešnunna played a central role in the transmission of Sumero-Babylonian culture to the west, and, as I would like to suggest, to the north. It is worth noting in this regard that the Akkadian written at Old Babylonian Alalakh, which had a strong Hurrian presence, shares features with Old Akkadian.18 Other linguistic features like the shift

from n > l as attested in the Old Assyrian/Middle Assyrian month name kanwarta/kalmarte have been considered a shared linguistic feature of Old Assyrian, Hurrian, Proto-Hattic, and Hittite,19 supporting the idea that there was a common linguistic horizon in the north that might – with all due caution – reflect a distinct cultural horizon.20 This chapter will therefore attempt to reveal how the cities of northern Mesopotamia and northern Syria defined their own cultural identity in light of their indebtedness to the Akkad model, both during and in the period following the Akkadian empire. The following investigation, rather than locating the beginnings of Assyrian ideological discourse at any one moment in history, seeks to lay bare the dynamics of a longue durée inextricably bound up in Aššur’s various roles as a trading station, an outpost at the frontiers of the empires of the Old Akkadian and Ur III periods,21 a city state of the Old Assyrian period, and, under ŠamšīAdad I (1808‒1776 BCE), an important cultic center in a large territorial state.
3.2 The Early History of the City of Aššur
Due to its strategic location as a gateway to the fertile alluvial plain of the south and as a node in the trade route linking the Taurus region through Ešnunna with Der,22 the city of Aššur was one of the earliest prosperous settlements in the north. This is evident in Aššur’s ceramic history, which begins in the sixth or fifth millennium BCE while stone vessels date to the Uruk period (fig. 14). By the later Early Dynastic period, Aššur’s economic wealth was based on its commercial role and translated directly into a flourishing cult, as confirmed by the early Ištar temples.23 Finds from the early strata of the Ištar temple include an Early Dynastic seal that in its material composition and iconography links Aššur with the regions of the Diyala and the Hamrin (fig. 15).24 Similarly, numerous praying figures25 and censers point to connections with the cultural horizons of the Diyala region and Mari. The Early Dynastic finds also included a relief plaque showing a female figure (fig. 16), perhaps Ištar,26

and a cylinder seal that in its iconography links Aššur with Tell Brak (fig. 17).27 A bead assemblage from the Archaic Ištar temple G with quadruple-spiral beads and etched carnelian indicates contacts with the trade routes connecting India to Anatolia “and closely resembles jewellery recovered from sites in southern Mesopotamia.”28 The sealing of an entu-priestess is still another sign of the importance of the Ištar temple (fig. 18) during the late Ur III period. Remains of archaeological strata under the stratum dating to the reign of Šamšī-Adad I in the area of the Old Palace confirm the existence of an official building that might have functioned as a palace already by the late Early Dynastic period or early Old Akkadian period at the latest.29 Old Akkadian tablets carrying the excavation number Ass. 19492 confirm this dating; accordingly, the earliest strata comprised several layers from the Akkad period and perhaps one that dates back into the Early Dynastic period.30 Aššur is not mentioned in the royal inscriptions of the kings of Akkad, who only refer to Subartu, the later homeland of Assyria. This lack of written evidence is due to the fact that the Old Akkadian texts from Aššur, which include economic and school texts, have not yet been published.31 It should be mentioned, however, that some of the school tablets represent word lists that contain not only Sumerograms but also Akkadian words. This led Aage Westenholz to assume that they repre

sented the beginning of an Akkadian lexical tradition that was discontinued when the Akkadian empire collapsed.32 The level directly beneath Šamšī-Adad I’s Old Palace, known as the courtyard of the so-called Schotterhofbau, has been dated to the Old Assyrian period on the basis of fragments of clay tablets, envelopes, seal impressions, and a lentil-shaped exercise tablet. Bricks with the name of Erišum I have been recovered from the mud debris separating this level from Šamšī-Adad I’s Old Palace,33 attesting to Erišum I’s intention to make a representational statement regarding his function as ruler of the city. This casts a different light on the nature of kingship in Aššur than does the correspondence of the merchants of the Old Assyrian period. Inscriptions of Erišum have been also found in Kaneš

and must probably be seen in the context of other school tablets found at the merchant center. Enough school tablets have been found to assume some kind of scribal training that must have occurred in some kind of cooperation with the one performed in the city of Aššur as attested by a duplicate.34 The texts from Kaneš included literary texts, a love charm, a Lamaštu incantation and other incantations, letters and other texts related to commercial activities.35 All of this archaeological data implies that Aššur functioned as a trade hub very early on, connecting Elam, Babylonia, and Anatolia and facilitating the long-range exchange of precious metals and textiles. Aššur occupied this position even before the Old Assyrian period, when precisely such a role is securely documented in the archives of Kaneš/Kültepe. The antiquity of Aššur’s role as a center of trade points to firmly established political and economic structures. In turn, Aššur’s long history of trade explains the close relationship between the god Aššur and the City Hall (bīt ālim), the function of the latter being primarily economic,36 as is clear from the Old Assyrian letters. During the Old Akkadian and Ur III periods Aššur’s phases of independence were temporary and short-lived, and some elements of the early inscriptions reflect southern traditions. Nevertheless, the choices made by the local rulers or governors of Aššur regarding the introduction and fostering of particular cults and the choice of specific titles in their celebratory inscriptions suggest their active participation in and reception of an existing supra-regional cultural discourse. The same evidence also indicates a deliberate attempt by the rulers of Aššur to define their own identity on their own terms, rather than a passive copying of existing traditions from the south. Judging by the scale of investment in building projects in Aššur during the Old Assyrian period and during the reign of Šamšī-Adad I – notably in structures like the Old Palace, the city walls, and the temples in Aššur – the city appears to have played a major role as cultural metropolis and seat of kingship during the Old Babylonian period, though this view has been questioned recently on the grounds that Ekallatum might have been Šamšī-Adad I’s base of operation before he chose Šubat-Enlil – formerly Šekhna – as his residence.37 It seems, however, that it was only toward the end of his reign that ŠamšīAdad I divided his territorial state into three blocs administered from three

102 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
strategic sites: Šubat-Enlil, his own newly founded capital in the Hābūr Basin, Ekallatum, located just north of Aššur, and Mari, an important trade station on the route from Babylonia to northwestern Syria. As discussed further below, Aššur’s Old Palace and some of its most important temples were the beneficiaries of major renovation work under Šamšī-Adad I, implying that in the beginning of his reign Aššur must have been more than merely a ceremonial center for this king. Investigating Assyrian ideological discourse from a diachronic perspective reveals its complexity: the future Assyrian empire may have grown out of a city state, but this city also served as an important outpost of the Akkadian and Ur III empires. During the early periods of Aššur’s existence, the city of Nineveh – located further north on the east bank of the Tigris at the site of a key river crossing seems to have had a strongly Hurrianized population and been largely independent of the south. In recent years the question of Akkadian control of Nineveh has been disputed, and even Maništušu’s building activities in the Ištar temple of Nineveh have been cast into doubt.38 The sparse textual evidence from the Ur III period, including the visit of the local king Tiš-atal of Nineveh to Ešnunna39 during the reign of Šu-Sîn and expenditures recorded in Ur for messengers or ambassadors from the states of Šimanum and Nineveh,40 argue in favor of Nineveh’s geo-political status as a Hurrian principality. This perception is reinforced by the status of the Hurrian Ištar-Šauška as Nineveh’s patron deity, which further marks its cultural identity as Hurrian. If Nineveh was identical with the city of Ninet, a sanctuary of a goddess Eštar that is mentioned in the archives of Mari, then this same goddess was also venerated in the palace of Mari at the end of the reign of Yasmah-Adad.41 Nineveh’s strategic location and importance as a former seat of Hurrian rulers made it a highly desirable target for the expansionist vision of Šamšī-Adad I. The formation of the Assyrian state and the development of its cultural discourse in general and its royal ideology in particular were based on local as well as ‘supra-regional’ political, economic, and social structures. Nowhere is this complex discourse more apparent than in the attempt to combine multiple different traditions in the Assyrian King List (AKL), which begins with the ‘17 kings who lived in tents’ – thus connecting the city with an Amorite past an

chored in a more mobile lifestyle – and concomitantly appropriating Aššur as the historic seat of kingship.42
3.3 Socio-Political Organization: North versus South
When approaching the subject of Assyrian identity, it is necessary to be mindful of the fact that some of the differences in the social organization of northern and southern Mesopotamia reflect actual ecological differences between the two regions.43 Although kings in northern Mesopotamia and in northwestern Syria controlled much wealth and a large expanse of land, their power was “balanced by the council of the city elders and family members, in a pattern also characteristic of a ‘tribal type of society.’”44 Such patterns are evident in the various Early Dynastic archives of Ebla, Nagar/Tell Brak, and Nabada/Tell Beydar in the Hābūr Basin. Furthermore, it seems that the polities that formed part of the kingdom of Nagar remained to some extent economically autonomous and were responsible only for certain tasks, such as feeding the donkeys of the ruler when he travelled through the area. The retention of economic autonomy is additionally apparent in the fact that the leaders of these smaller polities could receive gifts directly from a foreign ruler; gift-giving was not always channeled through the king of Nagar for redistribution.45 During the Early Dynastic period there were several major centers in the Jazira, among them ancient Šekhna/Tell Leilan and Urkeš/Tell Mozan, which controlled polities in competition with Nagar. Although no texts from the Early Dynastic period survive from Aššur, the later Old Assyrian archives of the 19th and 18th centuries BCE attest to a social organization comparable to that of other northern Mesopotamian and northern Syrian polities, as there is a similar distribution of power between the city assembly (ālum), the eponym (limmum), and the city ruler (rubāʾum), the latter a title also used by the rulers of Ešnunna. In this framework, the occasionally attested ‘Elders’ (šībūtu) were probably part of the city assembly or represented it in some capacity,46 while the ruler was the primus inter pares and ‘overseer’ (PA/waklum) of the community of the city.47 Judicial and presumably other ad

104 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
ministrative affairs were overseen in close cooperation between the ruler and the city assembly. The city assembly was the highest judicial authority and functioned as a court of law, but could also make political decisions relating to trade and to the distribution of costs for the fortification of the city. It could issue commands (awātum ‘word’) and some of its decrees could turn into general rulings (awâtum, pl.) which were then inscribed on a stela (awât naruʾāʾim).48
Old Assyrian letters clearly indicate that political leadership in Old Assyrian Aššur was shared between various bodies, but this is not true for the royal inscriptions of that period, which represent the king in his exclusive position with regard to the god Aššur. The divergent evidence for Aššur’s political organization reflected in the letters of merchant families on the one hand and in the royal inscriptions on the other demonstrates that the ruler’s ideological claim of a monopoly over executive power cannot be accepted prima facie. Instead, as already pointed out in Chapter One, the king relied on a host of courtiers, officials, scribes, and diviners to ensure effective governance.49 The Archaic List of Professions from Uruk50 reveals a complex social structure, yet the political organization known for Aššur is not observable in the Sumerian city states of the south. In southern Mesopotamia, palace and temple both represented wealthy, economically privileged households, as is demonstrated by their architecture and administrative documents. Even cooperative institutional bodies, as represented in the archaic city seals indicating regular deliveries to the temple of Inanna in Uruk during the Jemdet Nasr period, do not necessarily imply the independence of the temple from the ruler in the city of Uruk.51 In the Archaic List of Professions, the namešda sits atop the social ladder followed by a vizier, indicating an early tendency toward a strongly pyramidic social structure.52 During the Early Dynastic III period, Enmetena and Uru-ʾinimgina, rulers of the city state of Lagaš, decree freedom from debt slavery and corvée labor.53 These decrees point to centralized control, and the Reforms of Uru-ʾinimgina indeed make clear that the palace controlled, or at least had access to, the resources of the temple.54 As such, southern Mesopota

Third Millennium Ideological Discourse in Aššur 105
mian society appears to have been strongly hierarchical with power concentrated in the hands of a single ruler already in the Early Dynastic period. The essential roles and key metaphors that would govern royal ideology in the future history of the ancient Near East had at this point been established in southern Mesopotamia: the king as war leader, the king as hunter, and the king as caretaker of the temple. Differences in social organization influenced the early monumental and ideological self-representation of kings, which had not yet emerged in third millennium northern Mesopotamia. Instead, above ground elite burials involving numerous people emphasize the importance of lineage in the north, typical of a society organized along tribal lines.55 Because urbanism was a secondary development in northern Mesopotamia that arose in response to the growth of cities in the south, “northern kings borrowed the ideological trappings and administrative technologies of southern kingship and southern state societies – palaces, cylinder seals, writing, and royal iconography – although all these were translated into local forms and presumably into local systems of meaning as well.”56
3.4 Third Millennium Ideological Discourse in Aššur
No inscriptions from the Early Dynastic period have been recovered in Aššur and only a few inscriptions hint at the ideological discourse that developed during the Old Akkadian period (ca. 2350‒2200 BCE). This group includes votive inscriptions, building inscriptions, and inscriptions on sealings, which, beyond the titulary, provide little historical information. Nevertheless, these few inscriptions reveal the roots of an Assyrian ideological discourse predicated on the establishment of alliances with divine figures, particularly with the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar in her various hypostases. Among the early building inscriptions is a votive plaque originally written by Ititi that was secondarily placed in the Ištar temple built by Tukultī-Ninurta I. In this inscription, Ititi reports that he dedicated the votive plaque in question to the goddess Ištar as part of the war booty he acquired following his victory over Gasur. Accordingly, Ititi’s inscription happens to be early evidence of Aššur’s interaction – in this case by means of military confrontation – with a city that formed part of the Hurrian cultural horizon but might at that time

This inscription points to the importance of the goddess Ištar to the ruler. Ititi’s description of himself as ‘son of Ininlaba,’ however, also reveals an interest in genealogy and in identification with individual predecessors. Ininlaba’s name – ‘Innin/Ištar is a lion’ – in turn demonstrates that the strong bond between the ruler and the goddess Ištar enjoyed a long pedigree. Indeed, the name Ininlaba is “also found in documents from contemporary Gasur, and paralleled in other Old Akkadian names such as Aštar-laba, Šî-laba, and Šî-labʾat, meaning ‘Ištar is a lion’, ‘She is a lion’, and ‘She is a lioness.’”59 Ititi’s genealogical reference implies a claim to rule based on ancestral line and thus indicates a royal outlook that is very different from the one advanced in the Sumerian King List in the south – of which one fragment dates to the Ur III period60 in which particular stress is laid on the rotation of hegemonic rule among the city states rather than on the rise and fall of individual dynasties.61 Ititi’s title in the votive plaque inscription is pa, which used to be read as an abbreviation of the Sumerian title pa.te.si = ensi2= Akkadian iššiʾakkum, a designation that referred to a provincial governor under the kings of Akkad. In Aššur, the title ensi2, however, only occurs in the construct with the name of the god Aššur, and so, in Ititi’s inscription the reading pa = ugula/waklum is to be preferred.62 This title served as the self-designation of the rulers of Aššur

as long as the city state of Aššur was independent.63 The title ugula/waklum denoted the ruler’s status relative to the community of Aššur, qualifying him as ‘administrator of the City’ and as ‘overseer of the community’, while the title ensi2/iššiakkum, which is attested in official seals and inscriptions, referred to the ruler’s relationship with the god Aššur. The title ugula/waklum was still in use under Adad-nīrārī I (1295‒1264 BCE) and Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE), and inscriptions of the latter show that the title šid/iššiʾakku could be used interchangeably in the same context.64 Although use of the title ensi2in the political arena indicated dependency on the Akkadian overlord during the Old Akkadian period, the title first appears as a designation for the city ruler in the inscriptions of the kings of pre-Sargonic Lagaš, a city-state in southern Mesopotamia that encompassed a number of distinct towns.65 In Lagaš, the administrative character of the title ensi2is apparent in the epithet ensi-2galdNingirsu, which refers to the king’s relationship with the patron deity. The same is true for the epithet ‘given power by Enlil’ (á-sum-ma-den-líl), which is found in the inscriptions of Enannatum. Although Eannatum and Entemena refer to themselves exclusively with the title ensi2, they relate that they obtained kingship (nam-lugal) from a deity.66 Toward the end of the third millennium the ruler Gudea continued to designate himself “steward” (ensi2) of Lagaš, stressing his stewardship vis-à-vis the patron deity of the city.67 The ideological discourse of these kings of Lagaš is typical of the Tigridian area and suggests that Lagaš forms part of a greater region of cultural unity that stretches north from Lagaš to Ešnunna and Aššur. This view is supported both by the exclusion of the dynasty of Lagaš from the Sumerian King List and by the fact that the scholars of Lagaš were sufficiently self-confident to compose their own king list.68 After he brought the city states of the south under his control, Lugalzagesi referred to himself as ensi2-gal den-líl.69 This epithet was then adopted by king Sargon of Akkad, who defeated Lugalzagesi and built the empire of Akkad.70

108 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
The epithet ensi2 dEnlil thus expressed the king’s direct accountability to Enlil, the chief god of the Sumerian pantheon, and did not entail that the ruler who adopted it relinquish the title ‘king’ (lugal) in relation to a particular city or to the land in general (lugal kalam-ma).71 This same notion can be observed for the cities of Ešnunna and Aššur, where the city ruler was designated as the ‘vice-regent’ or ‘steward’ (ensi2/iššiʾakku) of the patron deity of the city. In Aššur, the ruler was vice-regent of the god Aššur while Aššur himself, written (d)Aššur(ki), was called ‘king’ (lugal/šarrum). In Ešnunna, on the other hand, the ruler is referred to as ‘beloved of Tišpak, steward of Ešnunna’ (nāram dTišpak iššiʾak Ašnunnaki). This theocratic approach to kingship is further apparent in the fact that political authority continued to be associated with the epithet ‘House of Tišpak and the Prince,’72 used to refer to both the god and the king. The broad similarity between the royal discourse of the rulers of Ešnunna and the rulers of Aššur is especially clear in the wording of their respective sealings. Indeed, the sealings of Šuilīya, a local ruler of Ešnunna at the time of the Ur III king Ibbi-Sîn, and of Kirikiri, ruler of Ešnunna during the early Isin period, attribute the epithets ‘strong king’ and ‘king of the four banks’ to the god Tišpak. This is interesting because these epithets are known from the titularies of the kings of Akkad, but are here applied to a deity with whom the king is depicted in a subordinate relationship:73

Kirikiri’s son Bilalama expresses the relationship between god and ruler differently in the standard inscription of his stamped bricks, in which he emphasizes Tišpak’s divine support as the basis of his empowerment. This position is articulated by means of the trope of love, conveying a relationship of mutual obligation between the deity and the king:

3 dTišpak of the god Tišpak, 4 ÉNSI steward 5 áš-nun-na.KI of Ešnunna.
Ešnunna represents the southernmost point of Hurrian penetration, which might explain Tišpak’s position as the patron deity of Ešnunna. The Hurrian deity Tišpak, associated with the weather god Tešub, had replaced the local deity Ninazu as early as the Old Akkadian Period.77 Several seal impressions of a certain Ṣilulu, perhaps to be equated with Sulilu of the Assyrian King List, were found at Kültepe and demonstrate a theo

cratic understanding of rulership in the Assyrian cultural horizon that is similar to that of Ešnunna. These seal impressions also emphasize the equation of the city as a community with the eponymous god through the writing Aššur.KI instead of dAššur and the positioning of the king’s filiation.

The imagery of Ṣilulu’s seal is interesting insofar as it shows a hero-like figure trampling over a naked enemy, which is reminiscent of the imagery of NaramSîn’s victory stele.79 Whether the trampling figure represents a divinity – perhaps Aššur – or the ruler is hard to determine. Be that as it may, the imagery differs clearly from later Old Assyrian royal seals that adopted the ‘presentation scene’ typical of the Ur III period, albeit with a probable change in meaning, as the ruler was represented as the standing figure being led by a lamma-deity into the presence of the seated Aššur.80 In line with Old Assyrian tradition,81 Šamšī-Adad I also chose this kind of formula to express the direct bond between Aššur and the ruler in his own seal.82 Šamšī-Adad I’s interest in publicizing his genealogy should also be noted in this respect:
Seal of Šamšī-Adad I83

The inscriptions on Šamšī-Adad I’s seals are typically Tigridian in their style, but the iconography of the audience scene in the seals is not. On his seals,

Fig. 19: Seal of Šamšī-Adad I (Porada 1980, fig. III-1 a).
Šamšī-Adad I is depicted in Babylonian style with the typical Babylonian brimmed cap and beard, dressed in a long robe that leaves his right shoulder bare;84 this imagery is reminiscent of that employed by his younger contemporary Hammurabi. The combination of Tigridian inscription and Babylonian iconography on Šamšī-Adad I’s seals reflects his broad geographical and cultural horizons with his scholars being conversant in a variety of traditions (fig. 19). In Aššur itself, the trope of the city ruler being the ‘vice-regent’ or ‘steward’ (ensi2/iššiʾakku) of the god Aššur – expressing the king’s accountability to the patron deity – was firmly established by the time of Šamšī-Adad I and dominated Assyrian ideology in various forms until the very end of the Assyrian empire.85 Actual kingship was reserved for the god Aššur. The titularies and inscriptions of the Old Assyrian rulers attest to the contracting of alliances with the divine world and are a direct reflection of the introduction of the cult of particular deities. Whether this cultic transfer occurred at the initiative of the Akkadian king or at the behest of the local ruler of Aššur cannot, of course, be determined. The integration of a specifically bellicose Ištar-hypostasis into the cult of Aššur, however, likely had consequences for cultic hierarchies and had a corresponding impact on ideological discourse. Of particular interest is an inscription written on a fragment of an alabastron dedicated to the Akkadian Ištar-Annunītu, indicating that her cult

had been introduced to the city of Aššur.86 The presence of Akkadians – and, consequently, Akkadian culture – is further supported by the discovery of a spearhead inscribed with the name of an individual who served under the Akkadian king Maništušu (2269‒2255 BCE).87 This spearhead was placed secondarily in the foundation of Ištar temple D of the Old Assyrian period. Ištar in her various aspects remained central to Assyrian rulership. During the Ur III period at the latest, the cult of Bēlat-ekallim, a goddess until then broadly venerated in southern Mesopotamia and otherwise known by her Sumerian equivalent Nin-egal, was introduced in Aššur under Zarriqum,88 the local governor of the Ur III king:
Inscription of Zarriqum89

Like other early inscriptions, this votive plaque was found in a secondary context in the Ištar-temple built by Tukultī-Ninurta I. Because the later sanctuaries dedicated to Ištar were dedicated to Ištar-Aššurītu, it has been assumed that Zarriqum’s building represented a chapel within that temple rather than an independent temple in its own right.90 Although the Zarriqum inscription is only a votive plaque and conveys nothing about Bēlat-ekallim’s actual role, the presence of her cult in Aššur is central to understanding Assyrian ideology. Bēlat-ekallim’s Sumerian hypostasis Nin-egal is known to have been equated with Inanna and played an important role in determining the destiny of the

king.91 The Sumerian ceremonial name É.KI.NAM = É ašar šīmāti attested in the Aššur Directory (Götteradressbuch)92 is reminiscent of this particular function, which Ištar assumed for the Assyrian king. The fact that Zarriqum designates himself as Amar-Sîn’s servant indicates that during this period Aššur was dependent on the Ur III court.93 The articulation of a programmatic royal discourse focusing on the ruler’s relationship with the gods – primarily Ištar and Aššur – is explicit in the inscriptions of the Puzur-Aššur dynasty of the Old Assyrian period. In his report on the construction of a temple for Ištar the ruler Ilu-šumma introduces himself with the following title:
Inscription of Ilušumma94
1 DINGIR-šu-ma Ilu-šumma, 2 ÉNSI steward 3 a-šu-ur.KI of Aššur, 4 na-ra-am beloved 5 da-šùr of Aššur 6 ù dINANNA and Ištar, 7 [mēra ša]lim-a-ḫu-um [son of Ša]lim-ahum, 8 ÉNSI steward 9 a-šu-ur.KI of Aššur, 10 a-na dINANNA (13) has built a temple for 11 NIN.A.NI Ištar, his lady, 12 a-na ba-la-ṭì-šu for his life. 13 É i-pu-uš
The adoption of the title ‘beloved of Ištar’ is clear evidence of the appropriation of Akkadian ideology in the titulary of the kings of Aššur. In Assyria, the concept of being the beloved of a certain god underwent a local transformation through its application to the local patron deity and its association with an alliance that bound the divine world with the king. Votive plaques from the preceding Ur III period dedicated to Ištar-Aššurītu95 indicate that it was probably during that time that the deity identified with the temple was redefined and Assyrianized: the Akkadian Ištar-Anunitu became the Assyrian Ištar-Aššurītu.

For a detailed summary of the building history of the early Ištar temples in Aššur see Meinhold 2009. 95 Meinhold 2009, 26.



114 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
As the Ur III state weakened progressively toward the end of the third millennium BCE, the opportunity arose for Aššur to revive its commercial role as a hub between Elam, Babylonia, and Anatolia, competing for primacy in this capacity with Ešnunna and Mari as well as Isin and Larsa. Aššur’s wide-ranging contacts are especially apparent in the inscriptions of Ilu-šumma and his successor Erišum I. One of Ilu-šumma’s two surviving inscriptions introduces three motifs central to royal ideology: the king as the overseer of the irrigation system essential for the subsistence of the city, the king’s measurement of house-plots for the people of Aššur, and the king’s function as guardian of Aššur’s position in inter-regional trade. With the exception of the motif of the king as custodian of the irrigation system, which was reintroduced during the Middle Assyrian period, these motifs were typical only for the Old Assyrian period and subsequently abandoned.96
A façade (and) new wall I constructed and subdivided house-plots for my city. The god Aššur opened for me two springs in Mount Abih and I made bricks for the wall by these two springs. The water of one spring flowed down to the Aušum Gate (while) the water of the other spring flowed down to the Wertum Gate. I established freedom of the Akkadians and their children. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur, Awal, and Kismar, Dēr of the god Ištaran, as far as the city (Aššur). (Meaning: I freed the Akkadians and their children from forced labor and cleared them of their obligations to pay copper as tax).97
While Ilu-šumma is the first ruler of Aššur to refer to geographical areas beyond Aššur, these references do not indicate Assyrian territorial control. Rather, they bespeak Aššur’s efforts to control the trade in tin, copper, and premium woolen textiles. Tin probably came from Iran and was supplied via Elam, copper originated in Oman and reached Aššur via Babylon, and premium woolen textiles were generally produced in southern Mesopotamia. The inscriptions of Ilu-šumma’s successor, King Erišum, attest to significant building activities in the area of both the Aššur temple and the Adad temple. Copies of two inscriptions, the originals of which were placed in the Aššur temple, survive in Kaneš on clay tablets.98 They are vital to understanding the administration of justice in the city of Aššur, which was performed at the mušlālum-gate in the presence of the seven Divine Judges. Of particular

interest is the textual insertion that links the two inscriptions. This insertion lists the Seven Judges, reflecting the emphasis in both of the inscriptions on the construction of the Step Gate and on its judicial function as a site for giving testimony and speaking the oath. Somehow, this tradition of the judges of the Aššur temple, established at the latest under Erišum, survived in the much later Götteraddressbuch99 and fragmentarily in the tākultu/banquet ritual, thus attesting to the longevity of certain traditions:100
Erišum Götteraddressbuch (GAB) (1) Mēšarum (‘Justice’) (34) Mīšaru (2) Išme-karāb (‘He heard the prayer’) (39) Išme-karāba (3) Ṣê-raggu (‘Get Out, Criminal!’) (40) Hip-raggu (‘Break the Criminal’) (4) Ulli-mēšaram (‘He Extolled Justice’) (34) (Distorted?’ to:) Il-Mīšarum (5) Ašur-ḫablam (‘Watch Over the (36) Ašra-killa (‘Watch Over the Downtrodden!’) Detention’) (6) Pûšu-kēn (‘His Speech is just’) (37) Pîšu-kēna (7) Išmēlum (‘God Has Heard’) (38) Išmēla (40) Il-padâ (‘God (of the) Sparing’) (40) Uṣur-pîšunu (‘Guard Their Word’) (41) Tišamme-pê-mukarribe (‘Listen to the Word of the Supplicant’)
The above survey of the royal inscriptions from third millennium Aššur demonstrates that the rulers of that city experimented with their self-representation. On the one hand, there was an emphasis on the central notion of accountability to the gods, which was primarily expressed through the king’s status as steward of the god Aššur. On the other hand, attempts were made to focus on the ruler’s direct interaction with the community of Aššur through such actions as ensuring an adequate water supply for the city, assigning living space to the people within Aššur’s urban landscape, and supervising trade. Tropes centered on the ruler’s relationship with his subjects reflect the position of Aššur’s ruler as a primus inter pares within the city community, a notion that vanished with Šamšī-Adad I and his ambitions for building a territorial state. Ištar’s central role in the cultic life of Aššur is evident by the Early Dynastic period, notably in the discovery in the Ištar temple of a relief plaque that depicts her naked in a frontal position, which is similar to her representation on the much later Hasanlu bowl.101 Finds from the Sumerian period in the same

116 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
temple prove that Ištar’s cult preceded the cult of the god Aššur by at least a millennium. In the Akkad period, texts hint at Ištar’s importance in the empowerment of the king, a trope that was later intensified through her adoption of the voice of Aššur and her transmission of divine commands in the form of oracles. Other tropes, including that of the king as protector of trade, simply disappear. Šamšī-Adad I’s vision of an Upper Mesopotamian kingdom resulted in a thorough reinvention of ideological discourse. Because Šamšī-Adad I’s ideological discourse incorporated all of the elements essential to an ideology of universal control, it became the blueprint for subsequent kings. Warfare replaced trade as a means for obtaining the surplus resources required to support extensive building programs in Aššur and the other Assyrian capitals, as well as for sustaining Assyria’s growing bureaucratic apparatus.

recent reconstruction, Šamšī-Adad I was of Amorite origin and his ancestors had settled in Akkad,104 becoming rivals of the kingdom of Ešnunna. Under the expansionist politics of Ipiq-Adad II and Narām-Sîn, Šamšī-Adad I was expelled from Akkad (Chronological Table); from his exile in Babylon he conquered Ekallatum, and then Aššur and the area of the Hābūr triangle, where he made Šekhna his royal residence and renamed it Šubat-Enlil.105 According to Charpin we should not think of an “Assyria” during the reign of Šamšī-Adad I.106 The city of Aššur formed part of Šamšī-Adad I’s kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia, which at this time encompassed the upper and eastern Jazira and represented one of several Amorite kingdoms (Map 1). Nonetheless, Šamšī-Adad I initiated major transformations in the political and cultural life of Aššur. It is with this king that we first encounter a titulary reflecting a fullfledged and sophisticated ideological program, which built not only on local (Aššur), Akkadian, and Ur III precedents, but also reflected his expansionist ambitions and thus integrated the central aspects of the imperialism known to us from later Assyrian kings.107 Šamšī-Adad I’s political skill is evident in his

strategic balancing of the local tradition of Aššur, which had its own established cultural discourse, with major ideological innovations of his own. The complexity of Šamšī-Adad I’s ideological discourse is due at least in part to his interaction with the kings of Ešnunna, notably Narām-Sîn, the first king to turn Ešnunna into a major Tigridian power, and Daduša, the powerful king of that same city with whom he competed for supremacy in the Eastern Tigridian region. Ešnunna “was the most important military and administrative center in the lower Diyala. In essence, it controlled access to this frontier zone all the way into the Hamrin Basin, which was the nerve center for one part of the Ur III military corps and also the key to martial, diplomatic, and commercial access to Iran.”108 Ešnunna’s social, political, and economic importance is equally discernible in its involvement in the transmission of cultural knowledge from the south to the north. Its kings, Narām-Sîn and Daduša in particular, clearly took the Sargonic tradition as a model to emulate109 and, consequently, played an important role in its transmission into the intellectual discourse of the city of Aššur during the time of Šamšī-Adad I.110 Šamšī-Adad I incorporated the originally small and self-governing city state of Aššur, which had established trade connections with Anatolia, northern Syria, and Iran, into his Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia. Once he had conquered Ekallatum and Aššur,111 Šamšī-Adad I eventually proceeded to take control of the kingdom of Mari and most of Upper Mesopotamia, from eastern Syria and up to the Zagros mountains. Following his seizure of Aššur, ŠamšīAdad I modelled his seal inscription after the traditional titulature of the Old Assyrian kings, calling himself “favorite of Aššur, vice-regent of Aššur” (narām Aššur, ensi2 Aššur) and thereby acknowledging and adopting local tradition. Additionally, Šamšī-Adad I included his filiation, “son of Ilakabkabû,” in the seal inscription. After his conquest of Mari in Syria, however, Šamšī-Adad I assumed a new style of self-presentation that includes the well-known rhetoric of the kings of Akkad. In addition to “governor of Enlil” (šakin Enlil), epithets such as “mighty king” (šarrum dannum), “king of Akkad” (šar Uri3), and “king of totality” (šar kiššatim) became part of the titulary of Šamšī-Adad I in his
108 Michalowski 2011, 181. 109 Foster 2009, 146. 110 Whether the Tell Leilan redaction of the Sumerian King List must also be attributed to this channel of transmission requires further research. Its discovery in Šamšī-Adad I’s residence in Tell Leilan speaks in favor of scholars having been in the environment of the king, as the list was compiled from two other copies and a third version of an unknown tradition, see Vincente 1995, 234. 111 Charpin and Durand 1997.

inscriptions, signaling his effort to construct a territorial state. The title “governor of Enlil” disappears at the time of the revolt of Puzur-Sîn, who considered Šamšī-Adad I to be a foreign usurper alien to the lineage of Aššur (“a foreign plague, not of the flesh of Aššur,” šibiṭ ahītim lā šīri URUAššur), and in its absence there appears to have been a return to the exclusive use of the title iššiak Aššur until the title šakin Enlil was re-introduced under Erība-Adad I (13801354 BCE) in the Middle Assyrian period. It is not clear whether the re-introduction of the title should be interpreted as a revival of Old Akkadian ideology or as the use of a trope familiar from Hammurabi’s prologue, in which (Anu and) Enlil are said to be responsible for assigning power to kings. The key feature of Šamšī-Adad I’s inscriptions in Aššur is that as a steward (ensi2) of the god Aššur, he is accountable to this deity. During Šamšī-Adad I’s reign there was a change in scribal practice in Aššur that can only be ascribed to the influence and physical presence of Babylonian scribes. Šamšī-Adad I’s monumental inscriptions are written in Old Babylonian, and “his and his son’s letters discovered at Mari show no genuine ‘Assyrian’ features of orthography, phonology, or morphology.”112 It should further be noted that in Šamšī-Adad I’s residence at Tell Leilan a version of the Sumerian King List was found that was also written in Babylonian script,113 which constitutes still more evidence of the adoption of Babylonian scribal culture at the court of Šamšī-Adad I. At this point it is necessary to comment on the title ‘mighty king,’ for which the kings of Urkeš must be revisited. The rulers of Urkeš seem to have adopted the custom of the Akkadian kings of writing the epithet ‘the strong one’ right after their name. This is attested in the names of the kings Tiš-atal and Annatal, both of whose names contain the Hurrian element -adal, ‘the strong one,’ an epithet shared with the god Nergal/Kumarbi at Urkeš.114 In Akkadian royal inscriptions, the title dannum – ‘strong, powerful’ – in its nominalized meaning, immediately follows the name of the king in the titulary, as in Narām-Sîn dannum or Šar-kali-šarrī dannum, ‘Narām-Sîn, the strong one’ and ‘Šar-kališarrī, the strong one.’ Only in the titulature of the Ur III kings is the epithet ‘the strong one’ paired with lugal as an adjective, as in lugal kalag.ga (strong/mighty king). This practice is then adopted by Šamšī-Adad I, as attested in line 6 of a votive inscription from Mari:
112 Veenhof 1982, 363. 113 Vincente 1995. 114 Personal names with the element -adal then become common in the Old Babylonian period, see Salvini 1998, 112; Trémouille 1999, 289.

Ideological discourse never emerges independently of interaction with groups that are considered outsiders or competitors by a particular cultural and political community. Instead, it develops in direct response to and in conversation with peer polities. While on the one hand the titles adopted by Šamšī-Adad I belong to the ideological program inherited from the kings of Akkad, on the other hand they simultaneously address peer polities who claimed the same rank, first and foremost the kings of Ešnunna. In this light, the first ruler of Ešnunna who was independent of the Ur III kingdom adopted the title lugal ‘king’ – which subsequently became the prerogative of the god Tišpak, with the ruler acting as his steward (ensi2). Beginning with the reign of Ipiq-Adad, Ešnunnean kings started to use the title ‘mighty king’ (šarrum dannum). IpiqAdad II introduced the epithet of ‘the king who enlarged’ the borders of the kingdom (šarrum murappiš Ešnunnaki) and ‘king of totality’ (šar kiššatim), thereby explicitly challenging his peers in Ekallatum/Aššur and Mari and establishing a precedent for the expression of territorial claims. The expansionist ambitions reflected in the epithet murappiš Ešnunnaki anticipate what later becomes the central premise of Assyrian kingship, namely the expansion of the borders of Assyria commanded in the Assyrian coronation ritual. Šamšī-Adad I shares the title lugal kalag.ga with the kings Narām-Sîn and Daduša, who seem to have been the most powerful of the kings of Ešnunna – possibly helping to explain why Narām-Sîn is mentioned in the Assyrian King List in the narrative section on Šamšī-Adad I and reflecting the military pressure exerted by Ešnunna.116 By that time the city state of Ešnunna had

Šamšı ̄-Adad I and Daduša 121
expanded its control over the Diyala valley as far as its confluence with the Tigris and incorporated previously independent cities such as Nerebtum (Ishchali), Šaduppum (Tell Harmal), and Meturan (Tell Haddad). Ešnunna experienced a decline in power in the decades preceding the reign of Šamšī-Adad I, a period regarded as the classical phase of Aššur’s trade with Anatolia when Sargon (1920‒1881 BCE), Puzur-Aššur II (1880‒1873 BCE), Narām-Sîn (18721829/19 BCE), and Erišum II (1828‒1809 BCE) were rulers in the city. Because Ešnunna was located on the trade route that ran from Susa through Der and then upstream along the Tigris, Aššur must have benefited from Ešnunna’s temporary weakness by controlling trade in tin during that period.117 Veenhof, however, accepts the possibility that Aššur’s trade might have started even earlier.118 After bringing Aššur, the Hābūr triangle, and the kingdom of Mari under his control, Šamšī-Adad I appears to have envisioned an additional network of power based upon the cities of Aššur, Nineveh and Arbela. During the last years of his reign, he undertook to conquer the regions east of the Tigris, which became the core land of later Assyria.119 In the winter of 1781 BCE, ŠamšīAdad I joined forces with Daduša, the king of Ešnunna, to conquer the region between the Upper and Lower Zab rivers east of the Tigris, focusing particularly on the kingdom of Qabara/Arbail. This campaign is recorded in the first example of historiographic writing, which is inscribed on a commemorative stele of Šamšī-Adad I now kept in the Louvre and narrates the events of the campaign against Qabara; the combination of military narrative and royal inscription anticipates the basic outline of later Assyrian royal inscriptions:
i 1‒10 ... [By] command of [the god] Enlil and [...] my attack [in Arraphe [...] seventh day [...] and I sacrificed Lacuna ii 1′-iv 12′ I entered his fortress. I kissed the feet of the god Adad, my lord, and reorganized that land. I installed my governors everywhere and in Arraphe itself I made offerings at the humṭum festival to the gods Šamaš and Adad. On the twentieth day of the month Adaru I crossed the river Zab and made a razzia in the land of Qabara. I destroyed (lit.: I struck down) the harvest of that land and in the month of Magrānum (lit. ‘Threshing Floor’) I captured all the fortified cities of the land of Arbela (Urbēl). I established my garrisons everywhere. Qabara ... [...] In ... the harv[est] ... that city in the month ... they did not carry ... that city in [...] Lacuna120

122 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
Šamšī-Adad I’s inscription describing his campaign against Arraphe and Qabara differs greatly from his building inscriptions dedicated to the Aššur temple and the Ištar temple Emenue at Nineveh, in which the narrative emphasis is on the process of building the temple rather than on military campaigns, in line with the traditional Sumero-Babylonian model. Although much more fragmentary, Šamšī-Adad I’s inscription on his victory stele, like the stele of Daduša, reveals numerous elements well-known from later Middle Assyrian royal inscriptions – possibly due to the nature of the stele as carrier of the inscription. These elements are as follows: war waged in the name of a god, in this case Enlil and another god, probably Aššur; a narrative concerning the successful conquest of a region, in this case the Hurrian kingdom of Arraphe though the details do not survive; the annexation of a land (kur/mātu) to Aššur through its administrative reorganization and the appointment of governors; the king’s celebration of an important local festival – in this particular case the humṭum-festival – to ingratiate himself with local elites and to gain the support of their gods; and finally references to razzias like that in Qabara and the installation of garrisons.121 The importance of Arraphe (āl ilāni) to the kingdom of Arraphe is clear from one of the Old Babylonian letters from Šemšara, which mentions a treaty ceremony relating to a treaty between ŠamšīAdad I and Yašub-dIM performed in the temple of the storm god of Arraphe,122 an important cultic center in the Eastern Tigridian area.123 Although it is only mentioned in passing in his stele, Šamšī-Adad I’s installation of governors (šaknu) appears to refer to the reorganization of the conquered areas as provinces under his control, an administrative system that the Mitanni state and then the Middle Assyrian kings would develop and perfect. It should also be noted that despite its poor state of preservation, Šamšī-Adad I’s stele resembles Daduša’s stele in style and iconographic content, emphasizing the smiting of the enemy in various forms. Having vanquished the Hurrian kingdom of Arraphe in 1781 BCE, ŠamšīAdad I proceeded to invade the region of the Lower Zab while his son IšmeDagan captured Nineveh and his son Yasmah-Adad concentrated on Qabara, gateway to the Lower Zab, which fell in the fall of 1780 BCE.124 Both city states

For further evidence revealing the importance of the cultic center of the storm god see Schwemer 2001, 266‒267. 124 Charpin/Ziegler 2003, 76.



Šamšı ̄-Adad I and Daduša 123
had remained independent polities until then, functioning as buffer states between Ešnunna and Aššur. At some point after the conquest of Nurrugum-Nineveh, Šamšī-Adad I began rebuilding Emenue, its temple of Ištar. The conquest of Nurrugum-Nineveh is mentioned only briefly to provide a sequence of events that links Šamšī-Adad I to the dynasty of Akkad:125
The temple Emenue – which (is) in the district of Emašmaš, the old temple – which Manišutušu, son of Sargon, king of Akkad, had built, (that temple) had become dilapidated. The temple which none of the kings who preceded me from the fall of Akkade until my sovereignty, until the capture of Nurrugum – seven generations had past and ...126
Šamšī-Adad I’s building inscription for Emenue also demonstrates that the cult of Ištar was active in the city of Aššur at least from the reign of the Old Akkadian king Maništušu (2269‒2255 BCE). Ištar-of-Nineveh was already known in the south – specifically in Nippur – by her Hurrian name dŠa-u18-ša-Ni-nu-aki during the Ur III period.127 She had probably been brought there by the sister of king Tiš-atal of Nineveh when she married Šu-Sîn of Ur.128 Her cult in Nineveh attained such importance that Šamšī-Adad I traveled there for oracular inquiries (têrētum) before going on campaign.129 The revolt of the Turukkeans brought an end to Šamšī-Adad I’s campaign between the Zab rivers, as it obliged him to focus his attention elsewhere.130 In Šamšī-Adad I’s victory stele commemorating the campaign, credit for all conquests is assigned to him (fig. 20).131 Daduša’s victory stele (fig. 21), by contrast, reads differently. Having emerged victorious from the military confrontations, Daduša’s stele claims that he offered Qabara and its population as a diplomatic gift to Šamšī-Adad I, implying that it was Daduša himself who conquered Qabara while simultaneously acknowledging the superior status of Šamšī-Adad I.132 These events occurred in the last years of Daduša’s reign and are confirmed by eponym dates from Mari and Šemšara as well as year names

on tablets from Šduppum and Nerebtum.133 Interestingly, in Daduša’s stele Šamšī-Adad I is referred to as ‘king of Ekallatum,’ reflecting the fact that although Šamšī-Adad I’s kingdom was administered from Šubat-Enlil, Ekallatum, and Mari, his cultural politics were perceived as being centered on Ekallatum/Aššur. Daduša’s victory stele, which is much better preserved than the Louvre stele of Šamšī-Adad I, represents an important document for the development of Tigridian historiography.134 Like Šamšī-Adad I’s inscription, it anticipates the typical structure of later Assyrian royal inscriptions in its presentation of the name, filiation, and titulary of the king, which is here preceded by the invocation of the storm god Adad. It should be noted that Adad also figures as the prominent warrior deity in the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend,135 thus linking

the conception of the storm god in Aššur to that of Ešnunna. Similarly, Adad is the figure depicted as treading on the enemy in the upper register of the Daduša stele, flanked by Daduša himself, who is represented as a supplicant in a manner comparable to Hammurabi on his stele. The Daduša stele records the sequence of events relating to a military campaign, including a description of the spoils brought to Daduša’s royal residence following the campaign’s successful conclusion; the campaign itself is justified by a perceived lack of respect for the king and ends in a swift victory that is accompanied by extensive destruction, the abduction of gods, and the bringing of extensive booty to Ešnunna:
When Anum and Enlil (v) with a magnificent order instructed me in a lordly way to exercise kingship over the universe (šarrūt kiššatim) forever and govern the totality of the people (kullat nišī), (when) at the declaration of Warrior Tišpak and Adad, my god, the skill of battle, that of throwing down all evil (naphar lemnūtim) and of lifting up the head of Ešnunna, was majestically given to me – at that time Qabra, where none of the princes, my predecessors, who have ruled in Ešnunna, nor of the kings who exist in the whole world, where no king at all had ventured to besiege it, to this land that hated me and failed to bow down respectfully upon the evocation of my honorable name I sent ten thousand first rate troops. With the strong weapon of warrior Tišpak and Adad, my god, (vii) I passed through its territory like the wild kašūšum (divine destruction). His allied forces and all his warriors, none of them offered me any resistance, his widespread cities Tutarra, Hatkum, Hurarā, Kirhum and his extensive settlements I swiftly seized with my strong weapon. I truly had their gods, their booty and their precious wealth brought to Ešnunna, my royal capital. (viii) After I had laid waste to its surrounding territories and crushed his extensive land, I majestically approach Qabra, his main city. In ten days I seized this city by means of a surrounding siege wall, by heaping up earth, with the help of a breach, an attack and my great strength. I swiftly bound its king Bunu-Ištar by the blaze of my strong weapon and I truly had his head quickly brought to Ešnunna. (ix) The determination of the kings who supported him and his allies dissolved altogether and I truly set them in deadly silence. I brought in a lordly way his vast booty, the heavy treasure of this city, gold, silver, precious stones, fine luxuries and everything else that this land possessed, to Ešnunna, my royal capital, and (x) I truly exhibited it to all people, young and old, of the upper and lower land. All that remained in this land, this city, its vast territory and its settlements, I truly gave as a gift to Šamšī-Adad, king of Ekallatum ...136
Some details of this narrative are unusual, namely the exhibition of the spoils of war to the inhabitants of Ešnunna, the reference to Daduša’s presentation of Qabra to Šamšī-Adad I as a gift, and the description of the imagery on the stele itself, which has been preserved. Daduša’s representation in the upper register of his stele in a praying posture addressing the celestial bodies of Sîn

Šamšı ̄-Adad I and Daduša 127
and Šamaš likely reflects the rising importance of astrology in the Old Babylonian period, which is also apparent with the emergence of the first astrological omen tablets at that time. Another unusual feature of the Daduša stele is the inclusion of a prayer addressed to the god Adad, who had enabled the king’s victory by means of his strong weapon. Reference to filiation and epithets like ‘mighty king’ (lugal kalag.ga), ‘beloved of Tišpak,’ and ‘for whom Adad has determined the conquest of his enemy with a strong weapon’ – all of which appear in the Daduša stele emerge as the typical tropes of Tigridian ideological discourse. The epithet ‘seed of a long-lasting lineage’, by contrast, appears to have been shared with the kings of Babylon who were of Amorite origin, entering into the Assyrian titulary only in the first millennium BCE. Also typically Babylonian and reminiscent of the prologue to Hammurabi’s law code is the trope of the establishment of Daduša’s kingship by the chief gods Anu and Enlil in a chain of command that passes through the city god Tišpak and Daduša’s personal god Adad.137 The inclusion of the personal god is characteristic of a particularly Ešnunnean royal discourse (iv 13‒v 11) and does not occur in Hammurabi’s stele. Šamšī-Adad I, on the other hand, does refer to his personal god Sîn in his inscription from the Aššur temple, demonstrating yet again that there was significant overlap between the royal ideology of Ešnunna and that of Aššur.138 Although the style of the Daduša stele inscription has been classified as awkward,139 together with the Louvre stele of Šamšī-Adad I it constitutes the earliest known attempt to draw up a military report within the framework of an address delivered to the gods, framed by the invocation of a god and royal titulary at the beginning and a curse formula at the end, which mimics at least in part the structure of Akkadian royal inscriptions. The particular structure of Daduša’s military report reappears only under the Middle Assyrian kings in the second half of the second millennium BCE, and then develops into the form of annals under Tiglath-Pileser I (1114‒1076 BCE). In its attempt to model the king’s image after his achievements while reinventing established tropes, the Daduša stele represents a beautiful illustration of the creativity of ancient scholars. These scholars adapted received tradition in light of the relevant historical events of their time and in the process they fashioned new forms of royal self-representation.

128 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
The only other roughly contemporaneous inscriptions that can be compared stylistically and in terms of their historical scope to the victory steles of Šamšī-Adad I and Daduša are Yahdun-Līm’s Disc Inscription and his brick inscriptions recording his building of the Šamaš temple in Mari. In contrast to Šamšī-Adad I’s and Daduša’s inscriptions, Yahdun-Līm’s Disc Inscription begins with the king’s name and titulary before introducing the topos of divine election; in this case Dagan selects Yahdun-Līm for kingship. The Disc Inscription also describes more than a single military campaign, as it records both Yahdun-Līm’s victory over the Khanean chiefs and his foundation of the new fortress Dūr-Yahdun-Līm:
Yahdun-Lim, son of Yaggid-Lim; king of Mari, Tutul and the country of the Khaneans; The powerful king, who controls the banks of the Euphrates. Dagan proclaimed my kingship and handed me a powerful weapon, “Destroyer of Kings Hostile to me”; I defeated seven kings – Khanean chiefs – who successfully challenged me, annexing their territory; I removed the hostile forces from the banks of the Euphrates, giving peace to my land; I opened canals, thus eliminating well-water drawing throughout my land. I built Mari’s ramparts and dug its moat; I built Terqa’s ramparts and dug its moat. And in the burnt field – an arid spot – where not one king since days of yore founded a town, Indeed I, having wished it, Founded a town, dug its moat and called it “Dur Yahdullim.” I then opened a canal for it and called it “Ishim-Yahdullim.” I, therefore, enlarged my country and strengthened the structure (lit. foundations) of Mari and my land, Establishing my reputation for eternity. Whoever discards my commemorations (lit. foundation inscriptions), replacing them with his own Such a person – be he king or governor May Anum and Enlil curse him darkly; ... further curses follow ...140
Several similarities are apparent between the inscriptions of Mari and Ešnunna on the one hand and later Assyrian inscriptions on the other. These include the statement of the king’s genealogy following his name, the account of a military campaign,141 the reference to a god entrusting the king with a powerful divine weapon, the king’s role as enlarger of the territory under his control

(māti urappiš), the king’s strengthening of the foundations of the land (išdē kunnu) in a formula typical of later Assyrian royal inscriptions, and the king’s provision of water for the newly built city, a motif that resurfaces in Assyrian royal inscriptions from the Middle Assyrian period onward (see Chapter Seven). Yahdun-Lim’s Disc Inscription also reveals a deep familiarity with Sumerian literary production, as the structure of its beginning is modeled entirely after Sumerian votive inscriptions. Like the Daduša stele, Yahdun-Līm’s building account of the Šamaš temple142 commences with an invocation of a divinity, in this case the god Šamaš, instead of with the titulary of the king, which here follows the prayer to the sun god. This structure might have served as a model for the Daduša stele, as its inscription begins with a hymn addressed to the weather god. The subsequent military account in Yahdun-Līm’s Šamaš temple inscription describes the king’s expedition to the Mediterranean Sea, achieving mythic dimensions through its account of the arrival of Yahdun-Līm’s soldiers at the seashore and their bathing in the Mediterranean, which in one case is referred to as a.ab.ba rather than tiāmtum.143 Yahdun-Līm’s description of the felling of trees in the Cedar Mountains, reminiscent of Gilgameš’s achievements recorded in the episode of Gilgameš and Huwawa, becomes yet another trope of royal discourse and reemerges in later Assyrian inscriptions along with Yahdun-Līm’s reference to ‘finished craftsmanship’ and technical perfection in construction.144 Because Yahdun-Lim’s inscriptions predate those of Daduša and Šamšī-Adad I, it can be inferred that the kind of textual work on royal representation that they represent might have begun even earlier at Ešnunna, perhaps even under its king Ipiq-Adad II, who introduced the notion of expanding the borders of his kingdom into royal discourse. If this is the case, then only chance has prevented us from recovering concrete evidence of such cultural dynamics. As a preliminary conclusion it can be observed that the commonalities linking the royal inscriptions of Ešnunna, Mari, and Aššur reinforce the impression gained from the linguistic perspective. Ešnunna’s political power in the Old Babylonian period is also evident in its function as a cultural model for its peers. Such cultural modeling resulted not only in Yahdun-Līm’s scribal reforms at Mari, but also helps account for the ease with which scholars during the reign of Šamšī-Adad I were able to draw and build upon a rich northern Mesopotamian cultural repertoire.

130 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
3.5.2 Daduša and his Scholars’ Library as Predecessor to the Exorcist’s Library in Aššur
Although its discovery is perhaps completely accidental, it should be noted that a seal of Daduša’s diviner Iluni has been found in Meturan/Tell Haddad, suggesting that this scholar may well have been active on the king’s behalf in cities outside of Ešnunna.145 It is conceivable that Iluni was in Meturan on a political mission, as is attested for other diviners like Asqudum at the court of Zimrilim of Mari,146 or that he journeyed there in order to cooperate with local exorcists at the king’s behest. Since no scholar’s library has been found in Aššur that dates to the time of Šamšī-Adad I, a closer examination of the textual production of Daduša and his scholars can help shed light on the development of Assyrian tradition and ideological discourse. It is possible to learn about the activities of the exorcists of Meturan from a tablet collection that has been discovered in a large house. This collection includes economic and administrative texts, school texts, letters, and literary, exorcistic, hemerological, mathematical, medical, and liturgical texts.147 Because the Meturan tablets comprise both utilitarian and literary texts, they provide a unique insight into the rich intellectual world of an eighteenth century exorcist skilled in apotropaic and exorcistic rites for the sake of the individual and agricultural rites intended to protect the harvest against every manner of natural disaster. The inclusion among the Meturan tablets of a collection of royal hymns on a Sammeltafel148 and Sumerian literary texts concerning Gilgameš not only indicates a deep familiarity with the Sumero-Babylonian tradition of the south but also concern with the institution of kingship; similarly, the presence of a Sumerian version of the myth of Adapa, regarded as the model sage, points to an interest in defining the professional identity of the exorcist. It is unfortunately impossible to tell whether the literary and exorcistic texts of the Meturan library belonged to the same person, as they were found in separate rooms. Antoine Cavigneaux and Farouk al-Rawi, the editors of the Meturan library texts, have shown that some of these texts exist in several copies written by different hands, suggesting an educational context. This notion is reinforced

Šamšı ̄-Adad I and Daduša 131
by the presence of school texts. Accordingly, there is a distinct possibility that there was more than one person working as an exorcist, which would point to a scholarly and educational environment comparable to what we find in the second half of the second millennium with the house of the diviner in Emar149 and in first millennium Aššur with the House of the Exorcist.150 The combination of utilitarian and literary texts in the library of Meturan is itself a clear indication of scholarly interest in both the weltanschauung represented by literary texts and in the application of this cultural matrix to social practice, as is evident, for example, in the ideological representation of kingship. Scholars can thus be seen to be integrating and regarding as unitary what we generally tend to divide into religion, culture, and politics.151 Another Old Babylonian library worth mentioning in this context is the library of the Enki Temple in Larsa, which includes hymns pertaining to the royal cults of Hammurabi and Samsuiluna (TCL 16 43, 61), liturgical poetry, incantations like the purification ritual for king and army before battle (YOS 11 42),152 incantations for the royal censer (YOS 11 49), and further the “liturgy of the celebration of a sacred marriage rite of the king Rīm-Sîn and the goddess Nanaya, divinatory series, penitential prayers, and mathematical texts.”153 The content of both library collections testifies to close cooperation between scholars and/or temple personnel and the king. Interaction between the king and his scholars during the reign of Daduša was effectively a continuation of a tradition hinted at in Ešnunna already in the Akkad period. A number of literary texts were found among several school exercises excavated in private houses in Ešnunna, one of which is related to the later traditions of the Great Rebellion against Narām-Sîn154 while another is a hymn extolling the martial qualities of the storm god Tišpak, thus reflecting northern Mesopotamian and Hurrian conceptions of the storm god.155 This evidence from the Akkad period is tantalizing, as it reveals the emergence of a literary tradition centered on the kings of Akkad in the region of Ešnunna during the time of the kings of Akkad. The existence of such a tradition helps explain the fact that later scholars from Ešnunna were conversant with the

132 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
discourse centered on the kings of Akkad, as is apparent during the Old Babylonian period. Moreover, it constitutes evidence of a trajectory for the transmission of the Akkadian tradition into the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend.156 Since they do not precede Daduša but do predate Hammurabi’s invasion in 1760, the texts from Meturan allow a glimpse into the scholarly world of an eighteenth century political center in the Tigridian region that interacted directly with Aššur. An interesting cultural link between Aššur and Ešnunna is the concern with economic measures demonstrated by kings from both cities. In Šamšī-Adad I’s inscription from the Aššur temple, he provides information about the silver value of basic commodities. The same economic concern is apparent in certain cases from Daduša’s law collection, which is known as the Laws of Ešnunna.157 Both texts, albeit different in genre, are reminiscent of the Old Babylonian royal edicts issued to cancel private debt obligations and serving to enhance the king’s image as provider of justice for his people. Indeed, the same trope is attested in the inscriptions of Nūr-Adad of Larsa,158 who reigned slightly earlier than Daduša in Ešnunna and Šamšī-Adad I in Aššur. In its demonstration of the growing professionalism of scholarly experts, the library of Meturan points to the social dynamics behind Šamšī-Adad I’s effort for cultural integration. The cultural dominance of Ešnunna at that time is evident in the fact that Mari’s scribal reform also adopted Ešnunnean scribal conventions with regard to the shape of tablets and signs.159 Similarly, both the king of Ešnunna and Šamšī-Adad I appear to have relied on the calendar of Akkad, as they share seven month names.160 One other feature worth mentioning in support of the notion of a larger cultural community encompassing northern Syrian and the eastern Tigridian region is the fact that the palaces of the Old Babylonian kingdoms of Mari, Tell Rimah (Qattara/Karana), Tell Bi’a (Tuttul) and Tell Asmar (Ešnunna) and the Eastern Lower Town palace in Tell Leilan (Šubat-Enlil) show similarities in their outline, all “built around an inner and outer courtyard, usually connected by a reception suite.”161

3.5.3 Šamšī-Adad I’s Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia: Political Pragmatism and Cultural Discourse
3.5.3.1 The Eponym System and the Mari Chronicles
Šamšī-Adad I’s (1808‒1776 BCE) efforts to fashion a cohesive kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia were effectively an attempt “to unite the whole Hābūr region and adjacent areas under a single administration, a system seen in operation in the tablets from Chagar Bazar.”162 Also important in this respect was the introduction of the Assyrian eponym system in the cities of Mari, Tuttul, Šubat-Enlil, and Terqa for the purpose of dating documents and streamlining administrative procedures.163 Probably introduced for the first time under Erišum I,164 the eponym system was the foundation of Assyrian chronological reckoning through to the very end of Assyrian history. Several eponym lists from the Old Assyrian period have been recovered in Kültepe. In addition, Mari has yielded exemplars of the so-called Mari Eponym Chronicle, which does not, however, “follow Assyrian scribal conventions.”165 It is interesting that one exemplar of the Assyrian eponym lists, designated by Veenhof as KEL A, exhibits features of an official scholarly text representing an ‘authorized’ full version of the list, including insertions referring to the Assyrian kings Erišum through Narām-Sîn. KEL A concludes with a colophon that is highly unusual in its lexicography and points to the Akkadization of scholarship:
[...] ÌR-sà iš-ṭur4 Šu-H[a?-x-x i]š-ta-sí-šu-um
Warassa wrote (it), Šu-H[a ...] read it out to him.
Veenhof observes that although typical of Babylonian scholarly practice, the verbs šaṭārum ‘to write’ and šitassûm ‘to read’ in the above colophon are not used in Old Assyrian, which uses lapātum for ‘to write’ and šamāʾum ‘to hear’ instead.166 The colophon of the Mari Eponym Chronicle reveals a similar phrasing:
ŠU Ha-ab-du-ma-lik mu-uš-ta-as-sú-u Li-mi-dDagan
By the hand (written by) H., the one who dictated it was L.167
162 Veenhof and Eidem 2008, 141; Eidem 2011, 58. 163 Van de Mieroop 2007. 164 Veenhof 2003, 20. Note that the KEL begins with year one of Erišum and opens with the statement that the eponym system was instituted during his reign: “After the accession of [Erišum], the overseer, our lord; after the līmum had been instituted.” 165 Veenhof 2003, 13. 166 Veenhof 2003, . 167 Veenhof 2003, 10.



134 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
Eponym list KEL A and the Mari Eponym Chronicle also share a similar division of the eponyms into groups according to the accession of kings to the throne, revealing that this scribal convention was shared by the scholarly circles of Aššur/Kaneš and Mari. For instance, in the beginning of KEL A appears the following line:
[ištu rēš k]ussîm ša Erišum [waklim bē]lini
After the accession of Erišum, the overseer, our lord.
The Mari Eponym Chronicle is likewise a scholarly document, preserved in several copies and editions that were composed on the basis of an existing eponym list and “fleshed out by adding selected pieces of historical information, which he (the author) may have derived from existing royal inscriptions, chronicle-like texts and perhaps even chancery documents.”168 As Veenhof notes, “his (the author’s) purpose apparently was to treat the period during which the dynasty culminating in king Šamšī-Adad I arose and flourished (mentioning i.a. his father, brother, birth, accession to the throne, conquests etc.), up till the year when he died.”169 One might add Birot’s observation that the rise of Šamšī-Adad I is set against the background of the interaction and tension between Šamšī-Adad I’s growing Upper Mesopotamian kingdom and Ešnunna, since several sections refer to their military encounters.170 Below follows the most detailed such section:

3.5.3.2 The Assyrian King List
Both the eponym lists and the Mari Eponym Chronicles must have formed the basis for the creation of the first large section of the Assyrian King List (henceforth AKL). It has been suggested that the list originated with Šamšī-Adad I (1808‒1776 BCE), as it is under his name that the author inserted a chroniclelike entry tracing his origins through to his conquest of the city of Aššur.171 In this vein, the preceding sections, comprising the seventeen kings who lived in tents, the forefathers of Šamšī-Adad I, and the Old Assyrian kings, have been interpreted as some kind of a prehistory to Šamšī-Adad I that combines ŠamšīAdad I’s dynastic Amorite origins with the urban element of the city of Aššur. The narrative entry concerning Šamšī-Adad I reads as follows:
In the time of Naram-Sîn (of Ešnunna) Šamšī-Adad went to Babylonia (Karduniaš). During the eponymy of Ibni-Adad Šamšī-Adad came up from Babylonia and seized Ekallatum, three years he resided in Ekallatum. During the eponymy of Atamar-Ištar, Šamšī-Adad came up from Ekallatum and removed Erišum, the son of Narām-Sîn, from the throne (of Aššur), and seized the throne (of Aššur). He ruled as king for 33 years.172
Because Šamšī-Adad I’s departure from Babylonia occurred after the accession of Erišum II, the Narām-Sîn mentioned in the AKL must be Narām-Sîn of Ešnunna.173 The transition from ahistorical chronological texts like the Assyrian eponym lists, which simply list the names of eponyms, to historiographic writing as represented by the Mari Eponym Chronicles and the AKL represents a
171 The five known exemplars are A) the “Nassouhi List,” from Aššur, (Nassouhi 1927); B) the “Khorsabad List,” (Gelb 1954); C) the SDAS List (Gelb 1954); D) KAV 15 and E) BM 128059 found at Nineveh (Millard 1970). The sigla are the ones used by Grayson 1980‒83, 101‒115. For interpretations of the list see Landsberger 1954, 33 ff., 109 ff.; Kraus 1965, 11‒22; Finkelstein 1966, 113; Malamat 1968, 164; Röllig 1969, 273, Freydank 1975, 173‒175; Larsen 1976, 36‒40; Grayson 1980‒83, 101 f.; Glassner 2004, 71‒75; Wu 1990; Siddall 2007.

136 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
new way of conceiving of the past. That the AKL dates to the time of ŠamšīAdad I is, however, doubtful. Šamšī-Adad I’s Ahnentafel has been understood as being interwoven into the three major sections preceding the reign of ŠamšīAdad I, namely “the seventeen kings who lived in tents,” the forefathers of Šamšī-Adad I, and the Old Assyrian kings of the city of Aššur.174 Only the second section can be said to represent a list of the “forefathers” of Šamšī-Adad I, as both it and the Mari Eponym Chronicle mention Ila-kabkabû and Aminu as powerful predecessors of Šamšī-Adad I.175 Nothing in Šamšī-Adad I’s inscriptions suggests that he conceived of himself as an outsider to Aššur. It is only later under Puzur-Sîn – who seized the throne from one of Šamšī-Adad I’s successors – that he was stigmatized as such.176 After Šamšī-Adad I’s entry in the AKL there are several further chronicle-like entries pointing to some kind of disarray or upheaval involving either the usurpation of the Assyrian throne or the assembling of forces in Babylonia in order to take the Assyrian throne. Doubts about dating the AKL to Šamšī-Adad I have been raised in part by the publication of a fragmentary Sumero-Babylonian literary bilingual text of Middle Assyrian provenance. One section of this text relates to the AKL, and the text as a whole should probably be assigned to the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I (1233‒1197 BCE), as he was the only Assyrian king “before 1000 B.C. known to have had a scribe capable of Sumerian literary composition.”177 Further, Lambert notes – and he was preceded by Cooper178 – that the text is closely related stylistically and in its historical allusions to the bilingual prayers to the god Aššur from the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I, and thus fits perfectly into the context of literary creativity that characterized his rule.179 Lambert writes about the author of this fragmentary bilingual tablet that he “obviously thought and wrote first in Akkadian, and then produced a totally artificial rendering”180 in Sumerian. Since the Akkadian of the text is Babylonian and not Assyrian, the scribe in question was clearly a learned Babylonian scholar in the service of King Tukultī-Ninurta I. The first section of the bilingual Middle Assyrian text relates to the AKL and summarizes the entries through to Tukultī-Ninurta I, while the second section refers to Tukultī-Ninurta I’s deeds on behalf of the city of Aššur and the Aššur

Šamšı ̄-Adad I and Daduša 137
temple in particular, for which Tukultī-Ninurta I claims to have maintained the regular offerings and increased their amounts. Special concern for the Aššur temple is also evident in the third section, which consists of a detailed account of Tukultī-Ninurta I’s adornments for the Aššur temples in Aššur and Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta. This section thus has an intertextual relationship with a parallel section in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic181 that describes the booty from Babylonia that was dedicated to the Aššur temple and used in its refurbishment. The first section of the bilingual text can only have been written on the basis of the AKL, which must therefore have existed in some form by the time of Tukultī-Ninurta I despite the fact that all known exemplars are Neo-Assyrian in date.182 While use of the AKL reveals the historical knowledge of the scholar who wrote the bilingual text, this knowledge was only used to establish a framework for the deeds of Tukultī-Ninurta I recounted in the following sections. From Tukultī-Ninurta I’s royal inscriptions it is clear that the provisioning of the Aššur temples only took place after his conquest of Babylon. TukultīNinurta I’s emphasis on his maintenance of the regular offerings might therefore be intended to divert his audience’s attention from the fact that he actually deprived Aššur of resources in order to build his new capital Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta and to transfer the cult of Aššur to his new residence. It is deplorable that the bilingual Middle Assyrian text is so badly preserved because, like the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, is appears to have included certain tropes of Assyrian ideological discourse that were integrated into the commemorative inscriptions only during the much later Sargonid period. Among these tropes is the notion of truth and cosmic order as represented in the term kittu (obv. 9), which amounts to ensuring an atmosphere of civic order so that ‘people did what was pleasing to the gods’ (obv. 10). The account of the restoration and sumptuous adornment of the Aššur temple in the bilingual text occupies most of the preserved text and immediately follows the trope of the establishment of civic and cosmic order. This is reminiscent of Gudea’s building hymn, which uses a utopian vision of peace and social justice as the framework for constructing the divine abode of the god Ningirsu. The author of the bilingual text is familiar with the typical “chaîne opératoire”183 of the ideological presentation of the image of the ideal king. Additionally, his use of the term bala for the kings preceding Tukultī-Ninurta I in the first section of the text signals intimate knowledge of Babylonian tradition as reflected in the Babylonian King Lists A and B, which build on the Sumerian
181 See Foster 2005, 315 f. col. vi. 182 See fn. 160. 183 See the discussion in Chapter 7.



138 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
King List. On the other hand, the use of the term ugula for the rulers of Aššur reveals knowledge of a local tradition typical of the city of Aššur. When using the term ina šangûtīya, “in my administration, lit. ‘during my priesthood,’” to refer to the king’s reign, the scribe follows a practice introduced in the Assyrian royal inscriptions of the Middle Assyrian period.184 Below follows the text in full, as it is of great importance to later historiographic and literary textual production in Assyria and reflects the author’s broad command of both Sumero-Babylonian and Assyrian tradition:

Šamšı ̄-Adad I and Daduša 139
Returning to the question of the origin of the AKL, it seems more plausible to date the text to the time when Assyria became part of the community of great powers in the Late Bronze Age. Although Shigeo Yamada is certainly correct in assuming that the entry in the AKL regarding Šamšī-Adad I reflects knowledge of the eponym chronicles, both of the eponyms it lists are in fact wrong and cannot have come from the Mari Eponym Chronicle.185 If this section of the AKL hails from Šamšī-Adad I’s reign, one would expect that such data would have been used correctly. The recent discovery of fragments of the Sumerian King List in Šamšī-Adad I’s royal seat Šubat-Enlil/Tell Leilan does suggest that there was historiographic interest among his scholars,186 which could conceivably have been maintained into later periods. In this context it should be mentioned that Aššur-uballiṭ I’s (1353‒1318 BCE) scholar (ṭupšar šarri) was of Babylonian origin and educated in the Sumero-Babylonian tradition.187 This individual could thus have been perfectly suited for writing a king list like the AKL, which has intertextual links with the Sumerian King List and the list of The Rulers of Lagash. All of these lists use the phrase “he exercised kingship for x years,” mu x i3-ak / x MU.MEŠ šarrūta īpuš, a phrase alien to the Babylonian King Lists. Use of this phrase in the AKL is thus evidence that its author was steeped in Sumero-Babylonian tradition and, in addition, had knowledge of the Assyrian eponym tradition. Further, knowledge might have been preserved regarding Šamšī-Adad I’s association with the Hābūr Plains188 and his residence in Tell Leilan, so that the author of the AKL was motivated to begin the list with a pastoralist section similar to that of the Genealogy of Hammurabi, which also evokes tribal origins. Yamada suggests that because Šamšī-Adad I and Bēlu-bāni were outsiders who had usurped the throne of Aššur, they were in particular need of legitimation.189 The AKL would therefore have served their ideological purpose of identification with the local royal line of Aššur. The AKL, however, is dispassionate about usurpers, and in some royal inscriptions both Sulilu and Bēlu-bāni are even referred to as founders of a dynasty.190 Moreover, from the intertextual point of view it can be argued that the AKL was redacted only in the time of

140 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE) or shortly before him, as Shalmaneser I is the first king who mentions Šamšī-Adad I in his inscriptions in the context of Distanzangaben regarding the restoration of the Aššur temple.191 It is also in Shalmaneser I’s building inscription that Ušpia, the penultimate king of “the seventeen kings who lived in tents,” and Erišum I, known as builder of the Aššur temple, appear for the first time in Assyrian royal inscriptions. The author of Shalmaneser I’s inscription was clearly interested either in identifying several stages of Assyrian history or in establishing an intertextual link with the AKL. Such telescoping references to the early history of Aššur do not resurface until the reign of Esarhaddon, where they occur in Esarhaddon’s inscription describing the rebuilding of the Aššur temple.192 Another purpose of the AKL, at least during the Neo-Assyrian period, appears to have been the recitation of the names of the royal line of Aššur in the context of the ancestor cult or on the occasion of the ascension of a new king to the throne, as was probably the case with the Genealogy of Hammurabi. A cultic purpose of this kind is suggested by the reverse order of the kings in the second section of the AKL, which covers the “forefathers” of Šamšī-Adad I, and by the “amulet tablet” shape of two exemplars of the Neo-Assyrian king list. As is clear from recent finds at Tell Taynat, this “amulet tablet” shape is the shape of tablets that were hung on the walls of the temple for display purposes. Yamada, however, assumes that such a purpose could only have been a secondary development on the grounds that the section in the AKL on ŠamšīAdad I centers on chronographic information rather than on cultic prescription. Although the evidence speaks against the attribution of the Assyrian King List to the reign of Šamšī-Adad I, his inscriptions do highlight his charismatic and emblematic role in the conceptualization of Assyrian leadership. Essential parts of his titulature continue to form the core of royal self-representation during the Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian periods, and the attempt to stake a claim for the glory of Aššur’s kingship is particularly characteristic of the literary inscriptions of Adad-nīrārī I (1295‒1264) and Tukultī-Ninurta I, as is clear from their historical epics. It should also be noted that several kings decided to adopt Šamšī-Adad I’s name while others refer to his reign in their Distanzangaben, including him in the lineage of their rightful restoration of the temples.

Šamšı ̄-Adad I and Daduša 141
In contrast to the Assyrian royal inscriptions, the Neo-Assyrian chronicles provide an unbiased account of imperial history and record events that did not reflect well on the king, like the reference to the various rebellions that occurred during the reign of Shalmaneser III. The purpose of these chronicles is not yet known, although it has been suggested that they “were intended as sources for creating omen apodoses.”193 However, as Alan Millard observes, they “frequently give less specific information than the ‘historical’ references found in omen texts.”194 Nevertheless, an intertextual relationship between the Neo-Assyrian chronicles and the AKL, which only survives in Neo-Assyrian exemplars, is highly probable, as the latter presents a comprehensive overview of the history of Assyria that reaches into a tribal past and intends to be undiscriminating. The chronicle-like reference to Šamšī-Adad I in the AKL can thus be read as a foundational statement that evokes Assyria’s expansionist dynamics under that charismatic king.
3.5.3.3 Šamšī-Adad I’s Rebuilding of the Aššur Temple and Aššur’s Enlilship Šamšī-Adad I’s (1808‒1776 BCE) conquest of Aššur resulted in two major alterations to the cultic topography of the city. One was the rebuilding of the former Adad temple as a double temple dedicated to the gods Anu and Adad,195 and the other was the rebuilding of the Aššur temple as a double temple dedicated to the gods Enlil and Aššur alike, which is generally attributed to the influence of Sumero-Babylonian tradition and is thus to be connected to the reign of Šamšī-Adad I. The notion of Enlilship as the expression of divine leadership was, however, apparently known in Aššur under Erišum I. When Erišum renovated the Aššur temple, the name of the temple was ‘Wild Bull.’196 The epithet ‘wild bull’ is usually associated with Enlil, who might have been present in Aššur before the reign of Šamšī-Adad I. This epithet occurs again in ŠamšīAdad I’s stone tablets recording his restoration of the Aššur temple, in which he refers to the Aššur temple as the temple of Enlil.197 He also reports that he gave that temple the Sumerian ceremonial name é.am.kur.kur.ra ‘The Temple – Wild Bull of the Lands.’ It is on the basis of this inscription and the archaeological evidence of a double temple that Peter Miglus has suggested that the sanctuaries of Enlil and Aššur were combined into one double complex

142 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
under Šamšī-Adad I.198 What then should one make of the name ‘Wild Bull’ for the Aššur temple under Erišum? Does it attest to the presence of the god Enlil in the Aššur temple already by this time, or does it amount to a theological statement about Aššur’s position as chief god of the city of Aššur through his assumption of Enlilship, i.e. his adoption of leadership in the local pantheon in the city of Aššur? Some of these aspects likely induced Šamšī-Adad I to monumentalize the association of Aššur and Enlil in a double temple. In addition to associating the cults of Enlil and Aššur, Šamšī-Adad I pursued an interest in ensuring that the cult of the originally Sumero-Babylonian god Enlil enjoyed equal standing in Aššur. This effort appears to have been rooted in the cultural heritage of the Dynasty of Akkad, which Šamšī-Adad I was eager to promote. The kings of Akkad associated themselves with the chief god of the Sumerian pantheon in order to foster their legitimacy in the former city states of southern Mesopotamia. A typical royal inscription of Narām-Sîn of Akkad starts with the statement: “Enlil is his god, Abā, the young man among the gods, is his family god.”199 Šamšī-Adad I’s eagerness to promote the cult of Enlil is further apparent in the fact that he named his new royal seat Šubat-Enlil (‘the seat of Enlil’). Still more, Šamšī-Adad I’s institutionalization of the kispum-offering for Sargon and Narām-Sîn of Akkad in Mari bespeaks his reverence for the kings of Akkad, whom he seems to have regarded as his direct predecessors and from whom he appears to have felt that he derived his power.200
3.5.3.4 The Kings of Akkad as Models for Ambitious Rulers
The evidence discussed in this chapter indicates the scale of Šamšī-Adad I’s political ambitions and attests to his development and use of cultural discourse to aid in the exercise of political control over a large territory.201 Although the evidence is limited, the elaboration of Šamšī-Adad I’s titulary in line with his expanding control over the territory of Upper Mesopotamia reflects the careful and sophisticated choices made by his scholars in order to shape his image as a successful and powerful king. Given Šamšī-Adad I’s origins in Akkad, it is not surprising that his scholars looked to the kings of Akkad as prototypes

Šamšı ̄-Adad I and Daduša 143
and models for kingship, thereby perpetuating and developing the specifically Assyrian literarization of the kings of Akkad, which is known from the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend found at Kültepe in distant Anatolia and is discussed in the next chapter.202 In such literary texts, the kings of Akkad act as standin personages representing the historical kings in whose times the legends about the kings of Akkad were written.203 A similar phenomenon is apparent during the reign of Daduša in the region of Ešnunna, where the library of Šaduppum/Tell Harmal yields a literary composition known as Sargon in Foreign Lands. This text describes Sargon’s battle against the Hurrians in the region of Mardaman, an area straddling the road through the Ṭur-ʿAbdin to Diyarbekir.204 It should be noted in this regard that the copy of Sargon in Foreign Lands found in Šaduppum/Tell Harmal is the only tablet known so far of this poem, representing further testimony of both Ešnunna’s interest in the northern regions and of scholarly interest in fashioning an ideological discourse based on the kings of Akkad. Šamšī-Adad I’s interaction with Ešnunna continued after the death of Daduša, as he attempted to renew his alliance with Ešnunna’s new ruler Ibal-pi-El II and met with his messengers in the city of Aššur.205 The literarization of the kings of Akkad constitutes a widespread phenomenon that is attested in both the formerly Sumerian and in the Tigridian cultural centers. In the latter group, this literarization appears to have originated with the scholars working under Daduša in Ešnunna and under Narām-Sîn in Aššur at the latest.206 Literarization of the kings of Akkad in Aššur might have begun even earlier, as two rulers of Aššur adopted the names of Akkadian kings, namely Sargon (1920‒1881 BCE) and Narām-Sîn (1872‒1829/19 BCE).207 This evidence identifies Tigridian ideological discourse as the direct precursor of the epic tradition that is subsequently elaborated during the Middle Assyrian period, culminating in the epics of Adad-nīrārī I (1295‒1264 BCE) and TukultīNinurta I (1233‒1197 BCE).
202 See Chapter 4.2. 203 Liverani 1993. 204 Westenholz 1997, 78‒93; note further that an Early Old Babylonian toponym list has been found in Tell Harmal, which includes the name of Kaneš, testifying to an interest in the Anatolian horizon, see Dercksen 2005 with reference to Levy, Sumer 3, p. 79 v 161. 205 Charpin and Ziegler 2003, 130 with reference to ARM I 37:19‒28: “The man of Ešnunna has written to me with regard to establishing an alliance (aššum napištim lapātim). I have taken out one clause out of the tablet of the treaty (ṭuppi nīš ilī). I have sent (a new version) to Ešnunna. The people of Ešnunna are obstructive and I have not received any news.” 206 The find at Kültepe predates Šamšī-Adad I as the house in which the Sargon text was found was destroyed in about 1836 BCE. 207 For the chronology see Veenhof and Eidem 2008, 29.



144 The Origins of Assyrian Cultural Tradition
It has been my aim in this chapter to demonstrate that the diffusion of cuneiform writing entailed the spread of Sumero-Babylonian tradition into the north. This is evident not only in the Old Assyrian incantation tablets from Aššur, which are written in Hymnic Epic Dialect, and in the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend from Kültepe, but is also supported by the finds of fragments of the Sumerian King List in Šubat-Enlil/Tell Leilan, the residence of ŠamšīAdad I. These fragments are written in Babylonian script on tablets in a standard treaty format, and therefore suggest that there were Babylonian scribes in the entourage of Šamšī-Adad I. The royal inscriptions from northern Syria, Mari, Aššur, and the larger Tigridian area, however, indicate that deliberate choices were made in the formulation of local cultural discourse in these regions. These choices reveal the existence of a northern Mesopotamian tradition that formed the cultural framework for the development of a typical Assyrian royal ideology. The finds of scholarly texts at the palace library of Tigunānum including ritual and divinatory texts of the sixteenth century and the AssyroMitannian tablets found at Bogazköy dating to the fourteenth century BCE represent further important vestiges of Tigridian or Assyrian scholarship active in the service of the elites before the time of Adad-nīrārī I and Tukultī-Ninurta I when such interaction is undisputed. Two tropes that were characteristic of the Assyrian conceptualization of kingship emerged already during the second half of the third millennium: the king as steward of the god Aššur, which expressed his accountability to the divine world, and his intimate relationship with Ištar. These tropes persisted into the Old Assyrian period, i.e. the first two centuries of the second millennium BCE when Aššur played a major role as a hub in the trade of tin. There was major ideological innovation in the eighteenth century, when Šamšī-Adad I managed to build his kingdom in Upper Mesopotamia. ŠamšīAdad I’s expansion resulted in the importation and adoption of Old Akkadian tradition on the one hand and in intense cultural interaction between Aššur, Ešnunna, and Mari on the other. Consequently, Babylonian tradition spread northward and westward. The association of the god Aššur with Enlil, which was promoted by Šamšī-Adad I through his building of the double temple in the city of Aššur, firmly established Aššur’s Enlilship in the Assyrian pantheon. Ideologically, the way was thus clear for claiming universal rather than merely local dominion by extending Aššur’s local role to the universal dimensions represented by Enlil. As stewards of the local god Aššur, Assyrian kings were entitled to rule the narrowly conceived land of Aššur; as stewards of Aššur/ Enlil, Assyrian kings could claim to rule totality. This new conceptualization was of primary ideological importance to Assyria’s expansion during the Middle Assyrian period.

4.1 What is ‘Universal Control’?
In the preceding chapter we saw the dynamics between sociopolitical conditions and royal ideological discourse during the early history of Aššur, when it became a major player among its peers in northern Mesopotamia and Syria. In this chapter I will discuss the central trope of Assyrian religion, i.e. Aššur’s command to expand the borders of the empire and ultimately to align the territory controlled by Aššur with the cosmos. As we saw in the last chapter, this trope was common to both Aššur and Ešnunna in the Old Babylonian period. In the Mesopotamian weltanschauung, any force that disrupted the social order had to be pushed toward the periphery of the controlled territory and beyond it, either by means of war or through ritual action. Establishing and maintaining order and eliminating disruptive forces was, therefore, the primary task of the king, whose duty it was to harmonize the condition of the world with the ideal primeval order created by the gods. This task situated the king at the threshold between history and the mythological and emblematic, helping to explain the recurrent use of the tropes of the king as hunter, as warrior, as caretaker of the cult, and as shepherd of his people. The opening lines of Ashurbanipal’s Coronation Hymn, which reflect the theological superstructure underpinning the institution of Assyrian kingship, illustrate the notion that it is the king’s mission to subdue the entire universe and place it under his rule. It reveals that “the border moved forward by the king is not simply a state border, it is the demarcation between order and chaos, peace and turbulence, justice and violence”1:
May Šamaš, king of heaven and earth, elevate you to shepherdship over the four [region]s (kibrāt erbetti)!
May Aššur, who ga[ve y]ou [the scepter], lengthen your days and years! Spread your land wide at your feet!2

Articulating the mission of kingship by combining the notion of shepherdship (rēʾûtu) with the claim of imperial control (kibrāt erbettim) is a conscious and deliberate choice, and it frames the present investigation. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the imperial claim to universal rule was inextricably tied to the notion of divine universality, which is visually symbolized by the winged disk that represents the national god Aššur (fig. 22). This iconography is a signifier for universal control on the one hand,3 and for the divine command to establish social order within the known and controlled world on the other. Furthermore, in Mesopotamian religion the conceptualization of the cosmic order was modelled on the social order, entailing interdependence between human action and the dynamics of the cosmic order decreed by the gods.4 Consequently, in this weltanschauung the king’s ordering of the world was the fulfillment of the original divine plan, implying that everything and everyone had their proper

position within the larger cosmic and social system. This notion involves a perception of controlled space in which any difference between the center and the periphery must be eliminated. By extending the borders of empire into unfamiliar lands, the distinction between the known and the unknown is eliminated. In other words, the empire becomes coextensive with the earth through the subjection of previously uncontrolled territories. Indeed, this is the mission of Assyrian kingship as promulgated in the Assyrian coronation ritual. Moreover, this notion demands total alignment in the intentionality and action of the gods and the king, and it is this understanding of reality that generated the entire discourse of royal ideology. The first step of this analysis consists of a diachronic investigation of the particular terminology used in the ancient inscriptions to express territorial control, which will serve to determine when it is possible to speak of an actual claim to imperial control. An investigation of this kind requires a thorough examination of the meaning of the terms kiššatu, ‘totality,’ and kibrāt erbettim. The latter literally means ‘four banks’ and originally designated the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, but in modern translations it is generally rendered as ‘the four regions of the world’ or as ‘the universe.’ While it is certainly true that at some point kibrāt erbettim acquired the meaning assigned to it by most modern translators, use of this term in earlier periods to convey the king’s control of inhabited space suggests a more discriminating reading. The language of the Sumerian royal inscriptions distinguishes between territory that is controlled by Sumerian city states, which is expressed by the term kalam, and territories subject to foreign lands, which are identified as kur.kur.5 These foreign lands were known though trade and/or from military conflicts. The distinction between the two categories is obvious in Lugalzagesi’s Vase Inscription, which was dedicated to the chief god Enlil following a military victory. Lugalzagesi’s Vase Inscription distinguishes between territory controlled by the gods and territory controlled by man, the former including the foreign lands while the latter corresponds to the city states of Sumer. Toward the end of the Early Dynastic period, Lugalzagesi, originally king of Ereš and Umma, as reflected in his title “lú-mah priest of Nisaba,”6 conquered the city states of Ur and Uruk and then defeated the city state of Lagaš. As a result, Lugalzagesi was effectively in control over the larger part of the region south of Babylonia.7 In Lugalzagesi’s ideological discourse this major political

148 Empire as Cosmos, Cosmos as Empire
achievement, which for the first time brought a large territory under the control of one polity, was linked to the claim of universal control expressed in a metaphor of the chief god Enlil, who was said to have placed all the foreign lands under his foot from sunrise to sunset:
When the god Enlil, king of all the (foreign) lands (kur-kur-ra), gave Lugalzagesi kingship of the land (nam-lugal-kalam-ma), directed the eyes of the land toward him, brought down the (foreign) lands (kur-kur) at his feet, and made them submit to him from sunrise to sunset, at that time, from the Lower Sea, along the Tigris and Euphrates, to the Upper Sea, he put their roads in good order for him. From sunrise to sunset Enlil did not allow him any rival.8
This passage demonstrates the close connections between Enlil, the institution of kingship, and cosmic leadership. Enlil’s kingship among the gods was established by the Fara Period at the latest, as the za3-mi3 hymns relate that Enlil is the one who separates heaven from earth. In the Kesh Hymn, likewise attested in the Early Dynastic Period in a version from Abu Salabīḥ, Enlil “emerges from his house/temple as the princely lord in his royalty” (nám-nun-e nám-nun-e é-ta nam-ta-ab-è den-líl nám-nun-e é-ta nam-ta-ab-è nám-nun-e nam-lugal-la é-ta nam-ta-ab-è).9 These early literary texts thus reveal a notion of divine kingship that aligns with the ambitions of the earthly rulers. Lugalzagesi’s explicit mention of control over the territory along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, i.e. along the river banks that ‘link’ the area between the Upper Sea and the Lower Sea, refers to control over all of the major cities located along these rivers and thus anticipates the title ‘king of the land (of Sumer),’ lugal-kalam-ma. This region is juxtaposed with the foreign lands (kurkur), pointing to a clear notion of the cultural cohesion of the south in contrast to the surrounding areas of the Iranian plateau and the Arabian desert. Interestingly, in his titulary Lugalzagesi juxtaposes the conquest of territory with the city of Uruk, the cultic center of the goddess Inanna, patron deity of kingship. He is “Lugalzagesi, king of Uruk, king of the land,” Lugalzagesi lugalunu.KI-ga lugal-kalam-ma, implicitly citing Inanna’s favor as a foundation for his legitimate kingship.10 Accordingly, use of the metaphor of the ‘four banks’ in the “First Empire of Akkad” did not represent something altogether novel, but was rather the

product of ongoing conceptual development.11 In the Bassetki statue inscription of King Narām-Sîn of Akkad, for instance, Narām-Sîn boasts of having defeated the city states of the south who had risen against him in a major revolt:
Narām-Sîn, the Mighty, king of Akkade: When the four banks (kibrātum arbaʾum) All together revolted against him, He won nine battles in only one year Through the love Ištar showed to him And he captured the kings Who had risen against him.12 Because he (Narām-Sîn) preservered the foundations of his city (in Times) of danger, (the residents of) his city requested from Inanna/Ištar in Eanna13 (in Uruk), from Enlil in Nippur, from Dagan in Tuttul, from Ninhursag in Keš, from Enki/Ea in Eridu, from Sîn in Ur, from Šamaš in Sippar, (and) from Nergal in Kutha, that he be (made) the god of their city Akkad, and that they built his temple within Akkad.
Like Lugalzagesi, Narām-Sîn references Inanna/Ištar first, before the inscription proceeds with a list of all the cultic enters of Sumer and beyond that Narām-Sîn brought under his control. The choice of Inanna/Ištar heading the list of gods was based in his special devotion for that deity; additionally, the fact that the ruler of Uruk, Amar-girid, had been one of the main leaders of the insurrection might have impacted the particular structure of the list of deities.14 Similarly, during the late Early Dynastic period the title ‘king of Kiš’ (lugal kiški) emerges, playing on the homophony of the city name Kīš and the Akkadian word for ‘totality’ (kiššatu); this homophonous relationship allows the royal

title ‘king of Kīš’ to signify universal control.15 The ‘totality’ implied by the title includes only a number of city states such as Uruk and Ur, or, in other cases, Kīš and Akšak, and might therefore appear limited from our modern perspective. Nevertheless, these cities represented major political centers competing for control over water resources as well as centers of learning bound together by a common weltanschauung. As such, when King Lugalkiginnedudu of Uruk assumed the title ‘king of Kīš’ in a dedicatory inscription to Inanna of Nippur, he might have been in control of the other city states of the south through conquest or treaty arrangements.16 Joan Westenholz emphasizes the fact that the few southern kings who claim the title ‘king of Kīš,’ among them Eannatum of Lagaš and Mesannepada of Ur, all credit Inanna with having granted them kingship.17 Eannatum states this explicitly: “to Eannatum, the ruler of Lagaš, the goddess Inanna, because she loved him so, gave the kingship of Kīš to him in addition to the rulership of Lagaš.”18 The origins of the concept of hegemonic control by the grace of Inanna can thus be traced back to the early history of the Sumerian city states, when they were still competing with each other for supremacy.19 Following his conquest of southern Mesopotamia, Sargon, the first king and founder of the empire of Akkad, clearly understood this concept, since his titulary begins with the titles ‘bailiff of Inanna, king of totality,’ maškim.gi4 dinanna lugal kiš, before proceeding with the established titles ‘anointed priest of An, lord of the land, chief governor of Enlil,’ pa4.šeš an / lugal kalam.ma.ki ensi2.gal den.líl.20 At least in the second half of the third millennium and in the first half of the second millennium, a distinction was made between the actual control of territory, implying political and cultural integration (kalam), and simple forays into peripheral regions beyond the heartland (kur). The textual evidence suggests that it was the combination of control over the city states and contact with more distant regions that was expressed by the title ‘king of totality (kiššatu).’ Distant regions were known through trade and military action, and might have been incorporated into networks of control as subjected vassals and/or

by means of interdynastic marriages.21 The ideological discourse, however, blurs the distinction between the actual control that was exercised over cities along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, and what can at most have been temporary or very partial control over the foreign lands described by the tropes “from sunrise to sunset” and “from the lower sea to the upper sea.” These tropes conveyed the image of a cosmic totality (kiššatu) that was culturally and politically integrated. This programmatic weltanschauung, which was already conceptualized in the time of Lugalzagezi, was propagated systematically by the kings of Akkad, who not only transformed Mesopotamia politically by introducing a complex and unified administrative structure but also inscribed a new vision of the world into the most remote mountain sides in the form of steles and rock reliefs.22 During the Ur III period, the term ma-da was introduced, which is a Semitic loan word designating the concept of ‘territory, countryside, march, frontier (area),’ but not yet ‘homeland,’ (= Akkadian notion) as is the case under the kings of the Isin Dynasty.23 Although later bilingual lexical texts equate kur rather than kalam with the Akkadian mātum, it is the Sumerian kalam and Akkadian mātum that share the notion of a “land” as a political entity comprised of a particular people. Later Assyrian royal inscriptions illuminate this understanding by alternating between the terms “land” (mātu) and “prince” (rubû) to represent a political community when referring to enemies vanquished during military campaigns:
Aššur, the great god, has entrusted me a kingship without rival, and has made my weapons powerful above all those who dwell in palaces. From the upper sea of the setting sun to the lower sea of the rising sun he has made the four quarters submit to my feet.24
From the very moment that an attempt to exercise hegemonic control is apparent in the inscriptions of the Early Dynastic and Old Akkadian periods, it is clear that the term kiššatu is used metaphorically to align the known world with the cosmos. The term kibrāt erbettim had not yet acquired a comparable meaning in these early periods.25 Instead, it remained restricted to the four river banks of the Euphrates and the Tigris.

4.2 Controlling the Land between the Rivers: The Sargon Legend and the First Macro-Regional State under Šamšī-Adad I
Until the Old Babylonian period, the Euphrates and Tigris rivers remained the dominant geographical reference points for kings, who mapped their regional control only along the river banks. The first explicit reference to control over the land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers is from the reign of ŠamšīAdad I (1808‒1776 BCE) and is found in a vase inscription dedicated to the god Dagan:
[dutu]-ši-d[iškur] [Šam]šī-[Adad], 2 ˹lugal˺ da-[núm] mig[hty king], ša-ki-in d[en-líl] governor of Enlil, 4 ensi2 da-š[ur] steward of Aššur, na-ra-am dda-g[an] beloved of Dag[an],

As is discussed in Chapter Three, Šamšī-Adad I is known for his establishment of a macro-regional state. By forging a triangle of control with three centers of power, namely Šubat-Enlil, Ekallatum, and Mari, Šamšī-Adad I abandoned the idea of a territorial state as an outgrowth of a former city state in favor of the ingenious concept of the macro-regional state, which was based on a two-level monarchy in which he was the ‘great king’ and his two sons were his coregents with control over their own distinct territories. Šamšī-Adad I’s ‘totality’ extended from the west to the east, as represented by expeditions to distant regions, like the Mediterranean shore in the west and Tukriš in the east, some
26 See AHw II, 643 s.v. mekû; Šamšī-Adad I uses the same epithet in his inscription on stone tablets from the Aššur temple, see RIMA 1, A.0.39.1:5‒6. 27 Charpin 1984, 50‒51.



Controlling the Land between the Rivers 153
where in north-west Iran. In Šamšī-Adad I’s inscriptions the notion of a north to south axis is absent, and this exclusion implicitly reflects the political reality of Babylonian expansion under the Old Babylonian dynasty, which prevented Šamšī-Adad I from advancing southward in a meaningful way:
At that time I received the tribute of the kings of Tukriš and of the king of the Upper Land, within my city, Aššur. I set up my great name and my monumental inscription in the land Lebanon on the shore of the Great Sea.28
By setting up a stele in Lebanon, Šamšī-Adad I emulated the practice of the kings of Akkad and claimed an idealized control over the westernmost periphery – namely the Mediterranean Sea – by carving his monument into the landscape. Šamšī-Adad I’s pairing of the Mediterranean shore with the eastern region of Tukriš to substantiate his claim to the title ‘king of totality’ is a striking choice. Adopted from the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend, this literary trope reflected political reality only in part, as it was only in the first millennium BCE that the Assyrians could claim effective control over the regions to the west of the Euphrates. The intertextuality between Šamšī-Adad I’s inscription and the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend is one of the earliest manifestations of the relationship between literary texts and royal inscriptions, as in this case a literary text provides the model for a particular trope used in a royal inscription. The Old Assyrian Sargon Legend was recovered from the private house of a merchant in Kaneš/Kültepe and predates the inscription of Šamšī-Adad I.29 Its find spot has led almost all of the earlier editors of the text to assume that it is a parody transmitted by Assyrian merchants to Anatolia. Dercksen, Alster, Oshima, and Westenholz have taken a different approach. Dercksen assumes an Assyrian origin of the text in the city of Aššur and considers it a token of the cultural contacts between Aššur and Akkad. This view explains why two early rulers of Aššur – Sargon and Narām-Sîn – borrowed their names from the rulers of Akkad and wrote their names with the divine determinative in their official seals.30 Although some of the text’s Sumero-Babylonian motifs suggest that it could have been written in Babylon rather than in Aššur, Dercksen is of the opinion that the geographical names it records reflect a northern horizon. He further emphasizes that the text is Old Assyrian in language and orthogra

phy and, in contrast to Old Assyrian incantations,31 shows no features of the Babylonian hymno-epic dialect. Because of the uniqueness of the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend, the ancient epic is quoted in full, mostly following Dercksen’s translation and his division of the text according to literary tropes:
Introduction
King Sargon, king of Agade the metropolis (rebītum),32 mighty king, who discusses with the gods. Adad gave him strength, and as a result I (!) took possession of the land from East to West and on one single day I did battle with seventy cities; I captured their rulers and I destroyed their cities.
The first feat: Sargon the hunter and athlete
I swear by Adad, the lord of strength, and by Ištar, the lady of battle! I saw a gazelle and I threw a brick into the river. But while I was running, my girdle broke; I attached a snake, ran on and caught the gazelle. (Then) I took the brick out of the water.
The second feat: Sargon the provider
I swear by Adad and Ištar! Every day I truly slaughter one thousand oxen and six thousand sheep. I did indeed slaughter daily. Seven thousand (are) my heroes who are daily eating brisket in my presence. Three thousand are my runners who are eating loins. A thousand are my cupbearers who are daily eating marrow from shanks until they are satisfied. ... invited (them) and my seven thousand heroes ate brisket. For the last man brisket was found lacking; he slaughtered his ox from Kušamman that belonged to his travel seat and he gave brisket to the last man. My cook let mediocre meat burn and as a punishment he slaughtered one hundred oxen two hundred, and I fed it to my servants.
The third feat: Sargon resisting darkness
I swear by Adad and Ištar! For seven years, one month and fifteen days I stayed in darkness, together with my army. When I came out, indeed I did take a measuring rod (decorated with) carnelian and lapis lazuli, and indeed I divided the land; I divided the Humanum33 mountain in two parts and put up my statue between them as a (marking) stake.
The fourth feat: Sargon the conquering hero
The prince of Tukriš I dressed in an animal skin. As for (the men of) Hudura:34 I applied a slave mark to their heads. As for (the men of) Alašiya: I covered their heads like that of a woman. Of the Amorites I destroyed their penis instead of cutting off their noses. I tied the heads of the Kilarites35 with a leather strap. I released the sutuhhu of the .... I shaved
31 Veenhof 1996 and Michel 2004. 32 As pointed out by Dercksen, the word rebītum occurs as an epithet for cities in Old Babylonian texts, and is also used as an epithet for Akkad in the Prologue of Hammurabi’s Law Code; it is further attested in opposition to kārum ‘colony’ in Old Assyrian texts, and interestingly also occurs in Daduša’s inscription as a designation for Qabara, see Dercksen 2005, 111‒112. 33 Mount Humanum is not to be confused with the Amanus Mountains and is probably to be sought on the Euphrates route to the west, see Dercksen 2005, 114. 34 Hudura seems to be a place near Puruškhanda in central Anatolia and Amurru could designate the region of Jebel Bishri, where the Amorites originated. 35 Kilarium is attested in Old Assyrian texts but its location is unknown.



Controlling the Land between the Rivers 155
the scalp of (the men of) Hattum.36 I pinched the men of Luhme with a toggle-pin. As for the (women of) Gutium (and the men of) Lullu(bu)m37 and Hahhum:38 I slit open their clothes.
Conclusion and praise
I touched the three posts of heaven with my hands. Why should I increase words on (other) tablets? Does Anum not know me? Let them increase the regular offerings to me, because I have been king and conquered the Upper and Lower Country. How I am king, (and) how I took the lower and upper country. Adad is king.39
Situating the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend in a northern Mesopotamian horizon on geographical grounds is supported by the oath formula repeatedly used in this text, which is addressed to the divine pair of the weather god Adad, who played a prominent role in Syria and northern Mesopotamia, and Ištar. The combination of Adad, written diškur, and Ištar is reminiscent of the Hurrian divine pair Teššub, who could also be represented by the iškur sign, and IštarŠauška. As already discussed in Chapter Two, the combination of Ištar and Adad occurs for the first time in the reign of the Hurrian king Tiš-atal in Urkeš in a curse formula; after Belat-Nagar, the local hypostasis of Ištar-Šauška in Nagar, and the sun god Šimige (dutu-ga-an),40 this curse formula mentions Teššub written with the Sumerogram diškur. Daniel Schwemer has emphasized that already during the Old Babylonian period Adad/Teššub was venerated together with Ištar/Šauška rather than with Hebat in northern Mesopotamia, which is also true in the Tiš-atal inscription. To be sure, it is not always clear whether Ištar/Šauška figured as Adad/Teššub’s spouse or sister. Further, blessings in the Mitannian correspondence of the Amarna period reveal the coupling of Adad with Ištar/Šauška,41 and the divine pair is also attested in the Hurro-Akkadian milieu of the eastern Tigridian region of Arrapha.42 As such, the decision of the authors of the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend – who were
36 Hattum is reminsicent of Hatti and appears together with Lullu(bu)m as one of the enemies of Narām-Sîn. 37 If Lullu(bu)m is to be equated with Lullubum, it should be located in the eastern Tigridian region, and thus would evoke the image of opposite ends. 38 The location of Hahhum is assumed to be in northern Syria, somewhere northeast of Adiyaman at a crossing of the Euphrates; see van de Mieroop 2000, 151 ff. As can be gleaned from itineraries, Hahhum was one of the stations of the Assyrian trade route into Anatolia, see Veenhof 2008, 12. 39 Dercksen 2005, 108‒110. 40 Wilhelm 1998; Schwemer 2001, 445. 41 See the letters of King Tušratta sent to Amenenhotep III and Amenenhotep IV, referred to by Schwemer 2001, 460. 42 Schwemer 2001, 460.



156 Empire as Cosmos, Cosmos as Empire
probably scholars working at the court of the ruler of Aššur – to direct that text’s oath formula to Adad and Ištar demonstrates that they operated in a northern Mesopotamian cultural milieu; in Assyrian ideological discourse, the pairing of Adad and Ištar persisted into the Middle Assyrian period.43 Dercksen also notes that the martial role assigned to Adad in the text is unusual and alien to southern Mesopotamian tradition, although the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend does share this notion with Daduša’s royal inscription.44 This corroborates my thesis that there existed a distinct Tigridian cultural discourse. In the fourth feat described in the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend, the author maps Sargon’s ‘conquered’ territory far into Anatolia and on an east-west axis, specifically from Tukriš in the eastern Tigridian region and Gutium in the Zagros mountains to Alašiya (=Cyprus) in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to shedding light on the geographical conception of the “totality” controlled by Sargon, this literary composition is of utmost importance to the cultural discourse and later literary production centered on the Assyrian king, as it anticipates the emphasis on the king as hunter and warrior and focuses primarily on his masculinity and power. Moreover, as already noted by Dercksen, Alster, and Oshima,45 the text was written by a well-educated scribe and abounds in literary allusions. These allusions include Sargon’s experience of the sun’s darkening, which references Sargon the Conquering Hero and Sargon in Foreign Lands, a text found in Tell Harmal and in omen literature (l. 42 in the third feat);46 the mention of the measuring rod, which references the Sumerian version of Inanna’s Descent (l. 45);47 and the treatment of the people in Luhme, which is inspired by a passage in the Cuthean Legend (l. 62).48 Moreover, ll. 41 ff. in the third feat are inspired by Gilgameš Tablet IX (ll. 83‒87; 140‒165; 173‒75), which refers to Gilgameš’s journey through a tunnel of darkness until he sees the light. The text also shares this vision with the Old Babylonian legends Sargon the Conquering Hero49 and Sargon in Foreign Lands,50 as well as omen literature.51

Building an Empire: The Role of Hanigalbat in the Middle Assyrian Period 157
The Old Assyrian Sargon Legend is an outstanding example of the transmission and reception of cultural knowledge. The text is informed by what Westenholz calls the ‘Akkad Saga,’52 i.e. the cultural tradition that evolved around the Akkadian kings Sargon and Narām-Sîn beginning in the Akkad period, and represents an improvisation on a variety of literary themes that must have circulated in oral form. Its compositional style draws on the royal inscriptions of the Akkad period and its subscript categorizes it as a praise of Sargon’s achievements that is to be performed in the context of the mortuary cult. The bulk of the text, on the other hand, is dedicated to episodes of Sargon’s life, all starting with the refrain “I swear by Adad and Ištar” and combining historical deeds with motifs from fairy tales.53 These passages were easy to remember and reflect an improvisational mode of reception, which is typical of oral tradition. The extensive intertextuality of the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend with texts from the Sumero-Babylonian tradition, however, can only have been the product of an educational and scholarly milieu like the one linked with the court at Aššur, and classifies the text as a combination of orality and literacy, which coexisted in Mesopotamian textual production.54
4.3 Building an Empire: The Role of Hanigalbat in the Middle Assyrian Period
The end of the Old Assyrian period is poorly documented. Modern scholarship faces a gap of more than three hundred years between the disintegration of Šamšī-Adad I’s macro-regional kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia and Aššuruballiṭ I’s (1353‒1318 BCE) renewed expansion of the city state of Aššur. As suggested by the work of Aline Tenu, it is possible that the Hittite-Hurrian bilingual text mentioning a prince of Aššur by the name of Šu-Ninua55 constitutes evidence of an alliance or link between Aššur and Nineveh around 1600 BCE, which now may be confirmed by the texts from Tigunānum.56 Be that as it may, by the end of the sixteenth century Assyria had lost its independence to Mitanni, becoming a vassal of this polity for the period between ca. 1550

158 Empire as Cosmos, Cosmos as Empire
and 1390 BCE.57 Only following the assassination of Tušratta and the Hittite invasion of Mitanni from the west in the fourteenth century BCE did Assyria annex the lands comprising the eastern Tigridian area and the eastern Jazira a decisive expansion of Assyrian territory that was largely directed by Aššuruballiṭ I. As documented by the exchange of diplomatic letters with Babylon and Hatti, it is under this king that the first signs of a growing self-confidence as a territorial state become discernible. This king secured Assyrian control of Nineveh and Arbail, as is expressed in his building inscription from Ištar’s temple at Nineveh. In that inscription, Aššur-uballiṭ I calls himself “king of the land (emphasis mine) of Aššur,” šar māt Aššur, with the term mātu now denoting a unified political entity similar to kalam in earlier Sumerian usage and in the inscriptions of Sargon, as well as in compositions from the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods.58 This use of the term first occurs in an Assyrian context in the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend, now shifting from a literary to a political context. Additionally, Aššur-uballiṭ I refers in his inscription to Šamšī-Adad I’s previous work on Ištar’s temple. He thereby associates himself with ŠamšīAdad I’s attempt to control the Aššur-Nineveh-Arbail triangle that constituted the core territory of Assyria in later times.59 Aššur-uballiṭ I also demonstrates a remarkable interest in promulgating the continuity of Assyrian kingship by recording his genealogy to the sixth generation, thus formulating an ideological vision that might have paved the way for the creation of the Assyrian King List.60 The importance of this king to the expansion of Assyrian territory toward the south is acknowledged by the author of the Synchronistic King List, which records Aššur-uballiṭ I as the first king following the period of Mitannian control over Aššur.61 Indeed, it is with Aššur-uballiṭ I that the Synchronistic King List begins its chronological account, in contrast to the previous section that lists the names of Assyrian and Babylonian kings and then their skirmishes. Subsequent to their conquest of new territories, the Assyrians were able to secure the heartland of their country from the attacks of mountain people and, later, from Aramean raids. Although the power of Aššur declined temporarily after Aššur-uballiṭ I’s death, this trend was reversed in the following century

Building an Empire: The Role of Hanigalbat in the Middle Assyrian Period 159
under Adad-nīrārī I (1295‒1264 BCE). This king expanded Assyrian control toward the region of Hanigalbat in the Hābūr triangle, which was the former core of Mitanni and a contact zone between the Hittite empire and Assyria of great strategic, political, and economic importance.62 Adad-nīrārī I’s political ambitions are reflected in the revival of the epithet “king of totality” (kiššatu).63 Following his defeat of Wasašatta, the son of Šattuara, king of Mitanni, Adadnīrārī I annexed several formerly important Hurrian centers, among them Taʾidu, by then the royal residence of Mitanni,64 Kahat, seat of the storm god Adad, and Waššukanni,65 the former royal residence; additionally, Adad-nīrārī I launched several forays toward the region of Iridu, Sudu, Harran, and Carchemish.66 His interaction with the Hurrian milieu is reflected in the end of his curse formula, which pairs Adad/Teššub with Ištar:
55 dIškur i-na ri-hi-iṣ le-mu-ti li-ir-hi-is-su a-bu-bu 56 im-hu-ul-lu sah-maš-tu te-šu-ú a-šàm-šu-tu su-qu 57 bu-bu-tu ar-ru-ur-tu hu-šá-hu i-na ma-ti-šu 58 lu ka-ia-an KUR-sú a-bu-bi-iš lu-uš-ba-i 59 a-na ti-li ù kar-me lu-te-er diš8-tár be-el-ti 60 a-bi-ik-ti KUR-šu li-iš-ku-un
May the god Adad overwhelm him with a terrible flood. May deluge, hurricane, insurrection, confusion, storm, need, famine, hunger (and) want be established in his land. May (Adad) cause (these things) to pass through his land like a flood and turn (it) into ruin hills. May the goddess Ištar, my mistress, bring about the defeat of his land.67
In his commemoration of his restoration work on the temple of the Assyrian Ištar, Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE) likewise features the pair of Adad and Ištar in his curse formula,68 thus continuing a tradition which was attested in the Assyrian Sargon Legend for the first time. This pairing persists into the first millennium BCE with Šamaš-rēša-uṣur, “governor of Sūhu and Mari,” who represents himself in the presence of the deities Adad and Ištar,69 and it continues in a different genre, namely the Neo-Assyrian penalty clauses in contracts from Nimrud.70

160 Empire as Cosmos, Cosmos as Empire
Another interesting feature to be observed in the royal inscriptions of Adad-nīrārī I is that this king uses the motif of sowing salty plants over the ground of the vanquished city of Iridu to prevent any further growth,71 a motif at that time only know from Hittite royal discourse.
I captured by conquest the city Taidu, his (Hurrian king Uasašatta, son of Šattuara) great royal city, cities Amasaku, Kahat, Nabula, Hurra, Šuduhu, and Waššukanu. I took and Brought to my city, Aššur, the possessions of these cities, the accumulated (wealth) of his (Uasašatta’s) fathers, (and) the treasure of his palace I conquered, burnt, (and) destroyed the city Iridu and sowed salty plants over it.72
Whether such action was actually performed or whether this is merely a literary motif is irrelevant. What is important is that the use of the motif reflects Adad-nīrārī I’s awareness of the strategic importance of the city of Iridu, which was located in the zone of Hittite influence and had been a site of conflict between Hittites and Hurrians some fifty years earlier as described in the treaty between Suppiluliuma I and Šattiwaza of Mitanni.73 It further demonstrates Adad-nīrārī I’s knowledge of Hittite ideological discourse as this motif links his discourse with the annals describing the conquest of Hattusili I in Northern Syria. These have been transmitted in later copies probably dating from the time of Hattusili III, who was likely a contemporary of Adad-nīrārī I.74 This ritual or motif, however, occurs for the first time in the Anitta Text describing the conquest of central Anatolia,75 where it is used to describe the destruction of Hattusa, which is to become the capital of the Hittite empire. This text interestingly uses the Sumerogram za3.ah.li = Akkadian sahlu thus suggesting a Babylonian origin of the motif. Adad-nīrārī I’s deliberate choice of this motif then reflects his claim that with the conquest of Iridu the Hittite and Assyrian states now shared a common border.76 The motif occurs further in the inscriptions of Adad-nīrārī I’s son and successor Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE) in his account of the city Arinu,77 to be revived only by Ashurbanipal (668‒631/27 BCE) in his account dealing with the destruction of Elam.78
71 See already my discussion of this passage in Pongratz-Leisten 2011b, 113. 72 RIMA I, A.0.73.3: 26‒36. 73 Beckman 1996, 42. 6A § 12. 74 Haas 2006. 75 Carruba 2003, 37 §XIb 48. 76 Klengel 1999, 164‒165. 77 RIMA 1, A.0.77.1:46‒51. 78 Borger 1996, 168 Prisma T V 7‒8.

Building an Empire: The Role of Hanigalbat in the Middle Assyrian Period 161
Assyrian expansion to the west was primarily a survival strategy.79 While Aššur’s local agricultural production was sufficient to meet the needs of the city during the Old Assyrian period, Aššur’s location near the dry-farming belt and its small agricultural hinterland proved to be insufficient to meet its needs once the city became the capital of an expansionist territorial polity. As a result, the area to the north and to the west of the Assyrian heartland, which was in the dry-farming zone and a rich source of metal ores, was of major interest to the Assyrians from the Middle Assyrian period onward. Expansionist ambitions and material needs thus help to account for the incorporation of the west into Assyria. A further impetus for this expansion was the trade in luxury goods, observable already prior to the Middle Assyrian period.80 In an ongoing effort to dismantle the power structure of Mitanni, which had built alliances with the Hittites and the Ahlamu nomads, Adad-nīrārī I’s son and successor Shalmaneser I established administrative districts in the Hābūr triangle.81 The surviving elites of the former Mitannian state do not appear to have submitted easily to Assyrian overlordship, organizing their resistance in the mountainous area of the Ṭur-ʿAbdin. As a result, Shalmaneser I’s son and successor Tukultī-Ninurta I (1233‒1197 BCE) felt compelled to secure the northern frontier and safeguard passage along the piedmont route from Aššur toward the Balīh river prior to continuing Assyria’s westward advance (Map 2).82 After his establishment of administrative districts in the Hābūr triangle, Shalmaneser I pursued an expansionist policy in the Jazira and finally conquered Hanigalbat, which was placed under the control of his brother Ibašši-ilī, who bore the titles ‘grand vizier’ (sukallu rabiʾu) and ‘king of the land of Hanigalbat’ (šar māt Hanigalbat); Ibašši-ilī’s successors all descended from his line.83 The sukkallu rabiʾu resided in Tall Sheikh Ḥamad/ancient Dūr Katlimmu, which from that point onward served as the region’s provincial capital.84

Further, the sukkallu rabiʾu assumed a status comparable to that of a viceroy, “overseeing rural areas and their output, supervising workers, supplying the Assyrian capital with tax-revenues, acting as legal authority, hosting officials during their travels, and even taking on specific policing and military duties.”85 His authority stretched over four districts headed by the bēl pāhete, who were in turn assisted by minor local officials (qēpu). In addition to Tall Sheikh Ḥamad, these bēl pāhete resided in Tall Fadǧami (Qatni), Tall ʿAǧaǧa (Šadikanni), and Tall Ṭabān (Ṭābētu),86 all located along the Hābūr River. Newly founded road stations such as Tall Umm ʿAgrēbe87 along the new route connecting Tall Sheikh Ḥamad with Aššur are an indicator of the Assyrian attempt to both control and colonize the steppe. The degree of Assyrian political control prior to Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE) over the various local polities along the Hābūr river might have varied slightly, but overall, with the growing pressure exercised by the Ahlamû no

mads marauding in the area,88 these polities must have had an interest in maintaining a good relationships with their powerful Assyrian neighbor. Such a policy is discernible in the local kingdom of Ṭābētu / modern Tall Ṭābān which together with its satellite city Dūr Aššur-ketta-lēšir / modern Tell Bdēri located just to its north on the Hābūr river yielded rich archaeological and textual information. The history of Ṭābētu goes back to the Old Babylonian period, when it operated as a local center under the district governor of Qaṭṭunan during the time of Zimrilim, an internal political organization, that was continued by the kings of Terqa.89 Its status as a local center is reflected in the textual record, including letters, administrative, legal texts, and scribal exercises,90 among them a land grant especially notable for its oath formula, which mentions Dagan (of Terqa) and Addu of Mahānum, a cultic center of the Bedouins in the western part of the Upper Jazira not far from Ṭābētu, representing the sedentary and pastoralist populations respectively.91 The particular choice of the divinities as represented in the texts as well as the local calendar, which was practically identical with the one of Mari and also later with the one of Terqa,92 anchors Old Babylonian Ṭābatum in the Syro-Babylonian tradition. Ṭābatum subsequently must have come under Hurrian control as indicated by a brick inscription recently found in three exemplars written by a local ruler named Adad-bēl-gabbe who traces his lineage back to an individual bearing a Hurrian name: King Adad-bēl-gabbe, son of Zumiya, king of the Land of Mār[i], son of Akit-Teššub, [also] ki[ng of the Land of Māri].”93 The rest of the Middle Assyrian inscriptions from Ṭābētu are divisible into two groups, the first group comprising 12th to early 11th century building inscriptions of the local rulers of Ṭābētu, who called themselves ‘king of Mari’ (šar māt Māri),94 and the second belonging to the royal administrative archive and dating from the middle of the 13th century BCE to the first part of the 12th century BCE.95 By the time of Ninurta-tukultī-Aššur around 1133 Ṭābētu must have reclaimed a semi-inde

pendent status as suggested by nāmurtu documents, recording gifts of the local ruler to the Assyrian king. Such evidence suggests that at that time the ruler had the status of a vassal rather than a governor in the direct service of the Assyrian king.96 From this first Adad-bēl-gabbe onward all subsequent rulers had Assyrian names, displaying the effort exercised by this formerly Hurrian dynasty by adopting Assyrian names also to appropriate an Assyrian lifestyle.97 Ṭābētu’s former Hurrian component explains Ṭābētu’s strong familiarity with Babylonian tradition, as close interaction between these two cultures had occurred since the third millennium BCE in Mesopotamia as well as in Northern Syria. Due to the strong presence of the Hurrians in the Hābūr valley, the storm god Adad, local patron deity of Ṭābētu, must have appropriated traits of the Hurrian storm god Teššub. His temple was restored by Adad-bēl-gabbe III (end of the 12th cent. BCE).98 Another temple was dedicated to the goddess Gula and had the same name as that known from Babylonian tradition, é.gal.mah.99 Further to the west, Middle Assyrian garrisons were established east of the Balīh River. These fortifications represented “fortified agricultural production centers,”100 which were granted by the Crown “as an autonomous farming estate in its well-defined boundaries and rights. The MA dunnu controlled vast tracts of farmland all around a fortified ‘industrial’ area; it was not open to secondary subdivisions or privatization (.i.e., all the personnel was of dependent status vis-à-vis the owner), and – in the main – belonged to a single individual, at times even of high rank, residing elsewhere and specifically in a city (provincial capital or other).”101 Such centers with their landholdings appear to have originated from the earlier structure of the dimtu attested in the Nuzi texts102 and continued an administrative tradition that had been established under Mitannian control. This explains once again why the Assyrians were able to control the Western territories with such speed and effectiveness.

Formerly Maul 2005, 15 with reference to Freydank 1991 still ignorant of this recent find had suggested that Adad-bēl-gabbe (now Adad-bēl-gabbe II) might have been a member of the royal family in Assur similar to the vizier or governor, who in Middle Assyrian times, were members of the royal family, see Cancik-Kirschbaum 1999; see also Jacob 2003, 59‒65. 98 Maul 2005, no. 3. 99 Maul 2005, no. 2. 100 Wiggermann 2000, 172‒174; Fales 2012, 101‒103. 101 Fales 2012. 101 f. with reference to Wiggermann 2000 172‒174 and Radner 2004, 70 102 Zaccagnini 1979.

The steppe garrisons Tell Ṣābi Abyad (Amīmu?),103 Tell Hammam at-Turkman,104 and Hirbat aš-Šanaf demonstrate a deliberate Assyrian attempt to control and colonize the regions between the rivers. In the later part of his reign, Tukultī-Ninurta I managed to bring this region of the Middle Euphrates between the Balīh River and the Hābūr River fully under his control.105 After Shalmaneser III’s conquests in 856 BCE, the region became part of the province of the “commander in chief” (turtānu), which at that time extended to the Euphrates with Til Barsip as the provincial capital.106 The efforts of the kings Adad-nīrārī I, Shalmaneser I, and Tukultī-Ninurta I to establish a larger Assyrian kingdom can be considered the first phase of Assyrian expansion.107 Tukultī-Ninurta I’s sack and pillage of Babylon constituted a dramatic moment in Assyria’s disturbance of the balance of power, which was divided between the kings of Hatti, Egypt, Babylonia, and formerly Mitanni. At least in terms of the ideological claims that were now expressed in Tukultī-Ninurta I’s titulary, Assyria’s defeat of Babylonia prompted a move toward the assertion of hegemonic control in the ancient Near East:
Tukultī-Ninurta, king of the universe (šar kiššati), king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (šar kibrāt arbāʾi), sun of all people, strong king, king of Karduniaš, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the Upper (and) Lower Seas, king of the extensive mountains and plains, king of the land of Šubaru, Qutu, and king of all the lands Mairi, the king whom the gods have helped to obtain his desired victories and who shepherds the four quarters with his fierce might I, son of Shalmaneser (I), king of the universe, king of Assyria, son of Adad-nīrārī (I) (who was) also king of the universe (and) king of Assyria.108
The defeat of the Babylonian king Kaštiliaš IV is commemorated in a stone inscription recording Tukultī-Ninurta I’s renovation of his palace in Aššur, the name of which was “Palace of the King, Lord of the Lands.”109 This title reflects the king’s claim of universal control and his appropriation of the Sumero-Baby

lonian theology of divine sovereignty (Illilūtu) and supremacy, which was associated with the supreme god Enlil and was now, following the Assyrian king’s conquest of Babylonia, appropriated by Assyrian ideology. Tukultī-Ninurta I’s victory is further celebrated in a literary poem that is known as the TukultīNinurta Epic.110 Assyria’s spectacular expansion during the Middle Assyrian period came to an end with the murder of Tukultī-Ninurta I and was followed by a period of decline between 1200 and 900 BCE, barring a minor revival under Tiglath-Pileser I (1114‒1076 BCE). Along with these first attempts at building an Assyrian macro-regional state, it is possible to observe a dramatic increase in the power of the Assyrian king: “The City Assembly disappeared and was replaced by royal officials, whose position depended in the first place on their personal relation to the king.”111 This organization of power is apparent in the Assyrian Coronation Ritual, in which the officials have to symbolically resign their offices by placing their official insignia at the feet of the king, who confirms their position with the words: ‘each one shall hold his office.’112 The most important measure taken by the Assyrians to properly administer their vast and ever growing territory was the implementation of a provincial system with provincial capitals placed under the control of the high officials, which was the foundation for the later development of the empire. The custom of entrusting state affairs to members of the royal family is well documented in the Middle Assyrian letters found at the provincial capital of Tall Sheikh Ḥamad/Dūr-Katlimmu, which served as the residence of the grand vizier (sukallu rabiʾu) under Shalmaneser I and Tukultī-Ninurta I.113 In addition to kingship itself, the office of eponym and the post of grand vizier were both handed down within the ruling royal family.114 During the three hundred years between Tukultī-Ninurta I and Aššurnaṣirpal II, the political geography of the Syro-Anatolian region changed markedly. The Hittite empire incorporated Kizzuwatna (Cilicia and the Taurus) into its territory and established secundo-genitures in Aleppo and Carchemish before collapsing; consequently, the geographical term Hatti migrated from the Anatolian plateau to northern Syria.115 Only Carchemish maintained its political position to some degree and preserved the structures of Hittite political organization. During the 12th century BCE Assyria experienced a shrinking of its terri

tory and only regained its strength under Tiglath-Pileser I, who conducted military campaigns to Lebanon and the Mediterranean Coast. Tiglath-Pileser I’s inscriptions reveal that by the 11th century BCE the Assyrians regarded Carchemish as Hatti’s political center and applied the title “king of Hatti” only to kings of that city.116 It is during the period between Shalmaneser I and TiglathPileser I that due to direct political encounters it is possible to posit also major cultural interaction between Hittites and Assyrians.117 Beyond other cultural practices such as the Hittite legal tradition of subordination and parity treaties,118 this might have led to the adaptation of the annalistic style in the Assyrian royal inscriptions under Tiglath-Pileser I already attested under Hattusili I in the Hittite sphere. Throughout this long period of expansion towards the west and towards the south with Tukultī-Ninurta I incorporating Babylon for a short time into Assyrian territory, the city of Aššur remained the political and cultural center of Assyria. While it seems that Nimrud gained in importance already under Shalmaneser I,119 it is only under Tukultī-Ninurta I that we see the foundation of a new residence as a major agrarian center on the other side of the Tigris to exploit the Eastern region. The existence of the new capital Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta was, however, short-lived, and after Tukultī-Ninurta I’s death, the center shifted back to Assur. Only during the first millennium BCE did the imperial center move to Nimrud, Dūr Šarru-kēn, and Nineveh. Such transfers of the administrative and political centers allowed the various kings to turn the respective residence into a reflection of their personal conception of Assyrian ideology and to immortalize their names by means of monumental building programs.120 The city of Aššur, however, once it was established as the seat of the Assyrian dynasty (šubat palēya) and the seat of Assyrian kingship (šubat šarrūtīya) under Aššur-uballiṭ I, remained the cultic and cultural metropolis; here the kings were crowned in the temple of the god Aššur, and many of them were buried in the Old Palace.

168 Empire as Cosmos, Cosmos as Empire
900 and 745 BCE, in which the Assyrian kings reestablished the borders of the 13th century BCE. Even this period was not without turmoil. In 827 Shalmaneser III (858‒824 BCE) and his crown prince Šamšī-Adad V had to deal with a major revolt led by the Assyrian prince Aššur-daʾʾin-apla who had allied with 27 Assyrian cities.121 It seems that Šamšī-Adad V (823‒810 BCE) ultimately defeated the rebels with the help of the Babylonian king Marduk-zākir-šumi. ŠamšīAdad V never refers again to these defeated cities again and describes campaigns that led beyond them.122 Control over them was not complete though, as his successor Adad-nīrārī III (809‒783 BCE) is still striving to consolidate the frontiers and central Assyria. It has been suggested that the reform of the provincial system occurred already under Shalmaneser III. In light of the evidence, Luis Robert Siddall, however, argues that it might have begun under Šamšī-Adad V and continued into the reign of Adad-nīrārī III. The provincial system, as created by then, became the backbone of the Assyrian empire and the basis of its stability.123 In this system the provinces delivered regular provisions to the Aššur temple124 and to the palace; deliveries to the former were effectively an “extension of customs which went ultimately back to a system of commonly ruling family groups of the Old Assyrian phase.”125 The administrative organization of the Middle Assyrian period appears to have been directed primarily by two viziers, one responsible for the recently conquered regions in the west and the other responsible for the management of Assyria’s heartland, including Aššur, Nineveh, and Arbail.126 In the NeoAssyrian period, a number of other powerful dignitaries became prominent in the administration of the empire. As the biggest consumer of resources and a center for manufacturing, the palace was now administered by the steward (mašennu). Other dignitaries entrusted with administrative duties were the “commander in chief,” (turtānu),127 who was the head of the Assyrian army and controlled the provincial governors, and the “cupbearer” (rab šaqê) and “palace herald” (nāgir ekalli), who could also act as military commanders. Two high dignitaries are only attested during the Neo-Assyrian period, namely the “chief eunuch” (rab ša rēši)128 and the “chief judge” (sartinnu), pointing to
121 RIMA 3, A.0.103.1: i 39‒44. 122 Siddal 2013, 85. 123 Beaulieu 2005, 49; Postgate 1995, 3 ff. suggests Adad-nīrārī III as the transforming force behind the provincial system. 124 Postgate 2002, 2. 125 Fales in press. 126 For the magnates of the king during the Neo-Assyrian period see Mattila 2000. 127 Dalley 2000. 128 Deller 1999; Tadmor 2002; Siddall 2007.



The Neo-Assyrian Empire: The King and His Cabinet 169
increasing administrative specialization and growing differentiation in the organization of power. The hierarchical relationship between these dignitaries is not exactly clear,129 but it must be stressed that these various titles rather conceal than reveal the multiplicity of functions that came with these offices. In any case, this group, which has been labeled “the Assyrian Cabinet,”130 was followed by the provincial governors, who were headed by the governor of the province of Raṣappa. From the Middle Assyrian period onward, the Crown appears to have exercised additional control in the provinces through commissioners of the Crown (qēpu) in the Middle Assyrian period and “military governors” (rab muggi) or “confidants of the king” (ša qurbūti) during the Neo-Assyrian period. This dual system of provincial officials and crown officials was probably intended to maintain control over the provincial magnates.131 The severe crisis toward the end of the ninth century BCE “is usually interpreted as a reaction of the old nobility against the expansion of the provincial system which put forward a new class of royal favorites. And indeed, after the suppression of the rebellion, the influence of this new nobility of high officials increased dramatically, especially the influence of the commander-in-chief of the army whose power often overshadowed the authority of the king. ... The extent of actual royal authority was at times quite limited, while some provincial governors acted as nearly independent monarchs.”132 While Shalmaneser III’s two sons competed for the throne during the seven-year internal crisis that followed their father’s death, for instance, the chief eunuch (rab ša reši) became very powerful. As described above, the younger son Šamšī-Adad V (823‒810 BCE) finally prevailed, and in his inscription found at Nimrud he credits his chief eunuch with his second campaign against Nairi133 and assigns epithets to him that are normally reserved for the king, such as “wise” (eršu), “experienced in battle” (mudê tuqumta) and “man of authority” (awīl ṭēmi). Twenty years later in 798 BCE, Mutakkil-Marduk, chief eunuch under Adadnīrārī III (809‒783 BCE), was awarded the special honor of serving as eponym alongside other ministers of the king,134 a position not occupied again by a chief eunuch until the very last period of Assyrian history. The power exercised by certain eunuchs is reflected in Adad-nīrārī III’s stele from Sabaʾa, which not only contains a dedicatory inscription (lines 1‒22), but also introduces Nergal

170 Empire as Cosmos, Cosmos as Empire
ēreš, governor of the provinces of Raṣappa, Laqê, and Suhi, along with his titles (lines 23‒25). Nergal-ēreš is then recorded in the first person (lines 26‒33) in the curse formula.135 The same pattern can be observed in the king’s stele from Tell Rimah, except for that in this inscription the section dealing with Nergal-ereš has been deliberately erased, indicating that he had fallen from favor. Under Adad-nīrārī III, strong personalities like the commander-in-chief Šamšī-ilu136 and other officials wrote their own inscriptions to commemorate their deeds, “just like an Assyrian monarch.”137 The military importance of the chief eunuch is evident in the reign of Tiglath-pileser III (744‒727 BCE), and the steady rise in power of both this official and the commander-in-chief (turtānu) under Sargon II testifies to changes within the palace hierarchy.138 In their annals the Assyrian kings seldom give credit to these social groups, and King Adad-nīrārī III may be considered an exception. Perhaps not coincidentally, it is also during the reign of this king that a queen mother, the famous Semiramis, who in the beginning of his reign due to his youth acted as some kind of regent, had her own stele.139 Modern historiography generally interprets this multiplicity of inscriptions as a sign of the weakness of the political center. Stephanie Dalley,140 and in her vein, Luis Robert Siddall, by contrast, have argued that the position of these strong men can be compared to the authority and power exercised by the sukkallu rabû as šar māt Hanigalbat during the Middle Assyrian period. In his detailed study of these four strong men Siddall points to the consistent use of highest officials in the control of northern Syria to secure economic and commercial gains. He argues “that the magnates were a part of the imperial expansion, and their prominence in the royal inscriptions was a result of their increased responsibility because of the political climate in which they operated. The political climate was problematic for two reasons: first, the 827‒821 revolt had greatly reduced Assyria’s territorial holdings; and the second was that Adad-nīrārī III was a youth when he came to the throne ...

The Neo-Assyrian Empire: The King and His Cabinet 171
In contrast to the tenor of the royal inscriptions, in which political and military agency is monopolized by the king, land grants and tax exemptions are clear evidence of the king’s acknowledgement and reward of faithful service. Such grants are already attested under Adad-nīrārī III.142 They show that land and people were at the disposal of the king who used these resources “from estates throughout Assyria for state projects and temple maintenance.”143 Land grants continue into the period of Ashubanipal as demonstrated by the following example:
[I, Ashurbanipal, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria], k[ing of the four quarters, true shepherd, who does goo]d, k[ing of righteousness (mīšari), lover of justice (rāʾʾim ketti), who makes] his [people content, who always behaves kind]ly [towards the officials who serve] him [and rewards] the reverent [who obey] his [royal command] [NN], eu[nuc]h [of Ashurbani]pal, king of Assyria, [one who has deserved kindness] and favor, [who, from the ‘succession’] to the exercise of kingship [was] devoted [to the king] his lord, who served [before me] in faithfulness, [and walked] in sa[fety], who gr[ew wi]th a good repute [within my palace], and kept guard over [my] kingship, [at the prompting] of my own heart, and according to [my own] counsel [I plan]ned to do [him good], and decreed a gi[ft for him.

While the historical introduction of Ashurbanipal’s land grant might sound formulaic to the reader, Aššur-etel-ilāni’s tax exemption for his chief eunuch is evidence that the king could and did reward actual loyalty. In Aššur-etelilāni’s case, it is loyalty during the period of the king’s “apprenticeship” as crown prince, active support for his ascension to the throne, and devoted service during his rulership that are being rewarded:

Moreover, as Hartmut Kühne observes there are indications of an intense investment policy whose purpose it was to develop settlement systems in the Jazira, headed by already existing ‘centers.’ Because these towns had to accommodate a growing administration that included both provincial functionaries and crown officials – the sukallu rabiʾu during the Middle Assyrian period and the ‘confidant of the king’ (ša qurbūti) and ‘commissioner’ (qēpu) during the Neo-Assyrian period – such measures prompted a level of urbanization that was unprecedented.146 An important step in the remodeling of the Assyrian provincial system was “splitting the very large provinces, thereby preventing leading high officials from becoming too powerful, and second by expanding the system for the first time west of the Euphrates, where a large number of provinces were created in the wake of the campaign against the small kingdoms of Syria and the Levant.”147 In addition, the land holdings entrusted to officials were now made up of “many different and separate plots, located in more than one area or even province”148 in order to avoid the accretion of too much power in the hands of any single official. While it was possible to inherit an official position, such inheritance depended on the loyalty of the officeholder to the king. Officials were endowed with a “variety of functions and privileges so as to make them operative extensions of the patrimonial power of the king. Their power was exercised in the judiciary sphere, in military conduction, in the coordina

tion of the civilian sector and public works, and in the management of a province which went by their name. They participated in the divisions of spoils of war, had a fixed cyclical position in the choice of year eponyms immediately following the King, and enjoyed endowment of land and people. As a body, they sat in council with the King, of whom they represented the true executive ‘arm’ in war and peace.”149 Together with the magnates of the king who formed the royal cabinet, the governors were counted among the “great ones” (rabûte) of Assyria. They were, however, lower down the political hierarchy than the magnates.150 The provinces were bound to the imperial administration based in the imperial capital Nimrud, Nineveh, or Khorsabad, depending on the time – and organized in a communication grid that was based on a network of forts and supply centers. This system paved the way for increased royal interventionism. Under TiglathPileser III Assyria embarked on its fourth and final period of expansion (Map 3), beginning with the conquest of most of Syria and Lebanon and concluding with the annexation of Egypt and Elam under Esarhaddon (680‒669 BCE) and Ashurbanipal (668‒631/27?).151
4.5 The Literarization of the Empire
Political developments deeply affected the metaphorical language used in the discourse of royal ideology. One important feature introduced by Aššur-uballiṭ I (1353‒1318 BCE) was the use of the term mātu ‘land’ to designate a political entity that had been incorporated into the Assyrian provincial system, where previously the term had been used to describe external polities bound to Assyria by means of treaties and other agreements. Peter Machinist152 has outlined the various administrative strategies employed by the Assyrians to integrate conquered regions into their empire. First, the conquered people were counted for/with (manû ana/itti) the people of Assyria, while the conquered state was turned into a province of Assyria (turru ana) or added to (ruddu eli) the border of Assyria. Second, the captured lands were reorganized by appointing Assyrian officials as their governors (šaknu/bēl pīhāti), while taxes and service in the form of corvée labor were imposed on them. Reorganization could imply the deportation of people, destruction, rebuilding, and even giving provincial capi

tals new Assyrian names.153 If a conquered polity was subjected to Assyria but not integrated into its provincial system, it was obliged to enter into a vassal treaty and to send annual tribute to the Assyrian king. Membership in the empire was consequently based either on being an Assyrian or, in the case of a distinct conquered population, being a “son of Assyria.” As such, the terms “Assyria” and “Assyrian” in the royal inscriptions point less to an ethnic understanding than to a political meaning, “defining a region and people that manifest the required obedience.”154 The cultural objective of these strategies was to eliminate differences through a process of administrative homogenization and the standardization of cultural modes of expressions like architecture and iconography. With Adad-nīrārī I’s forays into northern Syria and the conquest of the Middle Euphrates region, i.e. the former state of Mitanni, we again encounter the title ‘king of totality’ (šar kiššati), reiterating the ancient notion of the subjection of formerly foreign polities to the king. Assyrian metaphorical language reflects a degree of continuity in its use of the term ‘land’ (mātu) to designate what the Assyrians considered their cultural homeland. Yet in their attempt to incorporate more and more regions into what they called māt Aššur, they developed a new understanding of the term mātu that was primarily political rather than cultural. The word ‘king,’ šarru, only came to be written primarily with the sign man, which can also be read as ‘twenty’ or as representing the sun god, at the time of Adad-nīrārī I’s expansion to the west into the region of the Balīh river and the Jazira. Interestingly, this writing parallels the use of the winged disk as a visual signifier for ‘king’ in Hittite culture, signifying universal royal presence. It also attests to the continuity of direct cultural interaction between the Syro-Anatolian and Assyrian scholarly horizons, as well as to the scholars’ search for new symbols with which to express the royal claim to universal control.155 As discussed in the Chapter Three, the royal claim to universal control is also known from the Akkad dynasty through to the Old Babylonian period, though its transmission and development at that time is more difficult to trace. Tukultī-Ninurta I, who brought Babylonia under his control, reintroduced the term kibrāt arbāʾi in his inscriptions but used it with a new meaning. For the first time, it is possible to speak of kibrāt arbāʾi as denoting the ‘universe’,

since the term is combined with the image of the universal presence of the sun:
man dan-nu ˹le-ú˺ murub4 strong king, [capable] in battle, ˹šá˺ kib-rat 4 ˹ar-ki˺ dšá-maš the one who shepherds the four quarters [after] Šamaš, ir-te-ú ana-ku am I.156
By means of various cultural strategies, the king and his scholars strove to create a locative map of the world that communicated meaning through structures of congruity and conformity,157 based on the homogeneous action of the gods and the king. In this map, all positive qualities were concentrated in the center, while all negative qualities were pushed toward the periphery.158 Order and anti-order corresponded with center and periphery and with the inner and the outer world; spatiality as a whole was reduced to binary dichotomies such as cultivated land/civilization versus nature/steppe/wilderness. This construction was based on the psychological need for security159 and constituted the foundation for the Assyrian revival of the well-known tropes of the king as hunter, warrior, and builder of temples. The imbalance in status between center and periphery allowed for only one ‘correct’ political solution: universal empire as programmatically stated in the Assyrian coronation ritual. By divine command the king was obliged to enlarge the borders of his empire outward, toward the unknown. Such expansion mirrors the path taken by Gilgameš in his march to the lands beyond the cosmic ocean, as it is conveyed in the Babylonian Map. The fluid geographical notion of imperial boundaries – which responded to political realities – generated a concept of empire that extended across the entire universe and whose borders were thus equivalent to the borders of the cosmos.160 This dynamic conception of political borders obliged the king to keep expanding his frontiers so as to align them with those of the cosmos. In his discussion of the Sargon Geography, which he attributes to Esarhaddon, Liverani demonstrates that until the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I the Euphrates and the Zagros mountains represented the boundaries of Assyrian territory in the Assyrian mental map.161 When in the 13th century BCE Assyrian expeditions crossed the Euphrates and advanced toward the Mediterranean

The Literarization of the Empire 177
Sea, when Assyrian forces penetrated the mountainous regions to the north and east, notably the Nairi lands and Zamua, the established Assyrian mental map was no longer valid. The expansion of Assyrian territorial control beyond the Euphrates and toward the Mediterranean Sea meant that the oceans were now imagined as representing the ends of the world. Accordingly, the ideal concept of the elimination of difference between center and periphery dominated the inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian kings. King Shalmaneser III describes himself as the “conqueror from the upper and lower seas to the land Nairi and the great sea of the west as far as the Amanus range ... 〈from〉 the land Namri to the sea of Chaldea, which is called the Marratu (‘Bitter’) River.”162 In other words, Shalmaneser III claims to have reached the banks of the four seas: the upper and lower seas of Nairi, probably Lake Van and Lake Urmia, as well as the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf.163 By using the Akkadian term “Bitter River,” the scholar who produced this particular text intended to evoke an image of Shalmaneser III’s territory that reached the shore of the cosmic ocean surrounding the earth. Territorial expansion does not necessarily correspond to territorial control. Nevertheless, a claim to universal control is also discernible in public monuments, such as the iconography of city gates and obelisks set up in public spaces and temples.164 The programmatic emphasis in these monuments is on those geographical regions that are the most distant from the Assyrian heartland, suggesting the unlimited span of Assyrian political control. Iconography of this kind is characteristic of the obelisks of Aššurnaṣirpal II and Shalmaneser III, as well as of Shalmaneser III’s city gates at Balawat – ancient ImgurEnlil – which was situated strategically at the intersection of major roads connecting east and west in the core of the Assyrian empire. The geographical regions depicted on the Balawat gates and mentioned in the accompanying epigraphs include Phoenician cities and Qarqar in the west, the Tigris tunnel and Urartu in the north, Lake Urmia and Gilzānu in the East, and Bīt Dakkūri in the South.165 In these depictions, the emphasis is on the subjugation of distant regions and on the bringing of tribute to the Assyrian king, thereby contributing to the king’s prestige as provider for his country. Since the main roads of the city were oriented toward the city gates, the location for such a programmatic message was well chosen. Additionally, city gates represented the limin

178 Empire as Cosmos, Cosmos as Empire
al zone between inside and outside, order and anti-order.166 Therefore, Shalmaneser III’s choice of imagery is perfectly suited to illustrating the king’s role as warrior fighting external chaos. The material composition of the gates enhanced their potency as the image of the cosmos. They were made from cedar wood, which was associated with the Lebanon, and overlaid with copper bands, copper traditionally being associated with the east; as such, the very materiality of the gates symbolized the expansion of Assyrian power both toward the west and the east.167 The imagery of the city gates evoked the cosmos known to the Assyrian people, communicating their message even to the illiterate majority that would not have been able to read the accompanying inscriptions. Landscape representations on the gates portray a macro-region in which mountains are associated with the north and northeast, rivers associated with the south, and the ocean with the west. Once established, the cosmic dimensions of Assyrian expansion continued to dominate the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings. Tiglath-pileser III, for example, strives to outdo his predecessors by moving from the horizontal to the vertical axis and claiming that the borders of his empire reach “[from] the horizon to the zenith” (ultu išid šamê adi elât šamê), which in literary texts denotes the boundaries of the sun and the moon.168 The ocean is no boundary for Sargon II (721‒705 BC), whose conquest of the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea – a journey of seven days in the midst of the western sea (7 ūmī ina qabal tâmtim) – overcomes the established frontiers of the cosmos.169 Sargon II also conquers the island of Dilmun, situated 30 miles inside the eastern sea (=the Persian Gulf), and thus subdues both ends of the known world.170 These conquests allow Sargon II to portray himself as the sun god Šamaš, who is the only one capable of crossing the seas according to the Gilgameš Epic.
There never was, O Gilgameš, a way across, and since the days of old none who can cross the ocean. The one who crosses the ocean is the hero Šamaš: apart from Šamaš, who is there can cross the ocean?171
When Gilgameš emerges from the tunnel through the twin mountain Mount Māšu on his journey to Utnapištim, he is confronted by the scorpion man and scorpion woman who “guard the sun at sunrise and sunset” (Gilgameš Epic

IX 45). This association is explained by the nature of the scorpion that, as a nocturnal creature, is a symbol of death and night. Further, due to the scorpion’s regular ecdysis – the casting off of its exoskeleton – the scorpion is a symbol of birth and rejuvenation in Mesopotamia.172 This further highlights the iconographic association of the solar winged disk with the scorpion man, which is present in Mesopotamian iconography throughout the millennia.173 The expanded perception of space, incorporating the unknown lands beyond the mountains of sunrise and sunset, was crystallized in the Gilgameš Epic and subsequently emulated by the Assyrian kings in their ideological self-representation. As discussed above, the concept of an ideal world empire is expressed paradigmatically in the Sargon Geography and is associated with Sargon of Akkad.174 This ideal world empire encompasses the entire surface of the earth “the lands from sunri[se] to sunset, the sum total of all the lands”175 – and is represented in lists of place-names and geographical distances.176 The visual expression of this ideal world empire is anticipated in the imagery of Sargon II’s throne pedestal, which depicts the conquest of a city located in a plain on a shore and of another city situated in the mountains,177 representing the borders of the empire (fig. 23).178 Conventions regarding the appropriate use of particular epithets are discernible in the inscriptions of King Sennacherib (704‒681 BCE). The epithet “king of the four quarters” (šar kibrāt erbettim), reflecting the cosmic dimensions of the empire, only appears in his inscriptions after he had conducted military campaigns in the four cardinal directions. Following Sennacherib’s sixth campaign against Elam, universalistic-territorial claims are made: “from the upper sea of the setting Sun until the lower sea of the rising Sun” (ultu tâmti elēnīti ša šulmi dŠamši adi tâmti šaplīti ša ṣīt dŠamši).179 Sennacherib’s scholar used a highly literary style replete with mythic allusions to the creation epic Enūma Eliš in his account of the battle of Halule, such that this military engagement assumed cosmic dimensions.180 As Weissert notes, the literary al

lusions to Enūma Eliš are particular to Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule and thus serve as an ideologically motivated justification for the subsequent conquest and destruction of the city of Babylon: “The demonic portrait of the Babylonians, although sketched in the account of the campaign’s first stage (Halule), actually expresses the intense and zealous atmosphere prevailing close to, and during, its last (the siege of Babylon); further, that the mythic presentation of the past events of Halule served in effect to create the right political climate in Assyria for the impending materialization of Sennacherib’s horrendous plans; and that the passionate rhetoric became superfluous once Babylon had been sacked, and the frustration and hatred felt towards her stubborn inhabitants had found their outlet in the final victory.”181 The conquest and utter destruction of Babylon was deemed so important that it was also represented in a mythologizing garb in a pictorial scene on the gates of the akītu-house at the city of Aššur, where the god Aššur is represented in battle against Tiamat.
181 Weissert 1997, 202.



The Assyrian Capital as the Epitome of the Empire 181
As Liverani ingeniously observes in his analysis of Sennacherib’s titulary, it was at this point that the rhythm in the epithets changed from binary to ternary, and the pattern from an antagonistic one into a centralized one. “The two external titles, being universalities in character, are both opposed to the middle title, nuclear in character.” But, as he argues the combination of the first and third title “is not useless, nor is their order devoid of meaning. What we have is in fact the sequence: 1) general, compact totality (kiššatu); 2) inner core (māt Aššur); 3) patterned totality (four quarters). It is after the intervention of the Assyrian core, the necessary reference point, that the chaotic totality is changed into a cosmic totality.”182
4.6 The Assyrian Capital as the Epitome of the Empire
The approach to kingship and to royal control of the inhabited world described above presupposes an interconnectedness of city, territory, and cosmos, and a correspondence between the macro- and microcosm. This relatedness is reflected in the urban design of Assyrian cities and in the conception of the city as a nexus or mirror of the cosmos per se. Sargon’s city of Akkad already appears as a synecdoche for the whole empire in ancient historiography, as is clear in the Curse of Akkad183 and in other Sumerian city laments. These texts deplore the destruction of specific cities even though the events they describe relate to the collapse of the polities represented by these cities, namely the Akkad and Ur III empires. The notion of the city as a synecdoche for the state persists into the first millennium, as the city of Aššur epitomizes the local deity Aššur and the broader Assyrian polity throughout Assyrian history. Major social tensions were therefore presumably in play when Tukultī-Ninurta I attempted to move Aššur’s cult to his newly built residence Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta184 or when Sargon II founded his new capital Dūr-Šarru-kēn on pristine ground. The precise character of these tensions will unfortunately remain opaque to us. Although it has been speculated that the cities of the Luwian/Aramaic kingdoms in northwestern Syria might have informed the urban design of the Assyrian capitals,185 it is also possible that the city of Aššur, which was set on a natural terrace above the Tigris River and developed over millennia, provided

the model for the later Assyrian capitals.186 The fortress-like nature of Aššur’s acropolis, which was segregated from the rest of the city by an additional wall (fig. 24), was reinforced by the city’s location on a river bank and at the highest point in the landscape. Due to climatic conditions and in particular to the prevailing northwesterly winds, the acropolis in Aššur was located in the northwestern part of the city. The northern portion of the city included the palace, temples, and residential quarters occupied mainly by high officials and professionals. This spatial organization helped to foster the distinction in status between the elites and the rest of the people and monumentalized the social order. Aššur’s urban layout thus reflected the relationship between the gods, the king, and the people. In the city of Nineveh, which also developed over millennia, we find the additional distinction between a citadel on Kujunjik that encompasses palaces and temples and the arsenal located on a different mound, Nebi Yunus (fig. 25).

The city of Nimrud has a similar arrangement, as its citadel is separated from the arsenal at Fort Shalmaneser, which is located on another tell (figs. 26 and 27). Both the fortified character of Aššur’s acropolis and the sharp spatial division between the citadel and the arsenal attested in Nineveh and Nimrud contributed to Sargon II’s design for his newly founded capital Khorsabad/DūrŠarru-kēn (figs. 28a and 28b). Despite the fact that palaces and temples are architecturally distinct, their close connection in Assyria was enhanced by the spatial link between the temple of Nabû, which in Aššur housed the divine seal of the god Aššur, and the palace.187 Sargon II went so far as to build a bridge between the temple of

inauguration of his new residence with a banquet,191 as is related by Aššurnaṣirpal II in his Banquet Stele.192 This stele also lists a range of exotic woods brought into Assyria from all corners of the world, bespeaking a new metaphor for the notion of cosmic control:
I founded therein a palace of boxwood, meskannu-wood, cedar, cypress, terebinth, tamarisk, mehru-wood, eight palace (area)s as my royal residence (and) for my lordly leisure (and) decorated (them) in a splendid fashion. I fastened with bronze bands doors of cedar, cypress, daprānu-juniper, boxwood (and) meskannu-wood (and) hung (them) in their doorways. I surrounded them with knobbed nails of bronze. I depicted in greenish glaze on their walls my heroic praises, in that I had gone right across highlands, lands (and) seas, (and) the conquests of all lands.193
Numerous Sumerian cosmologies focus on the city as the structure of order and civilization, distinguishing it from the uncivilized and unstructured realm. The city is further sacralized in mythology, which attributes its origin to the gods. In the first millennium version of the Etana Myth, the gods are credited with designing the city and with laying its foundations:194
[They] designed a city, [The great] gods laid its foundation. [They] designed the exalted city of Kiš, [The great] gods laid its foundation, The Igigi made its brickwork firm. (Etana i 1‒5)
According to theological texts the idea of the city hailed from the very beginning of history, with the “city of primordial times” listed in divinized and personalized form among the ancestor gods of Anu in the great god list. Although several kings built new cities or totally rebuilt existing ones to serve as their capitals, they never boasted of having founded an entirely new city.195 Rather, they commemorated the construction of particular buildings or of the city walls. In other words, they represented their building activities as an extension of a pre-existing city. In his record of the construction of DūrŠarru-kēn/Khorsabad, his new residence, Sargon II for the first time in Mesopotamian history challenged this traditional weltanschauung by emphasizing how

The Assyrian Capital as the Epitome of the Empire 189
he himself “selected the site, made the plans and supervised the work.”196 By comparing himself to the wise sage Adapa, Sargon II presented the city as a project of his own mind, affirming that the “measure of the city walls represents a numerical cryptographic writing of his name”:197
16,280 cubits, the numeral of my name, I established as the measure of its wall and I set its foundation on a solid bedrock.198
As Marc van de Mieroop notes, he thus “embedded his identity into the very fabric of the city.”199 Further, Sargon II introduces the idea of a city plan written in the stars through the rebus-writing of his name on the glazed bricks of the temple facades, which probably represented five signs of the zodiac (lumaššū).200 This divine city plan is then claimed by Sargon II’s son, King Sennacherib, for his residence in Nineveh.201 Still more, Sargon II stresses the primordial aspect of his work by harking back to the language of creation used to describe Marduk’s formation of the universe:
The opening of the city-gates of Dūr-Šarru-kēn is described in the same terms as the layout of the gates of the universe in the Enuma elish. Sargon II states: ina rēše u arkate ina ṣēlē killalān miḫret 8 šārī 8 abullāti aptema, “in front and back on both sides, I opened up eight city-gates into the eight wind-directions”, while the Enuma elish has this line: iptema abullāti ina ṣēlē killalān, “he opened up gates in both ribcages.” The term ṣēlu used here as the basic meaning of rib, which does actually reflect the side of the body. That the phraseology used by Sargon is clearly intended to refer to the Creation Epic is demonstrated by the fact that what he says does not accurately reflect his work. The city plan of Dūr-Šarru-kēn shows that there are two gates each in three of the city walls, while the fourth wall, where the citadel is located, has only one gate. The Akkadian ṣēlē killalān “both sides” thus cannot refer to the city, while it perfectly well represents the two sides of the vault of heaven, each with one gate to let the stars and planets pass through. This may explain the rather awkward statement by Sargon that he built eight gates in the eight wind directions.202

190 Empire as Cosmos, Cosmos as Empire
The configurational understanding of the Assyrian political landscape in which the empire was coextensive with the cosmos is expressed in the names that Sargon II gave to the city gates of his newly founded capital Dūr-Šarru-kēn. In these names, the built environment of the royal capital is mythologized by an explicit association of all the gates with the gods:
66 Toward the front and back, and on either side, toward the four winds, I opened eight gates.
67 “Šamaš Makes my Might Prevail,” “Adad Establishes its Abundance,” I called the gates of Šamaš and Adad which face the east.
68 “Bēl Establishes the Foundation of my City,” “Bēlit Increases Plenty,” I named the gates of Bēl and Bēlit which face north.
69 “Anu Prospers the Work of my Hands,” “Ištar Enriches his People,” I gave as names to the gates of Anu and Ištar which face the west.
70 “Ea Makes its Springs Flow Abundantly,” “Bēlit-ilāni Spreads Abroad her Offspring,” I called the names of the gates of Ea and Bēlit-ilāni which face the south.
71 “Aššur Makes the Years of the King, Its Builder, Grow Old and Guards its Troops” was the name of its wall, “Ninurta Establishes the Foundation Platform for his City for All Time to Come,” was the name of its outer wall.203
In their vertical association with the divine world, the names of the city gates of Dūr-Šarru-kēn read like abbreviated blessings or wishes in which the gods continuously ensure the prosperity and security of the city. The directional references are not topographical but point to the four cardinal directions, evoking a cosmic extension of the city, which reflects the king’s claim to universal rule. As such, the programmatic message of the ceremonial names of the city gates of Dūr-Šarru-kēn focuses exclusively on the political-theological dimension of the king’s alliance with the Assyrian pantheon.204 Sargon II’s ceremonial names for his capital’s city gates contrast starkly with the known names of the city gates of Aššur and Nineveh. In these cities, the names of city gates carried a political-ideological or a theological message, or expressed a functional relationship between the city walls and the topography of the city, or related the city to its geopolitical surroundings.205 Political and theological messages as well as the expression of functional relationships appear to have prevailed in
203 Fuchs 1993, 42 f. and 294 f. 204 The same homogeneous picture is evident in the ceremonial names of the city gates of Babylon, which although not founded anew in the time of the redaction of Tintir.ki must at some point have been assigned a homogenous list of city gates, see George 1992, 199. 205 Pongratz-Leisten 1994, 25‒31.

the names of the city gates of Aššur. In Nineveh, by contrast, there appears to have been more of an emphasis on the political-theological and broader geographical aspects that linked the city with the world surrounding it, while ceremonial names referring to the inner life of the city were less frequently represented. Founding a new city was considered a primordial act of creation by the gods; when performed by a king, it was regarded as an act of hubris. Sargon II’s contemporaries criticized him by drawing an analogy with Sargon of Akkad in the so-called Weidner Chronicle. In this text, the building of Sargon’s capital Akkad is presented as a sacrilege which led to punishment by the gods: “The simultaneity of the appearance of new stories about Sargon of Agade and the acts of the Assyrian king could obviously be coincidental, but it seems likely to me that we have here a condemnation of Sargon of Assyria’s project by his own contemporaries through analogy with the ancient king.”206
4.7 Excursus: The Babylonian Map of the World
Although probably written in Borsippa during the eighth or seventh century BCE, the Babylonian Map of the World is another document that reflects Assyrian cosmography. It is a unique exemplar of cultural tradition that combines concrete geographical knowledge and mythic notions (figs. 29a and b) to form a cosmogram, in which the meaning of place names is not merely referential. The map represents a figurative conceptualization of space indicating constellations of political power.207 The following considerations attempt to retrace the various cognitive and cultural skills as well as the body of tradition necessary for the creation of this map. As part of their lexical tradition, the Sumerians from early on collected geographical knowledge in their compilations of lists of words by category, which also included lists of towns, mountains, and rivers. As with any other section in these “encyclopedias,” these entries are categorized by means of semantic indicators (determinatives) “such as those for country, city, river and field.”208 In contrast to our modern communication paradigm, which is oriented toward geographical location, these geographic lists tell us nothing in that regard. Lists from Ebla and Abu Salabikh represent the earliest examples of

compilations of geographical knowledge,209 and the tradition was subsequently canonized in the large compendium ur5.ra=hubullu and its commentaries. In addition to geographical lists of this kind there are topographical lists, including the famous lists of the cities of Babylon, Aššur, and Nippur.210 These texts can list the names of the temples and the gods living in them, as well as the names of shrines, streets, canals, and city walls; temple lists should also be included among these sorts of compilations.211 Within this larger framework, it is also possible to consider the cadastre lists including the late census list of Harran.212 Written sources concerning geographical perception and the conception of space are numerous, but graphic representations are far less common and only some plans of houses and temples213 and several maps of cities and fields survive.214 As William Hallo points out, all of these plans and maps served a prac

tical purpose, namely to establish ownership.215 Richard Zettler’s matching of the Kassite map of the city of Nippur with the modern excavation plan demonstrates that the ancients were quite capable of drawing a map that was true to scale.216 Another body of practical geographical texts is nearer our modern notion of functional geographical information. These are the itineraries, which originated in the contexts of military campaigns and trade. By indicating the “actual distances between major halting places in terms of days or double-hours,”217 these itineraries testify to the “awareness of greater distances and spatial relationships.”218 They do not, however, have any function in their own right. As is insinuated by the insertion of itineraries into annals, they should be interpreted as part of the process of mastering or taking control over a particular territory.219 Detailed knowledge of the controlled territory was critical to military operations, the movement of military units, and the transport of missives, letters, and messages throughout the empire. Due to the different nature of texts incorporating geographic knowledge, propagandistic in the case of annals and practical in the case of epistolary literature, they complement each other in reconstructing the geographical world as conceived by their authors.220 The important conclusion drawn from these texts by Sabrina Favaro is that ancient travelers oriented themselves according to the relationship between localities rather than according to the cardinal directions. Favaro argues that the ancients did not have a holistic concept of the landscape; instead, they envisioned the world as a homogenous surface connected by a network of roads.221 If the king penetrated beyond familiar territory and traversed the borders marked by the steles of his predecessors, his military expedition became a heroic cosmic journey that secured his prestige and immortal fame. Marching beyond the borders of known territory is a recurrent topos of the Assyrian royal inscriptions in particular. Awareness of scale and spatial relationships, however, was not the primary determinant that shaped the Babylonian Map of the World,222 which is the only map that comes close to reflecting a conception of the universe.

an Map of the World combines text and image, i.e. linguistic and visual imagery. It does not present a clear message according to a primarily functional communication paradigm.223 Rather, the map depicts configurational knowledge gained through increasing experience of the environment,224 and combines this knowledge with a mythical perspective on the universe. It brings together two different orientations: one that makes use of geographical features like the Euphrates as reference points, and one that establishes relationships between well-known cities and countries. A third purpose of this map was probably to locate and describe distant mythical regions by situating them in relation to familiar locales, such as Babylon, Assyria, and the Euphrates.225 Further, the map appears to have been oriented northwest-southeast, an orientation that is known from both Assyrian and Sumerian temples, the latter probably providing the model for the Assyrian tradition.226 The northwest-southeast orientation of Sumerian and Assyrian temples stands in contrast to the northsouth orientation of Babylonian temples. Thus, it is interesting to observe that although the text of the Babylonian Map of the World is written in Babylonian, the orientation of the map is inspired by Assyrian tradition. On the map, the northern mountains (1) represent the origin of the Euphrates River. The Euphrates in turn traverses the city of Babylon (13), which is drawn as an oblong near the center of the map, and then empties into the swamps (7) by the city of Susa (8), which is shown to the “east” of the swamps and is connected to the Persian Gulf by a canal (9). Simultaneously, the map suggests a rough division of Mesopotamia into territories located to the east of the Euphrates, such as Urartu (3), Assyria (4), and Der (5), and those located to its west, namely Bīt Habban (12) and Bīt Yakin (10). Der (5) is on the border of Elam, mirroring its historic position as the strategic starting point for campaigns against Elam. Susa (8), the capital of Elam, was also accessible from Bīt Yakin (10), located to the east of the Euphrates and the swamps (7). Bīt Habban regularly stirred up revolts against the Assyrians by conniving with the Babylonians and was therefore often the target of Assyrian military campaigns.227 A Babylon-centric weltanschauung is apparent in the fact that these reference points are depicted in a symmetrical way on both sides of the Euphrates, while the map omits the Tigris River altogether, even though it was closer to them.

Indeed, Babylon is located near the center of the map, while all the other locations reflect the status of satellites. Beyond the continental portion of the inhabited world, i.e. beyond the mountains of the sunrise and sunset, the map outlines the saltwater river, called marratu, the “bitter one.” In the Babylonian conception of the universe heaven and earth do not have a meeting point,228 and in order to reach heaven from earth one must pass either through the air, as is the case in the Etana Myth, or the sea, as is described in the Adapa Myth. In the Babylonian Map of the World, eight distant regions (nagû) originally radiated from the saltwater river, indicated by triangular protrusions. Of these protrusions, only five are preserved. In Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions, the term nagû functions either as a general designation for an area that is remote from the Assyrian core and by extension, a foreign territory – or it has a political meaning that refers to administrative districts or provinces.229 The latter meaning is not applicable to the Babylonian Map of the World, but the former is closely related to the meaning of the term in literary texts, where it is used to denote extremely distant regions, as is the case in the Gilgameš Epic.230 In the Babylonian Map of the World, one of the distant regions to the northeast represented by a triangular protrusion is labeled, “Great Wall: 6 leagues in between where the Sun is not seen.”231 Although this label is only written within this one region, its description can apply equally to the other nagûs, implying the transition from the cosmos to a sphere that resembles the primordial state that precedes creation. In the text that accompanies the Babylonian Map of the World, numerous intertextual references are made to literary works. Notable among these are the references to Enūma Eliš through Marduk’s banishment of the vanquished monsters to the sea, to the Gilgameš Epic through the naming of Utnapištim,232 the survivor of the Flood who resides across the ocean at the edge of the world, and to the historical epic of the King of Battle (šar tamḫari), through the citation of the names of Sargon, king of Akkad, and his opponent, Nūr-Dagan.233 In this way, the obverse of the tablet relates distant places to the mythical and historical figures mentioned in the text. The reverse of the tablet describes

conditions in these far-away regions, which represent the transition into unknown space. Accordingly, text and image intersect in the Babylonian Map of the World, which not only organizes and interprets spatial information, but also symbolically represents the transition from historical real space to the mythic space of the distant regions (nagû). In text and imagery, an expanded cosmography controlled by the divine and earthly king provides the model for control obtained through battle and conquest. In this way, the ideal empire becomes coextensive with the cosmos.234

5 Narratives of Power and the Assyrian Notion
of Kingship
5.1 The Title ‘King’ and its Implications
In Chapter Three, the Sumerian terms used to express the notion of political leadership, namely en, ensi2, and lugal, were referred to as part of the discussion of the similarities between the titularies of the kings of Aššur and those of Ešnunna. The precise meaning of these Sumerian terms varies according to time and place. Nevertheless, when they are used to designate the role of the sovereign, modern scholarship generally assumes that they were local variants expressing the same essential concept: the term lugal was used in Ur, en in Uruk, and ensi2in Lagaš. 1 I do not intend to dispute this interpretation, but I would like to illuminate what ‘political leadership’ signified in the ancient Mesopotamian weltanschauung. Additionally, I would like to point out that the relationship between the divine world and the institution of kingship might have been conceived of slightly differently within ideological discourse depending on geographical regions and historical periods. It is important to note that neither the title en nor the title lugal appear in the Archaic List of Professions as transmitted from Uruk,2 which has been understood to reflect the social hierarchy of that city. Instead, a figure designated as namešda heads the list, a title that was equated in later lists with the Akkadian šarru, ‘king’. Because the sign for namešda is composed of the elements nam2+ giš.šita (‘weapon,’ read éšda), it is tempting to link this written evidence with the iconographic evidence of the ‘prisoner scenes’ in both the Uruk IV glyptic and in the Lion Hunt Stele, which portray a ruler protecting the community in the contexts of war and hunting.3 In the Archaic List of Professions, the sign en appears only in conjunction with other signs to designate particular professions. It is not until the Early Dynastic period that the title en is used to designate a leader who assumes sacral and economic functions in administering the properties of the temples,4 and who functions in Uruk as the “chief temple administrator chosen by the gods for his managerial competence.”5 This later written evidence resonates with the visual message transmitted on the Uruk Vase, which depicts the ruler

The Title ‘King’ and its Implications 199
successfully executing the duties of his office by promoting prosperity and abundance and thereby providing for the material needs of the temple. The Early Dynastic documents of Ur, Abu Salabikh, and Šuruppak represent the lugal engaged in military activities, taking care of the temples, performing justice, and supervising agricultural activities, including animal husbandry and the maintenance of irrigation systems.6 In Lagaš, on the other hand, rulers used both the title lugal and ensi2,7 while in northern Syria en denoted the local ruler of the city of Ebla and lugal was used to designate the governor,8 a tradition that is still apparent in Late Bronze Age Emar.9 Only during the Sargonic period did en begin representing the title of a high-level cultic specialist,10 at the same time that the kings of Akkad continued to use the Sumerian lugal (lit. “great man”), equated with Akkadian šarru, to describe themselves. The adoption of the title ‘king of Kīš’ around 2600 BCE in the Early Dynastic II period, which plays on the homophony of the city name Kīš and the Akkadian word for ‘totality’ (kiššatu), constitutes the oldest known attempt to express the superiority of one ruler among the rulers of the other city states. By the Sargonic period, the title lugal kiš(ki) had become iconic.11 In contrast to the historical reality of the early city states competing with each other for hegemony, the mythological tradition of the Sumerian King List, according to which kingship (nam-lugal) originated in heaven, could only allow one “legitimate locus of kingship at any one time,”12 a position that circulated “among a restricted number of cities.”13 The Sumerian King List excludes Lagaš from the group of privileged cities that are said to have exercised hegemony at some point, and it is possible that the political text The Rulers of Lagaš was produced in response to this exclusion. This text, which was likely commissioned under King Gudea of Lagaš, declares the primacy of the office of the ensi2over the office of the lugal by referring to the city states of the Sumerian King List:14
When Anu (and) Enlil called mankind by name and established rulership (nam-ensi2) kingship (nam lugal), the crown, the throne and ... they had not yet sent forth from above.

200 Narratives of Power and the Assyrian Notion of Kingship
In the above passage, the textual evidence supports the modern view that the various Sumerian terms for leaders all denoted rulership per se. The passage also helps account for why the Akkadian term šarru was equated with numerous Sumerians titles by the Old Babylonian period. Modern scholarship has generally focused on these terms only in their denotation of political leadership, neglecting the broader dimensions of Mesopotamian kingship. Importantly, texts like The Rulers of Lagaš also indicate that despite their similarity, Sumerian terms for leaders had different connotations in different religious or geographic contexts. In the Old Babylonian Sumerian composition Inanna and Enki, nam-en and nam-lugal appear in the list of me stolen by Inanna from her father Enki. This demonstrates that nam-en “en-ship” and nam-lugal/šarrūtu “kingship” were regarded as part of the cosmic principles and cultic norms (me) of the time.15 In Inanna and Enki, the office of nam-en is listed at the top of the hierarchy of the important offices in Sumerian society, along with the office of the lagalpriest and the concept of divinity (nam-dingir).16 It is possible that this remarkable arrangement reflects an Old Babylonian reception of earlier historical reality. Kingship is named only after these offices, and it is first deconstructed into some of its representative elements, among them the insignia of kingship – the lofty legitimate tiara (aga zid mah), the throne of kingship (gišgu-za nam-lugal), the scepter (gidru mah), staff, and crook (ešgiri sibir), and the royal dress ([tug2] mah) – and one of the important functions of kingship, namely shepherdship. The actual office of kingship (nam-lugal) only appears at the end of this long list.
Inanna and Enki17
1 dinana nam-en [ba-e-de6] Inana, [you brought with you] the office of the en-priest, 2 nam-lagal [ba-e-de6] [you have brought with you] the office of the lagal-priest, 3 nam-dingir [ba-e-de6] [you have brought with you] divinity,
15 For a critical perspective on this interpretation of the ME’s see Glassner 1992; Glassner prefers to interpret the ME’s as characteristic traits of Inanna. 16 This interpretation could be corroborated by Steinkeller’s hypothesis that the phenomenon of twin capitals in the early Sumerian city states – a religious center and a political center is a secondary development, and that in an earlier state the religious center was simultaneously the seat of political power, which combined cultic and military duties in one leader figure, the en. Over time this enlost his power to the rising representative of the new political center, the ensi2, see Steinkeller 1999, 115. 17 Farber-Flügge 1973, 54 f.; ETCSL 1.3.1.

4 aga zid mah [ba-e-de6] [you have brought with you] the legitimate and exalted crown,18 5 gišgu-za nam-lugal-la ba-〈e-de6〉 [you have brought with you] the royal throne, 6 gidru mah ba-〈e-de6〉 you have brought with you] the exalted scepter, 7 ešgiri sibir ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] the staff and crook, 8 [tug2] mah ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] the noble dress, 9 nam-sipad ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] shepherdship, 10 nam-lugal ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] kingship, 11 nam-egi2-zi ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] the office of the egi-zi-priest, 12 nam-nin-dingir ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] the office of the nin-dingir-priestess, 13 nam-išib ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] the office of the išib-priest, 14 nam-lu2-mah ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] the office of the lumah-priest 15 nam-gudu4 ba-〈e-de6〉 you have [brought with you] the office of the gudu-priest.
The list continues with the offices of five other cultic specialists, including that of the nin-dingir-priestess, an office that kings are known to have bestowed on their daughters, and that of the išib-priest, a title that kings used themselves to express their close relationship with the gods. The level of detail that accompanies the office of kingship – nam-lugal – communicates the constituent elements of kingship to the text’s audience and points to its author’s knowledge of tradition, as the list demonstrates an intertextual relationship with both the Sumerian Šulgi Hymn X and with the Akkadian Etana Myth. These insignia are not only conferred on the king by a variety of deities in other mythological texts, thus anchoring the institution of kingship in the divine world, but they are also subject to particular rites that secure succession to the office, as is discussed in Chapter Ten. Three interrelated aspects of the list of the me recorded in Inanna and Enki require further comment. First, the list identifies the institution of kingship as being part of the me, i.e. the institutions, offices, and forms of human behavior that are inherent to and inform the social and cosmic order. Second, the list demonstrates that the office of kingship, although distinguished by its various attributes, cannot be separated from offices tied to the administration of the temple and the performance of the cult. Third, the list reiterates the close relationship between Inanna/Ištar and the institution of kingship through the in

clusion of kingship among the me that are stolen by Inanna. This link was perpetuated in the Old Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian versions of the Etana Myth and resurfaces in other media, notably prophecy, in which Ištar functions as the voice of the gods on behalf of the king in the Diyala region in the Old Babylonian period and later in Assyria.19 Crucially, all of the offices listed in Inanna and Enki are linked with the temple in either an administrative or cultic function, except for the term namlugal (‘kingship’), which denotes political leadership. The variety of these offices implies a division of labor among various functionaries in the socio-political reality of southern and northern Mesopotamia. Simultaneously, the inclusion of some of these offices as titles in the titularies of certain kings should be understood an expression of their intimacy with the divine world and their deep involvement in both the affairs of the temple and in the cult of the gods of territories over which they exercised control, rather than as an indication of the heightened religious sensibilities of a particular ruler. As such, epithets like “išib/išippu-priest of Anu” should be interpreted as elaborations on titles that signify the geographical expansion of territorial control. This becomes apparent, for example, in the inscriptions of the Middle Assyrian king TukultīNinurta I (1233‒1197 BCE), who inserts this title immediately after the titles “king of Assyria, king of Sumer and Akkad,” claiming in this particular case Uruk as the southernmost point of Assyrian control:
Tukultī-Ninurta, king of the universe, strong king, king of Assyria, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters, chosen of the gods Aššur and Šamaš, I, attentive prince, the king (who is) the choice of the god Enlil, the one who shepherded his land in green pastures with his beneficial staff, foremost purification priest (išippu), designate of the god Anu, ...”20

In addition to contextualizing the term lugal/šarru and the religious implications of the office, it is also necessary to situate the title šangû in Assyrian culture, as it is exclusive to Assyrian royal ideology. Unlike in the Babylonian

context where the primary function of the sanga/šangû was to act as the chief administrator of a temple, in Assyria his duties lay primarily with the performance of the cult, even though the šangû remained the principal figure associated with a temple.21 The Aššur temple was headed by a šangû rabiu (“high priest”), whose central role was appropriated by the king in the performance of state rituals; the šangû rabiu was assisted by a colleague, the šangû šaniu (“second priest”). Every temple other than the Aššur temple had only one šangû, who was responsible for all the divinities residing in that temple. There are a few attestations of a šangû named Elalī already in Old Assyrian texts, but the precise character of his position in that period remains opaque.22 Šangû priests can be associated with a divinity (ša DN), a temple (ša É) or a city (ša GN), the latter indicating the šangû’s high status among the functionaries of the urban community. The title was written with the logogram sanga,23 the same sign as šid/iššiʾakku (“steward, governor”). When the title was applied to the king, it served to express his stewardship of the god Aššur. It was, however, only under king Aššur-uballiṭ I (1353‒1318 BCE) that the title šangû was introduced into the royal titulary.24 This programmatic change in Assyrian royal ideology might have been a consequence of growing HittiteAssyrian interaction during the fourteenth century BCE, as the Assyrian understanding of the functions and duties of the šangû are more reminiscent of Hittite than Babylonian practice.25 There are several known instances in which the Hittite crown prince was installed as šangû of the storm god of either Kizzuwatna26 or Nerik27 and of Ištar of Samuha,28 who are the principal deities of the Hittite pantheon. Aššur-uballiṭ I’s introduction of the title šangû in relation to Assyria’s supreme god Aššur was contemporaneous with the major expansion of the city of Aššur at the beginning of the Middle Assyrian period and appears to be inspired by the Hittite model in its delineation of the king’s special relationship with the supreme divinity of the local pantheon. Like the title iššiʾakku, the title šangû was used in construct from, generally coupled with

the divine name Aššur, though it does occasionally occur with the gods Enlil and Ištar. Peter Machinist has discussed with great sagaciousness the three titles that are commonly attested together for Assyrian kings beginning in the second millennium BCE and carrying through to the end of Assyrian history.29 These titles are iššiʾak/iššâk dAššur, šakin/šakni/šakan/šaknu dEnlil, and sanga, which entered the titulary of Assyrian kings at different points in history. Iššiʾak/iššâk dAššur is the oldest of the three titles, appearing already in the oldest royal inscriptions from Aššur, which date to the Akkad period. The title šakin dEnlil was introduced by Šamšī-Adad I (1808‒1776 BCE) and relied on the Old Akkadian model. Finally, as mentioned above sanga/šangû was introduced in the Middle Assyrian period. Machinist notes that despite the chronological range of these titles, “all three terms appear to express in one way or another the notion of ‘administrator, acting as a representative of higher authority,’ in this instance, the king as administrative representative of the god to whom the term is attached.”30 The use of the dating formula ina šurru šangûtiya (“in the beginning of my šangûtu/šangû-ship”) to mark a king’s accession year, which is semantically parallel to the formula ina rēš šarrūtiya (“in the beginning of my kingship”), demonstrates that šangûtu was understood as a synonym for ‘kingship,’ šarrūtu. Although Assyrian ritual texts associated with the state rituals refer to the king as šarru and relate that he was assisted by the chief šangû of the Aššur temple, in royal ideology the king retains his position as the chief šangû of Aššur. This notion, as Machinist reminds us, is clearly expressed in the prayer performed by the chief šangû when crowning the king in the Coronation Ritual, which survives in a copy from the Middle Assyrian period:
May Aššur and [M]ullissu, the owners of your crown, co[v]er you with your crown for a hundred years! May your feet be good in the temple and your hands be good [a]t he breast of Aššur, your God! May your šangûtu and that of your sons be pleasing to Aššur, your God! Expand your country with your just scepter! May Aššur give you [c]ommand and attention, obedience, truth and peace!31
The juxtaposition of šangûtu with the command to expand the borders of Assyria confirms the understanding of the term as a synonym for ‘kingship.’ This interpretation is further supported by the formula “the gods Ninurta and Nergal who love my šangûtu” (dNinurta u dPalil ša šangûtī irammū) introduced by

Aššur-bēl-kala (1073‒56 BCE)32 and reiterated in the inscriptions of Aššurdan II (934‒912 BCE),33 Adad-nīrārī II (911‒891 BCE),34 Tukultī-Ninurta II (890884 BCE),35 Ashurnaṣirpal II (883‒859 BCE),36 and Shalmaneser III (858‒824 BCE).37 Indeed, the decision to associate the warrior gods with šangûtu is a variation on the same message and conveys the economic and martial dimensions of providing for the temple. The following passage from Šamšī-Adad V’s (823‒811 BCE) inscriptions illustrates the dual role of the šangû by combining the provisioning of the temple with the performance of the cult:
(Šamšī-Adad (V)) ... whose name the gods designated from ancient times, pure šangû who provides unremittingly for Ešarra (and) who maintains the rites of Ekur, who is dedicated heart and mind to the work of Ehursagkurkurra (and) the temples of his land.38
It should also be noted that Ninurta’s role as ‘governor of Enlil’ included both administrative and martial functions, which provided the model for the earthly king. As the Assyrian kings assumed the position of Ninurta in their relationship with Aššur, this double definition of Ninurta’s role in relation to divine leadership exemplifies the complex notion of the king’s šangûtu in Assyrian culture; this is further discussed in Chapter Six.
5.3 Anchoring the Institution of Kingship in the Mythical Past
This is not the place to reiterate in detail all the cosmologies from the early Sumerian debate literature or other text genres that contain cratogonies elaborating on the creation of kingship.39 What is important to note, however, is that in these early tales the city is founded by the gods before the creation of humanity and the establishment of kingship. Humanity and kingship are regarded as secondary developments that follow rather than precede the idea of

the city as a seat of the divinity. This ancient Sumerian notion of the sequence of creation persisted in the literary production of the first millennium BCE. It appears, for example, in the Standard Babylonian version of the Etana Myth, in which the gods plan and build the city of Kīš first and only afterwards decide to look for a king. Like in the list of the me in Inanna and Enki, kingship is described by its representative insignia: a specific headdress, the tiara, the scepter, and the throne, exemplifying the conception of kingship in Mesopotamian thought in terms of its characteristic parts. The insignia were not conceived merely as symbols of rulership, but rather as the essential material instruments necessary for the performance of rulership (simat šarrūti).40

Anchoring the Institution of Kingship in the Mythical Past 207
In addition to anchoring the creation of kingship within the larger framework of the creation of the city, the text provides an argument for the importance of the institution of kingship. It “argues” that the primary function of kingship was to maintain or restore the social order planned and intended by the gods. Accordingly, the text emphasizes the king’s function as shepherd, an image that entered the iconography of the cylinder seals.42 Shepherdship in this case means the ability to control the teeming populace in the sense of maintaining civic order and ensuring that everyone contributes to the wellbeing of the gods. A similar notion of how and why kingship came into being is apparent in the Akkadian debate poem The Datepalm and the Tamarisk, which was recovered from the library Šaduppum/Tell Harmal, i.e. in the cultural horizon of Ešnunna. Copies of this text also existed in Middle Assyrian/early Neo-Assyrian Aššur. Excavations at Emar have yielded a further exemplar, thus reflecting a Tigridian and northern Syrian adoption of a text that is ultimately rooted in Sumero-Babylonian tradition.43 The younger version of the text explicitly elaborates on the motifs of legendary time, the divine origin of civilization, how the gods built cities and performed irrigation work, and on the gathering of the divine assembly and its decision to create the institution of kingship. This cosmological introduction is followed by the debate between the two trees, which compete in their importance to the palace and the cult:
Šaduppum (OB) Emar/Aššur (MB/MA) In those days, On light days, dark nights, in distant years, in ... years, when the Igigu founded the land, when the gods had founded the land, the gods worked for the humans. built cities for the distant humans, heaped up mountains, dug the rivers, the life(force) of the lands They assembled, the gods of the land assembled.

208 Narratives of Power and the Assyrian Notion of Kingship
Reminiscent of the Atramhasīs tradition, Bēlet-ilī’s involvement in the creation of the king is explicitly mentioned in The Datepalm and the Tamarisk and provides a close link to the Myth of the Creation of Man and King, which dates to the first millennium and was originally found in Borsippa.45 The first part of this later text is very similar to the Atrahasīs Myth, describing the labor of the gods and their rebellion and then proceeding to the creation of humanity and the king. In the Myth of the Creation of Man and King, mankind is created to relieve the gods of the burden of their work, while the king’s function is to rule humanity and organize labor. The Myth of the Creation of Man and King is important for understanding ancient kingship, because it indicates that certain qualities were to be embodied in the person of the king, such as beauty, perfection, strength, ferocity, courage, and knowledge of the divine secret. These qualities enable the king to prevail over others and fulfill the responsibilities of his office.

In the Assyro-Babylonian weltanschauung corporal beauty and perfection were not virtues in their own right, but were instead a prerequisite for human interaction with the gods, as is evident in the performance of Assyrian queries to the sun god by the diviner. In other words, the perfection of the royal body was primarily intended to render the king a legitimate recipient of divine knowledge. This physical perfection was complemented by the king’s intellectual superiority, which he obtained by virtue of his being the “image of the god” (tamšīl ili)47 or the “flesh of the god” (šīr ili), and which enabled him to make good decisions that further ingratiated him to the gods. In myth, the king’s skill in decision-making is expressed by the participle form māliku, derived from the root malāku, “to give advice, to ponder, to come to a decision.”48 Māliku occurs in line 33′ of the Myth of the Creation of Man and King, where it appears to function as a pun for mal(i)ku “king,” derived from the West Semitic verb malāku “to reign.”49 Thus, although both the king and the lullû-man belong to the same species (awīlu), the king is distinguished from the lullû-man by virtue of his being a māliku who is appointed to the office of ruler (šarru).50 In line 37′, the author of the Myth of the Creation of Man and King expresses

the idea that battle was integral to the process of creation, and that it was conferred on the king by the great gods. The sacralization of the body of the king is further effected through the bestowal of the regalia of kingship by the gods, as Anu gives the king his crown and Enlil his throne. The king’s invincibility is in turn guaranteed by the weapons of Nergal and by Ninurta’s terrifying splendor (šalummatu). Bēlet-ilī provides the king with his perfect appearance, and Nusku stands ready to ensure the king’s intellectual superiority and wise decision-making, which enable him to rule humankind. Through its reference to the weapons of the warrior gods, the Myth of the Creation of Man and King represents kingship as having been created in order to pacify the world. Once he had proven his prowess in combat, the king was called upon by the gods to rule on the basis of his perfection in body and mind. As is discussed in more detail in Chapter Six, rulership implied assuming the role of Ninurta as the executive agent in the performance of power, both in its administrative aspect and with regard to establishing and protecting civic order. Accordingly, the myth articulates yet again the model of a successful ruler and the ideal image of his body politic, which was further negotiated in ritual and image.
5.4 The Assyrian Notion of the King’s Shepherdship (rēʾûtu) and Ashurbanipal’s Coronation Hymn
The preceding discussion covered the implications of the titles šarru and šangû, as well as the mythic foundations of the office of kingship in Mesopotamian tradition in general and in Assyrian royal ideology in particular; this provides a platform for investigating the trope of royal shepherdship, as the Assyrians adopted a very specific approach to the king’s role as shepherd. Modern scholarship tends to associate shepherdship primarily with the enactment of justice, probably under the impact of the imagery of the Hammurabi Stele. On closer inspection, however, it appears that this association only developed gradually. Legal authority can therefore be enacted on the divine level by the gods Ištaran, Šamaš, Adad, Ninurta, and Marduk, who assume the role of the divine judge without any explicit notion of shepherdship.51 In the Early Dynastic period Ištaran of Der witnessed the agreement between the city states of Umma and Lagaš regarding the control of water,52 a tradition that is still appar
51 For a survey on divine judges see Krebernik 2007. 52 Cooper 1986.



The Assyrian Notion of the King’s Shepherdship (rēʾûtu) 211
ent in Gudea’s building hymn, and by the Old Babylonian period the sun god Šamaš provides the model for the king’s earthly dispensation of justice. In the Sumero-Babylonian weltanschauung, the institution of kingship was designed to uphold the social order through the enforcement of both justice and correct human social behavior (Sumerian níg-si-sá/Akkadian mīšaru), so that the cosmic order (Sumerian níg-gi-na/Akkadian kittu) remained undisturbed.53 Kingship was thus the focal point at which the social and the cosmic order intersected. The ideal king was charged with meeting the needs of civil society and ensuring its proper functioning, as well as with providing for the cult of the gods and maintaining correct communication with them. In ideological discourse, the implicit purpose for the maintenance of social order was to guarantee the performance of human labor in the service of the gods. Pre-Sargonic rulers sometimes stated that they were destined for shepherdship over the people,54 a claim that is reflected in the onomasticon in names like ‘Enannatum-is-the-true-shepherd’ (En-na-na-túm-sipa-zi)55 and ‘the king is a shepherd’ (lugal-sipa). In Akkadian tradition, the sense of ‘in accordance with the divine order’ and ‘reliable in social relationships’ of the adjective ‘true’ – Sumerian zi/Akkadian kīnu – was linked with “king” (šarru) rather than with “shepherd” (rēʾû).56 Further, until Šulgi the Old Akkadian and Ur III kings made no use of the title “shepherd” in their inscriptions. In this case, as in many others, the local royal discourse of Lagaš represents an exception, as Gudea of Lagaš shared the title “shepherd” with Ningirsu and presented himself as the legitimate shepherd who is knowledgeable and capable of realizing things.57 Explicit mention is made of shepherdship in King Šulgi’s self-praise, where it appears in connection with the king’s enforcement of justice:
They (the Anuna-gods) made Šulgi’s shepherdship everlasting for me and made Šulgi, the righteous one of his god, rise over the land like Utu for me. They set up a throne of firm reign for him. The shepherd will decree just judgments and will make just decisions upon it (?). They granted (?) Šulgi a royal crown ....... great ....... (Šulgi P Fragm. C 58‒65)
In Sumero-Babylonian royal ideology the king’s role as judge was reinforced by the image of the king as protector of the weak and the oppressed, which is
53 The notion of mīšaru, derived from ešēru ‘to straighten out, to set right,’ comprises the performance of royal justice and correcting iniquitous situations, thereby guaranteeing the cosmic order (kittu), derived from the root kânu meaning ‘to be stable,’ see also Charpin 2010, 83; Démare-Lafont 2011, 335. 54 Steible and Behrens 1982, Ukg. 51: 1‒3, Luzag. 2:6. 55 Westenholz 2007, 307. 56 Westenholz 2007, 306. 57 Selz 2001, 16 f. with reference to Gudea Cyl.A 7:9‒12; 25:22; CylB 2:7 f.

212 Narratives of Power and the Assyrian Notion of Kingship
already attested in the inscriptions of the rulers of Lagaš. It is clear from the documentation of the Old Babylonian period, from which several royal edicts survive, that this was by no means merely a literary trope. The purpose of these edicts – generally proclaimed shortly after the king’s accession to the throne was threefold: canceling non-commercial debts, returning alienated goods to their former owners, and commanding the return of individuals to their original social status, which implied the remission of debt slavery.58 As Charpin writes, the royal edict:
thus appears to be the exercise of a duty toward justice that the gods themselves expected from the new king; it took the form of a ceremony during which the king brandished a gold torch. The gold torch was obviously a solar symbol, the king being explicitly compared to the rising sun. This is particularly significant given that the sun god, Shamash, was at the same time the god of justice. A recently published letter connects that ceremony to the end of the mourning period observed after the death of the previous king: ‘The king promulgated the ‘restoration’ [mīšarum] of the country; he lifted the gold torch for the country and put an end to the country’s mourning.’59
Although it is attested for several deities following the Ur III period, the epithet ‘shepherd,’ sipa/rēʾû, most often occurs as an epithet of the sun god Šamaš. Consequently, ‘shepherdship’ has been associated primarily with the enactment of legislation, in which the king’s verdict before his subjects is analogous to the sun god’s determination of man’s fate. Šulgi is, however, very ambiguous in this regard. He first couples the trope of royal justice with knowledge and military prowess and depicts himself as a king without rival, but then states that his heart has never committed violence against any king, thereby elaborating on the rhetoric first introduced by Gudea of Lagaš:
I have no equal among even the most distant rulers, and I can also state that my deeds are great deeds. Everything is achievable by me, the king. Since the time when Enlil gave me the direction of his numerous people in view of my wisdom(geštug2), my extraordinary power (á dirig) and my justice (nam-si-sá), in view of my resolute and unforgettable words, and in view of my expertise, comparable to that of Ištaran, in verdicts, my heart has never committed violence against even one other king, be he an Akkadian or a son of Sumer, or even a brute from Gutium.60
As is clear from the entry rēʾû in the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, the term can serve as a synonym for ‘ruler,’ as seems to be the case in one of Iddin-Dagan’s

The Assyrian Notion of the King’s Shepherdship (rēʾûtu) 213
hymns: “Iddin-Dagan, you are a shepherd (chosen by) his (Enlil’s) heart.”61 Similarly, in Hammurabi’s Law Code the king states: “I am Hammurabi, the shepherd called (to rule) by Enlil.”62 This title is combined with adjectival attributes and appositions like “I am the strong shepherd, the shepherd of the widespread people, I am the hero, the protector, who made secure the foundation of his father’s throne,”63 and statements like that of King Narām-Sîn in the Cuthean Legend, “I am a king who does not keep his country safe, a shepherd who does not keep his people safe.”64 The title also appears in the epithet chosen by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III, who is called “the shepherd of all foreign rulers.”65 The various contexts in which the term rēʾû figures all indicate that the primary task of the king as shepherd was to protect his people from any external threat or inner turmoil, in much the same way that a shepherd would be expected to protect his flock from wild animals. Hammurabi’s epithet ‘shepherd of the people’ (rēʾî nišī), which appears in the prologue to his Law Code (CH iv 45), reveals that shepherdship was intended for the people.66 This trope is also attested separately in Hammurabi’s Law Code, preceding the trope of the sun and the light as a metaphor for control over the four regions. Tukultī-Ninurta I’s epithet, “the one who shepherds the four quarters after Šamaš” (ša kibrat erbetti arki Šamaš irteʾʾu),67 is a new creation with imperialistic implications, as it alludes both to the implementation of civic order within the king’s own territory and to control over conquered peripheral regions. This claim to universal control is further apparent in Tukultī-Ninurta I’s decision to replace the established epithet “chosen of Aššur” (nišīt Aššur) with “chosen of Aššur and Šamaš” (nišīt Aššur u Šamaš), as is attested in inscriptions from his newly built residence in Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta.68 It is noteworthy in this regard that in his epic, Tukultī-Ninurta I still strives to strike a balance between controlling the land by force and being “attentive to the people’s voice, the counsel of the land,”69 a statement in which he distinguish

es between his own people and those people that are yet to be incorporated into his kingdom. The imperialistic claims and ambitions of Tukultī-Ninurta I’s new epithets represent the direct antecedent to Ashurbanipal’s Coronation Hymn, and the nuanced distinction between inner and outer control continues to be integral to its ideological message. Strikingly, the Coronation Hymn begins its invocation of the gods by referring to the sun god’s selection of the king ‘to shepherd the four regions,’ and only then invokes Aššur. Both gods, however, represent in the first instance the king’s imperialistic claims. Only after its introduction of Šamaš and Aššur does the hymn proceed to articulate the utopian vision of the just king who safeguards social order. As its name suggests, the Coronation Hymn is mainly hymnic in character, but the prescription for a cultic specialist on the third line of the tablet’s reverse side points to a cultic setting for the text, as does the blessing spoken at the moment of the king’s coronation. The ritual itself is performed before the sun god Šamaš, who is also the first god to be addressed in the introductory hymn:
The Coronation Hymn of Ashurbanipal,
1 May Šamaš, king of heaven and earth, elevate you to shepherdship over the four [region]s! 2 May Aššur, who ga[ve you [the scepter], lengthen your days and years! 3 Spread your land wide at your feet! 4 May Šerua extol [your name] to your god! 5 Just as grain and silver, oil, [the catt]le of Šakkan and the salt of Bariku are good, so may Aššurbanipal, king of Assyria, be agreeable to the gods [of his] land! 8 May command,70 attention,71 truth and justice be given to him as a gift! 9 May [the people] of Aššur buy 30 kor of grain for one shekel of silver! May [the peop]le of Aššur buy 3 seah of oil for one shekel of silver! May [the peop]le of Aššur buy 30 minas of wool for one shekel of silver! 12 May the lesser speak, and the [greater] listen! May the greater speak, and the [lesser] listen! May concord and peace be established [in Assyri]a! 15 Aššur is king – indeed Aššur is king! Aššurbanipal is the [representative] of Aššur, the creation of his hands. 16 May the great gods make firm his reign, may they protect the life [of Aššurba]nipal, king of Assyria 17 May they give him a straight scepter to extend the land and his peoples! 18 May his reign be renewed, and may they consolidate his royal throne for ever! 19 May they bless him (by) day, month, and year, and guard his reign! 20 In his years may there cons[tantly] be rain from the heavens and flood from the (underground) source!

r. 1 Give our lord Aššurbanipal long [days], copious years, strong [wea]pons, a long reign, y[ear]s of abundance, a good name, [fame], happiness and joy, auspicious oracles and leadership over (all other) kings! 3 After he has pronounced the blessing, he turns and pronounces the (following) blessing at the opening of the censer (placed) before Šamaš:
5 Anu gave his crown, Illil gave his throne; Ninurta gave his weapon; Nergal gave his luminous splendor. Nusku sent and placed advisers before him. 9 He who speaks with the king disloyally or treasonable – if he is a notable, he will die a violent death; if he is a rich man, he will become poor. 11 He who in his heart plots evil against the king – Erra will call him to account in a bout of plague. 13 He who in his heart utters improprieties against the king – his foundation is (but) wind, the hem of his garment is (but) litter. 15 Gather, all the gods of heaven and earth, bless king Aššurbanipal the circumspect man! 17 Place in his hand the weapon of war and battle, give him the black-headed people, that he may rule as their shepherd!72
Ashurbanipal’s coronation hymn is an outstanding example of the consolidation of tropes known from much earlier periods. The wish that ‘command, attention, truth, and justice’ (qabû šemû kettu u mēšaru, l. 8) be given to the king is reminiscent of the Middle Assyrian Coronation Ritual (Chapter 9.7), which expresses the same blessing at the moment when the šangû-priest crowns the king. This crystallizes the chaîne opératoire of the king’s interaction with his subjects, as the king gains both their attention (šemû) and the obedience (magāru) of his vassals by his command (qabû), thereby establishing the order and stability of the cosmos (kittu), as well as inner social order (mīšaru) and peace (salīmu).
The reference in Ashurbanipal’s Coronation Hymn to affordable prices for basic commodities (ll. 9‒11) mirrors similar statements that appear already in the prologues to the early law codes and in the royal inscriptions of ŠamšīAdad I and Daduša from the Old Babylonian period.73 Likewise, the utopian vision of the lesser speaking while the greater listen and the greater speaking while the lesser listen is a variation on a trope of social peace and equality that is already known from Gudea’s building hymn and Hammurabi’s Law Code.74 Lines 38′‒43′ of the Myth of the Creation of Man and King, which emphasize the divine origin of the royal insignia, are repeated literally in the last section

of Ashurbanipal’s Neo-Assyrian coronation ritual.75 Ashurbanipal’s invocation of the sun god Šamaš is inextricably linked to his claim to universal control. As a concept of Assyrian kingship, this notion is materialized further in the statue ‘Sun-of-the-Lands’ (A[L]AM! dšam-šu KUR.MEŠ), which is mentioned among the gods of the Aššur temple in a version of the Assyrian banquet ritual tākultu76 that also dates to the time of Ashurbanipal. The Coronation Hymn establishes only a secondary association with the king’s function as preserver of justice, which is derived from the Sumero-Babylonian role of the sun god.77 An important point of divergence is the imagery of a Neo-Assyrian helmet that depicts the coronation scene, as it portrays the gods Aššur and Ištar/Mullissu as the ones who give the king the insignia of kingship (fig. 30). The concept of the king as judge is absent from Assyrian royal ideology after the Old Assyrian period, reappearing only under the Sargonids.78 In the intervening periods, Assyrian kings did not interfere in legal processes but delegated the administration of justice to the governors, the sukkallu, and the sartennu, who dispensed justice within the regular administrative framework.79 Direct appeals to the authority of the king (abat šarri ‘word of the king’) regarding oppression at the hands of the administration were not within the remit of the legal system.80 Thus, in a highly sophisticated and com

Conclusion: The Political and Religious Dimensions of Assyrian Kingship 217
plex way, the solarization of Assyrian rulership in Ashurbanipal’s Coronation Hymn combined the Assyrian and Babylonian concepts of kingship.
5.5 Conclusion: The Political and Religious Dimensions of Assyrian Kingship
Closer inspection of various Mesopotamian myths demonstrates that the ancient weltanschauung does not recognize the modern division between the king’s political and cultic duties, which are generally separated into the roles of political leader and priest in scholarly jargon. As shown above, the terms iššiʾakkû and šangû could both be used to designate the office of kingship, and both incorporated administrative and cultic duties. The role of priest and the role of political leader were mutually dependent: the king had to pacify and secure the inhabited world by eliminating dangerous animals that threatened the herds and through military action against the enemies of Assyria, and only when this had been achieved could the king take proper care of his subjects and the cult. The structure of the Assyrian royal inscriptions, which divides the narrative into the description of the hunt, the military report, and only then the building account (see Chapter Six), provides implicit proof for this weltanschauung in its very organization. Although references to military conquests can be found in Sumerian and Babylonian inscriptions, the strict sequence of royal action stated above – hunt, warfare, and the building of temples – is typically Assyrian, as is its articulation in royal inscriptions. A close reading of Assyrian royal inscriptions reveals that the conquest of the ‘chaotic’ outer world was an essential prerequisite for the construction of the empire’s cultic infrastructure. Accordingly, reports of military campaigns and of the hunting of wild animals – both signifying battle against disorder – always precede the building account in inscriptions dating from the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I (1114‒1076 BCE) onwards. Similarly, the Middle Assyrian king Arik-dēn-ili (1307‒1296 BCE) “argues” that it is only after building the temples for the gods – subsequent to his pacification of the land – that the king can expect divine reward in the form of prosperity, which is manifest in good harvests:

218 Narratives of Power and the Assyrian Notion of Kingship
The texts examined in this chapter illuminate the cultural reasoning that informs the actions taken by kings in anticipation of divine reward. It is essential to pay attention to the particular choices made in royal titularies and to the distinctive structure of texts, which establish the king’s agency and make an argument in their own right. This approach makes the modern reading of Assyrian royal inscriptions at once more interesting and more enlightening, so that it becomes possible to determine under what socio-political conditions kings chose certain tropes for their self-presentation. These tropes will be explored in the following Chapters Six and Seven.

6.1 The Typification of Royal Roles: Homogeneity in Action between the Gods and the King
According to the colophon of the Old Babylonian Gilgameš Epic, which refers to the legendary hero as the “surpassing one,” prowess and virility were favored over all other qualities as the chief characteristics of the king. The flawless physique of the king is perhaps best exemplified in a passage from Tablet I of the Standard Babylonian Gilgameš Epic, which dwells at length on the qualities linked to the prestige of the occupant of the office of rulership; it might well be that this passage originally constituted the introduction to the Old Babylonian epic:1
Gilgameš Epic I 30 ff.
(30) Surpassing all kings, heroic, lordly in stature (šanuʾudu bēl gatti), Heroic offspring (qardu lillid) of Uruk, a charging wild bull (rīmu muttakpu), He leads the way in the vanguard, He marches at the rear, defender of his comrades, Mighty floodwall (kibru dannu), protector of his troops, (35) Furious flood-wave (agû ezzu) smashing walls of stone, Wild calf of Lugalbanda, Gilgamesh is perfect in strength (gitmālu emūqi), Suckling of the divine wild cow, the woman Ninsun, Towering Gilgamesh is uncannily perfect (gitmālu rašubbu). ...
(47) Who could be like his for kingly virtue ([ša itti]šu iššannanu ana šarrūti)? And who, like Gilgamesh, can proclaim, “I am king!” Gilgamesh was singled out from the day of his birth, (50) Two-thirds of him was divine, one third of him was human! The Lady of Birth drew his body’s image (ṣalam pagrīšu), The God of Wisdom brought his figure to perfection (ulteṣbi gattašu).

220 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
In Assyrian royal ideology, physical wholeness and perfection of the body were
considered the basic requirement for rulership, as only the perfect body could
represent a body politic. Accordingly, corporal perfection was essential if the
king was to be entrusted with the shepherdship of the people, a view reflected
in one of Adad-nīrārī II’s (911‒891 BCE) inscriptions:
The great gods, who take firm decisions, who decree destinies, they properly created me, Adad-nīrārī, attentive prince, [...], they altered my stature to lordly stature (nabnīti bēlūti), they rightly made perfect my features (šikin bunnannīya) and filled my lordly body (zumur bēlūtīya) with wisdom. After the great gods had decreed (my destiny, after) they had entrusted to me the scepter for the shepherding of the people, (after) they had raised me above crowned kings (and) placed on my head the royal splendor (melamme šarrūti), they made my almighty name greater then (that of) all lords, the important name Adad-nīrārī, king of Assyria, they called me. Strong king, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters, sun of all people, I:2
It should be noted that in Adad-nīrārī II’s royal inscription, the perfection of
the king’s body is enhanced by the divine grant of splendor (melammu). The
notion of royal melammu was first introduced in Middle Assyrian epic litera
ture, and the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic in particular dwells at length on the scorch
ing effect of the king’s terrifying splendor; this motif likely developed as a
consequence of the king’s emulation of the divine Ninurta figure, as is further
discussed below. Vitality, vigor, and awe-inspiring strength – bordering on out
right aggression – were regarded as prerequisites for successful royal perfor
mance. Masculine vigor and power, qualities necessary for the prosecution of
warfare against rebels and enemies, were conceived of as divine characteristics
that were given to the king already at his birth. In the Mesopotamian weltan
schauung, these masculine qualities were inextricably linked to male potency
and sexuality. Authority and dominance presupposed perfection, which is ex
pressed in the terms banû and damqu, along with life force, vitality (baštu/
baltu), and sexual allure (kuzbu).3 This set of qualities is combined in the de
scription of Gilgamesh to define the king’s body as the body politic, thereby
establishing him as an “effective signifier of heroic virtue”4 (fig. 31).
It was the king’s perfect body that distinguished him from the rest of hu
mankind and associated him with the divine world. The semi-divine hero Gil

gamesh is the primary exemplar of such rulers,5 but this idea is equally conveyed by Tukultī-Ninurta I’s (1233‒1197 BCE) self-praise in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, which constitutes the first stage of a major appropriation of literary traditions from the Sumero-Babylonian south after the reign of Šamšī-Adad I. Although the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic is written in Standard Babylonian, uses the tripartite structure of building inscriptions, relies on tropes such as divine parentage, and associates the two Babylonian chief deities Enlil and Ea with the king, it is distinctly Assyrian in its literary expression and in its ideological message, which focus on the warrior-like qualities of the king and compare him to the ravaging gods Adad and Ninurta:6
(10′) Glorious is his (the king’s) vehemence (šarrahat mamlūssu); it scor[ches the dis]respectful in front and rear. 11′ Glowing is his aggressiveness (qāʾedat irhūssu); it burns the disobedient to the left and right. 12′ His radiances are frightful (melammūšu); they overwhelm all the enemies. 13′ He who (controls) the entire four directions (the whole universe), the awe-inspiring one – the assembly of all kings fear him continually. 14′ When he thunders like Adad, the mountains (=foreign lands) tremble. 15′ And when he raises his weapons like Ninurta, the regions (of the world) everywhere are thrown into constant panic. 16′ By the fate (determined by) Nudimmud, his mass is reckoned with the flesh of the gods (šīr ilāni). 17′ By the decision of the lord of all the lands, he was successfully engendered through/cast into the channel of the womb of the gods. 18′ He alone is the

eternal image of Enlil (ṣalam dEnlil), attentive to the voice of the people, to the counsel of the land. 19′ Because the lord of the world appointed him to lead the troops, he praised him with his very lips, 20′ Enlil raised him like a natural father, after his firstborn son.7
The Assyrian exposition of and reflection upon the king’s perfect body emerged directly from the notion of the social person of the ruler, which included the concept of the homogeneity in action between the gods and the king. Such homogeneity in action is frequently proclaimed in royal inscriptions and elaborated on beautifully in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, where it is based on the very material quality of the king’s status as “the flesh of the gods” (šīr ilāni) and as an “image of [the supreme god] Enlil” (ṣalam dEnlil), as well as in the king’s association with Enlil’s son, the warrior god Ninurta, the divine model to whom the king is compared in this passage of the epic. Interesting in this regard is the fact that in this passage the king’s prowess and global reach are juxtaposed and interwoven with the praise of his unequalled status before the gods.8 As negotiated in myth and in omen compendia, beauty, physical integrity, and virility comprised the visual signifiers of the king’s suitability for the royal office and portended his future success. The perfect body of the king was transformed into a semiotic landscape, read as a favorable sign guaranteeing stability and abundance in the land. It is not surprising, then, that the royal physicians and exorcists of Esarhaddon labored under terrible pressure to hide the physical weaknesses of the king, manifested in a skin rash and other chronic afflictions, from public view.9 Beauty, physical integrity, and virility became the essential tropes of the visual and ritual display of the king’s image, while his individual personality was subsumed within the various official settings of palatial wall reliefs and steles, triumph and state rituals, journeys to his various palaces and residences throughout Assyria, and other occasions of public presentation. All of these media and their various settings functioned to reciprocally augment each other’s message in a variety of ways and through a variety of referencing devices. What remained constant was “the emphasis on the role and figure of the ruler throughout a host of narrative and iconic representations: engaged in ritual practice, facing an enemy citadel or in the lead chariot of a campaign attack.”10 Tukultī-Ninurta I’s characterization of the king as the image of Ninurta was introduced following his conquest of Babylonia and the concomitant appropri

The Typification of Royal Roles 223
ation of Babylonian cultural knowledge. The king as hero – traversing difficult terrain, crossing rivers and even the sea, climbing steep mountains, personally combating the enemy – represented the central innovation and leitmotif in Assyrian ideological discourse during the Middle Assyrian period and came to dominate text, ritual, and image until the collapse of the empire. Although the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic was informed by the tradition of former Babylonian court poetry including royal hymns and epics, its author created a completely new discourse centered on the king’s identification with Ninurta. The importance of the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic to the development of Assyrian royal ideology cannot be stressed enough, as its author, steeped in both Assyrian and Babylonian traditions, established all of the important rhetorical devices and motifs that later featured in the royal inscriptions of Assyrian kings from Tiglath-Pileser I (1114‒1076 BCE) onward. Indeed, some of these tropes and rhetorical devices are known exclusively from the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic and royal inscriptions through to the Sargonid period, when they are revived and elaborated. Beyond the notion of the king embodying the warrior god Ninurta, these motifs include the representation of the enemy leader as violating a treaty previously established with the Assyrian king: this ultimately becomes the standard justification for the Assyrian kings’ military campaigns in their commemorative inscriptions and annals. A further motif introduced in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic is that of soldiers dancing furiously before battle, brandishing their sharpened weapons and taking on strange forms like that of Anzû before proceeding to swirl like a whirlwind in combat (v = A rev. 45′ ff.); this image is later applied to the king himself, who is compared to the sandstorm and flood. At the end of the epic, the king is praised in relation to Nabû – originally a Babylonian divinity associated with knowledge and wisdom – reflecting Tukultī-Ninurta I’s own self-representation as a sagacious, perceptive, and competent ruler, which is discussed in Chapter Seven, and anticipating the central role of Nabû in Assyrian culture during the first millennium BCE.11 There is a marked interdependence in the roles of protagonists, the plotlines, and the shared motifs of myth, epic literature, and royal inscriptions; this interdependence is the focus both of this chapter and of Chapter Seven. The plasticity and malleability of the royal image enabled the hidden agents of royal representation, i.e. the scholars, to fashion the virtual image of the king in such a way as to construct a ‘second reality’ anchored in the coherent framework of Assyrian cosmology; this ‘second reality’ then completely replaced actual reality. The constructed royal image had three primary mani

224 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
festations: the administrative/legal, the political, and the sacral image.12 According to particular contexts or historical circumstances, ideological discourse emphasized specific royal roles and actions, thus maintaining the notion of the cosmic-political order and shaping not only the profile of the individual king, but also social reality. This virtual image of royal perfection did not represent an accomplishment in its own right, but rather served to advance the notion of homogeneity in action between the gods and the king, enabling the king to meet the expectations linked with the various roles of the royal office. In order to fully understand the implications of human and divine kingship and their interdependence in defining rulership per se, we should remind ourselves that the king and the gods were primarily conceived of not as individuals but in terms of their roles and functions; this is similar to the conceptualization of the person in antiquity, who is defined not as an individual but as a social type embedded within a network of social relationships.13 This does not, of course, imply that the identity of the individual was fully effaced by the primacy of group identity and by social typification. Nevertheless, in the societies of the ancient Near East the social role shaped the person more than the person reshaped the social role, and this typification determined the overall idea of the grand narratives of myth, epic, and, ultimately, royal ideological discourse. Because the conception of the gods fell into the same thought structure, the typification of roles also entailed that social actors were conceived of less as unique individuals and more as interchangeable entities, and thus as types that could be either divine or human.14 The king’s actions, consequently, could be shaped according to divine models, or inversely, divine models could be shaped according to the changing conceptions of human rulership. Heavenly kings and human kings shared a particular assemblage of characteristics, roles, and functions, as did the warrior god and the king as warrior, or the divine judge and the king as judge. The role of divinities as models for human beings applies equally to those divinities that represent particular professions listed in the early god lists, which are later commented on in detail in the Old Babylonian Sumerian poem Enki and the World Order and in other myths, reflecting the diversification of

labor in ancient societies. As the status of a divinity rose, so too did the complexity of the roles and functions assembled in a particular type of personage. If the high status of a divinity was complemented by the association of particular emotions and behavioral patterns, the personage could be as complex as the goddess Ištar. Critically, when such types and their assemblage of roles became common knowledge throughout Mesopotamia, they were negotiated in the cultural discourse of local communities in theological as well as in ideological contexts. Regarding the conceptualization of rulership, this line of thought applies especially to the typification of the god Ninurta, who emerged as the model of rulership, be it human or divine, on the basis of the complexity of his roles and his combination of both administrative and martial functions.15
6.2 The “Divinity” of the King
From an ideological perspective, statements asserting that kingship was divine or non-divine in Mesopotamia offer little insight into the institution as it was understood by the ancients.16 In Mesopotamia the office of kingship was con
15 Modern scholars often draw on the indigenous terms of specific cultures – such as apotheosis, consecratio, heros, incarnation, and the likeness to god (imago dei) – to describe particular cultural strategies of assimilating the king with the divine. While all of these categories stand in their own right within their respective cultures, we have to be careful when applying them to the institution of kingship in Mesopotamia or to the larger ancient Near East. Further, if we do use these terms, we have to define and justify this procedure. It was above all Sir James Frazer who shaped the idea of Sacred Kingship in the Golden Bough, which was based on the presumption that, in the “magic period” of mankind, kings possessed magic forces to guarantee the fertility of their people. This force was not supposed to vanish, and at the first sign of weakness the king was to be killed or replaced. Though the king as an individual dies, his powers survive in his successor. Kingship in Egypt and Mesopotamia offered the best proof for Frazer, who reconstructed an annual liturgy of the death and resurrection of the divine king. This liturgy then generated the idea of the magic king, who controls the seasonal cycles, as well as that of gods of death and gods of vegetation. Further universal aspects of kingship put forth by Frazer were sacred marriage and the scapegoating function of the king, all highly controversial topics in the history of religion. 16 With respect to the Old Babylonian period and the first millennium BCE Philip Jones only recently stated: “Kingship was regularly treated as divine in the Old Babylonian corpus and as non-divine in the first millennium one.” This claim seems to rest solely on the writing of the king’s name with the dingir-sign and ignores the complexity of the strategies deployed to sacralize and immunize the institution of kingship throughout the history of Mesopotamia, see Jones 2005, 331. Michalowski 2007, even stated that far too much importance has been attached to the divinization of kings in Mesopotamia. Winter 2007 suggests that sacral and divine kingship should be distinguished from one another.

sidered to be of divine origin and the human king was regarded as its recipient.17 The divinization of kings remained exceptional throughout Mesopotamian history. It is evident for the first time in Early Dynastic Ebla, where the ancestor kings were deified in the mortuary cult and elevated to a status that approached the divine.18 Their invocation in the context of certain state rituals reveals that, owing to their quasi-divine status, royal ancestors were considered guarantors for the continuity of the dynastic line. In later times the names of the kings listed in such invocations were not written with the determinative for a divinity, but the understanding of the divine aspect of the ancestors must have applied to the enthronement ritual of the Old Babylonian king. No ritual prescription survives, but the text known as the Genealogy of the Hammurabi Dynasty was certainly an integral part of the enthronement process.19 The invocation of the members of the dynastic line is probably also evident in the mortuary cult for the royal ancestors in Assyria, as two of the five exemplars of the Assyrian King List survive in the shape of exorcistic tablets, suggesting a performative aspect that likely involved the reading of names.20 Both lists share an introductory section that includes the names of tribes who figured as ancestors within the royal lineage, attesting to the diffusion of the idea of an heros eponymos. This idea persisted in cultic texts from thirteenth century Ugarit, which even share the tribal name of Ditanu – the founding ancestor of the
17 A similar observation has been made for the Egyptian Pharaoh, see Leprohon 1995, 275 and Gundlach 1988; a thorough comparison between the Egyptian and Mesopotamian concepts of kingship is still wanting, as observed by Charpin 2008, 159. 18 ARET 7 150 records ten names in its beginning and proceeds with cultic matters in its second section. That these ten names are royal names is confirmed by the entry en-en in obv. iii 6; in addition, each name is preceded by the Sumerian word dingir for “god.” By comparison with administrative documents, Alfonso Archi has proven that the list “follows a regressive chronological order” and that “the first eight kings must belong to a period that predates the archives, that is, before 2400 BCE” see Archi 1986 and 2001, 2. The regressive order in the ancestor list is due to the oral tradition of genealogical lists and also known from the Assyrian King List and the Ugaritic king list KTU 1.113. For the ancestor cult in Ebla see further Matthiae 1979 and Archi 1988. An ancestor cult is also attested for members of the royal family and high officials at Early Dynastic Lagaš, where the memorial services for the ancestors were held during the festival of Baba (ezem-dBa-ba6), the festival of Lugalurub (ezem-dLugal-urubx) and the festival of Lugalurubar (ezem-dLugal-uru-bar-ka), see Kobayashi 1985. This tradition continued through the period of Gudea at Lagaš, in which the name of the king was written with the dingir-sign in offering texts, see for example ITT 2, 957 (Tsukimoto 1985, 62 f). For the Ur III kings bala documents attest to offerings for the ancestor kings at the ki-a-nag on the eve of new moon and full moon, see Sallaberger 1993, 63 ff. 19 For this text see Finkelstein 1966. 20 Yamada 1994, 37.



The “Divinity” of the King 227
clan ruling the city at the time – with the Mesopotamian tradition. Interestingly, in contrast to their Mesopotamian counterparts the ancestor kings were divinized in Ugarit and their mortuary cult was mythologized.21 The deification of dead kings at Ebla and Ugarit must be distinguished from the deification of King Narām-Sîn of Akkad, who, perhaps due to northern influence,22 decided to write his name with the determinative sign for divinity during his own lifetime following his suppression of the rebellions that marked the beginning of his reign.23 Together with Narām-Sîn’s slightly later adoption of the horned crown in visual imagery, the writing of Narām-Sîn’s name with the qualifier for a divinity served as a new strategy for distinguishing the king from the rest of humankind. Although the Ur III kings conceived of themselves as the protective genii of their city or of the land (dlama Urim-ma and dlama kalam-ma) beginning with the reign of Šulgi,24 this self-designation denoted their protective role toward their subjects rather than an attempt to declare themselves equal in rank with the gods. Deification, which aimed to illuminate a particular function or characteristic of the king or just to revive “central authority in a time of state crisis,”25 was still common in the Old Babylonian period,26 but did not survive beyond it. Instead, ideological efforts were directed toward the development of cultural strategies that sacralized the office of kingship by means of particular tropes that associated the ruler with the divine world. Since the institution of kingship demanded uninterrupted continuity,27 the king was required to perform a range of roles. As is clear from texts, rituals, and visual media, the king was the supreme administrator responsible to his patron deity or to the supreme god of the pantheon; he was the foremost high priest in the cult; he was a hunter and warrior defending not only his controlled territory but also ideally the cosmos against chaos; he was the judge and shepherd of his people; and he was the builder of the temples and the caretaker of the cult. Even though such roles could also be performed by divinities, who then served as models for their human counterparts, in Mesopotamia

the king continued to be regarded as a human being throughout his lifetime.28 Assyrian royal discourse integrated these roles into a logical, interdependent system in which the successful accomplishment of one role reinforced achievements in the other roles and vice versa.
6.3 The Interdependency of Myth and Royal Ideology
6.3.1 Ninurta as Enlil’s Administrator: A Model for Assyrian Kingship
As demonstrated in the preceding chapters, intense cultural interaction facilitated the spread of Babylonian tradition into Aššur and northern Mesopotamia already in the third millennium, continuing through to the Old Babylonian period. This cultural interaction promoted the movement of Babylonian scholars – and with them tropes concerning the image of the king – to the north even prior to Tukultī-Ninurta I’s (1233‒1197 BCE) conquest of Babylonia. Though it is poorly preserved, “the length and complexity of the Adad-nīrārī I Epic suggests that it belonged to a fully developed Assyrian royal epic tradition,”29 which had incorporated and appropriated Babylonian literary models from the legends about the kings of Akkad by the beginning of the thirteenth century BCE. In contrast to the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, the Adad-nīrārī I Epic begins by praising only the Assyrian king, anticipating his exploits and extolling his role as administrator of Enlil; the position of temple administrator is described by the typically Babylonian term šatammu (“chief temple administrator”), rather than by the expected Assyrian term šaknu “governor,” which is attested in the royal inscriptions from Aššur beginning with the reign of ŠamšīAdad I. Like the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, however, the Adad-nīrārī I Epic cites the transgression of a diplomatic agreement that had been concluded between the fathers of the Assyrian king and the Babylonian king as the justification for military action. The passage of the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic that equates the king with Ninurta suggests that during Tukultī-Ninurta I’s reign scholars explicitly formulated a royal ideological discourse that was shaped by the theological concepts that framed the roles embodied by the god Ningirsu/Ninurta. This discourse is extremely complex and rich in Sumero-Babylonian concepts. Accordingly, exploring the various roles and functions of the god Ningirsu/Ninurta is particu

The Interdependency of Myth and Royal Ideology 229
larly illuminating for our understanding of Assyrian royal ideology and the choice of specific royal titles that reference the roles of kingship. Aššur’s assumption of the divine leadership previously ascribed to Enlil, apparent in the notion of the Ellilūtu, was accompanied by his assumption of Enlil’s fatherhood of the warrior god Ninurta, whose functions and roles came to constitute the model for Assyrian kingship. It is, therefore, absolutely essential to understand Ninurta’s relationship with Enlil in the Sumerian-Babylonian tradition in order to grasp the implications of the Assyrian king’s relationship with Aššur-Enlil. Based on his divine genealogy as the son of Enlil and Ninlil, Ningirsu/ Ninurta was assigned the titles “governor of Nippur” (ensi2Nibru ki) and “great governor of Enlil” (ensi2-gal dEn-líl-lá) by the Pre-Sargonic period.30 Ninurta also functioned as the seal-bearer of Enlil, a role that survived into the second millennium in northern Syria, where Ninurta acts as the sealing authority in land transactions in the city of Emar.31 This function symbolizes Ninurta’s legitimate ownership of the land32 and is an outstanding example of the seal representing Ninurta’s role in this particular socio-economic context.33 In the particular case of Emar, Ninurta represented the ownership and authority of the city community and the city-elders rather than that of the king.34 Ninurta’s administrative function persisted into the first millennium, as in Neo-Assyrian cultural practice the gods Aššur and Ninurta were regarded as the owners of the seal that the kings used to authorize their decrees. This concept is expressed at the end of numerous tablets: “ex[cerpted according to the wording of a valid document (dannatu) with the seal of Aššur and Ni]nurta that is [kept] in the Inner City in the temple of [...].”35 As noted by Irene Winter, a text from the reign of Ashurbanipal further illustrates the “extension of the full weight of the royal office and its administrative bureaucracy” by reference to the king’s seal on a tablet recording a royal tax exemption for an official: “do not act negligently against the seal ...” In this line, the seal once again references the authority of the occupant of a particular office, in this case that of the king.36 The function and significance of the seals as representations of

the authority of their owners was exploited fully in the Sargonid period in Esarhaddon’s succession treaty for Ashurbanipal, which is sealed with three versions of Aššur’s seal: the Old Assyrian seal said to be the seal of the City Hall, the Middle Assyrian seal whose inscription is unfortunately too damaged to make any conclusive statement about its content,37 and the Neo-Assyrian seal (fig. 32). This third seal bears an inscription that identifies it as the seal of destinies:
The Seal of Destinies with [which] Aššur, king of the gods, seals the destinies of the Igigi and Anunnaki of heaven and underworld, and of mankind. Whatever he seals he will not alter. Whoever would alter it may Aššur, king of the gods and Mullissu, together with their children, slay him with their terrible weapons! I am Sennacherib, king of [Assyria], the prince who reveres you --- whoever erases my inscribed name or discards this, your Seal of Destinies, erase from the land his name and seed!38
As stated by Andrew George, “the seal’s inscription explicitly reveals the function of the Seal of Destinies to have been the sealing by Aššur of both human and divine destinies, as irrevocably decreed by him in his position as king of the gods.”39 The king’s – or his scholars’ – deliberate decision to apply seals of Aššur from all periods of Assyrian history anchors Aššur’s authority in deep history, advancing the view that the origin of Aššur’s dominion over the world is to be located in primordial times. According to Sumero-Babylonian and Assyrian tradition, however, this dominion could only be enforced through warfare, i.e. the agency of Ningirsu/Ninurta, whose role as warrior god had come to dominate the notion of political and divine leadership.

printed on Esarhaddon’s succession treaty thus point to the transfer of functions and roles from Ninurta to Aššur. Along with the early definitions of Ningirsu/Ninurta’s role as the city administrator of Enlil, there arose a similar rhetoric revolving around the city ruler. Both Lugalzagesi of Uruk and Sargon of Akkad designated themselves as “governor of Enlil” (PA.TEsi-gal-dEn-líl). In subsequent centuries, the title “governor” (ensi2(PA-TE-SI)/iššiʾakku) also came to be used by the city rulers of Lagaš, Old Assyrian Aššur, and Ešnunna, as is discussed in Chapter Three. Among these city rulers, the old Assyrian Erišum I explicitly connects his administrative role as ensi2to his relationship with the god Aššur, who was assigned the title “king”,40 and this connection was never abandoned in Assyrian royal ideology. It was primarily during the second millennium, however, that ancient scholarship began developing coherent narratives regarding the implications of the offices of divine and human kingship. The articulation of such narratives shaped the profile of divinities such as Ninurta – and later Marduk and Aššur as well as that of the king, as is illustrated by the mythic narratives of Angimdimma, Lugal-e, the Anzû Myth, and Enūma Eliš. It is interesting to note that the martial role of Ninurta as heroic warrior prevails in the mythic narratives and that this role subsequently informs official ideological language in Assyria. Such reciprocal rhetoric explains why the image of human and divine leadership was constantly revised in cult and theology – as it was in royal ideology thus allowing them to retain a dynamic quality. The interdependent dynamic that shaped the notion of either royal or divine leadership during the end of the second millennium and during the first millennium BCE is key to unraveling the associations of the office of kingship in Assyria. This dynamic is likewise essential to a proper understanding of the rise of Ninurta and the subsequent assumption of his roles and functions by Marduk, which ultimately contributed to the shaping of the image of Aššur. Finally, it is also key to
comprehending the “emplotment”41 of Assyrian royal inscriptions, i.e. the way a series of events was endowed with the structural coherence of a plot that conformed to the mythic model. This chapter focuses on mythic narrative and its implications for understanding ideology as it is conveyed in the royal inscriptions, while Chapter Nine will discuss the implications of the Aššur-Ninurta-King relationship for Assyrian state rituals.

232 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
6.3.2 Ninurta as Warrior: The Pervasive Rhetoric of the Combat Myth in Image and Text
Ninurta’s role as the divine warrior fighting the lion-eagle Anzû developed alongside his executive roles as ‘sealbearer,’ ‘throne-bearer of Enlil,’42 and ‘governor of Enlil,’ and was referenced in theophoric personal names even before the oldest known written mythic narratives. The cosmogony of the Early Dynastic Barton Cylinder indicates that the cult of the god Ninurta was already established in Nippur by circa 2300 BCE, as was the relationship between Enlil, the chief god of the Sumerian pantheon, and the warrior god. In the cosmogony of the Barton Cylinder, Ninurta is tasked with restoring the gods’ access to food and water. The fragmentary blessing of the winds as Ninurta’s helpers might point to conflict within the larger narrative, particularly because conflict forms a prominent part of the narrative of the later Sumerian tales about Ninurta like Angimdimma and Lugal-e, which are attested in copies from the first half of the second millennium BCE. No text copies narrating the heroic deeds told of Ninurta in Angim and Lugal-e are known from the Early Dynastic Period. There is, however, an early Semitic literary text from Ebla that does associate Anzû with Mount Šár-Šár, which is Anzû’s birth place according to the later Anzû Myth.43 Moreover, Pre-Sargonic theophoric names from the Early Dynastic period exhibit elements that may well refer to a myth concerning the defeat of Anzû by Ningirsu/Ninurta: “Ningirsu has spread his arms for Uruʾinimgina like the Anzû bird (his wings).”44 The cosmogonic significance of the warrior deity is further evident in the Early Dynastic sculpture of a lion-eagle that is thought to have guarded the entrance gate of a temple in Ubaid45 (fig. 33), anticipating in its figural form Anzû’s role as temple guardian. Similarly, the depiction on the Stele of the Vultures of Ningirsu holding a net full of enemies and crowned by the lion-eagle indicates the early importance of an Anzû-like figure and his association with Ningirsu/Ninurta.46 Indeed, even the image of a lion-eagle on the club of the Early Dynastic king Mesalim of Kīš (fig. 34) cannot be imagined

tor of Enlil.47 These myths include the already mentioned Sumerian compositions Angimdimma, in which Ningirsu battles Anzû, and Lugal-e, in which Ninurta campaigns against Asakku and the stones. The Old Babylonian and Standard Babylonian version of the Anzû Myth must also be included among these myths. In Babylonia, elements of the warrior mythology were integrated into the theology that shaped the image of the Babylonian chief god Marduk during the second half of the second millennium. In the Tigridian region, mythological elements of this kind formed part of the narrative regarding the battle of the storm god Tišpak of Ešnunna against the snake dragon at the request of the older god Sîn,48 a mythic tale that is possibly referenced in the iconography of cylinder seals from the Akkadian period (fig. 36).49 It is interesting to note that the adversary of Tišpak was conceived of as a sea dragon; in

surfaces in connection to Baal at Ugarit.53 Jean-Marie Durand stresses54 that the Syrian tradition regarding the smiting of the sea-dragon by the weather god must have informed the narrative of the Babylonian Enūma Eliš, as these particular agents (weather god and sea) were alien to the narrative of Sumerian combat myths. Hurrian domination in northern Syria during the second half of the second millennium BCE facilitated the spread of the imagery of the weather god smiting the snake dragon. This imagery appears in the iconography of a stele of purely southern Anatolian style that was found in the city of Terqa on the middle Euphrates. The stele itself was appropriated by an Assyrian king,55 thus reflecting the recognition of a cultural trope that had the potential to be incorporated into Assyrian ideological discourse (fig. 37). The battle between a weather god and a snake dragon subsequently reappears in the medium of text in a seventh century tablet from Nineveh, which recounts Tišpak’s smiting of the Labbu,56 and then surfaces for the last time in a seal from late Neo-Assyrian Tušhan/modern Ziyaret Tepe (fig. 38).

ive and hostile forces that have unsettled the cosmic balance. In search of a solution, the gods convene and discuss what action should be taken against the disruptive forces. In some cases, they first choose representatives of the older generation of gods to confront the disruptive element. This approach generally fails, and so either a mother goddess is consulted on whom to choose next (Serpent Myth), or an elder god persuades a younger god, sometimes his son, to go into battle (Anzû Myth, Enūma Eliš). The battle is difficult and uncertain, and the younger god sometimes requires assistance in overcoming the challenge of the adversary. To attain victory, the god must not only apply brutal force, but also cultural knowledge, either in the form of an incantation (Enūma Eliš), through the use of the cylinder seal (Labbu Myth), or through the knowledge guarded by the god Enki/Ea and the seven sages. By virtue of his ultimate victory, the young warrior is elevated in the pantheon to a position alongside the existing chief deity. Toward the end of the second millennium and in the first millennium BCE, when Assyria and Babylonia developed into large territorial states and empires, the mythological victory of the younger god established and secured his position as chief god of the pantheon. Consequently, he assumed the mythological role and function of the creator god that had hitherto been occupied by a representative of the older generation. I suggest that all of these stories should be understood as variations on the narrative of the warrior, articulated by various scholarly elites in response to the increasing martial responsibilities of the rulers of the various Mesopotamian urban centers that developed from the fourth through to the third millennium BCE. The rise of regional and supra-regional states prompted the continuous elaboration of these stories, beginning with the battle account itself until it culminates, through combination with other narratives, in a creation myth like Enūma Eliš, which merges in a most sophisticated way the combat and



238 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
creation accounts. The narrative of the combat myth was referenced in all media: texts, i.e. the stories mentioned above, and – as discussed previously – in monumental art and in the iconography of seals, as well as in ritual (investigated in Chapter Ten). As media, however, image and ritual never represent a particular story in full. They are both characterized by their allusive and referential character, only evoking key moments of the narrative and thus presupposing an informed audience already familiar with the relevant cultural knowledge.57 By condensing the central message of mythic narratives, the iconic character of image and ritual was comprehensible even to those who were not part of the Sumerian, Babylonian, or Assyrian “textual communities.” The invocation of broader narratives is apparent, for instance, in the Club of Mesalim, which bears the image of the ferocious Anzû. If the viewer was educated in the stream of tradition, such iconic representations had the potential to trigger the rich repertoire of cultural knowledge that contributed to the determination of the viewer’s own identity. My analysis of the combat myth and its bearing upon the structure and the content of Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions and, as I will discuss at greater length in Chapter Ten, on the performance of major Neo-Assyrian state rituals differs from the structuralist approach originally formulated by Vladimir Propp and others: in addition to emplotment and the particular sequence of action,58 I equally emphasize the types of agents involved. While Propp identifies actions as functions that can be performed by any character, I suggest that a particular set of functions is tied to a particular type of agent, even as the individual embodiments of any one type (Tešub, Ningirsu, Marduk, Aššur, and the king) are interchangeable. The combination of a particular set of functions with a type of agent allows particular actions to become established as tropes59 or icons, which can in turn be mediated equally in myth, royal inscription, and epic, as well as in image and ritual.60 This is not to say that each combat myth developed a particular unique image of the adversaries, for instance, so that in the end these remain recognizable for the audience as distinct characters. Their contours with regard to the plotline, however, were laid out in a way that the king could step into the role of the divine warrior vanquishing an enemy who possessed the monstrous features of a mythic adversary. The third millennium BCE building hymn of Gudea, the king of the powerful city state of Lagaš, constitutes an excellent example of the blending of the
57 See the excellent analysis by Sonik in press (b). 58 Propp 1928 [1958]. 59 For the notion of tropological discourse see White 1973 and 1999. 60 See my further discussions in Chapters Seven and Nine.



The Interdependency of Myth and Royal Ideology 239
king’s role with that of Ningirsu/Ninurta – at least in textual records. Contemporaneous theology endowed the god Ningirsu/Ninurta with legal authority; in Gudea’s dream, Ningirsu presents himself in the following terms: “In the Ebabbar, the place where I issue orders, where I am shining like the sun god, I justly decide, like Ištaran, the lawsuits of my city.”61 The role of Ištaran of Der in overseeing boundary disputes is previously attested in the Early Dynastic royal inscriptions that deal with the border conflict between Umma and Lagaš. The ascription of this function to Ningirsu suggests that Gudea’s theologians/scholars integrated this role into his image as an almighty patron deity of the city state of Lagaš. Accordingly, Gudea’s building hymn illustrates how scholars within a local cult could shape the image of the patron deity, which in turn influenced the image-shaping of the king. Thus, in the praise of the king that appears toward the end of the building hymn the king adopts the role of Ningirsu:
He paid attention to the justice (ordained) by [Nanše] and Ni[ngirsu]; he did not expose the orphan [to the wealthy person] nor did he expose the widow to the [influential] one. ... Day of justice had risen for him, and he set (his) foot on the neck of evil and complaint. Had he not himself risen for his city from the horizon like the sun god?62
It is precisely in this section of the hymn that the ideological discourse merges the king’s establishment of civic order inside the controlled territory ordained by the patron deity Ningirsu with the martial activities performed at the frontiers, which serves to secure the king’s supreme legal authority in both realms. At the time, this explicit blending of the inner and outer order established by royal control represented a new step in the of development royal ideological discourse. Before the advent of royal inscriptions, these roles were depicted separately in iconography. This is apparent in the visual media, notably in the Uruk Vase, which depicts the king as the provider for the temple, the Warka Lion-Hunt Stele, which portrays the king as a hunter protecting his city from the threatening wilderness beyond it, and in the Prisoner Scenes on various sealings that show the king in his role as victorious warrior alongside the naked and utterly defeated enemy. By contrast, no image of the ruler performing justice is known from the Uruk period. It was only during the Lagaš II dynasty, under Urnanše and Gudea in particular, that the king’s roles as ultimate legal

authority and as the warrior who sustains the civic order and the cosmic balance were combined. References to warfare are attested in royal inscriptions already in the Early Dynastic period and persist through to the reign of Urnanše of Lagaš. In their building inscriptions dedicated to the temple of Ningirsu, however, Urnanše and his successor Gudea emphasize their roles in fostering long-distance trade and omit any reference to their military undertakings, thereby establishing a new ideological model for inscriptions and expanding the existing tropes.63 The peaceful image of the ruler promoted by the textual sources64 is mirrored by the image of the ruler in visual media, which never represent Gudea as a victorious warrior.65 This absence of martial imagery has strongly shaped modern perceptions of the Sumero-Babylonian kings. It also stands in stark contrast to the martial tone of the royal inscriptions of the Old Akkadian kings that preceded the Lagaš II Dynasty, as well as to the tone of the Ur III hymns, which overlapped with the reign of Gudea at least for the period of Ur-Namma.66 Later Assyrian tradition also differs in this respect from the model of Urnanše and Gudea, as the pacification of the world through warfare remained an essential trope of Assyrian royal ideology. As such, it is significant to note that when King Gudea maps out the image of the ideal world order just before the gods are supposed to enter the newly built temple, he uses a metaphor for controlling the undomesticated sphere. This mode of royal self-representation can be read as a variant of the king as hunter theme, which links the trope of the pacification of the world with the gods’ consequent occupation of their future residence. In this imagery, wild animals kneel down and lions and other dangerous beasts are made to sleep peacefully side by side:

All the raw materials necessary for the building such as woods, bitumen, gypsum, copper, gold, silver, and carnelian, which are obtainable only through distant trade missions (Edzard, Gudea, E3/1.1.CylA xv 6‒xvi 32) and military campaigns, are not explicitly mentioned. For a discussion of whether the necessary raw materials were obtained by trade (Edzard, Gudea, 26) or as booty (Cooper), see the review by Cooper 1999b, 699. The earlier military activities of King Eannatum against Elam already testify to hostile relations with the East (Bauer 1998, 457), and this conflict continued in later periods.

The goats and asses, the creatures of the steppe, are kneeling together.68 On the lion, panther, and the “dragon of the steppe” he (Gudea) set sweet sleep.69 (Gudea CylB iv 18‒21)
Gudea’s choice of this particular metaphor points to the cosmological underpinnings of royal ideology, which imagined that royal power partakes in the cosmic order by establishing control beyond the city, penetrating the realm of disorder and chaos. These cosmological underpinnings – cast in metaphor by Gudea – continued to dominate ideological discourse for centuries to come.70 At its very end, Gudea’s building hymn harks back to another image of utopia, located exclusively in the human realm:
eme-níg-hul-da inim ba-da-kúr níg-érim é-ba im-ma-an-g[i4]

67 D. O. Edzard translates both verbs gurum/gam-ma-àm and gar-ra-àm as 3rd pl., interpreting the animals as the subject for the participle form ending in -àm. This is not the only example for the 3rd pers. sing. used for plural subject; on the function of /-am/ in metaphorical language, see Black 1998, 16. 68 In contrast to Dietz O. Edzard, I prefer to render the exact meaning of gam =kanāšu, “to prostrate, to kneel down,” because the same verb may be used with the meaning “to subdue” the enemy. Although the verbal chains are clearly formed according to the pattern of the 3rd pers. Singular, this differentiation does not apply in the case of the Stative. In contrast to Edzard, who prefers to translate the verbal forms with a fientic aspect, I prefer to emphasize the static aspect as suggested by the grammatical form with the ending /-am/. 69 Edzard, Gudea, CylB iv 18‒21 70 By referring to the three categories of animals ‒ lion, panther, and “dragon of the steppe” the author conveys the graded distance of the realm of antiorder outside the domestic sphere. He introduces the categories “normal,” “exotic” and “demonic” through the lion of the steppe, the panther which is more likely at home in the mountains, and the “dragon of the steppe” representing the demonic sphere, Pongratz-Leisten 2006, 47 ff. 71 Edzard, Gudea, CylB xviii 2‒3.



242 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
torical device later used by Neo-Assyrian kings to describe the treacherous and rebellious actions of disloyal subjects. In the royal inscriptions of Neo-Assyrian kings, expressions such as “untruthful speech” (dabāb lā kitti), “evil-speaking tongue” (lišān lemuttim), and “to plan evil things” (lemuttu kapādu) are synonymous with “lie” (sarru) or “untruthful speech” (dabāb sarrāti), which were clearly linked to the violation of a treaty or loyalty oath.72 Although they are still situated in distinct sections of the narrative, the two passages from Gudea’s building hymn cited above anticipate the equation of hunting and warfare that dominates Assyrian royal rhetoric and iconography beginning with the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I (1115‒1077 BCE) at the end of the Middle Assyrian period. Peter Machinist and Hayim Tadmor have stressed the heroic tenor of Assyrian royal inscriptions and warn the modern reader about their questionable historicity and their use of literary topoi.73 Hayim Tadmor in particular has highlighted the literary and historiographical convention within Assyrian commemorative inscriptions to describe a victory that was achieved at the very outset of the king’s reign. This convention served to convey the image of the successful warrior “in conformity with the norms of behavior befitting an Assyrian monarch.”74 As is discussed in Chapter Nine, I believe that the earliest attestation of this convention within Tigridian ideological discourse is to be found in Daduša’s liver model.75 Regarding the Assyrian royal inscriptions themselves, the first example of a literary presentation of history of this kind can be attributed to Shalmaneser I (1267‒1234 BCE). Subsequent to his titulary, Shalmaneser I begins his military account with a temporal clause introduced by enūma (“when”), referring to a rebellion in Urartu that was suppressed in just three days:
When (enūma) Aššur, the lord, faithfully chose me to worship him, gave me scepter, weapon, and staff to (rule) properly the blackheaded people, and granted me the true crown of lordship: at that time (ina ūmēšuma), at the beginning of my priesthood (ina šurru šangûtīya), the land Uruaṭri rebelled against me. I prayed to the god Aššur and the great gods, my lord. I mustered my troops (and) marched up to the mass of their mighty mountains. I conquered .... I destroyed, burnt, (and) carried off their people and property. I subdued all the land Uruaṭri in three days at the feet of Aššur, my lord.76

The Interdependency of Myth and Royal Ideology 243
As observed by Tadmor, Shalmaneser I’s son Tukultī-Ninurta I makes use of the same technique. Tukultī-Ninurta I links his campaign against Babylonia to his conquest of the western regions, combining the two through the vague term “then” (ina ūmēšuma). This connection is made in order “to convey the message that all the military feats of the king, culminating in the conquest of Babylon, the apex of his achievements, actually took place within the first palû, or during a period of time very close to the first palû. Obviously, this is not a chronological arrangement of events.”77 This kind of literary patterning is, of course, diametrically opposed to chronistic narration, and for several generations Assyrian kings vacillated between the two. Chronistic narrative and heroic epic narrative were successfully combined for the first time only in the form of Tiglath-pileser I’s annals.78 As Tadmor notes, Tiglath-pileser I’s prism-inscription from Aššur, covering his first five regnal years (palû), “kept to the literary convention of introducing the feats of the first regnal year by the short formula ina šurru šangûtīya. The account of each subsequent year was separated from the preceding account by a short paean of praise set between two horizontal lines. Though these accounts were not marked as palû’s, in the concluding section of the historical narration a specific reference was made that all these victories were achieved from ‘the beginning of my reign, from my accession year to my fifth palû.’”79 The king’s scholars, who wrote the accounts of great victories that were sometimes said to have been achieved in one day, were clearly inspired by the epic traditions regarding the legendary kings of Akkad, which make use of similar motifs. Though written in prose, the text of Tiglath-pileser I’s prism-inscription from Aššur “is heavily loaded with poetic similes, hyperbolae, typological numbers, and repetitions characteristic of epic style. A unique feature of this text is that each campaign is set off by a poetic device, a rhythmic stanza of praise, and not, as in later annalistic texts by a date expressed in terms of the respective eponym, or the regnal year.”80 In the course of the subsequent development of Assyrian historiographic writing, the chronistic approach became firmly entrenched and annalistic writing established itself, undergoing only modest modification. The chronistic template was not interrupted until the Sargonid period, when room was made for the inclusion of ideological statements, prayers, dream reports, and visions, leading to the progressive blurring of the distinction between heroic poems and historiographic literature. The following discussion neither focuses on the

close relationship between these two genres nor reiterates the excellent analyses of Tadmor, Liverani, and Cifola regarding royal titularies, which reveal the ideological structure that underlies the royal inscriptions.81 Instead, I investigate the mythological underpinnings of royal inscriptions in order to reveal their emplotment.
6.4 The King as Hunter: The Middle Assyrian Contribution to Ideological Discourse
During the period of the Club of the Great Powers, the trope of the hunt as a metaphor for the king’s obligation to defeat and control the disruptive elements encroaching upon the civilized order of the state emerged as a central motif in royal ideological discourse. The image of the hero smiting the lion and other wild animals dominates the iconography of the royal seal of Sauštatar towards the end of the fifteenth century BCE. Under the Hittite kings Hattušili III and Tudhaliya IV (c. 1227‒1209 BCE), the hunt became part of a ritual event performed in honor of the stag god, tutelary god of the king.82 The combination of hunt and cultic was also integrated into Hittite monumental art, appearing in “the upper register of the Sphinx Gate’s western tower at Alaça Höyük.”83 Such scenes remain an essential theme in later Syro-Anatolian monumental iconography, as is demonstrated by the Neo-Hittite evidence at Carchemish, and were also incorporated into Assyrian palatial imagery. Nearly concomitantly with the Hittite ideological discourse during the later imperial period the trope of the hunt emerges equally in Assyria. The stag god, of course, does not feature in Assyrian culture. Nevertheless, the stag itself does figure in Middle Assyrian glyptic imagery. While the stag is attested also in the early imagery of Southern Mesopotamia,84 its concurrency in Hittite and Middle Assyrian imagery is striking and attests to the interactive dynamics between the two powers. Middle Assyrian glyptic iconography abounds in leaping stags and scenes portraying the hero attacking lion-griffins, ibexes, the wild bull, or the moufflon. One Middle Assyrian seal is particularly telling in its combination of combat, represented by a lion-griffin attacking a wild bull, with reverence for the gods, represented through the depiction of a kneeling

worshipper under an altar crowned by the solar winged disk (Fig. 39).85 This combination explicitly signals the cosmic implications of the hunt as part of the king’s obligations towards the gods, which are referenced in the depiction of the cultic scene. As such, the seal evokes the iconography of Sauštatar’s royal seal and bespeaks the intense interaction between Mitanni, Hatti, and Assyria in the creation of their respective discourses on royal ideology and to match each other’s claims. A letter from the Hittite king Hattušili III to his Babylonian counterpart Kadašman-Enlil II suggests that the hunt was considered an essential signifier for maturing into manhood within Hittite royal ideology: “I have heard that my brother has turned into a man and goes hunting” (KBo 1, 10 rev. 49).86 Already during the Ur III period Šulgi extols his own protection of his subjects and their herds from the threat of the lion – the apex predator – and the wild bull, animals that endangered the life and livelihood of pastoralists. By hunting wild animals with his bow and stabbing lions with his spear, Šulgi exposed himself to risk and danger in order to ensure the wellbeing of his subjects. Despite the importance of the hunt in Šulgi’s self-praise, it appears that the hunt was only ritualized in the Syro-Anatolian milieu and that its cosmic di

mensions and implications for kingship were then fully articulated in Assyria, prompting the rise of this trope in Assyrian royal ideological discourse toward the end of the Middle Assyrian period. In the royal inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser I, the trope of the hunt as an icon of civilization was regarded as a direct parallel to warfare: the hunt constituted a perpetual struggle against chaos. Later Neo-Hittite iconography in the reliefs of the King’s Gate at Carchemish (figs. 40 and 41) equates the hunt with warfare,87 representing a further product of the intercultural dynamics between Assyria and the Syro-Anatolian horizon. When the notion of the hunt itself entered Assyrian ideological discourse, it was reformulated and reconceptualized within the framework of the king’s mythologization as Ninurta.

In the Middle Assyrian period it is possible to discern the reemergence of Assyrian textual production after the centuries of disintegration and Mitannian overlordship that followed the reign of Šamšī-Adad I (1808‒1776 BCE). Renascent Assyrian textual production is manifest during the reign of Adad-nīrārī I (1295‒1264 BCE) in the form of the first Assyrian heroic poem, the Adad-nīrārī I Epic.88 Middle Assyrian textual production experienced a climax under Tukultī-Ninurta I, who oversaw the composition of the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic following his sack of Babylon, as well as the composition of several other bilingual literary works, including his historical prayers to Aššur.89 Under Tiglath-Pileser I, lively scribal activity continued and “traditional literary works were copied and original compositions were produced, both being collected in a royal library.”90 The colophons of these texts reveal the involvement of a body of professionals
88 The text is preserved in several fragments: KAR 260 and KAH 2, 143. Another fragment (Rm 293), a duplicate, is published in AfO 17, 1954‒56, p. 369. Two further duplicates have been published by Weidner, AfO 20, 19 63, 113‒115. 89 See Chapter 3.5.3.1. 90 Hurowitz and Westenholz 1990, 1. Whether the scholars produced these texts for the royal library of Tiglath-Pileser I, as originally suggested by Weidner 1952–53, or for their own reference libraries, as discussed by Lambert 1976, 85 n. 2, remains unclear and is not relevant to the present discussion.



248 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
with the titles ‘diviner’ (bārû), ‘chief diviner’ (rab bārê), ‘diviner of the king’ (bārî šarri), ‘scribe’ (ṭupšarru), and ‘exorcist’ (mašmaššu),91 which is essentially the same group of experts that is attested in the first millennium correspondence of the late Sargonid kings. Several texts are said to be copies of originals from Nippur, Babylon, Akkad, and Aššur, demonstrating again the embeddedness of these scholars in a broader cultural network of textual productivity. The Middle Assyrian catalogue of songs (Liederkatalog KAR 158) contains twelve Akkadian royal hymns (zamar šarri), five heroic songs (qurdu), and two gangiṭṭu-songs with the titles “trampler of the corners (of the world), who throws all the cities into confusion,”92 and “let me sing of the strong god, the royal one, the heroic god”93 (KAR 158 rev. iii 13‒14).94 These songs were part of the intense literary production of the Middle Assyrian period and attest to the recurrent ceremonial celebration of the king.95 The indebtedness of Middle Assyrian textual production to Babylonian tradition is indicated by the presence of Middle Babylonian texts that were either brought to Aššur or written in Aššur among those found in Assyria. Assyrian indebtedness to Babylonia is further evident in the fact that the Assyrian chronicles, epic literature, and royal inscriptions of the Middle Assyrian period are all written in the Standard Babylonian literary dialect and make use of its narrative language, motifs, and topoi regarding the experience of the king and his accomplishments. Indeed, Tukultī-Ninurta I’s reference to his pillaging of Babylonian libraries and the presence of Babylonian scholars at Aššur both demonstrate explicitly the process of Assyrian borrowing from Babylonia. Although Assyrian textual production drew on Babylonian tradition, Middle Assyrian texts nevertheless display a typically Assyrian view of the institution of kingship, which is particularly evident in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic.
Text corpora like the Middle Assyrian Laws and the Harem Edicts incorporate material from the reign of Aššur-uballiṭ I (1353‒1318 BCE), making clear that Middle Assyrian scribal activity can be traced to the very beginning of Assyria’s development into a territorial state and to the very moment of its arrival on the international scene. In this light, Middle Assyrian cultural production can be seen as a reflection of the aspirations of Assyria’s kings to join the Club of the Great Powers and to be accepted as equals by their royal peers not just as politically and militarily, but also culturally. The extent of Assyria’s

The King as Hunter: The Middle Assyrian Contribution to Ideological Discourse 249
cultural ambition is apparent in the fact that Middle Assyrian Aššur has so far yielded the most comprehensive corpus of lexical texts, including thematic lists, acrographic lists, and lists like Nabnītu, Erimhuš, the Emesal Vocabulary, and Grammatical Lists.96 Middle Assyrian royal inscriptions were frequently written with archaizing Babylonian sign forms, and scribes often stressed the Babylonian origin of their texts. Niek Veldhuis observes that lexical texts like the explanatory list Ea use archaizing Babylonian sign forms to designate entries in the list but Assyrian sign forms for the accompanying explanatory text. This writing style is thus part of the effort to emulate Babylonian cultural practice in order to bolster the Assyrian claim to cultural prestige.97 Most of these various text genres center on the figure of the king and are dominated by a heroic world view. As the preferred object of the literarizing process, the king was represented as the pivot between political, situationbound reality, and literary, mythic, and situation-abstract fiction. The Middle Assyrian heroic poems revive the tradition of the Ur III royal hymns98 and are literarily interdependent with the royal inscriptions. This literary interdependence is evident not only in the fact that both the Middle Assyrian heroic poems and the royal inscriptions are written in the Standard Babylonian dialect, but also in their use of rare and unusual words, which is first attested in the heroic poems and subsequently appears in the royal inscriptions.99 Moreover, the royal narratives concerning the military accomplishments of particular kings were refashioned in the Middle Assyrian period into an annalistic form that presented campaigns individually and in chronological order, where previously such commemorative inscriptions had been organized geographically.100 It is also from this period that there is evidence for the rewriting of annals at certain intervals. The earliest edition of Tiglath-Pileser I’s annals, composed after the fifth year of his reign, marks a watershed in the development of historiographic writing because the text is pervaded by literary features known from the legends of the Kings of Akkad.101 In Tiglath-Pileser I’s annals, for example, victories are said to have been achieved within a short time span (see the Great Revolt Against Narām-Sîn for comparison), while the king himself is depicted

250 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
in nearly divine terms like in the Tukultī-Ninurta I Epic and the text is dominated by a heroic-epic tenor.102 Myth functions as the referential system determining the narrative structure of Tiglath-Pileser I’s (1115‒1077 BCE) royal inscriptions. In these royal inscriptions, the hunt – framed in mythic icons evoking the life-threatening moment of direct encounter with the monstrous – appears in narrative form, which is paralleled by the military account. As a re-actualization of the master narrative of the combat myth, the hunt is historicized, concretizing the category of beast that the king encounters, as well as the moment in time and the geographic space in which he does so. Although it triggers the cultural memory of the primordial battle against disruptive forces, the hunt simultaneously continues to figure as an icon that identifies the cosmic implications of the king’s battle against his enemies, which is described in the parallel account of the king’s military campaigns. The intimate relationship between the hunt and the military account in the royal inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser I underlines the fluid nature of the boundaries between myth and “historical” narrative. Further, Tiglath-Pileser I’s annals make the juxtaposition of war and the hunt explicit by combining the extensive report of the king’s military campaigns over the course of several years with a narrative about the king’s qualities as a hunter. Although the king’s hunting expeditions were probably staged at various occasions during his campaigns, Tiglath-Pileser I’s annals present them in one coherent section. The annals organize military events according to the regnal year in which they took place, but the narrative of the various hunting expeditions is arranged according to geographical location. This arrangement anticipates the system by which Ashurbanipal structures the military accounts in his royal inscriptions several centuries later. The animals killed by the king represent the various regions of the realm of chaos, which are brought under the control of the god Aššur through the efforts of the king. Chief among these animals are the wild bull of the steppe and the lions of the mountains:
vi 55‒57) Tiglath-Pileser, valiant man, armed with the unrivalled bow, expert in the hunt.
vi 58‒69) The gods Ninurta and Nergal gave me their fierce weapons and their exalted bow for my lordly arms. By the command of the god Ninurta, who loves me, with my strong bow, iron arrow-heads, and sharp arrows, I slew four extraordinary strong wild virile bulls in the desert, in the land Mittani, and at the city Araziqu which is before the land Hatti. I brought their hides and horns to my city Aššur.
102 Hurowitz and Westenholz 1990, 1.



The King as Hunter: The Middle Assyrian Contribution to Ideological Discourse 251
vi 70‒75) I killed the strong bull elephants in the land Harran and the region of the River Hābūr (and) four live elephants I captured. I brought the hides and tusks (of the dead elephants) with the live elephants to my city Aššur.
Vi 76‒84) By the command of the god Ninurta, who loves me, I killed on foot 120 lions with my wildly outstanding assault. In addition, 800 lions I felled from my light chariot. I have brought down every kind of wild beast and winged bird of the heavens whenever I have shot an arrow.103
The expansion of his control into Lebanon and toward the Mediterranean coastline prompted Tiglath-Pileser I to include the bull elephant of the region of Harran and the Hābūr River among the animals he hunted. When TiglathPileser I reached the sea, he made a point of hunting the ‘horse of the sea’ (nāhiru):
16‒25 I marched to Mount Lebanon. I cut down (and) carried off cedar beams for the temple of the gods Anu and Adad, the great gods, my lords. I continued to the land Amurru (and) conquered the entire land Amurru. I received tribute from the lands Byblos, Sidon, (and) Arvad. I rode in boats of the people of Arvad (and) travelled successfully a distance of three double hours from the city of Arvad, an island, to the city Ṣamuru which is in the land Amurru. I killed at sea a nāhiru, which is called a sea-horse.104
Securing access to the Mediterranean Sea represented a major military triumph for Tiglath-Pileser I, adding a novel dimension to the territories under Assyrian control. Tiglath-Pileser I’s inscription celebrates this achievement through its inclusion of the ceremonial hunt of the sea-horse, which reflects the cosmic overtones of world dominion. The cosmic implications of Tiglath-Pileser I’s conquest of the sea and the mountains are also conveyed visually by the manufacture of replicas of the sea-horses and their stationing at the gates of the royal palace as ‘symbols of the subjugated wilderness.’105 Following the military reports and the hunting accounts, Tiglath-Pileser I adds a lengthy selfpraise that portrays him as the benefactor of his land and his people, another innovation that combines war and the hunt as prerequisites for the exercise of royal power. The overall effect of Tiglath-Pileser I’s inscription is to argue powerfully that the king met all the expectations and obligations incumbent on the occupant of the royal office. War and the hunt are also bound together by the common terminology used to describe them: “(Tiglath-Pileser), whose weapons the god Aššur has

sharpened,”106 “I strike the wicked like the fierce dagger,”107 and “I overpower like the net, I enclose like the trap.”108 The parallel treatment of war and the hunt in the annals of Tiglath-Pileser I and in those of later Neo-Assyrian kings regarding form, structure, and language reveals their common meaning and function, so that the killing of the lion and other wild animals signified nothing less than the defeat of Assyria’s enemies and the attendant expansion of Aššur’s control over the world.109 These tropes are interspersed with historical and geographical details, but their literary composition and the omission of any mention of royal defeat indicate that the annals were part of an idealbiographical royal discourse. The Hunter, a “short, epic-style poem about a campaign of an Assyrian king against mountain peoples, cast in a metaphor of a hunter stalking wild game,”110 belongs to the context of the reshaping of royal inscriptions and the creation of historicizing poetry. The text was found in the Aššur temple as part of an excerpt tablet or school exercise that also contained the beginning of Ištar’s Descent. It was originally assigned to Tiglath-Pileser I by its editor Erich Ebeling,111 who identified a direct intertextual relationship between The Hunter and Tiglath-Pileser I’s military report of his conquest of Murattaš. This attribution has not been widely accepted, and scholars like Borger have, by contrast, classified The Hunter as a Neo-Assyrian text written in archaizing style.112 Only Victor Hurowitz and Joan Goodnick Westenholz,113 followed by Benjamin Foster,114 have argued that The Hunter should be dated to Tiglath-Pileser I as Ebeling suggested. Indeed, until recently Dietz Otto Edzard, based on Stefan Maul’s observations regarding the paleography of the text, classified The Hunter as a Neo-Assyrian parody of a military report.115 With all due respect to these scholars, the dating proposed by Ebeling seems to me best suited to the paleography and orthography of the text, a view reinforced by The Hunter’s parallels with the poem LKA 63.116 It also makes more sense to me to classify the text as a fable than as a parody.

The King as Hunter: The Middle Assyrian Contribution to Ideological Discourse 253
In light of The Hunter’s glorifying character and its praise of the god Aššur, the text should be located in the larger framework of Assyrian historicizing poetry and heroic poems (qurdu). The Hunter is nevertheless unique because of its allegorical or parabolic character, which has no clear parallel in Mesopotamian literature. The hero of the narrative remains anonymous throughout, and is only referred to with the epitheton ornans as the ‘hunter’ (bajjāru). As in the royal inscriptions, the introductory section of The Hunter praises the king as a victorious warrior whose military endeavors enjoy the support of the gods. In the text, the king plans a military campaign, but his adversaries are depicted as mountain donkeys rather than human beings. As noted by Ebeling, this curious feature turns the poem into an allegorical fable.117 Persuaded that they are protected by the inaccessible wilderness of the mountains, a motif reminiscent of the Sargon tale King of Battle,118 the mountain donkeys feel strong enough to defend themselves. In line with other legendary literature, the hunter consults the gods by means of extispicy regarding the right moment for his attack and subsequently sets out on campaign with his soldiers and chariots. Following a one day march covering a distance that would normally take three days to traverse, the hunter reaches the enemy land and puts it to the torch before sunrise. The inhabitants of the mountain region – now human in nature – are all killed, and not even pregnant women and children are spared. The poem concludes with praise for the god Aššur:
LKA 62
1 [Who curbs] foes, trampler of his enemies, 2 [Who hunts] mountain donkeys, who startles the creatures of the steppe, 3 [The Hunter]: Aššur is his ally, Adad is his help, 4 Ninurta, vanguard of the gods, [go]es before him. 5 The Hunter plans battle against the donkeys, 6 He sharpens(?) his dagger to cut short their lives. 7 The donkeys hear that (but continue) to gambol around, 8 The Hunter’s terror had not yet come down upon them. 9 They counter the (potential) confusion (of battle with the question): “Whoever came near us? 10 Who is it, not having seen who we are, who tries to frighten our assembly? 11 We are to be neglected (=protected by) the closed circle of the high mountains, 12 Because our dwelling place lies within the enclosure of the mountains. 13 May the wind blow the Hunter’s snare away, 14 May the shootings of his bow not come to reach us who are assembled (in the mountains).”
117 Ebeling 1949, 33. 118 Westenholz 1997, 102‒139.



254 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
15 The Hunter heard the chatter of the mountain beasts, (and thought) 16 “They are deprived of their reasoning, their words are troubled, 17 Their tendon is like chaff, the men are like a newborn.” 18 To the warriors who will open (new paths) on the mountain peaks, he says: 19 “let us go and bring massacre upon the mountain beasts, 20 With our sharpened weapon let us shed their blood.” 21 He performed an extispicy for his appointed time, 22 He raged like Adad (and like) Šamaš he was hitching up his chariotry.
23 A journey of three days he marched [in one]. 24 Even without sunshine a fiery heat was among them, 25 He slashed the wombs of the pregnant, blinded the babies, 26 He cut the throats of the strong ones among them, 27 The smoke of their land barred their land. 28 Whatever land is disloyal to Aššur will turn into wasteland. 29 Let me sing of the mighty victory of Aššur, who goes out into combat, 30 and repeatedly achieves victory over the troops of the entire world. 31 Let the first one hear and te[ll it] to the later ones!119
Like Tiglath-Pileser I’s annals and consistent with northern Mesopotamian tradition, The Hunter limits the concept of the homogeneity and congruence of human-divine action to the god Aššur and the Storm God Adad; Ninurta is included only as the model for the king. In the annals, however, divine agency in the hunting reports centers on Aššur and Ninurta. Two examples from the annals suffice to illustrate this point:
In addition I got control of (and) formed herds of (vii 5) naiālu deer, aiālu-deer, gazelles, (and) ibex which the gods Aššur and Ninurta, the gods who love me, had given me in the course of the hunt in high mountain ranges. I (vii 11) numbered them like flocks of sheep, I sacrificed yearly to the god Aššur, my lord, the young born to them as voluntary offerings together with my pure sacrifices.120
Tiglath-Pileser, exalted prince, the one whom the gods Aššur and Ninurta have continually guided wherever he wished (to go) and who pursued each and every one of the enemies of the god Aššur and laid low all the rebellious.121
Beginning with Tiglath-Pileser I, Assyrian royal inscriptions acquire their typical structure, in which the king’s titulary and genealogy is followed by military accounts (and often a hunting account), a building account, and a blessing and curse section focusing on the protection of the king’s name and of the inscription itself.

The King as Hunter: The Middle Assyrian Contribution to Ideological Discourse 255
The White Obelisk (fig. 42), found in 1853 by Hormuzd Rassam “between the outer court of Sennacherib’s palace at Nineveh and the Ishtar Temple,”122 is a key piece of evidence linking the royal inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser I and their imagery of war and hunt to the historical narrative of the Neo-Assyrian period as represented in the ninth century reliefs of Aššurnaṣirpal II. There has been some scholarly controversy regarding the dating of the obelisk,123 but recently Holly Pittman, building on the work of Julian Reade, has advanced convincing arguments for attributing the obelisk to the reign of Aššurnaṣirpal I (1049‒1031 BCE).124 Except for two hymns dedicated to the goddess Ištar, very little is known of Aššurnaṣirpal I; it is therefore all the more crucial to include the White Obelisk in any discussion of the development of Assyrian ideological discourse during the transition from the Middle Assyrian to the Neo-Assyrian period. The obelisk is decorated with eight registers on all four sides, representing scenes of warfare, hunting, tribute processions, and ceremonial and ritual performances. Of interest to our discussion of the parallelism of warfare and hunt is the fact that the scenes dedicated to these subjects appear in the uppermost and lowermost registers of the obelisk, effectively framing the tribute scenes and the ritual scenes. This arrangement suggests the same understanding of the function of war and hunt in establishing cosmic order that is evident in texts from the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I. Additionally, the fragmentary hymn celebrating Aššurnaṣirpal I as a hunter supports the dating of the White Obelisk to his reign.125 Another intriguing aspect of this monument is that its epigraph mentions the bīt nathi, which, if related to the Hittite nathi – originally a Hurrian loanword denoting a ceremonial bed126 – perfectly fits the content of the Assyrian ritual for Ištar as known from its Sargonid period versions.127 The White Obelisk can be considered the precursor of the ceremonial representations of war and hunt that appear in the celebrated reliefs of Aššurnaṣirpal II’s throne room in his North-West Palace at Nimrud, in the bronze bands of the Balawat Gates of Shalmaneser III, and in the reliefs of Ashurbanipal’s North and South-West Palaces at Nineveh. Natalie May interprets these images as depictions of the Assyrian War Ritual known from the ritual text published by Karlheinz Deller,128 implying an analogy between text and image. I prefer

sentation of historical events (see my discussion in Chapters 9.6 and Chapter 10.4). Beginning with the reign of Shalmaneser III (858‒824 BCE), the image of the king stabbing the lion became the iconic representation of Assyrian kingship as represented on the royal stamp seal (fig. 43),129 and this image was replicated in Ashurbanipal’s hunting scenes (fig. 44).
6.5 The Interface between Myth and Royal Inscriptions
The cosmic dimensions of the king’s military campaigns and their persistence in Assyrian ideological discourse have been discussed at great length in Assyriological literature.130 My intention here is to reveal the mythologizing tendency of the royal inscriptions, which is not only crucial for understanding ancient historicizing literature but also provides a deeper insight into the Assyrian state rituals that reactualized Ninurta’s role annually, as is discussed later in this book. Several Old Babylonian period sites have yielded versions of the Sumerian poems Lugal-e, which describes Ningirsu’s victory over the Asakku-monster and his army of stone allies, and Angimdimma, the story of Ninurta’s return to Ekur (the temple of his father) after his victorious battle against the lion-eagle Anzû. An Old Babylonian version of the Anzû Myth was also in circulation, the first millennium version of which encompasses three tablets and narrates Ninurta’s heroic killing of the lion-eagle Anzû. The Old Babylonian version of the Anzû Myth anthropomorphizes one of Ninurta’s weapons, depicting it as a messenger moving between Ninurta in the battlefield and the god Ea, who helps Ninurta succeed with the help of his magic. The mythology of the god Ningirsu/Ninurta and its adaptation in historiography reflects a conception of warfare that regards this activity as a perpetual act of creation.131 Indeed, the motif of the Chaoskampf is the authoritative “genotext”132 that generates the various mythic “hypotexts” that inform Assyrian royal inscriptions; where they describe military activities, Assyrian royal inscriptions are to be regarded as “hypertexts”133 ultimately derived from the Chaoskampf motif itself. In this capacity, the Chaoskampf motif functions as

The Interface between Myth and Royal Inscriptions 259
“the ultimate sanction of all royal activity.”134 In contrast to the royal inscriptions, from the second millennium BCE onward Ninurta mythology focuses on Ninurta’s martial role to the detriment of his administrative and agricultural functions. In the Anzû Myth, Ea encourages Ninurta at the moment of crisis. Ea’s speech stresses the status and rank of the leader figure, in this case the divine Enlil, as well as the importance of the proper operation of the cult centers spread throughout the four regions of the world. Hierarchical leadership and cult centers are represented as icons of control over the universe, highlighting the central role that the conquest of chaos played in the cosmic scheme:
‘Kill him, conquer Anzû! ‘Let the winds bear off his wing feathers as glad tidings ‘To the temple Ekur, to your father Enlil. ‘Flood and bring mayhem to the mountain meadows, ‘Kill wicked Anzû! ‘Let authority return [to the father] who begot you. ‘Let there be daises to be built, ‘Establish your holy places in the four world regions, ‘[Let] your holy places come into Ekur. ‘Show yourself mighty be[fore the gods], For your name shall be ‘Mighty One.’135
With its motifs of conquest, the (re-)establishment of the cosmic order by reanchoring authority with the god Enlil, the building of temples, and the invocation of the name of the mighty warrior god, this passage anticipates the emplotment of the mythic narrative itself – qualifying it as a “hypotext” or “phenotext” of the original “genotext” of the combat myth136 – and this emplotment is evident in Assyrian royal inscriptions from Tiglath-pileser I onward. Moreover, the passage expresses concisely the axiom of Tukultī-Ninurta I, as stated in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic: “Peace cannot be made without conflict.”137 This principle governs all combat myths and informs first Assyrian heroic epic literature and then Assyrian royal inscriptions.

Malinowski’s concept of the “charter myth” also belongs here Malinowski 1926, as does Genette’s distinction between “hypotext” and “hypertexts”, Genette 1997.

260 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
It is not surprising that Middle and Neo-Assyrian copies of the Anzû Myth have been recovered from multiple sites in the Assyrian empire. Bilingual (Sumero-Akkadian) copies of the Sumerian literary compositions Angim and Lugal-e appear in Assyria during the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I; these texts were again recopied much later in Nineveh during the Sargonid period.138 This evidence highlights the interdependence between myth and royal inscriptions, which accounts for the king’s assumption of a cosmogonic role in his emulation of Ninurta. The claim to universal control in the Anzû Myth passage quoted above perfectly encapsulates Neo-Assyrian royal ideology: any royal battle was understood as a re-actualization of Ninurta’s battle against Asakku or Anzû or of Marduk’s battle against Tiamat.139 The enemies of the Assyrian king assumed the role of the threatening forces confronted by Ninurta in his divine battle.140 As such, the historicity of the enemy was ultimately of little relevance to the ancient historian. The king’s appropriation of Ninurta’s weapons was an important part of the re-actualization of Ninurta’s role. Among these weapons are the flood (Sumerian: a.ma.uru5; Akkadian abūbu), the net (Sumerian: šuškal; Akkadian: šuškallu), and the sandstorm (ašamšatu), all of which are attested as weapons of Tukultī-Ninurta I. From Tukultī-Ninurta I onward, “deluge of the battle” (abūb tamhari) and “like the flood” (abūbiš) became standard epithets of the Assyrian king. Ninurta’s warrior aspect was also important to the shaping of notions of divine kingship more broadly, as is indicated by the fact that Ninurta’s weapons šár-ur4 and šár-gaz, his personified helpers in Sumerian tradition,141 were adopted by Marduk in the first millennium creation epic Enūma Eliš.142 The association of such rhetoric with the supreme god Marduk in turn influenced the mythologizing language of Esarhaddon’s report on his military campaign against Egypt, where he claims that both of these weapons preceded him into the enemy land.143 As a notion, then, ideal rulership was continuously negotiated between myth and royal inscriptions.
138 Cooper 1971, 7. Note that the bilinguals from Ashurbanipal’s library at Nineveh are closer to the Old Babylonian tradition in terms of spelling and variants than to the Middle Assyrian texts, a phenomenon that Rubio tentatively links with Ashurbanipal’s conquest of Nippur, where the Middle Babylonian tradition preserved Old Babylonian writing practice, see Rubio 2009, 44 f. 139 Maul 1999, 210. 140 Maul 1999, 211. 141 Annus 2001; Edzard, Gudea StatB v 37‒44, and vi 21‒44; see also Suter 2000, 189 and 284 ff. 142 Maul 1999, 210‒211. For further examples see Annus, 2002, 99. 143 Borger 1967, 65, Nin. E. col. ii 6‒13.



The Interface between Myth and Royal Inscriptions 261
Ninurta and the king performed similar functions in their defense of the political and cosmic order,144 as is further apparent in the divine epithets originally associated with the warrior god and ultimately applied to the king. Aššurnaṣirpal II’s inscription for the Ninurta temple in Nimrud, which begins with a hymn to Ninurta and subsequently praises the king himself, is a prime example of this development. The hymn to Ninurta reveals that none of the tropes previously developed in Mesopotamian tradition escaped the cultural memory of the king’s scholars, who combined all of these motifs into a persuasive divine image that provided the model for the perfect king:
I 1‒9a) To the god Ninurta, the strong, the almighty, the exalted, foremost among the gods, the splendid (and) perfect warrior whose attack in battle is unequalled, the eldest son who commands battle (skills), offspring of the god Nudimmud, warrior of the Igigu gods, the capable, prince of the gods, offspring of Ekur, the one who holds the bond of heaven and underworld, the one who opens springs, the one who walks the wide underworld, the god without whom no decisions are taken in heaven and underworld, the swift, the ferocious, the one whose command is unalterable, foremost in the (four) quarters, the one who gives scepter and (power of) decision to all cities, the stern canal-inspector (I 5) whose utterance cannot be altered, extensively capable, sage of the gods (ABGAL DINGIRmeš), the noble, the god Utulu, lord of lords, into whose hands is entrusted the circumference of heaven and underworld, king of battle, the hero who rejoices in battles, the triumphant, the perfect, lord of springs and seas, the angry (and) merciless whose attack is a deluge, the one who overwhelms enemy lands (and) fells the wicked, the splendid god who never once changes, light of heaven (and) underworld who illuminates the interior of the apsû, annihilator of the evil, subduer of the insubmissive, destroyer of enemies, the one whose command none of the gods in the divine assembly can alter, bestower of life, the compassionate god to whom it is good to pray, the one who dwells in Calah, great lord, my lord.145
I reproduce the table conceived by Amar Annus to illustrate the overlap in human and divine epithets, which is a product of the king’s mythologization as Ninurta (see next page).146 Other epithets include “avenger of Assyria” (muter gimil māt Aššur), first attested under Aššur-rēša-iši I,147 the “strong one” (gašru), first attested with Tiglath-Pileser I,148 and “to tread (kabāsu) upon the neck of the enemy” (En. el. ii 146, 148), and “to trample (dâšu) the enemies” (Anzû ii 47).149

The astralization of the gods Ninurta and Marduk also generated an astral mode of representation for their weapons. As Francesca Rochberg notes, the “mythological arrow of Ninurta (šukūdu) and that of Marduk (mulmullu) were given astral forms as Sirius and the Pleiades, respectively. The Astrolabe’s identification of the month of Ningirsu with the Pleiades echoes the personification of these stars as gods of war carrying bow and arrow.”150 Thus personification is attested in an inscription of Esarhaddon and in the Erra Epic.
6.6 War, Abundance, and the Astralization of the Warrior God
Two questions still in need of investigation are when and under what circumstances the awe-inspiring splendor, originally a feature of the divine, was extended to royal imagery in the way that it applies to Tukultī-Ninurta I in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic. I propose that the extension of this imagery to the king originates in the development of the warrior god Ninurta’s astral aspects. As we have seen, Ninurta was the model for the king in his role as defender against chaos. The rising significance of astrology beginning as early as the Old Babylonian period resulted in an increase in the astral modes of representation of the gods, including Ninurta. Following a period of several centuries, there emerged with Tukultī-Ninurta I a royal discourse that included the melammu-splendor as an essential feature of the image of the victorious warrior. It should be noted that the earliest compilation of the astrological omen series Enūma Anu Enlil dates to the Old Babylonian period,151 which implies that in

War, Abundance, and the Astralization of the Warrior God 263
terest in and knowledge of the movement of the heavenly bodies must have reached even further back in time. Three astral deities, Šulpaʾe, who is in later omen texts associated with Jupiter,152 Pabilsag, equated with Sagittarius already in the Old Babylonian period, and Numušda, a star in the path of Ea,153 appeared in association with Ningirsu/Ninurta in the time between the Ur III period (2112‒2004 BCE) and the Larsa period (2025‒1763 BCE). At the time of Gudea, Šulpaʾe had his own shrine in the local cult of the city of Lagaš and was associated with the palace (dšul-pa-è-é-gala8).154 Of interest is the fact that even the temple of Ninurta is said to have been adorned with the brightness of heaven (še-er-zi-an-na-ka),155 which might reflect the beginnings of an astral discourse centered on Ninurta. Šulpaʾe was also integrated into the pantheon of Nippur during the Ur III period, probably on account of his wife, the goddess Ninhursaga, who was already revered there.156 A Sumerian hymn dedicated to Šulpaʾe that possibly originated in this context already refers to the luminous quality of his appearance:
Hero, who shines forth like moonlight over the upper city! Hero Šulpaʾe, who shines forth like moonlight over the upper city! Eminent and famous Šulpaʾe, who shines forth like moonlight over the upper city. Lord of great divine powers (me), god who comes forth in glory (pa-e3). Šulpaʾe, of great divine powers, god who appears in glory, lordly in battle, who makes vegetation grow tall in the Land! Lord who raises his great arms, battle-club that smashes all enemies! Pre-eminent brother-in-law of Father Enlil. Good youth of Enlil. He has named your august name.157
Of further interest to our understanding of the figure of Ninurta is the fact that this hymn associates Šulpaʾe’s astral mode with his capacity to make vegetation grow and with his martial qualities. The concrete reference to an astral mode of divine representation – evident in the reference to Šulpaʾe’s luminous shine and splendor – has been overlooked in modern scholarship, perhaps because there are no astrological omen texts from the Ur III period. Ninurta, however, is associated with Pabilsag, who is later identified with Sagittarius in

Enlil has named your august name.



264 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
a song dedicated to the warrior deity. This song contains an interesting passage regarding the goddess Nanše, which indicates a station (ki-gub) for Ninurta and suggests that an astral aspect was formulated for the deity toward the end of the third millennium or at the beginning of the second millennium BCE at the latest:
Speak to holy Mother Nanše, so she will cast her protecting arms over you like Utu! May she indicate your station (ki-gub) for you. ...158
The hero is most precious; his word is august. He is the sun of the Land; the discloser of great counsel in É-ama-lamma. Ninurta is most precious. Pabilsag is most precious. Ningirsu is most precious; his word is august. He is the sun of the Land; the discloser of great counsel in É-ama-lamma.159
The theological discourse that developed around Šulpaʾe might have involved the rhetoric of light in its praise of Ninurta, as is exemplified by the following passage:
With the awesomeness that radiates from my forehead, which I make the foreign lands wear like a nose-rope, and the fear-inspiring luster, my personal weapon, which I impose on the Land like a neck-stock, I am able to root out and undo crime. I have the ability to reconcile great matters with one word.160
Both Šulpaʾe and Ninurta share the epithet “thronebearer of Enlil (gu-za-ládEn-líl-lá), which expresses the judicial agency of the god in the service of the chief deity of the pantheon. Both share the quality of the youthful hero whose principal activity is going to battle. Like Ningirsu/Ninurta, Šulpaʾe is the hero (ur-sag), the “battle-club that smashes the enemy” (giš-gaz gu2-erim2 ra) and “the rising flood” (a-gi6 zig3-ga). This evidence demonstrates that in the theological discourse that developed either during the Ur III period or in the Old Babylonian period, an association was made between the warrior-aspect of deities and their astralization. In the second millennium BCE, Šulpaʾe-Jupiter became the astral representation of the Babylonian chief god Marduk. In the first millennium text of the Erra Epic, when the god Erra threatens the cosmic order by depriving Marduk of his power the event is described in astral terms that refer to the divine splendor of Marduk’s planet:

War, Abundance, and the Astralization of the Warrior God 265
I will shake the netherworld and make heaven tremble, I will make Šulpaʾe (Jupiter) shed his splendor and remove the stars in the sky.161
The third deity with whom Ninurta was associated is Numušda, who is already attested in the Early Dynastic god lists from Fara and Abu Ṣalabīḥ. Numušda was considered to be the son of the moon god Nanna/Sîn, which possibly explains his astral aspect. Numušda shares martial characteristics with Ningirsu/ Ninurta, among them the epithets “snarling lion,” “battle net,” “great dragon,” and “fearsome flood.” Further, the beginning of King Sîn-iqišam of Larsa’s (1840‒1836 BCE) hymn to Numušda162 describes him as “Numušda, son of the prince, whose appearance is full of awe-inspiring radiance (me-lem4),” and refers to Numušda with epithets that are known from royal titularies. Among these are the image of a favorable destiny being determined for him while he was still in the womb,163 and the choosing of justice (níg-zid) and annihilation of wickedness (níg-erim2).164 The theological discourse centered on Ninurta/Ningirsu at the end of the third millennium thus reveals a growing accumulation of functions and roles, which was achieved by means of association with other gods. This accumulation of functions and roles also demonstrates a concern with Ninurta/Ningirsu’s astral aspect, which, as I suggest, laid the foundations for the ideological adoption of the melammu-splendor by the king. Terrifying divine splendor is at first attested sporadically as a quality assigned to the Ur III kings and later to some Old Babylonian kings. Under Tukultī-Ninurta I, terrifying divine splendor developed into an important trope that served to convey the overwhelming martial power that the king directed against his enemies:
(10′) Glorious is his (the king’s) vehemence (šarrahat mamlūssu); it scor[ches the dis]respectful in front and rear. 11′ Glowing is his aggressiveness (qāʾedat irhūssu); it burns the disobedient to the left and right. 12′ His radiances are frightful (melammūšu); they overwhelm all the enemies.165
Although the trope of terrifying divine splendor remained restricted to the textual medium in Assyria, in later periods under the Sassanian kings the halo became an important visual icon that distinguished the king from the rest of

266 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
the people, identifying him as a rightful and powerful agent of the god – a role already apparent in the Neo-Assyrian state rituals.166 During the second half of the second millennium BCE, scholars revived the ancient association of Ningirsu with agriculture, as is expressed in his role as “master of the flood” in an Old Babylonian period Sumerian balbale-song to Ninurta.167 This revival served to frame the trope of abundance guaranteed by the agency of the god, which is expressed in astral terms. In this context, Ninurta is also associated with the Sebetti, i.e. their astral representation the Pleiades, because their heliacal rising in early summer and their disappearance in November marks the agricultural periods of harvest and sowing. Accordingly, control over the Sebetti/Pleiades was of prime importance and represented a major theme in the mythological discourse centered on the warrior deities Ningirsu/Ninurta and later Marduk. The relationship between Ningirsu and the Pleiades is apparent in Astrolabe B, the earliest known example of which dates to the Middle Assyrian period and was written by Marduk-balāssu-ēreš, the son of the royal scholar (ṭupšar šarri) Ninurta-uballissu, who worked in the service of the Assyrian king in the city of Aššur.168 In contrast to the astronomical instruments that measure the altitude of the stars, the function of the Mesopotamian astrolabes was to identify the stars that rose each month in the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. In the menology of Astrolabe B, the rising of stars in the Path of Ea was connected with agricultural work. Ajjaru, the month of the Pleiades, is said to be the month of the ‘opening of the soil’169 and is additionally associated with Ningirsu:
166 See above. 167 Balbale Song to Ninurta (Ninurta F), ETCSL 4.27.06: “Through the king, flax is born, through the king, barley is born. Through him, carp floods are made plentiful in the river. Through him, fine grains are made to grow in the fields. Through him carp are made plentiful in the lagoons. Through him, mature and fresh reeds are made to grow in the reed thickets. Through him, fallow deer and wild sheep are made plentiful in the forests. Through him mashgurum trees are made to grow in the high desert. Through him, syrup and wine are made plentiful in the watered gardens. Through him, life which is long is made to grow in the palace.” Ninurta’s role of controlling the “turbulent waters of the Tigris that return to Girsu during the flood season from the great mountain ranges” (George 2011, 9 i 2) in the East has another metaphorical meaning as illustrated by the following quote from Gudea Cyl. A viii 15‒16: lugalmu dNin-gír-su en a huš gi4‒a en-zi a kur-gal ri-a “My master Ningirsu, lord who is fierce waters that returned (or: were sent back) (during the flood season), true lord who is water/ semen ejaculated by the Great Mountain (i.e., Enlil).” In the words of George 2011, 9 “this wonderful poetic image harks back to the beginning of Cylinder A (i 5‒9), where the outpouring of Enlil’s fatherly love for Ningirsu is likened to the overflowing Tigris ‒ in turn equated with Enlil’s heart, which brings forth sweet water, i.e. Ningirsu.” 168 Horowitz 1998, 159 n. 17 and 2011, 104. 169 Horowitz 1998, 164.

(To) the month Ajjaru (belong) the Pleiades, the Seven, the great gods. Opening of the ground. The oxen are prepared. The flooding canal(?) is opened. The plows are washed. It is the month of the hero Ningirsu, The great administrator of Enlil.170
Control of the Pleiades was significant insofar as their conjunction with the moon was considered to be of devastating consequence, as is described in the astrological omen series Enūma Anu Enlil: ‘When the Pleiades stand in the moon, there will be death and the Sebetti will devour the land.’171 The association of Ninurta’s astral aspect with the growth of vegetation is further evident in a Šu-ila prayer addressed to Kaksisa-Ninurta:
You, Kaksisa-Ninurta, foremost of the great gods, Runner along the pure heavens, Utaulu, whose battle has no equal, Powerful firstborn, beloved of Nunnamnir, Legitimate farmer, who heaps up the crop in mounds Who piles up the grain, who saves the life of all the people.172
Because of the prominence of astrology and the rise of astronomy during the first millennium, the astral associations of Ninurta became more and more evident. This is apparent in the so-called Neo-Assyrian Syncretic Hymn to Ninurta:
Your eyelids, O lord are the twins Sîn [and Šamaš], Your eyebrows are the corona of the sun that [ ], Your mouth’s shape, O lord, is the evening star, Anu and Antu are your lips, your speech [is Nusku?], Your discoursing tongue(?) is Pabilsag (Sagittarius), who [ ] on high, The roof of your mouth O lord, is the circumference of heaven and earth, abode of [ ], Your teeth are the Seven (Pleiades), who slay evildoers.173
The scholarly shaping of Marduk as the heroic warrior involved the adoption and elaboration of Ninurta’s astral aspects in Enūma Eliš, in the Erra Epic, in cultic commentaries, and in a myth that formed part of the incantation series utukkū lemnūtu. The Pleiades represent the seven sons of the warrior deity En

mešarra in a Neo-Assyrian cultic commentary, which comments as follows on day 19 of the month Šabatu:
The 19th day, which they call the Silence, is when he vanquished Anu and the Pleiades, the sons of Enmešarra.174
Astronomical texts generally lack an explanation for lunar eclipses. A bilingual historiola that forms part of the utukkū lemnūtu exorcistic series, however, provides a mythological explanation for lunar eclipses that involves the agency of Marduk.175 The seven evil demons (utukkū lemnūtu) are merged with the Pleiades and associated with Anu like in the Erra Epic. The historiola relies on the astral observation of the conjunction of the moon and the Pleiades to explain the astral phenomenon of the lunar eclipse, which appears to reflect some tension between Enlil and Anu:
When Enlil heard that report (of the Seven causing darkness), He took the matter to heart. With Ea, the lofty leader of the gods, he took counsel and (as a result) Sîn (the moon god), Šamaš (the sun god), and Ištar (Venus) he installed to keep the horizon in order. With Anu he (Enlil) had them (Sun, Moon and Venus) share the rulership of all the heavens. Unto these three, the gods, his children He commanded them their night and day ‒ unceasing ‒ standing. When those Seven, the evil gods Break loose in the horizon, Confronting Nannar-Sîn, ferociously they encircle (him) completely.176
As a counteraction, Ea calls upon his son Marduk to rescue the moon:
Ea called his son Marduk, and informed him of the matter. “Go, Marduk, my son! The son of the prince, Nannar-Sîn, who is evilly dark in the sky His eclipse in the heavens is clearly visible. The Seven, they, evil gods, the fearless deathcausers, they, The Seven, they, evil gods who like the Great Flood Rise up and sweep over the country, Upon the land like the storm they rise up.

Confronting Nannar-Sîn, ferociously they encircle (him) completely.”177
This 7th century historiola can be related to an image on an astrological tablet from the Seleucid period that deals with lunar eclipses (fig. 45). The image depicts the Pleiades, the lunar disc with a man and a dragon who is coiled around the moon’s perimeter, and Taurus. Although Ann Kilmer interprets the man as Marduk (alias Jupiter?), it is more precisely Marduk having absorbed the functions of Ninurta who rescues the moon with his magic club in his right hand and a rhombus-shaped dagger in his left hand, with which he stabs the dragon. These few examples suffice to reveal the cosmic implications of the king’s role as the warrior god Ninurta, which in the ancient weltanschauung went far beyond the battle between ‘good and evil’. Any time the Assyrian king went on a military campaign to fight the enemy it was the cosmic balance itself that was at stake in mythological and theological terms. Among his other accomplishments, it was the king’s military success that was thought to guarantee prosperity and abundance. The close relationship in royal discourse between war and abundance can, however, only be fully grasped with an understanding of the astral aspects of divine prototypes like the warrior god. I am by no means reviving the older notion of Mesopotamian religion as an astral religion, but I would like to emphasize that we cannot understand either certain juxtapositions and constellations of gods in theological lists and other contexts or the grouping of certain themes such as war and abundance without considering the astral aspects associated with the divine prototypes. The seeming unrelat

270 The Mythical Foundations of the King’s Role as Ninurta
edness of the roles of the king as Ninurta – divine administrator, warrior, and guarantor of abundance and prosperity – becomes intelligible if we understand these roles in light of the king’s belligerent and masculine staging, since royal masculinity was a necessary prerequisite for the successful performance of the functions that guaranteed the social and cosmic order.

7.1 Experience, Expertise and Knowledge: The King’s Place in the Cosmic Scheme
Read from a diachronic perspective, the plotline of the Assyrian royal inscriptions does not remain restricted to that of the combat myth as conceived in the Middle Assyrian period. Another important trope, which emerges under the Middle Assyrian king Tukultī-Ninurta I (1233‒1197 BCE), is that of the capable, intelligent, and wise ruler who shares in divine knowledge. This trope is subsequently elaborated in the first millennium, initially in the Standard Babylonian Gilgameš Epic and then in the Sargonid royal inscriptions. Tukultī-Ninurta I includes the trope of the wise ruler in his titulary in one of the later building inscriptions from his newly built residence in Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta, which was constructed following his conquest of Babylonia:
Tukultī-Ninurta, strong king, king of all people, prince, vice-regent of Aššur, the foremost purification priest, ruler of rulers, the able favorite of Enlil (teleʾû migir dEnlil), rightful shepherd, king (whose) decree cannot be rivaled, designate of Anu, the one who understands (pīt hasīsi), the wise one (eršu), who reaches the utmost boundaries of wisdom (gāmer pāṭ nēmeqi), the beloved of Niššiku (namad dNiššiki),1 the pure one, worthy representative of the scepter and the tiara (= kingship: simat haṭṭi u agê) ...2
It is tempting to view Tukultī-Ninurta I’s choice of the trope of the wise ruler as a consequence of his conquest of Babylon, which – according to the TukultīNinurta Epic – occasioned the transfer of multiple scholarly and literary tablets to libraries in Aššur. It is likely that this transfer of knowledge also included the migration and perhaps even the deportation of Babylonian scholars to the Assyrian court, who then participated in the shaping of royal discourse. Both the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic and the royal inscription quoted above strongly suggest the involvement of Babylonian scholars in their composition, as does the production of Sumero-Babylonian bilinguals during the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I.3 Indeed, Tukultī-Ninurta I’s self-praise mirrors the praise of the god Nabû at the end of his epic, thus representing another example of the king adopting a particular set of characteristics associated with a specific divinity. The appearance of the trope of the knowledgeable king in Assyrian royal discourse constitutes an example of the revival of a particular trope which in earlier times
1 The use of the term nammadu is quite unusual, see CAD N/1, 207, s.v. namaddu B. 2 Deller, Fadhil, and Ahmad 1994, 464‒465. 3 See also Chapter 3.5.3.1.



272 The King’s Share in Divine Knowledge
had figured in poetic texts like the royal self-praises of the kings of Ur, for instance, rather than in what we traditionally consider to be historical inscriptions. As a model for kingship, the trope of the wise and knowledgeable ruler is first negotiated in mythic literature. The presence of texts like the originally Old Babylonian period Cuthean Legend and the Gilgameš Epic in the Assyrian royal libraries indicates the significance that the Sargonid rulers attributed to the trope of sharing in and controlling divine knowledge – Sumerian nam-kùzu, “pure, sacred knowledge,” Akkadian nēmequ – which “reinforced the sense of loyalty to the established order.”4 As Bendt Alster notes,5 this knowledge included the cultural knowledge of the king in his role as judge establishing civic order; knowledge of correct ritual performance and magic, the origins of which were traced back to the god Ea; scribal knowledge; and experience gained from life and handed down from legendary figures such as Atrahasīs, Gilgameš, Adapa, Šuruppak, and Ahiqar. The notion that semi-divine figures transmitted their knowledge of the skills of civilization to humankind survives in Berossos’ Babylōniaká, in which the fish-man Oannes (Mesopotamian: Adapa) features as cultural hero.6 Although the primary meaning of the term hasīsu and its derivatives is “aperture of the ear” and “(faculty) of hearing,” the term also represents skilled knowledge of the kind required for the building of temples, for fashioning statues, for casting bronze, and for a broad range of comparable activities. All of this knowledge was subsumed under the umbrella term nēmequ. The term hasīsu designates the acquisition of such knowledge from exclusive professional circles or from within the family;7 once in possession of such knowledge, both professional circles and skilled families guarded it through generations. Ultimately, however, practical knowledge was conceived as being derived from the gods. This is indicated by the Old Babylonian Sumerian poem Inanna and Enki, which lists professional skills in the list of the me,8 as well as by the divinities that epitomize specific professions. First millennium texts like the Catalogue of Texts and Authors and the Enmeduranki Legend similarly trace various compendia pertaining to professional knowledge back to the gods.9 In this conception,

skill, expertise, and what the modern mind perceives as human ingenuity are all derived from the gods rather than from one’s own cognitive faculties. The gods could and sometimes did share their knowledge with the king; in the Enmeduranki Legend, for instance, the gods share their knowledge with King Enmeduranki, who then shares it with his scholars. Practical knowledge is included in divine knowledge, imbuing it with symbolic meaning. This is central to understanding later Assyrian royal inscriptions, in which any technical or cultural achievement serves as a powerful idiom for highlighting the king’s participation in the cosmic scheme. Interestingly, the trope of the knowledgeable king falls away after Tukultī-Ninurta I, to be revived only under the Sargonid kings, who describe themselves as wise or knowledgeable (eršu),10 capable (lēʾû), experienced (itpēšu), intelligent (hassu), learned (mūdû),11 informed (muntalku),12 circumspect and trustworthy (pitqudu),13 and broad of understanding (šadal karše),14 thereby cultivating an image of professionalism and “technical and informational competency.”15 In one of the few inscriptions that give his other name, Esarhaddon (680‒669 BCE) makes a special case for having acquired expertise in all scholarly knowledge:
[Aššur-eṭel-ilāni]-mukīn-apli, the crown prince who (resides in) in palace of Succession, [... is comp]lete, surpassing in intelligence, [...] whose mind has been educated ... of all scholarship, ...16

Irene Winter’s rendering “cunning/lit. intelligence, inspiration of the heart” (Winter 2008, 336 fn. 31) comes close to the original meaning, though it would be better to omit the notion of inspiration as well as the ‘heart’ in the modern sense, since the Akkadian libbu is understood as the seat of the rational mind. 10 Seux 1967, 22. 11 For this sequence of adjectives see Esarhaddon’s Nineveh A Inscription, RINAP 4 no. 1 col. ii 18‒19. 12 Esarhaddon, Aššur-Babylon A Inscription (AsBbA), RINAP 4 no. 48:24. 13 See entries under CAD P, 441 f., s.v. pitqudu. 14 Sargon II, TCL 3 23. 15 Holloway 2002, 83. 16 Nineveh J = RINAP 4 no. 13 1‒3.



274 The King’s Share in Divine Knowledge
cal,17 but cultural knowledge was nevertheless defined differently in different historical contexts. Although knowledge was ultimately derived from the gods, the Sumero-Babylonian tradition conceived of knowledge as residing with the mythical kings in the time before the flood, and with Ziusudra in particular, as is reflected in the Sumerian text The Instructions of Šuruppak.18 Šuruppak’s instructions to his son Ziusudra comprise teachings fundamental to civilized life19 and include entirely practical concerns linked to agriculture, irrigation, and animal husbandry. The Old Babylonian version of the text introduces Šuruppak as the wise man, who tells his son to obey his instructions. Another Sumerian text, The Instructions of Ur-Ninurta,20 demonstrates that the practical human undertakings included in the realm of cultural knowledge were considered essential to the cult of the gods. Accordingly, civilized life implied a relationship between kingship and knowledge of how to ensure the continuity of civilization as established by the mythic culture heroes from before the flood. To ensure proper provisioning of the gods, the king had to guarantee social order and justice so that civilized life would be maintained. The king did so by drawing on primeval knowledge from the time before the flood and transmitted over generations down to the time in which the king lived; in other words, the king ostensibly maintained order by upholding established traditions and conventions.21 Some curses at the end of commemorative royal inscriptions instruct the king’s successors to read the stele or foundation tablet on which the inscriptions are written and to treat these objects in a ritually correct way before returning them to their proper place. It is these inscriptions that best encapsulate the cultural discourse emphasizing respect for and adherence to the past. An explicit admonition is expressed in the Cuthean Legend, which appears to have informed the beginning of the Standard Babylonian Gilgameš Epic:
Cuthean Legend (Standard Babylonian Version) 149‒180
149 You, whoever you are, be it governor or prince or anyone else, 150 whom the gods will call to perform kingship, 151 I made a tablet-box for you and inscribed a stele for you.
17 See Alster 2005, 21 who argues for abandoning the notion of ‘wisdom literature’. For earlier discussions on the notion of knowledge and wisdom see Galter 1983; Sweet 1990; Wilcke 1991; Denning-Bolle 1992; Pongratz-Leisten 1999, 286 ff.; Winter 2008. 18 Alster 2005, 31‒220. 19 Beaulieu 2007b, 6. 20 Alster 2005, 221‒264. 21 Note that níg-gi-na = kittu ‘stability, cosmic order’ directly follows the office of kingship and its insignia, as well as priesthood, Farber-Flügge 1973, 54‒55 II v 16.

According to both the Cuthean Legend and the Gilgameš Epic, two elements were essential to correct royal behavior in mediating the interdependence of the divine and human world: ensuring the continuation of civilization and passing on relevant knowledge to future occupants of the office of kingship. Any failure with respect to either of these responsibilities led irrevocably to abandonment by the gods and, implicitly, to the ultimate collapse of the cosmic order. As such, the king served as mediator between the primordial past and the historical present. The expectations linked to the institution of kingship explain the overall idea of the Assyrian royal inscriptions, which in addition to referencing warfare, the hunt, and care of the cult, include utopian visions ranging from the rhetoric of abundance24 to the rhetoric of social equality25 and the mastering of technical expertise. All of these references and visions attempt in some way to demonstrate and affirm the king’s fulfillment of the expectations connected to his office. The idea that it was important for kings to record their experiences in written form, implying the importance of the transmission of knowledge of rulership to future generations, was not restricted to the Cuthean Legend and the Gilgameš Epic. This idea also appears in the Synchronistic History, a Neo-Assyrian text that survives in three copies from Ashurbanipal’s Library; the text is written in Standard Babylonian and contains a number of Assyrianisms. Like the Entemena Cylinder from Pre-Sargonic Lagaš, which regulates the boundary between Umma and Lagaš, and like the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, which focuses on diplomatic agreements between Assyria and Babylonia, the Synchronistic History places the treaty between Assyria and Babylonia concerning their mutual boundaries at the center of its narrative. Indeed, the continued violation of this treaty by the Babylonians constitutes the text’s basic content, these violations being followed time and again by the victories of various Assyrian kings who manage to re-establish the borders specified by the treaty. In the text’s conclusion, its author speaks of the fact that the Synchronistic History was inscribed
23 George 2003, 539 f. This combination of the trope of the hero as expressed in the passage “the surpassing one of (all) kings” (šūtur eli šarrī) and in that of the knowledgeable king is already attested in the version from Ugarit (Arnaud 2007), although it is anchored differently in the narrative structure (see George 2007). For the various prologues of the epic see most recently Sasson 2013. 24 Winter 2003. 25 Pongratz-Leisten 2005.

on a stele in order to exhort future rulers to take the necessary measures to ensure that they would not fall short of their predecessors:
Synchronistic History iv 23‒26
Let a later prince who wishes to achieve fame in Akkad, write about the prowess of [his] victories. [Let him] continually [turn] to this [very] stele (and) [look at it] that it may not be forgotten.
Finally, a similar concern can be observed in the so-called Weidner Chronicle.26 The Weidner Chronicle is in the form of a letter and is said to be written by a king of Isin to the king of Babylon. The text only survives in copies from the first millennium, one of which was found in the House of the Exorcist in Aššur. In this text, the advice (amāt šitulti, “word of deliberation/consultation”, l.3) given by one ruler to the other concerns the proper administration of the cult of Marduk in Babylon; the recipient of the letter is, however, reproached for failing to heed such instruction (urtu), and the king of Isin therefore relates his experience (alaktu), cast in a dream-vision in which he receives advice from the goddess Gula. The text represents a unique creation that alternates between good and bad kings and descriptions of their administration of Marduk’s cult. It is steeped in the tradition of the Sumerian King List and in the omen traditions centered on the kings of Akkad, and its structure is reminiscent of the literary predictive texts, i.e. the Akkadian Prophecies.27 While the Weidner Chronicle is explicitly concerned with the cult of Marduk, the Advice to a Prince, which is known from Ashurbanipal’s Library, focuses on the king’s treatment of the citizens of Babylon, Sippar, and Nippur. As observed by Lambert, the aim of the text is to protect the citizens of these cities “from taxation, forced labor, and misappropriation of their property.”28 The Advice to a Prince is written in the style of the omen compendia and is a serious political statement regarding the privileges of the citizens of the central Babylonian cultic centers, a concern that is especially apparent in the inscriptions of Sargon II.29 It is addressed to kings in general and to the foreign (=Assyrian) king in particular, and thus represents another indication of the belief that the king’s actions were supposed to conform to established traditions defining the office of kingship in this case the granting of privileges to certain cities. The texts discussed above represent variations on the subject of correct royal conduct, and their intertextual relationships reveal the erudition and creativity of the scholars at the Assyrian court.

7.2 The Trope of Abundance and Technical Expertise
The trope of mastering technical expertise, i.e. of human ingenuity with respect to improving living conditions and providing better care for the gods, was clearly of great importance to the author of the late version of the Gilgameš Epic. In Assyrian cultural discourse the emphasis on technical knowledge and practical information emerges in the Middle Assyrian period, in which Assyrian kings began elaborating on the trope of abundance in very concrete terms. As Irene Winter notes, the trope of abundance is always linked to water.30 Although they stress their service to the gods, the Assyrian kings also point to their building of canals to provide for the cultivation of the crops that secure the subsistence of the city. This discourse was originally based in the topographical conditions of the city of Aššur. In contrast to the other Assyrian royal residences, which are all located in rich agricultural zones, Aššur is situated on a natural spur at the edge of the dry-farming belt, a highly unfavorable location necessitating the transport of water to the city’s temples, palaces, and residential quarters. The Old Assyrian ruler Ilu-šumma is the first to mention construction that was intended to secure Aššur’s water supply:
The god Aššur opened for me two springs in Mount Abih and I made bricks for the wall by these two springs. The water of one spring flowed down to the Aušum Gate (while) the water of the other spring flowed down to the Wertum Gate.31
By the Middle Assyrian period, kings sought to meet Aššur’s growing water needs by building major canal systems. In one of his inscriptions, Tukultī-Ninurta I (1233‒1197 BCE) relates that he redirected the ‘Canal of Justice’, which had formerly provided water for Aššur, in order to water the fields surrounding his newly built residence Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta.32 This was not a minor project,33 but Tukultī-Ninurta I’s successor Aššur-nādin-apli (1196‒1193 BCE) reversed it probably because Tukultī-Ninurta I’s actions jeopardized Aššur’s water supply.34 Aššur-bēl-kala (1073‒1056 BCE) boasts that he re-excavated the source of a canal that had been dug by Aššurdan I (1168‒1133 BCE) in order to provide Aššur with water.35 A similar discourse is apparent in Aššurnaṣirpal II’s

(883‒859 BCE) relocation of his residence to the city of Calah, which he provided with water by means of a canal drawing from the Upper Zab.36 The emergence of this cultural discourse in the textual sources is accompanied by the appearance of the stylized tree in the palace decoration of TukultīNinurta I, the precise representation of which varies until the reign of Shalmaneser III. Earlier scholarship associated the stylized tree, which is often flanked by protective genii, with the pollination of the date palm,37 but later interpretations have considered it either as an “emblem of the provisioning of the land and the role of the king in relation to it,”38 or as a symbol of fertility and cosmic order.39 Because the date palm is not central to Assyrian agricultural production,40 its choice as a visual metaphor for abundance requires an explanation. Barbara Porter’s association of the date palm with Ištar, a connection that extends to the beginnings of Mesopotamian history,41 seems the most plausible link, and it has the additional merit of being supported by representations of Ištar and the palm tree on ivories and alabaster vessels.42 Assyrian ideological discourse does not link the image of the date palm exclusively to fertility; rather, it associates the date palm also with the king’s capacity for proper action, which is guaranteed by his communication with the divine world through Ištar, who mediates between the gods and the king to that end.43 Under Tiglath-Pileser I (1114‒1076 BCE), utilitarian descriptions of the construction of canals and the undertaking of other measures to improve the supply of water to Aššur are supplemented by the much less practical building of landscape gardens44 for the king’s “lordly leisure” (kirî rišâte).45 These descriptions represent an ideological exploitation of technical knowledge, as TiglathPileser I’s introduction of the landscape garden – replete with large numbers of exotic plants and animals – served as a further means of displaying the image of the king as having domesticated the forces of chaos and having brought them fully under his control.46 Tiglath-Pileser I thus set the stage for

the imagery of huge parks (fig. 46) and hunting grounds depicted in the NeoAssyrian reliefs, which in turn functioned as the model for the Persian paridaiḏa ‘walled enclosure, pleasure park, garden’.47 During the next major expansion of the Assyrian empire in the ninth century, Aššurnaṣirpal II (883859 BCE) went “out of his way to record the often exotic tress, cuttings, and seed which were retrieved on his campaigns, and which were then planted within the bounds of his new garden at Nimrud.”48 Far beyond signaling the king’s pleasure, the royal gardens came to underline the cosmic role of the king “in assuring the fertility and fruitfulness of the land as a whole.”49 When he built his new capital Khorsabad, Sargon II (722‒705 BCE) also established a royal garden, which he compares to Mount Amanus and in which he says he

planted every tree of Hatti and the plants of every mountain; in this way, Sargon II exploits the ideological potential of his garden to mirror and manifest his control of the world. Royal discourse centered on skill and knowledge developed further under Sennacherib (704‒681 BCE), whose Bavian Inscription emphasizes the technical details of his construction of a complex infrastructure for the provision of water to Nineveh. In contrast to earlier royal inscriptions, which follow the sequential rhetoric of the chaîne opératoire of the king’s actions – titulary, military account, building account – the invocation of the gods in Sennacherib’s Bavian Inscription is followed by an account of the irrigation system he built around Nineveh and only then proceeds to the narrative of his military success, in this case the destruction of Babylon (figs. 47‒49). In his account of the construction of the hydraulic system that was to supply Nineveh and its surroundings with water, Sennacherib dwells at great length on technical details:
At that time I greatly enlarged the abode of Nineveh. Its wall and the outer wall thereof, which had not existed before, I built anew and raised mountain-high. Its fields, which through lack of water had turned into wasteland, and came to look like holes? so that its people did not know water for irrigation but (instead) used to wait for rain to fall from the sky, (these fields) I watered, and from the villages of ... 17 GN ..., the waters, which were above the town of Hadabiti, (through) eighteen canals, which I dug, I directed their course towards the Khosr River. From the border of he town Kisiri to the midst of Nineveh I had a canal dug and brought those waters down therein. Sennacherib-Canal, I called its name. And the surplus of those waters I led out through the midst of Mount Tas, a difficult mountain, on the border of Akkad. ...50
The Bavian Inscription further details the building measures that ensured the provision of water for the orchards and vineyards of Nineveh and the fields around it. This first section of the inscription concludes with the dedication of the canal from Tarbisu to Nineveh and a description of Sennacherib’s generous payment to the workmen. The Bavian Inscription’s building account emphasizes Sennacherib’s mastery of hydraulic techniques51 and functions like an extended year name, as the preamble to the second part of the inscription, which narrates the military account, begins as follows: “in the same year with the opening of that canal, which I dug, ...” A description of Sennacherib’s military campaign against Elam and Babylon follows, resulting in the destruction of Babylon by means of flooding. Only after the narrative regarding Babylon’s destruction does the king resume his description of the construction of the canal system, which concludes

with a reference to six steles that were set up at the source of the canal in mount Tas and which are said to bear an image of Sennacherib himself in reverential pose, praying to the gods (lābin appi) depicted above him. Sennacherib’s Bavian Inscription thus combines the two key metaphors of the king: first, the monarch assumes the beneficial role of Ninurta as patron of agriculture controlling the waters of the mountains and guiding them into the Mesopotamian plain (Lugal-e 355 ff.).52 Second, the devastating effect of Ninurta’s onrushing flood – one of Ninurta’s weapons as known from Assyrian royal inscriptions and the much earlier myths of Lugal-e and Angimdimma53 – is manifest in the king’s destruction of Babylon. In the Sumerian poem Fields of Ninurta, Ninurta is credited with the invention of agriculture and its tools,54 a

In the text The Fields of Ninurta, Ninurta is equally introduced as the son of Enlil, and depicted in charge of all the fields of Nippur. The text survives in several Ur III fragments and at least eight Old Babylonian witnesses from Nippur. About 160 lines of the text are preserved which originally may have had as manyas 280 lines (see Rubio 2003, 205). In this text “a lexical template has been expanded and interdigitated with predicates, which fashioned it into a literary work.” (Rubio 2003, 207).

trope revived under Sennacherib’s son and successor Esarhaddon, who wrote his name in astroglyphs and included the plough as a symbol of Ninurta.55 Sennacherib’s significant investment in what was probably a summer residence and gardens at the site of Bavian – decorated with several reliefs showing him either riding his horse into battle (fig. 47) or in adoration of the gods Aššur and Ištar-Mullissu (figs. 48 and 49) – demonstrate the great importance the Assyrian king assigned to his hydraulic achievements.

Similarly, it is Sennacherib with his interest in technical knowledge who introduced the trope comparing the king to Adapa, one of the seven sages in the entourage of Ea, the god of practical knowledge. A Seleucid text lists Adapa as the first among the seven sages,56 juxtaposing legendary and historical kings with their chief scholars. Indeed, during the first millennium BCE “Uʾanna/Adapa, known under the form Oannes in Berossos, became the archetype of antediluvian knowledge and wisdom.”57 Although the Verse Account, a propaganda text directed against the late Babylonian king Nabonidus (555‒539 BCE), reflects the rising claim of the learned elites to intellectual and religious leadership and thus challenges the monarchical monopoly on knowledge,58 the association of kings with scholars in Sargonid Assyria appears to have a solely positive connotation, as it enhances the king’s operational capacities in ruling his empire.59 In a bull inscription detailing the building of his new Palace-Without-Rival in Nineveh, Sennacherib extols himself in the following terms:
56 See most recently Lenzi 2008a and 2008b with discussion of earlier bibliography. 57 Beaulieu 2007c, 161. 58 Ibid. 59 Pongratz-Leisten 1999, 310 f.

Ninšiku (Ea) provided me with broad knowledge (karšu ritpašu) equal to the sage Adapa (šinnat apkalli Adapa), he is the one who gave me sharp intelligence.60
In the same way, Sennacherib emphasizes his knowledge of bronze-casting in his inscription related to the construction of the gates of the akītu house:
I constructed a red bronze gate, which as to its metal b[ands] was the work of the smith god Ninagal, and of my own ingenuity ... I assembled silver, gold and bronze in the form of rings. I myself, as one who understands the matters involved, am capable of breaking up utensils of silver, gold, and red bronze – from one thousand talents to one shekel, to crush together and undertake their smelting.61
The royal effort to publicize the king’s personal technical knowledge and achievements conflicts with the cultural norm that regarded cities and their institutions as having originated in mythic times. In the above-cited statements of Sennacherib, cultural reluctance to overtly accept and explicitly refer to any kind of innovation or progress probably informs the respective coupling of the king with the sage Adapa and the smith-god Ninagal. By connecting the king’s achievements to these figures, the king is associated with the legitimate sources of the relevant skilled knowledge within ideological discourse and the king’s personal claims are thus linked with the mythic past. Nonetheless, royal discourse does reveal a growing tendency toward a form of self-reflection that aims at historicizing the ideal paradigm of kingship and identifies that ideal with incumbent kings. This emphasis on technical expertise and enthusiasm for the detailed narration of technical accomplishments compares with the military accounts, which convey relevant geographical information regarding past campaigns with utmost precision and present long lists of the names of conquered cities, sometimes accompanied by descriptions of their landscapes, flora and fauna, and ethnic particularities. Since these geographical descriptions can include additional information concerning the nature of the booty and tribute collected for the Assyrian temples, they can be read as variations on the theme of the king providing for the cult. Interest in technical details was abandoned under Ashurbanipal, making way for the trope of the king as learned scholar versed in divination. The theme of abundance is disconnected from the successful application of hydraulic expertise and is instead entirely mythologized, with the gods taking center stage.

This is apparent in the introduction to one of Ashurbanipal’s most important building inscriptions, Prism A:
Since Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Šarrat-Kidmuri, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal, and Nusku let me take a seat on the throne of my father, my begetter, Adad, released the rains, Ea opened his springs, the grain grew in its furrows five ells long, the ear grew 5/6 ells long, the crop prospered, abundance of Nisaba, the grasslands grew steadily and abundantly, the orchards abounded in fruit, the cattle gave birth easily. During my reign, abundance (hé-nun=nuhšu) and plenty (ṭuhdu), during my years bountiful produce (hegallu) was heaped up.62
This reading of Assyrian royal inscriptions represents a slightly different take on what Fales defined as the “positive position,” which regards their narrative as a “particular mix of outright informative data, ideological biases, and literary alterations” that should be understood “in the light of a long-standing stream of tradition and for preservation in future memory.”63 Assuming that the narrative structure of these inscriptions follows a particular chaîne opératoire that suits the ancient cosmology, I strongly suggest that they should be read through the lens of myth and contextualized within their broader religious framework, which anticipates the king’s assumption of the role of the victorious warrior god Ninurta. All additional tropes or historical details should be considered secondary insofar as these did not alter the primary message contained in the plotline of the combat myth.
7.3 The chaîne opératoire of Royal Performance and the Assyrian Enthusiasm for Detail
Tiglath-Pileser I (1114‒1076 BCE) was the first king to develop the formal structure of Assyrian royal inscriptions in a way that weaved together the tropes of warfare, hunt, the building of the temple, and the resulting prosperity granted by the gods into a sequence that formed a coherent and meaningful narrative. This new compositional ‘architecture’64 or chaîne opératoire – to borrow a term used by Marcel Mauss and his pupil André Leroi-Gourhan to conceptualize technical processes and their social effects65 – was meant to demonstrate that

The chaîne opératoire of Royal Performance 287
the occupant of the office of kingship had fulfilled his mission on all levels. In this chaîne opératoire, the final trope of building the temple served as the key metaphor that signaled the king’s successful reign over a community; this community was willingly subject to the civic order that the king established through key actions such as the hunt, warfare, and righteous judgment. Royal actions of this kind must thus be seen in the context of their ideological potential to shape and engender social and political communities, rather than being reduced to the level of purely technical procedures. Correct social organization, ideally brought about through royal agency, enabled humankind to carry out the tasks of building the temple, excavating the canals, and working the fields, the ultimate purpose of which was to contribute to the proper cult of the gods. In other words, these royal actions must be read from the perspective of their cultural value in the ancient weltanschauung, i.e. as a royal response to the expectations attached to the office of kingship. This reading helps explain why in the visual arts, and especially on the steles distributed throughout the empire, the Assyrian king is represented as a priest rather than as a warrior or hunter. Similarly, at the end of scenes of hunting and warfare the king is depicted libating over the slaughtered animal or the subjugated foe. The pacification of the world was thought to be an ongoing process, but royal representation emphasized both the process and the ideal outcome. By reiterating the chaîne opératoire conceived by Tiglath-Pileser I in their various commemorative and dedicatory inscriptions, the Assyrian kings demonstrated that they had lived up to their duties and indicated to the gods that their respective tenures merited divine support. Moreover, in a performative manner the monarchs re-enacted the ongoing process of pacifying the world and establishing the social order envisioned by normative cultural tradition. By adhering to the customary plotline in their narratives, Assyrian kings also transmitted the notion of the ideal “correct sequence of action” to their successors in written form. Indeed, it is precisely the “correct” sequential execution of royal tasks that defined the Assyrian view of the practical knowledge associated with rulership. The king’s performance of the royal tasks rooted in cultural memory and formulated in the Anzû Myth aligned him with his predecessors and ultimately linked him back to the primeval period in which kingship passed from heaven to earth. Hence, every king in one way or another promulgated this message in his inscriptions carefully, inscribing it on statues, steles, or the walls of palaces and temples. The intention was to persuade the audience, which included the king’s successors and the gods themselves, that the king had followed the proper course of action and carried out his duties. Over time the royal inscriptions became more and more elaborate with regard to information about geographical, historical, and technical savoir-faire,



288 The King’s Share in Divine Knowledge
leading modern scholars to compare them to modern historiography. These inscriptions cannot, however, meet modern historiographic standards as their original intention has been misunderstood from the very outset. Because modern readers are oblivious to the fact that the geographical, historical, and technical details of the Assyrian royal inscriptions are embedded in the original ideological chaîne opératoire that links them to the fulfillment of human and divine expectations, Assyrian ideology has been regarded as merely manipulative and propagandistic.66 I propose that these geographical, historical, and technical details should be read as the tools with which kings identified themselves as individuals acting at a particular moment in history. Although Assyrian kings as a type were bound to a particular set of roles, individual kings used the particular data of their reign to define and express their individuality and personhood. As demonstrated by Mario Liverani in his seminal article on the variants in Sennacherib’s epithets,67 this historicizing aspect was further apparent in the titulary of the kings, which underwent constant changes according to historical political situations. Variation, as Liverani stresses, was the result not only of historical change, but – depending on context – could be functional; as such, modern editions separating the historical section of inscriptions from their dedicatory section actually distort the broader picture.68 As already stated in Chapter Six, however, the plotline of royal inscriptions should be read primarily in light of their mythic underpinnings69 and as testimony to the fact that the relevant king had understood the mission of his office and dutifully fulfilled the obligations prescribed by it. Accordingly, royal inscriptions are ceremonial and celebratory in nature.70 Modern research should thus be concerned with investigating the variations within the plotline of a particular royal inscription or, when striving to reconstruct the historicity of certain events, with examining the historical details by comparison with information drawn from text genres connected to daily practice. In his examination of the Old Babylonian traditions regarding the Great Rebellion against Narām-Sîn, Steve Tinney likewise rejects the “separation of literary and historical texts on the basis of apparent veracity,” and concludes, like Liverani, that texts can only be read within their own context.71 This con

clusion restates an observation made by Piotr Michalowski in the 1980s: “the major corollary is the simple fact that the question of realism cannot be invoked in order to single out certain texts as historical, and therefore, somehow ‘real’ in opposition to those which one could, conceivably, label as ‘fictions.’ Texts are stories, or narratives, or whatever one may wish to call them, but there is no way in which any verbal artifact can be said to be ultimately more true than any other.”72 Michalowski’s assessment relies on the research of the historian Hayden White, whose examination of the relevance of literary theory to historical studies led him to contend that “it is sometimes said that the aim of the historian is to explain the past by ‘finding,’ ‘identifying’ or ‘uncovering’ the ‘stories’ that lie buried in chronicles; and that the difference between ‘history’ and ‘fiction’ resides in the fact that the historian ‘finds’ his stories, whereas the fiction writer ‘invents’ his. This conception of the historian’s task, however, obscures the extent to which ‘invention’ also plays a part in the historian’s operations. The same event can serve as a different kind of element of many different historical stories, depending on the role it is assigned in a specific motific characterization of the set to which it belongs.”73

8 Between the Fictive and the Imaginary
8.1 The Tropological Discourse of Royal Inscriptions
A correct understanding of Assyrian ideological expression requires recognition of its highly metaphorical language and the epistemic function of myth as laid out in Blumenberg’s monumental study Work on Myth.1 The combat myth as a model of and for reality2 underpins all regicentric literature, including the royal inscriptions; it was mediated through condensed icons such as that of the Assyrian royal seal and the Assyrian battle scenes in palatial reliefs; and it was staged in the performance of state rituals. Images of hunting and battle scenes, royal texts – be they epics, hymns, heroic poems, or royal inscriptions – and royal rituals all function as a kind of “phenotext”3 or “hypertext”4 of the original combat myth, which acts as a “charter myth,”5 “hypotext,”6 or “conceptual metaphor.”7 In the words of Walter Burkert: “a myth, qua tale, is not identical with any given text.”8 Myth should not be dismissed as an archaic mentality, but rather re-introduced as a pragmatic analytical category9 governing all media within Assyrian ideological discourse. Any literary royal text, image, or ritual must therefore be analyzed not only as a narrative in itself but also in its intertextual relationship with other cultural forms of expression and with “myth” as the “hypotext.” As formulated by Lakoff and Johnson, “the essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another.”10 According to the narratologist Tzvetan Todorov,11 the story-discourse distinction – the distinction between content and how the story is told – directs our attention to the level of presentation and to the arrangement and treatment of events, deep

The Tropological Discourse of Royal Inscriptions 291
ening our understanding of the particular plotline chosen in a given royal inscription. These plotlines involve the pacification of the world (= military account + hunting account) in order to demonstrate the king’s legitimacy and his merit, which permit him to restore or build the temples and to take care of the cult (= building account). Having acted successfully in both respects, the king is entitled to record his deeds in writing as a message to posterity and the gods (blessing and curse formulas). Mesopotamian royal inscriptions represent various truths and intentionalities, necessitating a multilayered reading. One level is represented by topographic, geographic, and onomastic references, as well as information about the itinerary of a given campaign and lists of booty, which can be credited with truthfulness in terms of event history. Assyrian royal inscriptions in particular are frequently characterized by detailed information regarding the geography, fauna, flora, and people of conquered regions. Together with the stylistic format of the report this interest in comprehensive description can be considered an example of what Wolfgang Iser calls the “concealment of fictionality,”12 i.e. the claim of the text to be an expression of reality. Such masking of reality is, as Iser suggests, itself a literary device. The relevant event history is, however, integrated into a narrative through emplotment according to the terms of the combat myth and through other literary and thought patterns. The emplotment of the narrative within the framework of the combat myth as represented by the Ninurta mythology constitutes the second level at which royal inscriptions should be read and carries an intentional truth, i.e. the ideological message of the king securing the civic and cosmic order.13 Tropological discourse in the royal inscriptions is not limited to the trope of the king as successful warrior and provider for the temple, but structures their narrative as a whole. Consequently, Assyrian historiography is more than a mere narrative of historical phenomena encompassing events, persons, processes, and institutions. Since the Ninurta mythology dominates the plot structure of royal inscriptions, Assyrian historiography should be read as a discourse in tropological terms with the combat myth as the central metaphor framing royal action. It is by means of their converging presentation in myth and historical inscription that events were endowed with meaning and truth.14 As stated by Hayden White, the notion of tropological discourse “strikes at the very conception of factuality, and especially at historians’ claims regarding the factual truthfulness not only of their statements about particular events but of their discourse
12 Iser 1993, 12. 13 For a similar analysis of the reading process see Liverani 1973, 181. 14 See White 1999, 10 ff. on tropological discourse.



292 Between the Fictive and the Imaginary
as a whole. If a factual statement is not only a singular existential proposition
cast in literal language but such a proposition plus the implied conventions
for determining what shall count as literal and what as figurative in that propo
sition, then such statements can no longer be taken at their face value.”15 Di
chotomies such as literal/figurative, fictional/factual, and referentional/inten
tional are consequently counterproductive in the reading of royal inscriptions,
the logic of which falls between these two extremes.
Such a reading further undermines the view that the Assyrian royal inscrip
tions were basically devoid of historiographical scope or that they served mere
ly propagandistic purposes as royal self-celebrations.16 In ideological terms,
the king’s access and loyalty to tradition identified him as the guarantor of the
cosmic order and as the legitimate occupant of the office of kingship.17 More
over, the king gained authority in the present by actively participating in the
cosmic order and reiterating cultural meaning by undertaking actions that be
fitted the royal office.18 His authority was primarily based on his adherence
to mythological paradigms and to his fictitious role as Ninurta. The Ninurta
mythology served as the most relevant backdrop for the construction of the
king’s individual image and for the plotline of the narrative of his deeds. Simul
taneously, by combining reality in the form of historical, technical, and geo
graphical details with the overall mythic plot, i.e. through the operation of
mythic “emplotment,”19 the king not only reactualized and reshaped the past
in light of the present, but also defined his individual legacy by presenting an
interpretation of his achievements that conformed to the mythic ideal of the
warrior king.
15 White 1999, 15. 16 Ibid. 17 See a similar discussion by Anderson 2009 on how the ancient Greeks related to their past. 18 In a similar vein Renger 2003 already emphasizes the literary quality of the Assyrian royal inscriptions of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE and their interconnectedness with the epic, mythical, and scholarly traditions, as is evident in their use of Standard Babylonian language, the coincidence of the written line and syntactic units, and the common use of rare vocabulary. Such a close connection to literary production is already apparent in the inscriptions of Hammurabi and Samsuiluna, for instance, which also feature elements of the Hymnic-Epical Dialect (HED), see Renger 1980‒83, 68 § 4). As discussed by Marcia Anne Dobres, this unfolding of the continuous process of becoming in technical production and in the establishment of cultural meaning was the concern of Mauss in his approach to technology, see Dobres 1999, 127, which can be applied with some modification to the chain of argument followed in Assyrian inscriptions. 19 White 1999.



The Tropological Discourse of Royal Inscriptions 293
The descriptive, historicizing aspect of Assyrian royal inscriptions described above appears in relation to military campaigns20 and eventually makes its way into the iconography of Assyrian steles. Through to the Sargonid period, Assyrian kings fulfilled certain conventions by presencing their achievements in the textual record: by demonstrating their successful performance of the actions associated with the combat myth, kings asserted that they had met the expectations that came with the royal office. The same approach is apparent in the visual medium of the royal stele. To name but a few examples, the pictorial representations of Aššurnaṣirpal II (883‒859 BCE), Shalmaneser III’s Kurkh Monolith (858‒824 BCE), Adad-nīrārī III’s (809‒782 BCE) stele from Tell Rimah, and Tiglath-Pileser III’s (744‒727 BCE) Iran Stele all follow the same paradigm. These steles depict the king in the gesture of prayer, communicating with the gods who are represented above him in the form of their symbols (fig. 50). With the exception of the king’s robe and his (optional) necklace,21 these steles are largely standardized and do not depict any features that suggest an individualized representation of history.22 In Esarhaddon’s Zinçirli and Til Barsip steles,23 by contrast, the king is depicted together with the crown prince Ashurbanipal and the governor of Babylon Šamaš-šum-ukīn in an uncharacteristic triumvirate that is specific to the particular historical circumstances of Esarhaddon’s reign (fig. 51). These steles also revive the image of Ištar holding the enemy by the nose-rope, which is known from the Anu-banini rock relief, but now it is Esarhaddon himself who assumes the role of the goddess in the iconography. Of further interest in these steles is the historically particular depiction of Esarhaddon’s enemies in their relationship with the Assyrian king: Zinçirli was an Assyrian vassal and Til Barsip was an important provincial center along the route toward the Mediterranean. While Til Barsip was at one point a center of Aramean resistance to Assyrian expansion, it was subsequently Assyrianized culturally. The depictions of Abdi-Milkutti, the Phoenician rebel whose revolt Esarhaddon suppressed in 677 BCE, and of the Egyptian king, who is recognizable by his Nubi
20 Zaccagnini 1982. 21 Reade 2005, 11. 22 This is not to say that the depiction of the king in communication cannot take on other forms; an outstanding example of this is Aššurnaṣirpal II’s (883‒859 BCE) relief in his Northwest Palace in Nimrud. Located behind the pedestal in his throne room, this relief depicts the king at the side of the sacred tree, communicating with Aššur in the winged disk. In contrast to the iconography of the steles, here the king is represented in his role as the steward of Aššur and the position of kingship is reserved for the god himself, see Winter 1983, 26 ff. and Pongratz-Leisten 2011b. 23 Porter 2003c.

an features, signal the “elimination of Egypt as Assyria’s last significant challenger for control of the west,”24 and were meant to remind the two cities of Zinçirli and Til Barsip that their western colleague had been defeated. Whereas in the Til Barsip stele the two enemy kings are represented almost as Assyrians and with a certain dignity, in the Zinçirli stele in Samʾal they are depicted in the style of Samʾalian princes, approximating the local ethnic identity of the vassal in that region. Additionally, the enemy kings are much smaller than their Assyrian counterpart, and their “heads are thrown back so that they appear to look beseechingly at the face of the impervious Assyrian king. In an ironic twist, the scribe who laid out the text left large spaces in this line so that

the word ‘Aššur’ is incised neatly on the upturned pointed beard of the Phoenician captive, as if labeling him as Assyrian property.”25
8.2 The Dual-Focus Pattern of the Assyrian Epic
Although it is informed by the Ninurta mythology, and although it shares with the royal inscriptions the historical framework of a campaign that actually happened including the historical figures of the Assyrian and Babylonian kings, the Assyrian royal epic – in contrast to the royal inscriptions – is never dominated solely by the emplotment of the combat myth. As is apparent in the Middle Assyrian royal epics of Adad-nīrārī I and Tukultī-Ninurta I, the topos of the king’s normative behavior in his dealings with the gods served other important plotlines as well. One of these is the Assyrian king’s adherence to the stipulations of treaties concluded under the surveillance of the gods, which the enemy king is said to transgress. The implications of the treaty motif were negotiated in myth before this motif made its way into Assyrian epic literature. In one section, the Etana Myth attests to the central role of Šamaš as witness to the swearing of oaths. This passage is preserved in full only in the NeoAssyrian version of the Etana Myth, but fragments of the Old Babylonian and Middle Assyrian versions attest to the fact that it formed part of much earlier cultural discourse. The late version reads as follows:
[The serpent] made ready to speak, [saying to the eagle], “[If indeed?] ... of friendship and [ ] “[Then? Let us swear a] mighty [oath of Šamaš], “A villainy of the gods, [an abomination you have committed], “Come then, let us set forth [ ],26 “Let us swear [an oath] by the netherworld.” Before Šamaš the warrior they swo[re] the oath, “Whoever transgresses] the limits of Šamaš [ ], “May Šamaš [deliver him] as an offender into the hands of the executioner, “Whoever [transgresses] the limits of Šamaš, “May the [mountains] remove [their pas]ses far away from him, “May the oncoming weapon [make straight for him], “May the trap and curse of Šamaš overthrow him [and hunt him down]!”27
25 Porter 2003c, 75 f. 26 Foster 2005, 545 reconstructs “Come then, let us set forth [and go up a high mountain];” I think, however, that the focus remains on the taking of the oath. Wilson 1985, l. 14 translates: “Come, let us indemnify ourselves [ ],” a meaning that is otherwise not attested for zaqāpu. AHw III, 1513, s.v.zaqāpu N translates “(lass uns) zum Aufbruch (aufrichten).” 27 Foster 2005, 545 and Novotny 2001, 17.



The Dual-Focus Pattern of the Assyrian Epic 297
The treaty motif as negotiated in myth is the major theme of the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic. It dominates not only Tukultī-Ninurta’s account of his dealings with the Babylonian king, but also determines the different relationships between the Assyrian and Babylonian kings and their respective gods. Tukultī-Ninurta is depicted as the beneficiary of divine support on account of his conscientious conformance to the terms of the treaty sworn before Šamaš and the gods, whereas the Babylonian king’s betrayal of the emblem of Šamaš arouses the anger of his gods, who subsequently abandon him. With its dual-focus pattern,28 the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic is one of the few texts that elaborates on the behavior of both the king and his opponent, providing us with an idea of what the enemy’s treacherous behavior implied in the Assyrian weltanschauung. The contrastive description of the Assyrian and Babylonian kings also plays out in their divergent approaches to armed confrontation. Tukultī-Ninurta I does not go to war with Kaštiliaš IV until he sends him a formal declaration of intent based on the stipulations of the treaty. This stands in stark contrast with Kaštiliaš IV’s unannounced provocations against Assyria, and Machinist notes that “in the declaration, the Assyrian documents his charge that Kaštiliaš has violated their treaty, and then proclaims that he is reading out the tablet of the original agreement to the divine overseer of such matters, Šamaš. The god’s verdict he concludes, will emerge from an ordeal of battle between the treaty partners, in which the winner will be the one who remained faithful to the treaty.”29 The turning point in the narrative, as Machinist recognizes, is the Assyrian king’s declaration and accusation, which later comes to represent the summary statement legitimizing the king’s military actions in the royal inscriptions. With its emphasis on the contractual relationship between the two kings on the basis of a treaty witnessed by the gods, the Middle Assyrian epic articulates for the first time the rhetoric that determines the king’s justification for going to war in much later royal inscriptions. The behavior of the opponent is characterized by notions of “crime, sin” (gillatu), “trickiness, evil” (pašuqtu), and “offense, act of malice, sin” (šērtu).30 In the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, the literary themes or topoi concerning the justification of battle and the behavioral patterns of the good (Assyrian) and bad (Babylonian) king – including the treaty-motif – are developed at length and in highly literary language. This literary language is replete with rare words and indicates that the text is the product of a learned scholar steeped in both

298 Between the Fictive and the Imaginary
Babylonian and Assyrian tradition. Although these metaphors and literary topoi also inform royal inscriptions, they feature only as abbreviations in a condensed and perfunctory fashion. Indeed, when describing the Assyrian king’s motivation for embarking on military campaigns the enemy king’s treacherous behavior is sometimes condensed in the simplified motif of the lie (sarru, sarāru),31 which omits any description of the specifics regarding a given enemy’s violation of a treaty. Moreover, in contrast to the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic royal inscriptions are single-focused, centering on the action of the Assyrian king without accounting for the thought processes of enemies and assigning them a passive and often even anonymous role. In this presentation, the enemy king’s transgression was ultimately considered a sin against the gods. The dual-focus pattern elaborated in such detail in the Middle Assyrian Tukultī-Ninurta Epic reappears to some degree in the royal inscriptions of the Sargonid period – particularly in Sargon II’s highly literary account of his Eighth Campaign. In this account, the Assyrian king credits his adversary, king Rusa of Urartu, with observing the unwritten but still effective rules regulating the behavior of adversary kings of equal status in times of war. Sargon II mentions that Rusa had sent him a formal message asking him to engage in battle, but then proceeds to meditate at length about his own pious and correct observance of diplomatic agreements, raising our suspicions as to the veracity of his account:32
Sargon II’s Eighth Campaign 110‒12533
110 he felt himself eager to contest with me on the battlefield, and, preparing remorselessly a strategy for the destruction of the army of Enlil and Aššur, 111 he drew up a battle line at all the mountain regions and sent me a messenger (with a challenge) to attack and to mingle in battle. 112 I, Sargon, king of the four corners, shepherd of the land of Aššur, who observes the solemn oath of Enlil and Marduk, who heeds the judgment of Šamaš 113 seed of Aššur, of the city of knowledge and broad understanding, who attends reverently the commands of the great gods and does not approach/transgress their designs, 114 that legitimate king who speaks only propitious words, to whom treachery is a taboo, whose mouth utters nothing wicked or destructive, 115 the wisest ruler in the universe, who had been created with intellectual capacity and intelligence in decision-making, who holds in his hands the reverence of the gods and goddesses,
31 Pongratz-Leisten 2002. 32 Note that Oppenheim 1960, 137‒139 prefers to interpret the enemy king’s behavior as a cultural trait alien to Assyrian war practice. 33 My translation attempts to be more literal in some parts than that of Foster 2005, 797 f.



The Dual-Focus Pattern of the Assyrian Epic 299
116 to Aššur, king of all the great gods, lord of the lands, begetter of the “Mighty One,”34 king of all the great gods, who keeps in check the four corners of the world, 117 almighty lord of Aššur, who in the prodigious fury of his wrath grinds up the sovereigns of the entire world and crushes their bodies, 118 that sublime warrior from whom whose battle snare the evil-doer has no escape, who demolishes anyone who has not revered an oath to him, 119 (120) who charges furiously in the clash of battle, (119) against anyone who has not revered his name, or anyone who has trusted in his strength alone, or anyone who has forgotten the greatness of his divinity, or anyone who boasts vaingloriously, 120 shattering his weapons and evaporating his formations into the winds, 121 (however), the one who observes the verdict (šipṭi) of the gods and trusts in the favorable judgment (ana damqi dēn dUTU) of Šamaš and reveres the divinity of Aššur, Enlil of the gods, 122 he (Aššur) makes his fierce axes go at his side and establishes him in victory over his enemies and foes; 123 because, indeed, I had never transgressed the boundaries of Rusa the Urartian (that delimit) the frontiers of his extensive territory, nor had I shed the blood of his warriors, 124 I raised my hands (in prayer) that in the midst of battle, he (Aššur) bring about his downfall, that the aggressiveness of his mouth may turn against him and make him bear his punishment. 125 Aššur, my lord, heard my just discourse (atmāya ša mīšari), it pleased him. He turned favorably to my petition for cosmic order (kittu) and granted my prayer.
After laying out in detail his correct behavior, at the end of this passage Sargon II links himself to the notion of cosmic order (kittu) in order to present himself as a model of the ideal king.35 The dual-focus pattern of Sargon II’s Eight Campaign is also characteristic of Esarhaddon’s Apology, which is discussed in Chapter Nine, though in that text the contenders for the throne are not explicitly named and the nature of their misdeeds (epšētišunu lemnēti) remains undefined. Despite swearing an oath of loyalty to Esarhaddon, the contenders for the throne are said to have schemed evil (ikappudū lemuttu I 25; ikpudū lemuttu I 42).
These examples from the Middle Assyrian and Sargonid periods substantiate the view that irrespective of their dual- or single-focus pattern, the intentionality of both royal epics and royal inscriptions was to promote the image of the Assyrian king as acting in accordance with the rules and norms of international diplomacy and warfare.

300 Between the Fictive and the Imaginary
8.3 The Fictive and the Imaginary: Myth versus Legend and Royal Inscriptions
Despite the presence of Assyrianisms, like myth, legends, and historical-literary texts, royal inscriptions were written in the literary Standard Babylonian dialect, a choice that is essential to their categorization. From the point of view of the text producers, therefore, these various text categories – however distinct their plotlines – were considered to belong to one large group that we might call literary texts. Additionally, these text categories are characterized by fictionalizing acts of selection, combination, and self-disclosure intimating the “as-if” world, and are all based on intentionality.36 In all genres the denotative function is, to various extents, “made subservient to the figurative one,” and “the dual nature of the presented world moves into focus: it is concrete enough to be perceived as a world and, simultaneously, figures as an analogue exemplifying, through a concrete specimen, what is to be conceived.”37 In all genres the relation between fact and fiction is redefined and factuality becomes a matter of “descriptive protocols.”38 Accordingly, the notion of authenticity introduced by A. K. Grayson as a method for distinguishing between royal inscriptions and historical-literary texts on the basis that the former were composed at the king’s command while the latter were written at the initiative of the scribes39 is not useful – particularly because the texts can reveal the same fundamental emplotment, which might be enriched by other plotlines in line with their genre, and because all these genres are linked intertextually and were the products of the same scribal circles. Nonetheless, while fictionality in terms of Hayden White’s literary theory applies to any of the texts under scrutiny, the genres of myth, royal epic, and royal inscriptions still differ in their conception of factuality. Although royal inscriptions, royal imagery, and state ritual are governed by the combat myth as “charter myth,” and might use similar narrative techniques, they retain their distinctiveness vis-à-vis mythological, legendary, and poetic literature, which equally revolve around the figure of the warrior king. In this context, Iser’s notion of the imaginary as the third element in a triad with the real and the fictive constitutes a productive conceptual framework, as
36 For fictionalizing acts in constructing a represented world see Iser 1993, 1‒21. 37 Iser 1993, 15. 38 White 1999, 18 39 Grayson 1975a, 2b and 1975b, 7 n. 9. Haul’s recent distinction between authentic, feigned (“fingiert”), and fictive texts does not persuade, Haul 2009, 133‒135, as it presupposes the notion of faking, a notion that seems inappropriate in defining the intentionality of the ancient texts.



The Fictive and the Imaginary: Myth versus Legend and Royal Inscriptions 301
it allows the maintenance of the notion of fictionality for all text genres.40 Although Iser’s discussion is not concerned with historiography and focuses exclusively on literature, his notion of the imaginary can inform our distinction between the two in a modified way. The fictive transformation of reality through an “as-if” construction applies to all our genres, but it is the transgression of the borders of what is familiar – the experience of the imaginary as described in myth dealing with imaginary events and imaginary actors – that distinguishes legendary and mythic texts from royal inscriptions and historical epic. Textual elements that index the ‘impossible’ or the ‘unreal’ stimulate affective reactions in the reader and thus distinguish the legendary and mythic texts from royal inscriptions and historical epics, in which the primary referents are tied to reality. In the Cuthean Legend, the enemy has a partridge body and raven face and is suckled by the primordial goddess Tiāmat.41 Such elements exceed the boundaries of experience and trigger an imaginative reaction that creates an imaginary world in the reader’s mind, constituting an analogue to the representation of the enemy both in reality and in the fictive royal inscriptions. The transgression of the borders of what is familiar in literary texts discloses their “as-if” character even when the referents in a given myth or legend are “historical” kings or events. As such, despite the fact that NarāmSîn was a real figure, the Cuthean Legend’s self-disclosure as fictive lets its readers know how it should be read. Applying the insights of literary theory as developed by Hayden White and Wolfgang Iser to our texts thus provides us with a framework that allows us to categorize the fictitious as bound to emplotment and the imaginary which draws on myth as bound to the experience of the counter-intuitive. Literary texts other than royal inscriptions are, moreover, much richer in their choice of various topoi and themes. The Cuthean Legend refers explicitly to the written text as a medium for transmitting the king’s personal experience and knowledge to posterity, a topos that also appears in the Gilgameš Epic. The “Open the Tablet-Box” theme, i.e. leaving behind a written text as a monument to future rulers, frames the narrative of the Cuthean Legend in its beginning and end; at the text’s conclusion, scholars are identified as the agents in the process of transmission. This framework is embellished by the introduction of a second account concerning a legendary predecessor, the king Enmerkar, who is criticized for failing to record his experiences for posterity and thus functions to demonstrate the importance of leaving behind written testimony to Narām

302 Between the Fictive and the Imaginary
Sîn. The account of Narām-Sîn’s own experiences then forms the third and central layer of the narrative. Moreover, the Cuthean Legend and the Curse of Akkad, for instance, introduce the notion of royal failure due to disrespect of the gods, a theme conspicuously absent from the royal inscriptions. Another plotline related to the king’s relationship with the gods concerns his observance or disregard of omens. In the Cuthean Legend, the king’s obedience to the will of the gods as expressed through omens determines his success and the welfare of both his reign and his country. Interestingly, the performance of extispicy before a military campaign also occurs in the Middle Assyrian poem The Hunter (discussed in Chapter Six), and only appears in the rhetoric of the royal inscriptions in the much later Sargonid period. It should further be noted that in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, it is the enemy king Kaštiliaš IV to whom his own gods refuse to give favorable omens. Further, legends, historical-literary texts, and poems can deal with maltreatment of temples, a behavior that elicits divine wrath. This theme is negotiated in the Sumerian poem of the Curse of Akkad42 and in the much later Babylonian Nabû-šuma-iškun Epic.43 At particular moments in history, myth and royal hymns introduce new tropes of the king as culture hero, as is the case in the Sumerian composition Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, which attributes the invention of writing to King Enmerkar of Uruk.44 Royal hymns from the Ur III period through to the Isin-Larsa period sometimes praise the king for being conversant in various languages, for possessing all kinds of skills, and for being expert in the traditional body of scholarly knowledge, a trope that appears in the literary text Sin of Sargon, which was composed under
42 Cooper 1983b. 43 Cole 1994. 44 “His speech was substantial, and its contents extensive. The messenger, whose mouth was heavy, was not able to repeat it. Because the messenger, whose mouth was tired, was not able to repeat it, the lord of Kulaba patted some clay and wrote the message as if on a tablet. Formerly, the writing of messages on clay was not established. Now, under that sun and on that day, it was indeed so. The lord of Kulaba inscribed the message like a tablet. It was just like that. The messenger was like a bird, flapping its wings; he raged forth like a wolf following a kid. He traversed five mountains, six mountains, seven mountains. He lifted his eyes as he approached Aratta. He stepped joyfully into the courtyard of Aratta, he made known the authority of his king. Openly he spoke out the words in his heart. The messenger transmitted the message to the lord of Aratta.” Quoted after ETCSL t.1.8.2.3; see also Vanstiphout 2003. Note that in contrast to the legendary kings Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh, Enmerkar was neither deified nor venerated. Old Babylonian tradition classified him under ill-famed kings because he had allegedly not written down his experiences on a stele to be read by a future ruler, see Westenholz 1997, 264 and Selz 2008. My thanks to Gebhard Selz who allowed me to read his unpublished manuscript.

Esarhaddon, and then surfaces in the royal inscriptions of Ashurbanipal (668631/27? BCE) and much later in those of Nabonidus (555‒539 BCE). The introduction in Sargonid royal inscriptions of the motif comparing the king to the antediluvian sage Adapa can be considered a revival of the trope of the king as culture hero, and is reflective of the process whereby epic or mythic literature articulated particular motifs before they found their way into the commemorative inscriptions. In some instances, myth explores the psychological experience of a hero, “progressively and deliberately achieving a portrait that is unique and nontransferable.”45 Myth can also reverse the sequential chain of gestures, as is the case in the first millennium version of the Gilgameš Epic. Whereas the Old Babylonian Gilgameš Epic praises Gilgameš as warrior, the first millennium version extols him on account of his extraordinary experiences. Further, the first millennium Gilgameš Epic invokes the trope that it is the king’s duty to inform future generations of his experiences in written form and then, without referencing Gilgameš’s military achievements, praises him as the builder of Uruk’s city wall:
He built the wall of Uruk-the-Sheepfold, Of holy Eanna, the pure storehouse. See its wall which is like a strand of wool, view its parapet which nobody can replicate! Take the stairway that has been there since ancient times, And draw near to Eanna, the seat of Ištar, that no later king can replicate, nor any man. Go up on to the wall of Uruk and walk around, survey the foundation platform, inspect the brickwork! (See) if its brickwork is not kiln-fired brick, and if the Seven Sages did not lay its foundations! [One šār is] city, [one šār] date-grove, one šār is clay-pit, half a šār the temple of Ištar: [three šār] and a half (is) Uruk, (its) measurement.46
As discussed in Chapter Four, the Sumero-Babylonian-Assyrian weltanschauung assigned agency for the foundation of cities to the gods in mythic times. Curiously, in the Gilgameš Epic the city plan of Uruk is in principle attributed to Gilgameš, even though mythical ancestry in the guise of the Seven Sages is claimed for the sacred precinct of Inanna’s temple and its staircase. Gilgameš is clearly envisioned as the legendary model king, and he is grouped with the Seven Sages and distinguished from later kings. The Gilgameš Epic thus follows
45 Sasson 2005, 230. 46 George 2003, 538‒539 i 11‒23.



304 Between the Fictive and the Imaginary
the cultural tradition expressed in the Sumerian King List, which credits Gilgameš with a 125 year reign and counts him among the legendary kings.47 Associating the king with the Seven Sages is a literary device that reappears during the reigns of Sennacherib and his successors, who compare themselves to the sage Adapa.48 In contrast to the narrative logic of the royal inscriptions, however, the plotline of myth can proceed with acts that might be unmotivated or unreasonable in themselves, provided that they are “effective in setting up the explanation of the ensuing acts. The characters accomplish (or undergo) without any surprise the most improbable and strange things, which are impossible to predict or justify. But there is a coherent line that runs throughout the narrative and culminates at its conclusion.”49 While some of the various motifs described above appear in royal inscriptions along with their plotlines, they never determine the character and structure of the overall narrative in the way that the emplotment of the combat myth does. Further, Assyrian epic literature sometimes includes other literary forms such as the royal praise or the penitential psalm, as is the case in the TukultīNinurta Epic. These literary forms only appear again in late Sargonid royal inscriptions like those of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal,50 when the distinction between royal inscriptions and mythic narratives became ever more blurred. Accordingly, the distinction between royal inscriptions, epics, and legends can be described in terms of the different use of or weight assigned to particular tropes and plotlines, i.e. the different relationships between historical interpretation and literary representation. Or, to apply the categories developed by the historian Jörn Rüsen, “retrospectivity, perspectivity, selectivity, and particularity,”51 can be weighted differently in different narratives. Rüsen’s categories embrace the following concepts: the approach to empirical facts determined by projections into the future (retrospectivity), the relationship between past and present determined by the author’s standing in a particular social
47 ETCSL 2.2.1 112‒115. 48 This grouping of the kings with Adapa is typical of the Sargonid period and could constitute further evidence in favor of the redaction of the 12 tablet version of the Gilgamesh Epic in the Sargonid period, as originally suggested by Frahm 1999 for other reasons. 49 Liverani 2004, 6. 50 In his discussion of epic as genre Richard Martin 2005 suggests a communicative approach to epic instead of a formal definition based on content or style, as epic can “interact with and incorporate all these forms” – myth, folktale, wisdom proverbs, and praise poetry, see also Gilan 2010, 51. 51 Rüsen 2005, 66. Note that Rüsen still argues in favor of the historian’s objectivity despite the fact that all of these aspects speak against the notion of objectivity.



The Dynamics of Literary Textual Production and Assyrian Royal Discourse 305
context at a particular historical moment (perspectivity), the norms and values determining the selection of facts (selectivity), and the way historical knowledge is related to identity building through historical memory (particularity). Annals and epics were both produced to justify real-life events and to magnify their historical importance.52 Both utilized structures of meaning-production that were ultimately aimed at preserving and disseminating the fame of the king, making use of the past in order to anchor the king in a continuum of space and time.
8.4 The Dynamics of Literary Textual Production and Assyrian Royal Discourse
The preceding discussion of the commonalities and discrepancies between royal inscriptions and other literary texts relevant to the emergence of Assyrian cultural discourse reveals the following development: in Pre-Sargonic Lagaš and during the following Akkad period, the narrative of the royal inscriptions focused primarily on the martial role of the king. During the process of literary re-invention that took place in the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian kings Sargon and Narām-Sîn emerged as the charismatic protagonists of legends that described their forays into and conquests of far distant regions; additionally, these two kings developed into paradigms for a discourse in which the figure of the king functioned as a model of human experience. It is this context that produced great legends and myths like the Cuthean Legend, King of Battle, the Gilgameš Epic, the Etana Myth, and the Akkadian Anzû Myth. Enūma eliš and the Erra Epic can be considered the climax of those literary works that negotiate the notion of leadership and the justification of warfare. From the Middle Assyrian period onward, then, the Old Babylonian legends along with the Anzû Myth, the Etana Myth and the Gilgameš Epic provided the effective background and model for the behavior of individual kings in royal literature, which includes royal hymns, royal epics, and royal inscriptions. In an expression of a creative and imaginative Assyrian adaptation of the longstanding Sumero-Babylonian repertoire of tropes centered on the institution of kingship, Assyrian royal inscriptions integrate these tropes into their coherent narrative, whose plotline complements the combat myth and hunter poems with the trope of the king as legitimate builder, restorer, and provider

of the temple. The ideological emphasis in royal inscriptions is clearly on the king’s heroic and conscientious performance of his duties on behalf of the god Aššur. Written on tablets buried in foundation deposits and on the reliefs displayed on temple walls, royal inscriptions function as performative devices along with imagery – that aim to persuade posterity and the divine audience of the king’s successful tenure of his office.
8.5 Making an Argument: The Intertextuality of Sennacherib’s Account of the Battle of Halule
I close my discussion with some final remarks on myth as an analytical category and its intertextuality with royal inscriptions. Myth as a referential system functioned in two ways in the cultural discourse of Mesopotamia. First, myth could act as the hidden text or matrix53 that informed royal inscriptions and royal rituals without necessarily representing a definitive and canonized pretext. Although myth informed the general narrative of royal ideological discourse, myth as tropological discourse was condensed, reworked, and re-actualized in the historical image, text, and ritual – thus fulfilling a structural and descriptive model function.54 These aspects have been discussed throughout this book. Second, myth – or rather the act of mythologizing – can be regarded as an erudite literary practice in the production of historical inscriptions. In this case, the intertextuality between myth and historical inscriptions works through direct literary allusions or quotations.55 As the preserve of high culture, such literary allusions reveal not only the pervasiveness of myth in the cultural discourse, situating it in an intertextual space, but also reflect the voice of the scholar as the invisible agent who fashions the royal narrative centering on the king’s body politic. In literary theory any text is regarded as being situated in a web of other signifying systems56 and is therefore the product of cultural discourse.57 Thus for Roland Barthes each text is a “chambre

d’échos”58 that extends the notion of intertextuality into intermediality: “l’intertexte n’est pas forcément en champs d’influences; c’est plutôt une musique de figures, de metaphors, de pensées-mots; c’est le significant comme sirène.”59 For Riffattere, the “very idea of textuality” is “inseparable from and founded upon intertextuality.”60 In Assyria, however, not every royal inscription exhibits the same level of enmeshedness with other texts. According to Manfred Pfister61 and Harold Bloom,62 intertextuality only becomes a meaningful approach in the interpretation of texts if the global concept of the intertext is limited to intertextuality as a specific characteristic of literariness and poeticity. What, then, was intertextuality intended to accomplish and what can be inferred about the native understanding of intertextuality? To my understanding, a high degree of literary intertextuality is to be considered not only a particular manifestation of erudition, but also a manifestation of meaning-production and intentionality, and as such a resource for decoding the message of the text. Accordingly, intertextuality deserves a more detailed analysis. The account of the battle of Halule recorded in Sennacherib’s Chicago Prism,63 for instance, is exceptional in the richness of its literary allusions. This account is written in a highly poetic language and arguably “constitutes one of the finest pieces of Assyrian royal literature.”64 The text’s first editor, Daniel D. Luckenbill,65 noted its stylistic affinities with the Babylonian creation epic Enūma Eliš as early as 1924. More recently, Elnathan Weissert has suggested that through the literary allusions integrated into the account of the battle of Halule, “Sennacherib’s scribe consciously referred to [Enūma Eliš] in order to enhance his anti-Babylonian propaganda.”66 Weissert also argues that when the account of the battle of Halule was written, namely in 691 BCE, “Sennacherib’s plan to besiege and destroy Babylon, loot Esagila and take Marduk into captivity must have already been conceived.”67 Hayim Tadmor follows Weissert’s understanding of the text.68

308 Between the Fictive and the Imaginary
Although it is tempting to imagine such a scenario, the Babylonian Chronicle records an altogether different account of the battle of Halule in which the Assyrian army is forced to retreat.69 It is difficult to reconcile this evidence with the notion that Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule served to justify a future sack of Babylon. Moreover, Sennacherib’s account of the battle is replete with literary allusions to and intertextual links with texts other than Enūma Eliš, including the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, the Middle Assyrian poems LKA 62 and 63, the Erra Epic, and the highly literary account of Sargon II’s Eighth Campaign. Erudite literary intertextuality of this kind is extremely rare in Assyrian royal inscriptions and points to the author’s extensive command of literary tradition and to his singular capacity for combining elements drawn from myth, historical epic, and royal inscription in order to present a particular interpretation of historical events in conformity with cultural expectations and tradition: in other words, to produce an argument. Broad interrelatedness between these texts is not merely a display of erudition, but a means of invoking an extensive cultural tradition in order to frame and substantiate the concept of good (Assyrian) and bad (enemy) kingship. This framework in turn acts to sanction Sennacherib’s particularly brutal treatment of his Babylonian and Elamite adversaries. With the exception of Sargon II’s Eighth Campaign and Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule, the dual-focus pattern that typecasts the Assyrian and enemy kings as good and bad antagonists respectively is typical only of Assyrian epic literature and is especially prominent in the Tukultī-Ninurta-Epic.70 Royal inscriptions, by contrast, generally present a passive and anonymous image of the enemy. Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule describes his interaction with the rebellious Babylonians following the abduction and murder of his son Aššur-nādin-šumi, who had been the governor of Babylon. The account articulates several aspects related to the ancient notion of the bad king and defines actions that were considered taboo or divinely prohibited. It is the particular combination and literary presentation of these aspects and actions that constitutes a clear casus belli and justifies the Assyrian king’s military campaign. The following points are addressed by the author of Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule: 1. The illegitimate kingship of the Chaldean Mušēzib-Marduk, who rebelled against Sennacherib, fled into the marshes, sought the support of the Elamites, and was at some point restored to the Babylonian throne. Antagonism between the Babylonian and Assyrian kings is not, however, limited
69 Grayson 1975, Babylonian Chronicle 1 iii 16‒18. 70 See Chapter 7.5.



The Intertextuality of Sennacherib’s Account of the Battle of Halule 309
to their personal disagreements. To account for the extensive resistance with which Sennacherib was confronted in Babylon, the narrative shifts from the person of the Babylonian king to the people of Babylon themselves. The citizens of Babylon are said to collectively lock the city gates against the Assyrian king and are compared to the host of horrible creatures (gallê lemnūti, Chic. Pr. v 18) created by Tiāmat in her battle against Marduk. This allusion, evoking the notion of disorder and confusion described at length in Enūma Eliš, functions as a synecdoche for the entire pretext and determines the meaning of the new text.71 Further, the illegitimacy of the Chaldean king is expressed in a way that alludes directly to Tiāmat’s appointment of the unworthy Qingu as leader of her terrifying army of monsters, thus creating an alternative line of kingship to that which produced Marduk (En. el. iv 82). This intense dramatization of the antagonism between the Assyrian king and the Babylonians not only serves to demonize the latter, but also provides the explanatory pattern for the Assyrian king’s subsequent actions, establishing a clear chaîne opératoire that is illustrated by the following passage from Enūma Eliš: En. el. IV 115‒18 As for the eleven creatures, the ones adorned with an aura of terror, And the horde of the gallû-demons, which all went at her side supporting her, He put on lead ropes, he bound their arms. He trampled them under, together with their belligerence. 2. The poor moral character of the Babylonians as a community is reflected by their misappropriation of the treasure of Marduk’s temple Esagila and their use of divine property to bribe the king of Elam to assist them (Chic. Pr. v 31‒37a). Since in the Mesopotamian weltanschauung morality is communal rather than individual and because the king was responsible for the maintenance of civic order in his capacity as mediator between the divine and human realms,72 these acts highlight both the immorality of the Babylonian community and the failure – and consequent illegitimacy – of the Babylonian king. 3. The account of the battle of Halule includes a description of both the initial planning stage and of the actual military encounter itself. It is in this passage that most of the intertextual relationships with other mythical and historical-epic texts can be observed. The furious attack of the Babylonian and Elamite enemy hordes is described in naturalistic metaphors as an attack of locusts (see the reference to Sargon II’s Eight Campaign below)
71 Pfister 1985, 28‒29. 72 Pongratz-Leisten 2013a.

and the cloud of a terrible storm. The author builds tension by relating that the enemy forces cut Sennacherib off from all water sources and sharpened their weapons in anticipation of slaughter. The introduction of the latter motif – already used in Middle Assyrian heroic poems and royal inscriptions (see below) – prompts Sennacherib to plan his counter-attack. Rather than describing his attack as his own initiative, however, Senncherib is said to turn to the gods in prayer, who then come to his aid. The icon of the attacking king follows, rampaging like a wild lion, clothed in armor and wearing a helmet, holding the weapon of Aššur in his hand, and driving his war chariot through the blood and gore of his fallen enemies. The numerous intertextual references that characterize this passage are laid out below.
Intertextuality in Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule transcends the combat myth, as the tropological discourse that generates the gist of the narrative is also apparent in Middle Assyrian heroic poems and royal inscriptions. Although myth does operate as the text’s referential system of thought and pattern of explanation, its intertextual ties to multiple other texts is evident on various levels in an even more concrete way and can be identified on the basis of the four criteria below: 1. while some of these texts include Assyrianisms, they are all written in the Standard Babylonian literary dialect; 2. an intertextual link can consist of direct quotation, allusion, and the choice of the same rare word in combination with the use of vocabulary exclusive to literary texts; 3. the use of the same metaphor or literary figure of speech to describe a particular situation; 4. the use of the same phraseology.
On the basis of these four points, intertextuality excludes stock phrases and idiomatic expressions common in the Akkadian language. Any other intertextual reference, however, creates concise word-pictures that not only condense and crystallize the meaning of certain passages but also place a “constraint upon reading,” i.e. they compel a particular reading of the text.73 Finally, intertextuality can function to authorize texts, as is the case in the newly reformulated text of Sennacherib.74 Intertextuality as an interpretation of historical events thus represents a coherent strategy that links the new text with previous texts

that have already defined certain cultural norms and expectations. In the case of Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule, these norms and expectations concern the office of kingship and the role of the warrior king. Enūma Eliš is the key text informing Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule, as Sennacherib’s effort to reestablish terrestrial order is portrayed as analogous to Marduk’s re-establishment of cosmic order in Enūma Eliš – while Sennacherib’s enemies are likened to those of Marduk, namely Tiāmat and her horde of monsters led by Qingu. As stated above, intertextual references to other epics and myths are numerous in Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule (especially with regard to the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic, LKA 62, LKA 63, and the Erra Epic). These references are compiled below, but I cannot claim to have covered them all given that the full scope of such learned intertextuality certainly eludes the modern reader. 1. The description of the rebellious inhabitants of Babylon as “wicked demons” (gallê lemnūti), which identifies them with the host aiding Tiāmat in Enūma Eliš a. Chic. Pr. v 18‒19: māri Bābili gallê lemnūti abullī āli uddilū “... and the citizens of Babylon, wicked gallû-demons, had locked the city gates.” b. En. el. IV 116‒117: milla gallê ālikū kalû imniša ittadi ṣerrēti idīšunu ukassi “He put nose-ropes on the host of gallû-demons, all of which will walk to her right; he tied their arms.” c. Gallû demons appear three times in the Erra Epic, namely when the Sebetti call Erra to arms: gallû lišmûma ina ramā[nišunu lilli]kū “the gallû-demons may hear it and turn away (Erra I 67);” when Marduk describes the disintegration of heaven and earth that will ensue if he vacates the throne (Erra I 175); and when Erra promises Marduk that he will ensure the gallû demons remain in the netherworld (Erra I 185). 2. When Sennacherib’s enemies engage in battle, they are characterized as ones whose bodies are seized by alû-demons. As a consequence the sheikhs of Chaldea trample (udaʾʾišū) the bodies of their own soldiers instead of those of the enemy as they flee for their lives. To intensify the image of utter disarray they are said to lose control over their bodily functions.
a. Chic. Pr. vi 24‒35: šū mdUmman-menanu šar Elamti adi šar Bābili lúnasīkkāni ša Kaldi ālikūt idīšu hurbāšu tāhāziya kīma alê zumuršun ishup zarātešun umaššerūma ana šuzūb napšātišunu pagrī ummānātišunu udaʾʾišū ētiqū kī ša atmi summati kuššudi itarrakū libbūšun šinātēšun uṣarrapū qereb narkabātišunu umaššerūni zûšun ana radādišunu narkabāt sīsîya umaʾʾer arkīšun munnaribšunu ana napšāte ūṣû ašar ikaššadū urasabū ina kakki. “(As for) him, Umman-menanu (Humban-mena

nu), the king of the land Elam, along with the king of Babylon (and) the sheikhs of Chaldea who marched at his side, terror of doing battle with me overwhelmed them like alû-demons. They abandoned their tents and, in order to save their lives, they trampled the corpses of their troops as they pushed on. Their hearts throbbed like the pursued young of pigeons, they passed their urine hotly, (and) released their excrement inside their chariots. I ordered my chariots (and) horses to pursue them. Wherever they caught (them), they killed with the sword the runaways amongst them, who had fled for (their) lives.” b. In a fragmentary passage of the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic the utterance of the Assyrian king paralyzes Kaštiliaš’s body like the presence of an alû-demon: TKN “iii” [= A obv.] 24: [...] šarri danni kīma alê zumuršu iksi.
3. In Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule in the Chicago Prism the adverbial phrase ana lā simātišu is employed for the first time in Assyrian royal inscriptions and thus serves as an excellent reference-marker.75 The phrase appears in the context of illegitimate or unworthy enthronement and follows the description of the Babylonian king as an unworthy weakling, as the Babylonians are said “to have seated him on the throne, inappropriate for him (Chic. Pr. v 28‒30).” This alludes to Marduk’s accusation that Tiāmat inappropriately appointed Qingu as ruler over the gods and aligns the Babylonian king Mušēzib-Marduk/Šūzubu with Qingu as a leader of the forces of chaos.
a. Chic. Pr. v 28‒30: Bābilāya ana lā simātišu ina kussî ušēšibūšu bēlūt māt Šumeri u māt Akkadî ušadgilū pānišu “The Babylonians placed him on the throne, inappropriate for him, and entrusted him with the rulership over Sumer and Babylon.”
b. En. el. IV 82: ana lā simātišu taškuniš ana paraṣ enūti “ Inappropriate for him, you have installed him in the office of lordship.” 4. Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule describes how several armies banded their forces together and advanced against the Assyrian king. This passage not only has literary allusions to Enūma Eliš (puhuršunu innendū “they were advancing towards me as a group”), but also to Sargon II’s Eighth Campaign against Urartu, in which the enemy is said to advance like a swarm of locusts.
a. Chic. Pr. v 55‒57: ana ahameš iqrubūma puhuršunu innendū kīma tibūt aribī ša pān šatti mithāriš ana epēš tuqmāte tebūni ṣērūa “Like a spring

invasion of a swarm of locusts they were advancing towards me as a group to do battle.” b. En. el. I 21: innendūma athū ilāni “the divine brethren banded together, (confusing Tiāmat as they moved about in their stir).” c. TCL 3 187: kīma tibūt aribī “like a swarm of locusts” 5. The use of the verb šêlu “to sharpen” in the sense of sharpening weapons in preparation for battle is attested in the Middle Assyrian period in LKA 62:6 (here the verb sahānu is used), LKA 63, and in the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser I.
a. Tigl. I RIMA 2, A.0.87.1 i 36‒37: šatammu ṣīru ša dAššur kakkīšu ušaʾʾilu “exalted temple administrator, whose weapons the god Aššur has sharpened.”
b. LKA 63:6′‒7′: i[kpudū] ina libbīšun tuqunta mārū // t[āhāza] ik[ṣ]urū išēlū kakkīšun “The sons of the [mountains(?)] devised warfare in their hearts. They prepared for battle, they sharpened their weapons.”76 c. Chic. Pr. v 62: ušaʾʾalū kakkēšun “(and keeping me from the water source), they sharpened their weapons.”
d. En. el. IV 92: u ilānu ša tahāzi ušaʾʾalu šunu kakkēšun “while the gods of battle were sharpening their weapons.” 6. The rare adverbial expression urruhiš, “quickly” is not attested in royal inscriptions before the reign of Sennacherib and provides a further intertextual link with Enūma Eliš. It is, however, also attested in the Middle Assyrian Tukultī-Ninurta Epic:
a. TKN Epic iii 47: umma urruhiš luddi [...] “Quickly now, let me know ....” b. Chic. Pr. v 66‒67: suppêʾa urruhiš išmû illikū rēṣūtī “they immediately heeded my prayers (and) came to my aid.”
c. En. el. II 113: kišād Tiāmat urruhiš takabbas attā, “You will soon trample on Tiāmat’s neck.” As Elnathan Weissert observes, “the common adverb links the alarmed state of Sennacherib and his divine supporters with the impatience of Anšar to send Marduk into battle.”77 7. A typical image used to describe the overwhelming force of the attacking king is that of the rampaging lion. Thus in the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic the warriors of Aššur face the Kassite king, and though they are not clad in armor they nevertheless spring forth like lions:
a. TKN “iii” 39 = iv [=A rev.] 39: sar[i]jamāti ul ittahlipū labbiš ilabbubū b. Sennacherib describes himself as a raging lion before he puts on his armor:

Chic. Pr. v 67b‒69a: labbiš annadirma attalbiša // siriam huliam simat ṣēlti āpira rāšūa “I raged up like a lion, then put on armor (and) placed a helmet suitable for combat on my head.”78 c. The same leonine imagery occurs in the Erra Epic in Erra’s speech addressing the third among the Sebetti:
Erra I 34: it[ami] ana šalši zīm labbi lū šaknāta āmirka lih!harmiṭ “He co[mmanded] the third: Make yourself the appearance of a lion, let him who sees you be paralyzed with fear.” 8. The image of the king driving his chariot over the dead bodies of the enemy and flattening (sapānu) their corpses is yet another key motif demonstrating invincible royal vigor and prowess. This image is already attested in the iconography of the Standard of Ur (fig. 52) and is supplemented in Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule by the image of the king grasping the bow of Aššur and the arrow ready to cut short the lives of the rebellious (see fig. 53). After Marduk creates the destructive winds and the Deluge as his weapons in Enūma Eliš, he mounts his terrible chariot with its four-steed team – the steeds are called the “Slaugtherer,” the “Merciless,” the “Overwhelmer,”, and the “Soaring” – and the chariot itself inspires tremendous terror and fear: a. En. El. IV 50‒54 He mounted the irresistible and terrible storm-chariot, He hitched to it the four-steed team, he tied them at his side: “Slaughterer,” “Merciless,” “Overwhelmer,” “Soaring.”
78 Note the Hurrian origin of the terms for armor and helmet.

This fragment describes the parts of the chariot in line with the sequence provided in Angimdimma rather than with the sequence of Ur5.ra = hubullu (MSL VI 5 ff.):79 Angimdimma 52‒77

76‒77 When, at Enlil’s command he was making his way toward Ekur, the warrior of the gods was leveling the land (sapānu in bilingual edition).
c. Chic. Pr. v 69b‒73: ina narkabti tahazīya ṣirti sāpinat za’īri ina uggat libbīya artakab hantiš qaštu dannatu ša Aššur ušatlima ina qātīya aṣbat šiltāhu pāri’ napšāti atmuh rittūʾa “In my anger, I rode quickly in my exalted battle chariot, which lays enemies low. I took in my hand the mighty bow that the god Aššur had granted to me (and) I grasped in my hand an arrow that cuts off life.” d. In Enūma Eliš the image of Marduk grasping a special weapon appears separately from the image of him riding his chariot. The former image precedes the latter and is linked to the gods’ command that Marduk kill Tiāmat:
En. el. IV 30‒31: iddinūšu kak lā mahra dāʾipu zayyāri / alikma ša Tiāmat napšatuš puru’ma “They gave him an unrivalled weapon which overwhelms the enemy, (saying): ‘Go and pierce Tiāmat’s throat.’ The rare expression napišta parāʾu is common to both Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule and Enūma Eliš, and both texts emphasize the divine endowment of the weapon.80 The image of piercing the throat recurs in Chic. Pr. vi 3. 9. The lengthy description of Marduk preparing his chariot for battle in Enūma Eliš (En. El. IV 50 ff.) is followed by Marduk’s creation of the four horrible winds, which can be compared with the image of the king blowing like the onset of a severe storm that occurs in Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule:
a. Chic. Pr. v 77: kīma tīb mēhê šamri ana nakri azīq “I blew like the onset of a severe storm against the enemy.”
b. The Tukultī-Ninurta Epic uses similar imagery: TKN iv (= A rev.) 40‒43 The irresistible Weapon of Aššur meets (in battle) those attacking [his] for[ce]. And Tukultī-Ninurta, the raging, pitiless storm (ūmu ekdu la pādû), made [their blood] flow. The warriors of Aššur (struck) the army of the king of the Kassites like a serpent, A furious attack, an indomitable onslaught (ašgugu dannu tīb la mahār) [came] upon them.
c. Erra I 36: ana hanši iqtabi kīma šāri zīqma kippātu hīṭa “To the fifth (weapon) he said: ‘Sweep on like the wind and penetrate into the ends of the world.”
80 Weissert 1997, 194 f. Weissert further refers to the fact that this image already occurs once in the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III (Annals 17:11′) as restored by H. Tadmor, and equally mentions the ceremonial temple name Marduk pāriʾ napišti ayyābī “Marduk-Is-the Piercer-ofEnemies” with reference to George 1993, 57.

Erra I 115: kī šāri azâqu kī dAdad ur[t]aṣan “Like the wind I blow, like Adad I thunder.”

The verbal form lištahhiṭamma appears in comparable contexts in Enūma Eliš and Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule:
a. Chic. Pr. v 78‒79: ina kakkē Aššur bēlīya u tīb tahāzīya // zumuršunu lištahhiṭamma lā inēʾʾû i[rassun] “With the weapons of the god Aššur, my lord, and my fierce battle array, I turned them back and made them retreat.”
b. En. El. I 140: zumuršunu lištahhiṭamma lā inēʾʾû i[rassun] “let their (the monsters’) bodies keep attacking and not turn away.” 11. In Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule the uṣṣu-arrow is used to pierce the corpses of the enemy; the same arrow is used to attack the walls of Babylon in the Erra Epic, where the walls stand in as a synecdoche for Babylon’s citizens and their piercing by the arrow leads them to cry out in pain:
a. Chic. Pr. v 80‒81: ummānāt nakiri ina uṣṣi mulmulli ušaqqirma “I shot the troops of the enemy with uṣṣu-arrows (and) mulmullu-arrows, and (pierced all their corpses like ...)”

Erra IV 16: ša Imgur-Enlil uṣṣa elīšu tummidma uʾa libbi iqtabi “As to the (city wall) Imgur-Enlil, you have struck it with (your) arrow so that it says ‘Woe my heart.’” See also Erra i 90: ša uṣṣīni zaqti kepâta liša[n]šu “the tip (lit. tongue) of our sharp arrow is blunted.” c. The mulmullu-arrow used by Sennacherib also features as one of Marduk’s weapons in Enūma Eliš: En. El. IV 34‒41: On the path to success and authority did they (the gods) set him marching. He made the bow, appointed his weapon, He mounted the arrow (mulmullu), set it on the string. He took up the mace, held it in his right hand, Bow and quiver he slung on his arm. Thunderbolts he set before his face With raging fire he covered his body. Then he made a net to enclose Tiāmat within. d. The use of Marduk’s mulmullu-arrow against Tiāmat parallels its “piercing” used by Sennacherib:
En. El. IV 100: issuk mulmulla ihtepi karassa “He shot off the mulmullu-arrow and split her belly.”

off the catchwater: namba’ī uptalliša ana babālim kuppu “He drilled through her waterholes to carry off the catchwater.” 12. Comparing the enemy to sacrificial animals slaughtered in ritual contexts endows the actions of the Assyrian king with a religious overtone and can be identified in various texts: a. Chic. Pr. v 82b-vi 1: “I quickly slaughtered and defeated Humban-undaša, the herald of the king of the land Elam, a trusted man who leads his troops, his main support, together with his magnates, who wear gold (decorated) belt-daggers and have reddish gold sling straps fastened to their forearms, like fattened bulls (kīma šūri marūti) restrained with fetters. I slit their throats like sheep (kišādātišunu unakkis asliš) (and thus) cut off their precious life like thread.” b. In the Tukultī-Ninurta Epic the allies of the Babylonian king are said to be slaughtered like cattle: TKN iv (= A rev. 32‒45) “the warriors of Aššur [fell] upon the king of the Kassites like a serpent ... his allies were slaughtered like cattle.” c. Similarly, Enūma Eliš compares the enemy to a bull: En. El. IV 123‒129 Having captured and vanquished his enemies Having subjugated the mighty enemy like a wild bull (šūrišam),81 Having fully achieved Anšar’s victory over his enemies, Valiant Marduk having attained what Nudimmud desired, He made firm his hold over the captured gods, Then turned back to Tiāmat whom he had captured.82 13. In the Tukultī-Ninurta-Epic the Babylonian king threatens to soak the pastures with the blood of the Assyrians, which will flood over their camp a threat made good by the Assyrians against the Babylonians. The metaphor of torrents of blood is also used by Sennacherib and appears in the Erra Epic: a. TKN iv (= A rev.) 32′ f.: m[ā] annû ūmu šá dām nišē(UNmeš)-ka umakkaru namê qerbēti // [u] elu (UGU) karāšika kī[ma d]Adde ušettaqu abūb n[aš]panti “This is the day, your people’s blood will soak the pastures and meadows, // And like the leveling of the flood pass over your camp.”
b. Chic. Pr. vi 3‒5: kīma mīli gapši ša šamûtu simāni ummunîšunu ušarda ṣēr erṣeti “I made their blood flow over the broad earth like a huge flood caused by a seasonal rainstorm.”
81 The terminative ending –iš is followed by the accusative case –am, used adverbially, see Huehnergard, A Grammar of Akkadian, § 28.2 and § 28.4). See also the translation of Talon 2005, 94. 82 Foster 2005, 461.



The Intertextuality of Sennacherib’s Account of the Battle of Halule 319
c. Erra IV 34‒35: damēšunu kīma mê rāṭi tušaṣbita ribit āli // umunnâšunu taptêma tušabbil nāra “You made their blood flow along the square of the city like water in a channel // you leased their blood and let the river carry it off.” Like Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule, the Erra Epic uses the highly poetic term umunnû for “blood.”
Intertextual references to the Erra Epic can be questioned on the ground that unlike Sennacherib or Marduk, Erra rages indiscriminately, killing both good and bad. Only when all enemies are killed is Erra placated, decreeing the rebuilding of Akkad so that the land can flourish anew. This notion of complete destruction followed by renewal, however, follows the chaîne opératoire laid out in Enūma Eliš, in which Marduk kills Tiāmat in order to create the cosmos out of her corpse. It is thus not the Erra Epic but Sennacherib who deviates from established mythological patterns of total destruction and rebuilding. After Sennacherib destroyed Babylon by means of ritual flooding, he did not intend for the city to be rebuilt.83 Although Sennacherib’s attack on Babylon mirrors that of Erra during Marduk’s absence (Erra I 180‒191) and this parallel is used to make sense of Sennacherib’s brutal devastation and destruction of the city, Sennacherib deviates from traditional cultural norms by failing to envision the rebuilding of Babylon. As the foundation inscription of Sennacherib’s newly built akītu-house at Aššur relates,84 Sennacherib transported some of Babylon’s dust to Aššur in order to bury it at the foundation of that temple. This symbolic act served to demonstrate that renewal and creation were the exclusive prerogative of Aššur, while Babylon was consigned to complete annihilation. Already in the 1980s Johannes Renger advocated a literary approach to royal inscriptions. At the time he was scrutinizing the royal inscriptions of Sargon II, stating that their highly literary style – expressed in the use of rare words otherwise attested in synonym lists (primarily Malku = Šarru),85 in the archaizing adoption of titles like (w)aklu, šakkanakku, and šāpiru for the king,86 in vowel and consonant alliteration, and in the intense use of comparison and metaphor along with syntactical features like paratactic structure and chiasm – was otherwise typical of lyric and epic literature. Renger further not

ed the strong intertextual relations between royal inscriptions and texts like Enūma Eliš, the Erra Epic, and the Etana Epic.87 According to Renger, the highly erudite character and literary style of Sargon II’s inscriptions represents an innovation in the corpus of Assyrian royal inscriptions and enabled the development of new models for the articulation of military accounts.88 This literarizing process indeed pervades the royal inscriptions of the Sargonid period and is indicative of the patterns of thought prevailing in the scholarly circles concerned with royal ideological discourse. Scholars in these circles appear to have resorted to literarization and intertextuality as a deliberate cultural strategy that redefined the institution of kingship in mythic terms at a time when the Assyrian empire was approaching the height of its power and was simultaneously extraordinarily powerful and extremely fragile. The mythic redefinition of royal deeds aimed to make sense of reality and represented a cultural strategy for sanctioning the king’s actions and guiding the reception of the texts by their audience. As shown above, the author of Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule clearly intended to do more than compose a simple military account. Assyrian royal inscriptions from the Middle Assyrian period onward make use of the tropological discourse of the combat myth, which operates as the master narrative and determines the emplotment of the events described in these inscriptions. The author of Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule does not draw on various myths and epic texts as hypotexts (A) merely in order to reveal a commonality in the cultural experience of warfare: he draws upon specific texts because they were already part of a literary tradition offering a repertoire of familiar images and metaphors that can explain the king’s actions. Accordingly, the author is able to frame his text as the only possible interpretation of reality and is capable of engraving his own hypertext (B) in the cultural memory.89 In the educated mind, literary allusions drawn from underlying hypotexts evoke these narratives as a whole along with the “phenotext” of the combat myth. These allusions thus invoke particular chains of argumentation whose specific compositional structure as constituents of a line of thought on warfare and royal action serves to frame events in line with the author’s purposes. Myth, then, is not a vague aura of the archaic: it functions

I apply Genette’s concept of hypertextuality in a broader sense using the terms hypotext and hypertext beyond parody, travesty, pastiche, caricature, and forgery, and transposition as intertexts with a pretext.

as an analytical category operating on the basis of images rather than discursive reasoning.90 From the perspective of cognitive linguistics myth supplied the shared experience and cultural memory of the Assyrian community, which contributed to the process of cultural construction and the production of meaning.91 Beyond prescribing the only possible chaîne opératoire of royal action, intertextuality between myth and Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule can be considered as a cultural strategy deliberately chosen by the scholar in order to present the only acceptable authoritative statement and to justify Sennacherib’s singularly brutal treatment of the Babylonians and Elamites.92 The intertextuality that characterizes Sennacherib’s account of the battle of Halule and Sargon’s Eighth Campaign is also evident in Esarhaddon’s Apology and in the royal inscriptions of Ashurbanipal. Several formulas in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions can be traced back to the heroic poems of the Middle Assyrian period. Such intertextuality reveals that form and narrative techniques should not be regarded as neutral until they are filled with content. Rather, “narrative modes were highly semanticized and engaged in the process of cultural construction”93 and in the production of meaning.

9 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship:
Rethinking Ancient Historiography
9.1 Introduction
So far, this study has focused on the divine warrior Ningirsu/Ninurta as a model for kingship and on the Ninurta mythology as a paradigm for the narrative of the king’s deeds in both literary and historiographic texts. There are, however, two moments in Mesopotamian history when it is possible to observe a cultural strategy that promotes individual rulers as paradigmatic models for kingship, though the actual processes by which this strategy was pursued differ greatly in each case. The first such moment is in the Old Babylonian period, when scribes self-consciously conceived of the kings Sargon and Narām-Sîn of Akkad as the prototypes for future monarchs and articulated this vision in omen literature and in the development of a rich literary corpus centered on these kings. The second such moment – initiated by the relevant monarchs themselves rather than by later scribes – dates to the Sargonid period, when the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal decided to write their royal deeds into the historical record by incorporating them into the well-known and distinct text categories of oracles and divination compendia, a cultural strategy fully in keeping with that of the Old Babylonian scribes. Although the Sargonic and the Sargonid kings are separated by sixteen centuries, the cultural innovations that led to their establishment as paradigmatic figures were not entirely independent of each other. Indeed, the two Neo-Assyrian rulers appear to have refashioned the Old Babylonian precedent for their own purposes. In Ashurbanipal’s case, we know that he was familiar with the omen tradition that referred to the kings of Akkad and Ur III as prototypes for royal action, as it is in his library that a tablet recording only historical omens was found.1 Both Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal drew on prophecy and extispicy as techniques for communication with the gods, but the distinct nature of these techniques one inductive, the other deductive – resulted in significant differences in how these kings were inscribed in the historical record as paradigms for rulership. The historiographic innovations of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal cannot be isolated from the prolific textual production that characterizes the entirety of the Sargonid period. In a time when deviation from the law of primogeniture, the violation of international agreements, and internal disharmony threatened to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of individual Sargonid

The Legitimating Command of Aššur: Royal Reports and Divine Letters 323
kings, the importance of divine sanction and the pretension of complying with the dictates of time-honored tradition became ever more pronounced. It is precisely during this period that textual production centered on the figure of the king diversified and become more sophisticated in its argumentation – Hayim Tadmor goes so far as to speak of regicentric literature.2 Striking in this development is the apparent preference for dialogue – real or fictive – as the literary framework through which to illustrate and emphasize repeatedly the homogeneity and congruence in action between the king and the gods. The move toward a dialogical literary setting is evident in the Royal Report of the King to the God Aššur and the Letter of Aššur to the King,3 in the secondary textualization of prophecy in the collective oracle tablets, and in the Fictive Dialogue between Ashurbanipal and Nabû.4 Typical of these new compositions is their retrospective perspective, in which divine sanction for the deeds of the king is continually sought. Since it is this retrospective perspective that shaped the overall character of the Royal Report to the God Aššur and the Letter of the God Aššur, these text categories will be discussed before I turn to the case studies of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal. These case studies will in turn examine how history was rewritten through the use of established text categories like prophecy and omen compendia.
9.2 The Legitimating Command of Aššur: Royal Reports and Divine Letters
The Royal Report to the god Aššur and the Letter of the God Aššur represent two text categories that were written at the end of a royal campaign in order to conclude the communicative process between the king and the gods that served to secure the king’s victory in battle. Channels of communication included astrological omens, dream oracles, prophecy, and extispicy, which were consulted both prior to and during wartime, first to confirm a propitious moment in which to embark on campaign and subsequently to overcome any crises while on campaign.5 Although extispicy was the standard means for verifying homogeneity in human and divine intentionality, other techniques are in

324 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
voked as a group at seemingly insurmountable moments of military challenge, for instance by Ashurbanipal immediately prior the battle of Tell Tuba:
Upon the command of Aššur and Marduk, the Great Gods, my lords, who encouraged me with good omens, dreams, oracular utterances, and prophetic messages (ina ittāti damqāti šutti egerrê šipir mahhê), I defeated him in Tell Tuba.6
These techniques can also be invoked at the moment of victory itself, as is the case when Esarhaddon refers to divine favor at the time of his ascension to the throne:
(i 87‒ii 11) In Addaru (XII), a favorable month, on the eighth day, the eššeššu-festival of the god Nabû, I joyfully entered Nineveh, my capital city, and I sat happily on the throne of my father. The south wind, the breeze of the god Ea, the wind whose blowing is favorable for exercising kingship, blew upon me. (ii. 5) Favorable signs came in good time to me in heaven and earth. They (the gods) continually and regularly encouraged me with oracles through ecstatics, the message(s) of the gods and goddess(es). I sought out every one of the guilty soldiers, who wrongly incited my brothers to exercise kingship over Assyria, and imposed a grievous punishment on them: I exterminated their offspring.7
The composition of royal reports and divine letters, by contrast, does not appear to have been standard practice for military campaigns. Such texts were only written when there was a severe violation of a tacit or an explicit international agreement or when the king was involved in fratricide. In other words, royal reports and divine letters were only composed when the king’s actions required divine legitimization in the form of a divine command that sanctioned the royal deed. A. Leo Oppenheim observes that in Sargon II’s letter to the god Aššur concerning his pillaging of the temple of the Urartean national god Haldi, which was located in Muṣaṣir and served as the cultic center for the coronation ceremonies of the Urartean kings, the Assyrian king “offers here an argument in his defense, an argument that anticipates a human reaction which the reference to a divine pronouncement is meant to counter.”8 Although the pillaging of temples regularly featured as one of the destructive measures inflicted upon enemies by the Assyrian kings, Sargon II’s seemingly unprovoked pillaging of Muṣaṣir was a contentious and potentially sacrilegious act that required divine sanction in the eyes of some of his contemporaries. A brief overview of the form of royal reports and divine letters will contribute to a better understanding of their function. Although royal reports to the

The Legitimating Command of Aššur: Royal Reports and Divine Letters 325
god are accounts of military campaigns, they differ from ordinary royal inscriptions in that they can include an introductory section addressing the god directly – and in some cases other parties – and a postscript reporting on casualties.9 Furthermore, royal reports can use poetic language, as is the case in Sargon II’s report on his eighth campaign to Urartu, and they can include unusual reflections on the theme of royal responsibility, as is the case in Esarhaddon’s report on his campaign to Šubria.10 Divine letters, by contrast, incorporate verbatim quotes from royal reports and can even refer to them with the formula ša tašpuranni “according to what you wrote to me.”11 Because of this formula, I suggest restricting the category “divine letter” to those texts of the first millennium that identify the god as the sender of the letter.12 Divine letters and royal reports have five typical features: 1. Both text categories reflect a written communication in line with the sender–recipient model. 2. In divine letters the god is sends the letter, whereas in royal reports it is the king who is the sender. 3. Formally, both text categories resemble the letter style, while the kings may address the god Aššur in a longer eulogy.13 Divine letters omit the address to the king but the discursive mode of the dialogue is maintained in the direct speech addressed to the king. Several divine letters use the formula ša tašpuranni “according to what you wrote to me.” 4. Both text categories resemble royal inscriptions in terms of content. Royal reports are written in the first person and make use of the past tense, as do royal inscriptions. 5. Divine letters refer to the deeds of the king in the second person, while divine interference is described in the first person; divine letters also make use of the past tense.
Unlike the oracles of Ištar, which aim to maintain the illusion of direct verbal communication between goddess and king even in their written form, the discursive form of Aššur’s divine letters aligns with that of commemorative narratives. The commemorative style of divine letters and their similarity in content

326 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
with commemorative inscriptions and royal reports qualifies them as historiographic documents that relate to the deeds of the king in a retrospective perspective. Divine letters quote verbatim from royal reports and modify their phraseology only by adding prepositional elements that refer to the king in the second person, thereby creating a fictive dialogue. Beyond phraseological modifications of this kind, the god in divine letters appropriates actions originally performed by the king. The following excerpt from Aššur’s letter to Ashurbanipal illustrates this principle:
SAA 3 no. 44: 3‒10
3‒4 Because of the evil deeds [which Šamaš-šum-ukīn] committed against you, I pulled out the foundations of his royal throne, over[threw] his reign and [comma]nded the dispersal14 of the entire land of Akkad.
5‒6 To perfect the shrines of the great gods, to renew [...] the offerings, to venerate my divinity (and) a good reign of [...] I decreed as your fate.
7‒10 As for Šamaš-šum-ukīn, who did not keep my treaty, but sinned against the charity of Ashurbanipal, my beloved king, I confined him in harsh imprisonment and bound [...]. I placed lead ropes on his magnates and [lead] them to [your] presence.
In the above passage, the underlying royal report retains its basic phraseological structure but is subjected to two forms of editorial revision in order to effectuate its transformation into a divine letter. First, the author intersperses the erstwhile royal report with legitimizing formulae that present the deeds of the king as consequent to the command of the god. Second, by framing the whole text as a divine response to the king’s report, the author evokes a situation of dialogue between god and king. The fictive dialogue between king and god does not aim at the exchange of information. Instead, the goal of this interaction is to consolidate the relationship between king and god and consequently to re-establish the harmonious balance between the divine and earthly realms, albeit with both a contemporary and a future audience in mind.15 In my view, Aššur’s sanctioning of the king’s deeds was a necessary prerequisite without which the king was not allowed to access the Aššur temple or permitted to perform his triumphal procession. The letter of Sargon II (722‒705 BCE) to the god Aššur, in which he reports on his eighth campaign to Urartu, will serve to make my case. Its introductory section and its postscript in particular shed light on the king’s accountability
14 Unlike Livingstone, SAA 3 no. 44:3‒4 I prefer to render sapāhu as dispersal rather than as destruction. 15 Pongratz-Leisten 1999, 284.



The Legitimating Command of Aššur: Royal Reports and Divine Letters 327
to the elites,16 as well as on the involvement of elites in the king’s communication with the gods. The form and content of both sections is already familiar from Shalmaneser IV’s (783‒773 BCE) report to Aššur, but with one important exception: Shalmaneser IV lists only the god Aššur and the gods dwelling in the Aššur temple as recipients of his letter, while Sargon II (722‒705 BCE) uniquely includes the city of Aššur and its citizens in his greeting formula:
1. To Aššur, father of the gods, great lord who dwells in Ehursaggalkurkurra, his great abode, hail, all hail! 2. To the gods of destinies and the goddesses who dwell in Ehursaggalkurkurra, their great abode, hail, all hail! 3. To the gods of destinies and the goddesses who dwell in the city of Aššur, their great abode, hail, all hail! 4. To the city and its people, hail, all hail, to the palace located in it hail, all hail! 5. For Sargon, the pure priest, the servant who reveres your great divinity and his army, all is well.17
The fact that Sargon II’s address includes the elites of Aššur – this is probably what is meant by “its people” (nišēšu) – reflects the change that must have resulted from Tiglath-pileser III’s (744‒727 BCE) reduction of Assyrian vassal states to the status of provinces, a process that significantly extended the borders of the Assyrian empire. One of the consequences of this expansion was the attendant growth of the upper echelons of Assyria’s bureaucracy, thus making the entire system more vulnerable to internal instability. This political change in turn informed Assyrian cultural discourse, as is illustrated by the development of new text categories. In their function as shapers of the Assyrian weltanschauung and as managers of communication between the gods and the king, scholars had to create a cultural discourse that reflected Assyrian political achievements and harmonized them with the cosmic order so as to foster the illusion of absolute royal control. It was precisely this demand for concerted communication between the gods and the king and its public display, however, that made the scholars indispensable to the king and promoted their monopolies in divinatory techniques, in shaping state rituals, and in elaborating textual and iconographic programs that insulated the monarch against any human judgment. The introductory formula of royal reports is modeled after the phraseology of Neo-Assyrian letters, a fact that impelled A. Leo Oppenheim to assume that

328 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
they “were written, not to be deposited in silence in the sanctuary, but to be actually read to a public that was to react directly to their contents.”18 The public that Oppenheim had in mind consisted of the priesthood, the city as a corporate unit represented by the elders, and the city’s inhabitants in general. The priesthood itself, however, consisted of cultic functionaries with circumscribed cultic and administrative duties; excepting the šangû of Aššur and the šangûs of other gods, it is doubtful whether the priesthood constituted a strong and discrete social group in Aššur.19 The role of the scholars was certainly more incisive, as they functioned as guardians of tradition and controlled both the king’s public display and his interaction with the divine realm. As has been pointed out by Tadmor,20 it is not clear if the elders, who were presumably equivalent to the heads of the wealthy merchant families in the Old Assyrian period, still played a role in Middle Assyrian times; it is all the more questionable if such elders played an appreciable role in the Neo-Assyrian period. While Oppenheim’s interpretation of Sargon II’s letter to the god is very suggestive, it is unsupported by the evidence. In fact, there is no need for a public setting for the reading of this letter, and indeed the Aramaic speaking environment of the time likely meant that the letter, with its unusual lexicography, would not even have been understood by the general public. In the stele bearing his laws, Hammurabi – like Sargon II in his letter to the god – claims to address his people. Hammurabi’s stele was set up in the courtyard of the temple, and constitutes a useful point of comparison for the setting of Sargon II’s address to his people. The temple courtyard was accessible only to the functionaries and cultic specialists linked with it, which effectively limits the audience of objects and texts deposited within it to the gods and posterity. It is the colophon of Sargon II’s letter to the god that helps identify its prospective audience and the agents behind the scene. Following its opening epistolary formula, the body of Sargon II’s detailed report on his campaign against Urartu has the narrative form typical of royal inscriptions, though it is unusual in its “poetic language, plays on words, and elaborate figures of speech.”21 At the very end of the report, Sargon II describes his decision to send the army home while he himself – accompanied only by his elite troops deviates from the normal route to go via Muṣaṣir, home of the temple of the chief god of the Urartian pantheon, Haldi, and the place where Urartian kings

were crowned. Sargon II destroys the temple of the god Haldi, abducts its gods, and plunders all of its belongings. This account concludes with a 5‒line colophon, which is unusual for the epistolary text category but typical of those texts that were collected in the libraries of the scholars and kings and thus comprised the stream of tradition. The colophon does not, however, identify the tablet as the king’s property, but as the property of the chief scribe of the king, who is explicitly described as a scholar of Sargon II. After its composition, the tablet somehow found its way into the library of the chief exorcist of the Aššur temple, who likely had a particular interest in the figure of Sargon II. The Sargon Geography, a text that portrays Sargon II as the follower of the paradigmatic great king Sargon of Akkad, was also part of this library. Interestingly, both the Sargon Geography and Sargon II’s report on his eight campaign involve the notion of an imaginary empire of nearly cosmological dimensions.22 The colophon of Sargon II’s report reads as follows:
426 One charioteer, two horsemen, and three scouts (of those who) were killed. 427 I made Ṭāb-šār-Aššur, the chief-steward, send the men (who bring) first rate messages (lúEME.SAGmeš) to Aššur, my lord. 428 Tablet of Nabû-šallim-šunu, chief scribe of the king, chief tablet scribe,23 scholar of Sargon, king of Assyria, 429 First born son of Harmakki, royal scribe, a native of Aššur. 430 (The report) was delivered in the eponym year of Issar-dūri, governor of Arrapha.
I will refrain here from discussing the various renderings of line 427,24 which are complicated by the fact that in some royal reports to the god Aššur the term lisānu rēštu (lúeme.SAGmeš) is used without the determinative lú and can be translated as “first rate message,” a translation that I think is most appropriate to Sargon II’s text. Furthermore, scholarly opinion hinges upon the question as to whether the verb ultēbila should be translated in the first or in the third person singular: “I made send” or “he (Ṭāb-šār-Aššur) made send.” The 1st person possessive pronoun “my lord” leads me to assume Sargon II as the subject of this sentence. What is of particular interest is that this colophon indicates the involvement of several parties in Sargon II’s report to the god. One figure is Nabûšallim-šunu, the king’s scholar and the apparent composer of the tablet, and the other is the chief steward and treasurer Ṭāb-šār-Aššur who, according to

information gleaned from the epistolary record, was responsible for inspections of all kinds and for work assignments to palaces and temples in various cities, in addition to being involved in political affairs more broadly.25 Unfortunately, very little is known of Sargon II’s scholar Nabû-šallim-šunu. He is mentioned in a text that reports on his partaking in offerings and purification ceremonies performed in the Aššur temple prior to Sargon II’s triumphal procession.26 These activities in the Aššur temple took place on the 21st of the month Kislimu or Ṭebetu. If we assume that the date for the king’s triumphal procession to the Aššur temple was set in the eleventh month Šabaṭu as mentioned in the later ritual text for Ashurbanipal A 125,27 then the textual evidence suggests that the chief scribe had to perform some preparatory rites in order to allow the king to enter the city after his military campaign. Whether or not it was Nabû-šallim-šunu who brought the report of the king before Aššur on this particular occasion is a matter of speculation. In any event, the royal report likely reached the Aššur temple at some point before Sargon II’s triumphal entry into the city; divine letters written in response to royal reports survive from the reigns of Šamšī-Adad V (823‒811 BCE)28 and Ashurbanipal (668‒631/ 27? BCE).29 In conjunction with the postscripts of the divine letters, the available evidence suggests the following reconstruction of the various steps that were required for the king to be allowed to enter the city of Aššur following a military campaign:30 1. The king’s scribe wrote a report on the king’s campaign; 2. the king sent somebody to Aššur with the report; 3. at some point purification rites were performed at the Aššur temple in order to allow for the triumphal entry of the king into Aššur; in Sargon II’s case, these rites were performed by his chief scribe Nabû-šallim-šunu; 4. Aššur sanctified the report in the form of an oracle, as may be deduced from the subscript miḫrat dibbī [Aššur] “copy of the words of [Aššur]” in Aššur’s letter to Ashurbanipal SAA 3 44;
25 See his correspondence with the king published by Parpola, SAA 1 nos. 41‒74. 26 ND 1120, Wiseman 1952; transcription and translation in van Driel 1969, 200‒204; collated by Postgate in CTN 2 no. 229. 27 The text is dated to the time of Ashurbanipal and arrangements may have been altogether different under his reign, see Menzel 1981, vol. 2, no. 24 i 5. For the interrelationship of these events see already Lanfranchi 1990, 230 f. and fn. 99 28 SAA 3 no. 41. 29 SAA 3 nos. 44 and 45; see also the fragments SAA 3 nos. 42 and 43 to unidentified kings. 30 The idea of a fictive dialogue between king and god enacted first in the royal report that followed a military campaign and then in the letter of the god to the king contradicts the idea of A. L. Oppenheim, who claimed that the royal report was read on the occasion of the king’s entry into the city of Aššur, Oppenheim 1960, 143.



The Legitimating Command of Aššur: Royal Reports and Divine Letters 331
5. on the basis of the royal report, this oracle was rewritten as a divine letter in response to the king; 6. the divine letter was then sent to the king, 7. who was then allowed to perform his triumphal procession and to enter the Aššur temple.
The above reconstruction reveals that the king and the god, i.e. the institutions of the palace and the temple, were the main agents in the communication process. The small number of royal reports and divine letters suggests that this particular form of communication was not standard, but performed only when royal actions necessitated divine legitimization. Actions requiring legitimization of this kind could include the abduction of the gods of the enemy and the destruction of their sanctuaries as described in Sargon II’s report on his campaign to Urartu, or the case of fratricide embedded in Esarhaddon’s report on his campaign to Šubria.31 Divine legitimization is cited in Aššur’s letter to Ashurbanipal regarding the rebellion of Ashurbanipal’s brother Šamaš-šum-ukīn, who was governor of Babylonia and was killed by Ashurbanipal during the civil war. The fact that Sargon II’s treasurer and scholar are only mentioned briefly in the colophon of Sargon II’s report should not mislead us about the extent to which the religious and political elites were involved in this exchange between the king and the god. Similarly, the fact that the text was found in the library of the chief exorcist and carries a colophon attributing it to a scholar rather than to the king should not lead us to assume that we are dealing with a text of private nature, written by a scribe to celebrate the king’s success, as has been suggested by Louis D. Levine.32 The chief exorcist’s library includes tablets from the Middle Assyrian period and from the late eighth century BCE; it also reflects the idiosyncratic choices and preferences of Kiṣir-Aššur, the chief exorcist under Ashurbanipal. This context points to the secondary or even tertiary storage of Sargon II’s report to Aššur.33 The texts assembled in the library, itself an educational center for young scribes, demonstrate that the interests of the chief exorcist extended far beyond the performance of purification rites at the Aššur temple. The chief exorcist was the central figure in the organization of the cult of the Aššur temple and in the collection, compilation, and production of the body of cultural knowledge of the time.

and Hayim Tadmor35 have long cautioned against understanding the title “chief scribe” as referring to a scribe merely in the technical sense of the word. On the contrary, the colophon of Sargon II’s report testifies to the degree to which the scholar responsible for cultic affairs at the Aššur temple and the treasurer were involved in ensuring that the necessary steps were taken to allow Sargon II to enter the city. It is difficult to determine the precise character of the relationship between Sargon II and his scholars, or that of his relationship with the religious elites in Aššur. It seems that in addition to Sargon II’s treasurer, his governor Ṭābṣil-Ešarra36 performed most of the tasks that required Sargon II’s presence in Aššur. Regarding the king’s cooperation with the religious elites, Sargon II tends to emphasize two acts in his commemorative inscriptions: 1) his explicit ceremonial performance of the New Year festival as recorded in his annals, which follows the model of Babylonian kingship,37 and 2) his establishment of tax exempt status not only for the traditional Babylonian cultic centers, but also for the cities of Aššur and Harran, as is proclaimed in a text known in Assyriological literature as the Aššur Charter.38 While this text could be an expression of Sargon II’s personal interest in the city of Aššur, it seems more likely to assume that by the end of the eighth century BCE the political and religious elites in Aššur had achieved a status of sufficient political and religious importance to enable them to claim (and receive) such privileges. Irrespective of what Sargon II did or did not do to arouse the indignation of the citizenry of Aššur, he seems to have avoided visiting the city even for state rituals as so far we have no evidence for his presence in Aššur. Certain prominent figures in Aššur appear to have possessed the power to regulate his entry to the city on the occasion of his triumphal procession, which normally included the offering of at least part of the booty seized on campaign to the Aššur temple. Esarhaddon’s effort to ingratiate himself with the elites of Aššur in his inscriptions by emphasizing that he too composed or perhaps simply confirmed the Aššur Charter ([kā]ṣir kidinnūt BAL.TILki)39 is still another indication of the king’s accountability to the elites of Assyria’s cultic center. The question, then, is whether or not the reconstructed sequence of events that preceded Sargon II’s entry into Aššur represents standard procedure. If it does, then can this sequence of events, which clearly demonstrates the authori

The Legitimating Command of Aššur: Royal Reports and Divine Letters 333
ty of Aššur’s political and religious elites, be assumed to have operated as early as the time of Šamšī-Adad V (823‒811 BCE) and Shalmaneser IV (783‒773 BCE)? It is also possible to argue that the fact that Sargon II’s royal report was found in the exorcist’s library suggests that it was intended to serve as a model for future kings and to remind them that their victory belonged to the god Aššur. In either case, even if religious authority was not able to constrain arbitrary royal behavior and hubris, it nevertheless retained its influence over the formulation of a positive image for rulership and the enhancement of its prestige, thereby contributing to the stability of political power. By means of the ritual actions performed during the king’s triumphal procession to the Aššur temple, Aššur’s religious elite reinforced the message of Aššur’s kingship and the king’s stewardship as proclaimed in the Assyrian coronation ritual. At some point, denying the king’s right to perform his duty as the chief šangû of the god Aššur must have been detrimental to the king’s individual rulership. A denial of this kind would presumably have prompted the king to engage and placate the various stakeholders in the network of power rather than to keep acting altogether unilaterally. The influence of ritual on the exercise of political power thus entails more than protecting the king from any culpability resulting from political mistakes in the performance of his office.40 Ritual assumes a corrective function, as it reminds the king of his personal responsibility. In the process of textualizing the king’s deeds, by contrast, the scholars took on a crucial role in shaping the cultural memory of the individual king. Unfortunately, we do not have a divine letter of the god Aššur legitimizing Sargon II’s pillage of the sacred center of the Urartian kings. It is therefore not possible to determine whether Aššur’s religious elite attempted to manipulate the system of communication in order to support the harmonious balance between earthly and heavenly powers, which would have translated into a positive relationship between the city of Aššur and the king. Scholarly views on the importance of acting in accordance with the will of the gods is expressed in the text of the Sin of Sargon, which, as has been emphasized by Tadmor and Lanfranchi, is a product of the scholarly milieu and implies that both Sargon II and his son and successor Sennacherib paid for their actions with their own untimely deaths.41 The situation of Sennacherib’s successors Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal was different, as both kings challenged tradition by deviating from the law of
40 Such is the argument suggested by Lanfranchi 2003, 104. 41 See Lanfranchi 2003, 107 for the distinction between the institutional and personal figure of the king, and his emphasis that it is the private person of the king that pays for royal misdeeds.

primogeniture. In addition to making use of the text categories discussed above, both Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal promoted themselves as models of governance conducive to the cosmic order. To this end, they relied on prophecy and the divine omen compendia, which they either transformed or reused for their self-promotion or for political purposes.
9.3 The Goddess Ištar and the King
Under King Esarhaddon, royal ideological discourse regarding the control of knowledge shifted from a focus on technology in the proper sense to expertise in divinatory techniques. The ideal image of the king now centered primarily on knowledge of how to communicate with the gods in order to comply publicly with the cosmic design and of how to act in accordance with the divine will. Central to this communication was knowledge of the proper performance of extispicy, of how gods could be appeased in case of portentous omina, and of how to protect oneself by means of exorcistic rituals and prayers. These themes surface repeatedly in the correspondence between the scholars and the king and are even mentioned in commemorative inscriptions. In addition to deductive techniques like extispicy, i.e. the reading of the exta of a sacrificial animal, and lecanomancy, i.e. the inspection of water in a basin, the religious traditions of ancient Syria and Anatolia in particular cultivated the practice of prophecy and dream oracles.42 Although the storm god was the central figure in prophecy in northern Syria, the other powerful figure voicing divine intentionality was Ištar – formerly Ištar-Šauška – who during the late Sargonid period assumed the role of the midwife and wet nurse to the crown prince while simultaneously providing him with her oracles.43 Accordingly, in addition to being the legitimate heir in genealogical terms and being the designated crown prince through confirmation by means of the swearing of loyalty oaths, the crown prince was supported by his institutional relationship with the goddess, which served as a central cultural strategy for establishing the king and sacralizing his rulership.44 It was Esarhaddon in particular
42 Nissinen 2003. 43 Pongratz-Leisten 2003. 44 Beckman 2000, 18. The most important information with regard to the medical duties and the work of the midwife stem from literary texts such as hymns and myths describing diverse goddesses performing the role of the midwife, among them the goddess Ninisina of Isin. In his book on childbirth, Martin Stol summarizes the midwife’s tasks as follows: “She makes the woman sit on the bricks of the birth, she may have punctured the amniotic sac, she delivers the child, cuts the umbilical cord, disposes of the afterbirth. She applies ointments to the

who exploited this institution for his succession politics and who disregarded the custom of installing the eldest son as crown prince. In the cultural history of Mesopotamia, the role of Inanna/Ištar as mediator between the leader of the pantheon and the king and her empowering of the king in his office was originally clad in the relational framework of the hieros gamos, which can be traced back as far as the Early Dynastic period and which persisted through the Ur III and Isin/Larsa periods.45 This sexual metaphor allowed Inanna to confer the divine blessing on the king in her capacity as the divine assembly’s representative, thereby establishing the king’s intimate relationship with the divine world and granting him his share of divine knowledge.46 Inanna’s blessing was an expression of Enlil’s and An’s approval of the king’s correct performance of his royal duties, which entailed the proper care for the cult of the gods.47 It is interestingly in the ideological discourse of pre-Sargonic Lagaš that Inanna is attested for the first time in the role of the midwife. In Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures (ca. 2450 B.C.) we read the following:
[Lor]d? [Ni]ngirsu, [war]rior of [En]lil (3 cases frag.) [Ni]n[gir]su [imp]lanted the [semen] for E[a]natum in the [wom]b (2 cases broken) and [...] rejoiced over [Eanatum]. Inana accompanied him, named him Eana-Inana-Ibgalakakatum,48 and set him on the special lap of Ninhursag. Ninhursag [offered him] her special breast. Ningirsu rejoiced over Eanatum, semen implanted in the womb by Ningirsu. Ningirsu laid his span upon him, for (a
mother and rubs the newborn.” Stol 2000, 171. See also the Sumerian hymn to the goddess Ninisina of Isin, which describes with great precision her role as a midwife: SRT 6 rev. iii 1‒8//SRT 7 ll. 11‒19 “For the thousands of young maidens to establish fertility, to regulate the womb, to cut the umbilical cord, to determine the fates, to support the door of the Nigin-gar, to let the fetus come to a successful completion, the human child, after it has been received in the lap – to make it cry loudly, to put the belly downwards, to turn it upside down, to perform? the nugig-ship, to act quickly, to sing proper praise, when she has made manifest the great me, and my Lady, has spoken the hymn of praise, Ninisina fittingly praise yourself!” The exaltation of Ninisina in the period of the Isin Dynasty results in her merger with Inanna of Uruk and her adoption of Inanna’s epithets and function as “great lady of the gods” and as a warrior-like goddess. For the edition of that text see, Römer 1969. 45 Cooper 1993; Steinkeller 1999; Lapinkivi 2004. 46 Pongratz-Leisten 2008. 47 Pongratz-Leisten 2008, 55. 48 “Worthy in the Eana of Inana of the Ibgal.”

length of) five forearms he set his forearm upon him: (he measured) five forearms (cubits), one span! Ningirsu, with great joy, [gave him] the kin[gship of Lagaš].49
Placing the newborn crown prince on the knees of his parent is performed by Inanna, who places the child on the lap of the mother goddess Ninhursag in the rhetoric of royal ideology.50 In Eannatum’s case, Inanna also assumes the role of the father by calling the crown prince by his throne-name. As such, Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures is the very earliest attestation of the cultural metaphor relating to Inanna’s central role in legally accepting and naming newborn children, and in establishing the social relationship between the king and the divine world. By the Isin-Larsa period at the latest, the legal act of naming was absorbed by the chief god of the pantheon. This is attested in the royal self-praise of Išme-Dagan:
He (Enlil) named me with a favorable name even when my seed was inserted into the womb. Nintud stood at my birth, and she established the office of en for me ..., even when my umbilical cord was cut. Enlil, my principal deity, bestowed on me the shepherdship of Sumer, and assigned to me a tireless protective goddess ... He selected me from my people, and announced me to the land ...51
Drawing exclusively on Early Dynastic evidence from Lagaš (though it does form part of what I would call the Tigridian cultural zone) to explain NeoAssyrian cultural choices in the development of royal ideology might seem farfetched to some readers. It is also possible to refer to later Syro-Anatolian tradition, which has much to offer regarding the conceptualization of Ištar as a prophesying deity and as midwife and wet nurse to the crown prince. Ištar’s role as midwife and wet nurse to the crown prince is already attested at the royal court of Tupkiš at Urkeš around 2250 BCE. Here, even the name of the midwife is known from her own seal.52 Of particular interest for our discussion is the seal of King Tupkiš himself, which shows him seated on a throne with a lion reclined at his feet. The crown prince is standing on the lion’s head, visually conveying a dynastic message by touching his father’s lap. A divinity

This role of Ninhursag, assumed on the human level by the father, supports Peter Steinkeller’s view that the “earliest Sumerian pantheon was dominated by female deities,” Steinkeller 1999, 113, a position that has, however, been questioned recently by Michalowski, 2002. 51 Išme-Dagan A 43 ff., see Reisman 1970; Jacobsen 1987, 112‒124; Römer 1989, 659‒673; Jacobsen 1997, 547‒550. 52 Buccellati and Kelly-Buccellati 1997, 83.

quite possibly Ištar – feeds the lion, while a star hovers in front of her (fig. 54). Nurses are further known from the royal court of Mari during the Old Babylonian period.53 These women entered into contractual relations and were paid in grain, silver, or gold,54 as is shown by a later inventory of gifts from king Tušratta of Mitanni.55 A text from Nuzi seems to indicate that the wet nurse “retained a certain degree of importance long after her duties were finished.”56 Hittite mythology explicitly refers to the performance of the midwife in the Hurrian-derived Song of Ullikummi, in which “the midwives aided the delivery of the monster Ullikummi and the Nurses, the Fate and Mother goddesses, lifted him and placed him on the knees of his father. The father expressed his joy and named the child. The same child-lifting occurred in the Appu story, also of Hurrian derivation, but only the Nurse, written logographically UMMEDA,

In the Hittite context magic knowledge probably expanded from the office of midwifery, a proposal advanced by G. Beckman on the basis of the term “old woman,” which is frequently used in magical texts, see Beckman 1983, 232‒235.



338 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
is mentioned.”57 Hittite mythology thus conveys the two important legal acts of taking the infant and naming the infant, the latter being done by the father, who thereby recognizes and accepts the newborn child. The legal act of taking the child was considered so important that it became a motif in Hittite birth rituals.58 Assyrian ideological discourse combined the role of Inanna/Ištar as midwife and wet nurse with her role as a prophesying deity who intervened on behalf of the crown prince and future king. Prophetic intervention by Ištar is also attested in Ešnunna, once more in the Tigridian region, and in the only Old Babylonian oracle of southern Babylonia that is spoken by the goddess Nanaya of Uruk rather than Inanna/Ištar of Uruk.59 Ešnunna was as much part of the Tigridian cultural horizon as it was of the Sumero-Babylonian alluvial plain, and the two oracles of Ešnunna spoken by Ištar-Kitītum60 may therefore be considered the earliest examples of a cultural strategy inspired by northern Mesopotamian and Syro-Anatolian practice rather than Sumero-Babylonian tradition.61 It is probably Ištar-Šauška of Ninet/Nineveh – referred to in the Mari letters62 – who provided the model for conceptualizing Ištar-Kitītum as a prophesying deity in the kingdom of Ešnunna where, in a retrospective prophecy, she acknowledges King Ibal-pi-El II’s succession to the throne.63 As pointed out in Chapter Three, the cult of Ištar-Šauška at Nineveh had become so important by the Old Babylonian period that Šamšī-Adad I (1808‒1776 BCE) read the oracles (têrētum) before going on campaign. He wrote to his son:
The oracle readings that I have done here (i.e. at Nineveh) have been very favorable. They yielded a presage of glory. This is what they say about this enemy: “You will not meet with failure.” [The oracle readings] carried your sign. You will [def]eat them. You [will ach]ieve [triumph]. Get your troops [into formation]: you do [not] risk falling into an ambush.”64
Although Jean-Marie Durand has drawn attention to the fact that têrtum can also have the meaning of oracle, it is not entirely clear whether the above letter refers to extispicy or prophecy.65

The Goddess Ištar and the King 339
Prophecy is, however, certainly the oracular mode of Ištar-Kitītum’s communication with Daduša’s successor King Ibal-pi-El II (1179‒1765 BCE), in which Kitītum posthumously predicts a successful reign for him:
Kitītum Oracle FLP 1674:
O King Ibal-pi-El! Thus speaks the goddess Kitītum: “The secrets of the gods lie before me, (and) because the invocation of my name is ever in your mouth, I shall reveal to you one by one the secrets (niṣrētu) of the gods. At the advice of the gods, and by the command of Anu, the country is given you to rule. You will loosen the sandals of (+ legally take in possession?) the Upper and Lower Country, you will have at your disposal the treasures of the Upper and Lower Country. Your economy will not diminish. Wherever in the land your hand has laid hold, there will be permanent ‘food of peace.’ (And) I, Kitītum, will strengthen the foundations of your throne. I have provided you with a protective spirit. May your [e]ar be attentive to me!”66
The divine design that Kitītum shares with the king, here referred to as the ‘secrets of the gods,’ revelass that Ibal-pi-El II’s kingdom will expand to include the Upper and Lower lands, that the economy will prosper, and that his rule will be stable.67 Following Jack Sasson, in an earlier article I stressed the formal judicial language that Kitītum uses to authorize the king’s rulership at the end of the oracle: “And I, Kitītum, will strengthen the foundations of your throne.” Legal language of this kind was used by powerful kings to declare their support of a newcomer to the throne, as is demonstrated by the following example taken from a statement made by king Zimrilim of Mari quoting the king of Ešnunna: “As for Zimrilim, I myself have set him on the throne. I want to do what strengthens him and what secures the foundations of his throne.”68 The effect of such language in the context of prophecy is not to be underestimated, as it ties prophecy to divinatory practices and provides it with a legal overtone. Clear evidence for Ištar-Šauška’s role in prophecy during the second half of the second millennium comes from Hittite Anatolia, in particular from the reign of Hattušili III (1267‒ca. 1240 BCE) and from his Apology.69 At least eight different versions of Hattušili III’s Apology have been found in the storeroom
66 de Jong Ellis 1987. 67 Contrary to what I stated in my former article, Pongratz-Leisten 2003, 159, I now interpret niṣrētu as the positive aspects referring to the king’s reign, as laid out by Kitītum, i.e. the divine design for the king. 68 Durand 1987b; Sasson 1998, 463. For a similar wording see Zimri-Lim’s letter A.1153 referring to Yarim-Lim of Halab: “It is my father who brought me to my throne, who will strengthen me and will secure the foundation of my throne,” (Sasson, ibid., 464). 69 Hoffner 1975.

of the Great Temple of the Lower City in Hattuša, which suggests the great importance that the Hittites assigned to the text. It was written at least ten years after Hattušili III deposed and exiled his nephew Urhi-Tešub. As noted by Hayim Tadmor, this apologetic account of the king’s usurpation of the throne is extremely illuminating as a parallel for Esarhaddon.70 Like Hattušili III’s Apology, which in fact represents a Stiftungsurkunde for Ištar of Samuha, Esarhaddon’s Apology was not conceived as a reflection on the past but “rather to serve certain imminent political aims in the present or some particular design for the future.”71 In Hattušili III’s Apology there is a reference to Ištar-Šauška sending a dream oracle through Muwatalli, the eldest son of Muršili II, as an expression of divine support for Hattušili III’s claim to rulership:
§ 1 (Col. i:1‒4) Thus Tabarna Hattušili (III), Great King, King of Hatti, son of Muršili (II), Great King, King of Hatti, grandson of Šuppiluliuma, Great King, King of Hatti, descendant of Hattušili (I), King of Kuššar.

(Now), Ištar, my Lady, sent Muwatalli, my brother to Muršili, my father, through a dream (saying): “For Hattušili (III) the years (are) short, he is not to live (long). Hand him over to me, and let him be my priest, so he (will) live.” My father took me up, (while still) a boy, and handed me (over) to the service of the goddess, and as a priest I brought offerings to the goddess. At the hand of Ištar, My Lady, I experienced prosperity, and Ištar, My Lady, took me by the hand and provided for me.72
Hattušili III had been the youngest of four children and of fragile health,73 which helps explain why he was initially assigned as a priest to the goddess Ištar. Later, when he had become king, he would constantly turn to her for guidance:
(i:51‒60) In times of fear the goddess, My Lady, never abandoned me, neither to my enemy nor to my opponent or rival did she ever leave me. Whether it was some word from an enemy, from an opponent in court, or from the palace circle, Ištar, My lady shielded

me in every way, favored me, and delivered enemies and rivals into my hands, for me to finish them off.
As is clear from several oracles,74 toward the end of his reign King Hattušili III decided to install his son Tudhaliya IV as co-regent in order to secure his line of succession and to prevent Kurunta, his nephew and the King of Tarhuntaša, from seizing the throne of Hattuša.75 The close relationship between Ištar and the king and the reliance on oracular inquiry to legitimize royal action in the context of succession reemerge in the late Sargonid period, as both Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal are younger sons of the king who are appointed as successors to the throne.
9.4 Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice and his Reformulation of the Assyrian Rules of Succession
9.4.1 Esarhaddon’s Rise to Power
Although the Hittite evidence precedes Esarhaddon by five hundred years, Esarhaddon’s decision to favor his younger son Ashurbanipal in the succession to the throne while making his elder son Šamaš-šum-ukīn governor of Babylonia closely parallels the Hittite precedent. It is possible that Hattušili III’s Apology survived into the Sargonid period – not so much as a text but as a cultural discourse or practice that persisted within international cultural memory and served as a model for Esarhaddon, who then framed his own accession to the throne in a similar discourse. In contrast to Hattušili III, however, Esarhaddon does not rely on dream oracles but on prophecy. Oracles, mostly spoken by Ištar, were collected together on tablets in order to articulate a narrative that justified Esarhaddon’s plans for the irregular appointment of his younger son Ashurbanipal as crown prince designate. The fact that it is Ištar who represents the divine protagonist in this divine-human communication among both Hittites and Assyrians constitutes further evidence of the intense cultural interaction between Hittite and Assyrian scholarly circles in the Middle Assyrian period.
74 Though not necessarily prophecies, as the oracles are referred to as KIN-oracles (see van den Hout 1991), which are to be linked with extispicy. 75 Van den Hout 1991. The prayers of Hattušili III and Paduhepa to the sun goddess of Arinna confirm the narrative of the apology, see Sürenhagen 1981.



342 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
In his pioneering study of Esarhaddon’s Apology, which constitutes the introductory section to the longest historical prism inscription from Nineveh (Nineveh A now RINAP 4 no. 1), Hayim Tadmor defined the text as an “unusual literary form” expressing an “equally unusual political situation,”76 namely the deliberate failure to abide by the norm of primogeniture. Esarhaddon came to power during the civil war that broke out after the murder of his father Sennacherib (704‒681 BCE).77 Esarhaddon’s succession has been the subject of extensive recent research,78 so I will only reflect on those points that contribute to an understanding of the arrangement of the oracle collections. As Barbara Porter79 has demonstrated, it is very difficult to reconstruct the events surrounding Esarhaddon’s rise to power because very few of his father Sennacherib’s inscriptions survive from the late years of his reign. Those that do survive focus primarily on the destruction of Babylon, his raid against the Arabs, and the building of the festival house in Aššur. Nevertheless, the barrel cylinder commemorating the construction of Esarhaddon’s succession palace in Aššur and the Gift of Sennacherib for Esarhaddon80 – which mentions Esarhaddon’s throne name Aššur-eṭellu-mukîn-apli clearly testify to Sennacherib’s intention to install Esarhaddon as his successor to the throne.81 Furthermore, a fragment of a loyalty oath may very well have recorded arrangements for Esarhaddon’s appointment as crown prince, though his name is not preserved.82 Such arrangements were necessary because, although it is not stated officially in any surviving text, the eldest son normally inherited the throne.83 When royal succession did not comply with the norm of primogeniture, as is the case with Esarhaddon and his successor Ashurbanipal, this was cause for extensive justification in the royal inscriptions of these kings. The principle of primogeniture is also clearly expressed in the following statement of one of Esarhaddon’s advisers, recorded in a letter:

Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice 343
What has not been done in heaven, the king, my lord, has done upon earth and shown us: you have girded a son of yours with headband and entrusted him kingship of Assyria; your eldest son you have put (up) to the kingship in Babylon.84
Overruling the principle of primogeniture had to be legitimized through specific cultural practices in order for the new king to secure the loyalty of his contemporaries and the acceptance of future generations, which can explain the unusual text of Esarhaddon’s Apology and the compilation of oracle collections. It is not entirely clear if Sennacherib originally expected his eldest son Aššur-nādin-šumi to succeed him to the throne; it is also unclear if Aššur-nādin-šumi’s installation as governor of Babylonia was intended to prepare him for future kingship in Assyria,85 or whether this arrangement was intended to be permanent. The latter is assumed by Kwasman and Parpola on the basis of certain documents that mention Sennacherib’s other son Urda-Mullissi both by name and by the title mār šarri, indicating the king’s intention to install him as his heir to the throne.86 Aššur-nādin-šumi was killed in a conspiracy of the Babylonians and Elamites, which eventually led to Sennacherib’s devastating destruction of Babylon. Around 698 BCE Sennacherib appears to have designated his second son Urda-Mullissi as his successor to the throne, and it seems that Urda-Mullissi held this position for over a dozen years until his sudden and enforced resignation in 684 BCE. The reasons for Urda-Mullissi’s dismissal are unknown. It is likely that Sennacherib’s powerful wife Naqia had something to do with it,87 convincing him to install his younger son Esarhaddon (her son, too) as crown prince and heir apparent in the year 683 BCE. Esarhaddon would not ordinarily have been next in line for the succession, as he states in his Apology: “I am my older brother’s youngest brother.”88 Even before Sen
84 SAA 10 no. 185; pace Radner 2003, 166 who concludes on this basis that the king could choose his successor from among all males of the royal line and that there was no established custom of primogeniture. See further the example of Tiglath-Pileser III, who, although a member of the royal family, was not the designated heir and usurped the throne. It is probably for this reason that he avoids including his filiation in his inscriptions, see most recently Tadmor and Yamada in the introduction to RINAP 1, 12. In Mesopotamia norms of succession appear to have varied according to time and place, Heimpel 1992. 85 A different view is presented by Frahm 1997, 19 who contends that Sennacherib installed his first-born son Aššur-nādin-šumi as governor in Babylon and his second son Urda-mullissi as crown prince and heir apparent; the latter was demoted in 683 BCE in favor of Esarhaddon. Frahm does express doubt about this, however, as a relief from Lachish shows the king in the company of a crown prince already in 701. 86 Kwasman and Parpola SAA 6, XXXII‒XXXIV. 87 Melville 1999 downplays the role of Naqia. 88 Porter 1993, 16 and RINAP 4 no. 1 i 8.

nacherib’s murder – probably at the hands of the unhappy Urda-Mullissi89
Esarhaddon had to confront the conflicting factions struggling for power in
Assyria. Sennacherib sent Esarhaddon to the Western frontier, perhaps in order
to keep him safe from such infighting; it should be noted that Esarhaddon’s
claim to have been the beneficiary of this kind of protection from his father is
unique in Assyrian-Babylonian history and raises some doubts about the actual
relationship between Sennacherib and Esarhaddon. It is, however, from the
Western frontier that Esarhaddon would eventually make his way through
Hanigalbat toward Nineveh to take the throne. Erle Leichty has recently argued
persuasively that Esarhaddon might have reconsolidated his forces in Harran,
which could be the Sargonid dynasty’s original home.90
In the introduction to Esarhaddon’s Apology – written long after Esarhad
don’s succession to the throne in 673 BCE in order to justify his decision to
appoint Ashurbanipal as his successor91 – Esarhaddon refers to the two impor
tant stages of his own rise to power, namely his appointment as crown prince
in the month Nisannu of the year 683 BCE92 and his ascension to the throne on
the 18th of Addaru (XII) 680 BCE. These two dates frame the civil war period
described at length in his Apology. Esarhaddon’s Apology is strikingly similar to
the oracle collections from his reign, and both are deeply concerned with the
period of civil war that followed Esarhaddon’s appointment as crown prince.
Furthermore, the Apology argues that the gods favored the kingship of Esarhad
don over that of his brothers: favorable omens and oracles confirm Sennacher
ib’s preference for Esarhaddon and his elevation to the status of crown prince
designate is presented as the implementation of divine will.93 The political mes
sage of Esarhaddon’s Apology is further strengthened by his unusual self-intro
duction, which, unlike the royal genealogies typical of the titulary at the begin
ning of royal inscriptions, stresses the question of divine election (i 5‒7). More
over, intertextual connections with mythic texts like Lugal-e, the Erra Epic, and
89 Parpola 1980. 90 Leichty 2007. This argument is supported not only by the fact that three kings have theophoric names with the divine element Sîn and that Sîn figures prominently in their royal inscriptions (so Leichty), but also by the fact that the queen mother Naqia is represented holding a mirror in her hand, a motif typical of Syro-Anatolian representation (Parrot and Nougayrol 1956. 91 Tadmor 1983, 37; Parpola, SAA 9, LXIX‒LXX; Nissinen 1998, 15. 92 For the date of Esarhaddon’s appointment as crown prince see Kwasman and Parpola SAA 6, XXXIII‒XXXIV and Nissinen 1998, 18. 93 See the quotation of the relevant passage in Chapter 8.1.

the royal inscriptions of his predecessors Sargon II and Sennacherib94 serve to bolster Esarhaddon’s arguments and to justify his political actions.
9.4.2 Esarhaddon’s Oracle Collections
The prophecies recorded in Esarhaddon’s reign represent an important addition to the discussion of the literarization of particular royal agendas. Sargonid scholarly tradition maintained two basic formats for the transmission of prophetic reports: the horizontal format of the uʾiltu and the vertical format of the ṭuppu. Tablets with a horizontal format dealt with notes, omen reports, receipts, etc., and were disposable, while the ṭuppu format, on the contrary, was used for treaties, census lists, balance accounts, treasury inventories, royal decrees and ordinances,95 lexical lists, and literary texts, and was designed for archival storage. Neo-Assyrian prophecies have been found in both formats, with single reports in the libraries of Nineveh being recorded in the uʾiltu format and oracle collections in the multi-column ṭuppu format. Karel van der Toorn stresses the enduring significance of the Neo-Assyrian oracle collections,96 which are the subject of the following discussion. Much information can be gleaned from the format and formulation of these tablets. First, Simo Parpola has made the critical observation that, judging from sign forms and other scribal idiosyncracies, all the single oracle reports were written by different scribal hands, while the four oracle collections were all compiled by the same scribe.97 Second, the single oracle reports usually begin with a brief note introducing the oracle, sometimes specifying its origin, context, or date, such as “the word of Ištar of Arbela [to the king’s mother ...];”98 “the prophetess Mullissu-kabtat (has said);”99 or “words [concerning the Elam]ites.”100 In the oracle collections of the multi-column tablets these “notes follow the oracle and are rigorously standardized,”101 while “the individual oracles on the tablet and the authorship indications following them

are separated from each other by a horizontal ruling.”102 Third, each oracle collection was originally preceded by an introductory section. In the second column of the first collection this section consists of ten lines now completely lost, which are separated from a postscript by a double ruling that is in turn separated by a single ruling from the corpus of the oracles that follow. In the third oracle collection, the introductory section probably included a statement about Esarhaddon’s success in stabilizing his rule over Assyria, as expressed in the formulas of a declarative speech act: “Heaven and earth are [well]; Ešarra is [wel]l; Esarhaddon, king of Assyria is [well].”103 Subsequently, the text seems to refer to a ritual performance in the Aššur temple, which is signaled by statements like “before Aššur” and “they come” and “burn (aromatics).” Why should one distinguish between the tablets carrying single reports and the multi-column oracle collections? For the most part, prophecy, “from the view of the communication process, does not presuppose any literary activity at all.”104 Because the king was not present when oracles were taken, however, the divine message needed to be written down to ensure effective transmission; this is the purpose of the uʾiltu format.105 Simply committing an oracle to writing involved the use of a refined literary form that was not only “adjusted to necessary scribal conventions and stylized according to the prevailing customs”106 but also aimed at intelligibility, so that the oracular message could be readily understood by its recipient, in most cases the Neo-Assyrian king.107 In this context, standardized introductory formulas and subscripts facilitated the identification of the origin of the oracle as well its mediator. The formulaic framework used to transmit the message in writing is, consequently, comparable to that of astrological reports or omen reports.108 While the uʾiltu format has the character of a disposable document not necessarily intended for longterm preservation, “the ṭuppu format, in contrast, is intentionally designed for archival storage.”109 This suggests that oracle collections were designed to be preserved for posterity.

Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice 347
As compilations on multi-column tablets, the oracle collections represent a new literary format. This format can be counted among the other new text categories that emerged under Esarhaddon, like his Apology,110 or among text categories that became more prominent during the Sargonid period, like Royal Reports justifying exceptional royal actions. Fratricide, for instance, forms the background for Esarhaddon’s report on his campaign to Šubria,111 which, although not overtly stated, was intended to justify the murder of his brother Urda-Mullisi and his followers, whose claim to the Assyrian throne threatened Esarhaddon’s succession. Divine Letters were also part of this intense literary production and are represented by texts like Ashurbanipal’s Fictive Dialogue between Ashurbanipa and Nabûl,112 and Aššur’s Letter to Ashurbanipal,113 which sanctions the king’s killing of his brother Šamaš-šum-ukīn, the governor of Babylon. Although the oracle collections share in the historical argument advanced by these various texts, they should be approached in the broader context of literary creations linked to Esarhaddon’s decision to appoint his younger son Ashurbanipal as his successor to the throne. The oracle collections read like an abbreviated version of his Apology, which describes his rise to power and was written long after his ascension to the throne. Simo Parpola has proposed this interpretation for the first oracle collection, which deals with the decisive battle before Esarhaddon’s arrival at Nineveh in the eleventh month of 681 BCE and his ultimate triumph one month later (681‒XII‒8). Parpola dates the first oracle collection to late 673 BCE, i.e. the same time the Apology was composed, while suggesting the earlier date of 679 BCE for the second collection, which relates to Esarhaddon’s difficulties in consolidating his power in the early years of his reign. Parpola suggests a date in the last days of 681 or early 680 BCE for the third collection because it contains oracles concerned with Esarhaddon’s covenant with Aššur. I disagree with Parpola’s dating of the third oracle collection since oracle SAA 9 no. 3.2 lists the various enemies that Esarhaddon confronted during his reign, like the Cimmerians and the king of Melid, and because of the retrospective voice of the Aššur oracle SAA 9 no. 3.3. I suggest instead that the compilation of the third oracle collection and its deposition alongside the first and second oracle collections was a consequence of a concerted effort to articulate a coherent narrative about these events toward the

348 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
end of Esarhaddon’s reign.114 It is also possible to assume that a Vorlage informed the particular wording of the respective oracle collections, explaining their slight differences and preventing the author from composing a unified “literary” version of the three collections.
9.4.3 Rewriting History through the Voices of Ištar and Aššur
The first two of Esarhaddon’s oracle collections, assembled either on threecolumn or two-column tablets, refer to historical events linked with Esarhaddon’s installation as crown prince, the ensuing civil war, his enthronement, and several episodes from the beginning of his reign. The third oracle collection, by contrast, summarizes the events tied directly to Esarhaddon’s rise to power and stands out for its inclusion of a retrospective oracle spoken by Aššur rather than Ištar. The assemblage of the oracles on the multi-column tablets is not random, but roughly follows the course of the events they describe. As a result, the content of the oracles can be read as a “narrative” of Esarhaddon’s ascension to the throne authorized by the divine voice. This narrative is also communicated in Esarhaddon’s royal inscriptions, particularly in his Apology from Nineveh. The “narrative” framework relating to Esarhaddon’s rise to power is, however, interspersed with oracles pertaining to political and military events from later in his reign (see especially SAA 9 no. 2.4 and 3.2). It is precisely this chronologically unsound fusion that complicates our understanding of the function of the oracle collections and – to my mind – precludes dating them to the beginning of Esarhaddon’s reign.115 In other words, the single oracles were originally spoken early in Esarhaddon’s reign, when he was struggling to consolidate his power in Assyria. These oracles were not, however, assembled in the three collective tablets stored together in the libraries of Nineveh until later; their assembly was likely intended to legitimize Esarhaddon’s reign and probably dates to the time when Esarhaddon planned to install his younger son Ashurbanipal as heir to the throne. A survey of the chain of events presented in the “narrative” of these tablets can help illuminate their purpose. The first oracle collection, identified by Simo Parpola as the “Oracles of Encouragement to Esarhaddon,” pertains to the peri
114 I thank Simo Parpola for the conversation we had on the subject on August 29th, 2012. 115 Pace Weippert 1981, 95‒96. Parpola, SAA 9, LXVIII points out that the references to Elam, Mannea, Urartu and Mugallu of Melid could, in principle, belong to any phase of Esarhaddon’s twelve-year reign.



Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice 349
od of Esarhaddon’s absence from Assyria, when his father Sennacherib had sent him away to protect him from assassination, as is expressed by the following oracle:
King of Assyria, have no fear! I will deliver up the enemy of the king of Assyria for slaughter. [I will] keep you safe and [make] you [great in] your Palace of Succession.116
Further support is provided by the oracle delivered to the Queen Mother:
I am the Lady of Arbela. To the king’s mother: Because you implored me, saying: You have placed the ones at the (king’s) right and left side in your lap, but made my own offspring roam in the steppe” Now fear not, my king! The kingdom is yours, yours is the power!117
The tablet seems to end with Esarhaddon’s safe arrival at the succession palace, as is mentioned in his Apology.118 In the last oracle of the collection, Ištar tells Esarhaddon that just as he relied on her previous oracles, so too can he rely on her present and future oracles:
[I am the Lady of Arb]ela. [O Esarhaddon, who]se bosom [Ištar] of Arbela has filled with favor! Could you not rely on the previous utterance which I spoke to you? Now you can rely on this later one too.119
Esarhaddon’s inscriptions do not refer explicitly to Ištar’s oracles in favor of his installation as crown prince, but her support for the future king is mentioned in his Apology, which refers to her intervention with the expression “through her sublime command”:
Fear of the great gods, my lords, overwhelmed them, (and when) they saw my mighty battle array, they became like crazed women. The goddess Ištar, the lady of war and battle, who loves my priesthood, stood at my side, broke their bows, (and) she split open their tight battle ranks. In their assembly, they said thus: “This is our king!” Through her sublime command they began coming over to my side (and) marching behind me. They were gamboling like lambs (and) begging my sovereignty.120
The second oracle collection deals with Esarhaddon’s efforts to consolidate his power. Unfortunately, the introduction is missing and the surviving text begins

350 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
with the oracles themselves. In the first oracle, Ištar’s promise to guide Esarhaddon’s reign according to the ideal model of the past frames the collection as a whole:
[Have no fe]ar, Esarhaddon! [Like a] skilled pilot [I will st]eer [the ship] into a good port. [The fu]ture [shall] be like the past; [I will go around you and protect you.121
The oracles, cast in beautiful metaphors, repeatedly evoke Esarhaddon’s difficulties in consolidating his kingship. They refer to rival claimants to the throne and to foreign enemies hoping to exploit Assyria’s political instability in order to destroy Assyria:
I will [reconcile] Assyria with you. I will protect [you] by day and by dawn and [consolidate] your crown. Like a winged bird ov[er its young] I will twitter over you and go in circles around you. Like a beautiful (lion) cub I will run about in your palace and sniff out your enemies. I will keep you safe in your palace; I will make you overcome anxiety and trembling. Your son and grandson shall rule as kings before Ninurta. I will abolish the frontiers of all the lands and give them to you. Mankind is deceitful; I am one who says and does. I will sniff out, catch and give you the ‘noisy daughter’.122
Another oracle relates to the military challenges that Esarhaddon faced in his later years:
I will choose the emissaries of the Elamites and the Mannean. I will seal the writings of the Urartian. I will cut off the ... of Mugallu (of Melitene). Who (then) is the lone man? Who is the wronged man? Have no fear! Well sheltered is Esarhaddon, king of Assyria.123
The major task faced by Esarhaddon during his reign was to allay the hostilities between Assyria and Babylonia, which culminated in several Babylonian revolts and in Sennacherib’s final punitive destruction of Babylon and deportation of its citizens. It therefore comes as no surprise that the support of the Babylonian gods for Esarhaddon’s rule was also confirmed in the oracles:
The gods of Esangil languish in the ‘steppe’ of mixed evil. Quickly let two burnt offerings be sent out to their presence, and let them go and announce your well-being!124

Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice 351
The last oracle of the second collection, again unfortunately fragmentary, refers to Babylon and to Urkittu, Ištar’s hypostasis in Uruk in Southern Babylonia.125 Letters sent to Esarhaddon toward the end of his reign relate to the restoration of temples and statues in Uruk, which explains Urkittu’s presence in the oracles.126 Further historical allusions include the references to the Elamites and Manneans, to the sealing of the writing of the Urartian, and to Mugallu of Melitene, who remained an enemy throughout Esarhaddon’s entire reign and who is mentioned in the queries to the Sun God.127 A campaign against Mugallu is attested as late as Esarhaddon’s sixth year in Elulu 675 BCE128 and probably took place after Esarhaddon’s campaign against the Manneans earlier in the same year.129 As such, the timeframe covered in the second oracle collection stretches from the beginning of Esarhaddon’s reign to just after its midpoint, and includes activities in a geographical expanse stretching between some of the southernmost and some of the northernmost extremities of Esarhaddon’s empire at that time. Both the first and the second oracle collections contain oracles spoken by Ištar or other gods130 in promissory and commissive speech acts that express divine commitment to the king in highly particular situations. The third oracle collection stands apart from the other two in three respects: its overall composition, the fact that the first two oracles are delivered by Aššur instead of Ištar, and the fact that Aššur’s oracles are spoken in the past tense. This change in divine authority and in the use of tenses shapes the overall content of the message and should serve as a caution against reading the oracle collections as a simple secondary recording of formerly single oracles. On the contrary, the complexity of their composition demonstrates that much more was involved than mere recording and copying. The third collection begins with a general introductory statement regarding Esarhaddon’s final victory over his brothers and the consequent promotion of prosperity in the land, which is expressed in the well-being of Heaven and Earth, the Aššur temple, and the king. This presentation of Esarhaddon’s rise to power is concluded by a blessing and followed by a ritual description of a

ceremony in the Aššur temple involving the burning (of aromatics) and a reference to the king’s mother. Simo Parpola tentatively reconstructed one verbal form as [... i-n]a-áš-ši “he lifts up”, which in the royal rituals generally refers to lifting up the crown of Aššur and the weapons of Mullissu.131 Mention of the king’s mother, however, suggests that the context of the coronation ceremony is unlikely in this case. After a ruling, two oracles spoken by Aššur follow.132 These oracles state that the king’s victory was achieved with the support of Aššur, but their form is distinct from that of other oracles: they lack any address to the king or selfrepresentation of the deity, features typical of the oracles spoken by Ištar. The first oracle refers to Esarhaddon’s victorious reign, which secured his control over the entire universe from East to West. Instead of delivering a situational prediction, it summarizes the achievements of Esarhaddon. By contrast, the middle section of the oracle consists of a “victory oracle”133 “predicting” Esarhaddon’s future conquest of Melid (Melitene), the Cimmerians, and the Ellipi:
[List]en, O Assyrians! [The king] has vanquished his enemy. [You]r [king] has put his enemy [under] his foot, [from] sun[se]t [to] sun[ris]e, [from] sun[ris]e to sun[se]t! I will destroy [Meli]d, [I will de]stroy [...], [I will ...],
I will deliver the Cimmerians into his hands and set the land of Ellipi on fire. Aššur has given the totality of the four regions to him. From sunrise to sunset there is no king equal to him; he shines as brilliantly as the sun. This is the (oracle of) well-being placed before Bel-Tarbaṣi and the gods.134
The joint reference to the Cimmerians and Ellipi locates the text in the year 670 BCE, when a number of queries to the sun god speak of an Assyrian campaign against Ellipi.135 Furthermore, a letter of Marduk-šakin-šumi to Esarhaddon mentions the triumphal procession of Esarhaddon into the city of Arbail following his victory over the Cimmerians, which can again be dated firmly to the year 670 BCE.136
131 See his commentary for SAA 9, 22. 132 I follow the suggestion made by Martti Nissinen 2000b, 252 fn. 62 and understand Aššur to be the sender of the first oracle too. 133 Van der Toorn 1987. 134 SAA 9 no. 3:2:i 28‒ ii 8. 135 SAA 4 nos. 76‒79.

Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice 353
Aššur’s second oracle of salvation (šulmu) constitutes the climax of divine speech in favor of the Assyrian king. It summarizes the political challenges Esarhaddon faced during the civil war in the past tense and emphatically affirms the Assyrian supreme god’s support for Esarhaddon:
Now then, these traitors provoked you, had you banished, and surrounded you; but you opened your mouth (and cried): “Hear me, O Aššur!” I heard your cry. I issued forth as a fiery glow from the gate of heaven, to hurl down fire and have it devour them. You were standing in their midst, so I removed them from your presence. I drove them up the mountain and rained (hail)stones and fire of heaven upon them. I slaughtered your enemies and filled the river with their blood. Let them see (it) and praise me, (knowing) that I am Aššur, lord of the gods. This is the well-being (placed) before the Image. This covenant tablet of Aššur enters the king’s presence on a cushion. Fragrant oil is sprinkled, sacrifices are made, incense is burnt, and they read it out in the king’s presence.137
The first “oracle” of Aššur presents a mixture of two different speech acts: the modus declarativus stating Esarhaddon’s past achievements is combined with a promissory statement “predicting” future victories that had actually already been achieved. The second oracle, by contrast, establishes a fictive dialogue between Aššur and the king that recalls Aššur’s support for Esarhaddon in his moment of crisis. The form and performative situation of this oracle can be regarded as a precursor of the Fictive Dialogue between King Ashurbanipal and Nabû,138 a text category that in my view emerged out of the secondary textualization of prophecy as represented in the oracle collections. Both oracles have postscripts that record where they were placed: before Bēl-Tarbaṣi at the entrance gate of Ešarra in the first case, and in the main cella in front of the image, probably of Aššur, in the second case.139 According to the Divine Directory from Aššur (the so-called Götteradressbuch), the god Bēl-Tarbaṣi is one of the guardians of the gates of the Aššur-Temple Ešarra.140 Consequently, the tablet placed before Bēl-Tarbaṣi – if visible – would have guaranteed the dissemination of the divine word at least among those allowed to enter the temple district; this is much less true for the second oracle, which
137 SAA 9 no. 3.3:ii 10‒27. 138 SAA 3 no. 13. 139 These postscripts are nominal sentences annû šulmu ša ina pān ṣalme “This is the wellbeing (oracle) (placed) before the Image,” which prompted Weippert to assume that the oracle was “spoken” in front of the image. I prefer the approach suggested by Simo Parpola. 140 Menzel 1981 vol. 2, T 149:45.



354 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
was placed in the relatively inaccessible cella. The placement of the tablets in front of the divine statue, a custom well-known for treaty tablets in Hittite and Assyrian contexts,141 points to the importance ascribed to Aššur’s oracles and invests them with enduring legal meaning. In the second oracle, the postscript records ritual instructions similar to those associated with ritual readings of the loyalty oath before the king. This passage has been understood as a reference to the first Aššur oracle,142 and induced Simo Parpola to name the third oracle collection as a whole “The Covenant of Aššur.” Scholarship dealing with the study of the Neo-Assyrian oracles has followed this interpretation and the first two oracles have thus been read in the context of Esarhaddon’s ascension to the throne.143 In what kind of ritual context, however, would Aššur’s oracle have been set, and must it be related to Esarhaddon’s ascension? As stated above, Esarhaddon’s ascension to the throne was framed by two steps: (1) the ceremonial swearing of loyalty oaths while Sennacherib was still alive, and (2) Esarhaddon’s actual enthronement following his expulsion of rival claimants to the throne, probably to Urartu or Šubria.144 The only two Assyrian ritual texts dealing with the enthronement of the king, namely the Middle Assyrian coronation ritual145 and the Coronation Hymn to Ashurbanipal,146 indicate that the coronation of kings took place in the Aššur temple. Neither text mentions the performance of a loyalty oath. Also problematic is the fact that the texts of loyalty oaths performed by the officials and vassals of the Assyrian empire do not record any ritual prescriptions that shed light on the procedure of oath-swearing. The oracle collection SAA 9.3 is, indeed, the only Assyrian text that mentions the ritual reading of an oath (ṭuppi adê) before the king in the Aššur temple. SAA 9.3 is also the only Assyrian text to mention a covenant meal, which follows the ritual reading of the oath and is separated from the preceding Aššur oracles by a double ruling. This scribal demarcation indicates both that the oracles that follow it were spoken by Ištar and that the covenant meal itself was not considered part of the oath-reading ceremony. Further, the oath-reading
141 See now the evidence of Tell Taynat, which also includes an exorcistic tablet. In the Old Babylonian period letter prayers might have been subject to deposition of this kind. 142 Weippert 2002, 17 considers the entirety of the first part to represent three oracles spoken by Aššur, which are then separated from Ištar’s oracle by a double ruling. 143 Otto 1998, 80‒84 and 1999; Nissinen 2000. 251 ff. 144 Leichty 1991. 145 Müller 1957. 146 SAA 3 no. 11.



Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice 355
ceremony before the king in the Aššur temple should be distinguished from the oath-swearing that accompanied the installation of a new crown prince. This oath was probably sworn in the Nabû temple147 in the presence of Marduk and Nabû, as mentioned in a letter sent to king Esarhaddon regarding Ashurbanipal’s appointment as crown prince:
The scribes of the cities of Nin[eveh], Kilizi and Arbela (could) ent[er] the treaty; they have (already) come. (However), those of Aššur [have] not (yet) come. The king, my lord, [knows] that they are cler[gymen]148. If it pleases the king my lord, let the former, who have (already) come, enter the treaty; the citizens of Nineveh and Calaḫ would be free soon (and) could enter (the treaty/loyalty oath) under (the statues of) the gods Bēl and Nabû on the 8th day.149
Although the above passage refers to Ashurbanipal’s installation as crown prince, it is probably safe to assume that similar procedures were in place when Sennacherib appointed Esarhaddon as his crown prince. Ashurbanipal’s appointment as crown prince coincided with the Babylonian akītu festival,150 which could also account for the oath-swearing in the presence of the gods Marduk and Nabû. If we assume that the ṭuppi adê of SAA 9.3 refers to the swearing of loyalty oaths rather than to oracles spoken by Aššur, then to my knowledge this constitutes the only evidence for the swearing of loyalty oaths on the occasion of the king’s coronation in the Aššur temple. On the other hand, numerous sources attest to oath-swearing on the occasion of the appointment of the crown prince. There is another possible interpretation: similar to earlier practices among the Hittites, previously sworn loyalty oaths could have been read again at certain intervals in the presence not only of the magnates and vassals but also of the Assyrian king himself. If so, the loyalty oath could have been sworn both upon Esarhaddon’s ascension to the throne and at a later point in his reign. The subsequent oracle spoken by Ištar elevates the swearing of the loyalty oath to the divine level, as the treaty parties are represented by the gods. Accordingly, the oracle presents a literary reading of political events during the swearing of the loyalty oath:

356 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
Come, gods, my fathers and brothers, [enter] the cove[nant ....] [She placed] a slice ... on the [ter]race and gave them water from a cooler to drink. She filled a flagon of one seah with water from the cooler and gave it to them with the words: “in your hearts you say, ‘Ištar is slight,’ and you will go to your cities and districts, eat (your) bread and forget this covenant. “(But when) you drink from this water, you will remember me and keep this covenant which I have made on behalf of Esarhaddon.”151
Although Aššur’s oracles may originally have had a ritual setting that included a reading to the king, their secondary textualization in the collective tablets did not. The other important question is how to reconcile the references to political and military undertakings from much later in Esarhaddon’s reign with the oracles spoken on the occasion of his appointment to the office of crown prince. This is the heart of the problem, as not one of the “historical oracles” in the third oracle collection can be read as a situational oracle simply because all of these historical allusions appear as listings of various historical episodes rather than as detailed accounts of oracular deliveries. If we take the formal presentation of the historical references seriously, the second oracle collection would only have been written in the second half of Esarhaddon’s reign, at some point after 675 BCE, while the third would have been written toward the end of Esarhaddon’s reign, around 670 BCE – a date that is closer in time to Ashurbanipal’s coronation than to his installation as crown prince, which had already taken place in 672 BCE. Of interest in this respect is the fact that the year 670 BCE is notorious for Esarhaddon’s slaughter of numerous magnates and officials, who had engaged in a conspiracy against the king. This event is recorded in the Babylonian Chronicle152 and anticipated in a letter of one of Esarhaddon’s spies,153 as well as in queries to the Sun God inquiring about the loyalty of official and magnates154 and ‘appointment queries’155 reflecting a situation of political tension and denunciation. Could it be that Esarhaddon intended to create a visionary framework for Ashurbanipal’s coronation by using the retrodictive oracles spoken by Aššur in the third oracle collection? The fact that these oracles evoke the state procedure of the loyalty oath and the covenant meal to protect Ashurbanipal from

Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice 357
harm by means of some kind of ‘performative magic’156 certainly seems to aim at influencing the course of events while simultaneously emphasizing contemporaneous political ethical conventions. Read from this perspective, the oracle collections as a text category share features with the so-called literary predictive texts,157 such as the Marduk Prophecy, Šulgi Prophecy, Dynastic Chronicle, and Uruk Prophecy.158 These literary predictive texts consist of a number of “‘predictions’ of past events,” socalled vaticinia ex eventu that were “carefully selected for their illustrative value and assembled into a dramatic progression of cycles of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ heralding the establishment of a final era of bliss.”159 The purpose of these predictions is to vindicate this final era and to legitimize the present, a situation that well describes the historical context and general message of the NeoAssyrian oracle collections. These literary predictive texts have no prophetic or cultic setting160 but emerged from the context of historiographic writing. The Neo-Assyrian oracle collections differ from the literary predictive texts insofar as they are explicit about historical events and do not cover the vast temporal and spatial scope typical of the literary predictive texts. Nonetheless, because of their literary affinities to divine letters, literary predictive texts, and the fictive dialogue, the secondary textualization of the Neo-Assyrian oracles belongs to the broader historiographic productivity of the Sargonid period. Instead of viewing the oracles as a simple “collection,” their compositional outline suggests a reading that transcends the historical circumstances that elicited their first formulation.161 The exemplary character of the oracles also anticipates the future appointment of Esarhaddon’s younger son Ashurbanipal. Rather than legitimizing Esarhaddon’s reign, the oracle collections trace his ascension to the throne and thus produce a model of irregular succession that can be repeated again in the future. Ashurbanipal’s royal authority and his claim to power are thus anchored in the divine sanction of Esarhaddon’s rise to power, and a divinely approved precedent is established for deviation from the tradition of primogeniture. Simo Parpola suggests relating the first oracle collection to the historiographic context of Esarhaddon’s Apology in his Nineveh inscription from 673 BCE and assumes that the second collection concerned with the stabilization

358 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
of Esarhaddon’s rule was written in the year 679 BCE, i.e. the same date as the Aššur A inscription; Parpola regards the third collection as the earliest one, dating it to the last days of 681 or 680 BCE.162 While Parpola’s reconstruction may well be accurate, the question remains as to whether a gap of six years should be postulated between the writing of the first and the writing of the third collection, as the tablets were written by the same hand. Like divine letters, these oracle collections were designed to extend divine approval to certain historical events. Divine letters repeat a narrative about the decisive stages of one of the king’s military campaigns and intersperse the erstwhile royal report with legitimizing formulae, wherein the deeds of the king are presented as taking place at the command of the god and buttressed with sanctifying formulae.163 In the oracle collections, divine speech repeats a narrative concerning certain key moments in Esarhaddon’s rise to power and imposes a particular interpretation of them that then determines how these events will be understood by posterity. This retrospective perspective is further supported by the fact that the oracles always refer to Esarhaddon as “king” (šarru) and never as “crown prince,” a fact that has not hitherto been taken into consideration. The ṭuppu format of the tablets was supposed to emphasize the judicial force of the content, as this same format was used for treaties and other legal documents and conveyed binding authority.164 As is the case in Esarhaddon’s Apology, the argument of the oracle collections is that Esarhaddon’s accession was well grounded in legal state procedure.165 As such, the oracle collections could serve as an exemplary precedent for Ashurbanipal and help suppress another potential crisis. Through the oracle collections, the particular moment in Assyrian history when Esarhaddon was installed as crown prince (mār šarri ša bīt rēdûti) despite being a younger son was presented as conforming to tradition. This effect was brought about by reliance on the key strategy of Mesopotamian culture, namely divine speech, which offered a range of culturally established associations that condensed and established meaning.166 With their binding and authoritative force,167 the oracle collections in their written form were meant to transform the perception of the events
162 Parpola, SAA 9, LXVIII f. 163 Pongratz-Leisten 1999, 266‒275, esp. 272. 164 In this context we can refer to the formula “According to the command of Anu and Antu, may [this endeavor] be successful!” This wish expresses the hope of the scribe that his work will be pleasing to the gods and is used in Seleucid Uruk and Babylon in legal contexts and for scientific texts, see Pearce 2004, 628. 165 Tadmor 1983, 39. 166 Pongratz-Leisten 2012. 167 On the power of the divine word see Noegel 2004.



Esarhaddon’s Reliance on Ištar’s Voice 359
surrounding Esarhaddon’s rise to power and thus functioned as a model case for the future selection of Ashurbanipal as crown prince. By means of the divine voice, the oracle collections concerned with legitimizing irregular succession gain the same divinely determined character as the Tablet of Destinies: they impose the concept of cosmic order articulated by the gods while transcending a particular historical event and using it to establish a new paradigm of succession. The oracle collections can be seen as a first step in the literary development towards prophetic historiography.168 As text categories, both the oracle collection and the aforementioned fictive dialogue that grew out of the textualization of prophecy were not part of the common literary repertoire. Although the oracle collection and the fictive dialogue were linked intertextually to other existing text categories, they emerged in historical situations of crisis169 and were exceptional in their form, content, and function. The fictive dialogue and the oracle collection both drew on the familiar structures and content of oracles in order to transpose and actualize the textual repertoire in a new literary framework, creating a message that does not address the king in a specific historical situation but is directed instead at posterity. By means of this new compositional framework, such texts compel the audience to engage in a dynamic and new reception of customary strategies of discourse. What remains to be determined is whether the oracle collections are addressed to a particular audience and if so, who that audience might have been. Although the oracle collections reflect a discourse that existed prior to Esarhaddon’s decision to appoint Ashurbanipal as his successor to the throne, it remains doubtful whether, in the political monarchical structure of the Assyrian empire, one should envisage a scenario of public reading designed to persuade the elites to support the future crown prince. Esarhaddon’s report on his campaign in Šubria to eliminate rival claimants to the throne describes the monarch’s use of overt physical force in cases of non-compliance with his wishes. Furthermore, the institutional setting of the loyalty oath was designed to guarantee obedience to the crown. In the case of the oracle collections, therefore, the gods and future rulers appear to be a much likelier audience than any contemporaries, as only they are in a position to evaluate Esarhaddon’s conformity with tradition; the divine voice recorded in the oracles certainly intends to provide cogent evidence that Esarhaddon did conform to the cosmic plan. Esarhaddon’s oracle collections evoke Jorge Borges’ notion of the writing of the god as instantaneous absolute plenitude that leaves diachronic

360 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
writing behind in merging the past, present, and the future into the cosmic plan.170 The listing of prospective campaigns in Aššur’s oracles thus loses any historical value in its own right. Instead, these historical references serve the general purpose of expressing Aššur’s promise to defend the king against any enemy who might threaten Assyria in the future. The Aššur oracles, while employing the retrospective perspective, establish Esarhaddon’s individual fate as a historic model and thus turn his reign – itself based on irregular succession – into a synecdoche for Assyrian rulership per se that is in compliance with the divine design.
9.5 Ashurbanipal and the Omen Tradition
9.5.1 Ashurbanipal’s Personal Take on the Extispicy Omen Series iškar bārûti
The other instance of royal appropriation of an established scholarly text category, in this case the extispicy series iškar bārûti, dates to the reign of Ashurbanipal, who used this omen series to establish his own deeds as a paradigm within a symbolic system that was ultimately subject to divine authority.171 As indicated by a tablet from his library that lists only historical omens,172 Ashurbanipal was well informed about the existence of historical omens concerning the kings of Akkad and Ur III, and he revived the historical omen tradition in order to include himself among the ‘model kings.’
Excerpt Tablet:
1 If the gall-bladder completely surrounds the liver, it is the omen of Sargon who by this omen 2 marched on the land of Elam, defeated the Elamites, 3 imposed on them ... (and) cut off their food supplies? 4 If the gall-bladder completely surrounds the liver and [its? to]p? falls upon it; the gall bladder hangs down 5 It is the omen of Sargon, who marched on the land of Amurru, 6 defeated the land of Amurru, and conquered the entire world 7 If the right side of the liver is four times as thick as its left side?, and the caudate lobe lies on top of it, 8 it is the omen of Sargon who by this omen ... dominion over Babylon. 9 He removed soil from the ... gate and ... named it Babylon.

Ashurbanipal and the Omen Tradition 361
10 [In front of?] Akkad he built (another) city, and named it [Babylon]. 11 [...] he settled [therein?].173
Esarhaddon made use of prophecy to rewrite history in the collective oracle tablets; Ashurbanipal preferred to make use of the textual vehicle of scholarly extispicy, the omen series. The distinction between practice and textual production in the domains of prophecy and divination is crucial to my argument. In divination, individual omen reports reflect practice based on observation, but the omen compendia are purely textual scholastic products (which can include omina based on observation).174 The rulers of the ancient Near East made extensive use of divination for ad-hoc decision-making in daily affairs. By contrast, appropriation of the omen series as a system of thought that communicates the image of the model king and preserves the reign of individual kings as a historical paradigm is very rare in Mesopotamian history.175 It is this latter aspect that I investigate here in more depth.176
173 Starr 1986, 635. 174 This argument has long been made for the astrological omen compendia, see Rochberg 2004 and 2010; recently Richardson 2010 and Winitzer 2011 made the case for extispicy omen compendia. 175 Note that no omen reports or omen compendia survive in Sumerian or Akkadian language before the beginning of the second millennium BCE (Michalowski 2006 and Richardson 2010), and that the distribution of omen texts and the exclusively Akkadian technical terminology of the craft contrast with the elaborate passage from Šulgi’s Hymn B (ll. 131‒149) in which the king boasts of surpassing his diviners in the relevant knowledge. Not only does Šulgi claim to have excelled in decoding the signs written in the liver by listing a host of situations for which royal performance required the taking of oracles, he even claims authorship of lists of omens, thus throwing the significance of omen compendia into high relief. Šulgi B: 131‒149 “I am a ritually pure diviner, (máš-šu-gí-gíd dadag-ga-me-en) I am Nintu of the written lists of omens! (gìri-gen-na inim uzu-ga-ka dnin-tud-bi gá-me-en) For the proper performance of the lustrations of the office of the high priest, For singing the praises of the high priestess and (their) selection for (residence in) the gipar, For the choosing of the Lumah and Nindingir priests by pure extispicy For (decision to) attack the south or strike the north, For opening the storage of (battle) standards, For the washing of the lances in the “water of battle,” And for making wise decisions about rebel lands, The (ominous) words of the gods are most precious, indeed! After taking a propitious omen from a white lamb ‒ an ominous animal At the place of questioning water and flour are libated; I make ready the sheep with ritual words And my diviner watches in amazement like a barbarian.



362 The Individual Ruler as a Model for Kingship: Rethinking Ancient Historiography
In northern Mesopotamia, examination of the entrails of sacrificial animals for royal purposes dates back to the Early Dynastic period, as is revealed by profession lists. Royal inscriptions of king Ur-Nanshe of Lagash mention the use of extispicy, as indicated by the wording “to choose by means of extispicy”, Sumerian maš pà, for the installment of a certain official as spouse of the goddess Inanna.177 Another royal inscription by the same king contains an incantation to the reed for ritual purposes. In this incantation the god Enki pronounces a favorable verdict (éš.bar) to ensure its efficacy in a dedication ritual. This favorable divine verdict probably occurred on the basis of extispicy as well, as illuminated by later texts in which éš.bar equals Akkadian purussû “divine verdict” and is spoken generally by the sun god as decoded from the signs in the liver.178 Contemproary with the southern evidence, Pre-Sargonic adminis
The ready sheep is placed in my hand, and I never confuse a favorable sign with an unfavorable one. ...
In the inside of a single sheep I, the king, Can find the (divine) message for the whole universe.” In this text passage Šulgi addresses the two domains of divination from the outset: practice and scholarship. He first refers to himself as a ‘ritually pure diviner’, i.e. as somebody involved in the omen practice and then as Nintu, creating and compiling the omen compendia. Šulgi then outlines the contexts that require divination. Šulgi’s list of situations related to the performance of divination does not only reveal the king to be the primary agent of divination, but further demonstrates that he has fully understood the importance of conveying the notion that he acted in compliance with the cosmic order as designed by the gods. Šulgi’s insinuation that he had drawn up a systematic treatise of omens further demonstrates that he was aware of the model function of such omen compendia. By choosing a biological metaphor and comparing himself to the birth goddess Nintu in the process of composition, Šulgi does not emphasize his personal initiative but depicts royal action and performance as if they are inherent to the cosmic design. It is with Šulgi that we see for the first time the king usurping the weltanschauung originally advanced by the scholars. While the latter strove to position kingship within the larger cosmological framework, Šulgi, by appropriating the authorship of the omen compendia, steps outside of the system that inscribes royal performance in the authoritative past. Instead of fulfilling the role of the king who strives to match the ideal king and to meet the expectations linked with the office of kingship, Šulgi transforms himself into the epitome of the ideal king. Such royal appropriation of the entire system of thought was unprecedented and represents an interesting facet in the dynamics of royal-scholarly interaction, as it must eventually have been considered a threat to the status and role of the scholarly elites. 176 In contrast to Pongratz-Leisten 1999, which was more concerned with the operational side of decision-making on the one hand and with ideological self-representation in controlling this knowledge on the other; see also recently Radner 2011. 177 Frayne, Pre-Sargonic Period, RIME 1, Ur-Nanshe E1.9.1.17 iii 3‒6. 178 RIME 1, Ur-Nanshe E1.9.1.32 iii 1‒3.

trative documents from Ebla179 in Northern Syria listing numbers of sheep whose innards were used for the purpose of extispicy not only show that this method of divination was practiced on a large scale on behalf of the court, but also point to the king’s sponsorship and patronage of the craft.180 Certain year names from the Ur III and Old Babylonian period attest to the practice of choosing high officials and priests and priestesses by means of extispicy.181 The close relationship between the king and the diviners as royal advisors in cultic, political, diplomatic, and administrative affairs is illustrated by letters from the Old Babylonian period onward. This relationship is also apparent in the seals of the diviners, who position themselves in direct relation to the king, as illustrated by the seals of diviners to Šulgi,182 Daduša and Ibal-pi-El II of Ešnunna,183 and of Asqudum, the diviner to King Zimrilim of Mari: “Zimrilim, appointed by the god Dagan; Asqudum, the diviner.”184 The fact that Šulgi’s cupbearer and chief-steward calls himself ‘overseer of the extispicy priests’ (ugula maš-šu-gí-gíd-dè-ne)185 highlights the close connection between the court and a professional set of expert diviners. Several hundred years passed before the divinatory practice itself was transmitted in writing. In my view, the very emergence of textual production in the context of divination constitutes a conundrum for the modern scholar. By the early second millennium BCE three major divination genres emerged in quick succession. First, divinatory liver models from the so-called šakkanakku period appear in early second millennium BCE Mari; these models overlap partially with the end of the Ur III period and survived its collapse by several decades.186 The inscriptions on these liver models come in various formulations, suggesting that the diviners were still experimenting with the written framework for their technique. Three formulas occur: (a) ‘omen (amūt) + royal name,’ with the omen referring to the constellation of signs as depicted in the liver model; (b) ‘when (inūmi) + event’; and (c) ‘if (šumma) + event’. Over time, the second formula disappeared, the third became the standard form for recording omens, and the first remained in use for the historical omens inter

spersed in omen series.187 In formulas (a) and (b) the verbal tense is the preterite, while the present tense is reserved for formula (c). Two examples of historical omens may suffice by way of illustration:

The important feature of these liver models for the reader is that they presuppose a combination of image and text, i.e. the omen is represented by the physical form of the liver, which is different in all 32 liver models kept at the Louvre. The written text, by contrast, contains the apodosis. Regarding the use of different verbal tenses, namely preterite and present, it is intuitive to assume that texts using preterite verbal forms had a distinct purpose, which has generally been identified as didactic. Their function can, however, equally be read as paradigmatic, like that of the entries in the omen compendia. Support for this suggestion comes from Hazor, where several liver models have also been found.189 Liver model Hazor 17190 betrays some similarity to the omen collection of the bārûtu series. The editors of this liver model state:
What is striking about this model with its accompanying text is its similarity not only to the liver model tradition but, more importantly, to the Old Babylonian omen collections from Mesopotamia proper. This is made clear by a review of some of the points already discussed, including: 1) the standard interpretation of the double manzāzum/naplastum; 2) the explanation of the cleft as a forecast of rebellion on the basis of the set of associations KAK-shape/KAK-sign/kakku (weapon) à bartum (rebellion); 3) the relation of predic

tions of darkness/obscurity (eṭû ‘dark’) with the padānum; and 4) an example of the ‘temporal interpretive theme’. Moreover, in its wording and subject matter, the text follows standard conventions for the Mesopotamian divination tradition (bârûtu). Thus, Hazor 17 belongs to the mainstream of the extispicy divination tradition of Mesopotamia.191
The other two genres originated somewhat later in the Old Babylonian period, i.e. in the first half of the second millennium BCE. These genres are the omen reports containing either fortunate or unfortunate omens for a particular inquiry, and the omen compendia, most important of which is the extispicy series (iškar bārûti). Other series were added either during the Old Babylonian period or later, among them the astrological series Enūma Anu Enlil, the series Šumma izbu (concerned with malformed births),192 Šumma ālu (If a city (is set on high)),193 and the physiognomic series (Alamdimmû), to mention only the most prominent ones. In the first millennium BCE, Mesopotamian scholarship produced commentaries of all kinds, such as excerpt series, factual commentaries (mukallimtu), linguistic commentaries (ṣâtu), and explanatory series.194 Another extispicy series also emerged, known as the tamītu oracles and addressed to the sun god Šamaš and the weather god Adad. Although they deal primarily with the affairs of private persons, these tamītu oracles also include a number of historical omens referring to the Old Babylonian kings Hammurabi and Samsuditana; these omens have no practical setting and are like the omen series of a purely textual nature. They are attested only in copies from first millennium BCE Nimrud and Nineveh and have recently been edited by W. G. Lambert.195 As soon as divination was committed to writing, it formed a major part of scholarly libraries, royal libraries, and temple libraries. The divination tablets in Ashurbanipal’s library amount to more than a quarter of the surviving texts, bespeaking the importance of such divination texts in the ancient weltanschauung.196 Before discussing Ashurbanipal’s use of the historical omen tradition, I will comment on the historical omens and their intertextual relationship with other chronographic literature.

9.5.2 The Liver Models in the Broader Context of the Historical Omens
Historical omens alluding to historical persons are as old as the first recorded omen reports on liver models from Mari dating to the 19th century BCE.197 The value of such omens for historical reconstruction was intensely debated in Assyriological scholarship198 until Jerrold Cooper demonstrated their unsuitability as historical sources for reconstructing third millennium history in 1980.199 Liver models have been deemed of didactic purpose in the context of the professional training of the diviners. The fact that they include historical omens referring to the kings of Akkade and to the kings of the Ur III dynasty, to Gušur, first king of Kīš, and Kubaba, founder of the Third Dynasty of Kīš,200 as well as to the legendary kings Gilgameš and Etana, however, links them with the textual production of omen compendia rather than to that of omen reports and lends them a paradigmatic character. Rather than referring to actual historical events, they establish these kings and their deeds as models for kingship. The number of historical omens in the first millennium omen compendia is minimal when compared to the thousands of omens that are collected in the various omen series. Furthermore, until the first millennium historical omens are always interspersed among other apodoses and never form a coherent group of their own. The sparse evidence of the historical omens led Piotr Michalowski to consider them as “vignettes of the past”,” as “anecdotes lost in a vast ominous landscape.”201 He writes:
Of the thousands of such omens known to us today, slightly over 60 are “historical,” and these acquire a special status only when they are decontextualized and seriated into modern collections of historiographic data. Omens were an extremely important part of culture, but they were hardly privileged repositories of historical knowledge.202
Nonetheless Michalowski admits to the importance of Finkelstein’s essay in that
It was the first major attempt to analyze historiography “from the native point of view,” rather than as a reflex of modern intuitive concepts. Finkelstein was searching for a sense
197 Rutten 1936. 198 Finkelstein 1963, 463 and Grayson 1960 argue that these entries have historical value. Disagreement has been expressed by Güterbock 1934, 47 ff. and Reiner 1974. 199 Cooper 1980, 100. 200 Jean-Jacques Glassner discussed these omens in his paper “The Diviner as Historian” delivered at our workshop Ancient and Modern Perspectives on Historiography in the Ancient Near East, held at ISAW, April 12th, 2013. 201 Michalowski 1999, 76. 202 Ibid.



Ashurbanipal and the Omen Tradition 367
of the past; he was not interested in whether something actually happened, in the colloquial sense, but rather in the way in which earlier events, real or imaginary, were portrayed. In this way he almost succeeded in separating himself from earlier studies on history writing, which always seemed to return to the point of origin. Searching for the original kernel of truth that simply “must” lie hidden behind the textual distoritions of history.203
Although in the end Finkelstein was also searching for a genre that had a priviled connection with historical reality, his qualification of the omen texts ‒ and here we should include all the omens referring to royal action ‒ as lying at the root of Mesopotamian historiography has been so far unique and is invaluable for our modern understanding of how the ancients view their past. More than fifty percent of the omen entries, however, contain apodoses that are primarily concerned with political and military matters. These include the king’s involvement with court intrigues, treason, usurpation, border garrisons, the success of the army in the field, the loyalty of the people of the land, of officials, of vassal kings, and of members of the royal family.204 Omen entries referring to royal action constitute a rich repertoire of the possible constellations of power and interactions in which a king might find himself involved, and can therefore be read as paradigmatic for royal action.205 The paradigmatic function is further supported by the fact that among the historical omens there are several omens formulated in the past tense rather than the durative, which points to the future:
If there is a ‘well-being’ groove [on the sheep’s liver] that is like the squatting of a young bull, it is the omen of Gilgameš, who had no rival.
If the gall bladder is shaped like a lizard, it is the mark of Sargon.
If the heart is like a testicle, it is the omen of Rīmuš, whom his servants killed with their cylinder seals.
If the fetus is like a lion, it is an omen of Narām-Sîn, who subudued the world.
If the fetus is compact, it is an omen of Ibbi-Sîn: disaster.206
Numerous apodoses of this kind do not use third person verbal forms to refer to the king, but are expressed in the first or second person, thereby invoking the formulation of the omen reports and the notion of divinatory practice:

Even though these omen entries may have been copied from earlier oracle reports, references to kingship in the liver models and the omen compendia serve a purpose entirely different from that of observational practice, namely to inscribe royal performance in the “reciprocal relation that unites the cosmos, nature, and culture.”208 As Jean-Jacques Glassner states regarding the construction of the omen compendia, “the seer seeks more and more to define, by means of a meticulous description of occurrences, the modalities according to which are established the reciprocal relations that unite the two worlds of society and nature, longing for a plan in which the very subject matter of history is diluted.”209 The fact that the ancient scholars derived their material for historical apodoses not only from historical kings, but also from literary sources, such as the Gilgameš Epic or the Etana Myth, reiterates the paradigmatic nature of these historical omens, as the mythology revolving around these legendary kings provided the model for royal behavior.210 Such an understanding of the ancient sources is reinforced by the intertextual relationship between these omens and two chronicles. In the Chronicle of Early Kings, which covers kings from Sargon of Akkad (c. 2334‒2279 BCE) through to Agum III (c. 1450 BCE), the events recorded regarding the kings Sargon and Narām-Sîn of Akkad are the same as those recorded in the omen series.211 This is also true for the Weidner Chronicle, which starts with kings from the Early Dynastic period and continues through to the reign of Šulgi (2094‒2047 BCE), and which is primarily concerned with royal treatment of Marduk’s temple in Babylon and consequent divine reward and divine punishment.212 Both chronicles were composed during the first millennium BCE and both chronicles can be considered pseudo-chronicles, as they do not provide any valuable information regarding the history of events. In

Ashurbanipal and the Omen Tradition 369
stead, their concern lies with the heroic deeds of kings and with correct royal treatment of the cult; both chronicles occasionally record rather bizarre events, which is also true for various historical omens.213 The paradigmatic value of the early kings of Akkad in the omen compendia and the chronicles extends to the historical legends, and all three text categories coalesce around the paradigmatic royal figures who had constructed the ‘first empire’214 in history. An important point of difference, however, is that in the omen series Sargon and Narām-Sîn mostly appear as fortunate rulers, while legendary tradition divided between the two, turning Sargon into the paradigmatic fortunate ruler and using Narām-Sîn as both a positive and a negative model.215 Overall, intertextual links between omen compendia, pseudo-chronicles, and literature support the idea of an entirely text- rather than observationbased composition process for the omen compendia. This mingling of the legendary and historic past demonstrates that scholars were not concerned with the distinction between myth and history. Omen compendia – with their numerous references to anonymous kings and princes and the occasional historical omen – as well as pseudo-chronicles and historical legends amount to a corpus of culturally authoritative texts that anchor the royal office and royal action in the divinely ordained cosmic order, complemented by a critical voice regarding royal failures related to the cult. Given that the ancient weltanschauung was based on the reciprocal relationship between cosmos, nature, and culture and that liver models and omen compendia were paradigmatic in character, it is not surprising that under particular historical circumstances certain kings expressed an interest in appropriating the learned textual production of divination for their ideological selfrepresentation.
9.5.3 Military Victory and the Right to Kingship: The Liver Model of Daduša
Although Daduša was king of Ešnunna rather than of Assyria, Ešnunna is a key site in the development of the Tigridian cultural discourse of which Assyria was part. Accordingly, Daduša’s liver model is included in this discussion as a relevant example of how the royal use of certain scholarly text categories was intended to influence the reception of history and to secure the representation of a particular king. The purpose of King Daduša’s liver model – namely to

align the individual king’s reign with the overall cosmic schema – is similar to that of the prophecy for his predecessor on the throne of Ešnunna, Ibal-pi-El II. Nothing is known about Daduša before the interaction between Ešnunna and Šamšī-Adad I that is attested in the Mari letters,216 and the circumstances of his ascension to the throne remain obscure. Daduša’s liver model, however, reveals that his scholars were well versed in the divinatory tradition known from Mari and that they considered it an appropriate medium for the writing of history. Daduša’s liver model is comparable to the liver models from Mari in its combination of image, i.e. its representation of a particular formation of the liver, and text (fig. 55). While the image of the liver models from Mari appears to represent the protasis of the recorded omen, in Daduša’s liver model image and text are disconnected in that the first part of the text referring to observation does not actually describe the features represented in the clay model, but refers instead to a broader range of entrails including the belly, the heart, and the gut. Daduša’s liver model describes the king’s ascension to the throne in retrospect starting with a description of various pathological observations in the entrails. In contrast to the Mari liver models, however, no preterite verbal form is preserved in Daduša’s liver model, which uses the stative form instead. The stative verbal form was favored by scholars to describe “scientifically observed and recognized pieces of information, in the field of divination (we are mainly thinking of hepatoscopy and astrology) just as in that of medicine, astronomy,
216 Charpin and Ziegler 2003.



Ashurbanipal and the Omen Tradition 371
and mathematics.”217 As stated above, the “observed” features described in the text of Daduša’s liver model do not relate to the signs incised on the model itself but describe aspects of the belly, heart, and the gut, and ultimately quote an omen related to the soft part of the breastbone of the sheep (kaskasu). Observations relating to numerous parts of the body of a sacrificial animal are also known from the Old Babylonian period, linking the omen report recorded in Daduša’s liver model to these Old Babylonian omens.218 The apodosis of Daduša’s liver model omen implies the victory of the king, the particulars of which are then described and connected to the reading of omens on the occasion of Daduša’s accession to the throne. The pathological configurations drawn on Daduša’s liver model include features that are read at the beginning of an observation in the standard order of reading the liver. Among these features are the sign denoting the “presence” (manzāzu) or the “view” (naplastu),219 here represented doubled by the two parallel lines on the right side of the liver (= the lobus sinister in modern anatomical terms), followed by the “path” (padānu).220 The occurrence of a doubled manzāzu/naplastu is known from clay models and omen collections and generally implies a doubly positive sign indicating that “the gods are present and willing to communicate.”221 The crescent like marks known as the “horn” (qarnu) appear to provide information regarding the time of the king’s victory. In the following lines, the victory of Daduša is presented as having taken place either prior to his accession to the throne or during the first year of his reign. Daduša’s liver model thus introduces a literary prototype – namely the king’s accomplishment of a great victory in his first regnal year – that resurfaces many centuries later in the Middle Assyrian royal inscriptions of Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE), who uses this motif as a heroic-epic convention.222 Daduša’s liver model can thus be considered a literary creation derived from the practice of omen observation that identifies the very image of the liver with the “tablet of the gods” (ṭuppi ilāni), thereby advancing the notion that divine favor accompanies the king’s reign. Based on the above, it is possible to assume that scholars were able to produce texts related to but not reflective of observational practice by the reign
217 Glassner 2000, 207. 218 Nougayrol 1967. 219 During the Old Babylonian period manzāzu came to replace naplastu, see CAD N/1, 306, s.v. naplastu.

of Daduša in the eighteenth century BCE. This competence involved writing texts that transcended the simple image (protasis) and text (apodosis) relationship represented in the liver models from Mari. Despite the uniqueness of the Daduša liver model, the fact that the scribal communities of Mari and Ešnunna both made use of clay liver models establishes that they formed part of a common cultural horizon.

Daduša and Ibal-pi-El II are the only kings of Ešnunna who are known to have made use of the practice of extispicy or prophecy respectively in order to create new literary forms that anchor their reigns in the divinely ordained cosmic scheme. Both kings were the most powerful contemporaries of Šamšī-Adad I, and it was under their rule that Ešnunna’s expansion reached its greatest ex

tent; indeed, Šamšī-Adad I served as their vassal for some time.224 It might well be that the great power of these two kings of Ešnunna was accompanied by a heightened need for divine legitimization.
9.5.4 Ashurbanipal’s Appropriation of the Omen Compendia
This is also true – albeit on an altogether different scale – for the reigns of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal in the first millennium age of empires. Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal were both the beneficiaries of irregular succession to the throne, and they struggled with the expansion of their empire and the accompanying stress placed on the existing bureaucratic structure. Ever more frequent invocations of divine favor and sanction for their deeds – including fratricide for Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal and numerous executions of high officials for Esarhaddon – represents a hallmark of their commemorative inscriptions.225 In addition, Ashurbanipal, as noted throughout this book, was a passionate and major collector of cultural texts.226 He was well versed in the discipline of divination and communicated personally with his scholars regarding which series they were to collect for his libraries and which excerpts from particular series they were to copy; Ashurbanipal even wrote letters himself. Ashurbanipal’s erudition and his familiarity with scholarship and cultural discourse must have acquainted him with the historical omen tradition, as demonstrated by the excerpt tablet concerned with historical omens revolving around the kings Sargon and Narām-Sîn of Akkad, which in turn motivated him to establish himself as a paradigmatic king in ancient historiography. Ashurbanipal is famous for his self-presentation in colophons as an intellectual conversant in divination.227 In addition to the excerpt tablet with the historical omen collection quoted above,228 there is a letter that lists historical omens concerned with Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šum-ukīn (Rm 2, 455), which is discussed below, and another omen text (Rm 2, 134) written in Neo-Babyloni
224 Charpin and Ziegler 2003. 225 Pongratz-Leisten 1999. 226 Maurice Rheims’ characterization of the art collector applies to Ashurbanipal’s collection of divinatory, scientific, and literary texts to some degree: “l’objet d’art devient le symbole du gout, de l’intelligence, de la puissance sociale, de la richesse du collectionneur, et donne apparemment plus de prestige à ce dernier qu’au créateur” (Rheims 2002, 51). 227 BAK 100 and 101. 228 Chapter 9.5.1.

an script that refers to the kings Ashurbanipal, Hammurabi, and Itti-Mardukbalāṭu, and also dates to the reign of Ashurbanipal.229 The letter testifies to Ashurbanipal’s personal endeavor to be included in historical omens. It was written to him in the aftermath of his war against Tammarītu II of Elam by a diviner who asks the king in which form he should enter the apodosis referring to Ashurbanipal’s victory over the Elamite king. It represents a unique testimony to the king’s aspiration of not only being accepted in the ranks of scholarship but to obtain his place as paradigmatic king in ancient historiography as well. Unfortunately, the obverse is very badly preserved, and so my rendering is confined to the preserved section on the reverse:

With the demand to be entered in the omen series, Ashurbanipal revived the tradition of historical omens, which is last known to have been applied to King Nebuchadnezzar I (1125‒1104)231 and King Itti-Marduk-balāṭu (1139‒1132 BCE) of the Second Dynasty of Isin in a text that likewise dates to Ashurbanipal’s reign. This text is the omen text Rm 2, 134, written in Neo-Babylonian script and dating to Ashurbanipal’s reign,232 which also refers to Hammurabi and Ashurbanipal. The key revelation of Ashurbanipal’s demand as reflected in the letter of the diviner is that he knew about the tradition of historical omens, i.e. entering the names of individual kings into the apodoses of omens and that he deemed it important to be included among the paradigmatic kings in the omen compendia, which encompassed historical and legendary kings alike. Both myth, as represented in the figures of Gilgameš and Etana, and the distant past, as represented by the kings of Akkad and Ur III in the omen tradition, enjoyed the cultural status of sacred truth in ancient Mesopotamian societies. By aligning himself with these figures, Ashurbanipal clearly compares the historical significance of his destruction of Elam with the military achievements of the kings of Akkad, who established the world’s “first empire”. His victory over Tammarītu II did not just represent an ordinary military campaign, but entailed the obliteration of the state of Elam and the complete destruction of Susa, its political center.233 For a brief moment in history, Assyrian power appeared to align with the cosmic dimensions perceived by contemporary culture, and Ash

urbanipal’s entry in the omen series is a direct reflection of such ideological thinking. By inscribing himself into the authoritative and paradigmatic corpus of the omen compendia, Ashurbanipal had stepped outside the system of communication with the gods as controlled by the diviners and turned himself into the epitome of the ideal king in compliance with the cosmic order (kittu). This moment of universal control was fleeting, however, and the repercussions of the vacuum left behind by Ashurbanipal’s destruction of Elam were manifest in the rise of new political forces like the Medes and the Persians. The letter of the diviner is unique in several respects, not least on account of its being the latest example of an historical omen intended for inclusion in the omen series relating to extispicy (iškar bārûti). The letter confirms that although the notion of a standardized corpus of extispicy series (iškar bārûti) and accompanying commentaries was already well established,234 the compilation process retained its dynamism and remained subject to change. It also attests to the significance of these omen series to Ashurbanipal. As discussed above, the omen compendia differed fundamentally in their function from the practice of taking omens, as omen compendia did not serve the immediate goal of promulgating the message that the individual king’s reign had found divine approval and that the king, consequently, had conformed to the expectations of kingship. This purpose can still be ascribed to the earlier kings Daduša and Ibal-pi-El II, because these monarchs recreated a literary text category to convey the view that their ascent to the throne was divinely sanctioned. In the late Sargonid period, however, the rewriting of history through the divine voice reached another level altogether. In his oracle collections, Esarhaddon fashioned a narrative regarding his ascent to the throne that was mediated through the divine voice and constituted a model for irregular succession. Similarly, Ashurbanipal’s inclusion of his victory over Elam in the authoritative and paradigmatic corpus of the omen compendia served to convey the cosmic dimensions of his dominion. Through their appropriation of the text categories of oracle collections and omen compendia, Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal turned themselves into paradigmatic model kings. This development was fostered by the scholars of Nineveh, who subjected the bārûtu series to editing by “creating pairs of omens so that ‘right’/‘left’ in the protases corresponded to ‘the king’/‘the enemy’ in the apodoses.”235 In this way, scholars combined their competence in copying omens from their Babylonian predecessors with their creative abilities to ensure the king’s centrality in the omen series. Moreover, the version of the bārûtu series that dates to the

Ashurbanipal and the Omen Tradition 377
reign of Ashurbanipal includes two omens “which state that 1) Sargon defeated Elam and 2) Sargon enlarged his palace.”236 These entries do not reflect the deeds of Sargon II, but are to be associated with Ashurbanipal, who uses the name of Sargon of Akkad as a foil in order to associate himself with the heroic past. Additionally, these entries betray commonalities with tablets 14‒16 of the series ‘interpretation’ (Multābiltu), which also contains omens referring to Ashurbanipal.237 Further evidence of Ashurbanipal’s involvement in the textualization process of the omen compendia is provided by the hitherto unattested ‘orientation tablet’, which assigns the designation ‘right’ and ‘left’ to each subsection of the liver and the lung. This tablet bears Ashurbanipal’s colophon, which claims that he wrote the tablet in the assembly of the scholars.238 Another indication of Ashurbanipal’s personal involvement is the fact that commentaries and excerpts from commentaries sometimes contain illustrations of the kakku and padānu features of the liver or of parts of the lung – these aids are obviously meant to facilitate the king’s reading and comprehension of these texts.239 Evidence of this kind points not only to Ashurbanipal’s familiarity with tradition, but also to his ability to participate actively in the recreation of scholarly divinatory texts and in the reshaping of the stream of tradition. Two points are critical to a correct understanding of the royal appropriation of divination. First, the intricate relationship between divination and law fostered a weltanschauung in which the divine world, nature, and human agency were all subject to the notion of cosmic stability, order, and regularity (kittu). This system of thought was challenged during the first millennium BCE, when Esarhaddon usurped the prophetic voice of Ištar to write an account of his ascension to the throne that purported to be oracular. Second, the intertextual relationship between omen compendia, chronicles, and historical legends as well as astrological omens and literary prophecies reflects a notion of historiography that is paradigmatic in nature and unconcerned with the reconstruction of event history. The king’s appropriation of omen practice and of the textual stream of tradition represented in the omen compendia thus stands out as a

key cultural strategy that reflects a notion of cosmic order in which divine intentionality and royal agency were inextricably intertwined: appropriating omen practice serves to proclaim the success of the king’s reign, while appropriating the omen series as part of the stream of tradition serves to portray the king as a paradigmatic model.

State Rituals
10.1 Cultic and Ritual Contributions to Assyrian Ideological Discourse
When Assyria developed into a territorial state during the Middle Assyrian period and then a large-scale empire during the Neo-Assyrian period, it faced the problem of integrating local communities and their activities into a more complex centralized organizational system. In order to control conquered regions, Assyria relied not only on its superiority in technological warfare, but also on various economic, ideological, and political strategies.1 Throughout Mesopotamian history, rulers made use of similar strategies to maintain their authority, favoring one or the other; in Assyria, these strategies were formed into a coherent system and perfected. During the Middle Assyrian period, Assyrian expansion toward the Hābūr and beyond2 prompted the implementation of economic measures that strengthened Aššur’s position as the imperial center. A twotiered system served to bind the provinces to the administrative and cultic center of Aššur, namely the payment of regular taxes to the palace and the monthly delivery of gināʾu offerings to the Aššur temple. Information regarding the gināʾu offering comes from tablets found in ten clay pots at the southwest side of the large forecourt of the Aššur temple of the Middle Assyrian period, rebuilt under Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE). Nearly all of these tablets concern the administration of the gināʾu offerings in the Aššur temple.3 Among these texts are tabular lists that supply data in condensed form regarding the total amount of the four different kinds of gināʾu offerings from the provinces of the Assyrian empire that were delivered to Aššur in one year, including cereals, honey, sesame, and fruit. There was a great deal of variation in the quantity and nature of deliveries from the various provinces from year to year, but the average annual total received by the Aššur temple is estimated to be approximately “1000 homer (c. 100 m3) cereals, 10 homer (c. 1 m3) honey, 100 homer (c. 10 m3) sesame and 50 homer (c. 5 m3) fruit.”4 These deliveries were managed by the supervisor of the gināʾu offerings

(šā muhhi gināʾe). Three such supervisors are known by name from the period between Tukultī-Ninurta I (1233‒1197 BCE) and Aššur-dan I (1169‒1134),5 though during the reign of Tiglath-pileser I (1114‒1076 BCE) a comparable office – perhaps the same office with a different designation – was held by a person named Ezbu-lēšer, who bore the title rab gināʾe. Although most of the tabular lists of gināʾu offerings can be dated to Tiglath-Pileser I, eponyms in some of the texts indicate that the archive begins toward the end of Tukultī-Ninurta I’s reign;6 as such, the archive documents a practice stretching over more than a hundred years. The tabular lists are five column-tablets of horizontal format, of which four columns list quantities of cereals, honey, sesame, and fruit, while the fifth column lists provinces. These tablets give a sense of the territory that was actually under the control of the Assyrian king,7 and it is interesting to note that the deliveries are designated by the term maddattu, “tribute” that was supplied by provincial governors.8 In other words, only the provinces of the land of Aššur (māt Aššur) were obliged to send these regular deliveries – not the vassal kingdoms. Twenty-five tabular lists have been identified thus far.9 The headings or subscripts of these lists refer either to ‘received regular offerings’ (gināʾu mahru)10 or ‘missing regular offerings’ (gināʾu muṭṭāʾu).11 Some lists bear the subscript “later/final? cleared list of the eponym PN” (ṭuppu urkītu za(k)kūtu ša līme PN).12 The list of provinces obliged to send regular deliveries to the Aššur temple was probably established under Ninurta-apil-ekur (1181‒1169 BCE), though the practice essentially dates back to the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I.13 The gināʾu offerings supplied by the provinces represent only very basic provisions for the Aššur temple, and their purpose appears to have been primarily symbolic. From a financial perspective, the support provided by the gināʾu offerings was not of great consequence and could have been provided by the lands of the temple itself. These offerings thus served to express the

binding together of the imperial center and the imperial periphery,14 a relationship reinforced by the performance of the tākultu-ritual, as is discussed below. A modified system of regular offerings appears to have operated during the Neo-Assyrian period, as is demonstrated by a decree of Adad-nīrārī III (810783 BCE) concerning regular offerings for the Aššur temple,15 sealed with the seal of Aššur and Ninurta. In this instance, however, only a few towns – all located in the province of Arbela – had the obligation to supply offerings. This document contains the interesting regulation decreeing that towns, fields, houses, orchards, and people are not to be given to any other governor, only to the one responsible for the Aššur temple. Several letters from the Neo-Assyrian period sent to the king by temple officials report failure to deliver offerings to the Aššur temple and other temples and ask the king what action should be taken.16 In the following case, the complaint concerns the failure to deliver livestock:
1 [To the king], my lord: [your servant, D]adî. [Good health t]o the king, my lord. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord. 5 Two oxen and 20 sheep, offerings of the king’s heart (to be provided) by the city of Diquqina, have not been delivered. The king, my lord, should inquire about them. Three rams are for the temple of Dag[an, x] are for the town of [... for the me]al of [...]. It has now been [x] years that they have not been delivering. They have ceased. The king, my lord [should ...] his soldiers. r.2 The priest of Aššur consumes [(...)] 20 sheep from the [offerin]gs of Šebat (XI). Last year I wrote to the king, my lord, about it. The king, my lord, wrote back, saying: “Assign (them) to the storehouse for pickled meat.” I assigned (them). Now the temple scribe is saying to me: “Give them to the harem governess of the Inner City.” Now then, I have written to the king, my lord. What is it [that] the [ki]ng, my lord, commands?17
In addition to the administrative and economic strategies for integrating various communities into a coherent imperial system described above, there was also an ideological dimension. It is breathtaking to observe how from the reign of Šamšī-Adad I (1808‒1776 BCE) onward, Assyrian and Babylonian scholars creatively engaged with cultural models extant in the Hurrian and Babylonian tradition and interweaved mythology and ritual performance in order to anchor the image of Assyrian kingship in the contemporary Weltanschauung.

382 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
10.2 Three Middle Assyrian Rituals Originating in a Changing Political Matrix
A brief discussion of the meager evidence of ritual texts from the Middle Assyrian period serves as a useful starting point for discussing the Neo-Assyrian state rituals as they provide a glimpse of the intercultural dynamics at the moment of major Assyrian expansion towards the west and the south. These Middle Assyrian ritual texts include a ritual for the god Adad, a ritual for Marduk, which will not be included in Simo Parpola’s forthcoming edition of the Assyrian Rituals, and a ritual for a mouth-tongue object (ka-eme). All three texts are poorly understood, and I by no means claim to be able to add substantially to their understanding. These texts do, however, offer an insight into the elaborate treatment of ritual performance by scholars already in the Middle Assyrian period, who concerned themselves with various minutiae of ritual performance and with the integration of various cultic locations in ritual performance. I will quote the texts in full in the hope of instigating further discussion of them in the future. The ritual for Adad, KAR 154, was first edited by Brigitte Menzel. It begins with offerings in the bīt šalīme, which was probably located within the Adad temple, and then describes a procession of the god from his temple to the gate of the storehouse (bīt abusāte) of Ninurta,18 located in the Aššur temple, probably near to the entrance area. The procession involves the Aššur Gate located to the west, somewhere between the mušlālu and the Aššur temple,19 the Samuh Gate (location unknown), the bīt hamri, and the Quay Gate (location unknown, but probably in the western part of the northern Quay wall20), and then returns to the Adad Temple. The procession thus links the entire northern part of the citadel in the city of Aššur topographically. The main participants in the ritual are the qadištu-women, who repeatedly perform inhu-songs for the god at various locations included in the procession, and the šangû of Adad who performs purifications. Ritual prescriptions focus on the movement between the sites at which the cultic performance is carried out by the qadištuwomen and the šangû. The jewelry of the qadištu-women is referred to explicitly, and this jewelry is removed upon their return. The text concludes with an exact listing of the distribution of meat, which is shared by the gods and the ritual participants. The divine recipients include Adad, Šala, Taramua, Kubu,
18 Note that this location is not mentioned among the parts dedicated to Ninurta in the Götteradressbuch and may therefore have disappeared by the Neo-Assyrian period. 19 Unger 1932, 177; Pongratz-Leisten 1994, 26 f.; George 1988, 32. 20 Schwemer 2001, 248.

and Anu, while the alahinnu-official – a high status member of the administrative personnel of the temple responsible for the inspection of the garments, the jewelry, and probably the treasury of the gods – is included among the human recipients alongside the qadištu women and the šangû.21 The Aššur temple was apparently provided for first, but the relevant part of the text is only fragmentarily preserved. The king is conspicuously absent from the ritual.

The central features of this Middle Assyrian ritual are familiar from elsewhere in the Syrian and Northern Mesopotamian region, particularly the association of qadištu-women with the god Adad, known from Kiš and Sippar, and with the goddess Annunītu, the warrior aspect of Ištar, known from Mari.22 The qadištuwomen are women of special status who could own property, nurse the children of other people, and act as midwives, with which they are associated in the Babylonian Flood Story Atrahasīs. This is interesting insofar as in the NeoAssyrian period Ištar assumes the role of midwife for the king, while already in the Early Dynastic period the nu-gig/qadištu is a central figure in the cult of Inanna, who herself adopts the epithet nu-gig.23 Further, according to the catalogue of songs KAR 158, the inhu-songs – here performed by the qadištuwomen for Adad – are supposed to be addressed to Ištar. In a Neo-Assyrian ritual referred to by Joan Westenholz, the qadištu-woman uses salt to undo a lightheartedly sworn oath.24 It should be noted in this regard that in the Middle Assyrian royal inscriptions Adad and Ištar appear together in curse formulas, as they do for the first time in the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend. Although the goddess Ištar does not appear in KAR 154, the cultic actions performed for Adad only make sense through his association with her. Consequently, even though the various constituents of this ritual are not always explicit, it nevertheless reflects the cultural context of Middle Assyrian Aššur. The other Middle Assyrian ritual worth mentioning is VAT 16435, originally published by F. Köcher under the title Ein mittelassyrisches Ritualfragment zum

Neujahrsfest. Unfortunately, the excavation number is lost, making it impossible to know whether the text is from Aššur or Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta. On paleographical grounds Köcher dated the text between 1200 and 1000, i.e. after the conquest of Babylon by Tukultī-Ninurta I. The language is Middle Assyrian and the choice of the ritual language, i.e. the use of the D stem and Š stem to describe the movement of the deity,25 also points to Assyrian authorship of the text, as in Babylonia the G stem is used in such contexts instead. Furthermore, it is only Marduk who takes a seat on the Dais of Destinies (parak šimāte), a practice reminiscent of the much later performance of the new year festival in Sargonid times, where this act is performed by Aššur alone in contrast to Babylonian custom. Köcher suggests an Assyrian setting for the performance of the ritual; this is, however, unlikely, given that there was no Dais of Destinies in Aššur at this time, at least according to Sennacherib, who built an entire annex to the Aššur temple in order to install this particular cultic feature.26 Apart from the fact that there is no archaeological evidence for an architectural structure predating Sennacherib’s festival house and that there is also no evidence in later texts that the procession made its way to the festival house on boats, it is hard to imagine that at any time in Assyrian history any divinity could rival Aššur to such a degree in the official cult of the city. My suggestion, therefore, has been to understand this ritual text as a prescription intended to help the Assyrian king to correctly perform the ritual in Babylon – not necessarily during the time of Tukultī-Ninurta, who had abducted the statue of Marduk, but under the reign of a later king, perhaps Tiglath-Pileser I.

The third Middle Assyrian ritual worth mentioning is the text KAR 139, which has prompted much speculation regarding the possible existence in Assyria of a mystery cult linked to the goddess Ištar, a view advanced in particular by A. Leo Oppenheim, Simo Parpola, Joan Westenholz, and Eckart Frahm.27 KAR 139 was first edited by Erich Ebeling28 and discussed by A. Leo Oppenheim,29 and has since been edited anew by Brigitte Menzel.30 Oppenheim argues that Ištar assumes two different roles in this ritual, “first as a center of a secret cult association, and second, as a mediatrix, an intercessor with the gods on behalf of the suffering men who turn to her sacred symbol, called Mouth-and-Tongue, in order to reach out effectively toward the distant gods.”31 A similar view is adopted by Simo Parpola, who also places KAR 139 in the context of a mystery cult. As I have argued in an earlier article,32 applying the notion of the Greek mystery cult to Assyrian religion is problematic because we do not know of any Assyrian ritual that describes an initiation similar to that of the Greek mystery cults, incorporating the ritual sequence of purification (kάθαρσισ), initiation in the form of instruction (λόγος), and vision (τελετή).33 Attestations of visions, auditions, and ecstasy – which are described in the context of prophecy, especially in the Mari letters – do not amount to a mystery cult linked to Ištar. Further, Oppenheim’s suggestion that piriltu/pirištu should be connected

with a “body of rules imparted in some way exclusively to a particular group of worshippers of a deity”34 and that these rules refer to moral and behavioral obligations seems far-fetched in the context of Assyrian and even broader ancient Near Eastern religion, as religious knowledge primarily served to enable correct communication with the gods. As I have argued, moreover, exclusivity of knowledge was practiced in scholarly circles; this is conveyed in the Enmeduranki Legend, in which the king represents himself as the hinge between the scholars and diviners, transferring divine knowledge to select members of the ancient Babylonian cult centers. Given the explicitness with which texts comment on the relationship between the king and Inanna/Ištar throughout Mesopotamian history, one would expect similar evidence for the members of the mystery cult. Such evidence is, however, lacking: “contrary to the mysteries in which knowledge benefits the individual for his or her personal transformation, in Sumerian and Assyrian-Babylonian ideology knowledge is given to the king to benefit the society and the cosmos as a whole ... If the king refers to this knowledge, he always refers to pragmatic knowledge enabling him to carry out his role as leader. From the perspective of Ashurbanipal’s self-praise, which focuses on his training in scribal, cultic, military, and hunting skills, this knowledge may be defined as education rather than initiation. Finally, ancient Near Eastern culture exhibits no sign of controlling religious behavior or defining boundaries of the accepted religion as do the later mystery religions.”35 The ritual described in KAR 139 takes place in the bīt ēqi in Kār-TukultīNinurta. It is not yet known whether the bīt ēqi was associated with the temple of Ištar, comparable to cultic practice in the city of Aššur. A ritual involving the ēqu as an object is only attested in the series Iqqur īpuš, in which the king places it in front of Adad.36 The ēqu ritual appears to have originated in the Hurrian milieu, as it is only attested in Nuzi, Middle Assyrian, Neo-Assyrian, and Standard Babylonian, and is geographically confined to the Upper Mesopotamian-Hurrian regions.37 Daniel Schwemer observes that Hurrian egi “spring, innermost part” plays a role in the cult of Ištar-Šauška.38 This is interesting insofar as the Götteradressbuch lists a dgašan ēqi among the gods of the Ištar temple at Nineveh.39 The ritual participants in KAR 139 are the šangû, the

owner of the sacrifice, and a ritual object called “Mouth-Tongue” (ka-eme). Such tongue objects are known primarily from eliminatory rites in the Hittite cult in which they serve to materialize curses and maledictions spoken against the royal couple and, once materialized, are ritually discarded. There are, however, also tongue-objects made of silver or gold which represent benedictions.40 Volkert Haas has already observed that the latter function must have applied to the Mouth-Tongue object used in KAR 139.41 Here it assumes a mediating function on behalf of the owner of the sacrifice before the goddess Ištar. Such beneficial function of this object is also attested in šuilla-prayers from Aššur addressed to Nusku and Ea.42 It further occurs in the legends of Kassite seals, which led Wiebke Meinhold to identify this object with the rhombusshaped symbol in the iconography of Kassite seals and various Neo-Assyrian seals.43 In its ritual function the Mouth-Tongue object is also attested among the minor deities receiving offerings in the Coronation Ritual44 and in the NeoAssyrian tākultu-ritual.45 Both texts belong to the official royal cult. Oppenheim notes that the šangû does not participate in the ritual actively but speaks in the name of Ištar after the owner of the sacrificial lamb has performed his ritual actions. This seems to be a very important detail because it recalls the context of prophecy in which the prophets convey the oracle of Ištar: “the possibility of a link to prophecy is corroborated by the fact that the text not only mentions the secrets of Ištar, pirišti Ištar, but also the abat Ištar, ‘the word of Ištar,’ a technical term used later in the Sargonid period to denote the oracles of Ištar.”46 In my former treatment of the text I conceded that, if this text is supposed to revolve around the figure of the king, one should expect that the cultic participant is addressed as “king” (šarru). I still regard it as plausible that the ritual represents a mandatory preparatory step to be performed by the crown prince before becoming king and going through the Coronation Ritual, especially as the Mouth-Tongue object figures among the recipients of offerings in the latter ritual. The other possible scenario would be that this ritual represents a ceremony incumbent upon prophets before they assumed their position in the temple, in order to guarantee that the content of the oracles delivered

While at the moment it is difficult to pinpoint the exact contribution of these Middle Assyrian rituals to Assyrian royal discourse, they all reveal in one way or another Assyrian interaction with either Syro-Anatolian or Babylonian cultures and thus directly reflect Assyrian expansion during the second half of the second millennium BCE. They also provide excellent testimony to the fact that political expansion and control over foreign territory went hand in hand

with the appropriation or adaptation of cultural practice that was deemed beneficial for the institution of kingship.
10.3 The Assyrian State Rituals of the Sargonid Period
10.3.1 Introduction
The Assyrian state rituals of the Sargonid period are a powerful mechanism for publicizing the body politic of the king in his cosmic function. The corpus of rituals discussed below demonstrate the effective adaptation by Assyrian scholars of Sumero-Babylonian and Hurrian myth and ritual practice in order to generate an Assyrian ideological program centered on the figure of the king as the human agent of the supreme god Aššur. Reading the rituals as a group rather than individually enables us to appreciate the “syntax” of Assyrian ritual, built on a number of constituents that continuously reiterate the king’s primary task of securing the cosmic order; this demonstrates that Assyrian state rituals from the Middle Assyrian period onward were developed by informed scholars for an educated audience that was able to identify the plentiful and sophisticated allusions to mythology that were integrated in ritual performance. Ceremonial public performance of rituals figures as one of the central devices used to manifest divine support for the king’s authority. The efficacy of the Neo-Assyrian ritual performances pertaining to the Šabatu-Addaru-Nisannu cycle in particular can only be understood when they are approached in conjunction with the cultic commentaries published by Alasdair Livingstone48 and the extant corpus of ancient Near Eastern mythology centered on the divine figure of the warrior god. Although cultic commentaries have for a long time been perceived as an esoteric genre somewhat disconnected from the rest of cultural production, the corpus of cultic commentaries works to illuminate the meaning of Assyrian rituals and at the very least sheds light on how ritual performances were understood in certain scholarly circles in the late Neo-Assyrian period.49 To the uninformed reader, prescriptions for ritual performance can appear to be little more than instructions for the preparation of sumptuous offerings and the movement of ritual participants between various localities. Cultic commentaries, however, explain how rituals reiterate a sequence of action that com

bines hunting, warfare, cosmic battle, and the renewal of the king’s status as ruler of the universe in a continuum of confrontation with the forces of chaos, which are defeated and brought under Assyrian control. Unlike Greek drama, this reenactment of the cosmic battle does not operate in a linear narrative. Instead, ritual prescriptive texts, ritual reports, and commentary literature choose key moments of action, along with objects, songs, and words that reference these moments, and use these to evoke two elements of the common cultural memory, namely 1) the well-known battle narrative revolving around the warrior god Ninurta, and 2) theogony referencing the notion of regicide. The ideological implications of these Neo-Assyrian state rituals reflect the ancient world’s perspective on kingship, in which the king’s function as guarantor of civic and cosmic order is central. It is this royal obligation that explains the pervasiveness of combat myths and their ritual reenactment in royal contexts. Myth and ritual serve as explanatory patterns for the developing ideological framework, which not only asserts a utopian vision of the king mastering any potential disruptive forces but also conveys a notion of cohesion and consent among all the peoples of the empire. Myth and ritual were a key part of cultural discourse and were as important as pragmatic action in the consolidation and stabilization of Assyrian power and control, both in the imperial heartland and in the provinces. Myth and ritual were powerful means for visualizing and negotiating the asymmetrical power relationships represented by the monarchical system, and, as is apparent in the correspondence between the king and his scholars, they were carefully orchestrated to reinforce the king’s historical and cosmic role. A family of exorcists located in Aššur, known primarily through the figure of its chief Kiṣir-Aššur (the author of several state rituals) and his apprentices, was responsible for organizing the cult of the Aššur temple, i.e. the state cult, in the Sargonid period.50 Throughout Assyrian history, even when it was not the political capital, the city of Aššur retained its status as a cultural and religious center of primary importance and as a center for the creation, elaboration, and performance of state rituals, as well as serving as the burial place of Assyrian kings. As is discussed below, the purpose of Assyrian state rituals transcends the legitimization of the status quo and the enhancement of royal authority. Although these rituals embody certain views of how the world and society are constructed,51 they also respond to specific historical situations and are therefore capable of transforming and reinventing tradition.52 This applies

to the Assyrian versions of the akītu-festival and the tākultu-ritual in particular, as they developed in Assyria during the late Sargonid period. In Assyria, these state rituals demanded not only the physical presence of the king, as they did in Babylonia, but also the king’s active participation in his role as chief šangû of the god Aššur. Assyrian state rituals demonstrate the capacity of Assyrian scholarly experts to evoke the spatial dimensions of the empire and to implement a sacred topography that includes even the most distant regions of the territory controlled by the king. In the composite and varied nature of Assyrian state rituals these sites constitute a mental topography of the empire that merges with elements of mythology, ancestor worship, and theological visions of divinity. Taken as a whole, these various strands ultimately delineate the Assyrian concept of divine and human rulership, performed in tandem by the god Aššur and the human king.
10.3.2 The Tākultu-ritual
10.3.2.1 Envisioning a Unified Territory: The Development of the Tākultu-Ritual
The tākultu-ritual is the earliest attested of the major state rituals and is known from the Old Babylonian period.53 In Babylonia, Sum. gišbun/Akk. tākultu appears simply to have implied a festive meal or banquet (< akālu, “to eat”), as is described in Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave when Lugalbanda prepares a meal for the gods in gratitude for his recovery.54 The adoption of this festival in northern Mesopotamian tradition, by contrast, adds a strong spatial component that binds the periphery to the center. The Sargonid variants of the tākultu-ritual text invoke all the gods of Aššur, the Assyrian heartland, and incorporated provinces, and offer sacrifices to them in order to elicit their blessings for the city of Aššur, Assyria, and the Assyrian king. Because of these spatial implications, tākultu differs from Sum. bur/Akk. naptanu, which is also translated as “meal” or “ceremonial banquet” in the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.55 A protocol (SAA 20 no. 33) and numerous accounts listing the kinds of food that are to be distributed to the numerous officials and courtiers of the royal court (SAA 7 nos. 148‒157) suggest that the tākultu-ritual has a different pur

pose.56 The tākultu-ritual should also be distinguished from the qerītu, likewise a banquet festival, but one dedicated to only one deity and that could serve as a synonym for the akītu-festival of the god Aššur, among others.57 The tākultu-ritual is attested in the period of Šamšī-Adad I (1808‒1776 BCE) on a vase inscription dedicated to the god Dagan. While Šamšī-Adad I’s inscription is fragmentary, it seems that the festival was already part of the cult of the city of Aššur at this point. Furthermore, it was considered so important that the king deemed it worthy of mention in a dedication to another deity:

The tākultu-ritual is attested again in inscriptions from the Middle Assyrian period onward, beginning with the inscriptions of Adad-nīrārī I (1295‒1264 BCE), that is, with the first major westward expansions following the end of Mitannian overlordship. Potsherds recovered from the Aššur temple point to the ritual’s performance:

(Property) of the temple of the god Aššur. Adad-nīrārī, king of Assyria, made (it) at his third (var. fourth) tākultu.
Similar vessel inscriptions from the reign of Adad-nīrārī I’s son and successor Shalmaneser I (1263‒1234 BCE) were buried under the floor of the Aššur temple.60 As meager as the evidence is, it seems that Šamšī-Adad I’s vision of territorial dominion over Upper Mesopotamia and the subsequent expansionist ambitions of the Middle Assyrian kings from Adad-nīrārī I (1295‒1264 BCE) onward correspond with a deliberate attempt to foster territorial control also by ritual means. The tākultu-ritual is a major component of this cultural strategy and originates in a time when Aššur retained its role as Assyria’s political center. No written evidence survives from the many centuries that follow. It is therefore difficult to ascertain whether the tākultu-ritual was practiced continuously in the Assyrian cult throughout the Neo-Assyrian period. Only in the Sargonid period – and particularly during the reigns of Sennacherib (704‒681 BCE) and his successors, when Assyria reached its maximum territorial extent – do written sources again attest to the celebration of the tākultu festival (SAA 20 nos. 38‒47).61 Although the term tākultu is not explicitly mentioned in text SAA 20 no. 37, this text, written by Ashurbanipal’s (668‒631/27? BCE) chief exorcist Kiṣir-Aššur, is likely to be an abbreviated version of the ritual. Several other texts survive from the reigns of Ashurbanipal62 and Aššur-eṭelilāni (627‒625? BCE),63 stemming from Nineveh,64 Aššur,65 and Sultantepe.66 The festival, consequently, must have been celebrated on several occasions during the reign of a single king or, if celebrated solely at his coronation, may have been celebrated in numerous cities simultaneously or have warranted study in multiple places. In the copy of the tākultu festival performed for Sennacherib (SAA 20 no. 38), the ritual begins with an invocation of the gods of the Aššur temple and continues with the gods of other major temples in Aššur before proceeding to invoke the gods of Nineveh. Subsequently, the text returns to the gods of

several temples in Libbi-āli/Aššur before embracing a wider geographical scope by invoking the gods of the eastern Tigridian region, Esagila and Babylon, and Der. The end of the ritual closes the geographical circle by returning to Aššur, invoking the names of the Divine Judges in the Aššur temple, and finally proceeding to Nineveh, invoking the gods of the political capital and the king’s political residence. This first large section listing the divinities that are to be invoked by the king or the priest is sporadically interspersed with brief requests for blessings and with ritual prescriptions. Below follow some examples:
iv 5′‒16′ [... may hea]ven and earth, the manifest [gods], all the [gods] who dwell in sanctuaries accept [wit]h you, may they listen [with] you! [Bles]s the city of Aššur, [bles]s the land of Aššur, [bless] Sennacherib, our [lord]!
and

Prayers in the ritual beseech blessings for the king:
rev. ii 1′‒6′ Give Sennacherib, our lord, [lo]ng [days, everlasti]ng y[ears], a strong weapon, a long [re]ign, and supremacy [ov]er kings! [He w]o [gave] these to his gods – [give him lo]ng , wide [....].
Sennacherib’s tākultu text ends with a section (rev. V 5 ff.) that is separated from the previous part by a double ruling. It differs entirely from the preceding lists in that it offers detailed ritual prescriptions for how to provide for the gods of Ištar’s temple in Nineveh. The formula to be spoken by the ritual performer is similar to those spoken during the tākultu, so it is certainly possible that this is a ritual prescription for a tākultu performed exclusively in Nineveh. It is also possible that the author of the text chose to go into specific and precise detail regarding ritual performance because the ritual prescription concerned the Emašmaš, the temple of Ištar of Nineveh. Ištar of Nineveh is known to have played a central role in empowering the Assyrian ruler in his office and in mediating between the supreme god Aššur and the king through prophecy, so that the goddess and the king contributed together to securing the cosmic order. Ištar’s importance to the crown prince and the king is explicitly stated only in hymns dating to the time of Ashurbanipal, who claims to have known no father and mother and to have been descended from the Ištars of Nineveh and Arbela instead.67 Allusions to Išar’s roles as goddess prophesying on behalf of the king

and as supporter of the king in his political and military activities, however, are attested as early as the Old Babylonian period.68 Yet it is not until the Sargonid period that Ištar’s prophecies69 emerge as a central stratagem for asserting the legitimacy of irregular succession. In the Götteradressbuch, the Akkadian rendering of the Sumerian ceremonial name of Ištar’s temple in Aššur Egišhurankia, which is ‘House which carries the designs of heaven and earth’ (SAA 20 no. 49:171 bītu ša uṣurāt šamê u erṣetim našû) – clearly indicates her role in revealing the divine plan to the king. This function of Ištar was deemed so important that her cult was introduced in Babylon, where her temple was given the same ceremonial name.70 Interestingly, in Ashurbanipals’s tākultu the section on Ištar and the gods of her temple (SAA 20 no. 40 v 24‒vi 10) again figures right after the section concerned with Aššur; it also includes a prayer to Ištar that beseeches her to accept the offering presented to her and bless the city of Aššur, Assyria, and the king. Accordingly, there appears to have been a deliberate attempt to single out Aššur not only as Assyria’s religious metropolis and as the seat of the chief god Aššur, but also as Assyria’s political capital as the seat of the goddess Ištar. The importance of the tākultu for the state cult is further apparent in the fact that surviving colophons reveal that copies were written by or belonged to either the chief astrologer or the chief exorcist of the king. This is true for the chief astrologer Issar-šumu-ēreš71 and the chief exorcist Kiṣir-Aššur, who consulted the kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal. Issar-šumu-ēreš was involved in the most important cultic affairs and in other highly sensitive matters like the ritual of the substitute king and the return of the Marduk statue to Babylon.72 Beyond his profession as exorcist, the content of Kiṣir-Aššur’s library bespeaks the literary erudition of its owner and his responsibility for organizing the cultic affairs of the Aššur temple. Both Issar-šumu-ēreš and Kiṣir-Aššur would have been very familiar with the conditions of the Aššur temple, and yet the tākultu text for Ashurbanipal (SAA 20 no. 40),73 written by Issar-šumu-ēreš, and the Götteradressbuch (SAA 20 no. 49), written by his

Kiṣir-Aššur’s Götteradressbuch provides precise information regarding the location of particular divinities’ pedestals; in contrast, Issar-šumuēreš’s tākultu for Ashurbanipal (SAA 20 no. 40), represents a sophisticated and elaborate scheme of divine agency focusing on Aššur’s action in concordance with the other gods (discussed below).

10.3.2.2 The Legal Implications of the Tākultu-Ritual
Although the name of the tākultu-ritual suggests a focus on consumption, the text variants make relatively little reference to the preparation of offerings and the feeding of the gods. In this regard, the tākultu-ritual differs profoundly from other Assyrian rituals, which generally provide a detailed guideline for the quantities, preparation, presentation, and distribution of the meals for the gods and the personnel involved.74 Sennacherib’s tākultu is an exception: at the very end, in addition to occasional ritual prescriptions, it dedicates a longer section to ritual performance. Even in this case, however, the emphasis is on the strewing of salt rather than on the preparation of food offerings:
38 v 5‒9 When you are to provide for the House of the God (lit. ‘gods’) of Nineveh, when you are to st[rew] salt, [you say]: “Aššur-Ištar, Sîn, Šam[aš, and Mardu]k, king of the gods, a[ccept] life!”
This is followed by the purification of Ištar’s temple by means of swinging a censer in order “to release” it. While incense is placed on the censer, Ištar is
74 See the discussion of the offerings made in the city of Emar by Sallaberger 2012; for the notion of ritual killing versus sacrifice see Pongratz-Leisten 2007b; for the notion of offering see Pongratz-Leisten 2012.



400 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
invoked and requested to accept the offering and to listen. Salt is strewed on bread and a glass vessel; the same request is made to the gods of Elam, among them the goddess Narudi, who is the earliest attested Elamite divinity. Elamite tradition ultimately ceases to refer to Narudi,75 but Akkadian sources continue to list her together with astral divinities, such as the Sebetti (Šurpu viii 27) and other stars (Šurpu ii 182 f.), as do the tākultu texts (SAA 20 no. 38 ii 35; no. 38 iv 38; iv 58: v 30). Whether attestations of Narudi in invocations represent the actual survival of this deity in the Assyrian cult or simply a literary reflection of an earlier cultic situation cannot be stated with certainty. A similar situation exists with regard to Hurrian divinities (discussed below), some of whom also survive into the Neo-Assyrian period.76 Other gods who are addressed with the request to accept and listen are Nikkal and Kidinbirbir (SAA 20 no. 38 v 3536), Nusku and Bēl (SAA 20 no. 38 v 41‒42), Igigi and Anunnaki, and again Nusku. The same combination of rites, namely the strewing of salt accompanied by the request to the gods to “accept life” followed by the purification of the temple by means of a censer, occurs at the beginning of the Rituals of Šebat (SAA 20 no. 1:12 ff.; no. 2 15′‒23′). The reports referring to these rituals mention a combination of hand-water and strewing of salt (SAA 20 no. 9:18‒19), an offering of plates with salt (SAA 20 no. 9 iii), and an offering of salt along with the pouring of a libation bowl (SAA 20 no. 9 rev. iii 25′). In addition to the long lists invoking the gods of the temples of Aššur, Nineveh, and other cities, the tākultu for Ashurbanipal (SAA 20 no. 40 with dupl. 41), by contrast, mentions the offering of sheep instead of the strewing of salt (SAA 20 no. 40 v 14‒15; 21‒23; rev. ii 22′‒254′; v 23′‒24′, vi 15′). What was the meaning of salt in this ritual context? It appears to entail more than enhancing the taste of cooked meat, as is attested for the offering on the 20th of Nisannu for Bēlat-dunāni (SAA 20 no. 15 ii 41‒42). A letter of Nabû-ušallim (governor of Uruk during the early years of Sennacherib’s reign and responsible for reporting on the activities of the Arameans to the king) mentions a rite involving salt that served to bind the tribes into an alliance, which may illuminate our question:
Anyone who tasted the salt of the tribe of Jakīn (and) from whose mouth you have heard talk of peace, the king, my lord should uproot them so that the land may be well (again).
This reference is reminiscent of the Mari letters, which refer to the Turrukkeans having taken salt (MUN6 ilqû) after their arrival (ARM 4 21:8) – this reference
75 Koch 1999. 76 Pongratz-Leisten 2012.



The Assyrian State Rituals of the Sargonid Period 401
could be interpreted in a similar manner as that of the letter quoted above.77 The use of salt appears to have a legal connotation and serves to bring into force an alliance between the gods and the city of Aššur, Assyria, and the Assyrian king. In other words, strewing salt and burning incense as preparatory acts for the offering are intended to establish a context and determine a framework that has binding implications for all parties. This interpretation finds further support in the textual variant dating to the reign of Aššur-eṭel-ilāni, which starts with the appeal to the gods to drink water or wine: [Aššur], drink! Enlil, drink! Anu, drink! Ea-šarru, drink! Queen of the [Gods], drink! Sîn, drink! Šamaš, drink! Adad, drink! Ištar, drink! etc. (SAA 20 no. 42: I 1 ff.). This recalls Ištar’s asking the gods, her fathers and brothers, to drink water on the occasion of the Meal of the Covenant. In that case, her prophetic message mythologizes the performance of the loyalty oath by transposing political action to the divine level.78 Drinking water and eating (bread with) salt are well suited to the meaning of the lengthy ritual invocations of gods from all over the Assyrian empire as performed in the tākultu-ritual. In practical terms, seeking the blessing of the gods involved an attempt to marshal their support and loyalty and thus connotes a binding force comparable to that of the symbolic gesture of strewing salt:
may they accept (the offerings) and listen (to the prayers), may they bless the city of Aššur, may they bless the land of Assyria, may they bless the king our lord. The manifest gods – you invoke their names in the morning and in the evening (SAA 20 no. 40 iv 4‒8).
The tākultu-ritual aimed at legally binding the gods spread throughout the empire into a relationship of mutual obligations with Aššur, Assyria, the Assyrian king, and each other. This purpose was enhanced by the fact that not only deities but also deified mountains, rivers, and deified regions were requested to pronounce their blessing. Such divinized cosmic features do not normally appear in Assyrian rituals. Instead, their inclusion recalls the Old Babylonian treaties from Tell Leilan and Hittite-Hurrian treaties in which divinized geographical features appear alongside the gods to serve as witnesses for the swearing of oaths.79 This particular view of nature as a “repository for value”80 that wields legal authority in its own right is characteristic of the northern Mesopotamian,

402 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
Hurrian, and West-Semitic traditions.81 As part of Assyrian cultural memory, it resurfaced in the context of the tākultu-ritual, and one of the lengthiest such sections occurs in the tākultu for Aššur-eṭel-ilāni (no. 42, r. iii. 3 ff.). In Sennacherib’s tākultu, the combination of divinized geographical features with Tišpak images (SAA 20 no. 38 i. 39 ff.) and the gods of Subartu (SAA no. 38 i 56‒58), i.e. Hurrian divinities, and with divinities of the eastern Tigridian region (no. 38 iv 1′‒10′) explicitly associates this cultural practice with the erstwhile Hurrian cultural horizon. Accordingly, adoption of this practice can be understood as yet another indication of the reinvention of an older tradition. Such penetration of Hurrian tradition into Assyrian ritual is also apparent in Ashurbanipal’s tākultu, which has a section that lists the Hurrian divinities of the Hābūr area (SAA 20 no. 40 ii 38′‒41′)82 whose cult persisted into the NeoAssyrian period. The invocation of the heavenly bodies at the end of Ashurbanipal’s tākultu (SAA 20 no. 40 vi 15′‒28′) – reminiscent of Assyrian treaties and loyalty oaths can be construed as further evidence of the close association between law and religion. This list of astral bodies is interesting because the tablet on which it is recorded is said to belong to Issar-šumu-ēreš, Ashurbanipal’s chief astrologer and advisor. It is difficult to determine whether the inclusion of heavenly bodies in Ashurbanipal’s tākultu is a product of Issar-šumu-ēreš’s own idiosyncratic choice or whether he intended to invoke these divine stars as further guarantors of the blessed status of Aššur, Assyria, and the Assyrian king in a manner similar to the invocation of the heavenly bodies at the beginning of Esarhaddon’s loyalty oaths (SAA 2 no. 6).
10.3.2.3 The Dynamics of Relational Space
Conceptually, Assyrian rituals endeavored to create a relational space in which all cities and their panthea would be tied to the imperial center, thereby fostering social bonds on a large spatial scale and envisioning a unified territory under divine guidance. This recalls Narām-Sîn’s inscription on the Bassetki Statue,83 in which the Akkadian king similarly creates a sacred topography of the empire by invoking the gods of the Sumerian cities whose rebellion he had previously crushed in a military campaign. Instead of referring to the political elites of the various cities, Narām-Sîn appropriates the patron deities of these cities and depicts them as active contributors to his military and political suc

The Assyrian State Rituals of the Sargonid Period 403
cess. A similar case can be made for Hammurabi in the Prologue to his Law Code, in which he portrays himself as the caretaker of the cults of Babylonia instead of referring to his conquest of the cities of Babylonia.84 Although the tākultu text is a ritual and not a royal inscription, it pursues the same strategy for mapping the empire’s geographical scope. In contrast to the Narām-Sîn text and Hammurabi’s prologue, however, the Assyrian mode of mapping imperial territory draws attention to the Assyrian heartland and its relationship to the rest of the empire. This relationship is unlike the hierarchy of the pantheon as laid down in the god lists, which obviously determined the choice made in Hammurabi’s inscriptions. Ashurbanipal’s tākultu-ritual (SAA 20 no. 40), for instance, begins by invoking the deities of the Aššur temple as well as the deities of other temples in the city of Aššur. It continues by invoking the deities of the temples of the Assyrian royal residences Nineveh and Calah and of the cultic centers of Kurbail, Arbail, and Tua. Subsequently, it proceeds to list the deities in the region of Kilizi and Bīt-Bēlti and moves west to the Hābūr area before turning north and listing the divinities of Urartu together with other established northern Syrian divinities, including Nergal-ofHubšalum and Eblaītu (albeit without reference to their cultic centers). The ritual ends with an invocation of the winds, the gods who rule over the camps, divine weapons, Dahurate, Adad of Rains, Assyrian cities, sanctuaries, frontiers, wastelands, mounds/ruins, the royal throne, the cultic socle, the cella, and the sanctuary of Assyria, as well as of the mountains, springs, and rivers of the four directions. This section is followed by a long blessing, which appears to have stood at the end of the text before Sennacherib’s sack of Babylon. In Sennacherib’s tākultu (SAA 20 no. 38) the last two columns of the text were added later, and they list the gods of Marduk’s temple Esagila and of Babylon, as well as the deities of a nameless city, the city of Der, and yet another unidentified city, before returning to the gods of Nineveh. Ashurbanipal’s tākultu restricts the final list to the gods of Babylon, omitting Der and the other cities before concluding with Aššur. As already mentioned, the author Issar-šumuēreš replaced these omissions by adding a long list of heavenly bodies, includ
84 Roth 1997, 76 ff. Hammurabi’s sequence of cities and divinities does not follow geographical rules. Instead, if one includes the first section describing An and Enlil’s choosing of Ea’s son Marduk as the patron deity of Babylon, the text reflects the contemporary hierarchy of the supra-regional pantheon of Babylonia, with Anu, Enlil, Ea, Marduk (city god of Babylon, capital of Hammurabi’s Babylonia), Sîn (of Ur), Šamaš and Aya (of Sippar and Larsa), Anu and Ištar (of Uruk), Zababa and Ištar (of Kīš), Erra (of Kutha), Tutu (of Borsippa), Uraš (of Dilbat), Mami (of Keš), Ištar goddesses (of Zabalam, Akkad, Nineveh, Babylon), Adad (of Karkar), Ea and Damkina (of Malgium), Dagan (of Mari and Tuttul), Tišpak and Ninazu (of Ešnunna), see also Groneberg 2004, 245.

ing the planets. The political-geographical dimensions laid out in the ritual text reflect the dynamics of a flexible and dynamic imperial border and correspond to Assyrian political realities.85 In its spatial dynamics, the tākultu banquet clearly differs from the Assyrian akītu-festival. The tākultu has an unambiguous centripetal effect,86 drawing divine focus to the imperial center and thereby enhancing the ideological value of regular deliveries to the Aššur temple.
10.3.2.4 The Theological Vision of the Tākultu-Ritual
The unique way in which the divinities of the Assyrian heartland were conceived in the tākultu-ritual merits further attention. Although the genre of the god lists did not motivate the tākultu’s sequence of topographical entries, the geographical mapping of Aššur’s empire in the tākultu-ritual has a theological underpinning of a different kind. All tākultu text variants begin by listing the divinities of the Assyrian cities Aššur, Nineveh, Nimrud, and Arbela, effectively defining the heartland of Assyria proper with Aššur at its very center. The particular theological expression of these texts cannot, however, be considered purely pragmatic. The names of the patron deities of these cities and some other deities are juxtaposed with Aššur, as in Aššur-Ištar, Aššur-Adad, AššurTiara, Aššur-Lahmus, Aššur-Lahmus, Aššur-Conqueror, and Aššur-Šakkan-Tišpak. Assyria’s heartland is thus expressed theologically, and the patron deities and other city deities of the region are represented as extensions of the chief god Aššur. Jan Assmann coined the term hyphenation for this type of divinity in the context of Egyptian theology,87 which must be understood as a tool of systematic description, as there was no such thing as hyphenation in writing in either Egypt or in Mesopotamia. In both cultures the names of the divinities are written side by side such as in dAššur-dEnlil or Horus-Re. As a theological strategy, the juxtaposition of divine names does not imply the same sort of identification as it does in the case of the translatio Graeca. Instead, the second divine element defines a quality or particular manifestation of the divinity. In Assyria, the concept of hyphenation is first apparent during the reign of the Middle Assyrian king Tukultī-Ninurta I, under whom the name Aššur-Enlil was introduced in an effort to consolidate Aššur’s rank as supreme deity while simultaneously demoting the former Sumero-Babylonian chief god Enlil to a secondary position. Because Enlil epitomized the concept of rulership, called

The Assyrian State Rituals of the Sargonid Period 405
Illilūtu, the newly introduced hyphenated name Aššur-Enlil qualified Aššur as the supreme god of Assyria. Excluding the case of Aššur-Enlil, however, hyphenation does not signify that Aššur assumes the qualities of other deities.88 On the contrary, the theological intention in such cases is to define juxtaposed divinities as extensions of Aššur’s agency and thereby to concretize and broaden his scope of action.89 Hyphenation in the Assyrian cultic context of the tākultu-ritual should thus be understood as a sophisticated and typically Assyrian variation on the invocation of a divinity, directed at expressing its particular form of agency. The expression of agency in the invocations performed during the tākultu-ritual – such as in Aššur-Adad, signaling “Aššur-acting-as-thestorm-god-Adad,” Aššur-Ninurta, signaling “Aššur-acting-as-the-warrior-deityNinurta,” and Aššur-Enlil signaling “Aššur-acting-as-the-supreme-god-Enlil” explains the tākultu-ritual’s deviation from the list of divinities presented in the Aššur Directory. The second element in the hyphenated name represents the modifying function defining a particular feature of Aššur’s agency. Hyphenation should thus be understood as a variation of the theological “summodeism” found in hymns of the first millennium BCE, particularly those addressed to Marduk and Ninurta concerned with broadening the scope of divine agency.90 According to Mark Smith, summodeism is a form of theism in which “deities are regarded as aspects or functions of a chief god, with political power often key to its expression.”91 Smith regards summodeism as a theological response to the growth of empires, which supplants the notion of divine translatability that is characteristic of the era of a multiplicity of powers in the ancient Near East during the second millennium BCE. As is clear from the Sumero-Babylonian case, the supra-regional pantheon developed from an amorphous mass of divinities into an integrated whole and was structured after socially familiar patterns such as the family, the royal court and its retinue, and incipient bureaucracy to form a coherent system of action. Polytheism reflects this kind of coherent system of action (Handlungssystem) in which every divinity contributes according to their skill-set to guarantee the functioning of the cosmic order; this system is in continuous flux, reflecting changing historical conditions. In the summodeism of the god lists or hymns of the first millennium BCE, the accumulation of various roles, functions, and qualities in one deity marks the developing consolidation of divine
88 This suggestion was made by Parpola, SAA 9, p. LXXXI, fn. 13. 89 Pongratz-Leisten 2011a; similarly Parpola 2000, 166 who classifies the Assyrian gods other than Aššur as hypostatized powers and attributes. 90 Smith 2008, 170 ff. 91 Smith 2008, 169.



406 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
power in one divine agency. The following oft quoted passage from a first millennium god list must suffice to illustrate the case:
Uraš (is) Marduk of planting Lugalidda (is) Marduk of the abyss Ninurta (is) Marduk of the pickaxe Nergal (is) Marduk of battle Zababa (is) Marduk of warfare Enlil (is) Marduk of lordship and consultations Nabû (is) Marduk of accounting Sîn (is) Marduk who lights up the night Šamaš (is) Marduk of justice Adad (is) Marduk of rain Tišpak (is) Marduk of troops Great Anu (is) Marduk ... Šuqamuna (is) Marduk of the container [ ] (is) Marduk of everything.92
By contrast, the political and cultic realities of Aššur, Nineveh, Arbail, and Nimrud – the Assyrian heartland – are expressed by the various invocations of Aššur in Nineveh, among them Aššur-Aššur as the carrier of Assyrian identity, Aššur-Enlil to index his rank of supreme deity, and Aššur-Ištar representing the mediation of Aššur’s divine command. In Assyria, hyphenation represents a sophisticated variant of the summodeism elaborated by Assyrian scholars in an attempt to combine theology with the spatial dimension of political realities. The invocation of the various aspects of Aššur’s agency in the tākulturitual combines an emphasis on the space represented by the gods of the various cities of the Assyrian empire with the notion of divine agency as an integrated and coherent scheme in which the god Aššur constitutes the overarching and binding principle. Invoking Aššur with this kind of hyphenation in the temples of Aššur, Nineveh, Arbail, and Nimrud thus establishes the unlimited potential of Aššur’s agency and its ability to absorb other gods as extensions of his body and his scope of action. The implied conceptualization of the gods as a fundamental unity comprising complementary and interdependent parts functioning like a single body is further apparent in expressions like “Aššur and the great gods,” which does not grant the other gods with identities separate of that of Aššur. As discussed by Simo Parpola,93 religious expressions of this kind reflect the political relationships that tie the king to his governors and demonstrate the deep interconnectedness of power structures, political ideology, and religion.

The Ritual Cycle of the Months of Šabat ̣u, Addaru and Nisannu 407
The tākultu-ritual’s centripetal dynamic rests exclusively on the invocation of the gods of the empire. This invocation is reminiscent of the invocation of the divinities of the respective treaty partners as witnesses to oath swearing in international treaties, which is preferred to the physical participation of delegations, envoys, or divinities sent as representatives from the periphery to the center. With its long lists of north Syrian, Hurrian, Urartian, and Elamite divinities, the tākultu-ritual demonstrates the authors’ deep engagement with textual and cultic traditions, turning the tākultu-ritual into a deeply intellectual experience. The tākultu-ritual is not concerned with fostering a common identity for the peoples represented by the divinities of the various cities. It lacks any tangible sensory experience, which is generally associated with cultic performance as a means of creating and fostering a community.94 Instead, as a scholastic ritual, the tākultu constructs Assyrian identity by mapping Aššur’s agency onto a mental topography of the Assyrian heartland by means of hyphenated names, in the process drawing divine agency from the conquered regions of the empire into the imperial center through the invocation of the names of their local divinities. Beyond the offerings made to the gods, the only other physical materialization of divine agency is represented in language in the form of the blessing that the gods are to speak in favor of the city of Aššur, Assyria, and the king. By replacing the god Aššur in the original trinity of god-city-land with the figure of the king, the blessing heralds the king’s function as the human agent and extended arm of the god Aššur (mutîr ṭēm A[N.Š]ÁR), as stated in the Tablet of Destines from the time of Sennacherib.95
10.4 The Ritual Cycle of the Months of Šabaṭu, Addaru and Nisannu
Another important ritual complex in the city of Aššur was the large festive cycle that began in the eleventh month, Šabaṭu, and ended with the akītufestival in the first month of the year, Nisannu. This ritual complex, constructed out of various major cultic ceremonies, demonstrates how Assyrian scholars reshaped and reinvented rituals in the Sargonid period by linking the royal ancestor cult with the king’s re-investiture and the akītu-festival to define the king’s role in the cosmic scheme. The ritual complex of the month Šabaṭu ap

pears to have been introduced by Aššurnaṣirpal II, who dedicated it to the warrior god Ninurta. Along with the Ninurta festival celebrated in the month of Šabaṭu, Aššurnaṣirpal II also established a ritual complex for Ninurta in the month of Elulu:
I adorned the room of the shrine of the god Ninurta, my lord, with gold and lapis lazuli, I stationed bronze .... On his right and left, (and) installed wild ferocious dragons of gold at his throne. I appointed his festivals in the months of Šebat (and) Elul. The name of his festival in the month Šebat I called ‘Splendor’. I established for them food (and) incense offerings. I created my royal monument with a likeness of my countenance of red gold (and) sparkling stones (and) stationed (it) before the god Ninurta, my lord.96
The choice of the months Šabaṭu and Elulu was probably motivated by astral observations, as in the eleventh month Sirius, the star of Ninurta, “stands exactly in the south at sunset and in the sixth month it stands there at sunrise.”97 In this case, the astral opposition presents an image of symmetry and cosmic balance, which is also evident in the Hymn to Ninurta as Sirius:98
O greatest Ninurta, warrior god, vanguard of the Anuna-gods, commander of the Igigi-gods, Judge of the universe, who oversees (its) opposition = equilibrium, Who makes bright darkness and illumines gloom, Who renders verdicts (pāris purussê) for teeming mankind!
O my splendid lord, who satisfies the needs of the land, ...
Who grasps truth and justice and destroys [...], Indefatigable arrow (šukūdu) that [kills] all enemies, Great storm, who grasps the leadrope [of heaven and netherworld], Judge of verdicts (dayyān purussê), diviner of oracle[s ...] (bārû têrēti) Conflagration that incinerates and burns up the wick[ed ], Whose name in heaven is “Arrow Star,” Whose name is greatest among the Igigi-gods, Among all your gods your divinity is doubled.99 At the rising of the stars your face shines like the sun. ...

In this hymn the notion of cosmic balance is apparent in Ninurta’s roles as judge and warrior, which work to secure civic order and were defined as the primary duties of the king in Late Assyrian ideology.100 Although in the Šabaṭu cycle as reconceptualized under Ashurbanipal, Ninurta only appears in procession on the 10th of Šabaṭu and otherwise plays no major role, everything suggests that in this ritual complex the king emulates Ninurta’s role as warrior deity and that his installation as king was thought to parallel Ninurta’s investiture as recounted in mythological narratives and exegetical texts like SAA 3 no. 39.101 While not necessarily tied to the coronation ceremony, the Šabaṭu cycle can be interpreted as re-enacting the king’s investiture and thus as annually reconfirming the king’s claim to wield legitimate power and authority over Assyria. It is in the prescriptive rituals relating to the Šabaṭu Cycle (SAA 20 nos. 16), the Reports on Rituals Performed by Ashurbanipal in Šebat-Addar 650 (SAA 20 nos. 9‒11), and the Manual for Chanters (SAA 20 no. 12) from the reign of Ashurbanipal that the rituals of the months Šabaṭu, Addaru, and Nisannu become recognizable as components of a complex whole centered on human and divine kingship. Further evidence for the unity of these ritual complexes comes from a tablet listing the cultic reforms undertaken by Sennacherib (SAA 20 no. 52 and related fragments) recovered from the House of the Exorcists at Aššur. Together with their scholars, Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal went to great lengths to reorganize the ritual cycle of the city of Aššur and to integrate the royal office in the overarching cosmic scheme. The following observations build on Stefan Maul’s detailed and comprehensive description of the festive cycle.102 It must be stressed that both the prescriptive rituals and the ritual reports have breaks, which makes it difficult to determine the extent to which their ritual syntax corresponds. Major distinctions are, however, apparent with regard to the days on which certain rituals are performed, cultic locales, some of the rites themselves, and the sequence of rites. Prescriptive ritual texts survive for the period between the 18th and 25th of Šabaṭu. The ritual reports, by contrast, describe rites for the period between the 16th and 20th of Šabaṭu and for the 3rd, 8th, 9th, and 10th of Addaru. The cultic reform texts refer to the processions of Aššur and the gods: on the 22nd of Šabaṭu Aššur goes to the bīt Dagan and on the 23rd of Šabaṭu Aššur’s chariot leaves for the bīt Dagan.

410 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
Regarding cultic locales, in the prescriptive rituals performance moves between the king’s palace, the Aššur temple, and the bīt Dagan (in the Old Palace). In the ritual reports, by contrast, the bīt Dagan is mentioned only for the 16th of Šabaṭu, while in the cultic reforms (SAA 20 no. 52 rev. ii 36′) it appears only for the 22nd of Šabaṭu. In the ritual reports, moreover, ritual performance moves between the king’s palace, the Aššur temple, and the Anu-Adad temple. The visit to the bīt dDagan/dugani must have been central to the beginning of the festive cycle; the ritual prescriptive texts provide a detailed description of the rites performed during this visit and while the king moved between the palace and the bīt Dagan. G. van Driel103 originally suggested that the bīt Dagan should be equated with the bīt hurše in the Aššur temple, but this view was rejected by Brigitte Menzel, who thought it was in the Old Palace, before Karlheinz Deller again identified the bīt Dagan with the slaughterhouse or kitchen in the Aššur temple.104 Because ritual performance centers primarily on two locations, namely the palace and the Aššur temple, I am inclined to follow Menzel and locate the bīt Dagan in the Old Palace. There were two palaces in Aššur, the so-called Old Palace and the New Palace. The latter, originally built in the Middle Assyrian period, was still used by Aššurnaṣirpal II before he built his new palace at Nimrud. Since the ritual refers to the performance of the kispu-offering in the Aššur temple on the 18th – probably for the ancestors – and since six tombs were uncovered in the southeastern part of the Old Palace, of which three were identified as belonging to Šamšī-Adad V (Gruft II), Aššur-bēl-kala (Gruft III), and Aššurnaṣirpal II (Gruft V),105 it is likely that é.gal denotes the Old Palace. According to several inscriptions found in the area of the Old Palace, the New Palace, and the Aššur temple, Sennacherib was also buried in Aššur. One inscription is particularly revealing with regard to the meaning attributed to the burial place of the Assyrian kings as a place of social identification and consolidation of the dynastic line:
(This is) the palace of repose (bīt tapšuhti), the dwelling for eternity (šubat dārât), house of the dynasty (bīt kimti) which is firmly grounded, of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the universe, king of Assyria.106

The Ritual Cycle of the Months of Šabat ̣u, Addaru and Nisannu 411
The assumption that the bīt Dagan was located in the Old Palace, is further corroborated by two Middle Assyrian administrative documents that mention the offering of red wool for the weapons of some deceased Middle Assyrian kings107 on the occasion of the “return of the god” (tuʾāri ili); this offering took place in the palace (é.gal). According to the observations of Peter Miglus, the burials of the late Middle Assyrian king Aššur-bēl-kala and the Neo-Assyrian kings were situated exactly where the Old Palace of the Old Assyrian period had its throne room or major hall. Such architectural organization evokes the traditions known from Amorite Mari and Tuttul, which equally combined royal residence and royal burials, and links the practice of the Assyrian ancestor cult with the Syrian cultural horizon.108 Further links with Syrian tradition can be observed in the kispu-offering performed in the Aššur temple to honor the royal ancestors; it is reminiscent of the Amorite tradition attested in the text known as the Genealogy of Hammurabi. In this text the living king, whether at the moment of his investiture or as part of an annual ritual, honors the ancestors and members of the Babylonian royal dynasty by reciting the list of the ancestral names and performing the offering for the dead. It is worth noting in this context that two of the five versions of the Neo-Assyrian King List were written on tablets whose format resembles amulet tablets,109 suggesting that they were used within a cultic context and possibly also read during the kispu ceremony. Genealogies are easily manipulated,110 and both the Genealogy of Hammurabi and the Assyrian King List primarily serve to promote the view that the institution of kingship was continuous and unbroken, thereby contributing to the reinvention of tradition.111 The kispu ceremony generally consisted of a communal meal with the ancestors, which not only served the needs of the dead but also consolidated the social position of the head of the family by regularly reaffirming social hierarchies. In the case of the king, the successfully performed kispu ceremony was an additional form of cognitive reliability112 that reinforced his place within the dynastic line of the kings of Aššur. Communication with the ancestors by means of the kispu-offering must have had a transformative effect, as when the king enters the bīt Dagan he

412 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
wears the Tiara of Aššur (Bēl-Agû) on his head. Aššur’s tiara as a symbol of Assyrian world dominion represents still another central aspect of the rites performed during the month of Šabaṭu. Only the ritual prescriptions allude to the governor, queen, crown prince, and grand treasurer providing for the wedding ceremony of Mullissu (quršu ša dMullissu, see SAA 20 no. 1 r. 18; no. 2 ii 8′, iii 35′); this wedding ceremony is not mentioned in the ritual reports of Ashurbanipal. In a theogamy the goddess generally intercedes with her consort on behalf of the king to secure divine blessing for his rulership,113 so the inclusion of Mullissu’s wedding ceremony (quršu) perfectly suits the purpose of this ritual component, which aims at celebrating and reaffirming the king’s rulership through divine consent. A large part of SAA 20 no. 1 is broken, but the preserved part refers to rites performed on the 20th of Šabaṭu. The king enters the bīt Dagan wearing Bēl-Agû on his head, while the gods accompanying him are identified as Aššur, Mullissu, Bēl-Agû, Sîn, Šamaš, Anu, Adad, Nergal, the Chariots-of-War, Šerua, Kippat-māti, Kakka, Mandanu, the Conquerors (Kāšidūti), the deified weapon (dKakku), and the deified Axe (dKalappu). These gods largely overlap with the list of gods walking in procession and driving on the chariot to the akītu-house in Nisannu (compare SAA 20 no. 1: r. 20‒24 and no. 54). The symbolic meaning of this configuration of deities walking in procession suggests that this ritual component connoted the symbolic re-enactment of Aššur-Ninurta’s/the king’s victorious battle against the forces of chaos. Along with some other divinities, the same gods are mentioned in the text describing the image of Aššur’s battle against Tiāmat on Sennacherib’s bronze door for the akītu-house, in which it is stated explicitly that the divine weapon and the Kāšidūti travel together with Aššur on his chariot.114 Not only the procession itself but also the group of gods accompanying Aššur communicated a standardized narrative that applied to the supreme god of the imperial pantheon, Aššur in the case of Assyria and Marduk in the case of Babylonia; the outcome of this standardized narrative was common knowledge among the participants. The procession, consequently, functioned as an effective means for materializing the combat myth and reinforcing imperial theology. On the 23rd of Šabaṭu the king performed an Opening-of-the-Mouth ritual that reaffirmed his status. On the 24th of Šabaṭu the king went to the Aššur temple and illuminated the face of the gods He performed offerings before Aššur and Mullissu and provided for the gods of the Aššur temple in the bīt Dagan. In addition, the king accompanied Aššur to the bīt Dagan, performed further offerings, and then returned to the palace (SAA 20 no. 3).

The Ritual Cycle of the Months of Šabat ̣u, Addaru and Nisannu 413
The ritual reports appear to describe a different syntax for the ritual cycle. First of all, they do not mention the kispu-offering in the bīt Dagan and all the rites centered on Bēl-Agû are moved to the 20th of Šabaṭu and the 3rd and 8th of Addaru. For the 16th of Šabaṭu (not extant in the prescriptive ritual texts), the ritual reports record the entry of Šerua, Kippat-māti, and Tašmētu into the bīt Dagan. It is possible that this visit of the female goddesses implies their role as mediators who intercede with the ancestors on behalf of the king. On the following day the king entered the city (SAA 20 no. 10), and on the 18th of Šabaṭu he made offerings before Aššur and Bēl-Agû in the Aššur temple as well as before Aššur of the Reading, Kippat-māti, and possibly some other divinities whose names are not preserved (SAA 20 no. 10: 11‒24). Further offerings took place before Ninurta and Nusku, the gods of the Aššur temple, the Conquerors (Kāšidūti), the Golden Chariot (of Aššur), and Bēl and Nabû. On the 19th of Šabaṭu further offerings took place before Aššur and Mullissu and the priests circumambulated the Aššur temple and all the other temples. On this day, the king accompanied the goddesses Šerua, Kippat-māti, and Tašmētu into the Anu temple. Since this visit took place on the day before the king was to wear Bēl-Agû on his head, it is tempting to assume that it implied a negotiation of the king’s legitimate status in the presence of the divine assembly of Anu in which the female goddesses interceded on the king’s behalf. On the 20th of Šabaṭu the king escorted Aššur and his consort Mullissu together with Bēl-Agû to the dais of destinies (parak šīmāte). While no commentaries on this particular rite are extant, this gathering of Aššur, Mullissu, and Bēl-Agû may be considered the Assyrian version of the Babylonian assembly of the gods who acknowledge and confirm the king in his office at their first gathering during the Babylonian akītu on the 8th of Nisannu. The gathering of Aššur, Mullissu, and Bēl-Agû is in all likelihood to be distinguished from the assembly of all the gods (puhur ilāni) that took place on the 3rd of Addaru. The arrival of the gods at the dais of destinies had a transformative effect on the king, who wore Aššur’s tiara on his head on the following day – the 22nd of Šabaṭu – and drove to the bīt Dagan on a chariot. It is not clear whether it was only at this point that king performed the kispu to his royal ancestors, as no mention of this is made in the surviving texts. A transformation in the king’s status must nevertheless have occurred, as on that day he was crowned with Aššur’s tiara. When it was paraded in procession, Aššur’s tiara communicated the legitimate claim to power of its bearer. The king’s reconfirmation as legitimate occupant of the throne entitled him to undergo the mouth washingritual (ka.luh.ù.da) on the 23rd of Šabaṭu, itself designed to turn him into the body politic and holder of the royal office.115 The mouth washing-ritual was
115 On the body politic of the Assyrian king see the discussion in Chapter Six.



414 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
generally intended to transform the statue of either the king or the gods into an agent on their behalf. In this case, however, the ritual serves as a potent means of ritual transformation whereby the king becomes an official body politic and so reaffirms his own power, status, and authority as the god Aššur’s agent. As is discussed in Chapter Six, the king’s role as Aššur’s agent consisted of the emulation of Ninurta’s role as steward. This role included the executive aspect of power, particularly the obligation to extend the borders of the Assyrian empire in order to align them with the boundaries of the known universe, a duty also communicated in the Assyrian coronation ritual. As such, it is perhaps unsurprising that a cultic commentary associates the 23rd of Šabaṭu with battle.116 It is not necessary to assume, however, that the king performed an actual battle ritual to demonstrate his abilities as war lord or hunter, as described in ritual no. 18.117 As noted in the commentary, the implication of the king’s ritual performance during the months of Šabaṭu and Addaru was his rightful and legitimate participation in the establishment of cosmic order by assuming the warrior aspect of Aššur, i.e. Aššur-Ninurta. Seeing the two war chariots and Aššur’s deified weapons, dkakku and dkalapu, during the procession of the gods accompanying Aššur to the bīt Dagan – in addition to seeing the head of the sea-monster (mentioned in no. 52 v 47′‒48′) – sufficed to materialize and evoke the cosmic battle in the minds of both the participants and the observers and functioned to trigger the memory of the narrative of Marduk/ Aššur fighting Tiāmat as recounted in Enūma Eliš. The king’s assumption of Aššur’s crown on the 24th of Šabaṭu provided a similar cue, as is revealed by the same commentary, which identifies that day as the day on which the king wears the crown of Aššur.118 The crown as icon communicates the outcome of the combat myth’s standardized narrative in a condensed form to the viewer, in which Aššur-Ninurta or Marduk becomes king of the universe after fighting a victorious battle.119 As a “signature element”120 of divine rulership, Aššur’s crown does not simply announce that the king’s rulership is divinely sanctioned but transforms the king into an extension of Aššur’s agency, merging divine and human kingship in a single unitary intentionality. On the 26th of Šabaṭu the image of Aššur that had remained in the bīt Dagan throughout the preceding four days returned to the Aššur temple.

The Ritual Cycle of the Months of Šabat ̣u, Addaru and Nisannu 415
At some point between the 23rd of Šabaṭu and the 3rd of Addaru the king opened the vat, a rite that the cultic commentary SAA 3 no. 37: 18′ explains as Marduk defeating Tiāmat with his penis. According to the ritual reports, the bīt Dagan and the Aššur temple functioned as the main cultic localities in the month of Addaru. The festive cycle continued on the 1st of Addaru with offerings to Aššur, and on the following day to Mullissu. On the 3rd of Addaru the gods again made their way to the bīt Dagan in a procession in order to assemble (puhur ilāni) and probably to confirm divine and earthly rulership.121 The 8th of Addaru represented a pivotal moment in the festive cycle. After his performance of offerings before Aššur and Mullissu, the king accompanied both gods to the Anu temple where the tiara was placed on the socle of Aššur. Like the 24th of Šabaṭu, the 8th of Addaru is called the “day on which the king wears Aššur’s crown”122 in the cultic commentary. Wearing Aššur’s tiara, the king left the Aššur temple through the Kalkal gate, which links the southwestern courtyard with Sennacherib’s newly built additional courtyard,123 and re-entered the temple through the same gate – thus moving into the semi-public sphere of the outer courtyard of the temple. When Esarhaddon finished his renovations to the Aššur temple, he held a banquet in this courtyard for three days, to which he invited his magnates and his people.124 Regardless of who precisely is meant by “his people,” the king’s remark reveals that at least part of the population had access to the outer courtyard of the temple. The king’s leaving and re-entering through the Kalkal gate must have served the purpose of integrating the public sphere into the ritual space and thus publicizing the king’s active partaking in the divine and terrifying splendor radiated by Aššur’s crown. The king’s spatial movement involving semi-public space was reinforced by the incantations “The crown’s terrifying splendor” and “the Weapon,” recited by the exorcists (SAA 20 no. 11 r. 4). Both evoke the image of Aššur’s overwhelming splendor spreading throughout the universe and forcing everyone to submit to his yoke. Together with Aššur, Šerua, Kippat-māti, Tašmētu, the Axe and Mandanu, the king went to the Adad temple, stopping at the cella of Anu (SAA 20 no. 11 r. 5 ff) before returning to the Aššur temple on the same day.
121 As noted by Maul 2000, 397 f. this assembly of the gods was already known under Adadnīrārī III, see SAA 12 no. 69: 27 ff. Here the rites for Šabatu and intercalary Addaru are called pandugāni ša šarri. There is no attestation for a pandugani ša šarri, which according to Deller 1985‒86, 47 seems to have been a banquet of a more secular kind, after Adad-nīrārī III. 122 SAA 3 no. 40 rev. 16. 123 Van Driel 1969, 47. 124 RINAP 4 no. 57 vii 26‒30.



416 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
On the 9th of Addaru a ritual took place that seems to have been designed to add to the materialization of the changed status of the king. The king came out of the palace and stood in the courtyard, where the priest placed a vat of vine before him and then placed a peeled pomegranate on a platter of salt. This pomegranate was then put in the mouth of the cupbearer, who was brought before the king. The head of the female singers announced the good news three times before entering the temple of Anu: “Šerua has given birth!” The king then entered the temple of Adad, lit the censer, and illuminated the face of the god. The peeled red pomegranate possibly symbolizes the female blood and the white salt the male semen, thus visualizing the idea of a sexual reunion before the announcement “Šerua has given birth!” and indicating the king’s new status.125 By means of the ritual just described, the king’s changed status was emphasized during Ashurbanipal’s reign at the expense of the notion of the divine couple blessing and legitimizing the king in his office as effectuated by the wedding ceremony of Mullissu. On the 10th of Addaru the king set the table and gave gifts to the templeenterers. Overall, it seems that the reforms undertaken during the reign of Ashurbanipal emphasize the king’s position as agent of the god Aššur – visualized by the king’s wearing of Aššur’s Tiara – even more strongly than do the prescriptive rituals that probably date to the reign of Sennacherib.
10.5 The Akītu-festival in Aššur
On the 18th of Addaru a further section of the ritual complex ended, beginning again on the 2nd of Nisannu with the akītu-festival. The Assyrian endeavor to reformulate older rituals and imbue them with new meaning also applies to the Assyrian akītu-festival. As with the tākultu-ritual, the earliest evidence for an Assyrian akītu-festival dates from the period of Šamšī-Adad I (1808‒1776 BCE), who ordered his son Yasmah-Adad in Mari to send mules and horses for an akītu-festival in Aššur on the 16th of Addaru.126 There is no other evidence for such a festival in Aššur until the reign of Sennacherib, who reintroduced the akītu-festival following his destruction of Babylon in 681 BCE.127 The reincorporation of Babylonia into the Assyrian empire did not only result in the reformulation of Assyrian political ideology. Under Sennacherib, the scholars

The Akı̄tu-festival in Aššur 417
of the king reinforced and elaborated on the theological discourse centered on Aššur, the chief god of the Assyrian pantheon. From the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I onward, Aššur, written AN.ŠÁR (‘universe of the Heaven’), acquired increasing astral dimensions that matched the king’s imperial claim to universal control.128 Materializing Aššur’s astralization was central to Sennacherib’s reorganization of the cult of Aššur and is reflected in the architecture of his temple, as is discussed in detail below. In this endeavor Sennacherib relied to some extent on the Babylonian model of the god Marduk, transferring some of the Marduk theology to the Assyrian god Aššur. Under Sennacherib, Assyrian scholars rewrote the Enūma Eliš so that Aššur rather than Marduk now figured as its protagonist,129 clutching the Tablet of Destinies to his chest.130 Furthermore, Sennacherib institutionalized the annual performance of the akītu-festival, for which he reshaped Aššur’s cultic topography.131 Sennacherib added the Eastern Annex to Aššur’s cella in the Aššur temple in order to house the dais of destinies, where the fates were determined. This architectural undertaking is described at length in several inscriptions and the required changes to the layout of Aššur’s cella could only be implemented after the permission of the gods had been obtained by means of extispicy, as the following passage relates:132
In the wisdom which Ea bestowed on me, with the cleverness with which Aššur endowed me, I took counsel with myself alone, and to open the gate of Ehursaggalkurkurra to the East instead of the South, my heart moved me. The will of Šamaš and Adad I sought to learn (by extispicy) and they gave me a firm positive answer; that that door should open towards the East instead of the South, Šamaš and Adad commanded. On that day, I cut through its wall and toward the breast of Aššur, my lord, instead of the South, I opened a new door, and I called its name Gate of Royalty.133
The above passage from one of Sennacherib’s inscriptions demonstrates the king’s awareness that the adaptation of mythical, theological, and ritual concepts required changes to the existing ground plan of the Aššur temple. This

418 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
is one of the finest examples in the archaeological record and in textual sources of the close relationship between ritual and cultic topography. Sennacherib’s extensive reconceptualization of Aššur’s theology and cult is thus evident in five actions, namely 1) the rewriting of Enūma Eliš to provide the Assyrian chief god with a history that fostered his position as supreme god, 2) the writing of Aššur’s name with the logogram AN.ŠÁR, i.e. the name of one of the primeval gods preceding Marduk/Aššur in Enūma Eliš, 3) the transformation of the Aššur temple in order to integrate the socle of destinies necessary for the celebration of the akītu-festival, 4) the building of the akītu-house outside Aššur, and 5) the introduction of the akītu-festival itself.134 The composition of the Marduk Ordeal, which explicitly places Aššur/AN.ŠÁR as prior to the creation of heaven and earth while Marduk emerges only after city and temple had come into being,135 served to establish Aššur’s transcendent character, apparent also in his epithet “the one who creates himself” (bānû ramānīšu).136 Several new cultic texts were concerned with the performance of the akītu-festival and the hierarchy of the gods who marched in procession alongside Aššur.137 In his inscriptions, Sennacherib strives to present his cultic reforms as religiously motivated and embeds them in a new astral-cosmic symbolism. This astral symbolism applies to his capital Nineveh, the plan of which was said to be drawn for eternity in the constellations (šiṭir burumme, lit. “writing of the firmament”).138 It also characterizes the toponymy of the newly annexed courtyard in Aššur, which represents an astral commentary on the determination of destinies during the akītu-festival and simultaneously emphasizes Aššur’s universal rulership (bāb šarrūti “gate of royalty”).139 The external gate in the southeast of the annexed courtyard (bāb burumme “gate of the firmament”) and the southeast gate leading into the temple complex called “the door of the road of Enlil” (bāb harrān šūt dEnlil) reflect the astral aspect of Aššur, who is said to dwell in the shining firmament in the inscriptions of Sennacherib.140 Aššur’s consort Mullissu is referred to in the name of the “gate of the wagon star” (bāb mulereqqi). The astronomical manual MUL.APIN associates the mulereqqi with the Sumerian goddess Ninlil, the consort of Enlil, who was equated with Mullissu in the Neo-Assyrian period.

tieth of Šabaṭu Aššur took his seat on the “socle of destinies” (parak šīmāte, SAA 20 no. 9 i 23) together with Mullissu and Bēl-Agû. The courtyard name “courtyard of the row of the stations of the Igigi” (kisal sidir manzāz dIgigi) and the gate names “gate of the entrance of the Igigi” (bāb nēreb dIgigi) and “gate of the prostrating Igigi” (bāb kamṣū dIgigi) refer to the great gods’ attendance during Aššur’s procession to the akītu-house and, according to Enūma Eliš, to the acclamation of Marduk/Aššur as king of the gods. As it was celebrated in Babylonia, the akītu-festival originally served to visualize and commemorate the victory of the chief god Marduk over the forces of chaos. Marduk’s victory resulted in the creation of the cosmos and his uncontested rise to the position of chief god of the Babylonian pantheon. The text was rewritten with Aššur replacing Marduk as the chief protagonist and the ritual, in addition, provided the perfect foil for the king who, while accompanying the chief god in his cosmic role as defender of the civilized world against the forces of chaos, annually reconsolidated his own position and concomitantly stabilized and consolidated the existing social and civic order. Cultic performance thus established a timeless continuity between the mythic past and the present, and history was, in a sense, abolished. As is discussed above, similar mythic concepts are articulated in the festive cycle of Aššur; the Assyrians, however, used the akītu-ritual to legitimize “changed political arrangements.”141 Esarhaddon chose the akītu-festival as the moment for the performance of the loyalty oath on behalf of his younger son and future king Ashurbanipal, whom Esarhaddon favored at the expense of his older brother Šamaš-šum-ukīn. The swearing of the oath probably took place in the Nabû temple in the presence of Marduk and Nabû, as is suggested by a letter sent to Esarhaddon regarding Ashurbanipal’s appointment as crown prince and by the ivories found in the so-called throne room of the Nabû temple that depict the performance of the loyalty oath:142
The scribes of the cities of Nin[eveh], Kilizi, and Arbela (could) ent[er] the treaty; they have (already) come. (However), those of Aššur [have] not (yet) come. The king, my lord, [knows] that they are cler[gymen143]. If it pleases the king my lord, let the former, who have (already) come, enter the treaty; the citizens of Nineveh and Calah would be free soon (and) could enter (the treaty/loyalty oath) under (the statues of) the gods Bēl and Nabû on the 8th day (of Nisannu).

420 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
In Babylonia, the performance of the akītu-festival extended over a period of eleven or twelve days. Its climax was the procession of the gods who, after having assembled on the dais of destinies in Marduk’s temple in Babylon in order to determine the fate of the king of the gods, left the temple and proceeded toward the akītu-house located outside the city. The procession symbolized Marduk’s battle against Tiāmat, as is apparent in the ceremonial name of the akītu-house, which is “House that binds the sea (Tiāmat)” (é.(a).ab.ba.ug5.ga).144 In order to enact the procession according to the Babylonian model in Assyria, Sennacherib had to build the akītu-house outside of Aššur, an act that he presents as a restoration of ancient customs.145 There are no surviving Assyrian ritual texts that describe the procession in detail. The Calendar of Psalms and Lamentations in the Aššur Temple,146 the tablet of the Cultic Reforms and Religious Practices at Aššur,147 a text similar to it,148 and a duplicate149 do, however, list the gods that accompany Aššur into the akītu-house while marching in front or behind his chariot. The mythological connotations of the procession in Aššur are more or less identical to those of the procession in Babylonia, the only major difference being the substitution of Aššur for Marduk as the champion who defeats Tiāmat. In contrast to the Babylonian tradition, there is no evidence for the splitting of the Assyrian procession into a number of different stages,150 nor is there any attestation of gods visiting from other cities of the empire in order to attend the procession, as was envisioned in the centripetal Babylonian model. Instead, the spatial focus in the Assyrian procession is on the god Aššur as patron deity of the city of Aššur and as chief god of Assyria. The procession of the gods led through the city walls to the outskirts of the city where the festival house was located, generally at a distance of less than half a mile from the city itself.151 The festival house for the city of Aššur was newly built by Sennacherib
144 Pongratz-Leisten 1994, 75 after A. R. George NABU 1993/43. For other readings of the Sumerian ceremonial name of the akītu-house see A. Livingstone NABU 1990/87 and Frahm 1997, 224 T 184. 145 Ebeling 1954, no. 1. 146 SAA 20 no. 12 r. 19‒28. 147 SAA 20 no. 52 iv –v 16′. 148 SAA 20 no. 53 i 1′ – ii 31′. 149 SAA 20 no. 54. 150 Pongratz-Leisten 1994, 37‒84. 151 This is true for Aššur and Uruk, where the precise location of the akītu houses has been identified.



The Akı̄tu-festival in Aššur 421
despite the fiction that he merely renovated it.152 Because of its location outside of the city walls, the akītu-house was symbolically associated with the steppe, the realm of chaos. Although in reality the festival house was located in the suburbs or in the agricultural belt surrounding the city, any site outside of the city walls was symbolically associated with the notion of chaos, a point underscored by the name of the festival house, sometimes called ‘akītu-house of the steppe’ (bīt akīti ša ṣēri). In the mental mapping of the festival, land beyond the city walls is not considered part of the territory controlled by the king and the god. Therefore, the steppe as the realm of chaos functions as the perfect setting for the battle against Tiāmat,153 since this battle could not take place in the city itself, which was of course the paradigm of both social and cosmic order. This interpretation of the procession as a performative setting for some kind of “cultic drama” is supported by the Assyrian ritual texts of the akītufestival, which mention a monster.154 Instead of performing the battle in mimetic representation as known from the Greek model, Assyro-Babylonian tradition appears to associatively reenact the cosmic battle by assigning symbolic meaning to ritual gestures and reciting liturgical songs referencing the mythic event. The god’s victory over Tiāmat and his procession back to his temple in his city thus symbolize his adventus in the city and serve to visualize and stabilize his supreme position in the divine hierarchy anew, year after year. Accordingly, the procession symbolizes a change in the status of the chief god: by returning to his temple in the city following his victorious excursion beyond the city walls, the chief god can legitimately claim his supreme position within the pantheon. Like its Babylonian counterpart, the Assyrian akītu-festival appears to have extended over eleven days. More detailed information is available in only two texts, one of which belonged to Marduk-kabti-ilāni, chief šangû of Aššur and offspring of a family of priests in Aššur,155 and the other of which is a text fragment156 similar to the Cultic Reforms and Religious Practices at Aššur.157 SAA 20 no. 53 i 16′-ii 30′ begins with a ritual prescription for the 2nd of Nisannu,

In Babylonia, by contrast, it seems to have been evoked by means of songs performed by the kurgarru and assinnu-mimes Pongratz-Leisten 1994, 74 ff.

422 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
the day on which the king offers cooked meat before Aššur. Subsequently, the chariot driver (LÚ.mukīl appāte) carries the god on his chariot, drawn by white horses, in a ceremonial procession to the akītu-house while a singer intones several songs. The text is very fragmentary, but it seems that the god Aššur does not remain in the akītu-house and returns to his own temple in the city of Aššur. In a very fragmentary section, mention is made of the Ubšukkinakku and the monster. The respective exegetical comment in the cultic commentary reads as follows:
SAA 3 no. 37 24′‒28′ [The chariots] which they dispatch, and the ‘third man’ who [puts] the whip in [the king’s] hand, takes him by the hand, leads him into the presence of the god and shows the whip to the god and the king, is Nabû, who is sent against Illil and defeats him, whom Nergal to[ok] by the hand, introduced into Esaggil and showed the weapon in his hand to Marduk, king of the gods, and Zarpanitu, while they kissed and blessed [him].
Here the commentary appears to conflate the combat myth and parricide, or at least the demotion of an older god. Theogony involving parricide or the demotion of the ancestor gods by a god representing the younger generation is a mythic stratagem used as an explanatory pattern for the organization of power and perhaps even for the fact of usurpation. While this stratagem is not indigenous to Sumero-Babylonian thought, it does appears to structure the myth of the Theogony of Dunnu,158 which is linked to the mythology centered on the Hurrian god Kumarbi.159 The high priest’s tablet (SAA 20 no. 15) appears to have been some kind of an excerpt tablet combining ritual prescriptions for the 7th and 8th of Nisannu and for the tākultu-ritual, with the latter listing the same sequence of cities that is displayed in other tākultu texts, i.e. Nineveh, Aššur, Kilizi, Arbail, Nimrud, Tarbiṣu, Kurbail, Tue, Harran, and Nineveh again. The text then covers days seven and eight of the akītu-festival, noting intriguingly that the ritual performance could be carried out ‘whether in Nineveh, or in Nimrud, or in an enemy country’ (SAA 20 no. 15 i. 55′‒56′). This suggests that the king did not necessarily have to remain in Aššur for the entirety of the akītu-festival. Unfortunately, the beginning of the tablet is destroyed; it does, however, look like the gods had already entered the akītu-house by the 7th of Nisannu at the latest, as the first date mentioned in the following is the 8th of Nisannu (SAA 20 no. 15 i 55′), which according to the information gleaned from the cultic commentary

The Akı̄tu-festival in Aššur 423
Fig. 56: Stele of Aššurnaṣirpal II, Nimrud (after Orthmann 1975, fig. 197).
SAA 3 no. 37, includes a number of the ritual gestures performed by the king, which symbolically reflect Marduk’s cosmic battle. From Sennacherib’s description of Assur’s battle against Tiāmat as depicted on the gate of the akītuhouse, we know that the gods accompanied Aššur into battle in a prescribed order. Because this battle ultimately entails Marduk’s/Aššur’s ascent to the position of supreme deity of the Babylonian pantheon and the relegation of both the older generation of gods (including Anu, Enlil and Ea) and their sons to an inferior position, the commentaries explain the king’s ritual performance as mirroring Marduk’s performance of parricide. An interesting detail in the ritual prescriptions is the reference made to the pectoral “of the gods” that the king wears around his neck during the ritual performance. This pectoral appears to be similar to the one Aššurnaṣirpal II wears on his stele from Nimrud160 (fig. 56) and on the relief representing him in front of the sacred tree in the throne room of his palace (fig. 22).161 In both

424 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
cases the pectoral consists of a row of divine symbols like those generally depicted on the Assyrian victory steles, thus conjuring the presence of the most important deities of the Assyrian pantheon: Sîn, Šamaš, Ištar, Aššur-EnlilAnu?, and Adad. The commentary elucidates the pectoral’s protective power in the following terms: “The king, who wears the jewelry and roasts young virgin goats, is Marduk, who wearing his armor burnt the sons of Enlil and Ea in fire (SAA 3 no. 37: 16′‒17′).162 In the ritual text fragment SAA 20 no. 15, the king lights a censer and steps upon a pedestal, following which a man-woman (lú!.sal) raises the weapon and shouts “Ebirna! Ebirna!” opposite Ištar (SAA 20 no. 15 i 1′‒5′). Subsequently the king goes to a spring close to the akītu-house and performs offerings of sheep and blood before throwing a fish and a crab into the spring and pouring oil, honey, and wine into it. He then appears before the public swinging a purification device (SAA 20 no. 15 i 1′‒13′). Only the reference to the spring corresponds to a section in a cultic commentary – SAA 3 no. 37: 3′‒4′ – that in fact refers to a well rather than a spring and compares the king’s action with “[Marduk] who cast a spell against Enlil in the Abyss (Apsû), and consi[gned him] to the Anunnaki.” The king’s visit to the spring is followed by a visit to the akītu-house, where he offers salt and sheep before the gods of heaven and then returns to the palace. Subsequently, the king once again visits the akītuhouse and provides cooked meat. After a broken passage, ritual performance resumes with further offerings of sheep and cooked meat. Additionally, the king burns a female goat kid before the gods (SAA 20 no. 15 i 46′), a ritual gesture that, as mentioned above, is encoded with the mythic meaning of killing the sons of Enlil and Ea. Creative engagement with mythic knowledge is further apparent in the interpretation of the ensuing rite, the ‘opening of the vat,’ as Marduk defeating Tiāmat with his penis (SAA 3 no. 37: 18′). As Simo Parpola demonstrates, the penis is to be equated with the bow (qaštu) as the weapon of Ištar:
In Enūma eliš, Marduk fashions a bow, designates it as his weapon (IV 35), and defeats Tiāmat with it (IV 101); later Anu lifts it up, kisses it, calls it ‘my daughter’, and fixes it as a constellation in the sky (VI 82‒92). The constellation in question, ‘Bow Star’ (mul.ban), our Canis Maior, rose in Ab (August), a hot month with death and netherworld connotations (see Abusch, JNES 33, [10974] 260 f), and its equation with Ištar in her destructive aspect is well attested (e.g., “Ab, the month of the Bow Star, the heroic daughter of Sin,’ Streck Asb. pp. 72 ix 9 f and 198 iii 1; ‘Bow Star = Ištar Elammatu, the daughter of
162 It seems that this pectoral has to be distinguished from the “stones” (na4.meš), which are listed among the insignia of the king in a purification ritual (discussed in Chapter 9.7) and treated in detail by Schuster-Brandis 2008, 162 ff.



The Akı̄tu-festival in Aššur 425
Anu,’ Mul Apin I ii 7 and KAV 218 B I 17). Consequently, the weapon by which Marduk defeats Tiāmat actually is Ištar, and the fact that in the mystical text SAA 3 37:18 Marduk defeats Tiāmat with his ‘penis’ (ušaru) proves the existence of the bow = penis association in contemporary mysticism.163
The king continues with the last rite performed over the defeated animal, which stands in for the subdued enemy. After performing further libations and showing himself to the public, the king pours a libation of water, beer, wine, milk, and blood upon the heads of the animals; he then sprinkles flour and swings the purification device, places a head before the gods, and libates again before stepping on a pedestal and being given something to eat (SAA 20 no. 15 ii 10′‒19′). The head in this case probably represents the head of the monster referred to in the ritual text, so that the ritual of libation over the head itself represents the concluding cultic act familiar from Assyrian reliefs of the lion hunt and from battle scenes like those of Shalmaneser III’s (858‒824 BCE) Black Obelisk, which signal the reestablishment of cosmic order to the gods.164 The text is very fragmentary at this point, but it appears that the king finishes the libations of the vat. While the king stands on the pedestal a singer intones “To (Ištar)-Amurrītu,” which, according to the commentary, associates the king with “Marduk [who] with his bow in his hand cast down Ea, while Venus was ascendant in front of him” (SAA 3 no. 37: 20′‒22′). The ensuing sections on the reverse of the tablet pertain to the tākultu-ritual. As is clear from the above discussion, various mythic stratagems inform ritual performance and its exegesis in the cultic commentaries. It is only possible to penetrate the meaning of Assyrian state rituals with a multi-layered perspective that draws from all the extant mythic narratives dealing with the battle against chaos and cultic commentaries. On the basis of cultic commentary SAA 3 no. 37, the following ritual gestures can be understood as signaling various steps in the process of defeating the forces of chaos and securing the rank of rulership:
a. Wearing jewelry = Marduk wearing his armor (SAA 3 37 16′), b. Burning/roasting a female = Burning the sons of Enlil and Ea in fire goat kid (SAA 3 37 17′) c. Opening the vat in the race = Marduk defeating Tiāmat with his penis (SAA 3 37: 18′) d. The king standing on a = Marduk casting down Ea with his bow pedestal with a heart in his (SAA 3 37:22′) hand
163 Parpola 1997, XCI fn. 114. 164 Compare Aššurnaṣirpal II’s libation over either the dead bull or lion as represented in his palace in Calah with Shalmaneser III’s libation over Jehu of Jerusalem.

e. The tossing of the cake = Crushing Anu (SAA 3 37:19′) or heart of Ea, when he pulled it out and [...] it with his hands (SAA 3 37:23′) f. [The chariots] which they = Nabû who is sent against Enlil and defeats dispatch and the ‘third man’ him (SAA 3 37:24′ff.) who places the whip in the king’s hand ...
The interconnectedness between myth and ritual discussed above transcends Edmund Leach’s dictum that “myth implies ritual, ritual implies myth, they are one and the same,”165 a premise adopted by the Assyriologist Alasdair Livingstone.166 It also transcends the relationship between myth and ritual originally outlined by representatives of the Myth and Ritual school,167 since my emphasis is on the notion of myth as plotline and on the process of mythologization versus myth as a closed narrative, which allows ritual to be flexible in its adaptation of mythic traditions. As is evident in this chapter, the most important state rituals revolved around the “political” myth centered on the warrior god Ninurta. These rituals annually cemented the institution of kingship in society and the incumbent king’s occupation of his office. The paradigm of the combat myth formed the core of the ancient political belief system and served to explain and justify royal action, but at some point the paradigm of theomachy – including parricide and the notion of a generational change of leadership – was incorporated into the prevailing political ideology. Sennacherib’s murder might account for this, as it probably engendered ritualized comment and explanation in order to harmonize it with the cosmic order. In myth, changes at the top of the pantheon took place when Marduk relegated his father to the Apsû and replaced Enlil in supreme leadership. State rituals and commentaries reveal that in their adoption of Babylonian and Hurrian tradition (see the Kumarbi Cycle), Assyrians deemed it important to include the notion of parricide in their state rituals as a potential component in the king’s rise to power, reenacting it on an annual basis. Although the murder of Sennacherib may have prompted a reworking of ritual performance, it is also interesting to note that already in the Assyrian coronation ritual the deposed gods (ilū darsūte) in the Aššur temple are listed among the divinities to whom the future king offers stones as gifts (SAA 20 no. 7 ii 4), evoking the notion of generational change as a model.

The Neo-Assyrian Ištar Rituals 427
10.6 The Neo-Assyrian Ištar Rituals
Several of the ritual gestures signaling parricide, theomachy, or the combat myth feature in rituals centered on the goddess Ištar, who, as already stated, played an essential role in mediating between the Assyrian ruler and the god Aššur (SAA 20 no. 16 i 1′‒4′ and rev. iv 8‒34; no. 17 I 7‒8; no. 19). The Ištar ritual SAA 20 no. 19 is particularly well suited for elucidating how the reception of Sumero-Babylonian and Hurrian cultural discourse in Assyria shaped Assyrian royal ideological discourse. Given the available evidence, the precise implications of this reception are difficult to determine; several points can nevertheless be made. The Ištar ritual SAA 20 no. 19 took place either in the Aššur temple or in the Ištar temple, and the first offering was made to Aššur by the king after he brought Ištar into the temple. The divine participants who receive offerings are Aššur, Ištar, the Sebetti, probably Kulitta,168 and Lisikutu, though offerings are repeatedly presented to Aššur and Ištar. Human participants in the ritual include the king, the singer, the šangû-priest, and the magnates. The section describing the active involvement of the magnates is broken, but the extant text refers to the singer, who intones: “My feast, my feast is battle,” establishing an intertextual link with the Assyrian war ritual which includes Ištar in her hypostasis as Bēlat-dunāni.169 Subsequently, part of the ritual takes place in the bedroom, where the ṣīpu dish is offered before Ištar and libations are made; after he performs purification rites with incense, the king offers blood into the pit (apu) and pours syrup and oil as well as beer and wine into it.170 When cuts of roast meat arrive, the king pierces the front part of the neck cut with an iron dagger and feeds it to Lisikutu. The singer intones, “Let them eat roast, roast, roast meat.” When the song reaches its end, the king casts the neck cut into the pit. Further purification rites involving the censer follow, after which the king opens the vat and completes the libations of the vat, the singer intones a festive Hurrah, and the king and the magnates wield clappers. As soon as the king finishes his part of the meal, the singer performs his offices and the šangû performs battle. The francolin (= bird of Kakka = messenger of Anu) is then brought out and the priest gives water to Ištar and the king; still more purification rites and libations follow and the king feeds the foreleg to Lisikutu. The singer intones: “Who opens the house

of silver?” and then the king throws the foreleg into the pit and pours syrup, oil, beer, and wine upon it. Finally, the singer fills up the pit and the king places his foot upon it before leaving for the palace. Two elements in this ritual are conspicuously alien to the Assyro-Babylonian tradition, namely the pit (apu) at which the purification rites are performed and the use of blood as part of the purification process. Interestingly, pits are well-known in Anatolian rituals and blood serves as a typical means of purification in Hurrian rituals.171 Other elements requiring explanation are the allusions to the bed of Ištar, which implicitly refer to a sexual relationship between Ištar and the king, and the involvement of the magnates. Once again the commentary SAA 3 no. 37 provides an exegetical explanation:
9′ [The brazie]r which is lighted in front of Mullissu, and the sheep which they throw on the brazier and which the fire burns, is Qingu, when he burns in the fire. (combat myth) 10′‒15′ The torches, which he lights from the brazier, are merciless arrows from the quiver of Marduk, which are terrible in their shooting off and which, when they hit, slay (even) the strong; drenched in blood and gore, they rain down mountains and lands. The gods, his fathers and brothers, and the evil gods, Anzû and Asakku, were vanquished by them. (theomachy and combat myth combined) 16′‒17′ The king, who wears his jewelry and roasts young virgin goats, is Marduk, who wearing his armor bur[ned] the sons of Enlil and Ea in fire. (theomachy) 18′ [The ki]ng, who opens the vat in the race, is Marduk, who [defeat]ed Tiāmat with his penis. (combat myth) 19 [The ki]ng, who with the high priest tosses the cake, is Marduk (with) Nabû, [who ...] vanquished and crushed Anu (theomachy) 20 The king, who stands on the podium with a [heart] in his hand, while the singer chants ‘To the Western Goddess’, is Marduk, [who] with his bow in his hand cast down Ea, while Venus was ascendant in front of him.
How can Ištar’s prominence in the ritual, which evokes battle scenes and which involves the performance of rites in Ištar’s bedroom, be explained? Although she is characterized as mistress of battle, with the exception of the first millennium cultic commentaries Ištar’s involvement in theomachy is attested only once Sumero-Babylonian tradition of the Old Babylonian period and can probably therefore not be traced back to the influence of Babylonian scholars in Assyria. Consequently, it is necessary to search for parallels in other cultural horizons, and it is here that Hurrian tradition again provides a possible solution since Ištar is one of the key protagonists in the Hurrian Song of Hedammu.

The Neo-Assyrian Ištar Rituals 429
This song forms part of a cycle of myths centered on Kumarbi, who represents the older generation of gods and whose position as king of the gods is threatened by the younger Teššub.172 The entire cycle of Kumarbi songs is addressed to the Primeval Deities, an epithet that is sometimes translated as the ‘Former Gods.’173 This corresponds well with the associations of the dromena and legomena performed in our NeoAssyrian ritual, which – as indicated by the cultic commentaries – implicitly reference the fathers and brothers among the opponents of the younger god Marduk. The Defeated Gods in the Old Syrian and Hurrian tradition include Anu, Antu, Enlil, Ninlil, Nara-Napsara, Minki, and Ammunki;174 Anu and Enlil also figure as defeated gods in the Mesopotamian cultural horizon. While the notion of the Defeated or Bound Gods is very old and extends back to Sumerian mythology, it generally includes only rebel gods.175 Only one Sumerian myth of the Old Babylonian period, known as Enlil and Namzitarra, has a vague reference to Enlil usurping kingship from Enmešarra. The relevant lines read as follows:
17 u4 den-me-šár-ra šeš ad-da-zu lúxkár-da-a 18 nam-den-líl ba-e-de6-a ud-de3-en-gin7 nam /ga\-zu-e-še
17 When Enmešarra, your father’s brother was captured, 18 You carried off kingship saying, ‘As of this day I shall assign destinies.’176
Bilingual versions of this myth have been found in Emar and Ugarit,177 testifying to the possibility of transmission of the trope of theomachy to the north. Another possibility is that theomachy entered Assyrian cultural discourse by way of Hurrian tradition, as the theme of theomachy is central to several tales belonging to the Kumarbi Cycle. Theomachy is apparent in the Assyrian cultic commentaries discussed above and then only reappears in detailed narrative form in mythic tales like Enmešarra’s Defeat and The Defeat of Enutila, Enmešarra, and Qingu, which all date to the Late Babylonian period and seem to revive the Old Babylonian tradition revolving around Enmešarra rather than Anu, Enlil, and Ea as older members of the pantheon.178 The above attempt to

locate the ways through which various strands of assorted traditions made their way into Assyrian cultural discourse is indicative of the artificiality and fruitlessness of attempting to identify origins when evidence is as scarce as it is in this case. What is relevant here, however, is that the Assyrian scholars in their capacity as agents behind the scene – participated in a shared cultural discourse, which was centered on the organization of power and on kingship, and which seems to have been much more prominent in Northern Mesopotamia and Anatolia as revealed by its pervasive presence either in mythic narrative or in ritual. Further, the marked presence of parricide and usurpation in this cultural discourse points to broad similarities in the weltanschauung of scholars from different regions, including Assyria and the Hurrian-Hittite milieu.179 While the trope might have originated in Babylonia, it is its elaborate treatment in Hurrian-Hittite mythology on the one hand and in Assyrian ritual on the other which to my view links both cultures in their discourse. Yet another feature suggestive of a shared Hurrian and Assyrian mythic tradition is the reference made to the bed of Ištar, implying some kind of sexual performance on her part. Although the trope of the Sacred Marriage180 might appear to be an obvious explanation, it belongs to the Sumero-Babylonian tradition of the late third to early second millennium BCE and references the close bond between the Sumerian goddess Inanna and the king. This tradition has no real counterpart in Assyria. Instead, Ištar’s close relationship with the Assyrian king was based in her role as wet nurse and nurse to the Assyrian crown prince and in her function as the voice of Aššur in oracles delivered to the king. Accordingly, a different trope is likely to underpin Ištar’s sexual role in the Neo-Assyrian Ištar rituals. The Hurrian Song of Hedammu again comes to mind, as it is Ištar-Šauška who develops the plan to defeat the sea-monster Hedammu – created by Kumarbi in his effort to gain rulership – by means of her seductive charm. In order to seduce Hedammu, Ištar bathes and anoints herself before walking to the shore in the company of her two maidservants, Ninatta and Kulitta. Ištar exposes her naked body to Hedammu and, though the relevant passage is not preserved, succeeds in or helps in killing Hedammu, the opponent of the younger god Teššub. Last but not least the song “Who opens the house of silver” in the Assyrian state ritual evokes the Hurrian-Hittite Song of Silver, which is also part of the Kumarbi Cycle. Here the personified Silver aligns himself with Kumarbi as a member of the older generation of gods against the storm-god and Ištar-Šauška, who represent the younger generation. While there is no reason to believe that

The Neo-Assyrian Ištar Rituals 431
Fig. 57: King in Ištar’s bīt nathi (after Sollberger 1974, 238, fig. 1).
the Neo-Assyrian ritual from Aššur represents the reenactment of a Hurrian myth, the evidence does suggest that Hurrians and Assyrians possibly shared a mythical tradition that accounts for Ištar’s association with the trope of the Defeated Gods, an association otherwise alien to Sumero-Babylonian religion. This Hurrian connection is perhaps confirmed by the use of the term bīt nathi ‘bedchamber’ in Aššurnaṣirpal I’s (1046‒1033 BCE) epigraph on the White Obelisk. The term refers to Ištar’s bedchamber in her temple in Nineveh and is a Hurrian loanword that made its way into the Hittite language and was adopted in Assyria.181 In the Sargonid period the term bīt nathi is superseded by the standard bīt majāli, but the image on the White Obelisk representing the king in the bīt nathi in front of Ištar (fig. 57) and the term itself possibly refer to the same or at least to similar ritual events. There are further indications of shared Assyrian and Hurrian cultic traditions. According to the Nuzi texts, the cultic bīt ēqi building has an equivalent in the city Ulamme, where it is associated with Bēl-Ulamme.182 One of the NeoAssyrian rituals (SAA 20 16) takes place in the bīt ēqi of Aššur and involves an offering before the standard (duri.gal) that accompanied the king on his military campaigns. The ritual prescriptions involve references to the jewelry worn by the king, the priest’s placement of two Anzû-birds between his (the king’s?)

shoulders, litanies recited before Ištar of the bīt ēqi, the “dancing” of the kamānu-cakes signifying the demotion of Anu and Enlil, and the opening of the vat evoking Marduk’s defeat of Tiāmat. These actions have strong belligerent overtones and, like the ritual discussed above, demonstrate Ištar’s involvement in the defeat of chaos.
10.7 The Intermediality of Myth, Ritual, and Cultic Commentaries
Rites associated with combat myths do not appear in the rituals dating to the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I (SAA 20 nos. 24‒27), but are attested repeatedly in various Sargonid period rituals. This suggests that the ritualization of the Ninurta mythology and by extension the Marduk mythology as represented by Enūma eliš and the king’s integration in it developed only during the first millennium BCE, possibly only toward the end of the history of the Assyrian empire, subsequent to Sennacherib’s appropriation of the myth and of the akītu-festival as celebrated in Babylon. Both the producers of the rituals (the scholars) and the ritual participants (the king in particular) associated rituals with particular meanings reflecting a specifically Assyrian perspective. The analysis of ritual cycle of the months of Šabaṭu, Addaru and Nisannu and of the Ištar ritual has revealed that while movement between sacred places is involved, often even in company of deities, ritual performance predominantly focuses on the king and his cosmic role as conqueror of chaos thus assimilating the role played by Marduk in the Babylonian akītu-festival or by Ninurta as told in myth. Rather than performing a cultic drama in the Greek style, however, these ritual gestures, as highlighted by the cultic commentaries, symbolically signaled the very moment of defeat or killing and the defeat of the elder generation of gods. Combat myth and parricide were not reenacted in a narrative way. The Assyrian ritual is neither “combat drama,” nor “seasonal drama,” nor “sacred marriage ritual” as suggested by former ancient Near Eastern scholarship183 in the wake of Sir James Frazer’s The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion, 1890. It did not reenact Aššur’s combat against Tiāmat as depicted on Sennacherib’s gate of the akītu-house; rather this role was emulated by the Assyrian king who by his ritual performance evoked a complexity of various strands of tradition relating to combat myth and parricide pinpointing the very outcome of mythic narratives.

The Intermediality of Myth, Ritual, and Cultic Commentaries 433
The performance of state rituals in Assyria went far beyond the establishment of communion with the gods or among the social circle of scholars, priests, and the king by means of the consumption of a shared meal. In Assyrian state rituals, ritual performance focuses on presencing the divine through engagement with the mythic traditions of the combat myth and theomachy while circumscribing the king’s role as a member of the divine circle who is actively engaged in securing the cosmic order through the temporary assumption of the role of the warrior god Marduk or Ninurta. It is in the Sargonid context that this intermediality184 between myth and ritual was most highly developed, reenacting not one particular myth, but weaving various mythic strands and stratagems into a ritual performance that circumscribed the royal scope of action as preformed in its actual historical dimensions. In other words, the mythic stratagems that found expression in ritual performance were informed by and in turn functioned as the model for royal action. As discussed in earlier sections of this book, this intermediality of myth, ritual, and image is apparent in common themes and motifs on the one hand and in divergent or modified emphases and forms of expression on the other. Intermediality of this kind does not only presuppose profound knowledge of mythic narratives on the part of both ritual producers and ritual participants, but also technical precision in ritual performance, the success of which depended on the education and deep cultural knowledge of its participants. Moreover, by evoking entire narratives in their outcome through particular ritual gestures, intermediality served to increase the efficacy and communicability of ritual performance and to suspend the limits of time and space.185 It is precisely this deep engagement with cultural discourse in its multimediality that must have resulted in the production of the cultic commentaries. Critically, cultic commentaries not only elucidate the function and meaning of Assyrian state rituals, but also provide the modern scholar with an insight into the ancients’ conception of mythic narratives in general. The ancients conceived of their mythic narratives as explanatory models that were defined by a particular emplotment and served as a paradigm for historical as well as cultic constellations the king was engaged in. In ritual these narratives in their iconic outcome were enacted by a particu
184 The concept of “intermediality” developed from the concept of intertextuality in media studies in order to describe the interrelatedness or fusion of various media such as text, theater, dance, music, and film in one work of art and to express the idea that all media exist in relation to other media (Schröter 2010). Intermediality can involve transposition, combination, or references creating an “as if” quality by evoking one medium in another medium (Rajewsky 2005). 185 On intermediality see Paech and Schröter 2008; May 2012.



434 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
lar set of actors representing specific social types that interacted in predetermined constellations, thereby allowing both human (the king) and divine actors to perform the same roles. Over several millennia, the combat myth was rewritten with the same plot and the same configuration of types of actors performing the same functions, namely battling disruptive forces in order to guarantee the functioning of the cosmic and civic order: names and details could vary, but the narrative structure always remained essentially the same. Consequently, local particularities are only evident in the choice of specific mythic actors like Ninurta, Tišpak, Marduk, and Aššur, all of whom took on the role of hero or warrior-god in the battle against the forces of chaos. In all cases their opponent, regardless of individual form or name, whether identified as Anzû, Asakku, Labbu, or Qingu and Tiāmat, sought to usurp or overturn the divinely established order and, more concretely, the legitimate line of succession. However, the particular individual agents – warrior god and his opponent with their characteristic traits were inserted into the original narrative in particular historical settings. It is in these historical settings that “innovations, modifications, omissions, and fine recalibrations” were introduced into the “widely known and commonly accepted version” of the mythic narrative.186 In their historical settings, particular iterations of mythic narratives functioned as literary devices that justified the ascent of a certain god to the status of patron deity or to the position of supreme god. When these local iterations became part of the cultural metadiscourse formulated in the cultic commentaries, the “historical” agents were no longer important, variation was minimized, and the emphasis was placed on the general plotline of the combat myth. Moreover, the king assumed the role of the warrior god in Assyrian state rituals. The cultic commentaries’ focus on the commonalities of ancient combat myths as represented by their shared plotline and types of actors allowed them to engage creatively and imaginatively with the names of particular protagonists, enabling a continuous rewriting of narrative tradition without altering the essential paradigm of the combat myth. Adherence to the combat myth paradigm informing myth, ritual, image, and historiographical discourse demonstrates its truth status and sheds light on the assumptions about society, normative values, and principles of action with which it was imbued by the ancients. This, in turn, explains the persuasiveness and longevity of the combat myth in ancient Near Eastern ideologies and in Assyrian ideology in particular.187

The Assyrian Coronation Ritual 435
10.8 The Assyrian Coronation Ritual
In Mesopotamia generally and in Assyria in particular, the mythic concept of kingship originating in heaven, as related in the Sumerian King List and other narratives of power, was integral to the ritual performance of the coronation ritual. This ritual was often not performed in the capital; in cases where the religious center and the political capital were not one and the same, the ceremony invariably took place in the religious center, which in Assyria was Aššur. This choice can be explained by the fact that the coronation ritual’s objective through which the king took symbolic possession of the powers of his office was to connect the individual royal person with the divine world and thus to reassert the link between the king as body politic and the gods. By virtue of its performance in the religious center, i.e. Aššur, the coronation ritual served to concretize and materialize the cosmological notion of kingship and, concomitantly, to affirm the intertwinement of the institutions of the palace and the temple of the supreme god Aššur. The coronation ceremonial, consequently, stressed the connection between the symbolic function of the individual king and his relationship with the active center of social and cosmic order represented by the seat of the chief god and the home of the leading religious elites.188 The performance of the coronation ritual defined the king’s cosmic identity and authoritatively imposed on him his obligation to act by the command of and in compliance with the gods. As part of his heroic destiny, the king was obliged to work toward the conquest and subjugation of the known universe, which was ultimately considered the domain of the gods. At least within Assyrian culture, the cosmic role of the king as divine warrior explains why his military and priestly duties were so closely intertwined. As is done by Maurice Bloch, the theological superstructure of the coronation ritual can be interpreted as a means of legitimating traditional authority.189 Beyond its legitimating function, however, the Middle Assyrian Coronation Ritual also outlined and defined the king’s scope of action and shaped and affirmed the particular socio-political organization of the higher echelons of the Assyrian administrative apparatus. Moreover, the royal commemorative inscriptions reveal that the ritual never lost its semantic components. Throughout Assyrian history kings perpetually strove to affirm that they had met the requirements of their office and, consequently, that they corresponded to the image of the ideal king.
188 The Mesopotamian model is thus more complex than the case discussed by Geertz 1977, 151. 189 Bloch 1989.



436 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
Given the cosmic and social importance assigned to kingship in the ancient Near Eastern Weltanschauung, it is surprising how little evidence survives that can be directly associated with the coronation ritual. There are, however, a few texts attested from the second through the first millennium BCE that list the regalia of the royal office and the host of competences transferred to the king by the gods in order to enable him to successfully fulfill the duties associated with his office; these texts shed much light on the social definition and identity190 of kingship in Mesopotamia and on the cultural meaning of the coronation ritual in particular. In contrast to Early Dynastic Ebla in Syria, where a ritual for a marriage and coronation ceremony survives,191 the ritual investiture of the king is not attested in Old Sumerian texts. For the Ur III period and Isin I period, information about the coronation of the king can only be found in administrative texts and literary texts such as royal hymns. Administrative texts from the period of Ibbi-Suen record offerings in Nippur, the seat of the supreme god Enlil, on the occasion of the king’s reception of the brimmed cap (aga3), the most important signifier of rulership. In addition to Enlil in Nippur, the new ruler had to pay homage to Inanna in Uruk, Nanna in Ur, and Ninhursag in Nutur.192 The royal hymns of the Ur III kings convey the same message: the coronation of the new king took place in Nippur and not in Ur, their royal residence. Following the king’s blessing by Enlil, he travelled to other southern cultic centers, among them Uruk and Ur, in order to receive the blessings of the respective city gods. It should be noted in this regard that in the Ur III hymns the investiture of the king was sometimes connected to his military achievements. Akin to the emplotment of Old Babylonian and later myths, Ur III royal hymns present the act of subduing of the enemy as a prerequisite for the king’s promotion. Šulgi’s journey to Nippur with the booty collected on his military campaigns very much resembles Ningirsu’s triumphal entry into Ekur in order to present his trophies to Enlil and secure the establishment of his cult:
He [=Šulgi] moored the boat at the temple area of Nibru, the temple area Dur-an-ki, at Enlil’s Kar-geština. He entered before Enlil with the silver and lapis lazuli of the foreign lands loaded into leather pouches and leather bags, all their heaped-up treasures, and with the amassed wealth of the foreign lands.193

The Assyrian Coronation Ritual 437
Enlil in turn decrees a good destiny for Šulgi, guaranteeing him a long-lasting and successful reign, whereupon the king travels to the major cultic centers of Sumer to receive the blessings of their patron deities. An Old Babylonian bilingual text from the reign of Hammurabi inscribed on a stone statue reveals that the Babylonian mandate for rulership also consisted essentially of winning battles in order to maintain the cosmic and social order originally established by the gods. In all periods, the gods are said to bestow the regalia and typical royal characteristics of leadership upon kings primarily to enable them to succeed in this regard. Although the Old Babylonian text has traditionally been classified as a hymn, Wassermann recently categorized it as a secondary textualization of “oracular messages by several gods to Hammurabi, calling him not to wait any longer but to dare and move against his adversaries.”194
“Enlil gave you a heroic destiny as for you, for whom do you wait? “Sîn gave you leadership as for you, for whom do you wait? “Ninurta gave you an exalted weapon as for you, for whom do you wait? “Inanna gave you battle and strife as for you, for whom do you wait? “Šamaš and Adad are watching over you as for you, for whom do you wait? (gap)
“ ... gain the victory, make yourself a hero In the four world regions, That your name be invoked forever. “May the numerous peoples be prayerful and supplicant to you, “May they recount of you great (poems) of praise! “May they sound of you exalted adulation! (gap)
He showed forth his great power to the distant future, Hammurabi, the great warrior king, Who struck down his enemies, a deluge in warfare, Who leveled the land of the foe, who extinguished warfare, Who suppressed insurrections, who destroyed opponents, Like figurines of clay, Who found the way out of numerous difficult crises, (breaks off)195

438 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
It is only from the Middle Assyrian period onward that there is concrete evidence for the transmission of the ritual prescription for the coronation ceremony. The Middle Assyrian coronation ritual is complemented by a coronation ritual from the late Sargonid period (seventh century BCE)196 that for the most part records only the hymns to be recited during the ritual. The beginning of the Middle Assyrian coronation ritual text does not survive, but the remainder of the text suggests that while the magnates and eunuchs perform a particular rite in the Aššur temple, a procession including the king sets out from the palace (mentioned in SAA 20 no. 7 I 33′) – in this case probably the Old Palace – and proceeds through the Anzû Gate toward the Aššur temple, in this text referred to as the ‘House of God’:
SAA 20 7 I 22′‒30′
[Having finished] their blessings, [the magnates and the royal eunuchs] place [......] before Aššur [...]. The king [......]. touches the king [......] ... The carrier[s pla]ce [the throne of the king upon their necks] and s[et off] for the House of God (=Aššur temple). They enter the [House] of God. The priest of Aššur slaps [the king’s face] in their presence and says thus: “Aššur is king! Aššur is king!” He says so [as far as] the Anzû Gate. [Having r]eached the Anzû Gate, the king [en]ters the House of God.
Given the general conception in modern scholarship of the Assyrian king as a despot, the participation of the magnates and royal eunuchs in the ritual performance and their role in confirming the king in his office is notable, as they are assigned at least a symbolic part in his enthronement. During his coronation, the Assyrian king endured humiliation by being slapped in the face by the šangû, which is comparable to the king’s humiliation in the Babylonian akītu-festival.197 This humiliation was not so much a temporary degradation in status as in the Babylonian case, but was intended to stress the Assyrian king’s inferior status vis-à-vis Aššur, i.e. his stewardship, with kingship being reserved for the supreme god. Once in the temple, the Assyrian king presents numerous stones to a variety of deities.198 The long lists of stones presented as offerings to the gods are peculiar to this ritual and are not attested elsewhere in Assyrian rituals on a
196 Livingstone, SAA 3 no. 11. For the text see Chapter 5.4. 197 See most recently Pongratz-Leisten 2014a. 198 Annus 2002, 162 suggests that this offering is reminiscent of the section in Lugal-e in which Ninurta judges the stones, variously cursing and blessing them while assigning either good or bad properties to them. The cursing and blessing scene is modeled after judgment in court, and the stones are evaluated according to their behavior in the battle against Ninurta. For the stones see also Postgate 1997.



The Assyrian Coronation Ritual 439
comparable scale.199 Following the offering of stones, the Middle Assyrian ritual continues with prescriptions regarding the crown of Aššur and the weapons of Ištar-Mullissu as well as the king’s headgear (kulūlu). Subsequently, while the šangû-priest places the royal headdress on the head of the future king, the magnates and royal eunuchs recite the following blessing:
SAA 20 7 30 ff.
“May Aššur and [M]ullissu, the owners of your crown, co[v]er you with your crown for a hundred years! May your foot be good in the temple and your hands be good [a]t the chest of Aššur, your God! May your priest[hood] and that of your sons be pleasing to Aššur. Expand your country with your just scepter! Expand your country with your just scepter! May Aššur give you command (qabâ), understanding (šemâ),200 obedience (magīra), justice (kitta)201 and peace (salīma)!”
By combining the cultic and political actions of the king, this blessing provides a religious foundation for royal action in general. After blessing the king, the magnates and courtiers pay homage to him and kiss his feet. The king leaves the Aššur temple through the courtyard of Nunnamnir and returns to the palace. Once they have performed a ritual on the rēš hameluhhi, which is part of the palace, the cultic specialists carry the king first to the terrace (tamlû), which was built at the latest under Tukultī-Ninurta I,202 and then to the bīt labbūni located in the northeastern annex and dating to the Middle Assyrian period, where they place him on the royal throne. Again the magnates and courtiers pay homage to the king, while he remains seated on the throne. The courtiers then present gifts to the king, of which the first is taken to the Aššur temple and placed before Aššur as the revenue of the šangû. Another key moment in the ritual takes place at this point, involving the reinstatement under the new king of those who are part of the Assyrian state apparatus. The grand vizier, the second vizier, and other officials and cultic personnel divest themselves of the insignia of their office and present themselves to the king as individuals bereft of their previous positions. The king then addresses them with the words, “Everybody may keep his office!” After paying homage yet again, the officials return to their hierarchically determined places. A list of stones offered to various gods follows.
199 See SAA 20 no. 7 II 4 for a similar kind of offering. 200 Parpola, SAA 20 no. 7 35 has “attention.” 201 Parpola, SAA 20 no. 7 36 has “truth.” 202 Miglus 1986, 201.



440 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
The subscript of the tablet states that its prescribed offerings were to enter the temples of the gods of Kār Tukultī-Ninurta; additionally, the tablet states that the gods of Kār Tukultī-Ninurta dwell in Aššur, thus indicating that the text must have been written after the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I, when his new capital had been abandoned and its gods had been returned to Aššur. Following a ruling, the text continues to list offerings for gods. All three blessings or speech acts performed by the king or the magnates and eunuchs establish and reinforce the reality of the Assyrian organization of power by means of their perlocutionary force. The first blessing acclaims the kingship of the god Aššur and implicitly establishes the inferior status of the Assyrian ruler as his steward. The second blessing acclaims the king in his role as the chief šangû of Aššur, which, as stated earlier in this book, includes the king’s role as a warrior who is divinely commanded to expand the borders of Assyria, thus introducing a cosmological concept of war preceding the creation of order. As is the case in the rhetoric of the Assyrian royal inscriptions, the internal logic of this cosmological concept is that only by means of war and the defeat of the enemy can the king achieve peace and justice. This is also why Aššur is entreated to bestow eloquence, understanding, obedience, justice, and peace on the king only after the king is instructed to expand Assyria’s borders. The third speech act was performed by the king himself, who reinstated the magnates and eunuchs in their offices, thereby making clear their dependence on the institution of kingship and their inferior status in relationship to it. No other text expresses so clearly how the Assyrian state hierarchy and power structure were ideally conceived: 1) the god Aššur, 2) the king as steward and šangû of Aššur, 3) the courtiers, and 4) other officials. Indeed, establishing this hierarchical organization appears to have been the central concern of the coronation ritual. The transformational quality of the coronation ritual’s performance is implicit in the annalistic texts of Adad-nīrārī II (911‒891 BCE), which include a beautiful example of the idea that high rank and status is intrinsically linked with perfection in outer appearance – a concept that, as we have seen, is also integral to the Gilgamesh Epic.203 Only the perfect royal body can be turned into a body politic and be entrusted with kingship by the gods:
The great gods, who take firm decisions, who decree destinies, they properly created me, Adad-nārārī (II), attentive prince, [...], they altered my stature to lordly stature (nabnīti bēlūti), they rightly made perfect my features (šikin bunnannīya) and filled my lordly body (zumur bēlūtīya) with wisdom. After the great gods had decreed (my destiny, after) they

The various text categories that have appeared in the preceding discussion hymn, ritual, and royal inscription – demonstrate that we should not subscribe to the categorical divide between ritual as practice and discourse as represented in the theological superstructure. While authorizing social structures and hierarchies, ritual must evoke the cosmological discourse in order to map the institution of kingship onto the larger cosmic scheme, which brings us back to Gumbrechts’ concept of “presencing.”205 The affective force of the coronation ritual consisted in re-doing the hierarchical relationships in a formalized way (dromena) and substantiating them through the verbal specification of this act (legomena) in order to physically and mentally shape and materialize the organization of power between temple and palace and between god, king, courtiers, and officials in the Assyrian state. The Assyrian coronation ritual includes ritualized elaborations of functional movements like moving between palace and temple, various prostrations performed by the king in front of the god and by the magnates and officials in front of the king, slapping the king’s cheek, and moving the insignia of kingship. All of these acts contributed to the bodily, physical experience of the intended hierarchy of power and enhanced its experience and communication.206
10.9 Sacralizing the Regalia of Kingship
Exercising authority involves and depends upon the use of nonverbal instruments and media,207 among them the regalia of kingship. Insignia such as the scepter, weapon, crown, and throne function as signifiers of the royal office and distinguish the king’s status from that of the rest of the population. As “iconic emblems,” they announce the authority of their bearer to a given audience and within a circumscribed context or sphere of activity.208 Incantations dedicated to the royal insignia dating to the Neo-Assyrian period reveal that

they were considered to be of divine origin, created by divine craftsmen like Ninildu (the carpenter of Anu), Ninagal (the goldsmith of Anu),209 and Kusu (chief šangû of Enlil).210 Divine craftsmanship of this kind was understood to imbue the king’s regalia with divine agency, which guaranteed the functioning of the cosmic order. Consequently, the king’s regalia not only announced his authority but effectuated the success of his performance in office. In this light, the presentation of the insignia to the king during the coronation ritual was thus a prerequisite for his successful rulership, and their destiny to serve the king had been determined by the gods.211 As is discussed in Chapter Five, these iconic emblems were listed among the me and were often used as synecdoches for rulership212 in text and image. In the ancient Weltanschauung, they not only represented kingship but could act as secondary agents213 of the king or the office of kingship, divine and human. In ritual performance, the king’s attire or garment could serve as a representation of the king’s presence, which is attested in the celebration of the Assyrian akītu-festival in the imperial periphery; in the festive cycle in the city of Aššur the king wore Aššur’s tiara to signal the god’s and the king’s uncontested kingship. In his discussion of deified emblems and paraphernalia, which are listed in the early god lists from Fara and Abu Ṣalabīḥ, Gebhard Selz observed that items like “the Crown,” the “Headband” or “Turban,” the “Princely Ring(?),” “the Staff (of) the Leader,” and the “Nose Rope,” “were actually thought to contain the respective powers of the respective office.”214 Although Selz is certainly correct in emphasizing that “these objects were not mere ‘attributes,’” but “were thought to contain ‘ideas’ materially”215 that linked the concept of rulership to the ‘office’ rather than to the person holding that office, I stress the agency of these objects in the experience of the human mind for precisely this reason.216
209 In the ritual for the reconstruction of a temple from Uruk it is Guškinbanda who functions as the divine goldsmith, Thureau-Dangin 1921, 46‒47. 210 See the incantations addressed to the royal throne (K 4906 + 1‒5 and K9276+ rev. 4, Berlejung 1996, 21 f.), the royal weapon (K 4906+ 58‒85 and K 9276+ rev. 6, Berlejung 1996, 26‒27), and the royal bow (K 4906+ 134‒172+, Berlejung 1996, 28‒29). 211 Berlejung 1996, 32. 212 See Chapter 5.1.
213 While Selz 2008 works with the concept of “prototype,” I prefer the notion of “secondary agent” (Pongratz-Leisten 2011a). 214 Selz 2008, 18 and Chapter 5.1 of this book. 215 Selz 2008, 19. 216 Pongratz-Leisten 2011a.



Sacralizing the Regalia of Kingship 443
The agency of deified objects is apparent in the fact that in the AssyroBabylonian Weltanschauung there were limitations when these iconic emblems happened to fall into the hands of usurpers. In the Anzû Myth, for instance, the lion-eagle Anzû poses a threat to the cosmic order who can wield power effectively once he steals the Tablet of Destinies from its rightful owner Enlil, the chief god of the Babylonian pantheon. Anzû cannot, however, perform the office of kingship because the gods do not accept the legitimacy of his status. Accordingly, “offices, insignia, and office holders all advance claims which are most effective when correlated with one another.”217 The ritual context of the king’s “negative confession” during the Babylonian akītu-festival offers a perfect example for the correlation between office, insignia, and office holder, as the word of the king is considered effective and worthy of the acceptance of the people represented by the priest only if he is the rightful occupant of the office and has correctly performed his duties toward Marduk and the Babylonian elites.218 A similar notion of legitimacy has been noted in the Assyrian rituals with regard to Aššur’s crown, as its legitimizing potential is enforced through the cult for the ancestors. As stated above, the regalia of kingship – the scepter, crown, and throne were conceived of as being of divine origin, a concept whose literary origins can be traced back to the myth of the Eridu Genesis. In that text, the notion that the emblems originate with the divine represents a strategy for sacralizing the institution of kingship:
When the royal [sce]pter (giššibir nam-lugal-la) was com[ing] down from heaven, the august [cr]own (men-mah) and the royal [th]rone (gu-za nam-lugal-la) being already down from heaven, he (the king) [regularly] performed to perfection the august divine services and offices (garza me mah), laid [the bricks] of those cities [in pure spots.] They were [n]amed by name and [al]lotted [ha]lf-bushel baskets.219
Accordingly, whoever performed the office of kingship in the rightful possession of the royal insignia implicitly asserted a connection to the gods mediated through a line of kings220 that reached back to the time before the flood. The deification of the royal insignia – attested from the Early Dynastic period through to the Neo-Assyrian period – and the ascription of agency to them confirms the notion that they were originally regarded as the property of the gods, who entrusted them to the legitimate ruler.

444 The Reinvention of Tradition: The Assyrian State Rituals
A ritual centered on the purification and animation of the royal insignia served to ensure the king’s effective and successful performance of the duties of his office.221 Among these insignia were the royal garments, the throne, the scepter, the tiara, the weapon, the bow, the staff, and the jewelry. The ceremony probably took place in the temple222 where the mīs pî and purification rites were enacted upon the garment, the throne, and the ritual throne at night, under the stars, thus indicating that the ceremony must have been performed on the roof or in the courtyard of the temple. These insignia were then placed before the following gods and stars, who were addressed with prayers: Enlil, Ištar, Anu, Nusku, Ursa Minor, Sîn, Gula, Šamaš, Papsukkal, Ea, Marduk, Zarpanītu, Nabû, and Tašmētu. Preparations for the installation of the king ensued, beginning with an incantation for Šamaš, Ea, and Marduk-Asalluhi, and followed by the king’s prayers to his personal god and goddess. Subsequently, the exorcists (mašmaššu) gave all the royal insignia to the king while reciting incantations as the king faced toward the east, probably toward the rising sun. The king then returned to the palace facing north. He was given the boomerang and underwent an exorcistic ritual involving the release of a bird. Another incantation followed and then the text breaks off. The principal reason that this ritual should not be identified as the coronation ritual is that the participants differ; in the actual coronation ritual it was the šangû-priest who installed the king, while in this ritual the cultic experts involved are the exorcists. This prescriptive ritual should be categorized as the annual reaffirmation of the king in his office. The king participates actively in the ceremony, and he again does so in his role as Ninurta. This is indicated by the incantation that he himself recites when he is invested with the insignia of royalty:
1 He stands before the Gate of the Sunrising223, you put ... 2 All baldric you put on it, respectively one exorcist stands on the right and the left side of the king. 3 They carry a purification sprinkler.
221 Originally classified as mīs pî (Meier 1937‒38). In his 1966 dissertation on the mīs pî ritual, Christopher Walker recognized that the various fragments published by Meier belonged to a different ritual, and was followed by Berlejung 1996; for Walker’s publication of the mīs pî ritual see Walker and Dick 2001. 222 On the basis of a recitation from Anu’s New Year festival at Uruk that is known to have been performed at the end of a procession in the temple, Berlejung 1996, 11 fn. 40 and p. 16 assumes that the ritual also started with a procession of the king into the temple. 223 The question is whether this gate can be equated with the city gate known from the Aššur Directory, Menzel 1981, T155, GAB 129 mukin kussî(aš.te) šarrūti (man-ti) = abul niphi (ká.gal kur-i).



Sacralizing the Regalia of Kingship 445
4 You give the scepter to the king and you recite [the incantation “Wood of the S]ea,” 5 You sprinkle water on the tiara, 6 You give the golden tiara and you recite the incantation “Tiara, its Awe-Inspiring Sheen,” 7 You give the bow and you recite the incantation “Long Bow,” 8 You give the staff and you recite the incantation “Great Lord, (clothed in) Awe-Inspiring Sheen,” 9 You give the stones and you recite the incantation “Great Stone, Great Stone.” When you are done with the recitations, 10 and he has put on the golden tiara and the stones, and he carries the scepter in his hand, 11 you receive the bow, the weapon and the staff and you put them on the throne. 12 He prostrates himself, enters the palace and puts his face towards North. 13 You give to him the curved staff and you recite the incantation “I Lifted My Curved Staff.” 14 He puts his hand on the fermenting vat and 15 you make [him recite] “Sirius, who appeases god and humankind,” 16 When he is done with the recitation, he removes the stopper from the fermenting vat.224
Since in this ritual it is the exorcist who bestows the regalia, it seems that the purification ceremony might have been repeated annually.225 Claus Ambos has suggested that it might have been performed together with the bīt salāʾ mê ritual during the Babylonian akītu-festival in the month of Tašritu. While the bīt salāʾ mê ritual was equally performed in Assyria, it seems that there it was linked with the substitute king.226 It should also be noted that in this ritual every object belonging to the king – not only his throne, scepter, and tiara, but also his weapon, bow, staff, and jewelry – is purified and, I suggest, given agency by means of an incantation, which delineates each object’s scope of action in a performative manner. See, for instance, the bilingual incantation addressed to the royal weapon:
58 f. Incantation: Weapon bestowed with namrirru-splendor, made suitable for kingship, 60 f. Eminent miṭṭu-weapon, which is made perfect for the hand (lit.: arm) of the king, 62 f. Surrounded by the ferocious melammu-splendor, to whose side nobody can come close,
224 Text: K 9276+ //BM 64358+; Edition: Berlejung 1996, 8 ff. 225 Suggested by Claus Ambos, who considers thebīt salā’ mê to be part of the annual reenactment of the coronation ceremony performed on Tašritu 7th and 8th, see the note in Sallaberger 2007, 426 § 4.3 and Ambos 2010. 226 SAA 10 219, 309, and 352.

The following lines are lost and then the text turns very fragmentary.227
The royal regalia were made of precious metals and woods, as was the royal throne, which – as is described in Enki and the World Order – was fashioned from the wood of the highland mēsu trees.228 An incantation related to the investiture of the king describes the wood as being brought from Dilmun: “Tree of the Sea grown in the pristine place, oak, mēsu, tree of the Sea, brought from Dilmun, whose destiny is decreed by Enlil ...”229 The tiara or crown is frequently said to be made of gold. Being the most impervious of all metals to rust, gold in Mesopotamia was probably also “understood as a form of matter not subject to the degenerative forces of time.”230 In Assyrian cultural discourse, the royal regalia served simultaneously as concrete instruments of kingship entrusted to the king during the coronation ritual and as the visual symbols of kingship.231 The bestowal of the insignia was conceptualized in both mythology and iconography as an act performed by the gods. This is reflected in an Assyrian ritual commentary that equates the king with Ninurta:
The king, who wears on his head a golden tiara from inside of the temple and sits on a sedan chair, while they carry him and go to the palace, is Ninurta, who avenged his father. The gods his fathers decorated him inside the Ekur, gave him the scepter, throne and the staff, adorned him with the splendor of kingship, and he went out to the mountain.232
A depiction on an Assyrian helmet represents the only pictorial scene dedicated to the theme of royal investiture. It portrays the gods Aššur and Ištar bestowing the regalia of kingship upon the king (fig. 30).233

Sacralizing the Regalia of Kingship 447
Amar Annus has collected the evidence depicting Ninurta as the holder of the royal regalia and has also illuminated parallels between the gods Ninurta and Nabû in the bestowal of royal insignia.234 In the first millennium akītufestival in Babylon, it is Nabû who bestows the royal insignia on the 4th of Nisannu in his temple Nabû ša harê. Nabû adopted this role from Ninurta in Middle Babylonian Nippur, where the Nippur Compendium records that there was a Chapel of the Scepter (é.gišgidru = bīt haṭṭi) that should probably be located in Ninurta’s temple Eumeša. Andrew George suggests that Nabû’s role was modeled on Ninurta and that Ninurta’s ceremonial bestowal was the “prototype after which the priests of Nabû ša harê at Babylon, and later Aššur, modeled their own ritual.”235

11 The Voice of the Scholar
11.1 Tradition and Scholarly Agency
My intention in this book has been twofold: to trace the formation of Assyrian ideological discourse in light of intercultural interaction and as mediated in text, ritual, and imagery throughout the history of Assyria, and to bring to life the agency behind it. As pointed out by Hayim Tadmor, Sargon II’s Eighth Campaign is currently the only text that unequivocally identifies the king’s scholar (ummânu) as the author of a royal inscription.1 Nevertheless, some of the primary characteristics of Assyrian ideology, namely its richness, diversity, intertextuality with literary texts, and intermediality with other media including ritual and image, can only be accounted for if we conceive of the scholars in the entourage of the king as being actively and permanently involved in the construction of his body politic as it was presented to the world and to the gods.2 The discussions in Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight centering on intertextuality between myth, epic, and royal inscriptions and in Chapter Ten on the link between myth and ritual have demonstrated that royal ideology in ancient Near Eastern cultures cannot and should not be treated as a purely political discourse. Rather, ideology implicitly responded to and was in negotiation with the long-existing religious tradition guarded, preserved, and transmitted by hommes de lettres over the course of hundreds and even thousands of years. Although this tradition was subject to historical realities, its notion of kingship in paticular geographical regions proved relatively consistent through the centuries. This consistency also characterizes what I have defined as the typical Tigridian cultural discourse of the end of the third and beginning of the second millennium BCE. The transmission and transfer of Tigridian cultural discourse encompasses Lagaš, Akkad, Ešnunna, Mari, and Aššur from the Pre-Sargonic through to the Old Babylonian period, and was firmly established by the time of Šamšī-Adad I (1808‒1776 BCE). Literati close to the king – including the experts (whether diviners or exorcists) who organized the local cult and calendar in the various centers through which Tigridian cultural discourse spread functioned as the carriers of that cultural interaction, while the efforts of kings to compete with the image-making of their peers served to drive the process of cultural diffusion forward.
1 Tadmor 1997, 328. 2 This was already proposed by Hayim Tadmor in 1981, 31‒32 on the basis of the thoughts of Otto Schroeder and revived again in 1997, 328.



Tradition and Scholarly Agency 449
At the beginning of this book I defined tradition as the growing body of cultural memory informed by social values and practices, which materializes in a constantly reformulated and reconceptualized cultural discourse mediated in myth, historiography, architecture, iconography, and ritual. While there is a conservative element to tradition that aims to preserve the status quo or, as in the Mesopotamian case, strives for a return to the golden age of the time before the flood, the constant reformulation of tradition in cultural discourse and in ideology as its subcategory is in practice an extremely dynamic and innovative process that is always in negotiation with actual historical events. This tension between conservatism on the one hand and re-actualization and reinvention on the other is evident in the development of royal ideological discourse throughout Mesopotamian history. Royal ideological discourse was dominated by particular tropes centered on the king as warrior and as caretaker of the cult, which were formulated for the first time during the Late Uruk period in the emerging city state of Uruk and which survive in both the monumental art and miniature glyptic iconography of the time. This discourse developed further in Pre-Sargonic Lagaš and was then reformulated during the Akkad period in the various media of royal ideology. From there, it inspired the royal discourse of the kingdom of Ešnunna and that of Šamšī-Adad I and was reworked in Old Babylonian myth and in epic literature centered on the Sargonic kings – though the latter facilitated also the articulation of a critical position regarding the institution of kingship. Subsequently, the warrior ideology was reformulated in the Assyrian heroic epics of the Middle Assyrian period before being incorporated in Assyrian royal inscriptions in which it defined the ideal chaîne opératoire for the respective king. In the Tigridian region (i.e. Lagaš, Ešnunna, and Aššur), this ideology centered on the heroic king in the role of the warrior god is – some gaps notwithstanding – preserved in various permutations throughout antiquity, regardless of who was actually in control of a given territory. With regard to the articulation of a particularly Assyrian royal ideological discourse, the evidence suggests three periods of major stimuli: (1) the reign of Šamšī-Adad I, during which an Old Babylonian cultural discourse centered on the kings Sargon and Narām-Sîn of Akkad was introduced to Assyria; (2) the Middle Assyrian period from Adad-nīrārī I (1295‒1264 BCE) onward culminating in the reigns of Tukultī-Ninurta I (1233‒1197 BCE) and Tiglath-Pileser I (1115‒1077 BCE), during which the Ninurta mythology was introduced into Assyrian ideological discourse and a host of regicentric literature centered on the figure of the king was produced; and (3) the Sargonid period, during which control of the stream of tradition is manifest not only in the very existence of Assyria’s extensive libraries, but equally in the creation of a rich corpus of texts

which abound in intertextual relationships and in intermediality with ritual. It is at the very end of the Sargonid period that the iconography of palace reliefs and steles is supplemented by the endeavor to present the king as being in constant dialogue with the gods, an effort apparent in the genres of divine letters to the king and of royal reports to the god Aššur, as well as in the textualization of the Ištar oracles and in unique compositions like the Fictive Dialogue between Ashurbanipal and Nabû.
Such a dynamic interaction with tradition implies that at any given historical moment the king and the scholars were in intense conversation, since they had to agree on the ideological message that they ultimately intended to convey.3 Accordingly, this final chapter scrutinizes the various settings in which scholarly agency (as exercised by scholars in the entourage of the king) might be discernible.
11.2 The Scholars at the Assyrian Court
Explicit references to cooperation between Assyrian kings and their scholars are scarce prior to the surviving correspondence between Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal and their scholars, which allows us to establish nuanced profiles for some of the experts consulted by these two kings. Until the Sargonid period, scholars as individuals are thus consigned almost entirely to the shadows. Occasionally, however, either through the coincidental discovery of their seals or their libraries or through particular collections of texts, it is possible to gain some insight into the actual persons acting on behalf of royal interests. Although scholars must have been associated with the Assyrian royal court from very early on, a chief scholar tied to the king (as indicated by the title ‘scribe of the king’, ṭupšar šarri) only emerges as a distinct figure in the textual sources under Aššur-uballiṭ I (1353‒1318 BCE). This ṭupšar šarri can be considered the predecessor of the later ummânū, who are listed together with the kings that they served in the Synchronistic King List.4 In addition to this kind of explicit reference, several scribes and scholars are attested in the colophons of literary and lexical texts from the first half of the 12th century BCE at Aššur, bearing witness to lively literary creativity at the time of Aššur’s expansion toward the west, when the city gained control over what had been Hanigalbat
3 A similar scenario has been suggested by Machinist 2003b. 4 This interpretation follows Grayson 1980, 117 who edited the Synchronistic King List, which mentions Issar-šumu-ēresh as the chief astrologer under Esarhaddon and his predecessor Nabû-zēru-lēšir, who is identified as rab ṭupšarrī.

up to the Balih River under the kings Tukultī-Ninurta I (1233‒1197 BCE) and Tiglath-Pileser I (1115‒1077 BCE). Middle Assyrian titles such as ‘diviner of the king’ (bāri šarre)5 and ‘exorcist of the king’ (āšip šarre)6 point to the existence of close relationships between the king and scholars; the continuity of such intimate working relationships is indicated by the aforementioned Synchronistic King List. The Synchronistic King List was first composed under Ashurbanipal (668‒631/27? BCE) or shortly thereafter, and the list originally commenced with the kings Erišum I of Assyria and Sumulael of Babylonia and ended with Ashurbanipal/Kandalanu. The Assyrian King List, Babylonian King List, and Chronicles must have formed the Vorlage for the Synchronistic King List, which lists the names of the chief scholars of the respective kings of Assyria and Babylonia alongside the names of the kings themselves from the tenth century onward. Two chief scholars are listed for Sennacherib, namely the Babylonian astrologer Bēl-upahhir and Kalbu, who eventually conspired against the king.7 The extensive collections of epistolary literature, extispicy queries, and astrological reports from the Late Sargonid period represent the most lively witnesses to the cooperation between Assyrian kings and their Assyrian and Babylonian scholars.8 Both the king and the scholars participated in the effort to assemble comprehensive libraries, which not only reflected the cultural knowledge of the time but, as demonstrated by the extremely large number of divination texts and texts related to exorcistic lore, were also intended to respond to the challenges posed by everyday politics.9 In some cases scholars are referred to by name, and are thus identifiable as individuals. Particularly rich evidence survives from the reign of Adad-nīrārī III (809‒783 BCE, Nimrud) and the Sargonid period, as libraries have been excavated in Sennacherib’s Southwest Palace, Ashurbanipal’s North Palace, the temples of Nabû and Ištar on the royal citadel in Nineveh, and the temple of Nabû in Nimrud.10 These finds are complemented by the discoveries from Aššur, which include traces of Middle and Neo-Assyrian libraries in the Aššur temple and the library of a family of exorcists.11 Colophons preserved on tablets from these libraries allow us to

reconstruct several scholarly families who served numerous Assyrian kings; in some cases, these families appear to have been of Babylonian origin.12 Close cooperation between kings and scholars can occasionally be documented over several generations, as is the case for Adad-šuma-iṣṣur, who was not only an eminent exorcist and advisor of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, but also the grandson of Gabbi-ilāni-ēreš, himself a scholar of Ashurnasirpal II and Tukultī-Ninurta II. The brother of Adad-šuma-iṣṣur was Nabû-zēru-lēšir, who similarly worked as chief scribe and scholar under Esarhaddon and who was succeeded in this capacity by his descendant Issar-šumu-ēreš. Both Adadšuma-iṣṣur and Nabû-zēru-lēšir were sons of the illustrious Nabû-zuqup-kēnu, well-known for his “editorial work from tablets dated in the reigns of Sargon and Sennacherib from Nineveh,”13 some of which were written in Nimrud. Nabû-zuqup-kēnu’s library primarily comprised omen texts, but also included Tablet XII of the Gilgamesh Epic, which seems to be the only extant literary tablet written by him.14 Whether the cache of 400 tablets found in Sultantepe was intended to be kept safe from invaders around 610 BCE is not clear, but their scribes are all known to have been members of a family of šangûs in the service of the gods Zababa and Bau of Arbail, including Qurdī-Nergal and his sons Mušallim-Bau and Nabû-zēr-kitti-lēšir.15 A fragmentary letter from the reign of Sargon II (721‒705 BCE) suggests that the Babylonian king Marduk-apla-iddina II collected the writing boards stored in the temple library and hid them away in a safe place to prevent them from being pillaged by the Assyrian king.16 Cooperation between the king and his scholars is vividly reflected in a letter of Ashurbanipal, preserved in two copies, in which the king commands his scholars to collect all texts from private scholarly collections in Babylonia that were not yet included in the collections of the libraries of Nineveh:
1Message of the king to Šadānu: 2I am well, you may be content. 3As soon as you read this tablet, 4take Šumâ, son of Šumu-ukīn, 5Bēl-ēṭir, his brother, 6Aplâ, son of Arkat-ilāni, 7and the scholars of Borsippa, whom you know 8and tablets, as much as there are in their houses, 9and tablets, as much as there are stored in Ezida, 10dig out.

In this particular case, the response of the scholars of Borsippa is preserved in a letter written in a beautiful style, which, as indicated by its colophon, became part of the scribal tradition:
By command of Bēl and Bēltiya, let it be a success! To Ashurbanipal, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king who can do as he pleases, [to whom Marduk, who dwells in E-sangil,] 2gave charge and delegated the kingship of Assyria and (on whom) he conferred the kingship of the entire country, (who) grasps in his hand a fair scepter [that subdues] 3the insubmissive, (who) bears in his right hand the staff that lays low the aggressor, on whom Nabû, who dwells [in Ezida,] 4bestowed broad understanding and who like me is bowed to the scribal art, we send [word, thus:]
5May the great lord Marduk, who dwells in E-sangil and determines destinies, bestow on you as a gift a fair scepter, a true staff 6and a magnificent crown! May Nabû, who dwells in E-zida, intercede for you 7before Marduk, the father who sired him! May Nanāya, the lady of E-ur-šaba, lay low your enemy and destroy your [foe]! 8Further: The dutiful Borsippans will send back to the king the instruction that he wrote 9as follows, “Write out all the scribal learning in the property of Nabû and send it to me. 10Complete the instruction!” Maybe the king says to himself, we (are ones) who, like the citizens of Babylon, will shirk (it) 11by (using) confusing language. Now, we shall not shirk the king’s command. We shall strain and toil day and night to complete the instruction for our lord the king. 12We shall write on boards of sissoo-wood, we shall respond immediately! And regarding the board in Sumerian, the glossary 13about which you sent word, there is none but that in E-sangil. Let enquiries now be made before our lord the king. 14[You should] send word to the citizens of Babylon. Our destiny and their destiny 15are [...] like [...] that they possess judgments and decisions, (is) true 16 [...] in Babylon [...] ... with them, our lord the king. We shall write 17[...] ...

Note that in his letter Ashurbanipal requests original clay tablets, while the Borsippan scholars respond that they will deliver writing boards – probably because they wished to retain the original tablets in their own library.19 The inventory tablets of Nineveh’s libraries20 reflect the intense acquisition of tablets following Ashurbanipal’s destruction of Babylon in 647 BCE: “Approximately two thousand tablets and three hundred writing boards were taken from Assyrian and Babylonian private scholars, who gave away compositions they did not need for their professional work.”21 The colophons of tablets from the Nineveh libraries identify them as the property of the royal palace (tuppi/uʾilti Aššur-bāni-apli, and ekal Aššur-bāni-apli) and promote the king as the patron of the arts. During the Late Neo-Assyrian period this discourse developed from a portrayal of the king as a ‘collector’ and ‘connoisseur’ of cultural knowledge to a deliberate representation of the king as a sage and active participant in scholarly discourse, who was fully conversant in the divinatory techniques. This development is first apparent in Esarhaddon’s claim that he separated the diviners into several groups in order to compare the results of their respective extispicies.22 This motif also occurs in the composition Sin of Sargon, which probably dates to Esarhaddon’s reign:
(10) “[Let me examine] by means of extispicy the sin of Sargon, my father, let me then determine [the circumstances] and le[arn the ......; let me make] the sin he committed against the god an abom[ination to myself], and with the god’s help let me safe myself”. (13) I w[ent and collected the haruspices], who guard the secret of the god and king, the courtiers of my palace, divided them [into several (lit. three or four) groups] so that they could not ap[proach or speak to one another], and [investigated] the sins of Sargon, my father, by extispicy, [inquiring of Šamaš and Adad].”23

The Scholars at the Assyrian Court 455
By the time of Ashurbanipal, this theme is elaborated so that the king himself now claims to have learned how to interpret the written sources and to perform divination:
I have mastered the craft of the sage Adapa, the guarded secret(s) of the whole scribal art. I can observe the signs of the heavens and the earth and discuss them in the meetings of the scholars, I am capable of debating with the learned oil masters the (chapter of the diviner manual entitled) “if the liver is a correspondence of the sky,” and I can solve the most complicated mathematical divisions and multiplications that have no solution (provided with the problem). I have read the most complicated (bilingual) text whose Sumerian is obscure, and whose Akkadian version is difficult to unravel. I have studied stone inscriptions from before the flood of the complicated (text whose opening line is) kakku sakku.24
Whether Ashurbanipal really acquired the ability to check his scholars’s interpretations of the liver, “to correct imprecise citations” of texts by reference to the originals, and whether he indeed knew, “independently, when his course of action was correct,”25 must remain open to debate.26 Ashurbanipal’s patronage of scholarly work – as realized in his library – should, however, certainly be considered as “the material realization of an elementary principle of political behavior: that is, that culture and art are intimately connected with the art of government. Like Cosimo and Lorenzo de’ Medici, both warriors and politicians who strongly favored new editions of Classical texts, and, more generally cultural and artistic development, Ashurbanipal was deeply convinced that enhancing culture was one of the most powerful instruments of political control.”27 The trope of the king’s involvement in the discovery of the divine will through divinatory means, as addressed in both the royal inscriptions and the epistolary literature, is equally apparent in the literary texts of the first millennium. The late version of the Cuthean Legend, for example, stresses that the king should communicate and interact with the gods through divination and adhere to the conclusions of the divinatory process, while the first millennium version of the Gilgameš Epic and the Cuthean Legend both emphasize the importance of transmitting knowledge gained through experience to future gener

ations. It therefore comes as no surprise that copies of these texts have been recovered from the royal Assyrian libraries, underscoring the importance of these notions to the Assyrian conception of successful kingship.
11.3 The King as Sage and the Mobilization of Asymmetrical Relationships
From Sennacherib onward cultural accomplishments involving knowledge of divination and other skills were ascribed to the mythical sage Adapa. Alongside the image of the king as successful warrior, the image of the knowledgeable, skillful, and wise king – often through the evocation of the Adapa motif developed into a powerful constituent of the royal body politic in Assyrian ideological discourse. Sennacherib’s Bull Inscription, which is concerned with the building of his “Palace-Without-Rival,” combines the motif of the skillful and knowledgeable king with an intertextual reference to the myths of The Creation of Man and King and Atrahasīs by dwelling on the role of the mother goddess Bēlet-ilī and the god Ea in his conception:
“Bēlet-ilī, the goddess of procreation, looked upon me with favor (while I was still in the womb of the mother who bore me, and watched over my conception, while the god Ninšiku (Ea) provided a spacious womb and granted me vast comprehension.”28
In the building inscription dedicated to his construction of the arsenal in Nimrud, Esarhaddon (680‒669 BCE) extols himself in the following terms:
“As for me, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, pious prince, to whom the prince, the god Ninšiku (Ea), gave (wisdom) equal to that of the sage Adapa, that terrace was on my mind and I (text: “he”) thought about it. I incorporated unused land as an addition (and) raised the terrace with massive stone blocks from the mountains.”29
The Adapa motif was not only incorporated in the royal inscriptions, but equally came to be embraced as a trope by the king’s scholars, albeit for a slightly different purpose: they employed it to emphasize their asymmetrical relationship with the king. In a very fragmentary letter, the chief haruspex of Ashurbanipal compares the deeds of Esarhaddon to those of Adapa,30 while he locates the king in the direct lineage of the antediluvian sage:
28 OIP 2, 117, Undated Bull inscription (I 1). 29 RINAP 4, no. 77: 45‒49. 30 SAA 10 380 3′‒4′: epšētu šarri [bēlīya] / [a]na ša adapi mušlā, “Now, th[en], the deeds of the king, [my lord], are like those of (the sage) Adapa.”



The King as Sage and the Mobilization of Asymmetrical Relationships 457
Aššur, in a dream, called the grandfather of the king, my lord, a sage (apkallu); the king, lord of the kings, is an offspring of a sage (apkalli) and Adapa: You have surpassed the wisdom of the Abyss and all scholarship.31
Likewise, Ashurbanipal’s chief astrologer emphasizes the king’s “membership” in the learned circle of scholars by acknowledging his education as a scholar:
[The king, my lord], is made [li]ke a sage; he has understood their counsels ...32
The use of the trope could even be extended to the queen mother:
... – the mother of the king is as able as the (sage) Adapa!33
These quotations from the letters of scholars not only reflect the seminal role of scholars in shaping the ideological discourse centered on the image of the king, but are also very revealing with regard to how the scholars positioned themselves in direct relation to the king. By assigning the role of Adapa – the mythic heros eponymos of their guild – to the king, the scholars simultaneously positioned the king in close proximity to the gods and defined him as the mediating channel between themselves and the gods. Even while stressing their asymmetrical relationship with the king, however, the scholars obliquely insinuated that cultural authority now lay with the sages, i.e. scholars, rather than with the antediluvian kings. When used by the scholars to honor the king as their social superior, the trope of comparing the king to Adapa thus had a twofold effect. Although it distinguished the king from the rest of the population, it also entailed obligations toward and dependencies on those who elevated him to his lofty position, i.e. the members of the political and scholarly elites. Accordingly, the rhetoric of exclusivity bound up with limited access to knowledge and the designation of the king as the ultimate source of authority constituted a notion of distinctiveness that also encompassed the scholarly elites. Texts like the Catalogue of Texts and Authors,34 which establishes an intellectual genealogy of scholars that originates with the god Ea, and the Enmeduranki Legend, which identifies the king as the mediator between the gods and the scholars,35 were both found in the libraries of Nineveh and constitute literary reflections on this self-definition of the scholarly

elites, implicitly defining them as central and indispensable to royal achievement.36 Cultural texts like omen compendia and myths were understood to be divine creations, as is illustrated by the Catalogue of Texts and Authors and the Enmeduranki Legend and its attendant commentary literature.37 The former text, with its particular assemblage of titles belonging to the body of traditional texts, demonstrates that Assyrian scholars conceived of a close relationship between magical knowledge and political leadership. The Catalogue of Texts and Authors begins by referring to the knowledge of the exorcist and the astrologer, as represented by the titles of important omen compendia, and to the Ninurta mythology, as expressed through the titles of two major poems dealing with Ninurta’s deeds (in which Ninurta functions as the divine model of the human king); the origin of all of these texts is assigned to the god Ea. This combination of texts and their attribution to Ea – who, with his son MardukAsalluhi, should be regarded as the patron god of magic and pragmatic knowledge – offers a valuable insight into the ancient vision of kingship, with regard both to kingship’s interaction with divination and to the role kingship was assigned in ancient historiography. In his capacity as administrator of Enlil and as warrior defending the cosmic order against chaos, Ninurta epitomizes the ancient conceptualization of the mission of kingship. Foreknowledge of the divine will was crucial to successful royal performance, as royal actions had to align with the original cosmic scheme and with the notion of kittu, cosmic truth and stability. By coupling divination and the Ninurta mythology under the aegis of the god Ea in the ancient Catalogue, scholars inscribed the mandate of kingship into the cosmic scheme designed by the gods. In shaping the image of royal perfection, the scholars stressed the king’s expertise and scholarly knowledge, which allowed him to access the divine world and maintain the cosmic order. Interestingly, it is in the late Sargonid period, when the scholars had long since managed to secure their position at the Assyrian royal court and had made themselves indispensable through their authoritative knowledge of extispicy, astrology, and exorcism, that they active
36 Machinist 2003b. 37 Frahm 2011, 24; such reasoning entails a different notion of the sacredness of the text, as the notion of inalterability applies to the content rather than to the textualization process of the individual text. Notwithstanding the message of the colophons affirming that the scribe did not alter the text, there was no notion of a closed canon. Rather, the ancients considered their cultural texts as part of the cosmic truth and stability (kittu) determined by divine decree in the mythical past; see Démare-Lafont 2011.



The King as Sage and the Mobilization of Asymmetrical Relationships 459
ly stressed the superiority of the king and concomitantly their asymmetrical relationship with him. Epithets describing the king as the “image of the god” (tamšīlu) or as the “flesh of the god” (šīru) are attested primarily in letters written by scholars to the king in which the king’s absolute power and authority is emphasized explicitly. The context for the verbal iteration of this asymmetrical relationship is always linked to the expression of a scholar’s gratitude or obligation to the king. In this vein, the royal advisor Adad-šumu-uṣur expresses his gratitude to Esarhaddon for having decided to retain him and his family in the royal entourage by likening the king’s will to the will of the god Marduk in his capacity for care:
“The father of the king, my lord, was the image of Bēl, And the king, my lord, is the image of Bēl.”38
A passage from an astrological report to the king (perhaps Esarhaddon) is even more explicit, as it plays with an opposing couplet that refers both to Marduk’s care and to his devastating wrath, a motif well known from prayer literature and Ludlul Bēl Nēmeqi:
“The compassionate Lord, the warrior Marduk, Was angry at night, but relented in the morning. O king of the world, you are the very image of Marduk. When you were angry, we suffered the anger of the king our lord, (but) we (also) saw the king relent.”39
In another letter the king is equated with the sun god, an image that emerges in Assyrian ideology in the time of Tukultī-Ninurta I (1233‒1177 BCE) as part of the discourse relating to the solarization of divine and human kingship. As Peter Machinist stresses, the ruler’s sovereign control over the known world is akin to the sun god’s manifestation of “the light of his rule over the world.”40 In one of his letters, Adad-šumu-uṣur plays with this metaphor to persuade Esarhaddon – who is suffering from an illness – to show himself to his officials and assert his authority:
Why, then, today, for the second time, has this table not been brought before the king, my lord? Who is in the dark longer than Šamaš, the king of the gods ‒ staying in the dark
38 LAS I no. 228 obv. 18‒19. 39 SAA 8 no. 333. 40 Machinist 2006, 172.



460 The Voice of the Scholar
for a full day and a night, even for two days? The king, the lord of all the lands, is the very image of Šamaš. He should be in the dark for (only) half a day.41
In one of his letters, Adad-šumu-uṣur elaborates on a proverb by playing with the double meaning of the word ṣillu, which means either “shadow” or “likeness/image:”
“The shadow of god is man, and the shadow of man is man.” (This man is) the king, (for) he is the likeness of the god (muššuli ša ili).”42
These textual sources reveal a scholarly elite that draws on exclusive ritual and theological knowledge to secure its elevated status and to distinguish itself from the rest of the population, even as it takes great care to emphasize the king’s uncontested authority. The more that the scholars usurped rhetorical strategies formerly reserved for the king, however, the more they limited the reservoir of strategies that could convey the king’s ultimate authority and unrivalled status. The Enmeduranki Legend is illustrative of the way that scholars could work to reinforce their position in the social hierarchy. In this text, haruspices tie themselves to the king while emphasizing their privileged origin in the ancient cult centers, going so far as to exclude colleagues from the rest of Babylonia. The legend exemplifies how scholars could situate themselves alongside the king in the direct line of the transfer of divine knowledge, and is therefore a clear example of scholars co-opting the institution of kingship in order to strengthen their own position. The textual evidence points to a complex balance between power and authority. In Mesopotamia, power and authority were not united seamlessly in a single agent.43 While power was the preserve of the king – who could make life and death decisions regarding his subjects and treat his scholars abominably – the scholars nevertheless retained their authoritative voice as the rightful guardians of tradition. In assuming their role as transmitters and producers of symbolic systems and cultural practices, the scholars played a key role in creating the authority of kingship. While political elites could choose to ignore their scholarly advisors, in the end they could not escape the cultural definition of the universal order articulated by the scholars and the place that kingship was assigned within it. Together with the palace officials and the clergy of the temples, whose power derived from their control over substantial economic resources, the

Texts as the Voices of the Scholars 461
scholars tacitly acknowledged the hierarchical relations of power and actively contributed to its symbolic system, which was ultimately deployed in diverse media including text, ritual, and image. These various social groups constituted both the agents in and the audience of the public manifestation of power and authority. They were all actively engaged in the production and reproduction of the ceremonial etiquette, the code of gestures, officially prescribed rites, and the language of power.44 The dynamic interaction between the king and the scholars in designing the royal body politic demonstrates that “power” and “authority” were relational concepts that even in the Assyrian monarchical system were built on constellations of social groups and interdependencies.45 These power relations were reflected and publicized in the constellations of the gods in the polytheistic pantheon, who entered a process of mutual legitimization together with the king. Accordingly, rather than thinking in terms of totalitarian and despotic power, we should aim to decode the cultural strategies deployed by the political and religious elites to construct social distinction and to define their position of authority and prestige. My emphasis here, of course, is on the participation of the elites in shaping and sharing the discourse of power. As pointed out by Jean-Jacques Glassner,46 the king and the political elites originated in the same social class, and very often the highest offices were occupied by members of the royal family, groups that were close to the royal family, and other people of social prestige. This type of interdependent social fabric already existed in the archaic period47 and persisted throughout the history of Mesopotamia. It functioned on the basis of familial relationships, as well as on the principle of exchange of gifts and royal grants. Nonetheless, over the centuries we constantly see the king deploying additional strategies to define his authority, which operated on the notion of limited access (as expressed in architecture and protocol), invisibility, and exclusivity.

texts themselves as evidence of the presence of scholars in the entourage of the king and as carriers of tradition. Since it is possible to draw a distinction between bureaucratic literacy and higher education, the presence of literary texts indicates the presence of people capable of engaging with the cultural discourse. There is clear evidence of intense communication between educated scribes or scholars from Aššur and learned circles further south at the beginning of the second millennium BCE. Of particular significance in this respect is the creation of an Assyrian Sargon Legend rich in allusions to literary texts from the Sumero-Babylonian horizon,48 the discovery of Old Assyrian incantations, some of which contain traces of Hymnic Epical Dialect,49 the unearthing of an exemplar of the Sumerian King List at Tell Leilan, and the elaborate and culturally rich character of Šamšī-Adad I’s inscriptions. I have suggested that the schools of the kingdom of Ešnunna (including Meturan and Šaduppum) might be one of the key venues through which the Babylonian stream of tradition was transmitted to Aššur. This possibility gains further credence from the fact that traces of a school tradition that includes a royal ideological discourse are already attested at Ešnunna during the Akkad period,50 thus testifying to a longstanding scholarly tradition in that eastern Tigridian kingdom. This ‘school of Ešnunna’ may ultimately derive in large measure from the cultural traditions that developed in the city state of Lagaš during the Pre-Sargonic period. Lagaš was a powerful city-state and continued to be an important economic center through the Old Akkadian period and into the Ur III period. The importance and continuity of the culture of Lagaš is apparent in the adoption of its calendar by the craftsmen’s guilds of the Ur III state.51 Similarly, the iconography of Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures provided the model for the later steles of King Sargon (Louvre Sb 2/6053), for Narām-Sîn’s Victory Stele, and for the Daduša Stele, which depicts the king smiting the enemy in the role of Ninurta. Lagaš, Ešnunna, and Aššur all share a conception of the status of the city-ruler vis-à-vis the city god that is expressed in the title ensi2, along with commonalities in their royal inscriptions, particularly regarding their extensive military reports. These cultural similarities support the idea that there

was a network of scholarly communication and transmission along the Tigris River. When the evidence from Mari is included in this picture – as attested in the inscriptions of Yahdun-Līm – it becomes possible to delineate a network of intense scribal and scholarly interaction and to define a northern cultural horizon that encompassed Ešnunna, Aššur, and Mari. This interaction may have promoted and facilitated the movement of Babylonian scholars to Aššur and Šubat-Enlil. The contribution of the Sargonic kings to later Assyrian ideological discourse, as mediated through Šamšī-Adad I, cannot be overemphasized in this dynamic. It is unique in the development of intertextuality in Mesopotamia insofar as it is the only example of an ideological discourse formulated in royal inscriptions that went on to impact the production of mythic and legendary texts rather than the other way around. The Sargonic contribution promoted the creation of a rich corpus of legends centered on the kings Sargon and Narām-Sîn. During the Old Babylonian period, the intertextual relationship between the Old Assyrian Sargon Legend and one of Šamšī-Adad I’s commemorative inscriptions represents the earliest example of the epic tradition influencing the rhetoric of royal inscriptions, in this case with regard to the geographical notion that the territory controlled by Sargon extended from the Mediterranean Sea to the region of the Turukkeans. From the Middle Assyrian period onward myth and epic formed the primary platform for the debate on kingship; the fruits of such reflection then percolated into the royal inscriptions of the Assyrian kings. The dynamics by which epic or mythical discourse articulated particular thoughts and concepts about the institution of kingship that were subsequently incorporated into royal ideology are apparent, for example, in the TukultīNinurta Epic. This epic – which draws on the Etana Myth – anticipates a rhetoric that justifies the military campaigns of Assyrian kings with reference to the treacherous behavior of their enemies, a rhetoric that was ultimately integrated into Assyrian royal inscriptions.52 In addition to their use of the Standard Babylonian dialect, the distinct literariness of Assyrian royal inscriptions is evident in their emplotment, which follows the gist of the combat myth or other mythic narratives. Further, figurative speech and intertextual literary allusions have been noted as expressions of the scholarly voice underlying royal inscriptions (see Chapters Six, Seven and Eight). But it is possible go much further. The form and content of particular texts, as well as the meaning that they gain though their relationship with other

texts53 – as discussed in Chapter Eight – are to my mind key indicators of a highly erudite circle of scholars responsible for the production of cultural discourse in general and of ideology as its subdiscourse in particular. Instead of adhering to a Western notion of authorship,54 treating the literary qualities and cultural sophistication of ancient Mesopotamian texts as witnesses to the voice of the scholar appears to me to be a legitimate means of bringing the producers of ideological discourse into the foreground. It should be kept in mind that during the Sargonid period cuneiform writing was still a privileged vehicle for the preservation and production of cultural memory. Cuneiform signs are polysemic and can be read as logograms, phonetic elements, or classifiers.55 Cuneiform writing, moreover, always has the potential to be read logographically and can represent multiple languages simultaneously, resulting in a level of semantic flexibility that is particularly evident in the fluidity marking the relationship between written Sumerian and Akkadian.56 This semantic flexibility generated a scholarly mindset that was necessarily adept in the production of textual interpretations and commentaries. In addition to fostering “scribal traditionalism in the antiquarian devotion to a script and language,”57 this scholarly mindset promoted a predilection for the various forms of intertextuality discussed throughout this book. Cuneiform texts transcend their plain meaning and were not written or read with only the most obvious interpretations in mind; the intertextuality and intermediality of text, ritual, and image serve as an inexhaustible reservoir for those seeking to read between the lines, with reference either to the polysemy of the signs and icons themselves or with the reference to the rich web of discursive expressions pertaining to cultural memory. The transmedial scope of my analysis in this book has focused primarily on myth, royal inscription, and ritual, and has outlined the procedures for worldconstruction in these contexts, revealing in the process the mythic dimensions of the narrative way of world-making.58 The “storyworld” of the combat myth enabled us to make “inferences about situations, characters, and occurrences

either explicitly mentioned in or implied by a narrative text or discourse.”59 As such, the combat myth serves as a mental model “of situations and events being recounted ‒ of who did what to and with whom, when where, why, and in what manner.”60 This storyworld cuts across media, genres, and communicative contexts to fashion the image of the Assyrian king and to manipulate and communicate the experience of the institution of kingship. Although a core of world-making procedures is common to the various media and text categories, the choice of genre retains its meaning with regard to conditioning the reception of a particular message. In regicentric literature – including heroic poems and royal inscriptions – and in ritual, for instance, the historical king is introduced into a framework articulated and defined by myth. The discussion of various text categories has revealed that the choice of genre is crucial in the process of meaning-production. While the legends centered on the kings of Akkad stylize these figures as models of kingship and are much more diversified in their choice of motifs, individual kings aspired to demonstrate in their inscriptions that they had met the cultural expectations associated with kingship. In other words, narrative structures functioned as carriers of meaning, constituting content61 and shaping the royal message. The poetic or narrative form thus extended and concretized the meaning-production generated by myth, while its aesthetic dimension informed its reception. Particular choices concerning world-making procedures were made by scholars and are already apparent in Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures (PreSargonic), the victory steles of the kings of Akkad, and the steles of Daduša and Šamšī-Adad I. Beyond the medium of the image, these world-making procedures are evident in the literary texts and royal inscriptions contemporary to these monuments. Intertextuality between texts and intermediality between image, text, and ritual enhanced the efficaciousness of the message that was conveyed. As is clear from the collections of rituals, incantations, omen reports, and omen series that have been recovered from the libraries of scribes and scholars, the authors or text producers of these works were concerned with the supervision of, involvement in, or simply being knowledgeable about cultic, divinatory and exorcistic practices. The earlier chapters of this book demonstrate that dividing the production of texts along ‘historiographic’, ‘literary,’ and practice oriented lines is inappropriate. Although the educational process pertaining to liturgical, magical, and divinatory texts might have differed from the educa

466 The Voice of the Scholar
tional process related to the broader bureaucratic curriculum in the Old Babylonian period,62 it is obvious that scholars, whether diviners or exorcists, were responsible for scribal training and the production of texts unrelated to the curriculum. In light of this, it must be asked whether a clear-cut distinction between the supposedly independent school milieu of the Old Babylonian period and the purely utilitarian scribalism in thrall to the royal court that has been posited for the first millennium can still be maintained.63 It is true that except for the Erra Epic few new major mythical narratives were produced during the first millennium, but many other genres of a highly literary character were created, revealing that while scholarship was steeped in the stream of tradition, it nevertheless retained its creativity and inventiveness and devised new forms of expression. The libraries of exorcists in both Old Babylonian Meturan and in Sargonid Aššur are remarkably similar with regard to the social standing of their owners, who were authoritative figures involved in the production of world-making; further, the houses to which these two libraries belong have in common their role as institutions concerned with collecting and producing scholarly lore (see especially texts such as the Sargon Geography and the Weidner Chronicle in the exorcist’s library in Aššur), their work on behalf of the palace, and their function as centers of education. Hard evidence of a close relationship between intellectual loci of this kind and the palace is tenuous for the early periods, but surviving texts and monuments indicate that such cooperation was standard. The kings relied on the scholars as the authoritative guardians of tradition, who could shape the royal image at any given historical moment. For the Tigridian area at least, then, the sweeping claims made by some modern scholars – particularly those interested primarily in the literary, lexical, and mathematical text corpus from Southern Babylonia concerning the independence of scholarship in the Old Babylonian period should be reconsidered. The chapters of this book have opened a succession of windows that are intended to offer some insight into what a discussion of royal ideology in its relationship to religion and cultural discourse actually entails. By adopting a diachronic approach, I demonstrated how tropes accumulated and were reworked through time. The complexity that characterizes Sargonid period cultural production represents the culmination of the work of scholarly circles concerned with shaping Mesopotamian cultural discourse over the course of millennia. This chapter has demonstrated once again that those texts, images, and rituals that fashioned the image of the body politic of the Assyrian king

Texts as the Voices of the Scholars 467
could only have been created by scholars very well versed in the various media that constituted the cultural memory of Assyria and Babylonia. Far more than a scholarly demonstration of erudition and skill in handling various media was at stake, however. Anchoring a text, image, or ritual in the rich web of intertextuality and intermediality created or made visible a particular truth, a truth that connected historical reality with the mythic past and thereby sanctioned the individual ruler as the legitimate occupant of the royal throne.

Commentary:
Vs. 1 The participle lāʾitu normally refers to gods rather than humans, see CAD L, 113 s.v. lâṭu. The expression dāʾiš nakirīšu, by contrast, is a typical epithet of the Assyrian king, see CAD D, 121 s.v. dâšu. The occurrence of an anaptyctic vowel to dissolve a consonant cluster is typical of Neo-Assyrian and indicates the transitional linguistic stage of the Assyrian language towards the end of the second millennium. It occurs several times in this text: iṣiniqanâši (l. 9); šupatāni (l. 12); siqirīšunu (l. 16); iṣimedi (l. 22); ūšerriṭi (rev. 3); lazzammuru (rev. 7), see Luukko, SAAS 16, pp. 102‒108; Hämeen-Anttila, SAAS 13, pp. 34‒35. Note that according to Luukko, SAAS 16, p. 102 “anaptyctic vowels always follow the quality of the preceding vowel.” The word šupatāni (l. 12) seems to go against that rule, since it follows the quality of the following vowel (šuptāni > šupatāni). Anaptyxis thus seems to include regressive vowel dissimilation and progressive vowel assimilation: šuptāni > *šuputāni > šupatāni.
Vs. 2 The occurrence of ‘overhanging’ vowels (überhängende Vokale) is likewise typical of NA: dālihi (l. 2); iṣimedi (l. 22); ūšerriṭi (rev. 3); lazzammuru (rev. 7), see von Soden GAG3, § 18e. Concerning these “overhanging” vowels and their possible syntactical function, see Luukko, SAAS 16, pp. 108‒9.
Vs. 5 ba-A.A.ru must be a nominal form of the participle bāʾeru, see also AHw, vol. 1, 97a, s.v. bajjāru. See also the fragmentary hymn of Assurnaṣirpal I praising the king as hunter, which has the writing ba-ia-ru, Frahm 2009b, no. 77 l. 8.
Vs. 6 The use of the verb suhhunu meaning ‘to sharpen (a dagger)’ is unusual; AHw, vol. 2, 1004a suggests “to draw a dagger.” Royal inscriptions usually have šêlu in this context, s. Tigl. RIMA 2, A.0.87.1 I 36‒37 šatammu ṣīru ša dAššur kakkīšu ušaʾʾilu.
Vs. 7 Edzard 2004, 85 in his commentary on line 7 suggests that the unusual plene writing in i-iš-mu-ú is meant to symbolize the braying of the donkeys, but it seems that he is confusing spelling with actual utterance. Lambert, BWL, p. 328 called this an instance of Vorschlagsvokal and regarded it as common among Middle Assyrian scribes. Such unnecessary extra vowels in verbal prefixes occur already in Old Assyrian, see Hecker, GKT, pp. 36‒37, § 23d). For abnormal plene spellings see further Aro 1953.
Vs. 8 puluhtu kabtat generally occurs in affirmative clauses and not in negative constructions, as was observed by Edzard 2004, 85 in his commentary on l. 8.



470 Appendix
Vs. 10 According to Edzard 2004, 83 Vs. 10, Maul’s collation shows the sign /-ne/ after pu-hur.
Vs. 11 uzzubāni is the Assyrian form of the stative 1. Pl. of ezēbu D versus Babylonian uzzubānu, see v. Soden, GAG § 75b; Hecker, GKT § 72a, and Kouwenberg 2010, p. 180.
Vs. 12 i-ma-si-ri represents a sandhi-writing immāseri for ina mēseri “in the enclosure.”
Vs. 13 meaning according to CAD Š/2, 243 s.v. šāʾu uncertain; AHw vol. 3, 1205b has šāʾu II “laufen” D Stem, Standard Babylonian. Here I follow the suggestion of A. Salonen, Jagd und Jagdtiere im alten Mesopotamien, 1974, 44, who considers šāru to be the subject of the sentence with its final /-a/ representing an assonance intended by the author. The previous sandhi writing and other poetic features justify such a suggestion.
Vs. 14 The change of /-št-/ to /-lt-/ is typical of the Middle Assyrian dialect. The following verbal form ē lillika must be a vetitive as the speech of the donkeys continues to refer to the hunter. Edzard reads ši-˹da˺-at qa-al-ti-šú e li-illi-ka šá DA pu-hu-ru-ti with šiddu ‘length’ instead of šilûtu ‘bowshot’ and šá DA for šá ṭēhi “close by” following a suggestion by Michael Streck.
Vs. 15 ša būlu ... dabābu is an anticipatory genitive typical of poetic texts.
Vs. 16 šansukū is a Stative 3. pl.m. with Assyrian vocalization (Babylon.: šussukū). ṭēššunu exhibits consonantal assimilation: ṭēššunu < ṭēnšunu < ṭēnšunu. si-qi-ri-šu-nu = siqru is the Assyrian form corresponding to Babylonian zikru “utterance”.
Vs. 17 Edzard assumes a direct speech introduced by the particle mā instead of reading ma-a-〈la〉 at the beginning by analogy with what follows in the second half of the line. Edzard, however, cannot make sense of the line. Rather it seems that the speech of the hunter only starts with line 19. The reading /pi5/ for the sign NE and to assume the word pû “chaff” is problematic because it is attested only in Old Assyrian. To assume the reading bí-〈i〉 is equally difficult because the sign /bí-/ is so far not attested in the Genitive of pû.
Vs. 18 Foster 2005, 336 reads pu-tu linked with petû “to open” and translates “who will make breaches”. Note that D-stem of the verb is attested for the first time during Tiglath-Pileser I, see CAD P, 354 s.v. petû 6 i.
Vs. 19‒20 nillik and niqqi are forms of the cohortative i nillik and i niqqi as attested in Neo-Assyrian (GAG § 81g).



No. 1 LKA 62 471
Vs. 20 ikkakkīni is again a sandhi-writing for ina kakkīni. Although sahān dāmīšunu looks like a status constructus I prefer to connect it with kakku in analogy with line 6.
Rev. 23 šalaštu > mA/mB ša/elaltu is a feminine form of šalaš.
Rev. 24 With adu we have the Assyrian variant of Babylonian adi otherwise only attested in the Neo-Assyrian dialect.
Rev. 27 lazzammur is the Assyrian Precative of the Gtn stem (Babylonian: luzzammur), lītu is often paired with the noun danānu, mA/nA da’ānu in Assyrian royal inscriptions, thus literally: “let me sing the victory and the might of Assur.” At the end of the line Edzard prefers to follow Maul’s collation, which reads SAL without making sense of it. Note, however, that ṣūlātu (pl. t.) “battle” is used in poetic language.
Rev. 30 issatkana is the Assyrian Gt Perf. (GAG § 30g)
Orthography, Language, and Style
The text has many paleographic features, which are typical of Middle Assyrian: For instance BA, ZU, SU, RU, TU, LI, QU; the signs ŠA, RA are written with four horizontal wedges instead of three (see Cancik-Kirschbaum, BATSH 4, pp. 73‒87) Note the defective writing of double consonants, which is already typical of Old Assyrian writing, such as i-ka-pu-da for ikappuda (l. 5), ú-sa-hana for usahhana (l. 6), i-ma-ha-ru for imahharū (l. 9), ú-pa-ra-du for uparradū (l. 10), ki-pa-〈at〉 for kippat (l. 11), ki-pa-su!-ma for kippassuma (l. 13), ni-i-li-ik for nillik (l. 19), i-ka-ki-i-ni-i for ina kakkīni (l. 20).
Furthermore, the writings siqru for Babylonian zikru and izaqqar for izakkar also constitute Assyrian features (see, for instance, Luukko, SAAS 16, pp. 75‒76). Several phonological features are known primarily from Neo-Assyrian texts, such as the insertion of the anatyptic or epenthetic vowel into a consonant cluster, vowel harmony, full assimilation, and “overhanging” vowels. These features probably account for von Soden’s late dating of this composition in his Akkadische Handwörterbuch. Phonological features such as the –ltfor –št-, however, in addition to the clearly Middle Assyrian paleography, suggest a Middle Assyrian date; perhaps one should date the text towards the end of the Middle Assyrian period. This date finds further support in the occurrence of words that are otherwise attested only in literary texts, such as šagaštu/šagaltu and ṣūlātu, as well



472 Appendix
as the expression puhādi lapātu, which is reminiscent of the Sumerian term lú.máš.šu.gíd designating the profession of the haruspex, and combination of words that seem unattested elsewhere such as illat kibrāti and [lāʾi]ṭ ayyābi. Some lexems are clearly Assyrian, such as adu for adi and siqru for zikru. The writing izaqqar represents a mixed form with both Babylonian and Assyrian features. The choice of the vowel in illatu constitutes likewise a Babylonian writing rather than Assyrian ellatu. Furthermore, the vocalization of the Stative šansuku / Babylonian šassuku and the Precatives lazzamur and lušanni, and the otherwise Neo-Assyrian form of the Cohortative, which uses only the Preterite without the particle i are additional Assyrian dialectal features, although the latter might also occur in early Standard Babylonian texts, see GAG § 81g. In contrast to another poetic Middle Assyrian text ascribed to Tiglath-Pileser I, LKA 63, this composition has only one form of the hymnic-epic dialect, which is karmiš (rev. 6).
Thematic and Poetic Structure of the Text
LKA 62 can be divided into five strophes or stanzas, which thematically deal with the following subjects: 1. Introduction of the hunter and his plan to hunt down the donkeys 2. The recalcitrant donkeys 3. The king’s reaction and performance of extispicy 4. The military campaign and the defeat of the enemy 5. The praise of the god Assur
These strophes can be further subdivided in hemistichs, monostichs, couplets, triplets and quatrains. This is supported by grammatical, syntactic and phonological elements, as well as the use of alliterations and assonances. The convergence of content and poetics justifies treating them together. The first strophe consists of the first six verses and can be subdivided into three couplets. The first couplet describes the hunter and follows a parallel structure predicated on the sequence of four participles [lāʾiṭ, dāʾiš, [nāʾir] and dālihi, each one subdividing the verse into two hemistichs. The following two verses are also part of the titulary, which proceeds with details concerning the divine support for the king. Both verses are nominal sentences: the first one plays with the assonance of /a/ and /u/, while the second one is marked by the repetition of the vowels /a/ and /i/. Lines 3 and 4 consist of synonyms given in parallel constructions: in line 4, ālik pānīšu is complemented by ašarēd ilāni thus constituting the climax of the verse. This



No. 1 LKA 62 473
epithet of Ninurta is also attested in LKA 63 rev. 8. This climax is stressed by placing the name of the god Ninurta at the end of the sentence. Lines 5 and 6 form also a couplet introducing an opposition between the hunter and the donkeys, marked by the repetition of the vowels /a/ and /u/ for the hunter (bayyāru ... ikappuda qabla / usahhana pataršu) and the repetition of the vowels /a/ and /i/ for the donkeys (ana imērī / ana qīt napištīšunu). These alliterations would emphasize their hostile encounter by means of the sound. Both verses are syntactically parallel with regard to the position of the verb, which is placed at the beginning of the verse and show similarities with LKA 63:
LKA 62 : 5‒6 ikappuda qabl[u] ana qīt napištīšunu usahhana pataršu.
LKA 63 : 6′‒8′ ikpudu ... tuqumta ... išēlū kakkēšunu.
Note, however, that the pairing of “sound” and “meaning” in this fashion has been challenged by some scholars, who regard it as based on the so-called enactment fallacy; see Barry 1980 and Terry 1999. The positioning of the object qablu ‘battle’ and pataršu ‘his dagger’ steers the reader’s or auditor’s attention toward the imminent event of the hunt, i.e. the battle. Further stylistic features of the first strophe show in various forms of parallelism. The lines 1‒2 each have two couplets with a parallelismus membrorum. The second verse (l. 2) in addition offers an antithetical parallelism by introducing the contrast between mountain and steppe, which continues in a parallelism with line 1. Both verses further introduce the parallelism of hunt and war as it is negotiated in great detail in the royal inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser I. While in the first couplets of the strophe the motives of war and hunt are clearly separated, they completely merge in the third and last couplet of the strophe by means of the juxtaposition of the lexemes bayyāru and qablu. The following second strophe includes 8 verses (ll. 7‒17) and describes the recalcitrant donkeys who resist the subjugation. This motif compares with the insurrection and rebellion as described in LKA 63: 17′‒18′. The exact structuring of the strophe is complicated as the direct speech of the donkeys starts in the midst of line 9 continuing until line 14. The second half of the strophe divides clearly into two couplets ll. 11‒12 and 13‒14. The couplet ll. 11‒12 is formed by the chiastic positioning of the statives uzzubāni and rāmat as well by the parallelismus membrorum of ina kippat šadî and immāseri ša šadê. The analysis of the four first verses of the second strophe (ll. 7‒10) is difficult as verse 9 starts with the direct speech in its second hemistich; on the other hand the lines 7 and 10 have both two hemistichs forming a framework based on the syntactic parallelism.



474 Appendix
The third strophe describing the king’s reaction toward the recalcitrant donkeys has equally eight verses, which divide into one quatrains and two couplets. The quatrains is built after the model ABBA, whereby the verses 15 and 18 can be read as one sentence, which, in addition, shows a synonym parallelism in the use of the verbs dabābu and zaqāru. Line 15 stresses the speech of the donkeys by means of its anticipatory genitive. The verses 16 and 17 with two completely parallel hemistichs form an insertion into this sentence. Both hemistichs further use synonymous statives with their use of mala form a chiasm. The following couplet contains the response of the king. Both verses 1920 form a syntactic unity with their use of the anticipatory genitive and the three cohortatives nillik, niškun, and niqqi. And again our text compares with LKA 63 by the use of rebellius speech, the plan to kill the enemy and its realization (see LKA 63: 19′ and 24′ šagaš nakrē and hulluq nakrē ūšâ šaptēšu).
Similar to the first strophe, the following fourth strophe consists of six verses accounting the battle and subsequent destruction of the enemy. The text has now left the context of the fable moving into human reality with the description of the treatment of pregnant women and babies. The two announcements of the time šelalti ūmē and adu la Šamaš characterize the verses 23 and 24 as couplet. Likewise the two following verses form a unity based on the Tricolon ušerriṭi, unappil, and unakkis as well as on the antithesis lakūti // dannūti. The poetical structure of lines 27 and 28 is disputable. On the one hand one could consider them as a unity based on their images of the ‘smoke’ (quturu) and ‘like a ruin’ (karmiš). On the other hand one could consider line 27 as the concluding verse of the battle account with verse 6 forming the theological quintessence acting as transition towards the Abgesang, the praise to the god Assur. The last part consists of three verses, ll. 29‒31; with regard to its content it is reminiscent of the introduction to the Anzû Myth representing a praise to the warrior god Ninurta, and further the incipits of the gangiṭṭu-songs in the song catalogue KAR 158 rev. V 12‒14 (Hecker, TUAT NF vol. 7, 54‒63) as well as of LKA 64, a heroic poem of Assurnaṣirpal I. The pair of the words mahru arku in the context of transmission will occur again in the Abgesang of Enuma elish VII 157‒158 tak-l[im-tú] mah-r[u-ú i]d-bubu pa-nu!-uš-šu // išṭur-ma iš-t[a]-kan ana ši-mé-e ar-ku-ti “The revelation (of the names), which is the first one spoken before him (Marduk), he wrote down and established (it) for posterity to hear.” Hurowitz and Westenholz have already collected the parallels of LKA 62 with the hunting reports in the annals of Tiglath-Pileser I, which I would like to reprint here referring to RIMA 2 for the sake of completeness:

LKA 62 : 2 dālihi būlu ṣēri // mugammer muʾʾur ṣēri (RIMA 2, A.0.87.1 vi 57),

LKA 62 : 11 ina kippat šadî šaqūte // ina qereb huršāni šaqūte (RIMA 2, A.0.87.1 vii 8‒9).
The previous analysis allows for the following structuring of the text:
Strophe Lines Poetical Unit Theme
I 1‒ 2 couplet Introduction of the hunter 3‒ 4 couplet Divine support 5‒ 6 couplet Preparation of the hunt II 7‒10 quatrain The recalcitrant donkeys 11‒12 couplet Their notion of security 13‒14 couplet Their contempt for the hunter III 15‒18 quatrain Reaction of the hunter 19‒20 couplet His speech to his soldiers 21‒22 couplet Performance of extispicy IV 1‒ 2 couplet Military campaign 3‒ 4 couplet (Tricolon) Destruction of the enemy 5 monostich Complete wipe-out 6 monostich Theological quintessence V 7‒ 9 triplet (Abgesang) Praise to Assur
The comparison between the poetic texts and the historiographic texts allows for an insight into Assyrian poetics. Here the encounter of the acting parties is presented an a dramatic way, as the enemy is represented as an active counterpart who acts and speaks thus having a profile of his own in contrast to the Assyrian royal inscriptions, which tend to draw the enemy as completely passive entity. The enemy and the Assyrian king appear as equal partners. The use of imagery such as the one of the hunter sharpening his dagger to cut the throat of the victim enforces the poetic character of the text. The use of the motive of the inquiry into the oracles attested in later NeoAssyrian royal inscriptions is not yet part of the Middle Assyrian ones but represents an intertextual link with the Tukulti-Ninurta I Epic (iii = A obv. 41′ ff.) and perhaps the Cuthean Legend. Tiglath-Pileser I only goes into battle after the gods have indicated to him the propitious time. Owing to divine consent the king can count on his success within no time, a motif already negotiated in the Sumerian poem of the Curse of Akkad as well as the Cuthean Legend determining whether the king will enter cultural memory in a positive or negative way (as Heils- or Unheilsherrscher).
