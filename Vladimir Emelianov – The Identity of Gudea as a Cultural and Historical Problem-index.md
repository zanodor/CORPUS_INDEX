The Identity of Gudea as a Cultural and Historical Problem
Vladimir Emelianov
Abstract
The article is devoted to the study of the personality and identity of Gudea, who was the ruler of the Sumerian city of Lagash. The influence of the age of Gudea on Mesopotamia and increasingly on the culture of the Middle East cannot be overestimated. Gudea was the first Sumerian ruler who submitted cult life to writing. For the first time the ruler was depicted realistically and in a large sculpture. All Sumerian hymns, except the temple hymns, go back to the texts of Gudea, as does the significance of the cult of Bilgames for state ideology. The article examines the origins and status of Gudea and considers the three versions of the chronology of his reign. The author suggests that Gudea and his father-in-law Ur-Bau were the offspring of a sacred marriage, Gudea had the status of the city god and the prophet of Ningirsu, and that Gudea ruled during the time of the Gutean leader Yarlagan.
In the famous Swiss series of volumes on the history of Mesopotamia, there is no separate section on the Second dynasty of Lagash. Immediately after the
Sargonic period the Ur III dynasty followed.1 Such a gap in the systematic study of history is hardly accidental. We still cannot set the time and date of this dynasty. What is known is that it may be situated after the period of Akkade and
close to the era of Ur III.2 The most famous historical figure of this period was
the ensi Gudea, who ruled in Lagash for about 20 years.3 However, we do not know his genesis and the time of his reign. The influence of the age of Gudea on the subsequent history of Mesopotamia and on the whole culture of the Middle East cannot be overestimated:
1 Sallaberger–Westenholz 1999. 2 There are three main versions of the Gutean chronology: 40 years (W.W. Hallo), 100 years (P. Steinkeller), 80 years (W. Sallaberger). All dates are counted from the end of the reign of the Akkadian king Sharkalisharri to the first years of Ur-Nammu (22nd–21st centuries BC). On the duration of the reign of Lagash II until now nothing can be said. Moreover, some researchers believe that those rulers who decided to unite in one continuous dynasty, could have belonged to different families. It is estimated that the reign of Lagash II covered 4 to 5 generations (Sallaberger–Schrakamp 2015: 113–130). 3 Edzard 1997.

1. Gudea was the first Sumerian ruler who recorded the circumstances of cult life in writing. Before him, the religious texts were fragmentary and often
written in encrypted cuneiform (so called ‘UD. GAL.NUN – orthography’).4
2. For the first time a ruler was depicted realistically and in a large sculpture.5 3. For the first time a statue had an inscription concerning the ruler and set in a place of remembrance, speaking on behalf of the governor about his edifices
and religious activities.6 4. Gudea was the first to put the religious category ME (magic forces, rites,
predestination) at the centre of religious and political ideology.7
5. Gude was the first who made Bilgames his friend ([d]/ Bilgames \-da mu2-a “grown with Bilgames” (Cyl. B XXIII 19) and proclaimed the mother of Bil
games – the goddess Ninsu(mu) – to be his own mother (B XXIII 16).8 This
indicates an obsession of Gudea with the idea of immortality.9 6. All Sumerian hymns, except the temple hymns, go back to the texts of Gu
dea,10 as well as the cult of Bilgames in future state ideology. 7. Gudea was the first ruler after the legendary Bilgames who was revered in the era of Ur III as a god and had several days given for worship. He was depicted on the seals of the nobles, and the name of Gudea on seals preceded
by the determinative DINGIR “god”.11 Gudea is a very strange name. Its equivalent is the Akkadian nabi'um “(one who) called” (in other Semitic languages nabi “prophet”): gu3.de2.a = na-bu
4 The first temple hymns were created in the Early Dynastic period in Abu Salabih (25th century BC). However, only Gudea moved the process of construction and the ritual consecration of the temple to cuneiform script. 5 On the famous diorite stele dedicated to the victory of Naram-Suen over Lullubi, the ruler is depicted conventionally. We do not know details of his face. Similarly, conventional is the image of Ur-Nanshe on plaquette. Realistic images in Mesopotamian art begin only with the Gudea statues. 6 Strictly speaking, the first statue with the inscription contains the name of Ur-Bau (Edzard 1997: 18–19). But D.O. Edzard noted the coincidence of its style with the style of Gudea statues rather than the inscriptions of Ur-Bau (Edzard 1997: 15). It is possible that a statue of Ur-Bau was installed by Gudea in honour of his predecessor. 7 Emelianov 2009: 89–107. 8 Edzard 1997: 100. 9 In the final part of the Sumerian epic Lugale hero Ninurta blesses the diorite, saying that “king, who ‘sets’ his name for long days” will use it for his statues (Edzard 1997: 26). Researchers of the epic agree that this king was Gudea, because his statues were created mainly of diorite. 10 Klein 1989. 11 Suter 2013.



The Identity of Gudea 65
um (Kagal E 3 I 7; AHw, N/2 699–700).12 Full name might be sipa dNin-gir2
su-ke4 gu3-de2-a “shepherd, called by (god) Ningirsu” (B VI 17).13
The texts of Gudea do not mention his earthly parents, nor an earthly king to whom he served. The only king mentioned is the main god of Lagash Ningirsu. According to the ‘List of the Rulers of Lagash’, Gudea has the status Gu3-de2-a
šeš-ban3-da-Ur-dBa-U2-/ ka \ [...] dumu ama-na dumu ad-da nu-me-a “the younger brother of Ur-Bau [...], who was not the son of his mother nor the son of his father” (i.e. ‘who did not have a father and mother’, which is consistent
with the statue inscriptions and cylinders) (lines 198–199).14 In turn, his father
in-law Ur-Bau named himself in his inscriptions “child born by Ninagal”,15 and
in the list of Lagash rulers he is called “scribe of Ur-Ningirsu” (lines 196).16 This means that Ur-Bau also had no earthly parents. We can assume that Lagash was ruled over two generations by offspring of a sacred marriage, one of whom brought up the other as a younger brother. There is some evidence in favour of the deification of Gudea during his lifetime. First, there is an epithet in an inscription on the cylinder B Gudea “ensi,
the god of his city” (Cyl. B I 15: ensi2-ke4 dingir-iri-na-ke4)17, son of (dumu) Ningishzida (B XXIV 7) and mother-goddess (ama-dingir) Gatumdug (B XXIII
19).18 It means that he is an absolute god – for both parents (unlike Bilgames).19
12 See also epithet of Hammurapi: gu3.de2.a.an.na = Nabi’u-AN “called by Anum” (CAD N/1, 31). 13 Edzard: 1997: 92. On Gudea's mission as the prophet of Ningirsu indicates not only his name, but the episode of incubation and sacred sleep in the temple. The Cyl. A described his vision of a tetramorph creature rising from Earth to Heaven (See later the tetramorph of Ezekiel in the Bible and the image of Gabriel in the “Life of Muhammad” by HishamEmelianov 2001). 14 Gudea addresses the goddess Gatumdug and calls her his father and his mother, saying that he has neither father nor mother. Then it is said that Gatumdug took Gudea as a seed and bore him in the sanctuary: ama nu-tuku-me ama-gu10 ze2-me / a nu-tuku-me a-gu10 ze2-me / a-gu10 ša3-ga šu ba-ni-du11 unu6-a i3-tud-e “mother I do not have – you’re my mother! Father I do not have – you're my father! My seed took you there, in the sanctuary you gave birth to me” (Cyl. A III 6–8; Edzard 1997: 70). 15 Perhaps Ninegal (a2 < e2) who is Inanna of the Nether World (Selz 1995: 218; Behrens 1998). See Edzard 1997: 15. C.E. Suter rightly observes that filiation is not characteristic for the Lagash II inscriptions (Suter 2000: 15). 16 Sollberger 1967; ETCSL 2.1.2 17 This can hardly be compare with the official title of Naram-Suen il Akkade “god of Akkade” (as done by Edzard 1997: 26), since the determinative DINGIR “god” was never used before Gudea’s name during his lifetime, and his status was not equal to that of Naram-Suen. 18 Edzard, 1997: 100–101. 19 At the same time Gudea did not understand what Ningirsu wanted from him. To clarify the meaning of the god’s words, he turned to the interpreter of dreams, the goddess Nan

Second, in the last part of statue F Gudea ordered sheep, asses, oxen, goats and donkeys to be fruitful and multiply, and then placed shepherds over them, something that normally only the gods, especially Enki, can do.

she, whom he calls his sister (nin9). This means that, although Gudea is related to the gods, he does not speak their language. 20 Edzard 1997: 48. 21 A similar transfer of livestock is found in one inscription of Enanatum I (En. I 12), but there we have the delivery of goats, cows, donkeys and their cubs to the temple of Amageshtinana. The inscription does not contain commands to breed (Frayne 2008: 184185).

When Nudimmud goes forth to the good pregnant ewes, good lambs will be born; when he goes forth to the fecund cows, good calves will be born; when he goes forth to the good pregnant goats, good kids will be born. If you go forth to the cultivated fields, to the good germinating fields, stockpiles
and stacks can be accumulated on the high plain.22
Gudea commanded livestock to multiply immediately after laying the foundation of the temple of his mother Gatumdug and watering of the temple brick with fragrant oil. That is, for the successful building of the temple it was necessary to accompany its erection with reproduction of living beings. Third, in the inscription on the statue R one can read about the rite of opening the mouth (ka-du8) of the statue of Gudea. This ceremony was held only for
the statues of the gods.23

22 Benito 1969; ETCSL 1.1.3. 23 Walker–Dick 2001. 24 Steible 1991: 243. 25 We know Gudea’s personal stamp on which his personal god Ningishzida brings the ruler of Lagash to god Enki holding vessels in two hands, of which numerous other vessels cascade water. The same streams pouring from the vessel can be seen on the statue N of Gudea. What does it mean? Since for the inhabitants of ancient Mesopotamia bilingual thinking was typical, then homophones (Akkad. mê “water” and the Sumerian me “force of life”) could serve as a basis for the image of forces ME as the water coming from the Abzu. In cuneiform texts it can be seen in the form of writing Akkadian word for ME through Sumerian ideogram for water: ušār ana mātija me-e (var. A.MEŠ) ili nayāri “I went to my country to follow the rituals of the gods” (CAD M/2, 156).

She adorned Gudea with all her precious divine powers. The shepherd chosen by her in her holy heart, Gudea, the ruler of Lagaš, placed the lyre (?) Cow-of-Abundance among the tigi drums and placed the holy balaĝ drum at its side. While sacred songs and harmonious songs were performed before her, the kintur instrument praised the temple. The chief musician played the ibex horn for her: the song ‘The house has been granted powers from the Abzu’, the sacred song of the house of Sirara about the princely powers was per
formed.26
The vital question for historians remains the date of the reign of Gudea. Currently, there are three basic versions of his time. Version I. V. K. Šilejco wrote at the beginning of the last century that the dynasty of Akkade was destroyed not by the kings of the second dynasty of Uruk (as E. Meier thought), but by the invasion of Guteans, who then subjugated the entire country. He comes to this conclusion on the basis of several economic texts, which speak of delivering large loads to a certain king in the era of Gudea. Šilejco correlated this message with inscriptions of Gudea, which stated his authority over the territory formerly ruled by Akkade, and with dating of one economic tablet by the year of the destruction of Uruk. After paleographic analysis of recorded texts, he made the final conclusion: Gudea ruled after the destruction of Akkade; the second dynasty of Uruk was in this era of secondary importance and was often subjected to attacks from the outside; the goods which were delivered in the time of Gudea to an unknown king was nothing more than
a tribute to the Gutean conquerors of Sumer, titling themselves kings (lugal).27 The opinion of Šilejco became dominant, and the middle chronology dates the time of Gudea to approximately 2143–2123 BC. However, reading the texts Šilejco referenced (AO 3422, AO 3426, AO 3433), we see that the name of the king in the texts is not specified. They do not have the name of Gudea. And
26 Heimpel 1981; ETCSL 4.14.1 27 Šilejco 1915: XXIX–XXXIV.



The Identity of Gudea 69
finally, paleographic traits allow dating these texts to the end of the Akkade
dynasty.28 Version II. In the texts of the extradition of clothing officials Bazigi, Urga, Lugal-egide, Ur-Nigar and Ur-Eshlila are mentioned. They served Gudea until
his 8th year, then Ur-Namma from the 15th year and Shulgi until his 11th year. From this fact P. Steinkeller concluded the synchronism between the time of Gudea in Lagash and the first years of Ur-Namma in Ur (circa 2113–2093
BC).29 W. Sallaberger wrote: “Da Gudea in seinen Zeugnissen nicht über militärische oder politische Taten berichtet, fällt seine Einordnung überaus schwer. P. Steinkeller ... konnte durch eine prosopographische Analyse von Urkunden zeigen, dass er nämlich nicht sehr weit von Šulgis frühen Jahren entfernt sein
darf.”30 Recently Steinkeller’s version was criticized by the same W. Sallaberger and J. Schrakamp on the evidence of prosopography from the economic texts. They have established that the said officials did not live in Gudea’s time, but later – under the rule of the son of Gudea Ur-Ningirsu, ensi Nammahni and
Shulgi of Ur.31 Version III. In the Old Babylonian period Gudea was believed to have been a subordinate of Shulgi (c. 2093–2046), and the priesthood continued to make offerings to diorite statues erected by his order. This was inscribed on a sixcolumn tablet from the collection of Martin Schøyen. The writing on it is typical for the time of Rim-Sin, the king of Larsa (c. 1822–1763). No transliteration of this text exists yet. I translate the text, combining the initial reconstruction of C.
Wilcke and further additions by Wilcke and U. Gabbay.32
28 The problem of dating is also connected with a large number of namesakes. For example, in his recent article G. Visicato followed the career of a bureaucrat named UrBagara, who served in Girsu from the time of Sharkalisharri until Gudea. From his observations, he concluded that the distance between the end of the Akkadian dynasty and Ur-Namma’s time was relatively short (35 or 40 years) (Visicato 2010). However, if we look at the document CFC 124 = AAS 180 from Girsu, we see the same Ur-Bagara living during the reign of Ibbi-Suen (that is, he must have lived more than 100 years, because the Ur III kings ruled during about a century) (Grégoire 1970). This would be obviously a nonsense, which gives us every reason to believe that there were several officials who had the name Ur-Bagara in Girsu during the period from Sharkalisharri to Ibbi-Suen. 29 Steinkeller 1988: 50–51. 30 Sallaberger 1999: 133. 31 Sallaberger–Schrakamp 2015: 122. A. di Ludovico who made a full list of publications concerning the date of Gudea wrote in conclusion: “Of recent date are the attempts of reconstructing the history of Lower Mesopotamia in the years of the reign of Gudea on the bases of the beliefs that this ruler has to be considered a contemporary of Ur-Namma and Puzur-Inšušinak, the last member of the Dynasty of Awan... However, problems related to the interpretation of the available data and to the estimation of the length of the reign of each ruler are still far to be solved” (Di Ludovico 2008: 322, n. 12). 32 Wilcke 2011: 29–47; Wilcke–Gabbay 2012: 98–99.

From Dilmun, Marhashi Carnelian I brought, Diorite Statues I created. These statues are 537. In Eninnu, In the house of Ningirsu, I made them.
Column V lists the regular offerings to diorite statues of Gudea: bread, beer, broth, melted butter (1 litre) and kukku-pies (1/2 litre). At the end of the text there is a general formula: “Total 537 of them.” Column VI contains only a few signs in the two lines (4 and 5). The first column of text is badly damaged. The name of Shulgi was restored by C.Wilcke from the epithet dingir-kalam-ma “god of the country,” which is
known only from the inscriptions of the 35th year of Shulgi. The name Gudea is reconstructed not only from broken characters of line 12, but also from the use
of the epithet ma2-gid2-dEn-lil2-la2 “boat-bearer of Enlil”, which is inherent only
to Gudea.33 Wilke accepts the evidence of the inscription as being correct. According to his hypothesis, Gudea could have obtained the position of the ruler of Lagash several years after the victory of Ur-Namma over Elam. Inasmuch as this victory took place in the first year of the reign of Ur-Namma, Gudea could have lived to
the beginning of the reign of his son Shulgi.34 C.E. Suter does not agree with this. From her point of view, the 537 statues of Gudea in the text are most likely a parody and satire, which appeared on the walls of the Old Babylonian scribe
school of Larsa in the era of Rim-Sin.35 To solve the problem of Gudea chronology, we will analyse the genealogy listed in the royal inscriptions.
Ur-Bau, the younger brother of Gudea, had three daughters: • Enanepada, priestess of Ur • Ninalla, spouse of Gudea • Ninhedu, spouse of Nammahni
33 Wilcke 2011: 42. 34 Wilcke 2011: 37. 35 Suter 2012: 59. Another dubious claim is the statement on legitimation of Gudea in Nippur, never mentioned in his own inscriptions.

lugal-Gu-ti-um-kam39 was the king of Guteans.
This evidence allows following conclusions:
1. Gudea and Nammahni married the daughters of Ur-Bau Ninalla and Ninhedu. So they were contemporaries, and perhaps of roughly the same age. 2. When Gudea was ensi of Lagash, Nammahni at the same time was ensi of Umma. He came to power after the son of Gudea Ur-Ningirsu and the three ensi ruling after him. 3. When Gudea and Nammahni were ensi respectively of Lagash and Umma, the king (lugal) was the Gutean leader Yarlagan(da). According to the ‘Sumerian King List’, Yarlagan(da) ruled for 7 years, before Si’u (also 7) and Tirigan (4
years).40 Tirigan was a contemporary of Utuhengal and Ur-Namma who defeated him during the battle. Thus, Gudea was not Ur-Namma’s contemporary.
Additionally, one can pay attention to the lines 75–78 of the prologue to the UrNamma Laws. There are two versions of the translation:
He killed (he2-mi-ug5) Namhani, ensi of Lagash.41
He raised to power (he2-mi-il2) Namhani, ensi of Lagash.42
Regardless of the fact what Ur-Namma did with Namhani / Nammahni, they were contemporaries. If Ur-Namma obliged Namhani his position of ensi, then Ur-Namma cannot be a contemporary of Gudea. The same holds true if UrNamma killed Namhani.
38 According to genealogical investigations of C.F. Monaco, Nammahni of Lagash and Nammahni of Umma is the same ruler (Monaco 1990: 97–98). But Namhani of Lagash in the Law Code of Ur-Namma is a different person from Nammahni in the Lagash inscriptions (Monaco 1990: 100; Flückiger-Hawker 1999: 3–4). However, neither of these opinions confirm with the strict textual evidence. 39 Frayne 1993: 267. 40 ETCSL 2.2.1, lines 327–329. 41 Kramer–Falkenstein 1954: 45. 42 Frayne 1997: 47.



74 Vladimir Emelianov
To summarize the known data, we can say the following:
1. It is possible that there was some kind of solidarity of children born as a result of a sacred marriage in Sumer. Judging from the inscriptions of Ur-Bau, this ruler was considered the son of the goddess Ninegal, and his earthly parents were never mentioned. It is possible that Ur-Bau approved the marriage of Gudea and his daughter Ninalla because of the divine origin of Gudea. Mentioning of Gudea as a child of Ninsun who grew up with Bilgames adds another argument to this idea. 2. The sources of Gudea do not mention the name of his earthly master. Moreover, he considered only Ningirsu to be his king. 3. The inscriptions of Gudea never specify his direct connection with Guteans. An Old Babylonian source connected him with the Ur III dynasty king Shulgi. 4. Data of votive inscriptions and the Code of Ur-Namma witness in favour of the fact that Gudea lived under Guteans, including Yarlagan. 5. The status of Gudea is difficult to determine. He was a god of Lagash, but lower than Ningirsu in status. His name is unique and means the position of the prophet of Ningirsu. He had only divine parents, and he named two mothers: Gatumdug and Ninsun. 6. Monuments of art naming Nanshe as a sister of Gudea showed that Gudea was related to the cult of Enki and rites of Abzu. 7. There is not much doubt that the prophetic literature of the Middle East begins with the texts of Gudea.
