Cylinder seal impression. A carved stone cylinder was rolled across a
wet clay tablet to form an official, individualized seal. This one shows the
winged goddess Inanna standing above the sun god Utu as he rises, using
a saw to cut his way through the mountains. To her left is an unidentified
hunter/warrior god. To her right is Enki, the god of the Abzu (the
underground water table) surrounded by water and fish. Beside him is
Isimud, his two-faced minister. The writing in the background identifies
the seal as belonging to Adda, a scribe. Click to enlarge.

Cylinder seal, and the impression it makes when rolled across wet
clay. The manufacture of cylinder seals was a highly regarded art form in
ancient Sumer. The engravers had to carve the hard cylinder stones using
only simple tools. The images and lettering had to be carved
in both spatial and photographic reverse, so that they would be raised
from the surface and facing in the right direction.
Cylinder seal impression of a royal ostrich hunting scene. This seal is
from a later period. The look on the ostrich's face is priceless. Enlarge.

A cylinder seal impression showing Enki and other gods. Enki is on the
right. The gods are recognizable by their horned helmets. Note the
"birdman" in the center. He is being led in a neck stock, his hands tied, to
stand before the judgment of Enki. Click to enlarge. This story is also seen
on another cylinder seal impression.
Inanna, the goddess of love and war, with a lion. No other image of
Inanna better illustrates her dual nature. She is depicted as a goddess of
love, "showing some leg"; while the lion and the weapons of battle (maces)
seen rising up behind her shows that she is also the goddess of war. In all
of ancient mythology, no other deity is the goddess of love and war

combined. The eight-pointed star (Venus) is another symbol associated
with Inanna. This image is in photographic reverse. See the complete seal
impression. Also see a line-drawing of the seal by S. Beaulieu.
Although she is called the goddess of love, Inanna is really the goddess of
lust. She is not associated with romance, marriage, fertility or child
bearing. She is so extreme in her emotions, so psychotic in her desires,
and so relentless in getting what she wants, she thus symbolizes the
violence of human passion. This is why she is also represents the
destruction and carnage of war.

Copper goat head from the city of Shuruppak. The triangular mark on
the goat’s head also appears on a bull’s head, a different goat statue, and
on many other Sumerian works of art. The meaning of the symbol isn’t
known. It’s been suggested that the triangle symbolizes divinity because
the mark most often appears on animal statues found at temple sites, but
it probably means the animal is "sacred" rather than being an actual
deity because the Sumerians didn’t worship animal gods. I would suggest
the triangle means the animal is intended for sacrifice. Throughout the
ancient world, animals were sometimes “garlanded for the sacrifice” or
otherwise decorated for the sacrificial ceremonies, like the aproned
animals in the victory procession on the Standard of Ur. These decorations
often included an adornment for the animal’s head, as shown in a modern
Greek reenactment of an animal sacrifice, and in depictions of Roman
sacrificial ceremonies.

high resolution photo of the sledge can be found in The Royal Tombs of
Ur: Exploration.
Artist reconstruction of the ziggurat at Ur: Because of the scarcity
of timber in Sumer, only the external bricks of a ziggurat were kiln-fired
and therefore waterproof. The interiors of the walls were filled with clay
and sun-dried bricks.

world's first depictions of modern soldiers and modern organized
warfare. In both panels, Eannatum (on foot, and in a chariot) leads his
soldiers to war. These are indeed soldiers, not just warriors, but soldiers in
the modern sense of the word. Every man is "in uniform",
identically armed and equipped as supplied by the state, rather than each
man bringing his own weapons to the battle, as occurs in tribal warfare.
The soldiers attack in a tight disciplined formation, with many men acting
as a single unit, as they advance to victory over the bodies of their
enemies. This isn't the disorganized mob of individual combatants that is
typical of the more primitive forms of warfare. These soldiers
are professionals.
Circa 2400 B.C. Enlarge.
The aftermath of battle: A king, wearing a shepherd's hat and holding
a shepherd's crook, stands with his foot astride a cringing prisoner of war.
The king receives the blessings of Ishtar, the goddess of war, who holds a
prisoner at the end of a rope. The lower register shows the captives being
"herded" into slavery. This image is sometimes mistaken to be a
Sumerian king, but it is actually an Akkadian king, since he wears the

short skirt that is typically worn by the people of this region. On the other
hand, the stylized shepherd's hat was worn as a crown by the
Sumerian, Akkadian, and Babylonian kings. Enlarge. A different
version of the drawing shows the king with a battleaxe instead of a
shepherd's crook.
Sargon the Great, the Akkadian king who conquered Sumer in 2350
B.C. There has been some speculation that it is actually Naram-Sin,
Sargon's grandson. I would suggest, however, that it really is Sargon
because of the unmistakable resemblance to the depiction of Sargon
on his Victory Stele.

modern sense of the word. Instead they used donkeys, as seen on the
post above. The donkeys were not very large; this is the reason why
four of them were needed to pull a war chariot.

Wall mural from the Babylonian city of Mari showing the home of the
gods. In the top panel is an unidentified god; possibly An, the god of
heaven, or Utu, the god of the sun. On the upper right is a winged
bullman.
Bottom panel: Enlil, the chief god of earth, is attended by a minor
female goddess (shown wearing a horned helmet) and by
two kings wearing shepherds' hats. Wind pours out of a jar, signifying that
Enlil is the god of the winds that bring life-giving rains. The first of the two
kings symbolically waters The Tree of Life (it's a rather scrawny
looking Tree of Life, in my opinion; see Ur-Namma and Enlil,
below). Note the bull on the left and the celestial figure on the right.
