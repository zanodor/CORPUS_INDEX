The spiritual world created by the ancient Egyptians was a richly fascinating one which remains unique in the history of human religion. The character of that spiritual world was both mysterious and manifest, at once accessible and hidden, for although Egyptian religion was often shrouded in layers of myth and ritual it nevertheless permeated t.he ancient civilization of the Nile and ultimately shaped, sustained

and directed Egyptian culture in almost every imaginable way. The deities of Egypt were present in the lives of pharaohs and citizens alike, creating a more completely theocratic society than any other of the ancient world. The truth behind Herodotus' statement that 'the Egyptians are more religious than any other people' is thus a broad one. encompassing literally hundreds of gods and goddesses, temples seemingly without end, and a mythology which was surpassing in its richness and complexity. Like the members of any other human culture the ancient Egyptians were driven to find meaning in existence, but for them this goal was attained in theological ideas which posited a myriad gods that were believed to have created the world and to be involved in every aspect of its existence and continuance. The number of deities worshipped by the ancient Egyptians was indeed staggering, and almost 1,500 gods and goddesses are known by name, though fewer are known in detail. To the modern viewer this panoply of seemingly countless deities - including anirnal, human, hybrid and composite forms - with their kaleidoscopic symbols and attributes often appears strange and confusing at best and quite unintelligible at worst. Yet closer examination reveals a world of interacting gods and goddesses whose myths and representations weave an amazing tapestry, often of unexpected intellectual and artistic sophistication.



r evidence for these deities is both ancient and -~i\·e. con1prising textual, architectural, repre

their later derivative texts, provide us with invaluable, if sometimes cryptic, evidence of the rich theological milieu of the ancient Egyptians. 1'hrough the various sources at our disposal we know that some of Egypt's deities originated before the beginning of recorded time and survived to the very end of the ancient world - having been worshipped for fully three-fifths of recorded human history. Even when they were eventually replaced by later faiths, the gods of Egypt sometimes found new life, and their influence has persisted in many and remarkable ways - ranging from apparent precursors of minor religious motifs and stories to perhaps even the concept of monotheism itself.

Chronology of the Rulers
The precise dates of the Egyptian dynasties and of individual reigns are still the subject of much scholarly debate. The dates employed here are based largely on the chronology developed by Professor John Baines and Dr Jaromir Malek and put forward in their
Atlas of Ancient Egypt. The so-called Amarna Period enco1npasses the reigns of Akhenaten, Tutankhamun and Ay in the 18th dynasty, Only the rulers discussed
in the text are listed here.
But 111 ancient times, for the Egyptians then1selves, the gods were far more than the sum of all their myths and images. The monuments and artifacts which have survived give only glimpses of the great power of the Egyptian gods. While they lived in the n1inds of the ancient Egyptians their influ

Birth of the Gods
...
The genesis of the Egyptian gods goes far back into prehistoric times. These earliest beginnings occurred long before Egypt's existence as a nation state and the invention of writing, so we are forced to work with only non-written evidence, often from relatively uncertain contexts and settings. Although scholars of anthropology, prehistory and religion have struggled to analyze this formative stage in Egyptian religion, the available evidence remains difficult to interpret and is subject to differing opinions. Nevertheless, it would seem to suggest ' the presence of the concept of the sacred in the existence of apparent cult objects, in human and animal burials, and in areas where formal rituals appear to have been enacted. Whether such artifacts and sites actually reflect belief in a divine being or beings is unknown but, as various scholars have stressed, the care with which the dead were buried in the prehistoric period, and the afterlife belief implied by that care, certainly suggests that the necessary intellectual sophistication was present for such belief.
Spirit, fetish, totem and god
Like most early humans the prehistoric peoples who dwelt around the Nile seem to have been reverential towards the powers of the natural world - both animate and inanimate. The former seem to have taken precedence in Egypt, although the recurrent star images found on the Gerzeh Palette and other artifacts from the later Neolithic Period (3600- 3300 BC) may indicate that an astral cult developed early in Egypt. However, the first clear divinities we find in Egypt's archaeological record are in most cases animal deities such as the cow and the falcon: gods which represented aspects of the cosmos, yet which doubtless were believed to hold sway over hun1an occupations and lives. By the late prehistoric period we find evidence of animals especially dogs (or jackals), gazelles, cattle and rams - which were buried in what appear to have been ritual contexts, and also representations of animals which may signify some kind of animism or fetishism (the idea that animals, like humans, possessed 'spirits' which must be respected and propitiated). If these zoomorphic images are not merely totems of tribal groups and do signify manifestations of the divine in some way, they represent a significant stage in the development of the Egyptian gods. The idea that the divine might be manifest in anin1al form is a vital prerequisite for the animals which are shown acting in entirely human ways and which are the major representations of the Egyptian gods at the end of the Predynastic Period. The celebrated Narmer Palette which dates to this time

In Egypt, cattle were particularly important in the development of religious belief. Recent study of the sites of Nabta Playa and BirKisseiba in the Sahara to the ·west of the upper Nile Valley has shown that cattle were perhaps venerated there long

suggesting their association with afterlife beliefs and rituals, and this background fit~ well ·with the prevalence in dynastic Egypt of the imagery of cows in association with early goddesses such as Hathor, Nut and Neith. As Fekri Hassan has stressed, 'it is very likely that the concept of the cow goddess in dynastic Egypt is a continuation of a n1uch older tradition of a primordial cow goddess or goddesses that emerged in the context of Neolithic cattleherding in the Egyptian Sahara.' Hassan has also pointed out that as both the cow and woman gave milk, both shared an identity as a source of life and nourishment. It was also the mothers who gave physical birth and sustenance - in human or bovine form - that were the symbols of powers (such as the goddess Hathor) which brought the deceased back to life through spiritual rebirth. The burial pit with its food offerings was an image of the womb, and the contracted foetal position of the earliest surviving interments may have foreshadowed the desired rebirth. There is also evidence of very early male deities who seem to be associated with hunting and n1ale fertility, and these gods may have been paired with the bovine goddesses in a parallel to the social conditions of the early Egyptian preagricultural, cattle-keeping and hunting cultures.

and political needs
cevelopment of the concept of individualized \ ·ho held povver over specific events and
natural conditions is usually seen as concurrent with the developn1ent of the desire to gain some kind of control over the world and human vulnerability. In this the needs of early human societies were the same everywhere - and did not particularly change throughout history - though the immediate vulnerability of ancient humans to attacks by wild animals and the forces of nature may have gradua\1y given way to the awareness of longer-term needs such as freedom from pain and want. Once a central government arose around 3000 BC, perceived and real needs may have changed rapidly for the ancient population of the Nile Valley. National deities came into existence as well as the cult of the divine king; and as John Baines has pointed out, the emergence of monarchy and the resultant origin of the Egyptian state effectively transformed ancient religion by providing a new focus which unified its different goals and needs. Indeed, it might be said that from this point forward, the infancy of Egypt's deities had ended and more than 3,000 years of subsequent historical development would fail to radically change the underlying nature of Egyptian religion.

It is one of the ironies of ancient Egyptian religion that although v.re must cope with a dearth of archaeological evidence regarding the origin of the gods, Egyptian texts of the later periods contain rnany clear yet often seemingly contradictory accounts of their mythic genesis, and rule of the cosmos. In recent years, many Egyptologists have come to feel that these varying accounts may not simply reflect the conflicting traditions of different cult centres, as has long been assumed, but can instead be seen as different aspects of an underlying understanding of how the world and its creator gods came into being. Certainly, there was no single, unified Egyptian myth of creation, but the major cosmogonies (stories of the origins of the universe) and theogonies (stories of the origins of the gods) associated with the most important cult centres
n1ay be more alike than is at first apparent
Latent power: the Hermopolitan view
At Hermopolis in Middle Egypt there existed developed myth of creation by means of ej original deities - the so-called 'Ogdoad' or 'grou~ eight' who represented aspects of the orig:
cosmos (seep. 77). Although rnost of the survi\textual evidence for this view of creation cofrom the Ptolemaic Period, the ancient narne Hermopolis, Khemnu or 'eight town', is attes
from the 5th dynasty (and may well go back earl. showing the antiquity of the myth. According to the Hermopolitan view the e:
primordial deities existed in four pairs of male female, each associated with a specific aspect or
ment of the pre-creation: Nun (or Nu) and Nau:. Water; Heh and Hauhet, Infinity; Kek and Kau_
Darkness; Amun and Amaunet, Hiddenness. Troriginal 'elements' were believed to be inert ye contain the potential for creation. James Hoffrn has shov,,n that interesting similarities e: between these elements and the conditions listet" immediately prior to the creation account in the lical book of Genesis. In Egypt, however, members of the Ogdoad were regarded as disc divine entities and their names were grammaticr. rnasculine and feminine to reflect the equatin creation with sexual union and birth.

In turn, this first pair produced their own children, Geb (earth) and Nut (sky), who took their respective places below and above their parents, giving the creation its full spatial extent Geb and Nut then produced the deities Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys who viewed from one perspective represented the fertile land of Egypt and the surrounding desert, so that the key elements of the Egyptian universe were completed at this time. Frequently the god Horus, son and heir of Osiris and the deity most closely associated with kingship, was added to this group, thus supplying the link between the physical creation and societal structures. All these aspects, however, were viewed as simply extensions of the original coming into being of the sun god who lay at the heart of this world view and '1vho was thus 'the father of all' and 'ruler of the gods'.

The power of thought and expression: the Memphite view
While the scholars of Heliopolis focused n1ainl~ the emergence and development of the sun g Atum, the priests of nearby Memphis lookec
creation from the perspective of their own god Pt As the god of metalworkers, craftsmen and arc tects it was natural that Ptah was viewed as great craftsman who made all things. But there also another, much deeper, link between Ptah a. the creation of the world which set the Memp~ view of creation apart. The so-called Men1pr Theology which is preserved on the Shabaka Ste in the Egyptian collection of the British Muse
reveals this important aspect of the Memphite tr logical system. While the inscription dates to 25th dynasty it was copied from a much ear source, apparently of the early 19th dyncl!though its principles may have dated to even ear. times. The text alludes to the Heliopolitan creat account centred on the god Atum, but goes on claim that the Memphite god Ptah preceded the _ god and that it was Ptah who created Atum and t.. mately the other gods and all else 'through his he and through his tongue'. The expression allud~ the conscious planning of creation and its execuc through rational thought and speech, and this sn of creation ex nihilo as attributed to Ptah by priests of 1\/lemphis is the earliest known exam of the so-called 'logos' doctrine in which the vYO is formed through a god's creative speech.

To some extent all these stories appear as kaleidoscopic V?,fiations of core mythic elements, and may indicate an effort on the part of the Egyptian theologians to incorporate deities which had arisen in different parts of Egypt, or at different times, into existing mythic frameworks. It is often the nature of the creator deities and the basis of their power which is at issue in the varying stories of the origin and rule of the gods.

'The Egyptians' ideas of the origin and nature of the cosmos help us to· understand the ultin1ate decline of their deities - for the inherent vulnerability of the gods is an integral part of Egyptian mythology and one which has important ramifications for our understanding of the ancient religion. Perhaps as Egypt's gods were progressively anthropomorphized they increasingly took on the weaknesses and limitations of their human subjects. However, according to Egyptian theological speculation, the gods themselves could, and would, eventually die - though the evidence for this must be carefully assessed and understood in context.

Even gods can die
A number of Egyptian texts show that although ~ gods were not considered to be mortal in the u~· sense, they could nevertheless die. This is clea implied in the so-called 'Cannibal Hymn' of Pyramid Texts, and is of great importance in development of even some of the greatest cul~ Egyptian religion - particularly those of the neth world god Osiris and the sun god Re. Although Egyptian texts do not ever specifically say r' Osiris died - almost certainly because such a sta 1nent would be believed to magically preserve · reality of the god's death - they, and later Classi commentators, do clearly show that Osiris ,1. slain at the hands of his antagonist Seth, and \l mummified and buried. The great sun god Re ,~ thought to grow old each day and to 'die' each nig (though for the same reason, specific mention of god's death is not found), and then to be born resurrected each day at dawn. This concept clearest in late evidence such as texts found in temples of Ptolemaic date, but it was doubtless

distinguished two-vievvs of eternity: eternal continuity (djet) and eternal recurrence (neheh). This is clear in statements such as that found in the Coffin Texts, 'l am the one Atum created - I am bound for my place of eternal sameness - It is I who am Eternal Recurrence' (CT 15). The gods could thus die and still remain in the ongoing progression of time. As Erik Hornung has stressed, the mortality of Egyptian gods 'enables them to become young again and again, and to escape from the disintegration that is the inevitable product of time'.
The end of time
Ultimately, a final end did await the gods. In Egyptian mythology it is clear that only the elements from which the primordial world had arisen would eventually remain. This apocalyptic view of the end of the cosmos and of the gods themselves is elaborated upon in an important section of the Coffin Texts in which the creator Atum states that eventually, after millions of years of differentiated creation, he and Osiris will return to 'one place', the undifferentiated condition prevailing before the creation of the world (CT VII 467- 68). ln the Book of the Dead this 'end of days' is even more clearly described in a famous dialogue between Atum and Osiris in which, when Osiris mourned the fact that he would eventually be isolated in eternal darkness, the god Atum comforted him by pointing out that only the

two of them would survive when the world eventually reverted to the primeval ocean from which all else arose. Then, it is said, Atum and Osiris would take the form of serpents (symbolic of unformed chaos) and there would be neither gods nor men to perceive them (BD 175). Despite their seemingly endless cycles of birth, ageing, death and rebirth, the gods would finally perish in the death of the cosn1os itself, and there would exist only the potentialfor life and death within the waters of chaos.
Twilight of the gods
Historically, a veritable Gotterdammerung also awaited the Egyptian gods. The eventual rise of Christianity and later of Islam spelled doom for the old pagan religion, but it did not die easily. In AD 383
pagan temples throughout the Roman Empire • closed by order of the Emperor Theodosius a-number of further decrees, culminating in th(k.i Theodosius in AD 391 and Valentinian III in AD sanctioned the actual destruction of pa religious structures. Soon most of Egypt's tem were shunned, claimed for other use, or acti destroyed by zealous Christians, and the anL gods were largely deserted. But signs of their teity are evident in many historical records.

The ancient Egyptians visualized their gods and goddesses in manifold ways, and this is demonstrated by the Egyptian word netcher, the etymology and original n1eaning of which are unknown, although examination of the word's use by the Egyptians shows that it actually encompassed a far wider range of meanings than the English vvord god. It could include deified humans (famous individuals, and from the 30th dynasty, those who had drowned) as we1l as what might be called spirits and demons, or in some cases even monsters such as the great chaos serpent Apophis. In fact, a determinative sign indicating 'god' (see box, Writing the Names of the Gods) could be added to the name of any unusual or exotic creature and even the Egyptians' hieroglyphs were themselves sometimes regarded as 'gods'.
Gods, spirits, demons and bau
In addition to their major gods the ancient Egyptians believed in various other types of supernatural beings which are often included in the category of minor deities. Even the earliest religious writings are peopled with frightening creatures (especially underworld monsters and demon-like beings) and throughout ancient Egyptian literature we find references to demons and spirits which seem to be similar to the djins and afrits of Arab culture. The ghosts or spirits of the deceased were also feared by the Egyptians and were known as akhu, a term which itself was also used of demons in the later periods. But the most feared, or at least most commonly feared, beings were the messengers and bau of deities. Bau were

Appearance of the divine
Despite the fact that the Egyptian pan appears to the outside observer to be filled v veritable menagerie of gods, goddesses and beings in an almost mindless variety of mani tions, for the most part Egyptian deities conceived in logical types consisting of ht..
(anthropon1orphic), animal (zoomorphic), h~ and composite forms. Generally, the so-called 'cosmic' gods and <lesses of the heavens and earth such as Shu,g: the air, and Nut, goddess of the sky, were anth morphic in form, as were 'geographic' deiti those representing specific areas such as r mountains, cities and estates. Certain others,n ting these categories - some of them very an
such as the fertility god Min - also took h form, as did deified humans such as deceased ' and other notables. Zoomorphic deities were also common thr
out Egyptian history. Perhaps the n1ost ardeity known in Egypt took the form of the fa and the worship of animals as representati· deities was especially prevalent in the latest ods. Gods associated with specific animal sp were viewed as male or female according to apparent or perceived characteristics. Male d often took the form of the bull, ram, falcon or and fen1ale deities were often associated wit cow, vulture, cobra or lioness. 'Hybrid' or more accurately 'bimorphic'
human and half-animal deities existed in t,~o t



The Egyptian word netcher or 'god' was usually written by means of one of a number of hieroglyphic signs which were added as 'determinatives' or group indicators at the end of names of deities, as well as being used alone. One of the commonly used signs found from Old Kingdom times was a seated divine figure (see illustration 1) which could be male or female and thus was used speci:ficaUy for gods and goddesses. Variants of this sign which signified individual deities (in a few cases standing or depicted in some other position) were also used, especially in the New Kingdom and later periods.From much earlier times the word 'god' could also be written by means of a hieroglyph depicting a falcon (2) - sometimes on a perch- doubtless indicative of the great antiquity of many of the falcon gods of Egypt. The most commonly used sign for god, however, which

As John Baines has shown, this sign has a complex history and may have developed as a means of signalling the presence of a deity without having a narrow, individual meaning associated with a specific divine power. Very late in Egyptian history the hieroglyph of a star (see illustration 4) could also be used to write the word god, but this is found only from the Ptolemaic Period on. All these signs could be written twice for dual numbers or three times for the plural 'gods' and sometimes in even larger numbers such as three groups of three signifying an ennead or group of nine gods: a writing which could also connote a 'plurality of plurality' or 'all the gods'.

associations, such as that of Re vvith the sun, different deities could share the same associations Atum, Re, Khepri, Horakhty and several other gods were all associated with the sun, for example. Conversely, many deities v.rere associated with more than one characteristic. Most of the more important gods and goddesses had many different names showing their multiple identities - and some, such as Neith and Hathor, fulfilled several distinct roles, often without exhibiting any single identity which could be said to be clearly 'prin1ary'. Generally, and often as a result of fusion of lesser deities, the greater the deity the wider the range of his or her associations and identities. The characters of individual deities and their relationships with humanity could be widely different. Some deities were viewed as particularly helpful to humans. Thoth, Horus and Isis were all

case. While the centre of vvorship of the great god Amun was located at Thebes, for example, it seems that he was not himself of Theban origin. Change could also affect the organization of gods. As time progressed, many of the cults of the major deities were organized into family triads of a 'father', 'mother', and 'son' - as with Amun, Mut and Khonsu at Thebes; or Ptah, Sekhmet and Nefertem at Mernphis. This development effectively strengthened the position of some deities and meant that others, not included in important temple 'families', tended to be relegated to less important status and were Jess likely to receive culticservice. Even the character or nature of deities could change with time, and perhaps the most dramatic example of this is found in the god Seth, whose perceived nature, popularity and importance fluctuated widely in different periods. The process of change often occurred in one of two ways - through the assimilation of a less important deity by a greater one or, n1ore rarely, by the assimilation of a characteristic of a great deity by a lesser one. The god Osiris provides an excellent example of thefirst situation, as he took on many epithets and characteristics from deities which he assirnilated during the wide-ranging spread of his cult. On the other hand, the often superlative role played by solar theology in Egyptian religion led to the association of many lesser deities with the sun god or solar characteristics. 1'he phenomenon is especially noticeable in later periods, and in temples of the Ptolemaic Period we find Hathor, Isis, Horus, Khnum and other deities praised not only as the children of the sun god but also as solar deities in their own right with clear solar epithets and iconographic attributes. Egypt's gods were thus susceptible to change through time regarding their very natures as well as their relative importance.

God as many gods
In the Egyptian texts the gods are often said to be 'rich in names', and the multiplicity of names (and therefore manifestations) exhibited by individual deities provides an important example of the principle whereby one god may be seen as many. In the New Kingdom text known as the Litany of Re the solar god is identified in 'all his evolutions' as 75 different deities - including not only common forms of the sun but also female deities such as Isis and Nut. Osiris received prayers and litanies of praise under many names, and the mythological story explaining how his body was torn into pieces and scattered throughout Egypt provides an example of how one god could become many. Yet this example is unique and such a physical explanation for multiple instances and locations of a deity ,vas not necessary for the application of the principle. In the Ptolemaic temple of Edfu we find that the goddess Hathor is represented by as many forms as there are days in the year (and each of these is actually named as two variant forms), but there seems to have been no mythic backdrop to this situation which would have required the Egyptians to posit many independent forms of the goddess. Perhaps the ultimate example of the multiplicity of divine names is to be found in the great god Amun, who was given so many names that the number was said to be unknowable. Another aspect of the multiple nan1es of individual gods can be seen in those cases vvhere a given deity was regarded as the ba or manifestation of another. Of the god Khnum, for exa1nple, it was often said that he was the 'ba of Re' or of Osiris

~~m:· other smaller groups of deities such as the 1:r101::,, triads, tetrads, pentads, hexads, hebdo1nd ogdoads (see p. 74-79) were also formed, i;re is no clear pattern in the development of !Toups and certainly no gradual movement ..: smaller groupings which might indicate kind of preliminary progression toward t:OJootl eism. In the same manner, although the et:::lber three ,vas utilized by the Egyptians to sig~ a closed system which was both complete and tr::J:f'clctive among its parts, the many triads of C2f'.'ttc- \\·hich developed in Egyptian religion were oo •·ay directly con1parable to the Christian idea e trir1ity. Egyptian groups of three deities J5ually linked in a father-mother-child union, 1~ \Vas never expressed as a unity, and each
member of the triad preserved his or her distinct individuality as a separate deity.
Syncretis1m
There is, nevertheless, a good deal of evidence for the Egyptian practice of linking or bringing together different deities into the body or identity of a combined god or goddess (sometimes, though not always, with 'composite' form). This ,vas accomplished in several ways, most commonly by bringing deities together through the linkage of their names, creating composite gods such as Atum-Khepri, Re-Horakhty, and Amun-Re. Some of these syncretisms may be seen as simple combinations of similar deities or even different aspects of the same god - Aturn-Khepri combined the evening and morning manifestations of the sun and ReHorakhty formed a composite of two other important aspects or forms of the solar deity.

In the 19th century a debate arose among Egyptologists which was to rage for many years and which is still not entirely over. The debate has centred around a fundamental aspect of Egyptian religion: were the ancient Egyptians at all times polytheists or were there times or even ongoing trends in which Egyptian religion moved slowly but inexorably towards monotheism?
Believers in One god or Many
In his early 1930s work The Dawn of Conscience, the American Egyptologist James Henry Breasted argued that the religion of the heretic 18th-dynasty pharaoh, Akhenaten - who attempted to do away with most of Egypt's traditional gods and to replace them with the worship of the solar disk or Aten (see

Egyptian religion had, in fact, originally monotheistic and had only eventually degeneinto a morass of separate cults after the found:. the Egyptian state. Although the argument fckind of primitive monotheism and the idea single, transcendent deity has long been disca.
the idea that the Egyptians did gradually de monotheistic ways of thought has been more ing. Some scholars have seen the successive r
pre-eminent deities such as Re, Osiris and Am precisely this kind of development. Others ha that the Egyptian word for god, netcher, used out reference to any particular god (whic}, especially common in Egyptian 'wisdom liter or 'instructions' and in personal names which bined the word god with some other element demonstrated the idea of an underlying sing' in Egyptian religion. In an influential work pub in 1960 Siegfried Morenz drew these argu."" together in support of the idea that behind ther countless deities of the Egyptian pantheon vvas, historically, among at least some Egypti.. growing awareness of a single god. But another side to the story appeared \,-i publication of an incisive study by Erik Horn, 1971. Hornung systematically examined
question, and found no evidence for an on movement towards monotheism. Of central itance, he argued that the word 'god' in E~ usage never appears to refer to an abstract dthigher order than other gods but is rather a n
term which can apply to any deity, or as Hoexpressed it, 'whichever god you wish'. In the manner, personal names such as Mery-Tlt:' translated as 'whom god loves', could mean ar and may be found with many specified pa: such as 'whom Ptah loves'.

syncretism). These viewpoints existed concurrently in Egypt throughout most of the Dynastic Period, but in the religion of Akhenaten the concept of the
emanation of the god Aten is not to be found. It is through generation alone that the Aten recreates the \;vorld and all that is in it. In this view, although visible and in that sense immanent in his creation, the Aten also transcended it in the manner found in true monotheism.

Believers in the Many and the One
More recently, James Allen has suggested a synthesis of the two opposing views of Egyptology regarding Akhenaten's monotheism. One approach (accepted mainly by earlier Egyptologists) views Akhenaten's ideas as derivative of concepts present in Egyptian religion long before that king's reign, and the other (championed by Erik Hornung) sees Akhenaten's religion - especially his monotheism as a radical innovation without any precedent whatsoever. Allen accepts evidence from both sides and provides a new perspective. While stressing that Hornung is certainly right in pointing to the distinction between Akhenaten's monotheism and earlier Egyptian understandings of god, Allen has shown that what was radical about Akhenaten's theology vvas not its proclamation of the oneness of god but its insistence on exclusivity. The polyvalent logic of Egyptian thought could easily allow an appreciation of the underlying oneness of god to coexist with traditional Egyptian polytheism. He suggests, in fact, that the best evidence for this is actually the phenomenon of syncretism which 'unites the view of god as simultaneously Many and One'. This is not to say that Egyptian religion was essentially '1nonotheism with a polytheistic face' - and the perception of god as essentially One may perhaps have been limited to a few Egyptian theologians at any one time. But maybe for even ordinary Egyptians the experience of god could have been to some extent monotheistic - while they continued to view the world in polytheistic tern1s, they also identified their uniform notion of 'god' with a particular god in specific situations. The advantage of this view is that vvhile it accepts Hornung's valid criticism of many individual pieces of proof of Egyptian monotheism, it nevertheless allows evidence as to the attitude that

~he Concept of - ranscendence
question of whether the ancient Egyptians ever ·Yed in the concept of monotheism contains with-:elf another question-whether they developed dea of a transcendent deity. Although earlier .:ping affirmations in this regard have not stood eSt of time and scholarly analysis, the idea of ~endent divine ability - especially as manifest in :anscendence of space and time - may neverthebe reflected in some of the Egyptian evidence. , early as the Instruction for Merikare {apparently j)OSed in Middle Kingdom times) we find the ..ession 'the god knows every name', indicating ;aps the idea of an omniscient god. By late New .::dom times we find instances of the great god
1:1 being viewed in a manner which could indicate : inhis transcendent ability. One text states that ~ hears the prayer of one ,vho calls to him, in a ,ent he comes from afar to the one who cries out :n·. Afew other texts seem to echo this same Jde. While they may indicate only that Amun was ~ viewed as acting ona grander and wider scale -~T1 had been common before Ramessid times, there
furn indication that the concept of transcendence , :1ot involved. Certainly the Egyptian gods did not 1ately transcend time - as was seen in Part 1;_ise like their human counterparts they were subold age and eventual demise. Nor could they rranscend space, as they could not penetrate the :- regions beyond the created cosmos which orian mythology explicitly states is uninhabited :e gods, or those regions of the Duat where the
1f the sun god does not penetrate. Yet, despite •iacts, it is possible that from the Egyptians' peri\·e, there was an idea of relative - if not absolute :1scendence in the religion of the late New .:dom. The few texts which address the subject do ~ to show that Amun was viewed as transcending e u:ithin the world in which the gods were created
:anctioned. We may also find, with the san1e g-od, , ,\·hich intimate the god's transcendence of even unds of the Egyptians' mythicalcosmos. . Tus Leiden I 350 says of Amun:
, hidden from the gods, and his aspect is unknown.
, iarther than the sky, he is deeper than the Duat. ..'
:::-. text the 'unknowable nature' of Amun is the issue which is stressed, yet the expression 'He is :er than the sky, he is deeper than the Duat' seems :icate a view of the deity's transcendence of the
her ,theis1n, but simply "god".' From this perspecc-> the Egyptians vvere in a sense both polytheists .: monotheists, and the religion of Akhenaten ._· have had certain precedents in formal theology even in popular attitudes which a1nount to the " of god in the singular. Rather than its radical -us on one god, however, it was a dogmatic exclu
cosmos itself and is not essentially different from the sentiment of the biblical Psaimist, Jong regarded by scholars as reflecting the transcendent omnipresence of the Helbrevv God:
'Where shall I go from your spirit? Or where should I flee
from your presence?
If I ascend up into heaven, you are there; If I make my
bed in hell, behold you are there.' Psalm 139:7-8
It is also possible to view the nature of Akhenaten's Aten as being transcendent in certain ways (see p. 236) and the fact that in the Late Period the solar ram was said to have not only four heads, but also 777 ears and millions of eyes, shows the idea of the greatly enhanced senses of the god in a practical, mythical manner. While this does not prove omniscience, it is not essentially different from the theological develop• ments of later history which posit the idea of a God who sees even the smallest event.
siveness that set the religion of Akhenaten apart and that ultimately made his theology unacceptable to most ancient Egyptians. It would only be with the eventual rise of Judaism, Christianity and Islam that such exclusivity in the worship of the One would take hold, and in so doing, would historically spell the end for Egypt's Many.
1'he god Amun came to be revered as a dei.ty whose nature included a transcendent aspect close to that of th.e monotheistic god of Judaism, Christianity or Islam. Detail, statue of Amun from Thebes. Luxor

From the very establishment of the ancient Egyptian state around 3000 BC, religion developed along two separate paths - which often ran in very different directions. On the one hand, individual veneration of the gods continued to develop its own stresses and focal points (which are considered in the next section). On the other hand, the founding of the monarchical state enhanced the development of state-favoured and subsidized cults which served the gods formally.
Houses of the gods
Unlike the gods of the ancient Greeks and some other cultures, Egyptian deities did not readily 1nix with their hu1nan subjects, and their interaction was usually found in specific contexts and areas, the most important of which was the temple. From the small reed huts of predynastic times to the towering stone structures of the ew Kingdom and later periods, temples were the focal points of individual population centres and of Egyptian society as a whole. Unlike modern cathedrals, churches,

eMple service
:::ervice and care of the gods was thus parai;,;..,l,A. nt not only to the Egyptians' sense of religious ~ nsibility toward their deitie..s but also to the
-~· nuation of existence itself. This was effected Jgh the practice of rituals which supported ."!ods so that they in turn might be able to "'<.'rYe and sustain the world. In fact, Dimitri -~ has sho,vn that a single common feature reel by the various beings called 'gods' by the • ptians is that they were the recipients of ritual. -:;e rituals vvere of many types but are most _· cJassi:fied on a temporal basis. Viewed this . ,,·e may differentiate the daily ritual service of ~ods which tended their basic needs; the occa~1 but regular rituals which were part of the nent festivals of the temple calendar; and finally, non-regular rituals which were performed only ...pecial occasions or under special circumstances. :.ials of the third class were naturally the least -:monly enacted and are rarely depicted in temple nes, while those of festival and daily rituals rate the walls of many Egyptian temples. irtually all cases, hovvever, temple depictions ritual service do not reflect the reality of the al b'ut are rather an idealized representation in ch the king and deity are the sole participants.

IS aspect of temple function was rooted in the
mythic reality of the king as legitin1ate descendant and heir of the gods - concepts which will be examined later. However in actual practice it was, of course, the priests who acted as the king's surrogates and who usually performed the rituals involved in the care of the gods.

Creating Bodies for the Gods
Cult images of the gods were produced from only the n1ostpermanent or symbolically significant materials, and the production of a divine statue was considered as an act of creation accomplished by human craftsmen with the help of the gods themselves. There was thus something of the supernatural about the divine image even from its initial design and fashioning at the craftsmen's hands. Mythologically, the skin of the gods was said to be of pure gold so divine images were often gilded or made entirely with the precious metal. Their hair was said to be like lapis lazuli so this semi•precious stone was often inset into statues of
deities to signify their hair and eyebrows. Symbolic connections were also made vvith the deity by n1eans of the materials used in its image - lunar deities, for example, often being inset with silver, which signified the moon. The connection between the image and the deity it represented was made total, however, through the rite of the 'opening of the mouth'. This ritual symbolically removed all traces of human origin from the image and .instilled it with the emanation of the deity. At this point the image was believed to become the invisible deity's visible body on earth. As such it 'lived' and fulfilled the function not only of an intermediary but as the very nexus of interaction between this world and beyond.

Images of the gods
The object of this service was the divine image. the statue of the deity housed within the sanctu_ of the temple was the focal point of the entire c As a result, the amount of work dedicated to production of divine images was often considera and the results doubtless awe-inspiring. Although they were not considered to be the g themselves, statues of gods and goddesses \\ believed to house the spirits or manifestatiollithe deities, and because of this they were treated though they were alive. Divine images were ta from their shrines each day and washed, dressed clean clothes, adorned with precious orname and censed. They were given offerings of food a: drink - usually wine, milk or water - and C: returned to their shrines. The distinction bet,\the medium of the statue and the separate iden of the deity is clear in textual sources, however:

T·hese vvere often the temples of other deities, •heir own outlying temples where the deity would ply take up temporary occupancy for the dura
i of the festival or special event.
=estiva.ls, rituals and mysteries
e festivals of the deities provided the structural 'lle\vork for many of the important rituals focus::- on the gods and on cultic or cosn1ic renewal. tivol calendars' or lists of ritual activities were :-.Jibed on the walls and doorways of temples and ' et1 included the offerings to be made not only in regt1lar daily service but also on all the particular ~ days celebrated in the temple's cult. Rene.wal is particularly important in these festi. as their purpose was ultimately directed to the -ne kind of rejuvenation or rebirth achieved each in the constant solar cycle. Thus, one of the rit' pertormed on New Year's Day - also called 'the -r-h of Re' - and most fully recorded in Ptolemaic ~.es h1volved carrying the statues of deities up to tert1ple roof. Here the god or goddess could see .d be united with the rising sun in a moment of .a.red rebirth. Many of the same rituals and relig- performances were enacted on a number of : festivals such as those of the first day of the cmonth (New Year) and the first day of the fifth nth (celebrating the rebirth of Osiris). Some fesa]s had their own particularly focused meanings, course, but renewal or rebirth was a predomi,c theme in a great number of them. The power of the gods was also tapped and lier maintained by means of rituals utilized on :scheduled special occasions. This could be the 11d of ritual employed in the 'opening of the ,t1th' ceremony in order to animate a temple statue ., it could be one with much wider application. The iddess Sekhmet, for example, was regarded as a tential bringer of plague and disease who metimes had to be propitiated and her priests
ere often skilled in medicine. Placation could be complished through large-scale magico-religious :uals performed in the temples as ,vell as through ,re focused rituals directed at individual sufferers. :bus rituals for the care of humanity ultimately .::o served to care for the gods. :\lany aspects of the daily service, festival and μecial rituals were described by the Egyptians as ""'lysteries' (Egyptian shetau). In fact, by virtue of
its supernatural basis, any ritual might be said to be a mystery. More particularly, any part of a ritual which was conducted privately, beyond the vie,v of the people at large, was given this name because it was also hidden and part of the secret knowledge of the priests and others who were skilled in its performance. A general atmosphere of secrecy was developed by the priesthoods as time progressed, but in reality the same priests sometimes performed similar rituals - such as the 'opening of the mouth' - in both hidden and open settings, and the boundaries between formal temple ceremonies and private ritual were probably blurred to some degree.

l Popular Religion and Plett ;

46
Although the common people played little or no active part in the formal rituals conducted by the official cults, they had their own opportunities and avenues for worship of their deities. Herodotus' often quoted statement that the Egyptians were 'religious beyond measure...more than any other people' seems to have applied not only to the great temples with their multitudes of priests and elaborate service of the gods, but also to the piety of many ordinary people. But achieving a fuller assessment of popular religion in ancient Egypt is n1ade difficult by a number of factors. As John Baines has stressed, on the one hand, the archaeological record is incomplete since far less is knovvn of the religious practices of people living in towns, villages and rural areas than about the formal worship that took place in the cult temples of gods and kings. On the other hand, the archaeological record itself can be somewhat misleading. While a great deal of the ancient Egyptian material which has
survived is religious in nature, the bulk of it was
produced by and for the society's elite - the royal and noblefamilies. ,.fheir religion was not necessarily the san1e as that of the common people, however, and in some cases it was clearly different. We do not know to what degree religious piety vvas present throughout Egypt's various social classes or to what extent this situation changed over time. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, a fair amount is known about popular religion - at least in certain areas and times - and we can only presume that what is known is indicative of the broader picture.
Access to the gods
In the earlier periods of Egyptian history there vvas often no clear distinction between the priesthood and other members of society, as temple service was conducted by individuals vvho, after their assigned rotation of duties, returned to secular work in their communities. However, in New Kingdom and later tin1es when the priestly offices became professional and largely hereditary ones, the situation changed considerably, and we find a much greater gap between the population at large and those involved in formal service of the gods. Lay individuals could place votive offerings in the outer areas of temples, but the chief occasions during which they could approach the gods vvere public festivals. At these times lay people might witness the procession of a deity, although it would be from a decorous distance and usually the actual
in1age of the god would not be visible tc Those outside the priesthood had access to ·tear' shrines placed in the outer walls of rnar ples, and the colossal statues in front of their were also readily accessible to the people as tors of their prayers. In some temples th.could also be approached through oracles would answer important questions, and a people also had some access to the gods irmatters. This was sometimes accomp through specific movements of the god's P' shrine barque while it was being carried in ~ sion, when questions were addressed to theThough we do not know how commonly this oracular manifestation occurred or how \,1 was accessible, it is probable that such guid: the gods was sought when the courts were n to settle a matter. Another way in which the common peop access to the gods was through dreams. For tians, the sleeper temporarily inhabited the,, the gods, and dreams could thus often · contact with the gods. The best-knovvn exarr
this are found in the records of New Ki.. monarchs such as 1uthmosis IV to whom the Sphinx spoke as a god in a dream, but even tt hun1ble con1n1oner could dream of deities same manner. Magical texts describe the me: of many such dreams which might be exper and we have ample evidence of dream~ actively elicited as means to understanding r of the gods.

Gifts to the gods
Pious visitors to temples donated perishabl,ings such as food, drink or flowers as ' non-perishable gifts dedicated to the gods r from simple trinket-like objects to finely can painted statues and votive stelae. These latte
represent the most important votive gifts f archaeological contexts. Statues given as gifts to the gods or plaa:
shipfully before them were produced ir numbers in many periods. Most of the sta have survived from ancient Egypt are in facpieces donated to the gods by kings, nobles. and various officers of the state, and even as tive gifts from cities and towns. Such



ruary usually comprised individual or group fig- of gods, sometimes with the inclusion of an rmediary royal or priestly figure, and these ,ne images could range from individually crafted rk to mass-produced figures of gods and god-,es utilized by the less wealthy. In the Late and :emaic Periods the private donation of votive ,ze statues grew tremendously, and the developrit of casting techniques led to the production of aJUP.tless metal images of deities and sacred ani
mals for devotional purposes and as offerings to temples and shrines. Votive stelae were of different types, though many bore texts requesting favours fTom the gods and sometimes gave thanks for their help when it seemed that a request had been granted. The styles of such stelae varied geographically and changed over time but usually depicted the donor, sometimes together with members of his or her family, worshipping the deity to whom the stela was dedicated.

In New Kingdom times in particular, such stelae also often depicted one or more large pairs of ears as symbolic listening devices to ensure that the supplicant's prayers were 'heard' by the god. Such 'ear' stelae may be almost completely covered with these depictions or decorated with the representation of a single, huge, pair of ears - presumably increasing the 'auditory' effectiveness of the stelae.
Private worship and person.al piety
From the Middle Kingdom onwards we find stelae showing the direct worship of Osiris by the
deceased and a 'personal piety' movement beg: develop, eventually resulting in more direct d. access for the common people - perhaps in cor to the increasingly hereditary and profess
nature of the priesthood. Thus, by New Kin times, in addition to the great temples stafft-, courses of priests there were numerous sn1al: shrines in which prayers could be offered or ' offerings left for the deity to whom the shrine dedicated. In the workmen's village of Ix Medina in western Thebes there were shril"' this type honouring Amun, Hathor, Ptah, T Isis, Osiris, Anubis and other gods as well as et. deities of foreign origin such as Astarte Qadesh. A shrine to Hathor excavated there vides an example of one apparently rece1vin.. veneration mainly of women. These local shrines show evidence of a good of use, but it appears that the religion of ;Egyptians may have been dominated by the "·e tion of personal or local gods honoured in smaller household shrines. Homes excavateda el-Medina contained niches in which were ke;images of departed relatives and also of hous deities - most commonly the god Bes and tht' dess Taweret. These deities had the power to off evil, appearing on plaques or as amulets were attached to household objects or worn r person. \J\fhile such plaques and amulets m:.
considered apotropaic or protective magic r than worship per se, the two can hardly be sep ed, as the Egyptian gods figured prominen all types of magical rituals and procedures a at procuring desirable conditions or a Yl undesirable ones. The wish to control or tasupernatural powers of the cosmos was pen
in the religions of the ancient \Vorld and E was certainly no exception, for its vast pan· provided a rich realm of possible allies ir practice of religious magic.

l?elationships with ·· the Divine
The rernains of tombs, temples and dwellings at the workmen's village al Deir elMedina, western Thebes, a
key site for our knowledge of ancient Egyptian religion and everyday life.
[t is in the writings of the Egyptians themselves that we gain our deepest insights into their attitudes towards their religion and to the gods. There is a considerable body of textual evidence to support the contention that for many Egyptians their personal religious outlook and belief in the gods extended well beyond mere superstition. To be sure, it is possible to see selfish and transitory human needs and desires beneath many of these texts, but the level of personal piety often appears high. Of particular value in this regard are texts found at Deir el-Medina. While the inhabitants of the ancient village of this site - the workmen and artisans who constructed the royal tombs of the Nevv Kingdom may not have been entirely typical of Egyptian society the texts they left do provide fascinating insights into non-forn1al religion and especially into the relationships of the Egyptians with their gods. But these texts are not our only written evidence.
From even earlier periods we find texts of , gratitude for answered prayers, hymns and of praise, and texts which request the help gods in humble but eloquent ways. Such, for ple, is a prayer of the 11th-dynasty monarch asking for protection through the darkness
night and for the continued gift of life. vrr

A merciful and personal deity
Personal piety appears to have reached a hig in New Kingdom times - when it was belie, the gods could forgive human sins - and is p m.ost clear1y seen in the so-called 'penitentia which have survived to us from Deir el-~ These range from formal compositions 1nscn carved stelae to simple graffiti and include tions dedicating them to Amun, Ptah. •

In the final era of Egypt's ancient history the supreme position of Isis and the wide range of her cult appear to have been due, to a very large degree, to the personal relationship of the goddess with her followers and the promise of salvation which was tied to this bond. Often this personal relationship with the deity is seen as purely a development of the Graeco-Roman era, but its precedents in Egypt are clear and provided a fertile ground for the eventual development of Isis worship as a road to personal salvation in later times.

Once Egypt had been united and a central government established, the cult of the living king seems to have been developed in addition to the cults of local and national deities. This fact tends to be taken for granted, but we know very little about how this situation came to be, and if or to \¥hat extent the early king was viewed as divine in his lifetime. Even in the later historical periods \¥hen evidence is clearer and more plentiful, there is disagreen1ent among scholars as to the degree to which the Egyptian king vvas regarded as human, divine, or as both.
King ship and divinity
That the living Egyptian king was viewed as divine certainly appears possible. In representations the
king is depicted far larger than his human sub~ and on the same scale as the gods themselve.s. only were monarchs said to be 'like' (Egyptian or the 'image of' (Egyptian tiet, or tut) van deities, but the word netcher or 'god' was alsc quently used as an epithet of kings. The fortitulary of the Egyptian king also spelled ou: relationship with several key deities, indicating he \¥as not only viewed as the son of Re durin~ lifetime (from the 4th dynasty on), but also ~ living manifestation or image of the falcon Horus (perhaps from the beginning of the Dyna. Period). There are other important lines of evid for this point of view.The myth of the king's ch birth, for example, was developed in the _ Kingdom but was apparently not something in• ed by Hatshepsut, as is sometimes stated. seems to have existed since at least fl.I: Kingdom times. Even before this, the underi purpose of the complex genealogy of the gods structed by the priests of Heliopolis may have h as much to establish the divine lineage and na of the king as to establish the order of creati fact seen by Rudolf Anthes as early as the n1idd the last century. As a result of this type of evid



Henri Frankfort, in his important study Kingship
i thP Gods, and a good many other scholars, have ~ie,,ed that the pharaoh's rites of coronation and :cession elevated him to identity with the gods. On the other hand, this n1ay not be the only condasion that can be drawn from the sources which p,., "·ide our information on Egyptian kingship. Tt-iere is no doubt whatsoever that the living king 1s regarded as subservient to the gods and that in
tt eory, and to some degree in practice, every king ted as their servant in the enactment of temple rit-a!s. The evidence considered above may also be r::,ved in different ways. 'fhe frequent identi:fican of the king with various deities could often be -le tnore than hyperbole. Marie-Ange Bonheme ~ also recently pointed out that while the king's rmal names may indicate an aspect of divinity in e monarch, they do not clarify the 'degree of inity' which is involved. As early as 1960, ' orges Posener showed that the image of the liv~ pharaoh as a god-king is perhaps exaggerated the royal and religious sources which aim to 1ghten the divine aspect of kingship. In popular erature and texts the Egyptian king is hardly porayed as a god. He cannot work the miracles of his 3e rnen and is certainly neither omniscient nor Yulnerable in the way we would expect if he were uly regarded as divine. From this perspective it uld seem that it was not the king who was honred as a god but the incarnate power of the gods at ,vas honoured in the king.
· divine duality
~e truth is probably to be found in a balance of ese v1evvs. From the human perspective the
Egyptian king was vievved as one of the gods - he is called such and depicted along with other gods in divine scenes. On the other hand, it could be said that from a divine perspective the king was still

human and was, of course, subject to human frailties and mortality. This dual nature of the living king - human and divine - seems to be implicit in the serekh, the device in \.Vhich the king's name was written from early times (showing the god Horus atop the royal palace), and in the royal titulary which was drawn up at the king's accession from Middle Kingdom times. The nesut-bit or 'two ladies' title preceded the king's formal throne name, and has long been interpreted as signifying only rulership over Upper and Lower Egypt. But it may refer, in fact, to the divine identity of the king in general (nesut) and the current human holder of theoffice in the line of kingly succession (bit). Beginning with Siegfried Morenz, a number of scholars have shown that the dual nature of the king may also be seen in contrasting nesut \.Vith another Egyptian word relating to kingship - hem, usually translated 'majesty'. The first word, nesut, refers to the divine power held by the king and used in the exercise of
kingly roles, whereas the second word, hein, re: refers to the idea of the individual in ~.rhom divine power is incarnate. These two terms · sometimes used together (hem en nesut) mear something like 'the incarnation of (di, kingship'. Accepting this duality amounts to a vie, Egyptian monarchical ideology which underst::. the king as being in effect both human and dr during his lifeti111e. This apparent contradil would have hardly been seen as problematic b: ancient Egyptians, whose theological srs· contained many such enigmas. The appacontradiction w·as resolved practically in thed\L.. of the king's role - in essence, the nature o,Egyptian king depended upon the situation. king represented the gods to his peoplt as a .. and also the people of Egypt to the gods human. Theologically neither the divine nor hu1nan realm could function without him.



Deified in life
espite the human-divine duality inherent in the . ~ gn of most Egyptian pharaohs there were ~ranees when living kings do seem to have been -clared fully divine within their ovvn lifetin1es. This ,vas not the result of arbitrary theological or : al decree, however, and it seems clear that such -4ngs usually 'earned' their immortality through 11g and successful reigns. The clearest evidence .. this comes from the New Kingdom; although the e>.act details of the situation are not always clear,
tlk living deification of Amenophis III and an1esses II are relatively well attested. In the case " _-\n1enophis III,· we find that towards the end of
t .... reign this king began the increasing solarization Egypt's major cults and of his own kingship. ~cording to the reconstruction of events by it._-mond Johnson and others, at the time of his Sed ·bilee celebrated in the 30th year of his reign the cing declared himself deified and merged with the
solar disk as the Aten or as Re-Horakhty. From this time we find the king taking diviqe prerogatives in his representations such as those showing him with the curved beard of the gods, with the horns of Amun and wearing the lunar crescent and sun disk or presenting an offering before a statue of himself. Even here, however, the evidence of royal deification may not be what it appears on the surface. Betsy Bryan has pointed out that Amenophis may not have intended by his ovvn deification to have transcended kingship on earth permanently and that the cultic and political uses of a divine ruler could have been lin1ited to prescribed occasions such as the king's Sed festival. Representations of living deified kings in the presence of deities shov,r a level of equality which transcends that found in normal scenes of the king among the gods. In the inner shrine of the great rock-cut temple of Abu Simbel, for example, the deified R.amesses II had four statues cut to repre

sent Ptah, Re-1-Iorakhty, Amun-Re and himself, seated side by side. That the king is not simply depicted in the company of the gods is clear as the figures are shown as incontrovertible equals. It has even been suggested that in this group the king might be represented as an embodiment or manifestation of all these national gods. We can only be sure that in some circumstances the living Egyptian king could be declared divine in a manner which transcended the aspect of divinity which was taken on at the coronation. Whether this deification of the living monarch equalled that accorded deceased kings in permanency or in degree we may never know. The nature of Akhenaten is also of particular interest in regard to the question of monarchical divinity but is difficult to ascertain. While some scholars have seen this king as taking the role of
divine son of the god Aten, others have seen hr: a member of a kind of divine triad whICh included his queen Nefertiti. More recently, a nuof Egyptologists have pointed out what appe be associations with traditional Egyptian theology even within the Amarna Period. Eu Cruz-Uribe has shown that just as An1enoph n1ay have been equated with the Aten, anc queen Tiye with Hathor,complex parallels may been promulgated which suggested the equa.ri the living Akhenaten with the god Shu, Khepr other solar deities, Nefertiti with Tefnut, and sibly, a royal daughter with the goddess IVIaat.

Divine Royal :tatues
Statues of Egyptian kings functioned as integral parts of divine cults, often serving as intermediaries between the people and the gods within or at the entrances to temples and also - especially in later New Kingdom times - sometimes being regarded as divine themselves. Statues such as the titanic figure of Ramesses II set up in western Thebes - \vhich was the subject of Shelley's poem 'Ozymandias' - were given special names, could own land, had their own attendant priesthoods, and were venerated as gods in their own right. A group of artifacts known as the Horbeit
Stelae throw particular light on this phenomenon. The stelae, which were found in the eastern Delta near the. modern Qantir, come from the region of Ramesses II's chief Delta residence and attest to the presence of a cult of several colossal statues of the king in that area. One of these stelae (that of Seti-er-neheh) depicts a statue of the deified Ramesses II along with the great gods Amun and Ptah in a manner which makes the importance of the statue unmistakable. Another stela (that of the military commander Mose) depicts
Ramesses II in a unique manner. In its lower register the stela shovvs a colossal seated statue of Ran1esses next to a smaller figure of the king (which is apparently intended as a divine manifestation of the statue) giving gifts to Mose. The statue and its manifestation both share the same name and show the divine nature of the deified king's image. Of great interest for our understanding of ancient Egyptian theology are scenes which have survived to us of kings presenting sacrifices to deified stahies of them
selves. An example is found! in the representation of Amenophis Ill offering to an image of himself in his temple atSoleb. Such depictions are based on the concept of dual (earthly and heavenly) roles played by the gods themselves. Beginning in the 01d Kingdom.,~,e find evidence for the idea of deities being manifest both in the heavens or 'beyond' and in the physical sphere on earth, just: as the living king was himself a manifestation of the earthly .rlorus as opposed to the god Horus in the heavens. Thus, a
king deified in his own lifetime - within the physicalsphere could sacrifice to his own self as a deity in the spiritual sphere.

While what \Ve might call full deification occurred for some monarchs within their lifetimes, it was usually in death that this state was reached and a good deal of evidence seems to show that the deceased Egyptian king was venerated as a 'full' god. A number of Egyptian queens were also deified in death - including the illustrious AhmoseNefertari of the 18th dynasty and later queens such as Arsinoe II, Berenike II, and Cleopatra III, V, and VII of the Ptolemaic Period. Although the situation is somewhat different for deceased queens and cannot be examined in detail here, a number of similarities certainly existed between the deification of kings and queens.
Dead kings as living gods
The close relationship between the deceased king and the gods may be seen in the textual and representational evidence associated with the royal mortuary cults from early times. The Pyramid Texts clearly attempt to place the deceased king on the same level as the gods- both by directly asserting that he is a god, and by stating that he 'is' Osiris, Re, or some other deity. In some cases the texts not only show the deceased king's parity with the divine cohort, but they also stress his ascendance over the other gods, shovving that he is certainly not
viewed as a minor deity in the afterlife. We know if these assertions of the deceased deity were originally statements of formall. belief or whether they represented a desired tion which was attempted through the use magical texts. The idea of the king's deified a• was certainly established by Old Kingdom however, and the same types of textual evide:found in royal n1ortuary contexts throt.. subsequent periods of Egyptian history. Rep: tations of the deceased king in the preser deities likewise indicate equality between r. from early times. The very purpose of the royal mortu~ seems to have been the affirmation of the da. monarch's divinity, yet the specific nature c divinity must not be overlooked. A number of ago William l\!Iurnane showed, in a study texts and representations of the great mo:temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, that of the focus of the royal mortuary cult \l ongoing reaffirmation of the king's divine kir rather than eternal life per se. This conclusic. expanded in later studies of other mo-temples dating back to the Old Kingdom, and seems clear that in many if not all cases the st" all these royal mortuary establishments is



"lrinuation of the king's reign on a divine level in e afterlife. It must not be forgotten that even from ,.elatively early date - perhaps by the end of the
d Kingdom - funerary spells for the afterlife ansformation to the divine became available to her classes of society. Nobles, and later others, c uld also aspire to become gods in the afterlife. It is rithinkable that these individuals regarded their 'terlife state to be equivalent to that of the king or e great gods. It seems far more likely that what as envisaged for both commoner and king alike a~ an afterlife which represented a kind of divi12ed state of their own socialstations in life. In the ise of the deceased king, there were specific asso~tions which might be seen as elevating his irion above that of his earthly reign. This is seen rarticularly in the concepts of the royal ancestors, nd of the king as Osiris and Re.
The royal ancestors
. Jchough in reality Egyptian civilization was ruled y kings of many houses and families, Egyptian 1ngship ideology made use of a particular fiction ,, rhe form of the 'royal ancestors'. This represented .. kind of monarchical fan1ily line reaching back ~ ough the ages and linking the living king with ,js deceased 'forebears'. This doe.s not mean that
direct lineage was implied - in fact the official genealogies omit unorthodox or aberrant rulers such as I-Iatshepsut or Akhenaten. However there \vas a kind of continuum between the living king, his 'forebears' and, ultimately, the gods who ruled as kings at the beginning of the world. Some kings of the pastwere particularly venerated. Senwosret III of the 12th dynasty, for example, was remembered for his subjugation of the region to the south of Egypt and was honoured by a small temple built by Tuthmosis III some 400 years later at el-Lessiya in Nubia. Yet less illustrious rulers were also absorbed into the ancestral tradition upon their deaths, and most were chronicled in the king-lists inscribed in temples such as that of Sethos I at Abydos, where the cartouches of past rulers received veneration and offerings. Representations at a number of sites show that the ancestors also
played an important role in various royal and rehgious rituals. Scenes carved under Ram.esses II and Ran1esses III shovving the harvest festival of the god l\1in, for example, show statues of the royal ancestors being carried before the king. The statues, which are named in these Ne\v Kingdom scenes, include Menes, the legendary first king of the united Egypt. The oldest evidence for the royal ancestors preserve no names and shows simply the
Peristyle court of the mortuary tempk of Ra1nesses III with 1'ernnants of Osiride statues of the king. The royal mortuary temple aligned the deceased king with the gods Osiris and Re and also cekbrated the

idea of a collective group of undifferentiated but deified ancestors. 'The royal ancestors were depicted as divine beings of a high order, and the deceased king was elevated in joining their ranks. A particular aspect of the royal ancestors may be seen in the ka of the king. While the Egyptian word ka is usually translated as 'soul' or 'spirit' in general usage, the royal ka was more than just an individual spiritual 'double'. Lanny Bell, who has made detailed studies of the nature of the royal ka, has shown that it en1braced the royal ancestors as well as the living king and vvas central to the Egyptians' concept of kingly accession. As Bell has written, the aspect of divinity attained by the living Egyptian king occurred only when he became one with the royal ka at the climax of the coronation ceremony. The royal ka was, in this sense, the symbolic and spiritual point of interface between the king and his deified ancestors.
The king as Osiris
Although the Egyptian sources equatethe dea:, king with several deities, there is a clear constant emphasis throughout most of EITT history on the association of the king with the erworld god Osiris. 1'his was doubtless becau role of kingship fitted the Osiride mythologyp ularly well. Every pharaoh ceased to function a. earthly Horus - and son of Osiris - upon deaL was identified by virtue of death Virith the dea. Osiris. He thus stood as predecessor in relatl the next living king as the mythical Osiris d Horus. According to this symbolic metaphc becoming one with Osiris the dead king became ruler of the afterlife region - svvitL realms, as it were, from rule over the living t over the dead. As time progressed royal mortuary iconogrwas increasingly adapted to this equation c dead king with Osiris. We find this manifesr dozens of ways. Osiride insignia such as the \. and flail were placed on New Kingdom royalc
showing continued afterlife rulership with C despite the absence of an earthly crown in the l afterlife representations. Also, the figures of and Nephthys were placed at either end of the...



offin or sarcophagus to fulfil the role of mourning >r the deceased Osiris. The decoration of the royal 'Jmbs of the New Kingdom also stresses the fusion f the deceased king and Osiris, though to a large ,..xtent this is overshadowed by the symbolic associ~rion of the king with the sun god Re. Hovvever, ~ me scenes, such as those found on the side walls .Jnd tympana of the 19th-dynasty royal burial hambers, focus on the fusion of Osiris (who came be viewed as the mummy or corpse of Re at this -:me), the sun god, and the king.
The king as Re
-\!though the Egyptian king became one with Osiris upon death, he was also fused with the sun ~ Re. This idea is at least as old as the Osiride .ssociation and is strongly attested from the Pyramid Texts onward. The situation actually para:lels that described between the king and the 'letherworld god. Just as the living monarch was e!d to be the son of Osiris but fused with the deity upon death, so the living king known as the 'Son of
Re' could fuse with his father Re upon his entry into e afterlife. Deified queens were also frequently "-iated with the goddess Hathor (or later Isis~or)who was seen as the daughter of Re.
While the iconography associated with the body of the deceased king - i.e., the mummy, coffin, and sarcophagus - was associated prin1arily with Osiris, 11:he imagery of royal tomb decoration as seen throughout New Kingdom monuments is primarily linked with the king's assimilation with the sun god. This assimilation or fusion involves the king's cyclic travel with Re into, through, and out of the netherworld regions in continuing renewal and rebirth. The imagery of solar assimilation may be varied, however. On the one hand the god-king is said to ride alongside Re in the celestial boat of the sun god and to act as a judge in the realm of Re, while on the other hand he is clearly said to be one with the solar god. Both are depicted iconographically, the latter when the name of Ramesses III is written within a solar image in that king's tomb. In either case, however, the deceased king's divinity is clear.

Kingship Among the
Gods
It is perhaps not surprising that the Egyptian king should aspire to retain his kingly role and office in the afterlife, but there is another aspect to the phenomenon of kingship an1ong the gods. Textual and representational evidence clearly shows that the Egyptians envisioned their deities to be organized in a manner similar to human society, with the institution of kingship providing the governmental model among the gods themselves. Deities took kingly attributes and roles like those of their earthly counterparts, and the interaction between the two led to the concept of the 'king of the gods' which may have been of great importance in Egyptian theological development.
Gods as kings
Egyptian mythology is dogmatic that the institution of kingship was coeval v1ith the rule of the gods. 'f hus, the king list preserved in the Royal Canon of Turin, which dates to the 19th dynasty, begins with a dynasty of 11 deities who ruled for over 7,700 years. Through creation Re became the king of gods and men and although he eventually tired and withdrew from the world he had made, he continued to hold sovereign power as god of the heavens. On earth, the rule of Re led to a royalsuccession among the gods themselves, and in the Canon the length of the reign of each god is given before the reigns of human kings. rfhe texts state that eventually Osiris

became king of Egypt, and as the heir of Q. Horus next took over his father's king-.. However, his own rulership took on even wider mic, proportions as it was fused with the rule and with that of the ancient falcon god Horus ,vas himself originally a cosmic deity. This Je, kingship is made clear in the Coffin Texts:
'Horus.. .has become lord of the [solar] barque an inherited the sky . .. It is this Horus, the son of Isis, who rules over a heavens and the gods therein.'

Horus, in turn, became the link with the h human king. Although, according to its prir

expression in the Heliopolitan theology, this story may be understood as much as an affirmation of the king's descent from the gods as a genealogy of divine kings, we must not lose sight of the fact that from an Egyptian perspective the tnyth links kingship to the gods just as much as it establishes it by means of the gods. Hymns to the gods often name them as 'kings' especially hymns of the later New Kingdom which also give deities n1any of the epithets used of kings such as 'royal ruler' and 'ruler of the Two Lands'.

employed in the representations of the gods 1n formal and informal contexts alike. This is particularly clear in the frequent use of royal insignias by deities. Egyptian gods were often depicted seated on thrones - especially A1nun, revered as king of the gods in New Kingdom times, Re who ruled the heavens, Osiris who ruled the netherworld, and Horus. But many other deities were also depicted in this manner, and the in1age of the enthroned god or goddess is probably more commonly found in Egyptian art than exan1ples of enthroned human kings - showing the motif's importance for the portrayal of deities. Crowns are also of great importance as elements in the representation of kings and gods.

Horus, Atum and Mut, for example, vvere comn1only depicted ,vearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, while from the Third Intermediate Period youthful deities such as Ihy or Harpokrates may be shown wearing almost any of the various types of royal crowns. Likewise, royalty and deities both wore the uraeus emblem on these symbols of office and stature. Other typically royal insignias such as sceptres, staves and standards were also utilized in depictions of the gods. Although it could be argued that some of these objects were perhaps originally divine attributes utilized by the king (as for example the crook and flailof the god Andjety and later Osiris), the duality of their use still shows the interrelation of kingship and the divine roles of the gods. The parallels between divine and kingly prerogatives do not end with physical items of insignia. Just

in turn to the ancient sky god Horus, the solar god Re, the hidden god Amun or the fused Amun-Re, and briefly but nonetheless actually to Akhenaten's favoured solar disk, the Aten. In the final age of ancient Egyptian history the pre-eminent position vvas occupied by Isis, the queen of heaven - and
also, implicitly, monarch of the gods. In any period, the role of the king of the gods was a superlative one indeed, for while polytheistic religions are often viewed as lessening the in1portance of individual deities, the deity who ruled over the vast pantheon of ancient Egypt can only have been envisioned as transcendently great.

In this book, rather than simply utilizing an alphabetic listing, or attempting an arrangement of deities by their mythological roles, the many gods and goddesses included have been grouped by their appearance. This is to aid identification for the general reader and also to facilitate comparison and contrast of deities of similar types, such as leonine, bovine or serpentine gods. Even here it is impossible to create a classificatory scheme without some overlapping or ambiguity, but the system used min11n1zes redundancy and maximizes the reader's ability to view deities in useful contexts.

categories follow (with some modifications) those of the list of hieroglyphic signs printed in Sir Alan Gardiner's Middl,e Egyptian Grammar, which will be familiar to some readers and vvhich allows the location of deities without frequent recourse to the Index. The categories utilized in the catalogue are: Groups of Deities; Male Anthropomorphic Deities; Female Anthropomorphic Deities; Mammalian Deities (which are divided into several subcategories to aid identification); Avian Deities (divided into falcon deities and those represented by other avian species); Reptile, Amphibian and Fish Deities; Invertebrate and Insect Deities; and Inanimate Object Deities.

Egyptian mythology contains many groups of deities but these are of two distinct types, although they overlap occasionally. On the one hand, there exist what might be called 'numerical groups' formed from the uniting of independent deities usually related in some symbolic manner. On the other hand, many other deities - which may or may not have individual names and identities - exist only as members of generalized 'regional groups'.
NUMER I CA L GROUPINGS
Numerical groups are almost always composed of deities with distinct individual identities organized to make groups of a symbo1ica1ly significant size. Son1e of these groups, such as triads, follow the pattern of family and kinship units while others, such as enneads, are more abstract, but all are evidently symbolic in terms of the number of deities involved. In some cases the process of grouping can be seen historically as certain deities were aligned for religious or even political reasons, though in other cases deities were evidently grouped together from very early times for reasons which are not always understood.
Dyads
Deities were often grouped in pairs as the phenomenon of duality pervades Egyptian culture and is at the heart of the Egyptian concept of the universe itself - though rather than focusing on the essential differences between the two parts of a given pair,

examples of sibling dyads of the same sex such , ~he brothers Horus and Seth and the sisters Isis : \ephthys. Sometimes too, deities may be mennc::d together in pairs when their roles or areas of uence are clearly related. Thus, the lunar deities
Th :h and Khonsu, the solar deities Re and Atum, dlE nvo deified brothers Peteese and Pihor, and y others may be grouped together in this manner. rher way in which Egyptian religion formed ,ups of two deities is when two gods are utilized represent a larger group. This may be seen in 'Tlples of Thoth and Horus who are sometimes 1cted together representating the four gods of
riluaJ lustration, Horus, Seth, 1'hoth, and Nemty.
Triads

the most prominent example. The Egyptian king sometimes functioned as the divine son or represented him in such familial triads. While not all combinations of three deities represent family groupings, this is the most common form. We find evidence of deities such as Amun and Osiris going from individual and independent gods to members of fully formed triads (in these instances, ,AmunMut-Khonsu and Osiris-Isis-Horus, respectively) without any evidence of groups of two - as AmunMut or Osiris-Isis - existing between the singular deities and their triadic groupings. On the other hand some deities which coexisted in pairs did eventually form triads which were only superficially regarded as families. This was evidently the case with Ptah and Sekhmet who were worshipped
Divine pairs were often depicted with the Egyptian king as th.eir 'son', forming a family-based triad which strengthened the rel£g£ous position of both its human and divine members. Tutankhamun (centre) with Jl/Jut and Amun. 18th dynasty. Egyptian Museum, Cairo.

together at Memphis long before the god Nefertem was brought into their local grouping and the triad Ptah-Sekh1net-Nefertem was formed. Other groups of three deities may have been formed for purely symbolic reasons. The number three was an important one signifying plurality- or unity expressed in plurality - for the Egyptians, and this is probably the underlying significance of many groups such as the important New Kingdom triad of Amun, Re and Ptah. Beginning in the time of Tutankha1nun, and very commonly in Ramessid times, we find these three deities grouped by virtue of their status or importance in the pantheon.
Sometimes triads are grouped together by alone. On the sarcophagus of the 21st-dynasty Pinedjem II, three deities with the heads of a ra lion, and a jackal stand in the coils of a serpent. deities are named as Re, Isis, and Anubis respeco though a number of variants of this same l"" occur in which the gods may be depicted v,it~ heads of other animals or given other names. would seem to show that the groups are sir representative of important afterlife deities number three representing plurality rather any specific group.
Tetrads
In Egyptian symbolism the number four frequc:. signified the four cardinal directions and h a kind of spatial or geographic totality. significance is seen in the four 'races' of manl Egyptians (north), Near Easterners (east), Nub (south) and Libyans (west) depicted in some Kingdom tombs. It is also apparent in a ntr' of groupings of four deities, such as the supports of the sky which may be personifit, four individual deities or groups of deities p. 78) aligned \1/ith the four points or quarters o.
heavens. The connection is strong enough, in that even when groups of four deities do not ~ to originally have this symbolic significance it become attached to them. Thus the morn. deities known as the four sons of Horus may ~ times be aligned geographically in representan contexts although this is not always the L While the concept of completeness associated the number four may have sprung entirely frorr totality encompassed by the concept of the cardinal points, the symbolic use of the nwnh frequently one of completion without any spe, directional overtones at all. In the unden, books four forms of a given god or groups of deities are frequently found and thus depicte vignettes in the papyri and decorations of royal tombs. An interesting example of this kin tetrad is found in Ramessid times when the Seth was elevated to the extent that he was &



·imes named along with the three great deities A.mun, Re and Ptah. The four divisions of the Egyptian army were named after Seth and the ther three deities in a group which clearly could be conceived as holding the symbolism of tactical r strategic completeness. While the me1nbers of dyads and triads are usually distinguished from ne another in representational vvorks, the deities und in groups of four are often undifferentiated ,hawing their apparently more 'generic' nature.
Pentads
.\!though not a common numerical grouping of ~eiries, pentads are occasionally found in Egyptian 1~1hology. The five 'epagomenal' days added at the nd of the Egyptian year to raise the total of days
...')m360 (12 x 30-day months) to 365 were assigned .... the 'birthdays' of the deities Osiris, Isis, Horus, :--eth and Nephthys, making a distinct group of • ese related deities. In the Hermopolitan tradition ~e title 'Great of Five' was also applied to the god noth.
Hebdomads
·hiie the number six does not seem to have held .......eat syn1bolic significance for the Egyptians1 the .JI11ber seven is frequently found and, as the suin of ,ree and four, may have been believed to embody
e cvmbined significance of these two numbers ur~Jity and totality. The number seven is therere, not surprisingly, associated with deities in fferent ways. The sun god Re was said to have ~\·en bau or souls, and several other deities were nsidered to be 'sevenfold' or to have seven forms. :i-te many different manifestations of Hathor were rrequently consolidated into a more manageable and comprehensible group of seven, but the fact :at different groups of Hathors existed - com
risoo of different goddesses - shows that the
..,·enfold grouping was symbolically more impor.nt than the specific deities included. The number .50 appears in groups of different deities vvhich ere brought together. The company of gods ·ered at Abydos comprised seven gods, for exam.e. and it is also probably not coincidental that the Elber of the 42 judges who sat in the tribunal of e afterlife to judge the deceased was a multiple of ··en. The seven cows found in Chapter 148 of the 10k of the Dead also provide a good example of is kind of group. While these bovines were some-nes identified as aspects of the goddess Hathor as •,e so-called 'seven Hathors' and individually amed as 'Mansion of kas', 'Silent One', 'She of :hemnis', 'Much Beloved1
, 'She who protects', 'She hose name has power', and 'Storm in the sky', they --ually bear no clear association other than that of
their own grouping and the fact that they fulfilled a cosmic role as goddesses of fate.
Ogdoads
As four (symbolic totality) doubled, and hence intensified, the nun1ber eight is found in several groups of gods, as when the god Shu created eight Heh deities to help support the legs of the goddess Nut in her guise as the great heavenly cow. Although the names of the gods or goddesses in such groups may vary in the Egyptian texts, the fact that they always add up to eight deities shows that the concept of the group of eight was of greater importance than the specific deities which comprised the group. Ogdoads of eight deities often represent two sets of four or four sets of two gods and goddesses with the latter being more common. The greatest ogdoad - that of I-Iermopolis (see below) - provides a good example as it was composed of four pairs of primeval deities which

represented the sum of existence before creation. The Hermopolitan Ogdoad was visualized in the form of four frog-headed deities - and their four respective consorts or fema1e equivalents who were snake-headed goddesses. The nature of these deities was based on the symbolic idea of these animals as chthonic beings and as creatures associated with water and hence the prin1eval flood from which the created world emerged. The individual deities con1prising this ogdoad were:

Although the four goddesses are clearly only linguistically feminine forms of the names of the four gods, they are nevertheless seen as necessary complements of the male deities. It is also interesting that the four aspects of the primordial cosmos personified by these deities also seem to appear later in the creation account of the Hebrew Bible. Accord· ing to the various forms of the Egyptian myths) the eight beings or deities together formed the original n1ound which rose from the primordial waters, or the lotus flower, or the cosmic egg, ,~hich preceded the birth of the sun god. The main cult centre of this ogdoad was the ancient Khemnu or Kh1nun meaning 'eight town' (the modern el-Ashmunein which is also derived from the Coptic shmun 'eight') in Middle Egypt with which the god Thoth vvas also associated, so that it was later known by the Greek name Hermopolis. The Hermopolitan concept of the ogdoad was accepted throughout Egypt, however, and lVIedinet Habu in western Thebes was regarded as the 'burial place' of the eight primordial deities, a location to which the kings of Egypt can1e every ten years in the Graeco-Roman Per\Od to honour their primevalancestors.
Enneads
The Greek term ennead is the equivalent of the Egyptian pesedjet ('nine') which may refer to any group of nine gods. In the Pyramid Texts, for example, we :find the Great Ennead (PT 1655, etc.); Lesser Ennead (PT 178); Dual Ennead (PT 121, etc.); plural enneads (PT 278, etc.) and even the seven enneads



(PT 51 1). As three (plurality) multiplied by itself,
me number nine seems to have represented the cept of a great number and was used of many ups. Most commonly, the number appears in n;unct1on with the Great Ennead of Heliopolis ·ch bound together nine 'related' deities. The up consisted of Atum, the so-called 'father' the Ennead, his 'children' Shu and Tefnut, ..ndchildren' Geb and Nut, and 'greatgrandchildren' Osiris, Isis, Seth and Nephthys. A :-a""la!lt of this ennead included Horus the Elder as ,nd-born after Osiris. Although this group may ·e been constructed by the priests of Heliopolis c rder to incorporate Osiris and his related deities their ov.rn theological system in a manner :ich placed the netherworld god at a lower posi'1 than their own sun god, together the various ds of the Heliopolitan Ennead nevertheless 'llled a group of great significance. The deities "Jresented \Vere not only those of creation but also afterlife and, through Osiris and his eventual son
H rus, of the ideology and mythology of kingship. T 1us, the three areas which are arguably the most portant concepts in ancient Egyptian religion ..re contained within the Heliopolitan Ennead. Other cult centres constructed enneads of other;.se unrelated deities to which they awarded ecial veneration - as in the temple of Redesiyah :he eastern desert where Amun, Re, Osiris, Ptah,
REGIONAL GROUPINGS
Regional groups of deities - meaning those of specific areas of Egypt, or of a given area of the cosmos such as star gods or netherworld deities may or may not have individual names and identities. These groups could consist of any number of deities, and are often, in fact, of varying or indeterminate size. The category includes the deities of the hours of the day and night as these 'hour' gods and goddesses represented not only units of time but also parts of the cosmos as imagined by the Egyptians.

Cavern Deities
According to the ancient Egyptian conception of the underworld, there existed a number of caves or caverns in the nether regions which contained various deities who were involved in the punishment of the wicked. These cavern deities were systematically enumerated in the so-called 'Spell of the Twelve Caves', a composition known
from a papyrus of the time of Amenophis II (Cairo 24742), and from the warns of the southern chamber of the Osireion at Abydos. Part of this text (cave.s 8-12) was also included in the Book of the Dead since the 18th dynasty and is found as Chapter 168 in that work. l~he caverns are places of punishment and execution - usually by beheading - of the enernies of Re, but the deities in these texts also aid the justified dead. The first seven caverns contain alternating groups of three mummiform and three anthropomorphic deities, two being male and one fema1e in each group. The eighth to twelfth caverns contain varying numbers of deities with the eighth cavern having seven individuals and groups, for example, and the ninth having as many as twenty. Beneath the representations of these cavern deities, their na1nes and numbers are listed along with the offerings prescribed for them and in some cases the beneficent deeds the deities perform on behalf of the deceased, such as the ability to move freely in the underworld, or to have light, food and protection. Understandably, offerings were sometimes made by living Egyptians to these gods. The deities of the tenth cavern are representative of the types of individual and group deities found in these texts:
Deities of the tenth cavern Action performed for the deceased
Those who belong to the sunshine - give light. Those who take hold - grant that the deceased be acclaimed. The nine gods who guard those in the cavern - gi,·t'
breath of life. The nine gods whose arms are hidden - grant that· deceased be a worthy spirit.
The hidden goddess - grants that the deceased's se; strong and his corpse intact. The souls of the gods who became members of Os• grant that the deceased have peace. Those who worship Re - grant the deceased not be turned back fron1any gate of the underworld. Those whose faces are warlike - grant that the dece: be cool in the place of heat.

Demons
There is no Egyptian word which corresponds to the English word 'demon', but Egyptological literarure often uses this term to describe what are also called 'minor divinities'. From the ancient Egyptian peJspective, as Dimitri Meeks has shown, such minor deities were subordinate to the major gods and goddesses and performed specified tasks upon demand; and while the major gods tended to be more universal in nature, 'demons' were often defined by specific actions, behaviour and location. These beings vvere often associated with caves, pits and tombs and also with bodies of water - all of \vhich were considered entrances into the under\\-orld- and the greatest number of demons were, in fact, denizens of the beyond. These netherworld demi-gods constituted different categories. While some were clearly portrayed as frightening instruments of punishment for the damned, many were not inimical and may often better be classed as mjnor guardian deities such as the keepers of the various gates of the underworld. Some were crearun~s specifically tasked with the protection of the ~ing or the deceased in the journey through the netherworld. These latter demons were also capable, of course, of aggressive behaviour in order to fulfill their protective roles. Such demons may be depicted zoon1orphically but usually take human iorm or are portrayed semi-anthropomorphically \\ith hun1an bodies and the heads of creatures such as turtles, which were considered malevolent but \,·hose power could be used for protection. A number of images of such demons appear in vignettes of the afterlife books and in some of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens.
Th,e demon caUed Sahekek was depicted in the pose of a naked child with a bad headache. Demons such as
this were believed to be responsible for many ailments and illnesses. From a New Kingdom ostracon.
Demons could also be associated with the world of the living, however, and once again we find benevolent and malevolent types. rfhe latter type included den1ons associated with Sekhmet and other great deities in their aggressive aspects, while more benevolent demons were often called upon to give protection from these. Interestingly, Egyptian texts show that it was possible for a demon to be freed from its subordinate role and responsibilities and to become a 'greater god' through a process of promotion, showing once again the difference between 'demons' and 'gods' was primarily one of degree rather than type.
Gate Deities
The Egyptian conception of the underworld included 1nany gates, portals or pylons which must be passed by the sun god on his nightly journey, by the deceased king as part of the sun god's entourage (or fused with the god), and by the deceased who must pass these barriers in order to reach the place of afterlife existence. Different versions or accounts of the netherworld gates were preserved in the various funerary texts v:.rith over 1,000 deities depicted, but in all cases the barriers vvere guarded by minor gods who would allow only those who knew their secret names - and thereby had power over them - to pass.

Groups of Deities
Demons were often represented with th,e h,eads of fierce orfabulous creatures and many were depicted with weapons such as knives.

On the walls of the royal tombs of the Valley of the Kings twelve pylons or gates were commonJy incorporated into the funerary texts - such as versions of the Book of Gates - inscribed during the New Kingdom. Although each gate was depicted as an architectural feature, it was named as a goddess and protected by a fire-spitting serpent and by its own guardian deity. The fifth gate, for example, is termed 'she of duration', its serpent is called 'flameeyed' and its resident deity is 'true of heart'. In the funerary papyri composed for nobles and others there is more variation. In Chapter 144 of the Book of the Dead, for example, seven gates are mentioned, each with its own god, a doorkeeper and a herald. Thus the seventh gate is watched by the god 'sharpest of them all', the doorkeeper 'strident of voice' and the herald 'rejector of rebels'. In other texts there are 21 gates known as the 'secret portals of the mansion of Osiris in the field of reeds', each of which is given a number of names or epithets and guarded by a zoo-anthropomorphic deity usually depicted seated and holding a large knife. The names of the gates are mixed in nature, being sometimes fearsome and sometimes innocuous as with Gate 14 'mistress of anger, dancing on blood' or Gate 3 'mistress of the altar'. The guardian deities are usuaJly given terrifying or repulsive names such as 'swallower of sinners' or 'existing on maggots' in order to heighten their threatenjng effect - although in some cases they are unnamed in the texts, adding to the number of Egyptian deities known to have existed but irnpossible to catalogue.

The first of these · ities was Maat, the daughter of Re, and the others ere descendants of the sun god or his servants or clpers:

Hours of the Night Deities
Each hour of the night (corresponding to a region of the nether\vorld) was represented by a goddess who was protective or assistive in nature, with a particular role according to her position in the topography of the undenvorld. All of the goddesses strengthened the sun god in some manner until the final hour when the twelfth goddess, 'beholder of the beauty of Re', witnessed the glorious rebirth of the rejuvenated sun at the night's end. Accordingly, the hour goddesses were given po,ver by Re to control the life spans of all living things. George Hart has suggested that the ithyphal1ic figure called 'he vvho conceals the hours' that is depicted in the burial chamber of the tomb of Ramesses VI could symbolize the power desired by the n1onarch to negate the power of time that these goddesses might vvield over the deceased king. The epithets of the goddesses are as follo•vvs:
Hour Epithet
1 Splitter of the heads of Re's enemies 2 The wise, guardian of her lord 3 Slicer of souls 4 Great of povver 5 She on her boat 6 Proficient leader 7 Repeller of the snake (Apophis) 8 l\!Iistress of the night 9 Adorer 10 Beheader of rebels 11 The star, repulser of rebels 12 Beholder of the beauty of Re
The hour goddesses were not frequently depicted, but they appear in characteristically anthropomorphic form in some representations of the New Kingdom funerary texts known as the Book of Gates and the Amduat. In the burial chan1ber of the tomb of Ramesses I in the Valley of the I(ings, for example, the twelve goddesses are represented in an illustration of the third division of the Book of Gates. The goddesses stand in t\vo files, six on either side of a summary depiction of the netherworld, in the centre of which is a huge coiled serpent 'he who should be removed'. ,.fhe goddesses each ,vear a five-pointed star on their heads but are undifferentiated except for their nan1es and the alternating colours of their individual costumes.

Groups of Deities
The twelve hours of the night were personified as goddesses in the Book of Gates where they were depicted in vignettes showing the twelve deities grouped around a twisting serpent which represented the endlessness of time.

Judgment Deities (Great Tribunal, Deities of the Hall ofJustice)
References to an afterlife judgment by a tribunal of gods may appear as early as the Pyramid Texts (PT 317, 386, etc.). Such references are clear in the Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts, and by the time the Book of the Dead became the chief funerary text, this judgment was seen as the crucial event in the deceased's entrance to the afterlife. Spell 125 of the Book of the Dead gives the so-called 'negative confession' or 'declaration of innocence' of the deceased before a tribunal of 42 gods who were the assessors who judged the dead in the netherworld Hall of Justice or 'Hall of the Two Truths'. The declaration takes the form of an address by the deceased to each judge - who is named along with the protestation of innocence regarding the specific crime judged by that god. The gods were listed

Nome Deities
Egypt was traditionally divided into administra districts which the Egyptians called sepaut and Greeks nomoi, from which the word nome cor·For most of the dynastic era there were 22 Cp Egyptian provinces or nomes and in the later p ods Lower Egypt was also divided into 20 noP"" Each of these nomes had its own emblem - usu:. that of its titulary deity/deities or some other dis guishing element - which was displayed upa



pole or standard so that the names were recognized and named after their symbols, with names such as ibis, fish, or crocodile nome. In the representations carved on the walls of Egypt's temples, the names were depicted as either female or androgynous figures, usually bearing the emblems of their districts on their heads. Their
depictions show them processionally carrying offerings into the temple to signify the gifts of their areas to the upkeep and welfare of the god's houses. Usually the 22 non1es of Upper Egypt were depicted on the southern walls of temples and the 20 nomes of Lower Egypt were depicted on the northern walls.

Sons of Horus
The earliest reference to these four gods is found in the Pyramid yrexts where they are said to be the children and also the 'souls' of Horus. They are also called the 'friends of the king' and assist the deceased monarch in ascending into the sky (PT 1278-79). The same gods were also known as the sons of Osiris and were later said to be members of the group called 'the seven blessed ones' whose job was to protect the nether,,vorld god's coffin. 1'heir afterlife mythology led to important roles in the funerary assemblage, particularly in association with the containers now traditionally called canopic jars in which the internal organs of the deceased were preserved. At first the stoppers of these jars were often carved into the shape of human heads representing the head of the deceased, but from the 18th dynasty they were carved in the form of the four sons of Horus ,vho had become the patron deities of their contents. Each deity was in turnsaid to be guarded by one of the funerary goddesses, though there was some variation in this linkage. The group may have been based on the symbolic completeness of the number four alone, but they are often given geographic associations and hence became a kind of 'regional' group.

Souls of Nekhen and Pe
The sacred ancestral bau 'souls' of the Lower Egyptian city of Pe (Buto) and the Upper Egyptian city of Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) symbolized the predynastic rulers of the two regions and were regarded as powerful spirits or deities who served the deceased king and who also assisted the living king. In the Pyramid Texts the souls of Pe mourn the death of Osiris - the symbolic father of the king - and urge the vengeance of Horus - the living king - against Osiris' murderer (PT 1004--07); and the

souls of both areas are likened to stars (P'f 904) who provide a gilded '\adder' for the deceased king to climb into the sky (PT 478-79, 1253). The souls of Pe are represented as falcon-headed and those of Nekhen as jackal-headed gods. They are both often depicted in the kneeling henu or 'jubilation' position as they salute the rising sun or participate in other celebratory rituals. In the tomb of Ramesses 1in the Valley of the Kings they are shown flanking the king in this position, celebrating the rejuvenation of the king's ba or soul, as they themselves are bau or souls.

Joat of the sun god. The growth of the cult of Osiris also led to the stars being called the ·followers' of that god, so that it is clear that the n1ajor theological systems attempted to incorporate the star deities into their o,vn schemes. The brightest object in the night sky after the 1110011, the planet Venus (the 'morning star'), was vievved even from early times as an important deity; and from at least the Middle Kingdom the Egyptians recognized five of the planets which they called 'stars that know no rest' and which were represented as gods who sailed across the heavens in their own barques. These were Mercury (Sebegu, perhaps a form of Seth), Venus ('the one vvho crosses' or 'god of the morning'), Mars ('Horus of the horizon' or 'Horus the red'), Jupiter ('Horus who li:nits the Two Lands'), and Saturn ('Horus bull of the heavens'). As time progressed, 1nany of the brighter stars \Vere mapped into constellations, though these have proved extremely difficult to identify in some cases. At the least, equivalents of the modern constellations of Orion, the Great Bear, and perhaps Leo and Draco are recognizable, however; and these and other groupings represented either standard deities within the Egyptian pantheon or unique astral deities with their own identities. Already by the Middle Kingdom complex 'star-clocks' or calendars had been constructed which divided the night sky into 36 decans or groups of stars which were \·isualized as 'star gods' vvho rose and moved across the sky in the course of ten days, the most important being Sirius (Sothis - see p. 167), whose
rising approximated the beginning of the Nile's inundation. In several of the royal tombs of the Valley of the Kings - such as those of Sethos I and Ramesses VI - the night sky is depicted on the ceiling of the burial chamber and many of the important star deities are represented and named. At this time many familiar deities - such as the four sons of Horus - also appeared as star gods.

Amenophis Son of Hapu
Mythology
Amenophis Son of Hapu was born in the Delta town of Athribis c. 1430 BC and rose to distinction as a royal scribe and overseer of all the king's works under Amenophis III. He appears to have moved to the royal court at Thebes in about 1390 BC and lived there until a man of venerable age, having directed the construction of some of the greatest architectural wonders produced in ancient Egypt. Amenophis' works included not only the planning and construction of great monuments in the area of Thebes - such as the mortuary temple of Amenophis III and its great Colossi of Memnon but also the temple of Soleb in Nubia and temples in other areas of the realm. Accorded great honour during his lifetime, after his death Amenophis was deified for his wisdom and in later periods for his healing powers. In these roles he was paired during Ptolemaic times, in Thebes at least, with Imhotep, the legendary 3rd-dynasty architect of Djoser.
Iconography
As a deified person Amenophis Son of Hapu was depicted only in human form. During his lifetime several granite statues were set up showing him as a scribe in the temple of Amun at Karnak (fine examples are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the Luxor Museum) and he appears in a beautifully carved scene in the tomb of his relative, the vizier Ramose, at Thebes. The Son of Hapu lived to be 80 years old, and a statue of him as an elderly official survives.
Worship
Unlike the more widely spread veneration of Imhotep, the worship of Amenophis Son of Hapu was limited mainly to the Theban area and can be seen to have grown in two stages. Even in his lifetime his importance led to the erection of a funerary cult temple next to that of Amenophis III on the west bank of Thebes. While small compared to the te1nple of the king, Amenophis' own monument was still of considerable size and larger than the temples of some kings in the same
area. It was also the only private cult temple sin.. among the royal monuments in this location.•.\ _ dynasty copy of a royal decree pertaining tothe of Hapu's temple indicates that his cult continl..L.. be celebrated for at least three centuries a~er death. The veneration of the deified Amenoph a god of wisdom and healing also saw a resurg in the Ptolemaic Period. Together with lmh chapels were dedicated to him in the templ,Hathor at Deir el-Medina and in Hatshep-temple at Deir el-Bahri. The statues erected for in the temple of Amun at Karnak vvere also uri' as intermediaries with Amun, and prayers offered to them.
Amun, Amun-Re
Mythology
One of the most important gods of ancient EgAmun is first mentioned, along with his con Amaunet, in the Pyramid Texts (PT 446). appears as a local god of the Theban region fro"' least the 11th dynasty when four rulers took name Amenemhet or 'Amun is pre-eminent'. v\1~ a century and a half Amun gradually displaced old god of that region, Montu, and the ascenda: of the Theban kings in Middle and New Kingct times eventually propelled him (as the combi: Amun-Re) to the position of supreme god of Egyptian pantheon. He was associated with other deities who together made up the local di\ triad of Thebes:his consort, the goddess l\llut - , largely replaced An1aunet in this role - and lunar god Khonsu who was worshipped as their (see illus. pp. 31, 47). His character developed c the 1nillennia into that of a rich and varied persor ity. The Egyptians themselves called him A11 asha renu or 'Amun rich in names', and the god C" only be fully understood in terms of the rna. aspects which were combined in him.
Concealed god: The Greek writer Plutarch quo: the Egyptian chronicler Manetho as stating d Amun meant 'that which is concealed' or 'invisib and the god was also commonly given epithets st. as 'mysterious of form' - suggesting an essentia imperceptible nature - and it is possible that ' name originally referred to Amun as the invisir power of the wind. While it is true that his nar was written without a defining determinative, t:. was also true of some other creator gods, but r.:. aspect of Amun as a mysterious, hidden god \\. primary to his nature.
Creator god: In addition to being a member of r. Ogdoad, the group of eight primeval deit worshipped in Hermopolis (see p. 77), Amun \\worshipped as Amun kematef or 'Amun who h;.. completed his moment', a creator god in the fonn



a snake which renewed itself. In this form Amun \vas said to predate the other members of the Ogdoad, and it was probably this form of Amun that Plutarch refers to as 'Kneph' - an eternal, selfengendering god worshipped by the inhabitants of Thebes. By the 18th dynasty Karnak Temple was said to occupy the 'mound of the beginning' where _-\mun brought the world into being; and a number of ew Kingdom hymns extol Amun for creating the cosmos through his thoughts, an important step
in the theological development of cosmogonic ideas.
Solar god: In the Dook of the Dead An1un is called
'eldest of the gods of the eastern sky', an epithet reflecting both his primeval character and solarassociated nature, and an 18th-dynasty hymn to Amun preserved on a stela in the British Museum refers to A.mun when he rises as Horakhty (seep. 201), directly fusing the hidden one with the visible sun. When he
was syncretized with the god Re, as the composite Amun-Re, Amun took on a nurnber of aspects of the solar deity, though these were clearly secondary to his hidden nature and the god was regarded as antithetical to the sun during the Amarna Period.
Fertility god: From the 12th dynasty, Amun kamutef - literally, 'bull of his mother' - was the ithyphallic form of Amun depicted in ritual scenes in the temples of Thebes and especially Luxor Ten1ple. The epithet suggests both that the god was selfengendered - meaning that he begot himself on his
rnother, the cow who personified the goddess
of the sky and of creation - and also conveys the sexual energy of the bull which, for the Egyptians, was a symbol of strength and fertility par excellence. In this ithyphallic aspect Amun was related to the fertility god Min (see p. 115) and is sometin1es called Amun-Min.
The great god Amun-Re depicted in both his normal
anthropomorphic form (second from right} and as the ithyphallic Amun-Min (at kft}. Amun was venerated in a number of roles but his identity as king of the gods and as a powerful
fertility god were of primary importance in New Kingdom times. 19th dynasty. Temple of Sethos I, Abydos.

Warrior god: It seems likely that some of the character of the old Theban war god 1\/lontu (see p. 203), whom Amun largely displaced, was absorbed by the ascendant deity. The Theban rulers of the 13th dynasty had made their city a rallying point against the invading Hyksos and, when the Hyksos were finally driven from Egypt (c. 1550 BC), it was Amun who received credit for the military victories of the time. Likewise, in the succeeding period of Nevv Kingdom Empire Amun \vas not only said to instigate Egyptian expansion and to protect the Egyptian king in battle, but the 'lord of victory' and 'lover of strength' was specifically given credit for successful military strategy.
King of the gods: Pyramid Text 1540 states 'you
have come, 0 king, as the son of Geb upon the throne of Amun', and from the Middle Kingdom the god was styled 'Lord of the thrones of the Two Lands' of Upper and Lower Egypt. The firs t known example of Amun's title 'king of the gods' appears on the 12th-dynasty 'White Chapel' of Senv,osret I at Karnak and is used frequently thereafter. He was also called 'chief of the gods' in this same role of
divine king. By Ptolemaic times Amun was d:equated with Zeus, and his Greek name Arr sonther may be based on the Egyptiar Amun-Re nesu netcheru, 'Amun-Re king gods'.
Universal god: Unlike deities who vvere thou1-. personify the sky, earth or some other limited r or phenomenon, Amun was held to be a uni, god \vho, at least in his developed theolo&) meated the cosmos and all it contained. \i\Th\le, other gods could be said to be 'universal' in n:: it is with A1nun that we find a developed rat for this claim.

Iconography
Usually Amun was represented in human . wearing a short kilt (to which is often attac!"
bull's tail), a feather pattern tunic and a do plumed crown. It has been suggested that the&



feathers were a way of representing Amun as a god of the wind - either as it could be seen ruffling the feathers or as it might be generated by feather fans - though this is purely speculative.1'he twin feathers would seem to reflect some aspect of the basic dualism which pervades Egyptian symbolism, and each feather was itself also frequently divided into the significant number of seven sections. Anthropon1orphic images of Amun are found in two forms with red and blue skin. The god's original colour \.vas red, like that of most other gods, but after the Amarna Period (and apparently in some instances before), the god was also shown with a blue complexion, possibly in order to symbolize his aspects as a deity of the air and of primeval creativity. In depictions of the god standing, An1un is usually shown in a striding pose, though in his form of Amun-Min he stands with legs together, and as befitting his position as king of the gods, A111un is frequently also depicted seated on a throne. Probably because of its procreative vigour, the ram (ovis platyra aegyptiaca - recognized by its curved horns) could symbolize A111un. The processional routes which led to Amun's chief temple at
I , 1)
Karnak were flanked with prone rams or ramheaded lions symbolizing the god, and the great festival barque of Amun 'lord of the two horns' was decorated ,vith ra111s' heads at its prow and stern. Occasionally, Amun is depicted as a man with the head of a ram, a form easily confused vvith that of the evening form of the sun god. The Nile goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca) was also a symbol of Amun, probably because of its association with the creation of the prin1eval \Vorld (see Gengen-Wer); and for the same reason Amun also could be depicted as a serpent, though the iconographic use of this form is rare. Finally, in his solar-related form, combined with Re, Amun could also be associated with the lion, and the criosphinxes which represented him as ram-headed lions must be understood in this way.
Worship
Although of great importance at 1'hebes during the Middle Kingdom, relatively little is known of the worship of Amun before the New Kingdom when the god rose to the position of supreme state god. The monuments which were built to him at that time were little short of astounding and An1un was worshipped in many temples throughout Egypt, though in 1'hebes itself, on the east bank of the Nile, two temples in particular were greatly enlarged in his honour. The main temple of Amun at Karnak called by the Egyptians Jpet-isut ('most select of places') - remains the largest religious structure ever created and consisted of a vast enclosure containing Amun's own temple as well as several subsidiary temples of other gods. 1'his complex was connected via a processional way with Jpetresyt, the 'southern sanctuary' of Lu:x:or Temple

vvhich the god visited annually in the 'Beautiful Fes
tival of Opet'. In this most important of Amun's festivals, the god's cult statue was taken to his southern temple to celebrate union with his divine consort Mut in the form of the ithyphallic Amun of Luxor who appeared in the guise of the fertility god Min. On the western bank of 1'hebes Amun also had smaller but theologically important cult areas in the temples of Deir el-Bahri, Medinet Habu and elsewhere that were also visited by the god in festival processions which crossed the Nile and travelled from one shrine to the next. In the New Kingdon1 and later Amun was incorporated into many Lower Egyptian centres, notably at Perunefer (the river port of Memphis) in the 18th dynasty, at PerRamesses in the 19th, and on a vast scale at Tanis in the eastern Delta where Karnak was almost virtually recreated during the 21st dynasty. As a result of royal gifts following successful military campaigns during the New Kingdom and other sources of income, tremendous wealth flowed into the Theban cult centre of Amun, so that by the time of Akhenaten (c. 1353 BC) it is clear that the priesthood of Amun held a vast share of the wealth - and doubtless power - in Egypt. Whether this fact affected the religious revolution attempted by Akhenaten to any degree is unclear, but Amun certainly suffered the brunt of Akhenaten's religious 'reform', the names and images of the god being zealously erased from temples throughout Egypt. In the period of restoration which followed the Amarna interlude the prestige and power of Amun were rapidly regained. By the time of Ramesses III Amun's holdings extended to a full one-third of the cultivable land in Egypt; and by the close of the New Kingdom the first priest of Amun was powerful enough to rival the contemporary pharaohs who ruled from the north. During the 21st dynasty a practice had been established in which the daughter of the reigning king was consecrated to Amun as the 'divine wife of Amun', a custom which helped maintain the balance between Egypt's earthly rulers and her divine king. The Kushite kings of the 25th dynasty continued this practice, and their rule actually led to a resurgence in the vvorship of An1un as the Nubians had accepted the god as their own. Even after the invading Assyrians sacked Thebes in 663 BC, Amun still held great sway in the religion of Egypt; the god was sought out and honoured by Alexander the Great and, under the name of ZeusAmmon, continued to be worshipped throughout the Greek and Roman Periods. The worship of Amun also extended to the nonformal veneration of popular religion. The god \vas regarded as an advocate of the common man, being called 'the vizier of the humble' and 'he who con1es at the voice of the poor' (seep. 51), and as 'Amun of the Road' he was also regarded as the protector of travellers. Most amulets of the god do not seem to predate the 'Third Intermediate Period but are often
made of expensive materials and seem to have been worn in life, perhaps by the priests in his service. The god was well represented in the spells and charn1s of Egyptian magic and seems to have been especially regarded as a god who cured eye ailments. His power was also invoked in spells against scorpions, crocodiles and other dangerous creatures.
Andjety
Mythology
The god Andjety (Egyptian 'he of Andjet') was the local god of the 9th Lower Egyptian nome (see Nome Deities) centred at Busiris, the ancient Andjet or Djedu in the Delta. The deity seems to have been one of the precursors of Osiris in the sense that he was eventually absorbed by that god who took over his attributes and characteristics (see Osiris). In the Pyramid Texts he is one of the gods with whom the deceased king is identified, and juxtaposed with Anubis, ruler of the west as 'Andjety who presides over the eastern nomes' (PT 220, 1834). Judging by his insignia (see below) and the earliest textual evidence, it is possible that Andjety may have originally been a locally deified dead king of Busiris or somehow personified the concept of rulership. Andjety also had clear fertility aspects. Even in the Pyramid Texts we find the substitution of a stylized uterus for the two feathers in the writing of the name of Andjety which probably reflects these aspects in some way, and in the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom Andjety is also given the epithet 'bull of vultures', doubtless based on a mythological role as the consort of several early goddesses.
Iconography
Andjety was worshipped in anthropomorphic form, apparently as a deified ruler, and his iconography clearly demonstrates his influence on Osiris. From the beginning of the 4th dynasty he was depicted wearing a high conical crown decorated with two feathers very similar to the Atef Crown later worn by Osiris. Andjety also held two sceptres - a crook and flail - which likewise became Osirian insignia (see illus. p. 121).
Worship
The assimilation of Andjety by Osiris at an early date precludes a clear picture of the worship of the former god, but Andjety's position in the Pyramid Texts indicates a wide-ranging influence and worship of the deity in Lower Egypt in early times. He did continue as an independent deity after the rise of Osiris, but the two gods are seldom far removed in later times and from New Kingdom times may be combined, as in the funerary temple of Sethos l at Abydos where the king is depicted presenting

incense to Osiris-Andjety - a clear fusion of Osiris with the deity who was perhaps his most important forerunner.
Arensnuphis
Mythology
An anthropomorphic deity of Meroitic Nubia, Arensnuphis' origins are unclear, but the god seems to have been indigenous to the area to the south of Egypt. Unfortunately, the Egyptian interpretation of his na1ne as Iry-hemes-nefer - 'the good companion' - suggests only a benign deity, and provides no real indication of his origins or essential nature. In the temple of Arensnuphis at Philae the god is called the 'companion' of Isis, but this title does not seem to be based in any mythological background. It is more important that he v,ras equated vvith the Egyptian gods Onuris and Shu, sometimes being merged with the latter as the syncretic deity Shu-Arensnuphis.
Iconography
Arensnuphis was usually depicted in the form of a man wearing a feathered crown, sometimes holding a spear. His association with Shu (see p. 129) and Onuris (see p. 118) probably led to similarities of iconography shared by these gods. Arensnuphis could also be depicted in the form of a lion, though in this form he may not be distinguishable from other lion gods.
Worship
The cult of Arensnuphis is first attested in Nubia at Musawvvarat el-Sufra east of the Nile's sixth cataract in the 3rd century BC. The god's worship spread into Egyptian Nubia during the Graeco-Ron1an Period, and a small kiosk was jointly built and decorated for him on the island of Philae by Ptolemy IV (c. 221- 205 BC) and the Meroitic king Arqamani (c. 218-200 BC). Arensnuphis was also depicted in the temple of Dendur near the first cataract of the Nile where he is shown worshipped by the Roman emperor Augustus.
Ash
Mythology
The name Ash cannot be analyzed as Egypti2.. the god is often thought to be of foreign origin ertheless, Ash appears to have been an ancien and is first attested on seals and inscription Early Dynastic Period. He was venerated as tlt of Egypt's western desert region, including th lying oases and the area of Libya or 'Tehenu this gave the god a somewhat dual nature as h associated both with the barren desert region~ at the same time, with the fertile oases.

Atum
Mythology
Atum was the great primeval deity of Heliop His cult was a very ancient one and by the Kingdom he had risen to a very high leYe in1portance in Heliopolitan theology. Atum i$



of the eight or nine most frequently mentioned gods in the Pyramid Texts and we thus have a good deal of early information regarding the god's mythological roles and characteristics. I·Iis most essential nature is that of the 'self-engendered one' ,v~10 arose at the beginning of tin1e and \.vho created the first gods through his semen - or, according to another story, through his saliva (see p. 17). Atum h.ad many other facets, however. The word tem on ,vhich the name of the god is founded means ·complete' or 'finish' in both constructive and destructive senses, and this range of meanings fi ts· well with a number of aspects of the god's nature.
Lord of totality: Atum was the monad - the one from \.vhom all else originally came. One of the ,vays in which his name n1ight be translated carries the idea of 'totality', and in the Coffin Texts and elsewhere he is specifically called the 'lord of totality' (CT III 27). From this perspective, everything which existed was a part of the 'flesh' of _-\tum, and every individual thing was said to be one of the millions of the god's kas, a concept which not only stressed the god's primacy in coming before all else but also his importance as a universal god. By means of the magical formulae contained in the Pyramid Texts, the deceased king hoped to unite with Atum and thus become one with the
supreme deity (P'f 147).
Creator: According to the Heliopolitan cosmogony (see p. 17), Atum \.vas god of the creative principle ,:1..1hereby the world was created from primeval chaos. In the Pyramid Texts the god was 'he who came into being' of himself (P'f 1248), and this independence of prior causality was what allowed hi1n to exist as creator. Atum's creative nature has tvvo sides to it, however, because Atum can be seen as the one who completes everything and finishes everything. In this sense he is the uncreator as well as the creator.Thus, in the Book of the Dead, Atum states that at the end of the world he will dlestroy everything he has made and return to the form of the primevalserpent (BD 175).
A tum in serpent form and as - or wdh - the young sun. The god's primal aspect gave him associations both with
creatures such as the snake and the image of the newly born sun. Papyrus, Brooklyn 1Wuseum of Art.
Father of the gods and the king: As the creator god Atum was the father of Shu and Tefnut, the first divine couple, and hence 'father of the gods' (PT 1521, 1546). According to the viewpoint of Egyptian mytho logy Atum copulated with hin1self to
produce the first divine pair (P1' 1248--49), with the hand utilized by the god in this act representing a personification of the female principle inherent within himself. Because the 'family tree' envisaged by the Heliopolitan theologians led from the god through Shu and rfefnut eventually to Osiris and his son Horus (seep. 18), Atum vvas also the genealogical father of the Egyptian king, and the Pyran1id Texts make clear the father-son relationship was held to be a close one even from early times: 'O Atum, raise this king up to you, enclose him within your embrace, for he is your son of your body for ever' (PT 213).
Pri1nal mound: Atum was not only viewed as the creator but also the original creation itself. He vvas thus the primeval mound which rose from the waters of creation and was represented in this aspect by the sacred ben-ben stone, which was worshipped at Heliopolis from the earliest dynasties and which may have originally been a meteorite or some other sacred stone.
The sun: Because the sun \vas regarded as a primary factor in the process of creation Atum was also linked to solar religion as the 'self-developing

scarab' (P'f 1587) who represented the newly created sun. In fact, in the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts Atum is often fused with the sun god as Re-Atum. When Re and Atum are viewed separately, Re is usually the rising sun of the day and Alum is the setting sun of the evening, but this is not always the case. In the Coffin Texts he is specifically said both to 'emerge from the eastern horizon' and to 'rest in the western horizon', so that he is in this way the complete sun. In funerary contexts, however, Atum was certainly more commonly the aged form of the sun which set each evening and travelled through the underworld before being reborn the following day. As such he plays an important role in many of the later mortuary books.
Chthonic god: As a primeval god and as the evening sun Atum had strong chthonic and underworld connections. His power is thus invoked in many netherworld scenarios. In the funerary books inscribed on the walls of the New Kingdom royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings, Atum is shown as an aged, ram -headed figure who supervises the punishment of evildoers and enemies of the sun god, and also subdues hostile netherworld forces such as the serpents Apophis and Nehebu-Kau. In non-royal funerary texts Atum also provides protection for the deceased from netherworld dangers.
Iconography
Atum is most frequently represented in anthropon1orphic form and is usually depicted in this manner wearing the dua1 crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. He may also be represented with the head of a ram, though this is more usual in depictions showing his solar or underworld aspects. The god is often depicted seated on a throne and vvhen standing he may be shown standing erect or, to stress his aged aspect, leaning on a staff. Zoomor

phically, Atum could be represented or symbolized as a serpent in reference to his chthonic and primeval nature, and also, in other aspects, as a mongoose, lion, bull, or lizard, and as an ape - sometimes in this latter guise armed with a bow with which he shoots his enemies. In terms of his solar connections he may be depicted as a scarab, and the famous giant scarab statue which novv stands by the sacred lake at Karnak was dedicated to Atum. Yet again, in terms of his primeval nature, Atum could also be represented by the image of the primeval hill, and in the First Intermediate Period 'Atum and his hand' appear as a divine couple.
Worship
Atum was perhaps the most important god originally worshipped at Heliopolis, although his cult was eventually eclipsed by that of Re (seep. 205). Atum retained a good deal of his importance, however. The god is often called 'Lord of Heliopolis', and even after the rise of Re his influence continued to be exerted in the solar cult centre. Atum's importance was by no means limited to the north, or to the Old Kingdom, however. It is Atum, along with the Theban god Montu, who escorts the king in New Kingdom representations in the temple of Amun at Karnak. Atum's close relationship with the Egyptian king is seen in many cultic rituals, and a papyrus dating to the Late Period in the Brooklyn rvruseum shows the god's importance in the New Year's festival in which the kjng's role was reconfirmed. Atum is relatively rarely encountered in the popular religion of ancient Egypt, but amulets and small reliquaries of lizards - which were one of his symbols - were worn in honour of the god in the Late Period.
Baal
Mythology
Baal was the West Semitic storm god, the equivalent of the Amorite deity Adad or Hadad, and the centrally important deity of the Canaanites. The Hebre\v Bible records the ancient Israelites apostasizing interaction with this god, and Late Bronze Age texts found at Ras Shamra (the ancient Ugarit) on the Levantine coast show that by c. 1400 BC Baal had displaced the god El to become the most pron1inent deity in the local pantheon. Believed to be active in storms, he was known as 'rider of the clouds' and 'lord of heaven and earth'; he also controlled the earth's fertility. According to the surviving ancient Near Eastern myths, Baal vanquished Ya1n, the tyrannical god of the sea, but was eventually himself overcome by Mot, a personification of death, and descended into the underworld. Baal returned to life with the help of his sisterconsort Anat in a manner similar to the death and resurrection of Osiris; and although the two gods
do not seem to have been directly connected in Egypt, the similar background may well have aided Baal's acceptance there. His bellicose nature as god of storms meant that he was naturally equated with the Egyptian god Seth, and Ramesses II himself was said to appear at the Battle of Kadesh like Seth and 'Baal himself'.
Iconography
Usually represented in anthropomorphic form, Baal was depicted as a powerful warrior, with long hair and a full, slightly curved Syrian-style beard. .He wore a conical, funnel-like helmet with two horns attached at its base and often carried a straight

bladed sword at the belt of a short kilt. The god was also often depicted grasping a cedar tree club or spear in his left hand and a weapon or thunderbolt in his upraised right hand. This imagery is comn1on to many Near Eastern storm gods and n1ay have been the origin of the later iconography of the Greek god Zeus. Baal's cult animal was the bull symbolizing his power and ferti1ity - and in Near Eastern art he is frequently depicted standing on the back of a bull.
Worship
By the 18th dynasty Baal worship had penetrated Egypt, and the god was formally served at several sites, an important cult centre being located at Baal Saphon near Peluseum in the northern Delta. He was also popular at Memphis and in several other areas, his popularity being attested in Egyptian theophoric names during New Kingdom and later times.
Ba-Pef
God of uncertain nature, though probably a deity of pain or woe, Ba-Pef means simply 'that soul', but the use of the non-specific name implies fear or taboo of mentioning the god's real name. In the Pyramid Texts the netherworld house of Ba-Pef 'wherein is vvoe' is mentioned, but no other details are given. There is some evidence of a priesthood of Ba-Pef in Old Kingdom times (in the tomb of Meresankh III at Giza), though the god does not seem to have been of great importance in any period.
Bes
Mythology
The name Bes (perhaps from the word besa, 'to protect') is a relatively late term used to describe what are really a nun1ber of deities and demons of Egypt, perhaps not all originally related, though all of similar form. Perhaps ten separate gods - Aha, Amam, Bes, Hayet, Ihty, Mefdjet, Menev.,, Segeb, Sopdu and Tetetenu - share similar, if not identical, characteristics making 'Bes' a con1plex and not always clearly understood figure. Although the developed deity came to be one of the most popular and widespread of Egyptian gods, little can be said with certainty of his beginnings. In the past different scholars have assigned hin1 both African and Near Eastern roots, but this is unnecessary and the god is attested in Egypt - if somewhat indirectly since Old Kingdom times. He (or related deities such as Aha: 'fighter') appears on scores of artifacts of Middle Kingdom date, but it is not until the Ne,v Kingdom and later that Bes figures and images become truly widespread and reflect popular acceptance of the developed deity.
Despite his appearance, which changed in rr details over time, Bes was dee1ned beneficer humans and he was accepted by all classe-Egyptians as a powerful apotropaic deity. He especially associated with the protection of dren and of pregnant women and those giving b and often depicted alongside Taweret in this r Just as the Bes figure subsumed various minor tand demons, in later times he was hin1self ..syr tized with other protective deities, forming the ·cof a composite deity whose elements inch...

Iconography
While the appearance of the god has been cpared with models as diverse as African pygrr and vvith prehistoric Libyan images,Jan1es Rom de1nonstrated a number of years ago that the or of the Bes iconography is most likely to be foun the image of a male lion rearing up on its hind pa Later aspects of the deity - from Nev., Kingd times - also display characteristics of achene plastic dwarfism so that in his developed form god is usually portrayed as dwarf-like with sh ened legs and an enlarged head which is usu... depicted from the front in two-dimensional re.... sentations.

god wore a lionskin cape rather than physically possessing these characteristics. After the New Kingdom Bes is someti111es depicted wearing the leopard skin worn in certain ritual contexts. For n1uch of his history Bes is also frequently depicted \vearing a plumed headdress and he is often given a large belly and sometirnes protruding breasts probably tying him to his role as a patron and protector of pregnant women. Because Bes was believed to provide protection from snakes, he is frequently depicted holding or biting serpents, and in this form he assimilated, or \vas himself an avatar of, the demon Aha who strangled serpents in his bare hands. Representations of Bes also commonly carry musical instruments, knives, or the hieroglyphic sa sign signifying protection, as these attributes all reinforced the god's protective nature. Unlike other representa~ions of the god, those showing him dancing with musical instruments or with snakes frequently ::how him in profile view as was necessary for indicating movement. From the Third Intermediate Period on, images of }ust the head or mask of Bes occur both as independent amulets and as parts of other compositions the povver of the mask alone being clearly considered to be sufficient for protective purposes. Conversely, in his later composite forn1 Bes is depicted as the head and sometimes body of a fourarmed, winged and many-headed god with the tail of a falcon and the attributes of many of the deities with ,vhom he was combined. In the Graeco-Roman Period images of the god sometimes carry a sword and circular shield to heighten his protective qualities or perhaps because he was adopted as a military deity. The effect is heightened in Roman
times when he is sometimes shown wearing the full costume of a legionary.
Worship
Although not worshipped in any formal temple
cult, Bes was widely venerated as a protective deity in the later dynastic periods of Egyptian history. The image of the god protected the 1nammisi or
Faience image of Bes ho/,ding an infant in his role as protector of childbirth. The tallplumed crown of the god is common in his iconography from the 18th dynasty. Harer Collection, San Bernardino.

birth houses of temples in the Graeco-Roman Period and perhaps earlier, and the figure of Bes has also been found painted in rooms ranging from the palace of Amenophis III at Malqata to the workmen's houses at Deir el-Medina - perhaps all being rooms associated \Vith childbirth or children. The vast range of objects upon which Bes was depicted and the large number of his images and amulets demonstrate his great popularity as a household deity. His image was incorporated into je\velry and his amulets were worn in life, and the god is frequently depicted on headrests and beds,

Dedwen
Mythology
Originally a Nubian deity, Dedwen was known in Egypt from at least Old Kingdom times when the king is identified with 'Dedwen, who presides over \!ubia' in the Pyramid Texts (PT 994, 1476). At a very early date Dedwen had come to represent not only Nubia but also its resources, and especially incense - which was imported into Egypt from the ~outh. The god vvas thus identified as thesupplier of incense for the gods and was also said to burn incense at royal births (P'r 803, 1017).
Iconography
Depicted anthropomorphically, Dedwen was portrayed as a male deity, usually with no special characteristics and sometimes differentiated only by nan1e. In the Old I<ingdom his name was sometimes written with the hieroglyphic sign for a certain type of bird, but the god himself was not depicted in avian form or vvith the head of a bird. At Kalabsha Dedwen is depicted with the head of a lion, and the god could also be assi1nilated to Amun or Khnum in the form of a ram.
Worship
Apart from his association (through incense) with the cults of Egyptian gods and kings, the worship of Dedwen seems to have remained largely limited to Nubia itself. However, the god was honoured in many pharaonic temples built in Nubia. Dedvven vvas included, for example, with other deities in a small temple built by Tuthmosis III at el-Lessiya; and on the island of Uronarti near Semna, a temple (perhaps of Middle Kingdom origin) vvas dedicated to Dedwen and Senwosret III by Tuthmosis. A Late Ptolemaic granite chapel at Kalabsha, re-erected in the 1960s on the new site just south of Aswan, was also dedicated to Dedwen.

Geb
Mythology
A third-generation deity, the son of Shu and Tefnut, Geb was the god who personified the earth and was one of the n1ost important of Egypt's primeval gods. His stature since early times is seen in the fact that he is one of the most frequently mentioned deities found in the Pyramid Texts, where he is often juxtaposed with Re or other gods who v:.rere of great importance in Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The god's power was sometimes inimical. Earthquakes came of his laughter and he could withhold his blessings in dry times or in barren areas. More importantly, as god of the earth par excellence, Geb could also represent the grave and it is stated in the Pyramid Texts, for example, that the deceased king 'will not enter into Geb' or 'sleep within his house' (PT 308). Geb usually had a n1ore beneficent aspect, however. As god of the earth, grain was said to sprout from his ribs and vegetation from his back. He was also the source of fresh waters and ultimately all that the earth produced so that Geb was directly associated with the fertility of both the earth and livestock; and Hapy, bountiful god of the Nile inundation, was said to be the 'friend of Geb'. As the son of Atum and Shu, Geb was the 'heir of the gods', and as father of Osiris, the mythical king, Geb also maintained a strong association with kingship. The Egyptian king himself was called the 'heir of Geb' and was said to sit upon 'the seat of Geb'. The god was thus involved in the transmission of kingship, and in the mythical story known as the 'Contendings of Horus and Seth' (preserved in the 20th-dynasty Papyrus Chester Beatty I), it is Geb who acts as the presiding judge in determining the rightful heir to the throne. This role of support for the king is present even as early as the Pyramid Texts where Geb champions the king as Horus over Seth.

106
The late tradition, unattested before the 30th dynasty, that Geb lusted after his own mother and violated her upon his father's death, appears to have been based on the Greek myth of the usurpation of the place of Ouranos by his son Chronos whom the Greeks identified directly with Geb.
Iconography
As with other cosmic deities Geb was usually represented anthropomorphically. He may be depicted as a man wearing the crown of Lower Egypt, or in terms of his mythological role, reclining on his side supporting himself with one arm beneath the personified sky. In such scenes his phallus may be shown stretching upwards toward the goddess Nut, signifying their relationship. Geb's mythological associations meant that he could also be represented as a white-fronted goose (a creature associated with creation), however, or as a man with a goose on his head, and in the tomb of Ramesses VI Geb is represented vvith the head of a hare. In any of his forms Geb may be depicted with green skin in order to symbolize his fertile nature and the vegetation which springs from him, and in some cases his body is decorated with plants.
Worship
Although not honoured with a major cult of his own, Geb was represented in many temple scenes
and was also important in some aspects of popular religion. The god was associated with healing and was particularly invoked in spells combating scorpion stings. His healing powers were wideranging, and one magical text describes hovv Osiris

applied to many of the gods who represented aspects of fertility and primeval creation.
Iconography
Representations of Hapy usually show the god as a svvollen-bellied man wearing an abbreviated belt or loincloth and with long hair and pendulous, female breasts. Often, the god was depicted with a clump of papyrus upon his head, and he is frequently shown carrying papyrus and lotus stems and bearing a tray laden with offerings. Most often he was shown vvith blue skin, though other colours are occasionally found. All of these attributes represented the fertility Hapy supplied and as such were interchangeable with those of other so-called fecundity figures (seep.131). Beginning in the 5th dynasty (in the mortuary temple of Sahure), the lower registers of temple walls were often decorated with depic
tions of I-Iapy and other fecundity figures bearing offerings into the temple as gifts and sustaining supplies for the temple's divine owners. Statues showing Hapy bearing loaded offering trays were also made - sometimes with the features of the reigning king, thus linking the monarch with the fecundity deity. Beginning in the 19th dynasty, reliefs portraying tvvo figu res of Hapy, one wearing the papyrus of Lower Egypt and the other the heraldic plant of Upper Egypt, and binding together the two halves of Egypt (symbolized by the respective plants being used as ropes around the sema or 'union' hieroglyph) were often carved on temple walls and on the bases of colossalseated statues of kings. An instance of Hapy depicted with the double head of a goose appears in the temple of Sethos I atAbydos.

Worship
Hapy was especially worshipped in areas where the Nile was particularly turbulent such as Gebel elSilsila and near the supposed source of the Nile where the god was believed to dwell in a cavern in the vicinity of Aswan. Although it was said of Hapy that 'he has no shrines, nor portions, no service of his choice' (The Hymn to Hapy), he was widely venerated outside his cult centres and frequently depicted in the temples of other deities. One text, relating how 1,089 goats were sacrificed to Hapy, shows something of his importance. Many Egyptians celebrated the god's annual festival and composed hymns and paeans of praise to him.
Hauron
Mythology
The Canaanite god Hauron was a son1ewhat obscure deity of the desert and the earth, perhaps,
according to Canaanite mythology, a son of Astarte. Hauron may have been a god associated with herdsmen and those who wandered the desert areas; in Egypt he was known as 'the victorious herdsman'. He is attested in Egyptian texts from Middle Kingdom times in the form of a Canaanite theophoric name, but the appearance of Hauron as an adopted Egyptian deity seems to date to around the time of Amenophis II at the earliest. The god was associated with the Great Sphinx at Giza, but the reason for the equation is not clear. Perhaps it was as a result of the presence of Canaanite or Syrian workers who were located in the area of the Sphinx, or it may have been as a result of some mythological connection which is no longer evident.
Iconography
Hauron was usually depicted in anthropomorphic forn1 as an armed man, but he could also appear in other ways. In a famous statue in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo the god is represented in the forn1



of a falcon standing behind and protecting the crouching figure of Ramesses II who is shown as a child.
Worship
A temple or chapel of this god, the 'house of Hauron', was constructed in front of the Great Sphinx at Giza in New Kingdom tin1es. Hauron also obviously entered Egyptian popular religion in his capacity of divine herdsman, as a spell to be cast over a field is known which invokes a number of deities - including Hauron - to protect cattle from attacks by wild animals.
Heh
Mythology
Heh was the personification of infinity - usually in the temporal sense of eternity. In hieroglyphic writing the figure of Heh was used to denote a million. The god was thus associated with the idea of millions of years and is sometimes paired with the female deity Hauhet representing the alternative Egyptian word for eternity, djet. Mythologically, hO\¥ever, Heh - along with his consort Hauhet - was a men1ber of the ogdoad of eight primeval deities worshipped at Hermopolis Magna. The god was also associated with the myth of the 'celestial cow' who was supported by Shu and eight Heh deities two at each leg - and with the solar barque which Heh lifted back into the sky at the end of its nocturnal journey through the netherworld.

Sometimes a paln1 branch is also placed on the god's head. In detailed representations the palm branches are given additional elements such as the tadpole glyph for '100,000' or the shen ring of 'eternity'. The god often kneels on a basket signifying 'all' or universality, and may have ankh signs suspended from his hands or arms. Heh deities may also be depicted in the n1ythological settings described above - supporting the celestial cow or the solar barque of Re.
Worship
These iconographic characteristics reinforced the use of the figure of Heh to express the wish of millions of years of life or rule, so that the god is frequently depicted in amulets from as early as late Old Kingdom times, and in royal iconography especially on household or personal items associated with the king. Anumber of objects from the tomb of Tutankhamun, for example, were decorated with the figure of Heh, and these would indicate that the god's presence was an important addition to the New Kingdo1n royalfunerary assemblage.
Heka
Mythology
For the Egyptians, heka or 'n1agic' was a divine force which existed in the universe like 'power' or 'strength' and which could be personified in the form of the god Heka. Mythologically, heka was believed to have existed from the time of creation and to have empowered the creation event so that the god Heka could likewise be seen as a creator god. At Esna, although doubtless based on a late popular etymology, his name is thus explained as 'the first work'. Magic empowered all the gods, and Heka was also a god of power whose nan1e was tied to this meaning from the 20th dynasty onward by being vvritten emblematically with the hieroglyph for 'power', although originally the god's name may
have meant 'he who consecrates the ka', and he is called 'Lord of the kas' in the Coffin 'fexts (CT 261). Because of his great power the Pyramid Texts make it clear that Heka was feared by the gods themselves (PT 472), and he was said to accompany the sun god in his barque as vvell as to protect the god Osiris in the underworld.
Iconography
Invariably portrayed in anthropon1orphic form, Heka was usually represented as a man, with the usual garb and curved beard of the gods. In the Late Period, however, Heka was venerated in the fonn of a child - as were several other male deities - and was thus shown accompanying
various divine couples as their 'son' in a number _ representations.
Worship
Like most deities representing areas or aspects c, the cosmos, Heka was not served by a regular cul· though his role in religion was of considerabi importance. He was naturally invoked in man. magico-religious contexts and at Esna in Romar-times, for example, a statue of the god was taken i:procession from the temple through the surround ing fields to ensure their productivity. Heka al played a role in afterlife beliefs. Because he \1\-·a, viewed as a god of inestimable power, the Pyrami Texts directly claim his authority (PT 539) and th Coffin Texts contain a spell 'to become the go. Heka' (CT 261).

Hu
Hu personified the concept of 'authoritativ utterance' and was thus closely connected to idea, of power and control. He was said to have come int being from a drop of blood from the phallus of th sun god and therefore was tied to the povver of th pre-e1ninent deity Re. However, he is also closet linked - at least conceptually - \vith the Memphit idea of creation, in which the god Ptah created th universe through his own authoritative utterano

is an early one. In the Pyramid Texts the god appears as the companion of the deceased king in the heavens (PT 251), and these texts repeatedly assert that the king assumes authority - in one instance explicitly saying 'authority [Hu] has bowed his head to me' (PT 697) - showing that the king maintains his n1onarchical authority and has povver over the forces of the afterlife. Hu was rarely represented pictorially, but is sometimes depicted as an anthropomorphic deity and appears as such in scenes shov.,ring the boat of Re and his attendant deities in the underworld.
/ah
Iah vvas a lunar god whose narne means 'lVIoon' and who is known from relatively early times. Originally an independent deity, he was later largely absorbed by I{honsu and is thus sometimes viewed as an adult form of that god and sometimes independently. Iah appears in the Pyramid Texts where the deceased king announces that the rnoon (Iah) is his brother (PT 1001) and father (PT 1104), but by New Kingdom times Khonsu and Thoth play more dominant roles as lunar deities. Nevertheless, Iah is found as an amulet and in other representations in later dynasties in which he is depicted as a standing n1an, often wrapped in the same manner as Khonsu, and wearing the san1e full and crescent moon symbols, though often these are surmounted by an Atef Crown with yet another disk above it. In addition to the divine beard, the god usually wears a long tripartite wig rather than the sidelock of Khonsu, and he may also carry a tall staff. To a somewhat lesser degree Iah was also fused with Thoth and he may be depicted as ibis-headed like that god. One of 1utankhamun's pectorals has a winged scarab holding up the boat of the lunar eye above which is a crescent moon and disc - imagery which could refer to Iah.
lmhotep
Mythology
A high official of the 3rd dynasty, Imhotep is best known as the vizier and 'overseer of works' of King Djoser, for whom he constructed the great Step Pyramid complex at Saqqara - the first Egyptian pyramid and the world's first known monumental stone structure. Although apparently a commoner by birth, he served as a priest of Ptah and his connection with the god led eventually to the myth that he was the son of Ptah by a human mother named Khreduankh. During his lifetime Imhotep rose through the ranks of temple and government offices to become a high priest and courtier of great importance. In addition to his work as architect, he seems to have been a man of considerable learning associated with many other intellectual achievements and he became a patron of medicine, of writing and of knowledge in general. Although his n1edical achievements are not contemporaneously documented, the fact that Imhotep became known as a

virtual medical demigod within a century or so of his death seems to indicate that he may well have been a highly skilled physician. As a result of his reputation for learning, Imhotep was also linked to the cult of the god 'fhoth. The tomb of Imhotep has never been found, though it is possible that the large uninscribed mastaba numbered 3,518 at Saqqara is in fact that structure.
Iconography

Usually depicted in scribal fashion, seated and wear long kilt and skull-cap or shaven head with a .... rus roll unscrolled across his lap to symboli. scholarly nature and scribal patronage.
Worship
The veneration of I1nhotep grew to deifican the Late Period and the Graeco-Roman era ,rh cult reached its zenith, and a number of shrine""temples were dedicated to the deified schola main areas of worship appear to have been area of Saqqara, on the island of Philae, a: Thebes where he was also worshipped alonb the deified 18th-dynasty sage Amenophis Hapu at Deir el-Bahri and in the Ptolemaic temDeir el-Medina. An important inscription rega. him was placed in the temple of Ptah at Karr



the reign of Tiberius. His cult centres were places of pilgrimage for sufferers who prayed and slept there in the hope that the god would heal them or reveal remedies to them through inspired dreams. As the patron of medicine he was identified by the Greeks with their god of medicine, Asklepius, and his cult centre at Saqqara is called the 'Asklepion'. Mummified ibises were left by worshippers as votive offerings for Imhotep in the underground catacombs in this area, and pilgrims also left models of injured limbs or diseased organs there in the hope of being healed by the god. While Imhotep's position as a deified commoner was not unique in ancient Egypt, he vvas unrivalled in the high degree and widespread level of veneration he received.
Khonsu
Mythology
The god Khonsu was a moon god whose earliest attested character is considerably different from his later manifestation in New Kingdom 'fhebes where he appears as the benign son of Amun and Mut. In the Pyramid Texts he appears in the famous 'Cannibal Hymn' as a bloodthirsty deity who assists the deceased king in catching and slaying those gods that the king 'feeds upon' in order to absorb their strength (PT 402). Later the god appears to have been associated with childbirth, but it is in his role as an integral n1ember of the all-powerful Theban triad (Amun, Mut, Khonsu) that .Khonsu is best known. There Khonsu was primarily viewed as a lunar god, but he exhibited several different aspects, appearing among other forms as Khonsu pa-khered ('Khonsu the Child'); Khonsu pa-ir-sekher 'Khonsu the provider' (the Chespisichis of the Greeks); Khonsu heseb-ahau 'Khonsu, decider of the life span'; and Khonsu em-waset nefer-hetep 'Khonsu in Thebes' - apparently the most important Theban manifestation of the god. The various forms of the god interacted with one another as can be seen from the inscription known as the Bentresh Stela inscribed in Thebes in the 4th century BC but purporting to record a pronouncement of Ramesses II some 800 years earlier. The stela tells hov, the Egyptian king loaned a statue of l(honsu pa-irsekher to the king of Bakhtan to aid in the healing of his daughter, Bentresh, and includes discourse between this form of Khonsu and the more senior Khonsu in Thebes. Although firmly associated with Amun and Mut at Thebes, at Korn Ombo Khonsu was regarded as the son of Sobek and Hathor, and at Edfu Temple Khonsu was linked to Osiris as 'the son of the leg', referring to the relic of the netherworld god said to be preserved at that site. As a moon god Khonsu was also sometimes associated vvith Shu, god of the air, and with Horus. Like Thoth, he participated in the reckoning of time and was believed to influence the gestation of both
humans and animals. In the past the name of Khonsu was thought to be derived from the elements kh 'placenta' and nesu 'king' as a personification of the royal placenta, but it is now generally believed to be based on the verb khenes 'to cross over' or 'to traverse', meaning 'he who traverses [the sky]'.
Iconography
Khonsu is usually depicted in anthropomorphic form - most often as a young man enveloped in mumn1y bandages or a tightly fitting garment, though his arms may be partially or completely unrestrained. He frequently wears his lunar symbol consisting of the full lunar disk resting in a crescent new moon upon his head; in his role as divine child of Amun and Mut he commonly wears the sidelock of youth, though he may also wear the curved beard of the gods. The god was often depicted holding the crook and flail associated with Osiris and Horus, and a ivas or djed-headed staff (see illustration below),

but his most distinctive attribute is usually the necklace he wears with its crescent-shaped pectoral element resting on his chest and its heavy counterpoise on his back. This counterpoise is usually depicted in an inverted 'keyhole' shape and can be used to differentiate the god from representations of the god Ptah whose necklace counterpoise is of a different shape. As a sky deity Khonsu can also be depicted with the head of a falcon - usua1ly differentiated from I-Iorus and Re by the lunar disk and crescent. As a lunar deity one of his symbols was the Cynocephalus baboon, though Khonsu hin1self does not appear in this form as frequently as does
the god Thoth. Small amulets representing Khonsu in hu1nan form are known from the later dynasties, as are plaques depicting the god in fully human or falcon-headed form, sometimes with his divine parents Amun and Mut, or like Horus, standing on the back of a crocodile on the healing plaques known as
cippi (seep. 132).
Worship
Khonsu had many sanctuaries throughout Egypt, but his n1ain cult centre was Thebes. Begun in the 20th dynasty by Ramesses III and completed by a number of later rulers, the temple of Khonsu was erected within the precincts of the great Amun temple at Karnak. In certain of his festivals - such as the New Year's festival at the temple of Luxor where the god participated in the celebrations with his parents, Amun and !Vlut - the cult statue of Khonsu was transported from his precinct at Karnak on a sacred barque which vvas identified by a falcon's head at its prow and stern. The god processed along his ovvn statue-lined avenue running from his temple to Luxor indicating his importance in this and other festivals. Khonsu's fame as a god of healing was also widespread and enhanced in later times by the fact that he was believed to have personally healed one of Egypt's kings, Ptolemy IV, who called himself 'beloved of Khonsu who protects the king and drives away evil spirits'.
Mandulis
Mythology
A local solar god of the Lower Nubian region. whose actual Egyptian name was Merwel, this god is usually called Mandulis - the Greek version of his name. Little is known of the god's origins or early history but his nature was undoubtedly solar. and a late text known as the 'Vision of Mandulis· equates hin1 quite naturally with Horus and with the Greek god Apollo. He was also equated vvith the Greek Helios and at Philae he was called the 'companion' of Isis.
Iconography
Mandulis was depicted in anthropomorphic form wearing a crown of ram-horns, sun disks and cobras surn1ounted by tall plumes. He could also be represented in the form of a human-headed bird. not unlike the Egyptian ba bird, but wearing the god's complex characteristic crown.
Worship
Although he was worshipped throughout Lower Nubia, the best evidence for the cult of Mandulis is found at New Kalabsha where the god is represented along with various Egyptian deities on the walls of the re-sited Roman Period temple. The remains of a



chapel dedicated to the god may also be seen adjacent to the eastern colonnade of the Great ']emple of Isis at Philae.
Min
Mythology
Ylin was one of Egypt's most ancient and enduring deities, functioning as the supre1ne god of male sexual procreativity and as a deity of the eastern desert regions throughout dynastic history. The origin of
his name, i\ilenu, is unknown and gives us no clue to
his nature, though the Greek writer Plutarch c~aimed that it meant 'that which is seen', doubtless based on a similarity with a form of the verb to see. That he was already worshipped in predynastic tirnes is seen in the early presence of his emblem and in the three apparently predynastic colossal ~tatues of the god discovered by Petrie at Coptos in 1893 and now in Oxford's Ashmolean Museum. -~ !though not mentioned by name in the Pyramid Texts, Min may be the god referred to as the deity '\vho raises his arm in the east', and a reference to the 'procession of Min' occurs in a 5th-dynasty
tomb at Giza, showing that his cult was already established. He is also found in the Coffin Texts ,vhere the deceased associates himself with the '\voman-hunting' Min in order to possess the god's sexual powers. During the Middle Kingdon1 Min became associated with the god Horus as Min-Hor and as a result he was sometimes described as the son of Isis, though the association also led to Min being worshipped as the consort of Isis and father of Horus. As god of the eastern regions and because of his associations with sexuality and fertility, it was natural that Min gained as consort the Syrian goddess Qadesh whom he shared with the Syrian storm god Reshep. Of greatest importance to the mythological history of Min is the fact that during the 18th dynasty the god became increasingly associated with Amun of Thebes and became in essence the manifestation of An1un as primeval creator god, somewhat analogous to Atum's relationship with Re at Heliopolis. The Amun-Min association had direct political overtones, hov.rever, and from Middle Kingdom times the coronations and jubilee festivals of the pharaoh seem to have incorporated rituals of Min aimed at promoting the potency of the king. This form of Min revered in the Theban area was known as Min-Amun-ka-mutefor simply Amun ka-mutef'Amun, bull of his mother'. The Greeks associated Min ,vith their god Pan.
Iconography
iVIin was usually depicted in fully anthropomorphic form as a wrapped or mummified ithyphallic man standing upright and wearing a cap or cro,vn to which long streamers are attached and surn1ounted by two tall plumes. I-Iis legs are always held tightly together - either as a result of his swathed body or in continuity of the form of the earliest sculptural representations of the god - and only his erect penis, held in his left hand, and right arm project from the wrappings enveloping his body. The god's right arm is raised with his hand extended upvvards and appears to be held behind him in twodimensional representations, though sculptural works make it clear that this is a result of artistic convention and the arm is in reality held upward at the god's right side. The gesture is not really understood, but n1ay well be protective or smiting in nature, as this appears to be its 1neaning among several other Near Eastern raised-arm deities. Usually a flail is placed on or above the god's raised arm. Representations of Min may depict him with various other items such as a collar or pectoral and braces, but none of these items is a fixed attribute. In coloured representations the god's skin is always black, perhaps symbolic of the black soil which was the basis of all fertility in Egypt. Min was depicted as a falcon in the 5th Upper Egyptian nome, but this was not a standard aspect of the god's iconography, vvhile in his cult centres of Gebtu and Khent-Min, the god was worshipped in

the form of a white bull, 1,,vhich clearly represented Min's sexual potency. The cos lettuce (Lactuca sativa) which vvas often depicted in pots or on offering tables with the god fron1 the 6th dynasty through Roman times was also a sexual reference, as the milky white sap of the lettuce seems to have been viewed as symbolic of semen and the plant may have been considered an aphrodisiac. The strange emblem of Min may also be an iconographic clue to the god's original character, but it remains enigmatic, having been interpreted as everything fro1n a fossil belemnite and a lighh1ing bolt to the sliding bolt of the god's shrine.
Worship
Although Min was venerated throughout Egypt, tvvo cities were particularly associated vrith the god. The oldest site is that called by the Greeks Coptos and the Egyptians Gebtu (the modern Qift, between Qena and Luxor) at the western end of the Wadi Hammamat which led to the mining regions of the eastern desert- and hence represented Min's role as a tutelary deity of that area. The original god of
Gebtu may have been the ithyphallic Rahes who is called 'regent of the land of the South' in the Pyran1id Texts, and it was this god that was represented with Min in falcon form on the 5th Upper Egyptian nome sign, though the creatures were later identified as Horus and Min. Archaeological evidence of the worship of Min dating to the Middle Kingdom has been found at Coptos as well as in the foundation deposits of a Nevv Kingdom temple, though the surviving ruins are of Graeco-Roman date. The other major site associated with Min was Khent-Min or 'Shrine of Min' which the Greeks called Panopolis (the modern Akhmim, near Sohag), and the emblem of the nome standard in
this area was the Min emblem itself. Khent-Min was the home of the high priest of Min Yuya, who was the father-in-law of Amenophis III and father of Tutankhan1un's successor Ay, who built a rock-cut chapel to the god in that area. Min's role as a god of fertility was of understandable importance in an agriculturally dependent area such as ancient Egypt, so we find scenes such as a relief of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu where the king is

ie god Neper was a grain deity whose agriculturigin was an early one and who 1nay well have Pdated that aspect of Osiris whom he resembled -.e,·eral ,vays. The Coffin Texts mention Neper as .. d 'hving after he has died' (CT 1195), and the god , largely assimilated with Osiris as time pro~ d. The hieroglyphic writing of Neper's name ludes thesymbol for grain; and in a procession of ties carved in the reign of the 5th-dynasty king 1-ture the body of the god is dotted to symbolize .. grain which Neper represented. Because the rYest \:vas so dependent upon the yearly flooding the Nile, the inundation deity Hapy ,vas said to ·1ord of Neper', but the god was honoured in his "TI right as an important deity of the harvest and .sperity. Neper was often associated with the bra goddess Renenutet who also was a patron of e harvest. A. cult centre of the god is knovvn to \·e been constructed in the southern Fayum by ~enemhet III and IV.
Nun
· tythology

He was thus called the 'father' of the .ds,but this was mainly a temporal distinction as bore no genealogical relationship to them. Like :1er members of the Ogdoad (see p. 77), he was :-:entially an element of the unformed cosmos and us persisted as a feature of Egyptian religion but :hout any developed 1nythology. Nun, however, as considered to continue to exist outside the unds of the created universe even after the ,vorld ased to be. In this sense Nun was the hidden abyss d is referred to in this manner throughout the Tam1d Texts and in later literature more as a loca:, than as a deity. The only relationship between 1s \.Vorld and the outlying waters of Nun is found the fact that beings such as stillborn babies and ndemned souls v.rho had no part in the afterlife ere consigned to this area beyond existence. On other hand, any terrestrial body of vvater could -:o be called Nun and we find the Nile River, sacred
temple lakes, artificial pools and ponds, and even underlying ground water all called by the god's name or said to be his. 1'he consort of Nun was Naunet vvho was really only a linguistic and logical complement to the god without any true individual identity.

these Ne,v Kingdom royal tombs appear to syinbolica.Dy descend toward the underlying waters of Nun in order to tie them to the underlying basis of creation and thus recreation and rebirth. Nun was also represented in another symbolic manner in the undulating n1udbrick enclosure vvalls constructed around many temples. The convex and concave courses of these walls are believed to have represented the waters of Nun, symbolically depicting the outlying parameters of the universe which vvas modelled in the architectural programme of Egyptian temple design.
Worship
As an aspect of the precreated world Nun had no personal cult and had no temples, priests or certain rituals) though the ritual purification of the priests in the sacred lakes constructed within the precincts of temples came closest to this, as the pious ablutions not only physica11y cleansed the sacred officiants but also allowed them to rise, renewed by the waters of Nun.
Onuris
Mythology
The Egyptian god Anhur, more comn1only known by his Greek name Onuris, was a god of war and hunting originating in the Thinite region around Abydos. His name means 'he who leads back the distant one' and appears to be based on the mythical manner in which Onuris is said to have journeyed to Nubia in order to bring back the leonine 'Eye of Re' who became his consort as the lioness-goddess Mekhit. In this legend Onuris parallels the Heliopolitan god Shu who was also considered to have brought back the fearson1e 'eye' as his own consort, Tefnut, though the meaning of the name Anhur suggests the story may have been original with him. In any event, Onuris was often equated with Shu and \:Vas also linked to the sun god under the epithet 'son of Re' who hunted and slew the enemies of his solar-deity father. Onuris ,,vas also associated with Horus. In the Ptole1naic Period Onuris vvas identified by the Greeks with their own vvar god, Ares, and the Romans also maintained this martial identity of Onuris as may be seen in a representation of the Emperor Tiberius on a column shaft in the ten1ple of Korn Ombo which shows the Roman wearing the characteristic crown of the god.
Iconography
Onuris was depicted as a standing god, bearded and with a short wig sunnounted by a uraeus and either two or four tall plumes. As 'lord of the lance' the god stands vvith his right hand raised as if to thrust a lance or spear, while in his left hand he often holds a length of rope perhaps symbolic of his role in capturing his lioness consort. In so1ne cases the rope is
not shovvn and the god may be represented grd. ing his raised spear in both hands, while in o· cases neither spear nor rope are shown and the 1:is simply depicted with his arms raised as if were holding these attributes.

Mythology
Osiris was unquestionably one of the most imp tant deities of ancient Egypt, figuring prominent in both monarchical ideology and popular religi as a god of death, resurrection and fertility. Both ~ meaning of the god's name and his exact origins a enigmatic. The etymology of the name Osi:(Egyptian Usir) is made confusing by its abbrevia ed hieroglyphic spelling, but a recent stu concluded that it is most plausibly 'mighty or (Egyptian useru). I-Iis birthplace was said to · Rosetau in the necropolis of the western desert ne Memphis, but this is doubtless a mythical pla'-' ment related to the god's funerary role.
The developing character of Osiris: It seems like that Osiris was originally a fertility god \\; chthonic connections based in his identificati with the earth, and that he was also associated some point with the Nile's inundation, perha~
through its resultant alluvium and fertility. Yet L'· direct association of Osiris with agriculture seerr to have occurred later. As time progressed and rt cult of Osiris spread throughout Egypt, the g assimilated many other deities and rapidly took f



their attributes and characteristics. It seems prob
able, for example, that the god took over the story of an earthly ruler who was resurrected after his death m the ancient god Andjety of Busiris whose ,ignia were also the same as those used by Osiris. . !any of the epithets accorded Osiris may also be ~n to have been taken over from other deities. f ... m the ancient jackal god Khenty-imentiu of bydos Osiris took the title 'foremost of the t:Sterners', and from Anubis he took the title 'he ho is the god's tent', relating to the ten1porary 'Jth of embalming, etc. Many of the titles and epiiets applied to him also reflect the god's nature as a n.'1erary deity, which if not original to Osiris cer:nly became central in his identity. Chief among c.3e, the title ivenenefer, from which the Greek ime Onnophris was taken, probably means some1ng like 'he vvho is in everlastingly good ndition',showing the god's victory over the decay · death. His seemingly anomalous title 'Lord of 1e living' is also a purposeful denial of death and fers to those 'living' in the netherworld. An important development of Osiris, however, which went lkyond his basic identity as a resurrected god and uler of the underworld, was the role he played as udgeof the dead.
?'he 1nythic cycle of Osiris: In the Pyramid Texts : iris is of primary importance as one of the three
nost frequently mentioned deities along with
'-! )rus and Re. It seems clear that once Osiris began rise to widespread in1portance the priests of -ieliopolis incorporated him along with certain ~her deities into their own theological framework. The Osiride legends thus incorporate Osiris'

'siblings' Isis, Nephthys, and Seth as well as his son Horus, and represent the most extensive mythic cycle in ancient Egyptian culture. In their developed form the core myths were preserved by the Greek writer Plutarch in his work De !side et Osiride, where essentially it is claimed that the god once ruled Egypt as a king until he was murdered and cruelly dismembered and scattered by his jealous brother Seth. Due to the loyalty and dedication of his wife Is is and with the help of their sister Nephthys, Osiris was found and revivified and became the god of the netherworld.Horus, the posthumously conceived son of Osiris and Isis, avenged his father's death by defeating Seth and in time became the king of all Egypt as the rightful heir of Osiris. This story had great appeal both as a theological rationale for the Egyptian monarchial system in which the deceased king was equated with Osiris and was followed to the throne by his 'Horus' successor, and also as a story which proffered the hope of immortality through resurrection - which had a universal .appeal and was claimed at first by kings and eventually by nobles and commoners also. On the other hand, it is equally true that as a chthonic god Osiris retained a measure of fearsomeness and could be regarded with awe. The Pyramid Texts preserve this darker aspect of the god in spells vvhich imply the king's protection from Osiris by Re, as do the Coffin Texts, which speak of Osiris as a
threatening power in some cases, and the Book of
the Dead - which along with the god's positive titles also lists epithets such as 'the terrible'. Overall, however, the human origin, vulnerability, and resurrection of the god and the emphasis on family devotion and loyalty vvhich runs through the

Osiride myths meant that Osiris was viewed as a benign deity, who represented the clearest idea of physical salvation available to the ancient Egyptian.
The relationship of Osiris ivith other gods: Outside of the Osiride myths themselves Osiris was associated with several other deities. For example, the ba or soul of the god \vas thought to reside in the sacred ram Ba-neb-djedet vvhich \Vas worshipped in the Delta town of Mendes; and the Apis bull of Memphis, normally associated with Ptah, was seen as a manifestation of Osiris. A complex and particularly important relationship existed between Osiris and the sun god Re. Although Osiris was incorporated into the 1-Jeliopolitan theological system at a relatively early date, tlhe god continued to grow in importance and by Nevv Kingdom times his stature as an independent god \;vas considerable, as is seen in titles which were applied to him such as 'lord of the universe', 'ruler of eternity' and 'king of the gods'. Osiris' position became, in fact, comparable to that of the sun god himself. He came to be regarded not only as the counterpart of Re in the netherworld, but also in some cases as the sun god's own body - so that Osiris and Re came to be considered a.s representing the body and soul, respectively, of a single great god. The solar cycle was thus imagined as the ba of Re descending into the underworld to unite with Osiris as his own corpse. Nevertheless, Osiris and Re maintained independent characteristics, identities, and realms. The fusion of the two gods was mainly a product of Nevi Kingdom theological expression in specific contexts and Egyptian theology never totally overcame the dichotomy implicit in the idea of Re as
lord of the heavens and Osiris as lord of the un world. Osiris vvas also mythologically conne with the moon, however, though this was a rela ly minor association. The ultimate fusion of 0-; with other deities occurred in the reign of Ptole,y who introduced the hybrid Serapis as a fusic· Osiris, Apis and various Greek gods - an artit creation which nevertheless become one of the rimportant deities of Egypt at the end of the d) tic age. The Greeks themselves associated ~ with their own god Dionysus.
Iconography
Osiris is usually represented in anthropomor form, as a human mun1my whose skin may be,, - perhaps to symbolize the mumn1y wrappings more usually black as the colour of chthonic de and of the dark Nile alluvium, or green as repre--. tative of vegetation and fertility. The go invariably depicted standing or sitting stiffly t vvith both legs together and vvith his hands pre_ ing fron1 his wrappings to grasp the crook 2nd which are his chief attributes. These item~ regalia have been thought to represent pa~t implements, but the origin of the flail is not t and it may have had other meanings.In any .~ve:seems more likely that both iten1s were taken together from royal regalia as they are presen representations of kings from the time of Nar:on.Sometimes the god holds a was sceptre1 but is clearly a later usage taken over from the icono,.. phy of other gods. Regional variation has ~~ shown to affect the manner in \vhich the regalia held. In Middle Egyptian Osiride figures the ar are usually held at the same level, whereas in l-p· Egypt they are frequently crossed at the wrists.-:

earliest known representation of Osiris, which dates to the 5th dynasty (a partial representation on a block fron1 the reign of King Djedkare-lsesi), depicts the god \¥earing a divine wig; but from the :Vliddle Kingdom he is frequently shown ,vearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt - possibly indicating his Upper Egyptian origin - and this crown is found in Osiride iconography throughout all later periods. Another crown closely associated with the god is the so-called Atef Crown - similar to the \Vhite Crown but with two side feathers and occasionally vvith horizontal horns and solar disks a:tached. This crown, either placed directly on the h2ad or atop a royal wig, appears to have originated \vith the god Andjety, however, and to have a secondary association with Osiris. Osiris is someti1nes shown wearing other crowns and, especially in later periods, these can be of complex, fused forms, but the White and Atef forms remain standard. From :--Jew Kingdom times the god is often shown wearing a broad collar and sometimes bracelets worn at the wrist. Later iconographic forms also often tend to incorporate an increasing amount of detail in their
depiction of the god's mummy wrappings - as in instances showing bands crossed over the chest, a sash tied at the waist, a counterpoise attached to the broad collar, etc. The association between Osiris and the symbol known to the Egyptians as the djed column or pillar meant that the god was often depicted in the form of the djed, sometimes as a partially-personified pillar with human arms or as an anthropoid mummy with a djed-pillar head. Although the death of Osiris was never depicted in Egyptian art, the god is frequently shown lying on the funerary bier, mourned by Isis and Nephthys. Osiris' close connection with kingship and his role as king of the dead mean that he is probably more often depicted enthroned than any other deity. In funerary scenes the deceased is thus frequently shovvn before the enthroned god who is supported, at his rear, by Isis and Nephthys (less frequently by Hathor as mistress of the west). vVhen depicted in this seated manner, the god is son1etimes shown with the diminutive figures of the four sons of Horus before him or, in other cases, the so-called imiut fetish.

Due to the gradual unification of solar and Osirian ideas during the New Kingdom, Osiris is also sometimes depicted in the syncretized form of Osiris-Re or Re-Osiris. Usually this fusion takes the form of a mummiform body (Osiris) with the head of a falcon, ram, or beetle (Re) as seen in the tomb of Nefertari in the Valley of the Queens, vvhich depicts a ram-headed mummy identified both as 'Re resting in Osiris' and 'Osiris resting in Re'. The relationship between Osiris and Re is also seen in many representational works which juxtapose the symbols of the respective gods in the same composition - such as mummy and falcon, djed and sun disk, etc. Because Osiris was also mythologically associated vvith the moon, the god may sometimes be represented by the lunar disk - especially in depictions where this is shown with Anubis.
Worship
The cult of Osiris lasted well over 2,000 years. It was already well established by the end of the 5th dynasty vvhen the god's name appears in both the Pyramid rfexts and inscriptions in private mastabas, and flourished till the end of the dynastic age. It was also universal in that the god had many cult centres and ,.vas venerated throughout Egypt. Due to the mythicalscattering of the dismembered body of Osiris, a number of sites claimed pieces of the god and were thus at least locally important centres of his worship. Such, for example, were Athribis ,vhich claimed the god's heart; and Biga, Edfu, Herakleopolis and Sebennytos which all claimed one or more of his legs. The most prominent sites linked with Osiris were Abydos and Busiris, the two locales most closely associated with the god and his chief cult centres in Upper and Lower Egypt respectively. Abydos, the ancient town of Abdju, represents the oldest known sanctuary of Osiris and the re1nains of an Old Kingdom temple of the god are still extant there. 'fhe area also boasted the Osireion, a symbolic 'tomb of Osiris' adjoining the temple of Sethos I, and the 1st-dynasty tomb of Djer which was traditionally venerated as the tomb of Osiris from at least New Kingdom times. The symbol of the Abydene area was a beehive-like container surmounted by two tall plumes which was interpreted to represent a reliquary containing the god's head. Busiris in the middle Delta was the Lower Egyptian counterpart of Abydos. Its ancient nan1e was Djedu, the hieroglyphic writing of which contained two djed columns, and the later Greek

He was also invoked in many spells and protective texts, some of \Vhich were written in the form of royal decrees made by Osiris as king of Egypt. Although the cult of Osiris grew by its own power and appeal throughout most of Egyptian history, it became especially widespread beyond the borders of Egypt in Graeco-Roman times due to its close link to the cult of Isis- who offered her follovvers a form of physical salvation based almost entirely on her role in the mythical drama of Osiris.

Divine child of Haroeris (see Horus) and his consort Hanhor-ta-senet-nefret at Korn Ombo, Panebtaw·y, \\'hose name means 'the lord of the T'Aro Lands', personified the pharaoh as the divine son of Horus the Elder and thus the rightful heir to the kingdom of Egypt. He was depicted as a young man \vith the sidelock of youth and with his finger placed at his mouth.
Pataikos
fVlythology
Pataikos represents a type of minor amuletic deity named from a passage in Herodotus which mentions dwarf-like protective images with which the Phoenicians adorned the prows of their triremes. Herodotus thought that these dwarfish figures represented pygmies and wrote that they vvere similar to the statue of Hephaistos (Ptah) in Memphis. The Egyptian images so named may well have originated \Vith the craftsman god Ptah as the epithet 'Ptah the dwarf' is known and dwarfs seem to be ahvays present in Old Kingdom scenes of metal workshops.
J,conography
The Egyptian pataikoi are similar to the god Bes in appearance but have some distinctive differences. Like Bes they usually represent a small, short (and usually bow-legged) male with hands resting on his hips. They may also brandish knives and hold or bite snakes, but their overly large heads are without facial hair, and they do not have the enlarged eyes and prominent tongue associated vvith Bes. The figures have bald or closely-cropped human heads or sometimes the head of a falcon or a ram upon which they may wear a sidelock, a scarab beetle or an Atef Crown. In some cases pataikoi are tvvo-headed or they may be represented back to back with other deities, notably Bes and Harpokrates (see Horus). The pataikoi themselves also often show affinities with Harpokrates, as when they are shown standing on crocodiles in the manner of that god.
Worship
Crudely produced an1ulets of Pataikos seem to appear in the late Old Kingdom, but it is not until New Kingdom times that clearly detailed examples are found and they then continue throughout the later dynastic periods.
Peteese and Pihor
Peteese and Pihor were deified brothers who were worshipped as minor gods in the region of Dendur a little to the south of Aswan in Lower Nubia. The two brothers seem to have lived during or around the 26th dynasty and apparently were elevated to divine status as a result of drowning in the Nile and subsequently becoming associated with Osiris. The Emperor Augustus built a small temple to honour the brothers on the west bank of the Nile at Dendur vvhich was moved to avoid :flooding by the rising waters of Lake Nasser and which is now in the 1\/Ietropolitan 1\/luseum of Art in New York. Reliefs in the temple show Peteese and Pihor presenting offerings to the superior deity Isis.

Mythology
Ptah appears to be one of the oldest of Egypt's gods and is attested representationally from the 1st dynasty onward. Nevertheless, the great god of Memphis was perhaps originally only a locally important deity whose influence developed and

spread slovvly over time. Even in the Pyramid Texts Ptah is mentioned only indirectly a very fe"v times, though it is difficult to ascertain if this is due to an early relative lack of importance, a lack of function in the mortuary sphere, or the desire on the part of the Heliopolitan theologians to minimize the pos1tion of the Memphite deity. Mythologically, the consort of Ptah was the lioness-goddess Sekhmet, and her son Nefertem completed the major divine triad of the Memphite region. Eventually the god fulfilled several important roles.
Ptah, lord of Me1nphis: There is no doubt that the primary geographic association of Ptah was with the general region of Memphis. The founding of 'Ineb-hedj' or 'White Walls' - the city later called Memphis - as the administrative capital of Egypt at the time of the unification of the country around
3000 BC doubtless had a profound effect on the development of Ptah's importance, and the god soon became the chief deity of t he area. By the Middle Kingdom Ptah was thus called 'Lord of Ankh-tawy', referring to the city of Memphis; and many scholars believe that the name Egypt itself is based on the Greek form of the Egyptian 'Hut-kaPtah', 'the temple of the ka of Ptah'. The Memphite locality was also the origin of several of Ptah's frequent titles such as Ptah res-ineb-ef, 'Ptah who is south of his wa11', in reference to the position of the god's sanctuary beyond his temple's great temenos wall to the south of Memphis, and Ptah khery-bakef, 'Ptah who is under his moringa tree', referring to an ancient tree-god of Memphis who was absorbed by Ptah at an early date.
Ptah the craftsman: If Ptah was not originally a god of craftsmanship, this aspect of his identity was certainly an ancient one as it can be seen at an early date and then remains constant throughout the god's history. The artistic and cultural development of the Old Kingdom and the great increase in the number of craftsmen needed to serve the capital of Memphis and to produce the funerary goods needed for its necropoleis could well have been influential in the rise of the god. During the Old Kingdom the high priest of Ptah bore the title werkherep-hemu 'great leader of the craftsmen'; and \¥bile the god's name gives no firm clue to his origin, it is perhaps based on a root of later words meaning 'to sculpt' and thus related to his identity as a craftsman god. In this role Ptah was both the sculptor or smith of mankind and creator of the arts and crafts, and the lVIemphite deity of crafts1nen became particularly associated with the dwarves who seem to have traditionally vvorked as jewellers and artisans in Old Kingdom workshops. Ptah was also clearly associated with other groups of craftsmen such as the workers of Deir el-Medina who constructed the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Naturally enough the Greeks and Romans associated Ptah

directly \Vith their own smith gods Hephaistos Vulcan.
Ptah the creator: As a result of his identifica
with craftsmanship, or concurrent vvith it. F became a god of creation and was known as
'sculptor of the earth' who, like the ram god Khr was believed to form everything on his pon wheel. More fundamentally, Ptah came to be kn as the 'ancient one' who united in his person b. the masculine primeval deity Nun and his femir counterpart, Naunet, so that he was seen as the mordial deity whose creative power was manif~ every aspect of the cosmos. He was sometimes v shipped as Ptah-Nun or even Ptah-Naunet in • role, though the creative process was also attribu to the god alongside the old Memphite earth c Tatenen under the name Ptah-Tatenen. rfhe sto~ creation as attributed to Ptah by the priest~ Men1phis - whereby the god was said to have ere:: ed the ,vorld through his thought and creative n· or command (see p. 18) - was one of the most in lectual creation myths to arise in Egypt and in whole of the ancient world.



Ptah the chthonic and afterlife god: As a result of his proximity to the Memphite earth god Tatenen and the mortuary deity Sokar, Ptah took on some of the aspects of those deities. He was thus sometimes ,·enerated in a creative, chthonic aspect as PtahTatenen. Although Ptah himself was not frequently associated with the afterlife, as the composite deity Ptah-Sokar and later as Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, he gained considerable importance in this area also. The n1ummiform nature of Ptah in his painted and carved representations also must have served as a constant reminder of the funerary and afterlife associations of the god.
PtaJ1, hearer of prayers: As with most deities, the epithets accorded Ptah were wide-ranging and compli1nentary. Honourific titles such as nefer-her ·merciful of face' or neb-maat 'lord of truth' are Jften given to the god in inscriptions, but epithets extolling the god as a hearer of prayers seem to have had particular significance. Many votive stelae have been found in the area of Ptah's temple at \ 1emphis and elsewhere in Egypt carved with representations of hun1an ears and dedicated to the god as mesedjer-sedjem, 'the ear which hears', who ,yould hear the petitions of his devotees. As both :he god of craftsmen and hearer of prayers we find evidence of Ptah being beseeched by the workmen of Deir el-Medina such as one Neferabu who admits on a votive stela that he made a false oath in Ptah's name and subsequently lost his sight in some manner so that he begs 'the ear which hears' for forgiveness. On the perimeters of temples we also find shrines or chapels of the hearing ear vvhich like\vise served the purpose of transmitting the individual's prayers to the deity within the ten1ple. The god Ptah often figures in these shrines, as in the one constructed at the entrance to the great mortuary temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu.
l1conography
lhe iconography of Ptah \vas particularly stable and persisted in essentially the same form throughout most of the dynastic age - beginning with the earliest known depiction of the god on a 1stdynasty bowl from Tarkhan. Ptah was almost invariably represented anthropomorphically as a s tanding, mummiform figure with feet together and ,vith his hands protruding from his tightly wrapped shroud to hold his characteristic sceptre (comprising a was sceptre surmounted by ankh and djed syn1bols). The god usually ,vears a close-fitting skull cap without any additional elements of headdress, though in his association with Osiris Ptah sometimes is depicted with a small disk atop his head flanked by the two tall plumes worn by that god. From the Middle Kingdom onwards he wears a distinctive straight beard rather than the usual curved divine beard found on representations of
(Above) Ptah within his shrine. The straight beard and

are distinctive attributes rarely seen with other deities. Tomb of Amenherkhepeshef, Valley of the Queens, western Thebes.

other Egyptian gods. Ptah is also usually depicted wearing either what appears to be a large tassel at the rear of his garment or a broad collar which is balanced by a counterpoise hanging behind his back. This counterpoise is rounded at the top and sometimes flared at the bottom like a narrovv, tubelike bell and is distinctive enough to allow even partial images of Ptah to be differentiated frorn similar representations of the god Khonsu who wears a key-hole shaped counterpoise. Usually Ptah is represented standing on a narrow plinth like one of the hieroglyphs used to write the vvord maat or 'truth' and which also resembles the measuring rod used by Egyptian workmen, or upon a stepped dias suggestive of the primeval mound. Frequently he is depicted ,¥ithin an open shrine. The god was perhaps also depicted as a dwarf, as Herodotus claimed to see statues in this form in the te1np1e of Hephaistos (Ptah) at Memphis (see Pataikos), and though these statues could also have been votive representations of dwarf vvorkmen rather than the god hin1self, the god also appears in the form of a dwarf on some of the magical cippi (healing plaques) of the LatePeriod.
Worship
Although little remains of Ptah's chief temple at Men1phis, surviving historical and archaeological evidence indicates that it was a great complex befitting a god who ruled supreme in his own area fo r well over 2,000 years. The present remains date mainly to New Kingdom times, though it is evident that there were structures honouring Ptah at this site at far earlier dates. It was also at Memphis that the sacred Apis bull, which served as a manifestation and intermediary for Ptah, resided with an important cult of its own. Although he was perhaps originally associated only with the Memphite area, the veneration of Ptah soon spread throughout Egypt and the god is represented in almost all major Egyptian sites. He had his own sanctuary in the precinct of the great temple of Amun at Karnak since at least Middle Kingdom times and this temple continued to be expanded and embellished throughout the rest of the dynastic age, sho,~ing a clear continuity in the god's in1portance and vvorship in Upper Egypt. Ptah was also venerated in Egyptian Nubia where his presence is found in a nun1ber of temples including those of Ramesses II at Abu Sin1bel, elDerr, and Gerf Hussein. The god's particular importance in New Kingdom times is also seen in his inclusion in the grouping of the major deities Re, Amun and Ptah (as seen in the statuary group in the shrine of the Great Temple of Abu Simbel) and in the names of a number of kings such as Merenptah (beloved of Ptah) and Siptah (man of Ptah), as well as high-ranking officials. As the patron deity of craftsmen, Ptah was particularly venerated at sites such as Deir el-Medina where workmen and artisans lived; and as the god

stelae - either alone or with other deities, particularly Min and the Syrian goddess Qadesh. The image or nan1e of the god also occurs on n1any scarabs. The martial nature of Reshep made him an ideal royal deity, and his adoption in this way is seen in the famous stele set up by Amenophis II near the Great Sphinx at Giza and in other monuments of that king. His martial nature could also be turned to healing, and Reshep was sometimes na1ned in spells to overpower inimical influences such as the demon Akha who \Vas believed to cause abdominal pain.
Sah
The god Sah personified the constellation of Orion - the most distinctive of all the constellations in the night sky. While not part of the 'imperishable' circumpolar stars, the constellation became important in Egyptian mythology especially as it rose directly before the adjacent star Sirius (the Egyptian Sothis) - the brightest fixed star which was utilized in the calculation of the Egyptian calendar. The constellation god was thus connected with the star Sothis from an early date and the two came to be viewed as manifestations of Osiris and Isis respectively. Sah is mentioned quite frequently in the Pyramid Texts where he is called 'father of the gods' (PT 408), and the deceased king is said to enter the sky 'In the name of the Dweller in Orion, vvith a season in the sky and a season on earth' (PT 186). The association of Sah with Sothis is also clear in these early texts ,.vhere the king is told, 'You shall reach the sky as Orion, your soul shall be as effective as Sothis' (PT 723). In the funerary texts of the New Kingdom Orion is said to row towards the stars in a boat and Sah is sometimes depicted in this manner in representations found in temples and tombs - as a god surrounded by stars who sails across the sky in a papyrus skiff.
Serapis
Mythology
The hybrid god Serapis was a composite of several Egyptian and Hellenistic deities introduced at the beginning of the Ptolemaic Period in the reign of
Ptolemy I. The god thus answered the needs of a new age in vvhich Greek and Egyptian religion were brought face to face and the new deity was created to form a bridge between the two cultures. Linguistically, the god's name is a fusion of Osiris and Apis, and a cult of Osirapis had in fact existed in Egypt before the rule of the Ptolemies, but to this Egyptian core were added a number of Hellenistic deities which predominated in the god's final form. Zeus, Helios, Dionysus, Hades and Asklepius all added aspects of their respective cults, so that Serapis emerged as a thoroughly Egypto-Hellenistic deity

who personified the aspects of divine majesty, the sun, fertility, the undervvorld and afterlife, as well as healing. The mythology of Serapis was, therefore, the mythology of his underlying deities, but the aspects of afterlife and fertility were always primary to his nature. The consort of Serapis vvas said to be Isis, the greatest Egyptian goddess in Hellenistic times.
Iconography
The Hellenistic elements of Serapis dominate the god's iconography and attributes. He was portrayed in anthropomorphic form as a man wearing a Greek-style robe with Greek hairstyle and full beard and usually bearing a tall corn modius or measure on his head. In some depictions Serapis is also given curving ram's horns. Sometimes, as a result of the chthonic and fertility aspects of the god and his consort Isis, the tvvo deities were depicted as serpents - one, with a beard, representing Serapis.
Worship
The cult centre of Serapis was the great Serapeum Temple at Alexandria which was regarded as a wonder and a site of pilgrimage throughout the Mediterranean world until it was destroyed by
order of the Emperor 'rheodosius in AD 389. <rd:!1!!11 smaller temple.s and shrines were dedicated god in locations throughout Egypt, and the ,.,..,._~scult was spread through much of the G:aecx;.

areas of the Roman Empire. In Egypt itself, h er, the Egyptians never fully accepted the h. god and the evidence for his popular worship 1-siderably less than for other, traditional £~- " deities.
Shay
Mythology
Shay was the personification of the idea of de-in Egyptian religion and as such was the god c. span, or n1ore broadly of fate and fortune. IP · Instructions of Amenemopet, for example, it is that 'none can ignore Shay', though this is mea• the abstract sense of the inevitability of fai:e ra than the imminence of a predatory deity. ~ could thus be invoked as much as an idea as a sonified god, as may be seen in inscriptions frorr
reign of Akhenaten vvhere the solar Aten LS~ times said to be 'Shay vvho gives life\ _.\, personified god Shay is so1netimes mentioned a with certain goddesses such as Meskhenet Renenutet who shared an affinity with his role. in the Ptolemaic Period he was identified , Agathodaimon, the Hellenistic serpent deity ,·er ated for his fortune-telling ability.
Iconography
Shay was rarely represented in Egyptian art, bu sometimes appears in the form of an anthroporphic god in vignettes depicting the weighing of heart scene in New Kingdom funerary papyr. these scenes he is sho,vn as an undifferentia divine figure vvith the curved beard of a god identified primarily by na1ne.
Worship
Textual references to Shay and the few repr,eser tions of the god which have survived indicate t~ he was recognized more as an abstract personifi tion or conceptualization of destiny than a pe1-c- i deity to be venerated or served.
Shezmu
Mythology
The god Shezmu was a deity of wine and oil pre&: with a strongly bipolar personality who cou



»qually bless or destroy. He is attested from Old ·ingdom times on and in the famous 'Cannibal 1y1nn' of the Pyramid Texts (PT 403), Shezmu is ~e fearsome being who butchers and cooks the ,:ods then1selves that the king might absorb their --~ength. In the Coffin Texts of the Middle I(ingdom lie god lassoes the dan1ned and corrals them for --~au1ghter, squeezing their heads like grapes in a loody in1age of destruction (CT VI, 6). In the later exts of the Book of the Dead Shezmu also appears 11 connection with the nets which captured beings 11 the afterlife (BOD 153). Yet despite the apparent --ruelty of his nature Shezmu could also be benefi-ent, and as god of the presses he provided wine, oil ~nd perfumes. By the 1ew Kingdom there is more ,tress on these positive aspects, and Shez1nu '-iecame known as the provider of perfumes for the .:;ods. The Book of the Dead also contains the statet1ent, 'Shezmu is with you, he gives you the best of ·he fowl' (BOD 170). This role of beneficent provi,ion finally became primary in the Graeco-Roman Period.
con ography
-hezn1u is not frequently depicted in Egyptian art t>ut ,.vas usually shown in anthropomorphic form as he master of a press. One mythological papyrus of he 21st dynasty depicts havvk deities vvorking the ?resses of retribution which must surely represent '"" hezmu, and the god may also be depicted in eonine form or with the head of a lion - an iconog--aphy in keeping v,rith the n1ore ferocious aspect of 'lis personality. Some late representations also show ...hezmu in ram-headed form.
Worship
There is some evidence that Shezmu already had a priesthood during the Old Kingdom, and by the \ liddle Kingdom his cult ,vas certainly well estabished in the Fayum and probably elsewhere. As the benign aspect of the god's nature was increasingly , tressed, he probably became more widely accepted d.San ancillary in the cults of the other gods until, in ? tole1naic times, in temples such as Edfu and :)endera, special roorns for the production and storage of oils and unguents and other products used in emple service were presided over by Shezmu 'mas:erof the perfumery'.
Shu
Mythology
"hu, whose nan1e may mean 'emptiness' or 'he who rises up', was the god of the air and also of sunlight. In the Ennead of primary deities organized by :he priests of Heliopolis, he ,vas created by the demiurge Atwn, either fron1 his semen or mucus. "hu was husband of Tefnut, the goddess usually .;aid to represent moisture, and the pair in turn
produced Geb, god of the earth and Nut, goddess of the sky. According to Egyptian myth, Shu separated these two after Nut swallo\ved the constellations and Geb becan1e angry with her for 'eating' their children. Shu is mentioned in the Pyramid Texts where the deceased king is purified in the 'lakes of Shu' which n1ay represent mists and is said to climb up to heaven upon the 'bones of Shu' which are probably the clouds. The god was also associated with light - perhaps perceived as an aspect of the air - from Old Kingdom times, and even the arch iconoclast Akhenaten honoured the god who vvas said to dvvell in the sun's disk. For reasons which remain unclear Shu was associated with the lunar deities Thoth and Khonsu, perhaps in terms of the light of the lunar disk, or because his wife Tefnut ,vas often associated with the moon. The god was also sometimes equated with the protective deity Bes; but on the other hand, he had a darker aspect for in the netherworld he vvas said to operate an executioner's block, although he also helped protect the sun god from the serpentfiend Apophis. According to one mythic story recorded on a Ptolomaic Period granite shrine, Shu ruled as king of Egypt for many years until he became weak and tired. Then he ascended to the heavens and took up residence along with the sun god Re.
Iconography
In his iconography Shu could be represented as a lion but is usually seen in human form as a god wearing a feather - the hieroglyphic symbol for his name - upon his head. He is often depicted with his arms raised supporting the sky goddess Nut and holding her apart from her consort Geb with the assistance of the magical Heh deities. The god also appears in certain other mythologically-based scenes such as that portrayed in the famous headrest found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. In that

artifact the god kneels between two Eons symbolizing Shu and Tefnut and the horizons of yesterday and tomorrow, to support the sleeper's head on his upraised arms, doubtless symbolic of his upholding the sun. Although not found frequently in three-dimensional representations, he does appear in amu1etic form, usually kneeling with his arms raised - often supporting a sun disk.
Worship
Apart from early references in the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, the cult of the air god is not actually attested until Nevv Kingdom times when he is n1entioned in many texts of differing kinds. His chief cult centre, which he shared with his consort Tefnut, was at the ancient Nay-ta-hut (modern Tell el-Muqdam) vvhich the Greeks called Leontopolis or 'lion city' after the form in which the two deities were worshipped there. In the later Dynastic Period Shu was increasingly credited with powers that renewed the cosmos, as the god who filled the universe with the very air which was the breath of life. As a result Shu was incorporated into everyday religion in prayers and positive spells as well as certain magical texts vvhere the 'poisons' of the god were conjured to defeat demonic threats.
Sia
Sia was the personification of perception and could be said to be the equivalent of the 'heart' or mind of the god Ptah which underlay creation in the Memphite theology. According to myth, Sia, like Hu - the god personifying spoken command or utterance came into existence from drops of blood spilled from the cut phallus of the sun god Re. Hu also might be equated with the spoken creative word of Ptah, so that just as Ptah created everything through the two aspects of mind and word, the two
deities Sia and Hu form a dyad which would seem to represent the same aspects of the mind and word of Re. Usually depicted in anthropomorphic form, during the Old Kingdom Sia was visualized as a kind of divine functionary vvho stood at the right side of Re and held the god's sacred papyrus scroll. In the New Kingdom too, Sia was depicted, along with Hu and other deities, accompanying the sun god in his underworld barque, as in a number of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings.
Tatenen
Mythology
Tatenen vvas a Memphite god who first clearly appears in the Middle Kingdom, although he may be identical to an earlier deity known as KhentyTjenenet attested in Old Kingdom times. The god's name means 'risen land' and, like the Heliopolitan ben-ben (see p. 212), he symbolized the emerging of the primeval n1ound from the waters of- original creation, though in a secondary sense Tatenen could also symbolize the emergence of the fertile silt from the Nile's annual inundation, and by extension the resultant vegetation. From Ramessid times Tatenen was associated with the great Memphite god Ptah and vvas often viewed as a manifestation of that god and fused with him as Ptah-Tatenen. As an earth god Tatenen could also symbolize Egypt itself and could be associated with the earth god Geb. His primeval aspect n1eant that he could be viewed as a bisexual deity and in one text he is called the creator and 'mother' of all the gods. Tatenen also had a chthonic aspect in which he was viewed as a protector of the deceased king in the netherworld. In the New Kingdom Litany of Re he is cited as the personification of the phallus of the dead king, perhaps based on a linguistic play on the idea of rising or risen conveyed in his name.
Iconography
Usually Tatenen was represented anthropomorphically as a bearded man with a headdress consisting of a sun disk with ram's horns and two plumes. Because he was a chthonic deity and linked to the emergence of vegetation, his face and limbs may be painted a dark hue of green or some other colour.
Worship
The cult of Tatenen is known to have flourished at Memphis, and although the god may be found in temples in other areas of Egypt, his own sanctuaries ren1ained prin1arily in the Memphite area.
Wadj-Wer
A Hapy-like fecundity figure whose name means 'the great green', vVadj-Wer \Vas long believed to



have personified the Mediterranean Sea, or the sea in general, but actually may have represented the large lakes and lagoons of the north Delta region. This conclusion is based on the fact that certain texts seem to describe the crossing of the 'great green' by foot - which could refer to travelling between nearly contiguous lakes - and some texts use the determinative sign for dry land rather than that for water in writing the term. In any event, the deity is attested as early as the Old Kingdom in the mortuary temple of the Pyramid of Sahure at i-\busir, where he is depicted with water lines across his body along with other 'fecundity figures', and it is clear that he represents the rich yield of the area he represents.The god's protective underworld role also meant that he appears in the New Kingdom royal tombs, and he is clearly depicted in the monument Ramesses III made in the Valley of the Queens
for his son Amenherkhepeshef. The god seems to have been represented in amulets, but these may also represent the combined Ptah-Tatenen.
Weneg
A little known god who appears in the Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts (PT 607, 952), Weneg was a son of the sun god Re and seems to symbolize order and stability by supporting the sky and thus preventing the chaos outside the cosmos from crashing down upon the world. In this aspect he bears a different yet related role to that of Re's daughter Maat and is also similar to the Heh deities which supported the sky. Weneg was also said to be a judge of other gods, again perhaps paralleling the judicial role of the goddess Maat.

MALE CHILD DEITIES
This category of deities includes a number of gods \vho overlapped considerably in both their mythology and worship. In some cases deities \1/ere revered in both child and adult forms, though this is relatively infrequent, and the so-called 'child deities' usually represented the young offspring of major deities. As such these child gods often played a role relating to the divine conception and birth of the king and some were associated with the mammisis or 'birth houses' of later temples.
Horus the Child
The name 'Horus the Child' was given to a number of related forms of divine infant. Most of these were the son of Osiris and the goddess Isis whom she bore in the papyrus marshes of Che1nmis in the northern Delta and raised in secret there in fear of the god Seth. Occasionally, however, the infant god ,;vas included in temple groupings as the child of other divine parents - as at Medamud where he was the son of Montu and Raettawy. Already in the Pyramid Texts the god is referred to as 'the child with his finger in his mouth'; and in this form he was known as Har-hery-wadj or 'Horus upon his

papyrus plants' and sometimes as 'Horus hidden behind the papyrus' in reference to the myth of his origins. The god was most commonly called Har-pakhered (Greek Harpokrates), which translates as 'I-Iorus the Child' and was often depicted in this form seated on the lap of Isis, or standing, alone, as
depicted in the amuletic plaques known as cippi of I-Iorus. As Harsiese, 'Horus son of Isis', the god was clearly identified in his role as the goddesses' legitimate son and heir of Osiris. This is also true of the related names Horus iun-mutef or 'Horus pillar of his mother' and Har-nedj-itef (Greek Harendotes) or 'Horus saviour of his father'.
lhy
Mythology
Ihy was a child god, whose name was interpreted by the Egyptians themselves as 'sistrum player' or 'musician' and who personified the jubilation associated with the use of the sacred instrument (see p. 143). Another meaning of his name could be 'calf', referring to his relation to the cow Hathor who vvas usually held to be his mother - as at Dendera, and at Edfu where he appears as Harsomptus. Ihy was also regarded as the son of certain other deities, hovvever, and could be associated in this way with Isis, Nephthys and even Sekhmet. While Horus was



n1ost commonly viewed as lhy's father, the god ,vas also said to be the offspring of Re. Although his rnythological nature was primarily connected with music, he was also connected with the afterlife in some contexts. In the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead lhy is called 'the lord of bread' and said to be 'in charge of the beer' in reference to offerings, but also possibly in allusion to ritual celebrations which involved intoxication in the worship of Hathor.
Iconography
The god was depicted as a naked boy, wearing the sidelock of youth and with his finger to his mouth. He is not ahvays shovvn in diminutive size, however, and may be depicted at the same scale as his mother and other deities or the king appearing in the same scene. He may also vvear the uraeus on his brow and is sometimes depicted holding the sistrum and the menat necklace \vhich were his symbols and those of his mother, I-Iathor. Despite Ihy's usual depiction in anthropomorphic form, there is limited evidence of the god being depicted in the form of a calf.
\JVorship
As the son of Horus and Hathor, Ihy was one of the triad of deities worshipped at Dendera and this was his main cult site. A very early shrine in this location was rebuilt in the 4th dynasty by Khufu and
specifically dedicated to I-fathor and to lhy. The god plays particularly important roles in the mammisi or birth house of Nectanebo I at Dendera where his divine conception and birth - and that of the king were celebrated, and where 'mystery plays' in 13 acts concerning the divine birth appear to have been performed. A second birth house at this site built for Caesar Augustus celebrates the divine birth of Ihy as the son of Hathor.
Neferhetep
Not as well known as the child god lhy, Neferhetep was also portrayed as an infant deity, the son of
Hathor, in the town of Hi\v near Nag Hammadi. The young god's name means 'perfect in conciliation', probably reflecting the mythological fact that the raging goddess Hathor was transformed into a gentle and loving mother. Neferhetep was also viewed as a divine ram and symbol of male potency. He was said to be loved by 'wives at the site of his beauty' in which beauty is a circumlocution for the god's phallus. The god thus functioned in two complementary aspects - as both a child and the power behind the child's conception.
Nefertem
Mythology
Nefertem is often thought of as the god of perfumes, but this association is a secondary one and he was primarily the youthful god of the lotus blossom which rose from the primeval waters according to Egyptian myth. Nefertem ,vas thus not only identified with the blue lotus (Nymphaea cerulea) but also with the sun god who emerged from it, and his association with Re is common. In the Pyramid Texts he is called 'the lotus blossom which is before the nose of Re' (PT 266), showing that his association with perfume vvas an early and natural one. In later tin1es Nefertem ,vas also closely associated with Horus the son of Re and the two deities were sometimes merged. At Memphis, Nefertem came to be grouped with the pre-eminent god Ptah and his consort Sekhmet in a particularly important triad in which he was commonly viewed as their child. Other Egyptian cities also claimed Nefertem, however. At Buto he was the son of the cobra goddess Wadjet and he was also sometimes viewed as the son of the feline goddess Bastet.
Iconography
In his representations, Nefertem is usually depicted anthropomorphically as a male god wearing a lotus blossom upon his head. Sometimes this lotus headdress is augmented by two upright plumes and hvin necklace counterpoises 'Which hang at its sides. Occasionally Nefertem is also depicted as a lion

headed god (in reference to his leonine 'mother' Sekhmet) or standing on the back of a lion (perhaps also relating to his solar connections). In a few cases, depictions of Nefertem as a lion wearing his distinctive lotus headdress also are found. ·rhe god usually \vears a short kilt and may hold a khepesh sickle sword - perhaps in association with one of his epithets, khener tawy 'protector of the Two Lands'. Because of his association with the primeval creation myths Nefertem may be represented as a child seated on a lotus blossom, and a variation on this motif is found in examples vvhich show only the head of the god emerging from the lotus - as in the famous painted wooden example found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. In these images the association of l efertem and the infant sun god is particularly close, and such depictions might be seen as representing the king as one or the other, or even both of these deities.
Worship
Nefertem's mythological characteristics meant that he ,vas primarily a deity of royal and divine 1nonuments. He was not commonly worshipped and, in fact, was popularly more often feared as the son of the ferocious Sekhmet. Amuletic 'divine decrees' of the Third Intermediate Period, made when a child was born, thus often promise to protect the child from manifestations of Nefertem along with other deities who were considered potentially harmful. On the other hand, a few protective an1ulets depicting the god were also made in this period.
Shed
Mythology
Shed, 'I-le who rescues' or 'the enchanter', was a protective god venerated mainly from New Kingdom times, though he is attested earlier. He was the master of wild beasts of the desert and river as well as weapons of war so that he was believed to provide protection from dangerous animals and martial harm as well as against illness and inimical magic. Shed was connected with Horus, sometimes appearing in the form HorusShed, to the extent that by the Late Period he was largely subsumed by the greater god.
Iconography
Shed was depicted as a child or young man, usually with a shaved head except for the sidelock of youth, wearing a kilt and sometimes with a broad collar and with a quiver slung over his back. He usually grasps serpents and wild, symbolically noxious animals and stands on the back of one or more crocodiles - essentially the same iconographic
attributes found on cippi of Horus.
Worship
Shed \;vas primarily a god of popular religion without his own temples and cultic service. He is attested in personal names, and representations of the god on protective plaques, pendants, etc, are known from a variety of contexts. Two stelae dedicated to Shed were found in a chapel 1n the workmen's village at Amarna showing the god's popularity and persistence in even that restrictive period.
The protective child god Shed depicted grasping
serpents and wil.d animals and standing on crocodiles.

The temple of Amun at Karnak. Through the prominence of her husband Amun the goddess Amaunet achieved additional stature at Karnak, which became one of her most important cult sites.
Deities
Amaunet
Mythology
Amaunet, whose name means 'the female hidden one', was the consort of Amun and one of the eight Hern1opolitan gods (see p. 77) who represented aspects of the primordial existence before the time of creation. As this group of original powers consisted of four balanced pairs of male and ·female deities, and Amaunefs name is clearly derivative of that of her husband, it see1ns likely that she may have originally have been an artificially created complement to Amun rather than an independent deity. Mythologically, as the Pyramid Texts show, the shadow of Amun and Amaunet was a symbol of protection (PT 446), and it may have been for this reason that Amaunet entered the
ideology of royal ritual as a protective, tutelary
deity. The goddess appears in this ro le in the Akhmenu or festival hall of ~ruthmosis Ul at Karnak and in Ptolemaic times she was shown nursing the infant figure of Philip Arrhidaeus at her breast as part of scenes depicting the king's enthronement which were carved on the 1,,vall of Karnak's inner sanctuary. In a typical contortion of Egyptian mythology, Amaunet as 'mother of Re' could also be the mother of her own consort, Amun in the form of Amun-Re.
Iconography
ln representational \>VOrks Amaunet is usual1y depicted as a goddess in human form, wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt and carrying a papyrus-headed staff. The exact reason for this iconography is unclear, but at Karnak she is known to have been identified \Vith the goddess Neith whose cult centre was in the Delta region. A colossalstatue of the goddess set up in the temple of An1un at Karnak in the time of Tutakhamun is the most famous and imposing known representation of this goddess. A type of vulture amulet called 'amunet' is probab\y not to be connected with Amaunet and, like the goddess Mut, her representations are normally anthropomorphic.



Worship
Despite her probable or1g1ns as the female complement of Amun, at Thebes Amaunet ,vas overshadowed by Amun's other consort, Mut, since at least the time of Senwosret I (12th dynasty) in Middle Kingdom times. However, Amaunet is known to have had her own priests at Karnak and to have found some prominence in rituals associated vvith the king's accession and Sed or jubilee festivals. Although she does not seem to have been widely worshipped outside the Theban area, Amaunet did maintain her identity into the later dynasties of Egyptian history as an important local goddess.
Anat
Mythology
-'fhis goddess vvas one of a nun1ber of deities introduced into Egypt from the Near East. She vvas a warrior goddess particularly associated with the region of ancient Ugarit (modern Ras-Shamra) on the Syrian Levant; and although she was given titles such as 'mistress of the sky', and 'mother of the gods', Anat's nature was primarily martial. In the West Semitic myths relating to the goddess she ruthlessly sent an eagle to slay a youth named Aquat whose bow she coveted, and when she slevv the monster Mot whom she fought, she vengefully hacked and burned his body before grinding his bones and scattering them in the fields. She thus becan1e one of the patron deities of the military exploits of the Ramessid kings. A war hound of Ramesses II ,vas called 'Anat in strength' (one of the daughters of that pharaoh was also called BintAnat or 'daughter of Anat') and the goddess ,vas said to personally protect Ramesses III in battle. Anat was often referred to as a virgin, but she had a

strong sexual aspect and was said to have united with Reshep and ,vith Baal. In Egypt Anat was considered to be a daughter of Re and, like other Near Eastern goddesses, she was sometimes equated with Hathor - especially as the Egyptian deity could herself exhibit a violent aspect to her nature. Her aggression and foreign origin led to Anat being said to be one of the consorts of Seth, while her sexual aspect also led her to be associated with the fertility god Min.
Iconography
Representations of Anat usually reflect her mythological character, and she \.Vas characteristically depicted in the form of a vvoman holding a shield, spear and battle axe - often with one arm raised holding one of her vveapons in a threatening gesture. She normally ,vears a long dress and a high crown similar to the White Crown of Upper Egypt but flanked by plumes on either side. Her iconography can sometimes reflect elements of the goddess Hathor vvith whom she was associated.
Worship
Anat is first attested in Egypt towards the end of the Middle Kingdom, but she seems to have been favoured by the Hyksos during their period of rulership in Egypt (one of whose kings took the name Anat-her), and by Ramessid times Anat was established as a fairly important goddess in the Delta region. In the Third Intermediate Period a large precinct ,vas dedicated to the goddess in the temple of Mut at Tanis, and the nan1e Anat-em-heb or 'Anat in her festival' was a theophorous name taken by Egyptians analagous to the older Hor-e1n-heb or Amen-em-heb 'Horus/Amun in his Festival'. Although the goddess was often associated with Astarte, the cult of Anat was clearly practised independently.

Anukis
Mythology
Anukis was the goddess of the southern border region of Egypt and particularly the cataracts of the lower Nile in the region of Aswan. She \.Vas worshipped since at least Old Kingdom ti1nes as a daughter of Re, but in Middle Kingdom times she was incorporated into the triad of Elephantine as the offspring of Khnum and Satis. The goddess's name is difficult to interpret but may mean 'embracer' with either the meaning of motherly embrace or crushing, strangling grip. It is also possible that these meanings indicate a dual nature similar to the knovvn nature of Hathor - with whom Anukis vvas associated at Thebes. Like Hathor and certain other goddesses, Anukis was viewed in a mythologically maternal role towards the Egyptian king, and is sometimes given the epithet 'mother of the king'. The Greeks identified .A.nukis with Hestia, their goddess of the hearth.
Iconography
Representations of the goddess depict her as a wo1nan \.Vearing a headdress which consists of a low cro\;vn surmounted with a row of bound plumes, sometimes with streamers at the rear or a

uraeus at the front. In addition to the ubiquitous
ankh, the goddess is often shovvn holding a papyrus sceptre. Her sacred animal was the gazelle, and she is sometimes depicted with this animal or by means of it. In her maternal role she is sometimes shown nursing the figure of the king, as in the small Nubian temple of Beit eJ-Wali.
Worship
In addition to the cult centres she shared with J(hnum and Satis at Elephantine and Aswan, there was a temple dedicated to Anukis a little to the south of Aswan on the island of Sehel at the first cataract. She was worshipped throughout most of lower Nubia and appears in monu1nents such as the temple of Beit el-Wali along with other deities of the region. The popularity of the goddess is also attested in both male and female personal names such as 'beloved of Anukis' and '[he]of Anukis'.
Astarte
Mythology
Astarte was the \i\Test Sen1itic counterpart of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar (the Sumerian lnanna) worshipped in IVIesopotamia. Like Ishtar, she had both a benevolent and a terrifying aspect - she was a goddess of love and fertility, but also of war. This latter aspect was dominant in the goddess's SyroCanaanite manifestation - she appears as a war goddess in the Hebrew Bible (1 Samuel 31) and entered Egypt in this guise during the New [{ingdom where she vvas particularly linked to the rnilitary use of chariots and horses. She is ,nentioned on the Sphinx Stela set up by Amenophis 11 (perhaps her first appearance in Egyptian texts) as being delighted with the young prince's equestrian skill and, like the Syrian goddess Anat, was believed to protect the pharaoh's chariot in battle. She was adopted into the Egyptian pantheon as a daughter of Re (or sometimes Ptah) and \.vife of the god Seth with whose fearsome and bellicose nature she could easily be equated. According to the frag1nentary 19th-dynasty story of Astarte and the Sea, the goddess seems to have been involved in thvvarting the demands of the tyrannical sea god Yam, though the details of this myth are lost to us. While the sexual aspect of Astarte does not seem to have been as pronounced in Egyptian religion as in her Canaanite homeland, it was probably not entirely absent in her Egyptian mythology.
Iconography
In Egypt, Astarte ,.vas usually portrayed as a naked woman on horseback brandishing vveapons and v.,earing an Atef Crown (seep. 121) or a headdress with bull's horns. According to the Classical writer Philo, Astarte wore the horns of a bull as a sy1nbol of domination; but Mesopotamian and Syrian gods



and goddesses co1nmonly wore horns as a sign of their divinity, so this attribute may not have had any special significance with Astarte. A number of depictions of an otherwise unidentified goddess vvearing a horned helmet - as on ostraca found at the workmen's village of Deir el-Medina - may well represent this goddess.
Worship
A formal temple of Astarte existed in the Ramessid capital of Pi-Ramesse in the Delta, and there were doubtless a number of temples where the goddess was incorporated into the existing cult, such as that found at San el-Hagar, the ancient Tanis, where Astarte is known to have been worshipped along with the Egyptian deities Mut and Khonsu. While there is not a great deal of evidence from Egypt of the popular veneration of Astarte - as opposed to expressions of her tutelary role as a military deity votive stelae showing worship of the goddess are known, and the appearance of her image or name on scarabs and ostraca may also indicate a level of popular acceptance.
Baa/at
Baalat was goddess of the Canaanite and West Semitic area and fen1inine counterpart of the storm god Baal. Baalat n1eans 'lady' or 'mistress' and like the word baal is often equated with a locality as in
the title 'Baalat Gebel' - 'lady of Byblos'. In Egypt, the goddess was associated with Hathor probably because they were both linked vvith the products and resources of the region to the northeast of Egypt and also because of the Canaanite deity's proclivity for sexuality. At Dendera Hathor was in fact described as residing at Byblos. In the small temple of Hathor located at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai, a sandstone sphinx was dedicated with both the name of Hathor in hieroglyphs and the name of Baalat in an early Semitic alphabetic script. Worship or recognition of Baalat in Egypt may have gone back as far as the tin1e of the cedar vvood trade with Lebanon during the reign of the 3rddynasty king Sneferu. I-Iowever her assimilation with Hathor meant that she was rarely regarded as an independent deity and ,vas probably of most interest to Egyptians working or trading in the outlying regions where she was co1nmonly found.

dynastic times, though most of the evidence for her dates to later periods. While she appears infrequently in the Pyramid Texts, she is of great importance in the Coffin Texts and later religious literature and is eventually found in so many contexts that only the most important can be considered here.
Mother or wife of Horus: The name Hathor was written as a composite hieroglyph showing a falcon within the hieroglyphic sign representing a walled building or courtyard and literally means 'the house of Horus', relating to the goddess's mythological role as mother of the ancient falcon god. Though this may not have been her original name, it clearly became one of the most important aspects of her identity and it is as the mother of the god or as his consort that Hathor was worshipped in her main cult centre at Dendera and elsewhere. Hathor was also protective and healing in this role, with her healing aspect probably a result of the myth in which the goddess restored the sight of Horus after his eye had been injured by Seth.
Sky goddess: Fron1 the written form of her name as the house of Horus - Hathor may also be seen as the sky in which the great falcon lived or, alternatively, as the womb, metaphorically referred to as 'house', from which he was born. In this form, Hathor was both a solar sky-goddess and a goddess of the primeval sky-waters (see below), and she may also have functioned as a personification of the night-time sky or the Milky Way, though this aspect of the goddess is less clear. But her connection with the sky is obvious, and in the Pyramid Texts she is equated in this guise with the clothing of the ascendant king who states 'My kilt which is on me is Hathor, my plume is a falcon's plume and I will ascend to the sky....' (PT 546) - referring to both Hathor and Horus as sky deities.
Wife or daughter and 'eye' of Re: Hathor was closely connected with the sun god Re whose disk she 1.vears and whose wife, 'Eye' or daughter she was said to be. It has been suggested that the goddess was 'created' as a consort for the sun god as he rose to power at the beginning of the Old Kingdom, which fits well with much of the evidence we have of a relative1y unknown goddess who is suddenly propelled into importance. Thus, Hathor played an important role in the royal sun temples of the later Old Kingdom, and her mythological relationship with the sun god was firmly established. As the 'Golden One' she was the resplendent goddess who accompanied the sun god on his daily journey in the solar barque, and she could also be feared as the vengeful
'Eye' of Re as seen in the story of the narrowly averted destruction of the human race by Hathor in her rage. In the Pyramid Texts Hathor assists the king in this ro1e of 'Eye', however (PT 705) - preserving him by enabling his daily rebirth vvith the sun.
Cow goddess: Although Hathor is most probably not the cow-deity depicted at the top of the Narmer Palette as is often stated (see Bat), or the deity whose standard was the skull of a cow mounted upon a pole in predynastic times, an ivory engraving from the 1st dynasty
depicting a recumbent COvV a
inscribed 'Hathor in the " ' marshes of King Djer's city of Dep' seems to reflect an early use of bovine imagery for the goddess. In any event, Hathor's i bovine form is central to her



developed persona and it is in this form that she must be related to the primeval cow goddess MehetWeret, whom she seems to have assimilated by Middle Kingdom times. In her bovine form Hathor also protected the king and acted as a royal nurse, symbolically suckling the monarch even as an adult. The so-called 'seven Hathors' found in the Book of the Dead and elsewhere vvere aspects of the goddess usually depicted as seven cows (seep. 77).
Goddess of ioomen, female sexuality and motherhood: I-Iathor was often described as the 'beautiful one' and was inextricably associated with love and female sexuality as well as with motherhood. Not surprisingly, the Greeks identified I-fathor with Aphrodite and the goddess was especially venerated by Egyptian women. Mythologically, Hathor vvas perhaps chief among those goddesses who represented the female creative principle who were called the 'hand of Atum', in reference to the story of Atum copulating with himself at the time of

creation. Her overt sexuality is seen in the story which recounts how l-Iathor cheered the dejected god Re by exposing herself so that the great god laughed and rejoined the company of the gods. One of her names was 'mistress of the vagina', and Hathor was associated with all aspects of motherhood and believed to assist women in conception, labour and childbirth.
Mother or wife of the king: A particularly important aspect of Hathor's maternal nature is the role she played as the mother of the king, which was often expressed by means of her identity as the nurturing bovine goddess discussed above. The Egyptian king was called the 'son of Hathor' perhaps both in this sense and also in the sense that I-Iathor was the mother of the falcon god Horus whose incarnation the reigning king was. Hathor was also the 'wife' of the king fron1 an early date, and already in the 4th dynasty we find the king's chief wife acting as her priestess and probably being viewed as the earthly n1anifestation of the

goddess. The relationship bet\veen Hathor and the king is particularly clear in the famous sculptural \vorks from Menkaure's mortuary temple at Giza dep icting Hathor with the king, which depict the goddess both in the role of a wife stood next to her husband and as a seated mother figure. iVluch later, in Ne\v Kingdom times, Hathor still remained a potent deity with whom royal wives were associated.
Goddess of foreign lands and their goods: In addition to her purely Egyptian roles, Hathor \Vas also made a goddess of foreign lands as far apart as Byblos in the Lebanon in the north and Punt (probably northern Eritrea) in the south. As the patroness of foreign regions she oversaw trade and the acquisition of many mineral and other resources \von from the deserts. In the Sinai, for exan1ple, the Egyptians 1nined turquoise, copper and malachite from the beginning of the Old Kingdom till Ne,v Kingdom times, and it vvas Hathor who acted as the protector and patroness of these remote mining areas. At such sites in the Wadi Maghara and later at Serabit el-Khadim and elsewhere, Hathor was ::;pecifically v.rorshipped as 'the mistress of turquoise'. By extension, based on the similarity of colour, Hathor was also called 'mistress of faience'.
Goddess of the afterlife: vVomen aspired to be assimilated ,vith Hathor in the afterlife in the same manner that men desired to 'become' Osiris, but the goddess's relationship to the deceased applied to n1en and \.vomen alike. From quite early times, especially in the i\liemphite region, she \vas \vorshipped as a tree goddess, 'mistress,of the sycamore', who 3Upplied food and drink to the deceased; and from at least the 18th dynasty she served as the patron deity of the Theban necropolis, where she protected and nurtured royalty and comn1oners alike, either in the form of the cow or as the anthropomorphic •mistress of the west' who vvas often depicted welcorning the deceased to the afterlife \vith purifying and refreshing vvater.She \;vas considered to receive the dying sun each evening and so it was a desire of the deceased to be 'in the follovving of Hathor'.
Goddiiss of joy, music and happiness: Although closely related to Hathor's aspect as a goddess of fertility, sexuality and love, her role as a provider of pleasure and joy \Vas independent in itself. In a similar manner, while Hathor's relationship with music vvas clearly cultic in cases such as the ritual use of her rattle-like sistrum, it 1,vas also present in the use of music for the purposes of popular festivity and pleasure. Hathor was also associated vvith alcoholic beverages \Vhich seem to have been used extensively in her festivals, and the image of the goddess is often found on vessels made to contain \Vine and beer. Hathor was thus known as the mistress of drunkenness, of song, and of myrrh, and it is cer

tainly likely that these qualities increased the goddess's popularity from Old Kingdo1n times and ensured her persistence throughout the rest of Egypt's ancient history.
Iconography
Hathor was most often represented in anthropomorphic form as a \,vornan wearing a long \Vig bound by a filet, or with a vulture cap with a low modius, surmounted by a sun disk between outward curving co\.v horns. In this form, in late representations, she is often indistinguishable from Isis, \vho took over many of her attributes and can only be identified by inscription. In her guise as mistress of the \Vest Hathor wears a falcon perched upon a pole which served as the hieroglyphic sign for \vest'. Often she is depicted in a turquoise or red sheath dress or in a

garment combining these colours. and at Edfu she is specifically called 'mistress of the red cloth'. She is one of the few goddesses to be depicted carrying the iuas sceptre. and she may hold a papyrus stem or sistrum as a personal attribute. But the goddess could also be represented in bovine form as the 'great \,vild cow', as a ,,voman \Vith the head of a co,.v, or as a composite human-bovine face. Hathor was particularly venerated in fully bovine form in
the Theban area where we find monarchs such as
Amenophis II, Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III depicted crouching under the belly of the CO\V goddess drinking from her udder, or standing before her bovine in1age. In the san1e area we also find Hathor depicted as a cow emerging from a papyrus thicket at the foot of the western mountain of Thebes. Usually only the head and neck of the cow are depicted in this form of the goddess and the motif is clearly expressed in the elegant gilded head of a cow found in the tomb of Tutankhamun which doubtless represented this aspect of Hathor. When depicted in the form of a pillar, Hathor's image \,vas a fusion of bovine and human characteristics. The capital of the pillar was formed as an essentially female face, but it was triangular in shape to incorporate the face of a cow and \Vitb a cow's ears and a wig which curls at each side - perhaps in imitation of the bicornate uterus of the cow. In some contexts Hathor could also be represented in other zoomorphic forms - primarily as a lioness, or as a serpent, and even in plant form as a papyrus plant or sycamore tree.
Worship
The origins of the worship of Hathor are difficult to pinpoint. If she is not the goddess represented by the standard of the 7th Upper Egyptian nome, as seems likely, then the site later called Diospolis Parva (modern Hivv) ,.vas not a cult centre of the goddess from the Predynastic Period, as is son1etimes suggested. The ivory artifact of the 1st dynasty mentioned above see1ns to show the antiquity of Hathor's vvorship, however. A temple of the goddess ,;vhich continued through Roman times \Vas first built at Gebelein (called by the Greeks Aphroditopolis) in the 3rd dynasty; and in the Old Kingdom several temples of the goddess are mentioned in the annals recorded on the Palermo Stone. The southern side of the valley ten1ple of Khafre (Chephren) at Giza is known to have been dedicated to Hathor, and the title 'priestess of Hathor' becomes common from the 4th dynasty on. As time progressed, temples dedicated to Hathor vvere built throughout Egypt and also beyond Egypt's borders in Nubia, the n1ining regions of the Sinai, Byblos and other areas of Egyptian influence and control. In Egypt proper, in1portant ternples to Hathor vvere established at Atfih (also called Aphroditopolis by the Greeks), at Cusae, Deir el-TVledina, and Dendera, her greatest cult centre. The annual high point of the developed cult of Hathor was the sacred marriage \vhich took place bet,veen the goddess and Horus of Eclfu in the third month of the summer season. Fourteen days before the appearance of the nev.1 moon, the statue of the goddess ,vas taken from her shrine at Dendera and began the procession to the temple of Horus son1e 70 km (33 miles) to the south. Eventually, on reaching Edfu during the day before the nevv moon, the statues of Hathor and



Horus participated in various rituals before being placed in the birth house where they spent the night together. For the next 14 days the celebrations vvhich followed this divine marriage represented one of the greatest religious festivals of ancient Egypt in which royalty, nobles and commoners alike participated. From the 18th dynasty till the end of the Dynastic Period Hathor-head amulets are common. A1nuletic figures depicting a \Valking or seated goddess holding a papyrus sten1 appear beginning in the Third Intermediate Period and may represent Hathor or Isis, though those showing the goddess with a cow's head certainly depict Hathor. In addition to these amulets and charms, nlany items oi daily use, such as mirrors, perfume containers and cosmetic items, were decorated with the figure or symbols of Hathor according to her various roles. She was also commonly represented on ex voto objects, such as statues, stelae and offering vessels, vvhich wese left at her shrines and sacred areas as gifts and as requests for specific blessings. In her roleas deity of sexuality and fertility, ,vooden and stone phalli vvere dedicated to Ha thor and in at least one of her festivals a 1nodel phallus \Vas carried in procession in forma I reference to this aspect of her nature. However, just as Hathor simply cannot be delimited in any of the individual fonns or aspects described above, her worship ,vas also often diverse
and difficult to generalize. It must also be
remembered that the ,vorship of Hathor ,vas so \Videspread that she ,vas often regarded as a form of the indigenous deity in localities where she originally had no cult of her ovvn. In this ,;vay, at Thebes Hathor was identified with Mut, and at Elephantine \Vith Sothis. Despite the fact that by the end of Egypt's history Hathor ,vas often assimilated v,;ith the goddess Isis, there remain many instances \vhere the ancient deity still 1naintained her identity and continued to be venerated by the Egypt1ans with great affection.

Isis
'Tvlighty one, fore1nost of the goddesses Ruler in heaven, Queen on earth... All the gods are under her command.'
From an inscription at Philae
Mythology
Theorigins of Isis, who in the later periods of history was tobecome Egypt's most important goddess, are shrouded in obscurity. Unlike the situation with so many deities, no town in Egypt claimed to be her place of origin or the location of her burial and there are actually no certain attestations of her before the 5th dynasty. Yet she is clearly of great importance in the Pyramid Texts vvhere she appears over 80 times assisting the deceased king.
In the funerary texts of later periods her protective and sustaining roles were extended to nobles and commoners and her povver and appeal grew to the point that she eventually eclipsed Osiris himself and was venerated by virtually every Egyptian. As ti1ne passed, and her importance gre,:v, Isis merged \1/ith n1any other goddesses including Astarte, Bastet, Nut, Renenutet and Sothis, but her most important native syncretism was vvith Hathor fro1n 1,,vhom she took many of her iconographic attributes and mythological characteristics. Co1npared \Vith some of Egypt's early cosmic goddesses, the mythological roles played by Isis are relatively restricted, yet they are immensely important roles which together personified her as a goddess of great power whose relationship with her follo\.vers vvas a personal one extending from this life into the after!ife itself.
Sister-wife of Osiris: According to the theology of the Heliopolitan sun cult, Isis and Osiris were both the children of Geb and Nut (see p. 18), but Isis beca1ne the wife of her brother and assisted him in ruling Egypt during his mythological kingship on earth. The myths concerning the hvo deities are extensive, and the fullest account is found in Plutarch's De !side et Osiride, but after Osiris' death and dismemberment at the hands of his enemy Seth, Isis, along with her sister Nephthys, mourned inconsolably and began to search for her husband. Eventually the goddess found her husband's scat· terecl parts and reunited his body (or in another version, she found his body enclosed in the trunk of a tree). Through her rnagic Isis revivified the sexual member of Osiris and became pregnant by him, eventually giving birth to their child, Horus. This underlying mythological role as the wife of Osiris is the basis of the importance of the goddess in all of her other aspects.
[\I/other and protector of Horus: A number of myths elaborate ho\.v Isis fled from Seth to the marshes of the Delta \vhere she gave birth to her
son Horus (see p. 201) at Khemnis or Akh-bity which means 'papyrus thicket of the king of Lower Egypt'. The Egyptians made literally hundreds of thousands of statues and amulets of the infant Horus nursing on his mother's lap in celebration of this mythic 1nother-child relationship sho,ving the importance of the goddess's role as mother of Horus. After the birth of Horus various dangers threatened the young god, but throughout them Isis steadfastly cared for her son.She gained hea1ing for him in one instance from a potentially lethal scorpion sting, which became the mythological basis for her healing powers and those associated ·with the so-called cippi or healing plaques of Horus the child. Isis continued to nurture and protect Horus unti\ he was o1d enough to avenge h1s father and gain his rightful inheritance as king of all Egypt.



J.1other of the king: As the \vife of Osiris and mother of Horus, Isis was also the symbolic mother
of the king \vho symbolically was the incarnation of the latter god. As ear1y as the Pyramid Texts it is Mid that the king drinks milk from the breasts of his 'mother' lsis (PT 2089, etc.), and pharaohs of the \ ev1 Kingdom and later periods had themselves depicted verbally and visually as the son of Isis. Because the goddess's name \vas ,-vritten by means :>f the hieroglyphic sign for 'seat' or 'throne', it is possible that she originally "vas the personification lf the power of the throne. Though many scholars :eel that this may have been a later development, :SOme have stressed that among son1e African tribes
~he throne of the chieftain is kno\vn as the mother of ~l-ie king. and this anthropological insight fits well ""·ith what we know of the goddess.
Goddess of cosmic associations: Although not orig:na!ly a cosmic goddess, the great importance of '.sis nevertheless led to several cosmic associations being made for her. She assumed the role of the ·Eye' of Re and according to Plutarch she was also ;·enerated as a moon goddess, though it is more difficult to find substantiation for this claim. Isis was, r:o\vever, closely equated with the star Sirius, just as Osiris was equated with the constellation Orion. In j)is role she merged with the goddess Sothis and \\·as so1netimes called lsis-Sothis. At the height of her development, as may be seen in the hymns dedil'.ated to her in her temple at Philae, Isis was also :..senbed povvers of cosmic proportions. One hymn,
-~
which is not atypical, states that 'She is the Lady
of Heaven, Earth and the Nethervvorld, having brought them into existence...'; and in a late aretalogy or list of her virtues, Isis is made to say, 'J separated the Earth from the Heaven, I showed the paths of the stars, I regulated the course of the sun and moon:
Great of magic: Magic is central to Isis' many roles, for it is through magic that Osiris was revived, Horus conceived and protected, and the deceased \vhether royal or commoner - assisted in the afterlife. The magic of Isis was also invoked in many spells for protection and healing - often in1ploring the goddess to come to the aid of a child or individual as if he or she "vere l-Iorus himself. Most of the myths relating to the goddess stress her magical abi lity and one in particular - in which she learns the true name of Re - stresses her position as the greatest of the gods in terms of magical knowledge and power. In this myth Isis creates a snake \,vhich bites Re, and the stricken sun god is only healed of the snake's venom when he reveals his true name to her and thus further enhances her power.
Mourner, sustainer and protector of tlie deceased: Along vvith her sister Nephthys, Isis represents the archetypal image of the mourner in Egyptian literature and art. Both goddesses are mythically equated \Vith the kite, a bird of prey with a particularly shrill piercing cry which has been thought to have been suggestive of the cries of \vomen \.Vailing

in mourning. The kite is also essentially a scavenging rather tban hunting bird of prey that often wanders looking for carrion, and it is in this fortn that Isis was said to have searched for her murdered husband. The goddess "vas more than just a mourner, however, and through her great power Isis was able to function as the protector and sustainer of the deceased in the afterlife. Even in the Pyramid Texts she is said to care for the deceased, as she did for her O\vn son Horus, and in the later periods of Egyptian history Isis becomes the suprerne deity in this capacity, caring for the deceased in a personal \vay based on her character as a devoted 1nother.
Icono g raphy
Isis is represented anthropomorphically in the form of a woman 1Nearing a long sheath dress and cro\.1,1ned with either the hieroglyphic 'throne' sign which represents her name or, beginning in the 18th dynasty and most commonly in the later dynastic periods, with the horns and solar disk which she
appropriated from Hathor. The attributes she frequently holds, the sistrum rattle and menat necklace, were also taken aver from Hath.or, but lsis often holds only the generic ankh sign and papyrus staff co1nmonly depicted with other goddesses. While her most commonly depicted representational pose sho\.vs her standing upright, Isis is also depicted kneeling - often with her hand resting on the shen or eternity sign. In either of these positions the goddess may be shovvn in the guise of a rnourner with one hand lifted to her face. Often her arn1s are outstretched and placed around the seated or standing figure of Osiris and sometimes her arn1s are winged. She is depicted in this rnanner on the sides or corners of royal sarcophagi of the 18th dynasty and instatues or representations where she shelters and supports Osiris. In one knovvn instance a figure of Isis protecting an image of herself personifies the protective nature of the goddess. Isis may also be represented as a scorpion, in fully avian form, as a kite, and as a mother goddess she may be depicted



as a SO\:V or in bovine form - in the latter case an analog1.1e of Hathor or as the mother of the Apis bull. Finally, Isis could also be depicted in the form
of a tree goddess, as in the tornb of Tuthmosis III in the Valley of the Kings ,vhere she appears as a personified tree, nursing the king at her breast vvhich descends from one of the tree's branches. Amuletic depictions of Isis - usually in anthropomorphic form - or the symbol often called the Isis knot and known by the Egyptians as the tyet, vvere frequently placed on the mummy from New Kingdo1n times, and the goddess's protective power \vas doubtless
utilized in amulets carried by many Egyptians in life also.
Worship
For a good part of Egyptian history it seems that Isis was not usually associated \vith any particular locality or \.VOrshipped in her own ten1ples. Rather she ,vas incorporated into the temples of other deities Vi.Tith ,vhom she \Vas associated. There are minor exceptions such as the chapel of Isis 'Mistress of the Pyramid' constructed at Giza in the 21st dynasty. Ho\.vever, the first important temple ~mown to have been dedicated to the goddess, the Iseion - her temple at Behbeit el-Hagar in the eastern Delta - was not beg1.1n until the reign of :-Jectanebo II in the 30th dynasty, and only co1npleted under Ptolemy III. Even here, as in her other later sanctuaries, Isis was venerated along with Osiris and Horus as was probably the case in earlier
shrines which existed on the site. Other important chapels and temples of Isis vvere built at Dendera \vhere the goddess was honoured by Augustus ,vith a s111all independent sanctuary. This was at Deir elShelwit just south of Thebes vvhere a small temple \Vas also constructed for her in Roman times, and in her most famous temple on the island of Philae \1i1ich vvas begun by Nectanebo I and grew under a :series of Ptolemaic rulers and Roman emperors. The hyn1ns inscribed there identify Isis 1,,vith many other goddesses and shovv that she had successfully absorbed them as 'Isis in all her manifestations'.She \\·as thus invoked in many spells of the later dynas
ties often tailored to her 01,,vn character, as in spells and love chan11s to make a vvoman love a man as Isis loved Osiris, or to make a \voman hate her present partner as Isis hated Seth. Her influence ,vas amazingly \Videspread. There \\·as a te1nple of Isis at Byblos, where the goddess \,·as equated \-vith the local for1n of Astarte. from quite early times, though it is not known for certain \\·hether the myth of Osiris' body being ,x;ashed ashore at that site and the subsequent visit of Isis predates actual Isis worship at Byblos or not. Later, the worship of Isis became widespread in the Graeco-Roman worlds as one of the Eastern ·mystery religions', and the ClassicaI writer _-\puleius left a detailed description of the initiations into her cult. Evidence of veneration of the goddess
has been found as far apart as Iraq and England, \vith temples being built to Isis in Athens and other Greek cities and later in many parts of the Roman Empire as \veil as in Rorne itself. The cult of Isis rivalled those of the traditional Greek and Roman gods, and its importance and persistence is seen in the fact that her \VOrship continued at Philae until the 6th century AD - long after most of Egypt and the ,vider Roman world had been converted to Christianity.

/unit
A goddess of mainly localized importance in the Theban region, Iunit was incorporated into the local ennead of Karnak in New Kingdom tin1es. Along with the goddess Tjenenyet, she was venerated as the consort of the ancient falcon \var god Montu
(see p. 203) in the town of Armant (Hermonthis) a little to the south of Thebes. Her name means 'Sheof-Armant', and although the goddess first appears in reliefs dated to the reign of Mentuhotep III of the 11th dynasty, it is thought that she may have been \VOrshippecl there from very early times. It is perhaps possible, though not likely, that she is the goddess of the same name mentioned in the Pyramid Texts (PT 1066). The female deity Raet, also known from the Tbeban region, seems to be related to Iunit and may possibly represent a solar aspect of the goddess of Armant.
lusaas
Iusaas \Vas a Heliopolitan goddess whose na1ne seems to mean 'she comes who is great' and who functioned as a feminine counterpart of the male solar-creator principle personified by Atu.m. Because of these associations Iusaas is depicted in anthropomorphic form as a woman with a scarab beetle upon her head. Like Nebet-hetepet (seep. 156) whom she resembles in function and who may be a different form of the same goddess, Iusaas played an important theological role as the embodiment of the female creative principle but was not important in terms of cultic activity or worship.
Khefthernebes
A minor goddess, Kbefthernebes was a divine personification of the region of the Theban necropolis in New I{ingdom ti1nes. She was overshadowed, ho,~1ever, by other femaJe deities of the region such as Imentet, fVIeretseger and Hathor.
Maat
Mythology
The goddess Maat personified the concepts of truth, justice and cosmic order (Egyptian maat). She is known to have existed at least from the Old Kingdom and is mentioned in the Pyramid Texts where she is said to stand behind the sun god Re (P'f 1582, passim), though it is not until the New Kingdom that we have evidence of her being called the 'daughter of Re'. Thegoddess was also associated with Osiris - who is said to be 'lord of 1naaf at an early date - and in later times she was subsumed to
some extent by Isis, although according to Egyptian mythology the husband of Maat \.vas usually said to be the scribal god Thoth. As the daughter of Re Maat was also the sister of the reigning king who was the 'son of Re', and the relationship of the goddess with the king was a vital one. Both the monarch's legititnation and the efficacy of his reign were ultimately based upon the degree to which he upheld maat and it was common therefore fo r kings to style themselves 'beloved of Maat'. Her role was multifaceted but embraced two major aspects. On the one hand, Maat represented the universal order or balance - including concepts such as truth and right - which \Vas established at the time of creation. This aspect is the basis of her relationship with Re - for she is the order imposed upon the cosmos created by the solar demiurge and as such is the guiding principle who accompanied the sun god at all times. The order represented by Maat must be renewed or preserved constantly, however, leading to the ritual presentation of l\1aat discussed below. As a natural corollary of her identity vvith right balance and harmony ~1aat also actively represented the concept of judgrr1ent. In the Pyramid Texts the goddess appears in this role in
dual form, as 'the two Maats' judging the deceased king's right to the thrones of Geb (PT 317), and in the later fu nerary literature it is in the 'Hall of the tv-10 Truths' (the dual form of Maat) that the judg
ment of the deceased occurs. The gods themselves,
acting as the judges of the divine tribunal, are called the 'council of Maat'.
Iconography
Maat was almost always depicted in fully anthropomorphic form as a goddess wearing a tall feather on her head. The feather alone could represent the goddess, hovvever, as could the hieroglyphic sign also used to write her name which resembled a builder's measure or the plinth upon which statues of the gods \Vere placed. In representations of the king presenting Maat to the gods, the dirninutive image of the goddess is sometimes depicted in such a manner as to form a rebus of the name of the king himself. This is the case when Ramesses II presents the goddess holding a 'User' staff and crowned with a solar disk of Re in adclition to her own tall plume in order to spell the king's throne name: User-MaatRa. In the vignettes from the funerary papyri and in other depictions Maat is featured in the ceremony of the weighing of the heart of the deceased on the scales of judgment. Usually the heart is depicted being vveighed against the feather of Maat or in some cases a small image of the crouching goddess, and the figure of Maat sometimes surmounts the balance scale itself.

sanctuaries for the formal \.vorship of the goddess are uncommon and 1\tlaat is usually depicted in the temples of other deities. Even the title ·priest of Yv1aat' is often regarded as an honourific which may have been given to those \Vho served as magistrates or ,-vho dispensed judicial decisions on her behalf and \.Vho apparently v.rore small golden images of the goddess as a sign of their judicial authority. Theologically, the most important n)anifestation of the veneration of the goddess vvas the king's ritual presentation of a sn,all figure of fVIaat in the temples of the gods. In the Nevv Kingdom i\!Iaat \Vas offered especially to Amun, Re and Ptah, though she was also sometimes presented to her husband Thoth and was in effect offered to all the gods. Erik Hornung has pointed out that the equivalence of the presentation of the goddess ,vith all other offerings can be seen in epithets of i\1aat such as 'food of the gods' and 'clothing' and 'breath', as ,..vell as in other statements vvhich affirm that the gods 'live on i\!laat'. Likevvise En1ily Teeter has sho1,vn that most examples of the king presenting i\1aat are essentially identical to those in \.Vhich the king presents food, wine or other forms of sustenance to the gods. At another level, the offering of the image of the goddess was also a tangible expression of the king's
offering of his O\Vn work of maintaining maat in preserving order and justice on behalf of the gods.

life according to Egyptian belief. Beyond presiding over an individual's birth, the goddess was said to decide the life destiny of the child. The Westcar Papyrus describes ho,v the goddess assured the infants Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare, the first three kings of the 5th dynasty, that they would all con1e to rule Egypt. i\!Ieskhenet also played a role in rhe afterlife. She is often depicted in funerary vignettes close to the scales upon which the deceased's heart \.\las weighed - in order to assist in the rebirth Jf the individual entering the afterlife.
Iconography
The iconography of this goddess depicts her in the r Jrm of a rectangular brick (upon ,vhich ancient Egyptian women squatted to give birth) with the !:ead of a woman at one end. She may also be depicted anthropomorphically as a 1.voman with a brick upon her head, though this forrn is less co1nmonly found. A symbol hav ing tvvo loops at the top of a vertical stroke vvhich vvas used to represent the goddess almost certainly depicted the stylized uterus of the cow.
Worship
:\.lrhough without a forma l cult, l\lleskhenet 1vvas _n in1portant household deity and is mentioned in ~ number of kn0\1/11 hymns and prayers. A text :-1 the temple of Esna mentions four protective ~leskhenets associated with the creator god ~hnu111, but apart from this there are few instances i the goddess's presence in ten1ple settings except n ritual birth scenes.
Mut
Mythology
i\!lut ,-vas the great mother and queen of the gods ,vho ruled in Thebes. Her origins are somewhat uncertain and while she is not known in textual or representational sources before the end of the Middle I{ingdom, she n1ay have been established in the 1'heban region or elsewhere at an earlier date. Some Egyptologists believe that lVIut \vas virtually 'invented' as a ,vife for Amun vvhile others feel that she was more likely a minor or little known deity vvho rose to prominence alongside the god. At some point, ho\vever, fv'Iut displaced Arnaunet, the original consort of An1un, to become the god's chief i,.vife and the adopted mother of Khonsu in the great Theban triad. The goddess's name, vvhich 1vvas \vritten ,vith the hieroglyphic depiction of the griffin vulture (Gyps fulvus), n1ay possibly represent her earliest form, but this is doubtful as the \Vord mut and the vulture used to ,,vrite it mean 'mother' and this deity was regarded both generally as a mother goddess and as the .mother of the king in particular. She was also identified with the Egyptian queen, and in the Nevv Kingdo1n queens usually \.I/ore headdresses made in the form of the vulture which ,vere also symbolic of divine motherhood. Fron1 at least New Kingdo1n ti1nes, however, the prin1ary n1ythological association of Mur 1,,vas ,vith the lioness. In this form she ,vas the southern counterpart of the northern lioness goddess Sekhmet

and \Vas also related to the cat goddess Bastet \vith \Vhom she was joined as Mut-Bastet. Her leonine aspect also made her one of the goddesses regarded as a savage 'Eye of Re' along with Sekhmet, 'fefnut and others. She \vas associated ,vith Re in other ways and part of a ritual in her honour asserts that she vvas present 'at the splitting of the ished tree together \Vith Re in Heliopolis'. Mut was also associated \vith the god Ptah of Memphis. Unlike most of Egypt's other major goddesses Mut played relatively little part in funerary beliefs, and her mythological sphere of influence vvas 1nainly centred on the world of the living. Nevertheless, she is described in some versions of Chapter 164 of the Book of the Dead as a goddess who delivers souls and bodies from 'the abode of the demons \Vhich are in the evil chamber', showing her power could also extend to the netber\vorld. A final aspect of i\ilut's absolute and rather terrifying po\ver is seen in the fact that by the latter part of the New Kingdom rebels and traitors who plotted against the king \vere destroyed by fire in the brazier of Mut - perhaps portraying a goddess who not only protected the person of the king but also the state itself with a power \Vhich \Vas as fierce as it was final.
Iconography
Although the earliest kno\vn representation of Mut - dating to around 1700 BC - depicts her as a lioness-headed goddess, her primary representational form in later times was anthropomorphic. In this female human form i\/Iut is depicted wearing a dress often brightly coloured in red or blue and marked with a pattern suggestive of feathers. She is distinguished by the vulture headdress surmounted by either the White Crown of Upper Egypt or the Double Crown of the con1bined Two Lands - the only goddess usually depicted in this composite crown. In this form she rnay be depicted standing or enthroned - often holding a papyrus or lily-headed staff - with Amun and l(honsu (see illus. p. 30) or, in seated representations, nursing an infant to symbolize her motherly role. She is represented in this manner in many amulets, though these can usually only be distinguished from similar amulets of Isis by the presence of the crowns or an inscriptional label. Because of her leonine aspect IVIut was son1etimes depicted as lion-headed and is in essence linked \vith Sekhn1et in the n1any famous lion-headed statues of that goddess that were placed in the precincts of the temple of lVIut at Karnak. Interestingly, this leonine aspect is also 1nirrored in some images of Amun, as in one of the side chapels of the temple of Khonsu at Karnak where he ,vas depicted in lion-headed, ithyphallic form. In some vignettes to Chapter 164 of the Book of the Dead, beginning in the 21st dynasty, Mut is also depicted as a composite deity \vith outstretched wings, an erect phallus and three heads those of a vulture, lion and human. These some



\vhat bizarre images represented an aggressive deity 'mightier than the gods'. Dedications to the goddess in the milder form of cat statuettes \Vere extre1nely common, and a wellkno,vn informal Ne\v Kingdom painting \Vbich sho\vs a cat vvith its arm around the neck of a goose perhaps also playfully suggests the familial rela
tionship behveen Amun-whosesacred animal \Vas the goose - and rviut in her feline form. It is interesting, ho\.vever, that although Mut maintained her position as consort of A1nun, in 'official' representations the relationship between the deities appears more familial than sexual. In sexual or fertilityrelated scenes Amun is portrayed with other 'younger' goddesses such as Isis and Hathor, but in formal scenes of power or matters of state it is Mut who is enthroned as the mature mother figure and powerful queen of the gods.

in chapels and representations in many other temples throughout Egypt, Mut maintained a level of independence, and the goddess's main cult centre v-1as her o,vn 'Isheru' precinct to the south of I<.arnak Temple. The major part of her temple \Vas constructed during the 18th dynasty. much by Amenophis Ill (who also set up the many statues of Sekhmet around its precincts), though construction "vas continued by rulers of later periods through Ptolemaic tin1es. rviut participated in many of the great festival processions with her husband Amun and \,Vas transported in her ov,rn sacred barge for these occasions. She also exercised independent pov.;er in her o,vn cultic rituals and ceremonies such as the important 'Festival of the Navigation of i\llut' held on the great Isheru lake. Another of her important temple rituals both at her Isheru precinct and in her other sanctuaries was that kno,,vn as the 'overthro,ving of Apep', the inimical serpent who threatened the sun god. In this ritual wax models were made representing the physical enemies of Egypt vvhich ,vere identified by name before being destroyed. i\llut is kno\,vn to have had a temple oracle to which worshippers brought problems. and the 'Great lVIother' \,Vas represented in n1any votive statues and amulets showing a high degree of personal veneration of the goddess.
Nebet-hetepet
A relatively n1inor Heliopo\1tan goddess whose name means 'mistress of the offering' or 'mistress of contentment', Nebet-hetepet was a feminine counterpart of the creator god Atum and her identity was similar to that of the goddess lusaas also venerated at Heliopolis. Both goddesses personified the female principle represented by the hand ,vith ,.vhich Atum ,.vas said to grip his phallus in bringing the "vorld into existence. Nebet-hetepet could be associated ,vith Hathor and was venerated at several sites, but \Vas primarily little more than a logical complement to the masculine deity of creation.
Nehemtawy
A minor goddess kno\vn ma,n,y as the consort of the serpent deity Nehebu-Kau or of Thoth, Nehemtavvy usually appears in anthropomorphic form and was frequently depicted in the shape of a goddess nursing an infant on her lap. In representations of this type she can usually only be distinguished from other nursing goddesses such as lsis and Mut by her headdress which is usually in the form of a sistrum. Little is knovvn of the worship of the goddess other than that she vvas venerated ,.vith Thoth in his cult centres, especially that of liermopolis in i'vliddle Egypt.
Neith
Mythology
Neith is one of the mosl ancient deities kno,vn from Egypt. There is ample evidence that she ,vas one of the most important deities of the prehistoric and Early Dynastic periods and, impressively, her veneration persisted to the very end of the pharaonic age. Her character ,vas complex as her mythology continued to gro\v over this great span of time, and although many early myths of the goddess are undoubtedly lost to us, the picture ,ve are able to



recover is still one of a povverful deity \Vhose roles encon1passed aspects of this life and the beyond.
vVarrior goddess: \~lhile this aspect of her personality ,vas perhaps overstated in son1e older studies of Egypt's deities, it is undeniabJe that Neith was associa ted \1/ith vveaponry - either in a context of hunting or ,varfare or possibly both - from very early times. Her earliest emblems consisted of crossed arro1A1s and bo\vs and she ,vas called 'rr1istres.,s of the bo\•V' and ·ruler of arrov1s'. Early Egyptian theophoric nan1es such as 'Neith fights' and 'Neith is victorious' also underscore this beJlicose aspect of the goddess's character, and from Old Kingdom times Neith could appear as one of the m~nifestations of the fierce 'Eye of Re'. In the R;;lrnessid story knovvn as the ·contendings of Horus and Seth', Neith is a vvise counsellor to whom Re himself appeals for help. though her aggressive nanbre is seen in her threat that she will grow angry and n,ake the sky fall to the earth if her advice is not :ollowed. The ancient Greeks identified Neith with .-\thena, probably primarily because of her vvarlike aspect, though there were other aspects of Neith \,·hich supported this association.
Creator goddess: ln her cosmogonic role Neith \.vas also identified with the v.1aters of Nun which pre~eded crea tion, and with the process of creation ::self. As such she ,vas called 'great C0\:1/1 or the ·great flood', and closely associated with the creator deity Meher-,iVeret. The earliest extant reference to :his role appears on the sarcophagus of the 19thdynasty king Nierenptah vvhere Neith is said to be :he creative force present at the very beginning, yet •he idea 1,,vas doubtless much older. In Ron1an times, ·c-.'\1S inscribed in the te1nple of Khnun1 at Esna rten1pted to claim Neith as an Upper Egyptian deity vvho en1erged fro1n the pri1neval waters to ~--reate the ,vorld before travelling northvvard to _· •und her Delta city of Sais. These same texts claim :hat Neith created both Re and the sun god's archen.my Apophis making her the original de1niurge. :\eith \1/aS also considered to have created mankind. nd in the 'Contendings of Horus and Seth' she is -pecifically called Neith 'the eldest, mother of the gods, v.1ho illuminated the first face'.
'!other goddess: The metaphors of creation and :rth clearly overlap and as 1nother of the gods, . eith is naturally seen as an archetypal mother fig-~- Jn the Nevv Kingdom she 1,,vas regarded as the ~other of humans as well as gods. and a text dating ~om the 6th century BC states that it was she who m"-ented birth. Amenopbis 1J claims that he is one \ \·hose being Neith moulded' and in a sin1ilar rnan~er 1t is Neith, along 1Nith the goddess Serket 1an0ther deity associated with motherhood). who supports the bed in which the queen and the god :\mun en1brace in the theogamies depicted in Hat·
shepsut's ten1ple at Deir el-Bahri and in Luxor Temple. Already by Old Kingdom titnes Neith \:Vas regarded as the mother of the crocodile god Sobek and thus 'the nurse of crocodiles'. Although no male deity ,vas firmly celebrated as the partner of Neith and it is sometimes said that she may have been a neutral, almost sexless deity not unlike the Near Eastern virgin goddess Anat or the Greek Athena, the evidence of Neith as a rnother goddess militates against this view.
Goddess of Loiver Egypt: Neith was certainly the most important goddess and perhaps the most important deity of Lo,;ver Egypt. Although she was sometimes called 'Neith of Libya', this reference may simply refer to the proximity of the Libyan region to the goddess's chief province in the western Delta. Her frequent representations \:vearing the Red Crown of Lovier Egypt indicate that Neith ' came to personify the northern. Delta region or acted as tutelary goddess of the crown of that area. In the Pyran,id Texts her aggressive nature is tied to this role in the statement. ·May the terror of you come into being... like the Net [Neith}cro,hln which is on the King of Lower Egypt' (PT 724). The temple of Neith at Sais vvas sometirnes called the 'house of the bee' and the bee became an important monarchial symbol incorporated into the developed royal titulan1 often associated \:Vith Lo,ver Egypt.
Funerary goddess: Frorn Old Kingdom times (though rarely at first) Neith ,vas associated \.Vith Egyptian funerary beliefs and rituals. In the Pyramid Texts she is said to \Vatch over the deceased Osiris along 1,,vith lsis, Nephthys and Serket (P1' 606). and eventually the four goddesses 1A1ere each assigned one side of the coffin \Vith the responsibility of vvatching over the four canopic guardians knovvn as the sons of Horus. In this role Neith \vas usually placed at the east side of the coffin as the protectress of Duamutef, guardian of the stomach of the deceased. Spells of the Coffin Texts equate the deceased v.rith Neith in the under\vorld and also identify her as one of the judges of the dead (CT Spell 630). In the later 'Book of that \vhich is beyond' Neith aids the king and Re himself in the undervvorld journey. Because Neith 1,,vas also the inventor of \veaving according to Egyptian myth, she vvas naturally associated \1/ith the funerary process as provider of the mummy bandages and shrouds.

depicted in human form. At first, the goddess wears tvvo bows on her head, and she'is not depicted \vearing the Red Cro\:\1n of Lower Egypt, the region with which she was most closely associated, until the 5th dynasty when she appears this way in the temple of Userkaf at Abu Ghurob. Her representations frequently depict Neith carrying only the was (power) sceptre and the ankh (life) symbol, but in her guise as warrior goddess she frequently holds a bow and arrow or a harpoon. Later in history Neith could also be portrayed in zoomorphic form. Herodotus records seeing the image of the goddess as a kneeling cow \.Vith a sun disk betvveen its horns during her festival at Sais. and a bovine form of her image vvas a\so used at Esna. The goddess cou1d also appear in serpentine form as protectress of the king
or of Re, as n1ay be seen in the Book of the Dead (BD 185) and in the gilded wooden cobra found in Tutankhamun's totnb. ln her guise as mother goddess and as the mother of Sobek, Neith is shown in the nursing motif, and a1nulets show the goddess as a ,vornan standing, suckling a small crocodile at each breast, or as a woman \.vith a crocodile's head. At Esna Neith ,vas associated ,:vith the Nile perch which could represent her because, according to

myth, she turned herself into such a fish to swim in the primeval waters.
Worship
Neith's prominence in early dynastic times - as seen in 1st-dynasty labels, funerary stelae, and in the
names of her priestesses and the contemporary queens such as Neithotep and 1\llerneith - suggest the goddes...s \Vas ,:vorshipped from the beginnings of Egyptian culture. fn fact, the earliest portrayal of what is thought to be a sacred shrine in Egypt is associated with Neith. Her symbol stands in the enclosure of a reed-built sanctuary on an ebony label from Abydos which seems to depict a visit made by the 1st-dynasty l{ing Aha to a sanctuary of Neith. Yet widespread depictions of Neith's standard on early pottery indicate the goddess was venerated over a considerable area, and she \.Vas doubtless the rnost important goddess of the Ear1y Dynastic Period. This pre-eminence may have eventually been challenged, however, and the 5th-dynasty I<ing Userkaf is believed to have re-emphasized the cult of Neith after the later rulers of the 4th dynasty had supplanted her \vith Hathor. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence that Neith's

In the Middle Kingdom and early New Kingdorn Neith seems to have lost some of her earlier status, but perhaps as a result of the Ramessid relocation of the capital to the Delta area. Neith regained importance in the 19th dynasty. She \vas credited ,vith superlative povvers in several texts. and in Ramesses II's coronation scene recorded in the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak it is Neith who stands next to the enthroned state god A1nun. In post-Nev.r Kingdom times Neith naturally rose to particular i1nportance in the 26th dynasty ,vhen kings of the great cult centre of Neith - the Delta city Sais (modern Sa el-Hagar) - ruled Egypt. The goddess received revenue fron1 the Greek trading settlement at Naukratis, further enriching her impressive temple, which the Greek historian Herodotus described. Neith ,vas highly venerated in other temples of the Graeco-Roman Period - especially at Esna - \.Vhere she was worshipped with Khnum. and her great festival was celebrated on the thirteenth day of the third month of the 'summer' season each year. The worship of Neith thus spanned virtually all of Egypt's history and she remained to the end 'Neith, the great'.
Nephthys
Mythology
Nephthys was a funerary goddess \vho usually played a subordinate role to her sister Isis. She appears only in the myths of Heliopolis and nothing is known about her before her appearance there. The goddess's Egyptian name. nebet-hut. means 'mistress of the mansion' but gives us no real clue to
her original identity. As the daughter of Geb and Nut, she was one of the four deities at the core of the Osiris myth, characterized as the nominal partner of the god Setb just as Isis was the wife of Osiris. According to one late story Nephthys also had a

sexual liaison ,vith Osiris resulting in the birth of her son Anubis. Her role in the Osiris myths is ahvays supportive of Isis and Osiris and the goddess does not seem to ever take her husband's side in the mythical struggles. \i\lhen Osiris is murdered, Nephthys n1ourns greatly and joins her sister in searching for the god and reassen1bling and guarding him when he is found. In the Pyra1nid Texts the goddess appears alongside Isis n1any times, usually vv1ith assertions that the t\VO sisters assist, protect and support Osiris. Their roles \Vere naturally applied to the king vvho is also said to be ·reassembled' by them as well as being 'conceived' and 'nursed' by the nvo goddesses. along with various other 1netaphors stressing their part in the king's resurrection or afterlife rebirth. Nephthys thus became one of the major deities held to be protectors of the dead and along ,.vith lsis she was one of the four guardian deities of the canopic jars and of other items of the funerary asse1nblage in royal and private burials alike. In the Late Period Nephthys ,vas also linked vvith Anukis, though her primary association remained always with Isis.
Iconography
The usual rnanner of depiction for Nephthys is anthropomorphic as a fe1nale goddess distinguished only by the hieroglyphic syn'lbo\s for her nan1e which she v,,ears on her head. Nephthys may also be represented as a kite, hovvever, especially in the vignettes of funerary texts \vhere the two sisters are sometimes depicted in th is avian forn1 guarding the body of Osiris. In human form Neph• thys ,vas represented at the corners or ends of sarcophagi, coffins and shrines for the protection of their contents and is usually placed at the head end of the deceased 1,,vhile Isis was positioned at the feet - although the tv,10 sisters are occasionally both depicted at the head of the deceased. [n scenes vvhere Osiris is depicted the t.vo goddesses usually
flank the netherv1orld god or his symbol, and when he is shovm enthroned they both stand behind hi1n in a position of protection and support.
Worship
Despite her irnportant position in ancient Egyptian funerary beliefs and her widespread representation, Nephthys appears to have had no te1nples or formal cult of her own. though her association with Isis. Anukis and other deities led to the representation of Nephthys in their sanctuaries. Amulets of the goddess are quitecon1n1on, but even these appear much later than those of other members of the Osirian dra1na. While one or t,vo exa1nples are kno,vn from the 22nd dynasty. no other amulets of the goddess are kno,vn to date before the 26th dynasty. After this time, however, Nephthys a,nulets appear on virtually every Egyptian mummy, usually alongside those of Isis.
Nut
Mythology
The goddess Nut vvas primarily the personification of the vault of the heavens, though her character included many different aspects \Vithin this role. As a member of the great Ennead of Heliopolis she was tb.e daughter of Shu and Tefnu t - the deities of air and moisture vvho \Vere the first offspring of the primeval demiurge Atu1n; and she herself represented the firma1nen t vvhich separated the earth from the encircling \Vaters of chaos our of 1,,vhich the ,vorld had been created. Nut thus fulfilled an important cosmogonic role - she was not only the great sky ,.vhose 'laughter' was the thunder, and



whose 'tears' ,.vere the rain, but she vvas also the 'rnother of the heavenly bodies \.vho were believed to enter her mouth and emerge again fron1 her womb each day. The sun ,:vas thus said to travel through the body of the goddess during the nighr hours and the stars travelled through her during the day. This cosmic imagery was the basis of the assertion that the goddess was 'the fe1nale pig who eats her piglets'. Nut was nevertheless vievved in a positive manner, and the myth of the birth of her children \¥as recorded by Plutarch vvho states that, fearing the usurpation of his ovvn position, the sun god placed a curse on the sky goddess stopping her giving birth on any day of the 360-day year. The god Hermes (Thoth) came to Nut's aid, hov1ever, and v,,on five extra days for the year enabling the goddess to bear her children. Several scholars have suggested that Nut may originally have represented the Milky Way, as Spell 176 of the Book of the Dead refers to this broad band of stars vvhich crosses the night sky and the follo,ving spell begins ,,vith an invocation of Nut, and so1ne representations of the Ramessid Period sho\.v stars around the figure of the goddess as ,..vell as on her body. There is astronomical evidence which may support the equation. Ronald Wells has shown that in the predawn sky at winter solstice in predynastic Egypt the Niilky Way "vould have looked remarkably like a stretched out figure with
a d
r-! 01,
arms and legs touching the horizons in exactly the manner in which the goddess was often later depicted. Furthermore, at the time of the vvinter solstice the sun ,vould have risen in the area of the goddess's figure - her pudendun1 - from which it vvould be imagined to be born, just as nine months earlier, at the spring equinox, thesun \.vould have set in the position of the goddess' head - suggescing it ,vas beingsvvallowed. Nut also became inextricably associated with the concept of resurrection in Egyptian funerary beliefs, and the dead ,vere believed to becon1e stars in the body of the goddess. According to Heliopolitan theology Nut united vvith her brother Geb, the earth god, to produce Osiris and those deities
associated \Vith him in the great mythic cycle of resurrection. ln this vvay the priests of Heliopolis were able to incorporate the important nethenvorld god into their own solar religion and at the same time to strengthen the association of Nut vvith the concept of resurrection and rebirth. Nut is therefore an important deity in the Pyramid Texts, appearing there almost 100 times. She fulfilled a central role in the resurrection of the deceased king both as heavenly co1vv (PT 1344) - and as a funera ry goddess who addresses the king as his 'mother Nut in her name of "sarcophagus'' ...in her na1ne of "Coffin'' and... in her name of "tomb'" (PT 616). In the later Coffin Texts similar ideas are elaborated for the non-royal deceased. Not surprisingly, in later tin1es the roles of Nut and Harbor - also a co\v deity and funerary goddess - vvere sometin1es con:flated. Hathor ,:vas thus sometimes viewed as a sky goddess and Nut sometimes replaces Hathor as the goddess of the divine sycamore tree who nourishes the deceased. although the connection of Nul herself -..vith the coffin may have led to her association with vvood and thus the sycamore tree.

Iconography
In tnost of her representations Nut was depicted in anthropomorphic form (often as a goddess identified by the circular vvater pot which she \Vore on her head, sometimes \Vith the addition of the ceilinglike sky sign, as the hieroglyphic symbol for her name). She is often shown in profile, bending naked over the earth god Geb and s01netimes supported by Shu, the god of the air, with her arms and legs bent down so that she touches the horizons with her hands and feet. Because of the conventions of Egyptian art in which the goddess's arms and legs seem to be held together, in these representations she appears as a narrow bridge across the sky (as would certainly be appropriate if she were equated with the Milky Way), though it is possible that she was imagined to cover the whole vault of heaven with her hands and feet respectively placed at the four cardinal points. On tbe ceiling of the burial chamber of the tomb of Ramesses VI in the Valley of the Kings, the goddess is depicted in two colossal profile images painted back to back separately representing the day and night sky. Nut was also depicted en face on the undersides of the lids of coffins and sarcophagi - frequently showing the solar disk in the process of being s1,vallowed or reborn. In these representations the depiction of the goddess \Vas placed over the deceased so that a kind of union was achieved, and the coffin itself syrnbolically became the body of the goddess from ,vhom the deceased would be reborn. The tomb of Tutankhamun may contain an interesting visual allusion to this idea for the young king is sho\vn there with the goddess Nut directly after the 'opening of the mouth' ceremony and before he goes before the god Osiris, as though his depiction vvith Nut represents the transitional time in the coffin benveen burial and the afterlife.

private tombs of Thebes and in vignettes in the Book of the Dead, Nut is also depicted as a goddess rising from the trunk of the divine sycamore to proffer life-sustaining vvater and nourishrnent in the afterlife. The goddess could also be depicted in zoo1nor
phic form as the sky cow or sky s01,v. In her bovine form her four hooves ,vere the cardinal points, and the sun god and stars are often shov-1n saiIing across the underside of her body. Tn this form the divine sky cow ,vas also often sho\vn supported by the air god Shu who stands with upraised arms beneath her, and by Heh gods (see p. 78) \Vho support her legs ,vhich are the 'pillars of the sky'. Because Nut could also be regarded as a female pig, she \vas also represented in the form of a so\v, sometimes shovvn with her young.
Worship
As with most cosmic deities, Nut had no cult or temples of her O\.vn, though she was depicted in astronomical ceilings and representations in many temples and tombs. Her place in popular religion, while probably very limited, is perhaps nevertheless seen in amulets of the SO\.V, sometimes with her piglets, which appear in burials from the 1'hird Intermediate Period onwards. Some of these amulets may have been worn in life and could stress the goddess's po,ver in the area of fertility or as a deity of rebirth.

Qadesh
Mythology
Qadesh was a Syrian goddess of sacred ecstacy and sexual pleasure. Her Semitic name would seem to mean 'holy' and despite her Near Eastern orgins, the goddess was thoroughly assimilated into Egyptian religion in New Kingdom tin1es to the extent that she \vas worshipped as part of a popular divine triad along with the fertility god i\tlin and the Asiatic god Reshep. Qaclesh was often linked 1,,vith Hathor whom she resembled in some ways and with the inherently sensual Near Eastern goddesses Anat and Astarte, both of whom ,vere kno\\rn in Egypt.
Iconography
In Egyptian representations Qadesh is alrnost invariably depicted as a naked woman - sho\vn frontally- holding lotus blossoms in her right hand and snakes or papyrus stems in her left hand, all of these being syrnbols of eroticisrn and fertility. Her similarities to Hathor meant that the iconography of her hairstyle and headdress so1netimes approxi rnate those of the Egyptian goddess. Frequently Qadesb is depicted standing on the back of a lion
and in some representations she is Ranked by iVIin on her right and Reshep on her left, the tvvo gods usually being depicted standing on plinths or

shrines which elevate them closer to the sarne height as the leonine-borne goddess.
Worship
In the Near East the cu\t of Qadesh involved the sirnulation of a sacred marriage betv..reen the goddess and her consort Reshep by her followers. Ii is not known vvhether similar rites were enacted in Egypt, where the cult of Qadesh \.vas established at least as early as the 18th dynasty, but the goddess seems to have been fairly \.Yidely venerated. Her image is found on a good many 19th-dynasty votive and funerary stelae and she was vvorshipped in temples at lVIemphis and other locations.
Raet
By at least the 5th dynasty a fe1nale counterpart had been assigned to Re, the sun god, and the simple name of the goddess - the feminine form of the name Re - indicates that she was created to complement the sun god rather than having been a deity with an independent prior existence. ln the Pyramid Texts the goddess is called Raet and though a fuller variant of her name vvas Raetta'vvy, 'Raet of the Two Lands', it is uncertain at what point this form ,vas first used. ln later times she was addressed by the expanded titles 'Raet of the Tvvo Lands, the lady of heaven) n1istress of the gods', parallel to the superlative titles of her husband. Nevertheless, the goddess played a lesser role in Egyptian mythology than Hathor \vho was also vie,,ved as the vvife or daughter of Re. Raet is therefore not frequently represented pictorially and is usually depicted in a Hathor-like form as a \VOman ,..vearing a solar disk \¥ith horns and a uraeus. sometimes with the addition of tw·o feathers above the disk. A festival of Raet was held in the fourth month of the harvest season, and she \Vas venerated, along ,.vith i\tlontu and Harpokrates, in the Graeco-Roman temple of Medamud.
Renpet
A minor goddess \vho personified the year, and \Vas recognized by the notched palm branch which \1/as the hieroglyphic sign for 'year' vvhich she vvore on her head. Renpet \vas quite frequently depicted in temple and other scenes but had no important cult.
Satis
Mythology
The Upper Egyptian goddess Satis guarded the southern frontiers of Egypt in historical times and \.Vas also connected \Vith the Nile. Her link with the upper reaches of the Nile perhaps caused her to be



associated \.\Jith the annual inundation and with Elephantine in the area of Asvvan which Egyptian rnythology someti1nes identified as the source of the Nile. Her name is first attested on stone jars found beneath the Step Pyracnid at Saqqara (3rd dynasty), and by the 6th dynasty she is mentioned in the Pyramid Texts as purifying the deceased king ,vith four jars of 'vVater from Elephantine. As ·m:stress of Elephantine' Satis became the consort of Khnum and thus mother of Anukis, though a relatively early connection ,,vith the Theban god \ 1ontu is also known for Satis and the original consort of Khnum appears to have been the goddess Heket. When Khnun1 vvas identified vvith Re, Satis became an 'Eye of Re' and the goddess then someti1nes assumed some of the characteristics of Hathor, the goddess more usually depicted in this mythological role. Satis was identified with the star Sirius, called Sothis, which heralded the Nile inundation each year. The Greeks identified Satis with Hera. the wife of Zeus.
Iconography
Satis is almost ah,vays depicted as a vvoman vvearing the conical White Crown of Upper Egypt to \\·hich are attached antelope horns or plu1nes and a uraeus. Usually she wears a simple sheath dress and may carry an ankh or 1.,vas sceptre as signs of her divinity rather than personal attributes. Early \\Titings of her name use a hieroglyph representing

a shoulder knot in a linen garment, but later writings use an animal skin pierced by an arr0\1/. This latter symbol could have been assimilated from Anukis the hunb·ess goddess \,vho came to be seen as her daughter. The syrnbol is sometimes depicted vvith the goddess in representational \.vorks.

predynastic site. Research by Ronald \Veils has shov,rn that elements of the temple of Satis \.Vere carefully aligned with the position of the star Sothis or Sirius in the night sky, tying the goddess in this manner to the star's rising and the annual inundation of the Nile. It has also been pointed out that the goddess's ternple was situated at a point 1,vhere the \.Vaters of the inundation might be heard before they became visible in the 101.ver reaches of the Nile, so that her function of protector of the borders could also be tied to that of guardian of the Nile's flood and its resultant fertility.

Seshat
Mythology
Seshat (literally, 'the female scribe') was the goddess of all fonns of writing and notation, including record keeping, accounting, and census taking as \.vell as being ·she \vho is foremost in the house of books': the patroness of ternple libraries and other collections of texts. The goddess is known from as early as the 2nd dynasty \.Vhen she is attested assisting King I<hasekhem\vy in the ritual 'stretching the cord' ceremony, as Seshat was also the 'mistress of builders' and it vvas she \Vho established the ground plan on the founding or expansion of every sacred structure. Beginning in the Old I(ingdom Seshat is also found recording herds of different types of anirnals seized as booty, and from the fvliddle Kingdom she records the names of foreign captives in addition to their tribute, and in Ne,v Kingdom temple scenes she records the king's regnal years and jubilees on the leaves of the sacred ished or persea tree. Along with Nephthys, Seshat was said to restore the members of the deceased in the afterlife. The goddess was also associated vvith some few other deities, mainly the god Thoth \vhose sister, consort or daughter she was variously said to be. In New I(ingdom times Seshat \.Vas parallelled by the goddess Sefkhet-abvvy whose characteristics and attributes see1u to be virtually identical to her O\:vn. It is unlikely, therefore, that she is really anything but a form of Seshat.
Iconography
Seshat was depicted in anthropomorphic form as a ,voman often wearing a leopard skin over her robe and vrith a headdress consisting of a headband with a tall extension upon which ,vas an obscure en1blem resembling a rosette or seven-pointed star. This 'star' is often surmounted by a bow or crescent moon-like symbol resembling do\.vnturned horns, which was itself sometimes cro\:vned by two falcon

feathers. Usually the goddess holds a palm rib upon which the years were notched and which may terminate in a tadpole (the hieroglyphic number for 100.000) seated upon the shen (eternity) hieroglyph symbolizing an infinite number of years. In scenes ,-vhere Seshat records the jubilees of the king, hieroglyphic signs for the festival are also suspended fron1 the tip of the branch. When she is depicted alongside the king in the foundation ceremony, Seshat often holds the stake and mallet and stretches taut the line used to mark out the parameters of nevi buildings.
Worship
By her very nature Seshat was a deity of official building, recording and writing projects and she rarely appears outside of these contexts. She appears to have had no temple of her own, but by virtue of her role in the foundation ceremony she ,.vas a part of every temple building. In a similar n1anner she played no real part in popular religion, although she may have been held to be a patron goddess of sorts among scribes and builders.
Sothis
Mythology
~fhe goddess who personified the bright, firs t magnitude star Sirius (the 'dog star') ,vas called Sopdet by the Egyptians and Sothis by the Greeks. Her husband was Sah, god of the neighbouring constellation Orion, and her son Soped or Sopdu, another astral deity. The importance of Sirius for the Egyptians lay in the fact that the star's annua l appearance on the eastern horizon at dawn heralded the approximate beginning of the Nile's annual
inundation ,-vhich marked the beginning of the agricultural year. Thus the goddess was called 'bringer of the New Year and the Nile flood' and became associated at an early date with Osiris ,vho syrnbolized this annual resurgence of the Nile and who was also personified in the night sky by the neighbouring constellation Orion. Even as early as the Pyramid Texts Sothis ,vas described as having united with the king/Osiris to give birth to the morning star, Venus, and through her association \.Vith the netherworld god she was naturally identified 1,vith Isis - eventually appearing at times as the combined goddess Isis-Sothis.
Iconography
Although the earliest kno"vn representation of Sothis - found on a 1st-dynasty ivory tablet of Djer fron1 Abydos - depicts the goddess as a reclining co\.v with a plant-like emblem (perhaps representing the 'year') bet\.veen her horns, she is almost invariably represented as a \.VOman wearing a tall crown not unlike the White Crown of Upper Egypt but ,-vith ta ll, ups\vept horns at the sides and

surn1ounted ,vith a five-pointed star. In this form Sothis had few iconographic attributes and is usually depicted as sin1ply standing with arn1s at her sides or with one arm folded across her lo\ver breast. On occasion the goddess could also be represented as a large dog, ho,.vever, and in her form of Isis-Sothis she is also shown riding side-saddle on this symbolic animal on son1e of the coins minted at Alexandria in Roman times.
Worship
The star Sirius may have been ,,vorshipped as a co,v-goddess in predynastic times, but eventually became identified ,.vith Isis and vvith Sothis. vVhile Sothis vvas clearly a goddess of so1ne importance in her O\vn right, her increasing identification ,:vith Isis led to a lessening of her individual identity in later times. In the Old Kingdon1 she vvas important as a deity of the inundation and as an afterlife guide to the deceased king, yet by the Niiddle Kingdom she is identified as a 'mother' and 'nurse', and during the Graeco-Roman Period her assimilation with Isis \Vas almost complete.
Tasenetnofret
A goddess with only fairly localized importance, Tasenetnofret was honoured at Korn On1bo in Upper Egypt as the consort of Horus and mother of
Panebtawy.Her name means 'the good sister' or 'the beautiful sister' and she appears to be essentially a local 1nanifestation of Hathor.
Tayet
Tayet was the goddess of vveaving known from Old Kingdon1 tin1es vvhen she appears in the Pyramid Texts, ,vhere it is said that she is the king's mother vvho clothes him and lifts him up to the sky (PT 741), and that she g-uards the king's head, gathers together his bones, and grants him favour with other gods (PT 738). In later rnythology Tayet \.Vas also said to
,:11eave the curtains or vvalls of the tent of purification in ,:vhich the embalmers worked, but the most significant role played by this goddess is that she is the deity ,:vbo provided the bandages in \.vh ich the mummy ,vas vvrapped. The importance of these ,vraps to the ancient Egyptians and the proper burial procedure which utilized them is seen in the iVliddle Kingdom story of Sinuhe, vvhere the hero of the tale is urged to return to Egypt by Senvvosret I \vho ren1inds him that only there ,..vill he receive '\,vrappings from the hands of Tayet' upon his death. The goddess was linked to Neith, vvho ,vas also associated with weaving, and with Osiris, Isis and Nephthys because of her funerary role. Although she had no temples of her own, Tayet ,,vas honoured in sanctuaries of several deities with ,vhom she was associated.
Tjenenyet
Tjenenyet isfirst attested by name on carved blocks dated to the 12th dynasty but may have existed prior to that time. She vvas \vorshipped, along with the goddess Iunit, as joint consort of the falcon deity Montu in the town of Armant (Hermonthis) and in the surrounding Theban region. In the Ramessid Period of the Nev, I(ingdom she rose to somewhat greater importance, but declined in later Egyptian history. Although s;ometin1es thought to be the same as the goddess Raet, the association does not seem likely as the tvvo deities are kno\.vn to have been depicted together.

Several Egyptian deities 1,,vere associated with trees: Horus vvith the acacia, Osiris with the willo,;v, Re wi th the sycamore and \i\'epv,rav,ret with the tamarisk, for example; but none of these male gods held associations ,vith trees as closely as did a number of female deities. The sycamore ,vas especially regarded as a manifestation of the goddesses Nut, Isis, and Ha thor - who \Vas given the epithet 'Lady of the Sycamore', and there ,vere also a number of minor

~ee goddesses. These deities were represented in a •;ariety of ways. Images of trees labelled as godde:;ses are known and fully anthropomorphic personifications of tree goddesses are also found, ·hough the rnost usua l depiction consisted of a comJ)()site of the upper body of the goddess rising fron1
the trunk at the centre of a tree. Many such representations show Hathor,Nut, or some other goddess reaching out from a tree to offer the deceased food and vvate.r. Sometimes only the arms of the goddess \vere shown proffering food or water, and in the well-kno\¥n representation in the tomb of Tuthrnosis Ill the king is shovv'n being nursed at the breast of 'his mother Isis' in the form of a sycamore tree. The identification of several maternal deities as tree goddesses also meant that burial in a \.Vooden coffin ,vas viewed as a return into the womb of the mother goddess.
Waset
This goddess, whose name (often written vVosret) means 'the powerful fe1nale one', is associated primarily \Vith the Theban area and was possibly the earliest consort of the god Amun before the rise to po\.ver of Mut. Her nan1e is that of the city of Thebes and she appears in the names of the three i\1iddle Kingdom pharaohs of Theban origin called Senwosret (Sesost.ris) \vhich means 'man of Wosret'. Waser may have originally been a form of the goddess Hathor, but she certainly took on her ovvn identity as time progressed. She was depicted in anthropomorphic form as a goddess holding her symbol, the was 'power' sceptre to which a plume
and ribbons were attached.

BOVINE DEITIES
Egypt's bovine deities were among the most important of all her gods. They represented both male and female deities, some of which existed from the earliest periods of Egyptian history. Generally speaking, female bovine deities represented the powers of creation and fecundity, and a number of mother and sky goddesses \1/ere depicted in bovine form. Male bovine deities could have cosmic associations but generally represented the po\.ver and sexual potency embodied by the bull and were strongly tied to aspects of kingship and monarch ical ideo1ogy.
Apis
Mythology
Apis was the 1nost important of the bull deities of Egypt and can be traced back to the beginning of the Dynastic Period. The origins of the god called by the Egyptians Hap are not entirely clear, but

because his cult centre was at Mernphis he vvas assimilated into the 1,vorship of the great ~.tlen1phite god Ptah at an early date - first as the 'herald' or son of that god. and eventually as the living image or manifestation of the 'glorious soul' of Ptah himself. There \.vas only one bull representing Apis .ar a time and it was chosen after its predecessor's
death by means of its appearance. According to Herodotus, the Apis buH ,vas ahvays black ,-v\th particular mark ings (see Iconography) and with a scarab-li ke hurnp under its tongue and the hair of its tail being divided into t\VO strands. Mythologicall y, it was said that the Apis bull vvas born of a virgin CO\.V that had been impregnated by the god Ptah. and Apis' association \Vith the Niemphite god tended to stress the sacred bull,s procreative pow·er as a concrete expression of the creative po,1/er of Ptah. As chief of the Egyptian bull deities Api::: "vas also closely linked to monarchical ideology ,vhere the physical power of the bull ,vas stressed.
The king's power was equated \Vith that of the god, as v-1hen the pharaoh strode alongside the Apis bu l1 in the perforn1ance of the Sed festival which
aimed at the strengthening and rejuvenation of hi~ po\.vers.



A.fter his death Apis fused with Osiris, becoming the cornposite god Apis-Osiris or Osirapis (and ~ater, in Hellenistic times, the anthropomorphicallydepicted god Serapis). In this context the living _.\p is bull itself vvas sometimes called the ba of Osiris, and the process of assimilation ,-vith other deities also led to the composite Osiris-Apis-AtumHorus. In some funerary texts Apis was said to thresh the grain in the afterlife, but it is usually his po,ver and virility vvhich are tied to the deceased ::-o that in the Pyramid Texts the deceased king claims the surging power of the bull's phallus as ne of the ways in ,,.rhich he is said to be able to rise JPto the heavens (P'T 1313).
Iconography
_.\pis is usually represented as a walking bull which, n post-Ne\.v K.ingdom times, \.vas depicted with a :-Un disk (occasionally a lunar disk) bet\.veen his oorns-often \.vitha uraeus rising from its base. One i rhe rnost important markings of the Apis bull '>'·as a ,,.,hite triangular blaze on its forehead which s often represented in silver on statues of the god.
A.pis also had special wing-like markings on his back called by Herodotus an 'eagle' but representing the ha,vk's or vulture's \.vings. In many .!epictions of the bull a rectangular cloth \.Vith a decrative diamond pattern is also shown on its back. l:1 the la test periods Apis v.1as represented on coffins 1n the form of a sacred bull running \.Vith the rrn.m1my of the deceased as it ,-vas taken to the tornb. ,..\roulets of Apis in the form of a standing bull are rare, but votive bronzes of the bull, decorated with
its distinctive markings, are quite common from the Late Period. Representations of Apis as a bullheaded man are knov1n but are also rare, and there is an unusual class of scarab amu lets with the head of a bull on the body of the beetle - probably relating it to the funerary aspect of Apis.
Worship
The 5th-dynasty Palermo Stone indicates that Apis v.1as worshipped as early as the reign of Den in the 1st dynasty. The god is knovvn to have been especially venerated at the site of rvie111pbis throughout n1ost of Egyptian history, and according to the

3rd-century vvriter Aelian, the god's cult was established in that location by 1\!Ienes and continued until Roman times which clearly reflects a tradition of great antiquity for the i\!Iemphite cult of Apis. According to the Pyra1nid Texts and the Book of the Dead, the divine bull ,vas also worshipped at Sais and Athribis in the Delta. In Nlemphis the Apis bull was kept in special quarters just south of the temple of Ptah \vhere it was adored by worshippers and entertained by its own harem of co,vs. In addition to its participation in special processions and other religious rituals, the animal was utilized in the delivery of oracles and ,vas regarded as one of the rnost important oracular sources in Egypt. According to the Classical ,vriters Herodotus and Plutarch, \vhen the Apis bull reached its 25th year it was killed with great cerernony. It ,:vas then embalmed and buried in a great granite sarcophagus - some weighing as n1uch as 70 tons - in the vast subterranean galleries of the Serapeun1 at Saqqara. The funeral ceremonies ,vere extensive and it \Vas said that in the Late Period, at the height of its worship, Egypt mourned for the deceased Apis as for the death of the pharaoh himself. The cow ,vhich had produced the Apis bull, knovvn as the Isis cow, \.vas also taken to 1\llemphis at the time of the bull calf's selection and also kept under special circumstances to be eventually buried in the 'Iseurn' not far from the Serapeurn,
Bat
Mythology
Bat \vas an early cow goddess \¥"hose name rneans 'female spirit' or 'female po,ver' and who appears to have been an i1nportant deity of the late predynastic and early historical times. It is difficult to pinpoint Bat's emergence in Egypt and it has been suggested, in fact, that she may have been imported from Nlesopotamia. If, as seems likely, she is the goddess depicted on several predynastic objects (including the Narmer Palette), then her nature ,.vas almost certainly that of a celestial cow goddess. In any event, there are relatively fe'vv mythological references to her, and the earliest written evidence for the goddess is found in tbe Pyramid Texts \-vhich mention 'Bat with her t\.vo faces' - alluding to the double image of the goddess as seen in representations of her on sistra (see Hathor) and else'vvhere. It has been pointed out that the mythology ,.vhich developed around Bat may somehov.1 have stressed the unity· of Egypt, as her image is represented at the centre of a 12th-dynasty pectoral flanked by the reconciled Horus and Seth.
Iconography
Bat is seldom depicted in Egyptian art, though her iconography \Vas distinctive and \¥as an important
influence on the cult of Hathor. The goddess is depicted having a human head with bovine ears and horns - ,vhich grow from her temples rather than fron1 the top of her head, and ,vhich curve inv.,ards (rather than outwards as do Hathor's) giving the head a lyre-like appearance. Her head is often shov.1n atop a pole or a 'body' resembling either a necklace counterpoise or a type of garment knot, so that the total image is suggestive of a sistrun1 or sacred rattle (see Hathor}.
If Bat is the deity depicted at the top of the Narmer PaJette, and also on the king's belt on that n1onument,she may also be the deity represented on an even earlier palette depicting a bovine head with outstanding ears taking the form of stars 'vVith stars attached to the tips of the horns and at the top of the head. This celestial-related iconography ,vou\d also apply to the heads on the Narmer Palette \.vhich appear to look down on the depicted scenes from above. In the f\,1iddle Kingdom the iconography of Bat
vvas almost con1pletely absorbed into that of Hathor, yet her particular image survives on many Hathoric col11111ns.
Worship
Whatever the situation regarding this goddess·s early history, as the chief deity of the 7th Upper Egyptian no1ne (the area around modern Nag Hammadi, "vhere her cult centre was kno,vn as 'the mansion of the sistrwn') Bat ,vas an important local goddeS'2,S for many hundreds of years. Eventually, however, in lVIiddle Kingdom times, she ,:vas subsumed by Hathor, the greater goddess of the adjacent 6th nome of Upper Egypt, ,vho took on her identity and attri butes as an aspect of herself.
Buchis
Mythology
The sacred bull known to the Greeks as Buchis (in Egyptian bakh, ba-akh or bakhu),.vas worshipped in the area of Armant, the ancient Hermonthis, and else\1/here in the region of Thebes. The burial
ground of these bulls, knovvn as the Bucheion, lies

The burial place of the cows b.o were the successive Buchis bull's mothers, _!10,vn locally as the Baqariyyah, is also known at \rn1ant. The legends of the Buchis bu lJ vvere also :ig fasting, and as late as c. t-\D 400 the Roman Titer Macrobius described the sacred animal \vith ·anciful embellishn1ents including the assertions hat the bull changed colour every hour and had a ~-oat of hair which grew backwards.
lcaniography
.\lthough, according to one ancient author. the 3ucnis was an animal with a \1/hite hide and black .ice. it see1ns the bull could be of other colouring Perhaps the basis of the statement by Macrobius oove), and it is not always easily distinguished rn other sacred bulls. Amuletic images are partic.arly difficult to identify, but depictions of the bull d are kno,,vn on stelae and from various other conxt-s from the 19th dynasty on.
.'Jors hip
Jchis was associated with Re and Osiris and par.:ularly v1ith the Theban god Montu with whom he a3 identified directly. As a result, although never -. important as the Apis bull of i\!lemphis or the ::1evis bull of Heliopolis, Buchis 1,vas highly ·ered in the Theban region and was worshipped : only at Armant but also at Thebes itself, and at ~ outlying sites of Tod and 1\!Iedamud. lt is unlikethata separate bull was maintained at allof these '---ations and more probable that a single sacred ""!rnal travelled from site to site and 1,vas representby a statue during times of its absence from any -e sanctuary. As \1/aS the case vvith other sacred
.:~s.,Blllchis delivered oracles at his cult sites but ~ also famous for curing diseases, especially ::;e of the eye. The Buchis bull \1/aS also \\·ned for its ferocity, vvhich rnay have been a
result of its association \vith the warlike Montu, and inscriptions at Medamud show that the animal participated in fights \:Vith other bulls which ,:vere staged in a special arena.
Hesat
Hesat was a co,v goddess ,vith a number o{ mythological associations. Her name may 1nean 'the \vile! one'- and as the wild cow she may have been worshipped fron1 very early times. Already in the Pyramid Texts she appears as the rnother of Anubis (PT 2080 ) and of the deceased king (PT 1029) who is characterized as her son in the form of a golden calf. She was also the divine nurse of the living king, The goddess was said to suckle a number of divine bulls and in particular was the mythical mother of the sacred Nlnevis bull, and in

Mehet-Weret
Mythology
An ancient covv goddess whose name means 'Great Flood', Mehet-\-Veret ,vas said to have risen fron1the waters of creation and to have given birth to the sun god Re \vhorn she placed, as a solar disk, between her horns. This image of the covv ,vho raises the sun disk into the sky also equates Mehet-vVeret with the heavens and she is clearly viewed as a sky goddess in the Pyramid Texts, ,vhere the goddess represents the watef\vay of the sky \vhich vvas sailed upon by the sun god and the king (PT 1131). The goddess of the great flood was closely associated ,-vith Neith and often identified with her. In later times she vvas a!so associated with Hathor as 1,,\/e see in the Book of the Dead (Spell 186), where both are referred to as the 'Eye of Re' (seep. 206). She could also be linked with Isis.

Iconography
This goddess \vas ahnost invariably represented in bovine forn1. 1n the vignettes of the Nevv Kingdom funerary papyri and in tomb paintings she is depicted as a sacred cow with the sun disk behveen her horns, kneeling on a reed mat and often vvearing a ceremonial collar and decorated blanket and v,1ith a sceptre or flail rising from her back as a sign of her povver and divinity. She is almost certainly the deity identified as Isis-Mehet (v.iith :Nlehet probably being an abbreviation of lVIehet-vVeret) portrayed in the giant funerary couch of Tutankhamun made in the forn1 of two slender cows each with a sun disk between its horns.
Worship
As a conceptualization of primeval creation IVIehetvVeret appears to have had no independent cult of her own, though her importance as a power in the area of creation-birth-rebirth meant that she was commonly incorporated into funerary literature and representations.
Mnevis
Mythology
The divine bull of Heliopolis which \Vas kno\.vn to the Egyptians as Mer-\rVer (though the oldest forn1 of the name as it appears in the Coffin Texts is Netn• vVer) and called by the Greeks lVInevis \Vas originally an independent deity \vho vvas incorporated into the \Vorship of the sun god at an unknovvn early date. f\/Ianetho claimed that the god's cult was introduced in the 2nd dynasty, but he appears in only a minor capacity as the 'bull of Heliopolis' in the Pyramid Texts. Yet at some point !Vlnevis came to be regarded as the ba or 'power' of Re and a manifestation of the con1bined Re-Atum and as such gained considerable importance. According to Plutarch the Mnevis bull ,vas second only to the Apis bull of Memphis and was also accorded great respect and privileges. He provided oracles in the same manner as the 111ore famou~ Apis, being regarded as the 'herald' \vho mad1.. known the sun god's wishes and decisions. Like the Apis bull, .f\1nevis is also 1nentioned on the Rosetta Stone as one of the recipients of Ptolemy V's largesse. In a clear effort to enhance the stature of Mnev-is. the priests of Heliopolis claimed Mnevis to be the father of Apis. Although there are some kno\vn links bet-vveen i\.1nevis and Osiris-as i.n dual name~ such as f\/Inevis-Osiris and Mnevis-vVennefer these may be simply the result of an abstract fusion of the solar and nethervvorld deities rather than being based on any direct mythologicalassociation.
Iconography
As with the other sacred bulls of Egypt, there vvas onlyone l\linevis bull at any one tin1e and the animal



selected for the honour was usually one vvith a completely black coat without any markings vvhatsoever. For this reason, in his representations \/Inevis wears a solar disk and uraeus bet\veen his horns which are usually his only attributes.
Worship
As well as being provided ,vith his ovvn bovine harem (consisting principally of t,vo wives representing the cow goddesses Hathor and lusaas), :Vlnevis \vas honoured ,:vith burial in a special cemetery. Because of his close association with the sun god, the Mnevis bull ,vas one of the fevv deities apparently tolerated by Akhenaten \.vho decreed that a cemetery for the divine animal \vas to be made in his capital of Akhetaten (the modern el_-\n1arna), though the site of such a burial has not been found. In later times the burial ground of the sacred Mnevis bulls is kno,vn to have been located ro the northeast of the sun god's main temple at Heliopolis, and great ceremony accompanied the
•
animals' intern1ent- there. A separate burial ground was also maintained for the rnothers of the Ninevis bulls ,,vho \¥ere identified with the co,:v goddess Hesat. Mnevis ,vas also honoured in other areas and appears, for example, in the Graeco-Ro1nan temples of Dendera and Edfu. At the site of Soknopaiu Nesos in the Fayum there was a temple of SerapisOsoromnevis, effectively combining the veneration of Osiris vvith Apis and Mnevis.
Shentayet
The name of this goddess means \vidow' but her origins are obscure. She \Vas depicted as a co\.v or cow-headed wo1nan but eventually assimilated to the goddess Isis under the name lsis-Shentayet. In this late form Shentayet ,vas associated with the resurrection of Osiris and identified w·ith the sarcophagus of the god.
Sky Bull (Bull of the West)
Found in vignettes of Chapter 148 of the Book of the Dead the Sky Bull vvas a mythical creahlre or deity associated vvith the heavens and ,vith the afterlife and thus also called the 'Bull of the \¥est'. The bull \vas said to be the husband of seven cows (seep. 77) \vhich usually accompany him.

FEL IN E DEITIES
A number of the fel ine deities found in the Egyptian pantheon vvere of great importance and no gods were more widely feared and respected. Although the majority vvere leon1ne in form, a great deal of variation occurs in the way these deities existed as lions or cats - and sometimes in both forms at different times or even in the same period. Egypt's feline deities could also be strongly malignant or benign, and many were associated in one way or another with the supreme povver of the sun.
Aker
Mythology
The earth god Aker was an ancient deity kno\vn in both singular (aker) and plural (akeru) aspects. 1n their plural form the Akeru were primeval earth deities of uncertain mythological origin. In the Pyramid Texts they are not described, but they appear in several apotropaic passages in which they are said to tremble before the king or to refrain from laying hold of him (PT 393, 658, 2202). On the other hand, the singular earth god Aker ,:vas said to open the gate of the earth to allow the king to pass into the under,vorld, and to protect the king by grasping or restraining the various serpent demons \Vhich threaten him (PT 504, 676). In later texts such as the Book of Aker or Book of the Earth which ,:vas inscribed in the tomb of Ramesses V1 in the \1alley of the Kings, and the mythological papyri of the 21st dynasty - Aker was also said to imprison the coils of the great serpent Apophis \¥hen it ,vas cut into pieces.
Iconography
In the earliest certain representations of Aker (and occasionally later), the god is si1nply represented as a strip of land with anthropomorphic heads at each end representing the entrance and exit of the underworld. Later the god is portrayed as the foreparts of tvvo lions or sphinxes - representing the two horizons - joined back to back, and this is his most
common iconography. The representation of the god thus resembles a kind of bowl or socket, and Aker was, in fact, associated ,1,1ith the socket vvhich held the mast on the deck of the solar barque. In his double lion or sphinx form the god Aker appears along with other protective deities on .l\.1iddle l<ingdom apotropaic \vands' ,vhere he is often shown holding knives as a symbol of his role as protector of the entrance to the underworld. In the vignettes of later funerary papyri the sun god is shown travelling over the back of the Aker image and Aker is depicted on either side of the underworld cave in \.Vhich the 'flesh' of Sokar is contained.
Worship
Although the god Aker may possibly reach back into the Early Dynastic Period and is certainly vie'vved as a potent force by the time of the Pyra1nid Texts, he rernained a cosmic-geographic type god for whom there was no independent cult. There is s01ne evidence for his inclusion in popular religion. however. Aker may be intended in some of the instances in \.Vhich the double-lion image was uti lized as an amulet of protection or rene,,val; he certainly appears on the apotropaic viands discussed above; and the god was apparently believed to neutralize poisons in the body of anyone who \Vas bitten by a snake or other venomous creature, or \.vho had S\.vallo,ved something harmful or repul s ive.
Apedamak
Mythology
An apparently indigenous lion deity of the Nleroitic civilization to the south of Egypt, Apedamak is thought to have been a deity 'vvhose origins ,vere independent of Egyptian religious thought, yet 'vvhose 'vvorship was incorporated into the Egyptian-influenced temples of the Sudanese region, and even some of the Egyptian-built temples of Nubia. In character, Apedamak was a god of war - a fact which integrated mythologica1ly with the Egyptian concept of a killer lion deity of thesouthern regions - though in Egypt this vengeful lion was always vie,ved as a female deity (see Tefnut). Although Apedamak's independent nature and worship were clearly maintained without absorption into any purely Egyptian cult, the god is depicted alongside Egyptian deities such as f\mun and Hathor in the 'lion temple' at Naqa, and he headed a unique triad which incorporated Isis and Horus as his divine consort and child.
Iconography
Apedamak was usually represented in the form of an anthropomorphic-bodied deity v1ith the head of a lion, or even as a three-headed 1ion, though there

are cases where fully zoomorphic depictions of lions, and even serpent-lions, represent the god. ,:-\!though he is s01netimes said to have been depicted "1.-Vith the head of an elephant, there are no certain representations of the god in this form. In his semi-anthropomorphic depictions he may be shown holding a distinctive sceptre surmounted by a crouching lion, and most images of Apedamak depict him wearing the triple crown.
Worship
The main cult centres associated with Apedamak \Vere at Musav..rwarat el-Sufra and Naqa, both of ,vhich are located in the desert east of the sixth cataract of the Nile in the Sudan. The vast temple complex at MusaW\varat included the largest known temple of Apedamak which seems to have functioned from about 300 BC for over 750 years. fnterestingly, and inexplicably, the inscriptions dedicated to the god in this temple \.Vere written in Egyptian hieroglyphs rather than in the fvieroitic script. There were also 'lion temples' at Meroe and probably other sites in that region, though there is less evidence of Apedamak in northern Nubia; and )t seems that the god was primari\y worshipped as a tutelary deity of the n1ore southerly area.
Bastet
Mythology
Originally a lioness deity, in the course of tirne Bastet beca1ne a cat or cat-headed goddess of milder nature, though both aspects of her personality seem to have then existed concw-rently. In the Pyramid Texts where she appears in her dangerous torm, Bastet aIready also appears as a milcl-natured mother and nurse of the king (PT 1111); and in the

Coffin Texts she provides protection for the deceased, though her aggressive aspect is still seen. As \.vith other lioness deities, Bastet V11as regarded as the daughter of the sun god and could be identified with the 'Eye of Re', but \.Vas also associated with the moon as the 'Eye of the moon'. Even \vhen
she was represented as a cat goddess she still retained her association ,.vith Re and became 'the cat of Re' who destroyed the sun god's serpent enemy, Apophis. Nevertheless, Bastet's developed nature was definitely not as aggressive as that of Sekhmet and although her own son Ma hes reveals the savage leonine aspects of her origins, in later times the goddess is frequently found as a syn1bol of motherhood \\1ho 1,,vas believed to protect women during pregnancy. The Greeks equated Bastet with their o,.vn goddess Artemis.
Iconography
In her earliest known form, as depicted on stone vessels of the 2nd dynasty, Bastet was represented as a \.Voman ,vith the maneless head of a lioness. The iconography of the goddess changed, however, perhaps as her nature began to be vievred as milder than that of other lioness deities. She vvas associated \Vith the cat from T\1iddle Kingdon1 times, and after the close of the New Kingdom she \:Vas usually depicted as a cat-headed woman. In this form Bastet is often portrayed holding the rattle-like sistrun1,
associated with Hathor, and sistra were thus some
times decorated with the images of cats. In a similar manner, tbe goddess \vas also associated with the ritual menat necklace. Late Period amulets depicting lioness deities, v1hile usually uninscribed, seem to often depict Bastet, especially those in which the goddess is shovm holding a sistrurn, n1.enat, papyrus sceptre, or ivedjat eye symbol. Often, especially in bronze statues of the goddess, she is sho,vn \vith a small group of kittens at her feet. In her fully feline form as the cat of Re she was often depicted decapitating the Apophis serpent with a sharp knife.
Worship
Bastet seems to have been an important goddess in fairly early times. The valley ternple of Khafre at Giza records on its fa<;ade the names of only t,vo goddesses: Hathor, representing southern Egypt, and Bastet, representing the north. The goddess's popularity gre\.v over time and in the Late Period and Graeco-Roman times she enjoyed great status. The main cult centre of this deity \vas the city of Bubastis - Tell Basta - in the eastern Delta, and although only the outlines of the temple of Bastet no1,,v remain, Herodotus visited the site in the 5th century BC and praised it for its magnificence. The festival of Bastet \;i,,as also described by Herodotus who claimed it ,.vas the most elaborate of all the religious festivals of Egypt with large crowds participating in unrestrained dancing, drinking and
revelry. Cemeteries of cats mummified and buried
in honour of Bastet have been found at Bubastis and at other sites such as Saqqara where Bastet held a tutelary position. Bastet vvas also venerated in southern Egypt where she \Vas equated with Mut, the consort of Amun at Thebes. A1nulets of cats and litters of kittens were popular Ne\.v Year gifts, and the name of Bastet was often inscribed on small ceremonial 'New Year flasks', probably to evoke the goddess as a bestower of fertility and because Bastet, like other lioness goddesses, was vievved as a protective deity able to counter the darker forces associated ,vith the 'Demon Days' at the end of the Egyptian year.

Mahes
Mythology
Although the \.Vord mahes is found in the Pyramid Texts in the sense of 'lion', it is not until the Niiddle I<ingdom that theophoric names utilizing the term Nlahes as the name of a god appear, and it is in the Ne1,,v Kingdom that references to the god first
become comrnon. He 1⁄41as said to be the son of
Bastet or sometimes of Sekhmet and was called Nliysis by the Greeks as well as ~/lios or Mihos. Although locally important, he vvas not particularly featured in Egyptian mythology, though he vvas said to aid the sun god in the fight against the serpent Apophis. Because of his nature Niahes was also viewed as a war god and a guardian of sacred places, and a late Greek text describes him as a god of \Vinds, darkness and storm. He ,.vas associated and identified with several deities including Horus, Nefertem and the sun god himself.
Iconography
Nlahes \:Vas depicted zoomorphically as a lion and a)so as a lion-headed man wearing a short kilt and various headdresses. Among these he may ,vear the sun disk and uraeus, the Atef Crown, or the floral headdress of Nefertem. As a lion man he is frequently sho,~ holding a knife in his paws \¥ith a clump of lotus flowers - reminiscent of his connection with Nefertem - behind him.
Worship
The main cult centre of Mahes vvas the ancient Taremu (modern Tell el-l\1uqdam) ,:vhich the Greeks called Leontopolis- 'lion city' - in the eastern Delta. Although the site is not well preserved and the temple ruins have not been conclusively dated, it appears that there was already a te1nple at Taremu in the 18th dynasty; but evidence of worship of the



god is primarily from later times. In the 23rd dynasty Osorkon III erected an important temple to him in the northern part of the main Bastet sanctuary at Bubastis, his mother Bastet's sacred town, and he \Vas also worshipped in the tO\Vn of Aphroditopolis in Upper Egypt. From these cult centres the god's ,vorship spread southwards, and he is well represented in the Graeco-Ron1an temples of Upper Egypt as at Dendera, Edfu and Philae, and in Nubia \vhere he appears at sites such as Dabod and Dendur. Worship of Mahes is also attested in the outlying oases of Bahariya and Siwa. In the practice of magic and popular rehgion Nlahes is n1entioned in amuletic papyri of the late Ne\v Kingdom, and in the Late Period he \-Vas frequently depicted in small amulets of glazed composition and sometin1es of bronze.

Menhyt
A lesser-known lioness goddess, lVIenhyt \vas worshipped in the area of Edfu in Upper Egypt and also in the Delta region where she vJas associated with the goddess Neith at Sais and also with \iVadjet, the tutelary deity of Lo,ver Egypt with ,vhon1 she is linked in the Coffin Texts. iVlenhyt could function as the uraeus on the bro,\: of the sun god so that, as 1,,vith many leonine deities, she was also regarded as a solar figure.
Mestjet
A lion-headed deity known from only a single inscription, 1\/lestjet was one of the many forms of the fierce 'Eye of Re' and as such provides a clear example of the multiple manifestations of certain deities. The stela on vvhich the goddess's name occurs dates to the 21st dynasty and \.Yas found at Abydos, indicating that Mestjet was a specific forn1 of the 'Eye' \-vorshipped in that particular region.

Pakhet
Mythology
A fierce lioness goddess ,vhose name means 'she vvho scratches' or 'tearer', Pakhet is known from Middle Kingdom times when she is described as a night huntress with sharp claws in the Coffin Texts. Pakhet was believed to instill terror in her enetnies and must be grouped \.Vith the other leonine deities whose nature was, likeSekhmet, prin1arily aggressive. She was called the 'goddess at the enb·ance of the wadi', probably referring to the lion's habit of frequenting v,,ratering areas at the edge of the desert. The goddess ,ivas associated with a form of Horus as her partner, and identified with certain other goddesses such as Weret-Hekau, Sekhmet and Jsis. Pakhet the huntress 1.,vas naturally identified by the Greeks with their O\.vn goddess of hunting, Artemis.
\conography
Pakhet v,,ras not widely depicted in Egyptian art, but sbe most usually appears in combined anthropomorphic-zoomorphic form as a lionessheaded woman. She has no special iconographic attributes, but amulets depicting a lioness goddess standing over the prostrate figures of captives usually appear to represent Pakhet.
Worship
The ,vorship of Pakhet vvas some\.vhat localized and her chief rea)m of influence was the area near Beni Hasan in l\1iddle Egypt. A rock-cut chapel to the goddess carved out of the limestone cliffs by Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III at that location is known by the Greek name Speos Artemidos (the cave of Artemis) due to Pakhet's association vvith that Greek goddess. A whole cemetery of sacred cats ,¥as dedicated to Pakhet in this area, though most of the burials appear to date to the Late Period. There is no surviving evidence for a cult for the goddess at Beni Hasan before early Nev., K.ingdom times, though it is probable that Hatshepsut honoured an established local deity and a formal cult of the goddess certainly seems to date to as far back as Middle Kingdom ti1nes. Amulets of the goddesses were worn in life, probably both for protection and fecundity.
Ruty
Mythology
The twin divine lion gods known as Ruty (Egyptian ru.ty, 'the pair of lions') were linked from early
tirnes with the Heliopolitan deities Shu and Tefnut (PT 447), but because lions typically inhabited the desert margins to the east and .....,rest of the Nile Valley, the animals came to be associated with the eastern and western horizons. The general identification of leonine deities vvith the sun god strengthened this association, and in the 17th chapter of the Book of the Dead Ruty thus became the double lion over whose back the sun rose each day. The twin lions were associated with a number of deities, however. In the Pyramid Texts they tnay be equated with Atum (PT 2081) and in the Coffin Texts we find associations \.Vith Geb, Nut, Re and
other gods (CT I, 8; II, 204; II, 175; etc.).In the Book of the Dead they are equated collectively ,.vith Atum and also, individually, ,.vith Re and Osiris.
Iconography
Although Ruty could be depicted as a single lion or \ion-headed god, the twin deity \Vas most frequent)y sho1.,vn as two lions, often positioned back to back and with the sun disk or horizon hieroglyph (akhet) depicted between them. Because the two animals respectively faced the sunset and sunrise they could thus replace the mountains on either side of the horizon hieroglyph in some representations. The well-knovvn ivory headrest found in the tomb of

Worship
The original cult centre of Ruty was perhaps \ ay-ta-hut, the Greek Leontopolis (modern Tell elYahudiya) in the Delta, but in the Old Kingdom the '.ion pair \vas also aligned ,vith Heliopolis and n1ay ha·1e been venerated at a number of other sites. ..:\\though an essentially cosmic deity, Ruty also c:ntered popular religion. In amuletic form the t\vo :io:is linked the wearer \.vith the daily regeneration
)f the sun and thus had significance in both everyday life and in funerary contexts.
Sekhmet
M'ythology
Sekhmet was the most in1portant of Egypt's leonine deities. As with many Egyptian goddesses, she had "'\,·o distinct aspects to her personality - on the one ."!and a dangerous and destructive aspect, and on ~he other a protective and healing aspect. Her name means 'powetiul' or 'the female powetiul one' and ·yell suits the nature of the goddess as expressed in destructiveness, though it had equal implications :Jr her other aspects. From early tin1es Sekhmet \·as regarded as the daughter of Re and she became
one of the most important n1anifestations of the 'Eye' of the sun god. In the version of the 'Eye· myth applying to Sekhmet (and also to Hathor), v-,hen Re became old and his human subjects began to plot against him he sent the fearsome goddess to punish them - leading to the near destruction of all humanity. Because Sekhmet was said to breathe fire against her enemies she \.vas adopted by rnany Egyptian kings as a military patroness and symbol of their own po\ver in battle, and bore martial titles such as 'smiter of the Nubians'. Even the hot desert \Vinds were said to be the 'breath of Sekhmet'. The leonine goddess was also directly associated \.vith plagues (often called the 'messengers' or 'slaughterers of Sekhmet'), and this too could be tied to the king's po\ver. A passage in the Nliddle Kingdom story of Sinuhe states that the fear of the king overran foreign lands like Sekhrnet in a time of pestilence. On the other hand, Sekhmet's po,ver ,vas used to protect the king in an almost n1otherly manner. and as early as the Pyramid Texts it is stated that the goddess conceived the king (PT 262, 2206). The goddess also had power to ward off pestilence and she could function as a healing deity, even being called 'Sekhmet, mistress of life'. Sekhmet was associated with a number of other deities. She was regarded as the consort of Ptah and mother of Nefertem at Memphis where she eventually absorbed a number of other, 1nore minor deities as 'mistress of Ankhta\vy'. Sekhmet was often closely associated with Hathor - especially as the Eye of Re - and was also linked \Vith the Theban goddess

fvlut, becoming in effect an aggressive manifestation or counterpart of that goddess, as \Veil as being linked with Pakhet, the lioness goddess of i\liiddle Egypt, and the cat goddess Bastet, among others.
Iconography
Sekhmet was 1nost frequently depicted in semianthropomorphic form as a lioness-headed ,voman. She often wears a long wig and usually has a solar disk balanced atop her head in this aspect. The long dress worn by the goddess is often coloured red, and one of Sekhmet's epithets was 'mistress of red linen' symbolizing either her native Lo1,ver Egypt or her warlike nature. Sometimes her garment has a rosette pattern over each nipple and while this has been suggested to reflect patterns in the shoulder hair of lions it is perhaps more likely that the pattern reflects an astronomical symbolis1n of the 'shoulder star' of the constellation Leo \1/hich is marked in Egyptian astronomical paintings. During the reign of Amenophis III, hundreds of statues of Sekhmet were set up in the area of the temple of rviut to the south of the Great Temple of Amun at Karnak, and in the king's mortuary temple in western Thebes. These impressive statues, 1,vhich were carved from hard black granite or diorite, often sho1,v the goddess either seated or standing ,vith a papyrus sceptre - the symbol of her native Lo\ver Egypt. Depictions of lion-headed goddesses vvearing the Double Crown usually represent the fusion of Sekhmet and iVIut. Sekhmet could also be depicted in fully zoomorphic form as a lioness, though this is relatively uncommon. The leonine head of the goddess (or that of certain other feline deities) was also represented on many examples of the so-called aegis - a metal collar surmounted by the head of a deity - ,vhich was used from Ne,v
Kingdom times in cultic ceremonies for the propitiation of the divine.
Worship
Although the main cult centre of Sekhmet was at l\ilemphis, the goddess had temples in many other areas. l\ sanctuary ,vas built in her honour at Abusir (\vhere she appeared in reliefs as early as the 5th dynasty), and she is represented in numerous temples up through the Graeco-Roman Period. Her association ,vith other deities led to further cult centres, and there \vas a specific temple to the combined Sek.hn1et-Hathor, for example, at Korn elHisn in the ,vestern Delta. The priests of Sekhmet are knovvn to )1ave been organized for the cultic service of the goddess from Old Kingdom times and also appear to have played an important role in the magical aspect of medicine in later times, reciting prayers and spells over the sick along with the physical ministrations of the physicians. The formal rite of 'appeasing Sekhmet' was also performed by her priests to combat epidemics. In popular religion, the 'seven arro\.vs of Sekhmet' which were believed to bring bad fortune vvere particularly feared, and many spells and charms vvere utilized for protection against the \vrath of the goddess and her messengers. A spell called 'The book of the last day of the year' was recited over a piece of cloth \1/hich was worn around the neck at the potentially dangerous time of year's end, and on Ne\.v Year's Day itself many Egyptians exchanged presents often in the form of amulets of Sekhmet or Bastet in order to pacify these goddesses. Statues of the goddess can still inspire feelings of a\.ve or apprehension, and the famous statue of Sekhmet which no\v stands in the temple of Ptah at I(arnak \Vas broken early in the 20th century by local people who feared that it might harn1 their children.



Seret
The leonine goddess Seret is only meagrely attested.but a 5th-dynasty inscription shows that she had a presence in the 3rd Lower Egyptian nome. This area was inhabited by a predominantly Libyan population in early times, and it is possible that :_he goddess was of Libyan origin. Seret is someiin1es called a 'goose goddess', but this is an error based on a misunderstanding of the ,vriting of her '.'"!aine.
Shesmetet
The leonine goddess Shesmetet is generally believed to be a form of Sekh1net or Bastet but she may have originated as an independent deity, and it
,
:s possible that her epithet 'lady of Punt' reflects an )rtgin in this African area to the south of Egypt. She.smetet is attested in Egypt from the Early Dynastic Period, however, and is found in the
Prramid Texts (PT 262, 2206) where she is said to give birth to the king. In later funerary texts she also acts as the mother of the deceased. Shesmetet \\·as associated \1/ith, or considered a personification of, the shesmet girdle - a belt ,vith an apron of beads which ,:vas part of the attire of kings of the Early Dynastic Period and Old Kingdom and also 1,\·orn by certain deities such as the god Sopdu. The goddess \Vas depicted in leonine form or as a \Voman ,vith the head of a lion, and her potential ferocity meant that she \Vas invoked as a protective deity in popular religion and in magical spells.
Tefnut
Mythology
A.ccording to the Heliopolitan theology Tefnut was rhe daughter of Atum and the sister-,vife of Shu, but she is a somewhat enigmatic deity. Her role in rhe cosmic scheme is usuall y said to be that of goddess of moisture and Tefnut cert.ainly is associated \\·1th moisture in certain v1ays - she created 'pure ·.vater' for the deceased king from her vagina, for example (PT 2065), but her central identity may lie dse\11here. The goddess's name has no certain ety1nology, though it has been suggested to be an )nomatopoeic representation of the sound of spit~ing as this is mythologically one of the \•vays in \,·hich the divine pair Shu and Tefnut \Vere said to be created by Atum, and her name was represented :>y a pair of lips, spitting, in late texts. But the earliest evidence for Tefnut's original nature is found in :he Pyramid 1exts where Ja1nes Allen has shovvn :hat it is perhaps possible that she represents the atmosphere of the lovver \-vorld just as Shu represents the atmosphere of the upper - as it is said that
'the earth (Geb) is held up under Nut (the sky) by your arms, Tefnut' (PT 1405). According to one story Shu and Tefnut were said to be created in the form of tvvo lion cubs which also gave the goddess a distinct leonine identity. "fefnut v1as thus an 'Eye of Re', and a late papyrus tells how she quarrelled \vith the sun god and taking leonine form flew in a rage to Nubia from where she \Vas eventually persuaded to return by the god Thoth.
(conography
Tefnut could be depicted in fully anthropomorphic form but \Vas most often represented as a lioness or lioness-headed goddess in reference to her leonine associations. In human or semi-anthropomorphic form, she may wear a long wig and a solar disk and uraeus atop her head. Like other leonine goddesses, Tefnut ,vas frequently represented on cultic aegises and counterpoises, sometimes together vvith her brother-husband Shu in an unusual dual-headed design. ~['he goddess could also be depicted as a rearing serpent upon a sceptre, and sometin1es as a lion-headed serpent.
Worship
The main cult centres of Tefnut were at Heliopolis where she had a sanctuary as one of the members of that city's great Ennead, and at Leontopolis (modern Tell el-Muqda1n) in the Delta where she vvas \vorshipped ,vith her brother-husband Shu in the
form of a pair of lions. Amulets and plaques of Tefnut are kno\vn from the Late Period, but popular veneration of the goddess \Vas probably mainly localized around her cult centres.
Tutu
A some\.vhat obscure apotropaic god venerated mainly in the Graeco-Roman Period, Tutu was called 'he ,:vho keeps enemies at a distance' and "vas believed to provide protection from hostile manifestations of deities and demons. The god v1as said to be the son of Neith, and was depicted in the form of a \valking lion or as a composite deity v>1ith human head, the body of a lion, the \.Vings of a bird and a tail which \.vas a snake.
HI PP OPOTA MINE DEITIES
The hippopotamus was vievved qui te ambivalently in ancient Egypt. The male animal \.vas regarded as dangerous and destructive and was therefore often associated \vith the god Seth. The female hippopotamus, ho•..vever, vvhile possessing the sa1ne strength and destructive potential, was regarded benignly as a protective force and a symbol of motherhood.

the female hippopotamus deity: 1pet, Reret and Taweret. Generally their characteristics \Vere similar and it is often impossible to tell then1 apart, yet it is not always clear whether they should be viewed as differing forms of the same goddess or as separate, if largely conflated, deities.
/pet
Mythology
The benign hippopotamus goddess Ipet \vas a protective and nourishing deity. In the Pyramid Texts the king asks that he may nurse at her breast so that he would 'neither thirst nor hunger...forever' (PT 381- 82) and in later funerary papyri she is called 'mistress of magical protection'. Her name means 'hare1n' or 'favoured place' and under the epithet Ipet-'vveret, 'the great lpet', the goddess fuses to some degree with Taweret 'the great one', but she nevertheless maintains some independent characteristics. Ipet appears to have had a strong connection \vith the Theban area and it is possible that the goddess rnay have served as a personification of that city. In Theban theology she was considered the mother of Osiris and as a result her afterlife associations are clear in the funerary texts in 'vvhich she appears.
Iconography
!pet, like the other deities in this section, was usually depicted as a fusion of hippopotamus, crocodile, human, and lion, though the hippopotamine aspect of her appearance is primary. She was depicted as a fema le hippopotamus, usually standing upright on legs 'vvhich have the feet of a lion. Her arrns are often hun1an in appearance though they usually terminate in leonine pa\vs and she was also depicted \<\11th large pendent human breasts and the swollen belly of a pregnant woman. The back and tail of the goddess are those of a crocodile and sometimes this aspect is sho\.vn as a complete crocodile stretched over her back. Sometin1es her representations appear to be apotropaic in nature, and in the vignettes of funerary papyri (as in Spell 137 of the Book of the Dead of Ani) the goddess is sho'vvn holding a torch and lighting incense cones to provide light and heat for the deceased.
Worship
Ipet was particularly venerated in the region of Thebes. She appears as a protective figure on the back of a statue of a 17th-dynasty ruler of the area, and although in most areas there \Vas no cult associated with the goddess, a temple of Ipet ,vas built just 'Nest of the temple of Khonsu within the complex of the Great Temple of Amun at Karnak in the Late Period and Ptolemaic times. According to Theban beliefs it was at this place that the goddess rested \.Vhen she gave birth to Osiris.
Reret
Mythology
The name Reret means 'sow', and under that name or Reret-weret 'the great so'vv', or in the fonn of Nebet-akhet 'rnistress of the horizon' (an epithet also given to Taweret), the hippopotamus goddess represented one of the constellations of the northern sky as visualized by the Egyptians. This seems to have been the constellation \.Ve no\v call Draco in \.Vhich the ancient pole star, T huban, is situated; and in this role the stellar hippopotamus seems to have secured the 'in1perishable' circumpolar stars which revolved around her. Perhaps due to her celestial associations Reret (and sometimes her other hippopotamine counterparts) 1,vas identified ,vith the goddesses Nut and Hathor and \vas also seen as a protectress of the sun.
Iconography
The basic iconography of Reret - as a composite hippopotamus goddess ,vith pendulous breasts and swollen belly - does not usually differ from that of her counterparts, though in astronomical contexts she takes on some specific attributes. vVhile Reret may hold the knife, torch, sa or ankh signs found \•vith all forrns of the hippopotamus goddess, in astronomical paintings such as that on the ceiling of the tomb of Sethos I in the Valley of the Kings, she is frequently depicted holding a tnooring post sometimes in the form of a crocodile - to which is tethered one or more of the northern, circumpolar

constellations in the form of an ox. There are also \·ariants \vhich show the goddess holding a rope attached to a foreleg ·which symbolizes the same t:onstellation. In these depictions marks on the chest ~r arm of the hippopotamus may have represented :he ancient pole star Tbuban.
Worship
:.:nlike Ipet, Reret does not seem to have enjoyed the --t:rvice of a cult in her 01.vn na1ne; and unless she is ie\ved as only a form of Tav.reret, neither did she ~.-:n·e amulets or other evidences of popular venera••n.
Shepet
Shepet v.ras a female hippopotamine deity vvho appears to be a form or name variant of Reret or Ta,:,veret. In some cases, as in the Roman birth house _c Dendera, the goddess appears with typical Ta\veret'-like iconography but with the head of a - xodile.
Taweret
1ythology
·.nveret (Egyptian 'the great [female] one'), along ::h her counterparts, is attested since Old ~ ~gdom times. She is the most commonly encoun:-ed form of the Egyptian hippopotan1us iddesses and had a number of mythological asso;.ations.Sometimes the hippopotamus goddess vvas quated vvith Isis -for example, in some of the Late -eriod cippi - though the connection between tbe m·o deities is not ahvays clear. More frequently Ta,\·eret is equated with Hathor vvhose headdress 1e often shares.

Because the male ppopotamus was associated with Seth in Egyptui re1igion, Ta\veret was called the 'concubine of
·h· w·ho, according to Plutarch, had become one of c ·followers of Horus'.However, Taweret ,vas also -d to be the consort of the god Bes.
conography
,·eret is depicted ,vith pendulous breasts and the ,:!en belly of a pregnant ,voman. The goddess .!ally \vears a female wig \Vhich may be surunted with a feathered headdress, a modius, or
with horns and solar disk. She is usually shown with her mouth open or her lips pulled back to reveal rows of teeth in a grimace which perhaps emphasizes her protective function. rrhe main attributes of the goddess are the sa symbol of protection, the ankh symbol of life, and the torch, the flan1e of \,vhich \1/as intended both to dispel darkness and to expel inimical forces. Usually the sa symbol is the largest of these attributes and is placed on the ground before the goddess who rests one or both paws upon it. Variants of Taweret include forms of the goddess with the head of a cat or the head of a human \voman, as seen in a carved vvooden unguent jar in the form of Taweret (or Ipet) but \.vith the features of Queen Tiye. A small faience figure (probably a copy of an 18th-dynasty object) is known of much later - Ptolemaic - date which follows this same form, but \Vith the more pronounced facial features of the Amarna Period.

the related goddess lpet (Opet) at Karnak, Tav"eret 1,vas one of the Egyptian deities ,vho regularly had no formal cult. Nevertheless, judging by the number
of images of the goddess that have survived, Taweret appears to have been one of the most popular of Egyptian household deities. The goddess is one of the earliest recognizable apotropaic deities and she is widely represented on amulets from Old Kingdom times onward. She was represented on beds, head-rests and other small items of furniture as vvell as on cosmetic items such as unguent pots and spoons, and on various items with fertility significance such as the so-called 'paddle dolls'. Faience vases, similar to the small jars in human form \vhich were made to hold mother's milk, were made in the shape of the goddess with pouring holes at the nipples. probably to hold milk for magical use. Interestingly, large numbers of Taweret amulets \¥ere found in the excavated houses of Akhenaten's capital at el-Amarna, and Bes and Taweret images decorated some of the rooms there. In a similar manner, some of the houses in the workmen's village at Deir el-Medina in western Thebes contained a roorn with a bed-shaped altar and wall paintings depicting Bes, Taweret and naked women ,vhich may have been associated
\Vith childbirth rituals. In her role as a protective
deity, Taweret spread as a result of Egyptian trade in the wider Mediterranean ,,._,orld and eventually entered the iconography of Minoan Crete, for example, where her form remains recognizable despite the modification of her role as a goddess of ,vater.

Egyptian religion embraced a number of canine deities from ancient times. Some of these deities were clearly represented by the wolf \.Vhile others such as Anubis himself - were more generic and exhibit qualities of both the dog and the jackal. Regardless of their specific origin, canine deities frequently represent mortuary and afterlife concerns and almost all were eventua1ly associated in some way with the cult of Osiris. In some cases, however, the connection between certain canine deities and the person of the king is clear.

Anubis
Mythology
Before the rise of Osiris, i\nubis was the most i1nportant Egyptian funerary god. Originally he appears to have been primarily concerned with the burial and afterlife of the king, though eventually this role \vas extended to incorporate all the dead. One Egyptian text derives the na1ne of Anubis from a verb meaning 'putrefy', and his name \vas also linked to a word for 'king's son', perhaps in relation to Osiris, but these are probably later, contrived etyrr101ogies, and the original meaning of the name is unsure. The god's association vvith the dead probably originated in the habit of desert canines scavenging in the shallow graves of early cemeteries, and, as \Alas common in Egyptian protective magic, the form of the threat was then utilized in order to provide protection for the dead. During the Old Kingdom the prayers carved on funerary stelae and on the walls of the mastaba tornbs were addressed directly to him, and in the Pyramid Texts he is mentioned dozens of times in connection with the king's burial. Eventually the cult of Anubis vvas assimilated to that of Osiris who was said to be the
father of Anubis who in turn was said to have ,:vrapped the body of the underworld god, thus tying his role in mummification to the worship of Osiris. Differing myths have survived regarding the parentage of Anubis, ho,vever. In the Coffin Texts he is the son of the cow goddess Hesat, and also the son of Bastet. According to other stories he vvas the son of Seth or of Re and Nephthys while Plutarch records the tradition that he was the son of Nephthys but by Osiris and ,vas subsequently adopted by Isis as her own son. The central, mortuary character of Anubis is vvell illustrated in the epithets ,vhich ,vere given to him. There vvere many of these, but some of the most frequently used titles of the god summarize much of his essential nature.
Fore1nost of the ivesterners: Because the majority of the Egyptians' cemeteries were constructed on the western bank of the Nile- the symbolic direction of the setting sun and the underworld - the deceased were referred to as 'westerners'. Thus, the epithet khenty-irnentiu., 'foremost of the ,vesterners', refers to the role of Anubis as the leader of the dead. The title was taken from the earlier canine deity of that name that Anubis superseded at Abydos.
Lordof the sacredland: The epithet neb-ta-djeseror 'lord of the sacred land' is similar in signifying the supren1acy of Anubis over the desert areas where the necropoleis ,vere located. 1'he vvord djeser is often translated pure, so this epithet sometimes appears in translation as 'lord of the pure land'. In addition to this general epithet Anubis also bore many titles relating him to specific areas in Egypt such as 'lord of the vVhite Land', meaning the area of Gebelein.
He ivho is upon his sacred 1nountain: Anubis tepydju-ef, \.vho is upon his mountain', is a title probably based on the image of the jackal god vvatching over the burials of the dead from the heights of the desert cliffs overlooking the necropoleis. The expression was a general one relating to the high desert areas to the 1,vest of the Nile rather than any particular n1ountain.
Rider of the bou;s: In the Pyramid Texts there is a reference to 'the Jackal, the Governor of the B0\1/S,...Anubis' (PT 805), which refers to the socalled 'nine bows' - nine ethnically differentiated figures depicted as literal bov1.1s or as bound captives who represented the enemies of Egypt. This expression underlies the motif used in the seal \Vhich vvas placed upon the entrances to the royal tombs of the Valley of the Kings in the New l{ingdom and which sho\.ved the figure of Anubis crouching above the nine bows, symbolizing the god's control of evildoers ,vho might endanger the burial or the undel"'vvorld enemies of the dead.

He who is in the place of e1nbalming: Anubis i1ny-ut - 'who is in the place of embalming' - specifically referred to the role of Anubis in the embalming process and as 1naster of the per wabet, the ritual tent or pavilion \Vhere embalming \Vas carried out. lVIythologically it was Anubis \vho e1nbalmed the body of Osiris and the deceased king and who then protected it along with the containers in which the internal organs were preserved - a process knoi,vn to have been carried out from at least the beginning of the 4th dynasty.
Foremost of the divirze booth: The epithet khenty-sekh -netjer can symbolically refer to either the embalming booth or the burial chamber, or even to the shrine in which the coffin and sarcophagus \.Vere placed in New Kingdom royal burials. The god is often depicted in this role in his zoomorphic form atop funerary chests, and thestatue of Anubis seated upon a gilded rnodel shrine \vhich ,vas found in the tomb of Tutankharnun symbolized this epithet specifically.
During the Graeco-Roman Period Anubis was transformed in a number of \vays and took up nevv roles, becoming something of a cosmic deity reigning over the earth and sky and being related to arcane "visdom as the bringer of light to humanity. In his original mortuary role he was also associated with the Greek Hekate and \.Vith Hennes Psychopompos vvho, in Greek mythology, conducted the souls of the deceased to the shores of the River Styx.
Iconography
The various roles played by Anubis are seen in the iconography and representation of the god. In zoomorphic form, the identity of the animaldepicted in representations of Anubis is uncertain, as the term
used by the Egyptians for hin1, sab, was used of the jackal and of other canines. The animal bears certain traits of the dog family such as the long muzzle, its round-pupilled eyes, five-toed forefeet and four-toed hind feet, ,vhile on the other hand, its

tail is wide and club shaped and characteristically carried down more like that of the jackal, fox or \volf. It is therefore possible that the original Anubis animal was a hybrid form, perhaps a jackal crossed \.vith some type of dog. The black colouring of the animal was certainly symbolic and was connected 1..vith the discolouration of the corpse after its preparation for burial and the black colouration of the fertile earth which was itself a symbol of regenerarion. In this animal form, Anubis is usually depicted lying on a shrine or simply as if he were doing so, with his ears erect, his legs stretched out before him, and his tail hanging down, vertically, behind him. Often he \Vears a collar and a ceremonial tie around h is neck, and either a sehhe1n sceptre or flail (or both) may be depicted rising from his back. Anthropo1norphically, the god is depicted - with rare fully human exceptions - with the head of the ..\nubis animal on a human body and sometimes ,vith a tail, though usually without specific items of insignia or other iconographic attributes. He is shovvn pe1iorming the 'opening of the mouth' ceremony on the mummy and statues of the deceased, attending the mummy in the tomb and escorting the spirit of the deceased into the undenvorld. He is frequently depicted weighing the heart of the deceased against the feather of truth in the presence of Thoth and also leading the deceased before Osiris. His mythical role in protecting Isis at the time of her giving birth to Horus and his relationship 'vvith the we1l-being of the king led to the appearance of Anubis in the mammisi or birthhouses of the Graeco-Roman Period. In very late representations, as on the vvalls of the catacombs of ..\lexandria, Anubis could be sho\vn dressed in the

Worship
Anubis 'vvas the chief deity of the 17th Upper Egyptian name in l\1iddle Egypt and its capital which the Greeks called Cynopolis or 'city of the dogs' (the modern el-Qeis), but his cult 'vvas recognized throughout Egypt and chapels and images of the god occur in mortuary temples and in tombs throughout the pharaonic period. The chapel of Anubis in the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri n1ay have given continuity to an earlier shrine of the god in that area and provides an excellent example of the continuing importance of the god long after his assimilation into the cult of Osiris. Because he was said to have prepared the mummy of Osiris, Anubis becan1e the patron god of embalmers, and in the Memphite necropolis an area associated v.ith the embalmers seems to have become something of a focal point for the cult of Anubis in the Late Period and Ptolemaic times and has been termed the Anubeion by modern Egyptologists. Masks of the god are kno\vn, and priests representing Anubis at the preparation of the mummy and the burial rites may have 'vvorn these jackal-headed masks in order to impersonate the god; they v.1ere certainly utilized for processional use as this is depicted representationally and is mentioned in late texts. The many two- and three-dimensional representations of Anubis which have survived from funerary contexts indicate the god's great importance in this
aspect of Egyptian religion and amulets of the god were also common. The fragmentary royal annals
preserved on the Palermo Stone show that in the Old Kingdom, s1:atues of Anubis, called 'births' of the god, 'vvere also made to designate certain years, indicating his importance in yet another \vay.

Input was the female counterpart of Anubis.

Sed
Sed was an ancient jackal- like god \.Vho may have been an independent deity or, alternatively, related in some way to the jackal god Wepwawet. The earliest textual attestation of the name Sed is found on the 5th-dynasty Palermo Stone, and he appears as the theophoric element in personal names up through the Midd le Kingdom when he appears to be replaced by Wepvva\vet in this context. This and other evidence suggests the possibility that Wep

after this god. Sed was also associated 'vvith Maat in certain ways and may have been viewed as a champion of justice similar to Maat herself.
Wepwawet
Mythology
\Vepwavvet was possibly the oldest of Egypt's jackal gods, being already represented on one of the standards preceding the king on the Nar1ner Palette at the dawn of Egypt's historical period and attested by name from the 3rd dynasty. 1'he archaeological evidence indicates that the god's origins were probably in the region oi Upper Egypt, but his worship soon spread; and in the Pyramid 1exts he is even said to have been born in the Lower
Egyptian shrine of the goddess vVadjet (PT 1438). \Vep\.vawet translates as 'opener of the ways', but the meaning of the god's name is susceptible to a nwnber of interpretations. Based on the god's frequently attested \varlike character, it could refer io the opening of the ways before the king in terms
of military conquest. In the context of the 'adze of \Vepwawet' \vhich was used in the 'opening of the mouth' ritual, it could also refer to the magical openjng of the deceased king's eyes and mouth, and in funerary texts Wepv,rawet also 'opened the ways' in leading the deceased through the netherv,1orld and the king to ascension (PT 1009). The title could be even understood in a cosrnic sense as he is said to open the vvay for the sun to rise in the sky (PT 455). ...\s 'leader of the gods', the image of Wepvvawet

went before the king and before other gods in many events and the name could possibly relate to his leading of these ritual processions. Finally, in the Nlemphite Theology we find the expression 'the opener of the body, Wepwavvet', so that as a firstborn the god could be seen as the opener of the ,vay of the \VOmb. Wepwa\vetand Anubis are sometimes confused - even in the ancient texts - but it is clear that they were independent deities. On the other hand, Wep,vav,ret may have been synonymous 'vvitb the god Sed who was depicted as a canid atop an identical standard in early times. In a less direct manner, Wepwawet was identified with the god Horus and could also be associated ,:vith the sun god in the form of Wepwawet-Re.
Iconography
Wepwawet was usually depicted in the form of a jackal or other ,vild canid and occasionally as a jackal-headed man. In zoomorphic form the god may be differentiated from Anubis when colour is present, as Anubis was usually depicted as black and vVepwawet, grey. vVhen standing, the latter animal was also characteristically depicted \Vith its sloping back legs together rather than apart. But as a jackal-headed 1nan the god often appears indistinguishable from Anubis and can then only be differentiated by a na1ning text, if not by his attributes of mace and bow.

of the Dead Anubis and 'vVepwawet are depicted on either side of a representation of Osiris. As symbols of north and south or east and west are also usually depicted on each side, it seems clear that the two gods could have symbolic orientational significance - with Anubis often being linked to the north and Wepwa\vet the south. When depicted on his standard, Wep\,va\vet usually has before hi1n a peculiar bolster-Eke e1nblem cal.led the shedshed which may have represented the royal placenta which was regarded as the king's 'double'.
Worship
In later historical times the major cult centre of Wepvvawet was at Asyut in Middle Egypt which vvas called by the Egyptians Zauty and by the Greeks Lykopolis or 'wolf city'. The god was also venerated at Abydos in connection vvith Osiris. There Wepv1a\.vet went before the ritual funerary procession of the nether\vorld god, and on funerary stelae from this site it is common for the deceased to wish to 'behold the beauty of Wep-1.vawet during the procession'. The god was also depicted on standards placed before the tomb in s01ne depictions of funerary ceremonies. While infrequently found in expressions of popular veneration, Wepvvawet appears in some theophoric names - as in the name of King vVepv,,awetemsaf of the 13th dynasty.
OVINE DEITIES
Most ovine deities ,vere, in fact, male ram gods and the majority were tied to fairly specific locations.
The greatest of these vvas the god Khnum of the region of Elephantine, though a number of lesser ram-gods enjoyed considerable status in their ov.;n areas. Due to the similarity of the ono,natopoeic
name of the ram 'ba' and the ba spirit, a number of ram gods \Vere vvorshipped as the ba of great gods such as Re or Osiris.
Banebdjedet
Mythology
An ancient ra1n god of vvhom little is knO\VO in
terms of his origins, Banebdjedet means 'the ba
Lord of Djedet' (the city of Mendes). Because ba, the onomatopoeic vvord for ram, sounded like the word ba meaning spirit or soul, mythologically the god was supposed to have represented the soul of Osiris; and in the Late Period this association was widened to four n1anifestations - as the soul of Re, Osiris, Shu and Geb - an aspect of his nature \vhich added considerably to his importance. As a ram god Banebdjedet was also credited \vith strong sexual powers and an account preserved in the temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu states that the god Tatenen transformed himself into Banebdjedet in order to copulate vvith the king's mother so as to become the father of Ramesses. The god also appears in the somewhat later story from the reign of Ramesses V ,vhich is pre.served in Papyrus Chester Beatty I and which tells the story of the 'Contendings of Horus and Seth'. In this tale Banebdjedet plays an important role in counselling the gods to seek the advice of
Neith \vhose judgment in the dispute is eventually followed. The god ,vas made famous in the writings of the Classical authors, especially the Greek geographer Strabo, the poet Pindar and the Rornan historian Diodorus of Sicily.
Iconography
Banebdjedet was depicted as either a ram or rainheaded n1an or, as is sometimes the case, as the head of a ram alone. From New Kingdom times he 1,.vas often depicted as having four heads - t\.VO facing forvvard and two facing back-to symbolize his various aspects as the souls of the four gods he represented.
Worship
The main cult centre of Banebdjedet was at Mendes (modern Tell el-Rub'a) in the northeast Delta region \Vhere the god 1,.vas worshipped along with his consort, the dolphin or fish goddess Hatmehyt, and his son Harpokrates. A cemetery \vith the sarcophagi for the burial of the sacred rams of the god has been excavated there, though little else remains of his cult. Although of considerable importance in the Delta region, Banebdjedet tended to be supplanted by other



ram deities in southern Egypt, though the god's mythology demonstrates a wide and lasting veneration. According to the Greek Pindar the ram \Vas scandalously allowed to have intercourse with women in the course of its veneration, though this is not documented in Egyptian sources. Ram-headed amulets of the Late Period 1nay represent this deity, and certainly do when they have four heads to depict the god's quadrapartite nature.
Heryshef
Mythology
The name of the ram god Heryshef - literally 'he who is upon his lake' - has been seen as suggesting a creator god who emerged from the waters of the first primeva) lake, but could just as Ekely refer to a feature such as a sacred lake of the god's main cult centre. The Greek historian Plutarch rendered the god's name as 'Arsaphes', translating the word as 'manliness', though this seems to be based on an apparent etymology suggested by the procreative aspect \A/bich \vas an essential part of the god's nature. To the Greeks Heryshef was Herakles and so his major cult site, the Egyptian Hnes, was named Herakleopolis by them. Mythologically Heryshef became associated with both Osiris and Re and was kno..,vn as the ba of these great gods. He was also assoctated \\Tith Atum vvho was linked \vith the sacred 'naret' (perhaps sycamore) tree of Hnes.
Iconography
Heryshef was usually represented as a long-horned ram or a ram-headed man. In zoo-anthropomorphic guise the god was depicted in a kingly pose wearing a royal kilt but with the head of a ram. Due to his association with Osiris, Heryshef was also frequently shown as a ram or a ram-headed man wearing the Atef Crown, and due to his links 1,.vith Re he was also depicted in both forms wearing the disk of the sun god.
Worship
The main centre of vvorship for this god \vas the to\lvn of Hnes or Herakleopolis Magna near the modern town of Beni Suef in Middle Egypt. The god's cult is attested at this site as early as the 1st dynasty in the records preserved on the Palermo Stone, and Heryshef is known to have risen to considerable importance during the First Intermediate Period when Hnes served as the capital of northern Egypt - though the earliest temple structures that have been found so far at this cult site date to Middle Kingdo1n times. The temple of Heryshef \Vas greatly enlarged in New Kingdom rimes, especially by Ramesses II, and appears to have thrived down to the end of the pharaonic

period. In popular religion, Heryshef appears on ivory \Vands of the Middle Kingdom and is also doubtless the deity represented by many ram or ram-headed amulets of the later periods.
Kherty
Kherty, whose name means 'lo\ver one', was a chthonic deity, a ram-god ,.vho inhabited the netherworld and vvho thus could act as a deity of hostility or protection. The god appears in the Pyramid Texts (PT 1308) \.vhere he is said to be the 'chin' of the king among many deities representing the deceased monarch's body, and in the Old Kingdom he was associated with Osiris as a benevolent partner of the under\vorld god ,vho could aid in protecting the king's tomb. On the other hand, Kherty also exhibited a negative side and it was said that Re himself must protect the king from Kherty's malevolence (PT 350). Kherty \Vas usual1y depicted as a ram, but may also appear in the form of a bull or a lion, and in any of these forms he could have associations \vith the sun god Re. Kherty's ovine form also led to his association 1Nith

Khnum
Mythology
Khnum was one of Egypt's most important rain gods and \.vas associated ,vith the Nile and with the creation of life. Particularly linked to the first cataract, Khnum was said to control the inundation of
the Nile from the caverns of that region, and as a result of this power as well as the inherent procreative power of the ram, the god was viewed as a personification of creative force. His association with the Nile and \Vith its fertile soil perhaps contributed to his portrayal as a potter who was said to have shaped all living things upon his wheel. As a result of his creative ability and because the ono
matopoeic word for ram - 'ba'- \.vas similar to the
spiritual aspect or ba of living things Khnum ,vas held to be the ba of Re. The sun god \vas thus depicted as a ram-headed being in his netherworld representations- and Khnum himself is sometimes called l{hnum-Re. In a similar manner Khnu1n was also held to be the ba of the gods Geb and Osiris. At
Esna Khnum was associated not only with the lion goddess Menhyt, but also with the goddess Neith. Khnum's association v,1ith the N'ile made hi1n 'lord of the crocodiles', probably suggesting his link to Neith who was mother of the chief crocodile god, Sobek. At Elephantine he \.Vas the head of a triad including the goddesses Satis and Anukis who were also as-sociated ·with the same geographic area.
Iconography
Khnum \Vas most frequently depicted in semianthropomorphic form as a ram-headed god wearing a short kilt and a long, tripartite wig. Originally he was depicted \1/ith the horizontal, undulating horns of Ovis lo1igipes, the first species of sheep to be raised in Egypt, but as ti1ne progressed he \Vas also depicted with the short curved horns of the Ovis platyra ram (the 'Amun rarn') and may thus have two sets of horns atop his head. He was also called 'high of plumes' and may ,1.1ear t,vo ta ll feathers, or the plumed Atef Crown, or the White Crown of Upper Egypt on his head. His n1ost distinctive attribute, ho\vever, was his potter's wheel, with which he was often depicted moulding a child as a concrete representation of his creative \Vork. This motif \.vas naturally utilized in the mammisi or birth houses of temples where Khnum 1,,vas shown forming the infant king, but the motif also

appears elsewhere. Khnum may also be depicted in the fully zoomorphic form of a \.valking ram as in many amulets and pectoral decorations. but these representations are often extremely difficult to disinguish from those of other ram deities such as Heryshef \Vithout inscriptiona.l evidence.

his widespread recognition as a god associated with childbirth, but his role as controller of the Nile also deserved veneration, and amulets of the god may have been made vvith either or both of these powers in rnind. The so-called Famine Stela of Sehel Island near the first cataract preserves an appeal to the god at a time of famine caused by seven years of lo\v inundations. The inscription dates to Ptolemaic ti1nes, but is a copy or forgery of a text from the time of the 3rd-dynasty king Djoser.

- seems to have been of i1naginary hybrid form and \Vas also a deity of considerable standing.
Babi
Mythology
A fiercely aggressive baboon god known from Old
Kingdom times, Babi is mentioned in the Pyramid Texts where he appears as the powerful guardian of
the sky. The god's power is linked directly to his sexual potency and aggression, so that his phallus is said to be the doorbolt by which the sky is opened
or closed, and is also said to be the mast of the underworld ferryboat. 'fhe king aspires to this god's power in the afterlife and is associated with the god directly so that it is said 'The king is Babi, Lord of the night sky, Bull of the baboons' (PT 516). The behaviour of the god is often clearly that of unrestrained aggression; he was said to live on human entrails and to murder unhesitatingly. In PT 1349 he is accused of having stolen the offering of a goddess and he is sometimes identified \Vith Seth, the god of chaos and destruction. Yet despite Babi's vicious nature, his great po\JJer could be used to ward off snakes and other harmful creatures and even to control certain inanimate dangers. His virility could also be channelled positively, and in later periods 1,,vhen protective or healingspells associated specific deities with various parts of the body, Babi ,vas the god usually associated with the penis. In the Book of the Dead the deceased seeks to become identified \.vith Babi in the process of his transformation into an eternal son of Osi1·is.
Iconography
Babi vvas portrayed in zoomorphic form as a great male baboon ,:vith heavy inane and often with a prominent sexual member. ln the Pyra111id Texts he is specifically described as 'red of ear and purple of hindquarters' (PT 1349); and this colouration is sometimes applied in representations of the god, perhaps to differentiate him from the baboon of Thoth and to help stress his violent nature.
Worship
Although without a formal cult, Babi's appearances in the Pyramid Texts and later 'afterlife books' show his importance as a mythological force in Egyptian religion \Vith spells existing both for protection from the god and for the utilization of bis powers. Amulets thought to represent Babi may demonstrate that the god's power was sought both in life and for the afterlife.
Mafdet
Mythology
The goddess l\ilafdet (the meaning of \vhose nan1e is not clear) was an ancient protective deity, attested from the 1st dynasty, who was associated with a feline or mongoose-like predator whose ferocity was believed to prevail over the attacks of snakes and scorpions. In the Pyramid Texts the goddess protects
the sun god Re and also the deceased king from such dangers: 'i'v1afdet leaps at the neck of the indief snake...again at the neck of the serpent \Vith raised
head' (PT 438), and the teeth and claws of the l\ilafdet animal are thus likened to knives and the barbs of harpoons (PT 440--42, 1212) vvhich are said to decapitate her enemies. In f'v1iddle Kingdom times Mafdet was depicted on various magical objects as an apotropaic deity, and from this same period she is sometimes paired vvith the scorpion goddess Hededet in her protective role. Destruction of harmful creatures could also be symbolic of the punishment of wrong doers: in the New Kingdom funerary works Mafdet appears in scenes of the afterlife judgment hall in the capacity of punisher or executioner.
Iconography
The identity of the animal by which Mafdet is usually represented is difficult to ascertain as different types of evidence suggest different possibilities. In some cases a feline predator seems to be intended, but in many others a smaller animal such as the civet, ocelot or ichneumon (the African rnongoose) must be meant. The goddess was also associated with the 'instrument of punishment' (PT 230) perhaps used in executions from very early times. This consisted of a pole, curved at the top, to \vhich a knife was lashed with a length of rope and seems to have been car

In her zoomorphic form as the serpent-killing predator, iVIafdet was sometimes shown running up the pole of this instrument. The solar association of the goddess - as protector of Re - led to the representation of the Mafdet animal \-vith a solar disk - and sometimes a uraeus-atop its head.
Worship
A.lthough she had no cult of her own, l\1afdet is mentioned in several temple inscriptions - especially of the latest periods - and she ,:vas also invoked in magical rituals which utilized her mythological strengths in everyday life. A spell to counter the harmful effect of a demon or ghost that has sw-vived from the 21st dynasty applied the assistance of the goddess in an interesting if somewhat bizarre manner. 'fhe spell was to be spoken over a phallus-shaped loaf inscribed ,vith the name of the harmful supernatural being; this \vas then ,vrapped in fatty tneat and given to a cat - as the anima l consumed the magical loaf it was believed that Mafclet herself ,vould destroy the influence of the malevolent po\ver.
Seth
Mythology
Seth seems to have been originally a desert deity who early came to represent the forces of disturbance and confusion in the v.rorld. He is attested from the earliest periods and survived until late in the dynastic age, but the history of the god appears as tumultuous as his character. An ivory artifact carved in his distinctive forn1 is known fro1n the Naqada I Period (c. 4000-3500 BC), and the god appears on standards carved on the macehead of the protodynastic ruler Scorpion, indicating that he ,vas certainly ,vell established by this time. In the 2nd dynasty the figure of Seth appears on the serekh (the device in \,vhich the king's name was vvritten) of Peribsen and together with Horus on the serekh of Khasekhem,vy, indicating an equality at this time \vith the great falcon god. Yet after this the god seems to have lost 'Orne prominence, though in the Old Kingdom his importance is seen in his many appearances in the Pyramid Texts. By the Middle Kingdom Seth \Vas assimilated into solar theology as the god vvho stood in the bo"v of the sun god's barque to repel the cosmic S<:rpent Apophis, and \Vas already incorporated into theHeliopolitan Ennead as the son of thesky goddess \ ut,and the brother of Osiris, Isis and Nephthys. In rhe Hyksos Period Seth \Vas identified by the foreign rulers with their own god Baal and rose to great importance as their chief deity. vVhile not as imporrant in the early New Kingdom, in the 19th and 20th dynasties the god was elevated as a kind of patron deity of the Ramessid kings - some of whom bore his name (e.g., Sethos 'man of Seth', and Sethnakhte
'Seth is mighty'). But evidence for Seth declines after the 20th dynasty, and his role as god of the desert and foreign lands led to his association in the later periods with Egypt's hated foreign enemies such as the Assyrians. By the 25th dynasty, in fact, widespread veneration of Seth had virtually ended, yet he remains a fascinating if ominous deity whose character and mythology reflect both negative and positive aspects.
God of violence, chaos and confusion: Seth vvas the 'Reel One', the ill-tempered god \,vho personified anger, rage and violence, and who vvas often regarded as evil personined. As the god of chaos he opposed the harmony of maat (b·uth) and \vas a veritable dark side to the fabric of the universe. As a god of the desert or 'Red Land', he opposed and threatened the vegetation upon which life itself depended; and as the inimical foe of Osiris, rightful king of Egypt, he represented rebellion and strife. In Egyptian writing the Seth animal ,vas used as the

determinative sign for many 1,vords connoting confusion and chaos at the personal, social and cosmic levels. These aspects are all reflected in Egyptian mythology. An early tradition claimed that at birth he savagely tore himself free from his mother (PT
205), and his mythical relationships are characterized by dispute and violence. According to legend he murdered his brother Osiris and then engaged in a bitter contest - lasting 80 years - \Vith Osiris' son and heir Horus whom Seth challenged for the role of rulership. In this ongoing contest Seth put out the eye of Horus who in turn castrated Seth, doubtless an allusion to the suppression of the sexual povver and violence of the god who was associated with rape and unnatural sexual desire. Although his sister Nephthys was said to be his vvife, even she left him to become a 'follo\ver of Horus' - as did the hippopotamus goddess Taweret 1Nho was also said to be a consort of Seth along with the violent Sen1itic goddesses Astarte and Anat. In the Pyramid Texts (PT 1521) Seth is also paired with the sometirnes be1ligerent goddess Neith. The god's fearsome character is seen in Egyptian funerary literature of the Ne\v Kingdom where he is said to lurk in the nether"vorld and to seize the soul of the deceased, and his malevolent character "vas thought to be expressed in this world also: in all kinds of problems and crimes, in sickness and disease, as well as civil unrest and foreign invasion. He was associated \Vith storms and bad weather of all types and ,vas also thought to be the god of the ,vide, raging sea. i\!Iythologically he could be identified 1,vith other malignant Egyptian deities including the great chaos serpent Apophis, and he was identified by the Greeks with their own rebellious god Typhon.
God of strength, cunning andprotective poiver: The character of Seth ,vas not entirely ini.Jnical, however, as he was also held to be cunning and of great strength and these qualities could be put to good use. One of his most comn1on epithets was 'great of strength' and his sceptre was said to weigh the equivalent of son1e 2,000 kg (4,500 lb). He ,vas the lord of metals; iron, the hardest metal known to the
~
tJ()
Egyptians, "vas ca11ed 'the bones of Seth'. In the Pyrarnid Texts it is the strength of Seth that the deceased pharaoh claims (PT 1145) and many living kings linked the1nselves to hin1. The warrior Tuth
mosis III called himself 'beloved of Seth', for example,
and Ramesses II is said to have fought like Seth at the great Battle of Kadesh. The strength of Seth is also utilized in representational motifs associated witb kingship, as in the scenes carved on the thrones of statues of Sen\.vosret I in the Egyptian lVIuseum in Cairo which show Seth opposite Horus in the sen1a-ta1,vy motif binding the symbolic e1nblems of the two halves of the land. Here the strength of the god as well as his juxtaposition ,vith Horus is implicit in the scene. Even the gods utilized this god's help. Thus, although Seth could be identified with the chaos serpent Apophis, he also was the sun god's defender against the sa1ne monster, and a partially preserved myth tells how the strength and cunning of Seth were used to save the goddess Astarte from the baleful sea god Yam vrho had dernandecl her as tribute. Seth could also protect and help in other, 1nore mundane ways. A diplomatic text ,vhich tells of Ramesses II's marriage to a Hittite princess explains how the king prayed to Seth to mitigate the severe weather conditions \vhich were obstructing the princess's journey to Egypt, and the god's help vvas similarly sought by many common people for protection or the removal of adverse conditions.
Iconography
Seth ,vas originally depicted as an animal ,vith a curved head, tall square-topped ears, and erect arrow-like tail. In the earliest clear examples of the creature it is depicted standing, though later representations often sho\:v it in a seated or crouching stance. The god's importance is clear in his representations. A 12th-dynasty pectoral now in the fvlyers iVluseun1 of Eton College shows the Seth animal in this representational form, in juxtaposition \x,,ith the god Horus as emblems of the two kingdoms. The close association betvveen Seth and the rulers of the Ramessid dynasties is also seen in monuments such as the statue in the Egyptian fl.1useurn in Cairo ,vhich depicts the crouching god overshadowing and protecting a king in exactly the same manner in which other tnonarchs were portrayed beneath the figure of the Horus falcon. The seated Seth animal appeared on the standard of the 11th Upper Egyptian nome -in \ater times impaled vvith a knife to counteract any potential harmfulness of the image. There are also scenes showing the sun god's barque being to\ved by Seth animals instead of the customary jackals. As time progressed Seth was also represented in semi-anthropo1norphic form as a man \Vith the head of the Seth animal, and this form of his iconography is particularly common in Nev" Kingdom times. Images and amulets of the god son1etin1es sho\v him wearing the \i\fhite Crown of Upper Egypt, or the



Double Crownof all Egypt which he claimed as his O\VO. He may also be shovvn fused with Horus as a !\Vo-headed deity - symbolically binding the rulership of Upper and Lo\.ver Egypt. In the later periods sculptural representations of the god in this aspect \Vere often changed into the form of more acceptable deities such as Thoth. Yet in some areas where his worship persisted the image of Seth was utilized until relatively late times.In the temple of Hibis in the el-Kharga Oasis the god is represented as a winged figure slaying theserpent Apophis, a depiction \Vhich son1e scholars believe may have provided the original inspiration for the Christian motif of St. George and the dragon. In addition to the Seth creature iftse!f, a number of animals such as the antelope, ass or donkey, goat, pig, hippopotamus, crocodile, and certain fish ,,vere all regarded as symbolically noxious by the ancient Egyptians, so the god Seth could also be represented in the guise of any of these abhorred creatures. So1neti1nessuch animals are used as visual circumlocutions for the god, just as in written texts he is often referred to indirectly as 'Son of >Jut' rather than by name. In the first milleniwn BC, in fact, the Seth animal disappeared from art and writing, and the god was most freq uently depicted a.s an ass with a knife in its head to render it harmless.
Worship
Despite the odious character of Seth, the god received considerable veneration in the course of Egyptian history. Even apart from those periods in \Vhich he \,vas elevated to a special position, Seth had cult centres in various areas and particularly in o·pper Egypt where he \Vas often regarded as a patron deity of the region, symbolically balancing Horus in Lo\ver Egypt. The earliest cult centre of the god was perhaps at ancient Nubt, the Greek Ombos, son1e 30 km (19 miles) north of LLL"<Or, at the entrance to the Wadi Han1mamat ,vhich controlled trade to the eastern desert regions, and it ,vas in this area that Seth was said to have been born. He \vas particularly venerated in the 5th, 10th, 11th and 19th Upper Egyptian nomes, but Seth was also venerated in Lo\.ver Egypt, however, and especially in the area of the 14th nome which lay on Egypt's northeastern frontier. A cult centre of the god also existed in the royal city of Pi-Ramesses in the Delta. Although not an aspect of the veneration of the god, the sacrifice or destruction of various Sethian animals was part of the religious activity which surrounded him. From early times a red ox representing Seth \Vas sacrificially slaughtered, and a 3irnilar ritual of 'strangling the desert bird' is also knov.rn. Perhaps the most important rituals of this :ype involved the hippopotamus, and as early as the lsr dynasty there is evidence for the royal hippopotamus hunt in \vhich, in its developed forn1, the king hunted and destroyed a wild hippopotamus as a syn1bol of the victory of Horus over Seth. The des.truction of the hippopotamus became especially
important in the later periods when widespread veneration of Seth had virtually ended. Amulets of the god are not con1mon, though some v.rhich are extant are finely made and were
probably \,Vorn in life. Seth was frequently invoked or mentioned in magical spells, however, \Vhere his power vvas utilized against other inimical deities or against conditions \.vhich were relevant to the god's o\vn mythology. Overall, ho\.vever, for many Egyptians - over much of Egypt's history - Seth seems to have remained an a1nbivalent deity at best. Wax models were made of the god and then thoroughly destroyed in order to combat his influence, and in the Egyptian calendar the birthday of Seth was regarded as a particularly unlucky day.

Wenet
Wenet was the patron goddess of the area of vVenu - later Hermopolis Magna - and the surrounding 15th Upper Egyptian nome. Known as 'the swift one', her sacred animal was the desert hare and the goddess was depicted as a hare, as a \voman with a standard bearing a recumbent hare on her head, or even ~Nith a human body and the head of a hare. According to Plutarch the Egyptians venerated the hare on account of its S\.viftness and keen senses, but the anin1al's form 1,,vas also taken by certain underworld deities and at the same time vVenet was sometimes depicted in the form of a snake, a creature \.vith clear chthonic associations. Amulets made in the shape of the hare n1ay have related to some aspect of the creature's nature or may have been symbolic of this goddess. Wenet's male counterpart, Wenenu, ,vas sometimes identified as a form of Osiris or Re.

FA LCON DE ITI ES
From the very earliest times the falcon seems to have been worshipped in Egypt as representative of the greatest cosmic powers. According to this view, the eyes of the soaring bi.rd \Vere the sun and the 010011 and the speckled feathers of its underside \1/ere perhaps seen as the stars. JVIany falcon gods existed throughout Egypt, however, and only as time progressed were a good number of these assimilated to Horus, the most import.ant of the group. The falcon also became important as a symbol of the king and as a god of kingship from early dynastic times.
Dunanwi
Mythology
Dunanwi (Egyptian for 'he who stretches out the claws'), god of the 18th Upper Egyptian nome, may bave originally been a divinity in feline or other form, but was certainly known in the aspect of the falcon for 1nost of Egyptian history. In the Pyramid 'fexts Dunanv,;i appears in several contexts, including that of the purification ritual in which the god represents the east in accompanying Thoth, Horus and Seth who together personify the four cardinal points {PT 27, etc.). Fro1n the end of the Old Kingdorn, however, Dunanvvi seems to have been
assimilated with the falconiforrn god Nemty and is known only in that form thereafter. The falcon god Dunawi - 'he who stretches out the arms [wings]' mentioned in the Coffin Texts {CT VI 126) appears to be a later form of the same god. Like most other local falcon gods, Dunanwi was also assimilated to Horus and, because his name was adjacent to that of Anubis {the 17th Upper Egyptian name), he appears in the Late Period as the combined Horus-Anubis.
Iconography
As depicted on the standard of his nome, the falcon god stands atop the standard's pole, often with 1.ivings outstretched. In some representations the bird's ov1n wings are clearly extended, wh ile in others the falcon appears to have a second set of wings which are stretched in add ition to those folded over its back.
Worship
The repeated mention of Dunanwi in the Pyramid Texts rr1ight indicate at least a fairly wide level of recognition of the god in early times, but after his assimilation with Nemty and eventually with Horus, his veneration vvas mainly limited to that of a local god of his own nome.
Horus
Mythology
Horus vvas one of the earliest of Egyptian deities. His name is attested from the beginning of the Dynastic Period and it is probable that early falcon deities such as that shown restraining the 'marsh dwellers' on the Narmer Palette represent this same god. The Turin Canon, which provides some of our most important information on Egypt's early history, specifically describes the Predynastic rulers of Egypt as 'Follo,vers of Horus'. But Horus appears in many forms and his mythology isoneof the most extensive of all Egypt's deities. T he following represent only the god's most significant aspects - and each subsumes a number of forms of the deity.
Sky god: This is the original form of Horus as 'lord of the sky' which preceded all others. The Egyptian word her from which the god's name is derived means 'the one on high' or 'the distant one' in reference to the soarin.g flight of the hunting falcon (if not a reference to the solar aspect of the god). Mythologically, the god was imagined as a celestial falcon whose right eye was the sun and left eye the moon. T he speckled feathers of his breast were probab)y the stars and his ,vings the sky - vvith their dovvnsweep producing the winds. It ,vas in this form that Horus was apparently worshipped at some of Egypt's earliest sites such as Hierakonpolis and in vvhich Horus assimilated a number of other localfalcon gods.

Sun god: As a natural outgrowth of his role as cosmic sky god Horus was also venerated more specifically as a solar god. An ivory comb of the 1stdynasty king Den depicts a falcon in a boat riding on outstretched \vings suggesting the falcon tra\·ersing the sky as the sun god. The Pyramid Texts 3pecifically refer to Horus in solar tern1s as 'god of the east' and he appeared in at least three forms in this guise. As Horakhty or 'Horus of the two horizons' Horus \vas the god of the rising and setting sun, but more particularly the god of the east and the sunrise, and in the Pyramid Texts the deceased king is said to be reborn in the eastern sky as Horakhty (PT 4). Eventually, Horakhty was drawn into the sun cult of Heliopolis and fused with :ts solar god as Re-Horakhty. As Behdety or 'he of ) he] behdet', Horus ,:vas the ha\vk-winged sun disk ,vhich seems to incorporate the idea of the passage '.)f the sun through the sky. As Hor-em-akhet 1Harmachis) or 'Horus in the horizon', Horus \Vas \·isualized as a sun god in falcon or leonine :orm. By Ne,v Kingdon1 tin1es, the Great Sphinx of Giza - originally a representation of the 4th-dynasty king Khafre - ,.vas interpreted as an image of Hor-em-akhet.
Son of Isis: Horus also came to be \vorshipped as ~he son of Osiris and the goddess Isis (see Male ~hdd Deities), though either this god was originally a .separate deity ,vith whom the ancient falcon god ,\·as fused, or the falcon deity ,vas incorporated into
the Osirian family in very different form - as a divine infant.
God of mngship: Horus was directly linked with the kingship of Egypt in both his falconiform aspect
and as son of Isis. From the earliest Dynastic Period the king's name was \.vritten in the rectangular device kno\.vn as the serekh \vhich depicted the Horus falcon perched on a stylized palace enclosure and ,vhich seems to indicate the king as med iator bet\veen the heavenly and earthly realms, if not the god manifest \vithin the palace as the king himself. To this 'Horus name' of the monarch other titles were later added, including the 'Golden Horus' name in which a divine falcon is depicted upon the hieroglyphic sign for gold, though the significance of this title is less clear. The kingship imagery is found in the farnous statue of Khafre seated with the Horus falcon at the back of his head and in other similar examples. As the son of Isis and Osiris Horus was also the mythical heir to the kingship of Egypt, and many stories surrounding his struggle to gain and hold the kingship from the usurper Seth detail this aspect of the god's role. Harwer (Haroeris) 'Horus the Elder' \Vas the mature god represented in these stories \vho battles the typhon ic Seth for 80 years until the tribunalof the gods finally a\vards him his rightful place on the throne of all

Egypt. Finally, as Har-mau or Harsomptus, 'Horus the Un iter', Horus fulfills this role of uniting and ruling over Egypt, though he is sometimes identified as the son of Horus the Elder and Hathor in this role - as at Edfu and Korn Ombo - and called by the name Panebta\.vy 'Lord of the Two Lands'.
Iconography
In his original avian forn1 Horus was depicted as a falcon (probably the tanner - Fako biarniicus or peregrine - Fako peregrinus) sho\vn t\vodimensionally in profile except for the tail feathers \vhich were turned towards the vie\.ver according to the canons of Egyptian composite perspective. Early examples someti1nes sho'vv the falcon leaning forward in a lateral position but the upright stance became standard as time progressed. Sometimes the falcon is shown in direct association with the Seth animal or one of his symbols-especially in the Late Period - as in the nome sign of the 16th Upper Egyptian nome where the falcon is depicted with its
talons sunk into the back of an oryx - an ancient symbol of Seth. As the ha\~k-\vinged Behdety, the god became one of the most widespread images in Egyptian art, an image perhaps foreshado\.ved in the comb of Den (see above), and which became virtually ubiquitous as a rnotif used in the decoration of temple walls and stelae throughout Egypt. In the form of Horakhty he may appear as a falcon or even as a falcon-headed crocodile, and in fully anthropomorphic form Horus appears as an adult god or more usually as a child - the son of Isis. But it is in the combined zoo-anthropomorphic form of a falcon-headed man that the god most frequently appears, often wearing the Double Crown signifying his kingship over all Egypt.

Worship
Because Horus was worshipped in many forms and because he assimilated many other gods - it is difficult to summarize the sites associated with his \vorship effectively. It is clear, for example, that Horus \Vas associated \Vith the area of Nekhen in southern Egypt (the Greek Hierakonpolis or 'City of the Hawk') from very early times, and it seems likely



•
that the god v-1as in fact the falcon deity worshipped there since the predynastic period. But Horus \~as \.vorshipped along with other deit ies in many Egyptian temples, and important sites of his ,,vorship are known from one end of Egypt to the other. For example, in the north, the falcon god was particularly venerated in the Delta at the ancient site of Khem (the Greek Letopolis and modern Ausim) :;ince at least the beginning of the Old l(ingdom and ,vas known there as Horus Khenty-irty or I(hentykhem, 'Foremost One of Khem'. Chapter 112 of the Book of the Dead tells ho\.v the Delta city of Pe (the historical Buto) was given to Horus as compensarion for his eye v.rhich \vas injured by Seth, thus explaining this important centre of the god and the site of Behdet also became a centre of Horus wor_;;hip in the Delta. In southern Egypt Horus enjoyed the attentions of his o·wn cult along ,vith his consort Hathor and their son Harsornptus in the important Ptolemaic temples at Edfu and also at Korn Ombo. ;.\t Edfu, the god's many ceremonies included the annual Coronation of the Sacred Falcon at the beginning of the 5th month of the Egyptian year in \\·hich an actual falcon \.vas selected to represent the god as ki ng of all Egypt, thus uniting the ancient falcon god \vith his fonn as Horus son of Osiris and \,·ith the king. Further south, in Nubia, ,ve find temples to forms of the god at Quban (Horus of Baki), Buhen, and Aniba (Horus of l\tliam) as well as the inclusion of the god in many other monuments - as at J-\bu Simbel and elsewhere. J-\s the object of popular veneration throughout Egypt Horus ,vas often
represented by amulets depicting him either in the ·~orm of a falcon or as a falcon-headed man (in either case often vvearing the Double Crovvn). His \vide~pread veneration is also seen in the many healing
plaques or cippi \vhich aimed to utilize his power.
Khenty- irty
Khenty-irty vvas a falcon god of Khem or Letopolis modern Ausim), the capital of the second Lo\.ver Egyptian nome. Originally ,,.,orshipped as Khentykhem ('foremost of Khem'), the falcon god ,vas c:":entually assimilated by Horus during the Old Kingdom. The meaning of his name Khenty-irty has been explained in different ,vays but may mean ·sharp-eyed one'. Like Khenty-khety, this god's veneration was mainly localized around his cult centre.
Khenty-khety
The god Khenty-khety ,vas a local dei ty of the Lo\ver Egyptian area of Kem-wer or Athribis (modern Tell Atrib). In the Old Kingdom he 'Nas largely absorbed by Horus and as a result \.Vas frequently called Horus Khenty-khety. Also called Horus Kbenty-khai or Hor-merty, the god was usually
depicted as a falcon-headed 1nan, often holding two eyes representing the sun and moon, but he could also be depicted as a crocodile due to his early assimilation of the indigenous deity of that form. Although found beyond it, he \.Vas mainly venerated in his central cult area.
Mon tu
Mythology
Nlontu was the falcon-headed vvar god venerated in Thebes and its surrounding areas. Although he appears in the Pyramid Texts and in some archaeological contexts of Old K.ingdom date, it \Vas with the Theban rulers of the 11th dynasty that 1\tlontu rose to importance. Three rulers of this dynasty bore the birth name Montubotep or 'iVIontu is content', and the god became a deity of national standing \vorshipped in his own right and also associated \.Vith Horus under the na1ne 'Horus of the strong arm'. As the iVIiddle Kingdom progressed, 1\tlontu also began to be vievved as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Re of Heliopolis, due perhaps to the similarity of the name of his cult centre, Iuny, with that of Iunu or Heliopolis, and the t\VO deities v1ere worshipped as the combined Mont-Re. The god was thus later equated by the Greeks with i\pollo. During the 12th dynasty, hov.1ever, Nlontu's importance began to \vane as the god Amun rose to power in the Theban area. Nevertheless, the \.var god's popularity continued \Vith martially vigorous rulers of the Ne\v Kingdom such as Tuthmosis III and others who compared themselves to him as heroes \.vho fought 'like l\tlontu in his might'. Montu's consorts were the little-kno,vn Theban goddess Tjenenyet and the solar goddess Raettawy.

of the 18th-dynasty queen Ahhotep depicts Montu in the form of a ferocious \Vinged griffin, but this iconography was possibly influenced by Syrian sources, since most representations of the god shovJ him in semi-anthropomorphic form with a human body and the head of a falcon. Sometimes he carries
the curved khepesh sword as a syrnbol of his ,.varlike nature. Montu usually wears the sun disk and uraeus but is distinguished from Re and other falcon deities by the two tall plumes ,:vhich also adorn his head. When depicted in fully falcon form, the god is also identified by this headdress. Montu
could also be represented in the form of his sacred bull, the Buchis (see p. 172), or occasionally in the later dynasties as a bull-headed man.
Worship
The main cult centres of Montu vvere all in the Theban region and included four important temple sites: i\lledamud, \.I/here a sanctuary established by Senwosret III was expanded during the Ne,,v l(ingdom when it was linked to Thebes by a canal, and further expanded in the Graeco-Roman Period; Karnak, where Montu had his own temple precinct to the north of the Great Temple of Atnun; Armant, where the god's most important sanctuary - no longer in existence - 1,,vas located; and Tod , vvbere temples were built in the lvliddle Kingdom and also New Kingdom and Graeco-Roman times. It was in the Middle Kingdom te1nple at this last site that the rich 'Tod treasure' consisting of chests of ite1ns dedicated to f\1ontu was found in 1936. Amulets were made of the god in the later periods and so1netimes these took the form of four falcon-headed deities side by side - representing the 'four Montus' of the four Theban area sites.
Nemty
Mythology
The god Nernty (previously read as Anti) ,vas an ancient falcon deity (Egyptian 'wanderer') \vhose cult was assimilated from quite early times into that of the god Horus. Nen1ty may also be associated 1,,vith t1,,vo other falcon gods mentioned in the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts respectively: Dunanwi and Duna\.vi. The Coffin Texts characterize Nemty as supervising the henu boat of the falcon deity Sokar, and in later texts he appears as the ferryman \Vho transports Re and other gods. A late Egyptian myth preserved in the Ptolemaic Period Papyrus Jumilhac relates how the head of the cow goddess Hathor was cut off by Nemty - an act reminiscent of that perpetrated by Horus against Isis in the 'Contendings of I-Iorus and Seth'. Nemty was flayed of his skin and flesh for this crime, \vhich appears to be an etiological story explain1ng vvhy the \vorshippers of Ne111ty in the 12th Upper Egyptian nome constructed their cult image of silver - the metal associated 1,vith the bones of the gods - rather than the usual gold of which the flesh and skin of the gods ,vas said to be formed.
Iconography
Nemty is usually depicted as a falcon squatting on a curved, stylized boat 1,,vhich resembles a lunar crescent or even a throw stick in its simplicity. On the standard of the 18th Upper Egyptian nome,however, the boat does not appear; and in the form of Dunan,,vi, the god stands atop the standard's pole

The sun god Re was arguably Egypt's rnost important deity, Though possibly not as old as the falcon god Horus, Re 1.,vas an ancient deity who coalesced with many other solar and cosmic gods through time while retaining his O\.vn position. At an early date he seen1s to have merged \.Vith the falcon god becon1ing Re-Horakhty as the morning sun. and \.Vith An.1m as the evening sun. In the Book of the

Dead we actually find Re fused vvith these and other deities as the composite Re-Horakhty-Atun1-HorusKhepri. Even vvhen the god Amun rose to national supremacy in the Middle and Ne\v Kingdon1s, Re was not suppressed and the two deities were brought together as Amun-Re in a process of syncretism \vhich led to the association of most of Egypt's major gods \vith the powerful solar deity. Re ,.vas a universal deity vvho acted within the heavens, earth and underworld. In addition, the god was a prime element in most Egyptian creation myths and also acted as divine father and protector of the king. The extensive n1ythology pertaining to the god rnay perhaps best be understood in terms of these five roles.
Re in the heavens: According to Egyptian myth, when Re became too old and weary to reign on earth the god Nun ordered Nu t to turn herself into a cow and to raise the god up on her back. \.Vhen the goddess lifted Re high above the earth, she became the sky and Re became king of the heavens. The na1ne Re is simply the Egyptian word for the sun and while the blazing solar orb was considered to be the visible body of Re, it \.Vas also seen as his independent 'Eye' (giving rise to expressions such as 'Re in the midst of his Eye', though the 'Eye' could also be a fierce manifestation of one of a number of goddesses) and as the vessel of his daily journey. According to this latter vie'-'v, the solar god daily navigated the great celestial ocean in his mandjetor 'day barque' which crossed the sky fron1 sunrise to sunset. He was said to be accompanied in this voyage by his daughter, Maat, and by various other deities. From the time of the Pyramid Texts ,ve also find descriptions of the monarch ascending to the sky to join the entourage of the sun god. An i1nportant mythological aspect of the solar god in the heavens is found in his identity as a cosmic lion as seen in Chapter 62 of the Book of the Dead, for example, which states that 'I am he who crosses the sky, I am the lion of Re... '.The stellar constellation now known as Leo was also recognized by the Egyptians as being in the form of a recumbent lion, and as its bright shoulder star, Regulus, travels through the night sky along the ecliptic - the apparent path of the sun in the daytime sky - the constellation was directly associated ,~ith the sun god.
Re on earth: As Egyptian mythology tells how Re ruled on earth in the earliest ages there are also ample indications that the Egyptians recognized the sun's influence in the physical world. Akhenaten's celebrated Great Hy1nn to the Aten, for example, vvhile directed to his own chosen solar manifes tation, nevertheless speaks to the power of the sun in providing light and heat, causing crops to grow, etc. Normal\y this power of the sun on the earth was ascribed to Re, as may be seen in many
scattered references in hymns and other texts honouring the sun god for the manifestations of his
po\ver on earth. A specific and important example of Re's influence on the earth is seen in that the god was said to direct the three seasons of the Egyptian year-thus influencing the annual inundation of the Nile and the subsequent growing and harvest seasons. Re's power on earth was also expressed in the role and position of the n1onarch according to Egyptian kingship ideology and in various other ,.vays.Sacred books kept in the temple scriptoria or 'Houses of Life' were said to be emanations of Re, for example; and as the head of the divine tribunal Re decided many cases which affected life on earth.
Rein the netherworld: Justas Re travelled thesky in his day barque, at dusk he entered the underworld in the n1esketet or 'evening barque', travelling through the nether regions (often depicted in his rain -headed form as the 'flesh of Re>) before being reborn the follo,ving da,vn. The funerary texts which ,vere inscribed on the \1/alls of the tombs of the Valley of the Kings depict this unden:vorld journey and also the manner in ,:vhich Re interacts \Vith the undenvorld god Osiris during this tiine. The texts shovv a complex and evolving relationship between the t,vo gods which ends \1/ith a kind of fusion in which Osiris is seen as the corpse or 'body' of the dual god and Re is the ba or 'soul', so that the combined Re-Osiris might be said to both ascend to the heavens as a ba in the day and be joined with his body in the earth at night. There are co1nplex variations on this then1e, ho,vever, and in the text knov,rn as the L,tany of Re the sun god is said to visit multiple forms of himself in the undervvorld (74 are depicted in the tomb of Tuthmosis III, for example).



The sun god himself is also regenerated in the nightly cycle, but before this triumphal occurrence, the serpent Apophis, arch enemy of Re, is defeated each night with the aid of those deities that accompany Re in his barque. Just as the deceased king \vas said to ascend to the heavens to join Re's journey a.cross the sky, so he also accompanied the solar god on his underworld journey.
Rr as creator: According to the cosmogonic ideas developed in Heliopolis and at other sites, the sun
god Re was the supreme creator who emerged from the primeval waters at the beginning of time to create every aspect of the world. There were many ·:ersions of this myth, and the solar demiurge was envisaged as coming into being upon a mound or a lotus flovv-er rising from the waters in the form of a child, or a heron, falcon,scarab beetle or other crea

In one story involving a play on \vords Re created man (re1net1) from his tears (remut) which fell to the earth, ,.vhile in another, the sun god 'cut' his o,vn phallus (possibly meaning circumcision) and the t1ivo deities Hu ('authority') and Sia ('mind') are said to have sprung from the drops of blood which fell to earth. In all versions of the story, hovvever, it was the sun god v1ho created other deities and human beings, and in this guise Re was called both 'father' and 'mother' of all living things.
Re as king and father of the king: In Egyptian mythology the creation of kingship and social order was synchronous with the creation of the world. Re 1ivas thus the first king as well as the creator of

kingship. The god ruled on earth over his creation until according to legend he became old, then Re departed to the heavens \vhere he continued to rule and also acted as the ancestor of the king of Egypt. In the Pyramid Texts ·we find the combined Re
Atum called the father of the king, and according to the legend preserved in the \Vestcar Papyrus. the
kings of the 5th dynasty vvere actual sons of Re divinely begotten on the wife of the high priest of Heliopolis. Already by the 5th dynasty, the 'Son of Re' epithet of the king's titulary had been introduced \vhich formalized this mythical relationship for the rest of Egyptian history. Rulership under Re was synonymous ,,vith right rulership or rule according to maat, and 'vve find inscriptions of the opposite which are historical condernnations - as \Vhen Ha.tshepsut recorded of the foreign Hyksos rulers that they were kings \vithout Re'.
Iconography
Re \vas represented in many forms. The god could be depicted as the fiery disk of the sun, usually encircled by a protective cobra, and often given outstretched wings. Occasionally prior to the Amarna Period and in that time the solar disk was depicted with outstretched rays. While not usually represented

in fully anthropomorphic form, Re vvas commonly depicted semi-anthropomorphically as a ,nan -.vith the head of a falcon, a ram or a scarab. Re was also represented in zoomorphic form as a falcon wearing the sun disk upon its bead. Under the guise of his various manifestations he could also be represented as a ram or scarab beetle, a phoenix, heron, serpent, bull, cat, lion and other

creatures. The combination of the beetle, solar disk and ram-headed 1nan into one composite image was particularly common in representing Re in his morning, noon and evening forms. Re was also sometimes depicted fused \.vith other deities as a composite god, though in the case of Amun-Re the iconography is essentially that of Amun alone (see p. 92), apart from the addition of a small solar disk to the god's cro\vn. Clearer fusion is seen in representations of the combined Re-Osiris where, as 'Re resting in Osiris' and 'Osiris resting in Re', the god is often depicted as a mummiforrn figure (Osiris) vvith the head of a ram (Re in his night-time aspect), though Re may also be represented in this combination by the head of a falcon or scarab. Although by at least the 5th dynasty Raet or Raettavvy, a female counterpart to Re, had been assigned to the sun god, he is usually depicted \<vithout a consort in his representations. A number of solar-related images and iconographic devices 1,,vere also used to signify Re in various contexts. In the New Kingdom royal tombs carved in the \!alley of the Kings, elements such as sun disks, flying vultures, and yellow bands painted on the ceilings and tops of the walls of tomb passages are all used to de.fine the path of the sun's journey through the underworld as represented by the tomb. Royal cartouches - \vhich were themselves solar related in origin - were also sometimes utilized alongside purely solar sy1nbols to signify the fusion of the deceased king with the sun god on this nether,vorld journey. Winged solar disks and other sun symbols placed under lintels and along orocessional routes were utilized in a similar
•manner in depicting the sun's symbolic passsage through many Egyptian temples. Solar symbols could also be architectural in nature. The for1ns of the pyramid, ben-ben, staircase, mound and obelisk v.iere all solar-related symbols utilized in Egyptian religious iconography that were based on concrete architectural analogues. In fact, taken together, the \·arious solar symbols are the most prevalent ele;nents utilized in Egyptian iconography and they are found in a wider range of contexts than any Jther divine syn1bols.
Worship
The cult of Re is first attested in the narne of the 2nd-dynasty ruler, Raneb, and during the 4th dynasty \-VOrship of the god evidently reached a peak with kings taking the epithet 'Son of Re' frotn :he time of Khafre, and the pyramids and their associated temples being unequivocally linked to Re in ;arious ways. By the 5th dynasty Re had become, in .-ssence, Egypt's state god, officially recognized as he head of the pantheon. Doubtless a great temple ~ Re vvas constructed at this time in Heliopolis, !-tough remains of this structure have never been ."nund. But in the 5th dynasty several kings built --un temples "vith large masonry obelisks in the
region of their own pyramids and mortuary temples, and these solar-oriented structures may ,veil have been modelled after the Heliopolitan cult centre and its ben-ben (seep. 212). \7\f hile Re's cult was centred at Heliopolis, he \Vas \Vorshipped universally throughout Egypt; and although there \<vere definite high points in the importance of solar religion, Re was venerated in every age of the country's long dynastic history. Sanctuaries \Vere constantly constructed or renevved for him, and he ,vas included in many of the temples of other deities throughout the remainder of dynastic history. The god certainly enjoyed a kind of renaissance in the New Kingdom, beginning in the reign of Amenophis III, who constructed a number of great solar temples and courts. This reign directly preceded the ultimately aborted efforts of Akhenaten to establish the sun god, in his form of the Aten, as sole god. Despite the repudiated doctrines of the Amarna Period, solar religion continued to be of great importance during Ramessid times •Nhen Re was frequently honoured by his epony1nous kings. Re also has a strong presence in New I(ingdom religious literature - especially in funerary texts vvhich successfully balanced the position of the sun god ,vith that of Osiris. In the later periods of Egyptian history the position of the sun god is overshado\ved to a large degree by other deities, yet Re remained important, and even after the close of the dynastic age, in Christian times, we find occasional texts appealing to Jesus, the Holy Spirit and the sun god lte. Although the cult of Re was always of primary importance to the Egyptian king and in officially sponsored religion, the god was not without popular appeal and veneration. His importance is seen in non-royal as "'vell as royal names incorporating the name of Re, and the god \Vas represented in amulets. Many of these \vere made to be worn in life as a mark of veneration, in addition to the images of the god which accompanied the deceased in the funerary assemblage. Re also appears in various magical spells including those which n1ake an ultimate threat-to stop the course of the sun in its journey. Such spells were usually aimed at attempting to cause the sun god to right some vvrong and to restore balance in his creation.
Sokar
Mythology
An ancient falcon god of the l\llen1phite region, Sokar was perhaps originally a god of craftsmanship who became associated rvith the necropoleis of that area and rose, in time, to considerable importance as a chthonic and afterlife deity. He is frequently mentioned in the Pyramid Texts in the afterlife context where the deceased king is said to be raised into the 'henu barque' of Sokar and equated

with the god (PT 620, 1824, 2240, etc.). Sokar is also given many epithets such as 'he of Rosetau' (the necropolis entrance into the underworld), but the meaning of the god's name is uncertain, and while the Pyra1nid Texts seem to explain it as being based on the vvords of an anguished cry of Osiris (PT 1256), this is clearly based on an association of Sokar with Osiris vvhich occurred only after the latter god's rise to importance. Even before his association with Osiris, Sokar had became linked
with the i\llemphite god Ptah as the combined PtahSokar and also by taking Ptah's consort Sekhmet as
his own. By i\t!iddle Kingdo1n tin1es all three of these gods had been combined into the tripartite deity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris vvho remained an important funerary deity for most of the remainder of Egypt's dynastic history.
Iconography
Sokar could be depicted in various ,vays in addition to that of the falcon which \:vas his original form. In the more sy1nbolic forms he is represented by an earthen funerary mound sur1nounted by a falcon's head \,vhich is sometimes set in a boat, an image depicted in vignettes of the Amdual vvhere Sokar is called 'he ,vho is upon his sand'. As a falcon-headed man Sokar is often represented as n1ummiform and sometimes wears a complex conical crovvn vvith sun disk horns and cobras. In the tomb of Tuthmosis III in the Valley of the Kings he is depicted as a falconheaded god standing on a multi-headed chthonic serpent, emphasizing his power over the nether regions and their inhabitants. The most impressive surviving exan1ple of this falcon-headed type of the god's·iconography is found in the silver coffin of Sheshonq II found at 'fanis. In later tin1es his mosr common representation is in the form of PtahSokar-Osiris, and frorn the Late Period onwards small statues of the con1bined deity were made \:vhich shovv him as a mummiform human-headed god standing upright on a sarcophagus-like box or pedestal, often surmounted by Sokar's falcon-head image. Ptah-Sokar-Osiris could also be represented as a squat, pygmy-like male, sometimes \-Vith a scarab beetle on his head, and the amuletic deity Pataikos appears to have been derived from these particular Ptah-Sokar-Osiris figures.
Worship
i\llemphis was the cult centre of Sokar and it \.vas there, at least by early Old Kingdom times, that the great Sokar festival took place each year in the fourth month of the spring al,lwt season. During this the god \.vas carried from his temple to assist
the king in ceremonial activities including hoeing of the earth or the digging of ditches or canals. From Nevv I(ingdom times the Sokar festiva l vvas also celebrated with great ceremony in vvestern Thebes ,vhere it is depicted in reliefs in the temp le of Ramesses Ill at lvledinet l-labu.

Amulets of Sokar are not common, but some depicting squatting, mummi:ormfalcons may represent the god.
Sopdu
Mythology
The mythology of Sopdu is complex and presents ,\·o very different aspects of this god - he is both a ..:osmic falcon god sin1ilar to Horus and also, in anrhropomorphic form, as a god of Egypt's eastern 'rontier. In the Pyramid Texts, the ash·al nature of he deity is stressed. The deceased king, in his role ~ Osiris-Orion, is said to impregnate Isis as the star
Sothis and to produce Horus-Sopdu. Sopdu is also equated ,vith the teeth of the deified king, apparently as an allusion to the curved beak of the god who is said to be 'sharp of teeth' (PT 201). On the other hand, Sopdu also gained significance as 'lord of the east' who protected Egyptianoutposts in the border regions such as the turquoise tnines of the Sinai Peninsula. The god thus appears in royal inscriptions 1,,vhere he is said to provide the various resources of the east and to be a helper of the pharaoh in controlling the native populations. As god of the Asiatic regions Sopdu ,vas himself often asso
ciated vvith Near Eastern deities ,:i,.rho were assimilated into Egyptian religion such as Baal, Reshep, Astarte, Anat and Qadesh.
Iconography
In his zoomorphicform Sopdu was depicted as a falcon crouching on a standard v.1ith tvvo tall plumes on its head and a ritual flail held over its shoulder. This is the symbol of the Lovier Egyptian nome over which the god presided, but it is found in a number of representations of the god including a fine example of gilded wood from the tomb of Tutankhamun. In anthropomorphic form, as god of the eastern desert regions, Sopdu appears as a Bedouin warrior with long hair and a pointed beard. He wears a cro\vn of tvvo tall feathers and a tasselled or beaded she1nset girdle, the Egyptian narne of vvhich is perhaps related to the mineral malachite. Sopdu n1ay carry a spear or tall u1as sceptre in
one hand and an axe and ankh sign in the other.
Worship
As the god of the 20th Lower Egyptian nome, Sopdu's main cult centre vvas at Per Sopdu (the modern Saft el-Henna) in the eastern Delta. Hovvever, priests of the god are attested at a number of Egyptian sites from Old I<ingdom times and he was also venerated in many eastern desert outposts such as the site of Serabit el-Khadi1n in the Sinai Peninsula where he \Vas worshipped along ,vith Hathor and certain other deities.

OTHER AVIAN DEITIES
It is not clear \.Vhy some avian species came to represent deities in the Egyptian pantheon and others did not, and among those birds that did receive veneration there are few common characteristics. The heron, goose, vulture and ibis were the most important of these species, though other birds p1ayed occasional roles in Egyptian mythology.
Benu
Mythology
The word be·nu is related to the verb iveben 'to rise' as \veil as to the ben-ben - the upthrust sacred stone of Heliopolis. The Benu bird vvas an important avian deity, originally of solar connections, which came to represent three major gods: Atum, Re and Osiris. As an aspect of Atum, the Benu bird was said to have flown over the waters of Nun before the original creation. According to this view, the bird finally came to rest on a rock at \.Vhich point its cry broke the primeval silence and was said to have
deterrnined \~hat was and "vhat was not to be in the unfolding creation. The Benu was also said to be the ba of Re, and by the Late Period the hieroglyphic sign depicting the bird \.Vas used to write the name of the chief sun god. Believed to constantly rise anew like the sun, the Benu bird was called the 'lord of jubilees' \Vhich doubtless led to the
conception of its long life and to it becoming the prototype for the Greek phoenix which renevved itself in a fiery death like the sun rising at dawn. According to Herodotus the bird lived for 500 years before it fashioned a nest of aromatic boughs and spices which it set it on fire to be consumed in the flames. From the conflagration a new phoenix miraculously arose, which after embahning its father's ashes flew with them to Heliopolis where it deposited the ashes on the altar of the temple of Re. Although the bird was associated primarily \vith Atum and Re, its connection \Vith rebirth also led to an association with Osiris.
Iconography
The bird which first served as a symbol of solar deities in Heliopolis was probably the yellow wagtail (Motacilla fiava) vvhich, according to the Pyramid Texts (PT 1652), represented Atum himself. By New Kingdom times, however, the Benu was usually depicted as a grey heron (Ardea cinera), with long legs and beak and its head adorned with a two-feathered crest. UsuaHy the Benu is depicted atop a stylized ben-ben stone as a symbol of the great solar god, but its association ,vith Osiris meant that it was also sometimes depicted in the
sacred \.Villow of that god. The bird was also represented wearing the Atef Crown in its role as a syn1bol of Osiris. According to the Classical vision of the phoenix, the bird was said to be as large as an eagle, \.Vith red and gold (solar or flame-coloured) plumage. Benu could also be depicted in hybrid form as a heron-headed man.
Worship
Little is knov.1n of the formal veneration of the Benu, though its central association with the solar mythology of Heliopolis doubtless formed the basis for an irnportant role in the cults of that area. T he frequent depiction of the Benu bird in the vignettes of the 'afterlife books' as well as on heart amulets (such as that of Tutankharnun) and other objects also shovvs the persistence of the god's in1portance in funerary contexts.



Gengen-Wer
Mythology
A primeval goose representing certain gods in their creative aspects, Gengen-Wer man ifested the pov.1er of creation through his honking call or through carrying the eggfrom vvhich life emerged. The god's name is based on the goose's characteristically raucous cal\ or cackle (the onomatopoeic Egyptian ,vordgengen means 'honker' and iver1neans 'great'), and he \vas also called by the name negeg or ·cackler'. According to some texts it ,vas the honking call of Amun in the form of this god that ·a,voke' the creation (e.g., Papyrus Leiden I 350, Chapter 90). The goose was also closely associated 1.vith the earth god Geb ,vho \Vas himself sometimes called the 'great cackler' and ,vho, in this form, v.1as credited with having laid the first egg from vvhich the sun emerged as the Benu bird. The goose was
also a symbol of certain other deities including Hapy and Harpokrates. According to the complex ~nteraction of Egyptian creation mythology and afterlife beliefs Gengen-Wer is also found in descrip:ions of the netherworld in which the deceased is sometimes said to guard or even to be the god's egg. From the time of the Pyramid 1'exts the deceased aspired to fly to the heavens as a goose, and models 'lf the bird in Nevv Kingdom tombs are believed to represent this desire.
Iconography
;·arious species of geese appear in Egyptian art .'.lcluding the Nile goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) _nd others which could represent Gengen-Wer. 3ecause the goose was also used to represent ·\Inun, its image was desecrated by the agents of
; khenaten during the Amarna Period - as in the _otanical roo1n of Tuthmosis III in Karnak Temple
,!"Jere the representation of this avian species was .:Cfaced.

Nevertheless, although : \videly venerated directly, the goose was vvor.ipped in certain localities, and a flock of sacred .-es,e \Vas kept on the temple lake in Amun's Great C'!!lple at Karnak.
Henet
Henet vvas a pelican deity knov,,rn frorn Old Kingdom times and venerated as a beneficial goddess. In the Pyramid Texts, for unknown reasons, she is called 'mother of the king' (PT 511), and in the later funerary texts she is said to prophesy a safe passage for the deceased through the nethenvorld. Henet a\so had a directly protective function apparently related to the pelican's ability to scoop up fish and other creatures regarded as mythologically hostile or inimical, in a manner parallel to the symbolic representations found in Egyptian tombs of the snaring and netting of those same creatures.
Nekhbet
Mythology
The vulture goddess Nekhbet 'she of Nekheb' was the chief deity of ancient Nekheb (the modern elKab some 80 km south of LtLxor) which \Vas the capital of the 3rd nome of Upper Egypt. The significance of the site lay in its close proximity to the town of Nekhen (the Greek Hierakonpolis and rnodern I(om el-Ahmar) which vvas an early capital of all Upper Egypt, so tha t the goddess \Vas eventually adopted alongside the cobra goddess \~ladjet of

Buto in the Delta region as one of the t\V0 tutelary deities of the united Egypt. From at least Old Kingdom times Nekhbet \Vas identified vvith the vVhite Crown of Upper Egypt and thus became closely connected "vith the person of the king. ln this role Nekhbet "vas also a mythical mother of the king. The Pyramid Texts depict her as a mother goddess in the form of a great white co,v, and in royal birth scenes such as that in the mortuary temple of Sahure at Abusir Nekhbet is present as a protective nurse of the king. The Greeks thus equated Nekhbet with their goddess of childbirth. Eileithya, and called her city Nekheb Eileithyiaspolis. The Egyptians also sometimesequated or associated Nekhbet with Hathor.
Iconography
From her earliest appearances Nekhbet is often represented as a vulture (the Sociable Vulture. Vultur auricula.ris, "vhich is still common in Upper Egypt) either standing in profile vie\V, or with ,vings out stretched in direct viev1, \.vith only head and legs in profile. Often the Nekhbet vulture is depicted holding the circular shen or 'eternity' hieroglyph in her claws, though this is an iconographic elen1ent asso
ciated \.Vith a number of deities. Assin1ilation with her northern counterpart led to Nekhbet occasionally being depicted as a serpent Gust as Wadjet 1nay sometimes be sho\.vn in vulture form), though this fusing of the imagery of the two deities was usually for heraldic, decorative purposes and to stress their association rather than for mythological reasons. In serpent form Nekhbet usually 1.vears the 'vVhite Crown in order to maintain her identity. Egyptian rnonarchical symbolism utilized the image of the Nekhbet vulture in the nebty or 't,vo ladies' narne of the royal titulary in whtch the goddesses of Upper and Lovier Egypt were sho\.vn as vulture and cobra standing on woven baskets, and the two goddesses \.vere also depicted as personifications of the crowns of the Two Lands. In anthropomorphic form Nekhbet was usually represented as a woman "vearing a vulture cap, though she could also be shown ,vearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt.
Worship
Nekhbet possessed an impressively large sanctuary at el-Kab, though little has survived of th1s cult centre. Most of the present ruins there date to the later Dynastic Period, and only traces remain of New

Kingdom and Middle l{ingdorn structures. Nothing has been found of the shrines v-1hich undoubtedly stood at this site in very early times. The importance of Nekhbet in what might be called royal religion is seen in the many times she appears in a protective role alongside the pharaoh and in jewelry such as the exquisite vulture pendants found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. In the popular religion of the New Kingdom and Late Period Nekhbet \:vas also venerated as a protectress and as a goddess of childbirth.
Thoth
Mythology
The god Thoth. or Djehuty as he ,vas called by the Egyptians. was originally a moon god who eventually came to be associated vvith vvriting and knov-1ledge and to preside over scribes and scholars of all types. The god appeared in hvo distinct manifestations. as an ibis and as a baboon, and though both were lunar-related, that of the ibis vvas primary. His standard, or that of the ibis that later represented him, appears on slate palettes of the Predynastic Period, and Thoth vvas clearly already
an i111portant deity in Old Kingdom times when he is mentioned frequently in the Pyramid Texts. There, along vvith the sun god Re, he is one of the
't\.vo cornpanions' \Vhich cross the sky (P'T 128) and the gods are said to travel on the \ving· of Thoth across the \vinding vvaterway' or 'river' of the heavens (PT 594-96). During the Old Kingdom Thoth was also incorporated into the prevailing solar theology along with Osi.ris \vhom he is said to protect and serve - both directly and in the person of the deceased king vvho became one with Osiris. Although he is called the son of Re, the legends pertaining to Thoth repeatedly reflect this linkage with the myths of Osiris and his associated gods. The legend preserved in the 'Contendings of Horus and Seth' asserts that Thoth \.Vas the son of Horus and that he en1erged fron1 the forehead of Seth \.Vho had eaten the semen of Horus on some lettuce plants. A later version of the san1e legend has the seed of Horus appear on the head of Seth as a shining disk \vhich Thoth took and placed on his O\Vn head as his emblern. I-le \.Vas said to heal the injured eye of Horus vvhich ,vas associated with the l\lloon, and he often acted as a messenger. intercessor and conciliator bet\veen the gods.

216
Irr1portantly for his mythology Thoth was said to have invented the art of writing. He \.Vas thus the scribe of the Ennead who recorded 'the divine words' and was responsible for all kinds of accounts and records. As 'lord of ti1ne' and 'reckoner of years' he recorded the passing of time and assigned long reigns to kings. He vvas the patron of all areas of knowledge, and written treatises of all kinds fell under his care as lord of the 'houses of life' \¥hich functioned as scriptoria and libraries \vhich were attached to the temples. Not surprisingly then, Thoth commanded magic and secrets unknown to even the other gods, and his select followers were regarded as possessing special kno\vledge as is seen in a Middle Kingdom story called 'The iVIagician Djedi' set in the reign of King
Khufu. Thoth's record keeping also has afterlife associations, and in vignettes of the Book of the Dead he stands before the scales which 1.veigh the heart of the deceased and records the verdict. This role gave Thoth a reputation for truth and integrity and is seen in the common assertion that a person had conducted his \ife 1n a manner 'straight and true like Thoth'. Thoth's lunar identity rernained an important aspect of his personality. The god \vas also often placed in juxtaposition to the sun god Re as a kind of 'night sun', and in the Late Period he acquired the epithet 'silver Aten' . In the Hellenistic Period the Greeks equated him with their own god Hermes and, based on one of Thoth's epithets, specificaHy as Hennes trismegistos, or 'three times great'. The little known goddess Nehemetawy \Vas the consort of Thoth, though he is more often associated \Vith the goddess of writing, Seshat, who was variously depicted as his wife or daughter.
Iconography
Although there is considerable overlapping in the iconographic use of the two forms in which Thoth was manifest - the ibis and the baboon - there are also some differences worth noting. In his purely zoomorphic forms the baboon is somewhat more prevalent in representations than the ibis, though representations of the god as an ibis-headed man are most common of all. It is impossible to know, as is sometimes suggested, if the Egyptians sa\.v the shape of the baboon (Papio Cynocephalus) in the lunar disk in a manner similar to our 'man in the moon', but Thoth is depicted in baboon form in both lunar and scribal contexts. Unlike solar apes which are often depicted standing with their arms raised in adoration, Thoth as a baboon is usually shown as

a seated animal, heavily 1naned, resting on its rear \,Vith its legs dra1.vn up against its body and 'Nith its paws resting on its knees. Massive, 30-ton statues in this form were set up by Amenophis III at the main cult centre of Thoth at Hermopolis. Sometimes the god is depicted \vith the lunar disk and crescent on his head sy1nbolizing the n1oon's phases - either in statues stressing the god's role as lunar-deity or those stressing his role as patron of scribes. One fan1ous example shows the animal squatting on the shoulders of a scribe (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) and another, more con1mon type sho\vs the scribe seated before the baboon god who is raised on apedestal (Egyptian Museum, Cairo; Louvre, Paris; etc.). In the form of the sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus), whose distinctive white surrounded by black plumage and crescent-curved bill may have held syinbolic significance, Thoth was depicted in many statuettes which represent the god in general \vithout suggesting a specific lunar or scribal aspect. The ibis may be depicted standing or sitting, and a depiction of the bird perched on a standard ,vas the usual image used to write the god's name. In underworld scenes the god is usually depicted as either an ibis-headed man or as a baboon, and 3cenes sho,ving Thoth presiding over the judgment scales may depict him in either form. As an ibisheaded god Thoth also appears in many temple :SCenes ,vhere he may assist the gods or record matters of importance relating to the king. An i1nportant motif is that which shows him notching che palm branch which was ritually used for recording years in order to write down the great 1:urnber of years granted to the king as his reign. Sometimes, as in a scene in the hypostyle hall of he Great Teinple of Amun at Karnak, Thoth .akes the place of Seshat in writing the name of he king - here Ramesses II - on the leaves of the -,jcred persea tree. Thoth also appears in an "'"'1cient purification ritual accompanying Horus, "'c'th. and the falcon god Dunanwi who together -.ersonify the four cardinal points (P'l' 27). 1ften, hovvever, only Horus and Thoth are ..epicted in this scene, pouring ankh or life ,igns over the pharaoh from sacred water jars. ~- one peculiar form the ibis-headed Thoth -,ay appear naked, except for jackal-headed

✓o rship
~oth's appearance in the names of several ev.: Kingdom monarchs (e.g., Tuthmosis ~ rn of Thoth') shows important royal ....:ceptance and patronage of the god's cult, ..1t earlier references to offerings made in pri-~ne tombs on the festival of Thoth also show ~ importance of this god to non-royal indi.duals, and his vvorship appears to have ·,\-a.ys had a vvide base among ancient Egyp
tians. It is uncertain ,vhether the ancient Khemnu, which the Greeks called Hermopolis or 'Hermesto,vn' (the modern el-Ashmunein) in i\!Iiddle Egypt \Vas the original cult centre of Thoth, although it was certainly his chief centre of ,vorship in dynastic tin1es. It is possible that Thoth had an early cult centre in the Delta as the 15th Lower Egyptian no1ne had the ibis as its emblem. Thoth also had a sanctuary at el-Baqliya in the Delta, in the Dakhla Oasis in the \vestern desert, and even in the Sinai at Serabit el-Khadim. A little to the ,vest of Hermopo!is the necropolis of Tuna el-Gebel is the site of an extensive catacomb, the Ibeum, \.Vhich housed the mummified bodies of thousands of ibises, as well as many baboons, \Vhich were sold to pilgrims as votive offerings to the god. Another large burial ground for ibises and baboons was located at Saqqara, and these catacombs well illustrate the continued widespread popularity of Thoth in the religion of the later periods. In the 4th century BC the high priest of Thoth, Petosiris, renovated the cult centre of Hermopolis in the wake of the Persian invasion, and constructed a splendid tomb for himself decorated on its exterior with images of Thoth as ibis and baboon and inscribed inside \.vith texts ,vhich shov.t the god's great local importance. Thoth was, naturally, particularly venerated by scribes, who it is said made a small libation to the god by pou ring a drop of •.vater out of the pot in v.thich they dipped their brushes at the beginning of each day. Amulets of the god as an ibis or an ibisheaded man - sometirnes holding the divine wedjat eye occur, though those depicting him as a baboon were more common. These amulets ,vere v-1orn in life, many presumably by scribes. T he wisdom and magical powers ascribed to Thoth meant that he 1;vas naturally invoked in many spells utilized in popular magic and religion.

CROCODILE DE IT I ES
The crocodile \,Vas one of Egypt's most dangerous animals and it is not difficult to see why the creature held an impressive degree of religious and mythological status. Although a number of minor crocodile deities may have existed, most of these \Vere assimilated \,vith the powertul god Sobek who ,:vas venerated throughout Egypt. The composite, crocodile-headed Ammut was also an important deity who must be included in this section.
Arnmut
Mythology
The Ammut was a co1nposite myth ical creature whose head - and therefore most essential aspect places her with crocodile deities. Her na1ne meant 'female devourer' or 1nore fully, 'female devou rer of the dead'. In this role, as an undenvorld deity, she vvas also called 'great of death' and 'eater of hearts' and was supposedly the destroyer of those who had led ,.vicked lives and who ,vere not to be granted access into the afterlife. In tbe <reality' of Egyptian myth and magic this fate ,vas usually circumvented, but the goddess nevertheJess ren1ained a fearsome token of afterlife retribution.
Iconography
Ammut combined elements of the most dangerous animals knovvn to the Egyptians. Her head was that of the crocodile, her neck, mane and foreparts those of the lion (though occasionally a leopard),

and her rear quarters were those of the hippopotamus. lt has been suggested that this composite form of land and water animals left the damned no place of escape from the goddess's ,vrath. Ammut appears ahnost exclusively in the vignettes of funerary papyri, especially illustrations of Chapter 125 of the Book of the Dead 1Nhere she is sho"vn waiting beside the scale on vvhich the heart of the deceased is weighed against the feather of 111.aat in the 'Hall of the Tvvo Truths'.
Worshi p
A1nmut vvas not \Vorshipped in any fonnal cult and does not appear to have received popular veneration despite the fact that her image ,vas doubtless recognized by many if not most ancient Egyptians. Although the na1ne of Atnrnut \¥as written with
the determinative for 'deity' (seep. 26), the goddess \.Vas primarily viewed as a demonic creature to be avoided and whose power must be overcome.
Sobek
Mythology
Sebek \lvas venerated from at least Old Kingdom times, and while the name of the god 1neans simply 'crocodile', he was regarded as a powerful deity with several important associations. In the Pyramid Texts he is said to be the son of Neith and c.alled the 'raging one' 1..vho 'takes ,vornen from their husbands vvhenever he wishes according to his desire' but \.vho also 1nakes green the herbage of the fields and river banks (PT 507-10) - tying hi1n to both procreative and vegetative fertility. He was.



quite naturally, a god of \Vater (it was said that the "\ile issued from his sweat) and of areas such as marshes and riverbanks, wherever crocodiles were .:ornmonly found. Sobek was also said to be 'Lord
f Bakhu', the mythological mountain of the horizon where it ,vas asserted he had a temple n1ade of .:arne]ian. He ,vas linked vvith the cults of certain
other gods, such as Arnun, Osiris and especiaJly that of the sun god in the for1n of Sobek-Re. This association \Vith the sun god led to his being identified by the Greeks \Vith their own god Helios. Sobek was also associated with the Egyptian king and could act as a symbol of pharaonic potency and might.

Iconography
Fully or partly zoomorphic in his representations, Sobek may appear as a crocodile - often seated upon a shrine or altar - or as a man with the head of a crocodile. In either guise he often wears a headdress consisting of a sun disk with horns and tall plumes. \iVhen shown in semi-human form he may also wear a tripartite \Vig. The god is repeatedly associated with the colour green in his representations and called 'green of plume' (PT 507) in textual sources. His link \Vith the Egyptian king led to the particularly fine statue of An1enophis III and Sobek now in the Luxor

Worship
While the worship of this god is kno,:vn frorn Old Kingdon, times through to the Ron1an Period, it \Vas given particu lar prominence during the Midd1e Kingdom as the names of several rulers of the 12th and 13th dynasties - such as Sobekneferu 'beautiful of Sobek' and Sobekhotep 'Sobek is satisfied' - ind icate. The

god's sanctuaries were numerous and widespread. but the two main cult centres of Sobek were i1: the area of the ancient Shedet (the Greek Crocodilopolis and modern Medinet el-Fayum) ir. the Fayun1 region which was the home of the 12thdynasty rulers, and at Korn Ombo in Upper Egypt ,vhere he and his consort Hathor and son Khonsu shared a temple \Vith Horus. Other important cu:r sites were located at Gebelein and Gebel el-SilsiJa_ His temples were usually provided \Vlth pools cor.taining sacred crocodiles .vhich were mummified when they died. While apotropaic amulets of croc· odiles are known from virtually all periods, amulets of crocodiles or crocodile-headed men wearin; sun disks and plumes clearly represent the god anc seern to have been "vorn in life.

Apophis
"1ythology
-\pophis was the great adversary of the sun god Re nd the embodiment of the powers of dissolution. .:arkness, and non-being. The huge serpent \Vas '.:elieved to have existed from the beginning of time !1 the waters of primeval chaos which preceded 1eation and it \vas thought that he \vould continue n exist in an endlessly malevolent cycle of attack, ~efeat and resurgent attack. The god is not attested '.:efore the Middle Kingdom and seems to have nrne into being in the uncertain and fearful times hich followed the pyramid age. It is the Ne,v !\.ingdom funerary texts which provide most of the i-\'vdence for the god's mythology. A.ccording to hese various mythic accounts, as the sun made its '"'!ghtly voyage through the underworld and each "'lorning as it emerged. the solar barque ""as ~ eked by the great serpent \vhose terrifying roar -hoed through the under\vorld. Apophis was metimes equated \.Vith Seth, the god of chaos, yet ""'. son1e texts the aid of that same god was enlisted ~ defeating the serpent. It v,ias said that each night "\pophis hypnotized Re and the entourage vvho sail irh him except for the god Seth who resisted the -erpent's deadly stare and repulsed him with the rrust of a great spear. The serpent was also said

to hinder the passage of the solar barque by means of its coi1s which are described as 'sandbanks', and also by gorging the waters of the undenvorld river in order to attempt to strand the barque o{ Re. Other deities and the dead themselves were also involved in the cyclic defeat of the great serpent in the various stories, most notably in the Book of Gates, by Isis, Neith and Serket and by various deities. some in the form of n1onkeys, ,,vho successfu lly capture the monster with 1nagical nets. I-le is then restrained by deities including the earth god Geb and the sons of Horus, and his body cut into pieces - only to revive in the ongoing cycle. In some versions of the myth the sun god was in fact encircled or swallov.,ed by the serpent who later disgorged him as a metaphor of rebirth and rene\val. Apophis may thus bear many epithets ranging from evil lizard, opponent and enemy to \.VOrld encircler and serpent of rebirth.
Iconography
In the vignettes of the funerary texts and in other settings in \vhich he is depicted, Apophis is shown as a large serpent, sometimes with tightly compressed, spring-like coils to emphasize his great size. Almost invariably Apophis is sho\~n restrained, dismembered, or in the process of being destroyed,often by multiple knivl:'.s. Only a relatively few scenes transcend this pattern. A scene painted

within the tomb of Ramesses VI in the Va lley of the K.ings shows the serpent 1..vith t\velve heads above its back representing those it has swallov.red vvho are freed from the 1nonster - if only briefly \vhen it is vanquished; and in private tombs and funerary papyri, another scene of a different type
is found where Re or Hathor appear in feline form in order to slay the chaos serpent by cutting it up \vith a knife. There are also a number of temple scenes (at Dendera, Deir el-Bahri, Luxor and Philae) \Vhich depict the king striking a circular ball-like object \:vhich represents the evil 'eye of Apoph is'.
Worship
Although the god ,.vas neither worshipped in a formal cult nor incorporated into popular veneration, Apophis entered both spheres of religion as a god or demon to be protected against. Like the god Seth, Apophis was associated with frightening natural events such as unexplained darkness, storms and earthquakes as well as his underlying threat to rhe very stability of the cosrnos, so magical texts
~nd rituals were produced to combat these things. The so-called Book of Apophis was a collection of :hese magical texts and spells dating to the late \few Kingdom, though the best preserved example - the Brernner-Rhind Papyrus in the British .Yiuseum - \,vas produced in the 4th century BC. These spells for the 'overthrowing of Apophis' provided protection from the po"vers symbolized by this deity or from snakes which could be vie\,ved as minor yet dangerous manifestations of the monster. During the Late Period vvhen such a ritual book \.Vas read in temples daily to protect the world from the threat of the sun god's arch enemy, a wax model of the serpent was cut into pieces and burnt ,vith fire. Other spells used to protect against A.pophis involved drawing a picture of the serpent on a piece of papyrus, then sealing it in a box \Vhich was spat upon and set on fire.
Denwen
Den\.ven vvas a serpent god vvith dragon-like ability known from Old Kingdom ti1nes. In the Pyramid Texts Denvven ,vas said to have the power to cause a fiery conflagration which vvould destroy the gods, but the serpent was thwarted from this act by the deceased king.
Kebehwet
Kebebvvet \.vas a celestial serpent (assuming a Jerivation of her name from the word kebhu, ·firmament') who is mentioned several times in the Pyramid Texts. She vvas said to be the daughter of Anubis and the king's 'sister' and one vvhom he loves. The Pyramid Texts also some\.vhat enigmati
cally identify Kebehwet \1/ith the king's middle or hindparts (PT 1749, etc.), and assert that she refreshed and purified the heart of the deceased monarch with pure ,vater from four nemset jars (PT 1180) and that the goddess helped open the 'windo\.vs of the sky' to assist the king's resurrec
tion (PT 468). Her ministrations were eventually extended to all of the dead, but the goddess was never a very important deity.
Mehen
Mythology
The coiled serpent god knov"n as Mehen protected
the god Re on his nightly journey through the underworld. The earliest kno\.vn mention of the god is in the Coffin Texts of the i\!Iiddle Kingdom \.Vhere there is reference to 'the mysteries of Niehen' (CT 493,495), which may have involved specific rituals related to the veneration of the serpent deity. The same texts also assert that the god is a vvarden of criminals - primarily meaning the enemies of Re - and it seems that the deceased for whom the spells "''ere inscribed was thought to assist in this work of Mehen.
Iconography
The Coffin Texts (CT 758-60) tell how the serpent god exists as nine concentric rings which are 'roads of fire' encircling and protecting the sun god and Peter Piccione has shov,,n that the so-called 'coiled serpent board game', examples of which have survived from the Predynastic Period through to the

Nehebu-Kau
Old Kingdom in Egypt, was based on this image of Mehen. Later, in the New 1<.ingdom, Mehen is extensively represented in the vignettes of the
'Underworld Books' such as the Amduat. There the Mythology god is depicted as an immense serpent, often sbovvn coiled around or above the shrine-like cabin of the boat of Re, protecting the sun god from evil and especially from the inimical underwor1d serpent Apophis.
Worship
As with most of the more bizarre denizens of the underworld Mehen \vas primarily the subject of myth rather than an object of ritua1worship.
Meretseger
Mythology
Goddess of the pyran-1idal peak v-1hich lies at the heart of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes, fVIeretseger presided over the whole Theban necropolis. Sometimes called Dehenet-Irnentet 'the peak of the West' after her dwelling place, her more usual name was i\lleretseger 'she \vho loves silence', which \Vas an apt one for the goddess of the lonely and desolate region uninhabited except by the deceased and, temporarily, by those workmen who constructed the tombs there.
Iconography
Although 1\lleretseger was identified with the peak of the Theban royal necropolis, the hill itself rarely enters the goddess's iconography. Instead, she is usually represented as a coiled serpent, as a rearing cobra - sometimes with a \Voman's head, as a snake-headed woman, or occasionally, as a scorpion with a female head. The serpent and scorpion were among the few creatures to inhabit the remote desert site and these were seen, therefore, as fitting symbols for the manifestation of the goddess. In her various forms, the goddess may wear a disk v.rith horns, a modius vvith uraeus, or other attribute upon her head.
Worship
Because she \Vas worshipped primarily by the workmen of the royal necropolis, Meretseger's cult is attested from much of the New I<ingdom but seldon1 later - when the Theban necropolis ceased to be used for royal burials. A good many stelae dedicated to the goddess have been found in the workmen's vi llage of Deir el-fVIedina; and some of these, imploring the goddess's forgiveness, are among the most poignant of Egyptian rel igious texts (see p. 50)_ lVIeretseger was believed to strike those guilty of crimes with loss of sight or poisonous stings and bites, but a number of stelae record the goddess's forgiveness and the recovery of the \vorkmen.
First attested in the Pyramid Texts, the serpent god Nehebu-Kau whose name means 'he who harnesses the spirits' \.Vas regarded as a benign and helpful deity. He assisted the deceased king in various ways and seems to act as an intercessory on his behalf in that several spells record the king's desire that his 'good name' be told to Nehebu-Kau who \Vil! 'raise up this good utterance...to the Two Enneads' (PT 1708). The god is said to be the son of the scorpion goddess Serket, though an a1ternative tradition claimed that he was the son of the earth god Geb
and the serpent harvest goddess Renenutet. His chthonic origins and serpentine nature - coupled with the 'seven cobras' he is said to have S\vallowed - are the sources of Nehebu-Kau's considerable povJer. This is seen in later texts \vhich assert that Nehebu-Kau is not subject to any hannful magic and cannot be harmed by \Vater or fire. The god'~ consort was said to be Nehemtawy.
Iconography
Although he is called a 'great serpent, n1u\titudinous of coils' in the Pyramid Texts and may be depicted in this manner, Nehebu-Kau was frequently represented as a man with a serpent's head and tail. In serpent form he is sometimes depicted on the



LVehebu-Kauin hybrid or semi-anthropo1norphic fonn,
as a man wi.th the head of a
serpent. This type of representation of the deity tends to appear in later
contexts, whik earlier depictions rnore frequently show the god in fully serpent
form.
sides of divine thrones, doubtless as a protective deity, and in his semi-anthropomorphic form he is often depicted on amulets and plaques with his arms raised before him holding an offering pot.
Worship
The cult of Nehebu-Kau was practised at Herakleopolis l\llagna (modern Ihnasya el-l\lledina) and probably in other locations, and a feast of the god is known to have been celebrated since at least Middle Kingdom times on the first day of the first month of the \.vinter season. The powetiul nature and assistive qualities of Nehebu-Kau also led to his use in many amulets, and it is probably fair to assun1e that he ,:vas quite vvidely venerated in popular religion. vVhile the god appears on amulets of late New Kingdom times, most date to the Third lntermediate.Period and later.
Renenutet
Mythology
,\ !though serpentine in forn1, Renenutet (Egyptian for 'snake \.vho nourishes') was a popular and beneficent deity. Protective in nature and of a nurturing rather than venomous disposition, she v1as a goddess of the harvest and a divine nurse. In the Old Kingdom Renenutet ,vas venerated as a guardian of the king in this life and in the beyond, being identified, like Wadjet, with the flame-breathing royal uraeus (PT 302) and also the king's robe 'of which the gods are afraid' (PT 1755, 1794). In the latter aspect she came to be someti1nes associated \.vith the bandages of the mummy. Her aspect as a god
dess of fertility and harvest is clearly denoted in her epithets 'lady of the fertile land', 'lady of the threshing floor' and 'lady of the granaries', and her role in this area n1ay have originated in the imagery of the serpent vvho protects the crops from the rats and mice which threatened standing crops and stored grain alike. Renenutet was also identified with the household and family life in her role as provider, nourisher and as a nurse of infants. The interrelationships of the goddess v.;ith other deities were extensive. In the Fayum Renenutet can1e to be linked 1,vith Sobek and Horus as a member of a triad named by the Greeks Hermouthis, Sekonopis and Ankhoes. As a grain goddess she was identified as the mother of Osiris in his form of the child Nepri, and in the Book of the Dead Renenutet is said to be the mother of Horus by Atum and thus came to be identified with Isis, with whom she shared the trait of divine nurse.Her associations with chilch-en also identified her with Meskhenet as a birth goddess and 1,vith Hathor ,x.rhose headdress she wore. In the New Kingdom Litany of Re she appears in the underworld as the 'Lady of Justification' and in this form she may be associated vvith the goddess fviaat. Finally, in the Late Period, like the god Shay, Renenutet was associated ,vith the idea of fate and destiny, deciding not only the length of an individual's life but also many of its events.
Iconography
The iconography of Renenutet is 1nost :frequently that of an erect cobra vvith a sun disk and horns atop its head, often with tv10 tall plumes surmounting the solar disk. The goddess may also be depicted anthropomorphically as a woman or a \.\roman vvith a snake's head, standing or enthroned

and sometimes holding or nursing a child \Vhicb may be her son Nepri or a more generalized infant. In vignettes of the Litany of Re Renenutet is depicted as a mwnmiform being \Vith the head of a cobra, though this is a specialized iconography not usually applied to the goddess. Sometin1es she is the object of veneration of minor gods as in a granary at Karnak where the god Hapy \Vas shown presenting offerings to her. Terracotta figu res of the Ptolemaic Period depict the goddess as a form of Isis \Vith a snake's head rising from a woman's body or \vith a woman's head atop a snake.
Worship
While amulets depicting the goddess sho\v she may have functioned as a protective deity, it \Vas as a goddess of fecundity that Renenutet was rnost widely venerated, and the goddess was popular among agricultural \vorkers ~specially. The festivals of Renenutet were celebrated in the last month of the season \vhen crops were so,vn, and in the following month, the first month of the summer season vvhen they began to ripen. From Midd\e Kingdom times on\,vards we have evidence of the cult of the goddess in the Fayum \vhere large scale crop production \1/as accomplished, and her cult in the city of Dja (modern Medinet Madi) 1vvas particularly strong. She was also evidently venerated at Terenuthis (Korn Abu Billo) in the Delta, and in the New Kingdom \Ve find evidence of her \vorship at
Giza, Abydos, and especially at Thebes. vVe kno\v Renenutet was honoured in shrines erected in harvest :fields and vineyards, and during the harvest and the pressing of grapes offerings were made before her image. Shrines ded1cated to the goddess were also placed in magazines and granaries \.Vhere the harvested crops were stored. The affection of the ancient Egyptians for this goddess is clear, As a much loved deity Renenutet even survived the pagan era in that she was ultimately transformed into the Greek Thermouthis ,vho \vas later venerated as a Christian saint.
Wadjet
Mythology
The cobra goddess Wadjet was associated with the Nile Delta region from early times and became the tutelary deity of Lower Egypt in juxtaposition to her counterpart, the vulture goddess Nekhbet of Upper Egypt. Her name means 'the green one' vvhich may refer to the natural colour of the serpent or perhaps to the verdant Delta region which she inhabited. Perhaps because she \Vas associatedl more with the wodd of the living, the goddess does not play an important role in the Pyramid Texts. though references to the crown as a goddess do give her the epithet 'great of magic' (PT 194, 196). She was certainly closely linked to the king, both in the



't1,,vo ladies' or 'two goddesses' title of his royal protocol and as a protective deity in the form of the royal uraeus worn on the monarch's crown or headdress. In later texts she is called the 'mistress of awe' and 'mistress of fear', as mythologically the royal serpent spat flames in defense of the king; and military inscriptions (such of those of Ramesses II regarding the great Battle of Kadesh) describe her as slaying the monarch's enemies with her fiery breath. In the cycle of rnyths relating to Horus as represented in the temple of Hathor at Dendera, vVadjet acts as the young god's nurse when he is raised in the Delta site of Khemnis, giving her an association with Isis who usually took this role. \Vadjet \vas also associated 1,,vith a number of leonine goddesses as an 1Eye of Re', and li1<e them she is sometirnes said to be the mother of the god '.'iefertem.
Iconography
Usually Wad.jet assumed the form of the erect cobra 1,,vith hood extended in the creature's pose of reacliness to strike, and it is in this form that the goddess is represented as the uraeus \lvhich protected both king and gods and was often shown attached to the solar disk - even during the Amarna Period 'Nhen the depiction of most non-solar deities was avoided or proscribed. The raised serpent is often shown seated along 'vvith the vulture Nekhbet on two baskets, an iconography known from the 1st dynasty.
.
Because of the connection between Wad.jet and Nekhbet some fusion of their iconographies took place, and the serpent vVadjet may be shown as a vulture or as a serpent \vith 1,,vings, just as a cobra depicted wearing the White Crown usually represents Nekhbet. It is possible that some depictions and amulets in the form of a papyrus sceptre or column, especially when surmounted by a cobra, are also n1eant to represent the goddess due to the similarity of the Egyptian \vord for papyrus with her name. As an 'Eye of Re' Wadjet can appear in fully leonine form and can thus also be depicted as a cobra with a lion's head - a form vvhich may represent her or other 'Eye' goddesses. Amulets of Wadjet in various forms were quite common beginning in the Saite Period (724- 712 BC).
Worship
The major cult centre of Wadjet \vas in the region of the ancient towns of Pe and Dep which came to be called Buto (modern Tell el-Fara'in) in the northwestern Delta. Her shrine 1,,vas called the per-nu or 'house of flame' and is attested from predynastic tin1es, eventually becoming representative of all the local shrines in its region. Royal sarcophagi patterned after the distinctive form of the per-nu shrine
are known fron1 the Old Kingdom, and the burial mastaba of the 5th-dynasty monarch Shepseskare seems to have been constructed in this shape. In the Ne1,v Kingdom several royal sarcophagi of the later 18th dynasty take this form, as does the innermost of the four funerary shrines of Tutankhamun. iVlany coffins and sarcophagi were also made in the

shape of the per-nu throughout the later periods, as \1/ere other funerary containers, shovving that the Lower Egyptian shrine had become thoroughly associated with the funerary sphere to an extent that was often seemingly independent of direct associations with Wadjet herself. Yet the goddess was often incorporated in funerary decoration, and this provides much of the evidence for her veneration.
Weps et
The serpent goddess Wepset, whose name means 'she who burns', appears to be one of the various identities of the fiery uraeus (see \Vadjet) \vho guarded gods and kings, and also of the fearsome 'Eye of Re'. She is first attested in the Coffin Texts as the 'Eye', and in New Kingdom afterlife texts she is said to destroy the enemies of Re-Osiris. Wepset is usually represented in serpent .form, though in the Graeco-Roman temples of Nubia she appears in anthropomorphic form as a goddess ,vearing a uraeus on her head, sometimes \3⁄4'ith horns and sun disk, or even vvith the head of a lion linking her to other 'Eye' goddesses such as Hathor and Tefnut. Although no temple of Wepset has been found at the site, known texts claim that the island of Biga was a cult centre of the goddess, and she appears in other temples of that area and Lower Nubia.
Were t-Hekau
The name Weret-Hekau, \vhich means 'great of magic' or 'great enchantress' as it is sometimes translated, was applied to several goddesses. In the Pyramid Texts the natne is associated with the divine uraeus (see p. 227) and with the crown of Lower Egypt as manifestations of the goddess Wadjet, and the name was in fact written with the determinative sign of a serpent. In later times the name is found applied more widely and also takes on a more independent nature. vVeret-Hekau is mentioned several tirnes on the objects fro1n the tomb of Tutankhamun, particularly on a small shrine \Vhich contained an image of the goddess as a rearing serpent with the head of a woman who is depicted nursing the king, a maternal role vvhich is found in the Pyramid Texts for the uraeus goddess (PT 1107-09).
Yam
A Semitic god, Yarn is best known in Canaanite sources from Ugarit and else"vhere v,1hich sho\v he \Vas a tyrannical, monstrous deity of the sea and other bodies of water. He \Vas knovvn also in Egypt as a minor foreign god, and a fragmentary papyrus

indicates that in his mythology his demands of tribute from other gods ,vere thwarted by the goddess _A.starte. In Canaanite myth he was finally defeated by the god Baal, and in Egyptian sources by Seth vvith whom Baal vvas identified. The 1nythological battle rnay have been representative of winter sea storms which calmed in thespring. Yam is not clearly described in the ancient sources and has no clear iconography though he appears to be serpentine in form. He may have had a great (sometimes sevenheaded) sea monster in his follovving or he could himself have been that monster. Unserved by any Egyptian cult, he 1nay have nevertheless been a god kno\:vn and feared by Egyptian seafarers.
AMP H IBIA N AND FI SH DEIT IES
Hatmeh yt
Mythology
A minor fish goddess, Hatmehyt vvas worshipped in the Delta city of Mendes but does not seem to have played a part in any major mythic cycle and little is known of her. Her naine means 'she who is before the fishes'; this could suggest either pre-eminence being foremost among fish deities - or temporal pri



macy, as the one \.Vho \Vas before in the prin1eval \Vorld. Lack of mythological examples would perhaps suggest the former meaning as the most likely. Hatmehyt was eventually incorporated into the cult of Banebdjedet, the ram god of Mendes, as the consort of that more powerful god.
Iconography
Hatmehyt "vas depicted as a woman \vearing a fish en1blem upon her head, or in the fonn of a fish. It has sometimes been though t that the goddess's emblem was a dolphin, but it is now believed that the creature represented is the common Nile Lepidolus fish.
Worship
The Delta city of Mendes, chief cult centre of Hatmehyt, doubtless contained a temple of this goddess at some time. Despite her eventual assirni~ation into the cult of the ram god of Banebdjedet, Hatmehyt does not seem to have been venerated much beyond the Delta, perhaps because fish, which were regarded as taboo in many areas. were 3-e}dom viewed as divine symbols. Usually she is represented as a \V0man with a fish on her head. .-\mu lets on the Schilbe fish, which represented the deity, first appear early in the 26th dynasty.
Heket
M ythology
_.\ frog goddess vvho assisted in fashioning the child :n the womb and 1,vho presided over its birth, Heket .5 first attested in the Pyramid Texts where she 1ssists the deceased king in his journey to the sky Pr 1312). Her connection ,vith birth is first apparent in the Middle Kingdom story preserved in the ·restcar Papyrus, hovvever, in which the goddess hastened the birth' of the three kings \.vho inaugurated the 5th dynasty. Also from this time, the term
'servant of Heket' may have been applied to n1id,vives in Egyptian society. l\tlythologically, Heket's life-giving povver caused her to be associated with the Osiride family of deities and \Vith the afterlife, and she was regarded as the wife of Haroeris/ Harwer and venerated as a female complement of K.hnum.
Iconography
Heket was represented as a frog or as a 1,voman with a frog's head. While temple representations tend to utilize the partially anthropornorphic form, amulets of the goddess are usual1y zoomorphic.
Worship
1'he main cult centre of Heket was at Herwer (perhaps modern Hu r near el-Ashmunein), and the remains of a temple of the goddess have been fou nd at Qus. She also appears in the temples of several other deities and \vas depicted receiving an offering of \1/ine from Sethos I in his temple at Abydos, for example, and mentioned in the tomb of Petosiris (c. 300 BC) at Tuna el-Gebel, shovving her cult was still strong. In less formal contexts Heket appears along \Vith other deities on ivory 'wands' of the l\tliddle Kingdo1n, and she appears in amuletic form from Nevv Kingdom times.

Hededet
Hededet was a scorpion goddess whose characteristics resemble Serket in n1any ways but who \vas associated in the later periods with Isis. Like both of these goddesses, Hededet (in Egyptian Hedjedjet) can symbolize motherly qualities; and amulets in the form of a seated goddess with a scorpion on her head and nursing a child are likely to represent Hededet.
Khepri
Mythology
Khepri was the form of the sun god 1⁄41hich represented the solar disk rising on the eastern horizon. As such he was one of the three forms or aspects of the solar deity ,vho was 'Khepri in the morning, Re at midday and Atum in the evening', though 1t is impossible to know whether the god originally functioned in this carefully delineated role or \.vhether he was accorded the position when, at some point, he was fused into the Heliopolitan cult of the sun. The na1ne of the god in its earliest knov\?n occurrences, kheprer, is simply that of the scarab or dung beetle (Scarabaeus sacer) which the Egyptians visualized as a symbol of the god due to the beetle's habit of rolling a ball of mud or dung along the ground in.a manner suggestive of the god pushing the solar disk across the sky. The female scarab beetle also Jays her eggs in a similar ball from which the young eventually emerge as though spontaneously. The biology of the insect thus seems to underlie the na1ne of the god as Khepri suggests the Egyptian verb khepe1': 'develop' or 'come into being'. As the 'developing one' l(hepri was the god of the first sunrise at the dawn of creation, and was thus linked \Vith Atum as Atutn·Khepri. To some extent l{hepri also represented the sun in a general way and he could be linked with the solar god Re, though his identity as the morning sun remained primary and his essential mythological role was that of raising the sun from the horizon into the body of the sky goddess Nut. The god could therefore be said to be swallowed by Nut each evening and to travel through her body in the night hours to be reborn each morning. As a god \¥ho ,vas constantly reborn Khepri \.Vas also directly associated v1ith the concept of res•
urrection. In this regard it has been suggested that the underground tunnels of the insect take the same form as the vertical shaft and horizonta1passage found in Old Kingdom mastaba tombs, and that the pupae of the insect resemble the bandaged mummy of the deceased, though there is no indication that the Egyptians themselves recognized such similar ities, for these types of embellishments to the lore of the scarab were recorded by Classical v,1riters such as Plutarch and Horapolio.
Iconography
I<hepri is n1ost commonly represented in the forrn of the scarab beetle \Vith varying degrees of stylization of the insect's anatomy. Painted and inlaid works often colour the insect blue or utilize lapis lazuli inlay to symbolically stress the beetle's asso• ciation with the heavens, though in the vignettes of funerary texts the scarab is invariably sho\vn black as in nature. The beetle may be shown alone or pushing the solar disk ahead of it; and although in nature the insect usually propels its mud ball with its hind legs, Egyptian depictions prefer to shov.r the ball being pushed in a for\vard manner by the insect's front legs. The vignettes of funerary papyr1 and other scenes show the god standing on a boat being lifted by the god Nun as the personification of the primeval \.vatery chaos to,vards the heavens in
representation of the creation event. The body ,of the insect was occasionally fused with that of other

creatures such as the falcon or vulture, with the body of the scarab often being united with avian legs, tail and wings. Sometimes, as in the 4th-centu· ry BC tomb of Petosiris at Tuna el-Gebel, the insect is depicted with the Atef Crovvn of Osiris in order to unite the solar and nether\vorld realms in one i1nage. Khepri ,:vas also depicted in semianthropo1norphic form as a tnan vvith a scarab beetle as his head, as may be found in the tomb of Nefertari in the Valley of the Queens, and representations of this type someti111es unite the mutnmiform body of Osiris \\1ith a scarab head in
the same kind of linkage indicated by the Atefcrowned beetle. A final variant on the image of the god is that ,vhich fuses the head of a rain on a scarab body in order to represent the joining of Atum-Khepri as the creator sun god or the combined rising-setting sun.

Worship
As with many related cosmic deities, Khepri was not accorded a cult of his own. though examples of colossal stone statues of the beetle god (such as the example now preserved beside the sacred lake in the temple of Amun at Karnak) suggest that the god was honoured in many Egyptian temples and might have represented the concepts of creation and the ongoing solar journey 1Nhich were syrnbo]ically incorporated into temple architecture. On a 1nuch smaller scale, scarab beetle amulets are known from the 5th dynasty, and scarabs used as seals appear in the First Intermediate Period and were produced in great numbers from Middle Kingdom times on\\1ard. The undersides of these scarabs i.,vere incised \Vith the oi,.vner's names and titles, with the names of deities or kings used for their protective value. or simply with decorative designs. Egyptian Icings even used the undersides of scarabs as a medium for the recording of victories and other important events, i,.vith those of Amenophis Ill recording events as varied as the king's lion hunting



expeditions and the arrival of a ne\\r princess for his hare1n. Other types of scarabs included 'heart scarabs' placed on the 1nummy of the deceased and scaraboids which fused the basic form of the scarab with the image of some other creature. The scarab was, in fact, the most popular of Egyptian amulets, and while Khepri may not have enjoyed the \Videspread services of a formal cult, his utilization as a potent sy1nbol of creation and resurrection made him an almost ubiquitous deity in ancient Egyptian culture.
Sepa
The centipede god Sepa, sometimes called 'the centipede of Horus', is attested from Old '"Kingdom times through to the Graeco-Roman Period. He was linked \Vith the gods of Heliopolis, particularly vvith Horus and with Osiris, sometimes appearing as Osiris-Sepa. In addition to his myriopodic form, Sepa could be represented with the head of a donkey
or as a mwnmiform god (relating to his association with Osiris) ,,_,ith nvo short horns on his head. He ,vas viewed as a protective deity having the po,-ver to prevent snake bites and \vas honoured with a festival from early times. A temple of the god was situated in Heliopolis.
Serket
Mythology
Serket \,Vas a scorpion goddess knovvn from the 1st dynasty \Vhose protective role is attested from at least the Old Kingdom when she appears in the Pyramid Texts - both alone and in the company of other goddesses- guarding the deceased king. Her importance as a protective deity is seen in texts such as that in \Vhich the king clairns 'My mother is Isis, my nurse is Nephthys...Neith is behind me, and Serket is before me' (PT 1375). Along with these same goddesses - Isis, Nephthys and Neith - Serket became one of the four protective deities who

guarded coffins and the canopic chests and jars in which embaltned internal organs were placed, with the specific canopic responsibility of protecting the
god Qebesenuef (seep. 88).She is often paired with Neith as Isis is with Nephthys. Her funerary role 1,.vas a primary one, and she is sometimes called 'mistress of the beautiful house' referring to the embalming pavilion. The ful1 form of her Egyptian name - Serket hetyt- means 'she who causes the throat to breathe' and appears to be euphemistic of the fact that the scorpion can be fatally dangerous, and the goddess may heal just as she might destroy. Serket also fu !filled the role of a 1nother goddess in 1.vhich she was called 'Serket the great, the divine mother'. Historically the scorpion was regarded as

a symbol of motherhood in many areas of the Near East, and as early as the Pyramid Texts
Serket is said to nurse the king (PT 1427). In the Nev; Kingdom scenes which record the 'divine birth' of Amenophis III in Luxor 1'emple and that of Hatshepsut in her mortuary temple, Serket is present with Neith supporting the god Amun and the queen on the marriage bed. She also appears vvith Nephtbys in the mythological story of the birth of Horus \vhen the t.vo goddesses assist Isi8 in guarding the infant god after he is stung or bitten. In the same myth Isis is accompanied by seven scorpions \.vhich are emanations of Serker. and which protect lsis and her unborn child but also punish a woman who refuses to gire her shelter. According to Egyptian mythologr,



Serket was herself the mother of the serpent god Nehebu-Kau.
Iconography
Serket is usually represented in anthropomorphic form as a \.VOman wearing a scorpion \Vith ra ised tail atop her bead. Almost always-as in the writing of the scorpion hieroglyph in the goddess's name and else\.vhere- the creature is not drawn completely for protective, magical reasons, having its sting and often its legs or claws omitted. This is the standard depiction of the goddess vvhen she appears in funerary contexts as, for example, in the graceful gilded statue which guarded the canopic chest in the tomb of Tutankhamun. In settings such as this the goddess stands with outstretched arms both protecting and embracing her charge. In her aspect of divine mother, however, Serket may be represented quite differently with the body of a \VOman, armed with knives, and with the heads of both a lioness and a crocodile. In funerary scenes Serket could be shown in fully zoomorphic for1n as a rearing cobra, and the goddess could also be represented in leonine form, as vvell as in the form of the scorpion. Amulets and images of the later dynasties \vhich show a scorpion with the head of a won1an wearing horns and solar disk may represent Serket vvith the attributes of Isis, Isis in scorpion form or simply a fusion of the ~:---""' two goddesses.
Worship
The cult of Serket is known to haveexisted since the 1st dynasty vvhen she appears on a funerary stela from Saqqara, though the presence of her 'priests' seems to indicate medical magicians rather than the servants of a temple. Early Egyptian amulets of scorpions - 1,,vhich are known from Old Kingdom times - could have been apotropaic in nature and n1ay not have represented Serket herself, though the goddess appears in anthropomorphic form as an an1ulet during the Late Period. As n1ight be expected, Serket appears in many magical spells although, odclly, the majority of kno1,,vn spells against scorpion stings invoke Isis rather than Serket. T here are, however, many spells in vvhich Serket is said to protect and heal poisonous bites, and she appears to have been a patroness of the practicioners of Jnagical medicine who dealt ,vith such bites.
Ta-Bitjet
.\ scorpion goddess said to be the wife of Horus, Ta-Bitjet vvas believed to have po\.ver against ".:>Oisonous bites and was invoked in many magical ~pells for this purpose. As is cotnmon with other minor goddesses invoked for anti-venom spells, 1a-Bitjet was sometimes conflated \.vith the much greater deity Isis.

Aten
Mythology
The mythology of tbe Aten - the radiant disk of the sun - is not only unique in Egyptian history but is also one of the most comple.,"< and controversial aspects of Egyptian religion. Forever associated \Vith the heretic pharaoh Amenophis IV/Akhenaten, the Aten predates that king but rose to become a universal and almost exclusive deity during his reign - only to plunge into virtual obscurity within a generation of Akhenaten's death. The word aien is known to have been used from at least Middle Kingdom times to designate the solar disk and is used in this way in the Coffin Texts; but in the 'Story of Sinuhe', from the same period, the word is used with the determinative for god (Papyrus Berlin 10499), and by mid-New I{ingdom times a solar god named Aten appears to be well established. Tuthmosis IV issued a commemorative scarab on which 1 the Aten functions as a god of war protecting the pharaoh, and his successor, Amenophis III, the father of Akhenaten,seems to have aciively encouraged the worship of Aten. The third Amenophis stressed solar worship in many of his extensive building works; and one of the epithets of this king was Tjekhen-Aten or 'radiance of Aten', a term which was also used in several other contexts during his reign. But it \vas with Amenophis IV/Akhenaten that the ultimate elevation of the Aten occurred. Exactly what kind of god the Aten was envisaged as at this time is not always clear. Recently, Raymond Johnson has discussed the possibility that the Aten worship promulgated by Akhenaten was one stressing the god as a deified form of his father, Amenophis III, but whatever the case may be in this regard, the Aten mythology propounded by Akhenaten \Vas revolutionary and had far-reaching consequences. Evidence such as the Great Hymn to the Aten shows that not only was the god vievv'ed as being universal and transcendent, but also the Aten's position relative to the king and his direct family was conceived of uniquely. Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti served the god directly and despite the existence of a priesthood of the Aten, Akhenaten alone was said to have true knowledge of the god. As a result, even the most universal aspects of the theology of Atenism were short-circuited in the closed system espoused by the god's chief adherent.

It could even be said that Atenism espoused a closed triad consisting of the Aten, Re and Akhenaten hi1nself. Even the high priest of the Aten was called the priest of Akhenaten - indicating not only the elevated position of the king in this theology but also the effective barrier that he forrr1ed between even his priests and the god Aten. The Aten's relationship with other gods was also complex. Akhenaten may have suppressed the cults of some deities, but there remains clear evidence that other gods \Vere admitted in the Atenist theology.

Principal of these other deities was the sun god Re who was equated ,,vith the Aten in certain contexts and "vho was retained in the renewed titulary of Akhenaten and incorporated in the names of two of the king's own daughters, Nefernefrure and Setepenre. Akhenaten also seems to have acknowledged other forms of the sun god, for example, by 1naking provision at his city of Akhetaten for a tomb for the Mnevis bull \.Vhich was held to be a physical manifestation of Re.

Detail of a h,nestone relief shou.Jing Nefertiti offering the early fonn of the Aten's
cartouches to the ditJine sun disk. 18th dynasty. Brooklyn Museit1n of Art.
In his capacity as universal god and king of all, the Aten ,vas given a titulary with two cartouche narnes of the same kind as those given to the .Egyptian king on his coronation.It existed in two forms - an earlier version which included the names of l\llaat, ReHorakhty and Shu and a later, n1ore focused protocol of the ninth year of Akhenaten's reign \'-fhich limited the identification of the Aten.
Early titulary:
Introduction:
Live, beautiful god who rejoices in Niaat [the goddess is depicted rather than just the phonetic symbol for truth] Lord of all which his disk circles Lord of the sky, Lord of the Earth Aten, living and great, Illuminating the 1:\vo lands lVIay my father live!

Conclusion;

Later titulary:
First cartouche:
Live Re, ruler of the two Horizons who rejoices [or becomes active] in the Horizon Second cartouche:
In his name of light that is in the Aten.
In this second version of the Aten's titulary Akhenaten replaced Re-Horakhty with Re (or possibly 'sun') and also replaced the name of the god Shu with a word for 'light' not associated with any god - thus divorcing the ,,.vorship of the Aten from traditional Egyptian polytheism.

also accepted - as in the early cartouche names of the Aten (see inset box), though this acceptance was later restricted.
Iconography
Originally it ,vas customary to represent Aten as a god in the form of a falcon-headed anthropomorphic deity similar to the usual depictions of Re or Re-Horakhty, However, early in the reign of Amenophis IV this iconography underwent a radical change in that the god began to be depicted in the form of the solar disk with a uraeus at its base and ,vith streaming light rays which terminated in hands which \.vere either left open or shown holding ankh signs when they fell upon the image of the king or a men1ber of the royal family. Although the origin of this iconographic form actually predates Amenophis IV/Akhenaten and examples can be found from the reign of Amenophis II (1427-1401 BC),
under Akhenaten it became the sole manner 1:\x;hich the Aten vvas depicted.
Worship
Evidence exists of the cult of the Aten at HeliopoE~ during the reign of Amenophis III, but it was under Amenophis IV/Akhenaten that the cult of the go<l reached its peak. Upon his accession, the latter kin._ constructed a large temple complex, which includec: at least three sanctuaries just outside the easter~ perimeter of the temple of Amun at I<arnak. vVithi:a short time of the founding of this ne\v temple, th ,vorship of Amun and other gods seems to hav been diminished and eventually, in the case Amun at least, actually proscribed. Beginning !:· approximately his 5th year when the king changec his name to Akhenaten, a ne1,v capital - Akhetarer 'the horizon of the Aten' - was built at the virg:~ site of el-i\marna in Nliddle Egypt, and nev,; temple:



v"ere built to honour the god. These included the socalled 'great temple' and 'small temple' vvhich ,vere constructed according to a novel architectural plan eruphasizing open access to the sun rather than the traditional darkness of Egyptian shrines. There also appears to have been temples of the Aten at Memphis, at Sesebi in Nubia and perhaps else,-vhere for at least part of Akhenaten's reign, though evidence for popular acceptance of the Aten religion is decidedly lacking. i\Jlany of the rock-cut ton1bs cut for the nobles of el-Amarna have prayers to the Aten (often seemingly extracts from the great hymn to the god) inscribed on their doorv.1ays, and there are other formal indications of respect for A.khenaten's god among the city's ruling elite, but A.tenisn1 remained an exclusive religion - only the king and his family are depicted worshipping the god and it is only to them that the Aten holds out the gift of life. There is no real evidence for personal, individual worship of the god on the part of the ordinary Egyptian \Vhose only access to the Aten \Vas thi-ougb the medium o-f the king.1'his situation created a religious vacuum which ·was unstable even from the beginning, and the presence of amulets and representations of various deities and other indications of traditional \.vorship demonstrate that even in the new capital popular \vorship of the older gods - even if covert in nature - nevertheless conti nued. Although the priesthoods of the various gods \Vere powerless to stop the religious changes \.vhich ca.me ,.vith Atenism during Akhenaten's lifetin1e, the religious and political realities extant at the end of the king's reign meant that a return to orthodoxy \Vas inevitable. Akhenaten's successors retur ned to Thebes, and the cults of Amun and Egypt's many other gods ,vere rene\.ved. The Aten's temples were
quickly deserted and vvithin a few years they were torn dov.111. often, ironically, to be used in the renevv
al and expansion of te,nples for the very gods Aten ism had sought to displace.
Moon
Unlike the solar aten, it is uncertain that the disk of the moon \.vas itself \1/0rshipped in Egypt as a deity during historical tin1es, and the evidence which is extant see,ns to sho\V that it ,.vas regarded rather as a sy1nbol or manifestation of specific deities associated vvith the moon. Most prominent of these gods were Horus (see p. 200), lab (see p. 111), and Thoth
(see p. 215), though the lunar disk ,vas also a symbol of Osiris according to the mythology of that god. Additionally, 14 individual deities v.1ere sometirnes associated \vith the days of the 1,,vaxing moon and 14 \Nere associated vvith the v1aning moon.

Long before the ancient Egyptian civilization reached its end, Egypt had exerted enormous influence over its neighbours, trading partners and even its enemies. l\lluch of that influence is reflected in the presence of Egyptian deities which have been detected as far from the Nile as Persia in the east and Britain in the west. The ancient Minoans, for example, absorbed the goddess Ta\.veret into their own culture (see p. 185), and the i1nage of the Egyptian god Bes (see p. 102) became that of the
Greek Gorgon. Sometimes the influence Yra~ oblique, yet it ,,vas clearly present. The Achaemenid Persians, who ruled at least part of Egypt fron1 the late 6th through to the 4th century BC, vverc: influenced considerably by Egyptian culture anc religion, and Persian rulers such as Darius the Grea~ even com1nissioned Egyptian-style statues of therr.selves, not unlike statues of Egyptian gods. Iinag~ of the Egyptian gods intrigued and mystified outsiders for centuries and were carried to man~ distant lands. Statues of Egyptian deities are thu~ known to have stood in many ancient cities and. at the height of the Roman Empire, Roman legion~ carried images of the protective god Bes (seep. 102 and the great goddess Isis (seep. 146) as far afield a~ England. The Rorr1ans vvere particularly enamoured of things Egytian and the Egyptian phoenix (setp. 212) - ·which ·was compared to undying Rome appears on the coinage of the late Roman Empire a:-a symbol of the Eternal City. It vvas also vievved a::an allegory of resurrection and life after death ideas that appealed to early Christians throughout the Empire. Only at the very end of Egypt's ancier.· history \1/hen the old beliefs gave way to ne,\ . monotheistic faiths, did Egypt's many deiti~
fall into oblivion - but even then, the old \\·a~=and old gods would prove to be the seeds frorr: which new religious ideas would continue : gro\v. Here, in fact, among the ancient gods ar. goddesses of the Nile lie the roots of many later religious traditions - and perhaps, ironicall: even the concept of n1onotheism itself (seep. 36 as well as that of the transcendent nature of th divine, can be traced ultirnately to Egyptiabeginnings. Whi le this is not to diminish fullt:r
developments of these concepts in later reli: ions, the influence of Egyptian deities an religion cannot be denied in the formative pe:--: ods of those same religions, and particular!· that of Christianity which provides an exceller case study of Egyptian influence. Christianity took root in Egypt at an ear;_ date. By the end of the 2nd century it ,v~.. already \.vell established in the Nile Va lley a:: soon came to replace the old religion of tlgods. Doubtless the spread of the religion \\7...... aided by the fact that many aspects of Chri~ tianity \-Vere readily understandable to t!' Egyptians in terms of their own ancient myfr-.. and beliefs, not least the role of Jesus as thes
of God. As has been pointed out, the fact ththe Egyptians, since ancient times, had vie,\·t" their king as the incarnate son of a god, rnea.:
that the Christian concept of Jesus as ::
incarnate Son of God \vas far n1ore reaci embraced in Egypt than else\.vhere in : Roman world. The iconography of Christianity - preciSt" because it encountered the Egyptian dei ties

an early and formative period in its development \Vas particularly affected. Often the gods are in the details. The four evangelists of the Christian tradition vvere frequently depicted in anin1al form or as animal-headed like the Egyptian gods in early Christian art, and the precursor of the St. George and the Dragon motif may possibly be first found in H.ibis Temple. But even rnajor Christian motifs may have Egyptian origins.The sacred mother and child of Christianity are certainly foreshado\\1ed in the countless images of Isis (vvhom the Egyptians called thernut-netcher-the 'mother of god') and her infant son Horus, as is even the symbol of the cross (\vhich is first attested in Egypt as the 'Egyptian' or tau cross - a form of the ankh sign). It has also been suggested that scenes from the Egyptian underworld books which graphically depict the fate of the damned inspired much of the later iconography of the Christian hell \:vith its demons and punishment~ and it is probably impossible to knovv the full extent to vvhich such pagan revenants have influenced the imagery of Christianity. Other later religions and even secular philosphies have likevvise been affected by the deities of Egypt. Greek accounts of Egyptian myths continued to influence Western cultures during the Niedieval and Renaissance Periods. The philosophy of NeoPlatonism and various forms of the Hermetic mysteries all contained ideas which were essentially Egyptian, and as late as the 17th century, the German Jesuit-scholar Athanasius Kircher argued that the goddess Isis vvas an emanation of the queen
of heaven of Roman Catholic belief. Even today, in the 21st century: many of Egypt's gods and religious syn1bols continue to exist sometimes unbekno\vn to their perpetuators and sometimes knowingly. Throughout the Mediterranean sailors still paint an eye on the prow of their boats for protection and to 'see' their way ahead vvithout realizing they continue a custom begun by the ancient Egyptians with the Eye of Horus (see
p. 200). In Egypt, local women desiring to have children still occasionally visit the crypts of Hathor's Temple, as that goddess retains a reputation for granting fertility almost t\VO millennia after her cult was overthro,vn. There is also a vast modern interest in ancient Egypt \-vhich often focuses on the civilization's gods and goddesses - ranging from the detached study of scholars of comparative religion to the fervent efforts of latter day pagans \.vho desire to resurrect the ancient cults. The legacy of the gods is to be found in an amazing nurnber of places and \Vith ongoing reinterpretations, for the influence of Egypt's deities has far outlived the ancient civilization \vith a persistence which - viewed historically - may outlast our ovvn.
