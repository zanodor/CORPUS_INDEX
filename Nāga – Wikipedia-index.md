In Sanskrit, a nāgá (नाग) is a cobra, the Indian cobra (Naja naja). A synonym for
nāgá is phaṇin (फिणन्). There are several words for "snake" in general, and one of
the very commonly used ones is sarpá (सप). Sometimes the word nāgá is also used
generically to mean "snake".[2] The word is cognate with English 'snake', Germanic:
*snēk-a-, Proto-IE: *(s)nēg-o- (withs-mobile).[3]
In the great epic Mahabharata, the depiction of nagas tends toward the negative. The
epic calls them "persecutors of all creatures", and tells us "the snakes were of
virulent poison, great prowess and excess of strength, and ever bent on biting other
creatures" (Book I: Adi Parva, Section 20). At some points within the story, nagas

are important players in many of the events narrated in the epic, frequently no more
evil nor deceitful than the other
protagonists, and sometimes on the side of
good.
The epic frequently characterizes nagas as
having a mixture of human and serpent
like traits. Sometimes it characterizes them
as having human traits at one time, and as
having serpent-like traits at another. For
example, the story of how the naga prince
Shesha came to hold the world on his head
begins with a scene in which he appears as
a dedicated human ascetic, "with knotted hair, clad in rags, and his flesh, skin, and sinews dried up owing to the hard penances he
was practising." Brahma is pleased with Shesha, and entrusts him with the duty of carrying the world. At that point in the story,
Shesha begins to exhibit the attributes of a serpent. He enters into a hole in the Earth and slithers all the way to bottom, where he then
loads the Earth onto his head. (Book I: Adi Parva, Section 36.)
The great nemesis of the nagas in the Mahabharata is the gigantic eagle-kingGaruda. Garuda and the nagas began life as cousins. The
sage Kashyapa had two wives (amongst his 13 wives, all prajapati Daksha's daughters), Kadru and Vinata, the former of whom
desired many offspring, and the latter of whom desired few but powerful offspring. Each got her wish. Kadru laid 1000 eggs which
hatched into snakes, and Vinata laid two, which hatched into the charioteer of Surya the sun god and Garuda. Through a foolish bet,
Vinata became enslaved to her sister, and as a result Vinata's son Garuda was required to do the bidding of the snakes. Though
compliant, he chafed and built up a grudge that he would never relinquish. When he asked the snakes what he would have to do in
order to release his mother, Vinata, from her bondage, they told him he would have to bring them amrita, the elixir of immortality.
Garuda stole the elixir from the gods and brought it to the serpents in fulfillment of their requirement, but through a ruse prevented
them from partaking of it and achieving immortality. From that point onward, he regarded them as enemies and as food. (Book I: Adi
Parva, Sections 16ff.)
Kadru, the ancestral mother of snakes, made a bet with her sister Vinata, the stakes being that the loser would be enslaved to the
winner. Eager to secure victory, Kadru requested the cooperation of her offspring in order to fix the bet so that Kadru would win.
When her offspring balked at the request, Kadru grew angry and cursed them to die a fiery death in the snake-sacrifice of King
Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, who was the son of Abhimanyu the son of Arjuna. The king of the snakes Vasuki was aware of the
curse, and knew that his brethren would need a hero to rescue them from it. He approached the renowned ascetic Jaratkaru with a
proposal of marriage to a snake-goddess, Manasa, Vasuki's own sister. Out of the union of the ascetic and the snake-maiden was born
"a son of the splendor of a celestial child." This son was namedAstika, and he was to be the savior of the snakes.
In accordance with Kadru's curse, Janamejaya prepared a snake sacrifice of a type described in the scriptures, the Puranas. He erected
a sacrificial platform and hired priests and other professionals needed for the rites. Following the proper form, the priests lit the
sacrificial fire, duly fed it with clarified butter, uttered the requiredmantras, and began calling the names of snakes. The power of the
rite was such that the named snakes were summoned to the fire and were consumed by it. As the sacrifice took on genocidal
proportions, Astika came to the rescue. He approached Janamejaya and praised the sacrifice in such eloquent terms that the king
offered to grant him a boon of his choosing. Astika promptly requested that the sacrifice be terminated. Though initially regretful of
his offer, Janamejaya was true to his word, and the sacrifice came to an end. (Book I: Adi Parva, Sections 13-58.)

Stories involving the nāgas are still very much a part of contemporary cultural traditions in
predominantly Hindu regions of Asia (India, Nepal, and the island of Bali). In India, nāgas are
considered nature spirits and the protectors of springs, wells and rivers. They bring rain, and
thus fertility, but are also thought to bring disasters such as floods and drought.
Nagas are snakes that may take human form. They tend to be very curious. According to
traditions nāgas are only malevolent to humans when they have been mistreated. They are
susceptible to mankind's disrespectful actions in relation to the environment. They are also
associated with waters—rivers, lakes, seas, and wells—and are generally regarded as
guardians of treasure.
They are objects of great reverence in some parts of South India, where it is believed that they
bring fertility and prosperity to their venerators. Expensive and grand rituals like the
nagamandala[4] and the Nāgārādhane are conducted in their hono.r
Another example comes from South India. Women gather at Hindu temples to worship nāgas
(considered snake goddesses in south Indian Hinduism). At the temples, the nāgas take the
form of snakes carved into stones. Hindu women gather around the stones to make offerings
to the female snake goddesses. These goddesses are believed to make women fertile, protect
the women and her family, and bring prosperity. The snake goddess is represented as an anthill
or a snake that lives inside an anthill or stones with snake carvings on them. In each form,
women of South India honor the nāgas with offerings. Hindus believe a person who harms or
kills a snake will be inflicted with a condition known as nāga dösam which causes infertility
and delays in marriage. Nāga dösam can only be reversed through varying degrees of worship
to nāga.[5]
A third example comes from certain communities called Nāgavanśī, including the Nairs of
Kerala and the ethnically related Jain Bunts of Karnataka. These communities trace their
ancestry to nāgas.
Nagas are also worshipped in the Dug Nakuri region of Kumaon region of Uttarakhand.
Nakuri (from Nagpuri or city of nagas) corresponds to the town of Berinag and is home to
many temples devoted to Nagas namely Dhaulinag (Dhavalnag), Kalinag (Kaliyanag),
Feninag (Faninag), Bashukinag (Vasukinag), Pinglenag & Harinag[.6][7]
Nagas live in Pātāla, the seventh of the nether dimensions or realms.[8] They are the children
of Kashyapa and Kadru. Among the prominent nāgas of Hinduism areManasa, the nagaraja or
King of the nāgasŚeṣa and Vasuki.
Nagas also carry the elixir of life and immortality. Garuda once brought it to them and put a cup with elixir on kusha grass but it was
taken away by Indra. The nāgas licked the kusha grass, but in doing so cut their tongues on the grass, and since then their tongues
have been forked.[9]
Vishnu is originally portrayed in the form sheltered by a Śeṣanāga or reclining on Śeṣa, but the iconography has been extended to
other deities as well. The serpent is a common feature in Ganesha iconography and appears in many forms: around the neck,[10] use
as a sacred thread (Sanskrit: yajñyopavīta)[11] wrapped around the stomach as a belt, held in a hand, coiled at the ankles, or as a
throne.[12] Shiva is often shown garlanded with a snake.[13] Maehle (2006: p. 297) states that "Patanjali is thought to be a
manifestation of the serpent of eternity".

Traditions about nāgas are also very
common in all the Buddhist
countries of Asia. In many
countries, the nāga concept has
been merged with local traditions of
great and wise serpents or dragons
such as the Burmese nat (Burmese:
နတ်; MLCTS: IPA: [naʔ]). In
Tibetan religion, the nāga was
equated with the klu (Tibetan: ་)
that dwell in lakes or underground
streams and guard treasure. In
China, the nāga was equated with
the Chinese dragon (Chinese: 龍 ;
pinyin: lóng).
The Buddhist nāga generally has the form of a great cobra, usually with a single
head but sometimes with many. At least some of the nāgas are capable of using
magic powers to transform themselves into a human semblance. In Buddhist
painting, the nāga is sometimes portrayed as a human being with a snake or dragon extending over his head.[14] One nāga, in human
form, attempted to become a monk; when telling it that such ordination was impossible, the Buddha told it how to ensure that it
would be reborn a human, able to become a monk[.15]
In the "Devadatta" chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the daughter of the dragon king, an eight-year
old longnü (nāga), after listening to Mañjuśrī preach the Lotus Sutra, transforms into a male
Bodhisattva and immediately reaches full enlightenment.[16][17][18] This tale appears to
reinforce the viewpoint prevalent in Mahayana scriptures that a male body is required for
Buddhahood, even if a being is so advanced in realization that they can magically transform
their body at will and demonstrate the emptiness of the physical form itsel[f1.9]
Nagas are believed to both live on Mount Meru, among the other minor deities, and in various
parts of the human-inhabited earth. Some of them are water-dwellers, living in streams or the
ocean; others are earth-dwellers, living in undegrround caverns.
The nāgas are the servants of Virūpākṣa (Pāli: Virūpakkha), one of the Four Heavenly Kings
who guards the western direction. They act as a guard upon Mount Sumeru, protecting the
dēvas of Trāyastriṃśa from attack by theasūras.
Among the notable nāgas of Buddhist tradition is Mucalinda, Nāgarāja and protector of the
Buddha. In the Vinaya Sutra (I, 3), shortly after his enlightenment, the Buddha is meditating
in a forest when a great storm arises, but graciously, King Mucalinda gives shelter to the
Buddha from the storm by covering the Buddha's head with his seven snake heads.[20] Then
the king takes the form of a youngBrahmin and renders the Buddha homage[.20]
It is noteworthy that the two chief disciples of the Buddha, Sariputta and Moggallāna are both referred to as Mahānāga or "Great
Nāga".[21] Some of the most important figures in Buddhist history symbolize nagas in their names such as Dignāga, Nāgāsēna, and,
although other etymons are assigned to his name,Nāgārjuna.
In the Vajrayāna and Mahāsiddha traditions,[22] nagas in their half-human form are depicted holding a naga-jewel, kumbhas of
amrita, or a terma that had been elementally encoded by adepts.

According to tradition, Prajñapāramita sutras had been given by the Buddha to a great Naga who guarded them in the sea, and were
conferred upon Nāgārjuna late.r[23][24]
For Malay sailors, nāgas are a type of dragon with many heads; inThailand and Java, the nāga
is a wealthy underworld deity. In Laos they are beaked water serpents.
Eight dragon kings who assembled at the gathering where Shakyamuni preached the Lotus
Sutra, as described in the sutra. Kumarajiva's translation of the Lotus Sutra refers to them by
their Sanskrit names:
Nanda, Upananda, Sagara, Vasuki , Takshaka , Anavatapta, Manasvin, and Utpalaka.
According to the "Introduction" (first) chapter of the Lotus Sutra, each attends the gathering
accompanied by several hundreds of thousands of follower[s2.5]
In Thailand, nagas figure in some stories of the Thai folklore and are represented as well in wats as architectural elements. Phaya
Naga is a well-known naga said to live in the Mekong. The Thai television soap opera Manisawat (Thai: มณีสวาท) is based on a
naga legend.[26] In the Thai zodiac of the Thai lunar calendar which is based on the Buddhist lunisolar calendar, the dragon is often
depicted as a naga.[27]
In Malay and Orang Asli traditions, the lake Chini, located in Pahang is home to a naga called Sri Gumum. Depending on legend
versions, her predecessor Sri Pahang or her son left the lake and later fought a naga called Sri Kemboja. Kemboja is the former name
of what is Cambodia. Like the naga legends there, there are stories about an ancient empire in lake Chini, although the stories are not
linked to the naga legends[.28][29]
In a Cambodian legend, the nāga were a reptilian race of beings under the King Kaliya who possessed a large empire or kingdom in
the Pacific Ocean region until they were chased away by theGaruda and sought refuge in India. It was here Kaliya's daughter married
an Indian Brahmana named Kaundinya, and from their union sprang the Cambodian people. Therefore, Cambodians possess a slogan
"Born from the naga". As adowry, Kaliya drank up the water that covered the country and exposed the land for his daughter and son
in-law to inhabit and thus, Cambodia was created.
The seven-headed nagas depicted as statues on Cambodian temples such as Angkor Wat, apparently represent the seven races within
naga society, which has a mythological, or symbolic, association with "the seven colors of the rainbow". Furthermore, Cambodian
naga possess numerological symbolism in the number of their heads. Odd-headed naga symbolise the Male Energy, Infinity,
Timelessness, and Immortality. This is because, numerologically, all odd numbers come from One (1). Even-headed naga are said to
be "Female, representing Physicalit,yMortality, Temporality, and the Earth."

Naga are believed to live in the Laotian stretch of the Mekong or its estuaries. Lao mythology
maintains that the naga are the protectors of Vientiane, and by extension, the Lao state. The
naga association was most clearly articulated during and immediately after the reign of
Anouvong. An important poem from this period San Leupphasun(Lao: ສານລຶພສູນ) discusses
relations between Laos and Thailand in a veiled manner, using the naga and the garuda to
represent the Lao and the Thai, respectively.[30] The naga is incorporated extensively into Lao
iconography, and features prominently in Lao culture throughout the length of the country, not
only in Vientiane.
In Javanese and Balinese culture, Indonesia, a Naga is depicted as a crowned giant magical
serpent, sometimes winged. It is similarly derived from the Shiva-Hinduism tradition, merged
with Javanese animism. Naga in Indonesia mainly derived and influenced by Indic tradition of
Naga serpent, combined with native animism
tradition of sacred serpent.
The early depiction circa 9th century Central
Java closely resembled Indic Naga which
was based on cobra imagery. The later
depiction since the 15th century however,
was slightly influenced by Chinese dragon
imagery, although unlike its Chinese
counterparts, Javanese and Balinese nagas do
not have legs. The concept of Naga is
prevalent in the Hindu period of Indonesia,
before the introduction of Islam. It is usually linked as the lesser deity of earth and water. In a
wayang theater story a snake (naga) god named Sanghyang Anantaboga or Antaboga is a
guardian deity in the bowels of the earth.[31][32] Naga symbolize the nether realm of earth or
underworld.
In many parts of pre-Hispanic Philippines, the naga is used as an ornament in the hilt ends of longswords locally known as
kampilans.

Several Bollywood films have been made about female nāgas, includingNagin (1954), Nagin (1976), Nagina (1986), Nigahen (1989), Jaani Dushman: Ek
Anokhi Kahani (2002), Hisss (2010), and the television seriesNaaginn (20072009).
In Jungle Boy, the Naga is depicted as a largecobra deity that grants the gift of understanding all languages to those who are pure of heart and punishes those who aren't pure of heart in different ways.
The Nagas are antagonists in the cartoonThe Secret Saturdays. They served the ancient Sumerian cryptid Kur and attempted to push Zak Saturday into the dark side after learning that he was Kur reincarnated, but eventually served.VV. Argost when he gained his own Kur powers.
The Nagas appear in theWarcraft franchise. They are depicted as ancient night elves that have snake-like tails in place of legs, and have other serpentine features such as scales and fins. The Nagas came to be when they were transformed from the ancient night elves by the Old Gods.
Magic: The Gathering's 2014-2015 block, set on the plane of Tarkir, featured Naga as humanoid snakes versedin powerful venoms and poisons with two arms and no other appendages. They are aligned with the Sultai clan in the sets, Khans of Tarkir[35] and Fate Reforged,[36] and with the Silumgar clan in theDragons of Tarkir[37] set.
