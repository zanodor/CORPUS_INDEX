Mary, the Mother of Jesus and Sister of Aaron
Quran Contradiction
Sam Shamoun
The Quran confuses Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus, with Miriam
the sister of Moses. The Quran identifies Mary as the sister of Aaron,
the daughter of Imran, whose mother was the wife of Imran:
When the wife of Imran said, 'Lord, I have vowed to Thee, in
dedication, what is within my womb. Receive Thou this from me;
Thou hearest, and knowest.' And when she gave birth to her she
said, 'Lord, I have given birth to her, a female.' (And God knew
very well what she had given birth to; the male is not as the
female.) 'And I have named her Mary, and commend her to Thee
with her seed, to protect them from the accursed Satan.' S. 3K35
36 Arberry
Then she brought the child to her folk carrying him; and they said,
'Mary, thou hast surely committed a monstrous thing! Sister of
Aaron, thy father was not a wicked man, nor was thy mother a
woman unchaste.' S. 19K27-28
And Mary, Imran's daughter, who guarded her virginity, so We
breathed into her of Our Spirit, and she confirmed the Words of
her Lord and His Books, and became one of the obedient. S.
66K12
Compare this to what the Holy Bible says:
"Then Mary (Hebrew- Mariam), the prophetess, the sister of



Aaron, took the timbrel in her hand..." Exodus 15K20
"The name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi,
who was born to Levi in Egypt; and to Amram she bore Aaron and
Moses and their sister Miriam." Numbers 26K49
"The children of Amram: Aaron, Moses, and Miriam. The sons of
Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar." 1 Chronicles 6K3
"For I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you
from the house of slavery, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron,
and Miriam." Micah 6K4
"Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite
woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite
woman. And they said, ‘Has the LORD indeed spoken only
through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" And the
LORD heard it. Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all
people who were on the face of the earth. And suddenly the
LORD said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, ‘Come out, you
three, to the tent of meeting.ʼ And the three of them came out.
And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the
entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both
came forward... When the cloud removed from over the tent,
behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward
Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. And Aaron said to Moses,
‘Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly
and have sinned. Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half
eaten away when he comes out of his mother's womb.ʼ And
Moses cried to the LORD, ‘O God, please heal her--please.ʼ But
the LORD said to Moses, ‘If her father had but spit in her face,
should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut outside
the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in



again." So Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days, and the
people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in
again." Numbers 12K1-5, 10-15
It is very hard to accept the idea that the Quran wasnʼt identifying
Jesusʼ mother with the sister of Moses in light of the fact that both
these Marys had brothers named Aaron and fathers named
Imran/Amram! It is rather obvious to any unbiased reader that
Muhammad has clearly confused the identity of Jesusʼ mother with
the sister of Aaron and Moses. He mistakenly thought that the
mother of the Lord Jesus was the sister of Moses and Aaron.
Some Muslims try very hard to get around this and have sought to
refute the assertion that the Quran is mistaken:
http://bismikaallahuma.org/Quran/Contra/External/sister_of_aaron
.htm
But to no avail. The Muslim responses have been thoroughly
addressed and refuted in the following papers:
http://answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/qbhc06.html
http://answering-islam.org/Silas/mary.htm
http://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/davids_seed.htm
http://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/badawi-jesus3.htm
http://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/god.htm
What we want to do in this paper is to quote two specific narrations
from two of Islamʼs premier commentators so as to see the
confusion these Quranic statements caused for Muslims.
According to renowned Sunni Muslim commentator, Ibn Kathir, Aisha
thought that Moses was Jesusʼ maternal uncle! Aisha was convinced
that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was the actual sister of Aaron,



Mosesʼ biological brother, making the latter Christʼs maternal uncle!
And from whom would Aisha have gained this understanding that led
to her conviction, if not from Muhammad?
Here is what Ibn Kathir narrated:

It was narrated from Ibn Jarir, narrated from Yaqub, narrated from
Ibn Uʼlaya, narrated from Saʼid Ibn Abi Sadaqa, narrated from
Muhammad Ibn Sireen who stated that he was told that Kaʼb said
the verse that reads, "O sister of Harun (Aaron)!" (of Sura 19K28)
does not refer to Aaron the brother of Moses. Aisha replied to
Kaʼb, "YOU HAVE LIED." Kaʼb responded, "O Mother of the
believers! If the prophet, may Allahʼs prayers be upon him, has
said it, and he is more knowledgeable, then this is what he
related. Besides, I find the difference in time between them
(Jesus and Moses) to be 600 years." He said that she remained
silent.
(From the Arabic commentary of Ibn Kathir on Sura 19K28, online
edition; bold, underline and capital emphasis ours)
Aisha, whom Muslims claim was one of the most knowledgeable
persons of Islam, clearly understood the expression, "Sister of
Aaron," to refer to Mosesʼ brother Aaron, i.e. understanding that
Mary the mother of Jesus was the sister of Moses and Aaron, which
would make Moses Jesusʼ maternal uncle! More specifically, she
understood this phrase to be literally saying that Mary was the
actual, biological sister of Aaron, the brother of Moses. Although Kab



was wrong regarding the length of the time gap between Jesus and
Moses, he was correct to see the problem and dilemma that
Muhammadʼs words caused.
Another prominent Sunni commentator and historian named Al
Tabari narrated a hadith which is also found in our rebuttals above:

The people of commentary and interpretation have differed on
the reason why it was said "O sister of Harun!" (Of Sura 19K28),
and who this Harun was that Allah mentioned...
It was narrated by Ibn Hamid, narrated by Al Hakam Ibn Bashir,
narrated by Amr, narrated by Simak Ibn Harb, narrated by Alkama
Ibn Waʼil, narrated Al Mughira Ibn Shuʼba who said, "The prophet,
may Allahʼs prayers be upon him, sent me to fetch some of his
needs from the people of Najran who said, ‘Doesnʼt your
prophet claim that Harun the brother of Mariam (Mary) is the
brother of Moses?ʼ I did not know how to respond to them
until I returned to the prophet, may Allahʼs prayers be upon him. I
related to him all what was said and he replied, ‘They used to
name themselves after the names of those who came before
them.ʼ"
Others said the Harun referred to is the brother of Moses, and



Mariam was classified as his sister for she is a (descendent) of
(his) son.
It was narrated by Musa, narrated by Amr, narrated by Asbat,
narrated by Al Suddi who said regarding "O sister of Harun!" (Of
Sura 19K28) that (Mariam) was a descendent of the tribe of Harun,
the brother of Moses.
(From the Arabic commentary of Al-Tabari on Sura 19K28, online
edition; bold and underline emphasis ours)
Here is another instance where Arabs, people whose mother tongue
was Arabic, understood the Quranʼs statement to be saying that
Jesusʼ mother was the biological sister of Moses. So, in the Islamic
traditions themselves, we now have two witnesses supporting the
fact that Muhammad made a gross mistake: one witness who is
viewed by Muslims as one of the most knowledgeable persons, the
other witness from native Arabic speaking Christians, and both
groups understood Muhammad to be teaching that Moses was
Jesusʼ uncle!
We have already addressed the responses given by Al-Tabari (see
the above links for details), so we will only briefly address them here.
The Muslims are wrong on two counts. First, Muhammad was wrong
when he said that this is what people used when they wanted to
name themselves after those who came before them. The way
people named themselves after their predecessors wasnʼt by calling
someone a brother or a sister of so and so, but rather a son or
daughter of so and so.
The following Muslim disagrees with this position and tries to provide
an example to the contrary:
... In Semitic language the words father, mother, brother and



sister are used broadly and do not necessarily imply the very
close relations of real mother, father, brother and sister. Thus
Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said: "I am the answer of
the prayer of my father Abraham." (Bukhari)
In ancient Semitic usage, a person's name was often linked with
that of a renowned ancestor or founder of the tribal line. Thus, for
instance, a man of the tribe Banu Tamim was some times
addressed as son of Tamim or brother of Tamim. Since Mary
belonged to the priestly class and hence descended from Aaron,
she was called a sister of Aaron. In the same manner her cousin
Elizabeth, the wife of Zechariah, is spoken of in Luke 1K5, as one
of the daughters of Aaron.
Numerous are the instances in Bible where tribal names are used
to mention descendants. For example, Lot is called Abrahamʼs
brother (Genesis 14K14), though he was in fact Abraham's
nephew (Genesis 11K31). Similarly Abraham spoke to Lot saying:
"We men are brothers" (Genesis 13K8). But Abraham was actually
was the uncle of Lot! Likewise the Babylonian queen referred to
Nebuchadnezzar as the father of Belshazzar, when, Nabonidus
was evidently his father and Nebuchadnezzar his grandfather
(Daniel 5K11). Thus, in New Testament Abraham is referred to as
the father of us, when actually he was a distant forefather (Acts
7K2, Romans 4K12, James 2K21). A member of the Jewish race
removed from Abraham as much by 2000 years can still refer to
Abraham as his father (Luke 16K24-25, 1K67-73; 13K16). In
Numbers (20K14), the Israelites are referred to as the brother of
the king of Edom, even though Esau and Jacob were the brothers
from whom both groups descended. Similarly, Obed is referred to
as Naomi's son in Ruth 4K17, even though he was the son of her
daughter-in-law, Ruth. Laban is called Nahorʼs son (Genesis 49K5)
when he is actually the son of Bethuel, the son of Nahor (Genesis



4K47). Jesus in the synagogue on the Sabbath healed the woman
who had a spirit ofresponse to criticism of the healing, Jesus
referred to her as a daughter of Abraham (Luke 13K16). In the
parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus placed Lazarus on
Abrahamʼs bosom (Luke 16K22). Zacchaeus, as tax collector, was
socially alienated. The crowd murmured against Jesus' voluntary
visit to Zacchaeusʼ house. After his declaration that he would give
back to the poor half of his wealth and restore fourfold to those
he had defrauded, Jesus called him a son of Abraham (Luke
19K9).
In the longest statement recorded in the New Testament (John
8K37-59), Jesus has used Abrahamʼs children thrice. St. Paul
referred to Jesus as the offering [sic] of Abraham (Galatians 3K16
18, 24K29). Persons in authority are also known as Fathers in
Biblical language: priestly officials (Judges 17K10), Prophets (2
Kings 2K12, 6K21), Persons holding office (Genesis 45K8, Isaiah
22K21), benefactors (Job 29K16). Sometimes, families are known
after the names of their distinguished ancestors. In the Bible, the
name Israel sometimes stands for the Israelites (Deuteronomy
6K3-4) and Kedar for the Ishmaelite (Isaiah 21K16, 42K11). Jesus
was titled son of David (Matthew 9K27, 15K22, 20K30-31, Mark
10K47-48). (Source)
The author apparently didnʼt realize how all these examples actually
prove our case since they demonstrate that Muhammad made a
major blunder. In every single example that the author provided, the
word used in connection with oneʼs lineage, to descendants, isnʼt
"brother of" or "sister of" but rather "son of" or "daughter of"! Not a
single example provided by the author which refers to a personʼs
lineage ever use the expression "brother of" or "sister of."
The one example he provides where "brother of" or "brothers" is



actually used (i.e. Abraham and his nephew Lot) it refers not to
descendants but to two contemporaries! Hence, by using the
example of Abrahamʼs relation to Lot, the author has provided
indirect proof that the Quran erroneously assumes that Mary and
Aaron were contemporaries and lived at the same time!
His appeal to the Arabic is no better. When a person speaks of "a/the
brother of Tamim," what he/she is implying is that the individual in
question is a contemporary of that particular tribe, that both the tribe
and the person are living at the same time.
The second mistake made by the Muslims is to assume that Mary
was of the tribe of Aaron, i.e. a Levite from the lineage of Aaron. Both
the Holy Bible and the extra-biblical evidence show that Mary was
from the tribe of Judah, from the line of David. She had no
connection to the priestly line. Some Muslims try to appeal to the
statement made by Luke 1K36 where Mary is said to be a relative of
Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, who was from the house
of Aaron (Cf. Luke 1K5). The only thing this proves is that Elizabeth
had Judean blood from her motherʼs side, that her mother was of the
tribe of Judah, since it wasnʼt uncommon for priests to marry women
from the other Israelite tribes. Case in point:
"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of
Judah. But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash
the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king's
sons who were about to be put to death, and she put him and his
nurse in a bedroom. Thus Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King
Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was a
sister of Ahaziah, hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not put
him to death." 2 Chronicles 22K10-11



Jehoram was the King of Judah and from the line of David, making
his daughter a descendant of David. She was married to the Aaronic
high priest, proving that priests could marry women from the
brethren tribes of Levi. For a more detailed discussion of this
argument, see the links provided above as well as this article.
As it stands, all the evidence conclusively shows that the Quran
contains a gross mistake since it erroneously teaches that the
mother of Christ was the biological sister and contemporary of Aaron
the high priest, making Moses Jesusʼ uncle!
