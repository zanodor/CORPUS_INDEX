Dogs in Chinese Culture and Art from Antiquity to Marco Polo
Pekingese Dog from an Imperial Dog Book by an unknown Painter (Collier)
Any modern scholarship of Chinese dogs must depend heavily on
two sources, V.W.F. Collierʼs Dogs of China and Japan in Nature and
Art and Berthold Lauferʼs Chinese Pottery of the Han Dynasty.
Lauferʼs book belongs in the category of art history, but when he
finds that naturalists have missed the significance of a number of
relics of the Han Dynasty, which lasted from the end of the third
century BC into the early first century, he goes beyond his primary
expertise and, very profitably for future dog historians, advances
arguments about the shape and uses of dogs in the period. This
blog is largely a summary of these two authors, with a few additional



notes on subsequent findings.
The functions of dogs in China were not detailed until the Han
Dynasty, though the wisdom and sayings sources that sometimes go
back to the end of the second millennium BC do give solid
information about the functions of dogs in earlier periods. Imperial
households were often the repositories of the most valuable dogs for
each function except being eaten, though even here medicinal uses,
and probably religious feasts, involved sacrificing and eating parts of
dogs. The restriction of the Pekingese dog to the imperial
household was a matter too recent for this blog, but is no more than
an exaggeration of the rights of the highest nobility of earlier times.
Domestication
A Chinese dictionary, the Erh Ya, datable several centuries BC, says
that the wolf has the feet of a dog, and a later source, the Shuo wen
(c. 100 AD) says that the wolf has the voice of the dog. A natural
history compiled in 1769 from earlier sources, Mao shih ming wu tʼu
shuo, shows the dog and the wolf as having a striking resemblance.

In considering that domestication of dogs may have first occurred in
China (Savolainen et al., 2002), it is worth analyzing what sort of dog
cultures existed in historical times. By the Han period it is clear that



there were a number of functions of dogs—hunting, guarding, being
eaten, living in houses, as well as a number of morphological types
sighthounds, or at least sighthound-like dogs, mastiff-like dogs, and
small dogs, some with pricked ears, some with lop ears. Breeding
for color and markings was important early, given that certain
features were regarded as bringing good fortune, while others might
bring evil.
Were Dogs Imported from Tibet or Turkestan?
Importation of large tracking and guard dogs from Tibet in the 12th
century BC was argued by a number of German scholars but
disputed by Collier and Laufer. The German scholarship on this is
related to the belief that large dogs in India and Assyria had their
origin in Tibet. Laufer notes that there are comparatively few
references to dogs in pre-Han Dynasty literature, and that most are
“stories about dogs, dog-spirits, monstrosities, etc., interesting
contributions partially to the psychology of the dog, partially to the
psychology of the Chinese in their relations with dogs, and valuable
folk-lore material.” Laufer concludes that the statement of Albrecht
(1903) “that the dog is altogether a foreign import in China, is
unfounded, and lacks historical basis.” Laufer accepts the possibility
that some Tibetan dogs reached China in the Mongol period, but
that such importation as occurred was probably mediated through
Mongolia.
An emperor of the Chou Dynasty received “ao” dogs as tribute,
which Collier considers may have been a type of black mastiff,
though he also refers to it as a bloodhound. The Erh Ya states that
the character ao was the name of a type of dog that was four feet
high. The ao dogs received as tribute may have come, according to
Laufer, from a Turkish tribe to the west of the provinces that then
composed China.



Collier notes a passage in the Tso chuan stating that, to certain
presumably Turkish tribes, the wolf was not dreaded and was
accustomed to live near human dwellings. He cites the scholar of
the Tibetan language, Heinrich Jäschke, as reporting that Tibetan
wolves cause ravages among sheep, but are otherwise not much
dreaded by men, who may easily tame them. Collier believes that
mastiffs were “trained” from wolves by Turkish tribes and notes that
dogs played an eminent role in Turkish tribal traditions and creation
myths. Laufer notes a connection between dogs and Huns: “It is
noteworthy, too, that, according to the dictionary Shuo wen (c. 100
AD), the land of the Hsiung nu (Huns) possessed a special kind of
dog, called chiao, with large mouth and black body, which
characteristics are essential to the mastiff.”
Early Depictions of Dogs



Bronze tazza (Laufer)
Collier (1921) takes as the earliest depiction of Chinese dogs a
bronze tazza (dish mounted on a stem) described by Laufer (1909).
The tazza shows a hundred figures, which Collier acknowledges as
having artistic value but finds “imaginative and probably defective as
accurate representations of the dogs of the period.” There are
probably three types of dogs on the piece: “one, diminutive, short
tailed, with erect ears; another, long-bodied and long-tailed, long



legged, also with erect ears; and a third of sturdier build, also long
tailed, and with erect ears.”
The item, which Laufer dates to the Chou Dynasty (I cannot find a
more specific date but presume it is most likely from the 4th or 3rd
century BC) is depicted in a work entitled the Hsi ch'ing ku chien. He
elaborates:
“Its height, according to the text (the measurements being
recalculated from the statements in Chinese feet), is 24.4 cm; its
depth, 10.8 cm; the circumference of the mouth I9.2 cm, that of the
foot I2.4 cm; and its weight, 63 ounces. No further description is
given in the ‘Hsi ch'ing ku chien.ʼ This bronze vessel is defined as a
‘tou with a hundred animalsʼ (pai shou tou), from the representation
of a number of animals and hunting-scenes engraved on it. In this
respect it is of primary importance for the study of the reliefs on the
Han pottery. It shows, first of all, that the representation of animals,
and particularly animals in motion, was a favorite subject of earliest
Chinese art, and that it had already adopted at that time a fixed,
stereotyped, conventionalized expression. Two typical scenes, which
are several times repeated, represent especially the prototype and
exact counterpart of a type frequently occurring on the Han reliefs.
For brevity's sake we might define these scenes as ‘the hunter and
the animal [prey].ʼ"
Look carefully towards the left near the top rim where a letter “a”
and a dotted line connects a hunter holding a spear in his left hand,
as if to ward off a large but not clearly identifiable animal. Another
hunting scene towards the right edge is also labeled “a” but here the
hunter prepares to thrust the spear towards the animalʼs mouth.
Laufer argues that the lack of detail on the face makes it possible



that the being is a demon or deified hero. In the scene surrounding
the letter “b”, a dog is leaping towards the hunter who raises a fist
towards a humanoid figure with an animalʼs head. The animals
marked “c” are said by Laufer to be tapirs.
Laufer believes this particular tazza disproves Bushellʼs statement
that the human figure never occurs in primitive bronzes, though
Bushell (1904) is generally correct in characterizing artists of the
period as reveling in a mythological zoology ... peopled with dragons,
unicorns, phoenixes, and hoary tortoises.” Bushell (1904) was aware
of animal depictions, referring to a dog in a large stone relief of the
Han period (one of those reproduced also by Chavannes).
Painted Shell of Chase (Lee)
Painted shells that were dated by Sherman Lee (1957) most likely to
the 3rd century BC (late Chou period) show two hounds below a
chariot drawn by four horses. Two men are on the chariot, one of
whom holds a bow and arrow. Lee describes the hounds as running
at a “flying gallop.” The chariot is chasing a doe and a tiger. On the
lower register of the shell, another chariot pursues a large doe and a



smaller animal, a fawn or rabbit.
Dogs of the greyhound type are found as early as the Han period in
depictions, including a rubbing from a bas-relief found in Shantung
Province reproduced by Chavannes, shown below. The dog sits
before the chariot, its head turned towards the viewer, a calm
contrast to the horse behind it.
Pope-Hennessy (1923) considers a yellow-green jade from the Han
Dynasty or later to perhaps be a depiction of a sleigh dog puppy with
a bird of the parrot type on its back. She argues that dogs are not
usually depicted in jade until the Tʼang period.
Significance of Markings
Collier notes:
“The breeding of dogs possessed another incentive to the early
Chinese, not known to the inhabitants of the West, for in China
considerable importance was attached, on superstitious grounds, to
the colour and markings bred in dogs. Fortunate marking might
bring honour to a family and to its ancestors. This superstitious
belief was encouraged, if not originated, by geomancy or ‘Feng
Shui.ʼ ... The appearance of certain markings, such as a black or
yellow coat in conjunction with a white head, or two white forelegs in
a black dog, was hailed as sure presage of official appointment.... To
the Chinese, saturated with superstition, folk-lore and literary myths,
every colour has a value, and every marking serves to crystallize
some imaginative thought which can convey little to the foreigner
ignorant of Chinese underlying thought.”



Greyhound Sitting Before Horse (Chavannes)
Perhaps not prevalent in the West, such superstitions nevertheless
existed among the Babylonians, as noted by Handcock (1912), who,
despite the little that is known about breeds of dogs of the Assyrians
and Babylonians, states that “we at all events know, that they were
acquainted with dogs of various colours, for they derived omens
from piebald dogs, yellow dogs, black dogs, white dogs and the
rest.”
Collier quotes the Book of the Five Elements, as providing the results
of having dogs with certain markings:
“A black dog with white ears, he shall become rich and noble.
A white dog with a yellow head, his family will become prosperous.
A yellow dog with white tail, his family shall have officials in it in every
generation.
A black dog with white fore-legs, many male children will be born to
the family.
A yellow dog with white fore-legs, he will have good luck.



Sleigh Dog Puppy (Pope-Hennessy)
The breeding of a white dog with a black head is lucky, and will bring
a man riches.
A white dog with a black tail will cause the family through all
generations to ride in chariots.”
Breeding for markings and color was also found in early China with
regard to pigeons, goldfish, and cats.
The appearance of dogs
distinguished them more than
their functions in China. Collier
notes that dogs of the chow
type were used in China for
hunting deer, shooting
pheasants, guarding,
production of fur, eating, and
pulling sleds. The name of the
dog may have originally meant
nothing more than the Chinese
dog most commonly found in
Canton. It must be noted that
in many cultures coat colors of
pets influence perceptions
about animal personality. (See
Delgado et al. 2012.)
Imperial Dogs
References to early emperors suggest they were often enamored of
hunting and that tribute involved obtaining hunting dogs. Collier
accepts such canine tribute as possibly occurring as early as 1760
BC. Another early source from about 1000 BC refers to “short dogs”
being received from South China. The Emperor Fei Ti (973-977 AD)



of the Southern Song Dynasty was said to have stolen dogs from his
subjects (for which Collier cites Yu Pi Tʼung Chʼien).
Laufer states that the Emperor Chou Hsin (whose rule he dates from
1154 to 1123 BC) of the Shang (Yin) Dynasty, was said to have a
great number of dogs. Collier speculates that breeding of the dogs in
the imperial household was controlled more by eunuchs than by the
emperor and his consort. “Each Emperor caused illustrations of his
favourite dogs to be made by the Court painters in books or on
scrolls, and in this way was set the current fashion of breeding.” It
was high praise to say that a dog could “go into the book,” i.e., the
imperial dog book of the time. Such imperial dog books as have
been recovered consist mostly of Pekingese, Shih-tzus, and pugs.
Hunting Dogs
The Book of Rites, which Collier dates to the 7th century BC, states:
“At audiences let no reference be made to matters pertaining to the
dog and the horse.” A Sung dynasty commentary (c. 1000 AD)
concludes that this was because hunting was too unimportant to
take up the emperorʼs time, but perhaps it was so important to him
that everything else would be forgotten. Erh Ya says that following a
dayʼs hunting, one kind of dog followed the masterʼs chariot, while
“those having short mouths were carried in the carts.”



Dog Chasing Boar (Collier)
It is to be noted that even in the Chou period, hunting was not always
conducted in open wilderness, but often in confined preserves.
Schafer (1968) describes a Chou king, after taking the throne in 675
AD, seizing a private orchard to be an animal preserve for his own
use. Feudal states had their own parks and preserves, independent
of the royal ones. In the third century BC, the Supreme Forest, which
Schafer calls a “mega-park” was created south of the Wei River.
Such preserves have analogies in Europe.
Following the pre-Han tazza discussed above, Laufer reproduces a
semi-circular relief band from a Han vase showing on each side a
hunt divided into four separate stages, which Laufer has numbered
in sequence. In each sequence, a single dog chases a single boar,
their angles reflecting their response to the terrain. The flatter the
dog is shown the faster it is running and the scenes provide almost a
moving picture of the two hunts. Although Laufer calls the dogs
greyhounds, Collier disagrees as “the tail of the conventional



representation is thick, and the body too sturdy for such a breed,
which, moreover, would be a type light for the hunting of game of
such weight as the boar.” Another relief not reproduced here shows
a hunter on horseback above a dog, which Laufer labels a greyhound
pursuing a hare, but again Collier says the animal has too thick a
neck, too sturdy a body, and two broad a tail to be a greyhound.
A different type of hunting dog is seen in a relief band where three
short-legged terrier-like dogs surround what Laufer calls a man on a
hydra, his left foot raised. Laufer argues that these depictions
establish “that pursuit of the tiger, the wild-boar, the deer, and of the
hare with dogs was a pastime current among the ancient Chinese.
The breeds in use were, no doubt, adapted to some extent to
counter the ferocity, strength, speed, and elusive powers of each
quarry respectively in a land which was gradually being denuded of
forests and entering a state of close cultivation.”



Relief Band on Vase (Laufer)
A Han bas-relief indicates that falconry had entered China by the
Han Dynasty, probably from the Turkish tribes on the steppes of
Central Asia. Dogs and falcons were used simultaneously in hunts.
Some dogs clearly fit the sighthound form and have been labeled
greyhounds by many scholars, including Chavannes and Laufer.
Dogs with similar forms are found in China today, as shown by



Collierʼs photograph of Kansu greyhounds at the end of this piece.
Guard and Attack Dogs
Collier states that “fierce dogs of large size existed in China in early
times” as proven by discoveries of pottery figures of guard dogs in
graves of the Han period. Laufer accepts that the purpose of such
tomb dogs was “doubtless to guard their masters, and keep off from
their graves the evil influences of obnoxious spirits.” The figures, as
with the Han pottery mastiff shown below, sometimes had a massive
collar and body-straps, which Collier describes as a harness by
which Chinese were accustomed to hold their more powerful dogs
on leash. He speculates:
“It may be that these pottery tomb-dogs are the representatives of
dogs which were in the possession of the deceased, and that at an
earlier period the dogs themselves were slaughtered that they might
accompany their masterʼs spirit in its journey.”
Short-legged Dogs Surrounding Figure on Hydra (Laufer)
Collier describes this as a “leading-harness,” perhaps “to provide a



guide for the spirit through the darkness of the future existence.” He
also notes that a similar harness “may be seen on dogs leading the
blind in China at the present day.”
Another Han bas-relief (below) described by Chavannes shows Duke
Ling seated sending his dog against TʼI Mi-ming, who attempts to
meet it with a kick. Chavannes relates this to an historical incident
where a dog attacked an enemy of its master, but was killed by the
enemy, TʼI Mi-ming. The dog need not necessarily have been bred or
trained for guarding, since such behavior is natural even to dogs that
are not a significant threat to anyone.
House Dogs
Collier quotes Confucius:
“I have heard that the discarded hangings of the chariot may be
used to wrap the beloved saddle-horse for burial, and that the torn
awning (or chariot umbrella) will serve to cover the dear house-dog
in his grave.” (citing Li Chi. Pan Kung)
Father Navarette, writing in the 17th century, claims that among the
ancient Chinese, “Frighting the dog in the Husbandʼs presence was a
sufficient Cause it seems to discard the Wife; nor was it requisite to
this effect that any Person should be acquainted with her failing.”
The priest also describes dogʼs bread as of a type distinct from other
breads.
By the 1st century AD, sources speak of dogs called “Pai,” which
Collier says were explained by later authorities as referring to small,
short-legged and short-headed dogs that belonged under the table.
(“Kwong Yun” by Chʼen, and “Shuo wen” of Hsu Shen) Collier notes
that tables at the time were low, those at them sitting on mats, so the
dogs had to be very small.



Hunters with Dogs and Nets (Laufer Grave
Sculptures and drawing from Tresors d'Art Chinois)
The official history of the Han Dynasty, according to Collier, records
that the Emperor Ling Ti kept in his Western Garden at Lo Yang
(Honanfu) a dog of which he was extremely fond, and to this animal
he gave the official hat of the Chin Hsien grade—the most important
literary rank of the period—as well as an official belt. The hat was
83⁄4 inches high in front, 33⁄4 inches high behind, and 10 inches
broad.”
Citing a work from AD 1319 (Tunk Kʼao by Ma Tuan Lin of the Yuan
Dynasty), Collier says:
“Nearly all the dogs which were reared by the Emperor were given
the rank of Kʼai Fu (approximately that of a Viceroy); others that of Yi
Tung (a rank probably equivalent to the present post of Imperial
Guardian). The females were given the ranks of the wives of the
corresponding officials. These dogs were guarded by soldiers and
fed on the best rice and meat. For their beds they were given the
choicest carpets.”



Small Dogs
Small dogs have been found in prehistoric sites in China. (Shigehara
et al., 1998)
Development of dogs was, in a process not unlike foot-binding,
sometimes arrested by enveloping a puppy in a wire cage closely
fitting to the body, which was not removed until maturity. The nose
might be massaged daily “with the object of restraining growth of
the obstinate organ, which, only too often in Peking, appears to be
but little stunted by this persistent snubbing.”
A particular objective of breeding of small dogs for the imperial
household is connected with the Chinese interest in lions after
Buddhism reached China from India. “There is little doubt,” Collier
says, “that the lion has never existed in the wild state in China.” Yet
it took on an importance equal to that of the tiger, which is found
there, and duplicating the appearance of the lion became an
objective of dog breeding.
The first importation of lions from Parthia occurred in AD 87.
Nevertheless, most depictions were inaccurate, often fanciful, as
was realized by the Chinese traveler, Sung Yun when, in AD 518, he
saw two young lions at the Court of Gandhára. (Yule's commentary
on Marco Polo) Laufer considers that lion figures in art were adapted
by Chinese artists from Scythian and Siberan representations that
came to their attention. Collier says: “Both Tibetans and Chinese
have no doubt bred a race of toy-dogs to resemble as closely as
possible their respective ideas of the spirit-lion.”
Various associations between lions and dogs can be documented in
many cultures. Collier notes that in Shantung the natives call the
small lion figures that guard the roof-corners of all Chinese temples,
and which date from the Tʼang period, hai pah kou (small sea dogs).



These dogs, denizens of the deep, can protect buildings against
fire.
Han Pottery Mastiff (Laufer)
Collier accepts that an overland caravan route connecting China with
the west in trade was established by the Han Dynasty, and argues
that pet dogs could have been carried as items of trade. Turks used
dogs for hunting and their women “prized and reared Maltese dogs.”
He quotes San Juo Tien Lueh of the Tʼang Dynasty as reporting of
the Emperor Kao Wei:
“If 565 AD, the Emperor gave the name of Chʼih Hu or ‘red tigerʼ to a
certain Persian dog. He also gave it the rank and privileges of Chun
Chun (closely allied to those of a duke). The dog was fed with the
choicest meat and rice. It was granted the revenue of a Prefecture.
When the Emperor was mounted the dog rode upon a mat place in
front of the saddle.”
Being on a mat before a saddle meant it was small. Sources
concerning the Tʼang Dynasty report that small dogs of the Emperor
Kou Tzu (618-629) could lead horses by the reins, and held torches
in their mouths to light their masterʼs way at night. Chinese literati



continued to call the small imperial dogs by the name Fo Lin,
possibly a transliteration of εις την πολιν, Greek for “into the city,”
perhaps the original of the name Stambul. Collier considers it “more
than possible that Fu Lin dogs were of the ‘Malteseʼ race.” As
discussed in a prior blog, Maltese dogs were traded for medicinal
uses as well as being popular pets.
Collier says that it was in the Chʼien Lung period (1736-1796) that
the Chinese began to call certain small dogs Peiching Kou, i.e.,
Pekingese. “The cult of the lap-dog in China appears to have
reached its chief development during the Tao Kuang (1821-1851)
period.” The first authentic importation into England took place in
1860.
Edible Dogs
Marco Polo, as noted in a previous blog, recorded eating of dogs at
various places in China. Ibn Batuta, an Arab traveler who reached
the east in the 14th century, wrote of markets where dogs were sold
for eating. (Ibn Batutaʼs Travels, c. 1347) Fernam Mendez Pinto,
writing in the 16th century, saw pens of little dogs being sold as
meat. (Purchas, 1906, vol. 12) A representative of the East India
Company wrote that “the more ordinary sort of People will feed upon
any Carrion, either of a Horse, Mule, Ass, Dog, or any other
Creature.”(Nieuhof, Embassy from the East India Company, 1655)



Dog Defending Master (Chavannes)
Father Navarette, coming to China in 1657 and remaining for almost
20 years, called China the country of dog-eaters. His sensibilities
were not modern, however, as the following passage demonstrates:
“The Officer that carryʼd me to the Metropolis assurʼd me (and I had
it from others before) that he eat for his Breakfast every morning 30
Eggs, and a Dogʼs Leg, and drank two Quartillos (it is about a pint
and a half) of hot Wine. The good old man looked so fat and fair, it
did a man good to see him.
“Infinite number of Dogs are eaten in China, they count their flesh
delicate and nourishing, and have Butchers and Shambles where it is
soldʼ but more in the Northern Provinces than in the Southern. It is
comical to see what a multitude of dogs pursue these Butchers as
they go along the Streets; I suppose the smell of the Dogsʼ flesh they
carry about them provokes the other Dogs. When they go loaded
with half a dozen or more Dogs to the Shambles, the sport is still
better; for the noise those so carryʼd make, brings out all the Dogs in
the Town to take their parts, and attack their mortal enemyʼs. They
also eat Horse-flesh, Buffalo, Cats, and Mice; and other sorts. I



myself eat of a Horse, Dogs, and Mice, and in truth I likʼd them very
well.”
Everard Ysbrants Ides, ambassador from Moscow to China, wrote an
account of his travels in which he noted that dogs were regarded as
a healthy sort of food, particularly in summer, when it was regarded
as cooling. He records that the Tungus tribes of Siberia were
particularly fond of dogs and cats, and says that “very few of them
are found without several dead young Dogs hanging near them.”
Ides describes a gruesome ritual:
“The Waywode asked the Accuser if he would, according to the
Tunguzian Custom, put the Accused to his Oath? To this he
answered in the Affirmative; after which the accused took a live Dog,
laid him on the Ground, and with a knife stuck him in the Body, just
under his left Foot, and immediately clapped his Mouth to the
Wound, and sucked out the Dogʼs Blood so long as he could come at
it; after which he lifted him up, laid him on his shoulders, and clappʼd
his Mouth again to the Wound in order to Suck out the remaining
Blood.”
The use of dogs as food was sometimes an embarrassment to
sinophiles. Father Cibot, for instance, in remarking on the three
types of Chinese dogs—watch dogs, hunting dogs, and edible dogs
—attempted to argue that edible dogs were really otters. (Grosier,
1819) Collier debunks this, noting that otters are not common in
China, are not classed as dogs, and have no reputation as a table
delicacy. As some cities began to outlaw dog markets in the early
20th century, the poor who still ate dog meat but would try to call it
lamb.
Dog markets and dog eating continues to be found in the East,
among other places in the Korean peninsula, the Philippines, and



Indonesia. Black dogs, according to Collier, are considered to be the
most nutritious, while “flowery” dogs, those of mixed color, the most
palatable, but white or yellow dogs are the tastiest. Puppies are
fattened on rice, or other grains, and killed at about nine months.
Hair is removed by scalding and the body cut into six to eight pieces
and boiled for about an hour before being fried in oil. Meat is cut into
small pieces and cooked with dry mushrooms, preserved bean-cake,
onion, ginger, and water chestnuts. John Henry Gray (1878) says
that in Canton in the late 19th century there were about 20
restaurants specializing in serving dog and cat flesh. Dog flesh was
prohibited in Canton in 1915, but remained easily available several
years later.
Dogskin
Hosie (1904) says:
“[T]he most important branch of the skin and fur trade of Manchuria
consists of the skins of domesticated animals, the dog and the goat.
Many thousands of these skins are annually exported from
Newchwang and Tientsin, and ultimately find their way principally to
the United States.... There are thousands of small dog and goat
farms scattered over the northern districts of Manchuria and
Mongolia, where from ten to hundreds of animals are reared yearly.
When a girl is married she receives perhaps six dogs as her dowry,
and it can easily be understood that this comparatively small
beginning may be the foundation of a large fortune, seeing that the
reproduction of ten per annum would in a few years give an
enormous total. A dog matures in from six to eight months, and the
fur is at its best during winter, so that the animal must be destroyed
before the thaw sets in. Nature has provided a magnificent
protection to withstand the cold of these northern latitudes, where
the thermometer (Fahrenheit) goes down to 25° below zero ... and it



is doubtful if the dog skins in any other part of the world are to be
compared with those that come from Manchuria or Mongolia, either
in size, length of hair or quality.”
Hosie explains that the animals were killed by strangulation, as using
a knife can injure the fur. In 1896, 40,723 dog-skin mats and 28,744
dog-skin rugs were exported from Newchwang by steamer. Large
numbers of these skins entered European markets.
Dogs in Chinese Religion
Dog Sacrifice for Oath (Ides)
Pope-Hennessy (1923) summarizes an archery contest in the Chou
period (1st millennium BC) as described in the I Li, Book of
Ceremonies:
“The sacrifice of a dog or dogs is an integral part of the rites
connected with these celebrations; dogs were chosen because they
can ‘discern what men are,ʼ and discernment is necessary in judging



a contest. We must assume that the proceedings opened with the
killing of a dog, for not until the dog bouillon was cooked did the
master of ceremonies summon the principal guest. The actual
carcase of the dismembered dog was laid out on a small table or
tables, the principal guest being offered the portion of slices from
the back, the shoulder, and the lungs. The lungs also were specially
offered to the spirits, as also was wine from a cup ‘shaped like a
bird.ʼ”
The Book of Rites specified that dogs were to be boiled on the
eastern side of the courtyard "in reverential acknowledgment of the
fact that the vivifying and expanding power in nature issues from the
east." (Legge, Book of Rites)
A temple in Peking, which Collier says may date from the Tʼang
Dynasty is dedicated to the god Erh Lang, famous for exterminating
dragons. Erh Lang is also the protector of dogs. He owns a dog
which howls in the sky and eats the sun. Erh Langʼs dog became a
thin-bodied coursing dog, but as large as an elephant. Collier
attributes additional detail to a popular work on the Chinese minor
deities: “Its head is as brass and its neck as iron. Terrible in battle,
its antagonist, however fierce and powerful, is quickly consumed,
even unto the last of his bones.”
Erh Lang is considered to be the protector of the canine race. Collier
notes:
“To this day, on the first and fifteenth days of the month, native
owners of dogs may be seen worshipping at the altar of the god. If
their dogs are in danger of death they bring miniatures in clay and lay
them on his altar, so that the god may, through the presence of a
substitute, suffer the owner to keep his pet yet a little longer. It is
possible that in this may be found a survival of the old idea that not



only a curse but also a blessing pronounced upon a dummy
counterfeit has effect upon the original.”
Dogs and Death
Philippine Dog Market
Collier refers to a Buddhist practice of placing a pottery dog in a
tomb as a way of retaining the dogʼs services in the life to come. He
translates a passage from Leon Wiegerʼs Bouddhisme Chinois:
“At Stravasti, Buddha entered into the house of one Tu-T'i, who was
absent from home. Upon the divan a white dog was eating from a
bowl. At sight of Buddha it leapt to the ground and barked at the
Holy One. Buddha said: 'Miser, how deep is thy degradation! ' The
dog betook itself to a corner in dejection. When Tu-T'i returned and
saw his dog so sad he asked the cause of its misery. The servants
replied, ‘Buddha has done this.' Tu-T'i was angered and asked
Buddha for an explanation. Buddha said: ‘I did but tell him the truth.
This animal is thy dead father. Born a dog, as punishment for his
avarice, he still guards his riches. Order him to reveal the treasure
which he has hidden, even from thee, his son.' Tu-T'i returned to his



home and said to the dog, ‘As thou hast been my father in thy
previous incarnation, all of that which was yours is now mine by right.
Show me thy hidden treasure.' The dog crept beneath the divan and
began scratching the earth. There Tu-T'i dug and discovered great
treasure. Forthwith he was converted to Buddha.”
Gray (1878) describes a gruesome ceremony performed after a
suicide:
“Many Chinese believe that suicides are tempted to their fate by a
spirit who presents them with a golden necklace ; and when the
deed has been perpetrated in the house, a religious ceremony is
performed in it by a Taoist priest for the expulsion of this or other
seducing spirits. After the priest has made a great many signs, and
performed the kow-tow, he receives from the inmates a small black
dog, together with a chopper and a block; and when he has severed
its tail from its body with a sharp blow, the wretched animal, with a
cord round its neck, is led or rather dragged, piteously howling, by
the head of the family into every nook and comer of the house. It is
then taken to the front door and kicked into the open street. The
bleeding and yelping cur is supposed to frighten away the evil spirits,
and to pursue them in their flight through the streets. By way of
purifying the house, the priest then walks through it with a brass pan
containing a burning mixture made of sulphur, saltpetre, and other
inflammable ingredients. He is preceded by one bearing a lighted
torch, and at intervals he flings portions of the burning mixture into
the air. The ceremonies of exorcism and purification are now
complete, but lest the spirits should return, the priest before his
departure leaves several mystic scrolls written on sheets of red
paper, to be posted above the doors of the apartments. Should the
deceased have committed suicide by hanging, the beam from which
he suspended himself is removed, lest his spirit should return to rest
upon it.”



Does the Late Record of Dogs Hurt the Argument for China as a
Domestication Locus?
Dogs Pursuing Tiger (Collier)
Proponents for a Middle Eastern locus of domestication have noted
that this “is consistent with the archaeological record that identified
the earliest dog remains in the Middle East (12,000 years ago)....”
(vonHoldt et al., 2010) This suggests that the absence of an equally
early history of domestication in China is a weakness of the East
Asian hypothesis. While this is a factor, it is to be noted that fairly
early Neolithic sites from 3000 to 4000 BC in China show dog bones
as evidence of agricultural development. (Shigehara et al., 1998;
Needham and Bray, 1984). It is easily arguable that relatively
complex dog cultures could have existed even earlier. Neolithic
cultures, such as Native American cultures of the Pacific Northwest,
have been described as having several types of dogs for different



functions.
Phyllis Ackermanʼs observation, discussed in an addendum to a prior
blog, that early representations of hunts in Persian art show
greyhound-like dogs, while more mastiff types appear around 3000
BC, could perhaps be correlated with the arguments that mastiffs
appeared from the areas west of the Chinese provinces, suggesting
that large dogs, perhaps originally guards for flocks, could have
come out of nomadic and semi-nomadic cultures in between China
and the Middle East. (Pope and Ackerman, 1964). Collierʼs argument
for domestication of mastiffs from wolves by Turkish tribes thus
deserves more study, particularly since the area in which they lived
form a migration and trade bridge across Eurasia. See Brown et al.
(2011), noting: "Our findings indicated that Middle Eastern and
Southeast Asian village dog populations must have originated either
from a common gene pool thousands of years before present or
from distinct groups of wolf or wolf-like founders.... The Middle
Eastern and Southeast Asian village dog Y chromosome haplotypes
can be further augmented through expanded sampling in Africa,
Central and northern Eurasia, and the Americas, which will provide a
powerful frame of reference against which ancient samples can be
compared to reconstruct dog migrations through time and, hence, to
better illuminate their origins, whether ultimately multiple or
singular."
Migration has been suggested as a factor relevant to the distribution
of dogs, and a possible alternative to multiple domestications. See
Larson et al. (2012) stating: "Dogs appear in contexts older than
8,000 [years] everywhere else within the maximal distribution of
wolves, suggesting independent domestications of local populations
of wolves, migration of humans possessing dogs, or the secondary
acquisition of dogs by groups that were not involved in the



domestication process." The second and third of these possibilities
might apply to the Chinese canine history, though verifying this
could prove difficult. The fluidity of the tribes that occupied the
steppes, both in antiquity and afterwards, may mean that dogs
would have traveled with the human populations to which they were
attached, leaving smaller remnant populations that would no longer
indicate the true diversity that could have once existed there. The
dogs of both the Middle East and China could represent a sort of
aftershock from an early domestication event (or events) in that
broad region. At least the argument can still be made.
