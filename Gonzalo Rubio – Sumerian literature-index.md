Sumerian Literature

THE SUMERIAN LANGUAGE
Sumerian was a language spoken in the south of Ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). It is most likely first attested in the archaic texts from Uruk and Jemdet Nas+r, from the mid or late fourth millennium to the early third millennium BCE. By the end of the third millennium (the Ur III period), Sumerian had died out for the most part as a spoken language.1 However, it was still used in a wide variety of literary, scholarly, and religious genres, and was preserved in writing until the practical disappearance of the Mesopotamian civilization during the Parthian period (141 BCE–224 CE). Sumerian is an isolate, that is, it is not related to any other language or language family. Thus, our knowledge of Sumerian grammar and lexicon is mostly based on a large number of bilingual texts (in Sumerian and Akkadian), as well as a stream of scribal and scholastic traditions materialized in a corpus of lexical lists and grammatical texts. Mesopotamian cuneiform is the logosyllabic script used to write Sumerian. In a logosyllabic script, signs can be logograms, which stand for whole words, or syllabograms, which write sequences such as CV, VC, V, CVC (C = consonant, V = vowel); e.g., {ba}, {ab}, {a}, {bar}. For instance, as a logogram, the sign AN (originally a star) could write the words an “sky, heaven” and dingir “god,” as well as the VC sequence {an} when used as a syllabogram. Moreover, cuneiform signs are polyphonic, i.e., they have several readings; e.g., the sign NE can be read {ne}, {de3}, {bi2}, etc. On the other hand, the writing interface shows homophony, because different signs can have the same reading, such as {e}, {e2}, {e3}, {e4}. . . {e11} (numerical indexes are used to distinguish between homophonous signs).



The readings of all signs, as well as their polyphony and homophony, are established primarily on the basis of lexical lists, which provide different readings of the same sign by including a syllabic spelling. Furthermore, scribes used determinatives preceding or following some nouns and names, simply as reading aids: KI “place” in lagaški (the city of Lagash), DINGIR “deity” in dnanna (the Moon-god Nanna), etc. As a modern philological convention, when one transliterates a cuneiform sign without specifying which way it should be read in a concrete context, the sign is given all in capitals. Our knowledge of Sumerian phonology is limited by the nature of the writing interface. The vocalic system is quite simple: /a/, /i/, /e/, /u/. Vocalic length seems not to be phonological. The consonantal system includes three series of stops (/b/ and /p/; /d/ and /t/; /g/ and /k/), three sibilants (/s/, /z/, and /š/, the latter corresponding to English sh), two laterals (/1/ and /r/), three nasals (/m/, /n/, and /g/ or /ŋ/), and an uvular or pharyngeal of undefinable nature (/h/ or /h/). Furthermore, the existence of different “extra phonemes”—i.e., segments that would not be immediately obvious in the writing interface—has been proposed. Among these, the velar nasal /g/ or /ŋ/ is now commonly accepted by all Sumerologists; for instance, both {mu} and {gu10} (or {ggu10}) are written with the same sign, MU. The
same can be said of /dr/ (most likely /r4/); e.g., the verb du3 “to build” was
actually /dru/ (or /rr4u/), as substantiated by the Akkadian word narû “stela,” which comes from that Sumerian verbal root, and by the fact that the same sign (du3 = KAK) has also a reading ru2. To further complicate things, some final consonants (Auslaut) seem to drop (kala “mighty” < /kalag/), but the same signs have readings with and without Auslaut: kala = kalag; dug4 = du11 “to speak.” Moreover, our knowledge of Sumerian phonotactics (the parameters determining syllabic structure) is limited as well. Although the cuneiform system, as most syllabaries, precludes the writing of initial and final consonantal clusters, it is quite likely that Sumerian did have them. Furthermore, it has been suggested that Sumerian might have had lexical tones as a suprasegmental feature (as is the case of Chinese), which allegedly would explain the high number of homophonic terms. However, other factors can also explain this, such as different Auslaut consonants and the presence of consonantal clusters. In terms of its morphology, Sumerian is an agglutinative language. Since Wilhelm von Humboldt, linguists have divided languages into at least three main types: (a) agglutinative, which includes a variety of highly agglutinative languages known as polysynthetic (e.g., Amerindian languages); (b) inflected or fusional, which includes all Indo-European and Semitic languages; and (c) isolating or analytical, such as Chinese, in which most morphemes are essentially free words. The distinction between the two kinds of synthetic languages, agglutinative and inflected, is not always sharp. In ag
12 Sumerian Literature



glutinative languages, morphemes are attached to lexemes, either as prefixes or as suffixes. Contrary to what happens in inflected languages, lexemes in agglutinative languages remain unchanged, with no (or very limited) traces of internal inflexion or Ablaut (as opposed to English sing, sang, sung, song). Moreover, each morpheme marks a specific category or function (such as plural or syntactical case), as opposed to the typical convergence and fusion exhibited by morphemes in flexional languages (in Spanish amas “you love,” the morpheme -as is marking both person and tense). The grammatical gender is based on an opposition between animate and inanimate nouns, but has no specific morphological marker and only surfaces in morphosyntactical relations between pronouns and their antecedents. Grammatical number (plural vs. singular) does not need to be marked in writing (lugal “king” or “kings”), but can be made explicit through suffixation (lugal-e-ne /lugal-ene/ “kings”) or reduplication (lugal-lugal “kings”). The absence of marker and the sign reduplication are probably a matter of writing interface, as may be indicated by the construction of plurals with reduplication of the adjective (dingir gal-gal = god-great-great “great gods”) or with both reduplication and a suffix (dingir gal-gal-e-ne = god-great-great-PLURAL “great gods”). In the nominal system there are ten cases, which are marked by attaching suffixes to Noun Phrases (NP’s). Moreover, cases can also be indicated by specific prefixes in verbal forms. NP’s have been traditionally called “nominal chains” by Sumerologists, because all the suffixes are heaped at the very end of the last syntagm:
dumu lugal kalam-ma-ka-ke4-ne-ra /dumu lugal kalam-ak-ak-ene-ra/ son-king-nation-GEN-GEN-PL-DAT “for the sons of the king of the nation (=Sumer)”
An especially striking feature of Sumerian is ergativity. In ergative languages, the subject of an intransitive verb presents the same marker as the object of a transitive verb (the absolutive case), while the subject of a transitive verb presents a marker (the ergative case) that is different from that of the intransitive verb. If English were an ergative language, one would probably say **him sleeps and **me sleep, but I saw him and he saw me. Sumerian has /-e/ as the ergative suffix, and /-ø/ as the marker of absolutive case:
lugal-e e2 mu-un-du3 “the king built the temple” lugal i3-tuš “the king sat down” nin-e in-tud-en “the queen bore me” nin i3-tuš “the queen sat down”
Gonzalo Rubio 13



In fact, Sumerian exhibits split ergativity in its morphology. The ergative alignment is strictly followed only in the nominal system. Independent personal pronouns, imperatives, cohortative verbal forms, and a few non-finite verbal constructions exhibit an accusative alignment—that is, the same syntactic alignment found in English. The system of verbal agreement shows a similar split: The perfective forms are ergative, whereas the imperfective ones show an accusative pattern. Verbal stems are usually divided into two major categories: perfective (Akkadian hamt+u “quick, sudden,” Sumerian lugud “short”) and imperfective (marû “slow, fat,” gid2 “long”). Some verbs most likely marked the marû stem with an affix /-e/. Other verbs (reduplication verbs, like gar “to place”) marked the imperfective with partial reduplication (ga2-ga2), as opposed to complete reduplication in the perfective forms (gar-gar). Alternating verbs (e.g., e3 “to go out”) exhibited an “expanded form” (/e3-d/) for the imperfective. Suppletive or complementary verbs (such as dug4 “to speak”) had completely different lexemes for the imperfective (e from dug4). However, it is possible that many verbs did not have two different stems, and that the only way to distinguish imperfective from perfective in those verbs was through concord (i.e., through pronominal affixes in the verbal form). Verbal forms can present both prefixes and suffixes. The optional slots that are occupied in a verbal form follow this general order: (1) modal prefixes; (2) the connective prefix /inga-/; (3) the so-called conjugation prefixes, which are in actuality topicalizing prefixes or focus markers; (4) dative prefix; (5) dimensional infixes in agreement with implicit or explicit nominal cases in the sentence (such as comitative, terminative, locative); (6) pronominal prefixes; (7) the verbal stem; (8) the suffix /ed/ indicating

directionality of the action (intention, future event, goal); (9) pronominal suffixes; and (10) syntactical suffixes (nominalizer /-a/, enclitic copula). In the case of nominalized verbal forms, these can be followed by possessive suffixes (11) and nominal case markers (12):

SUMERIAN AND SUMERIANS IN MESOPOTAMIAN HISTORY AND CULTURE
The history of Mesopotamia, especially during the third millennium, has been frequently regarded as driven by a pattern of ethnic alternation in political rule. The Early Dynastic period would have been characterized by Sumerian dominance, with the vast majority of documents and texts written in Sumerian. The following period, that of Sargon’s dynasty, would have seen the rising of Akkadian-speaking (Semitic) groups to power, and this would be reflected in the abundance of royal inscriptions and documents in Akkadian. The third millennium would have ended with the return of the Sumerians to power during the Ur III dynasty. This sort of ethnically based history stems from several historical and cultural fallacies, all of which gravitate around a supposedly dramatic ethnic divide between speakers of Sumerian and speakers of Akkadian. Sumerian is first and foremost a linguistic entity, the name of a language that died out as anyone’s mother tongue rather early in Mesopotamian history, during the Ur III period, toward the end of the third millennium. Any inference made regarding historical periods allegedly dominated by “Sumerian ethnicity” (that of the speakers of Sumerian) and “Sumerian culture” stem from a rigid, and often oversimplifying, approach to the relation between language and ethnicity. This complicated relation can be exemplified by three major issues in the study of Mesopotamia: the so-called Sumerian problem; the apparent cultural contrast between the north and the south of Babylonia; and the alleged ethnic alternation in the history sequence from the Early Dynastic to Ur III period. The “Sumerian problem” is predicated on a seemingly simple question: When did the Sumerians arrive in Mesopotamia? Needless to say, one could answer with another question: Is there any strong reason to believe that the speakers of Sumerian were not autochthonous to Mesopotamia? In this respect, some scholars believe that Sumerian and its speakers would have

not entered southern Mesopotamia until shortly before the Early Dynastic I period (around 2900 BCE). In fact, it has been argued that the first textual evidence of the Sumerian language appears in the archaic texts from Ur (2700–2600), and that such evidence is absent in the earlier, archaic texts from Uruk—that is, phases Uruk IV (3500–3200) and, more importantly, Uruk III (3200–2900). Therefore, some believe that the language of the archaic texts from the Late Uruk period was probably not Sumerian (Englund 1998: 81). However, there are some instances of phonetic writing in Late Uruk texts, which point to Sumerian as the language of these texts: phonetic indicators (e.g., ŠE in ŠEG9+ŠE+BAR = ŠEGBAR = šeg9-bar “fallow deer”); and some phonetic spellings, such as the use of the signs SI4 and ZI as if they were homophonous. Only in Sumerian would those logograms correspond to words with that specific phonetic shape, which would allow the use of these signs exclusively according to their phonetic reading (Rubio 2005: 321–23).2 One can also point out that to ask where the Sumerians came from is misleading. If one were to ask where Americans (that is, U.S. citizens) came from, the answer would be simple: from nowhere. They became Americans because they came to America. In the case of Sumerian, the problem is compounded by the fact that Sumerian is not a very straightforward ethnonym. In this respect, one should note the presence of Semitic names among the scribes mentioned in colophons of Sumerian texts from the Early Dynastic III period. Nonetheless, neither did the bearing of a Semitic name necessarily mean that the bearer spoke Semitic, nor did the presence of a Sumerian name point to anything other than social and religious context. Because of the difficulties encountered when devising an ethno-linguistic scenario for early Mesopotamia, the traditional Sumerian/Akkadian dichotomy has sometimes been substituted with another supposedly more subtle: north (i.e., Semitic) versus south (i.e., Sumerian). The apparent cultural contrast between the north and the south of Babylonia depends on the issue of land tenure during the third millennium. It has been argued that, in southern Mesopotamia, the vast majority of the economic resources available in a specific city-state, especially its arable land, were regarded as the rightful property of the local pantheon of deities (Steinkeller 1999: 290). Thus, the gods had nominal ownership of the land and the temples managed it; basic subsistence fields would have been allocated to the inhabitants of a city-state in relation to their status. On the other hand, in the north of Babylonia, the palace and the elites—but not the temple, at least not in a significant manner—controlled the majority of the arable land (Steinkeller 1999: 299). Moreover, the most important contrast lies in the alienation of land, which would have been allowed in the north but not really in the south. These economic differences would have been the result of economic, ecological, socio-political, cultural, and reli
16 Sumerian Literature



gious variables (Steinkeller 1999: 301–8). In the (mostly Sumerian) south, city-states seem to have been organized around temples, without a fully developed social stratification, and with a negligible element of privately owned land. In the (Akkadian, i.e., Semitic) north, there were actual territorial states (such as Kish), allegedly characterized by an oligarchy of elders, which displayed a well stratified social system and whose temples played a marginal role in economic matters. Thus, the Sumerian south appears to have been characterized by the theological discourse of city-gods and the Semitic north marked by its nomadic past and its astral deities (such as Inanna/Ishtar). After the Early Dynastic period, the Sargonic rulers stripped many of these traditional institutions of their lands and placed these estates under direct state control. However, in the Ur III period, this land was returned to the temples. This shift in economic systems would appear to be driven by the ethnicity of the ruling class, as seemingly exemplified by the predominant language of the documents in each period and the names of its rulers: Sumerian in the Early Dynastic and Ur III periods, and Akkadian during the Sargonic period, sandwiched between both “Sumerian periods.” However, there are problems with this contrast between north and south in economic, political, and social terms. For instance, there were city-states also in the north (Akshak, Mari), and the archaic texts (Uruk III period) from the north (Jemdet Nas+r, Tell – Uqair) and the south (Uruk) are almost identical. In regard to Kish, this city was most certainly very prominent during the Early Dynastic, both as a center of learning (for example, scribes from Kish show up in Early Dynastic texts from Ebla, in northern Syria) and as a political entity (the title “king of Kish” had become iconic by the time of Mesalim). However, very few Early Dynastic texts have been found at Kish, so it is difficult to paint any coherent picture of this city during this period. In fact, to date there are substantially more texts from the Early Dynastic period in the southernmost part of Mesopotamia (Sumer) than in the center or the north. Moreover, the evidence springs from very different contexts: Southern texts come from temple archives, while the north has yielded mainly royal and private archives. Thus, one can wonder to which extent the north/south contrast in terms of land tenure—and its ethnic corollaries concerning Sumerian versus Akkadian/Semitic—is shaped by the serendipitous nature of the available evidence. In many respects, the main scholarly construct concerning ethnically based history hinges on the Ur III period. The Ur III period was traditionally regarded as being characterized by a resurgence or a “renaissance” of the Sumerians, who would have been somehow subjugated during the Sargonic period (the Akkadian period). However, a close examination of the royal iconography and the royal titulary shows that the theo-political discourse of the kings of the Ur III dynasty had as much in common with their Sargonic

predecessors as with their alleged Sumerian forefathers in the Early Dynastic period (Becker 1985). In fact, only the names of the first two kings of the Ur III dynasty are properly Sumerian (Ur-Namma and Shulgi); the rest are Semitic (Amar-Sin, Shu-Sin, and Ibbi-Sin). Moreover, even the fuzzy criterion that purports to triangulate the variables of ethnicity, language, and personal names starts to crumble when one considers that Shulgi’s mother tongue was most likely Akkadian (Rubio 2006a). In spite of the presence of two different and well-attested languages, Sumerian and Akkadian, Mesopotamian history and culture need to be understood as one single but rich tapestry, whose many threads extended throughout a period of over three thousand years (Rubio 2005, 2007b). Intellectual constructs such as “Sumerian history” and “Sumerian culture” cannot be carved out of the complex reality of Mesopotamian history and culture. Sumerian was a language in which an always intriguing and often unique corpus of literary compositions was produced, alongside vast numbers of economic and administrative documents, royal inscriptions, magical texts, and various scholarly works. Beginning with the period in which texts start to contain explicit and retrievable information about personal names and places—the mid third millennium—it is complicated to define unequivocally any possible ethnic and historical reality behind the use of the Sumerian language and occurrence of Sumerian names. Moreover, although languages do have, at least for some period of time, native speakers, the ethnic and historical identity of these speakers is not necessarily shaped by their language. As happens nowadays, ethnic identities can be socially construed and are historically in flux, regardless of language markers.
UNDERSTANDING SUMERIAN LITERATURE
The Literary Fabric and Poetics
Some of the main categorical distinctions and taxonomies employed in literary studies are of limited application in the case of the Sumerian literary tradition. A divide as simple as that between prose and verse poses the first problem. Attempts have been made to find formal criteria (rhyme, metrical patterns, and the like) that would characterize a given Sumerian text as poetic (Vanstiphout 1993: 305). However, due to our limited knowledge of Sumerian phonology, these inquiries into the segmental and suprasegmental aspects of poetic language—the nature of its prosody—have yielded limited results. Most verses seem to have anywhere between four and twelve syllables, although the syllabic counting is rather tentative in the light of our knowl

edge of Sumerian phonotactics; e.g., many CVCV sequences (seemingly bisyllabic) may mask the presence of clusters CCV constituting single syllables. Lines whose number of syllables exceeds these general parameters tend to contain personal names and may have served as modulatory transitions for changes in mode or key during singing or chanting (Kilmer 1993–1997: 480). Moreover, it has been proposed that in their performance (singing, chanting, public reading) Sumerian verses had four beats per line, even if some of the beats remained unvocalized and were represented only with a musical beat, and that they ended in trochaic sequences, i.e., an unstressed or unaccented syllable preceded by a stressed or accented one (Kilmer 1993–1997: 480). However, our understanding of Sumerian suprasegmentals is so limited that one cannot conclude what kind of stress accent Sumerian may have had: pitch accent; dynamic accent (based on the level of loudness); qualitative accent (predicated on sequences of full versus reduced vowels); and quantitative accent (grounded in vocalic length and similar to the agogic accent in music). All in all, there is a simple formal criterion that seems to define Sumerian literature as essentially poetic, inasmuch as it is constituted by patterned strings of words or verses: Lines tend to constitute syntactically or semantically self-contained units. Most lines correspond to full sentences. This is a characteristic shared by literary, liturgical, and scholarly compositions, but it is rare in the most abundant of all nonliterary genres of Sumerian textuality: administrative documents (Veldhuis 2004: 49–50). Moreover, scribes tended to preserve the same line divisions through different copies of the same composition in diverse periods.3 Even when two lines are merged or a line is split in a specific manuscript of a composition, in most instances the merger or the split point to two shorter verse units, since enjambment of individual words or short word sequences is rather rare. This indicates an awareness of lines as minimal compositional units exhibiting formal integrity. However, equating a line of text with an actual verse poses some problems, as long lines may be easily divided into smaller units (Wilcke 1975: 220–24; Vanstiphout 1993: 305–6). Vanstiphout (1993; 1998: 38–42) has argued that verses can be divided into long (or full) and short (or half):
gišgid2-da a2 me3-ke4 | si bi2-ib-sa2-sa2-e-ne
The spears, the arms of battle, | were being launched. (Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur 383; Michałowski 1989: 60–61)
pa-bi an-ne2 us2-sa-am3 Its crown reaches heaven.
(Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta 521; Vanstiphout 2003a: 86–87)
20 Sumerian Literature



A third verse type would be characterized by short lines that, although appearing in a linear sequence, would exhibit a semantic and grammatical hierarchical relation to one another, and thus represent a mixture of long and short verses (Vanstiphout 1993: 319–21). Nevertheless, according to Vanstiphout, the main diagnostic of poetic form in Sumerian would lie in the presence of strophic structures or stanzas (chiefly distichs, tercets, quatrains, and sextets). These stanzas seem mostly semantically defined. An example of distich can be found in the following lines from the disputation between Summer and Winter (314–15):
nam-šeš nam-du10-sa i3 li-gin7 i-im-bal-bal-e-ne murub4-ba inim dug3-ga ga2-ga2-de3 teš2-bi ba-dug3-ge-eš They pour out brotherhood and friendship like fine oil. By bringing sweet words to their midst, they have happily reconciled (cp. Vanstiphout 2003b: 179; COS 1: 588).
An example of sextet can be identified in this passage from the Ur Lament (219–24):

These men who had been slain with axes, did not have their heads covered with a cloth. Like a gazelle caught in a trap, their mouths were touching the dust. The men who had been struck down with spears, were not bound with bandages. As if in the place of women, their mothers, in labor, they lay in their own blood. Those men who had been slain with battle-maces, were not bandaged with new cloth (var. did not have their hands bound). Although they were not drunk with beer, their necks were resting on their shoulders (cp. Römer 2004: 52–53, 96–97).
This alleged sextet could also be analyzed as a series of three distichs. Since these strophic groupings are essentially based on semantic variables, and, since a common trope of Sumerian literature is the binary sequence (i.e., the parallelistic contrast between two elements), distichs are particularly easy to identify as cogent units. One could ask why, in the absence of any reconstructable prosody, these passages are necessarily poetry as opposed to prose. Ultimately, the answer lies in the literary tropes and connotative devices that populate those Sumerian texts we label primarily as literary and only subsequently as poetic. Literariness can be defined by the predominance of connotation over deno

tation, by the abundance of tropes, and by intertextual kinships. Moreover, the specifically poetic nature of Sumerian literary texts can be established on the basis of the frequency of specific tropes (parallelisms, repetitions), a common repertoire of imagery (similes, metaphors, metonymies), and a shared body of lexical items (Cooper 1978: 14- 23; Black 1998: 50–57; Veldhuis 2004: 51–55). The presence of a literary lexicon and the accumulation of tropes establish a tapestry of intertextual connections and genealogies. These intertextual bridges configure a referential system within which works are written and read. In the case of Sumerian literature, such interconnections stretch beyond literature itself, as in the case of literary texts that are shaped on the template of lexical lists (Civil 1987a; Rubio 2003). Ultimately, one should not ignore the fact that prose tends to be a later development and that poetry normally predates prose in most literary traditions. In fact, as Godzich and Kittay (1987: 191) noted, prose literacy is not simply a matter of style but rather a radically different signifying practice. There is always the chance that prosody itself played a limited role (if any at all) in Sumerian. In the Ancient Near East, quantitative (vocalic or syllabic length) or accentual parameters seem generally of secondary importance in defining poetic texts. For instance, Biblical Hebrew—a language whose prosodic structure is better understood than that of Sumerian—seems to mark its poetic language through tropes and verse classes grounded in syntactic structures (O’Connor 1997). Likewise, Hittite poetics appears to be characterized by non-prosodic devices, by tropes such as alliteration, anaphora, and even rhyme, all of which contribute to shape a rhythm predicated on several linguistic levels, from phonetic echoing to syntactic dislocation (Haas 2006: 157–58). In this respect, Sumerian poetry was endowed with all sorts of rhythms stemming from a variety of tropes, including sometimes merely phonetic devices like alliteration and rhyme (Cooper 1978: 16263). Sumerian poetry probably acquired a dominant prosodic makeup in the case of songs, whose accompanying music would generate the alternations of quantities (marked by duration), as well as stressed and unstressed syllables (marked by rests and meter, including syncopation).
Genres, Performative Rubrics, and Titles
The generic names usually assigned to Sumerian compositions (such as epic, myth, and lamentation) are the result of our modern taxonomic approach to this literary corpus, which is ultimately grounded in the classical (Greco-Roman) classification and theory of genres. Mesopotamian scribes had their own indigenous labels for compositions that were intended to be performed in one way or another, i.e., for hymns, laments, and songs (Wilcke 1975: 252–92; Kilmer 1993–1997). These labels normally concern hymnic compositions as a whole (subscripts), as well as various musical an
22 Sumerian Literature



notations regarding sections of these compositions (rubrics). For the most part, rubrics correspond to labels inserted within a composition, which can indicate musical passages or the modal type of each section in a long hymnodic composition (Kilmer 1993–1997: 471); e.g., after a series of lines in the Nippur lament, one finds the line ki-ru-gu2 X-kam-ma-am3 “it is kirugu number X” (the Nippur lament consists of twelve kirugus). Moreover, subscripts (Unterschriften) occur at the end of the composition, preceding the scribal colophon, and denote kinds of hymnic works according to a rather miscellaneous array of criteria (see also section on “Prayers, laments, and songs” below)4:
• Musical instruments involved in the performance of the composition; for instance: balag songs (a balag was probably both a harp and a kind of drum); tigi songs (a tigi was a musical instrument); adab songs (an a-da-ab was a kind of drum); and eršemma laments (er2-šem3-ma “wail or dirge of the šem-drum”) • šir-compositions (šir3 “song”), e.g., širgida (šir3-gid2-da “long song”), širnamšub (šir3-nam-šub lit. “incantation-song”), and širnamgala (šir3nam-gala “song of the gala-priesthood”) • Other compositions whose name probably refers to aspects of their musical performance but whose exact meanings remain uncertain, such as balbale (bal-bal-e) and ululumama (u3-lu-lu-ma-ma)
• Compositions whose name does not have specific musical connotations, such as the eršahunga laments or prayers (er2-ša3-hun-ga2 “wail or dirge to soothe the heart [of an irate god]”) and the šuila prayers (šu-il2-la “the raising of the hand [in a praying posture]”)
Hymnic compositions with names referring to musical instruments, types of songs, and the like, include a variety of rubrics inserted between their different sections and pertaining to their musical performance: kirugu, gišgigal, kišu, sagarra, sagidda, šabatuku, barsu (or barsud), and uru or urubim. The terms kirugu and gišgigal are closely connected.5 A kirugu (ki-ru-gu2,
meaning perhaps “place to retune”), translated into Akkadian as še,ru šanû (literally “second song”), refers to a unit of text defined as such not by a fixed number of lines but rather by some sort of performative element. A gišgigal (giš-gi4-gal2), translated into Akkadian as mihru (“opposite, antiphon”), is a section of one or two lines, which constitutes a refrain or ritornello in antiphonic response to a kirugu. The kirugu and the gišgigal may perhaps correspond to a “call-and-response” antiphonic style of singing, as in the Indian responsorial sawa,l -jawaa,b—the kirugu might have been the call or “question” (sawa,l) and the gišgigal the response (jawaa,b). The division between kirugu and gišgigal is attested in the five city laments (over Ur, Uruk, Nippur, Eridu, and Sumer and Ur), as well as in an Old Babylonian
Gonzalo Rubio 23



balag song, a hymn to Inanna on behalf of Ur-Ninurta, king of Isin (Sjöberg 1977), and a lament of Damu (Fritz 2003: 183–86). The term kišu (ki-šu2) probably refers to the cadence at the end of a
composition and is translated into Akkadian as kīlu, which means both “enclosure, confinement” and “closing.” Sumerian šu2 means “to sink down, to fall”—as well as “to cover, to envelop”—so ki-šu2 can be understood as “place of the fall, place of modulation, cadence.”6 The rubrics sagarra (sa-gar-ra) and sagidda (sa-gid2-da) allude to the musical mode, as they contain the word sa meaning “musical string” (Akkadian pitnu).7 Sagarra probably indicates set mode (“loosened string”) and sagidda plucked mode (“tightened string”).
The rubrics šabatuku (ša3-ba-tuku) and barsu or barsud (bar-sud = barsu3) seem to indicate the opposite of each other, since ša3 means “inside” and bar “outside,” but their specific meanings remain unclear (Krecher 1966: 32; Wilcke 1975: 260). Likewise, the term uru (u18-ru12 = ULU3-EN) or urubim (u18-ru12-bi-im) is difficult to interpret (Wilcke 1975: 260). Since the only original terminology associated with some Sumerian compositions seems to point to performative elements or functions, it is usual to resort to labels such as lament, hymn, epic, or myth. As descriptive and practical as such labels may be, one should not lose sight of their potential pitfalls.8 For instance, what we call “Sumerian epics” are simple stories about legendary characters, kings who may or may not have existed in actuality, like Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh. These stories are focused on deeds and exploits in which the hero’s wits and even trickery are much more relevant than his bravery and skills as a warrior. This emphasis on the less violent and more practical side of heroism closely resembles the typical features of folktales and can hardly fit into our Western understanding of epic, especially as shaped by the Homeric poems.9 The disparity between modern and ancient (native) modes of classification also manifests itself in the titles by which Sumerian compositions are now commonly known. Mesopotamian scribes named compositions by the first words of the first line (the incipit), as is evident in the way they appear listed in the catalogues attested already in the Urr III and Old Babylonian period. For instance, in these catalogues Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta is referred to as uru gu4 huš (“O city, fierce bull . . .”), as those are the first words of its first line (cp. Vanstiphout 2003a: 56–57). In a couple of instances, modern scholars have adopted the ancient name; e.g., Lugale (or Lugal-e) and Angim (or An-gim). Lugale, also known as Ninurta’s Exploits or The Epic of Ninurta, is actually titled after the first word of the composition (lugal-e “king,” in the ergative case) in two first-millennium copies, although earlier (Old Babylonian) copies begin simply with lugal, without the case ending /-e/. Moreover, Angim, also known as Ninurta’s Return to Nippur, takes its modern title from the first two words of the composition an-gim or an-gin7
24 Sumerian Literature



(gim and gin7 are two readings of the same sign), meaning “like (the god) An.” Furthermore, it should be noted that the aforementioned terminology (seemingly generic and mostly performance-related) is frequently at odds with our Western theory of genres. The composition known as Angim was labeled with the subscript sirgidda (šir3-gid2-da “long song”) by Old Babylonian scribes (Cooper 1978: 3–4). Likewise, a broken subscript in a tablet fragment from Old Babylonian Nippur of Lugale reads [šir3]-"sud?# dnin-urta-ka “širsud of Ninurta” (a širsud being a kind of song, see below), although the same subscript could be read [za3]-"mi2
?# dnin-urta-ka “zami of Ninurta” (cf. text Z2 in van Dijk 1983: II 181). Nevertheless, neither the length of these two compositions—especially Lugale, with 728 lines—nor their contents seem to fit our modern understanding of the generic labels song or hymn. Thus, most Assyriologists prefer to refer to these compositions on Ninurta alternatively as epics, myths, or simply narratives. Other native labels do not pertain to genres or performance at all, but describe the very shape of the tablet on which a text (a specific textual witness of a composition) is written. For instance, a typical Old Babylonian school exercise was inscribed on a tablet that contained only one column per side and about fifteen to forty lines per column. This kind of tablet was labeled as imgidda (im-gid2-da “long tablet”) in scribes’ colophons (Hunger 1968: 7).
The Nature of the Sumerian Literary Corpus
In spite of the performative rubrics discussed above, the bulk of Sumerian literary compositions were most likely mere scribal artifacts. Most narrative, mythological, sapiential, and even a number of hymnic works were not performed. There were quite possibly folkloric traditions about Gilgamesh and about Enmerkar, for instance, but they belonged to an oral lore that can be neither recovered nor clearly linked to the written compositions recorded on clay tablets. In fact, the lives of many Sumerian literary compositions were probably limited to the scribal circles, especially within the confines of a social and cultural institution known as the edubba (e2-dub-ba or e2-dubba-a “school,” literally “tablet house”).10 The divorce between production and consumption (i.e., writing and performance) of artistic works is not a particularly unusual phenomenon. For instance, J. S. Bach composed his Mass in B minor according to the Roman Catholic ordinary cycle in Latin, as an expansion of a Lutheran missa brevis. However, there was no occasion for the performance of such a Mass in Lutheran Leipzig, and there is no indication that this Latin mass was commissioned by any patron, such as the Catholic court at Dresden (Wolff 2000: 441–42). By producing such an apparently decontextualized Mass, Bach was establishing a musical dialogue and placing himself within a learned tradition that was initiated
Gonzalo Rubio 25



by Catholic composers, such as Palestrina. Moreover, a number of Bach’s major compositions, such as his St. Matthew Passion, required performing forces that greatly exceeded those of a normal cantata and did not fit very well in the austerity of the Lutheran liturgical and religious milieu (Wolff 2000: 345). Many Sumerian literary compositions are thoroughly scholastic and appear detached from performative goals of any kind. They are in fact scribal artifacts from conception to transmission. This understanding of the scribal setting of Sumerian literature is embodied in the modern curricular approach to its corpus (Tinney 1999a; Veldhuis 2004: 58–66). However, the curricular approach does not imply that all Sumerian literary texts are scribal exercises or merely the result of scribal activities. A number of compositions are preserved in single copies and some groups of tablets seem to constitute homogeneous cultic archives, sharing similar format and paleographic features (Veldhuis 2003: 42). Moreover, many hymnic compositions were most likely performed. Many royal hymns devoted to the kings of the Ur III and Isin dynasties were probably performed at those courts—but it is also quite likely that many other royal hymns were produced at the school, by the school, and for the school. In a few instances, both the performance and extracurricular nature of some compositions were inherent to their genres, as is the case of many cultic compositions, especially canonical lamentations, dirges, and songs (e.g., balags and eršemmas). Defining the boundaries of the Sumerian literary corpus is not always easy. Although the formal aspects of literariness mentioned above pose no serious problem, their typological implementation involves a certain level of subjectivity on the part of the modern scholar. For instance, Sumerian incantations exhibit many typically literary features (Michałowski 1981; Veldhuis 1999). Size is not an issue, as incantations may belong to series or collections, such as the exorcist’s incantations in the series udug-hul “the evil udug-demons,” Akkadian utukku lemnutu (Geller 1985; COS 1: 539–40). However, because of their strong performative element, supposedly practical purpose, and complex magical context, most approaches to Sumerian literature leave them out, and the present contribution will do the same. On the other hand, liturgical texts (especially canonical lamentations) may be somehow less literary than incantations insofar as the former tend to be repetitious collections of commonplaces devised for communal cultic practices. Nevertheless, because the canonical lamentations were regarded by Mesopotamian scribes as part of a broad genre of songs and laments and were labeled as such (with rubrics and subscripts), it seems justified to include them as part of the literary corpus. A glimpse at what Sumerian scribes understood as a literary canon can be grasped from the literary catalogues preserved. These catalogues simply list the incipits of compositions. There are a couple of catalogues from the Ur III
26 Sumerian Literature



period (Hallo 1963; Civil 1975: 145 n. 36). There are about a dozen from the Old Babylonian period, but three are particularly important: the Philadelphia catalogue from Nippur; the Louvre catalogue; and the Ur catalogue at the Iraq Museum in Baghdad (Vanstiphout 2003c). A great deal can be inferred about the native understanding of genres from which compositions and genres are included in these catalogues, and which ones are not. For instance, although there are some Old Babylonian catalogues of balags specifically (Cohen 1988: 17), no balag seems to be listed in any of the major literary catalogues. However, city laments, which belonged to a genre seemingly germane to that of balags, do figure prominently in the general catalogues. The catalogues focus on five essential groups of compositions: (a) narratives, such as the cycles of Aratta and the stories about Gilgamesh; (b) compositions of ideological or theo-political importance, especially the collection of Temple Hymns and the Sumerian King List; (c) royal and divine hymns; (d) city laments, including the Curse of Akkade; and (e) compositions closely related to the scribal milieu, such as debates, dialogues, and compositions set at the edubba itself. Still, this is a matter in which ancient and modern understandings of genre do not fully overlap. One would expect Angim and Lugale to be listed among the narratives of these catalogues. Both deal with Ninurta’s exploits, were eventually transmitted with an interlinear Akkadian translation, and are among the most widely attested Mesopotamian literary texts. However, neither of them is listed in the important Philadelphia catalogue from Nippur, although they do occur in the Louvre and Ur catalogues. A possible explanation for that may stem from their rather surprising subscripts mentioned above: Angim received the subscript širgidda (šir3-gid2da “long song”) in three different manuscripts from Nippur, whereas an Old Babylonian Nippur fragment of Lugale seems to have been given the subscript [šir3]-"sud?# dnin-urta-ka “širsud of Ninurta” (a širsud was a kind of song). Having labeled both compositions as kinds of songs, perhaps the Nippur scribes did not regard them as narratives belonging to the same group as the Enmerkar, Lugalbanda, and Gilgamesh stories. A particularly challenging aspect of Sumerian literature pertains to authorship. In the case of Akkadian literature, a few names appear associated with the creation, textualization, or a specific redaction of a number of compositions (Foster 1991). For the Sumerian corpus, the tradition gives us the names of two alleged authors: Enheduanna and Lu-Inanna (Michałowski 1996: 183–86). Enheduanna was the daughter of Sargon, the king of Akkad, as well as a priestess of the Moon-god Nanna at Ur. Up to six compositions are attributed to her: a long hymn to Inanna known as The Exaltation of Inanna or Ninmešarra (nin me šar2-ra “lady of all the me’s/divine powers”; Zgoll 1997); Inanna hymn C or Inninšagurra (in-nin ša3-gur4-ra “lady with a great heart”; Sjöberg 1975a); the narrative known as Inanna and Ebih (Attinger 1998); the collection of Temple Hymns (Sjö
Gonzalo Rubio 27



berg and Bergmann 1969); a balbale song of Nanna; and an Ur III tablet mentioning Nanna-Suen and Enheduanna (Goodnick Westenholz 1989). However, the main composition attributed to her that includes some possibly autobiographical data (Ninmešarra) was most likely composed several centuries after Enheduanna’s death, in the Old Babylonian period (Civil 1980: 229). Aside from the aforementioned Ur III text, no composition traditionally attributed to her appears in a single tablet that could be dated prior to 1800 (Veldhuis 2003: 31 n. 2). In fact, there can be little doubt that Enheduanna started to be regarded as an author only in a tradition that begins centuries after her death: This is a case of traditional authorship, not historical. The other supposed author is Lu-Inanna, “chief leatherworker (ašgab gal) of Enlil,” who according to the composition itself would have dictated the Tummal Chronicle to a scribe (Sollberger 1962; Oelsner 2003). However, this composition is not the historical document that it purports to be but rather a scribal artifact. Thus, the attribution of its authorship to a leatherworker is an ironic device within an erudite exercise in fake royal legitimation (Michałowski 2006c). In terms of size, the corpus of Sumerian literary compositions listed in the Philadelphia literary catalogue from Old Babylonian Nippur amounts to about 14,000 lines (Civil 1975: 145 n. 26). This is not a particularly striking figure, as it is right between the number of hexameters of the Odyssey (12,110) and that of the Iliad (15,693). Nonetheless, one must add compositions not listed in that catalogue, such as Lugale (728 lines), Angim (209 lines), many royal hymns, the Gudea cylinders, and a few others. Leaving aside incantations, incantation series, and liturgical texts (balags and eršemmas), the Sumerian literary corpus may reach some 23,000 lines.
The Physical Medium: Tablet Typology
The physical medium of Sumerian literature is the cuneiform script written on clay tablets, prisms, cylinders, statues, and other surfaces. The study of the types of inscribed materials sheds light on the relation between compositions and between compositions and the scribal setting. Civil established a modern typology of lexical texts and school exercises (1995: 2308; also Veldhuis 1997: 28–41). This typology provided a general framework for the physical endeavor of copying and grouping texts of various genres. Within this framework a general typology, including lexical and exercise tablets (types I to IV) alongside literary texts (types S, M, and P), has been devised (Tinney 1999a: 160):
• Tablet type I: large tablets containing five or six columns per side and hundreds of lines. This type corresponds to lexical texts and is attested in all periods.
28 Sumerian Literature



• Tablet type II: medium-sized tablets containing teacher-pupil exercises, including different ones on obverse and reverse (lexical lists, model contracts, proverbs). On the left side of the obverse (flat side), the teacher wrote an extract of a text in careful script, amounting to anywhere between eight and thirty lines. To the right of the first column, there was space for one to three additional columns, in which the pupil would copy the teacher’s model. The pupil’s copy was normally erased and the tablet reused. Thus, most preserved type-II tablets contain only the left column, with the teacher’s model. On the reverse (convex side), four or five columns contained the same distribution of text, although the model used is normally taken from an earlier curricular stage than that of the obverse text (Veldhuis 1997: 36). Type II is found only in the Old Babylonian period. • Tablet type III: single-column tablets, containing a text extract and the copy exercise (as in type II), running from obverse to reverse. This type is attested in all periods. For single-column tablets inscribed with literary texts, see Type S below. • Tablet type IV: lentils or lenticular tablets (Sumerian im-šu “handsized tablet”). On the obverse (flat side), the pupil’s copy follows a teacher’s model consisting of two to four lines taken from a lexical list, a mathematical text, a proverb, or a hymn extract. In some instances, the reverse (convex side) gives the syllabic spelling of the signs written on the obverse and/or their Akkadian translation. They come mostly from the Old Babylonian and sometimes from the Middle Babylonian periods. • Type S (single-column tablets): this is the imgidda (im-gid2-da “long tablet”), and some S-type tablets are labeled such in their colophons (Hunger 1968: 7). With one column per side, they normally include only extracts (normally about thirty to sixty lines, but sometimes up to one hundred lines) from longer compositions. Some short compositions do fit on a single imgidda, and a few imgiddas include more than one composition (Edzard 2004: 569). • Type M (multicolumn tablets): they contain from two to five columns per side, although some copies of monumental texts may have more columns. They may be inscribed with extracts, entire compositions, or even several compositions—the latter are called Sammeltafeln. • Type P (Prisms): prisms have from four to nine faces, with one column per face (though some may have two). In Old Babylonian Nippur, prisms seem to have been used for a small group of compositions (the Curse of Akkade, royal hymns, literary letters, and dialogues), but not for longer narratives such as the Enmerkar stories (Veldhuis 1997: 31 n. 88). Cylinders have a single face divided into multiple columns and for typological purposes they can be grouped along with prisms.
Gonzalo Rubio 29



In spite of their impressive appearance, prisms and large tablets containing whole literary compositions may sometimes represent derivative copies of inferior quality, as in the case of a six-column tablet with the Curse of Akkade (Cooper 1983: 46) and a prism of Shulgi hymn A (Klein 1981a: 170–71 n. 266).
Editing Sumerian Literature
As the reader may have already perceived, a number of Sumerian literary compositions are preserved in multiple copies, sometimes dating to different periods. Some tablets contain extracts, others whole compositions, and a few are Sammeltafeln including more than one composition. Quite frequently, these tablets are partly damaged or have survived only in isolated fragments of various sizes. Nevertheless, Sumerologists are not faced with staggering numbers of manuscripts of the same composition, as does happen with Greek and Roman literature. Moreover, whereas Greek and Roman literature is attested, for the most part, in manuscripts dating to the Middle Ages (except papyri from Hellenistic and Roman Egypt), the manuscripts of Sumerian compositions were copied within the Mesopotamian stream of tradition. Likewise, Greek and Latin manuscripts can be grouped in families, in which many manuscripts are shown to derive from specific exemplars and archetypes. However, establishing the family tree of manuscipts (stemma codicum) turns out to be mostly impossible in the case of Sumerian literature. Thus, whereas Classicists include a selective body of manuscript variants, excluding derivative copies, as footnotes (apparatus criticus) in their critical editions, Sumerologists normally opt for complete scores (Partituren; Edzard 2004: 567–68). In a typical Sumerological score, all the different attestations of the same line of a given composition are given in parallel. For instance, line 30 of the Temple Hymns is preserved in one Ur III manuscript (A1) and in two Old Babylonian ones (A and B):
A1 6N-T781 rev. i 5 zag-"du8# sal4(SILA3)-pa4-ar-zu kur-un A CBS 7073 obv. i 30 zag-du8 [a]-"sal#-bar-zu kur-un3(BAD3) B CBS 19767 obv. i 30 [zag-d]u8 [a]-sal-bar-zu kur-un3
Your threshold and architrave (are) a high mountain (Sjöberg and Bergmann 1969: 18; Rubio 2000: 207).
The square brackets indicate that a sign cannot be read because that part of the tablet is damaged, but it can be assumed on the basis of other copies, parallels, phraseology, or the like. The half square brackets are used for signs that are partly damaged but that can still be read or quite reasonably presumed. If needed, the side of the tablet can be indicated with abbreviations (obv., rev.), and the columns with Roman numerals (usually in lower case). A variation of the score system is the matrix, in which the whole lines are
30 Sumerian Literature



not repeated in parallel, but special marks are used to indicate which signs are present (+), omitted (–), slightly damaged (.), broken (o), or impossible to identify (x) in every duplicate (Civil 1994: 207). The tablet abbreviations can pertain to excavation numbers or to museum numbers. For instance, in the above example, CBS stands for Catalogue of the Babylonian Section (of the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania) and 6N-T781 refers to the field number of tablets and prisms excavated at Nippur (6N-T781 = tablet number 781 of the sixth season of excavations at Nippur). Tablets with a 6N-T excavation number are housed at different institutions: the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, and the Babylonian Collection at Yale University. 6N-T781 happens to be at the Iraq Museum, where it received the museum number IM 70110.
Emesal as a Literary Dialect
Sumerian is called eme-gir15 (perhaps “native tongue”) in Sumerian sources (šumeru in Akkadian). In some Mesopotamian scholarly texts, a few lexical items and grammatical forms are identified as eme-sal (perhaps “fine language”). The fact is that emesal is attested in compositions of very specific genres: cultic songs performed by the gala-priests (gala, Akkadian kalû); diverse texts containing the goddess Inanna’s speech (myths, the InannaDumuzi cycle, etc.); some laments over the destruction of cities, usually uttered by goddesses (those of Ur, Eridu, and Nippur); a lullaby supposedly addressed to a son of Shulgi by his mother (Kramer 1971); about thirty proverbs or short sayings from the rhetorical collections of Sumerian proverbs; a couple of women’s work songs, including The Song of the Millstone (Civil 2006); the “Dialogues between two women”; and a few lexical lists. Very few compositions can be regarded, in one way or another, as entirely written in emesal. For instance, Dialogue 5 (Two Women B) exhibits emesal features in almost all its lines, with the exception of a couple uttered by a (male) judge. In general, however, there is no true consistency in the use of emesal, so an otherwise “main-dialect” text may present some scattered emesal words.11 It has been argued that emesal was a women’s language (Frauensprache) or genderlect. Words in emesal are frequently uttered by goddesses and by gala-priests. Moreover, the sign SAL can also be read munus “woman.” Concerning the gala-priests, they were lamentation priests or cultic performers, who played the balag (probably both a harp and a drum) and recited dirges at funerals, as well as diverse kinds of lamentations (Black 1991). They are thought to have been eunuchs or the like. The word gala is written with the sign sequence UŠ.KU, the first sign having also the reading giš3 (“penis”), and the second one, dur2 (“anus”), so perhaps there is some pun involved.

Moreover, gala is homophonous with gal4-la “vulva.” However, in spite of all the references to their alleged effeminate character (especially in the Sumerian proverbs), many administrative texts mention gala-priests who had children, wives, and large families (Rubio 2001: 270; Michałowski 2006). On the other hand, some gala-priests were actually women (al-Rawi 1992). The emesal forms are characterized by phonetic substitutions: /z/ corresponds to standard Sumerian /d/ (udu “sheep” m e-ze2); /b/ to /g/ (dug3
“good” m ze2-eb), and so forth. Thus, Jacobsen (1988: 131) argued that emesal was a style of Sumerian distinguished by a “shift of articulation forward in the mouth” (i.e., palatalization), rather than an actual dialect. However, emesal also presents some specific words that cannot be explained by phonetic correspondences (such as gašan “lady,” instead of nin). Likewise, some morphological substitutions do not fit Jacobsen’s proposal; e.g., the cohortative verbal prefix /ga-/ appears as da- or du5- in emesal. Thus, other alternatives have been put forward. It has been argued that emesal was a regional dialect (Bobrova and Militarev 1989). Moreover, it has also been regarded as a literary dialect based on the dialectal features of an area associated with these compositions, perhaps because its women were well-known performers (Bachvarova 1997). In fact, some typical emesal sound shifts may be found sporadically in some texts from third-millennium Lagash (Bauer 1998: 435–36). In sum, emesal may have originally stemmed from an actual regional dialect or from the particular dialect of a certain group (such as a genderlect). However, as we have it attested, in most cases, the occurrence of emesal forms may be determined mostly by the genre of the text, rather than by the gender of the fictional speaker or even the performer.
Literature and history
Many modern scholars try to search for a historical kernel allegedly hidden at the core of many Mesopotamian literary, mythological, and religious compositions. Entire modern scholarly myths have been built on reading literature as if it were ultimately a historiographic palimpsest. Mythological compositions are frequently interpreted as romans à clef, whose protagonists (deities) stand for specific cities or regions and therefore enact a mythical translation of historical events. If a Sumerian god (Enki, Enlil) appears in opposition to Inanna/Ishtar (goddess of Akkade), a conflict between two cities is swiftly postulated, against the usual background of ethnic fallacies in which, for instance, Inanna/Ishtar personifies “the Semitic” (Rubio 2007b: 23–31). Any modestly sophisticated reader would find such interpretations of myths rather uncouth. Nonetheless, other instances of this historicist approach are more complex. A good example is the alleged resentment
32 Sumerian Literature



against the Sargonic dynasty that would constitute the core and raison d’être of the Curse of Akkade, attested already in Ur III tablets. This represents an important element in the modern debate on ethnicity in Mesopotamia. As mentioned above, the alleged tensions between Akkadians (Semites) and Sumerians would have materialized in the transition from the Sargonic to the Ur III period. However, the historical assumption behind this interpretation is deeply problematic, as there is no real evidence of an ethnic conflict between Semitic speakers and speakers of Sumerian (Becker 1985; Rubio 2007b: 26–31). Another often-repeated assumption pertains to the theory of early assemblies. It has been postulated that there was a Pre-Sargonic assembly (Sumerian ukkin or unken) of city rulers. However, there is no historical trace of a Pre-Sargonic assembly of rulers from different cities, which would have met at Nippur and would have somehow mirrored the divine assembly over which Anu and Enlil presided (Cooper 2001: 136).12 Likewise, early cities would have had their own city assemblies, whose hypothetical existence provides the basis for the scholarly construct of “primitive democracy” in Early Mesopotamia. The terminology of Mesopotamian kingship is well known, although not always fully understood. The archaic texts from Uruk often mention an en, a word that simply means “lord” but which later on became also the name of the office of high priest. In Ur III and Old Babylonian Sumerian literary compositions about early legendary kings, Enmerkar is called “en of Uruk” and Gilgamesh is “en of Kullaba” (Uruk was the result of the merger of two settlements: Eanna and Kullaba). In Early Dynastic inscriptions and documents, one finds two Sumerian offices, lugal (“king”) and ensi2 (“prince, governor”), the latter generally translated as “ruler” when it occurs in early texts. During the third millennium, the title ensi2 does not always indicate a secondary ruler, subject to a king (lugal), but rather the rhetorical device to mark the ruler’s subordination to a god. For example, Gudea is the ensi2 of Lagash because he exercises vicarious sovereignty on behalf of Ningirsu, god of Girsu and patron of Lagash, the same way that an Assyrian king would call himself the iššaku (Akkadian translation of Sumerian ensi2) of the god Assur. Nevertheless, already in Sargonic and Ur III texts, the term ensi2 often refers to a civilian governor of a province or region subject to the kings of Akkad or Ur. There is not, however, a single trace of any sort of supranational assembly of rulers in Early Mesopotamia, as many have postulated. The issue of city assemblies and “primitive democracy” is also predicated on reading literature as a charter for historical and political reconstruction. One of the poems of the Sumerian Gilgamesh cycle, Gilgamesh and Agga, is frequently adduced as an example of an assembly system holding decisive power in early Mesopotamia. At the beginning of the story, Gilgamesh speaks before the elders (ab-ba) of his city and then before the able-bodied
Gonzalo Rubio 33



men (guruš) of his city. Based on this episode, some have argued that Uruk had a sort of bicameral system, consisting of an assembly of elders and an assembly of young men.13 However, this composition exhibits several binary patterns, including the contrast between ab-ba and guruš. Thus, the “bicameral” scenario is a metonymic reflection of the parallelistic structure of the poem, a literary trope rather than evidence of a historical institution.
HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
Early Sumerian Literature
Among the archaic texts from Uruk, there may be at least one literary text of sorts. The “Tribute List” is attested in almost sixty witnesses and fragments from the Late Uruk period, several Early Dynastic tablets from Fara, Abu S+alabh, and Ebla—the latter in northern Syria—an unpublished Ur III fragment from Nippur, and two Old Babylonian versions.14 The composition has ninety-four lines. One whole section (twenty-four lines) is repeated line by line and sign by sign. Such a repetition would play no role in an administrative document or in a lexical list, but it is not uncommon in a literary text. Moreover, the first two lines of the composition can be interpreted as an introductory formula typical of many Sumerian literary compositions. The composition starts with the word “when” (u4) and mentions a “counsel” or “counselor” and a temple official (abrig, Akkadian abarakkum) who was entrusted with some secrets (ad-hal). Unfortunately, our defective knowledge of the archaic texts does not allow for a detailed translation of the composition. In the following period (Early Dynastic I-II), one finds another possible early example of a text exhibiting literary devices in the “Figure aux plumes” from Telloh (ancient Girsu, near Lagash), which is essentially an early land-sale document inscribed on stone (Wilcke 1995). Due to the rather elliptic nature of early spelling conventions and the difficulties of these texts, the proposed instances of early Sumerian literature remain as tantalizing as elusive. The Early Dynastic III period, in the mid third millennium, truly marks the beginning of Sumerian (as well as Semitic or Akkadian) literature in Mesopotamia (Krebernik 1998: 317–25). The two main sources of literary texts in Early Dynastic Sumer are Fara (ancient Shuruppak) and Abuu SS+alabh (whose ancient name remains unknown). To a lesser extent, Lagash (modern Tell al-Hibaa), Girsu (Telloh or Telloo), Adab (Bismaaya), and Nippur itself (Niffar or Atlaa1 Nufar, in al-Qaadisīyah) have also yielded a few literary texts dating to this period. Outside Mesopotamia, three Syrian sites Ebla (modern Tell Mardīh), Nabada (Tell Beydar), and Mari (Tell arīrī) provide us with a small handful of Sumerian literary texts as well. Ebla is of particular importance in these matters. Although the local language (Eblaite) was Se
34 Sumerian Literature



mitic and very close to Akkadian, the texts from Ebla (lexical lists included) belong to a cultural and scribal continuum that stretches from Sumer (FFaara, Abu S+alabīh) to northern Syria (Rubio 2006b: 110–23). Along with a few incantations, the FFaara literary corpus includes a number of proverbs, most of which have duplicates in AAbbuu S+alabīh (Alster 19911992). Moreover, there are other compositions, such as one mentioning the goddess Sud (dsud3) the patroness of Shuruppak (SF 36; Krebernik 1998: 340). Another tablet contains a composition referring probably to Sud and her temple (SF 40; Alster 1976: 21–23; Krebernik 1998: 340). Furthermore, there are also several compositions mentioning the deity Ama’ušumgal, or Ama’ušumgalanna, who in Early Dynastic FFaara wwaass ssttiillll aa ddiissttiinncctt ggoodd bbuutt whose name became identified with Dumuzi by the late Sargonic period (Krebernik 2003: 165–69; Fritz 2003: 174–75). There are a few other literary texts from FFaara, but the nature of Early Dynastic spelling and their elusive references cause them to remain difficult to understand (Krebernik 1998: 317–25). Whereas at Early Dynastic sites such as FFaara and Lagash, administrative documents are much more numerous than literary texts, at AAbbuu S+alabīh literature represents the majority of the corpus. There is a particularly interesting tablet containing a story about Lugalbanda and the goddess Ninsun, whose plot seems unparalleled in narratives from other periods (IAS 327; Jacobsen 1989). There are also other texts that can be identified as literary, even if they cannot be fully understood (e.g., IAS 282 and 283; Krebernik 1998: 317–25). The Early Dynastic Sumerian corpus includes earlier versions of compositions well known in later periods, especially in the Old Babylonian, such as the Kesh Temple Hymn (Biggs 1971; Wilcke 2006) and the Instructions of Shuruppak (Alster 2005a: 176–94), both preserved in several tablets and fragments from AAbbuu S+alabīh. Nonetheless, most compositions attested at AAbbuu S+alabīh are unique; e.g., the hymnic Self-Praise of Inanna (IAS 329, 388, and two other small fragments; Krebernik 1998: 366), and a composition mentioning the Sun-god Utu (IAS 389; Krebernik 1998: 368). Furthermore, the uniqueness of some early compositions can hide surprises that go beyond the philological complexities of early Sumerian, and such is the case of Ashnan and her Seven Children (IAS 283–87, 288–296; Krebernik 1998: 365). Although Ashnan (“Grain”) is well known in later disputation poems, her seven children are mentioned only in this Early Dynastic composition (Civil 1983b: 45). Sometimes one can find duplicates of the same composition in more than one Early Dynastic site, as is the case of a hymn to Ama’ušumgal attested in Abu S+alabīh (IAS 278), Ebla, and probably in Mari as well (Bonechi and Durand 1992; Krebernik 2003: 165–66, 171–77; Fritz 2003: 169–72). An important subcorpus at AAbbuu S+alabīh is that of the zami hymns (spelled za3-mi3, instead of the later za3-mi2), attested in twenty-one tablets
Gonzalo Rubio 35



and fragments. The zami hymns comprise about seventy sequences, each of which begins with a toponym and ends with the name of the deity of that place followed by the formula zami (Biggs 1974: 44–56). It is difficult to call them hymns when in fact 80% of them do not go over two or three lines (Krecher 1992: 292–93). Thus, the label litany would probably be more accurate. For instance (lines 186–87):
isinX(IN) bulug(NAGAR) an-ki nin-isinx(IN) za3-mi3
Isin, pole of heaven and earth —Praise upon Ninisina!
The corpus of Early Dynastic literature includes a very peculiar group of texts known as UD.GAL.NUN (Krecher 1992). They are written in a unique orthography labeled as UD.GAL.NUN because this is the way the name of the god Enlil (den-lil2) is spelled in those texts; i.e., in this spelling, UD = DINGIR, GAL = EN, and NUN = LIL2. Unfortunately, most of the other sign correspondences remain murky when not completely unknown. Moreover, no UD.GAL.NUN text has been found at Ebla. All of them date to the Early Dynastic period and come from Fara aanndd AAAbbbuuu S+alabīh. Rather than a use of cryptography, all of these apparently substitutional mechanisms may well reflect an early attempt to devise an alternative orthography for Sumerian texts.15 Lagash and Girsu are well known for their large administrative archives from the third millennium. Nevertheless, a few Early Dynastic literary texts do come from these two sites. At Lagash, a composition combining names of canals, deities and their epithets, fish, and snakes constitutes a collection of riddles without the answers—as opposed to the later Old Babylonian riddles, which do include answers (Civil 1987b)—although some prefer to classify it simply as a literary enumeration (Biggs 1973; Marchesi 1999: 3). Literary enumerations serve both as a common device and as a compositional template in Sumerian literature (Civil 1987a: 37–38; Rubio 2003). Within the same enumerative tradition, there are two other literary texts from Lagash characterized by their inventories of field names, canals, and cultic places (Marchesi 1999). A royal inscription of Urukagina (Ukg. 16) can actually be regarded as a literary narrative of Umma’s attack against Lagash (Bauer 1998: 489–92; Wilcke 2004: 215–16). A small tablet from Girsu, originally labeled as if it were a royal inscription of Urukagina (Ukg. 15), contains a cosmogonic narrative, which refers to a primeval time: u4-ba en-ki nun-ki nu-sig7 “at that time, the ‘lords of the earth’ and ‘princes of the earth’ did not exist” (ii 3; Sjöberg 2002: 229–39). From Early Dynastic Nippur comes one of the best-known Sumerian compositions of this period, the so-called Barton Cylinder (named after its first editor). This twenty-column cylinder contains a composition
36 Sumerian Literature



concerned with the interruption of food supplies for Nippur after the primordial creation of fertility (Alster and Westenholz 1994). Both Enlil and Ninurta are featured prominently in the story. There is also a fragment from Nippur, which mentions Enlil, his son Iškur, and a fox (Schwemer 2001: 166, 179–80). Nippur has yielded a few other literary texts, which have survived in fragmentary fashion and remain therefore difficult to understand (Westenholz 1975: 11–12, 122–24). From Adab, we have a composition mentioning Nanshe (Krecher 1992: 287–88) and, more importantly, a version of the Instructions of Shuruppak (Alster 2005a: 195–203). There are also a couple of isolated Early Dynastic literary texts from two other major sites, Ur and Uruk (Biggs 1974: 29 n. 8; Krebernik 1998: 317 n. 762). The Syrian periphery has yielded some examples of Sumerian literature. Along with the previously mentioned Mari text (Bonechi and Durand 1992), there is a composition referring to Enki found at Tell Beydar, ancient Nabada (Sallaberger 2004). Besides the duplicates of the Ama’ušumgal hymn and the so-called Tribute List already described, Ebla has also yielded a royal hymn of sorts, structured as an enumeration (Krebernik 1997).
The Ur III Period
Even before the discovery of any Ur III manuscripts of Sumerian compositions attested in the Old Babylonian period, it was argued that the majority of the Sumerian literary compositions known to us in Old Babylonian copies were originally composed not later than the Ur III period (Falkenstein 1951). In fact, a couple of Ur III literary catalogues list incipits of compositions (Hallo 1963; Civil 1975: 145 n. 36). At least two of the compositions found in these Ur III catalogues are attested in the Old Babylonian period (two royal hymns of Shulgi and Ur-Namma respectively). As seen above, however, the earliest manuscripts of some compositions, such as the Instructions of Shuruppak and the Kesh Temple Hymn, date to the Early Dynastic period. Nevertheless, in the stream of tradition of Sumerian literature, from the Early Dynastic tablets found in FFaara aanndd AAbbuu S+alabīh to the so-called classical Old Babylonian Sumerian texts, the time of the III Dynasty of Ur plays a role that is as essential as it is insufficiently known. When one thinks of the Ur III period, the first thing that comes to mind is the vast corpus of administrative documents generated by its bureaucratic system. However, besides the administrative corpus and the royal inscriptions, there are a few literary texts dating to this period. Overlapping the end of the Sargonic period and the beginning of Ur III, there is a royal inscription, attested only in Old Babylonian copies, containing a literary composition about Utu-hegal’s victory over the Gutians, The Victory of Utuhegal (Frayne 1993: 283–93). Moreover, the two cylinders of Gudea, ruler of Lagash, constitute an interesting and rather unique case. The Gudea
Gonzalo Rubio 37



hymn on these two cylinders concerns the rebuilding and dedication of the Eninnu temple complex in Lagash and is one of the masterpieces of Sumerian literature, as well as the longest literary text from the third millennium (Jacobsen 1987: 386–444; Edzard 1997). Furthermore, there are other Ur III literary texts found in the debris of the temple of Inanna in the city of Nippur.16 Some of them have parallels in other periods, especially in Old Babylonian Nippur, as is the case of, for instance, the fragments of Lugalbanda I, the Curse of Akkade, the Temple hymns, and the Fields of Ninurta—the latter being the Sumerian composition best attested in the Ur III literary corpus from Nippur. Others are known to us only in these Ur III tablets: several incantations, a small fragment of a composition about

Gilgamesh, a hymn to the goddess Nidaba, a Ninimma lament, and so forth.17 Although it may seem counterintuitive, Ur III versions of compositions attested later on in Old Babylonian do not necessarily offer a more reliable text. For instance, as interesting as they are for matters of spelling, the Ur III manuscripts of the Curse of Akkade show some obvious scribal mistakes and confusions (Cooper 1983: 43–44). Thus, an earlier avatar of a composition does not always represent an earlier stage of development; sometimes it is simply an earlier and even a lower-quality copy. Unfortunately, the fragmentary state of many of these textual remnants frequently provides only tantalizing glimpses, as in the case of a cosmogonic composition preserved in a fragment containing just a few lines (Sjöberg 2002: 239–44). Furthermore, there are additional Ur III compositions, some of which were found and originally published alongside Old Babylonian tablets. Frequently, the date of these other compositions is established on a paleographic and philological basis but is not fully certain, since early Old Babylonian literary texts can look very much like their Ur III counterparts (e.g., Sjöberg 1988).
The Old Babylonian Period
The Old Babylonian period is commonly regarded as the “classical” age of Sumerian literature. This view reflects an ancient phenomenon of textual canonization, which took place at the Old Babylonian edubbas in Southern Mesopotamia (Vanstiphout 2003c). As seen above, the original setting for most Sumerian literary compositions is a cultural and social institution known as the edubba (e2-dub-ba or e2-dub-ba-a “school”). It is precisely in the Old Babylonian period that Sumerian literature and the edubba seem most closely intertwined. During the third and second millennia, tablets containing literary, religious, and scholarly compositions often appear linked to the institution—when not to the physical reality—of the edubba.18 These tablets are found in what seem to be private houses, and there is no evidence of temple or palace libraries in southern Mesopotamia during the Old Babylonian period.19 A few excavated houses can be identified as edubbas, i.e., as places of schooling, at this period: house F in Nippur (Robson 2001); the house of Ur-Utu in Sippar-Amnaanum, modern Tell edDer (Tanret 2002); house 7 on Quiet Street and house 1 on Broad Street at Ur (Charpin 1986); and a house at Mê-Turran or Meturan, modern Tell H3addaad, near the border between Iraq and Iran (Cavigneaux 1999). Similar institutions probably existed at Susa (in western Iran), as suggested by a variety of school exercises found there, including mathematical, lexical, and literary texts (Tanret 1986; Civil 1967: 209). Modern scholars have achieved an understanding of how scribes learned Sumerian and which kinds of texts they copied at different stages of their
Gonzalo Rubio 39



training (Vanstiphout 1979; Veldhuis 1997: 12–83). In fact, a rather clear picture of the curriculum of the Old Babylonian schools at Nippur can now be drawn. The apprentices of scribes began by copying lexical texts having an increasing level of difficulty: simple lists of syllabic signs and name lists; the encyclopedic compendium of series of objects plants, and animals entitled HAR-ra = hubullu (“debt, loan”), also known simply as HAR-ra or ur5-ra; the diri list, which contains compound signs whose reading cannot be easily deduced from their elements (diri “to exceed, excess” is written SI.A); and so forth. In spite of the death of Sumerian by the end of the third millennium, the Old Babylonian copies of most lexical lists are still monolingual; the Old Babylonian diri list (Proto-diri) is one of the few exceptions in including Akkadian translations already. In general, the Old Babylonian teacher would orally provide students with Akkadian translations that did not make it into the written stream of tradition until the last centuries of the second millennium. Near the end of the lexical training, pupils would deal with some mathematical texts, mostly multiplication tables and tables of reciprocals. The path toward literary texts would begin by copying model texts (model contracts and business documents) and proverbs (Veldhuis 2000b). The literary curriculum can be divided into several grades, so to speak (Vanstiphout 1999: 83; Michałowski 2003a: 111):
• 1st grade: proverbs, fables, short didactic pieces, including simple compositions devised to provide grammatical training, such as Lipit-Eshtar hymn B (Vanstiphout 1978, 1979). • 2nd grade: school texts (i.e., compositions set in the school milieu), debates, and longer didactic pieces—the Farmer’s Instructions or Georgica (Civil 1994), the Instructions of Shuruppak (Alster 2005a: 31–220), and the Instructions of Ur-Ninurta (Alster 2005a: 221–40). • 3rd grade: hymns, odes, performative texts (songs, laments), and literary letters. • 4th grade: major hymnic and lyric compositions, and “historical” literature (e.g., the Curse of Akkade). • 5th grade: major narratives about heroes and gods, and reflective poetry.
Within the setting of the Old Babylonian edubba, Tinney (1999a) has identified two sets of compositions that constituted curricular sequences: the Tetrad and the Decad. Copied in a series of four six-sided cylinders, among other manuscripts, the Tetrad consists of three royal hymns devoted to kings of Isin in the early second millennium (Iddin-Dagan B, Lipit-Eshtar B, and Enlil-bani A) together with a hymn to the goddess Nidaba (Nidaba A), the patroness of scribes.20 The compositions that form the Decad are listed in sequence in a famous literary catalogue from Old Babylonian Nippur and some of them were copied in the same order in a couple of manu

scripts (Delnero 2006). The Decad includes two royal hymns (Shulgi A and Lipit-Eshtar A), three hymns to deities (Inanna B or Ninmešarra, Enlil A or Enlilsuraše, and the Nungal hymn), a temple hymn (the Kesh Temple Hymn), three narratives (Enki’s Journey to Nippur, Inanna and Ebih, and Gilgamesh and Huwawa A), and a “paradigmatic composition” (the Song of the Hoe, written around the sign AL “hoe”). One should not ignore the fact that the Sumerian literary texts from Southern Babylonia represent a well-delimited and encapsulated segment of a stream of tradition (Michałowski 1995a: 2283). In the case of Nippur, what we have now most likely corresponds to the exercises and copies of the last two or three generations of scribes and pupils before Nippur was abandoned. As part of the devastation resulting from the fight that followed the rebellion started by a certain Rim-Anum at Uruk during the eighth year of the reign of Samsu-iluna (1749–1712), the population of Nippur fled north (Charpin 2004: 337–38). This rebellion against the Amorite dynasty of Babylon was continued by Rim-Sin II, who was probably the king of Larsa and son of Warad-Sin, but who regarded Kesh—the city whose temple was the object of the famous hymn, not to be confused with Kish—as the center of his power (Charpin 2004: 338–40). As a consequence of Samsuiluna’s actions against the rebels, or as an exile triggered by the Elamite intervention, or even as a result of the actions of the kings of the “Sea Land”—or for all these reasons—the fact is that, during the second half of the eighteenth century, the inhabitants of Uruk took refuge in Kish, the people of Larsa sought shelter in Babylon, and most Southerners seem to have abandoned their cities: first Ur, Uruk, and Larsa, and eventually Nippur and Isin as well (Charpin 2004: 342–46). Most of these southern sites remained abandoned for the most part for several centuries. It is for Nippur that we have the most detailed curricular information for this period, since so many Sumerian literary texts were recovered at private houses in Nippur and in Ur. Moreover, smaller sets of texts were found at other places in southern Babylonia, mostly Isin, Uruk, and Larsa.21 All these southern sites offer a similar array of compositions. Northern Babylonia, however, presents a different literary landscape, as attested in sites such as Sippar (Abuu HHabba), Babylon, Kish (al-Uhhaymir), Meturan or Mê-Turran (Tell HHaddaad), and Tell HHarmal (ancient Šaduppûm).22 To begin with, these northern Babylonian cities were not abandoned during the reign of Samsu-iluna, a phenomenon limited to the South. Rather, the opposite: Northern Babylonian cities seem to have grown and expanded due to the influx of the population fleeing the South. Moreover, the so-called emesal cultic compositions (laments, hymns, and prayers) dominate the literary scenario in the North, although Meturan seems closer to the southern tradition. As a phenomenon closely related to emesal, Old Babylonian Sumerian texts from northern Babylonia abound in syllabic and phonetic (“unortho
Gonzalo Rubio 41



graphic”) spellings; e.g., writing da-am instead of dam “spouse,” and du (DU = gen normally “to go”) instead of du3 “to build” (Thomsen 1984: 281–84). Similar unorthographic features can be identified in texts from Susa (in western Iran) and even in a few from Nippur (Civil 1967: 209). The northern Babylonian tradition came to an end with the sack of Babylon by the Hittite king Mursili I (1595). Although the northern tradition had outlived the southern one for over a century, no evidence of scribal activity or copying of Sumerian literature has been uncovered after Mursili’s attack and for about three centuries.
The Late Second Millennium
Sumerian literary texts reappear in the last three centuries of the second millennium. The textual hiatus that began with the aftermath of the rebellion against Samsu-iluna in Southern Babylonia (1741–1738) and Mursili’s sack of Babylon in the North (1595) may well stem from the serendipity with which texts are found in excavations. Nevertheless, the lack of findings in the South could also be explained by the migration from southern cities to northern Babylonia by 1738. Likewise, the Hittite attack on Babylon is likely to have triggered a migratory movement of scribes—along with other specialized and highly skilled individuals—to cities in the north of Mesopotamia and toward the East (Syria, Anatolia). Such a migration explains the spread of Mesopotamian literature into Syria and Anatolia. In the case of Assyria, however, the forays into Babylonia on the part of the Middle Assyrian kings Tukulti-Ninurta I and Tiglath-pileser I account for the occurrence of bilingual (Sumero-Akkadian) copies of some Sumerian literary compositions in Nineveh and Assur, as in the case of Angim and Lugale. Other Sumerian texts were obviously known in Assyria, as is proven by the existence of a monolingual tablet containing a few lines of an Akkadian translation (without the Sumerian original) of the Instructions of Shuruppak, which was found at Assur (Alster 2005a: 48, 207). Further proof is offered by a Middle Assyrian literary catalogue of Sumerian and Akkadian songs (Pedersén 1985: 35; 1986: 17–18, 21). In fact, the so-called library of Tiglath-pileser I contains at least twenty Sumero-Akkadian bilinguals, including several emesal compositions, and Nineveh has yielded a handful of Sumerian compositions as well (Cooper 1971–1972: 1–2).23 The second half of the second millennium is a period of internationalization of Mesopotamian literature. Primarily Akkadian literary texts—but also a few Sumerian ones, mostly in bilingual editions—are attested not only in Assyria (Assur and Nineveh) and Babylon, but also in Anatolia (Hattusa) and in Syria (Ugarit and Emar).24 A number of the Late Bronze period peripheral attestations of Sumerian literary texts exhibit the kinds of “unorthographic” or phonetic spellings that characterized the northern
42 Sumerian Literature



tradition in the Old Babylonian period. At Susa (in western Iran), two Middle-Babylonian tablets containing Sumero-Akkadian bilinguals of several literary letters of the Royal Correspondence of Ur abound in syllabic and phonetic spellings.25 In Hattusa (the Hittite capital), a hymn to the god Ishkur occurs in several multi-column fragments, including trilinguals (Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite), bilinguals (Sumerian and Hittite, Akkadian and Hittite), and another three-column version (standard Sumerian, phonetic Sumerian, and Hittite), which may point to the existence of a four-column version: standard Sumerian, syllabic Sumerian, Akkadian, and Hittite (Cooper 1971–1972: 5, 8). Furthermore, the Hattusa manuscript of the Message of Ludingirra to his Mother probably included four columns, as is the case of a duplicate found at Ugarit but probably written at Hattusa: standard Sumerian, phonetic Sumerian, Akkadian, and Hittite (Cooper 1971: 158 n. 8; 1971–1972: 5, 9). In Emar, the wisdom composition known as Enlil and Namzitarra occurs in several fragments from the same bilingual tablet, which also contained a monolingual Akkadian father-and-son instruction fragment (Kämmerer 1998: 113–17, 218–27; Alster 2005a: 330–38). In spite of the survival of several important Sumerian compositions, this period saw the disappearance, or at least drastic reduction, of the genres that lay at the core of the Ur III tradition and the Old Babylonian scribal curriculum: royal hymns, narratives concerning legendary kings (the epics of Enmerkar, Lugalbanda, and Gilgamesh), and various historiographic compositions (Michałowski 1995a: 2288). Nevertheless, at Babylon itself, Middle-Babylonian copies of a handful of literary texts have been found (Veldhuis 2000a: 85–86). However, Middle-Babylonian Babylon is representative of the tendency to discard certain genres and focus on others (Veldhuis 2000a): divine narratives, such as Enlil and Sud (Civil 1983), Inanna’s Descent, Lugale, and Angim (Cooper 1978); wisdom compositions, such as the Instructions of Ur-Ninurta, the Counsels of Wisdom and several proverbs (Alster 2005a: 221–25); and a few songs. In approaching texts from this period, one should bear in mind that, when the archaeological context is not sufficiently clear or textually homogenous, late Old Babylonian copies actually are difficult to distinguish from Middle Babylonian ones solely on the basis of paleography (Veldhuis 2000a: 69–70). This is the case of, for instance, a Sumero-Akkadian bilingual narrative about Sargon (Goodnick Westenholz 1997: 52–55; Veldhuis 2000a: 85–86).
The First Millennium
By the first millennium, Sumerian literary compositions are rarely attested in monolingual copies. Incantations are almost the only Sumerian texts preserved in monolingual tablets during this period, and this was probably merely a device to stress the mysterious nature of magic mechanisms

(somewhat like an abracadabra spell). Sumerian had ceased to be anyone’s mother tongue over a millennium earlier, and even the scribes needed Akkadian translations to fully understand Sumerian literature. These translations are frequently interlinear, which betrays their immediate utilitarian purpose. Moreover, in contrast with the Old Babylonian edubba, during the first millennium most scribes were working for specific institutions, such as Assurbanipal’s library, and therefore participating in a large endeavor with a clear aim: to produce accurate texts of compositions to be archived in such institutions. Some of these texts originated in private libraries, whereas others were produced exclusively with Assurbanipal’s project in mind, as many scribal colophons make clear (Parpola 1983). Whereas the Old Babylonian period is marked by the edubba as a social and cultural institution seemingly private in nature, the first millennium makes evident a tendency that was probably at work already in the Middle Babylonian period: Most scribes copying literary and scholarly compositions seem to be working now for temples and palaces. Most Sumerian texts from the first millennium come from Assur and especially Nineveh (Assurbanipal’s library). However, a few were found at Sultantepe (ancient Huzirina), in Anatolia, near the famous city of Edessa (modern Urfa). The Sultantepe texts include bilinguals of the ubiquitous Lugale, Enlil and Sud, cultic laments, and various cultic and narrative compositions (Civil 1967). The corpus of Sumerian literature from Assyria is not particularly large either, although it does include the expected bilingual copies of Lugale and Angim (Cooper 1971: 7 n. 30; Michałowski 1987: 3839). For instance, a hymn to the goddess Nintu, labeled with the subscript tigi, is attested in Old Babylonian and in Neo-Assyrian copies, the latter from Assurbanipal’s library at Nineveh (Wilcke 1975: 235–39). Moreover, given the apparent almost disappearance of narratives (“epics”) about Sumerian kings after the Old Babylonian period, it is quite surprising to find a couple of tablets containing sections of Lugalbanda II at Assurbanipal’s library as well (Wilcke 1969: 85). It is interesting to note that the spelling of the Sumerian texts in the bilinguals from Assurbanipal’s library at Nineveh is rather close to the Old Babylonian southern tradition, as exemplified by the Nippur corpus. One could perhaps expect these Neo-Assyrian manuscripts to stem from a northern tradition of spelling, such as that of Old Babylonian Sippar. However, the Old Babylonian Nippur tradition resurfaces in these Nineveh bilinguals. In fact, the Neo-Assyrian manuscripts of compositions such as Lugale and Angim are better, in terms of spelling and variants, and closer to the Old Babylonian tradition than the Middle Assyrian manuscripts. The link may lie in Middle Babylonian Nippur. After Nippur was mostly abandoned as a consequence of the repression that followed the revolt against Samsuiluna in the second half of the eighteenth century, the site seems to have
44 Sumerian Literature



been occupied again after 1400. Nevertheless, the size and population of Nippur decreased substantially after 1225, and did not recover until about 750. As the natural gateway to the tribal areas in southern Mesopotamia, Nippur was passed back and forth between Assyrians and Chaldeans for a century, until Assurbanipal took direct control of the city in 651 (Cole 1996: 13–22). The few Sumerian and Sumero-Akkadian texts from Middle Babylonian Nippur seem to continue the orthographic tradition of Old Babylonian Nippur (Veldhuis 2000a). Thus, it is possible that the Old Babylonian southern tradition somehow survived at Nippur and was eventually transplanted to Nineveh in the seventh century. First-millennium Babylonia has yielded a rather small corpus of Sumerian literature. This includes copies of Lugale and Angim, and two bilingual manuscripts of Enlil and Ninlil (Behrens 1978: 8; Cooper 1980: 176). In fact, Lugale was such a staple of Sumerian literature that it survived all the way to the Late Babylonian period, after Cyrus’ conquest of Babylon in 539. Moreover, since Sumerian proverbs provided an ideal vehicle for scribal training (short sentences easy to copy), they are also represented in the small Neo-Babylonian corpus, as they were before in almost all periods and all areas, from Nippur to Susa. Probably the only kinds of Sumerian literary compositions that remained well represented until the very end of the first millennium, are the cultic laments and dirges (balags and eršemmas) and the eršahunga prayers. For instance, the cultic lament (balag) known as uru ammairrabi (uru2 am3-ma-ir-ra-bi “this city, which has been looted”) is preserved even in Late Babylonian and Seleucid-period bilingual copies (Volk 1989: 6–8). Likewise, even after 539, scribes kept copying a composition known by its incipit, In the Desert, in the Early Grass (eden-a u2-sag-ga), which was a mixture of hymnic and narrative sections and was catalogued as a balag song, a cultic lament (Alster 1986; Jacobsen 1987: 56–84; Fritz 2003: 178–83). The resilience of these hymnic and lament compositions is closely tied with their liturgical role. Thus, the singularity of their endurance is probably a sign of how dissociated from the properly literary corpus balags, eršemmas, and eršahungas had eventually become.
Sumerian was kept in use alongside Akkadian all the way to the end of the Mesopotamian civilization in the Parthian period. The very last cuneiform texts are usually called “Graeco-Babyloniaca,” as they include a Greek transliteration of the Sumerian and/or Akkadian originals (Geller 1997); e.g., ki-sikil lil2-la2 CISCIL LILA (khiskhil lila) “the Maiden-demon” (Akkadian ardat lilî). These were the final attempts at keeping a 3,000-year-old tradition alive, and the very last texts may be as late as the first century C.E. Nevertheless, bits and pieces of the Mesopotamian literary tradition survived in the later Near East (Dalley 1998). An example of this minimal survival can be found in the fragmentarily preserved Babylonica of Berossus, dating to the Hellenistic period (Komoróczy 1973; Verbrugghe and
Gonzalo Rubio 45



Wickersham 2000: 13–91). Moreover, distant echoes of various Mesopotamian religious, cultural, and technical traditions surface in the Arabic treatise Kitaab al-filaaha n-nabaiyya (“The Book of the Nabatean Agriculture”), whose own preface claims that it had been written originally in Syriac by the Babylonian agronomist Quutama and then translated into Arabic by Ibn Whašiyya at the beginning of the tenth century CE. For instance, the Nabatean Agriculture contains a passage describing a lament over Tammuz (Hämeen-Anttila 2006: 226–31). In many ways, these were the minute vestiges of a gargantuan shipwreck, whose pieces have been—and still are—progressively recovered and laboriously put back together by generations of modern scholars, throughout the last century and a half and for many years to come.
MAJOR GENRES AND COMPOSITIONS
Narrative Cycles on Legendary Kings
The two narratives on Enmerkar and the two on Lugalbanda constitute what Vanstiphout (1995, 2003a) has called “the matter of Aratta.”26 The matter of Aratta consists of four rather long narrative poems dealing with the conflict between the city of Uruk and the city of Aratta, and their respective rulers, Enmerkar and Ensuhkeshdanna (or Ensuhgiranna).27 Uruk (modern Warka) is of course the famous Southern Mesopotamian city that became a wide-reaching cultural center during the fourth and early third millennia. Behind the Aratta of the poems there may be a real Aratta lurking in the background, a city in Iran. Nevertheless, Aratta is rarely mentioned outside literary texts, and even then it seems to denote the embodiment of luxury and abundance, a sort of Xanadu or El Dorado; for example, it occurs in Early Dynastic lexical lists (from FFaara) mostly qualifying objects such as a type of bronze vessel. The first part of the matter of Aratta is the cycle of Enmerkar, as found in the compositions Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta and Enmerkar and Ensuhkeshdanna. The second part is the cycle of Lugalbanda, the youngest (and eighth) brother of the seven commanders chosen by Enmerkar to conquer Aratta. The cycle of Lugalbanda consists of two poems usually known as Lugalbanda I and Lugalbanda II.
Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta (S. Cohen 1970; Vanstiphout 2003a: 4996; COS 1: 547–50) is one of the most interesting and complex Sumerian narrative poems. Enmerkar, ruler of Uruk, wants to procure some precious metals and stones, which are absent in southern Mesopotamia but abound in Aratta. Enmerkar questions the goddess Inanna about how to proceed. Inanna is the goddess of both Uruk and Aratta, but she is obviously on
46 Sumerian Literature



Enmerkar’s side. Inanna tells Enmerkar that he should send a messenger to Aratta. The messenger from Uruk must obtain the desired raw materials by letting the lord of Aratta know that Inanna favors Enmerkar and that he must recognize the ruler of Uruk as his superior. The lord of Aratta, who remains unnamed in this composition, replies that he will comply only if Enmerkar can solve a series of impossible tasks, such as carrying grain in nets instead of bags. Enmerkar is able to solve the ingenious riddles; for instance, he puts sprouting barley in the nets so it does not fall through the interstices. As a culmination to this series of clever achievements, Enmerkar invents cuneiform writing. In Enmerkar and Ensuhkeshdanna, the roles are switched and it is now the lord of Aratta, Ensuhkeshdanna, who demands that Enmerkar acknowledge him as the favorite of Inanna and superior to the Sumerian ruler (Berlin 1979; Vanstiphout 2003a: 23–48). Enmerkar refuses and Ensuhkeshdanna feels humiliated but keeps trying by other means. On behalf of Aratta, a sorcerer goes to Sumer and causes the cows and goats of the city of Eresh to withhold their milk. Two shepherds ask the Sun-god Utu for help and he sends them a wise woman. She enters a competition with the sorcerer: The latter brings out five consecutive animals that are eaten by five beasts produced in turn by the wise woman. The defeated sorcerer’s life is taken away from him, which brings rejuvenation to withering Sumer. Finally, Ensuhkeshdanna has to submit to Enmerkar.
Lugalbanda I is also known as Lugalbanda in Hurrum, Lugalbanda in Hurrumkurra, Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave, and Lugalbanda in the Wilderness (Vanstiphout 2003a: 99–131). Moreover, Lugalbanda II is also known as Lugalbanda and Anzu, Lugalbanda and the Thunderbird, Lugalbanda and Enmerkar, and The Return of Lugalbanda (WWiillcckkee 11996699;; VVVaaannnssstttiiippphhhooouuuttt 222000000333aaa::: 132–59). Both poems deal with the vicissitudes experienced by a young hero, Lugalbanda, who is included in the Sumerian King List as a ruler of Uruk. In the first one, Lugalbanda becomes sick on the way to Aratta and his brothers leave him in a cave. His cunning and worship of the gods cause him to survive. In the continuation, our hero obtains from the mythical bird Anzu a gift, which he must keep secret: the ability to run extremely fast. It is this newly acquired talent that allows Lugalbanda to play an essential role in the final conquest of Aratta as Enmerkar’s courier, fetching instructions from the goddess Inanna in Uruk. Gilgamesh, the legendary lord of Kullaba (i.e., ruler of Uruk), is the subject of several narrative poems: Gilgamesh and Huwawa (preserved in two versions, A and B); Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven; Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld; and The Death of Gilgamesh.28 Some of these compositions correspond to episodes that were later integrated into the Babylonian Gilgamesh (Gilgamesh and Huwawa; Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven). Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld was eventually translated into Akkadian
Gonzalo Rubio 47



and added as an unnecessary and obvious prosthesis to the Babylonian Gilgamesh: the spurious tablet XII (George 2003: 47–54). However, Gilgamesh and Agga was ignored by the later Akkadian tradition. In Gilgamesh and Huwawa, the Uruk hero goes on an expedition to the cedar forest in order to defeat its keeper and guardian, the monster Huwawa (Edzard 1990–1991, 1993; Civil 2003). Gilgamesh and his sidekick, Enkidu, are able to trick Huwawa into giving up his seven “fearful auras” (ni2 te) or “frightening splendors” (me-lam4), which protect him like a coat of mail. Once Huwawa has removed his protections, they move in for the kill. However, Gilgamesh takes pity on the monster’s plea for mercy, and it is Enkidu who kills Huwawa. There are some humoristic details in this composition. For instance, in tricking Huwawa to give up his protections, Gilgamesh promises him his older and younger sisters in marriage. However, the names Gilgamesh gives as his sisters’ names constitute a multi-layered joke (Michałowski 2003b). The older one is Enmebaragesi—or Enishibbaragesi (ME = išib)—a legendary king of Kish said to have been the father of Agga. To offer an old (mostly fictional) king to be the monster’s wife must have had a comic effect. The younger sister’s name is Peshtur (peš3-tur), which can be taken literally as “little fig.” However, the name can be read Matur as well (MA = peš3), which can be understood as “she is too small for me” (ma-tur), in reference to the size of a woman’s vagina and with some literary parallels (Michałowski 2003b: 199).29
In Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld (Cavigneaux and al-Rawi 2000b; George 2003: 743–77; Gadotti 2005), Inanna wants a mortal to make a bed from a halub tree (Akkadian huluppu). Gilgamesh fulfills the goddess’s requests but he also makes himself two objects, probably a ball (ellag, Akkadian pukku) and a stick (E.KID, Akkadian mekkû). With these two objects, Gilgamesh plays a game while riding piggy-back on some young boys, whose widowed mothers complain. In any event, the two implements end up falling into the Netherworld. Enkidu volunteers to recover them but Gilgamesh warns him not to visit the dead. Enkidu goes to the Netherworld anyway and is unable to return. Nevertheless, Gilgamesh invokes Enkidu’s ghost, who comes back to describe to the ruler life in the Netherworld. Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven (Cavigneaux and al-Rawi 1993) is a narrative reminiscent of the Greek story of Hippolytus, Aphrodite, and Phaedra, as in Euripides’ Hippolytus. Gilgamesh rejects Inanna’s advances, so the scorned goddess goes to her father, An, and asks him to send the Bull of Heaven to kill Gilgamesh. With Enkidu’s help, Gilgamesh kills the bull instead. The essentials of the plot are reprised in tablet VII of the Babylonian Gilgamesh. Moreover, there is an interesting composition preserved fragmentarily and known as the Tale of Gudam, which was probably a variant of Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven (Alster 2004; Gadotti 2006). In The Death of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh lies dying and dreams that not even he can escape death (Cavigneaux and al-Rawi 2000a). In that dream, he is told about the burial and mourning
48 Sumerian Literature



rituals that will take place after his death. His son, Urlugal, builds his tomb, and Gilgamesh dies knowing that his name will be remembered because of the statues erected in his honor (Veldhuis 2001). Gilgamesh and Agga is a rather unusual story (Römer 1980, Cooper 1981, Jacobsen 1987: 345–55; Katz 1993; COS 1: 550–52). It takes place during a war between the ruler of Uruk, Gilgamesh, and Agga, the ruler of Kish. Agga sends a message to Gilgamesh and asks him to surrender. Gilgamesh seeks the advice of first an assembly of elders and later an assembly of ablebodied men (see section on “Literature and History” above). The elders are cautious but the young men are not afraid of fighting. During Agga’s siege of Uruk, one of Gilgamesh’s men sends his slave to fight the Kishites on behalf of the ruler of Uruk. This sort of vicarious heroism and confrontation by proxy fails, however; but when Enkidu is sent along with a contingent, he is able to capture Agga. Having shown his superiority, Gilgamesh releases Agga in reward for the latter’s kindness in the past. The fact that the composition begins in medias res and refers to events that are not part of the narrative, confers a rather elliptical character upon the composition. This has elicited a significant number of studies dealing with many questions of both structure and detail.30 For instance, the brevity of the composition (115 lines), its beginning in medias res, and its elusiveness have triggered the suggestion that the text as preserved in the manuscripts is only a template of the story, a score of sorts that could be expanded during any kind of oral recitation (Civil 1999–2000). Moreover, some grammatical oddities have led to the theory that, in contrast to other Sumerian compositions on Gilgamesh, this one would date to the early Old Babylonian period, from the area of Isin (Wilcke 1998). Assyriologists usually label these compositions epics; however, as was pointed out above, folktale may be a more accurate description.31 For instance, in the oral tradition of Khalkha literature in Mongolia, there are two genres corresponding to what westerners call epic: baGaturliG üliger (Heldenmärchen, Reckenmärchen) “tales about heroes or warriors,” and baGaturliG domoG (Heldensagen) “legends about heroes” (Heissig 1991). The latter Khalkha category seems to fit better the Sumerian stories about Enmerkar and Gilgamesh. Moreover, the Aratta cycle, especially the two Enmerkar poems, are representative of the cross-cultural genre of riddle tales (HasanRokem and Shulman 1996). Famous examples of riddle tales can be found in the pra ́sna (verbal puzzles, ingenious questions) typical of Indian literature, such as the third parvan (the Forest Book) of the Mahabharata, in which the Paandavas question their misfortune after a twelve-year exile in the wilderness. Furthermore, the Gilgamesh cycle in Sumerian somehow resembles the miscellaneous genre known as epyllion (small epos), typical of the Hellenistic period, in which mythic materials are fashioned into brief narrative poems (Fantuzzi and Hunter 2004: 191–245).

Mythic Narratives
This category should be reserved for compositions that contain a true narrative featuring a deity or deities. There are mythic compositions, such as The Fields of Ninurta (Rubio 2000: 203, 209), which can hardly be classified as either narratives or hymns, as they are poetic enumerations of items pertaining to the deity in question (Civil 1987a; Rubio 2003). The mythic narratives with significant plot can be divided by the deities that played the protagonist role in each of them:
• Dumuzi: Dumuzi and Geshtinanna (Sladek 1974: 225–39); Dumuzi and his Sisters (Black 2004); and Dumuzi’s Dream (Alster 1972).
• Enki: Enki and Ninhursag (Attinger 1984); Enki and Ninmah (Benito 1969; COS 1: 516–18); Enki and the World Order (Benito 1969); Enki’s Journey to Nippur (al-Fouadi 1969); and Enki in Nippur (Ludwig 2006). • Enlil: Enlil and Ninlil (Behrens 1978; Cooper 1980) and Enlil and Sud (Civil 1983b). • Inanna: Inanna and Enki (Farber-Flügge 1973; COS 1: 522–26); Inanna and Ebih (Attinger 1998); Inanna and Shukaletuda (Volk 1995); Inanna and An (van Dijk 1998); Inanna’s Descent to the Netherworld (Sladek 1974; Ferrara 2006); Inanna and Bilulu (Jacobsen and Kramer 1953). • Ninurta: Lugale or The Exploits of Ninurta (van Dijk 1983; Seminara 2001); Angim or Ninurta’s Journey to Nippur (Cooper 1978); Ninurta and the Turtle (Alster 1971–1972).32
There are a few isolated narratives focused on other deities, such as Nanna-Suen’s Journey to Nippur (Ferrara 1973), The Marriage of Martu (Kramer 1990), Nigishzida’s Journey to the Netherworld (Jacobsen and Alster 2000), and The Flood Story (Civil 1969; COS 1: 513–15). The latter is an early avatar of a tale that knew many incarnations in Mesopotamia and outside: the Babylonian Atrahasis, the Babylonian Gilgamesh, and Noah’s story in Genesis. Moreover, some of these mythic narratives constituted the core of later Akkadian narratives. The Descent of Ishtar is essentially a summarized Akkadian version of Inanna’s Descent.33 Lugale and Angim provided motifs and narrative elements for the Akkadian Story of Anzu and the Babylonian Story of Creation (also known as Enuuma eliš).
The basic outline of most Sumerian myths begins with a predicament in which the natural order of things is being disturbed or is yet to be established for the first time (Michałowski 1995a: 2285–86). The composition itself narrates the actions that lead to the (re)establishment of such an order. Enki and the World Order is an excellent example of a cosmogonic myth about the primordial establishment of order out of the original chaos, focusing on the creation of the universe and its allotment to individual deities. Moreover, some myths dwell both on the phenomenon of sudden chaos
50 Sumerian Literature



and the efforts to reestablish the lost order. For instance, in Inanna’s Descent to the Netherworld, Inanna goes from the heavens to the Netherworld, the realm of her sister, Ereshkigal. In order to reach the Netherworld, Inanna is asked to take off one item of clothing or jewelry at each of the seven gates through which she has to go. Once she arrives at the Netherworld, she has been rendered powerless without her clothes and jewels. Inanna feels weak and ill and she seems doomed to stay there as a corpse (lines 171–72):
munus tur5-ra uzu nig2-sig3-ga-še3 ba-an-ku4 uzu nig2-sig3-ga giškak-ta lu2 ba-da-an-la2 The ailing woman was turned into a corpse. The corpse was hung on a nail.

With Inanna being a goddess of war and sex, her absence causes infertility in the world. Thus, it becomes a necessity to get her out of the Netherworld, in order to reinstate the original order that was broken with her departure. The only way to accomplish this is to find another deity who can take her place in the Netherworld. Her lover, Dumuzi, is chosen to replace her. Dumuzi’s attempts to escape and subsequent recaptures are the object of several compositions aside from Inanna’s Descent, such as Dumuzi’s Dream (Alster 1972). Nonetheless, because of their contents and style, some compositions may seem to inhabit a gray area between mythic narrative and divine hymn, such as Enki’s Journey to Nippur, also known as Hymn to Enki’s Temple at Eridu, and a hymn to Ninurta (Ninurta B, with the subscript širgidda), which was originally published with the title Ninurta’s Journey to Eridu, even if the editor himself regarded it as a hymn (Reisman 1971). Furthermore, although humor is difficult to identify in a literature as removed from our culture as Sumerian literature is, there is a clear example of a learned narrative parodying a deity, Ninurta and the Turtle (Alster 2006).
Historical Literature
The group of Sumerian compositions that can be labeled as historical (or pseudo-historical) literature is quite miscellaneous in contents, and includes compositions as diverse as the Curse of Akkade, the Gudea cylinders, and the Sumerian King List. What all of them have in common is that they seem shaped and framed by specific theo-political and historiographic discourses. The two cylinders of Gudea (A and B) constitute together a narrative of hymnic tone, which deals with the rebuilding and dedication of the Eninnu temple complex in Lagash (Edzard 1997; Jacobsen 1987: 386–444; COS 2: 417–33). This is the longest literary text from the third millennium, as well as an astonishing and complex poetic achievement. The Gudea cylinders are in essence a sequence of narratives functioning as multilayered repertoires of items and events in a variety of contexts, from the procurement of raw materials for the construction of the Eninnu to the structure of the rituals involved and the rhetoric of kingship (Averbeck 1987; Suter 2000). The Curse of Akkade shares a number of features and motifs typical of the genre of city laments (Cooper 1983: 20–26). However, it is important to note that the Curse of Akkade ends with a zami doxology (like 281): a-gade3
ki hul-a dinanna za3-mi2 “Akkade is destroyed—praise for Inanna.” The zami doxology occurs in narrative compositions (both “epics” and myths), in wisdom literature, and in some hymns, but not in laments (Wilcke 1975: 258). Moreover, the Curse of Akkade does not include the rubrics that characterize city laments: kirugu and gišgigal. Furthermore, the Curse of Akkade is already attested in Ur III manuscripts and would seem to predate the
52 Sumerian Literature



genre of city laments and the laments and dirges associated with the galapriests (balags and eršemmas), both of which start to be attested in the Old Babylonian period. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence to postulate the existence of an earlier, pre-Old Babylonian tradition of lamentations, which is not preserved and with which the Curse of Akkade itself would have interacted (Cooper 2006). In an example of retro-feeding, the interaction was eventually mutual, as the Curse of Akkade provided the basic structural and thematic blueprint for the Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur (Michałowski 1989: 8–9). This is important because this Lamentation is probably the first of the city laments to be composed as we know them today (Vanstiphout 1986a: 7–8). The Tummal Chronicle is a short composition (thirty-two lines) that has been the object of much attention because it mentions Gilgamesh (Sollberger 1962; Oelsner 2003). Were the Tummal Chronicle to be a historical document, then Gilgamesh would be a truly historical king, rather than a legendary ruler. The composition is really a list of cult places and their builders: Enmebaragesi (or Enishibbaragesi; Michałowski 2003b), a legendary king of Kish of unlikely historicity, and his not-more-historical son, Agga; Mesannepada, Early Dynastic king of Ur of whom a couple of inscriptions are preserved; Gilgamesh, legendary king of Uruk; Nanne, which may be a hypocoristic of Mesannepada, and his son Meskiag-Nanna (Steinkeller 2003: 278); and the Ur III kings Ur-Namma and Shulgi. Each character builds a cultic place in Nippur, causes Tummal to shine, and brings Ninlil to Tummal. After each episode, Tummal is said to have been abandoned. This is not a historical document, but a scribal exercise in chartering royal legitimation through erudite enumeration. As mentioned above, its final lines attribute this composition to a Lu-Inanna, “chief leatherworker (ašgab gal) of Enlil,” who would have dictated the Tummal Chronicle to a scribe. The attribution of this composition to a leatherworker reinforces the ironic undercurrent of this scribal artifact (Michałowski 2006c). Although one may reasonably doubt its literariness, the Sumerian King List is much closer to the genre of the Tummal Chronicle and the literary enumerations than it may be supposed (Jacobsen 1939; Glassner 2004: 55–70, 117–26). The earliest manuscript of the Sumerian King List dates to the Ur III period (Steinkeller 2003). It was also attested outside southern Mesopotamia, at Shamshi-Adad’s capital during the Old Assyrian period, ShubatEnlil, modern Tell Leylaan (Vincente 1995). The Sumerian King List includes both legendary (and probably a-historical) kings along with perfectly historical ones for whom we have royal inscriptions and dated documents. In fact, the lengths of reigns for antediluvian rulers defy reason; for example, at Bad-tibira, Dumuzi the shepherd reigned 36,000 years; and at Shuruppak, Ubar-Tutu reigned 18,600 years. However, the Sumerian King List does get to historical kings such as Ur-Namma, Shulgi, and so forth. Although
Gonzalo Rubio 53



most historical kings are assigned reasonable regnal periods, Utu-hegal is said to have reigned “420 years and 7 days” at Uruk. Immediately after the antediluvian kings and before the historical ones, one finds names familiar from the Sumerian narratives: Enmerkar, Lugalbanda, and Gilgamesh. The famous section on Gilgamesh reads as follows (lines 110–13):
dgilgameš3 Gilgamesh,
ab-ba-ni lil2-la2 whose father was a nobody (or a ghost), en kul-la-ba-ke4 the lord of Kullaba, mu 126 i3-ak reigned 126 years.
Each section lists kings from a particular city during a specific period. Since Mesopotamia was never a political unit, one would have expected parallel dynasties. On the contrary, different formulas are used to denote the change from section to section, or rather from city to city and dynasty to dynasty.34 The Sumerian King List, along with the lists of year names and other king lists (e.g., the Assyrian king list), clearly belong in a scribal setting as both practical tools and ideological artifacts that articulated a historical discourse on kingship. It is surprising that the Sumerian King List does not mention Lagash. Thus, a sort of parody was composed to fill this gap, The Rulers of Lagash or The Royal Chronicle of Lagash (Sollberger 1967; Glassner 2004: 144–49). There are at least three different Sumerian compositions dealing with Sargon of Akkad and his rise to power (Cooper and Heimpel: 1983; Goodnick Westenholz 1997: 52–55). Furthermore, there is a literary text usually referred to as The Victory of Utu-hegal, which is preserved in Old Babylonian copies as a royal inscription of this king of Uruk (dating to the twenty-second century) and celebrates his victory over the Gutians (Frayne 1993: 283–93). We have several corpora of literary letters: the Royal Correspondence of Ur; the Royal Correspondence of Isin; and the Larsa Letter Prayers (Michałowski 1980–1983). Whereas the first two corpora (the correspondence of Ur and Isin) consist of literary letters written in prose, the third group includes only letter prayers, which exhibit the devices and tropes characteristic of poetic texts. The Royal Correspondence of Ur is the larger corpus of its kind, with about twenty letters, all of which purpose to have a king of the Ur III dynasty as either their sender or their addressee, with the exception of Ur-Namma, for whom no letter is known (Ali 1964: 27–62; Michałowski 1976). Perhaps the Royal Correspondence of Ur corpus may have been written during the Old Babylonian period, even if these literary letters were devised to pass for actual Ur III letters (Huber 2001; but see Hallo 2006). Regardless of their actual compositional date, it is clear that neither the Royal Correspondence of Ur nor Royal Correspondence of Isin contains actual historical documents, but rather literary (re)elaborations of historical and political motifs. The Royal Correspondence of Isin consists of four
54 Sumerian Literature



letters pertaining to Iddin-Dagan and Lipit-Eshtar and two fragmentary ones that may include the names of other kings of Isin (Ali 1964: 63–79; Michałowski 1980–1983: 55–56). The Larsa Letter Prayers are substantially different in content and style and are dealt with below (section on “Songs, Laments, and Prayers”). The compositions included in the Royal Correspondence of Ur and the Royal Correspondence of Isin are not the only literary letters in the Sumerian traditions. A few literary letters that do not involve specific kings, but rather officials, unnamed rulers, and private individuals, have been preserved as well (Ali 1964).
Hymns to Gods, Kings, and Temples
There is a large corpus of hymns devoted to specific deities (Falkenstein 1959; van Dijk 1960). Some deities were the object of several hymns (e.g., Inanna and Ninurta), whereas for others we have single examples, regardless of how important that deity was in the Mesopotamian pantheon (e.g., Enlil): Asarluhi, Baba, Damgalnunna, Enki, Enlil, Hendursagga, Inanna, Ishkur, Lisin, Lulal, Martu, Nanna, Nanshe, Nergal, Nidaba, Ningirsu, Ninazu, Nigishzida, Ningublaga, Ninimma, Ninisina, Ninkasi, Ninlil, Ninshubur, Nintu, Ninurta, Nungal, Nuska, Shara, Shulpae, and Utu. Some hymns deserve special mention. The hymn to Enlil (Enlilsuraše, den-lil2 su3-ra2-še3 dug4-ga-ni mah “Enlil—from afar are his commands lofty”) offers an example of the theo-political discourse articulated with this genre: By choosing Nippur as his abode, Enlil bestows a sacred status upon this city and its king, who is described as an official in Enlil’s temple, the Ekur (Falkenstein 1959: 5–79; Jacobsen 1987: 101–11; Römer 2001: 143–48). Moreover, the Nanshe hymn charters the relations between this goddess, the city of her choice (Nina, part of the Lagash state), various gods, and the installation of Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, as the high priest of her temple at Sirara, in Nina (Heimpel 1981; Jacobsen 1987: 125–42; COS 1: 526–31). The Nungal hymn seems to have been quite popular among scribes, since it remains preserved in many manuscripts and belongs to the Decad (Sjöberg 1973a; Attinger 2003).35 Furthermore, as one would expect, a few hymns are devoted to Nidaba, since she is the patroness of both the scribal craft and agriculture (Hallo 1970; Michałowski 1998–2001; COS 1: 531–32). To illustrate the diversity of subgenres within divine hymns, one should note that Nanshe was also the object of a balbale and an emesal song, of which only the first kirugu is preserved (Römer 2001: 173–95; Alster 2005b). As in the case of many other Sumerian compositions, their present state of preservation poses difficulties. For instance, the hymn devoted to the god Hendursagga (or Hendursanga, Akkadian Išum) has been incompletely preserved and exhibits several substantial gaps, so about a fourth of the composition is missing (Attinger and Krebernik 2004).

Some compositions tend to be grouped with the divine hymns, even if their contents, structure, and discernable function clearly depart from those of most hymns. For instance, the composition known as Nanshe and the Birds is sometimes catalogued as a hymn to Nanshe. However, this very learned composition was created in a textual dialogue established with Early Dynastic and Old Babylonian lexical lists of bird names (Veldhuis 2004). Others are set aside mostly because of their length, or because of the wealth of their textual tradition. This is the case of The Exaltation of Inanna or Ninmešarra (nin me šar2-ra “lady of all the me’s/divine powers”), which is sometimes known as Inanna hymn B (Zgoll 1997; COS 1: 518–22). Likewise, Inanna hymn C is most commonly known by its incipit, Inninšagurra (in-nin ša3-gur4-ra “lady with a great heart”; Sjöberg 1975a). In some compositions, a deity is addressed with two names, such as the hymn in which Inanna is invoked under the name Ninegalla (nin-e2-gal-la “lady of the palace”) as well (Behrens 1998). A typical stylistic feature of Mesopotamian hymns, both in Sumerian and Akkadian, is the parallelistic repetition in which the names of deities and their epithets alternate, going always from the general (epithet, pronominal construction) to the specific (personal name). This is an example from the hymn to Ninkasi, the goddess of beer (Civil 1964a, lines 45–48):
kaš si-im duglahtan-na de2-a-zu
id
2idigna id
2buranun-na sag si3-ga-am3 dnin-ka-si kaš si-im duglahtan-na de2-a-zu
id
2idigna id
2buranun-na sag si3-ga-am3
You are the one who pours out the filtered beer of the collector vat. It is like the onrush of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Ninkasi, you are the one who pours out the filtered beer of the collector vat. It is like the onrush of the Tigris and the Euphrates.
Royal hymns were composed for the glorification and praise of kings from various periods: the Early Dynastic; Ur III; Old Babylonian dynasties (Isin, Larsa, and the First Dynasty of Babylon). These hymns stress the relations—and sometimes relationships—between rulers and deities, as well as the theo-political discourse of kingship as articulated by the palace and the political and cultural elites. The corpus of Shulgi hymns is by far the largest and most important (Klein 1981a, 1981b; COS 1: 552–53). In fact, Shulgi hymn A was one of the most widely copied Sumerian compositions, with at least one Ur III manuscript (Rubio 2000: 216).36 The beginning of Shulgi A is a good example of the rhetoric characterizing the royal hymns (lines 1–10):
lugal-me-en ša3-ta ur-sag-me-en dšul-gi-me-en ba-tu-ud-de3-en-na-ta nita kalag-ga-me-en

I, the king, from the womb I am a hero. I, Šulgi, from my birth I am a mighty man. I am a fierce-looking lion, begotten by a dragon. I am the king of the four regions (sc. of the known world). I am the herdsman and shepherd of the black-headed ones (= humankind). I am the noble one, the god of all the lands. I am a child born of Ninsun. I am the choice of holy An’s heart. I am he whose fate was decided by Enlil. I am Shulgi, the beloved of Ninlil.
Shulgi’s predecessor, Ur-Namma, also has a respectable corpus of hymns (Flückiger-Hawker 1999). Since Ur-Namma was one of the few Mesopotamian kings killed in battle, a long hymn was composed on that occasion, which is known as the Death of Ur-Namma, or Ur-Namma hymn A (Flückiger-Hawker 1999: 93–182). Among the kings of the Isin dynasty, the number of hymns to Ishme-Dagan is surpassed only by those devoted to Shulgi (Römer 1965; Ludwig 1990). In the case of the Larsa dynasty, Rim-Sin was the object of the largest corpus (Brisch 2007). In northern Babylonia, a small group of royal hymns were devoted to a few Amorite kings of the First Dynasty of Babylon (Hammurabi, Samsu-iluna, and Abi-eshuh). The Collection of Temple Hymns consists of short hymns to temples and shrines in Sumer and Akkad (Sjöberg and Bergmann 1969). The Kesh Temple Hymn is attested already in Early Dynastic tablets from AAbbuu S+alabīh, and in Old Babylonian edubbas it became part of the Decad (Gragg in Sjöberg and Bergmann 1969; Biggs 1971; Jacobsen 1987: 377–85; Wilcke 2006). The Hymn to the Ekur sings the praises of the Enlil temple at Nippur (Kramer 1957).
Paradigmatic Compositions
The label “paradigmatic compositions” refers to literary texts that lack traditional characters, that is, gods, heroes, or rulers (Veldhuis 2004: 68–69). This genre includes several categories: disputations, the edubba corpus, and dialogues and diatribes (Vanstiphout 2003b). The disputations or debate poems are verbal contests between various objects and animals (Vanstiphout 1990–1992, 1991): The Hoe and the Plow (Civil 1965; COS 1: 578
Gonzalo Rubio 57



81); The Tree and the Reed; The Bird and the Fish (COS 1: 581–84); Ewe and Grain or Lahar and Ashnan (Alster and Vanstiphout 1987; COS 1: 575–78); Summer and Winter (van Dijk 1953: 42–57; COS 1: 584–88); Silver and Copper (van Dijk 1953: 58–64); Tamarisk and Date Palm. The Sumerian disputations share the same basic structure: a narrative preamble of historical or mythological nature; the introduction of the characters and the subject of the debate; the disputation itself, normally divided into sections; and a conclusion in which a deity designates the winner (van Dijk 1953: 39–42). The term that means debate or disputation, adamin or adamin dugga (ada-min3, a-da-min3 dug4-ga) is not limited to these specific compositions, but is widely attested in texts of several genres and in all sorts of contexts (van Dijk 1953: 31–34). It is possible to think that some additional debates should be included in this group, even if their protagonists are human and their structure does not match that of the aforementioned disputations. For instance, The Shepherd and the Farmer is frequently placed in the Inanna-Dumuzi corpus, because it consists of a contest between Dumuzi and Enkimdu over Inanna’s love (Sefati 1998: 324–43). However, its end includes a reference to the generic label adamin dugga (van Dijk 1953: 65–85; Vanstiphout 1990–1992: 275). Moreover, in spite of their nonhuman protagonists, a composition such as The Heron and the Turtle would not fully fit in the genre of disputations such as The Bird and the Fish. While disputations contain the text of a debate, The Heron and the Turtle is the story of a quarrel (Gragg 1973). Regardless of their individual subject matters, most of these compositions appear to be learned artifacts of scribal manufacture. The edubba corpus encompasses several satirical descriptions and dialogues, normally focused on teachers and students and set in the school (Volk 1996, 2000): Schooldays or Edubba A (Kramer 1949); Father and Son or Edubba B (Sjöberg 1973c); Advice to the Young Scribe or Edubba C (COS 1: 590–92); Scribal Activities or Edubba D (Civil 1985; COS 1: 592–93); Examen texts A & B or Edubba I & II (Sjöberg 1975b); and Praise of the Edubba or Edubba III (Sjöberg 1972b). Dialogues and diatribes are some of the most challenging Sumerian compositions and the majority of these texts remain unedited: dialogues between Two Scribes (or Dialogue 1), Enki-hegal and Enki-talu (or Dialogue 2), Enki-mansum and Girniisag (or Dialogue 3; Römer 1988; COS 1: 589–90); Two Women (A & B; Dialogues 4 & 5); Scribes (Dialogues 6 & 7); and a small group of diatribes, one of them against a certain Engardug (Diatribe B; Sjöberg 1972a) and another one against a fellow named Usani (Diatribe A).37 Other paradigmatic compositions do not fall under these basic categories, but still belong under this generic umbrella. They do not have any traditional characters and share some features with other kinds of paradigmatic compositions: The Heron and the Turtle (Gragg 1973; COS 1: 571–73); The Home of the Fish (Civil 1961); The Song of the Hoe (Farber-Flügge 1999;
58 Sumerian Literature



Edzard 2000; COS 1: 511–13); The Song of the Millstone (Civil 2006). For instance, the Song of the Hoe is composed around the sign AL (gišal “hoe”), which is used in all possible ways, as well as assonances and rhymes with signs and words containing the sequence /al/ (e.g., gal “big,” gal2 “to exist”). Furthermore, there are a couple of brief compositions of difficult classification, but which are somehow linked to some of the characteristics of paradigmatic compositions, even if their paradigmatic protagonists (an axe and a dog) are connected to traditional characters: The Axe of Nergal (Behrens 1988) and The Dog of Nintinugga (Ali 1964: 144–48)
Proverbs, Instructions, and Wisdom Literature
Although most Sumerian proverbs are typically short paremiological sentences, they were copied and transmitted in collections arranged according to topics (Alster 1997; COS 1: 563–67). At least twenty-eight collections of proverbs—also known as rhetorical collections—have been identified. As in many other cultural traditions, proverbs and proverb collections played an essential role in the education of Mesopotamian scribes (Alster and Oshima 2006: 31–43). Moreover, some proverbs went beyond the one-liner and developed into brief stories that frequently resemble Aesop’s fables. The earliest proverbs date to the Early Dynastic period (Alster 1991–1992). The Instructions of Shuruppak are attested in copies from the Early Dynastic (Abu S+alabīh and Adab), as well as in Hurrian and Akkadian translations (Alster 2005a: 31–220; COS 1: 569–70). The Instructions of Ur-Ninurta consist in general advice on a wide variety of matters (Alster 2005a: 221–40; COS 1: 570–71). Another composition known as the Counsels of Wisdom was copied along with the Instructions of Ur-Ninurta on some Sammeltafeln (Alster 2005a: 241–64). A more specialized kind of instruction, beyond the strictly sapiential genre, is exemplified by the Farmer’s Instructions, also known as the Georgica, which focus on technical agricultural matters (Civil 1994). Moreover, there is a composition that does not dwell on actual advising as much as it complains about human flaws, especially vanity—the topos of vanitas vanitatum, as in Ecclesiastes (Qohelet): Nothing Is Precious or Nignam nukal, which is preserved in several different versions. It begins with a line that is identical to one in the Instructions of Shuruppak (Alster 2005a: 266–87): “nothing is precious, but life should be sweet” (nig2-nam nu-kal zi ku7-ku7-dam). Similarly concerned with the vanity topos, a composition known as Enlil and Namzitarra—the latter being a low-ranking official in the former’s temple—is preserved in fragments and tablets from Old Babylonian Nippur and from Late-Bronze Ugarit (Alster 2005a: 327–38). Furthermore, there is a composition known as A Man and His God, which is normally classified as wisdom literature, but which was given the subscript eršaneša (er2-ša3-ne-ša4 “wail of supplication”) by Mesopotamian scribes,
Gonzalo Rubio 59



mostly because it contains a penitential hymn based on cultic laments (van Dijk 1953: 122–27; Kramer 1955; Klein 2006; COS 1: 573–75). The literary exercise of recovering and repossessing the memory of a common history, which explains the Sumerian King List and other historical literature, is exemplified in a sapiential composition known among modern scholars as “The poem of early rulers” or “La ballade des héros (or rois) du temps jadis.” Sections of this composition are preserved in Sumerian copies from Old Babylonian Nippur and Sippar, in Middle-Babylonian bilingual copies from Emar and Ugarit, and in one Neo-Assyrian bilingual as well (Alster 2005a: 288–322). The poem reminds us of the Medieval motif ubi sunt? (“where are they now?”), which reached its climax among fifteenthcentury European poets, François Villon in France and Jorge Manrique in Spain. This section is representative of the melancholy tone of the poem (lines 9–19):

Like the remote heavens, can my hand reach them? Like the deep underworld, no one knows them. All life is a mirage. Who is it that can make a life without glamour superior to death?
There are some Sumerian wisdom compositions that can be categorized as fables in the Greco-Roman sense since their protagonists are animals: The Goose and the Raven (kur-gi4
mušem and ugamušen) and a few fables featuring foxes and other animals (Alster 2005a: 342–67). There are a few stories, some of which may have originated in folktales but whose preserved texts

have hints of scribal humor: The Fowler and His Wife (Alster 1992: 186–95; 2005a: 371–72); The Slave and the Scoundrel (Alster 1992: 195–201); The Lazy Slave Girl (Alster 2005a: 370–71); The Adulterer (Alster 2005a: 368–69); The Old Man and the Young Girl (Alster 2005a: 384–90); and The Three Ox-Drivers from Adab (Alster 2005a: 373–83). Moreover, riddles are represented in the Sumerian literary corpus. From Early Dynastic Lagash, there is a collection of riddles, which combine names of canals, deities and their epithets, fish, and snakes, although some classify the collection as a literary enumeration in generic terms (Biggs 1973; Marchesi 1999: 3). In the Old Babylonian period, twenty-five riddles are known (Civil 1987b). Whereas the Early Dynastic riddles did not include the answer, the Old Babylonian ones do, marked with the formula ki-bur2-bi “its answer” (Civil 1987b: 28):
šušinki-še3 i3-du-de3-en-ma I had to go to Susa, egir-mu-še3 i-im-gur-re-en and then come back. [ki]-"bur2#-bi gišnim-bar-a[m3] Answer: The date palm.
This riddle is based on phonetic and graphic clues: “palm tree” is nimbar; bar alone means “back”; nim alone means “high, upper” and is the same sign used to write the toponym Elam (NIM = elam “the upper country”); and Susa was a political capital of Elam.38
The Inanna-Dumuzi Corpus: Myth and Ritual?
A loosely defined corpus of compositions featuring Dumuzi and Inannasome of which are labeled as royal hymns, whereas others are called Inanna-Dumuzi love lyrics—is frequently associated with the so-called sacred marriage or hierogamic ritual (Sefati 1998; Rubio 2001; Lapinkivi 2004; COS 1: 540–43). Within the celebration of the New Year festival, two human proxies (probably the king and a high priestess) would have enacted or reenacted the divine union between Inanna and Dumuzi. The evidence for such a ritual is ambiguous and scarce. For instance, some Ur III texts from Lagash mention pristesses spending the night in the bedchamber of a god. Moreover, third-millennium literary compositons refer to marriage ceremonies between deities, as in the case of Ningirsu and Baba in the cylinders and several statues of Gudea. Echoes of such ceremonies survive in first-millennium Akkadian compositions describing the epithalamia of Nabû and Tašmeetu in Assyria, and Nabû and Nanaya in Babylonia. In fact, there is evidence for the celebration of some sort of sacred marriage rites (pars+ī ša hhašadu) during the New Year akītu Festival in a period as late as the Hellenistic one, in Seleucid Babylon (Linssen 2004: 70–71). However, most of the details of this sacred marriage are unknown to us. Nonetheless, other possible sacred marriage rites have been
Gonzalo Rubio 61



proposed for earlier periods, especially involving the Moon-god, NannaSuen, and his high priestess at Ur (Charpin 1986: 198–99; Goodnick Westenholz 1989: 547–48). It is not certain that such a ritual was regularly performed throughout Mesopotamian history, or that the behavior of the human proxies supposedly involved in the rites actually mirrored, in any way or fashion, the actions attributed to the deities as part of their divine nuptials. Nevertheless, what is incontrovertible is that there was a literary and ideological construct one can call sacred marriage and that this played an important theo-political role in the discourse on royal authority and legitimation in Ancient Mesopotamia. This function can easily be discerned in royal hymns with sacred marriage components, such as Ur-Namma D (Tinney 1999b) and Iddin-Dagan A (Jacobsen 1987: 112–24; Jones 2003; COS 1: 554–59).
Laments, Songs, and Prayers
There are at least five city laments: the Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur (Michałowski 1989; COS 1: 535–39); the Ur Lament (Römer 2004; Jacobsen 1987: 447–74); the Eridu Lament (Green 1978); the Uruk Lament (Green 1984); and finally the Nippur Lament (Tinney 1996). Of these five laments, only three are fully preserved: the Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur, the Ur Lament, and the Nippur Lament. These laments are characterized by the performative rubrics kirugu and gišgigal. As seen above, the Curse of Akkade shares a number of features and motifs typical of the genre of city laments. However, the Curse of Akkade does not really belong to the lament genre. For instance, the Curse of Akkade ends with a zami doxology, which does not occur in laments (Wilcke 1975: 258). Moreover, the Curse of Akkade is attested in several Ur III manuscripts, whereas no manuscript of any city lament can be dated prior to the Old Babylonian period. Nonetheless, there is evidence to support the existence of an earlier tradition of lamentations, with which the Curse of Akkade interacted (Cooper 2006). This interaction eventually became a two-way street and the Curse of Akkade exerted strong influence on several aspects of the Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur (Michałowski 1989: 8–9). Thus, a genealogy of sorts has been postulated: the Curse of Akkade led to the fashioning of the Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur in the Old Babylonian period; the Ur Lament followed the Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur; the Ur Lament triggered the composition of the Eridu Lament and the Uruk Lament; and finally the Nippur Lament was shaped as the culmination of this tradition (Vanstiphout 1986a: 7–9). Some city laments (those over Ur, Eridu, and Nippur) exhibit sections with emesal dialectal features, especially in passages uttered by goddesses. In the Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur, there is some isolated

emesal coloring, mostly limited to a formulaic sequence attested in a balag composition as well (Michałowski 1989: 52, 94; Schretter 1990: 95). The prototypical emesal compositions, the songs and dirges associated with the gala-priests, start to be attested in the Old Babylonian period (especially eršemmas and balags) and represent the other side of the lament macrogenre. In spite of the inclusion of rubrics (kirugu and gišgigal) and their possible public performance, the city laments seem to have been fashioned as scribal compositions in learned dialogue with others, such as the Curse of Akkade and a likely pre-Old Babylonian balag tradition. On the other hand, the mere association with the gala-priests points to the strongly performance-oriented nature of the different laments and dirges that eventually constituted a canonical liturgical corpus in later periods (balags, eršemmas). In this respect, several kinds of laments are usually classified as emesal compositions: balags, eršahungas, eršemmas, širnamšubs, and šuilas (Schretter 1990: 89–96; Black 1991). This refers to the presence of lexical items and morphological elements identifiable as belonging to the emesal dialect. However, as was seen above, no composition is written entirely in emesal. What may be more important is that these emesal compositions are the domain of the gala-priests. Moreover, there are other kinds of hymnic compositions in which one can find isolated instances of emesal mostly in the speech of goddesses such as Inanna and Baba (Ningirsu’s wife), as is the case of a couple of adabs and tigis (Schretter 1990: 87). Furthermore, emesal is particularly common in balbale compositions. Whereas in other hymns (such as balags and eršemmas) the use of emesal seems to be linked to the performer (the gala-priest), in balbales its occurrence is determined by the genre (the Inanna-Dumuzi corpus) and the presence of Inanna herself. Compositions identified in catalogues as cultic laments are not necessarily devoid of narrative sections. For instance, a composition known by its incipit, In the Desert, in the Early Grass (eden-a u2-sag-ga), is listed as a balag song, i.e., a cultic lament (Alster 1986; Jacobsen 1987: 56–84; Fritz 2003: 178–83). In it, Dumuzi has been identified with the god Damu and a series of narrative sections and dialogues are combined with hymnic laments and even a long litany of local names of the dying god (Dumuzi, Damu) and their place of burial. The adab songs are normally hymns to gods and hymnic prayers on behalf of rulers; their name corresponds to a kind of drum (a-da-ab) that probably accompanied the chanting or singing of these compositions.39 An interesting adab hymn is devoted to the goddess Baba, Ningirsu’s wife (Römer 2001: 19–33; Marchesi 2006: 132–39). The numerous balag songs were liturgical laments, attested from the Old Babylonian period down to the Seleucid period.40 The term balag (balag) probably refers to two different musical instruments: a kind of harp and a drum. Balags exhibit abundant emesal forms and focus on generic themes:

the destruction and abandonment of temples and deities; the enemy that brought humiliation; lament and melancholic nostalgia. Since in the first millennium the singing or chanting of balags was followed by the recitation of eršemmas, it is not always easy to reconstruct the exact text of the balags. They consist of textual blocks that are repeated within the same balag and in other balags, as well as in eršemmas (Kutscher 1975: 18; Civil 1983a: 45). There are several Old Babylonian catalogues listing over thirty compositions, which are most commonly identified as either balag dinanna “balags of Inanna” or balag dingir-re-e-ne “balags of the gods” (Krecher 1966: 33; Kramer 1982; Cohen 1988: 17). From the library of Assurbanipal at Nineveh, we have a Neo-Assyrian catalogue listing fifty-seven incipits for balags, eighty for eršemmas, and forty for šuilas (Cohen 1988: 15–16). In this later catalogue, balags are divided into “balags of Enlil” and “balags of Inanna,” and are further identified by the deity to whom they were addressed (Enki, Enlil, Gula, Assur, Marduk, Nabu, Nergal, and so on). Balags, as well as eršemmas, were eventually compiled and arranged into long liturgical compositions (“canonical lamentations”). A particularly interesting balag liturgical composition, attested already in the Old Babylonian period, is known by its Sumerian first line: uru2 am3-ma-ir-ra-bi “this city, which has been looted” (Volk 1989: 11–13). The canonical version of this series—including an interlinear Akkadian translation, typical of the first millennium—consisted of twenty-one tablets, of which only the first and last three are almost completely preserved, leaving considerable gaps in the middle (Civil 1983a; Cohen 1988: 536–603; Volk 1989). The balbale (bal-bal-e) compositions are more difficult to define. Half of all the balbale songs belong to the so-called Inanna-Dumuzi corpus, loosely constructed.41 Since bal can be an elliptical form of a compound verb meaning, among other things, “to converse, to exchange words” (inimbal; PSD B: 54–55), it has been suggested that balbale songs were duets of sorts or musical dialogues (Landsberger 1949: 295 n. 161). In fact, at the end of one balbale, there is a reference to the label usually reserved for the genre of dialogues and disputations, adamin dugga (a-da-min3 dug4-ga). As mentioned above, the end of Dumuzi and Enkimdu (or The Shepherd and the Farmer) reads as follows (lines 88–90; Sefati 1998: 325–43):
sipa engar-da a-da-min3 dug4-ga ki-sikil dinanna za3-mi2 dug3-ga-am3 bal-bal-e-dam
The shepherd was having a dispute with the farmer. Maiden Inanna, this zami/praise is sweet. It is a balbale.
However, only about one-fifth of some thirty compositions labeled as balbale can be construed as dialogues (Sefati 1998: 24). Thus, they may have
64 Sumerian Literature



been multimodal songs, as one of the meanings of bal is “to turn, rotate, change” (Kilmer 1993–1997: 470). A bit like šir, the noun endu (en3-du, en8-du) is probably a general term for song or hymn as well, although endu is particularly common in reference to royal hymns.42 The term eršaneša (er2-ša3-ne-ša4 “wail of supplication”) is referred to in a passage of the Ur Lament (line 343): er2-ša4-ne-ša4 nu-tuku-am3 kur-kur im-ma-an-tuš “with no eršanešas, it (sc. your land) dwells in foreign lands” (Römer 2004: 73, 155). The term can be found, in parallel with a reference to eršahungas, in an Old Babylonian balag (Kramer 1981: 3, 6–7). The label eršaneša surprisingly appears as the subscript of a composition known as A Man and His God, which is normally classified as wisdom literature, but which contains a penitential hymn or dirge based on cultic laments (van Dijk 1953: 122–27; Kramer 1955; Klein 2006; COS 1: 573–75). The eršemma laments (er2-šem3-ma “wail or dirge of the šem-drum”) were quite numerous, with about two hundred compositions listed in four Old Babylonian and two first-millennium catalogues.43 Eršemmas are addressed to deities and contain a variety of motifs and sections: mythological references and brief narratives, lamentations, and encomiastic hymns. The opening lines consist normally of a list of cities, buildings, or epithets. In the first millennium, eršemmas were usually recited by the gala-priests immediately after the chanting or singing of a balag. Moreover, as opposed to other widespread songs, dirges, and prayers, both balags and eršemmas were eventually organized in long liturgical compositions. The eršahunga prayers or laments are literally “wails or dirges to soothe the heart (of an irate god)” (er2-ša3-hun-ga2). They are attested already in the Old Babylonian period, but most eršahungas are bilingual texts (in Sumerian and Akkadian) from Assurbanipal’s library at Nineveh (Michałowski 1987; Maul 1988). A gigid (gi-gid2) was a kind of song named after a flute. In spite of its name (gi “reed”), a gigid could be made of metal: bronze, silver, or gold (Krecher 1966: 190; Kilmer 1993–1997: 464–65). The subscript kungar (kun-gar) was used for two compositions of the Inanna-Dumuzi corpus, but the term remains difficult to interpret (Wilcke 1975: 261; Sefati 1998: 26). As with many other songs, a malgatum (ma-al-ga-tum) took its name most likely from a musical instrument (cf. CAD M/A: 162). A number of songs and laments have names beginning with the word šir (šir3 “song”). Even an important lexical list devoted a small section to a number of šir terms, Proto-Lu.44 In Akkadian, šir3 was usually translated as zamaru (“song”). Moreover, Sumerian šir3 was most likely borrowed into Akkadian as šeru (“song”)—šir3 can also be read šer3 and sir3. As will be seen in several examples below, šir was used sometimes to refer to compositions that are more narrative than hymnic. It is not a coincidence that out

side Mesopotamia, among the Hittite scribes of Hattusa, the Sumerogram SIR3/ŠIR3 was employed as a generic label in the subscripts and colophons of narrative compositions such as the Story of the Hunter Kessi and the Hurro-Hittite bilingual composition known now as the Epic of Emancipation (Neu 1996: 7–8).45 The subscript širgidda (šir3-gid2-da “long song”) is attached to a few hymns devoted to deities such as Ninurta, Nuska, and Martu, as well as sporadically to other compositions that do not fall under the same category, especially Angim or Journey of Ninurta to Nippur (see above).46 The label širhamunna (šir3-ha-mun-na “song of harmony”) occurs both in lexical and literary texts to refer to a specific kind of composition (Flückiger-Hawker 1999: 261). The term širkad or širka, spelled either šir3-kad4 or šir-ka5 (ka5 = NAR), occurs a few times and is equated to Akkadian balag zamaari—zamaaru meaning both “song” and “to sing”—and rikis zamaari, the latter meaning perhaps “song-cycle” (Volk 1989: 110).47 The term is attested in a hymn of Ishme-Dagan, king of Isin (Ludwig 1990: 193–95), and a hymn of Shulgi, the Ur III king. In the case of Shulgi hymn B, the context may help us understand its meaning (line 363):
dumu-sag inim u3-tud šir3 kad4 inim kad4-bi-im
The firstborn son is a fashioner of words, a composer of songs, a composer of words.
The verb kad4 means basically “to tie together,” but it can probably be defined as “to weave (a mat)” as well. In this respect, širkad is not really a specialized term for a song genre, but rather a construction predicated in the cross-cultural metaphor of weaving and joining words together into poems and songs. For instance, these metaphors are commonplace in Indo-European poetics and lexicon: Greek rhapsooidós (“rhapsode”) comes from rháptein (“to sew together”) and aoidé (“song”); Greek téktoon (“joiner, carpenter”) and tékhne, (“craft, art”) are cognates of Latin texere (“to join, weave, compose”).48 It has been suggested that a similar weaving metaphor lies behind the Sumerian compound verb šir3—ra (Akkadian s+arahu), usually translated as “to sing” (Kilmer 2006: 211–12). However, the verbal part of this compound (ra) really means “to strike,” even if its Akkadian equivalent (mahas+u “to strike”) may also mean, by semantic extension, “to weave” and “to play a musical instrument” (CAD M/1: 72, 78). If anything, this ra may refer to the action of “striking up a song”—mirroring so the English phrasal verb—as is indicated by the sequences of verbs in which šir3—ra occurs (Attinger 1993: 693). The term širkalkal (šir3-kal-kal “prized song”) appears in the subscript of Dumuzi’s Dream (Alster 1972: 122). In spite of its apparently imprecise meaning, the term širku (šir3-ku3 “pure/sacred song; incantation”) seems
66 Sumerian Literature



to be used in a technical sense, as in the sequence širku namšub (šir3-ku3 nam-šub), meaning literally “sacred song(šir3)-incantation(nam-šub),” although the compositions in question were essentially hymns (similar or identical to the širnamšub) and not incantations (Cohen 1975; FlückigerHawker 1999: 261). The term širmah (šir3-mah “lofty song”) may refer to a specific type of song, but the implications of this very rare label remain unclear (Krecher 1966: 162–63). The subscript širnamerimma (šir3-namerim2-ma lit. “song of an oath”) occurs in a song for Shulgi, also known as Shulgi hymn S (Cohen 1975: 592; Schretter 1990: 89–90). The label širnamgala (šir3-nam-gala) literally means “song of the gala-priesthood” and it is employed to designate at least three different compositions: IbbiSin hymn B (Sjöberg 1970–1971): Lipit-Eshtar hymn E (Tinney 1996: 52); and a hymn to Nanna, Nanna L (Sjöberg 1973b: 31–36, 52–53; Wilcke 1975: 288; Schretter 1990: 91). The nature of the širnamšub (šir3-nam-šub lit. “incantation-song”) is more complicated, as its name would seem to indicate an incantation. However, the širnamšub, as well as the širku namšub, were hymnic compositions.49 The label širnamursagga (šir3-nam-ur-sag-ga2 “song of warriorship/heroism”) is attested as the subscript of Iddin-Dagan hymn A (Reisman 1970: 147–211; 1973; Jacobsen 1987: 112–24; COS 1: 554–59). The term širsag (šir3-sag “front/main song”) was probably both a general term for “lament, dirge” (as in lu2 šir3-sag “singer of laments”) and a specific kind of subscript (Krecher 1966: 161–62). The subscript širšahula (šir3-ša3hul2-la “song that makes the heart rejoice”) is attested in a poorly preserved hymn to the goddess Damgalnunna, Enki’s wife (Green 1975: 86–89). The song itself, širšahula, is mentioned in Iddin-Dagan hymn A (Reisman 1970: 163, line 207). The label širsud or širsuda (šir3-sud or šir3-su3-da, meaning perhaps “lasting song”) probably occurs in the broken subscript of Lugale attested in a tablet fragment from Old Babylonian Nippur (text Z2 in van
Dijk 1983: II 181): [šir3]-"sud?# dnin-urta-ka “širsud of Ninurta,” but this
could be read also [za3]-"mi2
?# dnin-urta-ka “praise/zami of Ninurta.” Other šir-terms are attested, sometimes even outside compositions and subscripts, including the lexical list Proto-Lu (see above): širda (šir3-da; Taylor 2001: 221); širhalamma (šir3-ha-lam-ma “song of destruction” or “song of oblivion”; Taylor 2001: 221); širamagan (šir3-ama-gan “song of the child-bearing mother”); širbanda (šir3-ban3-da “small song”); širmagure (šir3-ma2-gur8-re “song for barges”); širnamnar (šir3-nam-nar “song of the musician’s craft”); širnamsipa (šir3-nam-sipa “song of the shepherd’s craft”); and širRIgu or širdegu (šir3-RI-gu4 or šir3-de5-gu4 “song to gather cattle”). The term šuila (šu-il2-la “the raising of the hand,” in a praying posture) occurs for the first time in hymns and inscriptions from the late Larsa dynasty (Rim-Sin, Warad-Sin) in the Old Babylonian period.50 A possible attestation of the word in an Early Dynastic inscription of Urukagina re

mains uncertain (Cooper 1988: 84 n. 7). Although catalogues contain about fifty incipits of šuilas, only a handful of these individual prayers have been preserved. All the šuila prayers are emesal compositions and should be distinguished from other texts written fully in main-dialect Sumerian which nevertheless received the subscript šuila. The latter were used in the ritual known in Akkadian as mīs pî (“washing of the mouth”), which dealt with the making and consecration of divine statues. These main-dialect šuilas had no relation to the gala-priests but belonged rather to the domain of the “magic practitioner” or “exorcist,” the ašipu (Cooper 1988: 84). The šumunša (šumun-ša4) is mentioned in several royal hymns: Shulgi hymns B (173), C (88), and E (30, 55), and an Ishme-Dagan hymn (hymn A + V = Enlildiriše 340, den-lil2 diri-še3 “Enlil, by far,” see below).51 The element ša4 occurs as the verbal part of several compound verbs referring to making various kinds of noises, and šumun here may perhaps mean “old wood.” The tigi songs received their name from a musical instrument, a kind of drum probably made of copper (tigi, urudutigi). Tigi-drums were particularly common in wailing and lamentation situations, but the subscript tigi pertains to various kinds of hymns (Wilcke 1975: 290–92; Krispijn 1990: 3; Römer 2001: 17). Most tigi songs contain several sections with different subscripts: sagidda, sagarra, gišgigal, barsu, and šabatuk.
The ululumama (u3-lu-lu-ma-ma, u2-lu-lu-ma-ma) probably takes its name from onomatopoeias mimicking the cries of joy (cp. English ululate, ululation, from Latin ululare “to howl”), such as those reflected in Akkadian ele,_lu/alaa,lu and ellumallu (Wilcke 1975: 289; Civil 1976: 84, 90; Kilmer 1993–1997: 470). It occurs as the subscript of a hymn to the Moon-god Nanna (Nanna J), the Song of the Plowing Oxen (Civil 1976), and a royal hymn of Ibbi-Sin devoted to the Moon-god Sin. Likewise, ulilla (u3-lil2-la2) is an onomatopoeic word attested as the subscript of Inanna and Bilulu (Civil 1976: 90). Both ululumama and ulilla belong to a generic group of songs with onomatopoeic names: i-lu, e-el-lu, e-la-lu, etc. Most of these compositions are working songs, including women’s working songs with emesal features (Civil 2006: 121–22). As with other subscripts and generic labels, zamzam (za-am-za-am) can indicate both a musical instrument and a hymnic composition. Rather than as a subscript, the term zamzam normally occurs in the body of compostions, such as a couple of royal hymns: Shulgi hymns B (273, 276) and E (34, 56), and Ishme-Dagan hymn A + V (= Enlildiriše 342, see below). The names of some types of hymnic compositions do not occur in subscripts but are rather mentioned in compositions containing references to various songs. For instance, the rare label arahi (a-ra-hi) is attested in a passage of a royal hymn known as the “Self-praise of Ishme-Dagan,” a king of Isin, in which arahi appears along with several generic and musical subscripts (Išme-Dagan A + V = Enlildiriše 340–43 [Tinney’s ms.]):

In some occasions, modern scholars use native Sumerian labels that pose some additional complications. For instance, the Early Dynastic zami hymns or litanies (see above) are named so by Assyriologists because they contain the expression za3-mi3—later on spelled za3-mi2 and included as a doxology in colophons (e.g., dnidaba za3-mi2 “Nidaba be praised,” “praise for Nidaba”)which meant “praise” as well as eventually “lyre,” as can be seen in Akkadian sammû (< za3-mi2) “lyre.” However, although the Early Dynastic zami hymns do constitute a homogenous corpus of litanies, in later usage zami can be a final doxological clause occurring in many different compositions of various genres, as well as a true rubric, as in the case of the balbale of Dumuzi and Enkimdu (or The Shepherd and the Farmer) mentioned above (Klein 1981a: 57 n. 138; Sefati 1998: 27 n. 63). It is interesting to note that the zami doxology occurs in narrative compositions (both “epics” and myths), in wisdom literature, and in some hymns, but not in laments (Wilcke 1975: 258). There are a few additional compositions that can be classified as songs. A particularly intriguing example is the Message of Ludingirra to his Mother, which borrows the erotic language of love lyrics to describe the anatomy of the purported author’s mother (Civil 1964b; Cooper 1971; Çıg4 and Kramer 1976). This very fellow’s name, Ludingirra, is mentioned in two other unique compositions as their author (Kramer 1960; Sjöberg 1983): an elegy to his father (Nannaya) and another one to his wife (Nawirtum). There is also an elegiac composition about a young lady who is awaiting the arrival of her lover’s corpse, after his death in a distant land (Kramer 1977). Aside from elegies, the aforementioned Song of the Hoe could be grouped together with other songs or, because of its contents, with the paradigmatic compositions, as was done above. Moreover, there is also a drinking song, which was always copied alongside the hymn to the beer goddess, Ninkasi (Civil 1964a). The letter-prayers, addressed to deities or seemingly deified Sumerian kings, can be frequently characterized as letters of petition, and seem best represented in the literary corpus from Old Babylonian Larsa (Hallo 1968; Böck 1996; Brisch 2007; COS 1: 532–34). Whereas the Sumerian literary letters (such as those in the Royal Correspondence of Ur) were written in prose, the letter-prayers exhibit all the devices and tropes one can find in other kinds of poetic texts. Nevertheless, it has been argued that the letter-prayers were a rather economic alternative for private individuals to
Gonzalo Rubio 69



produce inscribed votive objects, the letter-prayers themselves (Hallo 1968: 75). However, the language of the letter-prayers is poetically complex and at least a couple of them were commissioned by a king of Larsa: the letters from Sin-iddinam to Ninisina and to Utu (Brisch 2007: 141–78).
NOTE ON NAMES AND TRANSCRIPTIONS
Sumerian terms transliterated sign by sign are written in a different font (bold face), whereas tentative transcriptions or normalizations are in italics: er2-šem3-ma vs. eršemma. As is customary, italics are also used for Akkadian words. The sign š is employed in transliterations and transcriptions of terminology. However, names that occur frequently in modern scholarly works are written with sh; for example, Shulgi and Gilgamesh instead of Šulgi and Gilgameš. Consonantal gemination in Sumerian words is preserved, even when it may not be phonological but simply a matter of spelling (e.g., Inanna instead of Inana). Likewise, traditional transcriptions of names are kept, as in the case of Urukagina, a name that can be also read Irikagina, Uru’inimgina, Iri’inimgina, and even simply UruKAgina. Furthermore, although they are written with the same cuneiform signs, a simple h has been used for Sumerian words, but a hooked for Akkadian ones (e.g., hamt+u, hubullu). While it is difficult to know the exact nature of Sumerian h, Akkadian clearly preserved a segment that corresponds to a voiceless velar fricative in other Semitic languages. In transliterating Akkadian, I have opted for Assur instead of Ashur, Ashshur, or Aššur; the same applies to Assurbanipal. Since the second half of the second millennium, in Assyrian dialects graphic <š> was realized as /s/, and graphic <s> as /š/. Thus, first-millennium Assyrians pronounced Assur and not Aššur. In the case of Hittite, the only voiceless sibilant is written with š-signs. However, in the light of linguistic typology and external evidence (e.g., Hittite names written in Egyptian texts), it seems clear that they read those signs with an s (Rubio 2006c: 46). Thus, I write Mursili and Hattusa instead of Muršili/Murshili and Hattuša/Hattusha. Regarding Medieval and Modern toponyms, h and š are used for Arabic names, but kh and sh for Persian ones.

Book-length overviews of the Sumerian language can be found in Thomsen 1984 and Edzard 2003. For shorter approaches, see Michałowski 2004 and Rubio 2007a. Four volumes of the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary (corresponding to the letter B and most of letter A) have been published to date. However, this lexicographic project now continues online: http://psd .museum.upenn.edu/epsd/index.html. For overviews of Sumerian literature, see Hallo 1975; Krecher 1978; Edzard 1987–1990; Michałowski 1995a; and Wilcke 2004. A treatment of Old Babylonian literature, both in Sumerian and in Akkadian, can be found in Edzard 2004: 485–572. On various aspects of the Sumerian literary corpus, see Wilcke 1975; Black 1998; Veldhuis 2003 and 2004: 39–80; Vanstiphout 2003c; and Michałowski 2004. Jacobsen’s (1987) anthology of Sumerian literature is highly recommendable for its beauty, even if the translations are sometimes rather imaginative. A recent volume of similar scope (Black et al. 2004) is in essence a printout of the translations available through the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, which includes transliterations of the composite Sumerian texts of most compositions (with no variants or scores) alongside English translations: http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/. The Diachronic Corpus of Sumerian Literature provides a preliminary but useful list of Sumerian literary compositions arranged by periods, genres, and geographical areas: http://dcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk. Although the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) is currently more complete for administrative and economic documents and the literary texts tend to be mostly early, this essential project will eventually provide access to large numbers of cuneiform tablets, for many of which CDLI includes already excellent photographs: http://cdli.ucla.edu/index. html.

NOTES
1. For different approaches to the issue of the death of Sumerian as a spoken language, see Michałowski 2006a; Woods 2006; Rubio 2006a. 2. Within the general assumption that the Sumerian language must have come from elsewhere, a theory concerning a pre-Sumerian substratum of vocabulary was articulated half a century ago. This alleged lexical substratum would constitute the only remains of a hypothetical human group that would have inhabited southern Mesopotamia before the speakers of Sumerian. However, the substratum lexical items turn out to be Semitic loanwords, Hurrian, Arealwörter (words occurring in many languages within a specific, albeit frequently large, geographical area) or Wanderwörter (words that travel with the objects or techniques they name), or properly Sumerian terms. See Rubio 2005: 317. 3. There are exceptions to this. For instance, in Gilgamesh and Huwawa A, some manuscripts write as one single line what all the others have as two separate lines. For instance, what in other manuscripts (from Nippur, Sippar, and Ur) appear as lines 154–55, 157–58, and 159–60, were merged into single lines in a tablet from Kish; see Delnero 2006: 656, 2401, 2464–67. Still, this phenomenon is not very common. In the Decad (see below), a corpus of ten compositions amounting to a total of more than 1,400 lines, one can find only fourteen instances of alterations in line division (i.e., less than 1%); see Delnero 2006: 656. 4. One should distinguish between subscripts, which usually consist of a oneline descriptive label, and colophons. Colophons can be substantially longer and may include information concerning three distinct categories: the manuscript itself (e.g., number of lines, title, and tablet number); the persons involved in the production of the manuscript (the scribe, the person who requested the copy, etc.); and other additional information and corollaries, such as the date and a final prayer or doxology.

14. See Englund 1998: 99–102; Goodnick Westenholz 1998; Rubio 2003: 203–4. For a different approach to this text (as a lexical list), see Veldhuis 2006. The name “Tribute List” is a misnomer based on understanding the sequence ša3 gu2 gi4 (or ša3 gun2 gi4) as “bringing in as tribute.” An Old Babylonian manuscript of this composition (SLT 42) renders it as ša3 gu2-bi nam-gi4, a well-attested idiom that has been translated in different ways, as in Gudea Cylinder A i 5–7: “the heart was moved to overflow, the heart flowed over” (Jacobsen 1987: 388); “in fact, the flood again reached the banks” (Edzard 1997: 69). In the light of other attestations, the general meaning of ša3 gu2 gi4 as “to overflow” seems clear (Steinkeller 2004: 143). 15. It is interesting to note that in UD.GAL.NUN texts, some signs have a peculiar shape unique to this corpus (Krecher 1992: 297–98). Sometimes the correspondences are rather simple, as when sign shapes are modified or similar-looking signs are used instead: AB is substituted by NISAG (LAK-159) because they look alike (Krecher 1992: 298). Moreover, Krecher (1992: 299) has tentatively identified the general mechanisms involved in UD.GAL.NUN orthography: (a) changes in vowel, normally toward the back of the mouth (the suffix -bi “its” written as -BU8); (b) changes in consonants; (c) omission, addition, or alteration of final consonant; (d) transposition of consonant-vowel or vowel-consonant sequences; and (e) insertion and addition of an extra syllable. These mechanisms often co-occur: nun written BU (b, c); an written UD (a,c); the suffix -zu/-zu5 “your” written -IŠ (a, b, e); nir written NAGAR (a, f). 16. In spite of their secondary find-spot, these texts can be dated because they were found along with many Ur III administrative documents. Moreover, this debris area (the fill of the Parthian platform) does not contain Old Babylonian literary texts, the only ones with which Ur III literary tablets could be confused in terms of paleography. 17. On the Ur III literary corpus from Nippur, see Rubio 2000 and forthcoming. 18. On the problems posed by the edubba as a physical reality, see for instance Volk 2000: 7–8; George 2005: 132. 19. The presence of school tablets at the palace of Sinkashid (Sîn-kaašid) in Old Babylonian Uruk is connected to the training of bureaucrats, rather than to a palace library (Cavigneaux 1982). The school texts found in this palace have little in common with other school texts from Old Babylonian Uruk; cp. Cavigneaux 1996: 77–92. 20. The name Nidaba is frequently transcribed as Nisaba, but the latter simply reflects the Akkadian pronunciation of the Sumerian name. 21. For references to texts editions, see Charpin 2004: 407 (Ur), 409–10 (Uruk), 416–17 (Larsa), 418–22 (Nippur), and 423 (Isin). 22. There are two closely connected places called Sippar (or Sippir), only 5 km. apart: Sippar-Yahrurum (Abuu Habba) and Sippar-Amnanum (Tell ed-Der). Both sites are near modern Yusuf īyah, on the east bank of the Euphrates. For an important sample of Old Babylonian literary texts from Sippar (those at the British Museum), see Alster and Geller 1990. For references to editions of texts found in northern Babylonian sites, see Charpin 2004: 428–29 (Babylon), 429–30 (Kish), 433–39 (Sippar), 444 (Tell armal), 445–46 (Meturan). 23. The actual archaeological context of this reconstructed library assigned to Tiglath-pileser I seems to be Neo-Assyrian, although Middle Assyrian tablets were

found among several Neo-Assyrian literary and scholarly texts—in the southwest courtyard of the Assur temple at Assur. See Pedersén 1985: 31–42. 24. On these peripheral archives in general, see Pedersén 1998: 44–56 (Hattusa), 61–68 (Emar), and 68–80 (Ugarit). For a convenient edition of peripheral texts from Ugarit and Emar during the Middle Babylonian period, see Kämmerer 1998. Regarding the Sumero-Akkadian bilinguals from Hattusa, see Cooper 1971–1972. 25. See Edzard in Labat and Edzard 1974: 9–34; Michałowski 1980–1983: 52, 57; 1987: 39 n. 9. 26. The use of the term matter refers to Jehan Bodel, the twelfth-century Picardian jongleur, epic poet, author of fabliaux, and dramatist, who divided medieval heroic narrative into three materes or matières: France, Britanny, and Rome. 27. The name is written en-suh-kešda-an-na. The sign KEŠ2 has, among others, these two readings: kešda and gir11. Thus, both readings of the name are theoretically possible: Ensukeshdan(n)a and Ensuhgiran(n)a. The name seemingly contains the word for a kind of headgear (perhaps “diadem”), which could be read suh-keš2, suh-kešda, or suh-gir11. For philological reasons, the reading Ensuhkeshdanna is preferred here. 28. For recent translations of these compositions, see George 1999: 141–208; Frayne in Foster 2001: 99–155. Some believe that Bilgames is the Sumerian name of Gilgamesh, and use the former when dealing with Sumerian texts and the latter with Akkadian ones. However, this is a mistaken assumption based on a misunderstanding of the Sumerian spelling of the name; see Rubio, forthcoming. 29. Michałowski (2003b: 199) sees here an echo of Enlil and Ninlil (line 30): ga14-la-mu tur-ra-am3 peš11 nu-mu-un-zu “my vagina is too small, it has not experienced pregnancy yet.” Peshtur may be part of the typically Mediterranean use of “fig” in sexual and genital metaphors. For instance, Greek sûkon “fig” referred to the anus and to an anal sore, and had a parallel in Latin ficus, with the same usage. Later on, the Latin term came to denote the female genitalia—cp. Italia fica and Spanish higo—as sûkon had already done in Aristophanes (Peace 1354); see Adams 1982: 113–14. 30. See especially Cooper 1981; Vanstiphout 1986b, 1987; Civil 1999–2000; Wilcke 1998. 31. On the Sumerian epics as folktales, see Komoróczy 1974; Alster 1990; Edzard 1994. 32. On Ninurta the textual tradition about him, see Annus 2002. 33. On the Netherworld in Sumerian literature and magic, see Katz 2003. 34. The most common and earliest transitional formula is this: X (gištukul) ba(-an)-sag3 nam-lugal-bi Y-še3 ba-de6: “place X was destroyed (with weapons); its kingship was carried to place Y.” A common variant of this formula starts with X ba-gul “place X was destroyed.” Other formulas occur in other manuscripts: X ba-šub “X was abandoned”; X ba-šub-be2-en “I will bring to an end (the matter of) X”; and later recensions and manuscripts have X bala-bi ba-kur2 “the turn of X was alienated/altered.” 35. In fact, among the Old Babylonian manuscripts of Sumerian literary compositions, the earliest dated one corresponds to a damaged tablet from Sippar, which contains a section of the Nungal hymn. See Alster and Geller 1990: no. 27; Michałowski 1995b: 50.

36. New Shulgi hymns are still being identified in museum collections; see Sjöberg 2005. 37. Only in Dutch can one find an annotated translation of the Sumerian disputations and dialogues, along with other edubba-related compositions: Vanstiphout 2003b. 38. The exact borders of the Iranian region the Mesopotamians called Elam varied depending on periods and sources. In early texts, Elam seems to refer mostly to the region of Anshan and its surroundings, not including Susa. Anshan designated both a region (the highlands of Faars) and its capital (Tal-i Malyan or Malīan, near Shīraz). Thus, in the Gudea cylinders (Cyl. A xv 6–7) we are told that “the Elamites came to him (Gudea) from Elam, the Susians came to him from Susa” (Edzard 1997: 78). In the second and first millennia, Elam included the region in which Susa lay: Susiana, corresponding to the plain and lower Zagros foothills of modern Khuuzestaan. This change is explained partly because Susa was under Mesopotamian control at different times during the Sargonic and Ur III periods, but it became one of the seats of Elamite royalty during the early second millennium. See Vallat 1980; Potts 1999: 5–9, 160–78. 39. See Krecher 1966: 28; Wilcke 1975: 254, 262, 266–73; Krispijn 1990: 3–4; Kilmer 1993–1997: 470. 40. See Krecher 1966: 19–23, 30–31; Kutscher 1975; Wilcke 1975: 285–86; Kramer 1982; Cohen 1974; 1981: 4–6; 1988; Black 1985, 1991; Volk 1989; Schretter 1990: 93–96; Kilmer 1993–1997: 464–65; Flückiger-Hawker 1999: 87–91. 41.

It is tempting to think that Sumerian šir3 is the ultimate origin of the word for “song” in Northwest Semitic languages: Ugaritic šr, Hebrew šîr, and Aramaic šyr. These words have no cognates outside Northwest Semitic; e.g., Arabic ši r (“poem, poetry”) cannot be related to them. 46. See Wilcke 1975: 287; Cooper 1978: 3–4; Ludwig 1990: 38–40; Schretter 1990: 91. 47. The reading šir3-še11 (še11 = NAR) seems problematic, as še11 means “to be cold, to cool” (Ludwig 1990: 192–93). 48. On the Indo-European and Greek terminology and metaphors connecting poetry with weaving and joining, see Schmitt 1967: 296–301; Nagy 1996: 61–76. 49. See Cohen 1975; Wilcke 1975: 288; Schretter 1990: 90–91; Flückiger-Hawker 1999: 260–63. 50. See Sjöberg 1960: 171, 181; Cooper 1970, 1988; Ludwig 1990: 200–201. On the Akkadian šuilas and the genre in general, see Zgoll 2003a, 2003b; Mayer 1976. 51. See Klein 1980: XXIII-XXVI; Krispijn 1990: 16. In spite of Klein’s suggestion, šumunša was probably never the name of a musical instrument.
