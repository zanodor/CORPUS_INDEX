Silver karṣāpaṇa c. 5th-4th century BCE Weight: 3.25 gm., Dim: 20 x 27 mm. Four punches: sun, 6-arm, and two others, plus banker's marks /Blank This coin appears to have only four official punches: the sun, 6-arm symbol, elephant right, and chakra symbol. The sun has oblique rays, which is seen only on very early types, and the form of the elephant is also an early type. The chakra symbol, with the two "windows" below, containing pellets, is not listed in Gupta and Hardaker's symbol list. This coin may therefore be one of the earliest of the karṣāpaṇa series, where there were only
four official punches. https://coinindia.com/galleries

Silver. A single punchmark in shape of a double axe with two taurine symbols and a dot above // Blank. 4mm, 0.13 grams. Terry Hardaker "The Mashaka Fractional Coinage of Ancient India" Group D #29 var These tiny mashakas (or, more correctly, mashas), were minted during the late Magadha/early Mauryan period in northern India. They were first discovered and published in 1924, but escaped much attention from numismatists, with a notable exception of Terry Hardaker's "The Mashaka Fractional Coinage of Ancient India" which he published in 1999. They were probably worth 1/16th of a silver karshapana and numerous different types were minted using the normal punch technique. The coins are poorly understood, and only a few types are published.
