If the reading of line 3 is ta-Da-gha it may relate to a word attested
by Pāṇini as tāḍa—gha m. a kind of artificer
(blacksmith?), Pāṇini 3-2,55. Thus, the later-day holder of the
professional calling card (a possible descendant from the days of
Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization) proclaims himself
as Majhitha tāḍagha 'Boatman, textile dyer, smith or goldsmith'.
The semantics of tāḍa—gha 'goldsmith' are consistent with the
image on the chest of the one-horned young bull with forward
thrusting, spiny horn which is read rebus in Meluhha as singhin
rebus: singi 'ornament gold'. ताड tāḍa-घः , -घातः an artificer who
beats or hammers, a smith (Apte) I suggest that this reading of Line
3 is the most probable reading to signify ‘goldsmith’ of the
professional calling card.

Indus Script gold stylus, writing

--Stylus with nib for free-hand writing using ink (iron-oxide liquid pigment)
I suggest that the Kernoi rings were 'ink-stands' containing iron
oxide liquid for free-hand writing to inscribe on metal. A superb
example is provided by the Mohenjo-daro gold pectoral with an
Indus Script inscription. This gold pectoral is a writing instrument, a
metallic stylus with a nib.

Rebus: aya 'iron'(Gujarati) ayas 'metal' (Rigveda)
Thus, the inscription is: kancu sal (bronze workshop), dhatu aya kaṇḍ
kolami mineral, metal, furnace/fire-altar smithy.
The inscription is a professional calling card -- describing professional
competence and ownership of specified items of property -- of the wearer of the
pendant.This is an extraordinary evidence of the Indus writing system written
down, with hieroglyphs inscribed using a coloured paint, on an object.

“Personal ornaments...Jewellery and Necklaces...Netting needles (?) Three very
curious objects found with the studs and the necklace appear to be netting needles
of gold. They are shown just above the ear-studs and also in the lower right-hand
corner of Pl. CLI, B, 3-5 and 12-14. The largest of these needles (E 2044a) is 2.5
inches long... The third needle (E 2044c) is only 1.7 inches long with the point
0.3 inch in length...The handles seem to have been drawn, as there is no sign of a
soldered line, but the caps at either end were soldered on with an alloy that is very
little lighter in colour than the gold itself. The two smaller needles have evidently
been held between the teeth on more than one occasion.” (p.521)." (John
Marshall, MIC, p.521; comments on Pl. CLI,B3)
The pendants were perhaps worn with a thread of fibre passing through the eye of
the needle-like ending of the pendants. Why needle-like endings? Maybe, the
pendants were used as 'writing' devices 1) either to engrave hieroglyphs into
objects; 2)or to use the needle-ending like a metal nib to dip into a colored ink or
liquid or zinc-oxide paste or cinnabar-paste.

"Ochre (rarely spelled ocher and often referred to as yellow ochre) is one of a
variety of forms of iron oxide which are described as earth-based pigments. These
pigments, used by ancient and modern artists, are made of iron oxyhydroxide,
which is to say they are natural minerals and compounds composed of varying
proportions of iron (Fe3 or Fe2), oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H)." (Hirst, Kris (15
April 2017). "Ochre - The Oldest Known Natural Pigment in the
World") https://www.thoughtco.com/ochre-the-oldest-known-natural-pigment
172032 "Ochre (British English) (/ˈoʊkər/ OH-kər; from Greek: ὤχρα, from
ὠχρός, ōkhrós, pale) or ocher (American English) is a natural clay earth
pigmentwhich is a mixture of ferric oxide and varying amounts of clay and sand.It
ranges in colour from yellow to deep orange or brown. It is also the name of the
colours produced by this pigment, especially a light brownish-yellow. A variant of
ochre containing a large amount of hematite, or dehydrated iron oxide, has a
reddish tint known as "red ochre" (or, in some
dialects, ruddle)." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochre

Holly Pittman notes: “Impressed on a series of small tablets is an image of a demonic
feline-like creature in a posture of reverence or power, kneeling in a high-prowed boat with its front legs held together at the chest. In front and back of the creature are two pointed forms that could be either spears or oars. Under the boat is a large fish; to the side is a tall bundle of tied reeds, a shape that is a sign in the Proto-Elamite script. The representation of a boat is most unusual among Proto-Elamite seals. At least five tablets, in addition to this one, are impressed with the same seal. They carry inscriptions which, although they cannot be read, were certainly written by the same hand and all end with the same series of signs.” (After Fig. 48. Tablet with impression of a demonic creature in a boat. Clay h. 1 3⁄4 in. (4.5 cm); w. 2 5/8 in. (6.7 cm) Proto-Elamite period, ca. 3100-2900 BCE Sb 4832). loc.cit.

'Based on cuneiform documents from Mesopotamia we know that there was at least one Meluhhan village in Akkad at that time, with people called 'Son of Meluhha' living there. The cuneiform inscription (ca. 2020 BCE) says that the cylinder seal belonged to Shu-ilishu, who was a translator of the Meluhhan language. "The presence in Akkad of a translator of the Meluhhan language suggests that he may have been literate and could read the undeciphered Indus script. This in turn suggests that there may be bilingual Akkadian/Meluhhan tablets somewhere in Mesopotamia. Although such documents may not exist, Shu-ilishu's cylinder seal offers a glimmer of hope for the future in unraveling the mystery of the Indus script." (Gregory L. Possehl,Shu-ilishu's cylinder seal, Expedition, Vol. 48, Number 1, pp. 4243).http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/481/What%20in%20the%20World.pdf

‘worker in wood and iron’; semantics are signified by the signifier badhi, barha ‘boar’. Thus, the boar hieroglyph signifies prosperity resulting from working
and trade in bell-metal, brass.
