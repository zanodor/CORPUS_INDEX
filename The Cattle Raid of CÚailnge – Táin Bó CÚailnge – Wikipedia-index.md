Táin Bó Cúailnge
Táin Bó Cúailnge (Irish pronunciation: [t ̪ɣaːnj
boː ˈkuəljɲə]; "the driving-off of cows of
Cooley", commonly known as The Cattle
Raid of Cooley or The Táin) is a legendary
tale from early Irish literature which is
often considered an epic, although it is
written primarily in prose rather than
verse. It tells of a war against Ulster by
Connacht queen Medb and her husband
Ailill,[1] who intend to steal the stud bull
Donn Cuailnge and are opposed only by
teenage Ulster hero Cú Chulainn.[2]
The Táin is traditionally set in the 1st century in an essentially pre
Christian heroic age, and is the central text of a group of tales known
as the Ulster Cycle. It survives in three written versions or
"recensions" in manuscripts of the 12th century and later, the first a
compilation largely written in Old Irish, the second a more consistent
work in Middle Irish, and the third an Early Modern Irish version.
Synopsis
The Táin is preceded by a number of remscéla, or pre-tales, which
provide background on the main characters and explain the
presence of certain characters from Ulster in the Connacht camp,
the curse that causes the temporary inability of the remaining
Ulstermen to fight and the magic origins of the bulls Donn Cuailnge
and Finnbhennach. The eight remscéla chosen by Thomas Kinsella
for his 1969 translation are sometimes taken to be part of the Táin
itself, but come from a variety of manuscripts of different dates.



Several other tales exist which are described as remscéla to the Táin,
some of which have only a tangential relation to it.
The first recension begins with Ailill and Medb assembling their army
in Cruachan, the purpose of this military build-up taken for granted.
The second recension adds a prologue in which Ailill and Medb
compare their respective wealths and find that the only thing that
distinguishes them is Ailill's possession of the phenomenally fertile
bull Finnbhennach, who had been born into Medb's herd but scorned
being owned by a woman so decided to transfer himself to Ailill's.
Medb determines to get the equally potent Donn Cuailnge from
Cooley to equal her wealth with her husband. She successfully
negotiates with the bull's owner, Dáire mac Fiachna, to rent the
animal for a year until her messengers, drunk, reveal that they would
have taken the bull by force even if they had not been allowed to
borrow it. The deal breaks down, and Medb raises an army, including
Ulster exiles led by Fergus mac Róich and other allies, and sets out
to capture Donn Cuailnge.
The men of Ulster are disabled by an apparent illness, the ces
noínden (literally "debility of nine (days)", although it lasts several
months). A separate tale explains this as the curse of the goddess
Macha, who imposed it after being forced by the king of Ulster to
race against a chariot while heavily pregnant.[3] The only person fit
to defend Ulster is seventeen-year-old Cú Chulainn, and he lets the
army take Ulster by surprise because he's off on a tryst when he
should be watching the border. Cú Chulainn, assisted by his
charioteer Láeg, wages a guerrilla campaign against the advancing
army, then halts it by invoking the right of single combat at fords,
defeating champion after champion in a stand-off lasting months.
However, he is unable to prevent Medb from capturing the bull.
Cú Chulainn is both helped and hindered by supernatural figures.



Before one combat the Morrígan visits him in the form of a beautiful
young woman and offers him her love, but he spurns her. She then
reveals herself and threatens to interfere in his next fight. She does
so, first in the form of an eel who trips him in the ford, then as a wolf
who stampedes cattle across the ford, and finally as a heifer at the
head of the stampede, but in each form Cú Chulainn wounds her.
After he defeats his opponent, the Morrígan appears to him in the
form of an old woman milking a cow, with wounds corresponding to
the ones Cú Chulainn gave her in her animal forms. She offers him
three drinks of milk. With each drink he blesses her, and the
blessings heal her wounds.
After a particularly arduous combat he is visited by another
supernatural figure, Lugh, who reveals himself to be Cú Chulainn's
father. Lugh puts Cú Chulainn to sleep for three days while he works
his healing arts on him. While Cú Chulainn sleeps the youth corps of
Ulster come to his aid but are all slaughtered. When Cú Chulainn
wakes he undergoes a spectacular ríastrad or "distortion", in which
his body twists in its skin and he becomes an unrecognisable
monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He makes a bloody
assault on the Connacht camp and avenges the youth corps sixfold.
After this extraordinary incident, the sequence of single combats
resumes, although on several occasions Medb breaks the agreement
by sending several men against him at once. When Fergus, his
foster-father, is sent to fight him, Cú Chulainn agrees to yield to him
on the condition that Fergus yields the next time they meet. Finally
there is a physically and emotionally gruelling three-day duel
between the hero and his foster-brother and best friend, Ferdiad. Cú
Chulainn wins, killing Ferdiad with the legendary spear, the Gáe
Bolga.
Eventually the debilitated Ulstermen start to rouse, one by one at



first, then en masse, and the final battle begins. To begin with Cú
Chulainn sits it out, recovering from his wounds. Fergus has
Conchobar at his mercy, but is prevented from killing him by Cormac
Cond Longas, Conchobar's son and Fergus' foster-son, and in his
rage cuts the tops off three hills with his sword. Finally, Cú Chulainn
enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who makes good on his
promise and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's
other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. She does, however,
manage to bring Donn Cuailnge back to Connacht, where the bull
fights Finnbhennach, kills him, but is mortally wounded, and wanders
around Ireland creating placenames before finally returning home to
die of exhaustion.
The image of Cú Chulainn dying, tied to a post so that even in death
he might face his enemies standing, a pose which was adopted by
early 20th-century Irish republicans[4] does not come from the Táin
but from a later story. However it has been incorporated into some
oral versions of the Táin, in which Cú Chulainn, like Donn Cuailnge,
dies from wounds sustained during his final duel with Ferdiad.
Text
Manuscripts
Táin Bó Cúailnge has survived in three recensions. The first consists
of a partial text in Lebor na hUidre (the "Book of the Dun Cow"), a
late 11th-/early 12th-century manuscript compiled in the monastery
at Clonmacnoise, and another partial text of the same version in the
14th-century manuscript called the Yellow Book of Lecan. These two
sources overlap, and a complete text can be reconstructed by
combining them. This recension is a compilation of two or more
earlier versions, indicated by the number of duplicated episodes and
references to "other versions" in the text.[5] Many of the episodes are



superb, written in the characteristic terse prose of the best Old Irish
literature, but others are cryptic summaries, and the whole is rather
disjointed. Parts of this recension can be dated from linguistic
evidence to the 8th century, and some of the verse passages may be
even older.
The second recension is found in the 12th-century manuscript
known as the Book of Leinster. This appears to have been a
syncretic exercise by a scribe who brought together the Lebor na
hUidre materials and unknown sources for the Yellow Book of Lecan
materials to create a coherent version of the epic. While the result is
a satisfactory narrative whole, the language has been modernised
into a much more florid style, with all of the spareness of expression
of the earlier recension lost in the process.
The Book of Leinster version ends with a colophon in Latin which
says:
But I who have written this story, or rather this fable, give no
credence to the various incidents related in it. For some things in
it are the deceptions of demons, other poetic figments; some are
probable, others improbable; while still others are intended for
the delectation of foolish men.
An incomplete third recension is known from twelfth-century
fragments.[6]
Origins
Despite the date of the surviving manuscripts, a version of the Táin
may have been put to writing already in the eighth century.[6] There
is reason to suspect that the Táin had a considerable oral history
before any of it was committed to writing: for example, the poem
Conailla Medb michuru ("Medb enjoined illegal contracts") by



Luccreth moccu Chiara, dated to c. 600, tells the story of Fergus'
exile with Ailill and Medb, which the poet describes as sen-eolas
("old knowledge"). Two further seventh-century poems also allude to
elements of the story: in Verba Scáthaige ("Words of Scáthach"), the
warrior-woman Scáthach prophesies Cú Chulainn's combats at the
ford; and Ro-mbáe laithi rordu rind ("We had a great day of plying
spear-points"), attributed to Cú Chulainn himself, refers to an
incident in the Boyhood Deeds section of the Táin.[7]
The high regard in which the written account was held is suggested
by a ninth-century triad, that associated the Táin with the following
wonders: "that the cuilmen [apparently a name for Isidore of Seville's
Etymologiae] came to Ireland in its stead; the dead relating it to the
living, viz. Fergus mac Róich reciting it to Ninníne the poet at the
time of Cormac mac Faeláin; one year's protection to him to whom it
is related."[6]
In translation and adaptation
19th century translations of the work include Bryan O'Looney's
translation made in the 1870s, as Tain Bo Cualnge, based on the
Book of Leinster in Trinity College Library, Dublin.[8] John O'Daly's
also translated the work in 1857, but it is considered a poor
translation.[9] No published translation of the work was made until
the early 20th century - the first English translation was provided by
Winifred L. Faraday in 1904, based on the Lebor na hUidre and the
Yellow Book of Lecan; a German translation by Ernst Windisch was
published at around the same time based on the Book of Leinster.[10]
Translated sections of the text had been published in the late 19th
century, including one from on the Book of Leinster by Standish
Hayes O'Grady in The Cuchullin Saga (ed. Eleanor Hull, 1898), as
well as extracts, and introductory text.[11] Lady Gregory's Cuchulain



of Muirthemne (1903) also contains a paraphrased version of the
tale. There were also several works based on the tale published in
the very late 19th and early 20th century often with a focus on the
hero Cú Chulainn, such as Cuchulain, the Hound of Ulster (E.Hull,
1911); Dun Dealgan, Cuchulain's Home Fort (H.G. Tempest, 1910);
Cuchulain of Muirtheimhne (A.M. Skelly, 1908); The Coming of
Cuculain (S. O'Grady, 1894); and several others; additionally a
number of prose works from the same period took the tale as basis
or inspiration, including works by W.B. Yeats, Aubrey Thomas de
Vere, Alice Milligan, George Sigerson, Samuel Ferguson, Charles
Leonard Moore, Fiona Macleod, as well as ballad versions from
Scotland.[12] Peadar Ua Laoghaire adapted the work as a closet
drama, serialized in the Cork Weekly Examiner (1900-1).[13]
In 1914 Joseph Dunn authored an English translation The Ancient
Irish Epic Tale Táin Bó Cúalnge based primarily on the Book of
Leinster.[14] Cecile O'Rahilly published academic editions/translations
of both recensions, Táin Bó Cúalnge from the Book of Leinster
(1967), and Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension 1 (1976), as well as an
edition of the later Stowe Version, The Stowe version of Táin Bó
Cuailnge (1961).
As of 2018 two translations by Irish poets are available in mass
market editions: Thomas Kinsella's The Táin (1969) and Ciarán
Carson's The Táin (2007). Both are based primarily on the first
recension with passages added from the second, although they
differ slightly in their selection and arrangement of material.
Kinsella's translation is illustrated by Louis le Brocquy (see Louis le
Brocquy Táin illustrations) and also contains translations of a
selection of remscéla.
Victorian era adapters omitted some aspects of the tale, either for
political reasons relating to Irish Nationalism, or to avoid offending



the sensibilities of their readers with bodily functions or sex.[15]
(Tymoczo 1999), focusing on translations and adaptation of "The
Tain", analysed how 19th and 20th century writers used the original
texts in creating Irish myths as part of the process of decolonization
(from the United Kingdom), and so redacted elements that did not
show Cuchulain in a suitably heroic light. Not only was sex, and
bodily functions removed, but also humor. The version by Lady
Gregory (1903) took on a more 'folkish' aspect, whereas in O'Grady's
version (see Hull 1898) the protagonists more resembled chivalrous
medieval knights.[16]
Several writers bowdlerized the source: for example the naked
women sent to attempt to placate Cú Chulainn were omitted by most
adapters of the Victorian period, or their nakedness reduced.[17]
Others interpreted the tale to their own ends - One of Peadar Ua
Laoghaire's adaptations of the work, the play "Méibh", included a
temperance message, blaming the conflict over the bull on the
drunkenness of the Connacht messengers.[18] In Ua Laoghaire's
serialization Medb retains her role as a powerful woman, but her
sexuality, exploitation of her daughter Fionnabhair, and references to
menstruation are heavily euphemized.[19] Slightly later works such as
Stories from the Tain (Strachan 1908) and the derived Giolla na Tana
(Strachan & O'Nolan 1914) were more accurate.[20]
The version by (Kinsella 1969) is considered to be the first (English)
translation that accurately included both grotesque and sexual
aspects of the tale;[16] however the German translation by (Windisch
1905) is considered to be complete, and lacks alterations and
omissions due to conflicts of interests in the mind of contemporary
Irish scholars.[21]
Comparison of translations
Fecht n-óen do Ailill & do Meidb íar ndérgud a rígleptha dóib i



Crúachanráith Chonnacht, arrecaim comrád chind cherchailli eturru. 'Fírbriathar, a ingen,' bar Ailill, 'is maith ben ben dagfir.' 'Maith omm', bar ind ingen, 'cid dia tá lat-su ón?'
Gaelic text from (O'Rahilly 2014)
It was once upon a time when Ailell and Meave where in RathCruachan Connacht, and they had spread their royal couch. Between them then ensued a 'bolsterconversation'. "Woman," said Ailell, "a true saying 'tis : 'a good man's wife is good.'" "Good indeed," she answered, "but why quotest thou the same?"
Standish Hayes O'Grady in (Hull 1898)
Once of a time, that Ailill and Medb had spread their royal bed in Cruachan, the stronghold of Connacht, such was the pillow-talk that befell betwixt them :
Quoth Ailill : "True is the saying, lady, 'She is a well-off woman that is a rich man's wife' " "Aye, that she is," answered the wife ; "but wherefore opin'st thou so ?"
(Dunn 1914)
Then that most royal pair went to their sleeping
In their own rath and their own royal house ; And while their heads were on their kingly pillow, There rose this talk betwixt them. Al-yill said : "'Tis a true word, O woman, it is good To be the wife of a strong man !" Maev said : "'Tis a true word; but wherefore dost thou cite it?"
(Hutton 1924)
ONCE upon a time it befell Ailill and Medb that, when their royal bed had been prepared for them in Ráth Crúachain in Connacht, they spoke together as they lay on their pillow. 'In truth, woman' said Ailill, 'she is a well-off woman who is the wife of a nobleman'. 'She is indeed' said the woman. 'Why do you think so?'
(O'Rahilly 2014) [orig 1966]
When the royal bed was laid out for Ailill and Medb in Cruachan fort in Connacht, they had this talk on the
One night when the royal bed had been prepared from Ailill and Medb in Crúchan Fort in Connacht, the



pillows :
"It is true what they say, love," Ailill said, "it is well for the wife of a wealthy man." "True enough," the woman said. "What put that in your mind?"
(Kinsella 1969)
engaged in pillow-talk:
"It's true what they say, girl," said Ailill, "Well-off woman, wealthy man's wife." "True enough," said the woman. "What makes you say it?"
(Carson 2007)
Remscéla
The story of the Táin relies on a range of independently transmitted
back-stories, known as remscéla ('fore-tales'). Some may in fact
have been composed independently of the Táin and subsequently
linked with it later in their transmission. As listed by Ruairí Ó hUiginn,
they are:[6]
De Faillsigud Tána Bó Cuailnge (How the Táin Bó Cuailnge was
found), recounting how the story of the Táin was lost and
recovered.
Táin Bó Regamna (The cattle raid of Regamain)
Táin Bó Regamon (The cattle raid of Regamon)
Táin Bó Fraích ('The cattle Raid of Froech'): Froech mac Idaith is
a Connacht warrior, killed in Cú Chulainn in the Táin; this tale
gives him some back-story.
Táin Bó Dartada (The cattle raid of Dartaid)
Táin Bó Flidhais ('The cattle raid of Flidais'), a relatively late story
drawing on older material
Echtrae Nerai ('The Adventure of Nera')
Aislinge Oengusa ('The Dream of Oengus'). Oengus Mac ind Óc,
son of the Dagda has no part in the Táin Bó Cúailnge as we have
it, but this tale relates how the otherworld woman Caer
Ibormeith came to him in a vision how Oengus found her



through the aid of Medb and Ailill. According to the story, this is
why he helped them in their cattle-raid.
Compert Con Culainn ('The Conception of Cú Chulainn')
De Chophur in Dá Mucado (Of the cophur of the two
swineherds)
Fochann Loingsi Fergusa meic Róig (The cause of Fergus mac
Róich's exile), only the beginning of which survives, apparently
explaining how Fergus came to be part of the army of Connacht
Longas mac nUislenn ('The Exile of the Sons of Uisliu'),
explaining how Fergus and various other Ulster exiles came to
be in the army of Connacht
Tochmarc Ferbe (The wooing of Ferb).
Ces Ulad (The debility of the Ulstermen), not actually
considered one of the remscéla, but providing an important
account of why Macha curses the Ulaid: they made her race
against the king's horses while she was pregnant. The tale's
primary purpose, however, is to provide an aetiology for the
place-name Emain Machae.
