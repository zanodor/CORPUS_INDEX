Ram's curved horns are Indus Script hieroglyphs,signify meḍho 'iron merchant' found in Anthropomorphs of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization
Silver artifacts similar to copper hoards in Indian Museum, Calcutta. I suggest that these horned artifacts are NOT the horns of a cow but characteristic curved horns of a ram.
Such curved horns characterstic of a ram is an Indus Script hieroglyph: M. mẽḍhrū̃ n. ʻ sheep ʼ.(CDIAL 10311) Des. menda 'ram' rebus 1: meḍ (Ho.); mẽṛhet 'iron' Munda.Ho.) rebus 2: meḍho 'helper of merchant'. Thus, an iron merchant.

Curator's comments: See RL file 6616 (29/6/1995); also Research Lab file 4992 of 12/09/1983 where XRF analysis of surface indicates composition as tin bronze with approx 10% tin and traces of arsenic, nickel, silver and lead. Dalton's inclusion in the 'Catalogue of the Oxus Treasure' among a small group of comparative items has unfortunately led to recurrent confusion over the date and provenance of this piece. It was first believed to be Achaemenid in date (Dalton, 'Catalogue of the Oxus Treasure', p. 48), labelled as such in 1975 in the former Iranian Room and thus suggested to be an Achaemenid scabbard chape (P R S Moorey CORRES 1975, based on an example said to have been excavated by P. Bernard at Ai Khanoum or seen by him in Kabul Bazaar, cf. P. Bernard CORRES 1976). It has also been assigned a 4th-5th century AD Sasanian date (P. Amiet, 1967, in 'Revue du Louvre' 17, pp. 281-82). However, its considerably earlier - late 3rd mill. BC Bronze Age - date has now been clearly demonstrated following the discovery of large numbers of objects of related form in south-east Iran and Bactria, and it has since been recognised and/or cited as such, for instance by H. Pittmann (hence archaeometallurgical analysis in 1983; R. Maxwell-Hyslop, 1988a, "British Museum axe no. 123628: a Bactrian bronze", 'Bulletin of the Asia Institute' 1 (NS), pp. 17-26; F.

It is not mere coincidence that Varāha signifies an ancient gold coin. Another anthropomorph rplaces the young bull frieze on the chest of the ram with a ‘fish’ hieroglyph. ayo ‘fish’ rebus: aya ‘iron’ ayas ‘alloy metal’.

The golden anthropomorph discovered in Sanauli in 2006-7 excavations,
compares with four types of bronze anthropomorphs found in many parts of Sarasvati Civilization, including Lothal. The gold anthropomorph dated to ca. 2000 BCE signifies a standing person with spread legs. He signifies a dance-posture.
This golden anthropomorph is an Indus Script hypertext:
karaṇa 'dance step, dance posture' rebus: karaṇa 'scribe'. meṭṭu 'step' meḍ iron, मेधा, धन, मेधः' yajna.
A more elaborate inscription occurs on another anthropomorph.
The boar hieroglyph is addded to the head. 'Forward-thrusting, spiny-horned young bull' (unicorn) is shown on the chest of the ram's curved horns as arms and spread legs of the anthropomorph. There is also a Brahmi over-write on this anthropomorph. The decipherment is detailed at: Brāhmī inscription on Indus Script anthropomorph reads: symbol of माांझीथा Majhīthā sadya 'member of mã̄ jhī boatpeople assembly (community)' https://tinyurl.com/y85lflto

Three markhor figurine heads from Harappa. In addition to domestic animals, wild animals such as the markhor (wild goat) are represented in the corpus of Indus figurines. The markhor figurines’ distinctive long spiral horns were formed by wrapping
the clay around a stick or rod while it was wet. Some markhor figurines from Harappa have holes at the bases of finished necks, probably for joining them to a separate body. -- Richard Meadow Approximate dimensions (W x H(L) x D) of the uppermost figurine: 10.9 x 2.9 x 2.9 cm. https://www.harappa.com/figurines/40.html

Anthropomorphs with Indus Script hieroglyphs (as orthographic forms) are dharma saṁjñā, signifiers of corporate metalwork responsibilities of boatmen, the holders of the metal tokens
With the discovery of 31 anthropomorphs in Madarpur, Uttar Pradesh, the total number of such anthropomorphs in India and in Sultanate of Oman has crossed 46 artefacts.
Four of these have been found in Lothal, Haryana, Bihar and Oman. Most artefacts which belong to the prehistoric copper hoard culture dated to earlier than ca. 2nd millennium BCE, have been found in the Ganga-Sarasvati doab.The significance of these anthropomorphs has been debated (See Anthropomorph Bibligraphy appended).

Type IV (Indus Script 'boar' ligature & 'yong bull' hieroglyh inscribed)
Paul Yule had identified TYpe I and Type II artefacts from among the Copper Hoard Culture finds as anthropomorph types based on orthographic features. With the discovery of new artefacts of the Copper Hoard Culture, the typology can now be extended to four types of anthropomorphs. The types are: Type I semi-circular headed, curved arms signifying ram's horns, standing with pread legs; Type II similar to Type I but with Indus script incription of 'fish' hieroglyph; Type III similar to Type I but with variants of 'seated posture' and one right arm lift upwards; and Type IV similar to Type I but with Indus Script inscriptions/ligatures of boar's head and hieroglyph of one-horned young bull.
The findspot of Type II anthropomorph (with 'fish' hieroglyph) is Sheorajpur where an ancient Shiva temple has been discovered. The temple ceiling is decorated with metalwork plates of sculptural friezes attesting to the metalwork tradition of the site during the Bronze Age (See appended note with photographs: About a temple in Sheorajpur with metal ceiling).



13
Apart from the insribed or ligatured anthropomorphs with Indus Script hieroglyphs, the link to Indus Script tradition is validated by the finds of anthropomorphs in Sultanate of Oman dated to ca. 1900 BCe and to the find of an anthropomorph in Lothal (2500 BCE?). Thus, the Copper Hoard Culture can be seen as a continuum of the Bronze Age Revolution evidenced by the Indus Script Corpora of over 7000 inscriptions, all related to metalwork catalogues or data archives.
It is submitted, that the anthropomorphs of Copper Hoard Culture are a reinforcement of the Indus Script decipherent as metalwork cataloguing in Prakrtam (Indian sprachbund), a cipher system mentioned by Vatsyayana as mlecchita vikalpa 'lit.cipher of mleccha/meluhha, 'copper workers'). While many anthropomorph examples are of small size which led Paul Yule to infer that they did not have utilitarian value as 'metal', some examples ahve been reported from Metmuseum of anthropomorphs of sizes 4 1/2 x 3 15/16 in. and 6 1/8 x 4 7/8 in. which have led to their identification as axe-heads or ax celts or copper ingots.
I suggest that all the anthropomorphs are orthographic form hieroglyphs of Indus Script to signify metalwork dharma saṁjñā 'signifiers of resonsibilities (in guild -- as artisans/seafaring merchants) or professional calling cards'.
Such dharma saṁjñā may have been disseminated as badges to herald or proclaim the holders' professional competence in metalwork.
RV 1.10.1 indicates 'worshippers held aloft as it were (on) a pole’ during INdra dhvaja festivals. It is possible that such anthropomorphs were held aloft on poles as exhibits during festivals to proclaim to the people, the new competence in metalwork.

The word, Mendes is read as: mend + ayo (ram + fish) rebus: iron (metal) merchant. Worshipping ancestors, the Mendes might have signified the memory of the metalwork and trade in metalwork of ancestors. See more on Mendes: http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/d/b/dbr3/mendes.htmlExcavations at Tel er-Rub'a (Ancient Mendes)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MendesOn the ram deity of Mendes: 'The chief deities of Mendes were the ram deity Banebdjedet (lit. Ba of the Lord of Djedet), who was the Ba of Osiris, and his consort, the fish goddess Hatmehit. With their child Har-pa-khered ("Horus the Child"), they formed the triad of Mendes. The ram deity of Mendes was described by Herodotus in his
History[1] as being represented with the head and fleece of a goat: “...whereas anyone with a sanctuary of Mendes or who comes from the province of Mendes, will have nothing to do with (sacrificing) goats, but uses sheep as his sacrificial animals... They say that Heracles’ overriding desire was to see Zeus, but Zeus was refusing to let him do so. Eventually, as a result of



18
Heracles’ pleading, Zeus came up with a plan. He skinned a ram and cut off his head, then he
held the head in front of himself, wore the fleece, and showed himself to Heracles like that. That is why the Egyptian statues of Zeus have a ram’s head, is why rams are sacred to the Thebans, and they do not use them as sacrificial animals. However there is just one day of the year—the day of the festival of Zeus--when they chop up a single ram, skin it, dress the statue of Zeus in the way mentioned, and then bring the statue of Heracles up close to the statue of Zeus. Then everyone around the sanctuary mourns the death of the ram and finally they bury it in a sacred tomb.” Presumably following Herodotus' description, the occultist Eliphas Levi in his Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie (1855) called his goat-headed conception of Baphomet the "Baphomet of Mendes"'
Cuneiform text calls the animal a water-ox. ranga ‘buffalo’ rebus: ranga ‘pewter’. िोळ [pōḷa] 'zebu'िोळ [pōḷa] 'magnetite, ferrite ore'

The bull, the rhinoceros and the chikara (perhaps, wild goat or ram) or large Indian antelope(?) depicted on obelisk, Nimrod. (Sir Austen Henry Layard, 1849, Nineveh and its remains: with an account of a visit to the Chaldaean christians of Kurdistan, and the Yezidis, or devil worshippers, and an enquiry into the manners and arts of the ancient Assyrians, Volume 2, J. Murray, p.435) This remarkable depiction of animals from the Indus script glyphs is a remembered legacy from Meluhha trader interactions.
