ABSTRACT
There is a growing need for research to facilitate a better understanding of paedophilia. This study
aims to make a contribution in this regard by providing an analysis of current discourses in
paedophilia research as well as a phenomenological exploration of how the male paedophile
constructs his close relationships with children. Analysis reveals how the dominant positivist
approach to paedophilia research embeds and perpetuates moral and often prejudicial positions that
in turn influence the validity of empirical findings and theory, and tend to marginalise contradictory
evidence. In an attempt to circumvent these obstacles, it is argued that the psychological need to
form close relationships is a universal one. On this basis the central components of close
relationships are presented as a conceptual framework. These components are then applied to an
exploratory phenomenological investigation and analysis of the ways in which three paedophilic
men interpret, understand and construct their relationships with children. Tentative conclusions
include the suggestion that, since there was strong evidence that the participants constructed their
relationships with children in terms of the constructs of close relationships, the framework of close
relationships is useful for separating the psychological needs of paedophiles from ‘deviant sexual
behaviour’. Furthermore, it appears that the framework opens a discursive space in which the
psychological dimensions of paedophilia may be problematised in ways that are less susceptible to
implicit prejudice and bias, and therefore empirically more sound. The implications hereof for
research, theory and psychotherapeutic intervention in the area of paedophilia are discussed briefly.

OPSOMMING
Daar is ’n toenemende behoefte aan navorsing wat tot ’n beter begrip van pedofilie kan lei. Hierdie
studie het ten doel om ’n bydrae in hierdie verband te maak deur ’n analise van huidige diskoerse in
die navorsing van pedofilie, asook ’n fenomenologiese ondersoek na die wyse waarop die manlike
pedofiel sy verhoudings met kinders konstrueer. Analise toon hoe die dominante positivistiese
benadering tot navorsing oor pedofilie morele en dikwels vooroordelende posisies vergestalt en in
stand hou, en hoe dit die geldigheid van empiriese bevindinge en teorie beïnvloed en teenstrydige
bevindinge marginaliseer. In ’n poging om hierdie struikelblokke te omseil, word daar
geargumenteer dat die psigiese behoefte om hegte verhoudings te vorm universeel is. Derhalwe
word die sentrale komponente van hegte verhoudings as ’n konseptuele raamwerk aangebied. Die
komponente word toegepas op ’n eksploratoriese fenomenologiese ondersoek en analise van die
wyses waarop drie pedofiliese mans hulle verhoudings met kinders interpreteer, verstaan en
konstrueer. Tentatiewe gevolgtrekkings sluit onder andere in die aanbeveling dat, na aanleiding van
die sterk indikasies dat deelnemers hulle verhoudings met kinders in terme van komponente van
hegte verhoudings konstrueer, die raamwerk van hegte verhoudings dus nuttig kan wees om die
psigiese behoeftes van pedofiele van ‘afwykende seksuele gedrag’ te onderskei. Verder blyk dit dat
hierdie raamwerk ’n ruimte skep waarin die psigiese dimensies van pedofilie geproblematiseer kan
word, op wyses wat minder neig tot implisiete vooroordeel of sydigheid, en gevolglik empiries
meer gegrond is. Die implikasies vir navorsing, teorie en psigoterapeutiese intervensie in die area
van pedofilie word kortliks bespreek.

1. INTRODUCTION
This study explores the phenomenon of paedophilia. It investigates the construction of the
relationship between the male paedophile and a child, focusing on historical and contemporary
views and discourses, and highlighting the tensions between these. A phenomenological exploration
will be presented of the ways in which the male paedophile (who does not use violence or physical
force) experiences and understands his relationship with a child.
The word paedophilia is derived from the Greek words paido and fileo – meaning child and love
(Engelbrecht, 1989). Historically, this word was used to indicate the loving feelings an adult may
have for a child. These loving feelings were not limited to emotions but included sexual desire for a
child. It will be shown that, until fairly recently, paedophilia was not perceived as immoral.
Constantine first condemned paedophilia on moral grounds in 325 A.D. The concepts of ‘sexual
abuse of children’ and ‘child molester’ came into existence then and are still here today
(Engelbrecht, 1989).
On a societal level, paedophilia has been defined as immoral and monstrous (Ivey & Simpson,
1998). In South Africa, the paedophile is seen as a “social pariah, the extreme embodiment of
deviant sexuality” (Ivey & Simpson, 1998, p. 15). It is especially in the last two decades (Rind,
Bauserman, & Tromovich, 1998) that the social status of the paedophile has become even more
demonised, to that of a “filthy pervert” who “abducts” and “murders” children (Kempe & Kempe,
1984). This is often the picture portrayed and reinforced by the media (Levine, 1995). As Ivey and
Simpson (1998) point out, much of what is popularly believed about paedophiles is not true, and is
the result of a socio-cultural process of demonisation, often fuelled by biased research findings
(Howitt, 1995; Mirkin, 1999; Rind, Bauserman, & Tromovich, 2000).
Empirically, paedophilia is a problematic construct to define. Today, it is listed in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV-TR (DSM-IV-TR), the modernist charter of
psychological disorders. According to the medical model, which is inherently positivist, paedophilia
is seen and defined as a psychopathology – an illness. The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000) classifies paedophilia as a sexual disorder under the category of paraphilia,
while the ICD-10 (Kaplan & Sadock, 1998) classifies paedophilia as a disorder of sexual
orientation. Sexual disorders are thought to interrupt the major functions of sexual behaviour (the
enhancement and expression of love, bonding and procreation) and are seen as deviant behaviour



10
(Kaplan & Sadock, 1998). According to the positivist view, paedophilic acts are seen as perversions
of ‘normal’ sexuality.
This classification system rests to a large extent on a body of academic literature on paedophilia
that is almost exclusively positivist in nature, although alternative approaches do exist. Within this
paradigm, two parallel, yet overlapping, aspects emerge. One explains paedophilia in terms of
psychopathology, the other in terms of its illegality. Positivist research on paedophilia has thus
focused predominantly on its criminal and psychopathological dimensions.
The rational-instrumental underpinning of positivism has thus far served to contain paedophilia in
the interests of maintaining social order. However, as will be shown below, this paradigm has
limited usefulness in furthering understanding of paedophilia, since it operates from an inherently
biased moral position. This paper will argue that the positivist view of paedophilia in fact contains
crucial value judgements regarding paedophilia, which are disguised as ‘scientific findings’ and
which trap the concept of paedophilia in moral and political agendas (Green, 2002; Mirkin, 1999;
Schmidt, 2002). The argument then follows that when these assumptions and judgements remain
hidden, positivist research on paedophilia tacitly supports and reinforces the existing social and
legal order, in which paedophilia is classified as pathological and paedophiles are demonised and
criminalised.
Apart from providing an analysis of contemporary theories on paedophilia, this study will provide
an alternative framework for understanding paedophilia. This is in line with the call for research
that approaches paedophilia from the perspective of the paedophile without a priori moral
judgement or condemnation (Green, 2002; Levett, 2004; Moser, 2001; Schmidt, 2002). Numerous
psychotherapists working with paedophiles have also expressed a need for a more rational and
compassionate approach towards paedophilia (Gieles, 2001; Moser, 2001; Van Lessen, 1990) and
have adopted a more supportive approach to paedophiles in their therapeutic work (Kear-Colwell &
Boer, 2000; Van Lessen, 1990).
In keeping with social constructionist theory, this study acknowledges that choosing a specific
definition of paedophilia is in itself a political act. As such, I will not attempt to provide an absolute
definition of paedophilia, but will rather highlight the contradiction between the historical and
contemporary modes of defining this construct, and give promenance to moral judgements implicit
in the current theory.



11
In order to substantiate the need for alternative constructs in the generation of theory on paedophilia,
the following steps will be taken: firstly, the historical view of paedophilia will be presented,
highlighting its socially constructed nature; secondly, the positivist perspective of paedophilia will
be analysed in terms of its limitations and intrinsic contradictions; and thirdly, the influence that the
positivist perspective has had on research, therapeutic intervention and theoretical models of
paedophilia will be described. This process will substantiate the manner in which the positivist
paradigm has shaped the discourses of paedophilia and the ways in which it has influenced our
understanding of the phenomenon. Proceeding from this basis, an alternative conceptual framework,
namely of close relationships, will be outlined.
The need to form and maintain close relationships may be construed as a universal human need, in
that these relationships are a primary source of fulfilment, happiness and satisfaction with life
(Campbell, Converse, & Rodgers, 1976; Freedman, 1978; Myers & Diener, 1995; Seligman, 2002).
The notion of close relationship offers a useful universal container for a range of related constructs
relevant to intimate interpersonal relationships that may be present in paedophilic relationships.
Furthermore, as sexuality is often expressed most clearly within a close relationship (McKinny &
Sprecher, 1991), the notion of close relationships provides a valuable framework for studying
sexuality in general, and thus paedosexuality. It will be argued that the close relationship
framework to a large extent circumvents the moral bias inherent in positivist models, thereby
creating new spaces for problematising the phenomenon and new avenues for research and
intervention. Lastly, the usefulness of this framework will be tested by applying it to the
phenomenological data gathered from three paedophiles and by discussing emergent implications.
While this study challenges current conceptualisations of paedophilia, it should not be construed as
an approval of adult-child sexual relations. Rather, the intention is to illustrate how current theory
has been constrictive to our understanding of the phenomenon, and to open up a discursive space in
which new ways of understanding paedophilia can be explored.

2. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
2.1. Introduction
The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of how paedophilia has been viewed
historically, to highlight the fact that a change has taken place in the hegemonic conceptualisation
of paedophilia over time, and to emphasise the socially constructed nature of this phenomenon.
2.2. Historical notions of paedophilia
In Ancient Greece and Rome, a sexual relationship between an older man and a boy was conceived
as normal, rather than being deviant. To the Greeks, pederasty was an important element in raising
male youth (Licht, 1953). Pederast marriages and honeymoons were common in Crete and Boeotia,
and ‘rent-a-boy’ services were available in Athens (De Mause, 1974). Young Romans soon
followed the local customs while studying in Athens and Rhodes. The presence of boys also
became a common feature in the Roman army. At the end of the first century B.C. it had become
common practice for a centurion to have a boy accompanying him wherever he went for the
purpose of a constant sexual relationship: this led to the custom of ‘tent-sharers’ in the Roman army.
De Mause (1974) labelled Greek and Roman men ‘ambisexual’ in their inclinations and practices,
since their sexual attraction was to both women and children and they could not be referred to as
homosexual or bisexual. He reports that in the passage from childhood dependence to adult
responsibilities, the sexual and moral guidance of a caring man was seen as invaluable.
The idea of pederasty as an approved phase in the development of the male is not unique to ancient
Greece or Rome; it is found in its most extreme form among the Sambian people of New Guinea
(Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, 1991). It was believed that a young man who did not engage in sexual
activities with an older man would remain a child, never to become a warrior. They further believed
that by ingesting the semen of an older man, a boy would grow to be self-confident and masculine.
More cross-cultural examples of adult-child sex include the people of the Siwa Valley in North
Africa and the people of Aranda in Central Australia, where most men and boys engaged in anal
intercourse (Ford & Beach, 1951). Diamond (1990) reviewed adult-child sex in Hawaiian and
Polynesian history. During the eighteenth century in Hawaii sexual interactions between adult and
child were seen as benefiting the child, rather than as gratifying the adult. The sexual desire by an



13
adult for a non-adult, heterosexual or homosexual was also accepted (Pukui, Haertig, & Lee, quoted
in Diamond, 1990). The same occurred in Polynesia (Diamond, 1990).
Ancient religious law also acknowledged sex between men and very young girls. The Jewish
Talmud allowed that a girl over 3 years of age may, with her father’s permission, be engaged to a
man by sexual intercourse (Rush, 1980). Sex with a girl younger than three would not be illegal, but
invalid for the purpose of engagement. In ancient Christian tradition this age was 7 years (Rush,
1980).
For three hundred years, up until the 20th century, the age of sexual consent in England was 10
(Green, 2002). The decision to increase the age of sexual consent in England was encouraged by
concerns regarding child prostitution, not by concerns regarding paedophilia.
Historically, the concept realisation of paedophilia as a pathological condition or criminal behaviour
pattern did not exist. Rather, adult-child sexual activities often served cultural, moral-religious and
spiritual-ritualistic purposes (Radbill, 1980). Therefore, in many contexts over time, these practices
were also socially condoned. The terms perpetrator and victim were non-existent. There were only
men, and the term passives were used for boys indulging in sexual activities with men.
Men continued to use children as sexual objects, largely without reservation or fear of social
sanction, up until the 1800s (Schultz, 1980). From that time an argument was made that children
needed protection from their ‘own sexual instincts’ as they were ‘sexually dangerous’, and needed
adults to enforce asexuality and innocence (Schultz, 1980). Since then society has moved from
denying the sexual exploitation of children to gradually recognising child rights (Kilpatrick, 1992).
Paedophilia as a harmful adult-child sexual practice is therefore a conceptual construct that emerged
with the growing influence of the Christian religion (Engelbrecht, 1989) and the emergence of child
rights (Jackson, Karlson, & Tseng, 1991). Children only recently became a focus of protection and
seen as deserving of their own rights. In South Africa, for example, the Child and Family Welfare
Society only started its operations in helping victims of child abuse in 1918 (Snyman, quoted in
Schurink, 1992).
In the 1940s and 1950s, more awareness of child welfare and child rights increased as the fields of
child psychology and social work gained prominence. Also, more advanced social programmes for
children could now be created. With the arrival of television, the media heightened public



14
awareness of child abuse in the 1960s. It was also in the 1960s that child sexual abuse became a
distinct focus of academic study. A landmark for research in child abuse, which received great
publicity, was the study in 1962 by Kempe, The battered child syndrome (Bullough, 1990). This
resulted in even more societal awareness of child abuse and the need for appropriate legislation.
Consequently, government funding in America increased specifically for research of child sexual
abuse (Jackson et al., 1991). Paedophilia has since been condemned on moral grounds, and the
terms child sexual abuse and child molester, perpetrator and victim were firmly established in the
language of adult-child sexual relations (Engelbrecht, 1989).
It is overly simplistic to assume that paedophilia was uniformly and unquestioningly accepted in
pre-modernist times. These activities were mostly practiced by adult men in a patriarchal society
and they controlled the narratives and discourses surrounding adult-child sexual relations, positing
these as normal and commonplace, even beneficial to the child. Kilpatrick (1992) points out that
children and females were seen as having few or no human attributes and were mainly regarded as
property of the male, to be dealt with as he saw fit.
2.3. Conclusion
Two central points were made in this section. Firstly, the meaning of adult-child relations has
changed over time and context, thus illustrating the socially constructed nature of this phenomenon.
Secondly, dominant groups in society have been responsible for defining and therefore controlling
the conceptualisation of adult-child sex. In pre-modernist societies, which were strongly patriarchal,
it was men who had the power to define paedophilia (although they did not use this term). In our
contemporary society, by contrast, science (that until recently has been a predominantly male
domain) has defined and classified paedophilia.

3. CONTEMPORARY EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO PAEDOPHILIA
3.1. Introduction
The aim of this section is to locate paedophilia within contemporary research and theoretical
paradigms. The chapter will start with a discussion of positivism and recent changes regarding this
paradigm. This will be followed by an explication of research that has been conducted on
paedophilia, focusing on theories and therapies that have been developed to contain it. Finally, this
chapter will present paedophilia in terms of psychological aspects of its criminality.
3.2. Historical view on positivism
In order to understand the current position that paedophilia occupies within contemporary research
paradigms, it is necessary to look at the historical position of positivism within scientific research,
as well as to review recent changes that have influenced this paradigm. Positivism, which has
historically been a dominant factor in all scientific research, including psychological research, is
built on three assumptions: logical empiricism, rationality and objectivity (Babbie, 1998).
Positivism holds that science is based on the results of experimentation and observation; scientific
theory is an abstract representation of a phenomenon; and that good theory, therefore, is a mirror of
reality. Positivism also assumes the belief that it is possible to describe any experience in value
neutral language, and that an objective reality exists to which all humans have access (Davis &
Stasz, 1990).
However, in recent decades dissenting voices from within various disciplines have begun to
question even the most axiomatic assumptions that positivism is built upon (Lash, 1990; Stein,
1998). Theorists such as Popper (1963) and Kuhn (1962) have argued convincingly that research is
and remains a human endeavour, that it cannot be removed from the social context in which it
operates and that it is fundamentally shaped by the dominant institutions and discourses in society.
Kuhn (1962), specifically, deconstructed the notion that science is a rational, objective endeavour
freed from human passion and error.
Feminist theorists (De Beauvior, 1977; Fraser, 1987; Young, 1987) have, in similar fashion,
uncloaked the strong influence that institutions such as patriarchy have had (and still have) on



16
science, and in the process have questioned the concept of a rational, objective observer who can
conduct research from an ahistoric, uninvolved position. Feminist theory has in large measure been
responsible for the notion that a researcher cannot and should not attempt to conduct research
without first acknowledging his or her values, assumptions and social attributes. Finally, advances
within linguistic theory have led to the post-structuralist movement and meta-theories such as social
constructionism, wherein the very notion that language can be neutral is radically deconstructed
(Lash, 1990).
It can be argued that there has been a definite, broad movement in theoretical fields that has started
to spill over into research and particular methodologies, affecting the way that research is
conceptualised and carried out. Specifically, researchers have begun to recognise the importance of
acknowledging their own values and assumptions, and to move away from attempting to conduct
‘value-free’ research. This study aims to align itself with this broad movement, and will attempt to
apply these new theories and concepts to the research on paedophilia.
3.3. Position of paedophilia within contemporary research paradigms
In recent years, the phenomenon of paedophilia has held a central position in psychological debates.
Two major issues that have been contested are whether paedophilia genuinely causes harm and
whether it is indeed a pathological condition. As stated earlier, paedophilia is defined as a disorder
in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10. Definitions of paedophilia as pathological rely on assumptions
of behaviour that is deemed deviant. Subsequent attempts to generate explicatory theory should
therefore serve to support this label.
However, it is in fact the assumption that paedophilia is a mental disorder that has been contested
by researchers such as Green (2002) and Schmidt (2002). Although both researchers received harsh
criticism, they also enjoyed the support of fellow colleagues and researchers. Subsequently,
paedophilia was one of the ‘disorders’ discussed at the annual American Psychiatric Association
(APA) convention in May 2003 (Lawrence, 2003). The discussion centred on the possible removal
of paedophilia from the DSM. Although paedophilia was not removed, the definition of paedophilia
was changed in the Text Revision of the DSM-IV. The DSM-IV-TR now states that only an adult
that acts on his or her paedophilic urges qualifies for a diagnosis of the disorder (Lawrence, 2003).



17
Another controversial event in the study of paedophilia was a paper published in the Psychological
Bulletin by the APA in 1998, presenting the findings of researchers Rind, Bauserman and
Tromovich. The authors argued that not all instances of sex between adults and children cause
psychological harm to children. Coming from the APA, this article could be seen as a major
breakthrough regarding paedosexual politics. However, the APA and the authors of the above
mentioned article have since been subjected to harsh criticism and disapproval (Ruark, 1999), to the
extent that the APA issued a statement (APA, 1999) proclaiming their condemnation of child sexual
abuse, and stating that it remains morally wrong. This statement of course highlights the implicit
moral viewpoint that is held with regards to this ‘scientific’ topic, yet it does not go beyond this
viewpoint to acknowledge that positivist research is informed by these moral assumptions.
The latter is exactly the point Rind et al. (1998) make in their articles: not that child sexual abuse is
harmless, but rather that morality and non-scientific assumptions are arresting scientific
development. In a later article they state “we need to recognise and counter non-scientific advocacy
in the social sciences” (Rind, Bauserman, & Tromovich, 2000, p. 211). They further explicitly point
out the distinction between wrongfulness, a moral/legal view on abuse, and harmfulness, which is a
scientific definition of abuse. These two terms have implicitly and erroneously been used in
academic literature as interchangeable terms, thus confusing morality and law with science (Ruark,
1999).
Even though the Rind studies (Bauserman & Rind, 1997; Rind et al., 1998) were supported by other
researchers and academics (Mirkin, undated; Bullough, 2000; Oellerich, 2000), the strong emotive
reaction arrested the contribution it made to the research of child sexual abuse. The articles
especially held valuable contributions for therapists working with paedophiles and children who
have experienced adult-child relations (Bullough, 2000), as it challenged assumptions regarding
child sexual abuse and the treatment thereof. According to Mirkin (undated), the intense
controversy was due to the challenge the Rind articles posed to the empirical foundations of moral
claims made about child sexual abuse. It broke the rules of sexual politics and as a result, the value
of the research could not be appreciated.
In agreement with Moser (2001), it is my contention that the attacks levelled at the researchers have
strongly impeded similar research within this arena. This study aims to encourage further research
on the phenomenon of paedophilia. A central point of this study is to acknowledge and answer to
the intrinsic problems in studying paedophilia, by analysing where unacknowledged moral and legal
constructs have taken possession of so-called scientific enquiry, and how this has impacted our



18
understanding of this phenomenon. However, it is first necessary to locate paedophilia within
current and contemporary research approaches and academic literature.
3.4. Research on paedophilia
There is ample literature on paedophilia that is informed by a positivist research paradigm. Within
this paradigm, two parallel yet overlapping approaches emerge. The one approach explains
paedophilia in terms of psychopathology, the other in terms of its illegality. These two pathways are
often fused in positivist research and literature and together they contain most essential positivist
assumptions held on paedophilia: that it is an illness, it is morally wrong and it causes harm to
society. These two approaches will be discussed in this chapter by presenting literature and research
findings on both categories. Alternative contemporary approaches towards paedophilia will also be
discussed. This chapter will furthermore highlight the limitations contemporary approaches (in
particular the positivist approach) place on the research of paedophilia; the boundaries it places on
therapeutic interventions; and ultimately the extent to which it impedes a fuller understanding of
this phenomenon.
3. 4. 1. Paedophilia as a pathological condition
3.4.1.1. Theories on paedophilia: the positivist perspective
Several theories built on radically divergent foundations have been proposed to explain paedophilia
(Howitt, 1995). Since paedophiles appear to constitute a heterogeneous group (Greenberg, 1990), it
may well be impossible for one single theory to be applied to all paedophiles. A few of the most
influential theories will be presented below, focusing also on their limitations. The theories have
been divided into two groups: those embedded in the positivist paradigm (including social learning
theories, cognitive theories and biological theories) and alternative (non-positivist) approaches
towards paedophilia (such as psychoanalytic theories, feminist and post-feminist theories, as well as
the phenomenological approach).
Howells (1981) framed paedophilia as a sexual learning process. The central hypothesis is that
children engage in various forms of sexual activity during childhood. The association of sexual
arousal with immature body characteristics of other children may condition a long-term sexual
response to immature bodies. However, this theory fails to explain why many people pass through
their childhood with childhood sexual experiences without becoming adult paedophiles – an



19
argument that effectively undermines this theory and suggests the presence of other significant
variables.
The precondition model (Araji & Finkelhor, 1986) categorises factors that characterise paedophiles
and the circumstances leading to offending into four basic types. These types could also be named
‘motivating factors’ in sexual attraction to children. The possibility of an interaction of two or more
of these factors, as motivational force, is proposed:
1. Emotional congruence – the paedophile’s emotional need to relate to children. He seeks to
have this emotional need met by engaging in sexual activity with children.
2. Sexual arousal – children are sexually arousing to the paedophile.
3. Blockage – factors responsible for the unavailability of adult sexual and emotional
gratification. The appropriate means of fulfilling these needs are unavailable or less
attractive.
4. Disinhibition – factors responsible for the disregard of normal prohibitions against sex with
children. The usual inhibitions regarding sex with children are overcome.
The precondition model is one of the most widely acknowledged and accepted explanations of
paedophilia. However, much of the evidence used for this model is weak or lacks methodological
integrity (Okami, 1990) and comes from highly biased samples, nearly always consisting of
offender populations (Kilpatrick, 1987; Okami, 1990). It has been argued that the characteristics
found in the paedophiles from these populations may be related to the arrestation process and the
treatment they endure from other prisoners (Howitt, 1995).
The cognitive distortion theory argues that paedophiles use whatever cognitive means they can to
validate their activities (Wyre, 1990). Some of the characteristic cognitive styles of paedophiles are:
1. Minimalising their offence.
2. Redefining the abuse as something consensual and desired by the child.
3. Excusing their offence by attributing blame to external factors, such as family break-up and
unemployment or by blaming the child.
Approaches such as the cognitive distortion theory rest on a moral and ideological basis in that it
assumes a type of conscious mental manipulation of reality on the part of the paedophile that is both
self-serving and self-exculpatory. For example, if a paedophile should refer to the sexual activity he
enjoyed with a child as ‘a game’, it could be labelled ‘redefining the abuse as something desired by



20
the child’ and ‘minimising the offence’. Such approaches, however, often have little basis in
systemic research and theory (Howitt, 1995).
The last positivist theory on paedophilia discussed here is that of physiological disposition.
Langevin, Wortzman, Dickey, Wright and Handy (quoted in Freund, 1994) used CAT (computer
assisted tomography) to detect structural anomalies of paedophiles’ brains. A similar study was
conducted by Wright, Nobrega, Langevin and Wortzman (1990). They proposed that structural
abnormalities are more common in the brains of sexual offenders than in the brains of control
groups, thus implying a biological basis to paedophilic tendencies. However, Lang, Flor-Henry and
Frenzel (quoted in Howitt, 1995) reviewed research on the sex hormone profiles of paedophiles and
incestuous people, but found no clear hormonal profile. They strongly discredited this theory.
3.4.1.2. Theories from non-positivist approaches
From a psychodynamic perspective, paedophilia has traditionally been viewed as a perversion
(Socarides, 1991; Storr, 1964). Scruton (1986) regards perversion as the sexual interest in a less
than fully regarded partner. As such, the love object is wanted in diminished form. Referring to
paedophilia, the child is wanted, because he or she is a child (less than an adult), not in spite of
being a child. According to Scruton (1986), a child could be seen as a prelude to a person: a person
in diminished form, a less than fully regarded partner. However, this general definition of a
perversion could indicate that even masturbation should be seen as a perversion, since it does not
include any form of a partner, but only the fantasy thereof. Overall, assumptions of perversion have
not withstood sociological or psychological review. It became apparent from the studies conducted
by Kinsey (Kinsey, Pomeroy, & Martin, 1948; Kinsey, Pomeroy, Martin, & Gebhard, 1953) that
many socially condemned sexual activities are very common. Expressions of sexuality have since
been difficult to define as perversion.
Most feminist theories argue that boys and men generally learn to experience their sexuality as an
overwhelming and uncontrollable force that has to be expressed and that they focus their sexual
feelings on submissive objects (Howitt, 1995). The feminist view of child sexual abuse developed
from an earlier focus on family violence and sexual violence against women. The feminist principle
is that interpersonal relationships involve power relationships that transform the private realm into a
political one, thus making sexual politics an integral part of male-female and adult-child
interactions (Dominelli, 1989). The political undertone of feminist discourse on adult-child sexual
relations is even more evident in post-modern feminism. For example, the post-modern feminist
approach to sexuality sees sexuality as constructed in relation to, and in interaction with, historically



21
and culturally available social practices such as religion, education and medicine (Harding, 1990).
As a result, some sexual experiences, beliefs and practises are legitimised and others are denigrated
or remain hidden (Harding, 1990). Post-modern feminism acknowledges in-group diversity and
gives attention to the multiplicity of experiences and understandings that may exist within one
group. This approach leads to the concept of sexualities, acknowledging different experiences and
meanings of sexuality, rather than one ‘sexuality’ (Barber & Allen, 1992). Consequently, this
approach considers the experiences of those whose sexuality have been ignored or misinterpreted.
However, post-modern feminists also take the position that all claims of truth do not carry the same
justificatory force (Barber & Allen, 1992). They assert that critical reflection and rational argument
should be used to illuminate problems in social relations and to identify inaccuracies in opposing
perspectives (Hawkesworth, 1989). Adult-child sexual relations are therefore not considered by
post-modern feminists as a sexuality that has been misinterpreted. Adult-child sexual relations are
seen as replicating the oppressive power relations of patriarchy. Specifically, sexual relations
entailing an adult male and underaged female are viewed as a medium for the victimisation of
women. This position concludes that the young female might be emotionally or materially
dependent on the adult and is therefore exploitable. Man-boy sexual relations are also typified as
paradigmatic of patriarchy, as the dominant/submissive power dynamic is also present in such a
relationship (LeMoncheck, 1997).
On this basis, post-modern feminists conclude that they oppose adult-child sexual contact, even if
the child does consent (Barber & Murray, 2001). From this perspective, one can argue that feminist
discourse on sexual offending against children seems to have a political dimension that is similar in
nature, although contradictory in intent, to the attempts by paedophile organisations to normalise
paedophiliac activity (Howitt, 1995). They have demonised patriarchy, and by implication, also
paedophilia. The danger here is that ‘critical reflection’ and ‘rational argument’ seem to become
substitutes for moral and social condemnation. If this should be the case, the post-modern feminist
approach to sexuality seems to diverge quite radically from the stated position of giving voice to
those individuals whose sexuality has been ignored.
A South African study by Ivey and Simpson (1998) represents a phenomenological approach to
paedophilia. These authors explored the subjective meaning of the paedophilic experience by
conducting qualitative open-ended interviews with 6 paedophiles. The study emphasised that
paedophilic behaviour originates from a range of non-sexual motives related to unmet childhood
needs for parental affection and affirmation. Their psychological profile of a male paedophile



22
included the following: he is emotionally still a child, and feels inadequate (socially and sexually)
to negotiate in an adult world. They concluded that the paedophile feels accepted, in control and
more adequate in his relations with children, which compensates for the rejection he experiences in
adult relations (Ivey & Simpson, 1998). This approach challenged traditional stereotypes of the
‘child molester’ and provided a new perspective on paedophilia. However, the study was still
embedded in the positivist assumption that paedophilia is a pathological condition. In their
conclusion, paedophilic behaviour was described as “deviant sexual strategies that some individuals
employ to avoid psychic pain” (Ivey & Simpson, 1998, p. 19).
The theories on the pathology of paedophilia presented in this section have included positivist
approaches of sexual learning, preconditioning, cognitive distortion, biological abnormality and
alternative approaches to paedophilia, including sexual perversion, oppressive power relations and
the phenomenological approach. However, not one of these theories manages to fully explain the
phenomenon of paedophilia. Three fundamental problems that limit the validity of these theories
were identified and will now be summarised.
Firstly, no single theory could explain all manifestations of paedophilia. As explained earlier,
paedophiles comprise a heterogeneous population and, subsequently, this phenomenon demands a
heterogeneous set of theories (Howitt, 1995). The phenomenon is too complex to be explained from
within merely one theoretical model. Present theories and explanations of paedophilia are based on
extreme and divergent theoretical foundations and these theories vary across historical, sociological,
biological, psychological and even political domains. Some theorists argue that it is the
heterogeneous nature of the paedophile population itself that is the reason for these greatly
divergent foundations (Howitt, 1995).
Secondly, as was pointed out, each theory has fundamental empirical or theoretical issues
undermining its validity. For instance, none of the mentioned theories can lay claim to a sound
empirical basis, as research evidence that ‘supports’ these theories is often inconsistent,
contradictory or lacks methodological integrity (Howitt, 1995; Okami, 1990). Thirdly, all of the
above theories conceptualise paedophilia as pathological. As such, these theories share the same
positivist assumption of paedophilia, namely that paedophilia is an illness and morally wrong. It is
proposed, moreover, that this assumption might be the factor creating the inaccuracy of all these
theories (Howitt, 1995). The next section of this chapter will discuss the therapies that have flowed
from these theoretical conceptualisations of paedophilia.



23
3.4.1.3. Psychotherapeutic approaches
As different theories of paedophilia evolved, different therapies were adopted for ‘treating’
paedophilia. According to Howitt (1995), therapeutic intervention has struggled to yield long-term
positive results. Some theorists (Cossins, 2000; Howitt, 1995; Okami, 1990) interpret this as proof
that there is an inherent weakness connecting all contemporary conceptualisations of paedophilia.
The current most popular therapies are multifaceted programmes that cover deficits in the
knowledge, skills and thinking of offenders. There is, however, a lack in research specifying which
parts of the programmes work best. It is also not clear why these social programmes have to
dominate therapy when the level of programme effectiveness (and therefore also cost effectiveness)
is in question (Howitt, 1995). Two major problems raised in conventional treatment programmes
for paedophiles are:
1. They are almost invariably designed for prisoner or psychiatric hospital populations (Howitt,
1995).
2. They are designed for all sex offenders (Howitt, 1995), for instance they are aimed at rapists,
general sexual offenders and paedophiles, while no empirical evidence exists that suggests
similarity between these groups.
In the 1960s, depth therapy was used to search for the fermenting psychological conflict causing the
‘paedophilic symptoms’ (Howitt, 1995). Behaviour therapy employed psychological techniques that
promoted the unlearning of learnt paedophilic behaviour. Much of the early behaviour therapy
treatments for paedophilia emerged from earlier attempts to convert gay men and lesbians into
‘normal persons’ (Doyle, 1992).
The most popular modern therapy – cognitive-behaviour therapy – entails the dismantling of self
justifications, attitudes and beliefs of the paedophile, while including more behavioural-orientated
strategies aimed at stopping the paedophilic behaviour (Barbaree, Bogaert, & Seto, 1995).
Although therapy for paedophiles has evolved since depth therapy, it still remains largely
underpinned by a theoretical and ideological framework that defines paedophilia as a disease.
A small number of therapists have adopted a position that is more supportive of paedophiles (Van
Lessen, 1990). These supportive therapies help paedophiles to understand the emotional functions



24
of paedophilia. Kear-Colwell and Boer (2000) are in support of such an empathic approach. They
believe that paedophilia is a description of particular sexual interest and behaviour, rather than a
mental disorder. They also believe that it is the therapist’s role to try to understand why an adult
prefers a child as a sexual partner and to help the adult develop skills to deal with his thoughts and
feelings that could lead to further paedophilic behaviour. Kear-Colwell and Boer (2000) have noted
that present approaches to treatment of the paedophile are not as effective as they should be. They
found that confrontation during treatment could be counter-, if not anti-therapeutic, and that other
more empathic and supportive approaches are needed, at least in the beginning of the treatment
process.
Kear-Colwell and Boer (2000) acknowledge the influence of socio-political constructs that surround
and distort therapists’ perceptions, decision making and practice. However, they suggest that
therapists deal with their clients as individuals with profound difficulties, and not as representative
of a class of criminals. This suggested approach could lead to the development of a therapeutic
alliance that may serve as a template for the development of a healthy attachment to a caregiving
adult. The therapeutic alliance could be a very important learning experience for the paedophile in
terms of trusting and relating to adults. According to Kear-Colwell and Boer (2000), a significant
shift is also needed toward helping the paedophile understand his history and how that history has
influenced his life to date, as well as his emotional and cognitive vulnerabilities and his emotional
attraction to children.
In supportive treatment, the potential conflict between the needs of the client and the protection of
society poses a problem for the therapist (Kear-Colwell, 1996). The therapist would therefore need
to think through the issues that are involved, to be clear about his or her own position and to discuss
this with the client. It is a matter of dealing openly with the paedophilic client, as one human being
to another, and developing a mutual rapport that becomes an effective alliance for successful
treatment. It is therefore proposed that the paedophile’s problems be addressed in a more holistic
manner, as opposed to simply treating the offending behaviour as the only issue and ignoring the
person who generated the behaviour (Kear-Colwell & Boer, 2000).
Although supportive therapies might provide useful guidelines, there is a great need for more
research in this area, as little is available to evaluate or support this therapeutic approach. Overall,
paedophiles continue to be demonised by society and any research that would enhance
understanding and treatment consequently remains vital (Moser, 2001).



25
3.4.2. Paedophilia as a criminal act: typology
The second approach of positivist research concerning paedophiles focuses on paedophilia as a
criminal act. The main purpose for such research is to identify a child molester in order to
apprehend possible offenders and contribute to their conviction. Two major typologies of sexual
abuse offenders are Groth’s (1978, 1982) typology of male offenders and Mathews’s (1987)
typology of female sexual offenders. The foundation of these approaches also includes the
conceptualisation of paedophilia as pathology. Child molester is the term given to the paedophile
that transgresses the law by engaging in sexual activities with children – a term that contributes to
the homogenous categorisation of paedophiles and emphasises the predatory quality that is
commonly attributed to them.
The DSM-IV-TR distinguishes paraphilias primarily on the basis of the structure of the
inappropriate stimulus or situation. Behavioural scientists have devised additional structural
subtypologies in an attempt to refine the DSM category of paedophilia. Extensive research has been
done to compile a profile of the typical paedophile (Adams & McNaulty, 1994; Anderson & Kunce,
1979; Duthie & McIvor, 1990; Grobbelaar, Snyman, & Steyn, 1995; Guddjonsson & Sigurdsson,
2000; Murray, 2000). Social inadequacies of the offender (Knight, Carter, & Prentky, 1989), the
presence of antisocial tendencies (Fitch, 1962), and the degree of entrenchment of fixation of the
behaviour (Groth, 1979; Knight et al., 1989) have all been suggested as helpful distinctions between
different child molesters. Other studies sought to identify personality traits of the paedophile (Ching
& Yanagida, 1995; Dean, Joy, Miller, & Ridenour, 1997; Henderson & Kalichman, 1991; Maric &
Marshall, 1996), using different psychometric measuring instruments. For example, Ames and
Houston (1990) reported that 77 members of a paedophilia self-help club presented themselves on
the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire as introverted, shy, sensitive and depressed. They also found
paedophiles to be more fearful of negative evaluations, unassertive, socially inept, and overly
sensitive compared to other groups.
Many similar studies have been conducted, but the utility and validity of popular psychometric
measuring instruments used on paedophiles are being questioned (Chantry & Craig, 1994). The
Milton Clinical Multiaxial Personality Inventory (MCMI), for example, measures enduring
personality disposition, which would not be susceptible to situational variables, whereas clinical
states, such as anxiety and depression, would be affected by such variables. Therefore, it cannot be
determined whether the personality styles found in convicted paedophiles are pre-existing, or
whether the results are a reaction to their incarceration (Chantry & Craig, 1994).



26
The classification of paedophiles developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is an
example of structural typology and was developed to assist the police in criminal cases. Lanning
(quoted in Academy of Investigation, 2001) of the FBI differentiates between two types of child
molesters: the situational molester and the preferential child molester.
The situational child molester does not have a true sexual preference for children, but engages in
sex with children for some other reason. There are four types of situational child molesters:
1. The regressed child molester has low self-esteem and poor coping skills and uses children
because of the unavailability of suitable peers.
2. The morally indiscriminate child molester has antisocial personality traits. The sexual abuse
of children is a continuation of a general pattern of abuse in his life.
3. The sexually indiscriminate child molester wants to experiment with sex. He does not have
an exclusive preference for children, but experiments with them, as he would experiment
with sadomasochism and homosexualism.
4. The inadequate child molester suffers from psychoses, personality disorders, mental
retardation or senility. He is typically withdrawn and does not have the confidence to
approach adult partners.
The preferential child molester is the second type of child molester and prefers children as sexual
partners to adults. There are three types of preferential child molesters:
1. The seductive child molester will court the children, like an adult would court his partner,
with attention, affection and gifts.
2. The introverted child molester has a sexual preference for children, but lacks the
interpersonal skills to seduce them. He usually molests strangers or very young children.
3. The sadistic child molester has a sexual preference for children, but needs to inflict and see
pain before he is aroused. He might murder his victims.
Typology models contribute to the understanding of the motivations of child sex offenders, but fall
prey to attempting to fit the offence into an existing theoretical perspective, rather than generating
an explanatory model from data concerning the phenomenon itself (Hollin, 1989). There is a need
for the establishment of a psychological profile of a paedophile, especially in juridical systems
(Murphy & Peters, 1992). To date there is still no agreed psychological profile of a paedophile and
a reliable profile has not yet been identified (Bancroft, 1989; Becker & Quinsey, 1993; Conte, 1991;



27
Ivey & Simpson, 1998). This is a probable result of paedophiles comprising a heterogeneous
population (Bancroft, 1989; Barnard, Fuller, Robbins, & Shaw, 1989; Glasner & Frosh, 1998; Ivey
& Simpson, 1998; Renvoize, 1993).
3.5. Conclusion
Two dominant research perspectives on paedophilia, namely that of pathology and criminality, both
primarily embedded in the positivist view, have been discussed in this section. It has been
highlighted that both these perspectives fall prey to criticism of inconsistency and lack of
sustainable research evidence (Hollin, 1989; Howitt, 1995). An essential problem with these views
seems to be the fact that paedophiles comprise of a heterogeneous population, an issue that these
theories fail to capture adequately. One could even go so far as to say that, in dealing with
paedophilia, not one theory, classification system or therapeutic programme might ever be adequate
to fully explain this phenomenon. Finally, the root problem embedded in these two parallel
positivist approaches seems to be the unacknowledged and hence unquestioned assumption that
paedophilia is a pathological condition. The following section will address the influence the
positivist approach has had on the classification, categorisation and ultimately society’s
understanding of paedophilia.

4. THE INFLUENCE OF POSITIVISM ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF
PAEDOPHILIA
“To bring about significant change in practice and social behaviour is improbable where
there is too much contradiction and too little understanding” (Levett, 2004, p. 430).
4.1 Introduction
In this chapter an analysis of positivist discourses of paedophilia is provided. Working from a social
constructionist perspective, inherent contradictions within positivist discourses on paedophilia will
be identified and challenged.
Social constructionism is a theoretical paradigm that falls within and is informed by the
philosophical field of postmodernism (Paul & Sailor, 2004). The social constructionist perspective
breaks with conventional conceptions of social problems by analysing them as a social process of
definition. Social problems, such as paedophilia, are not seen as objective conditions to be studied
and corrected, they are rather orientations to alleged conditions that are argued to be immoral or
unjust (Holstein & Miller, 1993).
It is therefore assumed that the way in which we experience reality is not an ahistorical given, but
that it varies between different historical periods and between various cultural systems. Within the
context of this study, the conceptual tools provided by social constructionist theory will be used to
explore the multiple ways of understanding paedophilia. This theoretical position does not deny the
value of positivist discourses and views on paedophilia, but rather aims to forge a less restrictive
conceptual space in which they can begin to compete with alternative constructs of the phenomenon.
It has been demonstrated that the positivist paradigm, although limited in usefulness, is still the
dominant paradigm from which paedophilia is studied and that it informs the dominant discourses
that define and classify this phenomenon. While positivism claims to be a value-free endeavour,
critics have begun to seriously question these contentions (Green, 2002; Schmidt, 1990, 2002).
Many theorists and researchers (Gergen, 1994; Weeks, 1985) now accept, almost as axiomatic, that
contradictory to positivist ideology, morality and political agenda precede science in any positivist
study. Consequently, positivist research also contains many crucial value judgements regarding
paedophilia. These judgements are then disguised as ‘scientific findings’ that are held to be absolute



29
and unquestionable (Rind et al., 2000). The purpose of this chapter is to uncover these implicit
moral assumptions and judgements, and to show the links between these discourses and
contemporary institutions.
Three discursive substreams surrounding paedophilia were identified while conducting a literature
review on this topic, namely the discourse of sexual politics, child molester discourse and victim
discourse. In the following section each of these will be discussed with reference to relevant theory
and research findings. In order to problematise these findings, I will also present opposing research
findings where relevant.
4.2. Sexual politics
Prominent theorists and researchers (Kuhn, 1962; Popper, 1963; Weeks, 1985) have, in the course
of the past few decades, pointed out the subtle yet powerful links that exist between science as an
institution and other powerful, dominant institutions, while science purports to be a value-free,
neutral endeavour that is removed and separate from the political sphere. These theorists contend
that science, and especially science in its positivist form, often plays an important role in supporting
and even advancing certain institutions such as patriarchy, capitalism and religion. Within this
critical theoretical space, Mirkin (1999) has developed a theory of sexual politics and proposes a
two-phase model. Firstly, an issue is prevented from being seen as political (in other words related
to a power struggle) and negotiable. Instead, it is presented in terms of psychological and/or moral
categories; these categories de-politicise an issue by depicting it, for instance, as a pathology, rooted
in the realm of medical illness. Consequently, the political aspects of the issue are obfuscated. In the
case of paedophiles, this categorises them as mentally ill sexual deviants, thereby silencing any
socio-political claims and denying them any valid space from which to negotiate. The second phase
of sexual politics is characterised by an issue becoming overtly political in nature and, as such, also
becoming negotiable.
Mirkin (1999) further notes that phase one struggles are usually harder to detect, since they exist
before issues become politically visible. Moreover, he argues that most phase one struggles display
similar patterns. The pattern visible in for instance contests regarding the position of feminism in
society and the liberation of female sexuality was also present in the contests over homosexuality.
Homosexuality was first condemned as an immoral practice and psychological illness. As more and
more gay and lesbian people acknowledged their sexual orientation, their voices became louder.
Homosexual minority groups started to emerge and stood up in opposition to the dominant social



30
groups. Homosexuality started moving into the second phase of sexual politics by becoming an
overtly political and negotiable concept.
According to Mirkin (1999), the politics of paedophilia has already started to emerge in this self
same pattern. Although paedophilia is currently in the first phase, paedophilic minority groups such
as North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) have already emerged. NAMBLA
advocates, for example, the sexual rights of young people and paedophiles and argue for a change
of consent laws. In the Journal of Homosexuality, the link between the politics of homosexuality
and crossgenerational sexual relations has been made even more explicit. Graupner (1999), for
example, discussed the question whether, or to what extent, crossgenerational sexual relations with
minors could be considered to be a gay rights issue.
Crucially, Mirkin (1999) contends that the discipline of psychology has historically been the
primary arena for disputes relating to normalcy and human nature, under which all debates
regarding human sexuality will inevitably fall. Mirkin (1999) argues that, in phase one debates,
psychology has almost always functioned as a supporter of the dominant ideology. Proceeding with
the example of homosexuality, when it was trapped in the first phase of sexual politics, psychology,
and more specifically psychoanalytic theory, branded it a sexual perversion (Dollimore, 1991).
Indeed science, and thus psychology, often seems welcome as long as it leads to conclusions that
coincide with the predominant ideology of society (Bernard, 1979; Elkin, 1998; Husserl, 1970). For
the last century this has been based on positivist philosophy and epistemology (Paul & Sailor, 2004).
In summary, Mirkin (1999) suggests that positivist psychological research often supports the
dominant ideologies and institutions in society, while in turn being reinforced by these institutions.
This is also true for research on paedophilia. An example is found in the field of victimology.
Okami (1990) noted that victimologists often use legal, moral, and political criteria to supplant the
use of empirical or phenomenological criteria in their investigations. Victimology has to do with the
study of victims of crime (Schurink, 1992), while victimologists include researchers, clinicians,
political activists and popular writers. According to Okami (1990), victimologists use
argumentative devices and research methods that blur the line between social science and social
commentary or judgement. It is Okami’s (1990) contention that the social-activist posture against
paedophilia taken by many professionals has caused a body of literature that prescribes against this
phenomenon while pretending to be merely descriptive. This is the same body of literature, fuelled
by political agenda, that provides the support for viewing paedophilia as a criminal act.



31
There are, of course, many reasons why paedophilia has been so strongly condemned in our society.
One of these, and perhaps the least obvious, is to create distance between society and paedophiles,
to isolate paedophiles and to prevent symbolic contamination. However, this othering process is
more complex, as many theorists have pointed out (Cossins, 2000; Dollimore, 1991). It entails a
denial and projection on the part of ‘normal’ members of society, whereby their own paedophilic
inclinations are denied and then projected on ‘deviant’ others. This process is instrumental in
preventing members of society from having to explore or accept these inclinations. As will be
shown, research suggests that sexual attraction to children and child eroticisation are two factors
that are commonly construed as sick and deviant and thus allocated to the paedophilic realm. Yet
they are found within a ‘normal’ society.
As stated above, one of the most prominent difficulties regarding the moral condemnation of
paedophilia is that paedophilic attraction is a much more common phenomenon than it is purported
to be (Green, 2002). Research supporting this suggestion, some of which will now be presented,
comprises both clinical and self-report studies.
In Briere and Runtz’s (1989) study of 193 university male students, 21% reported some sexual
attraction to small children and 7% indicated that they might have sex with a child if not caught. In
another sample involving 100 male and 180 female undergraduate students, 22% of males and 3%
of females reported sexual attraction to a child (Smiljanich & Briere, 1996).
Clinical research has physiologically validated the self-report studies of non-clinical, non
paedophile-identified volunteers. In such a study by Freund, McKnights, Langevin and Cibri
(quoted in Green, 2002), it was found that non-paedophilic community volunteers showed
significant penile tumescence in response to images of female children as young as 6 years of age.
The extent of the reaction increased with the age of the stimulus person. In another study,
heterosexual males demonstrated erections in response to pictures of pubescent and pre-pubescent
girls (Quinsey, Steinman, Bergersen, & Holmes, 1975).
The men’s erections averaged at 70% and 50% of their responses to adult females and for pubescent
girls respectively. In a sample of 66 males recruited from hospital staff and the community, 17%
showed a penile response that was paedophilic (Fedora et al., 1992). In another a study by Firestone,
Bradford, Greenberg and Nunes (2000), nearly one-third (27.7%) of a comparison group of
unselected young men, who were compared with homicidal and non-homicidal child molesters,



32
showed a positive paedophile index, indicating their principal arousability by visual paedosexual
stimuli. These studies support the argument that paedophilic attraction is a common feature in many
‘normal’ males, and, as such, a general phenomenon in society (Green, 2002).
Finally, it is interesting to note, as Sternberg (1998) points out, that even in adult-adult relationships,
the image of the child may be re-invented. Men are often attracted to women who, in certain ways,
resemble infants having big eyes or soft skin. These men will also refer to their loved ones as cute
or cuddly, use baby talk when being affectionate or use diminutive nicknames for their lovers.
Women engage in the same behaviour by enjoying the ‘little boy’ aspects of their partner. Sternberg
(1998) names this the parental protection tendency: A person seeks not only to be protected by his
or her partner, but also to protect him or her. The notion of seeking the child within one’s love
object is, in part, also a social creation. Furthermore, some theorists argue that western civilisation
has, to a significant degree, eroticised the child (Kincaid, 1993; Levine, 1995).
One might argue that what is found to be erotic and desirable has largely been constructed by
society (Dworkin, 1987; Ericksen, 2002; Gagnon, 1990; MacKinnon, 1987). Young girls are
frequently eroticised in our culture, from children’s beauty pageants to the practice of using
underdeveloped teens to model adult women’s clothes. Models become younger and younger, and
are picked for body types that emphasise the developmental stage of early teenage (Culture watch:
pedophilic chic, 1999; Levine, 1995; Murray, 2000). It is proposed that the female object of (sexual)
desire has changed to become the infertile underweight teenager. Herrick (1999) pointed out that, if
fertility is an undesired component of sexuality, then the erotic ideal must be at or before the line of
puberty.
Kincaid (1993) suggests that Western humanity has for the past two hundred years believed a tale
of childhood innocence. He further asserts that somewhere in the vision of the child, an idea lurks
that these “smooth-faced, hairless pouting innocents are also erotic” (Kincaid quoted in Wilson,
1998, p. 46). He identifies a process of othering at work; he is of the opinion that Western culture
has sexualised the child, while fiercely denying it. Our culture partly realises that it is paedophilic
but partly deplores this fact and demonises those who actually engage in sexual approaches to
people under the age of puberty. The irony is that while paedophilia has become so despised, the
innocence of childhood itself has been systematically violated by an exploitative commodity culture.
According to Dixon (2002), there is a sexual discourse around forbidden pleasures, which states
that it is the forbidden nature of sex that makes it exciting. There are, of course, few things more
prohibited, and by implication, as exciting, than sexual relations with a child.



33
According to Mirkin (1999), the concept of paedophilia is still entangled in the first phase of sexual
politics. This has certain implications on the general understanding of paedophilia. Firstly, positivist
literature and research are used to reject any deeper exploration or understanding of paedophilia in
order to prevent this concept from being seen as political or negotiable. Secondly, this research also
denies the phenomenological experience of paedophiles any space and validity in the empirical
discourses around paedophilia, thereby discounting or marginalising the potentially significant data
that experience may have to offer in furthering our understanding of paedophilia. Thirdly, the
research prevents society from acknowledging paedophilic inclinations as being present or even
common within society. Fourthly, the Western civilisation is also prevented from acknowledging
the part it has played in eroticising the child.
4.3. ‘Child molester’ discourse
Within the realm of positivism and first phase sexual politics, another discourse has evolved that
could be termed child molester discourse (Schmidt, 2002). Child molester discourse consists of
negatively loaded terminology referring to paedophilic acts or concepts in terms associated with
criminality. These terms, commonly used in discussions of paedophilia, include words such as
abuse, assault, attack, molestation, victimisation, exploitation, child molester, offender, child sexual
abuse, sexual attacks and victim (O’Grady, 1988; Okami, 1990). O’Grady (1988) calls this the
‘slippage’ of legal and moral constructs into social science research. Child molester discourse has
also been referred to as a blunt, emotional, overgeneralised and prejudiced discourse (Schmidt,
2002).
The term child sexual abuse has been used in psychological literature to describe virtually all sexual
interactions between children or adolescents and significantly older persons, as well as between
same aged children or adolescents when coercion is involved (Rind et al., 1998). Kilpatrick (1987)
noted that researchers often fail to distinguish between abuse as some type of harm to the child and
abuse as a violation of social norms. It is not scientifically sound to assume that violations of the
social norms would necessarily lead to harm to the child. The indiscriminate use of terms such as
child sexual abuse, perpetrator and victim has also been criticised in terms of their scientific
validity (Kilpatrick, 1987; Nelson, 1989; Okami, 1990; Rind & Bauserman, 1993).



34
Another example of negatively charged words that have slipped into the social sciences is the
synonyms used for the term paedophile. The word paedophile is often used interchangeably in the
professional literature with child molester, sex offender, perpetrator, abuser, rapist and victimiser
(Ames & Houston, 1990; Bradford, Bloomberg, & Bourget, 1988; Fuller, 1989; Hobson, Boland, &
Jamieson, 1985; Kelly, 1982; McCormack & Selvaggio, 1989; Peters, 1976; Toobert, Bartelme, &
Jones, 1959; Travin, Bluestone, Coleman, & Melella, 1985). Indiscriminate interchange of the term
paedophile with terms such as child molester prevents one from making the distinction between
sexual behaviour and the sexual orientation of the paedophile (Okami & Goldberg, 1992).
In a study by Hall, Maiuro, Vitaliano and Proctor (1986) on men who had sexual relations with
children, more evidence of negatively loaded terminology was found. The authors used the term
sexual aggression to characterise the nature of the topic being studied. The authors, however, also
reported that 86% of their sample was classified as not having used force during their interactions.
Furthermore, the ‘victims’ in this study were considered ‘children’ up to the age of 18. An
unspecified portion of the study conducted by Hall et al. (1986) consisted of non-violent sexual
activities between adults and sexually mature individuals. These activities were erroneously
labelled as sexual assault and sexual aggression.
Okami (1990) argues that researchers who use negative terms indiscriminately are creating and
maintaining a biased perception of adult-child sexual relationships within society. Indeed, it is a
fundamental starting point within social constructionist theory to acknowledge the power that
language has on society. As such, several researchers have explored the influence of negative terms
on society’s perception of paedophilia. Not surprisingly, these studies often provide evidence of
biased perceptions and biased information processing in society. Some of these cases will now be
presented.
Rind and Bauserman (1993) conducted a study to determine whether the use of negative
terminology could bias perceptions and judgements of adult-child sexual relations. They found that
students’ impressions of general cases of adult-child sexual activities were significantly affected by
negative terminology. They also found that the biasing effects of negative terminology seemed to
occur without the awareness of the students. The students considered the terminology employed in
the articles they read as appropriate, whether the terminology was neutral or negative. Thus, despite
the fact that students perceived no difference in the appropriateness of the terms that were used, the



35
type of terminology used in the articles affected their evaluations and perceptions.
Another example of the influence of negatively loaded terminology on society’s perception of
paedophilia is found in the term sexual abuse. This term has in many cases become a public
overstatement (Okami, 1990), in the sense that it has attained disproportionately negative
connotations. The latter was evident in a study by Okami (1990), in which college students rated
‘sexual abuse of children’ as significantly more serious than either murder or the physical or
emotional abuse of a child. Physical abuse was rated low in seriousness. Sexual abuse was
portrayed as the most devastating experience a child could endure while physical abuse, which is at
least as destructive, has been ignored (Okami, 1990). This might reflect the general cultural
tendency of greater acceptance of violent feelings and behaviour than sexual ones. Children are
allowed to view graphic media depictions of sadistic murder, torture and mutilation, but they are not
permitted to view realistic depictions of even affectionate sexual interactions (Okami, 1990).
Evidence of biased information processing includes research by Lord, Ross and Lepper (1979).
These authors showed that individuals with strong attitudes and beliefs about an issue tend to
process information contradicting their attitudes and beliefs in a biased fashion. It was found that
students, for instance, often held extreme positions regarding certain issues, and consequently
strongly criticised contradicting evidence. Attitudes concerning adult-child sexual relations are
usually negative. Therefore, it seems likely that people will process non-negative outcome
information in a biased manner. This possibility is corroborated by a number of examples in the
professional literature (Lord et al., 1979). For example, Sandfort (1984) found that most of the boys
who participated in his research reported their sexual experiences with adult partners as positive.
Although Finkelhor (1984), Masters, Johnson and Kolodny (1985), and Marazek (1985) sharply
criticised Sandfort’s research on methodological grounds, Bauserman (1990) argued that their
methodological criticisms had been applied selectively to this positive outcome study and not to
negative studies.
However, child molester discourse does not rely solely on negatively loaded terminology and the
consequences of biased information processing. It is also supported by other assumptions regarding
paedophilia. Storr (1964) noted, for instance, that the seduction of children by adults is generally
thought harmful and that discussion regarding the actual effects is often made to seem irrelevant.
Other examples of how moral-psychological categories have suppressed certain discussions of
paedophilia include:



36
1. Victimologists claim that to study adult-child relations from an empirical rather than an
ethical viewpoint is a morally unacceptable form of bias (Finkelhor, 1984).
2. It is believed that any adult-child sexual relationship takes on some of the coercive
behavioural characteristics of rape (Herman, 1981).
3. It is assumed that children cannot initiate, or consent to, any sexual acts because they have
little or no understanding of their sexuality (Russell, 1986).
4. Reports of non-abusive paedophilic relationships are discarded as distortions of memory (of
the victim) caused by denial or repression of the ‘negative experience’ (Russell, 1986).
The above assumptions, I would argue, obstruct attempts to fully understand paedosexuality and
paedophilic relationships. As Kilpatrick (1987) noted, it mirrors an inherent conflict nested in the
project of scientific inquiry: on the one hand the inquiry is aimed towards elucidating the principles
that govern the phenomenon, but on the other hand the inquiry is subtly aimed towards reinforcing
existing social norms contained in discourses such as child molester discourse.
4.4. Victim discourse
The third and final subdiscourse to be explored rests on a belief born from child molester discourse:
there must be a victim. The two major assumptions underlying the victim discourse of paedophilia
are firstly that the child is unable to give consent (Finkelhor, 1984), and secondly, that the child is
necessarily harmed by sexual contact with adults (Russell, 1986). Within this view on paedophilia,
youths are never considered partners, initiators or willing participants in sexual contact with adults
(Mirkin, 1999). Dominant principles state that youths are always seduced, are unable to give
consent, and suffer physical and psychological harm even when they are unaware of it.
Subsequently, the younger person is variously labelled a victim (Finkelhor, 1984), molested child,
sexually exploited child (Kempe & Kempe, 1984), or survivor (Summit, 1989). These labels are
frequently employed without reference to the issue of effects on the younger individuals or to their
own characterisation of their experiences (Rind & Bauserman, 1993). All future negative symptoms
are attributed to childhood sexual experiences, while positive symptoms are attributed to surviving
and overcoming the effects of child abuse. Some researchers have explicitly asserted that
adolescents or children who perceive themselves as consenting, or who rate their experiences as
positive, should nevertheless be defined as victims (Finkelhor, 1984; Maltz, 1989; Russell, 1986).



37
However, these conclusions are derived from studies that comprise mainly of people in therapy
(Mirkin, 1999). Clearly this compromises the validity of these research findings, since these
samples are highly biased. It is safe to assume that people who seek therapy suffer some ill effects
and when studied, they would be found to experience some distress. Conversely, it is also safe to
assume that people who do not suffer from psychological harm would be statistically less likely to
be included in this type of study.
4.4.1. Consent
According to Feierman (1990), consent in its psychological (as opposed to legal) sense is a concept
that has proven to be very problematic to define and circumscribe. It is extremely difficult to
determine whether or not consent was given while behaviour is occurring and almost impossible to
determine retrospectively, except where force was used. In order to overcome this deficit, reliance
has been placed on legal principle and the age of a person has been advanced as a suitable point
from which to define consent. In most jurisdictions there is a legally determined age during which
children are not considered capable of giving consent. These consent laws, it is argued, decrease the
risk of sexual activity without consent. For example, in South Africa, the legal age for heterosexual
intercourse is 16, whereas the legal age for homosexual intercourse is 19 years. Section 14 of the
Sexual Offences Act, 1957 (South African Law Commission, 1997) states the following:
Any male person who
1. Has or attempts to have unlawful carnal intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 years; or
2. Commits or attempts to commit with such a girl, or a boy under the age of 19 years, an
immoral or indecent act; or
3. Solicits or entices such a boy to the commission of an indecent or immoral act, shall be
guilty of an offence.
According to Wellings, Field, Johnson and Wadsworth (1994), there has historically been a
tendency in Western societies to prolong the duration of adolescence. However, the gap between
sexual and social maturity has never been as wide as it is today. This has also led to a greater divide
between the socially and legally acceptable ages for engaging in sexual behaviour. Sexual activity
between adolescents has become more acceptable socially, but the age of consent has not changed.
Consent laws might therefore be causing the criminalisation of many teenagers who engage in
victimless under-age sex (Tatchell, 1995).



38
Weeks (1985) argues that the ages specified in consent laws might have degrees of absurdity about
them, but that they do provide a bottom line in the acceptance of appropriate behaviour. This
implies that the lowering of the age of consent would lead to a rise in inappropriate behaviour. Yet
this is not always the case. In Spain, Malta and the Netherlands the age of consent for heterosexual
intercourse is 12 (Royal Commission into the New South Wales Polices Service, 1997, quoted in
Cossins, 2000). According to Tatchell (1995), the introduction of these relatively low ages of
consent has not led to any increase in the sexual abuse of young people. A possible conclusion
stemming from this would be that consent laws, while reinforcing notions of victimhood, do not
really contribute to the prevention of under-age sexual activity among adolescents at least. Consent
laws do, however, illustrate the socially constructed nature of sexuality, and paedosexuality.
Apart from the emotional and psychological risks that under-aged sex poses to minors, there are
also physiological risks associated with under-aged sex, including pregnancy, cervical dysphasia
and sexually transmitted disease. Durbin et al. (1993) found that teenagers who start sexual
relationships under the age of 13 are 9 times more likely to report multiple partners than those who
wait until they are 15 or 16. Stuart-Smith (1996) suggests that the younger the age of first
intercourse, the greater the risks involved. The frontal lobe of the brain, which deals with the
control of sexual impulses and abstract reasoning and planning, is not completely myelinated until
14 or 15 years of age. Before this age, the child is still cognitively immature. Therefore, it may be
difficult for a person before this age to fully understand the implications of his or her behaviour.
These individuals may not be able to fully comprehend the decisions they make. Major changes
occur between early and late adolescence, such as the capacity to see things from different
perspectives, to reason abstractly and to predict future consequences (Stuart-Smith, 1996), by which
time it becomes a less risky endeavour to make decisions.
Even though there are clearly important psychological and emotional dimensions to the issue of
under-age sex, there is still relatively little known about the actual effect of early intercourse on
subsequent psychological functioning. The complexity and difficulty in defining the concept of
consent also obfuscates studying the effects of under-age sex, as the concept under investigation
remains unclear (Soble, 1998).
Foucault (1998) argues that the refusal to accept the possibility that a child may authentically
consent to sex with an adult is a major aspect of the paternalism adopted by the law and psychiatry.
Children may not have the ability to articulate what they feel or want. When they are unable to



39
formulate these desires the courts presume to speak for them. Foucault (1998) portrays this as the
imposition of overpowering discourses on the subdued discourses of the child.
However, Alcoff (1998) noted that adults who interpret children’s behaviour and linguistic practices
as consent are imposing their own usage of consent across a linguistic border over which meanings
could change drastically. It is therefore dangerous to assume that because some childhood
behaviour appear sexual to adults, they must be sexual. An infant or child engaged in genital play
(even if orgasm is observed) can in no sense be seen as experiencing the complex set of feelings
that accompanies adult or even adolescent masturbation. From this perspective, the discourse of
child sexuality will always be distinct in significant ways from the discourse of adult sexuality
(Alcoff, 1998).
Schmidt (2002) also asserted that sexual consensus cannot exist between adults and children.
Consensus can only be achieved if everyone involved is acting from the same social script. Children
do not yet follow the same sexual scripts or recognise the same sexual meanings as adults (Gagnon
& Simon, 1973). Therefore, genital manipulation by children, even when it leads to erection and
orgasm, will differ significantly from adult masturbation, which is accompanied by erotic fantasies
and scripts. Moreover, the adult is fully aware of the sexual connotations of his actions, as he lives
in a world of heavily sexualised symbols and language, which the child does not understand (Weeks,
1985).
Research findings supporting the difference in sexual scripts of adults and children include a study
by Sandfort (1982). He studied 25 boys engaged in man-boy relations. He found that the potentially
provocative acts of children are not necessarily consciously intended to be sexual and are only
interpreted by the older persons as having a sexual element. Again, this is an example of the
differences in the sexual scripts, and the awareness thereof, between adults and children.
Soble (1998) proposes that the ability of children to give meaningful consent to sex depends on
what the significance of sex is believed to be – whether sex is more like a natural, daily activity or
an act that aims at spiritual connectedness. However, even when adults have established the
significance that sex has for them, the child still has to find it. From this proposition the following
question emerges: Is a child capable of choosing whether sexual activity is to be a special
commitment or an everyday activity when the child still has little insight or self-knowledge on the



40
effect that sex could have on him or her and future decisions? When a prepubertal child is exposed
to sex, the right to decide on the significance of sex may, in a sense, be taken away from him or her.
In acknowledging the great differences between children and adults in terms of power and influence,
knowledge and insight, sexual scripts and discourse, dependence and autonomy, it seems that
consent to paedophilic relationships will remain problematic (Schmidt, 2002). However, the fact
that consent remains a problematic issue should not be used as an excuse to halt or divert research
that seeks to improve understanding of paedophilia, as this would reproduce the paternalism and
oppression typical of positivism (Foucault, 1998).
Ultimately, the concept of consent implies that sex is a contractual relationship. However, this
consensual/contractual model has limited use when applied to sexual engagement. It implies that
sex is only an exchange or trade; consisting of a request and an answer. Although this model makes
sense theoretically, it seems a formalistic and oversimplified way of referring to sexual contact in
practical terms. Many might argue that a sexual relationship is much richer and more complex when
viewed as a mutual engagement (Alcoff, 1998). Moreover, whereas consent would require the
spoken word “yes”; mutual engagement would rather require absence of the word “no”. In a study
by Perper (quoted in Harvey & Weber, 2002) on communication and sexuality, a 19-year old man
explained how he perceived mutual engagement:
The idea here is simple. There are steps that one follows which lead up to the actual
act. No words are desired or necessary. A positive response to one step allows the next
step to be initiated, and this continues until she conveys to me the desire to stop the
progression. I find it no problem to know when she would like to stop. If we don’t
stop, we arrive. (p. 65)
In this study the consent to sexual behaviour within a romantic relationship (paedo-relationship)
will be redefined as the presence or absence of a mutual agreement thereto. This also prevents one
from becoming intellectually and discursively entangled in the discourse of consent.
4.4.2. The assumption of harm
The second assumption of victim discourse to be explored is that adult-child sexual behaviour is
generally thought harmful, even to the point that discussion regarding the actual effects might seem
irrelevant (Storr, 1964). Harm might be conceptualised as including physical, emotional and
psychological harm. There is strong evidence to suggest that a number of adult-child relationships



41
are indeed unpleasant or traumatic for the child (Bagley, Wood, & Young, 1994; Bartol, 1995;
Finkelhor & Brown, 1987; Kilpatrick, 1987). However, in staying true to the search for better
understanding, I would suggest that it is also important to consider those cases where no evidence
of lasting harm was present (Okami, 1991; Rind et al., 1998; Sandfort, 1984).
Most research in this field, including studies conducted by victimologists, documents a low
incidence of violence (physical harm) or forceful coercion in cases of adult-child sexual behaviour
(Okami, 1990). It is crucial to distinguish paedophilia from child rape, especially in the South
African context where the incidence of child and ‘baby rape’ has increased dramatically over the
last five years and media coverage has contributed to the grouping together of paedophiles and child
rapists. While it is difficult not to remember these harrowing accounts when discussing a concept
such as adult-child sexual relations, it has been found that the social and legal consequences of
violent sexual acts (such as child rape) differ from cases of adult-child sexual relations where no
force or coercion is present (Mohr, 1978; Okami & Goldberg, 1992; Panton, 1978).
Violence and overt coercion are not generally characteristics of paedosexual behaviour and do not
play a meaningful part in adult-child relationships (Okami & Goldberg, 1992), although it is often
portrayed as such by the media (Levine, 1995). Therefore, a child rapist is a rapist first and foremost
and may or may not be a paedophile. A paedophile, however, who refrains from violence or
forceful coercion, cannot be termed a rapist. From an empirical point of view, it is therefore
incongruous to categorise adult-child sexual behaviour as a violent crime, to study it as such, and to
engage in discourse permeated by vocabulary and imagery appropriate to the study of violence.
This study focuses exclusively on paedophiles that do not employ physical violence or force.
Extensive research has been conducted on the harm caused to children by sexual contact with adults.
Bartol (1995) mentioned that the most harm is caused to a child when:
1. adult-child sexual behaviour occurs over a long period of time;
2. penetration occurs;
3. the adult is known to the child; and
4. aggression forms part of the sexual behaviour.
Paedophilic sexual contact is commonly seen as more serious when penetration or force occurred
and when the contact occurred inside the family (Finkelhor & Brown, 1987). Limitations of the
above approach to assessing the potential for trauma are that they represent an overly simplistic
classification of experiences in terms of degrees of seriousness. As such, these classifications do not



42
imply anything about the character of the effect (Bartol, 1995), or why these factors increase the
‘harm’.
Finkelhor and Brown (1987) identified four traumatic dynamics as an organising framework for
studying the effects of sexual abuse. The term traumagenic dynamics refers to the phases of trauma
the child may experience as a result of child sexual abuse. The first of these dynamics is traumatic
sexualisation with behavioural manifestations, such as sexual preoccupations, precocious sexual
activity, aggressive sexual behaviour and/or sexual dysfunction. The second is stigmatisation,
which could be observed in the child through isolation, criminal involvement, self-mutilation, drug
or alcohol abuse or suicidal behaviour. The third dynamic is behavioural manifestations of betrayal:
clinging, delinquency, discomfort in intimate relationships, or allowing own children to be
victimised. The fourth dynamic, namely powerlessness, might manifest in nightmares, phobias,
depression, school/employment problems, somatic complaints or becoming an abuser.
Although Finkelhor and Brown’s (1987) framework provides a structure to identify harm while
providing characteristics of the effect of harm, there is a growing concern with regards to the
validity of this theory. Increased susceptibility to delinquency, drug abuse, criminal behaviour,
memory problems, confusion, impulsive and self-injurious behaviour, hysteria, personality
disorders, characterological disorders, and even schizophrenia and other chronic psychoses have
been attributed to adult heterosexual and homosexual behaviour with young individuals. However,
since adult-child sexual activity is a phenomenon that is impossible to study in a purely
experimental manner, the research findings cannot go far beyond establishing certain correlations
(Feierman, 1990). It is impossible, for instance, to establish causality. These research findings are
further confounded by the fact that a long period of time usually elapses between the instance of
childhood sexual activity and the reporting and study thereof. This implies that the confounding
variables of history and maturation will influence the research findings.
In contradiction to the assumption that adult-child sexual relationships necessarily cause harm,
research findings that portray the absence of harm and even positive experiences by children in
adult-child relationships will now be presented. Bernard (1979) conducted a study using the
biographical method. The test persons were adults who as children had sexual contacts with one or
more adults. In Bernard’s results the following trends emerged:
1. Children can experience sexual contacts and relationships with adult as positive.
2. Children look for love, affection and security in addition to the sexual aspect.
3. No traumatic influence or fears toward adults were present.



43
4. Later sexual orientation was not influenced by the initiation.
5. The sexual activity was predominantly masturbatory in nature.
6. In some cases the friendship continued after the sexual contact had come to an end.
7. The attitude of society had a negative effect on the test persons.
Bryant (1982) also noted that children might enjoy a significant or affectionate relationship with the
paedophile and that force and coercion may not necessarily be involved. Bernard (1979) and Bryant
(1982) both found society’s attitude and reaction to be the most likely factor to cause harm to the
child involved in an adult-child relationship. This was, however, only found to be true in
relationships where physical violence was absent. In another study by Doll, Barholow and Harrison
(1992), 1 001 homosexual and bisexual men were surveyed. Of these men, 42% reported a history
of sexual relationships with adults as children, and only 39% of those men said they had viewed the
experience negatively at the time of contact and again at the time of the interview, while 27%
reported that they had viewed the experience positively at the time of contact. The longer the
paedophilic relationship lasted, the more it was likely to be remembered positively (in contradiction
to the findings of Bartol (1995)). More studies have found that sexual experiences in childhood with
older partners are sometimes regarded as positive experiences by the children themselves (Okami,
1991; Sandfort, 1984). Although these studies aroused much controversy and received much
criticism (Ondersma et al., 2001), they have shifted the rigid assumption that all sexual contact
during childhood necessarily results in psychological or emotional trauma or injury.
More recent studies include that of Rind et al. (1998). They also examined the belief many lay
persons and professionals share: that paedophilic relationships cause intense harm to children,
regardless of their gender. Rind et al. (1998) reviewed 59 studies based on college samples. Self
reported reactions to sexual abuse during childhood indicated that the negative effects were neither
pervasive nor typically intense, and that men reacted much less negatively than women. A wide
range of responses to such experience occurs, ranging from very negative to very positive. This also
supports Constantine’s (1981) conclusion that child sexual abuse has no inbuilt or inevitable
outcome or set of emotional reactions. Furthermore, it was found that if the experiences were
perceived as consensual, they were experienced to be more positive.
However, in cases where sexual contact is perceived as a positive experience for the child, trauma
may result from subsequent events, such as interaction with law enforcement officials. Other events
that have been found to be harmful to the child include overreaction from the parents, lack of



44
parental support, insensitive police interrogation, legal proceedings and social alienation (Cossins,
2000; Finkelhor, 1987; O’Hagan, 1989).
The child might also experience trauma in connection with anxiety and guilt about what happens to
the paedophile and the subsequent impact on the relationship between the child and the paedophile.
Various authorities that have examined children previously involved in adult-child relationships
have concluded that the emotional, as opposed to the physical, damage done to children is more the
result of adult horror than of anything intrinsically dreadful in the sexual contact itself (Bernard,
1979; Cossins, 2000; O’Hagan, 1989; Storr, 1964). As such, the emotional reactions of parents,
police officers and other adults might disturb the child even more seriously than the sexual contacts
(O’Hagan, 1989).
Professionals who adopt the victimologist approach could also possibly cause harm to minors
involved in adult-child sexual relationships. These professionals tend to be unreceptive to positive
self-reports from children involved in adult-child sexual behaviour and assume that positive self
reports originate from traumatisation or disgust. Nelson (quoted in Okami, 1990) cites a
participant’s response in a study she conducted: “My therapist is so opinionated against child
molesters that she wouldn’t be able to understand if I told her I enjoyed it. I’m sure she’d kill me”
(p. 110). Greer (1975) noted in one case that the psychiatrist’s denial of a client’s positive memory
of a sexual relationship with her uncle caused her to fake symptoms. The client also developed
extreme guilt for not feeling guilty.
In summary, challenging some of the underlying assumptions of victim discourse makes it possible
to entertain what would be viewed by many as taboo: the possibility that harm is perhaps not
universal and not uniformly intense. Victim discourse serves to silence these possibilities. Although
the existence of positive experiences does not necessarily make adult-child relationships harmless,
it does give rise to alternative narratives of positive adult-child relationship experiences. I tend to
agree with Schmidt (2002) that trauma may be inherent in sexual activity between adults and
children as a result of power and other inequalities and, therefore, remains morally unacceptable,
although the activity does not necessarily cause harm in every case. However, the assumptions
underlying victim discourse, namely that it inevitably causes harm, and that children cannot consent
to sexual activity, might be causing far more harm to children who have experienced adult-child
relationships. Indeed, the assumption of harm within victim discourse might have become a self
fulfilling prophecy; if harm does not arise from the sexual contact, it will from the resulting
condemnation thereof.

4.5. Conclusion
This chapter has attempted an in-depth analysis of the positivist influence on the understanding and
construct of paedophilia. Positivist and moral assumptions were found to drive discourses on
paedophilia perpetuating judgement and condemnation of this phenomenon. It has also played a
critical role in influencing scientific research to conceal or at least marginalise contradictory
evidence. In the words of Levett (2004): “the boundaries of conventional thinking seem to be both
impermeable and self-perpetuating. We need to address and review the situation to begin to
understand why the research keeps running into cul-de-sacs” (p. 430). The necessity for research on
paedophilia from another perspective has therefore been affirmed in this chapter.

5. METHODOLOGY
5.1. Methodological framework
This study is explorative in nature and aimed at gaining insight into how a paedophile constructs his
relationships with children. According to Mays and Pope (1993), the goal of qualitative research is
the development of concepts that can aid our understanding of social phenomena with a strong
focus on meaning, experience and perception of the participants. This study’s meta-philosophical
grounding is in social constructionism, which breaks with conventional conceptions of social
problems by analysing them as a social process of definition, rather than a fixed definition of
meaning (Gergen, 1973).
Gergen (1994) identified a few basic assumptions for social constructionism. Firstly, the structures
through which we understand ourselves and the world are social artefacts produced through history
and culture. Secondly, the lifetime of a certain view of the world is dependent on the social process
and not the objective validity of that viewpoint. And thirdly, by re-evaluating existing forms of
discourse, we evaluate patterns of cultural life, which again would give rise to other cultural
phenomena.
It is therefore possible to view paedophilia, depicted by the positivist paradigm as an immoral taboo,
as a socially constructed phenomenon whose meaning has changed and will continue to change
over time and place.
Within the paradigm of social constructionism, the approach of the researcher is typically a
phenomenological interpretive approach. Phenomenology is concerned with the study of experience
from the perspective of the individual (Burr, 1995; Stanley & Wise, 1993). The researcher interprets
the phenomenological experience of the individual and consequently the researcher also plays an
active role in the research. As such, the researcher becomes a visible part of the research, rather than
being an invisible observer (Stanley & Wise, 1993). This approach acknowledges that one can only
present an interpretation of a phenomenon, and not the phenomenon itself. Furthermore, this
approach implicitly challenges normative assumptions and existing power relations, as the focus
remains squarely on the experience world of the individual.



47
The intention of this study is to describe the male paedophile’s experience of his paedo-relationship.
In this study, this was done by exploring paedophilia though the lens of close relationships. This
framework locates paedosexual relationships within a more value-neutral discourse that is within
the experiential field of all adults, and as such, less strange, frightening, deviant or evil.
In line with the theoretical assumptions of this study, I carefully noted my own thoughts and
interpretations. This process assisted me in several ways:
1. The process created a heightened awareness in me of my thoughts, thought processes and
possible judgements concerning paedophilia.
2. The experience of conducting this entire research project was captured for future use and
reference.
5.2. Research process
In order to conduct this study, I found it necessary to place certain limits on the concept of
paedophilia. Upon perusal of the literature, it was decided that this study would define a paedophile
as an adult who has engaged in sexual fantasy and activity with a person of 13 years or younger. In
the attempt to identify men who have experienced paedo-relationships as intimate close
relationships, certain additional criteria, once again in line with the literature review, were
formulated:
1. No violence may have occurred in the relationship.
2. The relationship should have continued over a period of time.
3. The love object could not be biologically related to the paedophile.
4. Only male individuals would be studied.
Since this is not a quantitative study, no attempt was made to generalise to a population. A
systematic, non-probabilistic sampling approach (Mays & Pope, 1995) was used. The purpose,
therefore, was not to establish a random or representative sample drawn from a population, but
rather to identify specific individuals who possess characteristics of the phenomenon being studied.
Specifically, the technique of purposive sampling was used to select a sample of paedophiles.



48
5.2.1. Participants
In an attempt to access paedophiles that fit the above criteria, I approached the Department of
Correctional Services, and was directed to a psychologist at the psychology department of the
Western Cape Police.
During a meeting with this psychologist, I was referred to the Child Protection Unit (CPU), and an
expert in ethics associated with the Police Service. I met with the Superintendent of the CPU and
received a list of convicted ‘child molesters’ (term used by correctional services). However, the
CPU could not reveal which prisons the convicted child molesters had been sent to, and contacting
these individuals was therefore impossible. Consequently, I approached the Western Cape
Prosecutor of Sexual Offences, but I was not able to obtain the names or location of convicted child
molesters as these details were held confidential.
I then approached the head of the Department of Social Services in the Western Cape. I was
directed to a renowned social worker, who had been the first in South Africa to design treatment
programmes for ‘child molesters’. However, it was not possible to work with the men in her
therapeutic groups at Kenilworth Clinic, as they were engaged in therapy. Interference would have
raised ethical issues and could potentially have hindered the effectiveness of their therapy. The
Kenilworth Clinic was at the time the only clinic in the Western Cape that provided treatment for
‘child molesters’. I received a disconcerting picture of the search one undergoes to locate
participants for a study on child molesters or paedophiles. It was stated that it could take up to two
years to receive authorisation to access prisoners as participants.
I was advised to meet with individuals on trial for child sexual abuse, and to approach them
independently. This posed several problems. I would need to wait for the opportunity for the next
individual to be on trial for child sexual abuse. Being on trial, the defendant might not wish to
discuss his case. If the defendant did wish to discuss his case, his current situation might
consequently influence him not to speak frankly or truthfully. Ethical considerations deterred me
from seeking out and approaching active paedophiles in the community.
Finally, of necessity, I decided to apply at the Department of Correctional Services for authorisation
to access prisoners as participants for the study. This process took six months. The name of the
identified prison had to be stated in the application form. Authorisation to visit Pollsmoor Prison
was granted to me in December 2001.



49
An interview was scheduled with the Head Keeper to present my requests and action plan. Dates
were scheduled during this meeting for me to access records of child offenders at the Medium B
Prison. I completed analyses of the records in two days, as there was a limit to the time allocated for
accessing confidential records. Eleven potential participants were identified for the research project
and meetings were arranged with each of them. Each meeting consisted of:
1. an explanation of the intended research;
2. criteria of potential participants;
3. a match of these criteria with the experiences of the individual;
4. an offer of participation to the individual if he met the criteria; and
5. a request for consent in writing from the participant (see Addendum A).
Only three participants were both eligible and willing to participate. New interview dates and
locations were arranged for each participant with assistance of the Head Keeper. The following
issues regarding the general location, i.e. Pollsmoor Prison, were considered:
1. The fact that the participants were already convicted of child sexual assault could aid the
process of freely expressing their experiences, since they did not need to fear any additional
consequences. Before their trial such interviews would be unwise, as the behaviour (termed
child sexual assault in forensic language) remains against the law, and might suppress
honest recounts of their experiences. It was assumed that an interviewee that has already
been convicted would be more prone to honesty and openness during the interview.
2. The participants are bound to their location (prison). This made it easier to locate the
participant and approach the individual. However, at all times the individual would retain
the right not to consent to this process.
3. The location could influence the validity of the data, as some of the participants have
engaged in the sexual offender programme. Therefore, they may have experienced some
altered beliefs or thoughts since their relations with children. As such, I adopted a
heightened sensitivity regarding any contradictions in the data.
4. Interviewees might fear that the content of the interviews reach the Parole Board. This, in
turn, could influence the trust of the interviewee in the interviewer. Therefore, the
confidentiality of these interviews was regularly highlighted to the participants.
5.2.2. Instruments: qualitative interviews
Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with each of the three participants. Each
interview lasted between two and three hours. Thematic guidelines were created for the interviews
(Addendum B). The research questions were formulated with the intention of encouraging



50
participants to articulate in their own words their psychological experience of their paedophilic
relationships: I was interested in how these participants in their particular social contexts construct
their experiences of being in a paedophilic relationship. I remained open, however, to new and
alternative themes that emerged during the interviews and the agenda was therefore kept flexible.
The interviews were recorded on audio tape. The tapes were transcribed verbatim.
5.2.3. Analysis of the data
A qualitative thematic analysis (Benner, 1985) was performed. I approached the data by
familiarising myself with the contents and allowing the themes to emerge. This was done by
reading the transcribed data numerous times, and repeatedly listening to the audio taped interviews.
Emerging themes were identified and subthemes were established. A detailed account of the
analysis procedure is provided in section 5.4.4.
5.2.4. Final stages and conclusion
The description of three paedophiles’ experience of paedo-relationships and my comments were
continually refined and integrated. I then revisited the literature review and amended the focus in
accordance with the participants’ experiences. Throughout the whole research process care was
taken to keep the research process self-reflexive as well as flexible, in keeping with social
constructionist theory and methodology.
5. 3. Research techniques
Qualitative interviews were used to gather data for this study. Qualitative interviewing refers to an
in-depth, semi-structured form of interviewing (Mason, 1996). Semi-structured interviews consist
of a loose structure, which entails open-ended questions that define the area to be explored.
However, the interviewer or interviewee may diverge and pursue an idea in more detail, or even
create a new idea (Britten, 1995).
The five predominant supporting reasons, identified by Britten (1995) and adopted in this study,
that underlie the decision to use qualitative interviewing, include:
1. I, the researcher, assumed people’s knowledge, views, understandings, interpretations,
experiences and interactions to be meaningful properties of the social reality that the
research questions were designed to explore. I am only able to gain access to the
interpretations and understandings of the phenomenon that are revealed in an interview.



51
2. I wished to achieve depth and roundness of understanding in the study areas, rather than a
broad understanding of surface patterns. It was assumed that in order to achieve data that is
comparable in key ways, it might be necessary to ask different questions to different
interviewees. The points of comparison depended on the research questions and themes that
emerged from the data.
3. As researcher, I was conceptualised as active and reflexive in the process of data generation,
rather than neutral in data collection. I continually analysed my role within this process.
4. The data was not feasibly available in any other form.
5. Qualitative interviewing is more likely to generate a fairer and fuller representation of the
interviewee’s perspectives. As interviewer, I was able to be more responsive in the interview
interaction (than in a structured interview). I had more flexibility to answer questions, give
information, support and reassurance in order to create safety and comfort for the
interviewee.
In deciding how the questions should be asked, the following parameters were defined. The
questions had to make sense to the interviewee and be related to the interviewee; be sensitive to the
needs and rights of the interviewee, in accordance with my ethical position; encourage the flow of
the interview; and ensure appropriate focus on issues and topics relevant to the research questions.
5.4. Analysis
5.4.1. Ensuring rigour in qualitative research
Basic strategies to ensure rigour in the qualitative research included systematic and self-conscious
research design, data collection, interpretation and communication. In addition to the above, and
following the advice of Mays and Pope (1993), I also 1) created an account of the methods used to
obtain as well as analyse the data (this ensures that another trained researcher could analyse the
same data following similar procedures) and 2) produced a plausible and coherent explanation of
the phenomena under scrutiny.
5.4.2. Enhancing reliability of the analysis
Mason (1996) suggested that the foremost method to ensure retest reliability in qualitative research
is to maintain meticulous records of interviews and observations and by documenting the process of
analysis in detail. The interviews, recorded on audio tape, were transcribed and each step of the
process was documented. Furthermore, I had a trained clinical psychologist who acted as my



52
supervisor, who independently assessed the transcripts, thereby contributing to the reliability of the
analysis.
Computer software available to facilitate the analysis of the content of the interviews was
considered. There are ongoing debates about the potential methodological costs and benefits of
computer use in qualitative research (Kelle, 1997). Coffey, Holbrook and Atkinson (1996)
expressed their concerns regarding the increasing use of specific computer software that could lead
researchers to adopt a new attitude to qualitative analysis that count against postmodernist and
poststructuralist trends within ethnography. These concerns, as well as the limited accessibility of
these computer programmes, played a role in the decision not to use computer software in the
analysis of the data for this study. An implicit approach for analysing the data was chosen for this
study (see 5.4.4.).
5.4.3. Enhancing validity
According to Mason (1996), the thoroughness with which the researcher examines ‘negative’ or
‘deviant’ cases that do not fit with the general hypothesis enhances validity. This phenomenological
study did not assume that there could be only one ‘right’ or objective perspective of the
phenomenon (in keeping with its social constructionist position). Rather, it acknowledges different
subjective views of the experience and therefore no perspectives were typified as deviant from a
general or expected perspective, nor was there even a ‘general, expected’ perspective.
I also accepted my role as part of the emerging research. My own ideas and thoughts were carefully
documented during the research process and formed an integral part of the analysis, as will be
presented in the description and discussion sections of this paper.
To minimise researcher bias in the presentation of the results, some theorists suggest that a full
transcript of the raw data should be made available to the reader on microfilm or computer disk
(Mays & Pope, 1995). However, in this case the raw data is confidential to ensure the protection of
the participants, and thus not accessible to the reader. It is my hope that by presenting a step-by-step
account of the analysis procedure, it will enable readers and future researchers to engage in a
similar endeavour using similar methods. Of course, from a phenomenological perspective it is
acknowledged that the reader would not reach exactly the same conclusions as I did.



53
5.4.4. An account of all procedures in the analysis
An account of all the procedures in the process of analysis was kept in order to ensure rigour and
reliability (Mason, 1996) of the research. The procedures were as follows:
1. The interview tapes were transcribed.
2. The transcribed data was edited by eliminating big chunks of text that diverged totally from
the research questions, related topics, significant information or phenomena under research.
3. I read the material repeatedly until a robust image of the material had been achieved.
4. The three transcripts of the interviews were kept separate during the following steps to
ensure that the new themes that emerged and existing themes that were encouraged by the
interview questions remained ‘uncontaminated’ by other participants’ experiences.
5. The data was divided into general topics, according to the leading questions I asked as
interviewer.
6. My words were removed from the data, so that only the words of the interviewee remained
under each heading of the rough topics.
7. The original tapes were listened to again, to ensure that any audible significance in the
interview would not be lost during the process.
8. Under each topic I added my own comments on the data, which included my own thoughts,
questions, possible meanings and significance of the data.
9. The general topics were subdivided into smaller themes introduced by subheadings.
10. The smaller themes (subheadings) consisted of concepts and areas that were identified prior
to the interviews as related to the research questions, as well as new themes that emerged
from the interviews.
11. Each interview was scrutinised to seek out text, relevant to the identified topic, which was
moved to the specific topic to which it related.
12. The three interviews were then put side by side to identify common themes and to highlight
themes that were significant to the specific participant.
13. My comments were deleted from the text (and were placed in a new draft) to allow only the
words of the participants to remain.
14. The data of the three participants were then integrated to form a general description of their
experiences.
15. The original data was examined once again, in search for any final significant themes. The
new themes were integrated into the existing description to add richness to the analysis.
16. The description was refined to highlight all data significant to the research questions.



54
17. My comments were woven into the description, and elaborated on, thus forming a narrative
description of the three participants’ experience with interpretative comments of the
researcher.
5.5. Ethical considerations
The participants were informed of the method and objectives of the research in the first ‘screening’
interview. Willingness to participate in this research was indicated in writing (informed consent).
Furthermore, the interviews were conducted in an empathic manner to prevent any psychological
harm and to minimise emotional distress of the participants. The identity of each participant was
kept and remains confidential.

6. THE DISCOURSE OF CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS
6.1. Introduction
In previous chapters I have argued for the need to establish another perspective from which to view
paedophilia. Furthermore, it was shown to be a prerequisite towards conducting further explorative
research in this field. This chapter will be dedicated to discussing the concept of close relationships,
which may prove useful as a framework to cast paedophilia in a different light.
To be involved in a close relationship could be construed as a basic human need: At some point in
their lives, most people will experience a need for the closeness of another person, a closeness that
opens up a space in which one can be seen, heard and loved (Glasser, 1995; Harvey & Weber,
2002). People look to close relationships and family as primary sources for fulfilment and happiness
and general satisfaction with life (Campbell et al., 1976; Freedman, 1978; Myers & Diener, 1995;
Seligman, 2002). Freedman (1978) asserted: “There is no simple recipe for producing happiness,
but all of the research indicates that for almost everyone one necessary ingredient is some kind of
satisfying, intimate relationship” (p. 48).
A close relationship may be defined as the space that emerges between two people when certain
elements are present. These may include love, intimacy, self-disclosure, sexual activity,
commitment, power and vulnerability (Harvey & Weber, 2002). Maybe even more crucial are the
feelings that flow forth from a close relationship for both participants, for example feeling
acknowledged, loved, accepted, validated and safe. The need for these elements in one’s life and the
need for the personal fulfilment thereof drive us to engage in intimate relationships.
6.2. Close relationships as a conceptual framework
It can be assumed that a paedophile may have the same universal need and desire for close
relationships as any other adult. The paedophile may too have a need for love, intimacy and sexual
disclosure. It is from this assumption that the study will explore how a paedophile’s need for a close
relationship may be similar, or different, to universal ideas of what a close relationship consists of.
The paedophile, however, chooses to meet these needs by creating a close relationship with a child.
A distinction is made here between the need and the behavioural manifestation of the need. This
distinction makes it possible to identify and describe the paedophile’s needs, without validating or
assenting to the behaviour.



56
A further rationale for presenting paedophilia within a framework of close relationships is that the
moral judgement and condemnation implicit in traditional approaches is circumvented, thereby
opening avenues for the development of alternative terms and constructs that could be employed in
future research of paedophilia.
In the following section, the concept of close relationships will be discussed by identifying and
describing different aspects thereof (McKinney & Sprecher, 1991). To accomplish this, reference
will be made to relevant literature. The facets that will be discussed in this section are sexuality,
sexual desire, pleasure, intimacy, self-disclosure, love, and power and control. Although these will
be analysed separately, I acknowledge that this is problematic on a theoretical level, since these
concepts are in fact highly interrelated. I will attempt, throughout, to give voice to divergent views
on, and definitions of, the aspects of the close relationship.
6.3. The courtship
Courtship can be seen as an introduction to a close relationship (Grammer, 1989). Two phases of
courtship behaviour have been distinguished (Kalma & De Weerth, 1995). Phase one points to the
first move of establishing contact, and phase two refers to self-presentation after contact has been
made. The importance of courtship behaviour should not be underestimated; it is the starting point
from which an intimate relationship is established, one that has the potential to develop into close
bonds such as sexual commitments. As such, the function of this behaviour could be seen as
optimising the reproductive potential (Kalma & De Weerth, 1995), as well as providing an
opportunity to evaluate the prospective partner (Grammer, 1989). Givens (1978) asserted that
submissive-affiliative, attentional and childcare-related non-verbal signs govern courtship
behaviour. These signs attempt to lure the other individual into an affectionate response. According
to Givens (1978), verbal behaviour is essential for the development of courtship. In general it has
been observed that there is a ritualised sequence to courtship behaviour, characterised by a series of
behaviour that indicate increasing closeness between partners.
6.4. Sexuality
It is generally acknowledged that attempts to define human sexuality have been hamstrung by a lack
of conceptual clarity. Vague concepts are used when referring to sexuality, and it is often not clear



57
precisely what is being discussed (Reiss, 1986). However, it seems that in the midst of conceptual
ambiguity, social constructionism may offer a way of reducing some of the uncertainty and
confusion that surrounds this concept.
Reiss (1991) believes in a universal, shared meaning of human sexuality: “Human sexuality in all
societies consists of cultural scripts shared by a group aimed at producing an erotic response in the
participants (arousal) and in turn to produce genital response” (p. 19). According to Reiss (1991),
these sexual scripts are derived from the shared, consensual beliefs in a particular society about
what constitutes good and bad sexuality. The sexual scripts act as a guide regarding what a society
believes is the proper circumstances for experiencing an erotic response. Hartsock (1997) further
suggested that sexuality should not be understood as an essence or set of properties defining an
individual, nor as a set of drives and needs of an individual. Rather, sexuality should be understood
as culturally and historically defined and constructed. As Hartsock (1997) noted, anything could
become eroticised.
These theorists argue that sexuality is not a fixed essence of human nature, but rather a flexible set
of attitudes that may be shaped by learning, choice and action. They depict sexual behaviour as a
complex construct that is defined largely by one’s culture, instead of simple instinctual determinism
(Reiss & Lee, 1989; Simon & Gagnon, 1977). Weeks (1986) further explains sexuality as a product
of social and historical forces by describing sexuality as a “fictional unity that once did not exist,
and at some time in the future may not exist again” (p. 15). Weeks’ (1986) assertion supports the
idea that the meanings we give to sexuality are socially constituted and organised, and sustained by
a variety of languages (or discourses) that seek to tell us what sexuality ought to be.
According to McKinney and Sprecher (1991), close relationships have been the most widely known
and accepted context within which sexuality and sexual behaviour has manifested. Humans
experience the majority of their erotic life in relationships that have varying degrees of closeness or
intimacy (McKinney & Sprecher, 1991). When two people are involved sexually, they usually
interact frequently, engage in several activities together, and influence each other’s behaviour,
decisions and goals. Kelley et al. (1983) notes that such a ‘close relationship’ usually has a high
degree of interdependence. A high degree of interdependence between two people could be revealed
in four properties of their interconnected activities:
1. Having frequent impact on each other.
2. The degree of impact being strong.



58
3. The impact involving a diverse range of activities.
4. The interconnected activity continues for a relatively long duration of time.
The result is that the sexual facet is intertwined with several other aspects of the close relationship.
Love, intimacy, emotions, communication and power relations are examples of these aspects
(McKinney & Sprecher, 1991). McKinney and Sprecher (1991) express the opinion that researchers
in the area of sexuality traditionally ignored the relationship and focused instead on individual
sexuality. But general factors in relationships (for example love and intimacy) are so intertwined
with the construct of sexuality that ignoring these factors produces an impaired understanding of
sexuality. It seems that a close relationship not only provides a feasible context for sexuality to
manifest, but it also provides the researcher with the opportunity to achieve a more holistic picture
of sexuality in its interaction with other relationship aspects. It is exactly this dynamic interaction
between sexuality and other aspects of a close relationship that suggests the appropriateness of
exploring a particular type of sexuality, such as paedophilia, within the context of a close
relationship.
6.5. Sexual desire and pleasure
Sexual behaviour, or sexual expression, has historically and socially been expected to be motivated
by sexual desire and pleasure (Levine, 1995; Seidman 1990). There is a great deal of variation
between different researchers’ conceptions of sexual desire (Regan & Berscheid, 1996). Stewart
(1995) argues that sexual desire is simply one of the appetites, like hunger and thirst. He identified
sexuality as such by means of the organs involved in the sense of satisfaction, and the pleasures at
the core of that satisfaction. It follows that sexual desire could be defined as the desire for contact
with another person’s body, and for the pleasure of the contact. Therefore, pleasure would be the
result of obtaining that sexually desirable phenomenon.
There is an ever-growing body of research, however, that supports a consensus that sexual desire is
a subjective, psychological construct, and not purely a behavioural or physiological event (Regan &
Berscheid, 1996). Levine (1995) suggested such a multidimensional model of sexual desire, and
distinguished three components of sexual desire:
1. The sexual drive forms the biological component mediated by the neuro-endocrine system.
2. The sexual wish refers to the social component reflecting peer and societal expectations.



59
3. The sexual motive relates to the interpersonal component representing a person’s willingness to
engage in sex with a particular person.
It is worth mentioning that the sexual wish, or the social component of sexual desire, has changed
quite dramatically during the twentieth century. According to Seidman (1990), there has been a
sexualisation of love and an eroticisation of sexual activity in Western societies. Sexual desire and
activity have become highly valued as a means of cementing heterosexual relationships. Sex as
pleasure has become appropriated by the discourse of romance and has thus been raised above
previous primitive associations. Sex has acquired a new purpose, and the link between
heterosexuality and reproductive goals has become loosened. Instead, individual fulfilment with the
aid of the close relationship has become the new purpose of sex. In the same manner we can say
that the sexual motive, or the interpersonal component of sexual desire, has been influenced by
society. The consequence is an emphasis on sexual skills and creating pleasure (Jackson & Scott,
1997). Sex is seen as playful and life enhancing where once it was thought of as primitive and
beastly.
However, within the context of close relationships sexual desire and pleasure alone do not suffice as
motivating forces for sexual activity or relationship preservation. Other aspects that are needed in
the close relationship to enjoy satisfying and fulfilling relationships include intimacy, self
disclosure and love (McKinney & Sprecher, 1991).
6.6. Intimacy
There has been little consensus in professional literature on the meaning of intimacy in human
relationships (Monsour, 1992). Rather than trying to decide on a single definition, this discussion
will focus on presenting different perspectives on this concept. Diemer, Mackey and O’Brien (2000)
studied a sample of 108 heterosexual and 108 same-gender couples that had been in relationship for
for an average of 30 years. The results suggested that low interpersonal conflict, a sense of fairness
in the relationship, and expression of affection contributed to a higher sense of psychological
intimacy. In their study, intimacy was defined as the sense of being able to be open and honest in
the relationship in expressing personal thoughts and feelings regarding the self and the relationship.
May (1969) also referred to the open interactive quality of intimacy in a mature sexual relationship.
He named this quality active receiving. Active receiving also refers to a person permitting him- or
herself to be loved while loving the other. This, according to May (1969), indicates a profound



60
awareness of love for another and for oneself. It might be this profound awareness of love Gordon
(1987) referred to when he described intimacy as the experience of an intense feeling between two
people as both individuals exclude experiencing the outside environment.
Ogrodnick (1999) explained intimacy in terms of three different elements: authenticity, self-display
and heartfelt attachment. Sternberg (1998) also explained intimacy by means of the elements it
comprised. He noted that intimacy includes those feelings in a relationship that promote closeness,
bonding and connectedness. His research indicates that intimacy includes at least 10 elements:
1. Desiring to promote the welfare of the loved one.
2. Experiencing happiness with the loved one.
3. Holding the loved one in high regard.
4. Being able to count on the loved one in times of need.
5. Having mutual understanding with the loved one.
6. Sharing oneself and one’s possessions with the loved one.
7. Receiving emotional support from the loved one.
8. Giving emotional support to the loved one.
9. Communicating intimately with the loved one.
10. Valueing the loved one.
Other characteristics of intimacy identified in his study were emotional expressiveness,
unconditional support, shared activities, physical contact and sexual contact (Sternberg, 1998).
Finally, personal disclosure, or self-disclosure, has been highlighted as the essence of intimacy and
the most prominent element of intimacy by many researchers (Jourard, 1971; Monsour, 1992;
Rubin, 1983). Self-disclosure could also be seen as an aspect of close relationships in its own right.
6.7. Self-disclosure
Self-disclosure plays a central role in the development and maintenance of relationships (Collins &
Miller, 1994). Good communication, which is sometimes seen as a prerequisite for self-disclosure,
has also been identified as important to develop and maintain a rewarding close relationship
(Chesney, Blakeney, Cole, & Chan, 1981; Ferroni & Taffee, 1997). One way in which researchers
have explored these processes is by studying the links between self-disclosure and liking within
intimate relationships. Three significant disclosure-liking relations were found:



61
1. People who engage in intimate disclosures tend to be liked more than people who disclose at
lower levels.
2. People disclose more to those they like.
3. People like others as a result of having disclosed to them (Collins & Miller, 1994).
These results suggest that various disclosure-liking effects could be integrated and viewed as
operating together within a dynamic interpersonal system. In congruence with the above, Meleshko
and Alden (1993) found that self-protective behaviour (and, consequently, less disclosure) was
associated with less liking and more discomfort on the part of the partners. Therefore, self
disclosure enhances intimacy as well as overall liking and comfort within the relationship.
Furthermore, self-disclosure was found to contribute to the general level of openness and
connection in the relationships (Meleshko & Alden, 1993).
Within close relationships, it is not only verbal disclosure that counts as self-disclosure. Sexual
activity in itself may also be seen as a form of self-disclosure. According to Reiss (1991), one basis
for the universal importance of sexual activity is indeed self-disclosure. Experiencing intense
physical pleasure in the presence of another person reveals parts of oneself that are not generally
known to others.
6.8. Love
Love and sexuality are intimately connected in our culture and in our culture’s social sciences
(Aron & Aron, 1991). Love also seems to be the motivating factor and most desired and
fundamental aspect of any close relationship, forming the cement that keeps the relationship
together even in times of adversity (Aron & Aron, 1991; Posner, 1992). As love seems to form such
an intricate part of the relationship, it seems warranted to pay special attention to this aspect.
What is love? Most researchers sidestep a definition of love and focus on different categories of
styles, attitudes or behaviour connected to love or a close relationship. The concept of love may be
too polymorphous, complex and subjective to ever be captured in one definition. Therefore, the
purpose of this section is to construct a basis for the understanding of love in the context of a close
relationship by presenting an overview of different definitions and models of love in social
psychological literature.



62
In The Symposium of Plato, Plato first differentiated love from desire (Stewart, 1995). He referred
to Eros as sexual love and identified desire as a concept distinct from love. Posner (1992) explains
this differentiation by noting that love finds a particular person uniquely attractive and desirable,
whereas desire might be more general. Love, more than sexual desire alone, seems to provide
stronger cement for a durable, though not necessarily permanent, relationship; one in which the
partners will protect each other and their offspring.
Love is also viewed as the desire to share the self, the whole self, with another (Houston, 2000).
Love is therefore also in itself a motivation for self-disclosure to take place. There is something
implicitly free and selfless about ‘the sharing of the self’. The selfless quality is also evident in
Scruton’s (quoted in Posner, 1992) comments on love. He believed that in love the other is treated
not as a means to an end, but that the partner’s desires and pleasures are one’s own, and the self’s
desires and pleasures are hopefully also the other’s. Moreover, love makes the other person
irreplaceable and inevitably contradicts the theory of human selfishness (Seligman, 2002). These
selfless concepts of sharing oneself and wanting the best for one’s partner also involves the risk of
exposing oneself to another. This would entail overriding one’s emotional self-protection. Coleman
(1984) understood this phenomenon of emotional surrendering as a value inherent in a person, and
love, therefore, as an awareness of this value that is allowed to dismantle one’s own emotional self
protection from another person. Houston (2000) also viewed love as a freeing and opening of the
self. He explained that the initial impetus for love does not lie in desires, but rather in an
appreciation of the value in a person, which frees us from our tendencies towards emotional self
protection from them.
Other researchers have designed models of love in an attempt to structure this very complex
concept. Berscheid and Walster (1974) proposed a psychological model of love in which love
comprises two major entities: companionate love and passionate love. Companionate love has been
defined as “the affection and tenderness we feel for those with whom our lives are deeply
intertwined” (Hatfield & Rapson, 1993, p. 9) while passionate love has been referred to as “a state
of intense longing for union with another” (Hatfield & Rapson, 1993, p. 5). Sternberg (1986)
explained love in terms of three components by means of his triangular model. He identified these
facets as passion, intimacy and decision (or commitment). Sternberg (1998) views the passion
component largely as the expression of desires and needs (such as self-esteem, nurturance,
dominance and sexual fulfilment). The intimacy component entails feelings of warmth, closeness



63
and connectedness in a relationship. The decision/commitment component refers to the decision to
love one’s partner, as well as the decision to maintain that love.
Lee (1973) conceptualised love in terms of different love styles and proposed that there are six
different styles of love. The three primary styles are Eros – romantic passionate love; Ludus
game-playing love; and Storge – friendship love. The following three styles are derived form the
primary styles: Mania – possessive, dependent love (a compound of Eros and Ludus); Pragma
pragmatic, logical love (a compound of Storge and Ludus); and Agape – selfless, giving love (a
compound of Eros and Storge).
Hazan and Shaver (1987) studied the phenomenon of love from a developmental approach by
applying attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969) to close relationships. It was proposed that the patterns
of attachment that Bowlby (1969) identified might be mirrored in romantic relationships. In their
study, it was found that participants’ descriptions of their current relationships, previous
relationships and childhood memories of the relationships with their caregiver were all consistent
with their primary attachment style.
Love could also be seen as a motivational force. Aron and Aron (1991) emphasised the
motivational side of love, with its goal of closeness with a specific other. They proposed that love is
the constellation of behaviour, cognitions and emotions associated with a desire to enter into or
maintain a close relationship with a specific person. Their self-expansion model (Aron & Aron,
1986) hypothesises that all behaviour is motivated by a desire to increase the self’s potential
efficacy. Thus passion is desired because it is a moment of limitless potential efficacy, or the
connection with a source of such limitless power. The model also holds that the process of
expansion is both highly pleasurable and a motivational goal. Love and sexuality are both favoured
means of self-expansion for several reasons. Firstly, love and sexuality seem available to almost
anyone. Secondly, love and sexuality are often combined in our culture, and are perceived to
provide added expansion opportunities through a single pursuit of forming an intimate relationship
with another person.
Finally, love could also be viewed as an attempt to become a psychologically whole person. Jungian
psychology proposes that all cultures have their own symbols helping their members gain



64
psychological wholeness (also a fundamental expression of the self-expansion motive). Symbols of
sexuality and love are the medium through which women understand their feminine side, and
through which both sexes confront their untamed, wilder sides. Thus sexuality and love are the
present means of gaining wholeness in our society (Aron & Aron, 1991).
The list of definitions may be virtually endless, and as such I will refrain from attempting to provide
a definitive definition of love here. However, it seems imperative to call attention to the limitless
potential that love holds for human beings. Love is the one entity that defies the theory of human
selfishness and enables a person to make commitments that transcends rational gain (Seligman,
2002). It is a vehicle of connection, nurturance and selfless contribution to others. It is therefore not
only a crucial facet in any close relationship, but also essential in understanding and accepting the
self and others. The final close relationship aspect to be discussed is power and control.
6.9. Power and control
The clearest support for the relationship between power and sexuality comes from a comparison of
male and female sexual rights in cultures around the world. The double standard that affords males
greater sexual rights than females can be seen as a reflection of males’ greater political and
economic power in societies around the world (Weeks, 1986). The greater power of males seems to
lead to attempts by them to control the sexuality of women. The relationship of power and sexuality
is also evident in other structures of domination and subordination such as class, gender and race
(Weeks, 1986). Because power has become an inherent property of sexuality, it is also a prominent
and pervasive facet of love and close relationships. Power and control among people who share
intimacy, also called ‘power exertion’ (Szinovacs, 1987) or ‘power in action’ (French & Raven,
1959), have been defined as the degree to which one intentionally regulates the other’s behaviour
(Cartwright, 1959).
Stets (1993) conducted a study in this field. He explored control taking among couples and
addressed three precipitating factors: the stage of the relationship, perspective taking (taking the
view of one’s partner) and the relationship conflict. Control taking was more likely to occur when
an individual’s perspective taking was low and when conflict was high. This implies that people
have a tendency to control their partner when they experience a lack of control over their
environment. Controlling the other restores a view of oneself as being able and competent, and



65
compensates for one’s own perceived lack of control. Control and power thus also serve as
important theoretical constructs in understanding relationships (Stets, 1995).
According to Wilson (1995), control might also be an attribute of love. He suggests that a test of
love would be the ability and willingness to welcome the desire for power over the other, even if
directed to oneself. This achievement, when it occurs with repressed desires and fantasies, would
then be the chief social value of love between equals, because this is what makes justice possible.
Wilson (1995) explains this as follow:
I cannot love X without some measure of power over X, wanting to possess X in some
sense, wanting X to depend on me. The basic reason for this is simple: if I love X, then by
definition I desire X, delight in some association with X, and want to get as much out of X
as possible. So to achieve this I must also want X to be available for me, and to be so
controlled or possessed by me that I get what I want out of X. (p. 62)
According to Wilson (1995), power is therefore a constituent of love. Power is present in a
relationship to the degree that you desire the complete and utter love and possession of your lover,
and knowing that you have the ability to elicit and rely on this. It also implies the feeling that you
are in his or her power and possession. This resembles the feeling a child has toward his or her
parents. Wilson (1995) further notes that the focus should not be on the kind or amount of power
used. We should rather recognise the interactions with X as based on:
1. Bilateral negotiation and mutual understanding (communication, sharing).
2. The result of unilateral judgement and guess work (idea of how best to manage each other).
But why do some relationships of power result in exploitation or abuse, whereas so many others
result in compassion? Mills and Clark (1982) note that there are different parameters for various
kinds of relationships that impact on how power is distributed within a specific relationship.
Relationships that contain power imbalances can be studied from within both professional and
intimate settings. Therefore, relational context becomes an important factor. A person may have a
power advantage or disadvantage in a relationship with another person depending on the context.
Mills and Clark (1982) propose that these types of relationships, in which power imbalances occur,
need to be assessed in two ways. Firstly, reflection is needed to discern the presence of various
types of power advantage or power disadvantage for each individual. Some variables worth
considering in this regard are age, gender, sexual orientation, race, cultural background, role, and



66
access to information, as well as life circumstance. Secondly, additional assessment is needed to
determine risk factors to each party in the relationship with regard to the potential for power abuse.
Mills and Clark (1982) assert in this theory that both the person in the powerful position, and the
person in the disadvantaged role, are capable of manipulative use of the power in a relationship.
They further contend that there may be contextual and relational elements, such as trust, naivety,
preoccupying stress or lack of experience that make a person vulnerable to being manipulated,
abused or exploited.
6.10. Conclusion
This chapter identified and discussed several aspects of close relationships. As an introduction,
courtship was presented. The central aspects of close relationships were identified as sexuality,
sexual desire, pleasure, intimacy, self-disclosure, love, and power and control. Although these were
presented as individual aspects of close relationships, it is acknowledged that they are in fact highly
interrelated, and dynamically interwoven to form the concept of close relationships. In the
following section it will be shown how the concept of close relationships can be used to shed new
light on the phenomenon of paedophilia.



67
7. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF PAEDO-RELATIONSHIPS
7.1. Introduction
This chapter will present a narrative description of three men’s experiences and constructs of paedo
relationships. The participants were interviewed in an attempt to explore their world of close
relationships with children. The data from the interviews was positioned in the framework of close
relationships and then compared to universal (or normative) ideas and constructs of close
relationships. Concepts taken from the theory of close relationships, such as sexuality (including
sexual activities, sexual orientation and sexual desire), love, self-disclosure, and control and power,
were predominantly used to organise the emerging themes. In addition, in keeping with
phenomenological thinking, the data itself was interrogated for further themes that related to close
relationships. The emerging themes included courtship, mutual engagement, communication and
pleasure, and were incorporated into the description.
The participants all experienced intimate relationships, without physical violence or coercion, with
children between 8 and 11 years of age. At the time of interviewing they were all convicted and
incarcerated ‘child sex offenders’. Two of the participants (both Afrikaans speaking) were married
and involved in heterosexual relationships, and the third participant (English speaking) had been
involved with adult men and defined himself as homosexual.
As two of the participants were Afrikaans speaking, direct quotations from these two participants
have been translated to English for the reader. It has to be accepted that inevitably, the meaning
might have been altered through the translation. As such, the original text has also been included in
the main part of this study (in italics). Where names appear in the text, pseudonyms were used.
7.2. Courtship behaviour
The main objective of courtship behaviour is to elicit an affectionate response from the love object
(Givens, 1978).
Two of the participants established contact with the children by assuming the role of the protector
or caring figure during the courtship stage. Safety and protection might be enticing qualities for
most children. The demonstration of protection and caring thus formed part of the participants’



68
courtship behaviour. This relates to the childcare-related non-verbal signs that govern courtship
behaviour (Givens, 1978). Both these participants met children at public venues including
swimming pools, an ice-skating rink, and school play grounds. One participant who met a girl at a
swimming pool stated:
P: The nanny left them there all by themselves – no mother or father, nobody.
This implies that the girl was abandoned. He took care of her, protected her for the day, and bought
her “cold drinks and sweets”. His account of what happened portrays him in an innocent, almost
honourable, light. He stressed the fact that no parents were present, implying possibly tragic
negligence. This participant might have projected his own feelings of rejection and alienation
during childhood onto this situation. More importantly, however, the caring facet of courtship
behaviour was employed here to make himself acceptable to the love object.
The other participant went to school playgrounds to make contact with potential love objects:
P: I watch them where they play, and what time. Everyday I see them play there 10 o’ clock; and 11 o’clock they
are gone. So, I would approach them, go and sit amongst them, and light a cigarette – I smoked then – and just
watch what they do ... And when they fight with each other, I would make them think I am almost like a father
and say: “Don’t do that.” Then I would take the one [girl] that got hurt, aside, and say that it is “all right” and
“don’t worry”, and that she should come and sit with me. I was very sly.
P: Ek hou hulle dop waar hulle speel, watter tyd. Elke dag sien ek maar hulle speel mos elke dag 10 o’clock dan
is hulle daar; en 11 o’clock dan is hulle weg. Dan sou ek vir hulle so benader het en ek sou net daar gaan sit by
hulle, en my ’n cigarette opgesteek het – die tyd wat ek gerook het – en gekyk het wat maak hulle. En dit is nie
altyd wat hulle met mekaar stry nie, dan sou ek nou ’n idee in hulle in plaas dat ek maar daar is amper soos ’n
pa, en sê: “moenie die doen nie.” Dan sou ek die enetjie wat nou seergekry het of geslaan gewees het na my toe
nader bring. En as dit nou ’n meisiekind is sou ek saam met haar praat en sê daai is “all right” en “moenie
worry nie kom sit hier by my”. En so het ek nou saam met haar gepraat. Ek was baie skelm gewees.
This participant’s account displays a sense of ritual: a specific time, and specific sequence of events.
Givens (1978) also noted this ritualised sequence to courtship. Again comforting and protecting is
used as courtship behaviour. The physical action of comforting might also lead to more sexual
contact, such as fondling. This participant was very aware of being opportunistic and refers to
himself as sly. He found it relatively easy to blend in with children and to remain unobtrusive.
Blending in with the children might have given him a sense of belonging.



69
In public places the love object is likely to be a stranger. The courtship behaviour may thus be more
overt and direct than it would be amongst family and friends. The third participant accounted how
he had planned the time, place and manner to make contact with his love object. This planning
might have heightened his anticipation and increased the excitement. The preparation ritual could
play a significant role in the whole sexual experience. Suspense, planning, secrecy and the fear of
being caught all add to the anticipatory excitement and physical arousal characteristic of the
courtship phase.
P: And one day, as the children played in the yard, a little devil would tell me: “Try that child out.” Then I
would tell her: “Lisa, come here.” When she comes closer I tell her: “Here’s your 2 bob, go and buy
sweets for yourself.” My two sons would see this and ask: “Daddy where is mine?” Then I tell them: “Nai,
I will give you just now, but you must wait until Lisa comes back, then daddy will give you.” Their
mother sleeps, my wife sleeps and her [Lisa’s] mother is at work.
As Lisa comes back I tell my sons: “Right, there is your 2 bob, and 2 bob for you, and now you go and
buy yourself some sweets.” Then I tell Lisa to come here. Then I kiss her ...
P: En eendag, ... soos die kinders speel hier in die jard ... dan loop daar sommer ’n duiweltjie hier in my
kop in: try die kind uit. Dan sê ek vir haar: “Lisa kom hierso.” Dan kom sy. Dan sê ek vir haar: “Daar’s
jou two bob gat koop vir jou lekkers”. My twee seuns sien dit en vra:“Daddy waar is myne?” Dan sê ek:
“Nai, ek gaan vir julle nou gee, maar julle moet wag dat Lisa eerste winkel toe gaan as Lisa terugkom
dan gee daddy vir julle twee.” Die ma slaap, my vrou slaap, en die kind se ma is nou in die werk in.
Soos Lisa terugkom ... dan sê ek vir my twee seuns: “Right, daar is ’n two bob vir jou en ’n two bob vir
jou, nou gaan koop julle twee weer vir julle lekkers.” Nou wat hulle nou weg is nou sê ek vir Lisa: “Kyk
ek, mmm kom hierso.” Nou soen ek vir haar...
All the participants reported planning contact with their love object in such a way as to keep this ‘a
secret’ from the world. The importance of secrecy required planning, which lead to anticipation and
excitement.
It is important to note that what is referred to as courtship behaviour in the current study, is termed
grooming (Wyre, 1990) in most victimologist literature. This entails the first stage of planning and
attempting to befriend the child. It is said to be a strategic approach to gaining power over the child
(Elloitt, Browne, & Kilcoyne, 1995). As a grooming activity (sometimes also referred to as
seduction (Howitt, 1995)), this behaviour is perceived to entail manipulation and coercion, as
implied by the terms victim and offender. However, when compared to normative courtship
dynamics, which include elements such as planning, manipulation of events and impressions (in
order to lay the foundation for more intimate selecting), it becomes less ‘criminal’.



70
7.3. Constructing a close relationship
The participants were asked how they view a normal and an ideal relationship. The core values in a
normal, close relationship, as identified by the participants, include protection, caring, special
feelings, being understood, loyalty and a sense of enjoyment with another. These are all elements
commonly found in the descriptions of close relationships.
When discussing the ideal relationship, the participants’ values and needs became apparent.
Honesty, sharing, trust, loyalty and mutual understanding appeared to be most important. These
values might be significant in their sexual preference for children:
P: What I expect from a woman, is she must be honest with me. She must be straight with me. If she
maybe has a problem, she must not hide it from me. She must be able to share it with me.
P: Wat ek verwag van die vrou, ek verwag sy moet eerlik is saam met my. Sy moet opreg is saam met my.
Sy moet as sy miskien probleem het, sy moet nie haar problems wegsteek nie. Sy moet dit kan deel saam
met my.
P: Just that I can have trust in the person with whom I have a relationship – that I can trust her with
everything.
P: Net die feit dat ek vertroue kan het in die persoon met wie ek ’n verhouding het – dat ek haar kan
vertrou met alles.
P: A romantic relationship, you must be able to understand each other and enjoy each other. Between a
man and wife, I did not have good examples, really ... How a man behaves, whar a woman must do right.
So I struggle to understand how exactly a real relationship should be.
P: ’n Romantiese verhouding, ’n mens moet mekaar verstaan, mekaar geniet. Tussen ’n man en vrou vir
my was daar nie ’n goeie voorbeeld gewees nie so ek sukkel maar regtigwaar om te verstaan wat is ’n
egte en hoe ’n verhouding moet wees ek sukkel regtigwaar ... Hoe moet ’n man hom gedra wat moet ’n
vrou reg doen.
P: Just to understand me, that is all, just to understand.



71
P: Net om my te verstaan, dis maar al net om te verstaan.
It appears that the participants found it easier to trust a child than an adult, and easier to believe that
children could be honest and loyal. They also reported feeling accepted and understood, which may
well be a reflection of a child’s ability to readily accept a person for who they are. Such acceptance
may create a sense of belonging, something with which all three participants reported struggling
with and craving throughout their lives. The participants generally gave the impression that their
values of honesty, trust and loyalty would have a better chance of being honoured in a paedo
relationship, than in an adult sexual relationship. The attribution of innocence to the love object was
also highly valued by all three participants. They possibly believe that innocence would invariably
guarantee more trust and loyalty in a relationship. The innocence of the child may endow the paedo
relationship with a safer and more trustworthy space than would be found in an adult-adult
relationship.
However, the need for trust, loyalty and honesty is not something the participants readily
reciprocated. As such there is tension between the participants’ emotional expectations of
relationships and their own behaviour. For example, one participant stated that he would only be
open with his young partner if she was open towards him. Even then, he struggled to really be open
with her. This seems to be a childlike perspective on a relationship: This is what I want, but I am
not able (or willing) to give it in return. Another childlike feature, which might compensate for the
above, is a sense of over-indulgence in the participants’ construct of the ideal relationship:
P: I will do anything in a relationship with a young boy I will do anything for him – if he wants to go to the
moon I will try and arrange it for him. That’s my fantasy with a young kid. I’ll do anything for him.
The participants may feel they give to their love objects in a material manner that which they
struggle to give in the emotional arena.
7.4. Sexuality in close relationships
7.4.1. Sexual activities
In general, sexual activities consisted of kissing, licking, fondling private parts and masturbating.
Despite wanting to, all three the participant denied having had intercourse with any of their love
objects. Their reasons included that it might traumatise the youngster, it might physically hurt the
girls and that it would be ‘wrong’. As will be seen later (in section 7.4.4.), the participants found



72
another source to fulfil their need for sex. In close relationships the ability to adapt (or refrain from)
sexual activities to suit your partner may indicate respect, caring and the surrender of personal
wants. It entails an act of compromise and selflessness. However, it could also be argued that the
motivating factor for such behaviour could be the fear of getting into trouble, hurting the love object
or being rejected. Abstaining from sex in the relationships might also serve other functions, for
example to keep the love object innocent and desirable.
As the participants were the adults in their paedo-relationship and physically bigger and stronger
than their love objects, one can assume that they regulated sexual activities. However, all three
participants reported enjoying the idea that their love objects experienced sexual pleasure.
P: I masturbate while I’m fondling him – then he gets high, I get at the same time – it was the same with the
girls.
This participant talked about reaching orgasm at the same time as the boy and girl. He refers to this
as something quite accidental, but recurring. He would only reach orgasm when the child did. This
is related to the perception that the child could, and did, initiate sexual activity or seduction.
P: Sometimes I use to sleep naked but whenever the daughter did something wrong the mother blamed the
boys. One night I woke up. I had no clothes on – the eldest boy climbed in my bed. I did not open my eyes.
Then I felt his hand on me between my legs.
This participant seemed to enjoy (and found it erotic) to view himself in the passive and innocent
role. He slept in the nude, maybe hoping and waiting for something to happen. His desire to fulfil
his sexual fantasy, of being seduced by the boy, may have compelled him to create situations with a
high probability of that happening. To be the passive partner in sexual engagement (or to be
seduced) may also be an important aspect in the participant’s management of anxiety and guilt. As
such, he does not view himself guilty of seducing or manipulating the boy, but rather responsible
for creating an opportunity for sexual activity. Another participant reported that young girls
approached him on a daily basis for sexual pleasures. Although he declined to have sex with them
when they were “too young”, he seemed proud that they appeared to be the sexual aggressors in his
experience. The participants seemed to feel flattered and has gained a sense of innocence through
these experiences.
There was also evidence of unusual sexual behaviour. One participant especially enjoyed licking his
love object. As a child he had to lick his father’s feet. This might have had a very significant impact



73
on his construct of the erotic. He did not seem to understand this desire, but seemed to acknowledge
it was unusual.
P: Then I think: If I were with that woman I would lick her from head to toe. I mean, it is a desire in me, I
don’t know why.
P: Dan dink ek as ek nou by daai vrou is dan lek ek haar van toon tot kop. Ek, ek meen dit is ’n desire in my, ek
weet nie hoekom nie.
Inherent in sexual activity is a sense of self-disclosure and consequent vulnerability (Reiss, 1991).
During sexual activity, a part of the self is expressed and seen that is not generally revealed to the
rest of the world. The participants may have experienced a sense of relief in being able to share
their normally hidden paedosexuality. Two of the participants reported feeling understood by their
love objects; something they did not experience with other people in their lives. It is suggested that
the sexual disclosure they shared with their love objects allowed them to reveal themselves without
holding back. Moreover, their perception of being seduced by their love objects may represent the
ultimate in acceptance. A very intimate space may be created when the participant feels accepted
and loved. Sharing intense sexual pleasure, or observing that experience in the love object, results
in intimacy through the act of self-disclosure and acceptance. The intimacy is also amplified, as
both persons become vulnerable to the others’ seduction.
This notion of vulnerability highlights the risk involved in sexual disclosure. The primary risk
involves being rejected by the love object. The rejection would not only be directed at the sexual act,
but as sexuality is so intertwined with the sense of self and identity (Dollimore, 1991), it would also
result in a rejection of that person. As such, the participants may experience total rejection in adult
adult relationships, while experiencing personal and sexual acceptance in adult-child relationships.
7.4.2. Pleasure
The pleasure associated with sexual activity and close relationships has become highly valued
during the twentieth century (Seidman, 1990). The participants, however, did not focus solely on
the sexual components of the relationship as being responsible for their pleasure. Pleasure was
gained through different components of the relationship. Some of these components have been
identified as the excitement of secrecy, a feeling of power and observing the pleasure experienced
by the love object.



74
P: For me it kind of felt great. I felt a bit excited, because I knew the child would not tell.
P: Vir my het dit nogal kwaai gevoel. Vir my bietjie opwindend laat voel, want because ek het geweet, die kind
sal nie nog sê nie.
The concept of secrecy seemed to have caused heightened sexual arousal for the participant. In
other words, the sense of being naughty and secretive may induce sexual hyper-arousal. This idea
will be discussed in a following section (8.2.1.). The statement above also proves the sense of
control or power to keep the love object silent.
Pleasure was also gained through watching the love object experience pleasure:
P: The pleasure from the child, I would say, she enjoyed it because she would tell me what to do, in what
position to lay, what she wanted to do ... It think she got pleasure from touching me, and the things she
fantasised about.
P: Die plesier van die kind af sou ek sê dat sy het dit geniet omdat sy vir my sou sê wat om te doen, om watter
posisie om te lê, en wat sy wil aanvang. Ek dink sy het genot daaruit gekry om aan my te gevat het en dinge wat
sy miskien oor gefantaseer het.
The participant believed he gave the girl an opportunity to fulfil her fantasies. He might have
projected his own need for fulfilling his fantasies on his love object. However, the idea of her
experiencing pleasure in turn provided him pleasure.
7.4.3. Mutual engagement
Alcoff (1998) noted that sexual expression should not be judged in terms of consent – as that would
imply that sexual activity is a purely contractual relationship. It should rather be seen as a mutual
engagement. Consent implies a verbal agreement, whereas mutual engagement refers to a more
implicit understanding of what both persons in the relationship desire.
It emerged from the data that all three the participants experienced a sense of mutual engagement
with their young partners during sexual activity. However, the participants termed this sense of
mutual engagement as consent. As such, their construct of consent differed slightly from universal
constructs. They predominantly construed consent as non-verbal agreement. As such, physically
engaging in sexual activity would represent giving ‘consent’. All of the participants agreed that it
was important for the child to consent to the sexual activities in the relationship. The following



75
statements demonstrate how the participants perceived mutual engagement, which they termed
consent, from their love objects:
P: In a sexual relationship you got to get consent, you must be willing to do it.
P: Like one time I was lying naked in bed and he popped into the bed and he started, he saw and feel I was naked
so automatically if he feels something and he takes off his pajamas and lay next to me: he is saying yes.
P: She was at all times game, at all times.
P: Sy was at all times game, at all times.
P: I never went against a child’s will.
P: Ek het nooit teen ’n kind se wil gegaan nie.
P: Then I said: “What did you say?” No she wants to – then she shows me: No, what you showed me.
P: Dan sê ek: “Wat sê jy?” Nee sy wil – dan wys sy vir my: Nei jy het vir my gewys.
As such they constructed attaining consent as making sure that the child was ‘game’, not going
against the love object’s will, asking or requesting verbal consent, or the love object initiating the
sexual behaviour. The participants thus believed that they had, in these situations, a mutual
agreement with their love objects to sexual activity. Further scenarios supporting the belief that
their sexual activities were based on mutual agreement were recounted. For example, one
participant’s love object told him he “loved what was going on”; another’s love object was “always
game” for sexual activities; and the last participant’s love object knowingly “seduced” him by
doing a suggestive African dance for him. Over and above the scenarios of mutual agreement
mentioned, all three believed that, at times, their love objects initiated the sexual activities. Some of
the scenarios follow:
P: Yes, she enjoyed it. I told her once that we should maybe stop a bit, because people could maybe find out
about us.
P: Ja, sy het dit geniet. Ek het al vir haar gesê kyk hier die dinge van ons twee moet ’n bietjie ophou want
because mense gat begin te miskien uitvinde van ons.



76
P: Anne once did an African dance she saw on TV. She stands with her legs wide apart moving her lower body.
Then I show her with my eyes, there, underneath. Then she laughs and throws her lower body again. Then I
would think: O, you know what you are busy with.
P: Anne doen eenkeer ’n dans een van die African danse wat sy gesien het op die TV. Dan staan sy wydsbene dan
beweeg sy haar onderlyfie so. Nou wys ek haar so met die oë daaronder en sy lag en sy gooi haar onderlyfie, nou
dink ek, jy o hier jy weet waarmee jy deurmekaar is.
P: When she takes the baby, she knows I am going to play with the baby, but not really with the baby. Now she
holds the baby, so that I can play with it, but she presses her breasts against the baby so that I can play with the
breasts. There are people around us. We were sly. That’s the way we were.
P: Nou as sy die baba vat dan staan sy nou met die baba. Nou sy weet ek gaan speel met die baba, but, sy weet ek
gaan nie eintlik speel met die baba nie. Nou hou sy die baba, dan speel ek [met] die baba, but dan druk sy haar
borste [teen die baba], because ek wil met die borste speel. Daar’s nou mense rondom ons, dit kos skelm wees.
Nou so was ek en sy nou weer, verstaan mevrou.
P: Every afternoon 4 o’clock, half past three, she came. Then she wanted to do this, and then I just did it ...
P: En elke middag 4 uur half past three het sy nog gekom en dan wil sy nou so gemaak het en ek het nou maar
net dit gedoen ...
From these scenarios it seems as if the participants, at times, viewed themselves as the passives in
the sexual activities – as if they were being seduced by their love objects. In the experience of the
participants the power relation between adult and child is reversed. In their eyes, the child becomes
the sexual aggressor and they become the sexual passives. It seems as if there is a need to feel
vulnerable and dominated by the child, and that this reversal of power is experienced as extremely
erotic. The child is viewed as the innocent party and being seduced by the innocent may provide the
sanctioning needed for the participants to endure, and deal with, their own sexual behaviour.
An intrinsic problem of mutual engagement (and therefore non-verbal indications of consent) is that
one’s own sexual desire (and attraction) is often projected onto the love object. Non-verbal signs of
affection from the love object may be wrongly interpreted as sexual advances (Harvey & Weber,
2002). This proves the idea of mutual engagement to be an unreliable indicator of consent in
relationships where an inherent power imbalance is present.



77
7.4.4. Sexual orientation
The three participants claimed to have a sexual preference for children. As mentioned above, the
participants created other ways to fulfil their need for sex, as they refrained from having sex with
the children. One participant claimed he ‘used’ his wife for sex. Another participant mentioned he
used adult men for sex (and financial gain). The third mentioned that he had relationships with adult
women, purely for the purpose of having intercourse. It seems as if all three participants found a
way of fulfilling their need for sex outside of the paedo-relationship. This made it possible to keep
their desire for sex from disrupting the relationship with their love object. More importantly, all the
participants viewed adult-adult relationhips as somehow less fulfilling than a paedo-relationship.
Two participants mentioned that adult-adult relationhips were “just for sex”. These statements
reduce an adult-adult relationship to a mere sexual transaction, and imply that most of the valuable
elements of a loving relationship were lacking.
P: To tell you the truth, a relationship with my age group was just sexual. It was just about sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.
For me it was just about going to bed, really.
P: Om die waarheid te sê ’n verhouding met ’n, met my ouderdomsgroep was maar net seksueel. Die dinge het
maar net gegaan om seks seks seks seks seks. Vir my was dit net kooi toe regtigwaar.
This participant stated that his relationship with a young girl meant much more to him than the
simple satisfaction of a need. In this way he differentiated between romantic relationships (with
young girls) and relationships only for the purpose of having sex (with adult women). He stated that
he did not trust adult women, and found loyalty, trust and understanding primarily in a paedo
relationship. He also admitted fantasising about his young love object, even while having sex with
his wife, and that he was still currently fantasising about her.
As mentioned, the participants clearly stated that their sexual orientations were toward children.
Although it was made clear that the interviews were confidential, two participants became evasive
when asked to confirm the exact ages of the children they were attracted to. Irregularities and
contradictions appeared in their answers. These contradictions are dicussed later (see 8.4).
P: Lets put it this way – I was with younger people more than with men. In those years I use to just organise
money for myself by going with men and all that. In a way I prefer young boys.



78
P: OK, speaking now, maybe 13 is too young. Yes I don’t think I will be able to do it with that child, let’s make
it a bit older. A few years ago, they were younger, say 10.
P: OK soos ek nou sê, nou dan is 13 miskien nog te jonk. Ja ek sal nie met daai kind kan nie. Kom ons maak
dit ’n bietjie ouer. Paar jaar gelede, is hulle ’n jonger gewees, ... sê 10.
The general ages of attraction ranged between 6 and 13. Two of the participants admitted to being
attracted to children of 6 to 8 years in newspapers and on television.
P: When I see children on TV, it seems to me there is still a desire to go there, and that is dangerous ... I’m
talking about 6, 7 years old, 8, yes it stays around that age group.
P: As ek kinders op die TV sien dan lyk dit vir my daar is nog altyd ’n begeerte om daar uit te kom en dit is
gevaarlik. Ek praat van 6, 7 jaar oud 8 ja dit bly net in daai ouderdom.
7.4.5. Sexual desire
Sexual desire is increasingly seen as a subjective, psychological construct in contrast to the
historical belief that sexual desire should be seen as a physiological and behavioural event (Regan
& Berscheid, 1996). Therefore, focus was not only given to physical elements and visual stimuli
that may cause sexual attraction, but also to more implicit elements that might have played a part in
sexual desire. Through analysis of the data, two themes emerged regarding sexual desire, namely
physical attraction and the eroticisation of innocence.
7.4.5.1. Eroticism and physical attraction
The participants found children erotic in tight fitting clothes, underwear and nightwear. The shape
of the sex organs, which would be visible in tight fitting clothes such as swimwear, was also found
to be erotic.
P: I think with boys – his body – when he puts a Speedo on – when I walk past him all I see is his front parts. The
Speedos for boys are very tight and you can see the shape of everything and they draw much attention.
P: Everything about her was attractive to me.
P: Alles van haar was aantreklik vir my.
P: When you buy the Argus, then they have Edgards and Ackermans ads where, to be honest, they sometimes
show you women too. Then they also show nighties where you can see the child, but you cannot estimate the age.
But as I say, when I see the breasts, so nice and small, then my mind wonders too.



79
P: As jy die Argus koop dan wys hulle mos miskien nou so die Edgars en Ackermans se klere wat hulle mos nou
verkoop, om eerlik te wees, nou wys hulle mos sometimes die vrou ook. Dan hulle wys mos nighties waarin jy kan
mos sien ... as ’n kind miskien nou ... jy kan mos nie daarin ’n ouderdom skat nie ... Maar as ek nou kom kry om
te sê daai kind sê jy kyk al na borste... is so lekker kleintjies dan trek my mind ook.
Developing breasts, as well as the absence of breasts, were considered erotic by the participants.
Not only did it imply a connection with innocence and childhood, it was also found stimulating by
the participant with a homosexual orientation. One participant associated breasts with his mother.
P: What I thought about breasts, I thought milk comes out of it. You just drink from it. That is what I learnt from
my mother: that breasts are for milk, not for any other purpose.
P: Wat ek aan borste gedink het dink ek aan daar kom melk uit. Jy drink maar net daaraan. Dit is wat ek van my
ma afgeleer het, borste is daar vir melk. Dit is nie vir ’n ander doel daar nie.
Furthermore, the idea of his mother might have caused him anxiety, as there were still unresolved
issues around her death or disappearance.
7.4.5.2. Attracted to innocence
It seems as if the participants attached different values to innocence. One common idea was that
innocence is erotic and exciting. This supports the suggestion that Western culture has sexualised
the child, and that the innocent child has, to some extent, been eroticised (Kincaid, 1993). The
participants’ construct of innocence entailed the following concepts: virginity, cleanliness, purity,
naivety and ‘not knowing anything’.
As a virgin, the child is seen as clean and untouched, not yet contaminated by the world:
P: Then I feel, she is still pure child, she has never had sex with a man, in other words she is still a pure virgin!
P: Dan voel ek, die is nog skone kind, sy het nog nooit regtig met ’n man seksuele gehad nie, met ander woorde
sy is ’n pure virgin!
The fact that the child may be naïve and new to sexual experiences seemed to excite all the
participants:



80
P: ... it makes you feel excited.
P: ... dit laat jou opgewonde voel.
P: I see a child as a person, he is still small and don’t know what’s coming his way ...
As the child may be unaware of ‘what is coming’, the participants took on the role of the ‘teacher’:
P: Yes, somebody very innocent, very, very innocent, that I could learn things to, new things just from me.
P: Ja, iemand baie onskuldig ... baie baie onskuldig. Wat ek nou die dinge kan wysmaak en sê dit nou net nuut
van my af.
It seems as if the child is viewed as a ‘blank slate’ that the participant may fill with his own
knowledge and views. To be the one who teaches the love object ‘all there is to know’ implies
control over the love object. The control creates a sense of safety in the relationship and is
congruent with participants’ reported difficulties with trust in close relationships. The more control
you have, the less you need to trust your loved one. One participant reported that he harboured
anger towards adult women. For him the innocent child was not part of the ‘evil’ race of untruthful
women. Innocence for him, especially, may have represented safety in the love object.
It is interesting that, although the participants were attracted to the innocence in their love objects,
the children were also not seen as completely innocent. The girls and boys seemed to come across
as partially ‘innocent’, and by implication partially experienced in sexual behaviour. In other words,
sexual experience decreased the perceived innocence of a love object. Moreover, the participants
could have been particularly attracted to the ‘inarticulate’ nature of child sexuality.
P: There were a few girls, older than 10 years, they already knew a lot of things about sex. They would pull down
their own pants and tell me to come and do the thing with them. There was one who asked me to put my penis
into her body. I told her she was too young.
P: ... daar is ’n paar, hoe kan ek sê anderkant 10 jaar oud, wat ook al baie dinge geweet al van seks wat ook al.
Hulle broeke self afgetrek het en gesê het [ek moet] kom en die ding doen – daar’s al een wat al vir my gevra het
om my penis in haar liggaam in te druk. Ek het vir haar gesê nee jy is nog te klein.



81
The above assertion sketches a less innocent image of the girls. The participant sees himself as
‘protector’. This participant may have experienced young girls as innocent in the ways of the heart,
enabling him to trust them; being less innocent in sexual matters enabled him to enjoy sexual
activities with girls. Another participant viewed children as partially innocent:
P: ... I’ll say 50-50 on the innocent part, let’s get that straight.
Viewing a child as partially innocent but sexually experienced make it possible to receive consent
from the child and as well as experience the eroticism of being in a relationship with the innocent
love object at the same time.
As Levine (1995) noted, the social component to sexual desire (peer and societal expectations) has
changed and loosened during the last century and may have less impact on individual choice of
sexual expression. Creating pleasure has become a likely goal in sexual activity (Jackson & Scott,
1997) as well as individual fulfilment (relating to the sexual motive (Levine, 1995)) and the need
for close relationships. As such, individual preference of sexual expression has increased, while the
influence of social norms on sexual expression has decreased. This could provide some clue as to
how the paedophile maintains his sexual desire to be with young love objects, and chooses them as
partners, in direct conflict to societal norms and standards.
7.5. Love
All three participants demonstrated a philosophical view in their construct of love. It seemed as if
the participants experienced love as something special that they struggled to articulate. However,
their constructs remained simple and unsophisticated, in contradiction to the complicated nature of
the constructs mentioned in academic literature (and discussed in section 6.8.). The following
concepts were embedded in their constructs of love: giving, exchange, selflessness, protection and
honouring manly duties.
Two of the participants referred to texts from the Bible and their relationship with God to help
explain and articulate what love is:



82
P: Love is a precious thing – you must know how to show love to other people if you want it. Love is not only
physical. Love thy neighbours as yourself that’s what it really means.
This construct refers to the exchange of love, pointing out that love entails a two-way dynamic. The
participant’s explanation of love coincides with May’s (1969) sense of intimacy in a mature sexual
relationship: loving the other while permitting oneself to be loved. The participant ended his
explanation with a reference to the Bible. He might be referring to a selfless, giving love, the kind
that Lee (1973) referred to as ‘Agape’. This view of love is even more notable in the following
passage:
P: And now that I am older, since I have the Lord in my life, now I really know what love is. The Word of the
Lord came to teach me what it is to love and what love entails: Love is to give what you are able to give.
P: En nou wat ek groot is nou weet ek, kan ek sê, vandat ek die Here in my lewe in het weet ek rêrigwaar wat is
liefde. Die Woord van die Here het eintlik vir my kom leer wat dit is om lief te hê en wat behels liefde alles:
Liefde is om te gee kan ek sê wat jy in staat is om te gee.
This participant’s relationship with God played an integral part in his understanding of love. In this
construct the focus is on giving without expecting anything in return. “To give what you are able to
give” seems to be a realistic approach to giving. In both of the above constructs there is a theme of
giving and sharing, however, the one represents a dynamic exchange, whereas the other one
represents a selfless giving. The unconditional giving is also present in the following explanation:
P: [the love object] ... would maybe not ask for it, but I would do it for her. I showed love to her, without
realising it. I came to learn it here in prison, that what I did was actually love that I showed her. I did not even
realise it. I know I love that child, and I still love her.
P: [The love-object] ... sou miskien nie vra daarvoor nie of wat nie, dan sal ek dit vir haar doen. Dan het ek
weer sonder om te weet bewys liefde aan haar, jy sien. Ek het dit nou kom vind hier in die tronk dit wat ek
gedoen het is eintlik liefde wat ek vir daai kind gewys het. Ek het dit nie eers besef nie. Ek weet ek is lief vir daai
kind ek is nou nog lief vir haar.
The idea of protecting and providing for the love object is demonstrated in the following construct
of love:
P: Love for me is to care for a woman. I must do my manly duties for her ... to protect Lisa [the love object]
where I can.



83
P: Liefde vir my is, ek moet omgee vir ’n vrou. Ek moet my manlike pligte moet kan doen vir haar ...om vir Lisa
[the love object] te beskerm waar ek kan ...
This participant viewed himself as the protector and provider in a loving relationship and this is
how he defined and expressed his love. This relates to Posner’s (1992) account of love wherein the
male desires to protect the female. The participant explained ‘manly responsibilities’ as a) his
fatherly responsibilities and b) to support his partner in “every little thing”. He painted a very
(almost excessively) accommodating role that he believed should be played by him in a close
relationship. In reality he might struggle to live up to this idealised role, which could in turn cause
inner conflict. Although this reflects the specific participant’s construct of love, it also provides an
account of what this participant’s sense of masculinity or manliness may be. This is discussed in
section 7.7.
Another participant referred to his children as an example of perfect love:
P: My perfect love is my children [...] The love I have for them and they for me.
P: My perfekte liefde is my kinders [...] Die liefde wat ek vir hulle het en hulle vir my het.
The fact that his construct of ideal love relates to the love you give and receive from your children
opens up the discourse of child love – a seemingly unconditional love. The participant may have
romanticised and sexualised child love. As such, his definition of ideal love made it possible for this
participant to experience ideal love with a love object: a child.
7.6. Communication and self-disclosure
Communication and self-disclosure have been identified as important factors in developing and
maintaining meaningful close relationships (Chesney et al., 1981; Ferroni & Taffee, 1997). All the
participants in this study maintained that they valued the communication between them and their
love objects. Their constructs of communication in the relationships entailed the sharing of future
dreams, disclosing feelings, one-way communication, two-way communication, openness, honesty
and physical openness. In return, two of the participants experienced closeness, and felt understood
and heard as a result of the communication in the relationships.



84
One participant shared his future dreams with his love object in the form of one-way
communication:
P: Then I tell her: “Lisa, you are still small.” Because I always told her: “You watch, you have to grow, because I
want to make you my wife.” Then I tell her: “You are my wife, understand.”
P: Dan sê ek vir haar: “Sien Lisa, jy is nog klein man.” Want ek het haar altyd gesê: “Jy watch jy moet groei, jy
moet groei want because ek wil jou my vrou maak.” Dan sê ek vir haar: “Jy is my vrou verstaan.”
This participant wanted his love object to “grow older” and become his wife. He shared these
dreams almost in a childlike manner; telling her how things should be, rather than sharing his
dreams with her in a reciprocal fashion. He incorporated his love object into a very traditional
romantic ideal, namely his “wife” (although in reality he was already married). The sharing of
dreams also enhances intimacy in the relationship (Monsour, 1992). The participant recognised that
Lisa said “yes” to everything. It is possible that she might have said yes to anything, as she did not
fully comprehend what was asked of her. However, this did not seem to deter the participant. It
might have been enough for him to feel that he could disclose in the relationship, without needing
his partner to reciprocate.
Communication also consisted of supportive listening:
P: ... every time he needed someone to talk to I was there.
It seemed as if this participant took on the role of protector in the relationship, also in terms of
communication. He felt more comfortable listening and being the receiver when they
communicated. This participant felt that his own method of disclosure was mainly through
behaviour. For example, he constructed openness as a physical openness in the relationship, which
could entail inviting other love objects into the relationship. He further construed openness as being
honest about your needs and wants.
For one participant it was very important to disclose his feelings to his love object. According to
Monsour (1992), the sharing of personal thoughts and feelings would in itself be a description of
intimacy. The participant felt this was reciprocated by his love object. He believed that she could
share her feelings with him. They shared two-way communication, and talked about various topics.
The participant experienced this as being ‘close’ to his love object. There was a sense of openness



85
and closeness for him in the relationship with the girl, which was absent from the relationship he
had with his wife. These attributes (openness and closeness) might indicate that the relationship
proved to be more valued and whole than his marital relationship.
P: She could talk about anything with me. If something is not right, she talked to me ... I could also talk freely
with her ... The answers she gave me, was like a little adult. They truely understand what you say. They say just
what I need to hear, really. She understood the emotions, the feelings, the situation ...
P: Sy kan enigiets saam met my praat. As sy iets makeer as iets nie reg is nie, dan sou sy praat saam met my. Ek
kon ook lekker vrylik saam met haar gepraat het ... Die antwoorde wat sy vir my [gee] was amper soos die klein
mensies hulle verstaan regtig wat ’n mens sê. Want praat hulle iets wat ek nodig het om te hoor sê hulle
regtigwaar ... Dan lyk dit of sy verstaan die emosie sy verstaan die gevoel die situasie ...
This participant did not perceive the age difference as having a big impact on his relationship with
his love object. He also reported feeling heard and understood by his love object. It is clear from
this that he valued understanding and communication in a relationship more than age per se. He
also felt less pressure to know so much when he was with her. This allowed him to feel confident
and be more open towards her. The fact that this participant felt he could talk freely with the child
seems to indicate a process of opening and sharing of the self, which he may not have been able to
do in other relationships. He further stated that he felt comfortable and relaxed within their
relationship, more than with other people, including his wife. He also felt he could speak without
censure. The fact that he found communication with an 8-year old more satisfying than with adults
could indicate low intellectual and emotional levels of functioning and/or a high level of anxiety in
the presence of adults.
7.7. Control and power
In a paedo-relationship there is an inherent imbalance in the power relation. It seems obvious that
the adult should have a sense of control or power over the child. However, the participants did not
experience this power imbalance as explicitly as might be expected. In close relationships, both the
persons in the power advantaged and disadvantaged roles are able to manipulate the other (Mills &
Clark, 1982). Although all three the participants experienced a sense of control in their paedo
relationships, it seemed as if control was a secondary need. Participants needed to fulfil another
primary need, which was different for the individual participants. These needs included being a
caregiver, experiencing safety and increasing confidence.



86
For one participant the sense of control provided him with an opportunity to play the role of a father
figure or caregiver.
P: In a way I would say it’s like controlling his life and my life at the same time. Also, on the other side to it
when I see him he needed like a bigger person – a man – because his father is not there all the time so he
needed a bigger man to show him the right path.
P: He [John] was like a son to me – because I’m HIV I could never have children.
The paedo-relationship functioned as a romantic relationship, but also as an opportunity for this
participant to be a father figure. This relates to the idea that power may be a component of love
(Wilson, 1995). Power as a component of love refers to the desire to have power over the love
object and reciprocally know that you are under his or her power. In a child-parent relationship, the
parent may feel the desire for possession, while the child knows he or she is under the parent’s
power (Wilson, 1995). As such, the power component in the child-parent relationship would be
more static and one-way, whereas in a romantic adult-adult relationship the desire for power and
possession would be more dynamic and reciprocal. The participant expressed a need for romantic
relationships with older men at different times in his life, when he needed to feel taken care of. It
seems as if the roles of father and lover merged, as did the roles of child and lover. He also seemed
to experience conflict between wanting to be a parent and wanting to be a boy. There is a lack of
integration in his concept of child and adult, as he needs two different types of close relationships to
fulfil the needs of his psyche.
The power imbalance caused the one participant to feel more confident within his relationship. It
gave him the permission to speak freely and ‘be himself’. It seemed that having power in the
relationship did not give him a sense of control over his love object, but rather gave him power to
be himself by allowing him to feel confident and safe.
P: You are in control. You are happy, you can talk, you can talk freely. You don’t have to be rude.
P: Jy is in beheer. Jy is gelukkig, jy kan praat, jy kan vry praat soos jy wil. Jy hoef nie onbeskof te wees nie.
This participant also stated that he experienced his love object to be in control of the relationship at
times:



87
P: I think she had the power. She would tell the other two children who were also in the room to go out. Then I
had to go and lie on the bed, and she would come and lie on top of me. Then she would tell me that she wants my
baby.
P: Ek dink sy het die opperhand gehad. Sy sou miskien sê dat die wat nou die ander twee kindertjies wat nou ook
daar in die kamer is dat hulle moes uitgaan. Ek moes nou gaan lê op die bed en sy sal nou bo-op my kom lê, en
sy sal nou [sê dat sy] ’n babatjie wil hê.
Although the love object may not have fully comprehended what she was doing, the participant
experienced her behaviour as dominating and intentional. As such, he experienced an authentic
partner, expressing her own needs and desires.
The power relation in the paedo-relationships seemed to play a role in the participants’ need to
confirm their masculinity. According to Cossins (2000), the socially constructed masculine ideal
entails the image of the tough, dominant, heterosexual hero. Two of the participants reported
experiencing intense feelings of manliness when with their love objects:
P: She made me feel like a man. All the things we did, she was still clean man, she was clean.
P: Sy het my laat voel soos ’n man ... al die dingetjies wat ek sovêr gedoen het saam met haar. Sy is nog skoon
man, sy’s skoon.
This participant reported feeling manly because of the fact that the child was still clean and pure.
The purity of the love object in comparison to the participant may enhance the sense of manliness
the participant experiences, as he now appears to be tougher and rougher (more manly) than he
would appear in comparison to a love object that is less innocent and pure. As such, the feeling of
manliness becomes more intense as the love object is further removed from the construct of
masculinity. This is congruent with Connell’s (quoted in Cossins, 2000) explanation of masculinity,
namely that masculinity is defined by the distance in relation to what is rejected by masculinity.
Innocence, weakness, purity and lack of power are all concepts that are rejected in the social
construct of masculinity.
P: Gee, I don’t know, she made me feel like a man. Or like a woman should make a man feel, yesterday, I don’t
know. She made me feel like a man who feels like a man should feel.



88
P: Sjoe, ek weet nie, sy het my laat voel soos soos ’n man. Of soos ’n vrou ’n man moet laat voel, yesterday, ek
weet rêrig nie. Sy het my laat voel soos ’n man wat voel soos ’n man moet voel.
This participant explains his feeling of manliness as ‘how a woman should make a man feel’. It
seems as if there is a patriarchal perspective of gender and specifically masculinity embedded in his
construct of manliness (Cossins, 2000). For example, it is the responsibility of the woman to be in
service of the man and, as such, should ‘make him feel like a man’.
Both these participants seemed to draw from dominant cultural discourses of masculinity in
constructing their own ideas about masculinity. Thus, taking generalised power imbalances to the
extreme, the child becomes the disempowered woman. As such, the power imbalance in the
relationship based on the love object being an ‘innocent’ and ‘pure’ child provided the participants
with a greater sense of manhood.
Finally, as stated earlier in this chapter, all three participants connected with the role of a father or
caregiver in their paedo-relationships. This may form part of their constructs of manhood.
Attributes they associated with being a man in a relationship included being a protector and a
provider for the love object. These constructs relate closely to normative social constructs of
masculinity (Cossins, 2000), which in turn supports the idea that the paedo-relationships, in fact,
increased the participants’ sense of masculinity.
7.8. Conclusion
This chapter discussed the experience of the participants within the framework of close
relationships. Significantly, the three participants experienced their paedo-relationships as close
relationships. Moreover, their constructs of aspects found in close relationships coincided
significantly with universal constructs of these types of relationships. So far, the alternative
approach explored in this study seems to bear relevance to the study of paedophilia. The following
section will consider a comparison between additional emerging themes and, respectively, theories
of normative close relationship constructs and existing theories of paedophilia.



89
8. DISCUSSION
8.1. Introduction
The discussion will be presented from three different perspectives organised into three sections. The
first section will view the additional relationship themes, or metaphors, emerging from the study.
To differentiate from the close relationship themes discussed previously (such as sexuality, love,
self-disclosure and power), this section will refer to relationship metaphors, and will compare these
to normative relationship phenomena. The second part of the discussion will focus, from a
psychological viewpoint, on how the participants experienced and coped with psychological tension
and emotional conflict in maintaining paedo-relationships in their lives. The third and final section
will compare the findings of this study to existing models of thought and theories regarding
paedophilia.
From the data it has emerged that the participants’ central psychological needs that informed their
attraction to children included the need for experiencing trust, a feeling of safety, confirming their
gender identity, and receiving love and acceptance. All three participants experienced their paedo
relationships as close relationships. Their constructs of these relationships contained elements such
as courtship, love, self-disclosure, sexual desire, pleasure and power – aspects that are often seen as
universal in a close relationship. Moreover, the participants’ constructs of these relationship
elements coincided significantly with universal constructs thereof.
During this discussion it is important to keep in mind that I have made two crucial assumptions.
Firstly, universal psychological needs are the driving force that steer all humans towards close
relationships (Harvey & Weber, 2002), and secondly, there are an infinite variety of ways in which
individuals manifest these needs in behaviour. In this light, a paedophile’s need for close
relationships falls within what may be termed normative parameters, while the manner in which he
chooses to fulfil this need becomes ‘deviant’ by virtue of choosing a child as love object. The
emphasis will therefore be placed on the psychological needs of the participants that were fulfilled
through their behaviour.
The themes presented below are intertwined and together form the tapestry of the paedo
relationship. As such, it is almost impossible to discuss one theme without also referring to others.
Presenting these as separate themes results in a measure of artificiality, and a picture that may



90
conceivably shift depending on the lens through which it is viewed. Also, the format of the three
different sections attempts to provide some order to the discussion of the different themes. However,
the themes are not bound to any one particular section and could readily be moved around to
provide different perspectives on each theme.
8.2. Relationship metaphors
The ‘metaphors’ in this section are secrecy and the childlike game. These operate (and will be
discussed) on two levels: a behavioural level as well as a metaphorical level within the relationship.
Both secrecy and game playing have been highlighted as important components of close
relationships. In Witkin’s (quoted in Harvey & Weber, 2002) analysis of the eight major life cycles
in a close relationship, she drew attention to secrecy and ‘playing together’ as important concepts to
increase closeness and intimacy. The sharing of secrets (a major theme in phase 2) enhances
closeness and draws the couple together. Phase 6 is referred to as “the second childhood”, where the
couple rediscovers the emotional intimacy that playing can bring. As such, the script of the game
and the metaphor of secrecy also hold value in normative close relationships for enhancing
closeness and intimacy.
8.2.1. Secrecy
Secrecy plays a central role in the paedo-relationship. If the secret is disclosed, the relationship will
end. Moreover, it would imply betrayal by the love object and serious social and legal implications
for the paedophile.
The participants seemed to experience the ‘keeping of the secret’ as a symbol of mutual consent in
the relationship. Their love objects agreed to keep their relationships secret, which reinforced the
participants’ belief that the agreement was mutual. The secret could be viewed as a contract or bond
in the relationship: I ask you to keep the secret, and you choose whether or not you will. There is an
implicit contract embedded in the action of keeping the secret. This could be compared to the
explicit (and normative) contract of a love relationship: I ask you to be faithful to me, and you
choose whether or not you will, often needing to choose again and again. The partner chooses in the
same way, whether or not he or she will keep the relationship alive or dismantle it. In the paedo
relationship, the disclosure of the secret would result in a breakdown of trust, as well as ultimately
the relationship itself. The secret becomes a symbol of the bond, the agreement that keeps the
relationship together, a well as of the faithfulness, trustworthiness and commitment of the partner.



91
The secret becomes an overt barometer of trust. The paedophile does not have to ‘believe’ in the
trustworthiness of his love object. The secret can therefore be seen as a structure that manages the
trustworthiness of the love object. The three participants all struggled with the concept of trust.
They valued trust as an essential element of a close relationship, but were unable to trust their love
objects. As such, they relied on a structure to maintain and ‘enforce’ trustworthiness of the love
object.
The secret contributed to the excitement and sexual arousal of the participants. It seems that having
to meet in secret and ‘under cover’ led to sexual hyper-arousal for the participants. It created a sense
of danger and thus intensified excitement. Although one participant voiced his disappointment in
having to “hide his love from the world”, the act of meeting in secret, or being ‘under cover’,
seemed to add to the sexual excitement inherent in the contact. This supports Dixon’s (2002)
perspective regarding sexual discourse, namely that it often contains an element of forbidden
pleasures.
In relationship discourse, the secret could also metaphorically be related to an affair. One
participant referred to his paedo-relationships as ‘affairs’. Here the secret is extended into a secret
world for the two lovers. Both persons involved agree to keep the relationship a secret and thus
create a secret world where they can be together, and simultaneously be isolated from the social
environment. The lovers are freed from judgements and condemnations the world may have on their
actions. There is safety, as their world does not overlap with the rest of the lovers’ lives. Its closed
boundaries prevent contamination by other responsibilities and pressures. The covert nature of the
affair is of course in contradiction with the overt portrayal of the normative love relationship that is
open for the world to see. There is also a process of othering in the affair: them against the rest of
the world. This creates an illusion of power and grandiosity, as it may feel liberating to be in
opposition to ‘the rest of the world’. As such, this secret world establishes a sense of togetherness,
safety and intimacy.
In summary, there seems to be many similarities between the dynamics of the paedo-relationship
and the affair as it has been constructed in relationship discourse. They both share elements such as
the isolation, excitement and ‘us-and-them’ thinking, and also function to create safety and intimacy
for the members of the relationship.



92
In a normative sense, an affair can only continue when there is another original or primary close
relationship present. All the participants had at certain periods of their lives been involved in other
primary adult-adult relationships. Two participants were married and one participant had been
involved in homosexual adult relationships. However, these adult-adult relationships were not seen
by the participants as the primary or more satisfactory relationship. They were, in fact, seen as
smoke screens that enabled them to enjoy close relationships with children.
It is significant that all the participants viewed their paedo-relationship as more fulfilling than their
marital or adult-adult relationships. Traditionally, the normative marital relationship would provide
safety, stability and intimacy, while the affair would offer excitement and danger. In the paedo
relationship, however, it seems as if all these attributes are already present. The paedophile has the
best of both worlds. However, there are many other factors that conflict with and ultimately
diminish this seemingly positive dimension to the relationship. These factors will be discussed in
section 8.4 below as psychological tension.
8.2.2. Relationship scripts: the game
The notion of a game was present on a behavioural level (sexual activity) as well as a metaphorical
level within the paedo-relationships.
Two of the participants used the script of a game in their sexual activity with children. They played
‘mommy and daddy’ with their love objects. This relates to childhood sexual games these two
participants played with their peers as children. The participants were respectively 4 and 8 years old
when they had their first sexual experiences, in the form of sexual play, with other children. An
example from the data follows:
P: Then I tell them: “You all are the children, you are the mommy, and I’m the daddy.” Then I quickly build a
house from cardboard, underneath the table – and there we have a house. Then I gather a few pieces of glass and
call the kids: “Hey kids, here’s some money. Go and do the shopping and don’t hurry back, because, mommy
and daddy wants to sleep.” So I had sex with women from a very young age.
P: No, she was game. Later we made it a permanent thing.
P: Dan sê ek straight, “Julle almal is die kinders, jy is die ma, ek is die pa.” Nou maak ek gou vir ons ’n huisie
van sommer’n klomp cardboard net so daar onder die tafeltjie. Sit nou die cardboard daarom die tafeltjie, right
daai is ons twee se huis. Tel ek miskien ’n klomp glase op: “hei kinders hier is geld julle moet nou gaan shopping
en julle kom nie gou terug nie because daddy en mommy wil nou gaan slaap.” So het ek maar nou vroegtydig af
het ek al seksuele omgang gehad saam met vroumense.
P: Nai, sy was game ons het later sommer, mmm, dit ’n permanente besigheid [gemaak].



93
From a young age this participant identified with the role of being a father, and having a wife to
have sex with. Later, in adult life, he used the same script and role play to create time alone with his
young love object. He would give his own children money to go to the shops and buy sweets. The
only differences were that he now gave his (real) children (real) money, and he was a (real) father.
Embedded in this script is the narrative of marriage and family, the influence of which will be
discussed in a following section. However, in using this script in a gamelike fashion, the paedophile
regresses to childhood. This concept also fits with the concept of secrecy. The child enjoys and
takes pleasure from having a secret. He is ‘naughty’ or engaging in forbidden activities that excite
him.
The gamelike (and childlike) script may have proved the most useful for the participants to follow
in the context of paedo-relationships. The normative courtship and couples scripts mainly involve
romantic heterosexual gestures and gender-driven communication and intimacy styles (Harvey &
Weber, 2002), none of which would be appropriate for the paedo-relationship, as it consists of an
adult and a child. The child is (usually) not yet familiar with scripts of romantic relationships and
gender identity affirmation. The paedophile and the child connect with each other in the more
childlike script of a game; something they are both familiar with.
This gamelike behaviour was especially clear during courtship where the participant had a hidden
agenda (secret) as he tried to find a love object. The courtship behaviour became gamelike:
involving the role play of being a scout (for example, the participant who watched the children play
each day), a protector and a comforter. Also in normative relationships gamelike behaviour may be
more explicit in the courtship phase. Gamelike scripts are effective when relating to each other,
limiting the risk of conflict and/or overt rejection.
Finally, perceiving sexual activity as a ‘game’ could reduce anxiety for the participants. In a game it
is not real, and no ‘real’ harm can be done. Moreover, the script acts as a guide to and framework
for sexual activity. In a world with many uncertainties and anxieties around sexual expression, it
could be comforting to have a script to follow.



94
8.3. Cognitive disorganisation
All the participants exhibited what might be termed cognitive disorganisation in their thought
processes. This manifested in jumping from one memory to the next, a sense of confusion,
cognitive flightiness and contradictory statements. Possible explanations for this may include
uncompleted educational development, limited insight, the lack of a cognitive framework and the
process of splitting. Although psychological tension also contributed to and formed part of (because
of the myriad of interrelated components) the cognitive disorganisation, it warrants being presented
separately in the following section.
8.3.1. Educational, intellectual and emotional development
For all three participants, an unstable upbringing caused them to experience irregular and
incomplete primary education. Only one participant received secondary education. Consequently,
the skills necessary for articulation and coherent verbal communication may have been lacking.
Participants demonstrated limitations in self-awareness and insight. This may indicate a low
Emotional Quotient. It may especially prove challenging to express feelings and experiences of an
intimate nature, as present in close relationships, with low emotional intelligence. These factors
may have contributed to the simple but flighty manner in which answers were delivered. Moreover,
it seemed as if the sense of disorganisation was rooted in the absence of consistent cognitive
frameworks for organising their experience, as their narratives contained many contradictions.
8.3.2. Absence of cognitive framework
The participants had no access to a narrative that they could connect with. Instead, they had to
position themselves in relation to the scripts appropriate to the incarcerated child molester, the
psychopathological paedophile, and normative (or traditional) marriage/relationship and family
narratives.
Society creates and provides us with discourses that help us articulate and understand our lives.
According to Brooks and Edwards (1997), we narrate our lives to make sense of our relationship
with the world. In doing so we select aspects to include in our story and omit others. The aspects we
select are placed in relation to other aspects of experiences or knowledge. This forms order, pattern
or sense in our past, present and future. Much of what we include and exclude is construed from
dominant discourses in the culture. Foucault (1980) explained this selection process as a filtering of
our experiences through a known discourse before we communicate them to the world and,



95
consequently, assign meaning to the phenomenon. The unstoried knowledges we hold might be
seen as subjugated by society and the dominant discourse (Foucault, 1980).
Much of what the participants shared during the interviews could be referred to as unstoried
knowledges. Although the discourse of close relationships presented the participants with a tool to
tell their stories, they were still constricted (and confused) by the absence of a narrative to relate
their story to. They all reverted to the inappropriate narratives of marriage and family in an attempt
to express their experiences, as will be discussed below. They had no opportunity to acknowledge
and integrate their needs and feelings, and may have experienced a process of splitting. Splitting is
a sense of disconnection when irreconcilable needs or expectations are simultaneously adhered to
(McLean, 1996). The result is a persona that engages with children on the one hand, and another
persona that engages with society in an adult manner on the other. The splitting could also have
manifested in, and contributed to, the disorganised thoughts and contradictory explanations.
8.3.3. Marriage and family narratives
The narrative of marriage and family has shaped society’s thought on sexuality and has limited the
acceptable options available (Brooks & Edwards, 1997; Parry & Doan, 1994). In exploring the
close relationship elements inherent in paedophilic dynamics, it became apparent that the marriage
and family narrative also dominates the paedophile’s construct (for lack of access to a more
appropriate narrative) of his sexual and relationship identity. A few examples extracted from the
data illustrate this point:
P: That’s why I said – if she only could have been my wife at that age.
P: Dit is hoekom ek gesê het – as dit nou my vrou gewees het op daai ouderdom.
This participant expressed his longing for a young and innocent partner. He seemed unable to step
outside the dominant discourse of marriage and family, while engaging in a close relationship.
P: Love for me is to care for a woman. I must do my manly duties for her.
P: Vir my is liefde, ek moet omgee vir ’n vrou. Ek moet my manlike pligte moet kan doen vir haar.
As an adult, his construct of love is based on the discourse of marriage. His conception of love
changed, however, when he was asked about ‘ideal love’.
P: My perfect love is my children [...] The love I have for them and they for me.



96
P: My perfekte liefde is my kinders [...]Die liefde wat ek vir hulle het en hulle vir my het, mevrou.
This participant related ‘ideal love’ to the love he had for his biological children. Although this
statement was still embedded in family discourse, it is interesting that the concept of ‘ideal love’
moved him to think of his children. He might have chosen his children above his wife, as they
represented the closest thing to his actual love object.
P: Because I always told her: “Watch, you have to grow, because I want to make you my wife.”
P: Want ek het haar altyd gesê: “Jy watch jy moet groei, jy moet groei want because ek wil jou my vrou maak.”
This participant’s preference for young girls is contradictory to his wish for his love object to grow
up, yet the construct of husband and wife is the only one available to him in expressing his
commitment to her.
As an overtly gay man, the third participant was not trapped in the narrative of marriage between a
man and his wife. He did, however, relate to elements of family discourse, and used the concept of
parenting in his explanation of his relationship with John, his love object.
P: He [John] was like a son to me – because I’m HIV I could never have children.
8.4. Psychological tension
As stated above, the participants’ narratives contained many contradictions. Many of these
‘irregularities’ seemed to be the result of tension between ego-syntonic sexual desires and ego
dystonic perceptions of wrongdoing. From a psychodynamic perspective, it could be said that there
was a struggle between the participants’ internal psychological needs and their super-ego (which
represented societal standards and norms). This tension manifested in three main themes, namely
confusion, the creation of rules or criteria, and formulation of reasons.
8.4.1. Confusion
The constructs held by the three participants regarding their paedo-relationships were challenged by
conviction and incarceration. They managed to keep their constructs of paedo-relationships intact
outside prison, even despite their awareness of the social condemnation of paedophilia, but they
were directly confronted with condemning constructs once inside prison. For example, the
participants were found guilty of sexual assault and exposed to a sexual offenders group as



97
‘treatment’. This may have left them with a sense of confusion regarding their paedo-relationships
as well as sexuality. In their attempt to make sense of and integrate these new constructs, certain
irregularities were observed. Some of these ‘contradictions’ follow:
One participant stated he loved Lisa, his love object, and still loved her. He then questioned this
love, as he feared that he might have done her harm. He also questioned his respect for children. He
argued that he could not have done the things he did if he had respect for them. A few minutes later,
however, he explained that he did respect Lisa in his own way and that perhaps it was only his
behaviour that was not respectful.
P: Because, there is respect in a way from my side, but if we talk about the offence, no there is no respect in that.
P: Want daar is miskien respek, op ’n way, by my kant af, but ons praat nou van die misdaad – daar is nie respek
daarin nie.
In further discussions, this participant stated that he did not believe that sexual activity with
children could lead to any emotional harm. His concern, instead, had always been about potential
physical harm. Therefore, it seems unlikely that he would regard his own behaviour as disrespectful.
This participant jumped from one perspective to the next, unsuccessfully trying to integrate his own
feelings for Lisa with the social judgement experienced.
All the participants had impossible future dreams. Two of the participants wanted to marry their
love objects when they were old enough. They used to share their dreams of marriage and children
with their love objects. Both these participants admitted to having a sexual preference for young
girls. When young girls inevitably become adult women, they cease to meet this criterion.
Their dreams of being married and having children may highlight their desire for being accepted by
the rest of the world, as a socially appropriate couple. Although this is another example of the
confusion marriage and family discourse created for these participants, it could also be an example
(in normative relationship discourse) of their sexual desire maturing into love, thereby transcending
paedosexuality. Similarly, adults have preferences of attraction, such as appearance, age,
personality traits and the value system of their potential partner. However, as soon as the potential
partner becomes loved, the expectations and preferences are less important, the love is directed to
the person himself or herself.



98
Confusion was also found in the participants’ perception of the love object’s ideal age. One
participant stated that the ideal age would be 35 years of age. Then he changed the age to 27. The
age dropped again, and the participant added another criteria: that she should have had sex with
other men before him. As such, he would not be held accountable for anything menacing. His fear
of doing something ‘wrong’ became more extreme, to the point where he stated that it might be
wrong to have sex with a 20 year old if she is a virgin. He seemed confused about what is right and
wrong. This confusion seems to be predominantly rooted in the conflict between his desires and
offender/perpetrator discourse.
More disorganised and self-contradicting thought was found in the participants’ sense of sexual
identity. One participant stated that it was a “shame” that he had to hide his love for the boy and girl
with whom he had had relationships. However, this participant also stated that he had lost all hope
in paedo-relationships, as they had landed him in prison too many times. At the time of being
interviewed, this participant presented talks about ‘child molesting’ at schools, warning children
about ‘child molesters’ (the unit of social services in the prison supported him in this endeavour).
This behaviour in itself highlighted the loss of hope in paedo-relationships and the realisation that
the children might not have valued the relationship as much as he did. He now believed he might
have manipulated them in some way. This new belief, which he might have developed during his
time in prison, caused this participant to experience guilt. His involvement in warning children
about ‘child molesters’ might have resulted from the guilt he experienced and could be an attempt
to still his true desires and act ‘responsibly’.
Another participant claimed that his preferred age for a love object would be 12 to 13 years of age.
Only later in the interview he admitted to a sexual preference for 6- to 8-year olds. He then added
that he should, therefore, not be let out of prison, as he might still be a “danger” to society. Again,
his reaction was incongruent with his experience of love for Anne (his love object). This participant
had stated earlier in the interview that love meant to act in the best interests of the love object.
Therefore he might not authentically believe that he could be a danger to Anne or to society,
although he might have learned this through his conviction and participation in sexual offender
groups.
8.4.2. Rule creation
In an apparent attempt to deal with confusion and irregularity (in the absence of other guidelines for
propriety) the participants created criteria to provide structure and stability. These criteria seem to



99
function as a barometer to judge and justify their sexual behaviour with children. It appears that
these rules were individually derived from social constructs by each of the participants.
One participant claimed he “used to” prefer boys around the ages of 9 to 14. Because this lead to
incarceration, he changed his sexual preference to a “legal age” of between 15 and 17. Firstly, it
seems unlikely that a person would change sexual preference out of sheer will. Secondly, it would
still be illegal to have a 15-year old sexual partner. This statement highlighted the frustration he was
experiencing, as well as the lack of knowledge and understanding of what social or legal constructs
demanded of him.
Another participant did not perceive his sexual behaviour as ‘wrong’. However, he learned that by
social and legal standards it was incorrect. This posed a problem: if he did not understand these
standards he might cross the social line between right and wrong without knowing it. To prevent
this from happening, he created his own set of criteria. These included the following: the girls must
have had sex with other men before him, they must have breasts, and he is not allowed to have sex
with the girl – only fondling and masturbation is allowed. These criteria, again, highlight the
confusion and frustration caused by the tension between his own experience of close relationships
and the enforcement of a particular social construct on him.
This participant claimed he was relieved to be caught. He was concerned about what might have
happened if the relationship had continued. Having intercourse with his love object would have
made him a child rapist. He experienced the notion of being labeled a child rapist as horrific.
Conflict arose between the desire to express love and an awareness of becoming known as a child
rapist. This caused anxiety and confusion.
8.4.3. Reasons
Two of the three participants believed they had a reason for being attracted to children. From a
cognitive-behavioural perspective, these convictions could be termed rationalisations. However, to
avoid inviting other assumptions (that may accompany this approach) into the discussion, it will not
be used here. The data suggests that having a reason, however tenuous, decreases psychological
dissonance and may help the participant to understand his own behaviour.
One participant believed that being raped as a child by an adult man, and continuing a relationship
with that man, played a significant role in his own sexual development and orientation. He implied



100
that he had suffered from emotional problems as a result of the rape and relationship. It seemed as if
the knowledge of these factors assisted him in justifying his sexual orientation. Although this
participant’s reasons coincide with the abuser-abused notion in the precondition model of
paedophilia (Araji & Finkelhor, 1986), it also fits with the cognitive distortion theory, which states
that the paedophile tends to use any means to validate his behaviour (Howitt, 1995) (as discussed in
section 3.4.1.1.).
Another participant claimed he was rejected by his girlfriend as a teenager, and as a result became
very angry at women. He thought he could get back at her by hurting other women’s children. It
seems unusual that this participant chose this way of seeking revenge, unless there was some
history of sexual attraction to children. He also admitted that his ‘revenge’ had transformed into
sexual preference, which could be explained by the sexual learning theory of paedophilia (Howells,
1981). Because this participant exhibited sexual interest in children, before his girlfriend left him, it
seems more likely that he chose this ‘method of revenge’ to match his true sexual preferences. He
furthermore said that he had never “hurt a girl”, which was incongruent with his stated aim of
revenge. Using this particular reason, or explanation, seemed to make it easier for him to openly
discuss his sexual relations with children.
One participant, however, did not offer a specific reason in defence of his sexual orientation.
Although he mentioned his anger and hatred towards adult women, he did not use this as a reason
for his sexual preference. He seemed confident with high self-esteem, and it may therefore not have
been necessary to defend his sexual preference to me, or to the world.
8.5. Theoretical considerations
This part of the discussion compares existing theories of paedophilia to research findings of this
study. Several theories will be referred to, including theories of power relations, sexual learning, the
precondition model, cognitive distortion theory, as well as Jungian approaches. I assume that all of
the theories regarding paedophilia may hold some validity. It is my opinion that it would be
counterproductive to search for a universal theory to explain paedophilia, as paedophiles comprise a
heterogenous population. I suggest, therefore, that in the current state of research regarding
paedophilia it would be more useful to utilise theories as different lenses through which to view this
phenomenon, in an attempt to enhance understanding, rather than as tools for explanation.



101
8.5.1. Theories of power relations
Many theorists contend that there is a power imbalance inherent in paedophilic relationships.
Theories on power relations, such as feminist theory, postulate that paedophilia is an extension of a
male dominated society which is expressed in sexual abuse of women and children (Cossins, 2000).
However, the participants in this study oscillated between power and subservience, much as one
would expect in a normal relationship. Furthermore, in agreement with findings from a study by
Ivey and Simpson (1998), the participants experienced a secondary sense of safety and masculinity.
This suggests that power in the relationship was not a value in itself, but rather a way to meet
psychological needs (such as sense of safety and affirming gender identity).
The paedophile finds himself in a position of power due to his age, physical size, strength, and
usually, intellectual capacity. This creates a safe space in which the paedophile feels permitted to be
himself. This coincides with similar findings by Ivey and Simpson (1998), in which it is stated that
the adult status of the paedophile (in the eyes of the child) provides him with a temporary sense of
strength and importance. For the participants, it also became easier to express their thoughts and
feelings and to communicate openly within the relationship. It would seem that the overt power
imbalance is a precondition for self-disclosure.
The power imbalance seems unstable and dynamic. There is an interaction between the overt power
of the paedophile and the covert power that the child has over him (although the child may be
unaware of this). This interplay was especially visible in relationship themes such as the secret,
sexual activity and naivety/innocence.
The secret is initiated and enforced (overt power) by the paedophile, as he tells the child that he
would be in trouble if the secret comes out. However, the child could disclose the secret at any
moment, even accidentally (covert power). During sexual activity the paedophile has the advantage
of experience (overt power), while the child is the object of the paedophile’s desire (covert power).
The paedophile has knowledge about the world, relationships and sexual activities (overt power),
while the child’s naivety and innocence is the essence of eroticism and desire (covert power) for the
paedophile.
Cossins (2000) asserted that, in today’s culture, men experience a dynamic fusion of power and
powerlessness. In an attempt to maintain the continuation of patriarchal power, the construct of a
hyper-masculine ideal of toughness and dominance emerged, stereotypically portrayed as a



102
‘heterosexual hero’ (Cossins, 2000, p.115). This masculine ideal, however, is in contrast to the
realistic physique/appearance of most men (Connell, 1987). As such, this has created a power
relation between men that might manifest in a sense of alliance, dominance or subordinance.
According to Connell (1987), cultural discourses and social practices maintain and reinforce these
power relations between types of masculinity and as such between men. An example would be the
culturally created masculine dominance of heterosexual men over homosexual men (Connell, 1987).
I suggest even more so is the masculine dominance of heterosexual (and homosexual) men over
paedophiles.
The way in which sexuality is expressed could therefore enhance, or diminish, the sense of
masculinity (Kimmel & Messner, quoted in Cossins, 2000). Men who experience a sense of
powerlessness may seek opportunity to have power over less powerful individuals, such as children.
Connell (1987) suggested that paedophilia is such a masculinising practice.
The above theory is supported by the participants’ experiences of their paedo-relationships. As
previously stated, the three participants experienced intense feelings of masculinity in their
relationships with children. Two of the participants associated masculinity with the heterosexual
male archetype, while the third participant constructed masculinity as the protective father figure.
As such, the nature of the adult-child sexual relationship may allow men to reproduce elements of
masculine sexuality congruent with the masculine ideal: a masculine cultural environment that is
based on relations of power.
The experience of manliness may also be intensified because of the innocence of the love object.
The words used by the participants such as “clean”, “untouched” and “pure virgin” give an almost
romantic impression and may cause them to feel even more masculine as a result.
Finally, the adult-child relationship seems to reinforce the power-powerlessness dynamic.
Relationships with children provide individual moments of strength and power, but to be sexually
attracted to children per se distance paedophiles from the heterosexual masculine stereotype, and
thus, universally, have the opposite effect.
Another theory of power may bear relevance to the data. According to Stets (1993), people have a
tendency to control their partner when they experience a lack of control over their environment. The



103
participants experienced physical and/or emotional abuse, as well as trauma and instability during
their childhood, and may have experienced a lack of control in their personal lives. The focus
changes from how the paedophile exerts his power to specific attempts to counter a sense of
powerlessness. It was suggested by Howells (1981) that the paedophile may seek the paedo
relationship in an attempt to overcome his childhood sense of powerlessness. I suggest it is also the
sense of powerlessness in adulthood that motivates his behaviour.
Another theme of powerlessness has been suggested by Marshall (quoted in Cossins, 2000).
Paedophiles experience a lack of intimacy and the ability to be intimate. Physical intimacy, such as
sexual activity and sexual disclosure, often has to fulfil this need and help him to overcome his
sense of powerlessness. However, no evidence was found to support the notion that the participants
lacked an ability to be intimate. Although the participants struggled with some aspects of emotional
intimacy, they referred to constructs of intimacy in their paedo-relationships. They felt heard and
understood by their love objects, and experienced a sense of closeness. This could mean that they
were all able to create intimacy, other than purely physical intimacy, in their paedo-relationships.
Intimacy may also have resulted from the intimate nature of sexual self-disclosure in the paedo
relationship. The paedophile discloses his sexuality only to the child, and has to keep it secret from
the rest of the world. In return, the paedophile may feel accepted and loved by the child’s emotional
responsiveness and acceptance of him. This relates to Ivey and Simpson’s (1998) findings, where it
is suggested that the child’s warm responsiveness is in contrast with the rejection the paedophile
might otherwise experience. The choice to be with children fulfils the need for acceptance and
validation.
8.5.2. Developmental and precondition theories
Two of the participants mentioned an aversion to and dislike of adult women. One participant in
particular displayed immense anger towards women. He said that he “hated” women and expressed
a desire to kill all the women who have ever cheated on their loved ones. Another participant had
his first “real” sexual experience as a teenager with his girlfriend (the sexual games he played, as a
4-year old, was not regarded as sex). It was an unpleasant experience for him, as he believed this
girlfriend tricked him into having sex with her. He then asked her to marry him, but was rejected.
Since then he has not been able to trust women. These two participants’ experiences support
Greenberg’s (1990) suggestion that traumatic sexual encounters or relationships early in life may
cause the paedophile to relate adult sexual partners to anxiety, distress or, as in this case, anger.



104
The mentioned negative feelings toward women relate to the ‘blockages’ Araji and Finkelhor (1986)
identified in their precondition model of paedophilia. Blockages could include difficulty relating to
females as well as problematic romantic and sexual relations. Two participants experienced a fear
of trust in their paedo-relationships. On the one hand, they valued trust as one of the most important
elements of a relationship, but struggled to truly trust their love objects. Trust also seemed to be a
primary psychological need for both and drove them to engage in close relationships. In the case of
an adult-child relationship, the child would not be associated with anxiety (as it would be in the
case of an adult). The child could appear to be more accepting and emotionally responsive and the
paedophile might feel more confident, therefore presenting a context for him to engage in a close
relationship.
Finkelhor (1984) also made reference to the possible arrested psychological development of the
paedophile. He considered that the paedophile’s emotional incongruence might explain the non
sexual element in his motivation to engage with children. Finkelhor (1984), as well as other
researchers (Groth, 1979; Ivey & Simpson, 1998), further asserted that the paedophile experiences
himself as a child and has childish emotional needs. The data in this study suggests that the
paedophile enjoys being a child, and at times experience himself as a child.
8.5.3. Sexual learning theories
The three participants had their first sexual experience at a prepubescent age. They were,
respectively, 4, 7 and 8 years old. Two of the participants had their first sexual experiences with
girls younger than themselves, and may have internalised having a child for a sexual partner
through sexual learning (Howells, 1981). For both these participants the sexual experiences (as
young boys) were merely seen as games. The memory of sexual activities with young girls may still
have been present in adulthood. It is possible that the three participants may have internalised the
notion that it is acceptable, even positive, to engage in a sexual relationship at a very young age.
The participants’ own positive experiences of sexual activity at a young age might have been
incorporated into the social and interpersonal components of their sexual desire (Levine, 1995).
Ivey and Simpson (1998) referred to the intimate childhood sex play as a substitute emotional
intimacy, which is then repeated in adulthood. A young love object would therefore become
sexually desirable. Yet there must be other variables at play here since, as pointed out earlier, not all
boys who have intense childhood sexual experiences later become attracted to children.
The data furthermore suggests that sexual learning could also be habit. Through sexual learning, the
intense pleasure of the sexual experience with the innocent love object may have been perpetuated



105
by a compulsion to have more. This relates to Finkelhor’s (1984) reference to the highly reinforcing
nature of masturbation, and Ivey and Simpson’s (1998) suggestion of the addictive quality of this
behaviour.
A habit could also suggest a daily routine, and contribute to normalising the behaviour. The
participants seemed to experience this notion of habit in their close relationships. An agreement was
made between them and their love objects to see each other regularly. Even though the sense of
habit reduces the freedom of choice in the matter, it is also common in normative relationships
(where spending time together also becomes a habit within the relationship).
8.5.4. Cognitive distortions
As stated earlier, a marked tension between the participants’ own experiences of paedo
relationships and the social construct existed. Out of the three themes identified (confusion, rule
creation and reasons), the formulation of reasons is best explained by the cognitive distortion theory
of paedopihlia. From a cognitive behavioural approach, much of the data supports the theory that
cognitive distortions such as minimalisation, justification of behaviour, redefining abuse as
consensual, and blame shifting (Howitt, 1995), play a significant role in paedophilic behaviour.
However, from a phenomenological approach the notion of cognitive distortion seems to deprive
the participant of his own truth. It speaks to the behaviour, but not the psychological needs that are
present as well.
8.5.5. Psychodynamic theory
From a Jungian point of view, paedophilia is believed to stem from an idealised longing for the
purity and innocence of childhood (Howitt, 1995). This theory has proven to bear the most
relevance to the findings from the current study. Many examples of longing for the innocence of
childhood were found in the data. The three participants were attracted to the innocence they saw in
their love object; and they themselves had a desire to experience the same innocence within the
relationships. The participants regressed to childhood behaviour (innocent behaviour) in their
courtship, sexual activities, and in the management of the relationship.
Being with the love object did not only satisfy the intense sexual desire for innocence and naivety,
as seen above, it also satisfied the psychological needs for safety, trust, acceptance, closeness
(intimacy), love and confirming masculinety. Moreover, the participants might have experienced it
as the retrieval of a lost childhood, after experiencing physical and/or emotional abuse as children.
To augment this argument, I suggest that the participants might have experienced a sense of



106
redemption from being engaged with innocence: redeemed from being unacceptable for this world;
rescued from not being loved; and empowered to feel adequate.
8.6. Conclusion
The discussion presented findings from the data using three different perspectives: normative
relationship discourse, a psychological perspective and a theoretical consideration.
It was found that normative concepts of close relationships can be related to the paedo-relationship.
This could aid the paedophile in creating his own (holistic) narrative of his experiences, in order to
facilitate acknowledgement and integration for himself. The paedophile endures psychological
tension and conflict in the absence of known narratives to relate to (apart from the dominant
narratives mentioned above). The lack of opportunity to confirm his identity, and the dualistic
context within which the paedophile finds himself, reinforces the process of splitting. As
paedophiles comprise a heterogenous population (Howitt, 1995), it serves little purpose to search
for one central theory to explain paedophilia.
The choice and responsibility to search for the most effective approach and theory when dealing
with paedophilia therefore remains that of the researcher or therapist. Through the implicitly
condemning assumptions of positivist approaches, we have forgotten that the paedophile deserves
the same space and acceptance as any client in their quest to find help and support.



107
9. CONCLUSION
This study attempted to answer the call of researchers such as Gieles (2001), Kear-Colwell and
Boer (2000), Levett (2004), Moser (2001), Rind et al. (2002) and Schmidt (2002) for more research
to facilitate a better understanding of paedophilia. It aimed to do so by (a) identifying and analysing
some of the problems inherent in current research discourses that are informed largely by
underlying positivist assumptions and (b) by providing the psychological dimensions of close
relationships as an alternative conceptual framework for constructing paedophilic sexuality.
This study began by outlining and analysing current theories and approaches to paedophilia both in
terms of their paradigmatic underpinnings and their specific content. The analysis suggested that,
due to their implicit moral and deterministic nature, underlying positivist assumptions might
partially be to blame for the apparent impasse in generating theory on paedophilia.
In an attempt to address these issues, the alternative framework of the close relationship was
presented. In applying it to the qualitative data gathered from three convicted paedophiles, it
emerged that the forming of paedo-relationships is informed and motivated by expectations that
their psychological needs for close relationship could be met with a child. There was strong
evidence to suggest that paedophiles experience the same universal psychological needs for forming
close relationships as anyone else and that, from the paedophile’s perspective, these needs are more
likely to be met in a relationship with a child, than with an adult.
As pointed out, the participants’ experiences of paedo-relationships could be viewed as unstoried
knowledges as they evidently experienced an acute lack of legitimate social narrative by which they
could express their experience. This then manifests in the attempt to draw on fundamentally
incompatible social discourses and resulting confused and often cognitively convoluted personal
narratives such as marriage and family or criminality and pathology. It appears that the framework
of the close relationship might serve as a tool to assist in the narrating and understanding of these
stories.
This study did not attempt to provide etiological explanations or to answer why a paedophile prefers
a child in close relationships. The question “why?” evokes the need to search for an answer, cause,
or an excuse (Jenkins, 1990). Instead, the study is an attempt to ask how and what it is to be in a
close relationship with a child, thereby minimising the need for self-justificatory explanation on the



108
part of the participants while creating a space in which to explore the question of how a paedophile
experiences and creates meaning in his close relationships.
This fundamental position could also be extended to the area of psychotherapeutic intervention with
paedophiles. Acknowledging wrongdoing and taking full responsibility have been central to
therapeutic interventions for sexual offenders (Jenkins, 1990). However, taking responsibility in an
authentic manner is a slow and painful process (Van Greunen, Kotzé, & Kotzé, 2001). As
demonstrated in this study, the positivist underpinnings of most current therapeutic interventions for
paedophilia contain moral, social, legal and pathological assumptions. These assumptions reinforce
splitting (McLean, 1996), psychological conflict and tension, and the psyche-fragmentation noted
during treatment. As the paedophile has no other cognitive framework for processing his experience,
he cannot feel heard or understood, and his psychological needs remain unmet. This, consequently,
may decrease the chance of effective, lasting behavioural change.
The themes and interpretations offered in this study might contribute to supportive therapeutic
strategies. I would like to draw attention to the normative nature of the identified themes (such as
close relationships, courtship, sexual desire, closeness, love, self-disclosure, power, masculinity,
secrecy and relationship scripts). As such, these themes may enable the paedophile to relate to
normative ideas and concepts. This could aid his process of creating a personal narrative from his
experiences. Key to the issue of normative concepts would be the creation of a platform where the
paedophile can approach and acknowledge his psychological needs as well as his ego-systonic and
ego-dystonic behaviour. Once acceptance, acknowledgement and integration have occurred, the
freedom of choice and change becomes more possible. Constructive strategies may then be
developed and employed to create different scripts and mechanisms for meeting his psychological
needs.
In summary, the discourse of close relationship and themes provided in this study might contribute
to less dualistic and more supportive therapeutic approaches. This will enable the therapist to
explore with the paedophile how he experiences his paedo-relationships and to support him in
acknowledging possible psychological conflict before, during and after the relationship.
Consequently, the therapist and paedophile can work together to integrate the simultaneously
arousing and distressing needs and emotions he previously has had to manage with limited
cognitive and interpersonal resources. Ultimately, these approaches could contribute to the way in
which we communicate with and treat any perceived ‘deviant’ phenomenon in our society.



109
Future research could entail incorporating female participants and particpants who have not been
involved with the criminal justice system. A limitation of the current study was that all three
participants were convicted and incarcerated male child sexual offenders, and were thus
unrepresentative of the general population of paedophiles (Cossins, 2000; Howitt, 1995). As a
qualitative study, no attempt was made to generalise to a population. However, the participants had
all been subjected to therapeutic programmes such as the “sexual offenders group”, which could
have influenced their authentic perceptions and account of their experiences. In addition, a larger
sample could enhance the validity of themes from the data. The emergent need for additional data to
test the usefulness of close relationship as a framework allows me to conclude in supprt of Levett’s
(2004) request for more stories of paedophiles’ experiences, as they will give us access to “new
ideas ... and perhaps new and different links and inferences” (p. 430).
