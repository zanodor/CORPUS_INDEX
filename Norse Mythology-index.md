Because this book is intended for a general audience, a decision was made
to limit the use of the specialized characters usually employed to repre
sent the sounds of the older Germanic languages, including those of Nor
way and Iceland during the Viking Age and Middle Ages. Specifically, in names
and titles the letter π (thorn) is here represented as th, ƒ (eth) as d, and o ̧ (o-hook)
as ö. These letters have, however, been retained in discussions of specific terms,
such as “πylja” and “goƒi.” Other characters, such as æ, œ, and ö, have been
retained. In addition, the nominative singular final r has been removed from
names, and the accent marks have been removed from the names “Odin” and
“Thor,” since these forms are the most widely used in English.
These compromises naturally create inconsistencies, but I hope they will
not divert from the aim of the work, namely, to let the texts speak for them
selves and to give the reader an idea of the main issues in the study of Scandi
navian mythology.

A NOTE ON ORTHOGRAPHY

1
INTRODUCTION
W
hen most of us use the word “myth” in conversation, we refer to
something that is not true. When historians of religion use it, they
generally refer to a representation of the sacred in words. When
anthropologists use it, they often refer to narratives that tell about the formation
of some social institution or behavior. None of the definitions, however, will
hold directly for the characters and stories this book treats. That is in part
because of the enormous time frame: Materials relevant to the study of Scandi
navian mythology, broadly defined, span two millennia or more. But even if we
limit the discussion to the relatively small body of texts from the Viking Age
and later Middle Ages about the gods Odin, Thor, Frey, and the others and their
constant battles with forces of evil and chaos, it is difficult to reconcile these
texts with any one of the narrow definitions of myth suggested above. Certainly
they had some truth value to the people who composed them and those who
wrote them down, but these were not always the same people—usually they
were not—and it is obvious that what was true, sacred, and an account of how
the world got to be the way it is to a Viking Age pagan poet can have been none
of the above to a Christian scribe copying the story in a manuscript hundreds of
years after the Viking Age. It is therefore easier and more enlightening to talk of
formal criteria and content.
In form, then, myth in general, and the texts that comprise Scandinavian
mythology in particular, are narrative, although this narrative is couched in both
verse and prose. In general, one expects myth to recount important events that
took place at the beginning of time and helped shape the world, and Scandina
vian mythology indeed has sequences that tell of the origin of the cosmos and of
human beings. The story goes on, however, to the destruction and rebirth of the
cosmos, and everything in it is presented in light of an enduring struggle
between two groups of beings, the gods on the one hand and giants on the other
hand. These terms are to some extent misleading: Although the group that cre
ates and orders the cosmos is often referred to by words that can best be trans
lated “gods,” the principal word, “æsir,” is explicitly presented by the most
1



important medieval interpreter, Snorri Sturluson, as meaning “People of Asia,”
and indeed the word often has the feel in mythological texts of an extended kin
group or tribe rather than of a collective of deities. And the other group, the ones
who aim for the destruction of the cosmos and disruption of order, are certainly
not “giant” in the sense that they are demonstrably larger than the gods. They
are usually called the “jötnar,” and again as the term is used in the mythology it
feels more like a tribal or kin group than anything else.
The world in which the æsir and jötnar play out their struggle has its own
set of place-names but is essentially recognizable as Scandinavia. There are
rivers, mountains, forests, oceans, storms, cold weather, fierce winters, eagles,
ravens, salmon, and snakes. People get about on ships and on horseback. They
eat slaughtered meat and drink beer. As in Scandinavia, north is a difficult direc
tion, and so is east, probably because our mythology comes from west Scandi
navia (Norway and Iceland), where travel to the east required going over
mountains, and going west on a ship was far easier for this seafaring culture.
It is helpful to think of three time periods in which the mythology takes
place. In the mythic past, the æsir created and ordered the world and joined with
another group, the vanir, to make up the community of gods. Somehow this
golden age was disrupted in the mythic present. As dwarfs, humans, and occa
sionally elves look on and are sometimes drawn into the struggle, the æsir and
the jötnar fight over resources, precious objects, and, especially, women. The
flow of such wealth is all in one direction, from the jötnar to the æsir, and in fact
one might divide the narratives of the mythic present into those in which the
gods acquire something from the giants and those in which an attempt by the
giants to acquire something from the gods is foiled. In the mythic future, this
world order will come to a fiery end as gods and giants destroy each other and
the cosmos, but a new world order is to follow in which the world will be reborn
and inhabited by a new generation of æsir.
THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Scandinavia consists of the low-lying Danish islands and the peninsula of Jutland
and the great Scandinavian peninsula, which in its northern reaches is divided in
two by the huge mountain range known as the keel. On the eastern side lies Swe
den with its gentle Baltic Sea coast and a great deal of fertile land, especially in
the central parts of Sweden, around the lakes Mälaren, Vännern, and Vättern, and
to the south. On the west lies Norway, where tall mountains spring from the
coast, which is protected from the Atlantic by a series of small islands. To the
south lies Denmark, which until 1658 included not only Jutland and the islands
2 Norse Mythology



but also southern portions of the Scandinavian peninsula. The names are indica
tive: Norway, the northern way, the sea route up and down the coast; Denmark,
the forest of the Danes, which separated them from the Saxons; Sweden, the
kingdom of the Svear, the people around Mälaren who at some point during the
Viking Age subdued their southern neighbors in Götaland. The name “Scandi
navia” appears to be the Latinized form of an unattested German word, *Scand
inauj  ̄a. (The asterisk before the word means that it was never recorded but rather
was reconstructed by linguists.) This word is a compound, the second part of
which, auja ̄, means “island.” What the first part means has been endlessly
debated. It appears to contain the same root as the name of the southern part of
Sweden, Skåne, and may therefore mean “Skanian island.”
As the ice from the last great Ice Age retreated, the low-lying lands of the
south were first exposed, and pollen analysis indicates settlement on Sjælland
and elsewhere by around 10,000 B.C.E. We know little about these settlements,
but by 6500 B.C.E. or so, a hunting and fishing culture may be identified. By 2500
B.C.E. or so, there are indications of agriculture and the raising of animals. At
around 2000 B.C.E. the archaeological record begins to show characteristic small
ax heads, made of stone but carefully copying the marks of metal pouring that
was used for such axes to the south in Europe. A hypothetical culture associated
with these axes and an even more hypothetical immigration of persons with
them from Europe is known as the Boat-Ax culture. Around 1000 B.C.E. the Scan
dinavian Bronze Age begins, and from this same period there are numerous spec
tacular rock carvings, which may have had a religious purpose. The Scandinavian
Iron Age begins circa 500–400 B.C.E., and its first stage, up to around the begin
ning of our era, is known as the Pre-Roman Iron Age, despite incipient trade with
the Roman Empire. Around the beginning of our era we begin to get runic
inscriptions from Scandinavia and the Continent in a language that is identifi
ably Germanic, and in Scandinavia the so-called Roman Iron Age begins. On the
Continent this is the time when the Germanic peoples confront the Roman
Empire, with increasing success. By around 400 C.E. gold appears in Scandinavia,
and the Germanic Iron Age begins; the Older Germanic Iron Age, from circa 400
to 550 or 575 C.E., is also know as the Migration Period because of the extensive
movements of the Germanic tribes around Europe, as is especially known from
accounts of interaction with Germanic peoples written by Roman historians.
Scandinavia was probably the homeland for some of these peoples. For example,
the Burgundians would appear to have come from the island of Bornholm, the
Goths either from Götaland in Sweden or from the island of Gotland off Swe
den’s east coast, and the Vandals either from the Vendel area of Sweden or what
is now Vendsyssel in Denmark. Part of the Anglo-Saxon immigration to England
probably came from Angeln in what is now Denmark.
Introduction 3



The period circa 600–800 C.E. is usually called the Younger Germanic Iron
Age, although Swedish archaeologists usually called it the Vendel Period
because of the wealth of finds from Vendel, an area northeast of Lake Mälaren.
During this period, too, there was extensive trade from across the Baltic cen
tered at Helgö, then an island in the southern part of Lake Mälaren. And in Den

century C.E. (The Art Archive/Historiska Museet Norway/Dagli Orti)



mark it appears that a Danish state was already beginning to establish itself in
Jutland.
Between circa 600 and 800 C.E., a number of linguistic changes occurred in
the northern area of the Germanic speech community, and by the end of this
period one may speak of Scandinavian languages. By this same time some Scan
dinavians burst spectacularly on the European scene. Although there appears to
have been sporadic raiding before the autumn of 793, in that year Vikings sacked
the rich monastery at Lindisfarne off the east coast of northern England, and for
nearly three centuries Vikings, and later, the Scandinavian kingdoms, would play
a major role in European history. What the word “Viking” originally meant is not
known; the European writers, mostly clergymen, who made it famous painted a
fairly clear picture of pagan marauders who destroyed and despoiled wherever
they went. Certainly there is some truth to such a picture, especially in the early
part of the Viking Age, when the Scandinavian sailors do seem to have had mil
itary advantages, with their light, swift, maneuverable ships. But it is important
to consider that there were individual forays, larger expeditions, armies winter
ing in England and on the Continent, and, finally, the North Sea empire of Cnut
the Great. Besides this military activity there was continuous trade and a pattern
of settlement in the lands to which the Scandinavian ships came.
Some of these lands were already settled, such as the French coast and
northeast England. In Normandy the Scandinavians left relatively little trace,
but in England their influence was great. The creation of the Danelaw—a rela
tively fixed area in which Scandinavian law obtained—arranged by Alfred the
Great and the Danish king Guthrum in the 880s, indicates just how pervasive
the Scandinavian presence was. The enormous number of Scandinavian loan
words into English indicates an extended period of contact between the English
and the Scandinavians, and as the Scandinavian kingdoms began to emerge dur
ing the ninth and tenth centuries, there was not infrequently contact with
English courts. For example, one of the sons of Harald Fairhair of Norway,
Hákon the Good, had been fostered at the court of King Athalstan of England.
According to tradition, Harald had united all Norway into a single kingdom (this
had occurred somewhat earlier in Denmark and would probably happen some
what later in Sweden, for which the sources are rather meager). During the reign
of Harald (870–930) serious emigration began over the sea to the islands to the
west: the Orkneys, the Shetlands, the Faroes, and Iceland. This push was finally
to reach Greenland and North America, and it was paralleled by extensive travel
from Sweden to the east, to Finland and Russia, down the great Russian river
systems to Constantinople and the Black Sea.
According to the Icelandic sources, powerful chieftains fled western Norway
and settled in Iceland in order to avoid the tyranny of Harald Fairhair. There may
Introduction 5



be some truth in this, and even if
Norway was hardly the only
source of immigration into Ice
land, it remained the country
most connected to Iceland and the
kingdom into which Iceland was
finally folded in 1262–1264. But
from the time of the settlement
Iceland was “fully settled” by 897
according to learned authors of
the twelfth century—until then,
Iceland functioned as a common
wealth in which judicial power
was in the hands of a group of
chieftains, and there was no king
or other central authority. These
leaders were called goƒar (sing.,
goƒi), and although the sources
rarely show much religious activ
ity on their part—and what they
do show may not be reliable—the
term clearly incorporates the
word for “gods.” Therefore they
must have had some sort of reli
gious function. Goƒar had “thing
men,” who owed them allegiance and whom they in turn helped; every free
man had to be some goƒi’s thing-man. The word “thing” (πing) means assem
bly, and one of the duties of a goƒi and his thing-men was to attend the local
assemblies and the national assembly (alπingi) to participate in litigation and,
one assumes, to renew friendships and exchange stories. There were few towns
in Scandinavia during the Viking Age and none at all in Iceland, so the assem
blies, and especially the annual national assembly, must have played an impor
tant social role. There, one-third of the law was recited from memory each year
by the only national official in the country, the lawspeaker. The position was
one of status and influence but of little direct power. People lived on farms, and
the basic social unit was the household. So important was this principle of
household membership that people could switch from one household to
another only at certain specified times of the year, the “moving days.” Farming
consisted primarily of raising cattle and the hay that would be needed to sup
port the cattle.

Universitetet)



The Viking Age is by definition a period when Scandinavians and Europeans
interacted, and without that interaction and the written documents it gave rise
to in Europe, archaeologists might have called the period from 800 to circa 1000
the “Scandinavian Iron Age.” The beginning of the period, as we have seen, is
portrayed by those who wrote the history, the literate members of the Christian
church, as a meeting between pagan and Christian, and it was only natural that
as time passed attempts would be made to convert the Scandinavians, as Charle
magne had converted the Saxons. Indeed, those Scandinavians who traded or
settled in Christian lands had ample contact with Christianity, and many of
them either converted or had themselves “prime-signed,” that is, they accepted
the sign of the cross, the first step toward baptism, so that they could do busi
ness with Christians. Furthermore, the gradual emergence of European nation
states in Scandinavia during the Viking Age and their increasing integration with
Europe made it inevitable that the issue would arise at the national level as well.
There is documented missionary activity in Scandinavia from the early Viking
Age onward, most famously by Ansgar, the “apostle of the north,” who worked
with both Danish and Swedish kings in the first half of the ninth century.
The process was to bear fruit first in Denmark in the later tenth century,
when King Harald Bluetooth witnessed the priest Poppo carrying a red-hot piece
of iron, with no harm to his hands, as a demonstration that Christ was greater
than the pagan gods. At Jelling in Jutland, King Harald Bluetooth erected an elab
orate rune stone celebrating his parents and himself, the person who “made the
Danes Christian,” as the Jelling rune stone says.
In Norway there is evidence of Christian burial from around this time, and
Hákon the Good was a Christian king whose reign ended around 960, when Har
ald converted. But Hákon was buried in a mound and celebrated in pagan poetry.
Olaf Tryggvason, who ruled Norway from 995 to 1001, had been baptized in
England, and he undertook a program of forcible conversions throughout the
country. He was of a family from the Oslo fjord, and the most obdurate pagans
were allegedly in the other power center in the country, the area near modern
Trondheim. Credit for the final conversion is given to Olaf Haraldsson. When he
was killed at the battle of Stiklestad in 1030, a battle having far more to do with
national politics than religion—his opponents were supported by Cnut the
Great, the Christian king of Denmark and England—people quickly saw signs of
his sanctity, and he became the most important saint of northern Europe.
We are less well informed about the conversion in Sweden. Although the
kings of Sweden were Christian from the beginning of the eleventh century, the
monk Adam of Bremen, in his history (ca. 1070) of the archbishopric of Hamburg
Bremen in northern Germany, which had responsibility for Scandinavia, reported
a vast pagan temple at Uppsala, with idols of the pagan gods and gruesome sacri

Museum, Stockholm)



fices. But eleventh-century rune stones from that very same part of Sweden are
openly Christian: “God rest his soul,” many of them ask, in runes surrounding
an incised cross. Most historians accept that Sweden was fully Christian by the
beginning of the twelfth century at the latest.
The conversion in Iceland followed a fascinating course. Missionaries were
active in the latter decades of the tenth century, but so were their pagan oppo
nents. Olaf Tryggvason, whose role in the conversion was championed by
twelfth-century and later Icelandic monks, took hostage some wealthy young
Icelandic travelers, and there was further resolve among Christians in Iceland to
complete the conversion. However, as the two sides approached the althingi in
Iceland in the year 1000, it appeared that war would break out. Finally it was
agreed that a single arbiter should choose one religion for the entire land, and the
lawspeaker Thorgeir, a pagan, was chosen. After spending a night under his
cloak, he emerged and decreed that Iceland should be Christian. And so it was.
At first some pagan practices were permitted if carried out in secret, but later
even this permission was rescinded. However, for reasons that are no longer
quite clear, the old stories about the gods were not lost on Iceland. Poems about
them lived on in oral tradition, to be recorded more than two centuries after the
conversion. Some mythological poems may actually have been composed by

Christians in Iceland, and Snorri
Sturluson made extensive use of
the mythology in his writings.
Thus Scandinavian mythol
ogy was, with virtually no excep
tion, written down by Christians,
and there is no reason to believe
that Christianity in Iceland was
any different from Christianity
anywhere else in western Europe
during the High Middle Ages.
Although the earliest bishops were
sent out from Norway, quite soon
the bishops were native born, and
by the end of the eleventh century
there were two episcopal sees, the
original one at Skálholt and a new
one for the north at Hólar. There
were several monasteries, adher
ing both to the Benedictine and
Augustinian orders, and there was
also one nunnery in Iceland before
the demise of the commonwealth
in 1262–1264. At least some of the
monks were literate, and they
composed both Latin and Icelandic
texts. Some lay persons of higher
status were also apparently liter
ate, at least in Icelandic, but all
writing, whether in the interna
tional language of the church or in
the vernacular, was the result of
the conversion to Christianity,
which brought with it the technol
ogy of manuscript writing.
Before and after the church brought manuscript writing to the north, there
was some writing using the native runic writing system. Since in the older runic
alphabet there are no horizontal strokes, it is assumed that the system was orig
inally invented for scratching the letters on wooden sticks, whose grain would
obscure horizontal strokes. Only special circumstances permit wood to remain

undecayed in the ground for archaeologists to dig up centuries later, and as a
result most (but by no means all) of the extant runic inscriptions are on stones.
It is important to stress that carving on wood or stone is a fairly laborious
process and that the kinds of things recorded using the runic alphabets tended to
be short and of a different nature from texts that can be easily written only in
manuscripts. Most runic inscriptions are utilitarian, and despite popular con
ceptions, they have little to say about mythology or magic.
The oldest runic inscriptions are from around the time of the emergence of
the Germanic peoples and are written in an alphabet of 24 characters whose ori
gin is greatly debated. Early in the Viking Age a new runic alphabet developed in
Scandinavia, one with 16 characters. Later several variations grew out of this
basic Viking Age runic alphabet. Of the approximately 4,000 runic inscriptions,
most are from the Viking Age; most of these are from Sweden; and most of these
are from the provinces around Lake Mälaren, especially Uppland. Most are
memorial: They explain who erected the stone, whose death is memorialized,
and what the relationship was between the two. Although the few rune sticks
and other kinds of runic inscriptions that have been retained show that runes

could be used in a great many ways, Scandinavia through the Viking Age was for
all intents and purposes an oral society, one in which nearly all information was
encoded in mortal memory—rather than in books that could be stored—and
passed from one memory to another through speech acts. Some speech acts were
formal in nature, others not. But like speeches that politicians adapt for differ
ent audiences, much ancient knowledge must have been prone to change in oral
transmission. Without the authority of a written document, there was no way to
compare the versions of a text, and we therefore cannot assume that a text
recorded in a thirteenth-century source passed unchanged through centuries of
oral transmission. This fact makes it extremely difficult to discuss with any
authority the time or place of origin of many of the texts of Scandinavian
mythology, especially eddic poetry.
“Eddic poetry” is the name we use for a group of about 35 poems, all of them
recorded in Iceland during the Middle Ages, nearly all in the thirteenth century.
The term “eddic” is a misnomer: Most of these poems are in a single manu
script, and when the learned bishop Brynjólfur Sveinsson first saw this manu
script in the seventeenth century, he perceived a similarity to the book called
Edda by Snorri Sturluson and imagined that this manuscript, another “Edda,”
had been composed by Sæmund Sigfússon the Learned, a priest who flourished
in the years around 1100 and who according to tradition was the first Icelandic
historian, although no works by him have been preserved. This manuscript was
therefore called not only “The Edda of Sæmund” but also the “Elder Edda,”
since Sæmund had lived a century before Snorri. It has been more than a century
since anyone has taken seriously the idea that Sæmund had anything to do with
the composition of this work or that it preceded Snorri, but we still call it
“Edda”: the Poetic Edda. Because the manuscript became part of the collection
of the Royal Library in Copenhagen, we now call it “Codex Regius (royal manu
script) of the Poetic Edda,” and we call the kinds of poems in it “eddic poetry.”
Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, which is now preserved in Iceland, was
written down toward the end of the thirteenth century, probably in the years
around 1280. It appears to be a copy of a now lost manuscript, probably written
circa 1250, and it seems that some of the poems in it may have been written
down as early as the very beginning of the thirteenth century. These are not,
however, the mythological poems. Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda contains 31
poems, sometimes joined or interrupted by prose passages, arranged in a deliber
ate order by the unknown scribe who wrote it, an order that moves from the
mythological to the heroic. It is ordered within the mythological and heroic sec
tions as well.
The manuscript begins with Völuspá (Prophecy of the Seeress), which gives
a summary of the entire mythology, from the origin of the cosmos to its destruc
12 Norse Mythology



tion to its rebirth. Völuspá can also be regarded as an Odin poem, since it is Odin
who causes the seeress voicing it to speak. The following three poems are also
Odin poems: Hávamál (Words of the High One), which contains Odinic wisdom
and several stories that describe the acquisition of that wisdom; Vafthrúdnismál
(Words of Vafthrúdnir), which describes the context of wisdom between Odin and
the wise giant Vafthrúdnir; and Grímnismál (Words of Grímnir), which describes
Odin’s ecstatic wisdom performance at the hall of the human king Geirröd. The
next poem, Skírnismál (Words of Skírnir) or För Skírnis (Skírnir’s Journey),
belongs to Frey, in that it describes the journey of Frey’s servant Skírnir to woo
the giantess Gerd. The following four poems are probably to be assigned to Thor.
The first of these is Hárbardsljód (Song of Hárbard), in which Thor and a dis
guised Odin exchange insults and anecdotes. The next is Hymiskvida (Hymir’s
Poem), an account of Thor’s journey to the giant Hymir and fishing up of the
Midgard serpent. Lokasenna (Loki’s Verbal Duel) follows, and in it Loki insults
all the gods. It is a Thor poem because it is Thor who finally chases Loki away.
The last of the Thor poems is Thrymskvida (The Poem of Thrym), a burlesque in
which Thor, disguised as Freyja, retrieves his hammer from the giant Thrym. The
last two mythological poems are Völundarkvida (Völund’s Poem) and Alvíssmál
Introduction 13
Pages from the famous Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda. (British Library)



(The Words of All-wise). Völundarkvida has no gods in it and to us today looks
like a heroic poem, but the compiler of Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda must
have thought that Völund’s elfish background was good reason to situate the
poem here, elves being creatures from the “lower mythology” (neither of the gods
nor of the giants). Alvíssmál has another such creature in Alvíss, the “all-wise”
dwarf who sues for the hand of Thor’s daughter and is kept dispensing synonyms
by the god until the sun comes up and turns the dwarf to stone.
At this point the heroic poems begin, but the gods are by no means wholly
absent, especially from the poems telling the early parts of the story of Sigurd
the dragon-slayer. Odin, Hœnir, and Loki appear in the prose header to Regins
mál (Reginn’s Poem), and Loki appears in the poem itself. There are several allu
sions to Odin, and these poems contain much fascinating information about
such mythological beings as norns, dwarfs, and the like.
There is a second main manuscript containing many of these poems, but,
unlike Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, it is not apparently ordered. Because it
was retained as manuscript number 748 in the Arnamagnæan Collection in
Copenhagen, it is called AM 748. It was written down a bit later than Codex
Regius of the Poetic Edda. There are few differences between the texts of the
poems in the two manuscripts, but AM 748 contains a mythological poem not
included in Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, namely, Baldrs draumar (Baldr’s
Dreams), an account of Odin’s questioning of a seeress about the fate of Baldr.
One additional mythological poem, Rígsthula (Ríg’s Rhymed List), which tells of
the origins of the human social order, is found in a manuscript of Snorri’s Edda.
Each eddic poem had its own history before it was written down, and there
has been much speculation about the dates and origins of the various poems.
Most scholars believe strongly in the possibility that some of the mythological
poems were composed, after Iceland’s conversion to Christianity, by antiquari
ans secure enough in their Christianity to be able to compose in the old form
about the old gods. Thrymskvida is the poem most often mentioned in this con
text, but there are many others. On the other hand, there is no way to tell
whether a poem, even one that looks as young as Thrymskvida, might have been
composed during the Viking Age or even, theoretically, earlier, and changed in
oral transmission so as to look like the product of a Christian antiquary. What
ever the original dates and origins of the mythological eddic poems, it seems to
me that the similarities outweigh the differences and that the pictures of the
gods are fairly consistent.
In form, the eddic poems are short stanzaic poems that rely chiefly on two
meters, fornyrƒislag, “old way of composing,” and ljóƒaháttr, “song meter.”
Fornyrƒislag is equivalent to the verse form used in Old English, Old High Ger
man, and Old Saxon, the other Germanic languages in which verse has been pre
14 Norse Mythology



served, although the division into stanzas appears to be a Scandinavian innova
tion. Like the poems in the second half of Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, verse
in Old English and Old High German is about heroes, and even the major surviv
ing example of Old Saxon, a verse life of Christ called Heliand (Savior), exhibits
heroic diction. Heroic eddic poetry, then, especially when it uses fornyrƒislag,
appears to be the heir of common Germanic poetry. We may also surmise that
there was verse about gods during the common Germanic period, but only Iceland
has preserved any. Fornyrƒislag tends to be used for third-person narrative,
ljóƒaháttr for dialogue. A version of ljóƒaháttr is called galdralag, “meter of mag
ics,” and its use, although sparing, has considerable stylistic power.
Besides these anonymous mythological and heroic poems, there is far more
verse that has been transmitted to us with the name of a poet attached to it. The
word for “poet” was skáld, and these verses are usually called “skaldic.” They
are far more complex in form than the eddic poems, both with respect to meter
and, in the case of the more complex longer poems, with respect to the structure
of the poem itself. In addition, they use a far more complex diction. The high
degree of formality and complexity make some skaldic verse difficult. Although
a great many skalds are known, ranging from Icelandic saga heroes to bishops,
some of the most famous skalds served at the courts of kings and other power
ful rulers. Sometimes these men gave the skalds valuable gifts, such as a shield,
and if the shield was decorated with scenes taken from narrative, the skald
might compose a poem describing those scenes as thanks for the gift. Such a
shield poem can be of considerable interest in the study of mythology and heroic
legend, for the scenes depicted on shields tended to be from those realms. There
are other examples of this sort of ekphrasis (Greek: “a plain declaration,” in this
context a text about an image) in the skaldic corpus, such as Úlf Uggason’s Hús
drápa, which describes carvings in a newly built hall in late-tenth-century Ice
land. In some cases we lack the context of a poem but can surmise the existence
of an ekphrasis.
Skaldic poetry is retained as individual verses not (apparently) connected
with any poem and as fragmentary or whole poems. The most elaborate poems
are called drápur (sing., drápa), which are broken into sections by means of one
or more refrains, which here means lines repeated in the same place within a
given stanza. A drápa should also have introductory and concluding sections
that lack the refrain(s). I will translate drápa in this book as “refrain poem.” A
poem without refrains was called a flokkr, “flock.”
The earliest known skald is ordinarily taken to be Bragi Boddason the Old,
whom most scholars think was Norwegian and active in the second half of the
ninth century. According to Snorri, he was associated with the semilegendary
Viking Ragnar Lodbrók (Hairy-breeches). Fragments of a poem addressed to Rag
Introduction 15



nar, Ragnarsdrápa, exist. The poem, as we have it reconstructed, describes four
scenes on the shield Ragnar gave Bragi, and three of these have to do with the
mythology: Thor’s fishing up the Midgard serpent, Gefjon’s plowing land from
Gylfi, and Hild’s inciting Högni and Hedin to endless battle.
Another early Norwegian skald was Thjódólf of Hvin, who flourished
around the end of the ninth and beginning of the tenth century and was patron
ized by several Norwegian rulers. Two of the poems attributed to him are impor
tant mythological sources. Of these, the first is Ynglinga tal (Enumeration of the
Ynglingar), which Thjódólf composed for Rögnvald heidumheiri (Honored
highly) Óláfsson, a king from the important Vestfold district in the Oslo fjord.
Ynglinga tal lists the ways that 22 generations of the Ynglingar, kings centered
in Uppsala and predecessors of Rögnvald, met their deaths and where they were
buried. The poem clearly originally served a dynastic purpose, but, especially in
its discussion of the earliest kings, it has much to tell us about mythology and
religion. Thjódólf also composed the shield poem Haustlöng (Autumn-long,
which may refer to the poem’s gestation period). He describes two mythological
scenes that adorned the shield: Loki’s betrayal of Idun and her apples to the giant
Thjazi and her rescue, and Thor’s duel with Hrungnir, the strongest of the giants.
From the earliest skaldic tradition come three “eddic praise poems,” poems
in eddic meters (but in which the meters are ordinarily more strictly adhered to
than in eddic poems proper), composed to honor not gods or ancient heroes but
recently deceased kings. Two of these describe Valhöll in connection with the
arrival there of the king the poet wishes to praise. One, the anonymous Eiríksmál,
was allegedly commissioned by Gunnhild, the widow of King Eirík Haraldsson
Bloodax, who died in 954. The other, attributed to Eyvind Finnsson skáldaspillir
(Spoiler-or-debaser-of-poets), praises Hákon the Good, who died in 961.
Úlf Uggason was an Icelandic skald who lived around the tumultuous period
of the conversion. Around 985, according to the chronology of Laxdœla saga, Úlf
composed a drápa celebrating the building of an ornate hall by Óláf pái (Pea
cock), an important chieftain in western Iceland. The hall was decorated within
with scenes from the mythology. Three of the scenes are in what we now think
we have of the poem, which Úlf recited at the wedding of Óláf’s daughter. These
are Baldr’s funeral, Thor’s fishing up of the Midgard serpent, and Loki’s fight
with Heimdall.
Another skald who lived during this period was Eilíf Godrúnarson, about
whom nothing is known—not even his nationality—other than that he was
patronized by Hákon Sigurdarson, jarl of Hladir, a notorious pagan. Eilíf com
posed Thórsdrápa, a complex and difficult account of Thor’s journey to Geirröd.
Besides these poems treating mythological subjects, there are numerous
other relevant texts and fragments. A poem like Sonatorrek (Loss of Sons) by Egil
16 Norse Mythology



Skallagrímsson, the tenth-century hero of Egils saga, may tell us something
about his own religious attitudes. “Rán has robbed me greatly,” he says, allud
ing to the drowning death of one of his sons.
In skaldic poetry, Thor is the most frequent mythological subject. The most
tantalizing of these are two verses addressing Thor in the second person, both
probably from the last years of paganism in Iceland.
Skaldic poetry is valuable not just for the direct exposition of mythological
subjects but also for its very diction. The primary stylistic feature is the kenning,
a two or more part substitution for a noun. Kennings consist of a base word (e.g.,
“tree”) and a modifier (“of battle”). What is a “tree of battle”? This figure is
indeed something like a riddle. Because he stands tall in a battle, a “tree of
battle” is a warrior. What is the “din of spears”? Because battles are noisy affairs,
the “din of spears” is battle. Kennings are known from eddic poetry and the verse
of the other older Germanic languages, but they took on a special importance in
skaldic poetry because skalds linked them by using one kenning as the modifier
of a base word to create another, for example, “tree of the din of spears” for war
rior. The examples I have chosen so far are relatively obvious, but skalds also
made kennings based on narrative, that is, on heroic legend and myth. For ex
ample, they called gold “the headpiece of Sif,” which is only comprehensible if
one knows the myth in which Loki cuts off Sif’s hair and has the dwarfs make
golden hair to replace it. Kennings can be helpful in dating myths, for a kenning
that relies on a myth indicates the myth was known to the skald and his audi
ence at a given time. Seeing whether a minor god or goddess is used in the base
word of a kenning—for example, “Gná of rings” for woman—can give us some
indication as to whether the figure in question was at all known.
Skaldic poetry, then, was a showy, ornate oral poetry, which must have
taken much time to master; indeed, it is clear that a certain amount of training
would have been needed just to understand it as a member of the audience. It is
certainly possible that knowledge of the myths survived the conversion to Chris
tianity because of the value early Christian Iceland placed on the skaldic poems
about kings and rulers. In other words, it is possible that the continued trans
mission of poetry about early kings and battles as historical sources required a
continuing knowledge of heroic legend and of myth, not as the object of belief or
as something associated with cult but simply as stories that people interested in
the history of their own culture had to know. In the same way, students today
may study the Bible to be able to understand allusions in older literature. It is
even possible to imagine that eddic poems continued to be recited for their nar
rative value in support of the kenning system, although once belief in the older
gods had ended, they could also be recited purely by and for those who enjoyed
a good story.
Introduction 17



Certainly such a motivation associates the earliest recording of eddic and
skaldic poetry and the systematization of the mythology by Snorri Sturluson.
Snorri was born during the winter of 1178–1179 into a wealthy family, the
Sturlungar, who were to give their name to the turbulent age in which Snorri
lived: the Age of the Sturlungs. He grew up at Oddi, the foster son of the most
powerful man in Iceland; one of his foster brothers was to become bishop, and
Snorri himself was a goƒi and twice held the office of lawspeaker. Through var
ious alliances he soon grew to be one of the most powerful men of his time, and
he was deeply involved in the politics of the Age of the Sturlungs. During this
time politics became increasingly deadly, and many disputes were settled with
weapons. Snorri was assassinated in 1241 by enemies who claimed to be work
ing on behalf of the king of Norway.
Snorri had visited that king, Hákon Hákonarson the Old, in 1218–1219, and
he composed a poem in praise of the boy king and his regent, the jarl Skuli. This
poem is called Háttatal (Enumeration of Meters), and it exemplifies 101 metrical
or stylistic variants in its 102 stanzas, equipped with a commentary. From an
explication of meter and style, it seems, he moved to a discussion of the system
of kennings and rare or poetic words and names called “heiti,” which he embod
ied in a treatise called Skáldskaparmál (The Language of Poetry). This text com
prises for the most part lists of kennings and heiti arranged by the nouns they can
replace, illustrated with a large number of citations from skaldic poetry, quoting
in blocks of half a stanza. But besides this, he used a narrative frame to retell
some of the more important myths that underlie skaldic kennings. According to
this frame, a man named Ægir or Hlér from Hlésey (“Hlér’s Island,” modern
Læssø off the Danish coast), a master of magic, goes to Ásgard, where the æsir
receive him well but with visual delusions. The hall is illuminated by swords
alone. Twelve male and twelve female æsir are there. Ægir sits next to Bragi, who
tells Ægir many stories of events in which the æsir have participated. The first
of these is the full story of the alienation and recovery of Idun and her apples, the
death of Thjazi, and the compensation granted to Skadi. When Bragi has finished,
he and Ægir have a short conversation about a few kennings, and then Ægir asks
Bragi the origin of poetry, which elicits the story of the origin and acquisition by
Odin of the mead of poetry. At the end of this story Ægir puts questions and Bragi
answers them in a way that looks very much like the master-disciple dialogue
that so typifies didactic texts in the Middle Ages. Scholars pay special attention
to this dialogue, for it sets forth more clearly than in any other place some of the
principles of skaldic poetry. After it there follows a paragraph inviting young
skalds to pay attention to the narratives that follow if they wish to learn skaldic
poetry, but reminding them that Christians are not to believe in pagan gods or
the literal truth of the narratives. This can hardly be Bragi’s voice; rather, it is
18 Norse Mythology



that of Snorri or, arguably, one of his copyists, and it intrudes on the framing
device of a dialogue between Ægir and Bragi. That device is taken up again when
Snorri introduces the story of Thor’s duel with Hrungnir and of Thor’s journey to
Geirröd, but thereafter it is dropped. Additional mythic narratives in Skáldska
parmál include the acquisition from one set of dwarfs of Sif’s golden hair, the
ship Skídbladnir, Odin’s spear Gungnir, Odin’s ring Draupnir, Frey’s boar
Gullinborsti, and Thor’s hammer Mjöllnir, and the subsequent acquisition from
another dwarf of the gold and cursed ring that play a large role in heroic legend.
A good deal of heroic legend is also recounted in Skáldskaparmál.
It seems that Snorri next was moved to write up the rest of the myths and
to do so with a frame story consistently carried out. The result was Gylfaginning
(Deluding of Gylfi). Here the frame story has a Swedish king, Gylfi, come to visit
Ásgard. He does so because he has heard that all goes to the will of the æsir, and
he wishes to determine whether it is because of their own nature or because of
the gods whom they worship. A wise man with a control of magic, he assumes
the form of an old man. But the æsir were wiser in that they possessed the power
of prophecy, and, foreseeing his journey, they prepared visual delusions for him.
He thinks he arrives at a great hall, and, assuming the name Gangleri, he meets
the chieftains there, Hár (High), Jafnhár (Equally-high), and Thridi (Third) and
declares his intention to determine whether there is any learned man there. Hár
says that Gangleri will not emerge whole if he is not the wiser, and a series of
questions and answers ensues, the questions put by Gylfi/Gangleri, the answers
given by usually by Hár with occasional amplification by Jafnhár or Thridi.
These questions treat the mythology: first the issue of a supreme deity; then the
creation of the cosmos, the identity of the gods and goddesses and some of the
myths attaching to them, and then myths untreated there or in Skáldskaparmál;
and finally Ragnarök and its aftermath. Then Gylfi/Gangleri hears a crash, and
the hall disappears.
Snorri quotes liberally from eddic poetry in Gylfaginning, especially from
Völuspá, Vafthrúdnismál, and Grímnismál. The arrangement of the subjects he
treats, following the discussion of the “highest and foremost of the gods,” which
is Gylfi/Gangleri’s first question, is essentially that of Völuspá in its sweep from
beginning to end of mythic time. Snorri also seems to have known eddic poems
beyond those he quotes, and he also paraphrases myths that he probably knew
from skaldic poetry; but he quotes no skaldic poetry outside the device of the
frame, at the beginning of Gylfaginning.
If the arrangement of materials to some extent follows Völuspá, the frame
story itself is reminiscent especially of Vafthrúdnismál and other contests of
wisdom. We learn Gylfi’s motivation for his journey, and he conceals his name.
Hár stipulates a wager of heads, but this motif is dropped; indeed, the nearest
Introduction 19



King Gylfi of Sweden questions Hár, Jafnhár, and Thridi, from DG 11, a fourteenth-century
manuscript containing Snorri Sturluson’s Prose Edda. (Werner Forman/Art Resource)



analogy to the hall’s disappearance at the end of the text is Thor’s visit to
Útgarda-Loki, not any myth of Odin. Gylfi takes the Odin-role in this contest of
wisdom, as the traveler under an assumed name, and indeed this assumed name,
Gangleri, is one of Odin’s in Grímnismál, stanza 46 and elsewhere. This is some
what ironic, since Hár, Jafnhár, and even Thridi are also names of Odin, the lat
ter two also in Grímnismál. But as we shall see, Hár, Jafnhár, and Thridi
probably also, in Snorri’s view, were no more Odin than Gylfi was.
These three sections, in the opposite order from the one in which I just pre
sented them (i.e., Gylfaginning, Skáldskaparmál, Háttatal) and probably in the
opposite order from the one in which Snorri wrote them, make up, with a pro
logue, Snorri’s Edda, as the work is called in one of its manuscripts. The mean
ing of this word is not clear, but it seems to have to do with Latin edo, in the
sense “to compose,” and probably therefore meant something like “Poetics.”
Certainly Snorri’s Edda, as a whole, is first and foremost a handbook of poetics,
even if it is now far more famous as an explication of mythology.
As I have mentioned, Skáldskaparmál contains a warning to young skalds
about the pagan nature of the material. It seems that Snorri wished to make this
statement more forcefully, and he did so in the prologue to his Edda. Here, too,
he advances his understanding of the historical nature of the gods and gives us
the key to understanding Gylfaginning. Snorri starts the prologue to his Edda by
stating, “Almighty God created heaven and earth and all things that accompany
them, and finally two people, from whom genealogies are reckoned, Adam and
Eve, and their progeny multiplied and went all around the world.” Ultimately,
however, after the Flood, people lost sight of God, but they observed that there
were similarities and yet differences among humans, animals, and the earth, and
they began to trace their genealogies from earth. And seeing the importance of
the heavenly bodies for time reckoning, they assumed that some being had
ordered the course of these bodies and probably existed before they did and
might rule all things. This knowledge they possessed was worldly knowledge,
for they lacked spiritual knowledge.
This is medieval speculation on the origin of paganism, and it ascribes to
pagans a kind of natural religion, one based on unenlightened observation of the
environment. It was especially attractive to Icelanders like Snorri, who traced
their genealogies from pagans and for whom the conversion of their land to
Christianity was a relatively recent event. The first extant work of Icelandic his
tory writing is a little treatise called Íslendingabók (Book of Icelanders), by the
priest Ari Thorgilsson the Learned, who wrote about a century before Snorri did,
and it is plain that for Ari the conversion was the most important event in the
history of the Icelanders. In the Sagas of Icelanders, which were composed for the
most part in the thirteenth century but which are often set in pagan Iceland, the
Introduction 21



“noble heathen” is a stock character. All that conversion required, according to
this theory of natural religion, was for Icelanders to regain sight of God. Unlike
the pagans whom Icelanders learned about when they translated and read the
lives of the early saints of the Christian church, Nordic pagans were not doomed
souls in league with Satan. They were merely sheep who had lost their way.
Snorri now adds a historical dimension to his prologue. After presenting a
standard medieval view of the world as consisting of Africa, Europe, and Asia, he
says that near the center of the earth, in Tyrkland, lies the city of Troy. A king
there was called Múnón or Mennón, who was married to Tróan, the daughter of
King Priam; their son was Trór, “whom we call Thor.” He was raised by Duke
Loricus, whom he subsequently killed, and he took over the kingdom of Loricus,
Trákía (Thrace), “which we call Thrúdheim. Then he traveled widely from coun
try to country, explored the entire continent, and alone defeated all berserks and
all giants and the greatest dragon and many animals.” He married Síbil, a seer
ess, “whom we call Sif.” He begat an entire family, and eighteen generations
later was born Vóden; “we call that one Odin.”
Troy was a known place, and Agamemnon and Priam were historical figures
known in Iceland from the twelfth century onward. Snorri sets Thor in that
environment; that is, he tells us that there was a historical figure whom the
Nordic peoples called Thor who lived before Christ was born and who performed
historical acts (it is important to remember that berserks and dragons were not
as fantastic to medieval historians as they seem to us) that look very much like
some of the myths about Thor that later were to be told by the Nordic peoples.
The idea that gods derive from humans whose actions are reinterpreted and
deified by later generations is called “euhemerism,” after the Greek philosopher
Euhemeros (fl. 300 B.C.E.), whose claim to have discovered an inscription show
ing that Zeus was a mortal king elevated to deity was generalized into a theory
that has had considerable currency down into modern times.
Snorri’s euhemerism in the prologue to his Edda continues with Odin,
whose gift of prophecy informs him that his future lies to the north. He sets off
from Tyrkland with a large band of followers, young and old, men and women,
and they brought many precious things with them. Wherever they went people
said great things about them, “so that they seemed more like gods than
humans.” Odin tarries for a while in Saxony and there sets up his sons as kings.
For example, Beldeg, “whom we call Baldr,” he makes king of Westphalia. Trav
eling through Reidgotaland, “which is now called Jutland,” he establishes the
Skjöldungar as the kings of Denmark. His final destination is Sweden. “That
king is there who is named Gylfi. And when he hears of the journey of those
Asia-men, who were called æsir, he went to meet them and invited Odin to take
as much power in his kingdom as he wished, and those good times went with
22 Norse Mythology



them, that wherever they stayed in lands, there was peace and prosperity, and
everyone believed that they were the cause of that.” Odin settles in Sigtúnir
(modern Sigtuna, on Lake Mälaren south of Uppsala) and establishes his sons
Sæming as king of Norway and Yngvi as king of Sweden after him.
Although the medieval Icelandic word æsir (sing., áss) etymologically has
nothing to do with Asia, the derivation of the æsir from Asia-men completed the
euhemeristic process. Snorri tells us who the historical figures were who were
deified by his ancestors, and he alleviates somewhat the peripheral northern
location of Scandinavia by associating it with the ancient center of the world. It
is not difficult to imagine that Gylfaginning represents the first encounter
between Gylfi and the Asia-men and that Gylfi’s delusion was in accepting that
the stories told to him by Hár, Jafnhár, and Thridi were about gods. In other
words, it is easy to believe that Snorri wishes us to believe that Gylfi’s meeting
with the æsir contributed to their euhemerization. This theory makes it possible
for a learned Christian author to retell and order mythological narratives of his
forefathers in a handbook of poetry; the myths in Gylfaginning are told by the
Asia-men Hár, Jafnhár, and Thridi (none of whom needs to be Odin), just as the
myths in Skáldskaparmál are told by Bragi, a known skald.
Snorri’s Edda is thus very much a document of its time, the Christian
Middle Ages, and also of its place, an island where the older poetry, for whatever
reason, was still transmitted. As it happens, Skáldskaparmál quotes much
skaldic poetry known from nowhere else, and without it our notion of the genre
would be much poorer. And manuscripts of Snorri’s Edda also contain system
atic lists of synonyms called “thulur,” doubtless copied there because of the
reliance of skaldic poetry on kennings and heiti.
Snorri is also the author of another work, a vast compilation of lives of the
kings of Norway known as Heimskringla (The Orb of the Earth). Other similar
compilations were undertaken in the thirteenth century, but Snorri’s is unique
in that it starts with prehistory. The first saga in it, Ynglinga saga, follows
Thjódólf of Hvin’s Ynglinga tal and expands or paraphrases it in places, but the
saga begins before Ynglinga tal does, at Troy in Tyrkland. Thor is not in this ver
sion, however, as he is in the prologue to Snorri’s Edda. Additional information
not found in the Edda prologue is that Vanaland or Vanaheim—the land or world
of the vanir—lay along the river Tanais, that is, the Don. To the east lay Ásaland
or Ásaheim—the land or world of the æsir—whose capital was Ásgard, a great
place of sacrifice. Odin was the chieftain who ruled there, and the opening chap
ters of Ynglinga saga are very much about Odin. Snorri starts the euhemerism in
this text by reporting that Odin was constantly victorious, which led his men to
believe that if he had “blessed” them before battle they would emerge victori
ous, and they began to call his name when they were in trouble. From this they
Introduction 23



got relief, and all their consolation was in him, as Snorri puts it, using vocabu
lary that is strongly religious. So end the first two chapters.
Chapter 3 of Ynglinga saga mentions Odin’s long journeys away and the
story of his brothers Vili and Vé taking his inheritance and his wife Frigg during
one particularly long absence.
Chapter 4 of Ynglinga saga offers the fullest account of the war between the
æsir and vanir, understood here of course as a historical conflict. The exchange
of hostages is present, although with slightly different details. However, the
mixing of spittle and creation of the mead of poetry are wholly absent, doubtless
in keeping with Snorri’s historical project here. Mímir’s head is sent back to the
æsir and pickled by Odin and used for divination, but we must accept that Snorri
found such a concept within historical possibility. He would have been aided in
such a supposition by the veneration and use of relics within Christian Europe
of the Middle Ages. Also as part of the settlement after the war between the æsir
and vanir, Njörd, Frey, and Freyja join the æsir, and Freyja brings the magic art
of seid, a form of sorcery and divination, associated in the mythology especially
with Odin. Brother-sister incest, which was practiced among the vanir, is
dropped when they join the æsir, and Snorri may wish us to believe that the æsir
were morally to be preferred to the vanir, even if both groups were pagan.
Chapter 5 describes the emigration from Tyrkland, again motivated by
Odin’s seeing that his future lay to the north. Again he goes through Saxony, but
this time he stops in Ódinsey (modern Odense on the Danish island of Fyn) and
sends Gefjon to look for land. The story of her plowing up land from Gylfi and
the quotation of the Gefjon stanza by Bragi Boddason the Old are also in
Gylfaginning, although again the narrative details are slightly different. “Odin
and Gylfi contested much in tricks and illusions, and the æsir always were the
more powerful,” Snorri writes, in an apparent allusion to the euhemeristic frame
of Gylfaginning. Odin settled at Sigtúnir, and, as in the prologue to Snorri’s
Edda, he established other æsir in their dwelling places.
Chapters 6 and 7 focus on Odin’s characteristics and comprise a significant
description of him. To his friends he appeared fair of countenance, but to his ene
mies fierce and grim. He spoke only in verse, and poetry arose from him and his
chieftains. In battle he could make his enemies blind or deaf or overcome with
fear, but his warriors could go berserk. He was a shape-changer, his body lying
apparently inert while he was off and about in some animal form. Here I see the
key to this “historical” Odin of Snorri, for this is a classic description of a
shamanic trance and journey. If Snorri’s historical Odin was a shaman from
Tyrkland, he was just a charismatic version of the Sámi shamans who are
described in the medieval Scandinavian historical record. To cite but one ex
ample among a great many, Historia Norvegiae (History of Norway), a work
24 Norse Mythology



composed presumably in Norway before 1211, describes a shamanic trance and
journey to the world of the spirits witnessed by Norwegian traders among the
Sámi people in the Norwegian mountains. The author describes the event as
though it were fact, as indeed it was for medieval Scandinavians. Odin did not
have to be a god to do what Snorri has him do in Ynglinga saga. Snorri says
explicitly that Odin was a master of seid, which surely refers to the shamanic
arts. “His enemies feared him, but his friends relied on him and believed in his
strength and in Odin himself.” So Snorri expressed his euhemerism at this point.
And he extended it by reporting that Odin and his chieftains taught their skills
to others, which I take to be an attempt on Snorri’s part to account for shaman
ism among the Sámi. Snorri knew from the saga record (and wrote later about
such subjects in Heimskringla) that Icelanders, too, had practiced seid during the
pagan period, and his historical theory therefore must have been that shaman
ism originated with Odin and was lost by the Scandinavians upon conversion to
Christianity but was retained by the Sámi, who were unconverted in his time.
In chapter 8 Snorri writes that Odin established various pagan customs, pri
marily cremation funerals, but also various sacrifices. In chapter 9 Odin dies, not
in the jaws of a monstrous wolf but of old age. He has himself marked with the
point of a spear and gathered for himself all the warriors felled by weapons. He
said he wished to go to Godheim or Godheimar, and from this the Swedes con
cluded, according to Snorri, that Odin had gone to ancient Ásgard and would live
there until eternity. “Belief in Odin and calling on him grew up anew.” Snorri
must have imagined that Godheim was a historical land, misunderstood by the
Swedes in connection with their euhemerism, for goƒ is a word for pagan gods.
Subsequently in Ynglinga saga he has two of the kings of the Ynglingar set out
to look for Godheim, to the east in “Greater Sweden.”
Njörd ruled the Swedes after Odin. He was followed by Frey, who made
Uppsalir (modern Uppsala) the capital. His was a reign of peace and prosperity,
the “Peace of Fródi” according to Snorri. Because of this he was worshipped even
more than other goƒ. When Snorri uses a word for pagan gods here, he must feel
that the euhemerization of the æsir had been completed. Frey is the first of the
Ynglingar, and his successor, Fjölnir, is the first king cataloged in Thjódólf’s
Ynglinga tal. From this point, Ynglinga saga follows Ynglinga tal closely, and
the strictly mythological section is at an end. However, the rest of Ynglinga
saga, and other parts of Heimskringla as well, also contains information that is
useful for the study of Scandinavian mythology.
Eddic and skaldic poetry, Snorri’s Edda, and Ynglinga saga are the most
important direct sources of Scandinavian mythology, and as I have shown, each
has its history and is anchored, either by recording or composition, in thir
teenth-century Christian Iceland. Iceland recorded its older traditions with
Introduction 25



extraordinary diligence, and within this large vernacular literature there is
much that is of interest for the study of Scandinavian mythology, especially
among the sagas.
The word saga is related to the verb “to say” and in medieval Icelandic
means both “history” and “narrative.” There are many kinds of sagas, of which
one category, for example, comprises sagas of the Norwegian kings of the sort
that are in Heimskringla. The other most important saga genres are the mythic
heroic sagas (fornaldarsögur, literally “sagas of an ancient age”; sg., fornal
darsaga) and the Sagas of Icelanders (Íslendingasögur). The mythic-heroic sagas
are an amorphous lot joined essentially by being set long ago or far away, that is,
before the settlement of Iceland or in the Viking lands to the east. Gods appear
as characters in such mythic-heroic sagas as Völsunga saga, in part a retelling of
some of the heroic materials of the second half of Codex Regius of the Poetic
Edda, or Gautreks saga, which tells of an assembly of the gods to set the fate of
the hero Starkad. The Sagas of Icelanders recount no myths but rather are seem
ingly sober accounts of events carried out mostly in Iceland during the pagan
period. As a result of this time setting, they sometimes give information about
paganism, such as the account of the pagan temple in Eyrbyggja saga or of a
horse sacred to Frey in Hrafnkels saga. Scholars agree that one must proceed
with care in using such accounts, since they may include antiquarian recon
structions of the past, but as we have seen, such caution must be used with vir
tually every text of Scandinavian mythology.
Some other vernacular texts are also of interest. Short independent texts are
usually called thættir (sing., tháttr), which etymologically means “thread” and
suggests the interweaving of such texts in larger works, as would be the case
when they were recorded in manuscripts. Some of these are quite relevant to the
subject. For example, Sörla tháttr tells how Freyja acquired the Brísinga men, a
torque or necklace, by sleeping with dwarfs in order to outwit a cunning Loki
who is Odin’s liege man. Whereas Sörla tháttr seems like a mythic-heroic saga,
Thidranda tháttr ok Thórhalls shares the setting of the Sagas of Icelanders and
presents some of the evidence regarding the dísir, female spirits.
Not all the important source material is from Iceland or even in the vernac
ular. An extremely important source is Gesta Danorum, a Danish history writ
ten by the priest Saxo Grammaticus (that is, “the Grammarian”). Little is known
about Saxo, other than that he came from a family of warriors, probably in Jut
land, and that he was a member of the household of Absalon, who was arch
bishop of Lund from 1178–1201. Some of the Gesta seems to have been written
before the death of Absalon; the rest was probably completed after 1216, or in
other words, just a few years before Snorri began his mythological project. Saxo’s
history consists of 16 books, of which the first 8 treat pagan Denmark and the
26 Norse Mythology



second 8, Christian Denmark. The first books are therefore, like Ynglinga saga,
set in prehistory, and gods and heroes play a major role that continues down
through the ninth book. Saxo offered a theory of euhemerism similar to that of
Snorri, for he says in book 1 that Odin was a man falsely believed to be a god.
Höd has become a human king, but Baldr is a demigod, and sometimes Saxo
seems to be far more interested in the narratives he is recounting than in any
theory of euhemerism. Saxo tells us he got some of his materials from Ice
landers, and these materials probably sounded rather like the mythic-heroic
sagas. The mythic-heroic sagas are prose with interspersed verse, and Saxo
adorns his Latin prose with verse, often rather ornate but still thought to be
translated from Scandinavian originals.
Certainly the versions of the myths he presents often vary widely from the
versions we have from Iceland. To use the example of Baldr’s death: In Saxo’s ver
sion, Baldr and Höd are not brothers but rivals for the hand of Nanna, a human
beauty. Höd is not blind—indeed, he is a most accomplished fellow. Neither
Loki nor Frigg appears in the story, and there is no mistletoe. No attempt is made
to restore Baldr from the world of the dead, and he enjoys only an attenuated
funeral. Saxo’s story adds some odd forest maidens and some magic food and sets
the death of Baldr in the context of several pitched battles between the forces of
Baldr and Höd. Yet Saxo’s version does include disquieting dreams, Baldr’s invul
nerability, and, perhaps most important, the linked story of the siring of an
avenger by Odin on Rind (Rinda in Saxo). The extent to which the variation
between Saxo’s version and the Icelandic sources represents differences between
Danish and Icelandic traditions, as opposed to variation within Icelandic tradi
tion reported to Saxo, has never been fully sorted out and probably never will be.
Besides these and a host of other written sources, from inside and outside
Scandinavia and in languages ranging from English to Arabic, there are valuable
nonwritten sources. Of these the most important is surely the archaeological
record. We have, for example, numerous representations from the Viking Age of
the encounter between Thor and the Midgard serpent, from Scandinavia and also
from England. We have numerous small hammer-shaped amulets, which must be
representations in the human world of the protective power conferred by Thor’s
hammer. We even have dies for casting such hammers and for casting Christian
crosses, an eloquent piece of testimony to the mission and conversion. Some
small objects with human form have been interpreted as representations of vari
ous gods in sculpture. Although these carvings and objects are understood by
application of the texts, archaeologists are quite confident in their identifications,
and our understanding of Scandinavian mythology would be less rich without
them. Some adventurous scholars have even attempted to work from archaeolog
ical artifacts back to the mythology, for example, by using the illustrations on
Introduction 27



Migration Period bracteates (small brooches) to reconstruct a set of hypothetical
myths about Odin as a healing god.
An example of the importance of the text-object relationship is the large
number of small pieces of stamped gold foil that are increasingly being
unearthed in apparent cult contexts from Viking Age sites in Scandinavia. Some
times these portray a man and woman, but there is no direct connection to any
text. These fascinating objects belong to the study of the history of religion, but
not yet to the study of Scandinavian mythology.
Finally, in discussing the sources of our knowledge of Scandinavian mythol
ogy, I must mention etymology (the study of the origin and historical develop
ment of words), especially in the study of place-names. Etymology can help us
understand the original nature of a god by asking about the meaning of the name
of a god in Proto-Germanic, the language of the Germanic peoples around the
start of our era, or in Proto-Indo-European, the parent language of Proto
Germanic. Neither of these languages has left any texts, and what we know of
them is reconstructed by linguists. For example, according to linguists, the name
“Odin,” medieval Icelandic Óƒinn, derives from a word that would mean some
thing like “leader of the possessed.” We cannot be sure what Ty ́r’s name meant
28 Norse Mythology

Museum of Denmark)



Stamped gold foil from Norway depicts embracing figures. (Historisk Museum, Bergen
Universitetet)



in Proto-Germanic, but in Proto-Indo-European it was probably a word for “god”
or “sky.” This may suggest that Ty ́r is an older god than Odin, but such a sur
mise hardly helps us to understand texts recorded more than a millennium after
Proto-Germanic was theoretically spoken and more than two millennia after
Proto-Indo-European was spoken. And although it is instructive that Odin’s
name originally may have meant “leader of the possessed,” we cannot assume
that Viking Age or later Scandinavians were aware of that fact, and even if we
knew they were aware of it, we would still use that fact only as one detail in
building up a complete interpretation of Odin.
Most of the place-names of Scandinavia are very old, and over time they
have changed enough that only etymology can recover the original meaning.
Thus, for example, Copenhagen (Danish København) originally meant “mer
chants’ harbor.” Not a few place-names originally contained the names of gods,
and the distribution in time and space of these names can tell us much. Nearly
all of these theophoric (referring to a deity) names are compounds, in which the
name of the god is followed by a noun referring to a natural or cultural feature
of the landscape. For example, there are several places in Denmark called “Tor
shøj,” “Thor’s hill,” and the major city of the Danish island Fyn is Odense,
which originally meant “Odin’s holy place.” Scholars usually distinguish
“nature-names” from “cult-names,” but the distinction is not as clear as the pre
vious pair of words suggests.
THE INDO-EUROPEAN BACKGROUND
The Germanic languages, of which English, German, Dutch, and the Scandina
vian languages are the modern representatives, constitute one branch of the
Indo-European family of languages. The name “Indo-European” was coined
when the family relationship between Sanskrit, the classic literary language of
India, and Greek and Latin, the classic literary languages of Europe, was discov
ered in the eighteenth century. Most of the languages of modern Europe fall into
the Indo-European category, which includes the Germanic, Romance (French,
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Romanian), Slavic (Russian, Polish,
Ukrainian, Czech, Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian), Celtic (Irish, Welsh, Manx, and
Breton), and Baltic (Lithuanian, Latvian) groups. Finnish and Hungarian are the
two national languages of Europe that are not Indo-European; Sámi and Basque
represent two other non-Indo-European languages spoken in modern Europe.
Language branches (like Germanic) and families (like Indo-European) are
reconstructed on the basis of careful comparison of sounds, words, and gram
matical forms. Only such comparison makes possible the etymological research
30 Norse Mythology



I discussed above. Going on the assumption that shared language meant shared
culture, scholars also tried cultural comparison, and one area in which such
comparison was common in the nineteenth century was myth and religion. But
although persons who studied comparative mythology were extremely erudite,
they did not apply the same rigor to this subject as was used in comparative lin
guistics. The goal of linguistic comparison was reconstruction of a given lan
guage at an earlier state; similarly, comparative mythology hoped to lead to
reconstruction of older states of a mythology or, in the Indo-European area, of
the myths and conceptions of the hypothetical ancestors of the Indic, Germanic,
and other Indo-European peoples from around 2,000 years ago. The project was
doomed from the start, however, by notions of what myths were about. Few
people thought that a particular sound “meant” something in and of itself. That
is, for example, the sound that turned up as ç in Sanskrit, c [= k] in Latin, and h
in Germanic was not thought to be anything other than the reflection of a k in
Proto-Indo-European, a sound whose meaning was always arbitrary. In myth,
however, the situation was quite different. Comparative mythology in the nine
teenth century was above all a field driven by interpretations of myths as reflec
tions of natural phenomena, primarily involving the sun, moon, fire, storms, and
so forth. This nature mythology was taken as a kind of given, and bits and pieces
of myths from all over the world were put to its service. There was no way to
test the theory, since even if a bit of mythological lore was taken from a living
people, nobody bothered to ask them what they thought it meant, and in fact the
comparative method allowed one to ignore living beings, since change could
have obscured the original meaning of something.
Although Adalbert Kuhn was an important early adherent of nature mythol
ogy, the person most closely associated with it today is Max Müller, a German
Indo-Europeanist resident in England who was widely read and very influential
for the entire second half of the nineteenth century. Müller’s theory of myth was
actually based on the notion of a “disease of language,” the idea that language
itself was inadequate to express everything it had to and therefore was a major
contributor to the development of gods and myths, which grew out of linguistic
confusion. Müller was an ardent solar mythologist (one who thought that nearly
all myths were symbolic stories about the rising and setting sun, light and dark
ness, and the seasons), and he had followers who were even more ardent than he,
if less learned. The indiscriminate aligning of narrative elements to natural phe
nomena led to the eventual discrediting of comparative mythology, not least
when Andrew Lang, a critic of Max Müller, demonstrated that Müller himself
was a solar myth.
The discrediting of nature mythology coincided with the growth of anthro
pology based on field observation in a single culture, and the result was the
Introduction 31



demise of comparative mythology in the early part of the twentieth century. But
Georges Dumézil, the great comparativist, began his academic career at the
same time, trained by the Indo-European linguist Antoine Meillet but influenced
by the sociologists Marcel Mauss and Émile Durkheim. Dumézil, unlike most
of his linguistically trained predecessors, compared structure, not etymology,
and he was quite prepared to argue that two deities in different Indo-European
traditions were equivalent even when they had no etymological relationship
whatever. Nor was he the least bit interested in potential reflection of the phe
nomena of nature. Rather, he thought that three social “functions” were repre
sented in the mythologies of the various Indo-European peoples. The first
function was that of sovereignty, which, according to Dumézil, is ordinarily rep
resented by two deities, each of whom is associated with one or the other side of
sovereignty: either with the awe inspired by a leader or with the legal, contrac
tual nature that a sovereign was obligated to uphold. The classic split was found
in the Vedic god Varuna and the Persian god Mithra; in Norse mythology,
Dumézil argued, Odin represented the awesome side and Ty ́r the legal or con
tractual side of sovereignty. The second function was might or force, and in
Norse mythology Thor fulfilled that function. The third function was fertility,
and here the deities are often doubled, as are Frey and Freyja. At one time
Dumézil thought these functions represented actual social classes in proto-Indo
European society, but later he backed away from this notion and was content to
argue for the structure on a purely mythological plane.
A second aspect of the Dumézilian theory involved the “displacement of
myth,” that is, the idea that a mythic structure could be “displaced” to the level
of divine heroes or in some cases historical fictions. In the Scandinavian area,
Dumézil’s most forceful argument for such displacement involved the prehis
toric king Hadingus, who had many aspects, according to Dumézil, but who also
enacted in his life and career all three functions.
Until the late 1950s or early 1960s Dumézil was little known outside
France, but thereafter scholars in many fields began to acquaint themselves with
his huge output of scholarly writings, and translations of his work began to
appear. It was probably inevitable that with such an ambitious project covering
so much territory, there would errors at the most specialized level, and in Norse
mythology, as in other areas, part of the initial reaction was to point these out.
Other critics noted that a tripartite division of the sort Dumézil proposed was
relatively common and therefore might have little explanatory power. In
medieval Christian Europe, for example, the theory of society involved a divi
sion into priest, warriors, and laborers, and that could hardly be an Indo-Euro
pean inheritance. Even so, the Dumézilian apparatus is by now so widespread
that every student of an Indo-European mythology must be aware of it.
32 Norse Mythology



Dumézil was not the only person in the twentieth century to seek the Indo
European background of the mythology of one of the daughter traditions, and
many contributions have been made outside his theoretical focus. In Norse
mythology, study of Thor has especially profited from a look at such figures as
the Vedic god Indra and Baltic thunder gods.
CULT, WORSHIP, AND SACRIFICE
This is a book about myths (narratives), not religion (here defined as ritual prac
tice), and as I explained above, few of the narratives were composed during the
pagan period and virtually none was recorded then. This makes any study of the
cult and ritual that Norse mythology might have accompanied a tricky matter
indeed. Nevertheless, we do have some information.
Discussions of the ritual practices associated with Norse mythology usually
begin with descriptions by Roman writers of the Germanic peoples, and this is
justifiable because the gods we know from our mythological texts also left traces
in such forms as the names of the days of the week (see the entry Interpretatio
Germanica in chapter 3).
The foremost witness is the Germania of Tacitus, from the last years of the
first century C.E. Tacitus describes several ritual acts carried out by various Ger
manic tribes, of which the most famous is surely the worship of the goddess
Nerthus described in chapter 40 of his Germania. Nerthus, Mother Earth, cov
ered by a cloth, is transported in a cart drawn by cows and accompanied by a
priest who recognizes when she is present. This procession takes place in a holy
grove on the island on which she lives, and all weapons are laid aside on the days
on which it takes place, which are ones of peace and quiet. After the procession,
everything is washed in the ocean by slaves who are then drowned.
A number of the aspects of this ceremony agree with what scholars think
they know about cult and ritual of the Germanic peoples. Tacitus says else
where—and other sources, including place-names, agree—that worship occurs in
a sacred grove. The killing of the slaves might also be regarded as a form of sac
rifice, a subject to which I will return shortly. Other aspects of the worship of
Nerthus find striking agreement with texts recorded much later that are associ
ated specifically with the vanir. Freyja’s cart is pulled by cats, and according to
Ögmundar tháttr dytts, admittedly a late text, (an idol of) Frey is pulled about
in a cart accompanied by an attendant, female in this case. Fródi, who shares
many characteristics with Frey, was also pulled in a cart, and a time of great
peace and prosperity was associated with both Frey and Fródi.
Although there does not seem to have been a separate priestly class, the
Introduction 33



term goƒi, as suggested above, implies a religious function for the leaders of Ice
landic society before the conversion to Christianity. As a Roman, Tacitus used the
vocabulary of his own era and therefore called the man who accompanied Nerthus
a “priest,” but he could easily have been something like a goƒi, a person of status
and a secular leader on the days when the goddess was not present. It is the “goƒi”
who notices when the goddess is present, and unlike the slaves, he survives to
preside over the ceremonies another day. Most or all cults must have been of this
nature, led by the chieftain when public ritual was enacted and by the head of
household in the case of private ritual. Many historians of religion have argued for
a close connection between law, society, and religion, and this connection would
be embodied in the men who presided over secular and sacred affairs.
Although Tacitus says the Germanic peoples worshipped in the open, the
notion of pagan temples is common in many of the later sources. This probably
marks both a change in paganism, perhaps as building techniques changed, and
the influence of Christian (and also pagan Roman) worship. In the northern
reaches of Scandinavia, the Sámi people seem to have retained an open-air priest
less paganism, and they were far from such influences. The eddic poems have
references to the building of places of worship (e.g., the “high-timbered” altar
and temple of Völuspá, stanza 7), and there is one very explicit description of a
pagan temple in Eyrbyggja saga, which shows, if nothing else, where a thir
teenth-century Icelander thought his pagan ancestors had worshipped three cen
turies earlier. Adam of Bremen’s account of the pagan temple at Uppsala,
mentioned above, is difficult to discount, but it must be remembered that the
end of the eleventh century, when Adam was writing, was a time of enormous
Christian influence in Sweden, and it is quite conceivable that the notion of a
building reserved for religious purposes could have resulted from such influence.
Scandinavian pagans had probably much earlier come in out of the rain for their
religious ceremonies: Scholars now agree that large homesteads were the sites of
cult activities as well as of other social activities.
The sources mention something called a hörgr, which I have translated “altar”
in this book. The eddic poems suggest the hörgr was something that could be red
dened, and they make it appear to be some sort of altar, at least in the sense that
sacrifices were made upon it. Etymologically the word seems to have to do with
stones or rocks, and it is not difficult to imagine the Germanic hörgr as a pile of
rocks in a sacred grove; the Old High German cognate is in fact sometimes found
with the meaning “sacred rock” and sometimes with the meaning “sacred grove.”
Tacitus says the Germanic peoples did not produce images of their gods.
Adam of Bremen says the pagan temple at Uppsala had idols of Thor, Wodan
(Odin), and Fricco (Frey). Again, the difference lies in the millennium that passed
between the times the two authors wrote, and probably also to some extent in
34 Norse Mythology



the influence of other models. Certainly medieval Scandinavians believed that
their pagan forebears had worshipped idols, for they routinely put idols in their
historical writings. In the Sagas of Icelanders, the expression “the gods” almost
always refers to idols, and when Icelanders translated the lives of the Christian
saints, they sometimes attached the names of their own pagan gods to the idols
worshipped by the pagans whom the early saints encountered.
The word used for pagan cult activity is blót. The etymology is disputed,
and that is a pity, for if we could recover the original meaning of the word we
would at least know something of the origin and perhaps nature of the activity
among the Germanic or pre-Germanic peoples. The two credible suggestions are
that blót is related to Latin flamen, “priest of a specific deity,” from a root mean
ing ultimately something like “sacrificial activity,” or to a root meaning “to
make strong,” ultimately deriving from a root meaning “swollen.” The first has
the advantage of being associated with religious activity, but it does not tell us
much about the actual conception. Far more important are the loans of blót into
Finnish, namely luote, “magic charm,” and Sámi luotte, “magic song.” These
show us the importance of verbal activity at a blót, specifically verbal activity
aimed at producing a result, presumably by means of intervention by the deities.
Another way to influence the deities was of course to make sacrifices to
them, and here we have an ample record to draw on. Bogs, wells, lakes, and the
earth have yielded such objects as broken weapons, which can only be inter
preted as gifts to the gods after battle. Classical sources report that the Germanic
peoples killed their defeated enemies rather than take them prisoner, again as a
form of sacrifice, and Adam of Bremen says that every ninth year at the pagan
temple at Uppsala, sacrifices of all kinds of creatures took place, including
humans. But the most important sacrifices at the blót were surely animals that
were slaughtered and eaten, presumably in some form of honor of a god.
In chapter 8 of his Ynglinga saga, Snorri Sturluson says that Odin estab
lished the succession of blót ceremonies in the north. Toward winter (i.e., in fall)
there should be a blót for prosperity; at midwinter, one for the growth of the soil;
and at summer, a third one, the victory-blót. There is an evident connection
here, as one would expect, with the rhythm of the year: The fall ceremony would
occur after the last harvest was in, and the animals slaughtered would be those
that were not to survive the winter. Some of their meat could be eaten fresh at
the blót, but much would be preserved for winter. The midwinter blót would
occur after the longest nights had passed and would celebrate the rebirth of the
earth; and the summer ceremony, if it was for victory, would coincide with the
departure of ships on raiding (and, more mundanely, trading) voyages.
Later in his Heimskringla, in Hákonar saga góda (The Saga of Hákon the
Good), Snorri gives an elaborate description of a blót that shows just how perva
Introduction 35



sive the influence of Christian liturgy was on the view of late Nordic paganism
of Snorri and other Icelandic intellectuals. The word hlaut is cognate with
English “lot,” as in “to cast lots.” I cannot find a reasonable translation, so I have
left it in the original.
It was the ancient custom, when a blót was to be held, that all farmers should
come to where the temple was, and to transport there the supplies they would
need as long as the banquet lasted. At the banquet everyone was to drink beer.
All sorts of cattle and horses were killed there, and all the blood that came from
them was called hlaut, and the vessels in which it stood hlaut-bowls, and the
hlaut-twigs were made like an aspergillum [a brush used to sprinkle holy water
in Catholic liturgy]. With it one was to redden the pedestal together with the
walls of the temple inside and out and also to sprinkle it on the people, while
the meat of the slaughtered animals was to be cooked for people to enjoy. . . . A
tankard was to be carried to the fire, and the one who made the banquet and was
the chieftain should bless the tankard and all the sacrificial meat and should
first toast Odin—that should be drunk for victory and for the kingdom of his
king—and after that a toast to Njörd and Frey for peace and prosperity. Then
people were eager to drink the bragafull [chieftain’s toast] next. People also
drank a toast to their kinsmen who had been buried in mounds; that was called
minni [memorial].
Take away the references to the gods and the blood spattered all about, and
one might well have a picture of a wealthy man’s feast in medieval Norway or
Iceland.
THE IMPORTANCE OF SCANDINAVIAN MYTHOLOGY
Although worship of the Scandinavian gods ended a thousand years ago, and the
myths are now exotic and foreign to most people in the English-speaking world,
we make implicit reference to the gods and myths almost every day of our lives.
That is because the names of the weekdays Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
Friday all contain the names of old Scandinavian gods (Ty ́r, Odin, Thor, and
Frigg; the Old English forms were Tiw, Wodæn, Thunor, and Friija), and the
choice of the gods for each of these days was based on myths about them. (I treat
the subject at greater length in the entry on Interpretatio Germanica in chapter
3.) Furthermore, when we read about or travel in places like Odense, Denmark
(probably best known outside Denmark as the birthplace of Hans Christian
Andersen), we see a place-name that once bore the name of the god Odin. There
are hundreds of these in Scandinavia, but they are seldom obvious, except in Ice
36 Norse Mythology



land, where there are places with names like ∏órsmörk (Thor’s forest), a favorite
place for hiking and camping. And if you are acquainted with or have heard of
anyone called Freyja, Thor, Baldur (a not uncommon name in Iceland), or any
Scandinavian name beginning with Tor, you know of the persistence of the
names of the gods in personal naming systems.
The era when Norse mythology was most known in more recent times was
the Romantic period, when the gods and myths were a popular source of inspi
ration. Paul Henri Mallet’s Introduction à l’histoire de Dannemarc, ou l’on
traite de la religion, des loix, des moeurs, et des usages des anciens danois
(Copenhagen: Berling, 1755) made Norse mythology widely known for the first
time in a world language, and the work was translated into English in 1770 as
Northern Antiquities: Or, A Description of The Manners, Customs, Religion,
and Laws of The Ancient Danes, and Other Northern Nations; Including Those
of Our Own Saxon Ancestors. With a Translation of The Edda, Or System of
Runic Mythology, and Other Pieces, from The Ancient Icelandic Tongue (Lon
don: T. Carnan and Co., 1770). The translator was Bishop Percy, who is famous
for his Reliques of Ancient Poetry, a collection of ballads and other pieces that
was one of the most influential works of English Romanticism. The second vol
ume of Mallet contained a translation of the mythological stories of Snorri’s
Edda, in a late arrangement done by Magnús Ólafsson, parson at Laufás in the
early seventeenth century and therefore known as the Laufás Edda. It was at the
end of the eighteenth century, too, that translations of eddic poetry began to
appear in the European languages. During the late eighteenth and early nine
teenth centuries Norse mythology was the vogue, especially in Germany and
Scandinavia, and many of the famous Romantic poets reworked stories from
Norse mythology into drama or verse. Romantic painters also found inspiration
in the Norse myths.
In a way the ultimate result of this Romantic interest in Norse myth and
heroic legend was the opera cycle by the German composer Richard Wagner en
titled Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung). This mighty work,
originally intended to be heard over the course of just three days, consists of a
prologue called Das Rheingold (The Rhine-gold), followed by three hefty three
act operas, Die Walküre (The Valkyrie), Siegfried, and Götterdämmerung (Twi
light of the Gods). Wagner wrote the book as well as the music, using a kind of
alliterative, archaic German that has its own strange charm, at least when sung.
He based his story loosely on the so-called Burgundian cycle, that is, the heroic
poems of the Poetic Edda centering on Sigurd, Völsunga saga, and the medieval
German epic Das Nibelungenlied (The Song of the Nibelungs). The major action
of the first part of the cycle Wagner took from the story that prefaces Reginsmál
in the Poetic Edda, involving a cursed ring that the gods obtain and must give
Introduction 37



up. Although many of the gods make only small appearances, Odin, called either
Wotan (the German form of his name) or the Wanderer, plays an absolutely piv
otal role. He leaves the stage at the end of the second act of Die Walküre, but
Walhalla, the abode of the gods, is seen crumbling at the end of Götterdäm
merung as the Rhine overflows its banks and cleanses the world of the cursed
ring. It is powerful music and powerful theater.
Wagner was one of Hitler’s favorite composers, and Norse mythology had a
sad revival in connection with Nazi ideology. Today Norse mythology every
once in a while is found in connection with contemptible neo-Nazi activities,
but for the most part it is the stuff of either comic books or fantasy literature.
There was a revival of “belief in the æsir” some years ago in Iceland, which
seemed to have to do at least in part with tax breaks for organized religion,
although partying is also important. That revival had its counterpart in Norway,
where a group of students announced themselves to be believers in the æsir. In
celebration, they drank some beer and sacrificed a sausage.

THE NATURE OF MYTHIC TIME
R
eligions of the world experience and encode time in various ways: as a lin
ear progression, as a never-ending set of cycles, as a process of degenera
tion, and so forth. We are most used to a linear system, since it
characterizes our Judeo-Christian tradition, which sees a clear progression from
the creation of the world through a long present leading to a last time, a day of
judgment, an end of history. Similarly, our science gives us increasing detail
concerning the origin of the entire universe. We live in the long aftermath of the
big boom and the origin of our solar system, and we know that in due course our
sun will die. In a cyclical system, however, such a linear progression repeats
itself endlessly; each end is followed by a new beginning. Determining the time
system of Scandinavian mythology presents special challenges because many of
the sources were recorded by Christians, whose notion of time was linear and
whose notion of history called for an essentially clear chronology. This is espe
cially so of Snorri Sturluson, whose Edda is the clearest and most appealing
account of the mythology to modern readers. It must not be forgotten that Snorri
was also a historian, the author or compiler of a history of the Norwegian kings
(Heimskringla) arranged wholly chronologically. The other great overview of the
mythology is the eddic poem Völuspá. Although nearly all scholars agree that it
dates from the pagan period, most would assign it to late paganism, and Christ
ian influence seems apparent. Even so, Völuspá seems to show traces of a cyclic
arrangement of time as well as a linear arrangement.
Furthermore, the various myths present direct contradictions of relative
chronology. Such contradiction is, however, characteristic of myth, which has
its own rules. Within Scandinavian mythology, these rules appear to suggest a
fairly consistent ordering of events within a given narrative, but no requirement
whatever that events within the mythology as a whole can be fit into a precise
order. Examples will be cited below, but anyone who confronts the primary
sources or even a summary of the mythology will easily identify others.
39



MYTHIC PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE
The mythology as a whole may be divided into events that take place in the past,
present, and future, an idea that is expressed in the meanings of the names of the
norns Urd, “Became” or “Happened”; Verdandi, “Becoming” or “Happening”;
and Skuld, “Is-to-be” or “Will-happen.” However, it is convenient to make fur
ther distinctions.
The distant past would involve the period before the creation of the uni
verse. At that time there was only Ginnunga gap, the vast void of potency and
potential, and perhaps also the Élivágar, mysterious waters from which life was
to emerge. We must assign Ymir to this distant past, and also his hermaphroditic
generation of the races of giants. Similarly, Bur, the first of the gods, existed at
this time.
The focus of the near past would be the creation of the cosmos, from the
body of Ymir according to most sources. The precondition for forming the cos
mos was the killing of Ymir by the sons of Bur, so we may say that the move
ment from the distant past to the near past encompasses a move from a stasis
between the two major groups of gods to a state of enmity. During this near past
the gods also enabled the reckoning of time by assigning stations to the heavenly
bodies (Völuspá, stanza 5), and they similarly enabled culture by creating tools
(Völuspá, stanza 7). They created the races of dwarfs and humans. Finally, I
would assign the incorporation of the vanir and of Loki into the æsir as the final
events of the near past.
With the completion of these incorporations, the mythological world looks
as it does in most of the myths. Snorri’s catalog of the gods in Gylfaginning
includes the vanir and Loki, and also Baldr, whose death is yet to come. I would
call this state the mythological present, the time when most of the myths take
place. Although it hardly matters whether a given myth of the mythological pres
ent occurs before or after some other myth, certain events do seem to have to pre
cede or follow others. For example, when in Skáldskaparmál of Snorri’s Edda the
gods wish to appease Skadi for the killing of her father Thjazi, they offer her a
choice of husband among the gods, letting her select based on an observation of
just their lower legs. She chooses what she thinks are Baldr’s but ends up with old
Njörd. According to the reasoning of this narrative, then, Njörd’s marriage to
Skadi preceded the death of Baldr. However, Frey’s marriage to Gerd appears to
have followed Baldr’s death. In Skírnismál, stanza 21, Skírnir offers the giantess
Gerd “the ring which was burned with the young son of Odin,” and this can only
be Draupnir. If it was burned with the son of Odin, Baldr must already be dead,
and Frey and Gerd’s marriage has yet even to be arranged, much less consum
mated after the nine nights that must intervene after the arrangement is made. I
40 Norse Mythology



think Snorri must have had this sequence of events in mind when he wrote
Gylfaginning, for in the catalog of gods he says that Njörd is married to Skadi, but
he does not say that Frey is married to Gerd. And following this chronology, we
might assume that Baldr was, in Snorri’s mind, already dead when the gods vis
ited Ægir at the very beginning of Skáldskaparmál, for he includes Gerd in the
guest list. However, we must take care with such assumptions. In the case of this
guest list, for example, Baldr is indeed absent, but Nanna is present. Either she
did not after all cast herself on Baldr’s funeral pyre, as Snorri says she did in
Gylfaginning, or the chronology will not hold. Such inconsistencies are, let me
stress, not causes for worry. They are in the nature of mythology.
Similarly, we may think of events as occurring relatively early or relatively
late in the mythological present. An example of a relatively early event would
be the acquisition of the mead of poetry. The mead was in the first place created
as a result of the conclusion of hostilities between æsir and vanir and is a token
of the incorporation of the two groups. It is one of Odin’s most powerful
weapons in the ongoing struggle with the jötnar. Similarly, the construction of
the wall around the stronghold of the gods, told most fully in Snorri’s Gylfagin
ning, is a story of the early mythological present. It explains not only how a wall
gets built around Valhöll (which is mentioned in several myths, e.g., Odin’s
interaction with Hrungnir and Loki’s rescue of Idun), but also how Sleipnir,
Odin’s eight-legged horse, is created. Here again, strict chronological consis
tency is lacking, for the account of the acquisition of the mead of poetry in
Skáldskaparmál implies the existence of the wall (the gods put the kettles for it
in the enclosure), but the incorporation of the æsir and vanir, which is the pre
condition for the mead, occurred in the near past. Another story of the early
mythological present would be Odin’s sending of Hel to the underworld and the
Midgard serpent to the outer waters of the ocean, as well as the binding of the
wolf Fenrir, when Ty ́r lost his hand. In the mythological present Hel presides
over the underworld, Thor fishes up the Midgard serpent in offshore waters, and
Ty ́r is without his hand, while Fenrir awaits the end of the world.
Odin’s myths tend toward the early part of the mythic present: Already
mentioned are the mead of poetry, war and peace with the vanir, oath of blood
brotherhood with Loki, and disposition of Loki’s children. In addition there is
Odin’s self-sacrifice, which gained him much of the rest of the wisdom he uses
in the mythological present. Odin myths in the mythological present would
include in particular the stories of his visits with the giant Vafthrúdnir and the
human king Geirröd, in each of which wisdom plays an important role.
Nearly all of the Thor myths take place in the undifferentiated mythic pres
ent. These include, besides his fishing up of the Midgard serpent, his encounters
with Hrungnir, Hymir, and Geirröd.
Time 41



Some events must be fairly late in the mythological present, and the fore
most of these is the death of Baldr. As the first death among the gods, it changed
all the terms of the game. Even if it did not make Ragnarök inevitable, it made
it possible, for now the death of any and therefore of all the gods is a possibility.
If we follow the Baldr story in Snorri’s Gylfaginning, we see that Odin’s strategy
of swearing blood-brotherhood with Loki has failed, for it was Loki who brought
about Baldr’s death. The gods now bind Loki, and like his sons the wolf Fenrir
and the Midgard serpent, he awaits Ragnarök, the end of the world and the final
period in the mythology. Many of the events in the mythic present look forward
to Ragnarök: the failed oath of blood-brotherhood, the binding of evil creatures,
and the gathering of einherjar, the chosen warriors of Odin, at Valhöll.
The mythic future also has two stages. In the near future is Ragnarök, when
the power of the gods over the jötnar characteristic of the mythic present will be
reversed. Surt will lead the forces of chaos against the gods, who will fall. The
creative activities of the near past will be undone: Time reckoning will fail as
the sun and moon are swallowed and the heavens destroyed, and the entire cos
mos will be consumed by flames and water. Each of the major gods will die in
individual combat with a giant adversary, but Odin, at least, will be avenged, by
his son Vídar, the silent god, and this vengeance constitutes a bridge to the dis
tant future, the period after Ragnarök when the second-generation gods Vídar
and Váli, Magni and Módi, and, perhaps most important, Baldr and Höd, victim
and killer, will inhabit the renewed earth. They will possess the cultural prop
erty of their ancestors in the form of oral traditions about them as well as in the
concrete form of the gaming pieces Völuspá, stanza 61, says they will find in the
grass. This paradise will be fertile and devoid of jötnar.
As I have thus outlined it, the overall chronology of Scandinavian mythol
ogy is neatly symmetrical. The early present looks back to the near past, just as
the later present looks forward directly to the near future. The creative work of
the near past is undone in the near future, but the vicious relationship between
gods and jötnar, which enabled the creation of the cosmos and led to its destruc
tion, is gone in the distant future, just as it was not present in the distant past.
But there has still been a progression: In the distant past there was no cosmos,
but in the distant future there is a green world with birds and fertile fields. The
course of the mythology has indeed led to a better world.
CYCLICAL TIME
Völuspá, stanza 4, states that the creating gods lifted up the earth, and the poem
is silent on the killing of Ymir. These facts could imply that when the earth
42 Norse Mythology



arose from the sea after Ragnarök later in the poem, there was a cyclical notion
at work. In other words, the cosmos might be formed and reformed on multiple
occasions by rising from the sea. This notion, which accords with the theories
of Mircea Eliade as expressed, for example, in his The Myth of the Eternal
Return, has been expressed most clearly by Jens Peter Schjødt in his 1981 article
“Völuspá—cyklisk tidsopfattelse i gammelnordisk religion” (Danske studier 76
[1981]: 91–95). Schjødt points especially to the last stanza of Völuspá, which
refers to the arrival of a dragon and the sinking of the sibyl. In the best treatment
of time in Norse mythology, that of Margaret Clunies Ross in volume 1 of her
Prolonged Echoes, especially chapter 7, Clunies Ross accepts the possibility of
underlying traces of cyclic time but offers a linear progression very similar to the
one I have outlined here, the differences being that I split the mythic present
into periods of early, undifferentiated, and late, and also that I demonstrate the
symmetries of the chronology and their implications.
TIME AND SPACE
Clunies Ross also discusses the relationship between time and space that char
acterized the structural analyses of Eleazar Meletinskij, “Scandinavian Mythol
ogy as a System,” The Journal of Structural Anthropology 1 (1973): 43–58, and 2
(1974): 57–78, and Kirsten Hastrup, Culture and History in Medieval Iceland:
An Anthropological Assessment of Structure and Change (Oxford: Clarendon,
1985). Both these authors sought to distinguish the vertical from the horizontal
axes, the first manifesting itself in the world tree linking heaven and the under
world, and the second, in the disk of the earth on which Ásgard, Midgard, and
the worlds of the giants are located. Meletinskij argued that cosmogony and
eschatology were distinguished by the axes and that this distinction had a
chronological aspect. Hastrup described the difference as one of reversibility:
Events on the vertical axis were “irreversible,” for they were fated; those on the
horizontal axis were “reversible,” in that the balance between gods and giants
was so close. Both Clunies Ross and Jens Peter Schjødt, “Horizontale und ver
tikale Achsen in der vorchristlichen skandinavischen Kosmologie,” in Old
Norse and Finnish Cultic Religions and Place Names, ed. Tore Ahlbäck, Scripta
Instituti Donneri Aboensis, 13 (Åbo, Finland: Donner Institute for Research in
Religious and Cultural History, 1990), 35–57, disagreed. Schjødt takes on the
notion of the “eschatological” or “irreversible” nature of the vertical axis and
argues that it has cyclical aspects. Clunies Ross argues that events on the hori
zontal axis (those that for the most part fall into the mythic present) are hardly
reversible even in Hastrup’s model, for they contribute directly to eschatology
Time 43



(put another way: the mythic present always looks back to the past and forward
to the future).
MYTH, NARRATIVE, AND LANGUAGE
The situation is further complicated by two other factors. The first is the
“immanence” of the mythology: The entire system is implicit in any of its
details, and a myth is equally present in a kenning or an allusive skaldic poem
from the pagan period, and neither of these requires any kind of chronology but,
instead, implies a kind of simultaneity of myth. The second is a linguistic after
effect and may be presented here by discussing stanza 28 of Lokasenna. Frigg has
just admonished Loki.
You know, if here I had in Ægir’s hall
A son like Baldr
Away you would never get from the sons of the æsir,
And you would be struck down in anger.
Loki’s response is a boast about his role in the slaying of Baldr. The second
half of stanza 28 goes literally as follows.
I arrange it, that you never see
Baldr afterwards ride up to the hall anymore.
Most translators render the first three words as something like “I am respon
sible,” and indeed the present tense of the verb might be understood that way.
Conceivably it might also be read literally as a progressive: “I am arranging,”
that is, I’m taking care of that right now. But in medieval Icelandic the simple
present tense also is used for the future, so Loki may be saying “I will arrange
it.” And although the word is quite clear in the one manuscript retaining the
poem, the difference between present and past tense is just the vowel, and some
editors have chosen to print the past tense rather than the present tense. In other
words, when Loki was insulting all the gods, he had killed Baldr, was planning
it, or would take care of it later.
The same linguistic fact complicates our understanding of other texts. In
Völuspá, for example, the seeress who speaks the poem says in one manuscript
that she saw various events connected with Ragnarök (in the other she says she
uses the present tense, as one would expect of a vision of the mythic future, as
the frame of the poem implies). But around stanza 44 she begins to use the pres
ent tense. Is she situated toward the onset of Ragnarök?
44 Norse Mythology



MYTH AND HISTORY
For the Christians of the Scandinavian Middle Ages, the gods would have had a
place in historical time both through their euhemerization and through their
presence in some of the lives of the saints translated from Latin into Icelandic.
According to the notion of the euhemerization that prevailed in medieval Iceland,
the gods were originally human beings who had emigrated from the Middle East
(Tyrkland) to Scandinavia long ago. They would have left their homeland at some
point during the Roman Empire, which can be reckoned to around 100 B.C.E. Both
Snorri Sturluson and Saxo Grammaticus associate the legendary king Fródi,
grandson of Frey according to Snorri, with the peace that occurred when Christ
was on earth. And the translated lives of the saints put the Norse gods (in place
of Jupiter, Mars, Diana, and other Roman gods) in the time and space of early
Christianity—even if they are only for the most part envisioned in these texts as
idols animated by demons.
It is furthermore possible—perhaps likely—that Ragnarök was seen by at
least some Christians as the demise not only of the pagan gods but of the belief
in and worship of them. Their day would have preceded that of Christ, and it had
a fiery and perhaps well-deserved end. Certainly the famous stanza 65H of
Völuspá, found in the late-fourteenth-century redaction of the text, supports
such a possibility, for it mentions the coming to power of “the powerful one,
from on high, he who rules all.” Whoever created this verse appears to have con
sidered the world he and his fellow Christians lived in to be the new world that
followed Ragnarök. The conversion to Christianity seems to have been envi
sioned while it was happening as a struggle between Thor and Christ. Thor and
his fellow gods thus exited history at about the time Christ entered it in the
north, that is, in the tenth and eleventh centuries.

DEITIES, THEMES, AND CONCEPTS
ÆGIR
The sea personified; a famous host to the gods but listed among the jötnar.
The name appears to be identical to a noun for “sea” in skaldic poetry, and that
noun, or the name of the figure under discussion here, is the base word in many
kennings. For example, “Ægir’s horse” is a ship, and “daughters of Ægir” are
waves. In Skáldskaparmál, Snorri says that Rán is the wife of Ægir and that they
have nine daughters, most of whom bear names meaning “wave.” Since Rán is
listed among the goddesses in the thulur and Ægir has a peaceful relationship
with the gods, his inclusion in the thulur as a giant seems questionable.
The eddic poems often show Ægir as host to the gods. Hymiskvida is set in
motion because the gods expect to visit Ægir and will need a huge cauldron in
which to brew the beer that will be consumed. The poem tells how Thor
acquires the cauldron from the giant Hymir. The next poem in Codex Regius of
the Poetic Edda is Lokasenna, Loki’s flyting (that is, verbal duel) with the gods,
and it is set at a feast hosted by Ægir. Indeed, paper manuscripts call the poem
Ægisdrekka (Ægir’s Drinking Party). According to the prose header to the poem,
“Ægir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared beer for the æsir.” After enu
merating the guest list (most of the æsir except Thor, who was away to the east
bashing trolls), the author reports that bright gold was used there in place of fire
light, and the beer served itself. It was a great place of sanctuary, but Loki kills
Ægir’s servant Fimafeng, and Eldir, Ægir’s other servant, is the first with whom
Loki exchanges words in the series of flytings that make up the poem. Loki’s last
words are reserved for Ægir:
You made the beer, Ægir, and you never more will
Have a feast again;
All your possessions, which are here inside,
May fire play over,
And may it burn your back.
47



Ægir’s prowess as a host is the final motif Odin reveals to the terrified King
Geirröd in Grímnismál before beginning the list of names that leads to his
epiphany. But Ægir was also a famous guest, according to Snorri. The frame story
that he uses in the first sections of Skáldskaparmál begins with this introduc
tion of Ægir:
A man was named Ægir or Hlér; he lived on that island which is now called
Hlér’s Island [modern Læssø in Denmark]. He had much magic knowledge. He
made his way to Ásgard, but the æsir knew of his journey in advance. He was
well received, but many things were done with illusions.
The similarities to Gylfaginning are remarkable, and they are only extended
when Bragi, who is seated next to Ægir, begins to tell Ægir stories: the mythic
narratives in Skáldskaparmál, beginning with the Thjazi-Idun-Skadi complex.
Ægir asks questions after hearing this cycle, and more myths follow. The dia
logue between Ægir the questioner and Bragi the narrator continues for many
pages in Skáldskaparmál and is embedded in many of the myths that are
recounted. After a time, speakers are not identified, but the dialogue form is car
ried on throughout Skáldskaparmál, and Ægir reappears as the subject in one of
the questions concerning kennings: Why is gold called “fire of the sea” or “fire
of Ægir”? The answer is what was found in the prose header to Lokasenna: Gold
was used to light Ægir’s hall when he entertained the æsir.
The beginning of Orkneyinga saga (The Saga of the Orkney Islanders) is some
times called Fundinn Noregr (Norway Found), and it is closely related to a section
of Flateyjarbók called Hversu Noregr byggdisk (How Norway Was Settled). It
begins with a king called Fornjót, who ruled in northern Norway. “Fornjót had
three sons. One was named Hlér, whom we call Ægir, the second Logi, the third
Kári.” Like ægir, hlér is a noun meaning “sea.” The noun logi means “fire,” and
kári is listed among the thulur for “wind.” Thus Ægir as a personification of the
sea would appear to have been regarded as one of the three elements in a genealog
ical tradition that presumably was localized in Norway.

Magoun treated some place-names, including the name of Ægir, in “Fi feldor and the Name of the Eider,” Namn och bygd 28 (1940): 91–114.

included discussion of Rán and Ægir/Hlér. Margaret Clunies Ross, “Snorri Sturluson’s Use of the Norse Origin Legend of the Sons of Fornjótr in His Edda,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 98 (1983): 47–66, analyzes Snorri’s understanding of natural forces as giants.
ÆGIR’S DAUGHTERS
The waves of the sea; nine sisters, daughters of Ægir and Rán.
Ægir is the sea personified, and his daughters are the waves. The poet known
only as Svein, perhaps an Icelander of the eleventh century, describes a wintry
storm in which gusts of wind from the mountains riffle and tear apart Ægir’s
daughters, that is, the waves. Helgakvida Hundingsbana I, stanza 29, calls a
powerful wave that nearly overturns a ship Ægir’s daughter. In Skáldskaparmál,
Snorri Sturluson says that Rán is Ægir’s wife and the mother of Ægir’s daugh
ters. Snorri lists their names twice, with a variation in the eighth name only:
Himinglæfa (Transparent-on-top), Dúfa (Wave), Blódudhadda (Bloody-hair),
Hefring (Lifting), Unn (Wave), Hrönn (Wave), Bylgja (Billow), Kára (Powerful) or
Dröfn (Wave), and Kólga (Cool-wave). The only one of these names whose appro
priateness is not immediately apparent is “Bloody-hair,” which I take to refer to
reddish foam atop a wave.
See also Ægir
ÆSIR
The gods; also the main group of gods, as opposed to the vanir.
The medieval Icelandic word æsir is a plural; the singular is áss, and a derived
feminine form, ásynja (pl., ásynjur), means “goddess.” Etymologically, áss
appears to be derived from an Indo-European root meaning “breath,” and this
would suggest an association with life and life-giving forces. A dissenting ety
mology would understand the term as associated with sovereignty and “binding
gods,” parallel to the terms bönd and höpt. The term is found a few times in
early runic inscriptions, and the cognate is found in Old English os, “god, deity,”
and in anses, “demigods,” a Latinized version of a word in Gothic, the language
of the well-known Germanic tribe. The word áss, or its homonym, also means
“beam” or “post,” and some scholars seek an association with wooden idols or
the equivalent. The rune poems, which are relatively late, give áss or its equiv
alent as the name of the a-rune.
In medieval Icelandic the term æsir is the one most often found when the
gods are being described as a group, in prose and in poetry. In Thrymskvida, for
example, when it is revealed that Thor’s hammer has been stolen by the giant
Thrym and that he will exchange it only for Freyja, the poet writes:
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 49



Then all the æsir were at an assembly,
And all the ásynjur in discussion. (stanza 14)
Often the term álfar, “elves,” is used as a parallel, probably because of the
alliteration that the poetic form required, but also perhaps because of a funda
mental association between the two groups. As she describes the world crum
bling about them at Ragnarök, for example, the seeress of Völuspá asks: “What’s
with the æsir, / what’s with the elves?” (stanza 48), a formula that is repeated in
Thrymskvida, stanza 7. In the Ljódatal section of Hávamál, Odin boasts that he
can discern the difference between æsir and álfar (stanza 159) and adds that the
fifteenth song he has learned was chanted by the dwarf Thjódörir, before the
doors of Delling: “He chanted strength for the æsir, / advancement for the álfar,
/ and mind for Hroptaty ́r [Odin]” (stanza 160). The formulaic association of æsir
and álfar is also found in Grímnismál, Skírnismál, and Lokasenna.
Although the plural refers to all the gods, the singular seems to have a spe
cial association with Thor. Thus, when Thor tells Loki about the theft of the
hammer early in Thrymskvida, he says: “The áss has had his hammer stolen”
(stanza 2). Thor is called Ása-Thor (Thor of the æsir). No other god is described
in this way, and it has been suggested that this extension of the name means that
he was regarded as best of the æsir.
The most interesting use of the word æsir is that of Snorri Sturluson in the
euhemerization project he set forth in the preface to his Edda and in the open
ing chapters of Ynglinga saga. Ásía, the Old Norse word for Asia, appeared to
contain the word áss, although of course it does not, and Snorri used the sound
similarity to suggest that the original meaning of æsir was “men of Asia.” Chap
ter 2 of Ynglina saga begins as follows:
To the east of Tanakvísl [the river Don] in Asia was known as Ásaland [land of
the æsir] or Ása-heimr [world of the æsir], and the principle stronghold in the
land they called Ásgard.
Because of this usage, one must take care when reading Snorri’s Edda. When
King Gylfi resolves to set off for his encounter with High, Equally-high, and
Third, it is because he is curious about the knowledge and power of the Ása-folk,
which must refer to “Asians”; the intended euhemerism may even explain
Snorri’s choice of “Ása-folk,” which clearly retains the root of Ásía, here instead
of “æsir.” In the frame to Skáldskaparmál, however, he just refers to the inhab
itants of Ásgard as æsir, and there the ambiguity may be deliberate.

ÆSIR-VANIR WAR
War fought at the beginning of time, leading by its truce to the incorporation of the
æsir and vanir into a single unified group of gods.
We know the war from Völuspá and from Snorri’s somewhat varying descrip
tions in the Ynglinga saga of his Heimskringla and in the Skáldskaparmál of his
Edda. The sequence in Völuspá of stanzas 21–24 refers to the first battle in the
world, and in stanza 24 both the æsir and vanir are mentioned. The seeress is
speaking of herself in the third person:
21. She remembers the battle of armies, the first one in the world,
When Gullveig with spears they studded
And in the hall of Hár burned her;
Thrice burned, thrice born,
Often, unseldom, though she yet lives.
22. They called her Heid, where she came to [the?] houses,
a seeress very wise, she cast spells;
she performed seid where she could, she performed seid, in a trance,
she was ever the joy of an evil woman.
23. Then all the powers went to the judgment seats
the very holy gods, and discussed this:
whether the æsir should pay a fine,
or all the gods should have tribute.
24. That was yet the battle of armies, the first one in the world.
Odin let fly and shot into the army,
The shield wall of the fortress of the æsir was broken,
The battle-wise vanir knew how to tread the field.
I am uncertain about portions of the above translation, especially the second
half of stanza 23. In stanza 21 and stanza 24, the term I have translated as “army”
and “armies” is fólk, and although the word indeed means “army” in the older
poetry, by the Middle Ages it also commonly had the meaning “people.” Thus,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 51



it is quite possible that the scribes of the Poetic Edda and a thirteenth-century
audience could have understood the stanza as referring literally to a battle of
peoples.
Although these stanzas are anything but clear, they seem to tell of a bat
tle precipitated by the entry of Gullveig or Heid among the æsir. They were
unable to kill her with spears or fire, and she was a practitioner of seid, the
ancient form of divination and of magic in general. Since Snorri says that
Freyja brought seid to the æsir, many scholars have assumed that
Gullveig/Heid is actually Freyja, one of the vanir, and that her corruption of
the æsir precipitated the war. Gullveig appears to mean “Gold-drink” or pos
sibly “Gold-intoxication”; Heid means perhaps “Shiny.” Stanza 23 seems to
have to do with an inability to reach a truce during a war, and understood thus
it leads nicely into the battle of stanza 24. The move, however, from “æsir” to
the inclusive “all the gods” could indicate a move toward a community
involving æsir and vanir.
When Snorri tells about the war in Skáldskaparmál, it is as part of the
much longer story of the origin of the mead of poetry, which Ægir has asked
Bragi about. The beginning of this story, Bragi responds, is that the gods had
been in conflict with that people (fólk) who were called the vanir, and they
negotiated a truce settlement in which each side spat into a kettle. From the
mingled spittle came Kvasir, and from him in turn came the mead of poetry, but
that is another story.
Snorri devotes more attention to the war and its aftermath in Ynglinga saga.
Here the story is set into the historical or pseudohistorical context of the æsir as
Asians and the vanir as a people dwelling by the river Tanakvísl, or, as Snorri
says it might be called in violation of every modern linguistic norm but in a per
fectly reasonable medieval linguistic jump, Vanakvísl. Snorri, in chapter 4,
describes what looks like a real war. The story is as follows:
Odin went to war against the vanir, but they defended themselves and their
land well, and neither side could gain the upper hand. They agreed on a settle
ment and exchanged hostages [here understood as men exchanged as pledges of
good faith]. The vanir sent their most distinguished men, Njörd and Frey, and
the æsir in exchange sent Hœnir, whom they declared to be a great leader, and
Mímir, who was very wise. In response, the vanir sent Kvasir, who was also very
wise. Hœnir proved to be unable of leadership without consulting Mímir, so the
vanir, suspecting that they had been cheated, beheaded Mímir and sent the head
to Odin. Odin preserved the head and it told him many hidden things. The æsir
made Njörd and Frey into leaders of cult. Freyja, Njörd’s daughter, first taught
seid to the æsir. Brother-sister incest, which had been common among the
vanir, was banned among the æsir.
52 Norse Mythology



Even if Freyja is not identical to Gullveig/Heid, the various versions seem
to share the notion of a disruptive entry of persons into a people (Gullveig/Heid
among the æsir, Hœnir and Mímir among the vanir) and the acquisition of tools
for the acquisition of wisdom, seid in two accounts and the head of Mímir in
one. Both of Snorri’s accounts place more emphasis on the settlement than on
the war, and from Skáldskaparmál we learn that the tangible symbol of the
truth, the mixed spittle, ultimately became one of the greatest tools for wisdom,
namely the mead of poetry. Ynglinga saga also indicates that the most distin
guished of the vanir, Njörd and Frey, were fully incorporated into the æsir.
Since the vanir are fertility deities, the war has often been understood as the
reflection of the overrunning of local fertility cults somewhere in the Germanic
area by a more warlike cult, perhaps that of invading Indo-Europeans. But
Georges Dumézil argued forcefully that the story of the war need be no more his
torical than any other myth: It is set before the emigration from the Middle East,
and it is far more focused on the truce than on the details of any battles. The
myth of the war between the æsir and vanir (perhaps better termed the “recon
ciliation of the æsir and vanir”?) explains symbolically how a religious system
contains various kinds of deities with varying functions.
See also Hœnir; Mead of Poetry; Mímir; Seid References and further reading: Dumézil published his ideas on the war in many places, but the easiest of access is found in chapter 1 of his Gods of the Ancient Northmen, ed. Einar Haugen, Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology, 3 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973). A social reading drawing on Indo-European parallels is Jarich G. Oosten, The War of the Gods: The Social Code in Indo-European Mythology (London: Routledge, 1985). Those wishing to see how the arguments were constructed for the notion of warring cults may consult Karl Weinhold, “Über den Mythus vom Wanenkrieg,”

haften zu Berlin, phil.-hist. Kl. 1890: 611–625, or H. W. Stubbs, “Troy, Ásgard, and Armageddon,” Folklore 70 (1959): 440–459. Torbjörg Östvold, “The War of the Æsir and the Vanir: A Myth of the Fall in Nordic Religion,” Temenos 5 (1969): 169–202, has not found favor.
ÁLFABLÓT
“Elf-sacrifice,” pagan ritual known from literary sources.
The Icelandic skald Sighvatr Thórdarson composed verses about his journey to
Västergötland, Sweden, circa 1017, gathered under the title Austrfararvísur.
Often the pagan Swedes refused hospitality, and in one verse this refusal is
explicitly linked to the álfablót that is going on inside. The verse says that it was
an old woman who denied entry, and that she was afraid of the wrath of Odin.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 53



This would appear to associate a cult of the elves explicitly with the gods. Kor
máks saga, chapter 22, has the prophetess Thórdís give advice to Thorvard, who
was wounded in a duel with Kormák and seeks to be healed. He must get a bull
slain by Kormák, pour its blood on a hill inhabited by elves, and prepare a feast
for them out of the slaughtered meat. Although the word álfablót is not used,
this too looks like a sacrifice to the elves. Certainly there is a vast difference
between a ceremony held indoors, as in the Swedish álfablót mentioned by
Sighvatr, and sacrificial acts undertaken in nature, as the thirteenth-century
Kormáks saga suggests for tenth-century Iceland, and this difference appears to
be greater than one would expect for regional variation. Since Sighvatr actually
uses the term álfablót, and is something of an eyewitness, we should probably
give his account precedence.
ÁLFHEIM (ELF-LAND)
Property of Frey, presumably a residence.
The information on Álfheim is found in the second half of stanza 5 of Grímnis
mál, which begins the list of residences of the gods:
Álfheim the gods in ancient times
Gave to Frey as a tooth-gift.
A tooth-gift was given when a child cut its first tooth, that is, when it was
around a year old. The notion of Frey as an infant among the æsir contradicts the
myth of the Æsir-Vanir War, in which Frey joined the æsir as a hostage (human
pledge) and at the time was a distinguished man.
Perhaps for this reason, in Gylfaginning Snorri has a different account of
Álfheim: It is, as the name suggests, the abode of the elves—or more precisely,
the light-elves; the dark-elves (only Snorri has this distinction) live below the
earth. No connection between Frey and the elves is known from other sources.
Álfheimar (plural) was also according to medieval historiography the name
of the geographic district between the mouths of the Göta and Glom (Norse
Raum) rivers in the coastal border districts between Sweden and Norway. The
Sögubrot af fornkonungum reports that the people who lived there were fairer
than others, which could indicate an association with the elves, but the name of
the district probably is derived from a word meaning a gravel layer under a field.
54 Norse Mythology



ALFÖDR (ALL-FATHER)
Odin name, found in skaldic and eddic poetry and frequent in the Gylfaginning in
Snorri’s Edda.
In Gylfaginning the very first question put by Gylfi/Gangleri is “Who is the fore
most or eldest of all the gods?” Hár answers, “That one is called Alfödr in our lan
guage, but in Old Ásgard he had twelve names.” The names listed are Odin names,
but Odin is not explicitly identified as Alfödr until later in Gylfaginning. Later
Snorri writes: “And he may be called Alfödr because he is the father of all the gods
and of men and of all that which was done by him and his power. The earth was his
daughter and his wife. From her he got his first son, Ása-Thor.” Although Snorri
seems to use Alfödr and Odin interchangeably (and some manuscripts have Alfödr
where others have Odin), it is not until he has formally introduced Odin as the first
in his catalog of æsir that the identification of Odin and Alfödr is made explicitly.
Odin is the foremost and eldest of the æsir; he rules all things, and as powerful as
the other gods are, they serve him as children do a father. . . . Odin is called Alfödr.
The form födr for “father” appears to be archaic. It is also found in the Odin
names Herfödr and Valfödr.
See also Odin
References and further reading: Walter Baetke discussed Snorri’s use of the name Alfödr in his Die Götterlehre der Snorra-Edda, Berichte über die Verhandlungen der sächischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig, phil.-hist. Kl., 97:3 (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1950). According to Baetke, the obvious Christian analogue to the concept of an all-father has to do with Snorri’s attempt to describe the natural religion of his pagan forebears, which Snorri assumes would have tended toward monotheism. Thus Odin, only one of many gods in the mythology itself, was in Baetke’s view promoted to a leading position in Snorri’s description of it.
ALMÁTTKI ÁSS
“All-powerful deity” of unknown identity.
The expression is found in oaths and is given its fullest expression in Land
námabók (in chapter 268 in the Hauksbók version). The passage describes the
paganism that obtained in Iceland in the early days of the settlement. Every
pagan temple should have a ring, and before entering into legal proceedings, each
man should swear an oath on that ring:
I attest that I make an oath on the ring, a legal oath: May Frey and Njörd and
the almáttki áss help me in this case as I prosecute or defend or bring wit
nesses or verdicts or judgments, as I know how to do most rightly or truly or
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 55



procedurally correctly, and dispatch all legal pleadings which fall to me, while
I am at the assembly.
I cite the full passage to counteract the impression given by some modern
writers that the oath served for general purposes; the author of this recension of
Landnámabók states quite clearly that it is a legal oath.
No certainty as to the identity of the almáttki áss has been reached. An
interpretation based purely on the mythology would lead to Odin, the all-father
and most powerful of the æsir. A consideration of the role of Thor around the
time of the conversion to Christianity and his lengthened name Ása-Thor would
lead easily to him. A focus on the ring might lead to Ull, for in Atlakvida, stanza
30, Gudún reminds Atli that he has sworn oaths on the ring of Ull. And in his
Lexikon der germanischen Mythologie, Rudolf Simek even plays with the idea
of Ty ́r, which might be possible if one attempted a purely historical reading.
Because Frey and Njörd are vanir, the word áss in the formula appears to
point specifically away from the vanir. But we must be cautious, as the entire
passage in question is the product of a medieval Christian author who was
demonstrably far more interested in his ancestors’ Christian background than in
their pagan background. Perhaps he even meant the “almighty áss” to be a noble
pagan anticipation of the new religion that was to come.

ALVÍSSMÁL
Eddic poem, “The Words of All-wise.”
Found only in Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, the poem is situated between
Völundarkvida and Helgakvida Hundingsbana I, the first of the heroic poems in
the manuscript. Alvíssmál may be the last of the poems in the mythological sec
tion because it has a dwarf as a main character; Völundarkvida has an elf, and
the two together may therefore represent a transitional section from poems of
gods to poems of men.
Alvíssmál consists of 35 stanzas of dialogue in the meter usually used for dia
logue, ljóƒaháttr. In the first stanzas one of the speakers announces that he has
come for a bride, and when challenged about his identity says, “I am named Alvíss
[All-wise], / I live down under the earth, / I have my dwelling under a stone.” In
56 Norse Mythology



stanza 6 the other speaker, the father of the bride, identifies himself as Vingthór,
the son of Sídgrani; that is, Thor, the son of Odin. Thor will only give up the girl,
whose troth was, he says, given while he was away (stanza 4), if the dwarf will tell
him everything he wishes to know. What follows is a series of 13 questions. Each
of them begins with the formula “Tell me that, Alvíss, / —all the fates of men / I
expect that you know, dwarf.” The questions themselves concern vocabulary:
What is something called, by which Thor seems to desire a list of synonyms. In his
responses Alvíss provides these synonyms according to the races or groups of beings
in the mythology. The groups are not always quite the same, but humans, gods, and
giants are constants, and vanir (as opposed to the gods in general), elves, dwarfs, and
the dead occur frequently. Generally the everyday word is assigned to humans and
the other terms are from the poetic vocabulary. Frequently the words assigned to
the gods have an elegant feel, while those assigned to the giants feel heavy or
clumsy, although admittedly such feelings are to a certain extent subjective.
The categories Thor requests are as follows: earth, heaven, moon, sun,
clouds, wind, calm, sea, fire, wood, night, seed, and ale. These categories and the
order in which they appear can hardly be arbitrary. The first five are cosmic, and
they are presented in the order in which they appear in the creation story. Sea
and fire will destroy the cosmos at Ragnarök, wood could represent Yggdrasil,
the world tree, and beer, which comes from grain that grows out of seeds, is asso
ciated with Odin and wisdom. At the equivalent point in an Odinic wisdom con
test there would be an epiphany, as in Grímnismál or Vafthrúdnismál, leading
to the death of the one contending in wisdom with the god, and here something
similar happens: Night, the eleventh category, has ended. Thor has the last word,
and in his final half-stanza he uses the “magic” meter galdralag. “In one breast
/ I never saw / more ancient wisdom; / with great deceits / I declare you trapped:
/ you are “dayed out,” dwarf, / now the sun shines in the hall.” We surmise that
the ray of sunlight shatters the dwarf or turns him to stone, as in many dwarf
legends; a giantess is turned to stone under precisely the same circumstances in
a heroic eddic peom, Helgakvida Hjörvardssonar.
Neither Thor nor dwarfs are ordinarily known for skill at verbal dueling, and
despite tantalizing hints associating some dwarfs with wisdom, most have none.
This and other evidence has been used to propose a late origin for the poem. But
Thor is responsible for protecting his females, and thus the result of the action
of the poem is appropriate, even if its players strike us as misplaced.

ANDHRÍMNIR (SOOTY-IN-FRONT)
Cook at Valhöll.
The key passage is stanza 18 of Grímnismál.
Andhrímnir in Eldhrímnir
Has Sæhrímnir boiled.
In Gylfaginning Snorri understands the passage as a cook (Andhrímnir)
cooking pork (the pig Sæhrímnir) in a huge pot (Eldhrímnir), and indeed the rest
of this stanza seems to call Sæhrímnir the best of pork and refers to the myste
rious nourishment of the einherjar. All three of the names are joined by the ele
ment hrímnir, which is derived from the word for soot on a cookpot. The
element And- could refer to (or could have been understood by Snorri as refer
ring to) the front of the cook, who would be facing the cookpot as he worked his
culinary magic.

ANDLANG
The second of three heavens in the cosmology of Snorri’s Gylfaginning.
No other text refers to this place or to a second heaven, so it may be Snorri’s
invention. The name appears to mean “stretched out” but might conceivably
derive from a longer form meaning “spiritual heaven.”

Dwarf from whom Loki and the gods extract gold to pay compensation for their
killing of Otr, the son of Hreidmar.
The story is told in Snorri’s Skáldskaparmál, in the prose header and opening
stanzas of Reginsmál in the Poetic Edda, and in Völsunga saga. The gods
involved are Odin, Hœnir, and Loki. Loki kills Otr (“Otter,” who had in fact
taken the form of an otter), and Hreidmar demands compensation. Using Rán’s
58 Norse Mythology



net, Loki captures Andvari, who has been swimming about in the form of a pike,
and extracts from him all his gold, right down to a ring the dwarf wishes to keep.
When Loki insists on having it anyway, the dwarf curses it, saying that it will
lead to death and discord. So it does.
Andvari is also mentioned in the catalog of dwarfs in Völuspá and in the
thulur. The thulur also include the word as a noun for “fish.”

ANGRBODA (SHE-WHO-OFFERS-SORROW)
Giantess mate of Loki and mother of monsters.
The name is found only once in poetry, in Hyndluljód, stanza 40, a part of the
“Short Völuspá.”
Loki sired the wolf on Angrboda,
and got Sleipnir on Svadilfari;
the witch alone seemed most evil
the one that came from the brother of Byleipt.
Snorri makes Angrboda, “a giantess in Jötunheimar,” the mother of three
monsters: the Fenrir wolf; Jörmungand, that is, the Midgard serpent; and Hel.
This raises the possibility that the witch in lines 3–4 of the stanza quoted above
from Hyndluljód may be Hel.

ÁRVAK AND ALSVIN (EARLY-AWAKE AND VERY-SWIFT)
Horses that pull the sun.
Grímnismál, stanza 37, is the main source:
Árvak and Alsvin, they should up from here,
The bold ones, pull the sun;
And under their traces the blithe powers,
The æsir, hid “iron cold.”
The names of the horses are bound by alliteration, and they also occur as a
couple on the other occasion when they appear in verse. This is in Sigrdrífumál,
in a mysterious part of the poem introduced by a stanza saying that Mím’s head
spoke. The very next stanza, number 15, is where the horses appear:
On a shield shall be carved, the one which stands before the shining god,
On the ears of Árvak and on the hoof of Alsvin,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 59



This engraved stone found in Havor, Gotland, might be an unusual depiction of the horses
that pull the sun, Árvak and Alsvin. (The Art Archive/Historiska Museet Stockholm/Dagli
Orti)



On that wheel, which turns itself under the riding of Rungnir,
On Sleipnir’s teeth and on the springs of a sled.
The list goes on, and it becomes no more edifying.
Snorri paraphrases the stanza from Grímnismál in his Gylfaginning, but,
rather uncharacteristically, he has nothing to add about the horses. He does,
however, expand the “iron cold” (ísarn kól) into wind-driven bellows called
“Ísarnkól.”

ÁSA-THOR (THOR-OF-THE-ÆSIR)
Name for Thor.
This name is found in Hárbardsljód, stanza 52, and frequently in Snorri’s Edda.
Although it is sometimes used in cases where Thor’s might is held up to ques
tion (e.g., in the Útgarda-Loki story), it may be going a bit far to regard the name
as ironic.

ÁS-BRÚ (ÆSIR-BRIDGE)
Alternate name for Bilröst, according to Snorri Sturluson in Gylfaginning. He cites
Grímnismál, stanza 29, which may, however, use the word as a common noun rather
than as a name.
See also Bilröst
ÁSGARD (ENCLOSURE-OF-THE-ÆSIR)
The abode of the gods.
The name is found in eddic poetry, in Snorri’s Edda, and, perhaps most interest
ingly, in a fragment of a poem about Thor composed by the late-tenth-century
skald Thorbjörn dísarskáld, who was one of two skalds to leave us poems
addressed to Thor, the only such verse we know of. What Thorbjörn said was
“Thor has defended Ásgard and Ygg’s [Odin’s] people [the gods] with strength.”
The noun -gard, “yard,” is used of the domains of the major groups in the
mythology: Ásgard for the gods, Midgard (Central-enclosure) for humans, and
Útgardar (Outer-enclosures) for the jötnar (the last, however, is found only in
connection with Útgarda-Loki). Within Ásgard was Valhöll.
What makes Ásgard an enclosure is the wall around it, which an elaborate
story in Gylfaginning seems to address. The gods had established Midgard and
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 61



had built Valhöll when a builder came to them and offered to build a fortress so
secure that giants could not get through it. He offered to do the job in a year and
a half against a payment of Freyja, the sun, and the moon. The gods thought they
had cut a great deal when they got him to agree to do the job within half a year
with only the help of his horse Svadilfari. They were mistaken, and when three
days were left it appeared all but certain that the wall would be completed. The
gods blamed Loki and threatened him. Loki changed himself into a mare and dis
tracted Svadilfari. The wall was never completed, and when Thor returned he
killed the giant builder. Loki subsequently gave birth to Sleipnir.
References and further reading: The medieval and folklore analogues to the story of the construction of the wall were long ago pointed out by C. W. von Sydow, “Studier i Finnsägnen och besläktade byggmästarsägner,” Fataburen, 1907: 65–78, 199–218; and 1908: 19–27; Lotte Motz’s discussion, “Snorri’s Story of the Cheated Mason and Its Folklore Parallels,” Maal og minne, 1977: 115–122, adds little. Joseph Harris, “The Masterbuilder Story in Snorri’s Edda and Two Sagas,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 91 (1976): 66–101, argues that Snorri created the story in an attempt to clarify Völuspá, stanzas 25–26. His source would have been an oral legend, retained in two of the Sagas of Icelanders, Eyrbyggja saga and Heidarvíga saga, about two berserks who build a road; this legend was in turn based on the international migratory legend von Sydow had discussed. The argument is quite plausible, but it was disputed by Ursula
Dronke, “Völuspá and Satiric Tradition,” Annali: Sezione germanica: Studi nederlandesi, studi nordici 77 (1979): 57–86, who postulated a lost Lay of Svadilfari as the source of Völuspá, stanzas 25–26.
ASK (ASH-TREE) AND EMBLA
First humans.
The story of the creation of humans is found in Völuspá, stanzas 17–18, and in
Snorri’s Gylfaginning. According to Völuspá, Ask (the first human man) and
Embla (the first human woman) were found on shore, capable of little and fate
less. Odin, Hœnir, and Lódur endowed them with the various qualities they
needed to live. Odin gave breath or spirit, Hœnir gave mental faculties or voice,
and Lódur gave blood, ruddiness, or vital warmth and good coloring. Snorri adds
some details and changes others. The creator gods, according to Snorri, are the
sons of Bor (elsewhere Bur)—Odin, Vili, and Vé—who find two pieces of wood on
the seashore and fashion them into humans. One of Bor’s sons gives spirit and
life; the second, mind and movement; the third, appearance, speech, hearing, and
vision. The sons of Bor also gave these vivified pieces of wood clothing and their
names, Ask and Embla, and from them descend the races of mankind.
In Völuspá, the stanzas about Ask and Embla follow the catalog of dwarfs,
and it is quite possible that stanza 10, which refers to the dwarfs’ making of
62 Norse Mythology



human forms out of the earth, may be involved. In this scenario, the dwarfs
would have formed humans, but the gods would have endowed them with life.
Although Ask clearly means “Ash tree,” the meaning of Embla is uncertain.
“Elm tree” is one possibility, but it encounters serious linguistic obstacles. The
other possibility usually offered is “vine,” and in connection with this option
comes the further suggestion of a relationship between human sexual congress
and the turning of a hardwood such as ash into a soft wood to make fire.

References and further reading: The possible role of the dwarfs in the creation of Ask and Embla is argued forcefully in Gro Steinsland, “Antrogonimyten i Voluspá: En tekst- og tradisjonskritisk analyse,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 98 (1983): 80–107. For Embla as “vine” and the hardwood/softwood hypothesis, see Hans Sperber, “Embla,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur 36 (1910): 219–222.
ATLA
One of nine giant mothers, perhaps of Heimdall, listed in Hyndluljód, stanza 37 (part
of the “Short Völuspá”).
See also Heimdall; Hyndluljód References and further reading: Lotte Motz, “Giantesses and Their Names,” Frühmittelalterliche Studien 15 (1981): 495–511.
AUDHUMLA
The proto-cow, involved in the origin of the races of gods and giants.
Although the name is found among the thulur for “cow,” Audhumla’s mytho
logical role is found only in Snorri’s Gylfaginning. Snorri says that Audhumla
emerged from the drips of rime just after Ymir was formed, and that four streams
of milk ran from her udders and nourished Ymir. She in turn licked salt blocks,
and from these there emerged in three days Búri, the first of the æsir.
Although cows are not uncommon in creation stories from around the
world, what is most striking about Audhumla is that she unites the two groups
of warring groups in the mythology, by nourishing Ymir, ancestor of all the
giants, and bringing into the light Búri, progenitor of the æsir. The presumed ety
mology of her name, “hornless cow rich in milk,” is of no help in interpreting
her mythological role.

AURBODA (GRAVEL-OFFERER)
Giantess, mother of Gerd, Frey’s wife.
The relevant source is Hyndluljód, stanza 30, lines 5–8:
Frey possessed Gerd, she was the daughter of Gymir [corrected from Geymir]
Of the race of giants, and of Aurboda.
In Gylfaginning Snorri repeated this information.
Stanza 38 of Fjölsvinnsmál, which is stanza 54 in the poem editors create
out of Grógald and Fjölsvinnsmál and which they call Svipdagsmál, also men
tions an Aurboda. She occurs in a list of nine maidens who sit at the knees of
Menglöd. Although Menglöd is a giantess, these are not giantess names—one,
indeed, is Eir, an ásynja according to Snorri, and the others are adjectives like
bright, blithe, and fair. I doubt that we are dealing with the same Aurboda in
both cases.
See also Frey, Gerd
AURGELMIR (MUD-YELLER)
Primeval giant.
In Vafthrúdnismál Odin asks Vafthrúdnir who was the oldest of the æsir or kin
of Ymir. Vafthrúdnir says Bergelmir was born many years before the earth was
formed; his father was Thrúdgelmir and his grandfather Aurgelmir. Odin now
asks (stanza 30), whence Aurgelmir first came among the sons of the jötnar. The
giant responds:
From the Élivágar spurted poison drops,
Thus it grew, until a giant emerged.
Odin now asks how that giant got children, since he had no pleasure of
giantesses. Vafthrúdnir responds in stanza 33:
Under an arm of the frost giant, they say, grew
A maiden and lad together;
A leg got on a leg of the wise [or fruitful] giant
A six-headed son.
Snorri quotes these verses but says that Aurgelmir was the name the frost
giants used for Ymir. Since that would be unique, we must again assume that
Snorri was systematizing, although it is also true that the hermaphroditic
64 Norse Mythology



birthing process fits better etymologically with Ymir (whose name has to do
with doubling) than with Aurgelmir.
See also Bergelmir; Thrúdgelmir; Ymir
AURVANDIL
Giant (?) whose toe was made into a star by Thor; husband of Gróa.
According to Snorri’s account of Thor’s duel with Hrungnir in Skáldskaparmál,
Thor was visited by the seeress Gróa, who sang charms over him and thereby
loosened the whetstone that was lodged in Thor’s head after the duel.
And when Thor learned that and thought it likely that the whetstone would be
removed, then he wanted to repay Gróa for her cure and make her happy. He
told her that he had been wading from the north across the Élivágar and had car
ried Aurvandil on his back in a basket out of Jötunheimar, and a sign of it was
that one of Aurvandil’s toes had stuck out of the basket and frozen, and Thor
broke it off and cast it into the sky and made of it that star which is called Aur
vandil’s Toe. Thor said that it would not be long before Aurvandil would come
home, and Gróa became so happy that she forgot the charms and the whetstone
grew no looser.
Although the etymology of the name is unknown, it is cognate with Old
English earendel, “dawn, ray of light,” so there may be a Germanic myth here,
despite the absence of Aurvandil from the Norse poetic corpus. Thor also made
stars out of Thjazi’s eyes, and in my view we should read these acts as his con
tribution to cosmogony, an area in which he is otherwise absent.
References and further reading: Rudolf Much, “Aurvandils tá,” Altschlesien 5 (1934): 387–388, speculates on the star that Aurvandil’s toe may represent.
BALDR
God, member of the æsir group, killed by his blind half brother Höd, buried in a
solemn funeral, and left in the world of the dead when an attempt to retrieve him
fails.
The death of Baldr is one of the most important moments in the mythology.
Parts of the story are alluded to in various skaldic poems; much of it is told in
the Codex Regius version of Völuspá, and Snorri gives a full version in Gylfagin
ning, using a probably oral version of Völuspá and other sources. According to
Snorri, Baldr is the second son of Odin, after Thor, and “about him there is good
to report; he is the best, and all praise him; he is so fair of face and bright that he
seems to shine, and one plant is so white that it is compared to Baldr’s brows;
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 65



that is the whitest of all plants, and from it you can note his beauty, both of hair
and of face; he is the wisest of the æsir and the most eloquent, and the most
merciful, but that nature accompanies him, that none of his judgments stands.
He lives where it is called Breidablik; that is in heaven; in that place nothing
can be nothing impure.” A few pages later Snorri reports that Forseti is the son
of Baldr and Nanna Nepsdóttir. Later in the Gylfaginning he tells about Baldr’s
death and its aftermath, and these stories take up about 10 percent of the entire
Gylfaginning.
Baldr’s death actually comprises several constituent parts, and Snorri is the
first to combine them all in one fluid narrative, even if Völuspá, a version of
which he clearly had before him, tells most of the story. These parts may con
veniently be divided as follows: Baldr’s death, his funeral, the attempted revival,
and vengeance for him.
The story of Baldr’s death and the attempted revival are intertwined, by
Snorri at least. It begins, according to him, with Baldr suffering disquieting
dreams, presumably that he may be injured or killed. Frigg elicits an oath not to
harm him from all things, and thereafter the æsir take sport in attacking him
with weapons and stones, and it seems an accomplishment to them that he is
unhurt. Loki is displeased that Baldr is unhurt. He takes the form of a woman,
goes to Frigg, and asks whether anything can harm Baldr. Frigg responds that she
took oaths from everything except mistletoe, which seemed too young. Loki gets
some mistletoe, fashions a spear from it, and heads to the assembly. There he sees
Baldr’s blind half brother, Höd, not participating in the sport. He gives the mistle
toe spear to Höd, who casts it at Baldr. It pierces Baldr, and he falls dead to the
earth. “The greatest misfortune among gods and men was done,” says Snorri.
The gods are stricken, and no vengeance can be taken on the spot because it
is a place of sanctuary. Frigg asks for a volunteer to go to Hel to try to retrieve
Baldr. Hermód, another son (or a servant) of Odin volunteers. Borrowing Sleip
nir, he travels nine nights until he comes to the Gjallar bridge (Gjallarbrú, the
bridge between earth and the underworld), where he is challenged by the maiden
Módgud. She tells him that the way to Hel is down and north. He rides on,
comes to Hel, and sees that Baldr is in the high seat (the seat of honor) in her
hall. Hel agrees to release Baldr if all things, living and dead, will weep for him.
Bearing tokens from the underworld, Hermód returns to the land of the living.
Emissaries are sent to request that everything weep for Baldr, and just when the
attempt appears to have succeeded, they come upon an old lady who calls her
self Thökk (Thanks). She speaks a verse: “Thökk will weep / dry tears / about
Baldr’s funeral; / I had no use for Karl’s son, / alive or dead; / let Hel keep what
she has.” People think, Snorri explains, that this old lady who kept Baldr with
Hel was Loki.
66 Norse Mythology



While Hermód was undertaking his journey, according to Snorri, Baldr’s
funeral took place. Snorri was probably following the skald Úlf Uggason’s Hús
drápa here, a poem that describes the rich carved decorations in the newly built
hall of Óláf pái (Peacock) from around 1185 or so in western Iceland. Here is
what Húsdrápa says about the funeral:
The battle-wise Frey rides on a boar, bristled with gold, first to the pyre of the
son of Odin, and leads armies. The exceedingly widely famous Hropta-Ty ́r
[Odin] rides to the pyre of his son. There I perceive valkyries and ravens accom
pany the wise victory-tree [man; here Odin] to the blood of the holy corpse.
Thus [the hall] is adorned from within with things remembered. The excellent
Heimdall rides a horse to that pyre that the gods had built for the fallen son of
the very wise tester of the raven [Odin]. The very powerful Hild of the moun
tains [giantess] caused the sea-Sleipnir [ship] to trudge forward; but the wielders
of the helmet flames of Hropt [Odin] felled her mount.
Snorri has more detail. He adds several gods to the list of those who
attended, and he makes sense out of the stanza with the giantess in it by stating
that the funeral ship could not be launched and that the gods therefore sent to
Jötunheimar for that ogress who was called Hyrrokkin. “She arrived riding a wolf
with poisonous snakes for reins, and when she dismounted, Odin called to four
berserks to look after the horse, and they could not hold it unless they killed it.
Then Hyrrokkin went to the prow of the ship and shot it forward at the first try
so that sparks leapt out of the runners and all the lands shook.” Thor was
enraged and would have killed her had the gods not pleaded for amnesty for her.
Thor kicked a little dwarf named Lit into the fire, and Nanna died of grief and
was put on the pyre with Baldr. The ring Draupnir and Baldr’s horse were also
burned with him.
The vengeance sequence comprises two parts. The first, regarding which
Snorri is silent in Gylfaginning, is told in Völuspá: “Baldr’s brother was / quickly
born; / that son of Odin / killed when he was one night old.” In Skáldskaparmál,
Snorri reports that kennings for Váli include “enemy of Höd and his killer.”
Vengeance is also taken on Loki, and here Snorri has a very detailed narrative
(the prose following Lokasenna in the Poetic Edda tells much the same story but
says that the gods were taking vengeance for Loki’s reviling of them). Loki runs
off to a mountain and sequesters himself in a house with four doors out of which
he peers to watch for the æsir’s attack. Frequently changing himself into a
salmon, he anticipates the strategy of the æsir and makes a net but burns it and
leaps into the river as they approach. Seeing the pattern in the ashes, Kvasir
understands the potential it represents, and the æsir pursue Loki with a net.
Twice he evades them, but on the third try he attempts a leap over the net and
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 67



Thor grabs him by the tail, which is why salmon to this day are thin by the tail.
The æsir take Loki to a cave, where they bind him to the rock. They change one
of his sons into a wolf and have it tear the other to pieces. They suspend a poi
sonous snake over him, dripping venom. His wife Sigyn catches the venom in a
pot, but when she goes to empty it the venom falls onto his face, and his
writhings cause earthquakes.
Saxo Grammaticus has a rather different story of Baldr’s death and the after
math. Høtherus, the foster son of King Gevarus, and Balderus, the son of Othi
nus and a demigod, have both fallen in love with Nanna. Høtherus acquires a
special sword and a magic ring. Nanna refuses Balderus on the grounds that
demigods and humans are incompatible. Høtherus and an ally confront Balderus
and the gods in a sea battle and gain victory when Høtherus slices the handle off
Thor’s hammer, the gods’ major weapon, with his magic sword.
Høtherus marries Nanna. In a subsequent battle Balderus defeats him.
Balderus is plagued by dreams of his desired Nanna. Høtherus is now chosen
king of the Danes, but in his absence the Danes vote again, and this time they
choose Balderus. In a third battle Høtherus is put to flight. In their final battle
he wounds Balderus. Balderus dreams of Proserpina (as Saxo calls her, using the
Roman name for the Greek Persephone, who like Hel presided over the under
world), dies, and is buried in a mound.
The story now turns to vengeance. A sorcerer advises Othinus that he must
seduce Rinda, the daughter of the king of the Rutenians. After three failed
attempts, first disguised as a warrior, then as a smith, and then as a knight, Oth
inus returns a fourth time, disguised as a woman, and becomes a serving maid
to the princess. When Rinda falls sick, Othinus arranges for her to be tied down
so that she can be given some medicine. He rapes her, and she bears Bous, who
kills Høtherus.
These stories are indeed quite different, but there are important similarities
that go beyond Höd killing Baldr and having vengeance taken on him. Dreams
are important in both versions, as is a magic weapon. The goddess of the dead
plays a role in each. The rape of Rinda is paralleled in medieval Icelandic tradi
tion in a skaldic stanza that states that Odin used the magic seid on Rind, the
mother of Váli. The differences in the versions may reflect variants in medieval
Icelandic oral tradition, since Saxo learned from Icelanders, but he may also be
passing along some genuine Danish traditions.
The story has led to many attempts at interpretation, some of them rather
fanciful. The mistletoe remains unexplained, despite Sir James Frazer’s attempt
to build up a grand theory around it. In fact, the story may have far less to do
with the fertility exemplified by various gods who die (in the fall) and are reborn
(in the spring) than it does with initiation into a hypothetical cult of Odin. Thus
68 Norse Mythology



Höd’s name seems to have meant “battle,” and his blindness intensifies Odin’s
sacrifice of a single eye. Gautreks saga contains a sham sacrifice to Odin that
turns real. When Starkad throws at King Víkar a reed that has been provided to
him by another person, the reed turns into a spear and kills the king.
However, analysis of the Baldr story as Odinic ritual runs up against the fact
that in Völuspá Baldr’s death leads directly to Ragnarök (and the victory of
Høtherus over all the gods in Saxo may be analogous). For Snorri, too, Baldr’s
death was a disaster that led to Ragnarök. I understand the story as the mythic
reflection of a basic social problem, namely, the fact that a society that used
blood feud to resolve disputes—as medieval and presumably saga Iceland did
could not deal with a killing within a family. Simply by requiring a counterat
tack against the family of the killer, Höd’s killing of Baldr puts Odin in an
impossible situation. He turns outside the kin group to sire the avenger
Váli/Bous, but that is no solution, since it simply displaces the problem of
brother killing brother. The Old English epic poem Beowulf has a story that
looks cognate, in which one brother, Hædcyn (Höd) mistakenly kills another,
Herebeald (Baldr?). Hredel, the father, dies of grief.

In her Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Icelandic Society, vol. 1: The Myths (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), Margaret Clunies Ross stresses the dynastic implications of the story: Baldr is Odin’s legitimate heir, and his death brings about a crisis of succession.

BALDRS DRAUMAR (BALDR’S DREAMS)
Eddic poem.
Found not in Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda but only in the other main man
uscript, AM 748, the poem comprises 14 stanzas in fornyrƒislag. It begins with
the æsir in a state of crisis over Baldr’s bad dreams. Odin rides to Hel. He is con
fronted by a hellhound but rides east of Hel’s hall, where he knows the grave of
a seeress lies. Aroused, she asks his identity, and he says that he is Vegtam
(Accustomed-to-the-road). From stanza 6 onward the poem consists of a series of
questions put by Odin and answered by the seeress. The seeress concludes each
response except the last by saying she was forced to speak and now will fall
silent, but Odin always forces her to continue. First, Odin asks for whom the
hall of Hel has been prepared; the seeress answers that it is for Baldr. Second,
Odin asks who will kill Baldr, and the answer is Höd. The third question is who
will avenge Baldr, and the answer is apparently Váli (the name is omitted in the
manuscript but a name beginning with V is required to complete the allitera
tion). The fourth and last question is not clear but has to do with the identity of
a group of maidens. Somehow, in a way we no longer understand, the question
reveals to the seeress that she is conversing with Odin. To this Odin replies,
“You are not a seeress, / nor a wise woman, / but rather of three / giants the
mother” (stanza 13). “Go home,” she says. The next step is Ragnarök.
The version of the myth of Baldr’s death here omits the role of Loki, which
is so important in Snorri’s version, although some observers have seen a refer
ence to Loki in the mother of three giants of stanza 13, since Loki’s children are
three of the most famous giants, namely, the Midgard serpent, the wolf Fenrir,
and Hel herself. This version would seem to focus on the essentials: Baldr will
die, Höd will kill him, Váli will avenge Baldr’s death. That is a departure from
Snorri’s version far greater, in fact, than the omission of Loki’s role, for Snorri
has nothing to say of vengeance on Höd. Most sources seem to agree that the
vengeance is an integral part of the myth.
In form, Baldrs draumar shares much with the other eddic contests of wis
dom, especially Vafthrúdnismál, which also has an unclear reference to a group
of females near the end of the poem and a question that reveals Odin’s identity,
although in Vafthrúdnimsál and Baldrs draumar these are not the same question.
Although there are striking verbal parallels with Thrymskvida, few observers

BÁLEYG (FLAME-EYE)
Odin name.
Odin himself includes this in the list of names he gives just before the epiphany
in Grímnismál (stanza 47). The Icelandic skald Hallfred Óttarson vandrædaskáld
used the kenning “Báleyg’s wife” to refer to the earth in stanza 6 of his
Hákonardrápa, composed for Hákon the Hladir jarl toward the end of the tenth
century, and in the early twelfth century Gísli Illugason called warriors “trees of
Báleyg” in a memorial to the Norwegian king Magnús Bareleg. The name is also
found in the thulur. The flame must be metaphorical, a reference to the fierce
gaze of Odin’s one eye.
In Grímnismál Báleyg follows and alliterates with Bileyg (Wavering-eye),
and this name pair has been associated with Bolwisus and Bilwisus in Book 6 of
the Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus, two old men who counsel King
Sigarus in the Hagbard and Signe story. Bilwisus works to reconcile enemies,
while Bolwisus sows dissension, even among friends. Many observers have
accepted that what Saxo says here reflects two sides of Odin, a distinction that
is contrasted in the names Bileyg and Báleyg.

BARRI
The trysting place where Frey will meet Gerd, his giant bride-to-be.
We have the story in Skírnismál and in an abbreviated form in Snorri’s Gylfagin
ning. In brief, after Frey’s emissary Skírnir has cajoled Gerd, the giantess with
whom Frey has fallen in love from afar, she agrees to meet him in nine nights’
time at Barri (Barrey, according to Snorri).
Magnus Olsen’s hoary explanation, that Barri has to do with barr, “barley,”
ties the story to a hypothetical fertility myth, in which Skírnir is understood
as the sun’s ray and the ensuing marriage as a holy wedding of a god and the
earth. Those who are unpersuaded point out that barr can just as well mean
“pine needle,” which would fit with the fact that Skírnismál explicitly calls
Barri a grove, that Snorri’s Barrey (Barley-island or Grain-island) makes no
sense in the context of a fertility myth, and that in both texts the marriage is
in fact postponed. However, no other explanations of the names themselves
have been proposed.

BAUGI (RING-SHAPED)
Giant, brother of Suttung, the giant from whom Odin obtained the mead of poetry.
Baugi is known only from Snorri’s Edda and from the thulur and is not attested
anywhere in poetry. In Skáldskaparmál Snorri has Odin setting forth to obtain the
mead. He comes upon nine slaves who are cutting hay and sharpens their scythes
with a whetstone he has brought along. The scythes are so much sharper that each
of the slaves wants the whetstone for himself, and as they are contending over
who might purchase it, Odin throws the hone in the air. As they scramble to get
it, they cut each other’s throats. At this point we learn that these slaves worked
for Baugi, and Odin, calling himself Bölverk (Evil-deed), offers to do the work of
nine men, for a wage of one drink of the mead. Baugi says that Suttung alone con
trols the mead but that he will help. After the summer work season is over,
Bölverk/Odin asks for his payment, and when Suttung flatly refuses a single drop
of the mead, Bölverk/Odin enlists Baugi’s help. They drill into the mountain, and
when Baugi says the tunnel is finished, Bölverk/Odin blows into the hole. But
chips fly back, indicating the other end is still blocked. Bölverk/Odin realizes that
Baugi wishes to deceive him. They drill again. Odin then turns himself into a
snake and slithers into the hole. Baugi strikes at him but misses, and thereupon
he vanishes from the mythology as quickly and puzzlingly as he has entered it.
The major problem with Baugi is his absence outside Snorri, especially from
Hávamál, which Snorri seems to be paraphrasing in most of the story of the
acquisition of the mead of poetry. A. G. van Hamel argued that Snorri found
Baugi in another source (indeed, that Odin obtained the mead from Baugi) and
that the version we have in Skáldskaparmál is thus an artful blending of the two
sources. Others have argued that Snorri invented Baugi, and Aage Kabell thought
he knew why: because he misunderstood stanza 110 of Hávamál:
A ring oath [baugeiƒr] I think Odin made,
What good are his pledges?
He left Suttung deceived from the feast
And made Gunnlöd weep.
The problem with this hypothesis is that ring oaths were tolerably well
known in medieval Iceland, and the stanza is really quite clear. If Margaret Clu
72 Norse Mythology



nies Ross is right in reviving an argument that a ring might stand for the anus in
certain contexts and thus be involved in innuendo concerning ergi (sexual per
version), Snorri may have been indulging in wordplay; or he may even have
imagined a kind of symbolic rape of Suttung through Baugi alongside his rape of
Gunnlöd, Suttung’s daughter.

Blom), 76–85. On Baugi and the ring, see Aage Kabell, “Baugi und der Ringeid,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 90 (1975): 30–40.

BELI
Giant killed by Frey.
This appears to be one of those lost myths that can be glimpsed only in passing.
In kennings Frey is called “killer of Beli,” but the only reference to how it might
have happened is in Snorri’s Gylfaginning. Just after sketching the story of the
arrangement of Frey’s marriage to Gerd, Snorri adds that because Frey gave
Skírnir his sword, he was weaponless when he fought with Beli, and therefore he
killed the giant with the horn of a hart. Because in Skírnismál, stanza 36, Gerd
complains of the slaying of her brother by Frey, some observers have wished to
believe that Beli was Gerd’s brother.

BERGBÚA THÁTTR (THE TALE OF THE MOUNTAIN-DWELLER)
Tale incorporating a poem spoken by a thirteenth-century giant, including many
mythological references.
The text is retained in manuscripts from the end of the fourteenth century but
is usually assigned to the thirteenth century. It tells of how one Thórd and his
servant got lost on their way to church in winter and took shelter for the night
in a cave. There they heard noises, saw a pair of huge burning eyes, and finally
heard the owner of those eyes recite a well-crafted poem of 12 stanzas, repeating
it three times over the course of the evening. In the poem the speaker refers to
himself as a bjarg-álfr, “mountain-elf,” which is a kenning for giant and refers
to his journeys around mountains and north to the Élivágar in the third nether
world. He has, he says, a house all to himself on the lava field, but few visit him
there. In short, he appears to be a supernatural nature being such as have been
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 73



commonly found in European folklore until very recently—a lone denizen of the
areas far from where humans live. But this particular giant has ties to Norse
mythology. “Strong Thor makes trouble for people,” he says in stanza 10, and “the
earth is rent, because I say that Thor thus again came thither,” he adds in stanza
11. The word “people” in stanza 10 could, in the language of poetry, refer to the
speaker’s people, that is, the giants, or it could refer to everyone in the world. The
rest of the poem indulges in prophecies: The mountains will tumble, the earth will
move, men will be scoured in hot water and burned by fire, and so forth, and this
may be a mix of the destruction of the race of giants and of humans, as in Ragnarök
(Surt’s fire is mentioned in stanza 10). But many of the predictions of disruption
on earth could also fit the volcanic activity that is so common in Iceland.
At the end of the poem the speaker tells his listeners to remember it or bear
a punishment. Thórd has it word-for-word, but the servant does not. He dies a
year after the night in the cave. The cave itself cannot be located, and Thórd
moves closer to the church.

BERGELMIR (BEAR-YELLER, MOUNTAIN-YELLER, OR BARE-YELLER)
Giant, one of those from whom giants traced their genealogy.
Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 29, states the lineage of Bergelmir. Odin has asked
Vafthrúdnir who was the oldest of the æsir or of the kin of Ymir. Vafthrúdnir
responds,
A great many years before the earth was formed,
Bergelmir was born;
Thrúdgelmir was the father of this one,
And Aurgelmir the grandfather.
After asking about the monstrous birth of the offspring of Aurgelmir, Odin
asks what Vafthrúdnir’s oldest memory is. Vafthrúdnir responds in stanza 35:
A great many years before the earth was formed,
Bergelmir was born;
What I first remember is when the wise giant
Was placed on a lúƒr.
This verse has occasioned all sorts of speculation. Snorri wrote in Gylfagin
ning that it had to do with a flood story. After the sons of Bor killed Ymir, his
blood flooded the earth and “with it all of the frost giants were killed, except one
who got away with his family. The giants called that one Bergelmir. He got up
74 Norse Mythology



on his lúƒr along with his wife and saved himself there, and from them come the
families of the frost giants.”
Snorri clearly understood the lúƒr as something that would float, and the
word might in fact have meant “coffin” or “chest” or some wooden part of a mill;
the expected meaning, of a cumbersome musical instrument something like an
alphorn, makes no sense either in Snorri or his poetic source. If there is any con
sensus here, it is that what Vafthrúdnir remembered was the funeral of Bergelmir,
and what Snorri made of it was an analogue to the Judeo-Christian flood story.
See also Aurgelmir; Thrúdgelmir; Vafthrúdnismál; Ymir References and further reading: The best interpretation of the issues surrounding Bergelmir and his lúƒr remains that of Anne Holtsmark, “Det norrøne ord lúƒr,” Maal og minne, 1946: 49–65.
BERSERKS
Furious warriors, in mythology associated with Odin.
The passage in question is chapter 6 of Snorri’s Ynglinga saga, which also pro
vides a description of berserksgangr, “going berserk.” After stating that Odin
could make his enemies blind, deaf, or overcome with fear in battle, their
weapons useless, Snorri added, “but his men went without armor and were
crazed as dogs or wolves, bit their shields, were strong as bears or bulls. They
killed men, but neither fire nor iron affected them. That is called going berserk.”
Other than this passage, berserks seem to have belonged more to the world
of men than of gods, which agrees with the project of euhemerism Snorri had
adopted with Ynglinga saga. The skaldic poem Haraldskvædi, assembled from
various fragments and generally attributed to a poet called Thorbjörn hornklofi,
assigns berserks to the forces of King Harald Fairhair at the battle of Hafrsfjörd
(late ninth century): “The berserks howled, / battle was on their minds, / the
wolf-skins growled / and shook their spears” (stanza 8b). In stanza 20 the poet
asks about berserks, “who drink blood,” and answers himself: “They are called
wolf-skins, / who in battle / carry bloody shields; / they redden spears / when
they come to battle” (stanza 21a).
According to chapter 9 of Vatnsdæla saga, one of the Sagas of Icelanders, prob
ably composed in the years just before 1280, Harald Fairhair had berserks on board
his ship who were called úlfhednar; they wore wolfskins and defended the prow.
The connection between wolf-skins and berserks supports one of the sug
gested etymologies for medieval Icelandic berserkr, namely, “bear-shirt,” and
this etymology is ordinarily mentioned in light of such warrior-animal amalga
mations as those on the Torslunda helmet plates from Sweden, which suggest
warriors wearing animal skins, masks, or both. Adherents of this etymology see
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 75



a connection with a reconstructed
Odin cult, which in turn, they argue,
may reflect Indo-European ecstatic
warrior cults usually known by the
German scholarly term Männerbünde
(sing., Männerbund). The other pro
posed etymology of berserkr is “bare
shirt.” Snorri’s statement about the
lack of armor appears to support this
etymology, although there is always
the possibility that Snorri wrote these
words because of his own understand
ing of the etymology.
Beside Harald Fairhair and the
Odin of Ynglinga saga, other kings in
older Scandinavian literary tradition
are accorded berserks as elite troops,
and the medieval Icelandic law code,
Grágás, has a provision against going
berserk. Elsewhere in medieval Ice
landic literature, however, berserks are
mostly stereotypical figures who
threaten but are easily overcome by
heroes, sometimes after challenging
for the hand of a woman. Although
there may be a parallel here with the
lusting of the giants for Freyja and the
other female æsir, the only direct con
nection between berserks and the
mythology is the passage from Snorri.
If, however, there indeed was a cult of
warriors in animal disguise, it would
almost certainly have centered around
Odin.

BESTLA
Odin’s mother.
The relationship of Bestla and Odin is set forth in Snorri’s Gylfaginning. The
first man was Búri, whose son was Bor.
He married that woman who was called Bestla, the daughter of the giant
Bölthorn. They had three sons; the first was called Odin, the second Vili, the
third Vé.
Hávamál, stanza 140, gives a variant version of the name, Bölthor, and
makes him Bestla’s grandfather:
Nine magic songs I got from the famous son
Of Bölthor, Bestla’s father,
And I got a drink of the precious mead,
Poured from [by? to?] Ódrerir.
Although there is nothing in this stanza indicating a family relationship
with Odin, and although the mead was, according to other sources, stolen, it is
not inconceivable that Odin could have obtained magic songs from his maternal
uncle (the verb in the first line, literally “got,” also means “learned”). And
skalds knew of Bestla as Odin’s mother and formed kennings based on the rela
tionship. One manuscript of Snorri’s Edda says that one may make Odin ken
nings by calling him “father of Bestla or of his other children,” but since this
contradicts the other sources and is absent from the other manuscripts, we need
not pay it too much attention.
It is of course significant that Odin is descended from the giants on his
mother’s side, since the slaying of Ymir by him and his brothers must therefore
be understood as a killing within a family, the slaying or denial of a maternal
relation. Another theory, however, advanced by Waltraud Hunke, sees Bestla as
the bark of the world tree, on which Odin was perhaps born (or reborn in an ini
tiation?) according to Hávamál, stanza 141 (“then I started to grow fruitful”).
Hunke would then understand Bestla etymologically as the bark of the mater
nal tree.

BEYLA
Mythological character.
Beyla is found only in the prose header to Lokasenna and stanzas 55–56 of the
poem. The prose header says that she and Byggvir were servants of Frey. In
stanza 55 she warns Loki that Thor is approaching and will silence the one slan
dering all the gods. Loki replies in stanza 56: “Shut up, Beyla! / You are Byggvir’s
wife / and much mixed with evil; / a greater monster / never came among the
sons of the gods; / you are entirely filthy, milkmaid.” Beyla is one of those fig
ures for whom scholars have had to turn to etymology for interpretation, but the
problem is that the etymology is anything but clear. Her name may be related to
a word for “cow,” “bean,” or “bee.” Why Loki should accuse her of being
entirely filthy remains unclear.

BIL AND HJÚKI
Children who accompany the moon, according to Snorri Sturluson.
Snorri includes them in his discussion of the moon in Gylfaginning; they were
taken up from earth as they left the well called Byrgir, carrying a bucket and a
pole. Their father was Vidfinn (Wood-Finn). Now they accompany the moon, as
can be seen from the earth.
These names are found only in this passage, with one exception: Later in
Gylfaginning Snorri says that, along with Sól (Sun), Bil, “whose nature was
explained above,” is numbered among the æsir. The absence of this whole moon
story from other sources has led many observers to the conclusion that they lack
mythic significance, or even that Snorri invented them, but Anne Holtsmark
advanced a plausible argument to the effect that Snorri had a now lost verse
source, probably a learned riddle in which Bil and Hjúki represented the waning
and waxing moon. Holtsmark thinks it possible that Bil was one of the dísir
(female spirits).

Mana: Mit einem Anhang über den Bilwis,” Språkvetenskapliga sällskapets i Uppsala förhandlingar, 1928–1930: 17–156, thought that the root bil meant “supernatural power” and referred to a concept like mana, a supernatural power in gods and objects.

BILEYG (WAVERING-EYE)
Odin name.
Odin himself includes this in the list of names he gives just before the epiphany
in Grímnismál (stanza 47). It is not, however, known from other sources,
although it is listed among the thulur.
This name is found in the same line, and alliterates with Báleyg (Flame-eye),
and some observers think two sides of Odin are represented in the pair.
See also Báleyg; Odin
BILLING’S GIRL
Subject of a section of the poem Hávamál, one of the so-called Odin’s examples.
Told in the first person by Odin, the section begins by announcing that Odin
awaited his beloved (presumably Billing’s girl) in the reeds. She was dear to him
but he had never possessed her. He found Billing’s girl asleep on the bed and
desired her. She made an assignation with him. He returned for this assignation,
but the way was blocked by flame and an efficient warrior band. In the morning
he returned and found a bitch bound on the bed in place of the woman. Stanza
102 appears to be a reflection on the episode and has numerous verbal parallels
with stanza 96. Stanzas 96 and 102 therefore bracket the incident.
Sigurƒur Nordal understood the episode as a display of the magic of Billing’s
girl, who thwarted Odin’s advances by deflecting his magic powers onto a dog on
her bed. In this light, the binding of the dog would be a magic binding imposed
by Odin in anticipation of a rape. Most other observers content themselves with
contrasting the failed seduction with the successful seduction of Gunnlöd in the
following episode in the poem.
Billing is listed as a dwarf name in the Hauksbók version of Völuspá and is
found in a kenning for poetry: “cup of the son of Billing.” Since both the dwarfs
and giants possessed the mead of poetry before Odin retrieved it, this kenning
works whether Billing is a dwarf or a giant. The problem with understanding
Billing as a dwarf is not one of sexual congress between gods and dwarfs, for
Freyja slept with three dwarfs to obtain the Brísinga men, and the dwarf Alvíss
coveted Thor’s daughter and even claimed to have affianced himself to her
(Alvíssmál). However, if Billing is a dwarf, his “girl” (presumably daughter)
would be one of the very few female dwarfs in the mythology. Certainly Billing’s
girl is a member of an out-group, and Odin seduces and rapes many of these.
The most telling analogue is stanza 18 of Hárbardsljód, in which Odin
boasts of having his way with giant girls on the island Algrœn (All-green) in pre
cisely the same language he uses in Hávamál, stanza 99, for his desire for
Billing’s daughter: To possess a woman is to have “all her mind and pleasure.” If
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 79



the common language indicates a common story, the reeds in stanza 96 would
be near the island Algrœn, but that is surmise.
Odin ought not to come up short in any of his encounters, and for that rea
son it is useful to speculate on how Odin’s failure to seduce Billing’s girl may in
fact be a success. I have suggested that failing to sleep with the bitch keeps him
from committing an act of bestiality, which properly belongs in the realm of the
giants. A parallel in Icelandic folklore in which the motif of a bitch bound in
place of a girl is used to prevent father-daughter incest may also be relevant.

W. K. Gleerup; Copenhagen: Levin & Munksgaard, 1936), 288–295, and John Lindow, “Billings mær,” in Gudar på jorden: Festskrift till Lars Lönnroth, ed.

BILRÖST
The bridge between the world of humans and the world of the gods or between earth
and heaven.
Grímnismál, stanza 44, is a list of the foremost or best of things: Yggdrasil of
trees, Odin of æsir, and so forth. There Bilröst is called best of bridges. In Fáfnis
mál, stanza 15, Fáfnir responds to a question asking what the island is called
where Surt and the æsir will fight, presumably at Ragnarök.
Óskópnir it is called, and there shall all
The gods make play with spears;
Bilröst will break, when they go away,
And horses will swim in the current.
Bilröst is compounded of bil, “stopping place, time, instant, weak spot,” and
röst, ordinarily “league” or “current” but here apparently with the meaning
“road.” Snorri uses instead the form “Bifröst,” whose first component has to do
with wavering or shaking. Snorri mentions “Bifröst” several times. Asked about
the path to heaven from earth, Hár tells Gylfi/Gangleri that it is Bilröst, that the
gods made it, and that it may be called the rainbow. It is of three colors, very
strong, and made with great skill and knowledge, but it will break when the sons
of Muspell ride over it. Nothing can survive the harrying of the sons of Muspell,
and much later in the text, describing Ragnarök, Snorri says that Bilröst will
break, “as was previously stated.” Jafnhár also tells Gylfi/Gangleri that the gods
ride this bridge, which may also be called the Ás-Brú (Æsir-bridge), up to the
Urdarbrunn (Well-of-Urd), where they go to make judgments. And a bit after
80 Norse Mythology



that, Gylfi/Gangleri asks whether fire burns over Bilröst. Hár responds that the
red “in the bow” is indeed fire, and he implies that it is there to keep the giants
away. From Gylfaginning we also learn that at the upper end of the bridge there
stands Himinbjörg, where Heimdall lives.
Fire on the bridge is also found in Grímnismál, stanza 29, which reports that
Thor crosses the rivers Körmt and Örmt and two named Kerlaug each day when
he goes to judge at the ash of Yggdrasil,
Because the Ás-Brú burns all with fire,
The holy waters boil.
The notion of the bridge between earth and heaven, or earth and the world
of the gods, has a parallel in the Gjallarbrú, a bridge between earth and the
underworld, or earth and the world of the dead.
See also Gjallarbrú References and further reading: Åke Ohlmarks, “Stellt die mythische Bilröst den Regenbogen oder die Milchstrasse dar? Eine textkritische-religionshistorische Untersuchung zur mythographischen Arbeitsmethode Snorri Sturlusons,” Meddelanden från Lunds astronomiska observatorium, ser. 2, 110 (1940):
1–40, asks whether Bilröst represents the rainbow or the Milky Way and concludes that Bilröst originally was the Milky Way but that Snorri reinterpreted the bridge as the rainbow when confronted with the variations in the terminology. Bilröst as the Milky Way is hardly a new concept; see, for example, Franz Rolf Schröder, Germanentum und Hellenismus: Untersuchungen zur
germanischen Religionsgeschichte, Germanische Bibliothek, Abteilung 2, vol. 17 (Heidelberg: C. Winter, 1924). William MacArthur thought he saw Bilröst among “Norse Myths Illustrated on Ancient Manx Crosses,” Notes and Queries, ser. 11, 5 (1912): 506, but no one else has done so.
BILSKÍRNIR
Thor’s hall.
Grímnismál, stanza 24, has Odin reveal the following vision as he catalogs the
dwellings of the gods:
Five hundred rooms and forty
There are, I think, under the arches of Bilskírnir
Of those halls which I know to be roofed,
My son’s is the biggest.
In Gylfaginning, when he introduces Thor, Snorri has Hár say that Thor has
a kingdom at Thrúdvangar and a hall called Bilskírnir with 540 rooms, which is
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 81



the greatest of buildings. He then cites this verse. In Skáldskaparmál Snorri says
that “owner of Bilskírnir” is a valid Thor kenning, and in fact “prince of Bil
skírnir” is attested in the skaldic corpus.
The meaning of the name is unclear, but it seems to be either “suddenly
illuminated [by lightning]” or “everlasting.”
See also Thrúdvangar
BLÁIN
In Völuspá, stanza 9, apparently an alternate name for Ymir:
Then all the powers went to their judgment seats
The very holy gods, and discussed,
Who should form the lord of dwarfs,
Out of the blood of Brimir and the limbs of Bláin.
Containing as it does the adjective “blue,” the name might refer to the blue
sky. It is, however, also found in the thulur as a dwarf name.
See also Brimir
BÖLTHOR(N)
Father or grandfather of Bestla, Odin’s giant mother.
The form “Bölthor” is found in Hávamál, stanza 140, where he is referred to as
the father of Bestla and of a famous but unnamed son, from whom Odin got or
learned nine magic songs. The form “Bölthorn” is found in Snorri, who says that
Odin married that woman who was called Bestla, the daughter of Bölthorn. The
difference in name forms does not appear to be significant, but Bölthorn obvi
ously means “Evil-thorn,” whereas the form “Bölthor” would not have had an
obvious meaning to a Viking or medieval Scandinavian.
A special relationship with the maternal uncle is mentioned by Tacitus and
is found in Norse texts and a proverb from medieval Iceland: “Men turn out
most like their maternal uncles.” Certainly Odin, of all the gods, turned out
most like a giant.
See also Bestla, Odin
BOUND MONSTER
Enemy of the gods bound or restrained in some way during the mythological present
but destined to break free at Ragnarök.
82 Norse Mythology



The monster who best fits the pattern is the wolf Fenrir, whose sole function in
the mythology is to be bound by the gods and then to break free at Ragnarök and
wreak havoc: to swallow the sun according to Vafthrúdnismál and to kill Odin
according to Völuspá. Fenrir was bound with a magic fetter and bit off Ty ́r’s
hand, which was placed in his mouth as a pledge that the binding was in sport.
Fenrir may be identical with Garm, who according to a refrain in Völuspá howls
before the cave Gnipahellir: “The bond will burst, / and the wolf run free.”
Fenrir was the son of Loki and the giantess Angrboda, one of a brood of
three. In light of the binding of Fenrir, we may be justified in regarding the exile
of his siblings—the Midgard serpent to the outer waters of the sea and Hel to the
world of the dead—as a kind of binding. No fetters are used, but the serpent does
lied coiled about the earth, biting its own tail, and this linking of mouth to tail
might be taken as a kind of binding. Like Fenrir, the Midgard serpent will be
“unbound” from the ocean at Ragnarök and will kill Thor. There is no parallel
“unbinding” for Hel, however.
Loki is the most important and studied of the bound monsters in Scandina
vian mythology. His binding occurs, according to Snorri, as vengeance for the
killing of Baldr. According to the prose colophon to Lokasenna, however, Loki
was bound as vengeance for his reviling of the gods at the feast of Ægir. Loki’s
binding is more uncomfortable than that of his monster children, however, for a
snake hangs over his head dripping venom. His wife Sigyn collects the venom in
a bowl, but when she goes to empty the bowl Loki writhes in anguish and shakes
the earth, “and that is now called earthquakes,” as the passage following
Lokasenna puts it. Loki of course gets free at Ragnarök and according to Völuspá
will steer a ship full of the forces of evil against the gods. Snorri also grants him
a mutually fatal single combat with Heimdall.
Since the early twentieth century, and especially through the influential
study of Ragnarök by Axel Olrik, Loki as bound monster has been associated
with similar figures from traditions of people living in the Caucasus. However,
at least Fenrir and Garm are also clearly bound monsters, and the notion of
bound forces of evil who will break free at Ragnarök could be extended to nearly
all the forces who will assail the gods at that time. If we are to take seriously the
notion of a loan from the Caucasus, it would affect nearly the entire mythology.
And of course there was the analog within Christian legend of the bound
Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment.

BOUS
Avenger of Baldr in the version of the story in Saxo’s Gesta Danorum.
Bous was the result of Othinus’s rape of the Rutenian princess Rinda. He grows
up skilled with weapons, and when he is ten, Odin summons him and argues
that vengeance is more noble than killing random adversaries. When Bous and
Høtherus (in Saxo’s version, Balderus’s competitor for the affections of Nanna)
meet in battle, Bous kills Høtherus but himself receives a mortal wound; he dies
the next day. Thus Bous differs from Váli, the avenger of Baldr in the vernacular
west Scandinavian traditions, not just in his name, for Váli survives not only the
encounter with Höd but also, and far more significantly, the cataclysmic demise
of gods, giants, and the cosmos that is Ragnarök. Váli is truly an enduring figure,
but Bous is a very minor player in Saxo’s history.
The name Bous is ordinarily understood to represent a Danish version of the
medieval Icelandic name Búi, and since the name is ultimately related to the
verb meaning “to dwell, settle,” earlier scholars associated it with their theories
of fertility myth and ritual associated with Baldr’s death. But “Búi” was an ordi
nary man’s name, and indeed was not infrequently used in heroic legend: One of
the most famous of the Jómsvíkingar, for example, was Búi the Stout, and a Búi
also turns up among the sons of Karl in Rígsthula.

BRACTEATES
Small round golden disks, stamped with images on one side and occasionally also
with runic inscriptions.
Bracteates date from the late Migration Period (5th–6th centuries C.E.) and have
been found in graves and hoards and as isolated finds. They were probably intended
84 Norse Mythology



to be worn as pendants hanging around the neck. More than 900 bracteates exist,
mostly from Scandinavia but also from England and the Continent.
Bracteates are significant for the study of Norse mythology not for the runic
inscriptions but for the human and animal images on them. These were based
on Roman iconography, but they soon developed characteristic Germanic forms
that some scholars have thought involved especially the god Odin. In a huge
body of work, Karl Hauck argued that the bracteates present a “wind-god” who
is involved with healing, and specifically that certain bracteates containing this
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 85

and swastika. (Universitets Oldsaksamling, Oslo)



figure and that of an animal show Odin healing Baldr’s horse, as he does in the
Second Merseburg Charm. He interprets another characteristic image, that of
three figures together (the so-called three-god bracteates) as presenting Odin,
Baldr, and Loki, or perhaps Odin, Baldr, and Hel, either of which would corre
spond to the Baldr myth as we have it in the Scandinavian sources. In addition,
the divine twins have been identified in images with two figures. Although
Hauck’s work is enormously learned and thorough, the mythological interpreta
tions remain speculative and would seem to invite fresh investigations.
See also Baldr; Hel; Loki; Merseburg Charms; Odin References and further reading: Karl Hauck provided a relatively short summary of his analyses in the encyclopedia article “Brakteatenikonlogie,” Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, ed.

(Munich: W. Fink, 1985–1989). A recent work reassessing Hauck’s thinking is Kathryn Starkey, “Imagining an Early Odin: Gold Bracteates as Visual Evidence?” Scandinavian Studies 71 (1999): 373–392.
BRAGI
God of poetry according to Snorri Sturluson; perhaps identical with Bragi Boddason
the Old, traditionally reckoned the first skald.
Bragi is listed fourth in Snorri’s catalog of the æsir in Gylfaginning:
One is called Bragi. He is excellent with respect to wisdom and foremost in lin
guistic genius and speech. He knows most about poetry, and because of him
bragr is called poetry, and from his name that one is called a bragr of men or a
bragr of women who possesses verbal talent beyond others, a man or a woman.
His wife is Idun.
Snorri has no more to say of Bragi in Gylfaginning, but he used Bragi exten
sively in Skáldskaparmál. This usage occurs in the frame. Ægir has come to visit
the æsir, and at the splendid banquet that ensues he is seated next to Bragi, who
tells him “many tidings about the æsir.” These are the mythic narratives of
Skáldskaparmál, and many are told in the context of a dialogue between Ægir
and Bragi that precisely parallels the one between Gylfi/Gangleri and Hár, Jafn
hár, and Thridi in Gylfaginning.
86 Norse Mythology



Grímnismál, stanza 44, calls Bragi “best of poets” in a list of other “bests”
Odin of the æsir, Sleipnir of horses, and so forth. In Lokasenna, Bragi has an early
exchange with Loki. Loki has just joined the æsir after calling on his blood
brother relationship with Odin, and Vídar has poured him a drink.
11. [Loki:] Hail æsir, hail ásynjur
and all the very holy gods,
except that one áss, who sits further in,
Bragi, on the bench.
12. [Bragi:] Steed and sword will I give you of my riches,
and Bragi will thus fix it for you with a ring;
lest you repay jealousy to the gods;
do not provoke the gods to anger at you.
13. [Loki:] Horse and arm rings will you ever
lack both, Bragi;
of æsir and elves who are in here
you are the most wary of battle
and most shy of a shot.
14. [Bragi:] I know that if I were outside, as I am inside
come into Ægir’s hall,
your head I would carry in my hands
I see that for your lying.
15. [Loki:] You are brave in your seat, you will never do thus,
Bragi, you adornment of the bench.
Go your way, if you are angry
You seem not brave at all.
Bragi’s cowardice is not elsewhere mentioned, and in fact this accusation is
common in Lokasenna.
Bragi is found at Valhöll in both Hákonarmál (stanza 14) and Eiríksmál
(stanza 3). Each of these late-tenth-century poems shows the arrival of a human
king at Valhöll, and it is not inconceivable that the poets imagined Bragi Bodda
son the poet there as an earlier arrival from the world of humans. If this was
indeed the source of Bragi the god, it had to have preceded the stanzas from
Grímnismál and Lokasenna, and this level of relative chronology eludes us.
References and further reading: Two of the giants of the nineteenth century debated the question of Bragi the poet and Bragi the god. Eugen Mogk, “Bragi als Gott und Dichter,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur 12 (1887): 383–392, derived the god from the poet and thought that Bragi’s promotion to Valhöll had occurred as early as the late ninth century. Opposition came from Sophus Bugge, “Der Gott Bragi in den norrönen
Gedichten,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur 13
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 87



(1888): 187–201, who thought that time frame for the process was too short. Mogk had the last word: “Bragi,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur 14 (1889): 81–90.
BREIDABLIK
Baldr’s dwelling, according to Grímnismál, stanza 12, and Snorri in Gylfaginning.
Interpreting the verse, which says that fewest evils are at Breidablik, Snorri says
that nothing impure is there, and he surely had in mind Baldr’s “goodness” when
he said this. The name means either “wide-gleam” or “wide-view.”
See also Baldr
BRIMIR
In Völuspá, stanza 9, apparently an alternate name for Ymir:
Then all the powers went to their judgment seats
The very holy gods, and discussed,
Who should form the lord of dwarfs,
Out of the blood of Brimir and the limbs of Bláin.
Containing as it does the word brim, “surf, seaway,” the name might allude
to the making of the sea from Ymir’s blood. It is also found in Völuspá, stanza
37, where it appears to refer to a beer hall of the giants, although it is not wholly
impossible that it refers to the owner of the beer hall. This hall stands at (or is
named, if Brimir owns it) Ókólnir (Uncold).
See also Bláin
BRÍSINGA MEN
Torque or necklace belonging to Freyja.
In eddic poetry, the Brísinga men is found in Thrymskvida. It jerks when Freyja
is angered at the suggestion that she should go to Giantland (stanza 13), and at
Heimdall’s suggestion (stanza 15), it is put onto Thor as he assumed Freyja’s dis
guise (stanza 19). Otherwise the Brísinga men is found only in Snorri’s Edda. In
both Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál, Snorri says simply that Freyja owned it,
but in Skáldskaparmál he also gives two very interesting pieces of information:
Loki and Heimdall fought over it, and Loki is known as the “thief of the giants,
of the goat, of the Brísinga men, and of the apples of Idun.” A battle between
Heimdall and Loki is known from one stanza of the late-tenth-century Icelandic
skaldic poem Húsdrápa by Úlf Uggason. It is difficult to interpret, but some
88 Norse Mythology



scholars think they may indeed have been fighting over the Brísinga men. In
stanza 9 of the Haustlöng of Thjódólf of Hvin, one of the very earliest skaldic
poems, Loki is called “hoop-thief of Brísing’s people,” an apparent reference to
his theft of the necklace. The same myth also appears to be recounted in the late
Sörla tháttr, in which Loki, taking on the form of a fly, steals from Freyja a
golden necklace made for her by dwarfs, but the necklace is not explicitly called
the Brísinga men.
Lines 1197–1201 of the Old English epic Beowulf allude to a legendary nar
rative in which the hero Hama takes away the necklace of the Brosings (Brosinga
mene), fleeing the terror of Ermaneric. This necklace is clearly an analog of the
Brísinga men, and many scholars have tried to relate the story attached to it to
Loki’s battle with Heimdall or theft of the necklace, an enterprise that is not
easy. What the Beowulf analog does seem to show is that Brísinga men should
be understood as “torque of the Brísings,” not, as some scholars have thought,
“gleaming torque” or “sunny torque.” But who the Brísings might be remains an
unanswered question. The Brísing of Haustlöng is not found elsewhere, although
the thulur refer to a Norwegian island of that name. The simplest explanation
might be to regard the Brísings as dwarfs, the ones who, according to Sörla
tháttr, made Freyja’s precious necklace.
References and further reading: Perhaps the most famous treatment of the Brísinga men is an essay by Karl Müllenhoff, “Frija und der Halsbandmythus,” Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertumn 30 (1886): 217–260, which argues for a
kind of solar myth that, as F. Klaeber put it, “compels admiration rather than acceptance” (Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg: Edited with Introduction, Bibliography, Notes, Glossary, and Appendices, 3rd ed., with first and second supplements [Boston: D. C. Heath, 1950], 178). The archaeological background is explored by Birgit Arrhenius, “Det flammande smycket,” Fornvännen 57 (1962): 79–101, and “Zum symbolischen Sinn des Almadin im früheren Mittelalter,” Frühmittelalterliche Studien 3 (1969): 47–59. The parallel between Brosinge mene and Brísinga men is treated by Ursula Dronke, “Beowulf and Ragnar  ̧ok,” Saga-Book of the Viking Society 17 (1968): 302–325, and Helen Damico, “Sörlaπáttr and the Hama Episode in Beowulf,” Scandinavian Studies 55 (1983): 222–235.
BROKK
Dwarf; helped create some of the precious objects of the gods.
Snorri tells the story in Skáldskaparmál. Loki had cut the hair off Sif, Thor’s
wife, and he avoided a beating only by promising to have the dwarfs make for Sif
a headpiece that would grow into golden hair. After having the sons of Ívaldi
make the headpiece and also the ship Skídbladnir and Odin’s spear, Gungnir, he
bets the dwarf Brokk that Brokk’s brother Eitri cannot make three equally good
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 89



objects. Brokk is to work the bellows for Eitri, and Loki changes himself into a
fly and pesters Brokk. Eitri makes first a boar with gold bristles, then the ring
Draupnir, finally Mjöllnir, Thor’s hammer. The hammer’s handle is short
because Brokk’s bellows work was nearly interrupted when the fly bit him
between the eyes so that blood flowed.
Brokk is known from no other source.

BUR, BOR (SON)
Son of Búri, father of Odin, Vili, and Vé.
Bur is found in eddic poetry and in Snorri’s Edda, where the name is spelled Bor.
The word bur is a poetic noun meaning “son.” With the giantess Bestla, Bur had
the three sons Odin, Vili, and Vé.
See also Bestla; Búri; Odin
BÚRI
First of the æsir, father of Bur and therefore grandfather of Odin.
Búri is found in Snorri’s Gylfaginning but not in eddic poetry. He is part of the
creation story, for he was licked from salt blocks by the primeval cow Aud
humla. Snorri describes him as “fair in appearance, large, and powerful. He begat
that son called Bor.” Although the text does not make it explicit, we may, I
think, assume that he did so through an ordinary human sexual act, in contrast
to the monstrous hermaphroditic procreation of Ymir.
See also Audhumla; Bur, Bor; Ymir
BYGGVIR
Mythological character.
Byggvir is found only in the prose header to Lokasenna and stanzas 55–56 of the
poem. The prose header says that he and Beyla were servants of Frey. Byggvir’s
intervention with Loki in the poem proper follows that of Frey. In stanza 43
Byggvir apparently says (the stanza is difficult) that if he could measure up to
Frey, he would give Loki a beating, the evil crow! Loki’s response is dismissive:
“What is that little thing, / I see strutting about, / a hungry parasite? / At the
ears of Frey / you will always be / and will cluck under the millstone” (stanza
45). Byggvir responds by proclaiming his name and stating that all men and gods
call him rapid: “I am proud here / that the sons of Hropt [i.e., of Odin] / all drink
beer together.” Loki responds: “Shut up, Byggvir! / You were never able / to
90 Norse Mythology



divide food among people. / And in the straw of the floor / you were never seen
/ when people fought.”
Like his wife Beyla (according to Lokasenna stanza 56), Byggvir is mostly
understood through the etymology of his name, although the problem is com
plicated by the competing form in the poem, “Beyggvir.” Bygg is the word for
barley, and much of what the poem says of Byggvir can be imagined to fit barley,
which is tiny, ground in a mill, and used in beer. Barley would be associated with
Frey insofar as Frey is a fertility god.
If Byggvir is indeed a personification of barley, he is virtually unique in
Scandinavian mythology, which otherwise has little to say of such figures.
See also Beyla

Einar Haugen, Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology, 3 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973), 89–117, surveys the evidence.
BYLEIST (BYLEIPT, BYLEIFT)
Loki’s brother.
Although he acts in no extant myth, Byleist is found in a number of passages in
poetry in the kenning “Byleist’s brother” for Loki. Snorri states directly in both
Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál that Byleist is one of Loki’s two brothers; the
other is Helblindi.
Unlike Helblindi, whose meaning is transparent (Hel-blind), Byleist’s name
is obscure. Most attempts at etymology have come up with some sort of mete
orological phenomenon, which is hardly helpful.
See also Loki
DAG (DAY)
Personification of the day.
Dag is found in Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 25, Vafthrúdnir’s response to Odin’s
question in stanza 24, “Whence comes the day / that goes over people / or the
night with tides?”
Delling he is called, he is Dag’s father,
And Nótt [Night] was born to Nör.
New moon and tides the useful powers created
For people to tell time.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 91



An alternate translation of the second half of the first line would be “he is
father of the day.”
In Gylfaginning Snorri has an interesting expansion of the idea in this stanza:
Nörfi or Narfi was a giant who lived in Jötunheimar. He had a daughter named
Nótt [Night]; she was swarthy and dark, as she had the lineage for. [She had two
marriages, to Naglfari, then to Ánar.] Last she married Delling, and he was of
the lineage of the æsir. Their son was Dag, according to his paternal heritage.
This is a typical example of Snorri’s view of the mythological difference
between jötnar and æsir. But it also shows the importance in the mythology of
patriliny, which in medieval Iceland operated within a bilateral kinship system;
that is, people could reckon their kin through father and mother (and we might
expect that they thought they inherited characteristics of both, not just of the
father). As in the genealogy of the æsir as a whole, so it is with the heavenly bod
ies. Dag and Odin each has a giant mother (Nótt, Bestla) and ultimately a giant
progenitor on the mother’s side (Ymir, Nörfi), but each is regarded exclusively as
a member of the æsir.
Snorri goes on in Gylfaginning to say that Alfödr gave Dag and Nótt each a
horse and carriage and put them up in the sky, where they go around the earth
once a day. “The horse that Dag has is called Skínfaxi, and all the sky and earth
glow from its mane.”
See also Delling; Nótt; Nari and/or Narfi
DÁIN (DEAD)
According to Grímnismál, stanza 33 (and therefore Snorri in Gylfaginning), one of
the four harts that gnaws on Yggdrasil; elsewhere an appropriate and much-used
dwarf name, except in Hávamál, stanza 143, where he appears to be an elf.
This last stanza lists various people who carve runes, and since Odin carves for the
æsir, the others presumably are of the race for which they carve, and Dáin carves
for the elves. Perhaps the name “Dead” was just very useful mythologically.
See also Dvalin; Yggdrasil
DELLING
Father of Dag, who is day personified.
Delling is found in Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 25, Vafthrúdnir’s response to Odin’s
question in stanza 24, “Whence comes the day / that goes over people / or the
night with tides?”
92 Norse Mythology



Delling he is called, he is Dag’s father,
And Nótt [Night] was born to Nör.
New moon and tides the useful powers created
For people to tell time.
An alternate translation of the second half of the first line would be “he is
father of the day.”
In Gylfaginning, Snorri has an interesting expansion of the idea in this stanza:
Nörfi or Narfi was a giant who lived in Jötunheimar. He had a daughter named
Nótt; she was swarthy and dark, as she had the lineage for. [She had two mar
riages.] Last she married Delling and he was of the lineage of the æsir. Their son
was Dag, according to his paternal heritage.
This is a typical example of Snorri’s view of the mythological difference
between jötnar and æsir. As I point out above, in the entry on Dag, it shows the
typical mythological emphasis on patriliny. Dag is of the æsir because his father
was of the æsir, even though his mother was not.
Delling probably means something like “shining,” which would be an
appropriate name for the father of the day. But the situation is complicated by
Hávamál, stanza 160, in which Odin is enumerating charms he has learned:
I know a fifteenth, which Thjódrörir howled,
The dwarf, before Delling’s door.
Unless Delling’s door is a metaphor for sunrise, there may have been two
figures called Delling, the second a dwarf, and Delling is indeed listed in the thu
lur as a dwarf name.

References and further reading: Rudolf Much, “Der germanische Himmelsgott,” in the volume Abhandlungen zur germanischen Philologie: Festgabe für
R. Heinzel (Halle an der Saale: M. Niemeyer, 1898), 189–278, argued, based on the etymological connection between Dell- and -dall, that Delling was a representation of Heimdall.
DÍSABLÓT
Sacrifice to the dísir.
From the point of view of the mythology the most interesting reference to the
dísablót is found in a version of Hervarar saga ok Heidreks konungs (The Saga
of Hervör and King Heidrek), which scholars ordinarily date to around the end of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 93



the thirteenth century, although the dating is difficult. This version of the saga
opens with an account of the Learned Prehistory and tells about Starkad
Áludreng. Starkad abducts Álfhild, the daughter of King Álf of Álfheimar, after
she has reddened the altar (hörgr) with blood at a great dísablót one autumn. The
prefix Álf- means “elf,” and although there is no other evidence connecting the
elves with the dísablót, on its face the text offers a mythological model for
human behavior. The ceremony takes place at the home of a king, is presided
over by a woman (one indeed of royal lineage), and involves the spilling of blood,
presumably from an animal that was sacrificed. Angered at the abduction of his
daughter, King Álf calls on Thor, who subsequently kills Starkad and restores
Álfhild to her father. It is at least conceivable that the author of the saga thought
that Thor was inclined to intervene because the dísablót had been successfully
carried out, in other words, that in the eyes of this author at least, a dísablót
could have been aimed at the æsir.
This ceremony is also mentioned in thirteenth-century Icelandic sources of
a more historical nature. Two set the ceremony in Viking Age Norway and the
other, Snorri’s Ynglinga saga, chapter 29, in Uppsala. Snorri says that at the dís
ablót, King Adils was riding around the dísarsal, “hall of the dís,” when his
horse stumbled and threw him. The king’s head struck a rock in such a way that
his skull was split and his brain spilled onto the rock, and that was his death.
Snorri then quotes Thjódólf of Hvin’s Ynglinga tal, which does not mention the
dísablót but says that a “creature of magic” or witch was to deprive Adils of his
life; the brave descendent of Frey was to fall from his horse and his brain to be
mixed with wet sand. Presumably Snorri understood the creature of magic as a
witch, and he may also have thought that the dísablót involved riding a horse
around a building sacred to or temporarily set aside for one of the dísir. Here the
connection of the dísir with death would be echoed. The story is told with less
detail in Historia Norvegiae.
The other two accounts come from the Sagas of Icelanders. Both set the dís
ablót at a banquet or feast in the midtenth century in Norway. Egils saga, which
is from the early part of the thirteenth century—perhaps, according to some,
from the pen of Snorri Sturluson—says that a feast was prepared at a farm owned
by King Eirík Bloodax and Queen Gunnhild and that on an evening when the
king and queen had just arrived, “there was to be a dísablót there.” The actual
account of the proceedings has to do pretty much exclusively with drinking huge
mugs of beer, but it includes a skaldic stanza by Egil alluding to the dísablót.
Víga-Glúms saga, which was composed a bit later than Egils saga and perhaps
with that saga in mind, says that Víga-Glúm comes to Voss, in western Norway,
and that a feast was prepared at the “winter-nights” (the onset of winter in late
October), and the dísablót was done.
94 Norse Mythology



Thus the dísablót appears to have had a connection with autumn and to
have been a relatively public event, insofar as it involved the participation of
royalty. Beyond that we know little. A dísathing (assembly of or for the dísir)
was held in Uppsala in early February, and there are many place-names attesting
to the worship of the dísir.
DÍSIR
Collective female spirits.
In the mythological sources proper the dísir are hardly to be found. Their only
secure appearance is in the eddic poem Grímnismál, stanza 53. Odin is about to
reveal his identity to the doomed Geirröd:
Slaughtered carrion
will Ygg [Odin] have now,
I know that your life has run its course;
angry are the dísir
now you may see Odin,
approach me, if you can!
The association with impending death seems to be a commonplace of the
usage of the term “dísir” in eddic poetry. In Reginsmál, stanza 24, Hnikar tells
Sigurd that there is great danger if he should trip going into battle: “Malicious
dísir / stand on both sides of you / and wish to see you wounded.” In Hamdis
mál, stanza 28, Hamdir, bemoaning the killing of their half-brother at their own
hands, tell Sörli that the dísir had incited them. Sometimes the dísir look like
valkyries, as in Atlamál, stanza 28, where Glaumvör tells her husband Gunnar
a disquieting dream:
I thought dead women
came hither into the hall,
not poorly decked out.
They wished to choose you,
would have invited you quickly
to their benches;
I declare of no value
these dísir to you.
These dísir who would choose a doomed warrior and invite him to their
benches look rather like valkyries, the choosers of the dead and the maidens who
serve them in Valhöll. And indeed, the expression “Herjann’s [Odin’s] dísir,”

which is found in Gudrúnarkvida I, stanza 19, looks like a kenning for the
valkyries, Odin’s maidens, but since the noun dís can also mean just “lady,” that
stanza may tell us nothing at all about the dísir.
Snorri uses the singular form, dís, in connection with two figures in
Gylfaginning. After recounting the story of the failed marriage between Njörd
and Skadi, Snorri says that Skadi moved to the mountains and lived at
Thrymhrim, “and she goes about much on skis and with a bow and shoots ani
mals; she is called ‘snow-shoe god’ or ‘snow-shoe dís.’ ” Snorri says later in
Gylfaginning that Freyja “is also called Vanadís,” that is, dís of the vanir.
The text in which dísir play the greatest role is Thidranda tháttr ok
Thórhalls, which is found in late-fourteenth-century manuscripts of the Great
Saga of Olaf Tryggvason but is believed by some observers to have been included
in the late-twelfth-century Latin life of Olaf Tryggvason, now lost, by the Ice
landic monk Gunnlaug Leifsson. It is set before the conversion of Iceland to
Christianity at the farmstead of Sídu-Hall, a leading chieftain who later was to
be among those who advanced the cause of the conversion. The prophet Thorhall
has foreseen that a prophet is to die at the sacrifice of the winter nights, but Sídu
Hall has a bull named Prophet slaughtered. Thorhall then decrees that none
should leave the house at night, but when there are three mighty knocks on the

Figures found all over Scandinavia are believed to represent valkyries or dísir. (The Art

door, Sídu-Hall’s son Thidrandi opens it and goes outside. He is attacked by nine
women in black riding from the north, while nine women in white ride from the
south. Thorhall later guesses that there will be a change of religion for the bet
ter. The women were fylgjur (fetches) of Sídu-Hall’s family. The nine women in
black were dísir who wanted their share before being forever parted from the
family, while the nine in white were dísir who arrived too late to help.
Many interpretations of these strange women and the events in which they
figure have been advanced. Some scholars argue that Sídu-Hall angered the dísir
by failing to hold the dísablót (sacrifice to the dísir), but there is no evidence for
that in the text. What the text does tell us unequivocally is that some time
between the late twelfth and late fourteenth centuries a learned author saw little
difference between fylgjur and dísir and saw no difficulty depicting them in
terms of color symbolism to represent the opposition between the old faith and
the new. The destructive and benign nature of the two groups reminds us further
of the good and bad fates doled out by valkyries. Once again the distinction
among these groups of collective female spirits breaks down.
Another connection with the conversion is the nickname of the poet Thor
björn dísarskáld (Skald of the dís), who is one of two poets who left fragments of
poetry directly addressed to Thor.
Place-names suggest a cult of the dísir, and written sources tell of a sacrifice
to the dísir, the dísablót.

DRAUPNIR (DRIPPER)
Odin’s golden arm ring.
Many skalds use “Draupnir” in kennings for gold, so it must have been well
known, although the only Draupnir to be found in eddic poetry by name is a
dwarf in the catalog of dwarfs in Völuspá. However, in Skírnismál, stanza 21,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 97



Skírnir offers Gerd a ring that had been burned with Odin’s young son, from
which drip every ninth night eight rings of equal weight. This can only be Draup
nir, for in Gylfaginning Snorri says that Odin put the ring Draupnir on Baldr’s
funeral pyre and adds the information about its magically replicating itself, infor
mation that he also includes in Skáldskaparmál when he tells of the origin of
Draupnir. Like Sif’s golden hair, Frey’s ship Skídbladnir, Odin’s spear Gungnir,
Frey’s golden boar, and Thor’s hammer, it was made by the dwarfs. Along with
the boar and the hammer, Draupnir is one of three treasures forged by Eitri while
Loki in the form of a fly pestered Brokk, who was working the bellows.
Draupnir has truly been to Hel and back, for Snorri says, in his account of
Baldr’s death, that when Hermód leaves the realm of the dead after having
acquired Hel’s consent to release Baldr if all creation will weep, he takes with
him Draupnir, sent by Baldr to Odin as a memorial. Indeed, Skáldskaparmál lists
among Baldr kennings “owner of Draupnir,” and the passage of Draupnir through
funeral fire and the world of the dead must truly have enhanced its value.

DVALIN (DELAYED)
Dwarf name; also according to Grímnismál, stanza 33 (and therefore Snorri in
Gylfaginning), one of the four harts that gnaws on Yggdrasil.
Dvalin is mentioned in stanza 11 of Völuspá in the catalog of dwarfs, then again
in stanza 17, as the catalog of dwarfs is drawing to a close, when the “dwarfs in
98 Norse Mythology



Dvalin’s group” are mentioned. In stanza 145 of Hávamál, Dvalin stands as a
representative of the dwarfs, along with Odin for the æsir, Dáin for the elves, and
Alsvinn for the giants. According to stanza 16 of Alvíssmál, the dwarfs call the
sun “Dvalin’s deluder” (or so the expression is understood, as a reference to the
sun turning dwarfs to stone). When, then, Fáfnismál, stanza 13, says that some
of the norns are of the family of the æsir, some are of the elves, and some are the
daughters of Dvalin, it seems apparent that the dwarfs are what is meant. The
skalds often used “Dvalin’s drink” or something similar as a kenning for poetry,
clearly because the mead of poetry had at one time been in the possession of
dwarfs. Finally, Dvalin is the name of one of the dwarfs to whom Freyja gave her
self in Sörla tháttr in exchange for a golden necklace, presumably the Brísinga
men. Dvalin is, then, one of the most common of the dwarf names. Why he
should be “delayed” is not clear.
As for the hart, the thulur list “Dvalar” as a hart name, but not “Dvalin,”
and some observers think that the hart who gnaws at Yggdrasil should be Dvalar.

DWARFS
Mythological beings.
Völuspá turns its attention to the dwarfs just after the æsir have created the cos
mos, arranged for time reckoning, and acquired gold. The æsir were blissful
“until three came, / giant maidens, / very powerful, / out of Jötunheimar”
(stanza 8). For the first of several times in the poem, when crisis threatens, the
gods repair to their “judgment seats.” On this occasion they consider “which
dwarfs are to create a lord” (Codex Regius) or “who is to create troops of dwarfs”
(Hauksbók) “out of bloody surf and out of dark limbs” (Codex Regius). The pas
sage is difficult, and the editions ordinarily render it as something like “who
should create a lord of dwarfs out of the blood of Brimir and out of the limbs of
Bláin.” The following stanza, however, is clear:
There Mótsognir had
become the foremost
of all dwarfs,
and Durinn the second;
human likenesses they
made many, those dwarfs, out of earth,
as Durinn told.
There follows a catalog of dwarfs that takes up several stanzas. Thus
Völuspá actually has more information on dwarfs than on the gods. The names
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 99



in this and other catalogs of dwarfs suggest something about their characteris
tics: They are associated with the dead, with battle, with wisdom, with crafts
manship, with the supernatural, and even to some extent with the elves.
It is not clear why the arrival of giant maidens in Völuspá should provoke a
crisis involving the dwarfs. However, the response appears to have something to
do with the creation of order in the already existing community of dwarfs, or the
creation of troops of dwarfs themselves. What these dwarfs do is to create
“human likenesses,” and it is not implausible that these are the human beings
whom the æsir will endow with the characteristics of life. Perhaps the arrival of
giant maidens made it clear that humans would be needed, since dead human
warriors make up the ranks of the einherjar who will fight alongside Odin
against the forces of chaos.
Certainly the fashioning of “human likenesses” is consistent with the gen
eral picture in the mythology of dwarfs as craftsmen. According to Snorri in
Skáldskaparmál, the dwarfs Fjalar and Galar made the mead of poetry out of the
blood of Kvasir. Mostly, however, the dwarfs make objects. Snorri also tells in
Skáldskaparmál of the creation of some of the most important and precious pos
sessions of the gods. Loki had cut the hair off Sif, Thor’s wife, and Loki avoided a
beating only by promising to have the dwarfs make for Sif a headpiece that would
grow into golden hair. He has the sons of Ívaldi make the headpiece, and also the
ship Skídbladnir and Odin’s spear, Gungnir. Then he bets the dwarf Brokk that
Brokk’s brother Eitri cannot make three equally good objects. Brokk is to work
the bellows for Eitri, and Loki changes himself into a fly and pesters Brokk. Eitri
makes first a boar with gold bristles, then the ring Draupnir, and finally Mjöllnir,
Thor’s hammer. The hammer’s handle is short because Brokk’s bellows work was
nearly interrupted when the fly bit him between the eyes so that blood flowed.
Thus, if we assign Sif’s hair to the realm of Thor, each of the three major
gods gets two objects. Odin gets his spear, which he can use to throw an enemy
army into panic, and the ring that duplicates itself in multiple copies. Thor gets
the hammer with which he kills giants, and Frey gets the ship that can be folded
up and put in a pocket and the gold-bristled boar, Gullinborsti. It may be worth
noting that each god gets one object of gold and one of iron or wood. Further
more, Odin commissioned the dwarfs to make the fetter Gleipnir, which he used
to bind Fenrir. And when Odin, Hœnir, and Loki needed gold to compensate
Hreidmar for the death of his son Otr in Skáldskaparmál, it was to the dwarfs
that Odin sent Loki. Like the male gods, Freyja also had precious objects fash
ioned by the dwarfs: She had her own gold-bristled boar (Hyndluljód, stanza 7)
and obtained a necklace (Sörla tháttr, which is probably a rather late text), per
haps the Brísinga men. Besides making precious objects for the gods, the dwarfs
may also have supported them with magic. According to Hávamál, stanza 160,
100 Norse Mythology



Odin learned a charm first sung by the dwarf Thjódrörir: “[H]e sang wealth for
the æsir, / and prosperity for the elves, / mind for Hroptaty ́r.” Hroptaty ́r is Odin,
and to have endowed him with mind would be a great gift.
However, in the overall scheme of Scandinavian mythology, the dwarfs
appear to occupy a position closer to that of the giants than to some kind of allies
of the gods. The flow of goods is always from the dwarfs to the gods, never the
reverse, and sometimes hostilities are involved, as when Loki gets gold from And
vari to compensate Hreidmar for the death of Otr. Alvíss wishes to marry Thor’s
daughter and winds up dead for this presumption (Alvíssmál), just as did the
giants Thrym and Thjazi, who coveted Freyja and Idun (Freyja did, however, appar
ently sleep with some dwarfs to get her necklace in Sörla tháttr). The poet
Thjódólf of Hvin said in his Ynglinga tal (stanza 5) that a dwarf tricked the
Swedish king Sveigdir, when the king jumped into the rock after the dwarf, and
“the bright hall of Sökmímir and his people, inhabited by giants [jötnar], gaped
open.” Paraphrasing the poem in Ynglinga saga, Snorri tells us that the king
Sveigdir one evening after sundown at a farm called Steinn (Stone) saw a dwarf sit
ting by the stone and was summoned into the stone by the dwarf, never to return.
The conception of dwarfs as dwelling in the earth or in rocks or mountains
is deeply rooted. Alvíss tells Thor that he lives down under the earth, under a
stone. When Odin sent for the fetter Gleipnir, the direction was down. Here,
however, and in Skáldskaparmál as well, in the story of the acquisition of gold
from Andvari, Snorri calls the destination Svartálfaheim (world of the black
elves), which suggests that for him the category of elves and dwarfs was some
what blurred.
Snorri tells us in Gylfaginning that the dwarfs originated as maggots in the
flesh of the proto-giant Ymir, whose body the gods used to fashion the cosmos.
Snorri also gives dwarfs a cosmological function and equates them with the car
dinal directions when he writes that the dwarfs Nordri (North), Sudri (South),
Austri (East), and Vestri (West) hold up the sky.
In later medieval Icelandic literature dwarfs appear as stereotypical figures
similar to those in medieval literature elsewhere in Europe.

EGGTHÉR
In Völuspá, stanza 42, the herdsman of a giantess:
He sat there on a mound and played a harp,
The herdsman of a giantess, happy Eggthér.
The giantess in question might be the one from stanza 40, who raised the
brood of Fenrir in Járnvid (Iron-woods), possibly therefore Angrboda. Why any
one working for her would be happy is unexplained; perhaps Eggthér was espe
cially fond of the harp. In any case, his name is identical to that of Ecgtheow,
who in the Old English epic Beowulf is the father of Beowulf. Andy Orchard, in
his Dictionary of Norse Myth and Legend, says that this parallel “is almost cer
tainly a red herring,” a statement with which I agree.

EGIL
According to Hymiskvida, stanza 7, the one who looked after Thor’s goats while
Thor was visiting Hymir; possibly the father of Thor’s human servants Thjálfi and
Röskva.
The surmise concerning Thjálfi and Röskva is based on Hymiskvida, stanza 37,
the third from last stanza in the poem and the one that follows Thor’s acquisi
tion of the kettle and killing of the pursuing giants. Parts of it are difficult, espe
cially in the third line, but it means something like this:
They went for a long time, before lay down
Hlorridi’s [Thor’s] goat, half dead, in front;
The team-mate of the trace was limping on its leg;
And the crafty Loki caused it.
According to Gylfaginning, when Thor and Loki set off on the visit to Jötun
heimar that would take them to Útgarda-Loki, they stopped for the night at a
farmer’s house. Thor killed and cooked his goats and then revived them next
morning. One was lame, because Thjálfi had broken it to get at the marrow.
Those who are able to put aside the different destinations of the two trips and
the differing roles of Loki (he did not accompany Thor in Hymiskvida, and he
was not responsible for the laming in Gylfaginning) and who like to sew things
up neatly will find attractive the possibility of linking Egil to Thjálfi and Röskva.

EIKTHYRNIR (OAK-ENCIRCLER)
Hart that nibbles on the leaves of Yggdrasil, the world tree.
The major source is Grímnismál, stanza 26:
Eikthyrnir is the name of a hart, who stands at the hall of Herjafödr [Odin]
And bites from the limbs of Lærad.
Yet from his horns it drips into Hvergelmir,
Thence all waters have their ways.
In Gylfaginning, Snorri paraphrases this stanza nearly verbatim, at least for
the first half, but he clarifies the last line to mean a bunch of rivers, which he
names.
See also Lærad; Yggdrasil References and further reading: The high water mark for Eikthyrnir studies (and also the only year in which anything significant has ever appeared) was 1917: Axel Olrik, “Yggdrasil,” Danske studier 14 (1917): 49–62, used the confluence of oak tree and large stag to assign the provenance of Yggdrasil to Denmark or western Norway. Uno Holmberg (Harva), “Valhall och världsträdet,” Finsk tidskrift för vitterhet, vetenskap, konst och politik 48 (1917): 349–377,
thought that Eikthyrnir was an Icelandic invention based on the constellation Ursa Major.
EIN(D)RIDI (LONE-RIDER)
Thor name.
The name is found in stanza 19 of the Haustlöng of Thjódólf of Hvin, one of the
very earliest skalds, in the scene in Thor’s duel with Hrungnir in which the
whetstone is lodged in the god’s head. Elsewhere in this stanza Einridi is called
both earth’s son and Odin’s son. It is also found in the Vellekla of Einar Helga
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 103



son skálaglamm, a poem in praise of Hákon the Hladir jarl, probably from around
975–985 C.E. In this stanza he refers to the temple lands of Einridi and all the
gods (bönd).
The form with d in the second syllable is younger. My translation of the
name (either form) is what I think a Norseman would have thought it meant;
some scholars have thought that etymologically it may originally have meant
“lone ruler.” It is worth noting that this name is attested on rune stones for
human beings, who may therefore have been named after the god.

EINHERJAR (LONE-FIGHTERS)
The chosen warriors of Odin, who sport at Valhöll awaiting the last battle at
Ragnarök.
Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 41, describes life at Valhöll:
All the einherjar in Odin’s fields
Hack each other each day.
They choose slaughter and ride from the field
Later sit reconciled together.
Grímnismál, stanza 18, says that the einherjar are nourished on Sæhrímnir,
cooked in Eldhrímnir by Andhrímnir. Stanza 23 says that 800 einherjar go out of
each of the doors of Valhöll. Stanza 36 lists the valkyries who bring beer to them.
At the end of the poem, when Odin reveals his identity to Geirröd, Odin tells
him that he has lost the grace of all the einherjar and of Odin.
The anonymous Eiríksmál, from the second half of the tenth century,
describes Valhöll and puts the einherjar there. Indeed, stanza 1 has Odin dream
that he awakened the einherjar and bade them prepare for an honored guest. The
similar poem Hákonarmál, attributed to Eyvind Finnsson skáldaspillir, also
mentions the einherjar: Odin tells the retinue of Hákon the Good, as they are
arriving in Valhöll, that they shall have a truce with the einherjar and invites
them to drink beer.
In Gylfaginning Snorri uses and expands on these sources, adding, among
other things, that the einherjar are “all those men who have fallen in battle since
the beginning of the world.” He also sends the einherjar out against the forces of
chaos at the last battle but gives no details of their fights and fates.
The emphasis in the sources is twofold: the eternal fighting and revival of
the einherjar, and their special relationship with Odin, which is manifested in
part by their feasting endlessly with him and in part by their sharing in his grace.
104 Norse Mythology



Many scholars think there may be a basis for the myth in an ancient Odin cult,
which would have centered on young warriors who entered into an ecstatic rela
tionship with Odin. Sometimes this notion is juxtaposed to the description in
the Germania of Tacitus, chapter 43, of an army of the dead. The people are
called the Harii, a name that some say is etymologically related to -herjar in ein
herjar. In Lokasenna, stanza 60, Loki addresses Thor as einheri, the singular of
einherjar and the only time the singular is attested. Thor certainly has a special
relationship with Odin, as his son with Jörd.
See also Andhrímnir; Eldhrímnir; Odin; Sæhrímnir; Valhöll References and further reading: The notion of an ecstatic Odin cult was best articulated by Otto Höfler, Kultische Geheimbünde der Germanen (Frankfurt: M. Diesterweg, 1934) and numerous later works. A more recent take is that of
Bruce Lincoln, articulated in his Priests, Warriors, and Cattle: A Study in the Ecology of Religions (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1981), 122–133. A credible alternative etymology of einherjar, proposing that the word meant “peerless warriors,” is in Lennart Elmevik, “Fisl. einherjar ‘krigare i Valhall’ och några andra fornnord. sammansättningar med -ein,” Saga och sed, 1982: 75–84.
EIR
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists Eir third in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the æsir
and calls her “best of physicians.” Her name is identical with the noun eir, “peace,
clemency.” Eir plays no role in the mythology, but in Fjölsvinnsmál, stanza 38,
Eir is found in a list of the maidens who serve Menglöd; none of the others is a
deity, and many are just feminine adjectives (“bright,” “happy,” “fair”). Eir is
listed among the names of valkyries in the thulur, but not among those of the god
desses. The name is common as a base word in skaldic kennings, but whether we
should trust Snorri and imagine the existence of a goddess Eir is problematic.
EIRÍKSMÁL
Anonymous poem composed after the death of King Eirík Bloodax at the battle of
Stainmoor, Westmoreland, England in 954, recounting his glorious arrival in Valhöll.
The poem as we have it is only nine stanzas, and two different meters are used.
Nevertheless, it appears to offer a picture of Valhöll that actually was rooted in
late paganism. The poem begins with Odin recounting a dream: He thought he
awoke early and bade the einherjar and valkyries prepare Valhöll for the arrival
of a great ruler. He asks Bragi what great noise resounds, as though Baldr him
self were returning to the hall. But it is Eirík Bloodax, and Odin bids the heroes
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 105



Sigmund and Sinfjötli arise and invite the guest into the hall, if it is Eirík. Bragi
asks why Odin thinks it is Eirík, and Odin responds that the guest has reddened
his sword in many a land. Why deprive such a great king of victory, asks Bragi.
Because, Odin answers, one can never know—the gray wolf gazes upon the
abodes of the gods. Eirík now arrives and is welcomed into the hall and asked
who accompanies him. Five kings, he says. Here the poem ends.
The mythological details are familiar: Einherjar and valkyries inhabit Val
höll, and Baldr is missing. Bragi here is presumably to be regarded as the human
poet, for the poem specifically mentions also the human heroes Sigmund and
Sinfjötli, and, of course, Eirík; the five kings who accompany him have not been
identified with any certainty. The poet explains why it is that a warrior favored
by Odin might be defeated in battle, and he implies that Ragnarök may be near,
or at least that in tenth-century Denmark Odin was consciously gathering troops
for the final battle.

References and further reading: The literary relationship between Eiríksmál and Hákonarmál is discussed by Klaus von See, “Zwei eddische Preislieder,” in
Festgabe Ulrich Pretzel zum 65. Geburtstag dargebracht von seinen Freunden und Schülern, ed. Walter Simon, Wolfgang Bachofer, and Wolfgang Dittmann (Berlin: Schmidt, 1963), 107–117. Edith Marold, “Das Walhallbild in den Eiríksmál und Hákonarmál,” Mediaeval Scandinavia 5 (1972): 19–33,
acknowledges that the portrait of Valhöll in Hákonarmál is darker and conceivably more archaic than that of Eiríksmál and analyzes especially the duality of the conceptions in Hákonarmál. Axel Seeberg treats the identity of those who accompany Eirík to Valhöll in “Five Kings,” Saga-Book of the Viking Society, 20 (1979–1980): 106–113.

EITRI
Dwarf; helped create some of the precious objects of the gods.
Snorri tells the story in Skáldskaparmál. Loki had cut the hair off Sif, Thor’s
wife, and he avoided a beating only by promising to have the dwarfs make for Sif
a headpiece that would grow into golden hair. After having the sons of Ívaldi
make the headpiece, and also the ship Skídbladnir and Odin’s spear, Gungnir, he
106 Norse Mythology



bets the dwarf Brokk that Brokk’s brother Eitri cannot make three equally good
objects. Brokk is to work the bellows for Eitri, and Loki changes himself into a
fly and pesters Brokk. Eitri makes first a boar with gold bristles, then the ring
Draupnir, finally Mjöllnir, Thor’s hammer. The hammer’s handle is short
because Brokk’s bellows work was interrupted when the fly bit him between the
eyes so that blood flowed.
Eitri is known from no other source.

ELDHRÍMNIR (FIRE-SOOTY)
Cookpot at Valhöll.
The key passage is stanza 18 of Grímnismál.
Andhrímnir in Eldhrímnir
Has Sæhrímnir boiled.
In Gylfaginning, Snorri understands the passage as a cook (Andhrímnir)
cooking pork (the pig Sæhrímnir) in a huge pot (Eldhrímnir), and indeed the rest
of this stanza seems to call Sæhrímnir the best of pork and refers to the myste
rious nourishment of the einherjar. All three of the names are joined by the ele
ment hrímnir, which is derived from the word for soot on a cookpot.
“Fire-sooty” as the cookpot is the most appropriate of the three.
See also Andhrímnir; Sæhrímnir
ELDIR
Servant of Ægir; Loki’s first verbal opponent in Lokasenna.
The prose header to Lokasenna says that people greatly praised Ægir’s two servants
(who cannot have had much to do, as the beer carried itself into the hall), and out
of jealousy Loki killed one of them, Fimafeng. After the gods chased him off to the
forest, Loki returned and confronted Eldir. Their exchange makes up the first five
stanzas of the poem. Loki asks what the æsir are discussing in the hall (stanza 1)
and Eldir replies that they are judging their weapons and prowess. No one, he says,
is a friend of Loki’s in words (has good things to say to or about Loki) (stanza 2).
Loki declares his intention to enter the hall and blend mead with harmful or sin
ister power (stanza 3). Stanzas 4–5 appear to be Eldir’s challenge to Loki, rebuffed:
4. [Eldir:] You know, if you enter Ægir’s hall,

This silences Eldir, and Loki enters the hall.
Eldir fits the character type of the outer guardian, often a herdsman as in
Skírnismál, stanzas 11–16, with whom someone contends before entering a
place for the main confrontation.

ÉLIVÁGAR (HAILSTORM-WAVES)
Mythic rivers, associated with the proto-giant Aurgelmir/Ymir or with the ends of the
world.
The association with the proto-giant is explicit in Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 31.
Odin has asked Vafthrúdnir whence came Aurgelmir, the oldest being according
to stanza 29, among the giants. Vafthrúdnir replies:
From the Élivágar spurted poison drops,
Thus it grew, until a giant emerged.
Snorri says that Aurgelmir is the name Ymir bore among the giants and
expands considerably on the above stanza, which must have been at least part of
his source. Hár is the speaker of this section, and he is responding to this ques
tion from Gylfi/Gangleri: “How was it arranged, before clans came into being or
mankind was increased?”
Those rivers which are called the Élivágar, when they had come so far from
their source that the fermentation that accompanied them there, hardened like
the slag that runs out of fires, as it was freezing, and when the ice stopped and
froze solid, and that drizzling rain that arose from the poison, froze into frost,
and the frost grew over all Ginnunga gap.
The discussion now turns to Ginnunga gap and Ymir’s eventual emergence
from it.
Most editors read “fermentation” as “poisonous yeast” to make the passage
accord better with Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 29. But there is still a substantial dif
ference between the two accounts, a vast gap between the two lines of Vafthrúd
108 Norse Mythology



nismál that is filled by the detail leading to Ginnunga gap. In Snorri’s account,
then, the Élivágar preceded even Ginnunga gap and were the first fixed point in
the cosmos, although he never mentions them again.
Hymiskvida gives us good reason to think that the Élivágar were located on
the periphery of the mythological world. Toward the beginning of the poem, as
the gods ponder how they are to obtain the kettle to brew beer for Ægir’s party,
Ty ́r gives Thor a “great loving counsel,” in stanza 5:
There dwells east of the Élivágar
Exceedingly wise Hymir, at the edge of heaven.
My father, the powerful one, owns a kettle,
A huge pot, a league deep.
Finally there is the curious set of stanzas found in Bergbúa tháttr, a thir
teenth-century account of one Thórd and his servant who get lost on his way to
church in winter and take shelter for the night in a cave. There they hear the
supernatural inhabitant of the cave recite a poem predicting various cataclysmic
events. In the seventh (of twelve) stanzas, the poet says that he travels north
down into the third netherworld, and there someone fears his arrival at the
Élivágar. The poem is sometimes difficult to understand, but here at least the
peripheral location of the Élivágar is assured.
There is little useful direct discussion of the Élivágar, but it is clear that
they are meant to be far removed in time, space, or both.

ELLI (OLD-AGE)
Old woman with whom Thor wrestles when he visits Útgarda-Loki.
Thor is unable to throw Elli, and in the end he loses the match when one of his
knees touches down. Only later does Útgarda-Loki explain that Thor’s perform
ance was extraordinary, for Old Age could only make him kneel. Elli is found
only in Snorri’s Gylfaginning.

ELVES
Medieval Icelandic álfar, sg. álfr, mythological beings.
The formula “æsir and elves” is a commonplace in eddic poetry, and as Ragnarök
approaches in Völuspá, the seeress asks “What’s with the æsir? / What’s with the
elves?” This same line is echoed in Thrymskvida. Despite this usage, however,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 109



and despite the appearance of the elves in other lists of mythological beings,
such as those in Alvíssmál, where vocabulary items of the mythological races
are cataloged, little concrete is known about them. The only important figure
explicitly assigned to the elves is Völund: The eddic poem Völundarkvida calls
him prince of the álfar (stanzas 13 and 32), and “countryman of the álfar” (stanza
10). But he has no interaction with elves in or outside of the poem, and although
he does marry a swan maiden and fly off on wings at the end of the poem, his
skill as a smith would suggest association with the dwarfs, as his cognate Way
land the Smith confirms. Nor does Völund have any contact with the gods or
giants of the mythology; his story as we have it belongs to heroic poetry, even
though the person who arranged the Poetic Edda as we have it put it before
Alvíssmál. There Thor indeed plays a role, but so does a dwarf. In fact, the word
álfr appears by itself as a dwarf name in lists of such names and is compounded
with other nouns to make other dwarf names in medieval Icelandic tradition.
Besides Völund, the only other explicitly named elf is Dáin (Hávamál, stanza
143), and that too is more frequently found as a dwarf name.
Snorri introduces in Gylfaginning a distinction between light-elves and
dark-elves. “There is yet that place, which is called Álfheim (Elf-world); there
lives that people, which is called the light-elves, but the dark-elves dwell down
in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance and much more unlike in expe
rience. The light-elves are fairer than the sun in appearance, but the dark-elves
are blacker than pitch.” A few lines later, Snorri has Hár tell Gylfi/Gangleri that
there are three heavens, the highest of which the light-elves alone inhabit. Inso
far as they live in the earth, the dark-elves would appear to be similar, or more
likely identical to, the dwarfs. Twice Snorri says the dwarfs live in Svartálfaheim
(World-of-the-black-elves), and whether he intended a distinction between the
dark-elves and black-elves is unknown, as in fact is any distinction among the
elves outside of Snorri.
The relative lack of information about the elves in the mythology is made
more tantalizing by the references retained in medieval Icelandic tradition to the
álfablót. In recent Scandinavian folklore elves are important as supernatural
nature beings in Danish and Icelandic tradition.

EYRGJAFA
One of nine giant mothers, perhaps of Heimdall, listed in Hyndluljód, stanza 37 (part
of the “Short Völuspá”).

FALHÓFNIR (PALE-HOOFED)
Horse name found in Grímnismál, stanza 30, which lists the horses the æsir ride
each day when they go to make judgments at Yggdrasil.
Snorri Sturluson includes Falhófnir in his list of the horses of the æsir in
Gylfaginning but does not assign the horse to any specific god. Falhófnir is also
listed in the thulur for horses.
FÁRBAUTI (ANGER-STRIKER)
Loki’s father.
Two tenth-century skalds call Loki son of Fárbauti (using, however, the poetic
word mögr for “son” rather than the usual sonr), so the genealogy is assured.
When introducing Loki in Gylfaginning, Snorri tells us that Loki is the son of
Fárbauti the giant, and there is no reason to doubt the assignment of Fárbauti to
the giants, especially given the meaning of his name. Doubtless Loki’s ill will
toward the æsir had to do with his father’s affiliation.
See also Laufey; Loki
FENRIR
Wolf; enemy of the gods.
Fenrir is also called Fenrisúlf, that is, the wolf of Fenrir, and this usage has never
been satisfactorily explained. He has two roles in the mythology: one as the
maimer of Ty ́r early in the mythic present, the other as the killer of Odin at Rag
narök. In between, he lies bound.
Hyndluljód, stanza 40, a part of the “Short Völuspá,” states that Loki sired
the (or a) wolf on Angrboda, and Snorri agrees that Fenrir is the offspring of Loki
and this giantess and that their brood also included Jörmungand (the Midgard
serpent) and Hel. The wolf’s great act in the mythological present is to deprive
Ty ́r of his right hand, an event alluded to directly in Lokasenna, stanza 38. Loki
is upbraiding Ty ́r:
Shut up, Ty ́r. You never knew how
To mediate something good between two people
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 111



Your right hand, that one will I mention
Which Fenrir tore from you.
“To mediate something good between two people” is the standard transla
tion, but an attractive alternative, given what happens next, would be “to carry
something well with two [hands].”
Snorri tells the myth twice in Gylfaginning. On the first occasion, he is
describing Ty ́r and cites the episode as a token of Ty ́r’s bravery:
When the æsir enticed the wolf of Fenrir to permit the fetter to be put on him,
then he did not believe that they would release him, until they placed the hand
of Ty ́r as a pledge in his mouth. And when the æsir were unwilling to release
him, then he bit the hand off, where it is now called the “wolf’s joint” [wrist],
and Ty ́r is one-handed and not called a peacemaker.
A few pages later Snorri tells the full story. When the gods learned that
Loki’s evil offspring with Angrboda were being raised in Jötunheimar, they dis
covered through prophecy that this brood would be trouble for them, and Odin
had them brought to him. He cast the Midgard serpent into the sea and Hel into
the world of the dead. For reasons that are unclear (because Odin had a connec
tion with wolves? Because Loki was Odin’s blood brother?), the gods raised the
wolf with them, and only Ty ́r was brave enough to feed it. But when they saw
how quickly it was growing and reconsidered the prophecies, they decided to
bind the wolf. First they brought a great fetter called Lœding, but Fenrir allowed
them to bind him with it and burst it with his first movements. Next the gods
got a stronger fetter, Drómi, and following a thought process that in English is
reflected in the proverb “Nothing ventured, nothing gained,” the wolf allowed
them to bind him with that fetter and burst it into bits. For this reason, Snorri
tells us, there are proverbs “to loose oneself from Lœding” and “to break out of
Drómi;” neither, however, has left any other trace. The gods now turned to
magic. Alfödr (Odin) sent Skírnir to the dwarfs to obtain a fetter, Gleipnir (per
haps “Entangler”), made from cat noise and woman beard and mountain roots
and bear sinews and fish breath and bird spittle. On the island Lyngvi (Heathery)
in the lake Ámsvartnir (Red-black), they invited the wolf to let himself be bound
again. Needless to say, the wolf was suspicious. What renown could there be in
bursting this fetter, which looked like a silken band? Fenrir stipulated that
someone had to place a hand in his mouth.
And each of the æsir looked at another and thought that now their troubles had
doubled, but none would put forth his hand, until Ty ́r stretched forth his right
hand and put it into the mouth of the wolf. And when the wolf moved, then the
112 Norse Mythology



fetter hardened, and the more he struggled, the sharper it became. Then all the
gods laughed except Ty ́r; he lost his hand.
Lokasenna, stanzas 37–40, comprise an exchange between Ty ́r and Loki.
Loki boasts that Fenrir tore off Ty ́r’s arm; Ty ́r responds that although he may be
missing his hand, Loki is missing Hródrsvitnir, that is, the famous wolf, Fenrir.
Málsháttakvædi, a poem of the twelfth or thirteenth century and usually
thought to have been composed in the Orkneys, is the only poem to refer to the
binding of Fenrir. It has been argued that Ty ́r and Fenrir appear on the eighth
century Alskog Tjängvide picture stone from Gotland.
Vafthrúdnismál gives information about the wolf’s further career. Toward
the end of the poem Odin is asking about the aftermath of Ragnarök, and he
poses this question to Vafthrúdnir:
Whence will come the sun into the smooth heaven,
After Fenrir has destroyed it?
In describing the sun and moon, Snorri says in Gylfaginning that the sun is
ultimately to be swallowed by a wolf called Sköll. When he comes to Ragnarök,
Snorri says simply that a wolf swallows the sun, and another the moon, and it is
apparent that he regards neither of these as identical to Fenrir, for only after
describing the swallowing of the sun and moon and a devastating earthquake
does he report that Fenrir has gotten loose. But Fenrir’s subsequent action echoes
the swallowing of the heavenly bodies, for he “goes about with a gaping mouth,
and the lower jaw is on the earth and the upper against the sky—he would gape
wider if there were room—fires burn from his eyes and nostrils.”
In the series of duels that make up the gods’ last stand against the forces of
chaos, Odin fights with and is killed by Fenrir. Völuspá, stanza 53, reads:
Then the second sorrow of Hlín [Frigg] occurs,
When Odin goes to fight with the wolf.
Völuspá gives no details on Odin’s death, only on the subsequent vengeance:
Then comes the great son of Sigfather [Odin];
Vídar, to fight with the beast of battle;
For the son of Hvedrung, he makes stand with his hand
A sword in the heart; thus the father is avenged.
Hvedrung is surely Loki, since Ynglinga tal, stanza 32, refers to Hel as Hved
rung’s daughter. It is also to be found among the thulur as a word for giant, and,
confusingly, as an Odin name.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 113



Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 53, also tells of Odin’s death in the jaws of the wolf
of Vídar’s vengeance. Odin has just asked Vafthrúdnir about Odin’s fate.
The wolf will swallow Aldafödr [Odin]
Vídar will avenge this;
The malevolent jaws he will cleave
At the death of the wolf.
Snorri agrees that Fenrir swallows Odin and goes on to describe the
vengeance thus:
Immediately thereafter Vídar will come forth and put one foot on the lower jaw
of the wolf. . . . With one hand he will take hold of the upper jaw of the wolf and
tear apart his gullet, and that will be the death of the wolf.
Like his father Loki and his brother the Midgard serpent, then, Fenrir is a
creature who spends time among the gods, is bound or cast out by them, and
returns at the end of the current mythic order to destroy them, only to be
destroyed himself as a younger generation of gods, one of them his slayer, sur
vives into the new world order.

On the Alskog Tjängvide picture stone from Gotland, see Karl Helm, “Zu den gotländischen Bildsteinen,” Beiträge zur deutschen Geschichte und Literatur 62 (1938): 357–361.
FENSALIR (BOG-HALLS)
The abode of Frigg.
The assignment of Fensalir to Frigg is based on a poignant stanza in Völuspá,
stanza 33 (not found in the late Hauksbók version of the poem). The poet is
telling us that vengeance will be taken for Baldr’s killing, “and yet Frigg weeps
over Valhöll’s woe at Fensalir.” Cruelly, Snorri says in Gylfaginning that it was
at Fensalir that Loki wheedled the information from Frigg about Baldr’s vulner
ability to mistletoe; earlier he had said that Frigg lives at Fensalir, “and it is most
esteemed.” In Skáldskaparmál he says that Frigg may be called “Ruler of Fen
salir.” I have no idea why Frigg should live in a boggy place, despite the old argu
ment that there is an association with a cult situated at a spring.

114 Norse Mythology



References and further reading: The notion of a spring cult was advanced by A. Edzardi, “Fensalir und Vegtamskviq 12, 5ff,” Germania 27 (1882): 330–339.
FIMAFENG
Servant of Ægir, killed by Loki according to the prose header to Lokasenna and Snorri
in Skáldskaparmál.
According to the prose header to Lokasenna, Loki could not bear to hear people
praise Fimafeng and Ægir’s other servant, Eldir, and so he killed Fimafeng. For
this outrage he was driven off into the forest. Immediate vengeance was impos
sible, since the site of the feast was a “great place of sanctuary.” Fimafeng might
mean something like “hurrying service.”
See also Eldir; Lokasenna
FIMBUL
Adjective meaning “mighty,” found only in mythological contexts.
Völuspá, stanza 60, refers to the ancient runes of Fimbulty ́r (Mighty-god), who
must be Odin. Stanzas 80 and 142 of Hávamál refer to a fimbulthulr, “mighty
sage or poet,” who again is Odin. Grímnismál, stanza 27, has a list of mytho
logical rivers, including Fimbulthul (Mighty-roar?). The most important of the
fimbul- words is Fimbulvetr (Mighty-winter), which is to occur at the onset of
Ragnarök.
Finally there is Fimbulfambi, mentioned at the end of Hávamál, stanza 103:
He is called Fimbulfambi, who can say little,
That is the nature of an unwise man.
I call this a mythological context, despite the sententious nature of the
lines, because they stand between the Billing’s girl and Gunnlöd episodes in the
poem. In the first Odin fails to get a woman; in the second he succeeds. Odin is
a master of seduction and of words, and everyone else is a fimbul-fool.
See also Billing’s Girl; Gunnlöd; Hávamál
FJALAR (DECEIVER)
One of the most-used names in the mythology, presumably because of all the decep
tion that goes on.
Völuspá appears to have two beings called Fjalar, the first occurring in the cata
log of dwarfs, the second, in stanza 42, a beautiful red rooster that crowed near
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 115



the happy harping herdsman Eggthér at the onset of Ragnarök. In Hávamál,
stanza 14, Fjalar the Learned is a host whose beer the speaker (Odin?) got drunk
on. In Hárbardsljód, stanza 26, Odin is chiding Thor about the latter’s misad
ventures with the giant Skry ́mir on the journey to Útgarda-Loki and says that
Thor did not dare sneeze or fart, lest Fjalar—presumably Skry ́mir —were to hear
it. The most important Fjalar is one of the two dwarfs who killed Kvasir and
made the mead of poetry from his blood, according to Snorri in Skáldskaparmál.
If we take Hávamál, stanza 14, as a reference to Odin’s consumption of the
mead of poetry, we are left with Fjalar the dwarf, Fjalar the rooster, and Fjalar as
Skry ́mir. In the last case it is tempting to think of the name simply as a noun,
“deceiver,” to refer to the shape-changing Skry ́mir.

FJÖLNIR
Odin name; son of Frey in the Learned Prehistory (a medieval historical theory hold
ing that Scandinavians had emigrated from Troy).
In Grímnismál Odin announces a long series of his names (stanzas 46–50) that
constitute the beginning of his epiphany before Geirröd. Fjölnir appears among
them in stanza 47. In Reginsmál a man standing on a mountain, clearly Odin,
uses the name to refer to himself; the stanza is quoted in Völsunga saga. In
Snorri’s Gylfaginning Fjölnir is among the 12 names given for Alfödr and is
listed again when Snorri quotes from Grímnismál. It is also common in skaldic
poetry.
The other Fjölnir, or tradition about Fjölnir, is captured most fully in
Snorri’s Ynglinga saga. There Fjölnir is the son of Frey, king and deity of the
Swedes in Uppsala. During Fjölnir’s reign the Peace of Fródi, which had started
during Frey’s reign, continues, “at Lejre,” that is, in Denmark, according to
Snorri. Fjölnir visits Fródi, and a huge vat of beer is brewed up in the basement
with the floors open above it. That night, sleepy and dead drunk, Fjölnir wanders
out from his bedchamber to relieve himself and falls into the vat, where he per
ishes. The first stanza from Thjódólf’s Ynglinga tal was probably Snorri’s source,
and he cites it here, but it just says that Fjölnir died visiting Fródi.
The etymology of the name is disputed. When Odin bears it, something like
“all-knowing” seems appropriate, but many other possibilities have been
advanced for the prehistoric Swedish king.

116 Norse Mythology



FJÖLVAR
Being, perhaps a giant, with whom Odin spent some time, according the Hárbards
ljód, stanza 17:
I was with Fjölvar all of five winters,
In that island, which is called Algrœn [All-green];
We could fight and fell carrion,
To test much, to try our luck with a maiden.
Since a female Fjölvör is listed among the thulur for giantesses, it seems
likely that Fjölvar would be her male counterpart, and therefore also a giant. In
Hárbardsljód, stanza 18, Odin says that he alone slept with seven sisters on
Algrœn. The incident is otherwise unknown, but it would appear to fit the pat
tern of Odinic seductions in Giantland, known, for example, from the story of
his seduction of Gunnlöd. Algrœn is also found only in this passage.
See also Gunnlöd; Hárbardsljód; Odin
FJÖRGYN
An alternative name for Jörd (Earth) when feminine; the father of Frigg when mascu
line (a distinction lost in the system used in this book for medieval Icelandic names).
Fjörgyn as Jörd is found in Völuspá, stanza 56, in the kenning “Fjörgyn’s son” for
Thor, and even more clearly in Hárbardsljód, stanza 56. Odin as Hárbard has
finally refused to ferry Thor over the sound. The stanza ends this way:
So keep to the left on the road, until you find Verland;
There Fjörgyn will find Thor, her son,
And she will teach him the ways of kinsmen to Odin’s lands.
A few skalds used Fjörgyn (or a noun fjörgyn) for “earth” or “land” in their
verse.
Fjörgyn (masc.) as the father of Frigg is known from Snorri’s Edda, where it
is found in both Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál. Lokasenna, stanza 26,
appears to give the same information. Loki is responding to Frigg:
Shut up, Frigg! You are Fjörgyn’s daughter
and have ever been most eager for men,
when Vé and Vili you allowed, wife of Vidrir,
To embrace you.
There is a small measure of ambiguity here, since the word I have rendered
“daughter” is used in the kenning “Ód’s maiden” for Freyja, who is the wife of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 117



Ód. But if we accept Snorri, who says in both Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál
that Frigg is Fjörgyn’s daughter, we must assume that the information about
Fjörgyn is purely genealogical and has nothing to do with the charge of sexual
insatiability that follows.
See also Jörd
References and further reading: Those who can read Dutch may wish to read Jan de Vries, “Studien over germaansche mythologie, I: Fjorgyn en Fjorgynn,” Tijdschrift voor nederlandsche taal- en letterkunde 50 (1931): 1–25, which
finds that the masculine form of the name is late and that the name originally meant something like “life” or “vital power.”
FÓLKVANG (PEOPLE-FIELD OR ARMY-FIELD)
Freyja’s abode.
Odin’s vision of the dwelling places of the gods in Grímnismál includes Fólk
vang, in stanza 14:
Fólkvang is the ninth, and there Freyja rules
The choice of seats in the hall.
Half the dead she chooses each day,
And Odin has half.
According to Snorri’s Gylfaginning, the hall itself at Fólkvang is called Sess
rúmnir (Seat-roomy), but this information is not found elsewhere.
If we understand Fólk- as “army,” Fólkvang begins to look like some kind
of alternative to Valhöll, where the einherjar dwell until Ragnarök. Freyja too
has an association with warriors who, like the einherjar, fight each day and feast
each night, in that she presides over the Hjadningavíg (an eternal combat of war
riors). In that case, however, the end comes not with Ragnarök but with the
intervention of a Christian.
See also Freyja; Hjadningavíg
FORNJÓT
Progenitor of the elements, according to Norwegian tradition.
This tradition is located in Fundinn Noregr (Norway Found), as the beginning of
Orkneyinga saga (The Saga of the Orkney Islanders) is sometimes called, and in a
section of Flateyjarbók called Hversu Noregr byggdisk (How Norway Was Settled).
According to them Fornjót was a king who ruled Gotland or Jutland, “which is
called Finnland [i.e., the land of the Sámi or Lapps] and Kvenland [the Finnish
settled part of northern Norway].” Some editors alter “Gotland” or “Jutland” to
“that land.” Fornjót had three sons: Hlér (“whom we call Ægir,” according to
118 Norse Mythology



Fundinn Noregr), Logi, and Kári. Ægir and hlér are nouns meaning “sea.” The noun
logi means “fire,” and kári is listed among the thulur for “wind.” Kári, according to
Fundinn Noregr, was the father of Frosti (Frost), the father of Snær (Snow) the Old.
From there the genealogy goes into some of the month names of the old Scandina
vian system. Hversu Noregr byggdisk has a somewhat more elaborate genealogy:
Kári’s son is Jökull (Glacier); his son, Snær (Snow); his children, Thorri (the name
of the fourth month of winter), Fönn (Heap-of-snow), Drífa (Snowdrift), and Mjöll
(Fresh-powdery-snow). The last three nouns are feminine, and we are presumably
to understand these children as daughters, but Thorri is a masculine noun, and
Thorri is a king. He had three children, sons Nór and Gór and a daughter Gói. She
vanished, and when Thorri held the sacrifice a month later than usual, they named
the month after her (Gói followed Thorri in the old Scandinavian calendar).
Fornjót is found only twice in older poetry. In Ynglinga tal, stanza 29,
Thjódólf of Hvin seems to use the kenning “son of Fornjót” to mean fire, and a
poet known only as Svein apparently uses the kenning “ugly sons of Fornjót” for
wind (Snorri quotes the line in Skáldskaparmál as an example of this kenning).
Fornjót is included among the thulur for giants.
The meaning of the name is unclear. It can be analyzed as Forn-jótr (Ancient
Jutlander, or possibly Giant), or For-njótr (Early-user or Early-destroyer), Forn-njótr
(One-who-enjoys-sacrifices), or even perhaps Forn-πjótr (Ancient-screamer).

References and further reading: Margaret Clunies Ross, “Snorri Sturluson’s Use of the Norse Origin Legend of the Sons of Fornjót in his Edda,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 98 (1983): 47–66, analyzes Snorri’s understanding of natural forces as giants.
FORSETI (CHAIRMAN)
Baldr and Nanna’s son.
In poetry Forseti is found only in Grímnismál, stanza 15, in Odin’s vision enu
merating the abodes of the gods.
Glitnir is the tenth. It is studded with gold
And thatched with silver as well.
And there Forseti dwells most of the day
And settles all lawsuits.
Snorri includes Forseti in the catalog of æsir in Gylfaginning:
Forseti is the son of Baldr and Nanna Nepsdóttir. He has that hall in heaven,
which is called Glitnir, and all who come to him in legal difficulties go away
reconciled. That is the best place of judgment of gods and men.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 119



Except for his presence at Ægir’s banquet in the beginning of Skáldskap
armál and in the list of Baldr kennings (in “Forseti’s father”), Forseti is otherwise
unknown in the mythology. Since the nineteenth century some scholars have
wished to associate him with Fosite, a god after whom a Frisian island is sup
posed to be named, according to Alcuin’s Life of St. Willebrord from the end of
the ninth century. The original Germanic form would be closer to the Frisian
and would have been converted by the Scandinavians into the common noun
forseti (which is still in use today as the title of the president of Iceland).

FREKI (RAVENOUS-ONE)
One of Odin’s wolves.
Grímnismál, stanza 19, part of Odin’s vision of the abodes of the gods, mentions
Freki:
Geri and Freki the one accustomed to battle feeds,
Glorious Herjafödr [Odin];
And on wine alone the weapon-noble
Odin ever lives.
Snorri quotes this stanza in Gylfaginning and puts the two halves together,
saying that Odin gives his own food to the wolves, as he lives on wine alone.
The name is simply the definite form of an adjective, and it is more than a
little ironic that the same adjective is used in Völuspá in a repeated stanza (44,
49, 58) about Ragnarök:
Garm howls much before Gnipahellir.
Fetters will burst, and the ravenous one [freki] run free.
Thus Odin feeds one ravenous one at his side in Valhöll and another—with
his body—at Ragnarök.

FREY
Important god, member of the vanir.
Frey is the son of Njörd, either by his
sister when he lived among the vanir or
by Skadi. When Snorri says in Gylfagin
ning that Njörd had two children,
apparently by Skadi, he first introduces
Frey and Freyja, saying that they were
both good-looking and powerful:
Frey is the most noble of the æsir. He
rules over rain and sunshine and with
that the growth of the earth, and it is
good to call on him for prosperity and
peace. He also rules over the wealth of
men.
This is practically a textbook de
scription of a fertility god. In the warlike
culture of the æsir, there is little for him
to do, and the mythology only grants
him three moments: his entry into the
æsir, his marriage, and his death.
Frey joined the æsir as a result of
the Æsir-Vanir War, according to Snorri
in Ynglinga saga. When a settlement
was reached, the two groups “ex
changed hostages [here understood as
men exchanged as pledges of good faith]. The vanir sent their most distinguished
men, Njörd and Frey, and the æsir in exchange sent Hœnir, whom they declared
to be a great leader, and Mímir, who was very wise.” Although Hœnir could
make no decision without Mímir, whom the vanir finally decapitated, Njörd and
Frey were a success, and the æsir made them into leaders of cult.
Frey’s courtship of Gerd is the one full narrative about him in the mythol
ogy, although in fact he acts rather passively in it. The story is the subject of the
eddic poem Skírnismál and is paraphrased in much shorter form by Snorri in
Gylfaginning. To follow the story in Skírnismál: Frey had seated himself in Hlid
skjálf, Odin’s high seat, with its view into all the worlds. Looking into Jötun
heimar, he saw a beautiful maiden and immediately fell lovesick. Skírnir, Frey’s
servant, is asked to look into the matter. Frey explains that the gleaming arms
of a maiden at Gymir’s farmstead have captivated him:

7. The maiden is more dear to me than to any young
Man, in days of yore;
No one wishes, of the æsir and elves,
That the two of us come together.
Given Frey’s horse and sword, Skírnir sets out to woo the girl on his mas
ter’s behalf. At Gymir’s homestead he is challenged first by a shepherd, then by
the girl herself, Gerd. Invited in (though she fears, Gerd says, that he may be the
slayer of her brother), Skírnir begins his blandishments. Gerd refuses first golden
apples and then the ring Draupnir, saying she has no need of gold. Skírnir now
turns to threats: He will kill her and her father; he will tame her through magic.
He turns to curses: She will be a laughingstock, forced to live among the giants,
with a three-headed giant or with no man at all. The æsir are angry at her. She
is forbidden joy of men, will live with a giant beneath the Corpse-gate (Nágrind,
one of the gates to Hel’s realm), be offered goat urine. Finally Skírnir goes into
some kind of runic threat, and Gerd capitulates. The wedding will be in nine
nights, at a place called Barri. Skírnir returns home and tells the news to Frey,
who does not rejoice; he laments:
42. A night is long, longer are two,
How will I endure three?
Oft to me a month seemed shorter
Than this half honeymoon.
For most of the twentieth century Magnus Olsen’s nature mythological
interpretation of this myth held sway: Skírnir is the sun’s ray, sent down from
heaven to retrieve Gerd (“earth”) from the underworld; the tryst will be at Barri
(“in the seed”). Most serious scholars of Norse mythology today would point out
that the etymologies required to support this reading are questionable and would
not have been at all apparent to a medieval audience. The myth can instead be
read as part of the ongoing struggle between the æsir and jötnar, in which the
æsir nearly always succeed in obtaining valuables, often women, from the world
of the giants. The flow of such wealth is nearly always in one direction only. Fur
thermore, as Margaret Clunies Ross showed, this and the Njörd-Skadi myth
serve to place the vanir hierarchically below the rest of the æsir: The æsir can
take wives from among the ásynjur, but the vanir must turn to the giants, where
the other gods find concubines but not wives.
At Ragnarök Frey will fight Surt (Völuspá, stanza 53). In Gylfaginning Snorri
carries Frey’s giving of his sword to Skírnir over to this scene, where, he says,
Frey will be swordless and will therefore perish. This is not, according to Snorri,
the first time Frey has fought without a sword; at the end of his presentation of
122 Norse Mythology



the Gerd myth, Snorri says that Frey fought the giant Beli without his sword and
killed him with the antler of a hart.
According to Grímnismál, stanza 5, the gods gave Álfheim to Frey as a gift
in days of yore when he cut his first tooth, and this was therefore presumably
Frey’s dwelling place. Snorri, on the other hand, assigns Álfheim to the so-called
light-elves. Frey has two precious objects, the ship Skídbladnir (although Snorri
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 123

the historical Frey was buried in such a mound. (Courtesy of Roger Buton)



in Ynglinga saga assigns this ship to Odin) and the boar Gullinborsti (Gold
bristle) or Slídrugtanni. Both these objects were made by the dwarfs Ívaldi and
Brokk, according to Snorri’s Skáldskaparmál (Grímnismál, stanza 43, mentions
only the ship). In his account of Baldr’s funeral, Úlf Uggason says that Frey
arrived riding a boar with golden bristles, and Snorri understood this to be
Gullinborsti and added that it was pulling the cart in which Frey rode.
Lokasenna assigns two servants to Frey, Byggvir and Beyla, whom scholars
interpret through etymology as associated with barley and either cows, beans, or
bees; all of these can be made to fit with the notion of a fertility god. Loki’s
insult to Frey in the poem is a reminder of the sword given up for Gerd and the
problem that its loss will pose at Ragnarök.
In Snorri’s version of the Learned Prehistory in chapter 10 of Ynglinga saga,
Frey is one of the important early kings of Sweden. He succeeds his father Njörd,
who succeeded Odin. He was popular and prosperous like his father. Frey erected
a large temple at Uppsala and established his principal residence there, gave it
all that was owed him, lands, and money. Then began the wealth of Uppsala, and
it has lasted ever since.
In his days the Peace of Fródi began. At that time there was also prosperity
throughout all lands. The Swedes attributed that to Frey. The more wealthy the
people became through peace and prosperity, the more he was worshipped than
the other gods.
The passage goes on to say that Frey married Gerd the daughter of Gymir,
that their son was Fjölnir (in the Eddas this is an Odin name), that Frey’s other
name was Yngvi, and that for this reason his descendants are called the Ynglingar.
Snorri next tells a curious story about Frey’s death. After Frey dies, his men
place the corpse in a mound but do not reveal his death. Freyja takes over the
sacrifices, and Frey’s men maintain the body for three years. When the Swedes
finally learn of Frey’s death, they believe that their peace and prosperity is
dependent on his body being present in Sweden and do not wish to have him cre
mated. They declare him to be the veraldar god (“world god”) and forever after
sacrifice to him for peace and prosperity.
This story bears a close similarity to that of the concealed death of King
Frotho (Fródi) III in Book 5 of Saxo’s Gesta Danorum, which also lasts for three
years. And Fródi is also famously associated with peace and prosperity. Clearly
the two figures played out the same mythic pattern, and many scholars think
they may once have been the same figure.
According to Book 1 of Saxo’s Gesta Danorum, the prehistoric Danish king
Hadingus carried out a sacrifice to Frey and established an annual sacrifice to Frø
(Frey), which the Swedes call Frøblot.
124 Norse Mythology



The tale Ögmundar tháttr dytts gives information on what a high medieval
Icelandic audience thought about the worship of Frey in Uppsala. Ögmund, an Ice
lander, has fled the court of Olaf Tryggvason in Norway because he is falsely sus
pected of the murder of one of the king’s men. Coming to Sweden, he meets and
befriends a priestess of Frey. The god is a statue, inhabited by a demon and pulled
about on a cart. Ögmund wrestles away the demon through the divine interven
tion of King Olaf and thereafter impersonates Frey. The Swedes are delighted that
their god deigns to eat and drink with them and are impressed when his priestess
becomes pregnant. Unlike before, Frey is now willing to be propitiated with gold
and fine clothing. Times are good until King Olaf arrives to bring Ögmund back
to Norway. Ögmund marries Frey’s priestess and both are baptized.
Place-names showing worship of Frey are especially popular in eastern Swe
den. Writing around the year 1070, Adam of Bremen, in his history of the arch
bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen, described the pagan temple at Uppsala. In it were
statues of three gods, one of them, Fricco, who clearly reflects Frey, equipped
with an enormous phallus. A small figurine found in Rällinge, Sweden, has a
similar feature and has been interpreted as Frey and associated with a statement
in Vatnsdœla saga to the effect that a worshiper of Frey carried a figurine of the
god. Other Sagas of Icelanders mention people who were priests (goƒar) of Frey.
The most famous of them, Hrafnkel, the title character of Hrafnkels saga, owned
a horse he kept sacred to Frey. The extent to which these materials represent
worship of Frey is not clear, but Frey was certainly known as an important deity.

Margaret Clunies Ross’s reading of the mythology, including the hierarchical role of vanir-giant marriages, is in Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Icelandic Society, vol. 1: The Myths (Odense: Odense University
Press, 1994). The first serious objection to Olsen’s seasonal hypothesis was by Jöran Sahlgren, Eddica et Scaldica: Fornvästnordiska studier 1–2, Nordisk filologi, undersökningar och handlingar, 1 (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1927–1928), who on pages 209–303 argued that there are parallels with folk tale and saga. More recently, Lars Lönnroth interpreted the myth sociologically in “Skírnismál och den fornisländska äktenskapsnormen,” in Opuscula Septentrionalia: Festskrift til Ole Widding, 10.10.1977, ed. Bent Chr. Jacobsen et al. (Copenhagen: C. A.

Mitchell tried a structural analysis in “For Scírnis as Mythological Model: Friƒ at kaupa,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 98 (1983): 109–122. The implications of a presumed sacral marriage, however, animate the literary analysis of Ursula Dronke, “Art

FREYJA (LADY)
Important goddess; only named female of the vanir; object of giants’ lust.
Freyja is the daughter of Njörd, either by his sister when he lived among the
vanir or by Skadi. When Snorri says in Gylfaginning that Njörd had two chil
dren, apparently by Skadi, he first introduces Frey and Freyja, saying that they
were both good-looking and powerful.
And Freyja is the most excellent of the goddesses. She has that homestead in
heaven which is called Fólkvang, and wherever she rides to battle she has half
the dead, and Odin half. . . . Her hall is Sessrúmnir; it is great and handsome.
And when she travels, she drives her cats and sits in a carriage. She is the most
accessible for people to call on, and from her name it is a sign of respect that
women of substance are called frúvur [ladies]. She enjoys erotic poetry. It is good
to call on her for love.
In the first half of this passage, Snorri was paraphrasing Grímnismál, stanza
14, which he had just quoted. Then, a few pages later, seemingly contradicting
his statement that Freyja was the most excellent of the ásynjur, Snorri listed her
only sixth in the catalog of ásynjur, although he did say that she is equal in
nobility to Frigg.
She is married to Ód, and their daughter is Hnoss. . . . Ód went away on long
journeys, and Freyja weeps for him, and her tears are red gold. Freyja has many
names, and the reason for that is that she called herself by various names when
she went about among unknown peoples looking for Ód. She is called Mardöll
and Hörn, Gefn, Sy ́r. Freyja owned the Brísinga men.
Ód’s journeys are not mentioned in the older poetry, although “Ód’s bed
friend” is a Freyja kenning in skaldic poetry, and Freyja’s journeys in search of
126 Norse Mythology



him are completely undocumented. Her ownership of the Brísinga men is
alluded to in Thrymskvida and perhaps explained in Sörla tháttr. Thrymskvida
also mentions a feather coat that Freyja lends to Loki, giving him the gift of
flight. Loki borrows the same item from Freyja in the story of his retrieval of
Idun from Thjazi in Skáldskaparmál.
In the extant mythology Freyja exists primarily as an object of lust for male
giants. Thrym will only return Thor’s stolen hammer if he gets Freyja in return;
the giant who is to build the wall around Ásgard demands Freyja, the sun, and
the moon as his wages; and Hrungnir boasts drunkenly in Ásgard that he will
kill all the æsir except Freyja and Sif, whom he will carry off. Freyja’s reputation,
meanwhile, is somewhat questionable. When asked to go off as Thrym’s bride so
that Thor can get his hammer back, she protests that everyone will know her to
be most eager for men if she does so. In Lokasenna Loki tells her that she has
been lover of all the assembled æsir and elves; she even was caught in flagrante
delicto with her brother, and then, Loki says, “you had to fart”—an insult or joke
whose exact tenor escapes us today. Of course, Loki accuses all the goddesses of
sexual indiscretion, but Sörla tháttr says flat out that Freyja plies the oldest pro
fession, for she gives herself to four dwarfs in order to obtain a beautiful neck
lace, perhaps the Brísinga men. In Hyndluljód Hyndla accuses Freyja of being the
lover of Óttar, the human whose genealogy the poem explores.
This sexual history, and her fondness for erotic poetry, make plausible
Snorri’s assertion that it is to Freyja whom one must turn in affairs of the heart.
Presumably this attachment to human love accords with the notion of the vanir
as fertility deities. We might reasonably expect a fertility deity to be associated
with the dead, but in this mythology, at least, the evidence all goes in the other
direction. Odin, the god of wisdom and magic, has the closest association with
the dead, and the other vanir, Njörd and Frey, have no such connection. Indeed,
the word Snorri used for the dead whom Freyja shares equally with Odin refers
to those who die in battle. This association with the battle-dead may also under
lie Freyja’s connection with the eternal battle of the Hjadningavíg, which has
obvious parallels to the endless battles of the einherjar.
Freyja is also connected with magic, especially the kind of shamanic magic
called seid. In Ynglinga saga Snorri says that Freyja first taught seid among the æsir,
and many scholars surmise that Freyja is identical with the figure Gullveig in
Völuspá, whom the æsir cannot kill and who apparently under the name Heid per
forms seid. Seid, like the dead, is something that Freyja and Odin share. It may thus
be pertinent to recall here Odin’s sexual promiscuity and his many names. Finally,
the names Ód (Óƒr) and Odin (Óƒinn) look like a doublet, parallel to Ull and Ullin,
and Saxo has a story in Book 1 of Gesta Danorum about a long absence of Odin
from his realm, which some scholars think is parallel to Ód’s absences.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 127



We know that Freyja was a potent force in the last years of paganism, in Ice
land at least, because of a famous incident recounted in connection with the
conversion. Hjalti Skeggjason, one of the supporters of the conversion, was out
lawed for blasphemy at the althingi because of a little ditty he recited calling
Freyja a bitch (i.e., a female dog; it has been suggested that he wished to suggest
that she was a whore). She also appeared frequently as a base word in woman
kennings of the early skalds, and many place-names indicate a worship of her.

FRIGG
Goddess, wife of Odin and mother of Baldr.
In Gylfaginning Snorri cites Frigg as foremost among the goddesses, as would be
appropriate for the consort of Odin. Indeed, in the mythology as we have it she
mostly functions as wife and mother. She warns Odin not to contest in wisdom
with Vafthrúdnir, the wisest giant, but wishes him well when he perseveres
(Vafthrúdnismál, stanzas 1–4), and sorrows upon his death at Ragnarök
(Völuspá, stanza 53). In the prose header to Grímnismál she quarrels with Odin
over the fate of their protégés. In Snorri’s version of the Baldr story she first
extracts an oath from all things not to harm Baldr, and when that fails, as the
result of her own interaction with the disguised Loki, she dispatches Hermód to
Hel to try to retrieve him. According to Völuspá, stanza 33, she weeps at Fen
salir after Baldr’s death, and Snorri says that Fensalir is her dwelling. And in the
Second Merseburg Charm, from the tenth century or earlier, Frija, the Old High
German equivalent to Frigg, participates in the curing of Baldere’s (Baldr’s) horse;
Odin is also present.
However, there is tantalizing information of a far different nature. Accord
ing to Snorri in Ynglinga saga, once when Odin had been away on a journey for
a particularly long time, Odin’s brothers, Vili and Vé, divided his inheritance and
both possessed Frigg, but Odin later returned and took her back. Saxo Gram
maticus tells a somewhat similar story in Book 1 of the Gesta Danorum. In order
to adorn herself with gold, Frigga despoils a statue of Othinus and then gives her
128 Norse Mythology



self to a servant in order to enlist his aid in taking down the statue. In shame,
Othinus goes into self-imposed exile, and during his exile a sorcerer called
Mithothyn takes his place and institutes a change in cult procedures. Upon Oth
inus’s return Mithothyn flees to Fyn and is killed by the inhabitants there.
Loki knew a version of this story and was not above reminding Frigg about
it. In Lokasenna, stanza 26, when Frigg tries to silence Loki, he rebukes her.
Shut up, Frigg! You are Fjörgyn’s daughter
and have ever been most eager for men,
when Vé and Vili you allowed, wife of Vidrir [Odin],
to embrace you.
Frigg does not dispute the charge, but in response she says that if she had a
son like Baldr on the scene, Loki would not get out alive. This gives Loki a
chance to claim responsibility for the death of Baldr (stanzas 27–28). At this
point Freyja intervenes, warning Loki that Frigg knows the fates of all people,
although she chooses not to disclose them (stanza 29, also quoted by Snorri in
Gylfaginning).
It is not easy to make sense of this material. To be called “Fjörgyn’s daugh
ter” (Snorri has the same information, but the name is otherwise unattested) is
hardly an insult. Fjörgyn, in the feminine form of the name (a distinction lost in
the system used in this book for medieval Icelandic names), is Thor’s mother.
The taking of Odin’s inheritance by Vili and Vé in Odin’s absence in Ynglinga
saga might indicate the absence of a legitimate heir, so this incident might have
occurred early in Odin’s career. Frigga’s infidelity with the slave is hardly of the
same order. The discord suggested by the prose header to Grímnismál finds a
parallel in an incident in Paul the Deacon’s History of the Langobards, written
in the second half of the eighth century. Here Godan (Odin) and Frea (Frigg) dis
pute over an upcoming battle between the Vandals, whom Godan favors, and the
people who will become the Langobards, whom Frea favors.
The name Frigg is derived from an Indo-European root meaning “love,” and
in the Interpretatio Germanica, it was Frigg who was given the day of Venus,
that is, Friday. This may accord with the Scandinavian stories of Frigg’s infi
delity. Her silent gift of prophecy, however, remains unexplained. It would
belong more properly to Freyja, with her association with seid. The name Frigg
is frequently found in Scandinavian place-names indicating cult activity. Based
on the Swedish place-name evidence, Hugo Jungner argued that Frigg and Freyja
were once identical. Although that cannot be proved, there certainly are simi
larities, not least in Freyja’s marriage to Ód, who also is frequently away on jour
neys. Oddrúnargrátr, stanza 9, has a formula: “May the gracious beings help
you, / Frigg and Freyja / and more gods.”

FRÓDI
Ancient Danish king and figure of heroic legend.
In his account of the story told to explain the kenning “Fródi’s flour” for gold in
Skáldskaparmál, Snorri says that Skjöld was a son of Odin and the founder of
the Skjöldung dynasty in Denmark. His son was Fridleif, and Fridleif’s son was
Fródi. Fródi ascended to the throne at the time Emperor Augustus had imposed
peace on the entire world when Christ was born.
But because Fródi was the most powerful of all kings in the northern lands,
the peace was ascribed to him wherever Scandinavian was spoken, and the people
of the north call it the Peace of Fródi. No man harmed another, even if he encoun
tered the killer of his father or brother, free or bound. At that time there was no
thief or robber, so that a certain gold ring lay for a long time on Jelling heath.
Snorri probably got the precise details of the Peace of Fródi from stanza 6 of
the poem Grottasöng (which he cited right after telling about Fródi’s demise
through the actions of two slave girls he had purchased to turn an enormous
mill).
Here no one should harm another,
Live for evil or work for death,
Nor strike with a sharp sword,
Even if the killer of his brother he find bound.
In the poem this peace appears to relate to Fródi’s seat at Hleiƒra (modern
Lejre in Denmark), whereas in Snorri’s version the peace is temporal and euhe
merized with the birth of Christ. Scholars believe that Snorri took both of these
notions from Skjöldunga saga, an account of the early Danish kings that is now
known only through a seventeenth-century Latin paraphrase. But Snorri knew
(or told of) another version of the Peace of Fródi, which he recounted in chapter
10 of his Ynglinga saga. According to this account, the Peace of Fródi was asso
ciated with Frey, here euhemerized as a king of Sweden who had succeeded
Njörd, who had succeeded Odin himself. But Snorri slips out of his euhemeriza
tion somewhat:
130 Norse Mythology



In his days the Peace of Fródi began. At that time there was also prosperity in
all lands. The Swedes attributed that to Frey. The more wealthy the people
became through peace and prosperity, the more he was worshipped than the
other gods.
Interestingly, Snorri introduces Fródi in the next chapter, calling him
“Peace-Fródi” and putting him in Lejre at the same time that Frey’s son Fjölnir
is in Uppsala. Perhaps Snorri moved the Peace from Fródi to Frey, or perhaps, as
some scholars have come to believe, Frey and Fródi were in effect two versions
of the same figure, a local fertility god. That assumption finds strength in the ref
erences to Frey in stanzas 1 and 2 of Skírnismál as “the fródi,” that is, “the wise
one” or “the fruitful one.”
In Vellekla, a poem from the end of the tenth century praising Hákon the
Hladir jarl, the poet Einar Helgason skálaglamm said that no ruler had brought
about such peace and prosperity except Fródi.
Saxo names several kings called Frotho, the Latin equivalent of the Norse
Fródi. Of these the most relevant is Frotho III, who is the subject of the pivotal
fifth book of Gesta Danorum. This Fródi, the son of Fridleif, is a successful Dan
ish king renowned for lawgiving. Having defeated his enemies, he institutes an
era of peace in his land, ridding it of theft, and to test this peace he hangs a heavy
golden arm ring at a crossroads. Fearful of his authority, no thief dares take it,
and he derives great fame from this act. Saxo tells us that this period coincides
with Christ’s stay on earth, and it is ended when a wicked woman urges her son
to steal the arm ring, and then, trying to hide from Fródi’s wrath in the form of
a sea cow, she gores and kills him. To forestall the possibility of rebellion or
invasion, the Danes conceal Fródi’s death, embalm the body, and carry it about
in a cart for three years before finally burying it. This story bears close similar
ity to Snorri’s account of the death of Frey in Ynglinga saga, since Frey’s death
also is concealed for three years, during which time peace and prosperity con
tinue. Ögmundar tháttr dytts tells of the worship of an idol of Frey transported
in a cart near Uppsala, and, more distantly, Tacitus reports this of the goddess
Nerthus.
Fródi would therefore appear to be a historicized remnant of one or more
aspects of the myth and cult of the vanir, associated with peace and prosperity.

In “Appolon emintheús and the Teutonic Mysing,” Archiv für Religionswissenschaft 33 (1936): 40–56, Alexander Haggerty Krappe argued an implausible connection between Fródi’s killer My ́sing in the Norse tradition and the Greek emintheús (mouse-god), perhaps the plague.
FULLA
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists Fulla fifth in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the æsir
and says, “She is still a virgin and goes about with her hair down and a gold band
about her head; she carries Frigg’s trunk and looks after her shoes and shares
secret counsels with her.” The prose preceding Grímnismál in the Poetic Edda
says that Frigg sent her “trunk-maiden” Fulla to Geirröd to trick him into mis
treating the disguised Odin, and in Skáldskaparmál Snorri says that “ruler of
Fulla” is a kenning for Frigg. Nanna sent a finger ring back to Fulla from the
world of the dead in Snorri’s recounting of the Baldr story, and Fulla is numbered
with other important goddesses among the guests at Ægir’s party, according to
the beginning of Skáldskaparmál.
Fulla is presumably identical to the Volla of the Second Merseburg Charm.
The etymology of the name appears to have to do with fullness, perhaps there
fore fertility.

GALAR (YELLER)
See Mead of Poetry
GALDRAR
Magic charms.
What we think we know about galdrar we get from the sagas. In the mythology,
these are especially associated with Odin. In Baldrs draumar, stanza 3, Odin is
called the father of galdrar, and Hávamál, from about stanza 135 onward,
describes his mastery of magic songs. Although these are called songs rather
than charms, they clearly are galdrar. Euhemerizing in chapter 7 of his Ynglinga
saga, Snorri wrote of Odin’s magic arts,
All these skills he taught with runes and those songs that are called galdrar.
Because of this the æsir were called smiths of galdrar. Odin knew that art called
seid, and he carried it out himself.
132 Norse Mythology



The noun appears to be a simple past participle of the verb gala, “crow,
yell.” Although some commentators distinguish galdrar from ljóƒ as spoken
rather than sung, it is difficult to find any primary source material that enforces
the distinction.
Interestingly, one of the meters of eddic poetry is called galdrar meter. It is
an extended form of ljóƒaháttr, “song or chant meter.”

GAME OF THE GODS
Motif associated with the golden age of the gods and with the survival of the race of
gods after Ragnarök.
The key passages are in Völuspá, which gives a synopsis of the entire mythol
ogy. In stanza 8 the gods have just completed their creation and ordering of the
cosmos and their building of cult sites and tools:
8. They played a game in the home field, were merry
For them there was no lack of gold.
At this point their “golden age” is disrupted by the arrival of three powerful
giant maidens from Jötunheimar. The rest of the poem details the struggles and
conflicts of the world of the gods, until finally they and the cosmos are destroyed
at Ragnarök. But after Ragnarök the earth comes up a second time, and æsir will
meet and inhabit it. They have memories of the old mythology (stanza 60), but
they also have concrete objects from the earlier times.
61. There they will find wondrous
Golden gaming pieces in the grass,
Those which in ancient times they had had before.
Unsown fields will grow, and Baldr will return—surely this is some kind of
new golden age, or perhaps a return to that time when the world was not solely
defined as a place of conflict.
The gaming pieces, then, are clearly symbolic, and what kind of game might
have been played with them is anybody’s guess. There was an elaborate “hunt
ing game” (so-called because one player, with a greater number of pieces, attacks
the other, who starts with a smaller number of pieces) called hnefatafl, but we
cannot be certain this is what the Völuspá poet had in mind. Certainly gaming
pieces were items of high status, as the Lewis chess set and other finds indicate.
It may also be noteworthy that the very late Sturlaugs saga starfsama places a
golden gaming set in a supposed temple of Thor.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 133



A. G. van Hamel advanced an elaborate and not very convincing hypothe
sis to the effect that the game ruled the world independently of the will of the
gods and that its end caused Ragnarök. Perhaps more intriguing is the answer
to one of the riddles in the riddle sequence in Hervarar saga. The riddles are put
by Gestumblindi, who is actually Odin in disguise, and are solved by King Hei
drek up to the very last one, which repeats the question at the epiphany in
Vafthrúdnismál: What did Odin say into the ear of Baldr before he was put on
the funeral pyre? Three of the riddles involve hnefatafl, and the first of them is
as follows:
Who are those thanes who ride to the assembly
All reconciled together; their peoples
They send over lands to build settlements.
King Heidrek, ponder the riddle.
The answer varies according to the manuscripts: either Ítrek’s board game or
Ítrek and Andad, sitting at their board game. If, as some have suggested, Ítrek is an
Odin name, the first reading might suggest the game of the gods. But since Andud,
a possible variant of Andad, is a giant name, according to the thulur, the second
reading would situate the game in the ongoing struggle between gods and giants.

GARM
Dog, “best of hounds” according to Grímnismál, stanza 44.
The stanza is recited by Odin as he hangs in the fire at the home of King Geir
röd toward the end of the poem and just before he begins the recitation of his
names that culminates in an epiphany. Stanza 44 has a list of things that are best
in the mythological world: Yggdrasil of trees, Skídbladnir of ships, Odin of æsir,
Sleipnir of horses, Bilröst of bridges, Bragi of skalds, Hábrók of hawks, and,
finally, Garm of hounds. In this company we would expect Garm to be a posi
tive figure, but in his only other appearance in poetry, repeated three times more
or less verbatim in Völuspá (stanzas 44, 49, and 58), he is anything but:
Garm howls loudly before Gnipahellir
The bond will burst, and the wolf run free.
134 Norse Mythology



Here Garm appears to be identical with Fenrir, the bound wolf who will get
free at Ragnarök. Writing about Ragnarök in Gylfaginning, Snorri, who knew and
had already quoted in another context the stanza from Grímnismál, calls Garm
“the greatest monster” and says that after getting from the place before Gnipa
hellir where he is bound, he will fight with Ty ́r and they will kill each other.
The name (or noun?) is used as a base word in kennings, always with the
connotation of one who destroys (e.g., fire is the “Garm of wood”). Thus, Snorri’s
beast Mánagarm (Moon-dog) must be the destroyer of the moon, and that is pre
cisely what Snorri says he is in Gylfaginning.
See also Bound Monster; Mánagarm
GEFJON
Minor goddess and/or female figure of legendary prehistory.
Snorri lists Gefjon fourth in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the
æsir and says she is a virgin, served by those women who died unmarried. Snorri
also numbers her among the goddesses at Ægir’s party at the beginning of Skáld
skaparmál and again when he is discussing gold kennings. She also makes an
appearance in Lokasenna, where she follows Idun in trying to discourage the ver
bal dueling. Loki says to her: “Shut up, Gefjon! / That one will I now mention,
/ who seduced you: / the white lad, / who gave you a piece of jewelry, / and you
lay your thigh over him.”
The most intriguing Gefjon story is recorded as part of the Ragnarsdrápa of
Bragi Boddason the Old, taken to be the earliest known skald. Bragi is describing
scenes decorating a shield, and one difficult stanza says that Gefjon, using four
oxen, plowed land that she then took from Gylfi and added to Denmark. This
verse is found in some manuscripts of Snorri’s Edda and in his Heimskringla. In
the manuscripts of Snorri’s Edda that have the verse, it accompanies the fol
lowing story, which opens Gylfaginning: Gylfi, the prehistoric Swedish king
whose “delusions” at the hands of the æsir will make up the subject of this sec
tion of the Edda, had once given “to a traveling woman as payment for his pleas
ure” (that is, as payment to a prostitute) the land she could plow up in a day and
a night using four oxen. That woman was Gefjon, of the family of the æsir. “She
took four oxen from the north out of Jötunheimar, and those were the sons of a
giant and her,” and with their supernatural power they plowed up an entire piece
of land and took it west to a sound, where they put it down. Gefjon named it
Selund (modern Sjælland, the main island of Denmark, on which the city of
Copenhagen is now located). And a body of water was left behind in Sweden,
Gylfi’s realm, called Lögrinn (the lake, i.e., Lake Mälaren, west of Stockholm),
and the bays in Lögrinn match the headlands on Seland.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 135



When Snorri told this story and quoted the verse in Ynglinga saga, he says
that Odin had just settled at Óƒinsey (Odin’s island, modern Odense in Den
mark; the name is more likely to derive from “Odin’s holy place,” but that
would not have suited Snorri’s purpose in Ynglinga saga). From there, Odin sent
Gefjon north to look for land, and she came to Gylfi, who gave her plow land; no
motivation for the gift is provided. She went to Jötunheimar, got four sons by a
certain giant, changed them into oxen, and plowed up and transported the land
that was to be Seland, thereby creating Lögrinn, whose fjords match the head
lands of Seland. She settled in Seland, and Odin married her to his son Skjöld.
These varying conceptions and stories are not easy to reconcile. We are faced
with a prostitute who is said to be a virgin goddess, and a goddess—virgin or
not—who is said to have had children with a giant, which should disqualify her
as a goddess because the sexual traffic is all in the opposite direction. In other
words, we have both physical and mythological impossibilities. Some of the
inconsistencies recede if we understand Gefjon as a figure of prehistory, a mem
ber of the æsir not in their roles as gods but in their role as “Asia-men,” as the
Icelandic Learned Prehistory understood them, and as Snorri presented them in
the Prologue to his Edda, the frame to Gylfaginning, and Ynglinga saga. This
Gefjon had a clear association with Denmark, especially Sjælland, even if no
other texts support a marriage with Skjöld, the founder of the Danish royal fam
ily known as the Skjöldungar in medieval Scandinavian tradition and the
Scyldingas in Old English. Her interaction with the giants would have been on
the order of other such human-supernatural interactions. However, many schol
ars have found themselves persuaded that Gefjon originally was a goddess. They
believe that her name has to do etymologically with gifts or giving and that she
was therefore a fertility deity, perhaps localized to Denmark. It is also possible
that her name was the source of a Finnish word meaning “bride’s outfit,
trousseau.” Finally, in some translations of the lives of the saints into medieval
Icelandic, the translator substituted the name of Gefjon for a pagan Roman god
or used it in a list of pagan Scandinavian gods where there was a list of pagan
Roman gods in the original text. Sometimes Diana is the Roman goddess in
question, and that has led to the idea that Gefjon’s split between virgin and
whore may have originated in an analogy with Diana.
The lack of the Gefjon/Gylfi story in one branch of the manuscripts of
Snorri’s Edda, and the fact that Gylfi is reintroduced directly after it in the other
manuscripts, suggests that it was not part of Snorri’s original text but may have
been added by a later scribe. If this passage is not from Snorri’s pen, it is possible
that whoever wrote it either knew about the Gefjon-Diana equivalence or took
the view of the pagan gods as demons and therefore made a whore out of Gefjon.
However, Lokasenna suggests that the notion of Gefjon’s sexual activity was
136 Norse Mythology



more widespread. Since having children with a giant is ordinarily inconceivable
for a goddess, as I have noted, perhaps in the end we must simply accept that
there were shifting, sometimes contradictory conceptions of Gefjon.
References and further reading: Two recent articles in English treat Gefjon: John Lindow, “The Two Skaldic Stanzas in Gylfaginning: Notes on Sources and Text History,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 92 (1977): 106–124, and Margaret Clunies Ross, “The Myth of Gefjon and Gylfi,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 93 (1978): 149–165.
GEFN
Name for Freyja.
Snorri says in Gylfaginning that Freyja has many names because she took on dif
ferent names among the various peoples she encountered when she went to
search for her missing husband, Ód. Gefn is listed as a Freyja name in Skáld
skaparmál and the thulur and turns up in kennings in skaldic poetry, but there
is no extant narrative in which Freyja bears the name. The meaning of the name
has to do with the verb “to give” and would therefore accord with the notion of
Freyja as a fertility deity.

GEIRRÖD
Giant visited by Thor, who killed the giant’s daughters.
The myth is known from the poem Thórsdrápa, by the skald Eilíf Godrúnarson,
about whom we only know that he was associated with the court of Hákon Sig
urdarson, jarl of Hladir toward the end of the tenth century and portrayed in the
sources as an enthusiastic pagan. Thórsdrápa is an extremely difficult poem, but
we have an account of the myth in Snorri Sturluson’s Skáldskaparmál, preced
ing the citation of the poem itself. It begins with Loki flying to Geirrödargardar,
the abode of the giant, in Frigg’s falcon coat. Captured by Geirröd and starved in
a locked chest for three months, Loki agrees to bring Thor there without his
hammer or belt of strength. Accompanied by Loki (Thjálfi in Thórsdrápa), Thor
comes first to the home of the giantess Gríd, the mother of Vídar the silent. She
warns him about Geirröd and equips him with a belt of strength, an iron glove,
and a staff called Grídarvöl (Gríd’s-staff). Thor sets out and arrives at Vimur,
greatest of all rivers. Wearing the belt of strength and bracing himself against the
current with the staff, Thor fights through deep waters. Then he sees that Gjálp,
the daughter of Geirröd, is standing astride the river and causing it to swell with
urine or menstrual fluids. Saying, “A river must be dammed at its source,” he
throws a rock and hits the target. At that moment he comes ashore and grabs a
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 137



rowan, which is why, Snorri says, the rowan is called “Thor’s protection.” At
Geirrödargardar he sits on a seat and finds that Geirröd’s daughters Gjálp and
Greip are pushing up from beneath, obviously trying to crush him against the
ceiling. He presses Grídarvöl against the ceiling and forces the chair down on the
girls, breaking their backs. Then Geirröd challenges him to a game in the hall.
Geirröd throws a piece of red-hot iron at Thor, who catches it in the iron glove.
Geirröd jumps behind a pillar, but Thor throws the piece of iron through the pil
lar, Geirröd, and the wall behind and into the earth.
Saxo Grammaticus tells in Book 8 of his Gesta Danorum of the visit of
Thorkillus to the vile hall of the dead Geruthus, where he and his companions
see the pierced body of an old man and three dead women with their backs bro
ken. Thorkillus tells them that Thor had driven a hot ingot through Geruthus
and killed his daughters with thunderbolts.
The myth shows several characteristics of Thor stories—the dangerous jour
ney to the otherworld, the special enmity of female giantesses, and the killing of
a male giant—and it also introduces notions of smithing that sometimes seem
to lurk behind Thor.
An entirely unrelated figure also bears the name Geirröd, in the eddic poem
Grímnismál.

GERD
Giantess wife of Frey.
Gerd is the daughter of the giants Gymir (Geyser according to one source) and Aur
boda. Frey caught sight of her from Odin’s seat, Hlidskjálf, fell in love with her,
and dispatched his servant Skírnir to woo her. Gerd yielded not to Skírnir’s blan
dishments but to his threatened curses, and a wedding was arranged for nine nights
later. Frey complained that this wait would be too long. However, Frey and Gerd
138 Norse Mythology



do appear to be married in the
mythological present. Frey gave
up his sword to obtain Gerd, and
without it he will be weaponless
when he faces Surt at Ragnarök.
Gerd’s name has been associ
ated etymologically with the earth
and with enclosures, and the wed
ding is often taken to be the divine
coupling of sky and earth, or at
least of fertility god and represen
tative of the soil. It can also be read
as a simple case of the gods getting
what they want from the giants.

GERI (RAVENOUS-ONE)
One of Odin’s wolves.
Grímnismál, stanza 19, part of
Odin’s vision of the abodes of the
gods, mentions Geri:
Geri and Freki the one accus
tomed to battle feeds,
Glorious Herjafödr [Odin];
And on wine alone the weapon
noble
Odin ever lives.
Snorri quotes this stanza in Gylfaginning and puts the two halves together,
saying that Odin gives his own food to the wolves, as he lives on wine alone.
The name is simply the definite form of an adjective.

GESTUMBLINDI (ONE-BLIND-TO-GUESTS?)
A name taken by Odin when he participates in a riddling contest in Hervarar saga ok
Heidreks konungs.
A man called Gestumblindi has been summoned by his enemy, King Heidrek.
Seeking help, he sacrifices to Odin. That night a stranger arrives at the door, says
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 139
Stamped gold foil from Helgö, Sweden, showing a
couple embracing. (Statens Historiska Museet,
Stockholm)



his name is Gestumblindi, and changes places with the original Gestumblindi.
This second Gestumblindi, clearly Odin in disguise, goes to Heidrek and elects
to propound riddles rather than to be judged by Heidrek’s wise men. “That is
right and proper,” says the king. Gestumblindi puts 30 riddles, and Heidrek eas
ily guesses the answer to the first 29. The answers refer mostly to household sit
uations and natural phenomena, but one is “the women of Ægir,” and the
twenty-ninth is “Odin riding Sleipnir.” The thirtieth is the unanswerable ques
tion that doomed Vafthrúdnir: What did Odin say into the ear of Baldr before he
was put on the funeral pyre? Heidrek now recognizes Odin and slashes at him
with a sword, but Odin flies off in the form of a hawk. He curses Heidrek, proph
esying that the worst slaves will kill the king, and this quickly comes to pass.
Despite the mostly mundane content of the riddles themselves, the story
fits the type of the contest of wisdom, several of which involve Odin in the
mythology. Vafthrúdnismál is the closest analogue, not just for the final ques
tion but also because the giant has wagered his head on the contest. In Grím
nismál Geirröd, the human king who fastened Odin in the fire and has been
listening to his ecstatic wisdom performance, falls onto his sword at the end of
the story and is thus killed. Both human kings suffer ignominious deaths.
References and further reading: Jan de Vries, “Om Eddaens visdomsdigtning,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 50 (1934): 1–19, treats the Gestumblindi story in association with eddic wisdom poetry.

GIMLÉ
Hall where people live after Ragnarök.
The main source is Völuspá, stanza 65, where the seeress, describing the situa
tion after Ragnarök, has this to say:
She sees a hall standing, fairer than the sun,
Thatched with gold, at Gimlé;
There shall trustworthy people dwell
And throughout all ages enjoy bliss.
Snorri Sturluson quotes the stanza in the Gylfaginning of his Edda, where
he mentions Gimlé three times. It appears that he thought of it, or perhaps more
accurately, wished the æsir to present it to Gylfi/Ganglier, as a kind of pagan
heaven.
140 Norse Mythology



GINNUNGA GAP
The primeval void that existed before the creation of the cosmos.
The major source is Völuspá, stanza 3:
It was early of ages, when Ymir dwelled,
There was not sand nor sea nor cool waves;
Earth did not exist nor heaven above,
Ginnunga gap existed, but no grass at all.
In Gylfaginning Snorri does not explain what Ginnunga gap was, but he uses
it in his creation story:
Those rivers which are called the Élivágar, when they had come so far from their
source that the fermentation that accompanied them there, hardened like the
slag that runs out of fires, as it was freezing, and when the ice stopped and froze
solid, then it was covered over with frost, and that drizzling rain which arose
from the poison, froze into frost, and the frost grew over all Ginnunga gap. . . .
That part of Ginnunga gap, which faced the north, was filled with a load and
heaviness of ice, and in from there drizzle and a gust of wind; and the southern
part of Ginnunga gap turned toward those sparks and embers, which flew out of
Muspellsheim. . . . Just as cold and all bad things came from Niflheim, all that
which came from Muspell was hot and bright, but Ginnunga gap was as calm as
a windless sky, and when the warm breeze met the frost, it melted and dripped.
And from those drops of poison life emerged, with the power that the heat sent,
and it grew into a human form, and that one is called Ymir, but the frost giants
call him Aurgelmir, and all the families of frost giants descend from him.
Later Snorri makes it clear that he understood Ginnunga gap as the center
of the universe, for it is there that the sons of Bor place the body parts of Ymir
to make the cosmos, and one of the roots of Yggdrasil runs where Ginnunga gap
used to be.
Formally, Ginnunga gap must be parsed as “Gap of ginnungs.” What gin
nungs are is not wholly clear, but the first syllable ginn- in mythological con
texts was used to intensify what followed, as in ginn-holy, “extremely holy,”
gods, or ginnregin, “great powers,” that is, the gods. At the same time, as a noun
(in poetry) ginn meant “falsehood, deception,” and there was a common verb
ginna, “deceive.” A gap of ginnungs, then, was probably a proto-space filled with
magic powers.
References and further reading: The meaning I propose in the last sentence is taken from Jan de Vries, “Ginnungagap,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 5 (1930): 41–66, reprinted in his Kleine Schriften, ed. Klaas Heeroma and Andries Kylstra (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1965), 113–132.

GÍSL
Horse name found in Grímnismál, stanza 30, which lists the horses the æsir ride
each day when they go to make judgments at Yggdrasil.
Snorri Sturluson includes Gísl in his list of the horses of the æsir in Gylfaginning
but does not assign the horse to any specific god. Gísl is also listed in the thulur
for horses. The name looks like the common noun for hostage, but etymologi
cally it can be connected with the word for “beam” or “ray,” which would make
more sense for a horse, especially one with a particularly shiny coat.
GJALLARBRÚ
Bridge that must be crossed on the way to Hel.
Our knowledge of the Gjallarbrú is derived almost exclusively from Snorri
Sturluson’s Gylfaginning, in the section of the Baldr myth describing the jour
ney of Hermód to Hel in an attempt to retrieve Baldr. After riding nine dark
nights, Hermód comes to the bridge, and there he has a conversation with
Módgud, the maiden who guards the bridge. That this bridge leads to the world
of the dead is made clear by their dialogue. She asks Hermód his name and fam
ily and informs him that although five troops of dead men rode over the bridge
yesterday, it resounds no less under Hermód alone. When she asks Hermód his
mission, he tells her and asks whether Baldr has come that way. He has, she
replies, and she tells him that the way to Hel lies down and north. Snorri adds
the puzzling detail that the bridge is all “roofed with bright gold.”
Gjallarbrú means “bridge of [i.e., over] Gjöll,” but we have little information
about this river. Earlier in Gylfaginning, when he cataloged the rivers flowing
from Hvergelmir, Snorri said that Gjöll is “closest to the gate of Hel,” but this
he may have got from his conception of Baldr’s journey. The wolf Fenrir is bound
by means of a flat rock called Gjöll, but there is no compelling reason to associ
ate the stone and the river.
The Gjallarbrú is found only once outside of Snorri in medieval Iceland,
namely in a verse by his nephew, Sturla Thórdarson, who once used the expres
sion “travel the Gjallarbrú” for “die.” But it also turns up several times in
Draumkvæde, a Norwegian ballad telling of the otherworld journey of one Olav
Åsteson, who fell asleep Christmas Eve and awoke on Epiphany having had a
vision of the fate of dead souls, including, among other things, a passage over the
forbidding bridge Gjallarbrú. Draumkvæde is known from numerous oral record
ings made in Telemark in the 1840s, but the vision it describes probably derives
from the high Middle Ages. Thus, the Gjallarbrú appears to be one of the few
pagan motifs to flourish in a Christian environment, obviously because a cruel
bridge to the other world figures frequently in medieval vision literature. How
142 Norse Mythology



ever, Snorri’s medieval audience could hardly have conceived of the Gjallarbrú
outside of the well-known visionary tradition. Perhaps Snorri covered the bridge
with gold to differentiate it somewhat from the bridges of medieval Christian
vision literature.

GJALLARHORN (SCREAMING-HORN)
Heimdall’s horn, sounded at the onset of Ragnarök.
The relevant source is Völuspá, stanza 46:
Mím’s sons sport, and the world tree trembles
At the old Gjallarhorn.
Loudly blows Heimdall, the horn is aloft,
Odin is speaking to Mím’s head.
In Gylfaginning Snorri paraphrases this verse and adds the information that
Heimdall blows the Gjallarhorn in order to awaken all the gods for a meeting to
deal with the oncoming forces of chaos.
Snorri had mentioned the Gjallarhorn twice previously in Gylfaginning. In
describing Heimdall, he has duly ascribed the horn to him, using the word for a
long brass instrument that would answer today to an unvalved trumpet. Heim
dall’s blast on it can be heard throughout the entire world. How odd it is, then,
that in the very first reference to the Gjallarhorn, Snorri refers to it as a drinking
horn and associates it with Mímir, who acquires wisdom by drinking from it out
of the well that is associated with him, the Mímisbrunn. The association, if
there is one, may be retrievable from stanzas 27 of Völuspá:
She knows that Heimdall’s hearing is hidden
Under the holy tree, accustomed to brightness;
She sees a river washed with a muddy waterfall
From the pledge of Valfödr—would you know yet more?
We know from various sources (including the next stanza of Völuspá), that
Odin pledged his eye in the well. If Heimdall’s hearing (ear?) is also pledged
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 143



there, as the stanza seems to suggest, he ought to have supernatural hearing, just
as Odin has supernatural vision. But what of the horn? Perhaps Snorri was influ
enced by Grímnismál, stanza 13, which says that Heimdall (not Mím) drinks
good mead at his hall, Himinbjörg. Or perhaps he simply turned the notion of
hearing inside out and imagined it as noise. Or perhaps this Gjallarhorn, like the
Gjallarbrú, is associated with the river Gjöll, which flowed from Hvergelmir,
like Mím’s well, a spring located near the center of the cosmos.

Gleerup, 1937), has a chapter devoted to the horn, but it follows an outmoded methodology and is highly speculative.
GJÁLP
Giantess, daughter of Geirröd, killed by Thor.
According to Snorri Sturluson writing in Skáldskaparmál, Gjálp was the giant
ess straddling the river Vimur and causing it to swell with urine or menstrual
fluids when Thor was trying to cross it on his way to Geirröd. Thor threw a rock
at her, saying, “A river must be dammed at its source,” and he hit the target.
Later he killed Gjálp and her sister Greip by breaking their backs beneath his
seat as they tried to push it up against the ceiling to crush him.
Gjálp is also found in stanza 37 of Hyndluljód, in the “Short Völuspá,”
where she is listed as one of the nine giant mothers of an unnamed character,
presumably Heimdall. Gjálp also turns up in the thulur and in kennings in
skaldic poetry. The meaning of the name may be something like “screamer.”

GLAD (GLAD)
Horse name found in Grímnismál, stanza 30, a stanza listing the horses the æsir ride
each day when they go to make judgments at Yggdrasil.
Snorri Sturluson includes Glad in his list of the horses of the æsir in Gylfagin
ning but does not assign the horse to any specific god. Glad is also listed in the
thulur for horses.
GLADSHEIM
One of the abodes of the æsir, described in Grímnismál, stanza 8, in the list of such
abodes.
144 Norse Mythology



Gladsheim is the fifth, where the gold bright
Valhöll lies widely situated;
And there Hropt [Odin] chooses each day
Weapon-dead men.
This would appear to be a larger place in which Valhöll is situated; that is,
it seems that Valhöll is a hall, perhaps one of many, at Gladsheim. Snorri knew
Grímnismál, so it is interesting to note that he says Gladsheim was a temple
erected at Idavöll by Alfödr, with 12 high seats: “That is the best and greatest
building made on earth; outside and inside it is like a single piece of gold.”
Although Gladsheim looks as though it should mean “Happy home,” Snorri may
therefore have understood it to mean “Gleaming home.”
See also Idavöll; Valhöll
GLÆR (GLASSY)
Horse name found in Grímnismál, stanza 30, a stanza listing the horses the æsir ride
each day when they go to make judgments at Yggdrasil.
Snorri Sturluson includes Glær in his list of the horses of the æsir in Gylfagin
ning but does not assign the horse to any specific god. Glær is also listed in the
thulur for horses.
GLEIPNIR
The fetter with which the wolf Fenrir was finally bound.
According to Snorri Sturluson in Gylfaginning, after Fenrir broke out of two pre
vious fetters, Lœding and Drómi, the æsir feared they would never be able to
bind the wolf.
Then Alfödr [Odin] sent Skírnir, Frey’s servant, down into the world of the dark
elves to some dwarfs and had that fetter made, which is called Gleipnir. It was
made of six things: cat noise, woman beard, mountain roots, bear sinews, fish
breath, and bird spittle. . . . The fetter was smooth and soft as a silk ribbon.
The wolf thought little renown could be won from breaking out of such a
bond, and he feared a trick, but he allowed himself to be bound with Gleipnir
when Ty ́r put his hand in the wolf’s mouth. Thus he was bound, and thus Ty ́r
lost his hand.

GLEN
Husband of Sól (Sun), according to Snorri Sturluson.
Writing in Gylfaginning, Snorri alludes to Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 23, which
personifies the sun and moon. But Snorri has a somewhat different and more
elaborate story: Mundilfœri is a man who had two children who were so beauti
ful that he named them Máni and Sól (i.e., Moon and Sun), and he married Sól
to a man called Glen. Thereafter the gods punished this act of pride by placing
the children in heaven to serve the actual heavenly bodies, which the gods had
created. Sól drives the horses that pull the sun, and Máni controls the motion of
the moon and its waxings and wanings.
I have paraphrased the text fairly closely. The implication that the act of
pride was marrying his daughter to Glen, and not naming one’s children Sun and
Moon, is right there in Snorri, but like most people I prefer to ignore it and think
that the gods punished Mundilfœri for the names and not the marriage. There is
certainly no evidence that Sól’s marriage to Glen annoyed the gods, for indeed
there is no other evidence whatever about this marriage. Glen is discussed in
passing in various reference works, and most writers make an effort to find an
appropriate etymology for his name, in one root or another having to do with
shining or gleaming.

GLITNIR
The hall of Forseti, Baldr’s son.
Glitnir is enumerated among the abodes of the æsir in Grímnismál, stanza 15:
Glitnir is the tenth. It is studded with gold
And thatched with silver as well.
And there Forseti dwells most of the day
And settles all lawsuits.
In Gylfaginning in his Edda Snorri Sturluson repeats this information.
See also Forseti
GNÁ
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists her fourteenth and last in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses
among the æsir and says that Frigg sends her into various worlds on errands. She
has a horse called Hófvarpnir (Hoof-thrower) that runs over air and sea. Snorri
146 Norse Mythology



now cites a strange verse exchange. Seeing her riding in the sky, vanir (why it
should be vanir is unclear) ask in verse what is flying there. She answers, “I am
not flying, / although I travel / and move through the sky / on Hófvarpnir /
whom Hamskerpir sired with Gardrofa.” The name Hamskerpir is not transpar
ent, and Gardrofa looks as though it should mean “Fence-breaker,” but these
horses and any myth connected with them are not known from any other source.
Snorri ends his discussion of Gná by saying that from her name what goes high
up is said to gnæfa (“to project”).
GNIPAHELLIR (GNIPA-CAVE)
Cave where the hound Garm is bound, in Völuspá, stanzas 44, 49, and 53, and in
the Gylfaginning of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda.
The meaning of the entire name is sometimes taken to be “overhanging cave.”
GODS, WORDS FOR
Terms used to designate the gods collectively in medieval Icelandic, especially in
the written texts of the mythology. This entry treats the individual terms other than
æsir, which has its own entry, and attempts to draw a few conclusions based on
general trends.
Probably the most commonly found term after æsir is goƒ or guƒ (both forms are
attested), which is obviously cognate with English “god.” Etymologically, the
word is usually understood as deriving from something like “one called on.” This
is the term that is used in translations of saints’ lives to render Latin deus with
the sense of pagan idol, and the sense of an idol is often found in the native Ice
landic literature as well. But in the mythological texts, the word appears to be
essentially interchangeable with æsir; that is, it is a plural and refers to the gods
as a group, usually including both æsir and vanir. It was used in the singular only
of the sun (the “shining god,” Grímnismál, stanzas 38–39, Sigrdrífumál, stanza
15). There are Odin kennings such as hanga-goƒ (god of the hanged) and hjaldr
goƒ (noise [i.e., of battle]-god), but such kennings could also be used of giants: stál
goƒ (steel-god, apparently Hrungnir), öndur-goƒ (snowshoe-god, i.e., Skadi), used
of her before her marriage to Njörd and entry into the community of the gods.
According to the principles of kenning formation, there is considerable freedom
in the use of such base words. What is far more striking is that goƒ was also used
in the singular to refer to the Christian god, but with masculine grammatical gen
der, not the original neuter grammatical gender of all other uses of the word.
Another term is regin, like goƒ grammatically a neuter plural noun. It is per
haps most familiar in the genitive plural form ragna, in Ragnarök (literally,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 147



“fates of the gods”), the term for the end of the reign of the gods and the demise
of the cosmos. Etymologically, regin appears to be derived from a root meaning
“to give counsel.” A runic inscription from around 600 C.E. has the word in a
compound that scholars read as “descended from the divine powers.” If this
interpretation is correct, then this word has quite a prehistory. Compounds like
reginkunnr, “descended from the gods,” are relatively clear in eddic poetry, but
in other cases the usage of the word as a prefix meaning “great” or “tremen
dous,” which is common in modern Icelandic (e.g., reginvitleysa, “great stupid
ity”), may be at work. Thus, does regindómr in Völuspá, stanza 65, mean
“tribunal of the gods, divine rule,” or something similar, or does it mean “great
judgment”? The regin-πing in Helgakvida Hundingsbana I appears simply to be
a great assembly, as there is no sign of the gods at this point in the poem.
An interesting aside to the above discussion, in which a “god” word is used
as an intensifier, is that “giant” words often fulfill this function, as in English
(e.g., “giant mistake”) or Swedish (jättekul, “way cool”).
The language of eddic poetry suggests that these terms are very nearly
synonymous:
Then all the regin went to the judgment seats,
The very holy goƒ, and considered that . . . (Völuspá, stanzas 6, 9, 23, and 25)
Hail æsir,
hail ásynjur [goddesses],
hail all the very holy goƒ. (Lokasenna, stanza 11)
Finally, there are two words that are transparently plurals meaning bonds
(bönd) or fetters (höpt), both again neuter. Both are limited to poetry, especially
skaldic poetry. Indo-European comparative mythology suggests that binding
gods were common. For the Germanic area, Tacitus states in Germania, chapter
39, that the Semnones, the “oldest and noblest of the Suebi,” conduct sacrifices
in a grove that no one enters unless bound by a chain. Anyone who falls must
somehow wiggle out of the grove without help. Some scholars think that the
mysterious Fjöturlund, “Fetter-grove,” of Helgakvida Hundingsbana II may be
related. The practice of the bravest warriors of another tribe, the Chatti,
described by Tacitus in chapter 31 of Germania, may also be relevant: Novice
warriors were not permitted to shave or groom themselves until they had first
slain an enemy; the bravest wore an iron ring in token of chains, to be removed
by the slaughter of an enemy.
In general, the presence of these various words for the collective of the gods
may serve to remind us that the vivid pictures of individual deities with various
148 Norse Mythology



personalities given by the mythological texts may not tell the whole story. The
collective of gods must also at some time have been a potent force.

Old Norse Word regin,” Journal of English and Germanic Philology 15 (1916): 251–266.
GREIP (GRIP)
Giantess, daughter of Geirröd, killed by Thor.
According to Snorri Sturluson writing in Skáldskaparmál, Greip was one of the
two daughters of Geirröd whom Thor killed by breaking their backs beneath his
seat as they tried to push it up against the ceiling to crush him.
Greip is also found in stanza 37 of Hyndluljód, in the “Short Völuspá,”
where she is listed as one of the nine giant mothers of an unnamed character,
presumably Heimdall. Greip is not found in the thulur, but she is used once in
a kenning in skaldic poetry.
See also Geirröd; Gjálp; Heimdall References and further reading: Lotte Motz, “Giantesses and Their Names,” Frühmittelalterliche Studien 15 (1981): 495–511.
GRÍD
Giantess who equips Thor on his journey to Geirröd, according to the Skáldskap
armál of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda.
Thor came to stay with that giantess who is called Gríd. She is the mother of
Vídar the silent. She told Thor about Geirröd, said he was an exceedingly wise
giant and difficult to deal with. She lent him her belt of strength, her iron glove,
and her staff, which is called Grídarvöl (Gríd’s-staff).
As the mother of Vídar the silent, Gríd is a consort of Odin, and this may
explain her willingness to help Thor. In the arrangement of this narrative, she
plays a role very like that of an old woman in a fairy tale who equips a hero with
information and things he needs. Folklorists call such a figure a donor and note
that it is a commonplace of folk narrative.

GRÍMNISMÁL
Eddic poem.
Grímnismál (Words of Grímnir) is found in both of the main manuscripts of
eddic poetry and is quoted extensively by Snorri Sturluson in Gylfaginning. In
Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda it is located between Vafthrúdnismál and Skír
nismál and was therefore probably regarded by the compiler as the last of the
Odin poems, perhaps because here Odin contends with a human king. It consists
of 54 stanzas, mostly in ljóƒaháttr; other stanzas are in galdralag, and some edi
tors set some stanzas as fornyrƒislag. The poem is preceded by a prose header
under the rubric “About the Sons of King Hraudung” and is followed by a prose
colophon.
The prose frame tells of two sons of King Hraudung, a name that turns up
as the father of Hjördís in Sigrdrífumál, stanza 26, and in the thulur as a sea
king. Agnar and Geirröd set out fishing but are blown out to a distant island
where a couple takes them in. The old woman fosters Agnar and the old man
Geirröd. In spring they return home, but Geirröd, following the old man’s whis
pered advice, pushes his older brother back out to sea. We learn that the old
couple were Frigg and Odin, and when Odin boasts that his foster son is a king
while Frigg’s is getting children on a giantess in a cave, Frigg counters that Geir
röd is stingy with food—a false accusation—and the couple make a bet. Frigg
sends Fulla to Geirröd to warn him of the impending visit of a man with magic
powers, and when Odin arrives, calling himself Grímnir (Masked-one), Geirröd
puts Grímnir in the fire. Geirröd’s son Agnar offers him a drink, and as the
flames lick higher the Masked One speaks. The first three stanzas relate to the
frame story: He has been eight nights in the fire and is grateful for the suste
nance from Agnar, who will become a king. With stanza 4 he begins a series of
visions of the dwellings of the gods, Thor at Thrúdheim, Ull at Y ́dalir, Frey at
Álfheim, and so forth. Stanzas 9 and 10 describe Valhöll, with its spear shafts,
shields, and byrnies within and a wolf and eagle outside. Eleven residences are
described, but in place of a twelfth, stanza 17 says that Vídar’s land grows with
brush and high grass. Stanzas 18–26 tell about life in Valhöll, including the food
of the einherjar, the many doors, and Heidrún and Eikthyrnir. Stanzas 27–30
catalog rivers and other bodies of water, and 31–35 describe Yggdrasil. Stanza 36
lists valkyries. Stanzas 37–39 are about the heavenly bodies. Stanzas 40–41 tell
of the creation of the cosmos from the body of Ymir. Stanza 42 calls down the
protection of Ull and may therefore be related to the frame. Stanzas 43–44 list
the best of things.
In stanza 45 Grímnir says, in galdralag, that he has revealed his face to æsir
and elves. In stanza 46 he begins to list his names, and these lead to an
epiphany.
150 Norse Mythology



Sword-weakened carrion
Ygg [Odin] will have now;
I know that your life has run its course;
the dísir are angry
now you can see Odin,
approach me if you can. (stanza 53)
“Odin I am named now,” he says to begin the last stanza, the final catalog
of his names.
According to the prose colophon, Geirröd arises to free Odin from the fire
but trips and falls on his sword. Odin disappears at that point, and Agnar enjoys
a long reign in his father’s place.
Outside of the frame, the core of the verses represent a catalog of mytholog
ical knowledge. This knowledge is largely cosmological and is the sort of thing
that is used in such eddic contests of wisdom as Vafthrúdnismál and Alvíssmál.
And although Geirröd does not exchange verses with Odin, he does die at the end
of the episode, thus sharing the fate of Vafthrúdnir and Alvíss. In short, there is
an implicit contest of wisdom here despite Geirröd’s silence. Thus, just as Odin
has triumphed over the giant Vafthrúdnir, so he triumphs over a human king.
There are, however, additional aspects that are of interest. Odin’s perform
ance is set off not only by his consumption of a drink, as is normal in contests
of wisdom, but also by his being hung in the fire. Here one thinks first of his self
sacrifice, as told in Hávamál. Pain and deprivation lead to the performance or
acquisition of wisdom. Without necessarily imagining Grímnismál to represent
a shamanic event, we may readily imagine that Odin’s verses, especially the cos
mological ones, report a vision.
Much of the recent discussion of the poem has centered around the rela
tionship of the prose to the verse and the frame to the catalog of mythological
knowledge. Whether the prose is late, or whether the frame and cosmological
catalogs were once separate entities, is not easy to discern. The poem is impos
sible to date, but it is not difficult to imagine something like it being performed
during the pagan period.

GROTTASÖNG
Eddic poem, spoken by two giant women who turn a magic mill and foretell the
demise of King Fródi of Denmark.
The poem is found only in manuscripts of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda, in the sec
tion called Skáldskaparmál. Snorri cites it after explaining the kenning “Fródi’s
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 151



flour” for gold. Skjöld, he says, was a son of Odin and the founder of the Skjöl
dung dynasty in Denmark. His son was Fridleif, and Fridleif’s son was Fródi.
Fródi ascended to the throne at the time Emperor Augustus had imposed peace
on the entire world when Christ was born, and this was called the Peace of Fródi
in Scandinavia. Fródi visited the Swedish king Fjölnir and purchased from him
two slave girls, Fenja and Menja, who were large and strong. At that time there
was a magic mill in Denmark, named Grotti, which no one had been strong
enough to operate. Fródi set the slaves to turning it and bade them grind out
gold, which they did, and also peace and prosperity for Fródi. But he did not
allow them rest, and finally they ground out an army against Fródi, led by the
sea king My ́sing. My ́sing killed Fródi and took much booty, and so ended the
peace of Fródi. My ́sing took the mill and the slaves and bade them grind salt. He
too allowed them no rest. A little later the ship sank, presumably through the
grinding of the slave girls, and that is why the sea is salty.
Although Fródi is descended from Odin, the story belongs to heroic legend.
The poem itself, which Snorri goes on to cite, is also a part of heroic legend, but
it approaches the mythology more closely because of the explicit association of
the slaves with the race of giants. In the very first stanza, the slaves are called
“prescient.” They grind away, contentedly at first, and they indeed grind gold,
prosperity, and even the Peace of Fródi (stanza 6). But Fródi will not let them
rest, and their good will evaporates. Stanzas 8 and 9 reveal that Fródi’s problem
has a mythological side.
8. You did not, Fródi, wisely guard your interests,
Eloquent friend of men, when you purchased slaves;
You chose on the basis of strength and appearance
But about family you did not enquire.
9. Hard was Hrungnir and his father,
Yet was Thjazi more powerful than they;
Idi and Aurnir, our kinsmen,
Brothers of mountain giants, to them we were born.
As girls they played beneath the earth, casting boulders about (stanza 11),
causing the earth to shake (12). Then they fought battles, deposed princes, helped
a hero, reddened blades (13–15). Now they are slaves of Fródi and are not pleased
with their lot. Grinding ever more fiercely, they see fire approach the stronghold
(19) and warn Fródi that he will not keep the throne of Hleiƒra (20). They grind
on, seeing the fates of men (21). The son of Yrsa and Hálfdan will avenge Fródi
(22). Their fearsome grinding grows, and in a giant rage, they destroy the mill.
The last stanza gives one of them the last word:
152 Norse Mythology



Still the mountain giant’s bride spoke words:
We have ground, Fródi, as we dared;
The women have completed the grinding.
The poem gives us the sense that the giants threaten humans as well as
gods, but that whereas the gods can mostly keep the giants in check, humans
cannot. The giants have great powers, but attempting to harness those powers
can be dangerous and destructive. Odin and the gods may be able to acquire pre
cious objects from the giants, but humans had better be very careful about such
matters.

GULLINBORSTI (GOLD-BRISTLE)
Frey’s boar; the boar Slídrugtanni.
In his account of Baldr’s funeral in Húsdrápa, composed circa 985 in western Ice
land, Úlf Uggason said that Frey arrived at the funeral riding a boar with golden
bristles, and this was presumably Gullinborsti (indeed, it is possible that the
name derived from this verse). When Snorri Sturluson gave his famous account
of the same funeral, he said that Gullinborsti pulled the cart in which Frey was
riding. In Hyndluljód, stanza 7, Freyja apparently refers to her friend (lover? pro
tégé?) Óttar as a boar, and the word gullinbusti follows, which most editors read
as the adjective “gold-bristled” rather than the name of Frey’s boar, since in the
following line, this boar is named Hildisvíni (Battle-pig). It is therefore possible
that both Frey and Freyja had a boar with golden bristles.
According to Snorri’s Skáldskaparmál, Gullinborsti was made by the dwarfs
Brokk and Eitri, in a wager with Loki, at the same time that other precious
objects for the gods were made. Snorri mentions in both Gylfaginning and Skáld
skaparmál that Gullinborsti had another name, Slídrugtanni.
Scholars understand the boar as associated with the fertility of the vanir but
also with the early Swedish kings.

GULLINTANNI (GILDED-TOOTH)
Name for Heimdall.
The name is given by Snorri when he describes Heimdall in the catalog of the
æsir in Gylfaginning, where he adds that Heimdall’s teeth were of gold. It is not
attested elsewhere, but in stanza 13 of his Gráfeldardrápa, a poem memorializ
ing Harald Greycloak, who died circa 974, the poet Glúm Geirason called gold
the “teeth of Hallinskídi,” using another of Heimdall’s names.
See also Gulltopp; Heimdall
GULLTOPP (GOLD-TOP)
Heimdall’s horse.
Gulltopp is listed as one of the horses of the æsir in Grímnismál, stanza 30, and
as a horse name in the thulur. Only Snorri assigns the horse to Heimdall. He
does so in his description of Heimdall in the catalog of æsir in Gylfaginning.
Snorri says that Gulltopp is one of the horses ridden by the æsir to daily judg
ments near Yggdrasil, but he does not associate the horse with Heimdall. In his
description of Baldr’s funeral, however, Snorri fills out his source, Úlf Uggason’s
Húsdrápa (which just says that Heimdall came riding), by stating that Heimdall
rode Gulltopp.
The name Gold-top could refer to a horse with a reddish-yellow mane, but
given that Heimdall himself is called Gullintanni (Gilded-tooth), we may per
haps be permitted to think of the precious metal.
See also Gullintanni; Heimdall
GULLVEIG
Mysterious female in Völuspá, stanzas 21–22, apparently associated with the war
between the æsir and vanir.
21. She remembers the war of peoples first in the world,
When Gullveig with spears they studded
And in Hár’s hall burned her;
Thrice burned, thrice born,
Often, unseldom, though she yet lives.
22. Heid they called her, wherever she came to houses,
A seeress skilled in prophecy, she observed magic staffs;
She performed seid, wherever she could, she performed seid in a trance,
She was ever the joy of an evil woman.
154 Norse Mythology



These stanzas are obscure, but it is hardly going too far to say that Gullveig
came to the hall of Odin (Hár), was attacked but could not be killed, and under
the name Heid went about performing seid. Since Ynglinga saga says that Freyja
first brought seid to the æsir, it is not impossible that Gullveig is Freyja, and that
she brought seid to the æsir in the first instance either as a strategy in the war,
or that her bringing of seid started the war. Beyond this, many fanciful attempts
have been made to interpret Gullveig, some based on a literal understanding of
her name as “gold-drink.”
See also Æsir-Vanir War; Freyja; Seid References and further reading: Heino Gehrts, “Die Gullveig-Mythe der Völuspá,” Zeitschrift für deutsche Philologie 88 (1969): 312–378, seeks a background in cult, which seems very speculative. An analysis based on myth is that of Ursula Dronke, “The War of the Æsir and Vanir in Völuspá,” in Idee Gestalt Geschichte: Festschrift Klaus von See, ed. Gerd Wolfgang Weber (Odense: Odense University Press, 1988), 223–238; Gullveig might, she thinks, have been some kind of idol burned by the æsir because Freyja, a woman, led the vanir in battle. In her Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Icelandic Society, vol. 1: The Myths (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), Margaret Clunies Ross suggests that Gullveig/Freyja was sent by the vanir, perhaps as a possible sexual partner, and rejected by the æsir because they did not take wives from lower social groups, and that their vehement reaction, the attempt to kill her, may have precipitated the war.
GUNGNIR
Odin’s spear.
Like Sif’s golden hair, Frey’s ship Skídbladnir, Odin’s ring Draupnir, Frey’s
golden boar, and Thor’s hammer, Gungnir was made by the dwarfs. Although it
is not specifically named as Gungnir, Odin throws a spear over an opposing
army, was “wounded with a spear and given to Odin, myself to myself,” when
he hung on the tree in his self-sacrifice according to Hávamál, stanza 138, and
had himself marked with a spear when he died, as did Njörd, according to the
historicized account of the æsir in the early chapters of Ynglinga saga. Skalds
call Odin the lord and god of the spear.

GUNNLÖD
The giantess seduced by Odin when he obtained the mead of poetry.
The story is told allusively in Hávamál, stanzas 108–110, and at length by Snorri
Sturluson in the Skáldskaparmál of his Edda. Hávamál 108 says,
I doubt that I would yet have come
Out of the giants lands,
If I had not had use of Gunnlöd, the good woman,
Around whom I put my arm.
Snorri has Odin, in the form of a snake, gain access to Gunnlöd in her father
Suttung’s mountain abode Hnitbjörg, where Suttung has set her to guard the
mead. Odin sleeps with her for three nights, and she permits him three drinks of
the mead. With that she leaves the story.
Gunnlöd looks as though it ought to mean “Battle-invitation,” which would
be a better valkyrie name than giant name.

GYLLIR
Horse name found in Grímnismál, stanza 30, a stanza listing the horses the æsir ride
each day when they go to make judgments at Yggdrasil.
Snorri Sturluson includes Gyllir in his list of the horses of the æsir in Gylfagin
ning but does not assign the horse to any specific god. Gyllir is also found listed
in the thulur for giants, perhaps because the name could mean “Yeller” as well
as the appropriate horse name, “Golden.”
GYMIR
Father of Gerd, the giantess who married Frey; possibly also identical with Ægir.
Gymir is indeed identified as the father of Gerd, and Aurboda as his wife and her
mother, in Skírnismál. In the Gylfaginning in his Edda, Snorri Sturluson repeats
this information, adding that Aurboda was of the lineage of mountain giants. In
Skáldskaparmál, however, in a discussion of kennings for the sea, Snorri quotes a
verse by the skald Ref Gestsson and then says that Ægir and Gymir are one and the
same. Ref was an eleventh-century skald quite given to mythological kennings, and
the verse in question seems to say that the cold seeress of Gymir often transports
the bear of twisted lines into the jaw of Ægir; that is, that the wave (Ægir’s daugh
ters are the nine waves) often drives a ship deep into the water. The prose header to
Lokasenna also says that Ægir was also known as Gymir, and if he was, the in-law
relationship with Frey might explain his well-known banqueting with the gods.

HÁBRÓK (HIGH-PANTS)
Best of hawks, according to Grímnismál, stanza 44.
This stanza comprises a list of the best of various things: Odin of the æsir, Sleipnir
of horses, and so forth. Although Snorri Sturluson quotes this stanza in Gylfagin
ning, he has nothing more to say of Hábrók, and the other sources are silent as well,
except for the thulur, which list the name under “hawk” and “rooster.”
“High-pants” could refer to long legs.
HADDINGJAR
Royal family in heroic literature; when doubled, possible reflex of the divine twins.
The prose colophon to Helgakvida Hundingsbana II says the ancients believed
in rebirth, and that Helgi Hundingsbani was thought to have been reborn as
Helgi Haddingja skati, that is, prince of the Haddingjar. The so-called Kálfsvísa,
a fragmentary list of horses and riders, says that Haddingja skati rode Skævad, a
horse name known from other sources.
Haddingjar is the plural of Haddingi (related perhaps to Hadingus in Saxo),
and the name is attested most interestingly as a doublet. Hyndluljód, stanza 23,
mentions “two Haddingjar,” as does a verse spoken by Hjálmar in Örvar-Odds
saga before the battle of Samsey. Another of the fornaldarsögur, Hervarar saga
ok Heidreks konungs, also names “two Haddingjar,” brothers of the hero
Anganty ́r. There thus appears to have been a tradition of a doubled Haddingi, and
some observers have associated them with the divine twins, especially since
according to tradition each was powerless on his own but together they made up
a strong warrior.

HADINGUS
Danish king in Book 1 of Saxo’s Gesta Danorum; shows remarkable similarities to
both Odin and Njörd.
Hadingus (sometimes referred to in the secondary literature as Haddingus or
Hadding because the Scandinavian form would have had -dd-) is the son of Gram
and descendant of the first Danish kings but raised by giants. He becomes the
lover of his nursemaid, the giantess Harthgrepa, who travels with him disguised
as a man and performs necromancy with him. After she is torn apart by other
giants, an old man with only one eye puts Hadingus in touch with the pirate
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 157



Liserus, and when Hadingus is wounded he makes an otherworld journey on a
horse (Sleipnir?). Later he makes a second otherworld journey when an old
woman transports him to the world of the dead. Before an important battle,
Hadingus puts his ship ashore to confer with an old man waving his cloak and
learns from him the secret of the wedge formation. And when he learns that
Hundingus, whom he had put on the throne at Uppsala, had drowned in a vat of
beer, Hadingus hanged himself before the eyes of his populace.
The partnership with a giantess, otherworld journeys, necromancy, wedge
formation, and voluntary hanging make it clear that Hadingus had obvious
Odinic associations, and indeed the story of Odin and Mithothyn is inserted into
the life of Hadingus with no discernible association. And yet there are very
strong associations with Njörd as well. Hadingus’s wife Regnhild chooses him
after an examination of the lower legs of the men assembled at a banquet. Hadin
gus had saved her from marriage to a giant, and though ignorant of his identity,
while nursing him back to health she had put a ring in a leg wound. Recogniz
ing this token, she chooses him. Even if this motif seems only distantly related
to Skadi’s choosing of Njörd by his lower legs, the other parallel is spot on:
Hadingus complains, in verse, of life away from the sea, and Regnhild complains
of life at the shore. And their complaints echo those of the verses cited in
Snorri’s Gylfaginning: Hadingus is disturbed by the howls of wolves, and Regn
hild by the crying of seagulls.
One other motif captures perfectly the way Hadingus combines aspects of
Odin and Njörd. One of his acts was to sacrifice to Frey. Indeed, he is said to have
established an annual sacrifice to Frø (Frey), “The Swedes call it Frøblot,” Saxo
says, using the Norse word blót. In the Learned Prehistory, it was Odin who
established sacrifices and was especially associated with the blót, but Frey car
ried on the tradition and was of course a member of the vanir and Njörd’s son.

isches Sakralkönigtum, vol. 1: Der Runenstein von Rök und die germanische Individualweihe (Tübingen: M. Niemeyer, 1952). For the Njörd side, see
Georges Dumézil, From Myth to Fiction: The Saga of Hadingus, trans. Derek Coltman (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1973). Dumézil argues that Hadingus passes through all three functions and ends as an Odin hero, just as Njörd himself passed from the vanir to the æsir.
HÁKONARMÁL
Skaldic praise poem attributed to Eyvind Finnsson skáldaspillir (Spoiler- or Debaser
of-poets; often understood to mean plagiarist), following the death of the Norwegian
king Hákon the Good at the battle of Stord, Norway, in 961.
158 Norse Mythology



The poem’s 21 stanzas are found in manuscripts of Snorri’s Heimskringla, and
some are also cited in Snorri’s Edda and in the kings’ saga synoptic manuscript
Fagrskinna. According to that manuscript, Eyvind composed the poem in direct
imitation of Eiríksmál, the anonymous poem describing the entry of Hákon’s
brother Eirík Bloodax into Valhöll.
Hákonarmál consists of two scenes followed by four stanzas of praise for the
fallen king. The first scene describes the battle, which we know from the very
first stanza is being observed by valkyries. Exhorting his men, Hákon tears off
his armor before the battle. His sword cuts through armor as if through water,
and swords glow in wounds. But now the valkyrie Göndul speaks: It is time to
depart for Valhöll. The forces of the gods have grown, now that Hákon and his
army are to join them. Hákon asks why the battle turned out as it did, and the
valkyrie Skögul responds that the valkyries gave Hákon victory and will now
transport him to the green world of the gods. Now the scene shifts to Valhöll.
Odin bids Hermód and Bragi greet the king. Hákon, covered with gore, expresses
concern about Odin’s ill will but is assured that he has the sanctuary of all the
einherjar. “Thus it was known, how well that king had spared the holy places,
when all the gods bade Hákon welcome” (stanza 18). The final two stanzas are
quite lovely:
20. Unbound through the homes of men
The wolf will run,
Before on the abandoned path
An equally good king will come.
21. Cattle die, kinsmen die,
Country and land are laid waste
Since Hákon went among the pagan gods,
The people are much oppressed.
As the final line indicates, the poem must have had a direct political purpose,
presumably to comment unfavorably on the rule of Harald gráfeld (Greycloak),
who succeeded Hákon. Such comment would especially have suited the interests
of the Hladir jarls (the rulers of the area around Trondheim), with whom the poet
Eyvind was associated. The beginning of the final stanza echoes very famous lines
from the gnomic section of Hávamál, and although the relationship between the
two poems remains unknown, the effect is certainly powerful here.
Like the Eiríksmál, Hákonarmál is a document that can be specifically
assigned to late paganism. Although Odin is the central deity in both poems, the
attitudes toward him are strikingly different. In Eiríksmál he chooses that the
king should die to build up the army of the gods, but in Hákonarmál the
valkyries appear to make the choice (in stanza 13, Skögul says that they should
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 159



ride off to inform Odin of what has transpired), and Hákon is suspicious of Odin.
Except for Odin, only former human heroes appear in Eiríksmál’s Valhöll, but
Hermód, presumably a god rather than a human hero, appears there in Hákon
armál. Finally, Hákonarmál uses a number of the collective words for gods (e.g.,
bönd, regin). As Eirík had Danish connections and died in England, whereas
Hákonarmál appears to have been intended for consumption in the circles of the
Hladir jarls, what we are seeing may be variation in regional belief, but it may
be no more than variation that is to be expected from the work of two different
poets working in different political circumstances.

The literary relationship between Eiríksmál and Hákonarmál is discussed by Klaus von See, “Zwei eddische Preislieder,” in Festgabe Ulrich Pretzel m 65. Geburtstag dargebracht von seinen Freunden und Schülern, ed.
Walter Simon, Wolfgang Bachofer, and Wolfgang Dittmann (Berlin: Schmidt, 1963), 107–117. Edith Marold, “Das Walhallbild in den Eiríksmál und Hákonarmál,” Mediaeval Scandinavia 5 (1972): 19–33, acknowledges that the portrait of Valhöll in Hákonarmál is darker and conceivably more archaic than that of Eiríksmál and analyzes especially the duality of the conceptions in Hákonarmál.
HÁLEYGJATAL
Fragmentary genealogical poem, attributed to Eyvind Finnsson skáldaspillir (Spoiler
or Debaser of poets; often understood to mean plagiarist).
The poem one finds in modern editions consists of 16 stanzas and half-stanzas
assembled by editors from manuscripts of Snorri’s Edda, Heimskringla, and two
other manuscripts of kings’ sagas. It is in kviƒuháttr, the meter used by Thjódólf
of Hvin for his Ynglinga tal, and although the text is difficult in places, it
appears, like that poem, to enumerate the deaths of a line of kings, in this case
of Hálologaland, the area of Norway north of Trondheim. It is usually assumed
that the poem was intended to provide for the Hladir jarls, that is, the rulers of
the Trondheim area, the genealogical link to the pagan gods that Ynglinga tal
provided for the kings of the Oslo fjord region. Eyvind had been a court poet of
one of those kings, Hákon the Good, but by the end of the tenth century he was
working for the Hladir jarls, and he composed Háleygjatal for Hákon jarl after
the jarl’s victory over the Jómsvikings in 985.
The extant stanzas appear to make Odin and Skadi, while they were living
160 Norse Mythology



in Manheim, the progenitors of the rulers, although one stanza uses the kenning
for earth, “bride of slaughter-Ty ́r” (Odin is the slaughter-Ty ́r, or slaughter-god,
and his “bride” was Jörd, or earth). According to Ynglinga tal Njörd and Skadi
lived at Manheim, and one would to be tempted to assume that the poet is refer
ring to Njörd and not Odin here in Háleygjatal were it not for the explicit state
ment that Skadi had many children with Odin.

HALLINSKÍDI
Name of Heimdall associating him with the ram.
Snorri gives Hallinskídi as a name for Heimdall, and the thulur list it as a name
for ram. In a late-tenth-century skaldic stanza, gold is called the “teeth of
Hallinskídi,” which accords with the general association between Heimdall and
gold words. Varying attempts have been made to explain the name Hallinskídi,
associating it with horns bent backwards, a stony peak or cranium, crooked
teeth, and even skates and skis, but all smack of desperation.

HÁRBARDSLJÓD
Eddic poem.
Hárbardsljód (Song of Hárbard) is retained in Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda
and, from near the end of stanza 19, in AM 748. In Codex Regius it is found
between Skírnismál and Hymiskvida, which probably means that the organizer
of Codex Regius regarded it as a Thor poem, although the title, which is found
in a rubric, refers to the Odin name Hárbard (Greybeard), and in the course of the
poem, Odin gets the upper hand. As edited, the poem consists of 60 stanzas; the
dominant meter is ljóƒaháttr, but numerous stanzas appear to be in fornyrƒislag
or even alliterative metrical prose. The poem is a dialogue, an exchange of boasts
and insults, between Thor and a disguised Odin.
The frame centers on Thor’s attempt to be ferried across a sound while
returning from one of his trips to the east. Thor insultingly calls to the ferryman
for transport over the water, but the ferryman upbraids the traveler and even
tells him that his mother is dead (stanza 4); taken literally, this is an allusion to
Ragnarök, for Thor’s mother is Jörd (Earth). Thor is nonplused, but soon asks
who owns the ferry (stanza 7). “Hildólf” (Battle-wolf) replies the ferryman
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 161



(stanza 8). The name is found among the thulur as a son of Odin, but Thor does
not react to it. When asked his own name (stanza 8), Thor announces three gen
erations of his lineage: son of Odin, father of Meili. “Here you can see Thor.”
The expression “Here you can see” is precisely what Odin says to Geirröd in the
epiphany at the end of Grímnismál when Odin terrifyingly reveals his identity
to the human King Geirröd, but on the ferryman it has no effect. Thor lamely
asks the ferryman what his name is. Odin’s response is deeply ironic. “I am
called Hárbard, / seldom I conceal my name” (stanza 10).
Having named themselves, the two return to the original question: Will
Thor get a ride across the sound? When Odin makes it clear that Thor will get
no such ride, the two settle into a series of questions and answers. These are to
be regarded as a mannjafnaƒr, “comparison of men,” a form of verbal dueling in
which one boasts about oneself and, often, tries to top the opponent’s previous
boast. Thor boasts of his battles with giants and mentions such well-known
myths as his killing of Hrungnir (stanza 15) and Thjazi (stanza 19), as well as
some incidents about which we are not well informed, such as, for example, a
battle with the “sons of Svárangr” (stanza 29). Odin’s boasts are more varied, but
they very frequently refer to his seductions. Thor seems nonplused by Odin’s
boasts about such a subject, and he often replies rather lamely. Twice he accuses
Hárbard of ergi (sexual perversion), but in a vexed rather than forceful way. Odin
declines Thor’s direct order in stanza 53 to row to shore and transport Thor, and
he has the last word when he ends the poem by saying to Thor, “Go now where
all evil things may have you.”
In Hárbardsljód, then, the two major gods have a verbal duel. Each plays to
his strengths in the actual boasts, but Odin is a master of verbal dueling, and he
emerges the clear winner, despite the apparent disadvantage that boasts about
sexual conquests ought to have in comparison with boasts about warlike deeds
of cosmic importance. The poem serves to order the two main gods on the basis
of verbal skills. In other eddic poems, Odin establishes his superiority over the
wisest of giants (Vafthrúdnismál) and a human king (Grímnismál). Here he does
the same with the strongest of gods.

162 Norse Mythology



HARTHGREPA (HARD-GRIP)
Giantess nursemaid, lover, and companion of Hadingus in Book 1 of Saxo’s Gesta
Danorum.
Harthgrepa is one of the two giants who raised Hadingus, a Danish king with
numerous Odinic traits (and not a few that associate him with Njörd). Certainly
tarrying with a giantess is an Odinic act, but Hadingus was only able to bring
himself to do so after Harthgrepa explained that as a giantess she could change
her shape at will. Thereafter they travel together, she disguised as a man, and
when they come upon a corpse she has Hadingus place a stick carved with spells
(in runes?) under its tongue, thereby initiating him into another of Odin’s
realms, necromancy. Her name is explained when, as she and Hadingus are shel
tering in a cave, a huge hand tries to enter. Swelling herself back up to great size,
she grasped the hand for Hadingus to chop off. She paid for this offense against
her own race subsequently when she was torn apart by them.
The Norse equivalent of Harthgrepa, Hardgreip, is listed in the thulur for
giantesses but is otherwise unknown.
See also Hadingus
HATI HRÓDVITNISSON
Wolf; precedes the sun in the sky and will swallow it or the moon.
Grimnismál, stanza 39, tells of the wolves who threaten the sun:
Sköll is the name of a wolf who accompanies the shining god
As a defense of the forest;
And the other Hati, he is the son of Hródvitnir,
That one shall be before the bright bride of heaven.
These lines are enigmatic. Snorri paraphrased them as follows in Gylfaginning:
Gangleri said: “The sun moves fast, and almost as if she were frightened; she
would not hasten her journey more, if she feared her death.” Then Hár answers:
“It is not surprising that she goes quickly. The one who seeks her is right
nearby, and she has no other way out than to run away.” Then Gangleri said:
“Who is it who makes this trouble?” Hár says: “It is two wolves, and the one
who chases her is Sköll; she is afraid of him, and he will take her, and the one
who runs in front of her is called Hati Hródvitnisson, and he will take the
moon.
I rendered the last word of this passage “moon,” although it can mean either
sun or moon. Clearly Snorri has adapted these wolves to his notion of Ragnarök,
when Garm will bay and Fenrir will get loose to slay Odin.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 163



Many scholars accept that Hati’s father Hródvitnir is the Hródrsvitnir men
tioned in Lokasenna, stanza 39. Either name (or both forms of the name) would
mean something like “famous wolf.” In Lokasenna that famous wolf is clearly
the wolf Fenrir. We have, however, no other indication that Fenrir had offspring,
and since he was bound from an early age until Ragnarök, we may wonder.
The name Hati also appears in Helgakvida Hjörvardssonar. In a prose sec
tion between stanzas 11 and 12, we learn that Helgi killed “Hati the giant,” and
in stanza 17 Hati’s son identifies himself:
I am called Hrímgerd, Hati was the name of my father,
I know him to have been the most powerful giant;
Many women he had abducted from farms
Until Helgi killed him.
Probably the two creatures who bore the name Hati were not identical, but
each was hateful. This is wholly appropriate: Hati probably meant something
like “hater.”

HÁVAMÁL
Eddic poem (Words of the High One).
Hávamál is the second poem in Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, located
between Völuspá and Vafthrúdnismál. The “High One” of the poem’s title is
Odin. The poem breaks clearly into several parts. The first 80 or so stanzas con
sist of a set of maxims. These range from the very mundane (Be careful when you
travel; Don’t drink too much) to beautiful stanzas that have often been taken to
present some kind of heroic ideal:
76. Cattle die,
kinsmen die,
one dies oneself in the same way,
but a reputation
never dies
for the one who acquires a good one.
77. Cattle die,
kinsmen die,
one dies oneself in the same way.
I know one thing
that never dies
the judgment of each dead person.
164 Norse Mythology



Stanzas 96–110 are sometimes called “Odin’s examples.” Two “examples”
are offered: the story of Billing’s girl and the story of Odin’s seduction of
Gunnlöd in connection with his acquisition of the mead of poetry. Stanzas
111–137 comprise the Loddfáfnismál. Stanzas 138–145 tell of Odin’s self-sacri
fice; this section is sometimes called Rúnatal (Enumeration of Runes) because
Odin acquires runes in it. Stanzas 146 to the end of the poem are sometimes
called the Ljódatal (Enumeration of Chants).
Although the poem obviously has material that relates directly to paganism
as well as to the mythology, and older scholarship often sought to reconstruct
forms that could have existed during the Viking Age or even earlier, today there
is a tolerable consensus that Hávamál as we have it is a medieval artifact and
that its organization, current form, and even language in some cases is the work
of a late-twelfth- or thirteenth-century redactor. For that reason I have chosen to
treat the pieces separately in this book. There are separate entries for Billing’s
Girl, Loddfáfnismál, and the Ljódatal. The second of the “Odin’s examples,” his
seduction or rape of Gunnlöd, is treated in the entry Mead of Poetry, and the self
sacrifice is treated in the entry Odin.

HEID
Name taken by Gullveig, according to Völuspá, stanzas 21–22, when she begins
practicing seid:
21. She remembers the war of peoples first in the world,
When Gullveig with spears they studded
And in Hár’s hall burned her;
Thrice burned, thrice born,
Often, unseldom, though she yet lives.
22. Heid they called her, wherever she came to houses,
A seeress skilled in prophecy, she observed magic staffs;
She performed seid, wherever she could, she performed seid in a trance,
She was ever the joy of an evil woman.
In the sagas Heid is a common name for seeresses, and it is also found in a
genealogy in Hyndluljód, stanza 33, of Hrímnir’s kin, presumably giants. The
adjective heid, “gleaming,” and the noun heid, “honor,” would suit nicely here
as well.

Deities, Themes, and Concepts 165



HEIDRÚN
Goat who bites the foliage of Lærad, the tree at Valhöll.
Grímnismál, stanza 25, is the most important source:
25. Heidrún is the name of the goat, who stands at the hall of Herjafödr [Odin]
And bites from the limbs of Lærad.
She will fill a barrel with the bright mead;
That drink can never run out.
In Gylfaginning Snorri Sturluson paraphrased these lines.
That goat, who is called Heidrún, stands up on Valhöll and bites foliage off the
limbs of that tree, which is famous and which is called Lærad. From her teats
runs that mead, with which she fills a barrel each day; it is so much, that all the
einherjar get fully drunk on it.
Thus Snorri draws Heidrún into the notion of the endless feasting of the ein
herjar, making her a parallel to Sæhrímnir, the boar who is cooked each day and
is whole again by evening.
Heidrún is found in one other place in eddic poetry, namely, the closing
stanzas of Hyndluljód. The frame of the poem is a dialogue between Freyja and
Hyndla, who appears to be a giantess, and in the end the exchanges are increas
ingly acerbic. After the “Short Völuspá” has ended, Freyja asked for some sort of
“memory-beer” to be brought for her boar (who is perhaps Óttar, her protégé).
Hyndla responds with two stanzas:
46. Turn away from here! I desire to sleep;
You’ll get little of fair opportunities from me;
You run about, noble friend, out at nights,
As if with he-goats Heidrún were traveling.
47. You ran up to Ód ever howling,
You jumped quickly into the sheets,
You run about, noble friend, out at nights,
As if with he-goats Heidrún were traveling.
Accusations of sexual forwardness are nothing new for Freyja, but adding
lasciviousness to the slender dossier of Heidrún changes it considerably and
stresses the intoxicating nature of the beer that flows from her. She would thus
seem to be less a nurturer and more associated with the Odinic side of the activ
ities at Valhöll. This would seem to me to negate the idea advanced by some of
the older scholarship that Heidrún should have a connection with fertility ritual
166 Norse Mythology



or even, I think, that the first syllable in her name should have referred to the
mead consumed at cult events, as some of the handbooks and encyclopedias
report. The etymology of the name is unknown, although that first syllable
would probably have been understood in Viking and medieval Scandinavia as
“bright.” Although the second syllable is identical with the noun “rune,” no one
would have understood it as such, since many common names use it (e.g.,
Gudrún).
See also Eikthyrnir; Freyja; Hyndluljód References and further reading: There is no study limited to Heidrún. The notion that Heid- means “sacrificial mead” was, as far as I know, advanced by Jan de Vries in his Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 19561957), still the standard handbook of Germanic religion despite its relative age. Readers who thirst for more about Heidrún’s mead may wish to consult Stefán Einarsson, “Some Parallels in Norse and Indian Mythology,” in Scandinavian Studies: Studies Presented to Dr. Henry Goddard Leach on the Occasion of His Eighty-Fifth Birthday, ed. Carl F. Bayerschmidt and Erik J. Friis (Seattle: University of Washington Press for the American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1965), 21–26, but what they find will be abbreviated and speculative.
HEIMDALL
Important but enigmatic god, the “guardian of the gods” and perhaps a boundary
figure.
Snorri has this to say of Heimdall in his catalog of the æsir in Gylfaginning:
One is called Heimdall. He is called White-god. He is large and holy. Nine maid
ens, all sisters, bore him. He is also called Hallinskídi and Gullintanni (Gilded
teeth); his teeth were made of gold. His horse is called Gulltopp (Gold-top). He
lives at Himinbjörg near Bilröst. He is the guardian of the gods and sits there at
the end of heaven to guard the bridge from mountain giants. He needs less sleep
than a bird. Night and day he sees a hundred leagues away; he also hears it when
grass grows on the earth or wool on sheep or anything else that can be heard. He
has a trumpet called the Gjallarhorn, whose blast can be heard in all the worlds.
In Skáldskaparmál Snorri adds more tantalizing information when he tells
how kennings can be made for Heimdall:
By calling him the son of nine mothers or guardian of the gods, as was written
above, or White-god, enemy of Loki, seeker of Freyja’s necklace. A sword is
called the head of Heimdall; it is said that he was struck against a man’s head.
That is treated in the poem Heimdalargaldr, and thereafter the head is called
fate of Heimdall; the sword is called fate of man. Heimdall is the owner of Gull

topp. He is also the visitor to Vágasker (Wave-skerry) and Singastein, when he
fought with Loki for the Brísinga men. He is also called Vindhlér (Wind-shelter).
Úlf Uggason versified for a long time in Húsdrápa about this story, and it is said
that they were in the form of seals. He is also the son of Odin.
We have one fragment from the poem Heimdalargaldr, quoted by Snorri in
Gylfaginning right after the passage just translated. In it the god himself speaks,
saying that he is the son of nine mothers and the son of nine sisters. This must
have been a poem in which Heimdall told of his life and exploits, and it would
have been nice to have more of it preserved, for we understand only very imper
fectly why a head should be called Heimdall’s sword. Was the blow with the
head fatal? Did Heimdall have nine lives, one for each mother? If he died from
the head blow, how can he still be around in the mythological present? Several
sources say that he will sound the Gjallarhorn at the onset of Ragnarök, and
168 Norse Mythology
This figure with its imposing horn, from a stone cross on the Isle of Man, recalls Heimdall and
the Gjallarhorn. (Werner Forman/Art Resource)



Snorri adds in Gylfaginning that Heimdall and Loki will square off in the final
battle and that they will kill each other.
Snorri’s statement to the effect that Úlf Uggason versified extensively about
the previous battle between Heimdall and Loki points out another sad loss, for
only one stanza has survived. Thus the myth of a possible loss or theft of the
Brísinga men and its recovery by Heimdall is forever lost to us.
We do have some potential information on Heimdall’s mothers, but it is
conflicting. In Skáldskaparmál Snorri speaks of the nine daughters of Ægir and
Rán. These fulfill the condition of being sisters, and since many of them bear
names meaning or associated with the waves of the sea, Heimdall could some
how be the daughter of nine waves. Alternatively, he may be the one referred to
in stanzas 35–38 of Hyndluljód, in the “Short Völuspá.”
35. A certain one was born in days of yore,
With greatly increased power, of the race of gods;
Nine bore him, a man full of grace [?],
Giant maidens on the edge of the earth. .................
37. Gjálp bore him, Greip bore him,
Eistla bore him and Eyrgjafa,
Úlfrún bore him and Angeyja,
Imdr and Atla and Járnsaxa.
38. That one was increased by the might of the earth,
Of the wave-cold sea and the blood of a sacrificial boar.
Many of these names are those of known giantesses. Thor killed Gjálp and
Greip and got Magni on Járnsaxa. Given Odin’s propensity for dallying with
giantesses, this lot would fit the notion of Odin as the father of Heimdall, even
if it cannot be demonstrated that they are sisters. It would be nice if the birth
place “on the edge of the earth” and the “wave-cold sea” could be associated
with Ægir’s daughters, but no one has yet figured out how to do so successfully.
Perhaps there were two traditions about Heimdall’s mothers.
The son of nine mothers, Heimdall is also, according to the prose header to
the eddic poem Rígsthula, the progenitor of the social classes of humans. This
prose states that Heimdall was traveling and came to a settlement by a coast,
where he called himself Ríg. The poem goes on to tell how Ríg is entertained at
three households, where he spends time in his hosts’ beds. The results are slaves,
farmers, and nobles. Possibly related to this is the request of the seeress in
Völuspá for a hearing, in the first stanza of the poem.
I ask for a hearing of all the holy races
Greater and lesser, kinsmen of Heimdall.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 169



The notion of Heimdall as guardian of the gods is not limited to Snorri.
Grímnismál, stanza 13, which Snorri quoted in Gylfaginning in connection with
his description of Heimdall cited above, uses the expression, and Loki’s some
what strange insult, in Lokasenna, appears to refer to it:
Shut up, Heimdall! For you in days of yore
An ugly life was allotted:
With a dirty wet back you will ever be
And wake, guardian of the gods.
If the “dirty wet back” has to do with being out in all weathers, then per
haps the name Vindhlér has to do with the same idea.
Heimdall’s preternatural hearing may be the subject of an obscure verse in
Völuspá, stanza 26.
She knows that Heimdall’s hearing is hidden
Under the holy tree, accustomed to brightness;
She sees a river washed with a muddy waterfall
From the pledge of Valfödr [Odin]—would you know yet more?
The “pledge of Valfödr” is his eye, sacrificed for supernatural vision. Appar
ently Heimdall put some portion of his hearing, or perhaps an ear, in the well at
the base of Yggdrasil in order to obtain his special powers of hearing. Although
he displays few other similarities with Odin, Heimdall does occasionally dis
pense wisdom, as when, in Thrymskvida, he suggests that Thor should dress up
as Freyja in order to get back his hammer. But this passage is troubling, for it says
that Heimdall, “whitest of gods, / could see well into the future, / like other
vanir.” There are no other indications of Heimdall’s membership in the vanir.
Nor has his whiteness ever been explained.
Heimdall seems to have a certain connection with peripheral locations: born
(if we take him to be the subject of the stanzas in Hyndluljód, as I do) at “the
edge of the earth,” encountering humans by a coast, stationed at the end of
heaven to guard against giants. These places are all to some extent boundaries:
between land and sea, between the world of the gods and that of the giants. Being
born “in days of yore” also situates Heimdall at a temporal periphery. Heimdall’s
other main action in the mythology involves not a spatial but a temporal bound
ary, namely, his sounding of the Gjallarhorn at the outset of Ragnarök. The main
source is Völuspá, stanza 46:.
Mím’s sons sport, and the world tree trembles
At the old Gjallarhorn.
170 Norse Mythology



Loudly blows Heimdall, the horn is aloft,
Odin is speaking to Mím’s head.
In Gylfaginning Snorri paraphrased this verse and added the information
that Heimdall blows the Gjallarhorn in order to awaken all the gods for a meet
ing to deal with the oncoming forces of chaos.
Of all the gods, Heimdall has the closest connection with an animal,
namely, the ram. According to Skáldskaparmál, a form of his name, Heimdali,
is a word for ram, and Heimdali and Hallinskídi turn up in the thulur for ram.
See also Ægir’s Daughters; Gjallarhorn; Hyndluljód; Rígsthula References and further reading: My opening definition of Heimdall, above, incorporates the title of an article by Jan de Vries, “Heimdallr, dieu énigmatique,” Études germaniques 10 (1955): 257–268, which tries to solve the enigma through etymology: Dall means something like “spontaneous energy” and was the god’s original name, Heim, “world,” having been added later. As far as I can see, this etymology has gained no adherents and gets us no closer to the solution than does the standard etymology, “World-gleam,” which contributed to all sorts of nature-mythological interpretations. Nor does Hugo Pipping’s reading of the name as “World-tree” in his Eddastudier, vol. 2, Studier i nordisk filologi, 17:3, and Skrifter utgivna av Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland, 189 (Helsinki: Mercator, 1926), 120–130. Two Lund dissertations scrutinized Heimdall. The first was that of Åke Ohlmarks, Heimdalls Horn und Odins Auge: Studien zur nordischen und vergleichenden Religionsgeschichte, vol. 1: Heimdall und das Horn (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1937), which uses suspect methodology to reach suspect conclusions. The second, just four years later, was that of Birger Pering, Heimdall: Religions
geschichtliche Untersuchungen zum Verständnis der altnordischen Götterwelt (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1941), who argued that “guardian of the gods” originally meant something more like a household spirit or brownie. Georges Dumézil, “Comparative Remarks on the Scandinavian God Heimdallr,” in his Gods of the Ancient Northmen, ed. Einar Haugen, Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology, 3 (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1973), 126–140, argues by means of a Celtic parallel for Ægir’s daughters as Heimdall’s mother. Kurt Schier, “Húsdrápa 2: Heimdall, Loki und die Meerniere,” in Festgabe für Otto Höfler zum 75. Geburtstag, ed. Helmut Birkhan, Philologica Germanica, 3 (Vienna: W. Braumuller, 1967), 577–588, makes sense out of the stanza in Úlf’s poem about the struggle between Heimdall and Loki. M. Meyer, “Beiträge zur germanischen Mythologie,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 23 (1907): 245–256 (esp. 250–256), addressed the idea of Heimdall as a boundary figure. Rudolf Much, “Der nordische Widdergott,” in Deutsche Islandforschung 1930, vol. 1: Kultur, ed. Walther Heinrich Vogt, Veröffentlichungen der Schleswig-Holsteinischen Universitätsgesellschaft, 1928:1 (Breslau: F. Hirt, 1930), 63–67, made the most powerful case yet for Heimdall as ram. The most recent article devoted wholly to Heimdall is now rather long in the tooth: Franz Rolf Schröder,

HEL
Ruler of the world of the dead; daughter of Loki and Angrboda, one of the three
monsters that resulted from that union.
Grímnismál, stanza 31, tells of the three roots of the world tree Yggdrasil. Hel
lives under one, frost giants live under another, and humans live under the third.
Hel’s abode is frequently described as having one or more halls, all surrounded
by a wall with an imposing gate called variously Helgrind (Hel-gate), Nágrind
(Corpse-gate), and Valgrind (Carrion-gate). The way there is call Helveg (Hel
road), and many texts speak of dying as going to or being held by Hel.
Snorri Sturluson’s Gylfaginning tells how Odin foresaw the trouble that
Loki’s three monstrous children—the Midgard serpent, Hel, and Fenrir the
wolf—would make. He had them brought to him and each was put somewhere
relatively safe (although the binding of the wolf Fenrir was not accomplished
without the loss of Ty ́r’s hand).
Hel he threw into Niflheim [Fog-world] and gave her power over nine worlds,
that she should host all those who were sent to her, and they are those who die
of illness or old age. She has a large residence there, and the walls are extremely
high and the gate huge. Éljudnir [Rain-damp] is the name of her hall, Hunger her
plate, Starving her knife, Ganglati her serving boy, Ganglöt her serving woman,
Stumbling Block the threshold that leads in, Kör [Sickbed] her bed, Blíkjanda
böl [Pale-misfortune] her bedhangings. She is half dark blue and half flesh color.
For this reason she is easily recognized and rather stooping but fierce.
Most of these details are not found outside of Snorri, but the notion of nine
netherworlds is not uncommon.
When older poetry says that people are “in” rather than “with” Hel, we are
clearly dealing with a place rather than a person, and this is assumed to be the
older conception. The place Hel (or the noun hel) originally probably just meant
“grave.” The personification probably came later.

172 Norse Mythology



HERMÓD
Son (or servant) of Odin, journeyed to Hel to try to have Baldr restored to the living.
The question of Hermód’s status (son or servant) is posed by the use of the
ambiguous expression sveinn Óƒins, “Odin’s lad,” in the main manuscript of
Snorri’s Edda (the other manuscripts say “son” explicitly). There is also a con
siderable body of evidence suggesting that Hermód may once have been a human
hero rather than a god. For example, he is linked with the hero Sigmund in
Hyndluljód, stanza 2; both are recipients of gifts from Odin. Hákonarmál, stanza
14, puts him at Valhöll awaiting the arrival of the recently defeated Hákon the
Good. He is mentioned together with Bragi, who may be the human poet Bragi
and not a god. Indeed, Snorri never mentions Hermód in his lists of æsir,
although he often seems to be present. Finally, there is the cognate hero Here
mod in Old English tradition, both of whose feet are firmly on earth.
If Hermód is Odin’s servant, he fulfills a role rather like that of Skírnir,
Frey’s servant, who was dispatched to the world of the giants to get Gerd as a
wife for Frey and to the world of the dwarfs to get the fetter Gleipnir to bind Fen
rir. If he is Odin’s son, he keeps the Baldr drama within a set of brothers: Baldr
the victim, Höd the killer, Hermód the rectifier.
In either case, Hermód’s journey to Hel is one of the more picturesque tales
in Scandinavian mythology, with many analogues in medieval Christian vision
literature and in the heroic legends of the world. He rides off on Odin’s horse
Sleipnir; passes over the river Gjöll on the Gjallarbrú after being challenged by
Módgud; leaps over Helgrind, the gate to Hel’s compound; and sits beside his
dead brother in Hel’s hall. The next day he gets Hel to agree to release Baldr if
all creation will weep (it will not), and from the world of the dead he takes back
to the gods Odin’s ring Draupnir, which was burned on Baldr’s pyre, and gifts
from Nanna to Frigg.
Hermód is an interesting figure, but the myth is not about him. It is about
Baldr and Höd, and they are the ones who return after Ragnarök.

HILDISVÍNI (BATTLE-PIG)
Freyja’s boar (or her lover or protégé).
Hildisvíni is known only from stanza 7 of Hyndluljód. Freyja is conversing with
the giantess Hyndla, and the giantess accuses Freyja of having her husband with
her on a trip to Valhöll. Freyja answers:
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 173



You are mistaken, Hyndla, I think you are dreaming,
When you say my husband is with me on a trip to Valhöll,
Where a gilded boar glistens, golden-bristled,
Hildisvíni, whom they made for me, skillful,
Two dwarfs, Dáin and Nabbi.
The “husband” in question is not Freyja’s husband at all but Óttar, a human
whom she has brought along to learn his genealogy. Some translators use “lover”
for the noun in question, which literally means “man.” The relationship of
Freyja and Óttar is mysterious, although the poem makes it clear that Freyja
favors him because he has worshipped her. If he appears in this stanza in the
shape of a boar, perhaps it is because Freyja has transformed him. Hildisvíni is
mentioned nowhere else.
See also Freyja; Gullinborsti; Hyndluljód
HIMINBJÖRG (HEAVEN-MOUNTAIN)
Heimdall’s home.
Grímnismál, stanza 13, which is part of the list of divine dwellings seen by Odin
as he hangs in Geirröd’s fire, is the main source:
Himinbjörg is the eighth, there yet they say Heimdall
Rules the cult places;
There the guardian of the gods drinks in the peaceful hall,
Happy, the good mead.
Snorri cites this verse when describing Heimdall in Gylfaginning. Paraphras
ing it, Snorri writes that Heimdall “lives at Himinbjörg near Bilröst. He is the
guardian of the gods and sits there at the end of heaven to guard the bridge from
mountain giants.” Although the bridge of the æsir leads to the well, which is pre
sumably at the center of the abode of the gods, Snorri’s notion of Bilröst as the
rainbow may have led him to put Himinbjörg at the end of heaven. Such a con
ception is, however, consistent with the notion of Heimdall as a boundary figure.

HJADNINGAVÍG (BATTLE-OF-THE-FOLLOWERS-OF-HEDIN)
Eternal combat of warriors, incited by Freyja and ended only through the holiness of
Olaf Tryggvason.
The fullest version of the story is in Sörla tháttr. Freyja has obtained a beautiful
necklace (the Brísinga men?) by sleeping with four neighboring dwarfs, but at
174 Norse Mythology



Odin’s command, Loki has stolen it. When Freyja awakens and misses the neck
lace, she confronts Odin, who tells her she can only have it back by fulfilling one
rather strange condition: She must make two kings, each of whom is served by
20 kings, fall out and engage in a battle that through charms and magic will go
on without end, unless it is interrupted by a Christian who serves a great king.
Although we never see Freyja or Odin again in the text, this condition is ful
filled when two great kings, Hedin and Högni, have a falling out when Hedin
abducts Högni’s daughter Hild. This he does through the machinations of Gön
dul, a woman who sits on a throne in a clearing in a dark forest and gives him a
magic potion to drink, which clouds his reason. Elsewhere Göndul is a valkyrie
name, and a medieval audience might well have recognized an association
between it and the word gandr, “magic.” The two armies meet on an island, and
each night and day for 143 years they fight. If someone’s head is cloven down to
the shoulders, immediately he is made whole, and the battle goes on. Only the
arrival and intervention of Ívarr ljómi (Gleam), a retainer of Olaf Tryggvason,
brings the battle to an end, an end that is welcomed by the weary warriors, who
know that they have been the victims of magic spells.
Although it is of interest in its own right, to my mind the Hjadningavíg is
most valuable in the context of Scandinavian mythology for casting a shadow
over the life of the einherjar at Valhöll. That life is presented as wholly positive,
but the endless battle of the Hjadningar is wholly negative. This has to do in part
with the view in Sörla tháttr of the pagan gods: Odin is an imperious ruler who
covets the possessions of his subjects, Loki is a toady and a thief, and Freyja sells
her body for a piece of jewelry. This is most easily explained as a post-pagan
view, but the situation is more complicated than that. In the first place, the story
was also told by Bragi Boddason the Old, reckoned the first skald, in his Rag
narsdrápa (stanzas 7–12), and in his version a woman keeps the battle going by
curing men’s wounds. This woman is decidedly evil. When Snorri describes the
Hjadningavíg in Skáldskaparmál, he says that Hild awakens the dead warriors
each night so that they can fight the next day, and this is a direct parallel to his
presentation of life at Valhöll. Snorri says that the Hjadningavíg will go on until
Ragnarök. I believe that the similarity between the Hjadningavíg and life at Val
höll points up the emptiness of a life given over to battles and feasting, an empti
ness, I would add, that is borne out when the einherjar prove to be of use at
Ragnarök when the entire world is destroyed.

HLIDSKJÁLF
Odin’s high seat, with a view over all the worlds.
Although a few skalds called Odin “Lord of Hlidskjálf,” Hlidskjálf does not oth
erwise appear in poetry. It is, however, crucial to two eddic poem, Grímnismál
and Skírnismál, each of which mentions Hlidskjálf in a prose header. In the
prose header to Grímnismál Odin and Frigg are sitting in Hlidskjálf and see their
foster sons Agnar and Geirröd, the one living in a cave, the other a king. Frigg
and Odin make a bet over whether Geirröd is stingy with food, and Odin sets off
to test the premise. In Skírnismál it is Frey who sits in Hlidskjálf and sees some
thing that sets in motion a narrative, namely, the beautiful arms of Gerd, which
make him lovesick. Frey sends Skírnir to woo the giantess on his behalf.
In Gylfaginning Snorri Sturluson says there is a place or estate called Hlid
skjálf, and when Alfödr sat in the high seat there, “he saw over all the worlds
and the behavior of each person and comprehended all the things he saw.”
Although this statement might make it seem that Hlidskjálf is Valhöll rather
than a seat, later in Gylfaginning Snorri refers explicitly to Hlidskjálf as the high
seat. Frey’s fateful use of the seat is mentioned in connection with the wooing
of Gerd, but the only time Odin actually uses it is to locate Loki after he has run
off from the scene of Baldr’s murder.
The name Hlidskjálf appears to mean something like “doorway-bench,” or
perhaps “watchtower.”
See also Baldr; Grímnismál; Loki
References and further reading: In an interesting argument, Vilhelm Kiil, “Hliƒskjálf og seiƒhjallr,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 75 (1960): 84–112, juxtaposed Hlidskjálf with the raised dais on which seid performances—attempts to see in other worlds—were apparently carried out.
HLÍN
Minor goddess; possible name for Frigg.
Snorri lists Hlín twelfth in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the
æsir and says, “She is put to watch over those people whom Frigg wishes to pro
tect from some danger. For that reason there is a proverb that the one who gets
176 Norse Mythology



away hleinir (‘protects’?).” The name is common as the base word in woman
kennings in skaldic poetry. Völuspá, stanza 53, says that the second sorrow of
Hlín will occur when Odin goes to fight the wolf at Ragnarök, and the bright
killer of Beli (i.e., Frey) goes against Surt; “then Frigg’s joy will perish.” If Hlín
is Frigg, her first sorrow would have been the death of Baldr.
HLÓRA
Thor’s foster mother, according to Snorri Sturluson in Skáldskaparmál.
No other source mentions the name, although it appears to be similar to the
Thor name Hlór(r)idi.
HLÓRRIDI
Alternate name for Thor, found in eddic poetry.
Hlórridi is the most common alternate name that Thor takes. It is found in
Hymiskvida, Lokasenna, and Thrymskvida, and in the verse of one older skald.
The name looks as though it should mean “noisy-rider,” but the meaning and
etymology are disputed.
HNOSS (TREASURE)
Daughter of Freyja and Ód, according to Snorri Sturluson’s Edda and according to
one of the thulur.
In Gylfaginning Snorri says that Hnoss is so beautiful that from her name things
that are beautiful and precious are known as hnossir (pl.). Hnoss is indeed a com
mon noun, but the relationship between it and Freyja’s daughter is the opposite
of what Snorri said: Hnoss appears in no myth, but Snorri repeats in Skáldska
parmál that “mother of Hnoss” is a valid kenning for Freyja.
See also Freyja
HÖD
Baldr’s killer, the blind son of Odin.
Höd’s role in Baldr’s death is found in stanza 32 in the Codex Regius version of
Völuspá in three words: “Höd did shoot.” In Baldrs draumar, stanza 11, Odin
asks the seeress who will kill Baldr. She replies,
Höd will bear the high praise-tree [Baldr] thither.
He will be the death of Baldr
And Odin’s son he will deprive of life.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 177



Neither of these stanzas says anything about Höd being blind, or of Loki
playing any role in Baldr’s death. That, however, is the way Snorri Sturluson has
it in Gylfaginning, in the best-known version of the story. In response to his bad
dreams, Baldr has been made invincible, and all the gods are honoring him by
flinging weapons at him. Loki learns that mistletoe did not take the oath not to
harm Baldr, and he makes a spear from it.
And Höd stood on the outside of the circle, because he was blind. Then Loki
said to him: “Why are you not shooting at Baldr?” He answers: “Because I
cannot see where Baldr is, and also because I have no weapon.” Then Loki said
to him: “Do as others do and honor Baldr as others do. I will show you where
he is standing; shoot this stick at him.” Höd took the mistletoe and shot it
at Baldr at Loki’s direction. The shot flew through Baldr, and he fell dead to
the earth.
In the Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus the cognate figure Høtherus is
a human king who, like the demigod Balderus, has fallen in love with Nanna.
Høtherus and an ally confront Balderus and the gods in a sea battle and gain vic
tory when Høtherus slices the handle off Thor’s hammer, the gods’ major
weapon, with his magic sword. Høtherus then marries Nanna. In a subsequent
battle, Balderus defeats him. Balderus is plagued by dreams of his desired Nanna.
Høtherus is now chosen king of the Danes, but in his absence the Danes vote
again, and this time they choose Balderus. In a following battle, Høtherus is put
to flight. In their final battle he deals Balderus a fatal wound. Here again, there
is no blindness and no accidental killing.
The name Höd seems quite clearly to mean “battle,” which would fit Saxo’s
version of the story better than Snorri’s. In any case, accidental or not, Baldr’s
death must be avenged, and Völuspá and Baldrs draumar also agree that
vengeance was visited on Höd. Just after saying that Höd did shoot, the seeress
who speaks Völuspá adds these lines:
Baldr’s brother was quickly born;
That son of Odin killed when he was one night old.
33. He did not wash his hands or comb his head,
Until he had carried to the pyre Baldr’s adversary.
Frigg still weeps in Fensalir the woe of Valhöll.
Similarly, in Baldrs draumar Odin asks the seeress who will avenge Baldr,
and she replies with another version of the lines just quoted. And Saxo has an
elaborate story of how Odin sires the avenger Bous on Rinda (Rind). In Gylfagin
ning Snorri tells how the gods take vengeance on Loki but are silent toward Höd.
178 Norse Mythology



However, in Skáldskaparmál he lists these kennings for Váli: “son of Odin and
Rind,” “avenging god of Baldr,” “enemy of Höd and his killer.” Clearly Snorri’s
reticence in Gylfaginning has to do with his presenting Höd as blind and victim
of Loki’s trickery.
Höd, however, like the avenger Váli, is one of the æsir who will survive Rag
narök and reinhabit the purged cosmos. Of the æsir, three pairs of brothers sur
vive Ragnarök: Thor’s sons Magni and Módi, Odin’s avenger sons Vídar and Váli,
and Baldr and Höd.

In Hoddmímir’s forest Líf and Lífthrasir will have morning dew as nourishment,
and from them the race of humans will descend.
Hodd means “treasure” or “gold,” and Mímir, of course, is an important if
enigmatic mythological figure. If Hoddmímir is identical with Mímir, his forest
would presumably be near the well with which Mímir is associated. A tree
called Mímameid is found twice in the poem editors call Fjölsvinnsmál.
Mímameid could be a name for Yggdrasil; if so, Hoddmímir’s forest might also
have to do with the tree.
HŒNIR
Enigmatic god, involved with such major moments of the mythology as the Æsir
Vanir War, the creation of human beings, and Ragnarök.
Stanzas 17–18 of Völuspá tell of the creation of the first humans, Ask and Embla,
who were found capable of little and fateless. Odin, Hœnir, and Lódur endow
them with the various qualities they need to live. Hœnir’s gift is óƒ, which ordi
narily means “poetry” and is in fact identical with the first syllable of Odin’s
name and with that of the shadowy god Ód. In his version of the creation of
humans in Gylfaginning, however, Snorri refers to wit and movement or possi
bly emotion at this point, and therefore some observers think óƒ has that mean
ing when Hœnir gives it to the proto-humans. However, Snorri says that the
creators were the sons of Bor, and there is no reason to think that that group
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 179



included Hœnir. What he gave to the first man and woman must remain a mys
tery, but if it is poetry, we must imagine a very close connection between Odin
and Hœnir.
There is also a close connection with Loki. Thjódólf of Hvin’s Haustlöng,
one of the oldest skaldic poems, refers to Loki twice as “Hœnir’s friend” and
once as “the tester of Hœnir’s courage.” The myth that Thjódólf is telling is that
of the encounter of Odin, Loki, and Hœnir with Thjazi, and the three also travel
together in the episode in heroic legend regarding the wergild (compensation) for
the killing of Otr. There, as in the Thjazi myth, Loki is the principal actor, but
the presence of Hœnir as one of a triad of traveling gods seems fairly constant.
According to Snorri’s story of the settlement following the Æsir-Vanir War
in Ynglinga saga, chapter 4, Hœnir was sent by the æsir to the vanir along with
Mímir as part of the exchange of hostages (men exchanged as a pledge of good
faith). Hœnir appeared to have the qualities of a chieftain, and the vanir imme
diately employed him in that capacity. But Hœnir relied exclusively on the
counsels of Mímir, and when Mímir was not present, Hœnir responded to
queries by saying, “Let others decide.” The vanir therefore deduced that they had
been cheated, and they beheaded Mímir and sent the head to Odin, who pre
served it and listened to the hidden things it had to say to him. Thus, Hœnir was,
indirectly at least, a contributor to Odin’s arsenal of techniques for acquiring and
mastering wisdom.
For the most part, the survivors of Ragnarök are pairs of second-generation
gods: Baldr and Höd, Magni and Módi, Vídar and Váli. But Völuspá, stanza 63,
adds Hœnir to the list. The line in question says that after unsown fields grow
and Baldr and Höd return, Hœnir was able to choose hlautviƒ, which looks as
though it should mean something like “wooden lots” (“lot” as in “to cast lots”).
If so, the line must mean that Hœnir survived Ragnarök and carried out some
sort of divining; some observers understand the line as referring to priestly func
tions of some sort. Snorri omits Hœnir from his account of Ragnarök and from
his catalog of the æsir in Gylfaginning, but he does say there that Njörd was
exchanged for Hœnir in the settlement of “the gods and the vanir.” Snorri does
put Hœnir at Ægir’s banquet at the beginning of Skáldskaparmál, however, so
he cannot have thought that Hœnir remained among the vanir. Later in Skáld
skaparmál Snorri mentions possible kennings for Hœnir, and these are strange
indeed: “swift god,” “long leg,” “mud king.” From these kennings has arisen
some speculation associating Hœnir with such birds as the crane or stork, but
such a surmise can hardly be aligned with his actual role in the mythology.
There his salient feature appears to be a close connection with Odin.

fäders tro,” Fornvännen 11 (1916): 104–118, saw Hœnir as a stork; Eric Elgqvist, “Guden Höner,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 72 (1957): 155–172, as a crane; and Folke Ström, “Guden Hœnir och odensvalan” Arv 12 (1956): 41–68 (summary in English), as a black stork. The connection with Odin is argued most ably by Franz Rolf Schröder, “Hœnir, eine mythologische Untersuchung,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur (1918): 219–252.
HÖRN
Name for Freyja.
Snorri says in Gylfaginning that Freyja has many names because she took on dif
ferent names among the various peoples she encountered when she went to
search for her missing husband, Ód. Hörn turns up frequently as a base word for
woman kennings in skaldic poetry, and one kenning does equate the name with
Freyja: “Praised child of Hörn” for a valuable ax, a precious object, that is, a
hnoss, which is the name of Freyja’s daughter. The meaning of the name is usu
ally taken to be related to the word for linen.
What makes the name Hörn most interesting is its appearance in place
names such as the Swedish Härnevi, which would represent a cult site for Hörn.

Gunnar Knudsen coined the phrase “pseudotheophoric place-names” to refer to ones wrongly associated with cult and included Härnevi as his main example: “Pseudotheofore stednavne,” Namn och bygd 27 (1939): 105–115.
HRÆSVELG
Giant, originator of the wind.
Hræsvelg is the subject of a question Odin puts to the wise giant Vafthrúdnir in
their contest of wisdom: “Whence comes the wind, / so that it travels over the
wave; / even men see it seldom” (Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 36). The giant answers
in the following stanza:
He is called Hræsvelg,
who sits at heaven’s end,
a giant, in the shape of an eagle;
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 181



from his wings
they say the wind comes
over all people.
Snorri knew this stanza. He paraphrased and then quoted it in Gylfaginning
when having Hár answer Gangleri’s question “Whence comes the wind?” Snorri
added the detail that the giant sat at the north end of heaven and that winds orig
inate from under the eagle giant’s wings when he spread them for flight.
Hræsvelg is usually understood as “Corpse-swallower,” which would be an
appropriate name both for an eagle and a giant, even if it has nothing to do with
wind. Jón Hnefill Aƒalsteinsson reads the name as “Shipwreck-current,” which
would agree more readily with the wind moving over the sea.
References and further reading: Jón Hnefill Aƒalsteinsson, “Gods and Giants in Old Norse Mythology,” Temenos 26 (1990), reprinted as “Hræsvelgr, the Wind-Giant, Reinterpreted,” in Jón Hnefill Aƒalsteinsson, A Piece of Horse Liver: Myth, Ritual, and Folklore in Old Icelandic Sources (Reykjavík: Háskólaútgáfan, 1998), 13–32.
HRAUDUNG
Human king, father of Agnar and Geirröd according to the prose header to
Grímnismál.
The name, if not the person, turns up in several other contexts associated with
heroic legend rather than with myth. Interestingly, it is also attested as a giant
name, probably because it means something like “destroyer.”
HRÍMFAXI
Horse that pulls Nótt (Night), according to Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 14, and Snorri
Sturluson, who paraphrases the stanza in Gylfaginning.
Stanza 14 answers a question put by Odin to Vafthrúdnir in stanza 13: “What
horse pulls Nótt [across the sky]?”
Hrímfaxi he is named, who pulls each
Night for the useful powers;
Bit-drops [of foam] he lets fall each morning,
Thence comes dew into the valleys.

HRÍMGRÍMNIR (FROST-MASKED)
Giant invoked in the threat Skírnir makes to Gerd in order to convince her to marry
Frey. The entire passage is thrilling, so I quote it in full:
33. Odin is enraged at you, the prince of the æsir [Thor] is enraged at you,
Frey will hate you,
You outrageously wicked girl, you have still got
The powerful rage of the gods.
34. Let the giants hear, let the frost-giants hear,
The sons of Suttung, members of the æsir,
How I forbid, how I ban,
Joy of men to the maid,
Use of men to the maid.
35. Hrímgrímnir is the name of the giant who shall possess you,
Down below Nágrind [the gate to Hel’s realm].
There let wretches on the roots of the tree
Give you goat piss.
A better drink you will never get,
Maiden, from your mouth,
Maiden, to your mouth.
36. Thurs [Giant] I carve for you and three staves
Ergi [sexual perversion] and madness and impatience;
So I can erase it, as I carved it,
If need be.
At this point, Gerd capitulates, and the marriage is arranged.
It is clear that Hrímgrímnir (whose name is included in the thulur for giants
but is not found elsewhere) is part of something bigger. If she will not marry
Frey, Gerd is to be denied all ordinary sexual congress, and that is clear (stanza
34). But the consequences of such denial are social. Despite being married (or
perhaps I should say mated), she will live in social exile, her wine turned not to
water but to worse (stanza 35). And all of this has a mental component as well
(stanza 36). No wonder she changed her mind.

HRINGHORNI (RING-HORN)
Baldr’s funeral ship, according to Snorri Sturluson in Gylfaginning.
The gods were unable to launch the ship and called for the help of the giantess
Hyrrokkin. She flung the ship down the rollers so fiercely that flames emerged
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 183



and the earth shook. Presumably with
the launching of the ship Snorri
intended a floating cremation, as is
described in some heroic literature.
The name of the ship could refer
to a ring or circle at the prow, as was
found on the Oseberg ship, a funeral
ship buried near the Oslo fjord during
the ninth century.

HRÓDVITNIR
Wolf, father of Hati, probably Fenrir.
Paraphrasing Grímnismál, Snorri
Sturluson writes in the Gylfaginning
of his Edda that Hati Hródvitnisson
(son of Hródvitnir) will swallow the
moon. The identification with Fenrir
comes from Lokasenna, stanza 39.
Loki has just reminded Ty ́r that Fenrir
ripped his hand off. Ty ́r responds:
I lack my hand, and you lack Hródvitnir;
A baleful loss for each.
Nor does the wolf have it well, who in bonds shall
Await the judgment of the gods.
The name Hródvitnir (or Hródrsvitnir, another form of the name) means
something like “famous wolf.”

HROPT
Alternate name for Odin, perhaps the one most commonly found in skaldic and
eddic poetry.
The meaning of this name is disputed, but some observers think there is a con
nection with Odin’s erotic activity, especially his seduction of Rind so as to beget
an avenger for Baldr. The best evidence for this surmise is the fact that in Book 3
of Saxo’s Gesta Danorum, which describes this seduction, Odin takes the name
Rofterus (in Book 9 he takes the similar name Roftarus when he cures Siwardus
[Sigurd] in such as way as to give him the nickname “snake-in-the-eye”).
See also Odin; Rind References and further reading: Magnus Olsen, “En iagttagelse vedkommende Balder-diktningen,” in Studier tillägnade Axel Kock, tidskriftens redaktör, 1888–1925, Arkiv för nordisk filologi, 40, supplement (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup), 169–177, argued the connection with the seduction of Rind.
HRUNGNIR
Strongest of the giants, defeated by Thor in a formal duel.
The myth is retained in the skald Thjódólf of Hvin’s Haustlöng, stanzas 14–20,
and in the Skáldskaparmál of Snorri’s Edda. As Snorri tells it, there are four
scenes: Odin’s initial encounter with Hrungnir, Thor’s journey to the duel, the
duel itself, and the aftermath. Thjódólf tells only the middle two, although he
hints at the last. Stanzas 14–16 of Haustlöng describe Thor’s journey to the duel,
as the entire cosmos reacts—mountains shake and the earth is in flames. Stan
zas 17–19 tell of the giant’s standing on his shield and of weapons flying at each
other, Thor’s hammer and the giant’s whetstone. In stanza 20 Thjódólf hints at
the removal of the piece of whetstone from Thor’s head, but we learn no more.
According to Snorri, the onset of the story takes place when Odin is riding
Sleipnir and encounters the giant Hrungnir mounted on Gullfaxi (Gold-mane).
They exchange words, and soon Hrungir is pursuing Odin in a giant rage. He
rides all the way into Ásgard, where the gods are required to give hospitality.
Drunk, the giant boasts he will move Valhöll to Giantland and kill all the giants
except Freyja and Sif, whom he will keep for himself. The gods call on Thor, but
because Hrungnir is a guest no blows may be exchanged. The two therefore agree
to a duel, to be held at Grjótúnargard (Stony-farm-enclosure). The giants, espe
cially, realize that the duel is important, for Hrungnir is the strongest of them.
The travel scene is highly attenuated in Skáldskaparmál. Thor arrives at the
dueling place with Thjálfi, who is not in Thjódólf’s version. Nor is the clay mon
ster Mökkurkálfi (Mist-calf), whom the giants have built to be Hrungnir’s sec
ond and who is equipped with the heart of a mare. Mökkurkálfi is not much use,
however; he wets himself at the sight of Thor and is easily killed by Thjálfi.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 185



Thjálfi’s big contribution is to tell Hrungnir that Thor will attack from below.
The giant stands on his shield and thus cannot use it to protect himself against
the hammer Mjöllnir. Thor flings his hammer, and the giant flings his whetstone
in return. The weapons meet in midair. The hammer shatters the whetstone and
finds its mark, killing Hrungnir, but a piece of the whetstone lodges in Thor’s
head. He lies under Hrungnir’s body until his three-year-old son Magni (three
nights old, according to some manuscripts of Snorri’s Edda!) lifts it off, saying
that he could have killed the giant easily.
Thor is visited by the seeress Gróa, who is to sing the whetstone out of his
head. When Thor thinks the cure is imminent, he wishes to reward her, and he
tells her that he carried her husband Aurvandil back from Giantland in a basket.
A toe was sticking out and it froze, so Thor broke it off and threw it up into the
sky to make the star Aurvandilstá (Aurvandil’s toe). He tells her Aurvandil will
soon be home. At this news Gróa loses her concentration, and the piece of whet
stone never does get out of Thor’s head.
The most important aspect of this myth is of course that Thor is able to
defeat the strongest of giants in a formal duel. Duels had a certain legal status,
and the gods therefore once again ratified their hierarchical superiority over the
giants. However, in my view it is also important that Thor is able in the end to
clean up a mess first made by Odin, and in so doing we even learn that he put a
star in place, thereby taking on a bit of the cosmogonic role usually held by
Odin. The myth shows not only how close the rivalry between the gods and
giants is, but also how close the rivalry between Odin and Thor is.

References and further reading: Kemp Malone, “Hrungnir,” Arkiv för nordisk
filologi 61 (1946): 284–285, proposes an etymology for Hrungnir meaning “big person, strong man.” In his Gods of the Ancient Northmen, ed. Einar Haugen, Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology, 3 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973), 68–71, Georges Dumézil makes the argument that the story involves the initiation of Thjálfi by Thor, in the killing of the made monster, and several eminent scholars have accepted this hypothesis. My analysis of the story is to be found in “Thor’s Duel with Hrungnir,” Alvíssmál: Forschungen zur mittelalterlichen Kultur Scandinaviens 6 (1996): 3–18.
HUGIN (THOUGHT) AND MUNIN (MIND)
Odin’s two ravens.
In eddic poetry, Hugin and Munin are mentioned in Grímnismál, stanza 20:
Hugin and Munin fly each day
Over the earth.
186 Norse Mythology



I am worried about Hugin, that he not come back,
And yet more worried about Munin.
Why they fly is indicated by Snorri Sturluson, who says in Gylfaginning,
just before quoting the above stanza,
Two ravens sit on his [Odin’s] shoulders and say into his ear everything they see
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 187

and confronted by a serpent. (Statens Historiska Museum, Stockholm)



or hear. Their names are Hugin and Munin. He dispatches them at daybreak to
fly over all the world and they return at breakfast time. From this he becomes
wise about many events, and thus he is called the Raven-god.
In chapter 8 of his Ynglinga saga Snorri gives a euhemerized version: Odin
has two ravens to whom he had taught speech. They fly all around and report
back to him.
The ravens’ connection with Odin may be age-old, for Migration Period
bracteates frequently portray a figure with birds near his head, and many
observers believe this motif is Odin and his ravens. Hugin and Munin are
attested as raven names in early skaldic poetry. The ability to send one’s
“thought” and “mind” may be related to the trance-state journey of shamans.
The worry about their return, expressed in the stanza from Grímnismál, would
be consistent with the danger the shaman faces on the trance-state journey.
See also Bracteates; Odin References and further reading: Hugin and Munin are treated among Albert Morey Sturtevant’s “Comments on Mythological Name Giving in Old Norse,” Germanic Review 29 (1954): 68–71.
HVEDRUNG
Alternate name for Loki.
Völuspá, stanza 55, describing the vengeance that Vídar takes on Fenrir, calls the
beast “the son of Hvedrung,” and the skaldic poem Ynglinga tal, by Thjódólf of
Hvin, uses the kenning “Hvedrung’s maiden” for Hel. As Fenrir and Hel make
up two of Loki’s three monstrous offspring, Hvedrung must be Loki.
The thulur list Hvedrung as an Odin name, but it is found nowhere.
See also Fenrir; Hel; Loki
HVERGELMIR (HOT-SPRING-BOILER)
Spring located near the center of the cosmos.
The major source is Grímnismál, stanza 26:
Eikthyrnir is the name of a hart, who stands at the hall of Herjafödr [Odin]
And bites from the limbs of Lærad.
Yet from his horns it drips into Hvergelmir,
Thence all waters have their ways.
In Gylfaginning Snorri Sturluson assigns Hvergelmir to the mythic past:
It was many ages before the earth was created, that Niflheim was made, and in
the middle of it is the spring Hvergelmir, and from it flow those rivers that are
188 Norse Mythology



so named: Svöl (Cool), Gunnthrá (Battle-pain), Fjörm (Rushing), Fimbulthul
(Mighty-wind or Mighty-speaker), Slíd (Dangerous) and Hríd (Storm), Sylg
(Slurp) and Ylg (She-wolf), Víd (Wide), Leipt (Flash).
Although he does not state it explicitly, these rivers appear to be the Élivá
gar, which Snorri begins describing in the next paragraph. But they are not all the
rivers that flow from Hvergelmir according to Snorri. Later in Gylfaginning
Snorri says that drops from the horn Eikthyrnir flow down into Hvergelmir, and
from it flow these rivers:
Síd, Víd, Sœkin, Eikin, Svöl, Gunnthrá, Fjörm, Fimbulthul, Gípul, Göpul,
Gömul, Geivimul—these flow into the settlements of the æsir. These are
named too: Thyn, Vín, Thöll, Höll, Grá, Gunnthráin, Nyt, Nöt, Nönn, Hrönn,
Vína, Vegsvínn, Thjódnuma.
Elsewhere in Gylfaginning Snorri says that there are countless serpents in
Hvergelmir with the dragon Nídhögg.

HYMIR
Hardheaded giant; host and fishing buddy of Thor when Thor hooks the Midgard ser
pent; owner of the kettle Thor gets to brew the beer of the gods; father of Ty ́r.
Thor’s interactions with Hymir are found in the (probably late) eddic poem
Hymiskvida and in Snorri’s Gylfaginning. According to Hymiskvida, Hymir has
the kettle that the gods need to brew beer, but he gives it to Thor after Thor is
able to pass the test of breaking a cup. This he does, following the advice of Ty ́r’s
mother, by throwing it at the head of the giant, which is harder than any cup.
The giant says the gods can have the kettle if they can lift it, but only Thor can
pass this second test. On the way home Hymir leads a force of giants against
Thor, and Thor kills them all.
Snorri makes of Hymir a less-imposing figure. He hosts Thor when the lat
ter appears in the form of a young man, but he clearly has doubts about the lad’s
abilities. Thor is able to dispel these doubts, and when the two go fishing it is
Thor who pushes the envelope. They venture into uncharted waters, and when
Thor hooks the Midgard serpent, the giant—apparently out of fear, not any soli
darity with his jötun kin—cuts the line, so that the serpent probably survived
the encounter, according to Snorri. Hymir apparently does not, as Thor smacks
him overboard.
According to Hymiskvida, Hymir is the father of Ty ́r, one of the æsir, and
this makes Hymir unique (Loki has a giant father, Fárbauti, but Loki is only
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 189



numbered among the æsir, not a
real member of the group). If
Hymir really succeeded in mak
ing a marriage with one of the
female æsir, as the poem sug
gests, he is the only such success
story of the jötnar. Besides Ty ́r,
his son, he apparently had
daughters who remained giants:
In Lokasenna, stanza 34, when
Njörd challenges Loki, Loki
responds with this unflattering
stanza:
Shut up, Njörd. You were sent
from here to the east
A hostage for the gods;
Hymir’s maidens used you as
a urinal
And pissed in your mouth.
It is not impossible that
“Hymir’s maidens” is simply a
kenning for giantesses, since
Hymir is often the modifier in
kennings for giants. However,
there is a parallel with Geirröd,
whom Thor also visits and whose
two threatening daughters he
kills. Perhaps here we see a com
parison between helpless old
Njörd and Thor, the god of might.
The etymology of Hymir’s
name has not been satisfactorily
explained.

HYMISKVIDA
Eddic poem, detailing Thor’s visit to a giant, his fishing up of the Midgard serpent,
and his acquisition of a huge kettle in which to brew beer.
The poem is found in both of the main manuscripts of eddic poetry, the title only
in the lesser of the two, AM 748 4to. In Codex Regius it is situated between Hár
bardsljód and Lokasenna and was probably regarded by the compiler as a Thor
poem in the manuscript.
As the poem begins, a feast is in the offing (stanzas 1–2), and a giant, pre
sumably Ægir, thinking of vengeance, bids Thor get a kettle in which to brew
beer (stanza 3). The gods are at a loss, until Ty ́r tells Thor (stanza 4) that to the
east dwells a giant, the very wise Hymir, Ty ́r’s father, who has a huge kettle, a
league deep (stanza 5), which might be obtained through cunning (stanza 6). Ty ́r
and Thor set out and travel until they come to Egil, who is herding Hymir’s goats
(stanza 7). Stanza 8 is puzzling:
The son met the mother, much loathsome to him,
She had nine hundred heads.
Another still went forth, all in gold,
White about the brows, to bear beer to her son.
This second woman bids the two gods hide under a kettle (stanza 9). Hymir
returns home (stanza 10), and Ty ́r’s mother tells Hymir that his son and Thor are
there. Pillars burst and fall when he gazes upon them, so fierce is his anger
(stanza 12–13), but he must fulfill his duties as a host. At dinner, Thor alone eats
two of Hymir’s oxen (stanza 15). They agree to go fishing the next morning
(stanza 16). Thor says he will row if the giant will fetch the bait, but the giant
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 191



sends Thor on that expedition (stanzas 17–18). Thor tears the head off one of
Hymir’s oxen (stanza 19). The scene shifts abruptly to the fishing expedition.
Thor asks Hymir to row further out, but the giant demurs (stanza 20). Hymir
fishes up two whales, but then Thor casts his line (stanza 21). With the ox head
as bait, he fishes up the Midgard serpent (stanza 22), draws it aboard, and
smashes it with his hammer (stanza 23). As the whole cosmos reacts, the serpent
sinks into the sea (stanza 24). Hymir is downcast as they row back to shore
(stanza 25), and he asks Thor to help him moor the boat (stanza 26).Thor hauls
it all the way up to the giant’s house (stanza 27). Hymir bids Thor break a cup
(stanza 28), but he cannot (stanza 29). The woman counsels him to throw it at
the head of the giant (stanza 30). Thor does so and breaks the cup (stanza 31). The
giant now offers Thor and Ty ́r the kettle, if they can lift it (stanza 32). Ty ́r is
unable to do so (stanza 33), but Thor picks it up and they leave (stanza 34). A
pack of giants led by Hymir pursues them (stanza 35), and Thor kills them all
with his hammer (stanza 36). They are further delayed because one of Thor’s
goats is lame, which Loki caused (stanza 37). The giants were paid with blows
(stanza 38), and Thor got the kettle for brewing beer (stanza 39).
In Gylfaginning Snorri relates the story of the fishing expedition, and
although Hymiskvida must have been his principal source, there is a huge dif
ference: Snorri says that in his fear the giant cut the line, allowing the serpent
to sink into the water and making it unclear whether the hammer thrown after
it struck the target with any effect. The poem, on the other hand, seems to sug
gest that Thor killed the serpent or at least dealt it a mighty blow. Preben Meu
lengracht Sørensen has explained the differences between the versions as
involving not only a time difference but also differing conceptions of the rela
tionship between the gods and their adversaries as Christianity approached and
was adopted. Snorri also has a few other interesting details, of which perhaps
the most interesting is that Thor strikes the giant with his fist and throws him
overboard.
Scholars are agreed that the poem itself is fairly late, dating from the
eleventh or even, according to the most radical (and in my view quite unlikely)
view, from around the time Snorri was writing. But the central myth, the fish
ing up of the Midgard serpent, was widely known and popular during the Viking
Age, as both skaldic poetry and rock carvings attest. The earliest skald, Bragi
Boddason the Old, has a section of Thor’s encounter with the Midgard serpent in
his Ragnarsdrápa, and Úlf Uggason, working in Iceland circa 985, also has it.
Bragi is describing a shield, and Úlf is describing the carvings in a hall, so we
know that the story was popular in image form. But there are also Viking Age
rock carvings that without doubt portray the scene: at Altuna, Sweden, and Hør
dum Ty, Denmark, and on the fragment from the church at Gosforth, England.
192 Norse Mythology



The myth of the acquisition of the kettle, on the other hand, is not wide
spread. There appears to be an allusion to it in the First Grammatical Treatise,
an Icelandic work of the twelfth century, but otherwise it is unknown outside
the Poetic Edda, even if Ægir’s banqueting seems to presuppose it. Nevertheless,
the gods’ acquisition of precious objects from the world of the giants is a con
stant of the mythology. And there is a good deal of logic in the notion that Odin
obtained the mead of poetry—that is, the mental part of inspiration—and Thor
obtained the physical object in which beer, the reflex of the mead in the human
world, is made. Furthermore, Franz Rolf Schröder has argued for comparisons in
Indic myth that would make possible the reconstruction of an Indo-European
original. This section of the poem is also interesting in that it assigns to the god
Ty ́r a giant father and a mother who sides with the æsir against her husband. Ty ́r
would be the only one of the æsir (other than Loki), whose status as a member
of the æsir the mythology spectacularly unravels, to have such a father.
Loki’s laming of Thor’s goat in stanza 37 is not known from other sources.
In Snorri’s account of the journey of Thor to Útgarda-Loki, the human boy
Thjálfi inadvertently lames one of Thor’s goats, and it is as compensation for
this injury that Thjálfi and his sister Röskva become Thor’s human servants. A
connection between Loki’s and Thjálfi’s laming of the goats may be vitiated by
the possibly malign motive of Loki in Hymiskvida, but Loki and Thjálfi (and
Ty ́r!) share the role of Thor’s companion on journeys to the world of the giants.
Thus, Hymiskvida tantalizes in many details, even if the central myth, the fish
ing up of the Midgard serpent, was central to the mythology.

HYNDLULJÓD
Eddic poem, consisting of a visit by Freyja to the giantess Hyndla to retrieve
genealogical information and including within it the “Short Völuspá.”
The poem is found only in Flateyjarbók, an Icelandic manuscript from the end
of the fourteenth century with a focus on materials concerning the kings of Nor
way. A prose header to the poem states that it was recited about Óttar heimski
(The Foolish), and indeed the poem itself traces this Óttar’s genealogy, although
his identity remains unknown. The genealogical material is inserted into a
frame story of Freyja’s visit to Hyndla, whom she calls her friend and sister but
who lives in a cave and apparently rides a wolf. At the end of the poem, Hyndla
tells Freyja that she wishes to sleep, which is reminiscent of the seeresses called
up by Odin to perform in Völuspá and Baldrs draumar. In the last stanza Freyja
explicitly calls Hyndla a giant’s bride.
The early stanzas give information about the principal æsir. In stanzas 2 and
3 Freyja says that Herjafödr (Odin) gives gold to men. He gave Hermód a helmet
and byrnie and Sigmund a sword. “To his sons he gives victory and to his sons
riches” (“to his sons” is often changed by editors to “to some”). “He gives speech
and brains to men, sailing wind to men and poetry to poets, courage to many a
warrior.” In stanza 4 Freyja turns to Thor, to whom she will sacrifice, she says,
to make him ever well disposed to her companion, “although he does not care
for the brides of giants.” The two then apparently travel. Hyndla accuses Freyja
of having her husband or lover (apparently Óttar) along on the way to Hel, but
Freyja denies the accusation. Stanza 9 refers to a wager between Óttar and the
hero Anganty ́r, which some have taken to be the motivation for the poem.
Stanza 10 shows why Freyja is partial to Óttar.
He made an altar for me, loaded up with stones,
Now that gravel has turned into [burned to?] glass;
He reddened with the blood of nine cattle;
Óttar ever believed in the goddesses.
In stanza 11 the speaker, evidently still Freyja, requests a tallying up of
genealogical information, and this information fills stanzas 12–28. Then the
speaker, now presumably Hyndla, addresses Óttar directly, and her stanzas fre
quently end with the refrain “That is all your family, foolish Óttar.” This fam
ily of foolish Óttar involved dynastic lines, such as the Skjöldungar, Skilfingar,
Ödlingar, and Ynglingar; some famous heroes, such as Sigurd, Gunnar, and
Högni; and a few names that arouse interest from the point of view of the
mythology. There is a Fródi, apparently Óttar’s maternal grandfather, and a
Nanna, the daughter of Nökkvi; neither of these, however, seems to be imagined
as anything other than a human ancestor of Óttar.
194 Norse Mythology



Toward the end of the poem, in stanza 45, Freyja asks that “memory-beer”
be brought to or by means of her boar, so that he (the boar? Óttar? Are they one
and the same?) may remember everything when he and Anganty ́r recount their
genealogies. Here the relationship between the two female figures turns increas
ingly antagonistic, and as the poem draws to a close, Hyndla has apparently
brought the beer, mixed with poison. Freyja has the last word:
Your spoken wish will have no effect,
Even if, giant’s bride, you promise evil;
He will drink the precious beverage,
I ask all the gods to help Óttar.
Thus described, the poem puts Freyja in the role ordinarily played by Odin,
the member of the æsir who calls upon a member of the giant race to gain infor
mation in spoken form, as in Völuspá and Baldrs draumar, and triumphs ver
bally over the giant at the end of the encounter, as in Baldrs draumar and
Vafthrúdnismál. Although an overt connection with a protected human is not
part of that Odinic form, Odin certainly does have a close connection with
human heroes, probably the closest of any deity.
The formal connection with Völuspá accords with the common scholarly
understanding that some portion of Hyndluljód is the “Short Völuspá.” We have
the title from Snorri, who quotes stanza 33 in Gylfaginning. This stanza says
that all seeresses descend from Vidólf, all witches from Vilmeid, all bearers of
seid from Svarthöfdi, and all giants from Ymir. Since the last use of the refrain
“That is all your family, foolish Óttar,” occurs in stanza 29, where the speaker
turns to the æsir, specifically Baldr, it would seem that the “Short Völuspá”
begins there, and it would seem to run through stanza 44, which echoes the end
ing stanzas of Völuspá:
Then will come another, yet more powerful,
Although I dare not name that one;
Few now see farther into the future,
And yet Odin will meet the wolf.
Like Völuspá, the “Short Völuspá” is punctuated by a refrain, not “Would
you know more?” but rather “Do you wish to go yet further?” or “Do you wish
yet more?” But despite the reference to Ragnarök in the last stanza, the “Short
Völuspá” offers not a sweep of mythic history but rather a disjointed set of
mythic allusions and mythological information. Stanza 29 indeed gives a brief
précis of the Baldr story (he died and was avenged by Váli); most of the rest of the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 195



poem tells who was descended from or married to whom; stanza 35 (and possi
bly stanzas 36–38) tell of the birth of one with nine mothers, presumably Heim
dall; and stanzas 40–41 are about Loki. Stanza 41 has information found nowhere
else: Loki got pregnant by a woman (seemingly by eating a woman’s heart, but
the lines are obscure) and every female monster on earth was the result.
Another way to view the poem is to focus on Óttar’s visit to the otherworld,
and such a view will lead one to medieval and Christian analogs. Certainly most
scholars have dated the poem to the post-Conversion period, most often the
twelfth century.

References and further reading: Jere Fleck, “Konr–Óttar–Geirrøƒr: A Knowledge Criterion for Succession to the Germanic Sacred Kingship,” Scandinavian Studies 42 (1970): 39–49, thought Hyndluljód was part of a pattern in which a prince obtained sacral information with the help of a divine patron. Aron Gurevich argued something similar in his “Edda and Law: Commentary upon Hyndluljód,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 88 (1973): 72–84, but he thought that the poem had more to do with means of inheriting property in Norway than with some distant Germanic sacral kingship. Like Gurevich, Gro Steinsland, Det hellige bryllup og norrøn kongeideologi: En analyse av hierogami-myten i Skírnismál, Ynglingatal, Háleygjatal, og Hyndluljód (N.p.: Solum, 1991), operates with the idea of the received poem as a single entity rather than an interpolated mess. She sets the poem in “a milieu in which knowledge of the origin of the royal family in a holy marriage between a god and a giant woman will have been among the important elements of royal ideology” (p. 259).
HYRROKKIN (FIRE-SMOKED)
Giantess, according to Snorri Sturluson the one who launched Baldr’s funeral ship.
Hyrrokkin is not mentioned by name in extant poetry, with one notable excep
tion: Thorbjörn dísarskáld includes her in the catalog of giants he credits Thor
with killing in one of the two little late-tenth-century fragments addressed
directly to Thor. However, the Húsdrápa of Úlf Uggason, which was composed
in Iceland around 985, refers to a figure who must be Hyrrokkin, to judge from
Snorri’s account of Baldr’s funeral in Gylfaginning. Here is the relevant part of
what Snorri said about Baldr’s funeral:
And the æsir took Baldr’s body and transported it to the sea. Hringhorni was the
name of Baldr’s ship. It was the greatest of ships. The gods wanted to launch it
and make on it Baldr’s funeral pyre, but the ship would not budge. Then
Hyrrokkin, an ogress, was sent for from Jötunheimar. She arrived riding a wolf
with poisonous snakes for reins, and when she dismounted, Odin called to four
berserks to look after the horse, and they could not hold it unless they killed it.
196 Norse Mythology



Then Hyrrokkin went to the prow of the ship and shot it forward at the first try
so that sparks leapt out of the runners and all the lands shook.
Úlf’s stanza, number 12 in the conventional numbering, is as follows:
The very powerful Hild of the mountains [giantess] caused the sea-Sleipnir to
trudge forward; but the wielders of the helmet flames [warriors] of Hropt [Odin]
felled her mount.
Úlf’s stanza was certainly known to Snorri (Húsdrápa is only retained in
Snorri’s Skáldskaparmál), and it does not appear that he needed to have known
any other stanzas in order to have written what he did in Gylfaginning. How
ever, it is important to recall that Úlf’s Húsdrápa was composed to put into
words the carvings in a hall in western Iceland, and even if the hall did not sur
vive the two centuries that separated it from Snorri, descriptions of it could eas
ily have done so, including fuller narratives about the carvings in it.
Hyrrokkin was clearly a relatively important figure in the last decades of
paganism in Iceland. Her name remains unexplained. Perhaps she was shriveled
and dark, giving her a monstrous appearance like some of Thor’s other victims,
such as Hengankjöpa (Slack-jaw).

References and further reading: Otto Höfler, “Balders Bestattung und die nordischen Felszeichnungen,” Anzeiger der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissen
schaften, phil.-hist. Kl., 88 (1951): 343–372, argued pictorial continuity between Bronze Age rock carvings and the carvings in the Icelandic hall described in Úlf’s Húsdrápa and then went on to explain Hyrrokkin and the other details in Baldr’s funeral as misinterpretations of an old pictorial cult scene; needless to say, this is a bit speculative. In the third chapter of my Murder and Vengeance among the Gods: Baldr in Scandinavian Mythology, FF Communications, 262
(Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1997), I presented the story about Hyrrokkin as an encounter between Odin and a giantess in which Odin triumphs and his will, in this case a proper funeral for Baldr, is carried out.
IDAVÖLL
Assembly field of the æsir in Völuspá and Snorri’s Gylfaginning; associated with tem
poral beginnings.
Idavöll is mentioned twice in Völuspá. The first instance is in stanza 7, just after
they have established time reckoning by naming day and night and the other
parts of the temporal cycle in stanza 6.
The æsir assembled at Idavöll
Those who altar and temple high timbered.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 197



They created wealth, smithed riches,
Forged tongs and made tools.
When Idavöll appears again in the poem (in stanza 60), it is a reappearance,
after the demise and resurrection of the cosmos, just after the seeress has seen
the earth come up for a second time.
The æsir will assemble at Idavöll
And adjudge the powerful Midgard serpent,
And there remember might
And Fimbulty ́r’s [Odin’s] ancient runes.
Snorri paraphrases these verses. For the first one, he puts Idavöll in the mid
dle of the stronghold of the gods but says nothing about assembly. He appears
to put Gladsheim and Vingólf on Idavöll. He paraphrases the second stanza as
follows:
Vídar and Váli will live, because the sea and Surt’s fire will not have harmed
them, and they will dwell at Idavöll, where Ásgard used to be.
As is so often the case, much of the discussion has centered on the etymol
ogy of the word, or in this case, the first syllable. Idavöll means either “eternal
field” or perhaps “shimmering field” or even “field of pursuits [of the gods].”
The first makes the most sense, given that Idavöll is the terrestrial equivalent of
the paired second-generation gods and their gaming pieces and memories that
survive the mythological present and Ragnarök.

IDUN
Guardian of the apples of the gods; given over to and retrieved from the giant Thjazi.
The story is found in the skaldic poem Haustlöng, by Thjódólf of Hvin, and in
the Skáldskaparmál section of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda. The story begins with
Odin, Hœnir, and Loki traveling and unable to cook an ox. An eagle in the tree
above claims responsibility and says the ox will cook if he may have some. How
ever, when he tries to take a vast amount, Loki strikes at him with a staff. The
staff sticks to the eagle and to Loki’s hand, and the eagle flies off with Loki in
tow. As he bangs against things, Loki agrees to the eagle’s demand: that he bring
him Idun and her apples. This he does by luring Idun into the forest, where the
eagle, who is actually the giant Thjazi, arrives and carries her off. Without their
apples, the gods grow old and gray, and they force Loki to agree to get Idun back.
198 Norse Mythology



In Freyja’s falcon coat he flies to Jötunheimar, changes Idun into a nut, and flies
off with her. Thjazi pursues in the form of an eagle. The gods kindle a fire just
as Loki flies into Ásgard, and Thjazi’s feathers are singed and he falls to the earth
and is killed by the gods.
This is one of the most dangerous moments for the gods in the mythologi
cal present, for giants are not supposed to be able to mate with goddesses. The
fact that the gods grow old and gray—that is, display mortality—indicates what
would happen if the flow of females, ordinarily from the giants to the gods, were
to be reversed. What follows immediately in Snorri is Skadi’s quest for
vengeance, which ends with her becoming married to Njörd.
Although Haustlöng calls Idun the “maiden who understood the eternal life
of the æsir” but does not mention the apples, in Snorri’s version of the story
Idun’s apples clearly function as a symbol of the immortality of the gods. Indeed,
when he presents Idun in Gylfaginning, Snorri says she is the wife of Bragi:
She keeps in her bag the apples that the gods are to chew when they grow old,
and then all become young again, and so shall it be until Ragnarök.
In Skírnismál stanzas 19–20, Skírnir offers and Gerd rejects 11 apples of
gold. These are the only other prominent apples in the mythology, and some
observers associate them with Idun’s apples. The bucket that contained apples
on the ninth-century Norwegian Oseberg funeral ship also deserves mention.
However, the presumed etymological meaning of Idun—“ever young”—would
permit her to carry out her mythic function without apples.
In Lokasenna, stanza 16, Idun asks Bragi not to quarrel with Loki, but in the
following stanza Loki accuses Idun of having slept with the killer of her brother.
The identity of her brother and the killer remain unknown.

IFING
River separating the worlds of gods and giants.
Ifing is known only in Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 16:
Ifing is the name of the river that divides for the sons of giants
And for the sons of gods the earth;
It will run open throughout all ages
There will never be ice on the river.
A river on which ice will never form is one that runs swiftly and therefore
is extremely difficult to ford.
ING
Figure found in the Old English Rune Poem, implied in the Germania of Tacitus, and
associated with the Frey names Yngvi and Ingunar-Frey.
Ing is the name of the rune that stands for the sound -ng-. In the Old English
Rune Poem (eighth or ninth century?), the verse in question runs as follows:
Ing was first among the East Danes
Seen by people, until he afterwards eastward
Went over the wave; a cart ran after him.
Thus the Heardingas named this hero.
The cart was associated with the vanir from the time of Nerthus and
endured even into the jocular account of the worship of Frey in Ögmundar tháttr
dytts. Scholars have associated the Heardingas, who must be a people or a
dynasty, with the Haddingjar, twin or multiple warriors in their turn associated
with the Danish King Hadingus in Book 1 of Saxo’s Gesta Danorum; Hadingus
is said to have established an annual sacrifice to Frey which the Swedes call
Frøblot.
In chapter 2 of his Germania, composed around the end of the first century
C.E., Tacitus writes this about the Germanic peoples:
They celebrate in ancient songs . . . a god Tuisto, born from the earth, and his
son Mannus as the origin and founders of their people. To Mannus they assign
three sons, from whose names are called the Ingaevones near the ocean, those
in the center as Herminones, and the rest Istaevones.
Ing must be the son of Mannus after whom the Ingaevones (more often
known as the Ingvaeones) are named. The connection with the sea is interesting,
200 Norse Mythology



and one might speculate that the Old English Rune Poem testifies to a move
ment of the cult of Ing away from the coast toward the territory that had once
been that of the central Herminones. If the Baltic is involved, one might even
put Sweden on Ing’s itinerary.

References and further reading: See Wolfgang Krause, “Ing,” Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen, phil.-hist.-Kl., 10 (1944):

Also see Henrik Schück, “Ingunar Frey,” Fornvännen 10 (1940): 289–296, which argued that Ingun was the earth; Franz Rolf Schröder, Untersuchungen zur germanischen und vergleichenden Religionsgeschichte, vol. 1: Ingunar-Frey (Tübingen: J. C. B. Mohr [P. Siebeck], 1941), which argued for Ingun as a fertility goddess associated with a holy tree, and Walter Baetke, Yngvi und die Ynglingar: Eine quellenkritische Untersuchung über das nordische “Sakralkönigtum,” Sitzungsberichte der sächsischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig, Phil.-hist.-Kl., 109:3 (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1964), which argued that the materials concerning Frey and the Ynglingar cannot be used to advance a notion of sacral kingship.
INGUNAR-FREY
Name for Frey.
This form of Frey’s name is found in Lokasenna, stanza 43, where Byggvir uses
it of his master, and in the so-called Great Saga of St. Olaf, where it is said that
Thjódólf of Hvin’s Ynglinga tal traces the ancestors of King Rögnvald of Vestfold
“back to Ingunar-Frey, as pagans called their god.” Thjódólf’s poem is retained
in Snorri Sturluson’s Ynglinga saga, where Snorri refers to Yngvi-Frey. Clearly
the two forms of the name are related, and on a purely linguistic basis one would
say “Yngvi-Frey” has a Scandinavian form and “Ingunar-Frey” a West Germanic
form; Beowulf 1319 refers to the king of the Danes as frea Ingwina (lord of the
friends of Ing), and a figure named Ing is also found in the Old English Rune
Poem. However, Norse Ingunar cannot be directly equated with Old English Ing
wina, and what the Norse form means remains open to debate. Formally it looks
like a genitive singular (Ingun’s Frey), and scholars have speculated that Ingun
could have been the earth or some other female deity. There may also be an asso
ciation with the West Germanic people called the Ingvaeones.

C. B. Mohr [P. Siebeck], 1941), argued for Ingun as a fertility goddess associated with a holy tree.

INTERPRETATIO GERMANICA
“Germanic interpretation,” that is, the translation of the Roman days of the week by
the Germanic peoples at some point during the Migration Period.
Although the Roman weekdays were named after planets, the Germanic peoples
who undertook the translation seem to have relied on the Roman gods whose
names the planets bore and to have tried to equate those gods with their own. In
the cases of the sun and the moon, the translation was obvious: Sunday and
Monday. The other cases, however, were more difficult.
Dies Martis, the day following “Moon-day,” bore the name of Mars, god of
war and battle. The Germanic peoples equated him with *Tiwaz, who was to
become Ty ́r in Scandinavia and Tiw in England, whence Tuesday. Thus,
although about all Ty ́r does in the extant mythology is lose his hand to the wolf
Fenrir (and provide the gods with a laugh when he does so), we can surmise that
he derives from a warrior god of considerable importance.
Dies Mercurii bore the name of Mercury, who was associated with travel
and commerce (whence our words “mercantile” and “merchandise”). Mercury
carried forward a number of the traits of the Greek Hermes, who was known for
his cunning, taste for theft, invention of the lyre, and accompanying of the dead
to Hades. This set of characteristics fits Odin strikingly: He relies on cunning
and treachery; he is the thief of the mead of poetry and is deeply associated with
that craft (cf. the lyre of Hermes); he is associated with the dead (the einherjar)
and visits the abode of the dead (in Baldrs draumar). Mercury was associated
with commerce, to be sure, but he was also changeable (whence our word “mer
curial” in that meaning), as Odin certainly was. Odin therefore got the day of
Mercury, Old English Wodnesdæg, our Wednesday.
Dies Jovis carried in it the name of Jupiter, the head of the Roman pantheon,
heir to Zeus in the Greek pantheon. One of his accouterments was a thunderbolt
that he heaved across the sky, and this may have contributed to the choice of the
translation of his day into that of the thunderer, Thor, giving us Thursday.
Dies Veneris bore the name of Venus, goddess of love. The deity the Ger
manic peoples chose to render her name was at that time *Frija, and that gives
us Friday. *Frija was the predecessor of Frigg, however, not of Freyja.
Dies Saturni bore the name of Saturn, the old Roman harvest god. Curi
ously, the Germanic peoples do not seem to have equated him with any of their
gods. Our name “Saturday” reflects a simple borrowing of his name, as does
Dutch zaterdag. Scandinavian lördag/lørdag means “washday.”
These translations offer us some sense of both the stability and innovation
of the oral tradition that carried the mythology forward from the Migration
Period to the High Middle Ages, from somewhere near the northern border of the
Roman Empire to the Scandinavian outpost on Iceland. We see that Ty ́r has lost
202 Norse Mythology



most of the glory implied by the etymology of his name, which derives from the
same Indo-European root as the names of Zeus and Jupiter and of our word
“deity” (compare Latin deus); his predecessor may once have been a far greater
warrior than Ty ́r seems to be in the extant mythology. We surmise that the orig
inal Odin is seen in his fickle and cunning aspects, not in his role as lord of hosts
and ruler of the pantheon. Similarly, we surmise that the predecessor of Thor
might possibly once have been the head of the pantheon, and that the predeces
sor of Frigg may once have been inspired love the way Freyja does in the texts
that have come down to us.
Some of the variations of the names in the various Germanic languages are
also of interest. German Dienstag and Dutch dinsdag, “Tuesday,” are based on
an adjective thingsus, “protector of the thing or assembly,” used to describe the
war god, and this suggests that the predecessor of Ty ́r had a connection with law
ful assembly that is hardly to be seen in the god as we known him. German
Mittwoch, “Wednesday,” may suggest an aversion to Odin, but Dutch woensdag
and Scandinavian onsdag still retain Odin’s name. Ironically enough, in Iceland,
which bequeathed the mythology to us, the weekday names are not based on the
Germanic interpretation but are merely numbered (first day, second day, etc.). If
there was a special aversion to the names of the ancient deities at the time of the
conversion, it must have been short-lived.

INTERPRETATIO ROMANA
“Roman interpretation,” that is, translations of the Germanic gods into the Roman
equivalents.
Although Caesar has something to say about the Germanic gods, this notion
refers especially to Tacitus, Germania, chapter 9, in which Tacitus attempts a
discussion of gods, cult, and divination. Mercury, he says, receives the greatest
worship, even human sacrifice. Animals are sacrificed to Hercules and Mars, and
a portion of the Suebi sacrifice to Isis (an Egyptian goddess who was known to
the Romans), in what Tacitus regards as a ritual of foreign origin because of the
use of a ship.
In the Interpretatio Germanica, we know the Latin weekday names that were
being translated, but here we are on less-certain ground. Indeed, we cannot know
the extent to which the Interpretatio Romana represents Germanic peoples try
ing to equate their deities with Roman ones and Romans trying to figure out the
Germanic deities. We can make guesses about the reaction of Germanic peoples
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 203



to the iconography of Roman gods, and we can make guesses about the forms of
the myths that might have attended the Germanic gods, but the enterprise is dif
ficult. Still, when we bring into the picture the Interpretatio Germanica, which
presumably occurred a few centuries after Tacitus wrote, the presumed corre
spondences become fairly clear. In the Interpretatio Germanica Odin is the equiv
alent of Mercury, and Ty ́r is the equivalent of Mars. Hercules is not used in the
interpretatio, but we must believe that Thor was one of the principal deities of
the Germanic peoples, and, like Thor, Hercules was a renowned slayer of mon
sters. Thus, Tacitus tells us about just three gods, the same three who were
pressed into service when the days of the week were translated. Tacitus also tells
us about one goddess, whom he calls Isis, and in the Interpretatio Germanica only
one goddess was used, namely Frigg, for Venus. Even if Isis is not a rendering of
Frigg’s predecessor, the parallel of three males and one female is striking.

JÁRNSAXA (ARMED-WITH-AN-IRON-SWORD)
Giantess.
Hyndluljód, stanzas 35–38, tell of one “with greatly increased power, of the race
of gods,” born of nine giant maidens and therefore probably Heimdall. The list
of giantesses begins with Gjálp and Greip and ends with Járnsaxa. Snorri too has
a Járnsaxa, who is identified briefly in Skáldskaparmál as the mother of Magni,
the three-year-old prodigy who alone of the æsir is able to lift the leg of the life
less giant Hrungnir off Thor when Thor lies pinned under it after their duel.
Odin disparages the relationship when he says at the end of the story that Thor
did wrong to offer the splendid horse Gullfaxi to the boy, the son of a giantess,
rather than to himself, the father of Thor. Skáldskaparmál says that a valid ken
ning for Sif is “one who shares a man with Járnsaxa.”
See also Thor
JÁRNVID (IRON-WOODS)
Forest where giantesses live.
Völuspá, stanza 40, mentions one such giantess, almost certainly Angrboda:
To the east sat the old lady in Járnvid
And raised there the kinfolk of Fenrir.
204 Norse Mythology



In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri Sturluson paraphrases this
stanza:
An ogress lives east of Midgard in the forest called Járnvid. In that forest dwell
those troll women, who are called Járnvidjur (Ironwoodites). The old ogress
raises as her sons many giants and all in the form of a wolf, and from them come
wolves.
Stanza 3 of Háleygjatal, composed by the skald Eyvind Finnsson toward the
end of the tenth century, refers to a Járnvidja (Ironwoodite) who is apparently
Skadi.
See also Angrboda; Mánagarm
JÖRD (EARTH)
The earth, personified; consort of Odin and mother of Thor.
The Thor kenning “son of Jörd” is attested twice (with different words for “son”)
in skaldic poetry from the pagan period and is also found in the eddic poems
Lokasenna and Thrymskvida and in the thulur. In Skáldskaparmál, discussing
poetic diction, Snorri says that Thor may be called “son of Jörd” and that Jörd
may be called “one who shares a man with Frigg.” In Gylfaginning, after enu
merating the ásynjur and describing the valkyries, Snorri says that “Jörd, the
mother of Thor, and Rind, the mother of Váli, are numbered among the ásyn
jur.” Rind is certainly a giantess, and to be “numbered among the æsir” is to be
from some other group originally. Jörd must have been a giantess in the begin
ning. If so, Odin’s marriage (or, more likely, sexual relationship outside mar
riage, perhaps not even a willing one on her part) to Jörd should be regarded as
parallel to his other strategically minded relationships with giantesses. Rind is a
good example; he seduced her by means of magic (seid) in order to sire Váli, the
avenger of Baldr. It is instructive to think of Thor in this context. Is he the ulti
mate avenger?
Earlier in Gylfaginning Snorri has a confused discussion of Jörd, in connec
tion with Alfödr (Odin):
The earth was his daughter and his wife. With her he made [sic] the first son,
and that is Ása-Thor.
Snorri’s use of the definite article in this passage suggests a desire to keep
separate the earth and the goddess Jörd (Earth). A few lines later Snorri gives a
genealogy of Jörd: She is the daughter of Annarr (Second) and Nótt (Night),
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 205



daughter of the giant Nörfi or Narfi. Yet Jörd, without the definite article, is ordi
narily regarded as Thor’s mother. Völuspá, stanza 50, calls Thor the “son of Hló
dyn,” an etymologically unclear name that must be the same as Jörd.
JÖTUNHEIMAR (GIANT-WORLDS)
That part of the cosmos inhabited by giants.
The fact that this term is plural may indicate that there were multiple areas
inhabited by giants, as opposed to the single enclosure of the gods (Ásgard). In
the world of humans there were multiple places where the trolls might live:
mountains, forests, and so forth—any of the unsettled areas surrounding the
farmstead.
KVASIR
God whose blood is used to make the mead of poetry.
Toward the end of the tenth century, the skald Einar Helgason skálaglamm, in
his Vellekla, referred to poetry as “Kvasir’s blood.” This accords with the story
of the origin of the mead of poetry, as told by Snorri Sturluson in the Skáldskap
armál section of his Edda. The peace between the æsir and vanir was sealed
when both groups spat into a kettle. The gods wished to make the token of their
peace more permanent, so they fashioned a man out of this spittle. He was
Kvasir, and “he is so wise, that no one can ask him a question he cannot
answer.” He went about the world spouting wisdom and was murdered by the
dwarfs Fjalar and Galar, who mixed his blood with honey and made the mead of
poetry from it. They told the æsir, in one of the few really funny lines in this
mythology, that he had choked on his wisdom. Apparently this outrageous lie
did not trouble the æsir.
In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri described Loki’s attempts to
evade the vengeance of the æsir after the killing of Baldr. He changed himself
into a salmon and jumped in the river, but when the æsir arrived at his distant
hideout, the first of the æsir to approach was Kvasir, “the wisest of all the æsir.”
He recognized in the ashes of a fire the form of a net—a technology yet to be
invented, according to the myth—and the æsir made a net to help capture Loki.
Here we have one of those discrepancies in chronology that characterize myth
in general and this mythology in particular: Kvasir had to die in what I call, in
chapter 2, the “near past,” that is, early on in the mythology, since the incorpo
ration of vanir and æsir and Odin’s use of poetry are part of the mythic present.
At the same time, Loki’s punishment is fairly late in the mythic present, so
Kvasir ought to be long dead. Yet here he is. This Kvasir is consistent with the
206 Norse Mythology



one Snorri presents in chapter 4 of his Ynglinga saga, in which the Æsir-Vanir
War is presented historically. There Kvasir, the wisest of the vanir, is sent to the
æsir as a pledge of peace at the end of the hostilities.
See also Æsir-Vanir War; Mead of Poetry
LÆRAD
Tree, almost certainly the world tree.
The major source is Grímnismál, stanzas 25–26:
25. Heidrún is the name of the goat, who stands at the hall of Herjafödr [Odin]
And bites from the limbs of Lærad.
She will fill a barrel with the bright mead;
That drink can never run out.
26. Eikthyrnir is the name of a hart, who stands at the hall of Herjafödr [Odin]
And bites from the limbs of Lærad.
Yet from his horns it drips into Hvergelmir,
Thence all waters have their ways.
In Gylfaginning Snorri Sturluson paraphrased these lines. He says that the
goat Heidrún “bites foliage off the limbs of that tree, which is famous and which
is called Lærad.” She provides endless mead, and the hart Eikthyrnir is the
source of numerous rivers, according to Snorri.
The reasons for equating Lærad with Yggdrasil begin with Lærad ’s location
at Odin’s hall, which would be at the center of the cosmos. Yggdrasil too has ani
mals about it, although they are perhaps more directly threatening than Heidrún
and Eikthyrnir. Hvergelmir too is associated with both.
The form of the name varies, and many etymologies have been proposed. If,
however, the first component is Læ-, “betrayal,” the Norse would have under
stood the name as “arranger of betrayal,” and such a name might just fit for
Yggdrasil, Odin’s steed, that is, the “horse” on which he was hung and was given
in a self-sacrifice.

LAUFEY
Loki’s mother, used in the matronymic formula “Loki, son of Laufey.”
The name is not found in skaldic poetry. In eddic poetry “son of Laufey” is a fre
quent kenning for Loki (Lokasenna, stanza 52—in which Loki uses it of him
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 207



self—and Thrymskvida, stanzas 18, 20). In Gylfaginning Snorri tells us when he
introduces Loki that he was “the son of Fárbauti the giant and of Laufey or Nál,”
and in Skáldskaparmál he says that “son of Laufey” is a valid kenning for Loki
(along with “son of Fárbauti” and “son of Nál”). Snorri refers to Loki darkly as
“son of Laufey” on a couple of occasions, as when he calls Loki “the one who
makes most evil,” or when he says that Thökk, the hag who would not weep
Baldr out of Hel, was thought to have been Loki, the son of Laufey.
Laufey herself is found in no myths. Her name looks as though it should
mean “Leaf-island,” but that would be a strange name. Sörla tháttr says she was
slender and feeble, and for that reason was called Nál (Needle), but the late date
of the text makes this piece of information suspect. What is most striking about
Laufey is that we always read of Loki Laufeyjarson and never of Loki Fárbauta
son (to use the grammatically correct forms). There were no last names in old
Scandinavia (indeed, there are in principle no last names in Iceland today). One
had a given name and a patronymic, except in those rare cases when the father
was unknown or unsavory, in which case one had a matronymic. The fact that
his father Fárbauti was a giant was presumably something that Loki—and
Odin—would rather not be reminded of, especially since in this mythology kin
ship is ideally reckoned exclusively through male lines. (Consider the fact that
Odin has a giant mother and that sex with giantesses is one of his weapons.) Was
Laufey, then, a goddess? She is listed with goddesses in one of the thulur, and
having a goddess as a mother might have been what enabled Loki to be “enu
merated among the æsir,” as Snorri put it in Gylfaginning. If Laufey was a god
dess, then Loki’s genealogy as offspring of a giant father and a goddess mother
would be the same as that of his children with Angrboda, namely the Midgard
serpent, Fenrir the wolf, and Hel, all great enemies of the gods, and this might
help explain his ultimate allegiance.
See also Loki
LÉTTFETI (LIGHT-FOOT)
Horse name found in Grímnismál, stanza 30, which lists the horses the æsir ride
each day when they go to make judgments at Yggdrasil.
Snorri Sturluson includes Léttfeti in his list of the horses of the æsir in Gylfagin
ning but does not assign the horse to any specific god. Léttfeti is also listed in
the thulur for horses.
208 Norse Mythology



LÍF AND LÍFTHRASIR
The humans who will survive Ragnarök and repopulate the world.
In Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 44, Odin asks what humans will live after Fimbulvetr
has passed. Vafthrúdnir replies in stanza 45.
Líf and Lífthrasir, still they will conceal themselves
In Hoddmímir’s forest;
The morning dews they will have as food for themselves,
From them people will be nourished.
In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri Sturluson paraphrases and
quotes this stanza, adding the information that the lineage of Líf and Lífthrasir
will be so great that the entire world will be populated.
See also Hoddmímir’s Forest; Ragnarök
LIT (COLOR, COUNTENANCE)
Dwarf killed by Thor at Baldr’s funeral, according to Snorri.
The killing of Lit, which appears only in Gylfaginning, appears almost to be an
incidental. The gods have had to send for Hyrrokkin in order to launch Baldr’s
immobile funeral ship, and Baldr’s body is aboard, as is that of his wife Nanna,
who according to Snorri died of grief:
Then Thor stood by and consecrated the pyre with Mjöllnir, and before his feet
ran a certain dwarf; he is called Lit. And Thor kicked with his foot and knocked
him into the fire, and he was burned up.
Lit is indeed listed among the dwarfs in the catalog of dwarfs (in stanza 12)
and among the dwarfs in the thulur. His name appears to be the common noun
for “color, countenance” which is one of the features endowed (in the plural) to
Ask and Embla by the gods in Völuspá, stanza 18, but has no particularly logical
association with dwarfs. There is, however, apparently a second Lit, one who is
mentioned by Bragi Boddason the Old, who is taken to be the first skald: “grasp
offerer of the men of ancient Lit,” that is, one who offers opportunities to
grapple. This is a Thor kenning, and the race with whom Thor would wrestle
would be giants, not dwarfs, and if the men of Lit are giants, so was Lit himself.
Furthermore, in one of the manuscripts of Thorbjörn dísarskáld’s stanza directed
to Thor, the god is praised for killing Lit; in the other manuscripts, it is Lút. So
was Lit a giant who became a dwarf, or were there two beings with this name?
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 209



The evidence hardly permits us to draw a conclusion, but it would not have been
inappropriate for Thor to have killed a giant in some earlier version of the
funeral of Baldr.
See also Baldr; Dwarfs; Thor References and further reading: Otto Höfler, “Balders Bestattung und die
nordischen Felszeichnungen,” Anzeiger der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, phil.-hist. Kl., 88 (1951): 343–372, argued pictorial continuity between Bronze Age rock carvings and the carvings in the Icelandic hall described in Úlf’s Húsdrápa and then went on to explain Lit as a cult dancer cavorting in some old pictorial cult scene and subsequently misinterpreted; needless to say, this is a bit speculative.
LJÓDATAL
Section of the poem Hávamál, usually thought of as comprising stanzas 146–164,
although it would be possible to construe 138–164 as a single section.
The Ljódatal (Enumeration of Chants), spoken in the first person by Odin, lists
the effects of 18 songs or chants that work magic, although the charms them
selves are not given. Odin is supposed to have obtained nine powerful songs from
his giant maternal uncle in the course of his self-sacrifice, and there does seem to
be a kind of qualitative difference between the first of nine chants and those that
follow. The first two charms appear to have to do with cures, the next several
with battle (e.g., charms for dulling enemies’ blades, diverting arrows, redirecting
enmities to those from whom they originated, quelling fire in a hall, which would
have to do with battle if one thinks of the burnings in the sagas and Icelandic his
torical record of the Sturlung Age). The eighth is rather strange, ironic even, in
the mouth of Odin: “Wherever hate grows, among the sons of a prince, that I can
quickly repair.” In the ninth Odin announces that he can still storms and high
seas. With the tenth there is something of a break, since he says that he can cause
witches not to be able to find their way back to their shapes and minds. The tenth
and twelfth are battle charms, but the tenth at least differs from the earlier
charms in that it does not work on objects (swords, fetters, flames) but, rather,
offers blanket protection for his followers. The twelfth announces an Odinic con
nection with hanged men. From the fourteenth onward there seems to be a sort
of progression, from mythological knowledge, the acquisition of important qual
ities (wealth for the æsir, success for the elves, cognition for Odin), to sexual mat
ters and powers of seduction. The last he will never teach to maid or man’s wife,
“only to the one who casts an arm about him or is his sister.” The conjunction
“or” in this language can sometimes mean “and,” which would mean that only
an unthinkable act of incest would cause this charm to be revealed. Powers of
seduction have been a persistent subject in the poem, as evidenced by the so
210 Norse Mythology



called Odin’s examples, of which the
one with a positive outcome resulted
in the acquisition of the mead of
poetry. In Hárbardsljód Odin boasts of
having his way with giant girls. Per
haps the most important use of powers
of seduction (or rape) comes in the
Baldr story, in which his solution to
the murder of his son and heir by
another son is to sire an avenger, Váli,
on a giantess.
LODDFÁFNISMÁL
Section of the poem Hávamál, usually
thought of as comprising stanzas
111–137.
This section gets its name from a
refrain repeated 20 times: “I advise
you now, Loddfáfnir, / that you learn
counsels, / you will have use of them,
if you learn them, / they will be good
for you, if you obtain them.” Lodd
fáfnir is otherwise unknown, and the
name is not helpful. The first compo
nent, Lodd-, may mean something
like “shaggy,” and the second is iden
tical with the name of the giant Fáfnir
in heroic tradition, who changed him
self into a dragon to hoard the gold he
had obtained by killing his brother and
who in turn was killed by Sigurd.
What a “Shaggy-Fáfnir” might be (or a
shaggy dragon or shaggy shape
changer) remains unknown.
The section begins with a verse
using language that could relate to the
exchange of wisdom in sacral contexts
and that is clearly anchored in the
mythology.

It is time to recite
at the seat of the sage by the well of Urd:
I saw and was silent,
I saw and I considered,
I listened to the speeches of men;
I heard runes being judged,
nor were they silent about counsels, at the hall of Hár,
in the hall of Hár;
I heard them say this.
I have rendered the verb πylja as “recite,” although “chant” might be
another acceptable translation. The noun I rendered with “sage,” thulr, is
related; its cognate in Old English, πyle, means “orator.” The identity of the
speaker is not clear. If, however, we accept that the title Hávamál really does
mean “Words of Hár [the High One],” then Odin may be speaking. Alternatively,
we may be hearing either a narrator’s voice or, perhaps, that of Loddfáfnir. In any
case, the remainder of the section consists of counsels (ráƒ) introduced by the
refrain. Many of these counsels are similar to those of the gnomic section of the
poem (which includes such aphorisms as “Keep and make friends”; “Be cautious
when drinking beer”; “Limit conversation with foolish people”), but certain of
them, especially toward the end of the list, relate easily to myths about Odin.
Thus, for example, Loddfáfnir is advised to treat guests generously and to heed
the words of grizzle-haired men, counsel that would have been useful to Geirröd
when Odin visited that human king and was maltreated (Grímnismál).
LÓDUR
Enigmatic god who helps endow Ask and Embla with life.
Lódur is found only in the version of cosmogony preserved in Völuspá. Three
æsir have found Ask and Embla on the land, fateless and capable of little. In
stanza 19, Odin, Hœnir, and Lódur endow them with three characteristics.
Lódur’s gift is blood, ruddiness, or vital warmth, and also good coloring. In the
Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri Sturluson adds some details and
changes others. The creator gods in his version are the sons of Bor (i.e., Odin,
Vili, and Vé). The third, who is structurally equivalent to Lódur, gives appear
ance, speech, hearing, and vision.
Except in the Odin kenning “Lódur’s friend,” Lódur is unknown, and the
etymology is unclear. Many attempts have been made to understand Lódur as an
alternate name for some other god, most often Loki. The main argument in favor
of Loki is that he is known to travel with Odin and Hœnir, as when they
encounter Thjazi or Andvari. Odin is also known as “Lopt’s friend,” and Lopt is
212 Norse Mythology



definitely a Loki name. There have also been attempts to associate Loki with
Lódur through the runic name Logathore, but this is problematic.
Besides Loki, Frey has been proposed as the underlying identity of Lódur.
According to this scenario, Lódur would have been a fertility figure.
See also Ask and Embla; Hœnir References and further reading: Edgar C. Polomé has contributed a study focusing exclusively on Lódur: “Quelques notes à propos du dieu énigmatique scandinave Lóƒurr,” Revue Belge 33 (1955), and his “Some Comments on Völuspá, Stanzas 17–18,” in Old Norse Literature and Mythology: A Symposium, ed. Edgar C. Polomé (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1969), 265–290, is also relevant; it associates Lódur with the vanir.
LOFN
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists her eighth in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the æsir
and says, “She is so gracious and good to call on that she gets permission from
Alfödr [Odin] or Frigg for the intercourse of people, men and women, although
otherwise it would be banned or forbidden; because of that lof [praise] is derived
from her name, and that which is much lofat [praised] by people.” Scholars fol
low Snorri in accepting a connection between the name Lofn and the root lof-,
“praise.” Although Lofn herself is unattested elsewhere, her name turns up fre
quently as the base word in woman kennings in skaldic poetry. As with many of
the other minor goddesses, some scholars believe that she may just be Frigg
under another name.
See also Alfödr; Frigg
LOGI (FIRE)
Opponent of the æsir in the myth of Thor’s visit to Útgarda-Loki.
When the æsir reach the hall of Útgarda-Loki, the giant informs them that no
one can stay who does not excel at some kind of skill or knowledge. Loki
responds first: “I have that talent, which I am wholly ready to test, that there is
no one here inside who can eat his food faster than I can.” Útgarda-Loki agrees
that that would indeed be a talent, and he calls forth Logi for an eating contest
with Loki.
Then a wooden platter is taken and carried into the center of the hall, laden
with meat. Loki sits himself at one end and Logi at the other, and each eats as
fast as he can, and they meet in the middle of the platter. Loki has eaten all the
meat off the bones, but Logi has eaten all the meat off the bones and also the
platter, and it seems to everyone that Loki has lost the contest.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 213



Only later does Útgarda-Loki reveal to the æsir: “The one named Logi was
wildfire, and he burned the tray no more slowly than the meat.” The æsir lose
the other contests as well, failing to recognize not only the word for “fire” but
also words for “mind” and “old age.”
Logi is named as one of the three elemental sons of Fornjót in Fundinn
Noregr (Norway Found), as the beginning of Orkneyinga saga (The Saga of the
Orkney Islanders) is sometimes called, and in a section of Flateyjarbók called
Hversu Noregr byggdisk (How Norway Was Settled). There appears to be no con
nection between this tradition and the story of the gods’ visit to Útgarda-Loki.
See also Loki; Útgarda-Loki
LOKASENNA
Eddic poem.
Lokasenna (Loki’s Verbal Duel) is found only in Codex Regius of the Poetic
Edda, between Hymiskvida and Thrymskvida. The compiler of the manuscript
therefore understood it as a Thor poem. Lokasenna consists of 65 stanzas mostly
in ljóƒaháttr; a few stanzas are in galdralag and have quite a heightened effect.
The poem is preceded by a prose header, interrupted in a few places by prose sen
tences tying the stanzas together, and followed by a prose colophon.
The prose header follows the rubric “About Ægir and the Gods.” It states
that Ægir, having obtained the kettle “as was just told” (i.e., in Hymiskvida) to
brew beer, had invited the gods to a feast. All but Thor were there, many æsir
and elves, and the room was lit by gold instead of a fire. The beer served itself,
and the place was one of great sanctuary. Ægir’s servants won much praise, and
Loki could not stand to hear that and killed one of them, Fimafeng. The gods
chased him away, but he returned.
The poem itself consists of a series of dialogues between Loki and various
characters, verbal exchanges in which Loki for the most part tells the god to
whom he is speaking to shut up and then reveals some unflattering fact about
that god. The first exchange, however, is not with a god but with Eldir, a sur
viving servant of Ægir. Loki learns that the gods are discussing their prowess,
states his intention to enter the hall, and dismisses Eldir as a verbal opponent.
In the remainder of the poem Loki jousts verbally with 14 of the gods and god
desses. Here is a catalog of the deities and the major insults directed toward
them: Bragi, cowardice; Odin, swore blood-brotherhood with Loki, often gave
victory to the weaker; Idun, slept with the killer of her brother; Gefjon, sold her
self for a bauble; Frigg, slept with Vili and Vé (and Loki takes responsibility for
Baldr’s death); Freyja, slept with her brother; Njörd, abused by Hymir’s daugh
ters, sired Frey on his sister; Ty ́r, lost his hand to Fenrir, cuckolded by Loki; Frey,
214 Norse Mythology



abandoned his sword to obtain Gerd; Byggvir, cowardice; Heimdall, dirty wet
back; Skadi, Loki participated in killing her father and has slept with her; Sif,
cuckolded Thor with Loki; Beyla, filthy dairymaid; Thor, cowered in some
giant’s glove, probably Skry ́mir’s, and could not open the bag of provisions
strapped shut by Skry ́mir. There are also accusations directed at Loki, most
accusing him of ergi (sexual perversion), some reminding him of the binding of
his son the wolf. The poem is finally resolved when Loki retires from the hall
under the threat of a blow from Thor’s hammer: “I spoke before the æsir, / I
spoke before the elves, / what my mind incited me to; / but for you alone / I will
go out, / for I know that you will strike” (stanza 65). In the final stanza Loki tells
Ægir that this is his final party and that he will lose his possessions to fire.
The prose colophon follows a rubric “About Loki” and tells an abbreviated
version of the story that Snorri presents as the vengeance taken by the æsir on
Loki for Baldr’s death. Loki flees and hides in the form of a salmon but is captured
and bound under a poisonous snake. Sigyn, Loki’s wife, catches the poison in a
bowl, but when she goes to empty it, Loki struggles, and that causes earthquakes.
Many of Loki’s accusations are known from other sources, such as the incest
of the vanir, the possession of Frigg by Vili and Vé, Ty ́r’s loss of his hand, and
Thor’s journey to Útgarda-Loki. Many others are to be found only here, includ
ing many of the accusations of sexual misbehavior directed at the female mem
bers of the æsir. Byggvir and Beyla are known only from this poem. Although
some observers have found it difficult to imagine that believers would tell and
listen to such scurrilous material about their gods, there are analogues from
other religions. Furthermore, an argument for a late origin for the poem would
be more easily built on its language and possible analogues from classical litera
ture, which would not have been known in Iceland before the twelfth century.
On the other hand, the primacy of Thor over Loki would accord with Thor’s
prominence in the waning decades of paganism, and if the real point of the poem
is not just that Thor alone can make Loki stop but rather that Thor can do so
that is, if the poem ultimately pits Loki’s mouth against Thor’s hammer—it
would be consistent with many of the other mythological poems of the Poetic
Edda, which involve conflict and ultimately tell us about hierarchy: Odin is bet
ter than giants, men, and even Thor with words (Vafthrúdnismál, Grímnismál,
and Hárbardsljód), and Thor is better than Alvíss with words (Alvíssmál). On
this one occasion, at least, Loki is better than all the gods with words, but Thor
can silence him. It is instructive to compare this myth with that of Thor’s duel
with Hrungnir, for in both Odin is unable to prevent the extension of hospital
ity to someone who ought not to receive it, both recipients say things that
should not be said (in Hrungnir’s case that he will possess Ásgard and Freyja),
and in both cases Thor’s hammer gets Odin out of this tight spot.

LOKI
Trickster figure, lives among the gods but will fight with the giants at Ragnarök.
In my view the single most significant line about Loki in the sources comes at
the end of the catalog of æsir in the Gylfaginning section of the Edda of Snorri
Sturluson: Loki is “also numbered among the æsir,” that is, he is counted as one
of them even though he may actually not be one. Indeed, given the principle of
reckoning kinship along paternal lines only, Loki is no god but a giant, since he
has a giant father, Fárbauti. His mother, Laufey or Nál, may well have been one
of the æsir, but that should not count. And Loki is himself the father of three

monsters, the Midgard serpent, the
wolf Fenrir, and Hel, by the ogress
Angrboda. With his wife Sigyn he
has the son(s) Nari and/or Narfi.
It seems that Loki’s allegiance
is for the most part with the æsir
during the mythic present, but that
in the mythic past, when he mated
with Angrboda, and in the mythic
future, at Ragnarök, he is un
abashedly against them. In the
mythic present he travels with
Odin and Hœnir in both the Thjazi
and Andvari stories, and he travels
with Thor in the Útgarda-Loki
story and in one version of the
story of Thor’s visit to Geirröd.
Often it is Loki whose actions set
the complications of a story in
motion: For example, he is stuck to
Thjazi and agrees to deliver Idun
and her apples; he is starved by
Geirröd and agrees to deliver Thor
without his weapons. Sometimes
when things go wrong the æsir
assume it is Loki’s fault even when
no blame has entered the story, as
in the story of the master builder of
the wall around Ásgard. But in that
story and others, he is willing to fix
things; for example, he causes the
six precious objects of the gods to be made in connection with replacing Sif’s
hair, which he had mysteriously cut off. (These six objects, made by dwarfs, are
Sif’s golden headpiece, Odin’s spear Gungnir and his ring Draupnir, Thor’s ham
mer, and Frey’s boar Gullinborsti and his ship Skídbladnir.)
Not infrequently Loki sacrifices his honor (or worse) to help the æsir, as
when he changes himself into a mare to seduce the master builder’s horse and
bears a foal from it, not something that would enhance a man’s reputation in the
hyper-masculine society that was medieval Iceland. Similarly, dressing as the
handmaiden of Freyja (that is, of Thor very reluctantly in drag) would leave him

open to charges of effeminacy. Then there is the method he used to make Skadi
laugh when the gods were compensating her for the loss of her father, Thjazi: He
tied a rope around his testicles and the beard of a she-goat and both bleated as
Loki fell into Skadi’s lap. Loki shares this sexual ambiguity with Odin, who
practiced the effeminate magic called seid, and in fact the two were blood broth
ers. It seems likely to me that Odin entered into blood-brotherhood with Loki in
an attempt to head off future mortal conflict with him. If so, Odin failed.
Loki’s unequivocally negative actions should probably begin with his mys
terious struggle with Heimdall, apparently over the Brísinga men, which Loki
may have stolen. This incident is obscure, but his vicious insulting of the gods
and goddesses in Lokasenna is crystal clear. Worse yet is his arranging the death
of Baldr, the first death among the æsir and almost certainly the event that leads
inevitably to Ragnarök. I would assign both Lokasenna and Baldr’s death to the
last stages of the mythological present, when Loki is beginning to reveal his true
colors. Lokasenna and Snorri’s Edda agree that Loki was bound in revenge,
either for the reviling of the gods or for his role in Baldr’s death. But in the early
stages of the mythic future he will break free. And according to Völuspá, stanza
51, he will pilot a ship from the east full of Muspell’s peoples, the enemies and
ultimate destroyers of the gods and the cosmos.
In that sense we may say that Loki has a chronological component: He is the
enemy of the gods in the far mythic past, and he reverts to this status as the
mythic future approaches and arrives. In the mythic present he is ambiguous,
“numbered among the æsir.”

Everyone agrees that there was never any cult of Loki, and everyone agrees that he was important, but beyond that it is difficult to generalize. Older (and even some modern) critics thought he could be associated with natural phenomena, such as fire (Wagner made of him Loge in the Ring Cycle) or air, the latter based on his name Lopt. The most consistently useful strand of the scholarship reads Loki against the trickster figures of Native American and African traditions: Trickster thinks only of the present and never of the future, is creative but destructive at the same time, and often has a connection with sexuality. Such a view characterizes the book of Jan de Vries, The Problem of Loki, FF Communications, 110 (Helsinki: Suomalainen tiedeakatemia, 1933), who brings out the dual aspects of culture hero and trickster. A later book in English is that of Anna Birgitta Rooth, Loki in Scandinavian Mythology, Skrifter utgivna av Kungliga humanistiska vetenskapssamfundet i Lund, 61 (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1969). Using an extremely strict historical-geographical method and regarding anything found elsewhere as having been borrowed into Scandinavia, Rooth is left with

a spider as the hypothetical Loki. Ulf Drobin, “Myth and Epical Motifs in the Loki-Research,” Temenos 3 (1968): 19–39, goes beyond a research survey to read Loki as the player of an essentially epic (i.e., narrative) role. Still the most useful recent piece is that of Jens Peter Schjødt, “Om Loke endnu engang,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 96 (1981): 49–86, which sees Loki as a mediator. Schjødt contributed a brief but concise history of Loki research in the encyclopedia article “Loki” in Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia, ed. Philip Pulsiano et al., Garland Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages, 1; Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, 934 (New York and London: Garland Publishing, 1993), 394–395.
LOPT
Alternate name for Loki.
The name is common in eddic poetry and is also used by the early skalds. When
Snorri Sturluson describes Loki in his catalog in the Gylfaginning section of his
Edda, he begins by calling him “Loki or Lopt.”
This alternate Loki name appears to be a masculine form of a feminine noun
meaning “sky,” and it seems certain to me that medieval Scandinavians would
have understood it as related to the sky. Perhaps we should think of Loki flying
about in Freyja’s falcon coat.
See also Loki
MAGNI (THE STRONG)
Son of Thor.
The tenth-century skaldic Thórsdrápa, by Eilíf Godrúnarson, uses “father of
Magni” as a kenning for Thor (stanza 21), as does the eddic poem Hárbardsljód
(stanzas 9 and 53). Magni is mentioned on only one other occasion in poetry, in
Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 51, but it is an important occasion. Odin has just asked
the giant Vafthrúdnir who will control the possessions of the gods:
Vídar and Váli will inhabit the holy places of the gods,
When Surt’s fire dies down;
Módi and Magni will have Mjöllnir
And will bring about a cessation of killing.
Snorri knew this myth and employed it in his account of Ragnarök and its
aftermath. Magni and his bother Módi are, then, second-generation gods—like
Vídar and Váli and Höd and Baldr—who will survive Ragnarök and participate in
the new world order. They will possess Mjöllnir, Thor’s hammer, with which
220 Norse Mythology



Thor killed countless giants. If my translation of the last line above is correct,
Mjöllnir will help them end the ceaseless cycle of slayings that had character
ized the mythological present. The text is difficult at this point, however, and
many editors and translators choose to alter it to read “at the cessation of the
battle of Vingnir (Thor).” In either case, their possession of Mjöllnir is part of the
larger pattern here of continuity from the old mythological order to the new one.
Vídar and Váli are both gods of vengeance, and Magni too undertakes an act
in the mythological present that, even if it is not vengeance, is at least aimed at
his father’s opponent in the aftermath of a battle. At the end of Thor’s duel with
Hrungnir, which we have from Skáldskaparmál in Snorri’s Edda, Thor lies
pinned under the lower leg of the dead giant:
All the æsir came up, when they heard that Thor had fallen, and were going to
get the leg off him, but they couldn’t move it at all. Then Magni arrived, the son
of Thor and Járnsaxa. He was three nights old [three years old, according to
some manuscripts of Snorri’s Edda]. He threw the leg off Thor and said: “What
a pity, father, that I came so late; I think I could have smacked the giant down
into Hel with my fist, if I had encountered him.” Thor stood up and greeted his
son well and said that he would become a great man. “I wish,” he said, “to give
you the horse Gullfaxi, which Hrungnir possessed.” But Odin spoke up and said
that Thor did wrong when he gave the horse to the son of a giantess and not to
his father.
Járnsaxa (Armed-with-an-iron-sword) as the giantess mother of Magni is
known only from Snorri, who elsewhere in Skáldskaparmál says that a kenning
for Sif, Thor’s legitimate wife, is “one who shares a man with Járnsaxa.” Other
wise Járnsaxa is known as one of the nine giant mothers of Heimdall (Hynd
luljód, stanza 37). Having a giantess mother increases Magni’s similarities with
Vídar and Váli, the sons of Odin and the giantesses Gríd and Rind respectively.
Furthermore, Magni’s precocious acts as an infant find a parallel in the
vengeance taken by Baldr’s brother, presumably Váli, when one night old
(Völuspá, stanza 32).

MÁNAGARM (MOON-DOG)
Monstrous hound, destroyer of the moon or sun according to Snorri Sturluson.
Garm turns up often as the base word in kennings, where it means “destroyer,”
and Mánagarm thus has the form of a kenning, for the first part of the name is
just the genitive case of the word “moon.” Only Snorri knows about Mánagarm,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 221



but his description of the beast, early in Gylfaginning, is memorable. He has just
mentioned an old giantess, one of the Járnvidjur (Ironwoodites) who gives birth
to many sons, all in the form of wolves.
And it is said, that the most powerful of that family will be the one who is
called Mánagarm. He is filled with the life of all people who die, and he will
swallow the heavenly bodies, and bespatter with blood the heaven and all the
sky. Thence the sun will lose its shine, and winds will not be gentle and will
roar hither and yon.
Snorri is obviously following Völuspá, stanzas 40 and 41, and he quotes
them directly after this passage. Stanza 40 agrees that a Járnvidja gives birth to
the families of Fenrir, and that one of them will swallow the tungl, “in the form
of a troll.” How Snorri got from this stanza to Mánagarm is unknown.
I have left tungl untranslated because it truly is ambiguous in this context.
It means something like “heavenly body,” and from the end of Snorri’s prose
passage we would think that here it means “sun.” Mánagarm as “Destroyer-of
the-moon,” on the other hand, suggests the opposite.
See also Garm
MÁNI (MOON)
The moon, personified.
In Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 22, Odin asks the wise giant Vafthrúdnir whence the
moon and sun came to travel over people. The giant responds in stanza 23:
Mundilfœri he is called, the father of Máni
And also of Sól the same;
Into heaven shall they turn each day,
So that people can reckon years.
Reginsmál, stanza 23, uses “sister of Máni” as a kenning for the sun. There
also, however, seem to be kennings in the skaldic corpus for giantesses suggest
ing a marriage or sexual union between Máni and a giantess, for example,
“desired woman of Máni” used by Guthorm sindri. If Máni had such a relation
ship with a giantess, it has left no other trace in the extant mythology.
Snorri concocts a somewhat different story: Mundilfœri is a man who had
two children who were so beautiful that he named them Máni and Sól (i.e.,
Moon and Sun), and the gods punished this act of pride by placing the children
in heaven to serve the actual heavenly bodies, which the gods had created. Máni
222 Norse Mythology



controls the motion of the moon and its waxings and wanings. He took two
human children up from earth, Bil and Hjúki, and they accompany him and can
be seen from earth.
As part of the creation of the æsir, that is, the cosmos, Máni must be destroyed
at Ragnarök, but this is not explicitly stated, except perhaps by Snorri, who tells
about Mánagarm, who will swallow a heavenly body that may be the moon.
See also Bil and Hjúki; Mánagarm; Mundilfœri; Sól. References and further reading: Although Máni obviously figured prominently in nineteenth-century solar mythological readings of the mythology, such readings have faded away. An exception was Leonhard Franz, “Die Geschichte vom Monde in der Snorra-Edda” Mitteilungen der Islandfreunde 10
(1922–1923): 45–48, which argued for a kind of lunar mythology. Ernst Alfred Philippson, Germanisches Heidentum bei den Angelsachsen, Kölner anglistische Arbeiten, 4 (Leipzig: B. Tauchnitz, 1929), nicely surveyed the evidence for the worship of the moon and sun among the Germanic tribes who migrated to England. Rudolf Much, however, had the last word. His “Mondmythologie und Wissenschaft,” Archiv für Religionswissenschaft 37 (1941–1942): 231–261, shows pretty convincingly that moon mythology cannot have been of much importance.
MANNUS (MAN)
Figure involved in the origin of the Germanic peoples according to the Germania of
Tacitus, probably the first human being.
In chapter 2 of his Germania, Tacitus writes the following statement:
They celebrate in ancient songs . . . a god Tuisto, born from the earth, and his
son Mannus as the origin and founders of their people. To Mannus they assign
three sons, from whose names are called the Ingaevones near the ocean, those
in the center as Herminones, and the rest Istaevones.
The name Tuisto appears to have in it the root of the word “two,” and this
has reminded many observers of Ymir, whose name meant something like
“doubled.” Ymir sired the races of frost-giants through monstrous hermaphroditic
conception, and Tuisto may well have done something similar. Mannus (Man)
would be the first human being, whose procreation would be done in the usual
human way. From the first human come the Germanic tribes.
See also Ymir

MARDÖLL
Name for Freyja.
Snorri says in Gylfaginning that Freyja has many names because she took on dif
ferent names among the various peoples she encountered when she went to
search for her missing husband, Ód. There is no other direct evidence that
Mardöll is a name for Freyja except the kenning “tear of Mardöll” for gold, which
relies on the story of Freyja weeping golden tears for her missing husband Ód.
The meaning of the name Mardöll is disputed.

MATRES AND MATRONES
Groups of females worshipped in the
Germanic area that came into contact
with Rome during the first five centuries
or so C.E.
Matres is Latin for “mothers,” and
matrones is Latin for “matrons.”
These were celebrated in statues and
inscriptions, of which more than 1,000
are known. Many of the names are
Germanic, but others are not, and most
scholars accept that the cult was both
Germanic and Celtic. As groups of
women, the matres and matrones bear
a resemblance to the norns, valkyries,
and dísir of the mythology that was
recorded much later.
See also Dísir; Norns
References and further reading: Everything on this subject is written in German. To my mind the most useful is Heinrich Hempel, “Matronenkult und germanische Mütterglaube,” in his Kleine
Schriften zur Vollendung seines 80. Lebensjahres am 27. August 1965, ed. Heinrich Mattias Heinrichs (Heidelberg: C. Winter, 1966), 13–37.
MEAD OF POETRY
Intoxicating beverage that makes anyone who drinks it a poet or scholar.
The mead of poetry was, like many precious things, originally fashioned by dwarfs,
224 Norse Mythology
One of the many Germanic stone carv
ings depicting one of the Matres/
Matrones. (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden)



and like many other precious things, the æsir obtained it from the giants. The
story is told most fully in the Skáldskaparmál section of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda.
As a token of the end of hostilities between them, the æsir and vanir mix
their spittle in a bowl, and out of that they make Kvasir, the wisest being. He
goes around the world dispensing wisdom but is killed by two dwarfs, Fjalar and
Galar, who mix his blood with honey and, in the kettle Ódrerir, ferment this
mixture into the mead of poetry. Then the dwarfs invite the giant Gilling and
his wife to visit. They kill Gilling by overturning their boat, and the wife by
dropping a millstone on her head. Gilling’s son Suttung comes looking for com
pensation for his parents’ deaths, and when he abandons the dwarfs on a rock on
a seat that will be covered at high tide, the dwarfs give him the mead of poetry.
Suttung puts it into the mountain Hnitbjörg, storing it in Ódrerir and two other
vessels, Bodn and Són, under the care of his daughter Gunnlöd.
Odin sets off to Giantland calling himself Bölverk (Evil-deed). He comes
upon the nine slaves of the giant Baugi, Suttung’s brother, and tosses a whet
stone in the air. As the slaves rush to catch the whetstone, the scythes they are
carrying swing about, and they are all killed. Odin then takes service with Baugi
and agrees to do the work of the nine slaves for one drink of the mead of poetry.
When the wages are due they apply to Suttung, but he refuses to pay. Odin pro
duces a drill called Rati (“Traveler” or “Madman”) and has Baugi drill a hole into
Hnitbjörg. I now let Snorri take up the story:
Then Baugi said that he had bored into the mountain, but Bölverk blew into the
borehole, and shavings flew back at him. And so he found out that Baugi wished
to deceive him, and he had him bore into the mountain. Baugi drilled some
more, and when Bölverk blew into the hole a second time, the shavings flew in.
Then Bölverk changed himself into a snake and crawled into the borehole, and
Baugi struck at him with the drill but missed. Bölverk went to where Gunnlöd
was and slept with her for three nights, and she granted him three drinks of the
mead. In the first he drank everything in Ódrerir, in the second everything in
Bodn, in the third everything in Són, and so he had all the mead. Then he
changed himself into an eagle and flew off as quickly as he could, but when Sut
tung saw the eagle flying, he changed himself into an eagle and flew after him.
But when the æsir saw where Odin was flying, they put their barrel out front,
and when Odin came over Ásgard, he spat up the mead into the barrel. But Sut
tung was so close to catching him that he sent some mead out the back, and this
was not saved. Everyone who wished had some of that, and it is called the bad
poets’ share. But Odin gave the mead to the æsir and to those humans who
could compose verse.
Hávamál, stanzas 13–14, may refer to this myth:
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 225



13. The heron of obliviousness it is called, which hovers over beers,
It steals the mind of people;
In this bird’s feathers I was fettered
At Gunnlöd’s place.
14. I was drunk, I was overdrunk
Visiting wise Fjalar;
That beer is best which restores
For each man his mind.
Although these stanzas are among others that warn about excessive drink
ing, they appear to allude to some version of the story in which Odin visited
Fjalar. If there was such a version, it has left no other trace.
Hávamál refers explicitly to Odin’s acquisition of the mead of poetry in
stanzas 104–110. Odin says that he visited Suttung (104) and got a drink of the
mead from Gunnlöd (105).
106. The mouth of the drill I had make room for me
And bore through the rock;
Over and under me stood the paths of the giants;
Thus I risked my head.
Ódrerir has “come up” to the world of men (107), but Odin would not have
been successful if he had not used Gunnlöd (108). The next stanza has an inci
dent lacking in Snorri’s version of the myth:
109. The next day the frost giants went,
To ask counsel of Hár, in the hall of Hár,
About Bölverk they asked, if he had come among the gods,
Or if Suttung had killed him.
Stanza 110 ends the section by reporting that “Odin left Suttung deceived
and made Gunnlöd weep.”
Besides the giants’ search for Bölverk in Odin’s hall, this version also differs
from Snorri’s in that Ódrerir appears to be the mead itself, rather than a vessel
in which it was kept. It also has no mention of Baugi, who is found only in
Snorri’s account. It is possible that both these differences have to do with
Snorri’s (mis)interpretations of the Hávamál stanzas. The Hávamál stanzas do
not make the shape-changing explicit, and they leave out Suttung’s pursuit of
Odin and the portion of the mead urinated out for bad poets.
The mead of poetry is one of the most valuable assets of the gods, for wis
dom tended to be encoded in verse; indeed, Snorri says in Ynglinga saga that
226 Norse Mythology



Odin spoke only in verse. The magic songs that he obtains in Hávamál are also
clearly relevant to the mead that makes one a master of poetry.
See also Baugi; Gunnlöd; Suttung References and further reading: Georges Dumézil was interested in the mead of poetry in its Indo-European context from the time of one of his very first publications in the 1920s. In chapter 1 of his Gods of the Ancient Northmen, ed. Einar Haugen, Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology, 3 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973), Dumézil integrates the story into the larger issue of the incorporation of the æsir and vanir into a single group. Snorri’s version of the story is explored by Roberta Frank, “Snorri and the Mead of Poetry,” Speculum Norroenum: Norse Studies in Memory of Gabriel Turville-Petre, ed. Ursula Dronke, Guƒrún P.

MEILI
Brother of Thor and therefore presumably son of Odin.
The name is found in the twice-attested Thor kenning, “Meili’s brother.” Since
Thor is Odin’s son, Meili must also be Odin’s son.
MERSEBURG CHARMS
Two Old High German charms with analogs in Scandinavian mythology.
The First Merseburg Charm is for getting out of bonds, and it refers to women
called Idisi who freed warriors from fetters. These women would seem to be cog
nate with the dísir of Scandinavian mythology.
The Second Merseburg Charm is for an injury:
Phol and Wodan went to the forest.
Then Balder’s horse sprained its foot.
Then Sinthgunt sang charms, and Sunna her sister;
Then Friia sang charms, and Volla her sister;
Then Wodan sang charms, as he well could:
be it bone-sprain, be it blood-sprain, be it limb-sprain:
bone to bone, blood to blood,
limb to limb, so be they glued together.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 227



Phol may be identical with Fulla in Scandinavian, and Wodan is certainly
Odin. Most observers accept that Balder is identical with Baldr, although some
think that Balder here may be a noun meaning “lord.” Clearly there is no narra
tive connection with the Scandinavian materials, where Baldr, horses, and
sprains have no particular association. However, Karl Hauck has argued in a
series of works that some bracteates show a related scene containing Baldr, Odin
(understood as a healing god), and a horse.
See also Baldr; Bracteates; Dísir References and further reading: A mainline general treatment of the gods of the Merseburg Charms is Felix Genzmer, “Die Götter des zweiten Merseburger Zauberspruches,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 63 (1948): 55–72, who sees Phol as a male counterpart to Fulla. Another interesting study is that of Axel Olrik, “Odins ridt,” Danske studier 22 (1925): 1–18. The most important of the many articles discussing the relationship of Baldr and the Second Merseburg Charm is Franz Rolf Schröder, “Balder und der zweite Merseburger Spruch,” Germanisch-Romanische Monatsschrift 34 (1953): 161–183.

MIDGARD (CENTRAL-ENCLOSURE)
The home of humans.
Völuspá, stanza 4, refers to the sons of Bur as “the ones who fashioned Midgard.”
Grímnismál, stanza 41, is more explicit, since it ties the creation of Midgard to
the parturition of Ymir’s body and makes clear the benefit to humans:
41. And from his brows the blithe gods made
Midgard for the sons of men;
And from his brain the tough-minded clouds
Were all formed.
In Hárbardsljód, stanza 23, Thor makes explicit his role in keeping Midgard
safe for humans:
I was to the east and I killed giants,
Evil maidens who were going to the mountain;
Great would be the race of giants, if they all lived;
Few humans would live under Midgard.
228 Norse Mythology



“Under Midgard,” an expression that is found elsewhere in eddic poetry,
suggests that Midgard was something protective, or rather, that it was not so
much the space enclosed for humans as the enclosure or wall itself. This agrees
with Snorri Sturluson’s description, in the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, of
the way the æsir made the earth:
It [the earth] is disk shaped, and around the outside is the deep sea, and along
the edge of the sea they gave lands to the giants to settle, and inside on the earth
they made a stronghold around the earth on account of the enmity of the giants,
and for this wall they used Ymir’s eyebrows, and they called the stronghold
Midgard.
Although Midgard was made “for the sons of men,” most of the manuscripts
of Snorri’s Edda agree that when Thor set off to visit Hymir, he left from
Midgard, not Ásgard. Perhaps this shows the special connection between Thor
and humans.
Unlike nearly all the mythological places, Midgard has cognates in other
Germanic languages and must have been a common conception.

References and further reading: In the second chapter of Den dubbla scenen: Muntlig diktning från Eddan till Abba (Stockholm: Prisma, 1978), Lars
Lönnroth has an interesting reading of the hypothetical performance situation of the opening stanzas of Völuspá, in which the building of Midgard might be paralleled by the building of the home of a chieftain in Iceland.
MIDGARD SERPENT
Mighty beast sunk in the sea encircling the
earth, a son of Loki, and Thor’s greatest
opponent.
The Midgard serpent, also known as Jör
mungand (Mighty-snake), was one of the
three in the monstrous brood sired by
Loki on Angrboda. When Odin saw the
danger the three posed, he had them
fetched, and he dispatched the serpent
into the sea, Hel into the underground
realm of the dead, and the wolf Fenrir to a
cave after he had been bound (not without
some inconvenience, especially for Ty ́r). We have this story from the Gylfagin
ning section of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda, where he says this about the serpent:
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 229
Brooch found in Öland, Sweden, depicting a
beast reminiscent of the Midgard serpent.
(Werner Forman/Art Resource)



And when they came to him, he threw the
serpent into the deep sea that lies around all
lands, and that serpent grew so much, that he
lies in the middle of the ocean around all
lands and bites his tail.
Here a word on medieval cosmology may be
in order. The world was a flat disk, with the earth
in the center and the sea all around. Thus the ser
pent is about as far away from the center, where
men and gods lived, as Hel might be under the
earth in the world of the dead, inaccessible to the
living. The fact that he bites his tail means that
he forms a complete circle around men and gods.
The Midgard serpent was especially the
enemy of Thor (just as Fenrir was of Odin, and
Hel, we might say, was of Baldr). Völuspá and
Snorri agree that they were to meet at Ragnarök.
But they also had a famous meeting during the
mythic present, when Thor fished up the Midgard
serpent out of the sea and threw his hammer at
the beast.
The myth turns up in the poetry of the some
of the earliest skalds. In addition, it was popular
as a subject on carvings in the late Viking Age.

MÍMIR (MÍM, MÍMI)
Enigmatic god associated with wisdom, Odin, and
the well at the center of the cosmos.
In eddic poetry Mímir turns up only in the expres
sions “Mímir’s head” and “Mímir’s well.” There is a myth behind the first
expression, told in the early chapters of Snorri Sturluson’s Ynglinga saga and
therefore meant to be understood as history. At the end of the Æsir-Vanir War,
according to chapter 4, the æsir sent Mímir, along with Hœnir, to the vanir as
part of the exchange of hostages (men exchanged as a pledge of good faith). Hœnir
appeared to have the qualities of a chieftain, and the vanir immediately
employed him in that capacity. But Hœnir relied exclusively on the counsels of
Mímir, and when Mímir was not present, Hœnir responded to queries by saying:
230 Norse Mythology
Thor stands in a boat with a raised
hammer near the bottom of an
eleventh-century rune stone from
Altuna. From his left hand dangles
the ox-head bait while the serpent
coils below. (National Museum of
Denmark)



“Let others decide.” The vanir therefore deduced that they had been cheated.
They beheaded Mímir and sent the head to Odin, who preserved it and listened
to the hidden things it had to say to him. Thus in Völuspá, stanza 46, as the seer
ess describes the onset of Ragnarök, she has these things to say:
Mím’s sons sport, and the world tree trembles
At the old Gjallarhorn.
Loudly blows Heimdall, the horn is aloft,
Odin is speaking to Mím’s head.
Note first that the form of the name here is Mím, not Mímir. This suggests
that more than one figure may have been conflated to make the Mímir we have
in the mythology. Mím’s sons would presumably be the æsir (from whom Mím
was sent in the mythic near past to the vanir, as I have just said).
Mím’s head, to use the form that the eddic poets did, is also found in Sigr
drífumál, stanza 14.
Then Mím’s head spoke
Wisely the first word,
And told true staves.
This is followed by a list of runes that may be carved, and such a list also
precedes the stanza. Odin is of course connected with the origin of runes, as he
is more generally with the wisdom that may be derived from Mím’s head.
The form Mímir is associated with the well. Here is what Snorri Sturluson
says in the Gylfaginning section of his Edda. He is talking about the world tree,
Yggdrasil.
Under that root, which turns toward the frost giants, is Mímisbrunn [the well
of Mímir], in which wisdom and human knowledge are hidden, and that one is
called Mímir, who owns the well. He is full of wisdom, because he drinks from
the well using the horn Gjallarhorn.
The seeress of Völuspá mentioned this well in connection with Odin’s wisdom:
I know fully, Odin, where you hid your eye:
In the famous well of Mímir.
Mímir drinks mead each day
From the pledge of Valfödr [Odin].
The passage is usually understood to mean that Odin gave away one of his
eyes to gain mystic vision, and that he did so by putting the eye in Mímir’s well.
The Völuspá poet apparently imagined that the eye could be used as a kind of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 231



drinking vessel, unless what the stanza means is that the whole well could be
called “pledge of Odin.” That mead can be drunk from it is not surprising, since
mead confers wisdom.
The location of Mímir’s well beneath the root that runs toward the frost giants
suggests a connection, perhaps primal, between Mímir and the giants, even though
we know that Mímir was a member of the æsir in the mythic near past. Here again
we may be dealing with a conflation of figures and conceptions. But the location
near Yggdrasil also may help illuminate the tree called Mímameid (Mími’s-tree),
which is found twice in the poem editors call Fjölsvinnsmál. Mímameid could be
a name for Yggdrasil; if so, Hoddmímir’s forest might also have to do with the tree.
Etymologically, Mímir is associated with our word “memory,” and this pro
vides attractive possibilities for interpretation. Memory is something valued and
especially understood by Odin, but misunderstood and undervalued by the vanir.
It stands at the very center of the Odinic universe.
See also Gjallarhorn; Hoddmímir’s Forest References and further reading: A. LeRoy Andrews, “Old Norse Notes 7: Some Observations on Mímir,” Modern Language Notes 43 (1928): 166–171, offered a satisfyingly romantic interpretation, making Mímir’s head a drinking skull (there is, sad to report, no evidence of drinking from skulls). On Mímir and memory, see Margaret Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Icelandic Society, vol. 1: The Myths (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), 213–215.
MÓDGUD (BATTLE-WEARY)
Maiden who guards the Gjallarbrú; encountered by Hermód on his journey to Hel
attempting to retrieve Baldr.
Módgud is found only in Snorri, who states explicitly that she guards the bridge.
In the narrative, she asks Hermód his name and family and informs him that five
troops of dead men rode over the bridge yesterday.
And yet my bridge resounds no less under you alone, and you do not have the
countenance of dead men. Why do you ride the road to Hel?
Hermód asks whether Baldr has come that way. Módgud replies that he has
and adds that the way to Hel lies down and north.
Módgud fills to some extent the epic role of one who challenges the hero
upon arrival, often near a body of water, but she also functions as a donor figure
here by giving Hermód the information he needs. She thus seems to have more
a narrative than a mythic or religious function.
See also Baldr; Gjallarbrú; Hermód
232 Norse Mythology



MÓDI (ANGRY-ONE)
Son of Thor.
Hymiskvida, stanza 34, uses the kennings “father of Módi” and “husband of Sif”
for Thor, and in Skáldskaparmál Snorri agrees that “father of Módi” is a Thor
kenning.
Unlike Magni, Thor’s other son, Módi has no particular role in the mytho
logical present. With Magni, however, and with Odin’s sons Vídar and Váli and
the victim Baldr and his killer Höd, Módi will survive Ragnarök. In the after
math he will inherit Mjöllnir along with his brother, as Vafthrúdnismál, stanza
55, states, and as Snorri reports in Gylfaginning when he quotes the stanza.
Of the six second-generation gods who are to survive Ragnarök, Módi has
the thinnest dossier. But his name turns up frequently enough as the base word
in man kennings that he must have been fairly well-known.
See also Magni; Ragnarök; Váli, Son of Odin; Vídar
MUNDILFŒRI
Father of the sun and moon.
The main evidence for this figure is Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 23. In stanza 22,
Odin asks the wise giant Vafthrúdnir whence the moon and sun came to travel
over people. The giant responds in stanza 23:
Mundilfœri he is called, the father of Máni
And also of Sól the same;
Into heaven shall they turn each day,
So that people can reckon years.
Snorri concocts a somewhat different story: Mundilfœri is a man who had
two children who were so beautiful that he named them Máni and Sól (i.e.,
Moon and Sun), and the gods punished this act of pride by placing the children
in heaven to serve the actual heavenly bodies, which the gods had created. Sól
drives the horses that pull the sun, and Máni controls the motion of the moon
and its waxings and wanings.
Various explanations have been offered for the name (which varies in sig
nificant ways in the sources). If the first component, mundil-, is associated with
mund, “period of time,” then the name might be a kind of kenning for moon,
something like “he who causes periods of time to move.”

Deities, Themes, and Concepts 233



MUSPELL
Probably a giant; being associated with Ragnarök and the origin of the cosmos.
In eddic poetry Muspell is associated with groups, Muspell’s peoples (Völuspá,
stanza 51), and Muspell’s sons (Lokasenna, stanza 42). Both refer to the hordes
of evil beings that will invade the world at Ragnarök to fight with the gods.
Snorri Sturluson, in the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, made copious refer
ence to the sons of Muspell at Ragnarök, but he also referred to Muspell in con
nection with the origin of the cosmos.
That part of Ginnunga gap, which faced the north, was filled with a load and
heaviness of ice, and in from there drizzle and a gust of wind; and the southern
part of Ginnunga gap turned toward those sparks and embers, which flew out
of Muspellsheim. . . . Just as cold and all bad things came from Niflheim, all
that which came from Muspell was hot and bright, but Ginnunga gap was as
calm as a windless sky, and when the warm breeze met the frost, it melted and
dripped. And from those drops of poison life emerged, with the power that the
heat sent, and it grew into a human form, and that one is called Ymir, but the
frost giants call him Aurgelmir, and all the families of frost giants descend
from him.
Although it has been argued that this passage suggests that Muspell is a
place, the notion seems hardly credible. Rather, it seems that Muspell presides
over a fiery region outside the realm of the gods, and from there some chaos
beings will come when Ragnarök is at hand; after all, the world is to be con
sumed by flames.
There are fascinating cognates in other Germanic languages. Old High Ger
man has a poem that modern editors call Muspilli because that word is to be
found in it as a word for the subject of the poem, the Christian Last Judgment.
In the Old Saxon Heliand, an epic about Christ, the form mudspell is to be
found, with the same meaning. Taking into account the medieval Icelandic
materials as well, scholars are inclined to understand the word as referring to the
fiery end of the earth. The figure in Scandinavian mythology would be a person
ification of that notion.
See also Ginnunga gap References and further reading: Most of the work on Muspell-Muspilli-Mudspell is in German. The most recent book, that of Heinz Finger, Untersuchungen zum “Muspilli,” Göppinger Arbeiten zur Germanistik, 244 (Göttingen: Kummerle, 1977), doubts the close parallel between the German and Scandinavian conceptions.
234 Norse Mythology



NAGLFAR
Ship that will transport the forces of chaos at Ragnarök.
Völuspá, stanza 50, has a list of bad things that will happen at Ragnarök, ending
with “Naglfar casts off.”
In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri Sturluson has more infor
mation. At Ragnarök:
It will also happen that that ship Naglfar will get loose. It is made of the nails
of dead men, and for that reason it is worth warning that if men die with uncut
nails they greatly increase the materials for Naglfar, which the gods and men
would least wish them to do.
Earlier Snorri had said that “Naglfar is the largest ship; Muspell owns it.”
The information about uncut nails is not found outside of Snorri. Naglfar
looks as though it should mean “Nail-farer,” but other etymologies have been
proposed. Of these I find most attractive the idea that “nail” is a metonym for a
ship, whose planks were fastened with nails.
See also Muspell
References and further reading: Nails to hold planks together are the centerpiece of the interpretation of Hallvard Lie, “Naglfar og Naglfari,” Maal og minne, 1954: 152–161.
NAGLFARI
First husband of Nótt (Night).
We have this information only from Snorri Sturluson, who describes Nótt’s mar
riages in the Gylfaginning section of his Edda. In this first, and otherwise
unknown, marriage, a child named Aud (Wealth) was produced. No further men
tion is to be found.
NÁL (NEEDLE)
Mother of Loki, apparently a secondary name of Laufey.
Only the late Sörla tháttr states explicitly that Nál and Laufey are the same person:
There was a man called Fárbauti. He was an old man and was married to that
woman who was named Laufey. She was both slender and weak, and for that
reason she was called Nál [Needle].
Nál is unknown in skaldic and eddic poetry.

Deities, Themes, and Concepts 235



NANNA
Wife of Baldr, burned on the funeral pyre with him.
No vernacular source has very much to say of Nanna. Snorri is the most inform
ative. In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, he does not mention Nanna when
he presents Baldr. When he comes to Forseti, he says that Forseti is the son of
Baldr and Nanna Nepsdóttir (Nep is otherwise wholly unknown). In the descrip
tion of Baldr’s funeral Snorri refers to her again as Nanna Nepsdóttir and says
that when she, Baldr’s wife, saw his body on the pyre, she “burst from grief” and
was placed there alongside him. She accompanied him to Hel and sent back with
Hermód some linen cloth for Frigg and a finger ring for Fulla, just as Baldr
returned the ring Draupnir to Odin.
In the Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus, Nanna is a human woman,
the pivot of a love triangle involving the demigod Balderus and the human king
Høtherus. Høtherus gets the girl, and Balderus dies, still presumably loving her,
killed by Høtherus.
Völuspá, stanza 30, refers to valkyries as “Nannas of Odin.” I have used a
capital letter, as though it were a name, but it is also possible that there was a
common noun, nanna, which would have meant something like “woman.”
There is an account of a Rus (probably Swedish) Viking Age funeral in the writ
ings of an Arab traveler, Ibn Fadlan, in which a slave girl is sacrificed at the
funeral of her master, just as Nanna dies at Baldr’s funeral and is burned beside
him. Was Nanna a nanna? It seems unlikely, but considering the possibility will
give some idea of the interpretive difficulties offered by Scandinavian mythology.
See also Baldr; Forseti; Höd References and further readings: I consider in excruciating detail all the relevant Nanna details and spin a very speculative hypothesis about Nanna and nanna in chapter 3 of my Murder and Vengeance among the Gods: Baldr in Scandinavian Mythology, FF Communications, 262 (Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica: 1997).
NARI AND/OR NARFI
Son(s) of Loki.
In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri introduces Loki as one “also
numbered among the æsir.” At the end of this introduction, Snorri tells about
the vengeance taken on Loki for his role in the death of Baldr. First the gods cap
ture Loki:
Then three stone slabs were taken and stood on edge and holes cut in each.
Then Loki’s sons, Váli and Nari or Narfi, were seized. The æsir turned Váli into
the form of a wolf, and he tore apart Narfi, his brother. Then the æsir took his
236 Norse Mythology



guts and bound Loki with them across the three sharpened stones; one is under
his shoulders, the second under his loins, and the third under the hollows
behind his knees, and these bonds turned to iron.
The same vengeance is described in the prose colophon to Lokasenna, there
of course motivated by Loki’s insulting of all the gods. Again Loki tries to hide
but is taken. “He was bound with the guts of his son Nari. But Narfi, his son,
turned into a wolf.” Narfi’s metamorphosis is not explained.
There is thus considerable confusion here. Nari may also be Váli (otherwise
the name of a son of Odin), and Nari may or may not be the same as Narfi. To
make matters worse, there is another Narfi or Nörfi, the father of Nótt (Night),
whose name turns up as Nör in the eddic poems.
See also Nótt; Váli, Son of Loki
NERTHUS
Goddess of the Germans, described by the Roman historian Tacitus toward the end
of the first century C.E.
Tacitus has mentioned a whole set of tribes:
There is nothing noteworthy about them individually, except that in common
they worship Nerthus, that is, Mother Earth, and they believe her to intervene
in the affairs of humans and to ride among people. There is on an island of the
ocean a sacred grove, and in it a consecrated cart, covered with cloth. A single
priest is allowed to touch it. He perceives the entry of the goddess into the
shrine and follows with veneration as she is led away drawn by cows. Then a
period of rejoicing, places of festival, as many as are honored to receive and
entertain her. They do not enter into war; they do not take up arms. Every
weapon is hidden. Peace and quiet are then alone known, and then alone loved,
until the same priest returns the goddess, when she has had her fill of human
conversation, to her temple. Thereafter the cart, the cloth, and, if you wish to
believe it, the deity herself, are washed in a secret lake. Slaves serve her, whom
the same lake swallows. Hence there is a secret terror and a holy ignorance
about what that may be, which they only see to die.
Both Frey and Freyja are associated with carts, and Njörd is especially asso
ciated with water. Indeed, “Nerthus” is the feminine form of what the name
“Njörd” would have looked like during the time Tacitus wrote. The identifica
tion with Mother Earth probably has much less to do with Jörd in Scandinavian
mythology than with fertility goddesses in many cultures. In short, Nerthus
looks very much like one of the vanir, although her cult is attested more than a
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 237



millennium before the Scandinavian sources were recorded, and Tacitus’s de
scription of her cult may tell us something about the later cult of the vanir.
See also Frey; Freyja; Vanir References and further reading: The etymological relationship between Njörd and Nerthus, as well as the similar relationship between Frey and Freyja, is best set forth by Axel Kock, “Die Göttin Nerthus und der Gott Niorpr,” Zeitschrift für deutsche Philologie 28 (1896): 289–294. In “The Votaries of Nerthus,” Namn och bygd 22 (1934), 26–51, Kemp Malone surveyed the evidence about the tribes who worshipped Nerthus and located the cult somewhere near the Limfjord, in Jutland, Denmark. Eric Elgquist, Studier rörande Njordkultens spriding bland de nordiska folken (Lund: Olin, 1952), used place-name evidence to discuss the dissemination of the Njörd cult among the Nordic peoples, which he thinks originated in southern Jutland. Edgar Polomé, “À propos de la déesse Nerthus,” Latomus 13 (1954): 167–200, sees the Nerthus cult as associated with the fertility of the soil, and he thinks agriculture was primarily a female activity at the time that Tacitus was writing.
NIDAFJÖLL
Mountains in the underworld.
Stanza 66, the last stanza of Völuspá, says the dragon Nídhögg, carrying corpses,
will come flying down from the Nidafjöll. This conception of the place is clearly
a negative one, but in Gylfaginning Snorri says that at Ragnarök the hall Sin
dri—a good hall, made of gold, in which good and righteous people shall dwell
will stand upon the Nidafjöll. Snorri’s source here was Völuspá, stanza 37, which
locates the hall of the family of Sindri on Nidavellir, that is, on plains, not
mountains. Why he would make this change is unclear.
The second component of Nidafjöll, fjöll, just means “mountains” (compare
the English “fell”). The first part, however, could be one of at least two things:
the darkness of the waning moon or a dwarf name (Nidi).
See also Nidavellir; Nídhögg; Sindri
NIDAVELLIR
Plains, perhaps in the underworld, site of a splendid hall.
We find the Nidavellir only in Völuspá, stanza 37:
There stood to the north, on the Nidavellir,
A hall of gold, of the family of Sindri.
Snorri conflated these plains with the mountains called Nidafjöll and said
that it was there the hall Sindri was located. Presumably plains and mountains
238 Norse Mythology



are related. The first part of each name could be the darkness of the waning
moon or a dwarf name (Nidi).
See also Nidafjöll; Sindri
NÍDHÖGG (EVIL-BLOW)
Dragon associated with Yggdrasil, the world tree.
Grímnismál mentions Nídhögg in two stanzas:
32. Ratatosk is the name of a squirrel who shall run
on the ash of Yggdrasil;
words of an eagle he shall carry down
and say to Nídhögg below.
and
35. The ash of Yggdrasil suffers difficulty,
more than men may know;
a hart bites from below, yet on the side it rots;
Nídhögg harms it from below.
Snorri adds that the words transported down by the squirrel are hostile and
that he carries them in both directions, and that Nídhögg is a snake or dragon,
one of many who live below one of the roots of Yggdrasil.
Völuspá gives Nídhögg a role at Ragnarök. As the world dissolves into
chaos, as the seeress sees murderers, oath breakers, and adulterers wading
through heavy currents, “There Nídhögg sucked / the corpses of the departed, /
the wolf tore men apart.” But more important is Nídhögg’s appearance in stanza
66, the very last one in the poem:
There the dark dragon comes flying,
The gleaming snake, down from the Nidafjöll;
In his feathers he carries—he flies over the field
Does Nídhögg, corpses—now she must sink down.
This stanza follows the seeress’s discussion of the reemergence of the earth
and the æsir, and it is not difficult to imagine a performance of Völuspá in which
this last stanza, with the dragon zooming overhead, would suggest the advent of
Ragnarök and thus would be a particularly effective way to end the performance,
a real surprise ending. But whether or not one takes an interest in this surmise
about oral performance, it is clear that Nídhögg was an important symbol of
chaos and the looming end of the world.

Deities, Themes, and Concepts 239



NIFLHEIM (FOG-WORLD) AND NIFLHEL (FOG-HEL)
World of the dead.
If we are to distinguish between the two, we would say that Niflheim is the
ancient underworld, where Hel has her domain, and Niflhel is the ninth under
world of the dead.
Niflheim is unknown in poetry but is mentioned several times by Snorri
Sturluson in the Gylfaginning section of his Edda. It is ancient because it some
how existed before the world was created.
It was many ages before the earth was created, that Niflheim was made, and in
the middle of it is the spring Hvergelmir, and from it flow those rivers that are
so named: Svöl (Cool), Gunnthrá (Battle-pain), Fjörm (Rushing), Fimbulthul
(Mighty-wind or Mighty-speaker), Slíd (Dangerous) and Hríd (Storm), Sylg
(Slurp) and Ylg (She-wolf), Víd (Wide), Leipt (Flash).
In discussing Ginnunga gap, Snorri contrasts all the cold and bad things in
Niflheim with the heat of Muspell, but he does not elaborate further. However,
he does place Niflheim centrally in his discussion of the world tree:
The ash is the greatest and best of all trees. Its limbs stretch over the entire
world and rise above heaven. Three roots of the tree hold it up and stretch out
widely. One is among the æsir, the second among the frost giants, where Gin
nunga gap used to be, the third stands over Niflheim. Under that root is
Hvergelmir, and Nídhögg gnaws the roots from below.
Thus Snorri gives Niflheim both a cosmogonic and cosmological function.
It also has a role in the mythic present as the abode of the dead. This Snorri
explains when he discusses the three monstrous children of Loki, each of whom
is banished by the æsir: Odin casts the Midgard serpent into the sea, and the æsir
bind the wolf Fenrir. As for Hel,
Hel he [Odin] threw into Niflheim and gave her power over nine worlds, that
she should host all those who were sent to her, and they are those who die of
illness or old age. She has a large residence there, and the walls are extremely
high and the gate huge. Éljudnir [Rain-damp] is the name of her hall, hunger her
plate, starving her knife, Ganglati her serving boy, Ganglöt her serving woman,
stumbling block the threshold that leads in, Kör [Sickbed] her bed, Blíkjanda-böl
[Pale-misfortune] her bedhangings. She is half dark blue and half flesh color. For
this reason she is easily recognized and rather stooping but fierce.
Unlike Niflheim, Niflhel is found in eddic poetry. In Vafthrúdnismál,
stanza 43, Odin tells the giant Vafthrúdnir how he has come to be so wise:
240 Norse Mythology



About the runes of the giants and of all the gods
I can tell the truth
Because I have come through each world.
From nine worlds I came below Niflhel;
Thither men die out of Hel.
This stanza seems to say that Niflhel is some lower version of Hel, into
which some people go when they die. That complexity appears to be missing in
the other reference to Niflhel in eddic poetry, namely, stanza 2 of Baldrs drau
mar, which says that Odin traveled “down into Niflhel” when he went to
explore the implications of Baldr’s bad dreams.
In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri mentions Niflhel, and he
appears to be paraphrasing and expanding the stanza from Vafthrúdnismál. Well
behaved persons, he says, will be with Alfödr, “but evil men will go to Hel and
thence to Niflhel; that is down in the ninth world.”
The confusion between Niflheim and Niflhel is neatly summed up by vari
ation in the manuscripts of Snorri’s Edda. In describing the fate of the giant mas
ter builder of the wall around Ásgard, two of the four main manuscripts say that
Thor bashed the giant’s head and sent him to Niflheim, and the other two say
that Thor sent him to Niflhel.
See also Ginnunga gap; Hel
NJÖRD
God, member of the vanir group.
According to Snorri’s Gylfaginning Njörd lives in heaven at Nóatún (Boathouse);
he rules the motion of the wind and stills the sea and fire; he should be called on
for seafaring and fishing. He is so wealthy that he can endow land and money
and should be called on for that purpose. He came to the æsir in exchange for
Hœnir as a settlement established between the æsir and vanir. He is married to
Skadi but the marriage failed, since he prefers to live by the sea and she in the
mountains. Although Snorri cites two stanzas about this marriage, the poem
from which they are taken is lost, and Njörd does very little in mythic narrative.
His role in taking Skadi to wife was anything but active, and otherwise he is
known, other than as the father of Frey and Freyja, only as a hostage, from the
vanir to the æsir and also apparently to the giants (Lokasenna, stanza 34).
The story of the arrangement of Njörd’s marriage to Skadi is told in
Haustlöng and Skáldskaparmál, and Njörd plays a very passive role. The entire
mythic complex involves travel by Odin, Loki, and Hœnir, the disruption of
their food supply by Thjazi, the capture of Loki when the staff he uses to strike
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 241



Thjazi in eagle form sticks to the giant, and the subsequent removal of Idun and
her golden apples to Thjazi. Loki is forced to undertake the rescue of Idun and
does so in bird form. According to Skáldskaparmál, he changes Idun into a nut
and flies off with her in his claws, and Thjazi, again in the form of an eagle, flies
in pursuit. After Loki’s arrival with Idun, the gods light a fire that singes Thjazi’s
feathers and causes him to crash inside the gate of Valhöll, where the gods kill
him. Here the much shortened account in Haustlöng ends.
Skáldskaparmál continues with the aftermath. Thjazi’s daughter Skadi puts
on armor and sets off to demand compensation. In Ásgard she agrees to accept a
husband from among the gods as compensation, and the gods offer her a choice
based on the lower legs alone (Old Icelandic fótr, the term used, actually denoted
the foot or the foot and leg). Seeing a particularly nice pair, she says, “I choose
this one; there can be little ugly about Baldr,” but she has chosen Njörd. Her
final condition is that the gods should make her laugh, and Loki succeeds in
doing so by tying a rope about his testicles and the beard of a she-goat and then,
while each brays, falling onto Skadi’s lap.
Most observers assign the story as a whole to Loki’s dossier, for he is the
only constant. The play with castration and inverted sex roles is obvious; indeed,
it runs throughout the story. Skadi puts on helm and armor and sets off in the
role ordinarily taken by a male kinsman to obtain compensation or extract
vengeance for the death of her father Thjazi, presumably as sole surviving heir.
Compensation in the form of a spouse ordinarily involves the giving of a bride,
and it appears, then, that Njörd has somehow been feminized, just as Skadi has
put on men’s clothing and taken up a task ordinarily in the male realm. An ana
logue to the choice of spouse by lower legs may be in the scene in Kormáks saga
in which Kormák first meets Steingerd, who will be the object of his desire
throughout the saga. When her ankles peep forth from under her skirts, Kormák
utters a verse indicating that he has fallen in love with her even though he does
not know her. Reading this scene against the myth of Skadi’s choice of Njörd
would accord directly with the gender inversions there. It is also worth pointing
out that the name “Skadi” is grammatically masculine.
We know nothing about Njörd outside this myth that particularly addresses
his sexuality per se; indeed, among the vanir he took to wife his sister, as was
the custom in that society, and fathered Frey and Freyja, and he offers his siring
of Frey as a counter to Loki’s accusation concerning his humiliation by giant
esses while he was a hostage. Beyond that, however, the evidence is perhaps
equivocal. The name “Njörd” can be derived etymologically from that of
Nerthus, the goddess described by Tacitus from around the end of the first cen
tury C.E. The etymological equivalence can suggest either that some time during
the first millennium the sex of the deity changed, that the deity was hermaph
242 Norse Mythology



roditic, or, perhaps most likely, that there was once a male-female pair, like Frey
and Freyja, with identical or nearly identical names.
As Snorri says, Njörd joined the æsir as a hostage (a man exchanged as a
pledge of good faith) at the end of the war between the æsir and the vanir. He
also, according to Lokasenna, stanza 34, spent time among the giants as a
hostage. His status as hostage is then doubled. It is important to recall that
hostages in Viking and medieval Scandinavia were persons exchanged as surety
for various kinds of agreements and were ordinarily not to be mistreated. How
ever, in Lokasenna, stanza 34, Loki insults Njörd by claiming that when he was
a hostage among the giants, the daughters of Hymir urinated in Njörd’s mouth.
No satisfactory explanation of this motif has been provided (few have been
attempted), but it would seem most reasonable to regard it as reflecting a com
plete loss of social status. Since it has also been suggested that bare legs or feet
would in a European medieval public context be viewed as signs of humility or
shame, it would appear that these two myths share a common feature, one that
is perhaps ultimately associated with the hierarchically low status of the vanir
within the community of the gods. However, place-names indicate worship of
Njörd (Nerthus?) in many parts of Scandinavia, sometimes paired with the god
Ull. Here it is difficult to reconcile myth and cult.

NORNS
Collective female spirits.
Poets, especially in eddic verse, speak repeatedly of the judgment (dómr) or ver
dict (kviƒr) of the norns, and this means death or a life lived out, so that death
is imminent. One of the thulur says, “Norns are called those women who shape
what must be,” and the noun related to the verb “shape” (medieval Icelandic
skapa), medieval Icelandic sköp, which means something like “fate,” is also
used with the norns.
Snorri describes the norns explicitly in Gylfaginning. He is discussing the
center of the universe, where the gods dwell, close by Yggdrasil. “A beautiful
hall stands there under the ash tree by the well, and out of that hall come three
maidens, those who are thus named: Urd, Verdandi, Skuld. These maidens shape

lives for people; we call them norns.” Here Snorri is paraphrasing a stanza in
Völuspá, stanza 18 in the Codex Regius version of the poem:
Thence come maidens,
much knowing,
three of them, out of that lake,
which stands under the tree.
They call Urd one,
the second Verdandi
—they carved on a stick
Skuld the third.
They established laws,
they chose lives
for the children of people,
fates of men.
Snorri’s version of the stanza has the maidens emerging from a hall, not a
lake, and the seemingly more plausible hall is also found in the other version of
Völuspá, in Hauksbók. These three norns, then, had a cosmic function (“estab
lished laws”) as well as the function of shaping people’s fates. Their names are
244 Norse Mythology

transparent. Urd is similar to the past tense of the verb verƒa, “to become” and
thus means something like “Became” or “Happened.” It is cognate with Old
English wyrd, “fate, destiny” and related words in Old High German and Old
Saxon. Verdandi is the present participle of verƒa, “Becoming” or “Happening.”
Skuld is derived from the modal verb skulu, which is cognate with English
“shall” and “should,” and probably then means “Is-to-be” or “Will-happen.”
Thus these three norns in their names cover the past, the present, and the future.
Of these three, only Urd seems to be known in tradition outside this passage,
most importantly in connection with a well, the Urdarbrunn (Well-of-Urd),
which is found in poetry. Skuld is also found as a valkyrie name.
Snorri goes on in this passage. “There are additional norns, who come to
each child, when it is born, to shape the life, and these are related to the gods,
but others are of the family of the elves, and the third ones are of the dwarfs.”
He quotes Fáfnismál, stanza 13, in which the dying Fáfnir tells Sigurd that the
norns are very “differently born / they have not a family together; / some are
related to the æsir, / some to the dwarfs, / some are the daughters of Dvalin.”
Fáfnir is answering a question from Sigurd that is no longer easy to understand:
“Who are those norns, / who go under duress / and choose mothers from sons?”
Snorri’s statement about the three kinds of norns seems to suggest that he
thought the norns related to the æsir came to the children of humans; perhaps
the elf norns came to elves and the dwarf norns to dwarfs. Certainly a norn came
to the dwarf Andvari, or to his ancestors, for he says in Reginsmál, stanza 2: “[A]
wicked norn / shaped us in days of old, / that I should go in the water” (the ref
erence is to his sporting in rivers in the form of a salmon). Snorri ends his dis
cussion of the norns in Gylfaginning by having Hár respond to Gylfi’s comment
that the norns give very different fates to different people. “Good norns of good
family give a good life, but those people whose destiny is not good, bad norns
cause that.”
The skald Hallfred Óttarson vandrædaskáld coined the expression “long
maintained fates of the norns” to refer to the paganism he abandoned when he
converted to Christianity. However, a runic inscription at the entrance to the
church at Borgund in Sogn, Norway, says “Thórir carved these runes on St. Olafs
day when he came by here. The norns did both good and bad. They shaped a lot
of sorrow for me.” In much more recent folklore, the porridge put out for the
spirits at childbirth is called nornegraut, “norn’s porridge.” If, then, there is a
unified concept of the norns, it is that they are responsible for fate, and that they
act especially at childbirth.

NÓTT (NIGHT)
Personification of the night.
Nótt is found in Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 25, Vafthrúdnir’s response to Odin’s
question in stanza 24, “Whence comes the day / that goes over people / or the
night with tides?”
Delling he is called, he is Dag’s [Day’s] father,
And Nótt was born to Nör.
New moon and tides the useful powers created
For people to tell time.
In Gylfaginning Snorri has an interesting expansion of the idea in this
stanza:
Nörfi or Narfi was a giant who lived in Jötunheimar. He had a daughter named
Nótt [Night]; she was swarthy and dark, as she had the lineage for. She was mar
ried to Naglfari; their son was Aud. Next she was married to Ánar; their daugh
ter was Jörd [Earth]. Last she married Delling, and he was of the lineage of the
æsir. Their son was Dag, according to his paternal heritage.
Why Nótt had so many marriages is unclear, but it does seem obvious that
in Snorri’s view the third marriage was the best, since it led to day.
Alfödr (Odin) gave horses to Nótt and Dag so that they could be pulled
across the sky in wagons. Nótt’s horse is Hrímfaxi (Frost-mane), and drippings
from his bit, according to Snorri, cause dew.
See also Dag; Hrímfaxi
ÓD
Husband of Freyja.
Ód is little mentioned in poetry. The Völuspá poet referred to Freyja as Ód’s
maid, and in a puzzling reference in the end of Hyndluljód, Freyja’s giantess
interlocutor tells Freyja, “You ran to Ód, / ever longing.” In other words, Ód’s
existence has to do with Freyja.
The same is the case in Snorri Sturluson’s Edda. In the Gylfaginning section
Ód appears first when Snorri is discussing Freyja.
She is married to Ód, and their daughter is Hnoss. . . . Ód went away on long
journeys, and Freyja weeps for him, and her tears are red gold. Freyja has many
names, and the reason for that is that she called herself by various names when
she went about among unknown peoples looking for Ód.
246 Norse Mythology



Although “Ód’s bed-friend” is a Freyja kenning in skaldic poetry, Ód’s jour
neys are not mentioned in the older poetry, and Freyja’s journeys in search of
him are completely undocumented.
Clearly the name of Ód (Óƒr) is related to that of Odin (Óƒinn); indeed, the
linguistic relationship is identical to that between Ull and Ullin. In favor of a
close relationship between the gods represented by the two names is the fact
that Odin frequently travels (although no one seems to miss him); against it is
the fact that Snorri so clearly keeps the two apart.
See also Freyja
References and further reading: The argument for associating Ód and Odin is made most forcefully by Jan de Vries, “Über das Verhältnis von Óƒr und Óƒinn,” Zeitschrift für deutsche Philologie 73 (1954), 337–353, a response to two works that sought to separate the two: Lee M. Hollander, “The Old Norse God Óƒr,” Journal of English and Germanic Philology 49 (1950): 4–8, and Ernst Philipsson, Die Genealogie der Götter in germanischer Religion,
Mythologie, und Theologie, Illinois Studies in Language and Literature, vol. 37, part 3 (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1953).
ODIN (OLD NORSE ÓƒINN)
God of poetry, wisdom, hosts, and the dead; in the received mythology head of the
pantheon.
Odin’s father was Bur, son of Búri, the form licked from the salt blocks by the
proto-cow Audhumla. Odin’s mother was Bestla, a giantess, the daughter of
Bölthorn. His very genealogy, therefore, replicates a basic operational pattern,
namely, that the gods take as wives (or make children with) the females of the
giant group.
With his brothers Vili and Vé, Odin created the cosmos out of the body of
the proto-giant Ymir, whom they killed. Here too a basic operational pattern of
the mythology is to be found: Gods kill giants, but not vice versa. This killing of
Ymir, however, was a killing within a family, if one accepts that kinship is reck
oned both through the father and mother, as it was in real life in medieval Scan
dinavia and probably in older Germanic society. For that reason, the mythology
seems to privilege kinship reckoned only through the father.
There is much kinship to be reckoned with when it comes to Odin, one of
whose alternate names is Alfödr (All-father). Odin is hardly the father of all, but
he is the father of many within the mythology. Thor is the most important of
Odin’s sons, but there is also a set of younger sons who will survive Ragnarök:
Váli and Vídar, young gods of vengeance. The most important of his roles as
father, however, is as father of Baldr, the first god to die. When Baldr dies, all the
gods are struck dumb, but it is Odin who best understands the implications.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 247



As the name Alfödr might
also suggest, Odin is head of the
pantheon, at least as it is pre
sented in the sources recorded in
the thirteenth century. Snorri
Sturluson is explicit on this
point in the Gylfaginning section
of his Edda, and the compiler of
the main manuscript of the
Poetic Edda must have had the
same idea, for he ordered the
poems about the gods and put
Odin’s poems first. We also see
him as a leader in the opening
chapter of Ynglinga saga, the
first chapter in Snorri Sturluson’s
Heimskringla, which presents
Odin as a king who leads his
people from Tyrkland to Scandinavia, where he founds a dynasty.
Odin’s most important characteristic is his wisdom. One of the most
intriguing myths of Odin tells of his acquisition of wisdom through self-sacri
fice, recounted in stanzas 138–145 of Hávamál, the so-called Rúnatal, which
leads to the Ljódatal. Stanza 138 is justly famous:
I know that I hung
on the wind-swept tree
nine entire nights,
wounded with a spear,
given to Odin,
myself to myself,
on that tree,
of which no man knows
of what roots it runs.
The “wind-swept tree” must be Yggdrasil, the world tree, and information
about its roots belongs to the kind of cosmological knowledge that is Odin’s spe
cialty. Nine is of course the most charged number in the mythology, and the
spear is Odin’s special weapon. The next stanza apparently states that Odin was
deprived of food and drink; screaming, “I took up [or learned] the runes.” In
stanza 140 Odin says he learned nine powerful songs or chants from the famous
248 Norse Mythology

son of Bölthor, the father of Bestla,
and got a drink of the precious mead,
poured from Ódrerir.
As mentioned above, Bestla was
Odin’s mother, and Bölthor her father
(elsewhere the form of the name is
Bölthorn), so the one who taught him
the nine powerful songs is his mater
nal uncle, who, like his maternal
grandfather and mother, is a member
of the race of the giants. It is worth
recalling that Odin also acquired
knowledge from Vafthrúdnir, the wis
est of giants, from the seeress who
speaks in Völuspá, and from Hel (in
Baldrs draumar). Ódrerir is either the
mead of poetry itself or, in Snorri’s
reading, the name of one of the pots
into which the mead was delivered.
Earlier in Hávamál there was an
account of Odin’s acquisition of the
mead of poetry from the giant Suttung
through the seduction or rape of his
daughter, Gunnlöd. One way to rec
oncile that version, which was
repeated by Snorri and appears to have
been ubiquitous, with this one is to
assume that Odin entered a shamanic
trance or even died on the tree and
that his spirit traveled to Giantland
and acquired the mead while the body
was left behind. Such a reading is
enhanced by stanza 145 of Hávamál,
which appears to end this account of
the self-sacrifice: “Thus Thund [Odin]
carved / for the judgments of peoples,
/ where he arose / when he came
back.” Stanza 141 brings the incident
to its logical conclusion: “Then I
started to become fertile / and to be

wise / and to grow and to thrive;
/ a word for me from a word /
sought a word, / a deed for me /
sought a deed.” All this, appar
ently, from his “taking up” the
runes.
Within the mythological
present Odin uses his wisdom to
order himself atop the hierarchy
of all creatures. In the eddic
poem Hárbardsljód he outwits
Thor and even makes it impos
sible for that god to cross a body
of water, which is part of Thor’s
everyday functioning. In Vaf
thrúdnismál he defeats the wis
est of giants in a contest of wis
dom. In Grímnismál he carries
out an ecstatic wisdom perform
ance while hung in the fire of the human king Geirröd, who falls on his sword
at the end of the poem and is therefore succeeded by his son Agnar; thus Odin
determines the succession of kings among human beings.
Odin continues to seek out wisdom in the mythological present. Vafthrúd
nismál might be regarded as an Odinic thrust in that direction, for the giant
Vafthrúdnir answers all but one of Odin’s cosmogonic and mythological poems.
But more to the point are Völuspá, in which Odin causes a seeress to arise and
recount the mythological past, present, and future, and Baldrs draumar, in
which Odin travels to the world of the dead to investigate Baldr’s bad dreams.
Odin lives at Valhöll (Carrion-hall), where the einherjar sport each day and
night. He is therefore a god of the dead, and in fact in Ynglinga saga Snorri
Sturluson says that Odin could awaken the dead to learn secret things from
them.
Etymologically, Odin’s name meant something like “leader of the pos
sessed.” In Viking and medieval Scandinavia, few could have missed the con
nection with the word óƒr, which could mean “poetry” and “frenzy.” Odin has
a great many alternate names—more than 150, all counted. He takes a different
name in virtually each of his myths and often travels in disguise, but it is also
worth remembering that he is the god of poetry, and that the most important
feature of this poetry’s style is that it has a vast number of nouns and within
semantic categories these nouns are interchangeable.

References and further reading: As the preeminent figure in Norse mythology, Odin figures in nearly every work about it. To understand Odin is to understand the mythology, and vice versa. As throughout this book, I recommend Margaret Clunies Ross’s Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Icelandic Society, vol. 1: The Myths (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), as the best first step in that direction. There have of course been countless studies that focus on Odin, but many of them have debated whether he is a latecomer to the Germanic pantheon. I do not think he is, but in any case, the date of his arrival does not help in understanding the mythology itself.
ÓDRERIR
Either a pot in which the mead of poetry was preserved or the mead itself.
Hávamál has two ambiguous references. The first is stanza 107:
The well-acquired appearance have I used well,
Little is lacking to the wise;
Because Ódrerir has now come up
To the men of the holy place of earth.
The second is stanza 140:
Nine magic songs I got from the famous son
Of Bölthor, Bestla’s father,
And I got a drink of the precious mead,
Poured from [by? to? of? for?] Ódrerir.
In the Skáldskaparmál section of his Edda, Snorri Sturluson is quite
explicit. Ódrerir is the kettle in which the dwarfs Fjalar and Galar fermented the
blood of Kvasir into the mead of poetry. There were two other barrels, Bodn and
Són. Today most scholars would accept that it was Snorri who explicitly made
Ódrerir into a kettle instead of the mead itself.

252 Norse Mythology



ÖGMUNDAR THÁTTR DYTTS OK GUNNARS HELMINGS (THE TALE OF
ÖGMUND DINT AND GUNNAR HALF)
Tale containing putative information about the cult of Frey in Uppsala.
The tale is found in manuscripts of the Saga of Olaf Tryggvason, none of them
earlier than the fourteenth century. When the tale was composed is unknown,
but few think the tale can antedate the fourteenth century.
The tale falls into two parts, one about each of the characters named in the
title (itself an invention of modern editors). The link between the tales is a cloak,
which Ögmund borrows from Gunnar and wears when he carries out a
vengeance killing at the court of King Olaf. Mistaken for the killer, Gunnar flees
the court for Sweden. There he meets the woman who has been chosen by the
pagans to serve as the wife of Frey, actually a statue with a demon in it. In a
humorous series of dialogues, she allows Gunnar to stay with her longer and
longer, each time warning him of Frey’s displeasure, which Gunnar says he will
gladly endure if he has her good wishes. Then the time arrives for the pagan cer
emonies, and Gunnar must pull Frey’s wagon. When he tires of that, he wrestles
with Frey. Things are going badly until he calls on Olaf Tryggvason, at which
point the demon abandons the statue and runs off.
Gunnar now decides to impersonate Frey. The Swedes are impressed that
their god can eat and drink, and they are especially happy that his wife is preg
nant, although they do wonder somewhat at his now wishing to be propitiated
with gold and silver, fine clothing, or other precious things. Times are good, and
the fame of Frey spreads to Norway. Olaf suspects what is going on and has Gun
nar returned to Norway. Gunnar and his wife are baptized and keep the faith
ever after.
Although the tale certainly is amusing, and despite its obvious medieval Ice
landic Christian perspective, it does accord with certain features known else
where of the worship of Frey and similar figures such as Fródi and Njörd,
namely, the pulling about in a wagon and the ascribing of good times to the
deity. But rather than being of direct source value, the presence of these features
may simply tell us what learned men surmised about Frey in medieval Iceland.
See also Frey; Fródi, Njörd References and further reading: Alexander Haggerty Krappe, “La légende de Gunnar Half (Olafs saga Tryggvasonar, Chap. 173),” Acta Philologica Scandinavica 3 (1928–1929): 226–233, thought the tale reflected actual ritual practice, in which a man played the deity, but in “Der Göttertrug im Gunnarsπáttr helmings,” Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum 71 (1934): 155–166, Helga Reuschel argued exactly the opposite, namely, that the text has no independent value for the history of religion.

RAGNARÖK (JUDGMENT-OF-THE-POWERS)
Demise of the gods and of the cosmos at the end of the mythological present.
Although most Viking Age poets and modern scholars use the form above, Snorri
Sturluson was among those who used the form “Ragnarøkkr” (Twilight-of-the
gods), which became famous as the title of the last opera, Götterdämmerung
(Twilight of the Gods), in Richard Wagner’s Ring Cycle. It will do equally well
as a designation of the end of the gods’ day on earth.
The most powerful presentation of Ragnarök is that of the Völuspá poet.
Depending on where one believes it begins, this section of the poem takes up as
much as the last 30 of the 66 stanzas of the poem in the standard editions. In my
view it has certainly begun by stanza 39:
She saw wading there through heavy currents
Men who forswore oaths and murderers,
And the one who seduces another’s beloved;
There Nídhögg sucked
the corpses of the departed,
The wolf tore men apart—would you know more?
Stanzas 40 and 41 refer to the loss of the sun and the moon. In stanzas 42–43
mysterious cocks crow the onset of the end, and in 44, which reappears verba
tim as 49 and 58, Garm howls and the wolf runs free. In 45 the bonds of kinship
break down:
Brothers will fight and kill each other,
Cousins will destroy kinship.
It is hard in the world, much whoredom,
An ax age, a sword age, shields are split,
A wind age, a wolf age, before the world falls;
No man will spare another.
Heimdall sounds the Gjallarhorn, and the world tree Yggdrasil shudders.

Vídar avenges Odin, but still Thor, the mightiest of the gods, has not taken
the field. This he does in stanza 56:
Then comes the great son of Hlódyn [Earth],

Strongly strikes the guardian of Midgard,
All men will redden the earth;
Nine paces goes the son of Fjörgyn [Earth]

created. The sun turns black, the earth
sinks into the sea, smoke and flames
lick the sky itself.
But Ragnarök has two parts, and the
second involves rebirth. The earth arises
from the sea, and a new generation of
gods inhabits it. They have reminis
cences of their forebears and some mys
terious gaming pieces that link them to
what went before. Höd and Baldr are
there, reconciled, and Hœnir too has sur
vived the conflagration, for he “chooses
lot-sticks,” that is, he performs some sort
of ritual activity. According to the
Hauksbók redaction of the poem, “the
powerful one” then comes, and this looks
like a reference to the Christian deity.
Snorri paraphrases these verses and
adds a few details, of which the most
salient is the presence of Odin’s sons
Vídar and Váli and Thor’s sons Magni
and Módi, who will possess Thor’s ham
mer Mjöllnir, in the new world that fol
lows Ragnarök. Snorri also, following
Vafthrúdnismál, says that humans will
survive into the new world, through Líf
and Lífthrasir.
Besides Völuspá and Snorri, Rag

RÁN
Goddess of the sea.
Rán is not in eddic verses, but in skaldic poetry she is encountered fairly fre
quently, in kennings having to do with the sea (e.g., “Rán’s way” for waves) and
in woman kennings where her name is the base word (e.g., “Rán of the down
covering”). The thulur list Rán among the ásynjur, but she is never seen among
them or the gods in general in the materials that were left us. Snorri reports in
Skáldskaparmál that Rán is the wife of Ægir and that they have nine daughters,
whose names have to do with the waves. More interestingly, he also says that
she has a net with which she hunts men who go to sea. The prose header to the
eddic poem Reginsmál and Völsunga saga say that Loki went to Rán and bor
rowed her net in order to capture the dwarf Andvari, who had changed himself
into a pike and was sporting in the river.
But the net was surely primarily used to drag the drowning to their deaths.
This conception, or something like it, appears to be realized in a line from one
of the most famous skaldic poems, Egil Skallagrímsson’s Sonatorrek (Loss of
Sons). According to Egils saga (which many critics believe was written by Snorri
himself), Egil composed this poem after his son Bödvar was drowned in the
nearby fjord. The saga says that Egil’s other son had previously died, and that
after the loss of Bödvar, Egil wished to die, but that his daughter Thorgerd
tricked him into taking some nourishment and then coerced him into compos
ing a memorial poem for Bödvar. In the seventh of the 25 extant stanzas, Egil
says something like this:
Much has Rán harried about me,
I am wholly bereft of beloved friends;
The sea tore the bonds of my family,
A powerful thread right out of me.
As the poem ends, Egil complains of Odin’s treatment of him but admits
that the gift of poetry is a consolation.
If the text of Sonatorrek as we have it is genuine, it would date from around
960 (Egils saga is from the first half of the thirteenth century, but the full text of
258 Norse Mythology



Sonatorrek is only retained in seventeenth-century copies of a fifteenth-century
manuscript). Verses from Fridthjófs saga, which is post-classical, play on the idea
of drowning as visiting Rán and refer to her as an ill-bred or immoral woman.
References and further reading: Carlo Alberto Mastrelli, “Sul nome della gigantessa Rán, Studi germanici, new ser. 4, 3 (1966): 253–264, discusses the etymology of the name, which is quite obscure. Certainly an etymology connecting the name with the noun rán, “theft,” would agree with some of the sentiments adduced above. Franz Rolf Schröder, “Die Göttin des Urmeeres und ihr männlicher Partner,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur (Tübingen) 82 (1960): 221–264, is centered on Nerthus and Njörd but also includes discussion of Rán and Ægir.
RATATOSK (BORE-TOOTH)
Squirrel who lives on Yggdrasil, the world tree.
Grímnismál, stanza 32, says this:
Ratatosk is the name of a squirrel who shall run
on the ash of Yggdrasil;
words of an eagle he shall carry down
and say to Nídhögg below.
According to Snorri in Gylfaginning, the words the squirrel transports are
hostile ones, and he carries them in both directions, between the eagle atop the
tree and the dragon Nídhögg below. Thus, the world tree is not only threatened
by the harts and the dragon that chew on it and by its rotting side; it also bears,
in the fauna it supports, verbal hostility. In the sagas, a person who helps stir up
or keep feuds alive by ferrying words of malice between the participants is sel
dom one of high status, which may explain the assignment of this role in the
mythology to a relatively insignificant animal.

REGNATOR OMNIUM DEUS
God who is ruler of all; found in Tacitus, Germania, chapter 39.
The expression refers to the god in the sacred grove in which the Semnones con
duct their cult, involving, according to Tacitus, a human sacrifice. The grove is
so sacred that worshippers bind themselves with a chain when they enter, and if
they fall, they must wiggle out without help. The whole superstition, as Tacitus
puts it, rests on the idea that “the tribe originated here and the god who is ruler
of all is here.”
The association with binding suggests such collective words for the gods as
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 259



bönd and höpt, but the regnator omnium deus is clearly a single god, a head god
of the Germanic pantheon around 100 C.E. (as the pantheon was understood by a
Roman historian). The Interpretatio Germanica associated Thor with Jupiter,
but the aspect of binding would appear to suggest the “war-fetters” that Odin
can put on enemy troops, and more generally the binding that is characteristic
of so-called first-function Indo-European gods (gods of sovereignty in the scheme
devised by Georges Dumézil).

RÍGSTHULA
Eddic poem describing the origin of the social classes.
The poem is found only in Codex Wormianus (AM 242 folio) of Snorri Sturlu
son’s Edda, a manuscript from the first half of the fourteenth century. A prose
header states that Heimdall went traveling, and when he came to a coastal set
tlement he called himself Ríg. The poem itself refers only to Ríg.
Ríg visits three households. In the first and third he is fed, and one assumes
that his feeding in the second household has been lost. After dining in each
household, he goes off to bed, and there he spends three nights between the man
and woman of the household. Nine months later the woman gives birth to a son,
who in turn finds a mate and has offspring.
The first household is that of Ái and Edda, which mean something like
“Great-Grandfather” and “Great-Grandmother.” They eat coarse bread and a
broth made from boiled calf. Edda’s son is Thrall, who has thick fingers, an ugly
face, and a crooked back, and he busies himself with heavy lifting. To his farm
comes Thír (Bondswoman), and they have children who manure the fields, look
after pigs and goats, and dig turf. From them come slaves.
Ríg comes next to the household of Afi and Amma (Grandfather and Grand
mother). There is a chest on the floor. Slaves could not own property, so a chest
leads one to think of a manumission ritual, in which a freed slave symbolically
climbs onto a chest. The woman is neatly dressed, and it would have been nice
to learn what food was served. In any case, after nine months Amma bears a son
Karl (Man). He tames oxen to plow with, builds barns, and in short does what a
farmer would do. He marries Snør (Daughter-in-law), and they have sons, many
of whose names indicate social status; these are difficult to translate, but some,
for example, were used of individuals in the medieval king’s court. The daugh
ters have similar names. We do not learn what these offspring do, but from them
descend the (landowning) farmers.
260 Norse Mythology



The third household is that of Fadir and Módir (Father and Mother). Mother
is sewing and wearing fashionable garments, and the food served is fine bread and
meats, washed down with wine. Módir bears the son Jarl. The noun is cognate
with English “earl.” “Jarl” was the title of the ruler of the Trondheim area (the
Hladir jarls) and in the High Middle Ages came to mean something like “duke.”
He is trained in warfare, and Ríg takes a special interest in him. Emissaries are
sent to the hall of Hersir (Chieftain) to ask for the hand in marriage of Erna (Vig
orous?). They marry and have sons, whose names are nouns like “son,” “child,”
“heir,” “kinsman,” and “related-one.” The youngest is Kon, whom Ríg trains,
especially in runes. Kon learns the speech of birds and is encouraged by an aviary
adviser to wage war, against Dan and Danp, two kings who turn up elsewhere in
legendary prehistory. Here the poem breaks off, perhaps prematurely.
Kon the young is twice called “Konr ungr,” which many observers believe
the poet meant to suggest the noun konungr, “king.” Given the poet’s lack of
inhibition elsewhere in his naming strategies, one might think that if he had
wished to call this individual King he might have done so directly, especially
since “Konr ungr” is grammatically awkward in medieval Icelandic. Still, it does
not seem implausible that the poet would have wished to proceed from the class
of warriors or nobility to the monarch.
Discussion of the poem is frustrating. One wing has sought Celtic influ
ences, since the name of the progenitor in the poem looks a bit like Old Irish
ri/rig, “king.” Dumézil saw a shifted reflection of his tripartite Indo-European
structure, with the functions being displaced downward (see chapter 1). Others
have thought that the poem must be of medieval origin, for a society that actu
ally engaged in slaveholding, it is argued, would hardly derive slaves and the rest
of the population from a single progenitor, and more important, the division into
three groups is typical of medieval social thinking, even if the three groups
would ordinarily be laborers, warriors, and priests. Thomas Hill argued for an
ultimate connection with the Old Testament story of the sons of Noah.
Although Rígsthula offers a social-foundation myth, it had little effect on
the mythology as it is understood for the purposes of this book. Snorri never
recounts any aspect of it, and there are no kennings based on it or references to
it elsewhere, with the possible exception of the reference to all the holy families
as the kin of Heimdall in Völuspá, stanza 1. Even that accords poorly with the
poem, for no holy families descend from Ríg (who is in fact only called Heimdall
in the prose header to the poem).

RIND
Mother of Váli, the avenger of Baldr, and therefore sexual partner of Odin.
Rind is listed among the thulur for ásynjur, but with no indication of a rela
tionship with Odin or Váli. However, in Gylfaginning Snorri says that Rind,
“the mother of Váli,” is enumerated among the ásynjur. Baldrs draumar,
stanza 11, states that Rind bore Váli and that “that son of Odin” will fight when
one night old, and in his catalog of the æsir in Gylfaginning Snorri says that
Váli is the son of Odin and Rind. The relationship between Odin and Rind was
apparently not a normal one: In his Sigurdurdrápa, composed around 960 if the
stanza is genuine, the Icelandic skald Kormák Ögmundarson says that Odin
used magic (seid) on Rind, presumably to beget Váli. Saxo too has the story of
Odin begetting an avenger for Baldr, and it too is unsavory. Having learned from
a seer that the Rutenian princess Rinda is to bear the avenger of Balderus, Oth
inus sets out to seduce her. Acting as a soldier, he takes up residence with her
father, wins victories, and presses his suit, but she rejects him. A second visit,
this time acting as a smith, also fails. On the third visit, Othinus acts as a
knight, but when he finally makes some progress toward his goal it is by touch
ing the girl with a rune-carved stick, which drives her mad; here is the poten
tial parallel with Kormák’s stanza. Othinus now assumes the guise of a woman
to gain entry to the girl’s chamber, but he only succeeds in his goal when Rinda
falls sick. Dr. Othinus prescribes a potion so foul that the patient must be
bound when she takes it. She is duly bound, and Othinus rapes her. The result
of the rape is Bous.
The use of seid, especially by men, was considered shameful, and Othinus’s
rape of Rinda, not least because it involved cross-dressing, was hardly the deed
of a man of honor. Saxo reports that the gods were so disgusted by Othinus’s
cross-dressing that they banished him and replaced him with Ollerus (who
would be Ull in medieval Icelandic), who took Othinus’s title and name. After
262 Norse Mythology



ten years, Bous killed Høtherus, and Othinus returned to Byzantium, where Saxo
located the euhemerized gods, and ousted Ollerus.

RÖSKVA (RIPE?)
Servant of Thor, sister of Thjálfi.
Snorri tells in Gylfaginning, at the beginning of the myth of Thor’s visit to
Útgarda-Loki, how Röskva and Thjálfi were given to Thor as a settlement after
Thjálfi had damaged the bones of one of Thor’s goats while eating it, so that the
goat could not be properly revived by the god. Röskva plays no role in the
mythology, but the gender of the pronouns Snorri used in the continuation of the
journey to Útgarda-Loki shows that Röskva was along. In Skáldskaparmál
Snorri says that “lord of Thjálfi and of Röskva” is a Thor kenning. Besides Snorri,
there is tenth-century evidence of the existence of Röskva, since the poet Eilíf
Godrúnarson referred to Thjálfi as “brother of Röskva.”

SÆHRÍMNIR
Pig cooked at Valhöll, the unending food source of the einherjar.
The key passage is stanza 18 of Grímnismál.
Andhrímnir in Eldhrímnir
Has Sæhrímnir boiled
Best of pork, yet few knew,
On what the einherjar are nourished.
In Gylfaginning Snorri explains the passage as follows: Gylfi/Gangleri won
ders how the einherjar are fed, given that there are so many of them. Hár responds:
What you say is true, a great many of them are there, but many more shall there
yet be, and yet it will seem too few, when the wolf comes calling. But never will
there be so great a crowd of men in Valhöll, that the flesh of that pig, who is
named Sæhrímnir, will run out on them. He is boiled each day and is whole
again by evening.
The names of the cook, the pot, and the eternal pork are joined by the ele
ment hrímnir, which is derived from the word for soot on a cookpot. The element
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 263



And- could refer to (or could have been understood by Snorri as referring to) the
front of the cook, who would be facing the cookpot as he worked his culinary
magic, and “Fire-sooty” would make sense for the pot, but the pig’s name is far
from clear. It certainly looks as if it means “sea-sooty,” which some modern
observers read as “sooty sea beast.” The name would, I suppose, do in a pinch for
the famous New Orleans preparation blackened redfish, but it does seem some
what out of place for the best of pork. Those troubled by this fish-beast problem
have proposed understanding the first syllable as somehow having to do with
boiling, but that makes philological fish into fowl.

SÆMING
Son of Odin or Frey and ancestor of the Hladir jarls.
Sæming is mentioned in the prologue to Snorri Sturluson’s Edda, the prologue
to his Heimskringla, and in Ynglinga saga, the first saga in Heimskringla. In all
three texts, Snorri is operating on the principle of euhemerism; that is, on the
belief that there was a historical Odin who led the æsir from Asia to Scandi
navia. In each case he appears to be building on Háleygjatal, a poem from the
end of the tenth century by the skald Eyvind Finnsson skáldaspillir.
In the prologue to his Edda Snorri says that after Odin settled in Sweden he
went north to the coast, where he established his son Sæming as the ruler of
Norway, “and the kings of Norway, the jarls and other powerful people, traced
their lineage to him, as it says in Háleygjatal.” In the prologue to Heimskringla,
however, Snorri says that according to Háleygjatal, Sæming was the son of
Yngvi-Frey. And in Ynglinga saga, he quotes a stanza of Háleygjatal (stanza 3 in
the editions) saying it is about Sæmund, although he is not mentioned in it by
name. The verse is not clear, but it seems to suggest that Odin sired someone on
Skadi (which is unknown elsewhere). Snorri explains it as follows:
Njörd got that wife, who was called Skadi. She did not wish to have intercourse
with him and was married afterward to Odin. They had many sons. One of them
was called Sæming.
SÁGA
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists her second in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the
æsir, after Frigg, and says only that she lives at the great farm Søkkvabekk
264 Norse Mythology



(Sunken-bank?). In Grímnismál, stanza 7, Odin includes Søkkvabekk as the
fourth of the residences he surveys and says that cool waves resound over it;
“there Odin and Sága / drink through all the days, / happy, out of a golden cup.”
The similarity of Søkkvabekk to Fensalir, Frigg’s dwelling; Odin’s open drinking
with Sága; and the usual etymology of the name, which relates it to the verb sjá,
“to see” and understands her as a seeress, have led most scholars to understand
Sága as another name for Frigg.
SEID
A form of magic and divination, associated in the mythology especially with Odin.
Snorri Sturluson offered a description of seid as carried by a euhemerized Odin
during Scandinavian prehistory:
Odin knew that art called seid, which the greatest power accompanied, and he
carried it out himself. Through it he could determine the fates of men and
things yet to happen, and also to arrange death or bad luck or ill health for
people, and further to take the mind or strength of people and give it to others.
And this magic art, when it is carried out, is accompanied by so much ergi [sex
ual perversion] that it did not seem shameless for men to indulge in it, and so
this art was taught to priestesses.
The connection with females is widespread. Freyja is said to be the one who
brought seid to the æsir (Ynglinga saga, chapter 4), and in Völuspá,
Gullveig/Heid (who may also be Freyja) practices it.
The sagas have many accounts of seid set in pre-Christian Iceland, again
mostly practiced by women. The most famous of these is in Eiríks saga rauda
(The Saga of Erik the Red), which is set in Greenland just before the conversion
to Christianity. Famine has overrun a certain region, and a seid-woman is asked
to prophesy its duration. She ascends a platform, songs are sung, and she makes
contact, she says, with spirits. She predicts a quick end to the famine and a pros
perous future for the woman, herself a Christian, who helped with the magic
songs. Besides this divination, other examples of seid in the sagas are like that
described for Odin, in that seid can be used to do bad things for people.
As the master of wisdom and of verse, Odin would naturally be the mytho
logical figure closest to this kind of magic, and in fact one skald says that Odin
used seid on Rind, whom he seduced or raped to beget an avenger for Baldr.
Freyja, on the other hand, never uses it.
In the scholarly discussion of seid, most of which has to do not with the
mythology but with an attempt to unravel the historical background, some
scholars point to shamanic practices, especially in northern Eurasia.

For those who can read Swedish, Dag Strömbäck, Sejd: Textstudier i nordisk religionshistoria, Nordiska texter och under
sökningar, 5 (Stockholm: H. Geber; Copenhagen: Levin & Munksgaard, 1935), offers a thorough and well-balanced study.
SIF (IN-LAW-RELATIONSHIP)
Thor’s wife, mother of Magni and Módi.
Although Sif plays only a small role in the mythology, the use of the kenning
“husband of Sif” for Thor is found in both skaldic and eddic poetry.
Sif’s major myth has to do with her golden headpiece, which was made for
her by dwarfs after Loki cut off her hair. Five other precious objects, all of them
of extreme mythological importance (e.g., Thor’s hammer), were also made at
the same time. It is easy to lose sight of the fact that the gods got all these objects
because Thor forced Loki to replace Sif’s hair.
Twice Sif appears in connection with accusations of cuckoldry made to
Thor. In Hárbardsljód, stanza 48, Odin accuses Sif of having a lover at home, but
he does not elaborate. In Lokasenna, stanza 54, Loki does elaborate. When Sif
tells Loki that she is blameless, Loki responds:
You would be alone if that were so,
Wary and fierce toward a man;
I know one, I’m pretty sure,
Who cuckolded Thor,
And that was the sly Loki.
But Loki makes this accusation about all the goddesses. Sif’s faithfulness to
Thor is difficult to judge. Nor does the meaning of her name shed any light on
that topic.
See also Dwarfs; Loki References and further reading: Margaret Clunies Ross, “∏órr’s Honour,” in Studien zum Altgermanischen: Festschrift für Heinrich Beck, ed. Heido Uecker (Berlin and New York: W. de Gruyter, 1994), 43–76, puts the making of Sif’s gold headpiece into the context of Thor’s responsibility to look after his female relations.
266 Norse Mythology



SIGYN
Wife of Loki, mother of Nari or Narfi.
We know nothing of Sigyn’s background, but she is mentioned as early as the
pre-Christian skald Thjódólf of Hvin, who in his Haustlöng called Loki the
“cargo of the arms of Sigyn.” In the mythology Sigyn’s only role is to hold a basin
over Loki’s head to catch the venom dripping from a snake under which he is
bound, punished either for his role in the death of Baldr (Gylfaginning) or his
insulting of all the gods (prose colophon to Lokasenna). Völuspá, stanza 35
appears to refer to this scene. The seeress is speaking:
She saw a prisoner lie in a grove of valleys
A malevolent figure identical to Loki;
There sits Sigyn, thought not at all
Glad about her husband—would you know more?
See also Loki; Nari and/or Narfi
SINDRI (SLAG)
A person connected with a golden hall, or the hall itself.
Völuspá, stanza 37, says that Sindri’s family owns a splendid hall:
There stood to the north, on the Nidavellir,
A hall of gold, of the family of Sindri.
Who the family of Sindri might be is a puzzle. The second half of the stanza
refers to a second hall, Brimir, that is, a beer hall of a giant, but it is unclear
whether a break or continuation is meant. The connection of the name with
forging and the gold of Sindri’s hall might suggest the dwarfs. Indeed, Nidavellir
might be the fields of the dwarf Nidi. If they are not Nidi’s fields, they are prob
ably dark fields, and this concept too would accord with the notion of Sindri as
a dwarf. And someone through whose hands the main manuscript of Snorri’s
Edda passed evidently did think Sindri was a dwarf, for he wrote “Brokk and Sin
dri” in the margin near where the story of Brokk’s smithing of the precious
objects of the gods is told. This occurred after the Middle Ages, however.
Snorri, on the other hand, wrote in Gylfaginning that Sindri was the name
of a hall that will stand upon the mountains called Nidafjöll. It will be a good
hall, made of gold, in which good and righteous people shall dwell when Rag
narök arrives.

Deities, Themes, and Concepts 267



SJÖFN
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists Sjöfn seventh in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the
æsir and says this about her: “She does much to turn the minds of people to love,
men and women. From her name love is called sjafni.” The noun sjafni is indeed
included in the thulur as a love word, but the goddess herself is otherwise
unknown. The name is used as the base word in three woman kennings. As with
many of the other minor goddesses, some scholars believe that she may just be
Frigg under another name.
SKADI
Wife of Njörd, daughter of Thjazi, and a giant by birth but still regarded as a member
of the æsir.
Skadi is mentioned as the daughter of the giant Thjazi in several sources, includ
ing Grímnismál, stanza 11, and Hyndluljód, stanza 31 (part of the “Short
Völuspá”). In each of these stanzas Thjazi is specifically identified as a giant.
Grímnismál says Skadi inhabits Thrymheim, the old homestead of her father.
The circumstances of Skadi’s marriage to Njörd, one of the foremost of the
vanir, are told only by Snorri. In Skáldskaparmál he tells how the marriage came
about in the first place. Following Thjazi’s abduction of Idun, Thjazi is killed by
the æsir during her retrieval. Apparently he has no male relative to seek com
pensation, for Skadi acts in this role.
And Skadi, the daughter of Thjazi the giant, took helmet and byrnie and all
weapons of war and went to Ásgard to avenge her father, but the æsir offered her
a settlement and compensation, and the first [part] was that she should choose
a husband for herself and choose by the lower legs and not see any more than
that. Then she saw some exceedingly attractive lower legs of a man and said, “I
choose this one; there can be little ugly about Baldr.” But it was Njörd of
Nóatún. She also had in her settlement what she thought the æsir would not be
able to accomplish, and that was to make her laugh. Then Loki tied a rope
around the beard of a she-goat and the other end around his testicles, and they
both pulled on it and each screamed loudly, and then Loki fell into Skadi’s lap;
and then she laughed. And so the conditions of the settlement with her were
met by the æsir.
Frey too is married to a giantess, Gerd, and although the other gods sire chil
dren by giantesses, these are the only two marriages of gods to giantesses. It
would therefore appear, as Margaret Clunies Ross has shown, that because of
their lower hierarchical status, the vanir cannot choose wives from among the
268 Norse Mythology



æsir and must take them from the giants. But the situation is even stranger with
Njörd, since he is not the chooser but the chosen. It would appear that the gods
tricked Skadi somehow, but our understanding of the lower-leg beauty contest
is imperfect. Baldr is a young and handsome god; Njörd is by this point in the
mythological present an old man. (A note on “lower-leg”: The word used refers
both to the foot and to the foot, ankle, and calf running up to the knee; since the
word in question, fótr, is cognate with our word “foot,” that is the translation
one often sees.)
Loki’s sport with the goat clearly plays on themes of castration, and making
a goddess laugh may have associations with ritual. However, Loki and Skadi
have a special relationship in any case. Snorri in Gylfaginning and the prose coda
to Lokasenna agree that when Loki was bound, it was Skadi who hung over his
face the poisonous snake whose venom Sigyn catches in a pot. When Sigyn is out
emptying the pot, the venom drips on him and causes his tectonic writhings.
And in Lokasenna, stanzas 49–52, Loki and Skadi engage in an angry exchange
in which Loki boasts not only that he has seduced her (he says this of all the god
desses) but also that he took the lead when her father was killed.
The marriage between Skadi and Njörd is a failure. In Gylfaginning Snorri
says that Skadi wishes to live in her father’s home in the mountains, while Njörd
wishes to be by the sea. They compromise on nine nights in each place, but the
arrangement fails. Snorri cites two verses, one spoken by each, on the disadvan
tages of the other’s home, and these presumably are from some otherwise lost
eddic poem. He ends this discussion by telling us a bit more about Skadi:
Then Skadi went up into the mountains and lives in Thrymheim, and she goes
about much on skis with a bow and arrow and shoots game. She is called snow
shoe-god or snowshoe-dís.
The concept of Skadi as snowshoe-dís is unknown in the narrative sources,
but she bears this cognomen not infrequently in early skaldic poetry. In
Lokasenna, stanza 51, she refers to her cult places, and there are place-names
that verify the worship of Skadi, especially in Sweden. Since Ull is also called
snowshoe-god and seems to have been popular in Sweden, some scholars have
seen a special connection between the two. But there is a Norwegian connection
according to Ynglinga saga, which says that after her marriage to Njörd Skadi
had multiple sons from Odin, ancestors of the Hladir jarls. Whether she is the
mother of Frey and Freyja is unknown. In the prose header to Skírnismál, when
Frey is ailing, Njörd asks Skadi to talk with him, and according this tradition,
then, she speaks the first stanza of the poem, asking Skírnir to intervene. Snorri,
too, in the section just following the description of the failed marriage of Njörd
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 269



and Skadi, says that Njörd sired Frey and Freyja “afterward.” But Ynglinga saga
numbers Frey among the hostages exchanged at the end of the war between the
æsir and vanir, and there he implies strongly that Frey and Freyja are the off
spring of a marriage between Njörd and his sister.

B. Mohr, 1941), are the most important treatments of the possible background in cult.
SKÍDBLADNIR
Frey’s magic ship (but attributed once to Odin).
Grímnismál mentions Skídbladnir in stanzas 43–44. Stanza 43 is devoted to the
ship:
The sons of Ívaldi went in days of yore
To create Skídbladnir,
The best of ships, for bright Frey,
The useful son of Njörd.
The story referred to is that of the creation of six wondrous objects for the gods
by the dwarfs: Sif’s golden hair, Skídbladnir, Draupnir; Gullinborsti, Gungnir, and
Mjöllnir, told by Snorri in Skáldskaparmál. Stanza 44 of Grímnismál lists the best
of various things, and begins “The ash Yggdrasil, it is the best of trees, / and Skíd
bladnir of ships.” Snorri quoted this stanza in Gylfaginning, and it prompted Gan
gleri to ask in what way Skídbladnir was the best of ships. Hár answered:
Skídbladnir is the best of ships and made with the greatest skill, but Naglfar is
the largest ship; Muspell owns it. Some dwarfs, the sons of Ívaldi, made Skíd
bladnir and gave the ship to Frey. It is so large that all the æsir may be aboard
with weapons and armor, and it has a fair wind, as soon as the sail is hoisted.
But when it is not to be sailed on at sea, then it is made of so many pieces and
with such great skill that it may be folded up like a handkerchief and kept in
one’s wallet.
270 Norse Mythology



Partly based on this explanation (which is repeated in Skáldskaparmál in
the story of the making of the ship by the dwarfs), scholars sometimes suggest
that the name Skídbladnir means something like “put together using thin pieces
of wood.” Of course, that description fits to some extent any ship with planks.
In chapter 7 of Ynglinga saga, Snorri assigns the ship to Odin and associates
it with his magic skills:
He could also, by words alone, extinguish fire and calm the sea and turn the
wind in any direction he wished, and he had that ship which was called Skíd
bladnir, on which he traveled over great seas, and it could be folded up like
a cloth.
Snorri seems to have imagined Skídbladnir here as part of Odin’s shamanic
attributes, for he had just told how Odin could change shape and travel in ani
mal form to distant lands on his or other people’s business. And in Ynglinga saga
Snorri also downplays the connection of Njörd and Frey with the sea, and that
may also have contributed to the unique assignment to Odin.
The ship was an important part of life in Viking and medieval Scandinavia,
and it clearly had important symbolic as well as practical value. The Bronze Age
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 271

rock carvings have ships on them, and many of the Gotland picture stones from
the eighth century depict ships crowded with armed warriors. Wealthy people
were sometimes buried in ships, and Baldr’s was only one of many funerals in
the older literature in which the corpse was burned on a ship. We might con
clude that when Frey has it, Skídbladnir is a symbol of wealth and plenty to be
regarded as parallel to the cart associated with the cult of the vanir; when Odin
has it, Skídbladnir is a means of traveling to the other world.

SKÍNFAXI (SHINING-MANE)
Horse that pulls Dag (Day), according to Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 12, and Snorri
Sturluson, who paraphrases the stanza in Gylfaginning.
Stanza 12 answers a question put by Odin to Vafthrúdnir in stanza 11: “What
horse pulls [across the sky] Dag (Day)?”
Skínfaxi he is named, who pulls the shining
Dag for people;
272 Norse Mythology
“Sun-Chariot” from Trundholm, Denmark. Found in fragments and reconstructed, it may
offer a Bronze Age predecessor of Skínfaxi. (Werner Forman/Art Resource)



Best of horses it seems among the Hreidgoths [i.e., people],
Ever the mane shines from the horse.
See also Dag; Hrímfaxi; Vafthrúdnismál
SKÖLL
Wolf; follows the sun in the sky and will swallow it.
Grimnismál, stanza 39, tells of the wolves who threaten the sun:
Sköll is the name of a wolf who accompanies the shining god
As a defense of the forest;
And the other Hati, he is the son of Hródvitnir,
That one shall be before the bright bride of heaven.
These lines are enigmatic. Snorri paraphrased them as follows in Gylfaginning:
Gangleri said: “The sun moves fast, and almost as if she were frightened; she
would not hasten her journey more, if she feared her death.” Then Hár answers:
“It is not surprising that she goes quickly. The one who seeks her is right nearby,
and she has no other way out than to run away.” Then Gangleri said: “Who is it
who makes this trouble?” Hár says: “It is two wolves, and the one who chases
her is Sköll; she is afraid of him, and he will take her, and the one who runs in
front of her is called Hati Hródvitnisson, and he will take the moon.
I rendered the last word of this passage “moon,” although it can mean either
sun or moon. Clearly Snorri has adapted these wolves to his notion of Ragnarök,
when Garm will bay and Fenrir will get loose to slay Odin. Sköll (or Skoll; the
form varies) is not known from other sources. Sköll is identical with a poetic
noun meaning “loud noise”; Skoll would be associated with a root meaning
“deceiver.”
See also Hati Hródvitnisson; Máni; Sól
SKRY ́MIR (BIG-LOOKING)
The name taken by the giant Útgarda-Loki when he travels with and deceives Thor.
The story is told in Gylfaginning, and Snorri is wholly consistent: The giant
with whom Thor and his companions travel is Skry ́mir, and the one whose hall
they visit is Útgarda-Loki. Only at the end of the entire story does Útgarda-Loki
reveal that he was Skry ́mir.
Loki refers to Skry ́mir and Thor’s inability to open the food pack sealed by
him in Lokasenna, stanza 62; in stanza 60 he had referred to Thor cowering in
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 273



the giant’s glove but did not name Skry ́mir. Odin refers to the same incident but
calls the giant Fjalar, not Skry ́mir, in Hárbardsljód, stanza 26. Skry ́mir is listed
as a giant among the thulur, but the name seems also to have been taken by a
few humans, according to some early skaldic stanzas.
See also Útgarda-Loki References and further reading: A standard work cited with relation to Skry ́mir is C. W. von Sydow’s study of giants in the mythology, “Jättarna i mytologi och folktro,” Folkminnen och folktankar 6 (1919): 52–96, which uses Skry ́mir as a kind of paradigm of the qualities of great size and control of powers of deception von Sydow thought to be typical of giants.

Chadwick looked to Russian tradition in “The Russian Giant Svyatogor and the Norse Útgartha-Loki,” Folklore 75 (1964): 243–259. Anatoly Liberman focuses ultimately on etymology but has much to say about myths of Loki in his “Snorri and Saxo on Útgardaloki, with Notes on Loki Laufeyjarson’s Character, Career, and Name,” in Saxo Grammaticus: Tra storiografia e letteratura. Bevagna, 27–29 settembre 1990 (Rome: Editrice “Il Calamo,” 1992), 91–158. My analysis is in “Thor’s Visit to Útgarƒa-Loki,” Oral Tradition 15 (2000): 1–17.
SLEIPNIR
Odin’s horse.
Grímnismál, stanza 44, has a list of things that are the foremost in various cate
gories (Yggdrasil of trees, Odin of the æsir, and so forth), and Sleipnir is included
as the best of horses. Snorri agreed; in Gylfaginning Snorri has a little list of the
horses of the æsir, which he begins with Sleipnir. “Sleipnir is best; Odin owns
him; he has eight legs.” Later Snorri quotes Grímnismál, stanza 44, and this
prompts Gangleri to ask about Sleipnir. Hár responds with the story of the build
ing of Ásgard. The giant master builder has agreed to do the work only with the
help of his horse, Svadilfari. If he succeeds in meeting the deadline, the gods must
pay him Freyja, the sun, and the moon. Three days before the deadline the work
is nearly complete, and Loki, who the gods say advised them to make the deal,
must act. He changes himself into a mare and distracts Svadilfari, and without
the horse the work cannot be finished. The master builder goes into a giant rage,
thus revealing himself as a giant, and the gods call on Thor to kill him. Not much
later Loki bears a gray eight-legged foal, the best of horses among the gods. This
274 Norse Mythology



story is alluded to in Hyndluljód, stanza 40, which is part of the “Short Völuspá,”
although in this stanza it is not absolutely clear that Loki played the female role:
Loki sired the wolf on Angrboda,
And got Sleipnir on Svadilfari. . . .
The so-called Thórgrímsthula, an anonymous poetic fragment cited in
Snorri’s Skáldskaparmál, numbers Sleipnir among the excellent horses it knows
of. The excellence or indeed superiority of Sleipnir is actually what triggers the
duel between Thor and Hrungnir, since according to Skáldskaparmál, Hrungnir
first gets into a dispute with the æsir when he and Odin each claim to possess
the best horse.
As would befit the horse of Odin, Sleipnir is used for trips to the world of
the dead. The second stanza of Baldrs draumar tells what happens after Baldr
has had disquieting dreams:
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 275

Up rose Odin, god of the ages,
And on Sleipnir he placed a saddle.
He rode down from there to Niflhel
Met a dog, which came out of Hel.
In the Baldr story in Snorri’s Gylfaginning, when Hermód rides to the world
of the dead to try to bring Baldr back, it is on Sleipnir’s back. After riding nine
dark nights he crosses the Gjallarbrú and finally comes to the gates of Hel.
Then he dismounted from the horse and girded it fast, mounted and drove with
his spurs, and the horse leapt so powerfully over the gate that he came nowhere
near it.
Book 1 of Saxo Grammaticus’s Gesta Danorum contains an episode that
many scholars think is related to Odin, Sleipnir, and journeys to the otherworld.
276 Norse Mythology

haps Sleipnir, being greeted by a female, perhaps a valkyrie at Valhöll. Note the other figure
overhead. (The Art Archive/Historiska Museet Stockholm/Dagli Orti)



The hero king Hadingus is brought into contact by a one-eyed old man with a
wanderer called Liserus. Together they challenge Lokerus, lord of Kurland, but
they are defeated. They ride away from the battle on a horse to the old man’s
home, and Hadingus is given a potion that invigorates him. On the return ride
Hadingus looks down to see that the horse is speeding through the air.
The connection with the world of the dead grants a special poignancy to one
of the kennings in which Sleipnir turns up as a horse word. This is “sea-Sleip
nir,” which Úlf Uggason used in the section of his Húsdrápa describing Baldr’s
funeral. The kenning stands for Baldr’s funeral ship. Baldr’s funeral was one of
the scenes carved as decoration in the hall of Óláf pái (Peacock) in western Ice
land, circa 985, which Úlf was describing in Húsdrápa. His use of Sleipnir in the
kenning may show that Sleipnir’s role in the failed recovery of Baldr was known
at that time and place in Iceland; it certainly indicates that Sleipnir was an
active participant in the mythology of the last decades of paganism.
Some of the eighth-century picture stones from the island of Gotland,
including those of Alskog Tjängvide and Ardre VIII, show eight-legged horses,
and most scholars accept that these represent Sleipnir. A rider sits on each, and
some scholars think this is Odin; indeed, above horse and rider on the Alskog
Tjängvide stone is a horizontal figure with a spear, perhaps a valkyrie. A woman
greets the rider holding a cup, and the entire scene has been interpreted as the
arrival of the rider in the world of the dead.
Sleipnir’s eight legs have been interpreted as an indication of great speed or
as being connected in some unclear way with cult activity.
See also Gjallarbrú; Hadingus; Loki; Odin References and further reading: Although there are no studies that limit themselves exclusively to Sleipnir, Gutorm Gjessing devotes a chapter to him in his study of the horse in art and cult, “Hesten i førhistorisk kunst og kultus,” Viking 7 (1943): 5–143. The Ardre VIII picture stone is the subject of a stimulating book by Ludwig Buisson, Der Bildstein Ardre VIII auf Gotland: Göttermythen, Heldensagen und Jenseitsglaube im 8. Jahrhundert n. Chr., Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen, phil.-hist. Kl., 3. Folge, 102 (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1976).
SLÍDRUGTANNI (DANGEROUS-TOOTH)
Alternative name for Gullinborsti, Frey’s boar.
Snorri states in both Gylfaginning and in Skáldskaparmál that Slídrugtanni is an
alternative name for Gullinborsti, but the name is found nowhere else. Since
Gullinborsti is used once as an adjective (“gold-bristled”) to describe Freyja’s
boar, Hildisvíni, and since the poet Úlf Uggason refers to Frey’s boar in his Hús
drápa not by name but as “the one with golden bristles,” it would seem possible
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 277



that the adjective gullinborsti might in time have replaced an original name,
such as Slídrugtanni.
See also Frey; Gullinborsti; Hildisvíni
SNOTRA
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists her thirteenth in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the
æsir and says this about her: “She is wise and of gentle bearing. From her desig
nation the one who is hóflátr is called a wise woman or man.” The name is clearly
connected to the adjective snotr, “wise,” and a wise person would then be hóflátr,
“moderate,” a sentiment that the gnomic stanzas of Hávamál would support.
SÓL (SUN)
The sun, personified.
Although the sun is mentioned frequently in older poetry, it is seldom personi
fied. Even a kenning like “hall of the sun” for sky may not suggest personifica
tion, given the rules of kenning formation. In poetry, only Vafthrúdnismál is
certain in its personification of the sun. In stanza 22 Odin asks the wise giant
Vafthrúdnir whence the moon and sun came to travel over people. The giant
responds in stanza 23:
Mundilfœri he is called, the father of Máni
And also of Sól the same;
Into heaven shall they turn each day,
So that people can reckon years.
Snorri concocts a somewhat different story in Gylfaginning: Mundilfœri is
a man who had two children who were so beautiful that he named them Máni
and Sól (i.e., Moon and Sun), and he married Sól to a man called Glen. The gods
punished this act of pride by placing the children in heaven to serve the actual
heavenly bodies, their creation.
Sól drives those horses that pull the carriage of that sun that the gods had cre
ated to light the worlds, out of that spark that flew from Muspellsheim. Those
horses are called Árvak and Alsvin; and under the span of the horses the gods
put two wind bellows to cool them, and in some learning that is called Ísarnkól.
Sól’s brother Máni controls the motion of the moon and its waxings and
wanings. That Sól is female and Máni male probably has to do with the gram
278 Norse Mythology



matical gender of the nouns: Sól is feminine and Máni masculine. Máni may
have had some connection with the race of giants, but no such connection is sug
gested for Sól. Sól’s husband Glen is unknown outside this passage.
When Völuspá, stanza 57, says of Ragnarök that “[t]he sun turns black, the
earth sinks into the sea,” there is no indication that either is personified. In
Gylfaginning, however, Snorri continues his account of the personified sun.
Gangleri begins the exchange:
“The sun moves fast, and almost as if she were frightened; she would not has
ten her journey more, if she feared her death.” Then Hár answers: “It is not sur
prising that she goes quickly. The one who seeks her is right nearby, and she
has no other way out than to run away.” Then Gangleri said: “Who is it who
makes this trouble?” Hár says: “It is two wolves, and the one who chases her is
Sköll; she is afraid of him, and he will take her, and the one who runs in front
of her is called Hati Hródvitnisson, and he will take the moon.”
I rendered the last word of this passage “moon,” although it can mean either
sun or moon. (Try reading the passage to see what sense you make of it if Hati
too takes the sun.) I have also rendered the animate pronoun “she” and “her,”
even though Snorri’s use of the definite article at the beginning of the passage
may suggest that he has dropped the personification or is speaking of the sun the
gods created; I used the animate pronoun because I have trouble imagining a
spark experiencing fear. Snorri is following Grimnismál, stanza 39 here, but that
passage is silent on whether Hati will attack either heavenly body.
Snorri ends the catalog of the ásynjur that comes later in Gylfaginning with
a note to the effect that Sól and Bil, “whose natures were explained above,” are
numbered among them.
The sun was of course a focus of older nature mythological and solar mytho
logical interpretations of Scandinavian and other mythologies, but as the rela
tively short length of this article shows, it would not be easy to make a case for
a central role of the sun in Scandinavian mythology as we have it.
See also Bil and Hjúki; Glen; Hati Hródvitnisson; Máni; Sköll References and further reading: For an attempt to argue for sun worship in Scandinavia (other than in today’s winter charter trips from dark Scandinavia to the sunny Mediterranean), see Vilhelm Kiil, “Er de nordiske Solberg minner om soldyrkelse?” Maal og minne, 1936: 126–175, who asked whether the placename Solberg, which transparently means “Sun-mountain,” might not be involved, even if only for the Bronze Age. The most recent work I know to foreground the importance of the sun (even if through symbols) in the extant mythology is Régis Boyer, Yggdrasil: La Religion des anciens Scandinaves,
Bibliothèque historique (Paris: Payott, 1981). Boyer wrote that three aspects of nature run throughout Scandinavian religion from the Bronze Age to the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 279



extant mythology: the sun, liquid, and the earth. Baldr, Ty ́r, and Thor, Boyer writes, were aligned with the sun, as were, during the Viking Age, law and war. This book is rarely cited, but to those who can read French it offers an idiosyncratic interpretation.
SÖRLA THÁTTR
Text famous for its presentation of the Hjadningavíg, the unending battle, but also of
interest for its presentation of the world of the gods in its opening pages.
Generically Sörla tháttr is a short fornaldarsaga (on saga genres, see chapter 1).
It is found only in Flateyjarbók, an important Icelandic manuscript from the end
of the fourteenth century, where it is one of the many thættir, “short narra
tives,” interwoven into the Great Saga of Olaf Tryggvason.
The opening lines present a version of the Learned Prehistory familiar from
the beginning of Snorri’s Ynglinga saga: To the east of Vanakvísl in Asia lived
the Æsir (here openly understood as “Asians”) in their capital city Ásgard. Odin
was the king, and it was a place of great pagan activity. He established Njörd and
Frey as chieftains presiding over the sacrifices. Freyja was the daughter of Njörd.
Up to this point there is nothing new. But then follows the statement that Freyja
was a follower of Odin and was his concubine. Seeing a beautiful necklace (the
Brísinga men?) being made by four neighboring dwarfs, she desires it, but they
will only part with it if each of them gets to spend a night with her. She agrees,
and four nights later she owns the necklace. Now Loki is introduced, as another
of Odin’s retainers. Loki finds out about the necklace and tells Odin of it, and
Odin commands Loki to get the necklace. This Loki accomplishes by turning
himself into a fly and getting into Freyja’s impenetrable bedchamber (an other
wise unknown motif). To make Freyja turn over so that he can get at the neck
lace, Loki turns himself into a flea and bites her; he then flees with the necklace.
When Freyja awakens and misses the necklace, she confronts Odin, who tells her
she can only have it back by fulfilling one rather strange condition: She must
make two kings, each of whom is served by 20 kings, fall out and engage in a
battle that through charms and magic will go on without end, unless it is inter
rupted by a Christian who serves a great king.
Although we never see Freyja or Odin again in the text (although a mysteri
ous woman calling herself by the valkyrie name Göndul does appear), this con
dition is fulfilled when two great kings, Hedin and Högni, have a falling out
when Hedin abducts Högni’s daughter Hild. Their armies fight each day for 143
years, until the arrival and intervention of Ívarr ljómi (Gleam), a retainer of Olaf
Tryggvason.
The courtly setting, with Freyja and Loki presented as retainers of Odin, is
interesting, as is the open presentation of Freyja’s sexual willingness. The intro
280 Norse Mythology



duction of Loki begins with his parents Fárbauti and Laufey (who is called Nál
[Needle], we are told, because of her slender physique), and the text goes on to
explain, without as far as I can see the slightest trace of irony, that he was known
for his cunning. For these reasons the text would appear to be post-classical.

References and further reading: Jan de Vries, The Problem of Loki, FF Communications, 110 (Helsinki: Suomalainen tiedeakatemia, 1933), 125–141, treats the text. Niels Lukman, “An Irish Source and Some Fornaldarsögur,” Mediaeval Scandinavia 10 (1977): 41–57, locates a potential source among Irish annals. Helen Damico, “Sörlaπáttr and the Hama Episode in Beowulf,” Scandinavian Studies 55 (1983): 222–235, argues that the Hama episode in Beowulf should be read against mythological rather than legendary-historical models.
STARKAD
The most famous divine hero.
Starkad was a favorite of Odin and was hated by Thor. A scene found in
Gautreks saga has Starkad brought before 12 æsir. Odin and Thor bestow alter
nate aspects of his life to come: Odin gives three lifetimes, and Thor counters
with a dastardly deed to be committed in each; Odin gives great weapons, and
Thor says he will never own land; Odin gives him wealth, and Thor says he will
never enjoy it; Odin gives victory in battles, and Thor promises many wounds in
each; Odin gives the gift of poetry, and Thor says he will never remember his
compositions; Odin gives standing among the highest in society, and Thor says
the common man will despise him. This exchange had begun with Thor’s state
ment that Starkad would be childless because his paternal grandmother, Álfhild,
had preferred a giant to Thor. This seems to allude to an incident told in one
redaction of Hervarar saga ok Heidreks konungs. A figure called Starkad
Áludreng (Ála-boy) carried off a woman called Álfhild. Her father called on Thor,
who killed Starkad Áludreng.
This Starkad Áludreng had eight arms. Saxo Grammaticus has a character
called Starcatherus (Starkad) with six arms, and he says Thor tore away four of
them to make him normal. In addition, a stanza composed in the waning days of
paganism and addressed directly to Thor praises him for killing Starkad. Saxo’s
Starcatherus dies voluntarily at the hand of the son of a king he had killed.
There must indeed have been conflicting traditions about the figure or fig
ures known as Starkad. In Saxo’s Starcatherus, however, there is a single figure,
however complex his character. He is a major figure in Books 6–8 of Gesta Dano
rum. He certainly lives out the gifts and counter-gifts bestowed on him (in Saxo
only by Odin): He lives to an enormous age; he is a great warrior, invincible in
battle, and an accomplished poet, but he commits dastardly deeds. The first is
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 281



the murder of King Víkar, at Odin’s request, during a supposedly mock sacrifice
(in Icelandic tradition, this killing is portrayed as unintended). The second is
probably Starkad’s flight from a battlefield in Jutland, and the third is clearly the
murder of King Olo, whom he had served at the great battle of Brávellir. Starkad
killed Olo for a bribe while the king was bathing.

Alf Hiltebeitel (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1971), and The Stakes of the Warrior, trans. David Weeks, ed.

James Milroy, “Starkaƒr: An Essay in Interpretation,” Saga-Book of the Viking Society 19 (1974–1977), 118–138, attempts to read Starkad as a “literary myth.” For useful analysis of Starkad in Saxo, consult Inge SkovgaardPetersen, Starkad in Saxo’s Gesta Danorum: History and Heroic Tale (Odense: Odense Universitetsforlag, 1985).
SURT
Giant particularly associated with Ragnarök.
Völuspá, stanza 52, sets Surt’s departure to do battle with the gods as part of the
general chaos that will reign when the world ends at Ragnarök and makes it
clear that he has to do with the conflagration that will ensue:
Surt travels from the south with the enemy of twigs [fire],
The sun shines from the swords of the carrion-gods,
Mountains resound, and ogresses roam,
Humans tread the road to Hel, and the sky is riven.
Previously, in stanza 47, the poet had called the wolf who swallows the sun
“the companion of Surt.”
Asking where the last battle will take place, the giant Vafthrúdnir puts it
this way in stanza 17 of Vafthrúdnismál: Tell me, he says,
What that field is called where will meet in battle
Surt and the beloved gods.
In Fáfnismál, Sigurd asks the dying dragon Fáfnir a very similar question.
Tell me, he says,
282 Norse Mythology



14. What that island is called, where they will mix in a sword game,
Surt and the æsir together.
Fáfnir responds:
15. Óskópnir it is called, and there shall all
The gods make play with spears.
These passages suggest strongly that Surt and his fire could stand for all of
Ragnarök. Another exchange in Vafthrúdnismál strengthens this supposition.
Odin asks about the aftermath of Ragnarök, and Vafthrúdnir responds:
50. Which æsir will rule the possessions of the gods,
When Surt’s fire dies down?
51. Vídar and Váli will inhabit the holy places of the gods,
When Surt’s fire dies down.
Surt plays an active role at Ragnarök, for according to Völuspá, stanza 53, he
goes up against Frey and kills him.
As is usual, Snorri Sturluson has more to say. In the Gylfaginning section of
his Edda, he assigns Surt to the fiery world of Muspell:
That one is called Surt, who sits there at the end of the world as a guardian.
He has a burning sword, and at the end of the world he will travel and harry
and defeat all the gods and burn the entire world with fire.
When Snorri gets to Ragnarök at the end of Gylfaginning, he writes that Surt
rides first of the sons of Muspell, with fire before and after him, with a sword
that shines more brightly than if the sun were reflected from it. After the indi
vidual gods have fallen, Surt casts fire over the earth and burns the entire world.
The name Surt is used in poetry as a general name for a giant. It meant some
thing like “black,” as if he were charred.
See also Muspell; Ragnarök
References and further reading: Bertha S. Phillpotts, “Surt,” Arkiv för nordisk
filologi 21 (1905): 14–30, argued that Surt was a “volcano-giant,” which would give him a special association with Iceland, where volcanic activity remains common. Indeed, when a volcanic island erupted fresh from the waters off Iceland in 1963, it was named Surtsey (Surt’s-island).

SUTTUNG
Giant from whom Odin obtains the mead of poetry.
Suttung is mentioned in both major versions of the story of Odin’s acquisition
of the mead of poetry, in Hávamál, stanzas 104–110, and the Skáldskaparmál of
Snorri Sturluson’s Edda. In one sense we might say that the story of the mead of
poetry, especially as Snorri spells it out, is a story about Suttung’s family. Sut
tung obtains the mead, in compensation for their murder of his parents, from the
dwarfs Fjalar and Galar, who made it from the blood of Kvasir. He entrusts the
mead to his daughter Gunnlöd, to whom Odin gains access after Suttung’s
brother Baugi drills a hole into the mountain where Gunnlöd is staying. Only
after Odin leaves in the form of an eagle does Suttung play an active role: Also
in the form of an eagle, he pursues Odin. The pursuit is so close that Odin can
not get all the mead back into the possession of the æsir, and he urinates a bit
out; this portion makes bad poets. Thus we have Suttung to blame for the lyrics
of most pop songs.
See also Baugi, Fjalar; Gunnlöd; Mead of Poetry
SYN
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists Syn eleventh in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the
æsir and says this about her: “She manages the doors of the hall and closes the
doors before those who are not to go in, and she is established at assemblies as a
defense against those cases which she wishes to disprove. Thus there is a proverb
that syn [denial] is seen when someone says no.” The goddess is otherwise
unknown, but her name does appear in the thulur and a few times in woman
kennings in skaldic poetry.
SY ́R (SOW)
Name for Freyja.
Snorri says in Gylfaginning that Freyja has many names because she took on dif
ferent names among the various peoples she encountered when she went to
search for her missing husband, Ód. Freyja bears this name in no extant narra
tive, but the skaldic kenning “tear of Sy ́r” supports it, and it is listed in the thu
lur. Freyja as “sow” would accord with the notion of her as a fertility deity.

284 Norse Mythology



THJÁLFI
Thor’s human servant and companion.
The story of how Thjálfi and his sister Röskva came to be Thor’s human servants
is told as part of the first section of the long myth of Thor’s visit to Útgarda-Loki
in Snorri’s Gylfaginning. Traveling with Loki, Thor comes to the home of a cer
tain farmer and arranges lodgings for the night. Thor slaughters his goats and
boils them and then invites the farmer and the rest of the household to eat the
meat; they are to cast the bones onto the skins, which he has spread out nearby.
While they are eating, Thjálfi, the farmer’s son, cuts one of the bones with his
knife to get at the marrow. The next morning Thor waves his hammer over the
piles of skin and bones, and the goats arise whole, but one is lame. Thor goes into
a rage, and in their terror the humans beg for mercy. Seeing their fear, Thor
relents, and in compensation he takes Thjálfi and Röskva, and they have been
his servants ever since.
Although most of the attention paid to this story has focused on the revival
of the goats, I believe that a far more important aspect is the relationship
between humans and gods. Because of a failure to carry out a ritual properly, the
god is angry, and the humans rightly fear his wrath. But when they beg for mercy
he grants it, and the result is a closer relationship between the humans and the
gods.
Thjálfi accompanies Thor on the next leg of the journey, which is to the land
of the giants, and he carries Thor’s pack. When Útgarda-Loki calls for demon
strations of skill or ability, Thjálfi, “the swiftest of all humans,” proposes a
footrace. He loses three heats to Útgarda-Loki’s retainer Hugi, and although he
comes a bit closer in each heat, even in the third he is only halfway around the
course when Hugi has finished. Later we learn that Hugi is the same as the noun
hugi, “thought”; that is, he is Útgarda-Loki’s thought, so the defeat is hardly
humiliating, as is indeed the case with the other contests undertaken at Útgarda
Loki’s court by Loki and Thor.
In the Skáldskaparmál of his Edda, Snorri tells the story of Thor’s duel with
Hrungnir, and there too Thjálfi plays a role, both as Thor’s second and as the
killer of a secondary monster. Thjálfi contributes materially to Thor’s victory
over Hrungnir, the strongest of giants, by falsely warning Hrungnir that Thor
will attack from below. The giant stands on his shield and therefore cannot use
it when Thor hurls the hammer at him. Thjálfi, meanwhile, faces Mökkurkálfi,
a figure nine leagues tall and three leagues wide, made of clay but with the heart
of a mare, which is unsteady when Thor approaches. Indeed, the clay giant was
so consumed with fear when Thor approached that he wet himself. After giving
the details of the closely matched encounter between Thor and Hrungnir, Snorri
adds laconically “and Thjálfi attacked Mökkurkálfi, who fell with little glory.”
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 285



Hrungnir is defeated, and Thjálfi attempts to lift Hrungnir’s lifeless leg off Thor
but cannot; that job is left to Thor’s infant son Magni. Magni’s success after
Thjálfi’s failure may give some indication of the god-human hierarchy in the
mythology.
Following Georges Dumézil, many observers, especially those who, like
Dumézil, approach the material from the Indo-European side, see here a reflec
tion of warrior initiation: Under the tutelage of an elder warrior, the initiant
“slays” a made monster. I find the theory attractive even though there is noth
ing in Snorri’s text to indicate that Thjálfi’s status changes after the encounter
with Mökkurkálfi, which we would expect in an initiatory context. Made mon
sters turn up in all sorts of cultures, not always in initiatory contexts (e.g.,
golems).
According to the Thórsdrápa of the tenth-century skald Eilíf Godrúnarson,
Thjálfi accompanied Thor on his journey to the giant Geirröd. The ninth and
tenth stanzas seem to show Thjálfi clinging to Thor as the river Vimur rises, but
neither of them is fearful. Apparently Eilíf thought Thjálfi participated in the
struggles with Geirröd and his daughters alongside Thor. A half-stanza that edi
tors put at the end of the poem seems to give the two equal weight:
Angry stood Röskva’s brother,
The father of Magni struck for gain.
Neither Thor’s nor Thjálfi’s
Stone of strength [heart] trembled with fear.
Snorri has Loki accompany Thor on this journey, and indeed it sometimes
seems that there was a structural slot, “companion of Thor,” that was filled
sometimes by Loki and sometimes by Thjálfi. The etymology of the name is
unclear, but it was used in the human community too, as several Swedish runic
inscriptions show.

Georges Dumézil presents the evidence for Thjálfi and Mökkurkálfi as an initiation story in chapter 4, “From Storm to Pleasure,” in his Gods of the Ancient Northmen, ed. Einar Haugen, Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology, 3 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1973), 66–79. The notion of Thjálfi and Loki as reflexes of the same character, the companion of the thunder god, was argued by Axel Olrik, “Tordenguden og hans dreng,” Danske studier 2 (1905): 129–146.
286 Norse Mythology



THJAZI
Giant, father of Skadi, abductor of Idun and her apples.
The story is found in the skaldic poem Haustlöng, by Thjódólf of Hvin, and in
the Skáldskaparmál section of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda. Odin, Hœnir, and Loki
are traveling and find themselves unable to cook an ox. An eagle in the tree
above claims responsibility and says the ox will cook if he may have some. How
ever, when he tries to take a vast amount, Loki strikes at him with a staff. The
staff sticks to the eagle and to Loki’s hand, and the eagle flies off with Loki in
tow. As he bangs against things, Loki agrees to the eagle’s demand: that he bring
him Idun and her apples. This he does, and without their apples, the gods grow
old and gray. They force Loki to agree to get Idun back. In Freyja’s falcon coat he
flies to Jötunheimar, changes Idun into a nut, and flies off with her. Thjazi pur
sues in the form of an eagle. The gods kindle a fire just as Loki flies into Ásgard,
and Thjazi’s feathers are singed and he falls to the earth and is killed by the gods.
This is one of the most dangerous moments for the gods in the mythologi
cal present, for giants are not supposed to be able to mate with goddesses. The
fact that the gods grow old and gray—that is, display mortality—indicates what
would happen if the flow of females, ordinarily from the giants to the gods, were
to be reversed.
See also Idun; Skadi
References and further reading: In her Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Icelandic Society, vol. 1: The Myths (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), Margaret Clunies Ross makes clear the importance of the direction of the passage of marriageable women, and on pages 115–119 she analyzes the Idun-Thjazi myth in some detail. Another interesting approach is that of Anne Holtsmark, “Myten om Idun og Tjatse i Tjodolvs Haustlo ̧ng,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 64 (1949): 1–73, who argued for a background in ritual drama.
THOR
God who specializes in killing giants.
Thor is the son of Odin and Jörd (Earth), the husband of Sif, and the father of sons
Módi and Magni and a daughter, Thrúd. Virtually all of Thor’s myths have to do
with giantslaying. He slays the strongest giant, Hrungnir, in a duel. He kills Geir
röd, and more famously Geirröd’s daughters, on a visit to that giant. He kills
Thrym, and all the giants in his family, when he goes off to Thrym in the guise of
Freyja, supposedly to be given to Thrym in exchange for Thor’s stolen hammer.
He kills Hymir and a host of giants when he goes off to Hymir’s home in Giant
land to acquire from him a huge kettle in which the gods will brew beer. He kills
the giant who built the wall around Ásgard. His greatest struggle was with the
Midgard serpent, the most powerful giant of all, whom he fished up out of the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 287



deep sea. Earlier skaldic sources sug
gest that Thor killed the monster,
but Snorri Sturluson contradicts
this in the Gylfaginning section of
his Edda. Snorri and Völuspá have
him meet the serpent again at Rag
narök. They kill each other, but
Thor staggers back nine steps before
succumbing to the serpent’s poison,
and this suggests a kind of small vic
tory snatched from the greater
defeats the gods are suffering.
Thor also kills dwarfs, al
though less deliberately. In Alvíss
mál he keeps the dwarf who is
trying to woo his daughter up until
sunrise answering questions about
poetic vocabulary (not otherwise a
known interest of Thor’s), and the
sun’s first ray kills the dwarf. At
Baldr’s funeral he redirects his
anger at the giantess Hyrrokkin to the dwarf Lit, whom he kicks into the fire.
Thor could be outdone through the use of magic, an area into which he
never ventures. Thus, when traveling with the giant Skry ́mir, Thor is unable to
kill him because, as he learns later, the giant magically redirected the blows of
Thor’s hammer. After Skry ́mir and Thor part ways, Thor and his traveling com
panions are defeated in various contests at the hall of Útgarda-Loki partly
through magic, as when Thor thinks he is lifting a cat but is in fact lifting the
Midgard serpent, and partly through linguistic dullness, as when Thor fails to
realize that the old lady he wrestles named “Old Age” is in fact old age. A sim
ilar lack of linguistic awareness, or perhaps a lack of awareness of poetic forms,
makes Thor come out the loser when he engages in a contest of words with a fer
ryman, Odin in disguise, in Hárbardsljód. But Thor is the only god capable of
shutting Loki up when he is reviling all the gods in Lokasenna, and Thor is also
the one who contributes most to the capture of Loki that leads to his binding.
Thor very frequently travels in the company of an assistant, most often
Thjálfi but also on occasion Loki or Ty ́r. Thjálfi is a human, and his accompa
nying Thor indicates the close relationship between Thor and humans, a rela
tionship also attested by the metal artifacts known as Thor’s hammers. These
objects, miniature hammers that were worn about the neck, are the only indica

tion from the archaeological record
of talismans associated with specific
accouterments of the gods. Thor was
probably the most important god of
late paganism, as is suggested by the
presentation in medieval Scandina
vian sources of the conversion as a
struggle between Thor and Christ.
During the last years of pagan
ism in Iceland, poets left us with
two fragments of poems addressed
directly to Thor, in the second per
son. These are mostly lists of giants
he killed. Some of the giants are
known, but some are not, and it is
clear that we no longer have all the
relevant mythology about Thor. It
would be nice to know, for example,
about his killing of Thrívaldi
(Thrice-powerful), who may be asso
ciated with a nine-headed giant
mentioned by the skald Bragi. One
of the interesting aspects of these
lists of Thor’s victims is the relative
frequency of female names. Thor
was not just a giantslayer but also a
giantess-slayer. The forces of chaos
had a strong female side.
Thor is persistently presented as
crossing rivers. The most spectacu
lar of these rivers is Vimur, but there is another set he crosses, according to
Grímnismál, stanza 29:
Körmt and Örmt and two Kerlaugar,
Those Thor shall cross,
Each day, when he goes to judge
At the ash of Yggdrasil.
Thor’s crossing of rivers may have to do with the fact that he does his busi
ness mostly in the realm of the giants, who live on the other sides of boundaries,

but it is also worth recalling the symbolic association between giants and water,
as can be seen in the abode of the Midgard serpent out in the deep sea.

THRÚD (STRENGTH)
Daughter of Thor.
We know about Thrúd only from kennings. Snorri says in Skáldskaparmál that
“father of Thrúd” is a valid Thor kenning, and there is evidence that skalds
indeed used the kenning. Thrúd also turns up as the base word in woman ken
nings. What is most interesting, however, is a kenning for the giant Hrungnir in
Bragi Boddason the Old’s Ragnarsdrápa, stanza 1: “thief of Thrúd.” The kenning
suggests a now lost myth of the abduction of Thrúd by the giant, portrayed on
the shield that Bragi is describing a century or so before the conversion to Chris
tianity. Such a myth could certainly have added an extra dimension to the duel
between Hrungnir and Thor.

THRÚDGELMIR (STRENGTH-YELLER)
Primeval giant.
Thrúdgelmir is mentioned only in stanza 29 of Vafthrúdnismál. Odin has asked
Vafthrúdnir who was the oldest of the æsir or kin of Ymir. The answer is three
generations of giants: Aurgelmir, Thrúdgelmir, and Bergelmir. Aurgelmir,
according to this poem, was the proto-giant whose hermaphroditic monstrous
acts of procreation produced the race of giants (he was Ymir by another name,
according to Snorri). And some event involving Bergelmir, probably his funeral,
was the oldest event that Vafthrúdnir himself actually remembered. Thrúdgel
mir has no story. He is not mentioned in Snorri or anywhere else. Perhaps the
poet felt compelled to give the proto-giants a three-generation genealogy and
invented Thrúdgelmir. His name is the most obvious of the three, and that could
suggest that it did not come down in oral tradition.
See also Aurgelmir; Bergelmir; Ymir
THRÚDHEIM (STRENGTH-WORLD)
Home of Thor.
In Grímnismál, when the disguised Odin, hung between the fires, is given a
drink by the young Agnar (stanza 3), he begins to pronounce his visions. Thrúd
heim, the first thing he reports seeing, is the subject of the whole of stanza 4:
A land is holy, which I see situated
Near the æsir and elves;
Still in Thrúdheim shall Thor be,
Until the powers are riven.
In Gylfaginning and Ynglinga saga Snorri says consistently that Thor lives
in Thrúdvangar, not Thrúdheim, although one manuscript of the Edda does refer
to Thrúdheim where the others have Thrymheim, the residence of the giant
Thjazi and his daughter Skadi. However, in the euhemerized discussion of the
æsir in Tyrkland, Snorri says that Trór, “whom we call Thor,” conquered for
himself the kingdom of Thrace, “which we call Thrúdheim.” At its first men
tion in Gylfaginning, Thrúdvangar is also called a kingdom.
See also Thrúdvangar; Thrymheim
292 Norse Mythology



THRÚDVANGAR (STRENGTH-FIELDS)
Home of Thor.
This name is not attested in poetry, but it is Snorri’s preferred form. When he
introduces Thor in Gylfaginning, Snorri calls him the strongest god and says that
he has a kingdom “where it is called Thrúdvangar, and his hall is called Bil
skírnir.” In Ynglinga saga, chapter 5, Thrúdvangar is the place assigned to Thor
when Odin gives residences to his principal followers after arriving in Sweden.
See also Bilskírnir; Thrúdheim
THRYMHEIM (DIN-WORLD)
Home of the giants Thjazi and Skadi.
Grímnismál, stanza 11, includes this place in the list of residences of gods:
The sixth is called Thrymheim, where Thjazi lived,
That powerful giant;
Now Skadi there still inhabits, shining bride of the gods,
The ancient dwelling of her father.
Thus the marriage of Skadi to Njörd, after the death of her father, qualifies
her residence for inclusion in the list of gods’ residences despite her giant eth
nicity. In Gylfaginning Snorri names Thrymheim (“that dwelling, which her
father had owned; it is on some mountains, where it is called Thrymheim”) as
the place where Njörd and Skadi spent nine nights alternating with their nine
nights at Nóatún, Njörd’s residence, before the marriage broke up; in the mytho
logical present, Thrymheim is Skadi’s residence. In one manuscript of Snorri’s
Edda the scribe wrote “Thrúdheim” where the other manuscripts have
“Thrymheim.” Thrúdheim is supposed to be Thor’s residence. We might also
perhaps expect the giant Thrym to dwell at a place named after him, but
Thrymheim is the only mythological name beginning with Thrym-, and there is
no connection with the giant Thrym.

THRYMSKVIDA (THE POEM OF THRYM)
Eddic poem telling of Thor’s recovery of his hammer from the giant Thrym.
The poem is found only in Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda. It begins with Thor
awakening in anger to find his hammer missing (stanza 1). He calls on Loki (2),
and the two visit Freyja and ask to borrow her feather coat (3). She agrees (4), and
Loki flies off to Giantland (5). There Thrym sits, the lord of the domain (6), and
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 293



a dialogue ensues in which Thrym admits having the hammer and demands in
exchange Freyja as his bride (7–8). Loki flies back to Ásgard (9), where Thor
greets him (10). Loki delivers the news (11). Once more the two go to visit Freyja
to ask her to go off to Giantland (12), which she adamantly refuses to do (13). The
æsir assemble (14), and wise old Heimdall suggests dressing up Thor as Freyja
(15–16). Thor demurs, citing the potential stain on his manhood (17), but Loki
reminds him of the stakes: “The giants will immediately / inhabit Ásgard, /
unless you get your hammer / back for yourself” (18). The gods dress Thor as a
bride (19), and Loki states a willingness to go along as a serving woman (20).
Mountains break and the earth burns as they travel (21). In Giantland Thrym has
the giants prepare for Freyja’s arrival (22–23). But when the feast begins, the bride
eats an entire ox, eight salmon, and all the delicacies intended for the ladies, and
“she” drinks three barrels of mead (24). The giant wonders at this appetite (25),
but Loki responds that Freyja has not eaten for eight nights, so eager was she to
come to Jötunheimar (26). Thrym lifts the bride’s veil and is horrified by the
burning eyes it conceals (27). Loki counters that Freyja has not slept for eight
nights, so eager was she to come to Jötunheimar (28). Thrym’s sister asks for a
gift of love (29), but Thor asks that the hammer be brought in to hallow the mar
riage (30). The final two stanzas show Thor in a familiar role:
31. Hlórridi [Thor]’s heart laughed in his breast
when the tough-minded one received the hammer.
First he killed Thrym, the lord of the giants,
And he smashed the entire family of the jötun.
32. He killed the aged sister of the jötnar,
the one who had asked for a bridal gift.
She got a bash instead of a multitude of rings.
Thus Odin’s son got his hammer back.
This myth is utterly unknown in other sources, and scholars have therefore
speculated that it must have been of very late date, that is, from the late twelfth
or even the thirteenth century. However, many arguments have been advanced
about possible Indo-European cognates, myths about the theft and recovery of a
thunder weapon. Furthermore, it is possible that a very old myth might only
have been rendered into eddic poetry at a late date, although there is still the
problem that only the late skalds make any reference to the myth. But whatever
the date of myth and poem, Thrymskvida is absolutely consistent with the rest
of the mythology. As in Hymiskvida, Thor travels with an assistant in order to
retrieve a valuable object from the giants. As in the myth of his visit to Geirröd,
Thor travels to Giantland with a companion but without his weapons, and he
kills male and female giants there. His disguise as a woman appears strange, but
294 Norse Mythology



Odin too was open to accusations of perversion (as cross-dressing was under
stood in medieval Scandinavian culture), and that the god of might should have
to undergo this apparent humiliation shows how close the ongoing battle is
between gods and giants. The poem as we have it also shows how stupid the
giants are, for Thrym allows Loki to talk him out of the evidence that is right
before him.
See also Loki; Thor References and further reading: An Indo-European background was suggested by Georges Dumézil in his very first publication, Le festin d’immortalité, étude de mythologie comparée indo-européenne, Annales du museé Guimet, bibliothèque des études, 34 (Paris: Geuthne, 1924), but Thrymskvida never figured large in the Dumézilian ouevre. The most detailed discussion of a possible Indo-European background is that of Franz Rolf Schröder, “Thors Hammerholung,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur (Tübingen) 87 (1965): 1–42. Samuel Singer, “Die Grundlagen der Thrymskvidha,” Neophilologus 17 (1931): 47–48, proposed Arabic as well as Indo-European parallels, and Martin Puhvel, “The Deicidal Otherworld Weapon in Celtic and Germanic Mythic Tradition,” Folklore 83 (1972): 210–219, saw a myth of a cosmic struggle between celestial gods, probably of Indo-European origin. Alfred Vestlund, “Åskgudens hammare förlorad: Ett bidrag till nordisk ritforskning,” Edda 11 (1919): 95–119, and Wolfgang Schultz, “Die Felsritzung von Hvitlycke und das Edda-Lied von Thrym,” Mannus 21 (1929): 52, argued for a possible ritual background, Vestlund mostly on the basis of the text itself and Schultz through a hypothetical connection with Bronze Age rock carvings. In his huge monograph on Thor, Tor: Undersökningar i indoeuropeisk och nordisk religionshistoria, vol. 1: Den nordiska åskguden och besläktade indoeuropeiska gudar: Den nordiska åskguden i bild och myt, Uppsala universitets årsskrift, 1947:9 (Uppsala: Lundequistska Bokhandeln, 1947; summary in French), Helge Ljungberg worked with the assumption that Thor was a thunder god and explained the apparently jocular view of Thor expressed in Thrymskvida as the result of the relative scarcity of summer thunder in Iceland. Others have sought the origin of Thrymskvida in loans from various places. Edith Smith Krappe, “The Casina of Plautus and the ∏rymskviƒa,” Scandinavian Studies 6 (1920): 198–201, argued for Ireland; Otto Loorits, “Das Märchen vom gestohlenen Donnerinstrument bei den Esten,” Sitzungs
berichte der Gelehrten Estnischen Gesellschaft, 1930: 47–121, argued for Russia; and Uku Masing, “Die Entstehung des Märchens vom gestohlenen Donnerinstrument (Aarne-Thompson 1148B),” Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum 81 (1944): 23–31, argued for the Middle East. The classic argument for a late date was advanced by Jan de Vries in “Over de dateering der ∏rymskviƒa,” Tijdschrift voor nederlandse taal- en letterkunde 47 (1928): 251–372, which followed by only a few years the valiant attempt of Jöran Sahlgren in his
Eddica et scaldica. Fornvästnordiska studier, Nordisk filologi, undersökningar och handlingar, 1 (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1927–1928) to prove that Thrymskvida had to antedate the late-tenth-century Eiríksmál. Thrymskvida as par

Niemeyer, 1972; also issued as a supplement to Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur [Tübingen], 94, Supplement). Otto Höfler, “Götterkomik: Zur Selbstrelativierung des Mythos,” Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum 100 (1971): 371–389, wonders how believers could laugh at a deity; A. Ya Gurevich, “On the Nature of the Comic in the Elder Edda: A Comment on an Article by Professor Höfler,” Mediaeval Scandinavia 9 (1976): 127–137, tries to provide an answer. Peter Hallberg, “Om ∏rymskviƒa,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 69 (1954): 51–77, proposed Snorri Sturluson as the author of Thrymskvida, and various arguments for and against were advanced until Gustav Lindblad, “Snorre Sturlasson och eddadiktningen,” Saga och sed, 1978: 17–34, showed convincingly that Snorri had little association with eddic poetry in any way. My own analysis of the poem is in “∏rymskviƒa, Myth, and Mythology,” in Germanic Studies in Honor of Anatoly
Liberman, ed. Martha Berryman, Kurt Gustav Goblirsch, and Marvin Taylor, NOWELE, 31/32 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1997), 203–212.
TUISTO
Proto-being of the Germanic peoples, according to the Germania of Tacitus.
In chapter 2 of his Germania Tacitus writes the following statement:
They celebrate in ancient songs . . . a god Tuisto, born from the earth, and his
son Mannus as the origin and founders of their people. To Mannus they assign
three sons, from whose names are called the Ingaevones near the ocean, those
in the center as Herminones, and the rest Istaevones.
The name Tuisto appears to have in it the root of the word “two,” and this
has reminded many observers of Ymir, whose name meant something like
“doubled.” Ymir sired the races of frost giants through monstrous hermaphro
ditic conception and is presented in the mythology as essentially a negative fig
ure; indeed, his killing makes possible the creation of the cosmos. Tuisto, on the
other hand, is “celebrated,” and there is nothing negative about him in what
Tacitus says. He is the father of Mannus (Human), who in turn produces the
tribes of human beings.
References and further reading: A fine general treatment of Tuisto and the creation story in Germania is that of Marco Scovazzi, “Tuisto e Mannus nel II capitolo della Germania di Tacitus,” Istituto Lombardo: Accademia di scienze e lettere, rendiconti, classe di letteri 104 (1970): 323–336. The “doubled” nature of Ymir and identity with Tuisto were argued by Richard M. Meyer, “Beiträge zur altgermanischen Mythologie,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 23 (1907): 245–256, and “Ymi-Tuisto,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 25 (1909): 333.
296 Norse Mythology



TY ́R
One of the æsir, lost his hand in the binding of the wolf Fenrir.
This event is alluded to directly in Lokasenna, stanza 38. Loki is upbraiding Ty ́r:
Shut up, Ty ́r. You never knew how
To mediate something good between two people
Your right hand, that one will I mention
Which Fenrir tore from you.
“To mediate something good between two people” is the standard transla
tion, but an attractive alternative, given what happens next, would be “to carry
something well with two [hands].”
Snorri tells the myth twice in Gylfaginning. On the first occasion, he is
describing Ty ́r and as a token of Ty ́r’s bravery:
when the æsir enticed the wolf of Fenrir to permit the fetter to be put on him,
then he did not believe that they would release him, until they placed the hand
of Ty ́r as a pledge in his mouth. And when the æsir were unwilling to release
him, then he bit the hand off, where it is now called the “wolf’s joint” [wrist],
and Ty ́r is one-handed and not called a peacemaker.
A few pages later Snorri tells the full story. When the gods learned that
Loki’s evil offspring with Angrboda were being raised in Jötunheimar, they dis
covered through prophecy that this brood would be trouble for them, and Odin
had them brought to him. He cast the Midgard serpent into the sea and Hel into
the world of the dead. For reasons that are unclear (because Odin had a connec
tion with wolves? Because Loki was Odin’s blood brother?), the gods raised the
wolf with them, and only Ty ́r was brave enough to feed it. But when they saw
how quickly it was growing and reconsidered the prophecies, they decided to
bind the wolf. First they tried with two ordinary fetters, but the wolf easily broke
them. The gods now turned to magic. Alfödr (Odin) sent Skírnir to the dwarfs to
obtain a fetter, Gleipnir (perhaps “Entangler”), made from cat noise and woman
beard and mountain roots and bear sinews and fish breath and bird spittle. On
the island Lyngvi (Heathery) in the lake Ámsvartnir (Red-black), they invited the
wolf to let himself be bound again. Needless to say, the wolf was suspicious.
What renown could there be in bursting this fetter, which looked like a silken
band? Fenrir stipulated that someone had to place his hand in his mouth.
And each of the æsir looked at another and thought that now their troubles had
doubled, but none would put forth his hand, until Ty ́r stretched forth his right
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 297



hand and put it into the mouth of the wolf. And when the wolf moved, then the
fetter hardened, and the more he struggled, the sharper it became. Then all the
gods laughed except Ty ́r; he lost his hand.
Lokasenna, stanzas 37–40, comprise an exchange between Ty ́r and Loki.
Loki boasts that Fenrir tore off Ty ́r’s hand; Ty ́r responds that although he may
be missing his hand, Loki is missing Hródrsvitnir, that is, the famous wolf Fen
rir. Málsháttakvædi, a poem of the twelfth or thirteenth century and usually
thought to have been composed in the Orkneys, is the only poem to refer to the
binding of Fenrir. It has been argued that Ty ́r and Fenrir appear on the eighth
century Alskog Tjängvide picture stone from Gotland.
In Hymiskvida Ty ́r accompanies Thor to the giant Hymir to get a huge
kettle in which to brew beer. Ty ́r is the one who knows of the existence of this
cauldron, and he tells Thor about it in what the poet calls a “great loving coun
sel,” which is stanza 5 of the poem:
There dwells east of the Élivágar
Exceedingly wise Hymir, at the edge of heaven.
My father, the powerful one, owns a kettle,
A huge pot, a league deep.
Hymir is indeed a giant, and how Ty ́r got a giant for a father is one of the
true mysteries of this mythology. The identity of his mother also poses a prob
lem. She is mentioned in stanza 8:
The son met the mother, much loathsome to him,
She had nine hundred heads.
Another still went forth, all in gold,
White about the brows, to bear beer to her son.
Is Ty ́r’s mother the loathsome multiheaded creature or the golden one bear
ing beer? Neither possibility is attractive. If the monster is Ty ́r’s mother, he
would appear to be wholly of giant stock. If the golden one is his mother, she
may be one of the æsir, and a union between giant and goddess violates every
principle of the mythology. However, we can console ourselves with the notice
in the Skáldskaparmál section of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda that a kenning for Ty ́r
is “son of Odin.” In any case, one of these women, probably the second one,
since she is referred to as “the beautiful concubine” (stanza 30), gives Thor use
ful advice when he is required to break a cup: He must throw it at the giant’s
head. With the cup broken, the gods can now take the kettle, but Ty ́r cannot lift
298 Norse Mythology



it. Thor lifts it, and they depart with yet another valuable object obtained from
the giants.
According to Snorri Sturluson in the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Ty ́r
will fight with another bound monster at Ragnarök (Fenrir will be busy with
Odin). This is Garm, who was bound at Gnipahellir but who will run free as the
end of the world approaches. He and Ty ́r will kill each other.
Ty ́r’s name is found in the weekday name Tuesday, which is a translation
of Latin Dies Martis (Day of Mars); as Mars was a god of war, so must the Ger
manic predecessor of Ty ́r have been. Etymologically Ty ́r’s name is related to an
Indo-European root meaning “deity” (e.g., compare Latin deus), and in fact the
formal plural of Ty ́r would be tívar, and this is attested as a collective for all the
gods. This would also explain such Odin names as Sigty ́r (Victory-Ty ́r) or
Hangaty ́r (Ty ́r-of-the-hanged).

ULL
Enigmatic god.
Although Grímnismál, stanza 5, assigns Ull a home at Y ́dalir (Yew-dales), Ull is
only a shadowy figure in the preserved mythology. Snorri Sturluson included
him in the catalog of æsir in the Gylfaginning section of his Edda toward the end
of the list (only Forseti follows), where he had this to say about him:
There is one called Ull, the son of Sif and stepson of Thor. He is such a good
archer, and so good on skis that none can compete with him. He is also fair of
face and has the ability of a warrior. It is good to call on him in a duel.
In the Skáldskaparmál section of his Edda, Snorri says that Ull may be
called Sif’s son and Thor’s stepson as well as god of skis, of bows, of hunting, and
of shields, and these kennings are attested in skaldic poetry. Regarding shields,
it should be noted that a shield might be called “Ull’s ship,” which suggests per
haps that he transported himself on it, rather as a snow boarder today might. In
Book 3 of his Gesta Danorum, Saxo Grammaticus has a character called Ollerus,
who is clearly Ull in Latin form. This figure replaced Odin when that god was
exiled because of disgust over his rape of Rinda to get an avenger for Balderus.
When Odin returns, Ollerus is in turn exiled and finally killed. He was, Saxo

says, such a cunning magician that he could travel over the sea on a bone; Viking
Age bone skates are known from the archaeological record.
Two curious passages in eddic poetry refer to Ull, one to his grace (Grím
nismál, stanza 42), the other to an oath sworn on his ring (Atlakvida, stanza 30).
These tantalizing details might be connected with the story in Saxo to suggest
that Ull was some kind of sovereign figure. The etymology of his name, which
means something like “glory,” might suggest that he was once a sky god of some
sort, but, except for relatively infrequent displays of the Northern Lights, there
isn’t much glorious sky in the deep Scandinavian winters, when skis and skates
are useful. Ull turns up frequently in place-names in Norway and Sweden, and
he must once have been an important god.
See also Rind
References and further reading: The small scholarly literature devoted to Ull depends largely on the place-name evidence and is concerned with reconstructing a cult that is far older than the mythological records that are the subject of this book. Niels Åge Nielsen argues bravely but, I fear, on rather sparse evidence, that the Sparlösa runic inscription (ca. 800 C.E.?) is all about Ull (whom he regards as identical to Frey), in “Frey, Ull, and the Sparlösa Stone,” Mediaeval Scandinavia 2 (1969): 102–128.
URDARBRUNN (WELL-OF-URD)
Well at the center of Ásgard.
Völuspá, stanza 19, associates the well with Yggdrasil, the world tree:
I know an ash tree that stands, called Yggdrasil,
A tall tree, sprinkled with white mud;
Thence come the dews that run into valleys,
Forever it stands green over the Urdarbrunn.
In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri Sturluson mentions the roots
of Yggdrasil.
The third root of the ash stands in heaven and under that root is that well which
is very holy and is called the Urdarbrunn; there the gods have their place of
judgment. Each day the æsir ride up there on Bilröst.
Urd was one of the norns, and if we take literally the name of this well, it
must have a special association with fate. Under another root of Yggdrasil is
Mímisbrunn, the well of Mímir, and here Odin has pledged his eye, presumably
for supernatural vision or foresight. These wells are thus powerful symbols in
the mythology.

ÚTGARD (OUTER-ENCLOSURE)
Where the giants live.
This term is actually only attested in Snorri Sturluson’s account of Thor’s visit
to Útgarda-Loki, in the Gylfaginning of Snorri’s Edda, but it fits conceptually
with the widely known terms Ásgard (Enclosure-of-the-æsir) and Midgard (Cen
tral-enclosure), the worlds of gods and men, respectively. The name Útgarda
Loki means “Loki-of-the-Útgards (pl.),” and I find attractive the idea that gods
and men live in single spaces, whereas the giants are spread about on the periph
ery of the world. The medieval worldview of our sources conceived of the world
as a round disk, with the ocean all the way around it, and Snorri in fact says in
Gylfaginning that the gods gave land along the beaches of this circular cosmos
for the giants to settle in.
See also Ásgard; Midgard
ÚTGARDA-LOKI (LOKI-OF-THE-ÚTGARDS)
Giant; host, opponent, and deceiver of Thor and companions.
The myth of Thor and his companions’ visit to Útgarda-Loki is told at consider
able length in Snorri’s Gylfaginning, of which it makes up nearly one-sixth. It
may conveniently be divided into three parts: Thor’s visit to the family of Thjálfi
and Röskva, the journey of Thor and his companions in the company of Skry ́mir,
and the events at the hall of Útgarda-Loki. I treat the first part at greater length
in the entry on Thjálfi and here will only repeat that, accompanied by Loki, Thor
visits a human family, and because of a violation concerning Thor’s goats, Thor
acquires his human servants Thjálfi and Röskva.
Thor, Loki, and Thjálfi then set out for Jötunheimar and cross a large body
of water. At night they shelter in an empty hall. After an earthquake they move
into a smaller inner room, and throughout the night, as Thor stands watch, they
hear loud noises. In the morning they learn that the noises were the snoring of a
huge fellow who calls himself Skry ́mir, and that the hall they cowered in was his
glove. They agree to travel together, sharing their provisions. However, Skry ́mir
puts the food in his sack, and Thor is later unable to undo the knot while the big
man sleeps. In a rage Thor strikes Skry ́mir with his hammer, Mjöllnir, but
Skry ́mir merely wakes up and mildly asks whether a leaf has fallen on him.
Twice more in the night Thor bashes Skry ́mir with Mjöllnir. The first time
Skry ́mir asks whether an acorn fell on him, the second time whether it was bird
droppings that had awakened him. In the morning they part ways.
Thor and his companions now come to the hall of Útgarda-Loki, another
huge man, and Útgarda-Loki tells the æsir that no one can stay in the hall who
is not the master of some skill or ability. When Loki claims to be an enormous
302 Norse Mythology



eater, an eating contest is set up between Loki and Logi, a retainer of Útgarda
Loki. Loki eats all the food, but Logi eats all the food and the wooden platter it
was served on. Next Thjálfi, the “swiftest of men,” runs a footrace with Útgarda
Loki’s retainer Hugi. Although Thjálfi loses by less in each of the three heats, he
still loses. Finally, contests are set for Thor. He is to drain a drinking horn but
cannot despite three huge quaffs. He is to lift a cat but can only get one paw off
the ground. Finally, he wrestles with an old woman called Elli and is thrown.
The next morning Útgarda-Loki leads his guests out of the hall and explains
the whole thing. He was Skry ́mir, and he had used magic deceptions on them.
The food bag was bound in iron, and he deflected the three hammer blows onto
the landscape, and the result was three valleys. Then, in the hall, Loki’s oppo
nent Logi was actually fire (the meaning of the noun logi) and Thjálfi’s opponent
Hugi was actually thought (the meaning of the noun hugi). Thor’s drinking horn
was connected to the sea, and his quaffs created low tide; the cat was actually
the Midgard serpent; and Elli was old age (the meaning of the noun elli). Thor
raises the hammer again, but Útgarda-Loki and the hall vanish.
Útgarda-Loki is clearly a giant by ethnicity as well as in stature. Thor and
his companions have set off for Jötunheimar, and Útgardar (Outer-enclosures,
found only here) corresponds nicely to Ásgard, the enclosure of the æsir, and
Midgard, the central enclosure where humans live. But even without these place
names, Útgarda-Loki and his companions could only be giants, because only
giants contest with the gods. And although they appear to win their contests,
they did so only by using magic, and their victories were hollow in that, despite
them, Thor performed cosmogonic acts, creating the tides and three mountain
valleys. Where Thor and his company went wrong was in failing to understand
names as nouns, and linguistic abilities belong primarily to Odin. Indeed, in his
control of magic and in outwitting Thor through language, Útgarda-Loki is a
highly Odinic figure. Why he should bear the name Loki is unclear, but it may
have to do with a demonization of Loki in the later Middle Ages.
Loki taunts Thor with cowering in a glove in Lokasenna, stanza 60, and says
that Thor did not even think himself to be Thor. Furthermore, he taunts Thor
with being unable to open the food pack (stanza 62). Thor does not deny the
charges; he simply threatens to bash Loki with the hammer, and this threat
finally causes Loki to desist. In Hárbardsljód, stanza 26, Odin repeats the accu
sation that Thor forgot who he was while he cowered in a glove, and adds that he
was afraid to sneeze or fart, lest Fjalar should hear; Fjalar is presumably Skry ́mir.
In Book 8 of Gesta Danorum Saxo tells of the voyage of Thorkillus to
Utgarthilocus, a prophet. On the way there is a problem with food, but it is
caused by a lack of fire. Finally Thorkillus and his companions reach Utgarthilo
cus, a smelly bound monster in a dark, snake-infested cave. This Loki appears to
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 303



have more to do with the bound Loki of the Norse-Icelandic tradition than with
Útgarda-Loki.
Much of the discussion of the Útgarda-Loki story has sought for origins to
the east or to the west. Those who have commented on the story itself have
mostly thought that it lacks mythic import. I disagree, since I think the story
shows not only Thor’s creative side and the constant threat he poses to the
giants but also the hierarchical superiority of Odin to Thor in the verbal arena.
At the same time, in the story of the acquisition of Thjálfi and Röskva, Thor
shows a special relationship with humans.

VAFTHRÚDNISMÁL
Eddic poem, “Words of Vafthrúdnir.”
The poem is the third in Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, after Hávamál and
before Grímnismál, and was therefore regarded by the compiler, quite rightly, as
an Odin poem. It is also found from stanza 20 onward in the other main manu
script of eddic poetry, AM 748, and Snorri Sturluson quotes many of its stanzas
in Gylfaginning in his Edda. The meter is ljóƒaháttr throughout, with a few
stanzas expanded to galdralag, and the structure appears to be very carefully
thought out.
The first four stanzas comprise a dialogue between Odin and Frigg in which
Odin announces his intention to visit Vafthrúdnir. Frigg tries to dissuade him,
because Vafthrúdnir is wisest of all giants, but when Odin persists, she sends
him off with wishes for a safe return. Stanza 5 describes his journey and is the
only stanza not spoken by one of the actors in the poem. Stanzas 6–9 comprise
304 Norse Mythology



an introductory dialogue between Odin and the giant, and in stanza 10 Odin (or
the narrator?) speaks a gnomic stanza reminiscent of the gnomic stanzas of
Hávamál. In stanzas 11–18, Vafthrúdnir puts four questions, and Odin answers
them: What horse pulls Day (Skínfaxi), what horse pulls Night (Hrímfaxi), what
river separates gods and giants (Ifing), and what plain is marked off for the battle
between Surt and the gods (Vígríd; it is 100 leagues square). Odin’s answers sat
isfy the giant, and he invites Odin into the hall for a contest on which their lives
will depend (stanza 19). The remainder of the poem, stanzas 20–55, consists of
18 questions put by Odin, 17 of which Vafthrúdnir answers.
The first 12 questions are numbered (“Say first, Vafthrúdnir”), and the first
nine are further joined by Odin repeating some version of “since people say you
are wise and you know” before actually putting the question. Odin’s first nine
questions concern cosmogony:
1. Whence came the earth? From the body of Ymir.
2. Whence came the moon and sun? They are the children of Mundil
fœri, who traverse the heavens for human time reckoning.
3. Whence come day and night with its waning moons? Their parents are
Delling and Nör; the gods created them so that people could reckon
time.
4. Whence come summer and winter? Their parents are Vindsval and
Svásud.
5. Who is the oldest of the æsir or of the giants? Bergelmir, whose father
was Thrúdgelmir and grandfather Aurgelmir.
6. Whence came Aurgelmir? From drops of poison out of the Élivágar.
7. How did Aurgelmir beget children? A boy and girl came from under
his arm, and one leg begat a six-headed son on the other.
8. What is the first thing you remember? When Bergelmir was placed on
a lúƒr (according to Snorri, something that floated and saved him from
the flood created from Ymir’s blood).
9. Whence comes the wind? From the giant Hræsvelg, who sits in the
form of an eagle at the end of heaven and flaps his wings.
These items are known from other accounts of the creation and structure of
the universe. It is, however, worth noting that Vafthrúdnir had also asked about
the sun and moon; Odin’s questions elicit a response that concedes the role of
the gods in ordering time. Odin also elicits the monstrous reproductive acts of
the proto-giant, and he ends this sequence by pointing out the location—would
exile be the right word?—of a giant to the end of the universe. Gods and men
occupy the center.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 305



Questions 10–12 are still numbered, but now instead of saying “since people
say you are wise and you know,” Odin says “since you know about the fates of
the gods,” that is, about Ragnarök, and the focus shifts from cosmogony and cos
mology to the end of the world and its aftermath:
10. Whence came Njörd? From the vanir, to whom he will return when
the end comes.
11. Where do people engage in daily battle? All the einherjar do battle on
Odin’s landholdings.
12. How do you know about the runes (here perhaps secrets) of the giants
and of all the gods? I have been to nine worlds below Hel.
This last question is put in the galdralag meter, and the giant rises to the
challenge and responds in the same meter.
Now Odin stops numbering and prefaces each of the remaining questions
with the refrain “Much have I traveled, much tried, much tested the powers”:
13. Who will survive Fimbulvetr? Líf and Lífthrasir.
14. Whence will come the sun again, after Fenrir has overtaken it? Her
daughter will ride the paths of her mother.
15. Who are those wise maidens who travel over the sea? Vafthrúdnir’s
answer to this unclear question is unclear.
16. Which æsir will control the possessions of the gods after Ragnarök?
Vídar and Váli, Magni and Módi.
17. What will happen to Odin? He will be killed by the wolf but avenged
by Vídar.
18. What did Odin himself say, before Baldr was placed on the funeral
pyre, into the ear of his son?
Only Odin knows the answer to this last question, and the giant must yield.
“With a doomed mouth,” he says, “I spoke my old lore and of Ragnarök. With
Odin I was now exchanging my verbal wisdom; you are always the wisest of
beings.”
Just as Thor defeats Hrungnir, the strongest of giants, in a formal duel, so
Odin defeats Vafthrúdnir, the wisest of giants, in a formal verbal duel. Vafthrúd
nir’s four questions to Odin involved cosmogony, cosmology (Ifing), and Rag
narök. Odin’s questions to the giant treat the same issues, at greater length and
more adroitly. The changing introductions to the questions are especially effec
tive, and the revelation of Odin’s identity in the last question only confirms
what is hinted at by the ominous refrain “Much have I traveled,” which Odin
306 Norse Mythology



begins to use just after Vafthrúdnir has reported his own travels to the worlds
below Hel. With the last question Odin disrupts the linear sequence, for Baldr
died before Ragnarök, and the actual subject of the question is withheld until the
final words: “into the ear of his son.” In leading to an epiphany and the subse
quent death of Odin’s interlocutor, Vafthrúdnismál parallels the poem that fol
lows it, Grímnismál.
What Odin said into the ear of the dead Baldr is the ultimate unknowable.
Accounts of Baldr’s funeral do not include the motif of a last message from Odin,
but the motif is also used to end the riddling sequence in Hervarar saga.

In The Origins of Drama in Scandinavia (Cambridge, England: D. S. Brewer, 1995), 275–280, Terry Gunnell considers it alongside other eddic poems that he thinks could have received dramatic performance.
VÁLASKJÁLF
A hall or abode of the gods.
Grímnismál, stanza 6, tells us of it:
There is a third residence, where the blissful powers
Thatched the hall with silver.
It is called Válaskjálf, where built skillfully for himself
The god in days of yore.
Who “the god” is we do not know. Snorri Sturluson, however, thought that
it was Odin. In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri wrote this, just after
he had mentioned Himinbjörg at the end of Bilröst:
There is yet a great place, called Válaskjálf. Odin owns it. The gods made it and
thatched it with shining silver, and there [in it] is Hlidskjálf.
Hlidskjálf is the high seat on which Odin sits himself when he sees into all
the worlds.
Válaskjálf could mean “Váli’s-bench,” or, if the form should be “Valaskjálf”
(we cannot know), it could mean something like “Bench-of-the-slaughtered-ones.”

Deities, Themes, and Concepts 307



VALHÖLL (CARRION-HALL)
Odin’s hall.
Grímnismál, which lists the various abodes of the gods, takes up Valhöll in
stanza 8:
Gladsheim is the fifth, where the gold bright
Valhöll lies widely situated;
And there Hropt chooses each day
Weapon-dead men.
From this it would appear that Valhöll is a hall, perhaps one of many, at
Gladsheim (Snorri knew Grímnismál, so it is interesting to note that he says
Gladsheim was a temple erected at Idavöll by Alfödr [Odin], with 12 high seats).
Later in Grímnismál, Odin (speaker of the poem) describes Valhöll in more detail:
Five hundred doors and forty,
Think I there are at Valhöll;
Eight hundred einherjar go out of one door,
When they go to fight with the wolf.
That is stanza 23. The following stanza confuses the issue somewhat by
ascribing the same number of rooms to Bilskírnir (the hall of Thor), but stanzas
25 and 26 go back to the hall of Valfödr:
25. Heidrún is the name of the goat, who stands at the hall of Herjafödr [Odin]
And bites from the limbs of Lærad.
She will fill a barrel with the bright mead;
That drink can never run out.
26. Eikthyrnir is the name of a hart, who stands at the hall of Herjafödr [Odin]
And bites from the limbs of Lærad.
Yet from his horns it drips into Hvergelmir,
Thence all waters have their ways.
Thus there appears to be endless mead at Valhöll, and it is at the source of
all waters.
In the Gylfaginning section of his Edda, Snorri Sturluson used these and other
sources to create a vivid picture of Valhöll. At the very onset of the piece, he reads
a skaldic stanza in such a way as to suggest that Valhöll was thatched with shields
of gold. Later he says that the valkyries are to serve there, that the einherjar feast
each day on the flesh of the boar Sæhrímnir and drink the mead provided endlessly
by the goat Heidrún each night after doing battle during the day.
308 Norse Mythology



The tenth-century poems Eiríksmál and Hákonarmál have scenes set in
Valhöll, where Odin and the others await the arrival of the human kings Eirík
Bloodax and Hákon the Good. Valhöll was therefore an important mythological
conception as far back as our written records go.
See also Andhrímnir; Eiríksmál; Eldhrímnir; Hákonarmál; Heidrún, Sæhrímnir References and further reading: For the older scholarship, all of it in German and Scandinavian, see Gustav Neckel’s book Walhall: Studien über germanischen Jenseitsglauben (Dortmund: F. W. Ruhfus, 1913). As the title says, this book is about Germanic conceptions of the hereafter. Accordingly, Neckel tries to sketch a development from the carrion on the battlefield to the mythological conception of a hall of the dead presided over by Odin. A charming article by Magnus Olsen, “Valhall med de mange dører,” Acta Philologica Scandinavica 6 (1931–1932): 157–170, imagines that the multiple doors of Valhöll were influenced by Roman amphitheaters, especially the Coliseum. Edith Marold, “Das Walhallbild in den Eiríksmál und Hákonarmál,” Mediaeval Scandinavia 5 (1972): 19–33, acknowledges that the portrait of Valhöll in Hákonarmál is darker and conceivably more archaic than that of Eiríksmál and analyzes especially the duality of the conceptions in Hákonarmál.
VÁLI, SON OF LOKI
Used by the gods in their vengeance on Loki for his role in the death of Baldr.
Snorri tells the story in Gylfaginning: After the gods have captured Loki, they
turn his son Váli into a wolf, and the wolf tears apart his brother Nari or Narfi.
The gods bind Loki with the guts of his dead son (and what happens thereafter
to Váli is left unstated). The prose colophon to Lokasenna in Codex Regius of
the Poetic Edda has the same story, but there the brothers are called Narfi (who
changes into a wolf) and Nari (the source of the guts). Snorri may have been
influenced by something like Völuspá, stanza 34, a half-stanza that is found only
in the Hauksbók redaction of the poem:
Then for [or of] Váli one could turn the killing-bonds;
Quite hard were the fetters, out of guts.
Because the Hauksbók Völuspá lacks the Baldr story, however, this stanza
appears to connect whatever happened to or for Váli to the aftermath of the
battle between the æsir and vanir.
The story as Snorri presents it offers an act of vengeance fitting to the orig
inal crime. Loki makes Höd kill his half brother, Baldr; the gods make Váli kill
his brother (half brother or not, we cannot tell). Both are under a kind of com
pulsion, Höd because he is tricked, Váli because he is transformed into a raven
ing beast. In keeping with this contrast, Höd kills Baldr at a place of sanctuary,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 309



whereas Váli kills Narfi in a wretched cave far from anywhere. And the fathers
too are in contrast: Odin is free awaiting Ragnarök, whereas Loki is bound.
See also Baldr; Loki; Nari and/or Narfi; Váli, Son of Odin
VÁLI, SON OF ODIN
Avenger of Baldr; with his brother Vídar, a survivor of Ragnarök.
Only one eddic poem states explicitly that it was Váli who avenged the death of
Baldr, namely Hyndluljód, stanza 29, the first stanza of the “Short Völuspá.”
Eleven æsir were enumerated,
Baldr who fell by the slayer’s mound [the half-line is obscure];
This Váli declared himself worthy to avenge;
His brother’s killer he slew.
The word for “killer” in the last line is handbani, that is, the one whose hand
actually strikes the blow, as opposed to the ráƒbani, “conspirator to murder.” Thus
we know that Váli’s vengeance was taken on Höd, not on Loki. Baldrs draumar,
stanza 11, and Völuspá, stanza 33, say,
Rind will bear Váli in the western halls,
That son of Odin will kill at the age of one night;
He will not wash his hands or comb his head,
Until he puts on the funeral pyre Baldr’s adversary.
(It should be noted that, following virtually every editor, I have inserted the
name “Váli” in the first line; there is no word at that point, but the line is defec
tive and requires a name or noun beginning with v- because of the demand for
alliteration.) Here we learn that Rind is Váli’s mother, a motif that is corrobo
rated by Snorri in his catalog of the æsir in Gylfaginning: “Áli or Váli is the name
of one, the son of Odin and Rind; he is bold in battle and an extremely fortunate
shot.” This occurs in the catalog just after Vídar, with whom Váli is often paired,
has been mentioned and before Ull is listed. In his Sigurdurdrápa, composed
around 960 if the stanza is genuine, the Icelandic skald Kormák Ögmundarson
says that Odin used magic (seid) on Rind, presumably to beget Váli.
Váli’s extreme youth and absence of grooming are described in virtually
identical language in Völuspá, stanzas 32–33, although the avenger is there just
called “Baldr’s brother.” Váli’s precocious age at the moment he takes vengeance
finds its closest parallel in the story of Thor’s duel with Hrungnir, in which
Thor’s three-year-old (according to one manuscript, three-night-old) son comes
along after the duel and lifts the dead giant’s vast leg off Thor, who is pinned
310 Norse Mythology



helpless beneath it. But the abstention from grooming until vengeance is taken
may be more significant. Váli is regularly paired with Vídar, the “silent god,”
who will avenge his father Odin at Ragnarök; Vídar’s silence looks rather like a
parallel act of abstention. Tacitus, Germania, chapter 31, says of the Chatti, a
Germanic tribe, that novice warriors may not shave or groom themselves until
they have first slain an enemy.
With Vídar, and with the other pairs Magni and Módi, sons of Thor, and
Baldr and Höd, victim and killer, Váli will survive Ragnarök. Vafthrúdnismál,
stanza 51, is the best source:
Vídar and Váli will inhabit the holy places of the gods,
When Surt’s fire dies down;
Módi and Magni will have Mjöllnir
And will bring about a cessation of killing.
Snorri is, as usual, more explicit. Vídar and Váli survive because neither fire
nor the sea can harm them, and with the other surviving gods they inhabit Idavöll,
where Ásgard once was, and retain artifacts and memories of their forebears.
The name Váli is understood as deriving from a form meaning “Little
member-of-the-vanir,” but Váli has nothing to do with the vanir, and the alter
native “Little-warrior” makes more sense. Snorri’s alternate name, Áli, is
unexplained, except as a supposed derivation from Váli. In Saxo’s version of the
Baldr story, the avenger of Balderus is Bous, son of Othinus and Rinda. The
names Váli and Bous are not related.
See also Baldr; Bous; Idavöll; Rind; Váli, Son of Loki; Vídar References and further reading: Heinrich Wagner, “Eine-irisch-altnordische hieros gamos-Episode,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur 77 (1955), 348–357, argues that the siring of Váli/Bous is a divine marriage, with a parallel in Irish tradition.
VANIR
Subgroup of the gods.
The vanir are distinguished from the æsir, the dominant group to which Odin
and Thor and their consorts belong, but they are also subsumed within it, so that
the word æsir generally refers to both groups. The word vanir is related etymo
logically to the word for “friend” in the Scandinavian languages and to words in
other languages meaning “pleasure” or “desire.” The vanir joined the æsir as a
result of a war between the two groups. The deities explicitly referred to as vanir
are Njörd, Frey, Freyja, and possibly Heimdall. Njörd is the father of Frey and
Freyja, with his sister, according to Snorri in Ynglinga saga, because that was the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 311



custom among the vanir. But among the æsir such incestuous liaisons were not
permitted, and they therefore ended with the incorporation of the two groups of
gods. Scholars generally think of the vanir as gods of fertility, perhaps especially
because Frey’s major moment in the mythology involves a marriage to the giant
ess Gerd. But a poetic formula refers to the “wise vanir,” and Thrymskvida,
stanza 15, says that Heimdall can see the future, “like other vanir.”
See also Æsir-Vanir War; Frey; Freyja; Heimdall; Njörd
VÁR
Minor goddess.
Snorri lists Vár ninth in his catalog in Gylfaginning of goddesses among the æsir
and says this about her: “She gives a hearing to the oaths of people and the per
sonal agreements that men and women grant one another; thus those agree
ments are called várar [pl.]. She takes vengeance on those who violate them.”
The noun várar does turn up a few times in references to pledges, especially of a
marital nature, but Vár is unknown outside of Snorri’s list of goddesses.
VEDRFÖLNIR (STORM-PALE)
Hawk associated with Yggdrasil, the world tree.
This figure is found only in Snorri Sturluson’s Gylfaginning. Describing
Yggdrasil, the world tree, he says,
A certain eagle sits in the limbs of the ash, and it knows a great deal, and
between its eyes sits that hawk who is called Vedrfölnir.
Why a hawk should sit between the eyes of an eagle, or what its role might
be, Snorri leaves unaddressed. Presumably the hawk is associated with the wis
dom of the eagle. Perhaps, like Odin’s ravens, it flies off acquiring and bringing
back knowledge.
See also Yggdrasil
VÍDAR
God; sometimes called the “silent god;” associated especially with vengeance.
Snorri includes Vídar in his catalog of the æsir in Gylfaginning, after Höd and
before Áli/Váli. Here Snorri says that Vídar is the silent god, that he has a thick
shoe, that he is second in might only to Thor, and that the gods have great sup
port or consolation from him in all struggles. In Skáldskaparmál Snorri places
312 Norse Mythology



Vídar among the other æsir at the banquet of Ægir and tells us that we may use
these kennings for Vídar: “the silent god,” “the owner of the iron shoe,” “enemy
and killer of the Fenris wolf [Fenrir],” “the vengeance god [áss] of the gods
[goƒ],” “the dwelling god [áss] of paternal properties,” “the son of Odin” and
“brother of the æsir.” In his account of Thor’s journey to Geirröd in Skáldskap
armál, Snorri says that the giantess Gríd, who equips Thor with various pieces
of equipment, is the mother of Vídar the silent.
In his vision of the dwellings of the gods in Grímnismál, Odin describes
Vídar’s “land” last, in stanza 17, and says it is grown with brushwood and tall
grass:
There the son gets off the back of a mare,
The brave one, to avenge his father.
Vídar’s silence is unexplained in the texts that have come down to us. Some
scholars believe it may derive from ritual silences or other abstentions accom
panying acts of vengeance; Baldr’s brother, presumably Váli, does not wash his
hands or comb his hair until he has laid Baldr’s adversary on the funeral pyre
(Völuspá, stanza 33, and Baldrs draumar, stanza 11). As for the shoe, it is defi
nitely associated with vengeance, for Vídar uses his shoe, according to Snorri, to
take vengeance on the wolf Fenrir for killing Odin (who is his father, according
to Völuspá, stanza 56). Just after Snorri has the wolf swallow Odin, he writes
this:
Immediately thereafter Vídar will come forth and put one foot on the lower jaw
of the wolf. On that foot he will have that shoe, which has been put together for
all time; it is the leather scraps that people cut out of their shoes by the toes and
heel, and therefore a person who wishes to take care to help the æsir shall throw
away the leather scraps. With one hand he takes hold of the upper jaw of the
wolf and tears apart his gullet, and that will be the death of the wolf.
This shoe is otherwise unknown; tentative identifications of Vídar on the
stone crosses at Gosforth, Northumbria, and Kirk Andreas, Isle of Man, do not,
as far as I can see, show any special footwear. The issue is further complicated
by the existence of an alternative version of Vídar’s killing of Fenrir with a
sword, in Völuspá, stanza 56:
Then comes the great son of Sigfather [Odin];
Vídar, to fight with the beast of battle;
For the son of Hvedrung, he makes stand with his hand
A sword in the heart; thus the father is avenged.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 313



Hvedrung is surely Loki, since Ynglinga tal, stanza 32, refers to Hel as Hve
drung’s daughter. The name is also to be found among the thulur as a word for
giant, and, confusingly, as an Odin name.
The account in Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 53, is perhaps equivocal on the
method the vengeance took. Odin has just asked Vafthrúdnir about Odin’s fate:
The wolf will swallow Aldafödr [Odin]
Vídar will avenge this;
The malevolent jaws he will cleave
At the death of the wolf.
The verb “cleave” looks as though it should refer to something done with a
sword, but it is just possible that one could imagine tearing a beast apart by its
jaws to be an act of cleaving. It is of course not impossible that Snorri introduced
this interpretation.
Vídar’s major act in the mythology, then, is one of vengeance. In this he is
like Váli, the avenger of Baldr, and we may speculate that there may once have
been a story about Odin’s seduction or rape of Gríd, just as there exists one about
his getting Váli on Rind (Bous on Rinda in Saxo). Vídar and Váli are linked not
only by acts of vengeance, and by alliteration, but also by virtue of surviving
Ragnarök and inhabiting the new world that is to exist. Vafthrudnismál, stanza
51, is the best source:
Vídar and Váli will inhabit the holy places of the gods,
When Surt’s fire dies down;
Módi and Magni will have Mjöllnir
And will bring about a cessation of killing.
Snorri is, as usual, more explicit. Vídar and Váli survive because neither fire
nor the sea can harm them, and with the other surviving gods they inhabit Idavöll,
where Ásgard once was, and retain artifacts and memories of their forebears.
According to Georges Dumézil, Vídar was a cosmic figure derived from an
Indo-European archetype. He was aligned with both vertical space (from his foot
on the wolf’s lower jaw to his hand on the upper jaw) and horizontal space (by
means of his step and strong shoe) and therefore served to define the boundaries
of space, just as Heimdall defined the boundaries of time. By killing the wolf,
Vídar keeps it from destroying the cosmos, which can then be restored in the
aftermath of Ragnarök.

VÍDBLÁIN (WIDE-BLUED)
Third heaven, according to Snorri’s Gylfaginning.
There are no other mentions of this place in the mythology. When Snorri men
tions it, he adds that the light-elves live there now.
See also Andlang
VÍDBLINDI (WIDE-BLIND)
Giant used in kennings.
The kenning “boar of Vídblindi” in a verse by the poet Hallar-Steinn is explained
by Snorri in Skáldskaparmál as follows:
Here whales are called the “boars of Vídblindi.” He was a giant and fished up
whales at sea like fishes.
An anonymous verse from the thirteenth century appears to call whales
“pigs of Vídblindi,” and Vídblindi is numbered among the giants in the thulur.
He appears to be one of those figures preserved in the verse tradition but not in
the mythology.
VIDFINN (WOOD-FINN)
Father of the children who accompany the moon, according to Snorri Sturluson.
These children are Bil and Hjúki, who according to Gylfaginning were taken up
from earth as they were walking. Although Anne Holtsmark has explained him
as the Man in the Moon, what I find most interesting about him is that he is
assigned Finnish (in this context almost certainly Sámi) ethnicity. I assume that
this assignment has to do with the distance of the moon from the earth and per
haps also with a notion of the moon as a treeless, inhospitable landscape rather
like the mountains of Norway.
Some have read the name as “Contrary-Finn” or “Finder,” but “Wood-Finn”
is, as far as I can tell, the standard reading.

VILI AND VÉ
Odin’s brothers.
Like Odin, Vili and Vé are the sons of Bur; according to Völuspá, stanza 4, they
raised the earth and shaped Midgard, and according to the Gylfaginning section
of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda, they endowed the first humans with life.
According to Snorri in Ynglinga saga, once when Odin had been away on a
journey for a particularly long time, Odin’s brothers, Vili and Vé, divided his
inheritance and both possessed Frigg, but Odin later returned and took her back.
Saxo Grammaticus tells a somewhat similar story in Book 1 of the Gesta Dano
rum: In order to adorn herself with gold, Frigga despoils a statue of Othinus and
then gives herself to a servant in order to enlist his aid in taking down the statue.
In shame Othinus goes into self-imposed exile, and during his exile a sorcerer
called Mithothyn takes his place and institutes a change in cult procedures. Upon
Othinus’s return, Mithothyn flees to Fyn and is killed by the inhabitants there.
Loki knew a version of this story and was not above reminding Frigg about
it. In Lokasenna, stanza 26, when Frigg tries to silence Loki, he rebukes her:
Shut up, Frigg! You are Fjörgyn’s daughter
and have ever been most eager for men,
when Vé and Vili you allowed, wife of Vidrir,
to embrace you.

VINGÓLF (FRIEND-HALL)
Hall at Ásgard.
Vingólf is known only from Snorri Sturluson, who mentions it twice in the
Gylfaginning section of his Edda. First he says it is a temple near Gladsheim, a
truly beautiful building tended by priestesses. Later he says that for all who fall
in battle—the einherjar—Odin arranges a place at Valhöll or Vingólf. It is not
impossible to reconcile these notions, especially if we see the valkyries serving
beer at Valhöll as analogous to the priestesses at Vingólf.
See also Einherjar; Valhöll
VÖLUND
Hero, main subject of the eddic poem Völundarkvida.
Although he is once called “countryman of elves” in the poem, and twice
“prince of elves,” no direct connection with elves is to be seen. Völund appears
to be the Scandinavian reflex of Wayland the Smith, who is well known in
316 Norse Mythology



English tradition. In Thidriks saga, which either reflects German tradition or is
a direct translation of a German book, the character Velent, the son of a giant
and a mermaid, is apprenticed to dwarfs, and subsequently, like Völund, he is
captured and maimed and exacts a terrible vengeance.

VÖLUSPÁ
Eddic poem, “Prophecy [spá] of the Seeress [völva].”
Völuspá is the first poem in Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, either because its
synopsis of the mythology, from the creation to the destruction of the cosmos to
its rebirth, invited the compiler to place it there, or because the compiler thought
of it as one of the Odin poems, which he had elected to place at the beginning of
the collection (or for both reasons). A separate version of the poem exists in Hauks
bók, a manuscript comprising what is in effect the private library—a collection of
historical, religious, and scientific texts—of Hauk Erlendsson, an Icelandic law
man who spent the last years of his life in Norway. The version of Völuspá in this
manuscript is written in an Icelandic hand from the middle of the fourteenth cen
tury and thus may have been added to it after Hauk’s death in 1334. Besides these
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 317

two full versions of the poem, Snorri Sturluson quotes numerous stanzas in the
Gylfaginning of his Edda, some of them differing slightly in wording from the
Codex Regius or Hauksbók versions. Some scholars therefore operate with the
concept of a third version, perhaps oral, that Snorri used, and certainly Snorri can
not have had either of the other versions before him when he wrote.
Völuspá is spoken by a seeress under the compulsion of Valfödr (stanza 1) or
Odin. She refers to herself sometimes in the first and sometimes in the third per
son. She remembers those giants who raised her (stanza 2), before the world had
been created (3). The sons of Bur raised up the earth (4), and the gods created time
reckoning (5–6), had tools (7), and enjoyed gold until three giant maidens dis
rupted their joy (8). Upon the counsel of the gods (9), Mótsognir was made the
mightiest of dwarfs, and the dwarfs made human images out of earth (10). A cat
alog of dwarfs occupies the next several stanzas, with somewhat differing ver
sions in the various redactions of the poem. The æsir endowed Ask and Embla
with life forces (stanzas 17–18). At this point the poem turns from cosmogony to
cosmology and describes the world tree and the norns (19–20, 27–28). The Æsir
Vanir War occupies stanzas 21–24, and 25–26 may allude to the building of the
wall at Ásgard. In the Codex Regius, but not in Hauksbók, there follows the
story of Baldr’s death and the aftermath of that climactic event (30–35). There
follows a description of the moral and cosmic disintegration that characterized
Ragnarök, and then the deaths of the gods and the demise of the cosmos itself
(57). The last stanzas, however, strike a hopeful note. The seeress sees the earth
arise for a second time (59). The æsir—presumably a new generation of them
will assemble, and they will find physical and narrative links to their past
(60–61). Unsown fields will grow, and Baldr and Höd will dwell together, pre
sumably reconciled. Ritual activity will be resumed. A stanza to be found only
in Hauksbók reports that “the powerful one will come from on high, he who
rules all.” But a dragon will also come flying, with corpses in its grip. Now, the
seeress says, “she must sink,” and the poem ends.
The lack of Baldr’s death in the Hauksbók redaction is the major difference
between it and the Codex Regius version, and it is a significant difference. In
Codex Regius the onset of Ragnarök follows immediately after and appears to be
a direct result of Baldr’s death. In the Hauksbók text, on the other hand, Rag
narök seems somewhat unmotivated. But the Hauksbók text sends to earth “the
powerful one, he who rules all,” which looks much like an intrusion of the
Christian god. Indeed, even without this stanza, there is much in the poem that
is reminiscent of Christianity, and in part because it seems to indulge in mil
lennial thinking, scholars have been inclined to date it to the last decades of the
tenth century. This dating is uncertain, and attempts to assign the poem’s origin
to a specific location are even more uncertain.
318 Norse Mythology



Völuspá is one of the most powerful and eloquent monuments of Scandina
vian mythology, with a beauty of expression that is seldom matched and an
overarching view of the mythology that is also peerless. Snorri’s otherwise elo
quent summary of the mythology in Gylfaginning owes much to Völuspá but
seems clumsy when set alongside it.

and says this about her: “She too is wise and so questioning that no item may be
concealed from her. It is a proverb that a woman becomes vör [aware] of that
when she becomes wise.” The name Vör is nothing more than the feminine form
of the common adjective varr, “aware.” This goddess is completely unknown
outside of Snorri’s catalog, but her name occurs twice as the base word in
woman kennings in skaldic poetry.
YGGDRASIL (YGG’S-STEED)
The world tree, located at the center of the universe and uniting it.
The seeress who is the speaker in Völuspá devotes a stanza to the tree, stanza 19
in the usual editions:
I know an ash tree that stands, called Yggdrasil,
A tall tree, sprinkled with white mud;
Thence come the dews that run into valleys,
Forever it stands green over the Urdarbrunn.
Grímnismál has a good deal of information about Yggdrasil, all of it, accord
ing to the conceit of the poem, spoken by Odin as a kind of vision of holy cos
mography. Stanza 44 calls it the “best of trees.” Stanzas 29–30 say that the æsir
go to the ash of Yggdrasil each day “to judge.” Thor goes on foot and the other
æsir on horses that are listed in stanza 30; of the ten horse names listed, only one
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 319



is elsewhere associated with a specific god (Gulltopp, which Snorri says is Heim
dall’s horse). Stanza 29 implies that the Ás-Brú, the bridge of the æsir usually
called Bilröst or Bifröst, leads to the tree.
The next five stanzas are about the tree itself:
31. Three roots stand on three roads
From under the ash of Yggdrasil;
Hel lives under one, under another the frost giants,
Human beings under a third.
32. Ratatosk is the name of a squirrel who shall run
on the ash of Yggdrasil;
words of an eagle he shall carry down
and say to Nídhögg below.
33. There are four harts who with necks bent back
gnaw on the buds:
Dáin and Dvalin,
Duneyr and Durathrór.
34. Many snakes lie under the ash of Yggdrasil,
and may every witless person consider that;
Góinn and Móinn,—they are the sons of Grafvitnir—,
Grábak and Grafvöllud;
Ofnir and Sváfnir, I think will ever
Eat the branches of the tree.
35. The ash of Yggdrasil suffers difficulty,
more than men may know;
a hart bites from below, yet on the side it rots;
Nídhögg harms it from below.
Beset as the tree is according to this account, it will shake and tremble at
Ragnarök, according to Völuspá, stanza 47, which refers to it as “the aged tree.”
Snorri uses and adapts these stanzas (Yggdrasil is not mentioned in other
sources) to create a unified description of the tree in Gylfaginning, a description
that includes information and conceptions not in the eddic poetry. The capital
or holy place of the gods is at the ash of Yggdrasil, where the gods pass judgments
each day:
The ash is the greatest and best of all trees. Its limbs stretch over the entire
world and rise above heaven. Three roots of the tree hold it up and stretch out
widely. One is among the æsir, the second among the frost giants, where Gin
nunga gap used to be, the third stands over Niflheim. Under that root is
Hvergelmir, and Nídhögg gnaws the roots from below. Under that root which
turns toward the frost giants is the Mímisbrunn. . . . The third root [i.e., the first
320 Norse Mythology



one] of the ash stands in heaven and under that root is that well which is very
holy and is called the Urdarbrunn; there the gods have their place of judgment.
Each day the æsir ride up there on Bilröst.
Later Gylfi/Gangleri asks whether there is more to say about the tree. Hár
responds:
There is much to tell about it. A certain eagle sits in the limbs of the ash, and
it knows a great deal, and between its eyes sits that hawk who is called Vedr
fölnir. That squirrel which is called Ratatosk runs up and down the ash and car
ries malicious words between the eagle and Nídhögg, and four harts run in the
limbs of the ash and bite the needles. . . . And there are so many snakes in
Hvergelmir with Nídhögg that no one can count them.
Finally, Snorri quotes a variant of the verse from Völuspá with which I
began this entry:
I know a besprinkled ash called Yggdrasil
A tall tree, holy with white mud.
Thence come the dews, which run into the valley;
It stands ever green over the Urdarbrunn.
Snorri thus somewhat extends the unifying principle of the tree by allowing
it to tower over earth and sky, and he moves it from the world of humans sug
gested by the location of the roots in Grímnismál (humans, giants, and the dead)
to the mythological plane (æsir, giants, the underworld). He clarifies the role of
the squirrel and eagle, turning the drama that is played out on the tree by these
creatures into a duel of words like the ones at which Odin so excels, and he
explicitly identifies Nídhögg as a snake or dragon. Unfortunately, he fails to
explain the white mud, and that has remained an unsolved mystery.
According to Hávamál, stanza 138, Odin hung himself on a wide windy tree
with mysterious roots, in a self-sacrifice that led to an acquisition of wisdom.
Nearly everyone thinks this tree must be the world tree, and if so, the name
Yggdrasil would refer to this myth: Ygg is an Odin name, and the hanged “ride”
the gallows. Certainly Odin has a close connection with the tree, and it has even
been suggested that he was born from the tree, that is, that the tree is identical
with Bestla, Odin’s mother.
The tree functions on both the vertical axis (trunk) and the horizontal axis
(roots), and structural readings of the mythology, such as those of Eleazar
Meletinskij, have suggested that these have varying functions: wisdom on the
vertical axis and history on the horizontal axis. And the tree brings not just spa
tial unity to the mythology; Gro Steinsland showed elegantly through an analy
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 321



sis of Völuspá how it also brought chronological unity. Stanza 2 implies its pres
ence in seed; it moves to a symbol of completed creation (stanza 19), gathering
place of the gods (27), ancillary to Baldr’s death (31), shaking symbol of the
imminent demise of the cosmos (46–47), and finally, in the wooden lots chosen
by Hœnir (stanza 63) after Ragnarök, it is the symbol of the new world.
In his description of the pagan temple at Old Uppsala written around 1070,
Adam of Bremen says that a large yew tree stands in front of the temple and that
it is from the branches of this tree that sacrificial victims are hung. The con
nection with Yggdrasil is obvious: a large tree at the center of the religious land
scape. The concept of a “world tree” is widespread in Eurasia, and where
shamanism is used the tree is often the path taken by the shaman into the
worlds of the spirits.
See also Bestla; Nídhögg, Ratatosk References and further reading: A good general discussion of the tree in English is that of Hilda Ellis Davidson, “Scandinavian Cosmology,” in Ancient Cosmologies, ed. Carmen Blacker and Michael Loewe (London: Allen and Unwin, 1975), 172–197. Meletinskij’s structural analysis of the mythology is to be found in “Scandinavian Mythology as a System,” Journal of Symbolic Anthropology 1 (1973): 43–58 and 2 (1974): 57–78; see also Margaret Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Icelandic Society, vol. 1: The Myths (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), 50–55.

YMIR
The proto-giant killed and dismembered by the gods to create the cosmos.
In Vafthrúdnismál, after the wise giant Vafthrúdnir has asked Odin a series of
questions, Odin begins to query the giant. His first question is “Whence first
came the earth / or heaven above?” Vafthrúdnir responds in stanza 21:
Out of Ymir’s flesh the earth was formed,
And out of his bones the mountains,
Heaven from the skull of the frost cold giant,
And from his “sweat” [blood] the sea.
This stanza is repeated with variations and expansions in Grímnismál, stan
zas 40–41:
40. Out of Ymir’s flesh the earth was formed,
And from his “sweat” [blood] the sea.
322 Norse Mythology



Mountains from bones, the tree from hair,
And from his skull, heaven.
41. And from his brows the blithe gods made
Midgard for the sons of men;
And from his brain the tough-minded clouds
Were all formed.
In stanza 28 of Vafthrúdnismál, Odin asks Vafthrúdnir who the “oldest of
the æsir / or of the kinsmen of Ymir / might have been in days of yore,” and
although the response cites Bergelmir, Thrúdgelmir, and Aurgelmir, the ques
tion implies that Ymir was very ancient. That implication is supported by
Völuspá, stanza 3:
That was long ago, when Ymir lived,
There was no sand nor sea nor cool waves;
The earth did not exist nor heaven above,
A gap was gaping, nor was there grass.
The following stanza says that the sons of Bur raised lands; they were “the
ones who created famous Midgard.”
Pagan skalds used kennings such as “Ymir’s skull” for heaven or “Ymir’s
blood” for the sea, so the notion of Ymir as the raw material of the cosmos is
assuredly old. The role of the gods in it, although perhaps implied by Völuspá, is
made explicit only by Snorri Sturluson in Gylfaginning. But Snorri actually has
several important things to say about Ymir, and the first of these is his role as
proto-giant and progenitor of the race of giants (as Hyndluljód, stanza 33 puts it,
all the giants come from Ymir).
In Snorri’s version of cosmogony, fundamental oppositions of hot and cold
met in Ginnunga gap, and drops of moisture were the result.
And from those drops of poison life emerged, with the power that the heat sent,
and it grew into a human form, and that one is called Ymir, but the frost giants
call him Aurgelmir, and all the families of frost giants descend from him.
Gangleri asks whether this Ymir is some kind of god, and Hár responds:
In no way do we acknowledge him to be a god; he was evil and all his descen
dants. We call them frost giants. And it is said that when he slept, he broke into
a sweat, and then there grew under his left arm a man and a woman, and one
leg got a son on the other, and from them come the descendants, that is, the
frost giants. And the old frost giant, we call him Ymir.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 323



Snorri appears to be making an effort here to harmonize the notion of Ymir
as the proto-giant with stanzas 30–33 of Vafthrúdnismál, in which Aurgelmir is
said to have engaged in the monstrous hermaphroditic procreation that Snorri
assigns to Ymir. This form of conceiving and bearing offspring is distant from
anything that observation of humans or animals could suggest, and although it
is not at all uncommon in cosmogonies for hermaphroditic conception and birth
to occur, in the context of this mythology it demonstrates once and for all the
alien nature of the giants, Ymir’s descendants.
Ymir’s relationship with the æsir is Snorri’s next topic. Also formed out of
drops in Ginnunga gap was Audhumla, the proto-cow. Her milk fed Ymir, and
she licked Búri, the first of the æsir, out of the salt blocks. Búri sired a son Bor
(presumably in the normal way), and Bor married Bestla, the daughter of the
giant Bölthorn and therefore a descendant of Ymir. The number of generations is
so small that it is tempting to imagine that Bölthorn was one of those who
emerged directly from Ymir, but no source makes that explicit.
The sons of Bor, according to Snorri, were Odin, Vili, and Vé, and they cre
ated the world. Here is Snorri’s account:
The sons of Bor killed Ymir the giant. And when he fell, so much blood gushed
from his wounds, that with it all of the frost giants were killed, except one got
away with his family. The giants called that one Bergelmir. He got up on his
lúƒr along with his wife and saved himself there, and from them come the fam
ilies of the frost giants.
Here again Snorri is striving for consistency with Vafthrúdnismál. In
Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 35, Vafthrúdnir says simply that the oldest thing he
remembers was when Bergelmir was placed on a lúƒr. Snorri clearly understood
the lúƒr as something that would float, and the word might in fact have meant
“coffin” or “chest” or some wooden part of a mill; the expected meaning, of a
cumbersome musical instrument something like an alphorn, makes no sense
either in Snorri or his poetic source. In Vafthrúdnismál, Bergelmir could have
been placed in his coffin or on some plank of wood, which would suggest his
funeral, or perhaps into a cradle at birth. In neither case is there any reason to
think of a flood, but that is what Snorri did, presumably as an analogue to the
Judeo-Christian flood story.
Snorri’s final section about Ymir presents the creation of the cosmos:
They took Ymir and transported him into the middle of Ginnunga gap and made
the earth from him: from his blood the sea and lakes; the earth was made from
the flesh, and mountains from the bones, rocks and gravel from the teeth and
molars and bones that were broken. . . . From that blood that ran out of the
324 Norse Mythology



wounds and was flowing aimlessly, they made that ocean, when they made the
earth and anchored it down, and they put it around the earth, and most people
would find it impossible to cross it. . . . They also took his skull [and] made
from it the heaven and put it up over the earth with four sides, and under each
corner they put a dwarf; they are called East, West, North, and South.
Snorri has the sons of Bor make a medieval cosmos, with the earth in the
center and the sea surrounding it, and he adds the details of the cardinal direc
tions represented by dwarfs holding up the sky. He also adds Ymir’s teeth to the
micro-macro equation.
The slaying of a monster is seen not infrequently in connection with the
creation of the universe in mythologies from all around the world, and the cre
ation of the cosmos through a set of micro-macro analogies is not uncommon
in Indo-European tradition. Ymir’s name originally meant something like
“doubled,” and scholars associate this etymology with the hermaphroditic pro
creation in which he indulges and with Tuisto, the primeval being in Tacitus,
Germania, chapter 2. But perhaps most important for the mythology as a whole,
in my view, is that Ymir is a maternal relative of Bor’s sons, perhaps as close as
their grandfather. To create the cosmos, the gods killed a maternal relative. This
may be seen as the first of three killings within the family in the mythology. The
second is the death of Baldr at the hands of his half brother Höd, and the third
would be the set of killings at Ragnarök, when giants and gods, inextricably
linked through Ymir and Audhumla, kill each other off and destroy the cosmos
that was created through the first killing.
See also Audhumla; Aurgelmir; Baldr; Bergelmir; Bestla; Bur, Bor; Búri; Tuisto References and further reading: A comparative reading of the entire set of creation myths was offered by Franz Rolf Schröder, “Germanische Schöpfungsmythen I–II: Eine vergleichende religionsgeschichtliche Studie,” Germanisch-Romanisch Monatsschrift 19 (1931): 1–26, 81–99 (Ymir is treated in part I). The mysterious lúƒr is the subject of Anne Holtsmark, “Det norrøne ord lúƒr,” Maal og minne, 1946: 49–65. The “doubled” nature of Ymir and identity with Tuisto were argued by Richard M. Meyer, “Beiträge zur altgermanischen Mythologie,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 23 (1907): 245–256, and “Ymi-Tuisto,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 25 (1909): 333. A splendid analysis of the micromacro equation is presented by Bruce Lincoln in his Myth, Cosmos, and Society: Indo-European Themes of Creation and Destruction (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1986).
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 325



YNGVI
Name for Frey, sometimes compounded as Yngvi-Frey.
Poets referred to both the Swedes and Norwegians as “Yngvi’s people,” presum
ably because of the association of King Rögnvald of Vestfold, Norway, with the
Swedish dynasty of the Ynglingar. Yngvi also is used in skaldic poetry, following
the normal rules of diction, as a noun meaning “king.” In the prologue to his
Edda, Snorri said that Odin (this is the euhemerized Odin, the king who emi
grated from Tyrkland to Scandinavia) had a son named Yngvi who succeeded
him as king of Sweden. From him descend the lineages called Ynglingar. But in
his Ynglinga saga Snorri says explicitly that Yngvi was a second name for Frey
(chapter 10), and twice he uses the compound Yngvifrey. Snorri also says that the
name Yngvi was long used in Frey’s lineage as a term of respect. Later, in chap
ter 17, he puts it this way:
Dyggvi was the first of his family to be called king; before that they were called
dróttinn [chieftain], their wives dróttning [chieftain’s wife; later queen], and the
court drótt [warrior band]. But each of their lineage was called Yngvi or Ynguni
his whole life through, and all the Ynglingar together.
The last sentence must use “the Ynglingar” in the sense of a dynasty rather
than a people, and it accords with the poetic usage mentioned above. The form
Ynguni (in some manuscripts Yngunni or Yngvin) is not found elsewhere, but it
looks very like the West Germanic form in Ingunar-Frey.
See also Frey; Ing; Ingunar-Frey

Also see Wolfgang Krause, “Ing,” Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen, phil.-hist.-Kl., 10 (1944):
229–254, for an argument that the name originally meant “man” and was associated with fertility through the sun; Henrik Schück, “Ingunar Frey,” Fornvännen 10 (1940): 289–296, which argued that Ingun was the earth;
Franz Rolf Schröder, Untersuchungen zur germanischen und vergleichenden Religionsgeschichte, vol. 1: Ingunar-Frey (Tübingen: J. C. B. Mohr [P. Siebeck], 1941), which argued for Ingun as a fertility goddess associated with a holy tree.

BACKGROUND—VIKING AND MEDIEVAL SCANDINAVIA
For the Viking Age a number of excellent works exist offering varying treatments:
Else Roesdahl, The Vikings, trans. Susan M. Margeson and Kirsten Williams
327



(New York and London: Penguin Books, 1992; Danish original 1987), presents
a general survey. Roesdahl is an archaeologist, but she is well informed on the
written sources as well, and she offers the most accessible and complete treat
ment currently available. Peter Sawyer, ed., The Oxford Illustrated History of
the Vikings (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), contains a
collection of chapters by various experts on a number of subjects, based on the
latest research. Numerous illustrations enhance the work. R. I. Page, Chroni
cles of the Vikings: Records, Memorials, and Myths (Toronto and Buffalo:
University of Toronto Press, 1995) offers a collection of primary source mate
rials with introductions and commentaries. John Haywood, The Penguin His
torical Atlas of the Vikings (New York and London: Penguin Books, 1995), is
a wonderful collection of maps and includes illustrations in color and apt
commentary.
Of the many older works on the Viking Age, none is encountered more fre
quently than Gwyn Jones, A History of the Vikings, rev. ed. (New York and
London: Oxford University Press, 1984). It is engaging if a bit wordy. Peter
Foote and David M. Wilson, The Achievement of the Vikings: The Society and
Culture of Early Medieval Scandinavia (London: Sidgwick and Jackson, 1970),
is unsurpassed in the detail of its expert coverage. A groundbreaking work was
that of Peter Sawyer, The Age of the Vikings, 2nd ed. (London: E. Arnold, 1971).
David Wilson, The Vikings and Their Origins: Scandinavia in the First Millen
nium (New York: McGraw Hill, 1970), is for the general reader. Johannes
Brøndsted, The Vikings (New York: Penguin, 1965; Danish original 1960), now
seems outmoded.
Larger-format illustrated books include James Graham-Campbell and
Dafydd Kidd, The Vikings (New York: W. Morrow and Co., 1980), the catalog
of an exhibition held at the British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. Published the same year were two similar books: James Graham-Campbell
et al., The Viking World (New Haven and New York: Ticknor and Fields,
1980), and David M. Wilson, ed., The Northern World: The History and Her
itage of Northern Europe AD 400–1100 (New York: H. N. Abrams, 1980), both
perhaps inspired by the exhibition. They all follow in the path of Bertil Alm
gren et al., eds., The Viking (Gothenburg, Sweden: Tre Tryckare, 1967), in
including chapters by various experts and rich illustrations, many in color, on
large pages. And an explicit exhibition catalog is William Fitzhugh and Elisa
beth I. Ward, Vikings: The Norse Atlantic Saga (Washington, DC, and London:
Smithsonian Institution Press, 2000). It focuses on the Viking expansion west
across the Atlantic and is particularly authoritative on the subjects that are
best informed by archaeology. A separate chapter is devoted to religion, art,
and runes.
328 Norse Mythology



Treatments of individual areas abound. For Britain, see H. R. Loyn, The
Vikings in Britain (London: B. T. Batsford, 1977), P. H. Sawyer, From Roman
Britain to Norman England (Methuen, London, 1978), Alfred P. Smyth, Scan
dinavian Kings in the British Isles, 850–880, Oxford Historical Monographs
(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), and Sir Frank Stenton’s standard work,
Anglo-Saxon England, 3rd ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971). For
mainland Scandinavia: Klavs Randsborg, The Viking Age in Denmark: The
Foundation of a State (London: Duckworth, 1980). For Russia and expansion to
the east: E. A. Melnikova, The Eastern World of the Vikings: Eight Essays about
Scandinavia and Eastern Europe in the Early Middle Ages, Gothenburg Old
Norse Studies, 1 (Gothenburg, Sweden: Litteraturvetenskapliga Institutionen,
Göteborgs Universitet, 1996). For Iceland: Jón Jóhannesson, A History of the
Old Icelandic Commonwealth: Íslendinga saga, trans. Haraldur Bessason
([Manitoba:] University of Manitoba Press, 1974). For Greenland: Knud J. Krogh,
Viking Greenland: With a Supplement of Saga Texts ([Copenhagen:] National
Museum, 1967).
The Migration Period is well covered in Lucien Musset, The Germanic Inva
sions: The Making of Europe, AD 400–600, trans. Edward and Columba James
(University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1975), and Malcolm
Todd, The Early Germans, The Peoples of Europe (Oxford and Cambridge, MA:
Blackwell, 1992).
Medieval Scandinavia has attracted far less general attention than the
Viking Age. An exception is Peter Sawyer and Bibi Sawyer, Medieval Scandi
navia: From Conversion to Reformation, circa 800–1500, Nordic Series, 17 (Min
neapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993). Otherwise one should consult
the national histories. For Denmark: Stewart P. Oakley, A Short History of Den
mark (New York: Praeger, 1972). For Iceland: Jón R. Hjalmarsson, History of Ice
land: From the Settlement to the Present Day (Reykjavík: Iceland Review, 1993).
For Norway: T. K. Derry, A History of Norway (London: Allen and Unwen,
1957). For Sweden: Franklin Scott, Sweden: The Nation’s History (Minneapolis:
University of Minnesota Press, 1977).
Archaeology
This is a field in which things are moving rapidly. As a result, Haakon Shetelig
and Hjalmar Falk, Scandinavian Archaeology, trans. E. V. Gordon (Oxford:
Clarendon, 1937), should be read only for background. Else Roesdahl, The Vikings,
cited above, will remain the standard for some time to come. The catalogs for the
recent Viking exhibitions, especially that of Fitzhugh and Ward, Vikings: The
Norse Atlantic Saga, also cited above, will give more detail on most topics.
Print and Nonprint Resources 329



Etymology
The standard etymological dictionary is Jan de Vries, Altnordisches etymologis
ches Wörterbuch (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962). Alexander Jóhannesson’s Isländisches
etymologisches Wörterbuch (Bern: Francke, [1951–1956]) is also valuable, but
access to entries is through Indo-European roots, so it is not for the uninitiated.
Those who cannot read German are referred to Gabriel Turville-Petre’s Myth
and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia (New York:
Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1964; reprint, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press,
1975)—though it is long out of print—which usually includes information of an
etymological nature, as do Rudolf Simek, Lexikon der altgermanischen
Mythologie, translated as Dictionary of Northern Mythology, trans. Angela Hall
(Cambridge, England, and Rochester, NY: D. S. Brewer, 1993), and Andy
Orchard, Dictionary of Norse Myth and Legend (London: Cassell, 1997). Another
resource is the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, which
contains a glossary of Indo-European roots that is interesting to consult in con
nection with an etymological discussion involving such roots.
Although there are good introductory works on the study of place-names in
the Scandinavian languages, they and nearly all the specialist literature are
unavailable in English. Those interested in the use of the gods’ names in place
names can, however, easily study the maps in de Vries’s Altgermanische Reli
gionsgeschichte, Grundriss der germanischen Philologie, 12:1–2 (Berlin: W. de
Gruyter, 1956–1957), if they have a German-English dictionary at hand.
Students wishing to learn more about the history of the Germanic languages
in general should turn to Orrin W. Robinson, Old English and Its Closest Rela
tives: A Survey of the Earliest Germanic Languages (Stanford: Stanford Univer
sity Press, 1992), and Hans Frede Nielsen, The Germanic Languages: Origins
and Early Dialectal Interrelations (Tuscaloosa and London: University of
Alabama Press, 1989). For Scandinavian, turn to Einar Haugen, The Scandina
vian Languages: An Introduction to Their History (Cambridge, MA: Harvard
University Press, 1976).
THE CONVERSION OF ICELAND
Dag Strömbäck, The Conversion of Iceland, trans. and annotated by Peter Foote,
Viking Society for Northern Research, Text Series, 6 (London: Viking Society for
Northern Research, 1975), is a model of scholarship, and one need look no fur
ther, although more complete treatment, and especially an analysis of the cen
tral events at the althingi in 1000 C.E., may be found in Jón Hnefill
330 Norse Mythology



Aƒalsteinsson, Under the Cloak: The Acceptance of Christianity in Iceland
with Particular Reference to the Religious Attitudes Prevailing at the Time, Stu
dia Ethnologica Upsaliensia, 4 (Uppsala: Almqvist and Wiksell, 1978). Those
deeply pressed for time, those who prefer their history in a popularized form, or
those who like pictures could turn to the very short work of Michael Scott
Rohan and Allan J. Scott, The Hammer and the Cross (Oxford: Alder Publishing,
1980), which presupposes no prior knowledge.
MEDIEVAL ICELAND
Since virtually all the texts of Scandinavian mythology were recorded in
medieval Iceland, a knowledge of that society will be helpful. I recommend Jón
Jóhannesson, A History of the Old Icelandic Commonwealth: Íslendinga saga
(cited above), for the historical background up through the thirteenth century.
For an excellent anthropological analysis of the Icelandic commonwealth, see
first Kirsten Hastrup, Culture and History in Medieval Iceland: An Anthropo
logical Assessment of Structure and Change (Oxford: Clarendon, 1985); this
work also includes direct commentary on the mythology, especially as regards
cosmology. Hastrup’s Island of Anthropology: Studies in Past and Present Ice
land, Viking Collection, 5 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1990), contains
other relevant essays by Hastrup, and a collection of essays is to be found in Gísli
Pálsson, ed., From Sagas to Society: Contemporary Approaches to Early Iceland
(Enfield Lock, England: Hisarlik Press, 1992). Books that focus on the interface
between history and literature are Preben Meulengracht Sørensen, Saga and
Society: An Introduction to Old Norse Literature, trans. John Tucker, Studia
Borealis/Nordic Studies, 1 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1993; Danish orig
inal 1977), and, in the two essays of its introduction, Theodore M. Andersson
and William Ian Miller, Law and Literature in Medieval Iceland: Ljósvetninga
saga and Valla-Ljóts saga (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1989). Miller’s
Bloodtaking and Peacemaking: Feud, Law, and Society in Saga Iceland
(Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1990), is a detailed and thor
ough analysis of the processes of dispute resolution as they are manifested in the
sagas; these processes are in my view directly relevant to the mythology. Stu
dents may also find useful Jesse Byock, Feud in the Icelandic Saga (Berkeley and
Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982), and Byock, Medieval Iceland
(Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1988).

WOMEN AND GENDER
The role of women in society and literature has been the subject of several recent
investigations. See Judith Jesch, Women in the Viking Age (Woodridge, England:
Boydell, 1991); Jenny Jochens, Women in Old Norse Society (Ithaca, NY: Cornell
University Press, 1995), and Jochens, Old Norse Images of Women (Philadelphia:
University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996). Carol J. Clover argues that gender is less
important than power in “Regardless of Sex: Men, Women, and Power in Early
Northern Europe,” Speculum 68 (1993): 363–387.
ENCYCLOPEDIAS
Several encyclopedias offer easy access to relevant information on Norse
mythology. Philip Pulsiano, Kirsten Wolf, Paul Acker, and Donald K. Fry,
Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia, Garland Encyclopedias of the Middle
Ages, 1; Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, 934 (New York and Lon
don: Garland Publishing, 1993), offers articles on literary, historical, and
archaeological subjects. It supplements the 22-volume Nordic compilation,
published in all five Nordic countries, entitled in Swedish Kulturhistoriskt
lexikon för nordisk medeltid från vikingatid till reformationstid (Malmö, Swe
den: Allhems förlag, 1956–1978); the articles are in the Scandinavian languages,
but the references may be helpful even to those who cannot read those lan
guages. The Dictionary of the Middle Ages, Joseph R. Strayer, general editor,
13 vols. (New York: Scribners, 1982–1989), has extensive coverage of Scandi
navia, including articles on Norse mythology. Similarly, The Encyclopedia of
Religion, Mircea Eliade, editor-in-chief, 16 vols. (New York and London:
Macmillan, 1987), contains articles on Indo-European, Germanic, and Scandi
navian myth and religion. Those who can read German will find profit in con
sulting the articles in the new edition of the Reallexikon der germanischen
Altertumskunde, ed. Heinrich Beck et al. (Berlin and New York: W. de Gruyter,
1973– ), many of which are detailed studies of myths and religious topics in
their own right. The Lexikon des Mittelalters, 9 vols. (Munich and Zurich:
Artemis Verlag, 1980–1998), has good articles on medieval history and litera
ture. Scandinavian medieval literature and mythology are also treated in Carl
Lindahl, John McNamara, and John Lindow, eds., Medieval Folklore: An Ency
clopedia of Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs, 2 vols. (Santa Bar
bara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2000).
332 Norse Mythology



PRIMARY SOURCES—TRANSLATIONS
Although several attempts have been made to translate the Poetic Edda, none
has been fully successfully, primarily because of the difficulty of the texts them
selves in several places. Henry Adams Bellows, The Poetic Edda: Translated
from the Icelandic with an Introduction and Notes (New York: American-Scan
dinavian Foundation, 1923), is still serviceable, although it employs some idio
syncratic spellings (e.g., Hovamol for Hávamál), and the copious footnotes are to
be avoided. Lee M. Hollander, The Poetic Edda: Translated with an Introduction
and Explanatory Notes, 2nd ed., rev. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1962),
uses an archaic English that is not without interest but usually baffles the ordi
nary reader. Paul B. Taylor and W. H. Auden, The Elder Edda: A Selection (New
York: Random House, 1967–1969), is the result of a collaboration between a
scholar and a distinguished poet, but its arrangement of the poems is arbitrary,
and other translations are more literally accurate. Patricia Terry, Poems of the
Vikings: The Elder Edda (Indianapolis, IN: Bobbs-Merrill [1969]), also suffers
from lapses in accuracy. The most recent translation into English, useful and
accessible, is that of Carolyne Larrington, The Poetic Edda: Translated with an
Introduction and Notes (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996).
Ursula Dronke is producing an edition of eddic poems; in addition to introduc
tions and notes, it contains English translations facing the Icelandic text.
Dronke’s translations are splendid, but the work as a whole is intended for an
academic rather than a general audience. As of this writing, two volumes have
appeared: The Poetic Edda, vol. 1, Heroic Poems: Edited with Translation, Intro
duction, and Commentary (Oxford: Clarendon, 1969), and The Poetic Edda, vol.
2, Mythological Poems: Edited with Translation, Introduction, and Commen
tary (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997; contains Völuspá, Hávamál). Finally, Sigurƒur
Nordal’s famous and influential edition of Völuspá, with commentary, is avail
able in English translation by B. S. Benedikz and John McKinnell, Durham and
St. Andrews Medieval Texts, 1 (Durham, England: Durham and St. Andrews
Medieval Texts, 1978).
The most recent English translation of Snorri Sturluson’s Edda is also the
best: Anthony Faulkes, Edda / Snorri Sturluson: Translated from the Icelandic
and Introduced, Everyman Classics, Everyman’s Library, 499 (London: Dent,
1987). A translation of most of the mythological passages is offered by Jean I.
Young, The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson: Tales from Norse Mythology,
Selected and Translated (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California
Press, c. 1954). It is accurate, and the introduction by Sigurƒur Nordal is pleas
ant, but because it omits most of Skáldskaparmál and all of Háttatal, it gives a
false impression of the work as a whole, and it is not free from occasional bowd

lerization. Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur’s The Prose Edda, by Snorri Sturluson:
Translated from the Icelandic with an Introduction, Scandinavian Classics, 5
(New York: American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1916), is long out of print but
still quite usable.
Some mythological skaldic verses are gathered in Lee M. Hollander, The
Skalds: A Selection of Their Poems, with Introductions and Notes (Princeton:
Princeton University Press, for the American-Scandinavian Foundation, New
York, c. 1945); some may also be found translated and explicated in Gabriel
Turville-Petre’s Scaldic Poetry (Oxford: Clarendon, 1976). Other significant
verse may be found in Hollander, Old Norse Poems: The Most Important Non
Skaldic Verse Not Included in the Poetic Edda (New York: Columbia University
Press, 1936; reprint, Millwood, NY: Kraus Reprint Co., 1973).
The Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus has been rendered into English
twice. From the Victorian era is The First Nine Books of the Danish History of
Saxo Grammaticus, trans. Oliver Elton, with “Some Considerations on Saxo’s
Sources, Historical Methods, and Folk-Lore,” by Frederick York Powell, Publica
tions of the Folk-lore Society, 33 (London: D. Nutt, 1894). Our era found its Saxo
in The History of the Danes / Saxo Grammaticus, trans. Peter Fisher, ed. Hilda
Ellis Davidson (Cambridge, England: D. S. Brewer; Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Lit
tlefield, 1979–1980), which has a very handy commentary by Hilda Ellis Davidson.
Finally, Hermann Pálsson and Magnus Magnus Magnusson, The Vinland
Sagas: The Norse Discovery of America (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1965), offers
readers the chance to consider for themselves the literary evidence for the Scan
dinavian excursions to North America half a millennium before Columbus; in
the context of this work, it is relevant because of the elaborate description of a
seid ceremony in chapter 3 of Eiríks saga rauda (The Saga of Erik the Red).
PRIMARY SOURCES—COMMENTARY AND ANALYSIS
Eddic and Skaldic Poetry
Unfortunately, this is perhaps the area in which one is most handicapped by an
inability to read German and the Scandinavian languages. A number of commen
taries to eddic poetry have appeared over the years, but all are in German, even
the one announced by a team of scholars at Frankfurt and manifest in sample
texts. The only commentaries, therefore, are those attached to the translations
mentioned above. Dronke’s is the most satisfying, but she has placed fairly severe
limits on going beyond actual textual issues. Larrington’s notes are also sound,
but I cannot recommend with any enthusiasm anything else on the eddic corpus.
334 Norse Mythology



And the case is all but hopeless for skaldic poetry. There are, to be sure, the com
mentaries accompanying Turville-Petre’s and Hollander’s translations, but the
texts presented are very limited. There are also, of course, monographic treat
ments of various important skaldic poems, but these texts are so difficult that
such treatments tend generally to limit themselves to comment on language and
grammar rather than on content. Those who can read the Scandinavian languages
can make use of the corpora and commentaries created by Finnur Jónsson and
Ernst Albin Kock; on the problems inherent to these, see Roberta Frank, “Skaldic
Poetry,” in Carol J. Clover and John Lindow, eds., Old Norse-Icelandic Literature:
A Critical Guide, Islandica, 45 (Ithaca, NY, and London: Cornell University
Press, 1985).
An idiosyncratic study of eddic poetry is Eleazar Meletinskij, The Elder
Edda and Early Forms of the Epic, trans. Kenneth H. Ober, Hesperides, 6, (Tri
este: Parnaso, 1998).
Snorri Sturluson
A biography of Snorri Sturluson and consideration of his writing is Marlene Cik
lamini, Snorri Sturluson, Twayne’s World Authors Series, TWAS 493: Iceland
(Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1978). It lacks the authority of Sigurƒur Nordal’s
magisterial Snorri Sturluson ([Reykjavík]: ∏ór. B. ∏orláksson, 1920), but that
work has never been translated from the original Icelandic. A fine study of
Snorri’s Heimskringla is Sverre Bagge, Society and Politics in Snorri Sturluson’s
Heimskringla (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1991).
Recent collections of essays about Snorri and his work include Snorri: Átta alda
minning (Reykjavík : Sögufelag, 1979), a volume in which Icelandic scholars con
template eight centuries of the memory of Snorri; Úlfar Bragason, ed., Snor
rastefna: 25.–27. Júlí 1990 (Reykjavík: Stofnun Sigurƒar Nordals, 1992)—despite
the Icelandic title, more than half the essays are in English; Alois Wolf, ed.,
Snorri Sturluson: Kolloquium anlässlich der 750. Wiederkehr seines Todestages,
Script Oralia, 51 (Tübingen: G. Narr, c. 1993); and Hans Fix, ed., Snorri Sturlu
son: Beitrage zu Werk und Rezeption, Ergänzungsbände zum Reallexikon der
germanischen Altertumskunde, 18 (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1998). Margaret Clu
nies Ross, Skáldskaparmál: Snorri Sturluson’s Ars Poetica and Medieval Theo
ries of Language, Viking Collection, 4 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1987),
sets Skáldskaparmál against the learned medieval encyclopedic background.

against Heimskringla. A German commentary (accompanying a translation) to
Snorri’s Gylfaginning that I have found very useful is that of Gottfried Lorenz,
Snorri Sturluson, Gylfaginning: Texte, Übersetzung, Kommentar, Texte zur
Forschung, 48 (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1984). On Heim
skringla, see Diana Whaley, Heimskringla: An Introduction, Viking Society for
Northern Research Text Series, 3 (London: University College, 1991).
LITERARY HISTORIES
The most recent general survey in English is that of Jónas Kristjánsson, Eddas and
Sagas: Iceland’s Medieval Literature, trans. Peter Foote (Reykjavík: Hiƒ íslenska
bókmenntafélag, 1988). A collection of essays summarizing the state of scholarship
and including extensive bibliographies for myth and mythography, eddic poetry,
skaldic poetry, kings’ sagas, sagas of Icelanders, and romances is Carol J. Clover and
John Lindow, eds., Old Norse-Icelandic Literature: A Critical Guide (cited above).
The fornaldarsögur are the most important omission from that collection, but it
was somewhat remedied by the publication of Stephen A. Mitchell, Heroic Sagas
and Ballads (Ithaca, NY, and London: Cornell University Press, 1991).
The relationship between the social conditions and the literature is pre
sented in Preben Meulengracht Sørensen’s excellent Saga and Society: An Intro
duction to Old Norse Literature (cited above). Meulengracht Sørensen is
particularly good on mythic patterns in the literature in general. Sigurƒur
Nordal, Icelandic Culture, trans. and with notes by Vilhjalmur T. Bjarnar
(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Library, 1990) is not, strictly speaking, a literary
history, but it offers much that is of interest. Those who read German may turn
to Jan de Vries, Altnordische Literaturgeschichte, 2 vols., Grundriss der ger
manischen Philologie, 15–16 (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1964), but all the other stan
dard literary surveys are in the Scandinavian languages.
MYTHOLOGY: GENERAL TREATMENTS
Scandinavian myth and religion is a field in which much older work is still read
and cited, with the inevitable result that a great percentage of the material is in
German and the Scandinavian languages (there is also much of interest in Italian,
French, and Russian, among others). It is possible to get a sense of the scholar
ship up to the early 1980s by consulting my Scandinavian Mythology: An Anno
tated Bibliography, Garland Folklore Bibliographies, 13 (New York: Garland,
1988). If there is a standard reference work, it is Jan de Vries, Altgermanische
336 Norse Mythology



Religionsgeschichte, 2 vols., 2nd ed., Grundriss der germanischen Philologie,
12–13 (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1956–1967). However, there are many introductory
works in English that can be recommended. The best in my view remains that
of Gabriel Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of
Ancient Scandinavia (cited above), but it is long out of print. H. R. Ellis David
son, Gods and Myths of Northern Europe (Baltimore: Penguin, 1964), pays less
attention to textual detail than I would like but remains in print and is sound.
Davidson also contributed a large-format book originally entitled Scandinavian
Mythology (London and New York: Hamlyn, 1969) and recently reissued as
Viking and Norse Mythology (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1996); this work has
especially attractive plates of many of the more significant artifacts. A very brief
treatment, but quite nice, is that of R. I. Page, Norse Myths (London: British
Museum; and Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990). A very long treatment is
the volume in the older series Mythology of All Races by John Arnott MacCul
loch (the editor of the series) entitled simply Eddic (New York: M. Jones; reprint,
New York: Cooper Square Publishers, 1964).
I am not fond of works that in their systematization take readers away from
the texts; unlike, say, Greek mythology, Norse mythology is actually found in
such a limited textual corpus that it seems to me indefensible to part from it.
Thus I cannot recommend the work of the Norwegian historian Peter Andreas
Munch, revised by the great philologist Magnus Olsen and available in English
as Norse Mythology: Legends of Gods and Heroes, trans. Sigure Bernhard
Hustvedt (New York: American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1927), although the
Norwegian version, with comments added by Anne Holtsmark, is definitely
worth a look. Nor do I recommend Brian Branston, Gods of the North (New
York: Vanguard, n.d. [1955?]), or Kevin Crossley-Holland, The Norse Myths:
Introduced and Retold (New York: Pantheon Books, 1980).
MYTHOLOGY: IMPORTANT STUDIES
The best modern treatment of the mythology, and one to which every serious
reader can turn with profit, is Margaret Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes: Old
Norse Myths in Medieval Northern Society, vol. 1, The Myths, Viking Collec
tion, 7 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), and vol. 2, The Reception of
Norse Myths in Medieval Iceland, Viking Collection, 10 (Odense: Odense Uni
versity Press, 1998). The first volume succeeds admirably in reading the entire
mythology as a system in which the ongoing opposition between the gods and
giants is read as a struggle involving social hierarchies within a complex sym
bolic system. Clunies Ross knows the scholarship intimately and has masterful
Print and Nonprint Resources 337



analytic skills; if you read only one book on the mythology (other than the one
in your hands now), make it this one. Volume 2 is of more interest in connec
tion with rest of Old Norse–Icelandic literature, but it is equally enthralling.
Two other recent A-to-Z treatments of the mythology have preceded this
one. The earlier was that of Rudolf Simek, Dictionary of Northern Mythology,
cited above; the German original appeared in 1984 in a series of small-format
encyclopedias and therefore was presumably formed at least in part to fit the
parameters of that series. It is trustworthy and particularly helpful if one is
interested in postmedieval manifestations of the mythology in art, literature,
and music, for articles ordinarily end with information about such manifesta
tions. Since the work was originally intended for German readers, secondary lit
erature in English is cited only when the author deems it particularly relevant,
and full references are not cited. The second such encyclopedia was that of Andy
Orchard, Dictionary of Norse Myth and Legend, cited above. As is the case with
Simek, the scholarship is wholly sound. Orchard’s book has greater coverage in
that it also takes in heroic legend, and the result is that the mythological entries
tend to be somewhat shorter than those in Simek’s volume. The book also con
tains not quite 40 illustrations. A particularly nice touch is the set of appendices
listing and offering translations for the numerous names of Odin, dwarfs, giants,
and “troll-wives, giantesses and valkyries.” Bibliographic citations in the body
of the texts are to about 850 items gathered in four lists in the back of the book.
The thinking of Georges Dumézil on Norse mythology and its relationship
with Indo-European myth and religion may be found in Dumézil, Gods of the
Ancient Northmen, ed. Einar Haugen, trans. John Lindow, Alan Toth, Francis
Charat, and George Gopen, Publications of the UCLA Center for Comparative
Folklore and Mythology, 3 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California
Press, 1973). This book comprises a translation of Dumézil’s Les dieux des ger
mains: Essai sur la formation de la religion scandinave (Paris: Presses Universi
taires de France, 1959), and translations of four articles specifically on
Scandinavian mythology. Dumézil’s later arguments about the displacement of
myth into epic are available in Dumézil, From Myth to Fiction: The Saga of
Hadingus, trans. Derek Coltman (Chicago and London: University of Chicago
Press, 1973), which followed by only three years the French original, Du mythe
au roman: La Saga de Hadingus et autre essais (Paris: Presses Universitaires de
France, 1970). His huge study Mythe et epopée (Paris: Gallimard, 1968–1975) was
rendered piecemeal into English: The Destiny of a King, trans. Alf Hiltebeitel
(Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1973); Camillus: A Study of
Indo-European Religion as Roman History, trans. Annette Aronowicz and
Josette Bryson, ed. Udo Strutynski (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of Cal
ifornia Press, 1980); The Stakes of the Warrior, trans. David Weeks, ed. Jaan
338 Norse Mythology



Puhvel (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1983); The
Plight of a Sorcerer, ed. Jaan Puhvel and David Weeks (Berkeley and Los Angeles:
University of California Press, 1986). Those who long for more Dumézil but can
not read French could turn next to his Mitra-Varuna: An Essay on Two Indo
European Representations, trans. Derek Coltman (New York: Zone Books, 1988),
a classic of the Dumézilian dossier, or the curious Riddle of Nostradamus: A
Critical Dialogue, trans. Betsy Wing (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press,
1999). For a vade mecum through the many ins and outs of Dumézil’s work up
to 1980 or so, see C. Scott Littleton, The New Comparative Mythology: An
Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of Georges Dumézil, 3rd ed. (Berke
ley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982). An incisive non
Dumézilian reading is offered by Jarich G. Oosten, The War of the Gods: The
Social Code in Indo-European Mythology (London: Routledge, 1985).
Two recent works by Hilda Ellis Davidson, who has contributed greatly to the
study of Norse mythology, are Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scan
dinavian and Celtic Religions (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1988),
and The Lost Beliefs of Northern Europe (London and New York: Routledge,
1993). Where Davidson explores the Celtic interface, Thomas DuBois reminds us
of the existence of the religions of the Sámi and Finns in Viking Age Scandinavia:
Viking Ages Religions (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999).
A connection between the texts of eddic poetry and ritual was first argued by
Bertha Philpotts, The Elder Edda and Ancient Scandinavian Drama (Cambridge,
England: Cambridge University Press, 1920). Terry Gunnell, The Origins of Drama
in Scandinavia (Cambridge, England: D. S. Brewer, 1995), revisits the issue.
NONPRINT RESOURCES
Keying “Norse mythology” into the Google search engine on the world wide
web, I got 8,540 hits. Clearly there is a lot of stuff out there. At http://www.pan
theon.org/mythica/areas/norse/, one of the first sites I visited, I found an A-to
Z listing of the major and minor figures in Norse mythology similar to what is
found in this book. This listing is part of The Encyclopedia Mythica: An Ency
clopedia on Mythology, Folklore, and Legend. Randomly looking at some
entries, I found this on Bragi:
The god of eloquence and poetry, and the patron of skalds (poets) in Norse
mythology. He is regarded as a son of Odin and Frigg. Runes were carved on
his tongue and he inspired poetry in humans by letting them drink from the
mead of poetry. Bragi is married to Idun, the goddess of eternal youth. Oaths
Print and Nonprint Resources 339



were sworn over the Bragarfull (Cup of Bragi), and drinks were taken from it
in honor of a dead king. Before a king ascended the throne, he drank from such
a cup.
There are no fewer than six errors in this paragraph (the lingual runes being
the most spectacular), and this sad fact leads me to the major point that must be
made about materials to be found on the Internet: Use them at your own risk.
Content is easy to find, but there is no quality control. The Internet is best used
to look at things like maps, images (samples of actual Old Norse–Icelandic manu
scripts, for example, may be viewed at http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami), or the actual
text of some primary source. (There are many Internet sites offering primary
sources, but my comments in Chapter 4 about primary sources apply here, too.)
I know of two sites with bibliographies. The Bibliography of Old Norse
Icelandic Studies, at the University of Odense Library in Denmark, covers the
entire field, not just the mythology. Its English-language URL is http://www.
sdu.dk/oub/fagomraa/nordisk/boniseng.htm. A very brief bibliography of the
Poetic Edda compiled at the Fiske Icelandic Collection of the Cornell University
Library may be found at http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/Fiske/edda.html.
Scott Trimble, a former student in my undergraduate class at the University
of California at Berkeley on Scandinavian mythology, has built the website
http://www.stst.net/Scandinavian/. The genealogy page is a brave attempt to
concoct a single genealogy for the entire system. Browsing sites that sell term
papers, I found that one can obtain an eight-page paper titled “The Giant Loki in
Norse Mythology” for $8.95 per page (a few months later the price had risen to
$9.95). I didn’t buy it, but skimming the summary gave me the impression that
I may in fact have already read it.
Look about on the Internet. You will find descriptions of the mythology;
encyclopedic listings long and short; student term papers; collections of texts;
collections of pictures; close and imaginative retellings of the myths; fiction;
poetry and music; Wiccan sites; neopagan sites of various kinds, some including
on-line shrines; games; rants and ravings; course curricula; children’s literature;
comic books; clubs to join; sites devoted in whatever way to individual gods and
goddesses; a “scavenger hunt” (actually a list of questions apparently used in a
unit on the mythology in some school); a “guest book” to which you can post
any comment you like relating, however tenuously, to Norse mythology;
instructions to third-grade teachers doing a unit on Norse mythology; instruc
tions for integrating the study of Norse mythology into home schooling; science
fiction; astrology. Just exercise care. If it doesn’t look right, it probably isn’t.
After all, if I, an expert in Old Norse–Icelandic mythology, were to devise and
print on the Internet plans for a supersonic jet, would you build and fly it?
