The inscription appears on the base of the statue. It is written in the Siddhamatrika script, a development of the Brahmi script.[5]
This great and beautiful Mahā-Vināyaka was consecrated by the renowned Ṣāhī king, the illustrious Sri Khingāla, who was Parama-bhattharaka-maharajadhiraja, in the eighth year (of his reign), in the maha-jyestha-masa, sukla-paksa, trayoda'si, visakha naksatra and Simha lagna.

Seal of Khingila

Location of the region of Bactria, to which the seal belongs.
Seal with Bactrian legend:
"Companion of the God of War"
Material Garnet cabochon gem
Size 22.8 mm high, 19.4 mm wide, 5.9 mm thick[2]
Writing Bactrian language
Created 5th-6th century CE
The seal has a Bactrian language inscription mentioning the ruler "Eshkingil", with the title xoadeo ("Lord", "King"), and has been dated to the 5th-6th century CE, or to the first half of the 5th century CE. The legend, deciphered by Nicholas Sims-Williams, reads:
εϸκιγγιλο (...) (ρ)ωκανο χοηο eškiggilo (...) (r)ōkano xoēo
"Eškiŋgil, Lord of (Ga)rokan"
— Legend on the seal.
The complete reading may be "Eshkingil, lord of (the people) such-and-such" or "Eshkingil,
son of so-and-so, the lord".[2] "Eshkingil" ( , εϸκιγγιλο, Eškiŋil) may be a title consisting in the Turkic prefix Eš- meaning “comrade, companion of” and "-kenglu", the sacred sword and god ("Kenglu-shen") worshipped by the Xiongnu, so that "Eškiŋgil" could be a Hunnic name or title meaning “Companion of the Sword”, or even "Companion of the God of War".
The seal may also have belonged to the Alchon Hun ruler Khingila, who appears in his
coinage with the Bactrian legend (χιγγιλο αλχοννο "Khiggilo (SimsWilliams, Nicholas (2002) 'The Bactrian inscription on the seal of Khingila.' Silk Road Art and Archaeology, vol. 8. pp. 143–148) Alchono"). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Khingila

I submit that the flower held in the left hand of Khingila is tabernae montana. The Indus script rebus reading is: tagaraka 'fragrance flower, tabernae montana' rebus: tagara 'tin ore'. The flowers also adorn the crown of Khingila.
A coin of Khingila with the title Deva Shahi Kinghila ( "God-King Khingila"), 440-490 CE
A famous Khingila is known from the dynasty of the Alchon Huns, and one of his coins has
the legend "Deva Shahi Khingila" ( "God-King Khingila"), but he is dated quite earlier, to the 5th century CE )
"Uddiyana was probably first mentioned by Chinese pilgrims. Faxian (337 – c. 422), Song Yun (? - 528) and Xuanzang (602–664, India 629–641) travelled to an area they refer to as Uchang or U-chang-na, which is commonly agreed a transliteration of Udyana (Skt. Uḍyāna). Based on the accounts of these pilgrims, Udyana was thus identified with the Swat district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. Sanderson mentions that likewise an inscription on the base of the Gaṇeśa statue from Gardēz as well as a the Kumārapālacaritasaṃgraha, a Jain text, confirm Uḍḍiyāna’s location in this area.Manjushrimulakalpa (Skt.

"The Alchon Huns, who invaded northern India and were known there as "Hūṇas", have long been considered as a part or a sub-division of the Hephthalites, or as their eastern branch, but now tend to be considered as a separate entity, who may have been displaced by the settlement of the Hephthalites in Bactria.Historians such as Beckwith, referring to Étienne de la Vaissière, say that the Hephthalites were not necessarily one and the same as the Hunas (Sveta Huna). According to de la Vaissiere, the Hephthalites are not directly identified in classical sources alongside that of the Hunas. They were initially based in the Oxus basin in Central Asia and established their control over Gandhara in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent by about 465 CE. From there, they fanned out into various parts of northern, western, and central India.In India, these invading people were called Hunas, or "Sveta Huna" (White Huns) in Sanskrit. The Hūṇas are mentioned in several ancient texts such as the Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata,
Purāṇas, and Kalidasa's Raghuvaṃśa. The first Hunas, probably Kidarites, were initially defeated by Emperor Skandagupta of the Gupta Empire in the 5th century CE.In the early 6th century CE, the Alchon Hun Hunas in turn overran the part of the Gupta Empire that was to their southeast and had conquered Central and North India. Gupta Emperor Bhanugupta defeated the Hunas under Toramana in 510, and his son Mihirakula was repulsed by Yashodharman in 528 CE, The Hunas were driven out of India by the kings Yasodharman and Narasimhagupta, during the early 6th century."

Find spots of epigraphic inscriptions indicating local control by the Alchon Huns in India between 500-530 CE.
"Alchon Huns, also known as
the Alchono, Alxon, Alkhon, Alkhan, Alakhana and Walxon, were a nomadic people who established states in Central Asia and South Asia during the 4th and 6th centuries CE. They were first mentioned as being located in Paropamisus, and later expanded south-east, into the Punjab and central India, as far as Eran and Kausambi. The Alchon invasion of the Indian subcontinent eradicated the Kidarite Huns who had preceded them by about a century, and contributed to the fall of the Gupta Empire, in a sense bringing an end to Classical India.The invasion of India by the Huna peoples follows invasions of the subcontinent in the preceding centuries by the Yavana (Indo-Greeks), the Saka (Indo-Scythians), the Palava (IndoParthians), and the Kushana (Yuezhi). The Alchon Empire was the third of four major Huna states established in Central and South Asia. The Alchon were preceded by the Kidarites and succeeded by the Hephthalites in Bactria and the Nezak Huns in the Hindu Kush. The names of the Alchon kings are known from their extensive coinage, Buddhist accounts, and a number of commemorative inscriptions throughout the Indian subcontinent.The Alchons have

Portrait of Alchon king Khingila (c.450 CE), Portrait of an older King Khingila, founder of the Alchon Huns, on one of his coins, c. 430 – 490 CE. and the bull/ lunar tamga of the Alchon (known as Tamgha S1),as visible on Alchon coinage. "Around 430 King Khingila, the most notable Alchon ruler, and the first one to be named and represented on his coins with the legend "χιγγιλο" (Kiggilo) in Bactrian, emerged and took control of the routes across the Hindu Kush from the Kidarites. He seems to have been a contemporary of the Sassanian ruler Bahram V. As the Alchons took control, diplomatic missions were established in 457 with China. Khingila, under the name Shengil, was called "King of India" in the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchon_Huns
The word "Alchono" (αλχοννο) in cursive Bactrian script, on a coin of the Alchon Huns ruler Khingila, 5th century CE. The second element chono is the ethnic name Hun. Alchon Huns identify themselves as ALXONO on their coinage, with xono representing Hun: they were identified as Hūṇa in Indian sources."The second wave of Huns according to Göbl’s account was that of the so-called “Alkhon.” Their name is almost exclusively known from inscriptions on coins (but cf. Markwart, p. 141), which Göbl (cf. 1967, I, pp. 56-57, 7072, 218-219; II, pp. 59-66) interprets as ALXONO, in which the component -xon represents a Hun name (Göbl, 1978, p. 107). The Alkhon pushed back the Kidarites step by step and finally occupied the whole of northwestern India. They represented the group of Huns who were called “Hūṇas” in the Indian sources. Particularly well known were their rulers Khiṇgila, his successor Tora-māṇa, and the notorious animal torturer Mihirakula, who was eventually defeated by a group of Indian maharajas. After his death ca. 542–50 C.E., part of the Indian Alkhon appear to have migrated back to Afghanistan (Göbl, 1967, II, pp. 58, 70; Alram, p. 138; but cf. Frye, pp. 348, 355-56)."(Schottky, Martin (2004). "Huns". Encyclopaedia Iranica)

"Most of us know Varaha as the third avatar of Lord Vishnu, when he took the form of a boar. But Varaha is, in fact, a fascinating part of Hindu mythology with a remarkable tale. He is deeply connected to the legend of creation since he is the one who rescued the Earth Goddess or Bhudevi. This is an important episode in Vaishnavism and is depicted and celebrated in temples across India.
Most of the major religions in the world have a creation myth associated with a flood but few realise that even Hinduism has one. The Earth Goddess Bhudevi was captured by the demon Hiranayaksha and trapped in the cosmic waters when Vishnu took the form of a divine boar and rescued her after battling the demon for a thousand years. Explore with us the tale of Varaha, the third avatar of Vishnu.

Although associated with Vishnu, the earliest reference to the divine boar is as a form of Brahma. According to a story in the Taittriya Aranyaka and the Shatapatha Brahmana, the universe was originally water and the earth and was only as big as the span of the human hand. Brahma took the form of a boar, Ermusha, and lifted his spouse (bhu), the Earth, out of the water.
The boar is said to have emerged from the nostril of Brahma and grown, first to the size of an elephant, then a mountain and finally into 10 yojanas (a yojana is said to be between 6 and 15 km) in width and 1,000 yojanas in height, before lifting the Earth out of the water.
The most well-known story of Varaha, however, is as the avatar of Vishnu and is told in the epics and in many of the Puranas like the Vayu Purana and Vishnu Purana but with slight variations. According to the legend, two gatekeepers of Vishnu turned away four wandering sages, due to which they were cursed to be reborn as asuras. They were then reborn as demon brothers, Hiranayaksha and Hiranakashyap, to the sage Kashyapa and his wife Diti. They practiced intense penance and were granted boons by Brahma.

Subsequently, they created havoc, and Hiranayaksha captured Bhudevi, the Earth Goddess, and took her into the cosmic waters. On seeing this, Vishnu took the avatar of Varaha to rescue her. Hiranayaksha tried to prevent him and Varaha battled him for a thousand years. Varaha finally vanquished Hiranayaksha and rescued Bhudevi. Later, the fourth avatar of Vishnu, Narasimha, vanquished the other asura brother Hiranakashyap. The fact that these two were vanquished by avatars of Vishnu allowed them to attain salvation.



15
Varaha worship was significant in Central India during the Gupta period, particularly from the 4th to the 6th century CE. We find many depictions of Varaha from this time. The worship of Varaha was also significant in the South-Eastern part of India as can be seen from the 7th to 8th century CE rock-cut shrine of Varaha at Mahabalipuram.
Varaha was a significant part of Kashmir Vaishnavism of the early medieval period as a part of the Vaikuntha Vishnu. There are many temples where he is still worshiped, like the Bhu Varaha Swami Temple in Srimushnam, Tamil Nadu.
Since the most significant legend associated with Varaha is his rescue of the Earth Goddess Bhudevi, almost all his depictions are shown with Bhudevi either holding onto his tusk/snout or sitting in his lap. What is interesting about Varaha is that he is depicted in two distinct ways – one is with the head of a boar and torso of a man, which is called the ‘Naravaraha’, and the other as a wild boar.

The Varaha at Rani ki Vav at Patan | Wikimedia Commons
The Naravaraha can be seen in a martial pose, with one leg stretched back and the other with a bent knee and Bhudevi holding onto his tusk or snout. He has a strong, muscular build with a dagger at his right hip. He is usually depicted holding the attributes (shankh, chakra, gadha, padma) or abhaya mudra of Vishnu, that is, all four or just two of these depending on the



17
number of arms he is shown with. Bhudevi, who is holding onto him and is suspended in mid-air, is shown with an expression of joy and shyness.
In the wild boar depiction, sometimes stylistic liberties are taken in showing Varaha. The body is heavily carved with gods and goddesses and Bhudevi is shown sitting in front holding his tusk.
The most famous and elaborate depiction of Varaha in the Naravaraha form is at Udayagiri in Madhya Pradesh (dated to around 5th century CE), while the Varaha temple (dated to around 900-925 CE) at Khajuraho has one of the best-known representations of Varaha in the wild boar form.
According to some legends, Bhudevi became Varaha’s spouse and they had a child called Naraka or Narakasura, who became the lord of Naraka. Hindu dynasties like the three dynasties of Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa (present-day Assam) claim descent from Narakasura. The boar was also the symbol of ruling dynasties like the Chalukyas, Kakatiyas and the Vijayanagara dynasties.
Worship of Varaha and Narsimha (Vishnu’s fourth avatar) is closely intertwined and they are often worshipped together as can be seen in the most popular shrine of Narasimha, the Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Temple in Simhalan, Andhra Pradesh, where the icon has the head of a boar, the torso of a man and the tail of a lion. The Vaikunth form of Vishnu was also popular in medieval Kashmir.
Label copy
March 28, 2009 The body of Vishnu’s boar-headed incarnation, Varaha, forges a diagonal bolt through this sculpture. His right foot is planted decisively at the corner of its projecting base; his left is flexed for leverage on a lotus pedestal. Against these rooting forces his body surges upward, culminating in an acutely raised snout. The magnitude of Varaha’s gesture and his relative scale suggest a superhuman strength, and his feet are splayed apart in a position that defies human physiology. In Hindu image making, the remarkable form of a god’s body reveals his or her boundless capacities. In this case, Varaha’s distinct posture depicts a well-known Hindu episode in which Vishnu took the form of a great boar to rescue the world from a demon who had imprisoned the earth beneath the cosmic ocean.

Subject matter
Stories of the incarnations of Vishnu are very common and various groups of different numbers of incarnations are found. The most standard one is of ten, the Dasavatara. Varaha, the boar incarnation is number three in the series. The first five are non-human or at least fullsized human, the fifth being a dwarf. The Cosmic Boar was necessary to save the Earth goddess who had been captured by a demon and dragged to the bottom of the ocean. Varaha dived into the sea and saved the goddess. This is a myth that is sometimes associated with other India-Aryan flood stories as is the first incarnation, Matysa, the fish.
Physical Description
This intricate stele has a large Varaha in the center. He is in the archer’s stance, with his right leg extended and his left leg bent resting on a lotus held up by a male and female snake



18
figures. They have human bodies from the waist up and knotted snake bodies below. Varaha has a human body with the head of a boar, his head thrown back supporting the figure of the earth goddess who holds on to his snout. A lotus leaf acts as an umbrella over his head. Three of his four arms are intact with his right one at his hip holding a broken lotus, only the stem survives, and the two left hands holding a conch at his chest and a discus at his knee. The broken arm held the club and the top of it is still visible next to the pavilion on the left over his shoulder. Besides the two snake figures, three figures stand on the base to either side, the other one female, while the others are male. The inner two hold the conch and discus and can be considered shankhapurausha and cakrapurusha, the personifications of the two weapons. The figure in the center on the left ahs his hand raised over his head and the one on the right holds an arrow. They stand against pilaster forms, each surmounted by a pillared pavilion. To the sides of the pillars, vyalis (a composite animal) decorate the columns, a conventional throne motif and above them on the outside some devotee figures, the one on the right is broken. Against the pillar a broken animal figure is to the right and a seated devotee is seen on the left. The two pavilion forms house gods. The one to the left houses a small four-armed image of Brahma (three of his heads show, the central one with a beard) holding his usual attributes, a ladle for ritual and probably a pot, etc.. That on the right houses a four-armed figure of Shiva holding a trident and other attributes. The top of the stele is broken, but there is a devotee to the left and a row of seven figures all with hand up in a reassuring gesture and the other holding a pot. Could there have been two more and represent the nine planets? They do not appear very different one from the other."

Varaha panel in Udayagiri Cave 5 is one of the most studied reliefs from the Gupta Empire era. It narrates the Hindu mythology about a man-boar avatar of Vishnu (Varaha) rescuing goddess earth (Bhudevi, Prithivi) from the depths of cosmic ocean. "Cave 5 is a shallow niche more than a cave and contains the much-celebrated colossal Varaha panel of Udayagiri Caves. It is the narrative of Vishnu in his Varaha or manboar avatar rescuing goddess earth in crisis...The Hindu legend has roots in the Vedic literature such as Taittariya Samhita and Shatapatha Brahmana, and is found in many postVedic texts.The legend depicts goddess earth (Bhudevi, Prithivi) in an existential crisis after she has been attacked and kidnapped by oppressive demon Hiranyaksha, where neither she nor the life she supports can survive. She is drowning and overwhelmed in the cosmic ocean. Vishnu emerges in the form of a man-boar avatar. He, as the hero in the legend, descends into the ocean, finds her, she hangs onto his tusk, he lifts her out to safety. The good wins, the crisis ends, and Vishnu once again fulfills his cosmic duty. The Varaha legend has been one of many historic legends in the Hindu text embedded with right versus wrong, good versus evil symbolism, and of someone willing to go to the depths and do what is necessary to rescue the good, the right, the dharma. The Varaha panel narrates this legend. The goddess earth is personified as the dangling woman, the hero as the colossal giant. His success is cheered by a galaxy of the divine as well as human characters valued and revered in the 4thcentury. Their iconography of individual characters is found in Hindu texts."

Eran
BY KEVINSTANDAGEHOTOGRAPHY ON MARCH 10, 2018 • ( 17 COMMENTS )
Eran (Sanskrit:ऐरण ) is a small village situated on the south bank of the river Bina, a tributary of the river Betwa, about 100 km north east of the ancient sites of Vidisha, Sanchi and Udayagiri. Eran is probably one of the most ancient towns in India, coins and epigraphs



26
found here give us it’s ancient names of Erakanya, Erakaina and Airikina and it was no doubt a significant stop on the ancient route from Vidisha to Mathura.
Excavations between 1960 and 1965 have revealed settlement deposits dating back to the second millennium B.C. However, the most significant archaeological finds from Eran has to be over 3,000 coins, dating from 300 B.C. through to 100 A.D. The most prevalent type of coins unearthed were square ones, and has contributed to archaeologists believing that Eran was once one of the ancient mints for Indian kingdoms along with Vidisha, Ujjain and Tripuri.
The principal Hindu monuments that can be seen at Eran today are all located in one small complex west of the town. There are the remains of four to five temples here, the main temples standing in a line on a north-south alignment at the far end of the entrance.
Varaha Temple



27
Undoubtedly the most iconic image from Eran, and rightly so. The colossal Varaha at Eran is believed to be the earliest known example of its kind, measuring approx 11 feet high, 5 feet wide and 14 feet in length, and wonderfully decorated with 1,185 figures of sages arranged in twelve rows.
These carvings cover the body, legs, throat, forehead and neck of the Varaha, but the details extend far beyond that. Hanging from the right tusk of Varaha is Bhudevi, in the ears are Vidyadharas (celestial musicians), together with a garland consisting of 28 circles, 27 of them containing an image of male and female figures, the last remaining circle housing a scorpion.
Note: these twenty-seven circles represent the those number of Hindu Zodiac signs, while the scorpion figure suggests that the figure of Varāha was installed during Vrschik Rashi period. https://puratattva.in/2011/07/14/eran-a-lost-monumental-legacy-2-163

29
On the chest and throat of the Varaha are four rows of male figures totalling 96 figures in total, each one holding a water pot in one hand. Set in the upper middle of this panel is a single image of Vishnu, the arms sadly now broken off.



30
Also on the front chest is a Toramana inscription. This confirms that the Hunas had invaded the north west and displaced the Gupta Empire, which ties down a date for the colossal Varaha to around the early 6th century.



31
Notice how the Varaha’s tongue is sticking out slightly, and on it is standing a small goddess who has been interpreted as Saraswati (or Vedic goddess Vac).



32



33
And don’t forget to look down ! Carved on the floor between the boars legs is a depiction of the ocean, with serpents and sea life.
It’s a magical image, I won’t even start to disclose how many photographs I took of this
The boar today stands in the open, but it would have once been housed in a small temple, the ruins of which Cunningham first recorded in 1847 and again in 1871. We know there were walls and a mandapa, the remains of which have now been cleared away from the boar, but the footprint of the structure suggests a rectangular temple similar to the Varaha shrine at Khajuraho.



34
Some distance in front of the Varaha platform is a large stone slab, 6 feet in length and aligned with that temple. On the stone is some large shell script which remains undeciphered. Many believe this to have been the original temple entrance.



35
Vishnu Temple



36
This houses the impressive image of Vishnu, 13 feet high and located in the temple sanctum.

It’s an evocative image, another excuse for my camera to work overtime The way Vishnu is framed by the doorway is just so perfect.
This is the best preserved temple at Eran, and although the roof and walls are missing the decorated sanctum doorway is intact. The door jambs have images of Yamuna and Ganga, river goddesses that are typically found higher up in door jambs from the Gupta period. This has led some experts to believe that the doorway and front mandapa was installed during the Pratihara period, which would date those structures to the 8th or 9th century.

Just like the colossal Varaha, this is a statue that I can’t help returning to and photographing again !

Narasimha Temple

44
Little remains of this temple structure now, aside from a damaged statue of Narasimha, broken at the knees, resting on a carved slab. Nearby is a pedestal with remains of the feet, originally this statue would have been over 7 feet tall.



45
It strikes me that this would be a great opportunity to get him upright again with a little bit of effort and renovation. It seems a shame that this statue is left on the ground when we have both the Varaha and Vishnu statues alongside and correctly in-situ.



46
Pillar
Also known as the Buddhagupta pillar or Bhima pillar, it stands 43 feet high with a capital in the shape of a reeded bell.

48
Above this is an abacus with lions, and finally two male figures, 5 feet high standing back to back with a wheeled halo between them.



49



50
One of the figures is overseeing the temples, the other overlooking the ancient town a little distance away.



51
On the south side of the pillar is a Sanskrit inscription dating the dedication to around 484 A.D.



52
Other sides of the pillar have some interesting carvings as well.



53



54
Torana
Just in front of the presumed original entrance of the Vahara Temple with the shell script lies what is believed to be the remains of a torana (Hindu arched gateway). Cunningham searched for broken parts of the pillars, but only found a few broken statues and most of the torana pillars had long gone.

58
Temple Remains
Just in front of the Narasimha Temple is a curious structure consisting of four pillars set in the middle of a rectangular plinth. On further inspection these would appear to be random pieces of temple architecture that have been collected and placed in this way. Certainly from Cunningham’s map of the temple site there is no evidence of a temple existing exactly where this ‘structure’ is.



59
These show some equisit carvings, I guess having them still on site for people to see but fixed in this way is perhaps the best way of preserving them.

Eran is a wonderful place to visit; a cluster of immensely interesting temples set within a compact site, located in a relatively remote location. I’d be surprised if you find anyone else there if you visit, and it makes the whole experience all the more special because of that.

ASI Monument Number N-MP-236
Heritage Society February 24, 2020 ·
Eran is an ancient town in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh, India.
The original town of Eran no longer exists, its place being taken by a tiny village called Pahlezpur. Walking around the village it was fascinating to see heritage everywhere. A doorjamb here, a stone embedded into a wall there, an idol elsewhere - the place was absolutely littered with antiquities.
It was one of the ancient mints for Indian dynasties as evidenced by the diverse coins excavated here. The site has 5th-century Gupta era temples and monuments, particularly the colossal stone boar with sages and scholars depicted on the body of the sculpture.
The Mauryas, The Sungas,The Satvahanas,The Shakas,The Nagas,The Guptas, The Hunas, The Kalchuries, The Chandellas and The Parmaras had their hold over Eran region respectively. The Gupta monarch Samudra Gupta visited Eran which was his 'Swabhog Nagar'.
A group of Temples is situated on the south bank of Bina river, just half a kms. to the west of the Village. In this group Vishnu Temple, Varaha Temple, Narasimha Temple, Garuda Pillar and other ruined Temples are of architectural importance.
Eran is as remote as a heritage site can be. Nor is it a closed site. Every year, during and after the monsoon when the rains disturb the soil, a coin or two appears on the surface. This is what makes Eran very special and keeps archaeologists, historians and explorers excited. So if you do go to Eran, keep your eyes wide open. You never know what you may find.

Vishnu Temple at Eran, Sagar, MP - Built during Gupta dynasty 4th to 5th Century AD Varaha Temple at Khajuraho
The Varaha Temple at Khajuraho enshrines a colossal monolithic image of Lord Varaha, the boar incarnation of Lord Vishnu. This temple depicts Varaha as a purely animal form.
Lord Vishnu appeared in the form of a Boar in order to defeat Hiranyaksha, a demon who had taken the Earth (Prithvi) and carried it to the bottom of what is described as the cosmic ocean



71
in the story. The battle between Varaha and Hiranyaksha is believed to have lasted for a thousand years, which the former finally won. Varaha carried the Earth out of the ocean between his tusks and restored it to its place in the universe. Vishnu married Prithvi (Bhudevi) in this avatar.
Within the shrine is a superb highly polished freestanding sandstone carving of the boar Varaha, the third of Vishnu’s ten avatars. This massive boar, over 2.5m in length, was carved out of a single piece of rock.
The Varaha Temple is in fact one of the oldest temples in the compound, believed to have been constructed around 900 – 925 A.D. Who instigated its construction remains unclear, some think it may have been the Chandella king Yashovarman, in order to celebrate his victory over his Pratihara overlord.
The shrine consists of an oblong pavilion with a pyramidal roof of receding tiers resting on fourteen plain pillars. The flat ceiling is carved with a lotus flower, often seen in the hand of the God Vishnu.



72



73
Varaha is depicted in art as either purely animal or as being anthropomorphic, having a boar’s head on a man’s body. A fantastic early example of the latter can be found at Udayagiri Caves.
On the surface of the boar are 675 miniature figures, carved in twelve neat rows. These figures represent many of the important Gods and Goddesses of the Hindu pantheon, in part because the boar itself embodies all beings.
The carving also at one point included the image of the Earth Goddess, but today all that remains are her feet on the pedestal below along with a penitent serpent.

Eran – A Lost Monumental Legacy
July 14, 2011 Saurabh Saxena
Eram – A Lost Monumental Legacy
Introduction – Eran (ऐरण), a small village, is situated at the south bank of river Bina, a tributary of river Betwa. Eran enjoys the status being one among the most ancient towns in India. In ancient times, the town was known as Airikina, Erakaina and Erakanya as evident from the epigraphs and coins discovered here. Eran was an important stop on an ancient route from the east towards Ujjain and from the north linking Mathura and Vidhisa19.
Alexander Cunningham was the first to notice the antiquities of the town and his account was published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal vol. clxxxi m 1847. He again visited the town during his tour in 1871-72 and this account was included in the seventh volume of his survey reports. He narrates a local legend, that assigns the foundation of the town to Raja Barat or Vairat. Bheem, a Pandava, during his exile came to this town. At the expiration of his terms of exile, he shot an arrow, named Kichak, in joy. This arrow, which was shot at a deer, instead hit the hoof of the cow, splitting that into two. However the cow survived, its wound healed immediately and since then the hoof of all cows became cloven. Witnessing



81
this event, the king came to know the real identinty to the sojourner. Bheem left his gada and his mother’s churning stick and erected his own statue and left the town1. The pillar standing at Eran was known as Bheem Gada, another shorter column as his mother’s churning stick and the status of Vishnu as Bheem Sen among the locals.

On the etymology of the name of the town, Cunningham quotes Wilson stating that ‘Eraka’ is a ‘a sort of grass of emollient and diluent properties’ thus the town may have been named from the prevalence of this particular grass2. Noticing the importance of the town, extensive excavations were carried out by K D Bajpai, under the auspices of University of Sagar, between 1960 and 1965. These excavations revealed various layers of settlement patterns taking back the history of the town to the second millennium BCE. On the basis of stratigraphy, Bajpai3 classified the periods of settlement as below
1. Period I (Chalcolithic) – BCE 2000 – BCE 700 2. Period II A (Early Historical) – BCE 700 – BCE 200 3. Period II B – BCE 200 – 1st century CE 4. Period III – 1st century – 6th century CE 5. Period IV (Late Medieval) – up to 1800 CE
The most important finding of the period I was a mud defense wall and its associated moat. This wall suggests that the residents of the town were confined within the boundary marked by this wall. This wall served two purposes for the residents, first it acted as a defense machinery as the town had the advantage of a natural barrier at its other three sides, being surrounded by river Bina. The second purpose this wall served was in form of a moat which



82
was used accommodate the access water in case of heavy rains, thus saving the town. The wall was 154 feet wide and 21 feet deep4.
Among the other significant findings, a circular lead piece bearing the name of king Indragupta, belonging to period II A is the most important. A hoard of 3,268 punch marked coins is am0ong the most significant finding belonging to Period II B. This hoard and finding of other large number of coins suggests that Eran would have served as a mint during that period. Bajpai5 tells that before the conquest of the Guptas, Eran served as a mint minting coins for the local Naga rulers. Later these mints served the Gupta rulers. One copper coin, bearing the name of king Dharmapala, is counted among the earliest inscribed Indian coins, assigned to third century BCE6. An important finding of Period III is a clay seal depicting Gaja-Lakshmi icon with a Brahmi inscription.

The early history of the town can be satisfactorily traced from the time of the Sakas. Eran witnessed at least two foreign invasions, that of the Sakas and Hephthalite (might be taken synonymous with the Hunas of Sanskrit). During the start of the Christian era till the middle of the fourth century CE, Eran seems to be under the rule of the Sakas and their kshatrapas as evident from a clay seal inscription which mentions Saka kshatrapa Isvaramitra and his son Simhasrisena7. On the basis of paleography, the date of Simhasrisena cannot be taken beyond 350 CE. It was the Gupta king Samudragupta who would have wrestled this territory from the hands of the Sakas as attested by his inscription found at Eran. The Saka king ousted by Samudragupta, in all probability, would be Balavarma8.
Though Samudragupta was successful against the Sakas, however that success was not of a permanent nature. After Samudragupta, his sons and successors, Ramagupta and Chadragupta



83
II, continued their battle against the Sakas. Finally, it was Chandragupta II Vikramaditya who is credited as the exterminator of the Sakas, taking the title ‘Sakari’. Ramagupta and Chadragupta II would have spent considerable time at Eran as evident from the variety and volume of their coins found at the site. Bajpai9 suggests that the episode of a Saka king demanding the hand of the wife of Ramagupta, Dhruvadevi, may have happened at Eran as we find inscriptions of the Sakas as well as of the Guptas here. Therefore Eran would be the place where the Sakas were exterminated by the Gupta king Chandragupta II.
Within the Gupta period, Eran was subjected to a foreign invasion once again, and this time it was the Hephthalites (Hunas of Sanskrit) who invaded the town during the waning period of the Gupta authority. An inscription found in Eran mentions Toramana as maharajadhiraja and is dated to his first year of reign. This inscription, on a stone Varaha, refers to the erection of a temple by a Brahman named Dhanyavishnu. The same Brahman is mentioned, along with his brother as the reigning king, in another inscription where the brothers, jointly, erected a Vishnu-pillar, in year 165 of the Gupta era, corresponding 484 CE, referring to the Gupta king Budhagupta. As this pillar inscription does not mention Toramana, therefore it is assumed that Toramana captured Eran after 484 CE, probably around 500 CE10.
However, Toramana enjoyed this possession for a very short period of time. Another inscription at Eran, dated year 191 of the Gupta Era, corresponding 510 CE, mentions the Gupta king Bhanugupta fought a battle though it does not mention with whom this battle was fought. This battle might be fought against the Huna king Toramana either to defend against his invasion or to wrestle back the Gupta territories taken by him. Most probably it might be the case of recapturing the lost territories as from an another inscription the Aulikara king, Prakashadharma, we come to know that he routed Toramana in about 515 CE11.
After the Guptas, the history of the town went into obscurity till the thirteenth century CE when we find many sati stones being erected in the town. More than ten such stones have been reported. Later the town went into the Mughal rule.

Epigraphs
1. Stone inscription of Samudragupta – Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol III written in Sanskrit – undated – This stone inscription was found by Alexander Cunningham near the Varaha temple – The inscription mentions the Gupta king Samudragupta who is compared with Dhanada (Kubera) and Antaka (Yama) in joy and wrath respectively. A mention of setting up a temple of Janardana at Airikina to augment his own glories. 2. Pillar inscription of Budhagupta – Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol III – written in Sanskrit -dated in year 165 of the Gupta Era (484-85 CE) – The inscription opens with a verse in praise of Vishnu whose ensign is Garuda. Then we are told that when one hundred and sixty five years had elapsed and when Budhagupta was the lord of the earth and when Surasmichandra was a protector of people protecting the province intervening between the Kalindi (Yamuna) and Narmada, this dhvja-stambha of Bhagwan Janardana was caused to be erected by the Maharaja Matrivishnu and his younger brother Dhanyavishnu, son of Harivishnu, grandson of Varunavishnu and above all the great-grandson of Indravishnu, the Brahmana sage, who was the head of the Maitrayaniya school of Yajurveda and performed sacrifices. 3. Inscription on the neck of the boar – Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum (Fleet’s edition) Vol III – written in 8 lines in Sanskrit in Brahmi script – dated in the first reign of Toramana – The object of the inscription is to record the building of the temple in



85
which the present Varaha statue stands, by Dhanyavishnu, the younger brother of the deceased Maharaja Matrivishnu. 4. Stone pillar inscription of Bhanugupta – Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol III written in Sanskrit – dated in year 191 of the Gupta Era (510-11 CE) – This 2.5 feet tall linga was found by Cunningham12 on a high mound named Dana Bir. It was turned into a Shivalinga and was under worship when found – The inscription does not mention any reign of any particular king but mentions a certain Bhanugupta who might be not be sovereign but some king of the Gupta family. The object is nonsectarian and mentions that in company of Bhanugupta, who was a great ruler, his chieftain Goparaja came to Eran and fought a battle with the Maitras, and that Goparaja was killed, and that his wife accompanied him, by cremating herself on his funeral pyre, apparently near the place where the pillar was setup. This is probably the earliest record of Sati tradition. Goparaja is stated as the daughter’s son of the Sarabha king. 5. On the same pillar as no 2 – this another inscription on the same pillar refers to the Saka prince, Sridharavarman. His commander Satyanaga is said to be a resident of Maharashtra.
6. Inscription on a small varaha statue, now in Sagar University – Descriptive List of
Inscriptions in The Central Provinces and Berar – written in Sanskrit – undated, dated to 5th century CE on paleographic studies – This Nr-Varaha image was found by Cunningham in possession of a local Brahman in Eran who told the former that the image was brought from the location of the Buddhagupta pillar. A short inscription near the pedestal reads two names, Mahesvara-datta and Varaha-datta, apparently two brothers who caused the statue to be made. 7. Circular lead piece13 – script Mauryan Brahmi – inscribed ‘Rano Indagutasa’ 8. Gajalakshmi clay seal14 – script Brahmi – reads ‘Airikine Gomika Visha(ya)’ translating the seal of the officer of Gomika vishaya of Airikina 9. A clay seal14 – Gupta Brahmi characters – read ‘Mahadandanayaka Simhanandi’ translating Simhanandi, a mahadandanayaka 10. Another clay seal14 – Brahmi characters – reads ‘Isvaramitraputrasya rajno Simhasrisenasya’ translating King Simhasrisena, son of king Isvaramitra
Monuments – All the monuments of principal antiquities are located within one complex. There are remains of four-five temples, three main temples standing in single line in north to south direction.
Varaha (courtesy – Universitat Wien, The Countenance of the Other Project)
Varaha Temple – Though once this statue would be inside a small temple however now its stands below an open sky. The Varaha statue at Eran is the most ancient specimen of its kind. Varaha at Ramtek might be slightly earlier than that of Eran, however the one at Ramtek is very simple representation of zoomorphic form and not the ornamented as found in later period. Varaha in its zoomorphic form is known as Yajna Varaha representing the yajna (sacrifice) with its aahutis (offerings) in an animated form.
This varaha image measures about 14 feet in length, 5 feet in width and 11 feet in height15 making it the biggest such statue in India. The Varaha faces west and is ornamented with 1185 figures of sages, arranged in twelve rows, carved all over his body including legs, neck, forehead and throat16.



86
Varaha (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
Let us have a look on various figures found on this Varaha. A figure of Bhudevi is shown hanging with the right tusk of Varaha. A female figure, her hands on her waist, is standing in sambhanga posture at the snout of the Varaha. Rangarajan identifies her with Sarasvati while Becker17 identifies her with Vac, goddess of speech. I would be going with Sarasvati as we find the Sarasvati images on the snouts of the Varahas at Khajuraho and Dudhai.



87
Varaha with a garland of Hindu zodiac signs
In the ears are found Vidhyadharas. A garland of twenty-eight circles is shown around the neck of the Varaha. A male and a female figure is present inside the twenty-seven circles, while one circle has a figure of a scorpion. Rangarajan suggests that these twenty-seven circles represent the those number of Hindu Zodiac signs, while the scorpion figure suggests that the figure of Varaha was installed during Vrschik Rashi period, which is an auspicious time for such activities.
Four rows of male figures are shown across the throat and chest area. There are total of ninety-six figures, except the one, all are two-armed sages holding a water pot in one hand. Between the first and the second row, from top, in middle is an image of Vishnu, who is shown standing on a lotus. He is shown with two hands, but both hands are broken. Rangarajan suggests that he might be holding a gada (club) and chakra (discus). This is also the opinion of Becker.



88
Varaha chest with seven planets including Surya
The third row on the chest shows seven male figures, the leftmost holding two lotus in his hand and wearing a tunic while the rest holding a water vessel. These are identified with the Saptagrhas (seven plantes) by Joanna Williams17. Stephen Merkel17 mentions that these Saptagrahas are the earliest representation of the seven planets. Rahu and Ketu are excluded



89
here as the early texts mentions only the seven planets. The tunic Surya is shown wearing suggests the foreign influence as also attested by the fact that the statue was installed during the rule of Toramana.
On the shoulders of the Varaha is a stump like protrusion which has four niches on its four sides. Rangarajan identifies the figures in the niches with Saumya Purusa (Vasudeva) on the west, Shiva on the south, Brahma on the north and Vishnu on the east. She quotes Ahirbudhnya Samhita, where these four figures are identified with four vyuhas of the supreme being, namely, Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradhyumna and Aniruddha. Joanna Williams17 suggests that this mound or stump on the Varaha’s back is a manifestation of Brahma and it might also represents a yupa or sacrificial post.



90
Sages of Janaloka on Varaha body
Twelve rows of figures, in shape of a U, are carved along the body of the Varaha. All the twelve rows have figures of two- armed sages, holding water vessel in one hand and one hand either in abhaya-mudra or in vismaya-mudra. Legs and tail of the Varaha is also decorated with rows of sages, six rows in forelegs and three rows in hind legs. Rangarajan is of opinion



91
that these various sages, arranged in different rows in different parts of Varaha, represents that sages of Janaloka, who witnessed the episode of Varaha rescuing Bhudevi from the depths of an ocean.
Becker points to the erection of this image during the rule of the Huna king Toramana. She digs deeper into the idea and the reason erecting a Vaishnavite symbol or image in the reign of a foreign ruler. Installing a Vaishnavite image, which may be taken as an association to the previous Gupta rulers, might have brought wrath from the new Huna rulers. Though Hunas are known as barbaric and tyrant tribe, Becker tells that Toramana appears to be somewhat a tolerant ruler.
Becker quotes Thakur who mentions that Toramana, a shrewd statesman and foresighted administrator tolerated various religions of his subjects in order to maintain his authority as ruler. Becker tells that the Sassanians used boar as a symbol of royal authority however she also tells that the Sassanian boar imagery cannot be linked to Toramana directly or to the style of the Eran boar except the suggestion that boar was used as a royal symbol during the fifth and sixth century CE in the west and central Asia.
The two points which come to my mind are, how the donor of this statue got aware that boar could also be used as a royal symbol for the new ruler. And second is whether Toramana did not get the reading of the inscription which eulogized Narayana, a Hindu god. I believe that theory that Toramana allow some religious freedom to his subjects is more favorable here rather than Dhanyavishnu, the donor of the statue, getting an idea of using boar as Varaha as well as the royal symbol of Toramana.

Vishnu Pillar
Vishnu Pillar – This dhvaja-stambha erected in the honor of god Janardana is about 47 feet high, resting on a pedestal of 13 feet square. It was known locally as Bhim Gada as told by Cunningham.The shaft is square at bottom and turns octagonal till the capital. Two lions, seated back to back, are carved on the abacus of the capital.



94
Garuda Capital (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
The capital of the pillar is made of two human images, standing back to back with a wheel in between, one facing east and other west. Cunningham tells that these figures were locally known as that of Rama and Lakshmana. Both the images represent Garuda. The one, facing east, shows Gardua holding a serpent in his hands which Bajpai18 takes as a representation of a crushing defeat of the Sakas under the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II. As Garuda is associated with serpents, as an enemy, it is not surprising to see him holding a serpent. Whether there is any political agenda behind this posture of course is a matter of conjecture.



95
Garuda capital of Vishnu pillar
As per an inscription, this pillar was erected by brothers Matrivishnu and Dhanyavishnu during the rule of the Gupta king Buddhagupta. Matrivishnu was referred as a king which suggests that he was ruling under the patronage of the Gupta emperors.



96
Narasimha Image (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
Narasimha Temple – This temple was probably only consisted of a sanctum and mandapa, former 12.5 feet long and about 9 feet wide as Cunningham mentiuons. Now only a damaged statue of Narasimha is what remains of this temple. It is broken below its knees, however its pedestal was in it situ when Cunningham visited. Now the pedestal is also lying on the platform. The pedestal has the remain of feet of Narasimha.



97
Narasimha
It would have been a 7 feet high statue in its original glory. The iconography is interesting as such this is a kevala-Narasimha image, shown standing but not in action. The mouth wide open shows an amiable appearance rather than the rudra aspect as witnessed in other icons.



98
Vishnu Temple (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
Vishnu Temple – This is the best preserved temple at the site. Though its roof is fallen however its sanctum doorway is intact with its decoration. Cunningham suggests that, when complete, it would have measured 32.5 feet long and 13.5 feet wide while its interior dimensions would be 18 feet by 6 feet. Two pillars, 13 feet high, still standing in front of the sanctum suggests that a roofed mandapa adorned the temple. Only the pillars have survived, the walls between are all fallen.



99
Sanctum Doorway

Vishnu (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
An image of Vishnu, 13 feet high, is placed inside the sanctum. This image was known as an image of Bhim Sen by the locals as mentioned by Cunningham. The sanctum doorway has river goddesses, Ganga and Yamuna, at the door jambs. Usually these river goddess are found at the upper part of the door jambs, at the terminals, in the Gupta period temples.



101
Krishna Deva20 seems to agree here stating that the sanctum doorway and the front mandapa was installed during the Pratihara period of 8th-9th century CE. Dvarpalas are present at the pilasters on either side of the door.
Food and Accommodation – Eran is a small village, you will not find any place to stay and eat. Mandi Bamora is the nearest big town, however that also does not offer good staying options. Best would be that you stay at Sanchi and visit Eran as a day trip from there. Mandi Bamora railway station and nearby area gives some options for food.
How to reach – Mandi Bamora is a railway station on Bhopal-Bina railway line. Eran is about 15 km far from here on eastern side. You can either ask some auto rickshaw or take lift from people going towards that village. There is no direct bus to Eran, buses going to Khurai will drop you at the crossing to Eran, from where it is about 5 kms.

Majholi – A Varaha Imprisoned
August 9, 2011 Saurabh Saxena



103
Introduction – Majholi is a small town near Jabalpur. Cunningham visited this town in 1873-74 and reported its antiquities. The town does not have many antiquarian remains except one exquisite Varaha image.
Monuments – There is only one temple of interest in this town.
Varaha inside the sanctum
Vishnu-Varaha Temple – This temple was visited and described by Cunningham in 187374. He reports that the temple was a modern construction but houses an eleventh century CE image of Varaha belonging to the Kalchuri period. The recent construction has utilized the material of the old shrine as many statues are inbuilt into the modern walls. The original temple would have been constructed during the eleventh century CE during the Kalchuri rule as evident from its architectural style.



104
Sanctum door
Sanctum door is in characteristic Kalchuri style. Ganga and Yamuna are present on door jambs while Vishnu with Nava-grahas adorn its lintel. Four-armed Vishnu is depicted seated in yogasana-mudra in middle of the lintel. The door-jambs have three bands, the middle one has three panels each. Apsaras in various postures are adorning these jamb panels.



105
Naga below Varaha
A huge Varaha image is installed inside a square sanctum. It is encased inside an iron cage which prohibits taking a good photograph of it. It is modeled on very similar Gupta and Chandella images seen at Eran and Khajuraho. A serpent is shown in between Varaha’s front legs. The serpent is shown holding a vessel while his wife is shown behind him. She is also holding a vessel in her hands. In between the snout of Varaha and hood of the serpent, there is an image of Vishnu in yogasana-mudra. Various gods, gandharvas, apsaras, rishis are shown all over the body of this Varaha. The statue needs proper cleaning due to prolonged use ash, vermilion and other similar objects over the image.
There are few loose sculptures built into the external wall of the sanctum. Images of Ganesha, Vaishnavi, Shiva-Parvati etc are seen on these walls, all probably coming from the original temple.
How to Reach – Majholi can be reached from Sihora which is located on Jabalpur-Katni road. Majholi is on Sihora-Ranital road and is about 27 km from Sihora town.

TORAMANA AND MIHIRAKULA - THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ALKHAN IN INDIA
Toramana and Mihirakula were the best known Hun kings in India, and a great deal of epigraphic evidence for both can be found there. Their coinage identifies them without a doubt as belonging to the Alkhan; yet their coinage is distanced stylistically from that of the Alkhan at the time of Khingila.
Inscriptions show that the Huns under Toramana pushed from Punjab into Central India; the southernmost point with an inscription from Toramana (Fig. B) was Eran in Malwa (540 km south of New Delhi), a region that brought the Alkhan into contention with the Gupta emperors. In an inscription set at Gwalior (on the edge of the Ganges plain, 280 km south of New Delhi) Mihirakula is identified as the son of Toramana. The coinage corroborates this, as the numerous overstrikes prove that Mihirakula at least ruled after Toramana (Nr. 5). In 520 CE on his journey to the Buddhist sites of India (Fig. C), the Chinese pilgrim Song Yun encountered a Hun king in Punjab who had been at war with the king of Kashmir for three years and who might be identifiable as Mihirakula. Before 532 CE Mihirakula suffered a devastating defeat against Yasodharman, king of Malwa, signaling the demise of the Alkhan in India (Fig. D). Around the middle of the 6th century CE, the Alkhan successively pulled out of Punjab and Gandhara and back to Kabulistan, where they encountered the Nezak kings (showcase 11). A political or dynastic connection between the Alkhan and the Nezak is made evident in a series of drachms produced in Gandhara which show the Alkhan king with the bull-head crown of the Nezak (Nos. 9–11). Nearly parallel to the Alkhan in Gandhara and India, the Hephthalites in Bactria met their demise when they were defeated by the allied Sasanian and Western Turks in around 560 CE (showcase 10).

C. Route of the Chinese monk Song Yun to the Buddhist sites of India, 518–522 CE. (© Shoshin Kawayama) While the Chinese monk Song Yun records the king of Uddiyana (Swat Valley) as a devout Buddhist, he describes the Hun king, whom he met during his travels in the year 520 CE in eastern Punjab, and who might possibly be identified as Mihirakula, as brutal and not believing in Buddhist teachings. Song Yun traveled through Tashkurgan (Xinjiang) and the Wakhan Corridor in the Pamir Mountains to Bactria (Tokharistan), where in the fall/winter of 519 CE he arrived at the court of the Hephthalite king in Baghlan, on the middle course of the Surkhab River. From there his path continued back to Zebak, across Chitral and the passes between Hindu Kush and Karakorum mountains to Uddiyana, and afterward to Gandhara and into the eastern Punjab (Jhelum).

Broad strap antarīya on Gardez Gaṇeśa pratimā is Indus Script hypertext to signify metals (iron) manufactory of Sarasvati civilization. Amarakośa provides a synonym for Gaṇeśa with the expression tri-dhātu, 'three minerals'.
The pratimā has vivid iconographic details to further elaborate on the metaphor of Gaṇeśa an iron smelter, a wealth-accounting ledger keeper, a scribe.
Gaṇeśa wears an unusual crown, shaped like a wicker basket. The rebus reading of the crown worn by Gaṇeśa is karaṇḍa hieroglyph करं डी karaṇḍī f (Dim. of करं डा) A little covered
basket of bamboo. karaṇḍa 'wicker-basket' rebus: करडा karaḍā 'Hard from alloy--iron, silver

(खरडणें) A hurriedly written or drawn piece; a scrawl; a mere tracing or rude



123
sketch.खरडा kharaḍā a day-book; a note-book. Thus, Gaṇeśa is keeper of a day-book, wealth-accounting ledger.
These metaphors are conveyed by the karaṇḍa-shaped mukuṭa 'crown' worn by Mahāvināyaka of Gardez. Elephant trunk: karibha, ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'; ib 'stylus' (as in English nib of stylus).
Gaṇeśa wears a yajñopavita, 'sacred thread' adorned with a cobra-hood:phaḍā'cobra hood'rebus phaḍā,paṭṭaḍe 'metals manufactory'. kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' kolhe 'smelter' kolle 'blacksmith. panja 'claw of beast, feline paw' rebus: panja 'kiln'.
Thousands of Gaṇeśa pratimā also show a mouse:mūṣa 'mouse' rebus: mūṣa 'crucible'. Thus, Gaṇeśa is an iron worker producing crucible steel. This metallurgical competence makes him the leader of the guild, ironworker guild-master, Mahāvināyaka.

Harappan chimaera and its hypertextual components. Harappan chimera and its hypertextual components. The 'expression' summarizes the syntax of Harappan chimeras within round brackets, creatures with body parts used in their correct anatomic position (tiger, unicorn, markhor goat, elephant, zebu, and human); within square brackets, creatures with body parts used to symbolize other anatomic elements (cobra snake for tail and human arm for elephant proboscis); the elephant icon as exonent out of the square brackets symbolizes the overall elephantine contour of the chimeras; out of brackes, scorpion indicates the animal automatically perceived joining the lineate horns, the human face, and the arm-like trunk of Harappan chimeras. (After Fig. 6 in: Harappan chimaeras as 'symbolic hypertexts'. Some thoughts on Plato, Chimaera and the Indus Civilization (Dennys Frenez & Massimo Vidale, 2012).
Dennys Frenez and Massimo Vidale focus attention on pictorial motifs and on m0300 seal, identify a number of hieroglyph components constituting the hieroglyph-multiplex -- on the pictorial motif of 'composite animal', seen are hieroglyph components (which they call hypertextual components): serpent (tail), scorpion, tiger, one-horned young bull, markhor, elephant, zebu, standing man (human face), man seated in penance (yogi).
The yogi seated in penance and other hieroglyphs are read rebus in archaeometallurgical terms: kamaDha 'penance' (Prakritam) rebus: kampaTTa 'mint'. Hieroglyph: kola 'tiger', xolA 'tail' rebus:kol 'working in iron'; kolle 'blacksmith'; kolhe 'smelter'; kole.l 'smithy'; kolimi 'smithy, forge'. खोड [khōṇḍa ] m A young bull, a bullcalf (Marathi) rebus: khond 'turner'. dhatu 'scarf' rebus: dhatu 'minerals'.bica 'scorpion' rebus: bica 'stone ore'. miṇḍāl markhor (Tor.wali) meḍho a ram, a sheep (Gujarati) Rebus:meḍ (Ho.); mẽṛhet ‘iron’ (Mu.Ho.) mẽṛhet iron; ispat m. = steel; dul m. = cast iron (Munda) kara'elephant's trunk' Rebus: khar 'blacksmith'; ibha 'elephant' rebus: ib 'iron'. Together: karaibā 'maker, builder'.
Use of such glosses in Meluhha speech can be explained by the following examples of vAkyam or speech expressions as hieroglyph signifiers and rebus-metonymy-layeredcipher yielding signified metalwork:
Example 1: mũh opening or hole (in a stove for stoking (Bi.); ingot (Santali) mũh metal ingot (Santali)mũh ã ̄ = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the



129
Kolhes; iron produced by the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each end; mūhā mẽṛhẽt= iron smelted by the Kolhes and formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each of four ends;kolhe tehen mẽṛhẽt ko mūhā akata = the Kolhes have to-day produced pig iron (Santali) kaula mengro‘blacksmith’ (Gypsy) mleccha-mukha (Samskritam) = milakkhu ‘copper’ (Pali) The Samskritam glossmleccha-mukha should literally mean: copper-ingot absorbing the Santali gloss, mũh, as a suffix.
Example 2: samṛobica, stones containing gold (Mundari) samanom = an obsolete name for gold (Santali) [bica ‘stone ore’ (Munda): meṛed-bica = iron stone ore, in contrast to bali-bica, iron sand ore (Munda)].
In addition to the use of hieroglyph-components to create hieroglyph-multiplexes of pictorial motifs such as 'composite animals', the same principle of multiplexing is used also on the socalled 'signs' of texts of inscriptions.

Hieroglyph: Joined animals (tigers): sangaḍi = joined animals (M.)

Rebus 2: sang संग् m. a stone (Kashmiri) sanghāḍo (G.) = cutting stone, gilding; sangatarāśū = stone cutter; sangatarāśi = stone-cutting; sangsāru karan.u = to stone (S.), cankatam = to scrape (Ta.), sankaḍa (Tu.), sankaṭam = to scrape (Skt.)
kol 'tiger' Rebus: kol 'working in iron'. Thus, the multi-headed tiger yields one reading: rebus: kol sangaḍi 'fortified place for metal (& ore stone) workers'.
Rebus 3: saMghAta 'caravan'
Thus, the three tigers together with wings reads: eraka kol saMghAta 'moltencast metal, iron worker caravan'.

My prayers to Gardez Four-armed, divine, MahāVināyaka. विनायक pl. N. of partic.
formulas recited over weapons (रामायण).
Inscription on the pedestal of the pratimā dates it to 5th cent.CE, the days of Shahi Khingala who consecrated the divine MahāVināyaka (Brown, Robert (1991), Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God, Albany: State University of New Yorkpp. 50–55, 120).. His two lower arms rest on two gaṇa-s; thus, he signifies that he is guild-master of a guild. The pratimā is from Sakar Dhar (formerly Shankar Dhar), North of Kabul and relocated to dargah Pir Rattan Nath at Kabul for worship. The inscription on the pedestal reads: ‘This great and beautiful Maha Vinayaka was consecrated by the renowned Shahi King, the illustrious Shahi Khingala.’ (Shakunthala Jagannathan and Nanditha Krishna, Ganesha...The Auspicious... The Beginning, Mumbai, 1992, p. 55.)

Broad strap antarīya on Gardez Gaṇeśa pratimā is Indus Script hypertext to signify metals (iron) manufactory of Sarasvati civilization. Amarakośa provides a synonym for Gaṇeśa with the expression tri-dhātu, 'three minerals'.
The pratimā has vivid iconographic details to further elaborate on the metaphor of Gaṇeśa an iron smelter, a wealth-accounting ledger keeper, a scribe.
Gaṇeśa wears an unusual crown, shaped like a wicker basket. The rebus reading of the crown worn by Gaṇeśa is karaṇḍa hieroglyph करं डी karaṇḍī f (Dim. of करं डा) A little covered
basket of bamboo. karaṇḍa 'wicker-basket' rebus: करडा karaḍā 'Hard from alloy--iron, silver
&38' A similar sounding word signifies that Gaṇeśa is a scribe, writer: खरड kharaḍa f
(खरडणें) A hurriedly written or drawn piece; a scrawl; a mere tracing or rude
sketch.खरडा kharaḍā a day-book; a note-book. Thus, Gaṇeśa is keeper of a day-book, wealth-accounting ledger.
These metaphors are conveyed by the karaṇḍa-shaped mukuṭa 'crown' worn by Mahāvināyaka of Gardez. Elephant trunk: karibha, ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'; ib 'stylus' (as in English nib of stylus).
Gaṇeśa wears a yajñopavita, 'sacred thread' adorned with a cobra-hood:phaḍā'cobra hood'rebus phaḍā,paṭṭaḍe 'metals manufactory'. kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' kolhe 'smelter' kolle 'blacksmith. panja 'claw of beast, feline paw' rebus: panja 'kiln'.
Thousands of Gaṇeśa pratimā also show a mouse:mūṣa 'mouse' rebus: mūṣa 'crucible'. Thus, Gaṇeśa is an iron worker producing crucible steel. This metallurgical competence makes him
the leader of the guild, ironworker guild-master, Mahāvināyaka.

The Coin Galleries: Alchon Huns
Our knowledge of the various Hunnic tribes is still quite uncertain but is evolving. In his seminal four-volume study of Hunnic coins (Dokumente zur Geschichte der Iranischen Hunnen in Baktrien und Indien), Robert Göbl identified four major series of coins and divided them into four separate "tribes" or phases: the Kidarites, the Alchon Huns, the



142
Nezak Huns and the "proper" Hephthalites. Certainly these four major groupings seem logical based on style and typology, so numismatists continue to use them.
The earliest coins of the Alchon Huns seem to date from very late in the fourth century, as they actually use dies of the Sasanian emperor Shapur II (ruled 309- 379), recut to reflect their name (Alchono) and their symbol: the so-called "bull" tamgha. Subsequently, they cut fresh dies of this type and the first coin shown below is one of these, with the bull tamgha in the right field of the obverse. What followed is a matter of some dispute, and I will discuss the issues as I present the coins.
A key development in our knowledge of these coins came in 2006. In his study, Göbl had not made much progress in creating a sequence for the coins, as they just didn't seem to follow a pattern. In 2006, Gudrun Melzer published a reading and translation of a copper scroll inscription from the Schøyen collection that fundamentally changed the outlook. In this inscription, four separate kings who we know from the coins are named as donors in the establishment of a Buddhist stupa. So we now realize that these four kings: Khingila, Toramana, Javukha and Mehama, were all ruling at the same time and therefore were issuing coins in parallel. No wonder the coins didn't seem to follow a logical sequence! More details will emerge in the ensuing discussion.
This page presents the anonymous coins of the early Alchons, and then, on succeeding pages, I will present what seem to me to be the logical four series that might have followed these coins, centering on the four kings mentioned in the Schøyen copper scroll inscription published by Melzer.

Early Alchon Coins
Imitation Shapur II silver drachm
Crowned bust of king right, "bull" tamgha before, Bactrian legend at right: alchono / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 4.15 gm, Diameter: 30 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 36
This rare type features the first freshly cut dies imitating the coinage of Shapur II. Apart from the tribal name alchono in Bactrian script, it features the "bull" tamgha which seems to have been a key symbol of the tribe. Göbl argued that the tamgha shows the horns of a bull mounted on a stand. Most, but not all, Alchon coins carry it. I personally do not find this identification persuasive; instead, I believe the tamgha represents a lunar crescent on a stand. As we will see, the lunar crescent became the chief ornament on Alchon crowns, so clearly this symbol was an important one for them.
Anonymous Coins with Alchon Bust



144
Anonymous silver drachm, c. late 4th or early 5th century
Bare-headed bust of king right, wearing pearl necklace with double ribbons, "bull" tamgha before, crescent moon above left, Brahmi letter tha? at left, Bactrian legend at right: alchono /
Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.84 gm, Diameter: 30 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 41
The next phase of Alchon coinage was still anonymous, naming only the clan "Alchon," but now featuring a distinctly Alchon bust with a tall head representing the skull deformation practiced by the tribe. The bust was not crowned and so there was no diadem with its trailing ribbon ends. Instead, the bust is shown wearing a necklace with trailing ribbons. This may be an indication that the die cutters misunderstood the Sasanian drachms on which these coins were based ... on the Sasanian coins, the king always wore a diadem with trailing ribbbons, but there was normally a large hair bun behind the head and the ribbons floated above this. It was sometimes unclear where the ribbons were attached and the Alchon celators may have thought it was at the necklace.
This coin has an interesting feature. If you look carefully (click on the image for an enlargement), you can see that the ribbon ends have been carved twice. At first, they were more vertical and right up against the left border of the coin and probably continuing up beyond where the crescent is now. My guess is that the die cutter first forgot to leave space for the crescent and had to recut the ribbons in order to make room for it. Alternatively, the coin was first designed without a crescent and the crescent was a later addition. Among all known coins of this period, however, none has lacked the crescent, so the first explanation is the more likely one.



145
Anonymous silver drachm, c. late 4th or early 5th century
Bare-headed bust of king right, wearing pearl necklace with double ribbons, "bull" tamgha before, crescent moon above left, Brahmi letter shi (sri?) at left, Bactrian legend at right: alchono /
Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.53 gm, Diameter: 29 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 43
This coin shows the same sort of ribbon ends as the previous coin, but a different Brahmi letter behind the king's bust ... perhaps shi and intended to be sri. Many Hun coins from Sind feature a prominent sri on them.
Anonymous silver drachm, c. late 4th or early 5th century

Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.63 gm, Diameter: 27.5 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 43
Göbl doesn't distinguish between this coin and the previous one, but the depiction of the ribbon ends is distinctly different: here the ribbon ends are kept separate and arranged vertically as narrow cylinders as opposed to the previous two coins where the ribbon ends are almost joined together to form a triangular shape. What exactly is the significance of this difference is not clear. They are not clearly separated in time as coins of the Sasanian kings of the late 4th and early 5th centuries show both of these ribbon ends. They at least represent the hand of different die cutters, and perhaps of different mints.

The anonymous series of Alchon coins included some rare copper coins as well. These were very unusual in that there was a bust on both sides. One thing we learn from these coins is that the Hun mint masters were perfectly capable of minting coins with clear designs on both sides ... why their silver coins always had obliterated reverses remains a mystery.
The Coin Galleries: Khingila
(and followers)
Khingila is the first of the four kings mentioned on the Schøyen copper scroll inscription and therefore may have been the eldest or seniormost among them. Traditionally, Khingila is regarded as the Alchon king who started to make serious inroads into India, but there is no definitive evidence of this ... it is just that he was one of the few kings whose name could be read on the coins. Göbl thought Khingila was Toramana's father, which we now know from the copper scroll is almost certainly not true. Had there been any relationship



147
between them, the scroll would surely have mentioned this, as a number of other familial relationships are documented in it. Also, Göbl assigned many coin types to Khingila, but this was more a reflection of his inability to definitively assign them to anyone else. Nevertheless, the earliest Khingila coins seem very close to the early anonymous types seen on the last page and, combining this with Khingila's primary position in the copper scroll list, it seems reasonable to list his coins first. Perhaps his rule did start first and perhaps he did make some conquests in Gandhara.
In what follows below, I provide listings of coins that are definitvely Khingila's and then list some coins that seem to follow his stylistically. This would form the first of the four sequences of coins stemming from the early anonymous types of the previous page.
Khingila
Khingila silver drachm, c. mid-5th century
Bare-headed bust of king right, "bull" tamgha at left, Bactrian legend at right: khigi / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.45 gm, Diameter: 25 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 57
The earliest Khingila coins follow directly from the anonymous types with the separated ribbon ends attached to the necklace. The differences are (1) that the bull/lunar tamgha has migrated from the right to the left (replacing the crescent, thereby suggesting that the "bull" tamgha may be a misnomer ... perhaps it should be seen as a crescent tamgha), and (2) the space previously occupied at right by the tamgha now carries a Brahmi legend that reads khigi (for Khingila). A further difference occurs on the reverse: here, instead of the flames seen emerging from the fire altar in previous coin types, a bust, normally thought to be that of Ahura Mazda, is seen emerging from the top of the altar.
Khingila silver drachm, c. mid-5th century
Bare-headed bust of king right, "bull" tamgha at left, Bactrian legend at right: khaga / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.46 gm, Diameter: 24.5 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 57
The celator left out the vowel diacritics on this example, rendering the name khaga instead of khigi (for Khingila).



148
Khingila copper unit, c. mid-5th century Bare-headed bust of king right, Bactrian legend at right: khaga / Saced vase (kalasha), flanked by Brahmi legend: khi / ngi
Weight: 1.22 gm, Diameter: 13-14 mm., Die axis: 12 o'clock Ref: Göbl 54
As in the case of the anonymous coins, Khingila issued small copper coins that had well-executed (not obliterated) reverses at a 12 o'clock die axis, rather than the 3 o'clock die axes on all the silver coins.
Khingila silver drachm, c. mid-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends "fly-whisk" shoulder ornaments, "bull" tamgha at right, Bactrian legend above: left: khiggilo, right: alchono / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.66 gm, Diameter: 30 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 61
A magnificent coin type with a beautiful, bold portrait and a number of innovations. The most important one is that the king is now crowned: he wears a diadem with hanging ribbon ends and a crescent forehead ornament. There are no ribbons attached to the necklace any more. The bull tamgha has made its way back to the right to accommodate the hanging ribbons in the left field. The king's name is now rendered in Bactrian: khiggilo (not very visible on this specimen because of the flatness between 9 and 11 o'clock). The Bactrian legend alchono has also made its way back ... here from 1 to 5 o'clock. Finally, a strange aspect is the appearance of the "fly-whisk" shoulder ornaments. We don't know their significance ... one theory is that they represent divinity in the way it was often represented by shoulder flames on Kushan coins. The reverse once again has flames emanating from the fire altar.



149
Khingila ? silver drachm, c. mid-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends "fly-whisk" shoulder ornaments, "bull" tamgha at left, solar disc at right, Bactrian legend above: left: ???, right: alchono / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 2.80 gm, Diameter: 27 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 70
The attribution of this coin is uncertain ... Göbl read the legend at left as a retrograde shoyo and suggested an attribution to Khingila, but he attributed almost all problematic Alchon coins to that king. Nevertheless, it seems to me the coin is probably an issue of Khingila as it is clearly related to the previous coin and also to the next coin, previously unpublished, that does seem to have been issued by Khingila.
Khingila ? silver drachm, c. mid-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends "fly-whisk" shoulder ornaments, "bull" tamgha at left, solar disc at right, Brahmi legend at left: khinkila, Bactrian at right: alchono /
Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.51 gm, Diameter: 28 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl --- (unpublished variant of G 70)
This coin, previously unpublished, appears to be an evolution from the previous one. The style is finer, but it retains the previous coin's fly-whisk shoulder ornaments, the bull/lunar tamgha at left, the solar disc at right, and the Bactrian legend alchono at top right. However, it inserts a Brahmi legend at top left that is somewhat difficult to read, but I believe reads khinkila. This is a known variant spelling of Khingila's name. This coin and the previous one form a "bridge" between the previous coin and the next coin, both of which are definitvely Khingila issues.Specifically, they retain the "fly-whisk" ornaments of the previous coin (not seen on coins definitively assigned to any ruler other than Khingila), but introduce the solar disc in the right field, which is seen on the next coin. Stylistically, this coin has a close affinity to the next coin.



150
Khingila silver drachm, c. mid-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends lunar crescents on shoulders, "bull" tamgha at left, solar disc at right, Brahmi legend above: left: devashahi, right: khingila / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.59 gm, Diameter: 28 mm., Die axis: ? o'clock Ref: Göbl 81
Khingila's "final" issues evolve from the previous coin. They retain the tamgha at left and solar disc at right and the crescented diadem with the hanging ribbons, but then introduce a couple of significant changes. First, the "fly-whisk" shoulder ornaments are replaced by lunar crescents, probably to still emphasize the king's divinity, and the legend is now in Brahmi: devashahi khingila.

Another example of the previous type.
"Raja Lakhana"
"Raja Lakhana" silver drachm, c. late-5th century Crowned bust of king right, with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends lunar crescents on shoulders, "bull" tamgha at left, trident at right, Bactrian legend above left: alchono, Brahmi legend above right: raja lakhana / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.67 gm, Diameter: 28 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 80



151
Stylistically, this coin type seems to be related to the late Khingila drachms, with a trident replacing the solar disc in the right field. Here though there are both a Bactrian legend (alchono) and a Brahmi legend raja lakhana, which seem to be translations of one another and just represent a title. The king may be Udayaditya, whose coins are shown next. The coin forms a bridge between the previous coins of Khingila and those of Udayaditya. Like the Khingila coins, it features the bull/lunar tamgha at left, lunar crescents on the shoulders, and an additional symbol (trident instead of the solar disc) at right. But it introduces the title subsequently used by Udayaditya.
Udayaditya

Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.63 gm, Diameter: 28 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 79
On this coin, we have a name: Udayaditya, and his title: raja lakhana,. which connects this coin to the previous one. However, the trident and, surprisingly, the tamgha, from the previous type have disappeared ... there are no symbols, not even the lunar shoulder crescents. All of the open space on the coin have been given over to the title and name. But this type appears to follow in the Khingila series.

152
This example has quite a distinct portrait.

Yet another portrait style, very similar to that on the next coin.
"Shahi Javuvla"
"Shahi Javuvla" silver drachm, c. late-5th century or early 6th century

Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.52 gm, Diameter: 27 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 82
Vondrovec has assigned this coin to Javukha, but without any justification or explanation that I could find. Stylistically, it has absolutely nothing in common with the known coins of Javukha. Rather, it seems to follow closely the coins of Udayaditya. Initially, I was tempted to attribute this to Toramana for two reasons. First, the coin uses the word jayatu, which was also used on Toramana's and Mihirakula's coins. Second, in the Kura inscription, Toramana is
referred to as mahararaja-toramana- shahi-jauvla. For both these reasons, an attribution to Toramana seems plausible. Indeed, P.L. Gupta, in his book Coins does assign this coin to Toramana, again without any explanation. However, the coin is stylistically so similar to the Udayaditya coins, it seems more reasonable to assign it to a king following Udayaditya, perhaps Udayaditya himself. The word jauvla or javuvla seems to be a title and another



153
king could well have adopted it, as they could have adopted the use of the word jayatu. Overall, the attribution of this coin is an open question. One other interesting aspect of this coin worth pointing out is the prominent hoop ear-ring ... the only Hun coin type to feature this, rather than the usual double drop ear-rings.
The Coin Galleries: Toramana and Mihirakula
Toramana is the second king mentioned in the Schøyen copper scroll inscription, so his coins (and coins related to his) are presented next. From the historian's point of view, Toramana is perhaps the most important Alchon king, because he is the first one about whom we have a fair bit of information from sources other than coins. We know from an inscription dated in year 1 from Eran in central India (Madhya Pradesh) that he was ruling there at the start of his reign and we also have an inscription from Kura in the Salt Range in the Punjab, naming him as mahararaja- toramana-shahi-jauvla. These inscriptions suggest to me that he inherited a substantial kingdom reaching from northwestern Punjab to central India. We then have later literary evidence of him waging war against the Guptas and installing a king in Magadha. Finally, the Gwalior Fort inscription names him as the father of Mihirakula.
Until now, the only coins known of Toramana are copper coins (see below) and small silver drachms based on the Gupta madhyadesha types (also see below). Vondrovec had left Toramana out of his analysis of the implications of the Schøyen inscription because there was no known silver coin of his on the Sasanian model. However, listed below is one such coin. This gives us a huge boost in our ability to understand the Alchon coinage.
Mihirakula must have inherited a sizeable kingdom, but it appears he lost most of it. An inscription in Mandasor proclaims that he was defeated by Yashodharman, and accounts in the Rajatarangini tell us he was forced to flee to Kashmir, where the king gave him refuge. However, he turned against his host and usurped power there.
Precursor to Toramana ?
"Shahi" silver drachm, c. late-5th century
Bare-headed bust of king right, ribbon ends attached to necklace, no "bull" tamgha, Brahmi legend at left: shahi / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.40 gm, Diameter: 28 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 69
This coin type is normally assigned to Khingila, but I would like to suggest the possibility that this was a precursor to Toramana's coinage. The reason? It lacks



154
the "bull"/lunar tamgha, which is present on all of Khingila's coinage (and also that of Javukha and Mehama, as we will see), but which is absent on the coins of Toramana and Mihirakula. Thus it could form a bridge from the early anonymous coins to the later named ones. Of course, this suggestion is highly tentative.
Toramana

Bare-headed bust of king right, wearing necklace with ribbon ends, Brahmi letter at right: bu or bra, dotted border around / Solar disc in upper register, Brahmi legend below: tora, dotted border around Weight: 3.16 gm, Diameter: 22 mm., Die axis: 12 o'clock Ref: Göbl 120
I present first some copper coins of Toramana, because these seem closely related to the anonymous coins of the early Alchon period. Note the tall-headed bust with no diadem, the ribbon ends being attached to the necklace instead, as on the early Alchon coins. Note, however, the absence of the "bull"/lunar tamgha. On the reverse, we have a very Gupta style design, with a symbol above and the king's name below. Compare to the first copper coin on the Chandragupta II page. The important conclusion we can draw from these coins is that Toramana's coinage drew its inspiration partly from Gupta coins, but otherwise directly from the early anonymous coins, not from the coins of Khingila. This reinforces the insight gained from the Schøyen copper scroll, that Khingila and Toramana (and, indeed, Javukha and Mehama also) ruled in parallel rather than in sequence.

Toramana ? silver drachm, c. early-6th century
Crowned bust of king right, wearing diadem with crescent forehead ornament land hanging ribbon ends, unar crescents on shoulders, solar disc at right, conch at left, Brahmi legend above: jayatu torana, dotted border around / Large fire altar flanked by attendants, dotted border around Weight: 3.59 gm, Diameter: 27.5 mm., Die axis: 10 o'clock Ref: Göbl --- (unpublished)
This previously unpublished coin may be the first known Sasanian style silver drachm of Toramana. The reading of the legend is not absolutely definitive because of the state of the coin. jayatu is clear. The next letter is either to or bha, followed by ra. The following letter is partially obscured, but appears to be a hard na. Thus the legend on the coins appears to read jayatu torana or jayatu bharana. So the question is, whose coin is this?
I believe there is a strong possibility that the coin is of Toramana. It is possible that the intended legend was jayatu toramana and that the celator accidentally omitted the letter ma, or intentionally left it out seeing that he was out of space. Other aspects of the coin make it very consistent with this attribution. There are two important connections between this coin and the known copper coins of Toramana, shown above. First, the prominent symbol is a solar disc; second, there is no "bull"/lunar tamgha, an absolute necessity on all other Alchon coinage, but missing here and on Toramana's copper coins. Further, it is worth remembering that Toramana's name is shortened to tora on the copper coins. So, for these reasons, the coin appears to be connected to Toramana's copper coins. In addition,



156
there is a close similarity between this coin and the wellknown silver drachms of Mihirakula (shown below). The portrait styles are very similar on the two types, they both feature two prominent symbols (left and right), and they both feature a legend that passes continuously over the king's head, something not seen on any coin of Khingila, Javukha or Mehama. Further, the legend includes the word jayatu, as do the coins of Mihirakula. Since we know Mihirakula was Toramana's son, we would expect his coins to resemble his father's in design and style. So once again we have strong evidence favoring the attribution of this coin to Toramana.

o'clock): vijitavaniravanipati sri toramana divam jayati Weight: 2.49 gm, Diameter: n.a., Die axis: n.a. Ref: Göbl 119
Toramana also issued silver drachms modeled on the madhyadesa types of the Guptas, with a similar legend, but placing the head facing left instead of right. Compare this coin with the madhyadesa types
of Skandagupta. (photo courtesy Shailendra Bhandare)
Mihirakula
Mihirakula silver drachm, c. early-6th century
Crowned bust of king right, wearing diadem with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends, lunar crescents on shoulders, ribboned trident at right, sun standard at left, Brahmi legend above: jayatu mihirakula, dotted border around Fire altar flanked by attendants, dotted border around Weight: 3.33 gm, Diameter: 25 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 310
We know from the Gwalior Fort inscription that Mihirakula was Toramana's son and this coin provides corroboration of that fact: it is clearly derived from the previous coin of Toramana. I have already commented on the close similarities between the two coins. Note that the dominant symbol on Toramana's coin, the solar disc,



157
is represented horizontally here as the top of the standard at left.
Mihirakula silver drachm, c. early-6th century

Mihirakula did issue copper coins on the Gupta model, but I do not have such a coin to show. In addition, he issued these Kushan style coins, based on prototypes such as the coins of Gadahara. These coins were probably issued in Kashmir once Mihirakula was in power there.

Vaishravana ? silver drachm, c. mid-6th century
Crowned bust of king right, wearing diadem with crescent ornaments trident at right, three-headed snake at left, Brahmi legend above: shahi vaishravanashya ?
Reverse obliterated, but presumably fire altar with armed attendants Weight: 3.82 gm, Diameter: 25 mm., Die axis: ? o'clock Ref: Göbl --
An amazing coin with a legend, which I (thanks to help from Shailen Bhandare) am tentatively reading shahi vaishravanashya. I believe this coin belongs in the group with Toramana and Mihirakula for one simple reason: it has a legend that passes in a continuous arc above the king's head, a feature of the drachms of Toramana and Mihirakula not seen on any coins of Khingila, Javukha or Mehama, or coins related to those. Further, this coin has two prominent symbols ... continuing the trident from Mihirakula's coins and replacing the chakra standard with a surprising symbol that has been seen as a yak-tail fan or whisk (unlikely) or a three-headed snake, which is what it looks like to me. This may be a representation of the multi-headed snake god Shesha. Göbl shows a few other coins types (types 108-110) that also have similar features and probably belong to this series; he reads the king's name on these coins as Baysara. The name "Baysara" does seem to



159
have some similarity to the name Vaishravana, so the two coin types may therefore be related.
The Coin Galleries: Javukha
Javukha was the third king mentioned in the Schøyen copper scroll inscription. Having this explicit mention of his name solved a long- standing debate; many authors had maintained that the coins with the name Javukha must have been issues of Toramana; they read the name on the coins as Jabula and related it to the title jaUvla applied to Toramana in the Kura inscription. But now we are clear that there was indeed a king named Javukha and these coins are his.
The continuing debate with regard to this king is whether the coins with the name Zabokho (see below) are his or of another king. I would maintain that it is almost certain that these coins are all of the same king. The coins with the javukha legend are all in Brahmi, while the coins with zabokho are all in Bactrian script. Thus the "different" names may well just be alternative renditions in scripts that can only imperfectly represent foreign sounds. For example, Brahmi has no letter for the za sound, so ja would be a logical way to represent it. Similarly, Bactrian does not have a letter for va and so ba would be an alternative. So there's a perfectly good explanation for the apparently different names.
Besides the "different" names, the other reason some people think these are two different kings is that the Zabokho portrait coins are all smaller and of a different style than the Javukha coins. But this could simply refelct the fact that they were made at different mints: the Zabokho coins perhaps in a mint in Bactria and the Javukha coins in Gandhara. Further, these are the only two series that feature horse-rider types, suggesting a close relationship between them. Finally, I publish below a Javukha coin in the small format "Zabokho" style, thereby closing that supposed "gap" between them. Thus it seems to me to be much more likely that these are coins of the same king than that they are different kings.
Javukha
Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends lunar crescents on shoulders, "bull" tamgha at left, ribboned club at right, Brahmi legend at left: shahi, at right: javukha / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.16 gm, Diameter: 30 mm., Die axis: 3:30 o'clock Ref: Göbl 49
I have not been able to find a clear antecedent for this coin among the anonymous early Alchon coins. Given the style, the Brahmi legend and the lunar shoulder



160
crescents, it appears this coin type owes its inspiration to the coins of Khingila. I therefore suspect that Javukha came to power well after Khingila, but while Khingila still ruled, perhaps in a geographically different area. Note the unusual way in which the word shahi has been engraved ... in a vertical format, with the letters apparently transposed, and the diacritic mark missing, rendering the word as hasha.
Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends lunar crescents on shoulders, "bull" tamgha at left, ribboned club at right, Brahmi legend at left: shahi, at right: jaookha / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.16 gm, Diameter: 29.5 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 51
The spelling of the king's name on this coin, jaookha underlines the idea that the name was a foreign one with sounds unfamiliar to the Indian diecutters, who struggled to find the ideal way in which to represent the name.
Javukha ? (or follower) silver drachm, c. late-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent forehead ornament and hanging ribbon ends lunar crescents on shoulders, "bull" tamgha at left, conch at right, Brahmi legend at left: jayatu, at right: yapa ? / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants Weight: 3.44 gm, Diameter: 29 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 52
The attribution of this coin is tentative. The style, including the lunar shoulder crescents, seems to link the coin to the previous two of Javukha. The conch is a symbol used on the "Zabocho" coins. So an assignment to Javukha or possibly a follower of Javukha, seems reasonable. The legend, however, is unclear. It seems to read jayatu at left and yapa (meant to be shahi perhaps ?) at right. A legend of jayatu shahi would be consistent with an attribution to Javukha. We await a better specimen to get a clearer attribution.

Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
King mounted on horse right, wearing crescent crown with trailng ribbon ends "bull" tamgha at left, club at right, Brahmi legend at left: shahi ja, at right: vu(kha) / Fire altar, unattended Weight: 3.16 gm, Diameter: 20.5 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl 117
Javukha issued these very interesting and dramatically different horse-rider type coins, probably inspired by the horse-rider dinars of the Guptas. Note the presence of the two symbols seen on his earlier portrait drachms: club and "bull"/lunar tamgha.
Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
King mounted on horse right, wearing crescent crown with trailng ribbon ends "bull" tamgha at left, club at right, Brahmi legend at left: shahi javu, at right: kha / Fire altar, unattended (not visible) Weight: 3.30 gm, Diameter: 21.5 mm., Die axis: ? o'clock Ref: Göbl 117
This coin is similar to the last one but has a different legend arrangement, with the letter vu in the king's name moving over to left of the king's head.
Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent crown and hanging ribbon ends stylized thunderbolt at right, Brahmi legend at left: shahi javu(kha) / Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants ? Weight: 3.04 gm, Diameter: 23 mm., Die axis: 3 o'clock Ref: Göbl --- (unpublished)
This coin, previously unpublished, bridges the "gap" between the coins of Javukha and the so-called "Zabokho" coins that follow. The crown style and the letter forms resemble those on the previous horserider type coins; at the same time, the crown and size format of the coin resembles those of the Zabokho coins. There is also a Zabokho type that features the thunderbolt as on this coin. The coin therefore



162
appreciably strengthens the case for believing that the Javukha and Zabokho coins were issued by the same king.
"Zabokho"
Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent crown and hanging ribbon ends chakra or wheel on top of lotus flower at right, indistinct object at left, Bactrian legend at left: (miirosono shao), at right: zabokho /
Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants ? Weight: 3.04 gm, Diameter: 23 mm., Die axis: 3:30 o'clock Ref: Göbl 96
This coin is typical of the so-called "Zabokho" coins. It has a small flan and a crown topped by a large crescent (with a trident inside the crescent). These details are different from the first few Javukha coins listed above, but are matched by the last Javukha coin.
Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent crown and hanging ribbon ends thunderbolt at right, indistinct object at left, Bactrian legend at left: (miirosono shao), at right: zabokho /
Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants ? Weight: 3.46 gm, Diameter: 23.5 mm., Die axis: 3:30 o'clock Ref: Göbl 96A
This coin, with its thunderbolt symbol, closely matches the last Javukha coin.

Weight: 3.46 gm, Diameter: 22.5 mm., Die axis: ? o'clock Ref: Göbl 101
Another Zabokho type, this time with a trident topping a vase instead of the thunderbolt symbol.
Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
Crowned bust of king right, with crescent crown and hanging ribbon ends lotus blossom at right, indistinct object at left, Fire altar, flanked by armed attendants ? Weight: 3.46 gm, Diameter: 22 mm., Die axis: ? o'clock Ref: Göbl 104
Although his name is not visible on this coin, this appears to ba another Zabokho type, this time with a beautiful lotus blossom at right.
Javukha silver drachm, c. late-5th century
King mounted on horse right, wearing crescent crown with trailng ribbon ends conch at right, Bactrian legend at left: zabokho / Solar disc standard, flanked by two animals Weight: 3.20 gm, Diameter: 22 mm., Die axis: 12:30 o'clock Ref: Göbl 106
There are also horse-rider type coins with the zabokho legend, providing further evidence of the close connection between the Javukha and Zabokho coins. These are the only silver horse-rider coins in the entire Alchon coinage.
Ancient Indian coin of Hun, Sri Vishvarazukare in Indus Script & Brāhmī. Possible links with हूण king Khingila and Mahā Vināyaka in Gardez
https://tinyurl.com/ydawf9d7 A remarkable feature to note on thousands of ancient Indian coins is the continued use of Indus Script Hypertexts even after the invention of Kharoṣṭhī and Brāhmī scripts.
While the Brāhmī and Kharoṣṭhī syllabic scripts were used to write down the namesof theissuing rulers, the Indus Script Hypertexts continue to be used to proclaim the metallurgical competence and metallurgical repertoire of ancient Indian mints.
This simply means that the Indus Script Cipher which was used to proclaim metalwork catalogues continued from Sarasvati Civilization days of 4th millennium BCE into the historical periods and in the Common Era.

हूण
Hunnic Kingdom, khār खार् 'blacksmiths' ?, silver drachm, c. 5th century CE Diademed bust of king right, wearing fabtastic winged crown, Tamgha at left, Brāhmī legend at right: Sri Vishvarazukare ? / Fire altar flanked by attendants Weight: 2.91 gm., Diam: 29 mm. Ref: MAC --
"The Golden Age of the Guptas lasted some 150 years. In the fifth century, Hunnic tribes from the northwest started to pose a serious military challenge to the empire. Kumaragupta and later his son Skandagupta were able to initially repulse these invaders, but eventually the Huns were able to establish a major presence in the northwest of India... It shows a king's bust right in the Sasanian style, wearing a fantastic winged crown that features a sun and moon at the front, a bull's head behind that and a panther head on top, apart from the eagle wings on the sides. We do not know who this king is and the legend on the coin has never been read. This coin is the first one to have a fully legible legend. The letter forms are very complex, but I believe the legend reads Sri Vishvarazukare. The reverse of the coin features a traditional Sasanian style Zoroastrian fire altar, flanked by two attendants."

Two iconographic representations of Gaṇeśa which predate any pratimā found in Bhārat are reported from China (dated to ca. 500 CE).
1. In Sri Lanka, the oldest image of Ganesh is found in the Kantak Chaitya in Mihintale dated to 1st century BCE.
2. Mahāvināyaka of Gardez, Afghanistan is dated to 5th century CE.
3. A painting of the elephant-headed deity is found in Cave 285 at Tun-huang, a chamber excavated in the Northern Wei dynasty but with some decorations dating the image to the T’ang dynasty.
4. A stone sculpture of the deity is found at Kung-hsien. The inscription on the image.datesit to 531 CE. Gaṇeśa of Kung-hsien is a two-armed seated figure, holds a lotus, the inscription described Gaṇeśa as the ‘‘Spirit King of Elephants’’.

“The theme of aiding the demonic spirits in order to control them and to stop the hindrances they create is continued in the works of a mid-eighth century Chinese disciple of Amoghavajra. Han-kuang pointed out that Vināyaka had many forms, the embracing figures, Ganapati, and the elephant-headed king. The Chinese Tantric master taught that the elephant-headed king is a symbol of the great power Vināyaka possesses, but just as an elephant can be tamed by the keeper, so Vināyaka can be tamed by certain rituals.” (Lewis Lancaster, 1991, Gaṇeśa in CHina: Methods of transforming the demonic, in: Robert L.

Gaṇeśa is invoked in the R̥ gveda (RV 2.23.1) as leader of gaņa, the retinue of Śiva. (Wilson, H. H. Ŗgveda Saṃhitā. Sanskrit text, English translation, notes, and index of verses.

Griffith translation: RV 2.23
Brahmanaspati. 23 1. WE call thee, Lord and Leader of the heavenly hosts, the wise among the wise, the famousest of all, The King supreme of prayers, O Brahmanaspati: hear us with help; sit down in place of sacrifice. 2 Brhaspati, God immortal! verily the Gods have gained from thee, the wise, a share in holy rites. As with great light the Sun brings forth the rays of morn, so thou alone art Father of all sacred prayer. 3 When thou hast chased away revilers and the gloom, thou mountest the refulgent car of sacrifice; The awful car, Brhaspati, that quells the foe, slays demons, cleaves the stall of kine, and finds the light. 4 Thou leadest with good guidance and preservest men; distress overtakes not him who offers gifts to thee. Him who hates prayer thou punishest, Brhaspati, quelling his wrath: herein is thy great mightiness. 5 No sorrow, no distress from any side, no foes, no creatures doubletongued- have overcome the man, Thou drivest all seductive fiends away from him whom, careful guard, thou keepest Brahmanaspati. 6 Thou art our keeper, wise, preparer of our paths: we, for thy service, sing to thee with hymns of praise. Brhaspati, whoever lays a snare for us, him may his evil fate, precipitate, destroy. 7 Him, too, who threatens us without offence of ours, the evilminded, arrogant, rapacious man, Him turn thou from our path away, Brhaspati: give us fair access to this banquet of the Gods. 8 Thee as protector of our bodies we invoke, thee, saviour, as the comforter who loveth us. Strike, O Brhaspati, the Gods revilers down, and let not the unrighteous come to highest bliss. 9 Through thee, kind prosperer, O Brahmanaspati, may we obtain the wealth of Men which all desire: And all our enemies, who near or far away prevail against us, crush, and leave them destitute. 10 With thee as our own rich and liberal ally may we, Brhaspati, gain highest power of life. Let not the guileful wicked man be lord of us: still may we prosper, singing goodly hymns of praise. 11 Strong, never yielding, hastening to the battlecry-, consumer of the foe, victorious in the strife, Thou art sins' true avenger, Brahmanaspati, who tamest even the fierce, the wildly

passionate. 12 Whoso with mind ungodly seeks to do us harm, who, deeming him a man of might mid lords, would slay, Let not his deadly blow reach us, Brhaspati; may we humiliate the strong illdoers-' wrath. 13 The mover mid the spoil, the winner of all wealth, to be invoked in fight and reverently adored, Brhaspati hath overthrown like cars of war all wicked enemies who fain would injure us. 14 Burn up the demons with thy fiercest flaming brand, those who have scorned thee in thy manifested might. Show forth that power that shall deserve the hymn of praise: destroy the evil speakers, O Brhaspati. 15 Brhaspati, that which the foe deserves not which shines among the folk effectual, splendid, That, Son of Law I which is with might refulgentthat- treasure wonderful bestow thou on us. 16 Give us not up to those who, foes in ambuscade, are greedy for the wealth of him who sits at ease, Who cherish in their heart abandonment of Gods. Brhaspati, no further rest shall they obtain. 17 For Tvastar, he who knows each sacred song, brought thee to life, preeminent over all the things that be. Guiltscourger-, guiltavenger- is Brhaspati, who slays the spoiler and upholds the mighty Law. 18 The mountain, for thy glory, cleft itself apart when, Angiras! thou openedst the stall of kine. Thou, O Brhaspati, with Indra for ally didst hurl down waterfloods- which gloom had compassed round. 19 O Brahmanaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn and prosper thou our children. All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.

Forge scene stele. Forging of a keris or kris (the iconic Javanese dagger) and other weapons. The blade of the keris represents the khaNDa. Fire is a purifier, so the blade being forged is also symbolic of the purification process central theme of the consecration of gangga sudhi specified in the inscription on the 1.82 m. tall, 5 ft. dia. lingga hieroglyph, the deity of Candi Sukuh.
