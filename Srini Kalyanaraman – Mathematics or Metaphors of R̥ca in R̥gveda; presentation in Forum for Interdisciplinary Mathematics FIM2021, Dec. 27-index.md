Abstract submitted by Dr. S. Kalyanaraman, Sarasvati Research Centre
The aim is to provide a mathematical model to understand ‘meaning’ of a R̥ ca in R̥ gveda. Many attempts have been made to understand the form and function of what is referred to as Chandas ‘metrical’ renderings of R̥ ca. Among the commentators, Sāyaṇa provides leads detailing the context in which a particular word or expression is used in a R̥ ca. The method can be explained by citing a particular R̥ ca: ऋेग्वदः - मण्डल २
सूंक्त २.४१. ऋच् ̥rc ‘prayer’ १६ अम्बितमे नदीतमे देवितमे सरस्ववत ।
अप्रशस्ता इि स्मवस प्रश म्बस्तमि ृनस्कवि ॥१६॥ The meaning is rendered as: Best Mother, best of Rivers, best of Goddesses, Sarasvati, We are, as it were, of no repute and dear Mother, give thou us renown. (Griffith’s translation into English). The reference is to a river; but the explanations use metaphors, like mathematical models, to signify two expanded meanings: 1. Mother; 2. Devi or Shining One. Thus, गृत्समद the R̥ ṣi of this R̥ ca 2.41.16 is using a mathematical formula: River named Sarasvati = Mother, Shining One. The prayer is intended to signify a river which gains the attributes of a Mother and a Shining One. Prof. Damodaran, Vēdayana Bhāradvāja, in his Treatise on R̥ gveda (2017) presents the entire Rgveda in four categories of knowledge: 1. Gross world – Natural phenomena observed by the sensory organs (Adhibhautika) 2. Subtle world – Interpretations of observed phenomena, attributing it to imaginary divinities (Adhidaivika) 3. Causal world – Conveiving Soma and conferring on him the sole Causership of Nature (Adhyatmik or Self-knowledge) 4. Birth-less state – the permanent state on which this changing Nature is being superimposed

This can be called turīya n. the 4th state of spirit (pure impersonal Spirit or Brahma), Up. (MaitrUp. ; NṛsUp. ii, 2, 1, Vedântas.) (Monier-Williams) तुरीय turīya (In Vedānta. phil.) The
fourth state of the आत्मन् ātman in which it becomes one with Brahman or the Supreme
आत्मन् ātman. (Apte) Results and concluding remarks: The form and function of words and expressions of an ancient language of chandas or R̥ gveda finds phonetic variants in spoken forms which are recorded in various language lexicons. Using the meanings recorded in over 25 ancient language lexicons of Ancient India, it is possible to derive the intended ‘meanings and metaphors’ of words and expressions of R̥ gveda.
