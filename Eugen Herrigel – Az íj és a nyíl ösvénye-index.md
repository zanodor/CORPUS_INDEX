The Knightly Art of Archery
Translated by Lutgard Cunningham and edited by Charles Harper

PREFACE
Eugen Herrigel returned to Germany in 1929, and in 1936 he
published a 20-page article entitled 'Die Ritterliche Kunst des
Bogenschiessens' in the journal, Zeitshrift für Japanologie . This was,
essentially, the text of a speech he had given earlier that year, on 25
February 1936, to the Berlin chapter of the German-Japanese
Society. This text was immediately translated into Japanese by a Mr.
Shibata so that it could be shown to Herrigel's Master Awa, and it
was published by Imperial Tohoku University in that same year.
Herrigel's influence on Japanese archers began from that volume,



which is still in print in Japan, along with translations of his later
books.
'Die Ritterliche Kunst des Bogenschiessens' ('The Knightly Art of
Archery') was the core and basis for his well-known Zen in the Art of
Archery (1951). The journal article was presented in three sections,
and the first two sections were expanded and amplified in order to
create the later book; the third section attempted to elucidate
Herrigel's thoughts on the wider field of mysticism and spirituality,
and perhaps because he had less success in clearly presenting
these ideas-- or, to give him the benefit of the doubt, because of his
artistic sense of unity--, he elected to minimize this discussion in the
book. Whole paragraphs were carried over from sections I and II of
the article to the book; little was carried over from section III. Also, in
the earlier article Herrigel felt free to express some candid personal
opinions which he perhaps did not consider judicious in the later
book.
The journal article has recently been translated by Lutgard
Cunningham and edited by Charles Harper, and is herewith being
published on the internet. Should you copy or quote from this
translation, we would appreciate your crediting us.
I.
'The knightly art of archery': Is 'archery' not obviously a kind of sport,
and 'art' therefore athletic technique? Do you not expect to hear of
the prowess of skilled Japanese marksmen, heirs of a time
honoured and almost unbroken tradition in the use of bow and
arrow? Indeed, modern weaponry superseded traditional military
arms only a few generations ago in the Far East, but familiarity with
their use did not fade; on the contrary, it has spread ever more
widely since then. Do you then perhaps expect an account of the



way archery is today, as almost a national sport in Japan?
Nothing could be further from the truth! The Japanese do not
consider archery a sport, but, as odd as it may sound, a wholly
spiritual process. [ 'geistig' can be variously translated as 'spiritual',
'mental', or 'intellectual'. Herrigel certainly considers it as something
more than a mere psychological attribute; In Zen in the Art of
Archery, R.F.C. Hull translates this as 'religious'-- ed. ] The 'art' of
archery is not primarily physical, a technical skill whose measure is
the hitting of the target, but rather an ability whose development is
to be attained through purely spiritual exercises, and whose aim is a
spiritual encounter: fundamentally, the archer takes aim at himself
and perhaps successfully hits himself.
This undoubtedly sounds like a riddle. What? Is he telling us that
archery, once pursued as a matter of life and death, is no longer even
an active sport, but has become a spiritual exercise? What are bow
and arrow and target for? Has the brave old art of archery, with its
clear and straightforward purpose, been replaced entirely by
something vague and ambiguous, if not openly incredible?
We must first realize that the peculiar spirit of this art has simply
become more apparent now that it no longer needs to prove itself in
mortal combat. This spirit was not incorporated into bow-shooting
merely as an afterthought, but has been bound up with it since
ancient times. Only recently has it become possible to cultivate this
spirit in utter purity, and to allow it to emerge from obfuscation by
any secondary objective. The art of archery remains a matter of life
and death, without in the least losing its urgency, for conflict still
remains, though now of course it is the battle of the archer with
himself. And it is precisely here that the real spirit of this art reveals
itself. This inner conflict is the essential, powerful foundation of all
outwardly directed conflict with an opponent. Since the latter is



absent, the essence of archery has been reduced to its quintessence
and made manifest.
If we inquire now after this innermost foundation of archery, of this
conflict of the archer with himself, the answer must sound
completely enigmatic. The struggle of the archer with himself is such
that he aims at himself-- and yet not at himself; that he occasionally
hits upon himself-- and then again does not hit upon himself; and
consequently the essential foundation of archery is without
foundation, bottomless, an abyss. To use an expression familiar to
the Japanese masters: in archery, all depends on attaining an
'immovable center'. Then the art becomes artless, the shot becomes
a non-shooting with bow and arrow, and non-shooting becomes
shooting with neither bow nor arrow. For the Japanese, these
paradoxes ring quite true and are self-evidently the crux of the
matter. We, on the contrary, are baffled by them.
I would like to try to approach this from another perspective. It is no
longer a secret to us Europeans that all of the Japanese arts reflect
in their inner form a common root, Buddhism. This holds true for
archery as it does for ink drawing, the tea ceremony, the art of the
actor, flower arrangement, swordsmanship-- only to name a few-
and it implies first that all these art forms presuppose a certain
spiritual attitude in their practitioners and cultivate this attitude more
or less consciously, an attitude in its purest form characteristically
Buddhist. Of course, it is not Buddhist in the larger sense. We are not
concerned here with the speculative or reflective Buddhism which,
through the available literature, is the only Buddhism known (and
supposedly understood) in Europe, but with that Buddhism called
Zen in Japan, which is not primarily speculation, but practice,
meditative practice, where little value is placed on intellectually
acquired knowledge thereof in order to inform the life therein with
undiluted power.



Thus, archery is grounded in spiritual exercises, that is, precisely
understood 'mystical' exercises, and consequently attaches
significance not to the external bow and arrow, but to internal
change within oneself. Bow and arrow are only a pretext for
something that could also take place without them; they are only the
means to an end, not the end itself. The goal to which this leads may
be called 'unio mystica', union with the deity, effectively attaining
Buddhahood. If we turn to elucidations by Japanese researchers to
gain a deeper understanding, material is available. D.T. Suzuki for
example has shown, in his Essays in Zen Buddhism [Suzuki, Daisetz
T., Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series 1927], that Japanese culture
and Zen are very closely knit; that the Japanese art forms, the
spiritual attitude of the samurai, the Japanese lifestyle, the moral,
practical, aesthetic, and to some extent the intellectual life of the
Japanese cannot be understood without this Zen basis.
The writings of Suzuki and other Japanese scholars have found
response in the American and European literature on Japan, but
while our knowledge has considerably broadened, our wisdom has
unfortunately not grown.
The Japanese lives-- whether he acknowledges this or not-- in the
atmosphere and spirit of Zen, and so all is connected, inside and out,
first and last, clear and distinct to him. Brief hints are sufficient for an
apprentice to understand, mere indications are enough when he
wants to express himself, because he has grown up at the heart of
Zen and he has easy recourse to experienced teachers.
However, when he tries to make himself understood to Europeans,
using familiar language, he forgets that they have another spiritual
origin. He expects them not to absorb his words alone; but he knows
too little about their way of thinking, he is far too little initiated into
their viewpoint. For the Japanese, words are only the way to an idea



which must be understood by reading between the lines; it is not
expressed in a way that can be understood by all, but is only to be
derived from experience. Therefore, his comments, taken literally,
seem rudimentary or confusing to the European, who is used to
logical intellection. Conversely, he must think us to be without
intuition, if not without spirit, when we express ourselves, in spite of
the sharp intellect he generously attributes to us.
In this attitude he is largely justified by American and European
research to date on the topic of Buddhism, particularly Zen. Western
researchers have had no choice but to keep to the texts, translating
and commenting upon them, and editing them by standard
philological methods. This done, they think they have understood
these arcane texts, but all possibility for real communication is
crushed by this word-fetish. They are immeasurably far from
comprehending the untold depths of mystical being. They do not
realize that in true mysticism, experience comes first, conscious
retention of experience comes second, and interpretation and
classification come last. There is no way to fully understand
mysticism, except by becoming a mystic.
Consequently, there is no longer any point in simply startling you
with paradoxical formulas or placating you with a mouthful of words.
I want more: I want not just to incite, but also to excite you. [ The
original German contrast is between 'anregen' and'aufregen', more
wordplay than substance-- ed. ] I want you to become aware that
understanding the words of Buddhist writings, especially Zen
Buddhist literature and writings on the Japanese arts, whose roots
lie in Zen, does not bring you a step closer to the quintessence of
Buddhism. I will present, not the essence of archery, but simply a
brief graphic account of my almost six years of instruction in this art
under one of the best teachers in Japan. I have taken care
particularly to record in detail my inner opposition, especially my



hypercritical attitude, which I had to overcome before I succeeded in
entering significantly into the spirit of this high art form. Possibly in
this way I can reach your understanding. I admit that I cannot
transmit with words the inner experiences on which all else depends;
my narrative may require a 'willing suspension of disbelief'. But that is
better than abandoning any attempt to understand the reality of this
mystical art only because it seems such a steep and inaccessible
road.
II.
Why I decided to study the art of archery requires some explanation.
Even as a student I was interested in mysticism, especially German
mysticism, and I sensed that I was missing something to fully
understand it, a quiddity that I could not identify and about which I
could find no information. I felt that I stood in front of a final gate, but
lacked the key to it.
When I was offered work for a few years at Imperial Tohoku
University [ in Sendai City, 300 km. north of Tokyo; R.F.C. Hull
incorrectly credits Herrigel with teaching at the University of Tokyo-
ed. ], I welcomed the opportunity of getting to know Japan and its
fascinating people and above all of connecting with living Buddhism
and discovering the key to 'detachment' [ 'Abgeschiedenheit', usually
translated as 'seclusion, solitude', here is closer to the more modern
term, 'detachment' from the world of illusion. Hull translates this as
'introspective practice of mysticism'-- ed. ]. Meister Eckhart highly
values this detachment but he does not describe the way of attaining
it. Soon after my arrival in Japan, I tried to realize my intention, but I
was informed that direct access to the practice of mysticism was too
difficult, in fact hopeless, for a European. It was recommended that I
begin studying one of the Japanese arts, which all share in the spirit



of Buddhism, yet are much more straightforward, allowing easier and
more tangible access to understanding. My wife decided to study
the arts of flower arrangement and ink drawing, while I felt more
attracted to the art of archery where, as later became obvious, I
wrongly assumed that my years of firearm practice would be helpful.
One of my Japanese colleagues had been studying archery for many
years under the great Master [Kenzo] Awa, and I asked him to
introduce me as a potential student, but the Master refused the
request on the grounds that he had once let himself be tempted into
teaching a foreigner, and it had been a bad experience. He was
furthermore unwilling to make any concessions to his students,
unlike teachers in Tokyo and other large cities, who were concerned
with losing their foreign students if they overly importuned them with
the real spirit of their art. Only when I vowed that a master with such
a strict view of his art could treat me as his youngest pupil, because I
wanted to learn not just the superficial handling of bow and arrow
but the 'great teachings' of archery-- only then was I accepted as a
student, together with my wife, because women in Japan also
commonly study this art. And so began my rigorous instruction, in
which my Japanese colleague participated as translator.
That the road toward artless art is not easy, we discovered in the first
hour of study. Master Awa, asking us to watch him carefully, drew his
bow and shot. It looked very beautiful and at the same time very
effortless. Then he thrust a practice bow into my hands, remarking,
--Archery is not a sport and thus it does not exist to develop your
physique. You cannot draw the bow using the strength of your arms,
but you must learn to draw it spiritually, that is, with muscles
completely loose and relaxed.
At the first try, I noticed immediately that I needed considerable



muscular strength to draw the bow. What is more, this bow was not
held like an English sport bow at shoulder height, so that one can
press oneself into it during the draw. The Japanese bow is raised so
high that the hands are above the level of the archer's head; all
pushing or pressing stops and the hands are instead pulled apart
until the left or bow hand is at eye level, the left arm is straightened
completely, and the hand of the bent right arm is above the right
shoulder joint-- in this way a considerable span is obtained. The
archer then must remain some time in this position before he can let
the arrow go. Not only did my arms start to shake from the strain
after a few seconds, but also my breathing became more laboured,
so that I had to recover it when the arrow had been released.
Repeatedly, day after day, drawing the bow remained a difficult strain
and did not want to become 'spiritual' despite all my efforts. I
consoled myself with the thought that the Master must be speaking
cryptically, so that the student would not too soon discover there
was some trick to drawing the bow which he would eventually learn.
I practiced incessantly, with German thoroughness, pondering the
problem, testing what I had thought out then rejecting it as
ineffective, but always expecting to surprise the Master one day with
the solution to his conundrum. During the practice hours he watched
me motionlessly with his deep, mild and piercing eyes, praised my
enthusiasm, criticized by expenditure of energy during the draw and
the release, but otherwise let me alone to advance in my own way-
until I had to admit one day that I was stuck. In this manner I became
more open to further instruction.
The Master explained that I could not draw the bow correctly
because I was inhaling with my lungs.
--Press your breath slowly downward at the drawing point so that
the abdominal wall is tightly stretched; retain the breath there,



without desperately pushing; inhale and exhale only as much as you
really need. When you can breathe in this way, you will be able to
draw the bow effortlessly with relaxed, unburdened arms, because
you will have shifted your energy center downward.
To prove this, he drew his powerful bow and asked me to feel his
arms: they were indeed as relaxed as if they were not performing any
work at all.
In time I could do such unusual breathing better and better, and I had
to admit that the drawing of the bow was becoming easier.
Occasionally the Master would step behind me and feel my arm
muscles; and only after they had become completely slackened was
I allowed to release the arrow.
To arrive at the correct drawing of a bow after a year of practice is
certainly no impressive achievement. But I was satisfied because,
using the correct breathing method, I had also learned something
else that I had not grasped until then: the patience not to run ahead
of inner development, to leave things to their natural inertia, as it
were. I also knew that I could now be given a new task, although I
had convinced myself long before of its particular difficulty.
I had until now accomplished the shot by simply releasing the arrow.
One should think about the following, though: the right hand is
covered with a leather glove. The thumb is well-padded and is
wrapped around the bowstring under the arrow and under the
fingers. Index, middle and ring fingers rest over the thumb firmly
[Depending on the type of shooting glove, 2, 3 or all 4 fingers of the
right hand may rest over the thumb-- ed.] and also lend a steady
support to the arrow. To release the shot, the fingers covering the
thumb must open and free it. The power of the bowstring pulls the
thumb out of its position and straightens it-- the string whizzes, the



freed arrow hurries away. However, as often as I released the shot, I
always gave a noticeable jerk. I could not but tear open thumb and
fingers when I had to release my hand from the drawn bow.
That had to stop. There was no jerking when the Master released a
shot; his hand opened suddenly without revealing how it occurred; it
happened in a flash. I tried to imitate this, without success. And now
no longer so keen to solve riddles by myself, I admitted to him that I
could not advance further for the life of me.
--That, he said, is your main mistake, that you have such a good
'will'. You want to let the arrow go when you feel or think that it is
time to do so; you deliberately open your right hand; in short, you are
conscious of it. You must learn to be without purpose, to wait until
the shot is released by itself.
--But when I wait for that, I retorted, the shot is not released at all; I
keep the bow drawn as long as I can; and if I did not at last let the
arrow consciously go, then the drawn bow would pull my hands
together so that there would be no shot at all.
--When I told you to wait, answered the Master, it was perhaps
expressed misleadingly. In all truth, you should neither wait nor think
nor feel nor want: the artless art means that you become completely
ego- less, that you lose yourself. And when it comes quite naturally
to you, that is, when it comes to Nothing completely, then you will be
able to make the shot.
I did not content myself with this, now that Master Awa had finally
touched upon the topic which had been the precise reason I had
chosen this art as a discipline.
--When I have come to a mere Nothing, I asked, who is doing the
shooting then?



--Once you have experienced who is shooting for you, replied the
Master, you will need a teacher no longer. How should I explain in
words to you, that which you will understand only after you have
experienced it? Should I say the Buddha shoots? In this case, what
use is all knowledge to you? Rather learn to concentrate yourself, to
turn yourself from the outside inward and even to gradually lose
sight of that!
The Master indicated how this deep concentration could be reached:
to keep oneself as quiet as possible and to compose oneself an hour
before shooting, to settle oneself using proper breathing, to
gradually turn off all impressions, then to draw the bow calmly and
let everything else just happen. This way, one eventually reaches a
condition approaching complete No-self-ness, and from there one
may be able to pass over to the No-self. One is drawn back out of
this state when the shot has been released, the tension has been
dissipated, the endless energy has done its work.
We practiced for a long time with this in mind, at first to no effect.
Every now and then, though, I had the impression that I had really
reached the No-self when drawing the bow. But the longer I stood
there with the drawn bow, the more I felt its strong tension, and I
could not avoid thinking that it was now time that 'It' should shoot.
And in the end I was still forced to open my hand consciously.
Instead of letting the shot surprise me, I watched over it and I was
aware of the moment the shot was fired. Days and months went by
without having a single arrow released in the way it should be done.
The Master did not lose patience; he reminded me that many of his
students fared no better, even after many years of instruction. He
told me:
--You try hard at being purposeless and so you are intentionally
purposeless; this will not help you further.



But when I replied that I should at least decide to be purposeless
because I did not know how else I could instill purposelessness, the
Master was at a loss and could not answer me. I later found out
indirectly that he had bought some Japanese textbooks on
philosophy, hoping that he would find in them a way to satisfy his
indefatigable inquisitor. But after reading awhile, he would shake his
head and put them aside, thinking that he could now understand
why nothing 'spiritually' correct could be expected of me, who
occupied myself professionally with such things!
By now we were in our third year. The prospect of overcoming this
hurdle had faded even more. In order to overcome my
embarrassment, I told myself that the release of the shot was in truth
only possible 'technically'; there should be a way of shooting
whereby the shot 'purposelessly' happened. When the summer
holiday started, I occupied myself completely with this problem. I
concluded that the quality of the shot should depend on the way I
release the fingers covering the bent thumb; and soon I discovered a
clear and practical way: I told myself that if I subtly loosened and
straightened the fingers, the moment should come when the thumb
lost its wedged position and was therefore unexpectedly pulled out,
releasing the string and arrow through no cause of my own. I
practiced with this in mind and I was soon pleased to see that it was
becoming an easier and more 'purposeless' release than before. I
gradually acquired great technical accuracy in this way of shooting,
so I was looking forward with confidence to resuming my lessons. Of
course, in doing it this way, I had for the most part abandoned the
prescribed exercises for concentration, which had been the reason I
had wanted to learn archery in the first place. So it seemed that my
fervent wish to become familiar with the mystic practice of
detachment would remain unfulfilled. Did it make any sense to
continue archery, which now was more a sport, a technical exercise?



Should I not choose a different road for the sake of my original
purpose?
The decision came faster and was certainly otherwise than I had
expected. In my first lesson after the vacation, I released my new
shot in front of the Master. In my judgement it was a great success. I
was waiting for praise, but Master Awa said in the driest possible
voice:
--Please, once more. The second shot seemed even better than the
first to me. I proudly looked at the Master. Without saying a word, he
came up to me, took the bow softly out of my hands, and stood it in
a corner. wordlessly, he seated himself on his cushion and gazed
straight ahead as if he were alone. I knew what this meant, and I left
the dojo. The next day I was told that I had hurt him deeply with my
wish to deceive him.
It was only after a long entreaty in which I was able to explain to him
that there seemed to be no other way for me but the technical for
something which remained 'spiritually' unattainable, he understood
my misery and accepted my apology.
The most important exercises were thoroughly and constantly
repeated until there was no more doubt that I was blindly following
his instruction. Perhaps one more year had gone by when I
succeeded in the first shot which received his full approval. The spell
was evidently broken. The good shots gradually dominated over the
bad ones. But when I am asked how I finally managed to release a
correct shot, I must answer that I do not know. The arrow went on its
way without any help from me and without my being able to
understand how it happened.
After another year, a day came when Master Awa considered it
advisable to give me my final assignment: to shoot at the target.



Until now a straw bale, at a distance of about two meters, had served
as target, so that we inevitably hit it. Now we were put in front of the
real target, sixty meters away from the archer [The modern standard
target range is 28 meters, while long-range targets are 55 m. or 90
m. The famous competition range at Sanjusangendo in Kyoto is,
however, 60 meters. Hull inexplicably translates this as '60 feet'-
ed.], and the Master asked us just to repeat what we had learned up
until then. Of course, I asked him immediately how I was supposed to
aim the bow in order to hit the target. The Master answered:
--Don't concern yourself with the target. Shoot as before!
--But I must aim if I want to hit, I replied.
--No, shouted the Master, you should not aim. You may not think
about the target, nor about hitting it, nor about anything else! Draw
the bow and wait until the shot releases; let everything else happen,
whichever way it happens.
Having said this, he took his bow, drew, released, and the arrow sat
in the center of the target. Then he inquired:
--Did you observe me well? Did you notice that I closed my eyes
almost completely, like the Buddha of illustrations when he is
completely withdrawn into himself? I close my eyes so that the target
becomes less and less distinct, then it seems to come towards me
and becomes one with me. One can accomplish this only in a state
of deepest concentration. If the target is one with me, then it means
that I am one with the Buddha and the arrow is in the unmoving
center of Being as well as Non-being-- and as a result is also in the
middle of the target. It is in the center, this we can clearly see: it
comes out of the center and goes into the center. Therefore, do not
aim for the target, but for yourself, and then you will hit yourself, the
Buddha and the target all at once.



I tried to follow the Master's guidance, but I only partially succeeded.
I could not lose the target completely from sight and consequently
could not avoid aiming, yet my arrows always flew everywhere
except into the target. It upset me because I was accustomed to
counting my 'hits' from the days when I shot firearms. That had a
lasting effect on me, perhaps unconsciously: no matter how
seriously I practiced, to my disappointment I could not hit the target.
The Master reprimanded me because of my impatience.
--You should not worry about hitting, he admonished, or you will
never learn to shoot spiritually. It is easy, through trial and error, to
find a position of the bow that can bring lots of arrows into the
neighborhood of the target; if you want to be such a technician, you
do not really need me, a teacher of spiritual archery.
Indeed, I did not want to become a technician and so I gave up
looking for a position of the bow which would ensure accuracy. But
neither did I become an archer in the spiritual sense. The
fruitlessness of my most sustained efforts weighed heavily upon me.
Should I give up now, just before the end? I knew that there were
many people who practiced ten or twenty years and still remained
students, but my stay in Japan was limited. I could not feel hopeful
for the long run. And so one day I visited the Master and explained to
him that I could not understand, could not learn, this hitting without
aiming. He tried to reassure me, but I was so convinced of my
incapacity that he did not succeed. Finally, he explained that my
inhibition lay simply in my distrust. I would not let myself believe that
the target could be hit without aiming at it. There was only one last
remedy with which he might help me advance, a remedy he did not
like to use. He asked me to come and see him that evening.
I arrived at nine and was brought in to him. He invited me to sit down,
but did not look at me further. After a while he got up and gave me a



sign to follow. We went into the large practice hall next to his house.
He lit a mosquito candle, long and thin like a knitting needle [A type
of joss stick burnt to create repellent smoke. It smoulders rather than
flames at its tip-- ed.], and thrust it into the sand in front of the
target. Then we went to the shooting position. The Master stood so
that the dojo light glared down on him, but the target remained in
utter darkness, and the glowing tip of the mosquito candle was so
faint that I could discern it only with difficulty. Still without speaking,
the Master took his bow and two arrows. He shot the first arrow and
from the sound of the impact I knew that it had found the target. The
second arrow too hit audibly. The Master now asked me to go and
look at both arrows. The first arrow was sunk into the very center of
the target; the second had struck the end of the first and split it. I
brought both arrows back. The Master looked at them pensively and
said finally:
--You may not think it extraordinary that the first shot hit the center
of the target, because I have practiced in this hall for a good thirty
years and I should therefore know, in spite of total darkness, where
my target is located. You may be right-- but the second shot? That
does not come from 'me' and neither have 'I' hit. And now, think this
over: can one still aim in such darkness? Do you still want to cling to
'no hitting without aiming'? Let us bow to the target as we do to the
Buddha!
I gave up all my doubts, my questions, my brooding. I continued to
practice conscientiously without racking my brains about where it all
would lead. I did not even worry anymore whether I would manage in
my lifetime to become so unintentional that I could hit the target with
certainty. I knew that it was no longer up to me. I hit the target
occasionally without having aimed. The master remained unchanged
in his judgment of my shots: he watched only the archer, never the
target. Many a shot that missed the target he considered



remarkable, because he could at least recognize my 'spiritual' form.
When I began considering my hits as completely unimportant, I
produced more shots that won the Master's full approval. I did not
concern myself any longer with what happened around me during
archery. I did not notice how many eyes were watching me. Even the
Master's criticism or praise made less impression on me. I knew that
I had experienced the feeling of 'It' shooting. This experience I could
not lose, even if my hands should suddenly become unable to bend
a bow.
One day, during our fifth year of instruction, the Master told us that
we should take an examination. We passed this test successfully and
received certificates indicating that we had progressed far enough to
be able to practice without a teacher, that we had become teachers.
We were of course students still, but with the possibility of someday
becoming 'masters' of the artless art of archery.
When we left Japan, the Master presented me with his personal bow
as a farewell gift.[On Herrigel's death, this and his own bow were
returned to Japan, and now hang in the place of honor in the archery
dojo at Engakuji Temple in Kamakura-- ed.]
III.
In passing, I want to mention that we also had the chance to become
acquainted with the purest form of mystical meditation as practiced
by Zen priests. Its goal is a 'hitting' without bow and arrow, exactly
what the art of archery should lead to if properly done. Sinking into
groundlessness, whether one becomes purposeless and ego-less
while using bow and arrow, or whether one meditates, sitting like the
Buddha, hands together, is really one and the same. The first method
of meditation is easier to get at and easier to keep up, while the



second method is more difficult, but also longer lasting. In any case,
the crucial point for both is that the practitioner is calm, aimless,
ego-less and not just deemed to be so; that when he has become
Nothing, he really is annihilated and that he does not feel
insignificant. Not only all thought and will, but also feeling is
eliminated in real meditation. The mystical state, the being in Non
being, is totally unspeakable, unwritable, incomparable. One must
experience it to know that words can only paraphrase it, never
describe it. One must have experienced it to know why Zen literature
is teeming with paradoxes, why the Zen student is so long tortured
with them that he finally gives up trying to get to the bottom of
groundlessness through thinking. Then one understands that the
concept of 'nothingness' plays a very crucial part in all mysticism and
is the germ of utter fulfillment, of absolute mastery, of complete
being.
This also explains why some odd ideas circulate in Europe about
Buddhism and mysticism. They are convinced that meditation and
detachment [p 208] rest upon autosuggestion and must therefore be
psychologically explicable; they research forms of ecstatic behavior
in primitive peoples which they naively consider mystical or related
to mysticism, and they are then satisfied with affirming that all
mysticism is in some respects quite normal. Because they are naive
in a non-mystical sense, it would be fruitless to try to explain to them
that they venture upon questions which are not within their purview,
with unsuitable methods and from a worm's-eye view. We must be
wary of those who occupy themselves with texts and their exegeses,
but who, beyond their purely philological work, cannot resist
authoritatively judging everything found in these writings, offering
thoroughly considered opinions which are supposedly irrefutably
substantiated by their quotations.
Meanwhile, they think oddly enough that Buddhism is no more than



the speculative Buddhism which they find accessible; they dismiss
out of hand non-speculative Zen Buddhism, first of all because it
offers no possibility for analysis by their methods. They look upon its
seeming unintelligibility, which is an effect only of their own
limitations ( das doch nur biographische Bedeutung besitzt ), as
objectively real.
They overlook the fact that the roots of speculative Buddhism are to
be found in the primary mystical experience, which they have not
undergone. And because they have not, neither can they decide how
real this mystical experience is, nor whether in many cases
speculative concerns have been developed independently of this
experience and obscure it. Clearly, the strength of Zen Buddhism is
that it does not reject speculation, but remains aware of the great
danger that speculation harbors. Therefore it emphasizes mystical
experience as crucial and in this respect it clearly does not accept
superficiality in its disciples.
I shall go into this no further here. It is more important to mention
another widely held misconception which can indeed be refuted with
fact. One always hears that mysticism, and in particular Buddhism,
leads to a more passive and unworldly, more escapist or anti-worldly
spiritual attitude. [p 209] We assign certain coincident
manifestations of mysticism to mysticism as such. With aversion, we
turn away from this venerable path of inactivity and praise our
Faustian character. We forget that there was a great mystic in the
history of German thought, Meister Eckhart, who preached
alongside detachment the imperishable value of daily living. And
whoever finds these teachings contradictory should reflect that,
much as he would like to, he cannot reproach the Japanese people,
whose spiritual culture and way of life are so rooted in Zen
Buddhism, with passiveness and a 'lethargic, irresponsible'
escapism. The Japanese are so astonishingly active not because



they are lukewarm Buddhists but because the vital, working
Buddhism of Japan sanctions their activity.
Mysticism and escapism are found together without necessarily
affecting each other, as is very tangibly demonstrated in the art of
archery. Bending the bow is preceded by an introductory ceremony:
punctuated by pauses and careful breaths, a specific series of
movements is performed, bringing the archer gradually to face the
target. When the archer begins to draw his bow, he is already
concentrating, and it is possible for him to attain total absorption. As
the bow is bent, the process of concentration is completed and
deepens the longer the draw is sustained, so that all other things
happen outside consciousness. The archer becomes re-aware only
at the moment of the shot, not gradually but suddenly. With the hit,
his familiar surroundings reappear. After having withdrawn from the
world, he throws himself back into it with a force which goes through
him and continues effective in the flying arrow. In this way 'Nothing'
and 'something' [The original German is 'Nichts und Etwas', the
former translating variously as nothingness, emptiness or void, and
the latter as something or entity-- ed.] are, in spite of all inner
differences, closely connected for the archer, even dependent upon
each other. The road from Something to Nothing always leads back
to Something, not because the archer wishes to go back, but
because he is 'thrown' back. And his immediate discovery of this
experience cannot be interpreted through any speculation or
deliberation, can at most be hinted at--but then by methods that are
undeniably of purely speculative, and therefore doubtful, origin.
There exists basically between the Nothing and the Something or, let
us say for convenience, between divinity and worldly existence, the
same indissoluble connection as between total rapture and clear 'I
consciousness'. The experience of being in Non-being becomes an
experience of the 'I', only because the one who is enraptured in I



lessness is always thrown back into the I-being, the 'Perishing' in the
'Becoming', and he therefore experiences what has value far beyond
the compass of his existence.
These are certainly points of departure for reflection, and are crucial
for any true mystical speculation. They enter into the basic mystical
experience. The way in which this is articulated and accentuated
then in part depends on the intensity of the experience, and in part
on the individuality of the person who undergoes the experience.
The more this individuality has been infringed, the more it is affected
by speculation, whose tool is thought and whose base is I
consciousness.
We should go no deeper here into the problems surrounding the
essence of the mystical experience. Another point is pressing: as
mentioned earlier, Buddhism has to a large degree determined and
shaped Japanese culture and lifestyle; only indirectly, however,
because there have always been relatively few who have known
enlightenment-- and this through their arts. Every Japanese learns at
least one art, be it only the art of brushwriting, the foundation for ink
drawing, and he practices this art throughout his life. Archery is
taught as an elective course at all higher institutions, as is
swordsmanship, so the number of people touched by its spirit is
relatively great. Since all these arts have adopted the spirit of
Buddhism, albeit in various shades and varieties suitable to their
natures, is it surprising that its impact on the individual appears in a
very clear and unequivocal fashion?
We often hear the view that through studying this art with great
patience one acquires presence of mind, perseverence of purpose
through unpremeditated action, self-assurance through an
impersonal attitude. While that is true, it is only a side-effect which
has so slight a connection with the core of Zen Buddhism that it



could just as easily occur elsewhere and under completely different
circumstances. Yet, even the impersonality of attitude, which in
contrast to the occidental worship of the 'self' is so strongly
characteristic of Japanese intellectual life, can be regarded as a fruit
of Buddhism. Its roots are primarily to be found in the Japanese
national spirit, indigenously occasioned and already strongly
developed long before contact with Buddhism. When Buddhist
influence began to be felt, the native character was fertile soil. The
Japanese could not but regard Buddhism as suitable, as spiritually
congenial, and so all that remained was to see this natural feature of
the Japanese character sanctioned by Buddhism, and to sensibly
subsume it from then on into an enduring harmony. The result has
been far-reaching.
It is for the Japanese person obvious not only to fit himself smoothly
into his appropriate position in society, but what is more to offer the
sacrifice of his own existence with calm resignation. Here the fruit of
Buddhist influence and of the implicit educational value of the arts
founded upon it becomes clear: from this inner light, death, even
self-immolation for the sake of the fatherland, gains its sublime
consecration and loses all its terror. The absorption demanded by
Buddhism and all real artistic endeavor implies, simply speaking, the
ability to take leave of the world and of oneself, to become Nothing
and because of that to be immensely fulfilled. When frequently
practiced and actually experienced, not as a completely understood
concept, not as a final conscious decision, but lived as true being in
Non-being, it brings that calm security which little fears and
consciously enters into death itself as into absorption. Then whether
human existence is annihilated only for moments until
countermanded, or forever, in both cases it remains rapture in the
fulfillment of being in Non-being.
Herein also lies the root of that knightly spirit which the Japanese



consider rightly to be theirs and whose purest symbol is the cherry
blossom petal, which detaches itself in the rays of the morning sun:
to be able to free oneself in such a way from existence, noiselessly
and innerly unmoving, fulfills and reveals not the sole, but indeed the
ultimate significance of all existence, whose end glides subtly into
the beginning.
This effort of mine to shine some light on the spirit of archery, even
though it offers only scant indications, is an attempt to 'hit' the
innermost being of mysticism.



Awa Kenzō (1880–1939)
Memoirs of Sōzō Komachiya
Herrigel and Master Awa (An account by Professor Komachiya)
(Translated from Martin, Michel, Kyudo: Un Tir, Une Vie, Editions
Amphora, 1990 (pp. 183-192) by Lutgard Cunningham and Charles



Harper. Translation copyright 2003. All rights reserved.)
I remember it was around the spring of 1926 that Mr. Herrigel came
to see me and said that he would like to study archery. He asked me
to introduce him to Master Awa, the famous archery champion. I
asked him the reason for this sudden decision; I was surprised that
this idea had come to him: even for Japanese, archery is a difficult
art. He told me that having been in Japan for three years, he had
realized how much he could learn through Japanese culture. In his
opinion, Buddhism, in particular Zen, had a great influence on
Japanese thought, and he thought that the shortest route to
initiating himself into Buddhism was to study archery.
"Since I arrived in Japan with my wife, we have lived daily with the
Japanese. I think that it is very important for me to understand
Japanese culture as accurately and completely as possible. One
often encounters foreigners who, although they have lived here for a
long time, have never been able to understand the Japanese way of
life; it has seemed very difficult to compare it to the customs of their
native country. 'In Rome, do as the Romans do'-- if you do not follow
this maxim, life becomes insipid, narrow and impoverished. This is
why I have let my wife take lessons in painting and flower
arrangement. And when the professor of floral art comes to our
home, I listen to what he has to say, too. Now we would like to study
archery together."
Those are the motives he gave me and, turning to me, added, "When
the professor of floral art comes, my friend Professor Chiba is our
interpreter, and we are very grateful that he goes to this trouble.
Would you perhaps be willing to act as our interpreter with the
archery professor?"
These words led me to believe that the source of this sudden



passion for archery was the master of floral art, Mr. Takeda, because
he was a friend of Mr. Awa; and in order to explain the art of floral
arrangement, one often uses expressions taken from archery: the
two have essentially the same spiritual foundations.
I immediately went to see Mr. Awa at the place where he practiced,
near Itsutsubashi in Higashiniban-cho, and I let him know of Mr.
Herrigel's desire. Against all expectations and without beating
around the bush, he refused because, he said, he had tried
previously to initiate many foreigners into the art of archery, but with
no success. "I am very sorry, but no," he answered. "Foreigners
consider archery a sport or a gymnastic skill, they do not understand
the spirit. I try at length to explain it to them, but in vain. Foreigners
are certainly able to understand the true spirit, if they are patient. But
they cannot wait for the right moment to come, they grow tired very
early and give up. That is why I do not want to make a new attempt
which also will be in vain." I agreed completely with Mr. Awa, and yet I
tried to explain at length to him that Mr. Herrigel certainly had no
intention of making it a sport or skill, but sincerely wanted to be
initiated into the Japanese spirit. Mr. Awa fell silent for a moment,
and then said, "I am willing to grant him his desire. But you will serve
as interpreter and you will be answerable for Mr. Herrigel."
Naturally, I accepted his condition, first because my friend Herrigel
had himself asked me to do this, and also because according to the
tradition of the art, one must accede to the wishes of the master.
Then I asked Mr. Awa what his fee would be. I knew this question
could seem impolite in Japanese custom, but Mr. Herrigel thought
like a European, and had asked me to do this. The Master responded
immediately, "No, because I am very happy to teach this art to such
a distinguished foreigner, a philosopher, and I am also convinced that
he will understand its true spirit. However, I would sooner refuse to
instruct than accept a fee."



I passed his statements on word for word to Mr. Herrigel, who
seemed to be a little uneasy. I also tried to explain to him that we
Japanese had a very particular sentiment on the point, quite our
own, and that he need not insist on paying a fee.
Thereupon, we three went once a week, Mr. Herrigel, his wife and I,
to Mr. Awa's shooting range, each of us carrying a bow on his
shoulder.
It may seem a bit of a digression, but I would like to recount here
several things touching upon Master Awa.
It was probably the 43rd year of the Meiji period, that is to say, in
1910-- I do not recall the exact date-- that I began to practice
archery with Mr. Awa, a short time after my achieving 2-dan. In those
days, he taught archery at my school, but his reputation was not yet
that which he subsequently acquired. He had at that time a small
plot of land in Daini-chiyokotsu-cho. He had rented it from its
wealthy owner, and it was there that he practiced. Nevertheless, he
always came to shoot at our school. He was at that time about 30
years old, a lively young man. He used very strong bows, sometimes
the large, powerful bows resembling those kept in Shinto temples as
sacrificial offerings. In those days, he taught technique more than
the spirit of archery, and he was very strict with regard to form. He
also attached great importance to hitting the mark: he loved to
wager with us, when we shot at the target. Later, after I had left the
school, I met Mr. Awa again in 1924, when I had been called to a
professorship at Tohoku University. In the intervening years, archery
had become very popular and Mr. Awa had many students. But his
style of shooting had completely changed; it had become more
concentrated and spiritually mature. The Master no longer taught
technique, but mainly the spirit of the art of archery, and he attached
much less importance to whether or not the arrows hit the target. "At



each shot," he said, "one must be present with all one's spirit." And
he deepened his study daily in this direction. In this way his
pedagogic methods were gradually transformed.
In February of 1936, Master Awa spoke about kyudo on Sapporo
radio. If my memory serves me, I can give a rough summary of this
talk:
The famous archer Yangyuchi hit a weeping-willow leaf at 100 paces
in 100 consecutive shots. Then Confucius made 100 perfect shots,
all missing the target somewhat. This shows who had the better
understanding of the real spirit of archery. It is thus that the spirit fills
the entire universe, and those who watch kyudo are fascinated and
moved by this divine perfection.
The spirit of archery is not contained within the art of hitting the
target like Yangyuchi, but in the perfection of Confucius' shooting.
Shooting is a way of perfecting your character. Thus, by practicing
with the bow, you can complete your character, and with each shot,
the complete personality should be united with the universe.
The ancient sages, the saints, sought in kyudo the virtue of grasping
their own consciousness and they thought in this way to perfect their
human worth. Archery today should also be this way. To each shot,
you must commit all your being, to each shot you must give yourself
completely. You should not differentiate between real life and
archery; for both, there exists but a single truth. In each shot, you
must renew your existence and reintegrate it into the universe,
because it is only in uniting your being with the universe that this
being becomes real. It is for this that the goal of the archer is to
elevate his character and train his spirit in aiming for himself. It is
also the reason why he must stress not the technique but the spirit.
The true calling of archery is therefore to acquire more influence



over your own spirit, making it more knightly and so more humane,
and in this fashion to produce more true sages and saints.
To cite the philosophy of Yangtzu, 'When with the bow one
stimulates the spirit, and when with the arrow one concentrates the
spirit, considering the target to be Truth, and when one shoots with
veneration, one invariably hits the mark.' When you begin to study
archery, you must train your mind so that the shot is identified with
the spirit, and try hard to influence your companions by the grace of
the spirit of archery, and through this endeavor to guide your fellow
man.
According to Master Awa, the following are the four principles of
archery:
(1) Archery should be a way, through its movements and changes, to
train and perfect the whole person, body and spirit, and at the same
time attain the true state of the soul that frees the body and spirit.
(2) Through the moral training of archery, everyone joins in a spiritual
friendship that is the Japanese spirit, which descends from samurai
virtue, and training will advance this friendship, demonstrating to the
world its greatness.
(3) The archer must realize that when he practices archery, he
becomes more perfect in deepening his knowledge and experience,
and he should be uniquely attentive to this deepening, never taking it
lightly.
(4) The archer is an embodiment of divine knowledge, so he should
neither speak much nor make any unproductive effort. Practiced
correctly, the tanden (that is to say, the center) should nourish the
divine force which everyone carries within.



M. Martins note: In the Buddhist conception, the tanden is mans
spiritual center, situated under the navel (in representations of the
Buddha, it is often indicated by a lotus). From this area originates all
spiritual and physical force, and the basic exercise consists in
concentrating on the precise tension of the abdominal muscles.
Through these principles, we can get some idea of the conception of
kyudo that the Master had near the end of his life.
Each time that Mr. Herrigel and his wife came to Master Awa's
shooting range, it was arranged that no one else would be there, and
it was only on rare occasions that he authorized any of his favorite
students to be present. Master Awa did this so that Mr. Herrigel,
without distraction or embarrassment, could concentrate on
shooting. In order that Mrs. Herrigel's training could be more
pleasant for her, the Master's wife accompanied Mrs. Herrigel's
movements in order to help her. It seems that Madam Awa had an
equally profound understanding of this art.
The first day, Master Awa performed a ceremonial shooting at a
straw bale, in this way beginning the training of his new student (the
method is of course the same for Japanese students). Master Awa
then placed him in front of this target, set his feet correctly and had
him hold the bow as he should. He then taught him to regulate his
breathing, to breath deeply and sense the muscles of his abdomen.
After these various preliminaries, the Master let his student shoot for
the first time at the straw bale. Mr. Herrigel's style was maladroit at
first, of course, just as it is for Japanese beginners.
After several shots, the first day's training ended, and each week the
same training was repeated. The Master attached particular
importance to the regularity of the breath. This was something very
difficult for Mr. Herrigel to understand. He always said, "The breath



passes through the lungs. It is physiologically impossible to press the
air down from the lungs into the abdomen." But the Master often
repeated that, in order to understand the spirit of the Japanese
samurai, this exercise was fundamental. "You have to do this
exercise without arguing from logic." Saying this, he grabbed
Herrigel's bow, guided his arms through the preparatory moves, and
stepped back. Herrigel was now standing, the bow strained, and
awaiting a command to shoot. "Not yet," said the Master and Herrigel
began to tremble from the effort that he was making. "Not yet,"
repeated the Master, striking him on the abdomen with the palm of
his hand. "Make an effort! Tighten up the abdominal muscles," he
cried. And when the bow was completely drawn, "Exhale completely,
but don't inhale and don't shoot yet." Now and again, the Master
approached and put his ear up to his student's nose to verify that he
was not inhaling. He slapped his abdomen and repeated, "Not yet,
not yet! Patience. Hang on!"
This exercise must have been very difficult for Mr. Herrigel. He
complained, saying he was exhausted and absolutely at the end of
his strength, unable to hold his bow. To this complaint the Master
responded, "When you speak like that, it proves that you want to act,
you help your physical strength. This is now forbidden in real archery.
To shoot well, you must forget all your physical strength. You must
shoot only with the force of your spirit."
Here, Mr. Herrigel's thinking reached an impasse. It was a critical
point: he could advance no further, and when he stopped advancing,
he lost ground. Herrigel thought that the bow, through the force of
its elasticity, was the method by which the arrow reached the target.
For it to get there, it had to use the strength of the entire body.
'When you abandon your strength,' he reasoned, "you become
feeble, paralyzed. I cannot understand it differently." He was
tremendously upset by this problem for a long time. When the



Master ordered him to give up his strength, I translated it by ........... [
M.Martin's note: left blank in the original manuscript ] and we
sometimes had bitter words with each other.
Shortly after the beginning of his training, Mr. Herrigel asked for a
straw bale, and he began practicing in his office several times a day.
Therefore he did not come more than once a week to Master Awa's;
but nevertheless, he eventually made good progress. At the end of
about a year, he had acquired near mastery of the tanden exercise,
and knew how to shoot without using his physical strength; and at
about the same time he was equally successful in performing
'hanare' without releasing, which he already did well.
Master Awa, wishing to speak directly to Mr. Herrigel, acquired a few
words of German. When Mr. Herrigel shot poorly, he immediately
cried, "No good!" and assumed a very irate pose. But when Mr.
Herrigel occasionally succeeded in a good shot, he cried, "Great,
remarkable, brilliant!" Perhaps because the first of these words
seemed easier to pronounce, he adopted it and I remember that
when he said it, he shook Mr. Herrigel's hand. When he was
particularly happy with him, the Master, who was quite a big man,
would hug his student, as large as he was, and lift him with
enthusiasm in order to show how satisfied he was.
In these circumstances, if Herrigel was not all that convinced that he
had shot well, he would ask me, "Was it really good?" And almost
always I could concur with the Master.
Master Awa did not flatter his students and told the truth without
embellishment. On the other hand, Master Awa was very amicable,
and took a lot of pains in teaching them.
However, on the important points he became very serious,
remembering that he had before him a foreign student, and, scolding



him often, he cried in a strong voice, "No more!" On some of the
same days of severity, he said very simply, "Today everything was
bad. He had better quit," and he would not let Mr. Herrigel shoot any
more. But Herrigel was never impatient and he did not show any
annoyance at all. He never answered back or argued.
Once a student of Mr. Herrigel's came to the training hall, and the
Master gave him a lesson and a demonstration of the exercise. After
he had shot three or four arrows, the Master suddenly slapped him
across the face. The student turned very pale and tried a shot once
more, and this time the Master cried, "Good!" And thereupon the
Master and the student finished the practice in a jovial, a very merry
atmosphere.
Mr. Herrigel had observed this scene with great attention, so I asked
him, "Does there exist in Europe any equivalent? Can you understand
such an attitude?" He answered, "Actually, nothing like this exists in
our country, but I understand very well this sort of rapport between
master and student."
If sometimes the Master said, "Today nothing has been good, he had
better quit," he always waited calmly afterward for Mr. Herrigel to put
away his equipment, and then said patiently and amicably, "Archery
is not just a technique, it is outside logic. Waiting for the shot, the
self should unite with the universe. Each shot one must shoot with
his entire being. Each archer must arrive at a point where he tries so
hard that all his being depends on one shot. That is why each shot is
a 'shot to the death'. To attain this, one is at his highest, one must
give the most he has." And he ended solemnly, saying that to shoot
correctly is the true way of Zen.
It is in this way that the Master pursued his teaching. In each
exercise, he went over the principle that the art of archery is not a



technique, but a way of attaining illumination. And he also often used
in his teachings epigrams that he took spontaneously from Zen.
When he became passionate, he suddenly began to sketch with
chalk on the blackboard hanging on the wall of the training room, in
order to try to explain something to Mr. Herrigel. Once, he sketched
the silhouette of an archer inside a large circle. "This archer, Mr.
Herrigel," he said, "must tighten his tanden in order to attain the
circle of 'muga', his not-self, and become one with the universe."
However, it sometimes happened that the Master expressed
contradictions. In these cases, I remained silent, not translating
anything of what he had said. This silence was enough to attract Mr.
Herrigel's attention, and he asked me, very curious, "What did the
Master say?" This sometimes embarrassed me.
Feeling extremely guilty, I answered, "Nothing in particular. He only
stressed his remark that a shot is one's complete being; that to
shoot a hundred times is a holy action. He is just repeating." I
sometimes tried to avoid embarrassment with such responses. In my
opinion, the Master gave at these times poor enhancement to
making the spirit of archery comprehensible, and in his eager
willingness to express the eternal Way, he employed conflicting Zen
thoughts without realizing it; he practiced in contradiction to his own
words. I therefore hope that my politics of silence will be excused by
the Master as well as by his student.
The training at Mr. Awa's home consisted most often in shooting at
the hay bale; but each time that Mr. Herrigel made some progress,
the Master let him approach the real target. At the beginning of his
training, Mr. Herrigel was perplexed and impatient when set before
the target. Although the Master had said, "Let the target alone for
the moment", Mr. Herrigel often asked him, "Why, with the skill that I
have acquired, do I not shoot at the target?"



The Master answered each time, "It is necessary to practice first
before shooting at the target. One cannot move from the practice
bale to the target without long preparation."
When Mr. Herrigel was allowed to shoot at the target, Master Awa
always said, "You should be cautious. You should not aim to hit the
mark. You should not think about the mark when you release the
arrow." He never forgot to issue this warning before the student
addressed the target. And often he added, "To hit the target a
hundred times is banal. But in shooting a hundred times, shoot well a
hundred times: this is a holy act. With this, you can say that when
you succeed in a hundred shots, you have done it with the spirit of
archery, that is, shooting like Confucius." Such an idea was
incomprehensible to Mr. Herrigel. For him, the bow was a means of
hitting the target. The target is an object. When a person shoots, he
must think that he can hit this object. He must always have a
determined intention in shooting. But when we say that a shot exists
without an intention, a point of departure that does not point toward
the target, this cannot be a result of miscommunication. For this
reason, Mr. Herrigel said to me, "The Japanese manner of thinking is
completely opposite to that of the European. For the European, all
this is incomprehensible. To accept Japanese thought, one must
completely revise his own conceptions." And he wondered whether
this fundamental difference did not partake of the remarkable
Japanese intuition.
It may be that Mr. Herrigel, from this moment, abandoned his
previous way of thinking, to give himself over to intensifying the spirit
of archery. Until this, he had regarded everything from the European
point of view. Now, he took pains to see things from the Japanese
viewpoint. At least, I had this impression of him. And from this time,
the Master more and more often used the word, 'impressive' when
Mr. Herrigel was in front of the hay bale or the target. At this time



also, Mr. Herrigel less and less frequently said, 'incomprehensible' or
'incredible'. Little by little, his understanding deepened, and he
began to find relationships with the mystic tradition of the European
Middle Ages. He often spoke to me about this, and acknowledged
that the bow and the mark were in fact only a means of illumination.
"The bow does not exist for shooting at a target. When one shoots at
the target, it is as if one shot at oneself."
As a Christmas gift, he had a famous picture of Saint Hubert shipped
to the Master from Germany. The picture represents a knight
accompanied by a hunting dog which, at the edge of a forest, has
come face to face with a stag bearing between its antlers a cross
surmounted by a golden halo. The knight is kneeling in front of the
stag. Hubert was a nobleman in the first half of the 18th century who
like the other feudal lords of his epoch led an idle life and loved the
hunt. When he encountered the sacred stag, he had a vision of God,
renounced his life of debauchery and entered a monastery. He was
eventually canonized as Saint Hubert. The picture in question
represented the crucial moment in St. Hubert's life. I think that Mr.
Herrigel gave this picture to the Master believing that the instant
when St. Hubert sees the stag relates to the moment when the
archer comprehends the spirit of his art. The Master seemed to be
very proud of it and lost no time in hanging it on the wall of his
training hall.
As soon as Mr. Herrigel began shooting better, his interest deepened
and his ardour intensified. When leaving for his holidays, he took his
bow and his hay bale, and the friendship between master and pupil
solidified over time.
The Master felt that Mr. Herrigel, although a foreigner, had
understood the spirit of archery through the medium of his
philosophical thought; he was profoundly impressed and showed



that he held him in the utmost regard. On his side, Mr. Herrigel
honored Master Awa as a unique and incomparable teacher, and he
always remained a loyal disciple. The summer that Mr. Herrigel spent
his holidays at the beach at Takayama, the Master took the trouble to
join him, and in front of the hay bale they discussed archery in
broken German and Japanese.
Mr. Herrigel left Sendai in August 1929. At that time his shooting was
already very impressive. His form in front of the target had maturity
and he was approaching perfection, as he had before the hay bale.
Master Awa was quite delighted because he had a chance to spread
the spirit of the bow overseas as far as Europe; and Mr. Herrigel
promised not to abandon his training once he returned home. He
also wanted to make known in Europe the profundity of the Japanese
spirit which he had acquired from his understanding of archery and
from the grand master of that art. Master Awa awarded Herrigel a 5
dan certificate, the level, he thought, of his mastery of the art of
archery. This judgment he conferred unreservedly, although it was
upon a foreigner, and without having to modify in the least the scale
that he used. The fifth dan reflected exactly Mr. Herrigel's ability.
Master Awa and Mr. Herrigel felt a great sadness at the approach of
their separation, and the Master made a gift to his student of his
favorite sword, in memory of the ties that bound them. He offered
him this very precious sword as a sign of the pleasure of meeting a
foreigner who understood so well the true spirit of Japanese chivalry.
After his return to Germany, Mr. Herrigel often wrote to me and he
always reminded me of the fine keepsake from Master Awa, and
sometimes he added a word which he asked me to translate for
Master Awa. He told me that he was continuing his training without
interruption. Gaining more confidence in himself, he began to shoot
better than in Japan. He wanted to know whether Master Awa would



have an opportunity to travel to Germany. These last years, he wrote
me that he was afraid to be too sure of his own judgment and
therefore to be mistaken about his ability, having practiced such a
long time without the critical observation of his master; in Germany,
no one could criticize him as had been done in the past, and he
dreaded going astray into a method of his own invention.
This translation by Mr. Shibata is the text of a lecture that Mr.
Herrigel gave to the German-Japanese Society at the request of the
Berlin chapter. He had a copy sent to me via Mr. Furuuchi Hiroo and
asked for a critique from Master Awa. He also wished to know my
opinion. Master Awa informed me that he saw nothing to criticize in
the text, and that he was delighted to know that Japanese archery
was presented in such a remarkable manner to foreigners.
I immediately transmitted this message to Mr. Herrigel, who
responded that he was relieved and more confident in his own
judgment. I have always been of the opinion that the 5th dan, at the
time of his departure from Japan, corresponded precisely with his
capacity, but I never imagined that he had penetrated very deeply
into the spirit of archery. I looked through the text of his lecture. Just
as with Japanese, it is not at all easy, after such brief training, to
grasp the true spirit of archery very well, and it required the spirit of
a philosopher trained in logic in order to describe very clearly the
account of his training. I gave him my opinion on this point. Perhaps
he was not satisfied with my letter, because he wrote to me to find
out what criticisms I was expressing. Surprised by his seriousness
and passion, I responded that my previous letter contained all that I
thought on the subject. After a short time, he wrote again that his
lecture had been intended for a wide German audience which
wanted to get an idea of what archery was, but that he proposed
sooner or later to write a large work for initiates. With this intention,
he had made contact with an editor: regarding this book, he spoke in



detail of his venerable master and he also mentioned the effort that
Mr. Komachiya had made in serving as an interpreter between them.
In Mr. Herrigels lecture, there is an episode in which the Master
illuminates the darkness with a small stick of incense, then shoots
two arrows, the second of which hits the end of the first, and he
mentions some comments that Master Awa makes about this. That
night I was not present and so could not serve as interpreter. I think
that Mr. Herrigel, with his slight knowledge of Japanese but in real
empathy, had understood the Master; and I am amazed that without
interpretation one could understand things so difficult to explain. It is
undoubtedly in this lecture that he made an allusion to this
experience for the first time, because he had never before spoken of
it to me. Later, when I read the text of the lecture, I spoke of the
incident with Master Awa.
He answered with a very subtle smile, Yes, miracles really happen.
Unforeseeable chance produces such things. I was strongly
impressed by the calmness with which he assumed that it stood to
reason that he had never mentioned this to me, neither he nor Mr.
Herrigel, until the moment that I had the translation from Mr. Shibata.
When Master Awa died on March 1st, 1939 at the age of 59, I
informed Mr. Herrigel immediately. This news affected him deeply,
and he said that with all his heart he regretted this loss to Japan; he
asked me to express his profound sympathies to the deceaseds
family.
It was on the occasion of the Shibata translation that I noted down
these few thoughts that had come to mind and that I express in this
narrative. I have forgotten much, so many years have since gone by. I
have not retained anything except what has left a deep impression
on me, and I am transmitting such things as have presented



themselves to my memory, without any well-defined order.

J.D. Salinger's fictional character "Seymour Glass" applied one
aspect of Zen archery -- aiming by deliberately not taking aim -- to
playing the children's game of marbles. Excerpt from
Seymour: An Introduction
by J.D. Salinger
The New Yorker, June 6, 1959
Boston: Little, Brown, 1963
As I've said, he could be spectacularly good at certain games, too.
Unpardonably so, in fact. By that I mean there is a degree of
excellence in games or sports that we especially resent seeing
reached by an unorthodox opponent, a categorical 'bastard' of some
kind - a Formless Bastard, a Showy Bastard, or just a plain hundred
per-cent American bastard, which, of course, runs the gamut from
somebody who uses cheap or inferior equipment against us with
great success all the way down the line to a winning contestant who
has an unnecessarily happy, good face. Only one of Seymour's
crimes, when lie excelled at games, was Formlessness, but it was a
major one. I'm thinking of three games especially: stoopball, curb
marbles, and pocket pool. (Pool I'll have to discuss another time. It
wasn't just a game with its, it was almost a protestant reformation.
We shot pool before or after almost every important crisis of our
young manhood.) Stoopball, for the information of rural readers, is a
ball game played with the support of a flight of brownstone steps or
the front of an apartment building. As we played it, a rubber ball was
thrown against solve architectural granite fancywork - a popular



Manhattan mixture of Greek Ionic and Roman Corinthian molding
along the facade of our apartment house, about waist-high. If the
ball rebounded into the street or over to the far sidewalk and wasn't
caught on the fly by someone on the opposing team, it counted as
an infield hit, as in baseball; if it was caught - and this was more
usual than not - the player was counted out. A home run was scored
only when the ball sailed just high and hard enough to strike the wall
of the building across the street without being caught on the
bounce-off. In our day, quite a few balls used to reach the opposite
wall on the fly, but very few fast, low, and choice enough so that they
couldn't be handled on the fly. Seymour scored a home run nearly
every time he was up. When other boys on the block scored one, it
was generally regarded as a fluke - pleasant or unpleasant,
depending on whose team you were on - but Seymour's failures to
get home runs looked like. flukes. Still more singular, and rather more
to the point of this discussion, lie threw the ball like no one else in
the neighborhood. The rest of us, if we were normally right-handed,
as he was, stood a little to the left of the ripply striking surfaces and
let fly with a hard sidearm motion. Seymour faced the crucial area
and threw straight down at it - a motion very like his unsightly and
abominably unsuccessful overhand smash at ping-pang or tennis
and the ball zoomed back over his head, with a minimum of ducking
on his part, straight for the bleachers, as it were. If you tried doing it
his way (whether in private or under his positively zealous personal
instruction), either you made an easy out or the (goddam) ball flew
back and stung you in the face. There came a tine when no one on
the block would play stoopball with him - not even myself. Very
often, then, lie either spent some tine explaining the. fine points of
the game to one of our sisters or turned it into an exceedingly
effective game of solitaire, with the rebound from the opposite
building lining back to him in such a way that he didn't have to
change his footing to catch it on the trickle-in. (Yes, yes, I'm making



too damned much of this, but I find the whole business irresistible,
after nearly thirty years.) He was the same kind of heller at curb
marbles. In curb marbles, the first player rolls or pitches his marble,
his shooter, twenty or twenty-five feet along the edge of a side street
where there are no cars parked, keeping his marble quite close to
the curb. The second player then tries to hit it, shooting from the
same starting line. It was rarely done, since almost anything could
deflect a marble from going straight to its mark: the unsmooth street
itself, a bad bounce against the curb, a wad of chewing gum, any one
of a hundred typical New York side-street droppings - not to mention
just plain, everyday lousy aim. If the second player missed with his
first shot, his marble usually came to rest in a very vulnerable, close
position for the first player to shoot at on his second turn. Eighty or
ninety times out of a hundred, at this game, whether he shot first or
last, Seymour was unbeatable. On long shots, he curved his marble
at yours in a rather wide arc, like a bowling shot from the far-right
side of the foul line. Here, too, his stance, his forth, was maddeningly
irregular. Where everybody else on the block made his long shot with
an underhand toss, Seymour dispatched his marble with a sidearm
or, rather, a sidewrist - flick, vaguely like someone scaling a flat
stone over a pond. And again imitation was disastrous. To do it his
way was to lose all chance of any effective control over the marble.
I think a part of my mind has been vulgarly laying for this next bit. I
haven't thought of it in years and years.
One late afternoon, at that faintly soupy quarter of an hour in New
York when the street lights have just been turned on and the parking
lights of cars are just getting turned on - some on, some still off- I
was playing curb marbles with a boy named Ira Yankauer, on the
farther side of the side street just opposite the canvas canopy of our
apartment house. I was eight. I was using Seymour's technique, or
trying to - his side flick, his way of widely curving his marble at the



other guy's - and I was losing steadily. Steadily but painlessly. For it
was the time of day when New York City boys are much like Tiffin,
Ohio, boys who hear a distant train whistle just as the last cow is
being driven into the barn. At that magic quarter hour, if you lose
marbles, you lose just marbles. Ira, too, I think, was properly time
suspended, and if so, all he could have been winning was marbles.
Out of this quietness, and entirely in key with it, Seymour called to
me. It came as a pleasant shock that there was a third person in the
universe, and to this feeling was added the justness of its being
Seymour. I turned around, totally, and I suspect Ira must have, too.
The bulby bright lights had just gone on under the canopy of our
house. Seymour was standing on the curb edge before it, facing us,
balanced on his arches, his hands in the slash pockets of his sheep
lined coat. With the canopy lights behind him, his face was
shadowed, dimmed out. He was ten. From the way he was balanced
on the curb edge, from the position of his hands, from - well, the
quantity x itself, I knew as well then as I know now that he was
immensely conscious himself of the magic hour of the day. 'Could
you try not aiming so much?' he asked me, still standing there. 'If you
hit him when you aim, it'll just be luck.' He was speaking,
communicating, and yet not breaking the spell. I then broke it. Quite
deliberately. 'How can it be luck if I aim ?' I said back to him, not loud
(despite the italics) but with rather more irritation in my voice than I
was actually feeling. He didn't say anything for a moment but simply
stood balanced on the curb, looking at me, I knew imperfectly, with
love. 'Because it will be,' he said. 'You'll be glad if you hit his marble
Ira's marble - won't you? Won't you be glad ? And if you're glad when
you hit somebody's marble, then you sort of secretly didn't expect
too much to do it. So there'd have to be some luck in it, there'd have
to be slightly quite a lot of ac cident in it.' He stepped down off the
curb, his hands still in the slash pockets of his coat, and came over
to us. But a thinking Seymour didn't cross a twilit street quickly, or



surely didn't seem to. In that light, he came toward us much like a
sailboat. Pride, on the other hand, is one of the fastest-moving
things in this world, and before he got within five feet of us, I said
hurriedly to Ira, 'It's getting dark anyway,' effectively breaking tip the
game.

A japán íjászat és más keleti országokban gyakorolt művészetek
lényeges tényezője, hogy sem esztétikai sem kézzelfogható célt
nem szolgálnak. Rendeltetésük a tudat iskolázása, kapcsolatba
hozása a végső valósággal. A japánok nem csak azért gyakorolják
az íjazást, hogy eltalálják ellenfelüket; a táncos nem csupán azért



táncol, hogy teste ritmikus mozgást végezzen, de elsősorban
azért, hogy tudata harmonizáljon tudatalattijával.
Hogy valaki az íjazás mestere legyen kevés a technikai tudás.
Hogy tudása a tudattalanból sarjadó „nem-tudatos művészetté"
váljék, felül kell emelkednie a technikán.
Az íjazás vonatkozásából ez azt jelenti, hogy az íjász és céltábla
nem egymással szembenálló két dolog, hanem egyetlen valóság.
Az íjász nem érzi „föladatának" a céltábla eltalálását. A nem
tudatosságnak (ösztönösségnek) állapota azonban csak úgy
érhető el, ha énje fölszabadult, ha azonosult technikai
ügyességével.
Az ilyen, a szokványostól eltérő eredmény a satori. Intuícióról is
beszélhetnénk, de ennél magasabb rendű. Helyesnek vélem, ha
prajñā-intuíciónak nevezzük. A prajñā szó jelentése transcendens
bölcsesség; olyan intuíció, amely egyszerre ismeri föl a dolgok
egészét és egyediségét (totalitását és individualitását). Olyan
intuíció, amely elmélkedés nélkül fölismeri, hogy a 0 =
végtelennel, hogy a végtelen = 0-val; fölismerése azonban nem
szimbolikus vagy matematikai gondolkodás eredménye, hanem
közvetlen tapasztalás gyümölcse.
A satori tehát az én határán túli világ tapasztalása. Logikai
szempontból bepillantás az igenlés és tagadás szintézisébe,
metafizikai nyelven intuitív átélése annak, hogy lenni = létrejönni
és létrejönni = lenni.
A zen, és minden más vallási-, filozófiai vagy misztikus tanítás
közti döntő különbséget ama tény jelenti, hogy a zen soha nem
különül el mindennapi életünktől, de praktikus alkalmazási
lehetősége és konkrét volta mellett mégis tartalmaz valamit, ami a
világ nyughatatlan és fertőző színjátékából kiemelkedik.
Ez a pont képezi az összefüggést a zen és íjászat, vagy a többi
művészet, mint a virágkötés, teaszertartás, tánc, stb. között.
A zen a „napi tudat" ahogy Baso (Mazu Daoyi, megh. 788)



mondotta. Ez nem jelent mást, mint „egyél, ha éhes vagy", „aludj,
ha fáradt vagy".
Ha töprengünk, fontolgatunk, fogalmakat alkotunk elvész az, ami
eredetileg ösztönös volt bennünk, és fölmerül egy gondolat. A
táplálkozás már nem étkezés, és ha alszunk, az nem lesz alvás.
Az íj nem talál a céltábla közepébe, de maga a céltábla sem áll a
helyén.
Az ember bár gondolkodó lény, de nagy műveit akkor hozza létre,
ha nem fontolgat. „Gyermekségét" az önfeledtség művészetének
hosszú gyakorlásával kell visszanyernie. Aki visszanyerte, az
gondolatok nélkül gondolkodik, cselekszik mint a felhőből aláhulló
eső, az egymást űző hullámok a tengeren; gondolata olyan, mint
az éjben világító csillag, mint a tavaszi szélben sarjadó lomb. Ő
maga immár az eső, a tenger, a csillag és a zöldülő természet.
Aki elérte a „szellemi" fejlődés eme fokát, a lét zen-mesterévé
vált. Ezután nincs szüksége ecsetre és tusra, íjra és céltáblára,
hiszen eszközei tulajdon feje, teste és végtagjai. Zen-létét
ezekkel a „szerszámokkal" fejezi ki. Keze és lába az ecset, vászna
a világegyetem. Életét erre festi, és műve maga a történelem.
Hôsen (Fengxian Daochen, megh. 1104) így beszél: „Íme a férfiú,
aki a tér ürességét papírlappá, a tengert tussá, a Sumerut ecsetté
változtatta, fölírván az öt szótagot: so-shi-sai-rai-i.1/ Néki
ajándékozom a zagum-at2/ és mély meghajlással köszöntöm."
Kérdezhetnénk, mi e különös szöveg értelme? Egy zen-mester
valószínűleg így válaszolna: „Eszem, ha éhes vagyok, alszom, ha
elfáradtam".
Könyvünkben Herrigel professzor - aki Japánban, hogy a zent
megértse az íj és nyíl ösvényét járta - ad tapasztalatairól ihletett
beszámolót.
ELSŐ PILLANTÁSRA lebecsülésnek tűnik ha a zent - bármit is
értsünk alatta - az íjazással hozunk kapcsolatba. Még ha



messzemenő engedékenységgel egyet is értünk azzal, hogy az
íjászatot „művészetnek" tekintsük, aligha leszünk képesek sportbeli
tudásnál egyebet is keresni mögötte. Ám ez az értékelés arra csábit,
hogy megismerjük a japán műlövészek csodálatos eredményeit,
annál is inkább, mivel az íj és nyíl használatában ősi és
megszakítatlan hagyományra hivatkoznak. Csak néhány emberöltő
múlt el azóta, hogy a régi harci eszközöket a modern fegyverek
kiszorították, de a japánok soha nem hagytak föl forgatásukkal, sőt
napjainkban is egyre többen törekszenek azok mesterévé válni.
Természetes tehát hogy ha a japán íjazásról van szó, ama sajátos
módszernek ismertetését várjuk, mellyel Japánban az íjászatot ma is
mint nemzeti sportot űzik. Leginkább mégis e reményünkben
csalatkozunk. A japán ember a hagyományos értelemben vett íjászat
alatt, melyet művészetnek tekint és ősi örökségként tisztel, nem
sportot, hanem - bármilyen különösnek hangzik - kultikus cselekvést
ért. Ilyenformán számára az íjazás művészete nem fizikai
gyakorlással többé-kevésbé elsajátítható sport-tudást jelent, hanem
olyan ismeretet, melynek eredetét szellemi gyakorlatokban kell
keresnünk, és melynek célja „szellemi találat": a lövész önmagát
veszi célba és eljuthat odáig, hogy el is találja önmagát.
Különösnek tűnhet, hogy az egykor harci célból gyakorolt íjászatot
nem sportként, hanem valamiféle szellemi gyakorlatként mentették
át a jelenbe. Mire szolgál akkor az íj, a nyíl és a céltábla? Nem
tagadták-e meg az íjászat egyértelmű célját, és nem
helyettesítették-e be ezt a régi férfias művészetet valami homályos
és fantasztikus dologgal?
A kérdésekre határozott nem-mel felelhetünk. Ha utánanézünk, azt
látjuk, hogy amióta nem véres vitákat kell eldöntenie, koncentráltan
és meggyőzően mutatkozik meg e művészet sajátos szelleme. Az a
szellem, melyet nem utólag magyaráztak bele, hanem amely
mindenkor sajátja volt. Szó sincs arról, hogy az íjazás hagyományos
gyakorlata derűs időtöltéssé, „ártatlan játékká" alakult volna át, mióta



a harcban nincs szerepe.
Az íjazás „Nagy Tana" mást mond föntiekről: az íjazás, miként régen,
úgy ma is élet-halál kérdése; nevezetesen az íjász küzdelme
önmagával. És e harc nem a „valódi" csökevényes pótléka, hanem
egyenrangú ama küzdelemmel, amit szembenálló ellenséggel vívunk.
Az önmagunkkal vívott harcban mutatkozik meg az íjazás
művészetének rejtett lényege, ezért ma sem marad ki belőle semmi
alapvetően fontos, bárha az íjász nem úgy hasznosítja tudását, mint
egykor, amikor azt a lovagi harcok szelleme megkívánta.
Aki ma szenteli magát e művészetnek, a történelem alakulásából
vitathatatlanul megvan ama előnye, hogy a „Nagy Tan"
megértésében nem gátolhatja az esetleg önmagának sem bevallott
gyakorlati célkitűzés. Az „ösvényen" ugyanis - ebben minden idők
íjászmesterei egyetértettek - csak azok a „tiszta szívűek" képesek
haladni, akiket nem zavar önös szándék.
A kérdést ily szemszögből fölvetve, hogyan látják és közlik a japán
mesterek az íjász önmagával vívott harcát? A válasz több mint
talányos. A harc - szerintük- abban áll, hogy az íjász önmagát és
mégsem önmagát veszi célba, hogy aztán önmagát és mégsem
önmagát találja el. Így válik egyben célzóvá és céllá, találóvá és
eltalálttá. Vagy hogy klasszikus kifejezéssel éljünk: „tevékenység
közepette mozdulatlan központnak maradni". Mert ekkor következik
be az áhított eredmény: a lövés nem-lövéssé, vagy inkább íj és nyíl
nélküli lövéssé válik. E ponton a tanító ismét tanítvány, a mester
ismét kezdő lesz; a vég kiindulóponttá, a kezdet beteljesüléssé válik.
Japán ember nem ütközik meg az elmondottakon, a nyugatiak
legalábbis tanácstalanok. Már jó ideje a nyugatiak előtt sem titok,
hogy a japán művészetek lényege a buddhizmusban gyökerezik.
Vonatkozik ez az íjászatra éppen úgy, mint a tusfestésre,
színjátszásra, tea - szertartásra, virágkötésre és kardvívásra. Ez
elsősorban azt jelenti, hogy a fölsoroltak mindegyike föltételez egy
megfelelő és tudatosan ápolt szellemi magatartást, amely



emelkedettebb formájában az ami a buddhista szerzetest jellemzi.
Viszont nem arról a buddhizmusról van szó, melyet hozzáférhető
irodalmából Nyugaton ismernek, hanem' az ú.n. „Dhyāna"
buddhizmusról, mely japánban mint „zen" gyakoroltatik. A zen
mindenekelőtt nem spekuláció, hanem közvetlen tapasztalás.
Megismerés, amelyet nem az 'értelem közvetít, hanem az intuíció és
ezért szavakkal pontosan ki sem fejezhető: az ember tudás nélkül
tudja. E döntő tapasztalás érdekében lép oly útra a zen, amely
módszeresen qyakorolt magunkba merüléssel a megnevezhetetlen
eredethez vezet. A cél a jelző nélküli legbensővel való egyesülés.
Ez az íjászatra vonatkoztatva - persze esetleges és ezért
megfontolandó megállapítással - oly szellemi gyakorlatok végzését
jelenti, amelyeknek köszönhető, hogy az íjászat technikája
művészetté válik. Végeredményben íj és nyíl csak „ürügyül" szolgál
olyasminek ami íj és nyíl hiányában is létrejöhetne. Ösvény a cél felé,
illetve csak az utolsó döntő lépés segédeszköze.
Mivel ez a helyzet, semmi nem volna kívánatosabb, minthogy a
mélyebb megértés kedvéért a zen-buddhisták fejtegetéseihez
tartsuk magunkat. Ilyenekkel pedig rendelkezünk: D.T. Suzuki,
„Essays of Zen-Buddhism" c. munkájában azt törekszik bizonyítani,
hogy a japán kultúra és a zen szorosan összefügg egymással,
nevezetesen, hogy a japán művészetek, a szamuráj szellemi
magatartása, a japán életstílus, a japán ember morális, esztétikai, sőt
intellektuális életformája is a zenen alapul, és ezért akik
bensőségesen nem ismerik nem is érthetik eléggé.
Suzuki művei, és más japán tudósok vizsgálódásai jogos föltünést
keltettek. Általában elismerik, hogy az Indiában keletkezett Dhyāna
buddhizmus döntő átalakulás után Kínában érte el érettségét. Ezt a
formát vette át Japán, és napjainkig hagyományként ápolja.
Ám a zen tolmácsolóinak minden fáradozása ellenére a bepillantás a
lényegbe a nyugatiak számára mégis elégtelen. A sejtve-megnyíló
átérzés már kezdetben akadályokba ütközik. A zen továbbra is



talányként hat amely megoldhatatlannak tűnik, de ennek ellenére
ellenállhatatlanul vonzó.
A hozzáférhetetlenség okát részben ama fejtegetések stílusában
kereshetjük, amellyel a zent ez idáig közvetítették. Aki a zen lényegét
megközelíti, többé nem fogja megkívánni hogy a zen-értő ama
tapasztalatokat, amelyek átalakították és fölszabadították, azt az
elgondolhatatlan és kimondhatatlan „igazságot" leírni, körülírni
megkísérelje. A zen e szempontból rokon az elmélyedés
misztikájával. Aki nem volt misztikus tapasztalás részese, bárhová is
forduljon, kívül marad. Ez alól a törvény alól nincs kivétel. Nem mond
ellent ennek a szentnek tartott zen-iratok bősége sem. E művek
ugyanis csak annak nyitják meg életet adó értelmüket, aki a döntő
tapasztalásra méltó, és így e szövegekből annak igazolását olvassa
ki, amivel már rendelkezik. A tapasztalatlan számára nemcsak rejtve
maradnak e szövegek mondanivalói, de szellemi tévútra is
vezethetik, még akkor is, ha óvatosan és önfeledt magaátadással
közelít. A zent - mint minden misztikát - csak az képes megérteni,
aki maga is misztikus, és ezért nem kerülhet kísértésbe, hogy más
úton próbálja megkaparintani azt, amihez csak misztikus tapasztalás
révén juthat.
Már a kezdet legelején rádöbben a tanítvány, hogy mennyi mindent
kell leküzdenie, maga mögött hagynia, hogy rátalálhasson az
igazságra. Hányszor kínozza majd a vigasztalan érzés, hogy
elérhetetlen cél felé törekszik. De egy napon mégis lehetségessé,
sőt magától érthetővé válik a „lehetetlen". Nem helyénvaló tehát a
kérdés: "Merjünk-e nekivágni?"
Az út és állomásai leírása azonban nem szerepel a zen irodalmában.
A mester tiltakozik az ellen, hogy ő mutassa meg az üdvösséghez
vezető utat. Tapasztalatból tudja, hogy a lelkiismeretes vezetés
ellenére, a helyes irányt a tanítvány kell föllelje. Ezért kerül a tanító
minden önmagáról, átalakulása menetéről szóló beszámolót. Már az
is komoly próbatétel számára, hogy a zenről „beszéljen". Hogy „mi a



zen", arról a mesterek szerint csak hallgatással lehet válaszolni.
E sorok írója azonban arra törekszik, hogy úgy közvetítse a zen
lényegét, hogy azt mutatja be, hogyan hat egy olyan művészetben,
amelyre rányomta bélyegét. Az íjászat művészete, mondhatni a zen
előiskolája, amely érthető ábrázolásban igyekszik átélhetővé tenni a
rejtett történéseket. Annak a csaknem hat évig tartó oktatásnak a
menetéről szeretnék beszámolni, amelyben Japánban való
tartózkodásom idején az íjászat egyik elismert mesternél
részesültem. Erre a vállalkozásra saját tapasztalataim jogosítanak föl.
Ahhoz azonban, hogy megértsenek, az szükséges, hogy részletesen
leírjak minden akadályt melyet le kellett küzdenem, minden gátlást
amelytől meg kellett szabadulnom, hogy a Nagy Tan szellemébe
behatolhassak. Tudatosan mondok le magának az oktatás keretének
ábrázolásáról, az emlékezetemben megtapadt jelenetek
fölidézéséről, és mindenekelőtt arról - bármily csábító is a lehetőség
- hogy képet adjak mesteremről. Legyen csak az íjazás művészetéről
szó - bár néha ügy tűnik - ezt nehezebb leírni, mint elsajátítani.
Mégis ama pontig kívánom folytatni az ismertetést, ahonnan már
látható a horizont, amely mögött a zen lélegzik.
HOGY MIÉRT kezdtem zennel foglalkozni, miért határoztam el, hogy
éppen az íjászat művészetét sajátítom el e célból, magyarázatra
szorul. Már mint diák behatóan foglalkoztam misztikával, noha a kor
hangulata ezt nem indokolta. De fáradásaim ellenére azt kellett
megállapítanom, hogy a misztikus szövegeket csak fölszínesen
vagyok képes megközelíteni. A misztika széleskörű irodalmában
éppen azt nem találtam meg amit kerestem. Csalódottan és
elbátortalanodva jutottam arra a belátásra, hogy csak az, aki valóban
„elszakadt", értheti az „elszakadás" kifejezést; hogy csak a
fölszabadultan meditáló képes az „istenivel egyesülni". Beláttam,
hogy a misztika a személyes tapasztalás útja, és ha az előföltételek
hiányoznak, minden magyarázat csak szócséplés, de hogyan válik



valaki misztikussá? Hogyan kerül a valódi és nem csak képzelt
elmélyedés állapotába? Van-e erre lehetősége annak is, akit a nagy
mesterektől évszázadok szakadéka választ el? Kérdéseimre sehol
sem találtam kielégítő választ. Bárhogy is kezdtem tehát a misztika
tanulmányozásához, mindig zárt ajtók előtt találtam magamat, de
mégsem mondtam le arról hogy megnyissam azokat.
Így mikor - már mint magántanár - azt az ajánlatot kaptam, hogy
filozófiát tanítsak a Császári Tohoku Egyetemen, örömmel
üdvözöltem a lehetőséget. Örültem, hogy megismerhetem Japánt és
népét, mert ily módon remélhettem, hogy kapcsolatba kerülök a
buddhizmussal, a meditációs gyakorlatokkal. Azt már tudtam, hogy
Japánban gondosan ápolják a hagyományokat, a zen szellemét, és
ami számomra legfontosabb, hivatott mesterek bámulatos
tapasztalatokkal rendelkeznek a „vezetés" művészetében.
Alig illeszkedtem bele az új környezetbe, máris vágyam
megvalósításával kezdtem foglalkozni; bár eleinte ellenállásba
ütköztem. Európai még soha nem foglalkozott komolyan zennel - volt
a kifogás - és amit „elméletileg" közvetíthetnének az nem vezetne
célhoz. Nyugatiak számára lehetetlen behatolni az ázsiai szellem e
legzártabb területére, hacsak nem a japán művészetek egyikének
tanulásával kezdi, amely kapcsolatban áll a zennel.
Az előiskolázás gondolata nem ijesztett el, és kész voltam bármibe
beleegyezni abban a reményben, hogy közelebb jutok a zen
megértéséhez. De melyik utat válasszam? Feleségem habozás nélkül
a virágkötés és tus-festés művelését választotta, magam pedig az
íjászat mellett döntöttem.
A későbbiekben megállapítottam, hogy téves föltételezésből
indultam ki amikor azt hittem, hogy a céllövészetben való
jártasságomat fölhasználhatom.
Kollégámat, Sozo Komachiyát, aki két évtizede gyakorolta az
íjászatot, kértem meg, hogy ajánljon be tanítványként Kenzô Awa
mesterhez. A mester először elutasított, kijelentvén, hogy volt már



nyugati tanítványa, de kedvezőtlenek tapasztalatai. Csak miután
sikerült meggyőznöm, hogy az íjászat művészetét a Nagy Tan
megismerése céljából kívánom elsajátítani, fogadott el engem és
egyben feleségemet tanítványul.
Így vette kezdetét a szigorú oktatás, amelynél tolmácsként
Komachiya úr is segédkezett, aki nem csak pártfogolt minket, de
mondhatni kezeskedett értünk.
A MESTER először japán íjakat mutatott be és formájuk, és a
készítésükhöz leginkább használt anyaguk, a bambusz
tulajdonságának ismertetése alapján elmagyarázta miben rejlik kiváló
feszítőerejük. Fölhívta figyelmünket a közel két méteres íj rendkívül
nemes formájára, melyet akkor vesz föl, ha már használathoz feszül.
Ha annyira kihúzzuk, amennyire lehetséges, az íj a „mindenséget"
zárja magába - fűzte hozzá magyarázatként. Ezért fontos, hogy
elsajátítsuk a megfeszítés helyes módját. Ezután megragadta íjai
közül a legerősebbet, és a már megfeszített húrt hangsúlyozottan
ünnepélyes tartásban eleresztette. Hang keletkezett: erős ütés és
zúgás keveréke; olyan amelyet senki nem felejt el, ha már
néhányszor hallotta: E hangnak ősidők óta gonosz szellemeket
leigázó titkos hatalmat tulajdonítanak. A beavatásnak3/ és
megtisztulásnak e jelentős aktusa után a mester fölszólított,
figyeljem meg pontosan, ami következik. Nyilat helyezett a húrra,
melyet végsőkig megfeszített, majd a lövés következett. A folyamat
szépsége és könnyedsége nagy hatást tett rám. Ezután elhangzott
az utasítás: "Csinálja utánam, de vegye figyelembe hogy az íjazás
nem az izmok erősítését szolgálja. A húr megfeszítésekor nem a test
erejét kell igénybe venni, a munkát lehetőleg csak a kezek végezzék.
A kar és váll izmai lazák maradnak. Ennek elsajátítása előföltétele
annak, hogy az íj megfeszítése és a lövés ʼszellemivéʼ váljék."
Már az első kísérletnél éreztem - pedig az íj csak közepes erősségű
gyakorló szerszám volt - hogy nagy testi erőt kell kifejtenem a húr



megfeszítéséhez. Nehézséget okozott az is, hogy a japán íjat nem
vállmagasságban tartják, mint az európai sportíjat, hanem szinte
teljesen nyújtott karral úgy emelik föl, hogy a kezek a fej fölé
kerülnek. Egyenletesen kell feszíteni, és minél távolabb kerül
egymástól íj és húr, annál mélyebbre kerülnek a kezek is, míg végre
az íjat tartó bal kéz a kinyújtott bal karral a szem magasságában, a
húrt feszítő jobb kéz, a behajlított jobb karral, a jobboldali váll fölött
meg nem állapodik. A fesztáv így akkora lesz, hogy a csaknem
méteres nyíl csak kevéssé ér túl az íj peremén. Az íjász e tartásban
időzik megfelelő ideig és csak azután oldja ki a lövést.
A megfeszítés és tartás szokatlan módja miatt kifejtett erőfeszítéstől
már néhány másodperc után reszketni kezdtek kezeim és lélegzetem
is elnehezült.
A helyzet a következő hetekben sem változott. Az íj megfeszítése
továbbra is nehezemre esett, és hiába gyakoroltam szorgalmasan, a
dolog csak nem akart „szellemivé” válni. Azzal vigasztaltam magam,
hogy biztosan valami fogáson múlik, amit a mester valamely okból
titokban tart, talán hogy magam jöjjek rá a dolog nyitjára.
A mester figyelemmel kísérte fáradozásaimat, javította kényszeredett
testtartásomat, dicsérte szorgalmam, kifogásolta túlzott
erőkifejtésemet, de semmi „alapvetőt” nem mondott. Elérkezett
azonban a nap, amikor elfogyott a türelmem és eljutottam odáig,
hogy kijelentsem: az előírt módon képtelen vagyok megfeszíteni az
íjat.
- Nem tudja - világosított föl a mester - mert rosszul lélegzik. Lassú
belégzés után óvatosan szorítsa lefelé a levegőt míg kissé megfeszül
a rekeszizom. Ezután egyenletesen és lassan fújja ki a levegőt, majd
rövid szünet után gyors lélegzetvétel következzék. Ezt folyamatosan
gyakorolva a légzés önmagától válik majd ritmusossá. A helyes
légzés nyomán napról napra könnyebb lesz az íj megfeszítése. E
légzési módszerrel rálel a szellemi erő forrására. És minél lazább lesz
tartása, tagjai annál könnyebben telnek meg vele.



Hogy bizonyítsa igazát, megfeszítette erős íját és fölszólított, mögéje
lépve tapogassam meg karizmait. Valóban oly lazák voltak, mintha
nem végeztek volna munkát.
A légzés e módját először íj és nyíl nélkül gyakoroltuk. Kezdeti
elfogódottságomat hamar sikerült leküzdenem. A lassú, de
folyamatos és fokozatosan kifogyó légzésre a mester oly nagy súlyt
helyezett, hogy gyakorlását zümmögő hanghoz kapcsoltatta. Csak
akkor szívhattam be újra levegőt, amikor a kilégzéskor elhalt a hang
is.
- A belégzés - mondta a mester - köt és összekapcsol; a levegő
visszatartásakor bontakozik ki a lényeg; a kilégzés old és beteljesít,
amennyiben leküzdi az akadályokat.
Szavait akkor még nem értettem.
Ezután következett a légzés összekapcsolása az íjászattal. A
húrfeszítés és kioldás egységes menetét az alábbi folyamatokra
kellett bontani: az íj megragadása - a nyíl fölhelyezése – az íj
fölemelése - húrfeszítés és megmaradás a legnagyobb feszítettség
állapotában - a lövés kioldása. Mindegyik rész folyamatot belégzés
vezetett be, a leszorított levegő visszatartása tartott egyensúlyban,
és a kilégzés fejezett be. A tevékenységbe szinte magától
kapcsolódott bele a légzés és nemcsak az egyes helyzeteknek adott
jelentőséget, de össze is kapcsolta azokat ritmikus tagozódásukban.
A folyamat a részekre bontás ellenére is egységes történésként
hatott, mely önmagából és önmagában létezik, és semmiképpen
nem hasonlítható oly tornagyakorlathoz, melyhez/melyből tetszés
szerint toldhatók/vehetők el részek, anélkül hogy jellege elveszne.
Visszaemlékezve eszembe jut, mily nehezemre esett kezdetben,
hogy a lélegzést hatni engedjem a folyamatra. Bár helyesen
lélegeztem, ügyeltem hogy feszítéskor kar és vállizmaim lazák
maradjanak, de önkénytelenül annál hevesebben feszítettem meg
lábizmaimat. A mester ilyenkor nem tehetett egyebet, mint
villámgyorsan odanyúlt és egyik vagy másik lábizmomat, különösen



érzékeny ponton megszorította. Mikor egy ilyen alkalommal
mentségemre - megjegyeztem, hiába fáradozom izmaim lazításán,
így felelt: A baj éppen az, hogy fáradozik, hogy gondol rá. Csupán a
lélegzésre koncentráljon, más föladata nincsen.
De eltartott még egy ideig, míg teljesíteni tudtam a mester
parancsát. De végül sikerült. Megtanultam „beléveszni” a
lélegzésbe, és néha úgy éreztem, nem én lélegzem, hanem „valami
engem lélegez”. Az idő folyamán egyre gyakrabban sikerült ellazított
testtel megfeszítenem és a kioldásig feszítésben tartani az íjat,
anélkül hogy tudtam volna hogyan viszem ezt végbe. A minőségi
különbség a sikertelen és sikeres kísérlet között azonban oly
meggyőző volt, hogy végre megértettem mit jelent az íj „szellemi”
megfeszítése. Egyszer Komachiya urat megkérdeztem, miért nézte
oly sokáig a mester tétlenül fáradozásomat, miért nem biztatott már
kezdetben a helyes légzés gyakorlására?
- A nagy mester - felelte - egyben nagy tanító is; ez nálunk magától
értetődő dolog. Ha a tanítást légzési gyakorlatokkal kezdte volna,
soha nem győzhette volna meg arról, hogy döntő szerepe van a
helyes légzésnek. Magam tapasztaltam, hogy a mester tanítványait
jobban ismeri, mint azok önmagukat.
A helyes megfeszítés után a lövés helyes kioldása következett. Eddig
úgy csináltuk, ahogy tudtuk; a lövés mintegy a gyakorlatok
függelékeként, zárójelben szerepelt. És hogy hová száll a nyíl, azzal
egyáltalán nem foglalkoztunk. Ha belefúródott a préselt
szalmahengerbe, céltáblánkba, már eleget tettünk a
követelménynek. A hengert pedig nem volt nehéz eltalálni - két
méternyi lehetett a távolság.
Ez idáig az íj húrját egyszerűen elengedtem, ha a feszítés kitartása
elviselhetetlenné vált, ha úgy éreztem engednem kell, ha széthúzott
kezeim egymás felé törekedtek. A feszítés különben nem okozott
fájdalmat; kipárnázott ujjú bőrkesztyű védte a kezet, nehogy a húr
tartós nyomása terhessé váljék. Feszítéskor hüvelykujjunkkal



átfogtuk a húrt és ujjunkat behajlítottuk. A mutató-, a középső és a
gyűrűsujj a hüvelyket kulcsolta át szorosan; ily módon a nyíl biztos
tartást nyert. A lövés kioldása tehát azt jelentette, hogy a hüvelyket
átfogó ujjak kinyílnak, a hüvelyket a húr erőteljes rántása kiragadja
helyzetéből és kinyújtja; a húr zúgni kezd és a nyíl kipattan. Eleinte a
leirt folyamat soha nem ment végbe anélkül, hogy ne rázkódtatta
volna meg íj és nyíllal együtt az egész testet. Magától értetődik, hogy
biztos lövés így nem sikerülhetett.
- Mindaz amit idáig tanult - mondta egy napon a mester - csak a
kioldásra való fölkészülés volt. Most nehéz föladat, az íjazás
következő fokozatának elsajátítása következik.
A mester megragadta íját, megfeszítette a húrt és kioldotta a lövést.
Most már nem kerülte el figyelmemet, hogy a mester jobbja,
miután kinyílt és mentesült a feszültségtől, legkevésbé sem
rázkódtatta meg testét. Az elkerülhetetlen lökést rugalmasan fogta
fel, egyenlítette ki.
Ha a kilövés erőteljességét nem bizonyította volna a húr erős,
ütődése és a nyíl átütő ereje, senki nem képzelt volna tetemes
erőkifejtést a folyamat mögött. A mesternél oly egyszerűen és
könnyeden hatott a lövés kioldása, mintha játszanék.
Az ázsiai szemében fölemelő látvány, ha erőteljes munkát igénylő
történésben nem vehető észre az erőkifejtés fáradsága. Számomra
azonban - és azon a fokon ahol akkor álltam nem is lehetett másképp
- sokkal fontosabbnak tűnt az a körülmény, hogy a találat biztonsága
a lövés lágy kioldásától függ. Minden amit eddig tanultam e
szempontból vált előttem érthetővé: feszítéskor laza testtartás,
ennek fönntartása a legnagyobb feszítés állapotában, a húr
lökésének rugalmas kiegyenlítése - vajon nem a találat biztonságát
szolgálja-e? Miért mondja a mester, hogy ezután olyasmi következik,
ami minden eddig tanultat felülmúl?
Gyakran úgy éreztem, mintha régebben, amikor minden
szándékosság nélkül lőttem ki a nyilat, jobban lőttem volna. Először



arra figyeltem föl, hogy a jobb kéz nyitása, különösen a hüvelykre
préselt ujjaké, nem ment megerőltetés nélkül. Ennek
következményeként a lövés lökése megrezegtette a nyilat. Arra pedig
egyáltalán nem voltam képes, hogy a hirtelen, fölszabadult kéz
lökését rugalmasan kiegyenlítsem. A mester fáradhatatlanul mutatta
be a hibátlan kioldást, én pedig szakadatlanul próbálkoztam őt
utánozni, de mindhiába. Úgy éreztem magam mint a százlábú, mely
mióta azon töri a fejét, mily sorrendbe rakja lábait, képtelen járni.
A mestert, mintha nem lepte volna meg sikertelenségem;
tapasztalatból tudta-e, hogy így fog történni?
- Ne gondoljon arra, hogy mit kell tennie - mondta - és azt se
fontolgassa, hogyan csinálja! A lövés csak akkor igazán jó, ha magát
az íjászt is meglepi az eredmény. Mintha a, húr hirtelen átvágná a
hüvelyket, ne szándékosan nyissa ki jobbját!
A terméketlen gyakorlás hetei, hónapjai következtek. A mester lövése
újra és újra elém állította a mércét, de azt elérnem nem sikerült.
Véletlenül, vagy a mester szándéka szerint - egy napon egy csésze
tea mellett találkoztunk. Megragadtam az alkalmat és kiöntöttem a
szívem.
- Bár értem, hogy nem szabad szándékoltan nyitni a kezem, de
képtelen vagyok ezt teljesíteni. Ha szorosan tartom a kezem, nem
kerülhetem el a rázkódást, ha laza a tartás, idő előtt pattan a húr. E
két véglet között nem találom meg a középutat.
- A megfeszített húrt úgy kell tartania - felelte a mester – ahogy a
gyermek fogja át a felnőtt ujját. Oly szoros a fogása, hogy csodáljuk
parányi ökle erejét. És ha kienged szorításából, nem érzünk
rázkódást. Tudja, miért történik így? A gyermek nem gondolja meg
előre, hogy elengedi az ujjunkat, hogy megragadjon másvalamit,
hanem megfontolás és szándék nélkül fordul egyik dologtól a másik
felé. Azt mondhatnánk, hogy játszik a dolgokkal, de mondhatjuk azt
is, hogy a dolgok játszanak vele.
- Értem mester - jegyeztem meg - amit hasonlatával mondani akar,



de nem más-e az én helyzetem? Miközben megfeszítve tartom az
íjat, elérkezik egy pillanat amikor érzem: ha nem oldok ki azonnal,
nem bírom tovább a feszítést. Kifulladok - nekem kell tehát
kioldanom a lövést, bárhogy is sikerül.
- A hiba önnél az - állapította meg mesterem - hogy nem tud
szabadulni önmagától. Ön nem a sikerre, hanem a kudarcra készül
föl.
Amíg ez nem változik, kénytelen a személyétől történést önmaga
előidézni. Addig nem nyílnak úgy ki kezei, mint-a gyermeké, mint a
megérett gyümölcs fölpattanó héja.
Bevallom, ez az értelmezés még jobban megzavart, mert végül is
nem én feszítem-e meg az íjat? Nem én oldom ki a lövést, hogy
célba találjak? A megfeszítés a célba találás előföltétele. A gyermek
ily összefüggésekkel nincs tisztában, én viszont képtelen vagyok
arról megfeledkezni.
- Az igazi művészet - szólt a mester - nem célratörő, hanem
szándékot nélkülöző. Minél makacsabbul ragaszkodik ahhoz, hogy a
cél biztos eltalálása kedvéért tanulja meg a nyíl helyes kilövését,
annál kevésbé számíthat sikerre. A legjobban az gátolna, hogy
nagyon akar akarni. Hogy azt hiszi, amit nem maga végez, az meg
sem történhetik.
- Mester ön maga mondta - vetettem közbe - hogy az íjászat nem
céltalan játék, de élet-halál kérdése.
Ezt állom is - felelte - mi íjászmesterek azt tartjuk, hogy ahány lövés:
annyi élet! Hogy ez mit jelent, most még nem értheti meg, de egy
másik hasonlat, amely ugyanezen tapasztalatot fedi, talán segít
önnek. Az íjászmesterek azt mondják, hogy az íj fölső vége átdöfi az
égboltot, az alsón pedig selyemszálon a föld függ. Aki a lövést erős
rázkódással oldja ki, elszakíthatja a vékony szálat. Annál aki
szándékoltan erőszakos, végzetessé válhat a szakadás, és ő maga
pedig örökké függve marad ég és föld között.
- Mit tehetnék?



- Tanuljon meg várni!
- Ennek mi a módja?
- Szakítani önmagával és mindazzal amit sajátjának tart.
- Szándéktalanul váljak tehát szándéktalanná?
- Nem tudom, mi lenne erre a megfelelő válasz, mert ilyen kérdéssel
még nem találkoztam.
- És mikor kezdjük el az új gyakorlatokat?
- Várnia kell, míg eljön az ideje.
ELISMEREM, hogy ez, a tanítás kezdete óta első részletesebb
beszélgetésünk nagyon megdöbbentett. Végre érintettük azt a
témát, amelynek kedvéért elhatároztam, hogy elsajátítom az íjászat
művészetét. Vajon ez az önmagunktól való elszakadás, amelyről a
mester beszélt, nem az elvonultsághoz vezető út? Nem érkeztem-e
el arra a pontra, amelyen a zen befolyása érezhetően kezd hatni az íj
kezelésére? Hogy milyen összefüggésben állhat a szándékolatlan
várni tudás a lövés helyes, éppen a kellő pillanatban bekövetkező
kioldásával, amikor a feszültség beteljesedett - ezt persze egyenlőre
nem tudtam eldönteni. De miért fussak előre gondolatban valami
felé, amire csak a tapasztalat taníthat meg? Talán itt az ideje, hogy
fölhagyjak a terméketlen fontolgatással. Irigyeltem a mester több
tanítványát, akik gyermekként hagyták vezetni magukat. Mily
boldogít is lehet a föltétlen bizalom! De ez a magatartás nem
vezethet közömbösségre, szellemi bénaságra; hiszen a gyermeknek
is megengedik, hogy kérdezősködjék.
A legközelebbi tanítási napon a mester - csalódásomra – tovább
folytatta az íj megfeszítését, a legnagyobb feszültség állapotában
való megmaradás, és a lövés helyes kioldását célzó gyakorlatokat.
Türelme, jóságos szavai azonban nem használtak. Bár
megkíséreltem, hogy útmutatásainak megfelelően, ne csökkentsem
a feszítés erejét, sőt növeljem azt, mintha nem szabna határt maga
az íj minősége; bár igyekeztem várni amíg a feszültség „beteljesül”



és önmagától oldódik ki a lövés; fáradozásaimat siker nem koronázta.
- Ha legközelebb fölkeresnek - figyelmeztetett a mester - már
útközben összpontosítsák gondolataikat. Állítsák be magukat arra,
ami majd itt történik. Az ide vezető úton haladjanak el minden
mellett, anélkül hogy figyelembe vennék - mintha a világon csak
egyetlen dolog volna fontos: az íjászat.
Az önmagunktól való elszakadás útját is fejezetekre osztotta a
mester, és a részföladatok gondos gyakorlását megkövetelte. Ám
tanításkor ismét csak rövid utalásokkal kellett beérnünk. Hiszen - így
vélekedett - e gyakorlatok kiviteléhez elég, ha a gyakorló megérti,
sőt esetenként csak sejti, hogy mit kívánnak tőle. Szükségtelen a
hagyományos, képszerű megkülönböztetéseket részletesen
megfogalmazni. Az első lépést megtettük az úton: a fizikai ellazítás
sikerült, amely nélkül nem sikerülhet az íj helyes megfeszítése. Hogy
azonban a helyes kioldás is megvalósulhasson, a testi ellazítottságot
szellemi ellazítottságba kellett átvezetni. A szellemet nem csupán
mozgékonnyá, de szabaddá is kellett tenni; mozgékonnyá a
szabadság érdekében, és szabaddá a mozgékonyság érdekében.
Ama követelménynek, hogy az érzékek kapuit bezárhassuk, nem
elfordulással, hanem ellenállástól mentes kitéréssel tehetünk eleget.
Hogy azonban ez a nem-cselekvés ösztönösen sikerüljön, a léleknek
belső tartásra van szüksége, és ezt úgy szerezheti meg, ha a
légzésre koncentrál. A légzés tudatosan, szinte pedáns
lelkiismeretességgel történik. Minél bensőségesebben koncentrálunk
a légzésre, annál közömbösekké válnak a külső ingerek. A
gyakorlatok folyamán az erős behatásokkal szemben is immunissá
válunk, és egyre könnyebben függetleníthetjük magunkat azoktól.
Csak arra kell ügyelnünk, hogy testünk, állás, ülés vagy fekvés
közben lazított legyen, és ha ily állapotban koncentrálunk a légzésre,
nemsokára úgy érezzük, mintha burok szigetelne el a külvilágtól.
Lelkiismeretes gyakorlás következtében szinte önmagától jut el a
tudat az „önmagában-időzés” állapotába, ami egyébként csak a ritka



álmokban tapasztalható rendkívüli könnyűség és boldogító biztonság
ama érzésében hatványozódik, hogy minden irányba fölkelthetünk
energiát, valamint a szükséghez képest fokozatosan növelhetünk és
oldhatunk feszültségeket.
Ezt az állapotot, amelyben már nem gondolkodunk, nem tervezünk,
nem kívánunk, nem várunk semmit, amelyben a tudat nem fordul
semmilyen irányba, de az erő teljességéből képesnek érzi magát
minden lehetségesre és lehetetlenre - ezt az állapotot, amely
gyökerében szándékot nélkülöző, nevezi a mester „szelleminek”. A
szellem mondja a tétel - mindenütt jelenvaló, mert sehol meg nem
tapad.
A megkívánt elszakadást, önfelszabadítást, az élet bensőségessé
tételét és a teljes lélekjelenlétbe sűrítést Japánban nem bízzák jó
adottságokra vagy véletlenre. Arra sem építik az átalakításnak ezt a
minden energiát igénybe vevő folyamatát, hogy a koncentráció majd
„magától” következik be. Ellenkezőleg: minden tevékenység és
teljesítmény, minden önátadás és beilleszkedés előtt „létrehozzák”
ezt a szellemi állapotot, amelyet azután összekapcsolnak az íjazás
művészetével. Az íjazás ily módon válik a Nagy Tan szertartásává. A
tanítvány megérti, miért nem nevezhető sportnak,
tornagyakorlatnak, amit elsajátítani igyekszik. Megérti, hogy a
technikailag megtanulhatót miért kell fáradhatatlanul gyakorolnia.
Ha minden attól függ, hogy teljesen önfeledten, minden
szándékoltság nélkül illeszkedjünk bele a történésbe, a
véghezvitelnek szinte önmagától kell lejátszódni, irányítás, ellenőrző
megfontolás szóba sem jöhet. A japán oktatás valójában a formáknak
e föltétel nélküli uralmára irányul. Jellemzői a folyamatosan fokozott
begyakorlás, az ismétlés, és az ismétlések ismétlése. Ez áll
legalábbis minden hagyományhoz kötött - művészetre. Bemutatás,
kialakítás; beleérzés, utánzás - ez a tanítás alapvető menete, bárha
ma már európai tanítási módszerek is megvetették lábukat
Japánban.



A japán tanítvány három dolgot hoz magával: jó nevelését, az általa
választott művészet iránti szenvedélyes szeretetet és a mester
föltétel nélküli tiszteletét. A mester-tanítvány viszony ősidők óta az
élet alapvető része, és magában foglalja a mester nagy
felelősségtudatát is, messze az oktatás tárgyának keretein túl.
A tanítványtól kezdetben nem kívánnak mást, mint hogy utánozza a
mester által bemutatottakat. Nincsen hosszú lélegzetű magyarázat
és megokolás; a tanítás csak rövid utasításokra szorítkozik, és nem
számol a tanítvány kérdéseivel. A mester higgadtan szemléli a
tanítvány tapogatózó fáradozását, nem épít önállóságra, vállalkozó
kedvre, és türelmesen várja a növekedés és érés kibontakozását.
Tehát a mester nem sürget, a tanítvány nem siet - ideje van
mindkettejüknek.
A mesternek nincs szándékában, hogy tanítványában idő előtt
fölébressze a művész ambícióit; első föladatának azt tartja , hogy jó
szakember váljék belőle. A tanítvány pedig fáradhatatlanul támogatja
ezt a törekvést; mintha nem is volnának magasabb igényei.
Megadással viseli el a megterheléseket, hogy aztán évek multán azt
tapasztalja, hogy a tökéletesen elsajátított formák nem nyomasztják
többé, hanem fölszabadítják. Az ecsetet vezető kéz például, szinte
ugyanabban a pillanatban, melyben szelleme megkezdte alakító
tevékenységét, már el is találta, véghez is vitte azt, ami előtte
lebegett. A tanítvány végül nem is tudja hogy a mű sikerét
szellemének vagy kezének köszönheti-e.
Míg azonban eljut odáig, hogy tudása „szellemivé” válik, minden testi
és lelki erejére egyaránt szüksége van.
A tus és ecset mestere helyet foglal tanítványai előtt. Megvizsgálja,
megfontoltan előkészíti ecsetét, gondosan dörzsölve a tusrudat,
alkalmassá téve azt a használatra, megigazítja az előtte fekvő
hosszú, keskeny papíroscsíkot, és végül hosszabb, mély
koncentrációban eltöltött idő után, gyors és biztos vonásokkal
munkához lát. A kép vagy írás egyetlen vonala sem javítható, de nem



is fordul elő hogy bármi is javításra szorulna.
A virágkötés mestere azzal kezdi a tanítást, hogy óvatosan kioldozza
és gondosan félreteszi a virágzó ágakat összetartó háncsot.
Megszemléli az egyes ágakat, majd kiválasztja a legmegfelelőbbeket.
Ezeknek óvatos hajlítgatással megadja a szerepüknek megfelelő
formát és ezután valamennyit az erre a célra kikészített edénybe
vagy vázába helyezi. Az összeállított csokor ekkor már oly hatást
kelt, mintha a mester eltalálta volna mindazt amit a természet
megkívánt.
A mesterek mindenkor úgy viselkednek mintha egyedül volnának.
Tanítványaikra alig pillantanak, még kevésbé társalognak velük.
Merengve, ráérősen végzik az előkészítő mozdulatokat, önfeledten
merülnek el az alakítás folyamatában.
Fölmerül a kérdés, hogy vajon miért nem végezteti el a mester a
szükséges, de mégis csak alárendelt előkészítő munkákat esetleg
egyik tapasztaltabb tanítványával? Vajon alakító ereje szárnyakat
kap-e, ha maga dörzsöli a tust, ha a háncsot ahelyett hogy átvágná
és egyszerűen elhajítaná, oly körülményesen bontja ki? És mi készteti
arra, hogy minden tanítás alkalmával pontosan ismételje meg minden
eltérés nélkül ugyanazt a folyamatot?
A mester jól tudja, hogy annak az elmélyedő nyugalomnak, mellyel az
előkészületeket végzi, köszönheti azt a döntő ellazítottságot és
alkotóerejének ama kiegyensúlyozottságát, azt a koncentráltságot és
lélekjelenlétet, amelyek nélkül nem jöhet létre igazi műalkotás. Ez a
szándéktalan átélés vezeti el ama pillanathoz, amikor az ideális
vonalakban előtte lebegő cél szinte önmagától valósul meg. Amint az
íjazásnál a mozzanatoknak és helyzeteknek – ez esetben más
formában és más előjátékokkal - ugyanez az értelme.
Amint a leírtakból nyilvánvaló, minden esetben félreismerhetetlenül
szertartásokról van szó. Így téteti meg a mester tanítványával az
önmagán keresztül vezető utat. A tanítvány pedig egyre
fogékonyabb lesz arra, hogy mestere segítségével napvilágra hozza



azt amiről ugyan sokszor hallott már, de aminek realitása csak most,
saját tapasztalatai nyomán kezd megfogható valósággá válni. És nem
fontos immár minek nevezi a mester azt, amire gondol és az sem
fontos, hogy egyáltalán megnevezi-e. Így indul meg a „belső
mozgás”, melyet a mester figyelemmel kísér. Nem szavakkal, hanem
szelleme közvetlen átvitelévei segíti e „mozgást”, hasonlóan ahhoz,
ahogyan „egy égő gyertya lángra lobbant egy másikat”. Szív szívnek
adja át a művészet szellemét, és a tanítvány ráébred arra, hogy
minden, még oly káprázatos külső műalkotásnál fontosabb,
elsődlegesebb a belső mű. A szó legátfogóbb értelmében a mester
személyében találkozik magasabb szinten az ember és a művészet.
A mesteri mivoltot, mint életformát az teszi hitelessé, hogy
határtalan igazság élteti. És mert a határtalan igazság hordozója,
nem is lehet más mint az őseredeti művészet maga. Az ember, a
művész és a műalkotás egységet alkot.
A mesterré válás útja meredek. A tanítványt gyakran már csak a
mesterbe vetett hit irányítja; a mester előtte valósítva meg benső
művét, létével győzi meg.
A mester utánzása így nyeri el utolsó és legértettebb értelmét:
követése nyomán válik alkotó szellemének részesévé. De hogy a
tanítvány meddig jut el, az már nem a tanító gondja. Tanítványát
amint megmutatta neki a helyes irányt - egyedül hagyja tovább
haladni. A végső amit megtehet, hogy igyekszik leválasztani
önmagáról, hogy magányában megtanuljon a maga lábán megállni.
Őszintén arra biztatja, hogy tegyen túl mesterén, „nőjön a fejére".
A tanítvány pedig, bár elveszítheti szeme elől mesterét, de elfelejteni
soha nem fogja. Reá emlékezve minden áldozatra kész hálát fog
érezni.
AZ ÍJÁSZATNAK a Nagy Tan szertartásába emelt értelmezésébe
napról napra könnyebben illeszkedtem be, és fáradságot, sem
éreztem a gyakorlatok végzése közben. Pontosabban kifejezve, úgy



éreztem mintha félálomban történne minden. Ennyiben igazolódott,
amit mesterem előre jelzett.
Mégsem tudtam meggátolni, hogy a folyamatos koncentráltság csak
addig a pillanatig tartson, amelyben a lövés kioldása bekövetkezik. A
várakozás a legmagasabb feszültség állapotában nemcsak veszített
intenzitásából, de oly elviselhetetlenné vált, hogy mindig újra
kiragadott az elmélyedésből és figyelmem a lövés tényére irányult.
- Ne gondoljon a lövésre - figyelmeztetett a mester - így nem
sikerülhet!
- Kénytelen vagyok - válaszoltam - már csaknem fájdalmat okoz a
feszültség!
- Csak amiatt érez így, mivel valójában még nem szakadt el
önmagától. Pedig milyen egyszerű a dolog. Tanuljon a bambusz
levelétől, melyet egyre jobban nyom a hó terhe. A hó egyszerre
lecsúszik róla, anélkül hogy a levél megrezzenne. Várakozzék
hasonló módon a legmagasabb feszültség állapotában, míg a lövés
önmagától oldódik ki. Hiszen ha a feszültség „beteljesedett” a
kioldás be kell következzék. Lehull az íjászról, mint a hó terhe a
bambusz leveléről.
De minden törekvésem ellenére sem sikerült a szándékomtól
független lövés. Nem maradt más hátra, minthogy tudatosan
szakítsam meg a feszítést a lövés pillanatában. És ez a sikertelenség
annál inkább elkeserített, mivel már harmadik éve gyakoroltam. Nem
tagadom, keserves órákat éltem át. Azt kérdeztem magamtól,
vállalhatom-e továbbra is felelősséggel az időpazarlást, amely
látszólag semmi kapcsolatban nem áll mindazzal, amit eddig
megtanultam és tapasztaltam.
Nyári vakációra a tengerpartra, egy csöndes és szép, magányos
helyre utaztunk. Legfontosabb csomagom íjam és nyilaim voltak.
Engem állandóan a lövés kioldása foglalkoztatott. Valóságos
rögeszmémmé vált és egyre inkább elfelejtettem mesterem
utasítását: semmi mást ne gyakoroljak, mint az elmélyedést.



Töprengve, latolgatva arra az eredményre jutottam, hogy a hiba talán
nem ott rejlik, ahol a mester gyanítja - a szándéktalanság és
önfeledtség hiányában - hanem abban, hogy jobbom ujjai a
hüvelyket túl szorosan fogják át. Mivel jobban késett a kioldás,
akaratlanul is annál görcsösebben szorítottam össze ujjaimat. Úgy
éreztem, itt kell a dolgok menetébe beleavatkoznom. Nemsokára
meg is találtam az egyszerű és világos megoldást. Ha - miután az íjat
megfeszítettem - óvatosan és fokozatosan nyújtottam a hüvelykre
szorított ujjat, elérkezett a pillanat, amikor a hüvelyk - miután a más
ujj nem tartotta többé - szinte kiszakadt helyzetéből. Így történt
meg, hogy a lövés villámszerűen oldódott ki, „úgy hullott le, mint a
bambusz leveléről a hó”.
Meggyőződésemmé vált, hogy a helyes úton járok. Ahogy
tapasztaltam, majdnem minden lövés simán, "észrevétlenül" sikerült.
Természetesen föl kellett figyelnem a dolog fonákjára is: teljes
figyelmemet igénybe vette a kéz pontos munkája. De azzal
vigasztaltam magam, hogy e technikát lassankint úgy begyakorlom,
hogy nem lesz különösebb figyelemre szükség. Tehát el kell jönnie a
napnak, amikor éppen e módszer segítségével kerülök abba a
helyzetbe, hogy önfeledten, a legnagyobb feszültség állapotában
kitartva, tudatosság nélkül oldjam ki a lövést; nevezetesen technikai
tudásom válik majd „szellemivé”. E hitemben bizakodva végül úgy
éreztem, hogy döntő lépéssel jutottam előbbre.
Visszatérésem után, mindjárt az első tanítási napon, az volt az
érzésem hogy már az első lövésem sikerült. A mester figyelmesen
nézett rám, és mint aki nem egészen hisz a szemének, így szólt:
- Még egyszer, legyen szíves!
Második lövésem, még az elsőzőt is fölülmúlni látszott. A mester
azonban szó nélkül hozzám lépett, kivette az íjat a kezemből, és
háttal felém helyet foglalt vánkosán. Értettem, hogy ez mit jelent és
távoztam.
Egy nappal később Komachiya úr közölte velem, hogy mesterem



további tanításomra nem vállalkozik, mivel félre akartam vezetni.
Viselkedésem ily értelmezésétől megdöbbenve, megkíséreltem
Komachiya úrnak körvonalazni, miképpen és miért határoztam el
magam e módszer alkalmazására - megunván az egy helyben
topogást.
A mester végül - közbenjárására - visszafogadott, de azzal a
kikötéssel, hogy többé nem vétek a Nagy Tan szelleme ellen.
Ha megszégyenítésem nem gyógyított volna ki, kigyógyított a mester
magatartása. Egyetlen szóval sem említette a történteket, csupán
ennyit jegyzett meg:
- Ne kérdezze önmagától: „Képes leszek rá?” Várjon amíg
másképpen történik...
Már negyedik éve tanulok - vetettem ellen - és japáni tartózkodásom
sem korlátlan.
- A cél felé vezető út hosszát nem lehet kimérni - hangzott a válasz.
- Mit jelenthetnek hetek, hónapok, vagy évek?
- És ha félúton abba kellene hagynom...?
- Ha valóban sikerül levetnie személyisége korlátait, bármikor
megállhat. Ezt igyekezzék elérni.
És ismét elölről kezdtünk mindent, mintha mindaz amit eddig
tanultam, semmit sem ért volna. Ám a szándéktalan cselekvés, a
kitartás a legnagyobb feszültség állapotában csakúgy nem sikerült
mint ez idáig.
- De hogyan is oldódhat ki a lövés - kérdeztem egy napon
mesteremtől -, ha nem én cselekszem?
- „Az” oldja ki a lövést - hangzott a válasz.
- Ezt már hallottam néhányszor, de engedtessék meg a kérdés:
hogyan válhatok én személytelenné, ha éppen énemet kell
kikapcsolnom?
- „Az” időzik a legnagyobb feszültség állapotában!
- És ki vagy mi légyen „Az”? - kérdeztem.
- Ha ezt fölfogja, nem lesz rám többé szüksége. De ne beszéljünk



tovább a dologról, inkább folytassuk a gyakorlást.
És ismét hetek múltak el anélkül, hogy egyetlen lépéssel előbbre
jutottam volna. Ezzel szemben megállapítottam, hogy már a
sikertelenség sem érint, mintha belefáradtam volna az egészbe.
Hogy mit is ért a mester "Az" alatt, már nem is érdekelt.
Elhatároztam, hogy mindezt közlöm mesteremmel, de az utolsó
pillanatban nem volt hozzá bátorságom. Tudtam, hogy újra csak ez
volna a válasz: ne vitatkozzék, hanem gyakoroljon.
Így hát nem kérdezősködtem, és talán a gyakorlást is abbahagytam
volna, ha mesterem nem tart erősen kézben. Éltem egyik napról a
másikra, jól-rosszul elláttam munkámat, és azt sem vettem már
szívemre, hogy azzal szemben váltam közömbössé, ami után éveken
keresztül áhítoztam.
Egy napon azonban a mester a lövés kioldása után meghajlással
üdvözölt és megszakította a tanítást. "Az" lőtt - kiáltotta. Értetlenül
bámultam rá, de örömömet alig tudtam palástolni.
- Amit mondtam nem dicséret volt csak megállapítás. Nem ön előtt
hajoltam meg, mert a lövés nem az ön műve volt. Ezúttal önfeledten,
szándéktalanul tartott ki a legnagyobb feszültség állapotában, ezért
„hullott” le a lövés úgy, mint érett gyümölcs az ágról. Folytassa a
gyakorlást mintha mi sem történt volna.
Csak hosszabb idő múlva sikerült egy-egy lövésem kifogástalanul.
Ilyenkor a mester szótlanul meghajolt. Hogy miképpen történt, hogy
ezek a lövések közreműködésem nélkül oldódtak ki, ezt nem tudtam
akkor sem, és ma sem tudnám megmagyarázni. Tény, hogy így
történt és csak ez a fontos. Lassankint azután magam is meg tudtam
különböztetni a jó lövéseket a sikertelenektől. A minőségi különbség
olyan nagy volt, hogy aki tapasztalta észre kellett vegye. Külsőleg az
jellemzi a lövést, hogy amikor a jobb kéz lökésszerű visszapattanása
feloldódik, a test nem rázkódik meg. A jó lövés után a légzés üteme
nem változik, a szív egyenletesen ver. Belsőleg a siker úgy hat a
lövészre, hogy úgy érzi, mintha napja csak akkor kezdődött volna. Az



az érzése, hogy legyőzhetetlen, hogy mindenre képes volna.
- A nehezén talán túljutottunk - szóltam mesteremhez, amikor egy
napon közölte, hogy új gyakorlatokra térünk át.
- Nálunk úgy vélik - válaszolta -, ha száz mérföldet kell futnod, a
kilencvenet tekintsd a felének. - Ezután céltáblára fogunk lőni.
Eddig faállványra helyezett szalmahenger szolgált célul, amely
hozzávetőleg két méterre állt előttünk. A céltábla viszont hatvan
méter távolságban homoktöltésen volt elhelyezve.
A mester bemutatta a célba lövést; két nyila feketébe talált. Ezután
fölszólított végezzük a szertartást, mint ez idáig, és anélkül, hogy
különösebb jelentőséget tulajdonítanánk a céltáblának, oldjuk ki a
lövést. Nyilaink azonban, bár a megadott irányba szálltak, de messze
elkerülték a célt; még a homoktöltést sem érték el, előtte fúródtak a
földbe.
- A nyíl azért nem repül messzire, mert szellemük sem szárnyal
távolra - mondta a mester. - Gondolják, hogy a cél a végtelenben
van. Nem a nyíl a döntő , hanem a „lélekjelenlét”. A szertartást úgy
végezzék, mint ahogyan az igazi művész táncol. A Nagy Tan nem
ismer olyan célt, amely „csak technikával” eltalálható. Ha megnevezi
a célt, azt „Buddhának” hívja.
Ezután mesterünk fölszólított, hogy lövés közben figyeljük szemeit.
Akárcsak „szertartás” közben, szinte zárva voltak. Nem volt olyan
benyomásunk, mintha célzott volna.
Engedelmesen gyakoroltunk és célzás nélkül oldottuk ki a lövést.
Végül egyáltalán nem törődtem azzal, hogy hová repülnek nyilaim.
Még az időnkint előforduló találatok sem okoztak különösebb
örömet, hiszen tudtam, hogy ez csak a véletlen műve. Tartósan
azonban nem elégített ki ez a „levegőbe" lövöldözés. Ismét
kísértésbe estem és töprengeni kezdtem. A mester úgy tett, mintha
nem venné észre zavaromat, míg egy napon be nem vallottam, hogy
nem lelem a helyem.
- Fölöslegesen tépelődik - vigasztalt -, verje ki a gondokat fejéből.



Íjászmesterré válhat úgy is, ha nem sikerül minden találata. A célba
találás csak külső próba, és a szándéktalanság, magáról való
megfeledkezés, elmerültség, vagy nevezze ahogy akarja,
bizonyítékai. A mesterré levésnek fokozatai vannak és csak az nem
tévesztheti el a külső célt, aki már elérte a legfelső fokozatot.
- Éppen ez az, amit nem vagyok képes fölfogni - válaszoltam. Úgy
hiszem, el tudom képzelni mit ért a belső cél alatt, amelyet el kell
találnom. De miként következhet be a külső cél eltalálása anélkül,
hogy a lövész célozna, és hogy a külső találatok azt igazolnák, ami
belsőleg történik?
- Hamis az elképzelése - felelte rövid gondolkodás után mesterem -,
ha azt képzeli, hogy ezeknek az összefüggéseknek megértése
továbbsegítheti. Itt olyan folyamatokról van szó amelyeket,
értelemmel nem lehet megközelíteni. Lássunk egy példát a
természetből: a pók „eltáncolja” hálóját, anélkül hogy tudná, hogy
léteznek legyek, amelyeket elfog azzal. Ilyenkor is „Az” táncol, és
belső és külső eggyé válik.
Bármennyire is elgondolkoztatott e hasonlat, valami mégis lázadozott
bennem.
- Nem képzelhető el - kérdeztem - hogy ön évtizedes gyakorlás után
íjat és nyilat megfeszítéskor szinte az alvajáró biztonságával
ösztönösen hozza oly helyzetbe, hogy tudatos célzás nélkül, találja
el, sőt el sem tévesztheti a célt?
A mester, aki terhes kérdezősködésem már megszokta, a fejét rázta.
- Nem akarom kétségbe vonni, hogy lehet valami abban amit mond.
Hiszen „szemben” állok a céllal, meg kell pillantanom. De nyilvánvaló,
hogy a megpillantás nem dönt el, nem magyaráz meg semmit, hiszen
„úgy” látom a célt, mintha nem is látnám.
- Akkor bekötött szemmel is találnia kellene - csúszott ki a számon.
A mester úgy nézett rám, hogy már azt hittem, megsértettem.
Kisvártatva azonban így válaszolt:
- Jöjjön el ma este!



Magával szemben, egy párnára ültetett, és anélkül hogy megszólalt
volna, teával kínált. Hosszabb ideig ültünk így, és csak a parázs fölött
fortyogó víz duruzsolása hallatszott. Végre fölemelkedett és intett,
hogy kövessem. A gyakorlóterem fényesen ki volt világítva. A mester
kötőtű vékonyságú moszkitógyertyát helyeztetett velem a céltábla
elé a homokba, a céltábla fölötti lámpa azonban sötét maradt. Oly
sötét volt, hogy a tábla körvonalait sem tudtam kivenni. A mester
„eltáncolta” a szertartást. Az első nyíl a sugárzó fényességből az
éjszakai sötétbe zúgott. A becsapódásból megítélhettem, hogy
eltalálta a céltáblát. És talált a második nyílvessző is. Amikor
fölgyújtottam a lámpát a céltábla állványán, legnagyobb
megdöbbenésemre fedeztem föl, hogy az első nyíl a tábla fekete
központjába talált, a második szétroncsolta az első peremét és
nyelét hosszan fölhasítva fúródott közvetlen mellette a célba. Nem
volt bátorságom a nyilakat megérinteni; a céltáblával együtt vittem a
mesterhez, aki megvizsgálta a találatokat.
- Az első lövés - szólt - nem volt semmi különös, mint ön mondaná,
hiszen a céltáblát évtizedek óta oly jól ismerem, hogy vaksötétben is
tudnom kell hol áll. De mi a véleménye a második találatról? Magam
csak annyit mondhatok, nem az én művem. „Az” lőtt és „Az” talált:
Hajoljunk meg a cél, a Buddha előtt.
Két nyilával a mester alighanem engem is eltalált. Mintha átalakított
volna ez az emlékezetes éjszaka. Nem zaklatott többet a kísértés,
hogy nyilaim sorsával törődjek. Az is megerősített új
beállítottságomban, hogy a mester soha nem a céltáblát figyelte
gyakorlás közben, hanem az íjászt tartotta szemmel. Mintha róla
olvasná le legbiztosabban a lövés sikerét. Kérdésemre ezt nem is
tagadta. Így vitte át, maga is mély koncentrációban, művészete
szellemét tanítványaira. Nem átallom legsajátabb, de sokáig
kétségbevont tapasztalásom alapján azt is igazolni, hogy a
„közvetlen átvitel” nem puszta szóbeszéd, hanem realitás. De a
kardvívó mesterektől sem lehet elvitatni ama meggyeződésüket,



hogy a végtelen gonddal és fáradsággal készített kard átveszi a
kardkovács szellemét, aki szintén kultikus szertartásként űzi
hivatását.
Egy napon a mester, amikor lövésem kioldódott, fölkiáltott:
- Ez az! Hajoljon meg.
A céltáblára pillantva, nem tudtam örömében osztozni; nyílvesszőm
csak a tábla peremét érintette.
- Valódi lövés volt - döntött mesterem -, így folytassa.
A következő időkben egyre többször találtak célba nyilaim, de még
sok volt a sikertelen lövés is. De ha a mester észrevette a
találatok fölötti elégedettségemet , nyomban igyekezett lehűteni.
- Mit képzel? Azt hogy a sikertelen lövések fölött ne bosszankodjék,
már megtanulta. De tanulja meg azt is, hogy ne örvendezzék, ha
célba talál.
- Érti-e már - kérdezte mesterem egy különösen jól sikerült lövésem
után - mit jelent, hogy „Az” lő és „Az” talál?
- Attól tartok - válaszoltam - hogy már semmit nem értek, még a
legkézenfekvőbb is zavarba ejt. Én vagyok-e aki megfeszíti az íjat,
vagy az íj emel a legnagyobb feszültség állapotába? Én találom-e el a
célt, vagy a cél talál el engem? „Az” a test szempontjából szellemi-e,
vagy a szellem szempontjából testi? Esetleg mind a kettő? Az íj, nyíl,
cél és én annyira egybefonódtunk, hogy már nem tudok semmit
különválasztani, de nem is kívánom ezt megtenni. Ha kezembe
veszem az íjat és lövök, minden világos, egyértelmű és szinte
nevetségesen egyszerű.
- Ne feledkezzék meg e pillanatról - szakított félbe a mester -, az íj
húrja most járta át szívét.
TÖBB MINT ÖT év telt el tanulással, amikor mesterünk elhatározta,
hogy vizsgára bocsájt minket.
- Nem csupán tudásukról kell számot adniuk - mondta - ennél sokkal
többre becsüljük az íjász szellemi magatartását. Elvárom



tanítványimtól, hogy nem befolyásolja őket nézők jelenléte, de úgy
végzik majd a szertartást, mintha magunk között volnánk.
Az elkövetkező hetekben azonban a vizsgáról nem esett szó, és a
tanítás gyakran néhány lövés után abbamaradt. Azt a föladatot
kaptuk, hogy magányban végezzük el a szertartás minden
mozzanatát, főként azonban a helyes légzést gyakoroljuk.
Az otthonainkban végzett gyakorlatok hatására azután a közös
gyakorló órákon is könnyen valósítottuk meg a „lélekjelenlét”
állapotát. Oly biztonságban éreztük magunkat, hogy a nyilvános
vizsgának is nyugodtan néztünk elébe.
A vizsga pedig oly jól sikerült, hogy mesterünknek nem kellett
szégyenkeznie. Kézhez vettük a helyszínen elkészített diplomákat, a
fokozat föltüntetésével, amelyet kiérdemeltünk. A vizsgát mesterünk
két lövés leadásával zárta le.
Ettől kezdve a foglalkozások új jelleget nyertek. A mester
megelégedett néhány gyakorló lövéssel, és ezután rátért az íjászat
és a Nagy Tan összefüggéseinek magyarázatára. Noha rendszerint
hasonlatokba öltöztette mondanivalóját, immár értettük amit velünk
közölni kívánt.
- Aki képes „a nyúl szarva és a teknőc haja" segítségével (tehát íj és
nyíl nélkül) eltalálni a „központot”, méltán a művészet nélküli
művészet mestere. Így válik az íjászat mozgás nélküli mozgássá, így
valósul meg a zen.
Kérdésemre, hogy hazámba visszatérve, miként haladhatok tanítóm
nélkül tovább, így válaszolt:
- Amikor vizsgára bocsájtottam, már feleltem kérdésére. Elérte ama
fokozatot, amikor mester és tanítvány eggyé váltak. Ha továbbra is
úgy végzi gyakorlatait, ahogyan tanulta, bár tenger választja el tőlem,
mégis jelen leszek. Azt hogy naponta gyakoroljon, talán mondanom
sem kell. Írnia is fölösleges, de küldhet néhány fölvételt, hogy lássam
miként feszíti íját. És ne feledje: megváltozott a tanulás évei
folyamán, sok mindent másképpen lát és más mértékkel mér.



Búcsúzáskor egyik legjobb íját nyújtotta át nekem a mester:
- Ha ezzel az íjjal lő, érezni fogja jelenlétemet. Soha ne adja
kíváncsiskodók kezébe. Ha érdemtelen érintené, égesse hamuvá.
A ZEN-MŰVÉSZETEK MESTEREINEK MINDEGYIKE „a tökéletes
bölcsesség” felhőjének egy-egy villáma. Az „igazság” a mester
szellemében ölt testet. „Az” pedig azonos az igazsággal. Az igazság
azonban ezer formát és alakot ölt magára.
Akit ellenállhatatlanul a végső cél felé hajt a vágya, rá kell lépjen a
„művészet-nélküli-művészet” ösvényére. Rá kell szánnia magát a
végső ugrásra, hogy végül eggyé válhassék az igazsággal.
A fáradhatatlanul törekvő kezdővé, tanítvánnyá válik újra és újra,
hogy az út utolsó és legmeredekebb szakaszát is leküzdhesse.
A merész nekiindul, a bátor kiállja a próbát.
Tudja, hogy egyszer találkozik a hasonlíthatatlan, igazságok fölött
álló IGAZSÁGGAL, mindenek őseredeti, alakot-nélkülöző
ősforrásával, a határtalan ürességgel, ami a beavatatlan számára
„semmi”; a MINDENNEL, amely elnyeli és amelyből újraszületik.
Jegyzetek:
1/ E téma gyakran képezi „mondo” tartalmát
2/ A „zagu” ama tárgyak egyike, amelyeket a zen-szerzetes
magával hord. Ezt teríti maga elé, ha a Buddha képmása, vagy
mestere előtt meghajol.
3/ Megtisztulás: a gyakorlatokat zavaró gondolatok mellőzése. A
gondolatoknak az íj formájára, nevezetesen ama tartalomra való
terelése, amelyet ez a forma kifejez.
Beavatás: a húr hangja rezonál a hallgatóban, „fölavatja” az
íjászattal való foglalkozásra.

Seymour: Bemutatás
Tandori Dezső fordítása
(részlet)
Mint már említettem, Seymour bizonyos játékokban meglepően jó
volt. Hozzá kellene tennem: néha megbocsáthatatlanul jó. Mit is
akarok mondani ezzel: azt, hogy van a sportban és a játékban a
tökéletességnek egy olyan foka, melytől mindig dühbe jövünk, ha azt



nem igazi ellenfél produkálja, valamiféle tőrőlmetszett alak,
nevezetesen egy stílustalan alak, egy felvágós alak, vagy egész
egyszerűen egy százszázalékosan amerikai alak; s ebbe a
felsorolásba a lehetséges ellenfelek egészszéles skálája beletartozik,
kezdve azokon, akik olcsó és meglehetősen nyavalyás eszközökkel
győznek ellenünk, egészen azokig, akik teljesen felesleges módon
még boldogságot sugárzón, kimondottan jóképűen néznek szembe
velünk. Seymour stílustalansága a különféle játékokban kétségtelenül
csak egyik bűne volt; annyi azonban bizonyos, hogy az egyik főbűne.
Különösen három játékra gondolok itt: stoopball-ra, golyózásra és
rexezésre. (A rexezésről majd egyszer külön kell írnom. Ez ugyanis
már-már nem is játékszámbament nálunk, majdhogynem ez volt
maga a reformáció. Serdülő- és kamaszkorunk majdnem minden
nagyobb válsága előtt vagy után rexeztünk.) Vidéki olvasók
tájékoztatására: a stoopball olyan játék, melynél okvetlenül valami
nagy kőlépcsőre vagy házfalra van szükség. Úgy játszottuk, hogy
egy-egy gumilabdát valamelyik ház falához, illetve homlokzatához
vágtunk – a Manhattanben divatos görög-ióni vagy római-korinthoszi
homlokzatokhoz –, méghozzá csípőmagasságan. Ha a labda úgy
vágódott vissza az úttestre vagy a szemközti járdára, hogy közben
az ellenfél csapatából senki nem tudta elcsípni, az jó pontot jelentett
a labdát megjátszó csapat számára, oly módon, mint a baseballnál;
ha viszont elcsípték a labdát – és általában ez volt a természetes –, a
játékosnak, aki dobta, ki kellett állnia. A legértékesebbnek azonban
az a dobás számított, amikor a labda éppen eléggé magasan és
erősen szállt ahhoz, hogy a szemközti falra verődjön, anélkül, hogy
közben leszednék. A mi időnkben sok olyan labda repült, mely elérte
a szemközti falat, de csak nagyon kevésszer sikerült olyan gyorsan,
alacsonyan és ügyesen dobni, hogy le ne szedhesse az ellenfél.
Seymour viszont, ha játszott, majdnem minden alkalommal szerzett
ilyen pontot. Ha mások szereztek, többnyire mázlinak tartották
hogy ezenfelül örvendetesnek-e, vagy sem, ez már mindig attól



függött, melyik csapatba tartozott az illető –, Seymournál azonban az
volt a mázli, ha nem szerzett ilyen pontot. Ami ennél még jobban
idevág: úgy tudta hajítani a labdát, olyan technikával, ahogy rajta
kívül senki más a környéken. Mi többiek, akik általában, ugyanúgy,
mint ő, jobbkezesek voltunk, egy kicsit balra húzódtunk a falra rajzolt
kockás célfelülethez képest, és karunk gyors oldalmozdulatával
hajítottuk el a labdát. Seymour azonban egyenesen a célsíkkal
szemben helyezkedett el dobás előtt, és egyenesen rádobott
olyasféle mozdulattal, ami nagyon emlékeztetett pingpongbeli
csúnya és teljességgel eredménytelen lecsapásaira –, és azután
anélkül, hogy különösebben le kellett volna hajolnia, elzúgott a feje
felett a labda, hogy úgy mondjam, a kiadó helyekre. Ha az ember
megpróbálkozott vele, hogy ugyanúgy csinálja, mint ő (akár titokban,
akár csakugyan az ő fanatikus személyes utasítására), vagy mindjárt
kiesett az ember, vagy a nyavalyás labda úgy jött vissza, hogy
egyenesen az ember képébe vágódott. Eljött az az idő, amikor senki
nem akart vele stoopball-t játszani az egész környéken, én sem. És
akkor nagyon gyakran azzal töltötte az idejét, hogy vagy a húgainak
magyarázta a játék fogásait, vagy pedig egymaga játszott, amikor is
a labda a mögötte levő falról úgy pattant vissza mindig, hogy éppen
csak ki kellett nyúlnia érte, és elkapta anélkül, hogy egy tapodtat is
elmozdult volna egy álltó helyéből. (Igen, igen, nagyon belemegyek
itt a részletekbe, de harminc év után egyszerűen nem tudok ellenállni
a dolognak.) Golyózásnál ugyanilyen elképesztő volt, amit csinált.
Golyózásnál az első játékos elgurítja vagy ellöki a golyóját hat vagy
hét méterre a csatornába, lehetőleg minél szorosabban a járda
pereme mellett (természetesen olyan mellékutcában, ahol nem
nagyon parkolnak autók). A másik azután megpróbálja eltalálni a
magáéval, miközben ugyanarról a kiindulópontról lök. Ez ritkán
sikerül, hiszen majdnem mindig akad valami, ami kitéríti a golyót
eredeti útjából: az úttest egyenetlen felszíne, vagy ha a játékos
ügyetlenül löki neki a golyót a járdaszegélynek, egy darab rágógumi,



bármi a sok-sok száz elhajigált apróságból, ami New York
mellékutcáit jellemzi – nem is szólva arról, hogy lehet már eleve
rosszul célozni is. Ha viszont a második játékos lövése mellément,
golyója általában igen kedvezőtlen helyzetbe kerül, az első játékos
nagyon könnyen eltalálhatja most már az ő golyójával. Százból
nyolcvan vagy kilencven esetben Seymour verhetetlennek bizonyult
ebben a játékban, akár elsőnek lökött, akár másodiknak. Nagy
távolságok esetében széles ívben lökte ki golyóját, olyasféleképpen,
mint a bowling-nál, ha a büntetőterület külső jobb sarkáról kerül sor
dobásra. Ebben a játékban is kitűnt azonban, mennyire eltér egész
tartása, stílusa a szokásostól, az igazitól. Míg a környéken mindenki a
kezével, az ujjai irányításával lökött „hosszút”, Seymour karjának
helyesebben, csuklójának – valami oldalmozgásával indította el a
golyót, olyasféle mozdulattal, mint ahogy egy lapos követ dobunk el,
mellyel azt akarjuk, hogy kacsázzon a vízen. És itt is teljesen
reménytelen vállalkozás volt, ha valaki megpróbálta utánozni őt.
Mihelyt az ő módszerével próbáltunk lökni, végképp elvesztettük
uralmunkat a golyó felett.
Arra, ami most jön, azt hiszem, tudatom megfelelő része
szabályosan – és eléggé csúnyán – lesett. Évek óta nem is
gondoltam tudniillik az egészre.
Egy napon késő délután, a délutánnak abban az időszakában, amikor
New Yorkban kigyulladnak az utcai lámpák, s amikor az autók lámpái
is kezdenek felfényleni – egyesek már világítanak, mások még nem –,
a házunkkal szemben nyíló mellékutca csendesebbik részén
golyóztam egy Ira Yankauer nevezetű fiúval. Nyolcéves voltam.
Seymour technikáját próbáltam alkalmazni, újra meg újra
kísérleteztem vele – ezzel az oldalról kacsázva lökéssel, ahogy ő,
széles ívben próbáltam rávinni golyómat ellenfelemére –, és újra meg
újra veszítettem. Egyhuzamban, de különösebb szívfájdalom nélkül.
Mert, mint már mondtam, ez volt a délutánnak éppen az az órája,



amikor a New York-i fiúk ugyanolyanok, mint a tiffiniek, ohióiak, akik
miközben a legutolsó tehén is eltűnik az istállóajtóban – távoli
vonatfüttyöt hallanak az alkonyatban. És ha valaki ebben a bűvös
negyedórányi időben elveszíti a golyóit, hát elveszíti, nagy baj nem
történik. Azt hiszem, Ira is ugyanígy kívül állt az időn, és ha ő nyert, ő
sem nyert egyebet, mint éppen csak golyókat. És ebben a csendben,
mondhatnám teljes összhangban ezzel a csenddel, egyszer csak
Seymour szólított. Megijedtem, de ez nagyon kellemes fajtarémület
volt, nevezetesen, hogy él még rajtam kívül egy ember a
világmindenségben, s ehhez az érzéshez még csak hozzájárult az a
helyeslét, hogy ez az ember pont Seymour. Megfordultam, szinte
megpördültem, és azt hiszem, Ira ugyanígy. A házunkkal szemben
húzódó árkádsor alatt éppen kigyulladtak a fények. Seymour pedig
ott állt a járda szélén, velünk szemközt, a túlsó oldalon, az úttest
szegélyén egyensúlyozott, kezét bélelt báránybőr kabátjának
zsebébe dugva. Mivel a fények mind mögötte gyúltak ki, arca
árnyékban volt, mintha elúszott volna az alkonyattal. Tízéves volt.
Ahogy ott egyensúlyozott a járda szélén, ahogy a kezét tartotta,
ahogy – nos, benne volt az egész X-tényező, és akkor is tudtam, és
most is tudom, hogy ő is teljességgel tudatában volt a kivételes
pillanatnak. – Nem próbálnád meg, hogy ne célozz annyira?
kérdezte tőlem, még mindig onnan a járda széléről. – Mert ha célzol
és találsz, az csak véletlen. – Megszólított, de szavai nem törték meg
a varázst. – Hogy lenne véletlen, ha célzok? – feleltem én (bár itt
most kurzívval írom) egyáltalán nem hangosan, de azért ott rezgett
valami irritáltság is a hangomban, és éreztem is. Ő egy pillanatig nem
felelt, csak ott állt a járda szegélyén himbálózva, és – legalábbis úgy
éreztem – szeretettel nézett. – Mivel – mondta –, ugye, örülnél, ha a
golyóját, Ira golyóját, eltalálnád, vagy nem? Ugye, örülnél? És ha már
örülsz, hogy eltalálsz egy golyót, hát akkor nem nagyon számíthattál
rá, hogy csakugyan eltalálod. Kell mégis valami szerencse a
dologhoz, kell egy kis véletlen mindenképpen. – Kezét még mindig



kabátja ferde vágású zsebében tartva, lelépett a járdaszegélyről, és
odajött hozzánk. Egy gondolataiba mélyedt Seymour azonban nem
jöhetett át gyorsan az úttesten, az alkonyatba hajló utcán, legalábbis
nem úgy festett a dolog. Ebben az alkonyi fényben inkább mintha
csak úgy vitorlázott volna felénk. A büszkeség azonban az egyik
leghirtelenebb érzés a világon, nem tűr haladékot; így hát mielőtt
Seymour még úgy két méterre lett volna tőlünk, gyorsan azt
mondtam Irának: – Sötétedik – és ezzel hatásos módon véget
vetettem a játéknak.
