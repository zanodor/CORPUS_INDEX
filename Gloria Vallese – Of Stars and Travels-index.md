Fig. 1. Venice, St. Mark, main portal, detail of the lower arch.
The main portal of St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice has three wide concentric arches, arranged in
diminishing order, each decorated with bas-reliefs in the front and intrados. Built between the
XII-XIII centuries, this portal with its extraordinary sculptural ornamentation marks the
development from early Romanic to a full developed Gothic style.
The authors are unknown; it is commonly agreed, however, that they were sculptors from
Northern Italy, very near to those operating in Ferrara, Verona and Modena in the same age.

Where not differently stated, the photos of St.Mark’s portal are by the author.
Very famous and widely discussed are the sculptural cycles of the middle and upper arch,
representing the Twelve Months and the Venetian Crafts.
The inferior arch, which is also the oldest, seems to have enjoyed less fortune so far, also for
the persistent difficulty in identifying its general iconographic theme. It shows a
sequence of hunters, animals and hybrid monsters, among rich vegetal volutes.At the basis of
the intrados, two human figures, male and female, sit each on a double-headed snake; the
branch that frames the entire composition seems to originate from behind their upraised
hands. (Figg.1,2,3)



!3
So far, this couple has been interpreted variously as the Ocean and the Earth, the Church
and the sin, or also Devil and Lust. Consequently, the hybrid figures and the monstrous wars
represented among the foliage would symbolize scenes of the human struggle with sin, or
the life of the instincts as opposed to the orderly sequence of works and days depicted in the
arches above1.
With this article, I would like to bring elements for a rather different reading, which identifies
in this lower arch a series of astronomical representations. In the human
figures in bizarre attitudes, in the hybrids, in the hunting scenes, I propose to see images of
constellations, or of individual stars, interchained not randomly, but according to a well
calculated disposition that develops a double annual calendar
cycle, solar and lunar.
More than often, stars and constellations are represented not according to the more familiar
Western iconography, but in a fascinating mix of elements and languages from
different places, in reference to the special position of Venice in
the Mediterranean and to the long journeys to the East.
1. Navigations and travels
After the first millennium A.D., the relationships between Europe and the Near and Far East,
on the double side of commerce and war, increase: Persia, lndia and China mix more and
more their images with those of the Western tradition. Among the figures of pre-classical
tradition that re-emerge in the so-called "marginal" sculpture of religious and civil buildings,

we find representations of constellations, or of individual stars, displayed and described in a
non-Western way.
The lower arch of St Mark’s main portal, a work full of symbols of this kind, has become
over time entirely obscure. But it was not meant to be so from the start. On the contrary, the
Venetians who conceived this representation must have been deeply familiar with the
characters, objects and animals that allowed to identify the groups of stars and their
movement in the heavens. We should evoke a scenario in which celestial navigation
was the main instrument for travels, not only by sea, but also by land: caravans, such as the
ones which traveled along the Asian Silk Road, relied in fact on the stars, especially in the
large sandy deserts with no other visual reference. Oral lore, rhymes and fairy
tales, now partially or completely forgotten, such as those collected a few years ago by
Clinton Bailey among the Bedouins of the Sinai and the Negev, were essential for the
preservation and transmission of such contents2.
Archaeoastronomy and ethnoastronomy, two comparatively young disciplines, are quickly
bringing light into the subject with their rapid progress.
Now the sense of many seemingly incongruous presences in the European decorative cycles,
with no apparent relation with the themes of Christian iconography, appears less difficult to
explain.
Many of the figures, which appeared bizarre in their pairings and attitudes, disturbing in
their animal-human hybridism, and very explicit and transgressive in their sexuality, have
become identifiable as representations of individual stars, or constellations, or of some
special astronomical conjunctions, often in pre-Greek versions of the myth, the tenacious
tradition of which can be traced back to very ancient times, sometimes as far back as the
Neolithic age.

2. The two Eagles (“Aquiloni”)
In the central section of St. Mark’s lower intrados, at the top, we see two birds of prey,
placed symmetrically on either side of a complex vegetal knot: on the left, an eagle (or
falcon) soaring with prey (a hare or young deer) in its claws; on the right, an eagle-falcon
swooping on the prey. (Figg. 4,5)
One is reminded of the two classic names: "Vultur Volans" and
"Vultur Cadens", given respectively to Altair (α Aquilae), and Vega (α
Lyrae), two of the brightest stars in the northern hemisphere. Altair
and Vega are part of an asterism (i.e. a recognizable group of stars) very important for the



!6
travelers, the so-called "Summer Triangle”. Altair and Vega were the main indicators for
those who turned their course to the North. The upper vertex of the Summer Triangle is
formed by a third star, Deneb (α Cygni), which we shall considered later.
Ian Ridpath writes about Vega:
"Ptolemy knew the constellation’s brightest star simply as Lyra. The name we use for this star
today, Vega,comes from the Arabic words ‘al-nasr al-waqi’ that can mean either ‘the swooping
eagle’ or ‘vulture’, for the Arabs saw both an eagle and a vulture here (...). It seems that the
Arabs visualized Vega and its two nearby stars ε and ζ Lyrae as an eagle with folded wings,
swooping down on its prey, whereas in the nearby constellation Aquila the star Altair and its two
attendant stars gave the impression of a flying eagle with wings outstretched”.3
Ptolemy called this star Aetus, eagle, extending the same name to the whole constellation.
Also the Sumerians and Babylonians called Altair "Star eagle", testifying to an even more
remote origin of the name.
Ridpath concludes his discussion evoking a charming Chinese myth, which identified the
stars of Aquila and those of Lyra as two lovers separated by the river of the Milky Way.
The two could meet only one day a year, when the magpies formed a bridge between
them across the Milky Way.
This tale has no relation with St.Mark’s portal, but helps us to focus on Altair and Vega’s
symmetrical placement at the top of the sky.
Altair, the Rising Eagle, appears as indicative of the direction of the north in the famous
map (1527-39) composed by the Scandinavian bishop Olaus Magnus. (Fig. 6)

It also appears in the middle of the indicator in some of the oldest known astrolabes, as
an invitation to the operator to aim the instrument towards the corresponding star to find
the North.6
Aquiloni (“the big eagles”) is the ancient name given in Italy to the winds from the north or
northeast, from the Latin term aquilo, aquilonis (m), with the same meaning.7
The two eagles, one in the act of plunging, the other in the act of soaring
with its prey, appear also in many Venetian patere, which from now on, with the
contextual clarification coming from St. Mark’s main portal, can begin to be recognized as

the heraldic devices of traveling merchants, placed on the facades of their houses
warehouses to indicate journeys.8 (Figg.7,8)
Vega and Altair, as already mentioned, form the basis of the 'Summer Triangle', and this
evoked in the mind of the historical observer the upper vertex of the Triangle, located at a
point outside of the arch itself, in the ideal direction of the star Deneb. of the constellation
Cygnus (Fig.9)
To this point, very important for the reconstruction of the possible iconographic original
project of the cycle, we shall go back in the conclusion.
8.The patere are ornaments in form of roundels, carved in stone, carachteristic of the facades of old houses and churches in Venice. Patere representing the eagle plunging on the prey, or soaring with it, are frequent: Rizzi and Swiechowski have catalogued more than a hundred, some of which even earlier than St. Mark’s relief: André Grabar (introduction), Alberto Rizzi and Zygmunt Swiechowski, Romanische Reliefs von venezianischen Fassaden:"*patere e formelle”, Wiesbaden, Steiner, 1982; Alberto Rizzi, Scultura esterna a Venezia, Corpus delle sculture erratiche all’aperto di Venezia e della sua laguna, Venezia, Stamperia di Venezia Editrice, s.d [1987]. The iconographic details (such as the part of the body in which the prey is clawed and/or bitten) have recurrent variants, suggesting the further declination of a symbolic language. The matter is currently under study and classification by Bruna Barros, a student the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice .

3. Vulpecula cum Anser
Moving out from the Eagles along the intrados, we find a number of other representations
that can be related to astronomical iconography.
On the left (for the observer entering the church), we find Vulpecula, the Little Fox (from
some ancient sources, in the remote past perhaps this was not a fox, but a hyena or jackal).
Its condition is bizarre: more than to be the predator, it appears to suffer the attak of the
bird, here a rooster, perched above it on a sort of long overhanging raceme. (Figg.11,12)
According to the modern celestial atlases, Vulpecula is located in the northern sky, in the
vicinity of Altair the Eagle. It appears to be a constellation of comparatively recent origin,
having been introduced by Johannes Hevelius in the seventeenth century. The Polish
astronomer described in the vicinity of the Eagle an asterism in the form of a canid, poised
as to grab a bird by its neck.
Hevelius saw in this bird a goose, naming the characteristic group in the sky Vulpecula cum
Anser. (Fig.13)

Uranographia, Gdansk 1690



!14
We can observe, however, that Hevelius did not invent anything new here; rather, he revived
something that had already been seen in this part of the northern sky in very ancient times.
A small canid with pointed ears appears already in the Egyptian celestial map known as
"the Zodiac of Dendera" (II century BC), where it appears to be longing for a bird perched
on a higher position (there, the falcon-god Horus, with the double crown Pschent on its
head). A similar configuration, a canid in the vicinity of the two Eagles, was seen in this
celestial region also by the Assyrian-Babylonian.9
In the "Zodiac of Dendera", a void curved space extends to divide the two figures of the
canid and the bird, creating the impression that the volatile is overhanging or 'dominating'
the predator, towards which the latter reaches without being able to grab it; just as it seems
to happen, by means of the long curved raceme, in the Venetian relief.10 (Figg.14,15)
4. Two animals, placed back to back
In the corresponding location on the other side of the intrados, we see a group which can be
described as a wolf that bites a sheep at the throat; very unique and characteristic, however,
is the position of the two animals, placed back to back.
This configuration brings us again back to the "Zodiac of Dendera".
The Egyptians, as we know, represented the circumpolar constellations very differently from
how we know them; near the North celestial pole, in place of our two Bears and Dragon,
they saw the ‘Thigh of the Ox', plus a Hippo pointing a sort of knife or ploughshare
towards the ground, then the Canid and bird described before, plus two characteristic
animals juxtaposed at the back.
9.Gavin White, Babylonian Star-Lore, London, Solaria, 2008, p.163 and App.1, pp. 246-247.
10.It is possible that this bizarre collocation of the celestial bird, which seems to ‘dominate’ the fox, may be at the root of the popular Medieval myth of the ‘vengeance’ of the hens, within the larger paradoxical saga of the ‘World Upside Down’. A scene of ‘reversed hunt’ in which two cocks bring in triumph, as a prey, a captured fox, suspended by the paws to a pole, appears inside St. Mark’s church’, in one of the thirteenth-century mosaics of the litostrathi: Giuseppe Cocchiara, Il mondo alla rovescia (1956), Torino, Boringhieri, 1980, pp. 200-08, figg.

!17
It is very striking to come across a second detail so singularly evocative of the Egyptian
prototype in the Venetian portal; I have, however, not been able to identify other precedents
for this singular representation.
5. The two dromedaries
The two dromedaries which seem to cross their path on the left half of the intrados are
another striking feature of St.Mark’s reliefs, being a rather immediate evocation of the
Middle-Eastern world.
It is in the Bedouin star-lore that the camels describe a group of stars typical of
the winter-spring sky: the constellation of Taurus the Bull. On the muzzle of the
Zodiacal Bull, next to the big red star Aldebaran, seen in the ancient times as the dilatated
and inflamed eye of the animal, there appear a group of many tiny bright white stars
arranged in a ‘V’ shape ( Figg.16,17,18). The Greeks called these stars Hyades, making
them female personifications. According to the Bedouin tradition, however, the Hyades
were the many little white dromedar fowls that al Debaràn (“the Follower", or “Suitor")
brought to the nearby Pleiades, seven beautiful young sisters, to conquer them. He had
asked them one first time, but he had been rejected, because they thought him to be too
poor. Al Debaràn left, but then came back, pushing ahead the many small snow-white fowls
as a testimony of his wealth, and this time they accepted him.
The name 'Aldebaran' is sometimes used collectively, to designate both the bright big orange
star and the tiny white Hyades; so we find it used in the Almagest of 1515, and in the Tavole
Alfonsine of 1521, where appears the expression "sunt stellae aldebaran".11
In St. Mark’s portal, the camel "goes" and then “comes back", as in the Bedouin legend; the
peculiar structure of the image, with two symmetrical figures, may suggest the movement
"to" and “back" of the constant lover, but also of the travelers, following the orientation of
the stellar group first in one direction and then in the other (the same question, as we shall
see, pose the two cranes that form the corresponding group on the opposite side of the
intrados).
However, the European traditional lore attributes to the Hyades (and to the nearby Pleiades,
(of whom more below), the peculiarity of being bearers of rain. Their rising, more
generally the entrance of the Sun in Taurus, marks the beginning of a period of seasonal
rains, the characteristic spring downpours that encourage vegetation and cause the reverdie,
as reminds us the old English nursery rhyme Green Grow the Rushes, O.

Ovid, in his Fasti, asserts that the name derives from the ancient Greek word "hyein", which
means "rain", so that the name Hyades would mean "The Rainy".
According to the Greek myth (not in relation, however, as we have just seen, with St.
Mark’s representation), the Hyades were the daughters of Atlas and of the Oceanid Aethra.
Their older brother Hyas was a hunter, who was killed one day by a lioness. The sisters wept
inconsolably (Hyginus asserts that they died of pain), and because of this they were placed
in the sky. Therefore, it seems possible that they did not take their name from “hyein”, rain,
but from Hyas, the hunter.12

Of waters and rain, and more generally of the changing weather conditions in relation to
the winds, the entire sculptural cycle talks almost at every point. This is appropriate for a
city of sailors like Venice, and it is probably in reference to a structure such as the Rose of
the Winds. (Fig. 22)
We will return to this aspect in our general concluding remarks.
It is worth noting at this point, however, that in the thirteenth century, which is probably the
epoch of St.Mark’s cycle, the astrolabe was just starting its diffusion; the compass existed in
China, and was just beginning to appear in the Western world, while the Rose of the
Winds, put into use by the Greeks and theorized by Aristotle, was already used by the Arabs
about the the tenth century.
The sculptural decoration of the main St.Mark’s portal, with its astronomical world rich in
references to the Mediterranean and to Asia, is from this point of view an extraordinary
document, awaiting further investigation and research.

6. The two gruiformes
No less exotic than the two dromedaries are the two cranes that intertwine their necks
on the opposite side of the intrados (Fig. 11). Like other configurations already mentioned,
the couple of gruiforme birds is represented often in the patere. The patere also are
possibly in relation with the long journeys which brought
theVenetians, by land or through the Indian Ocean, to India,
Thailand, and China.
Grus, the Crane, is one of a group of constellations placed around or below the
Tropic of Capricorn.
Having, almost without exception, birdlike configurations, these constellations are
collectively referred to as “The Southern Birds”; among them we find the Crane,
the Peacock, the Phoenix, the Dove of Noah.
Crane and Phoenix interest us here in particular. Grus is one of the twelve constellations that
were described by the Flemish cartographer Petrus Plancius, who in turn based himself on
the observations of the Dutch travelers Pieter Keyser and Frederick de Houtman.
Grus made its first appearance on a celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by
Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius, and was included by Johann Bayer in his star atlas
Uranometria in 1603.13
Cranes with intertwined necks are a very common subject in the Venetian patere,
some of which are contemporary or even older than this St. Mark’s arch. If, as we propose
here, their meaning is to be found in the astronomical iconograpy, this could prove that the
observations of the Dutch travelers and cartographers a few centuries later, though reliable,
were not original as they claimed.
As in the case of the two dromedaries, the opposed and symmetrical position of the two
cranes in St. Mark’s relief can be taken as indicative of a round trip to and back from Asia
through the Indian Ocean, where these stars may have been used as a reference.
It is also possible, however, given the proximity and symmetry of position of Grus with the
nearby constellation of Phoenix, that a trip to the East entailed both constellations, or even
Phoenix only.

The unsustainability of De Keyser and Houtman’s statements is also proven by the Italian print by Giorgio Ghisi known as The Allegory of Life. Dated 1561, this beautiful burin is very clearly an illustration of Manilius’ Astronomica (V, 40-51), in the chapter where he describes the temperament of men born under the constellation Argo Navis. In the exotic landscape on the right, we can observethe Southern constellations Indus, Pavo, Columba and Phoenix. (Fig.21)

!25
The legendary Phoenix, in fact, appears to have been an aironid, perhaps
identifiable with the bennu bird of the ancient Egyptians, which was 'set to fire' by the solstice
setting sun, on its tamarisk trees by the shrine of Heliopolis.14
The cranes of central-eastern Europe migrate eastward and to the South between August
and October,, where their transit is seen as a sign of approaching of the winter season:
“Mark, when you hear the voice of the crane who cries year by year from the clouds above, for
she give the signal for ploughing and shows the season of rainy winter.”15
To understand better how the two waders in the Venetian arch may indicate the
direction of Phoenicia, we must begin to consider the overall scheme.
Connecting the astronomic references so far observed with the Rose of the Winds,
in a version compatible with the period of construction of the Venetian arch, a scheme
emerges, in which the representations on St. Mark seem to be arranged along the main
cercles of declination of the celestial sphere. Before considering this more in depth,
however, let’s examine more in detail the remaining groups along the intrados, and begin to
consider the archivolt.
14.About the star Ankaa (α Phoenicis), and its identification with the bennu bird of the Egyptians, see Richard H. Allen, Star Names, Their Lore and Meaning, cit., http://www.constellationsofwords.com/ stars/Ankaa.html (Retr. March 25, 2015).

7. Lion attacking a deer
On the left side as we enter, below the two dromedaries, we find the representation of
a deer, bitten on the shoulder by a lion suddenly attacking it with a back
leap. (Fig. 23)
This is, for the reasons that I shall point out, a possible representation of the winter
solstice, the moment in which the Sun-Lion, rising between the deer's antlers, begins the
annual cycle of growth towards its culmination in the summer.
The deer’s antlers is one of several ancient visualizations of the winter’s dark demon which
imprisons the sun. Another visualization, handed down to us through the Greek zodiac,
presents the horns of the black animal as the claws of the Scorpion. In the ancient Egypt,
the jaws of the Scarab had the symbolic function of custody and deliverance of the Sun
from its winter/night captivity.



!26
An interesting study by Ida Bobula describes the relationships between the deer or elk as
animal of the winter solstice, and his his alias-enemy-ally, the benevolent god father of the
vegetation, which in the Venetian arch we find represented immediately below.15
8. Sirius
While the lion attacking the deer represents the first act of rescue of the sun against the
winter darkness, on the opposite side of the intrados we see the lion, weakened, fall on his
back, overcome by a child. (Fig. 3) There is reason to believe that this powerful little child is
here to represent the star Sirius.
For the Egyptians, the rising of Sirius indicated the advent of the flood of the Nile, then a
period of prosperity and fertility. The observation of the star Sirius was important to the
point that from the first day of its helical rising, the Egyptians started their 360-day
calendar, a calculation of the annual cycle which has been handed down to us almost
unchanged for its great precision and functionality. Sirius is part of the constellation Canis
Major, the Dog of Heaven. Displayed as standing on its hind legs, with Sirius as a jewel
that sparkles at the collar, the Dog appeared on the western horizon in the middle of
the summer, following the zodiacal constellation of Leo the Lion, and marked the climax
and then the end of the period of heat and aridity designated with the name of
'Canicula' (in English, 'Dog Days').
The representation of Sirius in the form of child stems from its connection with Isis; he was
‘sent forth’ by her, as her ‘soul’, or emanation.
With the realm of Sirius, the weather changed, and the empire of the sun-lion ceased:
hence this representation on the right side of the arch, closely related, as the previous one,
with the figure below, the woman with snakes. Leaves seem to sprout from her upraised
hands, a possible representation of the autumn equinox and of the renewal of autumn
vegetation.
In tropical latitudes, the end of the summer represents the beginning of a second season
almost symmetrical to the spring, after the middle interval of the summer aridity. In ancient
Mesopotamia, spring and autumn were marked by two granary crops of equal importance:
barley in the spring, wheat in autumn.

The two moments of fertility and lushness of the vegetation were associated with a couple
of symmetrical divinities. In Mesopotamia, the fecundity of spring was represented by the
god-shepherd Dumuzi/Tammuz; the fecundity of autumn, by his sister Gestihanna.
16In many other ancient civilizations, the autumn vegetation and the season of the fruits
were related to female deities, such as the Greek/Latin Demetra/Ceres with her
daughter Persephone/Proserpina, and with the stars associated with them (the zodiacal
constellation Virgo, with its two main stars Spica and Vindimiatrix).

With these Mediterranean myths of vegetation, and their male-female figures of deities
connected to the growth and decline of the annual course of the sun, we introduce the two
carachters from which the inhabited branch of the intrados originates, and which are nodal
for the interpretation of the entire cycle: namely, the man and woman sitting/crouching on
both sides at the basis of the intrados.
9. "Man / Woman of snakes"
The representation on the left shows, as already mentioned, a mature man, squatting/
sitting with knees wide apart over a huge snake. (Figg.23, 24) The snake is winged, and has
two heads of different sizes: these details characterize the Asian moon dragon, to which our
character, as we shall see, is connected.
Below the sitting man, the serpent forms a sort of round spire, delineating a sort of cavity,
or vortex.
Two minor snakes come out of the mouth of the figure and wrap around his arms, then
descend to bite his ankles.
The old man, unperturbed, raises his hands, and behind him leaves and branches sprout; so
does, on the opposite side of the arch, his female counterpart, also sitting on a winged two
headed reptile oriented in the opposite way. (Fig.25)
As already said above, in many cultures all over the planet is present under various names,
from the remotest antiquity, the benevolent figure of a 'father of vegetation' that helps the
sun to emerge from its winter captivity. He is patron of the waters, kind to mankind, gives it
agriculture and endows it with laws, sets to save it from the flood entrusting it to an elected
of his capable of building the ark; above all, he sets free the sun everyday, or every season,
from its black captivity beyond the mountains, crushing or overcoming somehow the
horned/clawed animal that holds him captive.
The characterization of the figure in the Venice arch is rooted in the ancient Enki/Ea/
Aquarius of the Sumerians, Akkadians and Babylonians; as the corresponding
female figure on the opposite side, with a spiral knotted on her head adorned with braids,
has significant points of contact with his wife Ninhursag/Ninmah/Damgulanna, to and
many similar goddess of vegetation and water, from whose heads braids pour
abundant, curving into spirals.(Fig. 28)
These two extremes are symbolic of the annual cycle: the appearance of Enki/Aquarius at
the winter solstice is symbolic of the day overcoming the night, the melting of ice, the
rebirth of vegetation after the winter pause; as well as the rising of his female counterpart
symbolizes the vegetative rebirth and fruit ripening in autumn, after the summer
aridity. The braids, the snakes, the archaic rigidity of the female figure in Venice, the cone
of spires that surrounds her head, are in tune with the remote representations of the
Assyrian Ninhursag, as it is the snake sucking her breast.

10. The Ophiuchus
The Venetian'"snake man" has a very close analogue in a Persian celestial sphere, now
in the British Museum, in which some parts of the ancient Middle-Eastern god of
the vegetation have been conflated with those of the constellation Ophiuchus or
Serpentarius.17
According to Medieval Islamic astronomy (Al-Sufi’s Uranometry, X century), the constellation
corresponding to the Greek Ophiucus is designated as 'the snake charmer': the celestial
Ophiuchus appears as a man, mature or elderly, which holds in his arms a colossal snake,
which he seems to dominate heroically, despite the tight coils in which the giant reptile
wraps him.
This constellation has a special place in the heavens: with one foot just below the encliptic,
Ophiuchus seems to tread the chest of the Scorpion, and rotates along with the other signs
of the Zodiac, so that it can be considered, in some ways, one of them. (Figg.31, 32)
This helps us to understand the Ophiuchus/Serpentarius role in the annual cycle:
trampling Scorpio at the end of the winter, he helps the sun to overcome the
black claws that imprison him, and to rise again into the spring sky.
In a Chinese funeral pall of the second century BC, a stocky telamone wrapped in snakes’
coils supports, like an atlas, the Earth above. The situation, the pose, the drap across the
knees, and the symbolic curves and nodes that define the Chinese composition, resemble
singularly the rhythmic curves, paused by knots, which frame the Venetian intrados. (Figg.2)
17.North-Eastern Iran, 1275-1276 AD. Inv. MEOA 1871.3.1 1.a.b.
This latter detail has suggested, as in a kind of hellish ‘retaliation', ideas of punishment of
the pleasures of lust; it is, in fact, a symbol of the synchrony between the ancient goddesses
of vegetation and the the celestial cycles, a detail that in the Vedic religious iconography
preserves its positive traits to this day. The Indian goddess Sita, daughter of the Earth, is
represented in the act of dancing, with hair in the form of a crest of leaves and fronds
emerging from behind her back; a snake knotted on itself appears in the act of biting one of
her exposed breasts. (Figg.26,27)
The figure in Venice can be approached in some ways even to the Egyptian Isis M’aat, in
the gesture, the pose, the attributes (except for the only detail of the frontal face, not
admissible in that context): crouched on one flexed knee, rising her arms, in the presence of
the snake, and also for the proximity of the child taming the lion, represented in the
intrados nearby.

11. The Green Man
In the ancient folklore of several parts of Europe and Asia appears the 'Green Man', face
mask or whole figure of an old man whose hands, hair and beard turn into branches and
leaves. There is a corresponding female figure, with abundant braids hanging from the
head, and snakes or other animals in the act of sucking her breast.
Images of the "Green Man" can be found also at the origins of Chinese civilization:
mountain men whose clothes, hair and beards sprout branches and leaves, and often carry
books or symbols of divine knowledge.18
The reconstruction of the possible calendric meaning of these ancient representations is
just at the beginning, but the elements in common with the Venetian representation are
remarkable.
Parallels can be found in numerous creations of Romanesque Europe, as in the frame of
the portal of St. Nicholas in Bari, or in San Pietro in Tuscania (Fig.27). In the capitals of
Anzy-le-Duc, France, the head of the female figure appears adorned with a crown of
scepters like that of the Sumerian and Mesopotamian deities. Her inward deflected knee,
similar to that of the Venice figure, is accompanied with the pouring of waters, or grains,
from a jar.
12. The snakes and the celestial motions
Before we go any further in the description of the Venetian 'Green Man' and of his female
counterpart, it is appropriate to see why this benevolent carachter, friend of the rebirth of
the sun and of the vegetation, is closely linked to a disturbing and frightening figure as the
snake.
The snake, the main negative carachter in the Judeo-Christian tradition, is the very cause
of the discredit of our Venetian figure, and even more of that of his partner, the female
carachter on the other side of the intrados.
A throughout discussion of the iconographic theme of the serpent in association with
myths of origin, creation, and cyclic regeneration of the cosmos exceeds the limits of this
article.
18. Patricio Bustamante, Fay Yao, Daniela Bustamante, The worship to the mountains: a study of the creation myths of the Chinese culture,«RupestreWeb », http://www.rupestreweb.info/china.html. Retr.23/03/15.The authors analyze the myths and folklore behind the visual representations of three archaic Chinese gods, Pan-Gu , Fu-Xi and Shen-Nong, highlighting how they were probably the humanization of three sacred mountains. The images show mature or elderly men often sitting with their legs apart, and whose bodies sprout branches and leaves. They hold in hand branches, or symbols of knowledge and wisdom, such as Yang/ Yin, or the sacred trigram. Sometimes, their legs end in snakes.



!35
For that, we defer to the extensive bibliography about snakes associated with vegetative
deities, the origins of creation, and the annual rebirth in most cultures of the planet.
However, it is generally recognized that, to describe the celestial motions which mankind
began to observe since very ancient times, the sinuous motion of the snake, and its
coiling into spirals, must have appeared a very effective natural analogue.
This is probably why the swaying of the snake is in almost all cultures associated with the
motions of the heavens and to the alternation of time cycles and seasons. Snakes, or figures
that end in snakes which wrap in braids or coils, appear in the creation myths of many
ancient civilizations.
In the Vedic tradition, the Lord Shiva creates things curdling matter from a primeval sea; to
do so, he screws a giant snake around a central pivot, operation which is sustained by the
cooperation of several other deities.
Ancient China presents the male-female couple of Fu-Xi and Wu-Xi, two heavenly twins
who survived the flood, and subsequently, with the consent of the Gods, married to
repopulate the world. They are represented embracing, with compass and square in hand,
redesigning the earth, their bodies ending in serpentine tails pleated at the bottom.19 (Fig. 15)
In the ancient Babylonian tradition, some archaic divinities known as the “Seated Gods" are
located at the top of the heavens, the lower half of their bodies ending in snakes; these at
times turn upwards and join above the head of the figure forming a circle, the mysterious
Ouroboros, symbol of cosmic cyclicity.20
The two snakes bit the Venetian ‘Green Man’ at the ankles, in the same point in which the
enclitic curve “hooks” the celestial Ophiucus/Serpentarius forcing him to rotate with the
Zodiac along the yearly apparent path of the sun.
The Mediterranean archaic goddesses held as a symbol two swinging snakes, and Typhon
the Titan, a forbidding archaic divinity later defeated by Zeus, had the legs ending in a
double snake tail. The cycle of death and rebirth of life in the cosmos, even if in its bad and
horrific side, was also part of the dark Gorgon, at whose waist two snakes are tied.

13. The snakes and the lunar dragon
The Western sky lore shows the snake-dragon in two different forms: one is in the
Constellation Draco the Dragon, near the North celestial pole, where it coils around the
axis, including the two Bears in its spires. Thuban, main star of the Dragon, was once the
North Star, before the rotation of the Earth’s axis caused it to move away from that nodal
position, to which it was succeeded by the current North Star, Polaris.
A second presence of the snake-dragon in Western classical cosmology is as a representation of
the lunar cycles. According to the Ptolemaic sky representation, the Moon and other celestial
bodies in the solar system seem to travel according to sinuous curves that approach to the
earth, then move far away. Many ancient civilizations described these rhythmic dances and
repeated movements as the rhytmical movement of a celestial serpent, which tightens and
loosens repeatedly its coils. A characteristic shape of omega distinguishes both the sceptre of
Ninhursag and the mane of Hathor, the ancient Egyptian goddess of fertility; the same
attribute connotates the Babylonian Inanna/Ishtar/Astarte, goddess of fertility.
The spiral movements of the moon in its annual cycle was represented as a dragon with an
head at this two ends, one larger and one smaller, or by a pair of ’s’ shaped horns. 'Head' and
'tail' of the moon snake, or dragon, are the so-called ‘lunar nodes’, two particular
astronomical points in which the Moon’s orbit orbit intersects the apparent path of the sun
around the earth (enclitic): they are two critical points of the sky in which full or partial eclipses
of the sun and moon are possible. In the Western tradition, these two points were represented
by the symbol omega (‘ascending’ node, also called North or Boreal node, Caput Draconis, or
Anabibazon), and inverted omega (‘descending’ node, also South node, Cauda Draconis,
Catabibazon). In the Vedic tradition, the lunar nodes, referred to as Rahu and Ketu,
were considered two celestial bodies in their own right, object of veneration, and
are frequently represented in amulets.21
A wall painting from the temple of Isis in Pompeii shows the phase of celestial life in which the
extremes of the two cosmic snakes get near one to the other: the boat of Isis approaches to the
one containing the dismembered remains of her husband. It is the moment in which the
goddess, having gathered all the remains of Osiris, prepares to render him to integrity and life;
meaning that the moon, ruling the flow of water, causes the Nile River to flow back to its bed,
and a new season of vegetation on the fertilized earth may begin. (Fig.35)
The fragment of an ancient (Roman?) marble carving, showing the head of an old man with a
double spiral lyre-shaped snake protruding from his mouth, can be found in St. Mark in
Venice,not far from the portal we are examining walled up in a corner of the building.(Fig.36)

14. Figures at the base of the archivolt
At the base of the lower external archivolt, St.Mark’s artist placed another male-female
couple.
On the left for those who enter, a female figure moves away towards the left. She is
riding a lion, and holds a branch shaped like an inverted omega, symbol of
the descending lunar node. On the right, a male figure moves away, riding a
bovine, and holding the opposite symbol, an element in the shape of an omega (Figg.
37,38)
The characteristic arrangement of the legs of the two characters, the adoring attitude of the
lion and the bull they are riding, tells us that the artist here is quoting from a different
calendar set, based not on the sun, but on the moon.
The reference to Asian tradition, namely Vedic, is here more explicit than ever: the
couple who rides the bull, and the lion or lioness, in fact
corresponds to the Indian pair of Lord Shiva and to his consort,
the goddess Parvati/Dhurga (Figg. 39, 40, 41, 42).
Unlike the Latin western world, ruled by the solar cycle (with the exception of the calculation
of Easter), the Assyrian-Babylonian tradition, the Jewish, and the Vedic tradition refer mainly
to a lunar calendar.
The Venetian arch puts an unique care in assimilating and
reconciling, in a symbolic weaving of admirable complexity,
these different visions of the cosmic order, highlighting the
common traits. Each group of figures in the archivolt, both those within the circles and
those in the gaps, corresponds to the seasonal intervals described in the intrados, as we will see
after having examined them individually.
This is a further evidence of the syncretic and multicultural vocation of the ancient Venice,
witnessed in many other parts of the decoration of the thirteenth-century St. Mark.

15.Top/right archivolt: Hercules and the Bears
At the top of the archivolt, above the Eagles, and slightly onto the right, we find a
memorable representation of the Engonasin, the obscure kneeling warrior of the Boreal
skies, generally identified in post-classical age with Heracles/Hercules in the act of
defeating the Nemean lion.
We propose to see the Engonasin in St.Mark’s heroic fighter, both for its location in
relation to the two Eagles, and because in his proximity we can see two bear-like animals,
staring belligerently at each other from opposite sides of the raceme.22 (Figg 43)
The mutual placement of these figures, the attitude and attributes of each, is precise
enough to open up a window on the representation system used by the unknown artist.
Comparing with a modern map of the North celestial pole, we see that the disposition of
the two legs of this warrior/Heracles in relation to the circle which encloses it has been
outlined in a way far from casual; as well as the protruding snouts of the bears. (Fig.44)
His shield has a shape that became typical around the last quarter of
the twelfth century, therefore very near the presumed date of execution of the
Venetian arch. This model of shield can be seen in every detail and functionality in the
Bayeux tapestry. It was endowed with a strap, called guige, which secured it to the chest, and
allowed the warrior to throw it behind the back to have both hands free for the melée that
followed the first attack.23
Lion and hero seem here, to some extent, the alter ego one of
the other: the man's hair heaves and undulates like a lion’s mane, as it was said to
happen to Celtic warriors in combat. The lion gnawes angrily the edge of the shield, in a
gesture reminiscent of the bersekr, the trance of combat fury typical of the warriors of
the North. Some Viking chess figures in walrus ivory preserved in the British Museum show
the warriors, representing the towers, in bersekr attitude, with eyes wide open and biting their
own shields with gritted teeth.24 (Fig. 45)
22.The identification of this carachter with Heracles has become general after the Renaissance. The Greek older tradition, however, saw here a figure similar but not identical, the obscure “Kneeling warrior”, Engonasi, or Engonasin: a fighter of whom nothing was known, except his collocation near the bears, the absence of the head, the carachteristic posture with the bent knee (from which the name). Remarked were his obscure determination in fighting, and his threading with one foot on the head of the constellation Draco, as per the beautiful description in Aratus, Phaenomena, 63-64.

These and other details in the Venetian representation of the warrior of the North, like the
dragonesque fibula piercing the cheek of the warrior, the decorations of the sword’s
pommel, and other ornaments, though needing further study, are Celtic references, and
create an atmosphere consistent with the Arctic circle. (Fig.47)
The constellation of Hercules, as shown with exemplar clarity by Coronelli’s
globe, threads on the Head of the Dragon, and guards the Antartic polar circle, the
boundary beyond which the Lion-Sun cannot rise further. Wearing his sardonic smile,
St.Mark’s northern warrior pushes him back, tied to him forever by this perpetual war. (Fig.
48)
The artist of the Venice portal insists on this unforgettable image, highlighting the
comparison between the sun as a physical star, to which this limit has been imposed, and the
Sun-Christ, who in the ancient hymns was called Sol Invictus, Sol nesciens occasum.
The overall design of the original central portal of St. Mark, as we shall see more in detail,
culminated in the image of the Sol Invictus, Christ represented twice, both in sculpture and
mosaic, in the center of the facade.25 (Fig. 22)
16. Upper left quadrant of the archivolt: Cepheus, Andromeda, Lacerta
The stars and constellations that the sculptor has introduced at this level correspond to
circumpolar constellations of the Northern hemisphere: on the left, in a position
corresponding to that of Hercules, we recognize Cepheus from the characteristic pose
of the legs, the weapon in his hand, his position on the surrounding circle.(Figg. 44, 49)
Between the constellations of the celestial sphere, Cepheus can be recognized by his
weapon and by the characteristic pose of his legs bent with the knees wide apart, near the
figures related to him: his wife Cassiopeia and their daughter Andromeda. According to the
Greek myth, the vain queen Cassiopeia had declared that her daughter was more beautiful
than all the sea nymphs of Poseidon. The sea nymphs complained with the god, who in
turn appealed to Zeus the supreme judge. The sentence was that, to appease the wrath of
Poseidon, the beautiful Andromeda was to be fed to a sea monster sent by the god.

25. Sol Invictus ("the unconquered Sun") was an epithet used for various religious deities in the late Roman Empire (Helios, El-Gabal, Mitra). All were unified , in the imperial age, into a “solar" monotheism. The title passed to the emperors, and later, after the of Christianism became the official state cult of the Roman Empire, to Christ himself. "Sol nesciens occasum, stella semper rutilans, semper clara” (“O never setting Sun, star
forever shining, forever clear”), sings the Laetabundus, a Christmas hymn dating back to the eleventh century or earlier .



!47
But the hero Perseus intervened to rescue the maiden, plunging from the heavens on the
winged horse Pegasus, and breaking the chains that tied the girl to a rock by the seaBizarre
as it may seem, Persian astronomers gave Andromeda a strange hybrid form, part
human, equine, and fish: the result of a mixture with other constellations nearby, which
appears to go back to the days of the Assyrian-Babylonian.26 In St.Mark, the human-horse
hybrid, (therefore a centaur), in Phrigian bonnet, stares defiantly at the monster crouching
at the other end of the circle, a miniature dragon that corresponds likely to the small
constellation once called Stellio, and now Lacerta, the Lizard. (Figg.50,51)
The names of Alpheratz, Alpherat, or Sirrah (α Andromedae) come from the Arabic Al Surratt
at Faras, the Navel of the Horse; the latter, once considered part of Pegasus, found itself
with time called The Navel of Andromeda, an anathomic detail put in good evidence by
St. Mark’s anonymous sculptor. Allen observes that the β star of the constellation, Mirach,
probably derives from the Arabic mi’zar, the belt, another detail highlighted here.27

17.Upper left quarter of the archivolt: Pleiades, Sagitta, Arctias (?)
Slightly lower on the same side, near the area of Taurus/Aldebaran, represented in the
intrados by the two dromedaries, we find on the archivolt one of the most memorable
representations of the whole cycle: a trail of kids who vandalize the raceme,
bending, twisting, kneading it in various ways. Just like a bunch of nippers who
climb the trees in spring, they steal some tiny birds from the nests which the artist has
represented among the foliage.(Fig. 52) This feature is, I believe, in connection with one of
the star cluster that have more deeply fascinated humanity at all times: the Pleiades. This
group of stars, of an intense white-blue splendor, can be observed in the sky near Taurus, at
a short distance from the Hyades. The importance given in the ancient times to this tiny
asterism is because it maked probably, a few thousand years before Christ, the vernal
equinox, a point from which it appears today slightly removed. (Figg.53,54)
The small group of stars is described differently in different cultures: some will see in the
Pleiades a group of warriors, or demigods (Caucasus, Japan), at times fearful and
devastating (Sumerian and Babylonian tradition). In the Greek view, the
Pleiades were women, seven graceful sisters, daughters of Atlas and Pleione;
hence the individual names by which they are known today.
In Scandinavian myths, as well as in Latin and Byzantine tradition, they are associated with
images of birds: a hen with six chickens all around her; for the Vikings, they were
Freyja’s hens (Freyja being the well known equivalent of Venus-Aphrodite in Norse
mythology).28
A Venetian patera with a rare iconography, showing six/seven little birds with a central
rosette, could be a possible depiction of Venus in conjunction with the Pleiades.29 (Fig.56)
Comparing with the sky maps, we can try to individuate tentatively the representations in
St. Mark. We’ll assume that St.Mark’s sculptor has respected the ascensional disposition
of the star cluster, which spirals upwards in the shape of a reversed
interrogation mark, with Maia in the highest position, Merope nearest to Vulpecula, and
the two ‘parents’ Pleione and Atlas as a double point (instead of just one) at the base of the
interrogation mark.
Though we have figures of boys here, we’ll have to use the female Greek names of the seven
sisters, by which the stars are known to this day.

!50
In St. Mark, we count nine figures in this group, which is consistent; even if some
uncertainty involves the number of the Pleiades in the classical myths. In most cases, the
ancient reported seven; for the Greeks, they were nine, counting the two stars who sit in pair
a little secluded from the main group, and that they saw as Atlas and Pleione, the' parents'
of the Pleiades.
It seems, however, that about the time of the Trojan War, something unexpected happened
in the skies. One of the seven main stars disappeared, and only six remained. The
phenomenon was registered with perplexity by the ancient sources. Modern science
interprets it as the possibility that one of the seven Pleiades visible in the ancient times was a
nova, which at one point disappeared.

Fig. 55 St.Mark’s Pleiades: Merope(?) with the symbol of the vernal point
Moreover, the celestial ‘cluster’ of the Pleiades is not even really that; the single stars are
actually placed several thousand light-years apart, though they appear optically very near.
What unites the members of the celestial group, contributing to its charm, it is
that their light reaches us through dense 'veils' of interstellar dust billowing in
various shapes. These ‘veils’ have sparked the observers’ imagination across the centuries
and civilizations. The Pleiad that appears lower than all the others, and more densely
wrapped, is, according to the Greek myth, Merope. The Greek thought she was ashamed;
maybe, they said, because she was less beautiful than the others, or because she was the only
one of the sisters to have married a mortal, Tantalus, while all the other had been favorite
of Gods, and given birth to semidivine children. The pain expressed by this figure on
his knees, with his/her head reclining on the shoulder, and the face (seen from
ground level) partly covered by the leaf, it is not difficult to notice in the Venetian bas
relief. (Fig.55). Another leaf, which has broken, originally covered the other half of his/her
body, producing the caracteristic “bat” shape of the stellar dust that wraps this star in the
sky.
At our Merope’s neck, not visible from the ground, but revealed by photographs, hangs a
pendant, which shows a carachteristic symbol: the Greek letter gamma, symbol of the
vernal point or spring equinox. This hidden detail, not only makes sense from an
astronomical point of view, but conforts us in thinking that the whole St.Mark’s main portal
cycle was meant to have an astronomic content: no point, otherwise, to put it there.

Right next to the mournful Merope, the Greeks saw the most beautiful and resplendent of
the sisters, Alcyone. Alcyone is actually a multiple star; three tiny little dots which outline
the head and beak of the bird seen by the ancient mythographers, at the edge of a large
semicircle which was seen as the wings: a pretty creature who has ruffled a bit its feathers
and bent its head to one side. The master of St. Mark’s arch has represented
here not one but two children, with their heads one near the other, in the
act of transporting, bending and breaking a sprout of the raceme.
Also next to Merope, but on the opposite side in the sky maps, we find Electra, to which
the veils of cosmic dust and some dots of minor stars give the characteristic shape of a
bright comma in the nightly sky.
Individuable by their characteristic hand-holding attitude, as they help each other to climb
to the summit, are Asterope and Taigeta.
In the highest position, as mentioned above, it is likely that we are seeing the brilliant
Maia, possibly with the Pleiad that the Greeks called Coeleno as the tip
of her arrow. The veils of interstellar dust outline by the real Maia in the sky, form a
kind of bow, which appears adorned with chains of tiny stars.
For its proximity to the Eagles, on the other hand, the Archer’s figure in St. Mark’s cycle
could be approached just as easily to what in the modern celestial atlases is the constellation
Sagitta, the Arrow. Sagitta is sometimes represented in the sky as an isolated arrow; in
some cases, as an arrow held in the claws of Altair, the Rising Eagle (Fig.9). Other
times, it is integrated by the figure of a youthful archer.
The ancient celestial maps identify sometimes this young archer with Arctias the hunter,
the son of Callisto, who was taken to heaven by Jupiter before he could shoot, unwittingly, a
fatal arrow against his mother transformed into a bear. Other times, the Archer raised to
heaven by the Eagle was identified with Ganimedes, a favorite of Zeus; later also with
Antinous, deified after his mysterious self-immolation in the waters of the Nile in favor of

18. Lower left archivolt: Gemini and Orion
On the same side of the archivolt, descending, we find a roundel in which are two children.
One of them, equipped with an ax, seems to attack the other, who reacts raising his arms.
The belligerent one is seen from the front, the other from behind. Their legs intersect and
overlap from the knee down, even if they don’t merge to form a Siamese pair, as it happens
in some visualization of this ancient constellation. (Figg.58, 59) Because of their location in
the celestial sphere that is emerging in St. Mark, the two children may be considered as a
representation of the zodiacal Gemini, another spring constellation located near Taurus.
Castor and Pollux, the two famous zodiacal brothers, are also known as ‘The Big Twins’, to
distinguish them from another couple of 'twins' in the stars, the so-called 'Little Twins’
located not far away in the head of Orion (see below). (Fig.57)
Returning to the Zodiac 'Big Twins', we observe that in St. Mark, contrary to the harmony
and symmetry that characterizes in general (but not always) the representation of the couple,
we see here a scene of conflict: one of the two seems poised to strike the other, who flees
away scared; the scene has induced the interpreters to think of Cain and Abel, the brothers
enemies of biblical history.
The representation in St. Mark stresses the different character of the twins, one belligerent,
and one mild, as Homer says in his Hymn to Castor and Pollux:
"But now, wild-eyed Muse, sing of Gemini! The mild innocent Pollux, and Castor tamer of wild horses:
these are heirs of fame, forces that save the mortal children of the earth!"30
The southern part of the constellation Gemini lies on the path of the Milky Way, with α
Gemini (Castor) and β (Pollux) delineating the heads of the two figures between Cancer and
Auriga; they become particularly evident in the April sky, above Orion at sunset.
19.“The Little Twins”
Lower down past the Big Twins, below the node, a pair of birds peck the leaves of the
raceme; further down, another pair of children are represented symmetrically at the sides
of the branch. One is seen in frontal pose, one at the back; the one at the left of the viewer
raises his short tunic to reveal his bare legs and the male sex. Even the companion looks like

to be a male, but it is impossible to assert this with certainty, because he is fully covered by
the tunic, and seen from behind; he just turns his face in profile towards the brother.31
Because of the position that this group occupies in the composition, we suggest
to identify these figures with the so-called 'Small Twins' in the head of Orion
constellation, known as Heka and Hika (corruption of Al Haḳ'ah, “the white
patch").32
It is a group of some small inconspicuous stars, now almost invisible to the naked eye, but
which were very important in all ancient traditions; perhaps, as Allen noted, because here in
4500 BC the winter solstice fell here; λ Orionis (Meissa), and the double star φ1 and
φ2, formed together the lunar Babylonian station Mas-tab-ba-tur-tur, "The Little
Twins".
Still much later, in the medieval Persian tradition, these little stars were seen as Ikhma, the
Twins; in Coptic Egypt, they were instead Klusos, "The Rainy".
These same tiny stars were the third Arabic manzil (lunar house), and the Indian
lunar house Mriga Ciras, or Mriga-çirsha (Margashīrsha/Mrigashira), the
"Head of the Deer".
The latter name connects the 'Little Twins' with the adjacent representation in the intrados,
already described: the deer bitten by the lion.
20. Top Right: Arcturus and the 'Woman in chains'
A concatenation of four characters holds together the different representations on the right
half of the archivolt. From below upwards, we find a child, a mature authoritative man, a
young man with a mace on his shoulder, a veiled mature woman with a jug hanging on her
side, and a younger woman. (Fig.63)
If the reconstruction so far attempted has a sense, it is reasonable to try to connect these
figures with the autumn constellations. The interactions depicted on this side of the
archivolt seem to describe the relationship between Boötes and Virgo, the most typical
autumn constellations in our hemisphere, the ascent and culmination of which on St.
Mark’s arch is shown as opposite and symmetrical to that of the Pleiades.
The situation here is clarified by the Vedic astrologyical tradition, which gives a possible
explanation of the carachters and gestures shown here.

I believe that the two male adult characters can refer to the constellation Boötes, the
heavenly 'shepherd' of the Bears. Its main star Arcturus (α Boötis), fourth brighter
star, in order of magnitude, of the whole firmament, is defined in Vedic texts
'He who walks briskly'; or even Nishtya, 'The Outcast' (perhaps because of its
secluded location, far outside the range of the Zodiac); which resonates with the contents of
the middle circle, where the young, with a staff/mace on his shoulder, seems to
walk at a good pace, while the other character, a mature man, points his finger,
as to show him the way. (Figg.60,61,62)
The alignment formed by the arm and the index of the mature man with the mace that the
young carries on the shoulder is indicative: in the constellation Boötes, the stars
Alkaurops, Princeps and a number of other minor form a long straight alignment,
which was interpreted by ancient astronomers as the spear / pastoral staff at
Boötes’ side.
In the next circle, with veiled head and a jug at her belt, the autumn constellation
Virgo appears with her daughter to donate the wheat harvest to mankind, and to make the
humans happy with the gift of wine.
But then, in the next roundel, Arcturus, armed with a whip of ropes, drives away this
benevole star; with her pitcher hanging at her side, her hands tied behind her back, she
walks away; we see her veiled head from behind, as she disappears. (Fig. 64,65)
This characterization relates us to the Islamic world, where the biggest star of Virgo, Spica,
is called both Azimech, ال##سماك الأع##زل from Arabic al-Simak al-a'zal, 'the Helpless',
and Alarph, 'the (she-)Harvester’.
The star 38 Boötis, or h Boötis, has the traditional name of Merga, sometimes in the
variant Marrha or, in full, El Mara e Musalsela, from the arabic الم###رأة المس###لسلة , al-mar'ah-al
musalsalah "the tied woman".
34
Another name in the Latin tradition for the star in the raised hand of Boötes is Falx
Italica; the ancient saw here a sickle, that Boötes raises to warn that the time of the
harvest has come. As to the whip of which Arcturus, as here, is sometimes armed, it was
seen as the leash, made of many cords, with which Boötes incites the celestial Hunting
Dogs (Canes Venatici, another nearby constellation) to pursue the two polar bears which lie
in the adjacent area, and which rotate in perpetuity, moving in front of him, around the top
of the sky.
34 Merga, sometimes called Marrha, or “El Mara el Musalsela”, from the Arabic المرأة المسلسلة al-mar’ah al
musalsalah, “la donna incatenata". Another designation is Falx Italica, from the latin “sickle (for harvest)“. Allen, Star Names cit., Merga, p. 106, http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Merga.html, Retr. 25/03/2015

The man (Arcturus) who casts away the defenseless woman with her pitcher on the side
(Spica), and the tail of the Zodiacal Lion (Denebola), lying together in a circle of the
highest section of the right archivolt, in the vicinity of the polar Bears, forms another
characteristic triangular asterism, well known to travelers: the so-called ‘spring
triangle’ (from the season in which it is better discernible).
Even the placement of these high figures says something: the Arabs knew Arcturus as Al
Simak al-Ramih; this word, Simak, comes from a root meaning "to lift up," used by the
Arabs when they wanted to indicate a significant object in an elevated position in the sphere
of the heavens, but was used with particular reference precisely to this star, and another
Simak, Spica of the Virgo.
Simak is sometimes translated as "the leg of the Spear Bearer", or, perhaps more correctly,
the Noble, the High, the Exalted. Other names referring to Arcturus (taken fotr the entire
constellation Boötes, are "Kontaratos", bearer of javelin, Gladius, Kolanza (Italian: “with a
lance”), and Pugio (Italian:“with a staff ”, or “support”). The Arabic name has given origin to
different degenerate forms: Arámec, Aramec, Aremeah, Ascimec, Azimech, and Azimeth,
which are found in various compendia of Western stellar nomenclature, including the Tavole
Alfonsine and the Almagest of 1515.35
21. Virgo
For the Greeks, the heliacal rise of Arcturus coincided with the time of the grapes harvest:
"But when Orion and Sirius have come to the middle of their course, and the rosy-fingered Aurora sees
Arcturus, then harvest all your clusters, Perses, and bring them home," wrote Hesiod in The Works and
Days.
As for the Virgin, since very ancient times a female figure was seen as the preeminent
constellation in the autumn sky. Her appearance, synchronic with the maturation of the
crops, is often accompanied by that of a ‘daughter’ carachter (as in the Latin group Ceres/
Proserpina); common to different traditions are: her veiled head (due to the fact that the
head of the constellation is a group of minuscule and not very visible stars), and that by her
waist shines the beautiful and bright "daughter" star (α Virginis). For the Latins, this was
Spica, the "ear of wheat", but according to other traditions, sometimes seen as a vase
or cornucopia. (Figg. 67, 68) In St. Mark’s relief, the figure is veiled, has a vase at her
girdle, and introduces a younger female figure who distributes wine to the happy humans.

22. Right lower-middle section of the archivolt: Aesculapius, the dwarf and the snake
It is still a matter of debate if the mysterious Asclepius, the physician capable of restore life
to the point of arousing the jealousy of Jupiter, may have something in common with the
Ophiuchus/Serpentarius of the Zodiac.
Hyginus saw in them one figure: the miraculous healer/physician and the celestial
Serpentarius of the winter solstice had in common the ability of "taming" the snakes, and to
‘invert’ the course of a cycle: from winter to summer, from sickness to health, from death to
life.
Asclepius had a recognized female counterpart, his daughter and pupil Hygieia. In a
rare Roman ivory diptych of the Late Antiquity, Asclepius appears with Hygieia, who

23. To a provisional conclusion: the possible general scheme of St. Mark’s cycle
Going back to the two Eagles, the couple of stars we observed at first, we remarked that they
form the basis of a well-known asterism, the ‘Summer triangle’. We observed also that the
base of this triangle hints to an invisible point, that would form its upper vertex.
This sublime invisible star would be Deneb, the α of the constellation Cygnus the
Swan.The celestial bird was visualized by the ancient astronomers head below, plunging
from the sky toward the earth. Cygnus was also called, for its shape, the Northern Cross; its
main stars are: the white and very bright little Albireo, located in the head, and the orange
big Deneb, towards the tail.
Suggested by the location of the two Eagles, and ideally projected on St. Mark’s facade, the
constellation of Cygnus would convey a striking suggestion: the white bright Albireo in the
head of the bird would fall where once was the Christ Child in the sculptural Nativity that
inherited from him the secrets of the art of medicine, and is often depicted, as here, in the
act of feeding a snake. (Fig.26) At the foot of each figure, another child of Asclepius, the
mysterious little kid (or dwarf) Telesphoros, is represented twice.
Of this little deity, not much is known, except that he was considered a messenger of
healing, a herald of revival. He appeared at the foot of his father holding a scroll, and read
his prediction for the patient that Asclepius was visiting. The few representations known
show Telesphoros wrapped in a sort of pod, with a curious cone-shaped hood on his
head.
On the left valve of this diptych, near Asclepius with his rolled-up scroll in the hand, the
little creature has his best known symbolic attributes: wrapped in his hooded cape as in a
sort of pod, he is reading the scroll of prophecy. Near Hygieia, on the right valve, he
appears naked, accompanied by a dog, and holding a tool that remembers for his shape the
mysterious ancient khopesh, a symbolic divination weapon of the Egyptian tradition. With
these attributes, Telesphoros reminds us of Harpocrates, the Egyptian Horus child, son of
Isis, with whom he seems to share many elements.
In St. Mark’s arch, a child holding a mysterious object in his hand (it looks like a tiny snake
coiled, ready to stand on end), shows/announces something to the adult with a rolled scroll
in his hand, who in turn sends Arcturus on his way. These two carachters, The older man
and the child, located in proximity of the “man of snakes”/Ophiucus and his female
equivalent, draw attention towards a possible connection.
However, these carachters refer to an area still not enough enlightened by iconographic
research, which awaits further illumination.

originally adorned the portal. The group, including the Virgin and Child, St. Joseph, and the
Magi, was possibly located on the still visible, but now empty, steps above the arch.
The big orange Deneb, α Cygni, would have been higher, maybe in the Christ in glory
represented in the mosaic, today not extant, above the portal.36
The Northern Cross, which from its location at the North celestial pole seems to plunge with
a mysterious rush toward the earth, thus creates an allegory of Redemption, of the act of

love that brought God from the depth of the heavens to its visible manifestation in the world
of man. Given the constant references to climate and rains in this St. Mark’s calendar, one
could also ask, as a suggestion for a possible further inquiry, if the plan of the entire decoration
could not be in relation with the mystic invocation for celestial showers in the famous hymn by
the prophet Isaiah: “Rorate Coeli desuper”.
Present in the Gregorian Hymnal, this hymn is the Introitus to the Mass for the fourth Sunday
of Advent, and is in the common for the Holy Virgin Mary.
It opens with the following invocation:
Rorate coeli desuper et nubes pluant justum
(Drop down dew, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain the Just)
Aperiatur terra, et germinet salvatorem"
(Let the earth open, and send forth the Saviour” (Isaiah 45, 8)
The responsorial consists of the first verses of Psalm 18 ( 19 ) , known as the Hymn to God the
Creator :
The Heavens tell the glory of God,
the work of his hand announces the firmament. (Psalm 19, 1)
The text of the Psalm continues evoking the admirable order of the cosmos as a manifestation
of the glory of God, a perfect commentary to the sequence of wonders presented in this stone
calendar :
The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.
They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them.
Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.
In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.
It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
like a champion rejoicing to run his course.



!68
His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults.
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.37

Note
In the celestial globes, the stars and constellations are mostly represented as seen by an observer located outside, in the deep space; because of this, it is sometimes convenient to reverse these images specularly, to make them more comparable with other kinds of celestial maps that put the observer on the Earth.
