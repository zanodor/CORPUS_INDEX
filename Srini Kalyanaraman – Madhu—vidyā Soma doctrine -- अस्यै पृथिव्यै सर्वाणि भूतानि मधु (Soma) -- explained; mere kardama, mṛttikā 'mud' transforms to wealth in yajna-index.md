"That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite. the infinite proceeds from the infinite.(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe), it remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone." (Translation by Swami Madhavananda The Brhadaranyaka Upanisad with commentary of Sankaracarya. Advaita Ashrama. The Peace Chant) "From infinite or fullness, we can get only fullness or infinite". The above verse describes the nature of the Absolute or Brahman which is infinite or full, i.e., it contains everything. Upanishadic metaphysics is further elucidated in the Madhu-vidya (honey doctrine), where the essence of every object is described to be same to the essence of every other object. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad looks at reality as being indescribable and its nature to be infinite and consciousness-bliss. The cosmic energy is thought to integrate in the microcosm and in the macrocosm integrate the individual to the universe.

SIXTEENTH KHANDA
A person's entire life symbolically a Soma-sacrifice
1. Veiily, a person is a sacrifice. His [first] twenty-fouryears are the morning Somalibation, for the Gayatri meterhas twenty-four syllables and the morning Somalibation isoffered with a Gayatri hymn. The Vasus are connected withthis part of the sacrifice. Verily, the vital breaths (prdnd) arethe Vasus, for they cause everything here to continue (Vvas).
2. If any sickness should overtake him in this period of life,let him say :
' Ye vital breaths, ye Vasus, let this morninglibation of mine continue over to the mid-day libation. Letnot me, the sacrifice, be broken off in the midst of the vitalbreaths, of the Vasus.' He arises from it; he becomes freefrom sickness.



6
3. Now the [next] forty-four years are the mid-day libation,
Madhu kānda (the 4th and 5th chapter of the fourteenth kānda of Satapatha Brahmana)
FOURTH BRÂHMANA.
14:1:4:11. Now, when the Adhvaryu here steps up and says, 'The Gharma is aglow,' they step up and revere it (the Mahâvîra) with the Avakâsa 1; but the 'avakâsa' are the vital airs: it is thus the vital airs he lays into it. Six of them 2 step up to it, for six in number are these vital airs in the head: it is these he thus lays into it.
14:1:4:22. [Vâg. S. XXXVII, 14,] 'The child of the gods,'--the child (garbha) of the gods, in truth, is he that shines yonder, for he holds (grabh) everything here, and by him everything here is held; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'The child of the gods.'
14:1:4:33. 'The father of thoughts,'--for he (the sun) is indeed the father of thoughts;--'the lord of creatures,'--for he is indeed the lord of creatures.
14:1:4:44. 'The god hath united with the god Savitri,'--for the god (the Mahâvîra) has indeed united with the god Savitri (the sun);--'with Sûrya he shineth,'--for (equally) with Sûrya (the sun) he has indeed shone.
14:1:4:55. [Vâg. S. XXXVII, 15,] 'Agni hath united with Agni,'--for Agni (fire) has indeed united with Agni;--'with the divine Savitri,'--for with the divine Savitri he has indeed united;-'with Sûrya
p. 470
he hath shone,'--for with Sûrya he has indeed shone.
14:1:4:66. 'Hail! Agni hath united with his heat,'--for Agni has indeed united with his heat; the call of hail he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before;--'with the divine Savitri,'--for with the divine Savitri he has indeed united;--'with Sûrya he hath shed light,'--for with Sûrya he has indeed shed light.
14:1:4:77. These, then, are three 'avakâsa,'--for there are three vital airs, the in (and out)breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is thereby that he lays it (the vital air) into him.
14:1:4:88. [Vâg. S. XXXVII, 16,] 'The sustainer of the sky, and of heat upon earth, shineth forth,'--for as the sustainer of the sky, and of heat on earth, that (sun, and Mahâvîra) indeed shines forth;--'the divine sustainer of the gods, he, the immortal, born of heat,'--for he is indeed the divine sustainer of the gods, the immortal one, born of heat;--'grant unto us speech, devoted to the gods!'--speech doubtless is worship: he thus means to say thereby, 'bestow upon us worship whereby we shall please the gods!'
14:1:4:99. [Vâg. S. XXXVII, 17; Rig-v. I, 164, 31; X, 177, 3,] 'I beheld the guardian, the never-resting 1,'--he who shines yonder is indeed the guardian, for he guards everything here; and he does not lie down to rest: therefore he says, 'I beheld the guardian, the never-resting;'-



7
p. 471
14:1:4:1010, 'Wandering on paths hither and thither,'--for he indeed wanders hither and thither on the divine 1 paths;--'arraying himself in the gathering and the radiating,'--for he indeed arrays himself in the gathering (converging) and the radiating regions, or rays;--'he moveth to and fro within the spheres,'--for again and again he wanders moving within these worlds.
14:1:4:1111. [Vâg. S. XXXVII, 18,] 'O lord of all worlds, O lord of all thought, O lord of all speech, O lord of every speech!' that is, 'O lord of all this (universe);'--'Thou art heard by the gods, O god Gharma, as a god, guard thou the gods!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.
14:1:4:1212. 'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine feast of you two,'--it is with regard to the two Asvins that he says this, for it was the Asvins that then restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine feast of you two.'
14:1:4:1313. 'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing for honey!'--for Dadhyañk the Âtharvana indeed told them (the Asvins) the Brâhmana called Madhu (honey), and this is their dear resource: it is by means of that (dear resource) of theirs that he approaches them, and therefore he says, 'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing for honey!'
14:1:4:1414. [Vâg. S. XXXVII, 19,] 'To the heart
p. 472
[paragraph continues](I consecrate) thee, to the mind thee, to the sky thee, to the sun thee: going upwards take thou the sacrifice to the gods in heaven!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.
14:1:4:1515. [Vâg. S. XXXVII, 20,] 'Thou art our father: be thou our father!'--for he who shines yonder is indeed the father, and the Pravargya is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Thou art our father: be thou our father!'--'Reverence be unto thee: injure me not!'--it is a blessing he thereby invokes.
14:1:4:1616. Thereupon he uncovers the head of the (Sacrificer's) wife, and makes her say whilst she is looking at the Mahâvîra, 'Together with Tvashtri will we serve thee: (bestow thou sons and cattle upon me! bestow thou offspring upon us! may I remain unscathed together with my husband!)'--the Pravargya (m.) is a male, and the wife is a female: a productive pair is thus produced.
14:1:4:1717. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation 1.

[quote]Brihadaranyaka literally means "great wilderness or forest". The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is credited to ancient sage Yajnavalkya, but likely refined by a number of ancient



8
Vedic scholars. The Upanishad forms the last part, that is the fourteenth kānda of Śatapatha Brāhmana of "Śhukla Yajurveda". The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has six adhyayas (chapters) in total. There are two major recensions for the text - the Madhyandina and the Kanva recensions. It includes three sections: Madhu kānda (the 4th and 5th chapter of the fourteenth kānda of Satapatha Brahmana), Muni kānda (or Yajnavalkya Kanda, the 6th and 7th chapter of 14th kānda of Satapatha Brahmana) and Khila kānda (the 8th and 9th chapter of the fourteenth kānda of Satapatha Brahmana).The first and second chapters of the Upanishad's Madhu kānda consists of six brahmanas each, with varying number of hymns per brahmana...The fifth brahmana of the second chapter of बृहदवरण्यकोपथिषत् introduces the Madhu theory, thus giving this section of the Upanishad the ancient name Madhu Khanda. The Madhu theory is one of the foundational principles of Vedanta schools of Hinduism, as well as other āstika schools of Indian philosophies. Madhu literally means "honey", or the composite fruit of numerous actions on the field of flowers. ...The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad asserts that "Atman exists" (soul exists), that all organic beings (plants, animals, human beings and gods) are wandering souls yet One with each other and the Brahman (Cosmic Soul); it further asserts that inorganic nature (fire, air, earth, water, space) is the field where the beings act, and where their numerous actions create fruits that they separately and together experience. The Upanishad then states that everything is connected, beings affect each other, organic beings affect the inorganic nature, inorganic nature affects the organic beings, one is the "honey" (result, fruit, food) of the other, everyone and everything is mutually dependent, nourishing and nurturing each other, all because it came from one Brahman, because it is all one Brahman, because all existence is blissful oneness.[unquote]

19* This, verily, is the honey which Dadhyanc Atharvanadeclared unto the two Asvins. Seeing this, the seer spake :
1 RV i. 1 1 6. 12. The two Asvins desired instruction from Dadhyanc. Butthe latter was loath to impart it, for Indra had threatened Dadhyanc that if he ever told this honey-doctrine to any one else, he (India) would cut his head off.To avoid this untoward result, the Asvins took off Dadhyanc's head and substituteda horse's head. Then, after Dadhyanc had declared the honey-doctrine m compliancewith their request and Indra had carried out his threat, the Asvins restoredto Dadhyanc his own head. This episode shows the extreme difficulty with whicheven gods secured the knowledge originally possessed by Indra.

This is to be looked upon as a form of him. RV 6.47.18

Third Prapāṭhaka
Brahman is the sun of all existence, Madhu Vidya
The Chandogya Upanishad presents the Madhu Vidya (honey knowledge) in first eleven volumes of the third chapter. Sun is praised as source of all light and life, and stated as worthy of meditation in a symbolic representation of Sun as "honey" of all Vedas The Brahman is stated in these volume of verses to be the sun of the universe, and the 'natural sun' is a phenomenal manifestation of the Brahman, states Paul Deussen
The simile of "honey" is extensively developed, with Vedas, the Itihasa and mythological stories, and the Upanishads are described as flowers The Rig hymns, the Yajur maxims, the Sama songs, the Atharva verses and deeper, secret doctrines of Upanishads are represented as the vehicles of rasa (nectar), that is the bees. The nectar itself is described as "essence of knowledge, strength, vigor, health, renown, splendor" The Sun is described as the honeycomb laden with glowing light of honey. The rising and setting of the sun is likened to man's cyclic state of clarity and confusion, while the spiritual state of knowing Upanishadic insight of Brahman is described by Chandogya Upanishad as being one with Sun, a state of permanent day of perfect knowledge, the day which knows no night

Wilson translation: 6.047.18 Indra, the prototype, has assumed various forms, and such is his form as that which (he adopts) for his manifestation; Indra, multiform by his illusion, proceeds (to his many worshippers), for the horses, yoked to his car are a thousand. [Indra has assumed: Indra presents himself as Agni, Vis.n.u, or Rudra, or any other deity who is the actual object of worship, and is really the deity tobe adored; he is identifiable with each; Horses yoked: Indra's chariots and horses are multiplied according to the forms in which he manifests himself; Indra is here identified with Parames'vara, the supreme first cause, identical with creation]. 6.047.19 Yoking his horses to his car, Tvas.t.a_ shines in many places here in the three worlds; who (else), sojourning daily among his present worshippers, is their proector against adversaries? [In this r.ca,Tvas.t.a_ is an appellative of Indra, the ancient artificer!].
