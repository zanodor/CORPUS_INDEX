This is one side of the original obelisk, which
stands two metres tall and has four sides, each
with 5 picture panels interspersed with
cuneiform inscriptions. There is also cuneiform
above and below each set of pictures. The
inscriptions record the annals of thirty-two years
of the reign of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III
(r. 858-824 BC). Most of the illustrations record
the tributes brought to Shalmaneser by various
vassal kings. This panel: plaster replica; black
alabaster original. Height 112 cm, width 55.5
cm, depth 5.5 cm.

The top panel of the replica shows Sua, the Gilzanite, bringing
tribute to Shalmaneser, who is standing to the left, armed with a
bow and arrows and accompanied by an attendant and soldier.
Above this scene are the winged sun-disc, divine symbol of the god
Assur, king of all of the great gods, and the eight-pointed star,
divine symbol of Enlil, creator and father of the gods.
The second panel, which is possibly the most significant, depicts
Shalmaneser receiving tribute from Jehu, king of Israel, who is
prostrate before the king. Shalmaneser holds a bowl in his raised
hand and is sheltered by a parasol held by an attendant.
The tribute of the country of Musri, illustrated on the third panel,
consists entirely of animals led or driven by attendants dressed in
knee-length garments.
The fourth panel illustrates two lions hunting a stag in a forest,
perhaps reminiscent of the countries which Shalmaneser has
conquered.
The bottom panel records the tribute of Karparunda of Hattina,
brought forth by porters wearing pointed caps.

Black Obelisk of Shalamaneser III, 823 BCE-3
The tribute of the country of Musri, illustrated on the third panel, consists entirely of animals
led or driven by attendants dressed in knee-length garments. Details of third panel in four
registers A,B,C,D.
•Side A: Attendants bring "tribute from Muṣri: two-humped camels". Muṣri,
meaning 'borderland', probably refers to a country far to the east.
•Side B: Exotic animals from Muṣri: "a river-ox [water-buffalo], an [Indian]
rhinoceros (and) an antelope". The sculptor seems never to have seen a
rhinoceros or water-buffalo.(The sculptor seems to call 'unicorn' a rhinoceros;
and a water-buffalo as river-ox).The sculptor shows unique horns of an
antelope showing a winding, curved, U-shaped serpent with two cobra-hoods.
•Side C: "Female [Indian] elephants, female monkeys (and) apes" from
Muṣri.
•Side D: More "monkeys" and their keepers from Muṣri. The way the
monkeys are carved suggests... monkeys were not new sights for the Assyrian
court at this time.

Panel 3 on the obelisk lists tributes from Musri. Muṣri, meaning
'borderland', probably refers to a country far to the east -- perhaps
from Hindanu province (which is east of the Musasir mountains) or
further east from Meluhha.
Alternative. Musri (Assyrian: Mu-us-ri), or Muzri, was a small
ancient kingdom, in northern areas of Iraqi Kurdistan. The area is
now inhabited by Muzuri (Mussouri) Kurds.

Indus Script cipher and decipherment provide the
explanation; the monkeys and other animals are
hieroglyphs (signifiers) which signify Meluhha rebus
readings of specific wealth resources (signified) produced
by Meluhha artisans and settlers of Musri (Muzuri,
Mussouri Kurds), north Kurdistan. Evidence of Meluhha
settlers in borderland Mari is well attested by the
procession which carries the 'unicorn' on flagstaff.
How can four monkeys and other animals
constitute tributes to Shalamaneser III?
