SOME
ACCOUNT
OF THE
LIFE AND WRITINGS
OF
JACOB BRYANT, ESQ.
The earliest authentic account we can obtain of the birth of this learned and celebrated writer, is from the Register Book of Eton College, in which he is entered "of Chatham, in the county of Kent, of the age of twelve years, in 1730,"—consequently, born in 1718.
Whence a difference has arisen between the dates in this entry, and the inscription on his monument, hereafter given, we are unable to explain.
The two royal foundations of Eton, and King's College, Cambridge, justly boast of this great scholar and ornament of his age. He received his first rudiments at the village of Lullingstone, in Kent; and was admitted upon the foundation, at Eton College, on the 3d of August, 1730, where he was three years captain of the school, previous to his removal to Cambridge. He was elected from Eton to King's College in 1736; took the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1740; and proceeded Master in 1744.
He attended the Duke of Marlborough, and his brother, Lord Charles Spencer, at Eton, as their private tutor, and proved a valuable acquisition to that illustrious house; and, what may be reckoned, at least equally fortunate, his lot fell among those who knew how to appreciate his



worth, and were both able and willing to reward it. The Duke made him his private secretary, in which capacity he accompanied his Grace during his campaign on the continent, where he had the command of the British forces; and, when he was made Master-General of the Ordnance, he appointed Mr. Bryant to the office of Secretary, then about 1400l. per annum.
His general habits, in his latter years, as is commonly the case with severe students, were sedentary; and, during the last ten years of his life, he had frequent pains in his chest, occasioned by so much application, and leaning against his table to write; but, in his younger days, spent at Eton, he excelled in various athletic exercises; and, by his skill in swimming, was the happy instrument in saving the life of the venerable Dr. Barnard, afterwards Provost of Eton College. The doctor gratefully acknowledged this essential service, by embracing the first opportunity which occurred, to present the nephew of his preserver with the living of Wootton Courtney, near Minehead, in Somerset; a presentation belonging to the Provost of Eton, in right of his office.
Mr. Bryant was never married. He commonly rose at half past seven, shaved himself without a glass, was seldom a quarter of an hour in dressing, at nine rung for his breakfast, which was abstemious, and generally visited his friends at Eton and Windsor, between breakfast and dinner, which was formerly at two, but afterwards at four o'clock. He was particularly fond of dogs, and was known to have thirteen spaniels at one time: he once very narrowly escaped drowning, through his over eagerness in putting them into the water.
Our author must be considered as highly distinguished, beyond the common lot of mortality, with the temporal blessings of comforts, honour, and long life. With respect to the first of these, he enjoyed health, peace, and competence; for, besides what he derived from his own family, the present Duke of Marlborough, after his father's death, settled an annuity on Mr. Bryant of 600 l. which he continued to receive from that noble family till his death.
He was greatly honoured among his numerous, yet chosen friends and acquaintance; and his company courted by all the literary characters in his neighbourhood. His more particular intimates, in his own district, were Doctors Barford, Barnard, Glynn, and Heberden. The venerable Sir George Baker, he either saw or corresponded with every day; likewise with Dr. Hallam, the father of Eton school, who had given up the deanery of Bristol, because he chose to reside at Windsor. When he went into Kent, the friends he usually visited were the Reverend Archdeacon Law, Mr. Longley, Recorder of Rochester, and Dr. Dampier, afterwards Bishop of that diocese. Besides the pecuniary expression of esteem mentioned above, the Duke of Marlborough had two rooms kept for him at Blenheim, with his name inscribed over the doors; and he was the only person who was presented with the keys of that choice library. The humble retreat of the venerable sage was frequently visited by his Majesty; and thus he partook in the highest honours recorded of the philosophers and sages of antiquity. Thus loved and honoured, he attained to eighty-nine years of age, and died, at Cypenham, near Windsor, Nov. 13, 1804, of a mortification in his leg, originating in the seemingly slight circumstance of a rasure against a chair, in the act of reaching a book from a shelf.
He had presented many of his most valuable books to the King in his life-time, and his editions by Caxton to the Marquis of Blandford: the remainder of this choice collection he bequeathed to the library of King's College, Cambridge, where he had received his education.
He gave, by will, 2,000 l. to the society for propagating the gospel, and 1,000 l. to the superannuated collegers of Eton school, to be disposed of as the provost and fellows should think fit. Also, 500 l. to the parish of Farnham Royal. The poor of Cypenham and Chalvey were constant partakers of his bounty, which was of so extensive a nature, that he commissioned the neighbouring clergy to look out proper objects for his beneficence.
Mr. Bryant's literary attainments were of a nature peculiar to himself; and, in point of classical erudition he was, perhaps, without an equal in the world. He had the very peculiar felicity of preserving his eminent superiority of talents to the end of a very long life; the whole of which was not only devoted to literature, but his studies were uniformly directed to the investigation of truth. The love of truth might, indeed, be considered as his grand characteristic, which he steadily pursued; and this is equally true as to his motive, whether he was found on the wrong or right side of the question. A few minutes before he expired, he declared to his nephew, and others in the room, that "all he had written was with a view to the promulgation of truth; and, that all he had contended for, he himself believed." By truth, we are to understand religious truth, his firm persuasion of the truth of Christianity; to the investigation and establishment of which he devoted his whole life. This was the central point, around which all his labours turned; the ultimate object at which they aimed.



Such are the particulars we have been able to collect of this profound scholar and antiquary. But the life of a man of letters appears, and must be chiefly sought for in his works, of which we subjoin the following catalogue:
The first work Mr. Bryant published was in 1767, intituled, "Observations and Inquiries relating to various Parts of antient History; containing Dissertations on the Wind Euroclydon, (see vol. v. p. 325.); and on the Island Melite, (see vol. v. p. 357.), together with an Account of Egypt in its most early State, (see vol. vi. p. 1.); and of the Shepherd Kings." (See vol. vi. p. 105.) This publication is calculated not only to throw light on the antient history of the kingdom of Egypt, but on the history also of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Babylonians, Edomites, and other nations. The account of the Shepherd Kings contains a statement of the time of their coming into Egypt; of the particular province they possessed, and, to which the Israelites afterwards succeeded. The treatise on the Euroclydon was designed to vindicate the common reading of Acts, xxvii. 14. in opposition to Bochart, Grotius, and Bentley, supported by the authority of the Alexandrine M.S. and the Vulgate, who thought EUROAQUILO more agreeable to the truth.
His grand work, called, "A New System, or, an Analysis of Antient Mythology," was the next; "wherein an attempt is made to divest Tradition of Fable, and to reduce Truth to its original Purity." This was published in quarto, vol. i. and ii. in 1774, and vol. iii. in 1776.
In 1775 he published "A Vindication of the Apamean Medal, (see vol. v. p. 287.) and of the Inscription ΝΩΕ; together with an Illustration of another Coin struck at the same Place in honour of the Emperor Severus." This appeared in the fourth volume of the Archæologia, and also as a separate quarto pamphlet.
"An address to Dr. Priestley, on the Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity illustrated," 1780. A pamphlet, octavo.
"Vindiciæ Flavianæ; or, a Vindication of the Testimony given by Josephus concerning our Saviour Jesus Christ." A pamphlet, octavo. 1780.
"Observations on the Poems of Thomas Rowley; in which the authenticity of these Poems is ascertained." Two duodecimo volumes, 1781. In this controversy Mr. Bryant engaged deeply and earnestly, and was assisted in it by the learned Dr. Glynn of King's College, Cambridge. Our author in this, as in his other controversial writings, was influenced by a spirit of sober inquiry, and a regard for truth. The leading object he had in view, in his Observations on the poems ascribed to Rowley, was to prove, by a variety of instances, that Chatterton could not be their author, as he appeared not to understand them himself. This plea appears specious, yet it is certain the learned author failed egregiously in his proofs, and this publication added little to the reputation he had already acquired. The best way of accounting for Mr. Bryant's risking his wellearned and high character in the literary world in this controversy, and for the eagerness with which he engaged in it, is from the turn of his studies. "He had," to borrow the words of Mr. Mason, "been much engaged in antiquities, and consequently had imbibed too much of the spirit of a protest antiquarian; now we know, from a thousand instances, that no set of men are more willingly duped than these, especially by any thing that comes to them under the fascinating form of a new discovery."
"Collections on the Zingara, or Gypsey Language." Archæologia, vol. vii.
"Gemmarum antiquarum Delectus ex præstantioribus desumptus in Dactylotheca Ducis Marlburiensis," Two vols, folio, 1783, &c. This is the first volume of the Duke of Marlborough's splendid edition of his invaluable collection of Gems, and was translated into French by Dr. Maty. The second volume was done in Latin by Dr. Cole, prebendary of Westminster; the French by Mr. Dutens. The Gems are exquisitely engraved by Bartolozzi. This work was privately printed, and no more copies taken than were intended for the crowned heads of Europe, and a few of his Grace's private friends; after which the coppers for the plates were broken, and the manuscript for the letter-press carefully reduced to ashes.
"A Treatise on the Authenticity of the Scriptures, and the Truth of the Christian Religion." Octavo, 1792.
"Observations upon the Plagues inflicted upon the Egyptians; in which is shewn the Peculiarity of those Judgments, and their Correspondence with the Rites and Idolatry of that People; with a prefatory discourse concerning the Grecian colonies from Egypt." Octavo, 1794.
The treatise on the authenticity of the Scriptures was published anonymously, and the whole of the profits arising from its sale given to the society for the Propagation of the Gospel. It contains a



good general view of the leading arguments for Divine Revelation.
"Observations upon a Treatise, intituled, Description of the Plain of Troy, by Mons Le Chevalier," Quarto, 1795.
"A Dissertation concerning the War of Troy, and the Expedition of the Grecians, as described by Homer; shewing that no such Expedition was ever undertaken, and that no such City in Phrygia ever existed." Quarto, 1796. The appearance of this publication excited great surprise among the learned, and made few proselytes to the doctrine it inculcates; and even his high authority failed in overturning opinions so long maintained and established among historians, and supported by such extensive and clear evidence. He is a wise man indeed who knows where to stop. Mr. Bryant had wonderfully succeeded in his famous Mythology, in "divesting Tradition of Fable, and reducing Truth to its original Purity," and this seduced him, as his antiquarian pursuits had done before, in the case of Rowley, to proceed to unwarrantable lengths in the Dissertation on the War of Troy. It was remarked on by Mr. Falconer, and answered in a very rude way by Mr. Gilbert Wakefield in a letter to Mr. Bryant. J. B. S. Morrit, Esq. of Rokeby Park, near Greta-Bridge, undertook to vindicate Homer, in a style and with manners more worthy of the subject and of a gentleman, and was replied to by Mr. Bryant.
"The Sentiments of Philo Judæus concerning the ΛΟΓΟΣ, or Word of God; together with large Extracts from his Writings, compared with the Scriptures, on many other essential Doctrines of the Christian Religion." Octavo, 1797.
"Dissertations on Balaam, Sampson, and Jonah," also, "Observations on famous controverted Passages in Josephus and Justin Martyr," are extremely curious, and such perhaps as only he could have written.
"The New System, or, an Analysis of Antient Mythology," here presented to the public, is a literary phenomenon, which will remain the admiration of scholars, as long as a curiosity after antiquity shall continue to be a prevailing passion among mankind. Its author was master of the profoundest erudition, and did not come behind the most distinguished names of the last century, for their attention to the minutest circumstance that might cast a ray of light upon the remotest ages. Nothing in the antient Greek and Roman literature, however recondite, or wherever dispersed, could escape his sagacity and patient investigation. But we are not to confine our admiration of the work before us to the deep erudition discoverable in it; this elaborate production is equally distinguished for its ingenuity and novelty. Departing with a boldness of genius from the systems of his predecessors in the same walks of literature, he delights by his ingenuity, while he astonishes by his courage, and surprises by his novelty. In the last point of view, this work is indeed singularly striking; it departs from the commonly-received systems, to a degree that has not only never been attempted, but not even thought of by any men of learning.
The subject, here undertaken by Mr. Bryant was one of uncommon difficulty; one of the most abstruse and difficult which antiquity presents to us; the information to be obtained concerning it must be collected from a vast number of incidental passages, observations and assertions scattered through antient authors, who being themselves but imperfectly acquainted with their subject, it is next to impossible to reconcile. This, however, our author has attempted; and though, in doing this, the exuberances of fancy and imagination are conspicuous, and some may entertain doubts, concerning the solidity of some of his conjectures, yet, even such are forced to allow that many parts of the author's scheme are probable, and deserving the highest attention.
His method of proceeding by etymology was not a little hazardous; men of the greatest abilities have often failed in the use of it, while those of weak judgment have, by their application of it, rendered it the source of the greatest absurdities, and almost led the unthinking to connect an idea of ridicule with the term itself. But the judicious use which Mr. Bryant could make of this science is apparent in every part of his work: he derives from it the greatest and only light which can be cast upon some of his inquiries, and that in a way that will draw the admiration of those who have a proper acquaintance with the subject; that is, such as have a knowledge of the Oriental languages sufficient to enable them to trace them through the Greek, Latin, and other tongues, as they relate to the names of things, which in almost every country carry evidence of their being derived from the East; from whence it is certain mankind themselves are derived. The sagacity and diligence with which our author has applied his helps obtained from the scattered passages of antient authors and etymology, have enabled him to clear up the history of the remotest ages, and to elucidate objects hitherto surrounded with darkness and error. Upon the whole, it will be



allowed by all who are capable judges of the subject, that the plausibility of his hypothesis is frequently apparent, his scheme great, and his discoveries extraordinary.

PREFACE.
Ναφε, και μεμνασ' απιστειν· αρθρα ταυτα των φρενων.——E .



It is my purpose, in the ensuing work, to give an account of the first ages, and of the great events which happened in the infancy of the world. In consequence of this I shall lay before the reader what the Gentile writers have said upon this subject, collaterally with the accounts given by Moses, as long as I find him engaged in the general history of mankind. By these means I shall be able to bring surprising proofs of those great occurrences, which the sacred penman has recorded. And when his history becomes more limited, and is confined to a peculiar people, and a private dispensation, I shall proceed to shew what was subsequent to his account after the migration of families, and the dispersion from the plains of Shinar. When mankind were multiplied upon the
earth, each great family had, by [3]divine appointment, a particular place of destination, to which they retired. In this manner the first nations were constituted, and kingdoms founded. But great changes were soon effected, and colonies went abroad without any regard to their original place of allotment. New establishments were soon made, from whence ensued a mixture of people and languages. These are events of the highest consequence; of which we can receive no intelligence, but through the hands of the Gentile writers.
It has been observed, by many of the learned, that some particular family betook themselves very early to different parts of the world, in all which they introduced their rites and religion, together with the customs of their country. They represent them as very knowing and enterprising; and with good reason. They were the first who ventured upon the seas, and undertook long voyages. They shewed their superiority and address in the numberless expeditions which they made, and the difficulties which they surmounted. Many have thought that they were colonies from Egypt, or from Phenicia, having a regard only to the settlements which they made in the west. But I shall shew hereafter, that colonies of the same people are to be found in the most extreme parts of the east; where we may observe the same rites and ceremonies, and the same traditional histories, as are to be met with in their other settlements. The country called Phenicia could not have sufficed for the effecting all that is attributed to these mighty adventurers. It is necessary for me to acquaint the Reader, that the wonderful people to whom I allude were the descendants of Chus, and called Cuthites and Cuseans. They stood their ground at the general migration of families; but were at last scattered over the face of the earth. They were the first apostates from the truth, yet great in worldly wisdom. They introduced, wherever they came, many useful arts, and were looked up to as a superior order of beings: hence they were styled Heroes, Dæmons, Heliadæ, Macarians. They were joined in their expeditions by other nations, especially by the collateral branches of their family, the Mizraim, Caphtorim, and the sons of Canaan. These were all of the line of Ham, who was held by his posterity in the highest veneration. They called him Amon: and having in process of time raised him to a divinity, they worshipped him as the Sun; and from this worship they were styled Amonians. This is an appellation which will continually occur in the course of this work; and I am authorised in the use of it from Plutarch, from whom we may infer, that it was not uncommon among the sons of Ham. He specifies particularly, in respect to the
Egyptians, that when any two of that nation met, they used it as a term of honour in their[4] salutations, and called one another Amonians. This therefore will be the title by which I shall choose to distinguish the people of whom I treat, when I speak of them collectively; for under this denomination are included all of this family, whether they were Egyptians or Syrians, of Phenicia or of Canaan. They were a people who carefully preserved memorials of their ancestors, and of those great events which had preceded their dispersion. These were described in hieroglyphics upon pillars and obelisks: and when they arrived at the knowledge of letters, the same accounts were religiously maintained, both in their sacred archives, and popular records. It is mentioned of Sanchoniathon, the most antient of Gentile writers, that he obtained all his knowledge from some
writings of the Amonians. It was the good fortune of Sanchoniathon, says [5]Philo Biblius, to light upon some antient Amonian records, which had been preserved in the innermost part of a temple, and known to very few. Upon this discovery he applied himself with great diligence to make himself master of the contents: and having, by divesting them of the fable and allegory with which they were obscured, obtained his purpose, he brought the whole to a conclusion.
I should be glad to give the Reader a still farther insight into the system which I am about to pursue. But such is the scope of my inquiries, and the purport of my determinations, as may possibly create in him some prejudice to my design; all which would be obviated were he to be carried, step by step, to the general view, and be made partially acquainted, according as the scene opened. What I have to exhibit is in great measure new; and I shall be obliged to run counter to many received opinions, which length of time, and general assent, have in a manner rendered sacred. What is truly alarming, I shall be found to differ, not only from some few historians, as is the case in common controversy, but in some degree from all; and this in respect to many of the most essential points, upon which historical precision has been thought to depend. My meaning is, that I must set aside many supposed facts which have never been controverted; and dispute many



events which have not only been admitted as true, but have been looked up to as certain æras from whence other events were to be determined. All our knowledge of Gentile history must either come through the hands of the Grecians, or of the Romans, who copied from them. I shall therefore give a full account of the Helladian Greeks, as well as of the Iönim, or Ionians, in Asia: also of the Dorians, Leleges, and Pelasgi. What may appear very presumptuous, I shall deduce from their own histories many truths, with which they were totally unacquainted, and give to them an original, which they certainly did not know. They have bequeathed to us noble materials, of which it is time to make a serious use. It was their misfortune not to know the value of the data which they transmitted, nor the purport of their own intelligence.
It will be one part of my labour to treat of the Phenicians, whose history has been much mistaken: also of the Scythians, whose original has been hitherto a secret. From such an elucidation many good consequences will, I hope, ensue; as the Phenicians and Scythians have hitherto afforded the usual place of retreat for ignorance to shelter itself. It will therefore be my endeavour to specify and distinguish the various people under these denominations, of whom writers have so generally, and indiscriminately, spoken. I shall say a great deal about the Ethiopians, as their history has never been completely given: also of the Indi, and Indo-Scythæ, who seem to have been little regarded. There will be an account exhibited of the Cimmerian, Hyperborean, and Amazonian nations, as well as of the people of Colchis; in which the religion, rites, and original of those nations will be pointed out. I know of no writer who has written at large of the Cyclopians. Yet their history is of great antiquity, and abounds with matter of consequence. I shall, therefore, treat of them very fully, and at the same time of the great works which they performed; and subjoin an account of the Lestrygons, Lamii, Sirens, as there is a close correspondence between them.
As it will be my business to abridge history of every thing superfluous and foreign, I shall be obliged to set aside many antient law-givers, and princes, who were supposed to have formed republics, and to have founded kingdoms. I cannot acquiesce in the stale legends of Deucalion of Thessaly, of Inachus of Argos, and, Ægialeus of Sicyon; nor in the long line of princes who are derived from them. The supposed heroes of the first ages, in every country are equally fabulous. No such conquests were ever achieved as are ascribed to Osiris, Dionusus, and Sesostris. The histories of Hercules and Perseus are equally void of truth. I am convinced, and hope I shall satisfactorily prove, that Cadmus never brought letters to Greece; and that no such person existed as the Grecians have described. What I have said about Sesostris and Osiris, will be repeated about Ninus, and Semiramis, two personages, as ideal as the former. There never were such expeditions undertaken, nor conquests made, as are attributed to these princes: nor were any such empires constituted, as are supposed to have been established by them. I make as little account of the histories of Saturn, Janus, Pelops, Atlas, Dardanus, Minos of Crete, and Zoroaster of Bactria. Yet something mysterious, and of moment, is concealed under these various characters: and the investigation of this latent truth will be the principal part of my inquiry. In respect to Greece, I can afford credence to very few events, which were antecedent to the Olympiads. I cannot give the least assent to the story of Phryxus, and the golden fleece. It seems to me plain beyond doubt, that there were no such persons as the Grecian Argonauts: and that the expedition of Jason to Colchis was a fable.
After having cleared my way, I shall proceed to the sources, from whence the Grecians drew. I shall give an account of the Titans, and Titanic war, with the history of the Cuthites and antient Babylonians. This will be accompanied with the Gentile history of the Deluge, the migration of mankind from Shinar, and the dispersion from Babel. The whole will be crowned with an account of antient Egypt; wherein many circumstances of high consequence in chronology will be stated. In the execution of the whole there will be brought many surprising proofs in confirmation of the Mosaic account: and it will be found, from repeated evidence, that every thing, which the divine historian has transmitted, is most assuredly true. And though the nations, who preserved memorials of the Deluge, have not perhaps stated accurately the time of that event; yet it will be found the grand epocha, to which they referred; the highest point to which they could ascend. This was esteemed the renewal of the world; the new birth of mankind; and the ultimate of Gentile history. Some traces may perhaps be discernable in their rites and mysteries of the antediluvian system: but those very few, and hardly perceptible. It has been thought, that the Chaldaic, and Egyptian accounts exceed not only the times of the Deluge, but the æra of the world: and Scaliger
has accordingly carried the chronology of the latter beyond the term of his artificial[6] period. But upon inquiry we shall find the chronology of this people very different from the representations which have been given. This will be shewn by a plain and precise account, exhibited by the Egyptians themselves: yet overlooked and contradicted by the persons, through whose hands we receive it. Something of the same nature will be attempted in respect to Berosus; as well as to Abydenus, Polyhistor, and Appollodorus, who borrowed from him. Their histories contained



matter of great moment: and will afford some wonderful discoveries. From their evidence, and from that which has preceded, we shall find, that the Deluge was the grand epocha of every antient kingdom. It is to be observed, that when colonies made anywhere a settlement, they ingrafted their antecedent history upon the subsequent events of the place. And as in those days they could carry up the genealogy of their princes to the very source of all, it will be found, under whatever title he may come, that the first king in every country was Noah. For as he was mentioned first in the genealogy of their princes, he was in aftertimes looked upon as a real monarch; and represented as a great traveller, a mighty conqueror, and sovereign of the whole earth. This circumstance will appear even in the annals of the Egyptians: and though their chronology has been supposed to have reached beyond that of any nation, yet it coincides very happily with the accounts given by Moses.
In the prosecution of my system I shall not amuse the Reader with doubtful and solitary extracts; but collect all that can be obtained upon the subject, and shew the universal scope of writers. I shall endeavour particularly to compare sacred history with profane, and prove the general assent of mankind to the wonderful events recorded. My purpose is not to lay science in ruins; but instead of desolating to build up, and to rectify what time has impaired: to divest mythology of every foreign and unmeaning ornament, and to display the truth in its native simplicity: to shew, that all the rites and mysteries of the Gentiles were only so many memorials of their principal ancestors; and of the great occurrences to which they had been witnesses. Among these memorials the chief were the ruin of mankind by a flood; and the renewal of the world in one family. They had symbolical representations, by which these occurrences were commemorated: and the antient hymns in their temples were to the same purpose. They all related to the history of the first ages, and to the same events which are recorded by Moses.
Before I can arrive at this essential part of my inquiries, I must give an account of the rites and customs of antient Hellas; and of those people which I term Amonians. This I must do in order to shew, from whence they came: and from what quarter their evidence is derived. A great deal will be said of their religion and rites: also of their towers, temples, and Puratheia, where their worship was performed. The mistakes likewise of the Greeks in respect to antient terms, which they strangely perverted, will be exhibited in many instances: and much true history will be ascertained from a detection of this peculiar misapplication. It is a circumstance of great consequence, to which little attention has been paid. Great light however will accrue from examining this abuse, and observing the particular mode of error: and the only way of obtaining an insight must be by an etymological process, and by recurring to the primitive language of the people, concerning whom we are treating. As the Amonians betook themselves to regions widely separated; we shall find in every place where they settled, the same worship and ceremonies, and the same history of their ancestors. There will also appear a great similitude in the names of their cities and temples: so that we may be assured, that the whole was the operation of one and the same people. The learned Bochart saw this; and taking for granted, that the people were Phenicians, he attempted to interpret these names by the Hebrew language; of which he supposed the Phenician to have been a dialect. His design was certainly very ingenious, and carried on with a wonderful display of learning. He failed however: and of the nature of his failure I shall be obliged to take notice. It appears to me, as far as my reading can afford me light, that most antient names, not only of places, but of persons, have a manifest analogy. There is likewise a great correspondence to be observed in terms of science; and in the titles, which were of old bestowed upon magistrates and rulers. The same observation may be extended even to plants, and minerals, as well as to animals; especially to those which were esteemed at all sacred. Their names seem to be composed of the same, or similar elements; and bear a manifest relation to the religion in use among the Amonians, and to the Deity which they adored. This deity was the Sun: and most of the antient names will be found to be an assemblage of titles, bestowed upon that luminary. Hence there will appear a manifest correspondence between them, which circumstance is quite foreign to the system of Bochart. His etymologies are destitute of this collateral evidence; and have not the least analogy to support them.
In consequence of this I have ventured to give a list of some Amonian terms, which occur in the mythology of Greece, and in the histories of other nations. Most antient names seem to have been composed out of these elements: and into the same principles they may be again resolved by an easy, and fair evolution. I subjoin to these a short interpretation; and at the same time produce different examples of names and titles, which are thus compounded. From hence the Reader will see plainly my method of analysis, and the basis of my etymological inquiries.
As my researches are upon subjects very remote, and the histories to which I appeal, various; and as the truth is in great measure to be obtained by deduction, I have been obliged to bring my authorities immediately under the eye of the Reader. He may from thence be a witness of the



propriety of my appeal; and see that my inferences are true. This however will render my quotations very numerous, and may afford some matter of discouragement, as they are principally from the Greek authors. I have however in most places of consequence endeavoured to remedy this inconvenience, either by exhibiting previously the substance of what is quoted, or giving a subsequent translation. Better days may perhaps come; when the Greek language will be in greater repute, and its beauties more admired. As I am principally indebted to the Grecians for intelligence, I have in some respects adhered to their orthography, and have rendered antient terms as they were expressed by them. Indeed I do not see, why we should not render all names of Grecian original, as they were exhibited by that people, instead of taking our mode of pronunciation from the Romans. I scarce know any thing, which has been of greater detriment to antient history than the capriciousness of writers in never expressing foreign terms as they were rendered by the natives. I shall be found, however, to have not acted up uniformly to my principles, as I have only in some instances copied the Grecian orthography. I have ventured to abide by it merely in some particular terms, where I judged, that etymology would be concerned. For I was afraid, however just this method might appear, and warrantable, that it would seem too novel to be universally put in practice.
My purpose has been throughout to give a new turn to antient history, and to place it upon a surer foundation. The mythology of Greece is a vast assemblage of obscure traditions, which have been transmitted from the earliest times. They were described in hieroglyphics, and have been veiled in allegory: and the same history is often renewed under a different system, and arrangement. A great part of this intelligence has been derived to us from the Poets; by which means it has been rendered still more extravagant, and strange. We find the whole, like a grotesque picture, blazoned high, and glaring with colours, and filled with groups of fantastic imagery, such as we see upon an Indian screen; where the eye is painfully amused; but whence little can be obtained, which is satisfactory, and of service. We must, however, make this distinction, that in the allegorical representations of Greece, there was always a covert meaning, though it may have escaped our discernment. In short, we must look upon antient mythology as being yet in a chaotic state, where the mind of man has been wearied with roaming over the crude consistence without ever finding out one spot where it could repose in safety. Hence has arisen the demand, που στωι, which has been repeated for ages. It is my hope, and my presumption, that such a place of appulse may be found, where we may take our stand, and from whence we may have a full view of the mighty expanse before us; from whence also we may descry the original design, and order, of all those objects, which by length of time, and their own remoteness, have been rendered so confused and uncertain.
PREFACE
TO THE
THIRD VOLUME OF THE QUARTO EDITION,
BEGINNING AT VOL. iv. PAGE 1. IN THIS EDITION.
Through the whole process of my inquiries, it has been my endeavour, from some plain and determinate principles, to open the way to many interesting truths. And as I have shewn the certainty of an universal Deluge from the evidences of most nations, to which we can gain access, I come now to give an history of the persons who survived that event; and of the families which were immediately descended from them. After having mentioned their residence in the region of Ararat, and their migration from it, I shall give an account of the roving of the Cuthites, and of their coming to the plains of Shinar, from whence they were at last expelled. To this are added observations upon the histories of Chaldea and Egypt; also of Hellas, and Ionia; and of every other country which was in any degree occupied by the sons of Chus. There have been men of learning who have denominated their works from the families, of which they treated; and have accordingly sent them into the world under the title of Phaleg, Japhet, and Javan. I might, in like manner, have prefixed to mine the name either of Cuth, or Cuthim; for, upon the history of this people my system chiefly turns. It may be asked, if there were no other great families upon earth, besides that of the Cuthites, worthy of record: if no other people ever performed great actions, and made themselves respectable to posterity. Such there possibly may have been; and the field is



open to any who may choose to make inquiry. My taking this particular path does not in the least abridge others from prosecuting different views, wherever they may see an opening.
As my researches are deep, and remote, I shall sometimes take the liberty of repeating what has preceded; that the truths which I maintain may more readily be perceived. We are oftentimes, by the importunity of a persevering writer, teazed into an unsatisfactory compliance, and yield a painful assent; but, upon closing the book, our scruples return, and we lapse at once into doubt and darkness. It has therefore been my rule to bring vouchers for every thing, which I maintain; and though I might upon the renewal of my argument refer to another volume, and a distant page, yet I many times choose to repeat my evidence, and bring it again under immediate inspection. And if I do not scruple labour and expense, I hope the reader will not be disgusted by this seeming redundancy in my arrangement. What I have now to present to the public, contains matter of great moment, and should I be found to be in the right, it will afford a sure basis for the future history of the world. None can well judge either of the labour, or utility of the work, but those who have been conversant in the writings of chronologers, and other learned men, upon these subjects, and seen the difficulties with which they were embarrassed. Great, undoubtedly, must have been the learning and perspicuity of a Petavius, Perizonius, Scaliger, Grotius, and Le Clerc; also of an Usher, Pearson, Marsham, and Newton. Yet it may possibly be found at the close, that a feeble arm has effected what those prodigies in science have overlooked.
Many, who have finished their progress, and are determined in their principles, will not perhaps so readily be brought over to my opinion. But they who are beginning their studies, and passing through a process of Grecian literature, will find continual evidences arise; almost every step will afford fresh proofs in favour of my system. As the desolation of the world by a deluge, and the renewal of it in one person, are points in these days particularly controverted; many, who are enemies to Revelation, upon seeing these truths ascertained, may be led to a more intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures: and such an insight cannot but be productive of good. For our faith depends upon historical experience: and it is mere ignorance, that makes infidels. Hence it is possible, that some may be won over by historical evidence, whom a refined theological argument cannot reach. An illness, which some time ago confined me to my bed, and afterwards to my chamber, afforded me, during its recess, an opportunity of making some versions from the poets whom I quote, when I was little able to do any thing of more consequence. The translation from Dionysius was particularly done at that season, and will give the reader some faint idea of the original, and its beauties.
I cannot conclude without acknowledging my obligations to a most worthy and learned[7] friend for his zeal towards my work; and for his assistance both in this, and my former publication. I am indebted to him not only for his judicious remarks, but for his goodness in transcribing for me many of my dissertations, without which my progress would have been greatly retarded. His care likewise, and attention, in many other articles, afford instances of friendship which I shall ever gratefully remember.
RADICALS.
Πειθους δ' εστι κελευθος, αληθειη γαρ οπηδει.——PARMENIDES.
The materials, of which I purpose to make use in the following inquiries, are comparatively few, and will be contained within a small compass. They are such as are to be found in the composition of most names, which occur in antient mythology: whether they relate to Deities then reverenced; or to the places, where their worship was introduced. But they appear no where so plainly, as in the names of those places, which were situated in Babylonia and Egypt. From these parts they were, in process of time, transferred to countries far remote; beyond the Ganges eastward, and to the utmost bounds of the Mediterranean west; wherever the sons of Ham under their various denominations either settled or traded. For I have mentioned that this people were great adventurers; and began an extensive commerce in very early times. They got footing in many parts; where they founded cities, which were famous in their day. They likewise erected towers and temples: and upon headlands and promontories they raised pillars for sea-marks to direct them in their perilous expeditions. All these were denominated from circumstances, that had some reference to the religion, which this people professed; and to the ancestors, whence they sprung. The Deity, which they originally worshipped, was the Sun. But they soon conferred his titles upon some of their ancestors: whence arose a mixed worship. They particularly deified the great



Patriarch, who was the head of their line; and worshipped him as the fountain of light: making the Sun only an emblem of his influence and power. They called him Bal, and Baal: and there were others of their ancestry joined with him, whom they styled the Baalim. Chus was one of these: and this idolatry began among his sons. In respect then to the names, which this people, in process of time, conferred either upon the Deities they worshipped, or upon the cities, which they founded; we shall find them to be generally made up of some original terms for a basis, such as Ham, Cham, and Chus: or else of the titles, with which those personages were, in process of time, honoured. These were Thoth, Men or Menes, Ab, El, Aur, Ait, Ees or Ish, On, Bel, Cohen, Keren, Ad, Adon, Ob, Oph, Apha, Uch, Melech, Anac, Sar, Sama, Samaïm. We must likewise take notice of those common names, by which places are distinguished, such as Kir, Caer, Kiriath, Carta, Air, Col, Cala, Beth, Ai, Ain, Caph, and Cephas. Lastly are to be inserted the particles Al and Pi; which were in use among the antient Egyptians.
Of these terms I shall first treat; which I look upon as so many elements, whence most names in antient mythology have been compounded; and into which they may be easily resolved: and the history, with which they are attended, will, at all times, plainly point out, and warrant the etymology.
HAM or CHAM.
The first of the terms here specified is Ham; at different times, and in different places, expressed
Cham, Chom, [8]Chamus. Many places were from him denominated Cham Ar, Cham Ur, Chomana, Comara, Camarina. Ham, by the Egyptians, was compounded Am-On, Αμων and
Αμμων. He is to be found under this name among many nations in the east; which was by the
Greeks expressed Amanus, and [9]Omanus. Ham, and Cham are words, which imply heat, and the
consequences of heat; and from them many words in other languages, such as [10]Καυμα
Caminus, Camera, were derived. Ham, as a Deity, was esteemed the [11]Sun: and his priests were styled Chamin, Chaminim, and Chamerim. His name is often found compounded with other terms, as in Cham El, Cham Ees, Cam Ait: and was in this manner conferred both on persons and
places. From hence Camillus, Camilla, Camella Sacra, Comates, Camisium, [12]Camirus, Chemmis, with numberless other words, are derived. Chamma was the title of the hereditary
[13]priestess of Diana: and the Puratheia, where the rites of fire were carried on, were called Chamina, and Chaminim, whence came the Caminus of the Latines. They were sacred hearths, on which was preserved a perpetual fire in honour of Cham. The idols of the Sun called by the same
[14]name: for it is said of the good king Josiah, that they brake down the altars of Baalim—in his presence; and the Chaminim (or images of Cham) that were on high above them, he cut down.
They were also styled Chamerim, as we learn from the prophet [15]Zephaniah. Ham was esteemed the Zeus of Greece, and Jupiter of Latium. [16]Αμμους, ὁ Ζευς, Αριστοτελει. [17]Αμμουν γαρ
Αιγυπτιοι καλεουσι τον Δια. Plutarch says, that, of all the Egyptian names which seemed to have any correspondence with the Zeus of Greece, Amoun or Ammon was the most peculiar and
adequate. He speaks of many people, who were of this opinion: [18]Ετι δε των πολλων νομιζοντων ιδιον παρ' Αιγυπτιοις ονομα του Διος ειναι τον Αμουν, ὁ παραγοντες ἡμεις Αμμωνα λεγομεν. From Egypt his name and worship were brought into Greece; as
indeed were the names of almost all the Deities there worshipped. [19]Σχεδον δε και παντα τα
ουνοματα των Θεων εξ Αιγυπτου εληλυθε ες την Ἑλλαδα. Almost all the names of the Gods in Greece were adventitious, having been brought thither from Egypt.
CHUS.
Chus was rendered by the Greeks Χυσος, Chusus; but, more commonly, Χρυσος: and the places
denominated from him were changed to Χρυσε, Chruse; and to Chrusopolis. His name was often
compounded [20]Chus-Or, rendered by the Greeks Χρυσωρ, Chrusor, and Chrusaor; which, among the Poets, became a favourite epithet, continually bestowed upon Apollo. Hence there were temples dedicated to him, called Chrusaoria. Chus, in the Babylonish dialect, seems to have
been called Cuth; and many places, where his posterity settled, were styled [21]Cutha, Cuthaia,
Cutaia, Ceuta, Cotha, compounded [22]Cothon. He was sometimes expressed Casus, Cessus, Casius; and was still farther diversified.



Chus was the father of all those nations, styled [23]Ethiopians, who were more truly called Cuthites and Cuseans. They were more in number, and far more widely extended, than has been imagined. The history of this family will be the principal part of my inquiry.
CANAAN.
Canaan seems, by the Egyptians and Syrians, to have been pronounced Cnaan: which was by the Greeks rendered Cnas, and Cna. Thus we are told by Stephanus Byzantinus, that the antient name of Phenicia was Cna. Χνα, ὁυτος ἡ Φοινικη εκαλειτο. το εθνικον Χναιος. The same is said by Philo Biblius, from Sanchoniathon. [24]Χνα του πρωτου μετονομασθεντος Φοινικος.
And, in another place, he says, that Isiris, the same as Osiris, was the brother to Cna. [25]Ισιρις
αδελφος Χνα; the purport of which is conformable to the account in the Scriptures, that the Egyptians were of a collateral line with the people of Canaan; or, that the father of the Mizräim and the Canaanites were brothers.
MIZRAIM.
This person is looked upon as the father of the Egyptians: on which account one might expect to meet with many memorials concerning him: but his history is so veiled under allegory and titles, that no great light can be obtained. It is thought, by many learned men, that the term, Mizräim, is properly a plural; and that a people are by it signified, rather than a person. This people were the Egyptians: and the head of their family is imagined to have been, in the singular, Misor, or Metzor. It is certain that Egypt, by Stephanus Byzantinus, is, amongst other names, styled Μυαρα, which, undoubtedly, is a mistake for Μυσαρα, the land of Musar, or Mysar. It is, by
[26]Eusebius and Suidas, called Mestraia; by which is meant the land of Metzor, a different
rendering of Mysor. Sanchoniathon alludes to this person under the name of [27]Μισωρ, Misor; and joins him with Sydic: both which he makes the sons of the Shepherds Amunus and Magus. Amunus, I make no doubt, is Amun, or Ham, the real father of Misor, from whom the Mizräim are supposed to be descended. By Magus, probably, is meant Chus, the father of those worshippers of fire, the Magi: the father, also, of the genuine Scythæ, who were styled Magog. The Canaanites, likewise, were his offspring: and, among these, none were more distinguished than those of Said, or Sidon; which, I imagine, is alluded to under the name of Sydic. It must be confessed, that the author derives it from Sydic, justice: and, to say the truth, he has, out of antient terms, mixed so many feigned personages with those that are real, that it is not possible to arrive at the truth.
NIMROD.
It is said of this person, by Moses, that he was the son of Cush. [28]And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth: he was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, even as Nimrod, the mighty hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was
Babel. His history is plainly alluded to under the character of Alorus, the first king of [29]Chaldea; but more frequently under the title of Orion. This personage is represented by Homer as of a
gigantic make; and as being continually in pursuit of wild [30]beasts. The Cuthite Colonies, which went westward, carried with them memorials of this their ancestor; and named many places from him: and in all such places there will be found some peculiar circumstances, which will point out
the great hunter, alluded to in their name. The Grecians generally styled him [31]Νεβρωδ, Nebrod: hence places called by his name are expressed Nebrod, Nebrodes, Nebrissa. In Sicily was
a mountain Nebrodes, called by Strabo in the plural [32]τα Νεβρωδε ορη. It was a famous place for hunting; and for that reason had been dedicated to Nimrod. The poet Gratius takes notice of its being stocked with wild beasts:
[33]Cantatus Graiis Acragas, victæque fragosum Nebrodem liquere feræ.
And Solinus speaks to the same purpose: [34]Nebrodem damæ et hinnuli pervagantur. At the foot of the mountain were the warm baths of Himera.
The term Νεβρος, Nebros, which was substituted by the Greeks for Nimrod, signifying a fawn, gave occasion to many allusions about a fawn, and fawn-skin, in the Dionusiaca, and other



mysteries. There was a town Nebrissa, near the mouth of the Bætis in Spain, called, by Pliny,
Veneria;
[35]
Inter æstuaria Bætis oppidum Nebrissa, cognomine Veneria. This, I should think, was a mistake for Venaria; for there were places of that name. Here were preserved the same rites and memorials, as are mentioned above; wherein was no allusion to Venus, but to Nimrod and Bacchus. The island, and its rites, are mentioned by Silius Italicus.
[36]
Ac Nebrissa Dionusæis conscia thyrsis, Quam Satyri coluere leves, redimitaque sacrâ Nebride.
The Priests at the Bacchanalia, as well as the Votaries, were habited in this manner.
[37]
Inter matres impia Mænas Comes Ogygio venit Iaccho, Nebride sacrâ præcincta latus.
Statius describes them in the same habit.
[38]
Hic chelyn, hic flavam maculoso Nebrida tergo, Hic thyrsos, hic plectra ferit.
The history of Nimrod was, in great measure, lost in the superior reverence shewn to Chus, or Bacchus: yet, there is reason to think, that divine honours were of old paid to him. The family of
the Nebridæ at
[39]
Athens, and another of the same name at Cos, were, as we may infer from their history, the posterity of people, who had been priests to Nimrod. He seems to have been worshipped in Sicily under the names of Elorus, Belorus, and Orion. He was likewise styled [40]
Belus: but as this was merely a title, and conferred upon other persons, it renders his history very difficult to be distinguished.
TITLES DEITY.
Theuth, Thoth, Taut, Taautes, are the same title diversified; and belong to the chief god of Egypt.
Eusebius speaks of him as the same as Hermes.
[41]
Ὁν Αιγυπτιοι μεν εκαλεσαν Θωυθ, Αλεξανδρεις δε Θωθ, Ἑρμην δε Ἑλληνες μετεφρασαν. From Theuth the Greeks formed ΘΕΟΣ; which, with that nation, was the most general name of the deity. Plato, in his treatise,
named Philebus, mentions him by the name of
[42]
Θευθ. He was looked upon as a great benefactor, and the first cultivator of the vine.
[43]
Πρωτος Θωθ εδαη δρεπανην επι βοτρυν αγειρειν.
He was also supposed to have found out letters: which invention is likewise attributed to Hermes. [44]
Απο Μισωρ Τααυτος, ὁς ἑυρε την των πρωτων στοιχειων γραφην.——Ἑλληνες δε Ἑρμην εκαλεσαν. Suidas calls him Theus; and says, that he was the same as Arez, styled by the
Arabians Theus Arez, and so worshipped at Petra. Θευσαρης τουτ' εστι Θεος Αρης, εν
Πετρᾳ της Αραβιας. Instead of a statue, there was λιθος μελας, τετραγωνος, ατυπωτος, a black, square pillar of stone, without any figure, or representation. It was the same deity, which the Germans and Celtæ worshipped under the name of Theut-Ait, or Theutates; whose sacrifices were very cruel, as we learn from Lucan.
[45]
Et quibus immitis placatur sanguine diro Theutates.
AB.
Ab signifies a father, similar to אב of the Hebrews. It is often found in composition, as in Ab-El, Ab-On, Ab-Or.
AUR, OUR, OR.



Aur, sometimes expressed Or, Ur, and Our, signifies both light and fire. Hence came the Orus of
the Egyptians, a title given to the Sun.
[46]
Quod solem vertimus, id in Hebræo est אור , Ur; quod lucem, et ignem, etiam et Solem denotat. It is often compounded with the term above, and rendered Abor, Aborus, Aborras: and it is otherwise diversified. This title was often given to Chus by his descendants; whom they styled Chusorus. From Aur, taken as an element, came Uro, Ardeo; as a Deity, oro, hora, ὡρα, Ἱερον, Ἱερευς. Zeus was styled Cham-Ur, rendered
Κωμυρος by the Greeks; and under this title was worshipped at Halicarnassus. He is so called by
Lycophron.
[47]
Ημος καταιθων θυσθλα Κωμυρῳ Λεων. Upon which the Scholiast observes; (Κωμυρος) ὁ Ζευς εν Ἁλικαρνασῳ τιμᾳται.
EL.
El, Al, Ηλ, sometimes expressed Eli, was the name of the true God; but by the Zabians was
transferred to the Sun: whence the Greeks borrowed their Ἡλιος, and Ηελιος. El, and Elion,
were titles, by which the people of Canaan distinguished their chief Deity.
[48]
Γινεται τις Ελιουν, καλουμενος ὑψιστος. This they sometimes still farther compounded, and made
Abelion: hence inscriptions are to be found
[49]
DEO ABELLIONI. El according to Damascius
was a title given to Cronus.
[50]
Φοινικες και Συροι τον Κρονον Ηλ, και Βηλ, και Βολαθην επονομαζουσι. The Phenicians and Syrians name Cronus Eel, and Beel, and Bolathes. The Canaanitish term Elion is a compound of Eli On, both titles of the Sun: hence the former is often
joined with Aur, and Orus.
[51]
Elorus, and Alorus, were names both of persons and places. It is sometimes combined with Cham: whence we have Camillus, and Camulus: under which name the Deity of the Gentile world was in many places worshipped. Camulus and Camillus were in a manner antiquated among the Romans; but their worship was kept up in other countries. We find
in Gruter an inscription
[52]
DEO CAMULO: and another, CAMULO. SANCTO. FORTISSIMO. They were both the same Deity, a little diversified; who was worshipped by the Hetrurians, and
esteemed the same as Hermes.
[53]
Tusci Camillum appellant Mercurium. And not only the Deity, but the minister and attendant had the same name: for the priests of old were almost universally denominated from the God whom they served, or from his temple. The name appears to have been
once very general.
[54]
Rerum omnium sacrarum administri Camilli dicebantur. But Plutarch seems
to confine the term to one particular office and person.
[55]
Τον ὑπηρετουντα τῳ Ἱερῳ του Διος αμφιθαλη παιδα λεγεσθαι Καμιλλον, ὡς και τον Ἑρμην· ὁυτως ενιοι των Ἑλληνων Καμιλλον απο της διακονιας προσηγορευον. He supposes the name to have been given to Hermes, on account of the service and duty enjoined him. But there is nothing of this nature to be inferred from the terms. The Hermes of Egypt had nothing similar to his correspondent in Greece. Camillus was the name of the chief God, Cham-El, the same as Elion, ὁ
ὑψιστος. He was sometimes expressed Casmillus; but still referred to Hermes.
[56]
Κασμιλλος ὁ Ἑρμης εστιν, ὡς ἱστορει Διονυσιοδωρος. The Deity El was particularly invoked by the eastern nations, when they made an attack in battle: at such time they used to cry out, El-El, and Al-Al. This Mahomet could not well bring his proselytes to leave off: and therefore changed it to Allah; which the Turks at this day make use of, when they shout in joining battle. It was, however, an idolatrous invocation, originally made to the God of war; and not unknown to the Greeks. Plutarch speaks of it as no uncommon exclamation; but makes the Deity feminine.
[57]
Κλυθ' ΑΛΑΛΑ, πολεμου θυγατερ.
Hence we have in Hesychius the following interpretations; αλαλαζει, επινικιως ηχει. Αλαλαγμος, επινικιος ὑμνος. Ελελευ, επιφωνημα πολεμικον. It is probably the same as
הלל in Isaiah,
[58]
How art thou fallen, Halal, thou son of Sehor.
ON and EON.
On, Eon, or Aon, was another title of the Sun among the Amonians: and so we find it explained by Cyril upon Hosea: Ων δε εστιν ὁ Ἡλιος: and speaking of the Egyptians in the same
comment, he says, Ων δε εστι παρ' αυτοις ὁ Ἡλιος. The Seventy likewise, where the word
occurs in Scripture, interpret it the Sun; and call the city of On, Heliopolis.
[59]
Και εδωκεν αυτῳ



την Ασενεθ θυγατερα Πετεφρη Ἱερεως Ἡλιουπολεως. Theophilus, from Manetho, speaks
of it in the same manner:
[60]
Ων, ἡτις εστιν Ἡλιοπολις. And the Coptic Pentateuch renders the city On by the city of the Sun. Hence it was, that Ham, who was worshipped as the Sun, got the name of Amon, and Ammon; and was styled Baal-Hamon. It is said of Solomon, that he had a
vineyard at
[61]
Baal-Hamon; a name probably given to the place by his Egyptian wife, the daughter of Pharaoh. The term El was combined in the same manner; and many places sacred to the Sun were styled El-on, as well as El-our. It was sometimes rendered Eleon; from whence came ἡλιος, and ἡλιον. The Syrians, Cretans, and Canaanites, went farther, and made a combination of the terms Ab-El-Eon, Pater Summus Sol, or Pater Deus Sol; hence they formed Abellon, and Abelion before mentioned. Hesychius interprets Αβελιον, Ἡλιον· Αβελιον, Ἡλιακον.
Vossius thinks, and with good reason, that the Apollo of Greece and Rome was the same as the
Abelion of the East.
[62]
Fortasse Apollo ex Cretico Αβελιος· nam veteres Romani pro Apollo dixere Apello: ut pro homo, hemo; pro bonus, benus; ac similia. The Sun was also worshipped under the title Abaddon; which, as we are informed by the Evangelist, was the same as Apollo; or,
as he terms him, Απολλυων:
[63]
Ονομα αυτῳ Ἑβραϊστι Αβαδδων, και εν τῃ Ἑλληνικῃ Απολλυων.
AIT.
Another title of Ham, or the Sun, was Ait, and Aith: a term, of which little notice has been taken; yet of great consequence in respect to etymology. It occurs continually in Egyptian names of places, as well as in the composition of those, which belong to Deities, and men. It relates to fire, light, and heat; and to the consequences of heat. We may, in some degree, learn its various and opposite significations when compounded, from antient words in the Greek language, which were derived from it. Several of these are enumerated in Hesychius. Αιθαι, μελαιναι. Αιθειν, καιειν. Αιθαλοεν (a compound of Aith El), κεκαυμενον. Αιθινος, καπνος. Αιθον,
λαμπρον. Αιθωνα (of the same etymology, from Aith-On) μελανα, πυρωδη.
[64]
Αιθος, καυμα. The Egyptians, when they consecrated any thing to their Deity, or made it a symbol of
any supposed attribute, called it by the name of that attribute, or
[65]
emanation: and as there was scarce any thing, but what was held sacred by them, and in this manner appropriated; it necessarily happened, that several objects had often the same reference, and were denominated alike. For, not only men took to themselves the sacred titles, but birds, beasts, fishes, reptiles, together with trees, plants, stones, drugs, and minerals, were supposed to be under some particular influence; and from thence received their names. And if they were not quite alike, they were,
however, made up of elements very similar. Ham, as the Sun, was styled
[66]
Ait; and Egypt, the land of Ham, had, in consequence of it, the name of Ait, rendered by the Greeks Αετια: Εκληθη
(ἡ Αιγυπτος) και Αερια, και Ποταμια, και Αιθισπια, και
[67]
ΑΕΤΙΑ. One of the most
antient names of the Nile was Ait, or Αετος. It was also a name given to the Eagle, as the bird particularly sacred to the Sun: and Homer alludes to the original meaning of the word, when he
terms the Eagle
[68]
Αιετος αιθων. Among the parts of the human body, it was appropriated to
the
[69]
heart: for the heart in the body may be esteemed what the Sun is in his system, the source of heat and life, affording the same animating principle. This word having these two senses was the reason why the Egyptians made a heart over a vase of burning incense, an emblem of their
country.
[70]
Αιγυπτον δε γραφοντες θυμιατηριον καιομενον ζωγραφουσι, και επανω ΚΑΡΔΙΑΝ. This term occurs continually in composition. Athyr, one of the Egyptian months, was formed of Ath-Ur. It was also one of the names of that place, where the shepherds resided in Egypt; and to which the Israelites succeeded. It stood at the upper point of Delta, and was particularly sacred to אור Ur, or Orus: and thence called Athur-ai, or the place of Athur. At the
departure of the shepherds it was ruined by King Amosis.
[71]
Κατεσκαψε δε την Αθυριαν Αμωσις.
As Egypt was named Aith, and Ait; so other countries, in which colonies from thence settled, were styled Ethia and Athia. The sons of Chus founded a colony in Colchis; and we find a king of that country named Ait; or, as the Greeks expressed it, Αιητης: and the land was also distinguished by that characteristic. Hence Arete in the Orphic Argonautics, speaking of Medea's returning to Colchis, expresses this place by the terms ηθεα Κολχων:



[72]Οιχεθω πατρος τε δομον, και ες ηθεα Κολχων.
It is sometimes compounded Ath-El, and Ath-Ain; from whence the Greeks formed [73]Αθηλα,
and Αθηνα, titles, by which they distinguished the Goddess of wisdom. It was looked upon as a term of high honour, and endearment. Venus in Apollonius calls Juno, and Minerva, by way of respect, Ηθειαι:
[74]Ηθειαι, τις δευρο νοος, χρειω τε, κομιζει;
Menelaus says to his brother Agamemnon, [75]Τιφθ' ὁυτως, Ηθειε, κορυσσεαι; And [76]Τιπτε
μοι, Ηθειε κεφαλη, δευρ' ειληλουθας, are the words of Achilles to the shade of his lost
Patroclus. Ηθειος, in the original acceptation, as a title, signified Solaris, Divinus, Splendidus:
but, in a secondary sense, it denoted any thing holy, good, and praiseworthy. [77]Αλλα μιν
Ηθειον καλεω και νοσφιν εοντα, says Eumæus, of his long absent and much honoured master. I will call him good and noble, whether he be dead or alive. From this antient term were derived the ηθος and ηθικα of the Greeks.
I have mentioned that it is often compounded, as in Athyr: and that it was a name conferred on places where the Amonians settled. Some of this family came, in early times, to Rhodes and Lemnos: of which migrations I shall hereafter treat. Hence, one of the most antient names of
[78]Rhodes was Aithraia, or the Island of Athyr; so called from the worship of the Sun: and Lemnos was denominated Aithalia, for the same reason, from Aith-El. It was particularly devoted to the God of fire; and is hence styled Vulcania by the Poet:
[79]Sumnmis Vulcania surgit Lemnos aquis.
Ethiopia itself was named both [80]Aitheria, and Aeria, from Aur, and Athyr: and Lesbos, which
had received a colony of Cuthites, was reciprocally styled [81]Æthiope. The people of Canaan and Syria paid a great reverence to the memory of Ham: hence, we read of many places in those parts named Hamath, Amathus, Amathusia. One of the sons of Canaan seems to have been thus called:
for it is said, that Canaan was the father of the [82]Hamathite. A city of this name stood to the east of mount Libanus; whose natives were the Hamathites alluded to here. There was another Hamath, in Cyprus, by the Greeks expressed Αμαθους, of the same original as the former. We
read of Eth-Baal, a king of [83]Sidon, who was the father of Jezebel; and of [84]Athaliah, who was her daughter. For Ath was an oriental term, which came from Babylonia and Chaldea to Egypt; and from thence to Syria and Canaan. Ovid, though his whole poem be a fable, yet copies the modes of those countries of which he treats. On this account, speaking of an Ethiopian, he introduces him by the name of Eth-Amon, but softened by him to Ethemon.
[85]Instabant parte sinistrâ Chaonius Molpeus, dextrâ Nabathæus Ethemon.
Ath was sometimes joined to the antient title Herm; which the Grecians, with a termination, made Ἑρμης. From Ath-Herm came Θερμαι, Θερμος, Θερμαινω. These terms were sometimes reversed, and rendered Herm-athena.
AD.
Ad is a title which occurs very often in composition, as in Ad-Or, Ad-On; from whence was formed Adorus, Adon, and Adonis. It is sometimes found compounded with itself; and was thus made use of for a supreme title, with which both Deities and kings were honoured. We read of
Hadad, king of [86]Edom: and there was another of the same name at Damascus, whose son and
successor was styled [87]Benhadad. According to Nicolaus Damascenus, the kings of Syria, for
nine generations, had the name of [88]Adad. There-was a prince Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of
[89]Zobah: and Hadoram, son of the king of [90]Hamath. The God Rimmon was styled Adad: and
mention is made by the Prophet of the mourning of Adad Rimmon in the valley of [91]Megiddo.
The feminine of it was Ada; of which title mention is made by Plutarch in speaking of a [92]queen



of Caria. It was a sacred title, and appropriated by the Babylonians to their chief
[93]
Goddess. Among all the eastern nations Ad was a peculiar title, and was originally conferred upon the Sun: and, if we may credit Macrobius, it signified One, and was so interpreted by the Assyrians: [94]
Deo, quem summum maximumque venerantur, Adad nomen dederunt. Ejus nominis interpretatio significat unus. Hunc ergo ut potissimum adorant Deum.—Simulacrum Adad insigne cernitur radiis inclinatis. I suspect that Macrobius, in his representation, has mistaken the cardinal number for the ordinal; and that what he renders one should be first, or chief. We find that it was a sacred title; and, when single, it was conferred upon a Babylonish Deity: but, when repeated, it must denote greater excellence: for the Amonians generally formed their superlative by doubling the positive: thus Rab was great; Rabrab signified very great. It is, indeed, plain from the account, that it must have been a superlative; for he says it was designed to represent what was esteemed summum maximumque, the most eminent and great. I should, therefore, think that Adad, in its primitive sense, signified πρωτος, and πρωτευων: and, in a secondary meaning, it denoted a chief, or prince. We may by these means rectify a mistake in Philo, who makes Sanchoniathon say, that Adodus of Phenicia was king of the country. He renders the name, Adodus: but we know, for certain, that it was expressed Adad, or Adadus, in Edom, Syria, and Canaan. He, moreover, makes him βασιλευς Θεων, King of the Gods: but, it is plain, that the word Adad is a compound: and, as the two terms of which it is made up are precisely the same, there should be a reciprocal resemblance in the translation. If Ad be a chief, or king; Adad should be superlatively so, and signify a king of kings. I should therefore suspect, that, in the original of Sanchoniathon, not βασιλευς Θεων, but βασιλευς βασιλεων was the true reading. In short, Ad, and Ada,
signified first, πρωτος; and, in a more lax sense, a prince or ruler: Adad, therefore, which is a
reiteration of this title, means πρωτος των πρωτων, or πρωτευοντων; and answers to the most High, or most Eminent.
Ham was often styled Ad-Ham, or Adam contracted; which has been the cause of much mistake.
There were many places
[95]
named Adam, Adama, Adamah, Adamas, Adamana; which had no reference to the protoplast, but were, by the Amonians, denominated from the head of their family.
EES and IS.
Ees, rendered As and Is, like אש of the Hebrews, related to light and fire; and was one of the titles of the Sun. It is sometimes compounded Ad-Ees, and Ad-Is; whence came the Hades of the Greeks, and Atis and Attis of the Asiatics; which were names of the same Deity, the Sun. Many
places were hence denominated: particularly a city in Africa, mentioned by
[96]
Polybius. There
was a river
[97]
Adesa, which passed by the city Choma in Asia minor. It was, moreover, the name of one of the chief and most antient cities in Syria, said to have been built by Nimrod. It was, undoubtedly, the work of some of his brotherhood, the sons of Chus, who introduced there the rites of fire, and the worship of the Sun; whence it was styled Adesa, rendered by the Greeks
Edessa. One of the names of fire, among those in the East, who worship it, is
[98]
Atesh at this day. The term As, like Adad, before mentioned, is sometimes compounded with itself, and rendered
Asas, and Azaz; by the Greeks expressed Αζαζος and
[99]
Αζιζος. In the very place spoken of above, the Deity was worshipped under the name of Azizus. The Emperor Julian acquaints us, in
his hymn to the
[100]
Sun, that the people of Edessa possessed a region, which, from time immemorial, had been sacred to that luminary: that there were two subordinate Deities, Monimus and Azizus, who were esteemed coadjutors, and assessors to the chief God. He supposes them to have been the same as Mars and Mercury: but herein this zealous emperor failed; and did not understand the theology which he was recommending. Monimus and Azizus were both names of
the same God, the Deity of Edessa, and
[101]
Syria. The former is, undoubtedly, a translation of
Adad, which signifies μονας, or
[102]
unitas: though, as I have before shewn, more properly primus. Azizus is a reduplication of a like term, being compounded with itself; and was of the same purport as Ades, or Ad Ees, from whence the place was named. It was a title not unknown in Greece: for Ceres was, of old, called Azazia; by the Ionians, Azesia. Hesychius observes, Αζησια, ἡ Δημητηρ. Proserpine, also, had this name. In the same author we learn that αζα, aza,
signified ασβολος, or sun-burnt: which shews plainly to what the primitive word
[103]
related. This word is often found combined with Or; as in Asorus, and Esorus, under which titles the Deity
was worshipped in
[104]
Syria,
[105]
Sicily, and Carthage: of the last city he was supposed to have been the founder. It is often compounded with El and Il; and many places were from thence denominated Alesia, Elysa, Eleusa, Halesus, Elysus, Eleusis, by apocope Las, Lasa, Læsa, Lasaia;



also, Lissa, Lissus, Lissia. Sometimes we meet with these terms reversed; and, instead of El Ees, they are rendered Ees El: hence we have places named Azilis, Azila, Asyla, contracted Zelis, Zela, Zeleia, Zelitis; also Sele, Sela, Sala, Salis, Sillas, Silis, Soli. All these places were founded or denominated by people of the Amonian worship: and we may always, upon inquiry, perceive something very peculiar in their history and situation. They were particularly devoted to the worship of the Sun; and they were generally situated near hot springs, or else upon foul and fetid lakes, and pools of bitumen. It is, also, not uncommon to find near them mines of salt and nitre; and caverns sending forth pestilential exhalations. The Elysian plain, near the Catacombs in Egypt, stood upon the foul Charonian canal; which was so noisome, that every fetid ditch and cavern was from it called Charonian. Asia Proper comprehended little more than Phrygia, and a part of Lydia; and was bounded by the river Halys. It was of a most inflammable soil; and there were many fiery eruptions about Caroura, and in Hyrcania, which latter was styled by the Greeks
κεκαυμενη. Hence, doubtless, the region had the name of [106]Asia, or the land of fire. One of its
most antient cities, and most reverenced, was Hierapolis, famous for its hot [107]fountains. Here
was also a sacred cavern, styled by [108]Strabo Plutonium, and Charonium; which sent up pestilential effluvia. Photius, in the life of Isidorus, acquaints us, that it was the temple of Apollo
at Hierapolis, within whose precincts these deadly vapours arose. [109]Εν Ἱεραπολει της Φρυγιας Ἱερον ην Απολλωνος, ὑπο δε τον ναον καταβασιον ὑπεκειτο, θανασιμους αναπνοας παρεχομενον. He speaks of this cavity as being immediately under the edifice.
Four caverns of this sort, and styled Charonian, are mentioned by [110]Strabo in this part of the world. Pliny, speaking of some Charonian hollows in Italy, says, that the exhalations were
insupportable. [111]Spiracula vocant, alii Charoneas scrobes, mortiferum spiritum exhalantes. It may appear wonderful; but the Amonians were determined in the situation both of their cities and temples by these strange phænomena. They esteemed no places so sacred as those where there were fiery eruptions, uncommon steams, and sulphureous exhalations. In Armenia, near
[112]Comana, and Camisena, was the temple of [113]Anait, or fountain of the Sun. It was a Persic and Babylonish Deity, as well as an Armenian, which was honoured with Puratheia, where the rites of fire were particularly kept up. The city itself was named Zela; and close behind it was a large nitrous lake. In short, from the Amonian terms, Al-As, came the Grecian ἁλος, ἁλας, ἁλς; as, from the same terms reversed (As-El), were formed the Latine Sal, Sol, and Salum. Wherever the Amonians found places with these natural or præternatural properties, they held them sacred,
and founded their temples near them. [114]Selenousia, in Ionia, was upon a salt lake, sacred to Artemis. In Epirus was a city called Alesa, Elissa, and Lesa: and hard by were the Alesian plains;
similar to the Elysian in Egypt: in these was produced a great quantity of fossil [115]salt. There was an Alesia in Arcadia, and a mountain Alesium with a temple upon it. Here an antient personage, Æputus, was said to have been suffocated with salt water: in which history there is an allusion to the etymology of the name. It is true that Pausanias supposes it to have been called
Alesia, from Rhea having wandered thither; [116]δια την αλην, ὡς φασι, καλουμενον την
Ῥεας: but it was not αλη, but ἁλας, and ἁλος, sal; and the Deity, to whom that body was sacred, from whence the place was named. And this is certain from another tradition, which there prevailed: for it is said that in antient times there was an eruption of sea water in the temple:
[117]Θαλασσης δε αναφαινεσθαι κυμα εν τῳ Ἱερῳ τουτῳ λογος εστιν αρχαιος. Nor was this appellation confined to one particular sort of fountain, or water: but all waters, that had any uncommon property, were in like manner sacred to Elees, or Eesel. It was an antient title of
Mithras and Osiris in the east, the same as [118]Sol, the Sun. From hence the priests of the Sun were called Soli and Solimi in Cilicia, Selli in Epirus, Salii at Rome, all originally priests of fire. As such they are described by Virgil:
Tum Salii ad cantus incensa altaria circum.
In like manner the Silaceni of the Babylonians were worshippers of the same Deity, and given to the rites of fire, which accompanied the worship of the Sun.
The chief city of Silacena was Sile or Sele, where were eruptions of fire. Sele is the place or city of the Sun. Whenever therefore Sal, or Sel, or the same reversed, occur in the composition of any place's name, we may be pretty certain that the place is remarkable either for its rites or situation,
and attended with some of the circumstances [119]above-mentioned. Many instances may be
produced of those denominated from the quality of their waters. In the river [120]Silarus of Italy
every thing became petrified. The river [121]Silias in India would suffer nothing to swim. The



waters of the [122]Salassi in the Alps were of great use in refining gold. The fountain at
[123]Selinus in Sicily was of a bitter saline taste. Of the salt lake near [124]Selinousia in Ionia I
have spoken. The fountain Siloë at Jerusalem was in some degree [125]salt. Ovid mentions Sulmo,
where he was born, as noted for its [126]cool waters: for cold streams were equally sacred to the Sun as those, which were of a contrary nature. The fine waters at Ænon, where John baptized,
were called [127]Salim. The river Ales near Colophon ran through the grove of Apollo, and was
esteemed the coldest stream in Ionia. [128]Αλης ποταμος ψυχροτατος των εν Ιωνιᾳ. In the
country of the Alazonians was a bitter fountain, which ran into the [129]Hypanis. These terms were sometimes combined with the name of Ham; and expressed Hameles, and Hamelas; contracted to Meles and Melas. A river of this name watered the region of Pamphylia, and was noted for a most
cold and pure [130]water. The Meles near Smyrna was equally admired. [131]Σμυρναιος δε
ποταμος Μελης· ὑδωρ εστι καλλιστον, και σπηλαιον επι ταις πηγαις. The Melas in Cappadocia was of a contrary quality. It ran through a hot, inflammable country, and formed many fiery pools. [132]Και ταυτα δ' εστι τα ἑλη πανταχου πυριληπτα. In Pontus was Amasus,
Amasia, Amasene, where the region abounded with hot waters: [133]Ὑπερκειται δε της των Αμασεων τα τε θερμα ὑδατα των Φαζημονειτων, ὑγιεινα σφοδρα.
It is wonderful, how far the Amonian religion and customs were carried in the first ages. The antient Germans, and Scandinavians, were led by the same principles; and founded their temples in situations of the same nature, as those were, which have been above described. Above all others
they chose those places, where were any nitrous, or saline waters. [134]Maxime autem lucos (or lacus) sale gignendo fæcundos Cœlo propinquare, precesque mortalium nusquam propius audiri firmiter erant persuasi; prout exemplo Hermundurorum docet testis omni exceptione major
[135]Tacitus.
SAN, SON, ZAN, ZAAN.
The most common name for the Sun was San, and Son; expressed also Zan, Zon, and Zaan. Zeus of Crete, who was supposed to have been buried in that Island, is said to have had the following inscription on his tomb:
[136]Ὡδε μεγας κειται Ζαν, ὁν Δια κικλησκουσι.
The Ionians expressed it Ζην, and Ζηνα. Hesychius tells us, that the Sun was called Σαως by the Babylonians. It is to be observed that the Grecians in foreign words continually omitted the Nu final, and substituted a Sigma. The true Babylonish name for the Sun was undoubtedly Σαων,
oftentimes expressed Σωαν, Soan. It was the same as Zauan of the Sidonians; under which name
they worshipped Adonis, or the Sun. Hesychius says, Ζαυανας, θεος τις εν Σιδωνι. Who the Deity was, I think may be plainly seen. It is mentioned by the same writer, that the Indian Hercules, by which is always meant the chief Deity, was styled Dorsanes: Δορσανης ὁ
Ἡρακλης παρ' Ινδοις. The name Dorsanes is an abridgment of Ador-San, or Ador-Sanes, that is Ador-Sol, the lord of light. It was a title conferred upon Ham; and also upon others of his family; whom I have before mentioned to have been collectively called the Baalim. Analogous to this they were likewise called the Zaanim, and Zaananim: and a temple was erected to them by the
antient Canaanites, which was from them named [137]Beth-Zaananim. There was also a place
called Sanim in the same country, rendered Sonam[138], Σωναμ, by Eusebius; which was undoubtedly named in honour of the same persons: for their posterity looked up to them, as the Heliadæ, or descendants of the Sun, and denominated them from that luminary. According to Hesychius it was a title, of old not unknown in Greece; where princes and rulers were styled
Zanides, Ζανιδες, Ἡγεμονες. In [139]Diodorus Siculus mention is made of an antient king of Armenia, called Barsanes; which signifies the offspring of the Sun. We find temples erected to the Deity of the same purport; and styled in the singular Beth-San: by which is meant the temple of the Sun. Two places occur in Scripture of this name: the one in the tribe of Manasseh: the other in the land of the Philistines. The latter seems to have been a city; and also a temple, where the body
of Saul was exposed after his defeat upon mount Gilboa. For it is said, that the Philistines [140]cut off his head, and stripped off his armour—and they put his armour in the house of Ashtoreth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethsan. They seem to have sometimes used this term with a



reduplication: for we read of a city in Canaan called [141]Sansanah; by which is signified a place sacred to the most illustrious Orb of day. Some antient statues near mount Cronius in Elis were by
the natives called Zanes, as we are told by Pausanias: [142]Καλουνται δε ὑπο των επιχωριων
Ζανες. They were supposed to have been the statues of Zeus: but Zan was more properly the Sun; and they were the statues of persons, who were denominated from him. One of these persons, styled Zanes, and Zanim, was Chus: whose posterity sent out large colonies to various parts of the earth. Some of them settled upon the coast of Ausonia, called in later times Italy; where they worshipped their great ancestor under the name of San-Chus. Silius Italicus speaking of the march of some Sabine troops, says,
[143]Pars Sancum voce canebant Auctorem gentis.
Lactantius takes notice of this Deity. [144]Ægyptii Isidem, Mauri Jubam, Macedones CabirumSabini Sancum colunt. He was not unknown at Rome, where they styled him Zeus Pistius, as we learn from Dionysius of Halicarnassus: [145]Εν Ἱερῳ Διος Πιστιου, ὁν Ῥωμαιοι Σαγκον
καλουσι. There are in Gruter inscriptions, wherein he has the title of Semon prefixed, and is also styled Sanctus.
[146]SANCTO. SANCO. SEMONI. DEO. FIDIO. SACRUM.
Semon (Sem-On) signifies Cœlestis Sol.
Some of the antients thought that the soul of man was a divine emanation; a portion of light from the Sun. Hence, probably, it was called Zoan from that luminary; for so we find it named in
Macrobius. [147]Veteres nullum animal sacrum in finibus suis esse patiebantur; sed abigebant ad fines Deorum, quibus sacrum esset: animas vero sacratorum hominum, quos Græci ΖΩΑΝΑΣ vocant Diis debitas æstimabant.
DI, DIO, DIS, DUS.
Another common name for the Deity was Dis, Dus, and the like; analogous to Deus, and Theos of other nations. The Sun was called Arez in the east, and compounded Dis-arez, and Dus-arez;
which signifies Deus Sol. The name is mentioned by Tertullian[148]. Unicuique etiam provinciæ et civitati suus Deus est, ut Syriæ Astarte, Arabiæ Dysares. Hesychius supposes the Deity to have been the same as Dionusus. Δουσαρην τον Διονυσον Ναβαταιοι (καλουσιν), ὡς Ισιδωρος.
There was a high mountain, or promontory, in [149]Arabia, denominated from this Deity:
analogous to which there was one in Thrace, which had its name [150]from Dusorus, or the God of light, Orus. I took notice, that Hercules, or the chief Deity among the Indians, was called
Dorsanes: he had also the name of Sandis, and Sandes; which signifies Sol Deus. [151]Βηλον μεν τον Δια τυχον, Σανδην τε τον Ἡρακλεα, και Αναϊτιδα την Αφροδιτην, και αλλως αλλους εκαλουν. Agathias of the people in the east. Probably the Deity Bendis, whose rites were so celebrated in Phrygia and Thrace, was a compound of Ben-Dis, the offspring of God. The natives of this country represented Bendis as a female; and supposed her to be the same as
[152]Selene, or the moon. The same Deity was often masculine and feminine: what was Dea Luna in one country, was Deus Lunus in another.
KUR, ΚYΡΟΣ, CURA.
The Sun was likewise named Kur, Cur, Κυρος. [153]Κυρον γαρ καλειν Περσας τον Ἡλιον. Many places were sacred to this Deity, and called Cura, Curia, Curopolis, Curene, Cureschata, Curesta, Curestica regio. Many rivers in Persis, Media, Iberia, were denominated in the same manner. The term is sometimes expressed Corus: hence Corusia in Scythia. Of this term I shall say more hereafter.
COHEN, or CAHEN.



Cohen, which seems, among the Egyptians and other Amonians, to have been pronounced Cahen, and Chan, signified a Priest; also a Lord or Prince. In early times the office of a Prince and of a Priest were comprehended under one character.
[154]
Rex Anius, Rex idem hominum, Phœbique Sacerdos.
This continued a great while in some parts of the
[155]
world; especially in Asia Minor, where,
even in the time of the Romans, the chief priest was the prince of the
[156]
province. The term was sometimes used with a greater latitude; and denoted any thing noble and divine. Hence we find it prefixed to the names both of Deities and men; and of places denominated from them. It is often compounded with Athoth, as Canethoth; and we meet with Can-Osiris, Can-ophis, Can-ebron, and the like. It was sometimes expressed Kun, and among the Athenians was the title of the antient priests of Apollo; whose posterity were styled Κυννιδαι, Cunnidæ, according to Hesychius. Κυννιδαι, γενος εν Αθηνῃσιν, εξ ὁυ Ἱερευς του Κυννιου Απολλωνος. We find from hence, that Apollo was styled Κυννιος, Cunnius. Κυννιος, Απολλωνος επιθετον. Hence
came κυνειν, προσκυνειν, προσκυνησις, well known terms of adoration. It was also
expressed Con, as we may infer from the title of the Egyptian Hercules.
[157]
Τον Ἡρακλην φησι κατα την Αιγυπτιων διαλεκτον ΚΩΝΑ λεγεσθαι. It seems also to have been a title of
the true God, who by
[158]
Moses is styled Konah, קנה .
We find this term oftentimes subjoined. The Chaldeans, who were particularly possessed of the land of Ur, and were worshippers of fire, had the name of Urchani. Strabo limits this title to one branch of the Chaldeans, who were literati, and observers of the heavens; and even of these to one sect only. Εστι δε και των Χαλδαιων των Αστρονομικων γενη πλειω· και γαρ
[159]
Ορχηνοι τινες προσαγορευονται. But
[160]
Ptolemy speaks of them more truly as a nation; as does Pliny likewise. He mentions their stopping the course of the Euphrates, and
diverting the stream into the channel of the Tigris.
[161]
Euphratem præclusere Orcheni, &c. nec nisi Pasitigri defertur in mare. There seem to have been particular colleges appropriated to the
astronomers and priests in Chaldea, which were called Conah; as we may infer from
[162]
Ezra. He applies it to societies of his own priests and people; but it was a term borrowed from Chaldea.
The title of Urchan among the Gentile nations was appropriated to the God of fire, and his [163]
priests; but was assumed by other persons. Some of the priests and princes among the Jews, after the return from captivity, took the name of Hyrcanus. Orchan, and Orchanes among the
Persic and Tartar nations is very common at this
[164]
day; among whom the word Chan is ever current for a prince or king. Hence we read of Mangu Chan, Cublai Chan, Cingis Chan. Among some of these nations it is expressed Kon, Kong, and King. Monsieur de Lisle, speaking of the
Chinese, says,
[165]
Les noms de King Che, ou Kong-Sse, signifient Cour de Prince en Chine. Can, ou Chan en langue Tartare signifie Roi, ou Empereur.
PETAH.
Of this Amonian term of honour I have taken notice in a treatise before. I have shewn, that it was
to be found in many Egyptian
[166]
names, such as Petiphra, Petiphera, Petisonius, Petosiris, Petarbemis, Petubastus the Tanite, and Petesuccus, builder of the Labyrinth. Petes, called Peteos
in Homer, the father of Mnestheus, the Athenian, is of the same original:
[167]
Τον γαρ Πετην, τον πατερα Μενεσθεως, του στρατευσαντος εις Τροιαν. φανερως Αιγυπτιον ὑπαρξαντα κτλ. All the great officers of the Babylonians and Persians took their names from
some sacred title of the Sun. Herodotus mentions
[168]
Petazithes Magus, and
[169]
Patiramphes: the latter was charioteer to Xerxes in his expedition to Greece: but he was denominated from another office; for he was brother to Smerdis, and a Magus; which was a priest of the Sun. The term is
sometimes subjoined, as in Atropatia, a province in
[170]
Media; which was so named, as we learn
from Strabo,
[171]
απο του Ατροπατου ἡγεμονος. In the accounts of the Amazons likewise this word occurs. They are said to have been called Aorpata, or, according to the common reading in
Herodotus, Oiorpata; which writer places them upon the Cimmerian Bosporus.
[172]
Τας δε Αμαζονας καλεουσι Σκυθαι Οιορπατα· δυναται δε το ουνομα τουτο κατ' Ἑλλαδα γλωσσαν ανδροκτονοι Οιορ γαρ καλεουσι τον ανδρα, το δε πατα κτεινειν. This etymology is founded upon a notion that the Amazons were a community of women, who killed



every man, with whom they had any commerce, and yet subsisted as a people for ages. I shall hereafter speak of the nations under this title; for there were more than one: but all of one family; all colonies from Egypt. The title above was given them from their worship: for Oiorpata, or, as
some MSS. have it, Aor-pata, is the same as
[173]
Petah Or, the priest of Orus; or, in a more lax sense, the votaries of that God. They were Ανδροκτονοι; for they sacrificed all strangers, whom fortune brought upon their coast: so that the whole Euxine sea, upon which they lived, was rendered infamous from their cruelty: but they did not take their name from this circumstance.
One of the Egyptian Deities was named Neith, and Neit; and analogous to the above her priests
were styled
[174]
Pataneit. They were also named Sonchin, which signifies a priest of the Sun: for Son, San, Zan, are of the same signification; and Son-Chin is Ζανος ἱερευς. Proclus says, that it was the title of the priests; and particularly of him, who presided in the college of Neith at Saïs.
BEL and BAAL.
Bel, Bal, or Baal, is a Babylonish title, appropriated to the Sun; and made use of by the Amonians in other countries; particularly in Syria and Canaan. It signified Κυριος, or Lord, and is often compounded with other terms; as in Bel-Adon, Belorus, Bal-hamon, Belochus, Bel-on; (from which last came Bellona of the Romans) and also Baal-shamaim, the great Lord of the Heavens.
This was a title given by the Syrians to the Sun:
[175]
Τον Ἡλιον Βεελσαμην καλουσιν, ὁ εστι παρα Φοινιξι Κυριος Ουρανου, Ζευς δε παρ' Ἑλλησι. We may, from hence, decypher the name of the Sun, as mentioned before by Damascius, who styles that Deity Bolathes: [176]
Φοινικες και Συροι τον Κρονον Ηλ, και Βηλ, και Βολαθην επονομαζουσι. What he terms Bolathes is a compound of Bal-Ath, or Bal-Athis; the same as Atis, and Atish of Lydia, Persis, and other countries. Philo Biblius interprets it Zeus: Damascius supposed it to mean
Cronus; as did likewise Theophilus:
[177]
Ενιοι μεν σεβονται τον Κρονον, και τουτον αυτον ονομαζουσι Βηλ, και Βαλ, μαλιστα ὁι οικουντες τα ανατολικα κλιματα. This diversity amounts to little: for I shall hereafter shew, that all the Grecian names of Deities, however appropriated, were originally titles of one God, and related to the Sun.
KEREN.
Keren signifies, in its original sense, a horn: but was always esteemed an emblem of power; and made use of as a title of sovereignty and puissance. Hence, it is common with the sacred writers to
say
[178]
My horn shalt thou exalt
[179]
his horn shall be exalted with honour
[180]
the horn of
Moab is cut off: and the Evangelist
[181]
speaks of Christ as a horn of salvation to the world. The Greeks often changed the nu final into sigma: hence, from keren they formed κερας, κερατος:
and from thence they deduced the words κρατος, κρατερος: also κοιρανος, κρεων, and
καρηνον; all relating to strength and eminence. Gerenius, Γερηνιος, applied to Nestor, is an Amonian term, and signifies a princely and venerable person. The Egyptian Crane, for its great services, was held in high honour, being sacred to the God of light, Abis ( אב אש ) or, as the Greeks expressed it, Ibis; from whence the name was given. It was also called Keren and Kerenus: by the Greeks Γερανος, the noble bird, being most honoured of any. It was a title of the Sun himself: for
Apollo was named Craneüs, and
[182]
Carneüs; which was no other than Cereneüs, the supreme Deity, the Lord of light: and his festival styled Carnea, Καρνεια, was an abbreviation of
Κερενεια, Cerenea. The priest of Cybele in Phrygia was styled Carnas; which was a title of the Deity, whom he served; and of the same purport as Carneus above.
OPH.
Oph signifies a serpent, and was pronounced at times and expressed, Ope,
[183]
Oupis, Opis, Ops;
and, by Cicero,
[184]
Upis. It was an emblem of the Sun; and also of time and eternity. It was worshipped as a Deity, and esteemed the same as Osiris; by others the same as Vulcan. Vulcanus
Ægyptiis Opas dictus est, eodem Cicerone
[185]
teste. A serpent was also, in the Egyptian language, styled Ob, or Aub: though it may possibly be only a variation of the term above. We are
told by Orus Apollo, that the basilisk, or royal serpent, was named Oubaios:
[186]
Ουβαιος, ὁ εστιν Ἑλληνιστι Βασιλισκος. It should have been rendered Ουβος, Oubus; for Ουβαιος is a



possessive, and not a proper name. The Deity, so denominated, was esteemed prophetic; and his
temples were applied to as oracular. This idolatry is alluded to by Moses,
[187]
who, in the name of God, forbids the Israelites ever to inquire of those dæmons, Ob and Ideone: which shews that it was of great antiquity. The symbolical worship of the serpent was, in the first ages, very
extensive; and was introduced into all the mysteries, wherever celebrated:
[188]
Παρα παντι των νομιζομενων παρ' ὑμιν Θεων ΟΦΙΣ συμβολον μεγα και μυστηριον αναγραφεται. It is remarkable, that wherever the Amonians founded any places of worship, and introduced their rites, there was generally some story of a serpent. There was a legend about a serpent at Colchis, at Thebes, and at Delphi; likewise in other places. The Greeks called Apollo himself Python, which is the same as Opis, Oupis, and Oub. The woman at Endor, who had a familiar spirit, is
called
[189]
אוב , Oub, or Ob; and it is interpreted Pythonissa. The place where she resided, seems to have been named from the worship there instituted: for Endor is compounded of En-Ador, and signifies Fons Pythonis, the fountain of light, the oracle of the God Ador. This oracle was, probably, founded by the Canaanites; and had never been totally suppressed. In antient times they had no images in their temples, but, in lieu of them, used conical stones or pillars, called Βαιτυλια; under which representation this Deity was often worshipped. His pillar was also called [190]
Abaddir, which should be expressed Abadir, being a compound of Ab, אוב , and Adir; and means the serpent Deity, Addir, the same as Adorus. It was also compounded with On, a title of the same Deity: and Kircher says that Obion is still, among the people of Egypt, the name of a serpent. אוב , Ob Mosi, Python, vox ab Ægyptiis sumpta; quibus Obion hodieque serpentem sonat.
Ita
[191]
Kircher. The same also occurs in the Coptic lexicon. The worship of the serpent was very
antient among the Greeks, and is said to have been introduced by Cecrops.
[192]
Philochorus Saturno, et Opi, primam in Atticâ statuisse aram Cecropem dicit. But though some represent Opis
as a distinct Deity; yet
[193]
others introduce the term rather as a title, and refer it to more Deities than one: Callimachus, who expresses it Oupis, confers it upon Diana, and plays upon the sacred term:
[194]
Ουπι, ανασσ' ευωπι.
It is often compounded with Chan; and expressed Canopus, Canophis, Canuphis, Cnuphis, Cneph: it is also otherwise combined; as in Ophon, Ophion, Oropus, Orobus, Inopus, Asopus, Elopus, Ophitis, Onuphis, Ophel. From Caneph the Grecians formed Cyniphius, which they used for an epithet to Ammon:
[195]
Non hic Cyniphius canetur Ammon, Mitratum caput elevans arenis.
On the subject of serpent worship I shall speak more at large in a particular treatise.
AIN.
Ain, An, En, for so it is at times expressed, signifies a fountain, and was prefixed to the names of many places which were situated near fountains, and were denominated from them. In Canaan, near the fords of Jordan, were some celebrated waters; which, from their name, appear to have
been, of old, sacred to the Sun. The name of the place was
[196]
Ænon, or the fountain of the Sun; the same to which people resorted to be baptized by John: not from an opinion that there was any sanctity in the waters; for that notion had been for ages obliterated; and the name was given by the
Canaanite: but
[197]
John baptized in Ænon, near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. Many places were styled An-ait, An-abor, Anabouria, Anathon, Anopus, Anorus. Some of these were so called from their situation; others from the worship there established. The Egyptians had many subordinate Deities, which they esteemed so many emanations, αποῤῥοιαι from their chief God; as we learn from Iamblichus, Psellus, and
Porphyry. These derivatives they called
[198]
fountains, and supposed them to be derived from the Sun; whom they looked upon as the source of all things. Hence they formed Ath-El and Ath-Ain,
the
[199]
Athela and Athena of the Greeks. These were two titles appropriated to the same personage, Divine Wisdom; who was supposed to spring from the head of her father. Wherever the Amonian religion was propagated, names of this sort will occur; being originally given from
the mode of worship established
[200]
. Hence so many places styled Anthedon, Anthemus, Ainshemesh, and the like. The nymph Œnone was, in reality, a fountain, Ain-On, in Phrygia; and sacred to the same Deity: and, agreeably to this, she is said to have been the daughter of the river



[201]Cebrenus. The island Ægina was named [202]Œnone, and Œnopia, probably from its worship. As Divine Wisdom was sometimes expressed Ath-Ain, or Αθηνα; so, at other times, the terms were reversed, and a Deity constituted called An-Ait. Temples to this goddess occur at Ecbatana in Media: also in Mesopotamia, Persis, Armenia, and Cappadocia; where the rites of fire were particularly observed. She was not unknown among the antient Canaanites; for a temple called
Beth-Anath is mentioned in the book of [203]Joshua. Of these temples, and the Puratheia there established, accounts may be seen in many parts of Strabo.
I have mentioned, that all springs and baths were sacred to the Sun: on which account they were called Bal-ain; the fountains of the great Lord of Heaven; from whence the Greeks formed Βαλανεια: and the Romans Balnea. The southern seas abounded formerly with large whales: and it is well known, that they have apertures near their nostrils, through which they spout water in a large stream, and to a great height. Hence they too had the name of Bal-Ain, or Balænæ. For every thing uncommon was by the Amonians consecrated to the Deity, and denominated from his titles. This is very apparent in all the animals of Egypt.
The term Ουρανος, Ouranus, related properly to the orb of the Sun; but was in aftertimes made to comprehend the whole expanse of the heavens. It is compounded of Ourain, the fountain of Orus; and shews to what it alludes, by its etymology. Many places were named Ees-ain, the reverse of Ain-ees, or Hanes: and others farther compounded Am-ees-ain, and Cam-ees-ain, rendered Amisene, and Camisene: the natural histories of which places will generally authenticate the etymology. The Amonians settled upon the Tiber: and the antient town Janiculum was
originally named [204]Camese; and the region about it Camesene: undoubtedly from the fountain
Camesene, called afterward Anna Perenna, whose waters ran into the sacred pool [205]Numicius: and whose priests were the Camœnæ.
I am sensible, that some very learned men do not quite approve of terms being thus reversed, as I have exhibited them in Ath-ain, Bal-ain, Our-ain, Cam-ain, and in other examples: and it is esteemed a deviation from the common usage in the Hebrew language; where the governing word, as it is termed, always comes first. Of this there are many instances; such as Ain-Shemesh, AinGaddi, Ain-Mishpat, Ain-Rogel, &c. also Beth-El, Beth-Dagon, Beth-Aven, Beth-Oron. But, with submission, this does not affect the etymologies, which I have laid before the reader: for I do not deduce them from the Hebrew. And though there may have been of old a great similitude between that language, and those of Egypt, Cutha, and Canaan: yet they were all different tongues. There
was once but one language among the sons of men[206]. Upon the dispersion of mankind, this was branched out into dialects; and those again were subdivided: all which varied every age, not only in respect to one another; but each language differed from itself more and more continually. It is therefore impossible to reduce the whole of these to the mode, and standard of any one. Besides, the terms, of which I suppose these names to be formed, are not properly in regimine; but are used adjectively, as is common almost in every language. We meet in the Grecian writings with [207]Ἑλληνα στρατον, Ἑλλαδα διαλεκτον, εσβεσεν Ἑλλαδα φωνην. Also νασον Σικελαν, γυναικα μαζον, Περσην στρατον, ναυτην δρομον, Σκυθην οιμον. Why may we not suppose, that the same usage prevailed in Cutha, and in Egypt? And this practice was not entirely foreign to the Hebrews. We read indeed of Beer-sheba, Beer-lahoiroi, &c. but we also
read of [208] Baalath-Beer, exactly similar to the instances which I have produced. We meet in the sacred writings with Beth-El, and Beth-Dagon: but we sometimes find the governing word
postponed, as in Elizabeth, or temple of Eliza. It was a Canaanitish[209] name, the same as Elisa, Eleusa, Elasa of Greece and other countries. It was a compound of El-Ees, and related to the God of light, as I have before shewn. It was made a feminine in aftertimes: and was a name assumed by women of the country styled Phenicia, as well as by those of Carthage. Hence Dido has this as
a secondary appellation; and mention is made by the Poet of Dii morientis [210]Elizæ, though it was properly the name of a Deity. It may be said, that these names are foreign to the Hebrews, though sometimes adopted by them: and I readily grant it; for it is the whole, that I contend for. All, that I want to have allowed, is, that different nations in their several tongues had different modes of collocation and expression: because I think it as unreasonable to determine the usage of the Egyptians and antient Chaldeans by the method of the Hebrews, as it would be to reduce the Hebrew to the mode and standard of Egypt. What in Joshua, c. 19. v. 8. is Baaleth, is, 1 Kings, c. 16. v. 31. Eth-baal: so that even in the sacred writings we find terms of this sort transposed. But in respect to foreign names, especially of places, there are numberless instances similar to those, which I have produced. They occur in all histories of countries both antient and modern. We read
of Pharbeth, and Phainobeth in Egypt: of Themiskir, and [211]Tigranocerta, which signifies



Tigranes' city, in Cappadocia, and Armenia. Among the eastern nations at this day the names of the principal places are of this manner of construction; such as Pharsabad, Jehenabad, Amenabad: such also Indostan, Pharsistan, Mogulistan, with many others. Hence I hope, if I meet with a temple or city, called Hanes, or Urania, I may venture to derive it from An-Eees, or Ur-Ain, however the terms may be disposed. And I may proceed farther to suppose that it was denominated the fountain of light; as I am able to support my etymology by the history of the place. Or if I should meet with a country called Azania, I may in like manner derive it from AzAn, a fountain sacred to the Sun; from whence the country was named. And I may suppose this fountain to have been sacred to the God of light, on account of some real, or imputed, quality in its waters: especially if I have any history to support my etymology. As there was a region named Azania in Arcadia, the reader may judge of my interpretation by the account given of the
excellence of its waters.
[212]
Αζανια, μερος της Αρκαδιας—εστι κρηνη της Αζανιας, ἡ τους γευσαμενους του ὑδατος ποιει μηδε την οσμην του οινου ανεχεσθαι. Hanes in
[213]
Egypt was the reverse of Azan; formed however of the same terms, and of the same purport precisely.
In respect to this city it may be objected, that if it had signified, what I suppose, we should have found it in the sacred text, instead of חנס , expressed עין אש . If this were true, we must be obliged to suppose, whenever the sacred writers found a foreign name, composed of terms not unlike some in their own language, that they formed them according to their own mode of expression, and reduced them to the Hebrew orthography. In short, if the etymology of an Egyptian or Syriac name could be possibly obtained in their own language, that they had always an eye to such etymology; and rendered the word precisely according to the Hebrew manner of writing and pronunciation. But this cannot be allowed. We cannot suppose the sacred writers to have been so unnecessarily scrupulous. As far as I can judge, they appear to have acted in a manner quite the reverse. They seem to have laid down an excellent rule, which would have been attended with great utility, had it been universally followed: this was, of exhibiting every name, as it was expressed at the time when they wrote, and by the people, to whom they addressed themselves. If this people, through length of time, did not keep up to the original etymology in their pronunciation, it was unnecessary for the sacred Penmen to maintain it in their writings. They wrote to be understood: but would have defeated their own purpose, if they had called things by names, which no longer existed. If length of time had introduced any variations, those changes
were attended to: what was called Shechem by Moses, is termed
[214]
Σιχαρ or Συχαρ by the
[215]
Apostle.
APHA, APHTHA, PTHA, PTHAS.
Fire, and likewise the God of fire, was by the Amonians styled Apthas, and Aptha; contracted, and by different authors expressed, Apha, Pthas, and Ptha. He is by Suidas supposed to have been the Vulcan of Memphis. Φθας, ὁ Ηφαιστος παρα
[216]
Μεμφιταις. And Cicero makes him the
same Deity of the Romans.
[217]
Secundus, (Vulcanus) Nilo natus, Phas, ut Ægyptii appellant, quem custodem esse Ægypti volunt. The author of the Clementines describes him much to the
same purpose.
[218]
Αιγυπτιοι δε ὁμοιως—το πυρ ιδιᾳ διαλεκτῳ Φθα εκαλεσαν, ὁ ἑρμηνευεται Ἡφαιστος.
[219]
Huetius takes notice of the different ways in which this name is expressed: Vulcano Pthas, et Apthas nomen fuisse scribit Suidas. Narrat Eusebius Ptha Ægyptiorum eundem esse ac Vulcanum Græcorum; Patrem illi fuisse Cnef, rerum opificem. However the Greeks and Romans may have appropriated the term, it was, properly, a title of [220]
Amon: and Iamblichus acknowledges as much in a
[221]
chapter wherein he particularly treats of him. But, at the same time, it related to fire: and every place, in the composition of whose name it is found, will have a reference to that element, or to its worship.
There was a place called Aphytis in Thrace, where the Amonians settled very early; and where
was an oracular temple of Amon.
[222]
Αφυτη, η Αφυτις, πολις προς τῃ Παλληνῃ Θρᾳκης, απο Αφυος τινος εγχωριου. Εσχε δε ἡ πολις μαντειον του Αμμωνος. Aphyte, or Aphytis, is a city hard by Pallene, in Thrace; so called from one Aphys, a native of those parts. This city had once an oracular temple of Ammon.
It stood in the very country called Phlegra, where the worship of fire once particularly prevailed. There was a city Aphace; also a temple of that name in Mount Libanus, sacred to Venus Aphacitis, and denominated from fire. Here, too, was an oracle: for most temples of old were
supposed to be oracular. It is described by Zosimus, who says,
[223]
that near the temple was a



large lake, made by art, in shape like a star. About the building, and in the neighbouring ground, there at times appeared a fire of a globular figure, which burned like a lamp. It generally shewed itself at times when a celebrity was held: and, he adds, that even in his time it was frequently seen.
All the Deities of Greece were αποσπασματα, or derivatives, formed from the titles of Amon, and Orus, the Sun. Many of them betray this in their secondary appellations: for, we read not only
of Vulcan, but of Diana being called
[224]
Apha, and Aphæa; and in Crete Dictynna had the same
name: Hesychius observes, Αφαια, ἡ Δικτυννα. Castor and Pollux were styled
[225]
Αφετηριοι:
and Mars
[226]
Aphæus was worshipped in Arcadia. Apollo was likewise called
[227]
Αφητωρ: but it was properly the place of worship; though Hesychius otherwise explains it. Aphetor was what
the antient Dorians expressed Apha-Tor, a
[228]
fire tower, or Prutaneum; the same which the Latines called of old Pur-tor, of the like signification. This, in aftertimes, was rendered Prætorium: and the chief persons, who officiated, Prætores. They were originally priests of fire; and, for that
reason, were called
[229]
Aphetæ: and every Prætor had a brazier of live coals carried before him, as a badge of his office.
AST, ASTA, ESTA, HESTIA.
Ast, Asta, Esta, signified fire; and also the Deity of that element. The Greeks expressed it Ἑστια, and the Romans, Vesta. Plutarch, speaking of the sacred water of Numicius being discovered by
the priestesses of this Deity, calls them the virgins of
[230]
Hestia. Esta and Asta signified also a sacred hearth. In early times every district was divided according to the number of the sacred hearths; each of which constituted a community, or parish. They were, in different parts, styled
Puratheia, Empureia, Prutaneia, and Prætoria: also
[231]
Phratriai, and Apaturia: but the most common name was Asta.
These were all places of general rendezvous for people of the same community. Here were kept up perpetual fires: and places of this sort were made use of for courts of judicature, where the laws of the country, θεμισται, were explained, and enforced. Hence Homer speaking of a person not
worthy of the rights of society, calls him
[232]
Αφρητωρ, αθεμιστος, ανεστιος.
The names of these buildings were given to them from the rites there practised; all which related to fire. The term Asta was in aftertimes by the Greeks expressed, Αστυ, Astu; and appropriated to
a city. The name of Athens was at first
[233]
Astu; and then Athenæ of the same purport: for Athenæ is a compound of Ath-En, Ignis fons; in which name there is a reference both to the guardian Goddess of the city; and also to the perpetual fire preserved within its precincts. The God of fire, Hephaistus, was an Egyptian compound of Apha-Astus, rendered by the Ionian Greeks Hephæstus.
The
[234]
Camœnæ of Latium, who were supposed to have shewn the sacred fountain to the Vestals, were probably the original priestesses, whose business it was to fetch water for lustrations from that stream. For Cam-Ain is the fountain of the Sun: and the Camœnæ were named from their attendance upon that Deity. The Hymns in the temples of this God were sung by these women: hence the Camœnæ were made presidents of music.
Many regions, where the rites of fire were kept up, will be found to have been named Asta,
Hestia, Hestiæa, Hephæstia; or to have had cities so
[235]
called. This will appear from the histories of Thessaly, Lycia, Egypt, Lemnos; as well as from other countries.
From Asta and Esta come the terms Æstas, Æstus, Æstuo, Αστυ, Ἑστια, Ἑστιαζειν.
SHEM, SHAMEN, SHEMESH.
Shem, and Shamesh, are terms, which relate to the heavens, and to the Sun, similar to שמש שמיס שום , of the Hebrews. Many places of reputed sanctity, such as Same, Samos, Samothrace, Samorna, were denominated from it. Philo Biblius informs us, that the Syrians, and Canaanites, lifted up their hands to Baal-Samen, the Lord of Heaven; under which title they honoured the Sun: [236]
Τας χειρας ορεγειν εις ουρανους προς τον Ἡλιον· τουτον γαρ, φησι, θεον ενομιζον μονον ΟΥΡΑΝΟΥ ΚYΡΙΟΝ ΒΑΑΛ-ΣΑΜΗΝ καλουντες. Ephesus was a place
of great sanctity: and its original name was
[237]
Samorna; which seems to be a compound of Sam



Oran, Cœlestis Sol, fons Lucis. We read of Samicon in Elis, [238]χωριον Σαμικον, with a sacred
cavern: and of a town called [239]Samia, which lay above it. The word Σεμνος was a contraction
of Semanos, from Sema-on; and properly signified divine and celestial. Hence σεμναι θεαι,
σεμνη κορα. Antient Syria was particularly devoted to the worship of the Sun, and of the Heavens; and it was by the natives called Shems and Shams: which undoubtedly means the land
of Shemesh, from the worship there followed. It retains the name at this [240]day. In Canaan was a town and temple, called Beth-Shemesh. What some expressed Shem and Sham, the Lubim seem to have pronounced Zam: hence the capital of Numidia was named Zama, and Zamana, from
Shamen, Cœlestis. This we may learn from an inscription in [241]Reineccius.
JULIO. PROCULO. PRÆF. URB. PATRONO. COL. BYZACENÆ. ET. PA TRONO. COLON. ÆLIÆ.
[242]ZAMANÆ. REGIÆ.
Ham being the Apollo of the east, was worshipped as the Sun; and was also called Sham and Shem. This has been the cause of much perplexity, and mistake: for by these means many of his posterity have been referred to a wrong line, and reputed the sons of Shem; the title of one brother not being distinguished from the real name of the other. Hence the Chaldeans have by some been
adjudged to the line of [243]Shem: and Amalek, together with the people of that name, have been placed to the same account. His genealogy is accordingly represented by Ebn Patric. He makes
him the son of Aad, and great grandson of Shem. [244]Fuitque Aad filius Arami, filius Shemi,
filius Noæ. The author of the Chronicon Paschale speaks of [245]Chus, as of the line of Shem: and
Theophilus in his treatise to Autolycus does the same by [246]Mizraïm. Others go farther, and add
Canaan to the [247]number. Now these are confessedly the immediate sons of [248]Ham: so that we may understand, who was properly alluded to in these passages under the name of Shem.
MACAR.
This was a sacred title given by the Amonians to their Gods; which often occurs in the Orphic hymns, when any Deity is invoked.
[249]Κλυθι, Μακαρ Παιαν, τιτυοκτονε, Φοιβε Λυκωρευ.
[250]Κλυθι, Μακαρ, πανδερκες εχων αιωνιον ομμα.
Many people assumed to themselves this title; and were styled [251]Μακαρες, or Macarians: and various colonies were supposed to have been led by an imaginary personage, Macar, or
[252]Macareus. In consequence of this, we find that the most antient name of many cities and
islands was Macra, Macris, and [253]Macaria. The Grecians supposed the term Macar to signify happy; whence Μακαρες θεοι was interpreted ευδαιμονες: but whether this was the original purport of the word may be difficult to determine. It is certain that it was a favourite term; and many places of sanctity were denominated from it. Macar, as a person, was by some esteemed the
offspring of [254]Lycaon; by others, the son of [255]Æolus. Diodorus Siculus calls him
[256]Macareus, and speaks of him as the son of Jupiter. This term is often found compounded
Macar-On: from whence people were denominated Μακαρωνες, and [257]Μακρωνες; and
places were called Μακρων. This, probably, was the original of the name given to islands which
were styled Μακαρων νησοι. They were to be found in the Pontus Euxinus, as well as in the
Atlantic. The Acropolis of Thebes in Bœotia was, in like manner, called [258]Μακαρων νησος. It was certainly an Amonian sacred term. The inland city, Oäsis, stood in an Egyptian province,
which had the [259]same name: so that the meaning must not be sought for in Greece. This term was sometimes expressed as a feminine, Macris, and Macra: and by the Grecians was interpreted longa; as if it related to extent. It was certainly an antient word, and related to their theology; but was grown so obsolete that the original purport could not be retrieved. I think we may be assured that it had no relation to length. Eubœa was, of old, called Macris; and may be looked upon as comparatively long: but Icarus, Rhodes, and Chios, were likewise called so; and they did not



project in length more than the islands in their [260]neighbourhood. They were, therefore, not denominated from their figure. There was a cavern in the Acropolis of Athens, which was called Macrai, according to Euripides.
[261]Προσβοῤῥον αντρον, ἁς Μακρας κικλησκομεν.
The same author shews, manifestly, that it was a proper name; and that the place itself was styled Macrai. This was a contraction for Macar-Ai, or the place of Macar:
[262]Μακραι δε χωρος εστ' εκει κεκλημενος.
All these places were, for a religious reason, so denominated from Macar, a title of the Deity.
MELECH.
Melech, or, as it is sometimes expressed, Malech, and Moloch, betokens a king; as does Malecha a queen. It was a title, of old, given to many Deities in Greece; but, in after times, grew obsolete and misunderstood: whence it was often changed to μειλιχος, and μειλιχιος, which signified
the gentle, sweet, and benign Deity. Pausanias tells us that Jupiter was styled Μειλιχιος, both in
[263]Attica and at [264]Argos: and, in another part of his work, he speaks of this Deity under the
same title, in company with Artemis at Sicyon. [265]Εστι δε Ζευς Μειλιχιος, και Αρτεμις
ονομαζομενη Πατρῳα. He mentions that they were both of great antiquity, placed in the temple before the introduction of images: for, the one was represented by a pyramid, and the other by a bare pillar: Πυραμιδι δε ὁ Μειλιχιος, ἡδε κιονι εστιν εικασμενη. He also speaks of some unknown Gods at Myonia in Locris, called Θεοι Μειλιχιοι; and of an altar, with an
inscription of the same purport, [266]βωμος Θεων Μειλιχιων.
Rivers often had the name of Melech. There was one in Babylonia, generally expressed Nahar Malcha, or the royal stream: these too were often by the Grecians changed to Μειλιχοι. The
foregoing writer gives an instance in a [267]river of Achaia. Malaga in Spain was properly
Malacha, the royal city. I take the name of Amalek to have been Ham [268]Melech abbreviated: a title taken by the Amalekites from the head of their family. In like manner I imagine
[269]Malchom, the God of the Sidonians, to have been a contraction of Malech-Chom, βασιλευς
Ἡλιος: a title given to the Sun; but conferred also upon the chief of the Amonian [270]family.
ANAC.
Anac was a title of high antiquity, and seems to have been originally appropriated to persons of great strength, and stature. Such people in the plural were styled Anakim; and one family of them
were to be found at [271]Kirjath-Arba. Some of them were likewise among the Caphtorim, who settled in Palestina. Pausanias represents Asterion, whose tomb is said to have been discovered in
Lydia, as a son of Anac, and of an enormous size. [272]Ειναι δε Αστεριον μεν Ανακτος· Ανακτα δε Γης παιδα—οστα εφανη το σχημα περιεχοντα ες πιστιν, ὡς εστιν ανθρωπου· επει δια μεγεθος ουκ εστιν ὁπως αν εδοξεν. We may from hence perceive that the history of the Anakim was not totally obliterated among the Grecians. Some of their Deities were styled ανακτε, others ανακτορες, and their temples ανακτορια. Michael Psellus speaking of heresies, mentions, that some people were so debased, as to worship Satanaki: [273]Αυτον δε μονον επιγειον Σατανακι ενστερνιζονται. Satanaki seems to be Satan Anac, διαβολος βασιλευς.
Necho, Nacho, Necus, Negus, which in the Egyptian and Ethiopic languages signified a king, probably was an abbreviation of Anaco, and Anachus. It was sometimes expressed Nachi, and Nacchi. The buildings represented at Persepolis are said to be the work of Nacki Rustan; which signifies the lord, or prince Rustan.
ZAR, and SAR.



Sar is a rock, and made use of to signify a promontory. As temples were particularly erected upon such places, these eminences were often denominated Sar-On, from the Deity, to whom the temples were sacred. The term Sar was oftentimes used as a mark of high honour. The Psalmist
repeatedly addresses God as his Rock, [274]the Rock of his refuge; the Rock of his salvation. It is also used without a metaphor, for a title of respect: but it seems then to have been differently expressed. The sacred writers call that lordly people the Sidonians, as well as those of Tyre,
[275]Sarim. The name of Sarah was given to the wife of Abraham by way of eminence; and
signifies a [276]lady, or princess. It is continually to be found in the composition of names, which relate to places, or persons, esteemed sacred by the Amonians. We read of Serapis, Serapion, Serapammon: also of Sarchon, and Sardon; which is a contraction for Sar-Adon. In Tobit mention
is made of [277]Sarchedonus; the same name as the former, but with the eastern aspirate. The
Sarim in Esther are taken notice of as persons of high [278]honour: the same dignity seems to have
been known among the Philistim, by whom it was rendered [279]Sarna, or Sarana: hence came the
[280]Tyrian word Sarranus for any thing noble and splendid. In the prophet Jeremiah are enumerated the titles of the chief princes, who attended Nebuchadnezzar in his expedition against
Judea. Among others he mentions the [281]Sarsechim. This is a plural, compounded of Sar, and Sech, rendered also Shec, a prince or governor. Sar-Sechim signifies the chief of the princes and rulers. Rabshekah is nearly of the same purport: it signifies the great prince; as by Rabsares is
meant the chief [282]Eunuch; by Rabmag, the chief of the Magi. Many places in Syria and Canaan have the term Sar in composition; such as Sarabetha, Sariphæa, Sareptha. Sardis, the capital of Crœsus, was the city of Sar-Ades, the same as Atis, the Deity of the country.
High [283]groves, or rather hills with woods of antient oaks, were named Saron; because they were sacred to the Deity so called. Pliny takes notice of the Saronian bay near Corinth, and of the oaks
which grew near it. [284]Portus Cœnitis, Sinus Saronicus olim querno nemore redimitus; unde nomen. Both the oaks and the place were denominated from the Deity Sar-On, and Chan-Ait, by the Greeks rendered Σαρων, and Κοινειτις, which are titles of nearly the same purport. Saron
was undoubtedly an antient God in Greece. [285]Lilius Gyraldus styles him Deus Marinus; but he
was, properly, the Sun. Diana, the sister of Apollo, is named [286]Saronia: and there were Saronia
sacra, together with a festival at [287]Trœzen; in which place Orus was supposed to have been
born. [288]Ωρον γενεσθαι σφισιν εν γῃ πρωτον. Orus was the same as Sar-On, the Lord of
light. [289]Rocks were called Saronides, from having temples and towers sacred to this Deity: just as groves of oaks were, of which I took notice above. This interpretation is given by
[290]Hesychius; and by the Scholiast, upon the following verse of Callimachus:
[291]Η πολλας ὑπενερθε Σαρωνιδας ὑγρος Ιαων Ηειρεν.
As oaks were styled Saronides, so likewise were the antient Druids, by whom the oak was held so
sacred. Hence Diodorus Siculus, speaking of the priests of Gaul, styles them [292]Φιλοσοφοι,
θεολογοι—περιττως τιμωμενοι, ὁυς ΣΑΡΩΝΙΔΑΣ ονομαζουσι. This is one proof, out of many, how far the Amonian religion was extended; and how little we know of Druidical worship, either in respect to its essence or its origin.
UCH.
Uch, Υκ, expressed also Ach, Och, Οχα, was a term of honour among the Babylonians, and the rest of the progeny of Chus; and occurs continually in the names of men and places which have
any connection with their history. I have shewn, in a former [293]treatise, that the shepherds who ruled in Egypt were of that race, and that they came from Babylonia and Chaldea. Eusebius
informs us, that their national title was [294]Υκουσος; or, as it was undoubtedly expressed by the
people themselves, Υκκουσος, Uc-Cusus. It is a term taken notice of by Apion and Manethon, and they speak of it as a word in the sacred language of the country, which signified a king: [295]Υκ καθ' ἱεραν γλωσσαν βασιλεα σημαινει. I wonder that this word has been passed over with so little notice; as it is of great antiquity; and, at the same time, of much importance in respect to etymology. Uc-Cusus signified the royal, or noble, Cusean: and, as it was a word in the sacred language of Egypt, we may from hence learn what that language was; and be assured that it



was the primitive language of Chus, the same as the antient Chaldaïc. It was introduced among the Mizraïm by the Auritæ, or Cuthites, together with their rites and religion: hence it obtained the
name of the sacred language. Diodorus Siculus affords [296]evidence to the same purpose: and it is farther proved by Heliodorus; who says that the sacred characters of Egypt and those of the
Cuthites in Ethiopia were the [297]same. This term occurs very often among the titles of which the Babylonish names arc composed; such as Ochus and Belochus. Among the Egyptians it is to be found in Acherez and Achencherez; which are the names of two very antient princes. Acherez is a compound of Ach-Ares, Magnus Sol; equivalent to Achorus, another name of the same Deity,
assumed in like manner by their kings. The latter was sometimes expressed [298]Achor, Achoris. Ochuras, Uchoreus; which are all the same name, diversified in different ages and by different writers. As priests took the titles of the Deities whom they served, Lucan has, very properly, introduced a priest of Egypt under the name of Achoreus:
[299]quos inter Achoreus, Jam placidus senio, fractisque modestior annis.
The name of Osiris seems to have been Uc-Sehor, and Uc-Sehoris. According to Hellanicus, if a person had in Egypt made inquiry about the term Osiris, he would not have been understood: for
the true name was [300]Usiris. Philo Biblius, from Sanchoniathon, calls the same Deity [301]Isiris; and adds, that he was the brother of Cna, or Canaan; and the inventor of three letters. Ισιρις, των
τριων γραμματων ἑυρετης, αδελφος Χνα του Φοινικος. I take Isiris and Usiris, as well as Osiris, to be all Uc-Sehoris softened, and accommodated to the ears of Greece.
The Sun was styled El-Uc, which the Grecians changed to Λυκος, Lucos; as we learn from
[302]Macrobius. He was also styled El-Uc-Or, which was changed to Λυκωρευς; and El-Uc-Aon,
rendered Lycaon[303], Λυκαων. As this personage was the same as El-Uc, Λυκος, it was fabled of him that he was turned into a wolf. The cause of this absurd notion arose from hence: every sacred animal in Egypt was distinguished by some title of the Deity. But the Greeks never considered whether the term was to be taken in its primary, or in its secondary acceptation; whence they referred the history to an animal, when it related to the God from whom the animal was denominated. Λυκος, Lucos, was, as I have shewn, the name of the Sun: hence, wherever this term occurs in composition, there will be commonly found some reference to that Deity, or to
his substitute Apollo. We read of [304]Λυκιου Απολλωνος ἱερον: of [305]Lycorus, a supposed
son of Apollo: of [306]Lycomedes, another son: of [307]Lycosura, the first city which the Sun
beheld. The people of Delphi were, of old, called [308]Lycorians: and the summit of Parnassus,
[309]Lycorea. Near it was a [310]town of the same name; and both were sacred to the God of light. From Lucos, in this sense, came lux, luceo, lucidus, and Jupiter Lucetius, of the Latines; and λυχνος, λυχνια, λυχνευω, of the Greeks; also Λυκαβας, and αμφιλυκος, though differently
expressed. Hence it was that so many places sacred to Apollo were styled Leuce, Leuca, Λυκια, Leucas, Leucate.
Mox et Leucatæ nimbosa cacumina montis,
Et formidatus nautis aperitur [311]Apollo.
Hence also inscriptions [312]DEO LEUCANIÆ: which term seems to denote, Sol-Fons, the fountain of day. The name Lycophron, Λυκοφρων, which some would derive from Λυκος, a wolf, signifies a person of an enlightened mind. Groves were held very sacred: hence lucus, which some would absurdly derive a non lucendo, was so named from the Deity there worshipped: as was Ἁιμος, a word of the same purport among the Greeks.
This people, who received their theology from Egypt and Syria, often suppressed the leading vowel; and thought to atone for it by giving a new termination: though to say the truth, this mode of abbreviation is often to be observed in the original language, from whence these terms are derived. Κυρος, the name of Cyrus, seems to have suffered an abridgment of this nature. It was probably a compound of Uch-Ur, the same as Achor, and Achorus of Egypt, the great luminary, the Sun. In antient times all kings, priests, and people of consequence took to themselves some sacred title. But as Aneith was abbreviated to Neith, Acherez to Cherez; so Achorus was rendered
Chorus, Curus. Thus far is manifest, that Curus signified the Sun. [313]Ὁ μεν ουν Κυρος απο Κυρου του παλαιου ονομα εσχεν· εκεινῳ δε απο του Ἡλιου γενεσθαι φασι· Κυρον



γαρ καλειν Περσας τον Ἡλιον. Ctesias likewise informs us that the name of Cyrus had this
signification. [314]Και τιθεται το ονομα αυτου απο του Ἡλιου: He was denominated Cyrus from the Sun, which was so called. It was the same as Orus: and according to Strabo it is sometimes so expressed; as we may infer from a river of this name, of which he says,
[315]Εκαλειτο δε προτερον Κορος. We find it sometimes rendered Κυρις, Curis: but still with
a reference to the Sun, the Adonis of the east. Hesychius explains Κυρις, ὁ Αδωνις. In Phocis
was [316]Κυῤῥα, Currha, where Apollo Κυῤῥαιος was honoured; which names were more
commonly expressed Κιῤῥα and Κιῤῥαιος. The people of Cyrene are said by Palæphatus to have been originally Ethiopians or Cuthites. They, as well as the Egyptians, worshipped the Sun under
the title of Achur, and Achor: and like them esteemed him the [317]Θεος απομυιος. From the God Achur we may infer that their country was at first called Acurana; which is a compound of Achur-Ain, and betokens the great fountain of light. Acurana was abbreviated to Curane and Curene; but was always supposed to relate to the Sun, and Heaven. Hence the Greeks, who out of every obsolete term formed personages, supposed Cyrene to have been the daughter of the
supreme Deity. [318]Κυρηνη, πολις Λιβυης, απο Κυρηνης της Ὑψεως. The city Cyrene in Libya was denominated from Cyrene, the daughter of the most High. There was a fountain here of
great sanctity, which was in like manner denominated from the Sun. It was called [319]Κυρη
πηγη, which terms are equivalent to Kur-Ain, and Achurain of the Amonians, and signify the fountain of the Sun. Pliny proves, that this was the purport of the terms, when he describes this
part of the world. [320]Cyrenaïca, eadem Tripolitana regio, illustratur Hammonis oraculo—et
Fonte Solis. The like account is to be found in Pomponius Mela[321]. Ammonis oraculum, fidei
inclytæ; et fons, quem Solis [322]appellant. As Achor was a term, which related to the Sun; we find it often compounded with Ων, On, another name of that Deity; from whence was formed Acharon. This was the true name of the city in Palestine, called in Scripture, according to our
version, [323]Ekron. It was denominated from Achor, the God of flies, worshipped also under the name of Baal-zebub with the same attribute. The Caphtorim brought the worship of this God from Egypt; where was a river called Acharon; so denominated from the Deity of the country. This river, and the rites practised in its vicinity, are mentioned in a beautiful fragment from some Sibylline poetry, but when, or by whom composed, is uncertain. The verses are taken notice of by Clemens Alexandrinus, and what is remarkable, are certainly quoted long before the completion of what is portended. However the purport may perhaps be looked upon rather as a menace, than a prophecy.
[324]Ισι, θεα, τριταλαινα, μενεις επι χευμασι Νειλου, Μουνη, μαινας, αοιδος, επι ψαμαθοις Αχεροντος.
The Deity was likewise called Achad, and Achon: and many cities and countries were hence
[325]denominated. Acon in Palestine is said to have been so named in honour of Hercules, the
chief Deity in those [326]parts.
I have mentioned, that Ham, styled also Cham, was looked up to as the Sun, and worshipped by his posterity. Hence both his images and priests were styled Chamin: and many princes assumed this title, just as they did that of Orus, and Arez. His posterity esteemed themselves of the Solar race, by way of eminence: and the great founder of the Persic Monarchy was styled Achamin, rendered by the Greeks Αχαιμενης, Achæmenes: and all of his family afterwards had the title of
Αχαιμενιοι, and Αχαιμενιδαι, from the same pretensions. They all of them universally esteemed themselves the children of the Sun; though they were likewise so called from their worship. Hence Lutatius Placidus in his Scholia upon Statius interprets the word Achæmenidæ by
[327]Solis Cultores. This may serve to authenticate my etymology, and shew, that the term is derived from Cham, the Sun: but the purport of it was generally more limited, and the title confined to the royal race of the Persians, who were looked upon as the offspring of the Sun. The Cuthites of Ethiopia Africana had the same high opinion of themselves: hence Calasiris in
Heliodorus invokes the Sun as his great ancestor. [328]Επικεκλησθω μαρτυς ὁ Γεναρχης
ἡμων Ἡλιος· and Chariclea in another place makes use of a like invocation: [329]Ἡλιε,
Γεναρχα προγονων ἡμων. O, Sun, the great source of my ancestry. The Amonians, who
settled at Rhodes, styled themselves Ἡλιαδαι, the Solar [330]race. Those who settled upon the
Padus did the [331]same. Hyde mentions a people in Diarbeker, called [332]Chamsi; and says, that



the meaning of the word is Solares; and the same in purport as Shemsi and Shamsi of the Arabians.
The term Υκ, of which I have been treating, was obsolete, and scarce known in the times when Greece most flourished: yet some traces of it may be found, though strangely perverted from its original meaning. For the writers of this nation, not knowing the purport of the words, which they found in their antient hymns, changed them to something similar in sound; and thus retained them with a degree of religious, but blind reverence. I have shewn, that of El-Uc they formed Λυκος, Lucus, which was acknowledged to be the name of the Sun: of El-Uc-Aon, Lycaon: of El-Uc-Or, Lycorus, and Lycoreus:
[333]Η κιθαριν, η τοξα Λυκωρεος εντεα Φοιβου.
So from Uc-Ait, another title of the God, they formed Hecatus, and a feminine, Hecate. Hence Nicander speaks of Apollo by this title:
[334]Εζομενος τριποδεσσι παρα Κλαριοις Ἑκατοιο.
And Herophile the Sibyl of the same Deity:
[335]Μοιραν εχουσ' Ἑκατῳ της τοτ' Ανακτοριης.
The only person who seems knowingly to have retained this word, and to have used it out of
composition, is [336]Homer. He had been in Egypt; and was an admirer of the theology of that
nation. He adhered to antient [337]terms with a degree of enthusiasm; and introduced them at all hazards, though he many times did not know their meaning. This word, among others, he has preserved; and he makes use of it adverbially in its proper sense, when he describes any body superlatively great, and excellent. Thus he speaks of Calchas as far superior to every body else in prophetic knowledge, and styles him οχ' αριστος:
[338]Καλχας Θεστοριδης οιωνοπολων οχ' αριστος, Ὁς ῃδη τα τ' εοντα, τα τ' εσσομενα, προ τ' εοντα.
So on the Trojan side Helenus is spoken of in the same light:
[339]Πριαμιδης Ἑλενος οιωνοπολων οχ' αριστος.
So [340]Φωκηων οχ' αριστον, [341]Αιτωλων οχ' αριστος, and [342]Τυχιος—Σκυτοτομων οχ' αριστος.
In these and in all other instances of this term occurring in Homer, it is observable, that it is always in the same acceptation, and uniformly precedes the same word, αριστος. It is indeed to
be found in the poetry ascribed to [343]Orpheus: but as those verses are manifestly imitations of Homer, we must not look upon it as a current term of the times, when that poetry was composed: nor was it ever, I believe, in common use, not even in the age of Homer. It was an Amonian term, joined inseparably with another borrowed from the same people. For αριστος was from Egypt, and Chaldea. Indeed, most of the irregular degrees of comparison are from that quarter; being derived from the Sun, the great Deity of the Pagan world, and from his titles and properties. Both αρειων and αριστος were from αρης, the Arez of the east. From Bel, and Baaltis, came
βελτιων, and βελτιστος: αμεινων is an inflection from Amon. From the God Aloeus came λωιος, λωιτερος, and λωιστος: from κερεν changed to κερας, κερατος, were formed κρεσσων, κρεισσων, κρατερος, and κρατιστος.
PHI.
Phi signifies a mouth; also language, and speech. It is used by the Amonians particularly for the voice and oracle of any God; and subjoined to the name of that Deity. The chief oracle in the first ages was that of Ham, who was worshipped as the Sun, and styled El, and Or. Hence these oracles are in consequence called Amphi, Omphi, Alphi, Elphi, Urphi, Orphi. It is made to signify, in the
book of [344]Genesis, the voice, or command of Pharaoh. From Phi, in this acceptation, came



φημι, φημη, φημυς, φασκω, φατις, fama, fari,—ita farier infit. I imagine that the term Pharaoh itself is compounded of Phi-Ourah, Vox Ori, sive Dei. It was no unusual thing among the antients to call the words of their prince the voice of God. Josephus informs us, that it signified a
king: [345]Ὁ Φαραων παρ' Αιγυπτιοις βασιλεα σημαινει: and Ouro in the Copto-Arabic Onomasticon is said to signify the same: but I should think, that this was only a secondary acceptation of the original term.
Phi is also used for any opening or cavity: whence we find the head of a fountain often denominated from it; at least the place, whence the fountain issued forth, or where it lost itself. And as all streams were sacred, and all cavities in the earth looked upon with a religious horror, the Amonians called them Phi-El, Phi-Ainon, Phi-Anes; rendered by the Greeks Phiale, Phænon, Phanes, Phaneas, Paneas. The chief fountain of the river Jordan lost itself underground, and rose
again at some miles distance. It sunk at Phiale, and rose again at [346]Paneas. Pliny speaks of a
place of this sort at [347]Memphis, called Phiala; and, as he imagines, from its figure: but it was undoubtedly a covert aquæduct, by which some branch of the river was carried. The Nile itself is
said to be lost underground, near its fountains; and that place also was called Phiala. [348]Phialam appellari fontem ejus, mergique in cuniculos ipsum amnem. There was also a fountain of this
name at [349]Constantinople. Sometimes it occurs without the aspirate, as in Pella, a city of
Palestine, named, undoubtedly, from its fountains: for Pliny calls it Pellam aquis [350]divitem.
Mines were held sacred; and, like fountains, were denominated from Ænon, and Hanes, those titles of the Sun. In Arabia, near Petra, was a mine, worked by condemned persons, which was
named [351]Phinon, and Phænon. Epiphanius mentions [352]Φανησια μεταλλα, or the mines of Hanes; to which Meletius, a bishop of the Thebaïs, was condemned.
AI.
Ai, and Aia, signifies a district or province; and, as most provinces in Egypt were insular, it is often taken for an island. In other parts it was of much the same purport as αια of the Greeks, and
betokened any [353]region or country. It was from hence that so many places have been represented by the Greeks as plurals, and are found to terminate in ai; such as Athenai, Thebai, Pherai, Patrai, Amyclai, Therapnai, Clazomenai, Celænai. There are others in eia; as Chæroneia, Coroneia, Eleia. In others it was rendered short; as in Oropia, Ellopia, Ortygia, Olympia, Æthiopia, Scythia, Cænia, Icaria. It is likewise found expressed by a single letter, and still subjoined to the proper name: hence we meet with Ætna, Arbela, Larissa, Roma, Himera, Hemera,
Nusa, Nyssa, Patara, Arena, [354]Cabasa, and the like. We may from hence prove, and from innumerable other instances, that among the people of the east, as well as among other nations, the word in regimine was often final. Thus the land of Ion was termed Ionia; that of Babylon, Babylonia; from Assur came Assyria; from Ind, India; from Lud, Ludia; in all which the region is
specified by the termination. To say Lydia tellus, Assyria tellus, is in reality [355]redundant. In the name of Egypt this term preceded, that country being styled Ai-Gupt, Αιγυπτος, the land of the Gupti, called afterwards Cupti, and Copti.
C N P.
As to the common names, which are found combined with additional terms, in order to denote the nature and situation of places; they are, for the most part, similar to those in the antient Chaldaic, and admit of little variation.
Air is a city; often expressed Ar, and Ara. Hence Arachosia, Arachotus, Aracynthus, Arambis, Aramatha (Ar-Ham-aith), Archile, Arzilla, Arthedon: all which were cities, or else regions denominated from them.
Kir, Caer, Kiriath, are words of the like purport. We read in the Scriptures of Kiriath Sepher, Kiriath Arba, Kiriath Jearim. It was in some parts pronounced Kirtha, and Cartha. Melicartus, the Hercules of the Phenicians and Cretans, was, properly, Melech-Carta, the Deity of the place. The city of Tigranes, in Armenia, was called Tigranocerta. One name of Carthage was Καρχηδων, from Car-Chadon, the same as Adon. It was also called Carthada, from Cartha-Ada, the city of the queen or Goddess, who was by the Romans supposed to be Juno, but was, properly, the Amonian Elisa. Caer, among many antient nations, signified a city, or fortress; as we may learn from the places called Carteia, Carnaim, Caronium, Caroura, Carambis. Among the Britons were, of old,



places exactly analogous; such as Caerlisle, Caerdiff, Caerphilly, Caernarvon, and Caeruriah in Cornwall.
Kir and Caer are the same term, differently expressed. In Scripture we meet with Kir Haresh, and Kir-Hareseth. Isaiah. c. 16. v. 7. and v. 11. and Kir Moab, c. 15. v. 1. and Kir Heres, of the same purport as Kir Haresh, is mentioned by Jeremiah, c. 48. v. 31. Upon the Euphrates was Cercusium
and Carchemish. In Cyprus was Kironia, rendered Κερωνια by [356]Ptolemy; whose true name was Kir-On, the city of the Sun; where was a temple to Our-Ain, styled Urania. Kir-On was often
rendered Cironis, Coronis; and the Deity Coronus and [357]Cronus. By these means the place was substituted for the Deity, and made an object of worship. Of this abuse I shall often speak. Artemis was, properly, a city, Ar-Themis, the same as Thamuz of Egypt. What was called Artemis, and Artemisium, was in some places reversed, and expressed by Kir subjoined: hence Themiscir, and Themiscura in Pontus.
Col, Cal, Calah, Calach, signify properly an eminence, like the Collis of the Romans; but are often used for a fortress so situated. We sometimes meet with a place styled absolute Calah: but the term is generally used in composition, as Cala Nechus, Cala-Anac, Cala-Chan, Cala-On, Cala-Es, Cala-Ait, Cala-Ur, Cala-Ope, Cala-Ham, Cala-Amon, Cala-Adon: whence came the names of
people and places styled [358]Callinicus, Calachene, [359]Colonæ, Cales, Calathe, Calistæ,
Calathusa, Calauria, Coloriua, Caliope, Calama, Calamos, [360]Calamon, Calymna, Calydnus, Calycadnus; all which were places in Phrygia, Bithynia, Assyria, Libya, denominated from their situation and worship.
Comah is used for a wall; but seems to be sometimes taken for those sacred inclosures wherein they had their Puratheia; and particularly for the sacred mount which stood in those inclosures. From Comah came the Greek χωμα, a round hill or mound of earth; called also Taph and ταφος; and thence often mistaken for a tomb: but it was originally a high altar.
By Gib is meant a hill. Gibeon was the hill of the Sun; said to be famous for its springs. Gibethon is a compound of Gib-Ethon, or Ath-On, titles of the same Deity. Nadab, the son of Jeroboam,
was slain by Baasha, at Gibethon, of the [361]Philistines.
Har and Hor signify a mountain; ορος of the Greeks.
Tin seems to have signified a sacred place, for sacrifice; a kind of high altar. The Greeks generally expressed it, in composition, Τις· hence we read of Opheltis, Altis, Baaltis, Abantis, Absyrtis. It was in use among the antient Hetrurians and other nations: hence came the terms Aventinus,
Palatinus, [362]Numantinus, &c. It seems to be the same as Tan in the east, which occurs continually in composition, as in Indos-tan, Mogolis-tan, Pharsis-tan, Chusis-tan.
Tor is a hill or tower. Many places in Greece had it in their composition; such as Torone, Torete,
Toreate: also in Hetrurïa, Torchonium. Turzon, in Africa, was a tower of the [363]Sun. It was sometimes expressed Tar; hence Tarcunia, Taracena, Tarracon in Spain, Tarne (Tar-ain) which gave name to a fountain in Lydia; Taron (Tar-On) in Mauritania. Towers of old were either Prutaneia, or light-houses, and were styled Tor-Is: whence came the Turris of the Romans. Sometimes these terms were reversed, and the tower was called Astur. Such a one was near some hot streams, at no great distance from Cicero's Villa. It is thus described by Plutarch: Αστυρα
χωριον παραλιον Κικερωνος. The river, too, was called Astura. There was also a place of this name opposite to the island Lesbos, undoubtedly denominated from the like circumstances in its situation; as may be learned from Pausanias, who had seen it. Ὑδωρ δε απο πηγων ανερχομενον μελαν ιδων οιδα εν Αστυροις· ταδε Αστυρα απαντικρυ εστι Λεσβου· λουτρα εστι θερμα εν τῳ Αταρνει καλουμενῳ.
Caph, Cap, and Cephas, signify a rock; and also any promontory or headland. As temples used to be built upon eminences of this sort; we find this word often compounded with the titles of the Deity there worshipped, as Caph-El, Caph-El-On, Caph-Aur, Caph-Arez, Caph-Is, Caph-Is-Ain, Caph-Ait; whence came Cephale, Cephalonia, Caphareus, Capisa, Cephisus, Capissene, Cephene, Caphyatæ, Capatiani. In Iberia was a wonderful edifice upon the river Bœtis, mentioned by Strabo, and called Turris Capionis. It was a Pharos, dedicated, as all such buildings were, to the Sun: hence it was named Cap-Eon, Petra Solis. It seems to have been a marvellous structure. Places of this sort, which had towers upon them, were called Caphtor. Such an one was in Egypt,
or in its [364]vicinity; whence the Caphtorim had their name. It was probably near [365]Pelusium, which they quitted very early for the land of Canaan.



Diu sometimes, but sparingly, occurs for an island; and is generally by the Greeks changed to Dia, Δια. The purport of it may be proved from its being uniformly adapted to the same object. The
Scholiast upon Theocritus takes notice that the island Naxos was called Dia:
[366]
Διαν την νυν καλουμενην Ναξον; and he adds, πολλαι δε και ἑτεραι εισι νησοι Διαι καλουμεναι, ἡτε προ της Κρητης—και ἡ περι Μηλον, και ἡ περι Αμοργον, και ἡ της Κεω χεῤῥονησος, και ἡ Πελοποννησου. All these were islands, or peninsula regions.
BETH.
Beth is a house or temple; as in
[367]
Beth-El, Beth-Dagon, Beth-Shemesh, Beth-Oron, or Beth-OrOn, &c. &c. It is sometimes subjoined, as in Phar-beth, and Elisa-beth; the latter of which is the
house of
[368]
Elisa, the same as Elusa of Idume, and Eleusa of Egypt. Beth was in different countries expressed Bat, Bad, Abad. Hence we meet at this day with Pharsabad, Astrabad, Amenabad, Moustafabad, Iahenabad in Persia, India, and other parts of the east. Balbec in Syria is
supposed to be the same as Balbeth, the temple of Bal, or the Sun. There are, says
[369]
Dr. Pocock, many cities in Syria, that retain their antient names. Of this Balbeck, or rather Balbeit, is an instance; which signifies the house or temple of Baal. Gulielmus Tyrius, so called from being
bishop of Tyre, who wrote of the Holy war, alludes to Baalbec, under the name of
[370]
Balbeth. He lived in the eleventh century, and died anno 1127. According to Iablonsky, Bec and Beth are of the same meaning. Atarbec in Egypt is the temple of Atar or Athar; called Atarbechis by [371]
Herodotus. The same is Athyr-bet, and styled Athribites (Αθρειβιτης) by
[372]
Strabo. The
inner recess of a temple is by Phavorinus and Hesychius called Βαιτης, Βετης, Βετις, similar to בית אש among the Chaldeans. It was the crypta or sacred place, where of old the everlasting fire was preserved. Hesychius observes, Βετης, το αποκρυφον μερος του Ἱερου. Bet-Is signifies the place of fire.
It is said of Horapollo by Suidas, that he was a native of Phainubuth in Egypt, belonging to the nome of Panopolis: Ὡραπολλων Φαινυβυθεως κωμης του Πανοπολιτου Νομου. Phainubuth is only Phainabeth varied, and signifies the place sacred to Phanes; which was one of the most antient titles of the Deity in Egypt. So Pharbeth was an abbreviation of Pharabeth, or the house of Pharaoh.
GAU, expressed CAU, CA, and CO.
Gau likewise is a term which signifies a house; as we learn from Plutarch. The great and decisive battle between Alexander and Darius is generally said to have been fought at Arbela. But we are
assured by this writer, that it was decided at Gaugamela
[373]
. He says, that Gau signified in the language of the country a house: and that the purport of the word Gaugamela was the house of a camel. This name, it seems, was given to the town on account of a tribute exacted for the maintenance of a camel, which had saved the life of some king, when he fled from battle: and the reason why the victory of Alexander was adjudged to Arbela, arose from its being more famous than the other place: for Gaugamela was not of sufficient repute: therefore the honour of this victory was given to Arbela, though it was according to some five hundred, according to others
six hundred stadia
[374]
from the field of battle. I have not now time, nor is it to my purpose, to enter into a thorough discussion of this point: I will only mention it as my opinion, that Arbela
and Gaugamela were the same place. The king alluded to is said by
[375]
Strabo to have been Darius the son of Hystaspes. But is it credible, that so great a prince, who had horses of the famous breed of Nysa, as well as those of Persis and Arabia, the most fleet of their kind, should be so circumstanced in battle, as to be forced to mount a camel, that could scarce move six miles in an hour: and this at a time when the greatest dispatch was necessary? This author gives a different reason for the place being thus denominated. He says, that it was allotted for the maintenance of a camel, which used to bring the king's provisions from Scythia, but was tired and failed upon the road. I know not which of the two circumstances in this short detail is most exceptionable; a king of Persia's provisions being brought to Babylon, or Sushan from Scythia; or a tired camel having such a pension. The truth is this: the Grecians misinterpreted the name, and then forged these
legendary stories to support their
[376]
mistake. Had they understood the term, they would have been consistent in their history. Gau, and, as it was at times expressed, Cau, certainly signifies a house, or temple: also a cave, or hollow; near which the temple of the Deity was founded. For the Amonians erected most of their sacred edifices near caverns, and deep openings of the earth.



Gaugamela was not the house of a camel, as Plutarch and Strabo would persuade us, notwithstanding the stories alleged in support of the notion: but it was the house and temple of Cam-El, the Deity of the country. Arbela was a place sacred to Bel, called Arbel, אור בל of the
Chaldeans. It was the same as Beth Arbel of
[377]
Hosea: and Gaugamela is of the same purport, relating to the same God under different titles. The Grecians were grossly ignorant in respect to foreign events, as Strabo repeatedly confesses: and other writers do not scruple to own it. Lysimachus had been an attendant upon Alexander during the whole series of his conquests in Asia: there had been nothing of moment transacted, in the success of which he had not partaken. Yet even in his days, when he was king of Thrace, the accounts of those great actions had been so misrepresented, that when a history of them was read in his presence, they seemed quite new to him. It is all very fine, says the prince; but where was I when all this happened? There was a series of events exhibited, with which the person most interested was least acquainted. We may then well imagine, that there existed in the time of Plutarch many mistakes, both in respect to the
geography of countries very remote, and to the
[378]
language of nations, with whom the Romans were little acquainted. The great battle, of which we have been speaking, was confessedly fought at Gaugamela. Ptolemy Ceraunus, who was present, averred it: as did Aristobulus: and it has been recorded by Plutarch and others. It is also adjudged to Arbela by persons of equal credit: and it must certainly have been really there transacted: for notwithstanding the palliating excuse of Plutarch, it is utterly incredible in respect to so great a victory, that the scene of action should be determined by this place, if it were sixty, or, as some say, seventy miles out of the way. But in reality it was at no such distance. Diodorus Siculus says, that Alexander immediately after the victory attacked Arbela, and took it: and found in it many evidences of its being a place of
consequence.
[379]
Θαψας τους τετελευτηκοτας επεβαλε τοις Αρβηλοις, και πολλην μεν ἑυρεν αφθονιαν της τροφης, ουκ ολιγον δε κοσμον, και γαζαν βαρβαρικην, αργυριου δε ταλαντα δισχιλια. The battle was fought so near the city, that Alexander was afraid of some contagion from the dead bodies of the enemy, which lay close by it in great abundance.
I have mentioned, that Gaugamela was the temple of Cham-El, or Cham-Il. This was a title of the Deity brought from Chaldea to Egypt; and from thence to Greece, Hetruria, and other regions. The Greeks, out of different titles, and combinations, formed various Deities; and then invented different degrees of relation, which they supposed to have subsisted between them. According to
Acusilaus Cham-Il was the Son of Vulcan, and Cabeira.
[380]
Ακουσιλαος δε ὁ Αργειος εκ Καβειρης και Ἡφαιστου Καμιλον λεγει. He was, by others, rendered Camillus, whose
attendants were the Camilli; and he was esteemed the same as Hermes of Egypt.
[381]
Statius Tullianus de vocabulis rerum libro primo ait dixisse Callimachum, Tuscos Camillum appellare Mercurium, &c. Romani quoque pueros et puellas nobiles et investes Camillos et Camillas appellant, Flaminicarum et Flaminum præministros. Servius speaks to the same purpose. [382]
Mercurius Hetruscâ linguâ Camillus dicitur. The reason of the attendants being also called Camilli was in consequence of a custom among the antients of conferring generally upon the priests the title of the Deity whom they served. The Camilli were commonly young persons of good family, as we learn from Plutarch, and were to be found in the temples of Jupiter, or Zeus:
for Zeus and Hermes were originally the same:
[383]
Και τον ὑπηρετουντα τῳ Ἱερῳ του Διος αμφιθαλη παιδα λεγεσθαι Καμιλλον, ᾡς και τον Ἑρμην· ὁυτως ενιοι των Ἑλληνων Καμιλλον απο της διακονιας προσηγορευον. He mentions Ἑρμην—Καμιλλον απο της διακονιας, and supposes that Camillus had the name of Hermes from the similarity of his office, which was waiting upon the Gods. But the Chaldeans and Egyptians, from whom these titles were borrowed, esteemed Hermes as the chief Deity, the same as Zeus, Bel, and Adon. They knew nothing of Mercurius pedissequus, nor Hermes the lacky. They styled their chief God Cam-Il, or Camillus, and his priests had the same title. He did not borrow it from them; but they received it from him. The name is sometimes expressed Camulus: and the Amonians, who travelled westward, brought his rites and worship into the western parts of Europe: hence there are
inscriptions to be found inscribed
[384]
Camulo Sancto Fortissimo. He was sometimes taken for Mars: as we may learn from an inscription in Gruter:
[385]
MARTI CAMULO Ob Salutem Tiberi Claud. Cæs. Cives Remi posuerunt.
Such is the history of this Deity; whose worship was better known in the more early ages; and whose temple was styled Gau-Camel, by the Greeks rendered Gaugamela. I make no doubt but



that Arbela was the same place: for places had as many names as the Deity worshipped had titles.
Arbela was probably the city, and Gaugamela the
[386]
temple; both sacred to the same Deity, under different names.
It is remarkable that Syncellus, speaking of Venephres, King of Egypt, says, that he built the
pyramids of
[387]
Co-Chone; which are the principal pyramids of that country. Eusebius before him
had taken notice of the same history:
[388]
Ουενεφρης, εφ' ὁυ ὁ λιμος κατεσχε την χωραν, ὁς και τας Πυραμιδας περι Κοχωνην ηγειρεν. Venephres was a prince, in whose time happened a famine in the land of Egypt. He was the same, who built the Pyramids about Cochone. Now Co-Chone, analogous to Beth-El, Beth-Shan, Beth-Dagon, signifies the temple of the Deity; the house of the great king, or ruler: for such is the purport of Con, and Conah. Hercules, the chief
Deity of Tyre, and who was also highly reverenced in Egypt, was Styled Con.
[389]
Τον Ἡρακλην φησι κατα την Αιγυπτιων διαλεκτον Κωνα λεγεσθαι. From hence we find, that it was a sacred Egyptian title. According to some readings the place is expressed Cocome; which is of the same purport. Co-Chome, the same as Cau-Come, signifies the house of Chom, or the Sun; and seems to betray the purpose for which the chief pyramid was erected: for it was
undoubtedly nothing else but a monument to the Deity, whose name it bore. According to
[390]
Herodotus the great pyramid was built by Cheops; whom others called Chaops. But Chaops is a similar compound; being made up of the terms Cha-Ops, and signifies οικος Πυθωνος, domus Opis Serpentis. It was the name of the pyramid, which was erected to the Sun, the Ophite Deity of Egypt, worshipped under the symbol of a serpent. Analogous to Cau-Come in Egypt was a place
in Ethiopia, called
[391]
Cuscha: doubtless so named from Chus, the great ancestor from whom the Ethiopians were descended.
The Sun was styled by the Amonians, among other titles, Zan; as I have before shewn: and he was worshipped under this denomination all over Syria and Mesopotamia; especially at Emesa, Edessa, and Heliopolis. One region was named Gauzanitis, from a city Gauzan, the Gosan of the [392]
Scriptures. Strabo calls it
[393]
Χαζηνη, Cha-Zene, and places it near Adiabene. Gauzan, or Go-zan, is literally the house of the Sun. I once thought that the land of Goshen, in Egypt, was of
the same purport as Cushan; and have so mentioned it in a former
[394]
treatise. So far is true: the land of Goshen was the land of Cushan, and possessed by the sons of Chus: but the two terms are not of the same meaning. Goshen, or Goshan, like Gauzan in Mesopotamia, signifies the temple of the Sun: hence it was as a city, rendered by the Greeks Heliopolis. Artapanus, as we learn from Eusebius, expresses it Caisan, Καισαν. Go-Shan, Gau Zan, Caisan, Cazena, all denote a place sacred to the Sun; and are such variations in rendering the same term, as must be expected in an interval of fifteen hundred years, and from different transcribers. This luminary was also called Abor, the parent of light; and his temple Cha-Abor, and Cho-Abor, contracted Chabor and Chobar. Of this name both a city and river were to be found in Gauzanitis; as well as in Susiana, and other parts: for rivers often took their names from some temple, or city, by which they ran. The temple at Dodona was, of old, called Cha-On, or house of the Sun; as we may infer from the country having the name of Chaonia; for Chaonia is the land of Chaon. The priests and inhabitants were
called
[395]
Chaones, from their place of worship: and the former had also the name
[396]
of Selli, which signifies the priests of the Sun. In Arcadia, near the eruption of the river Erasinus, was a
mountain, clothed with beautiful trees, and sacred to Dionusus. This, also, was called
[397]
Chaon, the place of the Sun; and was, undoubtedly, so named from the antient worship; for Dionusus was,
of old, esteemed the same as Osiris, the Sun. There was also a place called
[398]
Chaon in Media and Syria; Chaonitis in Mesopotamia: and in all these places the same worship prevailed. So Caballis, the city of the Solymi, was named from Ca-bal, the place of the god Bal, or Baal. It is mentioned by Strabo. In like manner Caballion, in Gallia Narbonensis, is a compound of CaAbelion, a well known Deity, whose name is made up of titles of the Sun. The priests of this place
were styled
[399]
Salies; the region was called Χαουαρα; undoubtedly from Cha-Our ( אור ), some temple of Ur, erected by the Amonians, who here settled. Canoubis in Egypt was a compound of Ca-Noubis; Cabasa, in the same country, Ca-Basa; called by many Besa, the Beseth of the
Scriptures, a Goddess well known in Egypt. She had a temple in Canaan, called
[400]
Beth Besa.
Cuamon, near Esdraelon, is a compound of Cu-Amon, the place or house of Amon:
[401]
ἑως του Κυαμωνος. There was a temple in Attica called Cuamites; and a personage denominated from it. The history of the place, and the rites, in time grew obsolete; and Pausanias supposes that the
name was given from Κυαμος, Cuamos, a bean.
[402]
Σαφες δε ουδεν εχω λεγειν, ειτε πρωτος Κυαμους εσπειρεν ὁυτος. I have not authority for the supposition, but it seems



probable that this temple was erected to the memory of some person who first sowed beans. And here it is proper to take notice of a circumstance of which I must continually put the reader in mind, as it is of great consequence towards decyphering the mythology of antient times. The Grecians often mistook the place of worship for the Deity worshipped: so that the names of many Gods are, in reality, the names of temples where they were adored. Artemis was Ar-Temis, the city of Themis, or Thamis; the Thamuz of Sidon and Egypt. This the Greeks expressed Αρτεμις; and made it the name of a Goddess. Kir-On was the city and temple of the Sun, in Cyprus and other places. They changed this to Kironus, which they contracted Cronus; and out of it made a particular God. From Cha-Opis they formed a king Cheops; from Cayster, the same as Ca Aster, they fancied a hero, Caystrius; from Cu-Bela, Cybele; from Cu-Baba, Cybebe. Cerberus, the dog
of hell, was denominated from Kir-Abor; as I shall hereafter [403]shew.
I have mentioned Caucon, or Caucone, in Egypt: there was a place of the same name in Greece. It was, originally, sacred to the Sun; and the priests and inhabitants were called Cancones. Instead of
Con, which signifies the great Lord, the Greeks substituted a hero [404]Caucon, who was supposed to have first introduced those Orgies practised by the Messenians. It was, properly, a temple of the Sun; and there was another of the same name in Bithynia, and from thence the country was called Cauconia. I shall hereafter treat at large of Cuthite colonies, which went abroad and settled in different parts. One of the first operations when they came on shore was to build temples, and to found cities, in memory of their principal ancestors, who, in process of time, were worshipped as
Deities. A colony of this people settled at Colchis, which they called Cutaia[405], from the head of their family, styled both Chus and Cuth. We may infer, that they built a temple which was called Ca-Cuta; and from which the region was also denominated: for it is certain that it has that name at
this [406]day. Cocutus, which we render Cocytus, was undoubtedly a temple in Egypt. It gave name to a stream, on which it stood; and which was also called the Charonian branch of the Nile, and the river Acheron. It was a foul canal, near the place of Sepulture, opposite to Memphis, and not far from Cochone. Cocutus was the temple of Cutus, or Cuth; for he was so called by many of his posterity. A temple of the same was to be found in Epirus, upon a river Cocutus. Here was also a river Acheron, and a lake Acherusia: for a colony from Egypt settled here; and the stream was of as foul a nature as that near Memphis. [407]Ῥει δε και Κωκυτος ὑδωρ ατερπεστατον.
Juno is by Varro styled Covella. [408]Dies quinque te kalo, Juno Covella; Juno Covella, dies septem te kalo. Here, as in many instances, the place of worship is taken for the person, to whom the worship is directed. Covella is only a variation for Cou-El, or Co-El, the house or region of the Deity, and signifies heavenly. It is accordingly by Varro interpreted Urania, Ουρανια: whence Juno Covella must be rendered Cœlestis. From the substantive, Cou-El, the Romans formed Coel, heaven; in aftertimes expressed Coelus, and Cœlum. I say, in aftertimes: for they originally called it Co-el, and Co-il, and then contracted it to Cœl. Hence Ausonius in his Grammaticomastix mentions a passage to this purpose.
Unde Rudinus ait Divôm domus altisonum Cœl: or as Ennius, to whom he alludes, has rendered
it, according to the present MSS. altisonum [409]Coil. He sometimes subjoins the Latine termination:
Coilum prospexit stellis fulgentibus aptum. Olim de Coilo laivum dedit inclytus signum. Saturnus, quem Coilus genuit. Unus erit, quem tu tollas in Coirila Coili Templa.
Cœlus in aftertimes was made a Deity: hence there are inscriptions dedicated [410]Cœlo Æterno.
The antient Deity Celeus, mentioned by [411]Athenagoras, and said to have been worshipped at Athens, was the same as the above.
Many places and regions, held sacred, and called Coel by the Amonians, were by the Greeks rendered κοιλα, cava. Hence we read of Κοιλη Λακεδαιμων, Κοιλε Ηλις, and the like. Syria
was by them styled Κοιλη, the hollow: but the true name was Coëla, the heavenly or sacred. It was so denominated from the Cuthites, who settled there, on account of the religion established. Hence it was also named Shem, and Shama; which are terms of like purport, and signify divine, or
heavenly. It is a name, which it retains at this day; as we are informed by [412]Abulfeda, and others. Elis Coela was the most sacred part of Greece; especially the regions of Olympia, Cauconia, and Azania. It was denominated Elis from Ηλ, Eel, the Sun: and what the Greeks



rendered Κοιλη of old meant [413]heavenly. Hence Homer styleth it peculiarly [414]Ηλιδα διαν, Elis the sacred. As Coele Syria was styled Sham, and Sama; so we find places, which have a
reference to this term, in Elis. A town of great antiquity was named [415]Samicon, which signifies Cœli Dominus. Here was also a temple of Poseidon Samius, surrounded with a grove of olives; and there were festivals observed, which were called Samia. There was likewise of old a city named Sama, or Samos: which Strabo imagines, might have been so named from its high
situation: for high places were called [416]Samia. It certainly signifies in some degree high; but the true meaning of Sama was heavenly, similar to Sam, Sham, Shamem, of the eastern nations. Hence Same, Samos, Samothrace, Samacon, were denominated on account of their sanctity. Strabo supposes, that the city Samos in Elis was situated in the Samian plain: it therefore could not well have this name from its high situation. It is moreover inconsistent to suppose regions called κοιλα, or cava, to have been denominated from Sama, high. In short both terms have been mistaken: and Coilus in the original acceptation certainly signified heavenly: whence we read in Hesychius, as also in Suidas, Κοιολης, ὁ Ἱερευς. By which we learn, that by Coioles was meant a sacred or heavenly person; in other words, a priest of Cœlus. In Coioles there is but a small variation from the original term; which was a compound from Coi-El, or Co-El, the Cœlus of the Romans.
Concerning the term Cœl in Ennius, [417]Janus Gulielmus takes notice, that this poet copied the Dorians in using abbreviations, and writing Cœl for Cœlus and Cœlum. But herein this learned person is mistaken. The Dorians were not so much to be blamed for their abbreviating, as the other Greeks were for their unnecessary terminations, and inflexions. The more simple the terms, the more antient and genuine we may for the most part esteem them: and in the language of the Dorians we may perceive more terms relative to the true mythology of the country, and those rendered more similar to the antient mode of expression, than are elsewhere to be found. We must, therefore, in all etymological inquiries, have recourse to the Doric manner of pronunciation, to obtain the truth. They came into Greece, or Hellotia, under the name of Adorians; and from their simplicity of manners, and from the little intercourse maintained with foreigners, they preserved much of their antient tongue. For this there may be another additional reason obtained from Herodotus; who tells us, that they were more immediately descended from the people of the
[418]east. The antient hymns, sung in the Prutaneia all over Greece, were [419]Doric: so sacred was their dialect esteemed. Hence they cannot but afford great help in inquiries of this nature. What was by others styled Αθηνη, they expressed Αθανα: Cheops they rendered Chaops: Zeen, Zan:
Χαζηνη, Χαζανα: Μην, Μαν: Menes, Manes: Orchenoi, Orchanoi: Neith, Naith: Ιηνισος,
Ιανισος: Hephæstus, Hephastus: Caiete, Caiate: Demeter, Damater: all which will be found of great consequence in respect to etymology. And if they did not always admit of the terminations used by their neighbours: they by these means preserved many words in their primitive state: at least they were nearer to the originals. They seem to have retained the very term, of which I have been treating. It was by them styled Χαι, Cai; and signified a house, or cave: for the first houses in
the infancy of the world are supposed to have been caves or grottos[420]. They expressed it Cai, Caia, Caias, similar to the cava, cavus, and cavea of the Romans. When these places were of a great depth, or extent, they were looked upon with a kind of religious horror. A cavern of this sort was at Lacedæmon, with a building over it; of which in aftertimes they made use to confine malefactors. It was called Καιαδης, or as the Spartans expressed it, Καιαδας, the house of death.
[421]Καιαδας δεσμωτηριον—το παρα Λακεδαιμονιοις. Cai signified a cavern: Adas, which is subjoined, was the Deity, to whom it was sacred, esteemed the God of the infernal regions. He was by the Ionians, &c. expressed Ades, and Hades; and by other nations Ait, and Atis. Hence these caverns were also styled Καιετες, and Καιετοι. The author above quoted gives us the
terms variously exhibited: [422]Καιετοι.—Ὁι απο των σεισμων ῥωχμοι Καιετοι λεγονται. Και Καιαδας το δεσμωτηριον εντευθεν, το παρα Λακεδαιμονιοις, σπηλαιον. Hesychius renders it in the plural, and as a neuter: καιατα, ορυγματα. Whether it be compounded Cai-Ait, Cai-Atis, or Cai-Ades, the purport is the same. The den of Cacus was properly a sacred cave,
where Chus was worshipped, and the rites of fire were [423]practised. Cacus is the same name as Cuscha in Ethiopia, only reversed. The history of it was obsolete in the days of Virgil; yet some traces of it still remained.
Strabo says that many people called these caves Κωοι. [424]Ενιοι κωους μαλλον τα τοιαυτα
κοιλωματα λεγεσθαι φασιν. Hence he very truly explains a passage in Homer. The poet,



speaking of Theseus, Dryas, Polyphemus, and other heroes of the Mythic age, mentions their encountering with the mountaineers of Thessaly, whom he styles φηρες ορεσχωοι:
[425]
Καρτιστοι δη κεινοι επιχθονιων τραφεν ανδρων, Καρτιστοι μεν εσαν, και καρτιστοις εμαχοντο Φηρσιν ορεσχωοισι—
Ορεσχωος signified a person, who lived in a mountain habitation; whose retreat was a house in a mountain. Co, and Coa, was the name of such house. Strabo says that this term is alluded to by
Homer, when he styles Lacedæmon
[426]
Λακεδαιμονα κητωεσσαν, for it was by many thought to have been so called on account of their caverns. From hence we may fairly conclude, that
κητωεσσα was a mistake, or at least a variation, for
[427]
καιεταεσσα, from Cai-Atis; and that
Co,
[428]
Coa, Caia, were of the same purport.
But this term does not relate merely to a cavern; but to temples founded near such places: oftentimes the cave itself was a temple. Caieta, in Italy, near Cuma, called by Diodorus Καιητη, was so denominated on this account. It was a cave in the rock, abounding with variety of subterranes, cut out into various apartments. These were, of old, inhabited by Amonian priests; for
they settled in these parts very early. It seems to have been a wonderful work.
[429]
Ανεωγετ' εντευθεν σπηλαια ὑπερμεγεθη, κατοικιας μεγαλας, και πολυτελεις δεδεγμενα. In these parts were large openings in the earth, exhibiting caverns of a great extent; which afforded very ample and superb apartments. Diodorus informs us, that, what was in his time called Caiete,
had been sometimes styled
[430]
Aiete: by which we may see, that it was a compound; and consisted of two or more terms; but these terms were not precisely applicable to the same object. Ai-Ete, or Ai-Ata, was the region of Ait, the Deity to whom it was sacred. Colchis had the same name; whence its king was called Aietes: and Egypt had the same, expressed by the Greeks [431]
Αετια, Aetia. Aiete was the district: Caiete was the cave and temple in that district; where the Deity was worshipped.
In Bœotia was a cavern, into which the river Cephisus descended, and was lost. It afterwards emerged from this gulf, and passed freely to the sea. The place of eruption was called An-choa,
which signifies Fontis apertura. The later Greeks expressed it Anchoe
[432]
. Καλειται δ' ὁ τοπος Αγκοη· εστι δε λιμην ὁμωνυμος. The etymology, I flatter myself, is plain, and authenticated by the history of the place.
From Cho, and Choa, was probably derived the word Χοϊκος, used by the apostle.
[433]
Ὁ πρωτος ανθρωπος εκ γης Χοϊκος· ὁ δευτερος ανθρωπος ὁ Κυριος εξ ουρανου. Ὁιος ὁ Χοϊκος, και τοιαυτοι ὁι Χοϊκοι. Hesychius observes, Χοϊκος, πηλινος, γηινος. From hence we may perceive, that by Cho was originally meant a house or temple in the earth. It was, as I have shewn, often expressed Gau, and Go; and made to signify any house. Some nations used it in a still more extended sense; and by it denoted a town or village, and any habitation at large. It is found in this acceptation among the antient Celtæ, and Germans, as we learn from Cluverius. [434]
Apud ipsos Germanos ejusmodi pagorum vernaculum vocabulum fuit Gaw; et variantibus dialectis, găw, gew, gỏw, gow, hinc—Brisgaw, Wormesgaw, Zurichgow, Turgow, Nordgaw, Andegaw, Rhingaw, Hennegow, Westergow, Oostergow. The antient term Πυργος, Purgos, was properly Pur-Go; and signified a light-house, or temple of fire, from the Chaldaic Pur.
PARTICLES.
Together with the words above mentioned are to be found in composition the particles Al and Pi. Al, or El, for it is differently expressed in our characters, is still an Arabian prefix; but not absolutely confined to that country, though more frequently there to be found. The Sun, אור , was called Uchor by the people of Egypt and Cyrene, which the Greeks expressed Αχωρ, Achor. He
was worshipped with the same title in Arabia, and called Al Achor.
[435]
Georgius Monachus, describing the idolatry which prevailed in that country before the introduction of the present religion, mentions the idol Alachar. Many nations have both expletives and demonstratives analogous to the particle above. The pronoun Ille of the Romans is somewhat similar; as are the terms Le and La of the French; as well as Il and El in other languages. It is in composition so like to Ηλ, the name of Ἡλιος, the Sun, that it is not always easy to distinguish one from the other.



The article Pi was in use among the antient Egyptians and Cuthites, as well as other nations in the east. The natives of India were at all times worshippers of the Sun; and used to call themselves by some of his titles. Porus, with whom Alexander engaged upon the Indus, was named from the chief object of his worship, אור , Pi-Or, and P'Or; rendered by the Greeks Πωρος, Porus. Pacorus the Parthian was of the same etymology, being a compound of P'Achorus, the Achor of Egypt: as
was also the
[436]
city Pacoria in Mesopotamia, mentioned by Ptolemy. Even the Grecian πυρ was of Egyptian or Chaldaïc original, and of the same composition (P'Ur) as the words above; for [437]
Plato informs us that πυρ, ὑδωρ, κυνες, were esteemed terms of foreign importation. After the race of the Egyptian kings was extinct, and that country came under the dominion of the
Grecians, the natives still continued to make use of this prefix; as did other
[438]
nations which were incorporated with them. They adapted it not only to words in their own language, but to those of other countries of which they treated. Hence there is often to be found in their writings, [439]
Πιζευς, Πιμαρτυρ, Πιμαθητης, πισωμα, πιλαος, Pidux, Picurator, Pitribunus; also names of persons occur with this prefix; such as Piterus, Piturio, Pionius the martyr; also Pior,
Piammon, Piambo; who are all mentioned by ecclesiastical
[440]
writers as natives of that country. This article is sometimes expressed Pa; as in the name of Pachomius, an abbot in Egypt,
mentioned by
[441]
Gennadius. A priest named Paapis is to be found in the Excerpta from Antonius [442]
Diogenes in Photius. There were particular rites, styled Pamylia Sacra, from
[443]
Pamyles, an antient Egyptian Deity. We may infer from Hesychius that they were very obscene: Πααμυλης,
Αιγυπτιος Θεος Πριαπωδης. Hades, and Pi-Ades, was a common title of the Sun: and the latter, in early times, was current in Greece; where I hope to give ample testimony of the Amonians settling. He was termed Melech Pi-Adon, and Anac Pi-Adon: but the Greeks out of PiAdon formed Παιδων: for it is inconceivable how very ignorant they were in respect to their antient theology. Hence we read of παιδων Λητους, παιδων Ζηνος, παιδων Απολλωνος; and legends of παιδων αθανατων; and of παιδων; who were mere foundlings; whose fathers could never be ascertained, though divine honours were paid to the children. This often puzzled the mythologists, who could not account for this spurious race. Plutarch makes it one of his
inquiries to sift out,
[444]
Τις ὁ Παιδων ταφος παρα Χαλκιδευσι; Pausanias mentions,
[445]
Αμφιλυκου παιδων βωμος: and, in another place,
[446]
Βωμοι δε Θεον τε ονομαζομενων αγνωστων, και Ἡρωων, και ΠΑΙΔΩΝ του Θησεος, και Φαληρου. From this mistake arose so many boy-deities; among whom were even Jupiter and Dionusus: [447]
Αυτον τον Δια, και τον Διονυσον Παιδας, και νεους, ἡ θεολογια καλει. According to the theology of the Greeks, even Jupiter and Dionusus are styled boys, and young persons. One of the most remarkable passages to this purpose is to be found in the antiquary above quoted; who takes notice of a certain mysterious rite performed by the natives of Amphissa, in Phocis. The
particular Gods, to whom it was performed, were styled Ανακτες παιδες.
[448]
Αγουσι δε και τελετην ὁι Αμφισσεις των Ανακτων καλουμενων Παιδων. Ὁιτινες δε Θεων εισιν ὁι Ανακτες Παιδες, ου κατα τ' αυτα εστιν ειρημενον. The people of Amphissa perform a ceremony in honour of persons styled Anactes Paides, or Royal Boys: but who these Anactes Paides were, is matter of great uncertainty. In short, the author could not tell; nor could the priests afford him any satisfactory information. There are many instances in Pausanias of this nature; where divine honours are paid to the unknown children of fathers equally unknown.
Herodotus tells us, that, when he discoursed with the priests of Thebes about the kings who had reigned in Egypt, they described them to him under three denominations, of Gods, of heroes, and of men. The last succeeded to those above, and were mere mortals. The manner of succession is
mentioned in the following words:
[449]
Πιρωμιν εκ Πιρωμιος γεγονεναι—και ουτε ες θεον, ουτε ες Ἡρωα αναδησαν αυτους (ὁι Αιγυπτιοι). There are many strange and
contradictory opinions about this
[450]
passage; which, if I do not deceive myself, is very plain; and the purport of it this: After the fabulous accounts, there had been an uninterrupted succession of Piromis after Piromis: and the Egyptians referred none of these to the dynasties of either the Gods or Heroes, who were supposed to have first possessed the country. From hence I think it is manifest that Pi-romis signifies a man. Herodotus, indeed, says, that the meaning of it was καλος
καγαθος, a person of a fair and honourable character: and so it might be taken by implication;
as we say of a native of our own country, that he is a true and staunch
[451]
Englishman: but the precise meaning is plain from the context; and Piromis certainly meant a man. It has this
signification in the Coptic: and, in the
[452]
Prodromus Copticus of Kircher, Πιρωμι, Piromi, is a



man; and seems to imply a native. Pirem Racot is an Alexandrine; or, more properly, a native of
Racotis, called Raschid, and Rosetta. Pirem Romi are
[453]
Romans.
By means of this prefix we may be led to understand what is meant by Paraia in the account given by Philo from Sanchoniathon: who says, that Cronus had three sons in the region of Paraia: [454]
Εγεννηθησαν δε και εν Παραιᾳ Κρονῳ τρεις παιδες. Paraia is a variation of P'Ur-aia; and means literally the land of Ur in Chaldea; the region from whence antient writers began the
history of mankind. A crocodile by the Egyptians was among other names called
[455]
Σουχος:
and the name is retained in the Coptic, where it is expressed
[456]
Pi-Souchi.
This prefix is sometimes expressed with an aspirate, Phi: and as that word signifies a mouth, and in a more extensive signification, speech and language, it sometimes may cause a little uncertainty about the meaning. However, in most places it is sufficiently plain. Phaethon, a much mistaken personage, was an antient title of the Sun, a compound of Phi-Ath-On. Bacchus was called Phi
Anac by the Mysians, rendered by the poets
[457]
Phanac and Phanaces. Hanes was a title of the same Deity, equally reverenced of old, and compounded Ph' Hanes. It signified the fountain of light: and from it was derived Phanes of Egypt: also φαινω, φανεις, φανερος: and from Ph'ain On, Fanum. In short, these particles occur continually in words, which relate to religious rites, and the antient adoration of fire. They are generally joined to Ur, by which that element is denoted. From P'Ur Tor came Prætor and Prætorium, among the Romans: from P'Ur-Aith, Purathi and Puratheia among the Asiatics. From P'Ur-tan, πρυτανεις, and πρυτανεια among the Greeks of Hellas: in which Prutaneia there were of old sacred hearths, and a perpetual fire. The antient name of Latian Jupiter was P'ur, by length of time changed to Puer. He was the Deity of fire; and his ministers were styled Pueri: and because many of them were handsome youths selected for that office, Puer came at length to signify any young person. Some of the Romans would explain this title away, as if it referred to Jupiter's childhood: but the history of the place will shew that it had no such relation. It was a proper name, and retained particularly among the people of Præneste. They had undoubtedly been addicted to the rites of fire; for their city was said to have been built by Cæculus, the son of Vulcan, who was found in the midst of fire:
[458]
Vulcano genitum pecora inter agrestia Regem, Inventumque focis.
They called their chief God Pur: and dealt particularly in divination by lots, termed of old Purim. Cicero takes notice of this custom of divination at Præneste; and describes the manner, as well as the place: but gives into the common mistake, that the Purim related to Jupiter's childhood. He
says, that the place, where the process was carried on, was a sacred inclosure,
[459]
is est hodie locus septus, religiose propter Jovis Pueri, qui lactens cum Junone in gremio Fortunæ mammam appetens, castissime colitur a Matribus. This manner of divination was of Chaldaïc original, and brought from Babylonia to Præneste. It is mentioned in Esther, c. 3. v. 7. They cast Pur before Haman, that he might know the success of his purposes against the Jews. Wherefore they call
these days Purim after the name of Pur
[460]
. c. 9. v. 26. The same lots of divination being used at Præneste was the occasion of the God being called Jupiter Pur. This in aftertimes was changed to Puer: whence we find inscriptions, which mention him under that name; and at the same time take notice of the custom, which prevailed in his temple. Inscriptions Jovi Puero, and Fortunæ
Primigeniæ Jovis
[461]
Pueri are to be found in Gruter. One is very particular.
[462]
Fortunæ Primigeniæ Jovis Pueri D.D. Ex SORTE compos factus Nothus Ruficanæ L. P. Plotilla.
That this word Puer was originally Pur may be proved from a well known passage in Lucretius:
[463]
Puri sæpe lacum propter ac dolia curva Somno devincti credunt se attollere vestem.
Many instances, were it necessary, might be brought to this purpose. It was a name originally given to the priests of the Deity who were named from the Chaldaic אור , Ur: and by the antient Latines were called P'uri. At Præneste the name was particularly kept up on account of this
divination by
[464]
lots. These by the Amonians were styled Purim, being attended with ceremonies



by fire; and supposed to be effected through the influence of the Deity. Præneste seems to be a compound of Puren Esta, the lots of Esta, the Deity of fire.
These are terms, which seem continually to occur in the antient Amonian history: out of these most names are compounded; and into these they are easily resolvable. There are some few more, which might perhaps be very properly introduced: but I am unwilling to trespass too far, especially as they may be easily taken notice of in the course of this work. I could wish that my learned readers would afford me so far credit, as to defer passing a general sentence, till they have perused the whole: for much light will accrue; and fresh evidence be accumulated in the course of our procedure. A history of the rites and religion, in which these terms are contained, will be given; also of the times, when they were introduced; and of the people, by whom they were diffused so widely. Many positions, which may appear doubtful, when they are first premised, will, I hope, be abundantly proved, before we come to the close. In respect to the etymologies, which I have already offered and considered, I have all along annexed the histories of the persons and places spoken of, in order to ascertain my opinion concerning them. But the chief proof, as I have before said, will result from the whole; from an uniform series of evidence, supported by a fair and uninterrupted analogy.
OF
ETYMOLOGY,
AS IT HAS BEEN TOO GENERALLY HANDLED.
Αλλα θεοι των μεν μανιην απετρεψατε γλωσσης, Εκ δ' ὁσιων στοματων καθαρην οχετευσατε πηγην. Και σε, πολυμνηστη, λευκωλενε παρθενε, μουσα, Αντομαι, ὡν θεμις εστιν εφημεριοισιν ακουειν. Πεμπε παρ' ευσεβιης ελαουσ' ευηνιον ἁρμα.——E .
It may appear invidious to call to account men of learning, who have gone before me in inquiries of this nature, and to point out defects in their writings: but it is a task which I must, in some degree, take in hand, as the best writers have, in my opinion, failed fundamentally in these researches. Many, in the wantonness of their fancy, have yielded to the most idle surmises; and this to a degree of licentiousness, for which no learning nor ingenuity can atone. It is therefore so far from being injurious, that it appears absolutely necessary to point out the path they took, and the nature of their failure; and this, that their authority may not give a sanction to their mistakes; but, on the contrary, if my method should appear more plausible, or more certain, that the superiority may be seen upon comparing; and be proved from the contrast.
The Grecians were so prepossessed with a notion of their own excellence and antiquity, that they supposed every antient tradition to have proceeded from themselves. Hence their mythology is founded upon the grossest mistakes: as all extraneous history, and every foreign term, is supposed by them to have been of Grecian original. Many of their learned writers had been abroad; and knew how idle the pretensions of their countrymen were. Plato in particular saw the fallacy of their claim, he confesses it more than once: yet in this article nobody was more infatuated. His
Cratylus is made up of a most absurd system of etymology. [465]Herodotus expressly says, that the Gods of Greece came in great measure from Egypt. Yet Socrates is by Plato in this treatise made to derive Artemis from το αρτεμες, integritas: Poseidon from ποσι δεσμον, fetters to the feet:
Hestia from ουσια, substance and essence: Demeter, from διδουσα ὡς μητηρ, distributing as a
mother: Pallas from παλλειν, to vibrate, or dance: Ares, Mars, from αῤῥεν, masculum, et virile:
and the word Theos, God, undoubtedly the Theuth of Egypt, from θεειν, to run[466]. Innumerable
derivations of this nature are to be found in Aristotle, Plato, [467]Heraclides Ponticus, and other Greek writers. There is a maxim laid down by the scholiast upon Dionysius; which I shall have occasion often to mention. [468]Ει βαρβαρον το ονομα, ου χρη ζητειν Ἑλληνικην ετυμολογιαν αυτου. If the term be foreign, it is idle to have recourse to Greece for a solution. It is a plain and golden rule, posterior in time to the writers above, which, however, common sense might have led them to have anticipated, and followed: but it was not in their nature. The



person who gave the advice was a Greek, and could not for his life abide by it. It is true, that
Socrates is made to say something very like the above.
[469]
Εννοω γαρ, ὁτι πολλα ὁι Ἑλληνες ονοματα, αλλως τε και ὁι ὑπο τοις Βαρβαροις οικουντες, παρα των Βαρβαρων ειληφασι—ει τις ζητοι ταυτα κατα την Ἑλληνικην φωνην, ὡς εοικοτως κειται, αλλα μη κατ' εκεινην, εξ ἡς το ονομα τυγχανει ον, οισθα ὁτι αποροι αν. I am very sensible that the Grecians in general, and especially those who are subjects to foreigners, have received into their language many exotic terms: if any person should be led to seek for their analogy or meaning in the Greek tongue, and not in the language from whence they proceeded, he would be grievously puzzled. Who would think, when Plato attributed to Socrates this knowledge,
that he would make him continually act in contradiction to it? Or that other
[470]
writers, when this plain truth was acknowledged, should deviate so shamefully? that we should in after times be told, that Tarsus, the antient city in Cilicia, was denominated from ταρτος, a foot: that the river Nile
signified νε ιλυς: and that Gader in Spain was Γης δειρα.
The antients, in all their etymologies, were guided solely by the ear: in this they have been implicitly copied by the moderns. Inquire of Heinsius, whence Thebes, that antient city in upper
Egypt, was named; and he will tell you from תבא , Teba,
[471]
stetit: or ask the good bishop Cumberland why Nineve was so called? and he will answer, from Schindler, that it was a
compound of
[472]
Nin-Nau, נין נוה , a son inhabited. But is it credible, or indeed possible, for these cities to have been named from terms so vague, casual, and indeterminate; which seem to have so little relation to the places to which they are appropriated, or to any places at all? The history of the Chaldeans is of great consequence; and one would be glad to know their original. They are properly called Chasdim; and are, very justly, thought to have been the first constituted nation upon earth. It is said of the patriarch Abraham, that he came from the city Ur of the Chasdim.
Whence had they their name? The learned Hyde will
[473]
answer, that it was from Chesed, their ancestor. Who was Chesed? He was the fourth son of Nahor, who lived in Aram, the upper region of Mesopotamia. Is it said in history that he was the father of this people? There is no mention made of it. Is it said that he was ever in Chaldea? No. Is there the least reason to think that he had any acquaintance with that country? We have no grounds to suppose it. Is there any reason to think that this people, mentioned repeatedly as prior to him by ages, were in reality constituted after him? None. What, then, has induced writers to suppose that he was the father of this people? Because Chesed and Chasdim have a remote similitude in sound. And is this the whole? Absolutely all that is or can be alleged for this notion. And as the Chasdim are mentioned some ages before the birth of Chesed, some would have the passage to be introduced proleptically; others suppose it an interpolation, and would strike it out of the sacred text: so far does whim get the better of judgment, that even the written word is not safe. The whole history of Chesed is this: About fifty years after the patriarch Abraham had left his brother Nahor at Haran in Aramea, he
received intelligence that Nahor had in that interval been blessed with children.
[474]
It was told Abraham, behold Milcah, she also hath borne children to thy brother Nahor; Huz, Buz, Kemuel, and Chesed: of these Chesed was the fourth. There occurs not a word more concerning him.
It is moreover to be observed, that these etymologists differ greatly from one another in their conceptions; so that an unexperienced reader knows not whom to follow. Some deduce all from the Hebrew; others call in to their assistance the Arabic and the Coptic, or whatever tongue or dialect makes most for their purpose. The author of the Universal History, speaking of the
Moabitish Idol Chemosh, tells us,
[475]
that many make it come from the verb משש , mashash, to feel: but Dr. Hyde derives it from the Arabic, Khamûsh, which signifies gnats, (though in the particular dialect of the tribe Hodail) supposing it to have been an astronomical talisman in the figure of a gnat:—and Le Clerc, who takes this idol for the Sun, from Comosha, a root, in the same tongue, signifying to be swift. There is the same variety of sentiment about Silenus, the
companion of Bacchus.
[476]
Bochart derives his name from Silan, שילן , and supposes him to have been the same as Shiloh, the Messias. Sandford makes him to be Balaam, the false prophet. [477]
Huetius maintains that he was assuredly Moses. It is not uncommon to find even in the same writer great uncertainty: we have sometimes two, sometimes three, etymologies presented together of the same word: two out of the three must be groundless, and the third not a whit better: otherwise, the author would have given it the preference, and set the other two aside. An example
to this purpose we have in the etymology of Ramesses, as it is explained in the
[478]
Hebrew Onomasticum. Ramesses, tonitruum vel exprobratio tineæ; aut malum delens sive dissolvens; vel contractionem dissolvens, aut confractus a tineâ—civitas in extremis finibus Ægypti. A similar interpretation is given of Berodach, a king of Babylon. Berodach: creans contritionem, vel electio



interitus, aut filius interitus, vel vaporis tui; sive frumentum; vel puritas nubis, vel vaporis tui. Rex Babyloniæ.
It must be acknowledged of Bochart, that the system upon which he has proceeded is the most plausible of any; and he has shewn infinite ingenuity and learning. He every where tries to support his etymologies by some history of the place concerning which he treats. But the misfortune is, that the names of places which seem to be original, and of high antiquity, are too often deduced by him from circumstances of later date; from events in after ages. The histories to which he appeals were probably not known when the country, or island, received its name. He likewise allows himself a great latitude in forming his derivations: for, to make his terms accord, he has recourse, not only to the Phenician language, which he supposes to have been a dialect of the Hebrew; but to the Arabian, Chaldaic, and Syriac, according as his occasions require. It happens to him often to make use of a verb for a radix, which has many variations and different significations: but, at this rate, we may form a similitude between terms the most dissimilar. For, take a word in any language, which admits of many inflexions and variations, and, after we have made it undergo all its evolutions, it will be hard if it does not in some degree approximate. But, to say the truth, he many times does not seem to arrive even at this: for, after he has analysed the premises with great labour, we often find the supposed resemblance too vague and remote to be admitted; and the whole is effected with a great strain and force upon history before he brings matters to a seeming
coincidence. The Cyclops are by the best writers placed in Sicily, near Mount
[479]
Ætna, in the country of the Leontini, called of old Xuthia; but Bochart removes them to the south-west point of the island. This he supposes to have been called Lelub, Λιλυβαιον, from being opposite to Libya; and, as the promontory was so named, it is, he thinks, probable that the sea below was styled Chec Lelub, or Sinus Lebub: and, as the Cyclops lived hereabouts, they were from hence
denominated Chec-lelub, and Chec-lub, out of which the Greeks formed
[480]
Κυκλωπες. He
derives the Siculi first from
[481]
seclul, perfection; and afterwards from אשכול , Escol, pronounced,
according to the Syriac, Sigol, a bunch of grapes. He deduces the Sicani from שכן , Sacan
[482]
, near, because they were near their next neighbours; in other words, on account of their being next to the Pœni. Sicani, qui Siculorum Pœnis proximi. But, according to the best accounts, the Sicani were the most antient people of any in these parts. They settled in Sicily before the foundation of Carthage; and could not have been named from any such vicinity. In short, Bochart, in most of his derivations, refers to circumstances too general; which might be adapted to one place as well as to another. He looks upon the names of places, and of people, rather as by-names, and chance appellations, than original marks of distinction; and supposes them to have been founded upon some subsequent history. Whereas they were, most of them, original terms of high antiquity, imported and assumed by the people themselves, and not imposed by others.
How very casual and indeterminate the references were by which this learned man was induced to form his etymologies, let the reader judge from the samples below. These were taken, for the most part, from his accounts of the Grecian islands; not industriously picked out; but as they casually
presented themselves upon turning over the book. He derives
[483]
Delos from דהל , Dahal timor. [484]
Cynthus, from חנט , Chanat, in lucem edere.
[485]
Naxos, from nicsa, sacrificium; or else from
nicsa, opes.
[486]
Gyarus, from acbar, softened to acuar, a mouse; for the island was once infested
with mice.
[487]
Pontus, in Asia Minor, from בטנא , botno, a pistachio nut.
[488]
Icaria, from icar, pastures: but he adds, tamen alia etymologia occurrit, quam huic præfero אי כורי , Icaure, sive
insula piscium.
[489]
Chalcis, in Eubea, from Chelca, divisio.
[490]
Seriphus, from resiph, and

[491]
Patmos, from בטמוס , batmos, terebinthus; for trees of this sort, he says, grew in the Cyclades. But Patmos was not one of the Cyclades: it was an Asiatic island, at a
considerable distance.
[492]
Tenedos is deduced from Tin Edom, red earth: for there were potters in
the island, and the earth was probably red.
[493]
Cythnus, from katnuth, parvitas; or else from גובנא , gubna, or guphno, cheese; because the next island was famous for that commodity: Ut ut enim Cythnius caseus proprie non dicatur, qui e Cythno non est, tamen receptâ καταχρησει Cythnius
dici potuit caseus a vicinâ Ceo. He supposes Egypt to have been denominated from
[494]
Mazor, an artificial fortress; and the reason he gives, is, because it was naturally secure. Whatever may have been the purport of the term, Mizraim was a very antient and original name, and could have no reference to these after-considerations. The author of the Onomasticum, therefore, differs from him, and has tried to mend the matter. He allows that the people, and country, were denominated from Mazor, but in a different acceptation: from Mazor, which signified, the double pressure of a
mother on each side
[495]
, pressionem matris geminam, i. e. ab utrâque parte. Upon which the
learned Michaelis observes
[496]
quo etymo vix aliud veri dissimilius fingi potest.



In the theology of the Greeks are many antient terms, which learned men have tried to analyse, and define. But they seem to have failed here too by proceeding upon those fallacious principles, of which I have above complained. In short, they seldom go deep enough in their inquiries; nor consider the true character of the personage, which they would decypher. It is said of the God Vulcan, that he was the same as Tubalcain, mentioned Genesis. c. 4. v. 22: and it is a notion
followed by many writers: and among others by Gale.
[497]
First as to the name (says this learned man) Vossius, de Idolat. l. 1. c. 36, shews us, that Vulcanus is the same as Tubalcainus, only by a wonted, and easy mutation of B into V, and casting away a syllable. And he afterwards affects to prove from Diodorus Siculus, that the art and office of Vulcan exactly corresponded to the
character of Tubalcain,
[498]
who was an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron. Upon the same principles Philo Biblius speaking of Chrusor, a person of great antiquity, who first built a ship, and navigated the seas; who also first taught husbandry, and hunting, supposes him to have
been Vulcan; because it is farther said of him,
[499]
that he first manufactured iron. From this partial resemblance to Vulcan or Hephastus, Bochart is induced to derive his name from כרש אור ,
Chores Ur, an artificer in
[500]
fire. These learned men do not consider, that though the name, to which they refer, be antient, and oriental, yet the character, and attributes, are comparatively modern, having been introduced from another quarter. Vulcan the blacksmith, who was the master of the Cyclops, and forged iron in Mount Ætna, was a character familiar to the Greeks, and Romans. But this Deity among the Egyptians, and Babylonians, had nothing similar to this description. They esteemed Vulcan as the chief of the Gods the same as the Sun: and his name is a sacred title, compounded of Baal-Cahen, Belus sanctus, vel Princeps; equivalent to Orus, or Osiris. If the name were of a different original, yet it would be idle to seek for an etymology founded on later conceptions, and deduced from properties not originally inherent in the
personage. According to
[501]
Hermapion he was looked upon as the source of all divinity, and in consequence of it the inscription upon the portal of the temple at Heliopolis was Ἡφαιστῳ τῳ
Θεων Πατρι. To Vulcan the Father of the Gods. In short, they who first appropriated the name of Vulcan to their Deity, had no notion of his being an artificer in brass or iron: or an artificer in any degree. Hence we must be cautious in forming ideas of the antient theology of nations from the current notions of the Greeks, and Romans; and more especially from the descriptions of their poets. Polytheism, originally vile, and unwarrantable, was rendered ten times more base by coming through their hands. To instance in one particular: among all the dæmon herd what one is there of a form, and character, so odious, and contemptible as Priapus? an obscure ill-formed Deity, who was ridiculed and dishonoured by his very votaries. His hideous figure was made use of only as a bugbear to frighten children; and to drive the birds from fruit trees; with whose filth he was generally besmeared. Yet this contemptible God, this scarecrow in a garden, was held in
high repute at Lampsacus, and esteemed the same as
[502]
Dionusus. He was likewise by the
Egyptians reverenced as the principal God; no other than the Chaldaic
[503]
Aur, the same as Orus and Apis: whose rites were particularly solemn. It was from hence that he had his name: for Priapus of Greece is only a compound of Peor-Apis among the Egyptians. He was sometimes styled Peor singly; also Baal Peor; the same with whose rites the Israelites are so often [504]
upbraided. His temples likewise are mentioned, which are styled Beth Peor. In short, this wretched divinity of the Romans was looked upon by others as the soul of the world: the first
principle, which brought all things into light, and being.
[505]
Πριηπος ὁ κοσμος, η ὁ
προεστως αυτου Λογος. The author of the Orphic hymns styles him
[506]
Πρωτογονονγενεσιν μακαρων, θνητων τ' ανθρωπων. The first born of the world, from whom all the immortals, and mortals were descended. This is a character, which will hereafter be found to agree well with Dionusus. Phurnutus supposes Priapus to have been the same as Pan, the shepherd God: who was equally degraded, and misrepresented on one hand, and as highly reverenced on
the other.
[507]
Ισως δ' αν ὁυτος και ὁ Πριηπος ειη, καθ' ὁν προεισιν εις φως τα παντα· των αρχαιων δ' εισι Δαιμονων. Probably Pan is no other than the God Priapus, by whose
means all things were brought into light. They are both Deities of high
[508]
antiquity. Yet the one was degraded to a filthy monster; and of the other they made a scarecrow.
DISSERTATION
UPON THE



HELLADIAN
AND OTHER
GRECIAN WRITERS.
Ενθα πυλαι νυκτος τε, και ηματος, εισι κελευθων.——P .
It may be proper to take some previous notice of those writers, to whose assistance we must particularly have recourse; and whose evidence may be most depended upon, in disquisitions of this nature. All knowledge of Gentile antiquity must be derived to us through the hands of the Grecians: and there is not of them a single writer, to whom we may not be indebted for some advantage. The Helladians, however, from whom we might expect most light, are to be admitted with the greatest caution. They were a bigotted people, highly prejudiced in their own favour; and so devoted to idle tradition, that no arguments could wean them from their folly. Hence the surest resources are from Greeks of other countries. Among the Poets, Lycophron, Callimachus, and Apollonius Rhodius are principally to be esteemed. The last of these was a native of Egypt; and the other two lived there, and have continual allusions to the antiquities of that country. Homer likewise abounds with a deal of mysterious lore, borrowed from the antient Amonian theology; with which his commentators have been often embarrassed. To these may be added such Greek writers of later date, who were either not born in Hellas, or were not so deeply tinctured with the vanity of that country. Much light may be also obtained from those learned men, by whom the Scholia were written, which are annexed to the works of the Poets above-mentioned. Nonnus too,
who wrote the Dionysiaca, is not to be neglected. He was a native of Panopolis in Egypt, [509]Εκ
της Πανος της Αιγυπτου γεγενημενος; and had opportunity of collecting many antient traditions, and fragments of mysterious history, which never were known in Greece. To these may be added Porphyry, Proclus, and Jamblichus, who professedly treat of Egyptian learning. The Isis and Osiris of Plutarch may be admitted with proper circumspection. It may be said, that the whole is still an enigma: and I must confess that it is: but we receive it more copiously exemplified; and more clearly defined; and it must necessarily be more genuine, by being nearer the fountain head: so that by comparing, and adjusting the various parts, we are more likely to arrive at a solution of the hidden purport. But the great resource of all is to be found among the later antiquaries and historians. Many of these are writers of high rank; particularly Diodorus, Strabo, and Pausanias, on the Gentile part: and of the fathers, Theophilus, Tatianus Athenagoras, Clemens, Origenes, Eusebius, Theodoretus, Syncellus; and the compiler of the Fasti Siculi, otherwise called Chronicon Paschale. Most of these were either of Egypt or Asia. They had a real taste for antiquity; and lived at a time when some insight could be obtained: for till the Roman Empire was fully established, and every province in a state of tranquillity, little light could be procured from those countries, whence the mythology of Greece was derived. The native Helladians were very limited in their knowledge. They had taken in the gross whatever was handed down by tradition; and assumed to themselves every history, which was imported. They moreover held every nation but their own as barbarous; so that their insuperable vanity rendered it impossible for them to make any great advances in historical knowledge. But the writers whom I just now mentioned, either had not these prejudices; or lived at a time when they were greatly subsided. They condescended to quote innumerable authors, and some of great antiquity; to whom the pride of Greece would never have appealed. I had once much talk upon this subject with a learned friend, since lost to the world, who could ill brook that Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, should be discarded for Clemens, Origen, or Eusebius; and that Lysias and Demosthenes should give way to Libanius and Aristides. The name of Tzetzes, or Eustathius, he could not bear. To all which I repeatedly made answer; that it was by no means my intention to set aside any of the writers, he mentioned: whose merits, as far as they extended, I held in great veneration. On the contrary, I should have recourse to their assistance, as far as it would carry me: But I must at the same time take upon me to weigh those merits; and see wherein they consisted; and to what degree they were to be trusted. The Helladians were much to be admired for the smoothness of their periods, and a happy collocation of their terms. They shewed a great propriety of diction; and a beautiful arrangement of their ideas: and the whole was attended with a rhythm, and harmony, no where else to be found. But they were at the same time under violent prejudices: and the subject matter of which they treated, was in general so brief, and limited, that very little could be obtained from it towards the history of other countries, or a knowledge of antient times. Even in respect to their own affairs, whatever light had been derived to them, was so perverted, and came through so dim a medium, that it is difficult to make use of it to any determinate and salutary purpose. Yet the



beauty of their composition has been attended with wonderful [510]influence. Many have been so far captivated by this magic, as to give an implicit credence to all that has been transmitted; and to sacrifice their judgment to the pleasures of the fancy.
It may be said, that the writers, to whom I chiefly appeal, are, in great measure, dry and artless, without any grace and ornament to recommend them. They were likewise posterior to the Helladians; consequently farther removed from the times of which they treat. To the first objection I answer, that the most dry and artless historians are, in general, the most authentic. They who colour and embellish, have the least regard for the truth. In respect to priority, it is a specious claim; but attended with no validity. When a gradual darkness has been overspreading the world, it requires as much time to emerge from the cloud, as there passed when we were sinking into it: so that they who come later may enjoy a greater portion of light, than those who preceded them by ages. Besides, it is to be considered, that the writers, to whom I chiefly appeal, lived in parts of the world which gave them great advantages. The whole theology of Greece was derived from the east. We cannot therefore but in reason suppose, that Clemens of Alexandria, Eusebius of Cæsarea, Tatianus of Assyria, Lucianus of Samosata, Cyril of Jerusalem, Porphyry of Syria, Proclus of Lycia, Philo of Biblus, Strabo of Amasa, Pausanias of Cappadocia, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, must know more upon this subject than any native Helladian. The like may be said of Diodorus, Josephus, Cedrenus, Syncellus, Zonaras, Eustathius: and numberless more. These had
the archives of antient [511]temples, to which they could apply: and had traditions more genuine than ever reached Greece. And though they were posterior themselves, they appeal to authors far prior to any Helladians: and their works are crowded with extracts from the most curious and the
most antient [512]histories. Such were the writings of Sanchoniathon, Berosus, Nicholaus Damascenus, Mocus, Mnaseas, Hieronymus Ægyptius, Apion, Manethon: from whom Abydenus, Apollodorus, Asclepiades, Artapanus, Philastrius, borrowed largely. We are beholden to
Clemens[513], and Eusebius, for many evidences from writers, long since lost; even Eustathius and Tzetzes have resources, which are now no more.
It must be after all confessed, that those, who preceded, had many opportunities of information, had they been willing to have been informed. It is said, both of Pythagoras and Solon, that they resided for some time in Egypt: where the former was instructed by a Son-chen, or priest of the Sun. But I could never hear of any great good that was the consequence of his travels. Thus much is certain; that whatever knowledge he may have picked up in other parts, he got nothing from the Grecians. They, who pretended most to wisdom, were the most destitute of the blessing. [514]Αλλα παρ αλλοις συλλεξαμενος, μονον παρα των σοφων Ἑλληνων εχειν ουδεν, πενιᾳ σοφιας και αποριᾳ συνοικουντων. And as their theology was before very obscure, he drew over it a mysterious veil to make it tenfold darker. The chief of the intelligence transmitted by Solon from Egypt contained a satire upon his own country. He was told by an antient
[515]priest, that the Grecians were children in science: that they were utterly ignorant of the mythology of other nations; and did not understand their own. Eudoxus likewise and Plato were in Egypt; and are said to have resided there some time: yet very few things of moment have been transmitted by them. Plato had great opportunities of rectifying the history and mythology of Greece: but after all his advantages he is accused of trifling shamefully, and addicting himself to fable. [516]Πλατων δε, ὁ δοκων των Ἑλληνων σοφωτατος γεγενησθαι, εις ποσην φλυαριαν εχωρησεν. Yet all the rites of the Helladians, as well as their Gods and Heroes, were
imported from the [517]east: and chiefly from [518]Egypt, though they were unwilling to allow it. Length of time had greatly impaired their true history; and their prejudices would not suffer them to retrieve it. I should therefore think it by no means improper to premise a short account of this wonderful people, in order to shew whence this obscurity arose; which at last prevailed so far, that they, in great measure, lost sight of their origin, and were involved in mystery and fable.
The first inhabitants of the country, called afterwards Hellas, were the sons of Javan; who seem to have degenerated very early, and to have become truly barbarous. Hence the best historians of Greece confess, that their ancestors were not the first inhabitants; but that it was before their
arrival in the possession of a people, whom they style [519]Βαρβαροι, or Barbarians. The Helladians were colonies of another family: and introduced themselves somewhat later. They were of the race which I term Amonian; and came from Egypt and Syria: but originally from Babylonia. They came under various titles, all taken from the religion, which they professed. Of these titles I shall have occasion to treat at large; and of the imaginary leaders, by whom they were supposed to have been conducted.



As soon as the Amonians were settled, and incorporated with the natives, a long interval of darkness ensued. The very union produced a new language: at least the antient Amonian became by degrees so modified, and changed, that the terms of science, and worship, were no longer understood. Hence the titles of their Gods were misapplied: and the whole of their theology grew more and more corrupted; so that very few traces of the original were to be discovered. In short,
almost every term was misconstrued, and abused. This[520] æra of darkness was of long duration: at last the Asiatic Greeks began to bestir themselves. They had a greater correspondence than the Helladians: and they were led to exert their talents from examples in Syria, Egypt, and other countries. The specimens, which they exhibited of their genius were amazing: and have been justly esteemed a standard for elegance and nature. The Athenians were greatly affected with these examples. They awoke, as it were, out of a long and deep sleep; and, as if they had been in the training of science for ages, their first efforts bordered upon perfection. In the space of a century, out of one little confined district, were produced a group of worthies, who at all times have been the wonder of the world: so that we may apply to the nation in general what was spoken of the school of a philosopher: cujus ex ludo, tanquam ex Equo Trojano, meri Principes exierunt. But this happy display of parts did not remedy the evil of which I have complained. They did not retrieve any lost annals, nor were any efforts made to dispel the cloud in which they were involved. There had been, as I have represented, a long interval; during which there must have happened great occurrences: but few of them had been transmitted to posterity; and those handed down by tradition, and mixed with inconsistency and fable. It is said that letters were
brought into Greece very early, by [521]Cadmus. Let us for a while grant it; and inquire what was the progress. They had the use of them so far as to put an inscription on the pediment of a temple, or upon a pillar; or to scrawl a man's name upon a tile or an oyster-shell, when they wanted to banish or poison him. Such scanty knowledge, and so base materials, go but a little way towards science. What history was there of Corinth, or of Sparta? What annals were there of Argos, or
Messena; of Elis, or the cities of Achaia? None: not even of [522]Athens. There are not the least grounds to surmise that any single record existed. The names of the Olympic victors from Corœbus, and of the priestesses of Argos, were the principal memorials to which they pretended: but how little knowledge could be obtained from hence! The laws of Draco, in the thirty-ninth Olympiad, were certainly the most antient writing to which we can securely appeal. When the Grecians began afterwards to bestir themselves, and to look back upon what had passed, they
collected whatever accounts could be [523]obtained. They tried also to separate and arrange them, to the best of their abilities, and to make the various parts of their history correspond. They had still some good materials to proceed upon, had they thoroughly understood them; but herein was a great failure. Among the various traditions handed down, they did not consider which really
related to their country, and which had been introduced from other[524] parts. Indeed they did not chuse to distinguish, but adopted all for their own; taking the merit of every antient transaction to themselves. No people had a greater love for science, nor displayed a more refined taste in composition. Their study was ever to please, and to raise admiration. Hence they always aimed at the marvellous, which they dressed up in a most winning manner: at the same time they betrayed a seeming veneration for antiquity. But their judgment was perverted, and this veneration attended
with little regard for the truth. [525]They had a high opinion of themselves, and of their country in general: and, being persuaded that they sprang from the ground on which they stood, and that the Arcadians were older than the moon, they rested satisfied with this, and looked no farther. In short, they had no love for any thing genuine, no desire to be instructed. Their history could not be reformed but by an acknowledgment which their pride would not suffer them to make. They therefore devoted themselves to an idle mythology: and there was nothing so contradictory and absurd but was greedily admitted, if sanctified by tradition. Even when the truth glared in their very faces, they turned from the light, and would not be undeceived. Those who, like Euemerus and Ephorus, had the courage to dissent from their legends, were deemed atheists and apostates, and treated accordingly. Plutarch more than once insists that it is expedient to veil the truth, and to
dress it up in [526]allegory. They went so far as to deem inquiry a [527]crime, and thus precluded the only means by which the truth could be obtained.
Nor did these prejudices appear only in respect to their own rites and theology, and the history of their own nation: the accounts which they gave of other countries were always tinctured with this predominant vanity. An idle zeal made them attribute to their forefathers the merit of many great performances to which they were utterly strangers: and supposed them to have founded cities in various parts of the world where the name of Greece could not have been known; cities which were in being before Greece was a state. Wherever they got footing, or even a transient acquaintance, they in their descriptions accommodated every thing to their own preconceptions; and expressed all terms according to their own mode of writing and pronunciation, that



appearances might be in their favour. To this were added a thousand silly stories to support their pretended claim. They would persuade us that Jason of Greece founded the empire of the Medes; as Perseus, of the same country, did that of the Persians. Armenus, a companion of Jason, was the reputed father of the Armenians. They gave out that Tarsus, one of the most antient cities in the
world, was built by people from [528]Argos; and that Pelusium of Egypt had a name of Grecian
[529]original. They, too, built Sais, in the same [530]country: and the city of the Sun, styled
Heliopolis, owed its origin to an [531]Athenian. They were so weak as to think that the city Canobus had its name from a pilot of Menelaus, and that even Memphis was built by Epaphos of
[532]Argos. There surely was never any nation so incurious and indifferent about truth. Hence
have arisen those contradictions and inconsistences with which their history is [533]embarrassed.
It may appear ungracious, and I am sure it is far from a pleasing task to point out blemishes in a people of so refined a turn as the Grecians, whose ingenuity and elegance have been admired for ages. Nor would I engage in a display of this kind, were it not necessary to shew their prejudices and mistakes, in order to remedy their failures. On our part we have been too much accustomed to take in the gross with little or no examination, whatever they have been pleased to transmit: and there is no method of discovering the truth but by shewing wherein they failed, and pointing out the mode of error, the line of deviation. By unravelling the clue, we may be at last led to see things in their original state, and to reduce their mythology to order. That my censures are not groundless, nor carried to an undue degree of severity, may be proved from the like accusations
from some of their best writers; who accuse them both of ignorance and forgery. [534]Hecatæus, of Miletus, acknowledges, that the traditions of the Greeks were as ridiculous as they were
numerous: [535]and Philo confesses that he could obtain little intelligence from that quarter: that the Grecians had brought a mist upon learning, so that it was impossible to discover the truth: he therefore applied to people of other countries for information, from whom only it could be
obtained. Plato[536] owned that the most genuine helps to philosophy were borrowed from those
who by the Greeks were styled barbarous: and [537]Jamblichus gives the true reason for the preference. The Helladians, says this writer, are ever wavering and unsettled in their principles, and are carried about by the least impulse. They want steadiness; and if they obtain any salutary knowledge, they cannot retain it; nay, they quit it with a kind of eagerness; and, whatever they do admit, they new mould and fashion, according to some novel and uncertain mode of reasoning. But people of other countries are more determinate in their principles, and abide more uniformly by the very terms which they have traditionally received. They are represented in the same light by
Theophilus: [538]he says, that they wrote merely for empty praise, and were so blinded with vanity, that they neither discovered the truth theirselves, nor encouraged others to pursue it. Hence
Tatianus says, with great truth, [539]that the writers of other countries were strangers to that vanity with which the Grecians were infected: that they were more simple and uniform, and did not encourage themselves in an affected variety of notions.
In respect to foreign history, and geographical knowledge, the Greeks, in general, were very ignorant: and the writers, who, in the time of the Roman Empire, began to make more accurate inquiries, met with insuperable difficulties from the mistakes of those who had preceded. I know no censure more severe and just than that which Strabo has passed upon the historians and geographers of Greece, and of its writers in general. In speaking of the Asiatic nations, he assures us, that there never had been any account transmitted of them upon which we can depend.
[540]Some of these nations, says this judicious writer, the Grecians have called Sacæ, and others Massagetæ, without having the least light to determine them. And though they have pretended to give a history of Cyrus, and his particular wars with those who were called Massagetæ, yet nothing precise and satisfactory could ever be obtained; not even in respect to the war. There is the same uncertainty in respect to the antient history of the Persians, as well as to that of the Medes and Syrians. We can meet with little that can be deemed authentic, on account of the weakness of those who wrote, and their uniform love of fable. For, finding that writers, who professedly dealt in fiction without any pretensions to the truth, were regarded, they thought that they should make their writings equally acceptable, if in the system of their history they were to introduce circumstances, which they had neither seen nor heard, nor received upon the authority of another person; proceeding merely upon this principle, that they should be most likely to please people's fancy by having recourse to what was marvellous and new. On this account we may more safely trust to Hesiod and Homer, when they present us with a list of Demigods and Heroes, and even to the tragic poets, than to Ctesias, Herodotus, and Hellanicus, and writers of that class. Even the generality of historians, who wrote about Alexander, are not safely to be trusted: for they speak with great confidence, relying upon the glory of the monarch, whom they celebrate; and to



the remoteness of the countries, in which he was engaged; even at the extremities of Asia; at a great distance from us and our concerns. This renders them very secure. For what is referred to a distance is difficult to be confuted. In another place, speaking of India, he says, that it was very
difficult to arrive at the truth: for the [541]writers, who must necessarily be appealed to, were in continual opposition, and contradicted one another. And how, says Strabo, could it be otherwise? for if they erred so shamefully when they had ocular proof, how could they speak with certainty,
where they were led by hearsay? In another place[542] he excuses the mistakes of the antient poets, saying, that we must not wonder if they sometimes deviated from the truth, when people in ages more enlightened were so ignorant, and so devoted to every thing marvellous and incredible. He had above given the poets even the preference to other writers: but herein his zeal transported him too far. The first writers were the poets; and the mischief began from them. They first infected tradition; and mixed it with allegory and fable. Of this Athenagoras accuses them very justly; and
says, [543]that the greatest abuses of true knowledge came from them. I insist, says this learned father, that we owe to Orpheus, Homer, and Hesiod, the fictitious names and genealogies of the Pagan Dæmons, whom they are pleased to style Gods: and I can produce Herodotus for a witness to what I assert. He informs us, that Homer and Hesiod were about four hundred years prior to himself; and not more. These, says he, were the persons who first framed the theogony of the Greeks; and gave appellations to their Deities; and distinguished them according to their several ranks and departments. They at the same time described them under different appearances: for till their time there was not in Greece any representation of the Gods, either in sculpture or painting; not any specimen of the statuary's art exhibited: no such substitutes were in those times thought of.
The antient history and mythology of Greece was partly transmitted by the common traditions of the natives: and partly preserved in those original Doric hymns, which were universally sung in their Prutaneia and temples. These were in the antient Amonian language; and said to have been
introduced by [544]Pagasus, Agyieus, and Olen. This last some represent as a Lycian, others as an Hyperborean: and by many he was esteemed an Egyptian. They were chanted by the Purcones, or priests of the Sun: and by the female, Hierophants: of whom the chief upon record were
[545]Phaënnis, [546]Phæmonoë, and Bæo. The last of these mentions Olen, as the inventor of verse, and the most antient priest of Phœbus.
[547]Ωλην δ' ὁς γενετο πρωτος Φοιβοιο προφητες, Πρωτος δ' αρχαιων επεων τεχνωσατ' αοιδαν.
These hymns grew, by length of time, obsolete; and scarce intelligible. They were, however, translated, or rather imitated, by Pamphos, Rhianus, Phemius, Homer, Bion Proconnesius, Onomacritus, and others. Many of the sacred terms could not be understood, nor interpreted; they
were however [548]retained with great reverence: and many which they did attempt to decipher, were misconstrued and misapplied. Upon this basis was the theology of Greece founded: from hence were the names of Gods taken: and various departments attributed to the several Deities. Every poet had something different in his theogony: and every variety, however inconsistent, was
admitted by the Greeks without the least hesitation: [549]Φυσει γαρ Ἑλληνες νεοτροποι
Ἑλλησιν αταλαιπωρος της αληθειας ζητησις. The Grecians, says Jamblichus, are naturally led by novelty: The investigation of truth is too fatiguing for a Grecian. From these antient hymns
and misconstrued terms [550]Pherecydes of Syrus planned his history of the Gods: which, there is reason to think, was the source of much error.
Such were the principles which gave birth to the mythology of the Grecians; from whence their antient history was in great measure derived. As their traditions were obsolete, and filled with extraneous matter, it rendered it impossible for them to arrange properly the principal events of their country. They did not separate and distinguish; but often took to themselves the merit of transactions, which were of a prior date, and of another clime. These they adopted, and made their own. Hence, when they came to digest their history, it was all confused: and they were embarrassed with numberless contradictions, and absurdities, which it was impossible to
[551]remedy. For their vanity, as I have shewn, would not suffer them to rectify their mistakes by the authority of more antient and more learned nations. It is well observed by Tatianus
[552]Assyrius, that where the history of times past has not been duly adjusted, it is impossible to arrive at the truth: and there has been no greater cause of error in writing, than the endeavouring to adopt what is groundless and inconsistent. Sir Isaac Newton somewhere lays it down for a rule, never to admit for history what is antecedent to letters. For traditionary truths cannot be long



preserved without some change in themselves, and some addition of foreign circumstances. This accretion will be in every age enlarged; till there will at last remain some few outlines only of the original occurrence. It has been maintained by many, that the Grecians had letters very early: but it will appear upon inquiry to have been a groundless notion. Those of the antients, who
considered the matter more carefully, have made no scruple to set aside their [553]pretensions.
Josephus in particular takes notice of their early claim; but cannot allow it: [554]They, says this learned historian, who would carry the introduction of letters among the Greeks the highest, very gravely tell us, that they were brought over by the Phenicians, and Cadmus. Yet, after all, they cannot produce a single specimen either from their sacred writings, or from their popular records, which savours of that antiquity. Theophilus takes notice of these difficulties; and shews that all the obscurity, with which the history of Hellas is clouded, arose from this deficiency of letters. He
complains, that the [555]Hellenes had lost sight of the truth; and could not recollect any genuine history. The reason of this is obvious: for they came late to the knowledge of letters in comparison of other nations. This they confess, by attributing the invention of them to people prior to themselves; either to the Chaldeans, or the Egyptians: or else to the Phenicians. Another cause of failure, which relates to their theology, and still greatly prevails, is owing to their not making a proper disquisition about the true object of worship: but amusing themselves with idle, and unprofitable speculations.
Notwithstanding this deficiency, they pretended to give a list of Argive princes, of which twenty
preceded the war of [556]Troy. But what is more extraordinary, they boasted of a series of twentysix Kings at Sicyon, comprehending a space of one thousand years, all which kings were before
the time of [557]Theseus and the Argonauts. Among those, who have given the list of the Argive
kings, is [558]Tatianus Assyrius, who advises every person of sense, when he meets with these high pretensions, to consider attentively, that there was not a single voucher, not even a tradition of any record, to authenticate these histories: for even Cadmus was many ages after. It is certain, that the Helladians had no tendency to learning, till they were awakened by the Asiatic Greeks: and it was even then some time before letters were in general use; or any histories, or even records attempted. For if letters had been current, and the materials for writing obvious, and in common use, how comes it that we have not one specimen older than the reign of Cyrus? And how is it possible, if the Grecians had any records, that they should be so ignorant about some of their most famous men? Of Homer how little is known! and of what is transmitted, how little, upon which we may depend! Seven places in Greece contend for his birth: while many doubt whether he was
of Grecian original. It is said of Pythagoras, [559]that according to Hippobotrus he was of Samos: but Aristoxenus, who wrote his life, as well as Aristarchus, and Theopompus, makes him a Tyrrhenian. According to Neanthes he was of Syria, or else a native of Tyre. In like manner Thales was said by Herodotus, Leander, and Duris, to have been a Phenician: but he was by others referred to Miletus in Ionia. It is reported of Pythagoras, that he visited Egypt in the time of Cambyses. From thence he betook himself to Croton in Italy: where he is supposed to have resided till the last year of the seventieth Olympiad: consequently he could not be above thirty or forty years prior to the birth of Æschylus and Pindar. What credit can we give to people for histories many ages backward; who were so ignorant in matters of importance, which happened in the days of their fathers? The like difficulties occur about Pherecydes Syrius; whom Suidas styles Babylonius: neither the time, when he lived, nor the place of his birth, have been ever satisfactorily proved. Till Eudoxus had been in Egypt the Grecians did not know the space of which the true year consisted. [560]Αλλ' ηγνοειτο τεως ὁ ενιαυτος παρα τοις Ἑλλησιν, ὡς και αλλα πλειω.
Another reason may be given for the obscurity in the Grecian history, even when letters had been introduced among them. They had a childish antipathy to every foreign language: and were equally prejudiced in favour of their own. This has passed unnoticed; yet was attended with the most fatal consequences. They were misled by the too great delicacy of their ear; and could not bear any term which appeared to them barbarous and uncouth. On this account they either rejected
foreign [561]appellations; or so modelled and changed them, that they became, in sound and meaning, essentially different. And as they were attached to their own country, and its customs, they presumed that every thing was to be looked for among themselves. They did not consider, that the titles of their Gods, the names of cities, and their terms of worship, were imported: that their ancient hymns were grown obsolete: and that time had wrought a great change. They explained every thing by the language in use, without the least retrospect or allowance: and all names and titles from other countries were liable to the same rule. If the name were dissonant, and disagreeable to their ear, it was rejected as barbarous: but if it were at all similar in sound to any word in their language, they changed it to that word; though the name were of Syriac original; or



introduced from Egypt, or Babylonia. The purport of the term was by these means changed: and the history, which depended upon it, either perverted or effaced. When the title Melech, which signified a King, was rendered Μειλιχος and Μειλιχιος, sweet and gentle, it referred to an idea quite different from the original. But this gave them no concern: they still blindly pursued their purpose. Some legend was immediately invented in consequence of this misprision, some story about bees and honey, and the mistake was rendered in some degree plausible. This is a circumstance of much consequence; and deserves our attention greatly. I shall have occasion to speak of it repeatedly; and to lay before the reader some entire treatises upon the subject. For this failure is of such a nature, as, when detected. and fairly explained, will lead us to the solution of many dark and enigmatical histories, with which the mythology of Greece abounds. The only author, who seems to have taken any notice of this unhappy turn in the Grecians, is Philo Biblius.
[562]He speaks of it as a circumstance of very bad consequence, and says, that it was the chief cause of error and obscurity: hence, when he met in Sanchoniathon with antient names, he did not indulge himself in whimsical solutions; but gave the true meaning, which was the result of some event or quality whence the name was imposed. This being a secret to the Greeks, they always took things in a wrong acceptation; being misled by a twofold sense of the terms which occurred to them: one was the genuine and original meaning, which was retained in the language whence they were taken: the other was a forced sense, which the Greeks unnaturally deduced from their own language, though there was no relation between them. The same term in different languages conveyed different and opposite ideas: and as they attended only to the meaning in their own
tongue, they were constantly [563]mistaken.
It may appear strange to make use of the mistakes of any people for a foundation to build upon: yet through these failures my system will be in some degree supported: at least from a detection of these errors, I hope to obtain much light. For, as the Grecian writers have preserved a kind of uniformity in their mistakes, and there appears plainly a rule and method of deviation, it will be very possible, when this method is well known, to decypher what is covertly alluded to; and by these means arrive at the truth. If the openings in the wood or labyrinth are only as chance allotted, we may be for ever bewildered: but if they are made with design, and some method be discernible, this circumstance, if attended to, will serve for a clue, and lead us through the maze. If we once know that what the Greeks, in their mythology, styled a wolf, was the Sun; that by a dog was meant a prince, or Deity; that by bees was signified an order of priests; these terms, however misapplied, can no more mislead us in writing, than their resemblances in sculpture would a native of Egypt, if they were used for emblems on stone.
Thus much I have been obliged to premise: as our knowledge must come through the hands of the
[564]Grecians. I am sensible, that many learned men have had recourse to other means for information: but I have never seen any specimens which have afforded much light. Those, to which I have been witness, have rather dazzled than illustrated; and bewildered instead of conducting to the truth. Among the Greeks is contained a great treasure of knowledge. It is a rich mine; which as yet has not been worked far beneath the surface. The ore lies deep, and cannot be obtained without much industry and labour. The Helladians had the best opportunities to have afforded us information about the antiquities of their country: of their negligence, and of their mistakes I have spoken; yet with a proper clue they may still be read to great advantage. To say the truth, there is scarce an author of them all, from whom some good may not be derived.
What has been wanting in the natives of Greece, has been greatly supplied by writers of that nation from other countries, who lived in after-times. Of these the principal have been mentioned; and many others might be added, who were men of integrity and learning. They were fond of knowledge, and obtained a deep insight into antiquity: and, what is of the greatest consequence, they were attached to the truth. They may sometimes have been mistaken in their judgment: they may also have been deceived: but still truth was the scope at which they aimed. They have accordingly transmitted to us many valuable remains, which, but for them, had been buried in oblivion. There are likewise many pagan authors, to whom we are greatly indebted; but especially to Strabo and Pausanias; who in their different departments have afforded wonderful light. Nor must we omit Josephus of Judea; whose treatise against Apion must be esteemed of inestimable value: indeed, all his writings are of consequence, if read with a proper allowance.
I have mentioned, that it is my purpose to give a history of the first ages; and to shew the origin of many nations, whose descent has been mistaken; or else totally unknown. I shall speak particularly of one great family, which diffused itself over many parts of the earth; from whom the rites and mysteries, and almost the whole science of the Gentile world, were borrowed. But as I venture in an unbeaten track, and in a waste, which has been little frequented; I shall first take upon me to treat of things near at hand, before I advance to remoter discoveries. I shall therefore



speak of those rites and customs, and of the nations, where they prevailed; as I shall by these means be led insensibly to the discovery of the people, from whom they were derived. By a similarity of customs, as well as by the same religious terms, observable in different countries, it will be easy to shew a relation, which subsisted between such people, however widely dispersed. They will be found to have been colonies of the same family; and to have come ultimately from the same place. As my course will be in great measure an uphill labour, I shall proceed in the manner which I have mentioned; continually enlarging my prospect, till I arrive at the point I aim at.
It may be proper to mention to the reader that the following treatises were not written in the order in which they now stand; but just as the subject-matter presented itself before me. As many, which were first composed, will occur last, I have been forced to anticipate some of the arguments, as well as quotations, which they contained, according as I found it expedient. Hence there will be some few instances of repetition, which however I hope will not give any great disgust: as what is repeated, was so interwoven in the argument, that I could not well disengage it from the text, where it occurs a second time.
There will also be found some instances, where I differ from myself, and go contrary to positions in a former treatise. These are very few, and of no great moment; being such as would probably escape the reader's notice. But I think it more ingenuous, and indeed my strict duty, to own my mistakes, and point them out, rather than to pass them over in silence, or idly to defend them.
SOME NECESSARY
RULES AND OBSERVATIONS
IN RESPECT TO
ETYMOLOGICAL INQUIRIES;
AND FOR
THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE MYTHOLOGY OF GREECE.
We must never deduce the etymology of an Egyptian or oriental term from the Greek language. Eustathius well observes, Ει βαρβαρον το ονομα ου χρη ζητειν Ἑλληνικην ετυμολογιαν αυτου.
We should recur to the Doric manner of expression, as being nearest to the original.
The Greeks adopted all foreign history: and supposed it to have been of their own country.
They mistook temples for Deities, and places for persons.
They changed every foreign term to something similar in their own language; to something similar in sound, however remote in meaning; being led solely by the ear.
They constantly mistook titles for names; and from these titles multiplied their Deities and Heroes.
All terms of relation between the Deities to be disregarded.
As the Grecians were mistaken, it is worth our while to observe the mode of error and uniformity of mistake. By attending to this, we may bring things back to their primitive state, and descry in antient terms the original meaning.
We must have regard to the oblique cases, especially in nouns imparasyllabic, when we have an antient term transmitted to us either from the Greeks or Romans. The nominative, in both languages, is often abridged; so that, from the genitive of the word, or from the possessive, the original term is to be deduced. This will be found to obtain even in common names. From veteris



we have veter for the true term; from sanguinis we have sanguen: and that this is right we may prove from Ennius, who says:
[565]O! pater, O! genitor, O! sanguen diis oriundum.
[566]Cum veter occubuit Priamus sub marte Pelasgo.
So mentis, and not mens, was the true nominative to mentis, menti, mentem; as we may learn from the same author:
[567]Istic est de sole sumptus ignis, isque mentis est.
In like manner Plebes was the nominative to Plebi and Plebem.
Deficit alma Ceres, nec plebes pane potitur. Lucilius.
All the common departments of the Deities are to be set aside, as inconsistent and idle. Pollux will be found a judge; Ceres, a law-giver; Bacchus, the God of the year; Neptune, a physician; and Æsculapius, the God of thunder: and this not merely from the poets; but from the best mythologists of the Grecians, from those who wrote professedly upon the subject.
I have observed before, that the Grecians in foreign words often changed the Nu final to Sigma. For Keren, they wrote Κερας; for Cohen, Κωης; for Athon, Αθως; for Boun, Βους; for Sain, Σαϊς.
People, of old, were styled the children of the God whom they worshipped: hence they were, at last, thought to have been his real offspring; and he was looked up to as the true parent. On the contrary, Priests were represented as foster-fathers to the Deity before whom they ministered; and Priestesses were styled τιθηναι, or nurses.
Colonies always went out under the patronage and title of some Deity. This conducting-God was in after-times supposed to have been the real leader.
Sometimes the whole merit of a transaction was imputed to this Deity solely; who was represented under the character of Perseus, Dionusus, or Hercules. Hence, instead of one person, we must put a people; and the history will be found consonant to the truth.
As the Grecians made themselves principals in many great occurrences which were of another country, we must look abroad for the original, both of their rites and mythology; and apply to the nations from whence they were derived. Their original history was foreign, and ingrafted upon the history of the country where they settled. This is of great consequence, and repeatedly to be considered.
One great mistake frequently prevails among people who deal in these researches, which must be carefully avoided. We should never make use of a language which is modern, or comparatively modern, to deduce the etymology of antient and primitive terms. Pezron applies to the modern Teutonic, which he styles the Celtic, and says, was the language of Jupiter. But who was Jupiter, and what has the modern Celtic to do with the history of Egypt or Chaldea? There was an interval of two thousand years between the times of which he treats and any history of the Celtæ: and there is still an interval, not very much inferior to the former, before we arrive at the æra of the language to which he applies.
It has been the custom of those writers, who have been versed in the Oriental languages, to deduce their etymologies from roots; which are often some portion of a verb. But the names of places and of persons are generally an assemblage of qualities and titles; such as I have exhibited in the treatise above; and I believe were never formed by such evolutions. The terms were obvious, and in common use; taken from some well-known characteristics. Those who imposed such names never thought of a root; and, probably, did not know the purport of the term. Whoever, therefore, in etymology, has recourse to this method of investigation, seems to me to act like a person who should seek at the fountain-head for a city which stood at the mouth of a river.
A



SHORT ACCOUNT
OF THE
HELLADIANS,
AND THEIR ORIGIN;
In order to obviate some Objections.
As I have mentioned that the Helladians came from Egypt, and the east; it may be proper to obviate an objection which may be made, to the account I give; as if it were contradictory to the tenor of the scriptures, as they are in general understood. Greece, and the islands of Greece, are
continually supposed, from the account given by Moses[568], to have been peopled by the sons of Japhet; and there is scarce any body, either antient or modern, who has touched upon this subject, but has imagined Javan to have been the same as Ion, the son of Xuth, from whom the Ionians were descended. This latter point I shall not controvert at present. In respect to the former, the account given in the scriptures is undoubtedly most true. The sons of Japhet did people the isles of the Gentiles; by which is meant the regions of Greece and Europe, separated in great measure from the Asiatic continent by the intervention of the sea. They certainly were the first inhabitants of those countries. But the Helladians, though by family Ionians, were not of this race. They came afterwards; and all their best writers agree, that when their ancestors made their way into these provinces, they were possessed by a prior people. Who these were is no where uniformly said: only they agree to term them in general Βαρβαροι, or a rude, uncivilized people. As my system depends greatly upon this point; to take away every prejudice to my opinion, I will in some degree anticipate, what I shall hereafter more fully prove. I accordingly submit to the reader the following evidences; which are comparatively few, if we consider what might be brought to this purpose. These are to shew, that the Helladians were of a different race from the sons of Japhet: and that the country, when they came to it, was in the possession of another people: which people they distinguished from themselves by the title of Βαρβαροι.

It is said of Cadmus, that he came originally from Egypt, in company with Phœnix. Καδμος και Φοινιξ απο Θηβων των Αιγυπτιων. Euseb. Chron. p. 15.
Eusebius in another place mentions the arrival of Cadmus with a company of Saïtæ. They founded Athens, the principal city of Greece: also Thebes in Bœotia. They were of Egypt; but he says, that they came last from Sidon. It is in a passage, where he speaks of a former race in Attica before those of Egypt called Saïtæ: Πλην των μετοικησαντων ὑστερον εκει Σαϊτων, και κατοικησαντων την της Ἑλλαδος μητροπολιν Αθηνας, και τας Θηβας. Σιδωνιων γαρ ὁυτοι αποικοι εκ Καδμου του Αγηνορος. Chron. p. 14. The antient Athenians worshipped
Isis: and were in their looks, and in their manners particularly like the Egyptians. Και ταις
ιδεαις, και τοις ηθεσιν ὁμοιοτατους ειναι τοις Αιγυπτιοις. The whole of their polity was plainly borrowed from that country. Diod. Sic. l. 1: p. 24, 25, 26.
It is said by Sanchoniathon, that Cronus, in his travels over the earth in company with his daughter Athena, came to Attica; which he bestowed upon her. Euseb. P. E. lib. 1. c. 10. p. 38.
This is not unlike the account given by the Scholiast upon Lycophron concerning Cecrops: from whence the legend may receive some light. Ελθων αρ' (ὁ Κεκροψ) απο Σαεως πολεως Αιγυπτου τας Αθηνας συνῳκισε. Σαϊς δε κατ' Αιγυπτιους ἡ Αθηνα λεγεται, ὡς φησιν Χαραξ. Lycoph. v. 111. Schol.
Hence it is, that almost the whole of the mythology of Greece is borrowed from Egypt. Καθολου δε, φησι, τους Ἑλληνας εξιδιασεσθαι τους επιφανεστατους Αιγυπτιων Ἡρωας τε, και Θεους. Diodorus. l. 1. p. 20. All their rites and ceremonies were from the same quarter.

Και παντα τα ουνοματα των Θεων εξ Αιγυπτου εληλυθε ες την Ἑλλαδα. Herod. l. 2. c. 50. Hence it is said that the Corybantes, with their mother Comba, came and settled at Athens: Κομβης ἑπτατοκου μετα μητερος. Nonni Dionys. l. 13. And that the priests at Athens, styled Eumolpidæ, were from Egypt. Diodorus Siculus. l. 1. p. 25. One of the Egyptians, who brought these rites to Greece, is mentioned under the name of Melampus: as the Egyptians are, in general,



under the character of Melampodes. Ἑλλησι γαρ δη Μελαμπους εστιν, ὁ εξηγησαμενος του Διονυσου ονομα, και την Θυσιαν, και την πομπην του φαλλου. Herod. l. 2. c. 49. He is likewise said to have first introduced physic: by which this only is meant, that physic too came from Egypt.

A
NEW SYSTEM
OR AN
ANALYSIS
OF
ANTIENT MYTHOLOGY.
OF
ANTIENT WORSHIP,
AND OF
ETYMOLOGICAL TRUTHS
THENCE DEDUCIBLE:
EXEMPLIFIED IN THE NAMES OF CITIES, LAKES, AND RIVERS.
Εστι που και ποταμοις τιμη, η κατ' ωφελειαν, ὡσπερ Αιγυπτιοις προς τον Νειλον, η κατα καλλος, ὡς Θετταλοις προς Πηνειον, η κατα μεγεθος, ὡς Σκυθαις προς τον Ιστρον, η κατα μυθον, ὡς Αιτωλοις προς τον Αχελωον. ——M . T . Dissert. viii. p. 81.
As the divine honours paid to the Sun, and the adoration of fire, were at one time almost universal, there will be found in most places a similitude in the terms of worship. And though this mode of idolatry took its rise in one particular part of the world, yet, as it was propagated to others far remote, the stream, however widely diffused, will still savour of the fountain. Moreover, as people were determined in the choice of their holy places by those preternatural phænomena, of which I have before taken notice; if there be any truth in my system, there will be uniformly found some analogy between the name of the temple, and its rites and situation: so that the etymology may be ascertained by the history of the place. The like will appear in respect to rivers and mountains; especially to those which were esteemed at all sacred, and which were denominated from the Sun and fire. I therefore flatter myself that the etymologies which I shall lay before the reader will not stand single and unsupported; but there will be an apparent analogy throughout the whole. The allusion will not be casual and remote, nor be obtained by undue inflexions and distortions: but, however complicated the name may appear, it will resolve itself easily into the



original terms; and, when resolved, the truth of the etymology will be ascertained by the concomitant history. If it be a Deity, or other personage, the truth will appear from his office and department; or with the attributes imputed to him. To begin, then, with antient Latium. If I should have occasion to speak of the Goddess Feronia, and of the city denominated from her, I should deduce the from Fer-On, ignis Dei Solis; and suppose the place to have been addicted to the worship of the Sun, and the rites of fire. I accordingly find, from Strabo and Pliny, that rites of this sort were practised here: and one custom, which remained even to the time of Augustus, consisted
in a ceremony of the priests, who used to walk barefoot over burning coals: [569]Γυμνοις γαρ
ποσι διεξιασιν ανθρακιαν, και σποδιαν μεγαλην. The priests, with their feet naked, walked over a large quantity of live coals and cinders. The town stood at the bottom of Mount Soracte, sacred to Apollo; and the priests were styled Hirpi. Aruns, in Virgil, in his address to Apollo, takes notice of this custom:
[570]Summe Deûm, magni custos Soractis, Apollo, Quem primi colimus; cui pineus ardor acervo Pascitur, et medium freti pietate per ignem Cultores multâ premimus vestigia prunâ; Da, Pater.
The temple is said to have been founded on account of a pestilential [571]vapour, which arose from a cavern; and to which some shepherds were conducted by (Λυκος) a wolf. Were I to attempt the decyphering of Ferentum, I should proceed in a manner analogous to that above. I should suppose it to have been named Fer-En, ignis, vel Solis fons, from something peculiar either in its rites or situation. I accordingly find, that there was a sacred fountain, whose waters were styled Aquæ
Ferentinæ,—cui numen etiam, et divinus cultus tributus [572]fuit. Here was a grove, equally
sacred, mentioned by [573] Livy, and others; where the antient Latines used to hold their chief assemblies. As this grand meeting used to be in a place denominated from fire, it was the cause of those councils being called Feriæ Latinæ. The fountain, which ran through the grove, arose at the
foot of mount [574]Albanus, and afterwards formed many [575]pools.
The antient Cuthites, and the Persians after them, had a great veneration for fountains and streams; which also prevailed among other nations, so as to have been at one time almost
universal. Of this regard among the Persians Herodotus takes notice: [576]Σεβονται ποταμους
των παντων μαλιστα: Of all things in nature they reverence rivers most. But if these rivers were attended with any nitrous or saline quality, or with any fiery eruption, they were adjudged to be still more sacred, and ever distinguished with some title of the Deity. The natives of Egypt had
the like veneration. Other nations, says [577]Athanasius, reverenced rivers and fountains; but, above all people in the world, the Egyptians held them in the highest honour, and esteemed them
as divine. Julius Firmicus gives the same account of them. [578]Ægyptii aquæ beneficium percipientes aquam colunt, aquis supplicant. From hence the custom passed westward to Greece, Italy, and the extremities of Europe. In proof of which the following inscription is to be found in Gruter:
[579]Vascaniæ in Hispaniâ FONTI DIVINO.
How much it prevailed among the Romans we learn from Seneca. [580]Magnorum fluviorum capita veneramur—coluntur aquarum calentium fontes; et quædam stagna, quæ vel opacitas, vel immensa altitudo sacravit. It mattered not what the nature of the water might be, if it had a peculiar quality. At Thebes, in Ammonia, was a fountain, which was said to have been cold by
day, and warm at night. Ἡ κρηνη [581]καλειται του ἡλιου. It was named the fountain of the Sun. In Campania was a fountain Virena; which I should judge to be a compound of Vir-En, and to signify ignis fons, from being dedicated to the Deity of fire, on account of some particular
quality. I accordingly find in [582]Vitruvius, that it was a medicinal spring, and of a strong vitriolic
nature. The Corinthians had in their Acropolis a [583]Pirene, of the same purport as Virena, just
mentioned. It was a beautiful fountain sacred to Apollo, whose [584]image was at the head of the water within a sacred inclosure.
We read of a Pyrene, which was a fountain of another nature; yet of the same etymology, however differently expressed. It was a mountain, and gave name to the vast ridge called Saltus Pyrenæi. It



is undoubtedly a compound of
[585]
Pur-ain, and signifies a fountain of fire. I should imagine, without knowing the history of the country, that this mountain once flamed; and that the name was given from this circumstance. Agreeably to this, I find, from Aristotle de Mirabilibus, that here was formerly an eruption of fire. The same is mentioned by Posidonius in Strabo; and also by
Diodorus, who adds,
[586]
Τα μεν ορη δια το συμβεβηκος κληθηναι Πυρηναια. That the mountains from hence had the name of Pyrenæi. Mount Ætna is derived very truly by Bochart from Aituna, fornax; as being a reservoir of molten matter. There was another very antient name, Inessus; by which the natives called the hill, as well as the city, which was towards the bottom of it. The name is a compound of Ain-Es, like Hanes in Egypt; and signifies a fountain of fire. It is called Ennesia by Diodorus, who says that this name was afterwards changed to Ætna. He speaks of the city; but the name was undoubtedly borrowed from the mountain, to which it was primarily
applicable, and upon which it was originally conferred:
[587]
Και την νυν ουσαν Αιτνην εκτησαντο, προ τουτου καλουμενην Εννησιαν. Strabo expresses the name Innesa, and
informs us, more precisely, that the upper part of the mountain was so called, Οι δε
[588]
Αιτναιοι παραχωρησαντες την Ιννησαν καλουμενην, της Αιτνης ορεινην, ᾡκησαν. Upon this, the people, withdrawing themselves, went and occupied the upper part of Mount Ætna, which was called Innesa. The city Hanes, in Egypt, was of the same etymology; being denominated from the Sun, who was styled Hanes. Ain-Es, fons ignis sive lucis. It was the same as the Arab Heliopolis, called now Mataiea. Stephanas Byzantinus calls the city Inys: for that is manifestly the name he
gives it, if we take away the Greek termination,
[589]
Ινυσσος, πολις Αιγυπτου: but Herodotus,
[590]
from whom he borrows, renders it Iënis. It would have been more truly rendered Doricè Iänis; for that was nearer to the real name. The historian, however, points it out plainly, by saying, that it
was three days journey from Mount
[591]
Casius; and that the whole way was through the Arabian desert. This is a situation which agrees with no other city in all Egypt, except that which was the Onium of the later Jews. With this it accords precisely. There seem to have been two cities named On, from the worship of the Sun. One was called Zan, Zon, and Zoan, in the land of Go-zan, the [592]
Goshen of the scriptures. The other was the city On in Arabia; called also Hanes. They were within eight or nine miles of each other, and are both mentioned together by the prophet [593]
Isaiah. For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes. The name of each of these cities, on account of the similarity of worship, has by the Greeks been translated [594]
Heliopolis; which has caused great confusion in the history of Egypt. The latter of the two was the Iänis, or Ιανισος, of the Greeks; so called from Hanes, the great fountain of light, the Sun; who was worshipped under that title by the Egyptians and Arabians. It lies now quite in ruins, close to the village Matarea, which has risen from it. The situation is so pointed out, that we cannot be mistaken: and we find, moreover, which is a circumstance very remarkable, that it is at this day called by the Arabians Ain El Sham, the fountain of the Sun; a name precisely of the same purport as Hanes. Of this we are informed by the learned geographer, D'Anville, and others;
though the name, by different travellers, is expressed with some variation.
[595]
Cette ville presque ensévelie sous des ruines, et voisine, dit Abulfeda, d'un petit lieu nommé Matarea, conserve dans les géographies Arabes le nom d'Ainsiems ou du fontain du Soleil. A like account is given by
Egmont and
[596]
Hayman; though they express the name Ain El Cham; a variation of little consequence. The reason why the antient name has been laid aside, by those who reside there, is undoubtedly this. Bochart tells us, that, since the religion of Mahomet has taken place, the Arabs
look upon Hanes as the devil:
[597]
proinde ab ipsis ipse Dæmon הנאס vocatur. Hence they have abolished Hanes: but the name Ain El Cham, of the same purport, they have suffered to remain.
I have before taken notice of an objection liable to be made from a supposition, that if Hanes signified the fountain of light, as I have presumed, it would have been differently expressed in the Hebrew. This is a strange fallacy; but yet very predominant. Without doubt those learned men, who have preceded in these researches, would have bid fair for noble discoveries, had they not been too limited, and biassed, in their notions. But as far as I am able to judge, most of those, who have engaged in inquiries of this nature, have ruined the purport of their labours through some prevailing prejudice. They have not considered, that every other nation, to which we can possibly gain access, or from whom we have any history derived, appears to have expressed foreign terms differently from the natives, in whose language they were found. And without a miracle the Hebrews must have done the same. We pronounce all French names differently from the people of that country: and they do the same in respect to us. What we call London, they express Londres: England they style Angleterre. What some call Bazil, they pronounce Bal: Munchen, Munich: Mentz, Mayence: Ravenspurg, Ratisbon. The like variation was observable of old. Carthago of the Romans was Carchedon among the Greeks. Hannibal was rendered Annibas: Asdrubal,



Asdroubas: and probably neither was consonant to the Punic mode of expression. If then a prophet were to rise from the dead, and preach to any nation, he would make use of terms adapted to their idiom and usage; without any retrospect to the original of the terms, whether they were domestic, or foreign. The sacred writers undoubtedly observed this rule towards the people, for whom they wrote; and varied in their expressing of foreign terms; as the usage of the people varied. For the Jewish nation at times differed from its neighbours, and from itself. We may be morally certain, that the place, rendered by them Ekron, was by the natives called Achoron; the Accaron, Ακκαρων, of Josephus, and the Seventy. What they termed Philistim, was Pelestin: Eleazar, in
their own language, they changed to Lazar, and Lazarus: and of the Greek συνεδριον they formed Sanhedrim. Hence we may be certified, that the Jews, and their ancestors, as well as all nations upon earth, were liable to express foreign terms with a variation, being led by a natural peculiarity in their mode of speech. They therefore are surely to be blamed, who would deduce the orthography of all antient words from the Hebrew; and bring every extraneous term to that test. It requires no great insight into that language to see the impropriety of such procedure. Yet no
prejudice has been more [598]common. The learned Michaelis has taken notice of this [599]fatal attachment, and speaks of it as a strange illusion. He says, that it is the reigning influenza, to which all are liable, who make the Hebrew their principal study. The only way to obtain the latent purport of antient terms is by a fair analysis. This must be discovered by an apparent analogy; and supported by the history of the place, or person, to whom the terms relate. If such helps can be obtained, we may determine very truly the etymology of an Egyptian or Syriac name; however it may appear repugnant to the orthography of the Hebrews. The term Hanes is not so uncommon as may be imagined. Zeus was worshipped under this title in Greece, and styled Ζευς Αινησιος.
The Scholiast upon Apollonius Rhodius mentions his temple, and terms it [600]Διος Αινησιου ἱερον ου μνημονευει και Λεων εν περιπλῳ, και Δημοσθενης εν λιμεσι. It is also taken
notice of by Strabo, who speaks of a mountain Hanes, where the temple stood. [601]Μεγιστον δε
ορος εν αυτῃ Αινος (lege Αινης) εν ᾡ το του Διος Αινησιου ἱερον. The mountain of Zeus Ainesius must have been Aines, and not Ainos; though it occurs so in our present copies of Strabo. The Scholiast above quotes a verse from Hesiod, where the Poet styles the Deity Αινηιος.
Ενθ' ὁιγ' ευχεσθην Αινηιῳ ὑψιμεδοντι.
Aineïus, and Ainesius are both alike from Hanes, the Deity of Egypt, whose rites may be traced in various parts. There were places named Aineas, and Ainesia in Thrace; which are of the same original. This title occurs sometimes with the prefix Ph'anes: and the Deity so called was by the early theologists thought to have been of the highest antiquity. They esteemed him the same as
[602]Ouranus, and Dionusus: and went so far as to give him a creative [603]power, and to deduce all things from him. The Grecians from Phanes formed Φαναιος, which they gave as a title both
to [604]Zeus, and Apollo. In this there was nothing extraordinary, for they were both the same
God. In the north of Italy was a district called Ager [605]Pisanus. The etymology of this name is the same as that of Hanes, and Phanes; only the terms are reversed. It signifies ignis fons: and in confirmation of this etymology I have found the place to have been famous for its hot streams, which are mentioned by Pliny under the name of Aquæ Pisanæ. Cuma in Campania was certainly
denominated from Chum, heat, on account of its soil, and situation. Its medicinal [606]waters are well known; which were called Aquæ Cumanæ. The term Cumana is not formed merely by a Latine inflection; but consists of the terms Cumain, and signifies a hot fountain; or a fountain of Chum, or Cham, the Sun. The country about it was called Phlegra; and its waters are mentioned by Lucretius.
[607]Qualis apud Cumas locus est, montemque Vesevum, Oppleti calidis ubi fumant fontibus auctus.
Here was a cavern, which of old was a place of prophecy. It was the seat of the Sibylla Cumana,
who was supposed to have come from [608]Babylonia. As Cuma was properly Cuman; so Baiæ
was Baian; and Alba near mount Albanus[609], Alban: for the Romans often dropped the n final. Pisa, so celebrated in Elis, was originally Pisan, of the same purport as the Aquæ Pisanæ above. It was so called from a sacred fountain, to which only the name can be primarily applicable: and we
are assured by Strabo [610]Την κρηνην Πισαν ειρησθαι, that the fountain had certainly the name of Pisan. I have mentioned that Mount Pyrene was so called from being a fountain of fire: such mountains often have hot streams in their vicinity, which are generally of great utility. Such we find to have been in Aquitania at the foot of this mountain, which were called Thermæ Onesæ;



and are mentioned by Strabo, as [611]Θερμα καλλιστα ποτιμωτατου ὑδατος. What in one part of the world was termed Cumana, was in another rendered Comana. There was a grand city of this name in Cappadocia, where stood one of the noblest Puratheia in Asia. The Deity worshipped was represented as a feminine, and styled Anait, and Anaïs; which latter is the same as Hanes. She was well known also in Persis, Mesopotamia, and at Egbatana in Media. Both Anait, and An-ais, signifies a fountain of fire. Generally near her temples, there was an eruption of that element; particularly at Egbatana, and Arbela. Of the latter Strabo gives an account, and of the fiery matter which was near it. [612]Περι Αρβηλα δε εστι και Δημητριας πολις· ειθ' ἡ του ναφθα πηγη, και τα πυρα (or πυρεια) και το της Αναιας ἱερον.
I should take the town of Egnatia in Italy to have been of the same purport as Hanes above mentioned: for Hanes was sometimes expressed with a guttural, Hagnes; from whence came the ignis of the Romans. In Arcadia near mount Lyceus was a sacred fountain; into which one of the nymphs, which nursed Jupiter, was supposed to have been changed. It was called Hagnon, the same as Ain-On, the fount of the Sun. From Ain of the Amonians, expressed Agn, came the ἁγνος of the Greeks, which signified any thing pure and clean; purus sive castus. Hence was derived ἁγνειον, πηγαιον· ἁγναιον, καθαρον· ἁγνη, καθαρα: as we may learn from
Hesychius. Pausanias styles the fountain [613]Hagno: but it was originally Hagnon, the fountain of the Sun: hence we learn in another place of Hesychius, ἁγνοπολεισθαι, το ὑπο ἡλιου
θερεσθαι. The town Egnatia, which I mentioned above, stood in campis Salentinii, and at this day is called Anazo, and Anazzo. It was so named from the rites of fire: and that those customs were here practised, we may learn from some remains of them among the natives in the times of
Horace and Pliny. The former calls the place by contraction [614]Gnatia:
Dein Gnatia Nymphis Iratis extructa dedit risumque, jocumque; Dum flammis sine thura liquescere limine sacro Persuadere cupit.
Horace speaks as if they had no fire: but according to Pliny they boasted of having a sacred and
spontaneous appearance of it in their temple. [615]Reperitur apud auctores in Salentino oppido Egnatiâ, imposito ligno in saxum quoddam ibi sacram protinus flammam existere. From hence, undoubtedly, came also the name of Salentum, which is a compound of Sal-En, Solis fons; and arose from this sacred fire to which the Salentini pretended. They were Amonians, who settled
here, and who came last from Crete [616]Τους δε Σαλεντινους Κρητων αποικους φασι. Innumerable instances of this sort might be brought from Sicily: for this island abounded with places, which were of Amonian original. Thucydides and other Greek writers, call them Phenicians[617]: Ωκουν δε και Φοινικες περι πασαν μεν Σικελιαν. But they were a different people from those, which he supposes. Besides, the term Phenician was not a name, but a title: which was assumed by people of different parts; as I shall shew. The district, upon which the Grecians conferred it, could not have supplied people sufficient to occupy the many regions, which the Phenicians were supposed to have possessed. It was an appellation, by which no part of Canaan was called by the antient and true inhabitants: nor was it ever admitted, and in use, till the Grecians got possession of the coast. It was even then limited to a small tract; to the coast of Tyre and Sidon.
If so many instances may be obtained from the west, many more will be found, as we proceed towards the east; from whence these terms were originally derived. Almost all the places in Greece were of oriental etymology; or at least from Egypt. I should suppose that the name of Methane in the Peloponnesus had some relation to a fountain, being compounded of Meth-an, the fountain of the Egyptian Deity, Meth, whom the Greeks called Μητις, Meetis.
[618]Και Μητις πρωτος γενετωρ, και Ερως πολυτερπης.
We learn from [619]Pausanias, that there was in this place a temple and a statue of Isis, and a statue also of Hermes in the forum; and that it was situated near some hot springs. We may from hence form a judgment, why this name was given, and from what country it was imported. We find this
term sometimes compounded Meth-On, of which name there was a town in [620]Messenia. Instances to our purpose from Greece will accrue continually in the course of our work.



One reason for holding waters so sacred arose from a notion, that they were gifted with supernatural powers. Jamblichus takes notice of many ways, by which the gift of divination was
to be obtained. [621]Some, says he, procure a prophetic spirit by drinking the sacred water, as is the practice of Apollo's priest at Colophon. Some by sitting over the mouth of the cavern, as the women do, who give out oracles at Delphi. Others are inspired by the vapour, which arises from
the waters; as is the case of those who are priestesses at Branchidæ. He adds,[622] in respect to the oracle at Colophon, that the prophetic spirit was supposed to proceed from the water. The fountain, from whence it flowed, was in an apartment under ground; and the priest went thither to partake of the emanation. From this history of the place we may learn the purport of the name, by which this oracular place was called. Colophon is Col-Oph On, tumulus Dei Solis Pythonis, and corresponds with the character given. The river, into which this fountain ran, was sacred, and
named Halesus; it was also called [623]Anelon: An-El-On, Fons Dei Solis. Halesus is composed of well-known titles of the same God.
Delos was famed for its oracle; and for a fountain sacred to the prophetic Deity. It was called
[624]Inopus. This is a plain compound of Ain-Opus, Fons Pythonis. Places named Asopus, Elopus, and like, are of the same analogy. The God of light, Orus, was often styled Az-El; whence we meet with many places named Azelis, Azilis, Azila, and by apocope, Zelis, Zela, and Zeleia. In
Lycia was the city Phaselis, situated upon the mountain [625]Chimæra; which mountain had the same name, and was sacred to the God of fire. Phaselis is a compound of Phi, which, in the Amonian language, is a mouth or opening; and of Azel above mentioned. Ph'Aselis signifies Os Vulcani, sive apertura ignis; in other words a chasm of fire. The reason why this name was
imposed may be seen in the history of the place[626]. Flagrat in Phaselitide Mons Chimæra, et quidem immortali diebus, et noctibus flammâ. Chimæra is a compound of Cham-Ur, the name of
the Deity, whose altar stood towards the top of the [627]mountain. At no great distance stood Mount Argaius, which was a part of the great ridge, called Taurus. This Argaius may be either derived from Har, a mountain; or from Aur, fire. We may suppose Argaius to signify Mons cavus: or rather ignis cavitas, sive Vulcani domus, a name given from its being hollow, and at the same time a reservoir of fiery matter. The history of the mountain may be seen in Strabo; who says, that it was immensely high, and ever covered with snow; it stood in the vicinity of Comana, Castabala,
Cæsarea, and Tyana: and all the country about it abounded with fiery [628]eruptions. But the most satisfactory idea of this mountain may be obtained from coins, which were struck in its vicinity;
and particularly [629]describe it, both as an hollow and an inflamed mountain.
In Thrace was a region called Pæonia, which seems to have had its name from P'Eon, the God of
light[630]. The natives of these parts were styled both Peonians and Pierians; which names equally relate to the Sun. Agreeably to this Maximus Tyrius tells us, that they particularly worshipped that luminary: and adds, that they had no image; but instead of it used to suspend upon an high pole a disk of metal, probably of fine gold, as they were rich in that mineral: and before this they
performed their [631]adoration.
There is an apparent analogy between the names of places farther east; whose inhabitants were all worshippers of the Sun. Hence most names are an assemblage of his titles. Such is Cyrestia, Chalybon, Comana, Ancura, Cocalia, Cabyra, Arbela, Amida, Emesa, Edessa, and the like. Emesa is a compound of Ham-Es: the natives are said by Festus Avienus to have been devoted to the Sun:
[632]Denique flammicomo devoti pectora Soli Vitam agitant.
Similar to Emesa was Edessa, or more properly Adesa, so named from Hades, the God of light.
The emperor Julian styles the region—Ἱερον εξ αιωνος τῳ Ἡλιῳ [633]Χωριον. This city was
also, from its worship, styled [634]Ur, Urhoe, and Urchoë; which last was probably the name of the
[635]temple.
There were many places called Arsene, Arsine, Arsinoë, Arsiana. These were all the same name, only varied in different countries; and they were consequently of the same purport. Arsinoë is a compound of arez-ain, Solis fons: and most places so denominated will be found famed for some fountain. One of this name was in Syria; [636]Αρσινοη πολις εν Συριᾳ, επι βουνῳ κειμενη.
απο δε του βουνου κρηνας ερευγεται πλειονας—αφ' ὡν ἡ πολις ωνομασται. Arsinoë is a city in Syria, situated upon a rising ground, out of which issue many streams: from hence the



city had its name. Arsine and Arsiana in Babylonia had [637]fountains of bitumen. Arsene in
Armenia was a nitrous lake: [638]Αρσηνη λιμην—νιτριτις. Near Arsinoë, upon the Red Sea,
were hot streams of bitter [639]waters; and Arsinoë near [640]Ephesus had waters equally bitter.
There were many people called Hyrcani; and cities and regions, Hyrcania: in the history of which there will be uniformly found some reference to fire. The name is a compound of Ur-chane, the God of that element. He was worshipped particularly at Ur, in Chaldea: and one tribe of that
nation were called Urchani. Strabo mentions them as only one branch of the [641]literati; but
[642]Pliny speaks of them as a people, a tribe of the Chaldeans. Here was the source of fire
worship: and all the country was replete with bitumen and fire. There was a region [643]Hyrcania, inhabited by the Medes; which seems to have been of the same inflammable nature. The people were called Hyrcani, and Astabeni: which latter signifies the sons of fire. Celiarius mentions a city
Hyrcania in [644]Lydia. There were certainly people styled Hyrcani; and a large plain called
Campus Hyrcanus [645] in the same part of the world. It seems to have been a part of that parched and burning region called κατακεκαυμενη, so named from the fires with which it abounded. It was near Hierapolis, Caroura, and Fossa Charonea; all famed for fire.
It may seem extraordinary, yet I cannot help thinking, that the Hercynian forest in Germany was no other than the Hurcanian, and that it was denominated from the God Urcan, who was worshipped here as well as in the east. It is mentioned by Eratosthenes and Ptolemy, under the
name of δρυμος Ορκυνιος, or the forest of [646]Orcun; which is, undoubtedly, the same name as that above. I have taken notice, that the name of the mountain Pyrene signified a fountain of fire,
and that the mountain had once flamed. There was a Pyrene among the Alpes [647]Tridentini, and
at the foot of it a city of the same [648]name; which one would infer to have been so denominated from the like circumstance. I mention this, because here was the regio Hercynia, where the
Hercynian forest[649] commenced, and from which it received its name. Beatus Rhenanus, in his
account of these parts, says, that there was a tradition of this mountain Pyrene once[650] burning:
and, conformably to this notion, it is still distinguished by the name of the great [651]Brenner. The country, therefore, and the forest may have been called Orcunian upon this account. For as the worship of the Sun, the Deity of fire, prevailed greatly at places of this nature, I make no doubt but Hercynia, which Ptolemy expresses Ορκυνια was so named from Or-cun, the God of that element.
We must not be surprised to find Amonian names among the Alpes; for some of that family were the first who passed them. The merit of great performances was by the Greeks generally attributed to a single person. This passage therefore through the mountains is said by some to have been the
work of Hercules: by others of Cottus, and [652]Cottius. From hence this particular branch of the mountains had the name of Alpes Cottiae; and the country was called Regio Cottiana: wherein
were about twelve capital [653]cities. Some of that antient and sacred nation, the Hyperboreans,
are said by Posidonius to have taken up their residence in these parts. [654]Τους Ὑπερβορεους
—οικειν περι τας Αλπεις της Ιταλιας. Here inhabited the Taurini: and one of the chief cities
was Comus. Strabo styles the country the land of [655]Ideonus, and Cottius. These names will be found hereafter to be very remarkable. Indeed many of the Alpine appellations were Amonian; as were also their rites: and the like is to be observed in many parts of Gaul, Britain, and Germany. Among other evidences the worship of Isis, and of her sacred ship, is to be noted; which prevailed
among the Suevi. [656]Pars Suevorum et Isidi sacrificat: unde causa et origo peregrino sacro, parum comperi; nisi quod signum ipsum in modum Liburnæ figuratum docet advectam
religionem. The ship of Isis was also reverenced at Rome: and is marked in the [657]calendar for
the month of March. From whence the mystery was derived, we may learn from [658]Fulgentius. Navigium Isidis Ægyptus colit. Hence we find, that the whole of it came from Egypt. The like is
shewn by [659]Lactantius. To this purpose I could bring innumerable proofs, were I not limited in my progress. I may perhaps hereafter introduce something upon this head, if I should at any time touch upon the antiquities of Britain and Ireland; which seem to have been but imperfectly known. Both of these countries, but especially the latter, abound with sacred terms, which have been greatly overlooked. I will therefore say so much in furtherance of the British Antiquarian, as to inform him, that names of places, especially of hills, promontories, and rivers, are of long duration; and suffer little change. The same may be said of every thing, which was esteemed at all sacred, such as temples, towers, and high mounds of earth; which in early times were used for altars. More particularly all mineral and medicinal waters will be found in a great degree to retain



their antient names: and among these there may be observed a resemblance in most parts of the world. For when names have been once determinately affixed, they are not easily effaced. The Grecians, who under Alexander settled in Syria, and Mesopotamia, changed many names of places, and gave to others inflections, and terminations after the mode of their own country. But Marcellinus, who was in those parts under the Emperor Julian, assures us, that these changes and variations were all cancelled: and that in his time the antient names prevailed. Every body, I presume, is acquainted with the history of Palmyra, and of Zenobia the queen; who having been conquered by the emperor Aurelian, was afterwards led in triumph. How much that city was beautified by this princess, and by those of her family, may be known by the stately ruins which are still extant. Yet I have been assured by my late excellent and learned friend Mr. Wood, that if you were to mention Palmyra to an Arab upon the spot, he would not know to what you alluded: nor would you find him at all more acquainted with the history of Odænatus, and Zenobia. Instead of Palmyra he would talk of Tedmor; and in lieu of Zenobia he would tell you, that it was built by Salmah Ebn Doud, that is by Solomon the son of David. This is exactly conformable to the
account in the scriptures: for it is said in the Book of Chronicles, [660]He also (Solomon) built Tadmor in the wilderness. The Grecian name Palmyra, probably of two thousand years standing, is novel to a native Arab.
As it appeared to me necessary to give some account of the rites, and worship, in the first ages, at least in respect to that great family, with which I shall be principally concerned, I took this opportunity at the same time to introduce these etymological inquiries. This I have done to the intent that the reader may at first setting out see the true nature of my system; and my method of investigation. He will hereby be able to judge beforehand of the scope which I pursue; and of the terms on which I found my analysis. If it should appear that the grounds, on which I proceed, are good, and my method clear, and warrantable, the subsequent histories will in consequence of it receive great illustration. But should it be my misfortune to have my system thought precarious, or contrary to the truth, let it be placed to no account, but be totally set aside: as the history will speak for itself; and may without these helps be authenticated.

OF
WORSHIP PAID AT CAVERNS;



AND OF
THE ADORATION OF FIRE
IN THE
FIRST AGES.
As soon as religion began to lose its purity, it degenerated very fast; and, instead of a reverential awe and pleasing sense of duty, there succeeded a fearful gloom and unnatural horror, which were continually augmented as superstition increased. Men repaired in the first ages either to the lonely summits of mountains, or else to caverns in the rocks, and hollows in the bosom of the earth; which they thought were the residence of their Gods. At the entrance of these they raised their altars and performed their vows. Porphyry takes notice how much this mode of worship prevailed among the first nations upon the earth: [661]Σπηλαια τοινυν και αντρα των παλαιοτατων, πριν και ναους επινοησαι, θεοις αφοσιουντων και εν Κρητῃ μεν Κουρητων Διι, εν Αρκαδιᾳ δε Σεληνῃ, και Πανι εν Λυκειῳ και εν Ναξῳ Διονυσῳ. When in process of time they began to erect temples, they were still determined in their situation by the vicinity of these objects, which they comprehended within the limits of the sacred inclosure. These melancholy recesses were esteemed the places of the highest sanctity: and so greatly did this notion prevail, that, in aftertimes, when this practice had ceased, still the innermost part of the temple was denominated the cavern. Hence the Scholiast upon Lycophron interprets the words παρ' αντρα
in the poet, [662]Τους εσωτατους τοπους του ναου. The cavern is the innermost place of the temple. Pausanias, speaking of a cavern in Phocis, says, that it was particularly sacred to
Aphrodite. [663]Αφροδιτη δ' εχει εν σπηλαιῳ τιμας. In this cavern divine honours were paid to Aphrodite. Parnassus was rendered holy for nothing more than for these unpromising circumstances. Ἱεροπρεπης ὁ Παρνασσος, εχων αντρα τε και αλλα χωρια τιμωμενα τε,
και, ἁγιστευομενα.[664] The mountain of Parnassus is a place of great reverence; having many caverns, and other detached spots, highly honoured and sanctified. At Tænarus was a temple with a fearful aperture, through which it was fabled that Hercules dragged to light the dog of hell. The
cave itself seems to have been the temple; for it is said, [665]Επι τῃ ακρᾳ Ναος εικασμενος
σπηλαιῳ. Upon the top of the promontory stands a temple, in appearance like a cavern. The situation of Delphi seems to have been determined on account of a mighty chasm in the hill,
[666]οντος χασματος εν τῳ τοπῳ: and Apollo is said to have chosen it for an oracular shrine, on account of the effluvia which from thence proceeded.
[667]Ut vidit Pæan vastos telluris hiatus Divinam spirare fidem, ventosque loquaces Exhalare solum, sacris se condidit antris, Incubuitque adyto: vates ibi factus Apollo.
Here also was the temple of the [668]Muses, which stood close upon a reeking stream. But, what rendered Delphi more remarkable, and more reverenced, was the Corycian cave, which lay between that hill and Parnassus. It went under ground a great way: and Pausanias, who made it his particular business to visit places of this nature, says, that it was the most extraordinary of any
which he ever beheld. [669]Αντρον Κωρυκιον σπηλαιων, ὡν ειδον, θεας αξιον μαλιστα. There were many caves styled Corycian: one in Cilicia, mentioned by Stephanus Byzantinus from Parthenius, who speaks of a city of the same name: Παρ' ᾑ το Κωρυκιον αντρον Νυμφων,
αξιαγαστον θεαμα. Near which city was the Corycian cavern, sacred to the nymphs, which
afforded a sight the most astonishing. There was a place of this sort at [670]Samacon, in Elis; and, like the above, consecrated to the nymphs. There were likewise medicinal waters, from which people troubled with cutaneous and scrofulous disorders found great benefit. I have mentioned the
temple at Hierapolis in [671]Phrygia; and the chasm within its precincts, out of which there issued
a pestilential vapour. There was a city of the same name in [672]Syria, where stood a temple of the highest antiquity; and in this temple was a fissure, through which, according to the tradition of the natives, the waters at the deluge retired. Innumerable instances might be produced to this purpose from Pausanias, Strabo, Pliny, and other writers.



It has been observed, that the Greek term κοιλος, hollow, was often substituted for Coëlus, heaven: and, I think, it will appear to have been thus used from the subsequent history, wherein the worship of the Atlantians is described. The mythologists gave out, that Atlas supported heaven: one reason for this notion was, that upon mount Atlas stood a temple to Coëlus. It is mentioned by Maximus Tyrius in one of his dissertations, and is here, as in many other instances, changed to κοιλος, hollow. The temple was undoubtedly a cavern: but the name is to be understood in its original acceptation, as Coël, the house of God; to which the natives paid their adoration. This mode of worship among the Atlantian betrays a great antiquity; as the temple seems to have been merely a vast hollow in the side of the mountain; and to have had in it neither
image, nor pillar, nor stone, nor any material object of adoration: [673]Εστι δε Ατλας ορος
κοιλον, επιεικως ὑψηλον.—Τουτο Λιβυων και ἱερον, και θεος, και ὁρκος, και αγαλμα. This Atlas (of which I have been speaking) is a mountain with a cavity, and of a tolerable height, which the natives esteem both as a temple and a Deity: and it is the great object by which they swear; and to which they pay their devotions. The cave in the mountain was certainly named Coel, the house of God; equivalent to Cœlus of the Romans. To this the people made their offerings: and this was the heaven which Atlas was supposed to support. It seems to have been no uncommon term among the Africans. There was a city in Libya named Coël, which the Romans rendered Coëlu. They would have expressed it Coelus, or Cœlus; but the name was copied in the time of the Punic wars, before the s final was admitted into their writings. Vaillant has given
several specimens of coins struck in this city to the honour of some of the Roman [674]emperors, but especially of Verus, Commodus, and Antoninus Pius.
Pl. II. Temple of Mithras near Naki Rustan in Persia. Also temples in the rock near the Plain of the Magi. From Le Bruyn.
Among the Persians most of the temples were caverns in rocks, either formed by nature, or artificially produced. They had likewise Puratheia, or open temples, for the celebration of the rites of fire. I shall hereafter shew, that the religion, of which I have been treating, was derived from the sons of Chus: and in the antient province of Chusistan, called afterwards Persis, there are to be seen at this day many curious monuments of antiquity, which have a reference to that worship.



The learned Hyde supposes them to have been either
[675]
palaces, or tombs. The chief building, which he has taken for a palace, is manifestly a Puratheion; one of those open edifices called by the Greeks Ὑπαιθρα. It is very like the temple at Lucorein in upper Egypt, and seems to be still entire. At a glance we may perceive, that it was never intended for an habitation. At a distance are some sacred grottos, hewn out of the rock; the same which he imagines to have been tombs. Many of the antients, as well as of the moderns, have been of the same opinion. In the front of these grottos are representations of various characters: and among others is figured, more than once, a
princely personage, who is approaching the altar where the sacred fire is
[676]
burning. Above all is the Sun, and the figure of a Deity in a cloud, with sometimes a sacred bandage, at other times a serpent entwined round his middle, similar to the Cnuphis of Egypt. Hyde supposes the figure above to be the soul of the king, who stands before the altar: but it is certainly an emblem of the
Deity, of which we have a second example in Le
[677]
Bruyn, copied from another part of these edifices. Hyde takes notice, that there were several repetitions of this history, and particularly of persons, solem et ignem in pariete delineatos intuentes: yet he forms his judgment from one
specimen only. These curious samples of antient architecture are described by
[678]
Kæmpfer, [679]
Mandesloe,
[680]
Chardin, and
[681]
Le Bruyn. They are likewise taken notice of by [682]
Thevenot, and Herbert. In respect to the grottos I am persuaded, that they were temples, and not tombs. Nothing was more common among the Persians than to have their temples formed out
of rocks. Mithras e
[683]
Petrâ was in a manner a proverb. Porphyry assures us, that the Deity had always a rock or cavern for his temple: that people, in all places, where the name of Mithras was
known, paid their worship at a
[684]
cavern. Justin Martyr speaks to the same
[685]
purpose: and
Lutatius Placidus mentions that this mode of worship began among the Persians,
[686]
Persæ in spelæis coli solem primi invenisse dicuntur. There is therefore no reason to think that these grottos were tombs; or that the Persians ever made use of such places for the sepulture of their kings. The
tombs of
[687]
Cyrus,
[688]
Nitocris, and other oriental princes, were within the precincts of their cities: from whence, as well as from the devices upon the entablatures of these grottos, we may be assured that they were designed for temples. Le Bruyn indeed supposes them to have been places of burial; which is very natural for a person to imagine, who was not acquainted with the antient
worship of the people. Thevenot also says, that he
[689]
went into the caverns, and saw several stone coffins. But this merely conjectural: for the things, to which he alludes, were not in the shape of coffins, and had undoubtedly been placed there as cisterns for water, which the Persians used in their nocturnal lustrations. This we may, in great measure, learn from his own words: for he says, that these reservoirs were square, and had a near resemblance to the basons of a fountain. The hills, where these grottos have been formed, are probably the same, which were of old famous for the strange echoes, and noises heard upon them. The circumstance is mentioned by
Clemens Alexandrinus
[690]
, who quotes it from the writers, who treated of the Persic history. It seems that there were some sacred hills in Persis, where, as people passed by, there were heard shouts, as of a multitude of people: also hymns and exultations, and other uncommon noises. These sounds undoubtedly proceeded from the priests at their midnight worship: whose voices at that season were reverberated by the mountains, and were accompanied with a reverential awe in those who heard them. The country below was called Χωρα των Μαγων, the region of the Magi.
The principal building also, which is thought to have been a palace, was a temple; but of a different sort. The travellers above say, that it is called Istachar: and Hyde repeats it, and tells us, that it signifies e rupe sumptum, seu rupe constans saxeum palatium: and that it is derived from
the Arabic word sachr, rupes, in the eighth
[691]
conjugation. I am sorry, that I am obliged to controvert this learned man's opinion, and to encounter him upon his own ground, about a point of oriental etymology. I am entirely a stranger to the Persic, and Arabic languages; yet I cannot acquiesce in his opinion. I do not think that the words e rupe sumptum, vel rupe constans saxeum palatium, are at any rate materials, out of which a proper name could be constructed. The place to be sure, whether a palace, or a temple, is built of stone taken from the quarry, or rock: but what temple or palace is not? Can we believe that they would give as a proper name to one place, what was in a manner common to all; and choose for a characteristic what was so general and indeterminate? It is not to be supposed. Every symbol, and representation relates to the worship of the country: and all history shews that such places were sacred, and set apart for the adoration of
fire, and the Deity of that element, called Ista, and Esta.
[692]
Ista-char, or Esta-char is the place or temple of Ista or Esta; who was the Hestia, Ἑστια, of the Greeks, and Vesta of the Romans. That
the term originally related to fire we have the authority of Petavius.
[693]
Hebraïcâ linguâ אש ignem significat, Aramæâ אשתא quâ voce ignem a Noëmo vocatum Berosus prodidit: atque inde fortassis



Græci Ἑστιας originem deduxerunt. Herbert, therefore, with great propriety, supposes the
building to have been the temple of [694]Anaia, or Anaïs; who was the same as Hanes, as well as Hestia. Procopius, speaking of the sacred fire of the Persians, says expressly, that it was the very same which in aftertimes the Romans worshipped, and called the fire of Hestia, or Vesta. [695]Τουτο εστι το πυρ, ὁπερ Ἑστιαν εκαλουντο, και εσεβοντο εν τοις ὑστεροις χρονοις Ρωμαιοι. This is farther proved from a well known verse in Ovid.
[696]Nec tu aliud Vestam, quam vivam intellige flammam.
Hyde renders the term after Kæmpfer, Ista: but it was more commonly expressed Esta, and Asta. The Deity was also styled Astachan, which as a masculine signified Sol Dominus, sive Vulcanus Rex. This we may infer from a province in Parthia, remarkable for eruptions of fire, which was
called [697]Asta-cana, rendered by the Romans Astacene, the region of the God of fire. The island Delos was famous for the worship of the sun: and we learn from Callimachus, that there were traditions of subterraneous fires bursting forth in many parts of it.
[698]Φυκος ἁπαν κατεφλεξας, επει περικαιεο πυρι.
Upon this account it was called [699]Pirpile; and by the same poet Histia, and Hestia, similar to the
name above. [700]Ιστιη, ω νησων ευεστιη. The antient Scythæ were worshippers of fire: and
Herodotus describes them as devoted to Histia[701]. Ἱλασκοντας Ἱστιην μεν μαλιστα. From hence, I think, we may know for certain the purport of the term Istachar, which was a name given to the grand Pureion in Chusistan from the Deity there worshipped. It stands near the bottom of the hills with the caverns in a widely-extended plain: which I make no doubt is the celebrated plain of the magi mentioned above by Clemens. We may from these data venture to correct a mistake in Maximus Tyrius, who in speaking of fire-worship among the Persians, says, that it was
attended with acclamations, in which they invited the Deity to take his repast[702]. Πυρ,
δεσποτα, εσθιε. What he renders εσθιε, was undoubtedly Ἑστιε, Hestie, the name of the God
of fire. The address was, Ω Πυρ, δεσποτα, Ἑστιε: O mighty Lord of fire, Hestius: which is changed to O Fire, come, and feed.
The island Cyprus was of old called [703]Cerastis, and Cerastia; and had a city of the same name. This city was more known by the name of Amathus: and mention is made of cruel rites practised
in its [704]temple. As long as the former name prevailed, the inhabitants were styled Cerastæ. They were more particularly the priests who were so denominated; and who were at last extirpated for their cruelty. The poets imagining that the term Cerastæ related to a horn, fabled that they were turned into bulls.
[705] Atque illos gemino quondam quibus aspera cornu Frons erat, unde etiam nomen traxere Cerastæ.
There was a city of the same name in Eubœa, expressed Carystus, where the stone [706]Asbestus was found. Of this they made a kind of cloth, which was supposed to be proof against fire, and to be cleansed by that element. The purport of the name is plain; and the natural history of the place affords us a reason why it was imposed. For this we are obliged to Solinus, who calls the city with
the Grecian termination, Carystos; and says, that it was noted for its hot streams: [707]Carystos aquas calentes habet, quas Ελλοπιας vocant. We may therefore be assured, that it was called Carystus from the Deity of fire, to whom all hot fountains were sacred. Ellopia is a compound of El Ope, Sol Python, another name of the same Deity. Carystus, Cerastis, Cerasta, are all of the same purport: they betoken a place, or temple of Astus, or Asta, the God of fire. Cerasta in the feminine is expressly the same, only reversed, as Astachar in Chusistan. Some places had the same term in the composition of their names, which was joined with Kur; and they were named in honour of the Sun, styled Κυρος, Curos. He was worshipped all over Syria; and one large province was hence
named Curesta, and Curestica, from Κυρ Ἑστος, Sol Hestius.
In Cappadocia were many Puratheia; and the people followed the same manner of worship, as was practised in Persis. The rites which prevailed, may be inferred from the names of places, as well as from the history of the country. One city seems to have been denominated from its tutelary Deity, and called Castabala. This is a plain compound of Ca-Asta-Bala, the place or temple of Asta Bala; the same Deity, as by the Syrians was called Baaltis. Asta Bala was the Goddess of



fire: and the same customs prevailed here as at Feronia in Latium. The female attendants in the
temple used to walk with their feet bare over burning [708]coals.
Such is the nature of the temple named Istachar; and of the caverns in the mountains of Chusistan. They were sacred to Mithras, and were made use of for his rites. Some make a distinction between
Mithras, Mithres, and Mithra: but they were all the same Deity, the [709]Sun, esteemed the chief God of the Persians. In these gloomy recesses people who were to be initiated, were confined for a long season in the dark, and totally secluded from all company. During this appointed term they
underwent, as some say, eighty kinds of trials, or tortures, by way of expiation. [710]Mithra apud Persas Sol esse existimatur: nemo vero ejus sacris initiari potest, nisi per aliquot suppliciarum gradus transierit. Sunt tormentorum ij lxxx gradus, partim intensiores.—Ita demum, exhaustis
omnibus tormentis, sacris imbuuntur. Many [711]died in the trial: and those who survived were often so crazed and shaken in their intellects, that they never returned to their former state of mind.
Some traces of this kind of penance may be still perceived in the east, where the followers of Mahomet have been found to adopt it. In the history given by Hanway of the Persian monarch, Mir Maghmud, we have an account of a process similar to that above, which this prince thought proper to undergo. He was of a sour and cruel disposition, and had been greatly dejected in his
spirits; on which account he wanted to obtain some light and assistance from heaven. [712]With this intent Maghmud undertook to perform the spiritual exercises which the Indian Mahommedans, who are more addicted to them than those of other countries, have introduced into Kandahar. This superstitious practice is observed by shutting themselves up fourteen or fifteen days in a place where no light enters. The only nourishment they take is a little bread and water at sun-set. During this retreat they employ their time in repeating incessantly, with a strong guttural voice, the word Hou, by which they denote one of the attributes of the Deity. These continual cries, and the agitations of the body with which they were attended, naturally unhinge the whole frame. When by fasting and darkness the brain is distempered, they fancy they see spectres and hear voices. Thus they take pains to confirm the distemper which puts them upon such trials.
Such was the painful exercise which Maghmud undertook in January this year; and for this purpose he chose a subterraneous vault. In the beginning of the next month, when he came forth, he was so pale, disfigured, and emaciated, that they hardly knew him. But this was not the worst effect of his devotion. Solitude, often dangerous to a melancholy turn of thought, had, under the circumstances of his inquietude, and the strangeness of his penance, impaired his reason. He became restless and suspicious, often starting.—In one of these fits he determined to put to death the whole family of his predecessor, Sha Hussein; among whom were several brothers, three uncles, and seven nephews, besides that prince's children. All these, in number above an hundred, the tyrant cut to pieces with his own hand in the palace yard, where they were assembled for that bloody purpose. Two small children only escaped by the intervention of their father, who was wounded in endeavouring to screen them.



Pl. III. Petra, Mithra or Temple of Mithras from Thevenot. Part 2.
The reverence paid to caves and grottos arose from a notion that they were a representation of the
[713]world; and that the chief Deity whom the Persians worshipped proceeded from a cave. Such was the tradition which they had received, and which contained in it matter of importance. Porphyry attributes the original of the custom to Zoroaster, whoever Zoroaster may have been; and says, that he first consecrated a natural cavern in Persis to Mithras, the creator and father of all things. He was followed in this practice by others, who dedicated to the Deity places of this
[714]nature; either such as were originally hollowed by nature, or made so by the art of man. Those, of which we have specimens exhibited by the writers above, were probably enriched and ornamented by the Achaimenidæ of Persis, who succeeded to the throne of Cyrus. They are modern, if compared with the first introduction of the worship; yet of high antiquity in respect to us. They are noble relics of Persic architecture, and afford us matter of great curiosity.
OF THE
OMPHI,
AND OF
THE WORSHIP UPON HIGH PLACES.
The term Omphi is of great antiquity, and denotes an oracular influence, by which people obtained an insight into the secrets of futurity. I have taken notice with what reverence men in the first ages repaired to rocks and caverns, as to places of particular sanctity. Here they thought that the Deity



would most likely disclose himself either by a voice, or a dream, or some other præternatural token. Many, for the same purpose, worshipped upon hills, and on the tops of high mountains; imagining that they hereby obtained a nearer communication with heaven. Hence we read, as far
back as the days of Moses, concerning the high places in [715]Canaan. And, under the kings of Israel and Judah, that the people made their offerings in high places. We are particularly told of
Pekah, the son of Remaliah, that he walked in the way of the [716] kings of Israel; yea, and made his sons to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen—and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. And many times when a reformation was introduced under some of the wiser and better princes, it is still
lamented by the sacred writer, that [717] the high places were not taken away: the people still offered, and burnt incense on the high places. It is observable, when the king of Moab wanted to
obtain an answer from God, that he took Balaam the prophet, and brought him to the [718]high places of Baal. And, finding that he could not obtain his purpose there, he carried him into the field of Zophim unto the top of Pisgah; and from thence he again removed him to the top of Peor.
In all these places he erected seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every[719] altar. It is said of Orpheus, that he went with some of his disciples to meet Theiodamas, the son of Priam,
and to partake in a sacrifice which he every year offered upon the summit of a high[720] mountain.
We are told by Strabo, that the Persians always performed their worship upon hills[721]. Περσαι τοινυν αγαλματα και βωμους ουχ ἱδρυονται· Θυουσι δε εν ὑψηλῳ τοπῳ, τον ουρανον ηγουμενοι Δια.
The people of Cappadocia and Pontus observed the like method of worship: and, of all sacrifices, wherever exhibited upon high places, none, perhaps, ever equalled in magnificence that which was offered by Mithridates upon his war with the Romans. He followed the Persic modes of worship, as well as the mixed rites of the Chaldeans and Syrians. Hence he chose one of the highest mountains in his dominions: upon the top of which he reared an immense pile, equal in
size to the summit on which it stood: and there he sacrificed to the God of armies—[722]Εθυε τῳ
Στρατιῳ Διι πατριον θυσιαν, επι ορους ὑψηλου κορυφην μειζονα αλλην επιτιθεις. The pile was raised by his vassal princes: and the offerings, besides those customary, were wine, honey, oil, and every species of aromatics. The fire is said to have been perceived at the distance of near a thousand stadia. The Roman poet makes his hero choose a like situation for a temple which he erected to Venus; and for the grove which he dedicated to the manes of his father.
[723]Tum vicina astris Ericino in vertice sedes Fundatur Veneri Idaliæ: tumuloque Sacerdos, Et lucus, late sacer, additur Anchiseo.
In Japan most of their temples at this day are constructed upon eminences; and often upon the
ascent of high mountains. They are all, [724]says Kæmpfer, most sweetly seated: A curious view of the adjacent country, a spring and rivulet of clear water, and the neighbourhood of a grove with pleasant walks, being the necessary qualifications of those spots of ground where these holy structures are to be built: for they say that the Gods are extremely delighted with such high and pleasant places.
This practice in early times was almost universal; and every [725]mountain was esteemed holy. The people, who prosecuted this method of worship, enjoyed a soothing infatuation, which flattered the gloom of superstition. The eminences to which they retired were lonely, and silent; and seemed to be happily circumstanced for contemplation and prayer. They, who frequented them, were raised above the lower world; and fancied that they were brought into the vicinity of the powers of the air, and of the Deity who resided in the higher regions. But the chief excellence for which they were frequented, was the Omphi, expressed ομφη by the Greeks, and interpreted
[726]Θεια κληδων, vox divina, being esteemed a particular revelation from heaven. In short, they were looked upon as the peculiar places where God delivered his oracles. Hermæus in Plutarch expresses this term ομφις, omphis; and says, that it was the name of an Egyptian Deity: and he
interprets it, I know not for what reason, [727]ευεργετης. The word truly rendered was Omphi or Amphi, the oracle of Ham; who, according to the Egyptian theology, was the same as the Sun, or Osiris. He was likewise revered as the chief Deity by the Chaldeans; and by most nations in the east. He was styled both Ham, and Cham: and his oracles both Omphi and Ompi. In consequence of this, the mountains where they were supposed to be delivered, came to be denominated Har-alOmpi; which al-ompi by the Greeks was changed to Ολυμπος, Olympus; and the mountain was



called ορος Ολυμπου. There were many of this name. The Scholiast upon Apollonius reckons
up [728]six: but there were certainly more, besides a variety of places styled upon the same
account [729]Olympian. They were all looked upon to be prophetic; and supposed to be the residence of the chief Deity, under whatever denomination he was specified, which was generally the God of light. For these oracles no place was of more repute than the hill at Delphi, called Omphi-El, or the oracle of the Sun. But the Greeks, who changed Al-omphi to Olympus, perverted these terms in a manner still more strange: for finding them somewhat similar in sound to a word in their own language, their caprice immediately led them to think of ομφαλος, a navel, which they substituted for the original word. This they did uniformly in all parts of the world; and always invented some story to countenance their mistake. Hence, whenever we meet with an idle account of a navel, we may be pretty sure that there is some allusion to an oracle. In respect to Delphi, they presumed that it was the umbilicus, or centre of the whole earth. The poets
gave into this notion without any difficulty; Sophocles calls it [730]μεσομφαλα Γης μαντεια: and Euripides avers that it was the precise centre of the earth:
[731]Οντως μεσον ομφαλον γας Φοιβου κατεχει δομος.
Livy, the historian, does not scruple to accede to this notion, and to call it [732]umbilicum orbis
terrarum. Strabo speaks of it in this light, but with some hesitation. [733]Της Ἑλλαδος εν μεσῳ ΠΩΣ εστι της συμπασης—ΕΝΟΜΙΣΘΗ δη και οικουμενης· και εκαλεσαν της γης
ΟΜΦΑΛΟΝ. Varro very sensibly refutes this idle notion in some [734]strictures upon a passage in the poet Manilius to the purpose above.
O, sancte Apollo, Qui umbilicum certum terrarum obtines.
Upon which he makes this remark: Umbilicum dictum aiunt ab umbilico nostro, quod is medius locus sit terrarum, ut umbilicus in nobis: quod utrumque est falsum. Neque hic locus terrarum est medius; neque noster umbilicus est hominis medius. Epimenides long before had said the same:
[735]Ουτε γαρ ην γαιης μεσος ομφαλος, ουδε θαλασσης.
But supposing that this name and character had some relation to Delphi, how are we to account for other places being called after this manner? They could not all be umbilical: the earth cannot be supposed to have different centres: nor could the places thus named be always so situated, as to be central in respect to the nation, or the province in which they were included. Writers try to make it out this way: yet they do not seem satisfied with the process. The contradictory accounts shew the absurdity of the notion. It was a term borrowed from Egypt, which was itself an Omphalian region. Horus Apollo not knowing the meaning of this has made Egypt the centre of
the earth: [736]Αιγυπτων γη μεση της οικουμενης. Pausanias mentions an Omphalus in the Peloponnesus, which was said to have been the middle of that country. He seems however to
doubt of this circumstance, as he well may[737]. Ου πορρω δε εστιν ὁ καλουμενος
Ομφαλος, Πελοποννησου δε πασης μεσον, ει δη τα οντα ειρηκασι. At no great distance is a place called the Omphalus, or navel; which is the centre of the whole Peloponnesus, if the
people here tell us the truth. At Enna in [738]Sicily was an Omphalus: and the island of Calypso is
represented by Homer as the umbilicus of the sea. The Goddess resided—[739]Νησῳ εν
αμφιρυτῃ ὁθι τ' ομφαλος εστι θαλασσης. The Ætolians were styled umbilical; and looked upon themselves as the central people in Greece, like those of Delphi. But this notion was void of all truth in every instance which has been produced: and arose from a wrong interpretation of antient terms. What the Grecians styled Omphalus was certainly Ompha-El, the same as AlOmpha; and related to the oracle of Ham or the Sun: and these temples were Prutaneia, and Puratheia, with a tumulus or high altar, where the rites of fire were in antient times performed. As a proof of this etymology most of the places styled Olympian, or Omphalian, will be found to have a reference to an oracle. Epirus was celebrated for the oracle at Dodona: and we learn from the antient poet, Reianus, that the natives were of old called Omphalians:
[740]Συν τε Παραυαιοι, και αμυμονες Ομφαλιηεις.



There was an Omphalia in Elis; and here too was an oracle mentioned by [741]Pindar and Strabo: [742]Την δε επιφανειαν εσχεν (ἡ Ολυμπια) εξ αρχης δια το μαντειον του Ολυμπιου Διος. The place derived all its lustre originally from the oracular temple of Olympian Jove. In this
province was an antient city [743]Alphira; and a grove of Artemis [744]Alpheionia, and the whole was watered by the sacred river Alpheus. All these are derived from El, the prophetic Deity, the Sun; and more immediately from his oracle, Alphi. The Greeks deduced every place from some
personage: and Plutarch accordingly makes Alpheus[745]—Ἑις των το γενος αφ' ἡλιου
καταγοντων, one of those who derived their race from the Sun. The term Alphi, from whence the Greeks formed Alphira, Alpheionia, and Alpheüs, is in acceptation the same as Amphi. For Ham being by his posterity esteemed the Sun, or El; and likewise Or, the same as Orus; his oracles were in consequence styled not only Amphi, and Omphi, but Alphi, Elphi, Orphi, Urphi.
I have taken notice of several cities called Omphalian, and have observed, that they generally had oracular temples: but by the Greeks they were universally supposed to have been denominated
from a navel. There was a place called [746]Omphalian in Thessaly: and another in Crete, which
had a celebrated [747]oracle. It is probably the same that is mentioned by Strabo, as being upon mount Ida, where was the city Elorus. Diodorus speaks of this oracle, named Omphalian; but supposes that the true name was ομφαλος, omphalus: and says, that it was so called (strange to tell) because Jupiter, when he was a child, lost his navel here, which dropped into the river Triton:
[748]Απο τουτου τοτε συμβαντος Ομφαλον προσαγορευθηναι το χωριον: from this accident the place had the name of Omphalus, or the navel. Callimachus in his hymn to Jupiter dwells upon this circumstance:
[749]Ευτε Θενας απελειπεν επι Κνωσσοιο φερουση, Ζευ πατερ, ἡ Νυμφη σε (Θεναι δ' εσαν εγγυθι Κνωσσου) Τουτακι τοι πεσε, Δαιμον, απ' ομφαλος, ενθεν εκεινο Ομφαλιον μετεπειτα πεδον καλεουσι Κυδωνες.
Who would imagine, that one of the wisest nations that ever existed could rest satisfied with such idle figments: and how can we account for these illusions, which overspread the brightest minds? We see knowing and experienced people inventing the most childish tales; lovers of science adopting them; and they are finally recorded by the grave historian: all which would not appear credible, had we not these evidences so immediately transmitted from them. And it is to be observed that this blindness is only in regard to their religion; and to their mythology, which was grounded thereupon. In all other respects they were the wisest of the sons of men.
We meet in history with other places styled Omphalian. The temple of Jupiter Ammon was esteemed of the highest antiquity, and we are informed that there was an omphalus here; and that the Deity was worshipped under the form of a navel. Quintus Curtius, who copied his history from the Greeks, gives us in the life of Alexander the following strange account, which he has
embellished with some colouring of his own. [750]Id, quod pro Deo colitur, non eandem effigiem habebat, quam vulgo Diis Artifices accommodârunt. Umbilico maxime similis est habitus, smaragdo, et gemmis, coagmentatus. Hunc, cum responsum petitur, navigio aurato gestant Sacerdotes, multis argenteis pateris ab utroque navigii latere pendentibus. The whole of this is an abuse of terms, which the author did not understand, and has totally misapplied. One would imagine that so improbable a story, as that of an umbilical Deity with his silver basons, though patched up with gold and emeralds, would have confuted itself. Yet Schottus in his notes upon Curtius has been taken with this motly description: and in opposition to all good history, thinks that this idle story of a navel relates to the compass. Hyde too has adopted this notion; and proceeds to shew how each circumstance may be made to agree with the properties of the magnet.
[751]Illa nempe Jovis effigies videtur semiglobulare quiddam, uti est compassus marinus, formâ umbilici librarii, seu umbonis, tanquam ενθεον quoddam adoratum, propter ejusdem divinum auxilium: utpote in quo index magneticus erat sicut intus existens quidam deus, navigiorum cursum in medio æquore dirigens. These learned men were endued with a ready faith: and not only acquiesce in what they have been told, but contribute largely to establish the mistake. The true history is this. Most places in which was the supposed oracle of a Deity, the Grecians, as I have before mentioned, styled Olympus, Olympia, and Olympiaca: or else Omphale, and Omphalia, and the province χωριον Ομφαλιον. These terms were thought to relate to a navel: but, if such an interpretation could have been made to correspond with the history of any one place, yet that history could not have been reiterated; nor could places so widely distant have all



had the same reference. What was terminated ομφαλος was [752]Omph-El, the oracle of God, the seat of divine influence: and Al-Omphi was a name given to mountains and eminences upon the same account. An oracle was given to Pelias in Thessaly: and whence did it proceed? from the well wooded omphalus of his mother Earth.
[753]Ηλθε δε ὁι κρυοεν Πυκινῳ μαντευμα θυμῳ Παρα μεσον ομφαλον Ευδενδροιο ῥηθεν ματερος.
In other words, it proceeded from the stately grove of Hestia, where stood an oracular temple.
In respect to the omphalus of Ammon, which Curtius has translated umbilicus, and garnished with gold and jewels, the whole arises from a mistake in terms, as in the many instances before. It was Omphi El, the oracle of Ham, or the Sun: and the shrine, from whence it was supposed to proceed, was carried in a boat. The Pateræ, represented as so many silver basons, were in reality the interpreters of the oracle. They were the priests, who in the sacred processions walked on each side, and supported both the image and the boat in which it was carried. They are said to have been eighty in number; and they pretended to bear the Deity about, just as they were by the divine
impulse directed. The God, says [754]Diodorus Siculus, is carried about in a ship of gold by eighty of his priests. They bear him upon their shoulders, and pursue their way by instinct, just as the divine automaton chances to direct them. These persons, who thus officiated, were probably the same as the Petipharæ of the antient Egyptians, but were called Pateræ by the Greeks. It was a name, and office, by which the priests of Delphi, and of many other places besides those in Egypt, were distinguished: and the term always related to oracular interpretation. Hence Bochart
describes these priests, and their function, very justly. [755]Pateræ Sacerdotes Apollinis, oraculorum interpretes. Pator, or Petor, was an Egyptian word; and Moses speaking of Joseph, and the dreams of Pharaoh, more than once makes use of it in the sense above. It occurs Genesis. c. 41. v. 8.—v. 13. and manifestly alludes to an interpretation of that divine intercourse, which the Egyptians styled Omphi. This was communicated to Pharaoh by a dream: for the Omphi was
esteemed not only a verbal response, but also an intimation by [756]dreams—Ομφη, φημη θεια,
θεια κληδων—ονειρου φαντασματα. Hesychius. So it likewise occurs in Eusebius; who quotes a passage from the oracles of Hecate, wherein the Gods are represented, as insensibly wafted through the air like an Omphean vision.
[757]Τους δε μεσους μεσατοισιν επεμβεβαωτας αηταις Νοσφι πυρος θειοιο ΠΑΝΟΜΦΕΑΣ ηυτ' ΟΝΕΙΡΟΥΣ.
These Omphean visions were explained by Joseph; he interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh: wherefore the title of Pator is reckoned by the Rabbins among the names of Joseph. There is thought to be the same allusion to divine interpretation in the name of the apostle Peter: Πετρος,
ὁ επιλυων, ὁ επιγινωσκων. Hesych. Petrus Hebræo sermone agnoscens notat. Arator. From these examples we may, I think, learn that the priest was styled Petor, and Pator: and that it was the place, which properly was called Patora. The Colossal statue of Memnon in the Thebaïs was a Patora, or oracular image. There are many inscriptions upon different parts of it; which were
copied by Dr. Pocock[758], and are to be seen in the first volume of his travels. They are all of late date in comparison of the statue itself; the antiquity of which is very great. One of these inscriptions is particular, and relates to the Omphi, which seems to have frightened away some illdisposed people in an attempt to deface the image:
[759]Εικονα λωβητηρες ελυμηναντ' ὁτι διαν Θειοτατου νυκτωρ ομφην επι Μεμνονος ηλθον.
One of the most famous oracles of Apollo was in Lycia: and in consequence of it the place was named Patara. Patra in Achaia was of the same purport. I should imagine, that the place where
Balaam the false [760]prophet resided, was of the same nature; and that by Pethor and Pethora was meant a place of interpretation, or oracular temple. There was probably a college of priests; such as are mentioned to have existed among the Amonians: of whom Balaam had been by the king of Moab appointed chief Petora, or priest. It seems to have been the celebrated place in Arabia,
famous in after times for the worship of Alilat, and called by the Romans [761]Petra.



The custom of carrying the Deity in a shrine, placed in a boat, and supported by priests, was in use
among the Egyptians, as well as the [762]Ammonites. It is a circumstance which deserves our notice; as it appears to be very antient, and had doubtless a mysterious allusion. We have three
curious examples of it among [763]Bishop Pocock's valuable specimens of antiquity, which he
collected in those parts. He met with them at Luxorein, or [764]Lucorein, near Carnac, in the Thebaïs; but mentions not what they relate to: nor do I know of any writer who has attended to their history. The accounts given above by Curtius, and Diodorus, are wonderfully illustrated by these representations from Egypt. It is plain that they all relate to the same religious ceremony, and very happily concur to explain each other. It may be worth observing, that the originals whence these copies were taken are of the highest antiquity; and, probably, the most early specimens of sculpture in the world. Diodorus mentions that the shrine of Ammon had eighty persons to attend it: but Dr. Pocock, when he took these copies, had not time to be precisely accurate in this article. In his specimens the greatest number of attendants are twenty: eighteen support the boat, and one precedes with a kind of sceptre; another brings up the rear, having in his hand a rod, or staff, which had undoubtedly a mystic allusion. The whole seems to have been emblematical; and it will be hereafter shewn, that it related to a great preservation, which was most religiously recorded, and became the principal subject of all their mysteries. The person in the shrine was their chief ancestor, and the whole process was a memorial of the deluge; the history of which must have been pretty recent when these works were executed in Egypt.

From the shrines of Amon abovementioned we may derive the history of all oracles; which, from the Deity by whom they were supposed to be uttered, were called Omphi and Amphi, as I have shewn: also, Alphi, Elphi, Orphi, Urphi, from El, and Orus. The Greeks adhered religiously to antient terms, however obsolete and unintelligible. They retained the name of Amphi, though they knew not the meaning: for it was antiquated before they had letters. That it originally related to



oracular revelation is plain from its being always found annexed to the names of places famous on that account; and from its occurring in the names of men, renowned as priests and augurs, and supposed to have been gifted with a degree of foreknowledge. We read of Amphiaraus, Amphilocus, Amphimachus, persons represented as under particular divine influence, and interpreters of the will of the Gods. Amphion, though degraded to a harper, was Amphi-On, the oracle of Apollo, the Sun: and there was a temple, one of the antient ὑπαιθρα, dedicated to him
and Zethus, as we may read in Pausanias. Mopsus, the diviner, is styled Αμπυκιδης, Ampucides; which is not a patronymic, but a title of the oracular Deity.
[765]Ενθα και Αμπυκιδην αυτῳ ενι ηματι Μοψον Νηλειης ἑλε ποτμος· αδευκεα δ' ου φυγεν αισαν Μαντοσυναις· ου γαρ τις αποτροπιη θανατοιο.
Idmon, the reputed son of Abas, was a prophet, as well as Mopsus: he was favoured with the divine Omphe, and, like the former, styled Ampucides.
[766]Ενθα μεν αισα παρεσχε καταφθισθαι δυο φωτας, Αμπυκιδην Ιδμωνα, κυβερνητηρα τε Τιφυν.
What his attainments were, the Poet mentions in another place.
[767]Δε τοτ' Αβαντος παις νοθος ηλυθε καρτερος Ιδμων, Τον ῥ' υποκυσσαμενη τεκεν Απολλωνι ανακτι Αμβροσιον παρα κυμα φερετριος Αντιανειρα, Τῳ και ΜΑΝΤΟΣYΝΗΝ επορε, και θεσφατον ΟΜΦΗΝ.
To say the truth, these supposed prophets were Deities, to whom temples were consecrated under these names; or, to speak more properly, they were all titles, which related to one God, the Sun. That they were reputed Deities, is plain, from many accounts. Dion Cassius speaks of Αμφιλοχου χρηστηριον: and the three principal oracles mentioned by Justin Martyr are
[768]μαντεια—Αμφιλοχου Δωδωνης, και Πυθους. We have a similar account from Clemens
Alexandrinus. [769]Διηγησαι ἡμιν και της αλλης μαντικης, μαλλον δε μανικης, τα αχρηστα χρηστηρια, τον Κλαριον, τον Πυθιον, τον Αμφιαρεω, τον Αμφιλοχον. The Amphictuons were originally prophetic personages, who attended at the temple at Delphi. Hesychius observes: Αμφικτυονες—περιοικοι Δελφων, πυλαγοραι, ιερομνημονες.
Minerva, heavenly wisdom, is by Lycophron styled [770]Amphira; which is a compound of Amphi-Ur, the divine influence, or oracle of Orus. Of this name there was a city near Olympia in Elis: for many places were in this manner denominated, on account of their being esteemed the
seat of prophecy. In Phocis was the city Hyampolis: and close to it [771] Amphissa, famous for the oracle of an unknown Goddess, the daughter of Macaria. Amphrysus, in Bœotia, was much famed
for the influence of [772] Apollo; and Amphimallus, in Crete, was well known for its [773] oracle.
Amphiclea, in [774] Phocis, had Dionusus for its guardian Deity, whose orgies were there celebrated; and whose shrine was oracular.
I imagine that this sacred influence, under the name of Amphi, is often alluded to in the exordia of Poets, especially by the writers in Dithyrambic measure, when they address Apollo. Taken in its usual sense (αμφι circum) the word has no meaning: and there is otherwise no accounting for its being chosen above all others in the language to begin hymns of praise to this Deity, who was the principal God of prophecy. We have one instance of it in the Nubes of Aristophanes:
[775]Αμφι μοι αυτε αναξ, Δηλιε, Κυνθιαν εχων Ὑψικερατα πετραν.
Periander is mentioned as beginning a hymn with a like exordium: Αμφι μοι αυθις ανακτα:
And Terpander has nearly the same words: [776]Αμφι μοι αυθις ανακθ' ἑκατηβολον. Apollo
was so frequently called Αμφι αναξ, that it was in a manner looked upon as a necessary
proœemium. Suidas observes, Αμφιανακτιζειν το προοιμιαζειν: And Hesychius,



Αμφιανακτα, αρχη νομου Κιθαρωδικου. Much the same is told us in the Scholia upon the
passage above from Aristophanes: [777]Μιμειται δε (Αριστοφανης) τον Διθυραμβων τα προοιμια· συνεχως γαρ χρωνται ταυτῃ λεξει· διο αμφιανακτας αυτους καλουσι. However, none of these writers inform us why this word was so particularly used; nor tell us what was its purport. In the short hymns ascribed to Homer this term is industriously retained; and the persons who composed them have endeavoured to make sense of it, by adopting it according to the common acceptation.
Αμφι μοι Ερμειαο φιλον γονον εννεπε, Μουσα. Αμφι Διοσκουρων ἑλικωπιδες εσπετε, Μουσαι. Αμφι Διωνυσου Σεμελης ερικυδεος ὑιον [778]Μνησομαι.
These hymns were of late date, long after Homer; and were introduced in Ionia, and also in Cyprus and Phenicia, when the Grecians were in possession of those parts. They were used in the room of the antient hymns, which were not understood by the new inhabitants. One of them is confessedly addressed to the Goddess called Venus Ourania, in Cyprus; and was designed to be sung by the priest of that Goddess upon the stated festivals at Salamis.
[779] Χαιρε, Θεα, Σαλαμινος εϋκτιμενης μεδεουσα, Και πασης Κυπρου· δος δ' ἱμεροεσσαν αοιδην, Αυταρ εγω κεν σειο και αλλης μνησομ' αοιδης.
We may perceive, from what has been said, that the word Amphi was a term of long standing, the sense of which was no longer understood: yet the sound was retained by the Greeks, and used for a customary exclamation. In respect to the more antient exordia above quoted, especially that of Terpander, I take the words to be an imitation, rather than a translation, of a hymn sung at Delphi in the antient Amonian language; the sound of which has been copied, rather than the sense, and adapted to modern terms of a different meaning. I make no doubt but that there were many antient hymns preserved in those oracular temples, which were for a long time retained, and sung, when their meaning was very imperfectly known. They were, for the most part, composed in praise of Ham, or the Sun; and were sung by the Homeridæ, and Iämidæ. They were called after his titles, Ad, Athyr, Amphi, which the Grecians expressed Dithyrambi. They were strains of joy and exultation, attended with grand processions: and from the same term, dithyrambus, was derived the θριαμβος of the Greeks, and the triumphus of the Romans. We are informed that triumphs
were first instituted by [780]Bacchus, who was no other than Chus: the history, therefore, of the term must be sought for from among the Cuseans. That it was made up of titles, is plain, from its
being said by Varro to have been a [781]name; and one that was given by the Amonians among other personages to Dionusus: for they were not in this point uniform. Diodorus takes notice that
it was a name, and conferred upon the person spoken of: [782]Θριαμβον δε αυτον
ωνομασθηναι φασι: They say, that one of the titles given to Dionusus was Thriambus. Ham, in the very antient accounts of Greece, is called Iämus, and his priests Iämidæ. His oracle, in consequence of this, was styled Iämphi, and Iämbi, which was the same term as Amphi, of which we have been treating. From the name Iambi came the measure Ιαμβος, Iambus, in which oracles
were of old delivered. Ham, among the Egyptians, was called [783]Tithrambo, which is the same name as the Ditherambus of Diodorus. There is a remarkable passage in the Scholia upon Pindar concerning Ham, under the name of Iamus, and also concerning his temple, which is represented as oracular. [784] Μαντειον ην εν Ολυμπιᾳ, ὁυ αρχηγος γεγονεν Ιαμος, τῃ δια εμπυρων μαντειᾳ, ἡ και μεχρι του νυν ὁι Ιαμιδαι χρωνται. There was in Olympia an antient temple, esteemed a famous seat of prophecy, in which Iamus is supposed to have first presided; and where the will of the Deity was made manifest by the sacred fire upon the altar: this kind of divination is still carried on by a set of priests, who are called Iamidæ. Ιαμος αρχηγος was in reality the
Deity; and his attendants were [785]Iamidæ, persons of great power and repute. Εξ ὁυ
πολυκλειτον καθ' Ἑλλανος γενος Ιαμιδων. Pindar. Iämus was immortal, and was therefore named αθανατος.
[786]Και καταφαμιξεν καλεισθαι μιν Χρονῳ συμπαντι ματηρ



Αθανατον.
From hence we may be assured, that he was of old the real Deity of the place.
I have mentioned, that in the sacred processions in early times the Deity used to be carried about in a shrine; which circumstance was always attended with shouts, and exclamations, and the whole was accompanied with a great concourse of people. The antient Greeks styled these
celebrities the procession of the [787]P'omphi, and from hence were derived the words πομπη, and pompa. These originally related to a procession of the oracle: but were afterwards made use of to describe any cavalcade or show. In the time of Herodotus the word seems in some degree to have retained its true meaning, being by him used for the oracular influence. He informs us that Amphilutus was a diviner of Acharnan; and that he came to Pisistratus with a commission from
heaven. By this he induced that prince to prosecute a scheme which he recommended. [788] Ενταυθα θειῃ πομπῃ χρεωμενος παρισταται Πεισιστρατῳ Αμφιλυτος.—Θειη πομπη is a divine revelation, or commission. Ham was the Hermes of the Egyptians, and his oracle, as I have shewn, was styled Omphi: and when particularly spoken of as the oracle, it was expressed P'omphi, and P'ompi, the πομπη of the Greeks. Hence Hermes had the name of πομπαιος, which was misinterpreted the messenger, and conductor: and the Deity was in consequence of it made the servant of the Gods, and attendant upon the dead. But πομπαιος related properly to
divine influence; and πομπη was an oracle. An ox, or cow, was by the Amonians esteemed very
sacred, and oracular: Cadmus was accordingly said to have been directed πομπῃ βοος.
[789]Ενθα και εννασθη πομπῃ βοος, ἡν ὁι Απολλων Ωπασε μαντοσυνησι προηγητειραν ὁδοιο.
Many places were from the oracle styled P'ompean: and supposed by the Romans to have been so named from Pompeius Magnus; but they were too numerous, and too remote to have been denominated from him, or any other Roman. There was indeed Pompeiæ in Campania: but even that was of too high antiquity to have received its name from Rome. We read of Pompeiæ among the Pyrenees, Pompion in Athens, Pompelon in Spain, Pompeditha in Babylonia, Pomponiana in Gaul. There were some cities in Cilicia and Cappadocia, to which that Roman gave the name of Pompeipolis: but upon, inquiry they will be found to have been Zeleian cities, which were oracular: go that the Romans only gave a turn to the name in honour of their own countryman, by whom these cities were taken.
Besides the cities styled Pompean, there were pillars named in like manner; which by many have been referred to the same person. But they could not have been built by him, nor were they erected to his memory: as I think we may learn from their history. There are two of this denomination still remaining at a great distance from each other: both which seem to have been
raised for a religious purpose. The one stands in Egypt at [790]Alexandria; the other at the extreme point of the Thracian Bosporus, where is a communication between the Propontis and the antient Euxine sea. They seem to be of great antiquity, as their basis witnesses at this day: the shaft and superstructure is of later date. The pillar at the Bosporus stands upon one of the Cyanean rocks:
and its parts, as we may judge from [791]Wheeler, betray a difference in their æra. It was repaired in the time of Augustus: and an inscription was added by the person who erected the column, and who dedicated the whole to that Emperor.
[792]DIVO. CAESARI. AUGUSTO. E.. CL... ANDIDIUS... L. F CL. ARGENTO...
We may learn from the inscription, however mutilated, that this pillar was not the work of Pompeius Magnus; nor could it at all relate to his history: for the time of its being rebuilt was but little removed from the age in which he lived. The original work must have therefore been far prior. The pillar in Egypt is doubtless the same which was built upon the ruins of a former, by Sostratus of Cnidos, before the time of Pompeius: so that the name must have been given on
another account. The inscription is preserved by [793]Strabo.
ΣΩΣΤΡΑΤΟΣ ΚΝΙΔΙΟΣ ΔΕΞΙΦΑΝΟΥΣ



ΘΕΟΙΣ ΣΩΤΗΡΣΙΝ YΠΕΡ ΤΩΝ ΠΛΩΙΖΟΜΕΝΩΝ.
The narrow streight into the Euxine sea was a passage of difficult navigation. This was the reason, that upon each side there were temples and sacred columns erected to the Deity of the country, in order to obtain his assistance. And there is room to think, that the pillars and obelisks were made use of for beacons, and that every temple was a Pharos. They seem to have been erected at the entrance of harbours; and upon eminences along the coasts in most countries. The pillars of Hercules were of this sort, and undoubtedly for the same purpose. They were not built by him; but
erected to his honour by people who worshipped him, and who were called Herculeans. [794]Εθος γαρ παλαιον ὑπηρξε το τιθεσθαι τοιουτους ορους, καθαπερ ὁι Ρηγινοι την στηλιδα εθεσαν, την επι τῳ πορθμῳ κειμενην, πυργον τι. Και ο Πελωρος λεγομενος πυργος αντικειται τῃ ταυτῃ στηλιδι. For it was a custom, says Strabo, among the antients, to erect this kind of land-marks, such as the pillar at Rhegium, near the foot of Italy: which is a kind of tower, and was raised by the people of Rhegium at the streight where the passage was to Sicily. Directly opposite stood another building of the same sort, called the tower of Pelorus. Such Pillars were by the Iberians styled Herculean, because they were sacred to Hercules; under which
title they worshipped the chief Deity. Some of these were near Gades, and Onoba[795], Κατ'
Ονοβαν της Ιβηριας: others were erected still higher, on the coast of Lusitania. This caused an
idle dispute between Eratosthenes, Dicæarchus, and [796]others, in order to determine which were the genuine pillars of Hercules: as if they were not all equally genuine; all denominated from the Deity of the country. Two of the most celebrated stood upon each side of the Mediterranean at the noted passage called fretum Gaditanum—κατα τα ακρα του πορθμου. That on the Mauritanian side was called Abyla, from Ab-El, parens Sol: the other in Iberia had the name
of[797] Calpe. This was an obelisk or tower, and a compound of Ca-Alpe, and signifies the house, or cavern of the same oracular God: for it was built near a cave; and all such recesses were esteemed to be oracular. At places of this sort mariners used to come on shore to make their offerings; and to inquire about the success of their voyage. They more especially resorted to those
towers, and pillars, which stood at the entrance of their own havens. Nobody, says [798]Arrian, will venture to quit his harbour without paying due offerings to the Gods, and invoking their favour. Helenus in Virgil charges Æneas, whatever may be the consequence, not to neglect consulting the oracle at Cuma.
[799]Hic tibi ne qua moræ fuerint dispendia tanti, Quamvis increpitent socij, et vi cursus in altum Vela vocet, possisque sinus implere secundos, Quin adeas vatem, precibusque oracula poscas.
The island Delos was particularly frequented upon this account; and the sailors seem to have undergone some severe discipline at the altar of the God, in order to obtain his favour.
[800]Αστεριη, πολυβωμε, πολυλλιτε, τις δε σε ναυτης Εμπορος Αιγαιοιο παρηλυθε νηι θεουσῃ· Ουχ' ὁυτω μεγαλοι μιν επιπνειουσιν αηται, Χρειω δ' ὁττι ταχιστον αγει πλοον, αλλα τα λαιφη Ωκεες εστειλαντο, και ου παλιν αυθις εβησαν, Πριν μεγαν η σεο βωμον ὑπο πληγησιν ἑλιξαι Ρησσομενοι—
O! ever crown'd with altars, ever blest, Lovely Asteria, in how high repute Stands thy fair temple 'mid the various tribes Who ply the Ægean. Though their business claims Dispatch immediate; though the inviting gales Ill brook the lingering mariners' delay: Soon as they reach thy soundings, down at once Drop the slack sails, and all the naval gear. The ship is moor'd: nor do the crew presume



To quit thy sacred limits, 'till they have pass'd A painful penance; with the galling whip Lash'd thrice around thine altar.
This island was greatly esteemed for its sanctity, and there used to be a wonderful concourse of people from all nations continually resorting to its temple. The priests, in consequence of it, had hymns composed in almost all languages. It is moreover said of the female attendants, that they could imitate the speech of various people; and were well versed in the histories of foreign parts, and of antient times. Homer speaks of these extraordinary qualifications as if he had been an eyewitness:
[801]
Προς δε τοδε μεγα θαυμα, ὁτου κλεος ουποτ' ολειται. Κουραι Δηλιαδες, Ἑκατηβελετεω θεραπαιναι, Ἁιτ' επει αν πρωτον μεν Απολλων' ὑμνησωσιν, Αυτις δ' αυ Λητω τε, και Αρτεμιν ιοχεαιρην, Μνησαμεναι ανδρων τε παλαιων, ηδε γυναικων, Ὑμνον αειδουσιν, θελγουσι δε φυλ' ανθρωπων. Παντων δ' ανθρωπων φωνας, και Κρομβαλιαστυν Μιμεισθαι ισασι· φαιης δε κεν αυτος ἑκαστον Φθεγγεσθαι, ὁυτω σφι καλη συναρηρεν αοιδη.
The Delian nymphs, who tend Apollo's shrine, When they begin their tuneful hymns, first praise The mighty God of day: to his they join Latona's name, and Artemis, far fam'd For her fleet arrows and unerring bow. Of heroes next, and heroines, they sing, And deeds of antient prowess. Crowds around, Of every region, every language, stand In mute applause, sooth'd with the pleasing lay. Vers'd in each art and every power of speech, The Delians mimick all who come: to them All language is familiar: you would think The natives spoke of every different clime. Such are their winning ways: so sweet their song.
The offerings made at these places used to be of various kinds, but particularly of liba, or cakes, which were generally denominated from the temple where they were presented. A curious inscription to this purpose has been preserved by Spon and Wheeler, which belonged to some obelisk or temple upon the Thracian Bosporus. It was found on the Asiatic side, nearly opposite to the Pompean pillar, of which I before took notice. The Deity to whom it was inscribed was the same as that above, but called by another title, Aur, and Our, אור ; rendered by the Greeks [802]
Ουριος; and changed in acceptation so as to refer to another element.
[803]
Ουριον εκ πρυμνης τις ὁδηγητηρα καλειτω Ζηνα, κατα προτανων ἱστιον εκπετασας. Ειτ' επι Κυανεας δινας δρομος, ενθα Ποσειδων Καμπυλον ἑιλισσει κυμα παρα ψαμαθοις, Ειτε κατ Αιγαιου ποντου πλακα, νοστον ερευνων Νεισθω, τῳ δε Βαλων ψαιστα παρα ξοανῳ.

Great Urian Jove invoke to be your guide: Then spread the sail, and boldly stem the tide. Whether the stormy inlet you explore, Where the surge laves the bleak Cyanean shore, Or down the Egean homeward bend your way, Still as you pass the wonted tribute pay, An humble cake of meal: for Philo here,



Antipater's good son, this shrine did rear, A pleasing omen, as you ply the sail, And sure prognostic of a prosperous gale.
The Iapygian promontory had a temple to the same God, whose name by Dionysius is rendered Ὑριος.
[804]Ψυλατ' Ιηπυγιων τατανυσμενα, μεσφ' Ὑριοιο Παῤῥαλιας, Ὑριου, τοθι συρεται Ἁδριας ἁλμη.
The more difficult the navigation was, the more places of sanctity were erected upon the coast. The Bosporus was esteemed a dangerous pass; and, upon that account, abounded with Cippi, and altars. These were originally mounds of earth, and sacred to the Sun: upon which account they were called Col-On, or altars of that Deity. From hence is derived the term Colona, and Κολωνη. It came at last to denote any ness or foreland; but was originally the name of a sacred hill, and of the pillar which was placed upon it. To say the truth, there was of old hardly any headland but what had its temple or altar. The Bosporus, in particular, had numbers of them by way of seamarks, as well as for sacred purposes: and there were many upon the coast of Greece. Hence Apollonius says of the Argonauts:
[805] Ηρι δε νισσομενοισιν Αθω ανετελλε κολωνη.
In another place of the Bosporus
[806] Φαινεται ηεροεν στομα Βοσπορου, ηδε κολωναι Μυσιαι.
The like occurs in the Orphic Argonauts, where Beleus is pointing out the habitation of the Centaur Chiron:
[807]Ω φιλοι, αθρειτε σκοπιης προυχοντα κολωνον, Μεσσῳ ενι πρηωνι κατασκιον, ενθα δε Χειρων Ναιει ενι σπηλυγγι, δικαιοτατος Κενταυρων.
These Colonæ were sacred to the Apollo of Greece; and, as they were sea-marks and beacons, which stood on eminences near the mouths of rivers, and at the entrances of harbours, it caused them to be called ωρια, ουρεα, and ὁρμοι. Homer gives a beautiful description of such hills and headlands, and of the sea-coast projected in a beautiful landscape beneath, when, in some ravishing poetry, he makes all these places rejoice at the birth of Apollo:
[808]Πασαι δε σκοπιαι τοι αδον, και πρωονες ακροι Ὑψηλων ορεων, ποταμοι θ' αλα δε προρεοντες, Ακταιτ' εις ἁλα κεκλιμεναι, λιμενες τε θαλασσης.
In that happy hour The lofty cliffs, that overlook the main, And the high summits of the towering hills, Shouted in triumph: down the rivers ran In pleasing murmurs to the distant deep. The shelves, the shores, the inlets of the sea, Witness'd uncommon gladness.
Apollo, from this circumstance, was often called επακτιος, or the tutelary God of the coast; and had particular offerings upon that account.
[809]Πεισματα τ' ἁψαμενοι πορσυνομεν ἱερα καλα Ζηνι Πανομφαιῳ, και επακτιῳ Απολλωνι.
It was not only upon rocks and eminences that these Cippi and Obelisks were placed by the antients: they were to be found in their temples, where for many ages a rude stock or stone served for a representation of the Deity. They were sometimes quite shapeless, but generally of a conical



figure; of which we meet with many instances. Clemens Alexandrinus takes notice of this kind of
[810]worship: and Pausanias, in describing the temple of Hercules at Hyettus in [811]Bœotia, tells us, that there was no statue in it, nor any work of art, but merely a rude stone, after the manner of the first ages. Tertullian gives a like description of Ceres and Pallas. Pallas Attica, et Ceres
[812]Phrygia—quæ sine effigie, rudi palo, et informi specie prostant. Juno of Samos was little
better than a [813]post. It sometimes happens that aged trees bear a faint likeness to the human fabric: roots, likewise, and sprays, are often so fantastic in their evolutions, as to betray a remote resemblance. The antients seem to have taken advantage of this fancied similitude, which they improved by a little art; and their first effort towards imagery was from these rude and rotten materials. Apollonius Rhodius, in his account of the Argonauts, gives a description of a monument of this sort, which was by them erected in a dark grove, upon a mountainous part of
[814]Bithynia. They raised an altar of rough stones, and placed near it an image of Rhea, which they formed from an arm or stump of an old vine.
Εσκε δε τι στιβαρον στυπος αμπελου, εντρεφον ὑλῃ Προγνυ γερανδρυον, το μεν εκταμον οφρα πελοιτο Δαιμονος ουρειης ἱερον βρετας· εξεσε δ' Αργως Ευκοσμως, και δη μιν επ' οκρυοεντι Κολωνῳ Ιδρυσαν, φηγοισιν επηρεφες ακροτατησιν· Ἁι ρα τε πασαων πανυπερταται εῤῥιζωντο Βωμον δ' αυ χεραδος παρανηνεον, αμφι δε φυλλοις Στεψαμενοι δρυινοισι θυηπολιης εμελοντο.
A dry and wither'd branch, by time impair'd, Hung from an ample and an aged vine, Low bending to the earth: the warriors axe Lopt it at once from the parental stem. This as a sacred relick was consigned To Argus' hands, an image meet to frame Of Rhea, dread Divinity, who ruled Over Bithynia's mountains. With rude art He smooth'd and fashion'd it in homely guise. Then on a high and lonely promontory Rear'd it amid a tall and stately grove Of antient beeches. Next of stones unwrought They raise an altar; and with boughs of oak Soft wreaths of foliage weave to deck it round. Then to their rites they turn, and vows perform.
The same circumstance is mentioned in the Orphic Argonautics[815]; where the poet speaks of Argus, and the vine branch:
Αμφιπλακες ερνος Αμπελου αυαλιης οξει απεκερσε σιδηρῳ, Ξεσσε δ' επισταμενως.
The Amazonians were a very antient people, who worshipped their provincial Deity under the character of a female, and by the titles of Artemis, Oupis, Hippa. They first built a temple at
Ephesus; and according to Callimachus [816]the image of the Goddess was formed of the stump of a beech tree.
Σοι και Αμαζονιδες πολεμου επιθυμητειραι Εκ κοτε παῤῥαλιῃ Εφεσου βρετας ἱδρυσαντο [817]Φηγῳ ὑπο πρεμνῳ, τελεσεν δε τοι ἱερον Ἱππω· Αυται δ', Ουπι ανασσα, περι πρυλιν ωρχησαντο.
Instead of an image made of a stump, the poet Dionysius supposes a temple to have been built beneath the trunk of a decayed tree.



Ενθα Θεῃ ποτε νηον Αμαζονιδες τετυχοντο Πρεμνῳ ὑπο πτελεης, περιωσιον ανδρασι θαυμα. v. 827.
It is observable, that the Chinese, as well as the people of Japan, still retain something of this custom. When they meet with an uncouth root, or spray of a tree, they humour the extravagance: and, by the addition of a face, give it the look of a Joss or Bonzee, just as fancy directs them.
The vine was esteemed sacred both to Dionusus, and Bacchus; for they were two different personages, though confounded by the Grecians: indeed the titles of all those, who were originally styled Baalim, are blended together. This tree had therefore the name of Ampel, which the Greeks rendered Αμπελος, from the Sun, Ham, whose peculiar plant it was. This title is the same as Omphel before mentioned, and relates to the oracular Deity of the Pagan world; under which character Ham was principally alluded to. The Egyptian and Asiatic Greeks had some imperfect traditions about Ham, and Chus: the latter of which they esteemed Bacchus. And as the term Ampelus did not primarily relate to the vine, but was a sacred name transferred from the Deity, they had some notion of this circumstance: but as it was their custom out of every title to form a new personage, they have supposed Ampelus to have been a youth of great beauty, and one whom Bacchus particularly favoured. Hence Nonnus introduces the former begging of Selene not to envy him this happiness.
[818]Μη φθονεσῃς, ὁτι Βακχος εμην φιλοτητα φυλασσει. Ὁττι νεος γενομην, ὁτι και φιλος ειμι Λυαιου.
The worship of Ham was introduced by the Amonians in Phrygia and Asia Minor: and in those parts the Poet makes Ampelus chiefly conversant.
[819]Ηδη γαρ Φρυγιης ὑπο δειραδι κουρος αθυρων Αμπελος ηεξητο νεοτρεφες ερνος ερωτων.
He speaks of his bathing in the waters, and rising with fresh beauty from the stream, like the morning star from the ocean.
[820]Πακτωλῳ πορε και συ τεον σελας, οφρα φανειη Αμπελος αντελλων, ἁτε φωσφοροςΚοσμησει σεο καλλος ὁλον Πακτωλιον ὑδωρ.
In all these instances there are allusions to a history, which will hereafter be fully discussed. Ovid seems to make Ampelus a native of Thrace; and supposes him to have been the son of a satyr by one of the nymphs in that country:
[821] Ampelon intonsum, Satyro Nymphâque creatum, Fertur in Ismariis Bacchus amâsse jugis.
But however they may have mistaken this personage, it is certain that in early times he was well known, and highly reverenced. Hence wherever the Amonians settled, the name of Ampelus will occur: and many places will be found to have been denominated from the worship of the Deity
under this sacred title. We learn from Stephanus Byzantinus, [822]that, according to Hecatæus, in his Europa, Ampelus was the name of a city in Liguria. There was likewise a promontory in the district of Torone called Ampelus: a like promontory in Samos: another in Cyrene. Agrœtas mentions two cities there, an upper, and a lower, of that name. There was likewise a harbour in
Italy so called. We read of a city [823]Ampeloëssa in Syria, and a nation in Lybia called Ampeliotæ: Αμπελιωται δε εθνος Λιβυης. Suidas. Also, Ampelona in Arabia; and a promontory, Ampelusia, near Tingis, in Mauritania. In all these places, however distant, the Amonians had made settlements. Over against the island Samos stood the sacred promontory, Mycale, in Ionia. This, too, was called Ampelus, according to Hesychius, as the passage is happily altered by Albertus and others. Αμπελος, μηχανη, και ακρα Μυκαλης, ηγουν ορους. From the words ηγουν ορους one might infer, that Ampelus was no uncommon name for a mountain in general: so far is certain, that many such were so denominated: which name could not relate to
αμπελος, the vine; but they were so called from the Deity to whom they were [824]sacred. Many
of these places were barren crags, and rocks of the sea, ill suited to the cultivation of the [825]vine. And not only eminences were so called, but the strand and shores, also, for the same reason:



because here, too, were altars and pillars to this God. Hence we read in Hesychius: Αμπελος
αιγιαλος—Κυρηναιοις αιγιαλος. By Ampelus is signified the sea shore; or Ampelus, among the people of Cyrene, signifies the sea shore.
From what has been said, we may be assured that Ampelus and Omphalus were the same term originally, however varied afterwards and differently appropriated. They are each a compound from Omphe, and relate to the oracular Deity. Ampelus, at Mycale, in Ionia, was confessedly so
denominated from its being a sacred[826] place, and abounding with waters; by which, people who drank them were supposed to be inspired. They are mentioned in an antient oracle quoted by
Eusebius[827]: Εν Διδυμον γυαλοις Μυκαλησιον ΕΝΘΕΟΝ ὑδωρ. I have mentioned that all fountains were esteemed sacred, but especially those which had any præternatural quality, and abounded with exhalations. It was an universal notion that a divine energy proceeded from these effluvia, and that the persons who resided in their vicinity were gifted with a prophetic quality. Fountains of this nature, from the divine influence with which they were supposed to abound, the Amonians styled Ain Omphe, sive fontes Oraculi. These terms, which denoted the fountain of the prophetic God, the Greeks contracted to Νυμφη, a Nymph; and supposed such a person to be an inferior Goddess, who presided over waters. Hot springs were imagined to be more immediately
under the inspection of the nymphs: whence Pindar styles such fountains, [828]Θερμα Νυμφαν
λουτρα. The temple of the Nymphæ Ionides, in Arcadia, stood close to a fountain of great
[829]efficacy. The term Nympha will be found always to have a reference to [830]water. There was in the same region of the Peloponnesus a place called Νυμφας, Nymphas; which was
undoubtedly so named from its hot springs: [831]Καταῤῥειται γαρ ὑδατι—Νυμφας: for Nymphas—abounded with waters. Another name for these places was Ain-Ades, the fountain of Ades, or the Sun; which, in like manner, was changed to Ναιαδες, Naiades, a species of Deities of the same class. Fountains of bitumen, in Susiana and Babylonia, were called Ain-Aptha, the fountains of Aptha, the God of fire; which by the Greeks was rendered Naptha, a name given to
[832]bitumen. As they changed Ain Omphe to Numpha, a Goddess, they accordingly denominated the place itself Νυμφειον, Nymphæum: and wherever a place occurs of that name, there will be
found something particular in its circumstances. We are told by [833]Pliny that the river Tigris, being stopped in its course by the mountains of Taurus, loses itself under ground, and rises again on the other side at Nymphæum. According to Marcellinus, it seems to be at Nymphæum that it sinks into the earth. Be it as it may, this, he tells us, is the place where that fiery matter called
naptha issued: from whence, undoubtedly, the place had its name. [834]Bitumen nascitur prope lacum Sosingitem, cujus alveo Tigris voratus, fluensque subterraneus, procursis spatiis longis, emergit. Hic et Naptha gignitur specie piceâ. In his pagis hiatus conspicitur terræ, unde halitus lethalis exsurgens, quodcunque animal prope consistit, odore gravi consumit. There was an island of the like nature at the mouth of the river Indus, which was sacred to the Sun, and styled Cubile
[835]Nympharum: in quâ nullum non animal absumitur. In Athamania was a temple of the
Nymphs, or [836]Nymphæum; and near it a fountain of fire, which consumed things brought near to it. Hard by Apollonia was an eruption of bituminous matter, like that in Assyria: and this too
was named [837]Nymphæum. The same author (Strabo) mentions, that in Seleucia, styled Pieria, there was alike bituminous eruption, taken notice of by Posidonius; and that it was called Ampelitis: [838]Την Αμπελιτην γην ασφαλτωδη, την εν Σελευκειᾳ τη Πιεριᾳ μεταλλευομενην. The hot streams, and poisonous effluvia near Puteoli and lake Avernus are well known. It was esteemed a place of great sanctity; and people of a prophetic character are said
to have here resided. Here was a [839]Nymphæum, supposed to have been an oracular temple.
There was a method of divination at Rome, mentioned by [840]Dion Cassius, in which people formed their judgment of future events from the steam of lighted frankincense. The terms of inquiry were remarkable: for their curiosity was indulged in respect to every future contingency,
excepting death and marriage. The place of divination was here too called [841]Nymphæum. Pausanias takes notice of a cavern near Platea, which was sacred to the Nymphs of Cithæron: Ὑπερ δε της κορυφης, εφ' ᾑ τον βωμον ποιουνται, πεντε που μαλιστα και δεκα ὑποκαταβαντι σταδιους ΝYΜΦΩΝ εστιν αντρον Κιθαιρωνιδων—ΜΑΝΤΕΥΕΣΘΑΙ δε τας Νυμφας το αρχαιον αυτοθι εχει λογος. We find that the Nymphs of this place had been of old prophetic. Evagrius mentions a splendid building at Antioch called Nymphæum,
remarkable [842]Ναματων πλουτῳ, for the advantage of its waters. There was a Nymphæum at
Rome mentioned by Marcellinus. [843]Septemzodium celebrem locum, ubi Nymphæum Marcus



condidit Imperator. Here were the Thermæ Antonianæ. As from Ain Ompha came Nympha; so from Al Ompha was derived Lympha. This differed from Aqua, or common water, as being of a sacred and prophetic nature. The antients thought, that all mad persons were gifted with divination; and they were in consequence of it styled Lymphati.
From what has preceded, we may perceive that there once existed a wonderful resemblance in the rites, customs, and terms of worship, among nations widely separated. Of this, as I proceed, many instances will be continually produced. I have already mentioned that this similitude in terms, and the religious system, which was so widely propagated, were owing to one great family, who spread themselves almost universally. Their colonies went abroad under the sanction and direction of their priests; and carried with them both the rites and the records of their country. Celsus took notice of this; and thought that people payed too little attention to memorials of this nature. He mentions particularly the oracular temples at Dodona, at Delphi, at Claros, with those of the Branchidæ and Amonians: at the same time passing over many other places, from whose priests
and votaries the whole earth seemed to have been peopled[844]. Τα μεν ὑπο της Πυθιας, η Δωδωνιων, η Κλαριου, η εν Βραγχιδαις, η εν Αμμωνος, ὑπο μυριων τε αλλων θεοπροπων προειρημενα, ὑφ' ὡν επιεικως πασα γη κατῳκισθη, ταυτα μεν ουδενι λογῳ τιθενται. As colonies went abroad under the influence and direction of their tutelary
Deities; those Deities were styled Ἡγεμονες, and Αρχηγεται: and the colony was denominated from some sacred title of the God. A colony was planted at Miletus; of which the conducting
Deity was Diana. [845]Σε γαρ ποιησατο Νηλευς Ἡγεμονην. This Goddess is styled
πολυπτολις, because this office was particularly ascribed to her: and she had many places under her patronage. Jupiter accordingly tells her:
[846]Τρις δεκα τοι πτολιεθρα, και ουκ ἑνα πυργον οπασσω.
Thrice ten fair cities shall your portion be, And many a stately tower.
Apollo likewise was called Οικτιστης and Αρχηγετης, from being the supposed founder of cities; which were generally built in consequence of some oracle.
[847]Φοιβῳ δ' εσπομενοι πολεας διεμετρησαντο Ανθρωποι· Φοιβος γαρ αει πολιεσσι φιληδει Κτιζομεναις· αυτος δε θεμειλια Φοιβος ὑφαινει.
'Tis through Apollo's tutelary aid, That men go forth to regions far remote, And cities found: Apollo ever joys In founding cities.
What colony, says [848]Cicero, did Greece ever send into Ætolia, Ionia, Asia, Sicily or Italy, without having first consulted about every circumstance relative to it, either at Delphi, or Dodona,
or at the oracle of Ammon. And Lucian speaks to the same purpose. [849]Ουτε πολεας ῳκιζον,
ουδε τειχεα περιεβαλλοντο—πριν αν δη παρα Μαντεων ακουσαι ἑκαστα. People would not venture to build cities, nor even raise the walls, till they had made proper inquiry among those, who were prophetically gifted, about the success of their operations.
PATOR AND PATRA.
I cannot help thinking that the word πατηρ, pater, when used in the religious addresses of the Greeks and Romans, meant not, as is supposed, a father, or parent; but related to the divine
influence of the Deity, called, by the people of the east, Pator, as I have [850]shewn. From hence I
should infer, that two words, originally very distinct, have been rendered one and the [851]same. The word pater, in the common acceptation, might be applicable to Saturn; for he was supposed to have been the father of all the Gods, and was therefore so entitled by the antient poet Sulpitius.
[852]Jane pater, Jane tuens, Dive biceps, biformis,



O! cate rerum sator; O! principium Deorum.
But, when it became a title, which was bestowed upon Gods of every denomination, it made Jupiter animadvert with some warmth upon the impropriety, if we may credit Lucilius:
[853]Ut nemo sit nostrum, quin pater optimus Divôm est: Ut Neptunus pater, Liber, Saturnus pater, Mars, Janus, Quirinus, pater, omnes dicamur ad unum.
And not only the Gods, but the Hierophantæ, in most temples; and those priests, in particular, who were occupied in the celebration of mysteries, were styled Patres: so that it was undoubtedly a religious term imported from Egypt, the same as Pator, and Patora, before mentioned. I have taken notice, that the Pateræ of Curtius were the priests of Hamon: but that writer was unacquainted with the true meaning of the word, as well as with the pronunciation, which seems to have been penultimâ productâ. The worship of Ham, or the Sun, as it was the most antient, so it was the most universal, of any in the world. It was at first the prevailing religion of Greece, and was propagated over all the sea coast of Europe; whence it extended itself into the inland provinces. It was established in Gaul and Britain; and was the original religion of this island, which the Druids in aftertimes adopted. That it went high in the north is evident from Ausonius, who takes notice of its existing in his time. He had relations, who were priests of this order and denomination; and
who are, on that account, complimented by him, in his ode to Attius Patera [854]Rhetor.
Tu Boiocassis stirpe Druidarum satus, Si fama non fallat fidem, Beleni sacratum ducis e templo genus, Et inde vobis nomina, Tibi Pateræ: sic ministros nuncupant Apollinares Mystici. Fratri, Patrique nomen a Phæbo datum, Natoque de Delphis tuo.
He mentions, that this worship prevailed particularly in Armorica; of which country his relations were natives.
[855]Nec reticebo Senem, Nomine Phœbicium, Qui Beleni Ædituus, Stirpe satus Druidûm, Gentis Armoricæ.
Belin, the Deity of whom he speaks, was the same as [856]Bel and Balen, of Babylonia and Canaan; the Orus and Apollo of other nations. Herodian takes notice of his being worshipped by the people of Aquileia; and says, that they called him Belin, and paid great reverence, esteeming
him the same as [857]Apollo.
The true name of the Amonian priests I have shewn to have been Petor, or Pator; and the instrument which they held in their hands was styled Petaurum. They used to dance round a large fire, in honour of the Sun, whose orbit they affected to describe. At the same time they exhibited other feats of activity, to amuse the votaries who resorted to their temples. This dance was sometimes performed in armour, especially in Crete: and, being called Pyrrhic, was supposed to have been so named from Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles. But, when was he in Crete? Besides, it is said to have been practised by the Argonautic heroes before his time. It was a religious dance, denominated from fire, with which it was accompanied.
[858]Αμφι δε δαιομενοις ευρυν χορον εστησαντο, Καλον Ιηπαιηον', Ιηπαιηονα Φοιβον Μελπομενοι.
It was originally an Egyptian dance, in honour of Hermes, and practised by the Pataræ, or Priests. In some places it was esteemed a martial exercise, and exhibited by persons in armour, who gave it the name of Betarmus. We have an instance of it in the same poet:
[859]Αμυδις δε νεοι Ορφηος ανωγῃ



Εκαιροντες Βηταρμον ενοπλιον ορχησαντο, Και σακεα ξιφεεσσιν ὑπεκτυπον.
Βηταρμος Betarmus, was a name given to the dance, from the temple of the Deity where it was probably first practised. It is a compound of Bet Armes, or Armon, called, more properly, Hermes, and Hermon. Bet, and Beth, among the Amonians, denoted a temple. There is reason to think that the circular dances of the Dervises, all over the east, are remains of these antient customs. In the first ages this exercise was esteemed a religious rite, and performed by people of the temple where it was exhibited: but, in aftertimes, the same feats were imitated by rope-dancers and vagrants, called Petauristæ, and Petauristarii; who made use of a kind of pole, styled petaurum.—Of these the Roman writers make frequent mention; and their feats are alluded to by Juvenal:
[860]An magis oblectant animum jactata petauro Corpora, quique solent rectum descendere funem?
Manilius likewise gives an account of this people, and their activity; wherein may be observed some remains of the original institution:
[861]Ad numeros etiam ille ciet cognata per artem Corpora, quæ valido saliunt excussa petauro: Membraque per flammas orbesque emissa flagrantes, Delphinûmque suo per inane imitantia motu, Et viduata volant pennis, et in aëre ludunt.
I have shewn, that the Pateræ, or Priests, were so denominated from the Deity styled Pator; whose shrines were named Patera, and Petora. They were oracular temples of the Sun; which in aftertimes were called Petra, and ascribed to other Gods. Many of them for the sake of mariners were erected upon rocks, and eminences near the sea: hence the term πετρα, petra, came at length to signify any rock or stone, and to be in a manner confined to that meaning. But in the first ages it was ever taken in a religious sense; and related to the shrines of Osiris, or the Sun, and to the oracles, which were supposed to be there exhibited. Thus Olympus near Pisa, though no rock, but
a huge mound, or hill ([862]Περι γαρ τον Κρονιον ΛΟΦΟΝ αγεται τα Ολυμπια) was of old termed Petra, as relating to oracular influence. Hence Pindar, speaking of Iämus, who was supposed to have been conducted by Apollo to Olympia, says, that they both came to the Petra Elibatos upon the lofty Cronian mount: there Apollo bestowed upon Iämus a double portion of prophetic knowledge.
[863]Ἱκοντο δ' ὑψηλοιο Πετραν Αλιβατου Κρονιου, Ενθ' ὁι ωπασε θησαυρον Διδυμον ΜΑΝΤΟΣYΝΑΣ.
The word Ηλιβατος, Elibatos, was a favourite term with Homer, and other poets; and is uniformly joined with Petra. They do not seem to have known the purport of it; yet they adhere to it religiously, and introduce it wherever they have an opportunity. Ηλιβατος is an Amonian
compound of Eli-Bat, and signifies solis domus, vel [864]templum. It was the name of the temple, and specified the Deity there worshipped. In like manner the word Petra had in great measure lost its meaning; yet it is wonderful to observe how industriously it is introduced by writers, when
they speak of sacred and oracular places. Lycophron calls the temple at Elis [865]Λευραν
Μολπιδος πετραν: and the Pytho at Delphi is by Pindar styled Petraëssa: [866]Επει
Πετραεσσας ελαυνων ἱκετ' εκ Πυθωνος. Orchomenos was a place of great antiquity; and the
natives are said to have worshipped Petra, which were supposed to have fallen from [867]heaven. At Athens in the Acropolis was a sacred cavern, which was called Petræ Macræ, Petræ Cecropiæ.
[868]Ακουε τοινυν, οισθα Κεκροπιας πετρας, Προσβοῤῥον αντρον, ας Μακρας κικλησκομεν.
I have shewn that people of old made use of caverns for places of worship: hence this at Athens
had the name of Petra, or temple. [869]It is said of Ceres, that after she had wandered over the whole earth, she at last reposed herself upon a stone at Eleusis. They in like manner at Delphi



shewed the petra, upon which the Sibyl Herophile at her first arrival sat [870]down. In short, there is in history of every oracular temple some legend about a stone; some reference to the word Petra. To clear this up, it is necessary to observe, that when the worship of the Sun was almost universal, this was one name of that Deity even among the Greeks. They called him Petor, and Petros; and his temple was styled Petra. This they oftentimes changed to λιθος; so little did they understand their own mythology. There were however some writers, who mentioned it as the name of the Sun, and were not totally ignorant of its meaning. This we may learn from the Scholiast upon Pindar. [871]Περι δε του Ἡλιου ὁι φυσικοι φασιν, ὡς λιθος καλειται ὁ Ἡλιος. Και Αναξαγορου γενομενον Ευριπιδην μαθητην, Πετρον ειρηκεναι τον Ἡλιον δια των προκειμενων.
Ὁ γαρ Μακαριος, κ' ουκ ονειδιζω τυχας, Διος πεφυκως, ὡς λεγουσι, Τανταλος, Κορυφης ὑπερτελλοντα δειμαινων ΠΕΤΡΟΝ, Αερι ποτᾳται, και τινει ταυτην δικην.
The same Scholiast quotes a similar passage from the same writer, where the Sun is called Petra.
[872]Μολοιμι ταν ουρανου μεσαν Χθονος τε τεταμεναν αιωρημασι πετραν, Αλυσεσι χρυσεαις φερομεναν.
If then the name of the Sun, and of his temples, was among the antient Grecians Petros, and Petra; we may easily account for that word so often occurring in the accounts of his worship. The Scholia above will moreover lead us to discover whence the strange notion arose about the famous Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ; who is said to have prophesied, that a stone would fall from the Sun. All that he had averred, may be seen in the relation of the Scholiast above: which amounts only to this, that Petros was a name of the Sun. It was a word of Egyptian original, derived from Petor, the same as Ham, the Iämus of the antient Greeks. This Petros some of his countrymen understood in a different sense; and gave out, that he had foretold a stone would drop from the Sun. Some were idle enough to think that it was accomplished: and in consequence of it
pretended to shew at Ægospotamos the very [873]stone, which was said to have fallen. The like story was told of a stone at Abydus upon the Hellespont: and Anaxagoras was here too supposed
to have been the prophet[874]. In Abydi gymnasio ex eâ causâ colitur hodieque modicus quidem (lapis), sed quem in medio terrarum casurum Anaxagoras prædixisse narratur. The temples, or Petra here mentioned, were Omphalian, or Oracular: hence they were by a common mistake supposed to have been in the centre of the habitable globe. They were also Ηλιβατοι Πετραι;
which Elibatos the Greeks derived from βαινω descendo; and on this account the Petra were
thought to have fallen from the [875]Sun. We may by this clue unravel the mysterious story of Tantalus; and account for the punishment which he was doomed to undergo.
[876]Κορῳ δ' ἑλεν Αταν ὑπεροπλον, Ταν ὁι πατηρ ὑπερκρεμασε, Καρτερον αυτῳ λιθον Τον αει μενοινων κεφαλας βαλειν Ευφροσυνας αλαται.
The unhappy Tantalus From a satiety of bliss Underwent a cruel reverse. He was doom'd to sit under a huge stone, Which the father of the Gods Kept over his head suspended. Thus he sat In continual dread of its downfal, And lost to every comfort.



It is said of Tantalus by some, that he was set up to his chin in water, with every kind of fruit within reach: yet hungry as he was and thirsty, he could never attain to what he wanted; every
thing which he caught at eluding his efforts. But from the account given above by [877]Pindar, as
well as by [878]Alcæus, Aleman, and other writers, his punishment consisted in having a stone hanging over his head; which kept him in perpetual fear. What is styled λιθος, was I make no doubt originally Petros; which has been misinterpreted a stone. Tantalus is termed by Euripides ακολαστος την γλωσσαν, a man of an ungovernable tongue: and his history at bottom relates
to a person who revealed the mysteries in which he had been [879]initiated. The Scholiast upon Lycophron describes him in this light; and mentions him as a priest, who out of good nature
divulged some secrets of his cloister; and was upon that account ejected from the society[880]. Ο Τανταλος ευσεβης και θεοσεπτωρ ην Ἱερευς, και φιλανθρωπιᾳ τα των θεων μυστηρια τοις αμυητοις ὑστερον ειπων, εξεβληθη του ἱερου καταλογου. The mysteries which he revealed, were those of Osiris, the Sun: the Petor, and Petora of Egypt. He never afterwards could behold the Sun in its meridian, but it put him in mind of his crime: and he was afraid that the vengeance of the God would overwhelm him. This Deity, the Petor, and Petora of the Amonians, being by the later Greeks expressed Petros, and Petra, gave rise to the fable above about the stone of Tantalus. To this solution the same Scholiast upon Pindar bears witness, by
informing us, [881]that the Sun was of old called a stone: and that some writers understood the story of Tantalus in this light; intimating that it was the Sun, which hung over his head to his perpetual terror. [882]Ενιοι ακουουσι τον λιθον επι του ἡλιου—και επηωρεισθαι αυτου (Τανταλου) τον ἡλιον, ὑφ' ῳ δειματουσθαι, και καταπτησσειν. And again, Περι δε του ἡλιου ὁι φυσικοι λεγουσιν, ὡς λιθος (it should be πετρα) καλειται ὁ ἡλιος. Some understand, what is said in the history about the stone, as relating to the Sun: and they suppose that it was the Sun which hung over his head, to his terror and confusion. The naturalists, speaking of the Sun, often call him a stone, or petra.
Pl. V. Temple of Mithras Petræus in the Mountains of Persia. From Le Bruyn



By laying all these circumstances together, and comparing them, we may, I think, not only find out wherein the mistake consisted, but likewise explain the grounds from whence the mistake arose. And this clue may lead us to the detection of other fallacies, and those of greater consequence. We may hence learn the reason, why so many Deities were styled Πετραιοι,
Petræi. We read of[883] Μιθρας, ὁ θεος εκ πετρας, Mithras, the Deity out of the rock; whose temple of old was really a rock or cavern. The same worship seems to have prevailed, in some degree, in the west; as we may judge from an antient inscription at Milan, which was
dedicated[884] Herculi in Petrâ. But all Deities were not so worshipped: and the very name Petra was no other than the sacred term Petora, given to a cavern, as being esteemed in the first ages an oracular temple. And some reverence to places of this sort was kept up a long time. We may from hence understand the reason of the prohibition given to some of the early proselytes to
Christianity, that they should no more[885] ad petras vota reddere: and by the same light we may possibly explain that passage in Homer, where he speaks of persons entering into compacts under
oaks, and rocks, as places of[886] security. The oak was sacred to Zeus, and called Sar-On: and Petra in its original sense being a temple, must be looked upon as an asylum. But this term was not confined to a rock or cavern: every oracular temple was styled Petra, and Petora. Hence it proceeded that so many Gods were called Θεοι Πετραιοι, and Πατρῳσι. Pindar speaks of
Poseidon Petraios;[887] Παι Ποσειδωνος Πετραιου: under which title Neptune was worshipped by the Thessalians: but the latter was the more common title. We meet in Pausanias with Apollo Patroüs, and with [888]Ζευς Μειλιχιος, and Αρτεμις Πατρῳα; also [889]Bacchus Πατρῳος, Zeus Patroüs, and Vesta Patroa, together with other instances.
The Greeks, whenever they met with this term, even in regions the most remote, always gave it an interpretation according to their own preconceptions; and explained θεοι Πατρῳοι, the oracular Deities, by Dii Patrii, or the Gods of the country. Thus, in the Palmyrene inscription, two Syrian Deities are characterized by this title.
[890]ΑΓΛΙΒΩΛΩ ΚΑΙ ΜΑΛΑΧΒΗΛΩ ΠΑΤΡΩΟΙΣ ΘΕΟΙΣ.
Cyrus, in his expedition against the Medes, is represented as making vows [891]Ἑστιᾳ Πατρῳᾳ,
και Διι Πατρῳῳ, και τοις αλλοις Θεοις. But the Persians, from whom this history is presumed to be borrowed, could not mean by these terms Dii Patrii: for nothing could be more unnecessary than to say of a Persic prince, that the homage, which he payed, was to Persic Deities. It is a thing of course, and to be taken for granted, unless there be particular evidence to the contrary. His vows were made to Mithras, who was styled by the nations in the east Pator; his temples were Patra, and Petra, and his festivals Patrica. Nonnus gives a proper account of the Petra, when he represents it as Omphean, or oracular:
[892]Ομφαιῃ περι Πετρῃ Εισετι νηπιαχοιο χορους ἱδρυσατο Βακχου.
At Patara, in Lycia, was an oracular temple: and Patræ, in Achaia, had its name from divination,
for which it was famous. Pausanias mentions the temple, and adds, [893]Προ δε του Ἱερου της
Δημητρος εστι πηγη—μαντειον δε ενταυθα εστιν αψευδες. Before the temple is the fountain of Demeter—and in the temple an oracle, which never is known to fail.
The offerings, which people in antient times used to present to the Gods, were generally purchased at the entrance of the temple; especially every species of consecrated bread, which was denominated accordingly. If it was an oracular temple of Alphi, the loaves and cakes were styled
[894]Alphita. If it was expressed Ampi, or Ompi, the cakes were Ompai[895], Ομπαι: at the
temple of Adorus[896], Adorea. Those made in honour of Ham-orus had the name of
[897]Homoura, Amora, and Omoritæ. Those sacred to Peon, the God of light, were called
[898]Piones. At Cha-on, which signifies the house of the Sun, [899]Cauones, Χαυωνες. From Pur
Ham, and Pur-Amon, they were denominated Puramoun, [900]Πυραμουν. From Ob-El, Pytho
Deus, came [901]Obelia. If the place were a Petra or Petora, they had offerings of the same sort



called Petora, by the Greeks expressed
[902]
Πιτυρα, Pitura. One of the titles of the Sun was El
Aphas, Sol Deus ignis. This El-aphas the Greeks rendered Elaphos, ελαφος; and supposed it to relate to a deer: and the title El-Apha-Baal, given by the Amonians to the chief Deity, was changed to ελαφηβολος, a term of a quite different purport. El-aphas, and El-apha-baal, related to the God Osiris, the Deity of light: and there were sacred liba made at his temple, similar to those above, and denominated from him Ελαφοι, Elaphoi. In Athenæus we have an account of their composition, which consisted of fine meal, and a mixture of sesamum and honey. [903]
Ελαφος πλακους δια σταιτος και μελιτος και σησαμου.
One species of sacred bread, which used to be offered to the Gods, was of great antiquity, and called Boun. The Greeks, who changed the Nu final into a Sigma, expressed it in the nominative, βους; but, in the accusative, more truly boun, βουν. Hesychius speaks of the Boun, and describes
it, ειδος πεμματος κερατα εχοντος; a kind of cake, with a representation of two horns. Julius
Pollux mentions it after the same manner: βουν, ειδος πεμματος κερατα εχοντος; a sort of cake with horns. Diogenes Laertius, speaking of the same offering being made by Empedocles,
describes the chief ingredients of which it was composed:
[904]
Βουν εθυσε—εκ μελιτος και αλφιτων. He offered up one of the sacred liba, called a boun, which was made of fine flour and
honey. It is said of Cecrops,
[905]
πρωτος βουν εθυσε: He first offered up this sort of sweet bread. Hence we may judge of the antiquity of the custom from the times to which Cecrops is referred. The prophet Jeremiah takes notice of this kind of offering, when he is speaking of the Jewish women at Pathros in Egypt, and of their base idolatry; in all which their husbands had encouraged them. The women, in their expostulation upon his rebuke, tell him: Since we left off to burn incense to the Queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things; and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. And when we burnt incense to the Queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship
her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her without our
[906]
men? The prophet, in another place,
takes notice of the same idolatry.
[907]
The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the Queen of heaven. The word, in these instances, for sacred cakes, is כונים , Cunim. The Seventy translate it by a word of the same
purport, Χαυωνας, Chauonas; of which I have before taken notice:
[908]
Μη ανευ των ανδρων ἡμων εποιησαμεν αυτῃ Χαυωνας. κτλ.
I have mentioned that they were sometimes called Petora, and by the Greeks Pitura. This, probably, was the name of those liba, or cakes, which the young virgins of Babylonia and Persis, used to offer at the shrine of their God, when they were to be first prostituted: for, all, before marriage, were obliged to yield themselves up to some stranger to be deflowered. It was the custom for all the young women, when they arrived towards maturity, to sit in the avenue of the temple, with a girdle, or rope, round their middle; and whatever passenger laid hold of it was entitled to lead them away. This practice is taken notice of, as subsisting among the Babylonians, in the epistle ascribed to the prophet Jeremiah; which he is supposed to have written to Baruch. v. 43. Ἁιδε γυναικες περιθεμεναι σχοινια εν ταις ὁδοις εγκαθηνται θυμιωσαι τα ΠΙΤYΡΑ· ὁταν δε τις αυτων αφελκοθεισα ὑπο τινος των παραπορευομενων κοιμηθῃ, την πλησιον ονειδιζει, ὁτι ουκ ηξιωται, ὡσπερ αυτη, ουτε το σχοινιον αυτης διεῤῥαγη. This is a translation from an Hebrew or Chaldäic original; and, I should think, not
quite accurate. What is here rendered γυναικες, should, I imagine, be παρθενοι; and the purport will be nearly this: The virgins of Babylonia put girdles about their waist; and in this habit sit by the way side, holding their Pitura, or sacred offerings, over an urn of incense: and when any one of them is taken notice of by a stranger, and led away by her girdle to a place of privacy; upon her return she upbraids her next neighbour for not being thought worthy of the like honour;
and for having her zone not yet broken or
[909]
loosed. It was likewise a Persian custom, and seems to have been universally kept up wherever their religion prevailed. Strabo gives a particular account of this practice, as it was observed in the temple of Anait in Armenia. This was a Persian Deity, who had many places of worship in that part of the world. Not only the men and maid servants, says the author, are in this manner prostituted at the shrine of the Goddess; for in this
there would be nothing extraordinary:
[910]
Αλλα και θυγατερας ὁι επιφανεστατοι του εθνους ανιερουσι παρθενους, ἁις νομος εστι, καταπορνευθεισαις πολυν χρονον παρα τῃ Θεῳ μετα ταυτα δεδοσθαι προς γαμον· ουκ απαξιουντος τῃ τοιαυτῃ συνοικειν ουδενος. But people of the first fashion in the nation used to devote their own



daughters in the same manner: it being a religious institution, that all young virgins shall, in honour of the Deity, be prostituted, and detained for some time in her temple: after which they are permitted to be given in marriage. Nor is any body at all scrupulous about cohabiting with a young woman afterwards, though she has been in this manner abused.
The Patrica were not only rites of Mithras, but also of Osiris, who was in reality the same Deity.
We have a curious inscription to this purpose, and a representation, which was first exhibited by the learned John Price in his observations upon Apuleius. It is copied from an original, which he
saw at Venice: and there is an engraving from it in the Edition of Herodotus by [911]Gronovius, as
well as in that by [912]Wesselinge: but about the purport of it they are strangely mistaken. They suppose it to relate to a daughter of Mycerinus, the son of Cheops. She died, it seems: and her father was so affected with her death, that he made a bull of wood, which he gilt, and in it interred his daughter. Herodotus says, that he saw the bull of Mycerinus; and that it alluded to this history. But, notwithstanding the authority of this great author, we may be assured that it was an emblematical representation, and an image of the sacred bull Apis and Mneuis. And, in respect to the sculpture above mentioned, and the characters therein expressed, the whole is a religious ceremony, and relates to an event of great antiquity, which was commemorated in the rites of Osiris. Of this I shall treat hereafter: at present, it is sufficient to observe, that the sacred process is carried on before a temple; on which is a Greek inscription, but in the provincial characters: Ενδον Πατρικην Ἑορτην Φερω. How can Ἑορτη Πατρικη relate to a funeral? It denotes a festival in honour of the Sun, who was styled, as I have shewn, Pator; and his temple was called Patra: whence these rites were denominated Patrica. Plutarch alludes to this Egyptian ceremony, and supposes it to relate to Isis, and to her mourning for the loss of her son. Speaking of the month Athyr, he mentions [913]Βουν διαχρυσον ἱματιῳ μελανι βυσσινῳ περιβαλοντες επι πενθει της Θεου δεικνυουσιν (ὁι Αιγυπτιοι). The Egyptians have a custom in the month Athyr of ornamenting a golden image of a bull; which they cover with a black robe of the finest linen. This they do in commemoration of Isis, and her grief for the loss of Orus. In every figure, as they are represented in the sculpture, there appears deep silence and reverential awe: but nothing that betrays any sorrow in the agents. They may commemorate the grief of Isis; but they certainly do not allude to any misfortune of their own: nor is there any thing the least funereal in the
process. The Egyptians of all nations were the most extravagant in their [914]grief. If any died in a family of consequence, the women used by way of shewing their concern to soil their heads with the mud of the river; and to disfigure their faces with filth. In this manner they would run up and down the streets half naked, whipping themselves as they ran: and the men likewise whipped themselves. They cut off their hair upon the death of a dog; and shaved their eyebrows for a dead cat. We may therefore judge, that some very strong symptoms of grief would have been expressed, had this picture any way related to the sepulture of a king's daughter. Herodotus had his
account from different people: one half he confessedly [915]disbelieved; and the remainder was
equally incredible. For no king of Egypt, if he had made a representation of the sacred [916]bull, durst have prostituted it for a tomb: and, as I have before said, Ἑορτη Πατρικη can never relate to a funeral.
AN
ACCOUNT
OF THE
GODS OF GREECE;
To shew that they were all originally one GOD, the SUN.
As I shall have a great deal to say concerning the Grecian Theology in the course of this work, it will be necessary to take some previous notice of their Gods; both in respect to their original, and to their purport. Many learned men have been at infinite pains to class the particular Deities of different countries, and to point out which were the same. But they would have saved themselves



much labour, if, before they had bewildered themselves in these fruitless inquiries, they had considered whether all the Deities of which they treat, were not originally the same: all from one source; branched out and diversified in different parts of the world. I have mentioned that the nations of the east acknowledged originally but one Deity, the Sun: but when they came to give the titles of Orus, Osiris, and Cham, to some of the heads of their family; they too in time were looked up to as Gods, and severally worshipped as the Sun. This was practised by the Egyptians: but this nation being much addicted to refinement in their worship, made many subtile distinctions: and supposing that there were certain emanations of divinity, they affected to particularize each by some title; and to worship the Deity by his attributes. This gave rise to a multiplicity of Gods: for the more curious they were in their disquisitions, the greater was the number of these substitutes. Many of them at first were designed for mere titles: others, as I before mentioned, were αποῤῥοιαι, derivatives, and emanations: all which in time were esteemed distinct beings, and gave rise to a most inconsistent system of Polytheism. The Grecians, who received their religion from Egypt and the east, misconstrued every thing which was imported; and added to these absurdities largely. They adopted Deities, to whose pretended attributes they were totally strangers; whose names they could not articulate, or spell. They did not know how to arrange the elements, of which the words were composed. Hence it was, that Solon the Wise could not escape the bitter, but just censure of the priest in Egypt, who accused
both him, and the Grecians in general, of the grossest puerility and ignorance. [917]Ω Σολων, Σολων, Ἑλληνες εστε παιδες αει, γερων δε Ἑλλην ουκ εστι, νεοι τε ψυχας ἁπαντες· ουδεμιαν γαρ εν ἑαυτοις εχετε παλαιαν δοξαν, ουδε μαθημα χρονῳ πολιον ουδεν. The truth of this allegation may be proved both from the uncertainty, and inconsistency of the
antients in the accounts of their Deities. Of this uncertainty Herodotus takes notice. [918]Ενθενδε εγενετο ἑκαστος των θεων, ειτε δ' αει ησαν παντες, ὁκοιοι δε τινες τα ειδεα, ουκ ηπιστεατο μεχρι ὁυ πρωην τε και χθες, ὡς ειπειν λογῳ. He attributes to Homer, and to Hesiod, the various names and distinctions of the Gods, and that endless polytheism which prevailed. [919]Ουτοι δε εισι, ὁι ποιησαντες θεογονιαν Ἑλλησι, και τοισι Θεοισι τας επωνυμιας δοντες, και τιμας τε και τεχνας διελοντες, και ειδεα αυτων σημῃναντες. This blindness in regard to their own theology, and to that of the countries, whence they borrowed, led them to misapply the terms, which they had received, and to make a God out of every title. But however they may have separated, and distinguished them under different personages, they are all plainly resolvable into one Deity, the Sun. The same is to be observed in the Gods of the Romans. This may in great measure be proved from the current accounts of their own writers; if we attend a little closely to what they say: but it will appear more manifest from those who had been in Egypt, and copied their accounts from that country. There are few characters, which at first sight appear more distinct than those of Apollo and Bacchus. Yet the department, which is generally appropriated to Apollo, as the Sun, I mean the conduct of the year, is by Virgil given to Bacchus, or Liber. He joins him with Ceres, and calls them both the bright luminaries of the world.
[920]Vos, O, clarissima Mundi Lumina, labentem Cœlo qui ducitis annum, Liber, et alma Ceres.
[921]Quidam ipsum solem, ipsum Apollinem, ipsum Dionysium eundem esse volunt. Hence we find that Bacchus is the Sun, or Apollo; though supposed generally to have been a very different personage. In reality they are all three the same; each of them the Sun. He was the ruling Deity of the world:
[922]Ἡλιε παγγενετορ, παναιολε, χρυσεοφεγγες.
He was in Thrace esteemed, and worshipped as Bacchus, or Liber. [923]In Thraciâ Solem Liberum haberi, quem illi Sebadium nuncupantes magnâ religione celebrant: eique Deo in colle
[924]Zemisso ædes dicata est specie rotundâ. In short, all the Gods were one, as we learn from the same Orphic Poetry:
[925]Ἑις Ζευς, ἑις Αϊδες, ἑις Ἡλιος, ἑις Διονυσος, Ἑις θεος εν παντεσσι.
Some Deities changed with the season.



[926]Ηελιον δε θερους, μετοπωρης δ' ἁβρον Ιαω.
It was therefore idle in the antients to make a disquisition about the identity of any God, as compared with another; and to adjudge him to Jupiter rather than to Mars, to Venus rather than Diana. [927]Τον Οσιριν ὁι μεν Σεραπιν, ὁιδε Διονυσον, ὁιδε Πλουτωνα, τινες δε Δια, πολλοιδε Πανα νενομικασι. Some, says Diodorus, think that Osiris is Serapis; others that he is Dionusus; others still, that he is Pluto: many take him for Zeus, or Jupiter, and not a few for Pan. This was an unnecessary embarrassment: for they were all titles of the same God, there being originally by no means that diversity which is imagined, as Sir John Marsham has very justly
observed. [928]Neque enim tanta πολυθεοτης Gentium, quanta fuit Deorum πολυωνυμια. It is said, above, that Osiris was by some thought to be Jupiter, and by others to be Pluto. But Pluto, among the best theologists, was esteemed the same as Jupiter; and indeed the same as Proserpine, Ceres, Hermes, Apollo, and every other Deity.
[929]Πλουτων, Περσεφονη, Δημητηρ, Κυπρις, Ερωτες, Τριτωνες, Νηρευς, Τηθυς και Κυανοχαιτης, Ἑρμης θ', Ἡφαιστος τε κλυτος, Παν, Ζευς τε, και Ἑρη, Αρτεμις, ηδ' Ἑκαεργος Απολλων, ἑις Θεος εστιν.
There were to be sure a number of strange attributes, which by some of the poets were delegated to different personages; but there were other writers who went deeper in their researches, and made them all centre in one. They sometimes represented this sovereign Deity as Dionusus; who, according to Ausonius, was worshipped in various parts under different titles, and comprehended all the Gods under one character.
[930]Ogygia me Bacchum vocat; Osyrin Ægyptus putat: Mysi Phanacem nominant: Dionyson Indi existimant: Romana Sacra Liberum; Arabica Gens Adoneum; Lucanianus Pantheon.
Sometimes the supremacy was given to Pan, who was esteemed Lord of all the elements.
[931]Πανα καλω, κρατερον Νομιον, κοσμοιο τε συμπαν, Ουρανον, ηδε θαλασσαν, ιδε χθονα παμβασιλειαν, Και πυρ αθανατον, ταδε γαρ μελη εστι τα Πανος. Κοσμοκρατωρ, αυξητα, φαεσφορε, καρπιμε Παιαν, Αντροχαρες, βαρυμηνις, ΑΛΗΘΗΣ ΖΕΥΣ Ὁ ΚΕΡΑΣΤΗΣ.
More generally it was conferred upon Jupiter:
[932]Ζευς εστιν αιθηρ, Ζευς δε γη, Ζευς δ' Ουρανος· Ζευς τοι τα παντα.
Poseidon, God of the sea, was also reputed the chief God, the Deity of Fire. This we may infer from his priest. He was styled a Purcon, and denominated from him, and served in his oracular
temples; as we learn from Pausanias, who says, [933]Ποσειδωνι δ' ὑπηρετην ες τα μαντευματα ειναι Πυρκωνα. He mentions a verse to the same purpose. Συν δε τε Πυρκων αμφιπολος κλυτου Εννοσιγαιου. P'urcon is Ignis vel lucis dominus: and we may know the department of the God from the name of the priest. He was no other than the supreme Deity, the Sun: from whom all were supposed to be derived. Hence Poseidon or Neptune, in the Orphic verses, is, like Zeus, styled the father of Gods and men.
[934] Κλυθι, Ποσειδαον—Ουρανιων, Μακαρων τε Θεων πατερ, ηδε και ανδρων.



In the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon the chief deity went by the name of [935]Ourchol, the same as Archel and Aides of Egypt, whence came the Ἡρακλης, and Hercules of Greece and Rome. Nonnus, who was deeply read in the mythology of these countries, makes all the various departments of the other Gods, as well as their titles, centre in him. He describes him in some good poetry as the head of all.
[936]Αστροχιτων Ἡρακλες, Αναξ πυρος, Ορχαμε κοσμου, Ὑια Χρονου Λυκαβαντα δυωδεκαμηνον ἑλισσων, Ἱππευων ἑλικηδον ὁλον πολον αιθοπι δισκῳ, Κυκλον αγεις μετα κυκλον—Ομβρον αγεις φερεκαρτον, επ' ευωδινι δε γαιῃ Ηεριης ηωον ερευγεται αρδμον εερσης.—Βηλος επ Ευφρηταο, Λιβυς κεκλημενος Αμμων, Απις εφυς Νειλῳος Αραψ Κρονος, Ασσυριος Ζευς.—Ειτε Σαραπις εφυς Αιγυπτιος, ανεφαλος Ζευς, Ει Χρονος, ει Φαεθων πολυωνυμος, ειτε συ Μιθρης, ΗΕΛΙΟΣ ΒΑΒYΛΩΝΟΣ, εν Ἑλλαδι ΔΕΛΦΟΣ ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝ.
All the various titles, we find, are at last comprised in Apollo, or the Sun.
It may appear strange, that Hercules, and Jupiter, or whomever we put for the chief Deity, should be of all ages. This must have been the case, if they were the same as the boy of love, and Bacchus ever young; and were also the representatives of Cronus, and Saturn. But the antients went farther; and described the same Deity under the same name in various stages of life: and
[937]Ulpian speaking of Dionusus, says that he was represented of all ages. Και γαρ παιδα, και
πρεσβυτην, και ανδρα γραφουσιν αυτον. But the most extraordinary circumstance was, that they represented the same Deity of different sexes. A bearded Apollo was uncommon; but Venus with a beard must have been very extraordinary. Yet she is said to have been thus exhibited in Cyprus, under the name of Aphroditus, Αφροδιτος: [938]πωγωνιαν ανδρος την Θεον
εσχηματισθαι εν Κυπρῳ. The same is mentioned by Servius: [939]Est etiam in Cypro simulacrum barbatæ Veneris, corpora et veste muliebri, cum sceptro, et naturâ virili, quod Αφροδιτον vocant. She was also looked upon as prior to Zeus, and to most other of the Gods.
[940]Αφροδιτη ου μονον Αθηνας, και Ἡρας, αλλα και ΔΙΟΣ εστι πρεσβυτερα. The poet
Calvus speaks of her as masculine: [941]Polientemque Deum Venerem. Valerius Soranus among other titles calls Jupiter the mother of the Gods.
[942]Jupiter omnipotens, Regum Rex ipse, Deûmque Progenitor, Genetrixque Deûm; Deus unus et idem.
Synesius speaks of him in nearly the same manner.
[943]Συ πατηρ, συ δ' εσσι μητηρ, Συ δ' αρσην, συ δε θηλυς.
And the like character is given to the antient Deity Μητις.
[944]Αρσην μεν και θηλυς εφυς, πολυωνυμε Μητι.
In one of the fragments of the Orphic poetry there is every thing, which I have been saying comprehended within a very short compass.
[945]Ζευς αρσην γενετο, Ζευς αμβροτος επλετο Νυμφη, Ζευς πυθμην γαιης τε και ουρανου αστεροεντος.—Ζευς ποντου ῥιζα, Ζευς [946]Ἡλιος, ηδε Σεληνη, Ζευς Βασιλευς, Ζευς αυτος ἁπαντων αρχιγενεθλος—Και Μητις, πρωτος γενετωρ και Ερως πολυτερπης. Παντα γαρ εν Ζηνος μεγαλῳ ταδε σωματι κειται.



Ἑν κρατος, ἑις Δαιμων, γενεται μεγας αρχος ἁπαντων.
Whom he meant under the title of Zeus, he explains afterwards in a solemn invocation of the God Dionusus.
[947]Κεκλυθι τηλεπορου δινης ἑλικαυγεα κυκλον Ουρανιαις στροφαλιγξι περιδρομον αιεν ἑλισσων, Αγλαε ΖΕΥ, ΔΙΟΝYΣΕ, πατερ ποντου, πατερ αιης, Ἡλιε, παγγενετορ, παναιολε, χρυσεοφεγγες.
As we have seen how the father of the Gods was diversified, it may be worth while to hear what
the supposed mother of all the Deities says of her titles and departments, in Apuleius. [948]Me primigenii Phryges Pessinuntiam nominant Deûm Matrem: hinc Autochthones Attici Cecropiam Minervam: illinc fluctuantes Cyprii Paphiam Venerem: Cretes sagittiferi Dictynnam Dianam. Siculi trilingues Stygiam Proserpinam: Eleusinii vetustam Deam Cererem. Junonem alii: alii Bellonam: alii Hecaten: Rhamnusiam alii: et qui nascentis dei Solis inchoantibus radiis illustrantur Æthiopes, Ariique, priscâque doctrinâ pollentes Ægyptii, ceremoniis me prorsus propriis percolentes, appellant vero nomine Reginam Isidem.
Porphyry acknowledged, that Vesta, Rhea, Ceres, Themis, Priapus, Proserpina, Bacchus, Attis,
Adonis, Silenus, and the Satyrs, were all one, and the[949] same. Nobody had examined the theology of the antients more deeply than Porphyry. He was a determined Pagan, and his evidence in this point is unexceptionable. The titles of Orus and Osiris being given to Dionusus, caused him in time to partake of the same worship which was paid to the great luminary; and as he had also
many other titles, from them sprung a multiplicity of Deities. [950]Morichum Siculi Bacchum nominârunt: Arabes vero eundem Orachal et Adonæum: alii Lyæum, Erebinthium, Sabazium; Lacedæmonii Scytidem, et Milichium vocitarunt. But let Dionusus or Bacchus be diversified by
ever so many names or titles, they all, in respect to worship, relate ultimately to the Sun. [951]Sit Osiris, sit Omphis, Nilus, Siris, sive quodcunque aliud ab Hierophantis usurpatum nomen, ad unum tandem Solem, antiquissimum Gentium numen, redeunt omnia.

Speaking afterwards of the people at Dodona, he says, Χρονου πολλου διεξελθοντος, επυθοντα εκ της Αιγυπτου απικομενα τα ουνοματα τα τον θεων των αλλων, Διονυσου δε ὑστερον πολλῳ επυθοντο. c. 52. It was a long time before they had names for any of the Gods; and very late before they were acquainted with Dionusus; which Deity, as well as all the others, they received from Egypt. See also l. 2. c. 59.

Jezebel, whose father was Ethbaal, king of Sidon, and whose daughter was Athaliah, seems to have been named from Aza-bel; for all the Sidonian names are compounds of sacred terms.

[113] Anait signifies a fountain of fire; under which name a female Deity was worshipped. Wherever a temple is mentioned, dedicated to her worship, there will be generally found some hot streams, either of water or bitumen; or else salt, and nitrous pools. This is observable at Arbela. Περι Αρβηλα δε εστι και Δημητριας πολις, ειθ' ἡ του ναφθα πηγη, και το πυρα, και το της Αναιας, (or Αναϊτιδος) ἱερον. Strabo. l. 16. p. 1072.

[118] It was an obsolete term, but to be traced in its derivatives. From Ees-El came Ασυλον, Asylum: from El-Ees, Elis, Elissa, Eleusis, Eleusinia Sacra, Elysium, Elysii campi in Egypt and elsewhere.
[119] Of those places called Lasa many instances might be produced. The fountain at Gortyna in Crete was very sacred, and called Lasa, and Lysa. There was a tradition, that Jupiter when a child was washed in its waters: it was therefore changed to Λουσα. Pausanias says, ὑδωρ ψυχροτατον παρεχεται ποταμων. l. 8. p. 685.
In Judea were some medicinal waters and warm springs of great repute, at a place called of old Lasa. Lasa ipsa est, quæ nunc Callirrhoë dicitur, ubi aquæ calidæ in Mare

The worship of Elisa was carried to Carthage from Canaan and Syria: in these parts she was first worshipped; and her temple from that worship was called Eliza Beth.
[210] Sarbeth or Sarabeth is of the same analogy, being put for Beth-Sar or Sara, οικος
κυριου, or κυριακη; as a feminine, answering to the house of our Lady. Απο ορους

[211] Damascus is called by the natives Damasec, and Damakir. The latter signifies the town of Dama or Adama: by which is not meant Adam, the father of mankind; but Ad Ham, the Lord Ham, the father of the Amonians. Abulfeda styles Damascus, Damakir, p. 15. Sec or Shec is a prince. Damasec signifies principis Ad-Amæ (Civitas). From a notion however of Adama signifying Adam, a story prevailed that he was buried at Damascus. This is so far useful, as to shew that Damasec was an abbreviation of Adamasec, and Damakir of Adama-kir.

Anath signified the fountain of light, and was abbreviated Nath and Neith by the Egyptians. They worshipped under this title a divine emanation, supposed to be the Goddess of Wisdom. The Athenians, who came from Sais in Egypt, were denominated from this Deity, whom they expressed Ath-An, or Αθηνη, after the Ionian manner. Της πολεως (Σαϊτων) Θεος αρχηγος εστιν, Αιγυπτιστι μεν τ' ουνομα Νηϊθ, Ἑλληνιστι δε, ὡς ὁ εκεινων λογος, Αθηνα. Plato in Timæo. p. 21.

[215] The same term is not always uniformly expressed even by the sacred writers. They vary at different times both in respect to names of places and of men. What is in Numbers, c. 13. 8, הושע , Hoshea, is in Joshua. c. 1. v. 1. יהושע Jehoshua: and in the Acts, c. 7. v. 45. Jesus, Ιησους. Balaam the son of Beor, Numbers, c. 22. v. 5. is called the son of Bosor, 2 Peter. c. 2. v. 15.

Some late editors, and particularly Harduin, not knowing that Achor was worshipped at Cyrene, as the Θεος απομυιος, have omitted his name, and transferred the history to Elis. But all the antient editions mention Achor of Cyrene; Cyrenaici Achorem Deum, &c. I have examined those printed at Rome, 1470, 1473. those of Venice, 1472, 1476, 1487, 1507, 1510. those of Parma, 1476, 1479, 1481. one at Brescia, 1496. the editions at Paris, 1516, 1524, 1532. the Basil edition by Froben, 1523: and they all have this reading. The edition also by Johannes Spira, 1469, has Acorem, but with some variation. The spurious reading, Elei myagrum Deum, was, I imagine, first admitted into the text by Sigismund Gelenius, who was misled by the similarity of the two histories. Harduin has followed him blindly, without taking any notice of the more antient and true reading.

[377] All thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth Arbel in the day of battle. The mother was dashed in pieces upon her children. Hosea. c. 10. v. 14. Ar in this place does not signify a city; but אור , the title of the Deity: from whence was derived ἱερος of the Greeks. The seventy, according to some of their best copies, have
rendered Beth Arbel οικον Ιερο-Βααλ, which is no improper version of Beth-Aur-Bel. In some copies we find it altered to the house of Jeroboam; but this is a mistake for Jero-Baal. Arbelus is by some represented as the first deified mortal. Cyril contra Julian. l. 1. p. 10. and l. 3. p. 110.

Kircher says, that Pi in the Coptic is a prefix, by which a noun is known to be masculine, and of the singular number: and that Pa is a pronoun possessive. Paromi is Vir meus. It may be so in the Coptic: but in antient times Pi, Pa, Phi, were only variations of the same article: and were indifferently put before all names: of which I have given many instances.

We are much indebted to the learned father Theophilus of Antioch: he had great knowledge; yet could not help giving way to this epidemical weakness.

We may be assured that these were the author's own sentiments, though attributed to another person: hence we must not wonder if his veracity be sometimes called in question; add to this, that he was often through ignorance mistaken: Πολλα τον Ἡροδοτον ελεγχει (Μανεθων) των Αιγυπτιακων ὑπ' αγνοιας εψευσμενον.

How could Io be married to him when she was to him in degree of ascent, as far off as his grandmother's great grandmother; that is six removes above him. See Scaliger on Euseb. ad Num. cccclxxxi.

Plutarch assures us, that Homer was not known to the Athenians till the time of Hipparchus, about the 63d Olympiad, yet some writers make him three, some four, some five hundred years before that æra.

[563] Bozrah, a citadel, they changed to βυρσα, a skin. Out of Ar, the capital of Moab, they formed Areopolis, the city of the Mars. The river Jaboc they expressed Io Bacchus. They did not know that diu in the east signified an island: and therefore out of DiuSocotra in the Red-Sea, they formed the island Dioscorides: and from Diu-Ador, or Adorus, they made an island Diodorus. The same island Socotra they sometimes denominated the island of Socrates. The place of fountains, Ai-Ain, they attributed to Ajax, and called it Αιαντος ακροτηριον, in the same sea. The antient frontier town of
Egypt, Rhinocolura, they derived from ρις, ρινος, a nose: and supposed that some people's noses were here cut off. Pannonia they derived from the Latin pannus, cloth. So Nilus was from νη ιλυς: Gadeira quasi Γης δειρα. Necus in Egypt and Ethiopia
signified a king: but such kings they have turned to νεκυας: and the city of Necho, or Royal City, to Νικοπολις and Νεκροπολις.
Lysimachus in his Egyptian history changed the name of Jerusalem to Ιεροσυλα: and supposed that the city was so called because the Israelites in their march to Canaan used to plunder temples, and steal sacred things. See Josephus contra Ap. l. 1. c. 34. p. 467.
[564] I do not mean to exclude the Romans, though I have not mentioned them; as the chief of the knowledge which they afford is the product of Greece. However, it must be confessed, that we are under great obligations to Pliny, Marcellinus, Arnobius, Tertullian, Lactantius, Jerome, Macrobius; and many others. They contain many necessary truths, wherever they may have obtained them.

[592] Go-zan is the place, or temple, of the Sun. I once thought that Goshen, or, as it is sometimes expressed, Gozan, was the same as Cushan: but I was certainly mistaken. The district of Goshen was indeed the nome of Cushan; but the two words are not of the same purport. Goshen is the same as Go-shan, and Go-zan, analogous to Beth-shan, and signifies the place of the Sun. Go-shen, Go-shan, Go-zan, and Gau-zan, are all variations of the same name. In respect to On, there were two cities so called. The one was in Egypt, where Poti-phera was Priest. Genesis. c. 41. v. 45. The other stood in Arabia, and is mentioned by the Seventy: Ων, ἡ εστιν Ἡλιουπολις. Exodus. c. 1. v. 11. This was also called Onium, and Hanes, the Iänisus of Herodotus.

Strabo supposes that the Campus Hyrcanus was so named from the Persians; as also Κυρου πεδιον, near it; but they seem to have been so denominated ab origine. The river Organ, which ran, into the Mæander from the Campus Hyrcanus, was properly Urchan. Ancyra was An-cura, so named a fonte Solis κυρος γαρ ὁ ἡλιος. All the names throughout the country have a correspondence: all relate either to the soil, or the religion of the natives; and betray a great antiquity.

[761] We learn from Numbers. c. 22. v. 36. and c. 31. v. 8. that the residence of Balaam was in Midian, on the other side of the river to the south, beyond the borders of Moab. This seems to have been the situation of Petra; which was either in Midian or upon the borders of it: so that Pethor, and Petra, were probably the same place. Petra is by the English traveller, Sandys, said to be called now Rath Alilat.
Petra by some is called a city of Palestine: Πετρα πολις Παλαιστινης. Suidas. But it was properly in Arabia, not far from Idume, or Edom. See Relandi Palæstina. p. 930. and Strabo. l. 16.

Young women were, by the later Greeks, and by the Romans, styled Nymphæ; but improperly.

Ægyptijs, sicut omnia animalia, lapides, frutices, atque herbas, ita omne membrum atque omnia corporis humani loca, aliquo dei titulo mos fuit denotare. Hinc cor nuncupabant Ath, uterum Mathyr, vel Mether: et fontem fœmineum, sicut et alios fontes, nomine Ain Omphe, Græce νυμφη,

[832] Naptha is called Apthas by Simplicius in Categoric. Aristotelis. Και ὁ Αφθας
δεχεται ποῤῥωθεν του πυρος ειδος. The same by Gregory Nyssen is contracted,
and called, after the Ionic manner, Φθης: ὡσπερ ὁ καλουμενος Φθης εξαπτεται. Liber de animâ. On which account these writers are blamed by the learned Valesius. They are, however, guilty of no mistake; only use the word out of composition. AinAptha, contracted Naptha, was properly the fountain itself: the matter which proceeded from it was styled Apthas, Pthas, and Ptha. It was one of the titles of the God of fire, called Apha-Astus, the Hephastus of the Greeks; to whom this inflammable substance was sacred.

[838] Strabo. Ibidem. l. 7. p. 487. He supposes that it was called Ampelitis from αμπελος, the vine: because its waters were good to kill vermin, Ακος της
φθειριωσης αμπελου. A far fetched etymology. Neither Strabo, nor Posidonius, whom he quotes, considers that the term is of Syriac original.

According to the acceptation, in which I understand the term, we may account for so many places in the east being styled Petra. Persis and India did not abound with rocks more than Europe; yet, in these parts, as well as in the neighbouring regions, there is continually mention made of Petra: such as Πετρα Σισιμιθρου in Sogdiana, Petra Aornon in India, και την του Οξου (Πετραν), ὁι δε Αριαμαζου. Strabo. l. 11. p. 787. Petra Abatos in Egypt, Πετρα Ναβαταια in Arabia. Many places called Petra occur in the history of Alexander: Ἑλειν δε και Πετρας ερυμνας σφοδρα εκ προδοσεως. Strabo. l. 11. p. 787. They were in reality sacred eminences, where of old they worshipped; which in aftertimes were fortified. Every place styled Arx and Ακροπολις was originally of the same nature. The same is to be observed of those styled Purgoi.

PHŒNIX PHŒNICES.
As there has been much uncertainty about the purport and extent of these terms; and they are of great consequence in the course of history; I will endeavour to state their true meaning. Phoinic, or Poinic, was an Egyptian and Canaanitish term of honour; from whence were formed Φοινιξ, Φοινικες,
Φοινικοεις of the Greeks, and Phoinic, Poinicus, Poinicius of the Romans; which were afterwards
changed to Phœnix, Punicus, and [1]Puniceus. It was originally a title, which the Greeks made use of as a provincial name: but it was never admitted as such by the people, to whom it was thus appropriated, till the Greeks were in possession of the country. And even then it was but partially received: for though mention is made of the coast of Phœnice, yet we find the natives called Sidonians, Tyrians, and
[2]Canaanites, as late as the days of the Apostles. It was an honorary term, compounded of Anac with the Egyptian prefix; and rendered at times both Phoinic and Poinic. It signified a lord or prince: and was particularly assumed by the sons of Chus and Canaan. The Mysians seem to have kept nearest to the original pronunciation, who gave this title to the God Dionusus, and called him Ph'anac.
[3]Ogygia me Bacchum vocat, Osirin Ægyptus putat, Mysi Phanacem.
It was also conferred upon many things, which were esteemed princely and noble. Hence the red, or scarlet, a colour appropriated to great and honourable personages, was styled Phoinic. The palm was



also styled Phoinic, Φοινιξ: and the antients always speak of it as a stately and noble tree. It was esteemed an emblem of honour; and made use of as a reward of victory. Plurimarum palmarum homo, was a proverbial expression among the Romans, for a soldier of merit. Pliny speaks of the various species of palms; and of the great repute in which they were held by the Babylonians. He says, that the noblest of them were styled the royal Palms; and supposes that they were so called from their being set apart for the king's use. But they were very early an emblem of royalty: and it is a circumstance
included in their original name. We find from Apuleius, that Mercury, the
[4]
Hermes of Egypt, was represented with a palm branch in his hand: and his priests at Hermopolis used to have them stuck in
their
[5]
sandals, on the outside. The Goddess
[6]
Isis was thus represented: and we may infer that Hermes had the like ornaments; which the Greeks mistook for feathers, and have in consequence of it added wings to his feet. The Jews used to carry boughs of the same tree at some of their festivals; and particularly at the celebration of their nuptials: and it was thought to have an influence at the birth. Euripides alludes to this in his Ion; where he makes Latona recline herself against a Palm tree, when she is going to produce Apollo and Diana.
[7]
Φοινικα Παρ' ἁβροκομαν Ενθα λοχευματα σεμν' ελοχευσατο Λατω.
In how great estimation this tree was held of old, we may learn from many passages in the sacred
writings. Solomon says to his espoused,
[8]
how fair and how pleasant art thou, O Love, for delights: thy
stature is like a Palm tree. And the Psalmist for an encouragement to holiness, says,
[9]
that the righteous shall flourish like the Palm tree: for the Palm was supposed to rise under a weight; and to thrive in
proportion to its being
[10]
depressed. There is possibly a farther allusion in this, than may at first appear. The antients had an opinion, that the Palm was immortal: at least, if it did die, it recovered again, and obtained a second life by renewal. Hence the story of the bird, styled the Phoenix, is thought to have
been borrowed from this tree. Pliny, in describing the species of Palm, styled Syagrus, says,
[11]
Mirum de eâ accepimus, cum Phœnice Ave, quæ putatur ex hujus Palmæ argumento nomen accepisse, iterum mori, et renasci ex seipsà. Hence we find it to have been an emblem of immortality among all nations,
sacred and prophane. The blessed in heaven are represented in the Apocalypse by St. John,
[12]
as standing before the throne in white robes, with branches of Palm in their hands. The notion of this plant being an emblem of royalty prevailed so far, that when our Saviour made his last entrance into
Jerusalem, the people took branches of Palm trees, and accosted him as a prince, crying,
[13]
Hosannablessed is the King of Israel.
The title of Phoinic seems at first to have been given to persons of great stature: but, in process of time, it was conferred upon people of power and eminence, like αναξ and ανακτες among the Greeks. The
Cuthites in Egypt were styled Royal Shepherds, Βασιλεις Ποιμενες, and had therefore the title of Phœnices. A colony of them went from thence to Tyre and Syria: hence it is said by many writers that Phœnix came from Egypt to Tyre. People, not considering this, have been led to look for the shepherd's origin in Canaan, because they were sometimes called Phœnices. They might as well have looked for
them in Greece; for they were equally styled
[14]
Ἑλληνες, Hellenes. Phœnicia, which the Greeks called
Φοινικη, was but a small part of Canaan. It was properly a slip of sea coast, which lay within the jurisdiction of the Tyrians and Sidonians, and signifies Ora Regia; or, according to the language of the country, the coast of the Anakim. It was a lordly title, and derived from a stately and august people. All the natives of Canaan seem to have assumed to themselves great honour. The Philistines are spoken of
as
[15]
Lords, and the merchants of Tyre as Princes; whose grandeur and magnificence are often alluded
to in the Scriptures. The prophet Ezekiel calls them the princes of the sea.
[16]
Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments.
And Isaiah speaks to the same purpose.
[17]
Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, that crowning city, whose merchants are princes; whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth? The scripture term by which they are here distinguished is שרים , Sarim: but the title which they assumed to themselves was Ph'anac, or Ph'oinac, the Phœnix of the Greeks and Romans. And as it was a mere title, the sacred writers of the old testament never make use of it to distinguish either the people or country. This part of Canaan is never by them called Phœnicia: yet others did call it so; and the natives were styled Phœnices before the birth of Homer. But this was through mistake; for it was never used by the natives as a provincial appellation. I have shewn that it was a title of another sort, a mark of rank and pre-eminence: on this account it was assumed by other people, and conferred upon other places. For this reason it is never mentioned by any of the sacred writers before the captivity, in order to avoid ambiguity. The Gentile writers made use of it; and we see what mistakes have ensued. There were Phœnicians of
various countries. They were to be found upon the Sinus
[18]
Persicus, upon the Sinus
[19]
Arabicus, in
Egypt, in
[20]
Crete, in
[21]
Africa, in
[22]
Epirus, and even in Attica.
[23]
Φοινικες—γενος τι Αθηνῃσι.
There is a race of people called Phœnicians among the
[24]
Athenians. In short, it was a title introduced



at Sidon, and the coast adjoining, by people from Egypt: and who the people were that brought it may be known from several passages in antient history; but particularly from an extract in Eusebius, [25]Φοινιξ και Καδμος, απο Θηβων των Αιγυπτιων εξελθοντες εις την Συριαν, Τυρου και Σιδωνος εβασιλευον. Phœnix and Cadmus, retiring from Thebes, in Egypt, towards the coast of
Syria, settled at Tyre and Sidon, and reigned there. It is said, that [26]Belus carried a colony to the same
parts: and from what part of the world [27]Belus must be supposed to have come, needs not to be explained. Euripides styles Cepheus the king of Ethiopia, the son of Phœnix: and Apollodorus makes him the son of Belus: hence we may infer, that Belus and Phœnix were the same. Not that there were any such persons as Phœnix and Belus, for they were certainly titles: and, under the characters of those two personages, Colonies, named Belidæ and Phœnices, went abroad, and settled in different parts. Their history and appellation may be traced from Babylonia to Arabia and Egypt; and from thence to Canaan, and to the regions in the west. It were therefore to be wished, that the terms Phœnix and Phœnicia had never been used in the common acceptation; at least when the discourse turns upon the more antient history of Canaan. When the Greeks got possession of the coast of Tyre, they called it Phœnicia: and from that time it may be admitted as a provincial name. In consequence of this, the writers of the New Testament do not scruple to make use of it, but always with a proper limitation; for the geography of the Scriptures is wonderfully exact. But the Greek and Roman writers often speak of it with a greater latitude, and include Judea and Palestina within its borders; and sometimes add Syria and Idume. But these countries were all separate and distinct; among which Phœnicia bore but a small proportion. Yet, small as it may have been, many learned men have thought, that all the colonies, which at times settled upon the coast of the Mediterranean, were from this quarter; and that all science was of Phœnician original. But this is not true according to their acceptation of the term. Colonies did settle; and science came from the east: but not merely from the Sidonian. I shall shew, that it was principally owing to a prior and superior branch of the family.
ADDENDA.
OF THE PALM TREE.
Phœnix was a colour among horses. They were styled Phœnices, and [28]Phœniciati, from the colour of the Palm tree, which they resembled; and upon the same account had the name of Spadices. This,
according to Aulus Gellius, was a term synonymous with the former. [29]Rutilus, et Spadix Phœnicii συνωνυμος, exuberantiam splendoremque significant ruboris, quales sunt fructus Palmæ arboris,
nondum sole incocti: unde spadicis et Phœnicei nomen est. [30]Spadix, σπαδιξ, avulsus est a Palmâ termes cum fructu. Homer, describing the horses of Diomedes, says, that the one was Phœnix, or of a bright Palm colour, with a white spot in his forehead like a moon.
[31]Ὁς το μεν αλλο τοσον φοινιξ ην, ενδε μετωπῳ Λευκον σημ' ετετυκτο περιτροχον ηϋτε μηνη.
Upon this the Scholiast observes, Φοινικες το χρωμα, ητοι πυῤῥος. The horse was of a Palm colour, which is a bright red. We call such horses bays, which probably is a term of the same original. The branch of a Palm tree was called Bai in Egypt; and it had the same name in other places. Baia, Βαια, are
used for Palm-branches by St. John. [32]Τα βαια των Φοινικων. And it is mentioned by the author of
the book of Maccabees, that the Jews, upon a solemn occasion, entered the temple. [33]Μετα αινεσεως
και βαιων. And Demetrius writes to the high priest, Simon, [34]Τον στεφανον τον χρυσουν και
την Βαϊνην, ἁ απεστειλατε, κεκομισμεθα. Coronam auream et Bainem, quæ misistis, accepimus.
The Greeks formed the word βαϊνη from the Egyptian Bai. The Romans called the same colour Badius.
[35]Varro, speaking of horses, mentions,
Hic badius, ille gilvus, ille Murinus.
As the Palm tree was supposed to be immortal; or, at least, if it did die, to revive, and enjoy a second
life, the Egyptians gave the name of Bai to the soul: [36]Εστι μεν γαρ το βαι ψυχη.
OF THE
T CAHEN:



THE
COHEN, כהן , OF THE HEBREWS.
I have before taken notice that the term Cahen denoted a Priest, or President; and that it was a title often conferred upon princes and kings. Nor was it confined to men only: we find it frequently annexed to the names of Deities, to signify their rule and superintendency over the earth. From them it was derived to their attendants, and to all persons of a prophetical or sacred character. The meaning of the term was so obvious, that one would imagine no mistake could have ensued: yet such is the perverseness of human wit, that we find it by the Greeks and Romans constantly misapplied. They could not help imagining, from the sound of the word, which approached nearly to that of κυων and canis, that it had some reference to that animal: and, in consequence of this unlucky resemblance, they continually
misconstrued it a dog. Hence we are told by
[37]
Ælian and
[38]
Plutarch, not only of the great veneration paid to dogs in Egypt, and of their being maintained in many cities and temples; in which they certainly exceed the truth; but we are moreover assured, that the people of Ethiopia had a dog for their king: that he was kept in great state, being surrounded with a numerous body of officers and guards, and in all
respects royally treated. Plutarch speaks of him as being
[39]
σεμνως προσκυνομενος, worshipped with a degree of religious reverence. The whole of this notion took its rise from a misinterpretation of the title above. I have mentioned, that in early times Cahen was a title universally conferred upon priests and prophets: hence Lycophron, who has continually allusions to obsolete terms, calls the two diviners, Mopsus and Amphilochus, Κυνας.
[40]
Δοιαιδε ῥειθρων Πυραμου προς εκβολαις Αυτοκτονοις σφαγαισι Δηραινου ΚYΝΕΣ Δμηθεντες αιχμαζουσι λοισθιον βοαν.
Upon which the Scholiast observes: Κυνες ὁι Μαντεις: by Cunes are meant Diviners: and again,
Κυνας Απολλωνος τους μαντεις ειπειν. The Poet, by Κυνας, means the ministers and prophets of
Apollo. Upon this the learned
[41]
Meursius observes, that Lycophron had here made use of a term imported from Egypt: so that, I think, we cannot be mistaken about the purport of the word, however it may have been perverted.
The name of the Deity, Canouphis, expressed also Canuphis, and Cnuphis, was compounded with this term. He was represented by the Egyptians as a princely person, with a serpent entwined round his middle, and embellished with other characteristics, relating to time and duration, of which the serpent was an emblem. Oph, and Ouph, signified a serpent in the Amonian language; and the Deity was termed Can-uph, from his serpentine representation. The whole species, in consequence of this, were made sacred to him, and styled Canyphian. To this Lucan alludes, when, in speaking of the Seps, he calls all the tribe of serpents Cinyphias pestes:
[42]
Cinyphias inter pestes tibi palma nocendi.
Canuphis was sometimes expressed Anuphis and Anubis; and, however rendered, was by the Greeks and Romans continually spoken of as a dog; at least they supposed him to have had a dog's head, and
often mention his
[43]
barking. But they were misled by the title, which they did not understand. The Egyptians had many emblematical personages, set off with heads of various animals, to represent particular virtues and affections, as well as to denote the various attributes of their Gods. Among others was this canine figure, which I have no reason to think was appropriated to Canuph, or Cneph. And though upon gems and marbles his name may be sometimes found annexed to this character, yet it must be looked upon as a Grecian work, and so denominated in consequence of their mistaken notion. For we must make a material distinction between the hieroglyphics of old, when Egypt was under her own kings; and those of later date, when that country was under the government of the Greeks: at which time their learning was greatly impaired, and their antient theology ruined. Horus Apollo assures us, if any credit may be given to what he says, that this canine figure was an emblem of the earth: [44]
Οικουμενην γραφοντες κυνοκεφαλον ζωγραφουσι. When they would describe the earth, they paint a Cunocephalus. It could not, therefore, I should think, in any degree relate to Canuphis. The
same
[45]
writer informs us, that under the figure of a dog they represented a priest, or sacred scribe, and a prophet; and all such as had the chief management of funerals: also the spleen, the smell, sneezing; rule and government, and a magistrate, or judge: which is a circumstance hardly to be believed. For, as hieroglyphics were designed to distinguish, it is scarce credible that the Egyptians should crowd together so many different and opposite ideas under one character, whence nothing could well ensue but doubt and confusion. Besides, I do not remember, that in any group of antient hieroglyphics the figure of a dog occurs. The meaning of this history, I think, may be with a little attention made out. The Egyptians were refined in their superstitions, above all the nations in the world; and conferred the names and titles of their Deities upon vegetables and animals of every species; and not only upon these, but



also upon the parts of the human body, and the very passions of the mind. Whatever they deemed
salutary, or of great value, they distinguished by the title of Sacred, and consecrated it to some [46]God. This will appear from words borrowed from Egypt. The Laurel, Laurus, was denominated from AlOrus: the berry was termed bacca, from Bacchus; Myrrh, Μυῤῥα was from Ham-Ourah; Casia, from Chus. The Crocodile was called Caimin and Campsa; the Lion, El-Eon; the Wolf, El-Uc; the Cat, AlOurah: whence the Greeks formed λεων, λυκος, αιλουρος. The Egyptians styled Myrrh, Baal;
balsam, baal-samen; Camphire, Cham-phour, καμφουρα of Greece; Opium, Ophion. The sweet reed of
Egypt was named [47]Canah, and Conah, by way of eminence; also, [48]Can-Osiris. Cinnamon was denominated from Chan-Amon; Cinnabar, κινναβαρις, from Chan-Abor; the sacred beetle, Cantharus, from Chan-Athur. The harp was styled Cinnor, and was supposed to have been found out by Cinaras; which terms are compounded of Chan-Or, and Chan-Arez; and relate to the Sun, or Apollo, the supposed inventor of the lyre. Priests and magistrates were particularly honoured with the additional title of Cahen; and many things held sacred were liable to have it in their composition. Hence arose the error of Horus Apollo; who, having been informed that the antient Egyptians distinguished many things which were esteemed holy by this sacred title, referred the whole to hieroglyphics, and gave out that they were all represented under the figure of a dog. And it is possible, that in later times the Grecian artists, and the mixed tribes of Egypt, may have expressed them in this manner; for they were led by the
ear; and did not inquire into the latent purport of the [49]theology transmitted to them. From hence we may perceive how little, in later times, even the native Egyptians knew of their rites and history.
Farther accounts may be produced from the same writer, in confirmation of what I have been saying. He not only mentions the great veneration paid by the Egyptians to dogs, but adds, that in many temples they kept κυνοκεφαλοι, a kind of baboons, or animals with heads like those of dogs, which were wonderfully endowed. By their assistance the Egyptians found out the particular periods of the Sun and Moon. These did not, like other animals, die at once, but by piece-meal; so that one half of the animal
was oftentimes buried, while the other half[50] survived. He moreover assures us, that they could read and write; and whenever one of them was introduced into the sacred apartments for probation, the priest
presented him with a [51]tablet, and with a pen and ink; and by his writing could immediately find out if he were of the true intelligent breed. These animals are said to have been of infinite use to the antient Egyptians in determining times and seasons; for it seems they were, in some particular functions, the
most accurate and punctual of any creatures upon earth: [52]Per æquinoctia enim duodecies in die
urinam reddere, et in nocte[53] compertus (Cunocephalus), æquali interstitio servato, Trismegisto ansam
dedit diem dividendi in duodecim partes æquales. Such is the history of these wonderful [54]animals. That Apes and Baboons were, among the Egyptians, held in veneration, is very certain. The Ape was
sacred to the God Apis; and by the Greeks was rendered Capis, and [55]Ceipis. The Baboon was
denominated from the Deity[56] Babon, to whom it was equally sacred. But what have these to do with the supposed Cunocephalus, which, according to the Grecian interpretation, is an animal with the head of a dog? This characteristic does not properly belong to any species of Apes, but seems to have been unduly appropriated to them. The term Cunocephalus, Κυνοκεφαλος, is an Egyptian compound: and this strange history relates to the priests of the country, styled Cahen; also to the novices in their temples; and to the examinations, which they were obliged to undergo, before they could be admitted to the priesthood. To explain this, I must take notice, that in early times they built their temples upon eminences, for many reasons; but especially for the sake of celestial observations. The Egyptians were much addicted to the study of astronomy: and they used to found their colleges in Upper Egypt upon rocks and hills, called by them Caph. These, as they were sacred to the Sun, were farther denominated Caph-El, and sometimes Caph-Aur, and Caph-Arez. The term Caph-El, which often occurs in history, the Greeks uniformly changed to Κεφαλη, Cephale: and from Cahen-Caph-El, the sacred rock of Orus,
they formed Κυνοκεφαλη, and Κυνοκεφαλος; which they supposed to relate to an animal with the head of a dog. But this Cahen-Caph-El was certainly some royal seminary in Upper Egypt, whence they drafted novices to supply their colleges and temples. These young persons were, before their introduction, examined by some superior priest; and, accordingly as they answered upon their trial, they were admitted, or refused. They were denominated Caph-El, and Cahen-Caph-El, from the academy where they received their first instruction; and this place, though sacred, seems to have been of a class subordinate to others. It was a kind of inferior cloister and temple, such as Capella in the Romish church; which, as well as Capellanus, was derived from Egypt: for, the church, in its first decline, borrowed largely from that country. That there was some particular place of this sort situated upon a rock or eminence, may, I think, be proved from Martianus Capella; and, moreover, that it was a seminary well known, where the youth of Upper Egypt were educated. For, in describing the sciences, under different personages, he gives this remarkable account of Dialectica upon introducing her before
his audience. [57]Hæc se educatam dicebat in Ægyptiorum Rupe; atque in Parmenidis exinde gymnasium, atque Atticam demeasse. And Johannes Sarisburiensis seems to intimate that Parmenides
obtained his knowledge from the same quarter, when he mentions [58]"in Rupe vitam egisse. In this short detail we have no unpleasing account of the birth of science in Egypt, and of its progress thence to



Attica. It is plain that this Rupes Ægyptiaca could be nothing else but a seminary, either the same, or at least similar to that, which I have before been describing. As the Cunocephali are said to have been sacred to Hermes, this college and temple were probably in the nome of Hermopolis. Hermes was the
patron of Science, and particularly styled Cahen, or [59]Canis: and the Cunocephali are said to have been
worshipped by the people of that [60]place. They were certainly there reverenced: and this history points out very plainly the particular spot alluded to. Hermopolis was in the upper region styled Thebaïs: and
there was in this district a tower, such as has been [61]mentioned. It was in aftertimes made use of for a repository, where they laid up the tribute. This may have been the Rupes Ægyptiaca, so famed of old for science; and which was the seat of the Chancephalim, or Cunocephalians.
It is said of the Cunocephali, that when one part was dead and buried, the other still survived. This can relate to nothing else but a society, or body politic, where there is a continual decrement, yet part still remains; and the whole is kept up by succession. It is an enigma, which particularly relates to the priesthood in Egypt: for the sacred office there was hereditary, being vested in certain families; and
when part was dead, a residue still [62]survived, who admitted others in the room of the deceased.
[63]Επεαν δε τις αποθανῃ, τουτου ὁ παις αντικατισταται. The sons, we find, supplied the place of their fathers: hence the body itself never became extinct, being kept up by a regular succession. As to the Cunocephali giving to Hermes the first hint of dividing the day into twelve parts from the exactness,
which was observed in their [64]evacuations, it is a surmise almost too trifling to be discussed. I have shewn that the Cunocephali were a sacred college, whose members were persons of great learning: and their society seems to have been a very antient institution. They were particularly addicted to astronomical observations; and by contemplating the heavens, styled Ouran, they learned to distinguish the seasons, and to divide the day into parts. But the term Ouran the Greeks by a strange misconception changed to ουρειν; of which mistake they have afforded other instances: and from this abuse of terms the silly figment took its rise.
The Cunocephali are not to be found in Egypt only, but in India likewise; and in other parts of the
world. Herodotus [65]mentions a nation of this name in Libya: and speaks of them as a race of men with the heads of dogs. Hard by in the neighbourhood of this people he places the Ακεφαλοι, men with no heads at all: to whom, out of humanity, and to obviate some very natural distresses, he gives eyes in the breast. But he seems to have forgot mouth and ears, and makes no mention of a nose: he only says,
[66]Ακεφαλοι, ὁι εν στηθεσιν οφθαλμους εχοντες. Both these and the Cunocephali were denominated from their place of residence, and from their worship: the one from Cahen-Caph-El, the other from Ac-Caph-El: each of which appellations is of the same purport, the right noble, or sacred
[67]rock of the Sun.
Similar to the history of the Cunocephali, and Acephali, is that of the Cunodontes. They are a people mentioned by Solinus and Isidorus, and by them are supposed to have had the teeth of dogs. Yet they were probably denominated, like those above, from the object of their worship, the Deity Chan-Adon;
which the Greeks expressed Κυνοδων, and styled his votaries [68]Cunodontes.
The Greeks pretended, that they had the use of the sphere, and were acquainted with the zodiac, and its asterisms very early. But it is plain from their mistakes, that they received the knowledge of these things very late; at a time when the terms were obsolete, and the true purport of them not to be obtained. They borrowed all the schemes under which the stars are comprehended from the Egyptians: who had formed them of old, and named them from circumstances in their own religion and mythology. They had particularly conferred the titles of their Deities upon those stars, which appeared the brightest in their hemisphere. One of the most remarkable and brilliant they called Cahen Sehor; another they termed Purcahen; a third Cahen Ourah, or Cun Ourah. These were all misconstrued, and changed by the Greeks; Cahen-Sehor to Canis Sirius; P'urcahen to Procyon; and Cahen Ourah to Cunosoura, the dog's tail. In respect to this last name I think, from the application of it in other instances, we may be assured that it could not be in acceptation what the Greeks would persuade us: nor had it any relation to a dog.
There was the summit of a hill in Arcadia of this [69]name: also a promontory in [70]Attica; and another
in [71]Eubœa. How could it possibly in its common acceptation be applicable to these places? And as a constellation if it signified a dog's tail, how came it to be a name given to the tail of a bear? It was a
term brought from [72]Sidon, and Egypt: and the purport was to be sought for from the language of the Amonians.
The antient Helladians used upon every promontory to raise pillars and altars to the God of light, CanOur, the Chan-Orus of Egypt. But Can-Our, and Can-Ourah, they changed to κυνοσουρα, as I have shewn: yet notwithstanding this corruption, the true name is often to be discovered. The place which is termed Cunosoura by Lucian, in his Icaromemenippus, is called Cunoura by Stephanus Byzant, and by
[73]Pausanias. Cunoura is also used by Lycophron, who understood antient terms full well, for any high rock or headland.



[74]Εν ἁισι προς κυνουρα καμπυλους σχασας Πευκης οδοντας.
Προς κυνουρα, προς τραχειας πετρας. Scholiast. ibid.
We find the same mistake occur in the account transmitted to us concerning the first discovery of purple. The antients very gratefully gave the merit of every useful and salutary invention to the Gods. Ceres was supposed to have discovered to men corn, and bread: Osiris shewed them the use of the plough; Cinyras of the harp: Vesta taught them to build. Every Deity was looked up to as the cause of some blessing. The Tyrians and Sidonians were famous for the manufacture of purple: the die of which was very exquisite, and the discovery of it was attributed to Hercules of Tyre; the same who by Palæphatus
is styled Hercules [75]Philosophus. But some will not allow him this honour; but say, that the dog of Hercules was the discoverer. For accidentally feeding upon the Murex, with which the coast abounded,
the dog stained his mouth with the ichor of the fish; and from hence the first hint of dying was [76]taken.
This gave birth to the proverbial expression, [77]Ἑυρημα κυνος ην ἡ σεβαστη πορφυρα. Nonnus mentions the particular circumstance of the dog's staining his mouth:
[78]Χιονεας πορφυρε παρηϊδας ἁιματι κοχλου.
Such is the story, which at first sight is too childish to admit of credit. It is not likely that a dog would feed upon shell-fish: and if this may at any time have happened, yet whoever is at all conversant in natural history, must know, that the murex is of the turbinated kind, and particularly aculeated; having strong and sharp protuberances, with which a dog would hardly engage. The story is founded upon the same misconception, of which so many instances have been produced. Hercules of Tyre, like all other
oriental divinities, was styled Cahen, and Cohen; as was allowed by the Greeks themselves. [79]Τον
Ἡρακλην φασι κατα την Αιγυπτιων διαλεκτον ΧΩΝΑ λεγεσθαι. We are told, that Hercules in the language of the Egyptians is called Chon. This intelligence, however, they could not abide by; but
changed this sacred title to [80]κυων, a dog, which they described as an attendant upon the Deity.
The Grecians tell us, that the Egyptians styled Hermes a dog: but they seem to have been aware, that they were guilty of an undue representation. Hence Plutarch tries to soften, and qualify what is
mentioned, by saying, [81]Ου γαρ κυριως τον Ἑρμην ΚYΝΑ λεγουσιν (ὁι Αιγυπτιοι): by which this learned writer would insinuate, that it was not so much the name of a dog, as the qualities of that animal, to which the Egyptians alluded. Plutarch thought by this refinement to take off the impropriety of conferring so base a name upon a Deity. But the truth is, that the Egyptians neither bestowed it nominally; nor alluded to it in any degree. The title which they gave to Hermes was the same that they bestowed upon Hercules: they expressed it Cahen, and Cohen; and it was very properly represented above by the Greek term Χων, Chon. It is said of Socrates, that he sometimes made use of an
uncommon oath, μα τον κυνα, και τον χηνα by the dog and the goose: which at first does not seem consistent with the gravity of his character. But we are informed by Porphyry, that this was not done by way of ridicule: for Socrates esteemed it a very serious and religious mode of attestation: and under
these terms made a solemn appeal to the son of [82]Zeus. The purport of the words is obvious: and whatever hidden meaning there may have been, the oath was made ridiculous by the absurdity of the terms. Besides, what possible connection could there have subsisted between a dog and a Deity; a goose and the son of Jove? There was certainly none: yet Socrates, like the rest of his fraternity, having an antipathy to foreign terms, chose to represent his ideas through this false medium; by which means the very essence of his invocation was lost. The son of Zeus, to whom he appealed, was the Egyptian Cahen abovementioned; but this sacred title was idly changed to κυνα και χηνα, a dog and a goose, from a similitude in sound. That he referred to the Egyptian Deity, is manifest from Plato, who acknowledges
that he swore, [83]μα τον κυνα τον Αιγυπτιων θεον. By which we are to understand a Cahen of
Egypt. Porphyry expressly says, that it was the God Hermes the son of Zeus, and Maia: [84]Κατα τον του Διος και Μαιας παιδα εποιειτο τον ὁρκον.
I cannot account upon any other principle than that upon which I have proceeded, for the strange representation of Apollo, and Bacchus, gaping with open mouths. So it seems they were in some places described. Clemens of Alexandria mentions from Polemon, that Apollo was thus exhibited: [85]Πολεμων δε κεχηνοτος Απολλωνος οιδεν αγαλμα. And we are told that a gaping[86] Bacchus was particularly worshipped at Samos. They were both the same as the Egyptian Orus; who was styled Cahen-On, Rex, vel Deus Sol; out of which Cahen-On the Grecians seem to have formed the word Χαινων: and in consequence of it, these two Deities were represented with their jaws widely extended.
This term was sometimes changed to κοινος, communis: hence it is that we so often meet with κοινοι
Θεοι, and κοινοι βωμοι, upon coins and marbles: also κοινος Ἑρμης. And as Hermes was the
reputed God of gain, every thing found was adjudged to be κοινος, or common.



[87]Αλλ' εσιδουσα Εξαπινης, Ἑρμης κοινος, εφη θυγατηρ. [88]Κοινον ειναι τον Ἑρμην.
Notwithstanding this notion so universally received, yet among the Grecians themselves the term
κοινος was an antient title of eminence. [89]Κοινος, ὁ Δεσποτης. Coinos signifies a lord and master: undoubtedly from Cohinus; and that from Cohen. It would be endless to enumerate all the instances which might be brought of this nature. Of this, I think, I am assured, that whoever will consider the uncouth names both of Deities, and men, as well as of places, in the light recommended; and attend to the mythology transmitted concerning them; will be able by these helps to trace them to their original meaning. It is, I think, plain, that what the Grecians so often interpreted κυνες, was an antient Amonian title. When therefore I read of the brazen dog of Vulcan, of the dog of Erigone, of Orion, of Geryon, of Orus, of Hercules, of Amphilochus, of Hecate, I cannot but suppose, that they were the titles of so many Deities; or else of their priests, who were denominated from their office. In short, the Cahen of Egypt were no more dogs than the Pateræ of Amon were basons: and though Diodorus does say, that at the
grand celebrity of [90]Isis, the whole was preceded by dogs, yet I cannot help being persuaded that they were the priests of the Goddess.
By this clue we may unravel many intricate histories transmitted from different parts. In the temple of Vulcan, near mount Ætna, there are said to have been a breed of dogs, which fawned upon good men,
but were implacable to the bad. [91]Inde etiam perpetuus ignis a Siculis alebatur in Ætnæo Vulcani templo, cui custodes adhibiti sunt sacri canes, blandientes piis hominibus, in impios ferocientes. In the celebrated gardens of Electra there was a golden dog, which shewed the same regard to good men, and was as inveterate to others.
[92]Χρυσεος οιδαινοντι κυων συνυλακτεε λαιμῳ Σαινων ηθαδα φωτα.
What is more remarkable, there were many gaping dogs in this temple; which are represented as so many statues, yet were endowed with life.
[93]Χασμασι ποιητοισι σεσῃροτες ανθερεωνες Ψευδαλεων σκυλακων στιχες εμφρονες.
Homer describes something of the same nature in the gardens of Alcinous.
[94]Χρυσειοι δ' ἑκατερθε και αργυρεοι κυνες ησαν, Ὁυς Ἡφαιστος ετευξεν ιδυιῃσι πραπιδεσσιν, Αθανατους οντας, και αγηρως ηματα παντα.
All this relates to the Cusean priests of Vulcan or Hephaistos, and to the priesthood established in his temple: which priesthood was kept up by succession, and never became extinct. What was Cusean, the Greeks often rendered Χρυσειον, as I shall hereafter shew. The same people were also styled Cuthim; and this word likewise among the antients signified gold: from hence these priests were styled Χρυσειοι κυνες. We find the like history in Crete: here too was a golden dog, which Zeus had
appointed to be the guardian of his temple[95]. By comparing these histories, I think we cannot fail of arriving at the latent meaning. The God of light among other titles was styled Cahen, or Chan-Ades: but the term being taken in the same acceptation here, as in the instances above, the Deity was changed to a dog, and said to reside in the infernal regions. From hence he was supposed to have been dragged to light by Hercules of Thebes. The notion both of Cerberus and Hades being subterraneous Deities took its rise from the temples of old being situated near vast caverns, which were esteemed passages to the realms below. Such were in Messenia, in Argolis, in Bithynia, and at Enna in Sicily; not to mention divers other places. These temples were often named Kir-Abor; and the Deity Chan-Ades; out of which terms the Greeks formed Τον Κερβερον κυνα ἁδου; and fabled, that he was forced into upper air by Hercules, through these infernal inlets. And as temples similar in name and situation were built in various parts, the like history was told of them all. Pausanias takes notice of this event, among other
places, being ascribed to the cavern at [96]Tænarus; as well as to one at [97]Trœzen, and to a third near
the city [98]Hermione. The Poet Dionysius speaks of the feat being performed in the country of the Marianduni, near Colchis.
[99]Και Μαριανδυνων ἱερον πεδον, ενθ' ενεπουσιν Ουδαιου Κρονιδαο μεγαν κυνα Χαλκεοφωνον Χερσιν ανελκομενον μεγαλητορος Ἡρακληος,



Δεινον απο στοματων βαλεειν σιαλωδεα χυλον.
But however the Deity in all these instances may have been degraded to the regions of darkness, yet he was the God of light, Κυν-ἁδης; and such was the purport of that name. He was the same as Apollo, as
may be proved from the Cunidæ at Athens, who were a family set apart for his service. Κυννιδαι,
γενος Αθηνῃσιν, εξ ὁυ ὁ ἱερευς του Κυννιου Απολλωνος. Hesychius. The Cunnidai are a family at Athens, out of which the priest of Apollo Cunnius is chosen. He styles him Apollo Cunnius: but the Cunidai were more properly denominated from Apollo Cunides, the same as Cun-Ades. Poseidon was expressly styled Cun-Ades; and he was the same Deity as Apollo, only under a different title, as I have shewn. Κυναδης Ποσειδων Αθηνῃσιν ετιμᾳτο. Hesychius. Poseidon was worshipped at Athens under the title of Cun-Ades.
Though I have endeavoured to shew, that the term of which I have been treating was greatly misapplied, in being so uniformly referred to dogs, yet I do not mean to insinuate that it did not sometimes relate to
them. They were distinguished by this sacred title, and were held in some degree of [100]veneration; but
how far they were reverenced is not easy to determine. Herodotus,[101] speaking of the sanctity of some animals in Egypt, says, that the people in every family, where a dog died, shaved themselves all over:
and he mentions it as a custom still subsisting in his own time. Plutarch[102] differs from him. He allows that these animals were, at one time, esteemed holy; but it was before the time of Cambyses: from the æra of his reign they were held in another light: for when this king killed the sacred Apis, the dogs fed so liberally upon his entrails, without making a proper distinction, that they lost all their sanctity. It is of little consequence whichever account be the truest. They were certainly of old looked upon as sacred; and esteemed emblems of the Deity. And it was, perhaps, with a view to this, and to prevent the Israelites retaining any notion of this nature, that a dog was not suffered to come within the precincts of
the temple at [103]Jerusalem. In the Mosaic law, the price of a dog, and the hire of a harlot, are put upon
the same level. [104]Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow: for both these are an abomination to the Lord thy God.
To conclude: The Dog, in Egypt, was undoubtedly called Cahen, and Cohen; a title by which many other animals, and even vegetables, were honoured, on account of their being consecrated to some Deity. The Greeks did not consider that this was a borrowed appellation, which belonged to the Gods and their Priests; and was from them extended to many things held sacred. Hence they have continually referred this term to one object only: by which means they have misrepresented many curious pieces of history: and a number of idle fables have been devised to the disparagement of all that was true.
OF
CHUS;
STYLED
ΧΡYΣΟΣ ΧΡYΣΑΩΡ.
Among the different branches of the great Amonian family which spread themselves abroad, the sons of Chus were the most considerable, and at the same time the most enterprising. They got access into countries widely distant; where they may be traced under different denominations, but more particularly by their family title. This we might expect the Greeks to have rendered Chusos, and to have named the people Χυσαιοι, Chusæi. But, by a fatal misprision, they uniformly changed these terms to words more
familiar to their ear, and rendered them Χρυσος, and Χρυσειος, as if they had a reference to gold. I have before mentioned the various parts of the world where the Amonians settled, and especially this branch of that family. Their most considerable colonies westward were in Iönia and Hellas; and about Cuma and Liguria in Italy; and upon the coast of Iberia in Spain. They were likewise to be found in Cyrene; and still farther in Mauritania, and in the islands opposite to that coast. In the north they were to be met with at Colchis, towards the foot of Mount Caucasus, and in most regions upon the coast of the Euxine sea. In the histories of these countries the Grecians have constantly changed Chusos, the Gentile name, to Chrusos, Χρυσος; and Chus-Or, Chusorus, to Χρυσωρ, Chrusor: and, in consequence of this alteration, they have introduced in their accounts of these places some legend about gold. Hence we
read of a golden fleece at Colchis; golden apples at the Hesperides; at [105]Tartessus, a golden cup; and, at Cuma, in Campania, a golden branch:
Aureus et foliis, et lento vimine, ramus.



Something similar is observable in the history of Cyrene. The natives were not remarkable for either mines or merchandize: yet, Palæphatus, having mentioned that they were κατα γενος Αιθιοπες,
Ethiopians by extraction, that is, Cuseans, subjoins: [106]Εισι δε σφοδρα χρυσοι. Pindar, in celebrating each happy circumstance of the Insulæ Fortunatæ, mentions, that there were trees with
branches of gold: [107]Ανθεμα δε χρυσου φλεγει. The river Phasis, in Colchis, was supposed to have abounded with gold; and the like was pretended of the Hermus and Pactolus in Iönia. Not only the
Poets, but many of the graver [108]historians, speak of their golden sands. Yet there is reason to doubt of the fact: for not one of them produces any good voucher for what they suppose. They do not mention any trade carried on, nor riches accruing from this lucky circumstance: so that there is no reason to think that one grain of gold was gathered from these celebrated streams. Among the several islands occupied by this people were Rhodes and Delos. In the former, the chief city is said to have been blessed with
showers of gold. [109]Ενθα ποτε βρεχε θεον Βασιλευς ὁ μεγας χρυσαις νιφαδεσσι πολιν. At Delos every thing was golden, even the slippers of the God.
[110]Χρυσεα και τα πεδιλα, πολυχρυσος γαρ Απολλων.
And this not only in aftertimes, when the island was enriched with offerings from different nations, but even at the birth of the God; by which is meant the foundation of his temple, and introduction of his rites.
[111]Χρυσεα τοι τοτε παντα θεμειλια γεινατο, Δηλε, Χρυσῳ δε τροχοεσσα πανημερος εῤῥεε λιμνη, Χρυσειον δ' εκομισσε γενεθλιον ερνος ελαιης, Χρυσῳ δε πλημμυρε βαθυς Ινωπος ἑλιχθεις, Αυτη δε χρυσοιο απ' ουδεος ἑιλεο παιδα, Εν δ' εβαλευ κολποισιν.
We find that the very soil and foundations of the island were golden: the lake floated with golden waves: the olive tree vegetated with golden fruit: and the river Inopus, deep as it was, swelled with gold. Homer, in a hymn to the same personage, represents the whole more compendiously, by saying, that the island was weighed down with treasure:
[112]Χρυσῳ δ' αρα Δηλος ἁπασα Βεβριθει.
I have before mentioned that the Amonians settled in Liguria: and, in consequence of it, the Heliadæ are represented as weeping, not only amber, but gold. Philostratus, speaking of a particular species of fir
trees in Bœtica, says, that they dropped blood, just as the Heliadæ upon the Padus did[113] gold.
Chus, by the Egyptians and Canaanites, was styled Or-Chus, and[114] Chus-Or: the latter of which was expressed by the Greeks, analogous to the examples above, Χρυσωρ, Chrusor: and we learn in Eusebius, from Philo, that Chrusor was one of the principal Deities of the Phenicians, a great benefactor to mankind; and by some supposed to have been the same as Hephaistus. Both the Tyrians and Sidonians were undoubtedly a mixed race, and preserved the memory of Ham, and Chus, equally with that of Canaan.
This name, so often rendered Chrusos, and Chrusor, was sometimes changed to Χρυσαωρ, Chrusaor: and occurs in many places where the Cuthites were known to have settled. We have been shewn that they were a long time in Egypt; and we read of a Chrusaor in those parts, who is said to have arisen from the blood of Medusa.
[115]Εξεθορε Χρυσαωρ τε μεγας, και Πηγασος ἱππος.
We meet with the same Chrusaor in the regions of Asia Minor, especially among the Carians. In these parts he was particularly worshipped, and said to have been the first deified mortal. The great Divan of
that nation was called Chrusaorium; and there was a city [116]Chrusaoris, and a temple of the same name. [117]Εγγυς δε της πολεως το του Χρυσαορεως Διος κοινον ἁπαντων Καρων, εις ὁ συνιασι θυσαντες τε και βουλευσαμενοι. This city was properly called Chus-Or, and built in
memory of the same person; as the city Chusora, called also [118]Cerchusora, in Egypt. It was undoubtedly founded by some of the same family, who in aftertimes worshipped their chief ancestor; as the Sidonians and Syrians did likewise. For this we have the testimony of Sanchoniathon; who, having
mentioned the various benefits bestowed upon mankind by Chrusaor, says, at the conclusion, [119]Διο και ὡς θεον αυτον μετα θανατον εσεβασθησαν· for which reason, after his death, they



worshipped him as a God. The first king of Iberia was named Chrusaor, the reputed father of
[120]Geryon; and he is said to have been πολυχρυσος, a person of great wealth: all which is an Egyptian history, transferred from the Nile to the Bœtis.
[121]Χρυσαωρ δ' ετεκε τρικαρηνον Γηρυονηα, Μιχθεις Χαλλιροῃ κουρῃ κλυτου Ωκεανοιο.
Geryon of Spain was, according to this mythology of the poet, the son of Chrusaor; and Chrusaor was confessedly of Egyptian original: so that, whatever the fable may allude to, it must have been imported into Bœtica from Egypt by some of the sons of Chus. The Grecians borrowed this term, and applied it to Apollo; and from this epithet, Chrusaor, he was denominated the God of the golden sword. Homer
accordingly styles him, [122]Απολλωνα Χρυσαορα: and, speaking of Apollo's infancy, he says,
[123]Ουδ' αρ' Απολλωνα Χρυσαορα θησατο μητηρ: and Diana is termed [124]Αυτοκασιγνητη Χρυσαορος Απολλωνος.
This title cannot possibly relate to the implement supposed: for it would be idle to style an infant the God of the golden sword. It was a weapon, which at no time was ascribed to him: nor do I believe, that he is ever represented with one either upon a gem, or a marble. He is described as wishing for a harp, and for a bow.
[125]Ειη μοι κιθαρις τε φιλη, και καμπυλα τοξα.
And his mother is said to have been pleased that she produced him to the world an archer:
[126]Χαιρε δε Λετω, Ὁυνεκα τοξοφορον και καρτερον ὑιον ετικτεν.
These habiliments are often specified: but I do not recollect any mention made of a sword, nor was the term Chrusaor of Grecian etymology.
Since then we may be assured that Chus was the person alluded to under the name of Chrusos, Chrubor, and Chrusaor; we need not wonder that his substitute Apollo is so often styled Χρυσοκομης, and
Χρυσολυρος: that the harp, called by the Amonians [127] Chan-Or, and Cuth-Or, from the supposed
inventor, should by the Grecians be denominated Χρυσεα φορμιγξ [128]Απολλωνος: that so many cities, where Apollo was particularly worshipped, should be called Chruse, and Chrusopolis, the number
of which was of no small [129]amount. Nor is this observable in cities only, but in rivers, which were named in the same manner. For it was usual, in the first ages, to consecrate rivers to Deities, and to call them after their names. Hence many were denominated from Chusorus, which by the Greeks was changed to Χρυσοῤῥοας; and from this mistake they were supposed to abound with gold. The Nile was
called Chrusorrhoas[130], which had no pretensions to gold: and there was a river of this name at
[131]Damascus. Others too might be produced, none of which had any claim to that mineral. There was a
stream Chrusorrhoas near the Amazonian city Themiscura in [132]Pontus: and the river Pactolus was of
old so called, whence probably came the notion of its abounding with gold. [133]Πακτωλος ποταμος
εστι της Λυδιας——εκαλειτο δε προτερον Χρυσοῤῥοας. It was named Chrusorrhoas first, and in aftertimes Pactolus: whence we may conclude, in respect to gold, that the name was not given on account of any such circumstance; but the notion was inferred from the name.
It is apparent that this repeated mistake arose in great measure from the term Chusus and Chrusus being similar: whence the latter was easily convertible into the former; which to the Grecians appeared a more intelligible, and at the same time a more splendid, title. But there was still another obvious reason for this change. Chus was by many of the eastern nations expressed Cuth; and his posterity the Cuthim.
This term, in the antient Chaldäic, and other Amonian languages, signified [134]gold: hence many cities and countries, where the Cuthites settled, were described as golden, and were represented by the terms Chrusos and Chruse. These, as I have shewn, had no relation to gold, but to Chus, who was reverenced as the Sun, or Apollo; and was looked upon as Dionusus; but may more truly be esteemed Bacchus.
Hence, when the poet Dionysius mentions the island Chruse in [135]India, his commentator observes; Χρυση νησος, λεγομενη ὁυτως, η δια το χρυσον φερειν, η κατα τον Διονυσον· and at last concludes, [136]Χρυσους ειναι πως δοκει ὁ ἡλιος.
In a former dissertation concerning the Shepherd Kings in Egypt, I have shewn that they were the sons of Chus, who came into that country under the title of Auritæ. They settled in a province named from them Cushan, which was at the upper part of Delta; and in aftertimes called Nomos Arabicus. It was in
the vicinity of Memphis, and Aphroditopolis, which places they likewise [137]occupied. I have



mentioned that Chusos was often expressed Chrusos, and the country of the Cuthim rendered the golden country. If then there be that uniformity in error which I maintain, it may be expected that, in the history of these places, there should be some reference to gold. It is remarkable that all this part of Egypt, conformably to what I have said, was called Χρυση, Chruse. Here was the campus aureus, and Aphrodite Aurea of the Romans: and all the country about Memphis was styled golden. To this Diodorus, among others, bears witness: [138]Την τε Αφροδιτην ονομαζεσθαι παρα τοις εγχωριοις Χρυσην ΕΚ ΠΑΛΑΙΑΣ ΠΑΡΑΔΟΣΕΩΣ, και πεδιον ειναι καλουμενον Χρυσης Αφροδιτης περι την ονομαζομενην Μεμφιν. When the Cuthite shepherds came into Egypt, they
made Memphis the seat of royal [139]residence: and hard by was the nome of Aphrodite, and the Arabian nome, which they particularly possessed: and which, in consequence of it, were both styled the
regions of the Cuthim. Hence came the title of [140]Aphrodite Chruse: and hence the country had the name of the Golden District. The island at the point of Delta, where stood the city Cercusora, is called
Gieserat [141]Eddahib, or the Golden Island, at this day. Diodorus mentions, that this appellation of Chruse was derived from a very antient tradition. This tradition undoubtedly related to the shepherds, those sons of Chus, who were so long in possession of the country; and whose history was of the highest antiquity.
The Cuthites in the west occupied only some particular spots: but from Babylonia eastward the greatest part of that extensive sea-coast seems to have been in their possession. In the history of these parts, there is often some allusion to gold, as may be seen in the island Chruse, above-mentioned; and in the Chersonesus Aurea, which lay beyond the Ganges: and not only of gold, but sometimes a reference to brass; and this from a similar mistake. For as Chusus was changed to Chrusus, Χρυσος, gold; so was
Cal-Chus, the hill, or place of Chus, converted to Chalcus, Χαλκος, brass. Colchis was properly ColChus; and therefore called also Cuta, and Cutaia. But what was Colchian being sometimes rendered Chalcion, Καλκιον, gave rise to the fable of brazen bulls; which were only Colchic Tor, or towers.
There was a region named Colchis in [142]India: for where the Cuthites settled, they continually kept up the memory of their forefathers, and called places by their names. This being a secret to Philostratus, has led him into a deal of mysterious error. It is well known that this people were styled Oreitæ, and
Auritæ, both in Egypt and in other parts. Philostratus says that [143]Apollonius came to a settlement of the Oreitæ upon the Indian Ocean. He also visited their Pegadæ; and, what is remarkable, he met with a people whose very rocks were brazen; their sand was brazen: the rivers conveyed down their streams fine filaments of brass: and the natives esteemed their land golden on account of the plenty of brass. Now what is this detail, but an abuse of terms, ill understood, and shamefully misapplied? Philostratus had heard of a region in India; the history of which he would fain render marvellous. The country, whither Apollonius is supposed to go, was a province of the Indo-Cuthites, who were to be met with in various parts under the title of Oreitæ. They were worshippers of fire, and came originally from the land of Ur; and hence had that name. The Pegadæ of the country are what we now call Pagodas; and which are too well known to need describing. There were in this part of the world several cities, and temples, dedicated to the memory of Chus. Some of these are famous at this day, though denominated after the Babylonish dialect Cutha, and Cuta; witness Calcutta, and Calecut. The latter seems to have been the capital of the region called of old Colchis. This was more truly expressed Cal-Chus; which Philostratus
has mistaken for Χαλκος, brass; and made the very [144]rocks and rivers abound with that mineral. And yet, that the old mistake about gold may not be omitted, he concludes with a strange antithesis, by
saying, that the natives esteemed their country Chrusitis, or golden, from the quantity of [145]brass.
It has been my endeavour to prove that what the Grecians represented by Chrusos, Chrusor, and Chrusaor, should have been expressed Chus, Chusos, and Chusor, called also Chus-Orus. Chus was the son of Ham; and though the names of the Grecian Deities are not uniformly appropriated, yet Ham is generally looked upon as Ἑλιος, the Sun; and had the title Dis, and Dios: hence the city of Amon in Egypt was rendered Diospolis. If then Chrusos, and Chrusor, be, as I have supposed, Chus; the person so denominated must have been, according to the more antient mythology, the son of Helius, and Dios.
We find accordingly that it was so. The Scholiast upon Pindar expressly says, [146]Διος παις ὁ
Χρυσος. And in another place he is said to have been the offspring of Helius, who was no other than
Cham. [147]Εκ θειας και Ὑπεριονος Ἡλιος, εκ δε Ἡλιου ὁ Χρυσος. Magic and incantations are attributed to Chus, as the inventor; and they were certainly first practised among his sons: hence it is
said by Sanchoniathon, [148]Τον Χρυσωρ λογους ασκησαι και επῳδας, και μαντειας. He was however esteemed a great benefactor; and many salutary inventions were ascribed to him. He had
particularly the credit of being the first who ventured upon the seas: [149]Πρωτον τε παντων
ανθρωπων πλευσαι. Whether this can be said truly of Chus himself, is uncertain: it agrees full well with the history of his sons; who, as we have the greatest reason to be assured, were the first great navigators in the world.



OF
CANAAN, CNAAN,
AND
ΧΝΑΣ;
AND OF THE
ΚΥΚΝΟΣ.
Lucian tells us, that, reflecting upon the account given of Phaëthon, who fell thunderstruck into the Eridanus, and of his sisters, who were changed to poplars weeping amber, he took a resolution, if he should ever be near the scene of these wonderful transactions, to inquire among the natives concerning
the truth of the [150]story. It so happened, that, at a certain time, he was obliged to go up the river above mentioned: and he says, that he looked about very wistfully; yet, to his great amazement, he saw neither amber nor poplar. Upon this he took the liberty to ask the people, who rowed him, when he should arrive at the amber-dropping trees: but it was with some difficulty that he could make them understand what he meant. He then explained to them the story of Phaëthon: how he borrowed the chariot of the Sun; and being an awkward charioteer, tumbled headlong into the Eridanus: that his sisters pined away with grief; and at last were transformed to trees, the same of which he had just spoken: and he assured them, that these trees were to be found somewhere upon the banks, weeping amber. Who the deuce, says one of the boatmen, could tell you such an idle story? We never heard of any charioteer tumbling into the river; nor have we, that I know of, a single poplar in the country. If there were any trees hereabouts dropping amber, do you think, master, that we would sit here, day after day, tugging against stream for a dry groat, when we might step ashore, and make our fortunes so easily? This affected Lucian a good deal: for he had formed some hopes of obtaining a little of this precious commodity; and began to think that he must have been imposed upon. However, as Cycnus, the brother of Phaëthon, was here changed to a swan, he took it for granted that he should find a number of those birds sailing up and down the stream, and making the groves echo with their melody. But not perceiving any in a great space, he took the liberty, as he passed onward, to put the question again to the boatmen; and to make inquiry about these birds. Pray, gentlemen, says he, at what particular season is it that your swans hereabouts sing so sweetly? It is said, that they were formerly men, and always at Apollo's side; being in a manner of his privy council. Their skill in music must have been very great: and though they have been changed into birds, they retain that faculty, and, I am told, sing most melodiously. The watermen could not help smiling at this account. Why, sir, says one of them, what strange stories you have picked up about our country, and this river? We have plied here, men and boys, for years; and to be sure we cannot say that we never saw a swan: there are some here and there towards the fens, which make a low dull noise: but as for any harmony, a rook or a jackdaw, in comparison of them, may be looked upon as a nightingale.
Such are the witty strictures of Lucian upon the story of Phaëthon and Cycnus, as described by the poets. Whatever may have been the grounds upon which this fiction is founded, they were certainly unknown to the Greeks; who have misinterpreted what little came to their hands, and from such misconstruction devised these fables. The story, as we have it, is not uniformly told. Some, like Lucian, speak of swans in the plural; and suppose them to have been the ministers, and attendants of Apollo, who assisted at his concerts. Others mention one person only, called Cycnus; who was the reputed brother of Phaëthon, and at his death was transformed to the bird of that name. The fable is the same whichever way it may be related, and the purport of it is likewise the same. There is one mistake in the story, which I must set right before I proceed; as it may be of some consequence in the process of my
inquiry. Phaëthon is represented by many of the poets as the offspring of the Sun, or Apollo: [151]Sole satus Phaëthon. But this was a mistake, and to be found chiefly among the Roman poets. Phaëthon was the Sun. It was a title of Apollo; and was given to him as the God of light. This is manifest from the testimony of the more early Greek poets, and particularly from Homer, who uses it in this acceptation.
[152]Ουδεποτ' αυτους Ηελιος Φαεθον επιδερκεται ακτινεσσιν.
In respect to Cycnus and his brotherhood, those vocal ministers of Apollo, the story, which is told of them, undoubtedly alludes to Canaan, the son of Ham; and to the Canaanites, his posterity. They sent out many colonies; which colonies, there is great reason to think, settled in those places, where these legends about swans particularly prevailed. The name of Canaan was by different nations greatly varied, and ill expressed: and this misconstruction among the Greeks gave rise to the fable. To shew this, it will be proper to give an account of the rites and customs of the Canaanites, as well as of their extensive traffic. Among the many branches of the Amonian family, which settled in various parts of the world,



and carried on an early correspondence, the Canaanites were not the least respectable. They traded from Sidon chiefly, before that city was taken by the king of Ascalon: and upon their commerce being
interrupted here, they [153]removed it to the strong hold of Tyre. This place was soon improved to a mighty city, which was very memorable in its day. The Canaanites, as they were a sister tribe of the Mizraïm, so were they extremely like them in their rites and religion. They held a heifer, or cow, in high
veneration, agreeably with the [154]customs of Egypt. Their chief Deity was the Sun, whom they worshipped together with the Baalim, under the titles Ourchol, Adonis, Thamuz. It was a custom among the Grecians, at the celebration of their religious festivals, to crown the whole with hymns of praise, and the most joyful exclamations. But the Egyptians were of a gloomy turn of mind, which infected the whole of their worship. Their hymns were always composed in melancholy affecting airs, and consisted of lamentations for the loss of Osiris, the mystic flight of Bacchus, the wanderings of Isis, and the sufferings of the Gods. Apuleius takes notice of this difference in the rites and worship of the two
nations: [155]Ægyptiaca numinum fana plena plangoribus: Græca plerumque choreis. Hence the author of the Orphic Argonautica, speaking of the initiations in Egypt, mentions,
[156]Θρενους τ' Αιγυπτιον, και Οσιριδος ἱερα χυτλα.
The Canaanites at Byblus, Berytus, Sidon, and afterwards at Tyre, used particularly mournful dirges for the loss of Adonis, or Thamuz; who was the same as Thamas, and Osiris in Egypt. The Cretans had the like mournful hymns, in which they commemorated the grief of Apollo for the loss of Atymnius.
[157]Αιλινα μελπειν, Ὁια παρα Κρητεσσιν αναξ ελιγαινεν Απολλων Δακρυχεων ερατεινον Ατυμνιον.
The measures and harmony of the Canaanites seem to have been very affecting, and to have made a wonderful impression on the minds of their audience. The infectious mode of worship prevailed so far,
that the children of Israel were forbidden to weep, and make lamentation upon a festival: [158]Ειναι γαρ ἑορτην, και μη δειν εν αυτῃ κλαιειν, ου γαρ εξειναι. And Nehemiah gives the people a
caution to the same purpose: [159]This day is holy unto the Lord your God: mourn not, nor weep. And
Esdras counsels them in the same manner: [160]This day is holy unto the Lord: be not sorrowful. It is
likewise in another place mentioned, that [161]the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy: neither be ye grieved. Such was the prohibition given to the Israelites: but among the
Canaanites this shew of sorrow was encouraged, and made part of their [162]rites.
The father of this people is represented in the Mosaic history, according to our version, Canaan: but there is reason to think that by the Egyptians and other neighbouring nations it was expressed Cnaan.
This by the Greeks was rendered Χναας, and Χνας; and in later times Χνα, Cna. [163]Χνα, ὁυτος ἡ
Φοινικη εκαλειτο—το εθνικον Χναος. We are told by Philo from Sanchoniathon, that [164]Isiris the Egyptian, who found out three letters, was the brother of Cna: by which is meant, that Mizraïm was the brother of Canaan. I have taken notice more than once of a particular term, Υκ, Uc; which has been passed over unnoticed by most writers: yet is to be found in the composition of many words; especially such as are of Amonian original. The tribe of Cush was styled by Manethon, before the passage was
depraved, Υκκουσος. Uch, says this author, in the sacred language of Egypt, signifies a [165]king. Hence it was conferred as a title upon the God Sehor, who, as we may infer from Manethon and
[166]Hellanicus, was called Ucsiris, and Icsiris; but by the later Greeks the name was altered to Isiris and Osiris. And not only the God Sehor, or Sehoris was so expressed; but Cnas, or Canaan, had the same title, and was styled Uc-Cnas, and the Gentile name or possessive was Uc-cnaos, Υκ-κναος: το
εθνικον γαρ Χναος, as we learn from Stephanus. The Greeks, whose custom it was to reduce every
foreign name to something similar in their own language, changed Υκκναος to Κυκνειος, Uc Cnaus
to Cucneus; and from Υκ Κνας formed Κυκνος. Some traces of this word still remain, though almost effaced; and may be observed in the name of the Goddess Ichnaia. Instead of Uc-Cnaan the son of Ham, the Greeks have substituted this personage in the feminine, whom they have represented as the daughter
of the Sun. She is mentioned in this light by Lycophron: [167]Της Ἡλιου θυγατρος Ιχναιας
βραβευς. They likewise changed Thamuz and Thamas of Canaan and Egypt to Themis a feminine; and called her Ichnaia Themis. She is so styled by Homer.
[168]Θεαι δ' εσαν ενδοθι πασαι, Ὁσσαι αρισται εσαν, Διωνη τε, Ῥειη τε, Ιχναιη τε Θεμις, και αγαστονος Αμφιτριτη.
Ιχναια is here used adjectively. Ιχναια Θεμις signifies Themis, or Thamuz, of [169]Canaan.



There was another circumstance, which probably assisted to carry on the mistake: a Canaanitish temple
was called both Ca-Cnas, and Cu-Cnas; and adjectively[170] Cu-Cnaios; which terms there is reason to think were rendered Κυκνος, and Κυκνειος. Besides all this, the swan was undoubtedly the insigne of Canaan, as the eagle and vulture were of Egypt, and the dove of Babylonia. It was certainly the hieroglyphic of the country. These were the causes which contributed to the framing many idle legends, such as the poets improved upon greatly. Hence it is observable, that wherever we may imagine any colonies from Canaan to have settled and to have founded temples, there is some story about swans: and the Greeks, in alluding to their hymns, instead of Yκκναον ασμα, the music of Canaan, have
introduced κυκνειον ασμα, the singing of these birds: and, instead of the death of Thamuz, lamented by the Cucnaans, or priests, they have made the swans sing their own dirge, and foretell their own funeral. Wherever the Canaanites came, they introduced their national worship; part of which, as I have shewn, consisted in chanting hymns to the honour of their country God. He was the same as Apollo of Greece: on which account, Lucian, in compliance with the current notion, says, that the Cycni were formerly the assessors and ministers of that Deity. By this we are to understand, that people of this denomination were in antient times his priests. One part of the world, where this notion about swans prevailed, was in Liguria, upon the banks of the Eridanus. Here Phaëthon was supposed to have met with his downfal; and here his brother Cycnus underwent the metamorphosis, of which we have spoken. In these parts some Amonians settled very early; among whom it appears that there were many from Canaan. They may be traced by the mighty works which they carried on; for they drained the river towards its mouth, and formed some vast canals, called Fossæ Philistinæ. Pliny, speaking of the
entrance into the Eridanus, says, [171]Indé ostia plana, Carbonaria, ac fossiones Philistinæ, quod alii Tartarum vocant: omnia ex Philistinæ fossæ abundatione nascentia. These canals were, undoubtedly the work of the Canaanites, and particularly of some of the Caphtorim, who came from Philistim: and hence these outlets of the river were named Philistinæ. The river betrays its original in its name; for it has no relation to the Celtic language, but is apparently of Egyptian or Canaanitish etymology. This is manifest from the terms of which it is made up; for it is compounded of Ur-Adon, sive Orus Adonis; and was sacred to the God of that name. The river, simply, and out of composition, was Adon, or Adonis: and it is to be observed, that this is the name of one of the principal rivers in Canaan. It ran near the city Biblus, where the death of Thamuz was particularly lamented. It is a circumstance taken notice of by many authors, and most pathetically described by Milton.
[172]Thammuz came next behind, Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd The Syrian damsels to lament his fate In amorous ditties all a summer's day: While smooth Adonis from his native rock Ran purple to the sea; suppos'd with blood Of Thammuz yearly wounded.
It is said that the Eridanus was so called first by [173]Pherecydes Syrus: and that my etymology is true,
may in great measure be proved from the [174]Scholiast upon Aratus. He shews that the name was of Egyptian original, at least consonant to the language of Egypt; for it was the same as the Nile. It is certain that it occurred in the antient sphere of Egypt, whence the Grecians received it. The great effusion of water in the celestial sphere, which, Aratus says, was the Nile, is still called the Eridanus: and, as the name was of oriental original, the purport of it must be looked for among the people of those parts. The river Strymon, in Thrace, was supposed to abound with swans, as much as the Eridanus; and the antient name of this river was Palaestinus. It was so called from the Amonians, who settled here under the name of Adonians, and who founded the city Adonis. They were by the later Greeks styled,
after the Iönic manner, Edonians, and their city Edonis. [175]Στρυμων ποταμος εστι της Θρακης
κατα πολιν Ηδωνιδα, προσηγορευετο δε προτερον Παλαιστινος. The Strymon is a river of Thrace, which runs by the city Edonis: it was of old called the river Palæstinus. In these places, and in all others where any of the Canaanites settled, the Grecians have introduced some story about swans.
Some of them seem to have gained access at Delphi; as did likewise others from Egypt: and by such was that oracle first founded. Egypt, among other names, was called Ait, and Ai Ait, by the Greeks
expressed Αετια: [176]Εκληθη δε—και ΑΕΤΙΑ. The natives, in consequence of it, were called
Αετιοι, and Αεται; which was interpreted eagles. Hence, we are told by Plutarch, that some of the feathered kind, either eagles or swans, came from the remote parts of the earth, and settled at Delphi. [177]Αετους τινας, η Κυκνους, ω Τερεντιανε Πρισκε, μυθολογουσιν απο των ακρων της γης επι το μεσον φερομενους εις ταυτο συμπεσειν Πυθοι περι τον καλουμενον ομφαλον. These eagles and swans undoubtedly relate to colonies from Egypt and Canaan. I recollect but one philosopher styled Cygnus; and, what is remarkable, he was of Canaan. Antiochus, the Academic,
mentioned by Cicero in his philosophical works, and also by [178]Strabo, was of Ascaloun, in Palestine;



and he was surnamed Cygnus, the Swan: which name, as it is so circumstanced, must, I think, necessarily allude to this country.
As in early times colonies went by the name of the Deity whom they worshipped, or by the name of the insigne and hieroglyphic under which their country was denoted, every depredation made by such people was placed to the account of the Deity under such a device. This was the manner in which poets described things: and, in those days, all wrote in measure. Hence, instead of saying that the Egyptians, or Canaanites, or Tyrians, landed and carried off such and such persons; they said, that it was done by Jupiter, in the shape of an eagle, or a swan, or a bull: substituting an eagle for Egypt, a swan for Canaan,
and a bull for the city of [179]Tyre. It is said of the Telchines, who were Amonian priests, that they came to Attica under the conduct of Jupiter in the shape of an eagle.
[180]Αιετος ἡγεμονευε δι αιθερος αντιτυπος Ζευς.
By which is meant, that they were Egyptian priests; and an eagle was probably the device in their standard, as well as the insigne of their nation.
Some of the same family were to be found among the Atlantes of Mauritania, and are represented as having the shape of swans. Prometheus, in Æschylus, speaks of them in the commission which he gives
to Io: [181]You must go, says he, as far as the city Cisthene in the Gorgonian plains, where the three Phorcides reside; those antient, venerable ladies, who are in the shape of swans, and have but one eye, of which they make use in common. This history relates to an Amonian temple founded in the extreme parts of Africa; in which there were three priestesses of Canaanitish race; who, on that account, are said to be in the shape of swans. The notion of their having but one eye among them took its rise from an hieroglyphic very common in Egypt, and probably in Canaan: this was the representation of an eye,
which was said to be engraved upon the pediment of their [182]temples. As the land of Canaan lay so opportunely for traffic, and the emigrants from most parts went under their conduct, their history was well known. They navigated the seas very early, and were necessarily acquainted with foreign regions; to which they must at one time have betaken themselves in great numbers, when they fled before the sons of Israel. In all the places where they settled they were famous for their hymns and music; all which the Greeks have transferred to birds, and supposed that they were swans who were gifted with this harmony. Yet, sweet as their notes are said to have been, there is not, I believe, a person upon record who was ever a witness to it. It is, certainly, all a fable. When, therefore, Plutarch tells us that Apollo
was pleased with the music of swans, [183]μουσικῃ τε ἡδεται, και κυκνων φωναις; and when Æschylus mentions their singing their own dirges; they certainly allude to Egyptian and Canaanitish priests, who lamented the death of Adon and Osiris. And this could not be entirely a secret to the Grecians, for they seem often to refer to some such notion. Socrates termed swans his fellow-servants: in doing which he alluded to the antient priests, styled Cycni. They were people of the choir, and officiated in the temples of the same Deities; whose servant he professed himself to be. Hence Porphyry
assures us, [184]Ὁυ παιζων ὁμοδουλους αυτου ελεγεν τους κυκνους (Σοκρατης), that Socrates was very serious when he mentioned swans as his fellow-servants. When, therefore, Aristophanes
speaks of the [185]Delian and Pythian swans, they are the priests of those places, to whom he alludes. And when it is said by Plato, that the soul of Orpheus, out of disgust to womankind, led the life of a
[186]swan, the meaning certainly is, that he retired from the world to some cloister, and lived a life of celibacy, like a priest. For the priests of many countries, but particularly of Egypt, were recluses, and
devoted themselves to [187]celibacy: hence monkery came originally from Egypt. Lycophron, who was of Egypt, and skilled in antient terms, styles Calchas, who was the priest of Apollo, a swan.
[188]Μολοσσου κυπεως κοιτου κυκνον. These epithets, the Scholiast tells us, belong to Apollo; and
Calchas is called a swan, δια το γηραιον, και μαντικον: because he was an old prophet and priest. Hence, at the first institution of the rites of Apollo, which is termed the birth of the Deity, at Delos, it is said that many swans came from the coast of Asia, and went round the island for the space of seven days.
[189]Κυκνοι δε θεου μελποντες αοιδοι Μηονιον Πακτωλον εκυκλωσαντο λιποντες Ἑβδομακις περι Δηλον· επηεισαν δε λοχειῃ Μουσαων ορνιθες, αοιδοτατοι πετεηνων.
The whole of this relates to a choir of priests, who came over to settle at Delos, and to serve in the newly erected temple. They circled the island seven times; because seven, of old, was looked upon as a mysterious and sacred number.
[190]Ἑβδομη ειν αγαθοις, και ἑβδομη εστι γενεθλη. Ἑβδομη εν πρωτοισι, και ἑβδομη εστι τελειη.



Ἑβδοματῃ δη ὁι τετελεσμενα παντα τετυκται. Ἑπτα δε παντα τετυκται εν ουρανῳ αστεροεντι.
The birds in the island of Diomedes, which were said to have been originally companions of that hero, were undoubtedly priests, and of the same race as those of whom I have been treating. They are represented as gentle to good men, and averse to those who are bad. Ovid describes their shape and
appearance: [191]Ut non cygnorum, sic albis proxima cygnis; which, after what has been said, may, I think, be easily understood.
If then the harmony of swans, when spoken of, not only related to something quite foreign, but in reality did not of itself exist, it may appear wonderful that the antients should so universally give into the
notion. For not only the poets, but [192]Plato, Plutarch, Cicero, Pliny, with many others of high rank, speak of it as a circumstance well known. But it is to be observed, that none of them speak from their own experience: nor are they by any means consistent in what they say. Some mention this singing as a general faculty; which was exerted at all times: others limit it to particular seasons, and to particular
places. Aristotle seems to confine it to the seas of [193]Africa: [194]Aldrovandus says, that it may be heard upon the Thames near London. The account given by Aristotle is very remarkable. He says, that mariners, whose course lay through the Libyan sea, have often met with swans, and heard them singing in a melancholy strain: and upon a nearer approach, they could perceive that some of them were dying, from whom the harmony proceeded. Who would have expected to have found swans swimming in the salt sea, in the midst of the Mediterranean? There is nothing that a Grecian would not devise in support of a favourite error. The legend from beginning to end is groundless: and though most speak of the
music of swans as exquisite; yet some absolutely deny [195]the whole of it; and others are more moderate in their commendations. The watermen in Lucian give the preference to a jackdaw: but Antipater in some degree dissents, and thinks that the swan has the advantage.
[196]Λωιτερος κυκνων μικρος θροος, ηε κολοιων Κρωγμος.
And Lucretius confesses, that the screaming of a crane is not quite so pleasing:
[197]Parvus ut est, Cygni melior canor, ille gruum quam Clamor:
Which however is paying them no great compliment. To these respectable personages I must add the evidence of a modern; one too of no small repute, even the great Scaliger. He says, that he made a strict
scrutiny about this affair, when in Italy; and the result of his observations was this: [198]Ferrariæ multos (cygnos) vidimus, sed cantores sane malos, neque melius ansere canere.
OF
TEMPLE SCIENCE.
The Egyptians were very famous for geometrical knowledge: and as all the flat part of their country was annually overflowed, it is reasonable to suppose that they made use of this science to determine their lands, and to make out their several claims, at the retreat of the waters. Many indeed have thought, that
the confusion of property, which must for a while have prevailed, gave birth to practical [199]geometry, in order to remedy the evil: and in consequence of it, that charts and maps were first delineated in this country. These, we may imagine, did not relate only to private demesnes: but included also the course of the Nile in its various branches; and all the sea coast, and its inlets, with which lower Egypt was bounded.
It is very certain, that the people of Colchis, who were a colony from Egypt, had charts of this sort, with written descriptions of the seas and shores, whithersoever they traded: and they at one time carried on a
most extensive commerce. We are told, says the [200]Scholiast upon Apollonius, that the Colchians still retain the laws and customs of their forefathers: and they have pillars of stone, upon which are engraved maps of the continent, and of the ocean: Εισι δε, φησι, και νομοι παρ' αυτοις των Προγωνον, και Στηλαι, εν ἁις γης και θαλασσης αναγραφαι εισι. The poet, upon whom the above writer has commented, calls these pillars, κυρβεις: which, we are told, were of a square figure, like obelisks: and on these, he says, were delineated all the passages of the sea; and the boundaries of every country upon the earth.



[201]Ὁι δη τοι γραπτας πατερων ἑθεν ειρυονται Κυρβεας, ὁις ενι πασαι ὁδοι, και πειρατ' εασιν Ὑγρης τε, τραφερης τε, περιξ επινεισσομενοισιν.
These delineations had been made of old, and transmitted to the Colchians by their forefathers; which
forefathers were from [202]Egypt.
If then the Colchians had this science, we may presume that their mother country possessed it in as eminent a degree: and we are assured, that they were very knowing in this article. Clemens
Alexandrinus [203]mentions, that there were maps of Egypt, and charts of the Nile very early. And we are moreover told, that Sesostris (by which is meant the Sethosians) drew upon boards schemes of all
the countries, which he had traversed: and copies of these were given both to [204]the Egyptians, and to the Scythians, who held them in high estimation. This is a curious account of the first delineation of
countries, and origin of maps; which were first described upon [205]pillars. We may from hence be enabled to solve the enigma concerning Atlas, who is said to have supported the heavens upon his shoulders. This took its rise from some verses in Homer, which have been strangely misconstrued. The passage is in the Odyssey; where the poet is speaking of Calypso, who is said to be the daughter of Atlas, ολοοφρονος, a person of deep and recondite knowledge:
[206]Ατλαντος θυγατηρ ολοοφρονος, ὁστε θαλασσης Πασης βενθεα οιδεν, εχει δε τε ΚΙΟΝΑΣ αυτος Μακρας, ἁι Γαιαν τε και Ουρανον αμφις εχουσιν.
It is to be observed, that when the antients speak of the feats of Hercules, we are to understand the Herculeans; under the name of Cadmus is meant the Cadmians; under that of Atlas, the Atlantians. With
this allowance how plain are the words of Homer! The [207]Atlantians settled in Phrygia and Mauritania; and, like the Colchians, were of the family of Ham. They had great experience in sea affairs: and the poet tells us, that they knew all the soundings in the great deep.
Εχει δε τε Κιονας αυτος Μακρας, ἁι Γαιην τε και Ουρανον αμφις εχουσιν.
They had also long pillars, or obelisks, which referred to the sea; and upon which was delineated the whole system both of heaven and earth; αμφις, all around, both on the front of the obelisk, and on the
other sides. Κιονες Κοσμου were certainly maps, and histories of the universe; in the knowledge of which the Atlantians seem to have instructed their brethren the Herculeans. The Grecians, in their accounts, by putting one person for a people, have rendered the history obscure; which otherwise would be very intelligible. There is a passage in Eusebius, which may be rendered very plain, and to the
purpose, if we make use of the clue above-mentioned. [208]Ἡροδοτος δε λεγει τον Ηρακλεα μαντιν και φυσικον γενομενον παρα Ατλαντος του Βαρβαρου του Φρυγος διαδεχεσθαι τας του Κοσμου Κιονας. This may be paraphrased in the following manner; and with such latitude will be found perfectly consonant to the truth. The Herculeans were a people much given to divination, and to the study of nature. Great part of their knowledge they are thought to have had transmitted to them from those Atlantians, who settled in Phrygia, especially the history of the earth and heavens; for all such knowledge the Atlantians had of old consigned to pillars and obelisks in that country: and from them it was derived to the Herculeans, or Heraclidæ, of Greece. The Atlantians were esteemed by the Grecians as barbarous: but they were in reality of the same family. Their chief ancestor was the father of the Peleiadæ, or Ionim; of whom I shall hereafter have much to say: and was the supposed brother of Saturn. The Hellenes, though they did not always allow it, were undoubtedly of his race. This may be proved from Diodorus Siculus, who gives this curious history of the Peleiadæ, his offspring. [209]Ταυτας δε μιγεισας τοις ευφυεστατοις Ἡρωσι και Θεοις αρχηγους καταστηναι του πλειστου γενους τον ανθρωπων, τεκουσας τους δι' αρετην Θεους και Ἡρωας ονομασθεντας.—Παραπλησεως δε και τας αλλας Ατλαντιδας γεννησαι παιδας επιφανεις, ὡν τους μεν εθνων, τους δε πολεων γενεσθαι κτιστας· διοπερ ου μονον παρ' ενιοις των Βαρβαρων, αλλα και παρα τοις Ἑλλησι τους πλειστους των αρχαιοτατων Ἡρωων εις ταυτας αναφερειν το γενος. These daughters of Atlas, by their connections and marriages with the most illustrious heroes, and divinities, may be looked up to as the heads of most families upon earth. And from them proceeded all those, who upon account of their eminence were in aftertimes esteemed Gods and Heroes. And having spoken of Maia, and her offspring, the author proceeds to tell us, that the other Atlantides in like manner gave birth to a most noble race: some of whom were the founders of nations; and others the builders of cities: insomuch that most of the more antient heroes, not only of those abroad, who were esteemed Barbari, but even of the Helladians,



claimed their ancestry from them. And they received not only their ancestry, but their knowledge also, του κοσμου κιονας; all the celestial and terrestrial phenomena, which had been entrusted to the sacred
pillars of the Atlantes, ἁι γαιην τε και ουρανον αμφις εχουσιν, which contained descriptions both of the heavens, and the earth. From Phrygia they came at last to Hellas, where they were introduced by
Anaximander, who is said, [210]Εσδουναι πρωτον γεωγραφικον πινακα, to have been the first who
introduced a geographical chart: or, as Laertius expresses it, [211]Γης και Θαλαττης περιμετρον, the circumference of the terraqueous globe delineated.
Though the origin of maps may be deduced from Egypt, yet they were not the native Egyptians, by whom they were first constructed. Delineations of this nature were the contrivance of the Cuthites, or Shepherds. They were, among other titles, styled Saïtæ; and from them both astronomy and geometry were introduced in those parts. They, with immense labour, drained the lower provinces; erected stupendous buildings; and raised towers at the mouths of the river, which were opportunely situated for navigation. For, though the Mizraim were not addicted to commerce, yet it was followed by other families besides the Cuthites, who occupied the lower provinces towards the sea. The towers which were there raised served for lighthouses, and were, at the same time, temples, denominated from some title of the Deity, such as Canoph, Caneph, Cneph; also Perses, Proteus, Phanes, and Canobus. They were on both accounts much resorted to by mariners, and enriched with offerings. Here were deposited charts of the coast, and of the navigation of the Nile, which were engraved on pillars, and in aftertimes sketched out upon the Nilotic Papyrus. There is likewise reason to think that they were sometimes delineated upon walls. This leads me to take notice of a passage from Pherecydes Syrus, which seems to allude to something of this nature: though, I believe, in his short detail that he has misrepresented the
author from whom he copied. He is said, by Theopompus, [212]πρωτον περι της φυσεως, και Θεων,
Ἑλλησι γραφειν, to have been the first who wrote for the benefit of his countrymen about nature and
the Gods. Suidas [213]mentions, that he composed a theogony; all which knowledge, we are assured,
came from Egypt. It is certain that he studied in that[214] country; whence we may conclude, that the following history is Egyptian. He says, that Zas, or Jupiter, composed a large and curious robe, upon
which he described the earth, and the ocean, and the habitations upon the ocean. [215]Ζας ποιει φαρος
μεγα τε, και καλον, και εν αυτῳ ποικιλλει Γην, και Ωγηνον, και τα Ωγηνου δωματα. Now, Zas, or, as it should be rendered, Zan, was the Dorian title of Amon. And Ogenus, the Ocean, was the
most antient name of the Nile; whence the Grecians borrowed their Oceanus. [216]Ὁι γαρ Αιγυπτιοι
νομιζουσιν ωκεανον ειναι τον παρ' αυτοις ποταμον Νειλον. The Egyptians, by the term Oceanus, understand their own river Nilus. The same author, in another place, calls this river Oceames[217]. Τον δε ποταμον αρχαιοτατον μεν ονομα σχειν Ωκεαμην, ὁς εστιν Ἑλλενιστι ωκεανος. The former term, Ogenus, whence the Greeks borrowed their Oceanus, was a compound of Oc-Gehon, and Avas originally rendered Ogehonus. It signifies the noble Gehon, and is a name taken from one of the rivers of Paradise. The Nile was sometimes called simply Gehon, as we learn from the author of the Chronicon Paschale. [218]Εχει δε (ἡ Αιγυπτος) ποταμον Γηων—Νειλον καλουμενον. It was probably a name given by the Cuthites, from whom, as will be hereafter shewn,
the river Indus had the name of Phison. [219]Ποταμοι ονομαστοι Ινδος, ὁ και Φεισων, Νειλος, ὁ και Γηων. The two most celebrated rivers are the Indus, the same as the Phison, and the Nile, which is called the Gehon. The river, also, of Colchis, rendered Phasis, and Phasin, was, properly, the Phison. The Nile, being of old styled Oc-Gehon, and having many branches, or arms, gave rise to the fable of the sea monster Ægeon, whom Ovid represents as supporting himself upon the whales of the ocean.
[220]Balænarumque prementem Ægæona suis immania terga lacertis.
The Scholiast upon Lycophron informs us farther, that the river had three names; and imagines that upon this account it was called Triton. [221]Τριτων ὁ Νειλος, ὁτι τρις μετωνομασθη· προτερον γαρ Ωκεανος αν εκαλειτο, δευτερον Αετος·—το δε Νειλος νεον εστι. I shall not at present controvert his etymology. Let it suffice, that we are assured, both by this author and by others, that the Nile was called Oceanus: and what is alluded to by Pherecydes is certainly a large map or chart. The robe of which he speaks was indeed a Pharos, Φαρος; but a Pharus of a different nature from that which he describes. It was a building, a temple, which was not constructed by the Deity, but dedicated to him. It was one of those towers of which I have before treated; in which were described upon the walls, and otherwise delineated, Ωγηνος και Ωγηνου δωματα, the course of the Gehon, or Nile; and the towns and houses upon that river.
I imagine that the shield of Achilles, in Homer, was copied from something of this sort which the poet had seen in Egypt: for Homer is continually alluding to the customs, as well as to the history, of that kingdom. And, it is evident, that what he describes on the central part of the shield, is a map of the earth, and of the celestial appearances.



[222]Εν μεν Γαιαν ετευξ', εν δ' Ουρανον, εν δε θαλασσαν. Εν δ' ετιθει ΠΟΤΑΜΟΙΟ μεγα σθενος ΩΚΕΑΝΟΙΟ.
The antients loved to wrap up every thing in mystery and fable: they have therefore described Hercules, also, with a robe of this sort:
[223]Ποικιλον ἑιμα φερων, τυπον Αιθερος, εικονα Κοσμου:
He was invested with a robe, which was a type of the heavens, and a representation of the whole world.
The garment of Thetis, which the poets mention as given her upon her supposed marriage with Peleus, was a Pharos of the same kind as that described above. We may learn, from Catullus, who copied the story, that the whole alluded to an historical picture preserved in some tower; and that it referred to matters of great antiquity, though applied by the Greeks to later times, and ascribed to people of their own nation.
[224]Pulvinar vero Divæ geniale locatur Sedibus in mediis; Indo quod dente politum Tincta tegit roseo conchylis purpura fuco. Hæc vestis priscis hominum variata figuris Heroum mirâ virtutes indicat arte.
It contained a description of some notable achievements in the first ages; and a particular account of the Apotheosis of Ariadne, who is described, whatever may be the meaning of it, as carried by Bacchus to heaven. The story is said to have been painted on a robe, or coverlet; because it was delineated upon a Pharos: that word being equivocal, and to be taken in either sense. And here I cannot but take notice of the inconsistency of the Greeks, who make Theseus a partaker in this history; and suppose him to have
been acquainted with Ariadne. If we may credit Plutarch[225], Theseus, as soon as he was advanced towards manhood, went, by the advice of his mother Æthra, from Trœzen, in quest of his father Ægeus at Athens. This was some years after the Argonautic expedition; when Medea had left Jason, and put herself under the protection of this same Ægeus. After having been acknowledged by his father, Theseus went upon his expedition to Crete; where he is said to have first seen Ariadne, and to have carried her away. All this, I say, was done after Jason had married Medea, and had children by her; and after she had left him and was come to Athens. But the story of Ariadne, in the above specimen, is mentioned as a fact of far older date. It was prior to the arrival of Medea in Greece, and even to the Argonautic
expedition. It is spoken of as a circumstance of the highest antiquity: consequently, [226]Theseus could not any ways be concerned in it.
There, is an account in Nonnus of a robe, or Pharos, which Harmonia is supposed to have worn when she was visited by the Goddess of beauty. There was delineated here, as in some above mentioned, the earth, and the heavens, with all the stars. The sea, too, and the rivers, were represented; and the whole was, at the bottom, surrounded by the ocean.
[227]Πρωτην Γαιαν επασσε μεσομφαλον, αμφι δε γαιῃ Ουρανον εσφαιρωσε τυπῳ κεχαραγμενον αστρων. Συμφερτην δε θαλασσαν εφηρμοσε συζυγι Γαιῃ, Και ποταμους ποικιλλεν· επ' ανδρομεῳ δε μετωπῳ Ταυροφυης μορφουτο κερασφορος εγχλοος εικων. Και πυματην παρα πεζαν εϋκλωστοιο χιτωνος Ωκεανος κυκλωσε περιδρομον αντυγα Κοσμου.
All this relates to a painting, either at Sidon or Berytus; which was delineated in a tower, or temple, sacred to Hermon.
Orpheus alludes to a Pharos of this sort, and to the paintings and furniture of it, in his description of the robes with which Apollo, or Dionusus, is invested. He speaks of them as the same Deity.
[228]Ταυτα δε παντα τελειν ἱερᾳ σκευῃ πυκασαντα, Σωμα θεου πλαττειν περιαυγους Ηελιοιο. Πρωτα μεν αργυφεαις εναλιγκιον ακτινεσσι Πεπλον φοινικεον, πυρι εικελον, αμφιβαλεσθαι. Αυταρ ὑπερθε νεβροιο παναιολου ἑυρυ καθαψαι Δερμα πολυστικτον θηρος κατα δεξιον ωμον, Αστρων δαιδαλεων μιμημ', ἱερου τε πολοιο.



Ειτα δ' ὑπερθε νεβρης χρυσεον ζωστηρα βαλεσθαι, Παμφανοωντα, περιξ στερνων φορεειν, μεγα σημα. Ευθυς, ὁτ' εκ περατων γαιης Φαεθων ανορουσων Χρυσειαις ακτισι βαλῃ ῥοον Ωκεανοιο, Αυγη δ' ασπετος ῃ, ανα δε δροσῳ αμφιμιγεισα, Μαρμαιρῃ δινῃσιν ἑλισσομενη κατα κυκλον Προσθε θεου, ζωνε δ' αρ' ὑπο στερνων αμετρητων Φαινετ' αρ' ωκεανου κυκλος, μεγα θαυμ' εσιδεσθαι.
When the poet has thus adorned the Deity, we find, towards the conclusion, that these imaginary robes never shew to such advantage as in the morning. When the sun, says he, rises from the extremities of the earth, and enlightens the ocean with his horizontal rays; then they appear in great splendour, which is increased by the morning dew. All this investiture of the Deity relates to the earth and the heavens,
which were delineated upon a
[229]
skin, δερμα πολυστικτον θηρος, styled πεπλον. This is described, Αστρων δαιδαλεων μιμημ', ἱερου τε πολοιο: as a copy and imitation of all the celestial appearances. The whole was deposited in a Pharos upon the sea shore, upon which the sun, at his rising, darted his early rays; and whose turrets glittered with the dew: Ὑπο στερνων αμετρητων φαινετ'
αρ' ωκεανου κυκλος: from the upper story of the tower, which was of an unmeasurable height, there was an unlimited view of the ocean. This vast element surrounded the edifice like a zone; and afforded a wonderful phænomenon. Such, I imagine, is the solution of the enigma.
TAR, TOR, TARIT.
I have taken notice of the fears and apprehensions, under which the first navigators must necessarily have been, when they traversed unknown seas; and were liable to be entangled among the rocks, and shelves of the deep: and I mentioned the expedients of which they made use to obviate such difficulties, and to render the coast less dangerous. They built upon every hill, and promontory, where they had either commerce or settlement, obelisks, and towers, which they consecrated to some Deity. These served in a twofold capacity, both as seamarks by day, and for beacons by night. And as people in those times made only coasting voyages, they continually went on shore with offerings, in order to gain the assistance of the God, whoever there presided; for these towers were temples, and oftentimes richly furnished and endowed. They were built sometimes on artificial mounds; but generally on natural eminences, that they might be seen at a great distance. They were called by the Amonians, who first
erected them,
[230]
Tar, and Tor; the same as the תור of the Chaldees, which signified both a hill and tower. They were oftentimes compounded, and styled Tor-Is, or fire towers: on account of the light which they exhibited, and the fires which were preserved in them. Hence came the turris of the Romans; and the τυρις, τυῤῥις, τυρσις, τυρσος, of the Greeks. The latter, when the word Tor occurred in
antient history, often changed it to ταυρος, a bull; and invented a number of idle stories in consequence of this change. The Ophite God Osiris, the same as Apollo, was by the Amonians styled Oph-El, and Ope-El: and there was upon the Sinus Persicus a city Opis, where his rites were observed. There seems likewise to have been a temple sacred to him, named Tor-Opel; which the Greeks rendered Ταυροπολος. Strabo speaks of such an oracular temple; and says, that it was in the island Icaria,
towards the mouth of the Tigris:
[231]
Νησον Ικαριον, και ἱερον Απολλωνος ἁγιον εν αυτῃ, και μαντειον Ταυροπολου. Here, instead of Osiris, or Mithras, the serpent Deity, the author presents us with Apollo, the manager of bulls.
One of the principal and most antient settlements of the Amonians upon the ocean was at Gades; where a prince was supposed to have reigned, named Geryon. The harbour at Gades was a very fine one; and had several Tor, or Towers to direct shipping: and as it was usual to imagine the Deity, to whom the temple was erected, to have been the builder, this temple was said to have been built by Hercules. All this the Grecians took to themselves: they attributed the whole to the hero of Thebes: and as he was supposed to conquer wherever he came, they made him subdue Geryon; and changing the Tor, or
Towers, into so many head of cattle, they
[232]
describe him as leading them off in triumph over the Pyranees and Alpes, to Hetruria, and so on to Calabria. From thence, for what reason we know not, he swims them over to Messana in Sicily: and after some stay he swims with them through the sea back again, all the while holding by one of their horns. The bulls of Colchis, with which Jason was supposed to have engaged, were probably of the same nature and original. The people of this country were
Amonians, and had once a
[233]
mighty trade; for the security of which they erected at the entrance of the Phasis towers. These served both as light-houses, and temples; and were sacred to Adorus. They were on this account called Tynador, whence the Greeks formed Tyndarus, Tyndaris, and Tyndaridæ. They



were built after some, which stood near the city [234]Parætonium of Egypt; and they are alluded to by the geographer Dionysius:
[235]Παρ δε μυχον Ποντοιο, μετα χθονα Τυνδαριδαων, Κολχοι ναιεταουσιν επηλυδες Αιγυπτοιο.
Colchis was styled Cutaia, and had been early occupied by the sons of Chus. The chief city, whence the country has been in general denominated, was from its situation called Cal-Chus, and Col-Chus, the hill, or place of Chus. This by the Greeks was rendered Colchis: but as travellers are not uniform in expressing foreign terms, some have rendered what was Colchian, Chalcian, and from Colchus they have formed Χαλκος, brass. The Chalcian towers being moreover interpreted ταυροι, bulls, a story took its rise about the brazen bulls of Colchis. Besides this, there was in these towers a constant fire kept up for the direction of ships by night: whence the bulls were said to breath fire.
We however sometimes meet with sacred towers, which were really denominated Tauri from the worship of the mystic bull, the same as the Apis, and Mneuis of Egypt. Such was probably the temple of
Minotaurus in Crete, where the [236]Deity was represented under an emblematical figure; which consisted of the body of a man with the head of a bull. In Sicily was a promontory Taurus, mentioned by Diodorus Siculus; which was called also Tauromenium. He acquaints us, that Hanno the Carthaginian sent his Admiral with orders παραπλειν επι τον λοφον καλουμενον Ταυρον, to sail along the
coast to the promontory named Taurus. This Taurus, he thinks, was afterwards named Ταυρομενιον,
Tauromenium, from the people who settled, and [237]remained there: as if this were the only place in the world where people settled and remained. It was an antient compound, and no part of it of Grecian
[238]original. Tauromenium is the same as Menotaurium reversed: and the figure of the Deity was varied exactly in the same manner; as is apparent from the coins and engravings which have been found in Sicily. The Minotaur is figured as a man with the head of a bull; the Tauromen as a bull with the face of a [239]man.
Among the [240]Hetrurians this term seems to have been taken in a more enlarged sense; and to have signified a city, or town fortified. When they settled in Italy, they founded many places of strength; and
are reputed to have been the first who introduced the art of fortification. [241]Τυρσηνοι πρωτον
εφευρον την τειχοποιϊαν. Hence the word Tar, and Tur, is often found in the composition of names, which relate to people of this country. They worshipped the Sun, styled Zan, and Zeen; whose temples were called Tur-Zeen: and in consequence of it one of the principal names by which their country was
distinguished, was Turzenia. The Scholiast upon Lycophron mentions it as [242]Χωραν απο
Τυρσηνου κληθεισαν Τυρσηνιαν, a region, which from Tur-Seen was named Tursenia. The Poet
above takes notice of two persons by the names of Tarchon, and Turseen. [243]Ταρχων τε, και
Τυρσηνος, αιθωνες λυκοι. From Tarchon there was a city and district named [244]Tarcunia; from
whence came the family of the Tarquins, or Tarquinii, so well known in the history of [245]Rome. The Amonians esteemed every emanation of light a fountain; and styled it Ain, and Aines: and as they built lighthouses upon every island and insular promontory, they were in consequence of it called Aines, Agnes, Inis, Inesos, Nesos, Nees: and this will be found to obtain in many different countries and languages. The Hetrurians occupied a large tract of sea-coast; on which account they worshipped Poseidon: and one of their principal cities was Poseidonium. They erected upon their shores towers and beacons for the sake of their navigation, which they called Tor-ain: whence they had a still farther denomination of Tur-aini, and their country was named Tur-ainia; the Τυῤῥηνια of the later Greeks. All these appellations are from the same object, the edifices which they erected: even Hetruria seems to have been a compound of Ai-tur; and to have signified the land of Towers. Another name for buildings of this nature was Turit, or Tirit; which signified a tower or turret. I have often mentioned that temples have been mistaken for Deities, and places for persons. We have had an instance of this above; where Tarchon, and Tursenus are supposed to have been founders of colonies. Torone was a place in Macedonia; and signifies literally the Tower of the Sun. The Poets have formed out of it a female
personage; and supposed her to have been the wife of [246]Proteus. So Amphi-Tirit is merely an oracular tower. This too has by the Poets been changed to a female, Amphitrite; and made the wife of Neptune. The name of Triton is a contraction of Tirit-On; and signifies the tower of the Sun, like Torone: but a Deity was framed from it, who was supposed to have had the appearance of a man upwards, but downwards to have been like a fish. From this emblematical representation we may judge of the figure of the real Deity; and be assured that it could be no other than that of Atargatis and Dagon. The
[247]Hetrurians were thought to have been the inventors of trumpets: and in their towers upon the seacoast there were people appointed to be continually upon the watch both by day and night; and to give a proper signal, if any thing happened extraordinary. This was done by a blast from the trumpet; and Triton was hence feigned to have been Neptune's trumpeter. He is accordingly described by Nonnus,



[248]Τυρσηνης Βαρυδουπον εχων σαλπιγγα θαλασσης·
as possessing the deep toned trumpet of the Hetrurian main. However in early times these brazen instruments were but little known: and people were obliged to make use of what was near at hand, the conchs of the sea, which every strand afforded. By sounding these, they gave signals from the top of the towers when any ship appeared: and this is the implement with which Triton is more commonly furnished. The antients divided the night into different watches; the last of which was called cockcrow: and in consequence of this they kept a cock in their Tirat, or Towers, to give notice of the dawn. Hence this bird was sacred to the Sun, and named Alector, Αλεκτωρ: which seems to be a compound out of the titles of that Deity, and of the tower set apart for his service: for all these towers were temples. Those styled Tritonian were oracular; as we may infer from the application made by the Argonauts.
What Homer attributes to Proteus, Pindar ascribes to Triton. [249]Μαντευεται δε ὡς παρ' Ομηρῳ Πρωτευς, και παρα Πινδαρῳ Τριτων τοις Αργοναυταις. Pausanias mentions a tradition of a
[250]Triton near Tanagra, who used to molest women, when they were bathing in the sea; and who was guilty of other acts of violence. He was at last found upon the beach overpowered with wine; and there slain. This Triton was properly a Tritonian, a priest of one of these temples: for the priests appear to have been great tyrants, and oftentimes very brutal. This person had used the natives ill; who took advantage of him, when overpowered with liquor, and put him to death.
The term Tor, in different parts of the world, occurs sometimes a little varied. Whether this happened through mistake, or was introduced for facility of utterance, is uncertain. The temple of the Sun, Tor Heres, in Phenicia was rendered Τριηρης, Trieres; the promontory Tor-Ope-On, in Caria, Triopon; TorHamath, in Cyprus, Trimathus; Tor-Hanes, in India, Trinesia; Tor-Chom, or Chomus, in Palestine, Tricomis. In antient times the title of Anac was often conferred upon the Deities; and their temples were
styled Tor-Anac, and Anac-Tor. The city Miletus was named [251]Anactoria: and there was an Heroüm at Sparta called Ανακτορον, Anactoron; where Castor and Pollux had particular honours, who were peculiarly styled Anactes. It was from Tor-Anac that Sicily was denominated Trinacis and Trinacia. This, in process of time, was still farther changed to Trinacria; which name was supposed to refer to the triangular form of the island. But herein was a great mistake; for, the more antient name was Trinacia, as is manifest from Homer:
[252]Ὁπποτε δη πρωτον πελασῃς ευεργεα νηα Τρινακιῃ νησῳ.
And the name, originally, did not relate to the island in general, but to a part only, and that a small district near Ætna. This spot had been occupied by the first inhabitants, the Cyclopians, Lestrygons, and Sicani: and it had this name from some sacred tower which they built. Callimachus calls it, mistakenly, Trinacria, but says that it was near Ætna, and a portion of the antient Sicani.
[253]Αυε δ' αρ' Αιτνα, Αυε δε Τρινακριη Σικανων ἑδος.
The island Rhodes was called [254]Trinacia, which was not triangular: so that the name had certainly suffered a variation, and had no relation to any figure. The city Trachin, Τραχιν, in Greece, was properly Tor-chun, turris sacra vel regia, like Tarchon in Hetruria. Chun and Chon were titles, said peculiarly to belong to Hercules: [255]Τον Ἡρακλην φησι κατα τον Αιγυπτιων διαλεκτον Κωνα λεγεσθαι. We accordingly find that this place was sacred to Hercules; that it was supposed to have
been [256]founded by him; and that it was called [257]Heraclea.
I imagine that the trident of Poseidon was a mistaken implement; as it does not appear to have any relation to the Deity to whom it has been by the Poets appropriated. Both the towers on the sea-coast, and the beacons, which stood above them, had the name of Tor-ain. This the Grecians changed to Triaina, Τριαινα, and supposed it to have been a three-pronged fork. The beacon, or Torain, consisted of an iron or brazen frame, wherein were three or four tines, which stood up upon a circular basis of the same metal. They were bound with a hoop; and had either the figures of Dolphins, or else foliage in the intervals between them. These filled up the vacant space between the tines, and made them capable of holding the combustible matter with which they were at night filled. This instrument was put upon a high pole, and hung sloping sea-ward over the battlements of the tower, or from the stern of a ship: with this they could maintain, either a smoke by day, or a blaze by night. There was a place in Argos named
[258]Triaina, which was supposed to have been so called from the trident of Neptune. It was undoubtedly a tower, and the true name Tor-ain; as may be shewn from the history with which it is attended. For it stood near a fountain, though a fountain of a different nature from that of which we have been speaking. The waters of Amumone rose here: which Amumone is a variation from Amim-On, the waters of the Sun. The stream rose close to the place, which was named Tor-ain, from its vicinity to the fountain.



A The ancient Tower at Torone B Tower of Cronus in Sicily
Ancient Triainæ
Cerberus was the name of a place, as well as Triton and Torone, though esteemed the dog of hell. We
are told by [259]Eusebius, from Plutarch, that Cerberus was the Sun: but the term properly signified the temple, or place, of the Sun. The great luminary was styled by the Amonians both Or and Abor; that is, light, and the parent of light: and Cerberus is properly Kir-Abor, the place of that Deity. The same temple had different names, from the diversity of the God's titles who was there worshipped. It was called TorCaph-El; which was changed to τρικεφαλος, just as Cahen-Caph-El was rendered



κυνοκεφαλος: and Cerberus was hence supposed to have had three heads. It was also styled Tor
Keren, Turris Regia; which suffered a like change with the word above, being expressed τρικαρηνος: and Cahen Ades, or Cerberus, was hence supposed to have been a triple-headed monster. That these idle figments took their rise from names of places, ill expressed and misinterpreted, may be proved from Palæphatus. He abundantly shews that the mistake arose hence, though he does not point out precisely the mode of deviation. He first speaks of Geryon, who was supposed to have had three heads, and was thence styled τρικεφαλος. [260]Ην δε τοιονδε τουτο· πολις εστιν εν τῳ Ευξινῳ ποντῳ Τρικαρηνια καλουμενη κλ. The purport of the fable about Geryones is this: There was, upon the
Pontus Euxinus, a city named Tricarenia; and thence came the history Γηρυονου του Τρικαρηνου, of Geryon the Tricarenian; which was interpreted, a man with three heads. He mentions the same thing of Cerberus. [261]Λεγουσι περι Κερβερου, ὡς κυων ην, εχων τρεις κεφαλας· δηλον δε ὁτι και ὁυτος απο της πολεως εκληθη Τρικαρηνος, ὡσπερ ὁ Γηρυονης. They say of Cerberus, that he was a dog with three heads: but it is plain that he was so called from a city named Tricaren, or Tricarenia, as well as Geryones. Palæphatus says, very truly, that the strange notion arose from a place. But, to state more precisely the grounds of the mistake, we must observe, that from the antient TorCaph-El arose the blunder about τρικεφαλος; as, from Tor-Keren, rendered Tricarenia, was formed the
term τρικαρηνος: and these personages, in consequence of it, were described with three heads.
As I often quote from Palæphatus, it may be proper to say something concerning him. He wrote early: and seems to have been a serious and sensible person; one, who saw the absurdity of the fables, upon which the theology of his country was founded. In the purport of his name is signified an antiquarian; a person, who dealt in remote researches: and there is no impossibility, but that there might have casually arisen this correspondence between his name and writings. But, I think, it is hardly probable. As he wrote against the mythology of his country, I should imagine that Παλαιφατος, Palæphatus, was an assumed name, which he took for a blind, in order to screen himself from persecution: for the nature of
his writings made him liable to much ill will. One little treatise of [262]Palæphatus about Orion is quoted
verbatim by the Scholiast upon [263]Homer, who speaks of it as a quotation from Euphorion. I should therefore think, that Euphorion was the name of this writer: but as there were many learned men so called, it may be difficult to determine which was the author of this treatise.
Homer, who has constructed the noblest poem that was ever framed, from the strangest materials, abounds with allegory and mysterious description. He often introduces ideal personages, his notions of which he borrowed from the edifices, hills, and fountains; and from whatever savoured of wonder and antiquity. He seems sometimes to blend together two different characters of the same thing, a borrowed one, and a real; so as to make the true history, if there should be any truth at bottom, the more extraordinary and entertaining.
I cannot help thinking, that Otus and Ephiâltes, those gigantic youths, so celebrated by the Poets, were
two lofty towers. They were building to Alohim, called [264]Aloëus; but were probably overthrown by an earthquake. They are spoken of by Pindar as the sons of Iphimedeia; and are supposed to have been slain by Apollo in the island Naxos.
[265]Εν δε Ναξῳ Φαντι θανειν λιπαρᾳ Ιφιμεδειας παιδας Ωτον, και σε, τολμαεις Εφιαλτα αναξ.
They are also mentioned by Homer, who styles them γηγενεις, or earthborn: and his description is equally fine.
[266]Και ῥ' ετεκεν δυο παιδε, μινυνθαδιω δε γενεσθην, Ωτον τ' αντιθεον, τηλεκλειτον τ' Εφιαλτην· Ὁυς δη μηκιστους θρεψε ζειδωρος αρουρα, Και πολυ καλλιστους μετα γε κλυτον Ωριωνα. Εννεωροι γαρ τοι γε, και εννεαπηχεες ησαν Ευρος, αταρ μηκος γε γενεσθην εννεοργυιοι.
Homer includes Orion in this description, whom he mentions elsewhere; and seems to borrow his ideas from a similar object, some tower, or temple, that was sacred to him. Orion was Nimrod, the great hunter in the Scriptures, called by the Greeks Nebrod. He was the founder of Babel, or Babylon; and is represented as a gigantic personage. The author of the Paschal Chronicle speaks of him in this light.
[267]Νεβρωδ Γιγαντα, τον την Βαβυλωνιαν κτισαντα—ὁντινα καλουσιν Ωριωνα. He is called Alorus by Abydenus, and Apollodorus; which was often rendered with the Amonian prefix



Pelorus. Homer describes him as a great hunter; and of an enormous stature, even superior to the Aloeidæ above mentioned.
[268]
Τον δε μετ' Ωριωνα Πελωριον εισενοησα, Θηρας ὁμου ειλευντα κατ' ασφοδελον λειμωνα.
The Poet styles him Pelorian; which betokens something vast, and is applicable to any towering personage, but particularly to Orion. For the term Pelorus is the name by which the towers of Orion were called. Of these there seems to have been one in Delos; and another of more note, to which Homer probably alluded, in Sicily; where Orion was particularly reverenced. The streight of Rhegium was a dangerous pass: and this edifice was erected for the security of those who were obliged to go through it.
It stood near Zancle; and was called
[269]
Pelorus, because it was sacred to Alorus, the same as [270]
Orion. There was likewise a river named from him, and rendered by Lycophron
[271]
Elorus. The tower is mentioned by Strabo; but more particularly by Diodorus Siculus. He informs us that, according to the tradition of the place, Orion there resided; and that, among other works, he raised this very mound and promontory, called Pelorus and Pelorias, together with the temple, which was situated upon it. [272]
Ωριωνα προσχωσαι το κατα την Πελωριαδα κειμενον ακρωτηριον, και το τεμενος του Ποσειδωνος κατασκευασαι, τιμωμενον ὑπο των εγχωριων διαφεροντως. We find from hence that there was a tower of this sort, which belonged to Orion: and that the word Pelorion was a term borrowed from these edifices, and made use of metaphorically, to denote any thing stupendous and large. The description in Homer is of a mixed nature: wherein he retains the antient tradition of a gigantic person; but borrows his ideas from the towers sacred to him. I have taken notice before, that all temples of old were supposed to be oracular; and by the Amonians were called Pator and Patara. This temple of Orion was undoubtedly a Pator; to which mariners resorted to know the event of their voyage, and to make their offerings to the God. It was on this account styled Tor Pator; which being by the Greeks expressed τριπατωρ, tripator, gave rise to the notion, that this earthborn giant had three fathers.
[273]
Ωριων τριπατωρ απο μητερος ανθορε γαιης.
These towers, near the sea, were made use of to form a judgment of the weather, and to observe the heavens: and those which belonged to cities were generally in the Acropolis, or higher part of the place. This, by the Amonians, was named Bosrah; and the citadel of Carthage, as well as of other cities, is known to have been so denominated. But the Greeks, by an unavoidable fatality, rendered it uniformly [274]
βυρσα, bursa, a skin: and when some of them succeeded to Zancle
[275]
in Sicily, finding that Orion
had some reference to Ouran, or Ouranus, and from the name of the temple (τριπατωρ) judging that he must have had three fathers, they immediately went to work, in order to reconcile these different ideas. They accordingly changed Ouran to ουρειν; and, thinking the misconstrued hide, βυρσα, no improper utensil for their purpose, they made these three fathers co-operate in a most wonderful manner for the production of this imaginary person; inventing the most slovenly legend that ever was devised. [276]
Τρεις (θεοι) του σφαγεντος βοος βυρσῃ ενουρησαν, και εξ αυτης Ωριων εγενετο. Tres Dei in bovis mactati pelle minxerunt, et inde natus est Orion.
TIT TITH.
When towers were situated upon eminences fashioned very round, they were by the Amonians called
Tith; which answers to תד in Hebrew, and to
[277]
τιτθη, and τιτθος, in Greek. They were so denominated from their resemblance to a woman's breast; and were particularly sacred to Orus and Osiris, the Deities of light, who by the Grecians were represented under the title of Apollo. Hence the
summit of Parnassus was
[278]
named Tithorea, from Tith-Or: and hard by was a city, mentioned by Pausanias, of the same name; which was alike sacred to Orus and Apollo. The same author takes notice
of a hill, near Epidaurus, called
[279]
Τιτθειον ορος Απολλωνος. There was a summit of the like
nature at Samos, which, is by Callimachus styled the breast of Parthenia:
[280]
Διαβροχον ὑδατι μαστον Παρθενιης. Mounds of this nature are often, by Pausanias and Strabo, termed, from their
resemblance,
[281]
μαστοειδεις. Tithonus, whose longevity is so much celebrated, was nothing more
than one of these structures, a Pharos, sacred to the sun, as the name plainly shews. Tith-On is μαστος
ἑλιου, the mount of the
[282]
Sun. As he supplied the place of that luminary, he is said to have been beloved by Aurora, and through her favour to have lived many ages. This, indeed, is the reverse of that
which is fabled of the
[283]
Cyclopes, whose history equally relates to edifices. They are said to have raised the jealousy of Apollo, and to have been slain by his arrows: yet it will be found at bottom of the same purport. The Cyclopian turrets upon the Sicilian shore fronted due east: and their lights must



necessarily have been extinguished by the rays of the rising Sun. This, I imagine, is the meaning of Apollo's slaying the Cyclopes with his arrows. Tethys, the antient Goddess of the sea, was nothing else but an old tower upon a mount; of the same shape, and erected for the same purposes, as those above. On this account it was called Tith-Is, μαστος πυρος. Thetis seems to have been a transposition of the same name, and was probably a Pharos, or Fire-tower, near the sea.
These mounts, λοφοι μαστοειδεις, were not only in Greece; but in Egypt, Syria, and most parts of the world. They were generally formed by art; being composed of earth, raised very high; which was sloped gradually, and with great exactness: and the top of all was crowned with a fair tower. The situation of these buildings made them be looked upon as places of great safety: and the reverence in which they were held added to the security. On these accounts they were the repositories of much wealth and treasure: in times of peril they were crowded with things of value. In Assyria was a temple named
Azara; which the Parthian plundered, and is said to have carried off ten thousand talents:
[284]
Χαι ηρε παλαντων μυριων γαζαν. The same author mentions two towers of this sort in Judea, not far from
Jericho, belonging to Aristobulus and Alexander, and styled
[285]
Γαζοφυλακια των Τυραννων: which were taken by Pompeius Magnus in his war with the Jews. There were often two of these mounds of equal height in the same inclosure; such as are described by Josephus at Machærus, near some warm
fountains. He mentions here a cavern and a rock;
[286]
σπηλαιον—τῃ πετρᾳ προυχουσῃ σκεπομενον· ταυτης ανωθεν ὡσανει μαστοι δυο ανεχουσιν, αλληλων ολιγῳ διεστωτες: and above it two round hills like breasts, at no great distance from each other. To such as these
Solomon alludes, when he makes his beloved say,
[287]
I am a wall, and my breasts like towers. Though the word חומה , Chumah, or Comah, be generally rendered a wall; yet I should think that in this place it signified the ground which the wall surrounded: an inclosure sacred to Cham, the Sun, who was particularly worshipped in such places. The Mizraïm called these hills Typhon, and the cities where they were erected, Typhonian. But as they stood within inclosures sacred to Chom, they were also styled Choma. This, I imagine, was the meaning of the term in this place, and in some others; where the text alludes to a different nation, and to a foreign mode of worship. In these temples the Sun was principally adored, and the rites of fire celebrated: and this seems to have been the reason why the judgment denounced against them is uniformly, that they shall be destroyed by fire. If we suppose Comah to mean a mere wall, I do not see why fire should be so particularly destined against a part, which is the least
combustible. The Deity says,
[288]
I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus.
[289]
I will send a fire on
the wall of Gaza.
[290]
I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus.
[291]
I will kindle a
[292]
fire in the wall of Rabbah. As the crime which brought down this curse was idolatry, and the term used in all these instances is Chomah; I should think that it related to a temple of Chom, and his high places, called by the Greeks λοφοι μαστοειδεις: and to these the spouse of Solomon certainly alludes, when she Says,
εγω τειχος, και ὁι μαστοι μου ὡς πυργοι. This will appear from another passage in Solomon,
where he makes his beloved say,
[293]
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts. If she be a Comah, we will build upon her a palace of silver. A palace cannot be supposed to be built upon a wall; though it may be inclosed with one. The place for building was a Comah, or eminence. It is said of Jotham, king
of Judah, that
[294]
on the wall of Ophel he built much. Ophel is literally Pytho Sol, the Ophite Deity of Egypt and Canaan. What is here termed a wall, was a Comah, or high place, which had been of old erected to the sun by the Jebusites. This Jotham fortified, and turned it to advantage; whereas before it was not used, or used for a bad purpose. The ground set apart for such use was generally oval; and towards one extremity of the long diameter, as it were in the focus, were these mounds and towers erected. As they were generally royal edifices, and at the same time held sacred; they were termed Tarchon, like Tarchonium in Hetruria: which by a corruption was in later times rendered Trachon, Τραχων. There were two hills of this denomination near Damascus; from whence undoubtedly the
Regio Trachonitis received its name:
[295]
ὑπερκεινται δε αυτης (Δαμασκου) δυο λεγομενοι Τραχωνες. These were hills with towers, and must have been very fair to see to. Solomon takes notice
of a hill of this sort upon
[296]
Lebanon, looking toward Damascus; which he speaks of as a beautiful structure. The term Trachon seems to have been still farther sophisticated by the Greeks, and expressed Δρακων, Dracon: from whence in, great measure arose the notion of treasures being guarded by [297]
Dragons. We read of the gardens of the Hesperides being under the protection of a sleepless serpent: and the golden fleece at Colchis was entrusted to such another guardian; of which there is a fine description in Apollonius.
[298]
Πυργους εισοψεσθε Κυταεος Αιηταο, Αλσος τε σκιοεν Αρεος, τοθι κωας επ' ακρης Πεπταμενον φηγοιο Δρακων, τερας αινον ιδεσθαι, Αμφις οπιπτευει δεδοκημενος· ουδε ὁι ημαρ, Ου κνεφας ἡδυμος ὑπνος αναιδεα δαμναται οσσε.



Nonnus often introduces a dragon as a protector of virginity; watching while the damsel slumbered, but
sleepless itself: [299]Ὑπναλεης αγρυπνον οπιπτευτηρα κορειης: and in another place he mentions
[300]Φρουρον εχεις απελεθρον Οφιν. Such an one guarded the nymph Chalcomeda,
[301]Παρθενικης αγαμοιο βοηθοος. The Goddess Proserpine had two [302]dragons to protect her, by the appointment of her mother Demeter.
Such are the poetical representations: but the history at bottom relates to sacred towers, dedicated to the symbolical worship of the serpent; where there was a perpetual watch, and a light ever burning. The Titans, Τιτανες, were properly Titanians; a people so denominated from their worship, and from the places where it was celebrated. They are, like Orion and the Cyclopians, represented as gigantic persons: and they were of the same race, the children of Anak. The Titanian temples were stately edifices, erected in Chaldea, as well as in lower Egypt, upon mounds of earth, λοφοι μαστοειδεις, and
sacred to Hanes; Τιτανις and Τιτανες are compounds of Tit-Hanes; and signify literally μαστος
ἡλιου, the conical hill of Orus. They were by their situation strong, and probably made otherwise defensible.
In respect to the legends about dragons, I am persuaded that the antients sometimes did wilfully misrepresent things, in order to increase the wonder. Iphicrates related, that in Mauritania there were
dragons of such extent, that grass grew upon their backs: [303]Δρακοντας τε λεγει μεγαλους, ὡστε
και ποαν επιπεφυκεναι. What can be meant under this representation but a Dracontium, within whose precincts they encouraged verdure? It is said of Taxiles, a mighty prince in India, and a rival of Porus, that, upon the arrival of Alexander the Great, he shewed him every thing that was in his country curious, and which could win the attention of a foreigner. Among other things he carried him to see a
[304]Dragon, which was sacred to Dionusus; and itself esteemed a God. It was of a stupendous size, being in extent equal to five acres; and resided in a low deep place, walled round to a great height. The Indians offered sacrifices to it: and it was daily fed by them from their flocks and herds, which it devoured at an amazing rate. In short my author says, that it was treated rather as a tyrant, than a
benevolent Deity. Two Dragons of the like nature are mentioned by [305]Strabo; which are said to have resided in the mountains of Abisares, or Abiosares, in India: the one was eighty cubits in length, the other one hundred and forty. Similar to the above is the account given by Posidonius of a serpent, which
he saw in the plains of Macra, a region in Syria; and which he styles [306]δρακοντα πεπτωκοτα
νεκρον. He says, that it was about an acre in length; and of a thickness so remarkable, as that two persons on horseback, when they rode on the opposite sides, could not see one another. Each scale was as big as a, shield; and a man might ride in at its mouth. What can this description allude to, this δρακων πεπτωκως, but the ruins of an antient Ophite temple; which is represented in this enigmatical manner to raise admiration? The plains of Macra were not far from Mount Lebanon and Hermon; where the Hivites resided; and where serpent-worship particularly prevailed. The Indian Dragon above mentioned seems to have been of the same nature. It was probably a temple, and its environs; where a society of priests resided, who were maintained by the public; and who worshipped the Deity under the semblance of a serpent. Tityus must be ranked among the monsters of this class. He is by the Poets represented as a stupendous being, an earthborn giant:
[307]Terræ omniparentis alumnum, —— per tota novem cui jugera corpus Porrigitur.
By which is meant, that he was a tower, erected upon a conical mount of earth, which stood in an inclosure of nine acres. He is said to have a vulture preying upon his heart, or liver; immortale jecur tondens. The whole of which history is borrowed from Homer, who mentions two vultures engaged in tormenting him.
[308]Και Τιτυον ειδον Γαιης ερικυδεος ὑιον, Κειμενον εν δαπεδῳ· ὁδ' επ' εννεα κειτο πελεθρα· Γυπε δε μιν ἑκατερθε παρημενοι ηπαρ εκειρον, Δερτρον εσω δυνοντες, ὁδ' ουκ απαμυνετο χερσι.
The same story is told of Prometheus, who is said to have been exposed upon Mount Caucasus, near Colchis; with this variation, that an eagle is placed over him, preying upon his heart. These strange histories are undoubtedly taken from the symbols and devices which were carved upon the front of the antient Amonian temples; and especially those of Egypt. The eagle and the vulture were the insignia of
that country: whence it was called Ai-Gupt, and [309]Aetia, from Ait and Gupt, which signified an eagle and vulture. Ait was properly a title of the Deity, and signified heat: and the heart, the centre of vital
heat, was among the Egyptians styled [310]Ait: hence we are told by [311]Orus Apollo, that a heart over



burning coals was an emblem of Egypt. The Amonians dealt much in hieroglyphical representations. Nonnus mentions one of this sort, which seems to have been a curious emblem of the Sun. It was engraved upon a jasper, and worn for a bracelet. Two serpents entwined together, with their heads different ways, were depicted in a semicircular manner round the extreme part of the gem. At the top between their heads was an eagle; and beneath a sacred carriage, called Cemus.
[312]Αιετος εν χρυσειος, ἁτε πλατυν ηερα τεμνων, Ορθος, εχιδναιων διδυμων μεσσηγυ καρηνων, Ὑψιφανης πτερυγων πισυρων τετραζυγι κημῳ. Τῃ μεν ξανθος ιασπις επετρεχε.
The history of Tityus, Prometheus, and many other poetical personages, was certainly taken from hieroglyphics misunderstood, and badly explained. Prometheus was worshipped by the Colchians as a
Deity; and had a temple and high place, called [313]Πετρα Τυφαονια, upon Mount Caucasus: and the device upon the portal was Egyptian, an eagle over a heart. The magnitude of these personages was taken from the extent of the temple inclosures. The words, per tota novem cui jugera corpus Porrigitur, relate to a garden of so many acres. There were many such inclosures, as I have before taken notice: some of them were beautifully planted, and ornamented with pavilions and fountains, and called
Paradisi. One of this sort stood in Syria upon the river [314]Typhon, called afterwards Orontes. Places of this nature are alluded to under the description of the gardens of the Hesperides, and Alcinous; and the gardens of Adonis. Such were those at Phaneas in Palestine; and those beautiful gardens of Daphne upon the Orontes above mentioned; and in the shady parts of Mount Libanus. Those of Daphne are described by Strabo, who mentions, [315]Μεγα τε και συνηρεφες αλσος, διαῤῥεομενον πηγαιοις ὑδασιν· εν μεσῳ δε Ασυλον τεμενος, και νεως Απολλωνοι και Αρτεμιδος. There was a fine wide extended grove, which sheltered the whole place; and which was watered with numberless fountains. In the centre of the whole was a sanctuary and asylum, sacred to Artemis and Apollo. The Groves of Daphne upon the mountains Heræi in Sicily, and the garden and temple at bottom were very
noble; and are finely described by [316]Diodorus.
I have taken notice that the word δρακων, draco, was a mistake for Tarchon, Ταρχων: which was
sometimes expressed Τραχων; as is observable in the Trachones at Damascus. When the Greeks understood that in these temples people worshipped a serpent Deity, they concluded that Trachon was a serpent: and hence came the name of Draco to be appropriated to such an animal. For the Draco was an imaginary being, however afterwards accepted and understood. This is manifest from Servius, who
distributes the serpentine species into three tribes; and confines the Draco solely to temples: [317]Angues aquarum sunt, serpentes terrarum, Dracones templorum. That the notion of such animals took its rise from the temples of the Syrians and Egyptians, and especially from the Trachones, Τραχωνες, at Damascus, seems highly probable from the accounts above: and it may be rendered still more apparent from Damasenus, a supposed hero, who took his name from the city Damasene, or Damascus. He is
represented as an earthborn giant, who encountered two dragons: [318]Και χθονος απλετον ὑια,
δρακοντοφονον Δαμασηνα. One of the monsters, with which he fought, is described of an
enormous size, πεντηκονταπελεθρος Οφις, a serpent in extent of fifty acres: which certainly, as I have before insinuated, must have a reference to the grove and garden, wherein such Ophite temple
stood at Damascus. For the general measurement of all these wonderful beings by [319]jugera or acres proves that such an estimate could not relate to any thing of solid contents; but to an inclosure of that superficies. Of the same nature as these was the gigantic personage, supposed, to have been seen at Gades by Cleon Magnesius. He made, it seems, no doubt of Tityus and other such monsters having existed. For being at Gades, he was ordered to go upon a certain expedition by Hercules: and upon his return to the island, he saw upon the shore a huge sea-man, who had been thunderstruck, and lay extended upon the ground: [320]τουτον πλεθρα μεν πεντε μαλιστα επεχειν; and his dimensions were not less than five acres. So Typhon, Caanthus, Orion, are said to have been killed by lightning. Orpheus too, who by some is said to have been torn to pieces by the Thracian women, by others is represented as slain by the bolt of Jupiter: and his epitaph imports as much.
[321]Θρηϊκα χρυσολυρην τηδ' Ορφεα Μουσαι εθαψαν, Ὁν κτανεν ὑψιμεδων Ζευς ψολοεντι βελει.
All these histories relate to sacred inclosures; and to the worship of the serpent, and rites of fire, which
were practised within them. Such an inclosure was by the Greeks styled [322]τεμενος, and the mound
or high place ταφος and τυμβος; which had often a tower upon it, esteemed a sanctuary and asylum.
Lycophron makes Cassandra say of Diomedes, [323]ΤYΜΒΟΣ δ' αυτον εκσωσει: the temple, to which
he shall fly, shall save him. In process of time both the word τυμβος, as well as ταφος, were no longer



taken in their original sense; but supposed uniformly to have been places of sepulture. This has turned many temples into tombs: and the Deities, to whom they were sacred, have been represented as there buried. There was an Orphic Dracontium at Lesbos; where a serpent was supposed to have been going to devour the remains of Orpheus: and this temple being of old styled Petra, it was fabled of the serpent, that he was turned into stone.
[324] Hic ferus expositum peregrinis anguis arenis Os petit, et sparsos stillanti rore capillos. Tandem Phœbus adest: morsusque inferre parantem Arcet; et in lapidem rictus serpentis apertos Congelat; et patulos, ut erant, indurat hiatus.
All the poetical accounts of heroes engaging with dragons have arisen from a misconception about these towers and temples; which those persons either founded, or else took in war. Or, if they were Deities of whom the story is told, these buildings were erected to their honour. But the Greeks made no distinction. They were fond of heroism; and interpreted every antient history according to their own prejudices: and in the most simple narrative could find out a martial achievement. No colony could settle any where, and build an Ophite temple, but there was supposed to have been a contention between a hero and a dragon. Cadmus, as I have shewn, was described in conflict with such an one near Thebes, whose teeth he sowed in the earth:
[325]οδοντας Αονιοιο δρακοντος, ὁν ωγυγιῃ ενι Θηβῃ Καδμος, ὁτ' Ευρωπην διζημενος εισαφικανε, Πεφνε.
Serpents are said to have infested [326]Cyprus, when it was occupied by its first inhabitants: and there
was a fearful dragon in the isle of [327]Salamis. The Python of Parnassus is well known, which Apollo was supposed to have slain, when he was very young; a story finely told by Apollonius.
[328]Ὡς ποτε πετραιῃ ὑπο δειραδι Παρνησσοιο Δελφυνην τοξοισι πελωριον εξεναριξε, Κουρος εων ετι γυμνος, ετι πλοκαμοισι γεγηθως.
After all, this dragon was a serpent temple; a tumbos, τυμβος, formed of earth, and esteemed of old
oracular. To this, Hyginus bears witness. [329]Python, Terræ filius, Draco ingens. Hic ante Apollinem ex oraculo in monte Parnasso responsa dare solitus est. Plutarch says, that the dispute between Apollo and
the Dragon was about the privilege of the place. [330]Ὁι Δελφων θεολογοι νομιζουσιν ενταυθα
ποτε προς οφιν τῳ Θεῳ περι του χρηστηριου μαχην γενεσθαι. Hence we may perceive, that he was in reality the Deity of the temple; though the Greeks made an idle distinction: and he was treated with divine honours. [331]Πυθοι μεν ουν ὁ Δρακων ὁ Πυθιος θρησκευεται, και του Οφεως ἡ πανηγυρις καταγγελλεται Πυθια. It is said, moreover, that the seventh day was appointed for a
festival in the temple, and celebrated with a Pæan to the [332]serpent.
We often read of virgins, who were exposed to dragons and sea-monsters; and of dragons which laid waste whole provinces, till they were at length, by some person of prowess, encountered and slain. These histories relate to women, who were immured in towers by the sea-side; and to banditti, who got
possession of these places, whence they infested the adjacent country. The [333]author of the Chronicon Paschale supposes, that Andromeda, whom the poets describe as chained to a rock, and exposed to a sea-monster, was in reality confined in a temple of Neptune, a Petra of another sort. These dragons are represented as sleepless; because, in such places there were commonly lamps burning, and a watch maintained. In those more particularly set apart for religious service there was a fire, which never went out.
[334]Irrestincta focis servant altaria flammas.
The dragon of Apollonius is ever watchful.
Ουδε ὁι ημαρ, Ου κνεφας ἡδυμος ὑπνος αναιδεα δαμναται οσσε.
What the Poet styles the eyes of the Dragon, were undoubtedly windows in the upper part of the building, through which the fire appeared. Plutarch takes notice, that in the temple of Amon there was a
[335]light continually burning. The like was observable in other temples of the [336]Egyptians. Pausanias



mentions the lamp of Minerva [337]Polias at Athens, which never went out: the same custom was kept
up in most of the [338]Prutaneia. The Chaldeans and Persians had sacred hearths; on which they
preserved a [339]perpetual fire. In the temple of [340]Apollo Carneus at Cyrene, the fire upon the altar was never suffered to be extinguished. A like account is given by Said Ebn Batrick of the sacred fire,
which was preserved in the great temple at [341]Aderbain in Armenia. The Nubian Geographer mentions
a nation in India, called [342]Caimachitæ, who had large Puratheia, and maintained a perpetual fire.
According to the Levitical law, a constant fire was to be kept up upon the altar of God. [343]The fire shall be ever burning upon the altar: it shall never go out.
From what has preceded, we may perceive, that many personages have been formed out of places. And I cannot help suspecting much more of antient history, than I dare venture to acknowledge. Of the mythic age I suppose almost every circumstance to have been imported, and adopted; or else to be a fable. I imagine, that Chiron, so celebrated for his knowledge, was a mere personage formed from a tower, or temple, of that name. It stood in Thessaly; and was inhabited by a set of priests, called Centauri. They were so denominated from the Deity they worshipped, who was represented under a particular form. They styled him Cahen-Taur: and he was the same as the Minotaur of Crete, and the Tauromen of Sicilia; consequently of an emblematical and mixed figure. The people, by whom this worship was introduced, were many of them Anakim; and are accordingly represented as of great strength and
stature. Such persons among the people of the east were styled [344]Nephelim: which the Greeks in after times supposed to relate to νεφελη, a cloud. In consequence of this, they described the Centaurs as born of a cloud: and not only the Centaurs, but Ixion, and others, were reputed of the same original. The
chief city of the Nephelim stood in Thessaly, and is mentioned by [345]Palæphatus: but through the misconception of his countrymen it was expressed Νεφελη, Nephele, a cloud. The Grecians in general were of this race; as will be abundantly shewn. The Scholiast upon Lycophron mentions, that the descendants of Hellen were by a woman named Nephele, whom Athamas was supposed to have
married. [346]Αθαμας ὁ Αιολου του Ἑλληνος παις εκ Νεφελης γεννᾳ Ἑλλην, και Φριξον. The author has made a distinction between Helle, and Hellen; the former of which he describes in the feminine. By Phrixus is meant Φρυξ, Phryx, who passed the Hellespont, and settled in Asia minor. However obscured the history may be, I think the purport of it is plainly this, that the Hellenes, and Phrygians were of the Nephelim or Anakim race. Chiron was a temple, probably at Nephele in Thessalia, the most antient seat of the Nephelim. His name is a compound of Chir-On, in purport the same as Kir-On, the tower and temple of the Sun. In places of this sort people used to study the heavenly motions: and they were made use of for seminaries, where young people were instructed; on which account they were styled παιδοτροφοι. Hence Achilles was supposed to have been taught by
[347]Chiron, who is reported to have had many disciples. They are enumerated by Xenophon in his
treatise upon hunting, and amount to a large number. [348]Εγενοντο αυτῳ μαθηται κυνηγεσιων τε, και ἑτερων καλων, Κεφαλος, Ασκληπιος, Μελανιων, Νεστωρ, Αμφιαραος, Πηλευς, Τελαμων, Μελεαγρος, Θησευς, Ἱππολυτος, Παλαμηδης, Οδυσσευς, Μενεσθευς, Διομηδης, Καστωρ, Πολυδευκης, Μαχαων, Ποδαλειριος, Αντιλοχος, Αινειας, Αχιλλευς. Jason is by
Pindar made to say of himself, [349]Φαμι διδασκαλιαν Χειρωνος οισειν: and the same circumstance
is mentioned in another place; [350]Κρονιδᾳ δε τραφεν Χειρωνι δωκαν (Ιασονα). These histories could not be true of Chiron as a person: for, unless we suppose him to have been, as the Poets would persuade us, of a different species from the rest of mankind, it will be found impossible for him to have had pupils in such different ages. For not only Æsculapius, mentioned in this list, but Apollo likewise learnt of him the medicinal arts. [351]Ασκληπιος και Απολλων παρα Χειρωνι τῳ Κενταυρῳ ιασθαι διδασκονται. Xenophon indeed, who was aware of this objection, says, that the term of
Chiron's life was sufficient for the performance of all that was attributed to him: [352]Ὁ Χειρωνος βιος
πασιν εξηρκει· Ζευς γαρ και Χειρων αδελφοι: but he brings nothing in proof of what he alleges. It is moreover incredible, were we to suppose such a being as Chiron, that he should have had pupils from
so many different [353]countries. Besides many of them, who are mentioned, were manifestly ideal personages. For not to speak of Cephalus and Castor, Apollo was a Deity; and Æsculapius was the
[354]like: by some indeed esteemed the son of the former; by others introduced rather as a title, and
annexed to the names of different Gods. Aristides uses it as such in his invocation of [355]Hercules: Ιω,
Παιαν, Ἡρακλες, Ασκληπιε: and he also speaks of the temple of Jupiter Æsculapius, Διος
Ασκληπιου νεως. It was idle therefore in the Poets to suppose that these personages could have been pupils to Chiron. Those that were instructed, whoever they may have been, partook only of Chironian education; and were taught in the same kind of academy: but not by one person, nor probably in the same place. For there were many of these towers, where they taught astronomy, music, and other sciences. These places were likewise courts of judicature, where justice was administered: whence Chiron was said to have been φιλοφρονεων, και δικαιοτατος:



[356]Ὁν Χειρων εδιδαξε δικαιοτατος Κενταυρων.
The like character is given of him by Hermippus, of Berytus.
[357]Ὁυτος
Εις τε δικαιοσυνην θνητων γενος ηγαγε, δειξας Ὁρκον, και θυσιας ἱλαρας, και σχηματ' Ολυμπου.
Right was probably more fairly determined in the Chironian temples, than in others. Yet the whole was certainly attended with some instances of cruelty: for human sacrifices are mentioned as once common, especially at Pella in Thessaly; where, if they could get a person, who was an Achean by birth, they
used to offer him at the altars of Peleus and [358]Chiron.
There were many edifices denominated Chironian, and sacred to the Sun. Charon was of the same purport, and etymology; and was sacred to the same Deity. One temple of this name, and the most remarkable of any, stood opposite to Memphis on the western side of the Nile. It was near the spot where most people of consequence were buried. There is a tower in this province, but at some distance
from the place here spoken of, called [359]Kiroon at this day. As Charon was a temple near the catacombs, or place of burial; all the persons who were brought to be there deposited, had an offering made on their account, upon being landed on this shore. Hence arose the notion of the fee of Charon, and of the ferryman of that name. This building stood upon the banks of a canal, which communicated with the Nile: but that which is now called Kiroon, stands at some distance to the west, upon the lake
[360]Mœris; where only the kings of Egypt had a right of sepulture. The region of the catacombs was
called the Acheronian and [361]Acherusian plain, and likewise the Elysian: and the stream, which ran by it, had the name of Acheron. They are often alluded to by Homer, and other Poets, when they treat of the region of departed souls. The Amonians conferred these names upon other places, where they settled, in
different parts of the world. They are therefore to be met with in [362]Phrygia, [363]Epirus, [364]Hellas,
[365]Apulia, [366]Campania, and other countries. The libri [367]Acherontii in Italy, mentioned by Arnobius, were probably transcripts from some hieroglyphical writings, which had been preserved in the Acherontian towers of the Nile. These were carried by Tages to Hetruria; where they were held in great veneration.
As towers of this sort were seminaries of learning, Homer from one of them has formed the character of sage Mentor; under whose resemblance the Goddess of wisdom was supposed to be concealed. By Mentor, I imagine, that the Poet covertly alludes to a temple of Menes. It is said, that Homer in an
illness was cured by one [368]Mentor, the son of Αλκιμος, Alcimus. The person probably was a Mentorian priest, who did him this kind office, if there be any truth in the story. It was from an oracular temple styled Mentor; and Man-Tor, that the sacred cakes had the name of Amphimantora. [369]Αμφιμαντορα, αλφιτα μελιτι δεδευμενα.
Castor, the supposed disciple of Chiron, was in reality the same as Chiron; being a sacred tower, a Chironian edifice, which served both for a temple and Pharos. As these buildings for the most part stood on strands of the sea, and promontories; Castor was esteemed in consequence of it a tutelary Deity of that element. The name seems to be a compound of Ca-Astor, the temple or place of Astor; who was rendered at different times Asterius, Asterion, and Astarte. Ca-Astor was by the Greeks abbreviated to Castor; which in its original sense I should imagine betokened a fire-tower: but the Greeks in this instance, as well as in innumerable others, have mistaken the place and temple for the Deity, to whom it was consecrated. The whole history of Castor and Pollux, the two Dioscuri, is very strange and inconsistent. Sometimes they are described as two mortals of Lacedæmon, who were guilty of violence and rapine, and were slain for their wickedness. At other times they are represented as the two principal Deities; and styled Dii Magni, Dii Maximi, Dii Potentes, Cabeiri. Mention is made by Pausanias of the
great regard paid to them, and particularly by the Cephalenses. [370]Μεγαλους γαρ σφας ὁι ταυτῃ
Θεους ονομαζουσιν. The people there style them by way of eminence the Great Gods. There are altars
extant, which are inscribed [371]CASTORI ET POLLUCI DIIS MAGNIS. In [372]Gruter is a Greek inscription to the same purport. Γαιος Γαιου Αχαρνευς Ἱερευς γενομενος Θεων Μεγαλων Διοσκορων Καβειρων. But though Castor was enshrined, as a God, he was properly a Tarchon, such as I have before described; and had all the requisites which are to be found in such buildings. They were the great repositories of treasure; which people there entrusted, as to places of great security. The temple of Castor vas particularly famous on this account, as we may learn from Juvenal:
[373]Æratâ multus in arcâ Fiscus, et ad vigilem ponendi Castora nummi.
The Deity, who was alluded to under the name of Castor, was the Sun: and he had several temples of that denomination in Laconia, and other parts of Greece. His rites were first introduced by people from



Egypt and Canaan. This we may infer, among other circumstances, from the title of Anac being so particularly conferred on him and his brother Pollux: whence their temple was styled Ανακειον in
Laconia; and their festival at Athens ανακεια, anakeia. For Anac was a Canaanitish term of honour;
which the Greeks changed to αναξ and [374]ανακτες. I have before mentioned, that in these places were preserved the Archives of the cities and provinces in which they stood: and they were often made use of for courts of judicature, called πρυτανεια, and prætoria; whither the antient people of the place resorted, to determine about right and wrong. Hence it is that Castor and Pollux, two names of the same personage, were supposed to preside over judicial affairs. This department does but ill agree with the general and absurd character, under which they are represented: for what has horsemanship and boxing to do with law and equity? But these were mistaken attributes, which arose from a misapplication of history. Within the precincts of their temples was a parade for boxing and wrestling; and often an Hippodromus. Hence arose these attributes, by which the Poets celebrated these personages:
[375]Καστορα θ' Ἱπποδαμον, και πυξ αγαθον Πολυδευκεα.
The Deity, originally referred to, was the Sun: As he was the chief Deity, he must necessarily have been esteemed the supervisor and arbitrator of all sublunary things:
[376]Ηελιος, ὁς παντ' εφορᾳ, και παντ' επακουει.
On this account the same province of supreme judge was conferred on his substitute Castor, in conjunction with his brother Pollux: and they were accordingly looked upon as the conservators of the rights of mankind. Cicero makes a noble appeal to them in his seventh oration against Verres; and enlarges upon the great department, of which they were presumed to be possessed: at the same time
mentioning the treasures, which were deposited in their temples. [377]Vos omnium rerum forensium, consiliorum maximorum, legum, judiciorumque arbitri, et testes, celeberrimo in loco PRÆTORII locati, Castor et Pollux; quorum ex templo quæstum sibi iste (Verres) et prædam maximam improbissime comparavit—teque, Ceres, et Libera—a quibis initia vitæ atque victûs, legum, morum, mansuetudinis, humanitatis exempla hominibus et civitatibus data ac dispertita esse dicuntur. Thus we find that they are at the close joined with Ceres, and Libera; and spoken of as the civilizers of the world: but their peculiar province was law and judicature.
Many instances to the same purpose might be produced; some few of which I will lay before the reader. Trophonius, like Chiron and Castor, was a sacred tower; being compounded of Tor-Oph-On, Solis Pythonis turris, rendered Trophon, and Trophonius. It was an oracular temple, situated near a vast cavern: and the responses were given by dreams. Tiresias, that antient prophet, was an edifice of the same nature: and the name is a compound of Tor-Ees, and Tor-Asis; from whence the Greeks formed the word Tiresias. He is generally esteemed a diviner, or soothsayer, to whom people applied for advice: but it was to the temple that they applied, and to the Deity, who was there supposed to reside. He was, moreover, said to have lived nine ages: till he was at last taken by the Epigoni, when he died. The truth is, there was a tower of this name at Thebes, built by the Amonians, and sacred to the God Orus. It stood nine ages, and was then demolished. It was afterwards repaired, and made use of for a place of augury:
and its situation was close to the temple of Amon. [378]Θηβαιοις δε μετα του Αμμωνος το Ἱερον,
οιωνοσκοπειον τε Τειρεσιου καλουμενον. Tiresias, according to Apollodorus, was the son of
Eueres, [379]Ευηρης, or, according to the true Dorian pronunciation, Euares, the same as the Egyptian
Uc Arez, the Sun. He is by Hyginus styled [380]Eurimi filius; and in another place Eurii filius, Pastor. Eurius, Eurimus, Euarez, are all names of the Sun, or places sacred to him; but changed to terms of relation by not being understood. Tiresias is additionally styled Pastor; because all the Amonian Deities, as well as their princes, were called Shepherds: and those, who came originally from Chaldea, were styled the children of Ur, or Urius.
By the same analogy we may trace the true history of Terambus, the Deity of Egypt, who was called the Shepherd Terambus. The name is a compound of Tor-Ambus, or Tor-Ambi, the oracular tower of Ham.
He is said to have been the son of Eusires, [381]Ευσειρου του Ποσειδωνος; and to have come over, and settled in Thessaly, near mount Othrys. According to Antonius Liberalis, he was very rich in flocks, and a great musician, and particularly expert in all pastoral measure. To him they attributed the invention of the pipe. The meaning of the history is, I think, too plain, after what has preceded, to need a comment. It is fabled of him, that he was at last turned into a bird called Cerambis, or Cerambix. Terambus and Cerambis are both antient terms of the same purport: the one properly expressed is TorAmbi; the other Cer-Ambi, the oracular temple of the Sun.
I have taken notice that towers of this sort were the repositories of much treasure; and they were often consecrated to the Ophite Deity, called Opis and Oupis. It is the same which Callimachus addresses by
the title of [382]Ουπι, Ανασσ' ευωπι: and of whom Cicero speaks, and styles Upis; [383]quam Græci Upim paterno nomine appellant. The temple was hence called Kir-Upis; which the Grecians abridged to



Γρυπες: and finding many of the Amonian temples in the north, with the device of a winged serpent
upon the frontal, they gave this name to the hieroglyphic. Hence, I imagine, arose the notion of Γρυπες, or Gryphons; which, like the dragons abovementioned, were supposed to be guardians of treasure, and to never sleep. The real conservators of the wealth were the priests. They kept up a perpetual fire, and an unextinguished light in the night. From Kir Upis, the place of his residence, a priest was named Grupis; and from Kir-Uph-On, Gryphon. The Poets have represented the Grupes as animals of the serpentine kind; and supposed them to have been found in countries of the Arimaspians, Alazonians, Hyperboreans, and other the most northern regions, which the Amonians possessed. In some of the temples women officiated, who were denominated from the Deity they served. The Scholiast upon Callimachus calls the chief of them Upis; and styles her, and her associates, Κορας
[384]Ὑπερβορεους, Hyperborean young women. The Hyperboreans, Alazonians, Arimaspians, were Scythic nations of the same family. All the stories about Prometheus, Chimæra, Medusa, Pegasus, Hydra, as well as of the Grupes, or Gryphons, arose, in great measure, from the sacred devices upon the entablatures of temples.
TAPH, TUPH, TAPHOS.
There was another name current among the Amonians, by which they called their λοφοι, or high places. This was Taph; which at times was rendered Tuph, Toph, and Taphos. Lower Egypt being a flat, and annually overflowed, the natives were forced to raise the soil, on which they built their principal edifices, in order to secure them from the inundation: and many of their sacred towers were erected upon conical mounds of earth. But there were often hills of the same form constructed for religious purposes, upon which there was no building. These were very common in Egypt. Hence we read of Taphanis, or Taph-Hanes, Taph-Osiris, Taph-Osiris parva, and contra Taphias, in Antoninus; all of this country. In other parts were Taphiousa, Tape, Taphura, Tapori, Taphus, Taphosus, Taphitis. All these names relate to high altars, upon which they used oftentimes to offer human sacrifices. Typhon was one of these; being a compound of Tuph-On, which signifies the hill or altar of the Sun. Tophet, where the
Israelites made their children pass through fire to [385]Moloch, was a mount of this form. And there seem to have been more than one of this denomination; as we learn from the prophet Jeremiah,
[386]They have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire. And in another place: They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal. These cruel operations were generally performed upon mounts of this sort; which, from their conical figure, were named Tuph and Tupha. It
seems to have been a term current in many countries. The high Persian [387]bonnet had the same name from its shape: and Bede mentions a particular kind of standard in his time; which was made of plumes
in a globular shape, and called in like manner, [388]Tupha, vexilli genus, ex consertis plumarum globis. There was probably a tradition, that the calf, worshipped by the Israelites in the wilderness near Horeb, was raised upon a sacred mound, like those described above: for Philo Judæus says, that it was exhibited
after the model of an Egyptian Tuphos: [389]Αιγυπτιακου μιμημα Τυφου. This I do not take to have been a Grecian word; but the name of a sacred orbicular mount, analogous to the Touphas of Persis.
The Amonians, when they settled in Greece, raised many of these Tupha, or Tapha, in different parts. These, beside their original name, were still farther denominated from some title of the Deity, to whose honour they were erected. But as it was usual, in antient times, to bury persons of distinction under heaps of earth formed in this fashion; these Tapha came to signify tombs: and almost all the sacred mounds, raised for religious purposes, were looked upon as monuments of deceased heroes. Hence
[390]Taph-Osiris was rendered ταφος, or the burying place of the God Osiris: and as there were many such places in Egypt and Arabia, sacred to Osiris and Dionusus; they were all by the Greeks esteemed places of sepulture. Through this mistake many different nations had the honour attributed to them of these Deities being interred in their country. The tumulus of the Latines was mistaken in the same manner. It was originally a sacred hillock; and was often raised before temples, as an altar; such as I have before described. It is represented in this light by Virgil:
[391]Est urbe egressis tumulus, templumque vetustum Desertæ Cereris; juxtaque antiqua cupressus.
In process of time the word tumulus was in great measure looked upon as a tomb; and tumulo signified to bury. The Greeks speak of numberless sepulchral monuments, which they have thus misinterpreted.
They pretended to shew the tomb of [392]Dionusus at Delphi; also of Deucalion, Pyrrha, Orion, in other places. They imagined that Jupiter was buried in Crete: which Callimachus supposes to have been a forgery of the natives.



[393]Κρητες αει ψευσται· και γαρ ταφον, ω Ανα, σειο Κρητες ετεκτῃναντο, συ δ' ου θανες, εσσι γαρ αιει.
I make no doubt, but that there was some high place in Crete, which the later Greeks, and especially those who were not of the country, mistook for a tomb. But it certainly must have been otherwise esteemed by those who raised it: for it is not credible, however blind idolatry may have been, that people should enshrine persons as immortal, where they had the plainest evidences of their mortality. An inscription Viro Immortali was in a style of flattery too refined for the simplicity of those ages. If divine honours were conferred, they were the effects of time, and paid at some distance; not upon the spot, at the vestibule of the charnel-house. Besides, it is evident, that most of the deified personages never existed: but were mere titles of the Deity, the Sun; as has been, in great measure, proved by Macrobius. Nor was there ever any thing of such detriment to antient history, as the supposing that the Gods of the Gentile world had been natives of the countries, where they were worshipped. They have by these means been admitted into the annals of times: and it has been the chief study of the learned to register the legendary stories concerning them; to conciliate absurdities, and to arrange the whole in a chronological series. A fruitless labour, and inexplicable: for there are in all these fables such inconsistences, and contradictions, as no art, nor industry, can remedy. Hence, all who have expended their learning to this purpose, are in opposition to one another, and often at variance with themselves. Some of them by these means have rendered their works, which might have been of infinite use to the world, little better than the reveries of Monsieur Voltaire. The greatest part of the Grecian theology arose from misconceptions and blunders: and the stories concerning their Gods and Heroes were founded on terms misinterpreted and abused. Thus from the word ταφος, taphos, which they adopted in a limited sense, they formed a notion of their gods having been buried in every place, where there was a tumulus to their honour. This misled bishop Cumberland, Usher, Pearson, Petavius, Scaliger, with numberless other learned men; and among the foremost the great Newton. This extraordinary genius has greatly impaired the excellent system, upon which he proceeded, by admitting these fancied beings into chronology. We are so imbued in our childhood with notions of Mars, Hercules, and the rest of the celestial outlaws, that we scarce ever can lay them aside. We absolutely argue upon Pagan principles: and though we cannot believe the fables, which have been transmitted to us; yet we forget ourselves continually; and make inferences from them, as if they were real. In short, till we recollect ourselves, we are semi-pagans. It gives one pain to see men of learning, and principle, debating which was the Jupiter who lay with Semele; and whether it was the same that outwitted Amphitryon. This is not, says a critic, the Hermes, who cut off Argus's head; but one of later date, who turned Battus into a stone. I fancy, says another, that this was done, when Iö was turned into a cow. It is said of Jupiter, that he made the night,
in which he enjoyed Alcmena, as long as [394]three; or, as some say, as long as nine. The Abbe
[395]Banier with some phlegm excepts to this coalition of nights; and is unwilling to allow it. But he is afterwards more complying; and seems to give it his sanction, with this proviso, that chronological verity be not thereby impeached. I am of opinion, says he, that there was no foundation for the fable of Jupiter's having made the night, on which he lay with Alcmena, longer than others: at least this event put nothing in nature out of order; since the day, which followed, was proportionably shorter, as Plautus
[396]remarks.
Atque quanto nox fuisti longior hâc proximâ, Tanto brevior dies ut fiat, faciam; ut æque disparet, Et dies e nocte accedat.
Were it not invidious, I could subjoin names to every article, which I have alleged; and produce numberless instances to the same purpose.
It may be said, that I run counter to the opinions of all antiquity: that all the fathers who treated of this subject, and many other learned men, supposed the Gods of the heathen to have been deified mortals, who were worshipped in the countries, where they died. It was the opinion of Clemens, Eusebius, Cyril, Tertullian, Athenagoras, Epiphanius, Lactantius, Arnobius, Julius Firmicus, and many others. What is more to the purpose, it was the opinion of the heathen themselves; the very people, by whom these gods were honoured: yet still it is a mistake. In respect to the fathers, the whole of their argument turns upon this point, the concessions of the Gentiles. The more early writers of the church were not making a strict chronological inquiry: but were labouring to convert the heathen. They therefore argue with them upon their own principles; and confute them from their own testimony. The Romans had their Dii Immortales; the Greeks their Θεοι Αθανατοι: yet acknowledged that they had been men; that they died, and were
buried. Cicero owns; [397]ab Euhemero et mortes, et sepulturæ demonstrantur deorum. It matters not whether the notion were true; the fathers very fairly make use of it. They avail themselves of these concessions; and prove from them the absurdity of the Gentile worship, and the inconsistency of their opinions. Even Maximus Tyrius, the Platonic, could not but smile, at being shewn in the same place the
temple, and tomb of the deity[398]; ἱερον Θεου, και ταφον Θεου. These supposed places of sepulture
were so numerous, that Clemens Alexandrinus tells us, they were not to be counted. [399]Αλλα γαρ



επιοντι μοι τους προσκυνουμενους ὑμιν ταφους, εμοι μεν ουδ' ὁ πας αν αρκεσῃ χρονος. But, after all, these Ταφοι were not tombs, but λοφοι μαστοειδεις, conical mounds of earth; on
which in the first ages offerings were made by fire. Hence τυφω, tupho, signified to make a smoke, such as arose from incense upon these Tupha, or eminences. Besides, if these were deified men, who were buried under these hills; how can we explain the difficulty of the same person being buried in different places, and at different times? To this it is answered, that it was another Bacchus, and another Jupiter. Yet this still adds to the difficulty: for it is hard to conceive, that whoever in any country had the name of Jupiter, should be made a God. Add to this, that Homer and Hesiod, and the authors of the Orphic poetry, knew of no such duplicates. There is no hint of this sort among the antient writers of their nation. It was a refinement in after ages; introduced to obviate the difficulties, which arose from the absurdities in the pagan system. Arnobius justly ridicules the idle expedients, made use of to render a base theology plausible. Gods, of the same name and character, were multiplied to make their fables consistent; that there might be always one ready at hand upon any chronological emergency. Hence no difficulty could arise about a Deity, but there might be one produced, adapted to all climes, and to every
age. [400]Aiunt Theologi vestri, et vetustatis absconditæ conditores, tres in rerum naturâ Joves essequinque Soles, et Mercurios quinque. Aiunt iidem Theologi quatuor esse Vulcanos, et tres Dianas; Æsculapios totidem, et Dionysos quinque; ter binos Hercules, et quatuor Veneres; tria genera Castorum, totidemque Musarum. But Arnobius is too modest. Other writers insist upon a greater variety. In respect
to Jupiters, Varro according to Tertullian makes them in number three hundred. [401]Varro trecentos Joves, sive Jupiteres, dicendum, —— introducit. The same writer mentions forty heroes of the name of Hercules; all which variety arose from the causes above assigned: and the like multiplicity may be found both of kings and heroes; of kings, who did not reign; of heroes, who never existed. The same may be observed in the accounts transmitted of their most early prophets, and poets: scarce any of them stand single: there are duplicates of every denomination. On this account it is highly requisite for those, who suppose these personages to have been men, and make inferences from the circumstances of their history, to declare explicitly which they mean; and to give good reasons for their determination. It is said of Jupiter, that he was the son of Saturn; and that he carried away Europa, before the arrival of Cadmus. He had afterwards an amour with Semele, the supposed daughter of Cadmus: and they mention his having a like intimacy with Alcmena an age or two later. After this he got acquainted with Leda, the wife of Tyndarus: and he had children at the siege of Troy. If we may believe the poets, and all our intelligence comes originally from the poets, Jupiter was personally interested in that war. But this interval contains little less than two hundred years. These therefore could not be the actions of one man:
on which account I want to know, why Sir Isaac Newton [402]in his chronological interpretations chooses to be determined by the story of Jupiter and Europa, rather than by that of Jupiter and Leda. The
learned [403]Pezron has pitched upon a Jupiter above one thousand years earlier, who was in like manner the son of Saturn. But Saturn, according to some of the best mythologists, was but four generations inclusive before the æra of Troy. Latinus, the son of Faunus, was alive some years after that city had
been taken; when Æneas was supposed to have arrived in Italy. The poet tells us, [404]Fauno Picus pater: isque parentem Te, Saturne, refert; Tu sanguinis ultimus auctor. The series amounts only to four, Latinus, Faunus, Picus, Saturn. What authority has Pezron for the anticipation of which he is guilty in determining the reign of Jupiter? and how can he reconcile these contradictory histories? He ought to have given some good reason for setting aside the more common and accepted accounts; and placing
these events so [405]early. Shall we suppose with the critics and commentators that this was a prior Jupiter? If it were a different person, the circumstances of his life should be different: but the person, of whom he treats, is in all respects similar to the Jupiter of Greece and Rome. He has a father Saturn; and his mother was Rhea. He was nursed in Crete; and had wars with the Titans. He dethrones his father, who flies to Italy; where he introduces an age of gold. The mythology concerning him we find to be in all respects uniform. It is therefore to little purpose to substitute another person of the same name by way of reconciling matters, unless we can suppose that every person so denominated had the same relations and connexions, and the same occurrences in life reiterated: which is impossible. It is
therefore, I think, plain, that the Grecian Deities were not the persons [406]supposed: and that their
imputed names were titles. It is true, a very antient and respectable writer, [407]Euhemerus, of whom I have before made mention, thought otherwise. It is said, that he could point out precisely, where each god departed: and could particularly shew the burying-place of Jupiter. Lactantius, who copied from
him, says, that it was at Cnossus in [408]Crete. Jupiter, ætate pessum actâ, in Cretâ vitam commutavit.Sepulchrum ejus est in Cretâ, et in oppido Cnosso: et dicitur Vesta hanc urbem creavisse: inque sepulchro ejus est inscriptio antiquis literis Græcis, Ζαν Κρονου. If Jupiter had been buried in Crete, as these writers would persuade us, the accounts would be uniform about the place where he was deposited. Lactantius, we find, and some others, say, that it was in the city Cnossus. There are writers
who mention it to have been in a cavern upon [409]Mount Ida: others upon Mount [410]Jasius. Had the Cretans been authors of the notion, they would certainly have been more consistent in their accounts: but we find no more certainty about the place of his burial, than of his birth; concerning which Callimachus could not determine.



[411]Ζευ, σε μεν Ιδαιοισιν εν ουρεσι φασι γενεσθαι, Ζευ, σε δ' εν Αρκαδιῃ.
He was at times supposed to have been a native of Troas, of Crete, of Thebes, of Arcadia, of Elis: but the whole arose from the word ταφος being, through length of time, misunderstood: for there would have been no legend about the birth of Jupiter, had there been no mistake about his funeral. It was a common notion of the Magnesians, that Jupiter was buried in their country upon Mount Sipylus. Pausanias says, that he ascended the mountain, and beheld the tomb, which was well worthy of
[412]admiration. The tomb of [413]Isis in like manner was supposed to be at Memphis, and at Philæ in Upper Egypt: also at Nusa in Arabia. Osiris was said to have been buried in the same places: likewise at
Taphosiris, which is thought by Procopius to have had its name, [414]because it was the place of sepulture of Osiris. The same is said of another city, which was near the mouth of the Nile, and called Taphosiris parva. But they each of them had their name from the worship, and not from the interment of the Deity. This is plain from the account given of the ταφος Οσιριδος, or high altar of Osiris, by
Diodorus; from whom we learn that Busiris and Osiris were the same. [415]The Grecians, says this author, have a notion, that Busiris in Egypt used to sacrifice strangers: not that there was ever such a king as Busiris; but the ταφος, or altar, of Osiris had this name in the language of the natives. In short,
Busiris was only a variation for Osiris: both were compounded of the Egyptian term [416]Sehor, and related to the God of day. Hence the altars of the same Deity were called indifferently the altars of Osiris, or Busiris, according as custom prevailed.
I have in a former chapter taken notice of the Tarchons and Dracontia in Syria, and other parts: which consisted of sacred ground inclosed with a wall, and an altar or two at the upper part. Such an inclosure is described by Pausanias, which must have been of great antiquity: hence the history of it was very
imperfectly known in his time. He is speaking of Nemea in Argolis; [417]near which, says he, stands the temple of Nemean Jupiter, a structure truly wonderful, though the roof is now fallen in. Round the temple is a grove of cypress; in which there is a tradition that Opheltes was left by his nurse upon the grass, and in her absence killed by a serpent.—In the same place is the tomb of Opheltes, surrounded with a wall of stone; and within the inclosure altars. There is also a mound of earth said to be the tomb of Lycurgus, the father of Opheltes. Lycurgus is the same as Lycus, Lycaon, Lycoreus, the Sun: and
Opheltes, his supposed offspring, is of the same purport. To say the truth, [418]Opheltes, or, as it should be expressed, Ophel-tin is the place; and Ophel the Deity, Sol Pytho, whose symbol was a serpent. Ophel-tin was a Taphos with a τεμενος, or sacred inclosure: it was a sacred mound to the Ophite Deity;
like that which was inclosed and fortified by [419]Manasseh king of Judah; and which had been
previously made use of to the same purpose by [420]Jotham. A history similar to that of Opheltes is given of Archemorus; who was said to have been left in a garden by his nurse Hypsipyle, and in her absence slain by a serpent. Each of them had festivals instituted, together with sacred games, in memorial of their misfortune. They are on this account by many supposed to have been the same person. But in reality they were not persons, but places. They are, however, so far alike, as they are terms which relate to the same worship and Deity. Opheltin is the place, and altar of the Ophite God abovementioned: and Archemorus was undoubtedly the antient name of the neighbouring town, or city. It is a compound of Ar-Chemorus; and signifies the city of Cham-Orus, the same who is styled Ophel. In many of these places there was an antient tradition of some person having been injured by a serpent in the beginning of life; which they have represented as the state of childhood. The mythology upon this occasion is different: for sometimes the personages spoken of are killed by the serpent: at other times they kill it: and there are instances where both histories are told of the same person. But whatever may have been the consequence, the history is generally made to refer to a state of childhood. Hercules has accordingly a conflict with two serpents in his cradle: and Apollo, who was the same as Python, was made to engage a serpent of this name at Parnassus, when he was a child;
[421]Κουρος, εων, ΕΤΙ ΓYΜΝΟΣ, ετι πλοκαμοισι γεγηθως.
Near mount Cyllene in Arcadia was the sacred Taphos of [422]Æputus, who was supposed to have been stung by a serpent. Æputus was the same as Iapetus, the father of mankind. In the Dionusiaca the priests
used to be crowned with serpents; and in their frantic exclamations to cry out [423]Eva, Eva; and sometimes Evan, Evan: all which related to some history of a serpent. Apollo, who is supposed by most to have been victor in his conflict with the Pytho, is by Porphyry said to have been slain by that serpent:
Pythagoras affirmed, that he saw his tomb at Tripos in [424]Delphi; and wrote there an epitaph to his honour. The name of Tripos is said to have been given to the place, because the daughters of Triopus used to lament there the fate of Apollo. But Apollo and the Python were the same; and Tripus, or Triopus, the supposed father of these humane sisters, was a variation for Tor-Opus, the serpent-hill, or temple; where neither Apollo, nor the Python were slain, but where they were both worshipped, being one and the same Deity. [425]Πυθοι μεν ουν ὁ Δρακων ὁ Πυθιος θρησκευεται, και του Οφεως ἡ



πανηγυρις καταγγελλεται Πυθια. At Python (the same as Delphi) the Pythian Dragon is worshipped; and the celebrity of the serpent is styled Pythian. The daughters of Triopus were the priestesses of the temple; whose business it was to chant hymns in memory of the serpent: and what is
very remarkable, the festival was originally observed upon the seventh [426]day.
The Greeks had innumerable monuments of the sort, which I have been describing. They were taken for the tombs of departed heroes, but were really consecrated places: and the names by which they were
distinguished, shew plainly their true history. Such was the supposed tomb of [427]Orion at Tanagra, and
of Phoroneus in [428]Argolis; the tomb of [429]Deucalion in Athens; and of his wife [430]Pyrrha in
Locris: of [431]Endymion in Elis: of Tityus in [432]Panopea: of Asterion in the island [433]Lade: of the
Egyptian [434]Belus in Achaia. To these may be added the tombs of Zeus in Mount Sipylus, Mount Iasius, and Ida: the tombs of Osiris in various parts: and those of Isis, which have been enumerated before. Near the Æaceum at Epidaurus was a hill, reputed to have been the tomb of the hero
[435]Phocus. This Æaceum was an inclosure planted with olive trees of great antiquity; and at a small degree above the surface of the ground was an altar sacred to Æacus. To divulge the traditions relative to this altar would, it seems, be an high profanation. The author, therefore, keeps them a secret. Just before this sacred septum was the supposed tomb of Phocus, consisting of a mound of raised earth, fenced round with a border of stone work: and a large rough stone was placed upon the top of all. Such were the rude monuments of Greece, which were looked upon as so many receptacles of the dead: but were high altars, with their sacred τεμενη, which had been erected for divine worship in the most early
times. The Helladians, and the Persians, were of the same [436]family: hence we find many similar rites subsisting among the two nations. The latter adhered to the purer Zabaïsm, which they maintained a long time. They erected the same sacred Tupha, as the Grecians: and we may be assured of the original purpose, for which these hills were raised, from the use to which they put them. They were dedicated to the great fountain of light, called by the Persians, Anaït: and were set apart as Puratheia, for the celebration of the rites of fire. This people, after they had defeated the Sacæ in Cappadocia, raised an
immense Comah in memorial of their victory. [437]Strabo, who describes it very minutely, tells us, that they chose a spot in an open plain; where they reared a Petra, or high place, by heaping up a vast mound of earth. This they fashioned to a conical figure; and then surrounded it with a wall of stone. In this manner they founded a kind of temple in honour of Anaït, Omanus, and Anandrates, the Deities of their country. I have mentioned that the Egyptians had hills of this nature: and from them the custom was transmitted to Greece. Typhon, or more properly Tuphon, Τυφων, who was supposed to have been a
giant, was a compound of Tuph-On, as I have before mentioned; and signified a sacred [438]mount of the sun. Those cities in Egypt, which had a high place of this sort, and rites in consequence of it, were styled Typhonian. Upon such as these they sacrificed red haired men, or men with hair of a light colour; in other words strangers. For both the sons of Chus, and the Mizraïm were particularly dark and woolly: so that there could be no surer mark than the hair to distinguish between a native and a foreigner. These
sacrifices were offered in the city [439]Idithia, [440]Abaris, [441]Heliopolis, and Taphosiris; which in consequence of these offerings were denominated Typhonian cities. Many writers say, that these rites
were performed to Typhon at the [442]tomb of Osiris. Hence he was in later times supposed to have been
a person, one of immense size: and he was also esteemed a [443]God. But this arose from the common mistake by which places were substituted for the Deities there worshipped. Typhon was the Tupha, or altar, the supposed tomb of the God: and the offerings were made to the Sun, styled On; the same as Osiris, and Busiris. As there were Typhonian mounts in many parts, he was in consequence of it supposed to have been buried in different places: near mount Caucasus in Colchis; near the river Orontes in Syria; and under lake Serbonis. Typhon, or rather Typhonian worship, was not unknown in
the region of [444]Troas, near which were the Scopuli Typhonis. Plutarch mentions that in the Phrygian Theology Typhon was esteemed the grandson of Isaac or Isæac: and says that he was so spoken of εν
τοις Φρυγιοις [445]γραμμασιν. But all terms of relation are to be disregarded. The purport of the
history was this. The altar was termed Tuphon Isiac, sive Βωμος Ισιακος, from the sacra Isiaca, which were performed upon it. The same Isaac or Isæac was sometimes rendered Æsacus, and supposed to have been a son of the river Granicus.
[446]Æsacon umbrosâ furtim peperisse sub Idâ Fertur Alexirhoë Granico nata bicorni.
The antient Arcadians were said to have been the offspring of [447]Typhon, and by some the children of Atlas; by which was meant, that they were people of the Typhonian, and Atlantian religion. What they called his tombs were certainly mounds of earth, raised very high, like those which have been mentioned before: only with this difference, that some of these had lofty towers adorned with pinnacles, and battlements. They had also carved upon them various symbols; and particularly serpentine hieroglyphics, in memorial of the God to whom they were sacred. In their upper story was a perpetual fire, which was plainly seen in the night. I have mentioned, that the poets formed their notions about



Otus and Ephialtes from towers: and the idea of Orion's stupendous bulk taken from the Pelorian edifice in Sicily. The gigantic stature of Typhon was borrowed from a like object: and his character was formed from the hieroglyphical representations in the temples styled Typhonian. This may be inferred from the allegorical description of Typhœus, given by Hesiod. Typhon and Typhœus, were the same personage: and the poet represents him of a mixed form, being partly a man, and partly a monstrous dragon, whose head consisted of an assemblage of smaller serpents.
[448]Εκ δε ὁι ωμων Ην ἑκατον κεφαλαι οφιος, δεινοιο Δρακοντος.
As there was a perpetual fire kept up in the upper story, he describes it as shining through the apertures in the building.
[449]Εκ δε ὁι οσσων Θεσπεσιῃς κεφαλῃσιν ὑπ' οφρυσι πυρ αμαρυσσε· Πασεων δ' εκ κεφαλεων πυρ καιετο δερκομενοιο.
But the noblest description of Typhon is given in some very fine poetry by Nonnus. He has taken his ideas from some antient tower situated near the sea upon the summit of an high mountain. It was probably the Typhonian temple of Zeus upon mount Casius, near the famed Serbonian lake. He mentions sad noises heard within, and describes the roaring of the surge below: and says that all the monsters of the sea stabled in the cavities at the foot of the mountain, which was washed by the ocean.
[450]Εν ιχθυοεντι δε ποντῳ Ἱσταμενου Τυφωνος εσω βρυοεντος εναυλου Βενθεϊ ταρσα πεπηκτο, και ηερι μιγνυτο γαστηρ Θλιβομενη νεφεεσσι· Γιγαντειου δε καρηνου Φρικτον αερσιλοφων αϊων βρυχημα λεοντων, Ποντιος ειλυοεντι λεων εκαλυπτετο κολπῳ. κτλ.
We may perceive, that this is a mixed description, wherein, under the character of a gigantic personage, a towering edifice is alluded to; which was situated upon the summit of a mountain, and in the vicinity of the sea.

Παρα παντι των νομιζομενων παρ' ὑμιν Θεων Οφις συμβολον μεγα και μυστηριον αναγραφεται. Justin. Martyr. Apolog. l. 1. p. 60.
It may seem extraordinary, that the worship of the serpent should have ever been introduced into the world: and it must appear still more remarkable, that it should almost universally have prevailed. As mankind are said to have been ruined through the influence of this being, we could little expect that it would, of all other objects, have been adopted, as the most sacred and salutary symbol; and rendered the
chief object of [451]adoration. Yet so we find it to have been. In most of the antient rites there is some
allusion to the [452]serpent. I have taken notice, that in the Orgies of Bacchus, the persons who partook of the ceremony used to carry serpents in their hands, and with horrid screams called upon Eva, Eva.
They were often crowned with [453]serpents, and still made the same frantic exclamation. One part of the mysterious rites of Jupiter Sabazius was to let a snake slip down the bosom of the person to be
initiated, which was taken out below[454]. These ceremonies, and this symbolic worship, began among the Magi, who were the sons of Chus: and by them they were propagated in various parts. Epiphanius
thinks, that the invocation, Eva, Eva, related to the great [455]mother of mankind, who was deceived by the serpent: and Clemens of Alexandria is of the same opinion. He supposes, that by this term was meant [456]Ευαν εκεινην, δι' ἡν ἡ πλανη παρηκολουθησε. But I should think, that Eva was the
same as Eph, Epha, Opha, which the Greeks rendered Οφις, Ophis, and by it denoted a serpent.
Clemens acknowledges, that the term Eva properly aspirated had such a signification. [457]Το ονομα



το Ευια δασυνομενον ἑρμηνευεται Οφις. Olympias, the mother of [458]Alexander, was very fond of these Orgies, in which the serpent was introduced. Plutarch mentions, that rites of this sort were practised by the Edonian women near mount Hæmus in Thrace; and carried on to a degree of madness. Olympias copied them closely in all their frantic manœuvres. She used to be followed with many
attendants, who had each a thyrsus with [459]serpents twined round it. They had also snakes in their hair, and in the chaplets, which they wore; so that they made a most fearful appearance. Their cries were very
shocking: and the whole was attended with a continual repetition of the words, [460]Evoe, Saboe, Hues Attes, Attes Hues, which were titles of the God Dionusus. He was peculiarly named Ὑης; and his
priests were the Hyades, and Hyantes. He was likewise styled Evas. [461]Ευας ὁ Διονυσος.
In Egypt was a serpent named Thermuthis, which was looked upon as very sacred; and the natives are
said to have made use of it as a royal tiara, with which they ornamented the statues of [462]Isis. We learn from Diodorus Siculus, that the kings of Egypt wore high bonnets, which terminated in a round ball:
and the whole was surrounded with figures of [463]asps. The priests likewise upon their bonnets had the representation of serpents. The antients had a notion, that when Saturn devoured his own children, his wife Ops deceived him by substituting a large stone in lieu of one of his sons, which stone was called Abadir. But Ops, and Opis, represented here as a feminine, was the serpent Deity, and Abadir is the
same personage under a different denomination. [464]Abadir Deus est; et hoc nomine lapis ille, quem Saturnus dicitur devorâsse pro Jove, quem Græci βαιτυλον vocant.—Abdir quoque et Abadir
βαιτυλος. Abadir seems to be a variation of Ob-Adur, and signifies the serpent God Orus. One of these stones, which Saturn was supposed to have swallowed instead of a child, stood, according to
[465]Pausanias, at Delphi. It was esteemed very sacred, and used to have libations of wine poured upon it daily; and upon festivals was otherwise honoured. The purport of the above history I imagine to have been this. It was for a long time a custom to offer children at the altar of Saturn: but in process of time they removed it, and in its room erected a στυλος, or stone pillar; before which they made their vows, and offered sacrifices of another nature. This stone, which they thus substituted, was called Ab-Adar,
from the Deity represented by it. The term Ab generally signifies a [466]father: but, in this instance, it
certainly relates to a serpent, which was indifferently styled Ab, Aub, and [467]Ob. I take Abadon, or, as it is mentioned in the Revelations, Abaddon, to have been the name of the same Ophite God, with
whose worship the world had been so long infected. He is termed by the Evangelist [468]Αβαδδων, τον
Αγγελον της Αβυσσου, the angel of the bottomless pit; that is, the prince of darkness. In another
place he is described as the [469]dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and Satan. Hence I think, that the learned Heinsius is very right in the opinion, which he has given upon this passage; when he makes Abaddon the same as the serpent Pytho. Non dubitandum est, quin Pythius Apollo, hoc est spurcus ille spiritus, quem Hebræi Ob, et Abaddon, Hellenistæ ad verbum Απολλυωνα, cæteri
Απολλωνα, dixerunt, sub hâc formâ, quâ miseriam humano generi invexit, primo cultus[470].



Ophis Thermuthis, sive Ob Basiliscus Ægyptiacus cum Sacerdote Supplicante.
Pl. VII.
It is said, that, in the ritual of Zoroaster, the great expanse of the heavens, and even nature itself, was
described under the symbol of a serpent[471]. The like was mentioned in the Octateuch of Ostanes: and moreover, that in Persis and in other parts of the east they erected temples to the serpent tribe, and held festivals to their honour, esteeming them [472]Θεους τους μεγιστους, και αρχηγους των ὁλων, the supreme of all Gods, and the superintendants of the whole world. The worship began among the people
of Chaldea. They built the city Opis upon the [473]Tigris, and were greatly addicted to divination, and to
the worship of the serpent[474]. Inventi sunt ex iis (Chaldeis) augures, et magi, divinatores, et sortilegi, et inquirentes Ob, et Ideoni. From Chaldea the worship passed into Egypt, where the serpent Deity was called Can-oph, Can-eph, and C'neph. It had also the name of Ob, or Oub, and was the same as the Basiliscus, or Royal Serpent; the same also as the Thermuthis: and in like manner was made use of by



way of ornament to the statues of their [475]Gods. The chief Deity of Egypt is said to have been Vulcan,
who was also styled Opas, as we learn from [476]Cicero. He was the same as Osiris, the Sun; and hence was often called Ob-El, sive Pytho Sol: and there were pillars sacred to him with curious hieroglyphical inscriptions, which had the same name. They were very lofty, and narrow in comparison of their length; hence among the Greeks, who copied from the Egyptians, every thing gradually tapering to a point was styled Obelos, and Obeliscus. Ophel (Oph-El) was a name of the same purport: and I have shewn, that many sacred mounds, or Tapha, were thus denominated from the serpent Deity, to whom they were sacred.
Sanchoniathon makes mention of an history, which he once wrote upon the worship of the serpent. The
title of this work, according to Eusebius was, [477]Ethothion, or Ethothia. Another treatise upon the same subject was written by Pherecydes Syrus, which was probably a copy of the former; for he is said
to have composed it, [478]παρα Φοινικων λαβων τας αφορμας, from some previous accounts of the Phenicians. The title of his book was the Theology of Ophion, styled Ophioneus; and of his worshippers, called Ophionidæ. Thoth, and Athoth, were certainly titles of the Deity in the Gentile world: and the book of Sanchoniathon might very possibly have been from hence named Ethothion, or more truly Athothion. But from the subject, upon which it was written, as well as from the treatise of Pherecydes, I should think, that Athothion, or Ethothion, was a mistake for Ath-ophion, a title which more immediately related to that worship, of which the writer treated. Ath was a sacred title, as I have shewn: and I imagine, that this dissertation did not barely relate to the serpentine Deity; but contained accounts of his votaries, the Ophitæ, the principal of which were the sons of Chus. The worship of the Serpent began among them; and they were from thence denominated Ethopians, and Aithopians, which the Greeks rendered Αιθιοπες. It was a name, which they did not receive from their complexion, as has been commonly surmised; for the branch of Phut, and the Lubim, were probably of a deeper die: but they were so called from Ath-Ope, and Ath-Opis, the God which they worshipped. This may be proved from Pliny. He says that the country Æthiopia (and consequently the people) had the name of Æthiop
from a personage who was a Deity—ab [479]Æthiope Vulcani filio. The Æthiopes brought these rites
into Greece: and called the island, where they first established them, [480]Ellopia, Solis Serpentis insula. It was the same as Eubœa, a name of the like purport; in which island was a region named Æthiopium. Eubœa is properly Oub-Aia; and signifies the Serpent Island. The same worship prevailed among the Hyperboreans, as we may judge from the names of the sacred women, who used to come annually to Delos. They were priestesses of the Tauric Goddess, and were denominated from her titles.
[481]Ουπις τε, Λοξω τε, και Ευαιων Ἑκαεργη.
Hercules was esteemed the chief God, the same as Chronus; and was said to have produced the
Mundane egg. He was represented in the Orphic Theology under the mixed symbol of a [482]lion and
serpent: and sometimes of a [483]serpent only. I have before mentioned, that the Cuthites under the title of Heliadæ settled at Rhodes: and, as they were Hivites or Ophites, that the island in consequence of it
was of old named Ophiusa. There was likewise a tradition, that it had once swarmed with [484]serpents. The like notion prevailed almost in every place, where they settled. They came under the more general titles of Leleges and Pelasgi: but more particularly of Elopians, Europians, Oropians, Asopians, Inopians, Ophionians, and Æthiopes, as appears from the names, which they bequeathed; and in most places, where they resided, there were handed down traditions, which alluded to their original title of Ophites. In Phrygia, and upon the Hellespont, whither they sent out colonies very early, was a people styled Οφιογενεις, or the serpent-breed; who were said to retain an affinity and correspondence with
[485]serpents. And a notion prevailed, that some hero, who had conducted them, was changed from a serpent to a man. In Colchis was a river Ophis; and there was another of the same name in Arcadia. It was so named from a body of people, who settled upon its banks, and were said to have been conducted
by a serpent: [486]Τον ἡγεμονα γενεσθαι δρακοντα. These reptiles are seldom found in islands, yet
Tenos, one of the Cyclades, was supposed to have once swarmed with them. [487]Εν τῃ Τηνῳ, μιᾳ των Κυκλαδων νησῳ, οφεις και σκορπιοι δεινοι εγινοντο. Thucydides mentions a people of
Ætolia called [488]Ophionians: and the temple of Apollo at Patara in Lycia seems to have had its first
institution from a priestess of the same [489]name. The island of Cyprus was styled Ophiusa, and
Ophiodes, from the serpents, with which it was supposed to have [490]abounded. Of what species they
were is no where mentioned; excepting only that about Paphos there was said to have been a [491]kind of serpent with two legs. By this is meant the Ophite race, who came from Egypt, and from Syria, and
got footing in this [492]island. They settled also in Crete, where they increased greatly in numbers; so
that Minos was said by an unseemly allegory, [493]οφεις ουρησαι, serpentes minxisse. The island
Seriphus was one vast rock, by the Romans called [494]saxum seriphium; and made use of as a larger kind of prison for banished persons. It is represented as having once abounded with serpents; and it is styled by Virgil serpentifera, as the passage is happily corrected by Scaliger.



[495]Æginamque simul, serpentiferamque Seriphon.
It had this epithet not on account of any real serpents, but according to the Greeks from [496]Medusa's head, which was brought hither by Perseus. By this is meant the serpent Deity, whose worship was here introduced by people called Peresians. Medusa's head denoted divine wisdom: and the island was sacred
to the serpent as is apparent from its name[497]. The Athenians were esteemed Serpentigenæ; and they
had a tradition, that the chief guardian of their Acropolis was a [498]serpent. It is reported of the
Goddess Ceres, that she placed a dragon for a guardian to her temple at [499]Eleusis; and appointed
another to attend upon Erectheus. Ægeus of Athens, according to Androtion, was of the [500]serpent
breed: and the first king of the country is said to have been [501]Δρακων, a Dragon. Others make
Cecrops the first who reigned. He is said to have been [502]διφυης, of a twofold nature; συμφυες
εχων σωμα ανδρος και δρακοντος, being formed with the body of a man blended with that of a serpent. Diodorus says, that this was a circumstance deemed by the Athenians inexplicable: yet he
labours to explain it, by representing Cecrops, as half a man, and half a [503]brute; because he had been of two different communities. Eustathius likewise tries to solve it nearly upon the same principles, and
with the like success. Some had mentioned of Cecrops, that he underwent a metamorphosis, [504]απο
οφεως εις ανθρωπον ελθειν, that he was changed from a serpent to a man. By this was signified according to Eustathius, that Cecrops, by coming into Hellas, divested himself of all the rudeness and
barbarity of his [505]country, and became more civilized and humane. This is too high a compliment to be payed to Greece in its infant state, and detracts greatly from the character of the Egyptians. The
learned Marsham therefore animadverts with great justice. [506]Est verisimilius ilium ex Ægypto mores magis civiles in Græciam induxisse. It is more probable, that he introduced into Greece, the urbanity of his own country, than that he was beholden to Greece for any thing from thence. In respect to the mixed character of this personage, we may, I think, easily account for it. Cecrops was certainly a title of the
Deity, who was worshipped under this [507]emblem. Something of the like nature was mentioned of
Triptolemus, and [508]Ericthonius: and the like has been said above of Hercules. The natives of Thebes in Bœotia, like the Athenians above, esteemed themselves of the serpent race. The Lacedæmonians likewise referred themselves to the same original. Their city is said of old to have swarmed with
[509]serpents. The same is said of the city Amyclæ in Italy, which was of Spartan original. They came
hither in such abundance, that it was abandoned by the [510]inhabitants. Argos was infested in the same manner, till Apis came from Egypt, and settled in that city. He was a prophet, the reputed son of Apollo, and a person of great skill and sagacity. To him they attributed the blessing of having their country freed from this evil.
[511]Απις γαρ ελθων εκ περας Ναυπακτιας, Ιατρομαντις, παις Απολλωνος, χθονα Την δ' εκκαθαιρει κνωδαλον βροτοφθορων.
Thus the Argives gave the credit to this imaginary personage of clearing their land of this grievance: but the brood came from the very quarter from whence Apis was supposed to have arrived. They were certainly Hivites from Egypt: and the same story is told of that country. It is represented as having been of old over-run with serpents; and almost depopulated through their numbers. Diodorus Siculus seems
to understand this [512]literally: but a region, which was annually overflowed, and that too for so long a season, could not well be liable to such a calamity. They were serpents of another nature, with which it was thus infested: and the history relates to the Cuthites, the original Ophitæ, who for a long time possessed that country. They passed from Egypt to Syria, and to the Euphrates: and mention is made of a particular breed of serpents upon that river, which were harmless to the natives, but fatal to every body
else. [513]This, I think, cannot be understood literally. The wisdom of the serpent may be great; but not
sufficient to make these distinctions. These serpents were of the same nature as the [514]birds of Diomedes, and the dogs in the temple of Vulcan: and these histories relate to Ophite priests, who used to spare their own people, and sacrifice strangers, a custom which prevailed at one time in most parts of the world. I have mentioned that the Cuthite priests were very learned: and as they were Ophites, whoever had the advantage of their information, was said to have been instructed by serpents. Hence there was a tradition, that Melampus was rendered prophetic from a communication with these
[515]animals. Something similar is said of Tiresias.
As the worship of the serpent was of old so prevalent, many places, as well as people from thence, received their names. Those who settled in Campania were called Opici; which some would have
changed to Ophici; because they were denominated from serpents. [516]Οι δε (φασιν) ὁτι Οφικοι απο
των οφιων. But they are, in reality, both names of the same purport, and denote the origin of the people. We meet with places called Opis, Ophis, Ophitæa, Ophionia, Ophioëssa, Ophiodes, and Ophiusa. This last was an antient name, by which, according to Stephanus, the islands Rhodes, Cythnus,



Besbicus, Tenos, and the whole continent of Africa, were distinguished. There were also cities so called. Add to these places denominated Oboth, Obona, and reversed Onoba, from Ob, which was of the same purport. Clemens Alexandrinus says, that the term Eva signified a serpent, if pronounced with a proper
[517]aspirate. We find that there were places of this name. There was a city Eva in [518]Arcadia: and
another in [519]Macedonia. There was also a mountain Eva, or Evan, taken notice of by [520]Pausanias,
between which and Ithome lay the city Messene. He mentions also an Eva in [521]Argolis, and speaks of it as a large town. Another name for a serpent, of which I have as yet taken no notice, was Patan, or Pitan. Many places in different parts were denominated from this term. Among others was a city in
[522]Laconia; and another in [523]Mysia, which Stephanus styles a city of Æolia. They were undoubtedly so named from the worship of the serpent, Pitan: and had probably Dracontia, where were figures and devices relative to the religion which prevailed. Ovid mentions the latter city, and has some allusions to its antient history, when he describes Medea as flying through the air from Attica to Colchis.
[524]Æoliam Pitanem lævâ de parte relinquit, Factaque de saxo longi simulacra Draconis.



Pl. VIII.
The city was situated upon the river Eva or Evan, which the Greeks rendered [525]Evenus. It is remarkable, that the Opici, who are said to have been denominated from serpents, had also the name of
Pitanatæ: at least one part of that family were so called. [526]Τινας δε και Πιτανατας λεγεσθαι. Pitanatæ is a term of the same purport as Opici, and relates to the votaries of Pitan, the serpent Deity, which was adored by that people.
Menelaus was of old styled [527]Pitanates, as we learn from Hesychius: and the reason of it may be known from his being a Spartan, by which was intimated one of the serpentigenæ, or Ophites. Hence he was represented with a serpent for a device upon his shield. It is said that a brigade, or portion of
infantry, was among some of the Greeks named [528]Pitanates; and the soldiers, in consequence of it, must have been termed Pitanatæ: undoubtedly, because they had the Pitan, or serpent, for their
[529]standard. Analogous to this, among other nations, there were soldiers called [530]Draconarii. I believe, that in most countries the military standard was an emblem of the Deity there worshipped.
From what has been said, I hope, that I have thrown some light upon the history of this primitive idolatry: and have moreover shewn, that wherever any of these Ophite colonies settled they left behind from their rites and institutes, as well as from the names, which they bequeathed to places, ample memorials, by which they may be clearly traced out. It may seem strange, that in the first ages there should have been such an universal defection from the truth; and above all things such a propensity to this particular mode of worship, this mysterious attachment to the serpent. What is scarce credible, it obtained among Christians; and one of the most early heresies in the church was of this sort, introduced
by a sect, called by [531]Epiphanius Ophitæ, by [532]Clemens of Alexandria Ophiani. They are
particularly described by Tertullian, whose account of them is well worth our notice. [533]Accesserunt his Hæretici etiam illi, qui Ophitæ nuncupantur: nam serpentem magnificant in tantum, ut illum etiam ipsi Christo præferant. Ipse enim, inquiunt, scientiæ nobis boni et mali originem dedit. Hujus animadvertens potentiam et majestatem Moyses æreum posuit serpentem: et quicunque in eum aspexerunt, sanitatem consecuti sunt. Ipse, aiunt, præterea in Evangelio imitatur serpentis ipsius sacram potestatem, dicendo, et sicut Moyses exaltavit serpentem in deserto, ita exaltari oportet filium hominis. Ipsum introducunt ad benedicenda Eucharistia sua. In the above we see plainly the perverseness of human wit, which deviates so industriously; and is ever after employed in finding expedients to countenance error, and render apostasy plausible. It would be a noble undertaking, and very edifying in its consequences, if some person of true learning, and a deep insight into antiquity, would go through
with the history of the [534]serpent. I have adopted it, as far as it relates to my system, which is, in some degree, illustrated by it.
CUCLOPES CYCLOPES.
Παλαιοτατοι μεν λεγονται εν μερει τινι της χωρας (της Σικελιας) Κυκλωπες, και Λαιστρυγονες οικησαι· ὡν εγω ουτε γενος εχω ειπειν, ουτε ὁποθεν εισηλθον, η ὁποι απεχωρησαν. Thucydides. l. 6. p. 378.
Thucydides acquaints us concerning the Cyclopes and Læstrygones, that they were the most antient inhabitants of Sicily, but that he could not find out their race: nor did he know from what part of the world they originally came, nor to what country they afterwards betook themselves. I may appear presumptuous in pretending to determine a history so remote and obscure; and which was a secret to this learned Grecian two thousand years ago. Yet this is my present purpose: and I undertake it with a greater confidence, as I can plainly shew, that we have many lights, with which the natives of Hellas were unacquainted; besides many advantages, of which they would not avail themselves.
The gigantic Cyclopes were originally Ophitæ, who worshipped the symbolical serpent. They have been
represented by the poets, as persons of an enormous [535]stature, rude and savage in their demeanour, and differing from the rest of mankind in countenance. They are described as having only one large eye; which is said to have been placed, contrary to the usual situation of that organ, in the middle of their foreheads. Their place of residence was upon mount Ætna, and in the adjacent district at the foot of that
[536]mountain, which was the original region styled Trinacia. This is the common account, as it has been transmitted by the Poets, as well as by the principal mythologists of Greece: and in this we have been taught to acquiesce. But the real history is not so obvious and superficial. There are accounts of them to be obtained, that differ much from the representations which are commonly exhibited. The Poets have given a mixed description: and in lieu of the Deity of the place have introduced these strange personages, the ideas of whose size were borrowed from sacred edifices, where the Deity was



worshipped. They were Petra, or temples of Cœlus; of the same nature and form as the tower of Orion,
which was at no great distance from them. Some of them had the name of [537]Charon, and Tarchon: and they were esteemed Pelorian, from the God Alorus, the same as Cœlus and Python. The Grecians confounded the people, who raised these buildings, with the structures themselves. Strabo places them
near [538]Ætna, and Leontina: and supposes, that they once ruled over that part of the island. And it is
certain that a people styled Cyclopians did possess that [539]province. Polyphemus is imagined to have been the chief of this people: and Euripides describes the place of his residence as towards the foot of
the mountain: [540]Οικεις ὑπ' Αιτνῃ τῃ πυροστακτῳ Πετρᾳ. They are represented as a people savage, and lawless, and delighting in human flesh. Hence it is prophesied by Cassandra, as a curse
upon Ulysses, that he would one day be forced to seek for refuge in a Cyclopian [541]mansion. And when he arrives under the roof of Polyphemus, and makes inquiry about his host, and particularly upon
what he fed; he is told, that the Cyclops above all things esteemed the flesh of strangers. [542]Chance never throws any body upon this coast, says Silenus, but he is made a meal of; and it is looked upon as a delicious repast. This character of the Cyclopians arose from the cruel custom of sacrificing strangers, whom fortune brought upon their coast. This was practised in many parts of the world, but especially here, and upon the coast of the Lamii in Italy; and among all the Scythic nations upon the Euxine sea: into all which regions it was introduced from Egypt and Canaan.
But we must not consider the Cyclopians in this partial light: nor look for them only in the island of Sicily, to which they have been by the Poets confined. Memorials of them are to be found in many parts of Greece, where they were recorded as far superior to the natives in science and ingenuity. The Grecians, by not distinguishing between the Deity, and the people, who were called by his titles, have brought great confusion upon this history. The Cyclopians were denominated from Κυκλωψ, Cyclops,
the same as Cœlus. According to Parmeno Byzantinus, he was the God [543]Nilus of Egypt, who was the
same as [544]Zeus, and Osiris. The history both of the Deity, and of the people, became in time obsolete: and it has been rendered more obscure by the mixed manner in which it has been represented by the Poets.
It is generally agreed by writers upon the subject, that the Cyclopians were of a size superior to the common race of mankind. Among the many tribes of the Amonians, which went abroad, were to be
found people, who were styled [545]Anakim, and were descended from the sons of Anac: so that this history, though carried to a great excess, was probably founded in truth. They were particularly famous
for architecture; which they introduced into Greece, as we are told by [546]Herodotus: and in all parts, whither they came, they erected noble structures, which were remarkable for their height and beauty: and were often dedicated to the chief Deity, the Sun, under the name of Elorus, and P'elorus. People were so struck with their grandeur, that they called every thing great and stupendous, Pelorian. And when they described the Cyclopians as a lofty towering race, they came at last to borrow their ideas of this people from the towers, to which they alluded. They supposed them in height to reach to the clouds; and in bulk to equal the promontories, on which they were founded. Homer says of Polyphemus,
[547]Και γαρ θαυμ' ετετυκτο πελωριον, ουδε εῳκει Ανδρι γε σιτοφαγῳ, αλλα ῥιῳ ὑληεντι.
Virgil says of the same person,
[548]Ipse arduus, altaque pulsat sidera.
As these buildings were oftentimes light-houses, and had in their upper story one round casement, Argolici clypeï, aut Phœbeæ lampadis instar, by which they afforded light in the night-season; the Greeks made this a characteristic of the people. They supposed this aperture to have been an eye, which was fiery, and glaring, and placed in the middle of their foreheads. Hence Callimachus describes them as a monstrous race:
[549]αινα Πελωρα, Πρηοσιν Οσσειοισιν εοικοτα· πασι δ' ὑπ' οφρυν Φαεα μουνογληνα σακει ισα τετραβοειῳ.
The Grecians have so confounded the Cyclopian Deity with his votaries, that it is difficult to speak precisely of either. They sometimes mention him as a single person; the same as Nilus of Egypt, who was esteemed the father of the Gods. At other times they introduce a plurality, whom they still represent
as of the highest antiquity, and make the brethren of Cronus: [550]Κυκλωπες—ὁι αδελφοι ησαν του
Κρονου, του πατρος του Διος. Proclus in Photius informs us, that, according to the antient mythology of the Auctores Cyclici, the giants with an hundred hands, and the Cyclopes, were the first
born of the [551]Earth and Cœlus. But in these histories every degree of relation has been founded upon



idle surmises: and is uniformly to be set aside. The Cyclopian Deity was [552]Ouranus, and the Cyclopians were his priests and votaries: some of whom had divine honours paid to them, and were esteemed as Gods. Upon the Isthmus of Corinth was an antient temple; which seems to have been little
more than a ταφος or high altar, where offerings were made to the Cyclopian [553]Deities. People of this family settled upon the southern coast of Sicily at Camarina; which some have supposed to have been the Hupereia of Homer, where the Pheacians once resided.
[554]Ὁι πριν μεν ποτ' εναιον εν ευρυχορῳ Ὑπερειᾳ, Αγχου Κυκλωπων ανδρων ὑπερηνορεοντων.
But there is no reason to think, that the city Hupereia was in Sicily; or that the Pheacians came from that country. The notion arose from a common mistake. All the Greek and Roman Poets, and even Strabo, with other respectable writers, have taken it for granted, that the Cyclopians of Homer were near Ætna in Sicily. Others except to their being near Ætna; and insist, that they were in the vicinity of Eryx upon the opposite part of the island. But Homer does not once mention the island during his whole account of the Cyclopes: nor does Ulysses arrive in Sicily, till after many subsequent adventures. That there were Cyclopians near Ætna is certain: but those mentioned by Homer were of another country, and are represented as natives of the continent though his account is very indeterminate and obscure. There were probably people of this family in many parts of Sicily, especially about the city Camarina. They seem to have been of the Anakim race, and worshippers of the Sun. Hence they were styled Camarin,
and their chief city Camarina, which was so called from a city of the same name in [555]Chaldea, the Ur of the Scriptures. Polyphemus is mentioned as a musician and a shepherd; but of a savage and brutal disposition: which character arose from the cruel rites practised by the Cyclopians. According to
[556]Bacchylides it was said, that Galatus, Illyrius, and Celtus were the sons of Polyphemus. By this was certainly signified, that the Galatæ, Illyrii, and Celtæ, were of Cyclopian original, and of the Anakim race; all equally Amonians. Lycophron mentions the cave of this personage, by which was meant an
antient temple; and he calls it [557]μονογληνου στεγας Χαρωνος: the habitation of Charon, a personage with one eye. But here, as I have often observed, the place is mistaken for a person; the temple for the Deity. Charon was the very place; the antient temple of the Sun. It was therefore styled Char-On from the God, who was there worshipped; and after the Egyptian custom an eye was engraved
over its portal. These temples were sometimes called Charis, [558]Χαρις; which is a compound of CharIs, and signifies a prutaneion, or place sacred to Hephastus. As the rites of fire were once almost
universally practised, there were many places of this name, especially in [559]Parthia, Babylonia, and Phrygia. The Grecians rendered Char-Is by Χαρις, a term in their own language, which signified grace and elegance. And nothing witnesses their attachment to antient terms more than their continually introducing them, though they were strangers to their true meaning. The Arimaspians were Hyperborean Cyclopians; and had temples named Charis, or Charisia, in the top of which were preserved a perpetual
fire. They were of the same family as those of [560]Sicily, and had the same rites; and particularly
worshipped the Ophite Deity under the name of [561]Opis. Aristeas Proconnesius wrote their history; and among other things mentioned that they had but one eye, which was placed in their graceful forehead.
[562]Οφθαλμον δ' ἑν' ἑκαστος εχει χαριεντι μετωπῳ.
How could the front of a Cyclopian, one of the most hideous monsters that ever poetic fancy framed, be styled graceful? The whole is a mistake of terms: and what this writer had misapplied, related to Charis, a tower; and the eye was the casement in the top of the edifice, where a light, and fire were kept up. What confirmed the mistake was the representation of an eye, which, as I have mentioned, was often engraved over the entrance of these temples. The chief Deity of Egypt was frequently represented under
the symbol of an eye, [563]and a sceptre. I have observed, that Orion was supposed to have had three fathers, merely because a tower, sacred to him in Sicily, and called Tor-Pator, was altered to Τριπατωρ; which change seemed to countenance such an opinion. The Cyclopians were of the same region in that island; and their towers had undoubtedly the same name: for the Cyclopians were styled
[564]Τριτοπατερες, and were supposed to have been three in number. Some such mistake was made about the towers styled Charis: whence the Grecians formed their notion of the Graces. As Charis was a tower sacred to fire; some of the Poets have supposed a nymph of that name, who was beloved by
Vulcan. Homer speaks of her as his wife: [565]Χαρις—Καλη, ἡν ωπυιε περικλυτος Αμφιγυνεις. But Nonnus makes her his mistress; and says, that he turned her out of doors for her jealousy.
[566]Εκ δε δομων εδιωκε Χαριν ζηλημονα νυμφην.
The Graces were said to be related to the Sun who was in reality the same as Vulcan. The Sun among the people of the east was called Hares, and with a guttural, Chares: and his temple was styled TorChares. But as Tor-Pator was changed to Tripator; so Tor-Chares was rendered Trichares, which the



Greeks expressed Τριχαρις; and from thence formed a notion of three Graces. Cicero says, that they were the daughters of night, and Erebus: but Antimachus, more agreeably to this etymology,
maintained, that they were the offspring of the Sun and light; [567]Αιγλης και Ἡλιου θυγατερας. These seeming contradictions are not difficult to be reconciled.
The Amonians, wherever they settled, were celebrated for their superiority in science; and particularly for their skill in building. Of this family were Trophonius, and his brother Agamedes, who are
represented as very great in the profession. They were truly wonderful, says [568]Pausanias, for the temples, which they erected to the Gods; and for the stately edifices, which they built for men. They were the architects, who contrived the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and the treasury constructed to Urius. They were, I make no doubt, some of those, who were styled Cyclopians; as the people under this appellation were far the most eminent in this way. When the Sibyl in Virgil shews Æneas the place of torment in the shades below, and leads him through many melancholy recesses, we find that the whole was separated from the regions of bliss by a wall built by the Cyclopians. The Sibyl accordingly at their exit tells him,
[569]Cyclopum educta caminis Mœnia conspicio.
From hence we find that they were the reputed builders of the infernal mansions; which notion arose from the real buildings, which they erected. For all the ideas of the antients about the infernal regions, and the torments of hell, were taken from the temples in each country; and from the rites and inquisition practised in them. But the Cyclopians were not merely imaginary operators. They founded several cities in Greece; and constructed many temples to the Gods, which were of old in high repute. They were so much esteemed for their skill, that, as the Scholiast upon Statius observes, every thing great and noble
was looked upon as Cyclopian: [570]quicquid magnitudine suâ nobile est, Cyclopum manu dicitur fabricatum. Nor was this a fiction, as may be surmised; for they were in great measure the real architects. And if, in the room of those portentous beings the Cyclopes, Κυκλωπες, we substitute a colony of people called Cyclopians, we shall find the whole to be true, which is attributed to them; and a new field of history will be opened, that was before unknown. They were, undoubtedly, a part of the people styled Academians, who resided in Attica; where they founded the Academia, and Ceramicus, and introduced human sacrifices. Hence we are informed, that the Athenians, in the time of a plague,
sacrificed three virgin daughters of Hyacinthus at the tomb Geræstus, the [571]Cyclops. But Geræstus was not a person, but a place. Γεραιστος is a small variation for Ker-Astus; and signifies the temple of Astus the God of fire. It was certainly the antient name of the place where these sacrifices were exhibited: and the Taphos was a Cyclopian altar, upon which they were performed. The Cyclopians are said to have built the antient city Mycene, which Hercules in Seneca threatens to ruin.
——[572]quid moror? majus mihi Bellum Mycenis restat, ut Cyclopea Eversa manibus mœnia nostris concidant.
Nonnus speaks of the city in the same light:
[573]Στεμματι τειχιοεντι περιζωσθεντα Μυκηνη, Κυκλωπων κανονεσσι.
The gate of the city, and the chief tower were particularly ascribed to them: [574]Κυκλωπων δε και
ταυτα εργα ειναι λεγουσιν. These too are represented as the work of the Cyclopians. They likewise built Argos; which is mentioned by Thyestes in Seneca as a wonderful performance.
[575]Cyclopum sacras Turres, labore majus humano decus.
All these poetical histories were founded in original truths. Some of them built Hermione, one of the
most antient cities in Greece. The tradition was, that it was built by [576]Hermion the son of Europs, or Europis, a descendant of Phoroneus, and Niobe; and was inhabited by Dorians, who came from Argos: in which history is more than at first appears. The city stood near a stagnant lake, and a deep cavern;
where was supposed to be the most compendious passage to the shades below: [577]την εις ἁδου
καταβασιν συντομον. The lake was called the pool of Acherusia; near to which and the yawning
cavern the Cyclopians chose to take up their habitation. They are said to have built [578]Tiryns; the walls
of which were esteemed no less a wonder than the [579]pyramids of Egypt. They must have resided at Nauplia in Argolis; a place in situation not unlike Hermione above-mentioned. Near this city were
caverns in the earth, and subterraneous passages, consisting of [580]labyrinths cut in the rock, like the



syringes in Upper Egypt, and the maze at the lake Mæris: and these too were reputed the work of
Cyclopians. Pausanias thinks very truly, that the Nauplians were from Egypt. [581]Ησαν δε ὁι
Ναυπλιεις, εμοι δοκειν, Αιγυπτιοι τα παλαιοτερα. The Nauplians seem to me to have been a colony from Egypt in the more early times. He supposes that they were some of those emigrants, who came over with Danaüs. The nature of the works, which the Cyclopians executed, and the lake, which they named Acherusia, shew plainly the part of the world from whence they came. The next city to Nauplia was Trœzen, where Orus was said to have once reigned, from whom the country was called Oraia: but Pausanias very justly thinks, that it was an Egyptian history; and that the region was
denominated from [582]Orus of Egypt, whose worship undoubtedly had been here introduced. So that every circumstance witnesses the country, from whence the Cyclopians came. Hence when
[583]Euripides speaks of the walls of antient Mycene, as built by the Cyclopians after the Phenician rule and method: the Phenicians alluded to were the Φοινικες of Egypt, to which country they are primarily to be referred. Those who built Tiryns are represented as seven in number; and the whole is described by Strabo in the following manner. [584]Τιρυνθι ὁρμητηριῳ χρησασθαι δοκει Προιτος, και τειχισαι δια Κυκλωπων· ὁυς ἑπτα μεν ειναι, καλεισθαι δε Γαστεροχειρας, τρεφομενους εκ της τεχνης. Prœtus seems to have been the first who made use of Tiryns as an harbour; which place he walled round by the assistance of the Cyclopians. They were seven in number, styled Gastrocheirs; and lived by their labour. Hesychius in some degree reverses this strange name, and says, that they were called Εγχειρογαστερες. The Grecians continually mistook places for persons, as I have shewn. These seven Cyclopes were, I make no doubt, seven Cyclopian towers built by the people, of whom I have been treating. Some of them stood towards the harbour to afford light to ships, when they
approached in the night. They were sacred to Aster, or [585]Astarte; and styled Astro-caer, and CaerAster; out of which the Greeks formed Γαστροχειρ, and Εγχειρογαστηρ; a strange medley made up of hands, and bellies. Strabo in particular having converted these building's into so many masons, adds, [586]Γαστεροχειρας, τρεφομενους εκ της τεχνης. They were honest bellyhanded men, industrious people, who got their livelihood by their art. These towers were erected likewise for Purait, or Puratheia, where the rites of fire were performed: but Purait, or Puraitus, the Greeks changed to
Προιτος; and gave out that the towers were built for [587]Prœtus, whom they made a king of that country.
I imagine, that not only the common idea of the Cyclopians was taken from towers and edifices; but that the term Κυκλωψ, and Κυκλωπις, Cuclops, and Cuclopis, signified a building or temple; and from thence the people had their name. They were of the same family as the Cadmians, and Phœnices; and as the Hivites, or Ophites who came from Egypt, and settled near Libanus and Baal Hermon, upon the confines of Canaan. They worshipped the Sun under the symbol of a serpent: hence they were styled in different parts, where they in time settled, Europians, Oropians, Anopians, Inopians, Asopians, Elopians; all which names relate to the worship of the Pytho Ops, or Opis. What may be the precise etymology of the term Κυκλωψ, Cuclops, I cannot presume to determine. Cuclops, as a personage, was
said to have been the son of [588]Ouranus and the earth: which Ouranus among the Amonians was often styled Cœl, or Cœlus; and was worshipped under the forementioned emblem of a serpent. Hence the temple of the Deity may have been originally called Cu-Cœl-Ops, Domus Cœli Pythonis; and the priests and people Cucelopians. But whatever may have been the purport of the name, the history of these personages is sufficiently determinate.
There was a place in Thrace called [589]Cuclops, where some of the Cyclopian race had settled; for many of the Amonians came hither. Hence Thrace seems at one time to have been the seat of science: and the Athenians acknowledged, that they borrowed largely from them. The natives were very famous; particularly the Pierians for their music, the Peonians for pharmacy, and the Edonians for their rites and worship. Those, who went under the name of Cyclopes, probably introduced architecture; for which art they seem to have been every where noted. There was a fountain in these parts, of which Aristotle takes notice, as of a wonderful nature. [590]Εν δε Κυκλωψι τοις Θραξι κρηνιδιον εστιν, ὑδωρ εχων, ὁ τῃ μεν οψει καθαρον, και διαφανες, και τοις αλλοις ὁμοιον· ὁταν δε πιῃ τι ζωον εξ αυτου, παραχρημα διαφθειρεται. In the region of the Cyclopians of Thrace is a fountain, clear to the eye, and pure, and in no wise differing from common water: of which, however, if an animal drinks, it is immediately poisoned. There is another account given by Theopompus; who speaks of the people by the name of the Chropes, which is a contraction for Charopes. He says, that even going into the water was fatal. [591]Θεοπομπος ἱστορει κρηνην εν Χρωψι της Θρακης, εξ ἡς τους λουσαμενους παραχρημα μεταλλασσειν. Theopompus mentions a fountain among the Charopes of Thrace, in which, if a person attempts to bathe, he immediately loses his life. I have taken notice of this history,
because we find, that the persons who are called [592]Cuclopes by one writer, are styled Char-opes by another, and very justly: for the terms are nearly of the same purport. The Charopes were denominated from a temple, and place called Char-Ops, or Char-Opis, locus Dei Pythonis: and the Cyclopes were, as I have before supposed, denominated from Cu-Coel-Ops, or Cu-Coel-Opis, the temple of the same



Deity. They were both equally named from the Ophite God, the great object of their adoration, and from the temple where he was worshipped.
The head of Medusa in Argolis is said to have been the work of the [593]Cyclopians. This seems to have been an antient hieroglyphical representation upon the temple of Caphisus. It was usual with the Egyptians, and other Amonians, to describe, upon the Architrave of their temples, some emblem of the Deity, who there presided. This representation was often an eagle, or vulture; a wolf, or a lion; also an
heart, or an eye. The last, as I have shewn, was common to the temples of [594]Osiris, and was intended to signify the superintendency of Providence, from whom nothing was hid. Among others the serpent was esteemed a most salutary emblem: and they made use of it to signify superior skill and knowledge. A beautiful female countenance, surrounded with an assemblage of serpents, was made to denote divine wisdom, which they styled Meed, and Meet, the Μητις of the Greeks. Under this characteristic they represented an heavenly personage, and joined her with Eros, or divine love: and by these two they supposed that the present mundane system was produced. Orpheus speaks of this Deity in the masculine gender:
[595]Και Μητις, πρωτος γενετωρ, και Ερως πολυτερπης.
On this account many antient temples were ornamented with this curious hieroglyphic: and among
others the temple of Caphisus [596]in Argolis. Caphisus is a compound of Caph-Isis, which signifies Petra Isidis, and relates to the same Deity as Metis. For we must not regard sexes, nor difference of appellations, when we treat of antient Deities.
[597]Αρσην μεν και θηλυς εφυς, πολεματοκε Μητι. [598]Παντοφυης, γενετωρ παντων, πολυωνυμε Δαιμον.
I have taken notice that the Cyclopians of Thrace were styled Charopes; which name they must have received from their rites, and place of worship. Char-Opis signifies the temple of the Python, or serpent: and we find that it was situated near a poisonous pool. It was sacred to the Sun: and there were many
temples of this name in [599]Egypt, and other countries. The Sun was called Arez; and the lion, which was an emblem of the Sun, had the same denomination: and there is reason to think, that the device upon Charopian temples was sometimes a lion. Homer, undoubtedly, had seen the fierce figure of this animal upon some sacred portal in Egypt; to which he often alludes, when he speaks of a Charopian lion.
[600]Αρκτοιτ', αγροτεροι τε Συες, χαροποι τε Λεοντες.



Pl. IX. MEDUSA.
From a Gem in the Collection of His Grace the Duke of Marlborough
The devices upon temples were often esteemed as talismans, and supposed to have an hidden and salutary influence, by which the building was preserved. In the temple of Minerva, at Tegea, was some
sculpture of Medusa, which the Goddess was said to have given, [601]αναλωτον ες τον παντα
κρονον ειναι (την πολιν); to preserve the city from ever being taken in war. It was probably from
this opinion, that the [602]Athenians had the head of Medusa represented upon the walls of their acropolis: and it was the insigne of many cities, as we may find from antient coins. The notion of the Cyclopes framing the thunder and lightning for Jupiter arose chiefly from the Cyclopians engraving hieroglyphics of this sort upon the temples of the Deity. Hence they were represented as persons,
[603]Ὁι Ζηνι βροντην τ' εδοσαν, τευξαν τε κεραυνον.
The Poets considered them merely in the capacity of blacksmiths, and condemned them to the anvil. This arose from the chief Cyclopian Deity being called Acmon, and Pyracmon. He was worshipped under the former title in Phrygia; where was a city and district called Acmonia, mentioned by Alexander



[604]Polyhistor. The Amazonians paid the like reverence: and there was a sacred grove called
Acmonium upon the [605]Thermodon, which was held in great repute. He was by some looked upon as the offspring of heaven; by others worshipped as Ouranus, and Cœlus, the heaven itself; and Acmonides
was supposed to have been his [606]son, whom some of the mythologists made the ruling spirit of the earth. Hence Simmias Rhodius introduces Divine Love displaying his influence, and saying, that he produced Acmonides, that mighty monarch of the earth, and at the same time founded the sea. [607]Λευσσε με τον Γας τε βαρυστερνου Ανακτ' Ακμονιδαν, ταν ἁλα θ' ἑδρασαντα.
Acmon seems to have been worshipped of old at Tiryns, that antient city of Greece, whose towers were said to have been built by the Cyclopians. For Acmon was the Cyclopian Deity; and is represented by Callimachus as the tutelary God of the place, though the passage has been otherwise interpreted.
[608]Τοιος γαρ αει Τιρυνθιος Ακμων Ἑστηκε προ πυλεων.
The term has commonly been looked upon as an adjective; and the passage has been rendered Talis Tirynthius indefessus, which is scarce sense. Callimachus was very knowing in mythology, and is here speaking of the Cyclopian God Acmon, whom he makes the θεος προπυλαιος, or guardian Deity of the place. It was the same God, that was afterwards called Hercules, and particularly styled Tirynthius, to whom Callimachus here alludes, under a more antient name.
As the Cyclopians were great artists, they probably were famous for works in brass, and iron: and that circumstance in their history may have been founded in truth. The Idæi Dactyli were Cyclopians: and
they are said to have first forged metals, and to have reduced them to common [609]use; the knowledge
of which art they obtained from the fusion of minerals at the burning of mount [610]Ida. Whether this was an eruption of fire from the internal part of the mountain, or only a fire kindled among the forests, which crowned its summit, cannot be determined. It was an event of antient date; and admitted, as a remarkable epocha, in the most early series of chronology. From this event the Curetes, and Corybantes,
who were the same as the [611]Idæi Dactyli, are supposed to have learned the mystery of fusing and forging metals. From them it was propagated to many countries westward, particularly to the Pangæan mountains, and the region Curetis, where the Cyclopians dwelt in Thrace: also to the region Trinacia and Leontina, near Ætna, which they occupied in Sicily.
Thus have I endeavoured to shew the true history [612]and antiquity of this people: and we may learn
from their works, [613]that there was a time, when they were held in high estimation. They were denominated from their worship: and their chief Deity among other titles was styled Acmon, and Pyracmon. They seem to have been great in many sciences: but the term Acmon signifying among the Greeks an anvil, the Poets have limited them to one base department, and considered them as so many blacksmiths. And as they resided near Ætna, they have made the burning mountain their forge:
[614]Ferrum exercebant vasto Cyclopes in antro, Brontesque, Steropesque, et nudus membra Pyracmon.



Pl. X
OF
TEMPLE RITES
IN THE
FIRST AGES.
I must continually put the reader in mind how common it was among the Greeks, not only out of the titles of the Deities, but out of the names of towers, and other edifices, to form personages, and then to invent histories to support what they had done. When they had created a number of such ideal beings, they tried to find out some relation: and thence proceeded to determine the parentage, and filiation of each, just as fancy directed. Some colonies from Egypt, and Canaan, settled in Thrace; as appears from numberless memorials. The parts which they occupied were upon the Hebrus, about Edonia, Sithonia, and Mount Hæmus. They also held Pieria, and Peonia, and all the sea coast region. It was their custom, as I have before mentioned, in all their settlements to form puratheia; and to introduce the rites of fire, and worship of the Sun. Upon the coast, of which I have been speaking, a temple of this sort was founded, which is called Torone. The name is a compound of Tor-On, as I have before taken notice. The words purathus, and puratheia, were, in the language of Egypt, Pur-Ath, and Por-Ait, formed from two titles of the God of fire. Out of one of these the Grecians made a personage, which they expressed Προιτος, Prœtus, whose daughters, or rather priestesses, were the Prœtides. And as they followed the Egyptian rites, and held a Cow sacred, they were, in consequence of it, supposed to have been turned
into [615]cows; just as the priestesses of Hippa were said to have been changed into mares; the Œnotropæ and Peleiadæ into pigeons. Proteus of Egypt, whom Menelaus was supposed to have consulted about his passage homeward, was a tower of this sort with a purait. It was an edifice, where both priests and pilots resided to give information; and where a light was continually burning to direct the ships in the night. The tower of Torone likewise was a Pharos, and therefore styled by Lycophron φλεγραια Τορωνη, the flaming Torone. The country about it was, in like manner, called
[616]Φλεγρα, Phlegra, both from these flaming Towers, and from the worship there introduced. There seems to have been a fire-tower in this region named Proteus; for, according to the antient accounts, Proteus is mentioned as having resided in these parts, and is said to have been married to Torone. He is accordingly styled by the Poet,
[617]φλεγραιας ποσις Στυγνος Τορωνης, ᾡ γελως απεχθεται, Και δακρυ.
The epithet στυγνος, gloomy, and sad, implies a bad character, which arose from the cruel rites practised in these places. In all these temples they made it a rule to sacrifice strangers, whom fortune
brought in their way. Torone stood near [618]Pallene, which was styled [619]Γηγενων τροφος, the nurse of the earth-born, or giant brood. Under this character both the sons of Chus, and the Anakim of Canaan are included. Lycophron takes off from Proteus the imputation of being accessary to the vile practices, for which the place was notorious; and makes only his sons guilty of murdering strangers. He says, that their father left them out of disgust,
[620]Τεκνων αλυξας τας ξενοκτονας παλας.
In this he alludes to a custom, of which I shall take notice hereafter. According to Eustathius, the notion was, that Proteus fled by a subterraneous passage to Egypt, in company with his daughter Eidothea.
[621]Αποκατεστη εις Φαρον μετα της θυγατρος Ειδοθεας. He went, it seems, from one Pharos to another; from Pallene to the mouth of the Nile. The Pharos of Egypt was both a watch-tower, and a temple, where people went to inquire about the success of their voyage; and to obtain the assistance of pilots. Proteus was an Egyptian title of the Deity, under which he was worshipped, both in the Pharos,
and at [622]Memphis. He was the same as Osiris, and Canobus: and particularly the God of mariners,
who confined his department to the [623]sea. From hence, I think, we may unravel the mystery about the pilot of Menelaus, who is said to have been named Canobus, and to have given name to the principal
seaport in Egypt. The priests of the country laughed at the idle [624]story; and they had good reason: for the place was far prior to the people spoken of, and the name not of Grecian original. It is observable,



that Stephanus of Byzantium gives the pilot another name, calling him, instead of Canobus, Φαρος,
Pharus. His words are Φαρος ὁ Πρωρευς Μεναλαου, which are scarce sense. I make no doubt, from the history of Proteus above, but that in the original, whence Stephanus copied, or at least whence the story was first taken, the reading was Φαρος ὁ Πρωτευς Μενελαου; that is, the Proteus of Menelaus, so celebrated by Homer, who is represented, as so wise, and so experienced in navigation, whom they esteemed a great prophet, and a Deity of the sea, was nothing else but a Pharos. In other words, it was a temple of Proteus upon the Canobic branch of the Nile, to which the Poet makes Menelaus have recourse. Such was the original history: but Πρωτευς Μενελαου has been changed to πρωρευς; and the God Canobus turned into a Grecian pilot. As these were Ophite temples, a story has been added
about this person having been stung by a serpent. [625]Πρωρευς εν τῃ νησῳ δηχθεις ὑπο οφεως
εταφη. This Pilot was bitten by a serpent, and buried in the island. Conformable to my opinion is the
account given by Tzetzes, who says, that Proteus resided in the [626]Pharos: by which is signified, that he was the Deity of the place. He is represented in the Orphic poetry as the first-born of the world, the
chief God of the sea, and at the same time a mighty [627]prophet.
The history then of Menelaus in Egypt, if such a person ever existed, amounts to this. In a state of uncertainty he applied to a temple near Canobus, which was sacred to Proteus. This was one title out of many, by which the chief Deity of the country was worshipped, and was equivalent to On, Orus, Osiris, and Canobus. From this place Menelaus obtained proper advice, by which he directed his voyage.
Hence some say, that he had Φροντις, Phrontis, for his pilot. [628]Κυβερνητης αριστος Μενελαου ὁ
Φροντις, ὑιος Ονητορος. Menelaus had an excellent pilot, one Phrontis, the son of Onetor. This, I think, confirms all that I have been saying: for what is Phrontis, but advice and experience? and what is Onetor, but the Pharos, from whence it was obtained? Onetor is the same as Torone, Τορωνη, only
reversed. They were both temples of Proteus, the same as On, and Orus: both Φλεγραιαι, by which is meant temples of fire, or light-houses. Hence we may be pretty certain, that the three pilots, Canobus, Phrontis, Pharos, together with Onetor, were only poetical personages: and that the terms properly related to towers, and sanctuaries, which were of Egyptian original.
These places were courts of justice, where the priests seem to have practised a strict inquisition; and where pains and penalties were very severe. The notion of the Furies was taken from these temples: for the term Furia is from Ph'ur, ignis, and signifies a priest of fire. It was on account of the cruelties here practised, that most of the antient judges are represented as inexorable; and are therefore made judges in hell. Of what nature their department was esteemed may be learned from Virgil,
[629]Gnossius hæc Rhadamanthus habet durissima regna: Castigatque, auditque dolos, subigitque fateri, &c.
The temple at Phlegya in Bœotia was probably one of these courts; where justice was partially administered, and where great cruelties were exercised by the priests. Hence a person, named Phlegyas, is represented in the shades below, crying out in continual agony, and exhorting people to justice.
[630]—Phlegyasque miserrimus omnes Admonet, et tristi testatur voce per umbras, Discite justitiam moniti, et non temnere Divos.
Excellent counsel, but introduced rather too late. Phlegyas was in reality the Sun; so denominated by the Æthiopes, or Cuthites, and esteemed the same as Mithras of Persis. They looked up to him as their great benefactor, and lawgiver: for they held their laws as of divine original. His worship was introduced among the natives of Greece by the Cuthites, styled Ethiopians, who came from Egypt. That this was the true history of Phlegyas we may be assured from Stephanus, and Phavorinus. They mention both
Phlegyas, and Mithras, as men deified; and specify, that they were of Ethiopian original. [631]Μιθραν,
και Φλεγυαν, ανδρας Αιθιοπας το γενος. Minos indeed is spoken of, as an upright judge: and the person alluded to under that character was eminently distinguished for his piety, and justice. But his priests were esteemed far otherwise, for they were guilty of great cruelties. Hence we find, that Minos was looked upon as a judge of hell, and styled Quæsitor Minos. He was in reality a Deity, the same as Menes, and Menon of Egypt: and as Manes of Lydia, Persis, and other countries. And though his history be not consistently exhibited, yet, so much light may be gained from the Cretans, as to certify us, that there was in their island a temple called Men-Tor, the tower of Men, or Menes. The Deity, from a
particular [632]hieroglyphic, under which the natives worshipped him, was styled Minotaurus. To this temple the Athenians were obliged annually to send some of their prime youth to be sacrificed; just as
the people of Carthage used to send their children to be victims at [633]Tyre. The Athenians were obliged for some time to pay this tribute, as appears from the festival in commemoration of their deliverance. The places most infamous for these customs were those, which were situated upon the seacoast: and especially those dangerous passes, where sailors were obliged to go on shore for



assistance, to be directed in their way. Scylla upon the coast of Rhegium was one of these: and appears to have been particularly dreaded by mariners. Ulysses in Homer says, that he was afraid to mention her name to his companions, lest they should through astonishment have lost all sense of preservation.
[634]Σκυλλην δ' ουκετ' εμυθεομην απρηκτον ανιην, Μηπως μοι δεισαντες απολληξειαν ἑταιροι, Ειρεσιης, εντος δε πυκαζοιεν σφεας αυτους.
Some suppose Scylla to have been a dangerous rock; and that it was abominated on account of the frequent shipwrecks. There was a rock of that name, but attended with no such peril. We are informed
by Seneca, [635]Scyllam saxum esse, et quidem non terribile navigantibus. It was the temple, built of old
upon that [636]eminence, and the customs which prevailed within, that made it so detested. This temple was a Petra: hence Scylla is by Homer styled Σκυλλη Πετραιη; and the dogs, with which she was supposed to have been surrounded, were Cahen, or priests.
As there was a Men-tor in Crete, so there was a place of the same name, only reversed, in Sicily, called Tor-men, and Tauromenium. There is reason to think, that the same cruel practices prevailed here. It stood in the country of the Lamiæ, Lestrygons, and Cyclopes, upon the river On-Baal, which the Greeks rendered Onoballus. From hence we may conclude, that it was one of the Cyclopian buildings. Homer has presented us with something of truth, though we receive it sadly mixed with fable. We find from him, that when Ulysses entered the dangerous pass of Rhegium, he had six of his comrades seized by Scylla: and he loses the same number in the cavern of the Cyclops, which that monster devoured. Silenus, in a passage before taken notice of, is by Euripides made to say, that the most agreeable repast to the Cyclops was the flesh of strangers: nobody came within his reach, that he did not feed upon.
[637]Γλυκυτατα, φησι, τα κρεα τους ξενους φερειν· Ουδεις μολων δευρ', ὁστις ου κατεσφαγη.
From these accounts some have been led to think, that the priests in these temples really fed upon the flesh of the persons sacrificed: and that these stories at bottom allude to a shocking depravity; such, as one would hope, that human nature could not be brought to. Nothing can be more horrid, than the cruel process of the Cyclops, as it is represented by Homer. And though it be veiled under the shades of poetry, we may still learn the detestation, in which these places were held.
[638]Συν δε δυω μαρψας ὡστε σκυλακας ποτι γαιῃ Κοπτ', εκ δ' εγκεφαλος χαμαδις ῥεε, δευε δε γαιαν. Τους τε διαμελεϊστι ταμων ὡπλισσατο δορπον· Ησθιε δ' ωστε λεων ορεσιτροφος, ουδ' απελειπεν Εγκατα τε, σαρκας τε, και οστεα μυελοεντα. Ἡμεις δε κλαιοντες ανεσχεθομεν Διι χειρας, Σκετλια εργ' ὁροωντες, αμηχανιη δ' εχε θυμον.
[639]He answered with his deed: his bloody hand Snatch'd two unhappy of my martial band, And dash'd like dogs against the rocky floor: The pavement swims with brains, and mingled gore. Torn limb from limb, he spreads the horrid feast, And fierce devours it like a mountain beast. He sucks the marrow, and the blood he drains; Nor entrails, flesh, nor solid bone remains. We see the death, from which we cannot move, And humbled groan beneath the hand of Jove.
One would not be very forward to strengthen an imputation, which disgraces human nature: yet there must certainly have been something highly brutal and depraved in the character of this people, to have given rise to this description of foul and unnatural feeding. What must not be concealed, Euhemerus, an antient writer, who was a native of these parts, did aver, that this bestial practice once prevailed. Saturn's devouring his own children is supposed to allude to this custom. And we learn from this writer, as the
passage has been transmitted by [640]Ennius, that not only Saturn, but Ops, and the rest of mankind in
their days, used to feed upon human flesh.—[641]Saturnum, et Opem, cæterosque tum homines humanam carnem solitos esitare. He speaks of Saturn, and Ops, as of persons, who once lived in the world, and were thus guilty. But the priests of their temples were the people to be really accused; the Cyclopians, Lamiæ, and Lestrygons, who officiated at their altars. He speaks of the custom, as well known: and it had undoubtedly been practised in those parts, where in aftertimes hie was born. For he



was a native [642]of Zancle, and lived in the very country, of which we have been speaking, in the land of the Lestrygons, and Cyclopians. The promontory of Scylla was within his sight. He was therefore well qualified to give an account of these parts; and his evidence must necessarily have weight. Without doubt these cruel practices left lasting impressions; and the memorials were not effaced for ages.
It is said of Orpheus by Horace, Cædibus, et victu fœdo deterruit: by which one should be led to think, that the putting a stop to this unnatural gratification was owing to him. Others think, that he only discountenanced the eating of raw flesh, which before had been usual. But this could not be true of Orpheus: for it was a circumstance, which made one part of his institutes. If there were ever such a man, as Orpheus, he enjoined the very thing, which he is supposed to have prohibited. For both in the
[643]orgies of Bacchus and in the rites of Ceres, as well as of other Deities, one part of the mysteries consisted in a ceremony styled ωμοφαγια; at which time they eat the flesh quite crude with the blood.
In Crete at the [644]Dionusiaca they used to tear the flesh with their teeth from the animal, when alive.
This they did in commemoration of Dionusus. [645]Festos funeris dies statuunt, et annuum sacrum trietericâ consecratione componunt, omnia per ordinem facientes, quæ puer moriens aut fecit, aut passus est. Vivum laniant dentibus Taurum, crudeles epulas annuis commemorationibus excitantes. Apollonius
Rhodius speaking of persons like to Bacchanalians, represents them [646]Θυασιν ωμοβοροις ικελαι, as savage as the Thyades, who delighted in bloody banquets. Upon this the Scholiast observes, that the Mænadas, and Bacchæ, used to devour the raw limbs of animals, which they had cut or torn asunder.
[647]Πολλακις τῃ μανιᾳ κατασχισθεντα, και ωμοσπαρακτα, εσθιουσιν. In the island of Chios it was a religious custom to tear a man limb from limb by way of sacrifice to Dionusus. The same obtained in Tenedos. It is Porphyry, who gives the account. He was a staunch Pagan, and his evidence on that account is of consequence. He quotes for the rites of Tenedos Euelpis the Carystian. [648]Εθυοντο δε και εν Χιω τῳ Ωμαδιῳ Διονυσῳ ανθρωπον διεσπωντες· και εν Τενεδῳ, φησιν Ευελπις ὁ Καρυστιος. From all which we may learn one sad truth, that there is scarce any thing so impious and unnatural, as not at times to have prevailed.
We need not then wonder at the character given of the Lestiygones, Lamiæ, and Cyclopians, who were inhabitants of Sicily, and lived nearly in the same part of the island. They seem to have been the priests, and priestesses, of the Leontini, who resided at Pelorus, and in the Cyclopian towers: on which account
the Lamiæ are by Lucilius termed [649]Turricolæ. They are supposed to have delighted in human blood, like the Cyclopians, but with this difference, that their chief repast was the flesh of young persons and children; of which they are represented as very greedy. They were priests of Ham, called El Ham; from whence was formed ’Lamus and ’Lamia. Their chief city, the same probably, which was named Tauromenium, is mentioned by Homer, as the city of Lamus.
[650]Ἑβδοματῃ δ' ἱκομεσθα Λαμου αιπυ πτολιεθρον.
And the inhabitants are represented as of the giant race.
[651]Φοιτων δ' ιφθιμοι Λαιστρυγονες, αλλοθεν αλλος, Μυριοι, ουκ ανδρεσσιν εοικοτες, αλλα Γιγασι.
Many give an account of the Lestrygons, and Lamiæ, upon the Liris in Italy; and also upon other parts of that coast: and some of them did settle there. But they were more particularly to be found in
[652]Sicily near Leontium, as the Scholiast upon Lycophron observes. [653]Λαιστρυγονες, ὁι νυν
Λεοντινοι. The antient Lestrygons were the people, whose posterity are now called Leontini. The same
writer takes notice of their incivility to strangers: [654]Ουκ ησαν ειθισμενοι ξενους ὑποδεχεσθαι. That they were Amonians, and came originally from Babylonia, is pretty evident from the history of the Erythrean Sibyl; who was no other than a Lamian priestess. She is said to have been the daughter of Lamia, who was the daughter of Poseidon. [655]Σιβυλλαν—Λαμιας ουσαν θυγατερα του
Ποσειδωνος. Under the character of one person is to be understood a priesthood: of which community each man was called Lamus, and each priestess Lamia. By the Sibyl being the daughter of Lamia, the daughter of Poseidon, is meant, that she was of Lamian original, and ultimately descended from the great Deity of the sea. Who is alluded to under that character, will hereafter be shewn. The countries, to which the Sibyl is referred, point out her extraction: for she is said to have come from Egypt, and
Babylonia. [656]Ὁι δε αυτην Βαβυλωνιαν, ἑτεροι δε Σιβυλλαν καλουσιν Αιγυπτιαν. If the Sibyl came from Babylonia and Egypt, her supposed parent, Lamia, must have been of the same original.
The Lamiæ were not only to be found in Italy, and Sicily, but Greece, Pontus, and [657]Libya. And however widely they may have been separated, they are still represented in the same unfavourable light. Euripides says, that their very name was detestable.



[658]Τις τ' ουνομα τοδ' επονειδιστον βροτοις Ουκ οιδε Λαμιας της Λιβυστικης γενος.
Philostratus speaks of their bestial appetite, and unnatural gluttony. [659]Λαμιας σαρκων, και
μαλιστα ανθρωπειων ερᾳν. And Aristotle alludes to practices still more shocking: as if they tore open the bodies big with child, that they might get at the infant to devour it. I speak, says he, of people, who have brutal appetites. [660]Λεγω δε τας θηριωδεις, ὁιον την ανθρωπον, την λεγουσι τας κυουσας ανασχιζουσαν τα παιδια κατεσθεειν. These descriptions are perhaps carried to a great excess; yet the history was founded in truth: and shews plainly what fearful impressions were left upon the minds of men from the barbarity of the first ages.
One of the principal places in Italy, where the Lamia seated themselves, was about Formiæ; of which Horace takes notice in his Ode to Ælius Lamia.
[661]Æli, vetusto nobilis ab Lamo, &c. Authore ab illo ducis originem, Qui Formiarum mœnia dicitur Princeps, et innantem Maricæ Littoribus tenuisse Lirim.
The chief temple of the Formians was upon the sea-coast at Caiete. It is said to have had its name from a woman, who died here: and whom some make the nurse of Æneas, others of Ascanius, others still of
[662]Creusa. The truth is this: it stood near a cavern, sacred to the God Ait, called Ate, Atis, and Attis; and it was hence called Caieta, and Caiatta. Strabo says, that it was denominated from a cave, though he
did not know the precise [663]etymology. There were also in the rock some wonderful subterranes,
which branched out into various apartments. Here the antient Lamii, the priests of Ham, [664]resided:
whence Silius Italicus, when he speaks of the place, styles it [665]Regnata Lamo Caieta. They undoubtedly sacrificed children here; and probably the same custom was common among the Lamii, as prevailed among the Lacedæmonians, who used to whip their children round the altar of Diana Orthia. Thus much we are assured by Fulgentius, and others, that the usual term among the antient Latines for
the whipping of children was Caiatio. [666]Apud Antiquos Caiatio dicebatur puerilis cædes.
The coast of Campania seems to have been equally infamous: and as much dreaded by mariners, as that of Rhegium, and Sicily. Here the Sirens inhabited, who are represented, as the bane of all, who navigated those seas. They like the Lamii were Cuthite, and Canaanitish priests, who had founded temples in these parts; and particularly near three small islands, to which they gave name. These temples were rendered more than ordinary famous on account of the women, who officiated. They were much addicted to the cruel rites, of which I have been speaking; so that the shores, upon which they resided, are described, as covered with the bones of men, destroyed by their artifice.
[667]Jamque adeo scopulos Sirenum advecta subibat, Difficiles quondam, multorumque ossibus albos.
They used hymns in their temples, accompanied with the music of their country: which must have been very enchanting, as we may judge from the traditions handed down of its efficacy. I have mentioned, that the songs of the Canaanites and Cretans were particularly plaintive, and pleasing:
[668]They sang in sweet but melancholy strains; Such as were warbled by the Delian God, When in the groves of Ida he bewail'd The lovely lost Atymnius.
But nothing can shew more fully the power of antient harmony than the character given of the Sirens. Their cruelty the antients held in detestation; yet always speak feelingly of their music. They represent their songs as so fatally winning, that nobody could withstand their sweetness. All were soothed with it; though their life was the purchase of the gratification. The Scholiast upon Lycophron makes them the
children of the muse [669]Terpsichore. Nicander supposes their mother to have been Melpomene: others make her Calliope. The whole of this is merely an allegory; and means only that they were the daughters
of harmony. Their efficacy is mentioned by [670]Apollonius Rhodius: and by the Author of the Orphic
[671]Argonautica: but the account given by Homer is by far the most affecting.
[672]Σειρηνας μεν πρωτον αφιξεαι, ἁι ῥα τε παντας Ανθρωπους θελγουσιν, ὁτις σφεας εισαφικανει. Ὁστις αϊδρειῃ πελασει, και φθογγον ακουσει



Σειρηνων, τῳ δ' ουτι γυνη, και νηπια τεκνα Οικαδε νοστησαντι παρισταται, ουδε γανυνται· Αλλα τε Σειρηνες λιγυρῃ θελγουσιν αοιδῃ, Ἡμενοι εν λειμωνι· πολυς τ' αμφ' οστεοφιν θις Ανδρων πυθομενων, περι δε ῥινοι φθινυθουσιν.
They are the words of Circe to Ulysses, giving him an account of the dangers which he was to encounter.
[673]Next where the Sirens dwell, you plough the seas. Their song is death, and makes destruction please. Unblest the man, whom music makes to stray Near the curst coast, and listen to their lay. No more that wretch shall view the joys of life, His blooming offspring, or his pleasing wife.
In verdant meads they sport, and wide around Lie human bones, that whiten all the ground: The ground polluted floats with human gore, And human carnage taints the dreadful shore. Fly, fly the dangerous coast.
The story at bottom relates to the people above-mentioned; who with their music used to entice strangers into the purlieus of their temples, and then put them to death. Nor was it music only, with which persons were seduced to follow them. The female part of their choirs were maintained for a twofold purpose, both on account of their voices and their beauty. They were accordingly very liberal of their favours, and by these means enticed seafaring persons, who paid dearly for their entertainment. Scylla was a personage of this sort: and among the fragments of Callimachus we have a short, but a most perfect, description of her character.
[674]Σκυλλα, γυνη κατακασα, και ου ψυθος ουνομ' εχουσα.
Κατακασα is by some interpreted malefica: upon which the learned Hemsterhusius remarks very justly
—κατακασα cur Latine vertatur malefica non video. Si Grammaticis obtemperes, meretricem
interpretabere: erat enim revera Νησιωτις καλη ἑταιρα, ut Heraclitus περι απις: c. 2. Scylla then, under which character we are here to understand the chief priestess of the place, was no other than a handsome island strumpet. Her name it seems betokened as much, and she did not belie it: ου ψυθος
ουνομ' εχουσα. We may from these data decipher the history of Scylla, as given by Tzetzes. Ην δε
πρωτον Σκυλλα γυνη ευπρεπης· Ποσειδωνι δε συνουσα απεθηριωθη. Scylla was originally a handsome wench: but being too free with seafaring people she made herself a beast. She was, like the
Sibyl of Campania, said by Stesichorus to have been the daughter of [675]Lamia. Hence we may learn, that all, who resided in the places, which I have been describing, were of the same religion, and of the same family; being the descendants of Ham, and chiefly by the collateral branches of Chus, and Canaan.
The like rites prevailed in Cyprus, which had in great measure been peopled by persons of these
[676]families. One of their principal cities was Curium, which was denominated from [677]Curos, the Sun, the Deity, to whom it was sacred. In the perilous voyages of the antients nothing was more common than for strangers, whether shipwrecked, or otherwise distressed, to fly to the altar of the chief Deity, Θεου φιλιου, και ξενιου, the God of charity and hospitality, for his protection. This was fatal to those who were driven upon the western coast of Cyprus. The natives of Curium made it a rule to destroy all such, under an appearance of a religious rite. Whoever laid their hands upon the altar of
Apollo, were cast down the precipice, upon which it stood. [678]Ευθυς εστιν ακρα, αφ' ἡς ῥιπτουσι
τους ἁψαμενους του βωμου του Απολλωνος. Strabo speaks of the practice, as if it subsisted in his
time. A like custom prevailed at the Tauric Chersonesus, as we are informed by Herodotus. [679]Θυουσι μεν τῃ Παρθενῳ τους τε ναυηγους, και τους αν λαβωσι Ἑλληνων επαναχθεντας, τροπῳ τοιῳδε. Καταρξαμενοι ῥοπαλῳ παιουσι την κεφαλην. Ὁι μεν δη λεγουσι, ὡς το σωμα απο του κρημνου διωθεουσι κατω· επι γαρ κρημνου ἱδρυται το Ἱρον. κτλ. The people of this place worship the virgin Goddess Artemis: at whose shrine they sacrifice all persons, who have the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast: and all the Grecians, that they can lay hold of, when they are at any time thither driven. All these they without any ceremony brain with a club. Though others say, that they shove them off headlong from a high precipice: for their temple is founded upon a cliff.
The den of Cacus was properly Ca-Chus, the cavern or temple of Chus, out of which the poets, and later historians have formed a strange personage, whom they represent as a shepherd, and the son of Vulcan.



Many antient Divinities, whose rites and history had any relation to Ur in Chaldea, are said to have been the children of Vulcan; and oftentimes to have been born in fire. There certainly stood a temple of old upon the Aventine mountain in Latium, which was the terror of the neighbourhood. The cruelties of the priests, and their continual depredations, may be inferred from the history of Cacus. Virgil makes Evander describe the place to Æneas; though it is supposed in his time to have been in ruins.
[680]Jam primum saxis suspensam hanc aspice rupem, Disjectæ procul ut moles, desertaque montis Stat domus, et scopuli ingentem traxere ruinam. Hic spelunca fuit, vasto submota recessu, Semihominis Caci, facies quam dira tegebat, Solis inaccessum radiis: semperque recenti Cæde tepebat humus; foribusque affixa superbis Ora virûm tristi pendebant pallida tabo. Huic monstro Vulcanus erat pater.
Livy mentions Cacus as a shepherd, and a person of great strength, and violence. [681]Pastor, accola ejus
loci, Cacus, ferox viribus. He is mentioned also by Plutarch, who styles him Caccus, Κακκος. [682]Τον μεν γαρ Ἡφαιστου παιδα Ρωμαιοι Κακκον ἱστορουσι πυρ και φλογας αφιεναι δια του στοματος εξω ῥεουσας. As there were both priests, and priestesses, in temples of this sort, persons styled both Lami, and Lamiæ; so we read both of a Cacus, and a Caca. The latter was supposed to have
been a Goddess, who was made a Deity for having betrayed her brother to Hercules. [683]Colitur et Caca, quæ Herculi fecit indicium boum; divinitatem consecuta, quia perdidit fratrem. In short, under the characters of Caca, and Cacus, we have a history of Cacusian priests, who seem to have been a set of people devoted to rapine and murder.
What we express Cocytus, and suppose to have been merely a river, was originally a temple in Egypt called Co-Cutus: for rivers were generally denominated from some town, or temple, near which they ran. Co-Cutus means the Cuthite temple, the house of Cuth. It was certainly a place of inquisition, where great cruelties were exercised. Hence the river, which was denominated from it, was esteemed a river of hell; and was supposed to have continual cries, and lamentations resounding upon its waters.
[684]Cocytus, named of lamentation loud Heard on its banks.
Milton supposes the river to have been named from the Greek word κωκυτος: but the reverse is the
truth. From the baleful river and temple Co-cutus came the Greek terms κωκυτος, and κωκυω.
Acheron, another infernal river, was properly a temple of Achor, the θεος απομυιος of Egypt, Palestine, and Cyrene. It was a temple of the Sun, called Achor-On: and it gave name to the river, on whose banks it stood. Hence like Cocutus it was looked upon as a melancholy stream, and by the Poet
Theocritus styled [685]Αχεροντα πολυστονον, the river of lamentations. Aristophanes speaks of an
eminence of this name, and calls it [686]Αχεροντιος σκοπελος ἁιματοσταγης, the rock of Acheron, dropping blood.
OF
MEED ΜΗΤΙΣ,
AND THE
G HIPPA.
One of the most antient Deities of the Amonians was named Meed, or Meet; by which was signified divine wisdom. It was rendered by the Grecians Μητις in the masculine: but seems to have been a feminine Deity; and represented under the symbol of a beautiful female countenance surrounded with
serpents. The author of the Orphic Poetry makes Metis the origin of all [687]things: which Proclus
expresses [688]την δημιουργικην αιτιαν: and supposes this personage to be the same as Phanes, and Dionusus, from whom all things proceeded. By Timotheus Chronographus, in his account of the creation, this divinity was described as that vivifying light, which first broke forth upon the infant world, and produced life and motion. His notion is said to have been borrowed from Orpheus: Εφρασε



δε (ὁ [689] Ορφευς) ὁτι το φως ῥηξαν τον αιθερα εφωτισε πασαν την κτισιν· ειπων, εκεινο ειναι το φως το ῥηξαν τον αιθερα το προειρημενον, το ὑπερτατον παντων, ὁυ ονομα ὁ αυτος Ορφευς ακουσας εκ Μαντειας εξειπε ΜΗΤΙΣ, ὁπερ ἑρμηνευεται ΒΟΥΛΗ, ΦΩΣ, ΖΩΟΔΟΤΗΡ. Ειπεν εν τῃ αυτου εκθεσει ταυτας τας τρεις θειας των ονοματων δυναμεις μιαν ειναι δυναμιν, και ἑν κρατος τουτων Θεον, ὁν ουδεις ὁρᾳ. The account is remarkable. Hippa was another Goddess, of the like antiquity, and equally obsolete. Some traces however are to be still found in the Orphic verses above-mentioned, by which we may discover her original character and
department. She is there represented as the nurse of [690]Dionusus, and seems to have been the same as
Cybele, who was worshipped in the mountains of [691]Phrygia, and by the Lydians upon Tmolus. She is
said to have been the soul of the [692]world: and the person who received and fostered Dionusus, when he came from the thigh of his father. This history relates to his second birth, when he returned to a second state of childhood. Dionusus was the chief God of the Gentile world, and worshipped under various titles; which at length came to be looked upon as different Deities. Most of these secondary Divinities had the title of Hippius, and Hippia: and as they had female attendants in their temples, these too had the name of Hippai. What may have been the original of the term Hippa, and Hippus, will be matter of future disquisition. Thus much is certain, that the Greeks, who were but little acquainted with
the purport of their antient theology, uniformly referred it to [693]horses. Hence it was often prefixed to the names of Gods, and of Goddesses, when it had no relation to their department; and seemed inconsistent with their character. We have not only an account of Αρης Ἱππιος, Mars the horseman; but of Poseidon Hippius, though a God of the sea. He is accordingly complimented upon this title by the Poet Aristophanes.
[694]Ἱππι' Αναξ Ποσειδον, ᾡ Χαλκοκροτων ἱππων κτυπος Και χρεμετισμος ἁνδανει.
Ceres had the title of Hippia: and the Goddess of wisdom, Minerva, had the same. We read also of Juno Hippia, who at Olympia partook of joint rites and worship, with those equestrian Deities Neptune, and Mars. Pausanias mentions [695]Ποσειδωνος Ἱππιου, μαι Ἡρας Ἱππιου βωμοι: and hard-by τῃ μεν Αρεως Ἱππιου, τῃ δε Αθηνας Ἱππιου βωμος. In Arcadia, and Elis, the most antient rites were preserved: and the Grecians might have known, that the terms Hippa and Hippia were of foreign purport
from the other titles given to Juno at Olympia. For they sacrificed here to [696]Amonian Juno, and to Juno Paramonian; which were also titles of Hermes. Hippa was a sacred Egyptian term, and as such was conferred upon Arsinoë, the wife of Ptolemy Philadelphus: for the princes of Egypt always assumed to
themselves sacred appellations. [697]Ἱππια Αρσινοη, ἡ του Φιλαδελφου γυνη. As the Grecians did not inquire into the hidden purport of antient names, they have continually misrepresented the histories of which they treated. As Ceres was styled Hippa, they have imagined her to have been turned into a
[698]mare: and Hippius Poseidon was in like manner changed to a horse, and supposed in that shape to have had an intimate acquaintance with the Goddess. Of this Ovid takes notice.
[699]Et te, flava comas, frugum mitissima mater Sensit equum: te sensit avem crinita colubris Mater equi volucris.
The like is mentioned of the nymph [700]Ocuroë: also of Philyra, who was so changed by Saturn. He is said to have taken upon himself the same shape, and to have followed her neighing over the mountains of Thessaly.
[701]Talis et ipse jubam cervice effudit equinâ Conjugis adventu pernix Saturnus, et altum Pelion hinnitu fugiens implevit acuto.
All these legendary stories arose from this antient term being obsolete, and misapplied. Homer makes mention of the mares of Apollo, which the God was supposed to have bred in Pieria:
[702]Τας εν Πιεριῃ θρεψ' αργυροτοξος Απολλων.
And he has accordingly put them in harness, and given them to the hero Eumelus. Callimachus takes notice of the same mares in his hymn to the Shepherd God Apollo.
[703]Φοιβον και Νομιον κικλησκομεν, εξετ' εκεινου, Εξετ' επ' Αμφρυσῳ ζευγητιδας ετρεφεν ἱππας,



Ηιθεου ὑπ' ερωτι κεκαυμενος Αδμητοιο.
These Hippai, misconstrued mares, were priestesses of the Goddess Hippa, who was of old worshipped in Thessaly, and Thrace, and in many different regions. They chanted hymns in her temples, and performed the rites of fire: but the worship growing obsolete, the very terms were at last mistaken. How far this worship once prevailed may be known from the many places denominated from Hippa. It was a title of Apollo, or the Sun, and often compounded Hippa On, and contracted Hippon: of which name places occur in Africa near Carthage[704]. Ἡτε δη Κιρτα πολις ενταυθα και ὁι δυο Ἱππωνες.
Argos was of old called Hippeion; not from the animal Ἱππος, but [705]απο Ἱππης του Δαναου, from Hippa the daughter of Danaus. That is from a priestess, who founded there a temple, and introduced the rites of the Goddess whom she served. As it was a title of the Sun, it was sometimes expressed in the masculine gender Hippos: and Pausanias takes notice of a most curious, and remarkable piece of antiquity, though he almost ruins the purport of it by referring it to an horse. It stood
near mount Taygetus in Laconia, and was called the monument of Hippos. The author tells us, [706]that at particular intervals from this monument stood seven pillars, κατα τροπον οιμαι αρχαιον, placed, says he, as I imagine, according to some antient rule and method; which pillars were supposed to
represent the seven planets. If then these exterior stones related to the [707]seven erratic bodies in our sphere, the central monument of Hippos must necessarily have been designed for the Sun. And however rude the whole may possibly have appeared, it is the most antient representation upon record, and consequently the most curious, of the planetary system.
It is from hence, I think, manifest, that the titles Hippa, and Hippos, related to the luminary Osiris; and betokened some particular department of that Deity, who was the same as Dionusus. He was undoubtedly worshipped under this appellation in various regions: hence we read of Hippici Montes in Colchis: Ἱππου κωμη in Lycia: Ἱππου ακρα in Libya: Ἱππου ορος in Egypt: and a town Hippos in
Arabia Felix. There occur also in composition[708], Hippon, Hipporum, Hippouris, Hippana, Hipponesus, Hippocrene. This last was a sacred fountain, denominated from the God of light, who was the patron of verse, and science: but by the Greeks it was referred to an animal, and supposed to have been produced by the hoof of an horse. The rites of Dionusus Hippius were carried into Thrace, where the horses of Diomedes were said to have been fed with human flesh. Deianira is introduced by Ovid, as asking Hercules, if he did not well remember this practice.
[709]Non tibi succurrit crudi Diomedis imago, Efferus humanâ qui dape pavit equos?
Abderus, the founder of Abdera, is supposed to have been a victim to these animals: of which Scymnus Chius gives the following account.
[710]Των δ' επι θαλαττῃ κειμενων εστιν πολις Αβδηρ', απ' Αβδηρου μεν ωνομασμενη, Του και κτισαντος προτερον αυτην· ὁς δοκει Ὑπο των Διομηδους ὑστερον ξενοκτονων Ἱππων φθαρηναι.
These horses, ξενοκτονοι, which fed upon the flesh of strangers, were the priests of Hippa, and of Dionusus, styled Hippus, or more properly Hippius. They seem to have resided in an island, and
probably in the Thracian Chersonese: which they denominated [711]Diu-Medes, or the island of the Egyptian Deity Medes. From hence the Grecian Poets have formed a personage Diomedes, whom they have made king of the country. There were opposite to Apulia islands of the same name, where similar rites prevailed. The priests were here Cycneans, and described as a species of swans, who were kind to
people of their own race, but cruel to [712]strangers. A Diomedes is supposed to have been a king in these parts, and to have given name to these islands. It is said by Scymnus Chios above, that Abderus, who was devoured by the horses of Diomedes in Thrace, built the city, which bore his name. The Grecians continually supposed the personage, in whose honour a city was built, to have been the founder. I have mentioned, that Abderus signifies the place of Abdir, which is a contraction of Abadir, the serpent Deity Ad-Ur, or Adorus. And it is plain from many passages in antient writers, that human sacrifices were common at his shrine; and particularly those of infants. By Abdera being a victim to the horses of Diomedes is meant that the natives of that place, which stood in the vicinity of the
Chersonesus, were obliged to submit to the cruel rites of the Diomedean [713]priests. The very name must have come from them; for they worshipped the Deity under the titles of Meed, Hippa, and Abadir; and various other appellations.
There is an account given by [714]Palæphatus of one Metra, who in the more authentic manuscripts is called Μηστρα, Meestra. It is said of her, that she could change herself into various forms, particularly



εκ κορης γενεσθαι βουν, και αυθις κυνα, και ορνεον, that she would instead of a young woman appear an ox, or a cow; or else be in the shape of a dog, or of a bird. She is represented as the daughter
of Eresicthon: and these uncommon properties are mentioned by Ovid[715], who sets them off with much embellishment. The story at bottom is very plain. Egypt, the land of the Mizraim, was by the
Greeks often styled [716]Mestra and [717]Mestraia: and by the person here called Mestra we are certainly to understand a woman of that country. She was sometimes mentioned simply as a Cahen, or priestess, which the Grecians have rendered κυνα, a dog. Women in this sacred capacity attended at the shrine of Apis, and Mneuis; and of the sacred heifer at Onuphis. Some of them in different countries were styled
Cygneans, and also Peleiadæ, of whom the principal were the women at [718]Dodona. Many of them were priestesses of Hippa, and upon that account styled Hippai, as I have shewn. Hence the mythologists under the character of Meestra have represented an Egyptian priestess, who could assume many departments, which were misconstrued different shapes. She could become, if we may credit Ovid,
Nunc equa, nunc ales, modo bos.
or according to Palæphatus, βουν, κυνα, και ορνεον: a cow, a dog, and a bird. The whole of this related to the particular service of the priestess; and to the emblem under which the Deity was worshipped.
RITES
OF
DAMATER, CERES.
I shall now proceed to the rites of Ceres: and the general character of this Goddess is so innocent, and rural, that one would imagine nothing cruel could proceed from her shrine. But there was a time, when some of her temples were as much dreaded, as those of Scylla, and the Cyclops. They were courts of justice; whence she is often spoken of as a lawgiver.
[719]Prima Ceres unco terram dimovit aratro, Prima dedit leges.
She is joined by Cicero with Libera, and they are styled the Deities, [720]a quibus initia vitæ, atque victus, legum, morum, mansuetudinis, humanitatis, exempla hominibus, et civitatibus data, ac dispertita esse dicantur. The Deity, to whom she was a substitute, was El, the Sun. He was primarily worshipped in these temples: and I have shewn, that they were from Achor denominated Acherontian; also temples of Ops, and Oupis, the great serpent God. Hence it is said by Hesychius, that Acheron, and Ops, and
Helle, and [721]Gerys, and Terra, and Demeter, were the same. Ἡ [722]Αχερω, και Ωπις, και Ἑλλη,
και Γηρυς, και Γη, και Δημητηρ, [723]το αυτο. Ceres was the Deity of fire: hence at Cnidus she was
called Κυρα, [724]Cura, a title of the Sun. Her Roman name Ceres, expressed by Hesychius Gerys, was
by the Dorians more properly rendered [725]Garys. It was originally a name of a city, called Χαρις: for many of the Deities were erroneously called by the names of the places where they were worshipped.
Charis is Char-Is, the [726]city of fire; the place where Orus and Hephastus were worshipped. Hence as a
personage she is made the wife of [727]Vulcan, on account of her relation to fire. Her title of Damater was equally foreign to Greece; and came from Babylonia, and the east. It may after this seem extraordinary, that she should ever be esteemed the Goddess of corn. This notion arose in part from the Grecians not understanding their own theology: which bad originally, became continually more depraved, through their ignorance. The towers of Ceres were P'urtain, or Πρυτανεια; so called from
the fires, which were perpetually there preserved. The Grecians interpreted this πυρου ταμειον; and rendered, what was a temple of Orus, a granary of corn. In consequence of this, though they did not abolish the antient usage of the place, they made it a repository of grain, from whence they gave largesses to the people upon any act of merit. [728]Τοπος ην παρ' Αθηναιοις, εν ᾡ κοιναι σιτησεις τοις δημοσιοις ευεργεταις εδιδοντο· ὁθεν και Πρυτανειον εκαλειτο, ὁιονει πυροταμειον· πυρος γαρ ὁ σιτος· In early times the corn there deposited seems to have been for the priests and
[729]diviners. But this was only a secondary use, to which these places were adapted. They were properly sacred towers, where a perpetual fire was preserved. Pausanias takes notice of such a one in Arcadia. [730]Δημητρος, και Κορης ἱερον, πυρ δε ενταυθα καιουσι, ποιουμενοι φροντιδα, μη



λαθῃ σφισιν αποσβεσθεν. He mentions a like circumstance at the Prutaneion in Elis[731]: Εστι δε ᾑ Ἑστια τεφρας και αυτη πεποιημενη, και επ' αυτης πυρ ανα πασαν τε ἡμεραν, και εν πασῃ νυκτι ὡσαυτως καιεται. Attica at first was divided into separate and independent hamlets: each of
which had its own Prutaneion, and Archon. These Archons were priests of the [732]Prutaneia; and were denominated from their office. Archon is the same as Orchon, and like Chon-Or signifies the God of light, and fire; from which title the priests had their name. In Babylonia, and Chaldea, they were called Urchani.
As in these temples there was always a [733]light, and a fire burning on the hearth, some of the Grecians have varied in their etymology, and have derived the name from πυρ, Pur. Suidas supposes it to have
been originally called Πυρος ταμειον. [734]Πρυτανειον, πυρος ταμειον, ενθα ην ασβεστον
πυρ. The Scholiast upon Thucydides speaks to the same purpose. [735]Αλλοι δε φασιν, ὁτι το Πρυτανειον πυρος ην ταμειον, ενθα ην ασβεστον πυρ. Others tell us, that the Prutaneion was of old called Puros Tameion, from πυρ, pur: because it was the repository of a perpetual fire. It was sacred to Hestia, the Vesta of the Romans; which was only another title for Damater: and the sacred hearth had the same name. [736]Ἑστιαν δ' αν κυριωτατα καλοιης την εν Πρυτανειῳ, εφ' ἡς το πυρ το ασβεστον αναπτεται. I have mentioned, that these places were temples, and at the same time
courts of justice: hence we find, that in the Prutaneion at Athens, the laws of Solon were [737]engraved. These laws were described upon wooden cylinders: some of which remained to the time of
[738]Plutarch.
Many of these temples were dedicated to the Deity under the name of Persephone, or Proserpine, the supposed daughter of Ceres. They were in reality the same personage. Persephone was styled Κορα,
Cora; which the Greeks misinterpreted Παρθενος, the virgin, or damsel. How could a person, who according to the received accounts had been ravished by Pluto, and been his consort for ages; who was the reputed queen of hell, be styled by way of eminence Παρθενος? Κορα, Cora, which they understood was the same as Cura, a feminine title of the sun: by which Ceres also was called at Cnidos. However mild and gentle Proserpine may have been represented in her virgin state by the Poets; yet her tribunal seems in many places to have been very formidable. In consequence of this we find her with Minos, and Rhadamanthus, condemned to the shades below, as an infernal inquisitor. Nonnus says,
[739]Περσεφονη θωρηξεν Εριννυας.
Proserpine armed the furies. The notion of which Furies arose from the cruelties practised in these Prutaneia. They were called by the Latines, Furiæ; and were originally only priests of fire: but were at last ranked among the hellish tormentors. Ceres the benefactress, and lawgiver, was sometimes enrolled in the list of these dæmons. This is manifest from a passage in Antimachus, quoted by Pausanias, where her temple is spoken of as the shrine of a Fury.
[740]Δημητρος, τοθι φασιν Εριννυος ειναι εδεθλον.
The like is mentioned by the Scholiast upon Lycophron, [741]Εριννυς ἡ Δημητηρ εν Ογκαις πολει
της Αρκαδιας τιμᾳται. Her temple stood upon the river Ladon, and she had this name given to her by
the people of the place. Καλουσι δε Εριννυν ὁι Θελπουσιοι την Θεον. The Thelpusians call the Goddess Demeter a Fury. Herodotus speaks of a Prutaneion in Achaia Pthiotic, called Leïtus; of which he gives a fearful account. No person, he says, ever entered the precincts, who returned. Whatever person ever strayed that way, was immediately seized upon by the priests, and sacrificed. The custom so far prevailed, that many, who thought they were liable to suffer, fled away to foreign parts. And he adds, that after a long time, when any of them ventured to return, if they were caught, they were immediately led to the Prutaneion. Here they were crowned with garlands. and in great parade conducted to the altar. I shall quote the author's words. [742]Ληιτον δε καλεουσι το Πρυτανηιον ὁι Αχαιοι· ην δε εσελθῃ, ουκ εστι, ὁκως εξεισι, πριν η θυσεσθαι μελλῃ· ὡστε τι προς τουτοισι πολλοι ηδε των μελλοντων τουτεων θυσεσθαι, δεισαντες οιχοντο αποδραντες ες αλλην χωρην. Χρονου δε προϊοντος, οπισω κατελθοντες, ην αλισκωνται, εστελλοντο ες το Πρυτανηιον, ὡς θυεται τε εξηγεοντο, στεμμασι πας πυκασθεις, και ὡς συν πομπῃ εξαχθεις. The people of Leïtus are said to have been the sons of Cutissorus. Herodotus speaks of the temple, as remaining in his time: and of the custom still subsisting. He farther mentions, that when Xerxes was informed of the history of this place, as he passed through Thessaly, he withheld himself from being guilty of any violation. And he moreover ordered his army to pay due regard to its sanctity; so very awful, it seems, was mysterious cruelty.



I imagine, that the story of the Harpies relates to priests of the Sun. They were denominated from their seat of residence, which was an oracular temple called Harpi, and Hirpi, analogous to Orphi, and Urphi in other places. I have shewn, that the antient name of a priest was Cahen, rendered mistakenly κυν, and canis. Hence the Harpies, who were priests of Ur, are styled by Apollonius, the Dogs of Jove. His accosting Calais, and Zethus, tells them, that it would be a profanation to offer any injury to those personages.
[743]Ου θεμις, ω ὑιεις Βορεου ξιφεεσιν ελασσαν Ἁρπυιας, μεγαλοιο Διος ΚYΝΑΣ.
This term in the common acceptation is not applicable to the Harpies, either as birds, for so they are represented; or as winged animals. But this representation was only the insigne of the people, as the vulture, and eagle were of the Egyptians: a lion of the Persians. The Harpies were certainly a
[744]college of priests in Bithynia; and on that account called Cahen. They seem to have been a set of rapacious persons, who, for their repeated acts of violence, and cruelty, were driven out of the country.
Their temple was styled Arpi; and the environs Arpi-ai: hence the Grecians formed [745]Ἁρπυιαι. There was a region in Apulia named Arpi; and in its neighbourhood were the islands of Diomedes, and the birds, which were fabled to have been like swans. I have before shewn, that they were Amonian priests: so likewise were the Hirpi near Soracte in Latium. They were priests of fire: of whose customs I have taken notice.
The persons who resided in these temples are represented as persons of great strength and stature: for many of them were of the race of Anac. There is reason to think, that a custom prevailed in these places of making strangers engage in fight with some of the priests trained up for that purpose. The manner of contention was either with the cæstus, or by wrestling. And as the priest appointed for the trial was pretty sure of coming off the conqueror, the whole was looked upon as a more specious kind of
sacrifice. Amycus, who was king of Bithynia, is represented as of a [746]gigantic size, and a great proficient with the cæstus. He was in consequence of it the terror of all strangers who came upon the
coast. Cercyon of [747]Megara was equally famed for wrestling; by which art he slew many, whom he
forced to the unequal contention. But Cercyon was the name of the [748]place; and they were the Cercyonians, the priests of the temple, who were noted for these achievements. Pausanias gives an
account of them under the character of one person. [749]Ειναι δε ὁ Κερκυων λεγεται και τα αλλα
αδικος εις τους ξενους, και παλαιειν ου βουλομενοις. Cercyon was in other respects lawless in his behaviour towards strangers; but especially towards those who would not contend with him in wrestling. These Cercyonians were undoubtedly priests of Ceres, or Damater: who seems to have been tired of their service, and glad to get rid of them, as we are informed by the poet.
[750]Quæque Ceres læto vidit pereuntia vultu Corpora Theseâ Cercyonea manu.
Before most temples of old were areas, which were designed for Gumnasia, where these feats of
exercise were performed. Lucian speaks of one before the temple of [751]Apollo Lucius. And Pausanias
mentions that particular [752]parade, where Cercyon was supposed to have exhibited his art. It stood before the tomb of Alope, and was called the Palæstra of Cercyon even in the time of this writer, who takes notice of many others. He styles it ταφος Αλοπης, as if it were a tomb. But it was a Taph, or high altar, sacred to Al-Ope, Sol Pytho, who was the Deity of the place called Cer-Cuon. Before this altar was the palæstra; where the Cercyonian priests obliged people to contend with them. I have taken
notice of a Pharos at [753]Torone, which Proteus is said to have quitted, that he might not be witness to the cruelties of his sons. He fled, it seems, to Egypt, Τεκνων αλυξας τας ξενοκτονας παλας, to shun their wicked practices: for they were so skilled in the Palæstric art, that they slew all strangers whom they forced to engage with them. Taurus, called Minotaurus, was a temple in Crete: but by the
Grecians is spoken of as a person. Under this character Taurus is represented as a [754]renowned wrestler, and many persons are said to have been sent from Athens to be victims to his prowess.
Eusebius styles him, [755]ωμος και ανημερος, a man of a cruel and sour disposition. After he had
done much mischief, Theseus at length Ταυρον κατεπαλαισε, foiled him in his own art, and slew
him. He is supposed to have done the like by Cercyon. [756]Λεγεται δε ὁ Κερκυων τους
διασταντας παντας ες παλην [757]διαφθειραι πλην Θησεως. For it is said of Cercyon, that he slew every person who ventured to cope with him in wrestling, except Theseus. In all these instances the place is put for the persons who resided in it: of which mistake I have been obliged often to take notice.
Antient history affords numberless instances of this ungenerous and cruel practice. The stranger, who stood most in need of courtesy, was treated as a profest enemy: and the rites of hospitality were evaded under the undue sanction of a sacrifice to the Gods. In the history of Busiris we have an account of this



custom prevailing in Egypt. [758]Βουσιριν δε κατα την Αιγυπτον τῳ Διι καλλιερειν σφαγιαζοντα τους παρεπιδημουντας ΞΕΝΟΥΣ. It is said of Busiris, that he used to offer to Jupiter, as the most acceptable sacrifice, all the strangers, whom chance brought into his country. There was a tradition concerning Antæus, that he covered the roof of a temple, sacred to Poseidon, with the sculls of foreigners, whom he forced to engage with him. The manner of the engagement was by
[759]wrestling. Eryx in Sicily was a proficient in this art, and did much mischief to strangers: till he was in his turn slain. The Deity was the same in these parts, as was alluded to under the name of Taurus, and Minotaurus, in Crete; and the rites were the same. Hence Lycophron speaks of Eryx by the name of Taurus; and calls the place of exercise before the temple,
[760]Ταυρου γυμναδας κακοξενου Παλης κονιστρας.
This the Scholiast interprets παλαιστραν του Ερυκος του ξενοκτονου, The Gymnasium of Eryx,
who used to murder strangers. Androgeos the son of Minos came to the [761]like end, who had been
superior to every body in this art. Euripides styles the hero Cycnus [762]ξενοδαικταν, on account of his cruelty to strangers. He resided it seems near the sea-coast; used to oblige every person, who travelled that way, or whom ill fortune brought on shore to contend with him. And his ambition was to
be able with the skulls of the victims, which he slew, to build a temple to Apollo. [763]Κακοξενος ὁ Κυκνος, και εν παροδῳ της θαλασσης οικων, επεκερτομει τους παριοντας, ναον τῳ Απολλωνι βουλομενος εκ των κεφαλων οικοδομησαι. Mention is made of Lycaon, qui advenas
et hospites trucidavit. He is said to have founded the temple of Jupiter [764]Lycæus, and to have first introduced human sacrifices, particularly those of infants. Λυκαων δε επι τον βωμον τον
[765]Λυκαιου Διος βρεφος ηνεγκεν ανθρωπου, και εθυσε το βρεφος, και εσπεισεν επι του βωμου το ἁιμα. Lycaon was the person, who brought an infant, the offspring of a man, to the altar of Zeus Lucaios: and he slew the infant, and he sprinkled the altar with the blood which issued from it. Antinous in Homer threatens to send Irus to one Echetus, a king in Epirus, who was the dread of that
country. The same threat is uttered against [766]Ulysses, if he should presume to bend the bow, which Penelope had laid before the suitors. Under the character of Lycaon, Cycnus, &c. we are to understand Lycaonian and Cycnean priests; which latter were from Canaan: and this method of interpretation is to be observed all through these histories. Echetus, Εχετος, was a title of Apollo, rendered more
commonly [767]Ἑκατος by the Greeks, as if it came from the word ἑκας. It was an Amonian title by which Orus, and Osiris, were called: and this king Echetus was a priest of that family, who was named from the Deity, whom he served. The Poet styles him βροτων δηλημονα, from his cruelty to strangers.
[768]Πεμψω σ' Ηπειρονδε βαλων εν νηι μελαινῃ Εις Εχετον βασιληα, βροτων δηλημονα παντων. Ὁς κ' απο ῥινα ταμῃσι, και ουατα νηλεϊ χαλκῳ, Μηδεα τ' εξερυσας δωῃ κυσιν ωμα δασασθαι.
I'll send thee, caitiff, far beyond the seas, To the grim tyrant Echetus, who mars All he encounters; bane of human kind. Thine ears he'll lop, and pare the nose away From thy pale ghastly visage: dire to tell! The very parts, which modesty conceals, He'll tear relentless from the seat of life, To feed his hungry hounds.
When the Spaniards got access to the western world, there were to be observed many rites, and many terms, similar to those, which were so common among the sons of Ham. Among others was this particular custom of making the person, who was designed for a victim, engage in fight with a priest of the temple. In this manner he was slaughtered: and this procedure was esteemed a proper method of
[769]sacrifice.
The histories of which I have been speaking were founded in truth, though the personages are not real. Such customs did prevail in the first ages: and in consequence of these customs we find those beggarly attributes of wrestling and boxing conferred upon some of the chief Divinities. Hercules and Pollux were of that number, who were as imaginary beings, as any mentioned above: yet represented upon
earth as sturdy fellows, who righted some, and [770]wronged many. They were in short a kind of honourable Banditti, who would suffer nobody to do any mischief, but themselves. From these customs



were derived the Isthmian, Nemean, Pythic, and Olympic games, together with those at Delos. Of these last Homer gives a fine description in his Hymn to Apollo.
[771]Αλλα συ Δηλῳ, Φοιβε, μαλιστ' επιτερπεαι ητορ. Ενθα τοι ἑλκεχιτωνες Ιαονες ηγερεθονται, Αυτοις συν παιδεσσι, και αιδοιῃς αλοχοισι. Ὁιδε σε ΠYΓΜΑΧΙΗι τε, και ορχηθμῳ, και αοιδῃ Μνησαμενοι τερπουσιν, ὁταν στησωνται αγωνα.
These contentions had always in them something cruel, and savage: but in later times they were conducted with an appearance of equity. Of old the whole ceremony was a most unfair and barbarous process.
CAMPE CAMPI.
Another name for those Amonian temples was Campi, of the same analogy, and nearly of the same purport, as Arpi above-mentioned. It was in after times made to signify the parade before the temples, where they wrestled, and otherwise celebrated their sacred games; and was expressed Campus. When chariots came in fashion, these too were admitted within the precincts; and races of this sort introduced. Among the Latines the word Campus came to mean any open and level space; but among the Sicilians the true meaning was in some degree preserved. Καμπος—Ιπποδρομος, Σικυλοι. Hesychius. It was properly a place of exercise in general, and not confined to races. Hence a combatant was styled
[772]Campio, and the chief persons, who presided, [773]Campigeni. The exercise itself was by the Greeks styled αγων, αεθλος, ἁμιλλα; all Amonian terms, taken from the titles of the Deity, in whose honour the games were instituted. These temples partly from their symbols, and partly from their history, being misinterpreted, were by the antient mythologists represented as so many dragons and monsters. Nonnus mentions both Arpe, and Campe in this light, and says that the latter had fifty heads, each of some different beast,
[774]Ης απο δειρης Ηνθεε πεντηκοντα καρηατα ποικιλα θηρων.
But Campe was an oracular temple and inclosure, sacred to Ham or Cham: where people used to exercise. The fifty heads related to the number of the priests, who there resided; and who were esteemed as so many wild beasts for their cruelty. Nonnus makes Jupiter kill Campe: but Diodorus Siculus gives the honour to Dionusus; who is supposed to have slain this monster at Zaborna in Libya; and to have raised over her, χωμα παμμεγεθες, a vast mound of earth. This heap of soil was in reality a high place or altar; which in after times was taken for a place of burial. These inclosures grew by degrees into disrepute; and the history of them obsolete. In consequence of which the ταφοι, or mounds, were supposed to be the tombs of heroes. The Grecians, who took every history to themselves, imagined, that their Jupiter and Dionusus, and their Hercules had slain them. But what they took for tombs of enemies were in reality altars to these very Gods; who were not confined to Greece, nor of Grecian original. The Campanians in Italy were an antient Amonian colony; and they were denominated from Campe or Campus, which was probably the first temple, they erected. Stephanus Byzantinus shews, that there was of old such a place: Καμπος—κτισμα Καμπανου: but would insinuate that it took its name from a person the head of the colony. Eustathius more truly makes it give name to the people: though he is not sufficiently determinate. [775]Καμπανοι απο των ὑποκαθημενων εκει Καμπων ωνομασθησαν, η απο Καμπου πολεως. There were many of these Campi in Greece, which are styled by Pausanias
ὑπαιθρα, in contradistinction to the temples, which were covered. They are to be found in many parts of the world, where the Amonian religion obtained, which was propagated much farther than we are aware. In our island the exhibition of those manly sports in vogue among country people is called Camping: and the inclosures for that purpose, where they wrestle and contend, are called Camping closes. There are many of them in Cambridgeshire, as well as in other parts of the kingdom. In Germany we meet with the name of Kæmpenfelt; in which word there is no part derived from the Latin language: for the terms would then be synonymous, and one of them redundant. Kæmpenfelt was, I imagine, an antient name for a field of sports, and exercise, like the gymnasium of the Greeks: and a Camping place in Britain is of the like purport.



ANTIENT HEROES.
Καθολου δε φασιν (ὁι Αιγυπτιοι) τους Ἑλληνας εξιδιαζεσθαι τους επιφανεστατους Ἡρωας τε, και Θεους, ετι δε και αποικιας τας παρ' ἑαυτων. Diodorus Sicul. l. 1. p. 21.
It has been my uniform purpose, during the whole process, which I have made in my system, to shew, that the Grecians formed Deities out of titles; and that they often attributed to one person, what belonged to a people. And when they had completed the history, they generally took the merit of it to themselves. By means of this clue we may obtain an insight into some of the most remote, and the most obscure parts of antiquity. For many and great achievements have been attributed to heroes of the first ages, which it was not possible for them singly to have performed. And these actions, though in some degree diversified, and given to different personages, yet upon examination will be found to relate to one people or family; and to be at bottom one and the same history.
OSIRIS.
If we consider the history of Osiris, he will appear a wonderful conqueror, who travelled over the face
of the whole [776]earth, winning new territories, wherever he came; yet always to the advantage of those whom he subdued. He is said to have been the son of Rhea: and his chief attendants in his peregrinations were Pan, Anubis, Macedo, with Maro, a great planter of vines; also Triptolemus much skilled in husbandry. The people of India claimed Osiris, as their own; and maintained, that he was born
at Nusa in their [777]country. Others supposed his birth-place to have been at Nusa in [778]Arabia, where he first planted the vine. Many make him a native of Egypt: and mention the rout of his travels as commencing from that country through Arabia, and Ethiopia; and then to India, and the regions of the east. When he was arrived at the extremities of the ocean, he turned back, and passed through the upper
provinces of Asia, till he came to the Hellespont, which he crossed. He then entered [779]Thrace, with the King of which he had a severe encounter: yet he is said to have persevered in his rout westward, till he arrived at the fountains of the Ister. He was also in Italy, and Greece: from the former of which he expelled the giants near Phlegra in Campania. He visited many places upon the ocean: and though he is represented as at the head of an army; and his travels were attended with military operations; yet he is at the same time described with the Muses, and Sciences in his retinue. His march likewise was conducted with songs, and dances, and the sound of every instrument of music. He built cities in various parts;
particularly [780]Hecatompulos, which he denominated Theba, after the name of his mother. In every
region, whither he came, he is said to have instructed the people in [781]planting, and sowing, and other useful arts. He particularly introduced the vine: and where that was not adapted to the soil, he taught the
natives the use of ferment, and shewed them the way to make [782]wine of barley, little inferior to the
juice of the grape. He was esteemed a great blessing to the Egyptians both as a [783]Lawgiver, and a
King. He first built temples to the Gods: and was reputed a general benefactor of [784]mankind. After many years travel they represent him as returning to Egypt in great triumph, where after his death he was enshrined as a Deity. His Taphos, or high altar, was shewn in many places: in all which he in aftertimes was supposed to have been buried. The people of Memphis shewed one of them; whereon
was a sacred pillar, containing a detail of his life, and great actions, to the following purport. [785]My father was Cronus, the youngest of all the Gods. I am the king Osiris, who carried my arms over the face of the whole earth, till I arrived at the uninhabited parts of India. From thence I passed through the regions of the north to the fountain-head of the Ister. I visited also other remote countries; nor stopped till I came to the western ocean. I am the eldest son of Cronus; sprung from the genuine and respectable race of (Σωος) Sous, and am related to the fountain of day. There is not a nation upon earth, where I have not been; and to whose good I have not contributed.
This is a very curious piece of antient history: and it will be found to be in great measure true, if taken with this allowance, that what is here said to have been achieved by one person, was the work of many. Osiris was a title conferred upon more persons than one; by which means the history of the first ages has been in some degree confounded. In this description the Cuthites are alluded to, who carried on the expeditions here mentioned. They were one branch of the posterity of Ham; who is here spoken of as the eldest son of Cronus. How justly they conferred upon him this rank of primogeniture, I will not
determine. By [786]Cronus we are here to understand the same person, as is also represented under the name of Soüs. This would be more truly expressed Σωον, Soön; by which is meant the Sun: All the Amonian families affected to be styled Heliadæ, or the offspring of the Sun: and under this title they alluded to their great ancestor the father of all: as by Osiris they generally meant Ham. Σωον, Soön, is
the same as [787]Zoon, and Zoan, the fountain of day. The land of Zoan in Egypt was the nome of Heliopolis: and the city Zoan the place of the Sun. The person then styled here Soüs can be no other than the great Patriarch under a title of the Sun. He is accordingly by Philo Biblius called Ousoüs in an



extract from Sanchoniathon. He makes him indeed reside, where Tyre was afterwards built; but supposes him to have lived at a time, when there were great rains and storms; and to have been the first
constructor of a ship, and the first who ventured upon the [788]seas. In respect to the travels of Osiris we shall find that the posterity of Ham did traverse at different times the regions above-mentioned: and in many of them took up their abode. They built the city Memphis in Egypt; also Hecatompulos, which they denominated Theba, after the name of their reputed mother. They also built Zoan, the city of the Sun.
Osiris is a title often conferred upon the great patriarch himself: and there is no way to find out the person meant but by observing the history, which is subjoined. When we read of Osiris being exposed in an ark, and being afterward restored to day; of his planting the vine, and teaching mankind agriculture; and inculcating religion, and justice; the person alluded to stands too manifest to need any farther elucidation. And when it is said of Osiris, that he went over most parts of the habitable globe, and built cities in various regions; this too may be easily understood. It can allude to nothing else, but a people called Osirians, who traversed the regions mentioned. They were principally the Cuthites, who went abroad under various denominations: and the histories of all the great heroes, and heroïnes of the first ages will be found of the same purport, as the foregoing. Osiris is supposed to have been succeeded in
Egypt by Orus. After Orus came Thoules; who was succeeded by [789]Sesostris.
PERSEUS.
Perseus was one of the most antient heroes in the mythology of Greece: the merit of whose supposed achievements the Helladians took to themselves; and gave out that he was a native of Argos. He
travelled to the temple of [790]Ammon; and from thence traversed the whole extent of Africa. He
subdued the [791]Gorgons, who lived in Mauritania, and at Tartessus in Bœtica; and defeated the
Ethiopians upon the western ocean, and the nations about mount Atlas: which [792]mountain he only and Hercules are said to have passed. Being arrived at the extremity of the continent, he found means to pass over, and to get possession of all the western islands. He warred in the East; where he freed
[793]Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus king of the eastern Ethiopia, who was exposed to a sea
monster. Some imagine this to have happened at [794]Joppa in Palestine, where the [795]bones of this monster of an extraordinary size are supposed to have been for a long time preserved. He is said to have
built [796]Tarsus in Cilicia, reputed the most antient city in the world; and to have planted the peach tree
at [797]Memphis. The Persians were supposed to have been his descendants. He travelled through Asia
Minor, to the country of the [798]Hyperboreans upon the Ister, and the lake Mæotis; and from thence descended to Greece. Here he built Mycene, and Tiryns, said by many to have been the work of the Cyclopians. He established a seminary at Helicon: and was the founder of those families, which were styled Dorian, and Herculean. It is a doubt among writers, whether he came into Italy. Some of his family were there; who defeated the giant race in Campania, and who afterwards built Argiletum, and Ardea in Latium. Virgil supposes it to have been effected by Danae, the mother of this Hero:
[799]Ardea —— quam dicitur olim Acrisioneïs Danäe fundâsse colonis.
But [800]Servius says, that Perseus himself in his childhood was driven to the coast of Daunia. He is represented as the ancestor of the Grecian Hercules, supposed to have been born at Thebes in Bœotia. In
reality neither [801]Hercules, nor Perseus, was of Grecian original; notwithstanding the genealogies framed in that country. The history of the latter came apparently from Egypt, as we may learn from Diodorus[802]: Φασι δε και τον Περσεα γεγονεναι κατ' Αιγυπτον. Herodotus more truly
represents him as an [803]Assyrian; by which is meant a Babylonian: and agreeably to this he is said to
have married [804]Asterie, the daughter of Belus, the same as Astaroth and Astarte of Canaan; by whom he had a daughter Hecate. This, though taken from an idle system of theology, yet plainly shews, that the history of Perseus had been greatly misapplied and lowered, by being inserted among the fables of
Greece. Writers speak of him as a great [805]Astronomer, and a person of uncommon knowledge. He instructed mariners to direct their way in the sea by the lights of heaven; and particularly by the polar constellation. This he first observed, and gave it the name of Helice. Though he was represented as a Babylonian; yet he resided in Egypt, and is said to have reigned at Memphis. To say the truth, he was
worshipped at that place: for Perseus was a title of the Deity; [806]Περσευς, ὁ Ἡλιος; Perseus was no other than the Sun, the chief God of the Gentile world. On this account he had a temple of great repute
at [807]Chemmis, as well as at Memphis, and in other parts of Egypt. Upon the Heracleotic branch of the Nile, near the sea, was a celebrated watch-tower, denominated from him. His true name was Perez, or Parez, rendered Peresis, Perses, and Perseus: and in the account given of this personage we have the history of the Peresians, Parrhasians, and Perezites, in their several peregrinations; who were no other than the Heliadæ, and Osirians abovementioned. It is a mixed history, in which their forefathers are



alluded to; particularly their great progenitor, the father of mankind. He was supposed to have had a
renewal of life: they therefore described Perseus as inclosed in an
[808]
ark, and exposed in a state of childhood upon the waters, after having been conceived in a shower of gold.
Bochart thinks that the name both of Persis and Perseus was from פרס , Paras, an Horse: because the Persians were celebrated horsemen, and took great delight in that animal. But it must be considered that the name is very antient, and prior to this use of horses. P'aras, P'arez, and P'erez, however diversified, signify the Sun; and are of the same analogy as P'ur, P'urrhos, P'oros, which betoken fire. Every animal,
which was in any degree appropriated to a Deity, was called by some sacred
[809]
title. Hence an horse was called P'arez: and the same name, but without the prefix, was given to a lion by many nations in the east. It was at first only a mark of reference, and betokened a solar animal, specifying the particular Deity to whom it was sacred. There were many nations, which were distinguished in the same manner; some of whom the Greeks styled Parrhasians. Hence the antient Arcadians, those Selenitæ, who were undoubtedly an Amonian colony, had this appellation. A people in Elis had the same. The Poets described the constellation of Helice, or the Bear, by the title of Parrhasis, Arctos, and Parrhasis Ursa. This asterism was confessedly first taken notice of by Perez or Perseus, by which is meant the Persians.
[810]
Versaque ab axe suo Parrhasis Arctos erat.
In the east, where the worship of Arez greatly prevailed, there were to be found many nations called
after this manner. Part of Media, according to
[811]
Polybius, had the name of Parrhasia. There were also
Parrhasii and Parrhasini in
[812]
Sogdiana; and
[813]
the like near Caucasus: also a town named [814]
Parasinum in the Tauric Chersonesus. The people styled
[815]
Parrhasians in Greece were the same as the Dorians and Heraclidæ; all alike Cuthites, as were the antient Persians. Hence it is truly said by Plato, that the Heraclidæ in Greece, and the Achæmenidæ among the Persians were of the same stock: [816]
Το δε Ἡρακλεους τε γενος και το Αχαιμενεους εις Περσεα τον Διος αναφερεται. On
this account
[817]
Herodotus makes Xerxes claim kindred with the Argives of Greece, as being equally of the posterity of Perses, the same as Perseus, the Sun: under which character the Persians described the patriarch, from whom they were descended. Perseus was the same as Mithras, whose sacred cavern was styled Perseüm.
[818]
Phœbe parens—seu te roseum Titana vocari Gentis Achæmeniæ ritu; seu præstat Osirin Frugiferum; seu Persëi sub rupibus antri Indignata sequi torquentem cornua Mithram.
OF MYRINA,
AND THE
AMAZONIANS OF LIBYA.
From a notion that the Amazons were a community of women, historians have represented the chief
personage of their nation as a
[819]
female. She is mentioned by some as having flourished long before
the æra of
[820]
Troy: and it is by others said more precisely, that she lived in the time of Orus, the son of Isis and Osiris. This removes her history far back; so as to make it coeval with the first annals of time.
Her dominions lay in the most western parts of
[821]
Africa, at the extremity of Atlas; where the mountain terminated in the ocean, to which it gave name. This country was called Mauritania; and was supposed to have been possessed by the Atlantes and Gorgons. The Grecian writers, who did not know that the same family went under different titles, have often made the same nation at variance with itself. And as they imagined every migration to have been a warlike expedition, they have represented Myrina as making great conquests; and what is extraordinary, going over the same ground, only in a retrograde direction, which Osiris had just passed before. Her first engagement was with the Atlantes of Cercene: against whom she marched with an army of 30,000 foot, and 2,000 horse; whom she completely armed with the skins of serpents. Having defeated the Atlantes, she marched against the Gorgons, whom she
likewise
[822]
conquered; and proceeding forward, subdued the greater part of Africa, till she arrived at the borders of Egypt. Having entered into an alliance with Orus, she passed the Nile, and invaded the Arabians, whom she defeated. She then conquered the Syrians, and Cilicians, and all the nations about Mount Taurus; till she arrived at Phrygia, and the regions about the river Caïcus. Here she built many cities, particularly Cuma, Pitane, and Priene. She also got possession of several islands; and among others, of Lesbos and Samothracia, in which last she founded an asylum. After these transactions, Myrina, accompanied with Mopsus the diviner, made an expedition into Thrace, which was the ultimate of her progress; for she was supposed to have been here slain. According to Homer she died in Phrygia: for he takes notice of her tomb in the plains of Troas; and represents it as a notable performance.



[823]Εστι δε τις προπαροιθε πολεως αιπεια κολωνη, Εν πεδιῳ απανευθε, περιδρομος ενθα και ενθα· Την ητοι ανδρες Βατιειαν κικλησκουσιν, Αθανατοι δε τε σημα πολυσκαρθμοιο Μυρινης.
The tomb of this heroïne was in reality a sacred mound, or high altar; and Myrina a Gentile divinity. In her supposed conquests we may in great measure see the history of Osiris, and Perseus, reversed, and in some degree abridged; yet not so far varied, but that the purport may be plainly discerned. Indeed there is no other way to obtain the hidden meaning, but by collating the different histories, and bringing them in one view under the eye of the reader.
HERCULES.
Similar to the foregoing are the expeditions of Hercules, and the conquests which he is supposed to have performed. After many exploits in Greece, the reputed place of his nativity, he travelled as far as mount Caucasus near Colchis, to free Prometheus, who was there exposed to an eagle or vulture. Upon the Thermodon he engaged with the Amazons, whom he utterly defeated; and then passed over into Thrace. Upon his return into Greece he was ordered to make an expedition into Iberia, a region in the farthest part of Spain; where Chrusaor, a prince of great wealth, resided. Hercules accepts of the commission;
but, I know not for what reason, goes first to Crete, and from thence to [824]Libya; and what is extraordinary, proceeds to Egypt. This makes the plan of his supposed rout somewhat irregular and unaccountable. After some time spent in these parts, he builds the city Hecatompulos, said before to have been built by Osiris: and then traverses the whole of Africa westward, till he arrives at the Fretum Gaditanum. Here he erects two pillars; which being finished, he at last enters Iberia. He defeats the sons of Chrusaor, who were in arms to oppose him; and bestows their kingdom upon others. He likewise
seizes upon the oxen of Geryon. He then marches into the country of the Celtæ, and [825]founds the city
Corunna, and likewise [826]Alesia in Gaul. He afterwards fights with the giants Albion and Bergion near Arelate, in the plain styled Campus Lapideus; where are the salt waters of Salona. He then passes the
[827]Alpes; and upon the banks of the Eridanus encounters a person of shepherd race; whom he kills,
and seizes his [828]golden flocks. In his way homeward he visits Hetruria, and arrives at the mountain Palatinus upon the Tiber. From thence he goes to the maritime part of Campania, about Cuma, Heraclea, and the lake Aornon. Not far from hence was an adust and fiery region; supposed to have been the celebrated Phlegra, where the giants warred against heaven: in which war Hercules is said to have
[829]assisted. Here was an antient oracular temple; and hard by the mountain Vesuvius, which in those days flamed violently, though it did not for many ages afterwards. During his residence here he visited the hot fountains near Misenus and Dicæarchea; and made a large causeway, called in aftertimes Via Herculanea, and Agger Puteolanus. After having visited the Locrians, and the people of Rhegium, he crossed the sea to Sicily; which sea he swam over, holding by the horn of an ox. At his arrival some warm springs burst forth miraculously, to give him an opportunity of bathing. Here he boxed with Eryx; defeated the Sicani; and performed many other exploits. What is remarkable, having in Spain seized upon the cattle of Geryon, he is said to have made them travel over the Pyrenean mountains, and afterwards over the Alpes, into Italy; and from thence cross the sea into Sicily; and being now about to leave that island, he swims with them again to Rhegium: and ranging up the coast of the Adriatic, passes round to Illyria, from thence to Epirus; and so descends to Greece. The whole of these travels is said to have been completed in ten years.
He was also reported, according to [830]Megasthenes and others, to have made an expedition into
[831]India, and to have left many memorials of his transactions in those parts. He travelled likewise into
the region called afterwards Scythia; the natives of which country were his [832]descendants. He also visited the Hyperboreans. In all these peregrinations he is generally described as proceeding alone: at least we have no intimation of any army to assist in the performance of these great enterprises. He is
indeed supposed to have sailed with six ships to [833]Phrygia: but how he came by them is not said; nor whence he raised the men, who went with him. At other times he is represented with a club in his hand, and the skin of an animal upon his shoulders. When he passed over the ocean, he is said to have been
wafted in a golden [834]bowl. In Phrygia he freed Hesione from a Cetus, or sea monster, just as Perseus delivered Andromeda. He is mentioned as founding many cities in parts very remote: the sea-coast of
Bœtica, and Cantabria, was, according to some writers, peopled by [835]him. By Syncellus he is said to
have resided in Italy, and to have reigned in [836]Latium. The Grecians supposed that he was burnt upon
Mount Œta: but the people of Gades shewed his Taphos in their [837]city, just as the Egyptians shewed the Taphos of Osiris at Memphis, and elsewhere. Hence it was imagined by many, that Hercules was buried at Gades. The philosopher Megaclides could not be brought to give the least assent to the
histories of this [838]hero: and Strabo seems to have thought a great part of them to have been a
[839]fable. In short, the whole account of this personage is very inconsistent: and though writers have



tried to compromise matters by supposing more persons than one of this name, yet the whole is still incredible, and can never be so adjusted as to merit the least belief. How they multiplied the same Deity, in order to remedy their faulty mythology, may be seen in the following extract from Cicero.
[840]Quanquam, quem potissimum Herculem colamus, scire velim: plures enim nobis tradunt ii, qui interiores scrutantur et reconditas literas. Antiquissimum Jove natum, sed item Jove antiquissimo: nam Joves quoque plures in priscis Græcorum literis invenimus. Ex eo igitur et Lysito est is Hercules, quem concertâsse cum Apolline de tripode accepimus. Alter traditur Nilo natus, Ægyptius; quem aiunt Phrygias literas conscripsisse. Tertius est ex Idæis Dactylis, cui inferias afferunt. Quartus Jovis est, et Asteriæ, Latonæ sororis, quem Tyrii maxime colunt; cujus Carthaginem filium ferunt. Quintus in
[841]Indiâ, qui Belus dicitur. Sextus hic, ex Alcumenâ quem Jupiter genuit; sed tertius Jupiter: quoniam, ut docebo, plures Joves accepimus.
Hercules was a title given to the chief deity of the Gentiles, who have been multiplied into almost as many personages, as there were countries, where he was worshipped. What has been attributed to this god singly, was the work of Herculeans; a people who went under this title among the many which they assumed; and who were the same as the Osirians, Peresians, and Cuthites. They built Tartessus in
Bœtica, and occupied great part of Iberia. They likewise founded [842]Corunna in Cantabria, and
[843]Alesia in Gaul: of which there are traditions to this day. Some of them settled near [844]Arelate;
others among the [845]Alpes: also at Cuma, and Heraclea in Campania. They were also to be found at
Tyre, and in Egypt; and even in the remotest parts of [846]India. In short, wherever there were Heraclidæ, or Herculeans, an Hercules has been supposed. Hence his character has been variously represented. One, while he appears little better than a sturdy vagrant; at other times he is mentioned as a
great benefactor; also as the patron of science, the [847]God of eloquence, with the Muses in his train.
On this account he had the title of [848]Musagetes; and the Roman general Fulvius dedicated a temple
which he had erected to his honour, and inscribed it [849]Herculi Musarum. There are gems, upon which
he is represented as presiding among the Deities of [850]Science. He is said to have been swallowed by a Cetus, or large fish, from which he was after some time delivered. This history will hereafter be easily
decyphered. He was the chief deity of the [851]Gentile world; the same as Hermes, Osiris, and Dionusus; and his rites were introduced into various parts by the Cuthites. In the detail of his peregrinations is contained, in great measure, an history of that people, and of their settlements. Each of these the Greeks have described as a warlike expedition; and have taken the glory of it to themselves. He is said to have
had many sons. One of these was [852]Archemagoras; by which is meant the father or chief of the Magi.
There are many others enumerated: the principal of whom are said to have been; [853]Sardus, or Sardon; Cyrnus, Gelonus, Olynthus, Scythus, Galathus, Lydus, Iberus, Celtus, Poimen. As these are all manifestly the names of nations, we may perceive by the purport of this history, that the Sardinians, Corsicans, Iberians, Celtæ, Galatæ, Scythæ, &c. &c. together with those styled Shepherds, were
Herculeans; all descended from that [854]Hercules, who was the father of Archemagoras the chief of the Magi.
DIONUSUS.
The history of Dionusus is closely connected with that of Bacchus, though they were two distinct
persons. It is said of the former, that he was born at [855]Nusa in Arabia: but the people upon the Indus
insisted, that he was a native of their [856]country; and that the city Nusa, near mount Meru, was the true place of his birth. There were, however, some among them, who allowed, that he came into their parts from the west; and that his arrival was in the most antient times. He taught the nations, whither he came, to build and to plant, and to enter into societies. To effect this, he collected the various families out of the villages in which they dwelt, and made them incorporate in towns and cities, which he built in the most commodious situations. After they were thus established, he gave them laws, and instructed them in the worship of the Gods. He also taught them to plant the Vine, and to extract the juice of the grape;
together with much other salutary knowledge. This he did throughout all his [857]travels, till he had conquered every region in the East. Nor was it in these parts only, that he shewed himself so beneficent
a conqueror; but over all the habitable [858]world. The account given by the Egyptians is consonant to that of the Indians: only they suppose him to have been of their own country; and to have set out by the way of Arabia and the Red Sea, till he arrived at the extremities of the East. He travelled also into
[859]Lybia, quite to the Atlantic; of which performance Thymætes is said to have given an account in an antient Phrygian poem. After his Indian expedition, which took him up three years, he passed from Asia by the Hellespont into Thrace, where Lycurgus withstood him, and at last put him to flight. He came into Greece; and was there adopted by the people, and represented as a native of their country. He visited many places upon the Mediterranean; especially Campania, and the coast of Italy, where he was
taken prisoner by the Hetrurian pirates. Others say, that he conquered all [860]Hetruria. He had many attendants; among whom were the Tityri, Satyri, Thyades, and Amazons. The whole of his history is very inconsistent in respect both to time and place. Writers therefore have tried to remedy this by



introducing different people of the same name. Hence Dionusus is multiplied into as many
[861]personages as Hercules. His history was looked upon as very interesting; and therefore was the
chief theme of all the antient [862]bards. His flight, styled φυγη Διονυσου, was particularly
[863]recorded. He was the same as Osiris; and many of the later mythologists acknowledged this truth. Αιγυπτιοι μεν γαρ τον παρ' αυτοις θεον Οσιριν ονομαζομενον φασιν ειναι τον παρ' Ἑλλησι Διονυσον τουτον δε μυθολογουσιν επελθειν πασαν την οικουμενην—Ὁμοιως δε και τους Ινδους τον θεον τουτον παρ' ἑαυτοις αποφανεσθαι γεγονεναι. The Egyptians, says
[864]Diodorus, maintain that their God Osiris is no other than the Dionusus of Greece: And they farther mention, that he travelled over the face of the whole earth—In like manner the Indi assure us, that it is
the same Deity, who wan conversant in their [865]country.
Dionusus, according to the Grecian mythology, is represented as having been twice born: and is said to
have had two fathers and two mothers. He was also exposed in an [866]ark, and wonderfully preserved. The purport of which histories is plain. We must however for the most part consider the account given of Dionusus, as the history of the Dionusians. This is twofold. Part relates to their rites and religion; in which the great events of the infant world, and the preservation of mankind in general, were recorded. In the other part, which contains the expeditions and conquests of this personage, are enumerated the various colonies of the people, who were denominated from him. They were the same as the Osirians and Herculeans; all of one family, though under different appellations. I have shewn, that there were many places which claimed his birth; and as many, where was shewn the spot of his interment. Of these we may find samples in Egypt, Arabia, and India; as well as in Africa, Greece, and its islands. For the Grecians, wherever they met with a grot or a cavern sacred to him, took it for granted that he was born
there: and wherever he had a taphos, or high altar, supposed that he was there [867]buried. The same is also observable in the history of all the Gods.
From what has been said we may perceive that the same history has been appropriated to different personages: and if we look farther into the annals of the first ages, we shall find more instances to the
same purpose. It is said of [868]Cronus, and Astarte, that they went over the whole earth; disposing of the countries at their pleasure, and doing good wherever they came. Cronus in consequence of it is
represented as an universal [869]benefactor; who reclaimed men from their savage way of life, and taught them to pass their days in innocence and truth. A like account is given of Ouranus, the great king
of the [870]Atlantians, who observing mankind in an unsettled and barbarous state, set about building cities for their reception; and rendered them more humane and civilized by his institutions and laws. His influence was very extensive; as he is supposed to have had the greater part of the world under his rule. All this, and what was above done by Cronus and Astarte, the Grecians attributed to Apollo and Themis. Strabo mentions from the historian, Ephorus, that the oracle at Delphi was founded by these two
[871]deities at the time, when Apollo was going over the world doing good to all mankind. He taught the
nations, where he came, to be more [872]gentle and humane in their manners; and to abstain from their wild fruits, and foul banquets: affording them instructions how to improve themselves by cultivation.
Some of these persons are mentioned as proceeding in a pacific manner: but these peregrinations in general are represented as a process of war; and all that was effected, was supposed to have been by conquest. Thus Osiris, Hercules, Perseus, Dionusus, displayed their benevolence sword in hand: and laid every country under an obligation to the limits of the earth. The like is said of Zeuth, the Zeus of
Greece, who was an universal conqueror and benefactor: [873]Τον Δια κυριον γενομενον τον ὁλων επελθειν ἁπασαν την οικουμενην, ευεργετουντα το γενος των ανθρωπων· διενεγκειν δε αυτον και σωματος ῥωμῃ και ταις αλλαις ἁπασαις αρεταις, και δια τουτο ταχυ κυριον γενεσθαι του συμπαντος κοσμου. Zeus (or Jupiter) having got the entire supremacy marched over the whole earth, benefiting mankind wherever he came. And as he was a person of great bodily strength, and at the same time had every princely quality, he very soon subdued the whole world.
No mention is made of any conquests achieved by Orus: and tho reason is, because he was the same as Osiris. Indeed they were all the same personage: but Orus was more particularly Osiris in his second state; and therefore represented by the antient Egyptians as a child. What is omitted by him, was made up by his immediate successor Thoules; who like those, who preceded, conquered every country which was inhabited. [874]Ειτα Οσιρις, μεθ' ὁν Ωρος, και μετα αυτον Θουλης, ὁς και ἑως του ωκεανου πασαν την γην παρειληφεν. After him (that is, Söus, or Sosis,) came Osiris; and then Orus: to whom succeeded Thoules, who conquered the whole earth quite to the ocean. The like history
is given of him by [875]Suidas, and by the author of the [876]Chronicon Paschale.
These accounts I have collated, and brought in succession to one another; that we may at a view see the absurdity of the history, if taken in the common acceptation. And however numerous my instances may have been, I shall introduce other examples before I quit the subject. I must particularly speak of an Egyptian hero, equally ideal with those abovementioned; whose history, though the most romantic and



improbable of any, has been admitted as credible and true. The person to whom I allude, is the celebrated Sesostris. Most of the antient historians speak of his great achievements; and the most learned of the modern chronologists have endeavoured to determine his æra, and point out the time of his reign. But their endeavours have been fruitless; and they vary about the time when he lived not less than a thousand years: nay, some differ even more than this in the æra, which they assign to him.
SESOSTRIS.
Among the writers who have written concerning this extraordinary personage, Diodorus Siculus is the
most uniform and full; and with his evidence I will begin my account. He[877] informs us, that, when this prince was a youth, he was entrusted by his father with a great army. He upon this invaded Arabia: and though he was obliged to encounter hunger and thirst in the wilds, which he traversed; yet he subdued the whole of that large tract of country. He was afterwards sent far into the west; where he conquered all the legions of Lybia, and annexed great part of that country to the kingdom of Egypt. After the death of his father he formed a resolution to subdue all the nations upon earth. Accordingly, having settled everything at home, and appointed governors to each province, he set out with an army of six hundred thousand foot, and twenty-four thousand horse, and twenty-seven thousand armed chariots. With these he invaded the Ethiopians to the south; whom he defeated, and made tributaries to Egypt. He then built a fleet of ships upon the Red sea: and he is recorded as the first person who constructed vessels fit for distant navigation. With these, by means of his generals, he subdued all the sea-coast of Arabia, and all the coast upon the ocean as far as India. In the mean time he marched in person, with a puissant army, by land, and conquered the whole continent of Asia. He not only overran the countries, which Alexander afterwards invaded; but crossed both the Indus and the Ganges; and from thence penetrated to the eastern ocean. He then turned to the north, and attacked the nations of Scythia; till he at last arrived at the Tanäis, which divides Europe and Asia. Here he founded a colony; leaving behind
him some of his people, as he had just before done at [878]Colchis. These nations are said to the last to have retained memorials of their original from Egypt. About the same time Asia Minor, and most of the
islands near it, fell into his hands. He at last passed into [879]Thrace, where he is said to have been brought into some difficulties. He however persisted, and subdued all the regions of Europe. In most of these countries he erected pillars with hieroglyphical inscriptions; denoting that these parts of the world
had been subdued by the great Sesostris, or, as [880]Diodorus expresses his name, Sesoosis. He likewise erected statues of himself, formed of stone, with a bow and a lance: which statues were in length four cubits and four palms, according to the dimensions of his own height and stature. Having thus finished
his career of [881]victory, he returned laden with spoils to Egypt, after an absence of [882]nine years; which is one year less than was attributed to the expeditions of Hercules.
The detail given by this historian is very plain and precise: and we proceed very regularly and minutely in a geographical series from one conquest to another: so that the story is rendered in some degree plausible. But we may learn from Diodorus himself, that little credit is to be paid to this narration, after all the pains he may have taken to win upon our credulity. He ingenuously owns, that not only the Grecian writers, but even the priests of Egypt, and the bards of the same country varied in the accounts which they gave of this hero; and were guilty of great inconsistence. It was therefore his chief labour to collect what he thought most credible, and what appeared most consonant to the memorials in Egypt, which time had spared: [883]Τα πιθανωτατα, και τοις υπαρχουσιν ετι κατα την χωραν σημειοις τα μαλιστα συμφωνουντα διελθειν. But, as these memorials consisted chiefly in hieroglyphics, I do not see how it was possible for Diodorus to understand what the bards and priests could not decypher. The adjustment of this history, had it been practicable, should have been the work of a native Egyptian, and not of a person either from Greece or Sicily. This writer afterwards mentions
the mighty [884]works of Sesostris upon his return into Egypt: the temples which he built, and the great entrenchments which he made to the east, to guard the country from the Arabians: and having
enumerated the whole of his actions, he concludes with an ingenuous confession, that [885]little could be obtained that was precisely true. He has, without doubt, culled the most probable achievements of this hero; and coloured and arranged them to the best advantage: yet they still exceed belief. And if, after this care and disposition, they seem incredible, how would they appear in the garb, in which he found
them? Yet the history of this personage has been admitted as credible by the most learned [886]writers and chronologists: though, as I before mentioned, they cannot determine the æra of his reign within a thousand years. Sir John Marsham and Sir Isaac Newton suppose him to have been the Sesac of the scriptures; and consequently bring his reign down to the time of Rehoboam king of Judah. But the only reason for this, as far as I can perceive, seems to be, that Sesostris is represented as a great conqueror;
and Sesac is presumed, from his large [887]army, to have been so likewise. But there is nothing more said of Sesac, than that he formed a plan of conquering the king of Judah; and accordingly came with
the army before mentioned, to put his design in execution. But the [888]capital being delivered into his hands without the least resistance, and the king intirely submitting himself to his will; he contented himself with the rich plunder, which he found, and which he carried away at his departure. We may also



infer from the servitude, to which the people of Judah were reduced, that he imposed upon them some future contributions.
This is the whole of the history of Sesac, or Shishak; by whom no other expedition was undertaken that we know of: nor is there mention made upon record of a single battle which he fought. Yet from a notion that Sesac was a great warrior, he is made the same as Sesostris: and the age of the latter is brought down very many centuries beneath the æra, to which the best writers have adjudged it. When we differ from received tradition, we should not pass over in silence what is said on the contrary part; but give it at large, and then shew our reasons for our departure from it. I have taken notice of the supposed conquerors of the earth: and among them of the reputed deities of Egypt, who came under the names of Osiris, Perseus, Thoules, &c. These are supposed, if they ever existed, to have lived in the first ages of the world, when Egypt was in its infant state; and Sesostris is made one of their number. He is by some placed after Orus; by others after Thoules; but still referred to the first ages. He is represented
under the name of Sethos, [889]Sethosis, Sesoosis, Sesonchosis, Sesostris; but the history, with which these names are accompanied, shews plainly the identity of the personage. Eusebius in reckoning up the dynasty of kings, who reigned after Hephaistus or Vulcan, mentions them in the following order:
[890]Then succeeded his son Helius; after him Sosis, then Osiris, then Orus, then Thoules, who
conquered the whole earth to the ocean; and last of all Sesostris. The [891]Scholiast upon Apollonius Rhodius calls him Sesonchosis; and places him immediately after Orus, and the third in succession from Osiris: giving at the same time an account of his conquests. He adds that he was the person whom Theopompus called Sesostris. The same Scholiast quotes a curious passage from Dicæarchus, in which
Sesonchosis maintains the same rank, and was consequently of the highest antiquity. [892]Dicæarchus in the first book of his history mentions, that immediately after the reign of Orus, the son of Isis and Osiris, in Egypt, the government devolved to Sesonchosis: so that from the time of Sesonchosis to Nilus were
two thousand years. Cedrenus [893]calls him Sesostris; and mentions him after Osiris, and Orus, and Thoules; which last was by the above writer omitted. Οσιρις. Ωρος. Θουλης. μετα δε τουτον
Σεσωστρις. The author of the Chronicon Paschale makes Orus to have been succeeded by the same personage, as is mentioned above, whom he calls Thoulis; and next to him introduces Sesostris. He relates all his great conquests; and gives us this farther information, that this prince was the first of the
line of Ham, who reigned in Egypt; in other words, he was the first king of the country. [894]Εν τουτοις μετα ταυτα χρονοις εβασιλευε των Αιγυπτιων πρωτος εκ τες φυλης ΤΟΥ ΧΑΜ
[895]Σεσωστρις. Aristotle speaks of Sesostris; but does not determine the time of his reign on account
of its great antiquity. He only says that it was long before the age of [896]Minos, who was supposed to have reigned in Crete. Apollonius Rhodius, who is thought to have been a native of Egypt, speaks of the great actions of this prince; but mentions no name: not knowing, I imagine, by which properly to distinguish him, as he was represented under so many. He however attributes to him every thing which
is said of [897]Sesostris; particularly the settling a Colony at Colchis, and building innumerable cities in the countries which he traversed:
μυρια δ' αστη Νασσατ' εποιχομενος.
He represents him as conquering all Asia and Europe; and this in times so remote, that many of the cities which he built, were in ruins before the æra of the Argonauts.
From what has been said, we may perceive that if such a person as Sesostris had existed, his reign must have been of the earliest date. He is by some represented as succeeding Thoules: according to others he
comes one degree higher, being introduced after [898]Orus, who in the catalogue of Panodorus is placed
first of the Demigods, that reigned in Egypt; but by [899]Herodotus is ranked among the deities. According to Dicæarchus the reign of Sesostris was two thousand five hundred years before Nilus: and the reign of the latter was four hundred and thirty-six years before the first Olympiad. I do not place the least confidence in these computations; but would only shew from them that the person spoken of must be referred to the mythic age, to the æra of the Demigods of Egypt. Some of these evidences are taken
notice of by Sir John [900]Marsham; who cannot extricate himself from the difficulties with which his system is attended. He has taken for granted, that Sesostris and Sesonchosis are the Sesac of the
Scriptures; though every circumstance of their history is repugnant to that notion. [901]I know not, says he, what to make of this Sesonchosis; who is represented as five thousand years before Menes, and who is referred to the time of the Demigods. In another place: Sesostris, who is in the twelfth Dynasty of Africanus, and whose æra extends higher, than the Canon of Eusebius reaches, reigned according to Scaliger's computation in the 1392d year of the Julian Period. By this calculation Sesostris is made prior to Sesostris; and this too by no less than 2355 years: for it is manifest, as I will shew from Scripture, that Sesostris undertook his expedition into Asia, and got possession of Jerusalem in the 3747th year of the Period abovementioned. What is said in the sacred writings, I have taken notice of before. Not a word occurs about Sesostris, nor of any such Asiatic expedition. I am obliged to say, that



through the whole of this learned writer's process, instead of a proof, we find nothing else but the question begged, and some inferences of his own in consequence of this assumption. He indeed quotes the authority of Manethon from Josephus to prove that the great actions of Sesostris were the same as were performed by Sesac. But Manethon says no such thing: nor does Josephus attribute any such exploits to Sesac: but expressly says more than once, that Sesac, and Sesostris were two different
[902]persons. It is no where said of Sesac, that he made an expedition into Asia; much less that he conquered it, as is supposed of Sesostris. Sesac went up against Jerusalem, and took it, αμαχητι, without meeting with any opposition. Upon this he departed, and carried with him the treasures which he had there seized: in other words, he went home again. There is not the least mention made of his
invading [903]Samaria, or the country about Libanus, and Sidon; or of his marching to Syria: all which made but a small part of the great Continent, called in aftertimes Asia: much less did he visit the countries of the Assyrians, and Babylonians; or the regions of Elam and the Medes. All this, and much more he must have done, to have come up to the character, to which they would fain entitle him.
I will not enter into any farther discussion of the great conquests attributed to this supposed monarch Sesostris. They are as ideal as those of Sesac, and sufficiently confute themselves. First Osiris is said to
have conquered the whole earth: then Zeus, then Perseus, then [904]Hercules, all nearly of the same degree of antiquity, if we may believe the best Mythologists. Myrina comes in for a share of conquest in the time of Orus. After her Thoules subdues the whole from the Eastern Ocean, to the great Atlantic: and as if nothing had been performed before, Sesostris immediately succeeds, and conquers it over
again. [905]Herodotus informs us, as a token of these victories, that Sesostris erected pillars and obelisks with emblematical inscriptions: and that he saw some of them in Phrygia, and in other countries, which had been conquered. He without doubt saw pillars: but how did he know for certain, by whom they were
erected? and who taught him to interpret the symbols? Pausanias takes [906]notice of a colossal statue in the Thebäis, and says that the history given of it was not satisfactory. He tells us, that it stood near the Syringes, in upper Egypt; and he viewed it with great admiration. It was the figure of a man in a sitting posture; which some said was the representation of Memnon the Ethiopian: others maintained, that it was the statue of Phamenophis: and others again, that it related to Sesostris. There were here emblems, and symbols; yet a diversity of opinions. I want therefore to know, how Herodotus could interpret in Phrygia, what a native could not decypher in Egypt. The same question may be asked about the people of Syria, among whom were obelisks attributed to the same person. How came they to be so determinate about an Egyptian work; when people of that country in the same circumstances were so utterly at a loss? the whole undoubtedly was matter of surmise. I shall not therefore say any thing more of Sesostris; as I must again speak of him, when I come to the kings of Egypt.
If we compare the above histories, we may perceive that they bear a manifest similitude to one another; though they are attributed to different persons. They contain accounts of great achievements in the first ages: in effecting which these antient heroes are represented as traversing immense regions, and carrying their arms to the very limits of the known world: the great Tartarian ocean to the east, and the Atlantic westward, being the boundaries of their travel. Some of them seem to have been of the same age; and to have carried on these conquests at nearly the same time: and those, whose æra may possibly differ, have this in common with the others; that they visit the same countries, march for the most part by the same rout; and are often joined by the same allies, and are followed by the like attendants. They are in general esteemed benefactors, wherever they go: and carry the sciences with them, as well as their religious rites; in which they instruct the natives in different parts of the world. These are to be sure noble occurrences; which however could not possibly have happened, as they are represented above. It is not to be supposed, that any person in those early ages, or in any age, could go over such a tract of country; much less that he should subdue it. It is still more improbable, that such extensive conquests should be so immediately repeated: and that they should in some instances be carried on by different people at nearly the same time. They, who speak of mighty empires being founded in those early days, know little of true history; and have formed a very wrong judgment of the politics, which then universally prevailed. The whole earth, as far as we can learn, was divided into little coördinate states: every city seems to have been subservient to its own Judge and Ruler, and independent of all others. In
the land of [907]Canaan thirty-one kings were subdued by Joshua, between Jordan and the sea: and some were still left by him unconquered. In those days, says the learned Marsham, quot urbes, tot regna. The like was for many ages after observable in Greece, as well as in Latham, Samnium, and Hetruria. A powerful enemy made Egypt unite under one head: and the necessities of the people in a time of dearth served to complete that system. The Israelites too, when settled in Canaan, formed a large kingdom. Excepting these two nations we know of none of any considerable extent, that were thus united. The
[908]Syrians and the Philistim were in separate states, and under different governors. The kingdoms of Nineve and Babylonia consisted each of one mighty city, with its environs; in which were perhaps
included some subordinate villages. They were properly walled [909]Provinces; and the inhabitants were in a state of rest for ages. The Assyrian did not till about seven hundred years before Christ, begin to contend for dominion, and make acquisition of territory: and we may form a judgment, from what he
then [910]gained, of what he was possessed before. The cities Hala, Habor, Haran in Mesopotamia, with Carchemish upon the Euphrates, were his first conquests: to these he added the puny states Ina, Iva, and



Sepharvaim upon the same river. He then proceeded to Hamath, Damascus, and other cities of Syria; and at last came to Samaria. The line of conquest points out the route, which he took; and shews that there were in Mesopotamia numberless little states, independent of Babylon and Nineve, though in their immediate vicinity. Consequently the notion of the extent, dominion, and antiquity of those Monarchies, as delivered by Ctesias and others, is entirely void of truth. The conquests likewise of those Heroes and Demigods, who are made coeval with the supposed foundations of those Monarchies, must be equally groundless. To say the truth, the very personages are ideal, and have been formed out of the titles of the Deity: and the history, with which they are attended, related not to conquest, but to peregrinations of another nature; to Colonies which went abroad, and settled in the countries mentioned. The antients, as I have repeatedly said, have given to a person, what related to a people: and if we make this small allowance, the history will be found in great measure true.
NINUS SEMIRAMIS.
Having given an account of the mythic heroes of Egypt, I think it necessary to subjoin an history of two others of the like stamp, who have made no less figure in the annals of Babylon and Assyria. The persons, to whom I allude, are Ninus and Semiramis; whose conquests, though they did not extend so far as those above, are yet alike wonderful, and equally groundless. It is said of Ninus, that he was the
first king of [911]Assyria: and being a prince of great power, he made war on his neighbours the Babylonians, whom he conquered. He afterwards invaded the Armenians; whose king Barsanes, finding himself much inferior to his adversary, diverted his anger by great presents, and a voluntary
[912]submission. The next object of his ambition was Media, which he soon subdued; and getting Phanius, the king of the country, into his hands, together with his wife and seven children, he condemned them all to be crucified. His hopes being greatly raised by this success, he proceeded to reduce all the nations to his obedience between the Tanaïs and the Nile: and in seventeen years he made so great a progress, that, excepting Bactria, all Asia submitted to him as far as the river Indus. In the series of conquered countries Ctesias enumerates Egypt, Phenicia, Coile Syria, Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lycia, Caria, Phrygia, Mysia, Lydia, Cappadocia, and the nations in Pontus, and those near the Tanaïs. To these are added the Dacians, Hyrcanians, Derbicians, Carmanians, Parthians, with all Persis and Susiana, and the numerous nations upon the Caspian sea. After these notable actions he laid the foundation of the great city Nineve: which by mistake is said to have been built upon the banks of the
[913]Euphrates. His last expedition was against the Bactrians: at which time he first saw Semiramis, a woman of uncommon endowments, and great personal charms. He had an army which amounted to seven millions of foot, and two millions of horse, with two hundred thousand chariots with scythes. For the possibility of which circumstances Diodorus tries to account in favour of the historian, from whom he borrows. By the conduct of Semiramis the Bactrians are subdued; and Ninus takes the capital of the country: upon which, in return for her services, he makes Semiramis his queen. Not long after he dies, leaving only one son by this princess, who was called Ninyas.
The history of Semiramis is variously related by different authors. Some make her a native of Ascalon; and say that she was exposed in the desert, and nourished by pigeons. She was in this situation discovered by a shepherd named Simma. He bred her up, and married her to Menon; whom she deserted for Ninus. During her son's minority she assumed the regal state: and the first work which she undertook was the interment of her husband. She accordingly buried him with great splendor; and raised over him a mound of earth, no less than a mile and a quarter high, and proportionally wide at bottom: after which she built Babylon. This being finished, she made an expedition into Media; and wherever she came left memorials of her power and munificence. This was effected by erecting vast structures, forming lakes, and laying out gardens of great extent; particularly in Chaonia and Ecbatana. In short, she levelled hills,
and raised [914]mounds of an immense height, which retained her name for ages. After this she invaded Egypt, and conquered Ethiopia, with the greater part of Lybia: and having accomplished her wish, and there being no enemy to cope with her, excepting the people of India, she resolved to direct her forces towards that quarter. She had an army of three millions of foot, five hundred thousand horse, and one hundred thousand chariots. For the passing of rivers, and engaging with the enemy by water, she had procured two thousand ships, to be so constructed as to be taken to pieces for the advantage of carriage: which ships were built in Bactria by experienced persons from Phenicia, Syria, and Cyprus. With these she entered into a naval engagement with Strabrobates king of India; and at the first encounter sunk a thousand of his ships. Upon this she built a bridge over the river Indus, and penetrated into the heart of the country. Here Strabrobates engaged her; but being deceived by the numerous appearance of her elephants, at first gave way. For being deficient in those animals, she had procured the hides of three thousand black oxen; which being properly sewed, and stuffed with straw, formed an appearance of so many elephants. All this was done so naturally, that the real animals could not stand the sight. But this stratagem being at last discovered, Semiramis was obliged to retreat, after having lost a great part of her
[915]army. Soon after this she resigned the government to her son Ninyas, and died. According to some writers, she was slain by his hand.
The history of Ninus and Semiramis, as here represented, is in great measure founded upon terms, which have been misconstrued; and these fictions have been invented in consequence of the mistakes.



Under the character of Semiramis we are certainly to understand a people styled Semarim, a title assumed by the antient Babylonians. They were called Semarim from their insigne, which was a dove, expressed Semaramas, of which I shall speak hereafter more at large. It was used as an object of
worship; and esteemed the same as Rhea, the mother of the gods: [916]Σεμιραμιν και την Ῥεαν καλουμενην παρ' Ασσυριοις.
If we take the history of Semiramis, as it is given us by Ctesias and others; nothing can be more
inconsistent. Some make her the wife of Ninus: others say that she was his [917]daughter: and about the time of her birth they vary beyond measure. She is sometimes made cöeval with the city Nineve: at
other times she is brought down within a few centuries of [918]Herodotus. She invades the Babylonians
before the city was [919]built, from whence they were denominated: and makes sumptuous gardens at Ecbatana. Hence that city is introduced as coëval with Nineve: though, if the least credit may be given
to [920]Herodotus, it was built many ages after by Deïoces the Mede. The city Nineve itself is by Ctesias
placed upon the [921]Euphrates; though every other writer agrees, that it lay far to the east, and was situated upon the Tigris. This shews how little credit is to be paid to Ctesias. The whole account of the fleet of ships built in Bactria, and carried upon camels to the Indus, is a childish forgery. How can we suppose, that there were no woods to construct such vessels, but in the most inland regions of Asia? The story of the fictitious elephants, made out of the hides of black oxen, which put to flight the real elephants, is another silly fable. Megasthenes, who wrote of India, would not allow that Semiramis was
ever in those [922]parts. Arrian seems to speak of it as a groundless [923]surmise. Her building of
Babylon was by [924]Berosus treated as a fable. Herennius Philo maintained, that it was built by a son of
Belus the wise, two thousand years before her [925]birth. Suidas says, that she called Nineve
[926]Babylon: so uncertain is every circumstance about this Heroine. She is supposed to have sent to Cyprus, and Phenicia, for artists to construct and manage the ships abovementioned; as if there had been people in those parts famous for navigation before the foundation of Nineve. They sometimes give to
Semiramis herself the merit of building the [927]first ship; and likewise the invention of weaving cotton:
and another invention more extraordinary, which was that of emasculating [928]men, that they might be guardians, and overseers in her service. Yet, it is said of her, that she took a man to her bed every night, whom she put to death in the morning. How can it be imagined, if she was a woman of such unbridled
[929]lust, that she would admit such spies upon her actions? We may as well suppose, that a felon would forge his own gyves, and construct his own prison. Claudian thinks, that she did it to conceal her own sex, by having a set of beardless people about her.
[930]Seu prima Semiramis astu Assyriis mentita virum, ne vocis acutæ Mollities, levesque genæ se prodere possent, Hos sibi junxisset socios: seu Parthica ferro Luxuries nasci vetuit lanuginis umbram; Servatosque diu puerili flore coegit Arte retardatam Veneri servire juventam.
In respect to Semiramis I do not see how this expedient could avail. She might just as well have dressed up her maids in mens clothes, and with less trouble. In short the whole of these histories in their common acceptation is to the last degree absurd, and improbable: but if we make use of an expedient, which I have often recommended, and for a person substitute a people, we shall find, when it is stripped of its false colouring, that there is much truth in the narration.
It was a common mode of expression to call a tribe or family by the name of its founder: and a nation by the head of the line. People are often spoken of collectively in the singular under such a patronymic. Hence we read in Scripture, that Israel abode in tents; that Judah was put to the worst in battle; that Dan abode in ships; and Asher remained on the sea-coast. The same manner of speaking undoubtedly prevailed both in Egypt, and in other countries: and Chus must have been often put for the Cuthites, or Cuseans; Amon for the Amonians; and Asur, or the Assyrian, for the people of Assyria. Hence, when it was said, that the Ninevite performed any great action, it has been ascribed to a person Ninus, the supposed founder of Nineve. And as none of the Assyrian conquests were antecedent to Pul, and Assur Adon, writers have been guilty of an unpardonable anticipation, in ascribing those conquests to the first king of the country. A like anticipation, amounting to a great many centuries, is to be found in the annals of the Babylonians. Every thing that was done in later times, has been attributed to Belus, Semiramis, and other, imaginary princes, who are represented as the founders of the kingdom. We may, I think, be assured, that under the character of Ninus, and Ninyas, we are to understand the Ninevites; as by Semiramis is meant a people called Samarim: and the great actions of these two nations are in the histories of these personages recorded. But writers have rendered the account inconsistent by limiting, what was an historical series of many ages, to the life of a single person. The Ninevites and Samarim did perform all that is attributed to Semiramis, and Ninus. They did conquer the Medes, and Bactrians; and extended their dominions westward as far as Phrygia, and the river Tanais, and to the Southward as



far as Arabia, and Egypt. But these events were many ages after the foundation of the two kingdoms. They began under Pul of Nineve; and were carried on by Assur Adon, Salmanassur, Sennacherib, and other of his successors. Nineve was at last ruined, and the kingdom of Assyria was united with that of
[931]Babylonia. This is probably alluded to in the supposed marriage of Semiramis and Ninus. Then it was, that the Samarim performed the great works attributed to them. For, exclusive of what was
performed at Babylon; There are, says [932]Strabo, almost over the face of the whole earth, vast
[933]mounds of earth, and walls, and ramparts, attributed to Semiramis; and in these are subterraneous passages of communication, and tanks for water, with staircases of stone. There are also vast canals to divert the course of rivers, and lakes to receive them; together with highways and bridges of a
wonderful structure. They built the famous terraces at [934]Babylon; and those beautiful gardens at Egbatana, after that city had fallen into their hands. To them was owing that cruel device of emasculating their slaves, that their numerous wives, and concubines might be more securely guarded: an invention, which cannot consistently be attributed to a woman. They found out the art of weaving cotton: which discovery has by some been assigned to those of their family, who went into Egypt: for there were Samarim here too. In consequence of this, the invention has been attributed to a Semiramis,
who is here represented as a man, and a king of the country: at least it is referred to his reign. [935]Επι
τε Σεμιραμεως βασιλεως Αιγυπτιων τα βυσσινα ἱματια ἑυρησθαι ἱστορουσιν. The Samarim of Egypt and Babylonia, were of the same family, the sons of Chus. They came and settled among the Mizraim, under the name of the shepherds, of whose history I have often spoken. The reason of their being called Semarim, and Samarim, I shall hereafter disclose, together with the purport of the name, and the history, with which it is attended.
ZOROASTER.
The celebrated Zoroaster seems to have been a personage as much mistaken, as any, who have preceded. The antients, who treated of him, have described him in the same foreign light, as they have represented Perseus, Dionusus, and Osiris. They have formed a character, which by length of time has been separated, and estranged, from the person, to whom it originally belonged. And as among the antients, there was not a proper uniformity observed in the appropriation of terms, we shall find more persons than one spoken of under the character of Zoroaster: though there was one principal, to whom it more truly related. It will be found, that not only the person originally recorded, and reverenced; but others, by whom the rites were instituted and propagated, and by whom they were in aftertimes renewed, have been mentioned under this title: Priests being often denominated from the Deity, whom they served.
Of men, styled Zoroaster, the first was a deified personage, reverenced by some of his posterity, whose worship was styled Magia, and the professors of it Magi. His history is therefore to be looked for among the accounts transmitted by the antient Babylonians, and Chaldeans. They were the first people styled Magi; and the institutors of those rites, which related to Zoroaster. From them this worship was imparted to the Persians, who likewise had their Magi. And when the Babylonians sunk into a more complicated idolatry, the Persians, who succeeded to the sovereignty of Asia, renewed under their Princes, and particularly under Darius, the son of Hystaspes, these rites, which had been, in a great
degree, effaced, and forgotten. That king was devoted to the religion styled Magia[936]; and looked upon it as one of his most honourable titles, to be called a professor of those doctrines. The Persians were originally named Peresians, from the Deity Perez, or Parez the Sun; whom they also worshipped under
the title of [937]Zor-Aster. They were at different æras greatly distressed and persecuted, especially upon the death of their last king Yesdegerd. Upon this account they retired into Gedrosia and India; where people of the same family had for ages resided. They carried with them some shattered memorials of their religion in writing, from whence the Sadder, Shaster, Vedam, and Zandavasta were compiled. These memorials seem to have been taken from antient symbols ill understood; and all that remains of them consists of extravagant allegories and fables, of which but little now can be decyphered. Upon these traditions the religion of the Brahmins and Persees is founded.
The person who is supposed to have first formed a code of institutes for this people, is said to have been one of the Magi, named Zerdusht. I mention this, because Hyde, and other learned men, have imagined this Zerdusht to have been the antient Zoroaster. They have gone so far as to suppose the two names to
have been the [938]same; between which I can scarce descry any resemblance. There seem to have been many persons styled Zoroaster: so that if the name had casually retained any affinity, or if it had been literally the same, yet it would not follow, that this Persic and Indian Theologist was the person of whom antiquity speaks so loudly. We read of persons of this name in different parts of the world, who were all of them Magi, or Priests, and denominated from the rites of Zoroaster, which they followed. Suidas mentions a Zoroaster, whom he styles an Assyrian; and another whom he calls Περσο-Μηδης, Perso-Medes: and describes them both as great in science. There was a Zoroaster Proconnesius, in the
time of Xerxes, spoken of by [939]Pliny. Arnobius mentions Zoroastres Bactrianus: and Zoroastres
Zostriani nepos [940]Armenius. Clemens Alexandrinus takes notice of Zoroaster [941]Medus, who is probably the same as the Perso-Medes of Suidas. Zoroastres Armenius is likewise mentioned by him,



but is styled the son of [942]Armenius, and a Pamphylian. It is said of him that he had a renewal of life: and that during the term that he was in a state of death, he learned many things of the Gods. This was a piece of mythology, which I imagine did not relate to the Pamphylian Magus, but to the head of all the Magi, who was reverenced and worshipped by them. There was another styled a Persian, whom
Pythagoras is said to have [943]visited. Justin takes notice of the Bactrian [944]Zoroaster, whom he places
in the time of Ninus. He is also mentioned by [945]Cephalion, who speaks of his birth, and the birth of Semiramis (γενεσιν Σεμιραμεως και Ζωροαστρου Μαγου) as of the same date. The natives of
India have a notion of a Zoroaster, who was of Chinese original, as we are informed by [946]Hyde. This learned man supposes all these personages, the Mede, the Medo-Persic, the Proconnesian, the Bactrian, the Pamphylian, &c. to have been one and the same. This is very wonderful; as they are by their history apparently different. He moreover adds, that however people may differ about the origin of this person,
yet all are unanimous about the time when he [947]lived. To see that these could not all be the same person, we need only to cast our eye back upon the evidence which has been collected above: and it will be equally certain, that they could not be all of the same æra. There are many specified in history; but we may perceive, that there was one person more antient and celebrated than the rest; whose history has been confounded with that of others who came after him. This is a circumstance which has been
observed by [948]many: but this ingenious writer unfortunately opposes all who have written upon the
subject, however determinately they may have expressed themselves. [949]At quicquid dixerint, ille (Zoroaster) fuit tantum unus, isque tempore Darii Hystaspis: nec ejus nomine plures unquam extitere. It is to be observed, that the person, whom he styles Zoroaster, was one Zerdusht. He lived, it seems, in the reign of Darius, the father of Xerxes; which was about the time of the battle of Marathon: consequently not a century before the birth of Eudoxus, Xenophon, and Plato. We have therefore no
authority to suppose [950]this Zerdusht to have been the famous Zoroaster. He was apparently the renewer of the Sabian rites: and we may be assured, that he could not be the person so celebrated by the antients, who was referred to the first ages. Hyde asserts, that all writers agree about the time, when Zoroaster made his appearance: and he places him, as we have seen above, in the reign of Darius. But
Xanthus Lydius made him above [951]six hundred years prior. And [952]Suidas from some anonymous author places him five hundred years before the war of Troy. Hermodorus Platonicus went much farther,
and made him five thousand years before that [953]æra. Hermippus, who professedly wrote of his
doctrines, supposed him to have been of the same [954]antiquity. Plutarch also [955]concurs, and allows him five thousand years before that war. Eudoxus, who was a consummate philosopher, and a great
traveller, supposed him to have flourished six thousand years before the death of [956]Plato. Moses
[957]Chorenensis, and [958]Cephalion, make him only contemporary with Ninus, and Semiramis: but even this removes him very far from the reign of Darius. Pliny goes beyond them all; and places him
many thousand years before Moses. [959]Est et alia Magices factio, a Mose, et Jamne, et Lotapea Judæis pendens: sed multis millibus annorum post Zoroastrem. The numbers in all these authors, are extravagant: but so much we may learn from them, that they relate to a person of the highest antiquity. And the purport of the original writers, from whence the Grecians borrowed their evidence, was undoubtedly to shew, that the person spoken of lived at the extent of time; at the commencement of all historical data. No fact, no memorial upon record, is placed so high as they have carried this personage. Had Zoroaster been no earlier than Darius, Eudoxus would never have advanced him to this degree of antiquity. This writer was at the same distance from Darius, as Plato, of whom he speaks: and it is not to be believed, that he could be so ignorant, as not to distinguish between a century, and six thousand years. Agathias indeed mentions, that some of the Persians had a notion, that he flourished in the time of one Hystaspes; but he confesses, that who the Hystaspes was, and at what time he lived, was
[960]uncertain. Aristotle wrote not long after Eudoxus, when the history of the Persians was more known to the Grecians, and he allots the same number of years between Zoroaster and Plato, as had been
[961]before given. These accounts are for the most part carried too far; but at the same time, they fully ascertain the high antiquity of this person, whose æra is in question. It is plain that these writers in general extend the time of his life to the æra of the world, according to their estimation; and make it prior to Inachus, and Phoroneus, and Ægialeus of Sicyon.
Huetius takes notice of the various accounts in respect to his country. [962]Zoroastrem nunc Persam, nunc Medum ponit Clemens Alexandrinus; Persomedum Suidas; plerique Bactrianuni; alii Æthiopem, quos inter ait Arnobius ex Æthiopiâ interiore per igneam Zonam venisse Zoroastrem. In short, they have supposed a Zoroaster, wherever there was a Zoroastrian: that is, wherever the religion of the Magi was adopted, or revived. Many were called after him: but who among men was the Prototype can only be found out by diligently collating the histories, which have been transmitted. I mention among men; for the title originally belonged to the Sun; but was metaphorically bestowed upon sacred and enlightened personages. Some have thought that the person alluded to was Ham. He has by others been taken for
Chus, also for Mizraim, and [963]Nimrod: and by Huetius for Moses. It may be worth while to consider the primitive character, as given by different writers. He was esteemed the first observer of the heavens; and it is said that the antient Babylonians received their knowledge in Astronomy from him: which was



afterwards revived under Ostanes; and from them it was derived to the [964]Egyptians, and to the Greeks. Zoroaster was looked upon as the head of all those, who are supposed to have followed his
[965]institutes: consequently he must have been prior to the Magi, and Magia, the priests, and worship, which were derived from him. Of what antiquity they were, may be learned from Aristotle. [966]Αριστοτελης δ' εν πρωτῳ περι φιλοσοφιας (τους Μαγους) και πρεσβυτερους ειναι των Αιγυπτιων. The Magi, according to Aristotle, were prior even to the Egyptians: and with the antiquity
of the Egyptians, we are well acquainted. Plato styles him the son of [967]Oromazes, who was the chief
Deity of the Persians: and it is said of him, that he laughed upon the day on which he was [968]born. By this I imagine, that something fortunate was supposed to be portended: some indication, that the child would prove a blessing to the world. In his childhood he is said to have been under the care of
[969]Azonaces: which I should imagine was a name of the chief Deity Oromazes, his reputed father. He
was in process of time greatly enriched with knowledge, and became in high repute for his [970]piety,
and justice. He first sacrificed to the Gods, and taught men to do the [971]same. He likewise instructed
them in science, for which he was greatly [972]famed: and was the first who gave them laws. The Babylonians seem to have referred to him every thing, which by the Egyptians was attributed to Thoth
and Hermes. He had the title of [973]Zarades, which signifies the Lord of light, and is equivalent to
Orus, Oromanes, and Osiris, It was sometimes expressed [974]Zar-Atis, and supposed to belong to a
feminine Deity of the Persians. Moses Chorenensis styles him [975]Zarovanus, and speaks of him as the father of the Gods. Plutarch would insinuate, that he was author of the doctrine, embraced afterwards by
the Manicheans, concerning two prevailing principles, the one good, and the other evil[976]: the former
of these was named Oromazes, the latter Areimanius. But these notions were of late [977]date, in
comparison of the antiquity which is attributed to [978]Zoroaster. If we might credit what was delivered in the writings transmitted under his name, which were probably composed by some of the later Magi, they would afford us a much higher notion of his doctrines. Or if the account given by Ostanes were
genuine, it would prove, that there had been a true notion of the Deity transmitted from [979]Zoroaster, and kept up by the Magi, when the rest of the gentile world was in darkness. But this was by no means
true. It is said of Zoroaster, that he had a renewal of [980]life: for I apply to the original person of the name, what was attributed to the Magus of Pamphylia: and it is related of him, that while he was in the
intermediate state of death, he was instructed by the [981]Gods. Some speak of his retiring to a mountain
of Armenia, where he had an intercourse with the [982]Deity: and when the mountain burned with fire, he was preserved unhurt. The place to which he retired, according to the Persic writers, was in the
region called [983]Adarbain; where in aftertimes was the greatest Puratheion in Asia. This region was in Armenia: and some make him to have been born in the same country, upon one of the Gordiæan
[984]mountains. Here it was, that he first instituted sacrifices, and gave laws to his followers; which laws are supposed to be contained in the sacred book named Zandavasta. To him has been attributed the invention of Magic; which notion has arisen from a misapplication of terms. The Magi Were priests, and they called religion in general Magia. They, and their rites, grew into disrepute; in consequence of which they were by the Greeks called απατεωνες, φαρμακευται: jugglers, and conjurers. But the
Persians of old esteemed them very highly. [985]Μαγον, τον θεοσεβη, και θεολογον, και ἱερεα, ὁι
Περσαι ὁυτως λεγουσιν. By a Magus, the Persians understand a sacred person, a professor of
theology, and a Priest. Παρα Περσαις [986]Μαγοι ὁι φιλοσοφοι, και θεοφιλοι. Among the
Persians, the Magi are persons addicted to philosophy, and to the worship of the Deity. [987]Dion. Chrysostom, and Porphyry speak to the same purpose. By Zoroaster being the author of Magia, is meant, that he was the first promoter of religious rites, and the instructor of men in their duty to God. The war of Ninus with Zoroaster of Bactria relates probably to some hostilities carried on between the Ninevites of Assyria, and the Bactrians, who had embraced the Zoroastrian rites. Their priest, or prince,
for they were of old the same, was named [988]Oxuartes; but from his office had the title of Zoroaster; which was properly the name of the Sun, whom he adored. This religion began in Chaldea; and it is expressly said of this Bactrian king, that he borrowed the knowledge of it from that country, and added
to it largely. [989]Cujus scientiæ sæculis priscis multa ex Chaldæorum arcanis Bactrianus addidit Zoroastres. When the Persians gained the empire in Asia, they renewed these rites, and doctrines.
[990]Multa deinde (addidit) Hystaspes Rex prudentissimus, Darii pater. These rites were idolatrous; yet not so totally depraved, and gross, as those of other nations. They were introduced by Chus; at least by the Cuthites: one branch of whom were the Peresians, or Persians. The Cuthites of Chaldea were the original Magi, and they gave to Chus the title of Zoroaster Magus, as being the first of the order. Hence
the account given by Gregorius Turonensis is in a great degree true. [991]Primogeniti Cham filii Noë fuit Chus. Hic ad Persas transiit, quem Persæ vocitavere Zoroastrem. Chus, we find, was called by this title; and from him the religion styled Magia passed to the Persians. But titles, as I have shewn, were not always determinately appropriated: nor was Chus the original person, who was called Zoroaster. There was another beyond him, who was the first deified mortal, and the prototype in this worship. To whom I



allude, may, I think, be known from the history given above. It will not fail of being rendered very clear in the course of my procedure.
The purport of the term Zoroaster is said, by [992]the author of the Recognitions, and by others, to be the living star: and they speak of it as if it were of Grecian etymology, and from the words ζωον and
αστηρ. It is certainly compounded of Aster, which, among many nations, signified a star. But, in respect to the former term, as the object of the Persic and Chaldaic worship was the Sun, and most of their titles were derived from thence; we may be pretty certain, that by Zoro-Aster was meant Sol Asterius. Zor, Sor, Sur, Sehor, among the Amonians, always related to the Sun. Eusebius says, that
Osiris was esteemed the same as Dionusus, and the Sun: and that he was called [993]Surius. The region of Syria was hence denominated Συρια; and is at this day called Souria, from Sur, and Sehor, the Sun. The Dea Syria at Hierapolis was properly Dea Solaris. In consequence of the Sun's being called Sor, and
Sur, we find that his temple is often mentioned under the name of [994]Beth-Sur, and [995]Beth-Sura,
which Josephus renders [996]Βηθ-Σουρ. It was also called Beth-Sor, and Beth-Soron, as we learn from
[997]Eusebius, and [998]Jerome. That Suria was not merely a provincial title is plain, from the Suria Dea
being worshipped at Erix in [999]Sicily; and from an inscription to her at [1000]Rome. She was worshipped under the same title in Britain, as we may infer from an Inscription at Sir Robert Cotton's, of Connington, in Cambridgeshire.
[1001]DEÆ SURIÆ SUB CALPURNIO LEG. AUG. &c.
Syria is called Sour, and Souristan, at this day.



Pl. XI. Deus Azon Persicus.
The Grecians therefore were wrong in their etymology; and we may trace the origin of their mistake, when they supposed the meaning of Zoroaster to have been vivens astrum. I have mentioned, that both
Zon and [1002]Zoan signified the Sun: and the term Zor had the same meaning. In consequence of this, when the Grecians were told that Zor-Aster was the same as Zoan-Aster, they, by an uniform mode of mistake, expressed the latter ζωον; and interpreted Zoroaster αστερα ζωον. But Zoan signified the Sun. The city Zoan in Egypt was Heliopolis; and the land of Zoan the Heliopolitan nome. Both ZoanAster, and Zor-Aster, signified Sol Asterius. The God Menes was worshipped under the symbol of a bull; and oftentimes under the symbol of a bull and a man. Hence we read of Meno-Taur, and of Taur



Men, in Crete, Sicily, and other places. The same person was also styled simply [1003]Taurus, from the emblem under which he was represented. This Taurus was also called Aster, and Asterius, as we learn
from [1004]Lycophron, and his Scholiast. Ὁ Αστηριος ὁυτος εστιν ὁ και Μινοταυρος. By Asterius
is signified the same person as the Minotaur. This Taur-Aster is exactly analogous to [1005]Zor-Aster above. It was the same emblem as the Mneuis, or sacred bull of Egypt; which was described with a star
between his horns. Upon some of the [1006]entablatures at Naki Rustan, supposed to have been the
antient Persepolis, we find the Sun to be described under the appearance of a bright [1007]star: and nothing can better explain the history there represented, than the account given of Zoroaster. He was the reputed son of Oromazes, the chief Deity; and his principal instructor was Azonaces, the same person under a different title. He is spoken of as one greatly beloved by heaven: and it is mentioned of him, that he longed very much to see the Deity, which at his importunity was granted to him. This interview,
however, was not effected by his own corporeal eyes, but by the mediation of an [1008]angel. Through this medium the vision was performed: and he obtained a view of the Deity surrounded with light. The angel, through whose intervention this favour was imparted, seems to have been one of those styled
Zoni, and [1009]Azoni. All the vestments of the priests, and those in which they used to apparel their Deities, had sacred names, taken from terms in their worship. Such were Camise, Candys, Camia, Cidaris, Mitra, Zona, and the like. The last was a sacred fillet, or girdle, which they esteemed an emblem of the orbit described by Zon, the Sun. They either represented their Gods as girded round with a serpent, which was an emblem of the same meaning; or else with this bandage, denominated
[1010]Zona. They seem to have been secondary Deities, who were called Zoni and [1011]Azoni. The term signifies Heliadæ: and they were looked upon as æthereal essences, a kind of emanation from the Sun. They were exhibited under different representations; and oftentimes like Cneph of Egypt. The fillet, with which the Azoni were girded, is described as of a fiery nature: and they were supposed to have
been wafted through the air. Arnobius speaks of it in this light. [1012]Age, nunc, veniat, quæso, per igneam zonam Magus ab interiore orbe Zoroastres. I imagine, that by Azonaces, Αζωνακης, beforementioned, the reputed teacher of Zoroaster, was meant the chief Deity, the same as Oromanes, and Oromasdes. He seems to have been the supreme of those æthereal spirits described above; and to
have been named Azon-Nakis, which signifies the great Lord, [1013]Azon. Naki, Nakis, Nachis, Nachus, Negus, all in different parts of the world betoken a king. The temple at Istachar, near which these representations were found, is at this day called the palace of Naki Rustan, whoever that personage may have been.

Zor-Aster, sive Taurus Solaris Ægyptiacus
ORPHEUS.
The character of Orpheus is in some respects not unlike that of Zoroaster, as will appear in the sequel. He went over many regions of the earth; and in all places, whither he came, was esteemed both as a priest, and a prophet. There seems to be more in his history than at first sight appears: all which will by degrees be unfolded. His skill in harmony is represented as very wonderful: insomuch that he is said to have tamed the wild beasts of the forest, and made the trees follow him. He likewise could calm the winds, and appease the raging of the sea. These last circumstances are taken notice of by a poet in some fine verses, wherein he laments his death.
[1014]Ὁυκ ετι κοιμασεις ανεμων βρομον, ουχι χαλαζαν, Ου νιφετων συρμους, ου παταγευσαν ἁλα. Ωλεο γαρ. κλ.
He is mentioned, as having been twice in a state of [1015]death; which is represented as a twofold descent to the shades below. There is also an obscure piece of mythology about his wife, and a serpent; also of the Rhoia or Pomegranate: which seems to have been taken from some symbolical representation at a time, when the purport was no longer understood. The Orpheans dealt particularly in symbols, as we learn from Proclus. [1016]Ορφικοι δια συμβολον, Πυθαγορειοι δια εικονων, τα θεια μηνυειν εφιεμενοι. His character for science was very great; and Euripides takes particular notice of some antient tablets, containing much salutary knowledge, which were bequeathed to the Thracians by Orpheus: [1017]ἁς Ορφειη κατεγραψε γηρυς. Plato styles his works [1018]βιβλων ὁμαδον, a vast lumber of learning, from the quantity, which people pretended had been transmitted from him. He one while resided in Greece; and particularly at Thebes in Bœotia. Here he introduced the rites of Dionusus,
and celebrated his Orgies upon mount [1019]Cithæron. He is said to have been the first who instituted
those rites: and was the author of all mysterious worship. [1020]Πρωτος Ορφευς μυστηρια Θεων
παρεδωκεν. All these were accompanied with science of another nature: for he is reputed to have been skilled in many arts.
From Thebes he travelled towards the sea-coast of Chaonia, in order to recover his lost Eurydice; who
had been killed by a serpent. According to [1021]Agatharchides Cnidius it was at Aorthon in Epirus, that
he descended for this purpose to the shades below. The same account is given by [1022]Pausanias, who calls the place more truly Aornon. In the Orphic Argonauts it is said to have been performed at Tænarus
in [1023]Laconia. He likewise resided in Egypt, and travelled over the regions of Libya; and every where instructed people in the rites, and religion, which he professed. In the same manner he went over a great part of the world.



[1024]Ως ἱκομην επι γαιαν απειρετον, ηδε ποληας, Αιγυπτῳ, Λιβυῃ τε, βροτοις ανα θεσφατα φαινων.
Some make Orpheus by birth a Thracian; some an Arcadian: others a Theban. Pausanias mentions it as
an opinion among the [1025]Egyptians, that both Orpheus, and Amphion, were from their country. There is great uncertainty about his parents. He is generally supposed to have been the son of Œagrus, and
Calliope: but Asclepiades made him the son of Apollo, by that [1026]Goddess. By some his mother was
said to have been Menippe; by others [1027]Polymnia. He is also mentioned as the son of
[1028]Thamyras. Plato differs from them all, and styles both Orpheus, and Musæus, [1029]Σεληνης και
Μουσων εγγονοι, the offspring of the Moon, and the Muses: in which account is contained some curious mythology. The principal place of his residence is thought to have been in Pieria near mount Hæmus. He is also said to have resided among the Edonians; and in Sithonia, at the foot of mount Pangæus; also upon the sea-coast at Zona. In all these places he displayed his superiority in science; for he was not only a Poet, and skilled in harmony, but a great Theologist and Prophet; also very knowing
in medicine, and in the history of the [1030]heavens. According to Antipater Sidonius, he was the author of Heroic verse. And some go so far as to ascribe to him the invention of letters; and deduce all
knowledge from [1031]him.
Many of the things, reported to have been done by Orpheus, are attributed to other persons, such as
[1032]Eetion, Musæus, Melampus, Linus, Cadmus, and Philammon. Some of these are said to have had
the same [1033]parents. Authors in their accounts of Orpheus, do not agree about the manner of his
[1034]death. The common notion is, that he was torn to pieces by the Thracian women. But, according to
Leonides, in Laërtius, he was slain by lightning: and there is an [1035]epitaph to that purpose. The name of Orpheus is to be found in the lists of the Argonauts: and he is mentioned in the two principal poems upon that subject. Yet there were writers who placed him eleven generations before the war of Troy,
consequently ten generations before that expedition. [1036]Γεγονε προ ια γενεων των Τρωικων
βιωναι δε γενεας θ· ὁι δε ια φησιν. He was born eleven ages before the siege of Troy, and he is said
to have lived nine ages; and according to some eleven. This extent of [1037]life has been given him in order to bring him down as low as the aera of the Argonauts: though, if we may believe Pherecydes Syrus, he had no share in that expedition.
To remedy the inconsistences, which arise in the history of Orpheus, writers have supposed many
persons of this name. Suidas takes notice of no less than four in [1038]Thrace. But all these will not make the history consistent. Vossius therefore, with good reason, doubts whether such a person ever existed.
Nay, he asserts, [1039]Triumviros istos Poeseos, Orphea, Musæum, Linum, non fuisse: sed esse nomina ab antiquâ Phœnicum linguâ, quâ usi Cadmus, et aliquamdiu posteri. There is great truth in what Vossius here advances: and in respect to Orpheus, the testimony of Aristotle, quoted by him from
Cicero, is very decisive. [1040]Orpheum poetam docet Aristoteles nunquam fuisse. Dionysius, as we learn from Suidas, affirmed the same thing. Palæphatus indeed admits the man; but sets aside the
history. [1041]Ψευδης και ὁ περι του Θρφεως μυθος. The history too of Orpheus is nothing else but a fable. From what has been said, I think it is plain, that under the character of this personage we are to
understand a people named [1042]Orpheans; who, as Vossius rightly intimates, were the same as the Cadmians. In consequence of this, there will sometimes be found a great similarity between the characters of these two persons.
I have shewn, that Colonies from [1043]Egypt settled in the region of Sethon, called afterwards Sethonia, upon the river Palæstinus. They were likewise to be found in the countries of Edonia, Pieria, and Peonia: in one of which they founded a city and temple. The Grecians called this city Orpheus:
[1044]Ορφευς εστι πολις υπο τῃ Πιεριῃ. Orpheus is a city of Thrace, below Pieria. But the place was originally expressed Orphi, by which is meant the oracular temple of Orus. From hence, and from the worship here instituted, the people were styled Orphites, and Orpheans. They were noted for the Cabiritic mysteries; and for the Dionusiaca, and worship of Damater. They were likewise very famous for the medicinal arts; and for their skill in astronomy and music. But the Grecians have comprehended, under the character of one person, the history of a people. When they settled in Thrace, they introduced
their arts, and their worship, among the barbarous [1045]natives, by whom they were revered for their superior knowledge. They likewise bequeathed many memorials of themselves, and of their forefathers, which were probably some emblematical sculptures upon wood or stone: hence we read of the tablets of
Orpheus preserved in Thrace, and particularly upon mount [1046]Hæmus. The temple which they built upon this mountain seems to have been a college, and to have consisted of a society of priests. They were much addicted to celibacy, as we may judge from their history; and were, in great measure, recluses after the mode of Egypt and Canaan. Hence it is said of Orpheus, that he secreted himself from
the world, and led the life of a [1047]Swan: and it is moreover mentioned of Aristæus, when he made a



visit to Dionusus upon mount Hæmus, that he disappeared from the sight of men, and was never after
[1048]seen. According to the most common accounts concerning the death of Orpheus, it was owing to his principles, and manner of life. He was a solitary, and refused all commerce with womankind: hence the Mænades, and other women of Thrace, rose upon him, and tore him to pieces. It is said, that his head, and lyre were thrown into the Hebrus; down which they were wafted to Lemnos. What is here mentioned of Orpheus, undoubtedly relates to the Orpheans, and to their temple upon mount Hæmus. This temple was in process of time ruined: and there is great reason to think, that it was demolished upon account of the cruelties practised by the priests, and probably from a detestation of their unnatural crimes, to which there are frequent allusions. Ovid having given a character of Orpheus, concludes with an accusation to this purpose.
[1049]Ille etiam Thracum populis fuit auctor amores In teneros transferre mares: citraque juventam Ætatis breve ver, et primos carpere flores.
Those of the community, who survived the disaster, fled down the Hebrus to Lesbos; where they either found, or erected, a temple similar to that which they had quitted. Here the same worship was instituted; and the place grew into great reputation. They likewise settled at Lenmos. This island lay at no great distance from the former; and was particularly devoted to the Deity of fire. It is said by Hecatæus, that it received the name of Lemnos from the Magna Dea, Cybele. She was styled by the natives Λημνος, and
at her shrine they used to sacrifice young persons. [1050]Απο μεγαλης λεγομενης Θεου· ταυτῃ δε
και παρθενους εθυον. They seem to have named the temple at Lesbos Orphi, and Orpheï caput: and it appears to have been very famous on account of its oracle. Philostratus says, that the Ionians, and Æolians, of old universally consulted it: and, what is extraordinary, that it was held in high estimation
by the people of [1051]Babylonia. He calls the place the head of Orpheus: and mentions, that the oracle proceeded from a cavity in the earth; and that it was consulted by Cyrus, the Persian. That the Babylonians had a great veneration for a temple named Orphi, I make no doubt: but it certainly could not be the temple at Lesbos. During the Babylonish empire, Greece, and its islands, were scarcely known to people of that country. And when the Persians succeeded, it is not credible, that they should apply to an oracle at Lesbos, or to an oracle of Greece. They were too refined in their religious notions to make any such application. It is notorious, that, when Cambyses, and Ochus, invaded Egypt, and when Xerxes made his inroad into Greece, they burnt and ruined the temples in each nation, out of abomination to the worship. It was another place of this name, an oracle of their own, to which the Babylonians, and Persians, applied. For it cannot be supposed, in the times spoken of, that they had a correspondence with the western world. It was Ur, in Chaldea, the seat of the antient Magi, which was styled Urphi, and Orphi, on account of its being the seat of an oracle. That there was such a temple is plain from Stephanus Byzantinus, who tells us, [1052]Μαντειον εχειν αυτους (Χαλδαιους) παρα
βαρβαροις, ὡς Δελφοι παρ' Ἑλλησι. The Chaldeans had an oracle as famous among the people of those parts, as Delphi was among the Grecians. This temple was undoubtedly styled Urphi. I do not mean, that this was necessarily a proper name; but an appellative, by which oracular places were in general distinguished. The city Edessa in Mesopotamia seems likewise to have had the name of Urphi, which was given on account of the like rites, and worship. That it was so named, we may fairly presume
from its being by the natives called [1053]Urpha, at this day. It was the former temple, to which the Babylonians, and Persians had recourse: and it was from the Magi of these parts, that the Orphic rites and mysteries were originally derived. They came from Babylonia to Egypt, and from thence to Greece.
We accordingly find this particular in the character of Orpheus, [1054]ειναι δε τον Ορφεα μαγευσαι
δεινον, that he was great in all the mysteries of the Magi. We moreover learn from Stephanus Monachius, that Orphon, a term of the same purport as Orpheus, was one of the appellations, by which
the Magi were called. [1055]Orphon, quod Arabibus Magum sonat. In short, under the character of Orpheus, we have the history both of the Deity, and of his votaries. The head of Orpheus was said to have been carried to Lemnos, just as the head of Osiris used to be wafted to Byblus. He is described as going to the shades below, and afterwards returning to upper air. This is similar to the history of Osiris, who was supposed to have been in a state of death, and after a time to have come to life. There was moreover something mysterious in the death of Orpheus; for it seems to have been celebrated with the same frantic acts of grief, as people practised in their lamentations for Thamuz and Osiris, and at the rites of Baal. The Bistonian women, who were the same as the Thyades, and Mænades, used to gash
their arms with knives, and besmear themselves with [1056]blood, and cover their heads with ashes. By this display of sorrow we are to understand a religious rite; for Orpheus was a title, under which the Deity of the place was worshipped. He was the same as Orus of Egypt, whom the Greeks esteemed both as Apollo, and Hephaistus. That he was a deity is plain from his temple and oracle abovementioned: which, we find, were of great repute, and resorted to by various people from the opposite coast.
As there was an Orpheus in Thrace, so there appears to have been an Orpha in [1057]Laconia, of whose history we have but few remains. They represent her as a Nymph, the daughter of Dion, and greatly beloved by Dionusus. She was said, at the close of her life, to have been changed to a tree. The fable



probably relates to the Dionusiaca, and other Orphic rites, which had been in early times introduced into the part of the world abovementioned, where they were celebrated at a place called Orpha. But the rites grew into disuse, and the history of the place became obsolete: hence Orpha has been converted to a nymph, favoured of the God there worshipped; and was afterwards supposed to have been changed to one of the trees, which grew within its precincts.
Many undertook to write the history of Orpheus; the principal of whom were Zopurus of Heraclea, Prodicus Chius, Epigenes, and Herodorus. They seem all to have run into that general mistake of forming a new personage from a title, and making the Deity a native, where he was inshrined. The writings, which were transmitted under the name of Orpheus, were innumerable: and are justly ridiculed by Lucian, both for their quantity, and matter. There were however some curious hymns, which used to be of old sung in Pieria, and Samothracia; and which Onomacritus copied. They contain indeed little more than a list of titles, by which the Deity in different places was addressed. But these titles are of great antiquity: and though the hymns are transmitted in a modern garb, the person, through whom we
receive them, being as late as [1058]Pisistratus, yet they deserve our notice. They must necessarily be of consequence, as they refer to the worship of the first ages, and afford us a great insight into the Theology of the antients. Those specimens also, which have been preserved by Proclus, in his dissertations upon Plato, afford matter of great curiosity. They are all imitations, rather than translations of the antient Orphic poetry, accompanied with a short comment. This poetry was in the original Amonian language, which grew obsolete among the Helladians, and was no longer intelligible: but was
for a long time preserved in [1059]Samothracia, and used in their sacred rites.
CADMUS.
Although I have said so much about Dionusus, Sesostris, and other great travellers, I cannot quit the subject till I have taken notice of Cadmus: for his expeditions, though not so extensive as some, which I have been mentioning, are yet esteemed of great consequence in the histories of antient nations. The time of his arrival in Greece is looked up to as a fixed æra: and many circumstances in chronology are thereby determined. He is commonly reputed to have been a Phenician by birth; the son of Agenor, who was the king of that country. He was sent by his father's order in quest of his sister Europa; and after wandering about a long time to little purpose, he at last settled in Greece. In this country were many traditions concerning him; especially in Attica, and Bœotia. The particular spot, where he is supposed to have taken up his residence, was in the latter province at Tanagra upon the river Ismenus. He afterwards built Thebes: and wherever he came, he introduced the religion of his country. This consisted in the
worship of [1060]Dionusus; and in the rites, which by the later Greeks were termed the Dionusiaca. They seem to have been much the same as the Cabyritic mysteries, which he is said to have established in Samothracia. He fought with a mighty dragon; whose teeth he afterwards sowed, and produced an army
of men. To him Greece is supposed to have been indebted for the first introduction of [1061]letters; which are said to have been the letters of his country Phenicia, and in number sixteen. He married Harmonia, the daughter of Mars and Venus: and his nuptials were graced with the presence of all the Gods, and Goddesses; each of whom conferred some gift upon the bride. He had several children; among whom was a daughter Semele, esteemed the mother of Bacchus. After having experienced great vicissitudes in life, he is said to have retired with his wife Harmonia to the coast of Illyria, where they were both changed to serpents. He was succeeded at Thebes by his son Polydorus, the father of Labdacus, the father of Laius. This last was the husband of Jocasta, by whom he had Œdipus.
Bochart with wonderful ingenuity, and equal learning, tries to solve the ænigmas, under which this history is represented. He supposes Cadmus to have been a fugitive Canaanite, who fled from the face of Joshua: and that he was called Cadmus from being a Cadmonite, which is a family mentioned by Moses. In like manner he imagines, that Harmonia had her name from mount Hermon, which was probably in the district of the Cadmonites. The story of the dragon he deduces from the Hevæi, or Hivites; the same people as the Cadmonites. He proceeds afterwards with great address to explain the rest of the fable, concerning the teeth of the dragon, which were sown; and the armed men, which from thence arose: and what he says is in many particulars attended with a great shew of probability. Yet after all his ingenious conjectures, I am obliged to dissent from him in some points; and particularly in one, which is of the greatest moment. I cannot be induced to think, that Cadmus was, as Bochart represents him, a Phenician. Indeed I am persuaded, that no such person existed. If Cadmus brought letters from Phenicia, how came he to bring but sixteen; when the people, from whom he imported them, had undoubtedly more, as we may infer from their neighbours? And if they were the current letters of Greece, as Herodotus intimates; how came it to pass, that the tablet of Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, the third in descent from Cadmus, could not be understood, as we are assured by
[1062]Plutarch? He says, that in the reign of Agesilaus of Sparta, a written tablet was found in the tomb of Alcmena, to whom it was inscribed: that the characters were obsolete, and unintelligible; on which account they sent it to Conuphis of Memphis in Egypt, to be decyphered. If these characters were Phenician, why were they sent to a priest of a different country for interpretation? and why is their date
and antiquity defined by the reign of a king in Egypt? [1063]Τους τυπους ειναι της επι Πρωτει



βασιλευοντι γραμματικης. The form of the letters was the same as was in use when Proteus reigned in that country. Herodotus, indeed, to prove that the Cadmians brought letters into Greece, assures us,
that he saw specimens of their writing at Thebes, in the temple of Apollo [1064]Ismenius: that there was a tripod as antient as the reign of Laius, the son of Labdacus; with an inscription, which imported, that it had been there dedicated by Amphitryon upon his victory over the Teleboæ. I make no doubt, but that Herodotus saw tripods with antient inscriptions: and there might be one with the name of Amphitryon: but how could he be sure that it was the writing of that person, and of those times? We know what a pleasure there is in enhancing the antiquity of things; and how often inscriptions are forged for that purpose. Is it credible that the characters of Amphitryon should be so easy to be apprehended, when those of his wife Alcmena could not be understood? and which of the two are we in this case to believe, Herodotus or Plutarch? I do not mean that I give any credence to the story of Alcmena and her tablet: nor do I believe that there was a tripod with characters as antient as Amphitryon. I only argue from the principles of the Greeks to prove their inconsistency. The Pheneatæ in Arcadia shewed to Pausanias an
inscription upon the basis of a brazen statue, which was dedicated to [1065]Poseidon Hippius. It was said to have been written by Ulysses, and contained a treaty made between him and some shepherds. But Pausanias acknowledges that it was an imposition; for neither statues of brass, nor statues of any sort, were in use at the time alluded to.
It is said of Cadmus, that he introduced the rites of [1066]Bacchus into Greece. But how is this possible, if Bacchus was his descendant, the son of his daughter Semele? To remedy this, the latter mythologists suppose, that there was a prior Bacchus, who was worshipped by Cadmus. This is their usual recourse, when they are hard pressed with inconsistencies. They then create other personages, to help them out of their difficulties. They form, with great facility, a new Semiramis, or Ninus; another Belus, Perseus, Minos, Hermes, Phoroneus, Apis, though to little purpose: for the mistake being fundamental, the inconveniencies cannot be remedied by such substitutes. We are told that Cadmus was a Phenician: but Diodorus Siculus speaks of him as assuredly of Egypt; and mentions moreover, that he was a native of
the Thebaïs: [1067]Καδμον εκ Θηβων οντα των Αιγυπτιων. Pherecydes Syrus also, from whom
most of the mythology of Greece was borrowed, makes Cadmus an [1068]Egyptian, the son of Agenor and Argiope, who was the daughter of Nilus. By others he is said to have been the son of Antiope, the daughter of Belus: consequently he must originally have been of Babylonish extraction. His father Agenor, from whom he is supposed to have been instructed in the sciences, is represented by Nonnus as residing at Thebes.
[1069]Πατρια θεσπεσιης δεδαημενος οργια τεχνης, Αιγυπτιης σοφιης μεταναστιος, ημος Αγηνωρ Μεμφιδος ενναετης ἑκατομπυλον ῳκεε Θηβην.
We learn the same from the Scholiast upon Lycophron, who styles the king Ogugus. [1070]Και ὁ Ωγυγος Θηβων Αιγυπτιων ην Βασιλευς, ὁθεν ὁ Καδμος ὑπαρχων, ελθων εν Ἑλλαδι τας Ἑπταπυλους εκτισε. Moreover Ogugus was king of Thebes in Egypt: of which country was Cadmus, who came into Greece, and built the city styled Heptapulæ. It was from the same part of the world, that the mysteries were imported, in which Cadmus is represented as so knowing: and here it was, that he was taught hieroglyphics, and the other characters, which are attributed to him. For he is said to have
been expert [1071]Χειρος οπισθοποροιο χαραγματα λοξα χαρασσων. These arts he carried first to the coast of Sidon, and Syria; and from thence he is supposed to have brought them to Greece: for, before he came to Hellas, he is said to have reigned in conjunction with Phœnix, both at Sidon and Tyre. [1072]Φοινιξ και Καδμος, απο Θηβων των Αιγυπτιων εξελθοντες εις την Συριαν Τυρου και Σιδωνος εβασιλευσαν. Phœnix and Cadmus came from Thebes in Egypt, and reigned at Tyre and Sidon.
Thus I have taken pains to shew, that Cadmus was not, as has been generally thought, a Phenician. My next endeavour will be to prove that no such person existed. If we consider the whole history of this celebrated hero, we shall find, that it was impossible for one person to have effected what he is supposed to have performed. His expeditions were various and wonderful; and such as in those early times would not have been attempted, nor could ever have been completed. The Helladians say little more, than that he built Thebes, and brought letters into Greece: that he slew a dragon, from the teeth of which being sowed in the ground there arose an army of earthborn men. The writers of other countries afford us a more extensive account: among the principal of which are to be esteemed Herodotus,
Diodorus, Strabo, and Pausanias. Some of them had their [1073]doubts about the reality of this adventurer: and from the history which they have transmitted, we may safely infer, that no such person existed, as has been described under the character of Cadmus.
He is said to have sailed first to [1074]Phenicia and Cyprus; and afterwards to [1075]Rhodes. Here he instructed the people in the religion which he professed; and founded a temple at Lindus, where he



appointed an order of priests. He did the same [1076]at Thera, and afterwards was at [1077]Thasus: and
proceeding in his travels partook of the Cabiritic mysteries in [1078]Samothracia. He visited [1079]Ionia,
and all the coast upwards to the Hellespont and Propontis. He was at Lesbos, which he named [1080]Issa: where some of his posterity were to be found long after. He was also at Anaphe, one of the Sporades;
which island was denominated Membliaros from one of his [1081]followers. Mention is made of his
being upon the [1082]Hellespont, and in Thrace. Here he resided, and found out a mine of [1083]gold,
having before found one of copper in [1084]Cyprus. Hence he is said to have procured great wealth. [1085]Ὁδε Καδμου πλουτος περι Θρακην, και το Παγγαιον ορος. We hear of him afterwards in
[1086]Eubœa; where there are to be found innumerable traces of him, and his followers. He was likewise
at [1087]Sparta, as we may infer from the Heroüm erected to him by Eurotas, and his brethren, the sons
of Huræus. He must have resided a great while in [1088]Attica; for there were many edifices about Athens attributed to him. He settled at Tanagra in Bœotia; where he lost all his companions, who were slain by a dragon. He afterwards built Thebes. Here he was king; and is said to have reigned sixty-two
[1089]years. But as if his wanderings were never to be terminated, he leaves his newly founded city, and
goes to Illyria. Here we find him again in regal state. [1090]Βασιλευει Καδμος των Ιλλυριων. He
reigns over the country which receives its name from his son. [1091]Ιλλυρια—απο Ιλλυριου του
Καδμονος παιδος. Now whoever is truly acquainted with antiquity, must know, that, in the times here spoken of, little correspondence was maintained between nation and nation. Depredations were very
frequent; and every little maritime power was in a state of [1092]piracy: so that navigation was attended with great peril. It is not therefore to be believed, that a person should so often rove upon the seas amid such variety of nations, and reside among them at his pleasure: much less that he should build temples, found cities, and introduce his religion, wherever he listed; and this too in such transient visits. Besides, according to the Egyptian accounts, the chief of his adventures were in Libya. He married Harmonia at
the lake [1093]Tritonis; and is said to have founded in that part of the world no less. than an hundred cities:
[1094]Λιβυστιδι Καδμος αρουρᾳ Δωμησας πολιων ἑκατονταδα.
Some of these cities seem to have been situated far west in the remoter parts of Africa.
[1095]Και Λιβυες στρατοωντο παρ' Ἑσπεριον κλιμα γαιης, Αγχινεφη ναιοντες Αλημονος αστεα Καδμου.
Carthage itself was of old called [1096]Cadmeia: so that he may be ranked among the founders of that city. Καρχηδων, Μητροπολις Λιβυης—εκαλειτο δε Καινη πολις, και Καδμεια. He is
mentioned by Moses Chorenensis to have settled in [1097]Armenia, where there was a regio Cadmeia not far from Colchis. He reigned here; and is said to have been of the giant race, and to have come from
[1098]Babylonia. And as the city Carthage in Libya was called Cadmeia, so in this region Cadmeia, there was a city Carthage: [1099]Καρχηδων πολις Αρμενιας.
Such are the expeditions of Cadmus. But is it credible that any person could have penetrated into the various regions, whither he is supposed to have gone? to have founded colonies in Phenicia, Cyprus, Rhodes, Thera, Thasus, Anaphe, Samothracia? to have twice visited the Hellespont? to have worked the mines in the Pangean mountains, and in other places? to have made settlements in Eubœa, Attica, Bœotia, and Illyria? and, above all, to have had such territories in Afric? He is represented as heir to the kingdom of Egypt: this he quitted, and obtained a kingdom in Phenicia. He leaves this too; and after much wandering arrives in Greece; where he founds several cities, and reigns sixty-two years. After this, hard to conceive! he is made king in Illyria. He must also have reigned in Afric: and his dominions seem to have been considerable, as he founded an hundred cities. He is represented as a king in Armenia; and had there too no small territory. Sure kingdoms in those times must have been very cheap,
if they were so easily attainable. But the whole is certainly a mistake; at least in respect to [1100]Cadmus. No person could possibly have effected what is attributed to him. They were not the achievements of one person, nor of one age. And place Cadmus at any given æra, and arrange his history, as may appear most plausible; yet there will arise numberless inconsistencies from the connexions he must have in respect to time, place, and people; such as no art nor disposition can remedy.
It may be asked, if there were no such man as Cadmus, what did the antients allude to under this character? and what is the true purport of these histories? The travels of Cadmus, like the expeditions of Perseus, Sesostris, and Osiris, relate to colonies, which at different times went abroad, and were distinguished by this title. But what was the work of many, and performed at various seasons, has been attributed to one person. Cadmus was one of the names of Osiris, the chief Deity of Egypt. Both Europa,



and Harmonia are of the like nature. They were titles of the Deity: but assumed by colonies, who went out, and settled under these denominations. The native Egyptians seldom left their country, but by force.
This necessity however did occur: for Egypt at times underwent great [1101]revolutions. It was likewise in some parts inhabited by people of a different cast; particularly by the sons of Chus. These were obliged to retire: in consequence of which they spread themselves over various parts of the earth. All, who embarked under the same name, or title, were in aftertimes supposed to have been under the same leader: and to him was attributed the honour of every thing performed. And as colonies of the same denomination went to parts of the world widely distant; their ideal chieftain, whether Cadmus, or Bacchus, or Hercules, was supposed to have traversed the same ground: and the achievements of different ages were conferred upon a fancied hero of a day. This has been the cause of great inconsistency throughout the mythology of the antients. To this they added largely, by being so lavish of titles, out of reverence to their gods. Wherever they came they built temples to them, and cities, under various denominations; all which were taken from some supposed attribute. These titles and attributes,
though they belonged originally to one God, the Sun; yet being [1102]manifold, and misapplied, gave rise to a multitude of Deities, whose æra never could be settled, nor their history rendered consistent. Cadmus was one of these. He was the same as Hermes of Egypt, called also Thoth, Athoth, and Canathoth: and was supposed to have been the inventor of letters. He was sometimes styled Cadmilus, another name for Hermes; under which he was worshipped in Samothracia, and Hetruria. Lycophron speaking of the prophet Prulis, in Lesbos, tells us, that he was the son of Cadmus, and of the race of Atlas. And he was the person, who was supposed to give information to the Greeks, when they were upon their expedition towards Troy.
[1103]Ὡς μη σε Καδμος ωφελ' εν περιῤῥυτῳ Ισσῃ φυτευσαι δυσμενων ποδηγετην.
These are the words of Cassandra: upon which the Scholiast observes; Πρυλις, ὑιος του Καδμιλου,
και Καδμου, ητοι Ἑρμου: Prulis of Lesbos was the son of Cadmilus, or Cadmus, the same as
Hermes. And afterwards he mentions, [1104]ὁ Καδμος, ητοι Ἑρμης, Cadmus, who is the same as Hermes. In another place he takes notice, that the name of Hermes among the Hetrurians was
[1105]Cadmilus: and it has been shewn, that Cadmilus, and Cadmus, are the same. To close the whole, we have this further evidence from Phavorinus, that Cadmus was certainly an epithet or title of Hermes. [1106]Καδμος, ου κυριον μονον, αλλα και Ἑρμου επιθετον.
Harmonia, the wife of Cadmus, who has been esteemed a mere woman, seems to have been an emblem
of nature, and the fostering nurse of all things. She is from hence styled [1107]παντροφος Ἁρμονια.
And when Venus is represented in the allegory as making her a visit, she is said to go [1108]εις δομον
Ἁρμονιας παμμητορος, to the house of the all-productive parent. In some of the Orphic verses she is represented not only as a Deity, but as the light of the world.
[1109]Ἁρμονιη, κοσμοιο φαεσφορε, και σοφε Δαιμον.
Harmonia was supposed to have been a personage, from whom all knowledge was derived. On this
account the books of science were styled [1110]κυρβιας Ἁρμονιας, the books of Harmonia, as well as the books of Hermes. These were four in number, of which Nonnus gives a curious account, and says, that they contained matter of wonderful antiquity.
[1111]Ειν ἑνι θεσφατα παντα, ταπερ πεπρωμενα κοσμῳ Πρωτογονοιο Φανητος επιγραφε μαντιπολος χειρ.
The first of them is said to have been coeval with the world.
[1112]Πρωτην κυρβιν οπωπεν ατερμονος ἡλικα κοσμου, Ειν ἑνι παντα φερουσαν, ὁσα σκηπτουχος Οφιων Ηνυσεν.
From hence we find, that Hermon, or Harmonia, was a Deity, to whom the first writing is ascribed. The same is said of Hermes. [1113]Ἑρμης λεγεται Θεων εν Αιγυπτῳ γραμματα πρωτος ἑυρειν. The invention is also attributed to Taut, or Thoth. [1114]Πρωτος εστι Τααυτος, ὁ των γραμματων την ἑυρεσιν επινοησας,—ὁν Αιγυπτιοι μεν εκαλεσαν Θωυθ, Αλεξανδρεις δε Θωθ, Ἑρμην δε Ἑλληνες μετεφρασαν. Cadmus is said not only to have brought letters into Greece, but to have been the inventor of them: from whence we may fairly conclude, that under the characters of Hermon, Hermes, Taut, Thoth, and Cadmus, one person is alluded to. The Deity called by the Greeks Harmonia,



was introduced among the Canaanites very early by people from Egypt: and was worshipped in Sidon,
and the adjacent country, by the name of [1115]Baal Hermon.
Europa likewise was a Deity; according to Lucian the same as Astarte, who was worshipped at
Hierapolis in Syria. He visited the temple, and had this information from the priests: [1116]ὡς δε μοι τις
των Ἱρεων απηγετο, Ευρωπης εστι (το αγαλμα) της Καδμου αδελφεης. He is speaking of the statue in the temple, which the priests told him belonged to a Goddess, the same as Europa, the sister of Cadmus. She was also esteemed the same as Rhea; which Rhea we know was the reputed mother of the gods, and particularly the mother of Jupiter.
[1117]Εστ' αν Ῥεια τεκοι παιδα Κρονῳ εν φιλοτητι.
Pindar speaks of Europa, as the [1118]daughter of Tityus: and by Herodotus she is made the mother of
[1119]Sarpedon and Minos.
I have mentioned, that Cadmus was the same as the Egyptian Thoth; and it is manifest from his being Hermes, and from the invention of letters being attributed to him. Similar to the account given of Cadmus is the history of a personage called by the Greeks Caanthus; this history contains an epitome of the voyage undertaken by Cadmus, though with some small variation. Caanthus is said to have been the son of Oceanus; which in the language of Egypt is the same as the son of Ogus, and Oguges; a different
name for the same [1120]person. Ogus, and with the reduplication Ogugus, was the same as Ogyges, in whose time the flood was supposed to have happened. Ogyges is represented both as a king of Thebes in Egypt, and of Thebes in Bœotia: and in his time Cadmus is said to have left the former country, and to have come to the latter, being sent in quest of his sister Europa by his father. Caanthus was sent by his father with a like commission. His sister Melia had been stolen away; and he was ordered to search every country, till he found her. He accordingly traversed many seas, and at last lauded in Greece, and passed into Bœotia. Here he found, that his sister was detained by Apollo in the grove of Ismenus. There
was a fountain [1121]of the same name near the grove, which was guarded by a dragon. Caanthus is said to have cast fire into this sacred recess; on which account he was slain by Apollo. His ταφος, or tomb, was in aftertimes shewn by the Thebans. We may perceive, that the main part of this relation agrees with
that of Cadmus. Melie, the sister of Caanthus, is by some spoken of as the mother of [1122]Europa: which shews, that there is a correspondence between the two histories. The person also, who sent these two adventurers, the sister, of whom they went in quest, and the precise place, to which they both came, exhibit a series of circumstances so similar, that we need not doubt, but that it is one and the same
history. It is said, that Caanthus threw fire into the sacred [1123]grove: which legend, however misconstrued, relates to the first establishment of fire-worship at Thebes in the grove of Apollo Ismenius. The term Ismenius is compounded of Is-Men, ignis Menis. Meen, Menes, Manes, was one of the most antient titles of the Egyptian God Osiris, the same as Apollo, and Caanthus. What has been mentioned about Cadmus and Caanthus, is repeated under the character of a person named Curnus; who
is said to have been sent by his father Inachus in search of his sister [1124]Io. Inachus, Oceanus, Ogugus, and Agenor, are all the same personages under different names; and the histories are all the same.
That Cadmus was of old esteemed a Deity may be farther proved from his being worshipped at Gortyna
in Crete, as we learn from [1125]Solinus. Iidem Gortynii et Cadmum colunt, Europæ fratrem. He had
moreover an Heroum at Sparta, which was erected by people styled the sons of [1126]Huræus. We learn from Palæphatus, that according to some of the antient mythologists, Cadmus was the person, who slew
the serpent [1127]at Lerna. And according to Nonnus he contended with the giant Typhasus, and restored
to Jupiter his lost [1128]thunder. By this is meant, that he renewed the rites, and worship of the Deity, which had been abolished. These are circumstances, which sufficiently shew, that Cadmus was a different personage, from what he is generally imagined. There was a hill in Phrygia of his name, and
probably sacred to him; in which were the fountains of the river [1129]Lycus. There was also a river Cadmus, which rose in the same mountain, and was lost underground. It soon afterwards burst forth again, and joined the principal stream. Mountains and rivers were not denominated from ordinary personages. In short Cadmus was the same as Hermes, Thoth, and Osiris: under which characters more than one person is alluded to, for all theology of the antients is of a mixed nature. He may principally be esteemed Ham, who by his posterity was looked up to as the Sun, and worshipped under his titles: a circumstance, however, which was common to all, who were styled Baalim. That he was the same as Ham, will appear from the etymology of his name. I have before shewn, that the Sun was styled
[1130]Achad, Achon, and Achor: and the name, of which we are treating, is a compound of [1131]AchadHam, rendered by the Greeks Acadamus and Academus, and contracted Cadmus. Many learned men have thought, that the place at Athens called Academia was founded by Cadmus, and denominated from
him: and of the latter circumstance I make no doubt. [1132]Ab hoc Cadmo Eruditi Academiam, quasi Cadmiam deducunt: quo nomine indigitari locum musis studiisque sacratum notissimum est. The true name of Cadmus, according to this supposition, must have been, as I have represented, Acadamus; or, as



the Ionians expressed it, Academus, to have Academia formed from it. Herodotus informs us, that, when
the Cadmians came to Attica, they introduced a new system of [1133]Architecture; and built temples in a style different from that to which the natives had been used. And he describes these buildings as erected at some distance from those of the country. This was the situation of the place called Academia, which
stood at the distance of a few furlongs from [1134]Athens. It was a place of exercise and science; and by all accounts finely disposed: being planted with a variety of trees, but particularly Olives, called here (Μοριαι) Moriæ. There were likewise springs, and baths for the convenience of those who here took their exercise. The tradition among the Athenians was, that one Ecademus, or Academus, founded it in
antient times; from whom it received its name. Laërtius styles him the hero Ecademus: [1135]Απο τινος Ἡρωος ωνομασθη Εκαδημου. And Suidas to the same purpose; Απο Εκαδημου τινος Ἡρωος
ονομασθεν. But Eupolis, the comic writer, who was far prior, speaks of him as a Deity: [1136]Εν
ευσκιοις δρυμοισιν Ακαδημου Θεου. The trees, which grew within the precincts, were looked upon
as very sacred, [1137]οντως ἱεραι, and the place itself in antient times was of so great sanctity, that it
was a profanation to laugh there; [1138]προτερον εν Ακαδημιᾳ μηδε γελασαι εξουσιαν ειναι.
The Ceramicus at Athens had the same name; and it was undoubtedly given from the same personage. Ακαδημια. καλειται δε ὁυτως ὁ Κεραμικος. Hesych. The common notion was, that it was
denominated from the hero [1139]Ceramus, the son of Dionusus. This arose from the common mistake; by which the place was put for the person, to whom it was sacred, and whose name it bore. Ham was the supposed hero: and Ceramus was Cer-Ham, the tower or temple of Ham, which gave name to the inclosure. This abuse of terms is no where more apparent than in an inscription mentioned by Gruter; where there is a mixed title of the Deity formed from his place of worship.
[1140]Malacæ Hispaniæ. MARTI CIRADINO TEMPLUM COMMUNI VOTO ERECTUM.
Cir-Adon was the temple of Adon, or Adonis; the Amonian title of the chief God. In like manner near
mount Laphystium in Bœotia, the God [1141]Charops was worshipped, and styled Hercules Charops. But Char-Ops, or Char-Opis, signified the temple of the serpent Deity: and was undoubtedly built of old by the people named Charopians, and Cyclopians; who were no other than the antient Cadmians.
Ceramicus was an Egyptian name; and one of the gates or towers of the gates at [1142]Naucratis in that country was so called. It was also the name of an harbour in Caria, probably denominated from some
building at the [1143]entrance.
I may possibly be thought to proceed too far in abridging history of so many heroic personages, upon whose names antiquity has impressed a reverence; and whose mighty actions have never been disputed. For though the dress and colouring may have been thought the work of fancy, yet the substance of their history has been looked upon as undeniably true. To which I answer, that it was undoubtedly founded in truth: and the only way to ascertain what is genuine, must be by stripping history of this unnatural veil, with which it has been obscured; and to reduce the whole to its original appearance. This may be effected upon the principles which I have laid down; for if instead of Perseus, or Hercules, we substitute bodies of men, who went under such titles, the history will be rendered very probable, and consistent. If instead of one person, Cadmus traversing so much ground, and introducing the rites of his country at Rhodes, Samos, Thera, Thasus, Samothrace, and building so many cities in Libya, we suppose these things to have been done by colonies, who were styled Cadmians, all will be very right, and the credibility of the history not disputed. Many difficulties may by these means be solved, which cannot otherwise be explained: and great light will be thrown upon the mythology of the antients.
The story then of Cadmus, and Europa, relates to people from Egypt, and Syria, who went abroad at different times, and settled in various parts. They are said to have been determined in their place of residence by an ox, or cow: by which this only is meant, that they were directed by an oracle: for without such previous inquiry no colonies went abroad. An oracle by the Amonians was termed Alphi, and Alpha, the voice of God. In Egypt the principal oracular temples were those of the sacred animals Apis and Mneuis. These animals were highly reverenced at Heliopolis, and Memphis, and in other cities of that country. They were of the male kind; but the honours were not confined to them; for the cow and heifer were held in the like veneration, and they were esteemed equally prophetic. Hence it was, that they were in common with the Apis and Mneuis styled Alphi, and Alpha: which name was likewise current among the Tyrians, and Sidonians. In consequence of this, Plutarch, speaking of the letter Alpha,
says, [1144]Φοινικας ὁυτω καλειν τον Βουν. The Phenicians call an ox Alpha. And Hesychius
speaks to the same purpose. Αλφα, βους. Thus we find that Alpha was both an oracle, and an oracular animal. The Grecians took it in the latter acceptation; and instead of saying that the Cadmians acted in obedience to an oracle, they gave out, that Cadmus followed a cow. What is alluded to in the animal,



which was supposed to have been his guide, may be known by the description given of it by Pausanias: [1145]Επι δε ἑκατερας της βοος πλευρας σημειον επειναι λευκον, εικασμενον κυκλῳ της Σεληνης. There was a white mark on each side of the cow like the figure of the moon. The poet quoted
by the Scholiast upon Aristophanes speaks to the same purpose. [1146]Λευκον σχημ' ἑκατερθε
περιπλοκον, ηυτε Μηνης. This is an exact description of the [1147]Apis, and other sacred kine in Egypt: and the history relates to an oracle given to the Cadmians in that country. This the Grecians have represented, as if Cadmus had been conducted by a cow: the term Alphi, and Alpha, being liable to be
taken in either of these acceptations. Nonnus speaks of Cadmus as bringing the rites of [1148]Dionusus, and Osiris, from Egypt to Greece: and describes him according to the common notion as going in quest
of a bull, and as being determined in his place of residence by a [1149]cow. Yet he afterwards seems to allude to the true purport of the history; and says, that the animal spoken of was of a nature very different from that, which was imagined: that it was not one of the herd, but of divine original.
[1150]Καδμε ματην περιφοιτε, πολυπλανον ιχνος ἑλισσεις· Μαστευεις τινα Ταυρον, ὁν ου βοεη τεκε γαστηρ.
Under the character of Europa are to be understood people styled Europians from their particular mode of worship. The first variation from the purer Zabaism consisted in the Ophiolatria, or worship of the serpent. This innovation spread wonderfully; so that the chief Deity of the Gentile world was almost universally worshipped under this symbolical representation. The serpent among the Amonians was styled Oph, Eph, and Ope: by the Greeks expressed Οφις, Οπις, Ουπις: which terms were continually combined with the different titles of the Deity. This worship prevailed in Babylonia, Egypt, and Syria: from which countries it was brought by the Cadmians into Greece. Serpentis eam venerationem
acceperunt Græci a Cadmo. [1151]Vossius. It made a part in all their [1152]mysteries; and was attended with some wonderful circumstances: of which I have before made some mention in the treatise de Ophiolatriâ. Colonies, which went abroad, not only went under the patronage, but under some title of their God: and this Deity was in aftertimes supposed to have been the real conductor. As the Cadmians, and Europians, were Ophitæ, both their temples, and cities, also the hills, and rivers, where they settled, were often denominated from this circumstance. We read of Anopus Asopus, Oropus, Europus, Charopus, Ellopis, Ellopia; all nearly of the same purport, and named from the same object of worship.
Europa was a [1153]Deity: and the name is a compound Eur-Ope, analogous to Canope, Canophis, and Cnuphis of Egypt; and signifies Orus Pytho. It is rendered by the Greeks as a feminine, upon a supposition, that it was the name of a woman; but it related properly to a country; and we find many places of the like etymology in Media, Syria, and Babylonia: which were expressed in the masculine Europos, and Oropus. The same also is observable in Greece.
I have shewn, that Cadmus was Taut, or Thoth; the Taautes of Sanchoniathon. It is said of this person, that he first introduced the worship of the serpent: and this so early, that not only the Tyrians and Sidonians, but the Egyptians received it from him. From hence we may infer, that it came from [1154]Babylonia, [1155]Την μεν ουν του Δρακοντος φυσιν, και των οφεων, αυτος εξεθειασεν ὁ Τααυτος, και μετ' αυτον αυθις Φοινικες τε, και Αιγυπτιοι.
The learned writers, who have treated of the Cadmians, have failed in nothing more, than in not considering, that they were a twofold colony, which came both from Egypt, and Syria: from Egypt first; and then from Syria, and Canaan. In their progress westward they settled in Cyprus, Crete, Rhodes, Samos, Lesbos, Thrace: also in Eubœa, Attica, and Bœotia. In process of time they were enabled to make settlements in other parts, particularly in Epirus and Illyria: and to occupy some considerable provinces in Italy as high up as the Padus. Wherever they passed they left behind them numberless memorials: but they are to be traced by none more plainly than by their rites, and worship. As they occupied the greatest part of Syria, that country was particularly addicted to this species of idolatry. Many temples were erected to the Ophite God: and many cities were denominated from him. Both
[1156]Appian and Stephanus Byzantinus mention places in Syrophenicia called Oropus. Upon the
Euphrates also in Mesopotamia were the cities [1157]Amphipolis, and [1158]Dura, both called of old Oropus. The chief Syrian God had the title of Bel, Baal, and Belial: which last the Greeks rendered Βελιαρ. Hence Clemens instead of saying, what agreement can there be between Christ and Belial, says
[1159]Τις δε συμφωνησις Χριστου προς ΒΕΛΙΑΡ. This Belial, or Beliar, was the same as Belorus, and Osiris, who were worshipped under the symbol of a serpent. Hence Hesychius explains the term Beliar by a serpent. Βελιαρ—δρακων. Beliar is the same as a dragon or serpent. The Cadmians are said to have betaken themselves to Sidon, and Biblus: and the country between these cities is called Chous at this day. To the north is the city, and province of Hama: and a town, and castle, called by
D'Anville Cadmus; by the natives expressed Quadamus, or [1160]Chadamus. The Cadmians probably founded the temple of Baal Hermon in Mount Libanus, and formed one of the Hivite nations in those
parts. Bochart has very justly observed, that an Hivite is the same as an [1161]Ophite: and many of this



denomination resided under Mount Libanus, and Anti-Libanus; part of which was called Baal Hermon,
as we learn from the sacred writings. [1162]Now these are the nations, which the Lord left to prove Israel, namely, five Lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians; and the Hivites that dwell in Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. There were
other Hivites, who are mentioned by Moses among the children of [1163]Canaan. But the Cadmonites, and many of the people about Mount Libanus were of another family. The Hivites of Canaan Proper
were those, who by a stratagem obtained a treaty with [1164]Joshua. Their chief cities were Gibeon,
Cephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim. These lay within the the tribe of [1165]Judah, and of Benjamin, who possessed the southern parts of Canaan. But the other Hivites, among whom were the Cadmonites, lay far to the north under Libanus, at the very extremities of the country. The sacred writer distinguishes them from the Canaanites, as well as from the other Hivites, by saying, the Hivites of Baal Hermon. And he seems to distinguish the Sidonians from the genuine Canaanites, and justly: for if we may credit prophane history, the Cadmians had obtained the sovereignty in that city: and the people were of a
mixed race. [1166]Καδμος—Τυρου και Σιδωνος εβασιλευεν. The Cadmians extended themselves in these parts quite to the Euphrates, and westward to the coast of Greece, and Ausonia; and still farther to
the great Atlantic. They went under the name of Ellopians, Oropians, [1167]Cadmonites, Hermonians, Ophitæ, and wherever they settled there will be always found some reference to their antient history, and religion. As they were particularly styled Ophitæ, or Hivites, many places whither they came, were
said to swarm with [1168]serpents. Rhodes was under this predicament, and had the name of Ophiusa: which name was given on account of the Hivites, who there settled, and of the serpent-worship, which they introduced. But the common notion was, that it was so called from real serpents, with which it was
infested. The natives were said to have been of the giant race, and the [1169]Heliadæ or offspring of the Sun; under which characters the antients particularly referred to the sons of Chus, and Canaan. Their coming to the island is alluded to under the arrival both of Danaus and Cadmus, by whom the rites, and
[1170]religion of the Rhodians are supposed to have been introduced. In Greece were several cities
named Oropus, by which is signified Ori Serpentis civitas. One of these was near [1171]Tanagia upon the border of Attica, and Bœotia. This is the very spot where the Cadmians first resided: and the city was undoubtedly built by them. It stood near the warm baths of Amphiaraus, whose temple belonged to the Oropians; and who was particularly worshipped by them. We are informed by Strabo, that the temple of
Amphiaraus was built either in imitation, or in memory, of one called Cnopia at [1172]Thebes. Cnopia is a contraction for Can-Opia; and the temple was certainly founded by people from Egypt. It took its name from Can-ope, or Can-opus, the Ophite God of that country; and of the people likewise, by whom the building was erected. The natives of Bœotia had many memorials of their having been originally Ophites. The history of their country had continual references to serpents and dragons. They seem to have been the national insigne: at least they were esteemed so by the people of Thebes. Hence we find, that upon the tomb of Epaminondas there was figured a shield with a serpent for a device, to signify that
he was an Ophite, or [1173]Theban. The Spartans were of the same race: and there is said to have been
the same device upon the shield of [1174]Menelaus, and of [1175]Agamemnon. The story of Cadmus, and of the serpent, with which he engaged upon his arrival in Bœotia, relates to the Ophite worship, which was there instituted by the Cadmians. So Jason in Colchis, Apollo in Phocis, Hercules at Lerna, engaged with serpents, all which are histories of the same purport; but mistaken by the later Grecians.
It will not, I think, be amiss to take notice of some of those countries westward, to which Cadmus is said to have betaken himself. From Bœotia he is supposed to have passed to Epirus and Illyria; and it is certain, that the Cadmians settled in many places upon that coast. In Thesprotia was a province of the Athamanes; who were denominated from their Deity Ath-Man, or Ath-Manes. Here were the rivers
Acheron, and Cocytus, the lake Acherusia, and the pestiferous pool [1176]Aornon Here was the city
Acanthus similar to one of the same name about forty miles above [1177]Memphis: and a nation of
people called [1178]Oreitæ: all which have a reference to Egypt. The oracle at Dodona was founded by
people from the same country, as we are assured by [1179]Herodotus and others. And not only colonies from that country, but people from Canaan must have betaken themselves to these parts, as is evident
from names of places. This will appear from the city [1180]Phœnice: and from another near Oricum, called Palæste; and from the coast and region styled Palæstina. This was the spot where Cæsar landed,
before he marched to Pharsalia. [1181]Postridie terram attigit Cerauniorum saxa inter, et alia loca periculosa, quietam nactus stationem. At portus omnes timens, quod teneri ab adversariis arbitrabatur, ad eundem locum, qui adpellatur Palæste, omnibus navibus incolumibus, milites exposuit. Lucan takes notice of the same circumstance, and the coast Palæstina.
[1182]Inde rapi cœpere rates, atque æquora classem Curva sequi; quæ jam, vento fluctuque secundo Lapsa, Palæstinas uncis confixit arenas.



Here was the haven Comar, or [1183]Comarus, near the pool Aornus: and a city [1184]Oropus, similar to the Oropus of Syria, and Bœotia. And higher up was a region Europa, styled Europa Scythica by Festus
Rufus. It is observable that there was a city in Epirus called [1185]Tecmon, similar to one in Canaan, as
we may infer from the chief of David's captains being styled the [1186]Tecmonite.
Some of this family proceeded to the western part of the Adriatic gulf, and settled upon the Eridanus, or Po. Here were the Orobians, the same as the Oropians, whose chief city was Comus: near which the
consul Marcellus overthrew the [1187]Galli Insubres. The story of Phaethon, who was supposed to have fallen into the Eridanus, is manifestly of Egyptian original; as the fable of Cycnus is from Canaan.
Phaethon is by some represented as the first king, who reigned in [1188]Chaonia, and Epirus. He was in reality the same as Osiris, the Sun; whose worship was in there very early, as well as upon the Padus. The names of the Deities in every country are generally prefixed to the list of kings, and mistaken accordingly. Cycnus is supposed to have resided not only in Liguria, but in Ætolia, and Phocis. There
was in these parts a lake [1189]Conope, from Cycnus called also [1190]Cycnëa; which names undoubtedly came from Egypt, and Canaan. The colonies upon the Padus left many memorials of their original; especially those, who were from the Caphtorim of Palestina. Some of them had carried on a great work
upon the part of the river, where they settled; which from them was called [1191]Fossa Philistina; and
Fossiones Philistinæ. Of this I have made mention [1192]before.
It is said of Cadmus, that at the close of his life, he was, together with his wife Harmonia, changed to a serpent of stone. This wonderful metamorphosis is supposed to have happened at Encheliæ, a town in Illyria, which circumstance is taken notice of by Lucan.
[1193]Tunc qui Dardaniam tenet Oricon, et vagus altis Dispersus sylvis Athamas, et nomine prisco Encheliæ, versi testantes funera Cadmi.
The true history is this. These two personages were here enshrined in a temple, or Petra: and worshipped
under the symbol of a serpent. Scylax Caryandensis, speaking of this part of Illyria, says, [1194]Καδμου
και Ἁρμονιας ὁι λιθοι εισιν ενταυθα, και ἱερον. In this region are two stones sacred to Cadmus, and Harmonia: and there is likewise a temple dedicated to them. Lucan, who calls the place Encheliæ, speaks of the name as of great antiquity. It undoubtedly was of long standing, and a term from the Amonian language. Encheliæ, Εγχελιαι, is the place of En-Chel, by which is signified the fountain of heaven; similar to Hanes, Anorus, Anopus in other parts. The temple was an Ophite Petra: which terms induced people to believe, that there were in these temples serpents petrified. It is possible, that in later times the Deity may have been worshipped under this form: whence it might truly be said of Cadmus, and Harmonia, that they would one day be exhibited in stone.
[1195]Λαϊνεην ημελλον εχειν οφιωδεα μορφην.
But the notion in general arose from a mistake; and was owing to a misinterpretation of the word Petra. On this account many personages were said to have undergone this change. Pollux, who was of a character superior to what is generally imagined, was said to have been turned to a stone.
[1196]Εις λιθον αυτοτελεστον εμορφωθη Πολυδευκης.
Ariadne underwent the like [1197]change. Also Battus, Atlas, [1198]Alcmena, and others. All these histories relate to personages, enshrined in temples styled Petra, who had a στυλος or rude pillar erected to their honour. This was the usage in all parts, before the introduction of images. There are allusions to these Ophite temples, and to these pillars, upon the coins of Syria, and Tyre. Upon these the
Deity is represented between two rough stones, with two [1199]serpents on each side of him. A temple of this sort, which betrayed great antiquity, stood in the vicinity of Thebes, and was called the serpent's
head. Pausanius speaks of it as remaining in his [1200]time. The same author affords another instance in
his account of Achaia; which is attended with some remarkable circumstances. He tells us, [1201]that at Pheræ, a city of that region, was a fountain sacred to Hermes; and the name of it was Hama. Near this fountain were thirty large stones, which had been erected in antient times. Each of these was looked upon as a representative of some Deity. And Pausanias remarks, that instead of images, the Greeks in
times of old universally paid their adoration to rude unwrought [1202]stones.
That the Cadmians were the people, whom I suppose them, may I think be proved from many other circumstances. There are some particulars in the history of these emigrants, by which they may be as effectually distinguished, as by any national mark of feature, or complexion. I have taken notice in a former treatise of the Cuthites, who came from Babylonia and settled in Egypt; and who were afterwards expelled the country. They came under different titles; and were styled Phenicians, Arabians,



and Ethiopians; but they were more particularly distinguished by the name of Oritæ, and of shepherds. These appellations must be carefully kept in remembrance, for they will be found to occur in almost every part of the world, wherever any of this family settled. In the histories above given of Osiris, Dionusus, and others, we find, that the sons of Chus are represented as great travellers, and at the same time general benefactors: and it is to be observed, that the same characters occur in every history: the great outlines are the same in all. They appear to have been zealous worshippers of the Sun; and addicted to the rites of fire: which mode of worship they propagated, wherever they came. They are described as of superior stature, and were reputed the sons of Anac, and Urius, from Canaan, and Babylonia. In respect to science, they seem to have been very eminent, if we consider the times when they lived. They were particularly famed for their knowledge in astronomy, architecture, and music.
They had great sagacity in finding [1203]mines, and consequently were very rich. Lastly, there continually occurs in their history some allusion to shepherds. Every one of these particulars may be met with in the accounts given of the Cadmians: but it was the turn of the times to make every thing centre in their imaginary leader, Cadmus. He is supposed to have found out mines in Cyprus, and Thrace: and to have been the inventor of letters, and the introducer of science. To him are ascribed the temples at Rhodes; and the buildings in Attica and Bœotia. We find him celebrated as a great
[1204]theologist and astronomer: and it is reported of Cadmus, as it was also of Orpheus, that he left
behind him many valuable remains, which [1205]Bion Proconnesius is said to have translated. But all these gifts, so lavishly bestowed upon one person, should be transferred to a people, who went under the name of Cadmians: and in whom all these requisites are to be found. If we make this allowance, the history will be found to be true. This people, in their migrations westward, were accompanied by others from Canaan, and Syria. I have shewn that they settled at Rhodes, where they were called Ophites, or
Hivites. Another of their titles was Heliadæ, or children of the [1206]Sun. They were looked upon as adepts in every branch of science, and particularly famed for their skill in astronomy. They were the first navigators of the seas; and the division of time, with the notification of seasons, is ascribed to them. [1207]Ὁι δε Ἡλιαδαι διαφοροι γεγονοτες των αλλων εν παιδειᾳ διηνεγκαν, και μαλιστα εν Αστρολογιᾳ· εισηγησαντο δε και περι της ναυτιλιας πολλα, πολλα δε και περι τας ὡρας
διεταξαν. All these arts, if we may believe Herodotus, took their rise in [1208]Babylonia: from whence they were carried by the Oritæ into Egypt: and from Egypt westward to Rhodes, and to various parts besides. The Oritæ, or Auritæ, were the same as the Heliadæ, denominated from the great object of their
worship, the Sun. He was among other titles styled [1209]Orites: as we learn from Lycophron: which is
by his Scholiast interpreted the Sun. [1210]Ωριτην θεον, τον αυτον Ἡλιον. The Deity, which is termed Orites, is no other than the Sun. These Heliadæ were Ophitæ; and introduced at Rhodes, and in other places, the worship of the serpent. Hence they occur in Greece under various titles, such as Ellopians, Europians, Oropians, Asopians, and the like, being so denominated from places which they consecrated to Ops, and Opis, the serpent. The Cadmians settled in Eubœa, which was called Ellopia
from Ellops, a supposed brother of [1211]Cothus. Plutarch gives an account of Cothus himself coming to Eubœa in company with another named Arclus. [1212]Κοθος, και Αρκλος, ὁι Ξουθου παιδες εις
Ευβοιαν ἡκον οικησαντες. By Cothus and Arclus are meant Cuthites and Herculeans, people of the same family, who settled in this island. The Oritæ of Egypt were also styled Arabians; and the Arabian nome was denominated from them. The Cadmians, who settled in Eubœa, may be traced under the same
names. Strabo calls the people, who were supposed to attend Cadmus, Arabians, [1213]Αραβες, ὁι συν
Καδμῳ. One district in the island was denominated from them, Æthiopium: [1214]Αιθιοπιον, ονομα
χωριου εν Ευβοιᾳ. This is more particularly described by Stephanus, as the passage is happily
corrected by Salmasius. Αιθιοπιον, χωριον Ευβοιας παρα Δηλιου, πλησιον του Ευριπου. There is a part of Eubœa hard by Delium, and near to the Euripus, called Ethiopium. But the most critical
mark, by which any of these islands were distinguished, was that of [1215]Oritæ. This is the express title of the shepherds in Egypt; which they assumed both on account of the Deity, whom they worshipped, and in reference to the city Ur in Chaldea, from whence they were in part derived. They founded a city
of the same name in Eubœa, which the Greeks expressed [1216]Oria: whence came the provincial title of
Oritæ. Here Orion was supposed to have been [1217]nursed, whose history we know was from
Babylonia. The natives had a tradition, that he was the son of [1218]Urieus, and of the gigantic race: the purport of which, I think, cannot be mistaken. They passed, as I have shewn, from Eubœa to Attica, and
Bœotia. Here also was a city [1219]Ur, like that in Chaldea, and a tradition about Orion being born in
these parts. They likewise pretended to shew his [1220]tomb. This city Ur, or Uria, was in the district of Tanagra, and stood directly opposite to the province of Ethiopia in Eubœa, being separated only by the
narrow frith of the [1221]Euripus. They settled also at Træzen, where Orus is said to have resided: by
which we are to understand his worshippers, the Oritæ. [1222]Φασι δε Ωρον γενεσθαι σφισιν εν γῃ πρωτον· εμοι μεν ουν Αιγυπτιον φαινεται, και ουδαμως Ἑλληνικον ονομα Ωρος ειναι. Βασιλευσαι δ' ουν φασιν αυτον, και Ωραιαν απ' αυτου καλεισθαι την γην. The people of Træzen, says Pausanias, give out, that one Orus was the first in their country. But the name Orus to me



seems to have been of Egyptian original. They farther relate, that this Orus was a king, and that the province was from him called Oraia. Uria above, and Oraia here, however differently expressed, signify literally the land of Ur. In all these places the Cuthites went under various appellations, but particularly
of Cyclopians, Ellopians, and [1223]Europians from their worship. Agreeably to the account which has been above given, we find, that the Heroum of Cadmus at Sparta was built by Europus, and his brethren:
and they likewise are represented as the sons of [1224]Uræus. As we are acquainted with the eastern manner of speaking; and know that by the daughter of Tyre, the daughter of Jerusalem, the children of Moab, the children of Kedar, the children of Seir, the children of the east, are meant the inhabitants of those places: may we not be assured that by Europus and the sons of Urius and Uræus, are pointed out a people styled Europians of Babylonish extraction, who were ab origine from Ur in Chaldea? And is it not plain, that the history of Cadmus is founded upon terms ill understood, and greatly misapplied? Yet the truth is not totally defaced, as I hope, that I have made appear. By Moses Chorenensis Cadmus is
represented as of the giant race; and he is said to have come from [1225]Babylonia. Nonnus mentions his planting in Greece a colony of giants.
[1226]Και σταχυς αυτολοχευτος ανηεξητο Γιγαντων.
Hence the Cadmians were styled Ανακες, and [1227]Ανακτες; and the temples of their Gods,
Ανακτορια, Anactoria. These terms were imported from the Anakim of Egypt and Canaan: but as the people, who brought them, were Oritæ, and the sons of Urius, they must ultimately have come from Babylonia. Here astronomy, and the other sciences first commenced; and the worship of the Sun was
first instituted: where the priests, and professors were styled Oritæ, and [1228]Orchani. Lucian indeed says, that astronomy was not derived to the Greeks either from the Egyptians, or the Ethiopians; but
from [1229]Orpheus. This however intimates, that the Ethiopians, under which name the sons of Chus
are mentioned by the [1230]Greeks, were supposed to have introduced science into this country; otherwise this caveat had been unnecessary. But we shall in the end shew, that Orpheus was from the same quarter. And to put the matter out of all doubt, we find Herodotus maintaining very determinately, that the knowledge of the heavens, and every thing relating to the distribution of time, was imported
from [1231]Babylonia. As these Babylonians, these sons of Urius, manifestly came to Greece by the way of Egypt, it appears pretty evident, that they were the sons of Chus, of the shepherd race, who so long held the sovereignty in that kingdom. Hence it is, that throughout the whole mythology of the Grecians there are continual allusions to shepherds; a title, which we know was peculiar to the Auritæ of Egypt. Nonnus, in his allegorical poem, describes Cadmus in a pastoral habit, playing upon an instrument, and reclining himself under the shade of an oak.
[1232]Κλινας γειτονι νωτον ὑπο δρυι φορβαδος ὑλης, Και φορεων αγραυλον αηθεος ἑιμα Νομηος.
He gives to him the same powers in harmony which were attributed to Orpheus. Hence Cadmus is made to say that he could charm the woods upon the mountains, and sooth the wild beasts of the forest: that he could even calm the ocean, and stop the course of its turbulent waters.
[1233]Θελξω δενδρεα παντα, και ουρεα, και φρενα θηρων· Ωκεανον σπευδοντα παλινδινητον ερυξω.
Almost all the principal persons, whose names occur in the mythology of Greece and Italy, are represented as shepherds. Not only the Gods Faunus, Apollo, Pan, Sylvanus, Pales, Adonis, but Eumelus, Triptolemus, Ericthonius, Eumolpus, Aristæus, Battus, Daphnis, Terambus of Egypt, and Osiris, are represented of that profession. Hence it is, that we find altars, and inscriptions to the
shepherd [1234]Gods. Apollo was styled Νομευς, and Ποιμνιος; and was said to have been educated in
[1235]Arabia. When Rhea produced to the world Poseidon, she gave him to the care of a [1236]shepherd to bring him up among the flocks. Atlas, the great astronomer, is represented as a shepherd. [1237]Ατλας μαθηματικος ην Λιβυς ανηρ.—Πολυειδος δε ὁ διθυραμβοποιος τον Ατλαντα τουτον ΠΟΙΜΕΝΑ Λιβυν φησιν. Atlas the great mathematician, was a person of Libya. The Dithyrambic poet Polueidos says, that Atlas was a Libyan shepherd. There was a tradition that the
temple of Ammon in Libya was built by a shepherd, from whom it received its name; [1238]απο του
ἱδρυσαμενου ποιμενος. It is reported of the Muses, that they were of shepherd extraction, and tended flocks, which they entrusted to their favourite Aristæus.
[1239]Και μιν ἑων μηλων θεσαν ηρανον, ὁσσ' ενεμοντο Αμπεδιον Φθιαν Αθαμαντιον, αμφι τ' ερυμνην Οθρυν, και ποταμου ἱερον ῥοον Απιδανοιο.



This is the person by Virgil styled Pastor Aristæus. Zethus and Amphion are described as of the same profession, though kings of Thebes, [1240]Ζηθος δε και Αμφιων αδελφοι ησαν ποιμενες. Even the
monster Polyphemus is taken notice of as a musician, and a [1241]shepherd. Macrobius mentions, that
among the Phrygians the Sun was worshipped under a pastoral [1242]character, with a pipe and a wand. Tiresias, the prophet, is by Hyginus styled Tiresias, Eueri filius, or as some read it, Tiresias, Eurii filius,
[1243]Pastor. This was also one of the titles out of many conferred upon the Phenician Hercules, to whom they attributed the invention of purple. He was the chief Deity, the same as Cham, and Orus, the God of light; to whom there is a remarkable invocation in the Dionusiaca of Nonnus.
[1244]Αστροχιτων Ἡρακλες, αναξ πυρος, Ορχαμε κοσμου, Ηελιε, βροτεοιο βιου δολιχοσκιε ΠΟΙΜΗΝ.
Some of the pyramids in Egypt were styled the pyramids of the shepherd [1245]Philitis; and were said to have been built by people, whom the Egyptians held in abomination: from whence we may form a judgment of the persons, by whom those edifices were erected. Many hills, and places of reputed sanctity were denominated from shepherds. Caucasus, in the vicinity of Colchis, had its name conferred by Jupiter in memory of Caucasus a shepherd. [1246]Το ορος εις τιμην του Ποιμενος Καυκασον
μετονομασας. Mount Cithæron in Bœotia was called Asterius; but received the former name from one
Cithæron, a [1247]shepherd, supposed to have been there slain. I have mentioned from Herodotus, that
the Cadmians built the temple of [1248]Damater, or Ceres, in Attica, where they introduced her worship. And there is a remarkable circumstance mentioned in consequence of this by Hesychius, who tells us, that the priests of this Goddess were of a particular family, called Ποιμενιδαι, or the Shepherd race.
Ποιμενιδαι, γενος, εξ ὁυ ὁ Δημητρος ἱερευς. The Cadmians therefore, from whom this priesthood came, must have been in a peculiar manner shepherds. The mountain Apæsantus in Argolis is said to
have been named from [1249]Apæsantus, a shepherd. The Cuthites settled in Thrace near Hæmus, in Sethonia; of whom Stephanus gives this short but remarkable history: εκαλουντο προτερον
Νομαιοι. The author does not say, that they were shepherds; but that they antiently were so called: so that it was not so much the profession, as the title of the people. They settled in Hetruria, and Latium; in which last province stood the city Præneste, of which I have before spoken. It was said to have been of high antiquity, and was founded by Cœculus,
[1250]Vulcano genitum pecora inter agrestia Regem, Inventumque focis, omnis quem credidit ætas.
We find here, that the founder of this city was a shepherd, and a king, and the reputed son of Vulcan, the same as Urius. It is said of him, that he was, inventum focis, because he was ab origine from the land of fire; by which is meant Ur of Chaldea. So the personage, represented under the character of Cacus upon
Mount Aventine, is by Livy said to have been a shepherd. [1251]Pastor accola ejus loci, nomine Cacus,
ferox viribus. He likewise is said to have been the son of the God of Fire: [1252]Huic monstro Vulcanus
erat pater. The first city which the Cadmians built in Bœotia was named [1253]Poimandris; or as
Eustathius renders it Poimandria, [1254]Ποιμανδρια; the same which was afterwards called Tanagra. It is said to have been so denominated from one Poimander. This name is by interpretation a shepherd, or rather a shepherd of men. It answers to the title of Ποιμην λαου, so frequently to be met with in Homer. That excellent Poet was wonderfully fond of every thing, which savoured of antiquity: and has continual references to the antient history of Egypt, and to the rites of that country. He sometimes seems to adhere superstitiously to obsolete terms, thinking probably, that they enriched his verse, and gave a venerable air to the narration. Of these, no one occurs more frequently than the title of a shepherd Prince, which he bestows on many of his leaders. It is the translation of a title, which the sons of Chus, as well as the Egyptians, gave to their Deities, and to their kings. Hence the writings of Hermes were inscribed the works of the Shepherd Prince, as we may infer from the Greek transcript: for that was
written in imitation of the former, and called [1255]Poimandras.
Thus have I endeavoured to state the progress of the Cuthites under their different appellations to Greece; and to describe the rout which they took in their peregrinations, I have shewn, that under the title of Phenicians and Cadmians, they first settled in Canaan, and in the region about Tyre and Sidon: from whence they extended themselves towards the midland parts of Syria; where they built Antioch. [1256]Κασος, και Βηλος, Ιναχου παιδες, προς τῳ Οροντῃ ποταμῳ την νυν Αντιοχειαν της Συριας πολιν εκτισαν. Casus, and Belus, two sons of Inachus, built the city in Syria, which is now called Antioch upon the river Orontes. By Casus is meant Chus; and Belus is a Babylonish title of Ham, as well as of his immediate descendants, who are here alluded to. From Syria they penetrated to the Euphrates, and from thence to Armenia: and that there were colonies here of Amonians, and particularly of the Cuthites, may be known from the history of Cadmus: but more especially from the similitude of



language, person, and manners, which subsisted among these [1257]nations. Zonaras is very explicit upon this head. He mentions the incroachments of the sons of Ham in these parts, and shews the extent of the trespass, of which they were guilty. [1258]Ὁιδε γε παιδες του Χαμ την απο Συριας και Αβανου και Λιβανου των ορων γην κατεσχον, και ὁσα προς θαλασσαν αυτων ετετραπτο, μεχρις ωκεανου, κατειληφασι. In respect to the sons of Ham, they seized upon all the inland country, which reaches from Syria, and particularly from the mountains Albanus, and Libanus: and all the region, which from thence extends towards the sea, even as far as the Ocean. Of these emigrants Tacitus has given a curious account, which has never been sufficiently heeded. He takes notice of those
who settled in Canaan, as well as those who passed higher towards the north. [1259]Sunt, qui tradant
Assyrios convenas, indigum agrorum populum, parte Ægypti potitos, ac mox [1260]proprias urbes, Hebræasque terras, et propiora Syriæ coluisse. As the Cadmians settled about Byblus and Sidon, there seems in consequence of it to have been a religious correspondence kept up between this colony and Egypt. It is said according to the enigmatical turn of the times, that the head of Osiris was annually
wafted by the floods to [1261]Byblus. It was reported to have been just seven days in its passage; and the whole was performed θειῃ ναυτιλιῃ, by a voyage truly miraculous. There are many proofs that the religion of Syria came in great measure from Egypt. The rites of Adonis, and the lamentations upon his account at Sidon, and Byblus, were copies of the mourning for Osiris, and represented in the same
[1262]manner. Lucian, having described the pompous temple at Hierapolis, says, that there was another in the neighbourhood, not of Assyrian, but Egyptian original; the rites of which were received by the
natives from Heliopolis in that [1263]country. This he did not see: but speaks of it as very grand, and of high antiquity.
These particulars I have thought proper to discuss thoroughly, in order to disclose the true history of the Cadmians, as I am hereby enabled to prove the great antiquity of this people; and to shew who they were, and from whence they came. It has been observed by many of the learned, that some particular race of men spread themselves abroad, and got access among numberless nations. Some have thought that they were Scythians: others, that they were Egyptians: others still, that they were from Phenicia, and Canaan. What they have said upon the subject, however they may seem to differ from one another, may in some degree be allowed. But I believe, that the true account is that which I have here given. I have endeavoured, with great pains, to sift the history to the bottom: and it is to me manifest, that they were for the most part the Auritæ, those shepherds of Egypt. This people had spread themselves over that country like a deluge: but were in time forced to retreat, and to betake themselves to other parts. In consequence of this they were dissipated over regions far remote. They were probably joined by others of their family, as well as by the Canaanites, and the Caphtorim of Palestina. They are to be met with in Persis, and Gedrosia, under the name of Oritæ. They are to be found in Bœtica upon the Atlantic under
the same [1264]name. They settled in Colchis, Thrace, Phrygia, Sicily, and Hetruria; and upon the extreme parts of the Mediterranean: Diluvio ex illo tot vasta per æquora vecti.
These are the migrations, of which the antient historian [1265]Istrus wrote in a curious treatise, long since lost; which he inscribed περι των Αιγυπτιων αποικιας. We meet with a summary account of them in Diodorus Siculus, who mentions, that after the death of Isis and Osiris the Egyptians sent out
many colonies, which were scattered over the face of the earth. [1266]Ὁ δε ουν Αιγυπτιοι φασι και
μετα ταυτα αποικιας πλειστας εξ Αιγυπτου κατα πασαν διασπαρηναι την οικουμενην. Of these migrations there were two remarkable above the rest: the one of the sons of Chus, concerning whom I have been treating; the other of the Israelites, which was somewhat later than the former. The author above takes notice of both these occurrences, in a most valuable extract preserved by Photius; wherein he does not sufficiently distinguish the particular families of these emigrants, nor the different times of the migration: yet the account is very curious; and the history of each transaction plainly delineated. [1267]Ευθυς ουν ὁι ξενολατουμενων των αλλοεθνων ὁι επιφανεστατοι, και δραστικωτατοι συστραφεντες εξεῤῥιφησαν, ὡς τινες φασιν, εις την Ἑλλαδα, και τινας ἑτερους τοπους, εχοντες αξιολογους ἡγεμονας· ὡν ἡγουντο Δαναος, και Καδμος, των αλλων επιφανεστατοι. Ὁδε πολυς λεως εξεπεσεν εις την νυν καλουμενην Ιουδαιαν. Upon this, as some writers tell us, the most eminent and enterprising of those foreigners, who were in Egypt, and obliged to leave the country, betook themselves to the coast of Greece, and also to other regions, having put themselves under the command of proper leaders for that purpose. Some of them were conducted by Danaus, and Cadmus, who were the most illustrious of the whole. There were beside these
a large, but less noble, body of people, who retired into the province called now [1268]Judea.
When therefore we speak of the history of Greece as far back as we can carry it, and of the rites and
religion introduced into that country, we may accede to the account given of them by Zonaras. [1269]Εκ
Χαλδαιων γαρ λεγεται φοιτησαι ταυτα προς Αιγυπτον κακειθεν προς Ἑλληνας. All these things came from Chaldea to Egypt; and from thence were derived to the Greeks. The same is attested
by [1270]Josephus. What preceded the arrival of the Cadmians, and other Cuthites, in these parts, is



utterly unknown. With them commences the history of the country. It is true, there are accounts concerning Erectheus, Ericthonius, Cecrops, and other antient kings: but they were superadded to the history of Attica, just as the names of Inachus, Phoroneus, Apis, were to that of Argos. It was therefore matter of great surprise to Solon, when he was informed by the Egyptian priests of the antient occurrences of their country, and of the wars of the Atlantians, to find the same names stand at the head
of their histories, as were observable in those of Greece: [1271]Κεκροπος τε, και Ερεχθεως, και
Εριχθονιου, και Ερισιχθονος, των τε αλλων. For instance, the names of Cecrops, Erectheus,
Ericthonius, Erisicthon, and others. Και τα των Γυναικων και ταυτα. The names also of their women were the same. In reality, they were all titles of the Deity, as might be easily shewn. Erectheus for instance was the God of the sea, and as such worshipped by the very people who enlisted him among
their kings. This may be proved from Athenagoras. [1272]Αθηναιος Ερεχθει Ποσειδωνι θυει. The Athenian sacrifices to Erectheus the same as Poseidon. Strabo seems to think, that most of the antient
names were foreign; [1273]such as Cecrops, and Codrus, and Arclus, and Cothus: and he is certainly right in his opinion.
What I have here said, may in some degree prove a basis for the history of Greece. We may indeed talk of Xuthus, Ion, and Hellen: also of the Leleges, and Pelasgi, and thus amuse ourselves in the dark: but no real emolument can possibly arise, till the cloud, with which history has been so long obscured, be done away. This cannot well be effected, till some of the first principles, upon which we are to proceed, be made out, and these great truths determined.
This inquisition I have been obliged to make concerning some of the principal personages in the annals of Greece. For it is impossible to lay a foundation for a future history unless what is true, and what is false, be previously determined. All those, of whom I have been treating, stand foremost in the lists of antiquity, and have been admitted with too little consideration. Many of the first Fathers in the Christian church, seeing the high pretensions of the Grecians, tried to invalidate their claim, by shewing that all their antient heroes were subsequent to Moses. This was the repeated labour of Clemens of Alexandria, Theophilus, Eusebius, Tatianus, and others. It was a point urged by them continually in their recommendation of the Scriptures, as if priority of time were necessarily a mark of truth. The best chronologers likewise admit these personages in their computations; and great pains have been used to reconcile the contradictions in their histories, and to ascertain the æra when they flourished. These learned men acted upon a very laudable principle, but failed in the very beginning of their process. For, as I have before taken notice, the question should not have been about the time when these persons lived, but whether they ever existed. The fathers proceeded upon very precarious grounds, and brought their evidence to a wrong test. They indeed state things very fairly, and have authorities for all that they advance. But the traditions of the Greeks were not uniform. And if any Gentile writer, instead of carrying the æra of Inachus and Phoroneus, or of Dionusus and Perseus, towards the time of Moses, had extended it to the times of the first kings in Egypt, I do not see what they could have done; for this person, in his turn, could have produced authorities. They might indeed have disputed the point, and have opposed evidence to evidence, but nothing certain could have ensued.

And in another place;

Phaëthon was the same as Phanes: and there is something very mysterious in his character. He is represented as the first born of heaven: Πρωτογονος Φαεθων περιμηκεος Ηερος ὑιος —Hunc ait (Orpheus) esse omnium Deorum parentem; quorum causâ cœlum condiderit, liberisque prospexerit, ut haberent habitaculum, sedemque communem: Εκτισεν Αθανατοις

A remarkable passage, from Isidorus Basilidis, quoted by Clemens Alexandrin. Και γαρ μοι δοκει τους προσποιουμενους φιλοσοφειν, ἱνα μαθωσι, τι εστιν ἡ ὑποπτερος δρυς, και το επ' αυτῃ πεποικιλμενον ΦΑΡΟΣ. Παντα ὁσα Φερεκυδης αλληγορησας εθεολογησεν, λαβων απο της του Χαμ προφητειας. Strom. l. 6. p. 767.
In the former verses from Nonnus we may see the method of deviation. Pharos, a tower, is taken for Pharos a garment; and this altered to Χιτων: and, after all, the genuine history is discernible, notwithstanding the veil which is spread over it. The author says, that, at the bottom, εϋκλωστοιο Χιτωνος, of the well-woven garment, flowed the Ocean, which
surrounded the world. This is certainly a misinterpretation of the term φαρος: and, in the original writings, whence these verses were copied, the history related to a tower: and it was at the foot ΦΑΡΟΥ ΕΥΚΛΥΣΤΟΙΟ that the ocean beat, by which the earth was encircled.

Strabo. l. 16. p. 1095. The epithet πεπτωκως could not properly be given to a serpent: but to a building decayed, and in ruins nothing is more applicable. A serpent creeps upon its belly, and is even with the ground, which he goes over, and cannot fall lower. The moderns indeed delineate dragons with legs: but I do not know that this was customary among the antients.

[587] Pausanias mentions the apartments of the daughters of Prœtus. l. 2. p. 169. But the daughters of Prœtus were property the virgins who officiated at the Purait, the young priestesses ot the Deity.
The Sicilian Cyclopes were three, because there were three towers only, erected upon the islands called Cyclopum Scopuli; and that they were lighthouses is apparent from the name



which still remains: for they are at this day styled Faraglioni, according to Fazellus. The Cyclopes of Tiryns were seven, as we learn from Strabo; because the towers probably were in number so many. From this circumstance we may presume, that the ideas of the antients concerning the Cyclopians, were taken from the buildings which they erected.
[588] The Cyclopian buildings were also called Ouranian. Κυκλωπεια τ' ουρανια τειχεα. Euripid. Electra. v. 1158.
[589] Both Cuclops, and Cuclopes, was the name of a place. We may, therefore, I think, be pretty well assured, that the Cyclopians were from hence denominated. And as sacred places had their names from the Deity, to whom they were dedicated, it is very probable, that the Cuclopian towers were named from Cœlus Ops, the Deity there worshipped: for I have shewn, that this people were the reputed children of Ouranus and Cœlus.

Aster-Ous was a temple on Mount Caucasus: Amath-Ous, the same in Cyprus: Ampel-Ous, a temple in Mauritania: Alphi-Ous, in Elis: Achor-Ous, in Egypt: all dedicated to the Deity, under different titles.

[606] Acmonides is represented as a patronymic; but there is reason to think that it is an Amonian compound, Acmon-Ades, Acmon the God of light, the same as Cœlus, Cronus, and Osiris. Acmon and Acmonides were certainly the same person: Ακμων· Κρονυς, Ουρανος.
Hesych. Ακμονιδης, ὁ Χαρων, και ὁ Ουρανος. ibid. He was the Cyclopian God, to whom different departments were given by the mythologists. Charon Cyclops is mentioned by Lycophron. v. 659. above quoted.

[693] Among the Egyptians, the emblems of which they made use were arbitrary, and very different from the things to which they referred. An eagle, an ox, and a horse, were all used as symbols, but had no real connexion with the things alluded to, nor any the least likeness. The Grecians not considering this were always misled by the type; and never regarded the true history, which was veiled under it.

Zelis was called Azilis: Saba, Azaba: Stura, Astura: Puglia, Apuglia: Busus, Ebusus: Damasec, Adamasec. Azon was therefore the same as Zon; and Azon Nakis may be interpreted Sol Rex, vel Dominus.

[1175] Both Menelaus and Agamemnon were antient titles of the chief Deity. The latter is supposed to have been the same as Zeus, Æther, and Cœlus. He seems to have been worshipped under the symbol of a serpent with three heads. Hence Homer has given to his hero of this name a serpent for a device, both upon his breastplate, and upon his baldrick.

The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States.
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
1.E.1.

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
1.F.
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all



liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.



Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
http://www.gutenberg.org
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.



This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project to make the world’s books discoverable online.
It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that’s often difficult to discover.
Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book’s long journey from the publisher to a library and finally to you.
Usage guidelines
Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. We also ask that you:
+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for personal, non-commercial purposes.
+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google’s system: If you are conducting research on machine translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help.
+ Maintain attribution The Google “watermark” you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it.
+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can’t offer guidance on whether any specific use of any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book’s appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.
