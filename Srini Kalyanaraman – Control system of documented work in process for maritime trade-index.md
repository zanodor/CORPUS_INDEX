Control system of documented work in process for maritime trade
-- in circular working platforms to compile cargo manifest -- ‘unicorn’ seal H-1682 is a maritime treasure-guard cargo manifest -- Harappa 16 tablets are documents of work in process from smelters, smithy-forges for the guild

“Sixteen three sided tablets (c. 2300 BCE) with incised inscription on each face were found all together in the debris that had been dumped over the curtain wall (54). On one of the three sides is an inscription that is identical to the last two signs on the seal.” https://www.harappa.com/indus2/146.html
A square steatite unicorn seal with a unique inscription was found in the street debris on the inside of the city wall. The two sets of signs on the right hand side of the seal would appear in reverse, i.e. be on the left, when it was pressed into clay. Harappan Period, c. 2300 BCE.” https://www.harappa.com/indus2/145.html

Writing system controls production work in Metals manufactory
-- HARP team discovers 22 identical miniature tablets; tokens of smelter work output -- HARP team discovers consolidation of token information on ‘unicorn’ seal; ‘unicorn’+ standard device graphemes signify treasure-guard cargo manifest for maritime trade
The last 2 signs of the seal are the same as those on side A of the 22 incised prism tablets (H2218 to H2239); e.g. H2218A; two signs of Side C of the incised tablets is associated with the most frequent triplet of signs on other tablets (which are wealth account ledgers).

Mounds E and ET; Trench 11: steatite seal H96-2796/6874-01 (H1682A) and incised steatite tablets (22) with the same inscriptions. "The last 2 signs of this seal are the same as those on one side of the 22 tablets (taking three strokes as a single sign)(H2218 to H2239)...Each tablet is three-sided with the inscription on each side comprising a single more complex sign accompanied by three or four simple strokes." The tablets are "incised with script that was to be read directly from the tablet." (Note by J.
