In a brilliant excursus, Jayasree Saranathan provides textual references evidencing Ganeśa as scribe of MBh.
[quote] The next morning (after the coronation of Yudhiṣṭhira), K ̥rṣṇa and the Pāṇḍava-s left for Kurukshetra without the accompaniment of the army...and reached the river Drishadvati and bathed in the river...
The verse runs like this: (Mahabharata: 12-58-30 ) dṛṣad vatīṃ cāpy avagāhya
suvratāḥ; kṛtoda kāryāḥ kṛtajapya maṅgalāḥ upāsya saṃdhyāṃ vidhivat paraṃtapās; tataḥ puraṃ te viviśur gajāhvayam
Meaning: “The destroyers of foes (who happened to be) the strict followers of religious vows bathed in the river Drishadvati in the evening twilight, preformed the prescribed religious vows, worshiped with japa for welfare and happiness according to the prescribed rules and went back home to Hastinapur.”
In addition to the usual ‘Kritoda karya’, they did ‘kṛtajapya maṅgalāḥ upāsya’ MangalaUpāsana is not part of Sandhyopāsana. And this activity getting mentioned specifically on the 2nd day, that happened to be Śukla Caturthi, it implies that they did the worship meant to ward off the evil effect of sighting the 4th phase of the moon!
Seeing the 4th phase (Śukla Caturthi moon) is supposed to bring evil to a person. According to an astrological text on religious austerities, the one who happens to see the 4th phase must immediately do a propitiatory worship to ward off the evil. This practice started after K ̥rṣṇa was blamed for the missing Syamantaka gem, which it was believed to be the result of K ̥rṣṇa having sighted the 4th phase of the moon. Yudhiṣṭhira started this practice which came to be known as Siddhi Vināyaka Vrata in due course.(“ஜ ோதிட வருஷோதி நூல் ” (Tamil), p. 385).
This practice seems to have evolved into the festival of Ganesh Caturthi in Bhadrapada month – the month in all likelihood being the time K ̥rṣṇa watched the 4th phase and subsequently was blamed for the missing gem. This memory had continued until 150 years ago, is known from an entry in the Journal of Literature and Science, by the British writers in describing the Ganesh festival as was celebrated in the then Madras Province. The reference to K ̥rṣṇa having sighted the 4th phase of the moon is reproduced from the Journal.( “The Journal of Literature and Science”, October 1833, J.C.Morris, F.R.S., p.17-18)(Figure 1) The practice of immersing in water the image of Ganeśa worshiped for the event could perhaps be part of the vrat proposed by Yudhiṣṭhira. Perhaps initially they conducted the worship only in water on Shukla Caturthi.

The specific mention of “maṅgalāḥ upāsya” seems to be a reference to Lord Ganeśa, whose form is supposed to be ‘Mangala’. The planet Mars attained the title Mangala after having seen the Mangala form of Ganeśa on his wedding with Siddhi (this gave him the name Siddhi Vinayaka), according to Vinayaka Purana. “Mangalarambha” is an epithet of Ganeśareferring to starting any work after worshiping Ganeśa.
The Caturthi ‘Maṅgalopāsana’ done by the returnees including Vyāsa in that group seems to settle down the controversy over whether Ganeśa as a scribe for Vyāsa was originally present in the text written by Vyāsa. The missing reference to Ganeśa as a scribe in the Southern manuscripts of Mahabharata and its appearance only in 37 out of 59 manuscripts resulted in the dropping of the Ganeśa reference in the critical edition of Mahabharata.
The Shukla Caturthi performance of the vrat having certain prescribed rules goes to show that some method of worship of Ganeśa, the lord of Caturthi tithi, must have been in place at the time of Mahabharata.(Vinayaka was a household deity even as early as Ramayana times. Valmiki says that Vinayaka is fixated in the houses where Ramayana is heard. VR: 6-128116) There is scope to presume that Vyāsa did some form of ‘Maṅgalopāsana’ for the successful completion of the text of Mahabharata that he included it as well in the text as Ganeśa, the scribe. By that he assigned the responsibility of completing the text to Lord Ganeśa, which is very much in line with the purport of the Caturthi vrat done even today...[unquote]
