The myth ‘An and Inanna’ And the Winged Gates depicted on cylinder seals
Number 1
In this imprint a cow carries a so-called 'winged gate' on its back. This composition is depicted on a number of cylinder seals and illustrates two scenes from 'An and Inanna', a myth in which Inanna wants to conquer both heaven and the E-ana (‘House of Heaven’). In this essay we will see that a number of seals depict different scenes from this myth.
Number 2
Inanna, the Lady of Heaven
First of all I would like to introduce you to the main deities of this myth. The first to be mentioned is Inanna, the Lady of heaven. In this imprint she sits on the left with the characteristic flames or rays rising from her shoulders.
Inanna and An
1 line fragmentary Holy Inanna ....... The hero, youthful Utu, ....... At dead of night ....... Eana ....... Inanna ....... The great (?) heavens ....... unknown no. of lines missing

Number 3
An, the god of heaven
The second one is An who sits on his seat in this imprint. He is the god of heaven and here he is indicated by the star in front of him, as one of its meanings is: ‘heaven’.

Number 4
Šul-a-zida
The third god regularly depicted on the imprints is Šul-a-zida. He is the herdsman of An and he has a cosmic tethering rope in his hands.
26-28. Šul-a-zida, An's herdsman, grasped the cosmic tethering rope in his hands. After he had
brought the ...... forth from the sky, he overcame the protective deities. He ...... and kept it below the horizon.

Number 5
All imprints show an impression of the so called 'winged gate'. This one is special because six dots have been added to it. They symbolize number 60 which indicates An, (in the table below he is called Anu), the god of heaven.
http://www.ancientscripts.com/sumerian.html
In Sumer number 10 was symbolized by a small circle. On cylinder seals drill holes form small circles, which means that one drill hole symbolizes 10, two holes symbolize 20, and three holes symbolize 30, etc. These numbers on their turn indicate deities: 10 indicates Iškur/Adad, 20 indicates Utu/Shamash, and 30 indicates Nanna/Suen:
Male: 60 - Anu, 50 -Enlil, 40 - Ea/Enki, 30 - Nanna/Suen, 20 - Utu/Shamash, 10 - Iškur /Adad Female: 55 - Antu, 4.5 - Ninlil, 35 - Ninki, 25 -Ningal, 15 - Inanna/Ishtar, 5 Ninhursag
http://www.rulit.net/books/the-12th-planet-read-299421-25.html (See also page 21.)
This means that these six dots indicate that the gate belongs to the god of heaven, so it must be the gate of the E-ana, the 'House of Heaven'.



Number 6
The gate of the E-ana has wings which may symbolize that this House indeed comes forth from heaven and is therefore not made by human hands:
20-22. Adagbir answered holy Inanna: ‘...... through the reed thickets and the tall reeds. For you ...... find E-ana, which comes forth from heaven.’
23-25. Adagbir, ...... of Enlil, ...... through the reed thickets and the tall reeds. She gazed in admiration at E-ana which comes forth from heaven.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
Number 7
From 'The Temple Hymns' it turns out that the E-ana was built for the bull and that it has seven corners and seven fires:
The temple hymns
O house with the great divine powers of Kulaba, ......, its platform has made the great shrine flourish. Green fresh fruit, marvellous, filled with ripeness, descending from the centre of heaven, shrine built for the bull, E-ana, house with seven corners, with seven fires lifted at night-time, surveying seven pleasures (?), your princess is on the pure horizon.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
This shows that the this House is connected to Taurus and to the seven stars of the Pleiades.
Before we discuss the meaning of the cow, I would like to show you the next imprint:



Number 8a
In this imprint are two stars,
o On the right side is a star that is part of the so-called 'spade'. This star indicates that the seated god deity holding a sceptre is An, the god of heaven. o The other star is situated between a goddess and a god with a stick or a mace. It indicates that this goddess is Inanna, who is also called the ‘Lady of Heaven’:
A cir-namursaja to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan
1-16. I shall greet her who ascends above, her who ascends above, I shall greet the Mistress who ascends above, I shall greet the great lady of heaven, Inana! I shall greet the holy torch who fills the heavens, the light, Inana, her who shines like daylight, the great lady of heaven, Inana! I shall greet the Mistress, the most awesome lady among the Anuna gods; the respected one who fills heaven and earth with her huge brilliance; the eldest daughter of Suen, Inana! For the young lady I shall sing a song about her grandeur, about her greatness, about her exalted dignity; about her radiantly ascending at evening; about her filling the heaven like a holy torch; about her stance in the heavens, as noticeable by all lands, from the south to the highlands, as that of Nanna or of Utu; about the greatness of the mistress of heaven!
20-33. When standing in the heavens she is the good wild cow of An, on earth she instils
respect; she is the lady of all the lands. She received the divine powers in the abzu, in Eridug; her father Enki presented them to her. He placed the lordship and kingship in her hands. She takes her seat on the great dais with An; she determines the fates in her Land with Enlil. Monthly, at the new moon, the gods of the Land gather around her so that the divine powers are perfected. The great Anuna gods, having bowed before them, stand there with prayers and supplications and utter prayers on behalf of all the lands. My lady decrees judgments in due order for the Land. Her black-headed people parade before her.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
In the same text we read that Inanna is the good wild cow of An, and in the next imprint we can see that a star is situated above a cow.



Number 8b
This imprint also depicts two stars:
1. A star of the so-called ‘star-spade’ indicating that the seated god is An, the god of heaven. 2. A star above a cow indicating that this quadruped represents Inanna, the Lady of heaven, who is also called: 'the good wild cow of An (Heaven)' (see above).
In 'An and Inanna', neither the Lady of Heaven nor anyone else is portrayed as a cow. But the tablet of the myth is badly damaged and Inanna might have been described as a cow in the complete version. Nevertheless, on cylinder seals bulls are usually standing up and cows usually lie on the field, like almost all those depicted on the winged gate seals. Lying on the fields these quadrupeds indicate that they are female and thus, in this case, represent Inanna.
Number 8c
Now we are able to understand this imprint, because here we can see that both An, indicated by the star, as well as his herdsman Šul-a-zida are fighting with the Inanna cow who wants to conquer the E-ana she is carrying on her back.
Segment B
1-6. 1 line fragmentary ...... E-ana comes forth from heaven, ...... the lady of heaven set her mind to capturing the great heavens, ...... Inanna set her mind to capturing the great heavens, ...... set her mind to capturing the great heavens from the ...... of heaven, ...... youthful Utu, she set her mind to capturing the great heavens.

Scenes from the myth ‘An and Inanna’ depicted on cylinder seals
This chapter contains the text of the myth ‘An and Inanna’ as it is handed down in the damaged tablets. At various scenes from this text I place imprints of cylinder stamps that depict these scenes, creating a kind of comic strip.
Number 9
We start again with Inanna who in the myth is mentioned first in segment A. In this imprint she sits on a seat at the left:
Segment A
1-7. unknown no. of lines missing 1 line fragmentary Holy Inanna ....... The hero, youthful Utu, ....... At dead of night ....... Eana ....... Inanna ....... The great (?) heavens ....... unknown no. of lines missing

Number 8c
In Segment B she set her mind to capturing the great heavens so a battle ensues, as can be seen on this imprint:
Segment B
1-6. 1 line fragmentary ...... E-ana comes forth from heaven, ...... the lady of heaven set her mind to capturing the great heavens, ...... Inanna set her mind to capturing the great heavens, ...... set her mind to capturing the great heavens from the ...... of heaven, ...... youthful Utu, she set her mind to capturing the great heavens.

Number 11
Taurus Orion Gemini Hydra
In the same segment the sun god Utu says to Inanna: ‘I will follow what my sister says to me, I will follow what holy Inanna says to me’.
Segment B
7-9. Holy Inanna spoke to her brother the hero, youthful Utu: ‘......, I want to tell you something -pay attention to my speech. ......, my twin, I want to tell you something -- pay attention to my speech.’ 10-15. Her brother the hero, youthful Utu, answered holy Inanna: ‘My sister, I swear an oath by the life of heaven, I swear by the life of the rainbow (?) of heaven, my ......, ......, I swear by the life of my throne, by my majesty: I will follow what my sister says to me, I will follow what holy Inanna says to me.’
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
This sentence indicates that Inanna and Utu go on together, in other words they conjunct. This is symbolized in the imprint by Inanna getting into the boat that contains the sun god.
This scene becomes clear when we look at the crescent and the star above the boat.
o The crescent, of course, symbolizes the new moon and in this phase of the moon the sun and the moon conjunct: in other words, they travel through the sky together. o Usually, the new moon is represented in two ways: as a scale or as a boat, as shown in the imprint above. o The star under this crescent signifies Inanna, the Lady of heaven, who calls herself ‘a star’:
Dumuzid and Enkimdu
‘I am a woman and I won't do that, I won't! I am a star ......, and I won't! I won't be the wife of a shepherd!’ Her brother, the warrior youth Utu, said to holy Inanna:
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
o Put together the two symbols indicate that the sun, the moon and the Lady of heaven conjunct. o Mythologically this is expressed by Inanna getting into the boat and sailing together with the young sun god, (and with the helmsman Adagbir) in the moon boat.



Number 2
Inanna complains that An doesn't want to give the E-ana to her husband:
Segment B
16-23. The maiden Inanna answered her brother the hero, youthful Utu: ‘......, my spouse (?), has made love to me, has kissed me. I wanted ...... for him but ...... he did not give it to him. I hastened (?) with him ...... but majestic An would not give him E-ana.’
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
(In the fragmentary tablets her husband is not mentioned by name but he is Dumuzid and here he is represented by the reptile on the left. On another imprint he is indicated by a scorpion and in yet another he is a snake. But more on that later).
Number 10
And thus Inanna wants to capture E-ana from An:
Segment B
The heavens are ours, the earth is ours: E-ana should be captured from An. After you have taken ......, listen to what I say to you. Examine ...... for me, you must observe these instructions: ...... the evil wind, the south wind, against me.’ approx. 23 lines missing
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
In this remarkable imprint the cow seems to be fighting with a number of opponents. One of them may be the evil wind and another one may be the south wind. Finally Inanna manages to conquer the E-ana, because in the shape of a cow she takes away this House on her back.



Number 11
Inanna embarked
Segment C of the 'An and Inanna' myth is also very fragmented and only mentions a few things that can be recognized in the above imprint, such as: ‘Holy Inanna embarked’, ‘The rope’ and ‘The fisherman’.
Segment C 1-4. 1 line fragmentary (Adagbir speaks:) ‘...... great net. ...... the flood. ...... the fisherman.’ 5-13. Holy Inanna embarked (?) on the ....... The barge ....... The rope ....... The south wind, that south wind, rose up. The evil wind, that evil wind, rose up. In the distant heavens ....... Ḫienḫisag ....... The fisherman ....... The reed thickets and the tall reeds ....... 14-18. Inanna spoke to Adagbir: ‘Youthful Utu ....... The barge .......’
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
Number 11
The rope Adagbir youth Utu the fisherman
In this imprint a man, situated below Inanna, holds a rope:
Segment C 1-4. 1 line fragmentary (Adagbir speaks:) ‘...... great net. ...... the flood. ...... the fisherman.’ 5-13. Holy Inanna embarked (?) on the ....... The barge ....... The rope ....... The south wind, that south wind, rose up. The evil wind, that evil wind, rose up. In the distant heavens ....... Ḫienḫisag ....... The fisherman ....... The reed thickets and the tall reeds ....... 14-18. Inanna spoke to Adagbir: ‘Youthful Utu ....... The barge .......’ 2 lines fragmentary and approx. 15 lines missing
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
In this segment two names are mentioned too: ‘Adagbir’ and ‘youthful Utu’.
o Youthful Utu must be the naked young fisherman standing in the barge at the right. o And thus Adagbir may be one who sits stirring the boat.



Number 11
Who lashes the water and makes an evil....
Segment D is also fragmentary and here we can also recognize a number of scenes: My lady, if you travel on the barge’, the seated Adagbir (?) may steer the boat and the fisherman (youthful Utu?) may lash the water (with his stick?) and makes an evil.... (the two snakes?):
Segment D
1-4. (Inanna speaks:) ‘I ....... ...... the way .......’ 2 lines fragmentary 5-12. Adagbir answered holy Inanna: ‘My lady, you cannot ....... Your divinity ....... The fisherman ...... the south wind. My lady, if you travel on the barge, and he raises the south wind, that south wind, and he raises the evil wind, that evil wind, barges and small boats will sink in the marshes.’ 13-15. Whenever (?) he approached the ...... with his great net, as (?) it came out of the flood, the swelling sea, it lashed the water and made an evil .......
16-19. Holy Inanna answered the fisherman: ‘If you are to find ...... E-ana ...... and I am to gaze in admiration ...... at that place, you said ...... the narrow passage.’ 20-22. Adagbir answered holy Inanna: ‘...... through the reed thickets and the tall reeds. For you ...... find E-ana, which comes forth from heaven.’ 23-25. Adagbir, ...... of Enlil, ...... through the reed thickets and the tall reeds. She gazed in admiration at E-ana which comes forth from heaven.

Number 5
In segment D Šul-a-zida grasped the cosmic tethering rope in his hands and in this imprint An's herdsman, holding ropes, seems to fight with Inanna:
Segment D 26-28. Šul-a-zida, An's herdsman, grasped the cosmic tethering rope in his hands. After he had
brought the ...... forth from the sky, he overcame the protective deities. He ...... and kept it below the horizon

Number 12
Then Inanna stamped the scorpion and cut off its tail:
Segment D
29-32. Having drunk cleansing water from the Ulaya river, Inanna stamped on the scorpion and cut off its tail. Like a lion it bellowed in an angry roar but its cries died down. ...... she threw it ...... and made it secure.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
The above imprint indeed depicts a scorpion without tail.



Number 13
In this imprint, the seated deity is holding something that may have been a piece of clay mentioned in the myth, which can be related to the idea of ‘creation’.
Segment D
33-38. Having heard its ...... cries, ...... poured forth the ......, the clay of creation, ...... and laid it ....... 2 lines missing ...... the great lady of heaven delivered those words to An.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
I don't think it's a cup because it's not mentioned in the myth, nor is there anything like a drinking festival, or is there any mention of a meal.
With this clay humans may have been created like in the myth ‘Enki and Ninmah’:
Enki and Ninmaḫ
At the word of his mother Namma, Enki rose up from his bed. In Ḫal-an-kug, his room for pondering, he slapped his thigh in annoyance. The wise and intelligent one, the prudent, ...... of skills, the fashioner of the design of everything brought to life birth-goddesses (?). Enki reached out his arm over them and turned his attention to them. And after Enki, the fashioner of designs by himself, had pondered the matter, he said to his mother Namma: ‘My mother, the creature you planned will really come into existence. Impose on him the work of carrying baskets. You should knead clay from the top of the abzu; the birth-goddesses (?) will nip off the clay and you shall bring the form into
existence. Let Ninmaḫ act as your assistant; and let Ninimma, Šu-zi-ana, Ninmada, Ninbarag, Ninmug, ...... and Ninguna stand by as you give birth. My mother, after you have decreed his fate, let Ninmaḫ impose on him the work of carrying baskets.’ (5 lines fragmentary)...... she placed it on grass and purified the birth.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
The following sentences of the ‘An and Inanna’ myth tell us that the days are getting shorter:
Segment D
39-45. Having heard those words, An slapped his thighs in ......, his voice filled with sighs of grief: ‘What has my child done? She has become greater than me! What has Inanna done? She has become greater than me! From now on, the normal length of daylight becomes shorter, and daylight
converts to night-time. From today, when the day's watch is three units long, daylight is equal to night-time.’ And now, when day began, it was indeed so.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
This is the case after the summer solstice on June 21. All in all this means that humans were created from clay on June 21. These humans were born about nine months later in Pleiades (so in the E-ana).



Number 8
In the myth it is said that the god of the sky created gods and humankind:
Segment D
46-55. An, who created gods and humankind, gazed at holy Inanna {(1 ms. adds:) and addressed the favourite wife who travels by his side}, unable to describe this arrogance, this arrogance -- An was unable to describe this arrogance, this arrogance: ‘My child, ...... you did not say ...... -- you were able to capture E-ana! Inanna, ...... you did not say ...... -- you were able to capture E-ana! Eana should be as firm as heaven, it should not be toppled. Its name should be 'The Settlement of the Land'.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
The sign behind him is called a 'star spade'. But as far as I'm concerned it symbolizes that An (heaven) above and his wife Ki (earth) below are united and engender a human. In this case they may engender the owner of the seal who is called 'Sheshshesh'. (But more on this later.)



Number 14
On this imprint the Inanna cow is next to An who is sitting on the throne. They are no longer facing each other, but here they look together at the two humans who approach them.
This scene may indicate that An addressed the favourite wife who travels by his side, and then mankind, all of the people, should prostrate themselves at her
46-55. An, who created gods and humankind, gazed at holy Inanna {(1 ms. adds:) and addressed the favourite wife who travels by his side}, unable to describe this arrogance, this arrogance -- An was unable to describe this arrogance, this arrogance: ‘My child, ...... you did not say ...... -- you were able to capture E-ana! Inanna, ...... you did not say ...... -- you were able to capture E-ana! Eana should be as firm as heaven, it should not be toppled. Its name should be 'The Settlement of the Land'. Mankind, all of the people, should prostrate themselves at her (?) feet.’ And now, under that sun and on that day, it was indeed so.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
Number 2
And in this imprint, which we have seen before, Inanna is sitting radiant on a throne (in Regulus, a star in Leo), it is clear that Inanna has attained her triumphant position:
56-60. She had captured E-ana from An! She secured it ....... Now Inanna speaks of the E-ana as the house that is the place of the lady. The goddess who has attained her triumphant
position, Inanna who has attained her triumphant position, declares in the good place: ‘I have captured E-ana from An.’ 61-62. Because you are unmatched among the Great Princes, maiden Inanna, praising you is magnificent!
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
This is the entire text excavated so far. It is obvious that it is not complete and we are therefore unfortunately unable to properly understand this text and the images on the seals.



The myth ‘An and Inanna’ and the constellations
Number 11
Taurus Orion Gemini Hydra Suen Dumuzid
As you see, I think that this imprint depict four constellations.
According to the next table the moon god Suen is the presiding deity of Gemini, and Dumuzid must be the presiding deity of Cancer/Hydra.

The sun passing through Pleiades and Taurus
Number 11
Taurus, Pleiades
At the left the winged gate is standing on the back of a cow and in the next sky map we see that the Pleiades are situated above Taurus. There clearly is a similarity.
Once again, from 'The Temple Hymns' it appears that the E-ana was built for the bull and that it has seven corners and seven fires, which means that this House is situated in the Pleiades. These constellation of seven stars are above Taurus and on all imprints we see that the temple gate is placed on the back of a cow. This indeed suggests that the E-ana is connected to Taurus as well as to the Pleiades.



The sun passing through Orion
Number 11
Šul-a-zida/Orion
The man with a rope in his hand is Šul-a-zida. He is called 'An's herdsman':
26-28. Šul-a-zida, An's herdsman, grasped the cosmic tethering rope in his hands. After he had
brought the ...... forth from the sky, he overcame the protective deities. He ...... and kept it below the horizon
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
In this myth Šul-a-zida, ‘An’s herdsman’, must be the god of the constellation Orion, which is called ‘The True Shepherd of Anu’ in Babylonia. The rope he is holding must be the Milky Way.
The Babylonian star catalogues of the Late Bronze Age name Orion MULSIPA.ZI.AN.NA, ‘The Heavenly Shepherd’ or ‘True Shepherd of Anu’ – Anu being the chief god of the heavenly realms.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)#Ancient_Near_East



The sun passes through Gemini
Number 11
Gemini
The table on page 15 shows that Suen is the presiding deity of Gemini which means that when the sun pass through constellation it conjunct to Suen, the god of the moon. In the imprint this is mythologically depicted by the sun god standing in the moon boat.
And as far as I'm concerned, Inanna, who calls herself a star, is the goddess of Sirius:
Dumuzid and Enkimdu
‘I am a woman and I won't do that, I won't! I am a star ......, and I won't! I won't be the wife of a shepherd!’ Her brother, the warrior youth Utu, said to holy Inanna:
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
The point is, that when the sun passes Gemini it also conjunct to Sirius, the bright star in the constellation Canis Major. So, with new moon in Gemini the sun, the moon and Sirius conjunct. And according to the next text at new moon the divine powers are perfected:
A cir-namursaja to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan When standing in the heavens she is the good wild cow of An, on earth she instils respect; she is the lady of all the lands. She received the divine powers in the abzu, in Eridug; her father Enki presented them to her. He placed the lordship and kingship in her hands. She takes her seat on the great dais with An; she determines the fates in her Land with Enlil. Monthly, at the new moon, the gods of the Land gather around her so that the divine powers are perfected. The great Anuna gods, having
bowed before them, stand there with prayers and supplications and utter prayers on behalf of all the lands. My lady decrees judgments in due order for the Land. Her black-headed people parade before her.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.



The sun passing through Cancer/Hydra
Number 11
Hydra
In the boat, the fisherman takes two copulating snakes out of the water.
These snakes are of course derived from the constellation Hydra because when the sun passes through Cancer it conjuncts Hydra at the same time. From the table on page 15 we can conclude that Dumuzid is the presiding deity of Cancer, and therefore also of Hydra. The point is, when the sun passes through Cancer and Hydra, all deities take the shape of one of these two constellations. That's why Utu turns Dumuzid's hands and feet into snakes:
Inanna's descent to the nether world
‘Utu, you are my brother-in-law, I am your sister's husband! I am he who carries food to E-ana, I am he who brought the wedding gifts to Unug, I am he who kisses the holy lips, I am he who dances on the holy knees, the knees of Inana. Please change my hands into {gazelle} {(1 ms. has instead:) snake} hands, change my feet into {gazelle} {(1 ms. has instead:) snake} feet, so I can escape to the house of Old Woman Belili.’ Utu accepted his tears. { (1 ms. adds 1 line:) Dumuzid's demons could not keep hold of him. } Utu
turned Dumuzid's hands into snake's hands. He turned his feet into snake's feet. Dumuzid escaped his demons. { (1 ms. adds 1 line:) Like a saĝkal snake he ....... } They seized ....... (2 lines fragmentary) Holy Inanna ...... her heart.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
On the imprint, Dumuzid not only shows the hands and feet of a snake, but he has become a snake all over. His wife Inanna has also turned into a snake: in a hymn she is even compared to a poisonous snake:
A hymn to Inana
...... and howling, strife, chaos, opposition, fighting and speeding carnage, ......, to know everything, to strengthen for the distant future a nest built ......, to instill fear in the ...... desert like a ...... poisonous snake, to subdue the hostile enemy, ...... and to hate ...... are yours, Inana.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.



The copulating snakes, of course, symbolize that Dumuzid and Inanna unite.
When deities unite, it is undoubtedly successful and Inanna produces offspring nine months later in Taurus. Inanna is therefore a Mother Goddess as she is also called in the following two text fragments.
A šir-namšub to Inana
In E-ana the linen-clad priests prepare an altar for him. Water is placed there for the lord; they address him. Bread is placed there; they address him. He is refreshed in the palace; they address him as follows: ‘Dumuzid, radiant in the temple (?) and on earth! Mother Inana, Mother Inana, your mounds, your mounds (?)! Mother Inana, Inana of heaven, your garments, your garments, your black garment, your white garment!’ (Inana (?) speaks:) ‘Oh my man who has come to the house: approach (?)!’ (The priests (?) speak:) ‘Bring forward a chant, a melody of the heart! Bring forward their ......, as they seat the ......! Approach their place, where they are stationing, where they are stationing, where they are stationing, where they are stationing Enlil in the Ki-ur!’

Inana, Mistress, supremely august, sparkling (?) in the heavens! Speaking kindly, extending your charms, ...... great mother goddesses, grant life to Rīm-Sîn.

This is another reason why the cow represents Inanna: in Taurus she gives birth to a child, probably the owner of the seal.



The winged gate seals were probably made from 2160 BC
Number 11
Two copulating snakes
The seals are believed to have been made between 2400 B.C. and 2200 B.C.. But it was customary for the Sacred Marriages to take place on June 21 and the two copulating serpents on this imprint indicate that it happened in the constellation Hydra. And the case is that Holy Marriages were not consummated in Hydra or Scorpio until after 2160 B.C. on June 21. The seals were therefore not made between 2400 B.C. and 2200 B.C., but from 2160 B.C.

A scorpion on a winged gate seal
Number 12
This imprint shows a scorpion and in the myth Inanna tramples it. Like on many other cylinder seals a scorpion represents Cancer:
‘The Crab, a variant of the Scorpion (Vide Vol. I. 60, 210), is frequently figured in a somewhat similar manner. It appears in Lajard, M. PI. xxxv. 7 (Sup. p. 32), and liii. 4. In PI. liii. 3 it is difficult to say whether two Crabs or Scorpions are intended. (As to the Crab in art, vide Z. sec. iv.)’
Researches into the origin of the primitive constellations of the Greeks, Phoenicians and Babylonians by Robert Brown, Jun., f.s.a.
So, this imprint shows a winged gate and a scorpion.
o The winged gate is the door of the E-ana, the House of Heaven situated in Pleiades, o And the scorpion represents the constellation Cancer.
Inanna is the goddess of Sirius, the brightest star in heaven:
o It is the evening star when the sun passes through Aries. o It conjunct to the sun from Pleiades to Cancer. o And when the sun passes Regulus (a star in Leo) it is the morning star.
Dumuzid is the presiding deity of Cancer, and when the sun passes this constellation it still conjunct to Sirius.
o This means that Dumuzid and Inanna, the goddess of Sirius, are united in the sun. o And thus they can celebrate a Sacred Marriage. o They may engender a child who may be born about nine months later in Taurus. o And in the shape of a cow Inanna may give birth to this child.



Number 3
It appears that Cancer is the seat of An, or Anu:
Description Given by Mul.Apin, Modern Identification by Hunger/Pingree mulAL.LUL [Alluttu] The Crab, the seat of dAnu, Cancer
http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-19.html
It is obvious that in the above imprint An, the god of heaven, sits on this seat, and now we may assume that he sits on Cancer.
Number 2
This imprint shows a lizard next to Inanna. This lizard represents Hydra in the first place:
Proverbs: collection A lizard follows like a snake, like a .......
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
As Dumuzid is the presiding deity of Cancer he is also the presiding deity of Hydra, the snake constellation. And in this imprint it seems that a lizard is depicted instead of a snake.
All in all: here Inanna sits on the seat of Anu (Cancer) while the lizard next to her represents Dumuzid. Together they may solemnize a Sacred Marriage. This Marriage of these deities of course is fruitful, and thus about nine months later Inanna, who has the shape of a cow, gives birth to a child, probably the owner of the seal.



About the so called ‘spades’
Number 8a
It is clear this imprint shows a so-called 'star spade' that cannot possibly be used as a spade. It really must be something else.
Number 8
No farmer will work with a star as a 'handle'. So it must have a completely different meaning.
o I think this star symbolizes An or Anu. o At the bottom of the so-called spade is a V-sign. This sign symbolizes a womb or a valley.
Now we can say the following: the husband of the god of the sky is the goddess of the earth, 'Uraš' (early Sumerian) or 'Ki' (later Sumerian), so:
o The An, the god of heaven, above. o And Uraš' or 'Ki' the goddesses of the earth is below. o The line between them symbolizes that they are connected and thus they are 'united'.



Number 15
Here is another so-called 'spade'.
o Above is the star of An or Anu, the god of heaven. o And below is the womb of ‘Uraš' or 'Ki', goddesses of the earth. o An and his spouse 'Uraš' or 'Ki' solomize a Sacred Marriage in Cancer. o About nine months later 'Uraš' or 'Ki' give birth to a child in the E-ana.
In ‘the House of Heaven’ children may be born like in the Keš temple countless people and kings are born. This temple is an important fierce bull (Taurus):
The Keš temple hymn
10-20. Nisaba was its decision-maker (?); with its words she wove it intricately like a net. Written on tablets it was held in her hands: House, platform of the Land, important fierce bull! House Keš, platform of the Land, important fierce bull! Growing as high as the hills, embracing the heavens, growing as high as E-kur, lifting its head among the mountains! Rooted in the abzu, verdant like the mountains! Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Ašgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintur?
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
It is founded by An:
31-43. House, great enclosure, reaching to the heavens, great, true house, reaching to the heavens! House, great crown reaching to the heavens, house, rainbow reaching to the heavens! House whose diadem extends into the midst of the heavens, whose foundations are fixed in the abzu, whose shade covers all lands! House founded by An, praised by Enlil, given an oracle by Mother Nintur! House Keš, green in its fruit! Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Ašgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintur?
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
And it gives birth to countless peoples, seed which has sprouts! It gives birth to kings,
58A-58Q. House ...... inspiring great awe, called with a mighty name by An; house ...... whose fate is grandly determined by the Great Mountain Enlil!

House, good ...... carrying in its hands the broad Land; house which gives birth to countless

The conjunction of the sun, the moon and Sirius
Number 11
Pleiades Hydra Inanna conjunct with the sun and with new moon also with the moon
As we saw before, this imprint depicts a crescent moon with a star underneath. Again, I think that Inanna is the goddess of Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, which conjuncts the sun from the Pleiades to Cancer/Hydra, so from March until June. Before March Inanna/Sirius is the evening star and after June she is the morning star.
The sun ‘activate’ Inanna/Sirius when traveling through the sky together, Inanna/Sirius wants to conquer heaven, earth as well as the E-anna.
Number 8
Cancer Gemini Taurus Pleiades Orion
Again, the sun and Sirius conjunct from Pleiades to Cancer.
o On this imprint the Pleiades are represented by the winged gate of the E-ana. o The cow is Inanna in Taurus o Šul-a-zida is the god of Orion o The crescent moon represents the moon god Suen. Because he is the presiding deity of Gemini, he represents this zodiac sign. o Cancer, which is called Anu's seat, is represented by Anu sitting on his seat.



Number 16
Cancer Gemini Taurus/Pleiades Orion
The crescent moon and the star symbolize that the sun, moon and Sirius are conjunct.
Number 17
Cancer Gemini Taurus/Pleiades Orion
In this imprint the Sirius star is even within the crescent symbolising that the sun, the moon and Sirius are conjunct.
All in all, in the so called ‘winged gate’ cylinder seals the sun and Sirius conjunct from Pleiades until the end of Cancer. This period is depicted on every seal with a winged gate.
o The winged gate represents the Pleiades. o The Inanna cow represents Taurus. o Šul-a-zida represents Orion o Together the crescent moon and the Sirius star represent Gemini. o The seat of An represents Cancer.
And in the above imprint Inanna sits on this heavenly seat as a victor.

Number 7 Abb. 435: Nach Delaporte 1910, Tf. VIII, Abb. 77; nach Porada 1934: Serpentin, 28 x 17 mm. Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris. „Auf der rechten Seite der ‚geflügelten Tür‘ kommt von rückwärts ein Seil heraus, das von einer bärtigen ..., nackten Figur mit beiden Händen gefasst wird. Der Mann hat den Kopf nach rückwärts gewandt.’
Christian nahm das „Tor’ als hinter dem Rind stehend wahr, während es für Weber auf dem Rind steht. Diese abweichende perspektivische Einordnung des Bildes folgt einem von Rudolph Arnheim beschriebenen Akt des Sehens, nach welchem Überschneidungen von Linien und Flächen den Eindruck von Vorder- und Hintergrund erwecken (Arnheim 1978, 242-245). Tatsächlich fehlt dem „Tor’ auf dem Siegelbild (Abb. 435 im Artikel von Erika Bleibtreu) eine untere Begrenzung, und seine rechten Seitenbalken sind über oder hinter der Wölbung des Rinderrückens länger nach unten gezogen als die linken. Christian sieht das unvollständige, abgeschnittene Bild des „Tores’ so, dass der Gegenstand sich hinter dem ganz gezeichneten Rind befindet und für den Beschauer teilweise von dessen Rumpf verdeckt wird. Meist vernachlässigt man jedoch in der Wahrnehmung die unvollständige Abbildung des Gegenstandes und sieht es als auf dem Rücken des Tieres befestigt.

Number 17 Seal number 35a This is an Akkadian seal. (Shell 3,1 cm) In the Akkadian period the first complex mythological scenes appear on cylinder seals. On this seal two gods are holding a bull in front of a winged gate. The ‘winged gate’ group is a well-known Akkadian group. See picture with a reference seal from Tell Asmar. (bottom right side) Boehmer (see bibliography) dates this group mainly to his Akkadian III period beginning with the reign of Naramsin and ending with the fall of the Akkadian empire
