Aryans did not invade India or destroy the Indus Valley
Civilisation -- Shree Vinekar et al (2022)
Shree Vinekar, April 26, 2022:
You are absolutely correct, Ajit. The entire massive literature on "Aryan" "race" is a big humbug. There is no need to waste time on this. The problem is the misguided "racists" do not want to accept that there was a rich culture indigenous to this region called Harappan or Saraswati-Sindhu region. The new migrants to India, the British and all the Europeans, had their own unresolved identity issues and confusion of chronology with the brain washing of non-scientific Biblical chronology which they could not reconcile. They had to let their fantasies loose to create a bogus reality under elaborately complex scholarship which all cultures in the world were trapped into for centuries. Hitler too got caught up in it because of his own (or hid peoples') identity issues. It was one hell of an irrational "superiority complex" related debate that is still prevalent and gets dignified as as a "controversial" intellectual domain. The human Unconscious drives attached to this need for superiority works in mysterious ways in all the proponents of this "Aryan" race and "Aryan" superior culturedebate. Even Indians have their own inferiority and superiority complexes tied to this identity debate. Mahabharata shows that Afghanistan was Gandhara and the old Bharatvarsha extended far beyond thaton the west beyond current Pakistan into Iran. There were onland and maritime travels and intercourse with trade and exchange of knowledge for 10 to 25 thousand years. The culture in Sindhu-saraswati region was highly industrious and developed with very high metallurgic skills. Dr. Kalyanaraman has done extensive research of this. Initially the entire house of cards of Aryan theory was built on linguistic derivatives. Since then a lot of energy is spent to justify the bogus fantasies of the European immigrants to India with their own identity confusion and need to establish their superiority. Everything boils down to the Euro-centric thinking. All of these histories are somebodies fantasies couched as scientific, linguistic and even genetic facades. Like you say the word Arya has no racist connotation whatsoever.

So, regardless of whether they destroyed or did not, at least we are to accept that the so-called "Aaryans" ACTUALLY existed as A RACE, that they ACTUALLY came (peacefully) from outside Bhaarat?
Personally, I would FULLY REJECT that simply because of the word "Aarya" which means, in Sanskrut, 'an Aarya' is someone who is spiritually advanced human being". It has NOTHING to do the physique, color or any other bodily appearance.

It is tragic that history books say that the Aryans invaded India and destroyed the Indus
Valley Civilization. They were not kings or military commanders. They had neither an army
nor weapons. They were priests, traders and people engaged in other urban occupations in
Iran, fleeing in the face of religious persecution. They travelled in Indian trade ships and were
brought to Indian cities by Indian traders and sailors. Not only was their coming not an
invasion, even the migration was not without the consent of the people of the Sapt Sindhu.
The towns and cities of Sapt Sindhu were very well-administered. This is evident from how
they were maintained for such a long time. It would not have been possible for anyone to
come and settle down without the consent of the government in such well-administered units
and there is evidence to show that the Indo-Aryans, on arrival in India, settled down in the
cities only.
The circumstances in which these Aryans came to India show that they were aware that they
would be welcome. For them, fleeing from Iran was a compulsion, but coming to India was a
choice, as they had several options before them. They could have gone to Turan, where
Ajashrava was the king and patron of people of their religion. He continued to rule for several
decades after the war with Vistasp as he is reported to have killed Zoroaster when the latter
was seventy-seven years old. They could have gone to Egypt, which was a flourishing
civilization and was closer. They could have gone to Greece, where some of them had gone.
Amongst these options, which were easier, they chose Sapt Sindhu, a choice that reveals that
they felt that it was the best for them. Evidently, they were in contact with a few prominent
traders from India who welcomed their coming and offered assistance. It is only in this
scenario that they could have settled down in the towns and cities of the Sapt Sindhu.



1. Who, Agni, among your (followers) are the imprisoners of foes who among them
are the protectors (of men) the splendid distributors of gifts. Who among them
defend the assertion of untruth? Who are the encouragers of evil deeds?
2. These your friend, Agni, everywhere dispersed, were formerly unhappy, but are
again fortunate. May they who, with (censorious) words, impute fraudulent
(practices) to me, who pursues a straight path, bring evil upon themselves.
(Rig Ved. M-5, S-12, R-4 and 5)
These Richas are ascribed to Rishi Sutambhar Aitarey. Evidently, he is a first-generation
migrant. He has seen Iran and has gone through the turbulent times. In the first Richa he is
speaking of the two sides. On one side are those who imprison their foes and protect fellow
beings and on the other are those who defend the assertion of untruth and encourage evil
deeds. The Rishi is remembering the bad days that are over. The second is significant. It
shows that the Indo-Aryans on arrival were dispersed. This indicates that the settlement of the
arriving population had been managed by the administrative machinery of the towns and
cities of Sapt Sindhu. The entire population concentrating in one place would have made the
municipal services collapse and cause difficulties. They spread the people over the place to
ensure that no single town or city gets over burdened with the additional population. This, not
only speaks of the efficiency of the governance of Sapt Sindhu, but also shows that they had
accepted and assimilated the new population from the very beginning.
The arriving population being dispersed also goes to prove that they were not invaders. In an
invasion, the invaders are unsure of their position and feel the threat of being attacked by the
local population, to counter which they stick together and often make protective structures for
themselves, like forts. The Aryan population felt no such necessity and was secure even
though dispersed.
The Richa proceeds to say that they were formerly unhappy, but are fortunate again, an
indication that the Rishi who composed it had himself come to Sapt Sindhu and was not a
descendant of one of the migrants. As he is remembering the earlier unhappy times and is
grateful to be fortunate again, it is not a situation in which refugees fleeing Iran had somehow
found a place to survive, but a situation in which the host has made an effort to make them
comfortable. The Richa concludes with the Rishi cursing the people who had censured him
and had imputed fraudulent practices to him. This reveals the identity of the people because
of whom these friends of Agni were formerly unhappy.



Apart from these Richas which directly speak of what the Indo-Aryans received on arrival,
there are several passages in the Veds which show that they were living with the Harappan
people. In some of them they appear to be in their cities. A few such passages are given here.
1. I repeat with a (willing) mind, the unreluctant praises of Bhavya, dwelling on the
banks of the Sindhu, a prince of unequalled (might), desirous of renown, who has
enabled me to celebrate a thousand sacrifices.
2. From which generous prince, soliciting (my acceptance), I Kakshivat,
unhesitatingly accepted a hundred nishkas, a hundred vigorous steeds, a thousand
bulls, whereby he has spread his imperishable fame through heaven.
3. Ten chariots drawn by baysteeds and carrying my wives stood near me, given to
me by Svanay and a thousand and sixty cows followed. These, after a short
interval of time, did Kakshivat, deliver (to his father).
