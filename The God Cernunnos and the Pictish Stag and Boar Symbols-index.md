The God Cernunnos and the Pictish Stag and Boar Symbols (Part 1)
If we continue with the proposition that Pictish symbols represent
stars or constellations in the night sky (and therefore are part of an
astrological system) we could ask: are there long-forgotten Pictish
‘boarʼ and ‘stagʼ constellations?
Could these hypothetical constellations have occupied a portion of
the night sky in the neighbourhood of Ophiuchus, Scorpio, and
Libra?
This region may well have included long forgotten stag and boar
constellations, with only echoes of their existence surviving in Greek
and Celtic mythology. The hunting panel on the Shandwick stone
may well be the means to confirm this possibility. (See post on the
Shandwick Stone below)

At first a casual examination of the constellation of Ophiuchus gives
us no obvious clues to there being any stag or wild boar connection.
This classical constellation is large and represents a celestial human
figure normally depicted holding two snakes. The snakes are
sometimes classed as the separate constellation of Serpens, and
this can be further divided into a right and left portion. Ophiuchus
has in the past been associated with Aesculapius, the surgeon on
Jasonʼs ship the Argo. A clue however from one of Europeʼs finest
archaeological treasures, may provide a link between the stag, the
boar, and the constellation Ophiuchus. This Greek mythological
figure with his serpents is strangely enough reminiscent of a figure



that apparently featured in Celtic religious belief. This god, known as
‘Cernunnosʼ, whose name according to Miranda Green in her
Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend means ‘horned or peaked oneʼ,
is depicted usually with antlers on his head, and sometimes with the
ears of a stag. He often holds a snake or ram-horned snake. He is
seated in a lotus or cross-legged pose reminiscent of the gods from
the Indian subcontinent. His most famous image is the one that
appears on the Gundestrup Cauldron found in Denmark. This
cauldron is generally thought to be Celtic (although may have been
custom manufactured in Thrace) and probably dates from the first
century BC. Cernunnos is shown holding in his left hand a large
snake, and in his right a torc. He has a large pair of antlers on his
head and is surrounded by beasts, with significantly for us, a stag to
his right and an animal that is usually interpreted as a boar to his left.
As pointed out by Gregory Coulter in The Lost Zodiac of the Druids,
the snake-holding Ophiuchus seems therefore to have some
parallels with the various images of Cernunnos, and it would be
tempting to speculate on whether the two figures have long
forgotten connections or perhaps a common origin. Cernunnosʼ
identification as a human figure with stag-like physical features, and
a strong association with animals, fits well with the concept that in
Celtic tradition there are frequently found gods or heroes who can
‘shape-shiftʼ. As Miranda Green states in the context of Cernunnos
and his stag association ‘perhaps one of those beings who
underwent transmogrification or shape-shifting from human to
animal formʼ. Furthermore, Cernunnos would seem to make a
reasonable candidate for the animal interpreter who features in the
old Welsh story of Culhwch and Olwen; ‘Gwrhyrʼ. We should note the
close proximity that Ophiuchus has animal constellations that may
bear some relationship to the creatures that Gwrhyr conversed with
(see book for more details). Indeed, who better to talk to the animals
than a Cernunnos/Ophiuchus character?



The Constellation ‘Ophiuchusʼ note proximity to the ecliptic and
position relative to Scorpio

In the The Lost Zodiac of the Druids, Gregory Clouter investigated
the complex imagery of the Gundestrup Cauldron, theorising that the



figures are cosmological. One of his conclusions was that the figure
of Cernunnos is indeed the constellation Ophiuchus in the night sky.
He also interprets the animal to the right of Cernunnos as a hound
and equates this to the constellation Libra. The evidence presented
in my own book however would tend to suggest that Libra is one of
the candidates for a wild boar and this is the more common
interpretation of the animal figure that appears beside Cernunnos on
the cauldron.
However imaginatively we view the asterism corresponding to
Ophiuchus, and try to match this to Cernunnos, the evidence so far
presented is still relatively weak for a positive identification of this
constellation as the stag, or wild boar, that feature in the collection of
early medieval Welsh stories – The Mabinogion. If the god
Cernunnos could be associated with the constellation Ophiuchus,
then another possibility is that a Celtic ‘Cernunnosʼ constellation
might have been formed by combining the constellations Ophiuchus
and its smaller close neighbour, Scorpio. In this scenario the much
larger constellation would represent the god, but at the same time
half of the constellation could also be seen as having some of the
attributes of a stag. This might provide an explanation for the godʼs
shape shifting abilities and also explain the symbolism of Cernunnos
on the Gundestrup Cauldron. As Ophiuchus lies to the north of the
ecliptic and Scorpio predominately to the south of the ecliptic, this
possible split zodiacal sign would be important when considering the
paths of the Moon and planets through this region of the sky. The
Moon in particular ‘wandersʼ considerably from the ecliptic and
would therefore sometimes pass through Scorpio (i.e. below the
ecliptic), perhaps emphasising a cervine aspect, while at other times
pass through Ophiuchus (i.e. above the ecliptic) and therefore
emphasising a more human-like aspect. It is also worth noting that
Ophiuchus is sometimes considered as a thirteenth zodiacal



constellation, but is the only one which is not recognised as an
astrological sign. Indeed, the Sun spends a longer time traversing
Ophiuchus than it does neighbouring Scorpio.
Turning now to Scorpio, how likely are we to find associations with
stags or deer? Scorpio, according to classical legend, is the creature
that slew the giant Orion, but was itself in fear of the arrow of
Sagittarius. Using an arrow to kill a scorpion would seem to be a little
strange, but might just hint at the possibility that Sagittarius may not
have always been aiming at a diminutive scorpion. Perhaps the
constellation once represented a larger creature, one more suitable
for a hunter. The month of October, traditionally the month
associated in the classical world with Scorpio, is known in Scots
Gaelic as Damhair, derived from the word damh meaning ‘stagʼ.
Generally, it is thought that the name relates to the stag-rut that
occurs in the Highlands in the autumn, but it is not beyond the
realms of possibility that the name is in some way connected with an
alternative cervine Scorpio. Even if there is not a connection
between Damhair and an ancient European view of the constellation
Scorpio, the Gaelic name for the month provides some potential
reasons as to why northern Europeans may have seen Scorpio as a
stag. The October stag rut is of course the time when the animal is at
his most potent and magnificent. This in itself could have inspired
the notion of a stag constellation exulted by the Sun in autumn. If
there is evidence that the Picts included a stag within their own
zodiac, it would be tempting to suggest that the Gaelic month of
Damhair in some way reflects this. It is worth noting that in the
closely related Irish language the name for October is different. For
now there is simply not enough evidence to connect the Gaelic name
for October with an ancient version of the constellation Scorpio,
which would also necessitate evidence of continuity from the Picts to
the later Gaelic speaking population of the Highlands. It is also the



case that rare white stags are seen as a symbol of good luck in
Scotland and are viewed as ‘otherworldlyʼ, hence it is considered
almost taboo to hunt them. Could the white stag be linked to the
concept of a celestial deer constellation? According to the Oxford
Dictionary of Mythology, a stag enticed people into the ‘otherworldʼ;
an idea that was later Christianised with the animal being thought of
as guiding souls to heaven. Perhaps this also suggests that the stag
was seen in a celestial or cosmological role, acting as an
intermediary between earth and heaven.

(Painting: “The Monarch of the Glen” by Sir Edwin Landseer)
Another important reason why northern Europeans may not have
recognised Scorpio as a Scorpion is that the stars of Scorpio, even at
their zenith, do not rise much above the northern horizon. Indeed,
the Scorpionʼs tale and sting are simply not visible at northern
latitudes. This second point would have a natural effect on the
overall impression the asterism would have on the eye. It seems
reasonable therefore that northern Europeans may have viewed this
particular constellation as something else, with the possibility of a
stag substituting for the scorpion.
Turning to a map of the night sky, it is worthwhile considering the
shape of the northern, visible portion, of the constellation Scorpio.
This portion, and indeed the whole of the constellation, is dominated
by the red giant; Antares. This is viewed traditionally as the
scorpionʼs heart. Above this is a small group of bright stars that
define the scorpionʼs head. Extending further northwards from these
are the scorpionʼs ‘clawsʼ. If northern Europeans really envisaged
Scorpio as a stag, then does such an interpretation make sense in
terms of the shape of the constellation? Assuming that the stag was
seen as upright, as these figures usually are, then the obvious first
characteristic to look for is the stagʼs antlers. It is not at all difficult to
imagine the pincers of the scorpion being viewed by northern
Europeans as the antlers of the more familiar stag. The head of the
scorpion would also fit well with the shape of the stagʼs head. The
red star Antares may therefore have been viewed not as the
scorpionʼs heart, but rather as that of a stag.
We should also not forget Herculesʼ third task, that of the Ceryneian
hind, and the strong Greek association of the hind or stag with the
constellation Scorpio. Is this further evidence that this constellation
may have been viewed by at least some Europeans as a ‘stagʼ or at

least a stag constellation existed in this area of the sky.

The God Cernunnos and the Pictish Stag and Boar Symbols (Part 2)
Part 2
In the these two articles , we are exploring the possibility that the
Picts, and other cultures across Europe and perhaps beyond,
recognised ‘Boarʼ and ‘Stagʼ constellations in the night sky.
The ‘Hunting Panelʼ from the Pictish ‘Shandwick Stoneʼ , Note the
Stag being fired on by the hunter, bottom right, the twin warriors,
bottom left, and the wild boar above and to the left of the hunter and
stag.
There is further evidence for Scorpio being seen originally as a stag
outside of the Mediterranean basin, this time surprisingly in the



ancient Indian astrological system; the ‘Vedicʼ system. In this eastern
zodiac, with its twenty-seven lunar zodiac signs or ‘nakshatrasʼ, the
constellation Scorpio is divided into three of these ‘lunar mansionsʼ.
These are Vishakha, Anuradha, and Jyeshta. Anuradha is symbolized
principally by a lotus flower, but has as its ‘animal symbolʼ a female
deer, the Mgira. Furthermore, Jyeshta with its principal star Antares
(the alpha star of Scorpio), has as its animal symbol the stag.
Perhaps this also tantalisingly hints at a long lost stag constellation,
although this time not in Europe but in India. It may at first seem
unlikely that there could be a cultural connection between northern
Europe and India, but it is important to remember that the languages
of North India, and those of Europe, are thought to have a common
linguistic ancestor; proto-Indo-European. It is therefore perfectly
possible that there are other ancient cultural connections.
There is also a fragment of fascinating evidence from a traditional
German ʼfolkʼ rhyme. There is little information as to how old this
poem is or anything else on its origins, but it apparently describes an
alternative zodiac or at least a sequence of stars or constellations
associated with the changing seasons:
‘Eber, Riese, Himmelskuh zählen wir dem Winter zu.
Hase, Wolf und Menschenpaar stellen uns den Frühling dar.
In Hahn und Hengst und Ährenfrau die Sommersonne steht genau.
Schwalbe, Hirsch und Bogenschütz sind des Herbstes feste Stütz.ʼ
This has been translated into English as:
‘Boar, giant, and celestial cow we count to the winter.
Hare, wolf and human pair represent the spring.
At rooster, stallion and corn-ear-woman is summer solstice.
Swallow, deer (stag) and archer are the frame of autumn.ʼ
From the above text, which is clearly referring to the night sky, only



the human pair (Gemini), the corn-ear-woman (Virgo), and the archer
(Sagittarius) are obviously discernible, although the celestial cow
may represent Taurus. But noticeably within the sequence we have
the appearance of a stag and a wild boar; the stag is associated with
the autumn, as Scorpio is, whilst the boar is associated with the
winter. In addition, the stag appears in the poem alongside the
archer – remembering that Scorpio and Sagittarius are side by side in
the Graeco-Roman Zodiac. This perhaps may hint at alternative
northern European constellations including a stag and a wild boar;
some of these may even be zodiacal.
Outside Pictland but within the British Isles there is another possible
example of an alternative northern European view of this same area
of the night sky, and specifically the area around Ophiuchus. The so
called ‘Parwich Tympanumʼ is a pre-Norman, Anglo-Saxon stone
carved arch from the Church in the village of Parwich in Derbyshire.

http://www.parwichhistory.org/Issue%202.htm
This is thought to have been carved in the eleventh century or
perhaps much earlier. While there are clearly elements of Christian
symbolism within the scene depicted on the stone arch, the mix of
animals seems puzzling. Interestingly in the scene there is a deer or
stag with a wild boar placed above it. In addition there is a pair of
serpents, a rather indeterminate bird that sports talons, what
appears to be a horse carrying a cross and is therefore usually
interpreted as ‘the lamb of godʼ, and a beast that has been
interpreted as a wolf. Examining the area of the night sky around
Scorpio, our candidate Pictish stag constellation, we have the
adjacent constellations of Ophiuchus and Libra, which represents
our principal candidate for a wild boar constellation. Ophiuchus is of
course in Greek mythology the serpent holder, and as mentioned



previously, there is the possibility that this constellation may have
been visualised by Celts as a stag god, perhaps shape-shifting
(identified popularly today as Cernunnos). In the same area of sky,
close to Ophiuchusʼ serpent, we have Aquila the eagle. Sitting
directly below Scorpio is the constellation Lupus. This has been
interpreted by different cultures as a wolf or other beast such as a
lioness or leopard. Finally to the east of Aquila, the eagle, we have
two horses. Firstly the small constellation of Equuleus, the foal, seen
by some classical authors as a horse head, and secondly, further
east; Pegasus the flying horse. The mix on the Parwich Tympanum
would seem to a reasonably good match for the area around
Ophiuchus, but once again the match is dependent on accepting the
presence of a wild boar and a stag in that region of the sky. Why the
‘lamb of godʼ would have been depicted as a horse or foal is unclear,
but might be explained if Church authorities had attempted to
Christianise pagan constellations. In this case perhaps they may
have tried to persuade people to view Equuleus, the foal as the ‘lamb
of godʼ, with the sculptor compromising on this new interpretation by
carving a partly traditional version.
Further echoes from ancient cultures in Europe and Asia may also
have resonance with the Shandwick stone. Many cultures including
for example, Hungarian and Persian, have similar stories describing
a hunter, sometimes twin hunters, or brothers perpetually chasing
after a stag in much the same way as Hercules. This stag is no
ordinary stag, but is white and holds the Sun in his antlers (The
Legend of the White Stag). This chase story might have arisen as a
result of the relationship in the night sky between Gemini and
Scorpio. At the autumnal equinox, the Sun is in Scorpio, between the
‘pincersʼ or in our theoretical alternative version, the ‘antlersʼ. As the
Sun sets in Scorpio due west, Gemini rises in the east, and is present
in the sky until the dawn Therefore the two constellations in effect

are on opposite sides of the sky and appear to ‘chaseʼ each other,
with neither ever being able to catch up with the other. The
Shandwick stone, whether intentionally or not shows this exact same
relationship, with twin warriors (perhaps representing Gemini?) in the
bottom left hand corner and a stag in the bottom right hand corner
(being shot at by a hunter with bow).
It would therefore seem that there are various strands of evidence
coming together from Europe and Asia that collectively suggest that
there was once a ‘stagʼ constellation, in the vicinity of the classical
constellation of Scorpio. This is most likely to correspond to Scorpio
itself. What is astonishing is that from several very disparate sources;
various European traditions, a Pictish stone, Welsh mythology, Vedic
astrology, Greek mythology, a German poem, and an Anglo-Saxon
carved arch, we find the same pattern repeating itself. The possibility
that the Picts also visualised a Boar and Stag constellations within
the vicinity of Ophiuchus would therefore seem to be plausible.
