earth: so that He rewards those who do evil, according to their
deeds, and He rewards those who do good, with what is best.

YUSUFALI: Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, only

who wardeth off (evil).

indecencies but the passing idea; surely your Lord is liberal in

who guards (against evil).
