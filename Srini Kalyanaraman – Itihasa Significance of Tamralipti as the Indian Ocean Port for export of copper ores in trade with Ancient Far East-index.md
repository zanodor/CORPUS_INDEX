Itihāsa. Significance of Tamralipti as the Indian Ocean Port for export of copper ores in trade with Ancient Far East
-- Jaina seuṛā 'Jaina devotees' are saraka 'Jaina householders' who initiated mining operations in Singhbhum District in 1st millennium BCE
This is an addendum to:
Itihāsa. A tribute to Jaina seuṛā 'Jaina devotees' of Singhbhum District, Bengal who made Bharat the richest nation on the globe in 1 CE https://tinyurl.com/ybvt8xt4 In this reference, it was suggested that the word 'seraka' mentioned in Mr. Mallet's report signifies: Jaina seuṛā 'Jaina devotees' of Singhbhum District, Bengal, initiated mining work & powered the Tin-Bronze Revolution of Eurasia. Jaina devotees are the initiators of early mining in Bharat (seuṛā m. ʻ a Jain mendicant ʼ(Punjabi); sevṛɔ m. ʻ a Jain monk ʼ,  ̊ṛī f. (Gujarati)(CDIAL 13592). seuṛā are distinct artisan group (engaged in irrigation -- Pk. siṁcaï; P. siñjṇā ʻ to water, irrigate ʼ(CDIAL 13394) in the Jaina community.
A variant spelling is used in some geological reports for the word seraka: e.g., sarāka as miners. But, both the words seraka and sarāka are cognate with Śrāvaka, 'Jaina laity or householder' (as distinct from an ascetic who is arhant).
A further amplification for the etymology of the word 'seraka' is provided by evidence from Jaina community in Singhbhum District and a group of people called 'saraka' in Purulia, Bankura and Burdwan district of West Bengal and Ranchi, Dumka and Giridih districts and Singhbhum region of Jharkhand. The Saraks belonging to most of Jharkhand and West Bengal are Bengali speakers while those living in historical Singhbhum region speak Singhbhumi Odia.
Vajjabhumi of Saraks or সরাক, Śrāvaka, ଶ୍ରାବକ — Ṡrabaka
The Saraks (Bengali: সরাক) (from Sanskrit Śrāvaka) is a community in Jharkhand, Bihar, Bengal, and Orissa . They have been followers of some aspects of Jainism, such as vegetarianism, since ancient times, however were isolated and separated from the main body of the Jain community in western, northern and southern India and have been Hindu Bengalis ever since. The Saraks are an ancient community in Jharkhand and Bengal. British anthropologist Edward Tuite Dalton noted that according to the Bhumij tradition in Singhbhum district, the Saraks were early settlers in the region. According to Santosh Kumar Kundu, the Saraks arrived from the northwestern region of India, presently in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. This conjecture is reasonable, considering the fact that Khetri mines of Northwest India constituted the principal source of copper for powering the Tin-Bronze Revolution from 4th millennium BCE. It is quite likely, that the Saraks of this vajjabhumi (diamond region) migrated from Khetri mines and carried their traditional skills of mining into this newly settled region, in ca. 1st millennium BCE.
Saraks started mining of Copper ore for the first time in Singhbhum Shear Zone which is now famous for mining of precious metals such as Copper, Gold, Silver and Uranium.

The Saraks of Ruam are masters in the art of smelting of copper. It is also evident that famous ancient port of Tamralipta owes its name to the copper mined and processed in the Sarak country of Ruam which was exported to the South East Asian kingdoms in a large scale.
Location of Tamralipti (called Tamluk today), a port on Bay of Bengal (Indian Ocean). "It is believed that Tamralipti was the exit point of the Mauryan trade route for the south and south-east. Excavations at Moghalmari confirmed the presence of Buddhist vihars in the area which was mentioned by Chinese travelers Fa Hien and Xuanzang. It was located near Rupnarayana river. This place has been mentioned in Mahabharata as a place which Bhima acquired. It was linked by roads with the major towns of that time,i.e. Rajagriha, Shravasti, Pataliputra, Varanasi, Champa, Kausambi and Taxila." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamralipta cf.

The region is called Vajjabhumi in ancient texts because diamonds were once mined in the region. A group of Saraks from northern parts of Purulia district migrated to the Subarnarekha valley and established a small state by the name Ruam. There is a village existing by the same name in Musabani Block of East Singhbhum district very close the Uranium town of Jaduguda.
According to Ramesh Chandra Majumder, the Jain scholar Bhadrabahu, the second Louhacharya and the author of Kalpa Sutra may have come from the Sarak community.(Kundu, Santosh

(Pali) In Jaina tradition, the word Śrāvaka or Sāvaga (from Jain Prakrit) is used to refer the Jain laity (householder). According to the Jain text Puruşārthasiddhyupāya: Ascetics who establish themselves in pure and absolute consciousness observe complete abstinence. Those who practice the path of partial abstinence are called Śrāvaka.
Puruşārthasiddhyupāya (41). In Jainism, both ascetics and householders have to follow five vows (vratas) compulsorily. These five vows are: 1. Ahiṃsā – Not to hurt any living being by actions and thoughts. Out of the five types of living beings, a householder is forbidden to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch). 2. Satya – to lie or speak what is not commendable 3. Asteya – Not to take anything if not given 4. Brahmacharya (Chastity) – Refraining from indulgence in sex-passion 5. Aparigraha (Non-possession) Detachment from material property. One who observes the small vows is a householder Tattvartha Sutra (101)(Jain, Vijay K. (2012), Acharya Amritchandra's Purushartha Siddhyupaya: Realization of the Pure Self, With Hindi and English Translation, Vikalp Printers, p.xiii; p.32; p.101). The tirthankara restores or organises the sangha, a fourfold order of muni (male monastics), aryika (female monastics), śrāvakas (male followers) and śrāvikās (female followers).(Balcerowicz, Piotr (2009), Jainism and the definition of religion (1st ed.), Mumbai: Hindi Granth Karyalay, p.17)
