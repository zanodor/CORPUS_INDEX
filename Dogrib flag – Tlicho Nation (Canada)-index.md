Flag
A dark blue flag with thin centered horizontal white wavy stripe overlapping the bottom of a yellow sun disc with background-color fimbriation showing where these meet and four red teepees with white fimbriation and poles set in a row on the bottom half; yellow upright five-pointed star on the upper fly. (Note that the sun disc is incomplete, for its "south pole" is not showing below the wavy stripe which it would if complete.) António Martins-Tuválkin, 22 June 2006
And some significant flag information, adapted from the first person narrative on the site:
The flag designed by James WahShee. The colors and symbols represent:
- Royal blue - sub-arctic Tlicho Nation territory - four tepees - the four Tlicho communities which form the Tlicho nation, government and assembly. - sun and river represent the words of Chief Monfwi who signed Treaty 11 (1921). "He said that as long as the sun rises and sets and the river flows forward and not backward the Tlicho People will honour the Treaty" - the North Star represents direction and a new era for the Tlicho Nation, which moves united into the future.
Phil Nelson, 29 April 2006
