Thus, the later-day holder of the professional calling card (a possible descendant from the days of Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization) proclaims himself as Majhitha tāḍagha 'Boatman, textile dyer, smith or goldsmith'. The semantics of tāḍa—gha 'goldsmith' are consistent with the image on the chest of the one-horned young bull with forward-thrusting, spiny horn which is read rebus in Meluhha as singhin rebus: singi 'ornament gold'. ताड tāḍa-घः , -घातः an artificer who beats or hammers, a smith (Apte)

"The earliest historical reference to the hill comes from Kalhana. He called the mountain Gopadri. Kalhana says that King Gopaditya granted the land at the foot of the hill to the Brahmins that had come from the "Araya versh." The land grant was called "GOPA AGRAHARAS". This area is now called Gupkar. Kalhana mentions another village in the
vicinity of the hill. King Gopaditya housed some of the Brahmins to a village next door.
Kalhana names this village as Bhuksiravatika (Buch’vore today). Kalhana also mentions that
King Gopaditya built the temple on the top of the hill as a shrine to Jyesthesvara (Shiva Jyestharuda) around 371 BCE."

I submit that linguistic studies related to Bhāratīya sprachbund, 'speech union' or 'linguistic
area' will provide for a reconstruction of the spoken forms of Meluhha, Mleccha recorded in Indus Script Corpora as wealth-accounting ledgers. For Pāṇini those who mispronounce Samsk ̥rtam expressions are Mleccha (cognate Meluhha--Akkadian, Milakkhu-- Pali).
[quote]Who are the Asuras? The Asuras are said to have been incompetent in articulation of vowels and consonants accurately. The Satapatha Brahmana takes care of the proper articulation of samskrta (Vedic) consonants and vowels. For instance, they failed to articulate the araya (h), correctly; 'helava helava' they-uttered (te 'asura attavacasa he 'alava he' 'alava 3.2.1.23). The Madhyandina-branch of the Satapathi Brahmins were occasionally indifferent to correct articulation; so that they got corrupt recitation as the mlecchas did.Mleccha were those who could not pronounce Samskrta (vak) appropriately as prescribed in the Svarabidhana of the grammatical treatises. Mostly the mlecchas were the Kirata, the Savara, the Pulinda (Amarakosa, Sudravarga). Linguistically, Samskrta bhasa is regarded as an offshoot of the Indo-European Speech Family. The Iranian speeches are considered as the sister Family of the Indo-Aryan Speech. It suggests that the Iranian language has got affinity with Vedic Sanskrit. Among the scholars who hold that the Aryans had their early home in the region of Bulk (Bactria) and Sogdiana in vicinity of Bokhara on the bank of Oxus (vaksu) river acknowledge that two courses of spoken language developed in India and Iran though closely to one another.
(i) The Indian group refers to the Vedic speech together with ancient Prakrits, which were endeavoured by Panini (400 A.D.) for refinement. Those speeches are broadly named the Old Indo-Aryan (OIA) languages with their subsequent development in the Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) i.e. Pali, Jaina Prakrit (Ardha Magadhi) and important branches of Prakrita like Maharastri, Sauraseni, Magadhi. Again those are changed into the speeches of Apabhramsa, and, thereafter 'bhasa' like Hindi, Assamese, Oriya, Bengali, Gujrati, Marathi, etc. (ii) The Iranian Zend (or Zand) referes to its specimens available in the Avesta texts. Old Persian or Achemenian, Pahlavi, Modern Persian, Pustu and Armenian belong to this group.

(iii) The Semetic languages derived from the Assyrian, Hebrew, Armanic (Aramaen) refer to Arabic, Himgaritic which are said to have entered the Western Himalayas after the advent of Islam. (iv) The inhabitants of Balti which is bounded on the north by the Muztagh range and Nagar, on the east by Ladakh, on the south by Wardwan and Zanskar and on the west by Gilgit and Astor speak a language distinct from the Western Tibetan Dialect or Bodi, Budhlor Bhot of Ladakh. Grierson in his Linguistic Survey of India (III.3) mentions the special characteristics of Balti. Sprigg has recently studied the peculiarities of the Balti speech in general. (v) The Brukpa people who are said to have migrated from Dardistan speak a distinct speech other than Balti and Ladakhi. In this respect, Siddheswar Varma in his study on Burushaski Language (1920) has focussed the linguistic peculiarities verily. At the same time the traditional account of the Bon-po priests, who had once migrated frorn Tazik (Stag gzig, broadly identified with Iran or old Persia in the Tibetan Literature), refer to their previous settlement in Brudza, (also written brug dza/brug toha/bru sa) in the Western Himalayas. The Bon po priests had there a separate speech named Zhang Zhung (also pron. hsang hsung/Shang Shung) which does not hold resemblance to Bodi/Bhoti of Ladakh offshooted from the Western Tibetan dialect, i.e. toi ka (stod skad).[unquote](S.K.

[quote] Samskrita as the name suggests, means "put together, constructed", "well formed", "perfected" (sam + s - krta or samskrta). (The formation of samskr in place of samkr is on the analogy of pariskara and upaskara). Presumably "well formed" suggests two factors: (i) Some speech was existent before that was well formed (samskrta). Attention may be invited to some sutras from the Astaddhyai of Panini: Mayura vamsakayasca (2.1.72) mundascasau kambajas'ceti-kambaja-munda. Similarly, may yavanamunda be referred to. Panini also took care of peculiar forms which had been in usage. For example: Kumarah sramanadibhih is compounded as Kumarasra-mana (2.1.70).
(ii) The language after being refined becomes well-formed. For instance, Panini (in 4.3.12728) refers to the formation of the Sakala in forming alternative words in adjective. For instance:
samgha - 'nka - laksanesva an -yan, inam an. (4.3.127)
Panini in his Astadhyayi mentions some of his predecessors like Yaska, Sakatayana and Varsyayani, who might have been predecessors in endeavouring the systematization of the language spoken by the locals in evidence. Probably Panini appeared 400 years before the **Christian era. He belonged to Kashmir, when it was the gateway from Central Asia to India. Panini ventured to compose his Sutra a Samskrta bhasa in eight chapters to establish Arianization in the area to which he belonged. He had a wide vision and close association with the then Aryavarta. In this respect some studies have already been made by the scholars of India and abroad. An attempt prevails in Western linguistics to hunt the intellectual ancestor of Panini, what is known as the ancestor hunt. In this regard Adam Makkai and William M. Christie have discussed in detail in their article "whose Intellectual Ancestor was Panini - Really?" (See S.K. Chatterjee Commemoration volume, Ed. by Bhakti P. Mallik. The University of Burdwan, 1981 pp. 134-144). [quote]--Malvika Bandyopadhaya, Sanskritic Impact on the Speech of Ladakhi Garkhuns

Śāradā-Abugida syllabic script
"The word abugida is derived from the four letters, 'ä, bu, gi, and da, in much the same way that abecedary is derived from Latin letters a be ce de, abjad is derived from the Arabic a b j d, and alphabet is derived from the names of the two first letters in the Greek alphabet, alpha and beta. Abugida as a term in linguistics was proposed by Peter T. Daniels in his 1990 typology of writing systems."(loc.cit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida; Daniels, Peter T. (OctoberDecember 1990), "Fundamentals of Grammatology", Journal of the American Oriental Society, 119 (4): 727–731,)
[ quote] The earliest known records in which the Sharada characters appear for the first tirne are the coins of the Utpala dynasty of Kashmir (9th century)2 and a brief record incised on the fragment of a broken jar discovered from the precincts of the Avantiswami temple and containing the name of Avantivarma (855-883 A.D.) the founder of the temple3. Of about the same date is the Sarahan Prashasti of queen Somaprakha, spouse of Satyaki, a ruling chieftain of Sarahan opposile Saho in ancient Chamba (Himachal Pradesh)4. Among the other records of slightly later date mention may be made of the Dewai (NWFP) inscription of the Shahi king Bhimadeva (lOth century)5, inscriptions of the reign of queen Didda (A.D. 980/11003)6 in Lahore Museum and S.P.S.Museum, Srinagar, the Brahmor and Sungal (District Chamba, Himachal Pradesh) copper plate inscriptions of king Yugakaravarman and his son Vidagdhadeva7, Barikot and Hund (NWFP) inscriptions from Hund including that of the
