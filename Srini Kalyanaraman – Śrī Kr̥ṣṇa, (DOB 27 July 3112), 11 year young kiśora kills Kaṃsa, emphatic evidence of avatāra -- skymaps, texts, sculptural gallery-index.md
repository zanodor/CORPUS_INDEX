Chennakesava Temple, Somanathpura (Wikimedia Commons)
Snapshot
• How the sculptors of this temple in Karnataka stayed true to the stories of Srimad Bhagatvatam.
In the 13th century, Somanatha a Dandanayaka, a general of Hoysala King Narasimha III, founded a small town Somanathapura.
The town followed the cherished Hindu principle of making a temple as the central node.



8
The temple so built at the centre of Somanathapura was the Chennakesava (beautiful Kesava) temple.
In the year 1268 CE, the temple was consecrated along with an installation of a community of scholars and archakas. This was called 'Vidyanidhi Prasanna Somanathapura' according to the inscription.
The inscription provides an interesting dimension about contemporary Hindu society. It speaks of the lineage of Soma thus:
In the race born from the feet of Brahma arose Rudra who was a minister of king Hermadi, lord of Kalyana; his son was Mailaya-nayaka; his son, Heggada-nayaka, who was also a subordinate of the lord of Kalyana, to him and his wife Revala was born Soma.
We also come to know that Rudra was also known as ‘Rudra-Nayaka Ganda-Pendara’.
Malaiya Nayaka who had the title Gayi-Govala, served the Chalukyan king Jagadekamalla.
According to the inscription, the agrahara established in Somanathapura was so scholarly that 'even the parrots of the agraharas could be heard discussing mimamsa, tarka and vyakarana.’
Somanathapura Chennakesava temple , Karnataka The temple, exhibiting ‘'trikutachala order' is considered one of the finest examples of Hoysala architecture.

The main sanctum sanctorum of the east-facing temple houses the three forms of Vishnu-Kesava, Gopala and Janardhana.
The outer wall of the main temple is raised on a Jagati or cosmic platform. The lower part of the outer wall shows various bands depicting various historical scenes, ornamental bands and depictions from the Ramayana, Srimad Bhagavata and the Mahabharata.
The Bhagavatam panels start with Maha Vishnu reclining on his Sheshanaga or Adisesha with Mahalakshmi pressing his feet. On either side are shown earthly, natural scenes.
The corresponding narrative would be Mother Earth coming to Maha Vishnu to ease her pain because of the burden of adharmic activities of humans on earth.
Maha Vishnu on the celestial milk ocean reclining on Adishesha with Lakshmi pressing his feet. In the panel below, Vasudeva is leaving the prison Kamsa had put him in, carrying his newborn child in his arms. Yamuna was in flood. There was heavy rain. And so, Adisesha is seen forming an umbrella over Vasudeva’s head.



10
Vasudeva with infant Sri Krishna leaves the prison Kamsa had put him in. The next panel shows Vasudeva reaching Gokulam of Nandagopa and exchanging the child for Yashoda’s daughter. Gokulam can be identified here by the depiction of cows.
Vasudeva ready to swap infant Sri Krishna with Yashoda’s new-born girl child.



11
The next panel shows Kamsa (at the right) trying to kill the girl child and (moving left-ward) the child becoming the multi-armed ferocious Goddess Durga, warning Kamsa that the child destined to kill him is alive and well.
A terrified Kamsa is also depicted as having fallen down.
A ferocious feminine form arises before the infant-killer to announce his doom. Another panel depicts Putana, the demoness who was sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna.
She offers her poison-coated breast to the infant and Krishna sucks the life out of her along with the milk, and liberates her.



12
Sri Krishna giving salvation to Puthana: she got what even great Rishis could only dream. In a panel, Krishna is shown kicking the cart wheel --- the depiction is so true to the verse in the Bhagavatam: 'The cart underneath He was put was hit by His delicate feet that were as tender as a new leaf. It turned over so that all the bowls, plates and the sweetness they contained fell to the ground, the wheels and axle got dislocated and the pole was broken.'
He kicked the cart down with His tender feet.



13
Another panel shows Brahma hiding the cowherds and cows and calves whom he had immersed into a sleep-like state. However, he is bewildered to see the same number of boys and cows and calves still with Krishna.
Krishna, through his yoga-maya, had expanded into multiple forms. Brahma gets humbled. This episode of the Bhagavata is elaborately depicted.
The humbling of a creator deity before an all-pervading Unity that manifests through diversity is an important darshana of Hindu spirituality that has been shown through such Puranic illustrations.
Depiction of the humbling of Brahma by Sri Krishna.
Creator deity subdued before Sri Krishna. The ‘Kaliya Nardhana’.



14
Krishna dancing on the hood of Kaliya; this panel shows the boys and calves frolicking by the river and then Sri Krishna dancing on the serpent with the serpent maidens asking for mercy.
Krishna spares Kaliya.
Kaliya Nardhana
A closer look at Kaliya Nardhana. Aghasura, elder brother of Putana, took the form of a gigantic snake and with an open mouth lay waiting.



15
Cowherds with their cattle walked into his open mouth thinking that it was a cave. Krishna seeing this entered the serpent and then took His magnificent form, killing the serpent demon and liberating the swallowed cowherds.
Shri Krishna kills Aghasura, an Asura, in the form of giant serpent swallowing the cowherds. Krishna also stopped the puja to Indra and made the Yadavas worship the Govardhan mountain.
Then his clan and cattle face the wrath of Indra. But Krishna lifts the Govardhan mountain and protects them. Indra is subdued.



16
Govardhan Puja: Shri Krishna makes his people worship the Govardhan mountain rather than Indra.
Govardhandhari: Sri Krishna lifts the mountain to protect the cowherds from the fury of Indra. Indra is humbled. One day, Balarama was tired, so Krishna sat by his side and started pressing his legs.
At that time they were attracted by the sweet fragrance of palm fruits. However, the palm-tree forests were under the control of Dhenukasura who was in the form of a ferocious donkey who killed anyone who came in there attracted by the fragrance.
Balarama and Krishna proceeded to the palm-tree forest and started gathering the fruits. When Dhenukasura came charging Balarama caught hold of him and slayed him. The panel below depicts this scene.
Killing the hoarder Dhenukasura to share the bounty of nature. Kamsa was bent on killing Krishna and sent the demon Keshi --- who came in the form of a ferocious horse.



17
Creating havoc and spreading fear all along, Keshi roared like a lion and charged towards Krishna.
Krishna penetrated Keshi's mouth with his hand, knocking off his teeth. Then Krishna expanded his hand muscles and the demon choked to death.
Kesava slaying Keshi, the Asura in the form of a horse. Pralambasur, another Asura, decided to slay Balarama through a trick.
As the cowherds were playing mock-fights, they announced that the defeated should carry the victor on their shoulders. Pralambasura got defeated by Balarama. So he carried Balarama on his shoulders. Soon he started running, assuming his true demonic form.
Balarama struck Pralambasura with the might of Adishesha that he was, and the demon died with a broken head.
Balarama kills Pralambasura who attempts to kidnap Balarama. The following panel depicts Krishna and Balarama on their way to Mathura. Krishna forcibly takes good garments from Kamsa’s washer-man. However the garland-maker Sudamana gives the Yadava heroes Krishna and Balarama the garlands and other ornaments out of love and devotion.



18
The person on the right with a hunched form and with the foot of Sri Krishna on the foot of that form suggests it could be a depiction of Trivakra Kubja. But the absence of a feminine form as well as the big basket on the head argue against such an identification.
Attendants of Kamsa and their differing attitude towards sharing the common riches. Kuvalayapeeda was the royal yet savage elephant who Kamsa was nurturing for perhaps this specific event to encounter with Krishna. The elephant was at the gate of the Danuryagna venue and it charged at Krishna and Balarama.
Krishna overcame the elephant and killed it.
Kuvalayapeeda the royal elephant of Kamsa being slayed by Sri Krishna. Then the divine heroes entered the ritual platform where the colossal bow was kept. Krishna took it like ‘an elephant taking a sugarcane’ and broke it easily. Then Balarama and Krishna battled the wrestlers Mushtika and Chanura.



19
The ritual bow kept by Kamsa taken and broken by Shri Krishna.
Chanura and Mushtika - wrestlers slayed by Krishna and Balarama. Ultimately, Shri Krishna killed Kamsa. Then he liberated not only Devaki and Vasudeva, his parents but also the imprisoned Ugrasena, and crowned him as the king.



20
Kamsa killed by Shri Krishna. Imprisoned Ugrasena and others watch with relief. These are the Srimad Bhagavatam panels that one can see so vibrantly carved on the walls of the main temple in Somanathapura.

Canto 10
ŚB 10.45.3
नास्मत्तो युवयोस्तात ननत्योत्कण्ठितयोरनि । बाल्यिौगण्डकै शोरा : िुत्राभ्यामभवन्‍्ककव नित् ॥ ३ ॥
[Lord Kṛṣṇa said:] Dear Father, because of Us, your two sons, you and mother Devakī always remained in anxiety and could never enjoy Our childhood, boyhood or youth.
https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/45/3/
(34) While Kamsa thus most angrily was raving, the Imperishable Lord with ease jumped up and quickly climbed on the high royal dais. (35) Seeing Him coming, his own death, Kamsa, smart as he was, immediately stood up from his seat and took up his sword and shield. (36) Kamsa, sword in hand moved about from the left to the right as quick as a hawk in the sky, but he was seized by the force of the Lord's irresistible and fearsome strength, like a snake by the son of Târkshya [Garuda]. (37) He grabbed him by the hair and knocked the crown off his head. The Lord with the Lotus Navel then hurled him from the high platform down into the wrestling arena, whereupon He, the Independent Support of the



23
Entire Universe, threw Himself on top of him [to kill him]. (38) Like a lion with an elephant, He dragged him dead along the ground before the eyes of all the people, from whom then loudly arose an 'Oh, oooh!' sound, oh King of the humans. (39) Since he, constantly being filled with anxiety, had seen Him, the Controller with the cakra in His hand, before his mind's eye whenever he drank or ate, walked, slept or breathed, he [being liberated] thus obtained that very same so most difficult to acquire form [see also sârûpya 10.41: 42 and 10.29: 13]. (40) His eight younger brothers Kanka, Nyagrodhaka and the rest, then infuriated attacked to avenge their brother. (41) Thus rushing forward ready to strike, they were beaten down by Balarâma who wielded His club like the lion king ruling the animals. (42) Kettledrums resounded in the sky and Brahmâ, S'iva, the other gods and expansions of the Lord, being pleased, chanted praises and showered flowers upon Him, while their wives were dancing...
S'rî S'uka said: 'The Supreme Lord, the Maintainer of All the Worlds, consoled the wives of the king [and his brothers], and arranged as prescribed the funeral rites for the deceased. (50) Krishna and Râma thereupon freed Their father and mother from their fetters and proved Their respect for them by touching their feet with Their heads. (51) Devakî and Vasudeva offered, in recognition of [Them as being] the Controllers of the Universe, their obeisances with joined palms and - apprehensively - did not embrace their sons.'

Kaṃsa (कं स) refers to:—Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s uncle who usurped the throne of his father, Ugrasena, the king of the Yadus, who ruled from the city of Mathurā. He tried repeatedly to kill Kṛṣṇa, but was instead killed by Kṛṣṇa.
Son of Ugrasena, King of Mathurā, and an incarnation of an Asura called Kālanemi.
Kālanemi was born as Kaṃsa and he killed the six children of Devakī by striking them on the ground. (Skandha 4, Devī Bhāgavata).
Vasudeva and Devakī are imprisoned.
Vasudeva married Devakī daughter of Ugrasena and sister, of Kaṃsa. Kaṃsa pleased with his sister presented her with a chariot. Kaṃsa, Vasudeva and Devakī ascended the chariot and



24
Kaṃsa himself drove the chariot. Then from an unknown source above came a voice which said "Oh King, know thou this and from this moment chalk out thy plans for the future. The eighth son of your sister will kill you for certain. You will be no match against him." (Chapter 1, Bhāgavata 10th Skandha).
Hearing this voice from heaven Kaṃsa got furious and dragging his sister by the hair raised his sword to kill her. Vasudeva then pleaded weeping not to kill Devakī. Only the eighth child of Devakī was going to kill him. Vasudeva would hand over all the children to him as soon as they were born. Such arguments pacified Kaṃsa and he left off Devakī without hurting her.
Devakī delivered a son. He grew up under the name of Kīrtimān and one day Nārada visited Kaṃsa and told him that he was the incarnation of an Asura named Kālanemi and the son who would be born to Devakī to kill him was Nārāyaṇa. Kaṃsa, blind with fury, killed Kīrtimān by striking him on the earth and imprisoned both Devakī and Vasudeva.
Man-hunt of Kaṃsa.
Pralamba, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta, Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭaka, Keśī, Dhenuka, Agha, Vivida and Pūtanā were born in the Asura family as servants of Kaṃsa. He sent them to different sides of the country to torment the Yādavas. Many Yādavas left the place. Even Kaṃsa’s father Ugrasena, a great devotee of Viṣṇu was teased.
In the meantime Devakī delivered six sons including Kīrtimān and all of them were killed by Kaṃsa by smashing their heads against the ground below. The seventh foetus of Devakī was aborted. (Instructed by Mahāviṣṇu, Māyādevī invoked the seventh foetus of Devakī and transferred it to the womb of Rohiṇī another wife of Vasudeva. The child thus born to Rohinī was Saṅkarṣaṇa or Balabhadrarāmā. Mahāviṣṇu then entered the womb of Devakī instructing Māyādevī to enter that of Yaśodā, wife of Nandagopa of Ambāḍi at the same time. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was then born in the figure of Viṣṇu. The watchmen were sleeping. Following directions from the new-born child Vasudeva took the child to Gokula and leaving the child there brought back the child of Yaśodā and placed it near Devakī. When the watchmen awoke and knew about the delivery of Devakī they immediately ran to Kaṃsa to tell him. Boiling with rage Kaṃsa rushed to the side of Devakī and taking the child by the legs raised it for smashing it against the ground. The child to the frightened dis may of Kaṃsa slipped from his hand and rising up in the air said "Hi, ill-mannered wicked Kaṃsa, do not waste your valour on women. Your killer has already been born on earth. Do search for him quickly."
Kaṃsa went pale with fright on hearing this and went away to his palace.
Conspiracy of Kaṃsa.
The thought that his killer was born somewhere made him restless. He let off Vasudeva and Devakī finding them innocent. Then he sat sadly pondering over the future. The courtiers then advised him to kill all the children who had been born within the past ten days and that would include the killer also. Kaṃsa accordingly sent to different parts of the country his secret agents to kill all children, ten days old.
During this campaign Pūtanā, Śakaṭa, Tṛṇāvarta, Ariṣṭaka and Keśī tried to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa also but Kṛṣṇa killed them all easily. For details see under each head separately. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).



25
Kaṃsa is slain.
Ariṣṭaka was one of the prominent Asuras sent to kill Kṛṣṇa. He attacked Kṛṣṇa in the form of an ox. Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed it without any difficulty. Nārada who saw this incident informed Kaṃsa about it adding that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were the sons of Vasudeva only and the child who slipped out of his hands was the child of Yasodā. Kaṃsa got furious and he again imprisoned Vasudeva and Devakī and brought to Mathurā Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma and started thinking of ways and means to kill them. Kaṃsa arranged to conduct a grand celebration of Āyudhapūjā (worship of the weapons) and invited Kṛṣṇa and
Story of Kaṃsa Puranic encyclopaedia
by Vettam Mani | 1975
Balarāma for the same among many other gopas from Ambāḍi. He sent his chariot with Akrūra to fetch Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma from Ambāḍi. Akrūra privately informed Kṛṣṇa of the bad intentions of Kaṃsa. Nandagopa and many others from Ambāḍi started for Mathurā. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma started their journey in the chariot the gopas and gopikās assembled there cried loudly. Some blamed Akrūra.
Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma reached Mathurā. There they slew a huge wild elephant and the five Asuras, Cāṇūra, Muṣṭika, Kūṭa, Śala and Kosala whom Kaṃsa had kept ready to kill Kṛṣṇa and Rāma. Sitting on a platform watching this, Kaṃsa became frightened and restless and roared with rage thus "The sons of Nandagopa should be instantly sent away from this palace. All their wealth and all that of the gopas should be confiscated. Bind with ropes the rogue Nandagopa, and kill the wicked Vasudeva. Throw my father, Ugrasena, into the river Kālindī bound hand and foot. Even a father should be killed if he was a relative of one’s enemy."
Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma boiled with rage when they heard the orders of Kaṃsa and Kṛṣṇa, jumping on to the platform pushed Kaṃsa down and jumping down along with him killed him. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
SECTION XX
(Jarasandhta-badha Parva)
"Krishna said,--both Hansa and Dimvaka have fallen; Kansa also with all his followers has been slain. The time hath, therefore come for the destruction of Jarasandha. He is incapable of being vanquished in battle even by all the celestials and the Asuras (fighting together). We think, however, that he should be vanquished in a personal struggle with bare arms. In me is policy, in Bhima is strength and in Arjuna is triumph; and therefore, as prelude to performing the Rajasuya, we will certainly achieve the destruction of the ruler of Magadha. When we three approach that monarch in secret, and he will, without doubt, be engaged in an encounter with one of us. From fear of disgrace, from covetousness, and from pride of strength he will certainly summon Bhima to the encounter. Like death himself that slays a person however swollen with pride, the long-armed and mighty Bhimasena will effect the destruction of the king. If thou knowest my heart, if thou hast any faith in me, then make over to me, as a pledge, Bhima and Arjuna without loss of time!" https://www.sacredtexts.com/hin/m02/m02020.htm
The following verses notes that the Harivaṃśa also was composed by Vyāsa.



26
"harivaṃśastataḥ parvapurāṇaṃ khilasaṃjñitam / viṣṇuparvaśi śoścaryā visṇoḥkaṃsavadhastathā // bhaviṣyam parvacāpyuktaṃ khileṣvevādbhutaṃ mahat/ etat parvaśatam pūrṇam vyāsenoktaṃ mahātmanā //" (Ādi Parva, Chapter 2, Verses 83-84).
Following ‘Mahaprasthanika’ comes the Purana which is called Khilvansa. In this last are contained ‘Vishnuparva’, Vishnu’s frolics and feats as a child, the destruction of ‘Kansa’.
“There was also born on earth a mighty Asura known amongst the Danavas by the name of Kalanemi, endued with great strength, of grand achievements, and blessed with a large share of prosperity. He became the mighty son of Ugrasena and was known on earth by the name of Kansa. And he who was known among the Asuras by the name of Devaka and was besides in splendour like unto Indra himself, was born on earth as the foremost king of the Gandharvas.

Harivamsha Purana by Manmatha Nath Dutt | 1897 |
Book 2 - Vishnu Parva Chapter 30 - Trial of Arms
72-73. Desirous of ascending Kamsa’s pavillion in order to kill him, the powerful, largearmed and eternal Krishna, with the velocity of a lion, began to leap in the arena before him like a cloud driven by the wind.
74. Only the citizens, seated on the side of Kamsa, saw him when he leaped in the arena.
75. Kamsa was completely possessed by Destiny and so he considered Govinda coming down from the sky.
76. There upon stretching his own Parigha-like arms Krishna drew Kamsa by the hair in the arena.
77. Assailed by Krishna’s hands his golden crown, set with diamonds, fell down on earth from his head.



27
78. When Vasudeva held Kamsa by the hair he became motionless, overwhelmed and agitated and began to breath like one lifeless. He was not capable of seeing even Krishna’s face.
80. His ears were divested of Kundalas, his necklace was torn off, his arms grew lengthened and his body was shorn of ornaments and body-cloth.
81. Thus possessed by divine effulgence Kamsa’s face grew bewildered and he set forth many an exertion.
82. Coming down from the pavillion and holding Kamsa, deserving of pain, by the hair with force Keshava began to drag him in the arena.
83. The highly effulgent king of Bhoja being thus dragged by Krishna, a ditch was made by his body in the arena.
84. Thus sporting in the arena when Kamsa breathed his last Krishna threw away his body at no distance.
85. Thus struck Kamsa’s body, used to luxuries, was grinded on the ground and covered with dust.
86. His closed eyes and dark face, without the crown, were shorn of beauty like a lotus without leaves.
87. Slain not in a battle and his body not wounded with shafts and killed by being dragged by the hair Kamsa was driven away from the path of heroes.
88. But on his body were all on a sudden seen marks of nails set by Keshava, which mutilated his flesh and destroyed his life.
89-90. Having thus slain Kamsa and removed his thorns and being endued with twofold effulgence in delight the lotus-eyed Krishna first touched Vasudeva’s feet. And afterwards the descendant of Yadu bowed at the feet of his mother. She too sprinkled him with torrents of tear begotten by joy.
91. Thereupon shining in his own effulgence Madhava, according to rank and age, enquired after the well-being of all other Yadavas.
92. Holding powerfully by his hands the proud brother of Kamsa, by name Urgita, the virtuous-souled Baladeva killed him.
93. Thus having conquered their enemies and subdued their anger, those two heroes, brought up in Vraja, went delightedly to their father’s house.

Chapter 33 - Krishna Brings Back His Preceptor’s Son From the Ocean 3-4. After a few days, with a view to learn Danurveda (science of war) Rama and Krishna, adorned with vedic study and good conduct, went to this preceptor Sandipani of the city of Avanti in the province of Kashi and communicated to him their family. 12. O Krishna, I had only one son. When I had gone out on a pilgrimage to Pravasa a Timi fish carried away my son. Do you bring me back my that son."



28
13. With Rama’s consent Krishna said "it will be so." And then going to the ocean Hari entered into its water.
14. With folded hands the regent of the ocean came to Vasudeva, who said "Where is Sandipani’s son?"
15. The ocean replied, "O Madhava, a huge-bodied demon, by name Pancajana, has devoured that boy, in the form of a Timi fish."
16. Hearing it the eternal Purusha Acyuta (Krishna) went to Pancajana and killed him. But he did not get his preceptor’s son.
17. The conch, which Janarddana obtained after slaying Pancajana, is known amongst gods and men as Pancajanya.
18. Thereupon that foremost of Purushas repaired to the abode of Vaivasvan (Yama). Then approaching him Yama saluted Gadadhara.
19. Krishna said to him:—"Give me my preceptor’s son." Thereat there took place a terrible encounter between them both.
20. Thereupon having vanquished the fearful son of Vivasvan, the foremost of Purusha Acyuta obtained the child son of his preceptor.
21-23. He then brought from Yama’s abode his preceptor’s son lost for a long time. By the power of Krishna of peerless energy Sandipani’s son, dead long ago, returned in his bodily form. Beholding this highly wonderful feat which cannot be thought of or performed by any all the creatures were filled with surprise. Taking his preceptor’s son, Pancajanya and diverse precious jewels, Madhava, the Lord of the universe, returned.
24. Having brought all those precious jewels through Yama’s servants the Rakshasas Vasava’s younger brother (Krishna) dedicated them to his preceptor.
25-26. Having handed over to their preceptor Sandipani, his son, of the same age and beauty, as before, together with all the jewels the highly intelligent Rama and Keshava, the foremost of all the warriors, in all the worlds, in the use of clubs, swords and various other weapons, were pleased.
27. Being greatly pleased with the reconciliation with his son, who had been lost for a long time Kashyas’s son Sandipani honored greatly Rama and Keshava.
28. Having acquired mastery in the use of all weapons and honored their preceptor, those two vow-observing and heroic sons of Vasudeva returned to Mathura.
Kāśi was overpowered by Kamsa, the king of Kosala earning him the
title ‘Baranasiggaho’– the conqueror of Baranasi-which he added to the string of his titles (Seyya Jataka and Tesakuna Jataka).
https://sreenivasaraos.com/?s=kamsa The Anu-gita which appears at the end of Mahabharata reveres Krishna as Vishnu. There are at least six instances in Mahabharata (including the one of Bhagavad Gita) where Krishna displays his awe inspiring cosmic form (vishva rupa) to demonstrate his divine essence.



29
8.1. Krishna has long been worshipped and revered as Supreme god. The great grammarian Panini (8th century BCE) in his Astadhyayi explains the term vasudevaka as the devotee of Krishna -Vasudeva. Later, Patanjali (3rd century BCE) in his Mahabhashya too defines the term bhakta (devotee) as the ‘follower of Vasudeva, God of gods’- ke cit kaṃsa-bhaktāḥ
bhavanti ke cit vāsudeva-bhaktāḥ (P_3,1.26.6). Patanjali quotes a verse: “May the might of Krishna accompanied by Sankarshana increase! – saṅkarṣaṇa-dvitīyasya balam kṛṣṇasya vardhatām iti -(P_2,2.24.4) “ 8.2. The Arthashastra of Kautilya, of fourth century BC, refers several times to Krishna; while the Baudhayana Dharma Sutra (Baudh 2.5.9.10) of the same century gives twelve different names for Krishna, including popular ones like Keshava, Govinda, and Damodara. ... The icons depicting Krishna eliminating the evil form a... group of Krishna’s iconographic visualization. He subdues the evil ones, such as Kalinga the python, puts an end to agents of death such as Baka, Puthana and Kubalyapitha and others. Here, the detached Krishna eliminates evil, protects environment and Yamuna; removes the polluting venom; puts out forest fires and so on. As Govardhana-dhari, Krishna lifts mount Govardhana on his left hand little finger for protecting Vrindavana, its people, animals, nature and so on, from Indra’s ire. His major act of valour in his adolescence was the elimination of Kamsa and Chanura; and establishing a just social order. Apart from these acts of bravery, Krishna also dispels misgivings and imparts true understanding and knowledge. [Much later in his life, Krishna, as Partha Sarathi, on the battle field, teaches Arjuna the true perspective of life; and the ways that wise persons act in life].

The years that followed Pandu’s death were truly of great distress ...At that time the entire north India as also the Yadava country was in turmoil. They were under repeated attacks by Jarasandha of Magadha (Bihar) who formed a confederation consisting Dantavakra of Karusha and Sishupala of Chedi in central India, Bhishmaka of Vidarbha in the south-west, Kalayavana beyond the western borders, the ruler of Kashi (Benares), Paundraka Vasudeva of Pundra (Bengal) in the east, Naraka of Pragjyotishapura (Assam) in the north east. Jarasandha thus established a tyrannical supremacy over the other regions. For fear of Jarasandha and his hordes, the king of the Salwayana tribe with their brethren and followers such as the southern Panchalas and the eastern Kosalas all fled to the country of the Kuntis. Similarly, the Matsyas (Rajasthan area) and the Sannyastapadas, overcome with fear, fled into the southern country. And so did the others, alarmed at the power of jarasandha, left their kingdoms and fled in all directions. Jarasandha was particularly angry with the establishment at Mathura and the Yadavas in general, because his son-in-law Kamsa had been slain by Yadava-Krishna. Jarasandha, in rage and retaliation, attacked and imprisoned as many as eighty-six princes, it is said. Krishna , in order to save the Yadavas from being enslaved , persuaded his clan leaders to abandon Mathura; and, to re-establish themselves in the fortified city of Dwaraka , on the western seashore. It is said; the eighteen tribes of Yadavas , including the Bhojas, with the Surasenas, the Bhadrakas, the Yodhas, the Salwas, the Patachchavas, the Susthalas, the Mukuttas, and the Kulindas, along with the Kuntis, all fled towards the west , for fear of jarasandha. Meanwhile, Bhishma who then was the regent of the Kingdom of Hasthinapura found it wiser and safer to appease; and, to make truce with Jarasandha. Srimad Bhagavatha Purana even



30
mentions that some troops of Hasthinapura assisted Jarasandha and accompanied the Magadha army’s onslaught on Mathura.

"Gandhari said, ‘The Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, O Krishna, have both been burnt. Whilst they were thus being exterminated, O Janardana, why wert thou indifferent to them? Thou wert competent to prevent the slaughter, for thou hast a large number of followers and a vast force. Thou hadst eloquence, and thou hadst the power (for bringing about peace). Since deliberately, O slayer of Madhu, thou wert indifferent to this universal carnage, therefore, O mighty-armed one, thou shouldst reap the fruit of this act. By the little merit I have acquired



31
through waiting dutifully on my husband, by that merit so difficult to attain, I shall curse thee, O wielder of the discus and the mace! Since thou wert indifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other, therefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen! In the thirty-sixth year from this, O slayer of Madhu, thou shalt, after causing the slaughter of thy kinsmen and friends and sons, perish by disgusting means in the wilderness. The ladies of thy race, deprived of sons, kinsmen, and friends, shall weep and cry even as these ladies of the Bharata race!’"
Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing these words, the high-souled Vasudeva, addressing the venerable Gandhari, said unto her these words, with a faint smile, ‘There is none in the world, save myself, that is capable of exterminating the Vrishnis. I know this well. I am endeavouring to bring it about. In uttering this curse, O thou of excellent vows, thou hast aided me in the accomplishment of that task. The Vrishnis are incapable of being slain by others, be they human beings or gods or Danavas. The Yadavas, therefore shall fall by one another’s hand.’ After he of Dasharha’s race had said these words, the Pandavas became stupefied. Filled with anxiety all of them became hopeless of life!’"

"The holy one said, ‘Arise, arise, O Gandhari, do not set thy heart on grief! Through thy fault, this vast carnage has taken place! Thy son Duryodhana was wicked-souled, envious, and exceedingly arrogant. Applauding his wicked acts, thou regardest them to be good. Exceedingly cruel, he was the embodiment of hostilities, and disobedient to the injunctions of the old. Why dost thou wish to ascribe thy own faults to me? Dead or lost, the person that grieves for what has already occurred, obtaineth more grief. By indulging in grief, one increases it two-fold. A woman of the regenerate class bears children for the practice of austerities; the cow brings forth offspring for bearing burdens; the mare brings forth her young for acquiring speed of motion; the Shudra woman bears a child for adding to the number of servitors; the Vaishya woman for adding to the number of keepers of cattle. A princess, however, like thee, brings forth sons for being slaughtered!’"

Gandhari blames Krishna for his devious ways that brought death and destruction upon the Kuru clan.
“Oh Madhusudana, You purposely destroyed the Kurus; made pretence of carrying out peace-talks (icchatopekṣito nāśaḥ kurūṇāṃ madhusūdana- 11.25.38). You let the two
warring kinsmen devastate each other. Now, take the result of that. I curse you. If I have been a devoted and faithful wife, may my curse come true. Krishna, mark my words, you will slay your own kinsmen. Just as Pandavas and Kurus were killing each other, your kinsmen too will kill each other. As your cousins, their sons and grandsons slay each other; you will wander about in the woods in desolation and die a lonely and ignominious death at the hands of a stranger. And your wives, having lost their sons, grandsons, brothers and dear ones shall run around the woods in desperation and grief, just as the Bharatha women are now doing
tavāpy evaṃ hatasutā nihata -jñāti-bāndhavāḥ, striyaḥ paripatiṣyanti yathaitā bharatastriyaḥ [Mbh. 11.25. 38-42]
14.2. Vyasa calls Gandhari’s curse as a ‘horrible speech’ (vacanaṃ ghoraṃ). But, Krishna heard it calmly (vāsudevo mahāmanāḥ) and remarked with a smile ‘your curse is



32
preordained by fate. As none can destroy the Vrisni Yadavas, they slay and kill each other; and, they will all come to destruction at each other’s hands.” [Mbh. 11.25. 43-44]
