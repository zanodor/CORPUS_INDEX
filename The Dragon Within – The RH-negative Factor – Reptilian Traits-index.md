There is a hypothesis that Quetzalcoatl (Rh-Negative blood factor) was a viking, sole survivor of a sea 1/6



exploration. Or a Celtic person from the Tribe of DANA.
The KEY is in the HEART of the CELL. * FRACTAL Genetic Embedded Information. * Fractal Structure : Embedding Immortality SEE : http://www.danwinter.com/gold/index.shtml

Blood Factor ( Rh+ or Rh-) and Morphogenetic Field Tuning.
* Your Rh status describes whether or not you have a protein on the surface of red blood cells. If you don't have the Rh factor, you're considered Rh-negative; if you have it, you're Rh-positive. About 85 percent of people are Rh-positive, though it varies by race. For African Americans, about 90-95 percent are Rhpositive, and for Asians, the figure is 98 to 99 percent. Hmmmm
Rh-Negatives are RARE.
But, strangely.... a person with type O negative blood is considered to be a "Universal Donor". It means his or her blood can be given to anyone, regardless of blood type, without causing a transfusion reaction.
The Rh-Negatives Factor is considered a "Mutation" of "Unknown Origin", which happened in Europe, about 25,000-35,000 years ago. Then this group spread heavily into the area of what is now Spain, England, Ireland, etc.
The Process of Alloimmunization
During the birthing process, blood cells from the unborn child can escape into the mother's bloodstream. These cells are recognized as foreign if they are a different blood type from the mother and a natural rejection process will ensue with the formation of antibodies. The process is known as red cell alloimmunization. Extracted from : http://www.med.unc.edu/obgyn/rh.htm
Modes of Inheritance
In more than 98% of cases, the red blood cell incompatibility involves the Rhesus or Rh D antigen[Rhnegative Factor] so the disease is known as Rhesus disease or Rh disease. Although the exact percentage varies with race, 15% of the United States population is Rh-negative and 85% is Rh-positive. If a Rhnegative woman conceives a child with a Rh-positive partner, the potential exists for the child to inherit its father's Rh-positive blood type.[ There are two types of Rh-positive men. In 55% of individuals, the man is heterozygous. In this situation, his genetics allow him to produce Rh-negative offspring 50% of the time and Rh-positive offspring the remaining 50% of the time. In the second type of a Rh-positive= individual, homozygous state.]
So... Rh-negative women with a Rh-positive partner are at RISK of spontaneous miscarriage and other fetus REJECTION events. Hmmmm And a Rh-negative woman with a Rh-negative partner has even a smaller chance of having a Baby born alive! Hmmmm... In animals this is seen as a problem, in HYBRID Animals.
Rh-negative women and men have several "Unusual Traits" that Rh-positives don't. Some call them "Reptilian Traits".
* An EXTRA-Vertebra (a "Tail Bone")....some are born with a tail(called a "Cauda"). * Lower than normal Body Temperature * Lower than normal Blood Pressure * Higher mental analytical abilities. * Higher Negative-ion shielding (from positive "charged" virus/bacteria)around the body. * High Sensitivity to EM and ELF Fields. * Hyper Vision and other senses. * Etc.

EUROPE'S MYSTERY PEOPLE :
http://www.knowledge.co.uk/frontiers/sf085/sf085a02.htm The researches of R. Frank, a scholar at the University of Iowa, suggest that the Basques were faradvanced in navigational skills and other aspects of technology long before the rise of the Roman Empire. The Basques, she believes, are the last remnants of the megalith builders, who left behind dolmens, standing stones, and other rock structures all across Europe and perhaps even in eastern North America.
Two facts set the Basque peoples apart from the other Europeans who have dominated the continent the past 3,000 years: (1) The Basque language is distinctly different; and (2) The Basques have the highest recorded level of Rh-negative blood (roughly twice that of most Europeans), as well as substantially lower levels of Type B blood and a higher incidence of Type O blood.
Some probable technological feats of the Basques or their ancestors are:
Stonehenge and similar megalithic structures....A unique system of measurement based on the number 7, instead of 10, 12, or 60 Regular visits to North America long before Columbus to fish and to trade for beaver skins. Recently unearthed British customs records show large Basque imports of beaver pelts from 13801433. The invention of a sophisticated navigational device called an "abacus." (No relation to the common abacus.)

Human Genetics...
Odd, the REPTILIAN "Aliens" like Abducting the Rh-Negative Humans.
*Human Genetic Traits and Conditions: http://www.bsc.ufl.edu/bsc/HumanGenetics.shtml
Hmmm... The widow's peak ; Tongue rolling ; Ear lobes ; Freckles ; Eye color ; Polydactyly ; Webbed feet and/or hands ; Albinism ; Rh blood groups ; Cauda ; etc.
CAUDA EQUINA - The bundle of spinal nerve roots arising from the end of the spinal cord and filling the lower part of the spinal canal(from approximately the thoraco-lumbar junction down). Embryology : Caudally the tail region projects over the cloacal membrane.
Cauda : the tail. The embryonic Human HAS a TAIL! * We ALL my be part REPTILIAN. How does the cauda equina develop?
In the third month, the spinal cord extends through the entire length of the embryo. With increasing age the vertebral column and dura mater lengthen more rapidly than the neural tube and the caudal end of spinal cord shifts to a higher level of the vertebral canal. As a result of this differential growth, the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerves= run obliquely from their segment of origin to the corresponding level of the vertebral column.
In Sanskrit "Ketuu" =3D The south Lunar Node, also known as "Cauda= Draconis", in latin. The "Dragon's Tail", in English. The Dragon's Tail (South Node):
Aspects to the South Node display the results of "Innate Unconscious Tendencies"[In the DNA?] and "Karmic Patterns", as they emerge in life.
The Draconic Zodiac, is used by some astrologers searching for hidden spiritual truths. The Dragon, TALI, Theli. Tali or Theli refers to the 12 Zodiacal constellations along the great circle of the Ecliptic; where it ends there it begins again, and so the ancient occultists drew the Dragon with its tail in its mouth. Some have thought that Tali referred to the constellation Draco, which meanders across the Northern polar sky; others have referred it to the Milky Way; others to an imaginary line joining Caput to Cauda Draconis, the upper and lower nodes of the Moon.
Once upon a time..... there were three zodiacs: the Sidereal, the Tropical, and the Draconic. Shhhh... http://anastralwelcome.hypermart.net/dragontxt.htm

The Vertex, called a point of fateful encounters over which we have no conscious control, is the intersection of the great circles of the ecliptic... In the Draconic Chart the ecliptic plane of the Sun, the equatorial=20 plane of the Earth, and that of the Lunar orbit are all brought together....= Light paths meet Earth. Hmmmm For the Earth (as a whole), this would be in August of 1999!
The Hero in our Fairy Tales became a great prince, won great love,= gained riches, achieved greatness and acclaim by valiantly searching out and meeting the Dragon head on, face to face.
Set out on a journey and find the Dragon.
..... And everyone lived happily ever after...........* * (except the dragon... : )
The Reptilians are tracking those with Rh-Negative Factor Blood. Going back into time....the Rh-Neg Hybrids came from the DRACO Caverns in the Carpathian Mountains. They were mostly RED Haired, with Green Eyes and Black haired, with Brown Eyes. They tried to infiltrate themselves into the Blond/Brown Haired, with Blue Eyes, Civilization. They wanted to Mate with those who were not Rh-Negatives. Most RhNegs have a Lower Body temperature and Blood pressure than Rh-Positives. Many Rh-Negs are born with a CAUDA(tail) or an Extra Vertebra (Tail Bone). Rh-Negs are Hybrids. They are Part Reptilian/part human. If two Rh-Negs try to have a baby it will usually die or be born a "BLUE Baby", because it is Not processing oxygen properly. Thus "Blue-Bloods", if they survive. 5% of the Earth's population are currently RhNegatives. But, they are 15% of the population of the England and the USA.
Dr. Luigi Cavalli-Sforza from Stanford University wrote an article entitled "Genes, Peoples and Languages" (Scientific American, Nov.'91). He pointed out the high Rh-negative concentrations among the people of Morocco, the Basque country of Euskadi, Ireland, Scotland and the Norwegian islands.
The only people among these still to speak their original neolithic language were the Basques... From http://www.islandnet.com/~edonon/intro.shtml
Also on the Rh-factor map, you will notice that the Icelandic=20 population has a very low incidence of Rhnegative individuals, unlike the rest of Scandinavia. From http://www.sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de/linguist/issues/3/3-87.shtml
The most distinctive members of the European branch of the human tree are the Basques of France and Spain. They show unusual patterns for several genes, including the highest rate of the Rh-negative blood type. Their language is of unknown origin and cannot be placed within any standard classification.
Consider Iceland, 1% of its population is Rh-negative. The population of Iceland is about two-third of Scandinavian and one-third of Irish descent. Scandinavia, Ireland, and the British Isles show from 16% to 25% and above Rh-negative. The other populations with a proportion of Rh-negative individuals similar to Iceland occupy the eastern half of Asia, Madagascar, Australia and New-Zealand.

Q17. Are the Basques genetically different from other Europeans?
A17. Apparently, yes. It has long been known that the Basques have the highest proportion of rhesusnegative blood in Europe , and one of the highest percentages of type-O blood (55%). Recently, however, the geneticist Luiga Luca Cavalli-Sforza has completed a gene map of the peoples of Europe, and he finds the Basques to be strikingly different from their neighbors. The genetic boundary between Basques and non-Basques is very sharp on the Spanish side. On the French side, the boundary is more diffuse: it shades off gradually toward the Garonne in the north. These findings are entirely in agreement with what we know of the history of the language.
Q18. Does this mean the Basques are directly descended from the earliest known human inhabitants of Europe, the Cro-Magnon people who occupied western Europe around 35,000 years ago?
A18. Nobody knows. This is possible, but we have no real evidence either way. The only evidence we have is negative: the archeologists can find no evidence for any sudden change in population in the area for
4/6



thousands of years before the arrival of the Celts and later the Romans in the first millennium BC.
The people of the Basque region have a greater than 50 percent concentration of the RH negative gene,. The frequency decreases in relation to the distance from the Basque region into the rest of the world until there is very little evidence of this gene. This genetic mapping helps to show that a mutation from RH positive to RH negative occurred somewhere in the Basque area of Europe maybe as much as 40,000 years ago, as he discussed later. Basques are not regional inhabitants of an area, as some believe - they are a completely separate and distinct race whose origins are shrouded in mystery.
Although to all outward appearances they seem to be part of the so called "white" or "caucassian" race group, they have distinct genetic differences which does not allow their being classified as part of that "white" race. For example : Basques are believed to have been the originators of the RH negative blood factor - the original genetic pool from which this factor came. While RH negatives are a small minority in the "white" and other races, and practically non-existent in "orientals", the current Basques still are over 33 % RH negative. Another salient genetic feature is the the shape and sutures (bone joints) of cranial bones of Basques[The Reptilian skull ridge]. A third skeletal difference is the tendency to having a thicker breast bone.
According to Alex Collier... The Alpha Draconians, a reptilian race composed of master geneticists, tinker with life - which from their perspective exists as a natural resource. The Draconians look at lifeforms which= they have created or altered as a natural resource. Apparently, the Alpha Draconians created the primate race, which was first brought to Mars and then to Earth. The primate race was then tinkered with....
