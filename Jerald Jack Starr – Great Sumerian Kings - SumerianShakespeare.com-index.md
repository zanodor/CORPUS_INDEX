Lugal, "king".
The stories of Ur-Namma, Gudea, and Eannatum have already been
extensively covered on other pages of this website. The purpose of this
section is to give the biographies of other great Sumerian kings. As can be
seen by the the tabs on the left, the pages for Urukagina, Lugalzagesi, and
Enmetena have already been completed. I also intend to add new
pages for Ur-Nanshe and Enannatum sometime in the near future.

Gudea. He wears a shepherd's hat, the crown of a Sumerian king.
In China, the emperor lived in the “Forbidden City”. In Japan, the citizens
were not allowed to even look at their emperor’s face. In Egypt, the
pharaohs were remote godlike beings concerned only with their own
immortality. All of these monarchs didn't really care too much for the
well-being of their subjects, for the welfare of the common people. The
Sumerians had a different concept of kingship. Their rulers were the

shepherd kings, the guardians and protectors of their flocks, the people.
Throughout history, throughout the entire world, the chieftain/ruler/king
was always a strongman who was able to impose his leadership on others
by the sheer force of his strength and will (and his army). So it is
extraordinary that the Sumerians at the very dawn of history, even as they
began to invent civilization, should develop such a modern, enlightened
view of government.
The Sumerians were the first to invent civilization, when most of the world
was still living in the Stone Age. They prospered even though they didn't
have many natural resources, and they survived even though they were
vastly outnumbered by their enemies.
One has to wonder, why did the Sumerians succeed when others would
have failed?
I suggest it's because of the shepherd kings. You cannot understand
Sumerian civilization
until you understand the shepherd kings.

The Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten. He is austere, godlike and forbidding.
On his headdress is a coiled cobra. It protects the pharaoh from evil and it
symbolizes his right to strike and kill anyone who dares to oppose him. It
must have been a daunting experience to stand in front of the pharaoh
while staring into the eyes of a menacing reptile.

A Sumerian shepherd king. Compare this benign portrait with that of
Akhenaten.
Sipa is the Sumerian word for “shepherd”, but it also means an animal
herder of any kind. It can refer to a herder of cattle, horses, and even pigs.
In the context of a king, sipa refers to a herder of sheep. This is indicated
by the fact that he wears a fleecy woolen hat and by the fact that he is often
portrayed holding a lamb, as shown above (click here to see another
example). The shepherd king being the herder of sheep makes the most
sense, symbolically speaking, as opposed to a herder of cattle, horses, or
pigs. His flock (the people) wouldn't want to be compared to lumbering

oxen yoked to a plow, or horses harnessed to a wagon, and they certainly
didn't want to be likened unto swine wallowing in filth.
There is a symbiotic relationship between a shepherd and his flock. A
shepherd is a herder of sheep, leading them to greener pastures. He tends
to the flock, he makes sure the sheep are well fed and he protects them
from predators. That is why the sheep willingly obey him. A king is a
herder of men. He tends to their many needs, makes sure they have plenty
of food, and he protects them from hostile foreign powers. In return they
willingly give him their allegiance and their obedience.
sipa lugal, shepherd king.
In hindsight, a shepherd king as the ideal of leadership seems obvious.
Originally the Sumerian rulers were the high priests of temples, but as the
city-states became stronger and more competitive the leaders became
kings who could command large armies. When these warrior kings weren’t
battling each other they could also protect the Sumerian cities from
foreign invasions. Nonetheless, the Sumerian kings never lost their
priestly aura. They were still expected to provide for the well-being of their
people on behalf of the gods. So the ideal of a shepherd seems like a
natural choice. The concept of shepherd leadership was continued by the
Babylonians long after the Sumerian civilization had disappeared, and it
later spread throughout the rest of the ancient Near East. This is why
Jesus Christ is often referred to as a shepherd, even though in real life he
was actually a carpenter.
The picture of Akhenaten shows him holding a shepherd’s crook,
symbolizing his role
as a shepherd. Early Egyptian pharaohs didn’t have this accoutrement.
Later pharaohs
got the concept of a shepherd from the Babylonians, who in turn got it
from the Sumerians. For the pharaoh, the shepherd’s crook was just an
added accessory, almost an afterthought. Everyone knows being a good
shepherd to his people was not a pharaoh’s primary concern, but for a
Sumerian king, it was his core identity.

Hammurabi. He wears a shepherd hat. He was a Babylonian king who
lived 200 years after the end of Sumerian civilization.
Origins of the Sumerian shepherd king:Two kings named on the
Sumerian King List are literally called shepherds. They are
“Etana, the shepherd, who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the
foreign countries”
and “Lugalbanda the shepherd”. They are two semi-mythological kings
from Sumerian
prehistory. According to the Sumerian King List, they reigned for 1,500
and 1,200 years
respectively (give or take a few years).
In mythology, the god Dumuzid, husband of Inanna, was a shepherd, and
many other gods are figuratively referred to as shepherds. In literature,
Sumerian kings were routinely described as being the shepherds of their
people.
The Uruk period (circa 4000 to 3000 B.C.) was the beginning of Sumerian
civilization. This is when writing was first introduced, when the city-states
started to develop, and when the Sumerian concept of kingship began to
emerge.

The “Warka Stele” (Warka is the modern name for Uruk). The king of
Uruk uses a spear and a bow and arrow to hunt lions. This was the
beginning of a long tradition of portraying kings involved in the Royal
Hunt (also see the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal hunting lions, 668 – 627
B.C.). This tradition would continue throughout history until the modern
era. It was meant to show the king being strong and brave. In this case it
also serves another purpose: The shepherd king is protecting his flock by
killing the predatory lions. The back of the stele is completely destroyed,
but there’s a good possibility it originally showed a flock of animals
that the shepherd is defending.
This emphasizes a different aspect of the shepherd king. "Shepherd"

conjures up images of someone who is peaceful and pastoral, like the
image of the Sumerian king holding a lamb. Yes, a shepherd is the gentle
guardian of his flock, but he is also their protector. So a shepherd king
needed to be a military commander. He wasn't all about "love and peace",
like a pacifist modern hippie. A hippie king wouldn't last five minutes in
the ancient world. Sumerian kings weren’t just peace-loving shepherds.
They were also warriors.
The shepherd defending his flock is translated into the king protecting his
subjects. On this seal impression he attacks the army of a hostile foreign
power while he besieges their city. One enemy soldier tries to tear out an
arrow from his thigh, another soldier has been shot through the torso, and
yet another soldier has received a painful and humiliating wound in his
backside. Scholars have often speculated on the decorative curls on the
side of the building (probably a temple or a palace). I would suggest that
the curls are actually flames. The building is on fire (perhaps the whole
city is on fire). See a photograph of the seal.
This is the first time in history that a bow and arrow is shown being used
in combat. It is also a “recurved bow”, with tips that curve away from the
archer when the bow is strung, which gives the arrow greater speed and
power. The recurved bow is just another of the countless inventions that
can be credited to the Sumerians.
A Sumerian war crime?

These scenes show the king inspecting the prisoners of war. The captives
are bound with
ropes and they are sitting or lying on the ground. One prisoner begs for
mercy. Both scenes are often described as “the beating of the prisoners”.
To modern viewers this would seem like an atrocity, but I would suggest
that the scenes represent something else entirely. The prisoners of war are
not actually being whipped or beaten – they are being tied up with ropes
and/or they're being placed into neck stocks. The loops held by two of the
victors are either nooses or neck stocks. On the Standard of Ur, for
example, the prisoners have ropes around their necks. On the other hand,
it looks like the prisoner on the upper left is being placed into a neck stock.
Scenes of war captives placed into neck stocks was a common motif
throughout ancient Mesopotamia. A similar scene occurs on one of
Sargon’s victory steles (click here to see a drawing, or read Sargon’s Other
Victory Stele on this website).
A Sumerian king had no problem portraying himself being ruthless in
combat, but he would never show himself calmly watching while
defenseless prisoners are being cruelly whipped and beaten. He was not a
war criminal, not even by the lax standards of the ancient world, where
most wars were total war. Back then, warfare was a lot less civilized.
Moving on from the ancient Uruk period, let’s take a look at the “recent”
shepherd kings of the Early Dynastic III period (circa 2600 – 2340 B.C.).

Enmetena/ ruler/ of Lagash
Enmetena ended debt slavery, where a debtor’s family members had to
become servants
until the debts were repaid: “A remission of the obligations [ama-gi4] of
Lagash he instituted. He returned the mother to the child and returned
the child to the mother, and a remission [ama-gi4] of interest-bearing
barley loans he instituted.” Ama-gi4 means “return to mother”, and it
would later come to mean “freedom” in general. Enmetena was the first
known king in history to enact social reforms for the benefit of his
subjects. See Enmetena Tablet.
One of Urukagina's Liberty
Cones.
Urukagina’s ‘Liberty Cones” are generally regarded as the world’s first
comprehensive attempt to improve the conditions of the common people
(although some of the credit must go to Enmetena’s earlier efforts; see
Enmetena, not Urukagina). These clay cones were inscribed with writing,
addressed to the gods, which described Urukagina’s reforms. Then the
cones were buried near the foundations of a new temple. On the cones
Urukagina reports that he dismissed the corrupt temple administrators
and court officials who had confiscated people’s private property. He set
wage controls, limited the amount that priests could charge to perform
their religious services, enacted tax reform, and set up charity for the poor.
He also guaranteed basic legal rights for the common citizens. For
instance, they could not be forced to sell their property to aristocrats; they
could name their own price, and they were protected from retaliation if

they chose not to sell. Urukagina enacted his many social reforms so “the
orphan or widow to the powerful will not be subjugated.” See Urukagina
and his “Liberty Cones”.
In 2350 B.C. the Sumerians were conquered by the Akkadians under
Sargon the Great. The Akkadians would then rule Sumer for almost two
centuries. After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, two of the exemplary
Sumerian kings were Gudea of Lagash (ca 2140 – 2120 B.C.) and Ur
Namma of Ur (ca 2112 - 2095 B.C.) who became the king of all of Sumer
and Akkad. This was the Neo-Sumerian Renaissance, the ultimate
expression of Sumerian civilization.
Gudea
Gudea, the true shepherd, “had everything function as it should in his city
. . . He had debts remitted and made all hands clear. . . He opened
manacles, removed fetters. . . He undid the tongue of the goad and the
whip, replacing them with wool from lamb-bearing sheep. . . He locked up
those guilty of capital offences (instead of executing them). . . He had the
daughter become the heir in the families without a son. A day of justice
dawned for him. . . Gudea paid attention to the justice of [the gods]
Nanshe and Ningirsu. He provided protection for the orphan against the
rich, and provided protection for the widow against the powerful.” See
Gudea Translation.

Ur-Namma
Ur-Namma likewise guaranteed that “the orphan to the rich man should
not be made subordinate; the widow to the powerful man should not be
made subordinate.” He codified the laws of the Land. He was the first
known king in history to do so. One of the year names
of his reign was called, “the year Ur-Namma made justice in the land.”
According to Ur-Namma, "I am a source of joy for the Land; my life
indeed creates! The fields of barley are resplendent under my rule. Since I
have been adorned with the kingship, no one imposes taxes on my
abundant crops, which grow tall. The owner of the fields walks through
the barley; it rises up to his chest. I drained the marshes. I freed the sons
of the poor from their duty of going to fetch firewood. I straightened the
road that runs from north to south." See Ur-Namma Translation and “I
am Ur-Namma”.

Let us reconsider some of the previous quotes:
Urukagina: “the orphan or widow to the powerful will not be subjugated.”
Gudea: "provided protection for the orphan against the rich, and provided
protection for the widow against the powerful."
Ur-Namma: “the orphan to the rich man should not be made subordinate;
the widow to the powerful man should not be made subordinate.”
So, just who were these rich and powerful people? Why did orphans and
widows (i.e., the common people) need to be protected from them?
They were the nobility, the priests, and rich merchants. Noblemen
oppressed their subjects every chance they got. Priests fleeced their flocks
with high fees for their religious services. Rich merchants exploited the
people for the sake of profit.
The nobility, the priests, and the rich merchants − these are exact same
people that the king relied on for his power. The nobility supported the
king with their army of peasants when summoned to the battlefield. The
priests gave the king an aura of divinity, so that his rule was sanctioned by
the gods. Rich merchants gave the king much needed infusions of gold
in exchange for land and titles of nobility.
Yet the Sumerian king promises to protect the people from his own allies,
the ones on whom his power depended. No other king in history dedicated
himself to protecting the people against his own aristocracy, his own
priesthood, and his own wealthy supporters.
It really is quite extraordinary.
Throughout history, throughout the entire world, a king made little
pretense that he governed
on behalf of the people. He was not the People’s King, he was the King of
the Nobility. He governed with the consent and cooperation of the
nobility, not the people (the priests and merchants supported whoever
was in power, regardless). If the people didn’t like it, then that was just too
bad. A Sumerian king is the only one who was the champion of the people.
He was their guardian and protector, even their servant.
The servant of the people

All Sumerian kings built canals for irrigation and transportation, planted
orchards for the poor, and ensured that their subjects were well fed. They
also built breweries, which guaranteed their subjects a steady supply of
beer. It seems that Sumerian kings were the servants of the people, rather
than the other way around. For instance, in the story of The Building of
Ningirsu’s Temple, Gudea lists some of his specific duties and those of his
officials: “namely, to make the butter abundant; to make the cream
abundant. . . to see that the great fields grow rich. . . to see the good fields
have provided wheat, emmer and all kinds of pulses, numerous grain
heaps. . . to fill the channels with flowing water, to make the marshes full
with carp and perch, and to have the inspector of fisheries and the
inspector of dikes stand at their posts, to fill the great waters with boats
carrying grain, to see that tons, heaps and tons -- the yield of the land of
Lagash -- will be piled up."
It sounds like a lot of work. Name another king who did as much.
Of course, not all Sumerian kings lived up the ideal of shepherd kingship.
Lugalanda was a notable example (as described on the Urukagina page).
He was greedy, corrupt, and sacrilegious, and he had little regard for the
well-being of his subjects. Other kings like Eannatum were more
concerned about grandiose plans of conquest and dreams of empire rather
than the welfare of the common people.
This is best illustrated by the tale of The Great Fatted Bull. The villain of
the story is Lu-mah.
He is a strong and powerful king, grasping and greedy. He only cares
about warfare and plunder, feasting and slave women, and for this he
wants to be worshiped as a living god.
On the other hand, the hero of the story is Su-ba, the “shepherd brother”.
He exemplifies the Sumerian ideal of kingship. He is the shepherd king.
Even if a Sumerian king was well intended, he could not necessarily
control the greed and corruption of his lords and noblemen, or even his
own officials. Although social injustice has existed since time immemorial
(from “distant days”, to use Urukagina’s words), it seems that Sumerian
kings made valiant efforts to correct it. They weren’t always successful, but
at least they kept trying. This is more than can be said for other monarchs
(Egyptian pharaohs or Chinese emperors, for instance, or even European
kings in the Middle Ages) whose subjects were little more than slaves. It

seems that the Sumerian people were better off than most people in the
ancient world, and in much of the world today, and this is because their
kings modeled themselves on the idea of a shepherd.
Ur-Ningirsu, the son of Gudea.
A crown changes a man when he puts it on.
How it changes him depends on the type of crown. A Sumerian king was
expected to be a general, but his crown was not a warrior’s helmet, in
which case the people’s sole purpose would be to provide soldiers for his
army. His shepherd hat was made of gold, but it was not a bejeweled
crown, signifying his wealth at the people’s expense. Though he was
sometimes worshiped as a living god, he didn't wear the horned headdress
of an actual god, symbolizing his exalted status above the common people.
Instead, a Sumerian king put on the crown of a simple shepherd. It was a
constant reminder to him (and to everyone else) that his sole duty was to
be the guardian and protector of his flock, the people.
The Sumerian civilization developed early, when the rest of the world was
still living in the Stone Age. The Sumerians prospered even though they
didn't have many natural resources. They didn't have much mineral
wealth and they didn't have an abundant supply of wood.
They didn't even have a lot of stone (imagine the civilizations of Egypt,
Greece, and Rome

without their endless supply of stone). The Sumerians lasted for
thousands of years,
even though they were outnumbered by their enemies.
I would suggest there is one reason, and one reason alone, why the
Sumerians were the first to invent civilization, why they prospered even
without natural resources, and why they lasted for as long as they did.
It's all because of the shepherd kings.
Ki-en-gi (Sumer). It means "Land of the Civilized Lords".
The shepherd kings have been around since the beginning of Sumerian
civilization.

The Kings of Uruk

The king of Uruk. He stands at the Tree of Life which blossoms with
eight-pointed rosettes.

2100 B.C.). See an enlargement of Gudea, and see Ur-Namma at the
dedication of a new temple.
The crowns of Gudea and Ur-Namma are stylized versions of a shepherd
hat. That’s because a shepherd was considered the ideal role model for a
king (see The Shepherd Kings on this website). Sumerian kings were
routinely described as the shepherds of their people. Their crowns were
doubtlessly taller and more grandiose than a real shepherd hat, which
gave the kings greater stature and made them seem more regal. The
shepherd crowns of Gudea and Ur-Namma were particularly extravagant
in this regard, but the crowns of many other Sumerian kings were more
modest in appearance. Their crowns more closely resembled the original
hats worn by shepherds in the field.
The reigns of Gudea and Ur-Namma occurred at the end of Sumerian
history, but I would suggest that the Sumerian ideal of shepherd kingship
was established in the Uruk Period (circa 4000 – 3000 B.C.) at the very
beginning of Sumerian history.
The shepherd kings of Uruk: Uruk was the first large city in Sumer
(and in the world) so it was literally the beginning of Sumerian civilization
(“civilization” is derived from the Latin word “civitas” meaning “city”).
Uruk and other Sumerian cities grew up around the first large temples in
the region, so the cities were originally administered by the high priests.
Later, as the city-states became more powerful and competitive, they were
ruled by kings who could better deal with the mundane, more down-to
earth matters of civic administration. Kings could also command large
armies to fight against other Sumerian cities and to guard against foreign
invasions. In the interim, according to the prevailing theory, after Uruk
was ruled solely by priests and before it was later ruled by kings, it was
governed by the “priest-kings”, so-named because they were often shown
The Kings of Uruk about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/507901.html
2 of 18 8/18/2020, 3:29 PM



performing both kingly and priestly duties.
A statue of the “priest-king” of Uruk, frontal and three-quarter
views. The statue is part of a matched set that is dated in the Uruk Period.
The nude statues are rendered in a very simple and abstract style (click
here to see a picture of both statues).
According to the Louvre, where the statues are kept, “On the head of the
priest-king is what seems to be a cap or headband” and the beard is
“continuous with the hair”. There are no striations on the top of the head
to show that it is hair, but then again, there are no striations on the beard
either. The simple abstract style of the figure makes it difficult to discern
the exact nature of his headdress. In many depictions of the priest-kings of
Uruk, one could argue that he is wearing a hat, or a headband, or a hat
with a band. I would suggest that it's a hat, and not a headband, for the
following reasons:
1) A headband is generally associated with the crown of an Akkadian king,
as seen on the statutes of Lamgi-Mari and Sargon. Sumer and Akkad were
two distinct countries that were often at war with each other, so it seems
unlikely that both the Sumerian and Akkadian kings would wear the same
kind of crown.
2) If a headband was the crown of the prototypical Sumerian king, it
seems that the same
crown would show up in other Sumerian cities, in other periods of history.
But there aren’t
The Kings of Uruk about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/507901.html
3 of 18 8/18/2020, 3:29 PM



any known examples of later Sumerian kings wearing a simple headband
as a crown,
not even in Uruk.
3) A headband wasn’t worn by Sumerian priests. Later portraits of
Sumerian priests were traditionally depicted in the same manner. They
were often nude, they poured libations from the same spouted pitchers,
and they didn’t wear any kind of headdress (as shown on an engraving, a
plaque, and the Vulture Stele). On the other hand, throughout Sumerian
history, a simple headband was usually the headdress of a female priestess
(see the priestess of Ninsun and the high priestess of Ur, to name just a
couple) but the headband is never shown on a male priest. It seems that if
the headband was the mark of a male priest, then some other examples
would have shown up in Uruk or elsewhere.
In light of the evidence, I propose a new theory about this statue of the
priest-king of Uruk.
I have never heard it mentioned before, but I would suggest that he wears
a shepherd’s hat with a domed top and a thick brim. It is not as elaborate
as the shepherd hats of Gudea and Ur-Namma, but it probably closely
resembled the rustic caps worn by ordinary shepherds. Early versions of
the shepherd hat, like this one, had brims that were thick but narrow.
Some other examples are shown on the seal impressions pictured below.
I also suggest that this "priest-king" is not a king at all, but just a priest,
because he is nude. The Louvre states, "This nakedness is probably
The Kings of Uruk about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/507901.html
4 of 18 8/18/2020, 3:29 PM



connected with the figure's participation in a particular ritual - most likely
a form of fertility cult." Although the priests are sometimes nude, it's not
fitting that a king be shown naked. It would be injurious to his gravitas. In
my opinion, the Uruk priest is not a priest-king until he put his clothes on.
For the sake of reference, the ruler of Uruk is a priest when he is shown
naked, he is a
priest-king when he wears the ceremonial netted skirt of Inanna, and he is
a king when he wears a regular skirt.
I would further suggest that the shepherd, which is clearly the model for
Sumerian kings, was originally the model for a priest. Like a true
shepherd, the priest gathers his flock (the people) at the temple and he
administers to their needs, which is why a priest is often referred to as a
shepherd in many religions of the world. The shepherd priest of Uruk
would later become a shepherd priest-king, who then became the
shepherd king − the ideal Sumerian king and the prototype for all other
Sumerian kings.
A priest-king of Uruk. The dome of his hat is very high, taller than
where the top of his head should be. The thick brim is pulled down low on
his forehead. There is a hatband incised above the brim. From this angle it
is obvious that he is wearing a hat...

...from this angle, it is not so obvious. Now his hair looks like a headband,
or he is wearing a stylized chignon, and the hat and the chignon are not
differentiated.
Drawing of a head (Uruk). The notch in the back is either a ribbon
used to tie his chignon − or the hat is lower in the back (like the one shown
above) and his chignon is below it. The artists of Uruk were not always
precise about delineating the beard from the hair, or the hair from the hat,
or the hat from the band. That is why there has been some debate about
the nature of his headdress. Fortunately, not many images of the priest
king are quite so ambiguous as this drawing and the statue shown above.
The shepherd hat is more obvious in a reconstruction based on the
surviving fragments, as shown below.

Early versions of the shepherd hat
looked like this. It was essentially a wool cap with a rolled brim. From this
angle, it is easy to see why the hat has been mistaken for a headband.

The Blau Monument from Uruk. The proto-writing on the Blau
Monument is not translatable and the purpose of the artifact isn’t known.
According to the British Museum, “The two stone tablets seem to form a
pair, though it is not
fully understood what they were used for, and what they mean. However,
it's widely accepted that they record a transaction in which land was
exchanged for various goods...“ The Blau Monument may “thus represent
an early form of Mesopotamian kudurru or boundary stone”.
It is said that the two parts of the Blau Monument belong together, but I
don't think this is true because the king is dressed differently on the
separate parts. Neither do I believe that the pieces are by the same artist,
or that the separate parts even belong in the same time period. Anyway,
I'll save that discussion for another webpage. In the meantime...

There are two views of the priest-king on the Blau Monument, as shown
above. On the left, he holds an unidentified object and he is clearly
wearing a shepherd hat. On the right, he presents a lamb or a goat,
perhaps as a sacrificial offering. The outline of the shepherd hat isn't very
obvious, but the notch on the back of his head that delineates the hat's
lower brim shows up better in an enlargement. Judging by the writing,
this part of the Blau Monument is much older than the part on the left,
and the above two pictures show how the brim of the hat became wider
over time until it resembled the later versions of the shepherd hat. The
narrowness of the brim in the early depictions of the Uruk king is probably
why his headdress is often mistaken for a headband rather than a hat.
It's not just the hat that identifies the Uruk king as a shepherd. He is also
involved in the
care and feeding of animals.

The shepherd king holds the branches of the Tree of Life while rams feed
on its eight-pointed rosettes. A lamb is shown in the background. The
rosettes were a sacred symbol for the Sumerians and the image of rams
feeding on the high branches became a common motif in ancient Sumer.

The shepherd king on a ceremonial barge. He has a sacred statue of a bull,
or a bull altar,
or maybe it’s just a bull, and the structure represents a pavilion in the
background
on the shore. Even when he’s on a boat, the shepherd king has an animal
with him.
So what’s with all the animals? Surely it’s not to show that the king is a
goodhearted person because he is kind to animals. Of course some of the
animal images could relate to his functions as a priest – feeding the sacred
flock, offering sacrifices, etc.; but other Sumerian kings, like all kings in
the ancient world, also had priestly duties. They are shown performing
religious rites, meeting with the gods, and dedicating new temples, but
they’re not constantly surrounded by animals the same way as the Uruk
king. The continuous presence of animals
in the iconography of the Uruk king is meant to establish his identity as a
The Kings of Uruk about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/507901.html

shepherd, as the guardian and protector of his flock, the people. Later
kings didn’t need the animal iconography to identify themselves as
shepherds. By then, the shepherd hat alone was enough to symbolize their
role as shepherd kings because this concept had already been established
long ago by the king of Uruk.
The Uruk king is the original shepherd king, so of course he wears a
shepherd hat.
With so many animals around him, it would be surprising if he didn't wear
a shepherd hat.
As to be expected, shepherd kings are mentioned in the Sumerian
historical records. The first reference to a shepherd king listed on the
CDLI is Urukagina, the king of Lagash, the same city as Gudea. This isn't
very surprising because Urukagina best exemplifies the concept of
Sumerian shepherd kingship (see Urukagina on this website). It is written
on a tag that once adorned a statue that is now missing. The tag states that
the goddess Baba bore Urukagina for the shepherdship of the nation.
What’s interesting is that the kings of Umma in this same period are also
called shepherds. Umma and Lagash were archenemies that had been at
war for generations (see War: Umma and Lagash) and yet both their kings
referred to themselves as shepherds. This means the concept of shepherd
kingship was already firmly established in all of Sumer.

A tag for a statue, stating "[The goddess] Baba, the grebe(?) of the Holy
City, URU-KA-gina
/ she bore for the shepherdship (of the nation) / is its name." CDLI

Urukagina was a king in the Early Dynastic IIIb period, circa 2360 B.C.,
which is about 650 years after the end of the Uruk period, and yet there
aren’t any references to shepherd kings during the interim years. It seems
that if the concept of shepherd kingship originated in the Uruk period,
then it would be mentioned somewhere in Sumerian writing during the
following
ED I and ED II periods. In other words, if shepherd kings were invented
in the Uruk period, then why aren't they mentioned until 650 years later?
There are a couple of very good reasons for this. First of all, very few
Sumerian artifacts have survived the erosion of time during the past 5,000
years. For instance, a quick check of the CDLI’s Mesopotamian Royal
Inscriptions (where written references to kings are shown) reveals zero
artifacts from the Uruk period and only one artifact from the following ED
I and ED II periods (2900 – 2700 B.C.). The ED IIIa period has just 23
entries, and then there is a big jump in the ED IIIb period (2500 – 2340
B.C.) with 1,135 entries.
A grand total of 1 written record (for the combined periods of Uruk, ED I
and ED II) highlights the second and most important reason why
shepherd kings do not appear in the earliest Sumerian writing. That’s
because Sumerian writing was still in the process of being invented. Proto
writing began in the Uruk period and it slowly developed during the ED I
and ED II periods. Needless to say, at first it was very crude and primitive.
It was almost indecipherable even to the Sumerians themselves, much less

to a modern Sumerologist. Early written Sumerian wasn’t well suited for
narrative writing (history, literature, mythology, etc.) which uses complex
language to express complicated ideas. It was mainly used for accounting,
which contains mostly nouns and numbers. Even so, many of the simplest
accounting tablets from this period remain untranslatable. That is why the
Blau Monument is still not translated 5,000 years after it was written.
So a king of Uruk could not issue a "press release", using the written word
to announce his policy of being a good shepherd to his people, and then
expect everyone to know about it. First of all, the written language wasn’t
suited for this purpose, and second, not many people could read it. So if he
wanted to get the idea across, he had to do it pictorially. That is why there
are so many images of him involved in the care and feeding of animals,
and that is why he wears a shepherd hat.
Pictorially, it's the hat and the presence of animals that clearly identifies
him as a shepherd. In lieu of writing, the best way for the king of Uruk to
portray himself as a shepherd king is to put on a shepherd's hat and
surround himself with animals.

beard or a chignon, but in two other important ways
he is just like the shepherd king of Uruk − he is surrounded by animals
and he wears a shepherd hat. This ED I artifact shows that the concept of
shepherd kings had already spread from Uruk to the rest of Sumer.
The Sumerian ideal of shepherd kingship spread throughout Mesopotamia
and it would last for many centuries after the Sumerians had passed into
history.
The ideal of shepherd kingship wasn't just a propaganda ploy used by the
Sumerian kings to cast themselves in a favorable light. It was a deeply
ingrained aspect of the Sumerian culture. In 2350 B.C. the Sumerians
were conquered by the Akkadians under Sargon the Great. The Akkadian
Empire would rule Sumer for the next two centuries. Properly considered,
this was the Sumerian Dark Ages. They were no longer in charge of their
own destiny and their own cultural identity. Two hundred years is a long
time to be a subject nation, but the Sumerians eventually regained their
independence and reconquered the Akkadians. They emerged from the
Dark Ages with their civilization still intact. After the dark ages comes the
renaissance. Now began the Neo-Sumerian Revival, the final flowering of
Sumerian civilization, led by Gudea and Ur-Namma, the shepherd kings.
The fact that the shepherd kings were around since the very beginning of
Sumerian civilization is of vital importance. The following explanation is
from The Shepherd Kings:
The Sumerian civilization developed early, when the rest of the world was
still living in the Stone Age. The Sumerians prospered even though they
didn't have many natural resources. They didn't have much mineral
wealth and they didn't have an abundant supply of wood. They didn't even
have a lot of stone (imagine the civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome
without their endless supply of stone). The Sumerians lasted for
thousands of years, even though they were surrounded by enemies.
I suggest there is one reason, and one reason alone, why the Sumerians
were the first to invent civilization, why they prospered even without
natural resources, and why they lasted
for as long as they did. It's because of the shepherd kings.
And it all began with the shepherd king of Uruk.

Ki-en-gi (Sumer).
In light of the evidence, I would like to propose a new theory about the
name of Sumer:
Proof that the shepherd kings had been around since the beginning of
Sumerian civilization can be found in the name of Sumer itself, ki-en-gi.
Ki means “land”, en means “lord”, and gi means “civilized”. Therefore, ki
en-gi means “Land of the Civilized Lords". En also means “priest”, so ki
en-gi could just as easily be read as "Land of the Civilized Priests".
Therefore, the name of Sumer may have arisen in the earliest stage of its
development, when it was ruled by the shepherd priests of the temples,
even before it was ruled by kings. Then again, the name may have

originated when the distinction between priest and king was still blurred,
i.e., when Sumer was ruled by the priest-kings. In either case, Sumer was
named for its form of government.
Today, it is not usual for a country to be named for its type of government.
The United States of America indicates it is a nation of semi-independent
states. Other examples include the Republic of Ireland, the Socialist
Republic of Vietnam, and so on. In ancient times, however,
a country was usually named for a people (France was named for the
Franks) or a region (China was named for the Chin (Qin) province). Sumer
is the only ancient country that was named for its government.
It was named for the shepherd priest/king of Uruk.

Enmetena, ruler of Lagash

A Sumerian king. He is standing before an offering table in a temple.
Across his shoulder he carries a shepherd's flail, a symbol of office. This
plaque is from a later period. There are no known images of Enmetena.
Enmetena was the ensi (ruler) of the Sumerian city of Lagash. He reigned
for 27 years, circa 2418 ‐ 2391 BC. He came from a long line of
distinguished kings. His father was Enannatum, his uncle was Eannatum,
the king of the first Sumerian empire in history. His great-grandfather
was Ur-Nanshe, the founder of the Lagash I dynasty.

En-mete-na/ ensi/ Lagash. Detail from a door socket from a temple. It
looks as if his name is spelled en-te-me-na (by which he was previously
known) but as pointed out by Bendt Alster, the middle two signs are a
ligature, two signs joined together and pronounced in reverse order.
For example, the Sumerian word for “king”, lugal, is also a ligature. It is
written as gal-lu2 (“great man”) but it is pronounced lu-gal.
Lugal. In Sumer, a king and an ensi were essentially
the same.
During his reign, Lagash was still one of the major powers in Sumer.
Enmetena exercised hegemony over the neighboring city-states of Uruk,
Larsa, and Badtibira. He could call upon conscript laborers from these
cities for his own building projects. In addition, he was also able
to maintain dominance over Lagash’s rival city of Umma.
An Enmetena foundation peg. Pegs like this were buried beneath the
foundations of
a new temple. On it, Enmetena proclaims his "brotherhood" with the king

states rather than
imposing his will on them by force. It is the mark of a true statesman that
he is able to
exercise authority to influence rather than to control.
Perhaps the best know artifact of Enmetena is
this silver vase dedicated to the god Ningirsu. See Enmetena Vase
for an enlarged picture, plus a translation of the inscriptions.
Enmetena built a new temple to Enlil, the E-adda (Temple of the Father)
and attempted to introduce the cult of Enlil to his subjects. Apparently the
attempt was unsuccessful, as no evidence is found that the cult existed in
later times. This is somewhat surprising because Enlil was the chief god of
the Sumerians; though it's probably because his subjects were
mostly devoted to Ningirsu, the god of war and the patron deity of the city,
Like all rulers of Lagash, Enmetena was a builder of great temples. He
built temples for Enlil, Enki, Nanshe, Ningirsu, Dumuzid, and other gods.
He also built dams and irrigation canals and planted orchards. Last but
not least, he built the Brewery of Ningirsu, which would certainly make his
subjects happy.
ama-gi4. Ama = mother, gi4 = return.
Unlike many other ancient kings, Enmetena showed a genuine concern for
the welfare of his citizens. He was the first Sumerian king to use the words
ama-gi. The literal translation for the signs is "return to mother". It
originally meant freedom from debt servitude, but it would later
come to mean “freedom” in general. One of his foundation cones

proclaims:
A remission of the obligations {ama-gi4} of Lagash he instituted.
He returned the mother to the child
and returned the child to the mother,
and a remission {ama-gi4} of interest-bearing barley loans he instituted ...
When he states that he “returned the mother to the child and returned the
child to the mother” it means he abolished the practice of indenturing
mothers and children as servants until the debts of the family were paid
off. The debts themselves were not abolished, only the
indentured servitude. Enmetena applied the same standard of justice to
the other cities under his control:
The citizens of Uruk, the citizens of Larsa, and the citizens of Badtibira,
a remission {ama-gi4} of the their obligations he instituted.
For a complete translation of this foundation tablet, see Enmetena Tablet.
Although Urukagina is usually considered to be the first reformist king in
history, some of the credit must also go to Enmetena. It has been shown
that Urukagina copied many of the reforms already enacted by Enmetena,
more than a generation before Urukagina's "Liberty Cones". See
Enmetena, not Urukagina on this website.
Enannatum, the father of Enmetena.
Like the rulers of Lagash before him, Enmetena had to guard against the
encroachments of the rival city of Umma. The two cities had been battling
for generations to control the fertile fields of the Guedena. Enmetena had
fought against Umma once before during the reign of

his father. He fought against Umma again after he became king in his own
right. He later
had to deal with a third incursion from Umma, which apparently he
resolved diplomatically
rather than resorting to war. The history of the wars with Umma is written
on one of his foundation cones. For a complete translation of this story,
along with some commentary,
see War: Umma and Lagash.
Enmetena was a credit to his ancestors Ur-Nanshe and Eannatum. He had
a long and successful reign. Enmetena was the last strong king of Lagash.
After his reign, the power and influence of Lagash began to decline
and the city was eventually conquered by Umma.

Mesalim, king of Kish.
Enlil, king of all the lands, father of all the gods,
by his righteous command, for Ningirsu and Shara,
demarcated the (border) ground.
Mesalim, king of Kish, by the command of Ishtaran,
laid the measuring line upon it, and on that place he erected a stele.
Here mythology and history become intertwined. Enlil was the chief
Sumerian god; Shara and Ningirsu were the patron gods of Umma and
Lagash respectively. The story is cast in religious overtones to suggest the
demarcation of the Guedena was sanctioned by the gods and the borders
were therefore inviolate. This was Lagash's point of view; Umma obviously
held a different opinion.
The war between Umma and Lagash had been going on for quite some
time before Mesalim was called upon to settle the dispute. As the king of
Kish, Mesalim had influence over the region and his word carried
considerable weight and authority. He apportioned
the land between the cities and a stele was erected at the border to
announce his decision. Then a trench was dug with earthen levees
on either side to separate the two territories. Nonetheless, Mesalim’s
arbitration did little to resolve the problem. Apparently his decision
greatly favored Lagash (the larger and more powerful of the two
cities) much to Umma’s lingering resentment. The wars would continue
unabated for more than a century.
Ush, "ensi" (ruler/king) of Umma.

Ush, ruler of Umma, something greatly beyond words(?) he did.
That stele he tore out, and into the plain of Lagash he entered.
Ningirsu, the hero of Enlil,
by his (Enlil's) just command, with Umma battle he did.
By the command of Enlil, he cast (his) big battle-net upon it,
and its many tumuli he laid upon the ground in the plain.
Ush was the first known ruler of Umma to violate the terms of the
treaty. He marched across the border and destroyed Mesalim’s stele. This
would happen many times during
the course of the war. Ush obviously predates Ur-Nanshe, Enmetena’s
great-grandfather
and the founder of the Lagash I dynasty. The victory is credited to
Ningirsu, the god of war,
and not to a specific ruler of Lagash. If Ur-Nanshe had been the victor in
the battle, then
Enmetena surely would have mentioned it. An inscription (CDLI 222390)
relates that
Ur-Nanshe battled with Umma (and its allied city of Ur) at some point
during his reign,
but the name of the king of Umma is Pabilgaltuku, not
Ush. Pabilgaltuku is probably
the son of Ush. The victory that is described above was won by ensi Lugal
sha-engur,
Ur-Nanshe’s predecessor. Lugal-sha-engur was the ensi
contemporary with Mesalim,
who presented him with a ceremonial mace head for the
temple of Ningirsu in the city
of Lagash. In any case, Enmetena wasn’t interested in glorifying
any dynasty but his own.
The many tumuli “laid upon the ground” were mass graves for the
enemy dead, piled high to emphasize the scope of the king’s victory.
Sometimes the tumuli were stacked so high that men had to climb ladders
to dump the baskets of dirt on top of the bodies.

Eannatum, ruler of
Lagash.
Eannatum, ruler of Lagash, uncle of Enmetena, ruler of Lagash,
with Enakale, the ruler of Umma, demarcated the (border) ground,
and its levee from the Princely Canal to the Gu'edena he extended.
Of Ningirsu's field 215 nindan he left under the control of Umma
and made it into a field with no owner.
On that levee steles he inscribed, and the stele of Mesalim he restored.
Into the plain of Umma he did not pass.
On the boundary mound of Ningirsu (named) Namnunda-kigara,
a dais of Enlil, a dais of Ninhursag, a dais of Ningirsu,
and a dais of Utu he constructed.
It seems as if Eannatum is concluding a treaty after the victory that’s
described in the previous section, but this is not the case. That victory is
credited to the gods, but Enmetena would have mentioned the fact if the
victory had been won by Eannatum, who was his uncle. This section refers
to Eannatum’s later victory over Umma, the one that’s depicted on the
Vulture Stele (see Vulture Stele Translation). Actually, at least one other
war was fought
with Umma prior to this one. Akurgal, son of Ur-Nanshe and the father of
Eannatum, lost some of the Guedena in an earlier war with Umma. The
fact that Akurgal had a short reign suggests he was killed in the war,
though this has not been proven. Even if true, Enmetena
would not acknowledge the fact, neither is it told on the Vulture
Stele. Royal monuments never mention defeat. This was one of only two
times in the history of the wars that Umma was victorious over Lagash.
The other time was about 50 years later, during the reign of
Enannatum II, who was the son of Enmetena and the last king of Ur
Nanshe’s dynasty.

Enakale, ruler of Umma.
Enakale was the new ruler of Umma with whom Eannatum demarcated
the new borders. Presumably the previous ruler was killed in the war with
Eannatum. A damaged portion of the inscriptions on the Vulture Stele
suggests the king of Umma was killed during the battle. “They shall raise a
hand against him, and in the heart of Umma they shall kill him. Usurdu,
by name [. . .]”. Usurdu is probably the name of the king of Umma,
and "they" are possibly Eannatum's soldiers. This might have been
Eannatum’s revenge for the death of his father. Another indication that
Usurdu is the name of the king of Umma is the fact that Enmetena
uses similar language at the end of this foundation cone. He declares a
malediction against any future king, any other "Man of Umma", who dares
to transgress upon Lagash's territory: "In the middle of his city may they
kill him!"
On the lower register of The Vulture Stele, Eannatum uses his spear to
strike an enemy in the face, who is drawn larger than the other men
to indicate his greater importance. This is probably the king of Umma, and
thus is symbolized his death, whether or not Eannatum personally killed
him in battle. Enkale then succeeded the dead king of Umma, but only
with Eannatum's approval.
Eannatum built large daises on his side of the border to show that the
treaty had the blessing of the gods and to demonstrate his permanent
ownership of the land. He set up
new steles and restored the stele of Mesalim, which will later be destroyed
(again)
in yet another war with Umma. Eannatum decreed that part of the
Guedena will be
“a field with no owner”, a kind of No Man’s Land. Enakale had to swear,
“by the life of Enlil,
king of heaven and earth, the fields of Ningirsu I shall exploit as an

interest-bearing loan”,
meaning that Umma could farm the fields for the payment of rent (a share
of the crops).
Eannatum probably thought he was being quite generous, considering the
fact that Umma
had lost the war, and that Enakale was lucky to have what he could get. On
the other hand, Enakale certainly found it galling to pay rent for land that
he considered to be rightfully
his own. Eannatum himself would simply shrug off the matter, “The ruler
of Umma,
when has he ever been appeased?”
Of the barley of Nanshe and the barley of Ningirsu,
one grain-heap measure (5184 hl.)
the Man of Umma consumed as an interest-bearing loan.
The share of the yield was imposed,
and 144,000 large grain-heap measures it had become.
The narrative has moved forward to the prelude of another war.
Eannatum and Enakale have both died. The "Man of Umma" is now Ur
luma, the son of Enakale. He owes a
payment for the grain that his city has consumed, grain that was grown in
the “field with
no owner” that is actually controlled by Lagash. Interest for the “loan” has
accrued, payable
as a “share of the yield”. The amount of interest due is difficult to ascertain
because of the
different units of measure named in the translation, but it is obviously
very high.
The stage has been set. The war will continue for another generation.
Ur-luma, ruler of Umma.

Because he was unable to repay that barley,
Ur-luma, ruler of Umma,
the levee of the boundary territory of Ningirsu
and the levee of the boundary territory of Nanshe
he removed with water.
To its steles he set fire, and he tore them out.
The daises of the gods, which on the Namnunda-kigara (mound)
had been constructed, he demolished.
He hired foreign countries,
and over the levee of the boundary territory of Ningirsu he crossed.
This is actually Ur-luma’s second attack on the border; the previous attack
is mentioned in the section below. He destroyed the daises of the gods that
Eannatum had built to show Lagash’s ownership of the land. The border
steles were once again destroyed, this time with fire. The steles were made
of limestone, so it's difficult to imagine how they were burned, but here's
how it probably happened: Wood was stacked around the steles and set
ablaze. If the fire became super hot, the steles would burst into flame
(limestone will actually burn if it's heated hot enough). Alternatively, the
fire heated the steles until they were red hot, then they were suddenly
doused with cold water to shatter them. The steles were also uprooted,
just for good measure. The levees of the boundary trench were washed
away with water, effectively erasing the border. This also made it easier for
Ur-luma’s army to pass over them. The army now included foreigners that
Ur-luma hired as mercenaries. The "foreigners" were
probably Kish/Akkadians, the Sumerians' northern neighbors. Enmetena
would be outraged that foreigners were hired to meddle in a Sumerian
"domestic dispute".

Lagash.

Enannatum, ruler of Lagash,
in the Ugiga field, the field of Ningirsu, had (previously) fought with him,
but Enmetena, the beloved son of Enannatum, defeated him.
Ur-luma fled into the middle of Umma and was killed.
His donkeys, sixty teams,
on the bank of the Lummagirnunta (canal) were left behind,
and their personnel's bones were all left out on the plain.
Their tumuli in five places he heaped up.
While Eannatum was still alive, Ur-luma did not dare to attack him
because Eannatum was too powerful and too great a warrior. On the death
of Eannatum, the kingship passed to his brother Enannatum, the father of
Enmetena. At the time, Enannatum had his hands full trying to quell the
many rebellions in different parts of his dead brother's crumbling empire.
This is when Ur-luma decided to attack.
The first battle occurred in the Ugiga fields. An Enannatum tablet
(CDLI 222496) tells us that Ur-luma “by the Hill of the Black Dog brought
up his vanguard” (what a perfect place
to have a battle, “by the Hill of the Black Dog”). Ur-luma was defeated and
fled the battle
with Enannatum hot on his heels. The tablet relates how Enannatum "did
smite" Ur-luma all the way back to the levee of the border territory of
Ningirsu. Then Ur-luma came to the Lumma‐girnunta canal, which
blocked his retreat. Ur-luma plunged into the canal
in his haste to get away. Enannatum “in the ... of the Lumma-girnunta
canal went after him,
and his outer garment he put all over(?) him.” This suggests Enannatum
actually grabbed
Ur-luma’s cloak before Ur-luma managed to free himself and escape.
It shows how close
Ur-luma came to being captured.
Enannatum died soon afterward. Because of the shortness of his reign
(about 7 years) it’s been speculated that Enannatum was killed in the
battle just described. This, however, seems unlikely because he is known
to be alive at the very end of the battle. Of course he could have been killed
in the final skirmish to capture Ur-luma, but it’s far more likely that
he later died of natural causes due to his age. By this time Enannatum was
The Sumerian "Hundred Years War" about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/72401.html

at least
50 years old, quite elderly by the standards of the ancient world. The
rulership of Lagash
now passed to his son Enmetena.
The above section also describes the second battle, with the same
disastrous results for Ur-luma. Once again he had to beat a hasty retreat,
this time with Enmetena in hot pursuit. Once again he was blocked by the
same Lumma-girnunta canal. Once again he just barely
managed to escape. He had to abandon 60 teams of chariot donkeys (with
four per team, that’s 240 donkeys, a large number by Sumerian
standards), plus their personnel, plus the other soldiers left behind to
cover his retreat, not to mention the soldiers unlucky enough
to be stranded on the wrong side of the canal when Enmetena's army fell
upon them. Some historians state that the donkeys were slaughtered, but
it wasn’t the donkeys that were slaughtered, it was the soldiers. The
chariot donkeys were very expensive and highly prized. They would
later pull the chariots of Enmetena’s victorious army. As for the enemy
soldiers, their bodies were heaped into five tumuli and left out on the
plain.
“Ur-luma fled into the middle of Umma and was killed.” Notice how
Enmetena doesn’t claim that he killed Ur-luma. If he did kill Ur-luma, he
surely would have bragged about it.
Instead, Ur-luma had escaped and he was in the middle of Umma when he
was killed, or
assassinated, to be more precise.
Like Darius in his infamous flight from Alexander the Great 2,000 years
later, Ur-luma was probably murdered by someone in his own entourage.
Not only did he lose two battles,
but he disgraced himself by running away like a coward. He therefore no
longer had the
respect of his soldiers and his subjects. Ur-luma thus met the same fate
as many other
failed kings in the ancient world. Given the way things turned out, Ur
luma should have
done himself a favor by allowing himself to be heroically killed in battle.

Enmetna, ruler of
Lagash.
At that time, Il {as in "ill"}, who was the temple administrator of
Zabalam,
from Girsu to Umma in retreat(?) he marched.
Il the rulership of Umma seized.
It is said that Il “seized” the kingship of Umma, as if were a coup
d’état. This how Enmetena saw the matter, but it's not entirely correct. Ur
luma was succeeded by
his brother E'andamu'a, who died after a brief reign and was succeeded by
his son Il,
who was Ur-luma's nephew. Though it's entirely possible that Ur-luma
was assassinated by
his own brother (such a thing happened more than once in the ancient
world), a more likely explanation is that Ur-luma was murdered by
someone else, and his brother succeeded him because Ur-luma had no
sons to inherit his crown. On the other hand, perhaps Enmetena is
intimating that Il killed his own father to inherit the kingship (again, such
a thing happened more than once in the ancient world, calling to mind the
saying by William Shakespeare, "Uneasy lies the head that wears the
crown."). This might have been Enmetena's attempt at
propaganda, to portray Il in a sinister light. In any case, as will soon
become apparent, Il had his own plans about the next war with Lagash.
The levee of the boundary territory of Ningirsu,
the levee of the boundary territory of Nanshe,
and the boundary mound of Ningirsu
which was located on the of bank of the Tigris in the region of Girsu,
the Namnunda-kigara of Enlil, Enki, and Ninhursag,
he removed with water.

The barley of Lagash, one grain-heap measure, he repaid.
Il, ruler of Umma.
Il made only a token payment for the grain that he owed to Lagash. He
then commenced hostilities by marching into Lagash’s territory and
destroying the levees of Nanshe and Ningirsu, just as his predecessors had
done. The Namnunda-kigara, the boundary mound built by Eannatum,
then destroyed by Ur-luma, and restored by Enmetena, was again
destroyed by washing it away with water.
When Enmetena, ruler of Lagash,
because of those levees, to Il had sent envoys,
Il, ruler of Umma, the stealer of fields, speaking hostilely,
“The levee of the boundary territory of Ningirsu and the
levee of the boundary territory of Nanshe are mine!” he declared.
“From the Antasura (temple) to the temple of Dimgalabzu
I shall remove the earth from them!” he declared.
This seems to be an uncharacteristically mild response from Enmetena.
Why did Enmetena send his envoys instead of his armies? Il had refused
to repay the grain he owed, then marched into Lagash’s territory,
destroyed the boundary levees, destroyed the daises of the holy gods, and
made threats to the sacred Antasura temple. All of these actions were
deliberate acts of war, so why didn’t Enmetena pounce on Il? This is what
his predecessors would have done. Il, the “stealer of fields”, is allowed to
get away with it?
We can only speculate on Enmetena’s reasons for not going to war.
Perhaps he had other pressing matters at home; perhaps his treasury was
empty, or he had another war on another front that needed attending to.
Perhaps he was merely sick of war and hoped to resolve the problem
diplomatically.
But Enlil and Ninhursag did not allow him this. {i.e., not allow Il to sieze

Lagash's territory}
Enmetena, ruler of Lagash, nominated by Ningirsu,
by the just command of Enlil, the just command of Ningirsu,
and the just command of Nanshe,
that levee from the Tigris River to the Princely Canal he constructed.
The Namnunda-kigara's base he built with stones for him,
and for his master who loved him, Ningirsu,
and his mistress who loved him, Nanshe,
he restored it.
Notice how the Namnunda-kigara, the dais of the gods built by
Eannatum and destroyed twice before, is now rebuilt with stone so it
couldn’t easily be washed away with water.
As no battle is mentioned, it seems that Enmetena was successful at
resolving the situation diplomatically without resorting to weapons,
though it's somewhat anticlimactic. Now we are left wondering, why did Il
back down? He had escalated the situation to the very brink of war, now
he silently folds his tents and goes back home? Again we can only
speculate. When he assumed power after the ineffectual Ur-luma, Il
probably made a lot of bellicose statements about “teaching Lagash a
lesson”. Perhaps Enmetena made enough concessions so that Il could
return home without losing face and claim a diplomatic victory.
Perhaps the new king suddenly realized he needed to strengthen his home
front before he attempted another battle with Lagash. One thing is for
certain, however; this wasn’t the last that would be heard of Il. He was
simply biding his time.
Enmetena, ruler of Lagash, given the scepter by Enlil,
given wisdom by Enki, chosen by the heart of Nanshe,
chief ruler of Ningirsu,
the man who held fast to the commands of the gods,
may his (personal) god Shul-mush{x}pa
for the life of Enmetena unto distant days
before Ningirsu and Nanshe stand (interceding) for him!

Enmetena, ensi of Lagash.
Enmetena’s foundation cone ends with an invocation to the gods and a
warning to anyone
who dared trespass on his territory:
A Man of Umma
who, over the levee of the boundary territory of Ningirsu
or over the levee of the boundary territory of Nanshe
in order by violence to take fields might (in the future) cross,
whether he be a man of Umma or a man of a foreign land,
may Enlil annihilate him!
Ningirsu, when his big battle-net he has cast over him,
his great hands and great feet may he bring down (upon him) from
above!
When the people in his city have raised a hand against him,
in the middle of his city may they kill him!
Enmetena was mistaken if he thought his kingdom was secure in the
protection of the gods. After his death, Il would launch an attack against
Enmetena’s son, Enannatum the Second, the last king of Ur-Nanshe’s
dynasty, and seize control of the Guedena. It was the first time
in more than a generation that Umma was victorious over Lagash.
Thereafter, Umma was in the ascendency and Lagash was on the decline.
The final culmination of the wars between Umma and Lagash occurred a
generation later, when Lugalzagesi, another “Man of Umma”, sacked and
burned the city of Lagash. The heyday of Umma would be brief, however.

Soon afterward, Umma, Lagash, and the rest of Sumer was conquered by
the Akkadians under Sargon the Great. Only then did the two cities stop
fighting each other. It would be almost two centuries before Sumer was
liberated from the Akkadians. By then, Umma and Lagash had finally
learned to live in peace.

were repaid. The word would later be used to mean "freedom" in general.

Enmetena, not Urukagina
9-11 minutes
This is a translation of an important tablet that is mistakenly thought to
belong to Urukagina.
The tablet is heavily damaged and the name of the king who
commissioned it is missing, but it's assumed to be Urukagina's because it
has much of the same language and content as his foundation cones. I
would suggest, however, that the tablet actually belongs to Enmetena,
who reigned as a ruler of Lagash a generation before Urukagina. Evidence
for this is the fact that the tablet tells the story of a battle with Ur-luma,
the ruler of the rival city of Umma. This is the same story told on an
Enmetena foundaion cone (CDLI 222532, see Enmetena Cone
Enmetena, not Urukagina about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/76101.html
1 of 7 8/18/2020, 3:32 PM



on this website). It uses the exact same imagery of Ur-luma's sixty teams
of donkeys (that were used to pull war chariots) abandoned next to the
Lumma-girnunta canal, along with the bones of their slain personnel.
This tablet is important for several reasons. First, it shows that many of
the social injustices that Urukagina complains about on his foundation
cones had existed earlier, during the time of Enmetena, and that
Enmetena made similar efforts to correct them. The "Liberty Cones" of
Urukagina are generally regarded to be the first documented effort at
social reforms, but now some of the credit must go to Enmetena's earlier
attempts. It also demonstrates the need for constant vigilance in battling
social injustice. Even if Enmetena's corrective measures proved
to be successful, over time the problems resurfaced because the root
causes never go away.
Second, this tablet shows Urukagina's indebtedness to Enmetena for the
tone and content of his Liberty Cones. Urukagina uses many of the same
specific examples found on this tablet, e.g., the seizure of the fisheries of
poor people, the conscription of blind workers to dig the irrigation ditches
in the fields of the officials, the taking of the best land by the ensi and his
use of temple oxen to plow his fields, the high cost of religious rituals, etc.
Doubtlessly many other matching examples could be found except for the
fact that most of this tablet is missing due to damage. Urukagina also
used some of the same phrases that are found of this tablet: "The oxen of
the gods the garlic plots of the ruler did plow, and the best fields ...", and
"The lustration priests measured the grain tax in Ambar." Again, more
phrases would surely be found except for the heavily damaged condition of
the tablet. Because of its similarity in the tone and content with the
Liberty Cones, it's easy to see why this tablet was mistakenly
thought to belong to Urukagina (for comparison purposes, read a
complete translation of Urukagina's Liberty Cones.)
Third, and most important, the tablet is universally cited by historians as
proof that Urukagina passed a decree against polyandry, the marriage
of one woman to several men at the same time. As a demonstration of
these erroneous citations, do an Internet search on Urkagina + polyandry
and you will get hundreds of relevant hits. If you make a search on
Enmetena (or Entemena, as he was formerly known) + polyandry you will
get no relevant hits at all. The intention of the decree isn't exactly clear,
Enmetena, not Urukagina about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/76101.html

but even so, the decree will have to be ascribed to Enmetena, not
Urukagina. See Note at the end of the translation.

tablet.

Note: As translated, the line "As for women of former times, two of them
a male could marry" could be interpeted as meaning polygyny (the
marriage of one man to multiple women) rather than polyandry (the
marriage of one woman to multiple men). However, the correct
translation of the line is, "As for women of former times, two men each
could marry." The transliteration of the relevant lines are as follows:
20'. munus u4-bi-ta-ke4-ne
As for women of former times,
21'. nita 2(asz@c)-ta
two of them a male
22'. i3-tuku-am6
could marry.
23'. munus u4-da-e-ne
But for women of today
24'. za-asz2-da-bi i3-szub
the indemnification of it has been abandoned.
According to John Alan Halloran's Sumerian Lexicon, the suffix -ta when
applied to numbers denotes "each", so line 21 should read "two men each".
The translation of za-asz2-da as "indemnification" is also somewhat
misleading. According to the Sumerian Lexicon, a more accurate
translation would be "crime", so "the crime of it (polyandry) has been
abandoned". It's not exactly clear if the practice has been outlawed
(because no penalty is assigned for it) or if the practice died out on its
own, if indeed it was ever much of a problem.
Even if another tablet by Urukagina was found that mentioned polyandry,
it would only prove that he copied it from Enmetena, just as he copied
other parts of this tablet. In the meantime, the decree against
polyandry must now be ascribed to Enmetena, not Urukagina.

Urukagina, reformist king
13-17 minutes
A Sumerian king. There are no known images of Urukagina. This terra
cotta figure is from the city of Ur and is dated in a later period. The
king carries a shepherd's flail, a symbol of authority, and he stands before
an offering table. He wears a shepherd's hat, the crown of a Sumerian
king.
Urukagina reigned for seven years in the city of Lagash, sometime around
2375 B.C. (Sumerian dates are never very certain). The pronunciation of
his name is Uru-ka-gina,
though he is also known as Iri-ka-gina and Uru-inim-gina. His signature is

shown at the bottom of the page. As the ensi (ruler, governor) of the city of
Lagash, he followed a long line of powerful monarchs that began with Ur
Nanshe and continued for several generations with Eannatum and
Enmetena. During recent years, however, the power and prestige of
Lagash seemed to be on the decline.
Urukagina may not have been of royal descent, since he did not assume
the rulership by the normal means of royal succession and he never signed
himself as dumu, "son of", which seems to indicate his father was not a
high-ranking nobleman with a title worth mentioning. It has also been
suggested that Urukagina's wife Shasha was a commoner because her
brother was a "chief herdsman", an official in charge of livestock.
However, this title was sometimes held by members of the minor nobility.
She nonetheless became the administrator of the temple of the goddess
Bau (Ba-u, or Baba) which employed more than 1,000 workers.
This suggests she was educated, and thus a member of the nobility. Many
of her administrative tablets from the temple have survived to the present
day.
(Temple of) Bau/ Shasha/ wife of Urukagina.
Urukagina’s immediate predecessor was ensi Lugalanda, who had a
reputation for greed and corruption. Lugalanda seized control of the most
important temples, those of the gods Ningirsu and Shulshagana and the
goddess Bau. He placed them under the administration
of an official that he appointed who was not, as formerly the case, a priest.
Lugalanda also appointed himself, his wife Baranamtarra, and other
family members, as administrators of the temples. He referred to the
temples as the private property of the ensi. He no longer mentioned the
names of deities in temple documents and he levied taxes on the
Urukagina, reformist king about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/77001.html
2 of 11 8/18/2020, 3:33 PM



priesthood.
Lugalanda and his wife became the largest landholders in the region. His
wife shared in the ensi’s power, managing her own private estates and
those of the Bau temple. She sent diplomatic missions to neighboring
states and she bought and sold slaves.
(source: "The Creation of Patriarchy", by Gerda Lerner)
Tensions between the ensi and the community increased. On his
foundation cones (below) Urukagina describes the prevailing conditions
for the common people. Their boats were
seized by the chief of the boatmen. Their sheep were appropriated by the
head herdsman, and their fish stores were confiscated by the fisheries
inspector. The “men of the ensi”
cut down the orchards of the poor and they conscripted workers to labor
in their fields.
Court officials were “everywhere”. The ensi took the best land for himself
and used the
sacred oxen from the temples to plow his fields. The temple officials were
also greedy
and corrupt. They charged excessive fees to perform their religious rituals
and to bury
the dead. They took bribes, levied onerous taxes which they shared with
the ensi, and they likewise used the temple oxen to plow their fields.
Although these conditions had existed
to some degree since time immemorial (“from distant days”) they seemed
to become
much worse during the reign of Lugalanda.
Lugalanda reigned for less than 6 years before Urukagina seized power.
The fact that Lugalanda’s son Urtarsirsira is known to be alive a year later
indicates that it was not a bloody coup d'état. This by itself was a notable
break with ancient tradition. Usually,
a deposed monarch and his sons were executed, thus ending any
pretensions they had about reclaiming the throne. In seizing power,
Urukagina claimed he was acting on behalf of boatmen, shepherds,
fisherman and farmers, and he implied he was aided by the priests.
The priesthood of Lagash had always been very influential, but if the
temple officials thought they were playing the role of “king maker” by
bringing Urukagina to power, they would later have cause to regret it.

Urukagina, ensi of Lagash.
The examples of cuneiform writing on this page are from tablets
and from clay "tags" that were used to identify various statues.
The statues themselves were destroyed long ago in the many wars that
occurred in the region.
Ensi Urukagina soon set about making some changes. He dismissed many
corrupt officials, the chief boatmen, head herdsmen and fishery inspectors
who had seized private property.
He confiscated the estates of the ensi and placed them under the
jurisdiction of the gods
(i.e., the temples). Urukagina removed many court officials, including
supervisors who controlled the grain tax. He dismissed the priests who
had taken bribes and the temple administrators who had shared tax
revenues with the ensi. Then Urukagina set limits on the amount that the
priests could collect for their religious rituals and their fees for burying the
dead. He cancelled debt‐slavery and declared a general amnesty for the
citizens of Lagash, even for criminals, even for thieves and murderers
(“their prison he cleared out”). Last but not least, he provided
charity for the poor and the elderly. In all of these actions Urukagina
claimed he was directed by the gods.
The goddess Bau confirms the commands given
by Urukagina.

All of these reforms were carefully recorded on Urukagina’s cones and
tablets to ensure that “the orphan or widow to the powerful will not be
subjugated”. Urukagina's “Liberty Cones”
are the world’s first documented effort to establish the basic legal rights of
citizens. Some
of the credit must go to Enmetena’s earlier efforts at reform (see
Enmetena Translation),
but Urukagina’s reforms are far more comprehensive. There's nothing else
like them
in the annals of ancient history. Unfortunately, they don’t get the credit
they truly deserve,
even though in the evolution of human society they are just as important
as the legal codes
of Ur-Namma or Hammurabi, the Magna Carta, or the American Bill of
Rights.
(See a complete translation of the Liberty Cones, along with some
explanatory comments.)
One of Urukagina’s “Liberty Cones”. The cone was covered with
inscriptions written to the gods, then buried near the foundations of a new
temple.
Some historians like to portray Urukagina as a leader of a populist
revolution in which freemen battled against the aristocracy and wealthy
landowners. But Urukagina’s reforms went only so far; he was merely
trying to correct the worst abuses of power, he wasn’t trying to overturn
the basic structures of society. Other historians like to emphasize his role
in transitioning the Sumerians from a “temple economy”, where the
temples were the administrative centers of government, to a modern
secular society based on royal power. In this regard he would be like an

ancestor of Henry the VIII, in the age old struggle between
church and state; but Urukagina wasn’t an anti-religious revolutionary or
an iconoclast. The estates that he confiscated from the ensis he gave to the
temples. Still other historians point to his claim of working on behalf of
the gods to right the wrongs of society as a self-justifying assertion of the
divine right of kings, but this ground had already been covered by his
predecessors, Eannatum and Enmetena, for instance. Although there's no
reason to doubt the sincerity of his efforts, the simple result of his
reformations was more power for himself. Evidence for this is found in the
second year of his reign, when Urukagina changed his title
from ensi (“ruler or governor”, which the monarchs of Lagash usually
called themselves)
to the loftier title of lugal, meaning “king”.
Urukagina, king of Lagash.
There has been some speculation on whether or not Urukagina enacted his
reforms into law or if he was just paying lip service to social reform as a
way to increase his popularity with his subjects (many kings announce
high-minded reforms at the beginning of their reigns, only to proceed with
“business as usual”). With Urukagina there can be little doubt as to his
intentions. He repeated his reforms on other foundation cones. The
reforms were the central event of his reign, and they would end up costing
him dearly, as will later be shown. As for whether or not he enacted the
reforms into law: Urukagina was the king, his word was law. This alone
was enough to guarantee that the reforms were enacted.

Watch on the wall/ of the temple E-barbar/
Urukagina/ king/ of Lagash.
These social reforms weren't his only concern. He ruled during a period of
political instability and civil war between the Sumerian city-states. His
main antagonist was Lugalzagesi,
the king of Umma who was making a bid to conquer all of Sumer and
Akkad (and beyond). Lugalzagesi made several attacks on the kingdom of
Lagash. One administrative tablet from this period is dated “the month
that the man of Uruk came a third time”. It seems like Lagash was under
repeated attacks from two different cities, Umma and Uruk, but in this
case they are essentially the same. Although Lugalzagesi was originally the
king of Umma, he had
recently moved his capital to Uruk, so “the man of Umma”, as he’s called
on another tablet,
and “the man of Uruk”, both refer to Lugalzagesi. Umma and Uruk would
be allies in the war
against Urukagina, since both cities were ruled by Lugalzagesi.
Three (or more) attacks on Urukagina within the span of seven years is a
bit much, even by the Sumerian standards of internecine warfare. The
reason for this was the long standing animosity between Umma and
Lagash. They were at war for more than a century, battling
for control of the Guedena, the fertile land between the two cities.
Although Lugalzagesi was

currently 'the Man of Uruk', he was born and raised as a royal prince of
Umma. As such, he would have grown up hating Lagash and dreaming of
the day when he could defeat it.
The Sumerian Hundred Years War was about to culminate into its final
battle.
Urukagina was focused on his social reformations. He wasn't interested in
foreign wars abroad or Sumerian civil wars at home. Nonetheless,
although social reforms were Urukagina's primary concern, he spent most
of his time defending his kingdom.

into submission. The prolonged siege of
the city caused the enemy “dogs” (soldiers) to live there for a while.
The goddess Bau soothes the heart of Urukagina.
Urukagina’s social reforms now came back to haunt him. He had
thoroughly alienated the aristocracy, who highly resented any reduction of
their royal prerogatives, even in the slightest degree. Throughout the ages,
the aristocracy has always been the military class. They justified their
privileged lifestyle by bringing their armies of peasants to the battlefield
when summoned by the king, by being recklessly brave in combat, and by
dying heroically in defense of the realm. Many a king in history has
suffered tragedy and downfall after alienating his aristocracy. Urukagina
was no exception. Now, when he needed them most, he could not rely on
his lords and noblemen. Their defense of his kingdom would be lukewarm
at best. They may have even refused to defend him, or with a few bribes
and blandishments they could easily be persuaded to switch sides. It
didn't help matters much that Urukagina had also alienated the clergy.
All this is proven by the fact that Lagash eventually lost the war with
Umma. This had seldom happened. Through generations of conflict,
under the leadership of Ur-Nanshe, Eannatum, and Enmetena, Lagash
had always been the victor and Umma the vanquished. Now, under the
leadership of Urukagina, bereft of effective military support from his
disgruntled nobility because of his social reforms, the roles had been
reversed. Lugalzagesi, “the Man of Umma”, thoroughly sacked the city of
Lagash, as if to avenge a century of humiliating defeats. The
savagery of the attack, especially the looting of the temples, shocked the
Sumerians. Sumerian civil wars were usually a lot more “civilized”. (See
“The Man of Umma” for a translation of a tablet detailing Lugalzagesi’s
plundering of Lagash.)

A letter from the high priest Lu-enna
addressed to the king of Lagash, believed to be Urukagina, informing him
that his son had been killed in combat.
Urukagina survived the sacking of Lagash and moved his capital to the
smaller neighboring city of Girsu. He was still a king, but his kingdom
was considerably reduced. Lugalzagesi followed him to Girsu and twice
besieged the city. Soon afterward, Urukagina disappears from
the historic record.
Urukagina, king of Girsu.
It’s not know for certain how he died, but the possibilities are endless.
Perhaps he died of
natural causes. Perhaps he was captured and executed, or killed himself
rather than being
taken alive. Perhaps he was murdered by an unseen assassin in a palace
coup by someone
trying to curry favor from Lugalzagesi. Hopefully he died in combat,
in one last heroic battle,
in defense of his kingdom and his vision of a better world.

The man of Umma
4-5 minutes
This a tanslation of a tablet (CDLI 222618), written after the reign of
Urukagina,
the king of Lagash, describing the misdeeds of Lugalzagesi, the king of
Umma,
in the war between them. The events occurred during Lugalzagesi's
attempt to
conquer all of Sumer and Akkad.

The front of the tablet is shown above. The back is shown below. Click
here to see the original line-drawing of both sides of the tablet.
The unusual thing about this tablet is that it has the rounded shape of an
accounting tablet rather than the square shape commonly associated with
historical or literary writing.
The repetition of the story is deliberate. It is meant to sound like a litany
of the crimes committed by Lugalzagesi.
Although Lugalzagesi was originally the ruler of Umma, he had moved his
capital to the city of Uruk. When this tablet was written, he
called himself "the King of Uruk". On this tablet, he is pointedly called
"the Man of Umma". Lagash and Umma had been at war for generations.
The writers of Lagash often called an Ummaite king the "Man of Umma"
as a way of saying "the enemy". Rather than calling Lugalzagesi by his
rightful title, the King of Uruk, the scribe calls him the Man of Umma, as if
to say, "Once an Ummaite, always an Ummaite." There is some bitterness
and contempt in the title.

Sumerian writer would be so sacrilegious.

I was convinced that the meaning was: for the sake of Nisaba, let the sin
be borne on the neck of Lugalzagesi, since his crimes are a disgrace to her.
Then I noticed "ke4", which is
the sign written after her name. Ke4 means "of" or possessive, so
a possible translation is "the sin of Nisaba" or "Nisaba's sin", implicating
her in the crimes of Lugalzagesi, since
she is the patron goddess of his city. If this was indeed the writer's intent,
it shows just how bitter he is toward Lugalzagesi for the destruction of
Lagash. Hopefully the writer later recanted his blasphemy, because Nisaba
is the goddess who invented writing and the patron deity of the scribes, so
it's unlikely that she had anything to do with the destruction of
anyone's city.

Lugalzagesi
13-16 minutes
A Sumerian king. There are no known images of Lugalzagesi.
Lugalzagesi came to power as the ensi (ruler) of Umma, a title he inherited
from his father,
U-u. He was also the high priest of Nisaba, the patron goddess of the city.
The current pronunciation of his name is Lugal-za-ge-si, with many
alternative spellings, including Lugalzaggessi and Lugalzaggisi. The

Sumerian signs for his name are shown below.
He unified the Sumerians under his rule and conquered many foreign
countries.
He called himself “the king of all nations”. “All those on thrones in Sumer
and the rulers
of foreign lands” acknowledged him as their king. Lugalzagesi ruled for
25-34 years
(depending on which version of the King List is correct) in the mid 24th
century B.C.
He was the last king of Sumer before it was conquered by Sargon and the
Akkadians.
Lugal-za3-ge-si
Lugalzagesi conquered the Sumerian cities of Ur, Larsa, Girsu, Lagash,
and possibly others, and eventually brought all the other cities of Sumer
under his control. Lugalzagesi is sometimes credited with being the first
king to unite the numerous city-states of Sumer
into a single nation, but this distinction must really go to several earlier
kings.
This in no way diminishes the accomplishments of Lugalzagesi. Each of
the city-states
had a proud tradition of independence dating back through the centuries.
They jealously
guarded their autonomy and their own self-interests, and were often at
war with each other.
In this way, Sumerian history resembles that of ancient Greece, where the
rivalry and
independence of the city‐states prevented Greece from ever becoming
more than the sum
of its parts. Most efforts to unite the Sumerian city-states had ended in
failure, and periods
of Sumerian unity had always been brief. After the death of the king who
had unified them,
the many city-states would once again go their own separate ways. Only a
strong king like Lugalzagesi could unite the cities of Sumer, and it speaks
well to his powers of kingship

that he was able to hold them together for as long as he did. It would be
more than
200 years later, during the Neo-Sumerian Revival, at the very end of
Sumerian history,
before Sumer once again became a unified nation.
Lugalzagesi, ensi of Umma.
Lugalzagesi’s efforts at unification sometimes carried a heavy price. His
war with Urukagina, the king of Lagash, was especially bitter (described
on the "Urukagina" page). Lugalzagesi had to besiege Lagash, and the
neighboring city of Girsu, three times before they finally fell. Once inside
the cities, his soldiers sacked them with a ferocity that shocked the
Sumerians. This kind of brutality was seldom seen in Sumerian warfare.
They conducted their civil wars according to the rules of 'civilized' warfare,
but Girsu and Lagash were treated like they were foreign cities. The
plundering of the temples was particularly appalling to the Sumerians,
who were a very religious people. A tablet that was written after the fall of
Lagash describes a litany of transgressions, “To the Antasura temple he set
fire, and its silver and lapis lazuli he bundled off. The palace of Tirash he
plundered, the Smaller Abzu he plundered, the dais
of Enlil and the dais of Utu he plundered. The Ahush he plundered, and its
silver and
lapis lazuli he bundled off...” (The Man of Umma). The violent sacking of
the city and the
sacrilegious looting of the temples has always condemned Lugalzagesi in
the judgment
of history.

Without excusing his actions, a word must be said in his defense. First,
according to the established rules of ancient warfare: the longer a city held
out, the worse its fate when it finally fell. If a city surrendered quickly it
could expect some leniency. On the other hand,
if a city resisted for a long time, costing the king more money and the lives
of his men,
then the consequences were always much worse when the city was taken.
For instance,
the medieval Europeans, who were much practiced in the art of siege
warfare, developed
a precise timetable of escalating consequences for each stage of a city’s
resistance;
ranging from fair and honorable treatment if the city surrendered quickly,
to heavy fines and
indemnities, to the plundering of the civilian population, to sacking and
burning the city
if it had resisted for too long. It must be remembered that Lugalzagesi had
to besiege
Lagash and Girsu three times before he conquered them; so his soldiers,
who had seen
many of their comrades killed in the attacks, were in no mood for mercy
when they finally
broke through. Lugalzagesi himself would have considered the silver and
lapis lazuli that he “bundled off” to be fair payment for his expenses.
His harsh treatment of Lagash also had
a calculated psychological effect. It sent a clear message to the
other Sumerian cities:
“This is what happens to cities that defend themselves too heroically”,
thus inducing them
to a quick surrender.
It's possible that many of the Sumerian cities that Lugalzagesi allegedly
"conquered"
gave up without a fight after they saw what happened to Lagash.
Second, there’s another reason why Lugalzagesi treated Lagash the way he
did. Umma,
his native city, and Lagash had been at war for more than a century. They
battled to control the Guedena, the fertile plain that lay between the two
Lugalzagesi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/80701.html

cities. The original border had been demarcated by Mesalim, the king of
Kish, who was called upon to settle the dispute. His ruling was favorable to
Lagash, the larger and more powerful of the two cities. Steles were
erected to mark their respective territories, but Umma had never been
happy with the ruling. As a result, the army of Umma often marched
across the border and “smashed to bits” the offending steles. A war
inevitably followed, and Umma was inevitably defeated (with only two
exceptions in the course of a hundred years). Then a heavy fine (in the
form of an interest-bearing “loan” of grain) would be levied against
Umma. In effect, Umma became a vassal city of Lagash. Umma often
couldn't repay the loan or the accrued interest, so its army would
again march across the border and re-smash the re-built steles. It was an
impotent gesture; the army never occupied the territory for long. This
would provoke another war; and so the cycle continued, for generations on
end, and Umma always lost. One has to sympathize with Umma, which
was always beaten down by the city of Lagash. It’s therefore not surprising
that when Lugalzagesi got the chance he thoroughly sacked Lagash, thus
avenging a century of humiliating defeats. There’s no evidence that
Lugalzagesi treated the other cities this way, so it’s not indicative of the
way he ruled his kingdom.
King of Uruk.
At some point during his reign Lugalzagesi made Uruk his capital city. It’s
often stated that he conquered the city, but this is unlikely. Lugalzagesi
claimed he was "the servant raised by the goddess Ningirim, queen of
Uruk”, suggesting he had a previous connection to the city,
possibly during his childhood. It may have been the city where his mother
was raised. Most likely he became the king of Uruk by marrying the
daughter of the reigning monarch and thus gained the kingship by
marriage rather than by conquest. Thereafter, 'King of Uruk'
became his chosen title rather than “Ensi of Umma”.
After settling matters in Sumer, Lugalzagesi turned his attention to
foreign lands. He went on to conquer Akkad, Sumer’s neighbor to the
northwest. In so doing, he became the “King of Kish”, the traditional title
for any king who ruled all of Sumer and Akkad, although he is not
Lugalzagesi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/80701.html
5 of 9 8/18/2020, 3:34 PM



named as such in any surviving documents. He also conquered Elam,
Sumer’s neighbor to the northeast. He later conquered parts of Syria.
Lugalzagesi could therefore claim he ruled the world from the Upper Sea
(the Mediterranean) to the Lower Sea (the Persian Gulf). It’s been
suggested he didn’t actually rule these territories, but only successfully
raided them. Maybe this is true; perhaps he was only just beginning to
build an empire before his death. Things might have been different had he
lived longer.
Lugalzagesi gives a pleasing portrait of life during his reign. “In those
days, Uruk in rejoicing spent its days under him. Ur, like a bull, its head
skyward did lift up under him.” He goes on
to list other cities, but fails to mention Lagash. Presumably, Lagash had
little to celebrate
during his reign. Otherwise, “All the lands in river meadows rested
(contentedly) under him,
and the nation was happily making merry under him.” (Lugalzagesi
Translation). By this time
he was getting on in years. Assuming he came to power when he was 25
(just a guess)
he was now 50 - 59 years old, depending on how long he reigned, which is
quite elderly
by the standards of the ancient world. He could rest content; things were
going well, until...

There was an insurrection in Akkad. A man named Sargon, a mere Cup
Bearer, had overthrown his king, Ur-Zababa, in the city of Kish. Ur
Zababa had been a vassal king of Lugalzagesi. Sargon went on to unify (or
conquer) the Akkadians, and was now leading an army toward Sumer. To
meet the threat, Lugalzagesi gathered together his own army, the
“army of fifty ensis”. This was either an unprecedented show of unity
among the Sumerians or it demonstrated Lugalzagesi’s total control of the
Sumerian city-states.
There were two pitched battles. The Sumerians were defeated both times.
It's been
speculated that some of the ensis were less than enthusiastic in their
defense of the realm,
or they abandoned the battlefield, or they even switched sides, believing
that Lugalzagesi
was a greater threat to their independence than Sargon. If they truly
believed this, they
could not have been more sorely mistaken. They were soon to be bitterly
disillusioned.
The following section is from “Warfare in the Ancient Near East to 1600
BC: Holy Warriors at the Dawn of History”, by William James Hamblin. It
begins with a Babylonian inscription:
“Sargon, king of Akkad, steward of the goddess Ishtar, king of the world,
anointed priest of the god Anum, lord of the land, governor on earth for
the god Enlil, was victorious over Uruk in battle, conquered fifty governors
with the mace of the god Ilaba, as well as the city of Uruk and destroyed
[Uruk’s] walls. Further, he captured Lugalzagesi, the king of Uruk, in
battle and led him off to the gate of the god Enlil in a neck stock.”
Following his victory over Uruk, Sargon faced a new challenge. The
Sumerian vassal rulers had asserted their independence after the fall of
their overlord Lugalzagesi to Sargon, requiring him to undertake at least
four additional campaigns in Sumer to secure Lugalzagesi’s entire
former domain.

“Sargon, king of Akkad, was victorious over Ur in battle, conquered the
city and destroyed its walls. He conquered Eninmar, destroyed its walls,
and conquered its districts and Lagash as far as the sea [Persian Gulf]. He
washed his weapons in the sea. He was victorious over Umma in battle,
conquered the city, and destroyed its walls.”
The important after-battle ritual washing of weapons was designed to
cleanse them of blood and purify them. When inscriptions describe
Sargon’s weapons being washed “in the Upper and Lower Seas” (the
Mediterranean and Persian Gulf), it is meant to indicate that Sargon had
reached the end of the known world, and could therefore ritually cleanse
his weapons, since there was nothing left to conquer. [It is probably also a
direct allusion to Lugalzagesi’s claim of having conquered the entire world
from the Upper to the Lower Seas. jjs]
The destruction of the walls of a conquered city, while not unknown
before, became
standard policy under Sargon. Presumably the city walls were not entirely
destroyed,
but were left with major breaches or without gates, rendering them
indefensible and thereby making rebellion a very dubious proposition. The
fact that so many cities in the Akkadian empire repeatedly rebelled despite
their ruined city walls is an indicator of the great hatred
the conquered people had for their Akkadian overlords.
[The Akkadian Empire was truly despised. When it finally fell, its capital
city of Agade was
so thoroughly destroyed that no one today even knows where it is. jjs]
The aged Lugalzagesi was dragged to Nippur in a neck stock and marched
through the city in Sargon’s victory procession. As a final humiliation,
Sargon made him watch the construction of a victory stele
commemorating his defeat. It must have been agonizing for Lugalzagesi,
watching the stele take shape, knowing that when it was finished he would
be executed.
It is easy to imagine how the final scene unfolded:
Lugalzagesi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/80701.html

When the stele was at last completed, Lugalzagesi was hauled from his
prison cell and paraded through the city streets, to the howls and derision
of the people. Perhaps now, after months of humiliation and
mistreatment, he welcomed the end. He was taken to the
temple of the war god as the place for his execution, which was the custom
of Akkadian kings. In front of the temple stood the newly erected victory
stele, surrounded by priests and dignitaries. After a boastful speech by
Sargon, Lugalzagesi was dragged to the base of the stele and forced to the
ground. Then with proper pomp and religious ceremony, Lugalzagesi was
put to death. It was an inglorious end to a great Sumerian king.
It would be more than two hundred years later, at the time of Ur-Namma,
before Sumer would once again be ruled by a Sumerian king.
