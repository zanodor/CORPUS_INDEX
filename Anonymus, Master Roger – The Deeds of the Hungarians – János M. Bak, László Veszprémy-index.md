GENERAl EDiTORS’ pREfACE
in general, the Central European Medieval Texts (CEMT) series—which attempts to present in good editions original latin narratives of the region together with up-to-date, annotated English translations—may no longer need special justification, now that this fifth volume has reached the “half-way mark” of the planned ten. However, the organization of the present one may.
in this volume we print the text and translation of two narratives, the subjects of which lie some three hundred years (and more) apart. The Gesta Hungarorum of the anonymous notary is a literary composition about the mythical origins of the Hungarians and their conquest of the Carpathian Basin. His narrative ends with the first grand princes of the tenth century. The Epistola in miserabile carmen super destructione regni Hungarie of Master Roger is an epistle which includes an eyewitness account of the Mongol invasion in 1241–2, beginning with an analysis of the political conditions under King Béla iV and ending with the king’s return to the devastated country. However, the two authors are by no means so far from each other as the setting of their narratives might suggest. Roger may have been born just about the time when the notary wrote his Gesta, and would thus have been merely one generation younger. Moreover, one may argue that the Mongol destruction of great parts of the country gave King Béla a chance for a “new foundation” of the kingdom that had been established at the time when the story of the Gesta ends. Thus, our decision to present these two short narratives together is not as inapposite as it may look at first sight. we hope our readers will not find it inappropriate either.

Viii GENERAl EDiTORS’ pREfACE
CEMT was born out of renewed interest in Central (or East Central) Europe on the one hand and the difficulty to access the medieval narratives of the region, especially for those less fluent in latin than older generations were, on the other. So far, we have been able to present texts from Bohemia, Croatia (Dalmatia), Hungary and poland, and we hope to continue on this road. Our principles remain the same: we print the best available critical edition of the original version, usually without full philological apparatus but with extensive annotations to the translation for readers less familiar with the history and geography of the region. financial restraints, well known to our readers everywhere in the academic world, have hindered us from keeping to our original plan of publishing a volume a year, but we still hope to complete at least the first round of major narrative sources within the next five to six years.
we are still open to suggestions for texts to be considered and eager to hear from volunteers who would care to join our team of editors and translators. we hardly need to add that we welcome financial support of any kind from granting agencies so as not to have to rely exclusively on the goodwill and enthusiasm of our colleagues in preparing the editions and translations.
The General Editors are grateful to the editors of The Slavonic and East European Review (UCl, SEES) for allowing us to utilize for this volume the earlier English version of the Gesta, translated by Martyn Rady (published in their journal in 2009). The Central European University press gave, in spite of its tight budget, the usual careful attention to the publication of this book; we are indebted to its management and production team.

iNTRODUCTiON
The Gesta Hungarorum of the anonymous notary of King Béla is the oldest extant chronicle of the history of the Hungarians.1 in his seminal study of the narrative sources of medieval Hungary, C. A. Macartney described it as “the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts.”2 purporting to be an account of the background, circumstances and immediate aftermath of the Hungarian settlement in the Carpathian Basin in the late ninth century, the chronicle was probably composed in the early years of the thirteenth century and reflects the literary tastes and political concerns of its own age.
MANUSCRipT AND EDiTiONS
The Gesta survives in a sole MS of 24 folios (48 pages of which two are blank), 17 by 24 cm in size, written in a Gothic minuscule that on the basis of its hand and decoration may be dated to the midthirteenth century. The writing and the elaborate initial p of the incipit (see fig. 1, p. XVi), are characteristic of that time. it is clearly not an autograph. There are many scribal errors, especially in the manner of abbreviation and in respect of proper names. So, for ex
1 it is, however, more than likely that the early parts of the so-called “Hungarian Chronicle”, known only from later copies, were written earlier, but whether the author of the Gesta knew them cannot be established with any certainty. The scholarship on this issue up to his own times is summarized in C. A. Macartney, Studies in the Earliest Hungarian Historical Sources, 7 vols in 8 parts (Budapest and Oxford, 1938–51); republished in C. A. Macartney, Studies on Early Hungarian and Pontic History, ed. lóránt Czigány and lászló péter (Aldershot and Brookfield, VT: Ashgate, 1999), pp. 65–560.

ample, the word civitatem (‘city’), abbreviated as civitēm, was rendered in the extant manuscript as civitem, which makes no sense. Most tellingly, in ch. 45, where the author wrote about Neopatras (present-day Ypatri in Greece), which fits the story of a Hungarian raid into Byzantine territory, the copyist misread the capital N and made out of it a better known name: “Cleopatra.”3 it is not clear whether the extant text is complete, and not much should be made of the author’s failure to discuss a subject promised earlier in his text.4 The fate of the copy through the centuries is not known. Catalogue evidence suggests that it had reached the imperial library (Hofbibliothek) in Vienna some time between 1601 and 1636, when Sebastian Tengnagel, court librarian and later director, registered it as Historia Hungarica de VII primis ducibus Hungariae auctore Belae regis notario, pasted this into the MS, and added numbers both to the chapters and to the folios. The Gesta was later mentioned in the catalogue of the court librarian Mattheus Mauchter in 1652 as De gestis Hungarorum liber, and by peter lambeck in 1666. Their successor, Daniel Nessel suggested in 1692 that it should be edited. in 1711, David Czvittinger wrote a detailed report of the Gesta in his encyclopaedic Specimen Hungariae Literatae. Some time before 1780, Adam Kollár, director of the Hofbibliothek, had a manuscript from the collection of Schloss Ambras near innsbruck bound with it, but they were later (in the first part of the nineteenth century) separated. it was then that the Gesta received its present leather binding, impressed with a gilt two-headed imperial eagle.5 The manuscript came to Hunga

4 The MS ends with a rhyming couplet which suggests that at least a break was intended there, but a discussion of events promised in ch. 15 (p. 45) is not followed up in the surviving copy.
5 The history of the MS in the Vienna library was reconstructed in detail by Emil Jakubovich, “Az ambrasi gyűjteményből való-e Béla király névtelen jegyzőjének kódexe” [is the codex of the anonymous notary of King Béla from the Ambras collection?], Magyar Könyvszemle 34 (1927), pp. 84–99, with full bibliography.

ry in 1934 under the terms of the 1932 Treaty of Venice (in which the treasures of the Hapsburg Empire were distributed among the successor states) and is now held in the Széchényi National library as Clmae 403. The text was first published in 1746 by Johann Georg von Schwandtner in his Scriptores rerum Hungaricarum, with a preface by the learned polyhistor, Matthias Bél6; four reprints followed in the subsequent twenty years. János letenyei translated the Gesta into Hungarian in 1790 and gave the author the name “Anonymus,” which has remained ever since. Between then and the end of the nineteenth century, the MS was re-published more than a dozen times. A scholarly edition, with critical annotation, was first published by Gyula pauler and lászló fejérpataky in 1900, and a revised edition by Emil (Aemilius) Jakubovich and Dezső (Desiderius) pais in the first volume of imre (Emericus) Szentpétery’s Scriptores Rerum Hungaricarum. A full-tone facsimile edition was published more recently. The latin text has been translated several times into Hungarian, as well as into Romanian, German, Slovak, and polish. The present English-language version, based on one published in The Slavonic and East European Review,7 is the first parallel edition, with critical apparatus, of the latin text and an English translation.
AUTHOR AND DATE
Despite two hundred years of scholarly effort, the identity of the author has not been established. He describes himself in the first line of the text as “p who is called master, and former notary of the late King Béla of good memory,” but virtually every word in this sentence poses problems. The initial p, together with dictus, was read by some (thus by Schwandtner in the editio princeps) as

an abbreviation for praedictus, that is “aforementioned,” on the assumption, from the empty page preceding the text, that in the extant copy a “title page” had been erased which originally gave the full name of the author (even though this would be unusual for medieval MSS). This hypothesis was rejected even before it was established with modern technology that the empty page contains merely an erased faulty beginning of the Gesta and no indication of any name of an author. Then, the p was understood as the initial of the author (although no dot follows it, as might be expected were it the abbreviation of a name). Accordingly, scholars hunted for an author called peter, paul or such like, but although some were suggested, none could be unequivocally connected to the Gesta.
That the author called himself “dictus” magister has caused needless headache to scholars. The humility formula, implying something like “although unworthy” (and typical for ecclesiastics) was widely used; indeed, there is even a similar wording in a charter from 1226 by Abbot Uros of pannonhalma.8 Speculation about the author not having in fact obtained a degree and other similar constructions are irrelevant.9 Nor is the term notarius (which the author previously, perhaps in his younger years, had been) problematic. Although there were no notaries (public) in medieval Hungary, the staff of the gradually emerging chancellery, small in number, had ever since the late twelfth century been described as notaries. A further problem arises with the identity of King Béla, the deceased former sovereign of the author. There were four kings of Hungary called Béla. Béla i, one of the exiled sons of the blinded Vazul, a relative of St Stephen, reigned briefly between 1060 and
8 See lászló Erdélyi, ed., A pannonhalmi Szt. Benedek rend története, 12 vols. (Budapest: Stephaneum, 1902–1916), vol. 1, p. 680, and a similar wording from the year 1221, vol. 12, p. 201.
9 in fact, in the time of Anonymus the title magister did not imply a university degree or teaching license; see Rainer Maria Herkenrath, “Studien zum Magistertitel in der frühen Stauferzeit,” Mitteilungen des Instituts für österreichische Geschichtsforschung 88 (1988), p. 5 (pp. 3–35).

1063. Béla ii “the Blind,” blinded as a child together with his father, prince álmos, by King Coloman, reigned from 1131 to 1141. Béla iii, who returned from Byzantium where he had been for a while heir presumptive to Emperor Manuel, was king between 1172 and 1196. finally, there is Béla iV, Hungary’s ruler during the Mongol invasion and acclaimed “restorer” of the kingdom, who reigned longer than all his namesakes, from 1235 to 1270. The basic difficulty of identifying the author and dating his writing is compounded by the fact that very few charters were issued before the 1220s (and even less survived). Accordingly, the names and properties (estates, castles, etc.) mentioned in the Gesta cannot be cross-checked with the evidence preserved elsewhere in order to establish more exactly the time of the chronicle’s composition.10 from the eighteenth to the mid-twentieth century the central issue was the “reliability” of the author: that is, how well informed he was of the events he related, and, thus, how much reliance may be put on his pieces of “information.” in respect of his reliability, it was assumed that the earlier he could be shown to have composed his account, the better; for if he wrote in the eleventh century—or at least in the early twelfth—he might be supposed to have “known” more precisely what happened in the ninth. On the other hand, it had to be conceded that many expressions or references in the Gesta pointed to a later composition, maybe even as late as the end of the thirteenth century. The debate over the four Bélas could fill a library and elicited some very acute and valuable philological and historical insights, which it is hardly necessary to rehearse here. for some time now, the scholarly consensus—though not without some scholars holding out for a different dating—is that Anonymus was formerly employed by Béla iii and thus wrote his Gesta some time after 1192. Even accepting this date as a terminus post quem, the exact date of the Gesta’s composition is still debated. presently, most historians (disregarding the minority who still doubt the connection

to Béla iii) suggest a date later than the traditional “ca. 1200.” The concern to justify Hungarian claims to the territory of the kingdom vis-à-vis Byzantium or to explain the involvement of the royal house in the affairs of Halich, relevant in the years immediately following Béla’s death,11 speaks for an early thirteenth-century date. How much later it could have been written is an open question, depending on the weight given to linguistic and historical (charters &c.) evidence. However, considering the probable age of the author and the fact that it is unlikely that the Mongol invasion of 1241 would not have left traces in the Gesta, the terminus ante quem could be as late as the 1230s. while the name of the author remains an enigma (and in our times the need to find names for anonymous authors, a matter central to scholarly enquiry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,12 is of less importance), some features of his career can be culled from the text. it has been assumed—partly based on his formulaic reference to “schoolmate N.”—that he studied at a french or (more likely) italian university or cathedral school, but his rather simple latin and limited familiarity with the Classics speaks against that. it would have been, for example, obvious to borrow from Vergil when telling the story of the foundation of a new homeland, but he never did.13 His schooling was more probably that of a notary and his style is closer to the rather unsophisticated urban chronicles of his time than to that of university-trained authors. Anonymus’s literary models are taken more from “popular
11 Between 1205 and 1213, King Andrew ii led almost yearly campaigns to Halich, supporting different claimants to its throne; after 1205/6 he used the title rex Galicie et Lodomerie in his royal style; and in 1214 he made his son, prince Coloman, king of Halich; see George A. perfecky, “Hungary and the Hungarians in the GalicianVolynian Chronicle,” Hungarian Studies 8 (1987) 1-2, pp. 19–29, with extensive quotations from primary evidence.
12 Compare the eighteenth-century efforts by Russian scholars to identify the author of the anonymous primary Chronicle; see Oleksiy Tolochko, “On Nestor the Chronicler’,” Harvard Ukrainian Studies, forthcoming (2010).
13 Compare, among others, Cosmas of prague, whose chapter on the settlement of the ancestors in Bohemia is thoroughly indebted to the Aeneid, or Dudo of St. Quentin, who used Vergil for his story of the Normans’ foundation of their duchy.

readings” than from the Classics or ecclesiastical authors. The occasional word or term from such authorities must have reached him second hand. He may, however, had travelled abroad, as he was familiar with some areas of western Europe, and it is unlikely that the books he read (as discussed below) would have been available in Hungary The author’s knowledge of place names, major roads and castles, especially in the north-eastern part of Hungary, and the frequent echo of formulas of charters in the text confirm his closeness to the itinerant royal court.14 His linguistic abilities are unclear: he seems to have known some Magyar, but whether it was his first language is uncertain, since sometimes he uses Hungarian “case endings” in the latin, as if unaware of Hungarian grammar. (it has also been suggested that he took these forms from some long-lost, heroic songs and retained them unchanged.) Still, many of his etymologies are correct and betray a knowledge of the vernacular. He felt, for example, that an ending –d implied a Hungarian diminutive (e.g., Borsod, ch. 18, p. 49 and elsewhere).15 it has been demonstrated that he knew little if any Greek but may have had a grasp of some Turkic language (he was possibly the first European writer to call the Black Sea as such, which suggests some acquaintance with Turkic).16 His occasional etymologies based on
14 it is worth noting that from the forty-eight castles mentioned by Anonymus, forty-four have been identified by archaeologists as being built in the árpádian age (though, of course, not in the ninth century); see istván Bóna, Az Árpádok korai várai
[Early castles of the árpadians], 2nd ed. (Debrecen: Etnica, 1998).
15 it has been suggested that the words contra stare for ‘resist, stand up against’ hide a Hungarism as mirror translation of Magyar ellenállni ‘stand against,’ since the expression is very rarely found in Medieval latin; however, it may come from the Bible. possible Hungarisms are also suggested in János Harmatta, “Remarques sur le lexique du latin médiéval et la substrat hongrois,” Acta Antiqua Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 13 (1975), pp. 335–44.

Slavic words are correct. But these are only hypotheses. whether our notary obtained higher ecclesiastical preferment after service in the chancellery cannot be ascertained, although it is supposed by most scholars. That he did not identify himself as such may have been due to the stylistic demands of the humility topos.

More relevant than the exact identity of the author is his purpose in writing, the causa scribendi. Even if we disregard the witty construction of Szabolcs de Vajay, who played with the idea that the Gesta was but a “game” among intellectuals,18 there are many other possible guesses as to the author’s intentions. Anonymus may indeed have intended to give a historically-grounded account of early Hungarian history that was not based upon the songs of minstrels and the yarns of yokels,19 and that comported with the historical fashion of his times. To present a respectable or even illustrious origo gentis—in this case, the descent of the Hungarians from the undefeated Scythians—was a common endeavor in the Middle Ages.20 Similarly, to establish an elegant genealogy for the ruling dynasty—here by associating it with Japhet, son of Noah, and
the Morkinskinna (c. 1220), ed. finnur Jónsson, pp. 84–5 (Copenhagen: Jørgensen, 1932), thus, the form may have reached Anonymus from other directions as well.

18 The well-known medievalist Szabolcs de Vajay, wrote a tongue-in-cheek novel, published (appropriately anonymously!) with the title Én, Anonymus [i, Anonymus] (Budapest: Argumentum, 1998), in which he has the notary write a spoof Gesta for the amusement of a friend. 19 See below, prologue and ch. 42, pp. 5 and 91.

with the Old Testament Gog and Magog, and even more so, with Attila the Hun, the “scourge of God,”—fits well with the legendary stories of other ruling houses. The notary did even more, assigning to the landowning clans and kindreds of his time heroic ancestors from the “conquest age,” who received their estates from none less than árpád, chief of the ninth-century Magyars, and “hold it ever since,” as the author repeatedly confirms. As a member of the chancellery, he may have had access to donation charters, even if there was hardly any central register of such grants in his time (nor was there any later). Throughout the Hungarian Middle Ages, the proems (narrationes) of these documents often referred in detail to past heroic deeds21 as the reason for the grant of an estate in perpetuum. The exploits of the heroes and the suitable prizes obtained for them, as told by the notary, reflect this perception of service and reward. indeed, it was not long after 1200 that the leading families began to refer to a real or legendary ancestor of their kindred when describing themselves as being de genere &c (‘of the kindred of...’).22 By lauding the descent of the royal house and of the kingdom’s leading families, the Gesta may thus have been welcome both to the court and to the king’s great men, the author’s lords and contemporaries. Moreover, Anonymus did not tire to underline that árpád consulted his retinue every time before deciding on a campaign or embassy, while in the so-called “blood contract” the legendary chieftains (the “principal persons” in his usage) were guaranteed that they and their offspring would forever hold the possessions they had obtained and would not be left out of the prince’s council.23 The oath additionally contains in rudimentary form what became the oft-discussed “right of resistance” of the no

bility, codified in the famous Golden Bull of Andrew ii of 1222.24 All these notions coincided with the concerns of the ever more powerful aristocracy of the early thirteenth century, one of the possible intended “audiences” of the retired notary. in contrast to most historians of his age, Anonymus, even though most likely a clerk, did not denigrate the pagan ancestors of the Magyars but rather emphasized that God or the Holy Spirit had led them in their battles and exploits.25 Of course, the conviction that victory is granted by God to the just side, and thus that the victors must have had divine support, was general in the Christian Middle Ages,26 but the notary went further than this. He underlined more than once that the pagan Magyars were granted victory and obtained new land with the express support of God. Only once did he admit that the Hungarians of the tenth century were bent on conquest and the ruthless subjection of peoples—but then right away added that they were compelled so to act, otherwise they could not have bequeathed land and power to succeeding generations.27 The Christianization of the people by St Stephen is noted briefly and one who resisted it, condemned,28 but in the Gesta none of the usual “discontinuity” can be detected between the distant heathen past and the Christian age. Thus a divine legitimization of all past deeds of the “ancestors” was interwoven with the “national history.” Subsequently, the “mission” of the Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin became a basic tenet of Magyar national identity, with or without a religious or metaphysical content.

METHOD AND SOURCES
Anonymus’s account is above all else a “toponymic romance” that seeks to explain place-names by reference to imagined events or persons, and vice versa. Not having had any reliable information on the early history of the Magyars, nor of the events surrounding their arrival and settlement in the Carpathian Basin, Anonymus had to invent the past on the basis of what he knew of his own time and assemble it in the narrative form popular in his age. The notary’s basic “method” was to explain the toponymy of the late twelfth century by reference to events and people living in the ninth and tenth centuries and to invent persons whose names he took from toponyms. He also sensed, correctly, that names of places, waters, and mountains or hills tend to preserve the memory of olden times or of their earliest inhabitants and first known owners. in fact, Hungarian place names are often derived from some ancient owner, without any morphological change. (Therefore, the many place names in the Gesta are valuable clues to the old Hungarian language, at least as it was spoken ca. 1200). it was by conflating persons with places that Anonymus arrived, for example, at the names of the warrior Csepel, of the Vlach lord, Marót, and of the defeated leader of Slavs, Salan. These personal names were all taken directly from contemporary toponymy, respectively the name of the island on the Danube immediately south of modern Budapest; that of two villages, both called Marótlaka (now: Morlaca), near Cluj29; and that of the ford of Szalánkemén/Slankamen on the confluence of the Danube and Tisza rivers. Although Anonymus got the names of the earliest Hungarian rulers right, as well as some of the early tribal chieftains, he described the Hungarians beating Slavic, Vlach and Bulgarian leaders whose names—as mentioned above—are not attested anywhere else. The Magyars allying themselves with the Cumans (who

appeared in Europe only in the late eleventh century) and, more incredibly, defeating “Romans” are particularly impressive items of his phantasy. All in all, his description of power-relations north of the Danube in the late ninth century is not supported by any other account. As he had no knowledge of the peoples encountered by the Magyars of the ninth century, he populated the region with those whom he knew from his own time or whose names appeared among the toponyms of his country. for good measure, he also added some, such as the Romans, derived from his own reading of popular histories. Nevertheless, there are bits of history also known from other sources in Anonymus’s work, and at least a few of his heroes can be confirmed from information given by Constantine porphyrogenitus, liudprand of Cremona, the Annals of St Gall, and the continuator of Regino of prüm.30 for much of the early history he borrowed extensively from Regino. As well, he plainly relied in part on diverse (unknown) written accounts, some of which would later feed into the “Hungarian Chronicle” known from a fourteenth-century compilation, but possibly going back to some centuries before.31 (The Hungarian Chronicle also tells of the shaven Cuman heads being sliced like unripe gourds.32) The extent

to which the author relied upon “oral traditions”—which he dismissed twice, but quoted once!—cannot, however, be tested, but it is not unlikely that the major clans had traditions of their own origins as well as minstrels who recited heroic songs about these. There are many stylistic elements in the Gesta, such as “formulaic” repetitions, that are typical of lays of this type. Alas, little can be said about these possible oral traditions, as the first surviving fragment of a vernacular “heroic song” is from the siege of Šabac, anno 1478—clearly far too distant from our notary’s time to tell us anything about what he might have heard. Based on his toponymic constructions and on some oral or written traditions, Anonymus decided to write a story of the Hungarians wandering westwards and occupying step by step, partly with victorious battles, the Carpathian Basin using the narrative modes he had learned from the stories of the siege of Troy and the exploits of Alexander the Great. According to the expectations of his age, when chroniclers were no more satisfied by merely reporting what they read or heard but wished to authenticate their narrative,33 Anonymus right away mentioned Scripture and Dares phrygius as his authorities. indeed, he relied on both. His Biblical references, mainly from the pentateuch but also from other books of the Old Testament, are not surprising in a clerical author. Dares and his Excidium Troie34 came to be Anonymus’s model not only by direct borrowings, but in the

overall structure of short but informative accounts naming important protagonists and main events.35 for the lively battle scenes, Anonymus’s guide was one of the popular romances about Alexander the Great.36 legal expressions abound in the Gesta. Some of them have a good pedigree, such as the word embola for ‘a troop’ that comes from Justinian’s Codex (1.2.10 etc.) and appears in twelfth-century commentaries as well. But it is unlikely that Anonymus read any of these. we may rather assume that he found the word in some model charter or formulary. His pun on exercitatior – exercitatione (ch. 55, p. 118–9) is also hardly his invention, since it appears in isidore of Seville’s Etymologies (9.3.58), but was no doubt similarly transmitted to him in some handbook or charter. Most of the legal terms are, however, borrowings from chancellery practice, identifiable from the—however few—Hungarian deeds of his age or earlier. Among the artes dictandi, Anonymus used, beyond doubt, that of Hugh of Bologna, the Rationes dictandi prosaice (ca. 111930),37 already in the first few lines of his work. (indeed, this is a strong argument against placing him in the eleventh century.) However, he did not follow it in the rest of his writing as his formulations are quite pedestrian. Excepting a few puns and not very imaginative metaphors, his style is plain, though mostly clear

and informative. The few rhymed sentences would not qualify as prosologium (verse inserts into prose) and one cannot find any of the more demanding rhetorical devices usual in twelfth- and thirteenth-century writings. After all this, it hardly needs to be emphasized that the Gesta is in no ways a source of information for the events it pretends to narrate, but rather for the ideas about them current in the Hungary of the notary’s times and for the literary skills of its author.
RECEpTiON
There are very few documents from the Middle Ages that carry such heavy political baggage. Soon after its publication in the eighteenth century, German scholars of the Universities of Halle and Göttingen dismissed it as a baseless tale, and called the author a “Fabelmann” (fairy-tale teller), particularly on account of his faulty description of the Rus’ principalities. in fact, these chapters of the Gesta offered a striking parallel to the description in the Russian primary Chronicle (first published in 1767) of the Hungarians’ passage by Kiev on their way to their new homeland. But August ludwig Schlözer and Johann Salomo Semler argued that the principalities mentioned by Anonymus did not exist in the ninth century. They also pointed to Anonymus’s uncritical and inconsistent use of Regino.38 Other German readers also noted the absence of any reference to Germans in the kingdom of Hungary, which is, in fact, a strange omission. while the Gesta’s authenticity in the strict sense of being a narrative composed in the Middle Ages, rather than a later forgery, was rarely doubted, it was nevertheless decried as not being a “true record.”

within the kingdom, it was a Slovak priest, Georgius Szklenár, who in 1784 and 1788 first registered doubts as to the Gesta’s reliability. His study was a seriously critical assessment, based on good philology, but he, too, dismissed the notary as “a liar” on account of his failure to include the location of Great Moravia.39 On the other hand, Anonymus’s account was given full credit when it served nationalist interests. The Romanians of the eighteenthcentury principality of Transylvania (at that time under Viennese rule) turned to him for support. in the Supplex libellus Valachorum, submitted to the Vienna court, the authors claimed the right to be one of the historic “nations” of Transylvania beside the Hungarians, Székely and Saxons. They argued on the basis of Anonymus’s narrative that, even though prince Gelou/Gyalu of the “Vlachs” was defeated by the Magyars, his subjects swore an oath of allegiance to the chief Tuhutum/Tétény. Hence their descendants should be accepted as a constituent community of the principality.40 All such challenges were rejected by patriotic Hungarian (and Saxon) authors, some of whom added serious scholarship to the study of the text. The first major monograph in defense of Anonymus, Daniel Cornides’s Vindiciae anonymi Bele Regis notarii, published posthumously in 1802, addressed virtually all the issues of dating and authenticity that were to be discussed in the subsequent two centuries. while he did not come down unequivocally on the date (hesitating between Bela ii and and iii), he mustered almost all problematic points which have featured in one way or another in the debates down to our day.41

The description which the author gives of the presence and whereabouts of peoples in Central Europe during the ninth century was extensively used to buttress historical claims to territories until well into the twentieth century. Readings of the Gesta were thus used after 1918 to justify the cession of Transylvania to Romania as well as, after the Second world war, of Oroszvár to Czechoslovakia.42 in 1987, the Gesta acquired particular notoriety on account of a full-page advertisement in The Times, paid for by the Romanian government, affirming the validity of the chronicler’s account of a Romanian presence in the Carpathian basin more than a thousand years before.43 Modern scholarly readings of the Gesta Hungarorum are less beset by political partisanship in the post-Schengen world of the EU. Only dinosaurs care about who was where first. On the other side, the story as presented by Anonymus quickly came to form the grande narrative of the Magyars in the age of budding national self-consciousness and beyond. The first major step was its transformation into an epic poem of ten cantos by the young Mihály Vörösmarty (1800–1855), published in 1825 as “The flight of zalán: A Heroic poem.”44 in the best Homeric tradition—following the example of the seventeenthcentury Hungarian epic by Nicholas zrínyi/zrinski on the siege of the castle of Szigetvár45—Vörösmarty described in romantic fashion heroic musters, roaring battle scenes, and the tragic fates of the vanquished.

partly of his own invention,46 and the entire image of the victorious horsemen defeating the cowardly Slavs became the common inheritance of the Hungarian public, “folklorized” through calendars and schoolbooks until well into the twentieth century.47 for the millennial celebration of the “arrival of the Hungarians” in 1896, the novelist Maurus Jókai (1825-1904) designed a 120-metre panorama, which in its depiction of events closely followed Anonymus’s account.48 in 1995, the restored panorama, after suffering damage in the Second world war, was put on public view at pusztaszer, where, according to Anonymus’s account, the conquering Hungarians had first drawn up their laws.

The titles of the chapters follow the rubrics of the surviving manuscript, and the numbering of the chapters adheres to conventions set since the eighteenth century. As usual in modern editions, the author’s usage regarding u/v has been normalized, but occasionally (in proper names) retained for the sake of authenticity. The translation follows the principles of the CEMT series. it attempts to reproduce as far as possible the sense and style of the latin original while offering a readable English narrative. in the case of the Gesta we may have been more rigorous than usual in following the latin, retaining repetitions and circumlocutory formulations even if the sentence structure thus became awkward. A few exceptions to CEMT practice have been made. Besides “modernizing” all proper names, about which more below, we reduced the number of ets and cut up the notary’s often interminably long sentences, frequently containing events or comments not belonging in the same statement. The usual latin form of beginning titles, De (On...), was omitted for easier readability. we tried to rescue as much as possible of the author’s word-plays, but did not succeed in all cases. The two or three rhyming inserts are translated in such a way as to give an impression of their character. Verbatim quotations taken from diverse sources (reproduced in italics) are identified wherever appropriate,50 but the author’s frequent recurrence to his readings (such as the story of Troy or the Alexander the Great romances) was not specified in every case.

lowed CEMT practice by referring mainly to titles in languages other than Hungarian (or other local vernaculars), assuming that readers familiar with these will be able to find the references in the national bibliographies and handbooks. Considering the extensive scholarship on innumerable details of the Gesta, we had to be economical. The bibliography (pp. 229–41 below) may help to identify additional literature. The usual problem of translating technical terms in medieval Central European texts into English—due to the different social and political development from that in the British islesemerged with the Gesta as well, and even more so as the notary applied terms of his own time to describe events occurring many hundred years before. Among these are such words as dux, nobilis and jobagio. The first is the most problematic. Anonymus seems to have used the term in its very basic meaning, as ‘leader.’ He did not mean by “duke” the ruler or commander of a region or group of people subordinate to a sovereign. His duces, be they leaders of the Hungarians or their opponents, were supreme lords of their respective “polities.” Therefore, we decided to follow the traditional Hungarian custom of calling the heads of peoples or major territorial units “princes” (with the exception of the dukes of the Czechs, who bore this title in the earlier Middle Ages). we did not attempt to be precise in a “constitutional” sense, thus our choice is open to challenge. The author’s reference to nobiles and jobagiones can be decoded on the basis of near-contemporary records (such as the Golden Bull of Andrew ii of 1222). There, both terms refer to the major lords or aristocrats, even though the two words changed their meaning in the course of the thirteenth century. Nobiles came to mean a wide stratum of freemen with landed property, and jobagio (from the Hungarian ‘jobbágy’) a seigneurially dependent peasant. The notary used the two terms in their ancient meaning, thereby adding to the debate over the dating of his text. Another term with specific meaning for the medieval Hungarian society is genus, used by Anonymus for the descendants of the legendary heroes of his story. we translate it as ‘kindred,’ a term introduced in the translation of Erik fügedi’s pioneering study of a noble family

network in northern Hungary.52 The kindreds—similar to clans, but differing in the way they reckoned their membership and in some other characteristics—seem to have held land in common. Even after the land had been divided up between branches (and later families), all male members of the kindred had inheritance rights in case of default of issue and thus retained a concurrent legal interest. Many kindreds had a central castle and a sacral centre (‘kindred monastery’) that served as their common funeral site. As argued above, the Gesta seems to have been written to a great extent for the purpose of giving these twelfth- and thirteenth-century kindreds an archaic pedigree. Much less problematic is that the author calls all waters, from creek to river (even lake!) fluvius (exceptionally: rivulus, stagnum), and all elevations, be they only 20–50 meters high, mons; we keep his usage and translate all of these as ‘river’ and ‘mountain’ (unless otherwise specified by the author). Similarly, Anonymus called every settlement of some importance castrum or Hungarian -vár (castle), regardless whether in fact it was ever a fortified site. we have occasionally commented on this, but otherwise translated his appellation verbatim. Additional problems of translation are discussed in the relevant notes. Names posed here a greater problem than in several other texts in this series. As mentioned above, only very few personal names are known from other sources; most of them were invented by the author based on place names or borrowed from his own time. Both those in charters and the Gesta are inconsistent in their spelling. in the course of the two hundred years of scholarly study of this text, a certain convention (not without doubts and disagreements among experts) has emerged in Hungarian historiography, and we have followed it. Some of the spellings (mostly based on linguistic study) have been revised in the last decades, and we have taken those suggestions into consideration. Readers having

The problem of continuity between the ancient clans of the “Conquest Age” and the kindreds known from the twelfththirteenth century (and beyond) is a moot point and needs not to detain us here.



XXXViii iNTRODUCTiON
the parallel latin text on the left hand page may decide to accept or reject our constructions. (The variants can be easily compared in the index of Names, pp. 243–50 below). None the less, it has to be admitted that no one is sure about the “original” form of most of the names, if they ever existed outside the imagination of Anonymus. As to geographical names—as discussed above, a significant element in the whole work—we have chosen to be pragmatic. without going into the controversies over the one or the other toponym, we accepted the most convincing reconstruction and have sought to identify it with a name appearing on a modern map. Quite a few of these are, admittedly, uncertain, but Hungarian historians and archaeologists have applied so much attention to this text that we had plenty of suggestions to choose from. CEMT policy is to print geographical names in their present-day officialor usual Anglicized—form. This may sound anachronistic, but considering that in our own time the Carpathian Basin is divided between several states each with its official language, only this procedure allows readers to find the location on any good map. (The different versions of the place names are listed in the Gazetteer, pp. 263–8; and a map on the front endpaper, using Anonymus’s spelling, gives some indication of the approximate location of most of them.)

I did indeed promise that i would do so, but hindered by other matters, i might have almost entirely forgotten your request and my promise, had not your

6 literally, ‘the seven Hungarians.’ Constantine porphyrogenitus (DAi, ch. 38, pp. 170–1) confirms that the tribes of the Hungarians were seven in number. Throughout the text, the seven leaders are referred to as principales persone (which may be a borrowing from canon law, see, e.g., Corpus Iuris Canonici, vol. 2 Greg iX, lib. 2, Tit. 1, c. xiv [col. 245], or Tit. Vii. C.i [col. 265], &c.). incidentally, the ‘Seven Hungarians’ may have been the name of the tribal alliance; such appellations were common among steppe people, for example the name Onogur—a ‘people’ to which the Magyars belonged in the seventh-ninth centuries—means ‘the ten Ogurs’. 7 On the problem of translating dux, see above, p.

Mindful therefore of your kindness, and although hindered by the many and various affairs of this wearisome world, i have undertaken to do your bidding, following the example of diverse historians, supported by the help of God’s grace; seeing this as best lest it be lost to posterity forever, I considered it best that i should write to you truthfully and plainly, so that readers can know exactly what happened.1 it would be most unworthy and completely unfitting2 for the so most noble people of Hungary to hear as if in sleep of the beginnings of their kind and of their bravery and deeds from the false stories of peasants and the gabbling song of minstrels.3 May they not more nobly perceive the truth of matters from the sure explanation of Scripture and the straightforward exposition of historical accounts? Glad thus is Hungary made, by the gifts to her conveyed, and should rejoice all hours in the gift of her men of letters,4 because she has now [a record of ] the beginning of her line of kings and noblemen, for which kings shall be praise and honor to the King Eternal and the holy Mary, His mother, through whose grace the kings of Hungary and noblemen have the kingdom for happy purpose here and ever after.

5 The account of Scythia given here ultimately derives from Justin’s Epitoma historiarum Philippicarum, 2.1— M. Ivniani Ivstini Epitoma Historiarvm Philippicarvm Pompei Trogi, ed. Otto Seel (leipzig: Teubner, 1972), pp. 18–9—and the Exordia Scythica—MGH AA, vol. 11/2, ed. Theodor Mommsen, pp. 308–22 (Berlin: weidmann, 1984)—mediated through Regino, ad a. 889 (pp. 131–2).
6 The origin of this word—for both the legendary ancestral land and its inhabitants—is unclear. its first part may refer to the River Don and the second to the name of the Magyars. Simon of Kéza and the Hungarian Chronicle have Dentia and Mogoria as two of the three parts of Scythia. 7 On the term ‘Black Sea,’ see above, p. XXiii.

1 it is interesting that the author called this animal and its fur (also below, pp. 29 and 41) zobolini, apparently from the Russian sobol, while elsewhere in medieval latin it is called sabellum. 2 Rev. 20.7; isidore of Seville (Etym. 14.4.150 and 9.3.402).

4 Justin had discussed the Egyptians before writing about the Scythians (2.1, p. 18); hence the adjective “more” ancient. 5 Potestas is a textual corruption; the Exordia (p. 319) has posita (‘located’).
6 Magog is mentioned as filius Japhet in Gen. 10.2. Japhet is either the eldest or youngest son of Noah (the Book of Genesis gives both) and father of Magog. According to isidore of Seville (Etym. 9.2.26-37), all the peoples of Europe were Japhet’s descendants, with Magog being the specific progenitor of the Scythians and Goths.

Gold and silver abound there and in the rivers of this land precious stones and gems are found. On its eastern side, neighboring Scythia, were the peoples Gog and Magog,2 whom Alexander the Great had walled in.3 Scythia is very extensive in its length and breadth and the men who dwell there, commonly called Dentumoger, have right up to the present day never been subject to the sway of any emperor. The Scythians are a more ancient people4 and the power5 of Scythia is in the east, as we said above. The first king of Scythia was Magog, son of Japhet,6 and this people were called after him Magyar,7 from whose royal line the most renowned and mighty King Attila8 descended, who, in the year of Our lord’s incarnation 451,9 coming down from Scythia, entered pannonia10 with a mighty force and, putting the Romans to flight, took the realm and made a royal residence for himself beside the Danube above the hot springs,11 and he ordered all the old buildings
7 Anonymus is alone in deriving the Hungarians’ name from Magog. Other chronicles construed an ancestor called Magor/Mogor (Simon of Kéza, pp. 15, 25; SRH vol. 1, p. 249, &c.).
8 from the extensive literature on the Attila tradition see, e.g., Martyn Rady, “Recollecting Attila: Some medieval Hungarian images and their antecedents,” Central Europe 1 (2003), pp. 5-17. it is to be noted that despite including Attila in the genealogy of the dynasty, Anonymus—unlike the other chroniclers—did not connect the Huns to the Hungarians.

10 The author used (like many other medieval writers) the name of the Roman province, pannonia, for Hungary. However, the notary knew the precise meaning of the term, i.e. Hungary south and west of the Danube, and so applied the term more specifically to that region (see below, ch. 47, p. 103).
11 Anonymus here (as elsewhere with Hungarian names) translated the name Budafelhéviz, a village in the north of present-day Buda(pest), still a centre of hot springs and baths.

1 The ruins of Aquincum, the capital of pannonia inferior, may have been visible in the author’s time and the amphitheatre, the foundations of which still survive, must have made quite an impression on medieval spectators.
2 Budavár, i.e. “Buda castle,” is a problematic form, as the castle on Buda hill was not built before the Mongol invasion in 1241. The -burg ending in the German name may have induced the author to describe as a “castle” the royal residence in the area of Roman Aquincum, at the time called Buda, and later Óbuda, Buda Vetus, in distinction to the new castle.

A long time after, there descended from the progeny of the same King Magog, Ügek,4 father of prince álmos, from whom the princes and kings of Hungary trace their origin, as will be said in what follows. The Scythians, as we said, are a more ancient people, of whom historians writing of the deeds of the Romans said as follows: That the Scythian people were most wise and gentle; they did not work the soil nor barely knew any sin among them. And they did not have homes built by craft but rather tents made of felt.5 They ate meat and fish and milk and honey and they had much spice. And their clothes were of the pelts of sables and other wild beasts. They held gold, silver and gems as common as stones, which they found in the rivers of this land. They desired no one else’s goods, for they were all rich, having many animals and sufficient victuals. And there were no adulterers, for every man kept only his wife. But, later, this people, worn out in war, became, as some historians tell, so cruel that they ate in wrath human flesh and drank the blood of humans.6 And i believe that you may still know a hardy nation by its fruits.

The Kaiserchronik (ca. 1147), however, recorded that Attila was buried in Buda (Ofen); see MGH Dt Chr. i, 1, p. 237.
4 for the form (spelling etc.) of personal names, see above, p. XXXViii. The name Ügek may have some connection to the old Hungarian root igy~ügy meaning ‘holy, venerable.’
5 Anonymus added here to Regino’s description the specification “made of felt.” He may have been familiar with such tents in which the Hungarians of the twelfth century lived, at least during parts of the year; see The Deeds of Frederick Barbarossa by Otto of Freising and his Continuator Rahewin, trans. and ed. Charles Christopher Mierow (New York: Norton, 1953), p. 66.

The Scythian people were never subjugated by any emperor. for the Scythians made Darius, king of the persians, flee with the greatest ignominy, and Darius lost there 80,000 men and so fled in great fear to Persia. Then, the Scythians slew Cyrus, king of Persia, with 330,000 men. Then, the Scythians put to base flight even Alexander the Great himself, the son of King philip and Queen Olympias, who had conquered many kingdoms in war. The Scythian race was hardy so as to endure all toil and the Scythians were big in body and bold in war. And there is nothing in the world that they would not give up to revenge an injury done to them. And when the Scythians had a victory, they wished nothing of booty, as do their posterity today,1 but sought only praise for it. And except for Darius, Cyrus and Alexander, no people in the world dared enter their land. The aforesaid Scythian people were hardy in combat and, on speedy mounts and with helmeted heads, they were better with bows and arrows than all the other nations of the world, and you will know this to be so from their offspring. for the Scythian land, as much as it is distant from the tropics, is the more healthy for generating offspring. And although spacious enough, it was still insufficient to sustain or hold the host of peoples begotten there.2 On account of this, the seven leading persons, who are called the Hetumoger, not tolerating the pressures of space, thought very greatly of a solution. Then these seven leading persons, having taken counsel together, decided that they should forsake the soil of their birth and take for themselves such lands as they could inhabit, as will be said in what follows.
2 Overpopulation as reason for migration was a commonplace in medieval histories, see, e.g., paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardorum, i, 1, 52–3. paul gives the explanation of overpopulation for the movement of the Goths, Vandals and lombards, which Regino borrowed from paul to explain the migration of the Scythians, and Anonymus here follows Regino (ad a. 889). See Simon Maclean, History and Politics in Late Carolingian and Ottonian Europe: The Chronicle of Regino of Prüm and Adalbert of Magdeburg (Manchester and New York: Manchester University press, 2009), p. 204.

2 As usual, the author tries to explain a name from a toponym. Simon of Kéza (p. 79) changed the reference to the Ung River. in fact, the latin (and other western) name for the Magyars came from their having been part of the Onogur tribal alliance, but the notary could not have known that. On the names of the Magyars in the sources, see András Róna Tas, Hungarians and Europe in the Early Middle Ages: An Introduction to Early Hungarian History (Budapest and New York: Central European press, 1999), pp. 282–7, 340–1.

2 wHY THEY ARE CAllED HUNGARiANS
it now remains to say why the people who set forth from the Scythian land are called Hungarians. The Hungarians are so called from the castle of Hung1 where the seven leading persons, having subjugated the Slavs, tarried for a time upon entering the land of pannonia. On account of this, all the nations round about called álmos, son of Ügek, the prince of Hunguar and they called his warriors Hunguarians.2 what more? passing over these matters, we shall return to our task, keep to our story, and, as the Holy Spirit commands, finish the work begun.
3 álMOS, THE fiRST pRiNCE
in the year of Our lord’s incarnation 819, Ügek, who, as we said above, being of the kindred of King Magog became a long time later a most noble prince of Scythia, took to wife in Dentumoger the daughter of prince Eunedubelian,3 called Emese,4 from whom he begot a son, who was named álmos. But he is called álmos from a divine event, because when she was pregnant a divine vision appeared to his mother in a dream in the form of a falcon that seemed to come to her and impregnate her and made known to her that from her womb a torrent would come forth and from her
conflations are not rare, see, e.g., Geoffrey of Monmouth, Historia regum Britanniae, ed. R.E. Jones (london: longmans, 1929), pp. 249–51. Anonymus does not seem to have known of the tradition of a primeval raid on women by the legendary ancestors of the Magyars as told by Simon of Kéza (ibid.).
4 The name may go back to an old Hungarian word for ‘mother’ or ‘dam.’ She is not named in other narratives. Anonymus here may have recorded an early Hungarian myth of origo gentis—the union of a woman with the totem of a falcon—but he “cleansed” the story by making Emese already pregnant and adding the word quasi ‘as if ’ (“...seemed to...”). for a similar tradition among steppe people, see istván Vásáry, “History and legend in Berke Khan’s Conversion to the islam,” in Aspects of Altaic Civilization III. ed.

1 The author alludes here to the latin adjective, almus, which also conveyed the meaning of sanctus or pius. Neither of his etymologies are convincing. The holy kings are King Stephen i, his son Emeric (canonized in 1083), and St ladislas (canonized in 1192). 2 John 16. 21. 3 Here and many times further down: Acts 8. 9. 4 The description owes much to the wording of Dares phrygius (12, pp. 14–6).

loins glorious kings be generated, but that they would not multiply in their own land. Because a dream is called álom in the Hungarian language and his birth was predicted in a dream, so he was called álmos. Or he was called álmos, that is holy, because holy kings and dukes were born of his line.1 what more?
4 pRiNCE álMOS
prince álmos, after he was born into the world,2 brought great joy3 to prince Ügek and his kinsmen and to almost all the leading men of Scythia because his father Ügek was of the kindred of King Magog. for álmos himself was handsome of face, but of dark skin, and he had dark eyes, but big ones; tall and lean in stature, he had indeed large hands and long fingers4; and this álmos was kind, benevolent, generous, resourceful,5 a good warrior, and a cheerful giver6 to all those who were at that time warriors in the Scythian realm. when this álmos came to full age, as if the gift of the Holy Spirit was in him, although he was a pagan,7 he became yet more powerful and wiser than all the princes of Scythia and they conducted all the business of the realm at that time with his aid and counsel.8 prince álmos, when he came to full age of youth, took a wife in that land, the daughter of a certain most noble prince,9 from whom he begot a son by the name of árpád, whom he took with him into pannonia, as will be said in the following.

5 THE ElECTiON Of pRiNCE álMOS
The Hungarian people, most valiant and most powerful in the tasks of war thus originated, as we said above, from the Scythian people that are called in their own language Dentumoger. And their land was so full on account of the host of people born there that it was insufficient to sustain or keep them, as we said above. On account of this, the seven leading persons, who right up to the present day are called the Hetumoger, not tolerating the pressures of space, having taken counsel among themselves to quit the soil of their birth, did not cease seeking by arms and war to occupy lands that they might live in. Then they chose to seek for themselves the land of pannonia that they had heard from rumor had been the land of King Attila, from whose line prince álmos, father of árpád, descended.1 Then these seven leading persons realized from their common and true counsel that they could not complete the journey begun unless they had a leader and a master2 above them. Thus, by the free will and common consent of the seven leading persons, they chose as their leader and master, and of the sons of their sons to the last generation, álmos, son of Ügek, and those who descended from his kin, because prince álmos was the son of Ügek, and those who descended from his kin were more outstanding by birth and more powerful in battle. These seven leading persons were noble by birth, strong in war, and firm in their faithfulness. Then they said with equal will to prince álmos: “from today we choose you as leader and master and where your fortune takes you, there will we follow you.” Then on behalf of prince álmos the aforesaid men swore an oath, confirmed in pagan manner with their own blood spilled in a single vessel.3 And, although pagans, they nevertheless kept true to the oath that they now made among themselves, until they died.
clear whence Anonymus may have heard or read about it. A similar blood-mingling ceremony is reported in 1250 as having taken place between a Cuman king and Emperor Baldwin ii; see Joinville and Villehardouin, Chronicles of the Crusades, ed. M. R. B. Shaw (Harmondsworth: penguin, 1963), pp. 289–90. See also Maurice Keen, “Brotherhood in Arms,” History 47 (1962), pp. 1–17.

6 THEiR OATH
The first part of the oath was thus: That, as long as life remained, they and their descendants would always have a prince from the line of prince álmos. The second part of the oath was thus: That whatever goods they might acquire by their own efforts, none of them should be denied a share of them. The third part of the oath was thus: That those leading persons who by their free will had chosen álmos as their lord, they and their sons, should never at all be excluded from the counsel of the prince and the honor of the realm. The fourth part of the oath was thus: That if any of their posterity should be unfaithful to the person of the prince and stir up discord between the prince and his kinsmen, then the blood of the guilty one should be shed, just as their own blood had been shed in the oath that they had made to prince álmos. The fifth part of the oath was thus: That if any of the posterity of prince álmos and of the other leading men should seek to breach parts of their oath, they should be put under an everlasting curse.1 The names of the seven men were these: álmos, father of árpád; Előd, father of Szabolcs, from whom the Csák kindred descends2; Künd, father of Kurszán; Ónd, father of Ete, from whom the Kalán and Kölcse kindreds descend; Tas, father of lél; Huba, from whom the Szemere kindred descends3; and the seventh was Tétény,4 father of Horka, whose sons were Gyula and zombor, from whom the Maglód kindred descend, as will be said below.5 what more? let us keep to our story.
4 in recent Hungarian scholarship, Tuhutum has been seen, on the basis of several such place names, as a peculiar spelling of Tétény. The descendants listed here are a strange mixture. Horka and gyula are known to have been the titles of dignitaries (see DAi ch. 40, pp. 178-9). in ch. 24 ( below, p. 61) Gyula features as Tétény’s late descendant, while the Maglód kindred is not otherwise known.
5 The names of the seven chieftains differ from those given in other chronicles. in Simon of Kéza (pp. 81-5) and the Hungarian Chronicle (SRH 1, 286-93), three “captains” are mentioned with the same names as those whom Anonymus named as sons of the “principal persons,” four others have names partially known from later generations.

in the year of Our lord’s incarnation 884, as is contained in the annals of chronicles,1 the seven leading persons who are called the Hetumoger moved from the Scythian land towards the west. Among them, there marched prince álmos, son of Ügek, of the kindred of King Magog, a man of good repute, their lord and counselor, together with his wife and his son, árpád, and the two sons of his uncle Hülek, namely zovárd and Kadocsa, with a great and innumerable host of allied peoples from the same region. Advancing for very many days across empty places, they swam across the river Etil2 sitting on leather bags in pagan manner3 and they never came across a path leading to a city or house.4 Nor did they consume of the toils of men, as was their custom,5 but ate meat and fish until they reached Russia which is called Suzdal’.6 And their young men hunted almost every day, whence from that day until now the Hungarians are better at hunting than other peoples. And so prince álmos and all his own came and entered Russia which is called Suzdal’.

ing the river Dnieper, they sought to conquer the realm of the Rus’. Then the princes of the Rus’, learning of this, feared greatly because they had heard that prince álmos, son of Ügek, was of the line of King Attila, to whom their forefathers had annually paid tribute. Nevertheless, the prince of Kiev and all the leaders, having gathered and taken counsel among themselves, decided that they should do battle with prince álmos and that they preferred to die in war1 than to forfeit their realms and be subjected against their will to prince álmos. forthwith, the prince of Kiev, dispatching envoys, asked the seven dukes of the Cumans,2 his most faithful friends, for help. Then these seven dukes, whose names were these—Ed, Edemen, Etu, Böngér, Ocsád, father of Örsúr, Vajta, and Ketel, father of Alaptolma3—accompanied by no small host of horsemen, came most speedily against prince álmos for the sake of the prince of Kiev’s friendship. And the prince of Kiev with his army advanced against them and supported by the Cumans began to oppose prince álmos with an armed host. But prince álmos, whose help was the Holy Spirit, attired with arms, his battle-line ordered, went mounted on his horse, back and forth, encouraging his warriors and, as he stood with vigor before all his men he said to them: O Scythians,4 my fellow warriors and most brave men, be mindful of the start of your wanderings when you said that such land as you could inhabit you would take by arms and war. Do not therefore be troubled by the host of the Rus’ and the Cumans, who are as our dogs. For do not dogs, when they hear the words of their masters, start to tremble? Because strength does not rest in the numbers of a people but in resolution of

Did not the Scythians put to flight Darius, king of the Persians, and so in fear and the greatest disgrace he fled to Persia and lost there 80,000 men? And did not the Scythians destroy Cyrus, king of the Persians, with 330,000 men. And did not the Scythians put to base flight even Alexander the Great, son of King philip and Queen Olympias, who had conquered many kingdoms. So let us fight bravely and courageously those who are as our dogs and let us fear their host no more than a swarm of flies.” Hearing this, the warriors of prince álmos were much encouraged and they at once sounded on all sides the trumpets of war, and both lines of foes came together and they began to fight each other fiercely, and many of the Rus’ and the Cumans were slain. The aforesaid princes of the Rus’ and the Cumans, seeing that they were losing the battle, turned to flight and, hastening to save their lives, entered the city of Kiev. prince álmos and his warriors pursued the Rus’ and Cumans up to the city of Kiev and the warriors of prince álmos sliced the shaven heads3 of the Cumans as if unripe gourds.

daring of the Scythians, feared greatly. And when they realized that they could not resist them, the prince of Kiev and the other princes of the Rus’ and of the Cumans who were there, having dispatched envoys, asked prince álmos and his great men to make peace with them.1 when the envoys came to prince álmos and asked him that their lords be not expelled from their homes, prince álmos, having taken counsel with his men, answered the envoys of the Rus’ that the princes and their chief men should give their sons as hostages,2 and that they should pay every year a tribute of 10,000 marks3 and, in addition, food, clothes and other necessities. The princes of the Rus’, albeit unwillingly, nevertheless conceded all these things to prince álmos, but they told prince álmos that, after leaving the land of Halich,4 they should descend westward beyond the Havas wood5 into the land of pannonia, that had previously been the land of King Attila, and they recommended to them the land of pannonia as being good beyond measure. for they said that there flowed the most noble spring waters,6 the Danube and Tisza and other most noble springs, abounding in good fish, in which land there lived the Slavs, Bulgarians, Vlachs, and the shepherds of the Romans.7 for after the death of King Attila, the Romans said the land of pannonia was pastureland because their flocks grazed in the land of pannonia. And rightly was the land of pannonia said to be the pastureland of the Romans, for now too the Romans graze on the goods of Hungary.8 what more?

1 The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle, writing of a campaign in alliance with the Hungarians, distinguished between the common warriors, who rode on horses “in the Tatar way,” and prince Danilo, who “rode next to the King of Hungary” and whose mount was “in the Rus’ fashion” (po obychaju rusku, pSRl 2: 814). what the distinction implies can only be speculated upon.

10 THE SEVEN DUKES Of THE CUMANS
prince álmos and his chief men, taking counsel among themselves, agreed to the request of the princes of the Rus’ and made peace with them. Then the princes of the Rus’, namely of Kiev and Suzdal’, lest they be expelled from their homes, gave their sons as hostages to prince álmos and sent with them 10,000 marks and a thousand horses with saddles and bridles decorated in Rus’ fashion,1 and a hundred Cuman boys and forty camels for carrying loads, numberless pelts of ermine and calabar and many other gifts beyond count.2 Then the afore-named dukes of the Cumans, namely Ed, Edemen, Etu, Böngér, father of Bors, Ócsád, father of Örsúr, Vajta, from whom the kindred of Baracska descends, and Ketel, father of Alaptolma, when they saw the kindness with which prince álmos treated the Rus’, prostrated themselves at his feet and of their own will subjected themselves to prince álmos, saying: “from today we choose you as our lord and master until the last generation and where your fortune leads you, there will we follow you.”3 what they had said in words to prince álmos, they moreover confirmed with a sworn pledge in pagan manner and, in the same way, prince álmos and his chief men bound themselves to them with a sworn pledge. Then these seven dukes of the Cumans together with their wives and sons and a great host agreed to come to pannonia. Similarly, many of the Rus’, joining prince álmos, came with him to pannonia. Their descendants still live today in various places in Hungary.4
2 The description of gifts here and later owes much to the similar passages in the Historia Alexandri, 1, pp. 68; 2, pp. 122, 124. 3 The wording is almost identical with that of álmos’s election, above, ch. 5, p. 17.

Then prince álmos and the other leading persons who are called the Hetumoger, and the dukes of the Cumans with their kinsmen, servants and maidservants, marched from Kiev and, led by the Rus’ from Kiev, came to the city of Volodimer.1 The prince of Volodimer and his chief men proceeded with diverse precious gifts to the borders of the country to receive prince álmos and voluntarily opened the city of Volodimer to him. And prince álmos stayed in that place with all his men for three weeks and in the third week the prince of Volodimer gave to prince álmos as hostages his two sons together with all the sons of his chief men and, in addition, he presented both to the prince and his leading men 2000 marks of silver and a hundred marks of refined gold, with innumerable furs and cloaks, and 300 horses with saddles and bridles, and twenty-five camels, and a thousand oxen for carrying loads, and other countless gifts. in the fourth week, prince álmos came with his men to Halich and there he chose a place of repose for himself and his men. when the prince of Halich heard this, he with all his men went barefoot to prince álmos and presented diverse gifts for his pleasure and, having opened the gate of the city of Halich, he welcomed him as his lord and he gave as hostage his only son together with the sons of the leading men of the kingdom and, in addition, he gave ten of the very best Arab steeds2 and 300 horses with saddles and bridles, and 3000 marks of silver and 200 marks of gold and the most noble raiment both for the prince and all his warriors as well. After prince álmos had taken repose in Halich for a month, the prince of Halich and his other companions, whose sons had been given as hostages, told prince álmos and his noblemen to descend westwards beyond the Havas [Mountain] into the land of pannonia. for they said to them that the land

there was very good and that there flowed there the most noble springs, whose names were, as we said above, the Danube, Tisza, Váh, Maros/Mureş, Körös/Criş, Timiş and others, that it had first been the land of King Attila and that after his death the leaders of the Romans had taken possession of the land of pannonia up to the Danube, where they had stationed their shepherds. But that the great Kean,1 prince of Bulgaria, grandfather of prince Salan,2 had taken possession of the land that lies between the Danube and the Tisza, as far as the borders of the Rus’ and the poles, and had made the Slavs and Bulgarians live there. The land between the Tisza and igyfon wood,3 that lies towards Transylvania,4 from the Mureş River up to the Someş River had been occupied by prince Marót,5 whose grandson was called Ménmarót by the Hungarians, for he had many concubines6; and the peoples that are called Kozár7 inhabited that land. And that a certain prince called Galad8 coming from the castle of Vidin had with the help of the Cumans taken possession of the land from the river Mureş up to the castle of Orşova. from his line was born Ajtony, whom, a long time later, at the time of the holy King Stephen, Csanád, son of Doboka and nephew of the king, slew in his castle beside the Mureş River because he was rebellious to the king in all his doings.9 To him the aforesaid king gave for his good service a wife and the castle10 of
6 The prefix ‘Mén’ (in fact originating from the Turkic for ‘great’) is implicitly explained by the author by the reference to concubines, thereby implying a derivation from the Hungarian mén ‘stallion’.
7 The name Kozar has been variously explained as “Khazar,” as a corruption of cozlones, meaning “people of Kaliz” (i.e., of Khwarezm), or as a word meaning “goatherd.” There is no evidence for the existence of such a group of people, save—as usual with Anonymus—a number of place names. See Göckenjan, Hilfsvölker, pp. 40–1. 8 Galad’s name came probably from the location Gilád (now Ghilad, Romania).
9 The story of Csanád and his defeat of Ajtony is given in the legend of St Gerald (SRH 2, pp. 489–92). There, Csanád is identified as a close retainer of Ajtony who changed over to Stephen’s side, not as a relative of the king.
10 According to the same legend, Csanád was granted Marosvár, now Cenadu Vechi. The same source charged Ajtony with “having seven wives” (cited as a sign of pagan immorality). Anonymus may imply that one of them was given to Csanád but the text is ambiguous.

They extolled to them the fertility of their land and told how, after the death of King Attila, the great Kean, forbear of prince Salan and prince of Bulgaria, advancing with the aid and counsel of the emperor of the Greeks, had occupied that land, how the Slavs themselves had been led from the land of Bulgaria to the border of the Rus’ and how Salan, their duke, now guarded himself and his people, and how much power he had among his neighbors.

Then prince álmos and his men, entering Ung castle, made great sacrifices to the immortal gods and feasted for four days. And on the fourth day, having had counsel and taken an oath from all his men, prince álmos while yet still living appointed his son, árpád, as leader and master,3 and he was called árpád, prince of Hunguaria, and from Ung all his warriors were called Hunguar

The envoys of prince Salan, coming to the castle of zemplín and having crossed the Bodrog River, reached prince árpád on the next day, and on the third day they greeted prince árpád with the words of their lord and relayed to prince árpád his message. prince árpád, having listened to the embassy of the haughty duke Salan, replied not haughtily, but humbly, saying: “Although my forbear, the most powerful King Attila, had the land which lies between the Danube and the Tisza as far as the border of the Bulgarians, which he, your master, has, i nevertheless—not because i fear that i may be unable to withstand the Greeks and Bulgarians, but rather for the friendship of Salan, your duke—ask from my heritage1 one little place for my flocks, namely the land up to the Sajó River. in addition i ask your lord to send me of his grace two small bottles filled with the water of the Danube and one bag of herbs of the sands of Alpár so that i may test whether the herbs of the sands of Alpár are sweeter than the herbs of those of the Scythians, that is Dentumoger, and whether the waters of the Danube are better than the waters of the Don.” Having given this message to them, he enriched them with diverse gifts and having won their goodwill he ordered them home. Then prince árpád, having taken counsel, likewise sent his envoys to prince Salan and sent to him twelve white horses and twelve camels and twelve Cuman boys and, for the princess, twelve most nimble Rus’ girls and twelve ermine pelts and twelve sables and twelve cloaks of woven gold.2 And in that embassy were sent out of the more noble persons Ónd, father of Ete; secondly Ketel, father of Alaptolma; and, thirdly, they sent the most valiant warrior, Tarcal by name, for reconnaissance, to inspect the quality of the land and, returning speedily, to report to his lord, prince árpád.

15 THE CASTlE Of KOMARNO
The envoys of prince árpád—Ónd, father of Ete; secondly Ketel, father of Alaptolma; and Tarcal the Cuman warrior (whose line perished with him)—coming to the Bodrog River, swam across at that place where a little river coming from Sátorhalom, flows into the Bodrog. After having crossed the Bodrog River, when they were apparently happily crossing the aforesaid little river, then by the swell of the waters and with his horse blundering, Ketel sank into the water and narrowly escaped a hapless death with the help of his companions.1 Then that river was jokingly called by Ketel’s companions Ketelpataka.2 Afterwards prince árpád gave by his grace to Ketel the whole land with its inhabitants from Sátorhalom to the Tolcsva River, and he gave not just this but more besides because, after prince árpád had conquered the whole land of pannonia, he gave to Ketel for his most faithful service a great land beside the Danube at the confluence of the Váh River. There Alaptolma, Ketel’s son, later built a castle that is called Komárom. for servicing that castle, he gave two thirds both of the people he had brought with him and those he had obtained from the prince.3 A long time later, Ketel and his son, Tolma, were buried there in pagan manner, but his descendants had that land, which is now called Ketelpataka, to the times of King Andrew, son of ladislas the Bald.4 Nevertheless, King Andrew exchanged that land with the descendants of Ketel for two reasons: first, because it was suitable to kings for hunting; secondly, because his wife liked to dwell in those parts because they were closer to her native soil, as she was

4 King Andrew i, 1046–60, was in fact the son of Vazul, not of his brother ladislas Szár (‘the Bald’). This genealogical “mistake” goes back to the early part of the Hungarian Chronicle (ch. 69; SRH 1, p. 321), written at the time when the line of Vazul was ruling the country, where the author sought to distance the dynasty from an ignominiously blinded and maimed ancestor.

Then Ónd, Ketel and Tarcal, crossing the wood beside the Bodrog River, riding as if wanting to get a prize,3 racing on the fleetest horses, climbed the summit of a high mountain. Tarcal, the most valiant warrior, preceding all, reached the top of the mountain first and, from that time till now, they have called that mountain Mount Tarcal.4 Then these three lords, viewing as far as may the human eye the land on all sides from the summit of the mountain, loved it more than can be said and in that place they made a great celebration5 in pagan manner, killing the plumpest horse. Tarcal, having obtained leave from his companions, as he was a courageous man and faithful in arms, returned with his warriors to prince árpád in order to report to him the usefulness of that land. And he did so. Ónd and Ketel, riding a most speedy course, marched from Mount Tarcal and found on the third day prince Salan in the castle of Alpár beside the Tisza River. They greeted him on behalf of árpád and, on the next day, after entering his court, they presented the gifts that they had brought with them and relayed to him the message of prince árpád. prince Salan, having seen the gifts and heard what they and his own men had to say,

Having received leave, Bors marched out with good fortune and, having gathered a throng of peasants,4 he built a castle beside the Bódva River that is called by that people Borsod, because it was small.5 Bors, having taken the sons of the inhabitants as hostages and putting boundary markers along the mountains of Tatry, returned to prince árpád and there was great joy in the court of the prince at the return of Bors.

After spending several days, prince árpád, having taken the advice of his noblemen, sent envoys to the castle of Biharia, to prince Ménmarót, asking him, by right of his forbear, King Attila, to give him the land from the Someş River to the border of Nyírség, up to the Mezeş Gates,2 and he sent him gifts, just as he had previously sent to Salan, prince of Titel. And in that embassy were sent two of the most valiant warriors: Ősbő, father of Szalók, and Velek, from whose progeny Bishop Torda is descended.3 These were most noble by birth, like the others that came from the Scythian land and who had followed prince álmos with a great host of peoples.

Still, he so replied, saying: “Tell árpád, prince of Hungary, your lord, that we owe him as a friend to a friend in all things he needs because a guest is a person short in many things.4 But the land that he seeks

Then Ősbő and Velek, the envoys of prince árpád, hastened speedily to their lord and, upon arrival, reported to their lord, prince árpád, the message of Ménmarót. Upon hearing this, prince árpád and his nobles were moved by anger and they immediately ordered an army to be sent against him. Then they decided that Tas, father of lél, and Szabolcs, son of Előd, (from whom the Csák kindred descends), and Tétény, father of Horka, grandfather of Gyula and zombor (from whom the Maglód kindred descends), should go. Having been granted leave by prince árpád, they marched off with no small army and swam unopposed across the Tisza at the ford of lád. On the next day, they began to ride along the Tisza towards the Szamos/Someş River and they encamped at that place where is now Szabolcs. At that place, almost all the inhabitants of the land surrendered of their own will and, throwing themselves at their feet, gave their sons as hostages lest they should suffer any harm. for almost all the peoples feared them and only a few managed by flight to escape them and, coming to Ménmarót, to announce what they [the Hungarians] had done.

at the bidding of the people subjugated to his lord, prince árpád, caused to be founded a market between the Nyírség and the Tisza, to which also he assigned his name, so that it is called even now Tas Market.1 After Szabolcs and Tas marched on from there, they reached the castle of Satu Mare and besieging the castle over three days of fighting they won victory. On the fourth day, entering the castle, they sent those warriors of Ménmarót that they could catch there to the most foul depths of the dungeon, taken in iron fetters, and they took the sons of those dwelling there as hostages. Having left the castle full of warriors, they turned towards the Mezeş Gates.
22 NYíRSéG
Tétény and his son, Horka, riding through the Nyírség, conquered a great number of people, from the woods of the Nyírség up to the Omsó-ér. And thus ascending, they arrived at zalău, with none raising a hand against them, because prince Ménmarót and his men did not dare to fight them but began to defend the Criş River. Then Tétény and his son, Horka, marching on from zalău came to the area of Mezeş, where Szabolcs and Tas were, and, when they espied each other, they rejoiced with great joy2 and, having made a feast, each one extolled himself for his victory. When the morning was come,3 Szabolcs, Tas, and Tétény, taking counsel, decided that the border of the realm of prince árpád should be at the Mezeş Gates. At their command, the dwellers of the land built stone gateways and a great obstacle of trees along the boundary of the realm. Then these three aforenamed men sent through faithful messengers word of all their deeds to prince árpád and his leading men. when this was reported to prince árpád and his great men4 they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and held a celebration in pagan

Thus gladdened, prince árpád and his leading men solemnly feasted for a whole week and almost every day they got drunk on account of such glad news. Having heard this, prince árpád and his men marched out from Szerencs and they encamped beside the Sajó River, from the Tisza to the Hernád River.
23 THE ViCTORY Of TAS, SzABOlCS, AND TéTéNY
Tas, Szabolcs, and Tétény, when they saw that God had given them a great victory and that they had subjected almost all the nations of that land to their lord, became greatly exalted 2 over the inhabitants of that land, and as there was no one [opposing them],3 they stayed there for some days until they had reinforced the boundaries of the country with the strongest obstacles.

This was later so done, for the posterity of Tétény held the land of Transylvania up to the time of the holy King Stephen
4 The following four chapters were clearly added later (most likely, by the author) as they interrupt the story of Ménmarót and also have other inconsistencies, such as calling Tétény, who in ch. 6 (above, p. 19) is identified as ancestor of the otherwise unknown Maglód kindred, as a forbear of the Transylvanian prince Gyula (in ch. 27, p. 65, below). The chapter title is also peculiar, for in ch. 11 (above, p. 33) Transylvania is called Erdeuelu (on which, see n. 4, ibid.) but here Ultrasilvana.

and would have held it longer, had the younger Gyula with his two sons, Bolya and Bonyha, wished to be Christians and not always opposed the holy king, as will be said in the following.1
25 THE RESOURCEfUlNESS Of TéTéNY
The aforesaid Tétény, a most resourceful man, sent a certain astute man, father Agmánd Apafarkas,2 to spy out for him by going around secretly the quality and fertility of the land of Transylvania and what its inhabitants were like, so that he might, if he could, go to war with them, for Tétény wished thereby to acquire a name and land for himself. As our minstrels say: “All the land they can they take, and a name for themselves make.” 3 what more? when father Agmánd, Tétény’s scout, circling like a fox, viewed, as far as the human eye may, the goodness and fertility of the land and its inhabitants, he loved it more than can be said and returned most swiftly to his lord. when he arrived, he spoke much to his lord of the goodness of that land: that that land was washed by the best rivers, whose names and merits he listed, that in their sands they gathered gold and that the gold of that land was the best, and that they mined there salt and had salt crystals. The inhabitants of that land were the basest of the whole world, because they were Vlachs4 and Slavs, and because they had nothing else for arms than bows and arrows.5 Their prince, Gyalu, was not steadfast and did not have around him good warriors who dared stand against the daring of the Hungarians, because they had suffered many injuries from the Cumans and pechenegs.6
in Transylvania is recorded already somewhat before the author’s times, in the late twelfth century.
5 Note that in other contexts the notary praises the Hungarians for fighting with bows and arrows.
6 The pechenegs were a steppe people who settled in Hungary and in many other places throughout South-Eastern Europe from the tenth century onwards; see András pálóczi-Horváth, Pechenegs, Cumans, Iasians, trans. Timothy wilkinson (Budapest: Corvina, 1989).

Then Tétény, having heard of the goodness of that land, sent his envoys to prince árpád to ask his permission to cross the forest to fight prince Gyalu. prince árpád, having taken counsel, commended Tétény’s wish and he gave him permission to cross the forest to fight prince Gyalu. when Tétény heard this from an envoy, he readied himself with his warriors and, having left his companions there, marched eastwards beyond the forest against Gyalu, prince of the Vlachs. Gyalu, prince of Transylvania, hearing of his arrival, gathered his army and rode speedily towards him in order to stop him at the Mezeş Gates, but Tétény, crossing the forest in one day, arrived at the Almaş River. Then both armies came upon each other, with the river lying between them. prince Gyalu planned to stop them there with his archers.
27 THE DEATH Of GYAlU
When the morning was come, before daybreak, Tétény divided his army in two and he sent one part a little way upstream so that, having crossed the river, they might attack while Gyalu’s warriors were still unawares. This was done. And because they had an easy crossing, both forces arrived on the field at the same time and they fought fiercely, but the warriors of prince Gyalu were defeated and many of them slain and more captured. when Gyalu, their prince, saw this, he fled for his life along with a few men. As he was in flight, hastening to his castle beside the Someş River, Tétény’s warriors, boldly pursuing prince Gyalu, slew him beside the Căpuş River.1 Then the inhabitants of the land, seeing the death of their lord, giving the right hand2 of their own free will, chose for them

Then, when Tas and Szabolcs sought to enter the prince’s court, the prince sent in advance all his warriors to meet them and he thus received them with great joy and, as it is the custom of good lords to prize their faithful men, he had them eat almost every day at his table2 and gave them many gifts.

Afterwards, prince árpád and his noblemen, marching on from there, came to the Nyárád River and they encamped beside the brooks at that place which is now called Kács, where he gave a great land to Ócsád, father of Örsúr; and his son, Örsúr, later built a castle at the head of the river, which is now called the castle of Örsúr.1 Thence prince árpád and his men, marching on, reached the Eger River and, having built huts, stayed there some days and the mountain upon which they made a leafy shade for the prince, they called Színhalom and their encampments were from the Ostoros River to the castle of poroszló. Next, marching ahead, they arrived at the zagyva River and they encamped along the banks of the river from the Tisza to the forest of Mátra, and they conquered all the inhabitants of the land from the Körös to the zagyva River and to the forest of Spiš. Then prince árpád gave a great land in the forest of Mátra to Ed and Edemen, where afterwards, pata, their nephew, built a castle, of whose line came a long time later King Samuel, who on account of his piety was called Aba.2

To the warriors going on campaign, he assigned as chief men and commanders3 the two sons of his uncle Hülek, zovárd and Kadocsa, as well as

Huba, one of the leading persons. Then these three lords, having obtained leave from prince árpád, marched out from that place which is called pásztó, riding along the Hangony River, and they crossed the river near the Sajó River. from there they marched through the region of the castle of Gemer and reached the mountain of Bolhád and, arriving thence at the region of Nógrád, they reached the Galga River. Marching from there, they went along the bank of the Danube and, crossing the Verőce River, they encamped beside the ipoly River. And because divine grace was in them, all feared them and they feared them most greatly because they had heard that prince árpád, son of prince álmos, was descended of the line of King Attila. Then all the Slavs, the inhabitants of the land, who were formerly prince Salan’s, for fear of them subordinated themselves to them of their own free will, with no one raising a hand. Thus, with great fear and trembling, they served them as if they were their lords of old. Then zovárd, Kadocsa and Huba—from whom the nimble Szemere1 is descended—when they saw the many people subjugated to them without war, made a great feast and they gave diverse gifts to the higher ranking inhabitants of the land, who had given their sons as hostages, and they brought them with gentle words under the rule of prince árpád without war. They enlisted them on their campaign; their sons, however, they took as hostages and sent them with diverse gifts to prince árpád, on account of which the prince and his noblemen were happier than usual, and they gave many gifts to the messengers who brought the glad news.

on the plain beside a small earthen castle called Várad.1 Having captured that castle, they stayed there for three days, awaiting the arrival of Bors, son of Böngér, whom prince árpád had sent with a great army to support them. On the fourth day, when Bors had come to them with a strong force, all the inhabitants of the land feared them and none dared raise a hand against them. Then these four lords, having taken counsel among themselves, at the bidding of those of the inhabitants that were faithful to them, decided that the third part of the army should go with the inhabitants of the land to the forest of zvolen, to make strong fortifications on the border of the realm both of stone and wood lest at any time the Czechs or the poles should enter their realm to rob and plunder. Then, by common counsel, Bors, son of Böngér, was sent out to that end with his warriors. As they rode along the Hron River, a stag in flight sped up the tops of the mountains before them, which Bors, pursuing most speedily, killed on the peak of the mountains with shots of his arrows.2 Then Bors, as he looked round about upon those mountains, thought to build a castle there and having at once gathered a good many men of the castle, he built a very strong castle on the top of one of the higher mountains, to which he gave his own name, so that it is called the castle of Bors.3 And thence he proceeded with his armies to the forest of zvolen and he ordered a very great fortification to be made of stone, which is now called the castle of “Borséd” zvolen.4
1 Now Tekovský Hrádok, Slovakia. Anonymus understood here, as before, the ending –d to constitute a diminutive, which is why he calls Várad a castellum (‘small castle’)
2 A stag pointing to a place for a castle or church is a widespread motif; Anonymus may have known the passage in the Hungarian Chronicle (ch. 124; SRH 1, p. 394–5) where a miraculous stag pointed out to the dukes Géza and ladislas the place for the foundation of the church of Vác. An even more likely model could have been the Excidium Troie, ch. 37, p. 77 (whence the actual words here are borrowed); cf. also Historia Alexandri, 1, p. 68. 3 Now Starý Tekov, Slovakia.
4 Most likely the partially excavated stone castle pusztavár (pustý Hrad), near zvolen, close to a brook called Borzovo.

35 THE CiTY Of NiTRA
After Bors’s departure, zovárd, Kadocsa, and Huba, marching on with all their armies from the castle that is called Várad, encamped beyond the Turčok wood beside the Žitava River. The next day, they sent scouts, men whom they knew to be daring, to cross the Nitra River to see whether they could get across to the city of Nitra without a battle. when they had arrived by the swiftest course at the Tormoš brook, where it flows into the Nitra brook, they saw the inhabitants of that province, Slavs and Czechs, opposing them supported by the duke of the Czechs, because after the death of King Attila, the duke of the Czechs had seized the land which lies between the Váh and the Hron, from the Danube to the Morava River, and made it one duchy.1 At that time zobor was made duke of Nitra2 by the grace of the duke of the Czechs.
36 THE SCOUTS SENT OUT BY THE DUKES
when those scouts who had been sent by zovárd and Kadocsa recognized that the Slavs and Czechs were unable to withstand them, they released their arrows three times over them and killed some of them with the shots of their arrows. when the Slavs and Czechs whom zobor had assigned to the defense saw how those who were called the Hetumoger used such arms, they feared greatly, because such weaponry had never been seen by them,3 and they immediately told zobor, their lord, and the other leaders of the province.
2 On the possible existence of a “duchy of Nitra” see Alexander T. Ruttkay, “Neutra (Nitra) und zobor,” in Alfried wieczorek and Hans-Martin Hinz, eds., Europas Mitte um 1000. Beiträge zur Geschichte, Kunst und Archäologie, 2 vols. (Stuttgart: Theiss, 2000), vol. 2, pp. 628–32. zobor’s name in fact comes from Mt zobor near Nitra.

37 THE BATTlE Of THE DUKES Of áRpáD
Then zobor, having heard this, went supported by the Czechs to oppose them with an armed host. when both armies arrived at the Nitra River, zovárd, Kadocsa and Huba wished to cross the river, but zobor, duke of Nitra, and his warriors fought them for a very long time and were in no way willing to concede the crossing. And as they fought lengthily together, the Hungarians killed many of the Czechs and Slavs with arrow shots, but for three days the Hungarians were in no way able to make a crossing on account of the swell of the waters. At last, on the fourth day, the Czechs and all the Nitra Slavs, seeing the daring of the Hungarians and finding the shots of the arrows unendurable, fell to flight and to save their lives most speedily shut themselves up in great fear in the city of Nitra. zovárd, Kadocsa and Huba and the other warriors chased them to the city and some they killed, some they wounded, and others they captured. zobor, their duke, who while in flight sought to fight them, was struck by Kadocsa’s lance and, having been captured, was put in custody; the others, shut up in the city, waited dumbstruck. The next day, zovárd, Kadocsa and Huba with an armed host of armies began bravely to storm the city of Nitra in many ways. And God gave them a great victory and they entered the city fighting and the blood of many foes was shed there by them. Then they, moved by anger, taking zobor, the duke of that province, whom they had captured two days before, onto a high mountain, hanged him from a noose, whence that mountain is still called Mount zobor. And on account of that deed, all the men of that country feared them and all the noblemen gave their sons to them as hostages and all the nations of that land, as far as the Váh River, subjected themselves to them. And because the grace of God went before them, not only did they conquer them but also took all their castles, the names of which are up until now: Šintava, Hlohovec, Trenčín, Beckov and Bana1; and having assigned guards to the castles they went up to the Morava River,

and they fixed and reinforced with obstacles the bounds of the realm of the Hungarians as far as Borona and Saruvar.1 Victory won, they returned to prince árpád, and took with them all the faithless men of that land bound in iron fetters. when zovárd, Kadocsa and Huba came safe and sound with all their captives to prince árpád, great rejoicing was made in the court of the duke. prince árpád, upon the counsel and bidding of his noblemen, having taken an oath from the faithless men, gave lands in diverse places to the aforesaid faithless men who had been taken from the districts of Nitra, lest at any time they should become yet more faithless and, returning to their homes, do harm to those faithful to him who were living on the confines of Nitra. And at the same glad event, prince árpád made Huba ispán of Nitra and of other castles, and he gave him land to own along the Žitava River as far as the Turčok wood.

The Hungarian Chronicle (ch. 28, SRH 1, pp. 288–90) contains a long story about the Hungarians “purchasing” land from the Moravian prince Svatopluk, giving him a white horse in return for grass and water. A similar symbolic purchase of land is reported in widukind’s Sachsengeschichte i: 5, ed. paul Hirsch et al., MGH SSrG 60 (Hanover: Hahn, 1935), p. 6. The story may have reached the author from these or a surviving legendary tradition of the Hungarians.

2 This name may come from a village near Komárom, but it has also been suggested that lél’s blowing the trumpet has something to do with the Hungarian word for breath or breathing (lehel). A captain with this name is also recorded in the mid-tenth century (see below, p. 119).

and said to comfort his warriors1: “O Scythians, who by the arrogance of the Bulgarians are called Hungarians after the castle of Ung, do not forget your swords for fear of the Greeks and lose your good name. Let us then fight strongly and valiantly against the Greeks and Bulgarians who are as our women and let us thus fear the host of the Greeks as a host of women.” Having heard this, his warriors were much comforted, and at once lél, son of Tas, sounded a trumpet2 and Bulcsú, son of Bogát,3 with standard raised, began at the front of the army to fight with the Greeks. The armies of the two foes joined in battle and they began to fight each other fiercely and, when the whole army of prince árpád entered the fighting against the Greeks, very many Greeks and Bulgarians were slain. The aforesaid Prince Salan, when he saw his men failing in battle, took to flight and hastened for the safety of his life to Belgrade.4 The Greeks and Bulgarians, struck by fear of the Hungarians, forgot which way they had come and, turning to flight, sought to save their lives by swimming across the Tisza, thinking it a little river, but such fear and fright overcame them that for fear of the Hungarians nearly all were killed in the Tisza River, so that barely any remained to report the bad news to the emperor. Hence that place where the Greeks were killed is from that day until now called the ford of the Greeks.5
3 Bulcsú is one of the few persons also mentioned in other sources. in the DAi ch. 40 (pp. 178–9) he is called “the karchas Boultzous” son of Kalis, and karchas is explained as the title of a dignitary. He was baptized by the emperor in 948 in Byzantium and was executed after the defeat at lechfeld, see below, p. 119.
4 The historic Hungarian name for Belgrade, Nándorfehérvár, retains the association with the Bulgarians, called nándor in old Hungarian.
5 The region of this ford was in fact the property of the Orthodox monastery of St Demetrius (Srpska Mitrovica) in the twelfth century, and several estates of the monastery were referred to as ‘Greek.’

Translators of Roman legal texts often retain ius, as it implies law, justice, rights along with all their connotations. Modern English does not distinguish lex from ius, Gesetz from Recht, or loi from droit, which may explain the generally supine Anglo

40 THE ViCTORY Of pRiNCE áRpáD
with victory won, prince árpád and his warriors marched from there to the pool that is called Körtvélytó, and they stayed there beside the wood of Gyümölcsény for thirty-four days and in that place the prince and his noblemen ordered all the customary laws of the realm and all its rights,1 how they should serve the prince and his leading men, and how they should judge any crime committed. There the prince gave to his noblemen who had come with him diverse villages with all their inhabitants, and the place where all these matters were ordered the Hungarians called according to their language Szer, because here was ordered the whole business of the realm.2 The prince gave that place to Ónd, father of Ete, from the Tisza to the pool of Botva and from Körtvélytó to the sand of Alpár. Some time later, Ete, son of Ónd, having gathered a host of Slavs, had built between the castle of Alpár and the Bőd ford a very strong earthwork that the Slavs in their language called Csongrád, which means ‘black castle.’3
41 áRpáD’S MARCH
Afterwards, prince árpád and his noblemen, marching from there, reached Titel, subjugating the people. Then, marching on, they reached the ford of Slankamen and they put the whole people living between the Tisza and the Danube under their yoke. Marching from there they reached the region of Bodrog and they encamped beside the Vajas River, and in those regions the prince gave a great
Saxon attitude towards the law and authority in general. On the special meaning of ius in medieval Hungaro-latin, see above, n. 3, p. 53.
2 Traditionally identified with Szer/pusztaszer in Co. Csongrád. ‘Szer,’ primarily meaning ‘place, area,’ also retains the meaning of ‘acquire’ or ‘obtain’, as in the construction szert tesz valamire or to ‘arrange something,’ or to ‘get something done, as in ‘szerét ejti’. The notary may have associated the place name with one these words. 3 The notary’s etymology is correct.

Then prince árpád and his leading men, having taken counsel, decided that they should send over the Danube to Belgrade an army after prince Salan. As the army’s chief men and commanders were appointed lél, son of Tas, Bulcsú, son of Bogát, and Botond, son of Kölpény. They, having obtained leave from prince árpád, rode off and crossed unopposed the Danube at that place where the Sava River flows into the Danube, and, marching from there, they began to ride against the city of Belgrade. Then the prince of the Bulgarians, a blood relation of prince Salan, went with a great army to fight against them with the Greeks in support. The next day, both armies were arranged on the plain beside the bank of the Danube. lél, having raised a standard with his device,1 and Bulcsú, son of Bogát, sounding the trumpets of war, began immediately to fight. The forces of the two foes engaged one another and they began to fight fiercely,2 and very many Greeks and Bulgarians were slain and some of them captured. Seeing his men thus failing in battle, the prince of Bulgaria, fleeing for his life entered the city of Belgrade. Then, with victory won, lél, Bolcsú and Botond encamped a little lower on the field beside the Danube, and all the captured Bulgarians and Greeks were led before them, whom they sent bound in iron to prince árpád in Hungary.

They, inclining to peace and taking in pledge the prince’s own son, departed with many treasures of Bulgaria and left the prince go un

Marching on from there, they arrived at the sea and they subjugated effectively and peacefully3 all the nations of that land to the rule of árpád, prince of the Hungarians, and they took the city of Split and conquered all Croatia. Marching on from there, they took the sons of the noblemen as hostages and returned to Hungary to prince árpád. if you do not wish to read these presents4 on their wars and brave deeds, then you may believe the gabbling rhymes of minstrels and the spurious tales of peasants who have not forgotten the brave deeds and wars of the Hungarians even to this day. Some indeed say that they reached Constantinople and that Botond cut the Golden Gate of Constantinople with his axe.5 But as i have found this in no book written by historians, and have heard it only in the spurious tales of peasants, i do not, therefore, propose to write it in the present work.

having crossed the Sava, they took the castle of zagreb and, riding from there, they took požega and Vukovar. Marching out from there, crossing the Danube at the ford of Geréc, they arrived at the court of prince árpád. when lél, Bulcsú, and Botond and the other warriors had returned after a year to prince árpád safe and sound with a great victory, great joy was made throughout the prince’s whole court and they had a great feast and the Hungarians feasted sumptuously every day1 together with various nations. And the neighboring nations, hearing of their deeds, flocked to prince árpád and, as truly faithful subjects, they served him with great diligence and very many guests came to make their home there.2

After this, prince árpád marched from those parts where now the castle of Bodrog is, and he descended along the Danube to the Great island.3 They encamped beside the island, and prince árpád and his noblemen entering the island, having seen the fertility and richness of the place and the protection given by the waters of the Danube, loved that place more than can be said, and they decided that the island should belong to the prince and each of the noble persons should have there a court and village. forthwith, prince árpád ordered the assembled craftsmen to make fine princely homes and he ordered all his horses, exhausted by long days, brought there to graze and he appointed as master of his horse a certain Cuman, a most skilled man called Csepel, and, as Csepel, master of the horse, remained there, that island is called to the present day by the name of Csepel. prince árpád and his noblemen stayed there with their

Then, leaving their wives there, they decided by common counsel, to quit the island in order to go beyond the Danube and subjugate the land of pannonia,1 make war against the Carinthians, and prepare to go to the march of lombardy. However, before doing that, they decided to send an army against prince Glad, who held power from the Mureş River to the castle of palanka, of whose line a long time later was descended Ajtony, whom Csanád killed.2 To this end, zovárd, Kadocsa and Vajta were sent who, having obtained leave, rode out and crossed the Tisza at Kanjiža and halted along the Csesztreg River.3 And no enemy appeared before them who dared raise his hand against them, because fear of them had taken hold of all the men of that land. Marching on from there, they reached the region of Bega and stayed there for two weeks while they conquered all the inhabitants of that land from the Mureş to the Timiş River and they received their sons as hostages. Then, moving the army on, they came to the Timiş River and encamped beside the ford of foeni4 and when they sought to cross the Timiş’s flow, there came to oppose them Glad, of whose line Ajtony descended, the prince of that country, with a great army of horsemen and foot soldiers, supported by Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs. The next day, because, with the Timiş River lying between them, neither army had been at all able to cross over to the other, zovárd enjoined his brother, Kadocsa, to go lower down with half his army and try to cross in any way in order to attack the enemy. forthwith Kadocsa, obeying his brother’s commands, riding with half the army, went very swiftly lower down and, as God’s grace was before them, he had an easy crossing. when one part of the army of the Hungarians was with Kadocsa on the far side and the other half with zovárd on this side, the Hungarians

And because God with His grace went before the Hungarians, He gave them a great victory and their enemies fell before them as bundles of hay before reapers.1 in that battle two dukes of the Cumans and three kneses2 of the Bulgarians were slain, and Glad, their duke, escaped in flight but all his army, melting like wax before flame,3 was destroyed at the point of the sword. Then zovárd, Kadocsa and Vajta, having won victory, marching from there, came to the borders of the Bulgarians and encamped beside the ponjavica River. prince Glad, having fled, as we said above, for fear of the Hungarians, entered the castle of Kovin and, on the third day, zovárd, Kadocsa and Vajta (from whom the Baracska kindred descends), having arranged their army, began to fight against the castle of Kovin. when Glad, their duke, saw this, he sent to seek peace with them and of his own will delivered up the castle with diverse gifts. Going from there, they took the castle of Orşova and lived there for a whole month. They sent Vajta with a third of the army and the sons of the inhabitants given as hostages back to prince árpád and sent, moreover, their envoys to him so that he might give them leave to go to Greece so that they might conquer the whole of Macedonia from the Danube to the Black Sea. for the mind of the Hungarians at that time desired nothing else but to seize lands, conquer nations and practice the work of war. for at that time the Hungarians rejoiced like the horseleech4 at the shedding of human blood and, had they not done so, they would not have left so many good lands to their descendants. what more? Vajta and their envoys reached prince árpád and they related to him their deeds. The prince praised their work and granted zovárd and Kadocsa leave to go to Greece and occupy land for him,5 and he gave Vajta for his most faithful service a great land beside the Tisza by the name of Taraš. Then the envoys of zovárd and his brother, Kadocsa, having received leave, returned joyfully to their lords.

After a few days had passed, zovárd and Kadocsa with their whole army, emblazoned standards aloft, crossed the water of the Danube and captured the castle of Braničevo, after which they went to the castle of Serdica. Hearing this, the people of the Bulgarians and Macedonians feared greatly facing them. Then all the inhabitants of that land sent their envoys with many gifts to surrender the land to them and hand over their sons as hostages. zovárd and Kadocsa, favoring peace and taking their gifts and hostages, let them go in peace, as if they were their own people, and riding beyond the Gate of Basil, they took the castle of King philip; then they conquered the whole land up to the city of Neopatras,1 and they had in their power the whole land from the city of Durrës to the land of Serbia. And zovárd took to himself a wife in that land and the people, who are now called “Sobamogera,” remained after Duke zovárd’s death in Greece and they were thus called soba by the Greeks, that is stupid people, because with their lord dead they did not take the way home.2

Next day, prince árpád and all his leading men with all the warriors of Hungary entered the city of King Attila and they saw all the royal palaces, some ruined to the foundations, others not, and they admired beyond measure the stone buildings1 and were happier than can be told that they had deserved to take without fighting the city of King Attila, of whose line prince árpád descended. They feasted every day with great joy in the palace of King Attila, sitting alongside one another, and all the melodies and sweet sounds of zithers and pipes along with all the songs of minstrels were presented to them. Dishes and drinks were borne to the prince and his noblemen in golden vessels, to the serving men and peasants in silver vessels, because all the treasures of the neighboring countries God had given into their hands, and they lived lavishly and magnificently with all the guests that came to them. prince árpád gave great lands and properties to the guests staying with them, and, when they heard this, many guests thronged to him and gladly stayed with him. Then, on account of their happiness, prince árpád and his men stayed in the city of King Attila for twenty days and in the presence of the prince all the warriors of Hungary daily made a very great tournament mounted on destriers with shields and lances, and the other young men played in pagan manner with bows and arrows,2 on account of which prince árpád was made most happy and he gave to all his warriors diverse gifts both of gold and silver along with other possessions. in that place he gave to Künd, father of Kurszán, land from the city of King Attila up to Százhalom3 and to Diósd, and to his son he gave a castle to protect his people. Then Kurszán ordered that the castle

47 THE lAND Of pANNONiA
On the twenty-first day, prince árpád, having taken counsel, marched off from Etzelburg to conquer the land of pannonia as far as the Drava River, and on the first day he encamped beside the Danube towards Százhalom. Then it was decided that the prince should send one part of his army along the Danube to the castle of Baranya, for which he appointed as the chief men and commanders two of the principal persons, namely Etu, father of Őd, and Vajta,2 from whom the Baracska kindred is descended, to whom for their most faithful service prince árpád gave no small gifts; and to Őd son of Etu, he gave land beside the Danube along with innumerable people. There Őd, having conquered the people of that region, built a castle that he called in the vernacular Szekcső, because he established for himself a seat and station.3 And to Vajta he gave in the same way a great land towards Sár with innumerable people, which is still called Vajta.

Then Ősbő and Őse, having arranged their army in battle line against the Roman warriors who guarded the castle of Veszprém, began to fight fiercely. And they fought with each other for a week. On the fourth day of the second week, when both armies were quite exhausted by the labor of war, Ősbő and Őse slew many warriors of the Romans at the point of the sword and killed others with arrow shots. The rest of the Romans, seeing the daring of the Hungarians, having quit the castle, fled Veszprém and, to save their lives, hurried to the land of the Germans, with Ősbő and Őse pursuing them as far as the confines of the Germans. One day, when the Hungarians and Romans were at the border, the Romans secretly swam across the river which is on the border between pannonia and the Germans, on account of which it is called lapincs by the Hungarians, because for fear of the Hungarians the Romans secretly swam across.1

1 A word-play is intended between árpád and the princess of Greek mythology, Harpalyce, a word taken from the Excidium Troie, where (27.12) Arpalice is glossed as “hoc est venatrice.” The reference is thus to árpád as a hunter.

Having heard this, prince árpád was happier than usual and returning again to Etzelburg made a great feast and gave great gifts to the messengers who had reported the glad news.
50 THE DESTRUCTiON Of pANNONiA
Then prince árpád and his noblemen leaving Etzelburg with a third of his army encamped beside the field of Sóskút and riding from there they arrived at Bodajk Mountain. On the eastern side, prince árpád gave to Előd, father of Szabolcs, a great wood that is now called Vértes on account of the shields of the Germans that were abandoned there.2 At the bottom of that wood, beside lake fertő, a long time later, Csák, nephew of Szabolcs, built a castle. what more? Thus proceeding, prince árpád and his warriors encamped beside St Martin’s mountain,3 and they and their beasts drank of the spring of Sabaria. Having ascended the mountain and seen the beauty of the land of pannonia, they became exceedingly happy. from there they marched to the Rába and Rábca [rivers], and laid waste the peoples and realms of the Slavs and pannonians and occupied their territories. They also stormed the boundaries of the Carinthians of the Mura4 with frequent assaults, of whom they killed many thousands at the point of the sword, threw down
2 Here the author explains a place-name from the Hungarian ‘vért’ meaning a shield or armour. The tradition that German soldiers had discarded their arms in that forest when fleeing in 1051 is recorded in the Hungarian Chronicle, see SRH 1, pp. 350–1.
3 The oldest Benedictine monastery of Hungary, pannonhalma (founded ca. 996), was connected to the legend of St Martin (of Tours), believed to have been born in that region. The spring called Sabaria belongs to the same legendary tradition. See wieczorek and Hinz, Europas Mitte, vol. 2, pp. 617–20, as in n. 2, p. 77 above.

Then Ősbő and Őse, father of Örkény, and their army returned safe and sound with a great victory to prince árpád. for God, whose mercy went before them, delivered into the hands of prince árpád and his warriors their enemies1 and, by His hands, they reaped the fruits of other peoples’ toils. when they were rooted and had conquered almost all the neighboring realms, they returned to the forest beside the Danube to hunt and, having sent their warriors home, the prince and his noblemen stayed there in that forest for ten days, and going from there, they descended to the city of King Attila and to Csepel island, where the princess and the other womenfolk of the noblemen were. That year, prince árpád begot a son, by the name of zolta,2 and great joy was made among the Hungarians, and for very many days the prince and his noblemen held great feasts, and their young men played games before the prince and his noblemen like the lambs of ewes before rams.3 Several days later, prince árpád and his noblemen sent by common counsel an army against Ménmarót, prince of Bihar, of which army Ősbő and Velek were appointed the chief men and commanders. They marched off from the island and rode through the sand, crossing the Tisza River at the ford of Bőd; and, riding on, they encamped beside the Kórógy River. All the Székely, who were previously the peoples of King Attila,4 having heard of Ősbő’s fame, came to make peace and, of their own will, gave their sons as hostages along with diverse gifts, and undertook to fight in the vanguard of Ősbő’s army against Ménmarót. They forthwith sent the sons of the Székely to prince árpád, and, with the Székely before them, began to ride together against Ménmarót. They crossed the Körös River at Szarvashalom and, riding from there, encamped beside the Tekerő River.

when Ménmarót heard that Ősbő and Velek, most noble warriors of prince árpád, had come against him with a strong force, with Székely in the vanguard, he feared more than was fitting and dared not go against them because he had heard that prince árpád and his warriors were stronger in war and that the Romans had been put to flight from pannonia by them; that they had laid waste the borders of the Carinthians of the Mura, and slain many thousands of men at the point of the sword; and that they had occupied the realm of the pannonians, and their enemies had fled before them. Then prince Ménmarót, having left a host of warriors in the castle of Biharia, fleeing before them, betook himself and his wife and daughter to the groves of igyfon. Ősbő and Velek and their entire army began happily to ride against the castle of Biharia and encamped beside the Jószás River. On the third day, having put their armies into battle lines, they marched out to attack the castle, and, in turn, warriors gathered from diverse nations began to fight against Ősbő and his warriors. The Székely and the Hungarians killed many men with arrow shots. Ősbő and Velek killed 125 warriors with crossbows. And they fought with each other for twelve days and, of Ősbő’s warriors, twenty Hungarians and fifteen Székely were killed. On the thirteenth day, when the Hungarians and Székely had filled in the castle’s moats, and sought to put ladders to the wall,1 the warriors of prince Ménmarót, seeing the boldness of the Hungarians, began to petition the two chief men of the army [for terms] and, having thrown the castle open, they came before Ősbő and Velek, beseeching them barefoot. putting a guard over them, Ősbő and Velek entered Biharia castle and found there the many treasures of the war

every day they ate as at a wedding with diverse warriors of the realms around, and their young men played games before the prince and his noblemen. prince árpád, having taken an oath of the leading men and warriors of Hungary, had his son, prince zolta, elevated [to the princely office] with great honor.1 Then the prince gave for his most faithful service to Ősbő, father of Szalók, the castle of Veszprém together with all its appurtenances and to Velek he gave the county of zaránd and he likewise gave to the other noblemen honors and villages. The following year after all this, Ménmarót died without a son and left his whole kingdom in peace to zolta, his son-in-law. After this, in the year of Our lord’s incarnation 907, árpád left this world and was buried with honor at the head of a small river that flows through a stone culvert to the city of King Attila where, after the conversion of the Hungarians, was built the church that is called fehéregyháza in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary.2

lay waste various realms, whose names were these: lél, son of Tas, Bulcsú, a bloodthirsty man,1 the son of Bogát, and Botond, the son of Kölpény. These were warlike men, brave in spirit, whose concern was none other than to conquer peoples for their lord and lay waste the realms of others. with leave of prince zolta, they fought with a Carinthian army and came through friuli to the march of Lombardy where they brutally sacked the city of padua with slaughter, fire, the sword and great plundering. Thence,2 entering lombardy, they did many evil things. When the inhabitants of the land, massed in a single army, sought to stand against their violence and monstrous fury, an innumerable host of the lombards were felled by the arrow shots of the Hungarians and many bishops and counts were butchered. Then, having heard this, Liutward, bishop of the church of Vercelli,3 a man of the greatest renown, most dear friend and most faithful privy counselor of Charles the lesser, the former emperor,4 taking with him his riches and matchless treasures which were more plentiful than may be reckoned, endeavoring in every way to escape their bloody savagery, came unwittingly upon the Hungarians and, being speedily captured by them, was killed, and the treasure that he brought that was beyond human reckoning seized. At the same time, Stephen, the brother of Count Waldo, while sitting at night on the privy above the wall of the castle to empty his bowels, was severely wounded by the arrow shot of a Hungarian through the chamber’s hatchway and died that night of the wound.5

5 The murder of Count waldo’s brother (Regino ad a. 901, p. 149) is mistakenly assigned to the Hungarians. Killing a person on the privy (easily accessible as outside the walls!) was seen by Gregory of Tours as a deserved punishment for certain heretics, being similar to the death of the heresiarch Arius—Hist. Franc. 3.7–8; see The History of the Franks, trans. l. Thorpe (london: penguin 1974); Cosmas of prague describes a similar case in respect of Duke Jaromir’s murder (1: 42, p. 79).

Then they laid waste lorraine and Germany, and they also put to ignominious flight the Eastern franks on the border of franconia and Bavaria, slaying many thousands of them by arrow shots, and, taking all their goods, they returned to prince zolta in Hungary.
55 THE DEATHS Of lél AND BUlCSú
five years later, during the reign of Emperor Conrad,1 lél, Bulcsú and Botond, the warriors of the late most glorious2 prince zolta of Hungary, having been dispatched by their lord, stormed the districts of Germany and took many of their goods. But, at last, by the despicable tricks of the Bavarians and Swabians, lél and Bulcsú were captured and killed, hanged from a gallows beside the inn River.3 Botond and the other warriors of the Hungarians, what was left of them, seeing themselves hemmed in by the guile of the foes, bravely and manfully stood ground. They did not separate from one another, but went especially to the aid of those still in danger, and like wounded lions they rushed into battle with roars against their foes and laid them low with the mightiest slaughter. Although they were defeated, they nevertheless beat the victors in courage and valor and laid them low with the mightiest slaughter. Happy now the Hungarian forces, safely through their dangerous courses, more warlike still from steady fight,4 excelling in both men

Those of them that escaped went homeward. But prince zolta and his chief men were not a little dismayed by the death of lél and Bulcsú and their other warriors, and they became enemies of the Germans. Then prince zolta and his warriors became inflamed against them because of the injury done to them by their foes, and did not hide that they intended to repay them for it however they could. But, with God’s grace, prince zolta, in the year of Our lord’s incarnation 931 begot a son, who was called Taksony, who had handsome, big eyes and soft, black hair like a lion’s mane,3 as you may hear in the following.

4 Anonymus’s chronology is shaky here. Otto i succeeded as king in 936 and faced almost immediately rebellions in Bavaria and Saxony. Otto’s brother, Henry, attempted to assassinate the king at Easter, 941. in 953, Otto’s son, liudolf of Swabia, and brother-in-law, Conrad of lotharingia, launched an uprising of their own, obtaining Hungarian aid. All of these events, however, predate the Hungarian defeats of 955 and the deaths of lél and Bulcsú.

with His scourge of wrath.1 Then these enemies of Otto, king of the Germans, sent their envoys to prince zolta, a warlike man, and having given him much gold, asked him whether they might attack the aforesaid King Otto with Hungarian support. prince zolta, led by wrath, as much on account of their request and reward 2 as on account of his mournful heart for the death of lél and Bulcsú, sent a great army against Otto, king of the Germans. He appointed as its chief men and commanders Botond, son of Kölpény, Szabolcs, son of Előd, and Örkény, son of Őse. Having departed from prince zolta, they put once more to the sword Bavaria, Swabia, Saxony and Thuringia and, marching from there, crossed the Rhine during Lent and destroyed the realm of lorraine with bows and arrows. Savagely casting down all Gaul, they remorselessly entered the churches of God and plundered them. Thence they forced their way by iron and the sword along the cliffs of Mont Cenis through the Alimin peoples.3 Having subdued these most warlike peoples, who were very well protected by natural locations, they crossed Mont Cenis and took the city of Susa. Then, marching on, they stormed the most wealthy city of Turin. After they had looked upon the plain of lombardy, they despoiled in swift moves almost all italy, which abounds and overflows with all treasures. Then Botond, son of Kölpény, and Örkény, son of Őse, having vanquished all the aforesaid peoples, returned to their own lands, delighting in happy victory. Then Otto, king of the Germans, set up an ambush along the Rhine and, attacking them with all the strength of his realm, killed many of them. Botond, Örkény and the rest of their forces, preferring to die in battle than to lose a victory due them, pressed

On the side of the Czechs, he set the border as far as the Morava River on condition that their duke paid an annual tribute to the prince of Hungary, and in the same way he put on the side of the poles the border at Tatry Mountain, just as Bors, son of Böngér, had done previously.

And from the land of Bular, there came some most noble lords with a great host of Muslims, whose names were Billa and Baks, to whom the prince granted lands in various parts of Hungary, and he gave in perpetuity, moreover, the castle that is called pest.2 Billa and his brother, Baks, from whom the line of Etej3 descends, having taken counsel, gave two parts of the people they had brought with them to the service of the aforesaid castle and they left the third part to their descendants.4 At the same time, there came from the same region a most noble warrior, Hetény by name, to whom the prince gave no small lands and other properties. prince Taksony begot a son, Géza by name, the fifth prince of Hungary.5 At that time, there came from the land of the pechenegs a warrior of ducal stock, whose name was Tonuzoba, father of Örkénd, from whom the Tomaj kindred descends, to whom prince Taksony gave a land to dwell in in the region of Kemej as far as the Tisza where is now the ford of Abád.

1 four rhymed clauses, translated with some poetic license.
2 Most students of the text argue that Anonymus did not mean this literally but rather as a metaphor: Christians live in eternity while pagans bury themselves “alive,” deprived of eternal life (cf. Rom. 6.3–11). interestingly, the contemporary Chroniques des comtes d’Anjou ends with very similar verses, including “nam vivere mundo, Mors est...”—ed. paul Marchegay and André Salmon, Soc. Hist. fr. 155 (paris: Renouard, 1865–71), 1: 363.The phrase itself ultimately derives from St Augustine, Epistolae, no 32 (Migne, PL, 33, col. 129). The issue is discussed in detail in János Bollók, “l’authenticité historique de la légende de Thonuzoba,” Annales Universitatis Scientiarum Budapestiensis de R. Eötvös nominatae. Linguistica 11 (1980), pp. 31–42.
3 The indication of a definite location of their burial (now Abádszalók) speaks, however, against the above metaphorical interpretation.












iNTRODUCTiON
The report of Master Roger on the Mongol invasion of Hungary is a rare text, being an eyewitness account of a major historical event in the thirteenth century. As such, it may be compared on the one hand with Galbert of Bruges’s twelfth-century narrative of the murder of Charles the Good, and, on the other, with Archdeacon Thomas of Split’s less immediate, but still contemporary account of the Mongol attack.1 Although written within a few years after the events of 1241–42, the text is extant only in a fifteenth-century printed edition. it is clear from the biography of the author (see below) that it was completed before 1244, but its fate over the following two and a half centuries remains unknown. The first edition was printed in 1488 in Brno as an appendix to the Hungarian Chronicle of John Thuróczi, royal notary and historian.2 Since the sponsor of that edition was in all likelihood John filipec, bishop of Várad/Oradea and diplomat and counselor of King Matthias i Corvinus, it is possible that filipec gave a manuscript to the printer (or to Thuróczi).3 At the time of the Mongol attack, Master Roger was archdeacon of Oradea; consequently, a copy of his narrative may have been pre

served in the Oradea cathedral, with which filipec kept in touch during his diplomatic missions. whatever the case, no manuscript has survived. But within just a few months of its publication, the editio princeps was re-edited in Augsburg, and then in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries several more printings appeared.4 in each instance, the editors added some “emendations” to the text, usually according to their taste in latin. its title, also emended several times, was probably the creation of a later copyist or the first editor. in the 1488 edition it runs (in translation): “Epistle of Master Roger to (or for) a pitiable (or Sorrowful) lament on the Destruction of Hungary by the Tatars written to Bishop John of pest.” Some editors or translators assumed the existence of a lost Carmen miserabile that would have been originally attached to the letter, but there are no evidence for such an assumption: although it was not formally composed in verse, the epistle itself is a “mournful song.” Moreover, in the title the identification of the bishop is erroneous. There was no bishopric in pest, and no John is known to have been a prelate in Hungary at the time of the text’s composition. Rather, the manuscript exemplar may have had (as was often the case) only the initials i and p. it is in fact clear from the biography of Roger that the reference was to Iacobus, bishop of Preneste, i.e., Giacomo di pecorari, bishop of palestrina. while the epistle is addressed to one person, it is most likely that Master Roger expected a wider circulation for his lament. in his detailed study of the Carmen miserabile (as Roger’s text traditionally came to be called), Tihamér Turchányi suggested a number of emendations to the text and pointed to passages that may be interpolations. Somewhat hypercritically, he also called into question the originality of the title, the chapter headings, and even the text’s division into chapters.5 ladislaus (lászló) Juhász, in his critical edition in the now standard collection of early medieval

Hungarian narratives, the SRH,6 utilized some of Turchányi’s comments. we follow essentially Juhász’s edition but amend obvious grammatical and orthographic errors. Master Roger is known to have been in the service of the Roman curia since the 1230s. He was born some time around 1205 in Torre Maggiore in Apulia.7 while his subsequent career is well documented, we know nothing about his youth. His title implies some higher education, but no record has been found on where he acquired his degree. from his epistle, one may suspect he had training not only in law (canon law?) but also in the arts (see below). As chaplain of the cardinal legate Giacomo di pecorari, he visited Hungary in 1232. The cardinal, who came to settle the conflict between King Andrew ii (1204–1235) and Archbishop Robert, stayed for two years in the country. Roger seems to have desired to remain there, and obtained the position first of chaplain and later of archdeacon of the bishopric of Oradea in eastern Hungary. while he appears to have accompanied his master on missions to italy and elsewhere (1236–1239), he was in Oradea when the Mongols attacked Hungary in 1241. Unlike the bishop, who fled west, Roger remained in the town, and sought refuge in the surrounding countryside. He eventually fell into the hands of the “Tatars,” from whom he escaped only during their retreat in 1242.8 Returning to Rome, he requested a new posting, as Oradea had been completely razed by the Mongols. He was then appointed archdeacon of the western Hungarian city of Sopron, where he arrived in 1243. it is most likely that he wrote his epistle to his former patron, Bishop James, while at Sopron, because the latter died a short time later on June 26, 1244. Thereafter, Roger ap

peared in the service of Cardinal John of Toledo, with whom he attended the council of lyon in 1245, already as canon of zagreb. franz Babinger suggested that Roger was influential in shaping papal policy towards the Mongols, who at that time became the subject of the papacy’s missionary and diplomatic plans.9 in 1249, Ugrin, archbishop of Split in Dalmatia, died, and pope innocent iV named Roger as Ugrin’s successor on April 30, 1249. The citizens and the cathedral chapter would have preferred the appointment of a Dominican monk, John, to the office and their sovereign, the king of Hungary, Béla iV, seems to have taken offence at not having been consulted by the papacy over Ugrin’s replacement. As a result, Roger only received Béla’s approval a year later, and arrived in Split with an impressive retinue in february, 1250. Thereafter, he administered the archdiocese with great energy and success—though not without some conflicts with both the city and the royal court. in his last years he was bedridden and paralyzed due to severe gout. He died on April 14, 1266 and was buried in the cathedral of St. Domnius.10 Roger’s reasons for writing his report—his causa scribendiwere to a great extent personal. By detailing his sufferings, he wanted to move his former patron and win his support in obtaining a new appointment after the destruction of his church in Hungary. But whether the cardinal was able to help him is unknown. Second, through Bishop James he may have wanted to present himself in Rome as an expert in Mongol matters, a subject much discussed in the papal curia at the time of his arrival. The topic was on the agenda of the Council of lyon, at which, as mentioned above, Roger was in attendance. while addressing the bishop several times in the epistle, Roger also counted on other readers, whom he wanted to “read and understand” the horrors and the lessons to

be learned. finally, in discussing the internal problems of Hungary, he took—though not uncritically—the side of the king, probably hoping to obtain his support for a new position in the kingdom. (in fact, Béla iV does not seem to have objected to Roger’s appointment, but only to the pope’s disregard of his royal opinion and authority in the process.) The epistle can be divided into two parts. The first fourteen chapters address the political situation in Hungary before the attack by the Mongols. Roger names five causes for the “enmity between the king and the Hungarians,” which, he argues, led to the failure of the resistance to the invasion. The following thirty-six chapters deal with the events of the years 1241–42, in good part (at least six long chapters) relating to the personal experiences of the author while in hiding, captivity, and flight. The political analysis of the epistle’s first part is a rare case in a medieval narrative. it was far more common for authors to assign the cause of a defeat or other calamity to the sins and faults of the victims. Thomas of Split, though not going into theological arguments, underlined the failings of Hungary’s youth, their spending time at “effeminate frivolities,” and other such wrongs.11 in a contemporary lament, an anonymous (monastic) author made explicit that God’s justice grants good to the good and avenges evil: thus, the wicked Hungarians had had to pay for their sins.12 Roger’s arguments, on the other hand, were strictly political and attempt to find palpable causes for the events. (As to divine punishment, at the very beginning of his preface he rather “accuses” the heavenly powers of having abandoned Hungary!) He lists the invitation and presence—nay, preferment—of the Cumans, brought to the country by King Béla in 1239, as the first and fifth causes of tension.

Second and fourth, the “Hungarians”—i.e., the nobles, among whom Roger may have had contacts—resented not only Béla’s revenge against his former opponents, adherents of his father, King Andrew, but also the strengthening of royal authority both by prohibiting the great men (barons) from sitting in his presence and by forcing them to submit pleas to the chancellery instead of to the king personally. The third cause was Béla’s review of earlier land grants and his attempt to restore the royal domain—deeds begrudged by those who lost property and prestige as a result. The “Cuman issue” is not an easy one. Roger does not (at least not explicitly) acknowledge that the king—for reasons other than his credible missionary zeal—might have been interested in receiving the Cuman warriors (and their retinue) in order to have a military force independent of the ever more powerful barons. The barons, however, may have been very well aware of this intention. Béla may also have realized that the archaic armed forces of the country, which were based on the service of a wide stratum of servitors and warriors attached to royal castles, were in need of reform, and that an additional host of light cavalry was necessary. in addition, the integration of newly arrived “pagans” posed a serious problem. while it is better documented during the second wave of Cuman immigration (after 1245),13 such integration must have been difficult from the very beginning. The appearance of a sizeable nomadic population certainly caused disruption in the sedentary life of villagers, and thus dissatisfaction among wide strata of society, including the peasantry. Roger’s location at the edge of the Hungarian plain, where the Cumans settled (or roamed), would have allowed him to receive immediate information about such conflicts, as well as about the suspicions of the nobles at court. Roger’s observations on the resentment of the leading men of the realm toward King Béla’s policies were well founded. The king’s revenge against the members of his father’s government is fully documented in the sources. At his coronation, not only were

the majority of high officials removed, but most of the kindreds and families whose members had served Andrew also vanished from the leading posts (some forever, others temporarily). Based on a detailed analysis of the charter evidence on the archontology of the age, Erik fügedi described these events as a “landslide” within the elite during the 1230s.14 The matter of royal donations and recuperations has a long history. in the beginning, due to internal struggles in the dynasty—starting with prince Emeric against his father Béla iii in the 1190s, and then the more serious conflicts between prince Andrew and his brother King Emeric—partisans of the winning side received sizeable properties as a reward for their support. Under Andrew ii, a conscious change of policy is documented. The king suggested in several charters that, in contrast to his predecessors, he intended to give away major pieces of land and their jurisdiction, including entire counties, to his “barons and knights.” Bálint Hóman saw in this a deliberate program that sought to move the foundations of royal income and power away from landed property to more “modern” sources of revenue, such as customs duties, coinage, and mining.15 To be sure, much was done to develop these resources, but clearly the project of Andrew and his counselors (who were probably led by Denis, son of Apod, the first victim of Béla’s revenge) was premature. The country’s economy had been for quite some time, and was still, primarily agrarian; monetary aspects were in the offing, but not yet prevalent by any means. King Andrew’s novae institutiones (as he called them) also aimed at supplying his leading men and their kindreds with resources that would allow them to equip themselves and their retinues with knightly armor and “catch up” on the military development of other European powers. The group of magnates that accompanied Andrew on his short-lived crusade in 1217 already represented such an up-to-date force. However, their defeat in

1241 at the hands of the swift Mongol horsemen with bow and arrow—like the defeat of western forces by the Magyars three hundred years earlier—had shown the disadvantages of such knightly armies vis-à-vis steppe nomadic enemies. The lesser freemen (called servientes regis, first mentioned in the late twelfth century) soon felt the repercussions, as they and the heads of the royal castle-districts (counties), the ispáns, lost out against the magnates. Andrew’s response is already apparent in the Golden Bull of 1222, prohibiting the donation of whole counties and limiting dual office-holding by the officers of the court.16 The king started to revise his earlier policies, but felt the need first to ask the pope to release him of his coronation oath, in which he (apparently) promised to keep his nobles’ rights untouched. The bull Intellecto, an important piece of canon law on the inalienability of royal property, was issued in this context.17 Andrew did not seriously pursue the recovery of royal lands and rights, but his son, prince and then King Béla iV did. There is ample charter evidence of this process, and it is clear that it caused tension between the ruler and the aristocracy. Similarly, King Béla’s attempts at regulating judicial procedure, changing it from previous kings’ personal administration of justice “sitting under the oak-tree” to impersonal written submissions, was an innovation at the expense of the freemen, who were accustomed to having immediate access to the ruler. Roger’s information on this new practice taking its toll on the poorer nobles is also convincing. in fact, in 1267, at the request of the lesser nobles, King Béla iV cancelled this measure,18 although it seems to have remained in effect for some time thereafter.

finally, the symbolic action of burning the chairs of the magnates in the royal council—where subsequently only the prelates and the princes (members of the dynasty?) were allowed to remain seated in the king’s presence—also points to the strengthening of royal authority. it has been suggested that Béla iV tried to return to the “authoritative” rule of his grandfather, the third Béla (1172–1196), whose power was admired by western visitors accustomed to the more “feudal” monarchies.19 Now, whether the kingdom of Hungary would have been able to resist or repel the attack of the expanding Mongol Empire without these serious internal problems is an open question. True, in their conquests the Mongols often profited from the lack of unified resistance—e.g., the Rus’ principalities or the divided China—but their superior organization and almost unlimited manpower still gave them an advantage over their eastern, southern, and western neighbors that was not easy to counter. Moreover, as mentioned above, the Hungarians “forgot” the tricks of steppenomadic warfare utilized successfully by their own forebears and fell easily into the Mongols’ traps. (On this, Roger has several examples.) However, King Béla was able to learn the lesson: in the years following the invasion, he reversed his policy of “recuperation” of royal lands and granted extensive properties to those barons who had the resources to build defendable stone castles. He also built a number of them himself, having seen that such structures had mostly withstood the Mongol attack of 1241.20 indeed, during subsequent (surely, less concentrated) Mongol forays in 1255 and later, the country suffered much less, and the enemy was repelled without great loss. Of course, the internal conditions of the Mongol Empire had much to do with the first invasion’s end in a sudden withdrawal and the Mongols’ marginal later incursions.

in early 1242, Batu returned to Central Asia after the death of his uncle, Great Khan Ögödei21; in the subsequent decades the empire fell apart, and the Golden Horde not only had to concentrate on their domination of the Rus’ principalities, but also faced internal succession troubles. The rest of Roger’s epistle is more or less a straightforward narrative of the events from the murder of the Cuman chief and subsequently his people’s leaving Hungary, to the first attacks of the Mongols and their burning and killing across Hungary, to their final withdrawal. Roger must have received reports from several locations that suffered Tatar attacks, and then experienced personally the fall of Oradea, the Mongols’ march across the southeastern parts of the country, and the devastation of villages and towns along their way. in addition to the knowledge gained from his own adventures, he was also informed (apparently by eyewitnesses) about the major battle at Muhi, the king’s escape to Austria and then to Dalmatia, and the Mongol incursions west of the Danube. in contrast to many authors of his age, Roger’s battle scenes are not borrowed from classical sources or other authorities. His detailed description of some of the encounters and of Mongol tactics used to gain the upper hand sounds very much like information told by veterans of the war and survivors of the sacked towns. Roger’s style reflects a good schooling in latin. As he was trained in the Roman curia, he was fully familiar with the rules of rhythmic prose and applied the cursus throughout his text. Actually, several assumptions in respect of inauthentic insertions can be shown to be wrong by checking his cursus. Moreover, when reporting a “false letter” (ch. 31, p. 193) he went out of his way not to write it in his usual rhythmic prose.22 A number of biblical cita

tions betray his clerical background, the few classical quotations his education. The structure of his political analysis, discussed above, suggests a legal (or scholastic) education: he formulated the “five issues of enmity” in a charge and rebuttal style, similar to plea and counterplea in court, but also to scholastic causa and responsio. At another point, Roger displays a more typically “scholastic” approach. while describing the many corpses left by the cruelty of the Mongols, he recounted their fate by referring to the four elements: earth, fire, water, and finally air.23 This passage is, in contrast to most of the text, not a down-to-earth description of his trials and tribulations, but a demonstration of his systematic way of thinking and writing. Yet, for the most part, Master Roger’s adjectives and adverbs aim at moving the emotions of his reader to compassion for himself and his fellow Christians on the one hand, and to condemnation of the inhumane cruelty of the pagan Mongols on the other. it is remarkable that Roger does not waste words on describing the Mongols in any detail. in contrast to, for example, Thomas of Split—to say nothing of the travelers into Mongol lands, such as friar Julian or John of plano Carpini—Roger wrote little about their way of life, mode of warfare, or mores, despite his having had first-hand knowledge of the Mongols of Batu Khan. Nor does he say much about the Cumans, important actors in the opening of his story. Of course, the genre—a “letter of lament”—prescribed his style and the choice of his subjects. The wildness, ruthlessness, and cruelty of the pagans are repeatedly underlined, as are the sufferings of the author, for that was the purpose of writing the text. Still, Roger’s (usually second-hand) reports on military encounters are plausible, as they fit well with the strategy and tactics of the Mongols recorded elsewhere, as do the actions of the Tatars, which he personally experienced. Somewhat surprisingly, at one point the author acknowledges the efficiency of Mongol adminis

tration of occupied Hungary, stating that their appointed officers guaranteed peace and justice—unless there is hidden irony in this sentence.24 in sum, Roger’s writing, including his details of horrific massacres and the heart-rending vicissitudes of runaways (such as himself ), has a uniquely “objective” tone. in a few cases—above all, those recounting the conflicts between the nobles and the kinghe expressly refrained from passing judgment, even if the apologies for Béla’s actions are clearly given greater emphasis in the text than the accusations against him. This is why historians not only tend to take Roger’s epistle at face value, but also characterize him as an “astute” observer, and praise him for his “italian rational, almost modern, thinking.”25 Discounting the few cases where his report was based on hearsay (for example, the names of the Mongol leaders, or the alleged invitation of Emperor frederick ii to the Hungarian throne26), Roger’s narrative indeed deserves to be accepted without much reservation. The present edition and translation follow the general principles of the CEMT series. As mentioned above, we follow our standard practice of printing the latest critical edition of the latin text without adding its full apparatus criticus of textual variants. Since no original, nor even a possible archetype, exists, the variants of the different editions have no authority, but at times the editors’ corrections may represent plausible emendations.27 The translation and annotations owe much to recent German and Hungarian translations (see the Bibliography).28 Terminological problems, often causing difficulties in translation, were not an issue, as Roger

27 The Augsburg print (A), in particular, has many superior spellings and readings (“longe emendatior”—ed.). As the date of this print is only three months later than the Editio princeps, it is possible that the printers had access to the Ms. Occasionally other early editions, such as Bongars’ (frankfurt, 1600, F) have interesting variants.

4 Clearly a copyist’s error, for Roger knew well that the Cumans arrived two years before the Mongols, in 1239 (see below, ch. 14, p. 159). The reasons for this mistake—probably due to misreading latin numbers—are discussed at length by the editor, ladislaus Juhász (SRH 2, p. 553, n. 2).
5 Kuten (Kuthen, Köten, Kötöny) was one of the major chiefs of the Cumans, mentioned in the sources after 1220; he participated in the internal struggles of Kievan Rus’, fought against the Mongols for a long time, and took part in the great battle at

2 HOw KiNG BélA iNTRODUCED THE KiNG Of THE CUMANS TO HUNGARY
in the year of the lord’s incarnation 1242,4 it happened that Kuten,5 king of the Cumans,6 sent solemn envoys to the said king with the message that he had fought the Tatars for many years and twice defeated them, but the third time, as he was unprepared, they suddenly broke into his land, and so—being unable to have an army—he was forced to turn his back to the cursed Tatars.7 They devastated most of his land by force and killed his people. There
the River Kalka on May 31, 1223, where the troops of Rus’ and the Cumans were defeated by the Mongols. Recently, an Oriental-type helmet was found in the Danube and was suggested to have belonged to Kuten or his retinue. for additional details on him, see now Szabolcs polgár, “Kötöny, kún fejedelm” [Kötöny, Cuman prince], in Tanulmányok a középkori magyar történelemről, ed. S. Homonnai, f. piti, and i. Tóth (Szeged: JATE, 1999), pp. 91–102.
6 The Cumans (Quipčak-Cumans, Russ.: polovci) were a Turkic people who in the eleventh-thirteenth century expanded their control from the River Volga and across the southern steppe all the way to the lower Danube. first mentioned in Rus’ sources in 1054, they fought both as enemies and allies of the Rus’ princes and also of Byzantium. They did not establish an empire of the Mongol type, but remained a more or less loose tribal alliance; see the summary in Berend, At the Gate, pp. 68–73, with literature.
7 Mongol attacks against the Cumans began around 1222. The decisive move was decreed at the kuriltay (meeting of leaders) in 1235; a major defeat of the Cuman prince Bačman on the lower Volga was followed by the complete subjection of the Cumans to Batu Khan’s Mongols by the end of 1238. Those unwilling to accept Mongol rule fled to the Crimea, Bulgaria and, under Kuten, to Hungary. Kuten’s claim to having defeated the Mongols cannot be substantiated.

2 There is no explicit evidence for Kuten’s or any other Cuman leader’s having been regarded as equal to the king of Hungary, rather an informal dependence seems to have been established when prince Béla became the godfather of the Cuman chief Barc and his retinue in 1227. in 1229, Béla had Cuman troops in his army and after 1235 inserted rex Cumanorum into his royal style. The significance of royal sponsorship of baptism has been extensively discussed (mainly for the early Middle Ages) by Arnold Angenendt, Kaiserherrschaft und Königstaufe. Kaiser, Könige und Päpste als geistliche Patrone in der abendländischen Missionsgeschichte (Berlin: De Gruyter, 1984).
3 Dominican missionaries were active in the region beyond the Carpathian Mountains (called ‘Cumania’) from the 1220s; see Nicolas pfeiffer, Die Ungarische Dominikanerprovinz von ihrer Gründung bis zur Tatarenwüstung 1241–42 (zürich: leemann, 1913). According to the Heiligenkreuz annalist, Béla received the Cumans on the suggestion of the Dominicans, against the counsel of his lords; see Continuatio Sancrucensis II, ed. Heinrich pertz, MGH SS 9 (Hanover: Hahn, 1851), p. 640.

fore, if he was willing to receive him and keep him in liberty, he was ready to submit himself and his people, come with his relatives, kinsmen and friends together with all their wealth and chattels to Hungary, and follow him in the Catholic faith. Hearing this, the king was filled with exceeding great joy,1 partly because a prince who hitherto was as equal to him2 was prepared to submit to his power and partly because he was thus able to fulfill his plan of winning so many souls for Jesus Christ. So he released the envoys, having honored them with substantial gifts, and sent his own envoys and Dominican friars3 to the said King Kuten, with the message that he was ready to receive him and his people and grant him all that he requested.4 what more? After several exchanges of envoys from both parties, the aforesaid Kuten set out with his people to come to Hungary. The king went to meet him at the border of his country with wondrous display of might,5 and granted him and his people such exceptional honors as the inhabitants of the land had neither done nor seen since times beyond memory.6 Then, as on account of their great number they could not comfortably stay at that place, he deputized one of his great men to lead

Generally in this context, see Erik fügedi, “Das mittelalterliche Ungarn als Gastland,” now in idem, Kings, Bishops, Nobles, and Burghers in Medieval Hungary (london: Variorum, 1986), ch. Viii.
5 The form and location (distance from the residence of the host) of the reception of a dignitary was a highly important symbolic gesture during the Middle Ages; see, e.g. Gerrit Jasper Schenk, Zeremoniell und Politik. Herrschereinzuge im spätmittelalterlichen Reich, forschungen zur Kaiser- und papstgeschichte des Mittelalter, 21 (Cologne &c: Böhlau, 2003). According to the (admittedly dated and fragmentary) royal itinerary of Károly Ráth, A magyar királyok és erdélyi fejedelmek hadjárati, utazásai és tartózkodási helyei [Campaigns, travels and residences of the kings of Hungary and princes of Transylvania] (Győr: Sauervein, 1866), p. 16, Béla iV was in Transylvania in february 1238 to meet Kuten, but no authentic charter issued by the king in the relevant years in that region is known.
6 There is no surviving record of the arrangements with the Cumans in 1239-41. Their legal status was defined after their return in the later 1240s; see Berend, At the Gate, pp. 85–95.

1 Although this is the only figure mentioned about the number of Cumans, Roger’s—vague, as he admits himself—information seems to be an overstatement and was probably used to indicate a very large multitude (the numbers 40 or 80 thousand were widely used by Antique authors for barbarian hordes; see, e.g., Berend, At the Gate, p. 71, n. 114).

3 HERE fOllOwS ABOUT THE ENMiTY BETwEEN THE KiNG AND THE HUNGARiANS; AND, TO BEGiN wiTH, THE fiRST REASON fOR THE ENMiTY
when the king of the Cumans with his nobles and commoners2 began to roam around Hungary, they caused severe damage to the pastures, crops, gardens, orchards, copses, vineyards and other goods of the Hungarians, as they had an enormous amount of cattle. And what was even more horrible, they—for they were wild people—inhumanly raped the virgins of the poor and defiled the bed of the powerful, whenever they had a chance. True, their women were bedded by the Hungarians as if they were worthless. Should a Hungarian offend a Cuman, either in his person or goods, justice was rendered to the Cuman right away, so that no one would dare to commit anything similar. But should a Cuman harm a Hungarian, the Hungarian was not rendered justice, and if he dared to pursue the matter, he might get lashes for his words. Thus enmity emerged between the people and the king.
cannot be adduced for 1239, as we do not know how many of the original refugees later returned.
2 Both written and archaeological evidence (burial sites) suggest the existence of a higher stratum among the Cumans (princes, heads of kindreds and major families) with a sizeable common free population and a great number of slaves, mainly captives.

King Béla was crowned by Archbishop Robert on October 14, 1235.

Even if i detour a little, i do it, so they that read may understand1 and those who hear it, comprehend the basic reason for the destruction of Hungary; i will quickly return to continue with the matter at hand. when the father of this King Béla, King Andrew of blessed memory,2 paid his debt to death, the king went immediately to the city of Székesfehérvár with the princes and nobles of the realm, and once the archbishop of Esztergom had crowned him with the royal crown—as is the custom3—he exiled some of those barons4 who had stood against him on his father’s side; others, whom he could, he put in jail.5 One of the major dignitaries, palatine Denis,6 was deprived of his eyes. At the same place, he issued certain decrees and ordered it to be announced that the land had to be cleansed of evil men, of whom there were a great many. in order to repress the bold temerity of the barons, he commanded that if any of the barons—except his princes,7 archbishops and bishops—should dare to sit in his presence, he would be punished by due penalty. At the same time, he had the chairs of the barons burned, insofar as he could find them.8 The relatives of the exiles and the friends of the incarcerated took this badly, fearing for their own future. Hence a stumbling block arose between them.
ated, later dying in prison. King Béla is supposed to have meted out punishments especially to those who were suspected of having had a part in the murder of his mother, Gertrudis (1213), but who had remained in his father’s service even thereafter.
6 Denis son of Apod/Ampod, was a close supporter of King Andrew and count palatine 1227–9 and 1231–4.
7 The term principes may stand here either for members of the royal family or for the great men of the realm.
8 in the mid-twelfth century, Otto of freising wrote of the Hungarian leaders (primores) that “they come together at the court of their king, each of them bringing his chair (sella) with him to discuss matters of state.” (The Deeds of Frederick Barbarossa, pp. 66–7). True, he went on to speak of the undisputed power of the king, but the “private chairs” are mentioned rather in the context of the Hungarians’ primitive housing conditions, and thus without any “political” implication. At any rate, it appears that by the time of Béla iV the practice of the barons to sit in the royal presence was perceived as too “egalitarian.”

5 THE THiRD REASON Of ENMiTY fOllOwED fROM THiS.
Then, the nobles recounted with bitter heart that in the past, when they or their ancestors were sent oftentimes by the kings to campaigns against the Russians, Cumans, poles and others, and some perished by the sword, some died of hunger, some were thrown in jail, and others subjected to various tortures, the kings who lived then granted those who returned, or the relatives of those captured, villages, estates and properties in perpetuity as suitable reward and recompense.1 This one, however, not only failed to give them anything, but revoked into his own right and property estates already granted, without legal judgment.2 This is the pain, this is the sword that pierced the hearts of the Hungarians.3 Those, namely, who were rich and powerful and had an importunate entourage, could barely maintain even themselves.
6 THE fOURTH REASON Of ENMiTY BETwEEN KiNG BélA AND THE HUNGARiANS
They often complained that the king ordered of his own will, in contrast to the custom of the realm and to their disadvantage, that nobles, however high ranking, could not open their suits in his court and speak to him personally, but had to submit petitions to the chancellors and expect judgment in their cases from them.4 Be
4 Even though the Hungarian chronicle tradition (see, e.g., Simon of Kéza, pp. 1445) credited the introduction of written petitions on the papal and imperial model to King Béla iii (1172–96), Roger’s information is more credible and fits larger European patterns; see György Györffy, “A magyar krónikák adata a iii. Béla-kori petícióról” [The evidence of the chronicles about petitions under King Béla iii], in Középkori kútfőink kritikus kérdései [Critical issues regarding our medieval sources], ed. János Horváth and György Székely (Budapest: Akadémiai, 1967), pp. 333–8. Györffy, ibid., p.337 demonstrated that the practice did not stop with its formal abrogation in 1267. The earliest authentic mention of a royal chancellor is from 1186. Roger’s plural may include the vice-chancellor (documented since 1209 as another officer of the court).

cause of this, many of them were forced to stay so long at court for the pettiest case that they had to sell their horses and other chattels to cover their expenses, and then often left without their case being settled. They maintained that the chancellors cast down some and raised up others at their whim, since they could not talk to the king without asking them. Thus it was generally and openly asserted that these were their kings and they said that they had no other king.
7 THE ORiGiN Of THE fifTH CAUSE Of ENMiTY
They also spoke of another matter, namely that the Cumans were brought in without, or rather against, their counsel to oppress and confound them. This was evident from the fact that when they came, invited or otherwise, to the king’s court, they had no chance to see the king, but could speak to him only at a distance, through intermediaries, but when the least of the Cumans went there, the door was open to him right away to enter, and the king gave precedence to the Cumans over the Hungarians in meetings, in council, and in everything else. Because of this, there was such a great indignation in them that they could scarcely bear it and, even though they did not express it, their hearts and minds were not favorable to him and they did not consider counsels of peace towards him.
8 RESpONSE TO THE fiRST REASON Of ENMiTY
The king’s supporters and those favoring the king, who tried to justify him in every respect, responded to these as follows. After the arrival of the Cumans, when the king was informed by trustworthy men that the Hungarians suffered injuries because of the Cumans, the king called his dignitaries, barons, ispáns,1 and all the Cumans together to the monastery of Kő near the River Tisza.2 There, with wise counsel and by common decision, they sanctioned that the

1 prince Béla governed 1220–6 Slavonia and 1226–35 Transylvania, where he had his own court. Conflicts between father and son originated mainly in Béla’s insistence on restoring the royal domain, while Andrew, in spite of promises to do so, frequently returned to his earlier “magnanimity” (alias, profligacy). Actually, Béla was crowned king by his father in 1214 in response to an attempt by some lords to raise him to the throne against his father after the assassination of Queen Gertrudis in 1213.

Cuman nobles, together with their retinues, should be distributed among the various provinces of Hungary and should stay in that province assigned to them; thus, not being many in one group, they would cause no harm to the Hungarians. Should a Cuman injure a Hungarian or a Hungarian a Cuman, the ispáns should administer equal justice as they were enjoined, under the penalty of losing the king’s favor. The Cumans [accepted this, although they] did not at all like to be separated from each other. So thereafter they roamed the uninhabited parts of Hungary with their felt tents, herds and flocks. And since many of them were poor, the Hungarians could get servants almost for nothing from their midst. Thus, the condition of the Cumans was more an advantage than a disadvantage to them. Hence the ill will of the people should have ceased.
9 RESpONSE TO THE SECOND REASON Of ENMiTY
Nobody with a sane mind should be surprised that the king, after his father’s death, when he took over the governance of the realm, had some of the great men subjected to investigation and torture, since these had frequently caused sedition and scandal between this king and his father, so that—gathering armies on both sides—they were often close to fighting each other had not those in the middle arranged peace between them. it cannot be denied that, whenever the king went to the court of his father, they did not honor him at all but attempted to dishonor him by word and deed as much as possible.1 Then they conspired maliciously against the life of the father and his sons2 in the hope that by killing them by the sword they could easily acquire their share of Hungarywhich they had divided among themselves—without anyone else imposing conditions. And, when they could not fulfill their plan, they devised something even worse. They sent a letter with specific

After King Andrew’s death, his last wife bore a fourth son, Stephen (1236–72), father of the later King Andrew iii.

That he left these traitors alive was an act of mercy, which makes the judgment most praiseworthy. He ordered that the land be cleansed of evil men, but is that unfair? He burned the baron’s chairs, but what kind of unfairness was that? Should lords and subjects be equal? Thus, the Hungarians were not just in their claim.
10 RESpONSE TO THE THiRD REASON Of ENMiTY
Regarding the third cause of enmity, they excused the king thus. Everyone knows that Hungary has seventy-two counties. The kings of Hungary granted these to meritorious persons and they could be revoked without offending those who held them. Their luxury, wealth and income, power, rank and security came from these counties. However, because of the profligacy of some of his predecessors, their rights over the counties had been diminished to a great extent, since they had granted in perpetuity properties, villages, and estates belonging to the counties to deserving and undeserving persons alike.3 Therefore, because of the diminution of the counties the ispáns had no men, and when they marched out, they were taken for simple knights. Those, however, who were more powerful, such as the master of the treasurers, also called the chamberlain, the masters of the table, of the butlers, of the horse, and other officers of the court became so fattened that they disregarded the kings.4 This one,5 however, as he wished to restore the power
4 These officers became regular dignities of the court in the early thirteenth century. The master of the treasurers was initially in charge of the supplies of the court, but with time became ever more engaged in the administration of justice so that he gradually lost all economic functions. The other masters were also major dignitaries (barons), clearly established on the model of other royal courts; it is not known whether they still performed specific duties at the table or in the stables. 5 i.e., Béla iV.

Although he did not do anything unlawful and always acted within his right, yet he granted appropriate rewards from the royal possessions to those who served him well and faithfully;1 so, because he acted according to his right, the malice of the Hungarians should have ceased.
11 RESpONSE TO THE fOURTH REASON Of ENMiTY
Because of the many differences and various practices, the entire Hungary was deformed and the king wished to reform matters by all means. Thus, unable to offer benevolent audience to every person, he decided after mature deliberation to have the affairs of the inhabitants of the realm handled through petitions in his court, following the example of the Roman Curia. He instructed his chancellors to settle simple and minor matters by themselves, as fast as possible, and present to him for deliberation only the important and difficult cases. He did so in order to have cases quickly and properly settled. But evil-minded people turned to evil what was invented for the good of the oppressed and mendaciously tried to find a knot on a rush and a hair in an egg.2
1 The contradiction implied in the latin leaves the sense unclear.
2 These expressions seems to be proverbial, although in the first instance stupa is not quite the right word, meaning the straw of flax; in Classical latin (e.g., Terence) we find ... nodum in scirpo (‘... on a rush’). The second one is unusual, occuring only in two papal letters (Clement iV to King louis iX of france, 8 May 1265, and Clement V to King philip of france, 18 Oct. 1309) and mentioned as “commonly said” in an eighteenth-century book, ignatius Hyacinthus Amat De Graveson’s Historia ecclesiastica, ed.

12 RESpONSE TO THE fifTH REASON Of ENMiTY
Their allegation that the king brought in the Cumans to oppress the Hungarians and out of hatred for them is entirely false. He did so purely in order that devotion to the name of God might increase in Hungary in his time and so, if it should happen that he had to wage war against the enemies of the crown,1 he would be able to fight with greater force and more vigorously with their help. And if he kept the Cumans in greater honor than the Hungarians, they could and should not have taken that badly. for it is appropriate to the royal dignity to honor guests,2 particularly as he had promised this to them by oath, for they were to follow him in faith. Because the Hungarians hated them, only the king was their protector in Hungary. Kuten, the king of the Cumans, was baptized by the king and many others by the great men and the nobles of the realm, so that they entered marriages with Hungarians. Had the king not favored them, they would not have stayed in Hungary. Having listened to what the one side and the other said, the author reserves judgment; the reader may, if able, decide with the help of justice.

14 THE COMMON OpiNiON Of THE HUNGARiANS
After the passing of one year of the lord, when Hungary was so malignant towards the king, around the feast of the birth of the lord,1 news came that the Tatars were devastating the confines of Hungary adjacent to Rus’.2 when this was confirmed to the king by messengers, he sent his chief ispán, the palatine,3 with an army to guard the Russian Gate—called the Mountain Gate4—through which the road leads to Hungary, and announced in the whole country that both the nobles and those called servientes regis as well as the castle warriors attached to the aforementioned castles,5 should prepare for war and be ready when the king sent for them. when this was announced all across Hungary, the Hungarians, amidst their exceeding hilarities6 did not believe it and maintained that they had often heard such things about the Tatars and always found out that they meant nothing. They said that “Many things are reborn that have fallen before.”7 Others asserted that these rumors were spread by some prelates of churches so that they need not go to Rome to the synod called at that time by the Roman pope.8 That was their opinion. However, it was well known to all that Archbishop Ugolin of Kalocsa9 had ordered galleys in Venice for himself and some of his bishops, but the king called them back from the journey, against their will. So that they had a good excuse to disparage the king, quite a few others said that the Cumans had
attached to the royal castles (iobagiones castri, castrenses) and served under the ispáns or the castellans. The servientes regis and a good part of the castle warriors merged later into what became the “common nobility,” see Rady, Nobility, pp. 35–44.

made friends with the Tatars1 to fight together against the Hungarians who had done them much wrong and had quite often destroyed them, that Kuten and his men had preceded them by more than a year in order to explore the conditions of the country and learn its language, and that as soon as he heard of their invasion, he would begin war against the king. Thus, they would be able the more easily to capture the gate, hasten to aid Kuten, and devastate some part of Hungary. with this, they happily carped at the king for having brought in the Cumans, as we told before. And many agreed with this opinion.
15 THE KiNG’S COUNCil AGAiNST THE TATARS
Then, when towards lent2 he was on his way and this kind of rumor was spreading ever farther, the king hurried towards a village called Buda on the Danube,3 where he usually spent lent, as this place was held to be more easily accessible.4 Having called together the archbishops, bishops, and the other great men of the realm, he untiringly consulted how to act in this important matter. He repeatedly warned and encouraged them to keep their paid soldiers ready. Then, after common and considered decision of the court, he placed Kuten with his wife, sons, daughters and a few of his chief men, whom he had summoned as suspects and accessories to the crime, under guard lest they escape from their hands.

About the middle of lent one of the palatine’s men arrived post haste to the king and reported in the name of the count palatine that [the Tatars] had reached the Russian Gate and were destroying the border obstacles,1 and they were afraid that the palatine would not be able to withstand them unless the king sent help fast. The king, still incredulous, did not have armed warriors with him. while he was tarrying there amidst such anxieties, on the fourth day, the palatine himself arrived, having ridden night and day, and reported that in early March, on the twelfth, he had engaged them at the Gate. Almost all his men were cruelly killed by arrows and swords; he had escaped with a few and come to report what had happened. But the king, although quite astounded by the bad news, released his archbishops, bishops and others, his ispáns and barons, firmly and strictly ordering them to gather their troops and return to him as soon as possible, not losing time as urgent necessity and evident need demanded. He charged Master Stephen, bishop of Vác,2 and the provosts of Arad3 and of the church of the Holy Savior in Cenad,4 to hurry to the queen5 and hasten with her to the Austrian border and wait there until this matter was over. He also wrote to the duke of Austria asking him to come quickly, and he commanded all the Cumans to join him without delay. Then he, with troops called up from the cities of Esztergom and Székesfehérvár (which were only one day distant), right away crossed the Danube and made a halt in the great and rich German village of pest,6 across from Buda on the other side of the Danube, waiting there for his great men, ispáns, and barons with their troops.

6 Göckenjan (Mongolensturrm, p. 202, n. 92) has sought to identify Coacton with Güyüg, later Great Khan, who set out with Batu for the west but was called back to march against Karakorum. 7 Seiban was the youngest brother of Batu.
8 perhaps a misspelling of Bajdar, commander of the detachment that attacked poland and Moravia and joined the troops of Batu later (see below, ch. 20). 9 The name Hermeus cannot be connected to any known Mongol leader.
10 Göckenjan (p. 202, n. 96) reads this name as that of Jebe (“weapon”), the famous commander and retainer of Chinggis, who, however, is not otherwise known to have been on the western campaign.
11 Ocadar is hypothetically identified with Great Khan Ögedei (ibid., n. 97), who, of course, did not take part in the campaign.

1 The size of the Mongol army seems to be seriously overstated. According to different sources (see ibid., n. 98, pp. 202-3) Batu set out to the west with only two of the five major armies of the Mongols and thus may have had some fifty thousand man under his command. Other estimates go up as far as 100,000.
2 while the Cumans lived in a wide area between the River iltis and the lower Danube, Hungarian sources (apparently known to Roger) use the term Cumania to refer to the area more or less identical with what came to be the territory of the later Romanian principalities.
3 in fact, news had already reached Hungary of the move of the Mongols westward around 1237 through the report of the Dominican friar Julian, who had to give up his second attempt at finding the relatives of the Magyars near the Ural Mountains (Magna Hungaria) because of the advance of the Tatars. He alerted the Hungarian court in his “Epistula de vita Tartarorum,” 4–5 (Dörrie, ed., Drei Texte, pp. 177–81). There are also some other references to Mongol envoys sent to King Béla, threatening him with war, inter alia for having received the Cuman refugees (ibid., pp. 179), and

20 HOw THE TATARS DESTROYED RUS’ AND CUMANiA2
So, having entirely and single-mindedly destroyed Rus’ and Cumania, they retreated to the distance of four to five days, leaving untouched the borderlands adjacent to Hungary, so that when they returned they would be able to find food and fodder for themselves and their horses and so that no news might reach the Hungarians about them.3 Once they had exhausted the victuals of the said countries and decided to occupy Hungary, Batu, their leading chief, hastened, having dismissed his retinue, with a few of his warriors straight to the said Russian Gate, which was nearest to the place where the king was assembling his army.4 After having defeated the troops of the count palatine, he took this gate and passed through it. King peta5 directed his steps towards poland and, having killed one of the dukes of poland6 he destroyed the noblest city of wrocław in a horrible bloodbath; then he crossed with similar cruelty the land of the duke of Moravia—while no other dukes came to his aid—and hastened to the gate of Hungary.7 King Qadan arrived after three days’ march through the forests between

4 The reference to “the king” is ambiguous. King Béla’s army was at that point not assembling anywhere, while Batu’s seems to have been stationed somewhere in Rus’.
5 The commanders of the Mongol troops that attacked poland were in fact Orda, Kajdu and Bajdar.
6 Duke Henry ii of Silesia fell in the battle of legnica/liegnitz on April 9, 1241, where the polish forces were routed by the Mongols.
7 The Mongols took Cracow on 24 March, attacked wrocław (which had been deserted by its inhabitants, hence no “great bloodbath” followed) on 2 April and, after the victory at legnica, moved via Henrików and Otmuchów to Moravia. King wenceslas i (1230-53) arrived too late to challenge them, so they wasted the duchy and entered Hungary across the white Carpathians towards Trenčín.

1 Rodna (Hungarian: Radna) was the most important early center of silver mining in northern Transylvania. its inhabitants were mostly ‘Saxon’ miners, hence its description as a “German city.”
2 while the expression furor Theutonicus goes back to lucan (Phars., 1, 255), it reemerged much closer to our author’s time during the italian wars of Barbarossa. See wolfgang Giese and Rex Ruffe, “furoris Teutonici decor!

Rus’ and Cumania to Rodna, the rich village of the Germans1 built among the high mountains. it was the king’s silver mine, filled with people of immense number. But, since these were warlike men and not short of weapons, when they heard of their arrival, they went out across the mountains and forests to meet them outside the town. Qadan, seeing the multitude of armed men, turned his back and feigned retreat. The people, returning victoriously, put aside their arms and, as moved by the furor of the Teutons, began to be inebriated by wine.2 Then the Tatars suddenly returned and entered the city from all sides, for it had no moat, no walls, and no other fortifications. Although there was great slaughter on both sides, when the people saw that they could not resist, they gave themselves up altogether to their mercy. Qadan took the city under his protection, attached Aristald, the ispán of the town,3 along with six hundred selected German soldiers, to his army and started out with them across the forest.4 Meanwhile Bogutai,5 together with other kings, crossed the river called Seret, reached the land of the bishop of the Cumans,6 defeated the men assembled there for battle and seized the entire land. let us now return to the king of Hungary in the said city of pest, to describe his progress in detail.
3 Rodna was exempt from the authority of the county’s ispán and had its own comes. A Herystoldus, “former ispán of Radna,” is mentioned in a charter of King Béla iV from 1243 (see Györffy, Geographia, 1, pp. 553–62).
4 The forest refers to the forested mountains separating Hungary from Transylvania (lit. “Beyond the forest”); thus Qadan moved west towards Hungary proper.
5 Other sources identify the leaders of this army of the Mongols, besides Bogutai, as Sübötej and Böyek. There may have been two detachments of the “southern wing.”
6 The bishopric of the Cumans (with its see at Milko, founded in the 1220s) covered the area between the rivers Seret and Olt, sometimes including also Braşov and its area. its first bishop was Theodor, head of the Hungarian Dominican province.

21 HOw THE TATARS pROCEEDED AfTER CApTURiNG THE GATE
Batu, the major lord, having captured the Gate, began to burn down villages, and his sword did not pardon sex or age, and he hastened as fast as he could against the king. when he reached a place half a day’s distance from pest on the friday preceding the Sunday of the lord’s passion,1 he sent out men to burn and kill as their inborn viciousness dictated. On the next day, he sent others or the same and they committed similar or worse deeds. But the king did not allow anyone to go out and engage them. when they were expected to withdraw, they returned and, when they were thought to be withdrawing, they came back again; the whole day was spent playing thus. when they did the same on Sunday, Archbishop Ugolin of Kalocsa took it badly that they should, like robbers, dishonor so many good people, but bore it even worse that both to him and his men the king seemed to be fainthearted. Therefore, he went out, against the king’s order, with a few men and wanted to have battle with them. But they turned their backs and began slowly to retreat. Seeing this, the archbishop spurred on his horse and gave them chase. Eventually, they reached a marshland and they crossed it swiftly. The archbishop did not notice this when he was quite close to them and hastily entered it. Being weighed down by their armor, he and his men could neither cross nor return. But the Tatars turned around quickly, surrounded the marsh and killed them all with a shower of arrows. The archbishop escaped with three or four men and returned embarrassed to the city, quite irate because of the loss of his men and that the king did not send any help to them.
1 March 15, 1241. Thus the advance detachment—surely not the entire army—that arrived near pest, apparently to harass the gathering royal army, covered a distance of 300 km in three days, an impressive achievement though not unknown of Mongol horsemen.

On passion Sunday,2 a part of the army of the king of kings, Batu, reached the city of Vác, which is along the Danube, half a day’s distance from pest, where the king was staying with his army. Once they had completely occupied and defeated the city, an innumerable crowd of people vigorously stormed the church and the palace of the church, which were fortified like a castle, where people from the town and the surrounding villages had taken refuge. Then, after having seized the treasury of the church, they completely burned in the fire all those whorm they did not wish to kill by the sword: all the canons and other persons, ladies, and girls. Thus on the day of passion, those of Vác suffered their passion so as to be worthy to have part with the Lord Christ.3

to the aid of the fallen men, the duke speedily grabbed the sword that hung on his saddle in a warlike way and with one blow cut off his arm. Toppling at once out of the saddle, the man gave up his soul. Since the rest took flight, they captured the fallen man, bound him and took him back to the army, together with the horses. The Hungarians used the occasion to unanimously disparage the king and praise the duke.
24 HOw KUTEN, THE KiNG Of THE CUMANS, wAS KillED
And because it was commonly held that Kuten, who, as we said, was kept under guard near the king, was not innocent in these great crimes, and because it was thought that those who now attacked were Cumans and not Tatars,1 all the people clamored against him: “He has to die! He has to die! He is the one who bought about the destruction of Hungary!” They also accused the king, saying: “The king should fight; he brought in the Cumans out of hatred for us.” Others shouted “The king should go to war with those to whom he granted our properties!” The king, who often heard these reproaches, sent a man to Kuten that he should immediately come to him. But Kuten, who also heard the repeated clamor of the people, was, although innocent, still afraid of punishment and replied to the king that he could not go to him unless he sent such a person for him who had the power to conduct him there and keep him from the hands of the people. when the messenger told this to the king there was great uproar among the people: “He has to die! He has to die!” Suddenly, armed Hungarians and Germans broke into the palace where he was staying and wanted to reach him by force. Kuten and those with him, however, took up bows and arrows and did not allow them to seize them. But when a throng of people rushed there, they were captured, and their heads immediately cut off and thrown out of the windows of the palace into the crowd. Some are inclined to assign this crime to the duke of Austria,1 others say that it was done on the king’s

Because the Tatars were day and night burning down villages all around, the archbishop of Kalocsa urged the king to march out against them in force. Thus, after the departure of the duke of Austria and especially when the majority of the country’s army had arrived, the king moved out with his army and marched slowly against them. when the Cumans, called to arms from everywhere against the Tatars all arrived and heard of the death of their lord, Kuten, they were very much troubled and agitated,3 not knowing what to do. when the news of his death had spread, the Hungarian peasants, who hated them, rose against them, and pillaged and killed them mercilessly. They in turn, realizing that they might perish, came together and not only defended themselves but also burned down villages and vigorously defeated the peasants.

3 Marchia meant the region between the rivers Danube and Sava, otherwise called Srem (Sirmium; Hung. Szerémség). in earlier time, there may have been a border county (marchia, ‘march’), hence the name.
4 Both of these (in Hung.: Nagyolaszi and Szentmárton) were settlements of “latin” hospites; the former, characterized as “having a senate,” may have enjoyed certain liberties typical for market towns of foreign settlers.

26 HOw THE BiSHOp Of CENAD ESCApED fROM THE HANDS Of THE CUMANS
However, when Bishop Bulcsú of Cenad1 and Nicholas son of Barc,2 together with many noblemen, tried to move their wives, sons, daughters and servants to upper Hungary and then quickly join the king’s army, they were confronted by Cumans and fought very hard with them. Unable to resist them, almost all perished by the sword. while the fighting was going on, the bishop, lying sick in a carriage, was taken away with a few companions. The Cumans then wasted the land just like the Tatars; they assembled and crossed the Danube from this side and hastened, thus wasting, towards the March.3 when the men of the March heard this, they assembled, went to meet them and engaged them at the border of the March. But they were defeated and vied with each other in flight. Thus the Cumans wickedly occupied the March, cruelly avenging the death of their lord. when they were killing Hungarians, they said “Take this blow for Kuten!” Then, having destroyed some more notable villages, such as the market town of Manđelos, [the village of ] Martinci4 and others, they took much money, horses and cattle, and left for Bulgaria, wasting the land.5
5 As mentioned above (see n. 7, p. 137), Cumans had settled in the Balkans some time earlier, so those fleeing Hungary were met by fellow countrymen who played important roles in the development of the Bulgarian and wallachian states. However, King Béla iV recalled them in 1245 and many of them (though it is unknown what part) returned, so that a sizeable Cuman population came to settle in the Hungarian plain; see Berend, At the Gate, pp. 68–73, 87–93, 97–100, etc. (see index, p. 336).

27 HOw THE BiSHOp Of ORADEA wAS TRiCKED BY THE TATARS
Bishop Benedict of Oradea1 collected a sizeable army on the king’s command and was about to march to his aid when he heard that the Tatars had destroyed the city of Eger and looted the treasures of the bishop2 and the church, having killed the citizens and others who came to their aid, by fire and sword. Encouraged by the fact that he had a few days before attacked and defeated a minor group of them, he dismissed the troops and pursued the Tatars in order to recover bits of it lest they be lost. The Tatars, foreseeing that, feigned retreat and halted. Because they had many horses but not enough men,3 they devised and arranged this: they made puppets and many monstrous figures which they sat on the riderless horses as if they were warriors; then they lined up the horses at the foot of a hillock with some servants. They ordered that when they engaged the Hungarians in battle, the servants should lead the horses in battle line marching slowly towards them. They waited on the plain for the Hungarians. when these arrived, ispán Both4 and a few others, regarded as some of Hungary’s better warriors, who were in the bishop’s retinue, dropping the reins of their horses fought with them a tough battle. Since the Tatars were fewer in numbers, they feigned retreat and began to move towards the hillock. Then, when the ghost riders appeared from below the hill in battle line, as planned, the Hungarians thought that they had fallen into a trap, turned around and ran away fast. The Tatars now turned around, pursued them, struck them down and slew them, committing as much cruelty as possible. The bishop, how

1 Roger’s account of the bishop’s escape is somewhat simplified: from Oradea the bishop and his men must have crossed the Tisza River first and then the Danube. However, Bishop Benedict is not listed by name among the dignitaries who were with the king in Dalmatia; see Thomas of Split, pp. 293–4.

28 THE ill fATED BATTlE Of KiNG BélA wiTH THE TATARS
when the king marched out from the city of pest, as mentioned, and moved with a great number of armed men against the Tatars, they stopped burning villages, quickly assembled, and retreated by the way they had come. As much as they were little by little pursued, so they pretended to retreat. when the Hungarians reached a certain river called Sajó (not far from the city of Eger, running into the Tisza River) they crossed the river on a bridge, halted and encamped.2 They placed guards on the bridge and kept night watch. The Tatars, after crossing the same marsh encamped on the plain next to the river. it seemed unlikely that anyone could cross except by the bridge, for the river was wide and muddy. Meanwhile the king encouraged his men to prepare manfully for battle and personally handed out many flags3 among the great men. The Hungarians, trusting their number, made fun of all this and—owing to the matters discussed above—had neither mind nor spirit for fighting. They would have liked the king to be defeated so that they would then be dearer to him. They thought that any such calamity would only hit some in particular and not all in general as they had heard that such things had happened before in Hungary. for the Cumans used to attack swiftly and devastate a part of the country before the Hungarians could assemble, and then quickly retreat. And the Hungarians did the
2 The camp and the battle are traditionally located at a place called Muhi puszta.
3 There is no other evidence of a Hungarian king handing out flags to the leaders of his troops. in later sources, however, the units that went to war under the command of major lords or county ispáns were called banderia (from italian bandiera, ‘banner’). True, Anonymus put flags into the hands of the ninth-century Magyars (see above, pp. 89, 99), but this reflects early thirteenth-century practice.

Hungari vero, et quia fuerunt taliter occupati et illorum preventi astutia, cum armati equos suos ascendebant, nequibant milites suos dominos et domini suos milites invenire et, cum ad pugnam accederent, tepide ac remisse accedebant; tanta erat crebrosa emissio sagittarum, quod fere umbram pugnantibus faciebant, et sagitte, sicut locuste et bruccus congregatim vadunt, per aera volabant.

same in Cumania. But not now: the present was no way like the past. Nevertheless, a thousand warriors were deployed every night to guard the army. what more? The Tatars found a ford far from the army and crossed overnight; at dawn, they surrounded the entire royal army and started shooting arrows like a hailstorm. The Hungarians, being both disconcerted and outwitted by their ruse, armed and mounted their horses, but the soldiers could not find their commanders, the commanders their men and, when they set out to battle, they marched faintly and slackly. Arrows were shot into the air so densely that they almost covered the warriors in shadow and flew like locusts and grasshoppers that move in swarms. Unable to resist the shower of arrows, they returned to the camp. There the king was unable to set up battle lines. when the various parts of the Hungarian army went to battle in disarray, the Tatars opposed them with arrows and forced them to return to camp. Because of the great heat and crowded space, they were so exhausted that the king and the archbishop of Kalocsa, frightened and anxious, were unable to send them to fight with threats or blandishments and warnings, as they had been constrained from dawn till noon. finally, when it seemed that their strength would altogether leave them, prince Coloman, the king’s brother, mustered what men he could in the crush and fought a very hard battle with the Tatars on one side of the encampment, fighting all day long. But he was disappointed in his hope that the rest of the army would come to his aid. They thought that most of the warriors were joining battle on the other flank of the army; yet they did not go to fight, because the Tatars stepped back a little and opened up among themselves a point of exit where they did not shoot. Therefore, ever more Hungarians left the army using this way; and the more that had left the wider the gap that the Tatars opened. No message, not a word, was passed among them in this great battle. while the king thought that they were going into battle, they were escaping rather than going to fight. The Tatars did not move, waiting for the king’s troops. when the way was free on several sides for the royal troops, the king, unrecognized by them, found his way with a few followers to the

1 Roger’s description of the battle, obviously based on reports from participants, though fragmentary, does not contradict the more detailed account of Thomas of Split (pp. 261–73). The latter must have received information from persons in the king’s entourage who had escaped to Dalmatia. The reconstruction of the battle is everywhere based on these two accounts. Some other authors, likewise later and at second-hand, describe Batu’s reluctance to engage the sizeable Hungarian army on the one hand and his threatening his warriors not to flee, on the other (see Göckenjan, Mongolensturm, n. 142, p. 210-1).
2 There were three major ferries across the Danube in medieval pest. One in the north (where today Káposztásmegyer lies), one at the foot of the island (now called St Margaret’s), and one below St Gerald’s Hill, called “of pest.” Coloman probably used the last of these.

And, although the citizens asked him to wait a little, at least until they had prepared boats to ferry their lady wives, they could not restrain him nor convince him of this; he said that everyone should look out for himself. fearing his pursuers, he immediately crossed alone and ran to Somogy to a certain village called Segesd.3 Even though the citizens of pest hurried to cross with their families, the Tatars caught up with them and those who did not drown in the Danube perished by the sword.

3 Segesd in southwestern Hungary was the center of a royal estate, at that time assigned to prince Coloman. in May 1241, Coloman joined his brother in zagreb, where he died from the wounds received at Muhi. He was buried in the Dominican nunnery of ivanić-Grad.
4 Bartholomew, scion of a Burgundian noble family, came to Hungary in the train of Queen Jolanta, second wife of Béla iV. He is listed among the prelates who joined the king in Dalmatia (Thomas of Split, p. 293); see lászló Koszta, “Un prélat français en Hongrie: Bertalan évèque de pécs (1219–1251),” Cahiers d’études hongroises 8 (1996), pp. 71–96.

The slaughter among both those fleeing on the broad road towards pest and those who stayed with the army was so enormous, so many thousand men perished, that one cannot estimate it nor can one very well trust reports as the loss was so huge. Among the major ecclesiastics these fell: Archbishop Matthias of Esztergom,1 who was especially favored by the king and whose counsel he trusted much in important matters, for they grew up together and he was most faithful; Archbishop Ugolin of Kalocsa, scion of a most noble line,2 who, setting aside minor matters was in charge of great and pressing secular business; it was in him that the Hungarian nobles had confidence and it was to him that both the great and less great men humbly gave their devotion; Bishop Gregory of Győr,3 noble in virtue and erudite in letters; Bishop Raynald of Transylvania,4 and James, the bishop of the church of Nitra, a man of laudable conduct and famous for the excellence of his morals;5 provost Nicholas of Sibiu, vice-chancellor of the king of a noble kindred,6 who, before he submitted to inevitable death cut off the head of a Tatar chief; Eradius, archdeacon of Bács; and Master Albert, archdeacon

No mortal may have certain knowledge of the major and lesser laymen who drowned in the marshes and rivers, were consumed by fire, or perished by the sword. Many dead bodies lay on the fields and roads, some beheaded, some dismembered, burnt to death in the villages and churches to which they fled. This disaster, this devastation, this massacre occupied the roads for a distance of two days’ walk and the whole earth was red with blood. Corpses lay around as common as flocks of cattle or sheep or pigs standing on open ground to pasture or like stones cut for a building in a quarry. The water had the drowned bodies; these were devoured by the fishes, worms and water fowl. The earth took possession of those who fell from poisoned lances, swords and arrows; they were gnawed away to the bone by flying birds red with blood and domestic or wild animals with sharp teeth. And fire got hold of those bodies that were burnt to death in the villages and churches. Sometimes the fat from such burnings even extinguished the fire so that these took a long time to be consumed. One will be able for a long time to find in many places charred bones wrapped in charred skin but not fully consumed, for these are not favored as food by any animals, unless they perished otherwise. So, as all the corpses became the possession of the three elements, let us see what remained for the fourth one. The air, held to be the fourth element, received the stench of the corpses from the three others; the air was so spoiled and poisoned by the stench that the wounded who remained half-alive in the fields, roads, and forests expired because of the poisoned air, though they might have otherwise survived. in this way, air also participated in this cruel ruin. what may be said of all the gold, silver, horses, arms, garments and other chat

This ruined me and all Hungary, because we gave credit to the truth of the letter and, although we beheld the very opposite every day, we could not send out scouts to ascertain the truth, for the country had been hit all at once by the confusion of war. Thus, occupied Hungary could not find a way to escape. But we left aside the matter of the king, so let us now return to his progress, or more correctly, his departure.

Having escaped from the camp, the king turned with a few men towards the border of poland whence he hurried on the shortest route, as fast as he could, to reach the queen who was staying at the border of Austria. Thereupon the duke of Austria, bearing evil in his heart, went to meet him under the guise of friendship. The king, who had escaped only by the will of God all the dreadful arrows and poisoned swords and had traveled so far, laid down his arms and wanted to find a little rest in sleep at the riverside while a meal was being prepared. woken up, he beheld the duke and was very glad. The duke asked the king, with words of solace, to cross the Danube, as he might stay and rest there in greater safety. Hearing this, the king, innocently suspecting no evil, followed the duke’s words. The duke said that on the other side he had a

Et cum rex Scillam vitare crederet, incidit in Caribdim et, sicut piscis volens vitare frixorium, ne frigatur, ad assandum proiicit se ad prunas credens malum effugere, invenit nequius. Nam dux Austrie asturia excogitata cum rege suum ad libitum potitus extitit, ab eo quandam pecunie quantitatem, quam dicebat olim ab eo regem extorsisse,1 repetiit. Quid plura? Rex manus illius evadere nequivit, quousque partem eiusdem pecunie in prompto, partem in vasis aureis et argenteis illi persolvit, pro parte autem tres comitatus sui regni illius terre contiguos illi obligavit.2 Et, licet ipsa vasa aurea et argentea maioris fuerint estimationis, tamen dux illa solum in duobus milibus marcarum3 simul cum lapidibus pretiosis recepit. Dux autem illico castrorum illorum comitatus corporali possessione est adeptus et illa ex propriis pecuniis contra Tartaros fecit reparare. Si queratur, quanta fuit pecunie quantitas, est ignotum, nam alii de septem, quidam de novem, ceteri de decem marcarum milibus referebant. Sed de veritate liquere non poterat, quia secrete contractus fecerant et firmaverant propriis iuramentis. Quibus expeditis ad reginam, que non multum distabat, quantum potuit, festinavit et una cum ipsa sine tractu more Stephanum waciensem episcopum4 ad imperialem et Romanam curiam pro subsidio destinavit et interim circa Segesdinum5 cum illis, quos aggregare potuit, moram traxit.
1 The reference is most likely to the reparation payment imposed on the duke in the peace concluded after the Austro-Hungarian conflict in the summer of 1235 (still under Andrew ii).

Then, when the king thought he had avoided Scylla, he was caught by Charybdis and, like the fish trying to avoid being fried in the pan that jumps into the embers and gets roasted, in order to avoid the bad he came to worse. when the duke of Austria had by this invented ruse brought the king under his will he demanded from him a certain sum of money which he said that the king had earlier extorted from him.1 what more? The king could not escape from him until he had paid that money, partly in cash, partly in gold and silver vessels, and pledged him three counties of his country, adjacent to his land.2 Although the gold and silver vessels were worth much more, the duke accepted them for a mere two thousand marks, including the precious stones.3 Then the duke at once took actual possession of the castles of the counties and had them fortified from his own money against the Tatars. if someone should ask, how much the ransom was, that is not known, for some spoke of seven, other nine, and many of ten thousand marks, but the truth cannot be discerned, because the contract was made in secret and confirmed by their oaths. Then the king hastened to the queen, who was nearby, and without delay sent her, together with Bishop Stephen of Vác,4 to the imperial court and the Roman Curia for help, while he, with those he could assemble around him, stayed in the neighborhood of Segesd.5
3 A Hungarian mark in this time was worth ca. 233.35 g of silver.

33 HOw THE DUKE Of AUSTRiA DESpOilED THE HUNGARiAN REfUGEES, AND Of THE iNCURSiON Of THE GERMANS iNTO HUNGARY
The duke, seeing that all the Hungarians had taken flight, collected a number of soldiers and sent them to Hungary against the Hungarians, so that while the Tatars were raging on the one side of the Danube, the Germans looted the other. They burned as many villages as they could, marched into the city of Győr, seized the castle and planned to hold it by force. The Hungarians of the region gathered together and moved in arms to the castle, took it and burnt all the Germans in it. The duke became very angry because of this and turned against the Hungarians escaping from the Tatars, whom he had assembled in Austria and to whom he had promised trust, and, not satisfied with what he extorted from the king, he demanded a certain amount of money from them for the defense of the castles and towns. On this pretext he wickedly despoiled them to the last penny, as both the Germans1 and Hungarians had plenty of money and chattels. And the hapless Hungarians were everywhere devoured by a most bitter bite2 by the sharp teeth of wild animals and then thrown forth and disgorged naked upon the shore.3 But having dealt with this let us now report on the kings of the Tatars who later marched into Hungary.

34 HOw THE TATARS TOOK ORADEA BY STORM AND HOw THEY pRESSED ON TO TăMAşDA AND BEYOND
As we said before, King Qadan, having taken Rodna and captured ispán Aristald, selected the best six hundred armed Germans who were under the said ispán. Guided by them, they crossed forests, woods, rocks and gorges and arrived beneath the city of Oradea. The city was very famous in Hungary, therefore many nobles, ladies and peasant women had gathered there. Even though the bishop had left with some of the canons, i stayed there with the remaining people. we had the castle, which we saw damaged on one side, repaired with a strong wall, so that we could find refuge there should we be unable to defend the city. But when one day the Tatars suddenly arrived and my situation in the city was precarious, i did not want to go to the castle, but ran away into the forest and hid there as long as i could. They, however, suddenly took the city and burnt down most of it and left nothing outside the walls of the castle. Having collected the booty, they killed men and women, commoners and nobles alike, on the streets, houses, and fields. what more? They pardoned neither sex nor age. That done, they suddenly retreated, gathered up everything in the retreat, and settled at five miles from the castle. They did not return for days, and those in the castle thought that they had left because of the strength of the castle that was protected by a deep moat and wooden towers on the walls; there were many armored warriors there, and whenever the Tatars came scouting from time to time, the Hungarian warriors chased them on fast horses. when the Tatars did not come to the castle for several days and everyone thought that they had completely withdrawn from there, many of the warriors and others who were in the castle, confident that they had withdrawn, left the castle and moved together into the houses that still remained outside of it. Then, one day at dawn, the Tatars, whose whereabouts they could not know, rushed upon them and killed most of those who did not manage to flee to the castle. Then they immediately sur

They did not stop at all, and with the towers and walls demolished the castle was taken by storm. They seized the warriors, canons, and others who had not been killed by the sword in the attack. The ladies, damsels and noble girls tried to escape into the cathedral. The Tatars ordered the warriors to hand over their weapons and from the canons they extorted by the cruelest tortures all that they owned. Because they could not easily enter the cathedral, they set fire to it and burnt the church, together with the women and whatever there was in the church. in other churches they perpetrated such crimes to the women that it is better to keep silent lest people get ideas for most evil deeds. Then they ruthlessly beheaded the nobles, citizens, soldiers and canons on a field outside the city. They violated the saints’ graves,1 trampled upon the relics with their sinful feet, smashed to pieces the censers, crosses, golden chalices and vessels, and whatever else was designed for the service of the altar. They dragged men and women alike into the churches and shamefully mistreated and then killed them there. After they had destroyed everything, and an intolerable stench arose from the corpses, they left the place empty. people hiding in the nearby forests came back to find some food. And while they were searching among the stones and the corpses, the Tatars suddenly returned and of those living whom they found there, none was left alive. And this slaughter was repeated day after day. They finally left for good only when there was no one else to kill. we, who stayed in the forest among the border obstacles, took flight at night towards Tămaşda, a large German village on the Criş River.2 But the Germans did not let us cross the bridge, instead many of them insisted that we had to defend their fortified city together with them, which didn’t please us at all. So we turned off to an island, which was being well fortified by the people from Adea,

1 while the latin is not quite clear, it seems that the reference is to three villages (Hung.: ágya, Vajda, Gerót) that were settlements in medieval County zaránd, ca. 50 km south of Oradea. The island must have been one in the flood land of the Crişul Alb River. 2 it is unclear what kind of local office-holder Roger refers to as procurator.

Since i dared not go on, i stayed with them upon the request of the headman2 and all the people of that place. for no one could enter the said island save by one very narrow and small way with three gates and towers within one mile and all around strong obstacles for a mile. when i realized that this place was so well fortified, i liked it and stayed there. The custom on the island was that anyone could come in but no one was allowed to leave. when i had been there for a few days with my servants, our scouts reported that the Tatars were approaching. i secretly went out from the island to find out how we could save our horses. i hired a guide and a servant—each of us leading three horses—and hastened by night to the city of Cenad on the Mureş River,3 eight miles from the island. As we were riding all night as fast as our horses could carry us, at dawn we reached Cenad.4 But a day before, it had been taken and destroyed by the Tatars who had entered Hungary from the other side.5 The whole region was occupied, so we could not cross the river. And, since our horses were tired and people from the region were hiding here and there, we could in no way return. we left our horses in some huts and hid for the day in some pits. At nightfall, we crept back amidst the Tatars with great difficulty and fear to the old place and entered the island, eyes downcast, and ashamed. while we were in such danger, my servants, who were guarding the horses outside and some others, who were with me fled from the island with all my money and clothing.

4 The distance of eight miles compared to a whole night’s ride is somewhat problematic unless Roger counted German miles, which would have made the distance some 60 km. But, as the location of the island is unknown, nothing more can be said of this apparent contradiction.

They gave out that that they would attack the island from the water; thus, the island’s people were tricked into defending it from that side. The Tatars, however, stormed the unguarded gates on the other side, seized them, and took the island without any of us having shot an arrow or engaging them on horseback or on foot.

the land in an area of three days’ walk came to be repopulated and every village chose its king from among the Tatars at its will. After this, all brought in the crops, as it was harvest time, including the hay and the straw and everything else to be stored. Many of the Tatars and the Cumans who were there with us, looked at all this and enjoyed and were delighted that fathers redeemed their lives through their daughters, husbands through their wives, brothers through their pretty sisters, kept for their pleasure. Their recreation was to rape the girls or wives before the fathers’ or husbands’ eyes. They set kneses,1 that is, bailiffs, over the people in order to render justice and supply them with useful horses, animals, weapons, presents and clothing. My headman2 was one of these lords and administered almost thousand villages; and there were some hundred such kneses.3 So we had peace, courts of law, and everyone obtained justice. The most beautiful girls were sent to them and those who procured them received for such presents sheep, oxen or horses. The kneses met almost every week. i often went there with my knes to see their way of life and get to know some chief men and to find out whether there was any way of getting free. Once, all the kneses gave the order that from certain villages the men, women and children should appear before them with gifts. we were quite frightened by this news, for we did not know its reason. Therefore, i chose to go with the kneses to the army rather than stay in the village in such uncertainty.4 we remained behind to guard the carts, unclothed and unshod in the tent of certain Hungarians who in deeds had become Tatars.5 The kneses went to receive the gifts and, after they had received them, they led the bearers of the gifts into a valley and killed them there, after terribly despoiling and stripping them naked.
3 The numbers are clearly overstatements as there were surely not several thousand villages in the Mongol held territory. 4 it is unclear what Master Roger decided to do.

when the news of this reached me, i subjected myself to a Hungarian, who, as i said, had already become a Tatar in deeds. He gracefully deigned to accept me as his servant. After a few days with him, i always saw death with my physical and mind’s eyes. During that time i saw innumerable Cumans and Tatars everywhere returning with their carts loaded with booty, herds, beasts of burden, and other necessities. inquiring what this meant, i was told that they had during one single night surrounded all the remaining villages and made their swords drunk with the blood of the slain,2 so that very few could escape from these villages. They went hiding in the forests and caves, so that the province remained totally desolate]. Yet they did not burn the crops, straw or some houses, but arranged all this to save their lives. from this i firmly concluded that they intended to spend the winter in this area or send their servants here to find shelter and fodder for their horses. This proved to be correct, as i learnt later. They left people alive for a time with the proviso that the corn crop should be brought together and the grapes harvested, but they did not want them to consume what they had brought in.

dies had taken refuge as if in a fortified castle. The Tatars did not want to attack these places until they had devastated the region all around. Sometimes, however, they approached them, but the Hungarian warriors chased them off to quite a distance, and thus they started to believe that they might stay unharmed because of their military strength. After the devastation of the region, they surrounded the great village with a combined force of some Tatars together with Russians, Cumans and their Hungarian prisoners. They sent first the Hungarian prisoners ahead and when they were all slain, the Russians, the ishmaelites,1 and Cumans went into battle. The Tatars, standing behind them all at the back, laughed at their plight and ruin and killed those who retreated from the battle and subjected as many as they could to their devouring swords, so that after fighting for a week, day and night, and filling up the moat, they captured the village. Then they made the soldiers and ladies, of whom there were many, stand in a field on one side and the peasants on the other. Having robbed them of their money, clothing and other goods, they cruelly executed them with axes and swords, leaving only some of the ladies and girls alive, whom they took for their entertainment. Only those survived who quickly fell to the ground among the dead and could hide, besmirched by the blood of others. Oh pain, oh the cruelty and immense rage of this savage people! for whoever contemplates with sane mind the destruction of such a great nation cannot help but call this rightly a field of blood.2 A few days later, they besieged the said cloister or monastery of igriş with several siege engines. Those inside could not hold out and, to save their lives, they gave themselves up to the hand and faith of the Tatars. But the same happened to them as to the others, excepting a few monks whom they allowed to leave, and some ladies and the prettiest girls whom they retained for their own use. what else? were we to describe every battle and all the boundless cruelty that transpired, what transpired would make the readers’ hearts tremble and their ears ring from the frightful words.

such horrible news spread all over the world, the princes of this world would think differently. Behold, during that summer they destroyed everything all the way to the borders of Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, poland, Silesia, and Cumania as far as the Danube.
38 THE EXTRAORDiNARY ClEVERNESS Of THE TATARS iN CROSSiNG THE DANUBE
Because Esztergom surpasses all and every city in Hungary,1 the Tatars planned above all to cross the Danube and set up their camp there. And behold, that winter there was so much snow and ice that the Danube froze over, which had not happened for a long time. But the Hungarians every day broke up the ice on their side and guarded the Danube in such a way that the foot soldiers continuously fought on the ice. Still, when a strong frost arrived and the Danube froze entirely, the Tatars did not try to cross with their horses. watch what they did! They led many horses and other animals to the bank of the Danube and for three days left no one to guard them and the animals seemed to roam around unguarded, nor did any of them show up there. Then, the Hungarians, believing that the Tatars had left, swiftly crossed and led the animals across the ice. The Tatars observed this and realized that it was possible to cross the ice safely on horseback. They did just that and in one rush so many had crossed that they covered the land on this side of the Danube. King Qadan, in turn, hastened after the king of Hungary, who was tarrying in Slavonia, as he had received no help. Anticipating this, he took to flight and, since he did not find the castles on the seacoast suitable, crossed to the islands2 and stayed on the islands until the Tatars left. King Qadan, however, seeing that he could not catch him, wasted Bosnia and Serbia3 and thence marched into Bulgaria.
The city was inhabited partly by Latini, settlers from Romance-speaking regions (as mentioned below).
2 King Béla moved first to Trogir in Dalmatia, but later even further to the near-by island of Čiovo. 3 The latin Rascia (Slav.: Raška) meant Serbia.

39 HOw THE TATARS DESTROYED ESzTERGOM
Another part of the army turned towards Esztergom, but only a few went that far; they mostly settled some distance away and prepared some thirty siege engines. Those of Esztergom had meanwhile fortified themselves with moats, walls and wooden towers. The innumerable commoners and very rich burghers, knights, nobles, and ladies who gathered in that remarkable fortress were so self-confident that they thought they could resist the whole world. Behold, one day the Tatars surrounded the city, and the prisoners who were with them brought so many bundles of twigs that on one side of the city they all at once built a tall wall of these bundles above the brow of the moat and the thirty siege engines were placed behind that wall. They shot stones at the city and at the wooden towers day and night. This caused such chaos in the city and brought such gloom to the people’s minds that they forgot all about defenses and quarreled among themselves like blind and foolish men. Then, once the Tatars had demolished the wooden towers, they threw with their engines bags full of earth to fill up the moat. None of the Hungarians or the others dared to appear on the brow of the moat because of the stones and arrows. when the Hungarians and the french and lombards, who were like the lords of the city, realized that they could not hold out, they set fire to the suburb and the wooden houses of which there were many, all the way to the stone palaces. in the houses they burned immense amount of dyed cloth and garments, slaughtered the horses, buried gold and silver, and hid whatsoever goods they had before retiring to the palaces to defend themselves. when the Tatars found out that all by which they wanted to get rich had been burnt, they became very angry and swiftly closed off the city with wooden palisades, so that whoever tried to escape would run into the throat of the sword. Then they started to besiege the palaces. Having taken them swiftly, i believe, to tell the truth, that no more than fifteen people were not killed basely in or outside the city.

All, about three hundred of them, were led out of the city to the prince and asked for the gift of being left alive under his rule. He, however, in his anger for not having won any booty, ordered them to be robbed and beheaded. And that was done right away. They could not take the citadel of the city, because the Spaniard Simon manfully defended it with his many crossbowmen.2 And when they reached the city of Székesfehérvár that is surrounded by marshes, they could not take it because the snow and ice was about to melt. And while they were besieging the castle of St Martin of pannonia,3 manfully defended by the abbot, they were suddenly called back,4 so that only these three places remained unconquered in that region.

On the command of the chief kings, we started to retreat across the wastelands with carts loaded with booty and arms, and herds of cattle and sheep, slowly searching all the hiding places and the darknesses of the forests, to find while retreating what they had missed when advancing. Thus, moving back slowly, we reached Transylvania, where many people had survived and where several castles were been readied after the Tatars had been there. what more? with the exception of a few castles,1 they occupied the whole country and as they passed through, they left the country desolate and empty. Then they left Hungary and marched into Cumania. Now they did not allow, as they had before, that whole animals be slaughtered for the prisoners indiscriminately, but only the intestines, heads, and feet of the animals were given to them. we feared—and heard from the interpreters—that once we left Hungary, we would all be given to their devouring swords. As i had no hope of survival, and a bitter and cruel death was already waiting at the door, i thought it were better to die here than to be tortured by the steady stings [of fear].

My servant hid farther way, so that the chance detection of the one should not cause the unhappy capture of the other. we lay thus for two full days, as in graves, not raising our heads and heard the terrible voices of those who, following the footprints of erring beasts, passed close by in the forest and often shouted after the prisoners who were in hiding.

Et, cum pios sermones huiusmodi conferemus, affuit unus homo, ad quem, cum se nostrorum acies extenderet oculorum, fugam inivimus timorosam nec avertimus oculos fugiendi, ut intueremus, si nobis previus esse posset vel foret nobis fugientibus subsequela. Sed non minus ipsum vidimus vices assumere precursoris, credebat enim, quod virtus nostra prevalida insidias sibi poneret per obliquum. Et, cum communis inspector traderet et teneret, quod fugitivi conspicerent fugitivum armorumque delatio apud illos nulla foret, stetimus advocantes nos adinvicem nutibus atque signis. Et, cum unus daret de se ipso alteri notionem, prolixis sermonibus atque piis deliberando decrevimus, quid agere deberemus. Sed angustia geminata, videlicet fame execrabili et timore mortis anxie torquebamur ita, quod privari videbamur penitus lumine oculorum. Nam nequibamus succum herbarum silvestrium deglutire vel ipsas herbas, uti faciunt bestie, masticare. Et, licet nos tanta famisa perurgeret et stupende mortis aculeus immineret, prestabat tamen nobis vivendi fiducia fulcimentum et evadendi spes fortitudinem ministrabat. Et sic assumpta fiducia in domino confortati1 ad extrema silve pervenimus affectuose, ascendimus arborem eminentem et terram conspeximus a Tartaris desolatam, quam non destruxerant veniendo. O dolor! Terram depopulatam et vacuam cepimus peragrare, quam in eundo dimiserant desolatam.

arms and legs. we finally met and began in low and feeble voices to utter to each other the sad complaints of our tormenting hunger. we mournfully wept and groaned that it would have been easier to die by the sword than let the bond of our limbs and the unity of body and soul fall apart through starvation. while we were exchanging such words of consolation, a man appeared and as soon as we set our eyes on him, we took to fearful flight and did not turn our sight away [from him] to see whether he was gaining or falling behind us in flight. But we saw that he was not trying to be a roadrunner, for he thought that we might use our advantage to trap him from the side. Thus, when we had mutually observed that we were all fugitives and unarmed, we stopped and made contact with nods and signs. when we had all realized who we were, we discussed in long and friendly conversation what to do. But we were doubly distressed, namely by wretched hunger and fear of death, so that we seemed almost to have lost our eyesight, for we were unable to swallow the sap of the plants of the forest or chew the grass as cattle do. And, although such great hunger beset us and the sting of numbing death threatened, we nevertheless obtained strength from confidence in living, and our hope in escape gave us courage. Thus, taking confidence and strengthened in the lord,1 we excitedly reached the edge of the forest. we climbed a tall tree and surveyed the land destroyed by the Tatars that they had not wasted when they first came. what pain! we began to walk across the waste and abandoned land that they had destroyed while retreating. Church towers were our way signs from one place to another and the road they marked for us was rough. The roads and paths had vanished; grass and thorn bushes had taken over. leeks, purslane, onions and garlic, left in the gardens of the peasants, were, when they could be found, brought to me as the choicest delicacies; the others made do with mallow, houseleek and cowbane roots. we filled our hungry stomachs with these and the spirit of life was revived in our drained bodies. We were weary and no rest was given

dabatur,1 utpote qui absque tecto et operimentuma, quo nostra tegeremus capita, non habentes nocturno tempore quiescebamus. Tandem vix octavo die a silve recessu ad Albam2 venimus civitatem, in qua nihil potuit reperiri, preterquam ossa et capita occisorum, basilicarum et palatiorum muros dirruptos et subfossos, quos nimia Christiani cruoris effusio macularat. Et, licet terra innoxium sanguinem, quem inebriata suxerat, non monstraret, ostendebant se lapides adhuc cruore roseo purpuratos, per quos absque continuato gemitu amaris suspiriis festinus transitus non fiebat. Et erat ibi ad decem miliaria iuxta silvam villa, que frata3 dicitur in vulgari, et infra silvam ad quattuor miliaria mons mirabilis et excelsus, in cuius summitate lapis et petra fundabatur terribilis; magna ibi hominum et mulierum confugerat multitudo, qui nos gratanter cum fletu receperunt interrogabantque nos de nostris periculis, que nos omnia illis paucis verbis declarare nequiebamus. Obtulerunt tandem nobis nigrum panem de farina et contritis corticibus quercuum pistatos, sed nobis dulcor illius supra semiliasb quandocunque per nos comestas suavior videbatur. Mansimus igitur ibidem uno mense nec fuimus ausi discedere, sed mittebamus semper speculatores ex hominibus levioribus videre et rescire, si adhuc que pars Tartarorum in Hungaria remansisset aut si arte deceptoria, ut prius, instructi pro capiendis reliquis fuga lapsis reverterentur. Et, quamvis sepius necessitate querendi victualiac cogente loca petierimus quondam habitata, nunquam tamen noster tutus fuit descensus, donec rex Bela marittimis de partibus4 per cruciferos de insula Rodi et dominos de frangapanibus5 multis agminibus militum adiuntus certificatus prius per Hungaros de recessu Tartarorum in Hungariam venit.

2 Alba iulia (Gyulafehérvár, German Karlsburg), a settlement with Roman prehistory (Apulum), was for centuries the seat of the bishop of Transylvania; the Romanesque cathedral was built in the late eleventh century. Roger’s plural for basilicas is warranted by the number of archaeologically established church buildings in the city.

us,1 as we took our nightly rest with no roof above us and no cover for our heads. finally, on the eighth day after leaving the forest, we arrived at the city of Alba iulia.2 There we found noting save the bones and skulls of the dead, the destroyed and broken walls of basilicas and palaces, soiled by the blood of an enormous numbers of Christians. The earth did not show the blood of the innocent, for it had absorbed it inebriated, but the stones were still cloaked with crimson blood and we could not hurry through them without continuous groans and bitter sighs. Ten miles from there, next to the forest, was a village, called frata3 in the vernacular, and here, four miles within the forest, a marvelously high mountain. On the peak of it was a rock, a looming crag, where a great number of men and women had taken refuge. They received us with joy among tears and inquired about the perils we had passed through, all of which we could not tell them in a few words. finally they gave us black bread, baked of flour and the ground bark of oak trees, and it tasted sweeter than any simnel-cake we had ever eaten. we stayed there for a month and dared not leave, but kept sending out scouts from among the more nimble folk to find out whether a group of Tatars still remained in Hungary or whether they were about to return, skilled in the art of cunning, to capture the surviving runaways. Although we often visited the formerly inhabited villages, forced by the need for food, it was never safe for us to come down until King Béla returned to Hungary with many companies of warriors from the maritime region,4 assisted by the Knights of Rhodes and the lords frankapan,5 having been previously informed by Hungarians of the retreat of the Tatars.
3 The location is problematic. if frata (Hung.: Magyarfráta), ca. 35 km east of Cluj is meant, it is ca. 80 km north from Alba iulia—which would be some ten German miles—then it is not unlikely to have been reached by the fugitives. However, no high mountain is known near by. 4 The king returned from Dalmatia in August 1242.
5 The names of the two allies of the king must have been altered for the first edition. The Knights of St John acquired Rhodes only in 1291, after Roger’s death, and the counts of Veglia (Krk) used the name de Frangepanis only after 1428. The assistance of the counts of Krk was gratefully mentioned by King Béla in a charter from 1255 (fejér, Cod. Dipl., 4/2, p. 309).
