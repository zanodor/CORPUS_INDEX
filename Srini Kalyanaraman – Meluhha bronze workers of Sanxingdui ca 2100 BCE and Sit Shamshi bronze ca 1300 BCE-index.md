Meluhha bronze workers of Sanxingdui ca. 2100 BCE
and Sit Shamshi bronze, ca.1300 BCE
--Sun-worship, large eyes, pronounced nose signify bronze-age Meluhha artisans and seafaring merchants of Sarasvati Civilization
The boat coffin burials is significant. The boat adorns the hat of a Sanxingdui male head.

I submit that this boat used as a coffin signifies that the person buried is a member of Meluhha boat people, seafaring merchants. The dug boats and catamarans (sangada) which are coir-rope sewn boats of Meluhha seafaring merchants, have been attested in Ayn Soukhna, dated to ca. 19th cent. BCE.

The eye as an Indus Script hieroglyph: kāṇá 'one-eye' rebus: kāṇā 'wealth, goods, possessions'
See:
kaṇā, kānā ‘The spine or back-bone'; kāṇá 'one-eye' Rebus Meluhha kāṇā 'wealth, goods, possessions' https://tinyurl.com/4xznbzdu
I submit that the most significant artiface discovered at Sanxingdui is the bronze spoked-wheel which signifies arka 'sun's rays' rebus arka 'copper, gold'.
A bronze wheel discovered at Sanxingdui, with a radius of 85 centimeters, looks like a modern steering wheel, but scholars believe it to be a representation of the sun. (VCG)

The knowledge conveyes relates to the metalwork which was a revolutionary advance during the Bronze Age because of the creation of metal alloys: copper + zinc = brass; copper+tin = bronze. Work also advanced with meteoric iron, ferrite ores: magnetite, hematite and laterite. The key was the hardening of copper by adding other minerals to create karaDa 'hard alloys' which had immense utility and exchange value.
Documentation of this knowledge gained with material resources (minerals, metals and alloys) processed through furnaces, smelters was done on tablets and seals. These media became effective means for dissemination of the Bronze Age metallurgical knowledge system."
