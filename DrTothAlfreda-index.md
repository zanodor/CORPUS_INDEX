1. Preface
“Etymological Dictionary of Hungarian” (EDH) and my two little volumes “Hungaro-Rhaetica” were and still are a huge success, unexpected even for me, since I never thought that until now already over 5’000 people would download them. My readers may thus ask why I present them now a new etymological dictionary of Hungarian. This has at least three good reasons:
First, EDH shows on approximately 1’500 pages Gostony’s 1’042 Hungarian words (“Dictionnaire d’étymologie sumérienne”, Paris 1975) in 18 language families with several dozens of languages around the world, ordered primarily according to the language families and only secondarily according to the 1’042 Hungarian-Sumerian cognates. The present dictionary, which I call “HMD”, shows 1’317 Hungarian-Mesopotamian (Sumerian, Akkadian, Rhaetic) words according to alphabetical order.
Second, Gostony’ dictionary as well as all hitherto published works on Sumerian-Hungarian, are based on outdated Sumerian dictionaries, the newest one being normally P. Anton Deimel’s “Šumerisches Lexikon” (Rome 1928ss.), but since this work is hardly available outside of libraries specialized in Assyriology, most of the Sumerian-Hungarian studies are based on Friedrich Delitzsch’s “Sumerisches Glossar” (1914) which represents the scientific level of Sumerology of the end of the 19th century. HDM is based of the Sumerian dictionary of the University of Pennsylvania which is accessible in the internet and constantly being updated.
Third, the only reliable and thus usable Sumerian-Hungarian language studies are the ones written by Ida Bobula, Sándor Csőke and Zsigmond Varga. Most of the other ones deserve the bad critics that they got, because almost each etymology is either debatable or wrong. This is one of the main reasons, why the Sumerian-Hungarian affinity, already early proposed, was never accepted by international scientists. All people who wrote Sumerian-Hungarian studies did it with best intentions – but at the end they rather damaged than helped this theory. Moreover, practically none of these works are based on sound-laws. The necessity of sound-laws and thus the right of existence of historical linguistics was even denied. HDM is based on sound-laws and presents a completely new etymological base for 1317 Hungarian words, keeping only those early Sumerian etymologies that can stand before the present state of Sumerian linguistics. HDM does not deny historical linguistics, but takes full consideration of the (Ugric, Finno-Ugric, Altaic, etc.) proto-forms that had been reconstructed by traditional historical linguists, confronts them with the possible Sumerian words and discusses divergences between Sumerian and Proto-X. Therefore, HDM does not intend to substitute traditional Hungarian etymological dictionaries, but enlarges their basis by confronting the abstract proto-forms with the concrete words of an extinct, but once living language.
I could have tried to explain more Hungarian words by Sumerian than I did. But with its 1317 entries, HMD can stand its concurrence at least in quantitative respect: “A Magyar Szókészlet finnugor elemei etimológiai szótár” contains ca. 677 and Budenz’ comparative dictionary 996 entries, concentrating only on such Hungarian words that show up at least in one other Uralic language. Since it was important to me to compare the actual Sumerian words with the reconstructed proto-forms, I restricted myself also basically only on such words, but enlarged my vocabulary from the Uralic to the Altaic language family, does presupposing that the once asserted Ural-Altaic macrofamily does exist. The other group of words I have chosen to try to explain in HMD are words that are still “of unknown origin”. In this case, HDM wants to open new ways by confronting such Hungarian words with possible Sumerian, Akkadian and Rhaetic cognates. On the other side, Bárczi’s “short” dictionary has apprioximately 8,500 entries, the big TESz has 10,714 entries and the newest, the “Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Ungarischen (EWU)”, has ca. 10,000 entries, but these latter works include all possible derivations from the simple Hungarian stems. Since these derivations are accessible in each big Hungarian dictionary (and known to the Hungarian readers anyway), I also concentrated myself only on stems, which does not exclude that I also brought derivations, if their semantics has considerably changed from the original meaning(s) of the stems.

Unlike in EDH, I do not quote scientific literature in HDM (unless it is really necessary), because unlike EDH, HDM should become a reference work not only for linguists but for specialists of other disciplines and even interested people of each genre as well. For everybody who wants to check the used as well as further literature, I recommend the several bibliographies at the ends of the 18 chapters of EDH. Since it is very well known that Finno-Ugric etymologies change from dictionary to dictionary (even in such standard works that were written under participation of the same persons almost at the same times), I cite deviant proto-forms next to one another, separated by commata.
I like to thank my great teacher and best friend, Professor Dr. Linus Brunner (1909-1987), with whom I studied Assyriology and Semitistics and without his continued mental presence I would not have been able to write HDM. Special thanks go to Flórián Farkas who has already taken care of many studies of mine and has also done an excellent job in editing HDM.

2. Introduction
“GALILEI. Ich bin es gewohnt, die Herren aller Fakultäten sämtlichen Fakten und Entdeckungen gegenüber die Augen schliessen zu sehen und so zu tun, als sei nichts geschehen. Ich zeige meine Notierungen und man lächelt; ich stelle ein Fernrohr zur Verfügung, dass man sich überzeugen kann, und man zitiert den Aristoteles. Der Mann hatte kein Fernrohr!” (Bertolt Brecht, Leben des Galilei, Grosse Berliner und Frankfurter Ausgabe, Bd. 5, S. 39ff.)
Kisütik, hoy a magyar nyelv Nincs, nem is lesz, nem is volt, Ami új van benne, mind rossz, Ami régi, az tót. (Arany János, Orthológusokra, 1880)
A preamble about reconstruction
Critics of traditional historical linguistics are right, when they state that the method of reconstruction on which historical linguistics is based, is logically circular. You realize that two words in two different languages look similar, then you assume that not only these words, but also the languages to which they belong, may be related. You go on, and if you find enough word-parallels, you try to find a system of parenthood of the two languages in establishing sound-laws. And if you have succeeded in doing so, too, than you have “proven” that your two languages are related to one another, or more exactly: genetically related to one another. (Languages may be typologically, but not genetically related, e.g. Hungarian and Basque, or genetically, but not typologically related, e.g. Sanskrit and Hindi.) Therefore, to speak in terms of logic: Your assumption is: Languages A and B are related to one another. Your theorem is: Languages A and B are related to one another. And your conclusion is: Languages A and B are related to one another.
This is a classical circulus vitiosus. But first, logic does not apply in historical linguistics. Classical logic is mono-contextural, i.e. can only differentiate between two values: positive or negative, there is no “gray-scale” between these two logical values. Languages, however, are not structured according to such a light-switch logic, and neither is linguistics. Second, nobody can deny that e.g. English “house” and German “Haus” are one and the same word because the two languages to which they belong are relatives of one another like two sisters or brothers. And where there are children, there also must be parents, grandparents and so on. This leads directly to reconstruction and thus to historical linguistics: tracing back the children to their earliest possible ancestors. In linguistics, these ancestors are called proto-forms. Third, the critics have offered a synchronic instead of this diachronic (historical) method of reconstruction: Instead of tracing back words to their proto-forms, they want to isolate the stems of these words, then compare them to stems of other languages, and if they turn out to be identical, than the languages to which they belong, are identical, and if not, then they are not related. Here is to ask: How do these critics know what is stem and what are derivational formants (e.g. prefixes, infixes, suffixes)? And how do they know if two stems of two languages are not identical or similar by chance (e.g. Engl. “house” and Hung. ház, the latter one is related to Engl. “hut”, but not to “house”)?

However, I agree with these critics about circularity in historical linguistics insofar, as it is really circular first to reconstruct a proto-form (to which one needs already sound-laws) and then to “reconstruct” sound-laws from the proto-forms. But here there is a better solution than the synchronic comparison that turns out to be impossible, as just shown: After having reconstructed proto-forms one has the possibility to compare these abstract proto-forms with real words of living or extinct languages. There is only one problem: The languages one compares with one another should be from about the same time-depth. It makes no sense, if Indo-Europeanists compare, e.g., Albanian, which is not documented before the 15th century A.D., with Anatolian languages that are attested from the 18th century B.C., because in these 33 centuries that lie between these languages, many phonetical and semantical chances may have occured.
This is indeed an important point: One of the most important criticisms of traditional Finno-Ugrists against the Hungarian “Sumerologists” is telling them that it is not allowed to compare Hungarian, that is not testified before the 12th century, with Sumerian, whose earliest texts go back approximately to the 27th century B.C., thus 39 centuries lying between them. But if one combines the method of reconstruction and the method of confronting the reconstructed proto-forms with the actual words of the oldest known language at all, Sumerian, one gets in a situation similar to the reconstruction of the Romance languages’ sound-laws by confronting the words of the Romance languages with Latin, or in the case of the Slavonic languages with Old Bulgarian (Old Church Slavonic). What a kind of “Latin” would result, if one had to reconstruct it from the actual Romance languages? – One is for sure, not the Latin we know, and given the huge discrepancy in the Romance lexicon, the reconstructed “Latin” vocabulary would contain maximally a few hundred words and not the many ten thousands contained e.g. in the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae.
The dissolution of language families
Since we take the now late Dietz Otto Edzard’s criticism on Gostony’s “Dictionnaire d’étymologie sumérienne” (Paris 1975): “We cannot bridge 5’000 years’ distance simply by comparing two languages”, i.e. Hungarian and Sumerian, seriousely, we want to show, why our method to use reconstructed proto-forms as intermediaries between modern Hungarian and Sumerian words really works. We thus give here an overview about the time-depths of the language families we are concerned in HMD and their dissolution (Ausgliederung) into single languages (all dates are, of course, approximate, but officially accepted).
Nostratic (Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Altaic, Proto-Uralic, Proto-Yukaghir, Proto-ChukotkoKamtchatkan, Proto-Eskimo-Aleut, Proto-Kartvelian, Proto-Dravidian, Proto-Afro-Asiatic [formerly called Hamito-Semitic], Proto-Niwkh, Prot-Elamite, Tyrsenian, Sumerian): 18’000-12’000 B.C.
Proto-Uralo-Siberian (Proto-Uralo-Yukagir, Proto-Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Proto-Eskimo-Aleut):
6000-4000 B.C.
Proto-Altaic (Proto-Turkic, Proto-Mongolian, Proto-Tungusic) 6000 B.C.
Proto-Uralic (Proto-Finno-Ugric, Proto-Samoyed):
6000/4000 B.C.

Proto-Finno-Ugric (Proto-Finno-Permic, Proto-Ugric): 2500 B.C.
Proto-Ugric (Proto-Hungarian, Proto-Obugric):
1500 B.C.
Since our oldest readable Sumerian texts are from the so-called Fāra period, i.e. from the 27th century B.C., Sumerian is almost contemporaneous to Proto-Finno-Ugric. Since Akkadian, precisely Old Babylonian, is testified from the 23rd century B.C. (Sargon of Akkad) and since the same is true for his close relative, Rhaetic (cf. Brunner and Tóth 1987)1, these languages are also contemporaneous with both Sumerian and Proto-Finno-Ugric. Since our hypothesis is that Hungarian goes back to Sumerian, the objection that we do not have older Sumerian texts, is of no importance (no Indo-Europeanist is forced to go further back from Proto-Indo-European to Nostratic). It is of no importance either, that “we see Sumerian only through the glasses of Akkadian”, i.e. possibly distorted by Akkadian phonetics, as Edzard (2003) remarked, because no linguist would deal with Sumerian if it would be worthless because of this possible distortion. And what concerns the further comparison of Hungarian via ProtoUgric, Proto-Finno-Ugric and Proto-Uralic with Proto-Altaic, there is no problem either, because in these cases we compare proto-forms with proto-forms, i.e. reconstructions that have already been approved by traditional linguists.
The following etymological part of the present book will show entry by entry how the Sumerian phonemes correspond to the phonemes of the proto-languages on the one side and to the phonemes of Hungarian on the other side. Generally, it is to say that there is much more deviance between Hungarian and Proto-Ugric than between Hungarian and Sumerian. The main reason is that FinnoUgrists tend to prefer Vogul (Mansi) and Ostyak (Khanty) forms if they deviate from Hungarian, and since it seems that the Ob-Ugric languages are not or not directly related to Hungarian, the result is in many cases a Proto-Ugric form that does not fit to the Hungarian word and thus ad hoc sound-laws in order to urge the Hungarian form in the Vogul-Ostyak Procrustes bed. On the other side, if a reconstruction is not or not primarily based on Hungarian and Vogul and/or Ostyak, but also at least on one Finno-Permic form, than the reconstructed proto-form is always much closer to the Sumerian word. It can also generally be observed that the Sumerian and the Hungarian consonants fit much better to one another than the vowels of both languages do, most of all the velar vowels. The reason is clear: Sumerian, Akkadian and Rhaetic do not possess a phonem /o/, so a Hungarian dark vowel can originate in a Sumerian, Akkadian or Rhaetic /a/ or /u/. Generally, again, Sumerian fits in his vowels system better to Hungarian than Akkadian and Rhaetic do, because in Sumerian, but not in Akkadian and Rhaetic (because of their apophony) there are traces of vowel harmony that are, as well known, fully developed in Hungarian.
And once again generally: By comparing modern Hungarian words with Sumerian, Akkadian and Rhaetic words from Old Babylonian time via intermediary reconstructed proto-forms, one realizes that not the phonetical but the semantical part of reconstruction or comparison is the big problem. Traditional linguists who reconstruct proto-forms from modern forms tacitly assume that the older a word is traced back, the simpler its meaning must be. But Sumerian shows quite the opposite. In most cases it is like that: The older a word is, there more specific (and not general) a meaning of a word gets. Phylogenetically, the concrete item is primordial, the abstract one comes later. For example, the Hungarian word for “ham from a pig’s back”: top originates in Sumerian dub whose meaning is “knee” (because both the back and the knee are rounded). Yet, the reconstructed Proto-Finno-Ugric form *tuppз gives as meaning “loin” which is more abstract than “ham” or “knee/back”.
1 As I have already pointed out in the Preface, for bibliographical information I refer to my “Etymological Dictionary of Hungarian” (EDH).

A problem that I have to mention specially is that it is practically not to decide, if a Hungarian suffix, like e.g. the causative –t-, has its corresponding counterpart in a Sumerian suffix, particle or an own word. Thus, it is in most cases unclear, if a Hungarian suffix developed only in Hungarian, in one of the proto-languages or already in Sumerian. However, the many double-words that are already present in Sumerian and are highly developed in Hungarian (the so-called tükörszók) seem to point in the direction that generally Hungarian suffixes originate in Sumerian words and not in suffixes or particles. But here there is the other problem that we have no right to combine freely Sumerian words as etymological basis for Hungarian words unless they are really testified in Sumerian. For example, I accepted Badiny’s reconstruction of “Magyar” form Sumerian mah “(to be) great” + gar “(to be) heroic”, but strictly speaking, the word-combination *mah-gar is not testified in Sumerian, while e.g. igi-bad “to open the eyes (igi “eye)”, igi-bar “to look at”, igi-duh “to see” etc. are testified. Yet, o the other side, one may remark that in Romance linguistics, asterisk-forms are reconstructed where there is no corresponding actually testified Latin (or pre-Roman) word. For example, French soleil “sun” cannot originate in Latin sol “sun” (like e.g. Italian sole does), but presupposes a reconstructed diminutive form *solic(u)lu, and Buchenstein sorógle “sun” requires even a reconstruct of the already reconstructed diminutive: *soluc(u)lu). However, the etymology of “Magyar” (that must not lack in a Hungarian etymological dictionary) is the one and only case where I was inconsistent.

Akkadian kam(m)ūnum “caraway”. The Akk. and Rhaet. word is also the basis for Engl. cumin that is phonetically, but not semantically identical with Germ. Kümmel “caraway”. Engl. cumin is “Kreuzkümmel” (lit. “cross-cumin”) in Germ., and “caraway” < Old Spanish alcarahuaya < Arabic al-karawiya < Greek káron “caraway”. But if EWU (p. 816) calls words like this “Wanderwörter” (migrating words), then it is to say that not the words wander, but the people who bring these words with them. Wanderwörter are thus proofs of migrations, in this case of the Sumerians and the Rhaetians.

Hungarian napa “mother-in-law” Proto-Uralic *anзppē Sumerian nunus, munus (3079x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, 1st millennium) wr. munus; nu-nus “woman; female”. The second part seems to be Sum. –bar that occurs in “in-law” parentships: ušbar (19x: ED IIIa, Old Babylonian) wr. ušbar; ušbar3; ušbar2 “father-in-law; mother-in-law”, cf. also Hung. ip, ipa “father-in-law” and Sum. pap (86x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. pap “father; male, virile; brother” related to Akk., Rhaet. abu “father”. The first part er- in Sum. erib “father-in-law; sister-in-law” seems to be the still unexplained word –er in emb-er “human” and may be related to Sum. ere “to go”.

Hungarian -né-/-ná, -ne/-na (conditional suffix, e.g. olvasnék “I would read”, olvasna “he/she would read”, olvasná “he/she would read it”
Sumerian na, nu (negative indicative indicator). The common origin of the negative particle Hung. nem, ne and the conditional suffix may originate in the redundant use of the negative particle with míg “until”, e.g. maradok itt míg (nem) jön “I stay here until he (*not) comes”.
Hungarian négy “four” Proto-Finno-Ugric *neljä Sumerian nimin, nīn “forty”, or niš, neš “twenty”? Due to the sexagesimal number system of Sumerian, the actual values to often not correspond with one another. So, négy could be “two times twenty [instead of two]”, since Sum. min “two”: ni-min < *niš-min, cf. French quatre-vingt “eighty, lit. for [times] twenty”.
Hungarian -nak/-nek (dative and directional suffix), neki “to him/her/it” Proto-Uralic *nä “this” + *-k (lative suffix) Sumerian ne; ne-en; ne-e “this” + (a/V)k (genitive suffix)

Hungarian öv (< ő) “belt” Proto-Uralic (?), Proto-Finno-Ugric *wiŋä, *wüŋgä “belt, girdle” Finnish vyö “waist” Lappish āvve “belt, girdle” Komi võń “band, belt, girdle, sash” Enec bine “line, strap, thong” Kamassian minä “halter, rein” Nenec jiine “cord, line, rein, rope, strap, wire” Nganasan bene “line, strap, thong” Selqup üüni “id.” Sumerian niĝin (214x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. niĝin2; niĝin “to encircle; to go around”, ib (36x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. ib2 “hips; middle”. The PFU form is only based on Komi, which shows a stem in –n that otherwise occurs in Samoyed languages only. Thus, PFU *wiŋä, *wüŋgä are wrong, the Komi word is a borrowing, and Sum. ib2 is the basis of the Hung., Finn. and Lapp. words, while Sum. niĝin is the basis of the Komi and Samoyed forms. Therefore, the Samoyed words are not related to the FU words.
Hungarian özön “deluge, flood, stream, torrent”
Sumerian biz (12x: Old Babylonian) wr. bi-iz; biz “to trickle, drip”
Hungarian -p (momentaneous suffix, e.g. állap- “to stop” [15th c.], cf. állapot “situation, condition, state”, állni “to stand”) Proto-Ugric *-ppV Sumerian šuba “apart from” (cf. Edzard 2003, p. 159) Akkadian ezib, ezub
Hungarian pajtás “bud, chum, companion, comrade, fellow, mate, pal” Akkadian bītu, bētu “house” Rhaetic *beita “hut” (Brunner and Tóth 1987, p. 97). According to EWU, p. 1097s. borrowed from Osman paydaş “comrade, person involved”. According to our etymology the meaning is “one who shares the house with sb., familiar” and proves that initial Hung. p- can be inherited, either from b- or from p (v.s.).
Hungarian panasz “order”, panaszkodik “to complain”
Rhaetic pna- “to ask/contact sb.” (Brunner and Tóth 1987, p. 98)
Hungarian papucs “slippers” Turkish pabuç “shoe” Sumerian upap (1x: ED IIIa) wr. uz-pap “a bird”. Cf. Swiss Germ. “Finken” = Eng. “finches”, i.e. the bird and the slippers have the same name. Alternatively to Sum. pag (2x: Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian) wr. pag “to enclose, confine, cage (a bird)” (inherited Hung. p-).
Hungarian para “light piece of wood on the edge of the fishing net that prevents it from sinking”
Proto-Altaic *p’árà “cross-beam, constructing piece” Proto-Turkic *AraProto-Mongolic *(h)araProto-Tungusic *para

Proto-Uralic *parз, *porз “group, mass, pile” Komi, Udmurt pur “raft” Sumerian bur, wr. ĝešbur “a tree” (inherited Hung. p-).
Hungarian pára “steam; haze, mist; fog”, párolni “to stew, to steam”
Sumerian muru (21x: Old Babylonian) wr. muru9; muru3 “rainstorm; mist; drizzle”, baršeĝ (4x: Old Babylonian) wr. bar-šeĝ3 “fog”. If the latter etymology is right, then we have another proof for inherited Hung. p- (EWU, p. 114: borrowed from a Slavonic language).
Hungarian paskolni “to clap, to slap, to hit”
Sumerian pašu (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. pa-a-šu "type of axe". Inherited Hung. p(EWU, p. 1123: onomatopoetic).
Hungarian patak “brook”
Sumerian pu (95x: ED IIIb, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. pu2 “well; fish pond; source (of river)” + tag4 “to open” (Oberhuber 1990, p. 465). Inherited Hung. p- (EWU, p. 1129: borowed from a Slavonic language).
Hungarian peregni “to move in a circle, to rate” Proto-Altaic *p’erkV “to tie around, to surround” Proto-Mongolic *hergiProto-Tungusic *perkeProto-Uralic (?), Proto-Finno-Ugric *pire(-), pirä(-) “circle, ring; to enclose, to surround” Sumerian bir (37x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. bir; bi-bi-re; bir9 “to scatter, disperse”. Inherited Hung. p- (EWU, p. 1145: onomatopoetic).
Hungarian perem “edge, rim, margin, seam” Proto-Altaic *p’èrì “edge” Sumerian bar (2579x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. bar; ba-ra; bala; bur “outside, (other) side; behind; outer form, outer; fleece; outsider, strange; back, shoulder; liver; because of; to set aside; to cut open, slit, split”. Without doubt also related is Sum. par (130x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. pa5; pa6 “(small) canal, irrigation ditch” (cf. the name of the river Ó-Perint in Vas megye). The etymology given by EWU, p. 1145 (Germ. Bräme “seam”) is thus mistaken, and we have another proof for inherited Hung. p-.
Hungarian pír “flush of dusk; red colour”, pirítani “to toast, to roast”, piros “red” Proto-Altaic *p’òre “fire; to burn” Proto-Turkic *ört Proto-Mongolic *(h)örde. Proto-Tungusic *puri-/piriSumerian bir9 “to blow; to flame up” (Oberhuber 1990, p. 59). Inherited Hung. p-. When EWU (p. 1165: onomatopoetic) keeps denying the existence of inherited Hung. p-, then the Proto-forms cited above at least prove that also “onomatopoetic” words can be inherited, which implies also the inheritance of Hung. p-. But as the Proto-forms with concrete, non-onomatopoetic meanings prove by themselves, this word-family is not onomatopoetic, either.

Hungarian pohár “glass, tankard”
Sumerian pihu, wr. dugpi-hu; dugpihu; dugpihu2; dugpihu3; dugpihu4; dugpihu5; dug|NUNUZ.AB2×IGI@g| “a beer jar”. Inherited Hung. p- (EWU, p. 1179: borrowed from Old Bavarian pehhari, German Becher “tumbler, mug”). The problem with the EWU’s etymology is why Germ. b- changed in Hung. p-, while it did not e.g. in the case of Hung. boglár “clasp, buckle” which is borrwed according to EWU (p. 116) from Middle High German buckelaere. EWU (loc. cit.) gives as alternative a borrowing of pohár from High German, but then p- cannot be explained because only Old Bavarian b- > p- from the beginning of the 8th c. and most of all at this late time vowel harmony did not apply anymore (e.g. pantofli “slippers”).
Hungarian ponk “hillock, little hill”
Sumerian bun (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. uzubun; uzubun2 “bladder”. Inherited p-.
Hungarian por “dust; powder”
Proto-Altaic *bóru “dust; smoke; whirlwind” Sumerian bur (176x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, uncertain) wr. bur2; bur “to release, free; to reveal; to spread out, cover”. Inherited p-.
Hungarian pót “substitute; extra; “nectarium” (Cuczor-Fogarasi, p. 2566)
Sumerian pu (6x: Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. pu2 “fruit orchard”. Inherited Hung. p(EWU, p. 1194: “unknown origin”).
Hungarian pödörni “to twirl, to twist”
Sumerian dub (30x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dab6; dub “to go around, encircle, turn; to search; to tarry”. Metathesis dub > *bud > pödlike in Hung. pökni vs. köpni “to spit”? (EWU, p. 1198: “probably onomatopoetic”.)
Hungarian pökni, köpni “to spit”
Sumerian uhpu (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. uh2-pu2 “foam”. EWU, p. 819, s.v. “köp”: “onomatopoetic”; pök- is lacking.
Hungarian puszi “kiss, peck” Turkish buse Uzbek bösa Sumerian sub (126x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. su-ub; sub; sub6 “to suck; to rub” with metathesis like in pödörni and pökni. The assertion of EWU (p. 1219: borrwoing form Austrian German Busserl “(little) kiss” is thus not for sure, since German could have borrowed this word from Hung., and the Hung. word that is shared by words from Altaic languages has a Sum. origin. Other words for “kiss; to kiss” like Latin basium are also of “unknown origin” (Walde 1910, p. 84).
Hungarian -r (denominative noun suffix, e.g. odor “hollow cave, pit”, odú “cavity, den, hole”)
Proto-Uralic *-r (denominative noun formant of unknwon function) Sumerian -ri (affixed particle occurring after nominalized verbal forms ending in –a, cf. Edzard 2003, p. 160)

Hungarian reg, reggel “morning”, rég “long ago”, régi “old”, rögtön “immediately” Proto-Finno-Ugric *reŋkз “hot, warm” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru "to lay down, cast, place; to throw down; to release, let go; to imbue; to pour out; to lead away". The Sum. etymology clearly shows that the original meaning of the Hung. word family is “old”, not “hot”: The morning releases the old day, imbues it (to which the night also belongs).
Hungarian rejteni “to hide, to conceal”, rejlik “to be hidden”
Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to lay down, cast, place; to set in place; to lead away”. The original meaning of Sum. ri is “to remove, to sweep away” and then “to hide”. “to sweep away” developed to “to graze” in Akk. and Rhaet., where we find re’ū “to graze; shepherd”, in which the meaning of the supervisor of the grazing animals is thus included. The feminine form of re’ū, rē’ītu “shepherdess”, became the name of the highest goddess of the Rhaetians who got their name for her which appears in Rhaetic inscriptions as Reitu and Ritu (cf. Brunner and Tóth 1987; Tóth and Brunner 2007). Therefore, while rej-l-ik goes directly back to Sum., rej-t-eni must either originate in Rhaet. rē’īt-, or the “causative suffix” was – like the verbal derivative suffix –l-, already present in Sum.
Hungarian rém “apparition, ghost”, rémálom “nightmare”, rémíteni “to frighten” Sumerian erim2 “fiend” (Oberhuber 1990, p. 147)
Hungarian repedni “to crack, to burst”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *r8ppз-, *reppз- “to burst, to rend, to split” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to throw down”; cf. also: Akkadian rapāsum “to be cracked, burst”
Hungarian repíteni “to sling, to throw”, repülni “to fly (itr.)” Proto-Finno-Ugric *r8ppз- “to beat with the wings, to fly” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to lay down, cast, place; to set in place, imbue; to lean on; to impose; to throw down; to release, let go; to walk along; to pour out; to lead away”
Hungarian rés “fissure; hole, opening” Proto-Finno-Ugric *raćз “hole” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to throw down; to pour out”
Hungarian rész “part, piece, section” Proto-Finno-Ugric *räćз “piece” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to lay down, to cast, to set in place; to lean on”

Hungarian révület “ecstasy, trance” Proto-Uralic (?), Proto-Ugric *rekз, *reŋз Sumerian rib (62x: ED IIIb, Old Babylonian) wr. rib; ri-ba “(to be) surpassing, outstanding; (to be) strong, massive”. The root-enlarging elements –k and –ŋ are based solely on the Mańśi forms rèγ and rei and are mistaken in view of the Hung. form ending on –v < -b. Thus, révület is phonetically related with ravasz “sly” to which it also belongs semantically.
Hungarian rezegni “to quiver, to shake, to tremble” Proto-Finno-Ugric *reńćз-, *rećз- “to quake, to shake” Sumerian zir (373x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. zi; ziir; ze2-er “to tear out; to break, destroy; to be troubled; to erase”. Metathesis like e.g. in pökni vs. köpni.

Hungarian róni, rov- “to carve, to engrave, to notch”, rovásírás “Magyar runic writing”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *rokз-, *roγз-, *rowз- “to cut, to notch” Sumerian hur (44x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. hur “to scratch, draw”

Sumerian ru, ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to lay down; to lean on; to walk along”
Hungarian ró-ka “fox” (-ka is diminutive suffix, cf. EWU, p. 1275) Finnish repo Sumerian rib (62x: ED IIIb, Old Babylonian) wr. rib; ri-ba “(to be) surpassing, outstanding; (to be) strong, massive” + -ga (derivative suffix of unknown meaning, possibly also diminutive), cf. ab2 “cow”, ab2-ga “milk; cow”
Hungarian rokkanni “to descend continuously closer”, rokkant “crippled, disabled; invalid”
Proto-Ugric *r8kkз- “to collapse, to fall down” Sumerian ru, ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr.

Hungarian sajt “cheese”
Akkadian (?) eqīdu “Käse”. Possible phonological development: eqīdu > *ešīdu > *šīdu > šayt = Hung. sajt. The only attested Rhaetic word for cheese was kaššu “massive, bulky” (Brunner and Tóth 1987, p. 67), which is also the basis for English “cheese” and German “Käse”.

Hungarian süllő “zander, pike-perch”
Sumerian zuhul (4x: Old Babylonian) wr. zu-hu-ul “to pierce”. The zander is zoologically a stizostedion, whereby Greek stízein (cf. Latin stingere, stīg-) means “to prick, to sting, to pierce”.
Hungarian süly “scurvy; tumor” Proto-Altaic *si_òge “wart” Proto-Turkic *sigöl, *sögil Proto-Mongolic *söγel Proto-Tungusic *sogiProto-Uralic *ćiklä, *ćüklä, *ćikl’ä, *ćüklä “wart” Karelian süglä “wart” Sumerian asag (23x: Ur III) wr. a2-sag3 “a demon; a disease” Akkadian asakku

Hungarian sütni “to bake, to broil; to shine (sun)”; sülni “to be baked, to be boiled” Proto-Ugric *čittз- “to bake, to broil; to shine” Sumerian zil (4x: Old Babylonian) wr. zil “to boil”. So, sülni and not sütni (as assumed by EWU, p. 1375) is the basic word, sütni is derived with the usual causative suffix –t-, while the –l belongs to the root, as the Sum. form shows. Thus, the problem with –tt- > -t- as well as the explication of the –l- in sülni as analogy given by EWU are mistaken, and so is the PU form.

Hungarian száguldani “to run at full speed, to rush” Proto-Ugric *ś8ŋз- “to flee, to gallop, to jump” Sumerian saĝgul (28x: ED IIIb, Ur III) wr. sag-kul; saĝ-gul “globe-lightning”. According to EWU (pp. 180s.), -uld is a suffix, but the Sum. form clearly shows that only –d- is a suffix, wile –ul belongs to the second syllable. The semantic connection between “to run” and “lightning” is given by the Hung. saying: “Megy, mint a villámlás = száguld, vágtat” (O. Nagy Gábor, Magyar szólások és közmondások. 8th ed. Budapest 1999, p. 725, no. 495) that originates in Sum., as the following example proves: “The sixth beats at the flanks of the mountains like a battering flood. The seventh flashes like lightning, and no one can deflect its power” (Gilgameš and Huwawa [Version B]: c.1.8.1.5.1). This etymology is an incontestable proof for the genetical relationship between Hungarian und Sumerian.
Hungarian szak “age, era, period; branch, profession, subject; division, part, section; stanza, strophe, verse” Proto-(Finno?-)Ugric *śakkз, *śukkз “piece” Sumerian saĝ ĝal (39x: Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. saĝ ĝal2 “(to be) measured out as a heaped amount; to measure out a heaped amount”

Hungarian szarv, szaru “horn (of an animal)” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śorwa Sumerian si (262x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. si “horn; finger; fret”
Hungarian szatócs “merchant”

Hungarian száz “hundred” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śata Sumerian sud (488x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. sud; su3-ud “(to be) distant; (to be) remote, long-lasting” or kud (1111x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, 1st millennium, unknown) wr. kud; gur5 “to break off, to cut off; to cut”. PFU *śata is believed to be either a very early borrowing or genetically related to Proto-IE *dek'om, *dek'em-; *(d)k'em-t-o-, the development of the initial consonants of which have lead to differentiate the IE languages in a centum and a satem group. Since in Sum. we have a cognate with inital s- and one with initial k-, the question arises, if the PFU form *śata is correct or not and if the words for “100” in PFU and PIE are related or not. Given the fact that in the Sumerian sexagesimal number system there was no word for “100”, both sud and kud are semantically possible.
Hungarian szedni “to collect, to gather, to pick, to pluck” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śentä “to pluck, to rip, to tear” Sumerian sig (48x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. sig7; sig8 “to pluck hair or wool; (to be) trimmed, pruned”

Hungarian szégyelleni “to be/feel ashamed”, szégyen “shame, discredit, dishonour, disgrace, scandal”
Sumerian azag (6x: Old Babylonian) wr. azag “taboo, forbidden thing” Akkadian asakku
Hungarian szék “seat, stool, chair; egg-yolk”
Sumerian zig (8574x: Lagash II, Ur III) wr. zig3 “to issue; to levy, raise, muster; to swell; to expend; to rise”, or zig, wr. zigx(|PA.GI|) "town, center". According to EWU, p. 1406, szék “egg-yolk” has nothing to do with the other word szék and is “of unknown origin”. The Sumerian etymology presented here, however, shows that starting form a basic meaning “to rise”, both words are one and the same.
Hungarian székely “Székely (member of an own ethnic Magyar group inhabiting central Transylvania and supposedly descendants of the Huns)
Sumerian zag (902x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. zag “side; border, boundary, district; limit; right side, the right”. According to EWU (p. 1407), the word is “of unknown origin”, although already the Hung. tradition calls them clearly “border-people”, left once as Eastern outpost of historical Hungary.
Hungarian szekér “cart, wagon”
Proto-Ugric *säkзrз “a kind of vehicle” Sumerian zig (8574x: Lagash II, Ur III) wr. zig3 “to issue; to levy, raise, muster; to swell; to expend; to rise” + hara, wr. harax(|NUNUZ.AB2×BI|) “a part of a wagon”. Since in Sum. “the rising” one is associated with “seat”, szekér means a wagon with a seat.
Hungarian szelni “to slice”, szelet “slice; part; schnitzel” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śälä-, *čälä- “to cut” Sumerian sil (119x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. si-il; zil; silx(|EZEN×LAL2|); sil5 “(to be) remote; to split apart; to split, slit”
Hungarian szél “edge”, széles “wide, broad” Proto-Ugric *śelз “edge, rim” Sumerian sil (119x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. si-il; zil; silx(|EZEN×LAL2|); sil5 “(to be) remote; to split apart; to split, slit”
Hungarian szél, szel- “wind”
Sumerian til (770x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. til3 “to live”. Semantically, we have here the connection of “to breathe, to live” with “to blow; breath, wind”, cf. Greek ánemos “breath, wind”, Latin animus “mind”, Greek pneîn “to blow”, pneūma “breath, wind” > “mind, soul of the world”.
Hungarian szem “eye” Proto-Uralic *śilmä Sumerian sim (4x: Old Babylonian) wr. sim; si-im “to sieve, filter”

Hungarian szép “beautiful, handsome, pretty” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śeppä “clever” Sumerian šab (25x: Old Babylonian) wr. šab “to trim; to make clear”. Since a participle in the sense of inflectional languages does not exist in Sumerian (non-finite verbal forms lack prefixes and suffixes, cf. Edzard 2003, p. 130), šab means also “trimmed, made clear” and thus “beautiful”.
Hungarian szeplő “freckle”

Hungarian szidni “to scold”, szitkozódik
Proto-Finno-Volgaic *śoδa(-), *śoδ’a(-), śota(-) “battle, strife, war; to battle, to fight” Sumerian šud (115x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. šud3; šu-tu; šudx(|KA.ŠU|) “prayer, dedication; blessing”. Semantically, cf. Latin sacer “holy; damned”

Hungarian szik “natron, alkali” Proto-Ugric *ć8kkз “salt” Sumerian sig (343x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian, 1st millennium) wr. sig “(to be) weak; (to be) low; (to be) thin; (to be) narrow”. “weak” concerning the soil means dry, and natron-soil is dry, which makes the etymological connection to aszik, aszú (v.s.). Thus, the meaning of the PU form is wrong.

Hungarian szil “elm” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śala Finnish salava “brittle willow” Sumerian sil (119x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. si-il; zil; silx(|EZEN×LAL2|); sil5 “(to be) remote; to split apart; to split, slit”. Sum. sil may also be the origin of Germ. Sal-weide “a kind of willow, Salix caprea”, which is of uncertain etymology (cf. Kluge 2002, p. 783), because to be brittle is a characteristic of willows (but not of the Salix caprea who thus must have gotten its denomination by analogy from other types of willows).
Hungarian szilni “to chop, to cut, to plane, to slice” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śale- “to splice, to split” Sumerian sil (119x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. si-il; zil; silx(|EZEN×LAL2|); sil5 “(to be) remote; to split apart; to split, slit”

Hungarian szirt “cliff, ledge, rock”
Sumerian sir, wr. sir5 “(to be) pointed”
Hungarian szív “heart”
Proto-Uralic *śiδä(-mз), *śüδä(-mз) Sumerian sub (126x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. su-ub; sub; sub6 “to suck”. The heart not as “pumping”, but as sucking organ. The PU form with –δ- is solely based on Finn. sydän, Lapp. čāδâ and Mordv. sedej, sedeńg, while all other FU reflexes show –m-, -l- or –j-. Given the Sum. etymology, the Finn., Lapp. and Mordv. words do not belong here and the PU form is thus mistaken.
Hungarian szívni “to suck”
Proto-Altaic *šimi “to suck; to soak” Sumerian sub (126x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. su-ub; sub; sub6 “to suck”. The etymological connection, denied by EWU, p. 1441, is shown clearly not only by our Sum., but also by the PA etymology.
Hungarian szó “word” Proto-Altaic *sāba “sign” Proto-Ugric *sawз Sumerian sa (46x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. sa2 “to advice, to counsel”, or zib (16x: ED IIIb, Ur III) wr. za3; zib “a mark; mark, token; colour, paint”, perhaps a contamination of both words, not unusual in Sum.

Proto-Finno-Ugric *śomз-rз(-) “grief; to be sad” Sumerian sum, wr. sum5 “(to be) poor; pauper”
Hungarian szórni “to scatter, to spread, to sprinkle, to strew” Sumerian šurum, wr. šurumx(|URU×GU|) “to sprinkle oil” Akkadian zarūm
Hungarian szorgalom “diligence, industry, zeal”, szorgalmas “diligent, industrious”
Proto-Ugric *sarз “fast, quick” Sumerian sar (68x: Old Babylonian) wr. sar “to run, hasten”. Semantically, to run in order to be punctually at a certain place, thus “diligent”.
Hungarian szórítani “to force, to urge, to restrict; to hurt, to pinch”, szoros “narrow, tight, dense; mountain pass”, szorulni “to become narrow; to be jammed, to be stuck”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *śorз(-) “tight; to become tight” Sumerian sur (69x: ED IIIb, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. sur; sur8 “to press, squeeze”
Hungarian szőni, szöv- “to weave; to plot, to spin” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śäŋз(-) “to spin, to weave; hair” Sumerian sig (48x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. sig7; sig8 “to pluck hair or wool”, siki (4753x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. siki “wool, fleece; hair; (animal's) pelt” Akkadian šīpātum “wool”. Since the Akk., Rhaet. word with it enlarged root must be a borrowing from Sum., Sum. -g, -k- > Akk., Rhaet. –p- > Hung. –v-, so that the PFU form with its –ŋ- is mistaken (it is strange anyway, since a nasal doesn’t occur in any Uralic word). Moreover, the Hung. word, as the phonetical development shows clearly, must have come from the Rhaetians and not directly from the Sumerians.
Hungarian sző, szőke “blond” Proto-Altaic *šàŋu “clear, light” Proto-Turkic *čaŋ Proto-Mongolic *čaŋ Proto-Tungusic *sā(ŋ) Proto-Ugric *säŋз “bright, clear, light” Sumerian sig (8x: Old Babylonian) wr. si-ig “clear”

Hungarian szökik “to jump, to skip” Chuvash sik- “to skip” Sumerian zig (8574x: Lagash II, Ur III) wr. zig3 “to swell; to rise”, zig, wr. zig “threshold” 2002, p. 833. Semantically, we have “to rise” > “to go out”, which may include the meaning of “threshold” (“to go out” = “to walk over the threshold”). The two Sum. words zig “to go out” and zig “threshold” may even be one and the same, cf. in German Schwelle “threshold” and schwellen “to swell” (connection denied by Kluge 2002, p. 833).

Obviously, the original meaning is “to heap up knowledge” (in Proto-Altaic, there was for sure no word for “to inform”!).
Hungarian tántorogni, tántorodik “to stagger, to sway”

Hungarian tarhonya “granulated dried pastry made of flour and eggs, ‘egg-barley’” Turkish tarhana “a kind of soup made of flour and milk” Sumerian tar (237x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tar; tarar “to cut down; to untie, loosen; to cut; to scatter, disperse; to decide” + kana (3x: Old Babylonian) wr. kana6; kana5; kana3 “(to be) dark”. The Tarhonya dough is traditionally pressed through/cut by a special sieve in order to get the “egg-barleys” (so the American name, derived from Austrian German “Eiergerstel”: Germ. Gerste “barley”). After the tarhonya are dry, they are roasted (“darkened”) in lard. Our etymology thus shows that the pastry is primary and the soup secondary. Therefore, the Hung. word cannot be borrowed (as usually assumed; cf. EWU, p. 1484) from the Turkish word, but the Turkish word is borrowed from the Hung., which explains that the two words are phonetically almost identical. Both words, however, go back to Sumerian.
Hungarian tarja “spare rib” Proto-Finno-Ugric *turja Sumerian dirig (2166x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. diri; RI “(to be) big, huge; on, over, above; to build high”. Same etymology as taraj (v.s.), but with already Sum. metathesis dirig > *dirgi > tarja. The spare rib is taken from the neck part of the animal, thus from there where the “crest” is (cf. German Kamm “crest; spare rib”).
Hungarian tar, tarka “multi-coloured; mottled”
Kazakh tarlan “reddish-yellow or black spotted white (of horses)” Sumerian dara (43x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dara4 “(to be) red; (to be) brown”
Hungarian tarló “stubble-field” Classical Mongolian tari- “to plow the land” Sumerian tar (237x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tar; tarar “to cut; to plow”

Hungarian tat, tatfa “crossrail (in a ship); poop, stern” (fa “tree; wood”) Proto-Uralic *tuktз “crossrail” Sumerian tug (54x: ED IIIb) wr. tugx(LAK483) “a kind of plow?”
Hungarian tathal “tench (Tinca tinca)” (hal “fish”) Proto-Uralic *totke Sumerian tug (54x: ED IIIb) wr. tugx(LAK483) “a kind of plow?”. The tail of the tench has a high stalk with a fin that ends even and thus resembles to the knive of a plow or a crossrail.

Hungarian tavaly “last year”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *to “that” + *oδe, *ōδe “year” Sumerian -da (comitative suffix) + ud (29106x: Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. ud “day; summer”. This etymology is not appropriate first because reflexes of PFU *oδe, *ōδe “year” do not exist otherwise in Hung., since év “year” < PFU *jikä, *ikä, and second because the stem of the word denoting “far, away” is not *to- nor *ta-, but tav-, so tavaly has to be separated in tav-aly and not in tavaly as stated in UEW (p. 335, supported by Komi vo “year” and Udmurt va “life”). Therefore, the etymology proposed here is: tab (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. tab “begin” + ul (161x: ED IIIb, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. ul; ul-li2; ul-li “(to be) distant (in time); distant time”.
Hungarian tavasz “spring” Proto-Finno-Ugric *towkз Sumerian tab (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. tab “begin”
Hungarian távol “far”, tova “away”, túl “beyond” Proto-Uralic *to “that” Sumerian dub (30x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dab6; dub “to go around, encircle, turn; to search; to tarry”. EWU (p. 1537) explains –v- as “Hiatustilger” which is ad hoc; as the Sum. word shows, it belongs to the stem.
Hungarian te “thou, you” Proto-Altaic *si “thou” Proto-Uralic *t8 “you (here)”, *to “you (there)” Sumerian za-e, zé (contracted) “you”
Hungarian tegezni “to shoot with arrows” Proto-Altaic *t’úŋgi- “to quiver” Proto-Ugric *täŋ-tз- “id.” Sumerian tag (266x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. tag “to attack”. The phonetically identical verb Hung. tegezni “to address sb. in the informal way (German: duzen)” and its counterpart magázni “to address sb. in the formal way (Germ.: siezen)” are built of the basis of te “thou” and maga “you (formal)”, whereby the derivational suffix az/-ez is probably formed according to Germ. –z- (du-z-en, sie-z-en, lit. “to say ‘thou’ (to sb.); to say ‘you’ (to sb.)”.
Hungarian tekerni “to twist, to wind”
Sumerian tag (266x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. tag “to bind”
Hungarian tekinteni “to look, to watch; to regard as” Proto-Ugric *täkkз- “to notice, to observe” Sumerian tag (266x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. tag “to touch, take hold of; to bind; to attack”
Hungarian teknő “trough”
Sumerian dug (3196x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. dug; dugx(BI) “(clay) pot; a unit of liquid capacity”

Hungarian temetni “to bury”, temető “cemetery”
Sumerian dim, wr. dim3 “corpse”. EWU (p. 1500) derives temetni from tömni “to stuff” with causative suffix –et, which is semantically senseless. Probably Hung. tetem “corpse” is related to Sum. dim, too.
Hungarian tengely “axle; spindle”
Sumerian dimgal (11x: Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dim-gal; di-im-gu-ul “a pole”
Hungarian tenger “sea” Chagatai täŋiz Turkish deniz Sumerian diĝir (1837x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. diĝir; dim3-me-er; dim3-me8-er; dim3-mi-ir; di-me2-er “deity, god, goddess”. Since Turkish has also tanrı “god” and Mongolian tenger “god”, the semantic development is probably: “god” > “heaven” > “sea”, whereby the connection between “heaven” and “sea” is made by the common blue colour or by the fact that the heaven is mirrored in the sea.
Hungarian tenni, tesz, tev- “to do, to make, to place, to put” Proto-Altaic *t’ebV “to put” Proto-Mongolic *teγeProto-Tungusic *tebProto-Finno-Ugric *teke- “to do, to make” Sumerian tag (266x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. tag “to touch, take hold of; to bind; to attack”

Sumerian dug (3196x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. dug; dugx(BI) “(clay) pot; a unit of liquid capacity”. Same etymology as Hung. tok “box”, cf. semantically the parallele of Hung. tok and tokhal with English sturgeon (via Normannic < Old French esturjon) and to stir from the common Germanic etymon sturio “sturgeon” (> Old English styria).
Hungarian toklyó “one- or two-year old lamb”
Sumerian tukur (8x: Old Babylonian) wr. tukur2; tukur; tukur3 “to shear, pluck wool”. Semantically cf. Engl. sheep, Germ. Schaf to Germ. schaben “to scrape” > “to cut, to trim, to shear”.

Hungarian tor “feast (especially after a funeral and a pig-slaughtering [disznóölés])”
Chagatai tor “dinner with guests, hospitality” Sumerian tar (237x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tar; tarar “to cut down; to untie, loosen; to cut; to scatter, disperse; to decide”.

Hungarian Tóth (Magyar surname)
Sumerian utud (847x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tud; u3-tu; tu-ud “to give birth (to), bear a child”. According to EWU, p. 1535, < Old High German thiot “people” and after used as denonmination for Slavonic people, esp. Slowaks and Slovenians, but mostly in a negative sense, cf. tótosan beszélni “to speak with Slowakian accent”, tótágast állni “to be in a flap”, etc. However, it is hard to believe that a German word would have been used for the Slavonic foreigners in Hungary and especially a word with the general meaning “people”. Therefore, since Tóth originates in Sum. and considering the meaning “people”, which can only mean Hungarians, the Tóth’s must be one of the oldest Hung. tribes. (Our etymology follows Ida Bobula, Kétezer magyar név sumir eredete. Montreal 1970, p. 82.)
Hungarian tő “root; trunk (of a tree)” Proto-Altaic *tèmò “root; strength; soul” Proto-Turkic *damor Proto-Mongolic *taŋ-gi < *dam-gi Sumerian dim (38x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dim; dim3; ĝešdim “post, pillar, pole”

Considering the 3 consonant-root, here we have most probably an Akk.-Rhaet. loanword in Sumerian (which proves, in accordance with Lieberman 1977, p. 20 that Sumerian was still spoke in Old Babylonian time).
Hungarian tölgy “oak”
Sumerian tillug (3x: Old Babylonian) wr. til-lu-ug “elephant”. The semantic connection between “oak” and “elephant” is the hardness of the wood and the teeth, resp., similar to Engl. oak = Germ. Eiche, which are denominated after the word for “ice” (*ajeg-, Kluge 2002, p. 230; cf. Hung. jég).

Hungarian ugar “fallow (field/ground/land)
Sumerian agar (135x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. a-gar3; agar4; agar2; agar3; a-da-ar “meadow” Akkadian ugāru. Since Sum. shows traces of vowel harmony, Sum. agar < Akk., Rhaet. ugāru, so we have here another possible Akk. and Rhaet. borrowing in Sum. and thus another proof that Sum. was still spoken in Old Babylonian time (cf. Lieberman 1977, p. 20). The Akk. and Rhaet. word is also phonetically closer to the Hung. and may be the etymon for ugor “Ugric” > Germ. Ungar, Engl. Hungarian, French Hongrois, Russ.

Hungarian ürge “kind of squirrel that lives in the earth, Spermophilus citellus” Khakass örge, örke Sumerian irgilum (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. ir-gi-lum “locust”. Semantical connection between “squirrel” and “locust” probably via their common habit of eating (locust swarms were infamous). Alternatively to urgir (478x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. ur-gir15 “(domestic) dog”, which causes, however, also semantical problems.
Hungarian üröm “wormwood”
Sumerian hurium, wr. u2hu-ri2-um “a plant”
Hungarian ürü “lamb”
Altai irik “young ram” Kipchak örük “young castrated ram” Turkish irk “id.” Sumerian For Hung. one would prefer urri (3x: Old Babylonian) wr. ur2-ri-a “a designation of sheep”, but the other words seem to belong to kirga, wr. kir11ga “suckling lamb” with loss of the initial consonant. It may, however, also be that the final consonant dropped in Hung. and so all words belong to Sum. kirga.

Proto-Uralic *-l (lative suffix), or *-ki (lative suffix) + *-j “id.”

Hungarian vad “wild; inhabited” Proto-Finno-Ugric *vamta Sumerian bad (3x: Old Babylonian) wr. bad4 “hard ground”. Engl. “bad”, according to traditional etymological dictionaries a “mystery word, no apparent relatives in other languages” is most probably besides Hung. vad the phonetically closest successor of Sum. bad.

Sumerian pana (63x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. ĝešpana; ba-na; ĝešpanax(|ŠE.NUN&NUN|) “bow; a geometric figure”. In order to chop meat one still today best uses a bowshaped knife (Germ.: Wiege-messer, but “wiegen” = “weigh” has nothing to do with cutting; thus perhaps Wiege- < Hung. vág- < Sum. pan-?).
Hungarian vágyik “to desire, to long, to wish, to yearn, to crave” Proto-Finno-Ugric *wačз- “to chase, to drive, to hunt”

Hungarian ványadni “to become scraggy/stunted”, ványolni “to mill; to thrash, to clobber”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *wańз- “to strike” > “to fashion sth. (e.g. leather) by striking it repeatedly with an instrument” Sumerian epana (2x: Old Babylonian) wr. ĝeše2-pan “quiver”

Hungarian vár “fort, fortress”, város “city, town”
Sumerian iri (2070x: ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. iri; iriki; uru2; uru11; iri11 “city”, iri, wr. i-ri “(to be) high”, ir (35x: Old Babylonian) wr. ir9; ir3 “mighty”. Given the Sum. etymology there is thus no reason to believe (EWU, p. 1606) that the Hung. word are borrowing from an Iranian language.

Hungarian varrni “to sew” Proto-Finno-Ugric *workзSumerian bur (1x: Lagash II) wr. tug2bur2 “an item of clothing”. The PFU form with –k that is based solely on Komi õrge-, urge- “to sew” (EWU, p. 1609), is thus mistaken.
Hungarian vásár “market, fair; bargain”, vásárolni “to buy”
Sumerian ba (839x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. ba “to divide into shares, share, halve; to allot” + sa (991x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. sa10 “to pay for, buy; to be paid for, sell”

Hungarian veréb “sparrow”
Sumerian buru (30x: ED IIIa, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. buru5mušen “bird(s), small birds, sparrow; flock of birds”. Engl. sparrow, Germ. Sper-ling < ProtoGermanic *sparwan < PIE *sper-, but since this may be one of the several cases with prosthetic s-, PIE *(s)per- probably < Sum. buru.
Hungarian verem “cave, den, hole, pit”
Sumerian bur (85x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. bur; na4bur “bowl”, burud (49x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. burudx(U) “breach, hole; depression, low-lying area, depth; to perforate; (to be) deep”
Hungarian vért “armour, cuirass”

Hungarian vese “kidney” Proto-Ugric *w8ćз “penis” Sumerian ĝeš (47x: Old Babylonian) wr. ĝeš3; mu “penis; male” Akkadian išaru. Since the Akk. and Rhaet. word are borrowings form the Sum. word, Akk. Rhaet. išaru < *viśaru (still conserved in the name of the Akk.-Rhaet. death-ghost Rhaet. Vitammu, Akk. Itammu, Etemmu, cf. Brunner and Tóth 1987, p. 61) with initial v- still conserved in Hung. vese. Therefore, the Hung. cannot originate directly in the Sum., but in the Akk., Rhaet. word.
Hungarian vésni “to chisel, to cut” Proto-Finn-Ugric *wäńgćз(-) “to cut; knife” Sumerian peš, wr. peš6 “to slice” Akkadian paşādu
Hungarian vészni “to get lost”, veszteni “to lose”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *wočз- “to be lost”, *wäsз- “to disappear, to get lost” Sumerian uš (3556x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. uš2 “to die; to be dead; to kill; death”
Hungarian vessző “rod, twig, verge”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *waćз “narrow, thin bent branch” Sumerian ĝeš (5552x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. ĝeš; mu; u5 “tree; wood” Akkadian işu < *wişu (cf. s.v. vese)

Hungarian vézna “thin, slight” Proto-Finno-Volgaic *wäćkз “narrow, thin” Proto-Ugric *wäńćз, *wäćз “narrow, thin” Sumerian sig (343x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian, 1st millennium) wr. sig “(to be) weak; (to be) low; (to be) thin; (to be) narrow”, gig (313x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. gig “to be) sick”
Hungarian vigyázni “to pay attention, to beware, to look out” Proto-Finno-Ugric *wića- “to notice, to see” Sumerian igi sig (8x: Old Babylonian) wr. igi sig10 “to see”
Hungarian világ “light; world”, villám “lightening”, villanni “to flash, to sparkle, to twinkle”, villogni “to sparkle, to twinkle”,
Proto-Finno-Ugric *walkз(-) “light, white; to light”, *wal’з- “to shine” Sumerian bil (50x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. bil2; bil3; bil “to burn”
Hungarian virág “flower”, virítani “to bloom”, virradni “to dawn”, virrasztani “to stay awake”
Sumerian bur (78x: ED IIIa, Old Akkadian, Ur III) wr. bur2; bu7 “light; to glow, shine”. According to EWU (pp. 1640ss.), the word-families vir- and vil- (cf. világ) belong together (but not the family virr-). The Sum. word bur, however, shows that this is not correct, the dark stem vowel u is even apparent in the ending ani instead of –eni in virítani as well as in virradni instead of *virredni. Akkadian arāqum “to bloom” < *warāqum, but unlike in the case of Hung. vese (s.v.), *w- < b-, not < g-.
Hungarian vinni, visz- “to carry, to bring, to take” Proto-Finno-Ugric *wiγeSumerian gaĝ (538x: Ur III) wr. gaĝx(IL2); ga-aĝ3 “to carry”. Same etymology as venni (s.v.).
Hungarian vívni “to fight”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *woje- “to be able to” Sumerian u (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. u8; u2 “defeat”
Hungarian víz “water” Proto-Uralic *wete Sumerian biz (12x: Old Babylonian) wr. bi-iz; biz “to trickle, drip” Akkadian başāşum (< Sum. biz). In this case, we can say from the palatal stem vowel both in Hung. víz (acc. vizet, not *vizot or *vizat) and Sum. biz that this word originates directly in Sum. and not in the Sum. borrowing Akk., Rhaet. başāşum, which shows a velar stem-vowel. Also PIE *wodor/*wedor/ *uder-, from root *wed- (cf. Hittite watar, Sanskrit udnah, Greek hydor, Old Bulgarian, Russian voda, Lithuanian vanduo, Old Prussian. wundan, Gaelic uisge “water”, Latin unda “wave” originate in Sum. biz and thus also genetically related to Hung. víz.

Hungarian vő, vej- “son-in-law”
Proto-Uralic *wäŋз “bridegroom, stepson” Sumerian pap (86x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. pap “father; male, virile; brother” Akkadian abu “father”. Hung. vő comes not directly from Sum. pap, but from the Sum. borrowing in Akk., Rhaet. abu, the meaning of which is, however, “father” and not “son-in-law”. The reason may be, that a related word, Sum. abba > Hung. apa “father”, so Sum. abu got its special meaning of a more distant male relative.
Hungarian vöcsök “crested grebe (a kind of duck, family of Podicipedidae)”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *wajćз “a kind of duck”
Sumerian uz (57x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. uz; uzmušen “wild duck” Akkadian ūsu

Hungarian -z (denominative verb suffix, e.g. neve-z- “to name, to call”, név, neve“name”)

Hungarian zaj “noise”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *śoje(-) “audible sound; to make noise, to sound” Proto-Ugric *soj8(-) “id.” Sumerian šeg (28x: Old Babylonian) wr. še; šeg10; šegx(|KA×KID2|); šegx(|KA×LI|); šed15; šeg12 “voice, cry, noise”
