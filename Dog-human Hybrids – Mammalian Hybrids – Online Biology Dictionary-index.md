Dog-human Hybrids
Mammalian Hybrids
EUGENE M. MCCARTHY, PHD GENETICS, ΦΒΚ
If a woman gives birth to a child with a dogʼs head, the city will be in distress, and evil will be in the country.
From ancient times right up
to the present, dog-human
hybrids of sexual origin have
been repeatedly reported,
often by eyewitnesses. This
page attempts to collect
those reports in one place.
Hybrids involving non
human primates and dogs
are covered on a separate
page.
The various discussions of
hybrids on this site attempt
to include all relevant reports
that have been encountered,
at least those made by
serious people, especially by
scholars. This policy of
listing all such reports has
been set with the intention
of avoiding a systematic
reporting bias. The same is



done here with respect to allegations of hybridization between
human beings and dogs. But given the deep history of this cross, it
seems appropriate to provide a bit of background information before
turning to the actual reports.
Background
Cynocephaly, the condition of a human having the head of a dog, is
described in the writings of many different cultures, both ancient and
recent. As myth, there is an extensive literature on dog-human
hybrids. For millennia, authors from China to Greece have written of
these creatures, the Cynocephali, strange beings who usually
preferred to occupy the gray, unknown regions of the map.
In medieval and ancient times, it was widely believed that entire
races of dog-headed men existed (for example, see the extracts
from Ctesias and Marco Polo below). Writing in the early fifth century
A.D. (City of God, 16\8), St. Augustine expresses his puzzlement on
the topic: “What shall I say of the Cynocephali, whose dog-like head
and barking proclaim them beasts rather than men?” Pliny the Elder
(Natural History, 7.2) reported that in the mountains of India “there is
a tribe of men who have
the heads of dogs, and clothe themselves with the skins of wild
beasts. Instead of speaking, they bark; and, furnished with claws,
they live by hunting and catching birds.
In Eastern Orthodox iconography, another saint, St. Christopher, was
often represented as having the head of a dog (see image below). It
seems that many medieval scholars were more concerned with how
such creatures should be classified than with whether they actually
existed. Thus, in a letter, the Benedictine monk Ratramnus of Corbie
(Epistola de Cynocephalis ad Rimbertum presbyterum scripta, 1153),
who lived in the ninth century, wrote



So you would like to know what you should believe about the
Cynocephali, whether you should deem them descendants of Adam,
or count them as mere animals? [Translated by E.M. McCarthy.
Original Latin.]

In Eastern Orthodox iconography, St. Christopher was often depicted
as a dog-human hybrid.

An early asiatic representation of cynocephali (Zakariya al-Qazwini,
Marvels of Things Created and Miraculous Aspects of Things
Existing, 13th century).
The Egyptians worshiped
various dog-headed gods,
including the major deity
Anubis (pictured at right). In
Mesopotamia, the Sumerians
revered the goddess Bau, who,
under the name of Nininsina,
was long represented with a
dogʼs head. And in some parts
of the world, such beliefs linger
even today. For example,
effigies of dog-headed men
still stand duty as temple
demons in the wats of
Thailand.



Many traditions exist, too, about women being ravished by dogs.
Thus, in the Dhammapada (Verse 151), the Buddha utters the
following about Queen Mallika, wife of King Prasenajit (Bullough
1976):
One day, Queen Mallika went in to bathe, and her pet dog came with
her. And as she was bending to cleanse her feet, he mounted her,
and she was not displeased. But the king observed this through the
window. And when she came in, he cried, “O! Wicked woman! What
did you there with that dog? Do not deny those things I saw with my
own eyes!” The queen replied that she was only bathing, and
therefore had transgressed not. Then she said, “But that chamber is
most odd. To those looking in from the window, anyone alone there
seems two. If you believe me not, O King, I entreat you go into that
chamber that I might look upon you through the window.”
So, the king did enter there. And when he came forth, Mallika asked
why he had been transgressing there with a she-goat. He denied it,
but she insisted she had seen him with her own eyes. The king was
baffled, but gullible as he was, he agreed that that chamber was
most peculiar indeed.
Moreover, in certain cultures human beings sometimes actually
marry dogs. For example, the case shown in the video below, in
which the parents of a Hindu girl arranged for her to marry a stray
dog.

INDIAN GIRL MARRIED WITH DOG
An Inuit story tells of a woman who marries a dog and has hybrid
offspring, called Adlets in the Inuit tongue (see quoted story below).
Similarly, in their book The Mythology of Dogs (1997), Hausman and
Hausman write about the reverence of the Ainu people of northern
Japan for dogs: “The word ‘Ainuʼ in Japanese means ‘sons of dogs.ʼ
The respect accorded to these animals comes from a legend that
states that Ainus are people descended from the union of a dog and
a woman.” Nansen (1893, 272) notes “Analogous myths of
descent from dogs (or wolves, or bears) occur among many races,
Aryan as well as Mongolian or American. They lie at the root of the
mythology of many Indian tribes, who hold that the first woman took
a dog to mate, and that they themselves are descended from this
connection.
In his Myths of the Dog-man (1991, p. 137) David Gordon White,



A cynocephalic dog-human hybrid gargoyle (Moulins Cathedral, France)
comments that “Perhaps by
virtue of a Mongol influence,
the lupine ancestry myth is one
that is widespread among the
peoples of central Asia; but so
too is the canine ancestry
myth. Whether the latter is a
variant of the former or an
independent tradition that has
become conflated with the
former, as in the Mongol
tradition, is an insoluble
problem.
And then, there are those
reports that are non-fictional,
at least in tone, but so ancient that they, too, verge on myth. One
such is that of Phlegon of Trailles (Hansen translation, 1996), the
second-century Roman writer, who mentions that “The wife of
Cornelius Gallicanus gave birth near Rome to a child having the head
of Anubis”, that is, the head of a dog.
But here the focus will be on serious allegations made in relatively
recent times, of humans (or other primates) crossing with dogs. As
one might expect, given the taboo nature of the subject, such claims
by scientists, physicians and scholars are fairly rare. But they are not
nonexistent.
Reports in Medical Journals
A search of the formal literature has revealed relatively few accounts
of dog-human hybrids, but some do exist in older medical journals,
all involving human mothers. (If you know of other such reports,



please communicate the relevant information through the contact
page of this website.)
New Jersey. One such communication appeared in the Transactions
of the Medical Society of New Jersey (1889, p. 197):
A Birthmark
By John W. Wade, Jr., M.D.
In this city [i.e., Millville, New Jersey], February 3, 1886, Mrs. C., after
several “false alarms,” gave birth to a singular specimen of humanity
in the shape of a well-developed male child with a dogʼs head. The
head lacks the occipital bone, and the two parietal bones are long
and narrow, diverging towards the base of the skull, making the head
flat on top. The brain is atrophied, and is exposed at the cerebellum
[a case of anencephaly and/or spina bifida?]. There is no neck nor
chin. The mouth is very large, the tongue long, and the nose reaches
from the top of the forehead to within half an inch of the upper lip.
The eyes bulge out like those of a frog. The ears resemble those of a
dog, cropped.
When born, it had been dead only about four minutes. The tongue
protruded from the mouth. The head was drawn out to a point, thus
bringing the eyes, nose and mouth, close together, making it
resemble very much the head of a pug dog. Since its birth it has
changed somewhat in appearance. The color of the head has
changed from a black to a copper color; the face has become more
rounded: it has also become wrinkled.
Ottawa, Illinois. This report appeared in the Atlanta Medical and
Surgical Journal (1885, vol. 25, p. 126):
A Case of Monstrosity



A Child with a Dogʼs Head
Dr. C. Hard of Ottawa, Ill., reports the following case: A German
woman was delivered of a very large female child, weighing fourteen
and a half pounds. The body was well formed and perfect but the
head was almost the exact counterpart of a bull pup, and was the
most hideous monstrosity I ever saw. The eyes were high up on the
forehead, large and round, and protuberant, and were two and a half
inches apart; no eyebrows. The nose was long and flat, and
continued to the mouth, with wide open nostrils; the distance from
forehead to nose and mouth 3 1/2 inches. The ears were small and
long, standing out from the sides of the head one inch, and looked
like the cropped ears of a stable dog; they were 3 1/2 inches apart.
Back of the ears was a single tuft of coarse reddish hair, about one
inch long. There was no back part to the head; or rather, no bones,
but a simple sac containing a soft, semi-fluid mass [a probable case
of anencephaly and/or spina bifida?]. Taking the whole face together,
the resemblance to a dog was most striking, and was at once
remarked upon by all present, some of whom were anxious that I
should dispatch it at once, but I allayed their fears by assuring them
that the child would not live. It did live four hours, giving out faint
moans from time to time.
Franklin, Wisconsin. Another report is from the Northwestern
Medical and Surgical Journal (1848, vol. 1, p. 455):
Monster with a Head Resembling a Dogʼs
P. J. Hamilton, M.D., of Franklin, Wis., in a communication relates the
following:
On the 9th inst., I was called to see Mrs. R___, whom I found in labor
with her fifth child. The pains were very strong when I arrived. The



waters were discharged in a short time. I made an examination, and
was at a loss to determine the presentation. The pains being strong, I
was not long kept in suspense. A child was born with a dogʼs head. In
every other respect, it was perfect. The cerebellum and part of the
cerebrum were covered with their proper membrane; the dura mater
[a probable case of anencephaly and/or spina bifida?]. A
cartilaginous substance formed part of the os frontis. The ears were
long, and lopped down, like a dogʼs. The eyes were very large, and in
every respect resembled a dogʼs.
Kansas City, Kansas. Another report about the birth of a dog
headed child appeared in the professional journal Medical Arena
(May 1897, vol. 6(5), p. 148):
A MONSTROSITY
CHAS. H. ST. JOHN, PH.B., M.D., KANSAS CITY, KAS.
Mrs. K_____, a primipara, was delivered of a monstrosity in the month
of March, 1897. It had the face of a pug dog without any
development of the head and brain [this seems to be a reference to
anencephaly], with an imperfect right foot with five toes, being much
the shape of a dogʼs foot. The period of labor was over twenty hours.
There was an abnormal amount of fluid present. The sack had to be
punctured twice before the liquor amnii [i.e., amniotic fluid] escaped
sufficiently to permit the birth of the child. Vertex presentation,
“minus vertex,” [i.e., headfirst, but lacking the top of the head, a
probable case of anencephaly] sex female; perfectly developed, with
the above exceptions; weight about six pounds; breathed but once
after delivery as far as noted by the obstetrician.
During the period of gestation there were no abnormal disturbances,
except some slight evidences of ascitic conditions. No albuminuria.
Patient recovered rapidly, considering the shock resulting from the



protracted labor and the intense mental disturbance. The brief
statement was made by Mrs. K_____ that during the early months of
pregnancy, when a number of personal friends were present, a
conversation took place in which a number of stories were told about
dogs. Mrs. K. became very nervous and requested a change of
conversation, but at the same time she experienced a peculiar and
unnatural warm glow, which seemed to influence her whole body.
This resulted in a highly nervous condition that remained for many
hours thereafter and impressed her that her unborn child was
marked by reason of the peculiar influence that had possessed her. It
seemed almost impossible to throw it off. The face of the child was a
most perfect picture of the face of the pug dog that was and is now
a pet of the household.
Sexual contact. With regard to the simple act of mating, itʼs well known that male dogs are extremely promiscuous with respect to choice of mate (as is documented elsewhere on this website). They have been observed in coitu with a wide variety of animals, including not only various primates, but even birds, for example, with chickens and geese. Moreover, scholarly studies of human behavior report the occurrence of sexual relations between dogs and human beings, primarily women, from early times right up to the present (Miletski 2009). Such practices have been documented across a broad range of cultures, ranging from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, to India and Japan and certain Native American cultures, and even to modern America and Europe (ibid). It is on account of this tendency, for example, that the Talmud forbids widows to keep dogs (See: Abodah Zarah 22b). Sexual relations between women and dogs are mentioned, too, in ancient Akkadian omen lists (Freedman 2017, p. 59).
Georgia. Another doctorʼs report, from a physiciansʼ round-table
discussion of monstrosities, appeared in the Weekly Medical Review
(1884, vol. 9, p. 454). The relevant passage, which appears below, is
an excerpt from the comments of one of the participants, one Dr.



Dickinson, who gives a description of a supposed dog-headed child
born in Georgia. Dickinson says, “I saw some months ago a
publication in the papers in regard to a child in Georgia that had a
dogʼs head. The name of the physician was given, and I wrote to him
out of curiosity to know what he had to say about it. He replied as
follows:
Dear Doctor—In regard to the account you speak of, I must say it is a
great wonder indeed, but as to its being part dog and part man, I
donʼt know what to say to you. I will just give you a short account of
the case and let you judge. The child is from an unmarried woman,
her first, a male child. It presented pedalic extremities first, and
flexed upon themselves, and with a good effort I succeeded with
great difficulty to deliver, and when I delivered it, I found it perfect
male up to the head and face. It has no mouth, no chin, and just
where the mouth and chin ought to be, there is a something
extending out like a dog or fox, or something of that kind, and its
ears are down, under its jaws, or where its jaws ought to be, on its
neck. Its eyes are not square across as usual, but diagonal ranging
from outwards and upwards at an angle of about 45 degrees. The
nose rested upon this, the human nose, and in the center of this
strange nose or proboscis, is a little round opening about as large as
a knitting needle. Now to elevate the face or head, and look it in the
face, it does not look like a human. and has some appearance of an
animal, favoring a fox about as much as the dog, but the features are
not that of a perfect dog. I must say I never saw anything like unto it
in all my days. It is one of the great wonders of the age. I asked the
mother if she got alarmed at a dog or anything. She said no. I cannot
learn who or what was its father, as she is not very communicative
upon that subject.
Another medical report
A similar, but less explicit account appeared in the



Transactions of the Michigan Medical Society (1873, vol. 6, p. 402). In describing an anomalous birth, the attending physician, Dr. E. P. Christian of Wyandotte, Michigan, says, “Altogether a very odd and monstrous appearance was presented, realizing in aspect what is popularly described as a dog-headed child” (source.)
English Law
In the present context, itʼs interesting that some English legal texts dealing with inheritance refer specifically to dog-headed humans. For example, Hawkins (1751, p. 11) states that "None born out of lawful Wedlock can be an Heir. Nor a Monster, i.e., one wanting Human Shape, as having a Dogʼs Head, but one having Fingers or Toes too many or too few, or Limbs distorted, is no Monster."
In the first three cases above, the physician making the report goes
on to attribute the unusual appearance of the infant to various
disturbing experiences that the mother had with dogs while
pregnant. And in the case reported from Georgia, the attending
doctor tried to do the same, though the mother provided him with no
basis for doing so. Up until the early twentieth century, doctors often
attributed birth defects to emotional experiences undergone by
mothers during pregnancy. Often the specific form of the defect was
thought of as the effect of a particular type of experience. Thus, in
the cases quoted here, the attending physicians thought that the
babies had dogʼs heads because the mothers had mentally striking
experiences involving dogs. Such effects were termed “maternal
impressions.”
And another brief medical mention of such a hybrid appeared in the
Lancet (Jul. 4, 1863, p. 27). It reads “A child born with mouth and
upper and lower extremities resembling those of a dog.”
News reports



No other reports of a dog crossing with a human being have been
found in any formal journal within the last two centuries. There are,
however, various news reports about such creatures. Some are mere
allegations mailed in by readers, such as the following message from
reader “X.D.” printed in the Ann Landers column of the Chicago
Tribune on 10/9/1987:
Dear Ann Landers: My grandma was a midwife. She delivered a baby
with the head of a Great Dane. It lived two hours and was buried
secretly.
X.D.
North Carolina. But others are actual reports by journalists. Thus,
the following appeared in The Roanoke News (Mar. 17, 1892, p. 1, col.
3), a newspaper published in Weldon, North Carolina. The story
originated with the Durham, North Carolina, Sun.
FOR MEDICAL EXPERTS
A CHILD BORN WITH A NATURAL HEAD BUT A BODY HAVING
THE APPEARANCE OF A DOG
Durham Sun
A child was born in Durham this morning the mother being a
colored woman, and it is exciting the curiosity of some of our
physicians. A Sun reporter saw it this morning and it beats
anything in the way of a freak of nature he ever beheld. The head
was a perfect formation of a human being, with the exception that it
had rudimentary ears, no chin from the mouth and the jaws
extending backwards as in the formation of a dog. It was pronounced
to be eight months old and was born dead.[?] There was a thick
head of long black hair extending down the neck to the body.



Under the microscope the body showed that it was covered with a
hairy fuzz and at the end [of the] spinal column there was a well
defined tail one-fourth of an inch long. The body was peculiarly
shaped, not exactly resembling a human being. There were no arms,
but something in the shape of hands or paws, growing from the skin,
with no bones. The body, adjoining the legs, was very peculiarly
shaped. There were no ankles. The feet projected from the knee
joint.
The formation and appearance of the body was a very peculiar
one and the physicians who saw it expressed various opinions, yet all
agreed they never saw anything like it before. The body was
photographed and then placed in alcohol for preservation.
New Mexico. Another such event, this time in New Mexico, was
reported that same year. The report appeared in various American
newspapers, but the following transcript is taken from the Fort
Worth Gazette (Feb. 4, 1892, p. 1 , col. 4).
A Dog-Child
Raton, N. M., Jan. 27—The wife of a half-breed Indian living near
Raton on the line of the Santa Fe railroad gave birth to a child a few
days ago that is attracting much attention and exciting great
curiosity. The legs of the child are exactly like the legs of a dog—in
fact the entire lower part of the body is the body of a dog. The flanks
are joined together and the legs and hips are covered with a thick
yellow skin. The feet have five toes, but the nails are shaped like the
nails of a dog, and under the foot there is a cushion such as a dog
has. The child was ten days old before anyone knew anything about
it, and then a man who happened to stop at the house discovered it.
the father and mother are poor and illiterate and donʼt seem to care
very much, in fact as the freak has been the means of bringing them
quite a little money, they probably have very little regret. It makes a



noise that sounds more like the whine of a pup than the cry of a
baby. The head and arms were well formed and looked perfectly
natural. The legs and feet were then shown. The legs were close to
the body doubled up as a dog doubles up his legs when sitting on
his haunches. The father says that six months before the birth of the
child the mother had been attacked by a large shepherd dog and
badly bitten. The fright threw her into convulsions and for three or
four months afterwards she continued to have spells and she would
fall down and, frothing at the mouth, bark like a dog and scratch at
the floor with her hands and feet. For a few weeks before the birth of
the child, however, she had appeared to be much better and had not
suffered from an attack.
Thus, again, in this case a “maternal impression,” and not
hybridization between a human and a dog, is offered as an
explanation of the childʼs doglike features.
The case just quoted is of interest, because it mimics four other
reports in which women supposedly gave birth to composite
creatures, like a human child from the navel up, but from there down,
like a dog, one at Beaver Dam, Wisconsin in 1873, one at Dechard,
Tennessee in 1865, one at Leitmeritz, Bohemia in 1615, and another
at Rome in 1493 (these cases are described below).

Francken the Younger (1581-1642).
South Dakota. The next report is from the Mitchell Capital (Jul. 30,
1897, p. 1, cols. 3-4), a newspaper published in Mitchell, South
Dakota. The story originated with the Watertown Public Opinion, a
newspaper published in Watertown, South Dakota.
A Freak of Nature
Watertown Public Opinion: Public Opinion secures this piece of
information from sources that warrant the vouching for its accuracy,
although names are suppressed for obvious reasons: There reside in
the reservation country, northwest of Watertown, among others, a
man and wife who command the respect of their neighbors. Recently
the woman in question gave birth to a child whose face and general
features were those of a dog. Its ears were likewise shaped like a
dogʼs, while its hands were more like claws than like hands. Its crying
was an imitation of the bark of a dog. Otherwise the child was
properly formed. It survived but a comparatively short time. Our
informant says that the woman was frightened on account of a dog



fight several months ago, and this incident is presumed to have
wrought the deformity of her child.
Missouri. Another such report appeared in the St. Louis Post
Dispatch (Mar. 25, 1881, p. 4):
Birth of an Infant with a Dogʼs Head and Feet
The astounding rumor that a baby, half human and half dog, had
been born in the neighborhood of Eighteenth and Morgan streets
this morning was current upon ‘Change, and was regarded as an
absurd hoax. A reporter, however, went out to the place indicated,
and after a great many inquiries was directed to an old two-story
frame house, which had evidently seen better days, which is situated
on Orange Alley, the thoroughfare running east and west between
Franklin Avenue and Nineteenth Street. A trip was made up the
shakiest flight of stairs which it has entered the human mind to
conceive, and being careful of the weak places on a porch, the
reporter at last secured admittance to a room which served as
bedroom, parlor, kitchen and dining-room for a small, but interesting
family of African fellow-citizens. A large negro woman, was lying on
the bed with a weight of bed-clothing upon her. She is what used to
be called a “likely” woman, weighing close to 200 pounds, and
displaying an undraped arm of which a coal-heaver or a blacksmith
might have been proud. “Iʼm looking for Samantha Willis.”
“Thatʼs my name,” said the lady in the bed turning away from the
wall and grinning at the scribe.
“I understand that you have had a child?”
“Huh! Huh! I done hab free of um [three of them]. Nʼf [And if the]
ole man doan keepʼs mouf [doesnʼt keep his mouth] shut, Iʼll des turn
to an hab free or foʼ moʼ! [ Iʼll just turn to and have three or four
more]”
At this sable sally, the colored ladies and gentlemen about the bed



laughed uproariously. Samantha looked to the reporter for more
conversation.
“Yes, I heard that,” said he, “but they said that one of them had a
queer head!”
“Well, gimme a dime, boss, ‘n Iʼll show you the chile; it is queer for
shoʼ.”
The dime changed hands, the coverlet was thrown down, and a
little ebony cherub about eight inches long was fished out of the
intricacies of the bedding. He was clothed like Lady Godiva in the
legend of Coventry, simply with purity, and at first glance there was
little to distinguish him from the average African infant. A close
inspection showed, however, that his head was exactly like that of a
dog. It was covered with fur rather than wool, and the facial contour
was just that of a young bull pupʼs. The nose and mouth projected
almost an inch from the balance of the countenance, and the ears
are long, pendulous and like a spanielʼs. It has the power of moving
its ears, which it does continuously, and is apparently a strong,
healthy child, although Dr. Carstairs says it cannot live. The whole
body is covered with very fine and short hair almost like the down on
a peach, it is so soft and so almost imperceptible. The hands are all
right, but the feet are malformed, there being a very perceptible
dew-claw on the left ankle, and the whole foot is that of a dogʼs. The
right foot is amorphous, simply being a piece of flesh not
differentiated into toes. [(The incidence of stump limbs seems to be
elevated in distant hybrids.)] The other two children have none of the
marks of the dog upon them except their ears, which are pendulous
like their brotherʼs, and their bodies are covered with the same
downy fur. Mrs. Willis was attacked by a savage dog about three
months ago and badly bitten in the side, and Dr. Carstairs traces the
lusus naturae to that cause. He thinks two of the children will live,
but that the one who is most strongly marked with canine
characteristics will die.



Iowa. The following case, which supposedly occurred in Iowa in the
following year, was similar to the preceding one, but the report is
brief. It appeared in the Omaha Daily Bee (Apr. 18, 1882, p. 7, col. 5),
a newspaper published in Omaha, Nebraska:
A woman at Ottumwa [Iowa], last week, gave birth to five children,
part human and part dog. The freak of nature is the subject of much
wonderment and comment.
New York. The following story appeared in the New York Sun (Sep.
23, 1888, p. 12, col. 4):
A Dog-faced Girl
In a lonely cabin on the banks of Otselic Creek [todayʼs Otselic
River], in the town of Willet, Cortland County, may be found a
remarkable freak of nature, known throughout the country
roundabout as the “dog-faced girl.” Here mother and daughter,
named respectively Orilla and Sarah Walls, live alone and in poverty,
gaining a precarious support by picking berries and gathering roots
and herbs, and from gifts at the hands of the numerous visitors
whom curiosity brings to their hut.
The peculiarity of the dog-faced girlʼs features lies in the chin,
mouth and nose, which protrude from the head and neck to such an
excessive and unnatural degree, and in a shape strikingly like a dogʼs
snout or muzzle. Otherwise she is well formed and fully developed
for a girl of fifteen years and is notably robust and active. But she is
weak-minded, and the wonderful thing about her imbecility is its
canine characteristic in voice and movement.
Up to about ten years old the girl persisted in running about on all
fours and in this posture she could outrun any child of her age. Her
vocal utterances, also, were marvelously like the barking or howling
of a dog. As she approached the period of womanhood she learned



to walk erect, and her voice lost something of its canine tone, but her
features and utterances are still so unmistakably dog-like as to
attract marked attention and wonder.
She has a constant stream of visitors, including physicians and
scientists as well as ordinary curiosity mongers, and these are told
truthfully that her father who died shortly after her birth, was in no
way malformed or peculiar. Her mother is good looking in feature and
figure, and ordinarily intelligent. None of the dog-faced girlʼs visitors
have as yet suggested any plausible theory of the freak that gave her
to the world.
Another story about Sarah Walls, quoted below, provides some
additional details. It was taken from the Chenango American (Sep.
27, 1888, p. 3, col. 3), a newspaper published in Greene, New York.
A Female Curiosity
One of the most peculiar freaks of nature that has been produced
in any country lives with her mother in a small cabin near the banks
of Bragg Pond,* about four miles from Willett, Cortland County. It is a
girl about fifteen years of age named Sarah Walls, the daughter of a
woman whom the denizens of the locality call “Rilla,” but whose full
name is said to be Orilla Walls.
The girl excites much curiosity among strangers who happen to
meet her in their fishing excursions, because of protruding lower
features. Her mouth, nose and chin seems to be merged into the
form of a dogʼs snout, from which she has gained the sobriquet,
“The dog-faced girl,” and is rarely spoken of otherwise. Her laugh
consists of a series of short yelps; her speech is almost
unintelligible, while intellect is little above that of an idiot.
This lusus Naturae is said to have outgrown many of her canine
instincts but sufficient yet remain to make her a veritable curiosity.
When still a child she often amused herself by barking, and running



on all fours through the woods. It was her delight to sniff at decayed
stumps and with her hands tear away the soft wood in search of
mice and chipmunks. Her speed through the brush is marvelous,
requiring the best efforts of a man to keep her in sight.
She and her mother eke out a scanty living by fishing and picking
berries. The mother is now about fifty years old. Though very
illiterate, she is social and good-natured, and does not appear to
think there is anything remarkable in her offspring. The girl is of
medium size, well developed, and save for her dog-like face would
be considered attractive. —Binghamton Republican, Sept. 15.
* The Comprehensive Plan for the Town of Smithville, Chenango
County, New York states that Bragg Pond was the former name of
Echo Lake, which does in fact lie four miles south of the town of
Willet, which is in Cortland County. Chenango County borders
Cortland County on the south.
The case of Sarah Walls, with her dog snout, is reminiscent of a
much earlier case in which a child with the snout of a pig was
reported as having been born in Eisleben, Germany in 1669.
Similarly, in 1857, in the Australian state of Victoria, a child with the
upper bill of a duck was supposedly born in the town of Kilmore.
Another such case is that of Eugène Boudou, Lʼhomme à la Tête de
Veau, who, according to photographic evidence, also had a mouth
like that of an animal.
Illinois. The next article is from the Dodge City Times (Aug. 8, 1890,
p. 1, col. 1), a newspaper published in Dodge City, Kansas:
A Baby With a Dogʼs Head
Cairo, Ill., Aug. 4.—A lady named McLaughlin, residing on Twenty
first street, this city, recently gave birth to a child whose face and
head was the image of a bulldog, the rest of the monstrosity



retaining the normal condition and appearance of a healthy child.
Sometime past the father of the child purchased a large bulldog,
whose care he entrusted to the wife. About ten days ago the dog
became vicious and frightened the woman so much so that she took
to her bed. Yesterday the monstrosity was born. The child died a few
hours after birth.
A brief notice of the same event appeared in the Daily Tobacco Leaf
Chronicle (Aug. 2, 1890, p. 2, col. 3), a newspaper published in
Clarksville, Tennessee: “A child with a well formed dogʼs head was
born at Cairo Wednesday. It lived several hours.”
Tennessee. Another such report appeared that same year in the
Asheville, North Carolina, Daily Citizen (Jul. 30, 1890, p. 1, col. 6):
In an old sack near a house which has been unoccupied for
months a Memphis [Tennessee] policeman found a monstrosity in
the shape of an animal with the face of a man and the head of a dog.
It had been tenderly wrapped in linen and weighed about five
pounds.
Another Tennessee birth was reported in the Cleveland, Ohio, Daily
Leader (Oct. 25, 1865, p. 2, col. 1):
REMARKABLE MONSTROSITY
A Wonderful Nondescript Found at Dechard, Tennessee
On Tuesday morning, about seven oʼclock, a wonderful
nondescript was found lying on the top of a wood pile in the rear of
the hotel at Dechard. The thing was in appearance, half human and
half canine. The upper half of the phenonmenon resembled the body
and head of an infant a few days old. With the exception of the face
and hands, this portion was covered with light curly hair, which, on



top of the head, was fully two inches long. The hands and face were
entirely exempt from hair, and were, in every way similar to an
infantʼs. The lower half of this wonder corresponded exactly with the
hind quarters of a dog, including a tail about twelve inches long, and
covered with curly hair, similar to that on the head of the prodigy. It
was alive when found, and was regarded by the inhabitants with
mingled wonder and horror. They were undecided whether it were
not the holier work to burn the marvel in the flames. It was finally
taken possession of by two army surgeons, who were stationed in
the town.
The case just quoted parallels four other cases involving hybrids like
a human child from the navel up, but from there down, like a dog,
one at Beaver Dam, Wisconsin in 1873, one at Raton, New Mexico in
1892, one at Leitmeritz, Bohemia in 1615, and another at Rome in
1493.
Oregon. Another, very brief, notice reporting a separate event
appeared in the Lebanon, Oregon, Express (Aug. 10, 1894, p. 3, col.
1): “A child was recently born in Albin‡a with the head of a dog.”
‡ Albina was a historical American city that was consolidated into
Portland, Oregon in 1891.
Ohio. An additional single-sentence report was published in the
Bossier Banner (Jul. 27, 1867, p. 4, col. 2), a newspaper published in
Bellevue, Louisiana: “A special to the Cincinnati Commercial says
that on the 26th inst. ‘A child was born in Milwaukee with a perfect
dogʼs head.ʼ”
The following report is from the Miami Union (Apr. 17, 1880). a
newspaper published in Troy, Ohio:
REMARKABLE MONSTROSITY



Dr. John G. Senour1855-1904
A Child Born With the Head and Face of a Bulldog
Mr. C. F. Grosvenor, Troy correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette
sends the following to his paper of the 14th inst. It is a good
description of one of the most remarkable monstrosities on record.
Troy, O., April 13.—A singular and
somewhat horrible case of the birth of a
monstrosity occurred at or near Nashville,
[an unincorporated place] in
[southwestern] Miami County [Ohio], last
Friday, April 9. Dr. John G. Senour, of Troy,
was called to attend a lady in child birth,
and the result was a stillborn monster — a
male child having a face resembling a
bulldog, but otherwise fully developed. It
seems that the mother at the period of two
months gestation had received a fright caused by the shooting of a
bulldog, and the child was delivered at seven months. The
countenance is an almost exact imitation of a bulldog, with hair lip
[sic], flat nose, flattened eyes, large mouth, and the head set upon
the shoulders with no development of neck. There was a peculiar
hole in the back of the head [a case of anencephaly and/or spina
bifida?], said to be at the same position where the bullet struck the
dog, and on the back of the child is a mark like that left on the neck
of the dog by the burning of the powder. Dr. Senour has the child
preserved in alcohol, and it has been visited by many of our citizens,
and is, altogether, a remarkable case of this kind.
(This last case was also reported by the Chicago Tribune)
Another report about the 1880 birth near Troy appeared in the
Opelousas, Louisiana Courier (May 22, 1880, p. 3, col. 4):



Another Monstrosity
A correspondent of the Cincinnati Enquirer, writing from Troy,
Ohio, says: Your correspondent had exhibited to him this morning a
monstrosity the most wonderful. It is a child (born dead, of course)
with a dogʼs head. It was of about seven months gestation, and is in
all respects except the head a perfectly formed boy weighing two
and a half pounds. The parents are plain country folks, living about
eight miles from this place, both husband and wife young, the
husband about twenty-four years of age and the wife at the time of
the marriage, one year ago, only fifteen years of age. The wife is a
large, well-developed woman, young as she is. At the two monthsʼ
gestation of the mother, last November, the father had a young bull
pup, which from some cause had become cross and ugly and the
husband had often threatened to kill him, until finally one day the
father took down his gun, and against the protest of his wife, who
was present, shot the dog in the back of the head, just where the
head joins on to the neck. The blood spurted from the neck and the
wife fainted. The monster is in charge of Dr. Lenour [sic], who
attended the lady during her labor, and has been viewed by many
persons. It will be a great curiosity in the medical fraternity.
Texas. The following appeared in the Dallas, Texas, Daily Herald
(Aug. 17, 1880, p. 1, col. 2):
A Monstrosity at Waco
Special to the Herald.
Waco, Aug. 16.—Lottie Campbell, colored, twenty-one years old,
yesterday gave birth to a monstrosity. It had the face of a child, but a
nose that had no bone or bridge and only one nostril, a small round
hole looking outward instead of downward, as in the natural organ.
The hair began at the eyebrows and covered the entire head; was



very long, straight and thick, resembling a Newfoundland pup. The
jaws were also covered with long hair and flesh, and hung down like
a dogʼs upper lip. The spinal column was covered with very thick hair
and was pasted like on a fat dogʼs back. The collar bone and chest
were also covered with hair of astonishing growth for an infant. ...
The child, at the proper time, weighed five pounds, and lived four
hours.
Salzburg. In the Salzburger Chronik (Nov. 1, 1867, p. 189, col. 2), a
German language newspaper published in Salzburg, Austria, it is
stated that “not long since” a woman had given birth to a child that
had a dogʼs head and a breast that was woolly like a sheep, but that
was otherwise normal.
Vermont. The following two-sentence notice, which refers to an
event that allegedly occurred in the town of Morgan, Vermont, is
from the Orleans Independent Standard (Jun. 29, 1869, p. 3, col. 2),
a newspaper published in Irasburgh, Orleans County, Vermont: "A
lady in this town recently gave birth to a child with a dogʼs head. It
was permitted to die." Morgan is a town in the eastern part of
Orleans County, northeastern Vermont.
Arkansas. Another report about canine babes being birthed by a
woman appeared in the Memphis, Tennessee, Daily Appeal (Aug. 14,
1873, p. 1, col. 4):
LUSUS NATURAE
Extraordinary Freak of Nature Near
Arkadelphia, Ark.—Darwinian
Theory Reversed
Arkadelphia, Ark., August 13.—Mollie Holman, a negro woman
living about one mile from here, whose husband died a year ago,



gave birth on Monday night to five deformities, each weighing about
three pounds. The face of these wonderful creatures most resemble
a monkey, with the body and limbs of a dog, sparsely covered with
hair. They were alive this morning, and are fondly nursed by the awe
stricken mother. Our medical corps will visit the curious offspring
this evening.
Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. That same year, the following notice is
from the Watertown, Wisconsin, Republican (Jul. 30, 1873, p. 4, col.
2):
The Beaver Dam [Wisconsin] Argus reports that on Thursday night
a woman in that city was delivered of a monstrosity—half human and
half canine, the head, shoulders, arms, and upper part of the body
being a perfect formation of a child, while the lower part of the body
was as perfectly in the form of a dog.
In describing a birth that was like a human from the navel up, but
from there down, like a dog, this last case resembles four others
collected on this page, the birth at Raton, New Mexico in 1892, that
at Dechard, Tennessee in 1865, another at Leitmeritz, Bohemia in
1615, and the one at Rome in 1493.
A separate, brief 1873 report about a dog-human birth >>
A description of a dog-human conjoined twin, birthed by a bitch in
Raleigh, North Carolina in 1801, is given in the article on conjoined
twins.
Historical reports about human-dog hybrids
There are quite a few early reports about dog-human hybrids by
physicians and scholars. For example, an account of a canid-human
hybrid is given by the eighteenth-century French physician Jean



Bartholin1616-1680
Ferapie Dufieu. While listing the various odd cases he had
encountered during the course of his work, he mentions the
following (Dufieu 1763, p. 229):
At Lyon in 1757 I saw a monster with the head of a wolf, but with all
the remaining members of the body like those of a human being.
[Translated by E. M. McCarthy. Original French.]
Copenhagen. The Danish
physician and anatomist Thomas
Bartholin (1673, pp. 56-57)
reported that a child with a dogʼs
head had recently been born in
the city of Copenhagen, where he
was then residing, and that several
such births had occurred in that
city, though the parents for fear of
punishment had done their best to
prevent it from becoming public
knowledge. He also describes a
case, that of a conjoined triplet
birth produced by a certain Catharina Stein, the wife of a cobbler, in
the city of Drachenberg in Silesia on April 22, 1652. It supposedly
had three heads, one of which was like a wolf (see Bartholin 1661,
vol. 6, XLIX, p. 278-279).
Paris. The French physician Cosme Viardel (1748, pp. 227-233)
gives an eyewitness account describing how he delivered a child
with the head of a fox in Paris in 1667. According to the description
given, the child was otherwise normal.
Nierstein. The chronicler Eberhard Werner Happel (Historischer
Kern oder so genandte kurtze Chronica, 1690, p. 94) states that on



Paullini(1643-1712)
Zacchias(1584-1659)
October 2, 1681, a woman at Nierstein in Germany gave birth to a
child with a large dogʼs head. A separate case from the same period
is mentioned in Nitzschka (1685, p. 465).
Bavaria. And the German
physician Christian Franz Paullini
(1688, p. 49) describes a case of a
Bavarian woman who, in the year
of 1635, gave birth to a stillborn
“child,” supposedly having
a head entirely like that of a dog,
but hairless, a lolling tongue, the
legs of a dog in the place of arms,
and a short tail; the remainder of
the body being like that of a
human. [Translated by E. M.
McCarthy. Original Latin.]
Messina. A separate case was
reported that same year far to the
south of Bavaria. In a letter
appearing in an appendix of Paul
Zacchiasʼ Quaestiones medico
legales, the Italian physician and
botanist Pietro Castelli (1574
1662) gives the following account
of an ostensible human-dog
hybrid born to a woman in the city
of Messina on December 26, 1635
(translated in de Ceglia 2014):
It was shaped like a dog and its



sacrum seemed very wide and full, but without a tail. The skin or,
better, the cutis, was completely hairless, ruddy and highly tenuous,
only in this was it similar to a human. Instead, its head, considering
its shape and the position of the eyes, could be more easily
compared to that of a bird than to that of a dog, although the ears
were canine, the right one more oblong than the left one, sticking
straight up. In place of the nose it had a wide, pendulous membrane,
which, once dried, remained erect. It had a small, round mouth with
the two lower incisors. Its front feet were reminiscent of those of a
dog, but without nails; instead, the rear feet were truly monstrous:
they were made of four oblong fistulas, of equal size and empty, but
osseous, some of which had a sort of round plug at the end. Its
abdomen was swollen and livid. I immediately eviscerated it, but,
since the entrails were putrid and very fetid, I could not study them
carefully. I only observed that the left kidney was very large, but I did
not see the right one: I was not surprised since I was investigating
amidst decay and nauseating stench. Likewise, I was not able to
recognize its sex, but it seemed to me to be a female. The length of
the cadaver from its clavicle to the coccyx was a handbreadth, and
from head to toe a hand-breadth and a half. Then, with proper care, I
dried the body, which I keep in my museum, complete and
displayable.
A change of opinion
Itʼs of interest that de Ceglia 2014, p. 133 says that over the years, Zacchias, who at one time had some doubts about whether human-animal hybrids were possible, “would become more and more convinced and finally he would declare: ‘I was previously of that opinion, and now, I persevere much more in the [opinion] that nothing can prevent it that from the mixture of human seed with beastly seed some generation can follow.ʼ” (de Cegliaʼs translation of a passage in Quaestiones, Vol. III, Cons. XXII, p. 28).



Zacchias, who was a teacher of medical science and forensic
medicine, had been consulted by judges in Messina regarding
whether the birth could have been the result of hybridization
between the woman in question and a dog. In addition, Castelli
commented that
the cadaver with its occiput broken was brought to me two days
after the birth. The father said that while it was emerging from the
uterus the mother herself had pulled its head, and that it had broken.
But, for my part, I suspect that it was deliberately crushed because it
was a monster. [Translated in de Ceglia 2014.]
Leitmeritz. A German chronicle (quoted in Schurig, 1732, p. 61)
states that in the city of Leitmeritz in Bohemia (now Litoměřice in the
Czech Republic) in 1615,
An event occurred in which a woman, who had had relations with an
English hound, gave birth to a creature that was human from head to
navel, but the remaining half was dog, which shocked many who saw
it. The mother was at once imprisoned after the delivery. [Translated
by E. M. McCarthy. Original German.]
This creature, then, would have been similar to those described in
four other reports on this page (Rome 1493, Tennessee in 1865,
Wisconsin 1873, and New Mexico 1892). The following case (Zeitern)
is also of a generally similar nature, except in that it is also a case of
double-headed conjoined twins.
Zeitern. The German physician Johann Georg Schenck von
Grafenberg (c. 1560 - 1620) reports and pictures a very unusual
birth, which, he says, had two heads, and arms without hands (see
image right). He says (Schenck 1609, p. 20) this creature was
birthed on August 23, 1599, by a woman living in the village of
Zeitern, a mile from Brussels.



Schenckʼs depiction of the Zeitern birth
There is, however, some
confusion with regard to the
report because he alleges its
heads and legs were like an
apeʼs, and its body, like a
human beingʼs. And yet, his
illustration shows legs like
those of a dog, not an ape,
whereas the faces could just
as well be a humanʼs as an
apeʼs. Really, they are even
more like a human since the
pictured faces have rather
human-like noses.
So it may be that the general
lack of knowledge about apes
at that early date, misled
Schenck into saying the pictured legs looked like those of an ape
rather than of a dog. However, he does say that a dogʼs tail was
present, as can be seen in the picture. Therefore his illustration can
be reasonably interpreted as a creature with two human-like heads,
a human-like body (albeit with stump arms), but with doglike parts,
from the navel down, including the tail of a dog.
Thus, except in having two heads and stump arms,§ this creature
seems to have resembled four other cases on this page described as
human from the navel up and dog thence downward (the case at
Raton, New Mexico, in 1892, at Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, in 1873, at
Leitmeritz, Bohemia, in 1615, and at Rome in 1493).
§ The absence of one or more appendages, or portions of
appendages (stump limbs), seems to be more common in distant



Fortunio Liceti 1577-1657
hybrids. In the Zeitern case this tendency, then, would be
exemplified in the absence of hands.
Tonndorf. In his chronicle of Thuringia, Newe vollkommene
Thüringische Chronica (1613, vol. 3, p. 147), Johann Binhart records
that at 4 a.m. on November 1, 1556, the wife of a potter in Tonndorf,
Germany gave birth to an offspring with mixed human and canine
features.
Avignon. Galileoʼs friend, the
Italian scientist Fortunio Liceti
describes a dog-human born at
Avignon in France:
In his Miscellanies [the Italian
scholar Hieronymus] Magius [c.
1523-1572] relates that at
Avignon, in 1543, after a
connection of like nature, a woman
gave birth to a monster, having
indeed the head of a human being,
but the ears, neck, forelimbs,
paws, sexual organs, and other parts of a dog. The woman actually
admitted her pregnancy to have been initiated by the dog. And so, in
expiation of her sins, by order of Francis, King of the French [i.e.,
Francis I (reigned 1515-1547)], she was soon thereafter (July 31)
consigned to the flames, along with her dog lover. [Translated by E.
M. McCarthy. Original Latin.]
Magiusʼs original account of the French birth reads as follows (see
Magius 1564, p. 61):
It is recorded that in 1543 at Avignon, from intercourse of a similar
nature, a monster was produced with the head of a normal human



Benedetto Varchic. 1503 - 1565
being, but with the ears, neck, legs, paws, genitalia and other parts
of a dog ... Soon thereafter, then, on the 31st of July, by the decree
of Francis, King of France, both the hound and the mother were
consigned to the flames. Furthermore, many other, not very
different, cases occur. [Translated by E. M. McCarthy. Original Latin.]
The Italian historian Benedetto Varchi (c.
1503-1565), who also described this
hybrid, claimed (see Varchi 1834, p. 152)
that much of its body was “covered in
long black hair like that of the dog that
the mother had confessed to be the
father” (“coperte di pelo lungo e nero
come era il cane, col quale confessò poi
essersi giacciuta quella tal donna che
lʼaveva partorito”) and that “it lived so
long that it was taken from Avignon to
His Most Christian Majesty, King Francis, in Marseille” (“Visse tanto,
che fu portato da Avignone a Marsiglia al cristianissimo Re
Francesco”). Given travel times of the day and the fact that Marseille
is about 100 kilometers from Avignon, this last statement would
suggest this creature was sufficiently viable to have lived for at least
a few days.
Rome. The French surgeon and anatomist Ambroise Paré (Paré
1982, p. 67) writes that, “In the year 1493 a child [was born] having,
from the navel up,
upper parts similar in form and shape to the mother, and it was very
complete, without Natureʼs having omitted anything; and, from the
navel down, all its lower parts were also similar in form and shape to
the animal, that was the father: which (just as Volaterranus writes)
was sent to the pope who reigned at that time [Alexander VI].



Lecetiʼs depiction of the Roman birth.
Ambroise Paréc. 1510 – 1590
Liceti (1634, p. 184) also
mentions this event:
At Rome, an unmarried girl
gave birth to a son who was
half dog, which was human
from the navel up, but from
there down, like a dog. This
unnatural event is recorded by
Volaterranus, Cardan, Paré and
several others.
The 1493 event received more
attention than most cases,
apparently because it occurred
at Rome. It is also mentioned
by Bartholin (Historia
anatomicarum rariorum,
Hafniae, 1657) who states that
“At Rome under the pontificate
of Alexander [Cesare Borgia], a
woman bore a half-dog ...
according to the writing of Jo.
Langium I. 2. Epist. Med. 9"
(translated in Zirkle 1935: 56).
Simeone Maiolo (Dies
caniculares, vol. I, 42) also
refers to this birth. Johannes
Lange, the author cited by
Bartholin, himself cites
Volaterranus (Lange 1605, p.
377).



Wikipedia describes the Commentariorum urbanorum, as “an encyclopedia of all subjects known at that time, prepared with great care.” Volaterranus himself might have actually seen the product of the 1503 birth since he was then living in Tuscany at Volterra, the town for which he is named.
Note: The reported configuration of the Roman birth (human above,
canine below) is the same as that described in four other reports on
this page (Leitmeritz 1615, Dechard, Tennessee in 1865, Wisconsin
1873, and New Mexico 1892). Another mention of such a hybrid
appears in Lynch (1662), who states that “In 1433 there was born of
a woman a monster, of human form down to the waist, the lower
parts perfectly resembling a dog in hair, tail, feet and shape”
(translated in Kelly 1850, pp. 269-271). Here, however, "1493" was
probably intended, with "1433" being a typo.
Tuscany. Liceti (1634, p. 185) mentions another such birth, in
Tuscany, described by Volaterranus.
Volaterranus writes
(Commentariorum urbanorum
[1530, XXXII, p. 374]) that
under the reign of Pope Pius III
[whose pontificate followed
immediately upon that of
Alexander VI and lasted only 26 days (22 Sept. - 18 Oct. 1503)] in
Tuscany a certain girl, because she had been accustomed to lie with
a dog, became pregnant and gave birth to a child who was half dog,
that is, it had the fore- and hind-paws of a dog, as well as the ears,
but was otherwise like a human; the issue of how the girl should
atone for this sin was referred to the pope. [Translated by E. M.
McCarthy. Original Latin. Here Liceti closely follows Volaterranus.]
Medieval cases
Rolevinck. The Carthusian monk and historian Werner Rolevinck
(1425-1502) mentions a monster with a human body and a dogs
head as having existed in the year 914 (Rolevinck Fasciculus
Temporum, 1474).

1570, p. 30
)

Schenck 1609, p. 74
) More pictures >>
Liège. A case that received
far more attention than
Rolevinckʼs was reported from
what is now Belgium.
According to the Jesuit
Bartholomaeus Fisen (1591
1649), in 1125, a peasant
woman near Liège (in the
Hesbaye†) gave birth to a
conjoined twin (Historia
Ecclesiae Leodiensis, p. 357,
A. 1125). Fisen says it was
composed of two nearly
complete bodies—one, that of
a child, the other, that of a dog
—fused at the back so that
they faced in opposite
directions.
†Lycosthenes (1557, pp. 404
405), who is cited by several
later authors, claims that this
birth took place in Albania in
the year 1126. However, it
seems that he mistook the
Latin name for Hesbaye,
Hasbania, (which Fisen
specifically mentions) for
Albania, due to the similarity
between the long s symbol, s, and a lower case L. Fisen makes it
clear that 1125 is the correct date, not 1126.



A pair of conjoined twins described by Conrad Lycosthenes (1557, p.
352). The text in the figure may be translated as follows: “Towards
the end of the reign of Emperor Lothar, the commander of the
Saxons, a certain woman produced a monstrous birth, that is, a kind
of man and dog connected in a single body, joined at the back with
the spines solidly merged. The emperor died soon thereafter.” As
can be seen in the image above, Lycosthenes says this event
occurred in 854 A.D. Holy Roman Emperor Lothar I died the following
year. This case is sufficiently similar to the case reported as having
occurred in Liège in 1125 (see text above), that there is reason to
wonder whether the two reports may refer to the same event, but
with one or both dates being given in error. Lycosthenes served as a
professor at the University of Basel from 1545 until his premature
death at the age of 43.
Women giving birth to dogs
It is not very long since I received a letter from a distinguished member of the profession asking me whether, in my opinion, I thought it possible for a woman to give birth to a dog. —J. W. Ballantyne, M.D.



Brescia
In his Supplementum chronicorum (Paris, 1535, p. 382), the Italian chronicler Jacopo Filippo Foresti (1434-1520) records that at Brescia in Lombardy a woman gave birth to a dog in the year 1471, a case that parallels the cases reported by Stalpart vander Wiel and by Niels Heldvad at left.
Stalpart vander Wielʼs picture of a hairless puppy, which he claimed
was birthed by a woman. (source)
In his Observations, a
compilation of rare medical
cases, Dutch physician
Stalpart vander Wiel says that
in 1677 at The Hague, a
midwife, Elisabeth Tomboy,
assisted a woman in giving
birth to a living puppy (Observation LXXII), a female. His report
includes a picture (see above). As in Castelliʼs case quoted above,
vander Wiel says the weird offspring was hairless (“pilis carentem”).
“Remarkably, however, the woman remained pregnant,” he says,
“and, after 14 weeks, gave birth to a very healthy and quite normal
son” (translated from the original Latin by E. M. McCarthy).
Another such case, in which a woman was allegedly delivered of
three puppies that died soon after birth, is recorded by the German
chronicler Niels Heldvad (1564-1634). Supposedly it happened in
the Duchy of Schleswig at the outset of the seventeenth century
(see his Sylva Chronologica Circuli Baltici, 1625, Hamburg, p. 265).
Among the events that took place in the year 1600, he lists the
following:



Von Dreyhaupt1699-1768
A girl at Schwabstedt [a municipality that today lies in Schleswig
Holstein] became pregnant and gave birth to three puppies. They
died soon after birth. Supposedly, she had had congress with an
English hound. [Translated by E. M. McCarthy. Original German.
Confirmation from a different source: Nitzschka (1685, p. 465).]
The German historian Johann Christoph
von Dreyhaupt, in his treatise on his
native Halle (Beschreibung des
Saalkreises, 1755, vol. I, p. 646), states
that on March 5, 1646 a woman gave
birth to “what appeared to be a dog”
(“die wie ein Hund anzusehen
gewesen”) at Moritzburg Castle in
Saxony.
And writers during the early scientific
era (e.g., link, link) say “the monk Ulrich”
claimed that in the year 1000 a shepherdess at Visbek in Germany
lay with a hound and subsequently gave birth two puppies.
But this last story is so old as to verge on myth. It seems we have
reached the edge of the map of knowledge and arrived at the land
where doubt and fable reign. And such seems to be the nature of the
following account of a race of cynocephali given by Marco Polo.
Angamanain is a very large island. The people are without a king and
are idolaters, and no better than wild beasts. And I assure you all the
men of this island of Angamanain have heads like dogs, and teeth
and eyes likewise; in fact, in the face they are all just like big mastiff
dogs! They have a quantity of spices; but they are a most cruel
generation, and eat everybody that they can catch, if not of their
own race.



A non-reversible cross?
All of the various cases thus far cited have involved hybrids
supposedly birthed by women, that is, no dog mothers were
mentioned. From this, one might easily conclude that this cross non
reversible. However, there is a case, which apparently took place in
2007, reporting a dog producing a stillborn “puppy” with human
characteristics. Few details about this birth are available but the
photos are in fact suggestive of human parentage. And yet, for only a
single case among so many to involve a dog mother—and that single
specimen, moreover, to be stillborn—does seem to indicate that
there is strong directionality to this cross. Perhaps this, then, is why
the Babylonian Talmud says a widow should not rear dogs, but says
nothing about widowers?

specimen is reminiscent of some of the specimens pictured in the



caprinid-human hybrids section.
Do such hybrids exist?
There are, of course, many who believe that such births as those
listed above cannot be hybrids between a human and an animal.
People who take this stance argue these are wholly human infants
that are merely described as half-dog because they have certain
dog-like characteristics. In other words, there is an assumption that
traits falling within the normal range of human variation are being
falsely attributed to canine parentage. This sort of argument dates
back to Aristotle, who wrote that in such cases,
people say that the child has the head of a ram or a bull, and so on
with other animals, as that a calf has the head of a child or a sheep
that of an ox ... but they are none of the things they are said to be;
there is only some similarity, such as may arise even where there is
no defect of growth. [excerpt from Aristotleʼs The Generation of
Animals, (IV, iii), translated by Arthur Platt]
But one wonders what Aristotle would have said if confronted with a
birth such as the one Magius and Varchi claim occurred in Avignon in
1543 — an infant with a human face, but otherwise mostly dog-like,
though born of a woman. And what would he say of Stalpart vander
Wielʼs hairless puppy, also supposedly birthed by a woman? Would it
be reasonable for him to propose that such things fall within the
normal range of what we would call human variation?
Feral children
In connection with dog-human hybrids, the various stories dating
from ancient times to recent, of human beings being raised by dogs
and wolves are not without interest. The story of Romulus and
Remus is, of course, famous. And in his Decline and Fall of the



Roman Empire, Gibbon
notes that the Turks, too,
claimed “that their founder,
like Romulus, was suckled
by a she-wolf.” Similarly, the
Roman historian Justinus
claimed that Cyrus the
Great, founder of the Persian
Empire, was raised by a dog.
The notion of feral children being raised, or even conceived, by
wolves is an ancient tradition in India that continues to have wide
currency even today. For more information on this topic, see
Wikipediaʼs article on Amala and Kamala, two Indian girls supposedly
raised by wolves. Another interesting case of a child exhibiting
doglike behavior was described in a news report.
