Sarasvati holds Indus Script tradition writing instruments on her hands, Halebidu sculptures
Indus Script Writing tradition and Sculptural representations of historical periods as a continuum of celebration of knowledge systems signified by personified Devi Sarasvati. She holds bead strings on one hand and writing instruments on the other, signifying the continuum of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization tradition of lapidary work, metal work by artisans setting precious stones in metalbases and strubgubg together perforated beads into necklaces. The following enlarged segment of the sculpture clearly shows an inkpot into which a writing pen is dipped. Together with the alloy metal plate as the writing pad, the writing pen is held by the middle finger and the thumb of the left hand of Devi Sarasvati.
On the sculpture of Sarasvati shown seated on Brahma's lap (Halebidu sculptural representations presented below), holds writing insruments on one of her hands. I submit that these are: alloy metal tablet curved at two ends which is held together with a writing pen nib dipped into an iron oxide inkpot, Tge writing pen nib is comparable to three golden needles found in Mohenjo-daro; one of these needles is painted with Indus Script inscription. Kernoi rings are inkpots containing iron oxide.
