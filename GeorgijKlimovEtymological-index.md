Foreword
When the preparations for the publication of the present book had reached the stage of first proof and when Georgij A. Klimov had entered his corrections together with some substantial additions, his sudden death put an end to his scientific work; it was therefore only a preliminary version of his magnum opus that he was able to inspect. The task of seeing it through to completion was taken over by the late scholar's wife, Dzoj I. Edel'man, by two further Moscow colleagues, Jakov Testelec and Katino Godilia, and by myself; it is our hope that we achieved our goal of faithfully honoring G. A. Klimov's intentions. One of the strong points of the present volume is the emphasis placed on what the author considered to be evidence of ties between Kartvelian and Indo-European languages. Regardless of whether such ties point to some kind of genetic relationship or to prolonged contacts in the area south of the Caucasus, the data on which G. A. Klimov's conclusions were based deserve the close attention of Indo-Europeanists. They are of particular importance for an evaluation of the much-discussed "glottalic theory" as proposed in publications by Hopper and Gamkrelidze - Ivanov, respectively, and its implications for the question of the Indo-European "Urheimat"; Klimov's findings, which are by no means simple and noncontroversial, should contribute greatly to a clarification of issues. At the time of his death, the author was deeply involved in the collection of data for an inventory of central items from the lexicon of Caucasian languages; it is to be hoped that this work, the record of which now consists of numerous lists of forms, will eventually result in a published book. For the linguistic community the untimely death of G.A. Klimov means the loss of a renowned typologist, Caucasologist, and Indo-Europeanist; those of us who has the privilege of knowing him more closely deplore not only the passing away of a great scholar, but also that of a gentle person, a gentleman, and a friend. He will not be forgotten.

Preface
This edition of the etymological dictionary of the Kartvelian languages, prepared at the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, represents a major revision of its first version published more than thirty years ago (Klimov 1964). Kartvelian etymological studies have seen many new developments over this period of time, causing a difference of the present book from the previous one both in quality and in quantity. The dictionary contains about 1,400 word entries (the first edition had 954). More than thirty grammatical morphemes reconstructed earlier were excluded by the author; likewise, some twenty word comparisons which in the author's view had not stood the test of time, were omitted (usually, they are relatively recent borrowings - a fact which can be clearly demonstrated). All in all then, the glossary has been extended now by 440 new entries, which had been proposed by the present author or by other Kartvelologists such as K.H. Schmidt, T. Gamqrelije, G. Macavariani, H. Fähnrich, G. Kartozia, Z. Sar^velaje, and B. Gigineisvili. The remarkable increase in the number of suggested lexical correspondences derives mainly from two favorable factors: On the one hand, they were the result of a rather substantial expansion of the sources used by etymological research in Kartvelian linguistics. The Old Georgian dictionary (Abula3e 1973) has, in this respect, been one of the most helpful works over the past two decades. According to the estimates of A. Sanise, this dictionary contains about 80% of the vocabulary found in Old Georgian literary texts. At present, it is supplemented by the no less impressive Old Georgian dictionary by Z. Sar^vela^e (1995). The dictionary of Georgian dialects by A. ylonti (1984), which has seen two editions in a short period of time, also deserves attention. An enormous amount of lexical material, as of now not part of the literary standard, is found here; the work itemizes the data in a strict way, thus making it possible to identify Georgian Zanisms that left no trace in either of the Zan languages, Megrelian and Laz. The publication of a number of new dictionaries of individual Georgian dialects as well as of several articles on lexicology and comparative phonetics of the Kartvelian languages has also added to the contents of the iLtimologicesldj slovar' kartvel'skixjazykov.



VIII Preface
On the other hand, momentum was gained by the publication of a fundamental monograph on the reconstruction of the phonological and morphophonological systems of the Common Kartvelian stage (Gamqrelize-Macavariani 1965, 1982). The regularities observed by the authors in the phonological structure of Kartvelian roots and stems provide a firm basis for a multitude of comparisons. Finally, a new etymological dictionary appeared (H. Penrixi - Z. Sar^velase 1990; German version: Fahnrich-Sar|weladze 1995), which in our view noticeably advanced the general state of knowledge about Kartvelian etymology (cf. Klimov 1993). The present work is, however, based on different principles. First and foremost, it is a dictionary of lexemes. Second, it provides reconstructions of the semantics of the archetypes proposed. Third, it systematically registers the Indo-European equivalents of the Kartvelian forms - a matter of considerable current interest. Last, it is intended as a contribution to the discussion of the largely neglected question of Kartvelian-Armenian interaction. Two chronological levels of archetype reconstructions - an earlier (Common Kartvelian) stage and a later (Georgian-Zan) one, continue to be distinguished as they were in the earlier version of the dictionary; this distinction is of greatest importance for the analysis of Kartvelian language filiation. The approach used here consistently was first proposed by Deeters (1930); following it, the material common to Svan and Georgian or Zan languages is derived from proto-forms assigned to the Common-Kartvelian stage, while vocabulary shared by Georgian and one of the Zan languages can be projected back at least to the GeorgianZan stage. Quantitative aspects of the present dictionary indicate that there is a much greater genetically-caused similarity between Georgian and the Zan languages than there is between any of these languages and Svan. Thus, while some 480 lexemes and derivational elements are shared by Georgian and Svan and approximately 415 by Zan languages and Svan (the lower number explainable by the fact that less data are available for the Zan languages), more than 1,200 Georgian-Zan correspondences have been identified. (The proportions observed remain roughly the same for newly added material.) Qualitative characteristics of the CommonKartvelian inventory and of the exclusive Georgian-Zan isoglosses serve to confirm the different degrees of relatedness. Thus, while, for instance, adjectives can be reconstructed with confidence for the Georgian-Zan stage, their presence at the Common Kartvelian level is open to question



Preface IX
of four adjectives claimed to date from the proto-language stage, two derive from participles with a prefix m-, while the other two seem to be borrowed forms (cf. Klimov 1992). Furthermore, there is ample evidence in terms of meaning that the Georgian-Zan correspondences reflect a considerably more recent stage in the historical development of Kartvelian society. The new material now available to scholars, as well as other considerations, can be used to support this author's earlier expressed view that cattle-breeding vocabulary is common to Svan and other Kartvelian languages while agricultural terms are rarely shared; the designations of metals and of all kinds of equipment of a more recent period common to other Kartvelian languages are absent in Svan. Using the methods of glottochronology as introduced by Morris Swadesh, the absolute time of separate development can be fixed for these languages at approximately 2,600 and 4,200 years, respectively. In other words, the Georgian-Zan complex should have begun to disintegrate at the beginning of the first millennium B.C., while the differentiation of Georgian-Zan and Svan should date from a period not later than the last centuries of the third millennium B.C. Common-Kartvelian (and Georgian-Zan) forms have undergone a number of changes in the daughter languages. In the realm of vocalism, Common Kartvelian *e and *a yield in Megrelian and Laz a and o, respectively (the shift does not take place in the coda of substantives). If in Zan forms ο is found instead of regularly expected a (corresponding to Georgian e), it is assumed that either such forms formerly contained a parallel vocalism *a or that Georgian e resulted from an ancient umlaut (cf. the alternative interpretations Georgian tred- 'dove': Zan toro$ < Pre-Zan *trad- or Georgian tred- < *tradalongside regular Zan toro^-). Even taking into account a number of cases which have been explained in special publications, it has to be noted that there are clearly more correspondences Georgian α: Zan ο than Georgian e: Zan a.
Changes of Common-Kartvelian consonants affect the fricatives *ί,, and *Zi, and the affricates *c{, *c,, and *^,, which are reflected in the Zan languages and Svan by s and z and by c, c, and $, respectively. Besides, the Common-Kartvelian fricative *s and the affricates *c, *c, and *$ develop into the complexes sk, ck, ck, and $g, respectively. This interpretation of the evolution of the phonological systems under consideration is corroborated by some ancient borrowings from Indo-European and Semitic sources (cf. Georgian svid-, Zan skvit-, Svan isgwid- 'seven'



X Preface
beside Akkadian sibit 'seven' or Georgian sus-, Zan susk- 'to bake well, to dry' beside Indo-Aryan sus- 'to dry'). The conditions for the development of clusters in Zan and Svan were determined long ago (for Gamkrelidze's Law - cf. Gamqreh^e 1959 and Macavariani 1965; some exceptions are discussed in Kartozia 1984). The model of a Common-Kartvelian phonological system developed by Gamqrelije-Macavariani (1965) provides the essential basis for the sound shape of the reconstructed forms; among other things the authors assume that the phonological system of Common Kartvelian contained, along with vowels and consonants proper a class of resonants (*vv>, *j, */, *r, *m, *n) with syllabic and nonsyllabic allophones. The two scholars suggest that a Common-Kartvelian opposition between short and long vowel phonemes was partly preserved in Svan; this suggestion is accepted by the present author. The canonical structure of the Kartvelian verb and noun root can then be described as CV(:)C\ the positions C can be filled not only by a single consonant (or resonant), but also by a harmonic cluster or a Cw combination; the position V is mostly filled by e. The claim that Kartvelian root ablaut (with full and zero vowel grades) is an old phenomenon has in this dictionary been taken to be justified. A number of other proposals made in the past is also taken into account. Here belongs the observation that in both native and borrowed forms of Megrelian the second element of a CC cluster is anticipated in the preceding syllable - cf. Georgian-Zan *ceck- 'to make hollow, to break to pieces' > Megrelian ckack- (cf. Macavariani 1965; GudavaGamqrelije 1981). Also, the old conclusion is still valid that in Zan languages the sequence we in the penultimate syllable of a noun does not undergo change (as opposed to the development *e > a found elsewhere in this position), in most cases apparently due to an earlier effect of umlaut (cf. Gamqreli3e-Macavariani 1965) - isolated cases such as Megrelian γναΐρ- '(hot) ashes' beside Georgian γνβΐρ- and Megrelian cvat- alternating with cvet- 'drop' are in need of an explanation. Furthermore, the regularity of the correspondence between word-internal Megrelian r and Laz n (cf. Megrelian gir$e-: Laz ginge- 'long') is also taken into consideration. Finally, this dictionary takes note of some conclusions recently reached in the field of comparative Kartvelian phonetics. Two findings by I. Melikisvili (1981) are to be mentioned: She observes a change *e > i before « in Zan languages, and she arrives at the conclusion that the cor

respondence Svan st (> sd II st): Georgian-Zan t presupposes a preaspirated *t at the Common-Kartvelian stage (which means that there is no need to postulate, here and in similar cases, a Proto-Kartvelian cluster *s, /, which would complicate the phonological structure of a number of root morphemes and would result in a deviation from the canonical pattern). The increase in lexical entries makes the sound-symbolic role of final abruptive -p in verb stems (cf. *zep-, *lip-, *tkep-, *ckep-, etc.) and of ο in some nouns and verbs (cf. *bod-, *gor-, *lok-, *c\, oc\,-) even more obvious. In the dictionary there are also some examples of that type of irregular correspondences which VI. Abaev considers to be crossisoglosses. In some cases our current state of knowledge puts limitations on the explanation of the data. Thus, side-by-side with the not uncommon realization of the development *a > *o > u next to a labial in Zan languages, there are a great many cases of an absence of u grade (cf. *bade-, *baga-, *bandy-, *wac,-, etc.). Because of the obvious difficulties in determining quantity in Common Kartvelian and in GeorgianZan, no vowel length has been indicated in proto-forms; while Svan facts and certain correspondences between Georgian and Zan vowels do offer helpful hints, it seems unwarranted to base conclusions in this matter above all on data from Svan dialects distinguishing vowel length. As concerns χ vs. q, in many cases where the identity of the sound cannot be established on Old Georgian or Svan evidence, an χ has been tentatively entered. The present version of the dictionary gives special attention to matters of word formation; in this way it has become possible to see derivational relations between a number of lexemes formerly considered unrelated to each other. Derivational archetypes were discovered; thus, a group of Georgian-Zan deverbal nouns formed with a suffix -e (*nat-e-, *yob-e-, *CiX-e-, etc.) is identified. In the area of semantic reconstruction, the author tried to follow a history-based approach and to avoid ascribing meanings to lexical protoforms which they could not have possessed at a given time; above all he tried to avoid an unintentional modernization of their semantic structure. As far as possible the book attempts to identify probable sources of old loanwords from other languages, with particular emphasis given to parallelisms in Indo-European languages. Such parallelisms are of particular interest for areal-linguistic studies now under way. Recent work on the subject (Gamkrelidze-Ivanov 1984, 1994; Klimov 1994) can be seen to



XII Preface
support claims of early contacts between Kartvelian and Indo-European languages and the hypothesis that the Indo-European Urheimat should be located to the south of the historical homeland of the Kartvelians (if proof could be offered for a genetic relationship between the two language groups, the hypothesis mentioned would gain in probability). The Kartvelian homeland seems to have been the Great Caucasus and the Little Caucasus; this appears to be indicated by lexical data. In the view of Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1984: 880-881, 1994: 777), the Common Kartvelian language is to be dated in the fourth and third millennia B.C. These authors state furthermore (1984: 881, 1994: 777): "Proto-Kartvelian prior to its breakup must be placed, on the evidence of archaic lexical and toponymic data, in the mountainous regions of the western and central part of the Little Caucasus (the Transcaucasian foothills). The first wave of Kartvelian migrations to the west and northwest, in the direction of the Colchidian plains, must have begun with one of the western dialects in the third millennium B.C. and led to the formation of Svan, which spread to the western Transcaucasus and was superimposed on local languages, probably of the Northwest Caucasian type, which thus became substratal to Svan. Svan was gradually displaced to the north, to the Great Caucasus range, by the next wave of migrations, which occurred approximately nine centuries later (on glottochronological evidence) and removed the westernmost remaining dialect as far as the Black Sea coast. This western dialect gave rise to the later Colchidian - or Zan, or Mingrelian-Laz language, one of the languages of ancient Colchis. The dialects which remained in the ancient Kartvelian homeland underlie Georgian. In historical times, speakers of Georgian spread to the west, to part of the Colchidian territory, splitting the Colchidian language into two dialects and setting up the development of Mingrelian and Laz (Chan) into independent languages. They also spread to the north and northeast, displacing languages of the Northeast Caucasian type." (English version by Johanna Nichols; deviations from the Russian original will be disregarded here.) The impossibility, noted in special writings, of etymologizing Georgian macrohydronymics on the basis of Kartvelian languages is not surprising once one accepts a relatively late date for Kartvelian settlement in the lower valleys of the major Transcaucasian rivers; conversely, it makes sense that some rivers in the extreme southwest of the Kartvelian area (cf. Corox-, Cxala-) seem to have genuine Kartvelian names in Zan guise.



Preface χιιι
It is only natural to expect that further growth of etymological research in Kartvelian will depend crucially on more lexical data from Laz and Svan becoming available. The dictionary uses a number of conventional symbols. Abbreviations CK and GZ point to the Common Kartvelian or Georgian-Zan level of reconstruction respectively. Square brackets signify that the form inside them is not used as such in the modern language, but can be somehow extracted (for instance, it is found in a bound form only). Brackets in the phonological recordings show the optional nature of the phonemes inside them. A colon dividing verbal roots indicates their alternations (above all, in accordance with ablaut). Old Georgian forms are documented by their occurrences in medieval literary texts. The names of the original proponents of comparisons are given whenever it is possible.

A
CK *a- pronominal stem, proximal (opposed to distant */-): Georg. a-\ Megr. a—; Laz a-, ha—; Svan a—. In unbound form the stem is rarely attested: cf. Laz a ham mtuti boskurina-... 'there's a bear I'll frighten... '(£T3: 37.31). It occurs ordinarily combined with other pronominal stems: cf. Georg, α-ma- 'that, this', a-k-a 'here', a-s-e 'so'. Absence of regular correspondence in the vocalism of the stem is due to its interjectional nature.
CK *a- verbal prefix of causative: Georg, a-, Megr. o-\ Laz o-; Svan a-. Causative and permissive. In Zan languages it is regularly reflected as o-: cf. Georg, m-a-su 'he gave me to drink', Megr. m-o-pucuans 'he makes me swear', Svan x-a-tr-e 'he gives him to drink'. A Georgian-Zan causative is usually formed with a circumfix: see *a --- in.
CK *-a suffix of deverbative action noun: Georg, -α; Megr. -a; Laz -a; Svan -a. Widely attested in Old Georgian: cf. sum-α- 'drinking', cam-α- 'eating', zraxv-a- 'thinking'. Being productive in modern Georgian and Megrelian (cf. sum-α- 'drinking', ngar-a- 'weeping', gimu-a- 'croping', etc.), it survives in Laz only in a few nouns: barva- 'blowing', koma'smoke', mcima- 'rain'. For the Svan equivalent cf. gargla 'talk', dagra 'murder', kweda 'lack, deficiency'. | | USKJa: 42.
GZ *-ad affix of adverbial derivation: Georg, -ad; Megr. -o(i)\ Laz
In Old Georgian characterized by high productivity: cf. did-ad 'strongly, very', kual—ad 'afterwards, again', ert—ad 'together, at once'. It coincides with the ending of the Common Kartvelian transformative case *-ad. Productive in Megrelian, in Laz it is found only in a few petrified forms like ako Once' and dido 'very'.
CK *ad-//had- 'azalea (pontica)': Megr. [od-] 'azalea (pontica)'; Svan ad-ra—, had—ra,
Retained only in Svan, where -ra functions as a derivational element usually in the names of plants and trees. From here probably originates the Svan toponym Adis-. A Megrelian cognate may be extracted from the traditional designation of Megrelia Odis—. For —is in both cases see *—is^
1



*adr-a(d)
GZ *adr-a(d) 'early, fast': Georg, adrad 'fast'; Megr. ordo- 'morning'; Laz odro, ordo 'early, fast'. The Georgian adverb is well attested in medieval texts (cf.also modern Georgian adre 'early, soon'). The word reflects the form of transformative case. Cf. Old Georgian adre 'quickly, tomorrow'. The semantically deviating Megrelian form is a noun. In Zan cognates metathesis of consonants has occurred. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 199-200).
GZ *a en//—in circumfix of the causative verbs: Georg, a en//—in; Megr. ο in;Laz ο in.
Georg, -en marks only the presentic tense word-forms (cf. a-dg-en-s 'he establishes' alongside da-a-dg-in-a 'he established'). In Zan languages only -in is found. Cf. Megr. v-o-dg-in-ank Ί put it', Laz v-o-xom-in-ap Ί dry it'.
CK *at- 'ten': Georg, at- 'ten'; Megr. vit-; Laz vit-; Svanjesd-,jest-. Attested in Old Georgian. In the Zan branch and in Svan its initial vowel is removed in different ways. Already Bopp (1847: 40) assumed that j of the Svan numeral had arisen phonetically. The correspondence Georg.-Zan t ~ Svan st (> sd II st) presupposing so-called preaspirated *t is regular. An early borrowing? Cf. *αηνα—, *ekslw—, *otxo—, *s(i)wid-.
| | Rosen (1845: 11).
CK *-am : -m verbal thematic affix: Georg, -am : -m; Megr. -urn, -9m; Laz —um, -im; Svan -em.
Less characteristic for Svan (cf. *bam— : bm—; *dgam— : dgm—; *tkwam- : tkm-, etc.). The Georgian-Zan material reflects two ablaut grades —full and zero grade, whereas Svan -em continues only the full one. In Old Georgian -am sometimes alternates with —em (cf.vsuam // vsuem Ί drink'). The use of this affix is limited to the presentic tense wordforms. | | Deeters (1930: 122-123).
CK *a-ma- 'that, this': Georg, ama- : am- 'that, this'; Megr. amu-; Laz (h)amu—; Svan am(a)—.
Demonstrative pronoun combining the deictic stems *a— and *ma-: a of the latter is reflected in Zan as o (> u next to labial) in accordance with



*anc1 Ι
α sound correspondence known for words used as adjectives. In Svan it is attested in ama-s 'to that' (dat.) and ama-w 'here, so far'. In Megrelian the stem is not used as a free form; it occurs only as the first part of compounds with an adverbial function. | | Schmidt (1962: 92).
CK *anc!l- 'elder': Georg, and- 'elder'; Megr. incir-, incar-; Laz incir(a}-·, Svan g ncw-.
Priority of the initial vowel seems unlikely, but difficulties with initial g in Svan permit one to assume here a loss of some "weak" consonant (cf. Marr 1912.2: 1095; Gamqre^e - Macavariani 1965: 82). A former stem-final / is regularly rendered in Svan by w, which makes it impossible to consider the word a Zanism. For i in the first syllable of the Zan forms instead of Georg, a cf. *at-, *kra\v-, *kwab-, *$incar-. \ | Marr (1912.2: 1095).
CK *a—r- 'to be': Georg, ar—'to be'; Megr. or—, Laz or-; Svan ά>—, or—. Widely attested in Old Georgian: igavi igi ese ars... 'the parable is this...' Lk. 8.11. Apparently it is a lexicalized form of the verb stem *rmerged with the former version prefix a-. Cf. the modern Georg, v-ar Ί am', x-ar 'you are (sing.)'. For its Zan cognate cf. Megr. or-d-a-s and Laz or-t-a-s 'let him be'. In Svan the stem is represented in such forms as xw-ar-i Ί am', χ- r-i 'You are'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 628). Laz, Svan: Cikobava (1938: 307).
CK *arwa- 'eight': Georg, rva-, rua- 'eight'; Megr. mo-, bruo-; Laz orvo—, ovro—; Svan am—. Well documented in Old Georgian (yitarca ayesrulnes dyeni rvani... 'when eight days were accomplished ...' Lk. 2.21). Final *a as in other attributively used words yields Zan o. Georgian and Megrelian forms lost the initial vowel. Consonantal metathesis in Laz as well as loss of w in Svan result from a reshaping of the cluster rw, unusual for Kartvelian roots. For the reconstruction of the protoform see Gamqrelije (1959: 52). The word belongs to a set of early Semitic loanwords (cf. Akkad. arb as dual ofarba 'four'). | | Rosen (1845: 11).
GZ *ar£w- 'chamois': Georg, arcv- 'chamois'; Megr. erckem-, erskem-. For the correspondence Georg, c ~ Zan ck (in position after r) see



*asul
*purc-, *qlec-. The element -em in Megrelian requires an explanation. Svanjerskan,jersken, hersk(n)- 'chamois' is apparently a Zan loanword, cf. Megr. ercken-k (narrative case). 1 1 Marr (1915.1: 213). Cf. Schmidt (1961: 153).
CK *asul- 'daughter': Georg, asul- 'daughter'; Megr. osur- 'woman, wife'; Laz osur- 'daughter, girl'; Svan asus, (h)aswis. The kinship term is widely attested in Old Georgian: asuli martoj esua mas 'he had only one daughter' Lk. 8.42. According to Vogt (1974: 107) the root is the same as that found in the verbal word-form e-su-a 'he had him, her'. Hence the initial a would be a prefix. For the correspondence Georg. / ~ Svan s in nouns see *til-, *c}ol-, *c^ul-, etc. The change u > wi in Svan is a result of umlaut. The Megrelian form underwent a semantic shift. | | Georgian, Zan: Brosset (1849: 70-72). Svan: Marr (1917: 314).
CK *a-Si- deictic stem: Georg, äse 'so'; Megr. [as-]; Laz [as-]; Svan as 'so'. A combination of the pronominal stems *a- and *i,-; cf. also */-*,-. In Old Georgian it survives in asre 'so'. In Zan languages it can be seen in some adverbs: cf. Megr. aso 'here', as(i) 'so' and Laz aso II haso 'so', where —o is a petrified case ending. 1 1 USKJa: 4 6 .
CK *as!ir- 'hundred': Georg, as- 'hundred'; Megr. os-; Laz os-; Svan osir, äsir.
The numeral is widely attested in Old Georgian: ...osi mart zeti '...hundred measures of oil' Lk. 16.6. Since Svan lacks a derivational element -ir, it is natural to consider it to be an organic part of the stem lost in the Georgian-Zan area (cf. *ixwir- 'duck'). The numeral has apparently a Semitic source (cf. Akkad. 'esr 'ten'). 1 1 Rosen (1845: 11).
GZ *a-k- 'here': Georg, ak 'here'; Megr. ak, tak, atak; Laz ak, ako. The adverb oka is well attested in Old Georgian: momec me oka lanklita tavi lovane natlis-mcemelisa... 'Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger ...' Mt. 14.8. It contains a combination of the pronominal stems *a- and *k-; its counterpart is *i-k- 'there'. | | Cf. Cikobava (1938: 225).



GZ *ay- preverb of direction 'up, upwards': Georg, a- preverb of direction 'up, upwards'; Megr. o-; Laz. o-. The Old Georgian form is ay-: cf. ayzrda 'education', ays/να 'ascent, rise', ayprena 'flying up', etc. Cf. its derivative m-αγ-αΐ- 'high'. In many cases the prefix has lost its locative function. In all languages the preverb underwent simplification: cf. Georg, a-vedi Ί rose', Megr. o-b-ckomi Ί ate', Laz o-putxu 'he flew up'. 1 1 Cf. Deeters (1930: 14).
CK *aqare— 'gourd': Megr. qoqore— 'gourd'; Laz qoqore—, ojore—, ore—', Svan (h)aqar, aq r.
Apparently Common Kartvelian term. The Zan forms, where wordinitial α must be secondary, and their Svan equivalent are regular phonetical matches. In view of the initial vowel the term seems to be an old loanword. Cf. also Georg, aqiro- with the same meaning which, however, does not fit the archetype. Cf. lavaxisvili (1934: 273).
GZ *a-c- 'henceforth, from now on': Georg, ac, aci 'henceforth, from now on'; Megr. ac(i), anc(i); Laz a(n)ci. Amply attested in Old Georgian (cf. ac iqsenin igi ... 'let him deliver him now...' Mt. 27.43), where it formed the basis for a number of derivatives. The initial *a- can be identified as the pronominal stem *a-. 1 1 £SKJa: 4 7 .
GZ *axl-a(d) 'now, recently' (adv.): Georg, αχ/α 'now'; Laz xolo 'now, again'. Found in Old Georgian in the shape of axlad: se-tu vinme-irtos coli axlad...'when a man hath taken a new wife...' Deut. 24.5. Cf. its derivative axlad-sobil- 'new-born' (Abulase 1973: 27). Its Laz equivalent points to an earlier form oxolo. Whether Megr. xolo 'again' is connected directly remains unclear.
GZ *axlo- 'near' (adverb): Georg, αχ/ο- 'near' (adv. and adj.); Megr. xolo 'near, by'. Widely used in Old Georgian sources: axlo am arej... 'summer is near...' Mk. 13.28; cf. its synonym axlos with the parallel Megr. xolos. The word must be regarded as a derivative from the verbal base *xal— : xl- 'to be among, amidst sth., near to sth.'. The Megrelian equivalent presupposes an earlier form *oxolo.



B
CK *b- 'to pour': Megr. b-t 'to pour'; Laz b-\ Svan b-. The protoform is based on Zan and Svan material: cf. Megr. geiobes 'they poured', Laz kogobu 'he poured', Svan maba 'it is poured on me' (action noun of the latter is li-beni). In Georgian the stem seems to be lost. It remains uncertain whether the Svan base bib- II bb- 'to pour, spill, shed' (xwabbe Ί pour', noun of action li-bb-e) is related. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 250). Svan: &SKJa: 47.
CK *b- 'to tie, bind': Georg. b~ 'to tie, bind; to hang'; Megr. b-\ Laz b-; Svan b-. The stem occurs in Old Georgian: mun eba... 'there was attached...' (cf. Abulage 1973: 32). It characterizes the word-forms of aoristic group tenses. For the Zanequivalent cf. Laz. koco-v-o-b-i Ί tied', for Svan lo-b-e 'tied'. Cf. also the derivative stem *bam- : bm-, formed by means of the thematic extension -am : -m. The meaning 'to hang' of the Georgian and Zan cognates seems to be secondary. | | Cikobava (1938: 250).
GZ *baga- 'sheep-pen, goat-pen; floor of pen; crib': Georg, baga- 'crib'; Megr. boga- 'floor of pen, floor of cattleshed; little bridge made of planks'; Laz boga- 'sheep-, goat-pen'. Attested in Old Georgian: pirutquta bagasa... 'in the crib of the cattle...' Sin. mr. 7.21. The primary meaning remains uncertain; the Megrelian verb bogua- 'to lay a bridge' apparently is denominal. WestGeorg, boga- 'shelf is a Zan loanward. Svan (Lasx.) baga must have been borrowed from Georgian. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 41). Laz: USKJa: 48.
CK(?) *bade- 'net, cobweb': Georg, bade- 'net'; Laz boda- 'netting for picking fruits'; Svan bad, bad 'netting, cobweb' (?). Georgian-Zan word well known in Old Georgian: ara ganstkda badej igi 'was not the net broken' Jn. 21.11. In Megrelian it is perhaps lost. The final vowel needs an explanation: cf. the unexpected a in Laz. The Svan equivalent may stem from a Georgian source. | | Georgian, Laz: Deeters (cf. Schmidt (1962: 95). Svan: USKJa: 48.



*bal
GZ *bal- 'sweet cherry': Georg, bal- 'sweet cherry'; Megr. bul- 'sweet cherry, birch'; Laz bul- 'cherry, sweet cherry'. In Old Georgian texts the word seems to be unattested. The vowel correspondence is regular (cf. expected o > u next to labial consonant). The lexeme must be a cross-cultural term borrowed from an unknown Asianic source. Arm. bal 'cherry', Class. Pers. bälü, Kurd, balu, and similar Daghestanian forms (cf. Cax.bali, Andi bali, Avar baRli 'sweet cherry') must have the same origin. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 76). The material is summarized in Marr (1915.1:826).
CK *b-am- : b-m- 'to tie, bind': Georg, bam- : bm- 'to tie, bind; get attached'; Megr. burn-; Laz burn-; Svan bem-. Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian: cf. action nouns abma—, gamobma-, etc. (Abulaje 1973: 1, 40). Derived from *b- 'to tie, bind' with a thematic extension *-am : -m (action noun Georg, bma-, Megr. buma-, Svan li-bem) characteristic for word-forms of the presentic series. | | Georgian, Svan: Wardrop (1911: 629). Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 192). Laz: USKJa: 48.
GZ *ban- 'to wash, wash oneself: Georg, ban- 'to wash, wash oneself; bathe'; Megr. ban—; Laz bon—, mbon—. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian: daibane piri seni... 'wash your face...' Mt. 6.17 (action noun bana—, banil— 'washed', ubanel'unwashed'). The initial m of the Laz cognate is a recent development. The question arises whether the archetype is related to the parallel stem *bar- : br- with the same semantics. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895, XII: 105). Cf. Cikobava (1938: 254-255).
CK(?) *band- 'to interweave, plait': Georg, band- 'to interweave, plait'; Megr. bond-; Svan band- 'to darn, patch up'(?). According to S. Orbeliani, the Georgian derivative band-ul- denotes a kind of bast shoe. At present the base in its initial meaning occurs in Xevs. dialect, whereas in Gur. it means an incoherent talk (cf. yionti 1984:53). The Megrelian cognate is represented by the nouns bond- 'suspended bridge (wattled with living plants)' and bondul- 'seine'. The Svan stem may,however, be a simplification of a Georgian borrowing blandva— 'to patch up'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Illic-Svityc (1971: 194).



*bandy
GZ *bandy- 'to twist, tie together': Georg, bandy- 'to interlace'; Megr. bondy- 'to net,spin, web'. Apparently the verb stem does not occur in Old Georgian texts. Cf. the Georgian dialectal (Imer.) noun correlate bandy- 'cobweb' and the Megrelian action noun bondyua- alongside gobondyil- 'cobweb' (literally past participle 'interlaced'). The Laz equivalent is probably lost. Note a special similarity to Indo-Aryan bandh- 'to tie' (< PIE *bhendh-). | | Zyenti (1940: 225). Cf. Fähnrich (1982: 34).
GZ *ban-il- 'washed': Georg, banil- 'washed'; Megr. bonil-, bonir-; Laz boner-.
Attested in Old Georgian sources: banilsa mas am uqms bana... 'he that is washed needeth not...' Jn. 13.10, where it means also 'baptized' (Abulaje 1973:29). It is a past participle in -il based on the verb stem *ban-. The Laz cognate is adapted to adjectives ending in -er.
CK *bar- : br- 'to wash': Laz bor-, mbor- 'to wash, bathe'; Svan bar(bär-) : br-.
In Laz the verb stem functions as a complement to bon- (see *ban-): umbortusa... 'while he washed him...' alongside ibondes 'they washed themselves'. In Svan, where it shows ablaut alternation (cf.action noun li-bar, li-br-al II li-br-al), the parallel stem is lacking. In Georgian no certain cognate is found. 1 1 Penrixi-Sar^velase (1990:44).
GZ *barbac- 'to reel, stagger': Georg, barbac- 'to reel, stagger'; Megr. [borboc-].
Unattested in Old Georgian. The Zan cognate seems to have been lost in the Zan languages, but is reflected in the Georgian dialectal (Ajar.) Zanism borboca— 'staggering (man)' (cf.yionti 1984: 81). This obviously reduplicated form must be somehow connected with the verb stem *bec- 'to move by touch, grope'.
GZ *bard- 'blackthorn, sloe': Georg, bard- 'blackthorn, sloe'; Megr. burd—.
Attested in medieval Georgian texts. The vowel correlation in the compared forms is regular — expected in Megrelian yields u next to a labial. The Georgian compound bard-burd- 'sloe' is based on the alternation a ~ u, characteristic for reduplicative formations and its second
8



»bark
component has nothing to do with the Megrelian form. The word cannot derive from Arm. barti 'poplar' (cf., however, Acafyan 1971: 430). 1 1 Klimov (1988: 153).
CK(?) *bark- 'thigh, haunch': Georg, bark-al- 'thigh (of animal, bird)'; Megr. bork- 'shin, shank'; Svan [bark-]. Occurs in Old Georgian texts: igi kelobda barklita... 'he halted upon his thigh...' Gen. 32.31. Georg, -al is a word-formation affix. According to Schmidt (1962: 95), the Megr. form underlies derivative borkua- 'to fetter'. In Svan the stem can be recovered in the derivative barkä- 'bowlegged'. Cf. Gelenise (1974: 81). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian : Marr (1913.3: 27).
GZ *barci- 'barren, dry': Georg, here- 'barren'; Megr. burc- 'dry (of a cow)'. Adjective widely attested in Old Georgian: cf. netar arian bercni... 'blessed are the barren...' Lk. 23.29, action noun bercoba- 'barrenness'. Occurs also in a variant belc- (yionti 1984: 68). In Laz it is apparently lost. The vocalic pattern of cognates allows one to reconstruct a vowel *a resulting in Zan in o > u next to a labial. Cf. Macavariani (1958: 275-276). Svan bruc— with the same meaning seems to be a Megrelian loanword. |'| USKJa: 49.
GZ *ba(r)|- 'brace, prop; stake, picket': Georg. bar$- 'stick (forked)'; Megr. [bo(r)$g-] 'brace, stake'; Laz bo$g- 'tree (branchy)'. Attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abulaje 1973: 29). The Megrelian cognate survives vestigially as a Zan loanword in Western dialects of Georgian (yionti 1984: 82, 86). The connection with the Common Kartvelian verbal stem *be§-: b$- 'to lean (on); rest (against)' is obvious. | Georgian, Megrelian: Klimov (1988: 153).
GZ(?) *baqw- 'thigh, haunch': Georg, baqv- 'thigh, haunch'; Megr. boqv-. Somewhat problematic comparison. In Old Georgian the lexeme seems to be absent. The vowel o in Megrelian remains unclear: after a regular shift a > next to a labial the expected vocalism would be rather u.
GZ *bger- 'to utter; sound, ring': Georg, bger- 'sound, sounding'; Megr. ngar-, gar- 'to tear, mourn'; Laz bgar-, mgar-.
A tentative comparison. The noun bgera- is well known in Old Georgian, where it meant 'loud sound, groan(ing), noise' (Abulase 1973: 30). Among



*bdw
Zan forms the Laz one retains an ancient shape (action noun o-bgar—u, o-bgar-in-u). In Megrelian the stem is reinterpreted: cf. i-b-gar-k Ί tear', where b is a subject prefix of the 1 person singular. Though this equation holds formally, semantically it seems somehow dubious. | | Megrelian, Laz:Schuchardt (1902.2: 393).Georgian: USKJa: 49.
CK *bdw- 'to set, catch fire'; Georg, [bdv-] 'to set, catch fire'; Laz φ>)-; Svan bid-, bd-. The verb stem occurs in its unbound shape only in Laz and Svan. Cf. the action noun Laz o-d—u, Svan li—bid (and ma—bid 'combustible'). Their Georgian cognate may be extracted from the derivative *bdw-in-.
CK *bdw-in- 'to set fire'; Georg, \bdvin—] 'to set fire'; Laz dvin—\ Svan bdin-.
A verb stem based on *bd\v-. It is attested in Old Georgian indirectly: cf. participle m-bdwin-vare- 'kindled' (Abulaje 1973: 224). In other languages the consonantal cluster has been simplified. For Laz cf. action noun me—dvin—u, b—u-dvin—am Ί set fire to it'. The Svan action noun is li-bdin-e.
| | Georgian, Svan: F hnrich (1985: 26).
GZ *bez- 'to thrash, belabor': Georg, bez- 'to belabor, beat strongly'; Megr. baz-, Laz baz-,
In Old Georgian the verb stem seems to be lacking. Note the Zan action nouns bazua- (Megr.), which can mean also 'to pounce' (cf. Kipsidze 1914;199), and o-baz-u (Laz). The correspondence Georg, e ~ Zan a in word-internal position is regular. According to Schmidt (1961: 150; 1962:97), the stem may be compared with biz- in Svan ma-biz 'replete' (seethe following entry). 1 1 Schmidt (ibidem).
CK *bez- : bz- 'to fill; to get full, sated': Georg, bez- 'to get sated'; Svan bz- 'to satiate'. Unattested in Old Georgian sources. In modern Georgian the verb is fixed in the Imeretian dialect: action noun bezva- (yionti 1984: 67).For Svan cf. action noun li—bz-e, its regular noun correlate biz 'surfeit, satiety', and u—bz—ad 'insatieblely'. The stem may underlie GZ *bz—ek- : bz-ik-.
| |'cf. Schmidt (1962: 150).
10



*betk
GZ *betk- 'to beat strongly': Georg, betk- 'to beat strongly'; Megr. batk'to beat strongly and continually'. Unattested in Old Georgian. The verb stem must be treated as a lexicalized form of the Common Kartvelian stem *petk- : ptk-. The shift p > b has perhaps a sound-symbolic function. | | Fähnrich (1985: 26).
GZ *bek- 'to trample down': Georg, bek-n- 'to trample down'; Megr. bak-.
Occurs in Old Georgian: ibekn velsa zeda...'(lhe horse) paweth in the valley' Job 39.21. Since the word-final n is here a personal ending its modern Georgian continuant known from the Western dialects (cf. yionti 1984: 67) shows an extension. Cf. also its derivative bak-un- 'footfall, tramp' (Neisser 1953: 30). The action nouns are Georg, bekna-, Megr. bakua-. According to Schmidt (1962: 96), Deeters perceived their cognate in the Svan li—bek 'to press close'. 1 1 Fähnrich (1985: 26).'
CK *ber- 'to blow; inflate, distend': Georg, her- 'to blow, inflate, distend'; Megr. mbar-, bar-; Laz bar-; Svan bei- 'to be troubled with wind'. The verb stem occurs in Old Georgian texts: stahbera mat da hrkua... '(he) breathed on them and said...' Jn. 20.22, cf. also Abulaje 1973: 31, 501). The Zan action nouns are Megr. barua-, barapa- and Laz o-bar-u. The Svan cognate (action noun li—bel—e) points to old vowel length. In view of the deviating stem-final consonant in Svan the protoform is somewhat conjectural. An alternative reconstruction *bäl— (Vogt 1939; 133) can, however, hardly be proved. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103, 107). Laz: Schuchardt (1902.2: 399). Svan: Vogt (ibidem).
CK *berg— 'to hoe': Megr. barg- 'to hoe'; Laz berg—; Svan berg-. A verbal stem unattested in Georgian. It reflects an agricultural economy of ancient Kartvelians. The action nouns are Megr. bargua—, Laz o-berg—u, Svan li-berg-e. The Laz cognate underwent impact from the parallel noun stem berg- 'hoe'. Marr (1936: 382) thought that the Zan word has been borrowed from Svan. Similarity to the continuants of PIE *bherg-, bhreig- 'to break up, crush' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 167) is worth noting. | | Gamqrelise-Macavariani (1965: 162).
11



*ber-w-a
GZ *ber-w-a 'blowing': Georg, berva- 'blowing, whiif'; Megr. barua-, Laz barua-, barva-, bavra- 'wind'.
The action noun is well attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 31). It shows the thematic extension -(a)w and the action noun affix -a. Antiquity of this form is indicated by the existence of the secondary Zan forms of the action noun: cf. Megr. bar-ap-a-, Laz o-bar-u.
GZ *bertq- 'to beat out; shake': Georg, bertq- 'to shake (large objects); knock out'; Megr. bartq-. Verb stem found also in Old Georgian. The action noun is bertqa-, ganbertqa- (cf. Abula3e 1973: 31, 51). It continues the full grade of Georg.-Zan *pertq— : prtq. Georgian noun bartq— 'nestling' shows an apophonic word-formation from the verb stem (cf. also *bar$-). | | Fähnrich (1985: 26).
CK(?) *berqen- 'wild pear; wild plum(-tree)': Georg. b(e)rqena- 'wild pear'; Svan barqwen(d), bärqen 'wild plum(-tree)'. Phonetic irregularities make this equation somewhat problematic. Final Georg, -a must be a diminutive affix. In the Zan branch no cognate is found. A connection with Georg, tqemal- and its Zan correspondence (cf. Cikobava 1938: 126) is hardly demonstrable. According to Schmidt (1960: 135), the Svan form may be a Georgian loanword. | | USKJa: 54.
CK *berq- 'leg, step': Georg, pex- 'leg'; Megr. [box-]; Svan berq, bä(r)q, bäq 'step'.
The word is amply reflected by perq— in Old Georgian: qeli sent anu perqi... 'thy hand or foot...' Mt. 18.8; cf. also sa-brq-e, sa-prq-e 'trap, net'. The modern Georgian variants/»eg— and berq— have a dialectal use. In the Zan languages one extracts its stem from Megr. la—box—u 'passage in wattle-fence'. For Svan cf. also na-barq- 'track, foot-print'. 1 1 Cf. Topuria (1979: 93).
GZ *bev- : by- 'to be enough, suffice': Georg, [bey-] 'to suffice, be enough'; Megr. bay-; Laz bay-: [by-].
The verb stem survives in Georgian in the deverbal derivative *bey-el'barn' and in *bey—ur— 'sparrow'. Both grades of vowel alternation are apparently reflected in the Laz forms, which underwent a lexical separation of o-bay-u 'to suffice' and o-by-u 'to pour, fall' (the semantic
12



*bey-el
deviation of the latter may be due to the contamination with the continuants of Common Kartvelian *reyw- : ryw- 'to pour').
GZ *bey-el- 'barn, storehouse': Georg, bey-el- 'barn, storehouse'; Megr. bayu-; Laz bayu-.
A nominal formation from the verb stem *bey— : by— 'to be enough, suffice', attested in Old Georgian by its derivative me-beyle-e- 'houseserf' (Sar^velase 1995: 112). It represents one of the characteristic Georgian-Zan isoglosses reflecting the developed agricultural stage of the ancient Kartvelians (scarcely to be equated with Svan bye—, baye— 'pit, hole'). The historical position of dialectal Georg, beyo— remains unclear. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895: XII,113). Laz: Marr (1910: 10).
GZ *bey-ur- 'sparrow': Georg, beyura- 'sparrow'; Megr. bayare-, bayire-.
Unattested in Old Georgian. The word is related to *bey-el- or *beyo-(?) 'barn, storehouse'. This finds support in parallel correlations found in some other languages. The Georgian form contains the diminutive affix —a.
1 1 Kipsidze (1914: 201).
GZ *bec- 'to move by touch, grope': Georg, bee- 'to sneak, slink'; Megr. bac- 'to steal on tiptoe, grope'. Verb stem found in medieval Georgian sources. It seems to be symbolic in origin. Georgian has a nominal correlate bee- 'blind'. The Megrelian action noun is bacua-, bacap-\ aca-baca- is a Megrelian epithet of the jackal. Cf. Georg.-Zan *barbac- 'to reel, stagger'. Svan bembec- 'dark' may be also related. The stem conforms to the Caucasian area norm: cf. Avar becc-a-b 'blind, dark', Bezh. boc-dijo 'blind' (Fähnrich 1988: 36). \\OSKJa: 51.
GZ *be3g- 'to push, shove': Georg. [be$g-] 'to push, shove (with hand, shoulder)': Laz ba$g- 'to lean (on,against)'. Unattested in Old Georgian. In modern Georgian the stem is reflected in its regular noun correlate bi$g- 'push, bump' (see *bi$g-). In Laz its equivalent is preserved in its unbound form: cf. action noun do-ba^g-u
'to lean on earth' and ba^gei—ba^gei 'leaning (on), pushing off'
(ge—g—o—ba^g-am tread on your foot').
13



GZ(?) *be3,y- 'to scold, rail; be angry': Georg, bezy- 'to slander, denounce'; Megr. ber$y-el- 'to yell, howl; make a hubbub'; Laz be$y- 'to scold; be angry'. The identity in vocalism probably points to the onomatopoetic nature of the stem, although Zan e instead of expected a can be due to some other factor. The Megrelian form has a secondary word-formation suffix. Cf. also the Laz action noun o-be$y-in-u. The meaning of the Georgian stem causes some difficulties.
CK *be£- : bii- 'to crumble, break': Georg, [bic-] 'to crumble'; Svan beckw-, bickw-, bckw- 'to break (bread, apple, etc.)'. The verb stem may be extracted from Old Georgian participial derivatives na—bic— II na—bic—ev— 'crumb' (cf. Abulaje 1973: 316). According to Deeters (1955: 31) here belongs also bic- 'boy, fellow' (in Old Georgian - 'illegitimate child'), compared by Acaryan (1971: 451) with Arm. bic with the latter meaning. No certain cognates are found in the Zan languages. The Svan stem shows a vowel alternation: beckw- (intrans.), bckw- (trans.) are stems of an action noun.
| | SSKJa: 52.
CK *be|- : b|- 'to lean (on); rest (against)': Georg. [b$-] 'to lean (on); rest (against)'; Megr. bigg-; Laz be$g-; Svan [b$g-\. The verb stem is reflected in Georgian in the derivative b$-en- : b$—in— 'to lean (on)', in Svan —in the derivative b^g—en—. The vocalic shape of Georgian, Megrelian, and Svan forms reflects the zero grade of the ablaut alternation. The vowel e of the Laz form needs explanation. Cf. also the noun correlates *ba(r)$- and *bi$-.
GZ *bzar— 'to crack': Georg, bzar— 'to crack'; Megr. [zor— ]. Verb stem attested in the Old Georgian action noun dabzarva-, dab^arva- (Abulaje 1973: 105, 106). Georg, bzar- 'crack, split' is its noun correlate. In Megrelian the stem may be traced through the secondary verbal base zior- (action noun ziorua— 'to crack'). For an analogical correlation see *kan— *kian-, on the one hand, and *xar- ~ *xiar-, on the other. These examples raise the question of the functional value of i in such cases. | | Gudava (1979: 84).
14



*bz-ek- : bz-ik
GZ *bz-ek- : bz-ik- 'to stretch, pull out': Georg, bzek- : bzik- 'to stretch, pull out'; Megr. zik- 'to become numb; harden'. For the extension see *-ek : -(i)k. The Georgian action noun is bzeka-. The Megrelian stem (action noun zik-in-, go-zik-in-apa-) underwent reanalysis: cf. go-zik-ondu 'he became numb // died' alongside 1 pers. sing, go-b-zik-ondi became numb'.
CK *bzu- 'to hum, buzz': Georg, bzu- 'to hum, buzz'; Megr. buz-in'pedere'; Laz buz—al—; Svan bzü—I— 'to hum, buzz'. The stem shows a characteristic onomatopoeia (cf. *zmu—, *ymu-, *ckmu—), setting Kartvelian apart from North Caucasian languages. Cf. its elements shared with *buz(w)- 'fly' and Arm. bazzel 'to hum, buzz'. The Zan variants contain a recent affixation. The Svan action noun is li-bzul—i. According to Deeters (1954: 329), Georg, bzukuna— 'kind of fly' and bzik- 'wasp' are its derivatives (the latter has an extra-Kartvelian onomatopoeic analogy in Russ. bzyk and Pol. bzik 'gadfly').
\\ESKJa\5\.
GZ *bibil- 'shoots, sprouts; edge': Georg, bibilo- 'comb, crest, tuft (of bird)'; Megr. birbil— 'catkin, amentum (of tree, tambourine)'; Laz bibil'comb (of cock)'. A word perhaps of descriptive origin. The Megrelian correspondence as well as dialectal Georg. (Gur.) birbilo- shows reduplication. Final o in the Georgian form is secondary. Svan bimbil— 'comb, crest (of bird)' derives from the Georgian word. | Georgian, Megrelian: Cikobava (IKE VI: 45). Laz: ESKJa: 51.
CK *biga- 'stick, cudgel': Georg, biga- 'cross-beam (wooden) '; Megr. biga- 'stick'; Laz biga-; Svan bi$. A wide-spread dialectal word in Georgian (cf. yionti 1984: 73). For the Zan form see Cikobava (1938: 137). In Svan it shows the shift g > 3, known from a number of other cases: cf. *gab- : gb-, *gwel-, *gusl- : gs^-, etc. | | Klimov (1973: 361).
GZ *bir- 'to entice, lure': Georg, bir- 'to entice, lure'; Megr. bir-. Well documented in Old Georgian sources: kualad yayadebdes-ve birebita... 'they cried out again (with incitation) ...' Mk. 15.13. Action nouns are Georg, bireba- and Megr. birapa-. I I ESKJa: 52.
15



GZ *bi3g- 'push, bump': Georg. bi$g- 'push, bump (by the hand, shoulder); impulse'; Megr. [bi$g-]. It is a regular apophonic noun formation based on the verb stem *be$g- (cf. *bi$- , *pirtw-, *cxir-, *ckir-, *cir- etc.). In modern Georgian the word has a connotation 'impulse, stimulus'. In Megrelian its cognate may be extracted from the secondary action noun bi$g-ap- 'to push, shove'.
CK *\A%- 'step, support': Georg. bi$- 'step'; Megr. bigg- 'support, prop'; Svan bigg 'step'. Attested mainly in Old Georgian (cf. Abulaje 1973: 32). For modern Georgian prefixed na-bi$- 'step' is more usual. The lexeme belongs to a series of apophonic deverbative formations with vowel / being based on *be$- : b$- 'to lean (on), rest (against) sth.'. Cf. the analogous wordformation type in *bi$g-, *pirtw-, *cxir-, *cir-, etc.
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: USKJa: 52. Svan: Fähnrich (1982: 34).
GZ *blagw- 'blunt, obtuse': Georg, blagv- 'blunt, obtuse'; Megr. lug-aObtuse, stupid'. Attested in Georgian medieval literature as a verbal base (cf. Rustaveli 1604.4). The sound correspondences are regular: for loss of the initial b in the Megrelian consonant cluster cf. *bger-, *bz-ek : bz-ik, *blikw-, *byun-; for analogous vowel correspondences see *maqw-, *kacw-, etc. The Megrelian lexeme has a word-forming suffix -a. 1 1 Klimov (1988: 20).
GZ *blanc- 'kind offern': Georg, [blenc-] 'kind offern'; Laz bilonca'forest fern'. The Georgian stem can be extracted from the derived formation belnc-nar-a-, mentioned by S. Orbeliani (cf. the affixal -nar). The vocalic shape of cognates points to an original vocalism a. There is some doubt about a Kartvelian origin of the term. 1 1 A. Tandilava. Cf. Penrixi-Sarjvelase (1990: 56).
GZ(?) *bukw- 'fist': Georg, blikv- 'fist'; Megr. /i/tv-, nikv-. The Georgian word is known also in the dialectal (Imer.) form blikv(cf. yionti 1984: 77). In the Megrelian cognate the initial consonant sequence is simplified (cf. the two preceding entries). A borrowing from Georgian is not excluded.

*bod
GZ *bod- 'to rave': Georg, bod— 'to rave'; Megr. bond—; Laz bod— 'to rave; to dart in trouble (of a brood-hen)'. Unattested in Old Georgian. The action nouns are Georg, bodva-, Megr. bondua-, Laz o-bod-u. In Georgian the stem has also the meaning 'to roam'. Such semantic syncretism finds its analogies elsewhere: cf. PIE *bhred(h)- : bhrod(h)- (Pokorny 1959: 164). Apparently a symbolic stem: cf. its root vowel ο and obvious connection with Georg, abda-ubda- 'nonsense, incoherent babble'. Cf. similar Megrelian extended forms of the stem bord—is— with the same meaning.

CK *bokw- 'stump, stub': Georg, bokv- 'stump'; Megr. buk- 'stump, block'; Svan bik 'stump'. In modern Georgian the word has a dialectal use. No certain cognate is found in Laz. The Megrelian form shows the change *o > u next to labial consonant. The vowel i in the Svan equivalent derives from *«, as a result of umlaut. For another explanation of the Svan word see Abaev (1958: 260).
1 1 USKJa: 52.
GZ *borbal- 'spider': Georg, borbala- 'spider'; Megr. bo(r)bolia-\ Laz bombula—.
In standard Georgian the word has practically been replaced by the continuant of *obob(a)-, with which it may be connected. Contrary to the Laz form with *o>u next to a labial, Megrelian does not show this development, possibly because of a symbolic coloring of this lexeme. All words are extended by word-forming affixes. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 112-113). Georgian: USKJa: 53.
GZ *br- 'to twirl, whirl': Georg, [br-] 'to twirl, whirl'; Megr. [bur-]. Verb stem unattested in an unbound state. It is extracted from Georg.Zan *brun- and survives also in Georgian in the form bru- 'spinning, turbulence'. Sometimes one assumes a connection with the Georgian designation of the wheel borbal- (cf. Schmidt 1962: 98).
CK *br— 'to sing': Megr. bir— 'to sing, play'; Laz bir—', Svan br— 'to sing'. Action noun - Megr. bir-apa-, Laz o-bir-u, Svan (Lasx.) li-br-jal-i. There is no certain correspondence in Georgian. The Zan and Svan

*brag-un
material reflects a zero-grade vocalism of the stem. Cf. also Svan la-brjal 'singing'. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 254). Svan: USKJa: 53.
GZ *brag-un- 'crash, din': Georg, brag-un- 'crash, din'; Megr. burg-on- 'hollow crash'. A derivative from Common Kartv. *breg- 'to knock, strike' with an apophonic alternation and derivatory suffix -un. The root in Megrelian shows a regular transformation. For the analogous change see *parx-un-, *pacx-un-, *pact-un-. A tie-in with *brg- 'to wrestle, struggle' seems very doubtful. ||Caraia(1918:499).
CK *brg- 'to wrestle': Georg. br$- 'to wrestle, fight'; Megr. bur$- 'to wrestle, grapple (roughly), turn, toss'; Svan barg- 'to wrestle'. Verb stem well known in Old Georgian (msaxurni igimca cemni hbrgodes... 'then would my servants fight...' Jn. 18.36). The action nouns are Georg. br$-ola-, Megr. bur^-apa-, Svan li-bdrg-el, li-barg-jel. Relation to Zan burgul- 'knee' seems uncertain. For the Georgian-Zan stage an intermediate form *br^-, reflected in correspondence Georg. 3 ~ Zan 3, must be posited. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Deeters (1926: 51). Svan: Schmidt (1962: 99). AlsoASKJa: 53.
GZ *brdv-wn- 'to pluck (bird)': Georg. b(r)dyvn- 'to pluck (bird)'; Megr. burdyon-; Laz burdyol-, bundyol-.
A denominal verb stem derived with the suffix *-wn from *burdya'down, feathering'. By known consonant alternation it is related to Georg.-Zan *burtq-wn-. The Laz cognates reveal a secondary shift n> 1. | | USKJa: 54.
GZ *brdyw-en- 'to growl, grumble': Georg, brdyven- : brdyvin- 'to growl, grumble'; Megr. burdyin- 'to growl, mutter'; Laz bundyin- 'to grumble, snap'. A verb stem attested in Old Georgian: mis zeda ibrdyuendes lomni... 'lions have roared... at him...' ler. 2.15; action noun brdyuena-, which also meant 'to menace' (Sar3vela3e 1995: 17). Cf. also Georgian formations with a different suffix burdy-un-, burtq-un- 'grumbling'. The
18



*breg
Zan forms illustrate an intra-Zan correspondence r ~ n. According to Kipsidze (1914: 244) Megr. burdyuna- is a taboo designation of the bear.
| | USKJa: 54.
CK*breg- 'to strike, knock; make a noise': Georg, breg- : brig- 'to strike (softly)'; Laz brang-al- 'to strike (with feet)'; Svan breg- 'to strike, knock'. Apparently unattested in Old Georgian. The Laz cognate (cf. action noun o—bra(n)g—al—u, bragalaps 'he strikes with feet') contains secondary n. For Svan cf. breg-n-i 'he strikes, knocks' and its nominal correlate brig- 'knock, noise'. Cf. its derivative *brag-un-. A connection with Common Kartv. *brg- 'to wrestle' can hardly be accepted.
GZ *brtq-el- 'flat': Georg, brtqel- 'flat'; Megr. birtqa- 'flat (and rounded)'. Adjective derived with suffix *-el from verb stem *pertq- : prtq-. Therefore it presupposes an intermediate form *prtq-el-. Cf. the Georgian dialect variants p(r)tqel-, tqrpel-. The initial voiced consonant, attested already in Old Georgian (Sarjvelaje 1995: 17), is secondary (cf.also the Megrelian derivative la-partq-ia 'flat'). For the derivatory suffix see *gr$-el-, *wrc^-el-, *purcl-el-, *clit-el-, *clrp-el-t *qm-el-.
GZ *brtq-wn- 'to pluck (bird)': Georg. b(r)tqvn- 'to pluck (bird)'; Megr. bur'tqon-.
An evident parallel formation to *brdy-wn- with the same meaning. It seems to be secondary compared with the latter. Cf. the correlated noun stem *burtql- 'down and plumage'. | | Fähnrich (1982: 34).
GZ *brim— 'to spin, whirl': Georg, brun— 'to spin, rotate'; Megr. burin'to throw with spinning; to whirl'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian by action noun brunva- and its derivative dambrunebel- 'rotating' (Penrixi-Sarlvelaje 1990: 58). Cf. Megr. action noun burinua— (burin— < *birun-) and burin—burinit 'like a whirlwind'. The forms presuppose an underlying base *br-. ||Caraia(1918:499).
19



*brcaml
GZ *brcaml- 'pomegranate (small)': Georg, brcaml- 'pomegranate (small)'; Megr. [burcumol—}', Laz purcum(b)ol—, burcumol—.
The word occurs in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 36). In Georgian it has sometimes a meaning 'cultivated pomegranate'. A regular Megrelian cognate can be seen in the West Georgian dialect word burcumela(cf. yionti 1984; 95) which shows the secondary suffix. | | Gigineisvili (1982: 120). Cf. Marr (1915.1 II: 830; III: 938).
CK *bude- 'nest': Georg, bude- 'nest'; Megr. bude-; Svan bud-, bid'vulva'. The word is widely attested in Old Georgian texts (da ikmnian budej twisi... 'and make their nest...' Sin. mr. 225.9), where its derivatives are also present. In Georgian and Zan nouns the identity of the final vowel is regular. For Svan the transition u > ü > i is due to the umlaut effect. 54.
CK *buz(w>- 'fly': Georg, buz- 'fly'; Laz [buz-]', Svan buz-ul. In Old Georgian variant buzu- (Abula3e 1973: 37) is known. The word has an onomatopoeic origin: cf. *bzu- 'to hum, buzz'. The Laz correspondence is found in ma-buz-al-e-, ma-puz-al-e- 'wagtail', purz'gadfly'. The Svan form contains a diminutive suffix (reflecting the former word-final w).
CK *bur- 'to muffle up, wrap up; darken': Georg, bur- 'to muffle up; darken'; Megr. bur- 'to patch up, darn'; Laz bur- 'to patch up'; Svan bur- 'to darken'.
The action noun is Georg, da-burva-, Megr. burua—, Laz o—bur—u, Svan li-bwr-e. The stem is attested with its derivatives in Old Georgian: dahbures tavsa '(they) blindfolded him' Lk. 22.64. Cf. Georg, daburuli tqe 'dense forest', Svan msbur- 'dark' (participle in prefix ms—).
| | ÜSKJa: 55.
GZ *burdya- 'down, plumage': Georg, burdya- 'down, plumage'; Megr. burdya- 'down, shaggy'; Laz bundya- 'down, plumage'. In Old Georgian texts the lexeme seems to be absent. The word underlies the Georgian-Zan denominative verb stem *brdy-wn-. It occurs mostly in Zan and to some extent in Georgian. Its firmness in the latter
20



*burtql
ensures a parallel functioning here of the verbal stem. The word illustrates the well-known intra-Zan correspondence Megr. r ~ Laz n. Any connection with arm. burd 'wool'? | | Cikobava (1938: 101).
GZ *burtql- 'down and plumage': Georg, burtql- 'down and plumage'; Megr. butqu- 'soft'; Laz bu(r)tqu- 'kind of insect'(?). The semantic deviation of the Laz form makes its inclusion somewhat doubtful. For correspondence Georg. / ~ Zan u in the word-final position cf. *opl-, *cqintl-. Svan bintqil- 'down' seems to be borrowed (though —17 might be a diminutive suffix). | | OSKJa: 55.
GZ *burc!X- 'kind of weed': Georg, burcxala- 'kind of weed'; Megr. burcx-, Laz bu(r)cx- 'kind of weed (Echinochloa crus galli)'. A tentative reconstruction. For Georgian the word is found in Imer. and Gur. dialects (yionti 1984: 94). Its Laz correspondence often lacks r. Georg, burcxa- seems to be borrowed from Zan source. Cf., however, Penrixi-Sar3vela3e (1990: 66), where the latter form is treated as a regular correspondence of the Zan words. (1987: 168-169)
GZ *bur3g— 'to bristle (up); ruffle': Georg bur$g—n— 'to bristle (up), ruffle'; Megr. bu§g-, bi$g-; Laz bu^g-in-.
Unattested in Old Georgian. The Zan action nouns are Megr. bu$guaand Laz o-bu^g-in-u. The stem may be treated as a denominative formation: cf. bur$g(a)- 'bristle'. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 256). Georgian: Klimov (1973: 361).
GZ *bur3ga- 'bristle': Georg. bur$gal- 'pile'; Megr. bu^ga- 'needles of chestnut'. Georgian-Zan archetype. Identity of the vowel a presupposes secondarity of / in Georgian form. For similar development cf. *bark—, *kurcx-, *kupx-, *maqw-. Cf. also Georg. bu$g- 'little hedgehog' fixed by S. Orbeliani. The Laz equivalent seems to be lost. 1 1 Klimov (1973: 361)
GZ *butka- 'inflorescence, leaf: Georg, butko-, butk- 'inflorescence'; Laz butka- 'leaf.
21



*butk-ar
The word may be identified in Old Georgian through the derivative action noun gamobutkoeba 'to blossom': rtoni misni daccnian dapurceli gamobutkoin... 'when his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves...' Mt. 24.32. The Megrelian equivalent seems to be lost. The final vowel is reconstructed tentatively. In view of the derivative *butk-ar- 'bee' the original meaning must have been 'inflorescence'. Any connection with Arm.ptuk- 'bud, sprout' (cf. Acaryan 1979: 112)? 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 136).
GZ *butk-ar- 'bee': Georg.putkar- 'bee'; Laz butku^-. Derived from *butka- 'inflorescence, leaf with the suffix -or. It is attested also in Old Georgian: gamoavlinos upalman ...putkari 'Lord will whistle... for bees' Is. 7.18. The Megrelian cognate is lost, but can be traced back in Georg, (dial.) butkura- 'kind of wine in Ajaria' and in the place-name Butkuris— in West Georgia. Initial Georg, p derives from assimilation of b to tk. Marr (1912.1: 31) saw here a prefix pu— II bu—. According to Abaev (1988: 74), the word goes back to Old Iranian *madu-kara- 'honey-maker'. 1 1 Marr (1909: 071).
GZ *buq-wn- 'to eat (roughly), gorge': Georg, buqvn- 'to eat (roughly), gorge'; Megr. bu'on-. Verb stem containing derivative element *-wn. The root is evidently connected with a descriptive base buq—: cf. the Georgian reduplicated formation buqbuq- 'gurgle, rumbling, muttering'. | | Zyenti (1965: 39).
CK *bya(w>- 'to low, moo; to yell': Georg, byav- 'to low, moo'; Laz byo(r}-, mbyo(r}- 'to low, moo; to yell(?)'; Svan byu-. The stem shows an obvious onomatopoeia. In Old Georgian it may be extracted from mbyavan— 'cattle'. Cf. modern Georgian action noun byav-il—. Its Zan equivalent may be seen in Laz o—mbyor—u where r is probably due to contamination of this stem with o-myor—in—u 'to cry'. For Svan cf. action noun li-byül-i; qän byäw 'bull lows, moos'. Arm. byavel with the same meaning seems to be dependent on Kartvelian forms. | | Georgian, Svan: Kerkase (1974: 12).
GZ *bvwen- : bywn- 'to bend, curve': Georg, yun- 'to bend, curve'; Megr. yun-.
22



*bywen—k— :bywn—le
in Old Georgian sources occurs the more archaic form byun-: action noun byunva- (Abulase 1973: 38). Cf. Megrelian action noun yunua-. Much more dubious seems the comparison with Svan ywn-, extracted from u-ywn-a 'elbow', which coincides formally with a participle of absence of quality. The material presented here reflects a zero grade. For the full grade cf. derivative *bywen-k- : bywn-k-.
GZ *bywen-k- : bywn-k- 'to curve, twist': Georg, byunk- 'to curve'; Megr. ywank— 'to twist'. Undoubtedly connected with *bywen- : bywn-, -k being an enlargement (cf. *-ek : -(/)£)· Cognates reflect different grades of the vocalism. The Megrelian deverbative noun is yvank-al-. Svan li-byunk(w)-e with the same meaning must be a recent borrowing from Georgian.
GZ(?) *bywer- : bywr- 'to growl, look sternly': Georg, byver- 'to look sternly'; Megr. bury-in- 'to growl, grumble'. A problematic juxtaposition. Whereas Georgian reflects apparently the full-grade of the protoform, Megrelian retains its zero-grade. The latter underwent also a metathesis and was extended by a derivatory affix. The difference in meaning causes some difficulties.
GZ *byn-e3- : byn-|- 'to frown, grin': Georg, byneg- : byni^- 'to frown, grin'; Megr. yingg-. The verb stem is known in Georgian medieval texts (cf. Rustaveli 868.2) and can be viewed as derived from *bywen- : bywn- with a suffix -e$ : -(i)3. This represents an alternative interpretation of the history of the Megrelian stem given under * γτ-€$— : γτ—i^—. | | Gigineisvili (1979: 79-80).
GZ *b(y)u- Owl': Georg. bu(v)- Owl'; Laz byu-, mbyu-. A lexeme of obvious onomatopoeic origin, hardly separable from *yuwith the same meaning. In Old Georgian the word is attested in the form buv— (cf. Abulase 1973: 37). A connection with Arm. and Arab, bu seems unlikely. For analogous formations in other languages cf. PIE *bh(e)u(Pokorny 1959: 97), Chechen buha, Godob. buhu. | | Zyenti (1956: 62).
GZ *bck-wn- 'to nip, pinch': Georg, bckvn- 'to nip, pinch'; Megr. bickon—, biskon—.
23



*bg-en— : bg—in
Verb stem possibly connected with *perck- : prck- and *prcka'splinter, pip'. The action nouns are Georg, bckvna-, Megr. bickonua-. In Georgian a variant form brckvn- is found. No correspondence exists in Laz. For the reflex of the old suffix -wn in Zan cf. *brdy-wn-, *buq-wn-, *krt-wn-, *put-wn-, etc. ' |'| USKJa: 56-57.
CK *b|-en- : b|-in- 'to prop up; lean, rest': Georg, b^en- : b$in- 'to prop up; lean, rest'; Svan b$gen- : bggin-. Verb stem derived from the simple base *be$- : b$- with the help of the affix *-en : -in. Occurs in Old Georgian: tu poos kedeli ebr$inebodis... 'if finds a wall, will lean on it...' Krest. 303.26-27. In the Georgian stem a secondary r sometimes appears. The Svan action noun is li—b^gin-e. 1 1 USKJa: 5 7 .
G
CK *-g- pronominal base of unclear deictic function (cf. *a-k-, *e-g-, *-*-).
GZ *g- 'to build, construct': Georg, g- 'to build, construct'; Megr. g-\ LazgThe verb stem retains an identical shape (the action nouns - Georg. geba-, Megr. gapa-) in all languages. Its meaning reflecting a settled way of life also coincides. The absence of the stem in Svan deserves attention.
GZ *g- 'to string, thread; put through': Georg, g- 'to string, thread; put through'; Megr. g~. Contrary to Megrelian, where the verb stem is widely used (cf. marckindi... kitis komaages '(they) put on the finger ... the ring'), in Laz it seems to be absent. A connection with the verb stem in the preceding entry is not excluded.
GZ *g- 'to acquire, gain, win': Georg, g- 'to acquire, gain, win'; Megr. g-; Lazg- 'to win'.
24



*gab- : gb
Cf. action nouns Georg, mogeba-, Megr. mogapa-, Laz o-gap-u. The stem is well known in Old Georgian (nu moigebt okrosa... 'provide neither gold...' Mt. 10.9), where it had a great range of meaning. The Georgian aoristic word form of 3 pers. sing, moigo (< *mo-i-gv-a) 'he acquired, gained' may point to old u in the stem. The Laz equivalent has a narrower meaning. | | Cikobava (1938: 257).
CK *gab- : gb- 'to cook, boil': Georg, gb- 'to cook, boil'; Megr. gib-, gab- 'to boil a silk thread'; Laz gub-, gib-, $ib- 'to cook, boil'; Svan $ab- : $b- 'to cook'.
The zero-grade form is reflected in all languages: action nouns Georg, gboba-, Megr. gibua-, Laz o-gib-u, Svan li-^b-i. Full grade is retained in Georgian (cf. Raca dial, u-gab- - 'uncooked') and in Svan (cf. ms^äb 'cooked'). The stem is widely attested in Old Georgian (gbolvil- 'cooked', umgbar- 'not cooked, raw'), but in the modern language it is used only dialectally. Svan and the Atina dialect of Laz show the shift *g > j. The meaning 'to boil' may be a Georgian-Zan innovation. 1 1 Cf. Topuria (1979: 10).
CK *gaw-: gw- 'to resemble': Georg, gav- 'to resemble'; Megr. g-, gu-, Laz g—; Svan 3—es-, gw—.
The forms of 3 pers. singular are Georgian and Old Georg, gav—s, Megr. gu-n, Svan xa-$-es 'he resembles him'. Cf. the derived verb stem *gwan-. The Svan equivalent has an enlargement -es, whereas the root $ is a result of affricatization (cf. *gab- : gb-, *gwel-, *gusi- : gSi-). The original form is better reflected in Svan li-m-gw-i 'to liken'. Among Georgian derivatives cf. igav- 'parable, allegory' (analogous wordformation pattern see under *sar- : sr-). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cf. Topuria (1979: 10). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 258). Svan: Schmidt (1962: 99).
CK *gaw- : gw- 'to sweep': Georg, gav- : gv- 'to sweep'; Svan [ngäw
• ng-\
Occurs in Old Georgian: gangave saxli seni 'sweep your house', action noun gangva- (Abula3e 1973: 83). Cf. also nagev— 'litter' alongside modern Georg, na-gav- of the same meaning. In the Zan languages no certain cognates are found. The Svan match may be extracted from some

*gal- : gl
derivatives of the stem: cf. la—ngaw 'besom, broom' and le—ng—uli 'rubbish heap, dump'. | | Sardschweladse (1987: 18).
CK *gal- : gl- 'to tear, pick; to break, burst': Georg, gal- : gl- 'to tear, pick (to break, burst)'; Svan gl- (gil-) : gel-. Verb stem is well attested in Old Georgian: cf. the deverbative action noun dagla- (i-gal-a 'it burst, broke', past participle daglil-). For modern Georgian the derived stem gl-e$- : gl-i$- 'to tear, burst' is more common. Cf. the dialectal form of the action noun gla- (yionti 1984: 154). The Svan action nouns are li-gl-e (transitive, cf. gil-e 'he tears, breaks', na-gil 'piece, bit'), and li-gel (intransitive). The root shows nonfunctional vowel alternation a ~ e. \ \ Topuria (1942:971).
GZ *ga-mo- complex preverb of direction Outwards toward the speaker': Georg. ga~mo- preverb Outwards toward the speaker'; Megr. go—mo; Laz go—mo-.
An independent emergence in Georgian and the Zan languages cannot be excluded. The preverb is widely attested in Old Georgian: gamovida Abraham Egwiptit... 'Abraham went up from Egypt...' Gen. 13.1; gamoiqvanen igini cuenda... 'bring them out to us...' Gen. 19.5.
GZ *gan— 'side': Georg, gan— 'side; width, breadth'; Megr. \gon-]; Laz \gon-].
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian, where it had a wider semantic range (cf. Abula3e 1973:50): vitarca gani isrita... 'as a mark for his arrows...' Lament. 3.12. No direct cognates are found in the Zan languages. Cf. the preverb *ga(n)\ | OSKJa: 59.
GZ *ga(n)- preverb of direction Outside, outwards': Georg. ga(n)preverb Outside, outwards'; Megr. go-; Laz go-. In Old Georgian the preverb had a final n (ukuetu ... ganvasxam esmakta... 'if I ... cast out devils...'Mt. 12.27) and had some additional meanings. In all modern languages it ends in vowel except in borrowed Old Georgian forms. The preverb is based on the preceding noun. Cf. R. Lafon(W)rd7, 1951; 236).

*gangl
GZ *gangl— 'to soil, dirty; get dusty': Georg, gangvl— 'to get dusty'; Megr. gingol- 'to soil, dirty'. In Old Georgian sources the verb stem is apparently unattested. The action nouns are Georg, gangvla- and Megr. gingolua-. Its vocalism remains unclear (a metathesis in the Megrelian cognate?). | | Sardschweladse (1985: 23).
GZ *ga(n)-£ed-il- 'hammered in, stuffed': Georg, gacedil- 'hammered in, stuffed'; Megr. gockadil—. Occurs in Old Georgian in the shape ofgancedil- (cf. Abulaje 1973: 80). It is a past participle in -// based on the verb stem *ced- 'to hammer in, nail' containing a preverb *ga(ri)-. Cf. also *ced-il-. | | Cf. Rogava (IKE XXVI 1987: 191).
GZ *gen- 'to make suck (calf before milking of cow)': Georg, gen- 'to make suck (calf before milking of cow)'; Megr. gan—. In modern Georgian the verb stem occurs in dialects (Gur., Imer). The action noun is genva-, the 3 person singular, genavs. Because of the regular sound correspondence with the Zan form the stem cannot have been borrowed from Megrelian: cf. the Megrelian action noun ganua-, aoristic 3 person singular - moganu. Its nominal counterpart is *gen'calf. The connection of the stem with the latter form first noted in Kipsidze (1914: 215). | | ESKJa: 59-60.
GZ *gen- 'calf (suckling)': Georg, gen- 'calf (suckling)'; Megr. gen-, gin-; Lazgen-, $en-, n$en-.
In modern Georgian it is a dialectal (Imer.) word. The Zan variants show vestigially umlaut from underlying *gan-, Laz n$en- is the most deviating form. *gen- in the preceding entry must be treated as a denominative verb stem. Attempts to connect the word with Svan yun 'calf are untenable. | | Megrelian, Laz:Cikobava (1938: 84).Georgian: ESKJa: 59-60.
GZ *gen— : gn— 'to hear, learn': Georg, gen— : gn—'to learn, recognize'; Megr. gin-, gan- 'to learn, understand'; Laz gn- 'to hear, learn'. The action nouns are Georg, migneba-, segneba-, Megr. ginapa-, Laz o-gn-u. In Old Georgian it occurs very seldom (cf. Abulase 1973: 94). Whereas the Georgian stem shows full and zero grade, the Zan forms
27



*gwal
reflect only the latter. In Megrelian it occurs rarely. Connection with Georgian-Zan *gon- seems to be illusory. Rarely occurring Svan mgsn(cf. mamgsna Ί consider, think') is apparently a borrowing from Georgian. The similarity to PIE. *gen-, gn - 'to know, recognize' stated in Bopp (1847: 78, 79) seems to be deceptive. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 262-263).
GZ *gwal- 'to be (of drought)': Georg, gval-, gol- 'to be (of drought)'; Megr. golop-.
Verb stem attested in Old Georgian: da esevitari ese gualvaj... 'and such a drought...' Sin. mrav. 67.37. Action noun Georg, gvalva-, Megr. golopa—, cf. golopans 'there is drought'. The Megrelian cognate underwent realignment by analogy with coropa— 'damp weather'. The resemblance to PIE (dial.) *gual- 'to flame, blaze' is noteworthy. | | Kipsidze (1914: 218).
CK(?) *gwal- 'to go': Georg, [gval-] 'to go'; Svan [gw l-, gwal-]. A problematic equation. In both languages the stem appears only in the imperative. Its Old Georgian shape is gwale\ 'go!'. Its Svan correlate is gwal! or gw le! An interjectional nature is not excluded. According to Topuria (cf. 1979: 69) the Svan form is a Georgian loanword. | | USKJa: 60.
CK *gwam— 'body, fore-part (of body)': Georg, gvam— 'corpse, cadaver'; Svangw m 'breast, fore-part of body'. Well attested in Old Georgian, where its meaning was 'body', changed later: cf. gamoitxowa guami lesujsi... '(he) begged the body of Jesus' Mt. 27.58. In the Zan languages no certain cognates are found. 1 1 Marr (1915.1: 850). Cf. also Deeters (1957: 384).
CK *gw-an- 'to resemble': Georg, gvan- 'to resemble'; Svan $on-. Verb stem derived with the enlargement *-an from *gaw- : gw- of the same meaning, known also in Old Georgian: cf. action noun segvaneba- 'to resemble', seugvanebel- 'improper, unsuitable'. No certain cognate appears in the Zan languages. Its regular Georgian noun correlate is gvar- 'kin, clan, kind'. For the alternation n ~ r in such pairs cf. *zywan- vs. *zywar-, *sl\ven- vs. *8λ\νβΓ-, *qan- vs. *qar-, and others. | | Deeters (1930: 28). Cf. Topuria (1979: 10).

*gwar- : gwr
CK *gwar- : gwr- 'to lead, conduct': Georg, gvar- 'to lead, conduct'; Svan gwr- 'to lead (cattle on pasture)'. Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian texts (gamohguara lesu gare... '(he) led Jesus away...' Jn. 19.13), where both ablaut grades were still in use. The verb apparently was combined with direct objects denoting animate beings. For Svan cf. action noun li-gwr-i. 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 33).
CK *gwel- 'snake': Georg, gvel- 'snake'; Megr. gver-; Laz mgver-; Svan hi$w- : u$—, (h)wi$— : 113-.
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian: gueli nu miscesa masl 'will he give him a serpent?' Mt. 7.10. For the identity of the sequence ve in Georgian and Zan nouns see *gwerd-, *wer$i-, *mtwer— and some others. Whereas in Laz the lexeme occurs rarely, in the Upper Bal dialect of Svan it has been entirely replaced by hercam (hwi$ means here 'grasssnake'). The vowel u characterizes in Svan forms of the plural, whereas i - forms of the singular. In both cases a tendency of the labial element to metathesize is evident. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 28). Laz: Deeters (1926: 67). Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 10).
GZ *gwerd- 'side, flank': Georg, gverd- 'side, flank'; Megr. gverd
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian where it also meant 'rib': da staqade guerdsa cemsa... 'and thrust it into my side...' Jn. 20.27. In modern Georgian it has a dialectal variant görd- (yionti 1984: 159). Among its derivatives are Old Georg, i—gurd—iv 'near, side by side', Megr. gorda- 'curved, crooked', Laz o-gverd-u 'to halve', etc. Svan gsrdil-, kartil- (Upper Bal) are loanwords. For the semantics cf. Finn.puoli 'side, half'. ||Marr(1909:070).
GZ *gwimra- 'fern': Georg, gvimra— 'fern'; Megr. gvimora—. Unattested in Old Georgian. Word-final a and sonant r are reflected regularly in both languages. In Megrelian expected > next to the labial. Megr. gvimara-, gumara- as well as Svan gwimbra, gvvrimb seem to be borrowed from Georgian. Cf. Penrixi-Sargvelage (1990: 80). Cf. *blanc-.

*gz
GZ(?) *gz- 'to kindle, set fire': Georg, gz-, gzn- 'to kindle, set fire'; Megr. rz-; Lazgz-, z-.
The verb stem is well attested in Old Georgian: ayagznes cecxli... 'they had kindled a fire...'Lk. 22.55. Action nouns are Georg, gzneba-, gzeba—, Megr. rzama-, Laz o-gz—u. Cf. also Georg. muguz(al)— 'charred log', guzguza cecxli 'flaming fire,'. The element « in the Georgian stem is secondary. In the Megrelian equivalent rz derives from gz (cf. *gza—). The Laz stem sometimes loses its g and shows a change g > 3. May Arm. kizel 'to kindle' be dependent? 1 1 Deeters (1930: 61).
GZ *gza- 'way, path': Georg, gza- 'way, path'; Megr. za~ (Plur. zal-); Laz (n)gza—.
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian: parto ars gzaj... 'broad is the way...' Mt. 7.13. It is a typical isogloss setting Georgian-Zan apart from Svan. Megrelian final / of the plural must be a secondary element removing hiatus. For the change gz > rz in Megrelian see the preceding entry. Cf. also derivative *(s)a-gz-al-. A comparison with Svan Ιϊ-z-i 'to go' remains disputable. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 33). Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 57).
GZ *gl-es- : gl-is- 'to smear, spread': Georg, gles- : glis- 'to smear, spread'; Megr. gilos-. Verb stem known from Old Georgian: action noun is gan-gles-a (Abulase 1973: 53).Apparently it contains an enlargement *-es : -is, attested also in *mc^q-es- : mc^q-s- 'to pasture', *sr-es- : sr-is- 'to rub'. For the root cf. Georg, gl-u- 'slippery'. Megrelian has the phonetic variants gilors— and gilorc— with a meaning 'to wheedle'. The Megrelian correspondence reflects a protoform with a. | | F hnrich (1985: 26).
GZ *gl-e$- : gl-i|- : gl-$- 'to tear, to break': Georg. gle$- : gl-i$- : g(l)$- 'to tear, break'; Megr. gur^-on-. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 94, 106).It is derived from *gal- : gl- with an extension -e^ : -i$. Cf. action noun glega- and dial. (Imer.) dag^oma-. Through sound symbolism it is connected with *ql-ec- : ql-ic- : qlc-. The Megrelian cognate has a secondary extension -on (< *-w«?). The expected cluster £g does not

GZ *glo(w)- 'to grieve, deplore': Georg, glov- 'to grieve, deplore'; Megr. rg(v)-.
Found in Old Georgian sources (cf. Abulase 1973: 94). Action noun Georg, glova-, Megr. rguala-, rgueba-. Beside metathesis the Megrelian stem underwent a change / > r in the cluster; final v disappears before the suffixal -u (cf. gemikirgu 'he deplored'). The suffixal nature of -ow is difficult to prove (cf. Vogt 1947.1: 57). Is Svan li-gwn-i 'to weep' related? | | USKJa: 63.
GZ *gon- 'to think, remember': Georg, gon- 'to think, remember, hear'; Megr. go«—; Laz (n)gon— 'to think, remember'. The verb stem widely used in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 95). Cf. action noun - Georg, goneba—, Megr. mogonua—, Laz o—ngon—u. Note also Georg, gon- 'reason, mind'. The Laz form usually has an initial n. A connection with the verb stem *gen- : gn- 'to hear, learn' seems improbable both on formal and semantic grounds. The relationship with Svan gn- (cf. li-gn-ew-i 'to think up, inspire') remains unclear. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 262-263).
CK *gor- : gr- 'to roll, wallow': Georg, gor- 'to roll, lie about'; Megr. gorgol—; Laz ngor-, gr-; Svan gwr—, gur—.
Verb stem well known from Old Georgian: gorvida da perooda 'he fell on the ground, and wallowed, foaming' Mk. 9.20 (action noun gorveba-). The Old Georgian variant ngor- (cf. ngorebul- 'wallowing') yields a parallel to the Laz form. In the Zan languages two ablaut grades are present. Cf. Laz action nouns o-ngor-u 'to roll' and o-rg-in-u 'to twist, roll (trans.)'. Besides the Megrelian correspondence is reduplicated. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 263-264). Svan: Marr (1911-1914: 596).
GZ *gora- 'mount, hill': Georg, gora- 'mount, hill'; Megr. gola-, gvala-; Laz gola- 'summer roaming place'. The word is attested in Old Georgian: ayqda gorasa ertsa... 'climbed on the mount..'. Kartl. ex. 10.11. In the Zan cognate r seems to have been transformed into / under the influence of the derived adjective golur- (<

*gr
*gor-ur-) 'mountainous, mountaineer', where two r would have been inadmissible. The Megrelian dialectal (Sam.) form shows a change ο > να (cf. *qana-).
| | Georgian, Megrelian: Dzanasvili (1902: 9). Laz: USKJa: 64.
CK *gr- 'to lay eggs': Georg, gr- 'to lay eggs'; Svan gr-. The verb stem represents a lexicalized zero-grade form of the preceding stem. The stem is attested only in Old Georgian (action noun groba-; magrobal- 'layer') and Svan (action noun li-gr-e; cf. also la-gr-e 'egg'). 1 1 USKJa: 64.
CK *grgw- 'round artefact, ring': Georg. [(g)rgv-] 'round artefact'; Megr. [rgv-]; Laz [rgv-]; Svan girg-od 'ring on wicket'. The stem forms the basis of a number of derivatives. Cf. *grgw-in-, *m—grgw—al—, *mo—rgw-, *grk—al—. The Svan form seems to have developed from *grgw—ad—. This stem reflects a Caucasian area norm of the onomatopoeia (cf. Avar gurg-in-ab, Chechen gorga 'round').
CK(?) *grgw-in- 'to thunder': Georg, grgvin- 'thunder'; Megr. gurgin-, gvirgvin-; Laz girgin-; Svan gurgwn-C?).
Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian: da ikmnebodes ... grgvinvani 'and there was thundering' Kartl. ex. 112. A derivative from *grgwwith the suffix -in. For the Zan languages cf. action noun Megr., Laz gurg-in-. Less clear is the affix of the Svan form (action noun li—gurgwn—ι).

GZ *gr-ex- : gr-ix- 'to roll, twist': Georg, grex- : grix- 'to roll, twist'; Megr. girax— : girix—; Laz ngrix—.
Traceable in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 96). The verb stem is a derivative from *gor- : gr-. For the word-forming affix *-ex : -ix see *c\n-ex-. The Megrelian stem has variants: cf. action noun giroxua-, kiroxua- which points to the parallel archetype *gr-ax-. The Laz action noun is o-ngrix—u.

32



*grk-al
The word has been found in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 96, 473). It is a past participle based on *grex- : grix- with the affix *-i7.
GZ *grk-al- 'ring, hoop': Georg, rkal- 'hoop, ring'; Laz [kirkol-]. Traceable in Old Georgian in the shape ofgrkal- (Abulase 1973: 96). Cf. the East Georgian dialect forms kirkal- and krikal (yionti 1984: 293, 310). The Zan equivalent can be found in the verb o-kirkol-u 'to curl, twist'. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1987:19).
CK(?) *gr3~ 'to be long, to be high': Georg, gr$- 'to prolong, continue'; Megr. [gi/i£]; Svan [gj-, gz-]. Without further affixation the stem is found only in Georgian: cf. gan-a-gr$-o 'he continued'. In other languages it is extended by different word-forming elements: action nouns - Megr. gin$orua, Svan . Cf. the derivative *gr$-el-.
GZ *gr3-el- 'long, high': Georg. g(r)$el- 'long'; Megr. g3r$a-//e-, gir$e-, gan^a-lle-, Laz gin$e-, gun$e- 'long, high'.
Adjective derived from the verb stem *gr$-. It is widely attested in Old Georgian (gr^el qvian pesuebi... 'they make broad their phylacteries...' Mt. 23.5), where its meaning 'high' can also be found. The original r gives regular reflexes in all languages. Cf. also the intra-Zan correspondence Megr. r (> n) ~ Laz n. The Zan forms ending in e require an explanation. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895; XII, 113). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 229).
CK *grcq-il- 'flea': Georg. (r)cqil- 'flea'; Megr. cqir-, cqar-; Laz mckifr)-, mcir-; Svan zisq, zasq.
The most archaic shape of this word has been preserved in Old Georgian grcqil- (cf. Xevs. gircqil-). Other forms underwent various simplifications. The Laz cognate has a secondary m. Initial z of the Svan correspondence remains entirely unclear (*gr >z?). There are other examples of the desaffrication of c in Svan. The word gives the impression of a derivative in -i7. | | Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 300). Megrelian: Caraya (1912: 25). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 116).

*gu
Not found in Old Georgian. S. Orbeliani cites grgya-. Cf. also Georgian dialectal (Gur.) rgya.- 'branchy prop' (yionti 1984: 458). The Megrelian word means also 'block'. According to Ja. G. Testelec (personal communication) the Georgian-Zan forms can be compared with the Svan word for 'tick'. Parallel words containing the voiceless consonants enable us to reconstruct also *krcxa-.
GZ *gu- 'to get accustomed, train': Georg. gu(v)- 'to get accustomed, train'; Megr. g(u)—; Laz g-. Verb stem allegedly attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 98, 473). The Zan forms represent its simplification: cf. alongside Megr. gitmu-v-a-gu-k Ί accustom', action noun Megr. ge-g-apa- andLaz o-g-ap-u. A connection with gul- 'heart' (cf. ilSKJa: 65) must be rejected. \ \ Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 258). Cf. USKJa: 65.
CK *guga- 'core, kernel': Georg, guga- 'pupil (of eye)'; Megr. gunga-, guga- 'core of the corn-cob'; Svan gwigw (Plur. gug-ar) 'core, kernel'. Attested in Old Georgian: vitarca gugaj tualisa... 'as the apple of (his) eye...' Deut. 32.10. Cf. also the Svan (Lasx.) gugw-. The semantic proximity of the forms is obvious. The word may be compared with PIE *guga- 'core, kernel' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 394).
CK *gugul- 'cuckoo': Georg, gugul- 'cuckoo'; Megr. gugul-, Laz gugul-; Svan gigu-.
Except for Georgian dialectal gugut(o)- (yionti 1994: 161) the Georgian-Zan forms are identical. The loss of the word-final / in Svan is regular. An onomatopoeic origin of the word needs no commentary. Hence it has numerous analogies in other linguistic families. | | Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (see Erckert 1895: 295). Megrelian, Laz: Kipsidze (1914: 219).
GZ *guda- 'leather bag, wineskin': Georg, guda- 'leather bag, wineskin'; Megr. guda—; Laz guda—.
Widely attested in Old Georgian: nuca gudaj moigot ... '(provide) nor scrip...' Mt. 10.10. Svan gudra- seems to be borrowed from some other Kartvelian language; it belongs to a series of formations in affixal -ra.We have here a cross-cultural term, borrowed from Indo-European (cf. Old

*gul
Indian guda-h 'intestines' < PIE *gudo-) and known also in Semitic languages (cf. Aram, gowdä 'leather bag for water'). 1 1 Marr (1915.1: 773).
CK *gul- 'heart, core': Georg, gul- 'heart, core'; Megr. gur-; Laz gur-, gu-; Svan gwi- : gu-, guh-.
Widely attested in Old Georgian: munca iqos guli tkueni... 'there will your heart be also...' Lk. 12.34 (derivatives guleba- 'intention', gulitad'true, devoted', gulis-tkuma- 'wish, desire'). The Zan forms show the expected change I > r. The loss of the final / and the umlaut effect are regular for Svan. In Svan poetry a form without umlaut occurs: eca malatd gu amcane 'love for her stole my heart' (Sv. P 344.2). | | Rosen (1845: 31; idem 1847: 408), Bopp (1846: 327).
CK *gusj- : gs,- 'to weave': Georg, ks- 'to weave'; Megr. rs(v); Laz s(v)-; Svan $is- : $$-.
The verb stem occurs in Georgian in bound forms: cf. Old Georg. ks-el- 'cloth, fabric', ks-ov-a- 'to weave'. A more archaic shape of the stem is preserved in Old Georgian sa-gus-al- 'warp'. The Georgian-Zan material undergoes changes gs > ks, on the one hand, and gs > rs II ks > s, on the other. Svan g > 3 (cf. action noun li—^s—i) is positionally regular. Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Caraya (1912: 25). Laz: cf. Topuria (1979: 16).
D
GZ *-da clitic of condition: Georg, -da 'if; Megr. -da; Laz -da. Basically the clitic is inherent in Georgian (cf. midis-da, cavides! 'if he leaves, let him leave!') and Megrelian. In Laz it occurs rarely (minon-da... 'if I wish...'). Identity of the final vowel is regular. A connection with the conjunction da (q.v.) seems plausible. | | USKJa: 68.
GZ *da 'and' (conjunction): Georg, da 'and'; Megr. do, ndo\ Laz do. Georgian-Zan conjunction. It is well attested in Old Georgian: da icqos guemad monata da mqevalta... 'and he then begins to beat the manservants and maidservants...' Lk. 12.45. Georg, a is regularly
35



*da
matched in the Zan languages by ο because of its usual proclitic position. Cf. also Zan compounds like Megr. vitosum < *vit-do-sum- 'thirteen'. 1 1 Cagareli (1880: 11). Cf. USKJa: 68.
GZ *da- preverb of direction 'down(wards) on surface': Georg, dapreverb 'downwards on surface'; Megr. do-; Laz do-, Georgian-Zan word-forming element. It is widely in use in Old Georgian: am daeca igi... 'it fell not...' Mt. 7.25; romelman daasxa venaqi... 'which planted a vineyard...' Mt. 21.33. Georgian preverb ca- pointing to direction of action inside and downwards had in Old Georgian the form sta- which derived from a combination of the preverbs *se- and *da-. The ancient vowel is appropriately rendered in the Zan forms. Cf. (Deeters 1930: 14).
CK *da- 'sister': Georg, da- 'sister'; Megr. da(l}-·, Laz da(l)-; Svan udil, widil 'sister (relatively to other sister)'. A kinship term amply attested in Old Georgian: iqo daj misi... 'there was her sister...' Lk. 10.39 (cf. its derivatives: discul- 'nephew', mdad'step-mother'). The / in the Zan plural forms (cf. Megr. dal-ep- 'sisters') is indicated as being secondary by the identity of the vowel in word-final position. Cf. also Megr. da—skua— 'niece'. Svan —// is a diminutive affix. The narrower meaning of the Svan correspondents may be original. 1 1 Rosen (1845: 32).
CK *dab(a)- 'cornfield, village, hamlet': Georg, daba- 'hamlet, village'; Megr. dobera-, dobira- 'arable earth' (?); Svan dab 'cornfield'. Well known in Old Georgian, where it had the meaning 'cornfield, hamlet' (plur. dabn-eb-, derivatives - u-dabn-o 'desert', m-dab-al'low'). The connection with the Megrelian word remains uncertain because of the non-transparent structure of the latter. | | Georgian, Svan: Shanidze (cf. Topuria 1927: 309).
GZ *da-did- 'elder sister': Georg, mdad-, mdade- 'Jungfer'; Laz dad'aunt, step-mother'. Unattested in Old Georgian. It is a compound consisting of *da'sister'and *did- 'big, elder'. Alternatively the term may be considered an adverbial case form of *da- 'sister'. Similar Megr. dade- 'Jungfer' goes back to the Georg, word. Cf. a parallel formation *^ma~did- 'elder brother'. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 29).
36



*datw
CK *datw- 'bear': Georg, datw- 'bear'; Megr. tunt-; Laz (m)tut-; Svan däsdw, desdw, dästw, dastw.
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian sources (Abulage 1973: 110). The Zan forms underwent considerable changes: cf. initial d > t (through assimilation), ancient a > o > u parallel to w (Gudava 1960: 119-120), optional augment m in Megrelian. The data reflect a correspondence Georg. - Zan t ~ Svan st. The archetypes *iaRtvi II tvaRtvi (Bork 1907: 26) and *tut(w)- (Bouda 1950: 296) are untenable. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 29). Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 74). Svan: Gren (1890: 128).
CK *dar- : dr- 'to be unfit, bad': Georg, [dar-] 'to be unfit, bad'; Svan [dr-] 'to be bad'. Possibly Common Kartvelian verb base. It can be reconstructed from derived adjectives revealing two grades of vowel alternation: Georg. m-dar-e (Old Georg, dare-) 'unfit', Svan xo-dr-a 'bad'. Cf. also Georg. u-dar-es- alongside Svan ma-dr-en-e 'worse'. ||Cf. Topuria(1979:71).
CK *dg-am : dg-m- 'to put, stand': Georg, dgam- : dgm- 'to put, stand'; Megr. dgum- : dggm-; Laz dgim-; Svan gem- : gm- 'to put'.
Action noun is Georg, dgma-, Megr. dguma-, Laz o-dgim-u, Svan li-gem. The stem is attested in Old Georgian: ortaperqta dgmasa... 'to stand by two feet...' Mt. 18.8. It contains the base *deg- : dg- and the extension *-am : —m. Contrary to other forms Laz dgim— reflects only the zero ablaut grade. In the Svan equivalent the initial cluster is simplified (for the vocalism cf. *b-am- : b-m-).
GZ *dg-en- : dg-in- 'to put': Georg, dgen- : dgin- 'to put'; Megr. dgin—; Laz dgin-.
Georgian-Zan formation. It is a base *deg- : dg- extended by the causative affix *-en : -in. The stem is well represented in Old Georgian: daadgina igi... '(he) led him up...' Lk. 4.5. Action nouns in the Zan languages are Megr. (e)dgina- and Laz do-dgin-u. 1 1 Deeters (1930: 127).
GZ *dgw(l)ep- : dgw(l)ip- 'to eat (with champing)': Georg, dgvlep- : dgvlip—\ Megr. dgvap-.
The verb stem connected by onomatopoeia with Georg.-Zan *tkw(l)ep- 'to eat roughly, gorge' and *tkw(l)ep- 'to eat (with

champing)'. Its structure remains non-transparent, although the element -ep : -ip seems to be an enlargement. | | Fähnrich (1982: 34).
GZ *dgr— 'to din, rumble': Georg, dgr—ial— 'to din, rumble'; Megr. [dgir-, dgur-].
Georgian-Zan verb stem attested in language of Rustaveli (1122,4). A parallel Georg, gr-ial- 'crash' demonstrates the same derivatory element peculiar to the onomatopoeic formations (cf. *z{r-ial-, *sr~ial-). A Megrelian cognate may be recognized in reduplicative verb stems dgir-dgin-, dgur-dgin- with the same meaning. | | Fähnrich (1982: 34).
CK *deg- :dg- 'to stand': Georg, dek- : dg- 'to stand'; Megr. dg-, Laz dg-; Svan g-.
Common Kartvelian verb stem attested in the shape deg- : dg- in Old Georgian (eri dga.., 'people stood...' Mk. 4,3), where it had a number of derivatives: cf. adgil- 'place', dgroma- 'to stop, stay', etc. In Zan and Svan only the zero ablaut grade is reflected. The Svan root is simplified: the form lag 'he stands' shows apparently a compensatory lengthening of the vowel. In Atina dialect of Laz one comes across the same development. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 294). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 268).
CK *deda- 'mother': Georg, deda- 'mother'; Megr. dida-\ Laz didaOld woman, grandmother'; Svan di- 'mother'. The kinship term. It is an obvious nursery word widely documented in Old Georgian, where it meant also 'woman' (ganewtos...dedaj asulisagan da asuli dedisagan 'they will be divided.. .mother against daughter and daughter against mother' Lk. 12.53). A number of its derivatives is also known here. Cf. *deda-l- 'female'. The vowel i of Zan and Svan words finds its analogy in the Old Georgian bound forms diac- 'woman', diasaxlis- 'hostess of house'. The Svan forms dia-s (dat.) and dia-d (transform.) show an ancient stem-final vowel (cf., however, dedel - child's addressing mother). | | Georgian, Zan: Rosen (1845: 31). Svan: Gren (1890: 128).
CK(?) *deda-l- 'female': Georg, dedal- 'female, hen'; Megr. dadul-; Laz dadul-; Svan dädw, dedw (?).
38



*deda-mtil
Georgian-Zan formation well known also in the Old Georgian sources: mamalad da dedalad sekmna igini '(he) made them male and female' Mt. 19.4. In the Zan form expected ο results in u in neighborhood of / (or under impact of mamul- 'male'). The Svan w regularly reflects ancient word-final /. However the meaning 'hen' is secondary everywhere. Cf. *katam—.
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 105). The rest of cognates is adduced in Marr (1912.2: 425).
GZ *deda—mtil— 'wife's // husband's mother': Georg, deda—mtil— 'husband's mother'; Megr. dia—mtir— 'wife's // husband's mother'; Laz da—nti(r)e—.
Problematic equation of the Georgian-Zan level. It is a compound consisting of *deda- 'mother' and the verbal base *til- 'to replace, substitute'. In Zan words mi > nt. Cf. *mama-mtil- 'wife's // husband's father' of the analogous structure. Svan dimtil 'husband's mother' must be viewed as a Georgian loan, showing the substitution of its first component by Svan di— 'mother' (Proto-Kartvelian final / does not survive in Svan). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 110). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 37-38).
CK *dew- : dw- 'to lie, lay': Georg, dev- : d(v)- 'to lie, lay'; Megr. d(v)-; Laz d(v)-; Svan d-.
Common Kartvelian verb stem. Action noun Georg, deba-, Megr. dvala-, Laz do—dval—u, Svan li—d—i, li—d—esg. In Old Georgian it had an additional meaning 'to have': gaiqida qoveli rajca edva '(he) sold everything he had' Mt. 13.46 (cf. derivative advil- 'light, easy'). Both grades of ablaut alternation are retained only in Georgian. Stem-final w may have left a trace also in Zan forms: cf. Laz tude kododvil 'put it down!'. The Laz word means also 'to put on'. Svan li-d—esg seems to show compensatory lengthening of the stem vowel. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 269-270). Cf. also Schmidt (1962: 104).
GZ *der- : dr- 'to bend, curve': Georg, [der- : dr-\ 'to bend, curve'; Megr. [dir-]; Laz [dir-].
Georgian-Zan verb stem surviving only in bound forms. It may be extracted from *dr-ek- : dr-ik-: dr-k- 'to bend, stoop', characterized by an extension *-ek : -(i)k. Cf. the Georgian (Jav.) derivative verb dr-es

'to twist, roll; to stretch, draw on' attested also in Old Georgian (Abula^e 1973: 142). 1 1 Penrixi-Sar|vela3e (1990: 101).
CK *dwire- 'log, beam; squared beam': Georg, dire- 'log, squared beam'; Megr. dare— 'cross-beam'; Svan dir 'log, beam'. Apparently Common Kartvelian word. In Old Georgian it is attested in the shape of dwire-, dire-: dwiresa ara ixedav... 'pay no attention to the plank...' Mt. 7.3. Cf. Georgian dialectal forms dviro- (Gur.) and diro(Imer.). Megr. (Sam.) dare-, attested in the north-western part of the area, seems to be a native form. The Svan correspondence has compensatory lengthening of the vowel. The Greek origin of the word claimed in Rogava (1975: 348) needs more argumentation.
GZ *did- 'big, large': Georg, did- 'gib, large; elder'; Megr. did-, Laz did-.
Georgian-Zan adjective. Together with its numerous derivatives (dideba- 'grandeur, praise', didad- 'numerous', etc.) it is widely in use in Old Georgian: mas didi erkuas... 'will be called great...' Mt. 5.19. Apparently the word has a sound-symbolic nature. Cf. its probable reduplicated structure and similarity to Lit. didis 'great, big' (see Abaev 1988: 73). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 36). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 234).
CK *didy-in- 'to mumble, mutter': Georg, didyin- 'to mumble'; Megr. dyirdyin-·, Svan ddyan-, dsdyan- 'to grumble'.
Common Kartvelian verb stem of an onomatopoeic nature unattested in Old Georgian. Its final -in II -an seems to be a derivatory element. The Svan action noun is li-ddy-un-e. | | Fähnrich (1982: 34; 1987: 33).
GZ *dika- 'spring wheat': Georg, dika- 'spring wheat'; Laz (m)dika'wheat, corn'. Georgian-Zan agricultural term. It occurs also in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 142). In Megrelian it seems to be lost. Word-initial m in Laz is a secondary augment. As an areal culture word it is attested in some Daghestanian languages: cf. Tab. duk, Rut. diik, Cax dik 'millet'. | | Georgian, Laz: Savaxisvili (1930: 328-330, 406-412).

*dindg-el
GZ *dindg-€l- 'propolis': Georg, dindgel- 'propolis'; Megr. dgvindgv'resin'; Laz dindgu-, dundg(a)- 'propolis'. Georgian-Zan term. The word shows a widely represented correspondence Georg, -el ~ Zan -u in the suffixal position. In the Megrelian form in accordance with a well-known rule the word-final consonant cluster is copied in the word-initial syllable (cf. *ttxel-, *titx-wn-, *3i$g-wn-, etc.). Svan dindgw-ild (cf. Sv. P. 168.34), dingw, dwing, dwindgw 'resin' show that their origin must be due to a Zan source. | | USKJa: 73.
CK *diywam- 'fertile soil': Georg, diyvam- 'black earth, sufficiency'; Svan diywam 'damp low place with fertile soil'. The term is attested in Old Georgian probably as a toponym DiyvamII Diyom- (Kartl. ex. 179.20) a suburb of Tbilisi notable for archeological finds of an ancient agricultural complex. For modern Georgian cf. Raca variant diyvam- and Imer. di(l)yvam-. Connotation 'sufficiency' of the latter form must be secondary. This etymologically non-transparent word resembles PIE *dheghom- 'earth' (cf. Kretschmer 1931: 66-67). ||Klimov(1994:51-53).
GZ *d(l)aqw- 'elbow': Georg. (n)idaqv-, daqv- 'elbow'; Megr. du'-; Laz du(r)qu-.
Georgian-Zan archetype. It is attested in Old Georgian (ukuetu ara idaqvitgan daibannian qelni? 'don't they wash their hands from the elbow?' Mk. 7.3), where the word combined meaning 'arch, vault' (cf. Ex. 38.20). Georg, dlaqv- adduced by S. Orbeliani is supported by the Laz cognate. The first vowel of the latter derives from o (Gudava 1960: 120). For such a change, especially in neighborhood of historical /, see the following entry. In Zan q alternates with0. However, the Laz compound xe-duy— 'elbow', where xe- is 'hand', shows a strange similarity to the analogically formed Kabardian ice(n)-dceYw of the same meaning. In Georg, nidaqv- usually a word-forming element is recognized (cf. Topuria 1979: 70-71). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Deeters (1927: 12). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 50).
CK *dn- 'to melt, thaw': Georg, dn- 'to melt, thaw'; Megr. din-, d&n'to disappear, get lost'; Laz din-, dun-, Svan n- 'to melt, thaw'. Probably Common Kartvelian verb stem. The stem occurs also in Old Georgian sources: dadnis sicxisagan... 'in the heat vanish...' Job 6.17. It

Mola
is tempting to reconstruct a full-grade form of the stem *den-, apparently nowhere attested. The Zan forms (action noun Megr. din-αρά-) underwent a semantic shift. Cf. the Svan action noun Ιϊ-n-e, where the root consonant directly derives from *dn- (the root allomorph (h)in- seems to be due to the metanalysis of the stem). | | Georgian, Megrelian: cf. Topuria (1979: 35). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 271).
GZ *dola- 'hornless': Georg, dola- 'hornless'; Megr. dulu-. The Georgian-Zan adjective unattested in Old Georgian. For Megr. u instead of ο expected in word-final position cf. *rabo-, *yelo-, * yolo-, *c,xro-. The Laz equivalent seems to be lost. It is tempting to compare the lexeme with Indo-European dialectal (Bait.) *dola- 'hornless'. 1 1 Zyenti (1953: 140). Cf. Klimov (1988: 154).
GZ *dr-ek- : dr-ik- : dr-k- 'to bend, curve; stoop': Georg, drek- : drik- 'to bend, curve'; Megr. dirak- : dirk- : dink- 'to bend; stoop'; Laz drak- : (n)drik-.
Georgian-Zan verbal formation. It seems to be derived from the elsewhere unknown base *der- : dr- with an extension *-ek : -(i)k. The stem is attested in Old Georgian, where the zero ablaut grade was also present (da igini midrkes... 'and they bowed low...' Gen. 43.28). Megr. dirakand dirik- are at present distinguished as to intransitivity ~ transitivity. The Laz action noun is o-(n)drik-u. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 270).
GZ *drek-il- 'bent, curved': Georg, drekil- 'bent, curved'; Megr. dirakil- 'curved; perfidious' Laz ndrakel-. Georgian-Zan past participle well attested in Old Georgian, where it usually acquires various preverbs (cf. Abula3e 1973: 142) and underlies a number of compounds. It is derived from Georgian-Zan *dr-ek— : dr-ik- : dr-k- with the participial affix -il. The Laz form recorded in Sarpi is adapted to adjectives ending in -er II -el. | | Cf.Gamqreli3e-Macavariani (1965: 192-193).
CK *dud- 'tip': Georg, dud- 'tip; comb, crest (of bird)'; Megr. dud- 'head'; Laz dud- 'head, top of the head; top; tip'; Svan dud l 'nipple (of breast)'. Common Kartvelian archetype. For Georgian it is attested in Western dialects (yionti 1984: 213). The Svan form contains a diminutive suffix.
42



*dum
The semantics of the cognates presupposes an original meaning 'tip'. For the old term for head see *taw-. On the Zan correspondence see (Cikobava (1938: 44). | | &SKJa: 75.
CK *dum- 'to be(come) silent': Georg, dum- 'to be(come) silent'; Svan dwm-, dwim- 'to keep a secret'. Apparently Common Kartvelian verb stem well attested in Old Georgian: igini dumnes... 'they remained silent...' Mk. 3.4. The Georgian action noun dum-il- points to the sound-symbolic nature of the stem. The Svan action noun is li-dwm-e. | | Fähnrich (1984: 42).
GZ *duy- 'to boil, cook': Georg, duy- 'to boil; make boil'; Megr. duy—; Laz [nduy-].
Georgian-Zan verb stem. It occurs in Old Georgian, where it meant also 'to trouble, agitate; rage' (cf. Abulaje 1973: 143). In the Xevs. dialect it means also 'to cook' (an analogical semantic alternation in the stem *gab- : gb-). In the Zan languages the stem may be extracted from Megr. duya- 'boiling water' and Laz ge-nduy-er- 'a kind of national food' (formally - past participle 'boiled, cooked') In Georgian (action noun duy-il-) the stem by sound-symbolic relations is connected with tux— in tux—tux 'bubbling'. | | Klimov (1985: 169).
CK *dyab- : dyb- 'to soil, dirty; to botch, bungle': Georg, dyab- 'to botch, bungle'; Svan dyb- 'to soil, dirty'. Common Kartvelian verb stem. Its Georgian continuant is extended by a suffix: action noun dyabna-, past participle da-dyabn-il- 'botched'. The cognates reflect different ablaut grades. The Svan equivalent (cf. action noun li-dyb—e) has no extension. 1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 34-35).
CK *dye- 'day': Georg, dye- 'day'; Megr. dya-; Laz dya-, ndya-; Svan la—dey, la—day, la-dey.
Common Kartvelian archetype. Its continuant is widely attested in Old Georgian (daadgra mun or dye... 'he stayed two days...' Jn. 4.40), where it had a number of derivatives. The stem-final a in Zan may be due to the frequent adverbial use of the word, and/or to a plural form of the stem
43



*dyweb-: dywib
dyal- (dyal—ep—i 'days'). The Svan equivalent is marked by an unclear prefixal element la- (possibly reflecting a tendency towards a disyllabic structure) and metathesis of the root vowel. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Rosen (1845: 33). Svan: Gren (1890: 135).
GZ *dyweb- : dywib- 'to churn': Georg, dyveb- : dyvib- 'to churn'; Megr. dyvab- 'to flop, plump (into water), to churn'; Laz ndyvab- 'to churn; go bad'. Georgian-Zan verb stem. In view of its sound-symbolic connection with Georgian-Zan *tkwep- 'to whisk (eggs)' rendering the weakened action, its initial meaning must have been 'to churn'. In Megrelian the secondary semantics predominates (tik dinodyvabu 'he plumped into'). A maximal deviation of meaning is found in the Laz form (action noun o-ndyvab-u, past participle mdyvaber- 'foul, tainted, gone bad'). The stem seems to be related to PIE *dheubh- : dhubh- 'to hit, beat' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 268). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cikobava (1938: 271). Cf. Sardschweladse (1987: 18).
GZ *dyl- 'to be liquid, fluid': Georg, [dyl-] 'to be liquid, fluid'; Megr. (n)dyul-, dyvil- 'to melt'; Laz (n)dyul-,
Georgian-Zan verb stem. Whereas in Georgian the stem can be traced back only through nominal dyl-u 'slush, dirt' (see the pejorative affix -w), in the Zan languages it remains as a verbal one: cf. action noun Megr. dyulapa-, dyvilapa-, Laz o-ndyul-u (initial n must be here a secondary augment). | | Megrelian, Laz:Cikobava (1938: 272). Georgian: USKJa: 76.
GZ *dyl-€z- : dyl-iz- 'to tear, rend (roughly)': Georg, dylez- : dyliz- 'to tear, rend (roughly)'; Megr. dyiraz- // dyiroz— : dyiriz—. Georgian-Zan verbal formation. In Laz it seems unattested. The phonetic correspondences are consistent. A connection with the preceding stem seems plausible (-ez : -iz - is certainly an extension). Megr. dyirazand dyiriz- are distinguished as to intransitivity ~ transitivity. The Megr. form dyiroz- points to former non-functional alternation ell am the stem. 1 1 Gudava (1974: 135). USKJa: 77.
44



CK *e- pronominal element: Georg, e-; Megr. e-\ Laz (h)e-; Svan e-. Common Kartvelian item. At present it usually occurs in bound state (cf. Georg, e-s-, e-g-, dial, e-ma-, etc; Megr. e-na-, e-si; Laz he-α-, he-s; Svan e-$-, e-s-). Cf., however, Laz he {he bigate... 'with that stick...' £Τχ 21.31). In view of its interjectional origin the element is not subject to regular phonetic correspondences.
GZ *-eb verbal thematic suffix: Georg, -eb; Megr. -ap; Laz -αρ. Georgian-Zan item. It is well known also in Old Georgian: odes-igi a$ovebda... 'while he was grazing...' Gen. 36.24. The Zan form shows a regular sound correspondence in vocalism and reveals a change b >p (cf. *ten-eb-a). The suffix marks presentic word-forms. Cf. Rosen (1847: 408) and Deeters (1930: 125).
CK *e-g- pronominal stem: Georg, e-g 'this; it, he, she'; Svan [e-jl·-]. Common Kartvelian demonstrative pronoun well attested in Old Georgian: merme movkueto ege... 'then cut it down...' Lk. 13.9. In the Zan languages it seems to be lost. Their Svan equivalent appears in the dialectal variants e$i (cf. Georgian dial, egi), e$e and e$a, showing regular shift g > 3. The stem must be considered a bound formation (cf. *e— and *—g-). 1 1 Bopp (1847: 71). Cf. Schmidt (1962: 106).
GZ *egr- root element, underlying ethnonym *m-egr-el-: Georg, [egr-]; Megr. [arg-].
Georgian-Zan root extracted from the ethnonym *m-egr—el- 'Megrelian', which must originally have been a designation of inhabitants of the historical region Egr-is-. According to Kaxa3e (1991: 27-29) it is attested in Old Georgian in the shape of Egr- (name of province) and Egur- (hydronym in Western Georgia). Beside regular shift *e > a the Megrelian root underwent a consonant metathesis. 1 1 Brosset (1849: 70). Cf. Beri3e (1920: 23).
GZ *-ed : -id a verbal extension: Georg, -ed : -(i)d\ Megr. -ad : -(i)d\ Laz —id.
Georgian-Zan inheritance. It may be traced historically in several verbal stems, having as its variants —et: -(Of: cf· *sr-et— : sr—it—, *cr—ed— :
45



-et
cri-d- : cr-d-, *qwr-et- : qwr-it-, etc. Originally it might have been a marker of Aktionsart.
CK (?) *-et a toponymic affix: Georg, -et; Megr. -at; Laz -at; Svan
Possibly Common Kartvelian element. It appears mostly in names of villages and regions and is well known also in Old Georgian: cf. Kvirik-et-, Tus-et-, ξο^οχ-et- 'hell'. In Zan it is regularly reflected: cf. Zan—at—, Max- at-·, etc. According to A. Oniani, in Svan it occurs rarely. | | Georgian, Zan: Megrelidze (1938: 31, 68).
GZ *-et a verbal extension: Georg, -et; Megr. -at. Perhaps Georgian-Zan archetype. Although its presence is admissible in such stems like *plet- : pit- it appears usually in verb stems specific for Georgian or the Zan languages: cf. Georg, ckl-et- 'to tear (in scraps)'. | | F hnrich (1987: 33).
GZ *-ek : -(i)k a verbal extension: Georg, -ek : -(i)k; Megr. -ak : -(i)k; Laz —ak : —ik.
Georgian-Zan inheritance which may be extracted from a number of verb stems: cf. *dr—ek— : dr—ik— : dr—k-, *px-ek— : px—ik-, * ywr-ek— : ywr—ik—, etc. Perhaps it reflects a former marker of the weakened (superficial) Aktionsart. Cf. also *-ex : -ix and *-e$ : -i$ in other stems.
GZ *-el affix of noun derivation: Georg, -el - derivatory affix of adjectives; Megr. —a; Laz -a. Productive Georgian-Zan word-forming element. Cf. the adjectives *gr$-el- 'long', *wrc\-el- 'wide', *qm-el- 'dry', and many others. Historically it is present also in nouns of syncretic semantics: cf. *nat—el'light (noun and adjective)'. The correspondence Georg, -el ~ Zan -u is usually peculiar to substantives: cf. *bey-el- 'barn', *c\n-el- 'switch', etc. For the affix see Gamqreli3e-Macavariani (1965: 88-89).
CK *el- 'to sparkle (of lightning)': Georg, el- 'to sparkle (of lightning)'; Megr. να/-; Laz να/-; Svan el-, hel-. Common Kartvelian verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (action noun elva-: vitarca elvaj raj gamobrcqindis . . . 'as the lightning cometh
46



*—en : —in
out of the East...' Mt. 24.27), where it has a series of derivatives. The Zan form (action noun Megr. valua-, Laz o-val-u) eliminates the word-initial vowel by means of v. Cf. also a Laz (Atina) action noun o—al-u adduced in (Marr 1910: 143). The Svan action noun is li-el-e (< *li-hel-el). Cf. Svan (Upper Bal) hel- 'lightning'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Dzanasvili (1902: 27-28). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 272-273). Svan: Klimov (1960: 24) and USKJa: 78-79.
CK *—en : —in derivatory affix of causative verbs: Georg, —en : in', Megr. -in; Laz -in; Svan -in.
Common Kartvelian word-forming element attested in a number of verbs in Old Georgian: ... mjtamca moakudines igi'.. .they could put him to death' Mt. 26.59. Georg, -en appears only in the presentic word-forms of the verb. Cf. action noun Georg, da-dg-en-a 'to establish', Megr. dg-in-apa 'to put, set', Laz o-skur-in-u 'to make dry', Svan li-tr-in-e 'to drag'. ||Deeters(1930:211-214)
GZ *ert- One': Georg, ert-, er- One'; Megr. art-; Laz ar-, art-.
Georgian-Zan numeral which seems to be an innovation replacing Common Kartvelian *sixwa-. It is tempting to derive the word from Georg.-Zan *rt- 'to be a single, whole, intact'. The lexeme is widely attested in Old Georgian (erti senda, erti Mosesa... One for you, one for Moses...' Mt. 17.4), where it has a number of derivatives (cf. Abula3e 1973: 148-150). In Laz word-final t is ordinarily absent. | | Georgian, Zan: Rosen (1845: 11).
GZ *-es : -(i)s a verbal extension: Georg, -es : -is; Megr. -as : -is. Georgian-Zan element which may be extracted from a number of verbal formations: cf. *gl—es- : gl—is-, *mc}q—es— : mc\q—is— and *sr—es— : sr—s-. The extension is present also in a number of verbs retained only in Georgian or Zan languages. Its original function remains obscure.
CK *e-Si- pronominal stem: Georg, ese 'so'; Megr. esi; Laz ese 'so, there'; Svan es 'so'. Common Kartvelian stem represented in adverbs. In Old Georgian it is attested usually in a bound form esre (Abulaje 1973: 151). It consists of a combination of simple bases *e- and *s}-. Cf. also *a-s}- and */-$,-. I I SSKJa: 80.
47



*eks,w
CK *eks,w- 'six': Georg, ekvs- 'six'; Megr. amsv; Laz a(n)s-, Svan usgwa, uskwa.
Common Kartvelian numeral widely attested in Old Georgian: ehts eel stese... 'for six years you are to sow...' Ex. 23.10. The Georgian form underwent a consonant metathesis. The sequence ks of the cluster ksv regularly results in Zan in rs (cf. *gus}- : gSi~). Further substitution r > m (> n) yields the modern Zan forms. The Svan word underwent also a series of transformations. See Gamqreli3e (1959: 29-30). The phonetic shape of the lexeme reflects its non-Kartvelian origin. It undoubtedly derives from continuants of PIE *ueks- 'six'. However, an Armenian source is excluded for chronological reasons. Cf. *otxo- 'four'. | | Rosen (1845: 11).
GZ *e§w- 'wild boar, pig': Georg, esv- 'fang'; Megr. [as£v-] 'pig'. Georgian-Zan archetype. The word is attested in Old Georgian with a meaning 'wild boar' (Abula3e 1973: 152). Its Megrelian cognate may be extracted from the derived formation o-sk-u (< *o-askv-u) 'pigsty'. Their Laz equivalent is possibly lost, although I. Kobalvava (IKE IX-X, 1958: 71) finds it in Laz ckva- 'fang'. A protoform *hesw- is also admissible.
\\ESKJa: SI.
GZ *e£w- 'hatchet': Georg, eco- 'hatchet'; Megr. [ackw-]. Apparently a Georgian-Zan technical term. The word is represented in Old Georgian in the shape of eco-, ecve- and ecva- (Abulaje 1973: 152; Sar;|vela3e 1995: 80): ecuita ... gamotalnes 'with a hatchet ... (they) trimmed them' Sin. mr. 11.29. Megr. ecva- is a Georgian loanword. The phonetic form of the Svan ackw allows one to consider it as an old Zan borrowing. Besides, the word-initial vowel makes one suspect an ancient cultural term of unknown origin.
1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 35).
GZ *-ex : -ix a verbal extension: Georg, -ex : -ix; Megr. -ax : -ix, -ox; Laz-ax.
Georgian-Zan archetype which may be extracted from verb stems *gr—ex- : gr—ix—, *c\n—ex— : c\n—ix—, *cr-ex— : cr—ix—, and some others. The Zan correspondences presuppose a parallel archetype *-ax. The original function of the extension needs clarification.

W
GZ *wal- : wl·- 'to go': Georg, να/- : v/- 'to go'; Megr. t//-, ur-\ Lazul-. Georgian-Zan verb stem widely represented in Old Georgian (mo$iebad vals Herode... 'Herod is going to search...' Mt. 2.13), where it had a number of derivatives. The Georgian forms retain ablaut alternation. The origin of s in the modern Georgian action noun svla- needs explanation (cf. its Megrelian match ula-). The Megrelian root allomorph ur- arises in word-forms of the 3 person combinatorially: *me-ul-s > me-ur-s 'he goes'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 13). Laz: Caraia (1918: 265).
GZ *warcx-wn- 'to comb': Georg, varcxn- 'to comb'; Megr. rcxon-; Laz (n)cxon-.
Georgian-Zan formation known in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 356). In Georgian it occurs also as dialectal (Gur.) barcxn-. (yionti 1984: 60). The Zan continuants (action noun Megr. rcxonua-, Laz o-(n)-cxon-u) lost their initial syllable through an intermediate step *orcxon-: cf. Megr. gircxonu primuli '(he) combed (his) moustache' MT 155.8 and Laz oncxon$iti cxonuman '(one) combs with a comb' CT2 85.12. For the suffix *-wn cf. *krt-wn-, *put-wn-, *jry-H7i-, etc. Svan li-cxen-e 'to comb' despite Lafon (1934: 38) seems rather to continue *prcx-en-.
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Dzanasvili (1902: 22). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 180).
CK *warcjl- 'kneading trough': Georg, varcl- 'kneading trough'; Svan ywarcin 'kneading trough; kind of skimmer'. Apparently Common Kartvelian word, attested also in Old Georgian, where it meant 'rather small vessel' (Abula3e 1973: 159). Cf. also Georg. (Gur.) variant varcxl- (yionti 1984: 221). The Svan equivalent contains an affix of unknown function. Rogava (1978: 123) derived the Georgian word through misunderstanding from Italian vascello 'ship'. 1 1 U. Tsindeliani (cf. Penrixi-Sar|vela3e 1990: 119).
GZ *war3~ : wr3~ 'to sit' (?): Georg, [varj-] 'to sit'; Laz [rj-]. Georgian-Zan verb stem. It ocurs only in a bound form and may be extracted from its derivative *sa~\var^—el— 'sitting'. No certain cognate is

*wasx
found in Megrelian. The meaning of the stem is reconstructed with reservations. | | Cikobava (1938: 161). Cf. Penrixi-Sargvelase (1990: 119).
GZ(?) *wasx- 'to lend, borrow': Georg, vasx- 'to lend, borrow'; Megr. (r)sx-; Laz ex-.
Problematic equation of the Georgian-Zan level. It is widely attested in Old Georgian (mavasxen samnipurni. .. 'lend methree loaves of bread. .. ' Lk. 11.5), where it has a number of derivatives. Just as in the three preceding entries the Zan stem is somewhat simplified. The Laz form underwent a change sx > ex (cf. *msxal-, *sxep-, etc.): o-cx-u 'to lend', ecxer'debt'. Megr. r arises secondarily: ziri maneti...kimersxi 'lend me two roubles' MT 72.8. Sometimes one connects these stems with Middle Persian (cf. Deeters 1930: 76) or Armenian (cf. Acaiyan 1979: 306) sources.
CK *waSl- 'apple': Georg, vasl- 'apple'; Megr. uskur-; Laz uskur~; Svan wisgw : usgw.
Common Kartvelian archetype. The word is attested in Old Georgian (Abulage 1973: 154). The Zan cognate regularly corresponds to the Georgian one (for some deviations in Laz cf. oskur-, oskur-, uskir-). Svan wi in forms of the singular with umlaut indicates *wa > u. Word-final sw (< *sl) according to Gamkrelidze's rule (cf. Gamqrelije 1959: 29) results in sgw; this points to the age of the shift / > w in Svan. The archetype *vaSl-, posited in Vogt (1954: 543), reflects an earlier stage of research. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 71). Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 291). Laz: Marr (1915: 825).
CK *waC|- 'Caucasian goat': Georg, vac- 'billy goat'; Megr. oc-\ Laz oc-, hoc-; Svan ywäs 'Caucasian goat'. Common Kartvelian lexeme well known in Old Georgian: cf. txaj orasi, vaci oci... 'two hundred female goats and twenty male goats...' Gen. 32.14. The Zan forms underwent change *wa > with an obscure emergence of b in word-initial position (in this connection see *wenaqand *we(r)c}xl-). Svan y is regular, while word-final s is due to spirantization of the regular c. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 20). Laz: USKJa: 82. Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 59).

*wed- : wid
GZ *wed- : wid- 'to go, walk': Georg, ved- : vid- 'to go'; Megr. id-, Laz id-.
Georgian-Zan verb stem which is widely attested in Old Georgian: cf. aydeg da vidode! 'get up and walk!' Lk. 5.23.Vowel alternation is found only in Georgian. The Zan forms have lost initial w (cf. Cikobava 1938: 273). In Megrelian an "infixation" of the subject index of the 1 person—b is possible: i-b-d-at 'let us go'. | | Cikobava (ibidem).
GZ *wel- 'valley, field': Georg, vel- 'field, plain'; Megr. ve(l)-. Georgian-Zan word. It occurs quite often in Old Georgian texts: cf. ganved velad... 'go out to the open country...' Gen. 27.3. Although Megrelian / is preserved only in plural forms of the word the Georgian cognate assures its age. The sequence we remains unchanged as in a number of other nouns (cf.*gwel—, *gwerd—, *wer^-, etc.). A connection with Arm. vayr 'field' proposed by Marr is unwarranted. Cf. Deeters (1927: 67-68) and Acaryan (1979: 301).More interesting seems to be a comparison with IE dialectal (Hitt.) wellu- 'meadow, valley' (cf. Giorgadze 1979:65; Gamkrelidze-Ivanov 1995: 793). 1 1 Caraya (1912: 34).
GZ *wenaq— 'vine': Georg, venax— 'vineyard'; Megr. binex- 'vine'; Laz binex—, benex—.
Georgian-Zan agricultural term. The word occurs also in Old Georgian, where it meant 'vine': cf. kacman vinme daasxa venaqi 'a man planted a vine' Mk. 12.1. The Georgian word shows the regular shift q > x. Dialectal (Ing.) menaq- underwent assimilation w > m, due to the nasal n. For e > i before n in Zan see *me(n)-, *nena—, *sen—, etc.; for e instead of expected ο cf. *oc,-, *yor, etc.; initial b remains obscure. The Svan \venaq- 'vineyard' in view of its meaning must be treated as a Georgian loanword. According to Gamkrelidze-Ivanov (1995; 558-559, 778) the lexeme is connected with some Indo-European source (cf.PIE *ueinag—). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 76).Laz:Janashvili (cf.Erckert 1895:292).
GZ *wer - negation particle: Georg, ver; Megr. va(r); Laz va(r). Georgian-Zan particle. It is widely attested in Old Georgian: ver etqoda mat... '(he) could not speak unto them ...' Lk. 1.22; ver yirs var... Ί am not worthy...' Mk. 1.7. Contrary to the Zan languages in modern
51



*werc,xl
Georgian it has a semantics of impossibility of action: cf. ver mirbis '(he) can't run'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103). Cf. Schmidt (1962: 109).
GZ *wercixl- 'silver': Georg, vercxl- 'silver'; Megr. varcy.il-. Georgian-Zan term. In the earliest Georgian sources it is attested in the form vecxl-: daabnia vecxli igi... '(he) threw the money...' Mt. 27.5. In Laz the word is replaced by a Turkish loan. Svan uses borrowings from other Kartvelian languages (a Common Kartvelian designation of silver has been absent since the metal itself is known only from the II millennium B.C.). It is tempting to juxtapose the word with Megr. barcxal-an-s 'it glitters, sparkles'. Attempts to compare the Kartvelian word with NaxDaghestanian forms like Avar Aarac, Lak arcu, Darg. arc 'silver' (Cikobava 1942: 51) or with PIE *ar(e)g- (Lafon 1933: 91-92) don't seem to be attractive. | | Brosset (1849: 74).
GZ *wer3j- 'male, ram': Georg, ver3- 'ram'; Megr. er·$- 'male, ram'. Georgian-Zan word which is widely known in Old Georgian: serciros... ver$i... 'he is to bring... a ram...' Lev. 5.15. As in a number of other cases we remains unchanged in Zan (the loss of the word-initial w needs an explanation). In both Kartvelian languages an original meaning 'male' may be reconstructed: cf. Megr. sxurisi er$i 'male of sheep'. The analogy with the form and history of continuants of PIE *uers- 'male, ram' is obvious (cf. Andronikasvili 1966: 86). ~ 1 1 Caraia (1895X11: 111).
GZ *werxw- 'aspen': Georg, verxv- 'aspen'; Megr. vex-. Possibly Georgian-Zan archetype. The word occurs in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 157). For the retention of the sequence we in the Zan languages see the preceding entries. Megr. vex- is a result of simplification. Megr. verxv- and Svanjerxw-la (<jerxw-ra), xerxw-la seem to be recent loanwords from Georgian. | | Georgian, Svan: Wardrop (1911: 593). Megrelian: USKJa: 84.
CK *wes!- : ws,- 'to fill, be filled': Georg, vs- 'to fill, be filled'; Megr. (p)s—; Laz ps—; Svan gwes— : gws—,
Common Kartvelian verb stem which is amply attested in Old Georgian: ayvivsi me cremlita Ί got filled with tears' Sin. mr. 201.23. The
52



ablaut alternation is retained only by Svan. The Zan cognate (cf. action noun Megr. e-ps-apa) shows a change w >p in a consonant cluster. The Svan word (action noun li-gws-e) has an augment (?) g. If, however, the latter is an archaism (cf. also unclear Megr. gopsa- 'full'), it would be justified to reconstruct *gwes1- : gws^-. The stem has an ancient derivative *(s)a-ws,-e 'full'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 6). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 333). Svan: Deeters. Cf. Schmidt (1962: 110).
GZ *we3i- 'mineral spring': Georg. ve$a- 'mineral spring'; Megr. men^-.
Georgian-Zan term. The Georgian form contains a diminutive affix. Cf. also dialectal (Raca) variant ver^a- (ylonti 1984: 225).Megrelian word-initial w results in m owing to assimilation to the following n (cf. *win 'who'). A connection of the Megrelian word with Georg, maril'salt' is highly unlikely, since the latter originates from a Greek source. More interesting is Georg. (Xevs.) mu$a- 'mineral spring' whose phonetic shape needs explication. 1 1 T. Gudava.
GZ *win 'who': Georg, vin- 'who'; Megr. mi(n)-; Laz min-. Georgian-Zan pronoun which is amply represented in Old Georgian: cf. vin ars dedaj cemi? 'who is my mother?' Gen. 24.47. Word-initial w was reconstructed already in Bopp (1847: 30). In Zan forms w > m because of the following n. The relation of the Svan stem -i- < wi- ?(cf. i-sa haswis li? 'whose daughter is she?') needs argumentation. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Bopp (1846: 286). Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 1 12).
GZ *wic!q- 'to forget': Georg, vicq- 'to forget'; Megr. [cq-]; Laz
Difficult Georgian-Zan verb stem. In unbound form it is represented only in Georgian. For its use in Old Georgian see Abulase (1973: 109, 262, 474).In the Zan languages it can be extracted from its derivative vicq-d- (with a historical passive mark -d). Cf. Megr. cqolad- : cqolid— : cqord— and Laz c(k)ond—, condr-, which are obviously lexicalized. Since the history of the first syllable in the Georgian form and of the middle part of Zan variants is obscure the reconstruction remains tentative. 1 1 Cikobava (1938:416).
53



*wl-a
GZ *wl-a- 'walk': Georg, svla- 'walk1; Megr. ula-, Laz ulva-, lva-. Georgian-Zan action noun. It is a derivative with suffix —a from *wal-: wl-. In Old Georgian the word is represented in the shape ofslva(Abula3e 1973: 399-400), showing metathesis of consonants and secondary s. Antiquity of the latter (cf. Cikobava 1942: 276)is hardly demonstrable.
CK *wlt- 'to divide, separate': Georg, vlt-, vt- 'to divide, separate'; Megr. rt-; Laz //-, rt-; Svan /-. Common Kartvelian verb stem characteristic for Old Georgian: cf. ganevtas mamaj gisagan... 'they will be divided, father against son...' Lk. 12.53(action noun ganvltola-). In the modern language its continuants seem to be absent (according to Acaryan (1977: 355) Georg. nivt— 'thing' goes back to Arm.mwf'— 'element, substance'). The Zan variants underwent simplification (action noun Megr. go-rt-u-ala, Laz oko—rt—u and oko—lt—u, cf. gverdi kako—gi—rt—up 'I'll apportion you a half). The most thoroughly reduced stem is that of Svan. Cf. the action noun U-t-e and na-t-i 'part', which show a compensatory lengthening. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 309).Svan: USKJa: 85.
CK *wlt- 'to run away, escape': Georg. It- 'to run away, escape'; Megr. rt—, nt—\ Laz rt—, mt—\ Svan tw-.
Common Kartvelian verb stem. In Georgian it is known mainly from ancient sources: cf. pirisagan Sarajsa ... vivlti Ί am running awayfrom Sarah' Gen. 16.8(action noun is si-vlt-ol-a-). The Zan forms (action noun Megr. ntina-, rtina-, Laz o-mtin-u) have lost the word-initial consonant and replaced the sequence It by more common clusters. For the Svan correspondence (action noun Ιϊ-tw; cf. itw 'runs away' alongside Georg, ivltis) loss of / and consonant metathesis must be assumed. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 51). Laz: Schuchardt (1902.2: 393). Svan: USKJa: 85.
GZ *wn- 'to injure, harm; to torment, suffer': Georg, vn- 'to injure, harm'; Megr. «-. An uncertain Georgian-Zan comparison. The verb stem is well attested in Old Georgian (cf. mravali mevno me... Ί have suffered a great deal...' Mt. 27.19; action noun vneba-), where some derivatives were also known. The Megrelian stem underwent simplification: on-sn-s 'he injures him' (the identity of the Georgian and Megrelian deverbative nouns in the
54



*-wn
shape of neba- casts some doubts on the native status of the Megrelian verb). In Laz no certain cognate exists. | | Sardschweladse (1985: 23).
GZ *-wn stem-forming enlargement: Georg. -(v) n; Megr. -on; Laz -on, -ol.
Georgian-Zan item. It may be recovered from a number of verb stems: cf. *brdy—wn-, *warcx—wn—., *krt-wn-, *γτγ-wn—, etc. Whereas w in the consonant clusters of Georgian forms is usually lost, in their Zan counterparts it underwent vocalization. In Laz a secondary change n > I may have taken place.
| | SSKJa: 85.
GZ *wrci— 'to be broad, wide': Georg, vrc- 'to widen'; Megr. [pirc—] 'to be broad'; Laz [pirc-]. Georgian-Zan stem of a semantically stative verb. As such it is retained only by Georgian (action noun ganvrcoba-), being attested also in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 161). Cf. the deverbative adjective ^wrc^-el'broad, wide'. In the Zan languages the stem may be found only in the continuants of the adjective. For initial p in Zan cf. *west- : ws^-. | | Georgian, Zan: Klimov (1985: 169).
GZ *wrc!-el- 'broad, wide': Georg, vrcel- 'wide, vast'; Megr. pirca'broad (of eyes), branchy (of trees)'; Laz [pirce-]. Georgian-Zan adjective which is widely attested in Old Georgian (cf. vrcel ars gzaj... 'broad is the road...' Mt. 7.13; cf. also variant vcel-) being in competition with a loanword parto—. For correspondence Georg, v ~ Zan p in the consonant cluster cf. *wes]— : w^-. Ancient sonant r regularly results in Zan in ir. For parallels in the word-final position see *gr^-el-, *crp-el-, *clit-el-, etc. The Laz cognate may be extracted from the compound leke-pirce- 'spot'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: A. Shanidze. Cf. ASKJa: 86.
CK(?) *z- 'to press, squeeze': Georg, [z-] 'to press, squeeze'; Megr. z-, zu- 'to squeeze, knead, rub'; Laz z-; Svan zih- 'to press, squeeze'(?).
55



*za
Apparently Common Kartvelian verb stem. In Georgian it may be found in the continuant of the derived Georgian-Zan stem *z-el-. Megr. zel— 'dough' is its derivative. Laz has an action noun me—z—u. The deviating Svan stem casts some doubts at the level assignment of the archetype. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 274). Svan: USKJa: 86.
CK *za- 'year, season': Georg, [ -] 'season'; Megr. [zo-]; Svan zäj'year'. Common Kartvelian archetype. In Georgian and the Zan languages it may be extracted from compounds, such as *za-mtar- 'winter' and in Georg, za-pxul- 'summer'. These compounds apparently point to an old division of the year into two basic seasons adopted in the ancient Kartvelian calendar. Cf. also Svan zäw 'this year'. 1 1 Marr (1913.1: 316-317; 1936: 222).
GZ *zaku(w)- 'to incite, instigate': Georg, zakv- 'to incite, to act perfidiously'; Megr. zokul- 'to incite, preach'. Georgian-Zan verb stem. Cf. the Old Georgian deverbative noun zak(u)va- 'perfidy, treason; incitement', although zakuleba- is also known. The semantic side of the reconstruction remains tentative. An attempt at an internal analysis of the Georgian stem see in Cincarauli (1987: 52-53). The Megrelian action nouns are zokulua- and metathesized zulokua—. For the correspondence Georg, v ~ Zan / in the stemfinal position see *te(w)-, *pe(w)-, *ca(w)- : c(w)-, *xwe(w)-. 1 1 Klimov (1988: 20).
GZ *za-mtar- 'winter': Georg, zamtar- 'winter'; Megr. zoton$-. Georgian-Zan formation which is well represented in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 162). The word is a compound of *za- 'year, season' and a bound form *mtar- with a conjectural meaning 'cold'. Zan -ton$ regularly corresponds to its Georgian equivalent. The second part of the Georgian-Zan form may be compared with that of Svan li-ntw (Upper Bal.), lu-nt (Lasx.) 'winter', which allows us to reconstruct its less complex earlier form *mt— II *nt—. \ \ Marr (1936: 222).
CK *zar- : zr- 'to take care, keep': Georg, [zr-] 'to take care, keep'; Svan zär- 'to economize (on sth.)'.
56



*zard- : zrd
Common Kartvelian verb stem. Its Georgian continuant may be seen in the derivative zr-un- 'to take care, keep', which in Old Georgian had a great number of meanings (Abulase 1973: 169). Contrary to the Svan
stem (action noun li-zaz-e) the Georgian one reflects a zero ablaut-grade and is provided with an affix -un. 1 1 F hnrich (1984: 42).
CK *zard- : zrd- 'to grow': Georg, zard- : zrd- 'to grow; to bring up'; Megr. rd-; Laz rd-; Svan rd-. Common Kartvelian verb stem. It is attested in Old Georgian, where it had a connotation 'to feed': mamaj tkueni ... zrdis mat 'your Father ... feeds them' Mt. 6.26 (cf. action noun zrda-). The ablaut alternation is retained only in Georgian, where the zero-grade form has the shape zrd- or rd-. The Zan and Svan stems reflect zero-grade form: cf. action nouns Megr. rduala-, Laz o-rd-u, Svan ΐΊ-rd-i (with compensatory lengthening). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Dzanasvili (1902: 29). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 308-309).
GZ *zel- 'to crumple, press, rub': Georg, zel- : zil- 'to press, rub'; Megr. zal-; Laz [zal-].
Georgian-Zan verb stem. It is well known in Old Georgian: action noun (da)zela- (Abulage 1973: 109; Sargvelage 1995: 83). Cf. its Megrelian
counterpart zala-. The stem is derived from *z- (see above) with an
extension —el. The Laz correspondence may be extracted from o—zal-e 'trough for making dough'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103). Laz: PenrixiSar|vela3e (1990: 130).
GZ *zep- 'to thrash, flog': Georg, zep- 'to thrash, flog'; Megr. zap- 'to lash; to scorch'; Laz zap-, zrap- 'to lash'. Georgian-Zan verb stem of onomatopoeic origin, underlined by its expressive p in word-final position. Cf. the Georgian reduplicative
formation zapa—zup— 'flogging'. Georgian variant zvep— reflects a metathesis of v in the deverbative noun form zepva—. For the Zan cognates cf. action noun Megr. zapua- and Laz o-z(r)ap-u. See also *zop-. \\USKJa: 87.
GZ *zer- : zir- 'to look': Georg, mzer- : mzir- 'to look'; Megr. ^ir- 'to
look, see'; Laz $ir-, zir-.
57



*zw
Apparently a Georgian-Zan verb stem. It occurs also in Old Georgian (Abula^e 1973: 238). For the Zan languages cf. action nouns Megr. §ir-apa- and Laz o-$ir-u. The phonetic history of the word remains unclear. Word-initial m may be an organic part of the stem. | | Brosset (1844: 15), Cikobava (1938: 390).
CK *zw— 'to calve, fawn': Georg, zv— 'to calve'; Svan z(w)-. Common Kartvelian verb stem which is well attested in Old Georgian (iremni velta zeda izwebodes... 'the does in the field fawned...' Jer. 14.5), where a number of derivatives are known: cf. ne—zu'heifer', u-zueb- 'barren, dry'. At present it has a dialectal use: cf. Xevs. action noun zveba- (yionti 1984: 232) alongside aoristic wordform i—zv—a, Ing. da—j—z—o 'it calved'. The Svan action noun is li—z—al, li-zw-el-i.

CK *zwer- : zwr- 'to gather, collect': Georg, zver- 'to gather tax, duty'; Megr. zir-, zdr—\ Svan zwer— : zwr— 'to gather (inanimate objects)'. Common Kartvelian verb stem. In Old Georgian it is identified in the noun zuer- 'tax, duty' and its derivative me-zuer-e 'tax collector' (Abula^e 1973: 170, 229). Action nouns are Georg, zverva-, Megr. zirua—, zarua—, Svan li—zwr—i. The Megrelian forms may have been borrowed from Georgian. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Gigineisvili (1972: 151). Svan: Nadareisvili (1975: 114).
GZ *zid- 'to drag, pull': Georg, zid- 'to drag, pull'; Megr. zi(n)d-\ Laz zd— 'to take, arise, drag'. Georgian-Zan verb stem. It is known in Old Georgian: cf. qoveli movizido cemda... Ί will draw all men to myself...' Jn. 12.32. The Megrelian form (action noun zindua-} often has a secondary n. The zero-vocalism of the semantically deviating Zan cognate remains unexplained (cf. Laz ezdu 'he took it', action noun o-zd-u). | | Cikobava (1938: 275-276).
GZ *zizin- 'to crowd (to overflowing)': Georg, zizin- 'to crowd (to overflowing)'; Megr. zizin-. Georgian-Zan verb stem formed in analogy to reduplicated GeorgianZan *s\is\in- 'to eat to satiety', to which it is related by sound-symbolic
58



*zisxl
consonant alternation. Action nouns are Georg. (Gur.) gazizineba—, Megr. gozizinapa-.
1 1 Fähnrich (1985: 26).
CK *zisxl- 'blood': Georg, sisxl- 'blood'; Megr. zisxir-, zisxar-, zisxer-; Laz dicxir-, dincxir-, Svan zisx.
Common Kartvelian archetype. The word is amply attested in Old Georgian: ese ars sisxli cemi... 'it is my blood...' Sin. mr. 175.32. For word-initial z cf. Georg, (dial.) zisxa— 'dysentery'. The Laz form underwent combinatory changes z >d, sx >ex (cf. *msxal-, *sxwerp-, etc.) and has a variant with a secondary n. The stem-final / ordinarily results in Svan in w (cf. dative zisxw) and further in zero. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 58). Svan: Wardrop (1911: 595). Cf. also Marr (1912.1: 426).
GZ *zm- 'to dream': Georg, [zm-] 'to dream'; Megr. zim-; Laz [zm-]. Georgian-Zan verb stem. In unbound form it is preserved in Megrelian (cf. action noun zimapa-), whereas in Georgian and Laz it may be found only in the derivatives *zm-an- and *(s)i-zmar-. The relation of the two stems forms a parallel to *gaw- : gw- vs. *gw-an- and *qaw- : qw- vs. *qw-an.
' | | Fähnrich (1982: 35).
GZ *zm-an : zm-n- 'to dream': Georg, zman- 'to dream'; Laz zmon'to think'. Georgian-Zan formation. It is well attested in Old Georgian: cf. its action noun zmaneba- and past participle zmanebul- (Abulase 1973: 167). Its old noun derivative is also *(s)i—zmar— 'sleep, dream'. The lexically detached Georgian stem zmn— 'to see, foresee, foreknow' (cf. action nouns zmna-, zmnoba-) must have been a counterpart of the first stem form in the frame of original ablaut alternation. In Megrelian its cognate seems to be lost. The Laz equivalent (cf. me-v-o-zmon think') reflects full ablaut grade. | i ÜSKJa: 88.
GZ *zmu- 'to yelp, squeal': Georg, zmu- 'to yelp, squeal'; Megr. zum-in—; Laz zum-in-·.
Georgian-Zan verb stem of onomatopoeic origin (cf. *OZM-, *ymw-, *ck-mu-). In the Zan forms the initial consonant sequence is broken up
59



*zom
into two syllables. The deverbative nouns contain characteristic wordforming affixes: cf. Georg, zmu-il-, Megr. zum-in-. 1 1 USKJa: 8 8 .
CK *zom- 'to measure, be measured': Georg, zom- 'to measure, be measured'; Megr. zim-, zstn-; Laz zum-, zim-; Svan z(e)m-, zam-.
Apparently a Common Kartvelian verb stem. It is attested in Old Georgian, where it had a number of derivatives (Abulage 1973: 168). Contrary to modern zomva- Georg, zoma- 'measure' may reflect an earlier form of the action noun. For Megrelian cf. action noun zim-apa-. In Laz the dialect variation of zim- (Xopa) and zum- (Vice, Arx.) is regular. The history of the Svan variants, especially of their e vocalism (cf. li—z(e)m—e, li-zm-i 'to measure'), which appears to be original, is less clear. Svanzw/nmay have been borrowed from Megrelian. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 303). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 276).
GZ *zop- 'to talk': Georg, zap— 'to boast, brag; to lie'; Laz zop—on— 'to
•· *
talk, converse'. Georgian-Zan verb stem. In Georgian its continuant is attested only in sources of the XI—XII-th centuries: action noun mozopva— and derivative mzopav— 'boaster, trickster' (Sar|vela3e 1995: 117, 132). For Laz cf. the action noun zop-in-. Final p points to expressive nature of the stem. Cf. the parallel archetype zep-. | | Sar$vela3e (1980: Ϊ20-121).
GZ *zrd-il- 'grown up, brought up': Georg, zrdil- 'brought up'; Megr. rail- 'grown up, brought up; Laz rder-, der-. In Old Georgian the word may be traced indirectly: cf. the secondary formation zrdileba- (Abulaje 1973: I69\zrdiloba (Sar|vela3e 1995: 84) 'upbringing'. It is a past participle in -il based on *zard- : zrd-. The Laz equivalent is adapted to the adjectives in -er.
GZ *zrz-en- : zrz-in- 'to perturb, excite': Georg, zrzen- : zrzin- 'to perturb'; Megr. zirzin- 'noise, din, uproar'. Apparently Georgian-Zan formation which is well attested in Old Georgian: rajta azrzenden mas... 'to perturb him...' Bal. 123.35; action noun zrzena—. The Georgian stem reflects two ablaut grades. The descriptive nature of the complex zrz- seems to be evident: cf. *z}rzl- 'to shiver, tremble'. | | SSKJa: 88-89.
60



*zrk
GZ *zrk- 'to be thick, clumsy': Georg, zrk- 'to grow fat, stout'; Megr. [zirg-] 'to be clumsy'. Georgian-Zan verb stem. Contrary to the modern language in Old Georgian it was used also in its original form: ganzrka (maxvili) cmeltagan... '(the sword) ... is covered with fat' Is. 34.6; action noun ganzrkoma-. The irregular correspondence Georg, k ~ Zan g needs explanation (cf. the next entry). In modern Georgian the stem may be extracted also from a deverbative adjective reflecting *zrk—el—.
GZ *zrk-el- 'thick, clumsy': Georg, skel- 'thick'; Megr. zirg-a(l)'clumsy, awkward'. Georgian-Zan formation. In Old Georgian the adjective occurs in the shape zrkel- with a meaning 'fattened, well-fed' (Abulase 1973:169). It is a derivative from *zrk-. For the irregular correlation Georg, k ~ Zan g cf. the Georgian dialectal (Moxev.) form zgel-. Analogical Svan sgel 'thick, dense' derives from Georgian. 1 1 Klimov (1988:20).
CK *zu- 'to weep, sob; cry': Georg, zu- 'to weep, sob'; Megr. zu-l-, zvi-l-\ Svan zu-, za- 'to weep softly'. Apparently Common Kartvelian verb stem. It belongs to a series of descriptive formations, provided with the affix —(/)/. Action noun Georg, zu-il-, Svan li-zü-1-i. Their Megrelian cognate underwent metanalysis (zul-an-s 'he sobs, weeps', noun of action zul-a- II zvil—a-). Cf. also the Georgian reduplicative formation zuzun— with the same meaning. 1 1 Fähnrich (1985: 26; 1987: 33-34).
CK (?) *zura- 'female': Megr. zura- 'coward'; Laz zura- 'female', Svan zuräj.
A problematic Common Kartvelian equation. The doubts are due partly to the phonetical structure CuCa of cognates, characteristic for borrowings (cf. *guda-, *guga-, etc.). The meaning of the Megrelian form seems to be secondary. In Svan is attested also its derivative zuräl 'woman', formed with the affix -al. Similar words occur in some NorthEast Caucasian languages: cf. Chechen $udan 'woman', Lak zura 'bitch'. See Goniasvili (1940:602). 1 1 Kipsidze (1914: 238). Cf. &SKJa: 89.
61



*zywa
CK *zywa- 'sea': Georg, zyva- 'sea'; Megr. zyva-; Laz zyua-, zuya-, (ni)zoya-; Svan zuywa, guywa, $ywa.
Common Kartvelian lexeme widely attested in Old Georgian: stavarda zyuasa... '(it) jumped into the sea...' Jn. 21.7. In Zan and Svan forms a vocalization of w has developed. Cf. also a metathesis and secondary m in Laz. The Svan word shows change z > j. The consonant cluster in the archetype may be deduced from its repetition in all languages. Therefore an archetype *zuyva- (cf. Bouda 1950: 293) seems less plausible. | | Georgian, Zan: Brosset (1844: 15; 1849: 70, 76). Svan: Wardrop (1911:623).
CK *zywan- 'to limit, restrict': Georg, zyvan- 'to limit, restrict'; Laz [ζγοη-] (?); Svan [ywan-].
Apparently Common Kartvelian verb stem. It is known in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 171). In accordance with a well-known morphophonemic rule (verbal η ~ nominal r. cf. *zman- ~ *(s)i-zmar-, *qan *qar—, etc.) it has a nominal counterpart *zywar— 'limit, bound', owing to which the stem may also be reconstructed for earlier stages of Zan and Svan languages.
CK *zywar- 'limit, bound: Georg, zyvar- 'limit, border'; Laz yo$- 'border (of house), court'; Svan (h)aywar, (fy ywra 'limit, bound'. Common Kartvelian archetype based on the verb stem *zywan-. It occurs in Old Georgian (cf. Abulaje 1973: 171), where its derivatives are also found. The word-initial consonant cluster has been simplified
in Zan and Svan words (cf. in this connection *zard-: zrd-). For the augmentation of the first syllable in Svan see *dye-, *kud-, *qba-, etc. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 96). Laz: Klimov (1985: 169-170).
GZ *zyw-ed- : zyw-d- 'to limit, enclose': Georg, zyud- 'to enclose'; Megr. zyvind- : zyod- 'to destroy, exterminate'. A tentative Georgian-Zan comparison. In Old Georgian this verb stem is represented by the action noun mozyudva- (Sar^velage 1995: 132) and past participle zyudvil- 'enclosed' (Abulaje 1973: 171). The Zan forms are represented by Megr. zyvindua- and zyodua- although their meaning makes an alignment with the Georgian stem somewhat difficult.

*zywel
GZ *zywel- 'to pour (of heavy shower)': Georg, zyvel- 'to pour (of heavy shower)'; Megr. [ζγναί-]. Georgian-Zan verb stem. Its Georgian continuant is known from Imer. dialect (cf. yionti 1984:236).In Megrelian the stem can be extracted from the reduplicative formation zyvar—ζγναΐ- of the same meaning, which shows the typical dissimilation / > r in the first syllable. Cf. Georgian-Zan *tkas— 'heavy shower'. 1 1 F hnrich (1982:35).
z,
CK *z,ar- : /if- 'to be lazy': Georg, zar- 'to be lazy'; Svan zar- : zr- 'to bore, pester; be bored'. Common Kartvelian verb stem attested also in Old Georgian: am daizaret...moslvad 'don't be lazy...to come' (cf. Abula3e 1973: 109). Georgian action noun is dazareba-. The Svan continuant preserves ablaut alternation: action nouns li-zar, li-zr-an-i. 1 1 F hnrich (1982: 35).
CK *ζ& 'up(wards), upon': Georg, ze 'up(wards), on'; Megr. zi(n), Laz zi(n)\ Svan zi.
Common Kartvelian adverb. The lexeme with its derivatives is widely used in Old Georgian texts (ze zis igi virsa... '(he is) sitting upon an ass...' Mt. 21.5). As in a number of other cases Georg, e corresponds to Zan i in position before n: cf. *wenaq-, *plen^-, *sen-, etc. Cf. derivatives *zleda, *z,emo-, *zten-. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 62). Svan: Deeters (1930: 16).
GZ *Z!e-da- 'upper': Georg, zeda- 'upper'; Megr. zindo-; Laz zindo-. Georgian-Zan formation representing one of the derivatives of *z\e. This form is known in Old Georgian (notinfrequently in the function of a preverbal element). Its Megrelian match may be also identified in the adverb zidoxse 'from above'. The vocalic shape of the Georgian and Zan cognates is regular. | | USKJa: 90.
GZ *Ζιβζ,- 'to strike, thrash, rumple': Georg, zez- 'to thrash, flog'; Megr. zaz— 'to strike, rumple'.
63



*z1e-mo
Georgian-Zan verb stem attested with a slightly deviating meaning in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 165). Action noun Georg, zezva-, Megr. zazua—. In Laz it is apparently absent. The sound correspondences between the forms are regular. Cf. also vague *zez-. | | Kipsidze (1914: 300). Cf. also Fähnrich (1975: 341).
GZ *Zje-mo- 'upper; top'; Georg, zemo- 'upper'; Megr. zimo- compound preverb 'upwards'. Georgian-Zan formation attested still in Old Georgian as adverb with meaning 'upstairs, upwards' (Abula3e 1973: 165). In Megrelian the form is represented as a compound preverb of the same meaning (cf. the derivative adverb zimolese 'upwards'). Vestigially similar deverbative formations are known also from Old Georgian: cf. zemo-ceril- 'written above'.
GZ *z1e-n(a)- 'upper': Georg, zena- 'upper'; Megr. zino-. Georgian-Zan adjective derived from *z\e. In Old Georgian it is extended by the suffixal -a. A close parallel of the modern Georgian form may be found in the first element of Megrelian compound zino-skuaOffspring of a nobleman'. The difference in meaning from *zledaremains unclear, though. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Dzanasvili (1902: 34). Cf. USKJa: 90.
GZ *Ziwal- : Ziwl- 'to fall; crush down': Georg, zul- 'to fall; crush down'; Laz zul-, zol- 'to be missing, disappear'. Georgian-Zan verb stem, which occurs in Old Georgian: cesni igi daicunen da dazulen 'the heavens shall pass away' III Peter 3.10 (action noun zuleva—, dazuleul— 'fallen to the ground'). In Laz the stem may be extracted from the verb word-form mi-zol-een 'it has been disappeared' (resultative). 1 1 Sardschweladse (1987: 18):
CK *z,wa(w)- 'avalanche, snow-slip': Georg, zvav- 'avalanche, snowslip'; Laz sva- 'landslide' (?); Svan zaj, zäj, zah 'avalanche, snow-slip'. Common Kartvelian archetype characterizing the ecological conditions of the earliest Kartvelian's habitat. In Old Georgian the word is represented in the shape of zuav-. Word-final v in Georgian seems to be secondary: cf. *ta\v-, *xwaw-. Georgian dialects have also a variant zov- (yionti 1984: 234). In the Zan languages no certain cognate is found. Cf., how

CK *ΖίΓ- 'to become damp, wet; freeze': Georg, zr- 'to freeze, congeal'; Svan zr- 'to become damp, wet'. Common Kartvelian verb stem. In the Zan languages it seems to be lost. Cf. Georgian action noun zvra- with a metathesized v and the past participle damzral- 'frozen'. For Svan cf. action noun li-zr-e and the derivative adjective ma-zar 'damp'. | | Macavariani (1965: 28).
GZ *z,rz!- 'to shiver, tremble': Georg, zrz-ol- 'to shiver, tremble'; Megr. zarz—al—.
Georgian-Zan verb stem. It is attested also in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 169). The forms compared differ in word-formation affixes -ol and -al. Possibly they also reflect different ablaut grades. The descriptive character of the stem may be confirmed by its North-Caucasian parallels: cf. Chech, zirz, Lak zirz—ilu 'to shiver, tremble'. 1 1 F hnrich (1982: 35).
GZ *ΖΙΓ—ial— 'to twitter, ring': Georg, zrial— 'to twitter, ring'; Megr. rziol- 'to tinkle, jingle'. Georgian-Zan formation. In Old Georgian this verb stem is not attested. Both forms compared contain a common word-forming element. The Megrelian stem shows a metathesis. For an analogous formation see *sr—ial—.
CK *Z!yap- : Ζιγρ- 'to tumble; plop down': Georg, ζγαρ- 'to tumble; plop down'; Svan zyp- 'to splash'. Apparently Common Kartvelian verb stem. In Old Georgian it is not attested. The glottalized ρ signals its clear expressive character (cf. *siwlep-, *tkep-, *qlap-, etc.). Whereas the Georgian form reflects the full ablaut grade its Svan equivalent continues the zero-grade. 1 1 F hnrich (1982: 35).
65



CK *tagw- 'mouse': Georg, tagv- 'mouse'; Laz mtug-, mtuj-; Svan sdugw, stugw.
Common Kartvelian archetype. Its continuant is widely used in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 172). In Megrelian it was lost (due to taboo?). In Laz the word-initial m must be a secondary development, whereas u instead of expected ο is due to assimilation to the disappeared word-final labial. In the Svan cognate the change a > u is due to the final w (cf. Topuria 1979: 8). | | Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 29). Svan: Bork (1907: 27).
CK *taw- 'head': Georg, tav- 'head, ear (of cereals), beginning'; Megr. [ft-] 'family, court'; Laz ft- 'head'; Svan sda, sta 'ear (of cereals)'. Common Kartvelian word. Together with its numerous derivatives it is attested in Old Georgian (nuca tavsa sensa pucav... 'neither shalt thou swear by thy head...' Mt. 5.35). The Zan equivalent shows the result of a development *aw > u > i. Megrelian preserves a petrified form of the word in its allative case tisa 'to himself, home' (lit. 'into head'). The parallel Svan form lost final w (cf. also *z1waw—, *xwaw-). The Old Kartvelian designation of 'head' may also be extracted here from the adverb sdasw (Upper Bal), sdaswd (Lasx.) 'in private, a deux'. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 43). Svan: Cf. Topuria (1979: 201).
GZ *taw-da 'head over heels': Georg, tawda 'head over heels'; Megr. tudo 'under, below'; Laz tude. Georgian-Zan formation. The adverb consists of the noun *taw'head' and an adverbial element -da. The Georgian form is found in dialectal (Kax.) tavda qira 'head over heels'. The Zan words are widely used. Cf. also "enlarged" Megr. tudole and Laz tudele with the same semantics.
GZ *tal- : tl- 'to plane, shave, hew': Georg, tal- : tl- 'to plane, shave, hew'; Megr. tol-. Georgian-Zan verb stem which is well known in Old Georgian (kacisa xati gamotales... '(they) planed the image of man...' Sin. mr. 38.34; action noun gatla-, past participle gatlil-}. Contrary to the Georgian forms, Megrelian (action noun tolua-) shows only a full ablaut grade: cf.
66



*tapl
dotales didi ocinax. . . '(they) planed a big press. .. ' MT. 1 1 9.34. In Laz the stem seems have disappeared. \\&SKJa: 90-91.
CK *tapl- 'honey': Georg, tapl- 'honey'; Megr. topur-; Laz topu(r)-, topr—, Svan tu, twi.
Common Kartvelian archetype. The word is attested in Old Georgian sources (comda... taplsa velursa 'he did eat... wild honey' Mk. 1.6, derivative tapluc- 'honey drink'). The Zan forms regularly correspond to the Georgian one. The Svan equivalent shows a maximum of changes: here the second syllable is lost, twi derives through umlauted tu from *tup-, which presupposes the development *a > u next to a labial consonant. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 74). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 115-116). Svan: Macavariani (1956: 81-83).
CK(?) *te- 'light': Georg, [te-] 'light'; Megr. [te-]; Laz te-; Svan [te-]. A difficult case. In its unbound shape the word occurs nowadays only in Laz. The prototype is reconstructed on the basis of derived forms such as the verb stem *ten- : tn- 'to dawn, to become visible'.
CK *teb- : tb- 'to raise (of dough)': Georg, [tb-] 'to raise (of dough)'; Svan sdeb— : sdb—.
Verb stem. In Georgian it may be extracted from the derivative noun tb-e- 'dough', attested in Old Georgian texts (Abulaje 1973: 179). While the Georgian stem reflects zero ablaut grade Svan has preserved both ablaut forms (cf. the Svan action noun li-sdeb; i-sdb-i 'dough raises'). | | Suxisvili (1987: 76-80).
GZ *tel- 'sucking-pig': Georg, tel- 'sucking-pig'; Megr. tu- (pl. stem tul-); Laz tila-.
In modern Georgian the use of the word is limited. It seems to have been better known in the language of an earlier period (being also registered in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani). The Georg, -el ~ Zan -u correspondence is quite regular: cf. *dindg-el-, *ttx—el-, *txm—el—, and others. The / element is an insertion in Megrelian forms of the plural. The phonetic history of the Laz correspondence remains unclear. The word seems to be a cultural borrowing from an Indo-European source: cf. PIE
67



tel- : tl
*t l- (< *tHel-t) 'an ovary, the young of a domestic animal'. Cf. *yor' swine'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 244).Laz:Cikobava (1938: 87).
CK tel- : tl- 'to trample, to tighten': Georg, tel- 'to trample, crush'; Megr. tal-\ Svan tel- : tl- 'to tighten, touch'. The verb stem was quite common in Old Georgian (action noun motelva-). In Svan the stem distinguishes two grades of the ablaut alternation e and zero, which serve for making a differentiation between transitive and intransitive verb forms (cf.action nouns li-tle 'to tighten, trample' and li-tel 'to touch'). The vocalism i is also attested here. | | Georgian, Svan: USKJa: 92. Megrelian: F hnrich (1982:35).
CK *ten- : in- 'to become visible; be getting light': Georg, ten- 'be getting light'; Megr. tan- 'be getting light, to spend the night'; Laz tan- 'be getting light, be visible'; Svan ten- : tn- 'to become visible; be born'. The verb stem is well represented in Old Georgian texts (da vitar gantena yame... 'and when the morning was come...' Mt. 27.1). The phonetic correspondence is regular: cf. the Zan action nouns Megr. gotana-, Laz o-tan-u. The Svan facts show the interchange of two grades of ablaut. Svan admits also the internal reconstruction of a simple stem *twen- (cf. a variant of the action noun li-twen-i). The semantic history of the stem has much in common with that of the stem *cen- : en-. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 240). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 277). Svan: USKJa: 92.
GZ *ten-eb-a- 'dawn': Georg, ten-eb-a- 'dawn'; Megr. tan-ap-a-; Laz tan-αρ-α-.
Deverbative formation. The lexeme is known in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 56, 179). The Zan form almost completely corresponds to the Georgian one, its single peculiarity being a devoicing *b >p in the affix *-eb. In Megrelian beside the basic meaning 'dawn' the word has a special technical meaning 'Easter' (hence stems the Svan tanap). Cf. *ten- : tn-.
| | Cikobava (1938: 277).
CK *ter- : tr- 'to drag, pull': Georg, ter- : tr- 'to drag'; Megr. (n)tir-, (n)ter-; Laz tir-,tor-,tur-\ Svan tir- : tr-.
68



*ter- : tr
Verb stem. It is in use in Old Georgian (action noun (mo)freva- 'to drag', satromel- 'sweep net'). In some Georgian dialects (for example, in Xevs.) instead of the expected e we find a, which points to a very early nonfunctional alternation of these vowels. The Megrelian variants (cf. action noun (n)tirua-) reflect only the zero grade. In Laz we can find both: the zero one (cf.tir-) and the e//a (cf. action noun o-tor-u). Consequently, the alternation *tar- : tr- is also of Georgian-Zan age. Megr. n at the beginning of the word must be a later augmentation. For Svan cf. action noun li-tr-in-e. Arm. t 'rev gal 'to trail along, loaf about' seems to be based on the Georg, action noun. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Wardrop (1911: 602). Zan: Cikobava (1938: 281-282), where a different interpretation of the stem vocalism for Laz is proposed.
CK *ter- : tr- 'to drink (wine)': Georg, tver- : tr- 'to get drunk'; Svan tr- 'to drink, to get drunk'. Verb stem well known in Old Georgian (da daitrvnes mis tana 'and they drank with him' Gen. 43.34; cf. the derivatives mtrval- 'drunk', simtrvale- 'drunkenness', etc.). In Georgian the historically affixal (thematic) v is included in the stem as the result of a metathesis: *fer-v> tver-. The e ablaut grade cannot be discerned in Svan (cf.action noun li—tr-e). According to Topuria, the Svan derivative stem in li—twn-e 'to give to drink' (cf. also na-tun 'drunk') goes back to *li-tar-un-e. In the Zan languages the stem has been lost. || Wardrop (1911:602).
GZ *tes- 'to sow, seed': Georg, tes-'to sow, seed'; Megr. fas-; Laz fas-. The verb stem represents a typical isogloss in agricultural terminology, leaving Svan aside. The stem with a number of its derivatives is found in Old Georgian (stesavs teslsa ketilsa 'soweth the good seed' Mt. 13.37; cf. also natesav- 'family, relative', mtesvel- 'sower' and others). Cf. the Megrelian action noun tasua-. In Laz (p-tas-um Ί seed', ge-tas-ul-e 'kitchen-garden') the stem competes with xack- (see *qec-). In the past, through a misunderstanding, the stem was compared with Svan las-'sow' (cf.ZKEVI, 1954:51-53). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 ΧΠ: 103). Laz: Deeters (1930: 125).
GZ *tes-l- 'seed': Georg, tesl- 'seed'; Megr. fas-; Laz fas-. The deverbative origin of the word seems to be evident (see the preceding entry). It is well known from Old Georgian sources (dastesa tesli ketili
69



*tes-w-a
'(he) sowed good seed' Mt. 13.24), where it had an additional meaning of Offspring, heir'. It is worth noting that the equivalent of Georg. / is absent in the Zan forms. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1949: 77). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 145-146).
GZ *tes-w-a 'sowing': Georg, tesva- 'sowing'; Megr. tasua-. Occurs in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 180), where its derivatives are also known. It is an action noun in -a based on the verb stem *tesand containing the Georgian-Zan thematic affix *-aw II -w. Its Laz equivalent seems to be unattested.
CK *tex- : tx- 'to pour, exhaust': Georg, tx- 'to pour, spill'; Svan sdex'to be exhausted'; sdx-, stx- 'to exhaust'. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian texts: dastxion...sisxli igi misi '(they) shall pour...his blood' Lev. 3.13; the action noun (da)txeva- In Svan two historical ablaut grades are distinguished at present as to intransitivity ~ transitivity: cf. action nouns li—sdex and li—sdx—e, li—stx—e. Semantic proximity of the forms compared seems to be rather noticeable. | | Schmidt (1962: 115-116).
CK *twal- 'eye': Georg, tval- 'eye'; Megr. tol-; Laz ίο/-; Svan te, ter.
In Old Georgian the lexeme is recorded in the form tual- (tuali tualisa oil-...'an eye for an eye...' Mt. 5.38). The tol- variant represented in modern Georgian dialects develops as a result of the wa > ο process (cf. *sixwa-, *cixwar- and others). The Svan form goes back to an older *to< twe- (at the end of the nominal stem the original / is regularly lost). The final r in the Svan plural forms causes some difficulties. The Georgian and Megrelian words have acquired a number of new meanings (e.g., 'wheel, gem'). Another Svan equivalent sdul 'loophole' given by Deeters (cf. Schmidt 1962: 113) and F hnrich (cf. Penrixi-Sar|vela3e 1990: 148-149). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 30). Svan: Gren (1890: 127).
GZ *ttx- 'to be thin'. Verb stem extracted only from its derivatives. Cf. Georg.-Zan *ttx-el'thin, sparse' and Georg, si-tx-e 'liquid'.
70



*ttx-el
GZ *ttx-el- 'thin, sparse': Georg, txel- 'thin, sparse'; Megr. txitxu-; Laz titxu—, tutxu—,
In all probability a Georgian-Zan adjective. It is attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abula3e 1973: 185). For the correspondence Georg, -el ~ Zan -u see *beyel-, *dindgel-, *mtkawel-, and others. In the Georgian form the initial homogeneous consonant cluster is simplified. Zan achieves the cluster reduction through the insertion of a vowel. For reconstructing such clusters cf. *cc-, *3i$\wal-. In the Megrelian form there is a typical repetition of χ after the initial consonant as well (cf. *titx-wn-; the fact was noted by T. Gudava). The phonetic shape of the similar Svan datx-el 'thin' shows that it can be a very old borrowing from Georgian. To its non-inherited character may point the word-final /. The change *t > d is due to dissimilation (cf. *tuta-). A connection between the lexeme and *txle is not excluded. || Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 113). Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 22-23).
GZ *tib- 'grass': Georg, tiv-a- 'hay'; Megr. tip- 'hay'; Laz tip- 'grass'. In Old Georgian there was no longer the tib- form, where as a result of a contamination with an action noun tibva- 'to mow' it apparently yielded tiva- with the meaning of 'grass' (ganqma tivaj... 'the grass withered...' Kat ep. 018.24). Cf., however, the tiba- form in the Ajar, dialect of modern Georgian. In the Zan branch the b >p process is well known. The Megrelian form is characterized by a shift of the meaning 'grass' > 'hay'. There exists a corresponding verb stem (see *tib-). In Svan no certain cognate is found. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 112). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 132-133).
GZ *tib- 'to mow': Georg, tib- 'to mow'; Megr. tip-; Laz tip-. A verb stem recorded in Old Georgian (ver moitibos... 'will not be cut down...' Job 8.12). In the Zan form the stem final b has become p (cf. Megr. tipua—, Laz tipala— 'mowing'). The interrelation between Georg. tiva- and tibva was noted in Marr (1912: 40). || Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 112). Laz: cf. Topuria (1979: 9).
GZ *tit- 'finger': Georg, tit- 'finger'; Megr. ki(n)t-\ Laz kit-, tit-. The word is known from Old Georgian texts (dacerilni titita... 'written with a finger...' Ex. 31.18). The Zan forms may reflect dissimilation
71



*titx-wn
of the consonants. Laz has also a non-dissimilated form: cf. titi-mckon'the little finger' (Contes: 81), which makes it possible to reconstruct the archetype proposed above. | | Rosen (1845: 30).
GZ *titx-wn- 'to soil': Georg, titxn- 'to soil'; Megr. txitxon-. A verb stem marked by the stem-forming affix -wn (q.v.). The old sonant w is lost in the Georgian form, but is ordinarily present in Megrelian (action noun txitxonua-), where the development of χ after the wordinitial consonant is natural. The interconnection between the stem and *tiqa- 'soil, clay', suggested by Ja. Testelec (personal communication), seems quite admissible. 1 1 USK/a: 94.
GZ *til- 'to replace': Georg, [til-] 'to replace'; Megr. (n)tir-; Laz [ti(r)-]. The verb stem occurs in its unbound shape in Megrelian: cf. the action noun (n)tirua-. In Georgian and Laz it can be extracted from the continuants of its derivatives *deda-mtil- 'mother-in-law' and *mama-mtil- 'fatherin-law'. The Svan dimtil- 'husband's mother' is borrowed from Georgian. | | flSKJa: 134.
GZ *tiqa- 'soil, clay': Georg, tixa- 'clay, mud'; Megr. dixa-, dexa- 'soil, earth'; Laz (ri)dixa-. In Old Georgian the word occurs in the form tiqa- (da sekmna tiqaj... 'and made clay...' Jn. 9.6; cf. its derivative tiqovan- 'dirty'). The transition q > χ is regular. The *t > d dissimilation is typical of
Zan; in Laz there occurs «-augmentation in the word-initial position. Semantic variations of the lexeme in the languages can be easily explained. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 35). Laz: Tseretheli (1959: 82).
CK *tm- 'to endure; to need': Georg, tm- 'to bear, endure'; Svan tam'to need'. The verb stem is widely attested in Old Georgian texts: action nouns tmena— and tmoba— (see Abula3e 1973: 182). In Svan the stem is found both in a simple form and with —in enlargement: cf. action noun li-tem-in-e and tsmi 'need'.
1 1 Sar|vela3e (1980: 118), F hnrich (1985: 26).
72



*tma
GZ *tma- 'hair': Georg, tma- 'hair'; Megr. toma-, tuma- (plural base tomal-); Laz (n)toma- (plural base - (n)tomal-) 'hair, wool, feathers'. Occurs in Old Georgian (tmaj tawisa tkuenisa... 'a hair of your head...' Lk. 21.18). The presence of the final a in the languages indicates that in the Zan languages the addition of / to the stem is secondary. The historical sonant m is reflected regularly. The Laz equivalent may contain inorganic word-initial n. Contrary to its phonetics the meaning of the Laz word may be archaic. | | Rosen (1845: 30).
CK *to(w)- 'to snow': Georg, tov- 'to snow': Megr. tu-; Laz (m)tu-\ Svan sdu—, stu(w)-.
The verb stem is present in Old Georgian: action noun datoeba- (cf. Abulaje 1973: 110). In Zan and Svan cognates the old o in position before w yields u. In Laz the augmentation of m is possible in word-initial position (action noun Megr. tuala—, Laz o—mt-u', cf. mtups 'it snows'). There exists also a Svan variant of the stem sdw- (cf. action noun li-sdw-e).
| | Georgian, Megrelian: Janashvili (see Erckert 1895: 294). See further Marr (1912.1: 28).
GZ *tow—1— 'snow': Georg, tov/- 'snow'; Megr. fir-, tsr-; Laz (m)tvi(r)—, mtur-.
The lexeme has been derived from the verb stem *low- by means of the affixal element *—/ (cf. *tes—l—, *kwam—l—, *ckint—l-, and others). The word is known also in Old Georgian (...spetak iqo vitarca tovli '...became white as snow' Mk. 9.3). Cf. Georg. (Xevs.) tol-, (Per.) toul-. The reflexes of */ in the languages are regular. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 38). Laz: Marr (1912.1: 28).
GZ *toq- 'hoe': Georg, tox- 'hoe'; Megr. tax-; Laz tax-. A problematic comparison. Since the artefact meant by this word refers to the Bronze or Iron Age, the word goes at best back to the Georgian-Zan stage. In Old Georgian the lexeme is known in the form of toq—; cf. also a derivative toqna- 'to hoe' (Abulage 1973: 182, 264). It is one of the most important terms in the agricultural economy of the Kartvelians which seems to reflect a word of culture (cf. also Arm. f'oxr, t'orx 'hoe, pick-axe'). | | Klimov (1988: 155).
73



*trt
GZ *trt- 'to tremble': Georg, trt- 'to tremble, to shiver'; Megr. tirt-ol'to tremble; to fuss'; Laz tirt-in- 'to tremble'. The verb stem is attested in Old Georgian sources (action noun trtola-). In the Zan languages (cf. action noun Megr. tirtolua- Laz o-tirtin-u) it is extended by different affixes. Georgian and Zan reflexes are in conformity with sonant r. The Megrelian form's meaning is broadened. The stem has a sound-symbolic character: hence the analogies in the shape of the PIE *tres-: ters- and Turk. *titra- 'to tremble'. ||Cikobava(1938:281).
CK *tute- 'moon': Georg, tve- 'moon, month'; Megr. tuta-\ Laz (m)tuta-\ Svan dosd-ul, dost-ul.
The lexeme is widely represented in Old Georgian where it is known in three variants: twite-, ttue-, tue- (cf. xut twite 'five months' Lk. 1.24; daadgra Mariam mistana sam ttue 'Mary stayed with her about three months' Lk. 1.56). In modern Georgian the word has been simplified. The stem's end vowel remains unclear. An m— augmentation is possible in Laz. In Svan the historical diminutive affix -ul has been singled out (see Topuria 1979: 23-24); cf. Svan dosd-is II desd-is 'Monday' - literally 'the moon's (day)'. Other archetype *dute- is proposed in Penrixi-Sarlvelaje (1990: 107). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Rosen (1845: 33). Svan: Gren (1890: 123). Cf. further Bork (1907: 26).
GZ *tutk- 'to scald, scald oneself: Georg, tutk- 'to scald, scald oneself; Megr. tkutk-, Laz tutk-.
Apparently a Georgian-Zan verb stem. In conformity with the known rule in the Megrelian form a secondary k is developed after the initial consonant (cf. *titx—wn—, *ceck—, *$e$g-, *$e$g—, *cecq—). The Megrelian action noun is tkutkua-; Laz (Xopa) o-tutk-u. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Fähnrich (1984: 43). Laz: Klimov (1993: 100).
GZ *tkar- : tkr- 'to break out, burst': Georg, tkr- 'to break out, burst'; Megr. ntkor—, ntkir—.
The verb stem is found in Old Georgian: the action noun tkroma- (Abu1336 1973: 185). The Georgian form reflects only the zero grade, whereas the Megrelian forms (action noun ntkirua-) continue full grade as well. The origin of the parallel Megrelian form ntker- requires explanation. 1 1 Fähnrich (1985: 26).
74



*tkas
GZ *tka$- 'heavy shower': Georg, ikes- 'heavy shower'; Megr. tkos—.
Not found in Old Georgian. The Georgian form may point to the effect of old umlaut. The expected development of sk is not realized because of the presence of k in the stem (cf. *krec- : kric-, *yec-). The stem may have an onomatopoeic origin. F hnrich (1984: 43) sees here the tk- root and tries to relate it with the Svan li-tk-e 'to pour'. Cf. also Georgian-Zan verb stem *zywel- 'to pour (on heavy shower)'.
CK *tkw- 'to speak, say': Georg, tkv- 'to say, speak'; Megr. tk(v)-\ Laz tk(v)—; Svan kw—.
Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian (seesina priad da tkues... 'they feared greatly, saying...' Mt. 27.54). The instability of v in Zan languages (action noun Megr. tkuala-, Laz o-(n)tkval-u} can be seen from contrasting Laz tk-u 'he said' and tkv-es 'they said'. In the Georgian-Zan area there exists also a derivative stem *tkw-am- : tk(w)-m-. In Svan (action noun Ιϊ-kw-isg) the stem is simplified. The vowel lengthening in the prefix U- apparently points to the loss of a consonant. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 13). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 282). Svan: Klimov (1960: 25).
GZ *tkw-am- : tk(w)-m- 'to speak, say': Georg, tkvam- : tkm- 'to speak, say'; Megr. tkum-; Laz [tkum-]. This verb stem is derived from Common Kartvelian *tkw- with an extension *-am : -m. It is well known in Old Georgian where both grades of the ablaut alternation have been registered. The zero grade occurs in the form of tkum—: cf. arasada egre vis utkuams kacsa 'never man spoke so' Jn. 7.46 alongside the action noun tkuma—. Cf. Megrelian action noun tkumua—. | | USKJa: 95.
CK(?) *tkwen 'you (plur.)': Georg, tkven 'you'; Megr. tkva(ri)-\ Laz tkva(n); Svan sgaj(7).
Possibly a Common Kartvelian pronoun. It is represented in Old Georgian in the form tkuen (nu vinme gactunnes tkuen... 'no man deceive you...' Mt. 24.4). In modern Georgian the dialectal variants ken(a) and kten are also known. In the Zan form the final n often disappears. It is more difficult to explain the phonetic history of the Svan pronoun. If this
75



*tkwen
comparison holds the latter derives from *stkwen (> skwen > sgwen > sgäj). Cf. Gamqreli3e (1959: 30-31). 1 1 Georgian, Zan:Rosen (1847: 411). Svan: Marr (1913.2: 10).
CK(?) *tkwen— 'your (plur.)': Georg, tkven- 'your'; Megr. tkvan—; Laz tkvan—; Svan isgwe(j) (?).
The stem of the possessive pronoun does not differ phonetically from the form of the personal one given above. It is amply attested in Old Georgian (cf.bade tkueni... 'your nets...' Lk. 5.4). For the Svan form see the preceding entry.
GZ *tkwep- : tk(w)ip- 'to shake; to beat up': Georg, tkvep- : tkvip- 'to shake; to beat up'; Megr. tkvap—', Laz tkvap—. The verb stem, in accordance with the rules of Kartvelian sound symbolism, denotes a less intensive action than Georg, dyveb- (cf. *dyweb- 'to churn'). The stem is attested in Old Georgian texts: action noun aytkuepa- 'to beat up; to shake, to mix' (see Abula3e 1973:14). The Laz form (action noun o-tkvap-ü) has an additional meaning 'to beat'. 1 1 Klimov (1985: 170).
GZ *tk(w)lep- : tk(w)Iip- 'to guzzle, champ': Georg. tk(v)lep- : tk(v)lip- 'to champ, gulp down'; Megr. rtkap- 'to guzzle'. The sound-symbolic relations specific for Kartvelian languages regularly connect this verb stem with Georgian-Zan *dgw(l)ep- : dgw(l)ip- and *tkw(l)ep- : tkw(l)ip-. In the Megrelian form (action noun rtkapua—) we are faced with re-arrangement in the consonant cluster. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 307). Sometimes a Georgian form is compared with the parallel Megr. tkvap- (Fähnrich (1982: 35).
GZ *txaz- : txz- 'to plait, weave; to compose': Georg, txz- 'to compose, fabricate'; Megr. txoz- 'to follow, chase; pursue'; Laz (n)txoz- 'to plait'. The verb stem is well known in Old Georgian, where alongside an archaic meaning (cf. the action noun txzva- 'to plait', gantxzva- 'to unplait': setxzes gvirgvini ekaltagan 'they had plaited a crown of thorns' Mt. 27.29) a form with a vocalism is represented: vtxaz plaited'. Along with the narrowing of semantics in modern Georgian only a zero ablaut grade is preserved; on the contrary only a full grade is reflected in Zan languages. Cf. the Laz action noun o-(n)txoz-u (ma toma vitxozup 'I'm
76



*txam
plaiting my hair', txozer- 'plaited, a plait'). In the Zan languages forms with an enlargement —in are found: cf. Megr. txoz-in- with the semantic deviation 'to follow, pursue'. The formal and semantic proximity of the archetype of PIE *teks- 'to plait, compose' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 1058-1059) deserves attention. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 285). Georgian: Vogt (1947a: 68). See also Zyenti (1956: 93).
CK *txam- 'top': Georg, txem- 'back of the head'; Svan txum, txwim 'head, top'. The word is known from Old Georgian, where it had an additional meaning 'top, summit' (ganvida adgilsa mas txemisasa... '(he) went forth to the place of skulls...' Jn. 19.17). There are no traces of it in the Zan languages. The interrelation between Georg, e and Svan u allows one to reconstruct primary a (cf. Macavariani 1958: 269). In Svan the change u > wi presupposes an umlaut effect (cf. *gul-, *xut-, etc.). 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (see Erckert 1895: 292). Cf. also Caraya (1912: 42).
GZ *txaml- 'pus': Georg, txaml-, txraml- 'pus'; Megr. txomur-, txumur-; Laz txomu(r)-, txom(b)r-.
In Georgian the word is known only from ancient literary texts (txramli aymosdioda adgild-adgild '(she) had pus oozing out here and there' Krest. 156.37). The Old Georgian variant txaml- comes closer to the Zan forms. The Georg. / and the Zan ur are regular reflexes of the sonant */ (cf. *wasl-, *matl- and others); the vocalism of its Zan reflexes is owed to the proximity of the labial consonant. The Georgian txraml— emerged most likely as a result of contamination of the stem with a verbal base *txar- : txr- 'to dig, dig into'. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 74).
CK *txar- : txr- 'to dig; bury, bury oneself: Georg, txar- : txr- 'to dig'; Megr. (n)txo(r)- 'to dig; bury oneself; Laz (n)txo(r)- ; Svan stxar- : stxr—.
Verb stem widely represented in Old Georgian (motxara ... vecxli igi '(he) dug ... silver' Mt. 25.18; cf. the derivatives mtxrobl- 'pit, hole', txril'pit, hole'). The vowel alternation a ~ 0 is preserved in Georgian and Svan (action nouns are txra- and li-stxr-i, respectively). The Zan cognate is characterized by the a grade (action noun Megr. (n)txorua-, Laz
77



*txewl
o-(n)-txo(r)-u), with the initial n being secondary. The additional meaning of the Laz stem 'to vomit' is based on the main one. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1896 I: 51). Laz: Topuria (1979: 14). Svan: Klimov (1960: 22).
CK *txewl- 'to catch; to look for': Georg, txevl- 'to catch fish (with a net)'; Svan txel- 'to hunt'. Verb stem known in Georgian only from the language of ancient literature (itxevlides raj igini zyuasa mas... 'casting a net into the sea...' Mk. 1.16; mtxevlar- 'a hunter', satxevel- 'net'). As a result of the loss of w in the Svan form (the noun of action li-txel-e) there emerged a compensatory lengthening of the vowel. For the preservation of the final / in the verb stem compare *gal- : gl-, *tel- : tl-, and others. Marr (1913.2: 10) brought together the Georgian stem and Svan metxwjar'hunter'.
1 1 USKJa: 9 8 .
CK *txil- 'hazel-nut': Georg, txil- 'hazel-nut'; Megr. txir-; Laz (ri)txir-, mtxi(r)-\ Svan sdix, stix, stix.
Unattested in Old Georgian. The relation between Georg. / and Zan r at the end of a nominal stem is regular. In the Svan form like in other cases the expected consonant cluster is eliminated by metathesis of the historical root vowel, i.e. *sdxi >sdix. See Marr (1915.1 II: 827). A different viewpoint can be found in Cikobava (1938: 124). In the Svan form the old */ is lost through the intermediate step w. According to Acaryan (1979: 412) Arm. txil 'hazel-nut, acorn' has a Kartvelian source. || Georgian, Svan: Marr (1911: 1201). Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 124-125).
GZ *txip- 'to soil': Georg, txip- 'to soil, stain'; Megr. txip~. A verb stem apparently unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language it is found in the Psav. dialect: its action noun is txipva-. Cf. Megr. action noun txipua—. \ | Fähnrich (1985: 27).
GZ *txl—e- 'sediment (of wine): Georg, txle— 'sediment, sediment of green wine'; Megr. txolo-, txole- 'sediment (of the cooked bekmes [boiled grapes])'.
78



*txl-es- : txl-is
The lexeme forms one of the terminological isoglosses denoting economic achievements of ancient Kartvelians at this epoch. The word is also attested in Old Georgian (Abulage 1973: 186). The identity of the word-final vowel in Georgian and Zan substantives is regular. This lexeme is probably connected with *ttx-el- 'thin' (see Cikobava 1942: 39). Despite Rogava (1975: 346) it can not go back to Greek θολός 'muddy'. In Penrixi-Sar^velage (1990: 156) an archetype *txal— is proposed. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 106). Laz: ESKJa: 98.
GZ *txl-e$- : txl-iS- 'to tear up, cut in': Georg, txles- : txlis- 'to tear up, cut in '; Megr. txiras- : txiris-.
Apparently unattested in Old Georgian. In modern language the dialectal (Gur.) variant txres— : txris— also is known (cf. (\lonti 1984: 256). The verb stem contains a rarely occurring enlargement -es : -is. There is no expected sk in the Megrelian form due to the presence of the velar χ in the stem (cf. action noun tximsua-). 1 1 Gudava (1974: 133-134).
GZ *txmel- 'alder': Georg, txemla-, txmela- 'alder'; Megr. txomu-, txumu—; Laz (ri)txomu-, ntxombu—,
The word is attested in Old Georgian, where it had a more archaic form txmel— (the word-final a of the Modern Georgian form is a secondary affix). It gravitates to West-Georgian dialects and is characterized by the relation Georg, -el and Zan -u. The n and b elements of the Laz forms must be treated as secondary augmentations. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 113). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 129).
GZ *txo(w)- 'to ask': Georg, txov- 'to ask, to marry'; Megr. tx(v)-\ Laz tx(v)-.
The verb stem is well known from Old Georgian where it quite often took the form txo- (cf. the action noun txo(v)a- 'to ask': compare also mtxove me, rajca gnebavs 'ask of me whatsoever thou wilt' Mk. 6.22). In the Zan form v is absent when it is followed by the suffix -u (cf. Laz txu 'he asked' alongside ne-ti gamabi-txv-apur-ja... 'I'll neither marry...'). In Laz the stem seems to be now uncommon (Cikobava (1938: 284). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 114). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 284).
79



*tqa
CK *tqa- 'she-goat': Georg, txa- 'she-goat'; Megr. txa- (pi. txal-); Laz (m)txa-, ntxa-; Svan daq-al.
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian where the process q >χ already made itself felt (da qoveli txaj... 'and all female goats...' Gen. 30.35; there is also a derivative txier- 'wineskin'). The identity of the lexeme vocalism indicates a secondary character of / of the Zan plural form txal-ep-. The m or η augmentation is possible in Laz. The Svan forms daq-ar 'female goats' and la-tq-ir, la-tx-ir 'sheep-fold' point to the historical affixal character of —si and the antiquity of q. The initial group of consonants is here broken up by a vowel lost in the word-final position (cf. *txil-). Slightly different proto-forms are found in Topuria (1979: 18-20) and Cikobava (1938: 81 and 1942: 16). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian and Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 18). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 81).
I
CK *i— deictic stem (denoting remote objects in contrast to *a-): Georg. /-; Megr /-; Laz (A)/-; Svan /"-. As a free stem it occurs rarely in Georgian and Megrelian (cf. Megr. isi [gen.] camali ma gicole 'I'll tell you a remedy for that)'. Usually it occurs in historical compounds: cf. *i-ma-, *i-k-. The initial h of the Laz form is secondary.
GZ *-ia diminutive affix of substantive: Georg. -ia\ Megr. -ia. A word-forming suffix with limited use in present-day Georgian: cf. $amia- Old chap', bacia- 'little hare'. In Megrelian it is much more common: $imaia— Old chap', kiboia— 'crawfish', parpalia— 'butterfly', borbolia- 'spider', etc. However, the diminutive meaning in such forms has been largely obliterated.
GZ(?) *-ik - diminutive affix: Georg, -ik - a diminutive affix; Megr. -ik; Laz -ika.
The word-forming element is attested in Old Georgian texts (cf. vac-ik- 'small goat'). Of both Zan languages it is most widely used in Laz, where it is provided with a final a: cf. xo$-ika- 'a steer, bull-calf. Compare also the Laz diminutive complex affix -ikina (χοξ-ikina- 'bullcalf'). The relation to its Armenian analogue -ik remains obscure.
80



GZ *-il - an affix producing participles: Georg. -//; Megr. -il, -ir; Laz —ir.
Highly productive in Old Georgian (ceril iqo ebraelebr... 'it was written in Hebrew...' Jn. 19.20). Now it is very common for Megrelian: tax-il- 'broken', ul-ir- 'gone'. In Laz, while continuing to be an element of some nominal and verb stems (cf.kibir- 'tooth', mkir- 'flour', skir'son'), it is usually contaminated with one of the adjectival affixes -er. Compare *kb-il-, *pkw-il-, *sixw-il-, *tp-il-. In modern languages the affix forms the passive participle, however historically its semantics was not differentiated by voice.
GZ *-il an affix producing a verbal noun: Georg. -U - an affix of noun of action; Megr. —ir; Laz [—ir]. The affix is widely documented in Old Georgian: tir-il- 'weeping', zax-il- 'crying, weeping', cux-il- 'sadness'. It is rare now in Megrelian: cf. kitx-ir- 'reading, asking'; Ία-ir- 'purchase', skid-ir- 'to befit'. InLaz it may be extracted from the action noun o-lasir-u 'to sharpen, rub'. | | Deeters (1930: 217).
CK *i-ma- a pronominal stem of demonstrative semantics (in contrast to *a-ma- it denotes remote objects): Georg. i-ma-\ Megr. i-mu; Laz (h)i—mu—\ Svan [i—m—].
A combination of the */— and *ma- stems; it is well known in Old Georgian (mivedit dabasa imas... 'go into that village...' Mt. 21.2). In Megrelian it occurs frequently combined with other stems: cf. imu-dyas 'that day'; timu sen 'that night'. In Laz it usually functions independently: himus or mumuli ujonurtu 'he had a cock' C T2 76.5. In Svan it can be found for example in the adverb im-eg 'there'. | | &SKJa: 101-102.
GZ *irei- 'snare (for catching birds)': Georg, irec- 'snare (for catching birds)'; Megr. [iranck-]. Technical term registered for Old Georgian in Abula3e (1973: 189) and in the shape of ilenc- in Sarjve^e (1995: 96). Its Zan equivalent is identified in the Georgian (Upp. Imer.) dialectal Megrelism irancka(yionti 1984: 261). Cf. also the Gur. and Imer. "crossing" form irenckaand Raca rencka— with the same meaning. The word looks like a verbal derivative with the /— prefix. | | Danelia (1984: 77-78).
81



*i-sar
GZ *i-sar- 'arrow': Georg, isar- 'arrow'; Megr. isin$- 'spear, lance; kind of competition'; Laz isi§- 'arrow'. A nominal derivative from the verb stem *sar—: sr— 'to throw' which preserves its verbal prefix /-. The word is represented in Old Georgian: cf. esrodes ... isrita 'they shot arrows' Sin. mr. 273.16. The variations isind—, isand— are widely used in Megrelian, where the shift of the original meaning is obvious. The correlation of the second syllable's vocalism in the languages remains rather vague. There are no grounds for an opinion according to which the word was borrowed from Avestan (cf, however, Bouda 1950: 301). | | Cf. Topuria (1979: 97).
GZ *isl- 'sedge': Georg, isl- 'sedge'; Megr. isir-, (l)issr-\ Laz isir'apera'(?). In the Zan correspondences (cf. Laz boi uyun muco dayis isiri 'its fragrance calls to mind that of apera' [Kipsidze 1911: 22.30]) the i> element is a regular reflex of the old sonant */ which is rendered by Georg. /. The Svan isr with the same meaning must be a loanword from Megrelian (Gamqrelise-Macavariani 1965: 84). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 109). Cf. also Zyenti (1960: 61).
GZ *i-Si- deictc element: Georg, is- 'that, he'; Megr. [is-]; Laz [(fi)is-]. The pronominal stem represents historically a combination of the simple stems */- and *s}-. In its unbound shape it occurs nowadays only in Georgian. In Old Georgian it is known in the shape isi with the function of an article. In the Zan languages it can be identified in such adverbs as Megr. is—o, vis—ο 'there' and Laz (h)is—o 'this way, over there' (initial ν and h are secondary in both cases). Cf. also *a—,s\—. | | USKJa: 102-103.
CK *-(i)Si topoformative element: Georg, -is - topoformative element; Megr. -(Os; Laz -(i)s; Svan -(i)s. Common Kartvelian topoformant. The suffix is known also from Old Georgian toponymy: Tpil-is- 'Tbilisi', Kutat-is- 'Kutaisi' and others. Its regular phonetic equivalents are known in the other languages: cf. Megr. Ca-is-, $ixa-is-, Laz gingila-s-, Svan Qar-is-. In Laz and Svan toponymy the affix is also represented quite widely.
GZ *-iSi-eul- affix producing adjectives of similarity: Georg, -iseul; Megr. -(i)sor.
82



*i-pk-l
This word-forming element is built by adding the *-eul affix to the genitive case form *-«,. The Zan cognate regularly corresponds to the Georgian one: compare Megr. nina—soro 'as a tongue' ~ Georg, eniseulad (in Laz the affix is absent). The attribution to this series of the Svan affix -sal (cf. nin-sal 'as a tongue') is not quite reliable because etymological / was not preserved at the end of Svan stems. | | Cf. Topuria (1979: 10). USKJa: 104.
GZ *i—pk-1— 'wheat': Georg, ipkl— 'wheat'; Megr. irk—. Seems to be an old deverbative formation connected with the verb stem *\pekw-\. pkw- 'to grind' (for the prefix i- cf. *i-sar-). The word is well attested in Old Georgian, where it had also a meaning 'bread, grain' (Abulaje 1973: 189). It does not exist in Laz. The phonetic history of the Megrelian cognate is very complicated. Whereas the loss of p can easily be explained, the further history of the stem presupposes apparently intermediate steps ikl- > ikr- > irk-. The attribution of the Svan itk 'grain' to the reconstructed archetype is by far less reliable. 1 1 Kipsidze (1914: 249).
CK *ipxl- 'fern': Georg, ipxla-, imxla- 'fern'; Laz [limx-] 'a sort offern (Pteridium tauricum)'; Svan ipx. A term apparently absent in old literature although S. Orbeliani recorded the word in the supposedly Old Georgian form ipxl- (a of the modern Georgian form seems to be a recent affix). N. Kutelia sees the Laz correspondence in the form limx-ona- 'brushwood offern', where the beginning of the word is metathesized. In the Svan form final / has regularity been lost. | | Georgian, Laz: Fähnrich (1987: 34). Svan: 03136 (1987: 30-31).
GZ *i-k- 'there, over there': Georg. ik(a) 'there, over there'; Megr. ik\ Laz (h)ik.
The adverb is attested in Old Georgian in the form iki: aka ars Kriste gina iki... 'here is Christ, or there...' Mt. 24.23. Cf. also a Georgian dialectal variant ika. It is a combination of the simple pronominal stems */- and *k-. In the Laz form h may be of later origin. Compare *akawhich is in contrast to it.
GZ *ic,ro- 'tight, narrow, strait': Georg, view- 'tight, narrow, strait'; Megr. [erco—] 'ravine'.
83



*ixwir
A problematic equation. In Old Georgian the word occurred in the form of icro— (sevidodet icrosa mas bcesa... 'Enter ye in at the strait gate...' Mt. 7.13) and.had its derivatives. The Georgian dialectal (Raca) erco- 'ravine' is considered to be a borrowed Megrelian equivalent. What puzzles here is the phonetically irregular vowel correlation at the beginning of the word. Cf., however, Old Georgian si-vicr-e 'narrowing' (Sar|vela3e 1995: 189), where v is a means of overcoming the hiatus in expected si-icr-e. 1 1 Sanije (1965: 734-735).
GZ *ixwir- 'duck': Georg, ixv- 'duck'; Megr. ixving- 'a sort of wild duck'. Found in Old Georgian (in particular in the meaning of 'goose': Abulage 1973: 190). Similar to *kata(m)- 'hen' it is likely to be an old loanword, which is perhaps confirmed by the initial i. Its Megrelian equivalent is preserved as a Georgian dialectal (Imer.) Zanism. Georg. xvirika- 'a sort of wild duck' points to the antiquity of r at the end of the stem. For the word-final r cf. *as{ir- 'hundred'. 1 1 Rogava (1966: 233).
K
•
CK *kaw- : kw- 'to take': Georg, kaw- 'to take, occupy, hold'; Megr. [k-] 'to hold; to pull'; Laz [k-] 'to snatch'; Svan käw- : kw- 'to take, catch'. A problematic juxtaposition. The Zan forms (Megr. kun-, kin- and Laz kn-) may be interpreted as a combination of the historically simple stem with the element n. Cf. Svan action noun li-kw-en-i, past participle la-kaw 'taken, seized'. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 294). Svan: Fähnrich (1984: 43).
GZ *katxa- 'wooden goblet': Georg, katxa- 'wooden goblet'; Megr. kotxo—.
Georgian-Zan archetype. The lexeme occurs in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 19). Its Megrelian variants kortxo—, kortxu— show secondary development. The form kotxo- as a Zanism is known also in West Georgian dialects. The final Megrelian is regular, and may be explained by the
84



*kaka
frequent attributive use of the word: Georg, ori katxa yvino 'two wine goblets' (cf. the same picture in *kope-, *qweza-). Similar Svan katx(a)is an evident loanword from Georgian. The relation of the Kartvelian data to Arm. kddya(y), k9t'xa(y) 'cup, glass'(cf. Acaryan 1973: 584)remains unclear.
GZ *kaka- 'stone, kernel (of fruit)': Georg, kaka- 'grain, kernel (of fruit); Megr. kaka- 'grain, round clasp, piece'; Laz kaka- 'grain, kernel (of fruit)'. A sound-symbolic designation of a solid and, as a rule, round article, as confirmed by the Old Georgian material (Abula3e 1973: 191). Compare also Laz ckonis kaka 'corn'. The relation with the verb stem kak- seems to be plausible. Similar sound complexes are used for denoting round objects in a number of other languages. Cf. Abaev (1958: 505).
GZ *kakab- 'partridge': Georg, kakab- 'partridge'; Megr. kokobe-. The word is registered in the Old Georgian sources: qma-qo kakabman... 'partridge cried...' Physiologus 185:10. The bird represents a popular character of the Megrelian folklore. The stem expecially resembles analogical Indo-European material (cf.Hittite kakkapa, Greek κακκάβη, Arm. kak'av 'partridge'). However, its dependence on a Greek or Armenian source is excluded. Cf. Klimov (1994: 116—118). | | Schmidt (1962: 117).
CK *kal- : kl- 'to lack; to be short of: Georg, kal- : kl- 'to lack; to be short of; Megr. [kul-]; Laz [kul-]; Svan kl- 'to lack'. The verb stem is attested in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 200).A parallel vocalism e is more ordinary for Georgian contrary to the vocalism a, found in the Xevs. dialect. Cf. the Svan action noun li-kl-e. The stem has a Georgian-Zan derivative *m-kl-e- 'missing, deprived'. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 296). Georgian: Macavariani (1958: 270). Svan: F hnrich (1985:27).
CK *kap- : kp- 'to chatter; to rattle with one's teeth': Georg, kap- 'to chatter'; Laz [kap—]?; Svan [kap— : kp—].
In its unbound shape the verb stem occurs only in Georgian: cf. the action noun kap-un-, with a typical affix of a sound-symbolic stem derivation, which may point to an original e vocalism. Cf. Georg.
85



*kap
brag-un- 'crash, din' alongside *breg- 'to strike; make a noise'. There exists an ancient derivative (see *ni-kap- 'chin'). The stem seems to be a part of the Georgian compound Ru-kap- 'Baba-Yaga (witch with huge jaws)' and Svan kap-ra- 'chin'. Compare also Laz (Arx.) kapkap- 'evil spirit' with the irregular vowel reflexes. The connection with a verb stem *kb- remains problematic. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 294).
CK *kap- 'stick; pole, post': Georg, kap- 'stick, bough'; Svan kap 'stake; pole, post'. Unattested in Old Georgian sources. In modern language it is a dialectal word (yionti 1984:271).Cf. its derivative adjective or-kap-ian'bifurcated stick'. Both forms compared match each other regularly. 1 1 Fähnrich (1975: 342).
GZ *kar- : kr- 'to strike, beat': Georg, kar- : kr- 'to strike, beat'; Laz kor- : kir-.
The verb stem is well attested in Old Georgian: cf. the action noun krva- (Abulaje 1973: 202). The stem has not been found in Megrelian. The Laz forms regularly show both grades of the historical ablaut alternation: compare the action noun o-(n)kor-u alongside biga gjokiru 'he beat (him) with a stick' ((? 3. 30.17). | | Janashvili (see Erckert 1895: 292).
CK *kar- : kr- 'to bind': Georg, kar- : kr- 'to bind'; Megr. kir- : ksr-\ Laz kor- : kir-; Svan car- : cr-.
Verb stem, well represented with a number of derivatives in Old Georgian: sekres igi... '(they) had bound him...' Mt. 27.21; compare also sekrul- 'bound', sakrvel- 'ties'. The Zan forms with / reflect the historical zero grade, whereas the forms with preserve its full grade. For the historical ablaut alternation cf. also the Svan action noun li-cr-eni 'to bind' alongside li-car 'knot'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII:106). Laz: Deeters (1930: 125).
CK *kac!— 'man, male, husband': Georg, kac— 'man, male'; Megr. koc'man, male'; Laz koc-, Svan cäs, cas 'husband'. Amply represented in Old Georgian (mohguares mas kaci... 'they brought to him a man...' Mt. 9.32), where it has a much wider meaning
86



*kb
as well as some derivatives. The sound correspondences between cognates are consistent in all languages. In particular, for the Svan reflex of the historical *k, cf. *kar- : kr-, *ked-el-, *kwircx-, and others. In connection with the meaning of the word in Georgian and Zan cf. Georgian-Zan *kmar- 'husband'. | | Georgian, Megrelian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 30), Brosset (1849: 72). Svan: Marr (1912.1: 1094).
GZ *kb- 'to bite': Georg. [kb~] 'to bite'; Megr. [kib-]; Laz [kib-]. The verb stem does not occur in unbound form and can only be extracted from its evident derivative *kb-il- 'tooth'. It may be considered to be the base underlying also Georg.-Zan *kibo- 'lobster'. Cf. *kben- : kb-in-.
GZ *kb-en- : kb-in- 'to bite': Georg, kben- : kbin- 'to bite'; Megr. kibir—; Laz kibin—.
The stem is well attested in Old Georgian (ikbinebian vitarca $αγΙηΐ 'they bite like dogs' Bal. 8.15), where it has a derivative kbenil- 'a bite'. It is formed from a simple stem *kb-. While the Laz correspondence (cf. the action noun o-kibin-u) is regularly similar to the Georgian one, in Megrelian the stem was reshaped after kibir- 'tooth' (action noun kibirua—).
1 1 Cikobava (1938: 291).
GZ *kb-il- 'tooth': Georg, kbil- 'tooth'; Megr. kibir-, kabir-\ Laz kibi(r)-, kibr-, kirb-, cibr-.
Widely known from Old Georgian texts (kbili kbilisa oil... 'a tooth for a tooth...' Mt. 5.38). It is a historical past participle ending in *-// based on the simple verb stem *kb-. The word seems to be a common GeorgianZan innovation in comparison with the Svan sdik, stik 'tooth'. In Georgian dialects one finds the variants kibil- (Ajar.) and kmil- (Tus.). The Zan form kibir- is in full conformity with its Georgian equivalent. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 74). Laz: Deeters (1930: 52).
CK *ked- : kd- 'to build, construct': Georg, [ked-] 'to build, construct'; Megr. kid— 'to partition off'; Laz kid— : kod— 'to build, construct'. In all probability a Common Kartvelian verb stem. In its free form it has been lost in Georgian and Svan. Cf., however, Georg, ked-el- 'wall' (according to S. Orbeliani it means 'building, structure') with the
87



*k(e)d-el
probable Old Georgian nominal correlate of this stem ked- 'corner (with reference to building stones)'. In the Zan languages the stem occurs in its unbound form: cf. the Laz action noun o-kid-u, o-kod-u 'to build, to construct' (the last form must point to a parallel vocalism *a). In Megrelian its meaning is much narrower. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 294).
GZ *k(e)d-el- 'wall': Georg, kedel- 'wall'; Megr. kida(la)-, kzdala-; Laz kida-, koda-.
The connection with the verb *ked- : kd- is obvious. The word also was known in Old Georgian, where it had also the meaning 'fence' (Abulaje 1973: 195). The vocalism of the Laz variant might be secondary, and the loss of the final / is confirmed here by the presence of the form mkidale- 'constructor'. The irregular Svan cwed, cwäd with the same meaning needs more clarification. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 154).
GZ *ket- 'to add; to mix': Georg, ket- 'to make, create'; Megr. kat- 'to add, gather; to produce'; Laz kat- 'to add, gather; to accompany'. The verb stem represented in Old Georgian with the meaning 'to decorate': the action noun ganketeba- (Abula^e 1973: 58). There are also some derivatives: ketil— 'kind, good' uketur— 'evil' and others. The meaning 'to make, create' characterizes the modern Georgian stem. The evolution of the stem's meaning may be inferred from the polysemy of the Zan correspondence (cf. also Megr. ckrials ginikatuans 'it makes squeak'). | | Georgian, Laz: Marr (1911-1914 XI: 398). Megrelian: USKJa: 108.
GZ *kek- 'to stoke, poke (with beak); to knock': Georg, kek- 'to stoke, poke (with beak); to knock'; Megr. kak- 'to pound, grind; to knock'; Laz kank—.
The verb stem apparently served as a base for the derivative *kek-wn(see below). Action noun Georg, kekva-, Megr. kakua-, Laz o-kank-u (cf. ...peperi dokankupan '...pepper (they) shall pound' (?Tl 139.31). The Laz form contains a secondary increment n. 1 1 Megrelian Laz: Cikobava (1938: 288). Georgian: Schmidt (1962: 118).
GZ *kek-wn- 'to peck, to eat little by little': Georg, kenk- 'to eat little by little'; Megr. kikon—, kdkon— 'to peck'; Laz kikon— 'to eat little by little, to peck'.
88



*kel- : k
The stem seems to be derived from the simple base *kek- (see the preceding entry) by adding the word-formation element *—wn. The expected w is lost in the Georgian form as well as in some other cases; one must admit here also a metathesis *kn > nk. In the Zan forms historical w is regularly reflected in o: cf. *warcx-wn—, *krt—wn—.
' || Georgian, Megrelian: Vogt (1947: 75). Laz: &SKJa: 108.
CK *kel- : kl- 'to be lame, to limp': Georg, kel- 'to be lame, to limp'; Svan kl- : kit-.
Attested in Old Georgian: igi kelobda barklita 'he halted upon his thigh' Gen. 32.31; action noun keloba-, cf. mkelobel- 'lame'). In Zan languages no certain correspondence is found. For Svan cf. i—kl—i 'he limps' and ms-kl-i 'lame'. The stem may be the same as *kel- : kl- 'to lack, to be short of. If Arm. kal 'lame' belongs here it retains an expected Zan reflex of the stem kal-. | | Sardschweladse (1985: 23).
CK *kel- : kl- 'to lack; to be short of; Georg, kel- : kl- 'to lack; to be short of; Megr. [kul-]; Laz [kul-]; Svan kl- 'to lack'. The verb stem is well attested in Old Georgian: raj γα makls me...'what lack I yet...' Mt. 19.20; action noun kleba- (cf. Abula3e 1973: 200). Cf. a
parallel vocalism a in the Xevs. dialect. In the Zan languages the stem is reflected in its derivative (see *m-kl-e- 'missing, deprived'). Cf. the Svan action noun li-kl-i 'to lack' anax-o-kl-i 'he lacks'. 1 1 Zan: Cikobava (1938: 296). Georgian: Macavariani: 1958: 270). Svan: F hnrich (1985: 27).
GZ *kenk- 'to peck out': Georg, kenk- 'to peck out, eat little'; Laz kank'to thresh'. In Old Georgian it seems to be unattested. The action nouns are Georg. kenkva-, Laz o-kank-u. According to Penrixi-Sar^velaje (1990: 174), here belongs also Megr. kank- 'to chew'.
GZ *kert- : krt- 'to tremble, to get frightened': Georg, krt- 'to tremble, to get frightened'; Megr. kut- 'to get frightened; to gasp'; Laz (m)kut- 'to get frightened, lose one's head'. Widely represented in the Old Georgian texts (gankrta guli mati 'they were frightened' Gen. 42.28; action noun krtoma—; ganhkertit
89



*kert- : krt
'you shuddered'). The relation between Georg, r and Zan u causes some difficulties. For Zan cf. action noun Megr. kutua—, Laz o—mkut-in—u, where the word-initial m must be a secondary increment. The original meaning of the stem was 'to tremble, shudder'. | | Georgian, Zan:Cikobava (1938:299).
CK *kert- : krt- 'to pluck (out)': Georg, kert- : krt- 'to pluck (out)'; Megr. [kirt-]; Laz [kirt-]; Svan [kart-].
In its free state the verb stem is represented only in Georgian: cf. Xevs. (s)kertva- (it remains unclear whether the Old Georgian se-kertva- 'to stare' belongs here). In other languages it can be traced back either through the verbal derivative *krt-wn- 'to peck' or through the noun derivative (see *ni-krt- 'beek'). Compare also Megr. kirte- 'jaws'. A Georgian form with a mobile s is of interest in view of PIE *(s)kert- 'to strike, to hit'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 568).Laz:USKJa: 116. Svan: Gamqreli^e-Macavariani (1965: 102-103).
GZ *kec- 'clay, clay vessel': Georg, kec- 'clay frying pan'; Megr. kic—, ksc-, Laz kic- 'stone frying pan'. Well attested in Old Georgian where it had the meanings 'clay, clay vessel, tile' (Abula3e 1973:197). The correspondence between Georg, e and Zan i occurs in a number of other cases. The Laz stem is somewhat deviant semantically. Svan kec- 'a clay wine vessel' (cf.Fähnrich 1982: 36) is probably not original. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraya (1912: 10). Laz: iSKJa: 108.
GZ *keci- 'to put together': Georg, kec- 'to put together'; Megr. kic-, k9c- 'to put together, fold; to roll'. The verb stem is recorded in Old Georgian texts (sakecili ertsa adgilsa... 'wrapped together in a place...' Jn. 20.7; action noun gardakeca-, sekeca-; cf. also adverb or-kec-ad 'twice'). The Megrelian action noun is kicua-, kicil- 'folded, wrapped'. In Laz the stem does not occur. We have here one of the examples of the correspondence Georg, e ~ Zan i. Despite Acaryan (1973: 597) the stem cannot derive from Arm. kc'el 'to fasten, join'. | | Caraia (1895 XII: 110).
GZ *kwal- 'track, footprint': Georg, kval- 'track, trace'; Megr. [kul-]; Laz [kul-].
90



*kwam- : kwm
Found in Old Georgian (cf. seudges kualsa missa... '(they) followed him...' Jn. 1.40), where it had numerous derivatives: cf. kualad 'then, again', kualta 'after, following' etc. (Abula3e 1973: 203-204). In Zan its stem may be recovered only in a bound state: cf. Megr. u-kul-i 'after, then', Laz i-kul-e 'after' and postposition -kule, -kule 'after'. || Georgian, Megrelian: Marr (1925: 112). Cf. Cikobava (1942: 22).
CK *kwam- : kwm- 'to smoke': Georg, km- 'to use incense'; Megr. kum— 'to smoke'; Laz mkom—\ Svan kwäm-. In Old Georgian the verb stem is represented as kum- (qoveli igi mtaj kumoda 'all the mountains were smoking' Sin. mr. 267.23; action noun kumeva— 'to incense') and has a number of derivatives, among them sakumevel- 'fragrance, perfume' (Abulase 1973: 205). The noun *kwam-l- 'smoke' is its derivative. The Megr. kuma- 'smoke' must have been historically a deverbative noun ending in *-a\ here is registered also a derivative o-kumap-u 'censer'. Compare also the Svan action noun li-kwam-e alongside kwäme 'it emits smoke'. j | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 295). Svan: &SKJa: 108-109.
CK *kwam—1— 'smoke': Georg, kvaml- 'smoke'; Svan kwäm. The lexeme is well documented in Old Georgian texts (yitarca kuamli gankardebis 'it will vanish like smoke' Bal. 171.17). It must be treated as a historical derivative of *kwam- : kwm- 'to smoke' with the affix *-/ (compare *tes-l-, *tow-l-, *ckep-l-, and others). The lexeme is lost in the Zan languages. At the end of the Svan form the transition / > 0 is regular. Schmidt (1962: 118) does not consider the Svan noun to be native. Proximity of the word to Germ. Qualm 'smoke' must be fortuitous. | | Wardrop (1911: 625). See also Vogt (1947.1: 52).
CK *kwed- : kwd- 'to lose (caused by death)': Georg, kved- : kvd- 'to die'; Svan kwäd 'loss (caused by death)'. The verb stem has a continuant in Old Georgian (cf. razams mokuda Herode... 'when Herod had died...' Mt. 2.19; action noun kudoma-). The meaning of the Georgian form seems to be secondary. The attempt to derive the Georgian form from an archetype *kula—ed— (cf. the scarcely reported Old Georgian action nound mokula- alongside the root kal- : kl
91



*kwet— : kwt
'to kill' and the affix of the passive form -ed) cannot be accepted in view of phonetic difficulties. 1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 36). Gigineisvili (1984: 38-39).
CK *kwet- : kwt- 'to chop, to cut off': Georg, kvet- : kvt- 'to chop, to cut off'; Megr. kvat-; Laz kvat-\ Svan [kwesd-]. Well attested in Old Georgian texts (moikuete igi da ganagde... 'cut it off and cast...' Mt. 5.30; cf. its action noun mokueta-}. In modern Georgian the verb stem has partly been replaced by car— : cr—. The two ablaut grades are preserved in Georgian and Svan forms (cf. the Georgian derivative sa-kut-ar- One's own'). The Zan form reflects the full grade (action noun Megr. kvatua-, Laz o-kvat-u). The Svan cognate can be extracted from the derivative me-kwesd 'short', where sd regularly corresponds to Georgian-Zan t. | | Georgian, Zan: Caraia (1895 XII: 105); Marr (1938: 332). Svan: Klimov (1960: 24). A different Svan equivalent was proposed in Sardschweladse (1987: 19).
GZ *kwet-il- 'chopped off, cut off': Georg, kvetil- 'chopped off, cut off'; Megr. kvatil-. A past participle in -il based on *kvet-. Attested in Old Georgian where it usually acquires various preverbs and underlies a number of compounds: cf. ena-kuetil- 'with a tongue chopped off' (Abula3e 1973: 204, 205). It occurs also with the meaning 'wound' (cf. Sar^velase 1995: 101).
The forms regularly match each other phonetically.
GZ *kwenr 'marten': Georg, kvern—a— 'marten'; Megr. kvinor-, kunor-; Laz kvenu(r)-.
Georg.-Zan term attested in Old Georgian as kuern- (Sarjve^e 1995: 101) which shows the affixal nature of as well as consonantal metathesis. The Georgian dialectal (Lecx.) rkven— seems to have been borrowed in Svan (cf. Svan rkwen, k(w)eri). Kerka3e (1974: 82) endeavors to derive the word from the verb stem kver- : kvr- 'to mark, to brand (cattle)'. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 90).
GZ *kwer— 'flat cake, cookie (round)': Georg, kver— 'flat cake, cookie (round)'; Megr. kvar- 'small round loaf, cookie (maize)'; Laz kvar-, nkvar- 'cookie (round for children)'.
92



*kwer
The lexeme is widely attested in Old Georgian (Abu^e 1973: 205). According to Rogava (1990.2: 80) the presence of word-final r in the Zan cognates instead of expected 3 may be ascribed to the ordinary use of the lexeme in a plural form. There exists also an old reduplicated GeorgianZan derivative (see *kwer-kwer-). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103). Laz: Marr (1910: 58).
CK *kwer- 'crow': Megr. kvaria-, qvaria- 'crow'; Laz qva(r)-o$-, kva—o$-; Svan ewer, cwer—ol.
Continuant forms are not always exact matches phonetically because the Zan variants are influenced by the onomatopoeic complex qva, which has replaced the old word in Georgian (cf. Georg, qvav- 'a crow', a lexeme which was already known in Old Georgian). The Megr. -ia and the Laz -03 (< *-ar) are recent estimation suffixes. Cf. also Svan cer-.The alignment of the word with Greek κόραξ (Rogava 1986: 32) must be rejected. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 108). Svan: USKJa: 209.
CK *kwertx- 'stick': Georg, kvertx- 'staff'; Svan kw rtx, kwertx 'wooden hammer'. Supposed to be a Common Kartvelian word widely attested in Old Georgian with the meaning 'stick' (araraj miiyon gzasa zeda, garna kuertxi xolo '(they) should not take nothing for the journey save a staff only' Mk. 6.8). The verb kurtxeva- 'to bless' is likely to have been derived from it. The Svan correspondence underwent a semantic shift.
GZ *kwer-kwer- 'round object': Georg, kverkver-a- 'round pie'; Megr. kvarkvalia- 'round'; Laz korkol-a- 'curls, sheep's excrement'. Formed by reduplication of the simple base *kwer- (cf. Deeters 1927: 55). Georg, -a in word-final position must be a recent affix. In the Megrelian form the final -ia can be identified as the estimation suffix (see *-ia). The Laz correspondence shows a semantic shift alongside the phonetic change va > o. USKJa: 110.
GZ *kwerciX- 'to break up, split, crush, smash': Georg, kvercx- 'to pile up'; Megr. [kvacx-] 'to break to pieces'; Laz kvancx- 'to smash, crumble'. In Georgian (the action noun da-kvercx-w-a-) the verb stem can be identified in the noun kvercx- 'egg' attested in the most ancient Old
93



*kwes- : kws
Georgian texts (cf. gina tu kuercxsa stxovdes... Or if he shall ask for an egg...' Lk. 11.12). The Georgian-Zan *na-kwercix-al- 'fragment, splinter' is also derivative. In contrast to Megrelian the Laz stem functions independently: cf. its action noun o-kvancx-u. Compare also qona kai dokvancxit\ 'harrow the field properly!' (CTl 6.23-24). j | Cikobava (1938: 159).
CK *kwes- : kws- 'to moan': Georg, kus-, krus- 'to moan'; Megr. kus-', Laz kus—; Svan kwec-.
In Georgian the verb stem contains an affixal element and metathesis: cf. Old Georg, kunes- < *kus-en- (see Vogt 1947.1: 48) alongside the action noun kunesa-. In modern Georgian it belongs to a series of onomatopoeic stems with the characteristic suffix -un (action noun kus—un—, krus—un-). The Zan correspondence reflects the zero ablaut grade (cf. action nouns Megr. kusap-, Laz o-kus-u), whereas Svan (action noun li—kwec) shows full grade. The latter underwent also a substitution s > c. The stem is similar to PIE *kues- : kus- 'to sigh, puff' (Pokorny 1959: 631), due perhaps to its descriptive nature. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 300). Svan: Vogt (1947.1: 48).
GZ *kwes!- : kwsi- 'to strike (fire)': Georg, kves- 'to strike fire'; Megr. kvas-.
Verb stem occurs in Old Georgian, kves— 'steel' as well as the deverbative na-kves- 'spark' are found in the language of Rustaveli. Its Zan equivalent is retained in Megrelian: action noun kvasua-. Our comparison of the Georgian verb with Svan kwes- : kws- 'to cruch, splinter' (cf. fcSKJa: 111) must be rejected. | | Penrixi-Sar3vela3e (1990: 182).
GZ *kwex- 'to push, to fill in': Georg, kvex- 'to push in, to fill in'; Megr. kvax—.
The verb stem seems to be unattested in Old Georgian. The action nouns are Georg, ca—kvex—eba—, Megr. kvaxua-. In Laz the stem does not occur. The transition of the historical sequence we > wa within the verb stem in Zan is regular. | | Fähnrich (1982: 35).
GZ *kwir- 'to astonish, surprise; to be astonished, be surprised': Georg. kvir- 'to astonish; to be surprised'; Megr. kvir-.
94



*kwircx
Verb stem widely represented in Old Georgian: sen nu gikwirnl 'don't be astonished!' Jn. 3.7 (cf. action noun gankwirveba-). For Megrelian cf. action noun kvirapa-. If Svan kwir- (action noun li-kwir-i 'to look') belongs here and is not borrowed (cf. Sardschweladse 1987: 19), then reconstruction can be made at a deeper level. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 256).
GZ *kwircx- 'to be awake, wake up': Georg, [kvircx-] 'to be awake'; Megr. kurcx- 'to be awake, wake up'; Laz kuncx-. For Georgian the verb stem can be seen in the Old Georgian derivative m—kvircx—e 'cheerful, awake' (iqo mkvircxe cinase ymertsa 'cheerful was he near God' Kat. ep. VII. 10). In Zan (action noun Megr. kurcxinapa-, Laz o—kuncx—ü) attention should be paid to u instead of Georg, vi and to the frequent intra—Zan correspondence of Megr. r ~ Laz n. The Svan form jcx- (cf. action noun li-cxin-e 'to wake up') can possibly originate from an earlier *cacx— or *kdcx—.
| | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 300-301).
CK *kwi(r)CiX- 'leg': Georg, [kvircx-] 'leg'; Megr. kucx-; Laz kucxe-; Svan cisx, casx.
In Georgian the lexeme can be extracted from Old Georg. m-kwircx(l)'pedestrian', which has a parallel variant with u vocalism (Abulase 1973: 257). The connection with the first component of Old Georgian kuarcxl-be(r)k- 'pedestal' remains unclear. The stem seems to have been semantically detached from the other designation of a leg *perq-. In the Laz form the final e must be secondary (impact of xe- 'hand'?). The affricate of the Svan cognate is regular : cf. */cac,-, *kar- : kr-, *ked-eland others. The spirantization process ex > sx is also regular. | | Megrelian, Svan: Gren (1890: 142). Laz: Marr (1912.2: 1094-1095). Georgian: Cikobava (1938: 62-63).
CK *kwic- 'mountain she-goat': Georg, kvic- 'colt'; Megr. kvic-; Svan kwic-ra 'mountain she-goat'. If the comparison holds, the word belongs to the Common Kartvelian stage. In the form of kicw- 'colt' the word is attested in Old Georgian (powes kicwi igi dabmuli... '(they) found the colt tied...' Mk. 11.4) and in a dialectal speech. The Megrelian lexeme may be a Georgian borrowing. It is difficult to define the original meaning of the word. | | Fähnrich (1980: 73).

*ki
CK *ki- 'to cry': Georg, ki-v- 'to cry'; Megr. rki-; Laz kij-, ki(r)-, k(r)-, k(r)i-; Svan hi-.
One of the onomatopoeic stems in -i (cf. *qi-, *cxi-, *ci-). In Georgian the stem occurs in the language of Rustaveli (cf. 1038.1, 1588.2). The consonant v historically did not belong to the stem, r of the Zan correspondences must be interpreted in the same way: cf. Megr. rkiap- 'to cry', rkia- 'a cry', Laz o-kirap-u, o-kij(ap)-u 'to cry' (see Cikobava 1938: 298). For Svan cf. the action noun li-kll-i). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938:297-298). Svan: Tseretheli (1959: 80).
GZ *kibo- 'lobster': Georg, kibo- 'lobster'; Megr. kibo-, kiboia-. Apparently a Georgian-Zan lexeme. A connection with the verb stem *kb— is possible. In Megrelian the form with an estimation suffix *—ia seems to be more common. In Laz it is not recorded. The word does not occur in Svan: no lobsters are found in Svanetia. | | Brosset (1849: 74).
CK *kid- 'to take; to hang': Georg, kid- 'to take; to hang'; Megr. kid-, kind- 'to take with a hand'; Laz kid- 'to snatch; to hang'; Svan kid-: kd'totake'. Verb stem well known from the earliest Old Georgian manuscripts: ayikidos ^uari misi... 'to hang his cross...' Mt. 27.32 (the action noun a(Y)kideba-). In Zan and Georgian the stem is found with identical vocalism (action noun Megr. kidapa-, Laz o-kid-u). In Svan other ablaut grades of the stem occur: ked-, kad-, kd- (action noun li-ked). Sometimes the connection of the stem *kid- with Georg, cidil-, cidaoba'wrestling' is assumed (Tseretheli 1959: 85). A connection with Georgian-Zan *ked- 'to build' seems improbable. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 292).
GZ *kit- 'finger, toe': Georg, tit- 'finger, toe'; Megr. kint-, kit-; Laz kit-, [tit-].
The word is known from Old Georgian texts (dacerilni titita... 'written with a finger...' Ex. 31.18). The Georgian form may reflect assimilation of the first consonant: cf. Georg, kit- 'kind of grape' (according to Penrixi-Sar^velaje 1990: 184 - "finger-like"). If the Laz titi-mckon'little finger' (cf. Contes: 81: 3) is not a misprint it allows us to reconstruct the archetype *tit—. | | Rosen (1845: 30).

*kitx
GZ *kitx- 'to ask': Georg, kitx- 'to ask, read'; Megr. kitx-; Laz ki(n)tx-, citx- 'to ask, scold, read'. Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian : hkitxa ertman matganman,.. One of them asked him ...' Mt. 22.35 (action noun kitxva-). The main Zan variant is identical with the Georgian one (action noun Megr. kitxir-, Laz o-kitx—u). In Laz insertion of n may take place, besides in its Artashen dialect the stem undergoes a change k > c. It is evident that the meaning 'to read' must be secondary. The connotation 'to scold' is specific of Laz. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 292-293).
GZ *ldk-wn- 'to eat little by little, peck': Georg, kikn- 'to eat little by little, pluck'; Megr. kikon-, kskon- 'to peck'; Laz kikon-. Unattested in Old Georgian. The stem is derived from the simple base *kek- by adding the word-forming element *-wn. The expected w is regularly lost in Georgian as in other cases of such formation whereas in its Zan cognates it is reflected as o: cf. *warcx-wn-, *krt-wn-, *ls-wnetc. For the shift e > i in analogous cases cf. *yec- alongside *yic-wn-, *ceck- alongside *cick-wn-, and many others. | | Megrelian, Laz: USKJa: 108. Georgian: Fähnrich (1980: 180).
CK(?) *klde- 'rock': Georg, klde- 'rock'; Megr. kirde-, kzrde-; Svan
*<>$-(?).'
Well known in Old Georgian written sources: sxuaj davarda kldesa zeda 'some fell upon stony places' Mt. 13.5 (cf. its derivative kldovan'rocky'). There are also the forms kilde-, kte-, kde- in Georgian dialects (yionti 1984: 278, 291, 311). In Laz the word seems to have been lost. The identity of the stem-final vowel in the substantive is regular (there are, however, also such Megrelian forms as kirda-, ksrda-). The connection with the Svan word remains in dispute. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 109). Svan: Macavariani (1965: 62).
GZ *kod- 'to hew, hollow': Georg, kod- 'to hollow, to castrate'; Megr. [kod-i; Laz [kod-] 'to hollow'.
The verb stem exists only in Georgian if used on its own. It is also attested in Old Georgian: da dakoda sesaj 'and he hewed firewood' Gen. 22.3 (action noun koda-). In some nominal formations the stem is also preserved in the Zan languages. See the following entry and *kodal-.

*kod
GZ *kod- 'vessel made of one piece of wood, tub': Georg, kod- 'vessel (and measure) for dry substances, tub'; Megr. kod- 'vessel made of one piece of wood'; Laz kod-. In Georgian the word is known also from medieval literature. It seems to be connected with the verb stem *kod- 'to hew, hollow'. The phonological correspondences are regular. Svan (L. Bal) kwed with the same meaning does not seem to be native. Arm. hot 'measure for dry substances' is an evident Kartvelian loanword. \\USKJa: 113.
GZ *kodal- 'woodpecker': Georg, kodal- 'woodpecker'; Megr. kidu-, kada; Laz kid—; (m)kud-.
The lexeme is derived from the verb stem *kod-. It is registered in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani, who interprets the word like xe-koda- 'hollowing the tree' (cf. Cikobava 1938: 107). Cf. also West Georgian kodara(yionti 1984: 297), which shows another word-forming suffix. It is not quite clear whether the Georgian derivatory suffix -al corresponds to the Zan one in Megrelian forms.
1 1 Cikobava (1938: 106-107).
GZ *kowz- 'spoon': Georg, kowz- 'spoon'; Megr. kdz-, kiz-; Laz kuz, kiz'wooden spoon'. A Georgian-Zan isogloss in technical terminology. The word is attested in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 201). Forms kobz-, komz-, koz- are attested in Georgian dialects (yionti 1984: 298). Megr. kovz- must be viewed as a recent Georgian loanword. According to Schmidt (1962: 120) the Georgian lexeme underwent metathesis zv > vz which leads to the protoform *kozw-. For the correspondence in vocalism cf. *kodal- and
*krko-.
' |'| Cikobava (1938: 176).
GZ *kon- 'to tie together': Georg, kon- 'to tie together'; Svan cwen-. In Old Georgian the verb stem may be identified in the noun kona'bundle' (Abulaje 1973: 201). In the Zan languages no certain cognate is found. For Svan cf. action noun li-cwen-i 'to tie together', li-con-e 'to be
wrapped'. The form belongs to a number of stems where ancient *k is rendered in Svan by the affricate c (see also *kac\—, *kedel-, *kwarclxl-, *mkerd—).
| | Georgian, Svan: Marr (1912.2: 1094).
98



*konc,x
GZ *konCiX- 'top': Georg, koncx- 'cape, top'; Megr. [koncx-}. In Old Georgian the word is attested with the meaning 'top, a heap of stones' (Abulase 1973: 201; Sar^velase 1995: 100). Its Megrelian correspondence is preserved as a toponym Koncx- denoting a mountain in West Georgia. The Svan (Upper Bal) kacx 'top (of the tree)' does not belong here. | | Georgian, Zan: Fähnrich (1984: 43).
GZ *kope- 'scoop (for wine)': Georg, hope- 'scoop (for wine)'; Megr. kopa-\ Laz kopa 'big spoon'. In Old Georgian texts the word does not seem to occur. In the Zan form the change *e > a must have a sandhi origin. Megr. kopesia— 'gourd used for making dishes' seems to be based on the Georgian word. The semantic shift in Laz is determined by the dominance of Islam among the native speakers. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103). Laz: Marr (1925.2: 85-86).
GZ *koyo- 'gnat': Georg, koyo- 'gnat'; Megr. koyo-. Might be of a sound-symbolic nature as indicated by its vocalism. The Zan forms koyona-, ko(r)yun-, as well as the Svan forms koyon, kuyun and kayan are Georgian loanwords based on Georg, koyona- (< koyo-un—a—). There exists also an evidently secondary parallel formation koyunia- with an estimation suffix -ia in Megrelian. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 113-114), where the stem is considered to be koy-.
CK *kr- 'to shine': Georg, kr- 'to shine'; Svan kr-, A verb stem unattested in Old Georgian texts. However, in the modern language its derivatives are found: kr-ial- 'lustre' and sa-rk-e- 'mirror' (with metathesis kr > rk). Svan kr— (action noun li—kr—e 'to shine', na-kr-i 'lustre') is identical with the Georgian stem. | j Tseretheli (1959: 90).
GZ *kraw- 'lamb': Georg, krav- 'lamb'; Megr. kirib-, The lexeme is well attested in Old Georgian written sources (daa^oven kravni cemni... 'feed my lambs...' Jn. 21.15). Here we are faced with a rare correspondence Georg, a ~ Zan i in the stem (the first-syllable vocalism of the Megrelian stem regularly corresponds to the sound zero

*kreb- : krb
of the Georgian one). For the unusual correspondence Georg, v ~ Zan b cf. *tqaw-, *qew-, Deeters (1926-1927: 6) considered the Megrelian lexeme a Georgian loanword. 1 1 Caraia (1895 XII: 102).
GZ *kreb- : krb- 'to gather, to get together': Georg, kreb- : krb- 'to gather'; Megr. korob-; Laz ko(r)ob-. Verb stem well known in Old Georgian texts (with several grades of vowel alternation kreb- : krib- : krb- II kerb-), where there is a number of its derivatives (da damokrba krebuli 'and (all) the council gathered' Jg. 20.1). The Zan pleophony (action noun Megr. korobua-, Laz o-ko(r)ob-u) is secondary. Since Zan ο presupposes ancient *a the reconstruction of the e vocalism as well as in a number of other cases remains somewhat doubtful. Vogt (1947.1: 39-40) accepts the connection of the stem with *kar- : kr— 'to connect' and reconstructs the prototype *kar-eb-). The parallel variant of the stem *krep- : krip- is also old. ' | | Marr (1914: 74-75).
GZ *krep- : krip- 'to gather, pick (fruit, flowers)': Georg, krep- : krip'to gather, pick (fruit, flowers)'; Megr. korop-. The verb stem forms a parallel to *kreb- : krib-. The reconstruction of e for its full grade vocalism (instead of a suggested by the Megr. action noun koropua-) remains conjectural. There is a special semantics in the stem in comparison with the preceding one. Its similarity to PIE *(s)krep- : (s)kerp- 'to pick, to cut' is worth mentioning.
GZ *kreC- : kriC- : krC- 'to cut, cut off': Georg, krec- : kric- 'to cut, to
· · * · · · 7 ^.... 7
clip'; Megr. kirac- : kirc- 'to cut'; Laz kric-. The available material (action noun Georg, kreca-, Megr. kiracua-, Laz o-kric-u) reflects three ablaut grades. The complex ck expected in the Zan continuants does not develop because of the back k contained in the archetype. The syllable *-ec : -ic might be a historical extension. Svan li-klic-e with the same meaning can hardly be inherited. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Gudava (1974: 133-134). Laz: Sardschweladse (1987: 19).
GZ *krkil- 'moth': Georg, rkil- 'moth'; Megr. ki(r)kil-, kikit-. The modern Georgian lexeme underwent simplification. Its Megrelian equivalent preserves an ancient word-initial k; the initial cluster of the
100



*krko
protoform is reflected here in the regular way. Its variant with the final t
(cf. also Megr. katit-) must be secondary; r may be missing. The word confirms that the Georgian-Zan *CiiCi- meant rather 'small insect'. \\USKJa: 116.
GZ *krko- 'acorn': Georg, rko- 'acorn'; Megr. hi-, ka-, (r)ku-. The word is found also in Old Georgian (Abulage 1973: 348). In modern Georgian dialects forms occur with an old initial consonant (Tus. kurko-, Psav. girko-) as well as with a simplified consonant cluster (Ajar., Imer. ko- Oak tree'). This cluster is fully simplified in the Zan forms. A similarity of the word to the "dialectal" Indo-European designation of the
V
oak tree (cf. Lat quercus) is registered in Sanise (1947: 3-4). \\&SKJa: 116.
GZ *krox- 'to cluck (about a sitting hen)': Georg, krux- 'to cluck (about a sitting hen)'; Megr. kux-; Laz kljux-, k(r)ox-. At best the stem comes from a later Georgian-Zan stage as the hen itself could not have been known in the Caucasus in the Common Kartvelian period. There are no clear phonetic equivalents in the languages. As a rule there is no r in the Zan forms, whereas in the Laz correspondence the vowel ο is usually combined with it. It has been assumed that the stem is of nominal origin (cf. Cikobava 1938: 299). | | Cf. USKJa: 116.
GZ *krox- 'brood hen': Georg, krux-, krox- 'brood hen'; Megr. [krux-]; Laz krox-.
The lexeme cannot be older than the Georgian-Zan unity since this kind of poultry penetrates into Caucasus comparatively late. It is related to the verb stem krox- 'to cluck (about a sitting hen)'. The form knit-, found in Georgian mountain dialects (see yionti 1984: 311) and in Megrelian, repeats the analogous "area norm" of the languages of the Northern Caucasus. In Laz the lexeme has a limited sphere of use (usually in both Zan languages another stem moncva— is found). The resemblance to PIE *krok- in the designations of birds (cf. Pokorny 1959: 568) deserves attention
\\USKJa: 117.
CK(?) *krt-wn- 'to pluck (out), nip: Georg, krtn- 'to pluck (out), nip'; Megr. kirton—, ksrtan— 'to peck'; Laz kirton—; Svan kartdn— (?).
101



*k(r)cxi
The verb stem is well attested in Old Georgian (dahkrtnnian guelni prteni... 'they are nipping out old wings...' Krest 281.36; action noun krtna-}. The stem is formed by suffixation of *-wn to a simple base *kert— : krt— 'to peck'. The Zan cognates (cf. Megr. action noun kirtonua-) regularly correspond to the Georgian form. Cf., however, the parallel Georg, kortna- 'to peck'. The*genetic status of the Svan stem (action noun li-karten-e) remains unclear. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 568). Laz, Svan: USKJa: 116.
GZ *k(r)£xi- 'to scream': Georg, cx-iv- 'to scream, cry (about birds)'; Megr. rcx-v- 'to cry,squeal'; Laz cx-i-. In Old Georgian the stem is found in the shape of krcx-: cf. ikrcxialna '(she) screamed, cried' alongside reduced form krxial- 'scream' (Sar^velaje 1995: 101).The modern Kartvelian forms reflect its simplification: cf. action nouns Georg, cxiv—il—, Megr. rcxviap—, Georg.-Zan *cxikw- 'jay' may be its derivative (if metathesized). The stem has an obvious descriptive character. The question arises whether Svan cacx-an(< kacx-l) 'to croak' is related to it. || Georgian, Megrelian: Sardschweladse (1985: 23). Cf. USKJa: 221.
CK(?) *krcxa- 'branchy knot': Georg. (Psäv.) kircxa- 'a branchy knot'; Svan (Lasx.) arcxal— 'knots, branches'. A problematic comparison. There are simplified forms rcxa- and cxa(yionti 1984: 457)with similar meaning in Georgian dialects (Kax., Tus., Imer., etc.). The Svan word (cf. also Upper Bal arsxal, asxal) may be related to the Georgian one: its final —(a)/ seems to be a historical diminutive affix. For a non-organic initial a in the Svan form cf. *zywar-, *kud-, qba-, etc. The lexeme appears to be a parallel formation to *gr$Ya~. Other connections proposed for the Svan word run against more serious phonetic difficulties. If our protoform holds it may underlie the nouns *ne—kercxa— and *krcxib-.
GZ *kriixib- 'prickly (insect, animal)': Georg, kircxib- 'lobster'; Megr. girgyibe- 'tick'.
A tentative comparison. The word occurs in the Georgian medieval literature. For modern language it is recorded in Psav. dialect. Cf. also Gur. zyiba- 'tick' (yionti 1984:787),which might be borrowed from a Zan source. The archetype seems to be a derivative of *krcxa-.
102



*krc
GZ *krö- 'to grit': Georg, krc-en- 'to grit'; Laz kirc-, A continuant is recorded in Old Georgian. In Laz it can be extracted from the verb o-kirc-ol-u 'to grit'. As a result of the presence of the velar element in the stem there is no development of the expected k after c. The relation to *krec- : kric- : krc- 'to cut off' remains unclear. Similarity to Arm. krcel with the same meaning is ascribed by Acaryan (1973: 683) ascribes to its descriptive nature. | | Sardschweladse (1987: 19).
GZ *ku- 'tortoise': Georg, ku-, kuv- 'turtle'; Megr. ku-. The word is attested in Old Georgian: kuvi zyvisaj... 'turtle of sea...' Physiologus 184: 24. The final v might be a recent development. A dialect form rku— with a secondary r is found in Georgian. There are no traces of the lexeme in Laz. Since the animal does not exist in Svanetia, parallel Svan ku- does not seem to be native.
CK *kud- (//kwed-) 'tail': Georg, kud- 'tail, end'; Megr. kudel-\ Laz kudel-; Svan hakwäd, häked, akwed, akwat.
Attested in Old Georgian (danakis kudi 'date', literally 'the tail of a knife'). The Zan form element -el might be a historical estimation suffix. The existence of the initial syllable (h)a- II ha- in Svan deserves attention. Topuria assumes the Svan form to be a loanword from Georgian (cf. Topuria 1979: 96). Rogava (1978: 122) derived the word through a misunderstanding from Lat. cauda 'tail'. Cf. the exactly opposite assumption in Charachidze (1986: 219). | | Georgian, Svan: Janashvilli (cf. Erckert 1895: 295). Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 92).
GZ *kut- 'to moan (weakly)': Georg, kut- 'to moan (weakly), to pipe (about a thrush)'; Megr. kut—; Laz kut— 'to moan (weakly)'. Compare *kwes- : kws- 'to moan'. There is an additional meaning 'to pipe' (speaking about a thrush) in Georgian and Megrelian (action noun kutua-). In Laz the stem is enlarged by an extension (action noun o-kut-in-u; mkutiner- 'frightened'). I | Klimov (1985: 171).
GZ *kutx(u)- 'angle': Georg, kutxe- 'angle'; Megr. ku(n)txu-, kurtxu-; Laz kuntxu-.
The lexeme is attested in Old Georgian, where it is known in the form kutx-; cf. also its derivative otx.-kutx.-ed- 'quadrangle' (Abula3e 1973:
103



*kukul
205). It is one of the nouns showing the correspondence Georg. 0 ~ Zan u in word-final position (cf. also, *nek(u)-, *ret(u)-, *kec(u)-, *yom(u)-). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Deeters (1927: 13)
GZ *kukul- 'bud, burgeon': Georg, kukur-, kokor- 'bud, burgeon'; Megr. kvikvil— 'bud'; Laz kukul—, Tentative reconstruction since the phonological correspondence Georg. r ~ Zan / at the end of the word is very unusual. The Georgian variant with the vowel must be secondary. The lexeme is of a sound-symbolic type: cf. Arm. kokon, Russian kokon, kokor' with the same meaning. Cf, however, Acaryan (1973: 618) treating the Georgian word as a borrowing.
CK *kum- 'to press (on lips, fist)': Georg, kum- 'to press (on lips, fist)'; Svan kum 'dumb'. Problematic equation. If it holds, the verb stem may belong to the Common Kartvelian level. Its somewhat unusual phonetic shape (especially taking into account the canonical structure of the Kartvelian verb stem) makes one doubt the validity of the comparison. | | Fähnrich (1987: 37).
GZ(?) *kumin- 'to moan, grumble': Georg, kmin- 'to moan, grumble'; Megr. kumin-.
In Old Georgian the verb stem may be identified in the action noun kuminva- (Sar|vela3e 1995: 102). Its morphological structure remains obscure. In modern Georgian a parallel variant gmin- is attested. As there is no Laz equivalent the Megrelian form (action noun kuminua-) may be a Georgian loanword. | | Fähnrich (1982: 35-36).
GZ *kurka- 'stone (of a fruit)': Georg, kurka- 'stone (of a fruit)'; Laz kurka- 'grain, stone (of a fruit)'. The variants gurka- and kurka- are attested in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 103). Cf. also modern Georgian dialectal forms burka- and kurko(yionti 1984: 93, 316). The word seems to have been lost in Megrelian. | | Georgian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 144).
CK(?) *kurcx- 'hail': Georg, kurcxal- 'tears'; Megr. kircx-, ksrcx'hail'; Laz kicx—; Svan kicx 'fragment, scrap'.
104



*kutu
Rather attractive but problematic comparison. If correct, the proto form must be a Common Kartvelian word. The Georgian form is characterized by formerly suffixal -al and a semantic shift. An ancient Kartvelian designation of tears seems to have been *c\reml-. 1 1 Megrelian, Svan: Macavariani (1969: 160). Georgian: Fähnrich (1980: 73).
CK *kutu- 'boy, penis (pueri)': Georg, kuta- 'boy'; Megr. kutu- 'penis (pueri)'; Laz kutu-; Svan kötol, köcol 'little'. The lexeme is found in Western Georgian dialects: cf. Gur., Imer. kuta'boy' (in Imer. it means 'penis pueri' as well). In Megrelian a derivative kutula- 'boy' is encountered. In the Svan cognate the word-final / must be a later diminutive suffix (the ancient / must have been lost at the end of Svan substantives). For the correspondence Georg.-Zan u ~ Svan compare *w-, *qur-, *subl-, etc. The adjectival use of the stem in Svan seems to be secondary. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Savaxisvili (1950: 205-206). Svan: USKJa: 118.
CK *kupx- 'drop, small scrap': Georg, kupxal- 'a small scrap of a bunch of grapes'; Laz kumx-, Svan kwipx- 'a drop'. In Old Georgian the lexeme is attested with the meaning 'grain' (Abulase 1973: 206). According to Cikobava the combination mx, which is found in Zan, must reflect an earlier shape of the word. No Megrelian equivalent has been discovered. The word belongs to a series of substantives with formerly suffixal —al in Georgian (cf. *bark—, *bur^g-, *maq\v-, and others). Cf. also Georg, kupxa-kupxad 'in a stream'. The semantic shift may have taken place in the Georgian-Zan branch, where the word is an element of viticulture terminology. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 134).
GZ *kuc,- 'to shred (into small pieces)': Georg, kuc- 'to shred (into small pieces)'; Megr. kucUnattested in Old Georgian. The Megrelian cognate may be extracted from the adjective kucu- 'small, low', where -u is a word-forming element. Cf. lib-u- 'soft' alongside *lab- : Ib-, tib-u- 'warm' alongside *tep- : tp-, etc.
| | Penrixi-Sarlvelaje (1990: 195).
105



L
GZ *lab- : Ib- 'to become tender, soft; to moisten': Georg. Ib- 'to make something tender; to moisten'; Megr. lib-', Laz lob- : lib-. The verb stem is well represented in Old Georgian (action noun molboba-: rtoni misni molbian... 'her branch becomes tender...' Mk. 13.28). Contrary to Laz the Georgian and Megrelian cognates reflect only the zero ablaut grade. The Laz word-form do-lob-in-u 'he made it soft' allows us to reconstruct the full ablaut grade of the stem in the shape of *lab-. There is a Georgian-Zan derivative adjective *lb-il-. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 123). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 302-303).
CK *lag- : Ig- 'to plant': Georg, lag- 'to put' : rg- 'to plant'; Megr.
[rg-]; Laz [rg-]; Svan la$- : l$- 'to plant; to attach, fasten'. The verb stem attested in Old Georgian. The Zan equivalents are found under *rg-'to plant', which has formed the basis of a special lexical unit. The variant rg- derives from the zero grade of the stem Ig-. Svan action noun is li-l$-eni. For the affricatization of g see *gab- : gb-, *gwel-, *gsi- : gusi-, etc. The similarity of the stem to PIE *legh- 'to put, to lie' deserves attention (cf. Vogt 1938: 337). \\USKJa: 118.
GZ *lal- 'to drive out the cattle to graze'; Georg, lal- 'to drive out the cattle to graze; to send (about people)'; Megr. hi-. The verb stem is not found in Old Georgian. In modern Georgian it is
a dialectal (Kartl., Kax., Xevs., Tian.) form; cf. the action noun ga-lal-v-a (yionti 1984: 119). For its semantics cf. Xevs. cxvar galales zvavze... '(they) sent the sheep to the snow-slip...' and calal mamam svil... 'the father sent the son...'. Megrelian action noun is lolua-. \ | Fähnrich (1982: 36).
GZ *lal- 'to singe ( a bird, a pig)': Georg, lal- 'to singe (a bird, a pig)';
Megr. hi-, lul- 'to smoke, fill smth. with smoke'. In Old Georgian the verb stem has not been found. At present it occurs as a dialectal (Imer.) item (ylonti 1984: 321). The Megrelian variant with M-vocalism can be due to the influence of the neighboring /. Cf. also Megr. hi- 'smoke'. | | Fähnrich (1984:43).
106



*lal
GZ *lal- 'to bark': Georg, lal- 'to argue, to quarrel'; Megr. lal- 'to bark'; Laz lal-.
Well attested with the meaning 'to quarrel' in Old Georgian texts (ilalvides urtiertas... 'they strove among themselves...' Jn. 6.52). The Zan languages retain the original meaning of the stem (cf. the action noun Megr. lalua-, Laz o—lal—u). The identity of its vocalism in the languages as well as its proximity to the reduplicated PIE Schallwurzel *lal(l)a(without reduplication - *la-, le-) canbe explained by the onomatopoeic origin of the stem. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 301-302).
GZ *layw- 'fig': Georg, leyw- 'fig'; Megr. luy-; Laz luy-. It is also known in Old Georgian (ixiles leywi igi... 'they saw the figtree...' Mk. 11.20; cf. the derivative leyu—sulel- 'a wood fig', leyovan'the place where fig-trees grow'). To explain the vocalism of the Zan equivalent it is natural to proceed from the original *a (cf. Gudava 1960: 120). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 77). Laz: Caraia (1918: 162).
GZ *laqe- 'rotten': Georg, laqe- 'rotten'; Laz loqa- 'sweet'. Unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language a parallel form mlaqe— is also known. While the phonetic correspondences of the compared forms are regular, their semantic difference can be explained by assuming a metaphorical shift in Laz. Another comparison for the Laz word in Penrixi-Sar|vela3e (1990: 201-202). 1 1 Fähnrich (1980: 73).
GZ *laS- 'lip': Georg, las- 'lip (of animal), mouth'; Megr. leckv— 'lip'; Laz lesk—.
In Old Georgian it may be identified in las-parto- 'large-lipped' (Sar3vela3e 1995: 102). The word is widespread in such Georgian dialects as Kax., Psav., Xevs., Moxev., Kiz. (yionti 1984: 325). The Laz form is close to the Georgian one. For the correspondence in the vocalism cf. *tqaw-, *$aml-, *^aryw-. In the Megrelian word we are faced with a later phonetic development (possibly under the impact of some other
stem?). Another opinion in Cikobava (1938: 52). It is tempting to connect the word with the verb stem *ls-wn-. Cf. Cuxua (1991: 91). | | Rosen (1845: 30).

GZ *lb-il- 'softened, soft (about inanimate objects)': Georg, rbil- 'soft'; Megr. libu-, hbu-; Laz libu-.
The adjective occurs in the earlier form Ibil- in Old Georgian (guakus enaj Ibili... Our language is soft...' Sin. mr. 281.14). Georgian r results from dissimilation in the sequence /-...-/. Other modern Georgiandialectal forms are bil-, mbilo-, mbila- (ylonti 1984: 74, 354). The lexeme is a historical participle with the word-formation affix *-il. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 123).Laz: Cikobava (1938: 302).
GZ *IeZiW- 'saliva': Georg, lezv- 'saliva'; Megr. lezva-a- 'mouth foam'; Laz lezv-.
While the consonantal correspondences are regular, the vowels may have to be accounted for by umlaut effects in the Zan languages. The Megrelian form shows later affixal -a; compare also Megrelian attributive lezv-am- 'slobbery' with suffix -am. The form lezv- is used by speakers of Laz in Abxazia. The stem may also be extracted from Laz lezv-er- 'mouth foam, saliva'. Its connection with Osset. liwzce 'moist, slippery, dirty' (cf.Andronikasvili 1966: 75) or Arm. lizel 'to lick' (cf. Acaryan 1973: 278) is difficult to accept. | | Georgian, Laz: F hnrich (1975: 341). Megrelian: Klimov (1988: 20).
GZ *lekw- 'puppy': Georg, lekv- 'puppy'; Megr. lakv-; Laz lak-, lac'dog'. Well attested in Old Georgian (vitarca lekuman lomisaman 'as a lion's whelp' Gen. 49.9). The final w is lost in Laz, where the affrication k > c also takes place. There is also a shift of meaning here (for 'puppy' Laz has lakot-, which according to Acaryan (1973: 261) may be a source of Arm. lakot with the same meaning). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103).Laz: Marr (1909: 072). Cf. also Tseretheli (1959: 93).
GZ *lel- 'cane': Georg, lel- 'cane'; Megr. [lar-]. The word is found in Old Georgian (Abulage 1973: 208). It forms the base of the derivative *ler-clem-. In the Zan languages its correspondence may be identified only through the latter form. ||Rogava(1945:231).
GZ *lele- 'silly, stupid': Georg, lele- 'silly, stupid'; Megr. /α/α- 'ider, coward, lazy-bones'.
108



*ler-c,em
Unattested in Old Georgian. In the Imer. dialect of Georgian the meaning of the word coincides with the Megrelian one (yionti 1984: 328). The correspondence in the word-final vocalism points to its historically attributive use. The reduplicative structure presupposes the descriptive origin of the word. | | Fähnrich (1985: 27).
GZ *ler-C!em- 'reed': Georg, lercam-, lelcam- 'reed'; Megr. larcam-.
The word is well attested in Old Georgian (hscemdes mas tavsa lercmita 'they smote him on the head with a reed' Mk. 15.19). It must be treated as a compound, containing the stems *lel- and *c\em-. The parallel variant larcem- is found in Megrelian. The lexeme may have been lost in Laz. | | Rogava (1945: 231). Cf.USKJa: 121.
GZ *les- 'to rub, sharpen': Georg, les- 'to sharpen'; Megr. las- 'to rub, to prevent (from listening)'; Laz las-ir-, las-ij- 'to rub, sharpen'. A verb stem well represented in Old Georgian (ayilese enaj sent 'You did sharpen your tongue' Bal. 8.36; action noun lesva-; past participle aylesil- 'sharpened'). The stem is widely known in Megrelian (action noun lasua-; lasir- 'rubbed off'), where the original meaning has been preserved. In Laz it may be extracted from the derivative verb stem o-lasir-u 'to sharpen', formed in its turn from the ancient participle formation with the affix *-//. The dependence on Arm. lesul 'to crumble, crush' (see Acaryan 1973: 277) is difficult to accept. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 107). Laz: JZSKJa: 121.
CK *leqw- : Iqw- 'to thaw, to melt': Georg, lexv- : lx(v)- 'to thaw, to melt'; Svan leqw- : Iqw-. Verb stem. The two grades of the original ablaut alternation are preserved in both languages. Action nouns are Georg. Ixoba- and Svan li-leqw. There is also a secondary stem with -vocalism in Svan. 1 1 Z . Chumburidze.
GZ *lip- 'to fashion, model; to slip': Georg, lip- 'to become slippery'; Megr. lip- 'to fashion, model; to slap smb. (in the face)'. Verb stem. In Georgian (action noun lipva-) a passive participle molipul— 'slippery' is also known. Cf. also the dialectal (Kiz.) adjective
109



*lok
lip- 'slippery, smooth'. In the Sam. dialect of Megrelian there is an action noun lipua-. The symbolic character of the stem seems to be plausible. Hence its proximity to the PIE verb base *leip- : lip- 'to stick, smear' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 670).
CK *lok- 'to lick': Georg, lok- 'to lick'; Megr. lok-, lo(n)tk-\ Laz lo(s)k-; Svan lök-, lak-.
Verb stem of an onomatopoeic nature. It is attested in Old Georgian (...da icqo lokaj misi'.. .and began to lick him' Bal. 37.9). The base (cf. action noun li-lok-e) underlies probably Georg, lokokina- 'snail'. In the Zan branch the forms with (ri)tk and sk clusters (action nouns Megr. lo(t)kua-, Laz o-lo(s)k-u- need explanation. The Svan variant with a long vowel (cf. action noun li-lök-e) may point to stem simplification. Similar onomatopoeic stems are widespread in different linguistic families: cf. PIE */a&-, Sem. *laqq-, Esk. alluk, Maya lekak, Finn, latkia, | | Rosen (1845: 429), Cikobava (1938: 303).
GZ *ltw- 'to wet, to get wet': Georg. //- 'to soften (by wetting)'; Megr. T(v)-.'
The verb stem is well represented in Old Georgian: da daalto igi... 'and he softened it...' Lev. 2.6; the aorist form of the 3 person da-a-lt-o (< *da-a-ltv-a) points to the age of w in the stem. Cf. also the Old Georgian action nouns lt-ob-a- and da-(y)lt-ob-a- 'to wet, get wet'. The Megrelian form (action noun rtv-op-a-) reflects a change / > r in the consonant cluster. An archetype *wlt- seems also admissible. 1 1 T . Gudava.
GZ *lukupxa— 'breakable buckthorn': Georg, lukupxa— 'breakable buckthorn'; Megr. lukuxa-, lekuxa-; Laz lukwnxa-, nukwnxa-.
Possibly a Georgian-Zan term unattested in Old Georgian. Its wordformation structure is not transparent. If the word is not borrowed, it may have as a second component either *kupxa- or *pxa-. | | Cikobava (1938: 130-131).
GZ *lul- 'to doze, sleep': Georg, lul- 'to doze, sleep'; Megr. lur-, rul'to sleep'; Laz lir- 'to doze'. The verb stem in the form nil— is well known from Old Georgian texts (mierula qovelta 'they all slept' Mt. 25.5; ml- 'drowsiness'). Georgian and Zan cognates underwent dissimilation of l...l (Cikobava 1938: 302).
110



*lumb
The Laz form points to a vocalic shift u > i. Vogt (1954: 544) considered the stem to be of sound-symbolic nature. Cf. Russ. / 'uli, Norv. lulle Vogt (1954: 544). I | Georgian, Megrelian: Marr (1914: 43). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 302).
CK(?) *himb- 'to get wet': Georg, lump- 'to get wet'; Svan [lamb-] 'be wet, moist'. A problematic comparison. In Georgian this verb stem has a dialectal use: Gur. ga-lump-v-a- 'to get wet'(ylonti 1984: 121). Its Svan correspondence may be extracted from the adjective mo-hmb 'wet, moist'. The abruptivization b >p must have an expressive function (cf. Georgian-Zan *cumb- with the same meaning). One cannot be sure of the genetic nature of the parallelism. I 1 Fähnrich (1985: 27).
GZ *lS-wn- 'to eat (rudely)': Georg, losn- 'to kiss (rudely)'; Megr. riskon-, raskon- 'to gorge, to nibble'. Two variants of the verb stem are known from Old Georgian losn- and lusn— (gaylnica movidodes da hlosnides cqlulebata mista 'the dogs came and licked his sores' Lk. 16.21: cf. action noun los(n)a- alongside aylusos '(he) will eat (it) up'). Being in position before w original *s is reflected in Zan languages as sk in accordance with Gamkrelidze's law
(Gamqrelise 1959: 51 sqq). The Megr. i-vocalism reflects the zero grade of the stem: this explains the transition l>r (action noun riskonua-). The vocalic alternation II u of the Georgian forms is secondary (cf. also Georg, kortn- 'to peck' alongside *krt-wn-). For the semantic history of the stem cf. also Georg, loslos— 'to eat (greedily)'. 1 1 USKJa: 122.
M
CK *m- word-formation prefix: Georg, m- participial prefix; Megr. [m-]; Laz [m-]; Svan m(d)-. Formerly the prefix seems to have been highly productive, which has resulted in a number of substantives produced by it. This word-formation type is best preserved in Svan: cf. ma-gyir 'wet', ma-kar Open', ma-txeli 'seeker', ma-ket 'friend, lover', etc. The participles with m- are very
111



*m e
common also in medieval Georgian: m-kvet- 'sharp', m-sven- 'standing in beauty', m-cen- 'visible', and others. In the Zan languages the purely prefixal formation ceased to exist. 1 1 Deeters (1930: 224-225).
CK *m— -e word-forming circumfix: Georg, m e; Svan m e. The productivity in Old Georgian is beyond doubt: cf. m-n-e'manager', m-r-e- 'conqueror', m-c-e- 'assistant'. In modern languages the circumfix is used to derive verbal nouns of substantive and adjectival function. In the Zan languages it was lost, since the initial m- in combination with the following consonant of the stem does not survive here. In Svan the circumfix remains to be productive (cf. ms-cm-e 'mower', ms-gc-e One who holds', ma-tr-e 'drinker'). | | iSKJa: 124.
GZ *m -el- word-formation circumfix: Georg, m el-; Megr. m α/-; Laz m α/-. The circumfix derives names of individuals from toponyms. While in Georgian this word-formation type may be observed in a number of examples (seeCikobava 1942: 144-145), in the Zan languages, especially in Laz, it has a limited productivity: cf. *m-egr-el-. Cf. also *m-ced-el- 'smith, blacksmith', which raises a question on the meaning of this circumfix. ||Brosset(1849:70).
CK *ma- 'what' (pronoun): Georg, [ma-] 'what'; Megr. mu-; Laz mu-; Svan maφ, m j.
In Georgian the pronoun ceased to be used as a free form already at the time of the first written monuments of Old Georgian (it seems to be extractable in the form romel- 'which'). In the Zan languages it occurs in its unbound shape: cf. Megr. mus ragadans? 'what is he saying?', Laz mu ptkval 'what am I to say?'. Cf. also Megr. namu- 'which', muta'nothing'. The pronoun also exists in Svan (m j xekwesl 'what did they want?'). The Zan reflex regularly corresponds to the Svan one: the historical a next to a labial consonant is often reflected here as u (cf. *matl-, *sam—, *Yame(n)—, and others). | |USKJa: 124.
CK *ma- pronominal stem of the third person: Georg, ma-; Megr. mu-; Laz mu-; Svan [m(a)-].
112



*ma
The pronominal stem is widely attested in ancient Georgian sources (man hrkua mas 'he said to her' Ruth 3.18). Its vocalism is regularly differentiated in languages (in the Zan branch the expected ο gives u next to the labial). In Svan the stem does not occur in unbound state at present, but it can be extracted from the Common Kartvelian derivative *a-ma-. | | Georgian, Laz: Bopp (1846: 263). Megrelian: Cikobava (1936: 73). Svan: USKJa: 124.
CK *ma- word-forming element: Georg, [ma-] word-forming element; Megr. [mo-, mu-]; Laz [mu-]; Svan ma-.
A prefix found mainly in present participles. It was apparently still functioning in Old Georgian; at present it is productive only in Svan: cf. ma—ζογ 'leader of a choir', ma-sad 'assistent, rescuer', ma-gad 'harvest, yield', etc. In the Zan languages its vocalism undergoes assimilation to the labial m. The prefix may be discerned in *matl- 'worm'. 1 1 Penrixi-Sar3vela3e (1990: 207).
CK *mad verbal negative particle: Laz mo(t) verbal prohibitive particle; Svan mad(e), mod(e) particle of modal negation. Lacking in Georgian. In the Zan languages it exists only in Laz: mo caruml 'do not write!'. In Svan the particle is found with a number of phonetic variations: isgu dagra maku made Ί don't want to kill you' (Sv. P. 66.18). | | &SKJa: 124-125.
GZ *make- 'heavy': Georg, make- 'heavy with young (about a female animal)'; Megr. mo(n)ka- 'heavy'; Laz monka-. The adjective occurs in Old Georgian (ganera makej igi mati 'their cow with calf saved' Job 21.10). The vowel correspondence is regular. The form with the secondary insertion of« is found in the Zan languages; cf. the Megrelian derivatives si-monk-a- 'heaviness', monkatu- 'pregnant'; the last word is historically a form of the adverbial case. See Cikobava (1938: 242). The meaning of the Zan cognate is primary. The verb stem *maken— is connected with the lexeme. | | Megrelian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 37). Georgian: Kipsidze (1914: 281).
GZ *maken- 'to get heavy, pregnant': Georg, maken- : makn- 'to get pregnant'; Laz monkan-. The verb stem may have been formed from nominal *make- (Cikobava 1938: 304). It occurs also in Old Georgian (razams makndebodes
113



*mama
cxovarni... 'when ewes were conceiving...' Gen. 31.10). The historical presence of en in the stem (theMegrelian present tense form a-monkan-s 'grows heavy' contrasting with the aoristic form di-monk-u is considered to be extended with a thematic affix) is confirmed by the Laz form of the aorist di-monkan-u '(it) grew heavy' (cf. Contes: 19.3). The phonetic correspondence of the cognates is regular. | | &SKJa: 125.
CK *mama- 'father': Georg, mama- 'father'; Megr. muma- (plural mutnal—); Laz [muma—]', Svan mü.
The kinship term is well known from Old Georgian (ert ars mamaj tkueni One is your Father' Mt. 23.9), where there exists a number of derivatives. / of the Megrelian plural form is secondary. In Megrelian compounds the stem occurs as mua—: cf. mua—ckim— 'my father'. In Laz it may be identified in the derivative mumul- (see *mama-l-). Its Svan continuant shows a simplification: the long ü must point to the loss of the word's final material. Cf. also the form of the adverbial case mua—d. The word belongs to the nursery lexicon, hence its analogies in some other languages (cf.Avar emen (< emem), Lak mänma, and others). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Rosen (1847: 408). Cf. also Rosen (1845: 29).
GZ *mama-l- 'male': Georg, mamal- 'male, cock'; Megr. mumul-; Laz mumul—, mamul—.
The word is attested in Old Georgian texts (mamalad da dedalad sekmna igini 'he made them male and female' Mt. 19.4). It is formed from *mama- with the suffix -/. The Zan vocalism regularly corresponds to the Georgian one in adjacency to the nasals. The Svan mamäl- with the same meaning stems from the Georgian. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 8). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 98).
GZ *mama-m-til- 'father-in-law': Georg, mama-mtil- 'father-in-law (husband's father)'; Megr. mua-ntir- 'father-in-law (husband's father, wife's father)'; Laz mtir—. Despite the formally correct correspondences the attribution of the material to the Georgian-Zan stage remains doubtful. The word is known from Old Georgian (cf.Abula3e 1973: 214). It must be treated as resulting from addition of the deverbative formation from *til— to *mama-. Compare analogous *deda—m—til. Megrelian knows a variant mua—ntil
114



*ma(n)cw
(with nt originating from mf). The absence of the first component in Laz remains unclear. The comparison causes some other difficulties. Svan mimtil- must have been borrowed from Georgian with substitution of the first component. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 37).
GZ *ma(n)iw- 'badger': Georg, macv-, mancv- 'badger'; Megr. tnu(n)ckv-; Laz munck(v)-, muncx—, muncq—, mumckv-.
Attested in Old Georgian (da macwi... 'and badger...' Lev. 11.6). In modern Georgian dialects a variant marcv- is also known. Zan u in proximity to nasal regularly corresponds to Georg, a (cf. Gudava 1960: 120). Laz variants with a final consonant cluster ex and cq are of later origin. Svan minckw 'badger' derives from the Zan form through an intermediate stage miinckw. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 112). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 90).
GZ *martwe- 'young one': Georg, martve- 'cub (of animal or bird)'; Megr. mota— 'grandson'; Laz mota—. The word is known in Old Georgian: katamman seikribnis martueni... 'a hen gathereth her chickens...' Mt. 23.37. One gets the impression that the lexeme is a historical adjective of verbal origin. There are its derivatives bozo-mota- 'girl' and motal- 'animal's young' in Laz. Arm. monf 'pupil of the church school' is considered a loanword from Zan (cf. Kapancjan 1975: 370). | | Georgian, Zan: Lomta^e (1961: 263-268).
CK *marcqw- 'strawberry': Georg, marcqv- 'strawberry'; Svan bäsq-, bäsqi—.
The term is found in its Old Georgian form in the dictionary by S. Orbeliani. A derivative character of the word is not precluded. In the Zan languages it seems to be lost, which may be ascribed to the climatic conditions in Megrelia. Svan b derives from m. For the spirantization of the affricate in Svan see also *grcqil—, *cqw-. ||Marr(1922:20).
CK *mar^w- 'to conquer, overcome': Georg. mar$w- 'to conquer, to defeat'; Megr. morggv-; Laz [mar^gv—]; Svan [mursgw—].
The verb stem is attested in Old Georgian (sadamca visme hmar^uda... 'where it was comfortable for one...' Xan3. 30.11). Ancient
115



*mar|w
3 before w is regularly reflected in Zan as $g, according to Gamkrelidze's law (Gamqrelise 1959: 28 sqq). In Laz and Svan'the stem does not occur independently and can be identified only in the continuants of the derivative *mar^w-en~. | | ESKJa: 128.
GZ *mar|w— 'adroit, comfortable': Georg, mar^ve— 'adroit, comfortable; Megr. mar$gv- 'successful, accurate'. The adjective is well known from Old Georgian (e$iebda zamsa mar$uesa 'he sought the opportunity' Mt. 26.16), where it had a number of derivatives. It may be viewed as an earlier participle *m-mar$w-ewith the circumfix *m e added to the verb stem (see *mar$w-). For Megrelian cf. its derivative adverb mor^gv-as 'adroitly, neatly'. | |ESKJa: 128.
CK *ma-r|w-en- 'right hand': Georg, margvena- 'right hand, side'; Megr. mar$gvan-; Laz mar$gvan-, tnarckvan- 'the right hand'; Svan mursgwen— 'the right hand, side'. The form mar$uene- is known from Old Georgian texts (carhkueta quri mar$uenej 'he cut off his right ear' Lk. 22.50). It is formed with the affix *-en from the verb stem *mar$w- (root *r$w-). The first-syllable vocalism in the Zan forms seems to be assimilated to the continuants of *marC]X-en-. The sg sequence in Svan regularly reflects old before w. In Svan, parallel forms lersgwen and lärsgwän, pointing to the prefixal character of the segment ma-, are found. For the further analysis of the stem see Rogava (IKE XXV, 1986: 32-38). Marr (1911-1914 VI: 419) considered the Svan lexeme to be a loanword from Zan languages. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 298). Laz: Marr (1936: 65).
GZ *mase— 'fish-net': Georg, mase— 'sort of fish-net'; Megr. mosa'net'; Laz mosa- 'net, fish-net'. In modern Georgian the word does not seem to occur, but it can be found in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani. The correlation of vowels at the end of the Georgian and Megrelian forms needs explanation (if the lexemes were of substantive type their final vowel identity could have been expected). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 199). Laz: Caraia (1918: 223).
116



*ma-tl
CK *ma-tl- 'worm': Georg, mail- 'worm'; Megr. muntur-; Laz muntu(r)-, muntr-; Svan mat.
The lexeme is well attested in Old Georgian (math mati ara daesrulebis 'their worm dieth not' Mk. 9.48). It must be taken to be a nominal derivative with a prefix ma- from the verb stem *tl- 'to gnaw (about worms)'. Georgian / and Zan ur regularly reflect an old /. The original vowel underwent a change a > o > u in Megrelian in proximity to the labial. The vocalism of the Svan form needs explanation. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Wardrop (1911: 634). Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 109. Laz: Marr (1915.1: 828).
CK *matql- 'wool (of sheep), fleece': Georg, matql- 'wool (of sheep); Megr. montqor-, Laz montko(r)-; Svan mätq, matq.
The word is attested in Old Georgian: spetak iqo witarca matqli 'they were as white as wool' Bal. 23.34; cf. its derivative matq(l)ier- 'woollen' (Abula3e 1973: 220). The lexeme may be of a derivative origin; Deeters (1955, 32) assumed it to be related to *tqaw- 'skin'. The original stemfinal / is regularly reflected in all the forms. The Laz inter-dialectal correspondence reflects the q > k process. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 109). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 95). Svan: Wardrop (1911: 634).
CK *maqw- 'blackberry': Georg, maqval- 'blackberry'; Megr. mu'-, mu'e; Laz muq-; Svan muqw-.
The lexeme occurs in Old Georgian texts (ese talari ars da ara maquali 'it is a temple but it is not blackberry' Sin. mr. 26.9; cf. also its derivative maqulo(v)an- 'blackberry shrub'). The Zan forms originating from *maqw- (cf. Gudava 1960: 120) may point to the secondary character of Georg, -al. Svan wiyw of the same meaning (cf. Sara3eni3e 1991: 127) may hardly be accepted as a regular correspondence of the Georg.Zan forms. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Marr (1911-1914 II: 824). Laz: USKJa: 129. Svan: Penrixi-Sar|vela3e (1990: 211-212).
GZ *maxa- 'sort of wheat': Georg, maxa- 'sort of wheat'; Laz moxa-. The agricultural term represented in Georgian dialects (Lecx., Raca). There are no traces of it in Megrelian. The Laz correspondence was noted in Marr (1910: 168). A possibility of reconstructing an underlying form *maqa- cannot be ruled out, especially if we take into account material
117



*me
parallelisms in Nax-Daghestanian languages (cf. Chechen and Ingush tnuq, Cez maqa, Darg. muqa alongside Archi maxa 'barley'). The word seems to reflect an old cultural property. 1 1 Kaxa3e (IKE XII, 1960: 191-Γ95).
CK *me- word-forming prefix: Georg, me—; Megr. ma-; Laz ma—; Svan me—.
The prefix derives forms with the meaning of the names of origin and occupation. At present the prefix can rarely be found without additional affixes: cf. *me-c}wel-. The additional affixation is available in the forms: *me e, *me el, *me al. The prefix seems to be connected with the prefix m-. Its historical connection with the pronominal stem *ma- is quite possible (cf. the analogy in derivation of Semitic participles and names of instruments and places with the help of the prefix etymologically originating from a pronominal stem meaning 'what, which'). At present the prefix has an active use in Svan.
GZ *me al - word-forming element: Georg, me al; Megr. ma ol.
Old Georgian had only a minimum of lexemes containing it. The analogous formations are better represented in Megrelian. Below this element is illustrated by the substantive *me-clrx-al-.
CK *me e - word-forming element: Georg, me e; Megr. ma-a; Laz ma a(n); Svan me e.
The circumfix is well known from Old Georgian, where it formed nominal derivatives: cf. me-zuer-e- 'tax-collector', me-etl-e- 'coachman', me-vep-e- 'story-teller' (cf. below *me-(u)p-e- and *me-px-e-). As for the ordinal numerals which are formed in Kartvelian languages after the same model (cf. Georg, mesame-, Megr. masuma-, Svan mesme- 'third') they are rather a parallel formations which arose separately in the various languages.
GZ *m-egr-el- 'Megrelian': Georg, megrel- 'Megrelian'; Megr. margal-, Laz margal— (?).
Attested in Old Georgian (cf. Cikobava 1942: 144), where its derivative Sa-megrel-o- 'Megrelia' is also found (Sar|vela3e 1995: 176). Derived with the help of the circumfix *m el from the stem Egr(is)denoting a part of Western Georgia in the Ingur River basin. The *gr > rg

*mel
metathesis is typical of Megrelian. The borrowing from Georg, megrel- is now used in Laz; the Zan form proper, found in the Laz texts from Abxazia (arti kortu, mazura margali... One is a Georgian, the other, a Megrelian...'(?T4 76.6), is most likely a loanword from Megrelian. 1 1 Georgian^ Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 70). Cf. Berise (1920: 23). Laz: ESKJa: 132.
GZ(?) *mel- 'fox': Georg, mela- 'fox'; Megr. [ma/-](?)· The form mel- without the final estimation suffix -a is well known from Old Georgian (utxarl melsa mas... 'tell that fox...' Lk. 13.32). There exists also the form melia- with the estimation suffix *-ia. Contrary to Megr. mela- and Laz mel- which can hardly be native, the Svan forms mal— and ma(l)w— seem to go back as loanwords to the Zan proper *mal-. Dzaukyan (1967.1: 93), Rogava (1984: 106) and others treat the word as an ancient Indo-European borrowing: cf. PIE *(s)melo'small animal' (Pokorny 1959: 724). | | Georgian, Svan: Wardrop (1911: 605). Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 89).
CK *men T: Georg, me T; Megr. ma; Laz ma(n); Svan mi. The variants me and men of the pronoun are found in Old Georgian (didebul var men... Ί am glorified...' Jn. 17.10; mces mepuri... '(he) will give me bread...' Gen. 28.20). The final n that can easily be reconstructed for the Georgian-Zan period (cf. also dialectal Georg, men, mend) probably dates back to even more ancient times. Cf. Gamqrelize (1959: 44). | | Rosen (1847: 411, 412), Bopp (1846: 289).
GZ *me-r£x-e 'shallow (about water), rare': Georg, mecxer- 'rare'; Megr. marcxa- 'shallow (about water)'; Laz mancxa- 'gutter'. The adjective must be a derivative with the circumfix *me e based on the verb stem *recx- : rex- 'to murmur, to purl'. The Georgian form is characterized by r-metathesis. The Zan forms illustrate the intra-Zan correspondence r ~ n. The semantic difference of all words does not preclude their comparison. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 586). Laz: Klimov (1973: 362).
CK *me-(r)£ed- 'finger-ring': Georg, beced- '(finger-)ring; signet ring; stamp' (?); Megr. marckind '(finger-)ring'; Laz mac(k)ind '(finger-)ring, wedding ring'; Svan maskad '(finger-)ring'.

*meser
The lexeme is found in Old Georgian (seacut becedi qelsa missa 'put a ring on his hand' Lk. 15.22). It is tempting to consider it a derivative of the verb stem *ced- : cd- 'to hammer in' with the prefix *me-. The correspondence Georg, c ~ Zan ck ~ Svan sk points to the antiquity of the Megrelian variant with r (cf. also *ywl-erc- 'earthworm'). The meaning 'signet-ring, stamp' attested for the Georgian lexeme (if it has no relation to similar Iranian and Armenian word) reflects a later development. 1 1 Zan, Svan: Marr (1912: 32). Georgian: Deeters (1937: 275).
GZ *meser- 'palisade; stake': Georg, meser- 'palisade'; Megr. masar'stake'; Laz masar-. The lexeme does not seem to be attested in Old Georgian texts. The reason for the occurrence of final r instead of $ expected in Zan forms remains unclear provided the correspondence of vocalism is regular. The analogous Svan maser-, meser- must have been borrowed from other Kartvelian languages. The possibility of adopting the lexeme from a nonKartvelian language is not ruled out. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 146).
GZ *me-up-e- Owning, owner': Georg, mepe- 'tsar, ruler, king'; Megr. mapa—; Laz [mapa—].
A social term reflected by mepe- and meupe- in Old Georgian (meupej miuvaln sxuasa meupesa 'a king makes war against another king' Lk 14.31). It is a derivative with circumfix *me e based on a verb stem *up-. In Georgian dialects there occurs also a variant nepe-. The correspondence Georg, e ~ Zan a in word-final position points to its former adjectival nature. In Laz it can be recognized in the toponym Mapa-ckari 'King-source' (cf.CT\l 4.18, 19, 36). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII:103), Marr (1914: 72). Laz: USKJa: 133.
CK *me-px-e- 'clear sky,fine weather': Laz mapxa- 'clear sky, fine weather'; Svan mepxe, mäpxe. The word seems to be a derivative with the circumfix *me e based on a verb stem *px- with a vague meaning. There are no traces of it either in Georgian or in Megrelian. The correspondence Laz a ~ Svan e in word-final position of a substantive requires explanation. | | Cikobava (1938: 188-189).

*me-c,wel
GZ *me-c,wel- 'milked, milch': Georg, mecvel- 'milch'; Megr. macval-; Laz mancvalu-.
The word is derived from the verb stem *C{wel— 'to milk' with the help of the prefix *me-. The correspondences between Georgian and Megrelian cognates are regular. The word-final u in the Laz form remains quite unclear (the n of the latter has undoubtedly a secondary character). 1 1 USKJa: 133.
GZ *me-c1rx-al- 'swallow': Georg, mercxal- 'swallow'; Megr. marcixol-, macrixol-, macir(i)xol-.
Well attested in Old Georgian (guritman da mercxalman... 'a turtle dove and a swallow...' Sin. mr. 226.20). It is a derivative with the circumfix *me al based on the verb stem *clirx- : c^rx- 'to twitter'. Thus the original meaning of the word must have been 'twittering, chirping'. Cf. Megr. sosia marcixol-i 'nightingale-bird' (Berije 1920: 150.21-25). The change of the glottalized c\ to the aspirate c in a stem of the onomatopoeic type is admissible. | | Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 297). Cf. Gudava (1964).
CK *mzie- 'sun': Georg, mze- 'the sun'; Megr. bza-\ Laz \mza-, bza-]; Svan maz, miz. The word is attested in Old Georgian (yitarca mzej aymoqda... 'when the sun was up...' Mk. 4.6). bze- and ze- forms occur in Georgian dialects (cf. yionti 1984: 71, 230). The Zan continuants with b are secondary (cf. *mzi\vare-). The original vocalism e is corroborated by the genitive form of the Svan word mQze(s) and Megr. Sam. zesxa- 'Sunday'. The correspondence Georgian e ~ Zan a can be accounted for by the possibility of an attributive use of the lexeme still in the Georgian-Zan period. In the past some arbitrary reconstructions of the protoform have been proposed. Cf. Marr (1908: 3). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Rosen (1845: 34). Svan: Gren (1890: 139). Laz: Janashvili (see Erckert 1895: 285).
CK(?) *mziware- 'sunny side': Georg, mzore- 'sunny side'; Laz (m)zora—, bzora-, zura— 'sun'; Svan: mazar 'sunny'.
In Old Georgian texts the lexeme occurs in the form mzuare- with the meaning 'East' (Abula3e 1973: 239). It is a derivative based on the nominal stem *mz,e— 'the sun'. In modern Georgian it is represented by the forms mzore- and mzor- of the Moxev. dialect and by the form
121



mzvare- of the Tian. dialect (yionti 1984: 361). In Laz the lexeme has acquired the meaning 'sun'. The relation of Svan mszar 'sunny' to this material needs clarification. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1985: 23).
CK *mziYW- 'to press, crumple, squeeze': Georg, mzyv-l- 'to break'; Svan mzy(w)- 'to press, crumple, squeeze'. A verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language it occurs as a dialectal (Raca) form: the action noun da-mzyvl-ev-a (cf. yionti 1984: 178). The complex consonant structure of the stem may suggest its historically complex character. The Svan action noun is li—mzY-un—e.
1 1 F hnrich (1985: 27).
CK *mt- 'cold'(?): Georg. [mt-\ 'cold'(?); Megr. [/-]; Svan \nt-}. Common Kartvelian stem with an uncertain meaning. At present it can be identified only in derivatives: compare, on the one hand, Georgian-Zan *za-mt-ar- 'winter' and, on the other, Svan lintw (Upper Bal), lunt (Lasx.) 'winter'. It is semantically contrasted to the stem *px- which may be extracted, in particular, from Georg, za-pxul- 'summer'. The absence of old designations of spring and autumn in the Kartvelian languages indicates that the ancient Kartvelians distinguished only two main seasons.
| | USKJa: 134.
GZ *mi- preverb of direction meaning 'aside from the speaker': Georg. mi—; Megr. mi-, me—; Laz me-.
The preverb may etymologically be related to the objective prefix */»of the first person (cf. also the preverb *mo-). It is well attested in Old Georgian: cf. mivrdoma- 'to rush (there)', mirbola 'to run (there)', mislva— 'to come, to go (there)'. The e vocalism of the Zan form, which is especially stable in Laz needs an explanation.
GZ *mkal- 'grasshopper, locust': Georg, kalia- 'grasshopper, locust'; Megr. kol—\ Laz mkol—, nkol-.
In Old Georgian the word occurs in the form mkal— (camda mkalsa... 'he ate locusts...' Mk. 1.6). Old Georgian and Laz forms show the primary character of the initial m. The final -ία in Georgian is the estimation suffix frequently found also in other designations of
122



*mkerd- : mkrd
small animals and insects. According to A. Cincarauli (IKE XXIII: 130) the lexeme derives from the present participle *m—mk—al'harvesting'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895: V). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 113).
CK *mkerd- : mkrd- 'breast, chest': Georg, mkerd- 'breast, chest'; Megr. kidir-, kadar-; Svan mscwed, mucod.
Well represented in Old Georgian (icemda mkerdsa da itqoda... 'smote upon his breast, saying...' Lk. 18.13). The age of the word-initial m is proved by Georgian and Svan forms. For its loss in Megrelian cf. *mkal-, *mcad-, *mxal-, *mqar-, and others. In Svan the process k > c is usual. The stem's similarity to PIE *kerd- : kerd- 'heart' is worth noting. Cf. Gamkrelidze-Ivanov 1995: 775. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cikobava (1942: 99). Svan: Deeters (1930: 44), SSKJa: 135.
GZ *m—kwax—e- 'unripe, sour': Georg, mkvaxe— 'unripe, sour (about fruit)'; Megr. koxa- 'unripe (about grapes)'; Laz koxa- 'unriped grapes, sour juice of unriped grapes'. The lexeme, lacking in Old Georgian texts is found in Georgian medieval literature (cf. Rustaveli 207.4). In the dictionary of S. Orbeliani it is listed with the meaning 'unripe fruit'. The word seems to be a formation derived from the unattested verb stem *kwax-. The Zan forms have lost the initial m (compare, however, Laz mcoxa— 'sour'); here the development wa > is quite common. The Svan forms kux, küxw are likely to have been borrowed from the Zan source. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 292). Laz: USKJa: 109-110.
GZ *m-kl-e- 'deprived, lacking': Georg, mokle- 'short'; Megr. [kule-] 'deprived'; Laz mkule- 'short'. Derived from the Common Kartvelian verb stem *kel- : kl- 'to lack; to be short of with the circumfix *m e. The word is registered as mokle- in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 265). Dialectal Xevs. mkleis a more regular Georgian correspondence to the Zan word. The Megrelian equivalent can be extracted from compound xe-kule- 'deprived of a hand', e at the end of the Zan word is preserved since it is substantivized. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 229).
123



*mo
GZ *mo- preverb of direction with the meaning of 'in the direction towards the speaker': Georg, mo-; Megr. mo-; Laz mo-. Contrasts with the preverb *mi- (see above) in meaning. It is widely attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abu^e 1973: 259-292). In some modern Georgian dialects its parallel form ma— can be found: cf. Xevs. kac mowed 'the husband came'. The prefix is likely to be somehow related to the first person objective prefix *m-. 1 1 Deeters (1930: 14).
GZ *mo-zrd-il- 'grown, grown-up': Georg, mozrdil- 'grown-up, adult'; Megr. mordil- 'grown, brought up, (well) bred'; Laz morde(r)'grown-up, big'. Deverbative formation. It may be viewed as an original participle in *-i7 based on the verb stem *zard- : zrd- 'to grow'. In Laz, owing to analogy with later attributive formations, the old suffix is replaced by -e(r). | | USKJa: 136.
GZ *mo-rgw- 'ball, skein': Georg, morgv- 'ball, skein'; Megr. murgv-; Laz murg- 'ball, lump'. In Old Georgian the word morgu- is attested in the meaning 'potter's wheel' (Abulage 1973: 273). By its origin it is a prefix derivative from the verb *gor- : gr- 'to wheel, to roll'. In Megrelian its reflex is preserved also in the adjective murgva- 'unpleasant, disagreeable, elusive, tricky (of humans)'. In Laz the word often refers to a skein of silk thread. The Zan form is reflected in Georgian (Gur.) murg- 'skein of thread or rope'. | | Klimov (1985: 171).
CK *mos- 'to get dressed, put on': Georg, mos- 'to get dressed, put on'; Svan msw- 'to cover oneself with smth.; to get dressed'. The verb stem is widely attested in Old Georgian: samoseli ara seemosa... '(he) wore no clothes...' Lk. 12.27 (action noun semosva—, cf. derivative sa-mos-el- 'clothes'). The Svan action noun is li-msw-i. The labial element of the Svan stem underwent a metathesis. 1 1 Fähnrich (1984: 43).
GZ *mo-£r—il— 'cut off': Georg, mocril— 'cut off'; Megr. mockiril—. Occurs in Old Georgian (cf. Abulaje 1973: 290). It is a past participle in -il based on the verb stem *cer- : cr- 'to cut, chop, fell'. The Megrelian equivalent regularly corresponds to the Georgian form.
124



*mzyr
GZ *mzyr- 'to wither, fade': Georg, mzyr- 'to fade (about flowers)'; Megr. (b)zyir-, (fyzyar— 'to fade'; Laz $yir- 'to rot'. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian sources. The initial m in Georgian seems to be original since its antiquity can be proved probably by word-initial consonant in Megrelian (action noun (b)zyirapa-) and the z > 3 process in Laz (cf. $yirer- 'rotten'), which could be explained by former vicinity of z to m. The reflexes of stem-final r are regular. The semantic connection between the cognates is evident. | | iSKJa: 137.
GZ *m-rt-el- 'safe, intact, healthy': Georg, mrtel- 'healthy'; Megr. tar-. The word is well known from Old Georgian texts (Abula3e 1973: 294). It is a derivative of a verb stem *rt— 'to unite, to join, to connect' (Vogt 1954: 542), which is also present in *ert— One'. In the Megrelian equivalent the consonant cluster is simplified. The other correlations between the forms are regular. Georg, mtel- 'whole' is a lexicalized variant of the stem. | | Kipsidze (1914: 240). Cf. Marr (1936: 63).
GZ *m-(s)iw-al- 'point, thorn': Georg, mcval- 'colic (in the body)'; Laz mckul-, mckil- 'sharp; thorn, wedge'. In Old Georgian the stem can be discerned in the structure of the derivative sa-mscual- II sa-mrcual- 'nail'. The word is a derivative from the verb stem *(s)cw— 'to hammer in, stick in'. Concerning the sound correspondence between Georg, cv and Zan ckv see Kartozia (1990: 39—42). | | Kartozia (ibidem).
CK *msxal- 'pear': Georg. (m)sxal- 'pear'; Megr. sxul-; Laz cxul-\ Svan wicx, (yv)icx(w) (pi. stem ucx—).
In Old Georgian it occurs in the form ofsxal—. In modern dialects also the form psxal- is known. The initial m is reconstructed here because of the change of expected ο into u in Zan (see Gudava 1960: 121) as well as in view of the affricatization s > c in the consonant cluster in Laz and Svan. In the latter word-final / underwent regular change > w > 0. Topuria assumed a prefixal nature of the Svan i (cf. Topuria 1979: 98). 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Brosset (1849: 76). Megrelian: Caraia (1895XII: 103). Laz: Marr (1912.1: 37).
GZ *(m)sixw-il- 'stout, big': Georg. (m)sxvil- 'big, large'; Megr.sxu-, sxu- 'stout, fat'; Laz {m)cxu-.
125



*mtwer
In Old Georgian alongside the adjective msxwil- (Sar^velase 1995: 151) the form of the comparative u-msx-o 'more, larger' (Abula3e 1973: 426) is also attested. Modern Georgian has variants psxvil-, sxvil- and sxil-. For the correspondence between Georgian -// and Zan 0 see *srsw-il-, etc. A number of circumstances supports the antiquity of the Georgian extended form: cf. the lengthening of Megrelian final u, the Megrelian plural form sxul-ep-, the Laz plural form cxvel-epe-. Affricatization of the spirant is found in the Laz consonant cluster (cf. also *zisxl-, *msxal-, and others).
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 61). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 231-232).
GZ *mtwer- 'dust, whirlwind of dust': Georg, mtver- 'dust, whirlwind of dust'; Megr. tver—, Laz mtve(r)—, mtver-.
The lexeme is well known in Old Georgian: miiyo Mose mtueri igi... 'and Moses took dust (ashes)...' Ex. 9.10. The Georgian and Laz forms support the antiquity of m posited at the beginning of the word. The reflexes of we are regular in all languages. In some dialects the Laz correspondence means also 'ashes'. The similarity of Kartvelian material to the PIE verb stem *tuer- : tur- 'to turn, to whirl' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 1100) is striking. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 36). Laz: Schuchardt (1902.2: 393).
GZ mtil- 'greens, vegetables': Georg, mtil- 'kitchen-garden, garden'; Megr. [rtil-, rtvin-] 'greens, vegetables'. Found in Old Georgian (mtilsa mas... 'in the garden...' Jn 18.26). In the Zan branch it can be identified in Megr. o-rtil-, o-rtvin- 'kitchengarden'. Laz o-ntul-e 'kitchen-garden' does not belong here (cf. Arm. btuf 'fruit'). There are even less reasons for identifying the lexeme with Svan (f)artam—, lertäm— 'greens'. | | lavaxisvili (1934: 98-100).
GZ *mtkaw-el— 'span, inch': Georg, mtkavel— 'a span —distance between thumb and little finger extended'; Megr. tku-, tkü-, tkou-; Laz mtko-, mtku-, (m)tu-.
The word is attested in Old Georgian texts (Abula3e 1973: 299). It belongs to the lexemes supporting the correspondence Georg. -(y)el ~ Zan -u. The Georgian and Laz forms point to the antiquity of the initial
126



*muql
m. Similar Svan lexemes (kamal, kamin and others) must have been borrowed from Georgian. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 113). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 75).
GZ *muql- 'knee, corner': Georg, muxl- 'knee'; Megr. muxur- 'corner, edge'. The lexeme is well known from Old Georgian (seuvrda muqlta lesujsta 'he fell down at Jesus' knees' Lk. 5.8). Old Georgian and some modern Georgian dialects show the priority of q over x. Old */ is reflected regularly. The semantic similarity of the Georgian and Megrelian forms seems obvious. In comparing the word with Georg, mxare'side' Marr and some other researchers face insurmountable phonetic difficulties.

CK(?) *my- 'moth(?)': Georg, my-il- 'moth, a small worm'; Svan my-ul 'insect'. The word is found in Old Georgian: area myilman ganrqunis... 'neither moth corrupteth...' Lk. 12.33. The Georgian and Svan cognates have different derivational affixes (the final / of the inherited stem could not have been preserved in Svan). | | Fähnrich (1982: 36).
GZ *mqar- 'strong, sound, solid'; Georg, mqar- 'strong, sound'; Laz
•·
pez—.
An adjective well attested in Old Georgian (cf. mixwidet mqarsa mas kldesa... 'come to the solid rock...' Sin. mr. 156.18). The initial sequence mq regularly yields p in Laz (compare *mqen- : mqn-). At the end of the stem the unusual Zan development r > z (instead of regular j) is found. For the replacement of expected Zan by e see *oc,-, *yor-,
\ | G. Kartozia.
GZ *mqen- : mqn- 'to graft': Georg, mqen- : mqn- 'to graft'; Megr. "On-, Laz mpon- 'to graft, cross'. A verb stem attested in Old Georgian: action noun damqna- (cf. Abulase: 117). In Georgian the stem shows two ablaut grades. As in *gr—ex— : gr-ix—, *ckend— : chid—, *cer— : cr—, the Zan forms reflect the
127



*ms(i)
full grade of the parallel underlying vocalism a. The age of m in wordinitial position is supported by Georgian and Laz forms. In Laz (action noun ge-mpon-u) p has developed through the interaction of m and q. If the analogous phenomenon in Megrelian is taken into account (cf. puns < mquns Ί have'; piluns <mqviluns Ί ambeing killed, sth. finishes me'), Laz action noun o-mpon-u can be compared with Megr. ponua- 'to lean against, put against'. The Svan stem mqin- (action noun li-mqin-e 'to graft, inoculate') is likely to be borrowed from a Georgian source. 1 1 Georgian and Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 142). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 306-307).
GZ *mS(i)- 'to be hungry': Georg, si- 'to be hungry'; Megr. skir-, sksr-; Laz (m)skir—, (m)sko(r)—.
Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian where in the most ancient texts it has the form msi- (cf. netar xart, romelta gmsiis 'blessed are ye that hunger now' Lk. 6.21; action noun mseva-, simsil-). The Georgian and Zan forms (cf. action noun Megr. skirena-, skirenul- 'hungry') indicate the priority of word-initial m, which was later eliminated from the stem because of its homophony with the objective prefix of the first person m-. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 360). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 368).
CK *m-§w-e- 'child': Georg, [mso-] 'child'; Megr. skua- 'son'; Svan sge(j), msgefi), she 'child (boy)'.
The Georgian continuant is represented in the Old Georgian compound pir-mso- 'first-born, elder' (sva $ej igi misi pirmsoj 'brought forth her firstborn son' Lk. 2.7), where the second component is a derivative from the verb stem *sew— : sw— with the circumfix *m e. In Georgian a development we > ο took place. In Megrelian m has been lost; s before w regularly yields sk in Zan and sg (> sk) in Svan. See Gamqre^e (1959: 59-60). In Svan the glide w has been lost. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Marr (1911-1914 VI: 421). Megrelian: Gamqreli3e (1959: 60).
CK *m-Swen- 'beautiful, beauty': Georg, msven- 'beautiful, wonderful'; Megr. skvam—, skvam—; Laz mskva—, mskvalina—, pskva—; Svan musgwen. The Old Georgian continuant is represented by the derivative formation suen—ier— 'standing in beauty'. The lexeme is formed with the
128



*mswild
prefix m- (found in numerous substantives) from the verb stem *s\v-en-, Cf. modern Georgian msvenier- 'beautiful'. The end of the Zan word is transformed. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Schuchardt (1902.1: 295). Laz: Lafon (1929: 161).
GZ *mSwil- 'to shoot (an arrow): Georg, msvil- 'to shoot (an arrow)'; Megr. skvil-.
The Georgian continuant is known from Old Georgian texts (Abulaje 1973: 305). The verb stem is likely to be derived from the noun *mswild'bow' with the final consonant cluster simplified. ||Caraia(1918:IX).
GZ *m$wild- 'bow': Georg, msvild-, svild- 'bow'; Megr. skvil-, skvind'bow, catapult'. The word is well known from Old Georgian texts (ac ayiye ... mswildi 'Now take ... a bow' Gen. 27.3) where it had a connotation 'rainbow' (Sar^velaje 1995: 155). Compare also Georgian dialectal (Tus.) psvind-. The Megrelian forms have lost m and reveal a change *5 > sk (instead of expected sk) before the wi syllable (Kartozia 1984: 138-140). The final d could be lost here under the impact of the compound skvildosagan(< skvild-do-sagan-) 'bow and arrows'. Cikobava's view differs from this (cf. Cikobava (1938: 99). 1 1 Caraia (1918: IX), Cikobava (1938: 99).
GZ *mcire- 'little, small': Georg, mcire- 'little, small, few'; Megr. cira'guT.
The lexeme is widely represented in Old Georgian texts (twirti cemi mcire ars 'my yoke is easy' Mt. 11.30). The word looks like a verbal derivative with the circumfix *m e. The correspondence Georg, e ~ Zan a at the end of the adjective is regular. Certain authors recognize the connection of the Georgian word with the Svan stem hwr-: cf. li-hwr-e 'to decrease in weight'. Cf. Topuria (IKE XII, 1960: 156). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 73).
GZ *mc,en- : mein- 'to leave (to), charge, entrust': Georg, mcen- : men- 'to leave (to), command'; Megr. ein— 'to leave (to), charge, entrust'; Laz mein- 'to entrust bequeath'. Verb stem well known from Old Georgian texts (man mamcno me 'he gave me the commandment' Jn. 13.49; compare mcneba- 'com
129



mandment'). The Zan forms (cf. action noun Megr. docina-) reflect the zero grade of the stem. The Megrelian consonant cluster has lost wordinitial m (cf. *mkal-, *msixw~il-, *mcire-, *mc\er-, and others). The stem is likely to be derived from *c\an- : c^n- 'to know'. | | Georgian, Zan: Macavariani (1961: 258).
CK(?) *m3ave- 'rancid (nut)': Georg, m$aye- 'rancid (nut)'; Megr. 3uye-; Svan η&$ΐγ- (?).
Cf. also Georgian dialectal (Gur.) $aye- (ylonti 1984: 684). The Megrelian form's vocalism gives evidence of the loss of the word-initial m (cf. Gudava 1960). The history of the vocalism in the second syllable of the Svan correspondence makes its relatedness somewhat doubtful and gives grounds to see in the Svan word a borrowing from Megrelian. The structure of the lexeme resembles the deverbative formations containing the circumfix *m e. | | Georgian, Svan: Macavariani (1965: 25). Megrelian: Klimov (1973: 363).
GZ(?) *m-3,ew-al- 'foundling (egg)'; Georg, nqeval- 'foundling (egg); hostage'; Megr. $α(α)1~. In Old Georgian texts the word is attested in the secondary meaning 'hostage' (Abulase 1973: 307). It is probably a derivative with the circumfix *m al. However, the identification of its root with the verb stem *$ew- : jw- 'to lie (about inanimate objects)' entails great difficulties because of word-initial $ in Zan. ||Kipsidze(1914:411).
GZ *m31iy- 'fist': Georg, mgiy- 'fist'; Megr. $ix-\ Laz mjix-, n$ix'fist, handful'. The form mgiy- (da aces mgiyita... 'and will strike with fist...' Ex. 21.18), which is typical of modern Georgian, is already found in Old Georgian. However, the variant m$iy- preserved in S. Orbeliani's dictionary parallel with the Zan equivalents makes it preferable to assume & in the archetype. The Georgian and Laz forms point to the priority of m in word-initial position. In the Zan forms y undergoes devoicing. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 62).
GZ(?) *mcikw- 'to soil, to make dirty': Georg, mcik- 'to soil'; Megr. c//c(v)-; Laz cikv- (?).
130



*mcqat
A problematic comparison since the inherited character of the stem in the Zan languages is difficult to prove. If the comparison holds, the stem may date back to the Georgian-Zan period. It is attested in Old Georgian (mcinkulita semyebe me 'Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch (filth)' Job 9.31). The Megrelian form has lost the initial m. The final v often disappears here: cf. the action noun cikua-, cikvil- 'dirty' (ar^ok dicifo 'everything has become dirty'). Apparently the Laz form has been registered only with native speakers living in Georgia (kamuicikveen 'he became dirty'). | | USKJa: 140.
GZ *mcqat- 'salt, salted'; Georg, \mcqat-} 'salt, salted'; Megr. cqst-. In Georgian the stem can be extracted from the dialectal (Lecx.) derivative na—mcqat—o 'saline solution for conserving brynza (sheep's cheese)' (yionti 1984: 408). For Megrelian cf. adjective cqat-am'salt(ed)' and cqat-kvar- Oversalted flat cake'. | | Sardschweladse (1987: 20).
GZ *mciare— 'bitter': Georg, mcare— 'bitter'; Megr. [cor-]. Probably a Georgian-Zan adjective. In the same shape the word is represented in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 309). In Megrelian it can be discerned in the verb gito-cor-apa- 'to remove a bitter tast'. The phonetic correspondence is regular. The lexeme contains the historical word-formation circumfix *m e. | | Berise (1956: 247-248). Cf. Gigineisvili (1984: 34).
CK *mc1er- 'insect, fly': Georg, mcer- 'insect'; Megr. can$-, cand'fly'; Laz mca$-\ Svan mer. The word is widely known from Old Georgian texts where it meant 'fly' ($aylis mceri 'dog fly' Ex. 8.21, 31). In all probability it is formed from the verb stem *c,er- 'to scratch; to depict, portray' with the help of the word-forming prefix m- (Penrixi-Sar|vela3e 1990: 204). The Megrelian correspondence has lost m (cf. the preceding entries), while the Svan form shows a compensatory vowel lengthening due to the loss of a glottalized affricate (for the latter process in Svan see *c}ad- : c\d-, *c}am-, *c\er- : c,r-, etc.). Already Marr stated that Arm. cane-, can^- 'fly' which can be found in the fifth-century texts is a Zan loanword (cf. also Kapancjan 1975: 370; Acaryan 1977: 184-185). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Riabinin (1897: 21). Laz: Marr (1909: 072). Svan: (Wardrop 1911:605).

*mc,q
GZ *mciq- 'to train (to), break in': Georg, mcq- 'to break in (cattle)'; Megr. ncq-\ Laz mck-, ck- 'to train (cattle)'. The verb stem is well known from Old Georgian sources: cf. u-mcq(v}'unbroken', the action noun damcqa- (Abula$e 1973: 118). For Megrelian compare the action noun mcquala— and attributive uncqapu— 'unbroken' with changed nasal. Svan li-ncq-i 'to break in, tame, curb' is likely to be borrowed from Megrelian, because instead of the expected spirant (cf. *nerciqw-, *c:qar-, *Ciqwed-, etc.) it shows the affricate.
| fCindeliani (1969: 9), Kartozia (1979: 63-64), Gigineisvili (1981: 131-136).
GZ *mc1q-es-: mcjq-s- 'to pasture, shepherd (cattle)': Georg, cqes- 'to pasture (cattle)'; Megr. cqes-, cqis-\ Laz mckes-, mces-, ces- 'to guard, watch'. The verb stem's continuant in Old Georgian still had the initial m (qnvides an mcqsides... 'plowing or feeding cattle...' Lk. 17.7; action noun mcqsva-). The Laz forms also confirm the age of w. The stem may perhaps be considered as a derivative from the stem *mciq- extended by the historical enlargement *-es : -s. The history of its vocalism remains rather obscure: the Zan e II i is likely to reflect the zero grade. In the Zan word the process s > s seems to be the result of distant assimilation to the preceding hushing consonant. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 265). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 412-413) with different conclusion.
GZ *mciqes- 'shepherd': Georg, mcqems- 'shepherd'; Megr. cqis-, cqas—, cqes—', Laz mckes—, mces—.
The lexeme is well known from Old Georgian texts (davsce mcqemsi... Ί will smite the shepherd...' Mt. 26.31). Cf. also Georg, (dial.) cqes-. It may be treated as a derivative noun with prefix m— formed from the verb stem *mciq-es- : mc^q-s-. The phonetic history of the word is similar to the history of the preceding stem. Its specific feature is the secondary m in word-internal positon in the Georgian form. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 96).
GZ *miad- 'bread (of millet), churek': Georg. (m)cad- 'bread (of millet), churek'; Megr. chid-, ckdd-, Laz (m)ckud-, (m)ckid-.
The lexeme occurs in Old Georgian texts, where it had a form cad(me cadi makvs camad Ί have bread to eat' Jn. 4.32). Cf. Georgian
132



*mcaxe
dialectal (Ing.) cat-. The Laz forms point to the priority of tn, which is also confirmed by the vocalism of the Zan variants, where u alternates with i (cf. Gudava 1960: 121). The Svan forms ckid-, cksd-, ckdt- point to a Zan source. As a cultural term the word is known in some other languages of the Caucasus (Arm. cat', Kryz. cat, Lak ccat, Avar ced). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 112). Laz: Marr (1912.1: 34).
GZ *miaxe- 'sour': Georg, mcaxe- 'sour'; Laz mcoxa-. The adjective can be found in Old Georgian in the form mcax(Abula3e 1973: 312). The archetype resembles the formations provided with the derivational circumfix *m e. However, its underlying root remains unknown. The k expected after the affricate does not develop in Laz because of the presence of a velar consonant in the word. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1987: 20).
GZ *m-ied-el- 'smith, blacksmith': Georg, mcedel- 'smith, blacksmith'; Megr. ckadu-. Occurs in Old Georgian: misca igi mcedelsa... 'gave it to the smith...' Jg 19.4. It is derived from the verb stem *ced- 'to hammer in' with the help of the circumfix *m el. The cognates are phonetically regular, although the Megrelian form underwent simplification of the word-initial consonant cluster. The expected Laz equivalent is displaced by a Turkish loanword. Similar Svan maskid— 'smith' reflects another word-forming type. | | Rogava (IKE IV,1953: 47).
GZ *mfcle- 'lean, skinny, thin': Georg, mcle- 'lean, thin'; Megr. ckola-. The adjective occurs in Old Georgian texts (.. .da mcleni qorcita '...and leanfleshed' Gen. 41.3). The lexeme may belong historically to deverbal derivatives with a circumfix (see *m e). The initial m is regularly lost in Megrelian. The correspondence between Georg, e and Megr. a in wordfinal position in an adjectival form is regular. The presence of ο in the Megrelian word needs explanation. The Megrelian form of the equative ma-ckol-a 'as lean as...' led Rogava (IKE IX-X, 1957: 99-100) to the assumption that in the Georgian word as well we have a former equative form of the analogous type. According to Acaryan (1977: 204) Arm. clel 'extreme leanness' may have a Georgian source. 1 1 Caraia (1895 XII: 112).
GZ *mxal- 'vegetables, greens': Georg, mxal- 'greens (edible)'; Megr. xul- 'kohlrabi'.
133



*mxar
A lexeme attested in Old Georgian (mxali iqo sazrdeli mata 'their food was greens' Job 30.4). A dialectal form pxal- occurs in Georgian. In Megrelian word-initial m was lost, as indicated by the u—vocalism (cf. Gudava 1960: 122). The Laz correspondence has not been found. A comparison with Svan ipx- 'a sort offern' is rather difficult semantically. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 112).
GZ *mxar- 'to eat': Georg, mxar- 'to eat (in the evening)'; Laz mxor-, pxor—, mpxor—.
In Georgian the verb stem has been preserved only in the derivative sa-mxar- 'dinner', which is also known from Old Georgian (Abulage 1973: 356). The first Laz form corresponds regularly to the Georgian one. The final r remains invariable as in other verb stems. For an alternative view see Penrixi-Sar^velase (1990: 232). 1 1 Machavariani.
GZ *mxul- 'lizard': Georg, mxuliv- 'lizard'; Megr. xvi(l)ar-, xolar-, xvelar—; Laz mtxola(r)—, xolura—.
The Georgian form is found in Old Georgian texts (da mxulivi 'and the lizard' Lev. 11.30). The Georgian and Laz lexemes retain the initial m. In Laz t is patently secondary. Only the root part of the word can reflect a common protoform. For the modern Georgian designation of lizard see *ywl-ek- : ywl-ik-.
| | Georgian, Megrelian: Schmidt (1962: 125). Laz: USKJa: 144.
CK *mqar- 'shoulder': Georg, mxar- 'shoulder'; Megr. xu$-\ Laz (m)xu^-, pxug—; Svan meqer 'the part of the arm between shoulder and elbow'. In Old Georgian the lexeme occurs in the form mqar- (ayikida mqarta twista... 'took upon her shoulders...' Gen. 21.14). In Georgian dialects a variant pxar- is found. Cf. also Moxev. mqar- 'measure of length'. Loss of m in Megrelian is indicated by M-vocalism indirectly (cf. Gudava 1960: 121). The Georgian and Svan correspondences require a reconstruction with q. The vocalism of Svan meqär- and meqar— is secondary. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 75). Laz, Svan: Marr (1909: 071).
CK *mqw- 'to overthrow, overturn': Georg, mx- 'to overthrow, overturn'; Megr. xu—; Laz*«— 'to throw, splash out'; Svan nqw— 'to overthrow; to fall'.
134



The verb stem is attested in Old Georgian (tablebi igi daamqua '(he) overthrew the tables' Jn. 2.15; cf. the action noun damqueba-). The modern Georgian forms (action noun damxoba- and daamxo < da-a-mxv-a 'he overturned it') point also to an etymological w in the root. Whereas in Zan m of the stem was lost (cf. Megr. action noun xuapa—), in Svan (action noun li-nqw-ί) it underwent change to n. The antiquity of q is evident. The Zan stem shows a deviation from old semantics.
| | USKJa: 149.
CK *mqcie- 'grey hair': Georg. (m)xce- 'grey hair'; Megr. ce- 'white'; Laz (K)ce-, xce—, eke—; Svan meci Old man'.
The lexeme is widely represented in the form mqce- in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 316), where there is also a derivative mqcovan— 'greyhaired' (see *m-qci-oan-). The age of the word-initial m needs no commentary. The Megrelian stem has been simplified (the former q is vestigially reflected here in the Laz forms). The identity of the Georgian and Zan word-final e points to the fact that historically the lexeme was a substantive. | | Georgian, Zan: Marr (1912.1: 39^0). Svan: Macavariani (1965: 113).
GZ *mqci—oan— 'hoary with age': Georg, mxcovan— 'hoary with age'; Megr. rcin(u)— Old man, old woman'; Laz xcin—, kein— Old woman'. Known from Old Georgian texts (Abulaje 1973: 316). It is derived from *mqcle- with the help of the suffix *-oan. In the Zan word the suffixal part is simplified. | | Cikobava (1938: 40).
N
CK *n- 'to want, desire, wish': Georg, n- 'to want, wish, desire'; Laz n-; Svan n-. Verb stem amply attested in Old Georgian: cf. minda sekrebaj nasobta sentaj Often would I have gathered thy children together' Mt. 23.37; undo ganteveba lesujsi... 'willing to release Jesus...' Lk. 23.20 (the action noun is neba- 'wish, will'). In Megrelian the stem is re

*na
placed. For Laz cf. u-n-on 'he wants', mi-n-on Ί want'. In Svan it is rarely found: erxis xo-n-dax sgimxan lizi 'some wished to leave the source' (Sv. P. 178.12). 1 1 USKJa: 145.
CK *na- word-formation affix of the past participle: Georg, na-; Megr. no—; Laz [no—]; Svan no—.
A word-forming prefix very common in Old Georgian participles (which often function also as substantives): cf. ηα-parev- 'stolen', na-tex- 'broken, broken off' na-sob- 'born'. In the Zan languages it can be identified in some old verbal formations (see below *na-wal-, *na-kwerciX—al-, *na—perck—). The Svan affix is highly productive to this day: cf. na-kid- 'taken', na-szm 'heard'. | | Georgian, Svan: Deeters (1930: 227-228). Megrelian, Laz: USKJa: 145.
GZ *nad- 'collective help (assistance) in agriculture': Georg, nad'collective assistance'; Megr. nod-; Laz node(r)-. The agricultural term is attested in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 317). Since the Zan forms' vocalism shows a regular correspondence to Georgian the word cannot derive from Arabic nod 'union, association, meeting'. This assertion may be corroborated also by the now unproductive affix -e(r) in the Laz form. However, an Old Semitic source of the word is quite admissible (cf.Penrixi-Sar^velaje 1990:236). The similar Svan nad(w), ned, nad r and nod r seem to be borrowed from Georgian and Zan forms respectively. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 104). Laz:Schmidt (1962: 127).
GZ *na-wal- 'gone, done; covered; beaten': Georg, naval- 'gone; covered; beaten'; Laz novel- 'trace, trail; footstep'. Apparently a Georgian-Zan formation. It is a past participle based on the verb stem *wal-: wl- and contains the word-formation affix na-.The Zan vocalism can be explained as caused by umlaut. | | Gamqreli3e-Macavariani (1965: 167, 337).
GZ *nat- : nt- 'to shine, give light': Georg, nat- : nt- 'to shine, give light'; Megr. [no/-]; Laz [not-]. A verb stem which is also registered in Old Georgian texts (theaction noun nateba-, natoba-). Cf. modern Georgian a-nat-ebs 'lights up,
136



*nat-e
illuminates' alongside a-nt-ia '(it) shines, gives light'. In the Zan languages the stem can be extracted now only from a derivative noun note- 'splinder, torch' (see *nat-e-).
GZ *nat-e- 'light': Georg, natel- 'light, bright'; Megr. note- 'splinter, torch'; Laz note-. Deverbative formation. It is a derivative of the verb stem *nat- : nt-. In Old Georgian the word functioned as both adjective and substantive: cf. its meaning 'light, ray' (Abulaje 1973: 318). The lexeme's original substantive character is proven by the final vowel in Zan. Topuria interprets the structure of the word in a different way, decomposing it into a prefix *na- and a stem te- 'light' (cf. Topuria 1979: 70). 1 1 Schmidt (1962: 113).
GZ *na-kwet- 'piece, cut, section; lump': Georg, nakvet- 'piece; lump'; Megr. nokvet-.
The word is attested in Old Georgian in the shape of na-kuet(Abulase 1973: 320). By its origin it is a past participle with a prefix *nabased on the verb stem *kwet- : kwt-. The vocalism e of the Zan form derives from umlauted a. | | Rogava (cf. IKE XII, 1960: 166).
GZ *na-kwerc!X-al- 'splinter, fragment': Georg, nakvercxal- 'spark'; Megr. nakvacxir- 'charred log'; Laz nokancxule-. It is a derived with circumfix *na al- from the verb stem (see *kwercix- 'to break to pieces, to smash, to split up'). In Old Georgian it is recorded in the forms nakuercxal- and nakuercxal- (cf. Abula3e 1973: 320). In the Megrelian form the Zan no- is contaminated with Georgian na-, which entered the language with a number of Georgian borrowings. The Laz form has lost its w. The suffixal part of the word needs clarification. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraya (1912: 28). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 159).
GZ *nana- 'mummy': Georg, nana- 'lullaby'; Megr. nana- 'mummy'; Laz nana— 'mother'. A lexeme manifesting a typical sound-symbolic stem ("nursery word"), a common form of address of mother to child and vice-versa. Variants of this form are present in lullabies (cf. Georg, nanina, Laz ηαηί). The interlanguage identity of the words is caused by their sound-symbolic
137



*na—perck
nature. Similar stems are widely known in the Caucasian area (cf. Abx. α-nan, Chechen nana 'mother'), and beyond its boundaries (cf. PIE *nana—, nena— 'mother, nurse'). | | ESKJa: 146.
GZ *na-perck- 'splinter, chip; spark': Georg, na-perck-al- 'spark'; Laz no-pinck-al-e 'splinter; spark'. Deverbative formation. By origin it is a past participle with the prefix na- based on the verb stem *perck- : prck-. In Old Georgian it occurs in the form na-bercq-al- 'spark, lightning' (Abula;je 1973: 316), which is likely to have been contaminated with the verb brcqinva 'to shine'. The uniform suffix -al needs explanation. 1 1 Deeters (1926: 82).
GZ *na—rg— 'planted': Georg, narg— 'planted'; Megr. norg— 'seedling, sapling'. Apparently a Georgian-Zan formation. It is a past participle with the prefix *na- based on the verb stem *rg- 'to plant'. The word reflects a level of agriculture achieved still at the Common Kartvelian age. | | ESKJa: 146.
GZ *na-tex- 'broken; fragment(s)': Georg, natex- 'splinter, fragment(s)'; Megr. notex-; Laz notex-. Deverbative formation. It is a past participle with the *na~ prefix based on the verb stem *tex— 'to break'. The word is known in Old Georgian: ravdeni kueli savsej natexisaj ayiyet"? 'how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?' Mk. 8.19. Cf. also Abulase (1973: 322). In the second syllable of the Zan form the expected a is replaced by e under the umlaut effect of the nominative ending. 1 1 Rogava (cf. IKE XII, 1960: 166).
GZ *na-car- 'powder': Georg, nacar- 'ashes'; Megr. nocer- 'bran'. Probably a Georgian-Zan formation. The word is also attested in Old Georgian texts: nacarsa zeda msxdomareta seinanes... 'they had ... repented, sitting in ... ashes' Lk. 10.13. Cf. also Abulaje (1973: 324). Formally it is a past participle with the *na- prefix based on the verb stem *car- : cr- 'to pour out'. The o vocalism is original for the Megrelian form. The deviation of the words in meaning does not rule out their later independent origin. | | Rogava (cf. IKE XII, 1960: 165-166).
138



CK *nagw- 'spruce, fir(-tree)': Georg. na$v- 'spruce, fir(-tree)'; Megr. nugu—, nuzu-; Svan nezw-ra 'spruce, pinetree (female)'. Attested in Old Georgian with the meaning 'spruce, cypress' (Abulaje 1973: 324), where it had also a derivative na$ovan- 'fir-grove'. The lexeme has been lost in Laz. The Svan form ends in the affix -ra, characteristic of names of plants and trees. For the regularity of the Zan vocalism cf. *payw- Outgrowth, protuberance'. Marr saw in the Svan cognate traces of the Kartv. *ne-zw- 'female'. If the word is an Iranism (cf. Andronikasvili 1946: 389; Bielmeier 1994: 443; Gamkrelidze-Ivanov 1995: 545-546), it must be very old. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Rogava (cf. IKE XII, 1960: 163). Svan: Gigineisvili (1984: 35).
GZ *na-c1qwed- 'scrap, lump': Georg, nacqvet- 'scrap, lump'; Megr. nocqved—.
A deverbative formation attested in Old Georgian. Formally it is a past participle derived from the verb *c\qwed-: c^qwd- 'to break; to tear'. The Georgian and Megrelian forms correspond phonetically to each other. The e vocalism of the Megrelian cognate is due to umlaut (cf. also the usual preservation of the ancient we sequence in Zan penultima). | | Gamqrelige-Macavariani (1965: 162).
GZ *na-q§ir- 'coal': Georg, naxsir-, nasxir- 'coal; Megr. nosker-, noskver-, Laz noske(r)-.
In Old Georgian it is represented by naqsir-, naqsir- (Abulage 1973: 326). Cf. also Xevs. naqsir-. The lexeme appears to be a former past participle with the prefix *na- derived from an unidentified verb stem (cf. *swer- : swr- 'to put out, extinguish'). There is no connection with Svan six- 'coal' (see *c\xe-).
\ | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 76). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 160).
GZ *na-£er- 'piece, portion, cut, section, lump': Georg, nacer- 'lump'; Megr. nocker-.
Apparently a Georgian-Zan formation. In Old Georgian texts it seems to be unattested. It is a derivative with the prefix *na- from the verb stem *cer- : cr- 'to cut'. The e vocalism of the Megrelian word apparently presupposes an o > ö > e development. | | Rogava (cf. IKE XII, 1960: 166).
139



*ne
CK *ne- word-forming prefix: Georg, [ne-]; Megr. [na-]; Laz [na—]; Svan [ne—, nä—].
Word-forming element. In its function this now unproductive prefix shows similarity to *na-, which derives deverbative noun formations. 1 1 USKJa: 146.
CK(?) *neb- 'palm': Georg, neb- 'palm'; Svan [neb-]. Probably a Common Kartvelian protoform. Its Georgian continuant is well attested in Old Georgian texts (dadva nebi twisi... 'he laid his palm...' Keimena, I, 139.15). Cf. also (Abulase 1973: 326). In Svan the stem is found in the lexicalized form nebär 'gloves', where -or must be interpreted as a plural affix. | | Gelernte (1974: 74).
GZ *nedl- 'damp, moist, fresh': Georg, nedl- 'damp, moist, fresh'; Megr. ladir-, ladsr-; Laz ladre-, larde-.
The lexeme is well known from Old Georgian texts (nedl ars igi mzisagan... 'He is green before the sun...' Job 8.16). It is not quite clear whether it contains the prefix *ne- or not (the unbound verb stem *dlhas not been attested). Old / is regularly reflected in all languages. The Laz word may show metathesis of consonants. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 109). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 244).
CK *ne-zw- 'female of small livestock': Georg, nezv- 'female of small livestock'; Svan nezw. The term is known from Old Georgian in the form of nezw- (da qoveli txaj nezwi creli... 'and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted...' Gen. 30.35). It is a derivative with the prefix *ne- based on the verb stem *zw- 'to calve, to kitten'. || Wardrop (1911:619).
GZ *ne-ker£xa- 'maple': Georg, nekercxal- 'maple'; Megr. lakincxa-. Word-formation structure allows us suspect some connection with *krcxa- 'branchy knot'. For the correspondence between Georg, n and Zan / in word-initial position cf. *nedl—, *nems{-, *ne—rciqw—. The final / of the Georgian form must be secondary (this is shown typical of the Georgian-Zan substantives finals). 1 1 Klimov (1988: 20).
140



*nek(u>
GZ *nek(u)- 'little finger': Georg, nek- 'little finger'; Megr. naku-. Its continuant is attested in Old Georgian texts (Abulase 1973: 327). Cf. also Georg. (Xevs.) nikora titi 'little finger'. For the final u of Megrelian form see *kutx(u)-, *ret(u}-, *kec(u)-, *yom(u)-. In Laz the lexeme seems to be lost. | | Klimov (1985: 172).
GZ *nems!- 'needle': Georg, nems- 'needle'; Megr. le(p)s-, li(p)s-; Laz lems-.
The word is attested also in Old Georgian (...gansvlad qurelisa nemsisasa... '...to go through the eye of a needle...' Mt. 19.24). In modern Georgian dialects it has many variants: nevs-, lems-, leps(a)-, nepsa- (cf. yionti 1984: 329). If in the word-initial position we have the historical prefix *ne— the Zan / must be secondary. The identity of e vocalism in all the languages remains obscure. It is difficult to agree with Bouda's assertion (1950: 300) that the word is borrowed from an IndoEuropean source (cf. PIE *siu 'to sew'). Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 33). Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 43).
CK *nena- 'tongue, word': Georg, ena- 'tongue'; Megr. nina-; Laz nena- 'tongue, word'; Svan nin, nsn 'tongue'. Widely represented in Old Georgian texts (enata axalta itqodian 'they shall speak with new tongues' Mk. 16.17). The word-initial n seems to be lost in Georgian. The end of the word is regularly reflected in the languages. The lexeme has a symbolic character (cf. Vogt 1954: 544-545), whence follows its proximity to similar formations in different languages (Sumerian ema, Aztec nsna, Arawakan nene-, etc.) and the identity of β in Georgian and Laz forms. The meaning 'word' is sometimes preserved in Megrelian poetry. A different analysis of the stem is given in Cikobava (1938: 53). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Rosen (1845: 30). Svan: Gren (1890: 140). Cf. also Wardrop (1911: 630) and Marr (1914: 81).
GZ *ne-rg- 'planted, seedling': Georg, nerg- 'sapling, seedling'; Megr. narg- 'planted'. The lexeme is well attested in Old Georgian, where it had the derivatives nergva- 'to plant' and nergovan— 'thick wood' (Abulase 1973: 327). Formed with the prefix *ne- from the verb stem *rg-. Laz nergwith the same meaning must be treated as a loanword from Georgian. Cf. also *na—rg—. 1 1 USKJa: 147.

*ne—rc,qw
CK *ne-rciqw- 'saliva, spittle': Georg, nercqv- 'saliva, spittle'; Megr. lercqva- 'saliva'; Laz lenckva-, lemc(k)va-, lemskva-, lem$kva-\ Svan näsqw, näsxw 'spittle'.
The word is attested in Old Georgian texts (sekmna tiqaj nercqwisagan '(he) made clay of the spittle' Jn. 9.6). It is a derivative with the prefix *ne- from the verb stem *rc^qw- 'to puke, to vomit'. The Georgian and Svan material points to the primacy of the initial n in relation to /. The stem shows the intra-Zan correspondence between Megr. r and Laz n (cf. *burdya-, *gr$-el-, *warcx-wn-, etc.). The Svan word underwent a regular spirantization c >s. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 314). The rest of thematerial can be found in Topuria (cf. IKE XII: 154; 1979: 67).
CK *ne-stw- 'nostril': Georg, nesto- 'nostril'; Svan [nest-]. The word is widely attested in Old Georgian where it meant 'slit, pipe' and had several derivatives (Abula3e 1973: 327-328). It must be analyzed as derived with the prefix *ne— from the verb stem *stw- 'to pipe, to whistle'. The Svan equivalent can be discerned in the form nestral 'nostrils'. However, its hissing s needs explanation. | | Schmidt (1962: 128).
CK *ni- word-forming prefix: Georg. [TM-]; Megr. [TM-]; Laz [TM-]; Svan
[TM-]·
Derivatory element. Presently its productivity has been lost. It can be discerned in the forms *ni—kap— and *ni-(s)kri-. The possibility that it historically had a complex structure cannot be ruled out (cf. *na- and *ne-).
| | Cf. Topuria (1979: 70-72).
CK *ni-kap- 'chin': Georg, nikap- 'chin'; Svan (Lasx.) nikpa. In Old Georgian its continuant occurs in the slightly deviating form nikap- (Abulage 1973: 329). The word must be analyzed as derived with prefix *TM- from the onomatopoeic verb stem *kap- : kp- 'to chatter'. In the Zan languages the lexeme is likely to have been lost (it may have been contaminated with the continuants of *ni-kel- 'snout'). For Svan cf. also nipka (Upp. Bal) and nebka (L. Bal). | | Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 294).
GZ *nikel- 'snout': Georg, nikel- 'snout, lip'; Megr. niku-, nuku-, 'chin'; Laz nu(n)ku-, numku- 'mouth, beak, chin'.
142



*ninw-el
Occurs in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 329). Inter-language phonetic correspondences are maintained. It may contain the historical wordformation prefix *m'-. In the Zan languages the word is likely to have been contaminated with the reflex of*ni—kap— 'chin', as evidenced by the meaning. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 279). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 49-50).
GZ *ninw-el- 'boy, lad, adolescent': Georg, ninvel- 'boy, lad, adolescent'; Megr. [ninu-]. The Georgian lexeme is preserved in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani. The Megrelian form seems to survive in the family name Ninua, extended by the secondary word-forming affix -a. For the regular correspondence between the forms cf. *kartw—el—. 1 1 Sardzweladze (1991: 142-143).
CK *ni-<s)krt- 'beak': Georg. ni(s)kart- 'beak'; Svan nikrat, nikrät.
Attested in Old Georgian in the form of nikart- (Sar|vela3e 1995: 164). It is a combination of the prefix *ni— with the verb stem *(s)kert— : (s)krt- 'to peck'. The contrast between Georg, ar and Svan ra seems to be the result of different vocalization of the former sonant r. In the Zan languages no certain cognate is found. || Wardrop (1911:594).
GZ(?) *nisl- 'mist, fog': Georg, nisi- 'mist, fog'; Megr. nirs-, nars-{?). Well attested in Old Georgian: yrubeli da nisli...'clouds and fog...' (cf. Abula3e 1973: 329). The reflexes of the prototype in both languages are regular, although in the case of borrowing the Megrelian word would show the same kind of metathesis. 1 1 Caraia (1895 XII: 115).
GZ *niiw- 'snout, mug, lip': Georg, nicv- 'snout, mug, lip'; Megr. [nickv-] 'ugly face, mug, snout'. Georgian-Zan archetype. Its continuant in Old Georgian is represented by the complex form nicur- 'the nose of an animal, trunk' (Abula3e 1973: 330). Whereas in the Zan languages the word seems to be lost, its regular correspondence is available in the Georgian (Imer., Lecx.) Zanism nickv- (cf. yionti 1984: 422). The alternative comparison of the Georgian
143



*noya
form with Megr. ni(n)$gv- 'beak' leads to the assumption that two words are to be derived from *ni$w-. | | Sardschweladse (1985: 24). Cf. also USKJa: 148.
GZ *noya- 'lowland': Georg, noqa- 'bog, marsh, swamp'; Megr. ηογα-, ηογο- 'low place, (river)-bed'; Laz ηογα- 'lowland, bank'. Cf. the Georgian derivative noqier- 'fertile' available also in Old Georgian. The West-Georgian form ηογα- (cf. ylonti 1984: 423) seems to be a Zanism. For the correspondence Georg, q ~ Zan and Svan γ cf. *d(l)aqw-, *qoqo-. Word-final a is regular.
CK *nu 'no, not'(prohibitive particle): Georg, nu 'no, not' (prohibitive particle); Megr. nu; Svan [no], Its continuant is well known in Old Georgian (nu iparav, nu cilsa hscameb...\ 'Do not steal, do not bear false witness...!' Mk. 10.19). In Svan it can be extracted from the compound particle with the same meaning (see *numa). For the correspondence between Georgian-Zan u and Svan ο see *tute-, *qur-, *subl-.
1 1 Georgian, Svan Sara3eni3e (IKE 1, 1946: 323-324). Megrelian: Schmidt (1962: 128). Cf. USKJa: 148-149.
CK *numa 'no, not' (the prohibitive particle) : Megr. numu, nsms 'no, not (prohibitive particle)'; Svan norna, norn-. Prohibitive particle. Although its first component seems to be evident (see *nu), its structure needs explanation. While in Georgian and Laz languages the form does not occur at all, in Megrelian it has a restricted use. | | Klimov (1973: 363).
CK *jor- 'two': Georg, or-, vor- 'two'; Megr. zir-, zar-; Laz zu(r)-, $u(r)-, jur-; Svan yon, jori,jerbi.
The numeral is amply represented in Old Georgian (orita perqita 'with two feet' Mk. 9.45). In word-initial position j is reflected regularly. The transition z > j occurs in Laz also in other cases. The Georgian and Svan correspondences preserve the original vocalism. The identical final r in the
144



*oboba
attributively used forms is also regular. The final i of the Svan form may be a reinterpreted former ending of the nominative (cf. *sam- 'three'). Svan jerbi reflects a secondary effect of umlaut: *jori >jewri >jerwi >jerbi. According to Acaryan (1977: 114) the designation of the second month of an old Arm. calendar hori comes back to a Georgian source. Cf. also *sam'three'. | | Rosen (1845: 11), Bopp (1847: 32-33).
CK(?) *oboba- 'spider': Georg, oboba- 'spider'; Megr. [bo(r)bo-\; Laz \bobo-}; Svan opopa, wopopä, op(l)opäj (?).
The assignment of the lexeme to a chronological level remains uncertain. Irregular consonant correspondences and the vocalism point to a descriptive origin of the word. The reconstructed form is therefore merely an approximation. In Zan languages the stem can be extracted from its derivatives: Megr. bo(r)bolia- with the diminutive affix -ia, Laz boboncva-. Cf. also Georgian (Ajar.) Zanisms bobo-cvav-, bobo-cxika'spider'. Svan wobobua- and bobola- seem to be loanwords.
CK *ode 'hardly, just; while': Georg, [ode] 'hardly, just'; Megr. onde 'hardly, slightly'; Svan \vode 'hardly, while'. Apparently a Common Kartvelian adverb. Its continuant is well attested in Old Georgian (amas zraxvida oden... 'while he thought on these things...' Mt. 1.20; cf. Old Georgian ode-s 'when', es-oden 'so much', etc.). It is preserved also in the Georgian particle -ode: oriode Only two', samiode Only three', etc. Cf. Megr. onde-t 'faintly, feebly'. 1 1 USKJa: 150.
CK *otxo- 'four': Georg, otx- 'four'; Megr. otx-; Laz otxo-, ontxo-, otxu—, Svan wostx(w), wosdxvv.
The numeral is amply attested in Old Georgian (ganiqves otxad nacilad... '(they) divided into four parts...' Jn. 19.23; cf. otx-meoc'eighty' and other derivatives). The form illustrates the correspondence Georg.-Zan t ~ Svan st. The Laz and Svan cognates as well as Georgian (dial.) otxo- 'four knucklebones (kind of play)' allow the reconstruction of word-final o. Like in other cases in Svan word-initial results in wo:
145



*om
cf. *oboba-, *ode, *opl-, *oqar-. The numeral is a very early IndoEuropean loanword: cf. PIE *okto(u) 'eight', where -ou marks a dual(cf. Klimov 1994: 472^78). 1 1 Rosen (1845: 11), Bopp (1847: 37).
GZ *om- 'to wage war': Georg, om- 'war'; Megr. Urn- 'to wagewar; choppiness, surf'. Presumably a Georgian-Zan verb stem. In Old Georgian it is attested in the shape of horn-: cf. me-hom-e 'warrior, soldier; rival' (Abulaje 1973: 237, 576). The Megrelian equivalent has developed a secondary / to avoid a vocalic onset; its action noun is lima- 'war' (cf.*ipxl-, *ube-//a-). For the correspondence Georg, o ~ Megr. i see *c,o/-. The origin of the lexeme remains unknown. Possibly an old loanword.
GZ *o(m)pe- 'navel': Georg, upe- 'navel'; Megr. ompa- 'upper log of roof; Laz ompa-, umpa- 'navel'. The word is widely used in Old Georgian texts: aymoavsebad upesa da mucelsa... 'to fill navel and body...' Sin. mr. 110.18. In modern Georgian it has almost been displaced: cf. upe- 'hollow of the eye'. The change ο > u is due to the following labial. The shift e > a in word-final position may point to the possibility of an adjectival use of the lexeme. The Megrelian cognate deviates semantically. The word may have a symbolic origin. Cf. PIE *ombh- : embh- 'navel' (Pokorny 1959: 314), Proto-Hokan unap-, ump- (Sapir 1925: 407). 1 1 Georgian, Laz:Cikobava (1938: 69). Megrelian: USKJa: 186.
CK *opl— 'sweat': Georg, opl— 'sweat, perspiration'; Megr. up(u)—, Laz up-; Svan wep, wop.
The lexeme is well known from Old Georgian texts: da mohqocdes oplsa... 'and they wiped off sweat...' Keimena I 152.29. Word-initial ο became u in Zan form before a subsequent labial. Not unusual is also the correspondence of final Georg. / ~ Zan u (cf. *burtql-, *cqintl-). The Svan sequence we presupposes intermediate step o. | | Rosen (1845: 31).
GZ *opop- 'hoopoe': Georg, opopa- 'hoopoe'; Megr. opop-; Laz opampe-.
Attested in Old Georgian: da opopi da myami... 'hoopoe and noctule...' Lev.11.19. For Megrelian cf. also a diminutive form opopia-. The Svan variants opopa, opop repeat the modern Georgian form with the
146



*oc,
later suffixal —aand therefore must be viewed as loanwords. In spite of its possible onomatopoeic origin, deviating from a specific "areal norm" characteristic for designations of this bird in the Caucasus, more likely is dependence of the word on an ancient Indo-European source: cf. PIE *opop— II epop— alongside Lat. upupa—, Lit. puppukis, Latv. puputis, Arm. hopop 'hoopoe' (Pokorny 1959: 325: Cikobava 1938: 105). However, the Armenian lexeme cannot be (except for Ing. hopop) a direct antecedent on phonetical grounds. Cf. Deeters (1926-1927: 61), Klimov (1994: 129-130). 1 1 Cikobava (see above).
GZ *oc!~ 'twenty': Georg, oc-, voc- 'twenty'; Megr. ec-; Laz ec-. The reflex of the numeral occurs in Old Georgian: vacni ocni... 'twenty he-goats...' Ex. 32.14. e of the Zan equivalents derives from ο through intermediate we. A Megrelian form oc- still survived in 1849. See Brosset (1849: 73). For the history of the vocalism see also Cikobava (1938: 219). A connection of the Georgian-Zan numeral with Svan jer(w)est 'twenty' (cf. Bopp 1847: 40) is excluded, since the latter is a compound based on the combination 'two' + 'ten'. | | Rosen (1845: 11).
CK(?) *oqar- 'solitary, lone (person)': Georg, oxer- 'neglected, nasty,
rotten'; Svan (w)oqar, wiqar Orphan'. A rather problematic equation. The form oqer- in its meaning 'childless, uninhabited, devastated' occurs in Old Georgian (saxli tkueni oqeri... 'your house is left...' Mt. 23.38), where a number of its derivatives are also known (cf. Abulase 1973: 336). Cf. Georgian epithet of an orphan oxer-tial-. Svan w is due to a secondary development. If the comparison holds, the protoform must have been a substantive. Its origin
remains unknown.
\\£SKJa: 151-152.
GZ *papa- 'grandfather': Georg, papa- 'grandfather'; Megr. papu'great grandfather'; Lazpapu(l)- 'grandfather'. The kinship term is attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abulaje 1973: 337). In Georgian this stem is somehow connected with cina-par- 'forefather',
147



*payw
where cina- means 'fore-, pre-'. The identity of the vocalism of the first syllable through the languages points to the symbolic character of the stem (cf. PIE *pap(p)a-). The vowel u in the Zan words proves the age of the stem-final / (in substantives the vowel at the absolute end of a word remained unchanged). In Zan the expected ο becomes u next to a labial. The meaning of the Megrelian equivalent is shifted. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 287), Laz: Cikobava (1938: 14-15), Schmidt (1962: 94). '
GZ *payw- Outgrowth, protuberance': Georg, ραγν- 'belly, paunch'; Megr. puyu—, puxu— 'hump(back)'. Apparently a Georgian-Zan lexeme. The semantic deviation of its continuants can be easily explained by the suggested proto-meaning. There exists also a widespread Megrelian variant of the word puxurua. In Laz the stem seems to be lost. 1 1 Klimov (1985: 172-173).
GZ *pew- 'to find, to discover': Georg, pov- 'to find, to acquire'; Megr. pal-.
Verb stem. In thepo(v)- form its continuant is attested in Old Georgian texts (Abulase 1973: 342). For the correspondence in vocalism and correlation v ~ / between the Georgian and Zan stems (cf. the Megrelian action novuipalua-) see *tew- 'to leave' and *xwew- 'to embrace, wind (round)'. 1 1 Kipsidze (1914: 296). Cf. Klimov (1973: 363-364).
CK *pent— : pnt— 'to scutch (wool)': Georg, pent— 'to scutch (wool, flax, cotton)'; Megr. pint-; Svan pent-.
A term reflecting a typical livestock-raising economy. Although in the Old Georgian texts the verb does not occur it is present in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani. The action nouns are Georgian pentva—, Megrelian pintua-, Svan li-pent-e. Megrelian has derivatives pint- (diminutive pintia-) 'rag, duster, piece of cloth' and pintu-pantu- 'muddle-headed'. However, the Svanpinti 'rag' must be considered a Zan loanword. | | Klimov (1988: 20).
CK *per- 'lather': Georg. per- 'lather'; Megr.pang- 'poison'; Svan per 'lather'. A lexeme, which is also well known from Old Georgian, where it had parallel variants pero— and perul— (cf. romelni perad aymopkureven...
148



*per
'which pour out lather...' Kat. ep. 037.15). Both Zan forms regularly reflect the archetype. The rarely used Megrelian cognate shows change of meaning. It is found in folklore texts (cf. Samusia 1971: 76.695) and in the formula pan^i skan pis\ 'poison into your mouth!'). The Laz equivalent has been preserved in the compound ζογα-ρα$- 'pumice(-stone)', literally 'sea foam' (for the semantics cf. Lat. spuma 'foam' and pumex *pumice(-stone)'). 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 299). Zan: USKJa: 152, Klimov (1988: 157).
CK *per- 'to fly': Georg, [per-} 'to fly'; Megr. [par-]; Svan per-.
• · ··
Verb stem. In Georgian and Zan it can now be found in reduplications. Cf. Georg, pepela- 'butterfly' (< *perpel-) and Megr. parpalua— 'to move quickly'. In Svan the stem is present in its unbound form: action noun li-per 'to fly' (cf. per-n-i 'he flies', ne-pr- 'bird'). The stem has a tangible onomatopoeic character. Cf. PIE *per- 'to fly' (Pokorny 1959: 817) and similar forms in many other languages. 1 1 £SKJa: 152.
CK *perper- 'butterfly': Georg.pepel-a- 'butterfly'; Megr.parpalfta)-, papralia-; Laz parpal-, Svan pepel, p rpold, p rp nd.
Possibly dates from the Common Kartvelian stage. The word is formed by reduplicating the verb stem *per— 'to fly'. It occurs in Old Georgian (pepeli igi okrojsaj 'a gold butterfly' Lev. 8.9). The final a of the Georgian form is a recent evaluation affix. The same must be said on the word-final -ia of the Megrelian cognate. The unusual replacement of ρ by p in Zan may be ascribed to the onomatopoeic character of the verb stem. Analogies of the latter are available also in the Svan forms. | | Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 295), Wardrop (1911: 597). Cf. also USKJa: 153.
GZ *pertq- : prtq- 'to beat out, knock out': Georg, [prtq-] 'to beat out, knock out'*; Megr. \birtq-]. Verbal stem with a variant *bertq—. In its unbound state it does not appear in the Kartvelian languages. The word-forming element -el derives the adjective *prtq-el- 'flat, beaten out'. Does Common Kartvelian *tqirb- 'spleen' have a relation to this stem? 1 1 Klimov (1988: 158).
149



*perck- : prck
CK *perck- : prck- 'to crack, split': Georg, pck-en- 'to chip off, split'; Lazpinck-; Svan peck- : pck- 'to crack'.
Verb stem represented in Old Georgian texts by the form na-bercq-al'spark, flash, lightning'. Cf. modern Georgian action noun pckena-. In Laz it can be identified in the action noun o-pinck-u and in such lexemes as pinckil- 'particle\pencka- 'splinter', no-pinck-al-e 'splinter, spark'. Cf. also the Svan action noun li-peck 'to crack, chap (a little)', li-pck-e II li-bcq-e 'to crack, chap' (trans.) and their nominal derivative pick II picq 'crumb'. The onomatopoeic character of the stem is rather felt here (cf. Kab., Adyg. pceskw- 'to pinch, to tweak [each other]'). Cf. also its Georgian-Zan derivative *na-perck- 'splinter, chip'. | | Nadareisvili (1974: 147)'.
GZ *ρβέ— 'to blink, wink': Georg, [pec] 'to blink, wink'; Megr.pack(y}-. Apparently a Georgian-Zan verb stem. In Georgian it can be found in the sound-symbolic formation pac-un- 'to blink, wink', which presupposes the existence of an original neutral stem pec- (cf. brag-un- 'crash, din' alongside breg- 'to knock, strike', tax-un- 'beating, smashing' alongside tex- 'to beat, strike', etc.). The Megrelian action nounpackualwith the suffix -al naturally corresponds to the Georgian stem.
GZ *pilen31- 'copper': Georg. spilen$- 'copper'; Megr. lin$-, lan^-. The lexeme is found in Old Georgian mainly without later word-initial s (pilen^i... ganubnia '(he) scattered...copper' Jn. 2.15). The same form we find in the Jav. dialect. In Laz it is absent. Word-initial p of the consonant cluster is lost in Megrelian. It forms a typical isogloss uniting Georgian and Zan (Svan spilen^ and speleng are later borrowings). Since the cognates are in phonetical agreement they cannot - pace Acaryan (1979: 84)- go back to Arm. pHnc 'copper'. Together with the latter and isolated Arab./z/zz (< *piliz) 'metal' the word apparently derives from an old cross-cultural term: cf. PIE extended formation *(s)plend- 'to shine, to sparkle, glitter'. Cf. Klimov (1994: 130-134). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 48).
CK *pir- 'edge': Georg.pir- 'mouth, face, edge'; Megr.pig-; Lazpi$-;
• · ··
Svanpil, bil 'edge, lip'.
A lexeme well known from Old Georgian (moartues pirsa missa '(they) put it to his mouth' Jn. 19.29; hence a number of derivatives: pirspir Opposite', pir-mso- 'first-born', etc.) In Svan the word-final /
150



*pir
derives from r. In the Lasx. dialect of Svan p has resulted in b. The specific semantic feature of the Svan lexeme is its connotation 'lip'. | | Georgian, Zan: Rosen (1845: 30). Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 295). Cf. also Marr (1909: 071) and Abaev (1958: 278).
GZ *pir- 'to sharpen (scythe)': Georg, pir- 'to sharpen (scythe)'; Megr. pir-.'
Verb stem. It is a denominative formation from *pir- 'edge'. In the verb stem old r has been regularly preserved. It is a typical Georgian-Zan isogloss pertaining to settled farming (cf. *cel- 'scythe').
GZ *prtq-el- 'flat': Georg, prtqel-, brtqel- 'flat'; Megr. birtqa- 'flat (and round)'. Attributive lexeme derived from the verb stem *pertq- : prtq-. In Georgian there are parallel dialectal forms ptqel-, tqrpel-. The wordinitial voiced consonant is secondary (there is also Megrelian derivative la-partq—ia— 'flat'). For the suffixal part cf. *gr$—el— 'long, high', *wrci-el- 'wide', *clit-el- 'red', *qm-el- 'dry', etc. ||Klimov(1988:'l58).
GZ *pruci-in- 'to squelch': Georg.prucun- 'to squelch'; Megr.purcin-,
• · * · .*
burcin— 'to squelch, to wind'. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. The phonetic shape of the Megrelian equivalent underwent some transformations. First, it shows a metathesis of r. Second, word-initial p may undergo dissimilation. The meaning of the Megrelian cognate is somewhat extended. | | Kipsidze (1914: 299).
GZ *prcka- 'fragment, splinter; stone': Georg, prckal-, brckal'fragment, splinter (of bone, wood)'; Megr. cka- 'stone (of fruit)'; Laz mcka- 'spark'. A nominal correlative of the verb stem *perck- : prck- 'to crack, to split'. It remains unclear whether Old Georgian brckal- registered with a deviating meaning (cf. Abula3e 1973: 36-37) belongs here. In the Zan forms the word-initial consonant cluster has been simplified (cf. also Laz (Xopa, Vice) pencka- 'spark'). A semantic shift has taken place in Laz. Among derivatives of the word may be mentioned the noun pckora- 'place around the hearth'. For the connection of the

*pu
Georgian suffixal form with the suffixless Zan one cf. *bark-, *kupx-, *maqw-,etc.
||'Klimov(1985: 173).
CK *pu- 'to chop, hack, cut to pieces': Georg, p- 'to chop, hack, cut to pieces'; Svan [pu-]. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian: ganipo aeri... 'the air has opened wide...' (thefinal instead of the expected -a ending of the third person is due to u at the end of the stem); the action noun ganpeba-, past participle ganpebul- 'chopped' (Abulage 1973: 65).Its Svan equivalent can be extracted from nä-pu, nä-pu 'piece, lump' (literally 'chopped'). In view of the "s-mobile" found in Kartvelian languages (cf. *ni-(s)krt-, *plen^-, *qid-) the relation to Georg, mo-sp-oba-, Megr. spuala- 'to destroy, annihilate' deserves attention. Cf. the similar PIE verb stem *pu: peu- 'to cut', which points to the descriptive nature of the stem. | | &SKJa: 154.
GZ *put- 'whisper, low muttering': Georg, put-un- 'whisper, low muttering'; Megr. put-in- 'whisper, chirp'. In Old Georgian the lexeme seems to be unattested. The descriptive character of the stem is evidenced by the word-formation affixes Georg. -un and Megr. -in. Compare also Georg, but-but- 'muttering' - a reduplicative formation with dissimilation of the word-initial consonant.
GZ *put-wn- 'to pluck (poultry)': Georg. put(n)- 'to pluck (poultry)'; Megr. puton-; Lazpuntol- 'to pluck, tousle'. A verb stem which belongs to a series of stems containing the suffixal element *-wn. In the Zan forms (cf. action noun Megr. putonua-, Laz o-puntol-u) as in other similar cases, the sonant w has become o. In Laz the stem-final n results in /. The meaning is here expanded, cf. toma gopuntoleri 'with tousled hair'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914:299).
GZ *zez- 'to crumple; to thrash': Georg, zez- 'to crumple; to thrash'; Megr. zaz-.
152



*r
Unattested in Old Georgian. Cf. the action noun Georg, zezva-, Megr. zazua-. The verb stem proves the rarity of the spirant z in the Georgian-Zan stage. Cf. also *z{ezi-. 1 1 Kipsidze (1914: 300).
R
CK *r- 'to be': Georg, r- 'to be'; Megr. [r-]; Laz [r-]; Svan r-. Verb stem widely known from Old Georgian texts. Used here with the preverb gan- it had the meaning 'to be saved (from), to escape, to get rid (of)' (ganernet satan^welsa '(ye) escape the damnation of hell' Mt. 23.33; action noun ganroma—). In the Zan languages the stem is preserved only in the derivative stem or- of the same meaning (see *ar- 'to be'). In Svan it is represented by such word-forms es mi-r-i Ί have (that)'. The stem underlies the Georgian-Zan causative base *r-en- : r-in- (cf. Georg. gan-rin-eba- 'to save', Megr. rina- 'to live, exist'). The semantic deviation across the languages makes its age doubtful. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 628). The rest of the material is brought together in Cikobava (1938: 307).
GZ *rabo- 'ditch': Georg, rabo- 'ditch'; Megr. robu— 'ditch, ravine'; Laz ruba—, o(r)uba—.
Agricultural term reflecting settled farming. In Georgian the word has become dialectal (Imer., Okrib.). While the Megrelian form regularly corresponds to the Georgian one, the Laz equivalent appears to have been contaminated with some other stem. Compare the Megr. (g)ino-robu(with preverb (g)i«o-) 'the place abounding in ravines'. The semantic deviation in the Atina dialect of Laz resulting in 'river' is worth noting. An old borrowing is not ruled out (cf. PIE *ghrabho— 'ditch'). | | Megrelian, Laz: Kipsidze (1914: 308). Georgian: Klimov (1988: 158).
CK *ratx- : rtx- 'to stretch out; break, disconnect': Georg, rate- :rtx'to stretch out; break, disconnect'; Megr. (r)tx- 'to stretch, extend'; Laz ntx— 'to stretch; to disconnect'; Svan rtx—. Verb stem. In Georgian it is represented almost exclusively in the language of ancient literature (action noun ganrtxma-), where it showed
153



*ratq- : rtq
ablaut alternation (carmoiratx qeli senil da carmoirtxa... 'stretch forth thine hand! And he stretched it out...' Mk. 3.5). An r II n interchange occurs in the Zan material (cf. *gr$e-l-, *warcxwn-, etc.). In Svan the stem may be extracted from the derivative irtxin //rtxin 'span, inch'. The Georgian-Zan extended base *rtx-am- : rtx-m- is its derivative. | | Georgian, Zan: Oikobava (1938: 283-284). Svan: USKJa: 156.
CK *ratq- : rtq- 'to gird, engird': Georg, ratq- : rtq- 'to gird, engirdle'; Megr. rtq-; Laz tk-; Svan rtq-.
Verb stem amply known in Old Georgian (seartqa mat sartqelebi... 'and girded them with girdles...' Lev. 8.13, where sa-rtqel- is 'girdle'). In Laz the consonant cluster has been simplfied resulting in tk. The Zan (cf. action noun Megr. mo-rtq-apa-, Laz go-tk-u) and Svan (cf. la-rtq 'girdle') correspondences reflect only the zero ablaut grade of the stem. | | Georgian, Svan: Wardrop (1911: 595). Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 323).
GZ *racx— : rex— 'to count, compute, calculate; to expect': Georg, racx'to count, calculate; to consider'; Megr. ko-rocx-; Laz ko-(r)ocx-, ko—recx—.
Verb stem well documented in Old Georgian (da^des da ayiracxos... 'sitteth (no) down first, and counteth...' Lk. 14.28; ayracxil- 'counted, calculated'). In modern Georgian the stem is preserved only in its derivatives, cf. se-u-racx-qopa- 'an insult'. The nominal correlative of the stem ricxv- 'number' is known from Georgian (cf. Old Georgian varskulavt mricxvel- 'astrologer', literally 'calculator of stars'). Word-initial ko- in Zan probably derives from the prefix of the mutual version oko-; a different analysis can be found in Oikobava (1938: 297). In Megrelian the stem is not widely used. Megr. muricx- and Laz murucx- 'star' are likely to belong here as well as some derivatives. The connection of Svan li-cx-e 'to count, suppose' with this stem needs more argumentation. | | Laz, Georgian: Marr (1908: 2). Megrelian: Cikobava (1938: 297).
CK(?) *rg- 'to be fit, be useful': Georg, varg- : rg- 'to be fit, be useful'; Megr. rg-; Laz rg-; Svan rg-.
Possibly a Common Kartvelian verb stem widely known in Old Georgian (aras argebs mas '(he) can prevail nothing' Mt. 27.24), where its derivatives are also represented. Contrary to other languages (cf. the Laz
154



*rg
action noun o-rg-u 'to be fit, to suit', mo-rg-un 'it will suit me', Svan action noun li—rg—ie) in Georgian there is also a form varg— (cf. vargi 'suited'), which evokes some doubts in the Kartvelian origin of the stem: cf. Arm. vark 'prestige, reputation' (see Acafyan 1979: 322). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 304). Laz: USKJa: 81. Svan: Fähnrich (1987: 34).
GZ *rg- 'to plant': Georg, rg- 'to plant'; Megr. rg-; Laz rg-. Verb stem well represented in Old Georgian texts: cf. action noun dargva- (Abula^e 1973: 120). It seems to be a lexicalized zero grade of the base *lag- : Ig-. The sequence Ig, unusual for Kartvelian languages, yields rg. The stem underlies the derivatives *na-rg- and *ne-rg-. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: cf. Topuria (1979: 10). Laz: lavaxisvili (1930: 214).
GZ(?) *-re enclitic particle: Georg, -re; Megr. -le; Laz -le. Probably a Georgian-Zan item. The particle is well known in Old Georgian (cf. go—re Onside, beyond'). In Zan languages it is used nowadays more widely than in Georgian: Megr. go—le 'beyond', me—le On the opposite side', mo-le On this side', cox(o)-le 'in front, ahead', etc. The difference in the consonant element makes this equation tentative.
GZ *regw- 'to throw on, fall upon': Georg, [regv-] 'to throw on, fall upon'; Megr. ragv-; Laz [rag-]. Verb stem. In Georgian it may be extracted from its derivative sa-regv-, sa-regv-av- 'trap' (it is unlikely that Georg, daregva- 'to spoil' belongs here). In Laz the stem is attested by the noun rag- 'trap'. In its verbal state the stem survives only in Megrelian: action noun ragvin-, ragvapa- (here ragv- 'trap' is also available). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Neisser (1958: 45). Cf. Schmidt (1962: 129).
CK *rek- 'to knock, tap, strike': Georg, rek- 'to knock, strike, ring'; Laz \rak-} 'to ring'; Svan rek-, rk-.
A verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (hreked mas... '(the servants) did strike him...' Mk. 14.65). In Laz it may be extracted from the later formation o-rakal-u 'to ring'. Cf. Georgian-Zan derivative *(s)a-rek-el'small bell, bluebell'. The meaning 'to ring' must be secondary. For Svan cf. action noun li-rk-sn-i and ad-rek-aw-e '(he) rung'. | | ASKJa: 155. '
155



*ret(u)
GZ *ret(u)- 'foolish, stupid, silly; fool': Georg, ret- 'foolish, stupid, silly'; Megr. rintu-, rants- 'fool'. Apparently a Georgian-Zan adjective, which is attested in Georgian medieval literature (cf. Rustaveli 269.2). It belongs to the words which have lost (?) their stem-final vowel in Georgian: cf. also *nek(u}-, *kecu-, *yom(u)-. The inserted n in Megrelian causes the shift e > i. In Megrelian subdialects the word has also the meaning 'she-goat'. | | Klimov (1988: 158).
CK *rekw- : rkw- 'to cover': Georg, rkv- 'to cover'; Svan rakw- : rkw-. Verb stem. Its continuant is well represented in Old Georgian: action noun darkuma-, cf. a derivative sa-rkw-el- 'cover, lid (of a vessel)'. In Svan it shows ablaut alternation (action noun li-rkw-ί, cf. li-rekw 'clothes, garments'). The stem characterizes the word-forms of the aoristic series of tenses. 1 1 Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 298).
CK *rekw- : rkw- 'to say': Georg, rkv- 'to say'; Svan rekw-. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian sources: brmaman man hrkua was...'the blind man said unto him...' Mk 10.51. Action noun - rkuma(Abula3e 1973: 350). Contrary to Svan in Georgian the zero grade of ablaut is retained. Cf. Svan r kw 'he said' and le-rekw 'clothes'. ||Topuria(1931:255).
CK *reyw- : ryw- 'to pour, pull down, destroy; fall in, collapse': Georg. ryv- 'to pour, pull down; fall in, collapse'; Megr. (r)yv- 'to pour, throw (oneself)'; Svan reyw- 'to fall down, collapse : ryw- 'to destroy'. Verb stem well known from Old Georgian texts: davarywio talari ese... Ί will destroy this temple...' Mk. 14.58 (action noun ryueva-, mryuie- 'muddy'). In the Megrelian continuant the word-initial r is usually absent (cf. the action noun (r)yvapa—). If the connection with the Laz o-by-u holds the latter form must have been substantially contaminated with some other stem. Its Svan match (action nouns li-reyw and li-ryw-e) preserves the ablaut alternation e (Hi) ~ 0. The similarity of the stem to PIE *re(H)u- 'to tear, break' is worth noting. | | Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Cf. Topuria (1979: 84).
CK *req- : rq- 'to drive (multitude of objects)': Georg, rek- 'to drive, drive out (multitude of objects)'; Megr. ra'-; Svan req- : rq.
156



*req— : rq
Verb stem. In Georgian it seems to be contaminated with *rek-, which resulted in a change q > k. The old q is regularly reduced in Megrelian (action noun ra 'ua-). The stem has developed here a number of secondary meanings. Its original phonetic shape has been preserved in Svan (cf. the action noun li-rq-in-e; läj-req 'he drove (that) home, brought (that) in'). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 27). Svan: Rogava (IKE I, 1946: 4).
CK *req- : rq- 'to oscillate, shake': Georg, rq- 'to oscillate, shake'; Megr. ra'-; Svan req- : rq- (raq-) 'to shake, tremble; to fall, overthrow, topple'. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian: qovelni borcuni irqeodes 'all the hills were swaying' ler. 4.24 (action noun rqeva-). For Megrelian cf. the action noun ge—ra'ua-, go—ra'ua— 'to shake (of the nut trees)'. In Svan the stem retains two grades of ablaut alternation (action noun li-rq-sn-i).
\'\ Georgian, Svan: Deeters. Cf. Schmidt (1962:130).
GZ *re£x- : rdx- 'to purl, babble, murmur': Georg, [recx-]- : cxr- 'to purl, babble, murmur'; Megr. racx-; Svan rex-. Verb stem. Its onomatopoeic character is obvious (cf. the Georgian action noun cxrial- with a typical formative -ial). In Georgian the stem is found side by side with the noun recx— 'pit—a—pat'. The Megrelian action noun is racx-al-. The Svan form reflects only the zero grade of the stem: cf. its action noun li-rcx-9n-e. There exists also a Georgian-Zan derivative *me-rcx-e 'shallow (water), thin; rare'. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Fähnrich (1987:34).
CK *rec,- : re,- 'to spread; make a bed': Georg, rec-'to spread, make a bed'; Megr. re-; Laz (r)c-, Svan ras-: rs-.
Verb stem. Its continuant is attested in Old Georgian (dareca 'he spread it' Sin.mr. 215.18; darecil- 'spread, laid', sarecel- 'bed'). The Zan equivalent reflects zero grade of the stem (cf.the action noun Megr. rcapa-). The Svan forms contain both ablaut grades: cf. the action noun li-rs-i alongside its derivative l9-ras(w) 'laid, spread, made'. For the spirantization of the original affricate in Svan cf. *waci-, *kac\-, *c\en: c\n-, etc.

*rec,x-: r^x
CK *recix- : rciX- 'to wash, launder': Georg, recx- : rex- 'to wash'; Megr. rex- 'to wash'; Laz ex-; Svan rex- 'to rinse'. Common Kartvelian verb stem which occurred in Old Georgian with two grades of the ablout alternation (perqni misni ganrcxna '(he) washed ... the legs' Lev. 8.21; mrcxel- 'washing', action noun ganrecxa-). In Megrelian the action noun is rcxuala-, in Laz o-cx-u (the latter form has lost the initial r). The Svan action noun is li-rcx-ine. The semantic unity of the cognates remains obvious. Cf. the Georgian-Zan derivative *(s)a-rciX-el-.
1 1 Georgian, Laz: Marr (1910: 212). Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 312). Svan: USKJa: 159.
CK *reck- : rick- 'to jingle, tinkle, ring': Georg, [reck-] : rick-; Laz ra(ri)ck-, ranc-; Svan rsk-.
Unattested in Old Georgian. Its modern Georgian derivative rack-unpresupposes an underlying verb stem *reck—. A different grade of ablaut alternation is reflected in rick—in— with the same meaning. For Laz cf. orackonik rackalaps 'bell rings' CT V: 182.312, where o-rack-On- is a noun derivative of the same stem (action noun o—ranck-al—u). Its Svan equivalent is found with a spirant s (action noun li-rsk-sn-e). The stem bears a patently onomatopoeic character, which is indicated by the characteristic Georgian word-forming suffixes -un and -in. \ | Georgian, Svan: Fähnrich (1987: 35).
GZ *rex- 'to beat, strike (with sth.)': Georg, rex- 'to bang, beat, strike (with sth.)'; Megr. rox- 'to bang, beat out'. Verb stem found in Old Georgian texts in the form of action noun rexueba- (Sar^vela^e 1995: 170). The Megrelian stem's vocalism (action noun roxua-, cf. go-b-rox-i struck, beat it out') indicates the former existence of a parallel vocalization with a (cf. *gr—ex-, *gem— : gm—, *clew— : c\w- etc.). Laz rax- (action noun o-raxun-u) with the same meaning seems to be borrowed from Georgian raxun- id.
GZ *rt- 'to join, unite; to become united, whole': Georg, rt- 'to join, unite'; Megr. [rt-]; Laz [rt-].
Verb stem used independently only in Georgian: ac vinaj hrtavs yuar^li? 'from whence then hath it tares?' Mt. 13.27 (action noun sertva-). In Old Georgian there existed rtva- 'to join, unite, add' and dartva- 'to add' (Abula3e 1973: 347). The stem underlies the Georgian
158



*rtw
Zan numeral *e-rt- One' and, apparently, *m-rt-el- 'whole'. Sometimes one is tempted to connect it with *(s)t- 'to spin (with a spindle)'.
GZ *rtw- 'to cover': Georg, rt- 'to cover'; Megr. (r)t(v)- 'to don (hat)'; Laz t(v)-.
Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian: daurton mas zeda samoseli '(they) will put him on the clothes' Num. 4.8; cf. its derivative sartul'roof (Abulaje 1973: 368). In the Zan equivalents the stem-initial resonant is poorly preserved (action noun Megr. (r)tuala—, Laz o—tval—u). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Marr (1913.2: 19). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 279-280).
GZ *rtx-am- : rtx-m- 'to stretch (out); to break, disconnect': Georg. rtxam— : rtxm— 'to stretch (out); to disconnect'; Megr. txim-, txam— 'to stretch, extend'; Laz ntxim- 'to stretch (out); disconnect'. Verb stem widely known from Old Georgian (action noun ganrtxma-, dartxma-). It is a derivative of the simple verbal base *ratx- : rtx-, which was formed by adding the thematic affix (see *-am : -m). The Georgian forms reflect both ablaut grades of the stem, whereas their Zan correspondence (action noun Megr. txsma-, Laz xe go-ntxim-eri 'with outstretched hands') continues only its zero grade. | | £SKJa: 156.
GZ *ris!X- 'to be angry; to swear, to quarrel (with)': Georg, risx- 'to be angry; to swear, quarrel (with)'; Megr. isx- 'to walk (swearing)'. Verb stem attested with its derivatives in Old Georgian: ara serisxnet mas 'don't reprove him' Ruth 2.15 (action noun risxva-). The Megrelian cognate has lost the initial r (for combinatory reasons?): isxäns 'he walks swearing'. Usually the stem occurs with preverbs. ||Rogava(1981:58-60).
GZ(?) *rken- : rkin- 'to fight, wrestle': Georg, rken-, rkin- 'to fight, wrestle'; Megr. rkin-. Possibly a Georgian-Zan verb stem attested in Old Georgian (erkineboda mas... 'there wrestled a man with him...' Gen. 32.34), where it had its derivatives. Georg, rkena- 'wrestle' recorded by S. Orbeliani reflects the historical e vocalism. Action noun Georg, rkineba-, Megr. rkina-, rkinapa-. A dependence of the Megrelian stem on the Georgian source cannot be ruled out.
159



*rkw
CK *rkw- 'to clean, sort out': Georg, rkv- 'to clean, sort out'; Svan rk-. Verb stem, apparently unattested in Old Georgian. The Georgian action noun is rkveva- (cf. ga-rkveva- 'to clear up, reveal'). Its Svan cognate (cf. the action noun li-rk-sn-e) has lost w of the root and added the affixal element. A connection between the stem and Georgian-Zan *kwal- 'track, trace' can hardly be proved. ' 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 34).
GZ *rum- 'to get dark': Georg, rum- 'to get dark, grow dark'; Megr. rum-.
Verb stem. In Old Georgian its continuant may be discerned in the derivatives m-rum-e 'dark' (Abula;je 1973: 295) and mo-m-rum-e'darkish' (Sar^velaje 1995: 136). The identical shape of the stem in Georgian and Megrelian is regular. Cf. the Megrelian action noun rumua(irumu 'it is getting dark'). 1 1 Kipsidze (1914: 310). Cf. also Lomtatise (IKE XI, 1959: 72-73).
CK *rkw-am- : rkw-m- 'to cover, be covered': Georg, rkvam- : rkm'to cover'; Svan (r)kw-em- 'to dress, clothe (oneself)'. Verb stem. Its continuant is found in Old Georgian: action noun darkuma- (Abulase 1973: 121). The stem is derived from the base *rekw: rkw- with the help of the thematic suffix (see *-am : -m). It is used in the word-forms of the presentic series of tenses.
\\Cf.ESKJa: 158.
GZ *r£- 'to listen (to), obey': Georg, re- 'to listen (to), obey'; Megr. rck'to hear, to be heard'. Verb stem well known in Old Georgian texts: ercda Abraham qmasa Sarajsa 'Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah' Gen. 16.2 (action noun morcola-). In Megrelian the stem is extended by the historical affix -i7: cf. action noun rckila-. 1 1 Schmidt (1962: 130).
GZ *rc- 'to shake, swing': Georg, re- 'to shake, swing'; Megr. [re-, we-]; Laz nc- 'to turn over; to move, stir; to touch; to disturb'. Verb stem. The Georgian action noun is rceva, the derivative sa-rceval-a- 'cradle'. The Zan equivalent shows an intra-Zan correspondence r ~ «. In Megrelian the stem may be discerned in the
160



*rcam- : rcm
derivative o-nc-e 'cradle' (see *(s)a-rc-e). The Laz action noun is me-nc-u.
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 291). Laz: ESKJa: 159.
GZ *rcam- : rcm- 'to believe': Georg, ream- : rcm- 'to believe'; Megr. rcum-.
Verb stem widely documented in Old Georgian texts: cf. the action noun rcmena- 'to believe' and rcmuneba- 'to assure, convince, persuade' (Abulaje 1973: 351). The Megrelian equivalent is easily identified in the derivative u-rcum- (> u-rckum-) 'unbelievable, huge; enormously thick, dense'. Cf. also later Megrelian action noun rcumeba- 'to believe (in), assure'. ||Klimov(1985: 173).
CK *rciqaw- : rCjqw- 'to vomit; to throw out, excrete, eject liquid': Georg, rcqav- : rcqv- 'to press out, squeeze out (abscess, boil); to water, irrigate'; Megr. [rcqv-} 'to spit'; Laz nckv-al-\ Svan [sqv-]. Verb stem recorded in Old Georgian texts (yidremde ara moircqos qoveli mcuanvili 'it withereth before any other herb' Job 8.12; cf. the derivatives u-rcqul- 'unwatered', me-rcqul- 'water-carrier'). In Megrelian and Svan it may be discerned only in the derivative *ne-rciqw-. The Laz continuant of the stem is preserved in the form of mck(v)- or nck(v}'to squeeze out (abscess)'; action noun o—mck—u. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 314). Laz, Svan: Topuria (IKE XII, 1960: 154). Cf. ESKJa: 160.
CK *r|w- 'to overcome, conquer': Georg. [r$v-\ 'to overcome, conquer'; Megr. [r^gv-]; Laz [rjgv-]; Svan [rsgw-].
Verb stem. In modern languages as well as in Old Georgian it does not occur in its unbound form and may be extracted only from derivatives (see *mar$we- and *mar$wen-). Compare also *$-.
GZ *sa— interrogative pronominal stem: Georg, [sä—]; Megr. [so-]; Laz [so-].
Pronominal element, which can be discerned through languages in the lexicalized derivative *sa-d 'where'. In Georgian the stem is also present
161



*sa-d
in the Old Georgian particle sa-me 'and really, then, well, somewhere' (Abula5e 1973: 362). \\Cf.£SKJa: 161.
GZ *sa—d 'where': Georg, sad(a) 'where'; Megr. so, sode; Laz so-. Interrogative pronoun. It is amply represented in Old Georgian (sada ars Sara? 'where is Sarah?' Gen. 18.9) and must be treated as a lexicalized form of the adverbial case of the pronominal element *sa-. Cf. the relative adverb Georg, sada-c, Megr. sode-t. In Laz the end of the word is usually reduced. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Bopp (1847: 44—45).
GZ *sal- 'steep': Georg, sal- 'steep, high'; Megr. sol-. Unattested in Old Georgian. Since the vocalic shape of the cognates is regularly differentiated they cannot derive from the Arm. sal 'anvil' as was sometimes believed in the past. Cf. Acaryan (1979: 155—156). | | Fähnrich (1982: 36).
CK *sam— 'three': Georg, sam— 'three'; Megr. sum—; Laz sum—; Svan semi.
The numeral is widely attested in Old Georgian (sam dye da sam yame... 'three days and three nights...' Jonah 2.1, cf. its derivatives sameba- 'trinity, trio', smnier- 'three-year-old steer'). In the Zan lexeme the regular shift o > u takes place adjacent to the labial consonant. The Svan dative case form sam reflects the primary vocalism of the stem which has been changed in the form of the nominative. According to Acaryan (1979: 163) the designation of the third month of an old Armenian calendar sahmi goes back to Georg, sam- 'three'. Cf. also *jor- 'two'.
| | Rosen (1845: 11), Bopp (1847: 36).
GZ *sar- : sr- 'to throw': Georg, sar- : sr- 'to throw, shoot'; Megr. [sir—]; Laz [sir—],
Verb stem registered in Old Georgian texts (esrodes ... urtiertas isrita... '(they) shot arrows at each other...' Sin. mr. 237.16). Its derivative *i—sar— 'arrow' has preserved the characteristic verbal prefix i—. It is precisely through the latter noun that the stem may be historically traced back in the languages of the Zan branch. | | Cf.Topuria (1979: 97), USKJa: 161-162.
162



*sasw
GZ *sa§w- 'thrush (blackbird)': Georg, sasv- 'thrush (blackbird)'; Megr. zeskv-; Laz mzesku-, mzesku-.
In the form sasu- the lexeme is found in Old Georgian (Abulage 1973: 471). The word-initial s was reconstructed by Kipsidze. The consonant m in Laz equivalents is treated as a secondary augmentation. The Zan vocalism is likely to have developed through umlaut *o > ve (cf. *oc}—, *yor-, *3iaryw-). According to Gamkrelidze's law the old /before w gives sk in Zan (Gamqrelije 1959: 27). Cikobava (1938: 105-106) supposed that the stem contains a petrified historical prefix. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 114), Marr (1936: 64). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 105).
GZ *sa|- : s£- 'to judge, try, punish': Georg. sa$- : s$- 'to judge, try, punish'; Megr. zo$- 'to wish, desire'. Verb stem. Its continuant is well known in Old Georgian: .. .gsago sen '.. .will I judge thee' Lk. 19.22; action noun s$a—, derivative s$ul— > r$ul'law, trust'. The Megrelian form (cf. action noun zo$ua-) represents a simplification (with assimilation s > z) of expected regular *so$g-. Apparently this earlier form of the Megrelian stem is found with consonants transposed in the Svan Zanism sgo$- 'to judge, to try'. 1 1 T. Gudava. Cf. ÜSKJa: 162.
GZ *sel— 'flax': Georg, sei— 'flax'; Megr. su-,psu-; Laz [su-]. Well attested in Old Georgian texts (seli da krtili iguema... 'the flax and the barley was smitten...' Ex. 9.31). The correspondence Georg, -el ~ Megr. -u at the end of the noun stem is regular. The initial p in the Megrelian form must be secondary. In Laz the stem is identified in derivatives: cf. o—sul—u 'to chip hemp (for strings)', sule(r)— 'fibre' (in Colchis flax was cultivated as early as the first millennium B.C.; according to Herodotus it was exported from there), lavaxisvili (1930: 372) supposed Svan sal- 'flax' to be inherited, which is hard to agree with because of its final /. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Marr. Laz: Rogava (1962: 99).
CK *sem- : sm- 'to hear, to be heard': Georg, sm- 'to hear, to be heard'; Megr. s/w-; Laz sim-; Svan sm-, sam-. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian, where it has kept also the e grade (qmaj misi gesmis 'you hear its sound' Jn. 3.8; cf. segesemin cemil 'listen to me!'). The Zan cognates reflect the zero grade of the stem. The use of
163



*sen
the Megrelian correspondence is rather restricted: cf. kegjasimu 'it was heard (indistinctly)'. Cf. the Svan action noun li-sim. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 318). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 314). Cf. also USKJa: 164.
CK *sen 'you' (sing.): Megr. si 'you' (sing.); Laz si'(n); Svan si. Pronoun of the 2nd person singular. Already in Old Georgian this stem is replaced by the stem of the possessive pronoun sen- (see *swen-). The end of the Zan forms vestigially preserves the old word-final n. The protoform has been reconstructed in Cikobava (1938: 8-9). Bopp (1847: 411) has compared the Laz si directly with Georg,sen. | | Rosen (1847: 411).
GZ *ser- : sr- 'to slide, slip, glide': Georg, [sr-] 'to slide, slip, glide'; Megr. [sar- : rs-] 'to slide; to turn, spin'; Laz sur-. Verb stem. In Old Georgian it seems to be unattested. In its unbound state the stem occurs only in Laz (action noun o-sur-u). Its zero grade is reflected in the derivative *sr-ial- 'to slide', whereas the full grade is preserved only in the languages of the Zan branch: cf. Megr. sarsal- (< sar-sar-) 'sliding' and sarsalia- 'slippery'. The metathesis sr > rs takes place regularly in Megrelian. Georgian-Zan *sr-es- : sr-s- may be treated as its derivative.
CK *sw- 'to stick in, stab, thrust': Georg, sv- 'to stick in, thrust'; Megr. [ifVy)-] 'to thrust, plunge'; Laz [s(v)-]; Svan sw- 'to stick in'. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian texts: action noun dasoba-, sesoba- (Abulaje 1973:123). Its derivative *s\v-am- : sw-m- is formed with the help of the thematic affix. Georgian sv-et- 'column' derives possibly from it as well. The Svan action noun is li—sw-e. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Fähnrich (1982: 36, 1987: 36).
GZ *sw— 'to pass over; to oil, smear (with)': Georg, sv—'to pass one's hand (over); to smear (with)'; Megr. s(v)-; Laz s(v)-. Verb stern attested in the same form in Old Georgian. The Zan correspondence coincides essentially with the Georgian one:cf. Megr. usvana '(they) smear him'. The final v is absent in the forms with following suffixal u: cf. Megr. komisu 'he smeared (for)me'. For Laz cf. action noun o-s-u. The stem is used in the word-forms of the aoristic series of

It is also available in Old Georgian: cf. action noun suma- (Abulase 1973: 405-406). At present the stem is used independently only in Georgian (action noun sma-} and Svan (action noun li-swern). In Svan also its derivative lu-swem 'nail' is known.
GZ *sw-am- : sw-m- 'to pass (over); to smear': Georg, svam- : sm- 'to pass hand (over); to smear'; Megr. sum-; Laz sum-. Georgian-Zan verbal formation which is also registered in Old Georgian: action noun suma- (Abulase 1973: 406). It is formed from a simple base of the same meaning (see *sw-) with the help of the thematic affix *-am : -m. Two ablaut grades of the stem are preserved only in Georgian. The Zan form (cf. action noun Megr. sumala-, Laz o-sum-u) reflects the historical zero vocalism. The stem is used in word forms of the presentic tenses. Cf. USKJa: 163.
GZ *swe- 'wing, feather': Georg, sve— 'wing'; Megr. sua—,psua- 'wing, feather'; Laz (p)sva-, psua-, mswa-.
For Georgian it is testified in language of Rustaveli (cf. 957.3, 1616.2). At present its continuant survives in the Xevs. and Psav. dialects of Georgian. For the initial p in Zan cf. *sel-. The correlation between the word-final vocalism of the Georgian and Zan lexemes remains unclear, since the substantive function of the word presupposes here an identical vowel. For the rendering of w in Megrelian cf. *arwa-, *kwa-, *m-sw-e-, etc. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 101). Georgian: Lomta^e (1945: 307-312).
GZ *swer- : swr- 'to lay out; to arrange, order; to draw up': Georg. [svr-] 'patch, strip (of cultivated land)'; Megr. svar- 'to march'; Laz (n)svar— 'to form row, column; to arrange'. Verb stem. It does not occur in Old Georgian texts. In modern Georgian it can be extracted from dialectal (Kartl.) svr-e- 'strip (of cultivated land)'. Cf. also the Imer. srv-el- 'ploughed up strip' (yionti 1984: 492).

*stw
These forms reflect zero grade of the stem, while their Zan equivalent (action noun Megr. gile-svar-ua-, Laz. o-(n)svar-u} contains its full grade. In Megrelian the stem occurs infrequently. || Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 311-312). Georgian: Fähnrich (1984: 43).

The verb stem, which may be seen in the Georgian nominal derivative rtvel- 'autumn, gathering (fruits) in harvest', represented in Old Georgian in the form stuel-: action noun stuleba-, ttuej stulisaj October' (cf. Abulase 1973: 388). While in Megrelian no certain cognate is found, Laz has preserved the verbal use of the stem: mustu '(it) broke away, was torn off'. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 313).
CK *sir- 'bird': Georg, sir- 'small bird, sparrow'; Megr. sind- 'duck'; Svan [sir—] 'black grouse (black cock)'. The word is well documented in Old Georgian (anu ara ori siri ertis dangis ganiqidebisl... 'Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?...' Mt. 10.29). The Megrelian form presupposes the regularly expected si$-. Cf. the Svan Zanism cqasin$- 'duck' alongside cqar-sind- in modern Megrelian, where cqar- means 'water'. The native Svan equivalent of the lexeme is attested in Svan mo-sir 'black grouse', where mo- is a wordforming prefix. The assumption of a Greek origin of the word (Rogava 1983: 13-14) is unwarranted. | | Georgian, Zan: USKJa: 163. Svan: Fähnrich (1985: 27).

Verb stem represented in Georgian complex from skv-en— : skv—n—, attested also in Old Georgian (da daaskunes ese esret 'and decided it in this way' Kartl. ex. 4.16; cf. also skul- 'knot'). The cause of the irregular alternation k ~ k in Zan cognates needs an explanation.

166



sm-en- : sm-in
Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. It survives, however, in modern Georgian (Gur., Imer.) dialects (yionti 1984: 273). Whereas the Georgian forms reflect both ablaut grades, the Megrelian continues only zero grade (action noun sirkua-). Similar relations are attested in *gen- : gn-, *deg: dg-, *zard- : zrd-,and in many other instances. In Laz the stem is likely to have been lost. It may have an onomatopoeic origin. Cf. PIE *(s)leigh'to lick' (Pokorny 1959: 669). The affiliation of similar Arm. (dial.) slk'il 'to slip, slide' remains unclear. 164.
CK sm-en- : sm-in- 'to listen (to)': Georg, smen- : smin- 'to listen (to)'; Megr. simin-; Laz simin-, sibin-; Svan smin-.
Verb stem widely represented in Old Georgian texts (smenit ismino qmqj mati 'you will hear their cry' Ex. 22.23; cf. its derivatives smenil'well-known', sasmenel- 'ear'). The stem is formed from the simple base *sem- : sm- by adding the causative affix *-en : -in. For Megrelian cf. ma-simin-apal- 'divulging (person)'. In Laz (cf. vi-simin-i Ί heard') an irregular change m > b may have occurred. For Svan cf. action noun li—smin—e. 1 1 USKJa: 165.
GZ *sr-et- 'to destroy, exterminate': Georg, sret- 'to destroy, exterminate'; Megr. sirot- 'to crush, destroy; to wipe off'. Verb stem containing a historical extension *-ed : -id, which presupposes the existence of a root *sr— (cf. *ser- : sr—). As in several other cases the Megrelian (cf. action noun sirotua-) form shows ο instead of the expected a, which makes possible a reconstruction of the parallel *sr-at(cf. Macavariani 1958: 265 and sqq). In both languages the historical sonant r is reflected regularly. In Laz the stem has been lost. | | Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 295).

In Old Georgian it is identifiable in the derivative srswil'abscess, pimple' (see *srsw-il-). Georgian forms reflect both grades of ablaut alternation, whereas the Zan cognate contains only zero grade. For Megr. -ol (action noun sirsolua—) cf. *c]xikw— , *xut-, and other entries.

of the Svan analogue (action noun li-sras-e), which can be considered a Zan borrowing, remains unclear. | | Georgian, Megrelian: USKJa: 165-166. Svan: Klimov (1985: 173).
GZ *sr-ial- 'sliding, slipping; twisting': Georg, sr-ial- 'sliding, slipping'; Megr. rs-iol- 'twisting; turning, rotation'. Derived from the verb base *ser-: sr- by adding the historical suffix *-ial, which usually occurs in sound-symbolic stems (cf. *z^r-ial-, Georg, gr-ial- 'crash, thunder'; pr-ial- 'brightness, shine', etc.). In the Megrelian form there is the usual metathesis sr > rs. 1 1 Cf. USKJa: 165.
GZ *srsw-il- 'pimple, abscess': Georg, sirsvil- 'pimple, abscess, lichen, herpes'; Megr. sursu- 'pimple, abscess, bump'; Laz msursu-, msirsu-. The lexeme is documented in Old Georgian texts (vitarca srswilman sa$ovari povos 'like lichen (it) will find soil' Krest. 147.88). It derives from the stem *sr-es-: sr-s- by the adding of the past participle affix -il. Cf. also the Georgian dialectal variants sirswela—, sursul(a)- with the same meaning (ylonti 1984: 495, 502).

CK *stw- 'to whistle; to pipe': Georg, stu 'to whistle; to pipe'; Megr. [Svit-}\ Laz [stv-]; Svan [st-].
Verb stem of a descriptive character, which accounts for irregular reflexes of the initial s and analogies of the stem in other languages (for Megrelian cf. Abx. a-ss^ra, Old Arm. suem 'to whistle', etc. which reflect an "areal norm" of languages of the Caucasus). In an unbound form it is known only in Old Georgian (cf. action noun stuwa- with an evident secondary semantics 'to lie, to tell lies'). Its derivatives are the verb stem *stw-en- : stw-in- and the noun stem *ne-stw-. 1 1 Cf. USKJa: 166 and Klimov (1985: 173).
GZ *stw-en- : stw-in- 'to whistle; to pipe': Georg, stven- : stvin- 'to whistle; to pipe'; Megr. svitin; Laz stvin—, stvin—. Verb stem reflected in Old Georgian (gistwinevdit tkuen...

relates with the Georgian noun formation stvir- 'pipe'. The Megrelian cognate underwent a consonant metathesis. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 314-315). Megrelian: USKJa: 166.
GZ *sur- 'ivy': Georg, sur-o- 'ivy'; Megr. [su$-]; Laz (m)su^-, msig-,
The Georgian lexeme contains the affix -o. Its Megrelian continuant is extracted from the toponym Suguna- < *Su$ona.-, where a typical Zan formant —ona can be identified. The Svan su£-, swig- are overt Zan loanwords (Rogava 1990.1:77). Initial mlI p is secondary in Laz (cf. *sel-, *swe—). The final 3 of Laz regularly corresponds to Georg, r at the end of the substantive. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Marr (1909: 071). Megrelian: Rogava (1990.1: 77).
CK *sx- 'to bear fruit; to grow': Georg, sx- 'to bear fruit; to grow'; Svan [ex-]. Verb stem. Its continuant is attested in Old Georgian: romelsa esxa purceli... 'which had leaves...' Mk. 11.13. For correspondence of the Georgian cluster sx with the Svan ex compare *msxal-, *sxep- : sxip-, *sxerp- : sxirp-, etc. The stem underlies a derivative formation *sx-am- : sx-m- with the same meaning provided with affixation of thematic *-am : -m.
GZ*sxal- : sxl- 'to slide, to glide; to hack, hew (down)': Georg, sxal- : sxl- 'to hew (branches, vine)'; Megr. (r) sxil-. Verb stem. Its continuant is well known in Old Georgian: da sxlven venaqta... 'and (they) hew the rod...' Sin. mr. 159.12; na-sxlev- 'the cut-off rod' (action noun sxlva-, gansxlva-). The Megrelian action noun is (r)sxilua-. Comparison of Georg, sxal- : sxl- with Svan a(r)sxal II arcxal 'branch' (cf. Rogava 1988. 1: 14-17) can hardly be accepted for phonetic reasons. The Svan forms li—sxlaw—i, li—sxlaw—i go back to a Georgian source. Georgian-Zan derivative *sxl-et- : sxl-t- 'to stumble, slip' shows that the actual semantics of the stem is secondary. Its similarity to some descendants of PIE *sk(h)el- 'to stumble' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 929) deserves mention. | | Cf. Klimov (1994: 136-137).

169



*sxep- : sxip
A derivative formation with the thematic affix *-am : -m from *sx- with the same meaning. The stem is well attested in Old Georgian, where there occurs also its nominal derivative m-sxm-o- 'fruit-bearing'. Action noun Georg, sxma-, Svan li-cxem. The stem reflects the variability of old vocalism all e and occurs in the word-forms of the presentic series of tenses. ||Cf. Topuria(1967: 164).

Verb stem represented in Old Georgian texts (Abulage 1973: 408). At its end there is an expressive p. In the Zan languages forms reflecting different vocalism are lexicalized. The vowel a regularly renders here the historical vocalism e. In Laz n must be a phonetic augmentation. Here the change sx > ex has also taken place like in a number of other cases (cf. *zisxl-, *msxal-, *sxwerp-, etc.).

Its continuant is attested in Old Georgian: action noun dasxerpa- (Abulase 1973: 124). The end of the stem shows an expressive p. The Megrelian correspondence underwent metathesis of the sonorant: action noun go(r)sxipua—, cf. mosxipil— 'tight'. The Svan equivalents (action noun li-cxep) reflect some later transformations: the initial complex sx results in ex, whereas the sonorous element is lost. | | Georgian, Svan: Gigineisvili (1984: 39-40).

CK *sxwerp- 'to catch; to encompass': Georg, [sxverp-]; Megr. sxup'to catch, embrace'; Svan cxörp- 'to embrace'. A problematic comparison. In Georgian the verb stem may be extracted only from the derivative noun m-sxverp-l- 'sacrifice, gift' (cf. Old Georg. secire msxuerpli igi seni Offer thy gift' Mt. 5.24). The Megrelian form (action noun sxup-in-} is simplified. Together with the Svan stem it illustrates the change sx > ex. Difficulties in the juxtaposition of the material follow mainly from its semantics. 1 1 Cf. USKJa: 167.

GZ *sxwe(r)t- 'to tear off, pick, break off': Georg, sxvert- 'to break off, pick'; Megr. cxot- 'to cut off (branches); to jump'; Laz cxo(n)t-. Verb stem. Its continuant is well known in Old Georgian (icqes ... sxuertad tavsa quvilisasa '(disciples) began ... to pluck the ears of corn' Mk. 2.23). The Moxev. sxwert- means 'to cut branches to pieces'. Zan forms (action noun Megr. cxotua—, Laz o—cxont—u) are distinguished by a change sx > ex and a simplified final. A different comparison see in Cikobava (1938: 385-386). 1 1 Cf. ESKJa: 167.

In Old Georgian alongside action noun mosxleta(Sar|vela3e 1995: 142) this stem may be found in other extended forms (Abula3e 1973: 298, 321, 408). Cf. further its use in Rustaveli (1404.3). It is derived from the simple base *sxal- : sxl- by adding the affix *-et (cf. Marr 1925: 141), which designates the weakened manner of action. The Megrelian action nouns are cxilatua- and cxilitua-. If the Laz form belongs here, then it is substantially simplified and reflects the historical zero grade: cf. the Laz word-form gemi-lt-u '(my foot) slipped'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: I.

CK *sxmartl- 'medlar': Georg, zymartl- 'medlar'; Megr. cxumu(n)tur-\ Laz cximuntur—; Svan zunt(u)-, zunt(u)-.
Dialectal variations are in abundance in the languages. Cf. Georg. sxmartl—, z(y)martl—\ Megr. ckumuntur—, ckimuntur—, cx(u)mutur—\ Laz ckirmuntur—, ckimut—, cxemuntur—, skilimuntr—; Svan z ntu, zuntw. In Georgian and Svan forms the initial z derives from Λ, accordingly. Georg. γ goes back to a voiceless spirant. The original vocalism is regularly rendered in the languages (in Zan and Svan historical α next to a labial results in u). Svan compensatory lengthening of the vowel apparently points to simplification of the consonant structure of the word. Some difficulties in reconstructing the archetype lie in the initial part of the word. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Marr (1936: 827-828). See also Cikobava (1938: 136). Svan: ESKJa: 168.

*(s)a
Georgian-Zan lexeme. In Old Georgian it is represented by squen(Abula3e 1973: 409). The Zan forms illustrate a change sx > ex. Similar to many other cases the complex we is preserved here. The origin of final d in Megrelian remains obscure. The Megrelian word is sometimessupposed to be a Georgian borrowing (cf.Schmidt 1962: 133). Svan cxwenrepeats one of the Megrelian variants and seems to be borrowed. The reconstruction of an archetype *sqwan- is also possible. Its similarity to PIE *skein—, skoni— 'shade, canopy' deserves mention. However, Arm. (dial.) c'xin-h' with the same meaning might have been a Zan loanword (cf. Abulage 1976:132-133).
(S)
CK(?) *(s)a- word formation prefix: Georg, sä-; Megr. o-\ Laz o-\ Svan
Dates at least from the Georgian-Zan stage. It derives verbal and partly denominative formations, which as a rule have the semantics of asubstantive. Without accompanying co-affixes it occurs rarely (cf. *(s)a-xl-), while derivatives with *(s)a --- al, *(s)a --- ar, *(s)a --- e, *(s)a --- el, *(s)a --- «i are very common. The connection with Svan la-, which is functionally very close, remains unclear. If it is proved to be a phonetic equivalent of the Georgian-Zan *(s)a-, the prefix will be of Common Kartvelian origin. According to Schmidt (1962: 78—79) the correspondence s ~ l goes back to a former lateral i. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 11). Cf. also Deeters (1930: 228-229).
GZ *(s)a-bm-el- 'tie, leash': Georg. sab(m)el- 'tie, leash, rope'; Megr. obumal—.
Deverbative formation. In Old Georgian texts the word occurs in both variants; the form with m usually is found in compounds (Abula3e 1973: 202, 352). It is derived from the verb stem *bam- : bm-. The structure of the short Georgian form (cf. Xevs. sabel-) reflects another wordformation type based on an aoristic stem.
GZ *(s)a-gz-al- 'breakfast (provision) for the way': Georg, sagzal'breakfast'; Megr. orzol-.
172



*(s)a-dg-is,
Denominative formation represented in Old Georgian (micemad sagzali gzasa zeda... 'to give provisions for the way...' Gen. 42.25). It is derived from the noun *gza— with the help of the circumfix *(s)a al. The Zan vocalism corresponds regularly to the Georgian one. The Megrelian word illustrates the change g > r in a consonant cluster. | | Cf.Deeters (1930: 28).
GZ *(s)a-dg-is,- 'awl': Georg, sadgis- 'awl'; Megr. odgis-. Deverbative formation. It is attested in Old Georgian texts (ganuquritos ... sadgisita '(he) shall bore ... with an awl' Ex. 21.6). The lexeme is formed from the verb stem *deg- : dg- with the help of the circumfix *(s)a isi. Both forms are in regular agreement. | | Cagareli (1889: 11).
GZ *(s)a-warcx-ar- 'comb': Georg, savarcxel- 'comb'; Megr. orcxon$—, orcxond—\ Laz o(n)cxo$—.
Deverbative formation which occurs in Old Georgian in the form savarcxal- (Abulaje 1973: 336). It is derived from the simple verb stem *warcx- (see *warcx-wn-). In the Georgian form r apparently results in / in dissimilation with the root r. As in some other cases we have here a change a > e in the last syllable (cf. Macavariani 1958: 275-276). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Lafon (1934: 38). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 180).
GZ *(s)a-war3-el- 'seat': Georg. savar$el- 'arm-chair'; Laz or$u-, or$o-, orzo- 'bench, chair'. Deverbative formation. In Old Georgian it occurs in the forms savar^el- (Abulaje 1973: 356) and savr^el- (Sar^velaje 1995: 173). The word is derived from the verb stem (see *war$—) with the help of the prefix *(s)a- and the suffixal element, which reflects the correspondence between Georgian -el and Zan -u. In Laz there exists a derivative or§αΙοη- 'sound bench'. | | Cikobava (1938: 162).
GZ *(s)a-ws!-e- 'full, complete': Georg, savse- 'full'; Megr. opsa-, epsa—, Laz (j)opsa-.
Adjective widely attested in Old Georgian ($mrita savsej 'full of vinegar' Jn. 19.29). It is derived from the verb stem (see *wes1- : ws}-) with the help of the circumfix *(s)a e. Modern Georgian has the dialectal variants sapse- and samse- (cf. yionti 1984: 479). According to
173



*(s)a-zrd-el

GZ *(s)a-zrd-el- 'food, subsistence': Georg, sazrdel- 'food, subsistence'; Megr. ordal—. Deverbative formation widely attested in Old Georgian: sazrdelad misa iqo mkali... 'his meat was locusts...' Mt 3.4.It is a former participle in circumfix *(s)a el from the verb *zard— : zrd—. The Megreliancorrespondence is strictly regular.
GZ *(s)a-rek-el- 'small bell, bluebell': Georg, sarekel- 'small bell, bluebell'; Laz \prakal-}. Deverbative formation represented in Old Georgian texts (Abulaje 1973: 367).It is derived from the verb stem *rek- by means of the circumfix *(s)a el-. The Laz variant can be extracted from the more extended form orakalon- 'small bell, bluebell'.
GZ *(s)a-rtw-l- 'roof: Georg, sartul- 'floor, storey'; Megr. ortval-. Deverbative formation. In the meaning 'roof, ceiling' the word is widely known in Old Georgian (aygarcues sartuli '(they) uncovered the roof Mk. 2.4). It is derived from the verb stem (see *rtw-) with the help of the circumfix *(s)a /. The vowel α of the Megrelian form needs explanation. ||Cikobava(1942:74).
GZ *(s)a-rc,x-el- 'linen, clothes (for washing)': Georg, sarcxel- 'linen, clothes (for washing)'; Megr. orcxal-. Deverbative formation. The form adduced for Georgian is well known in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 368) and recorded in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani. It is derived from the verb stem *recvx- : rc{x- 'to wash' with the help of the circumfix *(s)a el. In modern Georgian the word has been replaced by the form sarecx-. Georgian and Megrelian forms regularly correspond to each other. ||Cikobava(1938:310).

*(s)a-(s)tum-al
Deverbative formation based on the verb stem *rc- 'to rock, to shake' with the help of the circumfix *(s)a e. In Georgian it is represented by dialectal forms (cf. also a complex form sa—rcev-ela which contains a further suffix transferred from another word-formation class). The identity of the second vowel is regular for the end of substantives and points to a more recent origin of the elements following it. A change r > n took place in Zan. The Svan henc 'cradle' must be considered a Zan loanword.
GZ *(s)a-(s)tum-al- 'head of the bed': Georg, sastumal- 'head of the bed'; Megr. ortumel—; Laz omtunal— 'bearing log of the fire'. Denominative formation. In the form sastumal- the word is attested in Old Georgian (daidva sastunlad... 'put them for his pillows...' Gen. 28.11; cf. stunal— with the same meaning and the adverbial form stunlit). In West-Georgian dialects a secondary form sartumal- is known. The Georgian and Zan material (Laz omtunal- derives from ontumal-) points to the presence of m in the root morpheme. Osije (1987: 34-37) thinks that the word is based on an old Kartvelian designation of ear, reflected in Svan sdim—.

Deverbative formation. In Old Georgian, where the lexeme had also a meaning 'cup, bowl', it is found in the form sasumel- (...cesmariti sasumeli ars '...is drink indeed' Jn. 6.55). The word is derived from the verb stem (see *s{\vam- : sl\vm- 'to drink') with the help of circumfix *(j)a el. | | Cf. USKJa: 170.
GZ *(s)a-cer- 'sieve': Georg, sacer- 'sieve'; Laz oncor(u)-, oncir(u)-. Deverbative formation. The word occurs in Old Georgian texts (Abula3e 1973: 379). It is derived from the verb stem *cer- : cr- with the help of the prefix *(s)a-. In Megrelian the lexeme has been replaced. The Laz form shows a secondary n. The origin of u optionally represented in word-final position has not yet been determined. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 171).
GZ *(s)a-c,em-ar- 'mortar': Georg, sacemar- 'mortar'; Megr. ocamure—; Laz oncamure—.
175



*(s)a—c, nex-el
A technical term. It is a deverbative formation derived from the verb stem *Ciem- with the help of the circumfix *(s)a ar. The final r is not reflected in Zan forms like 3 because of the participial origin of the word. The recently developed n is characteristic for the Laz cognate. 1 1 Schmidt (1962: 149).
GZ *(s)a-C!nex-el- 'wine-press': Georg, sacnexel- 'wine-press'; Megr. ocinax(u)—; Laz ocinoxu—,
Deverbative formation derived from the verbal base *c\nex- 'to press' with the help of the prefix *(ί)α- and suffix showing a correspondence Georg, -el ~ Zan -u. It is attested in Old Georgian (kmna mas sina sacnexeli 'digged a winepress in it' Mt. 21.33). The word belongs to the ancient Kartvelian wine-making terminology. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Savaxisvili (1918: 6). Megrelian: Cikobava (1938: 396).
GZ *(s)a-£m-el- 'food, meal': Georg, sacmel- 'food, meal'; Megr. ockomal—, ockumal—', Laz ockomale—, oskomale—.
Deverbative formation derived from the verb stem *cam- : cm- with the help of the circumfix *(s)a el. The word is also present in most ancient Georgian texts (sacmel gakus rajal 'haven't you any food?' Jn. 21.5). The final vowel of the Laz equivalent must have been of a secondary origin (Deeters 1930: 228-229). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Schuchardt (1902.1: 295). Laz: USKJa: 171.
GZ *(s)a-xl- 'house': Georg, saxl- 'house'; Megr. oxor- 'dwelling, abode; farm-stead'; Laz oxor- 'house'. Deverbative formation. The word contains the prefix *(s)a- and the verbal stem *xal-: xl- 'to be amidst sth, near sth'. It is well known in Old Georgian (ayasena saxli '(he) built a house' Jn. 7.24; cf. also its Old Georgian variant saxel-), where it has a number of derivatives. In Megrelian the lexeme is found also in the derivatives oxoraskil'brother-in-law, sister-in-law' andxorua- < *oxorua- 'to settle'. | | Cikobava (1938: 150-151).
GZ *(s)a-qs-ar- 'coupling, joint, articulation': Georg, saxsar- 'joint, tendon'; Megr. o(n)cxond- 'bearing beam'; Laz o(n)cxon- 'ceiling made of beams'. Deverbative formation. The word is derived from the verb stem *qas- : qs- by adding the circumfix *(s)a ar. In Old Georgian it had a
176



*(s)et- : (s)t
meaning 'redemption, ransom' (misces mas saqsari... 'he shall give for the ransom...' Ex. 21.30). In Zan beside the insertion of secondary n also the metathesis xs > sx > ex took place. The Megr. d goes back to 3which corresponds to Georg, r. The end of the Laz form had the same d: cf. oncxondure- 'the ceiling made of beams'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: T. Gudava. Laz: USKJa: 171-172.
CK *(s)et- : (s)t- 'to spin': Georg, rt- 'to spin'; Megr. rt- 'to spin, to turn'(?); Svan let- : It- 'to spin'. Verb stem reflected as st- in Old Georgian texts (area stavs... 'neither do they spin' Mt. 6.28; action noun stva-). The modern Georgian form coincides with the Zan one. Both of them reflect the zero ablaut grade of the stem. The Megrelian cognate apparently underwent an expansion of meaning. In Laz the stem seems to have been replaced. The Svan (Upper Bal) action noun is li-lt-e. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Deeters (1930: 220). Megrelian: USKJa: 172.
GZ *(s)i- word-forming affix: Georg, si-; Laz i-, e-. Georgian-Zan derivatory prefix which seems to have been unproductive for a long time. As a rule it occurs as part of a circumfix which derives action nouns. The prefix is attested e.g. in the Georgian-Zan *(s)i-zmar- 'dream'. It is supposed to be related to the Svan prefix of the action noun //- (cf. Deeters 1930: 220; Schmidt 1962: 78).
GZ *(s)i-zmar- 'dream': Georg, sizmar- 'dream'; Laz izmoj-, izmoge-, ezmoga-.
Georgian-Zan lexeme formed by adding the prefix *(s)i- to the verb stem *zman-. It can be found in Old Georgian (yitarca sizmari $ilsa sina... 'as a dream of a night vision...' Is. 29.7). The final vocalism in both Laz forms is secondary. 1 1 Marr (1911: 1202).
CK *(s)3ie- 'milk': Georg. r$e- 'milk'; Megr. bza-\ Laz bza-, b$a-, mza-, m$a-\ Svan h$e-.
In Old Georgian the word is recorded in the form s^e- (moiyo erboj da s^ej 'he took butter, and milk' Gen. 18.8). In modern Georgian dialects the variants (r)$e- and ze- are found (cf yionti 1984: 230 and 685). The Zan vowel a needs an explanation because e would be expected. Initial m

*(s)cw
and b are secondary. For the correlation between the Old Georg. 5 and Svan / see *(s)a-, *(s)et- : (s)t- and *(s)i-.
| | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 94). Svan: Janashvili (Erckert 1895: 297). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 94).
GZ *(s)£w- 'to drive, knock (in), stick in(to)': Georg, [rev-] 'to knock in, stick in'; Laz [ck(v)—]. Verb stem represented in Old Georgian in the substantive m—scw-al'point, spike, edge' and its derivative action noun (gan)mscualva- 'to stick in, plunge, thrust (into)' (cf. Abulase 1973: 298; Sar^ve^e 1995: 34), which was used with various preverbs. The correspondence of the forms is regular. In accordance with Gamkrelidze's law historical *cw results in Laz in ckv. Cf. *m-(s)cw-al-.
s,
CK *Si-pronominal stem: Georg, [s-]; Megr. [s-]; Laz [s-]; Svan [s-]. Pronominal stem; it may be extracted from a number of its derivatives: see *a-s}-, *e-s}-, *i-Si-, The original deictic function of the stem remains obscure.
GZ *Siar- : Sir- 'to destroy, ruin': Georg, sar- : sr- 'to destroy, ruin'; Megr. sir-, S9r- 'to wear out; to destroy'; Laz sir- 'to wear out; to evaporate'. Verb stern which is represented in the Old Georgian texts (mosrna kueqanaj... 'the land was corrupted...' Ex. 8.24). The Zan forms (cf. Megr. action noun do-sir-ua-, Lazp-sir-ap Ί wear out') reflect the zero ablaut grade. Since the Megrelian stem preserves also the meaning 'to destroy, ruin', maximum semantic difference characterizes the Georgian and Laz cognates. | | Cikobava (1938: 365-366).
CK *Sier- : SIT- 'to sharpen': Georg, [sr-] 'to sharpen'; Svan ser-. Verb stem. In modern Georgian beside its mention by S. Orbeliani it is identified in Moxev. sa—sr—ev— 'whetstone, grindstone' (yionti 1984: 476). While the latter form reflects the zero grade of the stem, the Svan action noun li—ser-e reflects its full grade. | | Penrixi-Sar$velage (1990: 281).
178



*s,w
CK *$iW- 'to drink': Georg, sv- 'to drink'; Megr. s(v}-·, Laz s(v)-; Svan
*M-V>erb stem. Its continuant is well known in Old Georgian (su da aklemta senta asu\ 'Drink, and give thy camels drink also' Gen. 24.14). The stem-final w followed by the affixal -u in Zan languages and Svan disappears: cf. Megr. kos-u 'he drank', but osv-es 'they drank', Svan lalas 'he drank', but mi-sw-a Ί drank' (result.). The stem occurs in the verbal word-forms of the aoristic tenses. Cf. derived *s\w-am- : SiW-m-. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 78). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 360). Svan: Topuria (1979: 9).
GZ *s1w-am- : s,w-m- 'to drink'; Georg, svam- : sm- 'to drink'; Megr. sum:, Laz sum-.
Verbal formation. The stem is derived from the base *j,w- by affixation of thematic *-am : —m. It is attested in Old Georgian (camen do swnan '(they) eat and drink' Lk. 5.33), where its full ablaut grade shows non-functional alternation suam- II suem-. The stem occurs in the wordforms of the presentic tenses. The Zan forms (action noun Megr. sumua-, Laz o-sum-u) apparently reflect the zero grade.
CK *SiWan- 'Svan': Georg, svan— 'Svan'; Megr. son—; Svan swan 'Svanetia'. Represented in Old Georgian texts as suan- (Sar|vela3e 1995: 194). It is one of the most important Kartvelian ethnonyms. Contrary to other Kartvelian languages in Svan the stem occurs in its simple shape only in the plural: swan-ar. Its singular form is ma-swan II mu-swan II mu-sw n (the form swan has here a toponymic function referring to Svanetia). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918 VI). Laz: Gamqreh^e (1959: 17). Svan: S. lanasia (Sromebi, Vol. Ill, Tbilisi, 1959: 2).
CK *$iwen- : s,wn- 'to breathe, sigh; to rest': Georg, sven- 'to rest'; Megr. [ίνα«-] 'to breathe, sigh'; Laz svan-; Svan swem— : swm- 'to rest'. Verb stem. Its reflex is well attested in Old Georgian (ganisuenet mcired! 'rest a while!' Mk. 6.31). It must be related to the Georgian substantive sun— 'breath, smell'. In Megrelian the stem can be found in a set of expressions like art svans Once', namu svans 'when'. In Laz it occurs independently (cf. suri dobisvanasi... 'with (each my) breath...'). The Svan stem is characterized by a final consonant, which possibly testifies to a historically complex structure of the protoform. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: USKJa: 174. Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 11).
179



*s,wer
CK *$iwer- 'sigh, breath': Georg, [sver-] 'sigh'; Megr. svanj- 'rest'; Laz sva$- 'rest, respite'; Svan swär- 'sigh'. In Georgian the lexeme is lost and can be traced in the verbal correlative sur- (see *s}wer- : Si\vr-). In the Zan languages the lexeme forms the basis of the denominative verb (action noun Megr. mosvanda-, svanga-; Laz o-svag-in-u 'to rest'). Megrelian word-initial s is a result of dissimilation with 3 which testifies to the denominative origin of the corresponding verb. The noun stem is also represented in Svan: swär ankid 'he sighed'. Arm. sung, sunc 'breath, soul' derives according to Marr (191 1-1914 V: 181) from a Zan source; however, it can be explained as well in Indo-European terms. Machavariani.
CK *stwer- : s^r- 'to sigh': Georg, sur- 'to wish'; Megr. sur- 'to smell'; Laz sur- 'to smell (at), smell (of)'; Svan swr-, sur- 'to sigh'. Verb stem well known form Old Georgian sources: action noun surveba-, survil- 'wish, desire' (Abula3e 1973: 406). The full grade of the stem can be reconstructed by comparing it with its noun correlative (see the preceding entry). The Georgian form shows a deviation in meaning. For the Zan languages cf. Megr. go—sur—apa—, for Svan cf. action noun li-sur-jel. \ | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 366). Georgian: Machavariani.
GZ *s,wl-ep- : s,wl-ip- 'to eat (champing, smacking one's lips); to lap': Georg, svlep- : svlip- 'to eat (sipping), to lap'; Megr. slip-; Laz slip-. Verbal formation unattested in Old Georgian. It may be based on the verb stem *slowl- 'to wet, to become wet' and belongs to the stems with the expressive p in their enlargement. The Zan form is distinguished by a simplified consonant cluster: action noun Megr. slipua- Laz o-slip-u. In Megrelian the stem has a connotation 'to strike, hit; coire'. | | Cf. Klimov (1988: 159).
GZ *Sii- 'to make noise, rustle': Georg, siv-il- 'to whistle; to rustle'; Laz si- 'rustle, noise'. Verb stem of the descriptive type. In Georgian its action noun is marked by -il, an affix characteristic for such verbs. 1 1 Fähnrich (1980: 73).
CK *s,i(w)- 'to swell, swell up': Georg, s/v- 'to swell, swell up'; Megr. sm-; Svan si(w)-.
180



*s,i(w)-Sii(w)n
Verb stem attested in Old Georgian texts (dausivdes perqni misni 'her feet swelled out' Krest 156.37; action noun gansiveba—). w probably is to be reconstructed at the end of the stem: cf. the Georgian action noun siveba- and Svan derivative m&-si(\v) 'swollen'. The Megrelian form (action noun sin-αρά-) together with Georg, si-m-sivn-e 'swelling' presupposes the existence of the later protoform *s}iw-n-. The GeorgianZan *j|W|//i- apparently depends on the stem. || Georgian, Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 11). See also Deeters (1930: 205). Megrelian: ESKJa: 111.
GZ *s,i(w)-Sii(w)n- 'to stuff oneself: Georg, sisin- 'to stuff oneself; Megr. sisin—.
Verbal formation unattested in Old Georgian. Action noun Georg. gasisineba—, Megr. gosisinapa—. It is likely to be a reduplication of the simple Common Kartvelian stem *sli(w)-. In Laz no certain cognate is found. 1 1 Kipsidze (1914: 357).
CK *8ιΪ3ιβ- 'son-in-law, bridegroom': Georg. si$e- 'son-in-law'; Megr. si(n)$a-, sinda-', Laz si$a- 'son-in-law, bridegroom'; Svan cize 'son-inlaw'. Widely represented in Old Georgian, where it was used in the meaning 'bridegroom, fiance'(aha esera si$ej movals 'Behold, the bridegroom cometh' Mt. 25.6). The reflex of the etymological $\ is regular in all languages. In Zan stem-final e changes in a due to the addition of the secondary / in the plural forms: Megr. sinda-l-epi. Word-initial c of the Svan cognate needs a convincing explanation. For an alternative reconstruction see Penrixi-Sar^velase (1990: 272). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 79). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 36). Svan: Topuria (IKE XII: 153).
GZ *s,lok- 'to hiccup': Georg, slok- 'to hiccup'; Megr. sikin-; Laz sikin-; Svan sdakun-, stukun-(?).
Onomatopoetic verb stem (cf. Germ, schlucken alongside PIE *(s)leuk-: see Pokorny 1959: 964); thus it does not show regular sound correspondences in the languages. Cf. also Georg, sluk-sluk- 'hiccup'. Georgian-Zan -in is a historical suffix. The relation of the Svan forms to this stem requires clarification. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 364). Svan: ESKJa: 177.
181



*SiOW
GZ *s1ow- 'to be wet': Georg, [sov-] 'to be wet, soak'; Laz suv-. Verb stem. In its unbound state it occurs only in Laz: cf. a-suv-u '(his, him sth.) became wet' (cf. also osuvoni mama 'the rain making you soaked, downpour'). The stem underlies the adjective *s\ow-el- (see below). || Sar$vela3e( 1970: 233).
GZ *s,ow-el- 'wet, soaked': Georg, sovel-, sobel- 'wet, soaked'; Megr. S3-; Laz su-.
Deverbative adjective. Both Georgian forms are dialectal (yionti 1984: 498) alongside Standard Georgian svel-. The stem belongs to the formations showing at their end the phonetic correspondence of Georgian -el and Zan —u. In its turn it serves as underlying base for the GeorgianZan verb stem *s\owl-. On the juxtaposition of the material see the preceding entry.
GZ *s,owl- 'to wet, make wet': Georg, [sov/-] 'to wet, make wet'; Megr. sol—; Laz sol-.
Verb stem. The Georgian form is attested in ancient texts: cf. the action noun dasovleba—, sesovleba— (Abulase 1973: 400). Georg, dasveleba— is a later denominative formation (see *slowel—). The Zan match regularly corresponds to the Georgian one: action noun Megr. solua- (solir- 'wet, soaked'), Laz o-sol-u. Despite Acaryan (1977: 529) Arm. sot 'dampness, moisture' most likely derives from Zan. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 362—363). The comparison with the Georgian cognate see under *s,cw-.
GZ *SiUl- 'soul, spirit': Georg, sul- 'soul, breath, smell'; Megr. stir-; Laz sur—.
Amply attested in Old Georgian texts (ganixam sulman cemman 'my soul was delighted' Sin. mr. 13.35—36). Here it had a number of derivatives (Abula3e 1973: 404-405). The word is undoubtedly related to *s,wen : Si\vn- and *s,wer- : s\wr-. Cf. the Laz derivative sur-on'fragrant, odorous'. | | Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 32). Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 51).
CK *SiUS]— 'to be silent, be quiet': Georg, sus— 'to be silent, be quiet'; Megr. sus- 'quiet, calm'; Svan sus- 'to fall silent'. Verb stem. Its characteristic phonetic shape allows us to assume its interjectional origin. However, a connection with forms such as Georg.
182



*s,uq
sul or Svan sud\ 'be silent, be quiet!' is hardly possible phonetically. The Svan (action noun li-ssw-e, ad-sus-e '(he) made (sby.) to be silent') and Megrelian cognates show a regular correspondence to the Georgian stem. Arm. sus 'silently' may possibly go back to a Georgian source. | | Fähnrich (1982: 36; 1985: 27).
CK *Siuq- 'to grow stout, fat': Georg, suq- 'to grow stout, fat'; Svan nsq-.
Not found in Old Georgian. For modern Georgian cf. the action noun suqeba- and a derivative attributive msuqe- Obese, grown fat'. The Svan equivalent one sees in the action noun li-n-sq-e 'to grow fat, fatten', where n requires an explanation. From a semantic point of view the lexeme reflects a cattle-breeding structure of the economy. | | Schmidt (1961: 150).
GZ *s,uS- 'to dry up; to bake well': Georg, sus- 'to dry up; to bake well'; Laz susk- 'to bake well, fry'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian sources. Action noun - dasuseba(Sar|vela3e 1995: 72). Its Laz action noun is o—susk—u (cf. attributive susker- 'well-baked, fried'). The reflection of the protoform is regular in both languages. A reconstruction *sus- is also possible. In the latter case one has to assume assimilation of the word-initial s in Georgian. The stem is one of the old Indo-Iranian borrowings: cf. Old Ind. sus- 'to dry'. 1 1 Kartozia (1984); Penrixi-Sar^ve^e (1990: 385).
GZ *S!X- 'to hang, to sit (about multitude)': Georg, sx- 'to hang, to sit (about multitude)'; Megr. sx- 'to hang, to encircle (about multitude)'. Verb stem. It is well known in Old Georgian texts (romelsa esxa purceli... 'having leaves...' Mk. 11.13; cf. sx-d-a '(people) were sitting', msxdomare— 'sitting' and others). Cf. Megr. mi-v-o—sx-st 'we attacked, surrounded him'. In both languages the stem is a polysemantic one; among its meanings one finds 'to sit; to plant, put; to attack, drive; to have'. Cf. also its derivative *slx-am- : slx-m-. | | Cf. USKJa: 178.
GZ *s]x-am- : SiX-m- 'to hang, to sit (about multitude)': Georg, sxam- : sxm- 'to hang; to sit (about multitude)'; Megr. sxim-, sxam-. Found in Old Georgian with various preverbs: eri igi daesxmoda mas smenad sitquata ymrtisata 'the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God' Lk. 5.1; action nouns sxma—, dasxma—, etc.). It is derived from
183



*s,xat- :
the simple verbal base *iijc- by adding the thematic suffix *-am : -m. Similar to the underlying base it is polysemantic at least in Georgian. Cf. Megrelian action noun sximua-, sxsmua-. The stem is used in wordforms of the presentic tenses.
CK(?) *s,xat- : SjXt- 'to fence, hedge': Georg, [sxt-, sxlt-, xst-] 'to fence, hedge'; Svan sxat- : sxt-. Verb stem. In Georgian it is found in the deverbative form sx(l)t-e'wattle fencing' (with the suffix -e) and its dialectal variants. In Svan the stem occurs as a verb: action noun li-sxt-en-i 'to fence'. | | Deeters (cf. Schmidt 1962: 134).
GZ ^xw- 'to be fat, stout, large': Georg, [msxv-] 'to be large'; Megr. [ijttt-]; Laz [(m)cxu-]. Verb stem absent in Kartvelian languages in an unbound form. It may be extracted from the derivative adjective *(m)sixw-il-. The Georgian si-(m)sx-o 'with the fatness of. ..' is also derived from the stem. Compare also Laz mcxvana- 'stoutness'. The protoform was reconstructed by G. Machavariani. | | Cf. Cikobava (1938: 232).
CK *s,xwa- One; other': Georg, sxva- Other, another; foreign'; Megr. sxva-; Laz ckwa- Other, one more'; Svan esxu One'. The numeral is well attested in Old Georgian (ars sx.ua mraval... 'are many other (things)...' Jn. 21.25). Cf. dialectal sxo—, cxva—, cxo— (yionti 1984: 503, 681). In Laz the change s > c takes place conditioned by sandhi in the high-frequency word-combination art sxva > arckva Once again, once more'. Cf. Svan asxw (dative case), where the consonant cluster is provided with a protethic vowel with the timbre lost at the end of the word. Georgian-Zan *e-rt- One' is an innovation. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 61). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 246). Svan: P. Ertelishvili (1950: 203).
GZ(?) *tal- 'flint': Georg, tal- 'flint'; Megr. [to/-]. Attested in Old Georgian (Sar^velaje 1995: 196). In the modern language the word is used primarily in the mountain dialects - Tus.,
184



*tax
Moxev., Xevs. (ylonti 1984: 506). Its regular Zan equivalent can be seen in Svan tol- 'flint', whose final / makes it possible to consider it a loanword from Megrelian (where the lexeme is not recorded). Further borrowings from the Kartvelian source may be represented in Ingush tol-g 'pebble' and Chechen tul-g 'small stone' (with a well-known Nax wordforming suffix). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Fähnrich (1982: 36).
GZ *tax- 'to break, to strike (on)': Georg, tax- 'to break, to strike (on)'; Megr. toe-. Verb stem. It must be treated as apophonic transformation of the verb root *tex- : tx- with the same meaning. Action noun tax-tin- 'breaking'. The Megrelian cognate (action noun toxua-) regularly corresponds to the Georgian stem | | Fähnrich (1982: 36).
CK *tba- 'lake': Georg, tba- 'lake'; Megr. toba- 'lake'; Laz toba-, tiba'lake, pond'; Svan tub(a) 'ravine, lake'. The word is also recorded in Old Georgian (ars lerusalejms ... tbaj 'there is at Jerusalem ... a pool' Jn. 5.2). The identity in the final vowel of the substantive is regular. The deviating Megrelian tobo- 'deep' must be explained by the adjectival function of the form. The vowel alternation of Zan / : Svan u : Georgian 0 points to the adequacy of the protoform. Zan variations alongside Georgian toponyms Taba xmela- and Tabis qurpoint to the former existence of a parallel protoform with middle vowel a (Svan tomb- 'pool' seems to be borrowed). | | Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 34). Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 76). Svan: USKJa: 179.
GZ *te(w)- 'to leave, let go': Georg, tev- 'to leave, let go'; Megr. tal-\ Laz tal- 'to leave'. Verb stem. Its direct continuation is represented in Old Georgian (martoj damiteva me 'hath left me (to serve) alone' Lk. 10.40; action noun dateveba—), whereas the form tov— is typical of modern Georgian. In Megrelian the stem shows sometimes a complex interaction with the borrowing from Georgian: cf. noun of action taleba- alongside teeba-. For Laz cf. do-m-i-tal-es '(they) left me'. It belongs to the series of forms illustrating the correspondence Georg, v ~ Zan / in the stem-final position. | | Cikobava (1938: 320-321). Cf.also Vogt (1947: 56-57).
185



*te(w)- : ti(w)
GZ *te(w)- : ti(w)- 'to go in; to be contained': Georg. te(v}- : ti(v)- 'to contain'; Megr. («)?/>-, (n)ti-, tr-, Laz (n)ti(r)-, (n)ti(n)-, (n)tr-.
Verb stem well known from Old Georgian texts (romeli sem^lebul ars datevnad, daitien 'He that is able to receive it, let him receive it' Mt. 19.12). The Georgian action noun is leva-. In Zan we find only the vocalism /. The origin of the more usual Zan stem (n)tir— // \n)tr— (cf. Megr. dmtireno? and Laz intreni? 'does it fit in?') needs clarification. What is its relation to the stem in the preceding entry? 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 326); cf. Vogt (1947.1: 55).
GZ *ten- 'to fill, to stuff, pack (tight) with': Georg, ten- 'to fill, pack (tight) with'; Megr. tin-. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (camadita desteno... 'fill with food...' Sin. mr. 109.37: action noun datena-). It is undoubtedly somehow related to *te(w)- : ti(w)-. In Megrelian the stem is found in the reduplicated formation titin-apa- 'to stuff tight' and apparently in a variant of the preceding stem (n)ti-. For Laz cf. the action noun o-(n)ti(n)-u 'to contain'. | | Cf. USKJa: 180.
CK(?) *tep- 'bark, crust, peel': Georg, tep- 'sole (of boot)'; Svan tep 'birch bark, crust, peel'. A problematic juxtaposition. Its Georgian continuation is attested in Old Georgian (yidre qamlis tepadmde... 'to a shoe latchet...' Gen. 14.23), and possibly in dialectal (Upp. Imer.) tepa- 'bark'. For Svan cf. also a-tp-ur-e '(he) skins'. Ί | Cf. USKJa: 180.
GZ *tep- : tp- 'to warm, heat; to warm oneself: Georg, tb- 'to warm, heat; to warm oneself; Megr. tib-, teb-; Laz tub-, tib-. Verb stem amply attested in Old Georgian (dga da tpeboda 'stood and warmed himself Jn. 18.25; cf.gan-v-tep Ί warmed myself; action noun tpoba-). While the zero grade of the stem is reflected in all these languages (cf. action noun Megr. tibin—, Laz o—tub—u) its full grade appears only in Georgian. The modern Georgian form underwent also a change t > t. For Svan li-tbid-e based on tebdi, tebid, tebedi 'warm' see *tp-il-). The Georgian-Zan stem points to an Indo-European source, cf. PIE *tep- (cf. Pokorny 1959: 1069). | | Cf. Topuria (1979: 35).

*tex- : tx
CK *tex- : tx- 'to break': Georg, tex- : tq- 'to break'; Megr. tax-; Laz tax-; Svan [tx-].
Verb stem. It is found with its derivatives in Old Georgian (ganitexa purni igi '(he) brake the loaves' Mk. 6.41). The zero ablaut grade of the stem is preserved in the Georgian action noun tqdoma- 'to break', whereas the Zan vocalism regularly reflects the full grade (cf. action noun Megr. taxua-, Laz o-tox-u). The Svan correspondence may be discerned in the derivative Ια-txi 'chisel'. The stem may have an onomatopoeic origin (cf. Laz taxa-taxal 'bang!'). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103). Laz: Marr (1936: 63). Cf. also Deeters (1930: 125). Svan: Schmidt (1962: 134).
GZ *tex—a— 'breaking': Georg, texa— 'breaking'; Megr. taxa— 'breaking, ache'; Laz taxa—. Deverbative formation. A historical form of the action noun of the verb stem *tex- : tx- 'to break'. The form is recorded in Old Georgian texts (Abula3e 1973: 412). Cf. also Megr. dudis taxa- 'headache' (different from the action noun taxua- being in use today).
GZ *tex-il- 'broken': Georg, texil- 'broken'; Megr. taxil-\ Laz [toxer-]. Occurs in Old Georgian sources (cf. Abula^e 1973: 41). It is a past participle in -// based on the verb stem *tex- : tx- 'to break'. Its Laz continuant can be identified in the form mo—toxer— with the same meaning.
CK *twar- : twr- 'to light (up)': Megr. tur- 'to kindle'; Svan twar- : twr- 'to light (up)'. Apparently a Common Kartvelian verb stem unattested in Georgian. Action nouns: Megr. itoturapa- (cf. past participle itoturapil- 'enkindled'), Svan li-twar 'to light up' and li-twr-e 'to light (sth.)'. Cf. the Svan derivatives mu—twar and le—twr-e 'candle': esxu letwre txurm sxetwri... One enkindles one candle at the head of the bed...' (Sv. P. 164. 60).
GZ *twin- 'brain': Georg, tvin- 'brain'; Megr. tvin-, tven-. In the form twin- it is represented in Old Georgian (twini misi ganpenil iqo 'his bones are moistened (with marrow)' Job 21.24; hence the action noun gan-twin-v-a- 'to smash'). In Laz the word seems to have been lost. MCf. USKJa: 181.
187



*til
CK *til- 'louse': Georg, til- 'louse'; Megr. ti(j)-\ Laz mti-, mtij-; Svan tis.
Well known from Old Georgian (tili.,. dasxmul iqo 'it was swarmed... with lice' Krest. 156.25-26). The word-final / of the Zan cognate is lost, whereas its initial m is a secondary augmentation. It is an example of correspondence between Georg. / and Svan s. Sometimes one believes that the Svan form has been borrowed from a Zan source (cf. Cikobava 1942: 118). The word underlies the verb stem *tis1-wn-. || Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 113). Laz: Schuchardt (1902.2: 392-393). Svan: Wardrop (1911: 613).
GZ *tis!-wn- 'to seek for insects, examine clothes with the object of insects': Georg, tizn- 'to seek for insects, examine clothes with the object of finding insects'; Megr. tison—; Laz tison—, tisin—. Verbal formation undoubtedly related to the above-mentioned *///-. It contains the historical word-forming affix *-wn. The dialectal Georgian (Kartl.) tisvn- corresponds precisely to the Zan cognates in the phonetics (action nouns Megr. tisonua-, Laz o-tison-u). In Laz there is also a variant where ο has been changed into i: ti utisinums 'cleans, combs out his hair' (CT I 55.27-28). Despite Kipsidze (1914: XX) the stem has nothing to do with Arm. tasel 'to stroke'. ||Cf. USKJa: 181.
CK(?) *titin- 'to stuff, fill (tight)': Megr. titin- 'to fill, stuff (tight)'; Svan teten-, tten- 'to fill to the brim'. The native character of the Svan forms remains in doubt. The stem can be treated as a reduplication of the simple verbal base *te(w)- : ti(w)-. In this connection see Vogt (1947.1: 55). Cf. also *ten-. | | Cf. SSKJa: 183.
CK *tkeb— : tkb— 'to press, press oneself: Georg, tkeb— : tkb— 'to press'; Laz tkab-, ntkab- 'to press, squeeze'; Svan tkeb- : tkb-. Verb stem. Its continuant is widely used in Old Georgian (davtkebnne perqita cemita... 'I'll trample under foot...' Krest 193.22; action noun tkebna-). The historical zero grade of the stem is likely to be reflected in Old Georgian se-tkb-ob-a- II se-tqb-ob-a- 'to press, to embrace'). The Georg, tkbil— 'sweet' may possibly belong here too. The Laz and Svan equivalents (Laz action noun o-(n)tkab-u, Svan —li—tkeb) correspond regularly to the Georgian stem. Cf. a derivative verb stem *tkep~.
188



*tkep
GZ *tkep- 'to press, trample': Georg, tkep- 'to trample'; Laz tkap-, ntkap-,
Verb stem. The action noun tkepna- is attested in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 412). It represents an expressive transformation of the verb stem *tkeb- : tkb-. For the expressive function of the glottalized p see *zep-, *zop—, *sxep-, *s}wlep-, *cql—ep-, *xwlep—, etc.
CK *tkerc,- : tkrc,- 'to crack, crash': Georg, tkrc- 'to crack, crash'; Megr. tkarc-; Svan tksrc-.
Verb stem revealing the regular phonetic correspondences in modern languages. It occurs in Georgian medieval literature (cf. Rustaveli 1414.4). In Laz the stem has evidently been lost. The word has an obvious onomatopoeic character also reflected in the word-formation suffixes of the action noun: cf. Georg, tkrc-ial-, Megr. tkarc-al-, Svan tkarc-sn-. \ | Georgian, Megrelian: Fähnrich (1982: 36). Svan: Klimov (1985: 173).
GZ *tkec- 'to skin, bark': Georg, tkec- 'to skin, bark'; Megr. tkic-. Verb stem. In Old Georgian it is identified in the past participle natkec- 'scrap' (cf. Abulase 1973: 322 and 412). The Megrelian continuant of the stem shows a vowel alternation e : i: cf. tkecir-, tkicil'stripped'. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1985: 24).
CK *tkec,- : tkd- 'to strike': Georg, tkec- : tkic- 'to strike'; Megr. tkac-, Svan tkec- : tkc- 'to strike (with a stick)'. Verb stem. In modern Georgian its continuant is used mainly in dialects (Xevs., Tus.). Perhaps, here belongs also the Old Georgian tkec: tkic- which is identified in mtkice- 'strong, firm, stable' (Abula3e 1973: 300) and in the participle damtkecil- 'confirmed'. Megrelian (action noun tkacua-) and Svan (action noun li-tkc- ) equivalents regularly correspond to the Georgian one. The Svan stem reflects two grades of the historical vowel alternation. 1 1 Klimov (1960: 25).
CK *tkwer- : tkwr- 'to crack (a nut)': Georg, tkver- 'to crack (a nut)'; Megr. tkvar-, ntkvar-; Laz tkvar-; Svan tkur-n-.
Verb stem. While the Georgian and Zan forms reflect full grade (action noun Georg, tkvera—, Megr. (n)tkvarua—), Svan retains only the zero grade. Modern Georgian knows also a dialectal (Gur.) variant tqver—. The
189



*tkw(l)ep
Svan continuant is expanded by an affixal element: cf. the action noun li-tkurn-e.
| | Georgian, Megrelian: T. Gudava. Svan: ASKJa: 182.
GZ *tkw(l)ep- 'to champ, to smack one's lips (whilst eating)': Georg. tkvlep- : tkvlip- 'to champ, to smack one's lips'; Megr. tkvap-. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. Its onomatopoeic nature is indicated in particular by expressive p. Action noun Georg, tkvlepa—, Megr. tkvapua—. Common Kartvelian sound symbolism connects the stem with *dgw(l)ep-. In Georgian the stem occurs in dialectal speech. 1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 36).
CK *tl- 'to eat up (about worms)': Georg. //- 'to eat up (about worms)'; Megr. [tul-]; Laz [ft//-]; Svan [/-]· Verb stem. In Old Georgian it is represented by the action noun tl-ob-a- 'worm eating' (Abulase 1973: 413). Cf. also Georg, tl-u- 'worm eaten tree (without branches)'. According to Sar^velaje (1980: 116) this stem underlies the Common Kartvelian derivative *matl- 'worm'. Some authors note its similarity to the Indo-European designations of decay and plant-louse. (1980: 116-117).
GZ *tlap- 'mud': Georg, tlapo- 'mud': Laz tolop-. There is a form tlap- in "Middle Georgian" (Besiki), where the wordfinal consonant became similar to the initial one in glottality. Connection with synonymic Georgian lap- remains unclear. In Megrelian no certain equivalent is found. | | Kartozia (1979: 66).
GZ *tlek- : trk- 'to lick, lick oneself: Georg, tlek- 'to lick, lick oneself; Megr. tirk-. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. The Georgian (action noun tleka-) and Megrelian (action noun tirkua-) cognates seem to reflect different ablaut grades of the stem vocalism. In Megrelian zero grade is preserved. A possible relation to Megr. tark-al- 'to chatter' needs further study. | | Fähnrich (1982: 36).
GZ *tli(n)k- 'lower part of a leg': Georg, tlink- 'lower part of leg; kicking by hooves'; Laz trik- 'shin, hoof.
190



*tnt-al
Unattested in Old Georgian. For the modern language cf. also dialectal (Moxev.) flunk- 'hoof and tlunkva- 'to kick'. There is a simplified Xopa form tik— in Laz beside the full form represented in Vice and Arx. dialects. The semantic similarity of the lexemes is obvious. Georg. tlik-in- 'to go with long strides' and Megr. ti(r)konua- 'to run headlong' seem to be its derivatives. | | Kutelia (1989: 33).
GZ *tnt-al- 'to drag along, stagger': Georg, tant-al- 'to drag along, stagger'; Megr. tint-ol-. Verbal formation. Apart from the first vowel Georgian and Megrelian cognates correspond phonetically to each other. The stem contains a historical suffixation *—al (Megrelian action noun is tintolua—). For the root morpheme compare also Old Georgian mi-tont-man—eba— 'to stagger'. The comparison with Svan li—tartan 'to stagger' remains uncertain. Can Arm. dandatel 'to linger, loiter' be somehow connected? | | Cf. Klimov (1985: 174).
GZ *top- 'to spawn': Georg, top- 'to spawn'; Megr. (n)top-. Verb stem. It is not recorded in Old Georgian. One notes also a dialectal variant tob— as well as a substantive top- 'spawning place'. Cf. the Megrelian action noun topua— and a designation of small fish top—. The toponym O-ntop-o, literally 'spawning', must be treated as a regular derivative of the stem. The relation of Laz o-ntop-u 'to dip in' to this stem is not quite clear.
GZ *trad- 'dove': Georg, (m)tred- 'dove'; Megr. torong-; Laz to(r)o^'dove (and other dove-type birds)'. It is amply attested in Old Georgian texts (prdides ... tredsa '(they) sold ... doves' Jn. 2.14). The Georgian and Zan vocalism is based on the protoform *trad- assuming umlaut on the pre-Georgian level. Cf. Sar^vela^e (1985: 199). Georg, m in word-initial position is a secondary augmentation. Deeters (1927: 6) assumes a syncope in the Georgian form. The Zan equivalent underwent a change *d > j. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Deeters (ibidem). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 104).
GZ *tua- 'udder': Georg, tua-, tu- 'udder'; Megr. tu-, fa-; Laz tua-, turn- 'bag'; Svan tua 'udder (fat)' (?). In modern Georgian it has the status of a dialectal (Lecx., Gur., Imer.) word (yionti 1984: 517). The Laz stem underwent a semantic shift. The
191



*tuta
Svan (Lasx.) lexeme does not seem to be original. The stem has a soundsymbolic shade. Cf. Darg. uti, Tab. tta 'udder'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Axvlediani (1938: 159).
CK(?) *tuta- 'ashes': Georg, tuta- 'alkali'; Megr. tuta- 'ashes'; Laz mtuta-; Svan tet(a), dst(a).
The identity of the vowel a is regular at the end of the substantive stem. The Svan forms are sometimes considered to have been borrowed from some other Kartvelian language. The initial d must be the result of dissimilation. Semantic deviation characterizes the Georgian word. | | Cikobava (1938: 160-161).
GZ *tp-il- 'warm': Georg, tbil- 'warm'; Megr. tibu-, tabu-; Laz tibu-, tubu—.
Deverbal noun formation. It is a historical participle with the affix *-i7 based on the verb stem *tep- : tp-. In Old Georgian it was attested in the form tpil— (Abulase 1973: 414). The toponym Cqal-tubo- reveals its Zan origin and seems to point to an earlier final o in the Zan forms. The irregular Svan tebdi, tebedi 'warm' might have been borrowed from Ossetic tcevdce 'warm' (cf. Abaev 1979: 283). 1 1 Bopp (1847: 75), Dzanasvili (1902: 9).
GZ *tqaw- 'hide': Georg, tqav- 'hide, skin'; Megr. tqeb-\ Laz t(k)eb-'
The stem is well represented in Old Georgian (sartqeli tqavisaj 'leathern girdle' Jn. 3.4). In Zan the history of the word final remains unclear. Compare also Megr. tqabarua- 'to strip the skin off' with a word-forming affix -or. Deeters (1955: 32) asks whether the stem is related to *matql- 'wool'. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 70).
CK *tqar- : tqr- 'pedere; to have diarrhoea': Georg, tqar-: tqr- 'to clatter'; Megr. tqor-in- 'pedere'; Laz t(k)o(r)-in-\ Svan tqr-sn- 'to have diarrhoea'. Verb stem. In Georgian it is attested in the dialectal (Psav.) action noun tqroma- 'to clatter' (yionti 1973: 520). Whereas the Zan continuants reflect a full ablaut grade, Svan retains a zero grade. The Zan cognates are characterized by the affix -in. | | Zan, Svan: USKJa: 184. Georgian: Fähnrich (1984: 43^4).
192



*tqe(n)
CK(?) *tqe(n)- 'forest, tree': Georg, tqe- 'forest'; Megr. tqa- 'wood, weed'; Laz (m)tka- 'grass, dog-rose'; Svan tqen- 'piece of wood, stick'. The lexeme is known in Old Georgian (Abu^e 1973: 414). The correlation of the vocalism of the Georgian and Zan words may point to a former e in closed syllable, an assumption supported not only by the Zan plural form (cf. Megr. tqal-ep-), but also by the Svan word. Still the meaning of the latter causes a difficulty. For the meaning of the protoform cf. Georg. (Moxev.) tqe- 'tree, log'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 2).See also Marr (1911-1914 VI: 423). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 247). Svan: USKJa: 184.
GZ *tqw- to report, to let know': Georg, tqv- 'to say; to report'; Megr. tqv-.
Verb stem represented in Old Georgian texts (or vici rasa itqw know not what you sayest' Mt. 26.70); the action noun tqueba-. Georg. tqu(v)il'to tell lies, lie' (Abulage 1973: 415) seems also to belong here. The Megrelian form is identical with the Georgian one: cf. the action noun tqveba-.
\\Cf.USKJa: 184.
CK *tqirb- 'spleen': Georg, tqirb-, tqirp- 'spleen'; Megr. tqil-; Svan
In Old Georgian there occurs the form tqirb- (Abulaje 1973: 415). The Megrelian variant tqip- is likely to derive from the Georgian dialectal
form tqlip-. At the same time the variant tqil- may be treated as a transformation of the protoform. The Svan correspondence is found in the derivative na-tqarb-el 'freckles' (cf. Gelenije 1974: 115). Is there any
connection with the root of*prtq-el- 'flat'?
GZ *tql-e$-: tql-iS- 'to hit strongly; to strike': Georg, tqles- : tqlis- 'to hit strongly; to strike': Megr. tqiras— : tqiris—. Verb stem connected by regular sound-symbolic relations with Georgian-Zan *txl-es- : txl-is-. The Megrelian variant tqiros- presupposes the existence of the former parallel vocalism a. The expected development of k after s does not take place here because of a back (pharyngeal) consonant in the stem. | | Fähnrich (1982: 36).
193



*tqoc
CK *tqoc- 'to throw; to strike (with a crack)': Georg, tqorc-n- 'to throw';*Megr. tqvac-, tkvac- 'to thunder'; Laz t(k)vac- 'to strike (with a crack); to shoot'; Svan tqc- 'to strike, hit'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian: cf. the action noun tqorceba(Abulaje 1973: 415). The Zan correspondences underwent a change ο > να (action nouns Megr. tqvacap-, Laz o-t(k)vac-u). The parallel existence of the Laz stem t(k)oc- 'to throw' somewhat complicates the comparison. | | Zan, Svan: Cikobava (1938:325).
CK *tqub— 'twins': Georg, tqub— 'twins'; Megr. tqup—, tqub—; Laz tqub—, t(k)ub^; Svan tqwib-.
The word is known in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973:415).The Zan forms with q may derive from a Georgian source. The sequence w/' in Svan has arisen through umlaut of u. In view of Georg, tquc- 'two joined fruits' one sometimes assumes a compound character of the stem (cf. Savaxisvili 1937: 398^00). || Georgian, Svan: Wardrop (1911: 618). Megrelian, Laz: Marr (1911-1914 VI: 420). Cf. also Deeters (1926:82).
CK *tqu(r)b- 'mushroom, fungus': Georg, tqurbla- 'tree fungus'; Svan tqub-ul- 'mushroom'. The word does not occur in Old Georgian texts. Word-final a in the modern Georgian form has an affixal nature. Its Svan equivalent contains a diminutive affix. A connection with the word in the preceding entry is not excluded (cf. USKJa: 185). | | Sardschweladse (1985:24).
U
CK *u—derivational affix of participles: Georg, u-; Megr. u—; Laz u-; Svan u-. Privative prefix widely productive in Old Georgian: cf. u-tqw'dumb', u-sret- 'inextinguishable', u-val- 'impassable', etc.It underlies also a number of later derivatives provided with additional suffixal elements: cf. Megr. u-skirat-u 'inextinguishable', Laz u-mck-u 'unbroken (of horse)', Svan u-dgar-a 'immortal'. 1 1 Cf. Topuria (1979: 77),Sardschweladse (1985:24).

*-u
GZ *-u derivational affix of pejoratives: Georg, -u derivational affix of pejoratives; Megr. -u. See *qur-u-.
GZ *u --- esi derivational coaffixes of elative (in adjectives): Georg. u --- es; Megr. u --- as; Laz u --- as. Word forming element widely used in Old Georgian (cemsa uadres. . . 'before me...' Jn. 5.7). The Georgian and Zan forms clearly correspond to each other: cf. *x-u-c}-es}-. Unlike in Georgian and Megrelian languages, in Laz the elative is preserved only vestigially in a few isolated lexemes: cf. u-nkil-as- 'junior', u-^gu-s- 'better, best'.
GZ *ube//a- 'bosom, lap': Georg, übe- 'bosom, lap'; Megr. (l)uba-, hba-; Laz uba-, oba- 'bosom, breast (of woman)'. Attested in Old Georgian (stavida ubesa mas navisasa... '(he) was gone down into the sides of a ship...' Jonah 1.5). The unusual phonetic shape of the word may point to its sound-symbolic nature. Word final e II a can hardly be suffixal. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 75). Laz: USKJa: 185.
CK *-un affix of causative verbs: Georg, -un; Megr. [-un]; Laz [-un]; Svan —un. Verb stems containing this affix are well known in Old Georgian (actunebs ersa... 'he deceiveth the people...' Jn. 7.12). The phonetic shape of the affix remains identical: cf. *kb-un-, *kd-un-, *CiX-un-. Possibly it stems from the combination of root final w with *-en II -in. | | Cf. Deeters (1930: 214); USKJa: 185-186.
GZ *ur£x- 'large intestine': Georg, urcx- 'large intestine'; Laz [incx-]. A problematic reconstruction. The word occurs in Old Georgian (Sar^velaje 1995: 210). According to S. Orbeliani it means 'back intestine', which indicates a semantic difference from *c\el-. The correspondence Georg, r ~ Laz n in a consonant cluster is not unusual. The Laz equivalent is found in the compound incxi-mencx- 'intestine, pluck'. || Sardzveladze(1991: 143).
CK *usx- 'sacrificial ox, bull': Georg, usx— Ox, bull-calf (fattened for slaughter'); Svan usxwa-, wisxw-, wicxw- 'sacrificial ox'. Well attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 433). In modern Georgian it survives in some dialects (ylonti 1984: 527). Its primary
195



*up
meaning is preserved in Svan. The form with initial \vi shows the effect of umlaut. The lexeme seems to reflect an archaic custom widespread in the ancient Near East. Probably borrowed from some continuant of PIE *η^8-οη- Ox, bull' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 1118). 1 1 Klimov (1988: 159-160; 1994: 63-68.
GZ*up- 'to possess, own': Georg. [(«)/?-] 'to possess, own'; Megr. [p-]; Laz [p-].
Verb stem found in Old Georgian in some derivatives: cf. upal— 'Lord, God', meupe— 'king'. In Megrelian the stem still functions in verbal wordforms: cf. a—p-u(n) 'he has him // her'. In Laz one can extract it only from the derivative *me-(u)p-e 'king'.
\\Cf.USKJa: 186.
CK *uy- 'yoke': Georg, uyel- 'yoke'; Megr. uyu-; Svan uywa, uywa, uywal.
For the Georgian-Zan level an intermediate form *uyel— must be posited to account for the correspondence between Georg, uyel- (cf. Old Georgian uyeli cemi tkbil ars... 'my burden is light...' Mt. 11.30) and Megr. uyu-, which contain a highly productive word-forming suffix. Cf. also the derivatives Georg, uyleul- ~ Megr. uyul- 'team of oxen'. Svan long may reflect loss of the word-initial "weak" consonant. The lexeme is usually considered an ancient borrowing from Indo-European (see Deeters 1957: 390; Charachidze 1986; 219; Klimov 1994: 70-71; Gamkrelidze-Ivanov 1995: 774): cf. Old Iranian *yuy(a)- 'yoke' (< PIE *iugo-m). The comparison with Semitic *yull of the same meaning is difficult to accept for phonetic reasons. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 113). Svan: Wardrop (1911: 634).
GZ *ucq— 'to know': Georg, ucq— 'to know'; Megr. orcq— 'to see'; Laz oc(k)- 'to look'. A somewhat problematic comparison. The stem is attested in Old Georgian (sen ucqi... 'see thou to that...' Mt. 27.4; action noun ucqeba—). Since the correspondence Georg, u ~ Zan o is unusual the identification is doubtful (Megrelian internal r may be a secondary insertion). The change cq > ck is characteristic of Laz dialects. | | Macavariani. (1953: 121-124). Cf, however, Cikobava (1938: 398).

GZ *pal- : pi- 'to hide, to bury': Georg, pal- : pi- 'to bury; to stick in'; Megr. pul- 'to hide; to bury'; Laz mpul- 'to hide'. Verb stem. It is widely represented in Old Georgian, where it meant 'to hide; to bury' (dapla vecxli... '(he) hid money' Mt. 25.18; saplav'grave', action noun daplva-). The Zan forms (action noun Megr. pulua-, Laz o-mpul-ii) reflect the full grade of the vocalism; expected became u adjacent to a labial. Laz m is a secondary augmentation. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 359), Deeters (1930: 125). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 330).
CK *pant- 'to throw about, disperse': Georg, pant- 'to throw about, disperse'; Megr. pant- (?); Svan pant—. Verb stem represented in the same shape in the language of Rustaveli (618.1). If the comparison of the Georgian and Zan material holds the vocalic shape of the Megrelian form requires explanation (interaction with the stem *pent- : pnt- }. For an irregular correspondence Georg.Zan p ~ Svan p cf. *pirtw-. The stem apparently underlies the derivative *petw- 'millet'. If Arm. p'andanel with the same meaning stems from Kartvelian (cf. Dzaukjan 1967: 99), it yields a new example of reflecting Kartvelian glottal t by a voiced consonant d (cf. *tnt-al-). | | Cf. USKJa: 187.
CK *par- : pr- 'to cover': Georg, par- 'to cover; to hide'; Megr. por'to cover'; Svan par- :pr-. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (rametu dahpare... 'because thou hast hid...' Mt. 11.25; action noun daparva—, parul— 'secret, covert'). However, Qeorg. par- 'shield' alongside Arm. pah (< park) must be treated as a borrowing from Middle Persian pähr 'guard' (Vogt 1969: 106). The Megrelian (action noun porua—) and Svan (action nouns li-1—pär—i, li—pr-en- ) forms clearly correspond to the Georgian stem. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Tseretheli (1959: 81). Svan: &SKJa: 187.
GZ *parpat- 'to flit, flutter': Georg.parpat- 'to flit, flutter'; Megr.porpot-. Verb stem. Despite the regular correspondence of the stem vocalism the proximity of its structure to a reduplicated type allows one to assume its onomatopoeic origin. Cf. also the sequence pr in the verb *pr-en- : pr-in- 'to fly'. 1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 36).
197



*parc,x
GZ *parc,x- 'harrow': Georg.parcx- 'harrow'; Megr. [porcx-]. A typical term of the stable agriculture. Although presently it is absent in Megrelian its phoneticaly regular Zan correspondence has been borrowed in some Georgian (Imer., Kax.) dialects, where its meaning is 'harrow' as well as 'rake'. In the Gurian dialect of Georgian the word means also 'branchy bough' (cf. yionti 1984: 547).
GZ *parx-un- 'to brag about, boast': Georg, parxun- 'to brag about, boast'; Megr. purxon-. Deverbative formation. Like in some other cases it is characterized by the word-forming affix *-un reflected in Zan in the respective Megrelian forms (cf. also *brag—un—, *pacx—un—, *pac\—un—). The phonetic correspondence in the root vocalism is consistent. This comparison presupposes a directly unattested base *perx-. | | Fähnrich (1982: 36).
GZ *papa- 'milk porridge': Georg.papa- 'milk porridge'; Megr. papir-; Laz papa-.
Whereas the word-final vowel is regularly rendered in Laz, the internal one does not show the correspondence expected in Zan languages. The latter difference points to the sound-symbolic character of the word if it is not borrowed from Georgian. In the Megrelian cognate secondary affixation has taken place. Cf. the PIE nursery lexeme *pap(p)a- 'food' (Pokorny 1959: 187).
GZ *papar- 'mane': Georg, papar- 'mane'; Megr. popor-. Whereas the correspondence in the stem vocalism is regular, the identity of word-final r in Megrelian requires explanation. In the analogous Svan papal 'mane' the final / cannot be original and may have arisen from r (cf. *pir-). Along with the vocalism of the Svan word this fact shows that the lexeme has been borrowed from Georgian. This seems to agree with a rather late introduction of the horse in Kartvelian culture. | | Bouda (1955: 200). Cf. Schmidt (1962: 135).
GZ *pac- 'fuss, trouble': Georg, pac- 'fuss, trouble'; Megr. poc-. In Georgian it functions on its own as well as being a part of a reduplicated formation with the vowel alternation paca-puc- of the same meaning. Cf. the derivative *pac-ur-. Cf. also the Megrelian action noun pocua—.
198



*pac-ur
GZ *pac-ur- 'to fuss': Georg, pacur- 'to fuss'; Megr.pucor-. Verbal formation. It is a derivative with an affix -ur from the simple base *pac-. The difference of the first-syllable vocalism in the Megrelian cognate (action noun pucorua-) as compared with Megr. poc- in the preceding entry is in all probability due to vowel metathesis. 1 1 Cf. USKJa: 188.
GZ *pacx—un— 'to scratch, claw': Georg, pacxun- 'to scratch, claw'; Megr. pucxon—, Laz pucxol-.
Verbal formation. Apparently a derivative with the affix —un based on a simple stem (cf. *brag-un-, *parx-un-), deriving also the noun *pocx'rake'. The material compared presupposes the existence of an underlying verb stem *pecx- which remains unattested directly. The suffix —ol is productive in Laz, as can be seen in a number of other cases. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 333). Georgian: Fähnrich (1982: 36).
GZ *pac1-un- 'to stroke': Georg, pacun- 'to stroke'; Megr. pucon-. Verbal formation unattested in Old Georgian. The stem (action noun Georg, pacun—, Megr. puconua—) has a historical word-forming suffix although the expected underlying verbal stem *pec:- remains unknown. | | Fähnrich (1984: 44).
CK *petk- : ptk- 'to break; to blow up': Georg, petk- 'to break; to blow up'; Megr. partk-al- 'to palpitate, tremble'; Lazpa(r)tk-al- 'to break; to palpitate'; Svanpitkw- : ptk- 'to break off, to erupt'. Verb stem. For Georgian it is attested in the language of Rustaveli (867.1). Its Zan cognates contain an inorganic r as well as a historical suffix -al. Svan knows a variant of the stem betk- (action noun li-ptk-e). The semantic unity of the forms is more or less preserved in all languages. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 328). Svan: Fähnrich (1984: 44).
CK *pen- : pin- 'to spread; to straw': Georg, pen- : pin- 'to spread'; Megr. pin-; Laz (m)pin-; Svan pin—.
Verb stem recorded in Old Georgian (dahpendes gzasa zeda '(they) strawed in the way' Mt. 21.8; action noun dapena—). The Georgian form reflects e ablaut grade. The stem-initial m of Laz is a secondary augmentation. The vowel lengthening in the Svan correspondence (action noun li-pJn-e) deserves attention. In the past a more complicated structure of the stem has been posited. Cf. Marr (1908: 4), Tseretheli (1959: 81).

*pertx- : prtx
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 104). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 329). Svan: Klimov (1960: 24).
CK *pertx- : prtx- 'to shake; to knock out'. Verb stem. In view of an early lexicalization of each ablaut grade, *pertx- and *prtx- are viewed below as two different (transitive and intransitive) verb stems. | | USKJa: 188.
CK *pertx- 'to shake': Georg, pertx- 'to shake; to knock out'; Megr. partx— 'to shake; to clean'; Laz patx— 'to shake; to knock out'; Svan patx-, ptx-.
Verb stem. Contrary to *prtx- it is consolidated in all Kartvelian languages mainly in its transitive meaning. In Laz (cf. action noun o-patx-u alongside Megr. partxua-) r is lost. The stem is clearly connected by the rules of Kartvelian sound symbolism with *[berdy-]: brayana *pertq- : prtq-. Cf. also *bertq-.
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 334). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 327-328). Svan: (cf. Penrixi-Sar^velase 1990: 317).
GZ(?) *pesw- 'root': Georg.pesv- 'root'; Megr. pos(ve)-; Lazposo-, A tentative comparison. The word occurs also in Old Georgian (seexo ... pesusa samoslisa... '(he) touched ... the tails of clothes' Sin. mr. 227.11). Cf. the Georgian dialectal forms Gwc.persv- and Adj.peso-. The Zan evidence allows to posit a primary vocalism a (cf. Macavariani 1958: 265). The Laz equivalent occurs rarely and shows a secondary change we > o.
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraya (1912: 35). Laz: USKJa: 187.
CK *petw- 'millet': Georg, petv- 'millet'; Megr. pat-; Laz pat-; Svan petw, pätw.
The word is well known from Old Georgian texts (keri da petwi... 'barley and millet...' Is. 28.25). Sometimes one considers it to be derived from the verb stem *pant-. Svan knows a derivative formation petw-ra 'millet flour'. Millet is one of the most ancient attributes of Kartvelian agriculture. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: V). Laz: Marr (1910: 193). Svan: Wardrop (1911:615).

*pekw- : pkw
CK *pekw- : pkw- 'to grind': Georg.pkv- 'to grind'; Megr. k(v)-, Laz mk(v)-; Svan [pek-].
Verb stem occurring in Old Georgian (pkviden pkvilsa... '(they) were grinding flour...' Lk. 18.35; action nounpkva-). In the Zan forms (cf. action noun Megr. kuala-, Laz o-mk-u) a simplification of the consonant cluster usually takes place although the Laz one may have an inorganic m. In Svan the stem may be discerned in the substantive pek- 'flour'. A Georgian-Zan derivative *pkw-il- may be posited. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 31). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 305). Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 293).
CK *peS- : pS- 'to dehisce (noisily, with a crack)': Georg, [ps-] 'to husk'; Megr. pask—, pesk—\ 'to dehisce, burst (noisily)'; Svanpesk—: psg'to become untied; to open (noisily)'. Onomatopoeic verb stem attested in the modern Georgian action noun (gamo)ps-vn-a 'to husk' (at present it means also 'to crumble'). Cf. also the Megrelian derivatives peskvere- 'swelled, plump' and peskvinia'popcorn', where the stem vocalism is adjusted in conformity with a word-forming model. The Svan action nouns are li-pesg 'to become untied' and li-psg~e 'to open (a vessel noisily)'. | | Megrelian, Svan: Topuria (cf. 1979: 10). For Georgian cf. Fähnrich (1980: 73).
CK *pe§w- 'to feel, touch; to caress': Georg, pesv- 'to feel, touch'; Svan päsgw-, paskw-\O smooth, caress'. Occurs in Old Georgian: epesuebodes vitarca brmani kedelsa' 'grope for the wall like the blind' Is. 59.10; action noun pesueba-, puesueba(Abulase 1973: 445). For Svan cf. action noun li-pasgw-e (Upper Bal), li-pasfcw-e (Lent.), where stem-internal vowel underwent labial umlaut effect. These forms show an exception from Gamkrelidze's law (cf. *mswild—, *swd—, *swid—\ | | Suxisvili (1990: 84).
CK *pirtw- 'lungs': Georg, piltv-, pirtv- 'lungs'; Megr. pirtv-\ Laz purpu—; Svan perstwa—, pereswda— (?).
In some Georgian dialects as well as in Old Georgian the lexeme occurs in the shape ofpirtw- (seceul iqo pirtuad '(it) reached the lungs' Kartl. ex. I 202. 16-17). In Megrelian a simplified variant pizv- is more usual. The Laz form seems to have been contaminated with some other
201



*pit- : pt
one. The specific shape of the Svan word, especially its initial P., is difficult to explain. Georgian / must be treated as a secondary substitution. The lexeme is related to the verb stem *prtw-in-. Other reconstructions (cf. Tseretheli 1959: 94) are uncertain. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895: 110). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 67). Svan: Wardrop (1911: 613).'
CK(?) *pit- : pt- 'to make a hole': Georg, pit- 'to make a hole'; Svan pit- : pt-.
Possibly a Common Kartvelian verb stem (if the Svan form is not borrowed from Georgian). Cf. the undoubtedly Common Kartvelian verb stem *qwer- : qwr- with the same meaning. The Svan analogy distinguishes two ablaut grades: action noun li-pt-e alongside pile 'he makes a hole'). | | Macavariani (1965: 25).
GZ *pidx- 'dry brushwood': Georg.picx- 'hot-tempered'; Megr. [picx-] 'dry brushwood'; Laz picx-. The Georgian word underlies an adjective picx—el— of the same meaning and a verb gan-picx-eb-α- 'to become hardened' attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abula3e 1973: 72 and 446). The meaning of the Georgian lexeme seems to be the result of a metaphoric transfer of the original one preserved in Zan languages. The expected Megrelian equivalent is found in West-Georgian dialects as a Zan borrowing. Cf. also the Megrelian form percx- 'dry brushwood' and action noun picxolua- 'to break brushwood'. The originality of the Laz cognate remains somewhat doubtful since it is recorded only in Abxazia. | | Klimov (1988: 20-21).
CK *plet- : plit- : pit- 'to wear out': Georgianplet- \plit- 'to wear out'; Megr. pat-; Laz plat- 'to get worn out; to tear to pieces; Svan pet- : pt'to scutch wool'. Verb stem. Cf. also the Georgian participle da-plet-il- 'worn out' and a parallel dialectal (Xevs.) aoristic word-form dapita 'he wore out, he tore out'. For Megrelian cf. the action noimpatua-. In Laz (dialect of Xopa) an action noun o-plat-u has been recorded. One believes the Svan cognate (cf. a-pt-i 'he scutched wool') also to be simplified.
1 1 Georgian, Svan: Gamqrelije-Macavariani (1965: 200). Laz: Klimov (1993: 136).
202



*polo
GZ *polo- 'hoof: Georg, polo-, pol- 'large hoof; Megr. polo- 'hoof, foot'; Laz (m)polo-, mpulo- 'calf of leg, lower part of leg'. Its unusual vocalism as well as its meaning, referring to a specific kind of animal, speak against the native character of the word. Georgian (Gur.) polo- 'big foot, ugly foot' may be a Zan loanword. Cf. also the Megrelian derivative na-pol-e- 'hoof tracks'. Svan pol 'hoof can, in view of its final /, not be ancient and must derive from Georgian. The Kartvelian material stems apparently from continuants of PIE *polo- 'big toe, thumb' (cf. Klimov 1994: 143-144). | | Fähnrich (1975: 338).
GZ *pocx- 'rake': Georg, pocx- 'rake'; Megr. bucx-; Laz bucx-. The term is an important element of the Kartvelian agricultural vocabulary missing in Svan. It must be treated as a derivative from the verb stem (cf. *pacx—un—). The Zan form shows a change o > u adjacent to the labial consonant and shows, as in some other cases, a kind of the consonantal dissimilation. Arm. p Oc 'x with the same meaning seems to be borrowed from Georgian (cf. Marr 1910: 133; Acaryan 1979: 521). | | Cikobava (1938: 164).
GZ *pocx- 'to rake': Georg, pocx- 'to rake'; Megr. bucx-, Laz bucx-, bumcx-.
The verb stem attested in the poem of Rustaveli (1623.4). Its phonetic history in the languages is analogous to its nominal counterpart treated in the preceding entry. The stempacx- pcx-, recorded in Svan is unlikely to be original. According to K. Dondua (unpublished manuscript) it must be borrowed from Georgian. For Arm. p Oc 'xel cf. the preceding entry. | | Cikobava (1938: 255-256).
GZ *pr-en- : pr-in- 'to fly': Georg.pren- :prin- 'to fly'; Megr.purin-; Laz purtin-.
Verb stem well represented in Old Georgian (martueni igi gamoprindes... 'the nestlings flew out' Sin. mr. 34.19). The Zan u breaks up the consonantal sequence in stem-initial position. Its timbre is conditioned by the proximity of the labial. The Laz correspondence (cf. action noun purt—in— alongside Megr. purinua—) seems to be contaminated with some other verb stem. The word contains an onomatopoeic sequence pr reiterated in other languages of the Caucasus and beyond it (cf. Abx.par-, Sem. prr, etc.). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 106). Laz: USKJa: 190.
203



*prec— : pric
GZ *prec- : pric- 'to tear, rend': Georg, prec- : pric- 'to tear, rend'; Megr. buric-; Laz brie-, bruc-.
Verb stem attested in Old Georgian texts: cf. the action noun gan-prec-a- (Abula^e 1973: 72). It has a sound-symbolic shape. There is a parallel variant of the stem *pxrec- : pxric-, The initial consonant in the Zan forms (action noun Megr. buricua—, Laz o—bric—u, o—bruc—u) results from a process of dissimilative voicing. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 225).
GZ *prec-il- 'torn': Georg, precil- 'torn'; Laz bracel-. Unattested in Old Georgian. It is a past participle in —il based on the verb stem *prec- : pric- 'to tear, rend'. The Laz form recorded in Sarpi is adapted to adjectives ending in -el. | | Cf.Gamqrelise-Macavariani (1965: 192).
CK *prtx- 'to tremble; to rouse oneself: Georg, prtx- 'to rouse oneself; to take care'; Megr. (p)ntx-, tx-; Lazputx- 'to fly'; Svan pa(r)tx-9n- 'to tremble'. Verb stem well known from Old Georgian texts (ac ganiprtxve... 'rouse thyself from now on...' Bal. 28.30; prtx-il- 'careful'). Unlike *pertx- it has an intransitive meaning. The Zan stem (cf. action noun Megr. ntxeba-, Laz o-putx(in)-u) shows a trend toward simplification. The Svan cognate (action noun li-pd(r)tx-dn-i) contains a suffixal element (cf. here also a voiced variant of the stem hardy— an—). Cf. SSKJa: 190.
GZ *prtw-in— 'to snort': Georg, prtvin— 'to snort'; Megr. purtin— 'to spit': Laz purtin- 'to snort'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (Sar^velase 1995: 222). Its simple stem may be discerned in the nominal derivative *pirtw—. The original sonant r is regularly reflected in all languages. The Megrelian form (action noun purtinua-) underwent a semantic shift. Laz o-futin-u 'to neigh (of horses)' seems to be a transformation of this stem. | | Cf. USKJa: 190-191
CK *prcxa- 'nail, claw': Georg, prcx-il- 'nail'; Megr. bircxa- 'nail, claw'; Laz bu(r)cxa—; Svan cxa. The continuant form in Old Georgian is widely attested in the shape of prcxil- (prcxenen prcxilita 'they scratch with claws' Lev. 11.4).
204



*prcx-en
Among Georgian dialectal variants mention may be made of Gur. prcxil-, Xevs., Tus. pircxil-, Psav. brcxil- (cf. yionti 1984: 544), extended by the later word-forming suffix -//. The age of the final a is indicated by Zan and Svan lexemes. While in the Georgian form an unclear change c > c is attested, in its Zan cognates we see a typical dissimilation of the word-initial voiceless consonant (sometimes one assumes here a reverse process). The onset of the Svan correspondence is simplified. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 62).Svan: OSKJa: 191.
CK *prcx—en— 'to scratch oneself: Georg, prcxen— 'to scratch oneself; Megr. pucxon-, pucxol- 'to scrape'; Laz pucxol- 'to scrape, scratch'; Svan cxen- 'to comb'. A verbal formation attested in Old Georgian texts (see the precding entry). One considers it a derivative from the noun *prcxa-. The Zan cognates (action noun Megr. pucxonua-, Laz o-pucxol-u) contain a secondary affixation. The semantic unity of the data needs no commentary.
\\Cf.£SKJa: 191.
GZ *prd-wn- 'to peel': Georg, prckvn- 'to peel, to clean'; Megr. purcon—.
A verbal formation. The Georgian form differs by a secondary k. The Megrelian cognate as well as based on its root *purcj-el- 'husk, foliage' (that is also found in Laz) indicate its absence in the original shape of the stem. Megr. purckonua- of the same meaning seems to be a contamination of the native stem and the Georgian form. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Gudava (1979: 86).Some others compare the Georgian stem directly with Megr. purckonua-. Cf. Fähnrich (1982: 36).
CK *ps- 'to urinate': Georg.ps- 'to urinate'; Megr. (p)s-; Laz/«-; Svan
MV.erb stem of an evidently onomatopoeic nature. In the Sen.dialect of Megrelian it is simplified. The Svan match, without the initial p, can be seen in the suffixal formation sen- (action noun li-sen-e). The stem occurs in forms of the aoristic tense series. Cf. its derivative *ps—am— : ps-m- with the thematic suffix. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 208).Laz:Cikobava (1938: 329). Svan: USKJa: 191.

*ps-am- : ps-m
GZ *ps-am- : ps-m- 'to urinate': Georg, psam- : psm- 'to urinate'; Megr. (p)sdm-, bsam-\ Laz psim-.
Verbal formation derived from *ps- by suffixation of the thematic *-am : -m, found in the word forms of the presentic tense series. It is attested in Old Georgian: action noun psma- (Abulase 1973: 448). Unlike Georgian, the Zan forms (cf. action noun Megr. (p)ssma—, Laz o-psim-u) reflect only a zero grade. | | Cf. USKJa: 191.
CK *pu- 'to inflate; to rise': Georg. pu(v)- 'to rise (about the dough)'; Megr. pu- 'to boil'; Lazpu-; Svanpw-.
Verb stem documented in Old Georgian by a number of derivatives: cf. puar- 'dough' (Abulaje 1973: 448). The Megrelian action noun is puala—. In Georgian as well as in Svan the change u > w is conditioned by position: cf. Svan action noun li-pw-e alongside pul- 'whiff'. The semantic unity and the onomatopoeic origin of the data are obvious. | | Cf.ÜSKJa: 192.
CK *pu-wn- 'to boil': Georg, puvn- 'to leaven (dough)'; Megr. pun- 'to boil'; Lazpun-, Svan pw-in-, pii-jn-.
Verb stem derived from */>«-. It is well attested in Old Georgian (vidremdis ganapuvna qoveli 'till the whole was leavened' Mt. 13.33; cf. the action noun ganpuvneba-). One assumes a semantic shift in the Georgian stem. Cf. Svan action noun li-pwin-e. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 664). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 330). Svan: USKJa: 192.
CK *pur- 'cow': Georg, pur- 'cow, she-buffalo'; Megr. pu$-\ Lazpug'cow'; Svan pur, pirw (pi. stem pur-).
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian texts (purman matman ara moagdo... 'their cow did not throw out...' Job 21.10). Cf.pur-irem- 'doe, female deer' where irem- means 'deer'. Its continuants have a regular phonetic shape. The original semantics is better preserved in Laz and Svan. Cf. Cikobava (1938: 78). | | Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 29). Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 72).

206



*purc1-el
Verb stem of an onomatopoeic character (cf. Georg, curcul— with the same semantics). The correspondence of Georg, c ~ Zan ck in the position after r is well known in a number of other cases: see *arcw-, *qlec- and others (cf. Gamqre^e 1959: 76). The stems are extended by wordforming affixes characteristic of onomatopoeic formations. ||Cikobava(1938:331).
GZ *purci-el- 'foliage, husk': Georg, purcel- 'foliage'; Megr. purca'chaff, husk'; Lazpurca-. Well known from Old Georgian texts (purceli gamobutkoin... 'putteth forth leaves...' Mt. 24.32). Derived from a simple stem of the verb *prc{—wn— by adding the word-forming affix: cf. *wrci—el—; *c\it-el—, *c\rp-el-, and others. In Laz the word has a derivative purcwnale(Xopa), porcwnale— (Atina) 'a kind of weed' with an unclear second component. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Lomtati3e (1984: 34). Laz: Klimov (1985: 160).
GZ *puturo- 'rotten (about fruit, trees), rot': Georg, puturo- 'rotten (about trees, fruit); rot, mouldering'; Megr. [putur-]; Lazpuntura- 'rotten, empty (about nuts)'. In Megrelian the lexeme is identified in a denominative verb puturua'to rot' (cf. past participle puturel- 'rotten, worm-eaten'). For the correlation Georg, o ~ Zan α in word-final position cf. *butko-. The Laz cognate contains an inorganic augmentation n. The unusual vocalic shape of the lexeme makes one doubt its Kartvelian origin. Cf. in this connection PIE *pu—tro— 'rotten, rotten stuff', where —tro is a well-known derivatory element (less probable seems a connection of the word with Lat. putris). | | Georgian, Laz: Zyenti (1953: 94). Megrelian: Klimov (1994: 146-147).
GZ *pupul- 'abscess': Georg, pupula- 'pimple, abscess'; Megr.pupul-; Laz pupu(r)—, pupul-.
The word contains a reduplication of the verb stem *pu-. According to Penrixi-Sar|vela3e (1990: 323) the root is *pul-. The Georgian continuant is extended by the affix -a. Its Megrelian cognate occurs only rarely. Similar lexemes are also attested beyond the area of Kartvelian languages. Cf. Lat. pupula 'pimple', Lit. pupule 'full bud' alongside PIE *pu-p- (Pokorny 1959: 848). 1 1 ESKJa: 193.
207



*puc,
GZ *puc!~ 'to swear': Georg, puc—, pic- 'to swear'; Megr. puc—; Laz pu(r)c-.
A verb stem still represented in Old Georgian with vowel u (epuca mas... 'he swore an oath to him...' Gen. 25.33; action nounpucva-). In modern Georgian it is replaced by the stem with i (cf. the following entry). The Laz form may have an augmentation r (action noun o-pu(r)c-u alongside Megr. puc-apa-). If Svanps- of the same meaning (action noun li-ps-i) is not related, it may have been borrowed from Georgian. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 110). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 331-332).
GZ *puc!~ Oath': Georg.pic- Oath'; Megr. puc-. The lexeme is widely represented in Old Georgian texts: misce ... pici seni... 'perform ... thine oaths...' Mt. 5.33. It seems that the Georgian form underwent an old process of umlautization. For the correlation of the noun and verb stems in Old Georgian cf. picit apuca... '(he) had straightly sworn...' Ex. 13.19. 1 1 Cf. iSKJa: 193.
GZ *pkw-il- 'ground, flour': Georg, pkvil- 'flour'; Megr. k(v)ir-\ Laz (m)ki(r)-, (m)kver-, (m)pkver-,
Deverbative formation. It is a historical past participle in -il derived from the verbal stem *[pekw-] : pkw- 'to grind'. The stem is amply attested in Old Georgian (sehrto igipkvilsa... '(she) added it into flour...' Mt. 13.33). Cf. also Georgian dialectal variants kvil-, kpil-, kbil- (yionti 1984: 564, 581). In the Zan forms the original consonant cluster is reduced. Besides the regular reflex of the participial suffix a later form in -er is also available here. The similar Svan pek- shows a different wordformation type. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 31). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 305).
GZ *pknar- : pknr- 'to yawn': Georg, mtknar- 'to yawn'; Megr. far-, kil-; Laz nkor-, mkor-.
In Old Georgian the verb stem occurs in the shape ofphiar- (Abulase 1973: 450). The modern Kartvelian forms have endured a complicated phonetic history, the details of which require further clarification. At any rate the insertion of an inorganic t into the Georgian form and the general
208



*psala
simplification of its Zan correspondences are obvious. For the Zan languages cf. the action nouns Megr. kir-on- and Laz o-mkor-u. The protoform is reconstructed in Sar^ve^e (1970: 235). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 339-340).
GZ *p$ala- 'hop': Georgian psala- 'hop'; Laz pskvela- 'young aldertree'. The word seems to be absent in Megrelian. Ancient s is regularly reflected in the Laz form, where the sequence ve presupposes former o. Therefore the conditions for the realization of Gamkrelidze's law did not exist here. Since a different Georgian-Zan designation of alder-tree is reconstructed (see *txmel-) the meaning of 'hop' should be given preference. : 194.
CK(?) *pSw-en- : pSw-n- 'to crumble, make friable': Georg, psven- : psvn- 'to crumble'; Svan pursgwin- 'to crumble, make friable'. Apparently a Common Kartvelian verb stem. Its Old Georgian continuant may be extracted from the form of the past participle na-psuen- 'crumb'. In modern Georgian there is also its suffixal derivative psvn—et— with the same meaning. A Zan correspondence apparently is lacking, r of the Svan cognate must have been inserted at a later time. The sequence sg of the intervocalic consonant cluster (instead of the expected sg) needs an explanation. In this connection the question arises of the relation of this stem to Common Kartvelian *pes- : ps-.
1 1 Klimov (1985: 174).
CK *px- 'to be clear (of weather)': Georg, [px-] 'to be clear (of weather)'; Laz [px-]', Svan [px-]. A verb stem reflected in all Kartvelian languages only in its derivatives. Cf. *me-px-e 'clear sky, fine weather' as well as Georg. za-px-ul- and Svan lu-px-w 'summer'. Precisely the meaning of *me-px-e helps us to establish a tentative meaning of this stem. | | Cf.Caraya (1912: 35-36).
CK *pxa- 'frame, small bone': Georg, pxa- 'awn of cereals; fishbone'; Megr. xa- 'cartilage of snake; scales offish'; Laz mxa- 'fishbone'; Svan pxa— 'fishbone'; small snake'.
209



*px-ek- : px-ik
The continuant of the protoform is known with the meaning of 'awn of cereals' in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 450). In both Zan languages the word-initial consonant sequence underwent some transformation. Cf. analogous changes in *kupxa- and *lukupxa-. As in other substantives the word-final vowel is regularly identical in all languages. | | USKJa: 194.
GZ *px-ek-: px-ik- 'to scrape': Georg.pxek-:pxik- 'to scrape'; Megr. [xa£-]; Laz [xa/r-]; Svanpxic- (?). The stem may be treated as a derivative from *pxa- with affixation of *-ek. It occurs also in Old Georgian (mopxekon signit '(they) scrape from the inside' Lev. 14.41: action noun ganpxeka—, mopxeka—). While the onset of the Zan form is changed regularly, it ends in a secondary affix —ar. cf. the Megrelian action noun xakarua— (alongside tqabarua— 'to strip the skin off', svabarua- 'to bark a lime-tree'). The age of the Svan stem remains unclear (cf.Svan pxik 'bald patch'). | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 419).
CK(?) *pxot- 'to scratch, to peck': Georg.pxot- 'to scratch'; Svanpxat'to pick out'. Verb stem apparently unattested in Old Georgian. There is a dialectal variant pxoc- in modern Georgian (ylonti 1984: 557). In Svan the stem is extended by an affix (action noun li-pxt-sn-e). | | Fähnrich (1985: 28).
GZ *pxrec- : pxric- 'to tear (roughly)': Georg, pxrec- : pxric- 'to tear (roughly), rip'; Megr. xiric-. A verb stem showing sound symbolism. It has a simpler parallel variant *prec- : pric—, which is reflected in Old Georgian: action noun ganpreca(Abula3e 1973:72). There is also its modern Georgian variation with / replacing r (cf. action nounpxleca-). The Megrelian correspondence (action noun xiricua—) underwent a simplification of the initial consonant cluster. | | Fähnrich (1982: 36).
GZ *pxuc!- 'to pucker': Georg.pxuc- 'to pucker; to gather'; Megr. xuc-. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. Action nouns Georg, pxucva-; Megr. xucua-. The word-initial consonant sequence of the Megrelian form underwent simplification. The correspondence of the stem affricates in both languages is regular. | | Fähnrich (1982:36).

κ
GZ *-k- pronominal stem: Georg, [-k-]; Megr. [-k-]; Laz [-k-]. Pronominal stem. In modern languages it can be discerned only in its historical derivatives (cf.*a-k and *i-k). If the stem is to be genetically identified with Svan -g-, which is found in the adverbs ameg 'here' and demeg 'nowhere', then it can date back to the Common Kartvelian stage in the shape of *-g-. | | USKJa: 194.
CK(?) *kab- : kb- 'to know': Georg, ceb- : cb- 'to know; to expect'; Svan kab- : kb-.
Despite some divergence in meaning apparently a Common Kartvelian verb stem. The base is widely used in Old Georgian: cf. action noun cebna— (Sar^ve^e 1995: 252). In modern Georgian the derivatives cb-ier- 'insidious' and uceb- 'sudden' are found. For the phoneticcorrespondence between Svan back occlusive and Georgian-Zan affricate see *brg-, *kad- : kd-, *kreml-, etc.For non-functional alternation a II e cf. *barc\-, *kreb- : krb-, *recl- : rci-, *cer- : cr-, and many others. There is also a common adverbial formation Georg, u-cb-ad 'not knowing, unexpectedly' and Svan u-kb-ad 'secretly, against one's will'. Cf. also its ancient derivative *kb-un—. | | Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 297). Seealso Marr (1914: 45^6).
CK *kad- : kd- 'to make mistake, err': Georg, cet- : cd- 'to make mistake, err'; Megr. cilat- : cilit- : cirt-, Laz culet- : cit- 'to get rid; to escape'; Svan kad— : kd— 'to make mistake, err'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (tkuen priad hsctebit 'ye do greatly err' Mk. 12.27; action noun cioma-). For other examples of the correspondence Svan k ~ Georgian-Zan c, and instability of the vocalism a // e in Kartvelian material see *kab— : kb-. The Zan forms (action noun Megr. cilata-, Laz o-culet-in-u) show an insertion of / of later origin through the intermediate step cirt—. Cf. also derivative *kd—un—. For Svan cf. action noun li—kad. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 63). Svan, Laz: Marr (1914: 45). Cf. Cikobava (1938: 374).
GZ *katam- 'hen': Georg, katam- 'hen'; Megr. kotom-\ Laz kotume-, korme-.
211



*kam- : km
Well documented in Old Georgian (katamman seikribnis martueni 'a hen gathereth her chickens' Mt. 23.37). Laz cognates show an inorganic e and shift of the expected ο into u next to a labial consonant. The sequence rm emerged here from tm. Svan katal 'hen' originates from the simplified form of the word and contains an affixal -(a)l. According to common knowledge this kind of fowl did not exist at the Common Kartvelian stage in the Caucasus. Therefore the Svan word must be a loanword from a Georgian source. The similarity of some other Caucasian designations of the hen points to the cultural character of the word. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 70). Laz: Marr (1936: 63).
CK(?) *kam- : km- 'to do': Georg, kam- : km- 'to do, make'; Megr. kirn-; Laz hum-, kom-, kip-; Svan cwem- : cwm-C?).
The verb stem is widely represented in Old Georgian, where some derivatives are also known (rasa ihnan... 'what they do...' Lk. 23.34; action noun (se)kmna-). The ablaut alternation is still typical of some Georgian dialects nowadays. While Laz ο reflects full grade, the zero grade is here attested in forms with /. The phonetic history of the Svan correspondence remains unclear. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 87). Laz: Munkacsi (1901: 620).
GZ *kan— : kn— 'to wave, rock, swing': Georg, kan— : kn— 'to wave, rock, swing'; Megr. kirin- 'to wave' (?); Laz nkin-. A verbal stem attested in Old Georgian: cf. action noun kneva(Abulase 1973: 455). In the Zan languages the stem must have been contaminated with the designation of the horn (cf. Megrelian action noun rkia(la-) 'to raise sth. against sby.'). The Laz form (action noun mo-nkin-u) clearly shows the zero ablaut grade. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Marr (1910: 197). Megrelian: Cikobava (1938: 336).
GZ *kar- : kr- 'to disperse; to disappear': Georg, her- : kr- 'to disperse; to extinguish, get exstinguished'; Megr. (n)kir— 'to disappear (suddenly)'. The continuant of the stem is widely known in Old Georgian texts (ukuetu marili gankardes... 'if the salt shall lose savour...' Mt. 5.13; action nouns gankarveba- 'to disperse, get dispersed', krola- // nkreva'to blow (about wind)'; cf. kar- 'wind'). In the Georgian forms both ablaut grades are reflected. The emergence of an inorganic n may be due to the last consonant of the preverb gan- (> modern Georgian ga-). In its
212



*kart(w)
Megrelian counterpart only the zero grade is reflected (cf. action noun gon—kir—αρα—).
| | Cf. Topuria (1979: 35).
GZ *kart(w)- simple base underlying Georgian-Zan derivatives *kartw-el- and *kart-ul-. Similar Svan Kart- 'Tbilisi' seems to be a later acquisition.
GGZ *kartw-el- 'Georgian': Georg, kartvel- 'Georgian'; Megr. kortu-; Laz kortu-·.
The ethnonym is attested in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 451). Whereas in Megrelian the word is commonly used, in Laz it occurs only rarely (cf. arti - kortu, mazura - margali... One is Georgian, the other is Megrelian...' Cl II 76.6). The forms show the well-known correspondence Georg, -el ~ Zan -u. Together with *m-egr-el- 'Megrelian' the word indicates the presence of an important ethnic division as early as in the period of the Georgian-Zan unity. | | USKJa: 196.
GGZ *kart-ul- 'Georgian (of non-human objects)': Georg, kartul'Georgian (of non-human objects)'; Megr. kortul-; Laz kortul- 'Georgian (kind of plum)'. The word is found in Old Georgian texts (damarxul ars enaj kartuli 'the Georgian language is buried' Sin. mr. 283.3). Contrary to *kartw-elit is not used with reference to people. In Laz a semantic narrowing of the lexeme has occurred. 1 1 USKJa: 196.
GGZ *kacw- 'sea buckthorn': Georg, kacv- 'sea buckthorn'; Megr. kuc-. The word occurs in medieval Georgian written sources (cf. Rustaveli 689.2, 709.2). The final consonant of its Megrelian counterpart is lost. From the latter are formed derivatives kucuc- 'prickle' and kucucam'prickly' (epithet of hedgehog). For the vocalic correlation of these forms see Gudava (1960: 119 sqq.). ||Caraia(1918:369).
GCK *kb-un- 'to tempt': Georg, cbun- 'to tempt'; Svan kbun-. A stem widely attested in Old Georgian: action noun cbuneba(Abulaje 1973: 514). It is based on the simple verb stem *kab- : kb- and contains the word-forming affix —un. The Svan action noun is li-kbun-e.
213



*kd-un
CK *kd-un- 'to seduce': Georg, cdun- 'to seduce; to mislead'; Svan kdun-, The verb stem is represented in Old Georgian texts: cf. the action noun cduneba- (Abulase 1973: 516). It is a derivative of the simple base *kad- : kd- formed by addition of the affix -un. The Svan action noun li—kdun—e.
GZ *ked- 'back of head; neck': Georgian ked- 'back of head, spine'; Megr. kind—ir— 'back of head'. Attested in Old Georgian: damoikidos ... kedsa '(it) were hanged about his neck' Mt. 18.6. For its derivatives see Sar|vela3e (1995: 223). In the Megrelian word a suffixal element and an inorganic phonetic augmentation n are present. The change e > i in the position before n is regular. A question arises on the relation of these forms to Georg, (tavis) kindrva 'to hang (one's head)'. 1 1 Topuria (IKE I:76).
CK *ket- : kt- 'to turn': Megr. rt- 'to turn, turn into'; Laz kt- 'to turn; to wave'; Svan kesd— : ksd— 'to turn'. A verb stem with no certain cognate in Georgian. Possibly it coincided with the reflex of the etymological *kec^- : kc{-. The stem illustrates a correspondence Georg.-Zan t ~ Svan sd. The transformation kt > rt is regular for Megrelian. | | ESKJa: 200.
CK *ke(n)k- 'to pick, dig into': Georg, kek- 'to pick, dig into'; Laz kank-\ Svan kink- 'to dig into, stir'. A verb stem found in medieval Georgian texts. The Zan and Svan forms are extended by an inorganic « (action noun Laz o—kank—u, Svan li-kink-e). The semantic unity of the cognates is self-evident. The Laz stem has an additional meaning 'to scutch (flax)'. | | ESKJa: 197.
CK *kel- 'to recover one's breath': Georg, kel- 'to recover one's breath'; Megr. (n)kal-\ Svan käl- 'to sigh, breathe heavily, pant'. For Georgian it is attested in the language of Rustaveli (605.4). In the Megrelian cognate a secondary insertion of n may have taken place (action noun (n)kalua-, kal- 'breathing'). Its relation to Megr. kakal'whiff, breathing' remains unclear. The Svan action noun is li—kal—i. | | Georgian, Zan: Zyenti (1960: 56). Megrelian: ESKJa: 197. Svan: Gagua (IKE XVII, 1970: 130).
214



*kertl
GZ *kertl- 'dandruff': Georg, kertl- 'dandruff'; Laz ka(r)to-. Unattested in Old Georgian. Cf. the Georgian dialectal (Imer.) metathesized form keter- (yionti 1984: 566). Word-final ο of the Laz equivalent seems to be a later development. | | Kutelia (1989: 23).
CK *kercil- 'scale': Georg, kercl- 'scale'; Svan karc. Not found in Old Georgian texts (see the following entry). In the modern language a dialectal (Imer.) kerkl— (cf. yionti 1984: 566) is noteworthy. The Zan equivalent seems to be absent: Megr. kerca-, kirca- and Laz kercela-, cela- with the same meaning are Georgian borrowings. The Svan form must be treated as a regular correspondence of the Georgian lexeme.
GZ *kec(u>- 'rind, scale': Georg, kec- 'fish scale'; Megr. kacu-. A tentative reconstruction for the Georgian-Zan level. The word is attested in Old Georgian: ver moiyon era keci bolojsa misisaj '(they) cannot pierce (one piece of) skin of its tail' Job 40.26; u-kec-o 'scaleless' (Sar^welase 1995: 214). The Modern Georgian word also means 'itch'. For the reconstruction of its coda cf. *kutx(u)-, *nek(u)-, *ret(u)-, *Yom(u)-. The relation to *kercll- needs elucidation.
GZ(?) *kec,- : kc!- 'to turn, convert': Georg, kec- : kc- 'to convert, turn'; Megr. ck(v)- 'to convert'. Problematic comparison for the Georgian-Zan level. The stem is well attested in Old Georgian texts (ara tu ikcet... 'except ye be converted...' Mt. 18.3). In Georgian it may have been contaminated with *ket- : kt-. The Megrelian form has an unclear v at the end: mapat ockvans ina cices 'he converts a petty into king' (Berime 1920: 166); action noun ckvapa-, ckwnala—. The comparison is possible on the assumption that a metathesis of consonants has led in Megrelian to the emergence of the characteristic cluster. 1 1 USKJa: 200.
GZ *kwa- 'stone': Georg, kva- 'stone'; Megr. kua- (plural form kual-); Laz (n)kva- (plural form - (n)kval-), mkva-.
The lexeme is amply attested in Old Georgian (ara dastes kvaj kvasa zeda 'there shall not be left one stone upon another' Mt. 24.2; some derivatives are also found here). The identity of α in all languages points to its historically word-final position and therefore to a later development of /,
215



*kwab
which occurs in Zan plural forms. In the Megrelian word we are faced with vocalization of the sonant w (cf. *arwa-, *swe-, *m-sw-e-, and others). 1 1 Marr (1936: 331).
CK(?) *kwab— 'cave': Georg, kvab— 'cave; boiler'; Megr. kvib- 'cave, hollow; small cauldron'; Svan kvvab, kwaba 'cave'. The word is well known from Old Georgian (daemkwidra kuabsa sina... 'he settled down in a cave...' Gen. 19.30). Cf. also Georgian dialectal variants kob- and hub- (yionti 1984: 577). The Megrelian cognate is poorly attested. For the correspondence of Georgian and Zan words in their vocalic frame cf. *ancj-, *at-, and some other entries. There are some doubts about the native character of the Svan word. 1 1 USKJa: 197.
CK *kwe 'below, down': Georg, kve 'down, under'; Svan [&vv-]. The adverb is attested in Old Georgian texts (hue sedgian igi qumirsa '(they) put it under a vessel' Mt. 5.15; kuemo 'down', kuena 'lower', etc.). In modern Georgian and Svan it can be extracted from derivative adverbs: cf. Georg, kves 'down', Svan le-kw-a 'down, below'. The Svan preverb cu- 'down' is thought also to belong here (cf. Deeters 1930: 16). || Wardrop(1911: 613).
GZ *kwe affirmative particle: Georg. k(v)e affirmative particle; Megr. ko\ Laz ko. The item occurs in Georgian medieval literature. At present the particle is used in some dialects (Imer., Raca, Xevs.). The Zan correspondence underwent a change ve > o. In Georgian and the Zan languages this particle underlies the verbal affirmative prefix (cf. Megr. ko-$ir-u 'he saw that', Laz ko-moxt-u 'he came here'). ||Topuria(1931: 65).
CK *kwec— : kwc- 'to cut': Georg, kucn- 'to mow'; Svan kwic— : kwc'to cut off'. A verb stem, extended in Georgian by the enlargement (?) -n, with a meaning 'to reap a crop of corn'. The Svan cognate shows two ablaut grades (action noun li-kwc-e). Full ablaut grade is tentatively assigned to the protoform. | | A. Cincarauli (IKE XIX, 1974, 59). Cf. also Fähnrich (1975: 342).
216



*kwin
CK *kwin- 'breathing, spirit': Georg, kvin- 'breathing, spirit'; Svan kwin, kun 'spirit, smell, odor'. The lexeme occurs in Old Georgian (cf. action noun aymo-kuin-va-), however, it seems to be absent in modern Georgian. There is no ground for including Laz kun- or kin- 'brain' here. | | Macavariani (1965: 62).
CK *kwisil- 'brother-in-law': Georg, kvisl- 'brother-in-law'; Megr. kvisil-; Svan. [Λννί-]. The kinship term is attested in Old Georgian. The Georgian and Megrelian forms regularly match each other phonetically. In Laz the word seems to be lost. The Svan correspondence is reflected in the derivative me-kws-el // me-kws-ol // mo-ks-al with the same meaning. In the past one believed the word to have been borrowed from Armenian. | | Klimov (1960: 25). Cf. ASKJa: 198.
GZ *kwrdeml- 'anvil': Georg, grdeml- 'anvil'; Megr. kulamur-, kulamor-.
In Old Georgian the lexeme occurs in the shape of kwirdeml- and gurdeml- (Abulase 1973: 103). Cf. also the dialectal Georgian variants kurtemul- (Xevs.) and metathesized dgvlem- (Imer.). In the Megrelian cognate the consonant cluster is simplified. In Laz the word seems to have been replaced by a loanword. Svan kurmil with the same meaning has been borrowed from Megrelian (cf. Kartozia 1979: 78). The term is remarkable since it reflects a metallurgical production of the ancient Kartvelians. Lezg. girdim 'block', Tab. gerdem 'boulder' and Udi g rd m 'block' apparently have a Kartvelian source. | | Klimov (1973: 364).
GZ *kian- 'to swing': Georg, kian- 'to swing'; Megr. kion-. The verb stem must be related to the stem *kan- : hi—. For an analogous correlation of the vocalism see *bzar- and *xar-. In Laz the stem is absent.
| | USKJa: 198.
GZ *kinkl— 'midge': Georg, kinkl-a— 'midge'; Megr. kinkil— 'midge of hen'. The Georgian form has a suffix with a diminutive shade of meaning. The dialectal (Psav.) variant gingl- 'tender wing of a fledgling' is related
217



*kmar
by the rules of Kartvelian sound symbolism. In Megrelian the word has a connotation 'fluff on the youngsters' face'. 1 1 Klimov (1988: 161).
GZ *kmar- 'husband': Georgian kmar- 'husband'; Megr. komong-; Laz komo$-, kimo$—.
The kinship term is amply attested in Old Georgian (am givis hnari 'you have not a husband' Jn. 4.17). The alternation of ο // i in the Zan forms reflects different types of vocalization of sonants. A pair of lexemes Megr. komol- ~ Laz komol- // kimol- 'husband, man' presupposes the parallel Zan archetype *hnal-. Another reconstruction is proposed in Cikobava (1938: 34). Sometimes one assumes a relation of the word with the verb stem *kam- : km- (cf. Savaxisvili 1937: 227; Topuria 1991: 127). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 64). Cf. also Marr (1909: 071). Laz: Deeters (1927: 11).
CK(?) *km-en- : km-n- 'to make': Georg, kmen- : hnn- 'to make'; Megr. kimin—', Laz (n)kimin— 'to knead dough'; Svan cwemin— : cwmin'to commit, make; to happen'? The verb stem is derived from a simple stem *kam- : km- with a suffix *—en. Its continuant is attested in Old Georgian where the ablaut alternation has been still preserved (kmen es\ da kmnis... 'make that! and makes...' Mt. 8.9; further derivatives were known). In Old Georgian the stem had a meaning similar to that of the Laz form :puri zetita kmnuli... 'the cake of oiled bread...' Lev. 8.26. Cf. action nouns Megr. kiminua-, Laz o—kimin—u, Svan li-cwmin-e.
| | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1980: 31). Laz, Svan: USKJa: 199.
GZ *kon- 'fat, brain': Georg, kon- 'fat'; Megr. kon-; Laz kun-, kin- 'brain'. The word is documented in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 455). The Laz form shows some deviation in its phonetics as well as in meaning; therefore its relation to the stem is sometimes considered problematic. | | Cikobava (1938: 45).
GZ *kor— 'hawk': Georgian kor— 'hawk'; Megr. kor—; Laz kur—, mkur—, mki(r)—.
The word is well attested in Old Georgian texts: dadgis kori... 'does the hawk take flight...' Job 38.26. Cf. also Old Georgian compound $er-kor- 'griffon' (Abulase 1973: 524). The original form for the Zan
218



*kreml
equivalents must be *kor-. The Laz correspondence shows secondary m as well as a change u > i. Relation to Chechen kiijr and Ingush ker 'hawk' requires clarification. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 103).
GZ *kreml- 'tear': Georgian creml- 'tear'; Megr. cilamur-; Laz cilamre-, celamre-, celamur(e)-\ Svan kirn (plural form kamr-).
The word is amply attested in Old Georgian (cremlita perqni daibanna 'with tears he washed (his) feet' Sin. mr. 32.14). Among Georgian dialectal variants cf. the metathesized Lecx. rcmel—. The lexeme illustrates the correspondence of the Svan back occlusive to the GeorgianZan affricate: cf. *gab- : gb-, *brg-, *kab- : kb-, *kad- : kd-. Beside the metathesis common for Zan and Svan data the latter shows the loss of the stem-final sonant. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849:75). Laz, Svan: Marr (1914:34).
CK *krcxml- 'hornbeam': Georg, cxeml-a- 'hornbeam'; Megr. cxemur—, cximur—; Laz cxemu(r)-, mcxe(m)br—\ Svan cxam—ra, cxum-ra, cxwim-ra.
In Old Georgian the word occurs in the form of krcxeml-. Its modern Georgian variants are characterized by the secondary affix -a: cf. rcxila(a literary form), cxila-, rcxemla-. The word-initial consonant cluster is simplified in all the languages. The Svan cognate shows the treedesignation suffix -ra. The intial k has been preserved only in Old Georgian. A slightly deviating reconstruction is proposed in PenrixiSarlwelaje (1990: 402). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Marr (1915.1 II: 822). Laz, Svan: ASKJa: 200.
GZ *kumel- Oat flour': Georg, kumel- Oat flour'; Megr. kumu-. In Georgian dialects the meaning varies somewhat (cf. yionti 1984: 578). The coda of the cognates shows a well-known correspondence Georg, -el —u. In Laz the lexeme seems to be absent. | | Klimov (1973: 364).
GZ *kursl- 'heel': Georg, kusl- 'heel'; Megr. kurs-, kurc-, kur- 'heel; kick by hoof; Laz kus-, ku(r)-. A lexeme well attested in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 459). Its most complex shape kursl— occurs in the Xevs. dialect. In Zan languages the stem is usually simplified. For the loss of the final / in Zan see *tes-l-,
219



*kurd
cjrpl-, etc. (cf., however, Laz k(r)us- 'kick by hoof, kick by foot'). The similarity of the Kartvelian forms to PIE *krus(n)- 'lower part of leg, shin' deserves mention. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 115). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 65).
GZ *kurci- 'to peel, remove crust': Georg, kurc- 'to peel, remove husk'; Megr. [kurc-]; Laz [kurc-].
In Old Georgian the verb stem is found in its noun derivative na-kurc-en- // na-kurt-en- 'crust' (Abulage 1973: 322). Its Zan correspondence is preserved vestigially: cf., on the one hand, the obvious Megrelism kurcala- 'maize husk' in the Gur. dialect of Georgian and, on the other hand, the Laz derivative do-kurc-ol-a- 'removing of the maize husk'. | | Sardschweladse (1987: 21).
CK *yad- : yd- 'to do; to speak (loudly)': Georg, [yad-] 'to speak, appeal'; Laz yod- 'to do; to report; Svan yd- 'to confer'. In Old Georgian the verb stem is reflected in the action noun yad-eb-a- 'to appeal, shout' and the substantive m-yd-el- 'priest, clergy-man'. The Laz action noun is o-yod-u 'to do; to report'. In Svan the stem is represented in the action noun li-yd-e 'to confer' with the zero grade. The Kartvelian facts show semantic alternation 'to do' // 'to speak' known from a number of other languages. | | Georgian, Laz: Sar^velase (1976: 217). Svan: Fähnrich (1984: 44).
GZ *yame- 'last night': Georg, yame— 'night, at night'; Megr. yuma'last night'; Laz yoma(n) 'yesterday'. The adverb is widely attested in Old Georgian (masve yamesa... 'at the same night...' Sin. mr. 103.12), where its derivatives are also known (Abula3e 1973: 460). In the Megrelian cognate expected underwent change into u next to the labial. For the Laz word-final n cf. yomaner'yesterday's'. The semantic unity of the material needs no commentary. The further comparison with Svan li-yamn-e 'to wait' seems unlikely. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 2). Laz: Marr (1936: 62). Cf. also Cikobava (1938: 198).

*yar- : yr
CK *yar- : yr- 'to cry; to sing': Georg, myer- 'to sing'; Megr. yor-, yvar- 'to cry, howl'; Laz myor-; Svan yar- : yr- 'to sing'. A verb stem well attested in Old Georgian, where it had additional meanings 'to play, leap': ayimyerna qrmaman... 'the babe leaped...' Lk. 1.41. As assumed by H. Schuchardt (1899: 393), the Georgian and Zan correspondences presuppose an intermediate archetype *m(y)ar-. The vocalism of the full grade *a is preserved in Svan. The zero grade is reflected in the derivative *yr-en- : yr-in-. The stem has an onomatopoeic nature. Hence its similarity to the analogous material of different languages. Cf. PIE *ger- (Pokorny 1959: 383). 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Schuchardt (1899: 393). Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 352). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 349).
GZ *yare- 'gutter, furrow': Georg, yar- 'gutter, furrow'; Megr. yore'gutter of mill; wooden dam'. The word is known from Old Georgian in the shape of yar- (Abulaje 1973: 460). The identity of the sonorous r in both languages allows one to reconstruct the word-final vowel. In Laz the word seems to have been replaced. A connection with Svan yar 'ravine' is hardly probable. 1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 37).
CK *yaryad- 'goose': Georg, yeryed- 'goose'; Megr. yoryon^-; Laz yoryog-; Svan yaryod.
From Old Georgian forms of the word such as yeryed-, yryed- and yeryet- are known (Abulase 1973: 461). The stem has an obviously reduplicated structure and seems to be connected with the verb stem *yar- : yr-. For the history of its vocalism in Georgian see Macavariani (1958: 268), Sar|vela3e (1985: 199). In both Zan languages the word-final *d results in £ (cf. *trad—, *qid—, *qund—). The Svan correspondence is marked by the vowel length. Originally the lexeme may have referred to a wild goose. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Janashvili (Erckert 1895: 682). Svan: Gren (1890: 124). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 103).
GZ *yaryar- 'to talk a lot': Georg, yayad- 'to cry, howl': Megr. yaryal'to chat'; Laz ya(r)yal- 'to speak'. A verb stem amply attested in Old Georgian texts (uyayada mas... '(he) howled at him...' Sin. mr. 10.18), where a number of its derivatives were also present. The stem contains a reduplication of the simple stem
221



*yac,w
*yar- : yr-. The breach of the regular vowel correspondence must be ascribed to the onomatopoeic nature of the forms. For a different comparison of the Zan material see Cikobava (1938: 346). 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (ibidem). Georgian: ASKJa: 201.
CK *yac!W- 'cheek': Georg, yacv- 'cheek'; Svan y ca. Attested in Old Georgian where it used to mean 'chin' too (cf. Abula3e 1973: 461). While the adduced Svan cognate belongs to the Lasx. dialect, in Svan poetry a form yac l (cf. Sv. P. 354.3) containing a diminutive affix is found. The vocalism of the latter may reflect an ancient wordfinal *vv. 1 1 Zyenti (1949: 130).
CK *yai- 'jaw': Georg, yanc- 'jaw'; Svan yck- 'to jaw; to chatter'. In the Georgian word n seems to be secondary. The Svan continuant of the stem may be seen in the verb (its action noun is li—yck—e), which forms the derivative m^-yck-e 'chatterer'. | | Sardzveladze (1991: 143).
GZ *yeb- 'to paint, color': Georg, yeb- 'to paint, color'; Megr. yap-; Laz yap-.
Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (semyebe me... 'you would plunge me...' Job 9.31). As in some other cases the Zan correspondence (action noun Megr. yapua-, Laz ο-γαρ-ύ) shows a change *b >p. The similar Svan verb stem yp-en- 'to paint black' has a Zan source as is shown by its consonant p. | | Georgian, Megrelian: cf. Topuria (1979: 90). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 347).
GZ *yel- 'to be nervous; to get frightened': Georg, yel- 'to be nervous'; Megr. yal- 'to get frightened'. In Old Georgian the action noun yelva- usually means 'wave'. A number of derivatives is also known here (Abulage 1973: 761). The Megrelian action noun is yalua—. The difference in the meaning of the cognates does not exclude the possibility of comparison. | | Sardschweladse (1982: 37).
GZ *yelo- 'ravine, gully': Georg, yelo-, yele 'ravine, gully'; Megr. yal(u)~ 'stream, rivulet'; Laz yal- 'rivulet, river'.
222



*yer
The word occurs in Old Georgian in the form yele- (seitkunes yelesa mas '(they) came together into the valley' Gen. 14.3); cf. the derivative yelovan- 'covered with ravines'. The vocalic shape of the Megrelian cognate regularly corresponds to the Georgian form. The similar Svan yel(a) 'rivulet' is a loanword from Georgian. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 5). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 183).
CK *yer- 'stem, stalk': Georg, yer- 'stem'; Laz yan$- 'leg, thigh, calf of leg'; Svan yer 'stem'. Occurs in Old Georgian texts (Abulaje 1973: 461). A parallel Georgian yero- is also widely in use. The Laz form corresponds well phonetically to the Georgian one. The Svan word seems to be inherited (cf. its vowel length). One considers the verbal stem *yer— : yir- to have been derived from this noun. Cf. (Cikobava 1938: 348). | | Georgian, Svan: Fähnrich (1987: 35).
GZ *yer- : yir- 'to stretch; to raise one's hand': Georg, yer- : yir- 'to stretch; to raise one's hand against sby.'; Laz yir-. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian: the action noun is ayereba(Abula3e 1973: 13). It seems to have a denominative origin (cf. the preceding entry). For Laz cf. action noun o-yir-u with the same meaning and o-yar-u 'to draw'. According to Fähnrich (1982: 37) Svan li-yer, li-yr—e 'to remove' also belongs here. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 348).
GZ *yery- : yry- 'to grind (coarsely); to gnaw': Georg, yery- 'to grind (coarsely); to gnaw'; Megr. yary-; Laz [yary-]. Reflected in Old Georgian by its derivative (see the following entry). The Megrelian stem (cf. action noun yaryua-) has a connotation 'to talk nonsense'. In Laz it may be recovered in the derivatives *yery-il- and *yry-wn-. The stem derives from PIE *ghergh- 'to rub coarsely' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 439). For 'to grind' see *\pekw-\ : pkw-. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 103). Laz: £SKJa: 202.
GZ *yery-il- 'coarse-ground flour': Georg, yeryil- 'coarse-ground
flour'; Megr. yaryil-; Laz yaryil-.
The word is attested in Old Georgian (cf. yeryil- 'ground grains' Lev. 2.14). It must be treated as a past participle with the affix *-il from the
223



*yey
verb *yery- : yry-. Svan yeryil- with the same meaning is a Georgian loanword. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 173).
GZ *γβγ- 'to move apart, shovel aside': Georg, yey- 'to fling open; to move apart'; Laz γαγ- 'to shovel aside; to peck'. The complete formal and semantic agreement of the Georgian and Laz data is obvious (action nouns are Georg, yeyva- and Laz ο-γαγ-u). In Laz the action refers for the most part to ashes or hay. Megrelian has no certain cognate. | | Kartozia (1979: 66-67).
CK(?) *γβέ- 'to chew': Georg, yec- 'to chew'; Megr. yac- 'to chew; to cut'; Laz yvanc- 'to chew'; Svan yarc- (?). Verb stem, which underlies the derivative *yic-wn- formed by the addition of the extension *—wn. Cf. action nouns Georg, yecva-, Megr. yacua-, Laz o-yvanc-u. The complex ck expected for Zan cognates does not develop in conformity with the presence of the stem initial y (cf. Macavariani 1958: 21). Cf. *yaCiH>-, *yic-wn-, *yoc-. The Laz correspondence underwent further transformations. It remains uncertain whether the Svan form is inherited. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Macavariani (cf. Gamqrelise 1959: 21). Laz: Kartozia (1979: 64). Svan: USKJa: 202.
CK *y(w)- 'to take, take away (of inanimate objects)': Georg. y(v)- 'to take, take away (of inanimate objects)'; Megr. y-; Laz y-; Svan y- 'to take away (of inanimate objects)'. Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian (cariyes guami misi... '(they) took up his body...' Mt. 14.12; cf. the action noun yeba-), where its derivatives are also found. The old *vv is reflected vestigially in Georg. aiyo < *ai-yv-a 'he took' and Svan action nouns Ιΐ-γ-e, li-yesg-i. This stem may underlie the verbs with an abstract meaning of possession (cf. Megr. yvena-, Svan li-ywen-e).
| | Georgian, Svan: Gren (1890: 125). Cf. Erckert (1895: 296). Megrelian: Caraja (1912: 22). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 345). See also Tseretheli (1959: 84).
GZ *Ywar3l- 'weed, darnel, tare': Georg, yvargl- 'weed; anger'; Megr. yur$ul- 'plaque; misfortune': Laz yurgul- 'poison; plaque; misfortune'.
224



*Y\vac1- : ywc,
An agricultural term well attested in Old Georgian (dastesa yuar$li '(he) sowed tares' Mt. 13.25). Cf. also the Georgian dialectal (Psav., Mtiul., Gud.) variant yor$l- (yionti 1984: 594). In the Xopa dialect of Laz the word has the additional meaning 'wicked, bad; spite'. For the vocalism of the Zan form cf. *wasl-. Despite the semantic deviation of the Zan stem the comparison seems plausible (connecting link is 'poison'). According to Saukyan (IKE XVIII, 1973: 94), Arm. xor^uil, xr$uil 'rhubarb' derives from a Kartvelian source. ESKJa: 203.
CK *ywac!- : ywc!- 'to hurry; to chase': Georg, yvac- 'to endeavor; to seek'; Megr. yunc— 'to strain oneself; Svan yvvec- : ywc- 'to chase, to follow'. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian texts, where it had a considerable rang of meanings (action noun yuca-) and a number of derivatives (Abula3e 1973: 464). The Megrelian cognate (action noun yuncua-) has a secondary n. The correspondence Georg, a ~ Svan e (action noun li-ywec) occurs in a number of other verb stems. | | Georgian, Svan: Fähnrich (1987: 35). Megrelian: Klimov (1988: 20).
CK *yweb- 'to weave, wattle': Georg, yob- 'to weave, wattle fence'; Megr. yob-; Laz yob-; Svan [yvvefc-]. In Old Georgian the verb stem is represented by the derivative yobe(see *yob-e-). The Georgian-Zan forms reflect the shift *we > (action noun Georg, yobva—, Megr. yobua-, Laz o—yob—u). In Svan the stem may be identified in a noun of obscure structure yweb, yeb 'log-trough; beehive' (a wattled bee-hive is one of the earliest cultural achievements of the Kartvelians). The similarity to PIE *uebh- or *Huebh- 'to weave' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 1114) deserves attention. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 351). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 146). Svan: ESKJa: 205.
CK(?) *ywed- 'belt, leash': Georg, yved- 'belt, girdle'; Megr. yved-, yvend-; Laz yved-; Svan ywed(7).
In Old Georgian the lexeme is attested in the form yued- with the meaning 'leash of yoke' (Abulaje 1973: 464) and 'leather' (Sar|vela3e 1995: 227). The Zan cluster ve like in other similar cases retains the original vocalism. The Svan form may have been borrowed from Georgian. The word seems to be one of the most ancient borrowings from an Indo-Euro
225



*ywel- : ywl
pean source. Cf. PIE *(H)uedh- 'leash, belt' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 1116). Cf. Klimov (1994: 74-75). | | USKJa: 203.
CK *ywel- : ywl- 'to curve; to bend': Georg, [yul- : γνΐ-] 'to curve; to bend'; Megr. [yul-]; Laz [yul-]; Svan [yul-].
The verb stem may be extracted from numerous derivatives: cf. *ywl'bent, curved', *ywl-arc- 'to roll', *ywl-erc- 'earth worm', *ywl-ek- : ywl-k- 'to curve'. Cf. also Megr. yul-iz- 'to bend'. The similarity of the stem to PIE *(ff)uel- 'to curve' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 1140) is remarkable. | | Klimov (1985: 174-175).
GZ *ywent— 'to stream down': Georg, yvent— 'to stream down, flow (through)'; Megr. yvant- 'to splash; to lap'; Svan [ywent-] 'drop'. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian texts. It may have a denominative origin: cf. the above-mentioned Svan form and the Georgian nominal correlate yvent- 'drop (of wax, fat)'. The Megrelian action noun is yvant-ap- (cf. i-yvant-u 'he splashed'). In Svan only a related substantive ywent-il can be found. In view of the Georgian-Zan *clwet'drop' it would be risky to reconstruct here a nominal protoform. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: F hnrich (1985: 37). Svan: Klimov (1985: 175).
GZ *ywer- : ywr- 'to bend': Georg, yver- 'to bend'; Megr. [yz>-]; Laz
Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. In modern Georgian it is represented in its unbound form in the Imer. dialect: action noun yverva(cf. ylonti 1984: 587). Contrary to the Georgian form its Zan correspondences reflect the zero grade. The stem forms a number of other verbal derivatives: see *y(w)r-ek- : *y(w)r-ik- : y(w)r-k- 'to curve', *yr-e$- : *yr-i^- : yr-$- 'to show one's teeth'. Cf. also Georg, yr-ec'to make a wry face', yr-ec- 'to distort', etc. | | Klimov (1985: 175).
CK *ywi- 'juniper': Georg, yvi-a- 'juniper'; Megr. [yviyv-]; Svan
Occurs in Old Georgian in the shape of ywi- and ywiv- (cf. Abula3e 1973: 464). In modern Georgian its dialectal variant yvio- is also attested
226



*ywiw
(yionti 1984: 588). The Megrelian cognate can be extracted from the continuant of the denominative verb stem *ywiw- 'to smoulder, glimmer'.
CK *Y\viw- 'to smoulder; to twinkle': Georg, yv/v- 'to smoulder; to twinkle'; Megr. yv/yv-; Laz my- (?); Svan ywiw-, yiw-. Verb stem. In the Megrelian form a secondary γ has been developed (for the analogous process see *dindg-el-, *ttx-el-, *3i$g-wn-, etc.). If the Laz form is related it must have undergone more substantial changes. A compensatory lengthening of the root vowel in the Svan cognate has resulted from the loss of the first w. If the stem is connected with Georg. yvia- 'juniper' (used in the past to be smouldered for ritual purposes in the Caucasus) the word for this tree, present only in Georgian, may be reconstructed for Common Kartvelian. | | USKJa: 203.
CK *ywino- 'wine': Georg, γνίηο- 'wine'; Megr. yvin-; Laz y(v)/«-; Svan ywin-el, ywin-al.
In the form ywino- the term is widely attested in Old Georgian, where it meant also 'vinegar' and formed some compounds (staasxian ywinoj axali... '(they) put new wine...' Mt. 9.17; misces mas sumad ywinoj navyelreuli '(they) gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall' Mt. 27.34). The word-final vowel in Georgian is not stable (cf. its genitive form yvm-i's). The Svan correspondence is represented only with the petrified diminutive affix, which speaks in favor of its inherited character. The lexeme must be treated as a very early Indo-European loanword: cf. PIE *ueino- (Pokorny 1959: 1121). It cannot go back to Armenian gini because the change *u > g probably must have been accomplished there long before the first Kartvelian-Armenian contacts in the 7th-6th centuries B.C. (cf. Diakonoff 1985: 600-601). | | Bopp (1847:28). Cf. also Erckert (1895: 294), Caraya (1912:41), Deeters (1938: 39).
GZ *vwl- 'bent, curved': Georg, yul- 'kind of sickle'; Megr. yula- 'bent, crooked'; Laz yul(a}- 'crooked, squint'. In Old Georgian the word occurs in the form ofmyul- (Abula3e 1973: 303). The lexeme must be related to the verb stem *ywel- : ywl- 'to curve'. In the Zan cognates a word-formation element -a is usually present. Cf. also the Laz adjective toli-yula- 'squint-eyed'. It remains unclear whether the Svan yulaj "knee' belongs here. Klimov (1985: 175).
227



*ywl-az
GZ *ywl-az- 'to get crooked; to bend': Georg, yvlaz- 'to get crooked; to bend (not good-looking)'; Megr. yuloz-, A verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language it is reflected in dial. (Imer.) γίαζνα- (cf. yionti 1984: 591). For Megrelian cf. the action noun (md)yulozua-. The form is derived from *ywel- : ywlwith an enlargement -az. A connection with Old Georg. gular$na- 'to get crooked; to bend' is hardly acceptable.
CK *vwl-ar3!- 'to get crooked; to bend': Georg, gularc-n- 'to get crooked; to bend'; Svan yurga-n-. Verb formation attested in Old Georgian, where a past participle yularcn-il- // gular$n-il- 'crooked' is also found (Abula3e 1973: 83, 99; Sar|vela3e 1995: 227). It is derived from *ywel-: ywl- 'to curve' by adding an unclear element *ar$i-. The shift of the initial γ into g in the Georgian word seems to be due to its contamination with the noun stem gul— 'heart'. In Svan / was lost whereas the former consonant sequence r^- is regularly reflected as r$-. In both languages a suffixal enlargement is to be noted. | | Georgian, Svan: Sadschweladse (1987: 17).
CK *ywl-ar£- 'to twist, roll': Georg, yvlarc-n- to twist, roll'; Megr. yulock-, Svan [ywasq-].
The continuant of the verb stem occurs in Old Georgian in the form yularcn-, ylarcn- (Abula3e 1973: 464). Cf. also a past participle yularcn-il-. It is one of the derivatives formed from the verb *ywel- : ywl- 'to curve', which has a noun correlate *ywl-erc- 'earthworm' (see below). The Georgian form contains an extension -n. In the Zan languages the cluster ck according to Gamkrelidze's law regularly reflects the historical morpheme -(a)rc- with an obscure meaning. The Svan equivalent of the stem can be seen in its noun correlate. 1 1 Klimov (1985: 175).
GZ *ywl—ek— : ywl—ik— 'to get crooked, get curved'; Georg, [yvlek-] 'to get crooked, get curved'; Megr. [ylik-]; Laz yvelik-, ylik-. Verb stem derived from the simple base *ywel- : ywl— 'to get curved' by addition of *—ek— : —ik. In Georgian it is reflected in its noun correlate xvlik- (< *ywlik-) 'lizard', where the word-initial consonant is assimilated to the final one. The stem is preserved in its unbound state only in Laz (cf. action noun o-yvelik-u). | | Klimov (1985: 175).
228



*ywl-erc
CK *ywl-er£- 'earthworm': Georg. yvle(r)c- 'spiral rod'; Megr. yve(r)ck-, yve(n)ck- 'earthworm'; Svan yw sq.
A noun correlate of the verb stem *ywl-arc-. Its vocalism reflects the effect of earlier umlaut. Cf. also the Georgian dialectal form yvlenc-. In Laz the word seems to be lost. The Svan replacement of expected sk by sq requires an explanation. The Georgian lexeme underwent a semantic shift. 1 1 Megrelian, Svan: Rogava (1952-1963: 61). Georgian: Klimov (1985: 175-176).
GZ *y(w)r-ek- : y(w)r-ik- : y(w)r-k- 'to crook (get crooked), curve (get curved)': Georg, yrek- : yrik- 'to crook (get crooked), curve (get curved)'; Megr. yirak- : yrik- : yirik-; Laz yrik-.
In Old Georgian the verb stem is found in the past participle yrek-il'bent, crooked'. The stem is derived from the simple base *ywer- : ywrby adding the extension *-ek- : -ik and seems to be connected with *xr-ek- : xr-k- with a similar meaning. Its further derivative is *y(w)rek-il-. The Georg. yria(n)kal- 'scorpion' appears also to be related. The similar Svan stem ywrek— derives from a Georgian source. 206.
GZ *y(w)rek-il- 'crooked, bent': Georg, yrekil- 'crooked, bent; maimed'; Megr. yirakil— 'crooked; maimed'. Attested in Old Georgian (yrekilni ganikurnebodes . .. 'the maimed got whole...' Mt. 15.31). It is a past participle derived from the verb stem * y(w)r-ek- : y(w)r-k- with the suffix *-//. A Laz cognate seems to be absent. | | Klimov (1988: 162).
GZ *yi- 'to weep': Georg, yz'(v)- 'to weep softly'; Megr. yi- 'to weep'. The verb stem belongs to a number of descriptive formations imitating sounds: cf. */«-, *qi-, *ci- etc. The action nouns are Georg. yiv-iV-, Megr. γΐ-αρ-.
1 1 F hnrich (1982: 37).
GZ(?) *yitin- 'to tickle': Georg, yitin- 'to tickle'; Megr. xicin-; Laz xitin—.
The Zan forms underwent a change y > χ through a process of regressive assimilation. It is more difficult to explain the substitution of / in the
229



*yic-wn
Megrelian cognate. The word contains an element of sound-symbolism (cf. Arm. xitil, Udi xitik with the same meaning). | | ESKJa: 204.
GZ *yi6-wn- 'to gnaw': Georg, yicn- 'to gnaw'; Megr. xicon-, xicor-. A derivative from the simple base *yec- formed with the affix *-wn. The Megrelian cognate (action noun xiconua—) shows a change γ >χ. The form with stem-final r is due to the analogy with some other Megrelian verbs with the same meaning. | | USKJa: 204.
GZ *yi|-in- 'to speak (with a smile)': Georg. yi$-in- 'to speak (with a smile)'; Megr. yi^g-in- 'to smile, laugh (wryly)'. Verb stem containing the suffix —in. In Old Georgian it is unattested. At present it occurs as a dialectal (Moxev.) form (cf. yionti 1984: 591); cf. also the Kartl. reduplicated formation yigyig- 'din, row'. The relation to *γτ-β$- : yr-ig- : yr$- is possible. | | F hnrich (1982: 37).
GZ *γ1- 'to tear': Georg, [y/-] 'to fight; to tear'; Megr. [yil-, yr-J; Laz
[y/-SJi.mple verb base which no longer occurs in its unbound state, but may be extracted from the derivative stem * yl—et- : *yl-ii- : yl—t— with the same meaning.
GZ *yl-et- : yl-it- : yl-t- 'to tear up': Georg, ylet- : ylit- 'to tear up'; Megr. yilat- : yilit- : yrt-; Laz ylat- : ylit-.
Derived from the simple base *yl- with the extension -et : -it (see *—ed : —id). Cf. the action nouns Georg, yleta—, Megr. yilatua— (intrans.), yilitua- (trans.), Laz o-ylit-u and its derivative *ylet-il- 'torn, ragged'. Svan li-yrt-in-e 'to gnaw' does not seem to be related. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: cf. Topuria (1979: 37). Laz: USKJa: 204.
GZ *ylet-il- 'torn, ragged': Georg, [yletil]- 'torn, ragged'; Megr. yilatir-; Laz ylate(r)-.
A past participle in —// based on the verb stem *ylet— : ylit— : ylt— 'to tear up'. The Georgian form may be extracted from modern participle da-yletil- with the same meaning. The Laz equivalent is adapted to adjectives ending in —er.
230



*ylia
GZ(?) *vlia- 'armpit': Georg, ylia- 'armpit'; Megr. (r)yia-. Attested in Old Georgian (Abula^e 1973: 462). The parallel form iylia- used more frequently in modern Georgian contains, according to Topuria (1979: 456), a former prefix. The Megrelian correspondence underwent a consonant metathesis. The question arises whether the first component of Laz yala-gig- with the same meaning is related. As to the -ylia extracted from the Svan prefixal formation laylia 'armpit', its native character is very doubtful. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 114). Svan: USKJa: 204.
GZ *ymu- 'to howl, roar': Georg, ymu- 'to howl, roar'; Laz yum-in- 'to roar (about sea)'. The verb stem has a transparent onomatopoeic structure: cf. *bzu—, *zmu-, *ckmu- as well as its characteristic word-forming affixes. Cf. the action nouns ymu-il- in Georgian and yum-in- in Megrelian. | | USKJa: 204.
CK(?) *yob-e- 'wattle-fence': Georg, yobe- 'wattle-fence'; Megr. yober-; Laz yobe(r)-; Svan yweb (pi. stem yob-) 'bee-hive'(?).
Apparently a Common Kartvelian word attested in Old Georgian (Sar|vela3e 1995: 226). The identity of the vowel e in Georgian and Zan forms indicates a secondary character of r in the latter (reshaping to the participles ?). The lexeme must be considered a nominal derivative from the verb stem *yweb- formed with the suffix -e. \ \ Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 351). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 146). Svan: USKJa: 205.
GZ *yolo— 'horse sorrel': Georg, yolo- 'horse sorrel'; Megr. oyvalo'wood sorrel'; Laz yval(u)- 'horse sorrel'. The specific vocalic shape of the word deserves attention. The transformation ο > να is found elsewhere in the Zan branch. The development of the word-initial vowel in Megrelian is hardly conditioned phonetically. | | F hnrich (1984: 44).
GZ *yom(u)- 'fox-tail millet': Georg, yom- 'fox-tail millet; millet porridge'; Megr. yumu-; Laz yom(u)-.
This agricultural term belongs to a number of examples illustrating a correspondence Georg. 0 - Zan u in word-final position. The change ο >
231



*yor
u in the Megrelian form is due to the adjacent m. The word seems to be one of the cultural borrowings from an ancient Near Eastern source. Its East Iranian analogies (cf. Ishkashmi, Wakhi yomu, Munji yomu 'fodder bean plant, lentil') must have the same origin and testify to the age of the word-final u. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 72). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 174).
GZ *yor- 'swine': Georg, yor- 'swine'; Megr. ye$-; Laz ye$-. Attested in Old Georgian texts: kolti yorta 'herd of swines' Mt. 8.30. The vocalism of the Zan form presupposes an intermediate step ve (cf. Cikobava 1938: 82). The question arises whether Georg. yo$- 'fang' represents an ancient Zan loanword. The comparison with Svan x m 'swine' (cf.Tseretheli 1959: 82) is impossible. The word seems to be an ancient cultural borrowing from Indo-European: cf. PIE *ghor- or *ghoir- 'swine, sucking pig' (Pokorny 1959: 445). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 72). Laz: Marr (1909: 0158), Cikobava (1938: 82).
GZ *yor- 'to deceive': Georg, yor- 'to deceive'; Megr. yor-; Laz yord-, yerd-.
Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (Sar|vela3e 1995: 144) and in the language of Rustaveli (524.4, 745.1). Cf. the modern Georgian action noun moyoreba-. In Laz the later passive marker -d (cf. mo-b-yor-d-i Ί am deceived) became, as a result of metanalysis, a part of the stem (action noun o-yerd-in-u). A connection with *yor'swine' seems possible (cf. French abetir 'to deceive' alongside bete 'animal'). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 34). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 350).
GZ *yor§o- 'gob (fish)': Georg, yorgo- 'gob (fish)'; Megr. yo(n)$go'worthless'; Laz yor$go— 'gob (fish), worthless' (refers to things). Seems to be a derivative from the verb stem *yr-e$- : yr-i$- : yr-$with a characteristic vocalism o. In the Zan cognates the original ξ next to r according to Gamkrelidze's law is reflected by the cluster $g. In Megrelian the lexeme is almost replaced by the Georgian word, the native term being preserved only in certain phrases: cf. yo(n)$go bosi 'worthless fellow'. The apparent polysemy of the Laz word provides an ex

*yoc
planation for the diiference in meaning of the Georgian and Megrelian forms.
1 1 USKJa: 206.
GZ *yo£- 'to crumple': Georg, yoc- 'to crumple'; Megr. yuc-. Verb stem. Action nouns are Georg, yocva- and Megr. yucua-. In the Megrelian form the expected velar element does not develop after the affricate due to the presence of in the stem. The shift o > u needs explanation. 1 1 Fähnrich (1972: 661).
GZ *yr- 'to fade': Georg, yr- 'to fade'; Svan [yr-]. A dialectal (Gur.) form in Georgian (action noun yr-om-a-, da-yr-a-). Its Svan equivalent may be extracted from ma-yr-a 'dried-up tree'. Cf. also *(m)zyr- with the same meaning. | | Sardschweladse (1987: 21).
GZ *yr-en- : yr-in- 'to snarl' (refers to dogand other animals): Georg. yren- : yrin- 'to snarl'; Megr. yirin-, ysrin-\ Laz yi(r)in-.
Verb formation from the base *yar- : yr-. Its derivative is known in Old Georgian : m-yrin-av- 'brown owl' (Abulaje 1973: 303): Cf. also Rustaveli 911.3. The element -en : -in may derive from the causative affix. For the Zan languages cf. action noun Megr. yirinua- and Laz o-yirin—u. As a rule r is absent in the Laz form. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 106). Laz: USKJa: 206.
GZ *yr-e|-: yr-i|- : yr-$- 'to frown': Georg. yre$- : yrig- 'to frown'; Megr. yin^g-in-; Laz [yingg-].
The verb stem is known from Old Georgian (cf. past participle dayre^il- 'frowned, sad') and the medieval Georgian texts (dayregit zis... '(he) is sitting and frowning...' Rustaveli 102.4). It is one of the derivatives from the base *ywer- : ywr-. The correspondence Georg, r ~ Zan n remains unexplained. Representation by $g confirms the age of Zan «. The Megrelian form contains a secondary affix. The Laz correspondence is extracted from the derivative noun (see * yr$-il-). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cikobava (1938: 55). Another connection for the Georgian form is proposed in Fähnrich (1984:44).
GZ *yrma- 'hole, pit': Georg, yrma- 'deep'; Megr. [ryoma-] 'deeping'; Laz yorma— 'hole, pit, chink'.
233



*yrmat
The lexeme is widely used in Old Georgian (gurymuli ese yrma ars 'the well is deep' Jn. 4.11). Cf. also the Georgian dialectal variants ryma-, yma-, yrime-. The Megrelian match may be extracted from derivatives like ino-ryoma- 'deepening' and ryoma-ga- 'hollow tree' showing a consonant metathesis. The identity in final vowels points to the former substantive character of this stem, reflected still in Old Georgian texts (seavline navi ege yrmad 'launch out the ship into the deep' Lk. 5.4). Similarity to dialectal Indo-European *r(u)ghma- 'hole, pit' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 869) deserves mention. Cf. Klimov 1994: 152-154. | | Georgian, Laz: Marr (1936: 146). Megrelian: Fähnrich (1984: 44).
CK *yrmat- 'God': Georg, ymert- 'God'; Megr. yoront-; Laz yormot-; Svan yerbet, yermet, yermat.
Common Kartvelian term. It is amply attested in Old Georgian (movida ymerti... 'God has come...' Ex. 20.20) with a number of derivatives. The Georgian form is characterized by a consonant metathesis and the effect of historical umlaut. The Svan dative case form yerbat as well as the Zan data serves to support positing an earlier historical vocalism a. 1 1 Rosen (1845: 33).
GZ(?) *yrtil- 'cartilage': Georg, xrtil- 'cartilage'; Megr. xintkir-, xsntkir-.
In Old Georgian the word occurs in the form yrtil- (Abulaje 1973: 463). If this comparison holds one must admit devoicing of the wordinitial consonant. However, the complex consonant cluster in Megrelian remains unclear. | | Klimov (1973: 367).
GZ *yru(n)t- 'to grunt': Georg, yrut-un- 'to grunt'; Megr. yvint-; Laz yrut-, xrut- (?).
The Georgian form contains a secondary word-forming affix. The Megrelian correspondence reminds one of parallel Georgian yvrit-in-. The Svan analogy (cf. the action noun li-yrut-an-i) seems to be borrowed from Georgian. Taking into account the Georgian (Gur.) form yrunt- the connection with its Indo-European analogies like Lat. grundio and English grunt alongside PIE *gru- (cf. Pokorny 1959: 406) may be admitted. See Klimov 1994: 154—155. North Caucasian designations of grunting clearly reflect the area norm of the onomatopoeia and stand phonetically far apart. | | ESKJa: 207.
234



*yrv-wn
GZ *yry—wn— 'to gnaw': Georg, yryn— 'to gnaw'; Megr. yiryon—; Laz yiryol-.
Verb stem derived from the simple base *yery- : yry— by adding the word-forming suffix *-\vn. The Georgian and Megrelian cognates (action noun Georg, yryna-, Megr. yiryonua-) match regularly. In Laz (action noun o— yiryol— u) a change n > I is attested (cf. *brdy-wn-, and others). The archetype *yuryura- proposed in Marr (1936: 146) has no support. | | ESKJa: 207.
GZ(?) *yr3i- 'to embrace': Georg. yr$- 'to suffocate'; Megr. [yur$-, yurz-] 'to embrace'. A problematic comparison. The Georgian action noun yr$oba-, dayr$oba- is adduced by S. Orbeliani. The Megrelian variants are characterized by the addition of the suffix -ol (action noun yurgolua-) and by possible spirantization of 3. ||Klimov(1988:21).
CK *yr£-en- : yro-in- 'to gnash, grit the teeth': Georg, yrcen- : yrcin'to gnash, grit the teeth'; Megr. yirckin-, ydrckin-; Laz yrickin-, yrickil-; Svan ydckin-, yalckan-.
Verb stem attested in Old Georgian: ...iyrcenn kbilta '...(he) gnashes (his) teeth' Mk. 9.18 (cf. action noun y(r)cena-). -en : -in must be a former suffix. The correspondence Georg, c ~ Zan ck in position after r is regular. Cf. Gamqreli3e (1959: 76). Stem-final / of the Laz cognate is secondary. / in the Svan form (cf. action noun ydck-an-e) replaces the original r.
1 1 USKJa: 207.
GZ *yr§-wn- 'to cut (with a blunt knife)': Georg. yr$n- 'to cut (with a blunt knife), shred'; Megr. yir^gon-, yar^gon-. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian: ...rtota mat yrgnides '...(they) shredded branches' (Sar|vela3e 1995: 227). It contains the no longer productive affix -wn, Megr. action noun - yir^gonua-. Georgian dial. (Imer.) yirggna- (cf. yionti 1984: 90) seems to be contaminated with the Megrelian word. It is tempting to see a relation to the root *yr-e$- :
GZ *yr^—U- 'gums, molars': Georg. yr$il-, yr$il- 'gums, molars'; Megr. girgil- 'gums'; Laz yin$gil-, yenggil- 'gums; sting (of bee)'.
235



*yu
A derivative of the verb stem *yr-e$- : yr-$- formed by the past participle suffix -il. The Georgian form with 3 may have resulted from a blend of the word with yrgoba- 'to wrench, dislocate'. The Megrelian correspondence has undergone maximal change (cf. also the variant
ΗCi-kobava (1938: 55).
CK *yu- Owl': Megr. yu- Owl'; Laz (m)yu-; Svan yuh. Uncertain reconstruction. In view of the existence of forms with wordinitial b another protoform must also be admitted (see *b(y)u-). In both cases the onomatopoeic character of the cognates remains beyond doubt. The Svan form belongs to the Upper Bal dialect.
GZ *Yuv-un- 'to coo': Georg, yuyun- 'to coo'; Megr. yuyin-, The transparent onomatopoeic nature of the verb is confirmed by its characteristic word-forming affix. Similar lexemes with this meaning or with the meaning of dove occur in many languages (cf. Godob. yuyu, Ingus qoq,Turk, qoq,etc.). | | Kipsidze (1914: 353).
CK *qaw- : qw- 'to lead, have' (referring to animate objects): Georg. qav- : qv- 'to lead, have' (referring to animate objects); Megr. '(o)-; Laz qo-, 'v-; Svan q(a)-. Verb stem rarely attested in Old Georgian; it was usually replaced by the extended stem qvan-. The Georgian and Zan forms match regularly. The history of their Svan counterpart is a little more complicated. The meaning of possession must be secondary. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 40). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 356). Svan: USKJa: 208.
GZ *qaw : qw- 'to make': Georg, qav- : qv- 'to make'; Megr. 'v-; Laz q(v)-,''v-J(v)n-.
The verb stem is especially characteristic for Old Georgian {...qves egre '...(they) made so' Mt. 21.6; action noun qopa-). Its connection with the identical Georgian-Zan stem 'to lead, have' is recognized in Kartvelo
236



*qaw- : qw
logy. The Zan forms reflect only the zero ablaut grade. The final v disappears here positionally. ||Cikobava(1938:351-353).
GZ *qaw- : qw- 'to curdle (milk)': Georg, qav- : qv- 'to curdle (milk)'; Megr. [V-j; Laz [qv-, V-]. The verb stem forms the basis of the noun derivative *qw—el- 'cheese' owing to which it is identified also in the Zan languages. Laz meqwaper'sour milk' contains the same base. For Georgian an unbound use of the stem is attested only in ancient texts (cf. M. Sani3e 1960: 63, where its relation to *qaw- : qw- 'to make' is admitted). Its modern Georgian match ded- (action noun se-ded-eb-a-) strikingly resembles PIE *dhedh- with the same meaning (cf. Mayrhofer 1991: 692), although most probably it goes back to deda- 'rennet'. ||Klimov(1973:364).
GZ *qamal- 'wild cherry-plum': Georg, tqemal- 'wild cherry-plum'; Megr. Omur-; Laz qomur-, Omur-, omr—.
Unattested in Old Georgian, but represented in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani. Since the word-initial t cannot disappear in Zan languages one must assume a contamination of the Georgian form with tqe- 'wood'. In the Zan languages *a next to a labial regularly results in u. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 126).
GZ *qana- 'cornfield, ploughed field': Georg, qana- 'cornfield, ploughed field'; Megr. 'vana—; Laz qona—, Ona—,jona—.
A term referring to the settled agriculture and unattested in Svan. Its continuant is widely used in Old Georgian texts (ixilet qanebi... 'look on the fields...' Jn. 4.35; cf. the derivatives qanobir- 'ploughed field' and kue-qana- 'land, country'). The Zan equivalents underwent the changes q > ' and ο > να.
I | Georgian, Zan: Marr (1909: 0155), Savaxisvili (1930: 122).
GZ *qar- : qr- 'to stink': Georg, qar-: qr- 'to stink, reek'; Megr. [ Or-]. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (qrodis-γα... '(he) stinketh...' Jn. 11.39). Cf. the Georgian action noun qrola- alongside qars 'it stinks'. In Megrelian the stem may be extracted from the extended formation Or-ad- : "Or-id- : Or-d- 'to rot (trans., intrans.), stink'. | | Vogt (1947: 75).
237



*qar- : qr
GZ *qar- : qr- 'to pour, run out; to stream': Georg, qar- : qr- 'to pour, run out'; Laz qor-, or- 'to stream, flow'. Verb stem found in Old Georgian, where it meant also 'to shake; to nod, wag (one's head)': .. .qrides tavsa matsa '.. .wagging theif heads' Mk 15.29. Cf. Laz (Xopa) action noun me-or-u 'to stream, flow'. No certain Megrelian cognate is known. For the semantics cf. Engl. pour, Arm. acel, t'ap'vel.
||Kartozia(1979:67-68).
GZ *qarqant- 'gullet, throat': Georg, qarqanto- 'gullet' (refers to animals); Megr. qorqont- 'gullet'; Laz qirqint-, Unattested in Old Georgian. The sound-symbolic nature of the stem is shown by its phonological structure. Cf. dialectal Georgian (Gur.) qrontwith the same meaning. Georg. (Imer.) qanqrato- (> Svan qanqrät) and (Javax) qaqlanto— show metathesis. The parallel Svan qarqand is also unlikely to be native. | | Georgian, Laz: Marr (1909: 0155-0156), Megrelidze (1938: 191). Megrelian: Klimov (1973: 364).
CK *qba- 'jaw': Georg, qba- 'jaw'; Megr. 'viba- 'the man with the stupid face'; Svan (h}a-qba, a-baqa, qab(w), qpa ö 'cheek'.
The word is attested in Old Georgian texts (qbani... stamusvril arian 'jaws ... are broken' Krest 151.19-20). In the Upper Bal and Lower Bal dialects of Svan the initial consonant cluster is disrupted by the insertion of a vowel of the timbre peculiar to the dropped word-final vowel (for such a phenomenon cf. *dye-, *tqa-, etc.). In view of Svan qab 'beard', an archetype *qab- is proposed in Penrixi-Sar$vela3e (1990: 360). | | Georgian, Megrelian: I. Kobalava. Svan: Schmidt (1960: 140).
CK *qel- 'neck': Georg, qel- 'throat, neck of vessel'; Megr. 'al- 'neck, neck of vessel'; Laz (q)al-, 'al-, Svan [ql-] 'neck'. In Old Georgian the word meant 'neck' (seexvia qelsa missa... '(he) fell on his neck...' Lk. 15.20). In Megrelian the lexeme has been almost completely replaced (cf. its derivative 'ales- 'collar'). The Svan correspondence is preserved in the derivative ms-ql-a 'neck, throat'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 75). Laz: Marr (1936: 308). Svan: Schmidt (1962: 140).
CK *qem- : qm- 'to thirst': Georg, qm- 'to hunger'; Megr. 'urn- 'to thirst';*Laz (q)om-, mb-; Svan qm- 'to choke'.
238



*qemal
Although its continuant does not exist in modern Georgian, the verb stem is well represented in Old Georgian: cf. the action noun si-qm-iland da—qm—oba— as well as the derivative da—qm—eda— 'to fast' (Abula£e 1973: 129). In the Zan languages the stem is extended by affixation (action noun Megr. 'um-en-, Laz o-(q)om-in-u) and reflects the full ablaut grade. The Svan action noun is li-qm-e. In view of Common Kartvelian *ms(i)- 'to hunger' the meaning of the Zan cognates must be the original one. | | Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Topuria (1927: 287). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 355).
CK *qemal- 'wild cherry-plum': Georg, tqemal- 'wild cherry-plum'; Megr. Omur—; Laz qomufr)-, Omur-, ombr—.
The word-initial / in Georgian can be accounted for by an association of the lexeme with *tqe(n)- 'forest'. Cikobava (1938: 126) has seen in it the former exponent of a grammatical class. In the Zan languages *a next to a labial regularly results in u. The Zan cognates may reflect an earlier form with a in the first syllable (cf. Macavariani 1958: 268). 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 126).
GZ *qeq- 'to be quite full': Georg, qeq- 'to be quite full; to eat to satiety'; Megr. qaq-· A verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language found in Imer. and Gur. dialects (ylonti 1984: 607), it belongs to the stock of expressive vocabulary, as indicated by its consonantal frame. Action nouns are Georg, qeqva-, Megr. qaqua-. 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 35).
GZ *qwan- 'to conduct, bring (of animate objects)': Georg, qvan- 'to conduct, bring (of animate objects)'; Megr. On-, 'un-; Laz (q)on-, On-, jon—.
Verb stem amply attested in Old Georgian (moiqvane qrmaj... 'bring the boy...' Gen. 21.18). It is formed from a simple base *qaw- : qw- 'to lead' by an extension -an. In modern Georgian it occurs also in the meaning 'to have' (cf. $mebi mqvanan have brothers'). 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 356-357).
GZ *qwar- 'to love': Georg, qwar- 'to love'; Megr. Or-; Laz (q)or-,

239



*qw-el
Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian (mamasa uquars ^ej 'the Father loveth the son' Jn. 3.35; action noun si-quar-ul- 'love'). The forms compared regularly match each other. In Laz the cognate is more typical of the Xopa dialect. It is uncertain whether Svan qur- II qwir(action noun li-l-qwir 'coire') belongs here as is assumed sometimes. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 75). Laz: Schuchardt (1902.2: 401).
GZ *qw-el- 'brynza': Georg, qvel- 'brynza, cheese'; Megr. 'να/-; Laz (q)val-, kval-.
A word widely attested in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 466). It is derived from the verb stem *qaw- : qw- 'to curdle (milk)' by adding the word-forming affix *-el. The Zan dialects show the regular correspondence q II ' ~ k. The Svan stem represented in the verb li-qel-e 'to curdle milk' showing a compensatory vowel lengthening is borrowed from Georgian. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849:76). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 95).
CK *qwelp- 'hot ashes': Georg, yvelp- 'hot ashes'; Megr. γναΐρ-; Laz yvampo-, yvampu- 'soot'; Svan qwelp 'ashes'.
In the shape of yuelp- the lexeme occurs in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 464). Contrary to the Georgian and Megrelian words, which regularly correspond to each other, Laz shows a certain semantic shift along with substitution / > m (the latter can probably be accounted for by the formal repulsion from Laz yvalpu- 'mole cricket'). For the phonetic correspondence Georg, γ- Svan q cf. *qwi^\~l- (it may go back to the alleged Common Kartvelian voiced pharyngeal lost in all modern languages). | | Klimov (1988: 21).
GZ *qwent— : qwnt— 'to oscillate, vacillate': Georg, qunt-al— 'to rock (while*walking)'; Megr. 'vant- 'to oscillate'. In Georgian (Imer. dialect) the verb stem is extended by the wordforming affix —al (yionti 1984: 616). In both languages different ablaut grades are reflected. The Megrelian action noun is 'vantua-, 1 1 F hnrich (1982: 37).
CK *qwer- 'testicle': Georg, qver- 'testicle'; Megr. 'va^f-; Laz qva$-; Svan [qur—].
Represented in Old Georgian manuscripts as quer- (cf. Sar^velase 1995: 228). The Georgian and Zan forms regularly reflect the protoform.
240



*qwer
Their Svan equivalent seems to be attested in the complex formation with the same meaning qurnaQ) containing the element -naj, sometimes in the past considered a former plural marker (cf. Marr 1915.1: 772). For the correspondence Georgian-Zan ve ~ Svan u see *tkwer-, | | Georgian, Megrelian: Marr (1936: 275). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 353). Svan: Klimov (1960: 25).
CK(?) *qwer- 'to geld, castrate': Georg, qver- 'to geld'; Megr. 'var-; Laz qva(r)-\ Svan qor-(l).
Possibly Common Kartvelian verb stem. This characteristic cattlebreeding term has apparently a denominal origin. For Old Georgian cf. past participle querul- 'castrated' (Sar|vela3e 1995: 228). In Laz the stem-final r may be missing (cf. the action noun o-qva(r)-u alongside Megr. 'varua-). Some doubts exist concerning the inherited status of the Svan form because of its vocalic shape (cf. the preceding entry). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Marr (1936: 275). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 353). Svan: Klimov (1960: 25).
GZ *qwerb- 'hearth': Georg, qverb- 'hearth, brazier'; Megr. qebur-, 'ebur—, kebur—\ Laz [krebul-].
A problematic equation. This technical term is well attested in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 469), where its derivative querbeul- 'bread baked in the ashes' also occurs. In the Zan forms one can see the result of a metathesis rb > br. The vocalism e is regularly preserved in the original sequence we. The Laz correspondence may be extracted from its derivative o-krebul-e // o-rkebul-e 'place around the hearth'. The lexeme seems to be an ancient cross-cultural loanword.
CK *qwint- 'to plunge (into smth)'. Georg, qvint- 'to dive, plunge (into drowsiness)'; Megr. 'vint- 'to plunge into the water; to doze'; Svan qwent— 'to plunge'. Unattested in Old Georgian. The Georgian action noun is qvintva-, the Megrelian one- 'vintua-. In Laz no continuant seems to be preserved. It remains somewhat disputable whether its Svan analogue (action noun li-qwent and li-qunt-e) is native. \\USKJa:2li.
CK *qwi3!- 'to raise, wake, be awake': Georg. γνΐ$- 'to raise, wake, be awake'; Megr. [qviz-]; Svan [qwiz-].
241



*qwi3i-l
Verb stem preserved as such only in Georgian, where it occurs also in the ancient written sources: cf. action noun ywi$eba- (Abulaje 1973: 465). In other languages the stem may be seen in the continuants of its nominal derivatives *qwi$il- 'liver'. The semantic connection of the latter with the stem can be proposed as the basis of an assumption that for the ancient Kartvelians physical and mental health depended on the liver.
CK *qwi3i-l- 'liver': Georg. γνΐ$1- 'liver'; Megr. [qvizil-] 'black-violet';
•*
Svan qwize, quze 'liver'. The word is attested in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 465). Alongside dialectal Georg, yv/rj/- note the adjective qvit-el- 'yellow'. The regular Zan correspondence is reflected in the Georgian loanword from Zan qvizil- 'black-violet'. Cf. also Megrelian word-form ί-qvizin-an-s '(he) looks yellow and unhealthy'. The nature of the word-final e in the Svan cognate remains obscure. | | Georgian, Svan: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 296). Megrelian: &SKJa:2\\.
CK *qw(l)ep- : qw(l)ip- : qw(l)p- 'to strip off, scratch off; to fade': Georg, qvlep- : qv'lip- 'to strip off, pluck'; Svan qwep- 'to fade'. Verb stem. For the parasitic / in the Georgian forms cf. *dgw(l)ep-, *tkw(l)ep-, *cxw(l)-et-, and others. In the Zan languages the stem seems to be unattested. While the Georgian material shows an e ~ / alternation, its Svan equivalent reflects a different pattern; cf. action noun li-qwp-e (transitive), li-qwep (intransitive). | | Gamqreli3e-Macavariani (1965: 201).
GZ *qwl-iw- 'bone': Georg, qvliv- 'shoulder bone'; Megr. 'vz7-, 'vile'bone'; Laz qvil-, ΊΙ-, il-.
The protoform is reconstructed tentatively because of the obscure structure of the word end. Its meaning also remains uncertain in view of competing *jijiwa/- 'bone'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 27). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 71).
GZ *qi- 'to crow' (of a rooster): Georg, qi-v- 'to crow (of a rooster); cry'; Megr. '/-; Laz qi-. Verb stem. Its continuant is attested in Old Georgian: meqseulad katami qiva 'immediately the cock crew' Lk. 22.60. Action noun Georg.

Verb stern well attested in Old Georgian texts: action noun qidva- and sqida— 'to acquire, buy' (Abulaje 1973: 466). The Megrelian action noun is 'id-ir-. The Laz forms, on account of their inorganic r and general similarity to the Megrelian action noun, make one doubt their age. Their Svan analogue (action noun li-qd-ί) seems to be borrowed. 1 1 Deeters. Cf. Schmidt (1962: 141).

Verb stem amply attested in Old Georgian (mqinvarita mit seiqinnes... 'from the glacier (they) were frozen...' Sin. mr. 119.20; action noun daqineba-, derivative qin-el- 'ice'). The Zan cognates (action noun Megr. 'inua-, Laz o-qin-u) regularly correspond to Georgian. It is much more difficult to connect with the stem the similar Svan form. Sometimes the Kartvelian stem is considered to be denominative (cf. Laz qin- 'cold, frost'). 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 34). Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 76).
CK *qlap- : qlp- 'to swallow': Georg, qlap- 'to swallow'; Megr. 'ulip-;
» · ·· · ·
Svan qdlp—.
A descriptive verb stem (cf. the final expressive/;). The Megrelian correspondence (action noun 'ulipua-) like the Svan one appears to reflect zero grade. The change/? >p may be due to a blend of the stem with some other one. The Svan action noun is li-qalp-i. \ | Georgian, Megrelian: Sardschweladse (1985: 25). Svan: F hnrich (1987: 35).
CK *qle- 'penis': Georg, qle- 'penis'; Megr. 'ole-; Laz qole-, ole-, kole-; Svan [ql—].
Possibly Common Kartvelian archetype. The word-final vowel is regularly identical in Georgian and the Zan languages. Their Svan equivalent is compared with the Georgian-Zan material only tentatively: it

*qowl
is extracted from Svan qlaw 'child (boy)'. Of. the analogous semantic pattern under *kutu~. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Schmidt (1962: 141). Laz: £SKJa: 212.
GZ *qowl- 'all, every': Georg, qovel- 'every, any'; Megr. ir- 'every'; Laz ir-. The word is available in Old Georgian, where it meant also 'all, whole': ese qoveli migce sen 'all these things I give thee' Mt. 4.9. Cf. also Old Georgian qowl-ad 'completely, wholly'. The Zan reflex of the protoform greatly resembles the reflex of Common Kartvelian *tow-l-. Yet Bopp (1847:23) believed the initial consonant to have been lost in the Zan form. The reconstruction of the protoform is proposed in Gigineisvili (1984: 42-43). 1 1 Marr (1914: 89).
GZ *qown- 'to be late, tarry': Georg, qovn- 'to tarry, be late'; Laz \qon-] 'to wa'it'. The verb stem is well attested in Old Georgian (qovnida si$ej... 'the bridegroom tarried...' Mt. 25.5; action noun qovna-). In Laz the stem may be extracted from the derivative o-qond—in—u 'to delay', where an earlier stem-fused passive voice marker -d is identified. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 358).
GZ *qorq 'throat, gullet': Georg, qorq- 'throat, gullet'; Megr. qorqel-,
Georgian-Zan lexeme. The Megrelian correspondence contains an earlier evaluation suffix -el (cf. also *kud-). The word has a sound-symbolic character supported by similar forms available in this meaning in the North Caucasian languages as well as far beyond them (cf. Abx. a-qdrqs, Agul qurq, Finn, kurkku, etc.). | |Marr (1909: 0155-0156).
GZ *qoqo- 'calf of buffalo': Georg, qoqo- 'calf of buffalo'; Megr. yoyo-.' The Georgian continuant is attested in the Kartl. and Gur. dialects (yionti 1984: 594). For the phonetic correspondence Georg, q ~ Zan γ see *d(l)aqw—, *noqa-, ets. The reduplicated structure of the word may suggest its sound-symbolic nature. | | Klimov (1988: 162).

*qrt(w)- // qnt(w)
CK *qrt(w)- // qnt(w)- 'to swallow'; Megr. qirt-, qint- 'to swallow'; Svan r'tqw-, ntqw-.
A tentative reconstruction. Cf. nouns of action: Megr. qirtua-, (r)qintua-, Svan li-rtqw-i, li-ntqw-i. In one of the languages compared the consonant cluster underwent metathesis. In Georgian no reliable equivalent is found (cf. Schmidt 1962: 128). Some possible links see under *qarqant-.
CK *qu- 'to howl': Georg. qu(v)- 'to howl'; Svan q - 'to cry, howl'. A verb stem attested in Old Georgian: dga da quoda '(it) stood and howled', cf. the action noun quil- (Abula3e 1973: 469). The stem belongs to the descriptive formations with a suffix —il. The Svan action noun is li—q -1—i. Cf. —qur—.
j | Sardschweladse (1985: 25).
GZ *qua- 'handle of an axe': Georg, qua 'handle of an axe; crust of bread'; Megr. Ήα-; Laz qva-, kva- 'forehead'; Svan qu(w)a 'handle' (?). The correspondence Georg, u ~ Zan v remains unclear since more often one can see the reverse (cf. *arwa-, *swe-, *kwa-). In Megrelian its phonetic variant 'να- 'forehead' its attested. Laz (Xopa dial.) quomeans 'handle of hoe'. In general the meaning 'handle' is considered to be original: cf. Common Kartvelian *subl- 'forehead'. The word may be
somehow connected with PIE *kou- : ku- 'to beat; forge' with a particular resemblance to Slav, kova 'handle of an axe'. | | Megrelian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 30). Georgian: Cikobava (1938: 49). Svan: USKJa: 213.
GZ *qud- 'to put against; to stick': Georg, qud- 'to put against'; Megr. [W-]'. The verb stem is attested with a number of its derivatives in Old Georgian. Cf. its action noun daqudeba- which has a secondary meaning 'calming' (cf. qudro- 'quiet, calm'). In Megrelian this stem may be extracted from its nominal derivative 'ud-e 'house' (cf. Cikobava (1938:
19).
GZ *qud-e 'house': Georg, [qude-] 'house'; Megr. 'ude-. Unattested in Old Georgian. It seems to be a noun formation in -e based on the verb stem *qud-. Contrary to Megrelian where the word is widely in use, the Georgian equivalent may be extracted from its
245



*qu(n)c
derivative sa-qud-el- 'cloister, refuge' (cf. also Georg. kva~qude- 'stone house'). In Laz their cognate remains unknown.
GZ *qu(n)c- 'to squat': Georg, qunc- 'to squat'; Megr. 'HC-. Georgian-Zan verb stem. In the Lecx. dialect of Georgian the verb means 'to fidget (sitting)'. Cf. yionti (1984: 616). In Megrelian the stem underwent regular change q > '. Its action noun is 'MC—/'«—. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1985: 25).
GZ *qur- 'ear': Georg, qur 'ear; edge'; Megr. '113- 'ear'; Laz
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian texts (carhkueta quri misi... 'smote off his ear...' Mt. 26.52; cf. the compound qurimal'cheek'). It underlies such Georgian-Zan derivatives as *qur—u— 'deaf and *qur-c- 'eye of needle'. The connection sometimes proposed with Svan qör 'door, yard' remains semantically problematic. For the correspondence Georg.-Zan u ~ Svan o see *ttwe-, *subl-, etc. 1 1 Rosen (1845: 30).
GZ *qur- 'to howl' (of wolves, dogs): Georg, [qur-] 'to howl' (of wolves, dogs); Megr. 'i/r-; Laz (q)ur-, qu(r)- 'to cry; be angry'. In Georgian the verb stem may be extracted only from the reduplicative formation qurqul- with the same meaning and showing the dissimilation of r in the second syllable. The Megrelian action noun is 'urua-, 'urap-. The Laz cognate (cf. qu(r)aps '(it) howls') underwent a semantic shift. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 359). Georgian: Sardschweladse (1985: 25).
GZ *qurs- 'to become dumb; be silent': Georg, qurs- 'to become dumb'; Megr. 'urs- 'to become dumb; be silent'. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. The forms are hardly connected with Georg.-Zan *qur- 'ear'. The Megrelian verb may be a Georgian loanword (cf. action nouns Georg, qursva-, Megr. 'ursua-). \ | Fähnrich (1984: 44).
GZ *qurs,- 'to load oneself (heavily)': Georg, qurs- 'to load oneself (heavily)'; Megr. 'urs- 'to get drunk'. Unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language the verb stem occurs in dialects (yionti 1984: 193). The phonetic correspondence is
246



*qur-u
regular. The meaning of the Megrelian stem must be secondary and emerged in the metaphoric use of the protoform. | | Fähnrich (1984: 44).
GZ *qur-u- 'deaf, dumb': Georg, qru- 'deaf, dumb'; Megr. 'uru- 'silly'. The adjective is well known in Old Georgian : brmaj da qruj... 'blind and deaf...' Mt. 12.22 (cf. its derivative qruoba- 'silence'). It is a derivative from *qur- formed by the privative suffix *-u. In Georgian the stem underwent syncope. ||Cf. Topuria(1979:78).
GZ *qur-c- 'ear of the needle': Georg, qunc- 'ear of the needle; cutting'; Megr. qurc-. Attested in Old Georgian in the secondary form kurc- (cf. Abula3e 1973: 206) showing the change q > k. Cf. also dialectal Western Georgian qurc- (yionti 1984: 617). It is a derivative from *qur- 'ear' extended by the unproductive diminutive suffix *-c. In the past one considered the Megrelian word to have been borrowed from Georgian (cf. Kipsidze 1914: 355). Similar Svan kwirc- with the same meaning goes back to Georgian source. Relation of Laz kukunc- 'cutting, graft; tip' remains unclear.
CK *quq- 'to squat': Georg, quq- 'to squat'; Svan qqw-. Verb stem of sound-symbolic nature. In Georgian it is part of dialectal vocabulary (cf. yionti 1984:194). Action nouns are Georg, da-quq-ebaand Svan li-qqw-e.
1 1 Fähnrich (1984: 44).
GZ *§e- 'into' (preverb): Georg, se- 'into' (preverb); Megr. sa-; Laz s(k)a-, ska-.
Widely used in Old Georgian texts (seved misal 'Go in unto her!' Gen. 39.3). The expected Zan correspondence is found in the Atina dialect of Laz, where it forms part of the complex preverbs me—ska and e—ska. In the rest of the Zan area it is simplified (cf.Megr. mi-sa-dguma- 'to put in', mi-sa-lapa- 'to fall into'). Cf. also the preverb ca- 'inside and down'
247



*sed-:sd
< sta- < se-da-. Ultimately the preverb can go back to the noun sowa-, as does the Svan adverb sga 'into, within'. 1 1 Gamqrelise (1959: 56-57). Cf. also Deeters (1930: 14).
CK *Sed-: Sd- 'to be proper': Megr. skid- 'to be proper'; Svan sged-: sgd'to deem smth. worthy'. In Georgian the verb stem seems to be unattested. While the Megrelian form reflects only a zero grade (cf. Megrelian action noun skidir-), the Svan forms preserve both ablaut grades (the Svan action noun is li-sgd-e).
1 1 Cf. Topuria (1979: 10).
CK *Sew-: Sw- 'to give birth; to beget'; Georg, sv- 'to give birth'; Megr. sk(v)- 'to lay eggs (of birds)'; Laz sk(v)-; Svan [sg-] 'to be born'. Verb stem amply represented in Old Georgian, where the ablaut alternation was still preserved (Abraham sva Isaki 'Abraham begat Isaak' Mt 1.12; v-sev Ί begot'). A semantic shift is found in the Zan form: cf. analogous dependence between Lit. peret 'to hatch eggs' and PIE *per'to give birth, to produce'. The derivatives *m-sw-e- and *sw-il- are formed from the stem. In Svan it can be extracted only from the continuation of the first of these. Its similarity to PIE *su-: seu- 'to bear, beget' seems accidental. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 31). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 315). Svan: Gamqre^e (1959: 59).
CK *Sw- 'to befit smb., be proper': Georg, sv- 'to befit smb., be proper'; Megr. sku- 'to decorate'; Laz msku- 'to impress by one's beauty, to be proud'; Svan sgw-, sgu- 'to befit smb.'. In Georgian the verb stem is attested only in ancient texts: semasus cxorebaj igi... 'For me life is proper...'; see (Cikobava 1942: 83). The Zan (action noun Megr. skveba—, Laz o—msk—ii) and Svan (action noun li—sgw-e) equivalents reflect Gamkrelidze's law. In the Laz cognate, initial m has been augmented. Among derivatives of the stem cf. *m—swen— 'beautiful'. | | Topuria (cf. IKE I, 1946: 80).
CK *Sw- 'to let somebody go; to leave': Georg, sv- 'to let somebody go; to leave'; Megr. sk(v)—\ Laz sk(v)—\ Svan [sgw-] 'to let somebody go; to send'. The stem is represented in Old Georgian (da miusvi mat... 'and let them go...' Bal. 97.16; action noun sueba-). For the Zan languages cf.
248



*swd
action noun Megr. e—skv—apa—, Laz me—skv—in—u. The probable Svan equivalent is found in the extended stem sgw-an— (action noun li—sgwari). The semantic field of the verb stem skw- 'to tie' could have prevented the operation of Gamkrelidze's law in the Zan-Svan area (cf. Gamqre^e 1959: 71). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: (Cikobava 1938: 366-367). Svan: USKJa: 214.
CK *Swd- 'to choke; to suffocate, be suffocated; to drown, get drown': Georg, xrc- 'to choke; to suffocate, to drown'; Megr. skvid-; Laz sk(v)id-, skid-; Svan sgwd- : sgud-.
The verb stem occurs as st(v)- in Old Georgian texts (daistves zyuasa mas sina... '(they) were choked in the sea...' Mk. 5.13; action noun stoba-, sdoba-; the form of the stem in sisudil— < si-sud—il— 'suffocation' is even more ancient). See Topuria (1979: 213). It is believed that the modern Georgian stem is formed by the augmentation of r to c < sd; the additional initial χ remains obscure (phonetical grounds are unlikely). The Zan (cf. action noun Megr. skvida-, Laz o-skvid-u) and Svan (action noun li-sgud-e) forms are affected by Gamkrelidze's law probably on account of counteraction of the semantic field of the stem *swed- : swd'to remain' (Gamqre^e 1979: 70). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 31). Laz: Marr (1811-1914 VII: 258). Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 20-21).
CK(?) *Swed- : Swd- 'to remain': Georg, rc- 'to remain'; Megr. skid-, skdd-; Laz skid-, skud-, sked- 'to live'; Svan sed- : sd-; sad- 'to remain'(?). The verb stem is widely attested in Old Georgian, where the ablaut alternation sed-: sd- was still preserved (dasda lesu... 'Jesus remained...' Sin. mr. 98.4; action noun sdoma-, stoma-, cf. also unregular derivative ne-st- 'remainder, posterity'). The modern Georgian form has arisen by hitherto unexplained augmentation of r to c < st < sd (cf. Topuria 1979: 38). The Zan and Svan reflexes (action nouns Megr. skilada—, Laz o—skid—u 'life', Svan li—sed) point to the former presence of w in the stem; at the same time g expected in Svan is lost (Gamqrelije 1959: 66-67). In Zan languages an irregular change k> k may occur. The Laz form underwent a shift in meaning. A former complexity of the stem is quite probable (cf. *sw- 'to let go; to leave'). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 61). Laz, Svan: Cikobava (1938:316-318).
249



*swel
GZ *Swel- 'roe, chamois': Georg, svel- 'roe, chamois'; Megr. skver-, skver—; Laz mskver—, pskver—, mskver— 'deer'.
The word is documented in the Georgian medieval literature. In modern Georgian a dialectal variant psvel- is found. The Zan cognates are affected by Gamkrelidze's law (cf. Gamqreli^e 1959: 27). The complex we is preserved here as elsewhere. Word-initial augmentations are typical of Laz. It has been suggested that the meaning of the Laz word is original (cf. Cikobava (1938: 91). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 74). Laz: Marr (1911-1914VI: 421).
CK *S(w)en- 'your (sing.)': Georg, sen- 'your (sing.)'; Megr. skan-; Laz skan-, ckan-; Svan isgwi, isgu.
The possessive pronoun is amply attested in Old Georgian texts ($eni senni da ... monagebi sent 'your sons and ... your household' Gen. 45.11). The Zan and Svan reflexes point to an ancient w preserved at present only in Svan (Gamqreh^e 1959: 36-37). The end of the Svan pronoun has been simplified, whereas its initial / is a prothetic vowel. M Rosen (1945: 411,421).
CK *§w-en-: §w-n- 'to decorate; to be proper, befit': Georg. Sven- 'to decorate; to be proper; to befit'; Megr. [skvam-]; Laz skvan-; Svan [sgwen-].
Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian (esre suenis cuenda 'it becometh us' Mt. 3.15; action noun sueneba-). It is derived from the simple base *sw- by adding the extension -en. Cf. its derivative sno'charm, fascination', which, according to Vogt (1938: 330), cannot stem from Arm. snorh 'charity, plenty'. The Laz continuant occurs in an unbound state: domoskvanu 'he decorated me'. It was subject to Gamkrelidze's law (cf. Gamqrelise 1959: 27). Stem-final m of the Megrelian form (action noun skvameba-) is owed to the adjective skvam- 'beautiful' marked by the word formation suffix -am. The Svan correspondence may be seen in the continuant of the stem *m-swen-. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 322). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 230). Svan: Topuria (IKE I, 1946: 80).
GZ *Swer-: 3wr- 'to get dry; to become dim': Georg, sr- 'to get dry'; Megr. skir-, skar-; Laz skir-, skur- 'to become dim'.
Verb stem. Its two derivatives were characterized in Old Georgian by substantial semantic differences: cf. action nouns sroba— 'to dry' and
250



*swid
suroma- 'to work, to get tired' (cf. daasro igi amboxi 'it muffled indignation' Sin.mr. 104.37; the verb-final points here to an earlier presence of w in the stem: daasro < da—a—srw-a). The cluster sk in the Zan forms (action noun Megr. skirapa-, Laz me—skir—u) calls for the same interpretation. According to Gamqreli3e (1959: 61-66) the full grade of this stem is reflected in the Old Georgian word-form da-v-suer-it 'we got tired'. Cf. also the derivative *sret- : *srit- : srt-. The similarity to Arm. sof 'dry, stale' seems to Acafyan (1977: 630) to be fortuitous. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 323). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 318-319).
CK *Swid— 'seven': Georgian svid— 'seven'; Megr. skvit—, Laz sk(v)it—\ Svan isgwid.
The numeral is amply known from Old Georgian texts (mat hrkues: svidi... 'they said, seven...' Mk. 8.5; cf. its derivatives swideul- 'week' and meswide- 'seventh'). Cf. also modern Georgian (Ing.) süd- (yionti 1984: 637). The Georgian and Svan lexemes point to the age of d in wordfinal position. Initial Svan / may be explained either as a prothetic vowel (Zyenti 1949: 189) or as an argument in favor of the archetype *s(i)wid-. Bopp (1847: 38-39) reconstructed here *siwd-, comparing it with PIE *septm-. However, a closer relationship of the word to Akkad. sibit 'seven' is quite evident (for the rendering of the Sem. b cf. *arwa- 'eight'). | | Rosen (1845: 11).
GZ *Sw-il- 'born': Georg, svil- 'child'; Megr. [ski-, skil-]·, Laz skir-, skir-.
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian (ora esua mat svili 'they had no son' Lk. 1.7, where a number of its derivatives are available). It is formed from the verbal stem *sew- : sw- by the participle affix *-i7. In modern Georgian the dialectal variants sül- and sul- are found (cf. yionti 1984: 637). The Zan forms skir—, skil— basically correspond to the Georgian, although original w is here lost and the irregular change k > k may take place. In Megrelian the lexeme survives vestigially: cf. the compound oxora-skil- 'brother-in-law, sister-in-law'. Rosen (1845: 11). Cf. also Marr (1911-1914 VI: 421).
GZ *S(w)in- 'to frighten, get frightened': Georg, sin- 'to frighten, fear'; Megr. (r)skin-, ckin- 'to frighten'.
251



*si(n)d
Verb stem well known in Old Georgian (nu gesinia matgan Tear them not' Mt. 10.26; action noun sineba-, sis- < *si-s- 'fear'). The Megrelian form (action noun skinapa-) regularly corresponds to the Georgian one. An early appearance of initial inorganic r is also a precondition of action of Gamkrelidze's law. 1 1 Rogava (1956: 83).
GZ *Si(n)d- 'cornel': Georg, sind-, svind- 'cornel'; Laz [skid-]. The lexeme is not attested in Old Georgian. The forms sind- and sundare used in dialects (cf. ylonti 1984: 632, 637). The Laz equivalent seems to have survived in the microtoponym Skidona-, literally 'cornel grove' (its s points to the later emergence of v in Georgian). 1 1 Memisisi (1988: 90-91).
CK *Sowa- 'middle; in the middle': Georg, sua- 'middle; between'; Megr. ska- ska-; Laz ska-, ska- 'waist'; Svan isg(a) 'between'.
The lexeme is found in the form suwa—, sowa— in Old Georgian {da iqo suwa yames oden... 'when it was midnight...' Ruth 3.8). The Svan equivalent reflects the operation of Gamkrelidze's law, due to an early contact of w with s (Gamqrelije 1959: 51-54). Its word-initial / is a prothetic vowel. The semantic relatedness of the forms is beyond doubt. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 74). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 68). Svan: Topuria (1979: 10).
CK(?) *§or- 'Rhododendron ponticum': Megr. sker-,psker- 'Rhododendron ponticum'; Laz {m)sker-, msker-, psker-; Svan sgöri.
Unattested in Old Georgian. According to Schmidt (1961: 152), West Georgian dialectal (Gur. and Imer.) forms sker-, sker— have been borrowed from a Zan source. A transition o > ö > e is assumed for the Zan forms (cf. *yor- 'swine'). There remains a possibility that Svan sgöri is also a Zan loanword. | | Megrelian, Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 10). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 131).
GZ *Sr-et- : §r-it- : §r-t- 'to extinguish': Georg, sret- : srit- 'to extinguish, get extinguished; to exhaust, evaporate'; Megr. skirat- : skirit'to extinguish, get extinguished'. The verb stem is well represented in Old Georgian texts, where the zero grade was still in use {dausrta cecxli twisi 'extinguished his fire' Sin. mr. 261.7; action noun sreta-; usret- 'unextinguishable'). According to
252



*srek-il
(1959: 65), it must be viewed as a derivative from the simple base *§wer- : swr- with the suffix *-et (< *-ed). Its Georgian and Zan continuants point to an early loss of the former w. Georgian apophonic derivative srat- 'whey, serum' is the source of Arm. srat with the same meaning. Cf. Acaryan (1977: 543). 1 1 Cagareli (1880: 61). Cf. also Caraia (1895 XII: 112).
GZ *Srek-il- 'extinct': Georg, [sret-il-] 'extinct'; Megr. skimtil-. A past participle in -i7 based on the verb stem *sret- : srit- : srt-. In Old Georgian it is reflected in da-sretil- with the same meaning (Abula3e 1973: 131). The cognates regularly match each other phonetically.
CK *§ubl- 'forehead; front part': Georg, subl- 'forehead'; Megr. skibu-, skobu- 'millstone'; Laz mskibu-, pskibu- 'mill'; Svan [sgob-, sgweb-] 'front part'. Attested in Old Georgian (daicera guari sublsa... 'crossed his forehead...' Krest. 161.17). In Zan and Svan the word is affected by Gamkrelidze's law. For the correlation Georg. / ~ Zan u cf *opl-, *cqintl-. Initial m or p in the Laz forms is secondary. The Svan match may be identified in the derivative sgobin, sgwebin 'in front of, forward'. The Zan cognates have undergone a semantic shift. Their relation to the archetype remains somewhat in doubt. Cf. Penrixi-Sar|vela3e (1990: 381 and 384). 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Marr (1911: 1203). Megrelian, Laz: T. Gudava.
CK *Sur- 'to be in an awkward situation; fear': Georg, sur- 'to envy'; Megr. skur- 'to fear'; Laz skur-, skur-; Svan sgur- 'to be ashamed'. Since the semantic alternation 'to fear' —'to be ashamed' is attested in some other languages, only the connection of the Georgian verb with the reconstructed stem remains somewhat problematic (note the Old Georgian action noun sureba- [Abula3e 1973: 509] and Georg, m—sur—s Ί envy'). With a meaning 'fear' the stem is found in Megr. mo-skur-u Ί fear', Lazma-skur-in-u Ί got frightened'. Cf.also Svan mi-sgur Ί am ashamed, I am in an awkward situation' (action noun li—sgwr-in—e). | | Zan, Svan: Schmidt (1962: 144). Georgian: Klimov (1985: 176).
CK *Sur- 'shame, envy': Georg, sur- 'envy'; Megr. [skur-]; Laz [skur-]; Svan sgur, sgwir 'shame'. It is a nominal correlate of the identical verb stem. In the Xevs. dialect the Georgian lexeme means 'hatred'. In the languages of the Zan branch the
253



*surdun
stem can be extracted only from the parallel verbal formations (see the preceding entry). The Svan cognate sgwir reflects a regular trace of umlaut. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Fähnrich (1980: 73).
GZ *§urdun- 'sling': Georg, surdul- 'sling'; Megr. skurdon- 'catapult'. A lexeme well represented in Old Georgian texts, where its derivative surdlosan- 'thrower from sling' is found (Abula3e 1973: 508-509). The reconstruction of the word-final part remains tentative. It is tempting to think of a connection of the lexeme with Georg.-Zan *mswild- 'bow'. 1 1 Rogava (1962: 98).
CK(?) *§xep- 'to splash': Georg, sxep- 'to splash, lap'; Megr. cxap- 'to splash'; Laz cxap-; Svan cxp-(?). An onomatopoeic verb stem (cf. the expressive p in its end), which accounts for the diversity in the structure of the initial consonant cluster. For the Zan form the process sx > ex must be admitted. Contrary to Laz (action noun o-cxap-u) the Megrelian stem is extended by an affixal element (action noun cxap-al-). The genetic pairing of the Georgian-Zan material and Svan base cxp- (action noun li-cxp-e 'to splash') is somewhat problematic.
GZ *§xwert— 'to be refined, elegant': Georg, sxvert— 'refined, elegant, slender'; Megr. sxvart- 'to look elegant; to wear clothes elegantly'. Verb stem apparently unattested in Old Georgian. The correlation of the vocalism is regular. The Georgian dialectal (Gur.) adjective sxvart'elegant' (ylonti 1984: 638) must be viewed as a Zan loanword. A denominative origin of the Megrelian verb stem (action noun sxvartua-) is also plausible.
GZ *ian-: in- 'to be seen': Georg, can-: en- 'to be seen; to seem'; Megr. ckun—, ckin— 'to know; to suppose'; Laz skun—, ckin—. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (bnelsa sina cans 'shines in the darkness' Jn. 1.5). In modern Georgian the historical ablaut alternation serves to distinguish the lexical meaning: cf. en- 'to suppose, believe'. In

*c(w)em
the Zan languages the zero grade is regularly reflected as / (cf. the Megrelian action noun ckina- 'to know'). In Laz spirantization of c can be assumed. The Zan forms underwent a semantic deviation. || Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 311, 364). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 378).
CK *i(w)em- 'my': Georg, cem- 'my'; Megr. ckim-\ Laz ckim-, skim-; Svan [sgwi; sgu].
Well attested in Old Georgian texts (dedaj cemi... 'my mother...' Mt. 12.48), where a variant cejm— also occurs. In Laz a form with s is characteristic of the Atina dialect. Georgian-Zan material presupposes an intermediate protoform *cem-. The Svan equivalent is represented in the pronoun mi-sgwi, mi-sgu 'me', where mi- seems to be another element pointing to the first person. The Svan cognate permits one to reconstruct *cwem—.

GZ *6en-: 5in- 'to make visible': Georg, den- : ein- 'to make visible; to create'; Megr. (r)ckin- 'to establish, create'; Laz clan-. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (...gamogacinebs sen '...(it) bewrayeth thee' Mt. 26.73). It is related with *can- : en—. In Georgian both ablaut grades are preserved. Its Megrelian equivalent may contain a secondary extension r. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 88). Laz: Macavariani (1961: 258).
GZ *£er£- 'chaff': Georg, cere- 'chaff, rind'; Megr. [ckarck-]. In Georgian it is a dialectal (Raca) word (yionti 1984: 653). Its Megrelian correspondence is absent as a substantive, but may be extracted from the verb stem ckarck-al- 'to grind (roughly)'. 1 1 F hnrich (1982: 37).
CK *£e£w- : έ£>ν- 'to soften': Georg, cv- 'to soften'; Megr. ckick-ar-; Svan [%w-]. Verb stem well known in Old Georgian with two c (moacco guli cemi '(he) softened my heart' Gen. 23.16; action noun moccueba-). The Megrelian stem contains a later affixal element (action noun ckickarua-). Their Svan correspondence may be discerned in the derivative me-sgw-e
255



*ceck
'soft'. The change c > s may have occurred here when Gamkrelidze's law had already ceased to operate (Gamqreli3e 1959: 20, 42). 1 1 Gamqreli3e (ibidem). Cf. £SKJa: 221.
GZ *£e£k- 'to hollow; to break': Georg, ceck- 'to hollow; to pound'; Megr. ckack- 'to break (an apple); to split'; Laz cack- 'to pound'. Verb stem represented in Old Georgian texts: action noun (da)ceckuva- (Abulase 1973: 512; Sar$vela3e 1995: 72). It may have an onomatopoeic origin. The second k in the Megrelian form (action noun ckackua- alongside Laz o-cack-u) emerged not as a result of regular phonetic development, but in view of the reduplication rule of the back element in structures like *titx-wn-, *tutk-, etc. | | N. Natadze (IKE XI, 1959: 131).
GZ *iw(e)- 'to get accustomed; to train, school': Georg, eve-, cvi- 'to get accustomed; to train, school'; Megr. rckv(a)-; Svan ckw- 'to get accustomed'(?). The verb stem is attested in Old Georgian (cueul iqo mtavari igi 'governor was wont' Mt. 27.15). The Megrelian form corresponds basically to the Georgian one. Only the initial r remains unclear (action noun rckvana-). A similar Svan form (action noun li-ckw-n-e) seems to be a Zan borrowing. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: G. Dumezil (1933: 88). Cf. also Vogt (1947.1: 55). Svan: Fähnrich (1982: 37).
CK *£wen 'we': Georg, even 'we'; Megr. cki, cka; Laz ckun, ckin, sku; Svan [sgwej].
In the form cuen the personal pronoun is attested in Old Georgian (cuen guesma magisi sitquaj 'we heard his words' Mk. 14.58). In the Megrelian form the end of the stem is reduced. The Svan correspondence may be extracted from the secondary possessive formations gu-sgwej Our (inclusive)' and ni-sgwej Our (exclusive)'. The latter forms prove that the earliest Kartvelian pronoun was neutral to an inclusive ~ exclusive opposition. || Georgian, Zan: Bopp (1847: 25), Rosen (1847: 411). Svan: Gamqreh'3e (1959:
CK *dwen- Our': Georg, even- Our'; Megr. ckin-, ckan-; Laz ckun-, ckin-, skun-, skin-; Svan [sgwej].
256



*cig-wn
Amply represented in Old Georgian (mamaman cuenman... Our Father...' Gen. 44.27). For the Zan forms the variation in the vocalism is typical. In Svan the stem is identified in the personal pronouns mentioned in the preceding entry. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 63). Svan: &SKJa: 220.
GZ *6ig-wn- 'to cut, chop off': Georg. cig(v)n- 'to cut, chop off'; Megr. cigon—.
In all probability the verb stem contains the word-forming suffix *-wn, although the underlying verb base does not occur on its own. In Megrelian (action noun cigonua-) the initial c does not develop the expected k since the stem already has one back consonant. | | Fähnrich (1982: 37).
CK(?) *£iqw- 'goitre': Georg, ciqv- 'goitre'; Megr. ciqv-, ciqvaqv-;
• * ...
Svan qwiqw, quqw, qwic.
Sound-symbolic word (cf. Lak cuh, Darg, civh 'crop of bird'). Its place in the history of Kartvelian languages is difficult to establish. In view of the substantial divergence of the data in phonetics the reconstruction of a protoform remains tentative. The Svan forms may reflect regressive assimilation. At the same time they are closer to Megr. qveqvere- 'a man with hurt expression of the face' and i—qviqv—in—an—s '(he) looks hurt'. The Svan qwic seems to be a loanword. 1 1 £SKJa: 220.
GZ *oi£k-wn- 'to dig in, rummage in': Georg, cickn- 'to dig in, rummage in'; Megr. ckickon— 'to dig in, rummage in; to eat poorly'. The forms contain an earlier suffix *-wn attached to the root *ceck'to hollow; to split'. The additional Megr. k is likely to have resulted not from regular development, but from reduplication of the back element in the first syllable. | | USKJa: 220.
GZ *in-d- 'to appear, emerge': Georg, end- 'to appear, emerge'; Megr. (r)ckind—; Laz ckind—.
A merging of the stem *cen— : en— with the passive marker —d. The form is documented in Old Georgian (da araraj gamocnda 'and nothing has appeared' Gen. 41.21). The Zan stem regularly corresponds to the Georgian one. Megr. r is secondary. The Laz cognate (cf. mtuti—ti ek keckindu 'and the bear appeared here' <? 3, 42.21) shows a clear trace of
257



*cum
the passive suffix -d. Evidently this suffix merged with the simple stem at a very early stage. 1 1 Deeters (1930: 205).
GZ(?) *ium- 'to calm down': Georg, cum- 'to calm down, fall silent; quiet'; Svan ckwim 'quiet, calm'. A difficult stem. It might belong to the Common Kartvelian period (Georgian action noun dacumeba-), however the Svan form is likely to be an ancient borrowing from the Zan languages (cf. its word-initial cluster representing a typical Zan continuant of the Common Kartvelian *c). Therefore an assignment of the form to the Georgian-Zan inheritance seems preferable. | | Fähnrich (1982: 37).
GZ *6kal—: Ckl— 'to tear into pieces': Georg, ckl-et— 'to tear into pieces'; Megr. ckol- 'to tear, break'. Unattested in Old Georgian. The modern Georgian continuant is extended by an affixal element -et (action noun ckleta-). The Megrelian action noun is ckolua-. The forms reflect different ablaut grades. 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 37).
GZ *<ikep- 'to well up, purl; to be agitated': Georg, ckep- 'to well up, purl; to be agitated'; Megr. chap-. Verb stem represented in Old Georgian in the shape of ckuep-: ckuepda gonebaj cemi... 'my mind was agitated', action noun ckuepa(Abulase 1973: 513). Cf. also the adverb m-ckuep-r 'at once; immediately' (its forms without r occur in Rustaveli 405,2 and 1318,3). For modern Georgian cf. mckepare- 'welling up, seething' and a dialectal (Imer.) ckep— 'waterfall'. In Megrelian the stem is reflected in the adjective ckap— (evidently formed from m-ckap—} 'bubbling, welling up'.
GZ *£Cw—il— 'soft (of animate objects), tender': Georg, evil— 'tender, soft'; Megr. ckicku-, ckackd-; Laz cicku-, cucku-.
Apparently an earlier past participle based on the stem *cecw- : ccw-. The word is well attested in Old Georgian in the shape of ccuil— {...da moiba qboj ccvili '... and (he) took a tender calf Gen. 18.7), where it used to mean 'new-born, new-born child'. This comparison shows the correspondence Georg, (v)// ~ Zan u in word-final position (cf. *msixw-il-, *srsw-il-).
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 86).Laz: Cikobava (1938: 242).
258



*cxam
GZ *£xam- 'fish': Georg, cxama- 'small fish'; Megr. cxom- 'fish'; Laz cxom-, ncxom-.
In Old Georgian seems to be unattested. In modern Georgian it is a dialectal (Upp. Imer.) word, which contains a later diminutive suffix -a. The Zan lexeme regularly corresponds to its Georgian cognate. | | Megrelian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 29). Georgian: Vogt (1954: 543), Fähnrich (1985: 25).
CK *£xartw— 'magpie': Georg, cxartv— 'magpie'; Svan cxurust, cxzrist, cxirwist.
Lost in the Zan languages (if Megr. jyarjya- is not its radical transformation). The age of the word may be indicated by the correspondence Georg, t ~ Svan St >st. Reduplicated Georg, kackac- 'magpie' must be an onomatopoeic innovation. The word contains a descriptive cluster ex (cf. *fcrcx-, *cxikw-).
' | | Fähnrich (1985: 28).
CK *£xeb- : £xb- 'to entangle, interlace': Georg, cxib- 'to interlace'; Svan sxeb- : sxb- 'to sew'. A verb stem lacking in the Zan languages. It occurs in Old Georgian (cf. action noun cxibva- and its derivative mcxibav- 'sorceress'). The vocalism of the Georgian form remains unclear. In Svan (action noun li-sxb-i) the word-initial consonant is spirantized. 1 1 Rogava (IKE IV, 1952: 47).
GZ *£x-ek- 'to shake down (by pole)': Georg, cxek- 'to shake down (by pole)'; Laz [ncxak-]. In Georgian the verb stem is now a dialectal (Imer.) item: cf. action noun cxekva- (ylonti 1984: 668). Its Zan equivalent may be extracted from the Laz nominal derivative o-ncxak-al-e 'pole for shaking down nuts', which has developed a secondary n. The variant of the latter word o-ncxrak-al-e supports the historical identity of the stem with the base *cxr-ek— : cxr-k-.

CK *ixer— : ixir— : ixr- 'to pick (with stick)': Georg, cxer— : cxir 'to pick (with stick)'; Megr. [cxir-]; Laz [cxir-], Svan [cxir-]. Its Old Georgian continuant is attested in the action noun dacxera- and in the past participle dacxeril- (Abulaje 1973: 132). In the Zan languages

*cxw
it can be discerned in the reflexes „ of the derivatives *cxir- and *cxr-ek- : cxr-k-.
||KJimov(1973:365).
GZ *Cxw- 'to prick, pierce': Georg. \cxv(l)-} 'to prick, pierce'; Megr. [cx(v)-\- Laz [cx(v)-}.
In the modern languages the stem does not occur in an unbound state. The Georgian-Zan derivative *cxw(l)-et- : *cxw(l)-it- 'to prick; whip up' contains an extension *-et. In Old Georgian the stem is attested in its derivative action noun cxuepa— 'to stab, to sting' with an expressive p in the affix 1973: 514).
GZ *&twe(r)k- 'brushwood': Georg, cxverk- 'dry brushwood'; Megr. [cxvak-]; Laz cxverk 'dry bough'.
In Georgian the word is represented by a dialectal (Gur.) form for 'dry brushwood; twigs'. The Megrelian correspondence is preserved as a loanword in the same Georgian dialect in the verb cxvakva- 'to wattle a fence' (yionti 1984: 668). The vocalism of the Laz cognate seems to be a result of umlaut of a. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1987: 22).
GZ *5xw(l)-et- : £xw(l)-it- 'to prick; to whip': Georg, cxvlet: cxvlit- 'to prick, to stick into'; Megr. cxvat-, cxvit- 'to whip; to prick'. In Old Georgian the stem is attested in the derivative sa-cxvlet-el'point of arrow' (Abulage 1973: 378). Its Megrelian cognate with the vocalism a is attested in the past participle form cxvat-il- 'cut'; cf. also the action nouns cxvatua— (intrans.). cxvitua— (trans.). The relation to the Megrelian and Laz stem cxot- 'to scratch; to wound slightly' and 'to card hemp' respectively seems admissible. | | Cf. USKJa: 222.
GZ *£xw(I)et-il- 'pricked, pierced': Georg, [cxvletil-] 'pricked, pierced'; Megr. cxvatil-.
Unattested in Old Georgian sources. It is a past participle in —il based on the verb stem *cxwl-et : cxwl-it- 'to prick, pierce'. The Georgian form may be extracted from the modern participle ga-cxvletil- with the same meaning.
260



*cxikw
GZ *£xikw- 'jay': Georg, cxikv- 'jay'; Megr. cxvik-; Laz cxvik-. In Old Georgian the lexeme occurs in the shape of cxiku- (Abula3e 1973: 531). It seems to have a descriptive character (cf. verb stem *krcx-). The Zan correspondence underwent a kind of metathesis. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 195).
CK *£xir- 'stick': Georg, cxir- 'stick'; Megr. [cxing-]; Svan cxir, cxir. A nominal correlate of the verb stem *cxer— : cxr- derived by apophonic word formation. The word occurs in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 515). The expected Megrelian continuant is reflected in the Abxaz borrowing a-cxanc, a-cxang 'stick fixed above the hearth'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Abaev (1958: 297). Svan: Klimov (1973: 365).
GZ *dxr—ek- : dxr—ik— : ixr—k— 'to pick (with stick)'; Georg, cxrek— : cxrik— 'to pick with stick'; Megr. cxirk—\ Laz cxrak-. Verb stem derived from the simple base *cxer- : cxr-. It is attested in Old Georgian: action noun cxreka-, participle mcxrekal- 'scratching' (Abulase 1973: 306, 514). Whereas the Megrelian correspondence reflects historical zero grade of the stem (cf. action noun cxirkua-), the Laz form continues its full grade (action noun o-cxrak-u; cf. also o-ncxrak-al-e- 'pole for shaking off nuts'). The similar Svan form (action noun li-cxark-e 'to sew poorly') is likely to have been borrowed from the Zan source. I I USKJa: 222.
CK *ca- 'sky': Georg, ca- 'sky'; Megr. ca-\ Laz (m)ca-; (n)ca- 'sky, palate'; Svan [ca-}. Widely documented in Old Georgian (caman mosca cwima 'the sky gave rain' Kat. ep. 50.18; cf. its derivatives ze-ca- 'sky', cis-kar'dawn'). The dialectal (Lecx.) rca- must be secondary. In the Laz cognates the nasals may be augmented. The Svan equivalent is attested in the form cä-s 'Thursday', literally Of the sky' (genitive case). The reconstructions *caw- // cam- (Marr 1914: 92) and *cxa- (Tseretheli 1959: 96) cannot be accepted. 1 1 Rosen (1845: 34).
261



*cad- : cd
GZ *cad- : cd- 'to toil, labor; to endeavor': Georg, cad- : cd- 'to endeavor; trouble oneself; Megr. [cod-}. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian: cf. the action noun cda(Abula3e 1973: 514). In Georgian two ablaut grades have been preserved. In Megrelian the stem may be extracted from the derivative codil'endeavor, effort'. 1 1 F hnrich (1982: 37).
GZ *cal- 'part, piece': Georg, col- 'piece, one'; Laz co(r)- 'piece'. In Old Georgian the word is attested by the derivatives cal-tual- Oneeyed', cal-qel- One-armed' (Abulase 1973: 514). The phonetic correspondence of forms as well as their semantic proximity is beyond doubt.
GZ *car- : cr- 'to sift; to disperse': Georg, cer- : cr- 'to sift, disperse'; Megr. cir- 'to sift'; ncor- 'to jump (with ease)'; Laz near-: (n)cir- 'to sift'. Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (gamogitxovna ... aycrad '(he) wanted ... to sift you' Lk. 22.31; action noun era-). If Zan / reflects the old zero grade, the correlation Georg, e - Zan ο may go back to etymological α (cf. Macavariani 1959: 265 sqq), preserved as such in Georgian ηα-car- 'ashes': While the Laz forms are regional phonetic variants, the Megrelian forms differ semantically. The Kartvelian stem can hardly derive from Arm. c'rel 'to disperse'. Cf. Acaryan (1979: 456-457). | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 384). Another analysis of the Megrelian data in Sardschweladse (1973: 520).
CK *caj- 'elm': Megr. ci-, c&- 'elm'; Svan caj-ra, cah-ra. In Georgian no certain cognate is found. The original quality of the word-final consonant requires clarification, so that the reconstruction remains in this part tentative. The Svan match contains the affix denoting plants (cf. *(h)ad-, *na$w-, *cip- and *^acjov-). | |Marr (1911-1914 II: 837).
GZ *cel- 'scythe': Georgian eel- 'scythe'; Megr. eel-. A technical term represented in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 514). In the Megrelian word the expected a became e due to the umlaut (see the verb stem *cel-; cf also Megr. berg- 'hoe' alongside barg- 'to hoe', gen'calf' alongside gan- 'to feed a calf before milking a cow' and other
262



*cel
analogical pairs). In the past the age of the lexeme in Megrelian has been called in question. Cf. (^avaxisvili 1934:91). | | Cf. iSKJa: 223.
GZ *cel- 'to mow': Georg, eel- 'to mow'; Megr. eel-; Laz (n)cal-, (m)cal— 'to cut into pieces'. Verb stem, attested in Old Georgian texts forms a typical fragment of the agricultural terminology uniting Georgian and the Zan languages (action noun Georg, celva-, Megr. calua-, Laz o—ncal-u). The Georgian form has also been compared with cal- 'straw' (Schmidt 1961: 151), found both in Georgian and Zan. Sometimes the stem has been considered a denominative. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Dzanasvili (1902: 24).All material is aligned in Schuchardt (1902.2:394).
CK *cel- : cl- 'to peel, strip off': Georg, cal- : cl- 'to peel; to come off'; Megr. rc(v)-(?); Svan eel- : cl- 'to tear, strip off'. A verb stem well attested in Old Georgian: cf. action noun cla(Abula^e 1973: 517). It represents an example of the non-functional alternation of e and a in Kartvelian roots. Consonant metathesis cl > re is rather likely in the Megrelian stem (action noun rcuala-}. For Svan cf. the action nouns li-cel (intrans.), li-cl-e (trans.) and the derivative noun formation oil 'bark, rind, peel'. | | Georgian, Megrelian (ESKJa: 225).
GZ *cec- 'to walk fumblingly; to grope one's way'; Georg, cec- 'to walk fumblingly; to grope one's way'; Megr. cac-. Unattested in Old Georgian. A relation of this form, showing soundsymbolic coloring, to Georg, cacia- 'left-handed' remains obscure although it cannot be excluded. Megrelian action noun is cacap-, cacua-. No Laz cognate seems to exist. | Fähnrich (1982: 37).
GZ *ceck- 'to pull down; to break': Georg, ceck- 'to pull down'; Megr. ckack- 'to pull down; to break'.
To be compared with *3e$g-, *ceck-, ceck-, ceck-, ^e$g-. The development of the second k in the Megrelian form is regular. The stem underlies the Georgian-Zan derivative *cick—wn-. | | Fähnrich (1982: 37).
263



*cex
GZ *cex- 'to remove stubble': Georg, cex- 'to remove stubble'; Megr. cox- 'to grind; to crush'. A verb stem represented in Old Georgian: cf. its derivative sa-cexu-el'mowing board' (Abulase 1973: 378). It is one of the agricultural terms uniting Georgian with Zan languages (Megrelian action noun caxua-). Its connection with Laz (n)cax— 'to caulk' seems to be very disputable. Svan li-cexw-e 'to mow' is an obvious Georgian borrowing (parallel Svan li-cx-un-e must be a later formation). | | Schmidt (1961: 152).
CK *cw- 'to put on; to string': Georg, cv- 'to put on; to string'; Megr. cun—\ Laz cun—, con—; Svan cw-.
Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian texts (seacut becedi.A 'put a ring..!' Lk. 15.22). It underlies an extended stem *cw-am- : cw-m-. The Zan cognates are extended by an «, the nature of which requires clarification. For the Svan correspondence cf. the word-form x-a-cu-d-a 'he had (something) on'. The stem is used in the forms of the aoristic tenses. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 383). Svan: USKJa: 226.
CK *cwal- : cwl- 'to change, replace': Georg, cval-. cvl- 'to change, replace'; Svan cad-. A verb stem widely documented in Old Georgian: cf. action nouns gancvla- 'to replace', cvaleba- 'to change' (Abulase 1973: 515-516). No certain Zan match seems to exist. The lengthening of the stem vocalism in Svan (cf. lo-x-cad-e 'he replaced') compensates for the loss of w.

CK *cw-am-: cw-m- 'to put on; to hoist on': Georg, cvam- : cm- 'to put on; to string'; Svan cwem- 'to shoulder'. Verb stem well known in Old Georgian (guars-cuma seni 'thy crucifixion' Jn. 19.16; action noun cuma-). It is derived from the simple base *cw— by the addition of the thematic suffix *—am : —m. In the Svan form (action noun li—cwem) this suffix always shows e vocalism. The stem characterizes the presentic set of verbal tenses. Topuria (1979: 195) considered the Svan stem to have been borrowed from Georgian. | | Cf. USKJa: 223.
264



*cwar
GZ *cwar- 'to walk (hopping)': Georg, [cvar-] 'to walk (hopping)'; Megr. cor-, ncor- 'to hop, jump'. Unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language a continuant is found in a dialectal (Imer.) reduplicative formation cvar-cval- (cf. yionti 1984: 673)with a dissimilation r...r> r...l. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1973:520).
GZ *cwar- 'dew, drop of dew': Georg, cvar- 'dew'; Megr. cung-, cund-; Svan cwar 'drop' (?). The continuant is widely attested in Old Georgian: vitarca cuari ciskrisaj... 'like dew at daybreak...' Hos. 6.4 (cf. Abulaje 1973: 520), where it was used also to mean 'drop'. Whether the Svan lexeme is inherited remains unclear. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Riabinin (1897:21).
CK *cwem-: cwm- 'to smear': Georg, [cm-] 'to smear'; Megr. [dm-, csm-]; Laz [dm-]; Svan cwm— : cm-.
In Georgian and the Zan languages the verb stem may be extracted only from its derivatives (cf. *c(w)m-el- fat'). It is used in its unbound state only in Svan (action noun li-cw(m)-en-i). Cf. also Svan na-cm-un Ointment'.

CK(?) *c(w)m-el- 'fat': Georg, cmel- 'fat, mineral fertilizer'; Megr. cimu-, camu- 'scum (of fat)'; Laz [cimu-] 'fat'; Svan cemil. The continuant is well attested in Old Georgian (da moiyo cmeli... 'and (he)took the fat...' Lev. 8.25). It is a derivative from the verb stem *cwem- : cwm- 'to smear'.

The word occurs in Old Georgian, along with a variant cid- (cf. AbuIa3e 1973: 516). In the Zan forms a trend toward inserting the nasals is noticeable. If final of the Georgian stem is an affix, the Zan forms must be considered loanwords from Georgian. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 75).
CK(?) *cik- 'to stick into': Megr. cik- 'to stick into, stick out'; Laz cig'to stick into, to string'; Svan ciq-, cq-(?). Possibly a Common Kartvelian verb stem. It seems to be of soundsymbolic origin, thus accounting for an obscure correlation of the final consonant (action noun Megr. cikua-, Laz o-cig-u, Svan li-cq-e). In Svan two vocalic shapes of the stem are attested (cf. also cäg 'pin, thorn'). For the interrelations of the Zan forms see Cikobava (1938: 383). | | iSKJa: 224.
GZ *cila- 'white (of egg)': Georg, cila- 'white (of egg)'; Megr. cila-, Laz cil(a)-, cela-.
The word is virtually identical in the languages. The Laz variant with e is likely to be secondary. The similar Svan form oil must have been borrowed from other Kartvelian languages since ancient / in word-final position would not be preserved here. | | Cikobava (1938: 111).
CK *cic(o)- 'wild cat': Georg, cica- 'wild cat'; Svan cicw 'cat'. Evidently of an interjectional origin associated with addressing a wild cat. For Georgian cf. Per., Psav., Xevs. cica- and Ing., Tus. cico- (yionti 1984: 676). A diminutive suffix is attested in the Georgian (Raca) dialectism cicuna-. The analogues of the word in some other languages support its interjectional nature (cf. Hung, cica, Chechen cicig, Ingus cisk < tick). The designations of the domestic cat represented by Georg, kata(diminutive katuna-) and Zan katu- are later cultural loanwords close to Arm. katu 'cat' (cf. Acaryan 1973: 540). | | Klimov (1967: 379).
266



*cick-wn
GZ *cick—wn— 'to nibble': Georg, cickn— 'to nibble'; Megr. ckickon—, ckdckon—.
A verb stem obviously related with *cick—wn—, *cick—wn-, *$i3g—wnand *$i$g-wn- by Kartvelian sound-symbolic rules (unvoiced consonantism indicates a weak mode of action, while the voiced one refers to full strength of it). The development of secondary k in this case is a regular feature of Megrelian phonemic syntagmatics: cf. action noun ckickonua-. The stem contains the extension *-wn. In view of the substantial semantic difference it is difficult to assert a connection with *ceck- 'to pull down; to break'. | | ESKJa: 225.
CK *cmqwa- 'cowberry': Georg, cmqva- 'strawberry'(?); Megr. cim'va-, cam'va-; Svan cinqa, cinaqa 'cowberry'.
The Georgian and Megrelian forms are very similar; the former needs confirmation. The Svan lexeme stands phonetically and semantically apart. The meaning of the Georgian and Megrelian words can hardly be primary in view of the Common Kartvelian *marcqw- 'strawberry'. | | ESKJa: 224.
GZ *cr-il- 'sifted': Georg, [crif]- 'sifted'; Megr. cirilUnattested in Old Georgian. It is a past participle in -// based on the verb stem *cer- : cr—.In modern Georgian the word is reflected in ga—cril— 'sifted'.
1 1 Nadareisvili (IKE XIII: 189).
GZ *crec— : eric— 'to rub away; to fade': Georg, crec— : eric- 'to rub away; to fade'; Megr. time— : ciric— : circ—. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. The regular phonetic correspondences are maintained. Megr. cirac- (action noun ciracua-) has a parallel form ciroc- which points to an earlier non-functional variation e // a in the stem as in a number of other cases. | | Gudava (1974: 133-134).
GZ(?) *ckwr-en- : ckwr-in- 'to draw out': Georg, ckvren- : ckvrin- 'to draw out'; Megr. ckvir-in- 'to prick up one's ears'. A verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. The action nouns are Georg. ckvrena— and Megr. ckvirin—. The meaning of the forms causes some difficulties. For another comparison of the Megrelian stem see Sar^vela3e (1987: 22).
267



*cc
GZ *cc- 'to laugh': Georg. c-~ 'to laugh'; Megr. $ic-, $dc-; Laz $ic-, die-.
Verb stem known in Old Georgian in the form of the action noun si-c-il- 'laughter' (Abula3e 1973: 357).Cf. modern Georg, i-c-in-i-s 'he laughs' with an extension -in (see *cc-in-). In the Zan correspondences double cc is broken up by a narrow vowel (action noun Megr. $ica-). A dissimilation is also attested here: cic- > $ic- > die-. Slightly similar Svan forms with long vowels (cf. the action nouns Ιϊ-cw 'to mock at' and l -cw 'laughter') in view of their w perhaps do not belong here. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Janashvili (see Erckert (1895: 295).Cf. also Marr(1914:64).
GZ *cc-in- 'to laugh': Georg, ein- 'to laugh'; Megr. $icin-\ Laz $icin-, dicin-.
The stem is attested in Old Georgian: da ganicina... 'and (he) laughed...' Gen. 17.17; action noun gancineba- (Sar^velase 1995: 44). The Zan action nouns are Megr. go-^icin- and Laz o-^icin-u. It is derived from the simple stem *cc- by the addition of the affix -in, which in the view of some scholars is identical with the causative affix. Cf. Cikobava (1938: 382). | | SKJa: 226.
CK *cxek- 'brushwood': Megr. cxve(r)k- 'brushwood, dry boughs'; Laz cxik—; Svan cxek 'wood, forest'. One of the isoglosses not including Georgian. In the Megrelian word the position of r is not stable. Cf. semantically similar Georg.-Zan *pictx-. For a Common Kartvelian designation of wood see *tqe-, | | Megrelian, Svan: Marr (1911-1914: 372). Laz: USKJa: 226.
CK (?) *cxwi- 'arrow, thorn': Megr. [cxvi-] 'thorn'; Svan cxwi, cxu 'arrow'. In Megrelian the stem is found in o-cxva-cxvi-n-aia- 'thorny, burning', derived by circumfix ο n-aia from the reduplicated stem with vowel alternation. The similarity to PIE *sk(h)ui(i)- 'needle or thorn' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 958) deserves mention. 1 1 Illic-Svityc (1971:197).
268



c,
CK *c,- 'to be older': Georg, [c-] 'to be older'; Megr. [(n)c-]\ Laz
[(«;<H; Svan [#-].
Unattested in an unbound state, but found in the Common Kartvelian derivative *x-u-c^-e- 'elder, older'. In the Zan correspondence a secondary n occurs. The original meaning of the stem requires possibly a more accurate definition. | | Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Marr (1911-1914 VII: 360-361). Laz: USKJa: 262.
GZ *c,- 'to give; to beat': Georg, c- 'to give; to beat'; Megr. c-, Laz c-. A verb stem with a wide range of meanings (cf. Megrelian 'to feed'). It is well represented in Old Georgian (.. .mces mepuri'.. .(he) shall give me bread' Gen. 28.20; action noun micema- 'to give', cema 'to beat'). The stem is found in the word forms of aoristic tenses. Cf. its derivative *cl-em-.
\ | Cikobava (1938: 369-370).
GZ *C!ad- : Cjd- 'to have time; to wait': Georg, cad- : cd- 'to wait; to delay'; Megr. cod- 'to wait; to have spare time'; Laz cod- 'to have spare time; to empty, finish, end'. A verb stem attested in Old Georgian texts (macade... aymogiyo... 'let me pull out...' Mt. 7.4; acadet mat carslvad 'let these go' Jn. 18.8; action noun cadeba-). The Georgian material shows both ablaut grades. The stem interacts in a complicated manner with *c\al-: c,/-. For the Zan continuants cf. Megr. r-cod-9 'you have time', Laz ma-cod-en-an 'we have time'. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 377-378). Georgian: &SKJa: 227.
GZ *C!al— : cj— 'to empty': Georg, col— : cl— 'to empty; to have spare time'; Megr. col—; Laz [col—].
A verb stem well attested in Old Georgian texts (da mocale xart 'and you are lazy' Ex. 5.17; action noun mocla—). The Laz correspondence has been affected by the continuants of *clad- : c\d~. In Georgian and Megrelian the stems also interact with the latter (cf. the shared action noun colama- in Megrelian). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 366).

269



GZ *c,an-: c,n- 'to learn, know': Georg, can- : en- 'to learn, know'; Megr. ein—; Laz ein-.
A verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian texts: ese aravin cna 'no man ... knew (it)' Jn. 13.28; cf. also the action noun cnoba- and a number of derivatives. Different from Georgian, where both ablaut grades are preserved, Zan languages retain only the zero grade: action nouns Megr. cineba-, Laz o—cin—u. In Laz the derivative o—ein—ad—u 'to charge; to bequeath' is found. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 63). Laz:Cikobava (1938: 376-377).
CK *C!ew-: CiW- 'to take care; to watch': Georg, cav-: cv- 'to take care, keep safe, preserve'; Megr. c(y\- 'to preserve, keep safe; to take care; to hide'; Laz c(v)- 'to watch, wait'; Svan c— 'to preserve'. Verb stem documented in Old Georgian, where it retained the ablaut alternation e ~ 0 (me vhcevd mat Ί kept them safe' Jn. 17.12; action noun cva-; saco- 'congregation'). In Zan languages (action noun Megr. cuala—, Laz o—cval—u and o-c-u), the final v is absent in position before u (cf. Megr. do-v—cv—i Ί have preserved'). In Svan the stem is also reduced (action noun li-l-c-e). \ | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 372-373). Svan: USKJa: 229.
GZ *Cieka- 'basket; body (with a sharp bottom)': Georg, ceka- 'basket; body with a sharp bottom'; Megr. caka-. The Georgian and Megrelian forms agree regularly. Since the word is isolated in the Kartvelian lexicon, it may go back to a cross-cultural borrowing from an ancient language of the Near East. ||Klimov(1973:365).
GZ *c,-em- 'to give; to beat, smite': Georg, cem- 'to give; to beat, smite; to fall'; Megr. cam-'to give; to beat, smite; to feed'; Laz cam- 'to beat, smite; to feed'. Verb stem derived from the simple *c,- by addition of thematic *-em. The stem is well represented in Old Georgian: mcem me 'smitest thou me' Jn. 18.23. Cf. the action nouns Georg, cema-, Megr. cama-, Laz o-cam-u. The stems are used in the presentic-tense word forms. Deeters connected them with Svan li-kem 'to add' (cf.Schmidt 1962: 149). | | Schmidt (ibidem). Cf.SSKJa: 227.
270



*Ciem-in
GZ *Ciem-in- 'to scratch': Georg, cemin- 'to scratch; to tickle'; Megr. camin- 'to bite, sting'; Laz camin- 'to scratch'. The verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. Its connection with the stem in the preceding entry remains unclear (causative marker -/'«?). The meaning of the cognates (action noun Megr. caminua-, Laz o-camin-u) does not support such a comparison. 1 1 USKJa: 228.
CK *Cien- : c,n- 'to grow, flourish (about plants)': Georg, cen- 'to grow, flourish (about plants)'; Megr. can—; Laz can—; Svan sen— : sn—, san—. Common Kartvelian verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian texts, where the variant cejn- and a number of its derivatives are found (igi aymoscenda 'it flourished' Gen. 40.10; action noun ceneba-, mcenare'plant'). The Zan and Svan cognates regularly correspond to the Georgian stem (cf. the action nouns Megr. canapa-, Laz o-can-u, Svan li-sn-e). In Svan the ablaut alternation is preserved. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 371). Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 89).
CK(?) *Cier- 'thumb, big toe': Georg, cer- 'thumb, big toe'; Megr. can($y-; Svan [cer-].
Documented in Old Georgian (cersa zeda dganan '(they) are standing on big toes' Bal. 164.28). The Megrelian form regularly corresponds to the Georgian one. The Svan compound cer—sda 'part of spinning-wheel' is sometimes considered to contain their Svan equivalent. Alongside this lexeme Georgian and the Zan languages have a special term for 'little finger' or 'toe'. Cf. *nek(u)—. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Topuria (1937: 143). Svan: Sardschweladse (1985: 25).
GZ *C!ec!- 'to crumble': Georg, [cec-] 'to crumble'; Megr. cac- 'to thresh, crumble'. In Georgian the verb stem may be seen in the derivative na-m-cec'bread crumbs' (cf. Old Georgian namcuec- with an unclear u). The Megrelian form corresponds phonetically to the Georgian one: cf. kimiocacu 'he crumbled that'. In view of the Old Georgian derivative a protoform *c\uec\- seems also possible. Cf. Penrixi-Sar|vela;$e (1990: 410). | | ESKJa: 228.
GZ *dwet- : Ci\vt- 'to wear out': Georg, cvet- : cvt- : cvit- 'to wear out; to circumcise': Megr. [cut—].
271



*C:Wil
Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (cina-daicvita Abraham... 'Abraham was circumcised...' Gen. 17.24; action noun cueta-). Georg. cud- 'bad' (in Old Georgian it meant 'empty, vain') and cvedan- 'impotent' also belong here. In the Zan languages the stem is represented by the Megrelian derivative cutu— 'impotent'. Svan cut and cuturaj with the same meaning apparently go back to a Zan source. 1 1 USKJa: 229.
CK(?) *C!wil- 'wax': Georg, evil- 'wax'; Megr. cir-\ Laz (ni)cir-; Svan
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian texts, where it meant also 'candle' (yitarca cwilni 'as wax (candles)' Sin. mr. 219.36). Cf. dial. (Ing.) cvin- (yionti 1984: 673). The Megrelian stem was recorded in Brosset (1849: 75). In Laz it is in current use. The connection with the Svan word remains doubtful. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 75). Laz: Marr (1910: 211). Svan: Janashvili (cf. Eckert 1895: 297).
GZ *C!ic,- 'small insect, moth': Georg, [cic-] 'small insect'; Megr. cine-, cic- 'moth'; Laz cic-. In Georgian the stem seems to be part of the compound cici-natela'firefly', the second component of which means 'light' (cf. *nat-e-). If our analysis of the Georgian word holds the latter cannot derive from Lat. cicindela 'firefly'. Armenian c'ec' and Udi cec 'moth', not considered native (cf. Acaryan 1979: 454), possibly support the existence of a genuinely Kartvelian lexeme. Svan cine, cimc 'moth' probably are loanwords. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Fähnrich (1975: 341).
CK *ctol- 'wife': Georg, col- 'wife'; Megr. cil-, Laz cil-; Svan [cos]. Widely represented in Old Georgian texts (ganiqvane coli.. . 'take (thy) wife...' Gen. 19.15). The Zan forms underwent a change o > u > i. The Svan cognate is found in the denominative derivative li-scw-iel 'coire' (cf. its root cos-, past participle of the passive voice na-cos). The word belongs to the substantives showing the correspondence Georg.-Zan / ~
V
Svan s. Sani3e (1958: 253-258) recognized the Svan equivalent in dialectal (Raca, Lecx.) Georg, sil- 'wife of brother-in-law'. | | Megrelian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 31). Georgian: Brosset (1849:75). Svan: Klimov (1960: 27), USKJa: 230.
272



*c,ota
GZ *c,ota- 'few, little' (adv.): Georg, cota 'few, little (adv.)'; Megr. cica, cice; Laz (m)cuta, cita.
The adverb occurs in medieval Georgian literature. Cf. also especially close to its Laz cognates Georgian dialectal (Jav.) cuta. For the Zan forms expressive glottalization of the initial consonant must be assumed. In Megrelian the second c may have resulted from distant assimilation. The correlation i —u is standard for Zan. The word-final vocalism is regular for adverbs. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Dzanasvili (1902: 19).
GZ *CiOCj- 'to climb': Georg, coc- 'to climb'; Megr. coc-. A verb stem whose form indicates a descriptive nature. Nevertheless the phonetic correspondences between Georgian (action noun cocva-) and Zan (Megrelian action noun cocua-) are maintained consistently. Dialectal Arm. c'oc'el 'to crawl, creep' may be an old borrowing from Zan languages (cf. Kapancyan 1975: 371). 1 1 USKJa: 230.
CK *C!OC,x- 'besom': Georg, cocx-'besom'; Megr. [corcx-]; Svan cecx, cäcx.
Unattested in Old Georgian. Although in the Zan languages no continuant seems to be present, vestigially it may be found in the dialectal (Ajar.) Georgian Zanism corcx- with the same meaning. The vocalic shape of the Svan correspondence goes back to through the intermediate steps ö > we. | | Georgian, Svan: Zyenti (1949: 130).
CK ^ox— 'to ruminate': Georg, cox- 'to ruminate'; Megr. cix- 'to eat with appetite'; Svan cexw-, cxw- 'to graze.' A verb stem well attested in Old Georgian, where a number of derivatives are also found: cf. the action noun coxna— (with an extension -«), nacoxal- 'cud', sacoxnel- 'jaws' (Abuk^e 1973: 324, 379, 519). The Megrelian form (action noun cixua-) is sometimes translated as 'to stuff, to feed with force'. The Svan stem (action noun li-cexw, li-cx(\v)-i, cf. la-caxw 'pasture') regularly corresponds to the Georgian. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Kaldani (1969: 78). Megrelian: Kakitase (1968: 141).
GZ *CjUr- 'to swim': Georg, cur- 'to swim; to slide'; Megr. (n)cur- 'to swim'; Laz ncu(r)—, (n)cvir-, ncir—, mcvi(r)—.
273



*c,kip
Verb stem represented in Old Georgian (action noun curva-; mcurval'swimming'). The Zan forms often contain an inorganic word-initial augmentation n. In Laz final r may be absent. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 63). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 373-374.
GZ *c,kip- 'broken branch': Georg, chip- 'broken branch'; Megr. ckip'fork'. The Georgian continuant is recorded in the Imerian dialect (yionti 1984: 679). The phonetic form of the Megrelian cognate is regular. Analogous Svan and West-Georg, clap- 'fork, broken branch with furcation' (cf. yionti 1984: 666) must be considered a Megrelian borrowing. The semantic discrepancy between words does not exceed allowable limits (cf. Lit. sakute 'fork' alongside saka 'branch'). Another juxtaposition of the Georgian word in Penrixi-Sar|vela3e (1990: 415). | | Klimov (1993: 136).
GZ *ctkw- 'to send': Georg, [cikv-] 'to send'; Megr. ck(v)-\ Laz ck(v)-, sk(v)-.
A verb stem whose use was very restricted already in Old Georgian (Kristestwis ukue vhcikut 'we are sent on behalf of Christ'; one of its derivatives is mocikul- 'apostle'). In the Zan languages the stem remains in active use (action noun Megr. ckwnala-, Laz o-ckvin-u, o-skvin-u). The Zan cognates reflect zero grade. The vocalism of the Georgian form is unclear. | | Cikobava (1938: 379).
GZ *dx- 'to oil': Georg, ex- 'to oil'; Laz ex-. Verb stem well known from Old Georgian sources: action noun cxeba-, cxebul- 'anointed at coronation' (Abulaje 1973: 521). In Laz the stem has a limited use. No Megrelian cognate is found.
CK *C!\- 'to burn; to scorch (of the sun)': Georg, ex- 'to burn; to scorch (of the sun)'; Megr. [ex-]; Laz ex-; Svan sx-, six- 'to burn'. Verb stem widely represented in Old Georgian (dascxa mas... 'it was scorched...' Mk. 4.6; action noun dacxoma-). For the Georgian stem an old w can be posited: alongside da-ex—a 'it became hot' we have an action noun cxoba- < * cxveba-. In Laz the same picture may be observed: beside do—ex—u 'it became hot' (cf. ngresta docxu-dortun 'the
274



frying-pan was heated' (Contes 35.12) there is also (m)cxopa- // (m)cxvapa- 'heat, hot weather' presenting an analogy to the Georgian action noun. The Megrelian cognate may be extracted from its derivatives (cf. cxana- 'heat, hot weather'). In Svan the expected c results in a spirant (action noun li-sx-i; cf. ad-six 'he burned it down', me-sx-e 'black' < 'burnt'). From the stem the noun *c\x-e- 'heat' is derived. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 55). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 236 and 381). Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 89).
GZ *CiX-e- 'heat': Georg, cxel- 'hot, heated'; Megr. cxe-; Laz cxe'heat, fever'. Deverbative formation well known from Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 521). The identity of the vocalism of Georgian and Zan forms may be explained by their being original substantives, a use preserved in Laz (Georg. / in word-final position is evidently secondary). Cf. also Megr. sincxe- 'heat'.
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 55). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 236).
GZ(?) *CiXwar- 'sheep': Georg, cxvar- 'sheep'; Megr. sxur-; Laz (m)cxu(r)—, mskur—, mcxur—.
The word is well attested in Old Georgian in the form of cxovar(dautevnis cxovarni 'leaveth the sheep' Jn. 10.12). Old Georgian cxoreba'life' seems to be its derivative. Cf. the dialectal (Moxev., Mtiul.) variant of the lexeme cxor- (yionti 1984: 681). The word is interesting from the point of view of economic characteristics of ancient Kartvelian society. However, some phonetic irregularities suggest doubts in the adequacy of this equation (cf. the unexpected spirantization of c in Megrelian). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Marr (1911-1914 VI: 420).
GZ *C!Xwir- 'nose': Georg, cxvir- 'nose'; Megr. cxvind-; Laz cx(v)ind-, cxund-.
The lexeme is attested in Old Georgian texts, where it meant 'nose, nostrils, snout' (cf. cxwirta sina cemta... 'in my nostrils...' Job 27.3) and had several derivatives. The Zan forms accurately correspond to the Georgian one (the word-final d as in other cases goes back to 3). Topuria thought that the word is somehow related to the Georgian verb rcxven— : rcxvin- 'to be ashamed' (cf. Topuria 1979: 79). M Rosen (1845: 30).
275



CK *C!xim- 'fat, grease': Georg, cxim- 'fat, grease'; Svan \cxim-]. Unattested in Old Georgian. The modern Georgian word is in full agreement with the form, found in Svan ma-cxim with the same meaning. For the derivatory element m&- cf. *«>- and *slwan-. For Georg, cximCikobava (1938: 118) proposes another comparison. 1 1 Klimov (1960: 27).
GZ *C!xi(n)k- 'to sneeze': Georg, cxikv- 'to sneeze'; Megr. cxvink-; Laz cxink—ol—.
Verb stem is likely to have an onomatopoeic character. Cf. the Georgian action noun dacxikveba— and dialectal (Raca) dacxvinkeba— (yionti 1984: 196). The Megrelian action noun is cxvinkap- (here the additional meaning 'to get broken' is found). In Laz the stem contains an affix -ol: action noun o—cxinkol—u (xcinik cxinkolu 'the old woman sneezed' LT 13.1).
GZ *CiXOW-eI- 'animal, animated': Georg, cxovel- 'animal'; Megr. cx(o)u- 'cow'.
Well known in Old Georgian, where it meant 'alive, animated, animal, beast': cf. me cxovel var... Ί live...' Jn. 6.57 (cf. Abulase 1973: 522). The stem of the Megrelian plural form cxou-l-ep- is characterized by a secondary insertion. | | Kipsidze (1914: 368).
GZ *CjXo(w)n- 'to save (soul)': Georg, cxon- 'to save (soul), be saved; to live, be alive (about soul)'; Megr. cxon-. Verb stem well represented in Old Georgian sources (...gacxovna sen '...hath made thee whole' Mt. 9.22; action noun cxoneba-). The Megrelian form regularly corresponds to the Georgian one: cf. sursi mu gicxonuans? 'what can save your soul?' (action noun cxonapa-). \ | Cagareli (1880: 63).
CK *ctxra- 'nine': Georgian cxra- 'nine'; Megr. cxoro-; Laz cxo(v)ro-, ncxoro-; Svan exam.
Numeral widely attested in Old Georgian (yidre cxra zamamde... 'until the ninth hour...' Lk. 23.44), where it had a number of derivatives. The word-final *a, which according to Penrixi-Sar^ve^e (1990: 416) is a suffix, results in Zan forms in ο because of the attributive use of the numeral. The Laz correspondence may contain inserted ν (by the analogy with ovro- 'eight') and an augmentation of the initial n. Megr. cxoria
276



*dxro
'ray' seems to be its historical diminutive formation. In view of the history of the preceding numerals 'seven' and 'eight' a borrowing cannot be ruled out. 1 1 Rosen (1845: 11).
GZ *Cixro- 'cold, chill; shivering': Georg, cxro- 'chill; shivering'; Megr. cxuru- 'severe cold'; Laz [cxur-}. The continuant is attested in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 522). The Zan form agrees with the Georgian one. Their Laz correspondence may be extracted from the derivative ce-cxur- (<cxe-cxur~) 'fever', literally 'fever-shivering'. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 236-237). Georgian: &SKJa: 232.
GZ *C!X-UD- 'to warm; to bake': Georg, cxun- 'to burn (of sun); bake well'; Megr. cun- 'to bake well; to dry'(?); Laz cxun-, cxvin- 'to warm'. Verb derived from the simple base *c\x- by adding the causative suffix *-un. The Georgian action noun is cxuneba-. For the Laz form one assumes a change vi > u (cf. Cikobava (1938: 381), although the inverse process seems no less likely. If the comparison with the Megrelian stem (action noun cunapa-) holds, the loss of χ needs an explanation. 1 1 USKJa: 233.
GZ *3aml- 'kind of rat': Georg. $aml- 'rat'; Laz ^emur- 'big mountain mouse'. In Georgian the word is known only from ancient texts: mcav(i) ^amli mdinarisa ars 'musquash is a rat of the river' Physiologus 188.27. The unusual phonetic correlation Georg, a ~ Laz e needs explication. | | Gigineisvili (1980: 123-126).
GZ *3an3~ 'to be hung (with fruits)': Georg, ^αη^- 'to be hung (with fruits)'; Megr. 30«j-. Verb stem represented in the Gurian dialect of Georgian (action noun da$an$va—). The Megrelian action noun is do$on§ua—. Cf. the derived past participle do^on^il- 'hung with fruits'. | | Zyenti (1940: 225).

*3arc,w-:
GZ *3arc,w-: 3rc(w- 'to take off (clothes)': Georg, yircv-: $rcv- 'to rob'; Megr. rc(v)-; Laz c(v)-. In Old Georgian the continuant has the meaning 'to take off (clothes and the like)': gani$arcua man samoseli 'he took off his clothes' Krest 192: 26-27; action noun $arcuva-, mogrcva- (Sar|vela3e 1995: 146). While Old Georgian forms still distinguish two grades of the ablaut alternation, the modern language possesses only the full grade. The simplification of the Zan correspondences (cf. action noun Megr. rcuala-, Laz go-c-u) results in the loss of v in position before u and in weakening of r in Laz. According to Dzaukjan (1988: 78), Arm. creel, 3r$el 'to extort, take // tear away' is connected with Kartvelian forms. | | Cikobava (1938: 372).
CK *3acxw— 'lime (tree)': Georg, cacxv— 'lime (tree)'; Megr. cxacxu—, cacxu—; Laz ducxu-; Svan zesx—m.
In Old Georgian the lexeme was represented as cacxu- (Abula3e 1973: 514). While the initial consonant of the Georgian word was assimilated to c, in Laz it became desaffricated (cf. *$esa-, *$ecixl-, *$e$w-). The Zan vocalism u is regular (cf. Gudava 1960: 120). The Megrelian form seems to be a blend of the original word with Georgian: hence follows the Georgian shape of the first syllable and the Zan one of the second (cf. Megrelian toponym Cucxv-at- showing the expected Zan reflex of the reconstructed vocalism). In the Svan form both affricates have become spirants and e goes back to a. The old final w is preserved in the toponym Zesxw-is- (in Lecxumi region). Cf. also a suffix -ra attested also in other Svan designations of trees. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 129). Svan: Schmidt (1962: 148).
GZ *3ga- 'edge, brim': Georg. g$-il- 'edge, brim': Megr. $ga- 'bank, shore'; Laz $ga—, m$ga— 'bank, shore; edge'. Its continuant is represented in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 104). The comparison with the Zan forms is to some extent problematic although several other examples of the correspondence between Georgian affixed stem and affixless Zan one (cf. *bark—, *maqw-, *prcxa—) are known. The Georgian form probably underwent a metathesis $g >gj. The Laz cognate contains a word-initial augmentation.
CK *3gib- 'to stuff (tight), drive in': Georg. $gib- 'to tense, strain; to knit
278



*jew- :
one's brows'; Megr. ggib- 'to stuff (tight), drive in'; Laz (n)$gip- 'to caulk'; Svan $gub- : $gb- 'to stuff (tight)'. The verb stem does not occur in Old Georgian. The Megrelian action noun is ^gibua-. For the Laz forms the initial inorganic n as well as the devoicing b >p are rather characteristic (action noun o-(ri)3gip-u). They have also the connotation 'to burn, scorch'. Cf. Marr (1910: 216). The deviation in the vocalism of the Svan cognate requires clarification. 1 1 Klimov (1985: 176).
CK *3ew- : 3w- 'to lie (of inanimate)': Georg. $ev- 'to lie (of inanimate)'; Megr. j(v)-; Laz $(v)-, z(v)-; Svan z-. Common Kartvelian verb stem. Its continuant is widely attested in Old Georgian, where it had mainly the shape of §e- alongside devoicing 3 > c in the word-final position (cf. aha culi $irta tana xetasa $es 'now the axe is laid unto the root of the trees' Mt. 3.10 and dire gic tualsa sensa 'a beam is in thine eye' Mt. 7.3., where gic goes back to gi-$-s). The Megrelian action noun is $vena- // ^sna-. For Svan cf. the word form x-o-z 'it lies (at him'). Sometimes the stem is believed to be a phonetic derivative of *dew- : dw-. 1 1 Georgian, Zan:Cikobava (1938: 387-388). Svan: Schmidt (1961: 152).
GZ *3ek 'simple, simpleton; silly': Georg. $ek- 'simple, simpleton; silly'; Megr. $ak- 'simple, ordinary'. Adjective unattested in Old Georgian. In modern Georgian it occurs in dialects. Cf. also the derived Kartl. and Kiz. verb $ekva-, ga$ekva- 'to fill; to stuff' (ylonti 1984: 144). For Megrelian cf. $aki koci Ordinary man'. 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 36).
GZ *3en-: jin- 'to add, increase': Georg. $en- : jm- 'to add, increase'; Megr. jm-; Laz (/j)jin-. Verb stem well known in Old Georgian: sei$ine $maj igi seni 'thou hast gained thy brother' Mt. 18.15; action noun gineba-, Megrelian action noun $ina-, $inua-. In the Laz a variant with inorganic n occurs (cf. action noun mo-(n)$in-ii).

279



: 3Y
Verb stem represented in Old Georgian sources without stem-middle n\ cf. the past participle na-^e^- 'scutched' (Abulase 1973: 324). By Kartvelian sound-symbolic rules it seems related to GZ *c\ecl-. Action nouns are Georgian jewjva-, Megr. ako^an^ua-. The correspondence in vocalism is regular. In Laz the stem can be tentatively seen in the form o-^an^-u 'to pierce with spike, awl', which allegedly corresponds to its noun correlative dang- 'thorn' (see *$e$w-). The word for flax see under *sel-.
| | Georgian, Megrelian: Sardschweladse (1987: 23).
GZ *3ey- : jy- 'to be sated; be filled': Georg. $ey- : $y- 'to be sated; be filled'; Megr. r$y-; Laz ^y-. Verb stem also well known from Old Georgian texts: da gans$eyit '(and) feedeth them' Mt. 6.26 (action noun gan^yoma-; u-$yeb- 'insatiable'). Both ablaut grades are retained only in Georgian. The Megrelian form shows an inorganic r (action noun rgyapa—). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Deeters (1930: 127). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 390).
GZ *3e§a- 'firewood': Georg, sesa- 'firewood'; Megr. diska-; Laz diska-; Svan zek (?).
The word is attested in Old Georgian (daasxian sesaj... 'and lay the wood in order upon the fire...' Lev. 1.7.) It offers one of the examples of the correspondence between Georg, e and Zan /. Cf. also West Georgian dialectal sisa- (ylonti 1984: 634). In Georgian the affricate has become a spirant with its subsequent assimilation to s. The Zan data show a change 3 > d. Their plural form diska-l-ep- contains secondary /. The connection with the Svan lexeme seems very disputable because of irregular k of the latter. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 72). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 157).
GZ *3ec!xl— 'fire': Georg, cecxl— 'fire'; Megr. dacxir—, da(n)cx9r-; Laz dacxir-, dacxur-, dacxer-.
The word is widely attested in Old Georgian (dacua cecxlita... 'burned up (their city)...' Mt. 22.7; sacecxur- 'thurible'). Cf. the dialectal (Gur.) variant cexl- (ylonti 1984: 678). In the Georgian form the initial ^ (jj?) became assimilated to c, while in Zan it underwent dissimilation. The cluster ex II ex is sometimes considered to be connected with the verb stem *CiX—.

GZ *3e3g- 'to crumple, press upon': Georg. 3e$g- 'to crumple, press upon'; Megr. 3ga$g- 'to chew'. A verb stem of sound-symbolic nature which enters a common structural set with the stems *ceck-, *ceck-, *cecq-, *3e$g-. Action nouns Georg. 5e$gva-, Megr. 3ga$gua-. The meaning of the Megr. form underwent change. The stem has a derivative *3i$g-wn. | | F hnrich (1982: 37).
GZ *3e3(w)- 'thistle, thorn (plant)': Georg, ^e^v- 'thorn'; Laz άα(η)$-, ndaz- 'thistle'. The term is well known from Old Georgian texts (Abula3e 1973: 524-525). In Zan word-initial 3 underwent dissimilation (see *$e§a-, *3ecixl-). Compare, however, Laz o-^an^-u 'to pierce with a thorn, edge' which is likely to belong here. In the Zan form, η must be a secondary augmentation. Similar designations of 'thorn' are recorded in other languages of the Caucasus (cf. Lak ccacc, Darg. 3an$i, Tab. 363) and far beyond its boundaries. 1 1 Marr (1915.1. II: 834).
GZ *3i3g-wn- 'to pinch, nip, tweak (large portion)': Georg, j/jgw- 'to pinch, nip, tweak (large portion)'; Megr. 3gi3gon-, 3g3$gon-. Apparently the form can be considered a derivative from the verb stem *3e3S~ formed with the help of the affix *-wn (Georgian action noun 3*3gna-). In Megrelian forms g is appropriately developed by attraction to 3g at the beginning of the word. The rest of the phonetic correspondence is regular.
| | USKJa: 235
GZ *3un3ul— 'to trot, jog (about walk)': Georg, ^un^ul— 'to trot, jog (about walk)'; Megr. jva/jjva/—. Unattested in Old Georgian. The unusual correlation of vocalism between the Georgian and Megrelian forms is conditioned by their soundsymbolic nature. The same fact is indicated by its quasi-reduplicated form. Cf. the similar correlations in
GZ *3U3U- 'breast (female)': Georg. 311311- 'breast (female)'; Megr. 3U3U-; Laz buy- (?).
The word occurs in Old Georgian texts (netar ... 31*31*10, romelta ara acoes 'blessed are ... paps, which never gave suck' Lk. 23.29; there are
281



also a number of derivatives here). The irregular change of the Laz continuant can be explained by the symbolic nature of the stem or by the influence of Greek βυζί or Adyg. bags II Kab. bs^ of the same meaning. Contrary to Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 297) Svan dud l 'nipple' most probably is an affixal derivative from *dud-. Similar symbolic formations are known in many languages of the area (cf. Agul I I ESKJa: 235.
CK *3iag-: 3!g- 'to poison": Georg. $ag- 'to despise, be ugly'; Megr. gog—; Laz $og-, (n)$ug- 'to be ugly; get on the nerves'; Svan zag—: zg'to poison'. Common Kartvelian verb stem represented in Old Georgian (m^ori mati g^agdin... 'ye shall have their carcasses in abomination...' Lev. 11.11; action noun $ageba-}, where its derivatives are also known. Contrary to the Megrelian form (cf. action noun go-gog-apa) the Laz cognate (cf. action noun go-ngug-u) points to a change o > u and an inorganic n in the steminitial position. For the Svan cognate a regular spirantization 3 > z is characteristic. Cf. the action noun li-zg-en-i (ot-zag-a 'he has poisoned him') and zag 'gun-powder'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Rogava. Laz, Svan: Klimov (1960: 25).
CK(?) *3,al- 'sinew, string': Georg. yd- 'string'; Svan $A(a) (?).
The term is attested in Old Georgian sources (Abulage 1973: 523). The fact that the word-final / could not be preserved in Svan raises doubts on the adequacy of this comparison. In case the Svan form is a borrowing from Megrelian, which seems to be more probable, the lexeme belongs to the Georgian-Zan stage. If this comparison holds, the word primarily designated sinew, which was used for making strings. | | Abulase (IKE XIII, 1962: 219).
GZ *31aryw- 'vein, sinew': Georg. $aryv- 'vein'; Megr. $eryv-; Svan
The word is well known in Old Georgian texts (^aryuni cemni... 'my sinews...' Job 30.17). Like in some other cases, in the Megrelian word instead of the expected ο we have e (cf. *oc,-, *yor-, etc.). Their Laz

CK *3iayl- 'dog': Georg, gayl- 'dog'; Megr. goyor-; Laz $oyo(r)-; Svan zey, zay.
A word widely represented in Old Georgian (gaylnica movidodes... '(and) the dogs came..' Lk. 16.21). An earlier suffixal nature of/ is probable (Cikobava (1938: 83). Cf. the Old Georgian pejorative lexeme gayuer- 'stupid, canine'. In Svan the word-initial affricate has regularly become a spirant, and final / has been lost. The vocalism a of the oblique cases stem (cf. dative zayw) is here primary. | | Georgian, Megrelian, Svan: Rosen (1845: 408-409). Laz: Marr (1914: 33).
CK *3,ax-: 3,x- 'to call, be called': Georg. $ax- 'to call; to cry, shout'; Megr. $ox- 'to be called'; Laz $ox-,jox- 'to call'; Svan zäx-: zx- (sx-) 'to be named, be called'. The verb continuant is well attested in Old Georgian, where it shows mainly a spirantized word-initial consonant (izaxis lomman... 'the lion is roaring on...' Isaiah 31.4; action noun zaxeba-). For the transitive verb 'to call' Megrelian uses the Georgian borrowing $ax- (cf. however, mgaxo ...'my name is'...'). The Laz correspondence is apparently based on the derivative noun 30x0- 'name' (Cikobava (1938: 437-438; cf. Marr 1936: 92-93). In Svan (action noun li-zax) the affricate is regularly reflected as a spirant. The phonetic shape and meaning of the stem does not encourage a search for its source beyond Kartvelian languages.

All the Svan variants of its match (Lent, zaqwar, Upper Bai zaqwär, Lasx. zaqwer, Lower Bai zäqw-ra) are thought to stem from *$aq\ve—ra—. In the Zan languages the lexeme seems to be absent. The semantic reconstruction of the archetype is somewhat conventional. | | Gigineisvili (1972: 151-152).
*3iger- 'to bang; to beat (against)': Georg. $ger- 'to bang; to beat (against)'; Megr. [|gar-] The verb stem is reflected in Old Georgian: action noun se^gereba(Abulaje 1973: 496). Its Megrelian correspondence may be seen in the reduplicative formation 3gar—$gal- 'to tremble, shake' marked by a dissimilation r > 1. The stem is apparently related to Georg. 3ig$ig- (see *3iig~3\ig-) and zaggag- 'tremble, shiver'. Cf. Vogt (1947: 49). 1 1 £SKJa: 237.
CK(?) *3!gwamb- 'to strike': Georg, ^gvamb- 'to drain at one draught, swallow'; Svan ^gwemb- 'to bang (with fist)'. The Georgian continuant is represented in the Imer. dialect (yionti 1984: 685). In spite of the regular phonetic correspondence between the Georgian and Svan stems they may be considered to have an onomatopoeic nature, which is corroborated by the evident difference in their semantics. The Svan action noun is li-^gwemb-e. | | Klimov (1988: 21).
GZ *3iegw- 'blackthorn, sloe': Georg. $egv— 'blackthorn, sloe'; Megr.
The Georgian word occurs at present in the Lecx. dialect (yionti 1984: 685). A regular Megrelian correspondence can be seen in the form $agvrepresented in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani (interpreted here as 'small shrubbery') and considered to go back to the Megrelian substrate. | | Danelia (1984: 86).
284



GZ *3ιβ1- 'tree, wood': Georg. $el- 'bar'; Megr. 30- (pi. stem ja/-) 'tree, wood'; Laz (n)jo- (pi. stem (n)^al-), m$a-. The word is well documented in Old Georgian, where it denoted 'tree, wood' (damoekida $elsa... 'he hanged him...' Gen.41.13). In the Jav. dialect it denotes 'bearing (bridge) log of house'. In Zan the ancient / is preserved in the plural forms of the word. ||Marr(1912.1: 1096).
GZ *3ier- 'kite': Georg. ^er-a~ 'kite': Megr. [jajH; Laz m^a^-. hi Old Georgian the word is attested in a form without suffix -a (AbuIa3e 1973:524).The former Megrelian match is found in the Georgian Zanism 3030.- with the same meaning, borrowed by the Gur. dialect (cf. yionti 1984: 777). The Laz cognate occurs in Xopa dialect. Georg. ^er^eruka-; Old Georgian ^en^eruka- noted in Sar^ve^e (1995: 255) 'bird similar to hawk' is based on $er- and its derivative ^eruka- 'little kite'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Rogava (1947: 354).

Well-known from Old Georgian where it preserved the ablaut alternation (caru^eyu ersa mas... 'lead the people...' Ex. 32.34). In the Zan languages (the Laz stem may be extracted from derivatives) there is no ν before the affixal u: Megr. b-gyu-k Ί go in front of, but gyver- 'leader'.

1 1 Georgian, Zan: Marr (1914: 60-62). Svan: Sanidze (1941: 183).
GZ *3ieCjW- 'chain': Georg, jec/tv- 'little chain'; Megr. jacv'chain'. A difficult word. Beside $eckv- and its dialectal (Raca) variant 3e$gvthe form $acv- is also known in Georgian. Its Old Georgian shape is $acu(Abula3e 1973: 573). The development of k in the Georgian form is irregular (cf., however, *Ci «-€/-). Other interpretations of the stem proceeding from the reverse assignment of the data (cf. Gigineisvili1965; Penrixi-Sar3vela3e 1990:502-503), are faced with greater difficulties.

*3iec,(w)n
CK(?) *3ieci(w)n- 'willow': Georg. $ecn-a- 'willow'; Megr. zicon-, cicon—; Svan cicand (?).
In Old Georgian the form lacked affixal -a (rtoj ^ecnisaj 'a branch of willow' Keimena I, 115. 20). According to Cikobava (1942: 33) it is a former compound *$\el- 'tree' + *c{n- 'to braid, plait', which repeats the semantic structure of the Indo-European names for willow (cf. Gamkrelidze-Ivanov 1995: 540). The Svan form, which may be viewed as an old Megrelian borrowing, shows word-final nd found also in some other names of trees. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Machavariani. Cf. ASKJa: 237. Also Topuria (1979: 262).
CK *3ieqw- 'pouch of skin': Georg. $exv- 'ham'; Svan zaq(i) 'wineskin, water-skin'. In Old Georgian sources the lexeme seems to be unattested. The phonetic correspondences are basically regular. For the semantics cf. *guda- 'leather bag,wineskin'. The Svan cognate alongside spirantization of an etymological affricate points to age of q.
CK *g,w- 'to be old (of things)': Georg. [$v-] 'to be old (of things)'; Megr. [|v-]; Laz [Jv-]; Svan [$w-\. A stative verb which at present occurs only in bound forms. The stem may be seen in the Georgian-Zan derivatives *$liw—en— : ^w—in- 'to become old' and *$iW-el- Old (of things)'.
GZ *3iW-el- 'decrepit, old' (about things)': Georg. $vel- 'decrepit, old mostly about things)'; Megr. $ves-, Laz ^ve(s}-, ngves, mgve-. The adjective is widely known in Old Georgian (aravin staasxis ywino axali txierta $uelta... 'no man putteth new wine into old bottles...' Mk. 2.22; cf. its derivative si-guel-e- 'decrepitude'). It is derived from the base *j|W- with the help of the word-forming affix -el. In the Zan forms one sees sometimes an ending of the genitive. Despite Cikobava (1938: 238-239) the correlation between Georg. / and Zan s has a phonological character. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 72). Laz: Marr (1912: 39).

For the antiquity of the element *3\ig- cf. *3\ger-. In Svan the stem is extended by the affix -sn : -un (action noun li-^g-sn-e). The comparison presupposes the existence of the simple stem. Cf.

Widely represented in Old Georgian texts (ganiywi^a ... ^ilisagan 'being raised from sleep' Mt. 1.24). In Megrelian the stem is traceable in the denominative derivative j/ra 'to sleep'.

GZ *31in— 'to sleep, fall asleep': Georg, ^in— 'to sleep, fall asleep'; Megr. $ir- 'to lie (down); to lean (on)'; Laz Jz'n-, $ir- 'to go to bed;to sleep'. The verb stem is documented in Old Georgian (kualad davi$ine 'then I fell asleep' Gen.41.21; action noun da^ineba-). In Megrelian (action noun do-(n)$ira-) and partly in Laz (action noun o-^in-u II o-n^ir- ) the stem is contaminated with its nominal correlate having r at the end(see the preceding entry). 1 1 Megrelian, Georgian: Brosset (1844: 16).

Vogt (1939: 128). The Georgian and the Zan forms match each other regularly. The Georgian-Zan derivative *$, ir-k(w)- is derived from this stem.

GZ *3iixe- 'fortified settlement': Georg, cixe— 'fortress, prison', Megr.
The word is well known in Old Georgian, where it had several derivatives (Abula3e 1973: 517). It is represented also in toponymies: cf. Armaz-cixe- (Greek "Άρμακηκοί, Άρμοσίκη), Axal-cixe-, etc. The word-initial consonant in Georgian is assimilated. The discrepancy in the final vowels in Georgian and Zan forms requires explanation. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 34). Laz: USKJa: 239.
CK *3,ma- 'brother': Georg. $ma- 'brother'; Megr. $ima- (pi. Laz $uma- (pi. $umal-); Svan Jam-//, $im-il, $um-il 'brother (in relation to the sister)'.
288



*31ma-did
Kinship term well attested in Old Georgian (hrkua lakob gnata... 'Jacob said to his brothers...' Gen. 31.41). The identity of α in Georgian and Zan words points to its final position in a substantive stem. Therefore / of the plural forms of the Zan cognates must be a secondary development. The Svan lexeme contains the former estimation suffix -al // -il (cf. also the Svan oath formula ^im-daj 'brother-sister'). On the basis of the Georgian dialectal addressing interjection ^amo\ Old chap!' and gnan-eb-i 'brothers' as well as the Zan forms containing / one has reconstructed in the past prototypes *$am-an- for Georgian and *$om-al- for Zan incompatible with each other in their suffixal part (cf. Cikobava 1938: 26-27). | | Georgian, Zan: Rosen (1845: 32). Svan: Marr (1912.3: 428430).
GZ *3, ma-did- 'elder brother': Georg, gnad- 'best man (of fiancee)'; Megr. ymad— 'uncle'; Laz $umad—. Kinship term well known in Old Georgian sources (^madi igi s^alsa etqvis . . . 'best mansays to the bride... ' Sin. mr. 230.15). According to one opinion it is a compound consisting of *^ma- 'brother' and *did- 'big, elder' (cf. Cikobava (1938: 28). Alternatively the lexeme may be the adverbial case form of 'brother' *^ma-d. The parallel *da-did- 'elder sister' must have an analogous structure. 240.
GZ *3,m-ar- 'vinegar': Georg. $mar- 'vinegar'; Megr. [$imol-]; Laz 3umo(r)-, ngumor-, Svan ^imar (?).
Well known in Old Georgian texts (misces mas ynari 'they gave him vinegar' Mt. 27.34). It is a derivative based on *^m(u)- 'salt'. In Megrelian the stem may be seen in the verb ^imolua- 'to salt'. For the other cases of identity of r in the noun stem's end cf. *meser-, *jor-, *cixwar-. The native character of the Svan word causes doubt. Cf. Schmidt (1961: 152). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 75). Laz: Deeters (1926-1927:
51). Svan: USKJa: 240.
CK *3,m(u)- 'salt': Georg. [$m-] 'salt'; Megr. ^imu-; Laz (n) Svan jim, ξθτη. The stem was replaced already in Old Georgian by a Greek loanword. Its stem can be discerned in the derivative $mar- 'vinegar' (cf. the
289



preceding entry). In the Zan languages and Svan the old sonant is reflected as a combination of a vowel with the following m. The end of the archetype needs more clarity. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 32). Svan: Caraja (1912: 23). Georgian: USKJa: 239.
GZ *3,n- 'to load burden': Georg. $n- 'to get heavy, difficult'; Laz $in'to load (burden)'. Attested in Old Georgian sources: ara mi—^n—s ege 'it does not oppress me', $nel- 'heavy, difficult' (Abula3e 1973: 527). For Laz cf. the action noun ge-$in-u 'to load burden' and past participle geginer'burdened.'
GZ *3iOW- 'to graze, pasture': Georg, jov- 'to graze, pasture'; Laz
The verb stem is attested with its derivatives in Old Georgian ($ovdes kidesa zeda 'they fed in a meadow' Gen. 41.18; action noun jovna- 'to graze', da^oveba- 'to pasture'). In Megrelian the stem has been lost. In the Laz forms (action noun 0-3-11 'to graze', o-gvin-u 'to pasture') v disappears before u. In initial position an inorganic norm often develops. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 437).
CK(?) *3iU- 'bitch, female of beasts of prey': Georg. 511- 'bitch, female of beasts of prey'; Megr. $ιια-\ Svan $u(w)a (?). The lexeme occurs often in Old Georgian in the form $uv- (qmaj lomisa guvisa... 'the roaring of the lioness...' Job 4.10). The Megrelian word-final a seems to be a secondary affix. The Svan analogue may be a recent Zan borrowing. The word finds its parallels in some Daghestanian languages. | | Georgian, Zan: cf. Topuria (1979: 68). Svan: £SKJa: 240.
GZ *3iua- 'horse-hair': Georg. $ua- 'horse-hair'; Megr. 3110-; Svan $i, fr (?)·
In Old Georgian sources the word seems to be absent. The Megrelian form regularly corresponds to the Georgian one.Their Svan analogue in all probability is a Zan loanword. There can be little doubt that Kartvelians of the time of the proto-language did not know domestic horses. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 111). Svan: Marr (1915.1: 773).

*3iU(w)an- : *3iu(w)n
CK *3,u(w)an- : *3,u(w)n- 'to be in heat (of animals)': Georg. $uvn-, $un- 'to be in heat (of animals)'; Megr. $un-, $ud-, $vid- 'to kiss'; Laz $und-; Svan $wan-, ^uwn- 'to be in heat (of animals)'. In Old Georgian the verb stem seems to be unattested. It can be viewed as a derivative from *$\u- 'female, bitch'. Cf. the Georgian action nouns m^uvnoba— and mgundoba—. For the Zan forms a change in meaning and the development of d are characteristic (action noun Megr. $uma-, Laz o-^und-u). Cf. also the Svan action nouns li-^νναη-αΐ 'to copulate' and li-$wan-i 'to cover (of cattle)'. 1 1 F hnrich (1982: 37; 1984: 45).
CK *3,yw-an- : 3iyw-n- 'to take; to send': Georg. $γναη- : jyvw- 'to send gift'; Megr. gyon-, ζγιιη-; Laz (n)^yon-, zyun-; Svan ζγνναη-, zoyw n— 'to take with oneself; to deliver judgement'. Derived from the simple verb stem *$\eyw- : $\yw- by means of the affix -an having in this case causative function. The stem is well represented in Old Georgian: miugyuana Herodes... 'he sent him to Herod...' Lk. 23.7; action nouns mo^yuneba- 'to gift, donate' and mo$Yuaneba- 'to send'; cf. also jyuen- 'gift'. The Zan (action noun Megr. jyonopa-, Laz o—ngyon—u) and Svan (action noun li-zoywan-) cognates show regular phonetic development. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Marr (1914: 60-61). Svan: &SKJa: 241.
CK *3i3iW-al- 'bone': Georg, jva/- 'bone'; Megr. [giggv-] 'bony, thickset'; Svan ^φν 'bone'. Represented in Old Georgian ($ual ar asxen '(it) hath not ... bones' Lk. 24.39). Cf. modern Georgian dialectal variant m$val-. In Megrelian the word is seems to be lost, but may be found as a Zanism in the Gur. dialect although its g requires an explanation; cf. Cikobava (1940: 93-94). The initial "geminated" consonant is eliminated in Megrelian and Svan by inserting the narrow vowel. | | Georgian, Svan: $anasvili (1906: 20). Megrelian: Cikobava (ibidem).
GZ *caw- : cw- 'communicate, inform, announce': Georg, seav- 'to mean, to designate; to inform; to teach'; Megr. c(o}- 'to inform, to tell'; Laz c(v)— 'to speak, to tell'.
291



*catx
Verb stem well known in Old Georgian, where it had a wide range of meanings (ascaveda mat... 'he taught them...' Mk. 1.22; action noun scaveba-). In the Georgian word the former prefix of the oblique object 5- is fused with the stem. The Megrelian present tense forms contain /: cf. micou 'he told me' vs. micolens 'he will tell me'. In Laz the position of v is instable: cf. u-cv-es 'they told him', but u-c-u 'he told him'. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 393-394). Georgian: Fähnrich (1987: 36).
GZ *catx- 'salted, pickled': Georg, catx- 'salted, pickled'; Megr. cutx-e; Laz cutx-e, mcutx-e; Svan catx- (?).
Adjective known from Old Georgian with meaning 'pus': $aylnica ... hlosnied cutxsa 'dogs... licked the pus' Mam. scav. 58.29. The irregular correspondence Georg, a ~ u points to age of m in the Zan form. The Svan form is likely to have been borrowed from a Georgian source. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 243). Georgian, Svan: Fähnrich (1985: 28).
CK(?) *cam- 'moment, instant': Georg, cam- 'moment, second'; Megr. cum-., cun- 'minute, second'; Laz cun-; Svan cam (?). Represented in Old Georgian texts where it meant also 'eyelash'. Cf. also camcam- 'eyelashes' and camcameba- 'to blink' (Abulase 1973: 531, 532). Its Zan equivalents are characterized by the change m > n. The adduced Svan form, despite parallel camcam 'fast', may not be native. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 64). Laz: Penrixi-Sar^ve^e (1990: 440). Svan: USKJa: 242.
GZ *cam- 'to bequeath, charge'; Georg, cam- 'to bequeath; to inform'; Laz cum- 'to charge'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian texts (ucame ersa mas... 'bequeath to the people...' Ex. 19.10; cf. a derivative cameba- 'information'). In modern Georgian dialects (Gur., Ajar., Kartl.) the action noun damo-cm-eb-a— 'to charge, bequeath' shows zero vocalism (yionti 1984: 179). In Laz regularly expected in position next to the labial m results in u. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1987: 23).
GZ *car- preverb of direction 'down, away, off': Georg. ca(r)- preverb 'away, off'; Megr. co- preverb 'down, below'; Laz co-. Widely in use in Old Georgian texts as car- (carvida mat tana '(he) went with them' Lk. 7.6), which points to its relation to the adverb
292



*car- : cr
*ca-re- (see below). The Zan form of the preverb regularly corresponds to the Georgian one.
GZ *car- : cr- 'to have time; forestall; to warn': Georg, scar- : scr- 'to have time; forestall; to warn'; Megr. cor-. Verb stem widely in use in Old Georgian (ascro mas lesu 'Jesus prevented him' Mt. 17.25; action noun scrola—). The Georgian form seems to be augmented with the prefix of the third person of the indirect object s. The Megrelian cognate (action noun corapa-) reflects only the full grade. The comparison of the Georgian-Zan material with the Svan verb stem ser-: sr- 'to overcome, surpass' (cf. Topuria IKE XII, 1960: 155) remains tentative. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Rogava.
GZ *ca|>- 'to study, to learn': Georg, cap- 'to teach, to study, to learn'; Laz (n)cop-.
Verb stem known in Old Georgian through its derivatives: cf. mcapel'leading', mocape- 'follower, pupil' (Abulaje 1973: 309). Cf. also the modern Georgian action noun ga-cap-v-a- 'to perfect oneself. In Megrelian the stem seems to be lost. The Laz correspondence (action noun o—ncop—ul-u) shows the augmentation of n. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 402).
GZ *cel- 'year': Georg, eel- 'year'; Megr. [ci-, cs-] 'this year'; Laz [co-].'
The lexeme is attested in Old Georgian (mas celsa... 'in the same year...' Gen. 26.12). In the Zan languages the vocalism ο occurs mainly in the derivatives: cf. Megr. and Laz go-co-s 'last year'. The Georgian variant cen- vs. Megr. cana- 'year' poses an additional problem. The history of the stem needs more clarification. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 205).
GZ *cec- 'to touch': Georg, cec-, cenc- 'to touch'; Megr. cac- 'to dip'. Verb stem apparently unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language (action noun ceceba-) there is a variant with secondary n-. Cf. the Megrelian action noun ge-cac-ap-a-. It is not ruled out that the form in question reflects historically the full grade of the stem, whose zero grade is rendered by the form *c- < *cc- (cf. *c(w)-). | | Sardzveladze (1991: 144).
293



*cec—: cic
GZ *cec-: cic- 'to stretch, draw': Georg, cec-: cic- 'to scutch, pull about'; Megr. cic-, cvicv- 'to pull out; to tear up'; Laz ci(n)c- 'to pull (slowly)'. In Georgian (action noun cicva-) the old vowel alternation is preserved. The Megrelian variant with v seems to be secondary (cf. action noun ciconua—). An inorganic n is possible in the Laz cognate: ci(n)cups '(he) pulls'. The semantic deviation of the material is rather noticeable. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Marr (1910: 219). Megrelian: Cikobava (1938: 396).
GZ *ceck- 'to crack (into small pieces)': Georg, ceck- 'to crack (into small pieces)'; Megr. ckanck— 'to chew'. Unattested in Old Georgian sources. The Megrelian form (action noun ckanckua-} agrees completely with the Georgian one (action noun ceckva-). The inorganic n of the Megrelian cognate shows a minimal deviation. The stem underlies the derivative *cick-wn- 'to nip, pinch (into small pieces)' formed by adding the affix -wn. 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 36).
GZ *c(w)- 'to dip': Georg, c— 'to dip'; Megr. c(v)-; Laz nc-. Verb stem well known from Old Georgian (daaco puri...' dip bread...' Ruth 2.14; action noun dacoba). The Georgian forms in and the Megrelian action noun gecuapa- prove that w belongs to the root. The Laz cognate (action noun o—nc—u) has developed an inorganic n. | | Georgian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 391). Megrelian: Fähnrich (1987: 36).
CK *cw- 'to appear, be seen': Georg. [cv-] 'to seem, appear'; Megr. [cv-]; Laz [cv-]; Svan cv-, In Georgian and Zan languages the verb stem can be extracted only from a bound form con- (see *cw-en-). In Svan it is used independently: cf. xo-cv-a 'it turned out he had seen'. | | Gamqrelije-Macavariani (1965: 251-252).
CK *cwel- 'dry stem, straw': Georg, cvel- 'chaff'; Megr. cu-\ Laz cu'straw, stem'; Svan cwi, ciw 'stalk, stem'. Attested in Old Georgian (pirvelad cueli... 'first the blade...' Mk. 4.28). It illustrates the well-known correlation between Georg, -el and
294



*cw-en
Zan -u in word-final position. The Laz lexeme has a derivative o-cval-e'chaff'. The Svan cognate reflects the umlaut process. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Topuria (IKE I, 1946: 78-79). Laz: ESKJa: 243. Svan: F hnrich (1985: 38).
CK *cw-en- 'to see, show': Georg, con- 'to like, please'; Megr. con-; Laz con- 'to like; to seem'; Svan cwen- 'to show; to appear'. The verb stem is derived from the base *cw- with the help of the affix *-en. In Georgian and the Zan languages it underwent a change we > o. The meaning 'to seem' is represented in the Laz phrases kai aconu 'he liked' (literally 'it seemed to be well to him'), coinciding from the point of view of content with an analogous Abxaz construction (cf. also pati aconu 'he did not like', where pati is 'bad'). For Svan cf. the action noun li—cwen—e.
1 1 Gamqreli3e-Macavariani (1965: 251-252).
GZ *cwl-il- 'little, small': Georg, cvril- 'small'; Laz culu- 'little, small'. In Old Georgian the adjective is represented in the shape of [(m)culil-, curil- (cf. Abulase 1973: 552) and with the meaning 'small, little, narrow': icro ars bcej da culil gzaj 'strait is the gate and narrow is the way' Mt. 7.14. In Laz the meaning of the word appears distinctly in the designation of the little finger culukit- where kit- is 'finger'. For the correspondence between Georg. -// and Zan -u see *tp-il-, *(m)s}xw-il-, *srsw-il-.

CK *ci— 'to squeak, cheep': Georg, ci—v— 'to squeak, cheep': Megr. ci—, nci—\ Laz ci—; Svan cil— (?).
Verb stem of a descriptive nature. Action nouns are Georg, civ-il-, Megr. ci-αρ-, Laz o-ci(j)-u. Georgian v as in other similar formations is a specific trait, whose reconstruction for the protoform remains disputable (cf. *ki-, *qi-, *cxi-, etc.). It is supported, however, by Arm. cval of the same meaning, reflecting the rules of the areal onomatopoeia. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 394). Svan: ESKJa: 243.
CK *cid(a>- 'mud, dirt (on body)': Georg, cida- 'mud, dirt (on body)'; Megr. ci(n)da-, cimda— (?); Svan cid— 'mud, excrement'. The lexeme is well documented in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 544), where it had a derivative cido(v)an- 'dirty; menstruating'. In Megrelian
295



*cikw
the word may have been borrowed. In Svan it has a wider semantic range. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Sardschweladse (1987: 23). Megrelian: Klimov (1988: 163).
GZ *cikw- 'to soil (oneself)': Georg, cikv- 'to soil (oneself)'; Megr. cikv-; Laz cikv-.
Attested in Old Georgian: action noun semcikeba- (cf. Sar|velage 1995: 237). The verb stem is well known in some modern Georgian dialects. The Megrelian action noun is cikua-, docikua-. In Laz the stem has a restricted use: cf. komuicikveen '(it) became dirty' (CTV: 65.14). | | Klimov (1988: 163).
GZ *cil- 'to pick (fruit, flowers)': Georg, eil- 'to gather, pick (fruit, flowers)'; Megr. cil- 'to pick (fruit, flowers)'; Laz eil-. The verb stem, lost in modern Georgian, has been preserved as a gloss in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani (action noun mocilva-). The sound type of the cognates coincides: cf. the Megrelian action noun cilua- (vardisi cilua 'to pick roses') and Laz o-cil-u). The deviations in meaning are almost imperceptible. | | Cikobava (1938: 395).
CK *cip- 'beech nut': Georg, cip- 'beech nut'; Megr. [cip-]: Laz [cip-]; Svan cip. The word underlies the Kartvelian designation of the tree (see thefollowing entry). In Georgian beside dialectal (Kartl.) cip- (yionti 1984: 706) the widely used reduplicated formation cicibo- 'chestnut' may be related. In both of the Zan languages the stem is discerned in the designation of the beech. 1 1 Klimov (1985: 177).
GZ *cip-l- 'beech': Georg, cipela- 'beech'; Megr. cipur-; Laz cipu(r)-. Formation derived from the designation of the beech nut *cip- by adding the suffix -/. The old word-final sonant is regularly reflected. In Laz a derivative ma-(n)cipur-e~ 'squirrel' occurs. The Svan form cip-ra 'beech' belongs to another word-formation type (cf. its suffix -ra characterizing the names of plants and trees). | | Georgian and Megrelian: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895: 292) and Caraia (1895 XII: 109).Laz:Cikobava (1938: 127).
296



*cicil
GZ(?) *cicil— 'young snake': Georg, cicil— 'young snake'; Laz cicila'snake'. A problematic Georgian-Zan juxtaposition since in Georgian the variant with a diminutive suffix -a may also be adduced. In the light of the Laz verbal word-form gama-cil-up-s 'it hatches out eggs' a reduplicative structure of the word seems to be probable. 1 1 Fähnrich (1975: 40).
GZ *cick-wn- 'to pinch, hack to small pieces': Georg, cickvn- 'to pinch, hack to small pieces'; Megr. ckickon-, cksckon- 'to eat with a feeling of disgust'. The verb stem based on *ceck- 'to crack (into small pieces)' and connected through the regular rules of Kartvelian sound-symbolics with *cick-wn-, *cick-wn-, *3i$g-wn-, *$i$g-wn-. In the first syllable of the Megrelian form (action noun ckickonua-) k appears due to the attraction of the structure of the second syllable. 1 1 USKJa: 244.
GZ *ckand-: cknd- 'to get cleared, refined (of sediment)': Georg, cknd'to be cleared, refined (of sediment)'; Megr. ckond— 'to spin thread; to be cleared of sediment'; Laz ckond- 'to spin thread'. Unattested in Old Georgian sources. Whereas in Georgian a zero ablaut grade is reflected, the Zan form retains a full grade (the action nouns are Georg, ckndoma—, Megr. ckondua—). The Zan cognate presupposes an original vocalism a. Cf. also Megr. cqari ckonda 'settled water'. Megr. ckant-il- 'clean' formally resembles the stem *ckend—. The meaning of the Laz stem is narrowed. The material similarity to PIE *skendh- 'to fall out' (cf. Pokorny 1959: 930) is note
worthy. ||Cikobava(1938:399).
CK *ckend- 'to exude, ooze': Georg, ckent- 'to ooze, exude; to press out'; Megr. [ckint-] 'to ooze, exude'; Laz [ckint-]; Svan skind-. For its Old Georgian continuant see *ckintl-. Whereas in Georgian and Svan the verb has an independent use (cf. the action nouns ckenta- and H—skind—e respectively), in the Zan languages it may be traced only in its derivative ckintil— (cf. *ckintl—). The change d > t may be ascribed to the rules of Kartvelian sound symbolics (cf. *cr—ed— : cr—d— : cr—id— and
297



*ckep
GZ *ckep- 'to split, splinter': Georg, ckep- 'to split, splinter'; Megr. ckap-. The verb stem has a nominal derivatives *ckep-l- 'twig, birch' and *ckip- 'flick'. Cf. Georgian chip- 'flick'. The Megrelian form has a number of additional meanings (for instance, 'to draw in line'); its past participle is ckap—il— 'finely cut'. The stem may be included in a group of verbal formations containing expressive stem-final p. Therefore its similarity to PIE *skep- 'to split' (Pokorny 1959: 930, cf. Abaev 1988: 72) must not be overrated. | | Klimov (1985: 177).
GZ *ckep-l- 'twig, birch': Georg, ckepl-a- 'twig, birch'; Megr. [ckapul-].
A transparent noun derivative from the verb stem *ckep-. The word is attested in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 549). While in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani it occurs still without the suffix -a, for modern Georgian the latter is characteristic. The historical Megrelian equivalent may be discerned in the denominative verb stem ckapulua- 'to cut into small pieces'. The alignment of Svan ckäp- 'row' seems doubtful. | | ESKJa: 244.
CK *cker- : ckr- 'to cut into small pieces': Georg, [cker-] 'to cut into small pieces'; Megr. ckir-, Svan ckr- 'to sharpen, point'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 209). In modern Georgian it may be deduced from its noun correlative ckir- 'thin stick, wooden spit, metal rod' represented in particular in the Psav. dialect (cf. yionti 1984: 709). The Megrelian action noun ckirua- reflects the zero grade of the stem. The same grade is found in the Svan parallel (cf. the action noun li-ckr-e). The material similarity to PIE *(s)ker— (cf. Pokorny 1959: 938) may be noted. | | Georgian, Svan: cf.Topuria (1979: 204). Megrelian, Laz: Nadareisvili (1974: 145).
GZ *cker- : ckr- 'to grind, clang': Georg, ckr-ial- 'grind, clang'; Megr. ckir—in—.
A verb stem known from Old Georgian sources (Abulase 1973: 549). The derivatory affixation of the forms points to their descriptive nature. The vocalic shape of the Megrelian cognate regularly corresponds to the zero ablaut grade of its Georgian match. Is there any relation to the preceding stem? | | Fähnrich (1987: 36).
298



*ckwar- : ckwr
GZ *ckwar- : ckwr- 'to screw up, narrow eyes': Georg, ckur- 'to blink, wink; to narrow eyes'; Megr. ckur- 'to screw up, narrow eyes'. Verb stem. The unbound forms contain the zero grade. In Megrelian (action noun ckurua-} a derivative ckur-in- 'to put out eyes' is formed by means of the causative affix. Georgian-Zan substantive *ckwaram'darkness, abyss' seems to be related to the stem (though its wordforming structure is not quite transparent). The inherited character of Svan ckuru- 'crack, slit' remains questionable. | | klimov (1982: 163).
GZ *ckwar-am- 'darkness; abyss': Georg, ckvaram-, skvaram'darkness; abyss'; Megr. ckurum- 'darkness; chasm'. Although the word-forming structure of the word is opaque a relation to the verb stem *ckwar- : ckwr- is seems possible. The Georgian dialectal form with initial s (ylonti 1984: 497) seems to be due to the impact of the stem skw- 'to tie up'. According to Topuria (cf. 1979: 204) it illustrates a spirantization process. The Georgian dialectal (Lecx.) form ruckum— is a Zanism showing the effects of metathesis. The Megrelian form (n)ckvaram- derives from Georgian. ||Klimov(1985: 177).
GZ(?) *ckwert- 'to twist': Georg, ckvert- 'to twist'; Megr. ckimont-, ckdmont-.
A rather problematic juxtaposition. The phonetic correspondences in the stems compared remain quite unclear. Taking into account other cases of the correspondence of Zan n to Georgian r, the adequacy of this equation is not ruled out. The semantically deviating Megr. ckventere- 'straight; sharp' is formally closer to the Georgian stem (cf! Penrixi-Sar^vela3e 1990: 447). | | SSKJa: 244-245.
GZ *ckint-l- 'excrement, droppings (of birds)': Georg, ckintl-, skint (l)'excrement, droppings (of birds)'; Megr. ckintil-; Laz ckintil-, Svan
Represented in Old Georgian as skintl- (Sar^ve^e 1995: 193). Besides it may be discerned in the derivative action noun skintlva- 'to excrete' (Abula3e 1973: 399). Georgian dialectal (Ing.) cklint- shows a metathesis. The word is based on the verb stem *ckend- by adding the nominalizing affix *-/. The Zan lexeme regularly corresponds to the
299



*ckip
Georgian one, though in the latter the sporadic change c > s and loss of the word-final consonant may occur. Similar Svan form may be borrowed from Megrelian. | | USKJa: 245.
GZ *ckip- 'flick': Georg, clap- 'flick'; Megr. \ckip-]. Unattested in Old Georgian. The word belongs to a series of apophonic deverbative formations with the vowel / from *ckep- 'to split, to cut (into small parts)'. The Megrelian equivalent may be extracted from ckipurt-.
GZ *ckipart- 'flick, fillip': Georg, ckipart- 'flick, fillip'; Megr.
···· ··.·
ckipurt—.
Unattested in Old Georgian. The archetype has a non-transparent word-forming structure, although in its first part we have *ckip- 'flick' (Adj. cklipart- and Ing. cipartkl- are secondary forms). The regular sound correspondences are maintained consistently: in Megrelian the expected ο results in u in adjacency to labial p. In Georgian a ckipurtvariant is also widely known. The Svan ckipart, ckipart with the same meaning have a Georgian source.
CK *ckir- 'thin stick; twig': Georg, ckir- 'thin stick; twig'; Megr. ckir'sharpen (pointed) stick'; Svan ckir- 'splinter; thorn'. Unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language it occurs in the Psav. dialect (yionti 1984: 709). Whether Laz mckil- 'sharpened' belongs here remains disputable. Cf. also the Svan diminutive ckirild. The word must be treated as an apophonic derivative with the vocalism / based on the verb stem *cker-: ckr- 'to cut into small pieces'. | | Nadareisviii (1974: 145).
GZ *ckmu- 'to whine (about dog)': Georg, ckmu- 'to whine (about dog)'; Megr. ckum-; Laz ckum-.
Onomatopoeic verb stem attested in Old Georgian (Sar|vela3e 1995: 270). In accordance with its sound type it belongs to such stems as *bzu-, *zmu-, *ymu-. Its action nouns are Georg, ckmu-il, Megr. and Laz ckmu—in. Cf. also the enlarged parallel verb formation ckmut—un— in Georgian. The sound correspondences are regular. | | USKJa: 245.
GZ *cmart- 'calf (of leg)': Georg, [cmart-] 'calf; Megr. cimort-, csmort—.
300



*cow
In Old Georgian sources its continuant is found in the derivative sa-cmart-ul- 'sort of trousers' (cf. Abula3e 1973: 381). In modern Georgian the form sa-cmert-ul- occurs alongside the old one. Judging by the inner form of the word it first denoted long trousers covering calves. 1 1 T. Gudava. Cf. USKJa: 245.
GZ *cow- 'to suck': Georg, cov- 'to suck'; Megr. c(v)-; Laz c(v)-. A verb stem well known in Old Georgian (gamoscovs sisxlta '(he) will suck out the blood' Job 6.4; action noun cova-). In the Zan correspondence (cf. action nouns Megr. cuala-, Laz o-c-u) the final v is lost in position before u. Due to the descriptive character of the stem numerous parallels can be found in North Caucasian and other languages. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 48). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 392).
GZ *con- 'to weigh': Georg, con- 'to weigh'; Megr. con-; Laz con-, ein-.
Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian texts (conit ayconna... '(he) thoroughly weighted...' Job 6.2). The Zan continuant is regularly identical to the Georgian one. In Laz the variant ein- occurs too. Cikobava claimed a connection of the stem with *cw-en— 'to see, show'. | | Cikobava (1938: 401).
GZ *cr-ed- : cr-id- : cr-d- 'to filter, strain': Georg, cret- : crit- : crt'to filter, strain, flow down'; Megr. cirad- : cirid- : cird- 'to filter, strain; to be filtered'; Laz crod- : curd-. The verb stem is represented in Old Georgian (dacridos sisxli misi 'the blood ... shall be wrung out' Lev. 1.15; action noun dacreda-, mocreda-). The stem is formed from the base *cur- by means of the old extension *-ed : -id (cf. Marr 1911-1914 V: 180). The Georgian and Megrelian cognates reflect three ablaut grades. Georg, cert-il- 'point' seems to be its derivative (for the semantics cf. Lit. taskas 'point' parallel to taskyti 'to splash, sprinkle'). The history of the Laz continuants (cf. action noun o-curd-in-u) seems to be less clear. The similar Svan verb stem ncsrdwith the inorganic n typical of Zan must be a recent borrowing. Arm. crtel 'to defecate (of birds)' and cirt, cird 'dung of bird' alongside their possible PIE links (cf. Dzaukjan 1967.2: 257-258) show suspicious resemblance to the Georgian forms. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Cikobava (1928: 402). Megrelian: (1979: 37).
301



*cred-il
GZ *cred-il- 'filtered, strained': Georg, [cretil-] 'filtered, strained'; Megr. ciradil-, caradil-.
Unattested in Old Georgian sources. In modern Georgian the form is reflected in its derivative dacretil- with the same meaning. It is a past participle in -il based on the verb stem *cred- : crid- : crd- 'to filter, strain'. | | Cf.Rogava (1962: 79).
GZ *cr-ex- : cr-ix- 'to twist, weave; interlace': Georg, crex- : crix- 'to twist, weave; interlace'; Megr. cirox-, cirix-. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. A connection with *cur- is not ruled out. Anyhow the historical extension *-ex : -ix can be detached from it. In Georgian the stem is typical of Imer., Gur., and some mountain dialects (yionti 1984:197,711). The Megrelian action noun is ciroxua-. Formally the mil grade of the Megrelian stem corresponds more properly to the Georgian one in the parallel da-crax—n-a— 'to twist tightly'. 1 1 F hnrich (1987: 36).
GZ *crip— 'to cheep, peep': Georg, crip— 'to squeak, cheep'; Laz tip- 'to cheep, peep'. Unattested in Old Georgian. It is an obvious onomatopoeic formation (cf. Lit.cypti 'to cheep'). The action nouns are Georg, crip-in- (cf. also crip-cnpl) and Laz (Arx.) o-cip-u (cf. kincik cipoms 'bird peeps'). In Laz the word-inner r is regularly lost.
GZ *cumb- // cump- 'to become wet, be soaked with water': Georg. cump- 'to become wet,be soaked with water'; Megr. cump- 'to become wet, be bespattered'; Laz cump—, comp—. The verb stem is attested in Old Georgian with metathesis in the form mcub— (γόη imcuba sagorelsa mcwirisasa 'the sow ... was wallowing in the mire' II Peter 2.22; action noun mcubeba-}. The stem characterizes West Georgian dialects. Taking into account the derivative cumbe- 'mire' adduced by S. Orbeliani (modern variant cumpe-) one may reconstruct also the protoform *cumb- (cf.Ertelisvili 1976: 165). For the Zan languages cf. the action nouns Megr. documpua- and Laz o-cump-u alongside their respective attributives documper- and cumper-. The parallelism with PIE *suomb(h)o- 'spongy, porous' deserves attention. ||Klimov(1991: 111-116).
302



*cur
CK *cur- 'to press, squeeze out; to flow out': Georg, cur- 'to press, squeeze out; to flow out'; Megr. cur-, c3r-\ Laz (n)cor-, (n)cz'r- 'to press, squeeze'; Svan cwr-, cur— 'to squeeze out'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (gamovcure sasumelsa sina... '(I) pressed them into ... cup...' Gen. 40.11; action noun curva-). From this base the stems *cr—ed: cr—id- : cr—d— and apparently *cr—ex— : cr—ix- are derived. The Svan action noun is li-cwr-e (the Svan form new- 'to empty; to filter' with the inorganic n characteristic for Zan must have been borrowed). The stem bears a descriptive character, which explains its parallels in some other languages of the Caucasus. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 402). Svan: F hnrich (1987: 36).
GZ *cur- 'to sink; to fall; to bend, bow': Georg, cur- 'to bend, bow'; Megr. cur- 'to sink; to fall'. Attested in Old Georgian texts (cf. Penrixi-Sar^velase 1990: 452). The Georgian action noun is micurva-. For the Megrelian cf. action noun ila-cur-ua- and past participle u^i-ila-cur-il- 'with lowered ears'. 1 1 Sardschweladse (1985: 25).
GZ *cuc-wn- 'to suck, suck out': Georg. cuc(v)n- 'to suck, suck out'; Megr. curcon—; Laz cicon—.
The verb stem has a Georgian variant cuckn-. The stem contains the no longer productive extension *-wn. r of the Megrelian form is secondary. Topuria believed that Svan cusd— (action noun li—cusd-αη—ί) with the same meaning belongs also here (cf. IKE XII, 1960: 152). The expressive character of the stem seems quite obvious. According to Acaryan (1973: 471) the Arm. stem cue- underlying ccel 'to suck' derives from a Kartvelian source. Cf. also Vogt (1938: 332). 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 403). Megrelian: Schmidt (1962: 155).
GZ *cq- 'to feel hurt (by); to resent': Georg, cq-en- : cq-in- 'to feel hurt (by); to resent'; Megr. cq-in-; Laz ck-un- 'to ache, hurt'. Verb stem represented in Old Georgian sources (momecqina cxorebaj... Ί am weary of life...' Gen. 27.46). Georgian -en : -in and Laz -un are likely to be former affixes of the causative. The correspondence between Megr. q and dialectal Laz k is regular. The semantic deviation of the Laz form does not seem serious enough to cause doubts about its relation to the rest of the material. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 384). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 399^00).
303



*cq(a)
GZ *cq(a)- 'to measure off': Georg, cq- 'to measure off'; Megr. [rcq-]. Verb stem is found in Old Georgian: cf. the action noun micqva- and a derivative sacqaul- 'measure' (Abu^e 1973: 254). Cf. also modern Georg, sacqao- 'measure'. For Megrelian the stem may be identified in the substantive o-rcq-e- 'measure' where r is an inorganic element. A connection with stem *cqw- 'to lay; to pack, arrange' is not ruled out (the stem *cqaw— : cqw— ?).
1 1 Sardschweladse (1987: 23).
GZ *cqa- 'water': Georg, cqal- 'water'; Megr. cqar-; Laz cka(r)-, car-. The protoform is extremely difficult to reconstruct correctly. The word is widely attested in Old Georgian (mec me cqali 'give me water' Jn. 4.10). The nature of its vocalism makes it possible to assume either a secondary origin of the final sonorant in the Zan forms (in which case the word will be placed in the same set with the protoforms *bark-, *maqw-, *prck-, and the like) or a borrowing of the lexeme in the Zan languages from Georgian. The latter point of view has been defended by Marr and Cikobava. Cf. also Schmidt (1960: 156). In this case a most unusual borrowing of a lexeme from the basic vocabulary would have to be acknowledged (see in this connection Cikobava 1942: 21). The supposed connection of the word with *rc\qaw- : rclqw- 'to sprinkle' (cf. Vogt 1954: 544) needs additional argumentation. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 60). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 182).
GZ *cqa(w)- 'cherry-laurel': Georg, cqav- 'cherry-laurel'; Megr. cqol-\ Laz mcko(l)—, (m)cu—.
For the correspondence between Georg, v and Zan / in stem-final position: cf. *zaku(w)-, *pe(w)-, *te(w)-, *xwe(w)-. The Zan vocalism points to the primary nature of the word-final consonant. The initial m of the Laz forms must be secondary. The correspondence Megr. q ~ dialectal Laz k is regular. Marr considered the lexeme to have been borrowed from Georgian, which is apparently true for the parallel Megr. cqe- and cqi-. The Svan cqaw-, cqew- with the same meaning are hardly very old. 1 1 Georgian, Zan': Marr (1915.1 II: 832), Cikobava (1938: 130).
GZ *cqecq- 'to pinch, squeeze; to press': Georg, cqecq- 'to pinch; to press'; Megr. cqacq-. Unattested in Old Georgian. The reduplicated structure points to a descriptive nature of the verb. Action nouns are Georg, cqecqva- and
304



*cqw
Megr. cqacqua-. The regular correspondence in vocalism points to the inherited character of the stem. 1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 38).
CK *cqw— 'to lay; to pack, arrange'; Georg. cq(v)— 'to lay; to pack, arrange'; Megr. ncqv-; Laz cq-, ck- 'to regulate, assemble, make friends'; Svan sq- 'to make, to arrange'. Represented in Old Georgian (daicqvna qelni daperqni... '(he) folded arms and legs...' Sin. mr. 272.3-4; action noun dacqoba-). Georg, cqvil'pair' is derived from this stem. The initial « of the Megrelian form (action noun ncquala-} must be secondary. The formally corresponding Laz form (action noun me—cq—v-en—u) deviates to a certain extent semantically. In the Svan analogue (action noun li-sq- ) the old c underwent spirantization. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1896 I: 51). Laz: Topuria (IKE XII, 1960: 154). Svan: Sardschweladse (1987: 23).
GZ *cqw- 'to destroy, husk': Georg, cqv- 'to destroy, annihilate'; Megr. ncqv-, ncq-, cq- 'to destroy'; Svan ncqw- (?).
The Georgian stem is extracted from such word-forms as ga-cqv-a- 'it destroyed', ga-cqv-eb-a- 'it will be destroyed'. For the Megrelian cf. action noun ncquala- and ncqvir- 'destroyed'. The Svan action noun is li-ncqw-e, whose phonetic shape perhaps points to a Zan source. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Sardschweladse (1985: 25). Svan: Fähnrich (1987: 37).
CK (?) *C!abl- 'chestnut': Georg, cabl- 'chestnut'; Megr. cubur-, Laz cubu(r)-, cubr-; Svan heb-ra-, jeb-ra- 'cherry(-tree)' (?).
Attested in Old Georgian in the same from (Sar^velaje 1995: 257), it may be discerned in its derivative mo-cabl-e 'chestnut-colored' (Abulage 1973: 287 and 531). Zan forms regularly correspond to the Georgian word. The relation of the Svan lexeme, which is in phonetic agreement with the rest of material (cf. the regular change *c, > h //j and the usual loss of the word-final / alongside the suffix -ra which forms names of plants and trees), remains tentative because of its essential
305



*c,ad- : Cjd
deviation in meaning. According to Kapancjan (1975: 369), Arm. (dial.) cyopur 'nut' goes back to Megr. cubur-. |'| Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 13). Laz, Svan: Marr (1915.1 II: 825).
CK *Cjad- : Cid- 'to wish, desire': Georg, cad- 'to wish, desire'; Svan had-: hd(w}-.
The verb stem is well known in Old Georgian (scadoda ... xilvaj misi 'he was desirous to see him' Lk. 23.8; action noun cadil—). In Zan languages its continuant seems to be unattested. The Svan cognate is characterized by the development *c, > h (cf. action noun li-hdw-i, li-wad-i). The nature of the mobile w needs clarification. | | Marr (1914: 37).
GZ *Cjat- 'cudgel': Georg, cat- 'cudgel, club'; Megr. cort- 'pole'. The lexeme is well attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 531) and seemingly absent in the modern language. Usually one assumes a later development of r in the Megrelian cognate, however, phonetically more close to the latter is Old Georg, calt- 'kind of axe' (cf. Abula3e 1973: 531). In both cases the forms are comparable. There is an action noun (do)cortua- 'to beat with cudgel, club' in Megrelian. 1 1 D. Macavariani (1975: 48-^9).
CK *Ciam- 'morning': Megr. cume 'to-morrow'; Laz cume-, Svan ham 'morning'. No certain cognate is found in Georgian. The correspondence Zan c ~ Svan h presupposes *Ci of the protolanguage. Laz cuman- 'morning' forms a link between the Zan and Svan forms since it ends in «, which can be identified in other adverbial formations. | | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 196). Svan: Schmidt (1961: 151).
CK(?) *c,am- // ctem- 'grass': Georg, [cam-} 'grass'; Laz (n)cam'medicine, drug'; Svan cem 'hay' (?). In Georgian it may be extracted from the derivatives carnal- 'medicine, drug' and ler-cam- 'reed'; both are attested in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 531, 208). For the cases of a correspondence Georg, a ~ Svan e see *3\ayl—, *clabl—. Much more problematic seems to be a connection of these forms with Megr. (r)cem- and Svan cima- 'pubes'. ||Rogava(1945:231-232).
306



- :c,n
GZ *Cian- : ctn- 'to braid, plait, weave': Georg, can- : en- 'to braid, plait, weave'; Megr. [ein-, can-]; Laz [cm-, cun-]. Verb stem identifiable in Old Georgian in the derivative cnel- 'branch, twig' (Abulase 1973: 549) which reflects Georgian-Zan *c,n-e/-. Cf. further Rustaveli 760.3. Contrary to Georgian, where the stem is used in its unbound form, which shows two ablaut grades, the Zan cognates can be extracted only from the more complex descendants. Sometimes one includes here also the second part of *$\eci(w)n- 'willow' (cf. Cikobava (1942: 33). ||Klimov(1973:366).
GZ *c,ar- 'to anger, be angry; to irritate, be irritated': Georg, [car-] 'to anger, be angry; to grieve'; Megr. cor— 'to calm down, cool down'. In Georgian the verb stem can be extracted from the derivative mcare'bitter', which is represented in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973:309). Its Megrelian equivalent can be found in the verb gito-cor-ap-a- 'to calm down, cool down'. The Georgian dialectal (Imer.) gan—cor-eb-a— with the same meaning is an obvious Zan borrowing. (1956: 247-248).
GZ *c,arb- 'eyebrow': Georg, carb- 'eyebrow'; Megr. [cob-]. Well attested in Old Georgian texts (carbta cemta zeda... On my eyelids (brows)...' Job 16.17), where its derivatives are also found. Cf. Sar^velaje (1995: 257).Although at present its regular Megrelian correspondence has been replaced by the Georgian loanword car- it was still recorded in Brosset (1849: 74). | | Cf. £SKJa: 248.
CK *c,(e)- : c,(i>- 'to pull, stretch; to reach': Georg, ce- : ci- 'to pull, stretch; to reach, attain'; Megr. (n)c- 'to reach, attain'; Laz nc- 'to reach; to ripen'; Svan (m)h- 'to ripen'. Verb stem well known in Old Georgian (icie da arku\ Overtake (them) and say!' Gen. 44.4; action noun mocev(n)a-). The Georgian forms preserve the ablaut alternation. The Zan cognates usually have a secondary n (cf.action nouns Megr. ncapa-, Laz o-nc-u). In their Svan equivalent (action noun li-4jn)h-e, li-h-ί) m is equally optional, whereas h regularly reflects the former *c,. | | Georgian, Svan: Marr (1918: 333). Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 388).
307



GZ *cteb- 'to glue': Georg, ceb- 'to glue'; Megr. cab-; Laz cab-. Verb stem occurring in Old Georgian: kari semoiceba zurgit '(he) shut the door after him' Gen. 19.6; action noun dacebva- (Sar^velase 1995: 73). It must be viewed as a verbal derivative from the noun *c\ebo'mistletoe; gum'. The Zan form (action noun Megr. cabua-, Laz me-cab-u) regularly corresponds to the Georgian one. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 110). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 406).
GZ *C!ebo- 'mistletoe, gum': Georg, cebo- 'gum, glue'; Megr. cabu-; Laz cabu— 'mistletoe, gum'. Attested in Old Georgian texts (Abulage 1973: 541). In word-final position the correspondence Georg, ~ Zan u is regular. Svan cäb, cäbr 'mistletoe' must be regarded as a Zan loanword. The lexeme reflects the tradition of extracting glue from mistletoe which has been followed in Western Georgia till recent times. Arm. cep '(-o) 'putty' seems to be borrowed from Georgian (cf. Acafyan 1973: 453; Vogt 1939: 332). | | Cf. &SKJa: 248.
CK(?) *C!el- 'gut(s), intestines': Georg, eel- 'waist, loin; intestine' Megr. ci—, C9— 'gut, intestine'; Laz cu—, mcu—; Svan [cil—]. Found in Old Georgian sources (iqvned celni tkuenni mortqmul 'let your loins be girded' Lk. 12.35). In modern Georgian the plural form cel-eb- means 'intestines' and eel- refers to 'waist, loin'. The word illustrates a correspondence between Georg, -el and Zan -u in noun formations. Cf. the Megrelian derivative o-c-is- 'waist, loin'. The Laz cognate may contain an inorganic word-initial m. The Svan match is extracted from the reduplicative formation cincil- with the same meaning (however, its antiquity seems disputable). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 69-70). Svan: Fähnrich (1987: 37).
GZ(?) *cten- 'to summon, invite': Georg, [can-] 'to invite'; Megr. can'to call, appeal'; Laz cand- 'to invite'. The verb stem may be traced in Old Georgian can- 'feast, banquet' which can be interpreted as a form of the action noun (cf. also Laz canda'invitation; wedding, marriage procession'). The Georgian stem possibly points to the old non-functional alternation e // a. Megr. action noun is canapa-. The extra d in Laz (cf. action noun o-cand-u) needs ex

*c,enga
planation. A different point of view on the connections of the Zan material has been expressed by Cikobava (1938: 406). 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Marr. Megrelian: £SKJa: 249.
GZ *C!enga- 'weed'(?): Georg, cenga- 'kind of grass'; Laz canga'weed (Cynodon dactylon)'. In modern Georgian the noun occurs in the Mtiul. dialect (yionti 1984: 699). The Laz form regularly corresponds to the Georgian one. The affixal nature of the word-final a is not ruled out. | i F hnrich (1987: 37).
CK *c,er- : c,r- 'to scratch; to depict': Georg, cer- 'to write; to depict'; Megr. (n)car-\ Laz (n)car-, ca(r)-; Svan (f)r-.
Widely known in Old Georgian: cf. dacere otxmeoci 'write fourscore' Lk. 16.9. The primary meaning of the stem is preserved in Georg. $varis dacera 'to depict a cross', i.e. 'to cross oneself. Cf. dial. (Kiziq) cerva'to make paintings on windows and doors', (Moxev.) ga-cera- 'to depict a line', etc. The Zan forms (action noun Megr. canta-, Laz o-ncar-u) often develop a secondary n. In Svan *c, is regularly lost, and compensatory lengthening has developed (cf. the Svan action noun Γι-r-e). One of the derivatives of the stem is *m-c{er-. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 74). Laz, Svan: Marr (1914: 37).
GZ *C!ero- 'crane': Georg, cero- 'crane'; Megr. [caro-] 'fishing bird'. ' In the form mcero- the word is attested in Old Georgian: ...da mceroni da sasuni '...and cranes and thrushes' (Abulase 1973: 309). Its regular Megrelian equivalent can be seen in the form caro- which is mentioned in the dictionary of S. Orbeliani and possibly is retained in the Megrelian surname Caraia. However, a similar Svan carw- is an obvious Georgian loanword. The Kartvelian word may eventually derive from the IndoEuropean designation of the crane (cf. PIE *ger(o)-). 1 1 Rogava (1988.2: 59-60).
GZ *CiCC!- 'to tangle, get tangled; to string, thread': Georg, cec- 'to get tangled; be mixed'; Megr. cac- 'to string, thread'. Unattested in Old Georgian sources. The Georgian and Megrelian stems regularly correspond to each other (cf. their respective action nouns
309



*c,w
cecva- and cacua-). Their semantic deviation remains within admissible limits. The Georgian match has a connotation 'to scutch wool'. By Kartvelian sound-symbolic rules the stem seems related to GZ *$e(n)$- 'to scutch (flax)'. Arm. cecel with the same meaning alongside its assumed Indo-European links (cf. Acaryan 1973: 451) is suspiciuosly close to the Georgian form.
CK *CjW- 'to bake, fry': Georg, cv- 'to burn; to fry'; Megr. c(v}- 'to burn; to ache; to fry'; Laz c(v)-; Svan c- 'to bake, scorch'. Verb stem widely represented in Old Georgian: bzej igi dacuas '(he) will burn up the chaff' Mt. 3.12; action noun dacua— and dacuva—. In the Zan cognate (action noun Megr. cua-, cuala-, Laz o-c-u) the final v disappears before u. The respective Svan stem is represented by the consonant c: action noun li-c-i; cf. äci '(he) scorches, bakes'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 66). Laz: lavaxisvili (1913: 6). Svan: Macavariani (1965: 29).
GZ *Ciwart- : c,wrt- 'to run (adroitly); to exercise, train': Georg. cvrt-n- 'to exercise, train'; Megr. cvirt- 'to run (adroitly)'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian texts, where it preserved the ablaut alternation and a wider meaning: cf. action noun cuart(n)a- and past participle curt-il- (Abula£e 1973: 550). For the Megrelian cognate reflecting zero grade cf. the action noun cvirt-ap- and the parallel adjective cvirt— 'dexterous, bold, lively'.
CK *CjWed- : c,wd- 'to give, to serve': Georg, cyd- 'to let, grant'; Svan hod- : hwd- 'to give; to sell'. Verb stem is well known from Old Georgian (cf. action noun cudoma-). The stems compared correspond to each other. The historical ablaut alternation has been retained at present only in Svan: action noun li—hwd—i; cf. hodi < *hwedi 'he sells'.
1 1 Georgian, Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 205).
GZ *Ciwet- : c^t- 'to drip, drop': Georg, cvet- 'to drip, drop'; Megr. cvat-\ Laz [cot-].
Verb stem attested in Old Georgian texts (coscuta nacueti misi 'his drop fell' Bal. 6.9), where it still retained the ablaut alternation. In the Zan branch it functions independently in Megrelian (action noun cvat-ap-). Their Laz equivalent may be traced back in the derivative o-cot-ur-a
310



'rubbish heap, dump in the yard'. There exists also a related noun stem (see below). | | Cf. ESKJa: 250.
GZ *c,wet- 'drop': Georg, cvet- 'drop'; Megr. cvat-, cvet-; Laz [tot-]'
Noun correlate of the preceding stem. In Old Georgian it is represented in the form of cuet- (Abulase 1973: 551). One may assume that Georg, cut- 'minute' is related with the word. For the Laz correspondence see the preceding entry. The tentative comparison with Svan \ved'drop, dew' expressed formerly in (ESKJa: 250) seems to be very problematic. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 66). Laz: ESKJa: 250.
GZ *C!wel— 'to milk': Georg, cvel— 'to milk'; Megr. cval—; Laz (m}cval—, (ri)cval-.
Verb stem documented in Old Georgian (cf. Abulase 1973: 551). The Laz form has optional word-initial morn. From this stem are formed the derivatives *c\wel-a- and *me-c\wel-. In the past one suggested an earlier suffixal character of the sequence el and connection of the stem with *c}wet- (Cikobava 1938: 409). The relation between the Georgian-Zan material and the Svan li-cw-e 'to crumple' requires argumentation. | | Georgian, Zan: $avaxisvili (1913:6).
GZ *c,wel-a- 'daily yield of milk': Georg, cvela- 'daily yield of milk, cheese (of one milking)'; Megr. cvala-. Noun correlate of the preceding verb. It is attested in Old Georgian (nu ixilos cuelaj... 'he shall not see the floods (of milk)...' Job 20.17). By its origin it is an action noun. The Georgian and Megrelian forms regularly correspond to each other. | | Cikobava (1938: 409).
GZ *c,wer- 'tip, point': Georg, ever- 'tip, point; beard'; Megr. cvand— 'tip, top'; Svan were, \var(e) 'beard'(?). The word is widely represented in Old Georgian (tavi da cueri.. . 'head and beard. ..' Krest. 162.36; note the derivative mcuerval- 'top, peak'). Its verb correlate is *ctwer- (see below). The Megrelian cognate presupposes the intermediate step *cvan^- and subsequent dissimilation. In Laz the
311



word seems to be lost. The meaning 'beard' must be secondary. The relation of the Svan form remains doubtful. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Janashvili (cf. Erckert 1895:296). Svan: Wardrop (1911:594).
GZ *Cjwer- 'to root out, stub out (a field)'; Georg, ever- 'to root out, stub out (a field)'; Megr. cvar-\ Laz ncvar- 'to weed'. Verbal correlate of the noun *c1wer—. The Georgian (Raca dial.) and Zan forms regularly correspond to each other phonetically. The meaning of the Laz stem deviates. The verb is a typical term of settled agriculture common only for Georgian and the Zan languages. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: D. Macavariani (1970: 92-96). Laz: Klimov (1985: 177).
CK *Ciwer- 'to set, disappear (of the sun)': Georg, ever- 'to set, disappear (of the sun); Svan huer-, werUnattested in Old Georgian. For modern Georgian cf. action noun cverva-; i-cver-eb-a 'disappears (of the sun)'. No Zan cognates are found. For Svan cf. action noun li—hwer, li—wer and li—m—her 'West'. 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 37).
GZ *Ciwim- 'to rain': Georg, cvim- 'to rain, to pour'; Megr. cvim-, cvem-\ Laz (m)cim-, (m)cvim-.
Verb stem well known from Old Georgian (cvimn martalta zeda... '(he) sendeth rain on the just...' Mt. 5.45). In Megrelian there is also a variant with vocalism e. The Laz form often contains an inorganic initial m. In the past one assumed a suffixal character of the sequence im (cf. Cikobava 1938: 409). 1 1 Schuchardt (1902.2: 394).
GZ *c1wim-a- 'rain': Georg, cvima- 'rain'; Megr. cvima-, cvema-; Laz (m)cima—, (m)cvima—.
Widely known in Old Georgian: gardamoqda cvimaj 'the rain descended' Mt. 7.25 (its variant cuma— also occurs). It is an action noun derived from the verb stem *c,H7'w-. The Laz word may contain an inorganic initial m. The origin of the Megrelian variant with e needs elucidation. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 76). Laz: Schuchardt (1902.2: 394).
312



*c,wisi
GZ *c,wis,- 'to attain': Georg, [cvw-] 'to attain, reach'; Megr. cis-\ Laz cis- 'to attain, reach; to mature'. Verb stem. In Georgian it may be traced in the noun derivative mcwis'grown up' (Abula3e 1973: 312), which in its turn serves as the basis for the denominative verb. The Zan form has lost a glide v but in other respects it regularly corresponds to the Georgian one. Cf. the action nouns Megr. cisapa- and Laz me-cis-u.
| | Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 404-405). Georgian: Gigineisvili (1972: 151).
GZ *Ciit- 'to redden, become red': Georg, cit- 'to redden, become red'; Megr. [cit-]; Laz [αϊ-]. In its unbound state the verb stem is attested only in Old Georgian (cits caj 'the sky is red' Mt. 16.2). By means of the derivatory affix -el it forms the adjective *Ciit-el- whose continuants make it possible to trace the stem in both Zan languages. Marr (1915.1, II: 778) believed the stem to have originated from the protoform *cvit-.
GZ *c,it-el- 'red': Georg, eitel- 'red'; Megr. cita-\ Laz (m)cita-. The adjective is widely used in Old Georgian (umgobes ars cuncubasa citelsa... '(it is) better then red sulphur...' Bal. 28.9). It is based on the stem of the stative verb *c} it—. The cognates are phonetically regular. The Laz correspondence may contain an augmentation m. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Rosen (1945: 3).
GZ *Ciiku- 'tiny, wee; small things': Georg, ciku- 'smallest; crumb'; Megr. ciku- 'small, little'. Unattested in Old Georgian. In modern Georgian it is a dialectal (Tus.) word. Cf. also the Kartl. derivative ciko-mako- 'small things' (yionti 1984: 702). 1 1 F hnrich.
GZ *Ciirpl- 'pus (in the eye)': Georg, cirpl- 'pus (in the eye)'; Megr. cirp-. Unattested in Old Georgian. The phonetic correspondences between the Georgian and Megrelian lexemes are regular. For the loss of the final / in the Zan languages see *tes—l—, *opl—, cqintl—, etc. Arm. cipr with the same meaning is a loanword from Zan (cf. Acafyan 1977: 201; Vogt 1938: 332).
313



*C[irx- : c,rx
GZ *Ciirx- : c\r\- 'to twitter, chirp (about swallow)': Georg, [rcx-] 'to twitter, chirp (about swallow)'; Megr. cirx—. In its unbound form the verb stem occurs only in Megrelian: cf. cirx-ol'to chirp (of swallow), babble'. Its descriptive nature is rather felt and draws it closer together with similar forms in some other languages of the Caucasus and beyond it. Cf. also Megr. cirx-in- 'neighing (of horse)'. Among derivatives of the stem is Georg.-Zan *me-c\rx—al— 'swallow'.
GZ *c1ic1il- 'chick, chicken': Georg, cicil-a- 'chick, chicken'; Laz
w vT
cucul-.
A problematic equation. The end of the Georgian word contains the evaluation suffix -a. The symbolic nature of the lexeme denoting a small object causes a defective correspondence in the vocalic shape of the material. 1 1 Megrelidze (1938: 173).
GZ *CiinaSi— 'to interlace, twist': Georg, cmas—n— 'to weave, interlace tightly'; Megr. cimos-, cumos- 'to twist, tie up (tobacco leaves)'; Laz (n)cimos- 'to interlace, twist'. Verb stem represented in Old Georgian texts: cf. the action noun cmasna-, cmasnva— (Abulaje 1973: 549). An extraction of the affix —as (cf. Vogt 1947.1: 48) needs argumentation. There exists also the Georgian dialectal variant tmas-n-. The correspondences between the forms are regular. While in Laz (action noun o~cimos-u) the meaning of the stem remains sufficiently broad (cf. its connotation 'to be struck dumb') in Megrelian it underwent a narrowing. \\£SKJa:25\.
GZ *c,n- 'to press': Georg, en- 'to press'; Megr. [ein-]; Laz [ein-]. In its unbound state the verb stem is preserved only in Georgian (action noun cneva—). The stem serves as a basis for derivative *c\n-ex— : c^n—ixwhich makes it possible to trace it in both Zan languages.
GZ *c,n-el- 'twig': Georg, cnel- 'twig, birch'; Megr. cin(u)-, csn9-\ cunu-, cinu-, cino-.
Deverbative formation represented in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 549). In the modern language a dialectal (Gur.) variant cknel- (yionti 1984: 709) is also known. The lexeme is derived from the verb stem *c1an— : c,n—. Its end shows the correspondence Georg, -el ~ Zan -u. | | Georgian, Laz: Marr (1910: 228). Megrelian: Caraja (1912: 49).
314



GZ *C!n-ex- : c,n-ix
GZ *c,n-ex- : c,n-ix- 'to press; to squeeze': Georg, cnex- : cnix- 'to press (grapes)'; Megr. cinax- 'to press'; Laz cinax- 'to press; to squeeze'. Verbal formation attested in Old Georgian: cf. the action noun cnexa-, and the derivative participles cnexil- 'pressed' and mcnexar- 'pressing'. It is formed from a simple stem (see *c,«-) by means of the extension *-ex : -ix. In its turn the stem serves as a basis for the Georgian-Zan derivative *sa-c\nex-el-. The cognates are phonetically regular (cf. action noun Megr. cinaxua-, Laz o-cinax-u). In Megrelian the stem occurs also in the simplified form cox-. Arm. odns-el 'to press; to oppress' seems to be an old Zan borrowing. | | Georgian, Laz: lavaxisvili (1913: 6). Megrelian: Cikobava (1938: 396).
CK *c,rtxa- 'cubit, ell': Georg, cqrta- 'cubit, ell'; Megr. cqi(r)ta-, cqs(r)ta-\ Svan citx-.
The word is found in Old Georgian (or cqrta sigr$ej... 'two cubits (shall be) the length...' Ex. 25.23). The Megrelian form corresponds well phonetically to the Georgian one. The presence of the word-initial affricate in Svan proves that earlier it stood next to the sonant r (cf. Gamqreli3e 1968: 10). This assumption is supported by the existence of the Georgian derivative cirtxl- '(door-, window-)post'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 110). Svan: Klimov (1960: 24). Cf. USKJa: 254.
GZ *Ciip- 'to stretch; to reach': Georg, [crp-] 'to reach, attain; to be in time'; Megr. rcip-, rcip- 'to stretch'. In Georgian the verb stem can be identified in the derivative adjective crp-el- well known from Old Georgian. In Megrelian the stem is used as a verbal base; cf. action noun rcip-ap- // rcip-ap- (the second form contains an expressive p) showing metathesis of r. \ | Klimov (1985': 177-178).
GZ *Ciip-el- 'stretched, narrow': Georg, crpel- 'straight; right; true'; Megr. cirpa-, cripa- 'sort of long fish'; Laz mcipa- 'holy, sacred, pure'
The adjective is attested in Old Georgian with the meaning 'straight, true' (crpel qvenit alagni misni 'make his paths straight' Mt. 3.3). It is a derivative from the verb stem *c\rp- formed by means of the suffix -el. The comparison of the Georgian word with Megr. cipe- 'thin' proposed
315



*CiU
in Cikobava (1938: 231) is weakened by the final vocalism in Zan forms. The adduced Laz cognate significantly deviates in its semantics. Under these conditions the cited Megrelian word must be a regular Zan continuant of the archetype. 1 1 Klimov (1985: 17). Cf. Fähnrich (1987: 37).
CK *C!U- 'to hum, whistle': Georg, cu-il- 'to hum, buzz'; Svan CM-/- 'to whistle'. A verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. All forms correspond phonetically to each other. They belong to a number of descriptive stems derived by the characteristic affixes -il (in Georgian) and -/ (in Svan). 1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 38).
GZ *C!uk- 'copper cauldron': Georg, cuk-al-a- 'small copper cauldron'; Laz cuk— 'copper cauldron'. The Georgian word is attested in the Gur. dialect (ylonti 1984: 712). It contains diminutive suffixes. Its Laz equivalent has a derivative cuk-an'large cauldron'. Cf. also the vague Laz (Atina) cure- with the same meaning. 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Fähnrich (1975: 341).
GZ *CtUk- 'little, small': Georg, cuk- 'little, small'; Megr. cuk- 'mouse'. In Georgian the stem can be discerned in the dialectal (Moxev.) form cuk-an-ia-j 'little, small'. Since the Common Kartvelian word for 'mouse' is *tagw-, the meaning of the Megrelian form must be secondary (effects of taboo?). | | Fähnrich (1975: 341).
CK *c,ul- 'baby, child (male)': Georg, cul- 'baby, child (male, sometimes also female)'; Svan cus. Well known in Old Georgian sources (ganikurna culi igi... 'the child was cured...' Mt. 17.18; cf. its derivatives kal-cul- 'girl' and dis-cul'nephew'). It illustrates the correspondence Georg. / ~ Svan s at the end of nouns. In view of the Svan derivative na-cwl-as 'a kind of propertycompensation' *Ci must be reconstructed in word-initial position. | | Rogava (1951: 636). Cf. Penrixi-Sar$vela3e (1990: 467^68).
GZ *Ciurc,ul- 'to purl, murmur; to stream': Georg, curcul- 'to purl, murmur; to stream'; Megr. cvarcval- 'to splash; to stream'.
316



The reduplicative structure of the verb stem points to its descriptive nature. Cf. the correlation of the same type between Georgian and Megrelian forms descended from *3un$ul-. 1 1 Fähnrich (1982: 38).
GZ *c,qal- 'to feel sorry (for), to regret; to spare': Georg, cqal- 'to feel sorry, regret; to spare'; Megr. [cqol-} 'to provide charity, favor, mercy'. Verb stem documented in Old Georgian texts (mecqaleba me eri ese have compassion on the multitude' Mk. 8.2; cf. its derivatives cqaloba'mercy' and sacqal- 'pitiful'). In Megrelian the stem may be traced in a derivative cqolopua- 'charity'. 1 1 Cagareli (1880: 85).
GZ *ctqal- : Ciql- 'to injure, be wounded, be injured': Georg, cql- 'to injure, be injured'; Megr. cqol- 'to injure, be injured'. Verb stem well represented in Old Georgian: dacqles da carvides... '(they) wounded him and departed ...' Lk. 10.30 (action noun dacqlva-), where its meaning was much wider (Abulase 1973: 554). Cf. modern Georgian cqlul- 'ulcer, sore, wound'. In Megrelian the stem reflects a vocalism a; cf. the action noun cqolua-. The comparison leads to the reconstruction of the ablaut alternation. 1 1 Schmidt (1962: 157).
GZ *ctqan- Oak': Georg, [cqan-] Oak'; Megr. cqon-\ Laz (m)ckon-, mcon—.
In Georgian it can be discerned in the toponym Cqn-et- (village near Tbilisi). In Laz it frequently has secondary word-initial m. The diversity of modern designations of the oak in Kartvelian languages (cf. Georgian muxa- < Old Georgian muqa- and Svan ^i(h)ra-) is likely to be explained by tabooing of the inherited name of the tree, which was sacred for the ancient Kartvelians. For the taboo replacement of this term in IndoEuropean languages cf. Gamkrelidze-Ivanov (1995: 530-531). 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Marr (1912.1: 39). Georgian: Cikobava (1938: 128).
GZ *c,qar- 'quail': Georg, mcqer- 'quail'; Megr. cqor-, Svan sqäzw, sqezw (?).
Attested in Old Georgian textes (Abulaje 1973: 312). The initial m of the Georgian word seems to be an inorganic element. The - e-vocalism points to an umlaut effect on the pre-Georgian stage (cf. Sar^velaje 1985:
317



*c,qew- : c,qw
199). The identity of the stem-final r remains unclear: cf. the same pattern in *kwer-, *meser-, clxwar-. Since the Svan word shows instead of the expected r a consonant z (< £) one prefers sometimes to consider it a loanword from Zan (cf. Penrixi-Sar|vela3e 1990: 470). | | Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 75). All Kartvelian material is aligned in Marr (1914: 45).
GZ *Ciqew- : Cjqw- 'to curse, damn': Georg, cqev- 'to curse, damn'; Megr. cq(u)-.
Verb stem widely used in Old Georgian (...romeli hscqeve '...which thou cursedst' Mk. 11.21; action noun cqeva-). In modern Georgian the stem is enlarged with /: cf. the action noun cqevla-. The Megrelian cognate reflects the zero grade. Its final u is frequently absent (cf. action noun cq(u)ala- and past participle cqel-, cqer- 'cursed'). ||kipsidze(1914:393).
GZ *c,qen- : ο,ςίη- 'to bore, pester; be tired'; Georg, cqen- : cqin- 'to bore, pester; be tired'; Laz [ckin-] 'to be tired'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian where it meant 'to be tired; to upset, grieve'; action noun mocqineba- (Abula3e 1973: 289). In Laz the stem may be extracted from its derivative cqin-d— II ckin—d— (cf. action noun do-ckin-d-in-u 'to get tired'). 1 | Cikobava (1938: 414-^15).
CK(?) *Cjqer- : c,qr- 'to take offense (at); to be angry (with)': Georg. cqer- : cqr- 'to take offense (at)'; Megr. (n)cqor-; Svan [cqr-]?. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (guli gicqrebis... 'are ye angry...' Jn. 7.23; action noun cqroma-). The vowel of the Megrelian forms (action noun cqorin—) points to parallel a vocalism of the protoform (cf. Macavariani 1958: 266, 599). Their Svan correspondence can be seen in the form li-cqr-un-al 'to bristle' if it is not borrowed from Megrelian. I j Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 25). Cf. also Lafon (1952: 78). Svan: F hnrich (1987: 37).
GZ *c,q- 'i:o begin': Georg, cq- 'to begin'; Megr. cq- 'to begin; to intend'; Laz ck-, c—. Verb stem amply represented in Old Georgian (icqo sitquad '(he) began to say' Mk. 10.28; action noun dacqeba-). The Zan stem (cf. action nouns Megr. ge—cqap—a, Laz ge-cqap-u) regularly corresponds to the
318



*Ciqwed- : t^
Georgian one. In Laz, apart from the well-known development q > k, the consonant cluster may have been reduced. ||Schuchardt(1902.2:396).
CK *Cjqwed- : c,qwd- 'to break, tear': Georg, cqvet- : cqd- : cqvit- 'to break, tear; to cease, end; to decide'; Megr. cqvad— : cqud— : cqvid— 'to break, tear; to cease, end; to strike'; Laz ckvad- : cko(r)d- : ckvid-; Svan sqed- : sqd- 'to fall'.
Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (mocqvida qoveli qrmebi '(he) slew all the children' Mt. 2.16; action noun cqueda-). The expressive substitution d > t is common for Georgian. The stem preserves the ablaut alternation (cf. also the form sqad- in Svan). In Megrelian its zero-grade is seen in the form cqud- reflected also in a derivative mo-cqud-u 'bride', lit. 'alienated (from father's family)'. The Svan forms have lost w; their initial affricate underwent spirantization. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 110). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 413-414). Svan: Macavariani (1958: 273).
GZ *c,qurt- 'diabetes': Georg, cqurt- 'diabetes'; Megr. [cqurt-]. Apparently unknown from Old Georgian texts. It is not recorded in the Zan languages either. However, the Georgian dialectal (Lecx.) word cqurt— with the same meaning preserves a regular Zan correspondence being an old borrowing. Cf. also Lecx. macqurtia- of the same semantics and Mesx. verb stem cqurt- 'to drink hard'. 1 1 Alavi5e (1955: 12). '
CK *£am- : 6m- 'to eat': Georg, cam- : cm- 'to eat'; Megr. ckom-, ckum—i Laz ckom—, skom—\ Svan em—.
Verb stem amply represented in Old Georgian (seginebulita qelita camenpursa '(they) eat bread with unwashen hands' Mk. 7.5; action noun cama-, cf. camad- 'food'). Cf. a derivative *sa-cm-el- 'food, meal'. The Zan form regularly corresponds to the Georgian one. The changes ο > u and c > s are also known here. The Svan form (cf. la-l-em 'he ate' and
\
K-m-n-e 'to feed') as in some other cases goes back directly to the *c form and not to the ck reflex. The evident symbolic nature of the stem
319



*ced
explains its numerous analogies in languages of the Caucasus and beyond it. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 73). All the Kartvelian material is aligned in Marr (1914: 44—45).
CK *ied- 'to hammer in, nail': Georg, ced- 'to hammer in, nail; to shoe'; Megr. chad-, ckand- 'to nail; to shoe'; Laz c(k)ad-; Svan skad-. Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian: maxvili mcedeltagan ganicedis 'a sword is hammered (forged) by the smith' Sin. mr.97.21 (cf. action noun cedva- and cde- 'notch' which reflects the zero grade of the ablaut alternation). For derivatives see under *me-(r)ced-, *m—ced—el—, *ced—il—. The Zan stem (cf.action noun Megr. ckadua—, Laz me-ckad-u} regularly corresponds to the Georgian one.The Svan form (action noun li-skäd- ) shows a non-combinatorial length of the vowel and the regular transformation of the affricate into a spirant. Vogt (1939: 133) considered its vocalism a to be ancient. The meaning 'to shoe, forge' cannot be original. Similar Daghestanian forms (cf. Lezg. ccad, Tab. zad, Rutul $ad 'forge, smithy') are likely to have been borrowed from Georgian. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1895 XII: 112). For the rest of the material see Marr (1911-1914 I: 145).
GZ *£ed-il- 'wrought, forged': Georg, cedil- 'wrought, forged'; Megr. ckadir-\ Laz ckader-.
Noun formation attested with the same meaning in Old Georgian texts (Abulase 1973: 556).The word is a past participle in -il from the verb stem *ced— : cd— 'to hammer in, nail'. The Laz cognate is adapted to adjectives ending in -er. Cf. also *gacedil- 'hammered in, stuffed'.
CK *ier- : iir- 'to hold; to catch': Georg, cer- 'to hold; to catch'; Megr. [ckor-} 'to catch'(?); Svan [cfer-]. Verb stem documented in Old Georgian where it had also the meaning 'to attain, reach'. The Georgian action noun is cera—, which seems tocorrespond to Svan ckdra 'care, meditation' if the latter is not borrowed. In Zan languages the stem can be traced in the continuants of its apophonic derivative *cir- 'to need; to suffer misfortune'. Another Zan continuant of the stem may perhaps be Megr. ckor— 'slave' which reflects the parallel vocalism *a (cf.Schmidt 1962: 157). 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Schmidt (ibidem).
320



*cer- : cr
CK *der- : ir- 'to cut, chop, fell': Georg, cer- : cr- 'to cut, chop, fell'; Megr. ckir— : cksr-\ Laz cki(r}~ : ckor-\ Svan [r-].
Verb stem well attested in Old Georgian (mohcrides tavsa quvilisasa '(they) plucked the ears of corn' Lk. 6.1; action noun era-). In Georgian dialects one finds also the full grade a which is reflected in Laz (cf. action noun o-ckor-u alongside o-ckir-u). The Megrelian form (action noun ckinta-) also has the meaning 'to reap, mow'. For Svan the stem may be identified in its probable derivative la-r-e 'meadowland, meadow' showing the compensatory lengthening of the vowel. The well-known Svan verb stem ckor—, ckwr- with the same meaning must be treated as a Zan borrowing. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 28). Laz: Marr (1936: 64). Svan: &SKJa\ 255-256.
GZ *aeik- 'to cut (fine)': Georg, ceck- 'to cut (fine)'; Megr. ckack-. "
Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. It belongs to a series of descriptive stems of similar phonological structure: cf. *ceck-, *3d$g- *ceck-, and some others. Concerning the repetition of the velar element in Megrelian see the cited forms and many others. | | Zyenti (1940: 230).
GZ *£e£q- 'to crush; to squash, squeeze': Georg, cecq- 'to crumple, to press'; Megr. cqa(n)cq-, Laz [cancq-].
Verb stem apparently unattested in Old Georgian texts. For Georgian cf. the dialectal cencq- and cencex(d)- 'quagmire, mud'. The Zan forms regularly correspond to the Georgian one (cf. the Megrelian action noun mecqa(n)cqua- with an optional n). The Laz equivalent may be extracted from the derivative noun cancq-op- 'bog, swamp'. Arm. janjxel 'to crush, squash' may go back to a Zan source. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cikobava (1940: 95).
GZ *£il— 'nit': Georg, eil— 'nit'; Megr. ckir—; Laz mckir—. Unattested in Old Georgian. In its modern continuant there is a change c > c which occurs in forms designating small objects. Apart from the inorganic Laz word-initial m the Zan forms regularly reflect the proto
form. 1 1 Macavariani (1965: 42).

cir
CK *Cir- 'to need; to suffer a misfortune': Georg, cir- 'to need'; Megr. ckir-, ckor-; Laz ckar-, nckar-, cir- 'to need, to grieve'(?); Svan ckdr'to worry, upset'. Verb stem represented in Old Georgian sources (araj gcirs sen... 'neither carest thou...' Mt. 22.16). The stem must be viewed as a denominative apophonic formation based on *cir- 'need, misfortune; plague'. One of the Laz forms lacks of k since it is recorded in the Atina dialect where a change ck > c takes place. The parallel Megrelian form cir— is likely to be a Georgian loan. Cf. also the Svan action noun li-cksr— e.
\ j Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 410).
CK(?) *£ir- 'need, plague': Georg, cir- 'want, need; plague'; Svan
'
Possibly a noun correlative of the verb stem *cer- : cir- 'to hold; to catch'. At the same time it forms the basis of the secondary verb stem *cir— 'to need; to suffer a misfortune'. It is well known in Old Georgian (aryara moiqsenis ciri 'remembered no more anguish' Jn. 16.21). The Svan cognate may be extracted from cksra- 'anxiety, thought'.
CK(?) *ir- 'to squeak; to chirp': Georg, cr-ial- 'to squeak'; Megr. [ckir-} 'to chirp; to squeak'; Laz ckir-al- 'to squeak'; Svan cksr-man'to chirp'. Onomatopoeic verb stem usually occurring with word-forming affixes. In Megrelian the stem may be discerned in the derivative ckirckin- (see *crcin-). The Zan form is in regular agreement with the Georgian one. The element —man of the Svan stem needs explanation. Arm. cr— shows the same onomatopoeic stem. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Zyenti (1949: 140). Laz, Svan: USKJa: 256.
GZ *ir-il- 'cut, chopped': Georg, cril- 'cut, slit, break'; Megr. ckiril'cut'; Laz ckire(r)-. In Old Georgian it can be extracted from the derived formation mocril'cut off'. The word must be viewed as a past participle in -il from the verb stem *cer— : cr- 'to cut, chop, fell'. In Laz its structure is adapted to adjectives ending in -er. Georgian, Megrelian: Schuchardt (1902.1: 295).

*crcin
GZ *Crdin- 'to chirp, to squeak': Georg, cricin- 'to chirp'; Megr. ckirckin-, ckarckan- 'to chirp, to squeak'.
The verb stem is attested in Old Georgian: vitarca mercxali vereinend Ί chirped like a swallow' Krest. 287.9; action noun crcinva- (Sar^vela3e 1995: 273). In Georgian it underlies a derivative cricina- 'dragon-fly' which contains the suffix -a. Historically the stem may have been formed by reduplication. 1 1 USKJa: 256.
GZ *£ur— 'vessel': Georg, cur— 'vessel, thing'; Megr. cku$-, ckud- 'vessel, ship'. A technical term widely represented in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 559) where reduplication curcer- with the same meaning (cf. curceri okrojsaj 'golden vessel' Job 28.17) also occurs. The Zan form is in regular accord with the Georgian one. Arm. kcuc- and kcic- 'vessel' must go back to an old loanword from Zan (cf. Kapancjan 1975: 369). ||Marr(1909:3^).
GZ *£qantl- 'unripe': Georg, cqantl- 'unripe, flabby'; Megr. cqontor-o'youth, girl'. A deverbative formation apparently unattested in Old Georgian texts. In the modern language it is a dialectal (Raca) word (cf. yionti 1984: 732, 733). The lexeme forms a parallel to Georgian-Zan *cqintl-, approximately with the same meaning, and like the latter goes back to the verb stem *cql~et- : cql-it- : cql-t- 'to crumple, press' with an insertion of n. The Megrelian equivalent contains a suffixal element.
CK *£qi- 'to scream, yelp': Georg. cqi-(v)- 'to scream, yelp'; Megr. cqi—\ Laz cq(v)i—\ Svan cqi-.
Verb stem. Like other forms of the same structure *ki-, *qi-, *cxi-, *ci-, it has a descriptive nature. Cf. its action nouns Georg, cqivil-, Megr. cqiap-, Laz o-cqvi-u and Svan li-cqil-i.
| | Georgian, Megrelian: Sardschweladse (1985: 25).
GZ *iqintl- 'unripe (fruit, produce)': Georg, cqintl- 'unripe maize'; Megr. cqint(u)- 'unripe maize, unripe (young) cheese'; Laz cqint- 'unripe maize'. A deverbative formation correlated with the stem *cql-et- : cql-it- : cql-t- which is more evident from its Georgian variant cqlint-. The noun
323



*cql
contains an inorganic n and shows a metathesis of/. The Megr. cqintolua'to knead cheese' is likely to have a denominative origin (cf. Megr. gimolua- 'to salt' based on *^m(u}- 'salt'). The Svan cqint 'boy' must be viewed as a loanword from Zan since the extention -et: -t is unknown here. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 143-144).
GZ *iql- 'to crumple, squeeze': Georg, [cql-] 'to crumple, squeeze'; Megr. [cql-].
The simple verb stem is nowhere preserved in its unbound shape. It may be traced in the derivatives *cql-ep- : cql-ip- : cql-p- and *cql-et: cql-it- : cql-t-. Cf. also c(q)l-em-a- 'to press' attested in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 559). Arm. cxl-el with the same meaning derives from the Kartvelian stem.
GZ *£ql-ep- : iql-ip- : iql-p- 'to press, squeeze': Georg, cqvlep- : cqvlip- 'to press, crush'; Megr. cqip- 'to pack tight'; Laz cqip- 'to press, crush'; Svan cqp- (?). Verb stem formed from the base *cql- by adding a no longer productive extension *-ep : -p. In the Zan cognate the consonant cluster is reduced: cf. the Laz word-form do-cqip-u 'he crushed it' (action noun o-cqip-u). The same process shows West Georgian dialectal gacqepa— 'to swell from drinking' (cf. ylonti 1984: 146). The Megrelian equivalent (action noun cqipua-) underwent a semantic shift: cf. its additional meaning 'to swell from drinking'. The inherited character of Svan li-cqp-e 'to press, crush' remains somewhat problematic. jj'Klimov(1988: 163).
GZ *Cql-et- : öql-it- : öql-t- 'to crumple, squeeze': Georg, cqlet- : cqlit- 'to crumple'; Megr. cqilat- : cqilit- : cqirt-.
Verb stem derived from the base *cql- by means of the extension *-et: -t. The Georgian and Zan forms can be reduced to a single type of ablaut alternation. Megrelian possesses variants of the stem with secondary n: cf. cqilintua-, cqilontua-. A relatedness of the Laz o-lat-u 'to crumple' to this archetype remains in doubt. The inherited status of the Svan form cqat-an- 'to press' is very questionable. Arm. cxlt-el 'to crumple' has obviously a Kartvelian source. I I iSKJa: 256-257.
324



*cqun
CK *iqun- 'to press; to knead, crumple': Georg, cqun- 'to press; to knead, crumple'; Svan mcqsn-, mcqn- 'to press'. Verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language it is a dialectal (Gur.) item (yionti 1984: 734); action noun cqunva-. The Svan action noun li-mcqsn-e shows secondary augmentation by m. 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 37).
X
GZ *x- 'to touch': Georg, je- 'to touch'; Megr. jc-. Verb stem widely attested in Old Georgian sources: ara seaxit twirtsa mas 'touch not the burdens' Lk. 11.46; action noun sexeba-, daxeba- (cf. Abulaje 1973: 136, 499). In Megrelian the stem may be represented by the word-form g-o-x-u 'it concerns you'. | | Fähnrich (1982: 38).
GZ *xal-: xl- 'to be among, near (smth.)': Georg, xl- 'to be among, near (smth.)'; Megr. xol-; Laz xol-. Verb stem known from Old Georgian: cf. action noun xleba- (Abulage 1973: 563). The Zan cognate regularly corresponds to the Georgian one (Megrelian action noun xolapa-). The addition of preverbs to the stem imparts a meaning 'to approach' (cf. Old Georg, mieaxlnes mqevalni 'the handmaidens came near (to him)' Gen. 33.6). The Georg.-Zan *axlos 'near, close to' and Georg, axal- 'new' are related to the stem. Concerning its Georgian derivatives see Schmidt (1962: 94). One of them is Georgian-Zan *(s)a-xl- 'house'. | | USKJa: 260.
GZ *xar- : xr- 'to bend, bow, to be bowed': Georg, xar- : xr- 'to bend, bow, to be bowed'; Megr. [xir-]; Laz [xir-]. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (Abulaje 1973: 563). Both ablaut grades are reflected in Georgian: cf. action noun da-xr-a- alongside the word-form da-i-xar-a 'he bowed'. In Zan languages the stem can be extracted from its suffixal derivatives: cf. *xr-ek- : xr-k-. | | Klimov (1988: 163).
325



*xar- : xr
GZ *xar- : xr- 'to gnaw': Georg, xar- : xr- 'to gnaw'; Laz xor-, In Georgian the action noun of this verb is xra-: cf. the word form da-v-xar-i Ί have gnawed'. Contrary to the Georgian form its Laz correspondence reflects only the full grade: cf. xorums 'he gnaws'. 1 1 Kartozia (1979: 68^69).
GZ *xarg- 'heap, pile (of stones, wood)': Georg, xerg- 'heap, pile (of stones, wood)'; Megr. xorg- 'heap, pile of stones'; Lazxorg- 'pile'. Unattested in Old Georgian. The vocalic shape of the Zan form presupposes the former *a (the origin of the parallel Megrelian variant xurg—, which can also mean 'threshold', remains unexplained: possibly it is based on the well-known functional value of the Kartvelian alternation a —u: cf. *bard—). Its Georgian correspondence can be derived from the same protoform taking into account the influence of the ancient umlaut factor. The lexeme underlies the respective verb stems; cf. the action nouns Georg, xergva- and Megr. xorgua- 'to heap up with stones, wood'. Comparison with Iranian material proposed in Tedeevi (1988: 38-39) is difficult to accept. | | F hnrich (1982: 38). Cf. Klimov (1988: 163-164).
GZ(?) *xarx— 'saw': Georg, xerx— 'saw'; Megr. xorx-; Laz [xorx—]. A technical term. Some doubts arise because the implement itself correlates chronologically with the iron age. The word is attested in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 562). While the Megrelian form points to a former vocalism α its Georgian correspondence may be considered to have been umlauted. The Laz xe(r)x~ and Svan xerx- 'saw' are Georgian loanwords, although the Laz verb stem xorx- 'to saw' may go back to the historical designation of the saw. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 407).
GZ *xarxal- 'guffaw, loud laugh': Georg, xarxar- 'guffaw'; Megr. xorxos-. Unattested in Old Georgian. The reduplicated structure of the word shows its onomatopoeic nature. The Georgian (Gur.) variant xarxal(yionti 1984: 741) matches phonetically the Megrelian form. The correspondence Georg. / ~ Zan s points to the specific denominal character of the Megrelian action noun xorxosua-. 1 1 Klimov (1988: 21).
GZ(?) *xetk- : xtk- 'to tear, break; crack, burst': Georg, xetk- 'to tear', skd- 'to break, <bufst'; Laz stik—, stik—.
326



*xep— : xp
A tentative reconstruction. The verb stem is represented in Old Georgian where it has still preserved the ablaut alternation xetk- : stk- with the change χ > s in a consonant cluster: ara ganstkda badej igi 'was not the net broken' Jn. 21.11; cf. the action noun stkdoma- (Sar|vela3e 1995: 188). Already in Old Georgian stk yielded sk. The Georgian stems showing two ablaut grades are differentiated now for mood. According to Topuria (1991: 135) the historical root element is only tk. The Laz cognates (action noun o-stik-u) reflect the zero grade. Vogt (1939: 332) consider Arm. xet'k'el 'to strike' a borrowing from Georgian. 1 1 ESKJa: 260.
CK *xep- : xp- 'to break, to smash': Megr. [xap-] 'to break'; Laz
• '·
[xap—]; Svan xep— : xp—.
The possible Georgian link of this comparison (mo—sp—oba- 'to destroy, annihilate') raises doubts since the change χ >s in the cluster may be corroborated by the single example adduced in the preceding entry (cf., however, *pu-). For the Zan languages the stem may be identified in its derivatives: cf. Megr. na-xap-ul-e- and Laz no-xap-ul-e- 'splinter, chip'. The two historical ablaut grades are reflected only in Svan: action nouns li-xep (intransitive), li-xp-e (transitive). Arm. xpel 'to smash, bang' shows the same onomatopoeic stem. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 157). Svan: USKJa: 261.
CK *xw- 'to meet': Georg, [xv-] 'to meet'; Megr. [xv-]; Laz xv-; Svan xw(j)- 'to meet; to understand'. Traceable in Georgian and Megrelian in its derivatives: beside *xw-ed- : xw-d- with the same meaning cf. Megr. se-xv-alama- 'to meet' and me-xv-alama- 'to understand'. In Laz the stem occurs without enlargements: cf. kodo-mo-xvi] 'meet me!'. In Svan its continuant is widely used: action noun li-xwj-e alongside its causative counterpart li-xw-in—e.
| | Megrelian, Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 75). Laz: USKJa: 258.
GZ *xwad— 'male (of dog and other beasts of prey)': Georg, xvad- 'male (of dog, etc.)'; Megr. [xod-]; Laz [xod-]. Attested in Old Georgian in the form ofxuad- (Abulase 1973: 564). In the Zan languages its continuant may be extracted from the denominative verb stem: cf. action noun Megr. xodua-, Laz o-xod-u 'coire' which reflects the change να > ο.
327



*xwa(w)
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 405). Laz: Schmidt (1962: 158).
CK *xwa(w>- 'great number, multitude': Georg, xvav- 'pile, heap'; Megr. xva- 'flock'(?). Svan xwäj, xwäj 'many, much, multitude'. The word is represented in Old Georgian: xuavi ipklisaj 'heap of flour' (Abulase 1973: 564). Cf. also the East-Georgian dialectal form xov(yionti 1984: 758). The stem-final v of the Georgian cognate seems to be secondary. For the Svan reflex cf. *zlyva(w)-. The Megrelian word is possibly borrowed. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Dzanasvili (1902: 13). Svan: USKJa: 258.
CK *xw-ed- : xw-d- 'to meet; to be found': Georg, xved- : xvd- 'to meet, to be found'; Megr. xvad-; Laz xvad-; Svan xwld-. The verb stem is well known in Old Georgian (da sexudes magas... 'and ...(they) befall him...' Gen. 44.29; cf. action noun sexudoma-; mxueda 'it fell to my lot') where in the shape of xved- the regular correspondence of the Zan full grade (cf. Megr. v-xvad-i met') has been preserved. The stem is derived from the base *xw- by suffixation. In Svan compensatory lengthening is found: *xwj + -ed > xwid. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraya (1912: 40). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 424). Svan: Klimov (1960: 24).
GZ *xwe(w)- 'to embrace; to wind (round)': Georg, xvev- 'to embrace; to wind (round)'; Laz xval- 'to embrace; to kiss'. A verb stem well represented in Old Georgian texts: cf. ...da seuxwia cqluli igi '...and bound up his wound' Lk. 11.34; its action noun is (se)xueva— (Abulaje 1973: 291, 564). For the correspondence between Georg, v and Zan / in stem-final position see also *zaku(w)-, *pe(w)-, *te(w)-, *caw- : cw-. For the meaning of the Laz stem cf. French embrasser.
CK *xwet- : xwt- 'to scrape': Georg, xvet- 'to scrape; to tear off; to sweep'; Megr. xvat- 'to scratch; to gnaw, bite'; Laz xvat- 'to gnaw, bite'; Svan xwet- : xwt- 'to perish (of a multitude)'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian sources (rajta ... ixuetodes '(in order) to scrape' Job 2.8; action noun xueta-). The Zan forms regularly correspond to the Georgian one: action nouns are Megr. xvatua— and Laz o-xvat-u; the same applies to the formal side of the Svan form (action
328



*xwec- : xwc
nouns are li-xwet and li-xwt-e). It is more difficult to connect the stems semantically. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 425). Svan: Schmidt (1962: 158).
GZ *xwec- : xwc- 'to peel': Georg, xvec- 'to plane, to cut, to square'; Megr. xoc-; Laz xoc- 'to peel'. Verb stem attested in Old Georgian where, combined with different preverbs, it had a wide semantic range 'to peel, scrape, hew', etc. (cf. Abulage 1973: 18,49, 291). In the Zan cognate the historical sequence we is reflected as o: action nouns Megr. xocua- and Laz o—xoc-u (cf. also Laz xvec- <xvac- 'cutlass; chopper'). 1 1 USKJa: 259.
GZ *xwl-ep- : xwl-ip- 'to gulp (down); to choke': Georg, xvrep- : xvrip- 'to gulp (down); to choke'; Megr. xvip—; Laz xlap— : xlip—; Svan xw/i/7-(?). Verb stem with an expressive p unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language also a dialectal (Gur.) variant xvlep- : xvlip- is known. The Megrelian cognate is somewhat reduced (action noun xvipua-). The Georgian and Laz forms have preserved the ablaut alternation. The similar Svan stem may go back to a Zan source. 1 1 Svan, Zan: Zyenti (1940: 232). Georgian: £SKJa: 259.
GZ *xwr-en- : xwr-in- 'to snore': Georg, xvren- : xvrin- 'to snore'; Megr. xurxin—, xirxin—.
Verb stem attested in Old Georgian (egina da xurinavda '(he) slept and snored' Sin. mr. 105.19). Although its simple base is unknown, -en : —in in all probability is a word-forming affix occurring in other stems. The second χ of the Megrelian form seems to be due to an association of the stem with xurx— 'throat'. 1 1 Gudava (1954: 702).
CK *xiar- 'to be glad, rejoice': Georg, [xiar-] 'to be glad, rejoice'; Megr. xiol- 'gladness, joy'; Laz xel- 'to be glad, rejoice'; Svan xiad- : xid-. For Old Georgian the verb stem may be identified in derivative mxiarul- 'glad, joyful, gay' (cf. Abulage 1973: 313). In the Laz cognate (cf. action noun o-xel-u) the sequence io results in e. Dialectal Georgian (Imer.) xiod- (from a Zan source ?) 'cheerful mood of the patients suffering from a not so serious epidemic disease' seems to support a re
329



*xinc)k
construction of final d. The Svan cognate with Γshows compensatory lengthening. Cf. the action nouns li-xiad-e, li-xid-e alongside xiadul'gladness, joy'. 1 1 Marr (1911-1914 VIII. 1240). Cf. also ESKJa: 260.
GZ *xincik- 'pebble': Georg, xinck- 'seed or stone of grapes'; Megr. xinckv- 'sharp pebble'. Unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language the word is found in the Imerian dialect. Despite the semantic difference of the forms their comparison seems quite admissible. | | F hnrich (1984: 45).
GZ *xok- 'to scrape': Georg, xok- 'to scrape, to scratch'; Megr. xok- 'to shave, to scrape'. Unattested in Old Georgian it occurs in the language of Rustaveli (1006,2). In modern Georgian also its later dialectal variant xoc- is found. The Megrelian action noun is xokua- (cf. its derivative o-xok-al'razor'). The semantic difference between the cognates is insignificant. According to Deeters (cf. Schmidt 1962: 137) the Megrelian form may be related to the verb stem *pxek—. | | Klimov (1973: 36).
GZ *xolo Only': Georg, xolo Only, and (conjunction)'; Megr. xvale Only, alone'; Lazxvala Only. Widely in use in Old Georgian (xolo getqwi tkuen... 'and I say unto you...' Mt. 8.11; cf. also its derivative mxolo- 'the only'), where xole 'alone, only' is also known (Sar|vela3e 1995: 274). In the Zan forms a change ο > να has occurred (for a similar development see *qana-, *yolo-, etc.). Laz a in stem-final position must be secondary: cf. Megr. xvala-xe- One-handed, one-armed' where a change e > a inside the word follows the regular development. Marr saw in this word the root xl-. \ | Georgian, Megrelian: Janashili (cf. Erckert 1895: 294). All Kartvelian material is identified in Savaxisvili (1937: 386).
GZ *xotr- 'to clip, shear': Georg, xotr- 'to cut (close to the skin), clip, shear'; Megr. xotor—, xutor—, xucor-; Laz xotor-, xutor—, xocor—.
Unattested in Old Georgian. Judging from the varying reflexes, the stem may require two parallel protoforms *xotr— II xoc\r—. The similar Svan xinc r- 'to cut' is most likely a loanword from Zan languages. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 433^34).
330



*xr-ak
GZ *xr-ak- 'to char, to become charred; to bend, warp (in flames)': Georg, xrak- 'to become charred; to overroast'; Megr. xirok-. Attested in medieval Georgian literature. The verb stem is derived from the base *xar— : xr— with the help of the extension *—ek : —k. The Zan form (Megrelian action noun xirokua—} corresponds precisely to the Georgian one. Cf. below a parallel stem *xr-ek- : xr-ik- with the same meaning. Connection with Arm. xarakel 'to glaze' (cf. Acafyan 1973: 339) is difficult to accept. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Cikobava (1938: 432).
GZ *xr—ek- : xr—ik— 'to char, to become charred; to warp (in flames)': Georg, xrek- : xrik- 'to char; to fry, roast'; Megr. xirak- : xirik- 'to warp (in flames)'; Laz xrak- 'to roast, fry'. A parallel to the preceding verb stem. The Zan forms (cf. action nouns Megr. xirakua—, Laz o-xrak-u) regularly correspond to the Georgian one (action noun xreka—). As to be expected the Megrelian form xirikua— is transitive vs. intransitive xirakua-. One assumes that Georg, xrik- 'trick, dodge' is an apophonic nominal derivative of the stem. 1 1 OSKJa: 261-262.
GZ *xrek-il- 'warped': Georg, xrekil- 'warped'; Megr. xirakil-. Unattested in Old Georgian. The form must be viewed as a past participle in *—il based on the verb stem *xr-ek- : xr-k—. The meaning of the word depends to a certain degree on its interaction with the lexeme *y(w)rek-il-.
GZ *xrup- 'to drink (with avidity)': Georg, xrup- 'to drink (with
•·
avidity)'; Megr. xup—. Apparently unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language found in dialects. Megrelian shows a simplified form. The stem can possibly be brought together with Georgian xvrep- 'to gulp (down), swallow; to choke' (see also *xwlep- : xwlip—) as a lexicalized form of its zero grade.
GZ *xrut-un- 'snore': Georg, xrutun- 'to snore'; Laz x(r)utin-, xurtin-. Unattested in Old Georgian. The stem contains an affixal element and seems to be connected by the rules of Kartvelian sound-symbolism with *yru(n)t~. In Laz also a variant xrut-on- is found. The similar Svan xsrten- with the same meaning is a borrowing from Georgian.
\\Cf.£SKJa:262.

*x-u—dar-e
CK *x-u-dar-e 'worse (than it)': Georg, udare-s- 'the worst'; Svan xodra 'bad'.
The form is represented in Old Georgian sources (cf. Abulage 1973: 419). Similar to *x-u-cl-e 'more, larger, older' it must be considered a lexicalized form of a former predicative structure where x- is a formal prefix of the indirect object of the third person, u- a prefix of the object version and dar- II dr- a verb stem (see *dar- : dr-). | | Cf. Klimov (1973:367).
CK *xut- 'five': Georg, xut- 'five'; Megr. xut-; Lazxu(t)-; Svan woxusd, woxwisd, woxwist.
The numeral is well attested in Old Georgian (uyleuli xarta viqide xuti have bought five yoke of oxen' Lk. 14.19), where it had many derivatives (Abulase 1973: 564). The word furnishes an example of the correspondence between Georgian-Zan t and Svan sd. The initial seqence wo in Svan is explained by assimilation to wosdxw- 'four' (cf.Topuria 1979: 202). Here also a development u > wi has taken place. | | Rosen (1845: 11).
GZ *xun- 'to fade; to lose color; to wither': Georg, xun- 'to fade'; Megr. (r)xin- 'to lose color, fade; to wither'; Laz xin- 'to fade'. A verb stem unattested in Old Georgian. Its Zan reflexes (cf. action nouns Megr. go(r)xin-apa-, Laz o-xin-u) are characterized by / vocalism. The Megrelian cognate may contain a secondary r. Dialectal Arm. xunanal //xonanal 'to fade' seems to be a Kartvelian loanword (cf., however, Kapancjan 1975: 355). | | Georgian, Laz:Fähnrich (1975: 343).
GZ *xut- 'to press oneself (to, against)': Georg, xut- 'to press (to, against)'; Megr. xut-ol-. Apparently unattested in Old Georgian. S. Orbeliani adduces its action noun xut-il-. The Megrelian cognate (action noun xutolapa-) contains an additional stem-forming element (cf. *be^y-, *rek-, *yr^-, etc.). In Laz no certain equivalent is found. The connection of the stem with Arm. xttel with the same meaning (cf.Acafyan (1973: 428) needs more study. | | Kipsidze (1914: 409).
GZ *x-u-Cj-esj- Older, larger'; Georg, xuces- 'elder, old man'; Megr. u(n)cas- 'elder'; Laz uncas-.
332



*qal- : ql
The lexeme is amply attested in Old Georgian sources (movides ... xucesni 'there come ... the chief priests' Mk. 11.27). It is derived by substantivization of the word-form of the comparative degree where x—is prefix of the third person, u- a prefix of the objective version, and c a historical root element. In Laz the word is used rather rarely. In the Zan languages its antonyms are known: cf. Megr. ukulas- and Laz umkilas-, unkilas- 'youngest, junior'.
CK *qal- : ql- 'to drive in; to push': Georg, xal- : xl- 'to beat; to push'; Svan qal- : ql- 'to drive in; to fill with'. A verb stem attested in Old Georgian: seaqala tavi twisi... '(he) drive in his head...' (cf. Penrixi-Sar^velase 1990:492),where the original q was still preserved. 1 1 Fähnrich (1985: 28).
CK *qaml- 'skin (of legs) of sheep, goat': Georg, xaml- 'sort of soft shoes (foot wear)'; Megr. xvemur- 'through hole' (?); Svan qamr, qemsr 'skin (of legs) of sheep, goat, calf. The word is widely represented in Old Georgian (seasxa mat qamlebi '(he) put them shoes' Lev. 8.7;uqamur- 'barefooted'). The inclusion here of the Megrelian form remains questionable in view of its deviation in meaning. The correspondence Georg. / ~ Svan r in word-final position needs also more study. As for the meaning of the Georgian cognate it is worth mentioning that in Svanetia sheep skin was till recently used for making sandals. | | Georgian, Svan: Kaldani (IKE VII, 1955:183). Cf.ESKJa: 263.
CK *qan- : qn- 'to plough, till': Georg, xun- : xn- 'to plough, till'; Megr. xon-, Laz xon-; Svan qan- : qn-.
The verb stem is widely known in Old Georgian (monaj, qnvides anu mcqsides... 'servant, plowing or feeding...' Lk. 17.7; action noun qnva-, cf. also mqnvel- 'ploughman'). According to some authors (cf.Cikobava 1938: 430)the form is a denominative one (cf.Svan qän 'bull, ox'). The Georgian and Svan (action noun li-qn-i) cognates preserve the ablaut alternation. The Zan vocalism reflects only the full grade (cf.action noun Megr. xonua-). In Laz the use of the stem is restricted.

*qar
I I Georgian, Svan: Dzanasvili (SMOMPK 31; IV: 22). Megrelian: Caraia (1918: 465). Laz: Cikobava (1938:430).
GZ *qar- 'bull, ox': Georg, xar- 'bull, ox'; Megr. xo$-; Laz xo$~. The word is well attested in Old Georgian texts (dakla qari ... mamaman senman 'thy father hath killed the fatted calf Lk. 15.27). The Zan form is in regular agreement with the Georgian one. In relation of the verb *qan— : qn—the substantive is of a derivative nature which cannot be said about Svan qän-, qan- 'bull, ox'. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 72).Laz:Schuchardt (1902.1: 292).
CK *qarqa- 'pharynx, mouth': Georg, xaxa- 'pharynx, throat'; Megr. [xorxa-]; Svan qarq, qerq.
Apparently unattested in Old Georgian texts, but preserved in S. Orbeliani's dictionary in its Old Georgian form qaqa—. In the Zan languages it may be extracted from its derivative represented in the Megr. xorxota'throat'. The priority of r in the word is corroborated also by dialectal Georgian xarxa- (yionti 1984: 741). The Svan cognates illustrate the old non-functional alternation of a and e. | | USKJa: 264.
GZ *qas- : qs- 'to close (up), to connect': Georg. xs-, sx- 'to close, to lock'; Megr. (r)sx-, (r)cx- 'to close, lock, to form'; Laz (m)cjc- 'to connect, to link, to join'. In Georgian the verb is characteristic of the ancient texts where the later parallel stem qas— : qs—also occurs (daeqsnes cani... 'the heaven was shut up...' Lk. 4.25;action noun qsva—). The Zan forms underwent consonantal metathesis and a change s > c in position before x. For the stem-initial positon the augmentation of a sonorant is characteristic here (cf. Laz action noun o-mcx-u). The stem underlies a derivative *(s)a—qs-ar—.
\ | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 59).Cf. Kartozia (1979: 71-73).
CK *qe- 'hand, arm'; Georg, xel- 'arm'; Megr. xe- (pi. xel-); Laz xe-; Svan qa-l 'length of two outstretched arms'. The word is well known from Old Georgian (qeli qelisa oil... 'hand for hand...' Ex. 21.24; a number of derivatives are formed from it). The identity in vocalism of the Georgian and Zan forms points to the historical
334



*qed- : qid- : qd
word-final position of the vowel and the secondary nature of /. On the basis of this identity Marr considered the Zan form a borrowing from Georgian; cf. Caraya (1912: 34). Their Svan equivalent (pi. qal—ar) shows a later suffixal element. 1 1 Rosen (1845: 30).Cf. USKJa: 264.
CK *qed- : qid- : qd- 'to move, make movement; to bring; to go,': Georg, xad- : xd- 'to take, take out; to happen, occure'; Megr. rt- 'to go'; Laz xt-, xt-; Svan qad-(qed-, qid-): qd- 'to come; to bring; to take out, draw out'. A verb stem of wide semantic range conveying the broad idea of motion. It is well known from Old Georgian (iqada maxwili '(he) drew ... sword' Mt. 26.51; staqda cqarosa '(she) went down unto the well'Gen. 24.45), where it still retained the old q (action noun qdoma-). In Georgian a semantic separation of different ablaut grades took place. The Zan forms have preserved only the zero grade (cf. the Laz action noun o-xt-im-u and Megr. mida-rt-u 'he went'). The Svan action nouns are li-qed 'to come' and li-qd—e 'to bring'. Different from the other languages, Svan retains the pharyngeal. 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 426-427). Svan: Topuria (1979: 75).
GZ(?) *qew- 'ravine': Georg, xev- 'ravine'; Megr. xabo-. A problematic comparison. The forms qev- and mqev- are documented in Old Georgian sources: qoveli qevnebi aymoivsos... 'every valley shall be filled...' Lk. 3.5.(cf. Abulase 1973: 566; Sar^velase 1995: 160). For the correlation between Georg, v and Zan b cf. *kraw- and *tqaw-. However, the nature of ο at the end of the Megrelian lexeme remains obscure, as does the originality of the Svan qew 'ravine'. Georgian (Imer.) xabo- 'river bank' is considered to be a Zan loanword. | | F hnrich (1982: 38 and 1987:38).
GZ *qem- : qm- 'to dry,wither': Georg, xm- 'to dry, wither'; Megr. xwn-, xom-; Laz xom(b)—.
Well attested in Old Georgian (ganqma leywi... 'the fig tree withered away...' Mt. 21.19; action noun qmoba-), where the old ablaut alternation is still preserved. The Zan vocalism ο ( > u) reflects a parallel stem with vowel *a. Cf. action nouns Megr. xomapa-, xumapa-, Laz o-xom(b)-in-u. A secondary development of b is possible in the Laz equivalent.

^v
*qec
1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Kipsidze (1914: 406). Laz: Schuchardt (1902.2: 402).
GZ *qei- 'to fell, hew': Georg, xec- 'to fell, hew'; Megr. xack- 'to hoe, weed'; Laz xack- 'to fell, weed'. Apparently unattested in Old Georgian. In the modern language the stem is known in the shape of xec- (action noun daxeca-) and metathesized cex-. The East Georgian dialects, where an action noun daqecva- is found (ylonti 1984: 770), show its earlier form. The Zan form (action nouns Megr. xackua- and Laz o-xack-u) regularly corresponds to the Georgian stem. The Zan cognate frequently means also 'to weed'. 1 1 Megrelian, Laz: Cikobava (1938: 420). Georgian: USKJa: 264.
CK *qeci- : q«^- 'to tear to pieces; to torture': Georg, [xec-] 'to tear to pieces, to pull about, to torture'; Megr. xic- 'to fight; to wear out'; Svan qec- : qc- 'to wear out'. In Georgian the stem may be extracted from the deverbative noun m-xec- 'wild animal' < Old Georg, mqec- (Abula3e 1973: 315). The Megrelian form continues the zero grade (action noun xicua-). Both ablaut grades are preserved only in Svan: cf. action noun li-qec (intransitive), li-qc-e- (transitive). Other connections for the Georgian stem suggested by Schmidt (1962: 160) and Penrixi-Sar^velase (1990: 496). | | Megrelian, Svan: cf. Topuria (1979: 45).
GZ *qweza- 'flat cake, lozenge': Georg, xveza- 'fiat cake; lozenge'; Megr. xozo—, The lexeme is widely known in Old Georgian in the form queza—: ara gaqsos xuti igi quezaj... 'neither remember the five loaves...' Mt. 16.9. The change a > at the end of the Megrelian word is caused by its frequent use as an attribute (cf. a similar development in *katxa- and *kope-). Cf. also the Megrelian compound xozo-kvar- 'a kind of the ritual flat cake' (see * fewer-). 1 1 Marr (cf. Caraya'l912: 15).
CK *qwel- 'cough, cold (in the head), running nose': Georg, xvel'cough'; Megr. xval-\ Laz xval- 'cold (in the head), phlegm'; Svan qwes, qwäs 'cough'.
336



*qwel
Cf. the parallel verb stem *qwel-. It illustrates the correspondence between Georg.-Zan / // r and Svan s in stem-final position of a noun (cf. *asul-, *til-, *c,o/-, *CiM/-). The correlation of the vowels is regular. According to Cikobava (1938: 424) qw constitutes the old root. An onomatopoeic nature of the lexeme is not ruled out. || Georgian, Megrelian: Brosset (1849: 75). Svan: Wardrop (1911: 600).
GZ *qwel- 'to cough': Georg, xvel- 'to cough'; Megr. xval-; Laz xval-. Verb stem registered in Old Georgian texts in the form quel- (Abulaje 1973: 571). It seems to be of a denominative nature (see *qwel-), which is apparently corroborated by the free Svan form li-qs-un-e 'to cough' showing a denominative word-formation pattern (cf. the preceding entry). The cognates are in regular agreement with each other. Cf. action nouns Georg, xvela—, Megr. xvalua-, Laz o-xval-u. 1 1 Cikobava (1938: 424.
GZ *qwemil- : qwmil- 'to guard; to watch for; to meet': Georg, qumil'to guard; to watch for'; Megr. xvamil- 'to meet'. Known in Georgian only from ancient texts (dgebodes da qwnilvides... '(they) stood keeping watch over...' Lk. 2.8), where it had a number of derivatives (cf. mqumil- 'guard, custodian', saqumilav- 'guard, watch; lodge'). The cited material properly reflect the old ablaut alternation. Semantically they differ insignificantly. | | USKJa: 268.
CK *qwer- : qwr- 'to make holes, pierce; to gnaw through': Georg. [xvr-] 'to make holes, pierce; to gnaw through'; Megr. rx(v)-\ Laz x(v)-; Svan qwir- : qwr-.
In Old Georgian the verb stem may be extracted from its derivatives: see *qwr—el— and *qwr-et- : qwr—it-. The ancient q is regularly preserved in its Svan equivalent. In Zan forms a consonant metathesis has taken place alongside the loss of r in Laz (cf. action noun Megr. rxuala-, Laz o—x—u). v is absent here in the position before u. Megr. muxv— 'mole' may be tentatively assigned to this root. The Svan action noun li-qwir-i makes it possible to reconstruct the full grade of the ablaut alternation. Cf. also Svan la-qwr-α 'window (without glass)'. | | Georgian, Megrelian: Marr (cf. Caraya 1912: 44). Laz, Svan: Klimov (1960: 25). See also USKJa: 265.
337



*qwi
GZ *qwi- 'to neigh (of a horse)': Georg. qwi(v)- 'to neigh (of a horse)'; Megr. [jcv/-]; Laz [xi]. Simple onomatopoeic base fixed in the form qwiv-il- in Old Georgian (cf. Sar^velase 1995: 277). For modern Georgian cf. a dialectal (Tus) qvivil- (ylonti: 770). Its derivative *qwiqwin— with the same meaning has a reduplicative structure. See the following entry.
GZ *qwiqwin- 'to neigh (of a horse)': Georg, xvixvin- 'to neigh'; Megr. xvixvin-, Laz xi(r)xin- 'to neigh; to guffaw'. Verb stem of an onomatopoeic character (cf. its transparent reduplicative structure). Its underlying simple base is *q\vi-. Contrary to Megrelian form the Laz cognate (action noun o-xi(r)xin-u) does not give strict phonological correspondences. The shift in meaning 'to neigh' > 'to guffaw' needs no commentary. Svan li-xwixwin-i is a later borrowing. Remote onomatopoeic parallels to the stem can be found in some other languages of the Caucasus (cf. Arm. xrxngal, Avar hihidize, Darg. hihibikes, etc.).
| | Georgian, Laz: Cikobava (1939: 428). Megrelian: USKJa: 259.
GZ *qwr-el- 'slit, hole': Georg, xvrel- 'slit, hole'; Megr. [xuru-]. A derivative with the affix *-el from the stem *qwer- : qwr-. It is well attested in Old Georgian texts (melta qureli ucs 'the foxes have holes' Mt. 8.20). In Megrelian the word is traceable in the toponym Tuntis xuru etymologically 'Bear ravine' (see Fähnrich 1984: 45). Cf. also the evident Svan loanword from Old Megrelian *quru- 'grotto, slit'. | | Georgian, Megrelian (allegedly Svan): Wardrop (1911: 25).
GZ *qwr-et- : qwr-it- 'to make holes, pierce': Georg, xvret- : xvrit- 'to pierce, make holes'; Megr. xvirat- : xvirit-. Verb stem represented in Old Georgian (ganiquritos ... quri '(he) shall bore his ear through' Ex. 21.6). It is a derivative from the simple base *qwer- : qwr- with an extension *-et : -it. The Megrelian forms (cf. action nouns xviratua- and xviritua- opposed mutually by intransitivity ~ transitivity) are in regular agreement with the Georgian one. Cf. also deverbative Megr. xvirate- 'hole'. 1 1 Topuria (IKE I, 1946:78).
GZ *qid- 'passage, path': Georg, xid- 'bridge'; Megr. xin$-\ Laz The form qid- with the meaning 'bridge' is registered in Old Georgian (Abula3e 1973: 569). The word can be viewed as a apophonic nominal
338



*qlec- : qlic- : qlc
derivative from the verb stem *qed- : qd-. For the change *d > 3 in the Zan languages cf. *tred-, *yaryad-, *qund-. The original meaning of the word seems to have been narrowed in all languages. Evidence for its Kartvelian origin see in G. Schmidt (1928: 27-31) and Macavariani (1965: 21, 114). In Abaev (1989: 199) and Andronikasvili (1966: 129) a less probable Iranian etymology is adduced (cf. Osset. xid //xed 'bridge' from Old Iran. *haitu- 'bridge'). 1 1 Georgian, Laz: Rosen (1845: 33). Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 54).
GZ *qle£— : qlii— : qli- 'to tear off, be torn off': Georg, xlec— : xlic— 'to tear off, be torn off'; Megr. xarck- II xorck- : xirck- 'to tear off, burst'; Laz x(r)ock-, xrock-, xrosk-, xreck- 'to burst; to die (of animals)'. The verb stem attested in the modern shape in the language of Rustaveli (282.2). Cf. at the same time modern Georg. (Moxev.) na—qlec'scrape, fragment' (Kavtarase 1985: 294) and (Xevs.) na-qec- 'fragment of tree' (ylonti 1984: 419). It shows here the old ablaut alternation, which is also reflected in the Zan languages (action noun Megr. goxorckua-, Laz o-xrock—u). For the correspondence Georg, c ~ Zan ck in the position after r cf. *arcw-, *purcin-.
\ | Georgian, Zan: Macavariani. Cf. Gamqrelije (1959: 76).
GZ *qma- 'voice, sound': Georg, xma- 'voice, sound'; Megr. xuma-, X3ma—, xoma-.
Well known from Old Georgian (qma-vqav qmita didita Ί cried with a loud voice' Gen. 39.14), where it had a number of derivatives. The phonetic correspondences between the Georgian and Megrelian cognates are regular. Their Laz equivalent seems to be replaced by a Turkish borrowing. ||Caraia(1895XII: 106).
GZ *qm-el- 'dry, dry land': Georg, xmel- 'dry'; Megr. xumla-, xomula-, xomila—', Laz xom(b)ula—.
The lexeme is represented in Old Georgian in the shape of ^/we/where it had also the meaning 'land, ground, earth' (qmelsa zeda 'upon the earth' Lev. 11.29). It is a derivative from the verb stem *qem- : qm-. The history of the ending of the word in Zan languages needs more clarity. A secondary b occurs in the Laz form. 1 1 Brosset (1844: 16 and 1849: 76).
GZ *qorc- 'flesh, meat': Georg, xorc- 'flesh, meat'; Megr. xorc-, Laz xorc-, xo(r)c-.
339



*qorq
Widely used in Old Georgian texts (sobili qorctagan qorc ars 'which is born of the flesh is flesh' Jn. 3.6; hence follows its derivative qorciel'bodily, corporal'). With the exception of one of the Laz variants the phonetic shape of the word is regular in all languages. If its meaning 'meat' is considered a Georgian-Zan innovation (cf. *layw-), then originally it must have meant only 'flesh'. 1 1 Rosen (1845: 29).
GZ *qorq- 'throat, pharynx; jaws': Georg, xorx- 'throat, pharynx; jaws'; Megr. xurx-; Laz xu(r)x- 'throat'.
In Old Georgian the word was used in the form qorq- (Abula3e 1973: 570). Cf. also Xevs. and Tus. qorq- 'small gorge, canyon, manhole' (yionti 1984: 771).A shift o > u has taken place in Zan forms. Cf. also Laz xoxon$a— 'throat'. In Laz r often disappears. The lexeme may be of a descriptive character. Cf. in this connection *qarqa—. 1 1 ASKJa: 261.
GZ *qoc- 'to sweep; to wipe': Georg, xoc- 'to wipe up, rub;to sweep'; Laz xos— 'to peel (fruit)'. Verb stem well known from Old Georgian texts (tmita ... carhqocda '(she) wiped ... with (her) hair' Jn. 12.3) with a series of meanings depending on the preverb: carqoca- 'to clean', moqoca- 'to wipe up, to root out', daqoca- 'to destroy'. The Laz action noun is o-xos-u. According to Penrixi-Sar|vela3e (1990: 499) a change c > s at the end of the Laz form is due to its contamination with the verb o-kos-u 'to clean, sweep'. Despite Acaryan (1973: 413) the stem has nothing to do with Arm. xoc' 'wound'. 1 1 Fähnrich (1987: 38). A different comparison of the Georgian form see in Cikobava (1938: 340).
GZ *qoq- 'to crawl, creep': Georg, xox- 'to crawl, creep'; Megr. xox-; Laz xox-.
Verb stem represented in Old Georgian by the form qoq- surviving now only in the Tus. dialect. It is reflected in the Kartvelian languages in an identical form (cf. Megrelian action noun xoxua-; xoxi—xoxit 'crawling, on all fours'; Laz action noun o—xox—u; xoxe(r)i—xoxe(r)i 'crawling'). A rare Svan xox- is not native since Svan preserves old q. A descriptive nature of the stern is likely. | | USKJa: 261.Cf.Fähnrich (1975:343).
340



*qoqob
CK *qoqob- 'pheasant': Georg, xoxob- 'pheasant'; Megr. xoxob-; Svan qoqweb-.
In the form of qoqob- the word is found in Old Georgian (Abulase 1973: 570). Cf. also the dialectal (Ing.) and Bats (< East Georgian) loanword form qoqob. In Svan a change o > ö > we takes place. According to Topuria (cf. 1979: 266) the Svan lexeme derives from Georgian. The word is possibly of a sound-symbolic character (cf. Old Ind. kukkubha'pheasant'). The ancient Greek sources mention the abundance of pheasants in Colchis. 1 1 Georgian, Svan: Zyenti (1949: 136).
GZ *qrc1-wn- 'to corrode, be corroded; to crack, be cracked': Georg. xrcn- 'to decompose, decay; to rot'; Megr. xicon- 'to corrode, be corroded; to crack, be cracked'. Verb stem attested in the Old Georgian action noun qrcna-, xrcna(Abula3e 1973: 563, 571). It is characterized by a word-forming element *-wn. The parallel Megrelian form xicor- (< *xircon-) possibly reflects a trace of the former stem sonant r.
GZ *qsen- 'beestings': Georg, xsen- 'beestings'; Laz (n)cxon-, (m)xcon-.
Alongside usual for standard Georgian xsen— and metathesized Raca and Lecx. sxen- (cf. yionti 1984: 503) Moxev. and Mtiul. dialects preserve more archaic form qsen-. The Laz cognate reflects an old vocalism a, which makes it possible to reconstruct a protoform as *qsanand to assign the umlaut effect to the pre-Georgian stage. In Tedeevi (1988: 39) an Ossetic etymology is proposed. | | Kartozia (1979: 75).
GZ *qsi- a simple verb stem with the general meaning 'to remind, to remember'. See its derivative formations *qs}-en- and *qs}-ow-.
GZ *qsi-en- 'to remind; to inform, communicate': Georg, xsen- 'to remind, recollect; to inform'; Megr. sin-; Laz sin-. Verbal formation represented in Old Georgian sources where wordinitial q is still preserved; moiqsena ymertman 'God remembered' Gen. 30.22; action noun qseneba- (Abula3e 1973: 571). The Georgian and Zan forms continue the old affix *-en. The Zan forms (action noun Megr. sinapa-; cf. Laz siner- 'mentioned') lost the reflex of initial q in the cluster.
341



*qs,-o(w)
I I Georgian, Megrelian: Cagareli (1880: 61). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 364).
GZ *qs,-o(w>- 'to remember': Georg, xsov- 'to remember'; Megr. su-, sä-; Laz su—.
Verbal formation well known from Old Georgian (area gaqsos... '(ye) neither remember...' Mt. 16.9; action noun qsovna-). Zan forms (cf. Megr. su(n) 'he remembers') have lost the stem-initial consonant. The Svan Zanism rson—, rswn— 'to remember' points to the old shape of Megrelian stem. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 175).
GZ *qund- 'stocks; trap': Georg, xund- 'stocks, fetters (wooden); trap'; Megr. Kims-. In the form qund- the word is attested in Old Georgian texts, where a derivative action noun daqundeba— 'to chain, to fetter' is also known (Abulase 1973: 137, 572). The Megrelian equivalent coincides in the meaning. The correspondence Georg, d ~ Zan 3 at the end of the nominal stem recurs in *tmd-, *yeryed-, *qid-.
I 1 Rogava (1986: 32). Also Smidt (1989: 84).
3
GZ *§- 'to exceed, overcome': Georg, [j-] 'to exceed, overcome'; Megr.
In its unbound form the stem is nowhere attested. Already in Old Georgian it is extended by the enlargement -ob (um^obes ars senda... 'it is better for thee...' Mt. 5.10; action noun ^obna-). In the Zan languages it contains a causative(?) marker -in. Cf. the action nouns Megr. r$gina-, Laz o-r$gin-u. Megr. $gir- 'good', u$gun // Laz uggin 'better' are derived directly from the simple base. The Zan form often has an optional stem-initial r. \ | Georgian, Megrelian: Caraia (1918: IX: 751). Laz: Cikobava (1938: 436).
GZ *3e£g- 'to strike softly; to trample': Georg. $e$g- 'to strike softly'; Megr. ggagg- 'to strike softly; to masticate'; Laz 5a$g(v)-.
342



To be connected with the stems *ceck—, *ceck—, *ceck-,
*ceck-. Action nouns Georg, geggya-, Megr. ggaggua-, Laz o-^ga^g-u. Phonetic correspondences are sustained regularly (cf. the vocalic shape of the cognates and the development of g in the Megrelian equivalent). In Laz an extra v occurs: cf. $a^gve(r)- 'beaten'. Georg.-Zan *3i$g-wn- 'to tear; nip, pinch (roughly)' is derived from the stem. 1 1 Georgian, Megrelian: Fähnrich (1982: 38). Laz: Sardschweladse (1987: 24).
CK *|w- 'to defecate': Georg. $v- 'to defecate'; Megr. (n)$gv-, 5g(v)-; Laz 3g(v)-, zg(v)-, nzg(v)-; Svan sg-.
The verb stem varies according to Gamkrelidze's law. The Zan forms may lose stem-final v in the position before u, sometimes they show a secondary initial n. In the presentic tenses the stem is replaced by the word-forms of its derivative *gw-am- : gw-m-. The Svan cognate may be extracted from la-sg-ar 'lavatory, toilet'. Cf. xa-sg-en-i 'he wants to defecate'. | | Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 338). Svan: Gamqrelise (1959: 27).
GZ *$w-am- : ^w-m- 'to defecate': Georg, jvam- : §m- 'to defecate'; Megr. (n)jgww-; Laz jgum-. Derived by the extension *-am : -m from the simple verb stem *$w-. Action nouns are Georg. $ma—, Megr. (n)^guma-, Laz o—$gum-u. The stem is used in word-forms of the presentic tense series. 1 1 USKJa: 268-269.
GZ *|war- 'stake, picket': Georg. $var- 'cross'; Megr. 3gun($g)- 'stake; prickle, spike'; Laz m^gu^-, tnzgug- 'stake, post'. Widely attested in Old Georgian sources (guarsa zeda... On the cross...' Sin. mr. 92.21). The expected Zan form *3gu$- is closely similar to the Laz lexeme (in the Atina dialect a development j > z is known), from which it is easy to derive its Megrelian equivalent. The differences in material are not great enough to doubt the equation. For the semantic shift cf. Arm. xac' 'cross' < PIE *khet- 'stake, picket' (Acaiyan 1973: 334). ESKJa: 269.
GZ *|il- 'to patch up, sew (roughly)': Georg. $il- 'to sew (roughly)'; Megr. jgvzV- 'to patch up; to poke a big needle'. In Old Georgian the verb stem seems to be unattested. Action nouns are Georg, ji'/va-, Megr. ggvilua-. The probably late development of v
343



may explain the Megrelian seqence $g instead of expected $g if it were old. Lomtati3e (IKE XXV, 1986: 125) adduces another Megrelian counterpart with the same meaning, nggilua-, ||Rogava(1951:636).
GZ *|in ar- 'nettle': Georg, cincar- 'nettle'; Laz di(n)cki^-. The word is attested in Old Georgian, where it still preserved wordinitial | {a ymomicendebis ^incari.. . 'nettle shall spring up. ..' Job 31 .40). In present-day Georgian the latter has been assimilated to the second affricate, while in Laz it underwent change to d (cf. *$incwel— and some archetypes with word-initial 3). The alleged prefixal origin of $i > di (cf. Cikobava 1942: 174) can hardly be proved. One has also claimed a reduplication of the stem *cr- (car-) 'to cut, hew' in the word (cf. Vogt 1954: 544). | | Marr (191 1-1 914 IV:833).
GZ *§iniwel- 'ant': Georg, ciancvela- 'ant'; Megr. ckickitia-, $gi3gitia-\ Laz dimcku-, dumcku-, Svan ms(r)sk- (?).
In Old Georgian the term is represented by a form very close to the protoform (hba^evd $incvelsa... '(he) imitates an ant...' Krest. 177.20). In modern Georgian the lexeme is blended with cia- 'worm'. Cf., however, the dialectal variants gincvel-, buncvel-, etc. (yionti 1984: 92, 780). Its end shows the well known correspondence Georg, -el ~ Zan -u. Some irregular changes occurred also in the Megrelian cognate extended by an evaluative affix. It is much more difficult to derive from the protoform the Svan word which may have an Ossetic source (cf. Abaev 1949: 297). 1 1 Georgian, Zan: Cikobava (1938: 114).
GZ *$i$g-wn- 'to tear; nip, pinch (roughly)': Georg. $i^gn- 'to tear, pinch (roughly)'; Megr. $gi$gon- , 3g3$gon-. Unattested in Old Georgian. A verbal formation to be viewed as a derivative with the affix *-wn from the simple verb stem *$e$g- 'to strike softly' (action noun Georg. J/jgna-, Megr. ^gi^gonua-). It has an evident sound-symbolic character: cf. its parallel *cick—wn-, *cick—wn—, *cick—wn—, *3i$g—wn-.

GZ *|i|y- 'black thrush': Georg. 313γ- 'black thrush'; Megr.

*3Y(w)l-em- :
In Old Georgian the word does not occur. According to a well-known rule, in Megrelian forms a secondary velar element is also represented in the first syllable. The parallel vocalism requires an explanation. | | Fähnrich (1985: 29).
GZ *^y(w)l—em— : |y(w)l—im- 'to crumple': Georg, zyvlem- : zyvlim'to crumple'; Megr. rgyim- 'to stir'; Laz (n)^yim- 'to crumple'. The verb stem occurs in Old Georgian: action noun dazylema(Abulaje 1973: 120). Georgian stem-initial z is due to a simplification of the consonant cluster. The Megrelian form (action noun rgyimua-) underwent a consonant metathesis and a noticeable semantic shift. For Laz cf. action noun o-(n)^yim-u and past participle gyimer- 'crumpled'. The stem presupposes a simple verb base *zyl- (cf. *cql- and Georg, cqlema'to press').
