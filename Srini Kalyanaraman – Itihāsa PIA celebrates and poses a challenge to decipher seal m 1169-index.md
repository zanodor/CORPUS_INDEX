Itihāsa.PIA celebrates and poses a challenge to decipher seal m 1169. PIA, the challenge has been solved
-- On seals from 5000 year old Mohenjo-daro in Pakistan by issuing brass paperweight momentos of seals
-- Drawn from Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization Indus Script Corpora,PIA gives momentos of brass replicas of seals as paper weights to First Class passengers
-- PIA challenge to scholars is to decipher the worth of the inscription on Seal m1169
-- The challenge has been met and script has been deciphered. All 8000+ of the Indus Script Inscriptions have been deciphered.as wealth accounting ledgers, written down by scribes and Supercargo, कारणी kāraṇī, कारणीक kāraṇīka, representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale.
-- Yes, the artisans , lapidaries, turners, smiths and seafaring merchants from sites like Mohenjodaro and 2000+ sites (over 76%) on Sarasvati River Basin, documented the wealth of the nation on ledgers and catalogues called seals, tablets, epigraphs, sculptural rebus signifiers of Meluhha, Bharatiya sprachbund, 'speech union' words..
The momentos are offered with an open challenge to scholars to decipher the worth of the seals. The challenge has been met and the worth of the seals has been computed. The seals constitute documentations of wealth created by artisans, smiths,lapidaries, seafaring merchants and the treasure deposited in the Guild Treasury of the Nation. This documentation helps narrate the Economic History of Ancient Bharat, that is India, from 4th m.BCE with epigraphic and

archaeological evidence. This narration explains how Bharat became a Super Economic Power ca. 4th m.BCE
Consider that the first inscription incised on a potsherd was dated to ca.3300 BCE at Harappa. Here is the Indus Script Inscription found at Harappa by HARP team. It says tagara kolimi 'tin smithery'. The hieroglyphs are: 1.three; and 2. tabernae montana fragrant flower which is called tagaraka.The rebus readings are: kolom 'three' rebus:kolimi 'smithy, forge' PLUS tagaraka 'tabernae montana five-petaled flower' rebus: tagara 'tin ore'.
These shining brass momentos are mounted on wood or quartzite, marble or turquoise stones. The replica is carefully, with reverence, wrapped in silk cloth.
At the back of the momento distributed to passengers traveling on PIA flights,an explanation is provided by PIA on a pasted explanatory note.
The pasted note reads: "Seals from Mohenjodaro 5000 year old. These seals have thrown an open challenge to the scholars to decipher their worth. Indus Valley Civilizatio flourished five thousand years ago in Pakistan. The inhabitants lived largely by agriculture but also maintained trade with lands as far away as Mesopotamia."
Read on and see the exquisite brass momentos...

Classic INDUS VALLEY Harappan Civilization SEAL Stamp from Mohenjo Daro (aka Moenjodaro) 2500 BC Ruins ~ Museum Antiquity Replica Seal is made of Brass affixed to a layered White Quartzite base. The seal depicts a tricephalic (three headed) animal with the head of an antelope, unicorn and bull. Vintage PIA Pakistan Airline Souvenir Gift in Original BOX. This appears to be a souvenir given to first class customers. Circa 1970s.

Box has edge wear and all four corner flaps are torn. Seals from the Indus Valley Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are the two most important ancient cities to have been discovered by archaeologists in the Indus Valley in what is today Pakistan and northeast India. They existed at the same time as civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia with comparable complexity and technology. Indus Seals were carved out of stone and then fired to make them more durable. Over 3,500 seals have been found so far. The most typical Indus seal is square, with a set of symbols along the top, an animal in the centre, and one or more symbols at the bottom. Animals found on the seals include rhinoceros, elephants, unicorns and bulls. On the back is a projection, probably to hold while pressing the seal into other materials such as clay. The projections also have a hole for thread, presumably so the seal can be worn or carried as a necklace. The symbols at the top of the seal are generally thought to form the script of the Indus Valley language. The seals were pressed into soft clay to seal the mouths of jars and, as suggested by the imprint of fabric on the back of some seal impressions, were used to create clay tags for sacks of traded goods such as grain. Indus Valley seals have been found as far afield as Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) in the cities of Umma and Ur, in Central Asia and on the coast of the Arabian Peninsula.

Forty years ago, Pakistan Intl Airlines (PIA) issued a paperweight memento to airline passengers travelling between Karachi and Islamabad. The memento was a paperweight about 3 in. square. A copper plate with a replica of Seal m1169 Mohenjodaro is mounted either on wood or on turquoise stone. The memento is distrubuted to promote awareness about the civilizational heritage of Pakistan dating back to over 5000 years. The write-up on a blurb pasted on the back of the paperweight challenges researchers to decipher the script. The blurb reads: "Seals from Mohenjodaro 5000 year old. These seals have thrown open a challenge to the scholars to decipher their worth. Indus Valley civilization flourished five thousand years ago in Pakistan. The inhabitants lived largely on agriculture but also maintained trade with lands as far away as Mesopotamia."
An image and inscription of the seal used as a model for the mementos is presented below:
m1169 Pict-58: Composite motif: body of an ox and three heads: of a one-horned bull (looking forward), of antelope (looking backward), and of short-horned bull (bison) (looking downward).
Same text message is presented together with an ox on a PIA memento with a wood base (instead of turquoise used for a memento on turquoise stone base).

Another PIA momento mounted on a wooden base of the paper-weight. It carries the same inscription as on m1169. Mlecchita vikalpa (Meluhha cipher) provides a framework for decipherment of the inscriptions on such Mohenjodaro seals and seals from over 2000 archaeological sites of the civilization of the Bronze Age which become part of the Indus Script Corpora as new excavation results get reported.

Pictorial motif of three combined animals:

Parenthesis which encloses the bird is a split lozenge or ingot shape: mũh 'a face' in Indus Script Cipher signifies mũh, muhã 'ingot' or muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time in a native smelting furnace.'
sal 'splinter' rebus: sal 'workshop'. Thus the hypertext composed of four hieroglyphs: bird, ingot, parenthesis, splinter is a Meluhha expression which signifies: workshop (for) magnetite, ferrite ore, steel ingot .

kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'.
The inscription on Mohenjodaro seal m1169 is thus a repository of technical information about metalwork produced by the artisan guild of smithy/forge and transacted for trade. The metalwork catalogue documents the wealth created and traded by working with 1. magnetite (ferrite) ore in furnaces to produce hard iron (steel); 2 bharata, alloy of copper, pewter, tin; 3. copper, ayas metal alloy; 5. metals engraving/sculpting using cire perdue (lost-wax) technique to produce ingots and metal implements.
