Artificers venerate their ancestors. ḍhangra 'bull' rebus ṭhākur 'blacksmith' the ziggurat; Indus Script evidence
The protome of a bull with horns adorned the summit of the early ziggurat. This bull is an Indus Script hieroglyph: ḍhangra 'bull'.danga 'mountain range' ḍhangar 'blacksmith'. Mth. ṭhākur ʻ blacksmith ʼ (CDIAL 5488)
"The drawing of a detail on a stone relief from the palace of Assurbanipal at Niniveh (7th century) which provides a rare glimpse of the ancient representations of a ziggurrat. On top is a horned shrine. The scene is in the ancient country of Elam, city uncertain, although we know that the city ziggurrat at Susa had horns of burnished bronze. This drawing was made by the 19th century French artist William Boutcher. The original slab was lost in 1854 when a raft carrying a large number of Assyrian sculptures from Baghdad to Basra was sunk by bandits near Qurna."
Two tiered ziggurats are shown on Sit Shamshi 'Sunrise Ceremony' Bronze -- one is the high temple on the mound ziggurat; the other is the lower level temple, a tiered temple shaped like the ziggurat. The lower temple is kole.l 'smithy, forge' rebus: kole.l 'temple'.
Indus Script hieroglyphs kole.l 'temple' rebus: kole.l 'smithy, forge' PLUS baṭa 'rimless pot' rebus: baṭa 'iron' bhaṭa 'furnace'. This monograph presents many Indus Script hieroglyphs which can be demonstrated to be metalwork wealth accounting ledgers by Meluhha artisans.
The eight bun ingot shape blobs flanking the high ziggurat signify अष्ट -धातु eight dhātu-s, the eight metals collectively (as gold , silver , copper , tin , lead , brass , iron , and steel) (MonierWilliams) Elamite craftsmen acquired new metallurgical techniques for the execution of large monuments, statues and reliefs.

The figure on the front wears only a belt and has his curled hair parted in the center. He embraces a bull on either side of his torso, his arm around their neck. On the back of each bull stands a large bird.
Chlorite vessel found at Khafajeh: Ht 11.5 cm. 2,600 BCE, Khafajeh, north-east of Baghdad (Photo from pg. 69 of D. Collon's 1995 Ancient Near Eastern Art). The vessel was made somewhere east of Baghdad, possibly in Iran, and transported to Khafajeh where it was found. At the left of the panel, a man wearing a net skirt is kneeling on a pair of Zebus who are standing back to back. He is holding streams of water showering down onto vegetables and a palm tree. The wavy line above his head may be rain clouds, they share the sky with a crescent moon and a rosette sun. The second figure is also depicted with a rosette at his shoulder. He has a snake in each hand and is standing between two felines, both turned in his direction. At the right of the panel, a bull is being attacked by a large bird (eagle) and a lion while another small animal faces the other way. This image was created by rotating the straight sided vessel for the exposure of the photograph. https://www2.uned.es/geo-1-historia-antiguauniversal/MESOPOTAMIA/ARQUITECTURA_MESOPOTAMIA.htm
Sumer and Akkadian empire 4100 to 2000 BCE
"The cuneiform names for some of the earliest cities incorporate a sign representing the raised mound of the main temple platform, which (then as now) was clearly visible across the flat alluvium plain...Eridu, Ur, Uruk and Larsa were actually within sight of one other, competing for resources and dominance with about a dozen other city-states, such as Lagash, Umma, Kish, Adab and Shurrupak. The only exception was Nippur, which housed the temple of Enlil, the paramount god of the pantheon, and thus was treated as a kind of national shrine. Temple and Palace: Two Key Institutions. The temple in Sumerian city-states functioned primarily as economic institutions, central authorities which collected and distributed surpluses: agricultural goods and products of the specialized industries, such as metal working and weaving, which they supervised. Temples played a role with religious, economic and social dimensions that we still do not fully understand (the very terms “religious,” “economic” and “social” are modern constructs that we use todescribe behaviors and structures for which there was no true counterpart in ancient times)."

In this collection, found in the Abu Temple, there are eight bearded standing male figures, one clean-shaven standing male, one kneeling male, and two standing females. All of the figures display large wide open eyes, many of which are inlaid. Additionally, some of the figure's eyebrows are also inlaid. Males wear fringed skirts and belts and females wear robes with a cloak draped over the left shoulder. All of the figures hold their hands before them, many are clasping a cup. The figures are thought to represent worshippers.

Gold, lapis lazuli, carnelian. Head dress.ca. 2600–2500 B.C.E.Mesopotamia, Ur (modern Tell alMuqayyar) L. 15 1/8 in. (38.5 cm)
Kings and nobles became increasingly powerful and independent of temple authority during the course of the Early Dynastic period (2900–2350 B.C.), although the success of a king's reign was considered to depend on support from the gods. A striking measure of royal wealth was the cemetery in the city of Ur, in which sixteen royal tombs were excavated in the 1920s and 1930s by Sir Leonard Woolley. These tombs consisted of a vaulted burial chamber for the king or queen, an adjoining pit in which as many as seventy-four attendants were buried, and a ramp leading into the grave from the ground.
This delicate chaplet of gold leaves separated by lapis lazuli and carnelian beads adorned the forehead of one of the female attendants in the so-called King's Grave. In addition, the entombed attendants wore necklaces of gold and lapis lazuli, gold hair ribbons, and silver hair rings. Since gold, silver, lapis, and carnelian are not found in Mesopotamia, the presence of these rich adornments in the royal tomb attests to the wealth of the Early Dynastic kings as well as to the existence of a complex system of trade that extended far beyond the Mesopotamian River valley.

A hunting god (full-face) has a bow and an arrow (?) over his shoulder; a quiver with tassel attached hangs on his back. On the left hand mountain stands a small tree and Ishtar (full-face) who is winged and armed with weapons including an axe and a mace rising from her shoulders. She is holding a bush-like object, probably a bunch of dates, above the sun-god's head. The sun-god Shamash with rays, holding a serrated blade, is just begining to emerge from between two square topped moutains.

The water god Ea stands to the right with one foot placed on the right hand mountain. He stretches out his right hand towards an eagle, probably the Zu bird who stole the tablets of destiny. A couchant bull lies between his legs and streams of water and fish flow from his shoulders. Behind him stands his two-faced attendant god Usimu with his right hand raised. All wear the multiple-horned head-dresses of deities. The male figures are bearded and Usimu has a double beard and wears a flounced skirt. Ea and Ishtar both wear flounced robes and the fourth complete figure wears a striped skirt which either has a cod-piece or is hitched up in front. This god wears his hair in a long curl down the left side, reminiscent of those worn by bull-men and Ishtar has two similar curls hanging down, one on either side, while Ea and Shamash wear their hair in a triple bun. The scales of the mountain are continued in a horizontal band all round the lower part of the seal and it is on this band that the figures are standing. There is a two line inscription in a frame and below it a lion is pacing towards the right and roaring. The cylinder is slightly concave in shape." https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1891-05092553

This Akkadian example of a seal impression shows a hero wrestling with a water buffalo (left) and a bull-man struggling with a lion (right). The figures are separated by a tree on a mountain. The hero faces the viewer and dominates the scene. Akkadian seals tend to be arranged into clusters of figures that display physical tension in scenes of active combat.

Cylinder seal impression; scene representing mythological beings, bulls and lions in conflict (British Museum No. 89538)
Akkadian. Chert stone. 2250-2150 BCE, Mesopotamia H. 1 1/8 in. (2.8 cm)
In ancient Mesopotamia, a cylinder-shaped seal could be rolled on a variety of objects made of clay. When seals were impressed on tablets or tablet cases the seal impressions served to identify the authority responsible for what was written in the documents, much as a signature does today. When seals were impressed on sealings — lumps of clay that were used to secure doors and the lids of storage jars— the seal impressions served to identify their owner and protect against unauthorized opening. Many cylinder seals have survived because they were made of durable materials, particularly stone, but also metal and fired clay. Perforated through the middle like a bead, seals were also believed to have apotropaic, or protective, functions and were worn as jewelry or pinned on garments.
The modern impression of a seal is shown here so that the entire design can be seen. The scene is composed of two basic groupings that form an overall continuous design unified by the stylized landscape setting. In one group, two tall trees flank a hunter grasping an ibex. Above the man a cuneiform inscription gives the name of the seal owner, Balu-ili, who was a court official, and his profession, cupbearer. In the other group, ibexes stand on mountains, facing each other and flanking three trees. This seal was made during the Akkadian period, when the iconography used



24
by the seal engraver expanded to include a variety of new mythological, thematic, and narrative subjects. Here, the already ancient motif of the hunt is given a new setting in a clearly defined landscape. If there was a relationship between this imagery and the inscribed text, its meaning is no longer understood.
Sacred and secular ideas, fundamental to the beliefs of ancient Mesopotamian peoples, were visualized in the miniature images carved on the seals. The carver used intaglio, a technique in which the forms were cut into the stone, to create the raised impression. The challenge of the seal carver was to create a design that would maintain its balance and clarity when rolled out only half its length on a small surface or twice its length on a larger surface. On the left and right edges of the impression one can see how the rolled out design begins to repeat. Unlike much of the art of the ancient Near East, which survives only in a fragmentary state, cylinder seals are in the unique position of appearing almost exactly as they would have looked to the ancient people who used them. https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/329090
Cylinder seal of Ibni-Sharrum and its impression on clay, inv. n. AO22303, Oriental Arts dept., Louvre Museum Diorite H. 3.9 cm; Diam. 2.6 cm 2350-2000 BCE " A masterpiece of glyptic art This seal, which belonged to Ibni-Sharrum, the scribe of King Sharkali-Sharri, who succeeded his father Naram-Sin, is one of the most striking examples of the perfection attained by carvers in the Agade period. The two naked, curly-headed heroes are arranged symmetrically, halfkneeling. They are both holding vases from which water is gushing as a symbol of fertility and



25
abundance; it is also the attribute of the god of the river, Enki-Ea, of whom these spirits of running water are indeed the acolytes. Two arni, or water buffaloes, have just drunk from them. Below the scene, a river winds between the mountains represented conventionally by a pattern of two lines of scales. The central cartouche bearing an inscription is held between the buffaloes' horns.
A scene testifying to relations with distant lands
Buffaloes are emblematic animals in glyptic art in the Agade period. They first appear in the reign of Sargon, indicating sustained relations between the Akkadian Empire and the distant country of Meluhha, that is, the present Indus Valley, where these animals come from. These exotic creatures were probably kept in zoos and do not seem to have been acclimatized in Iraq at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. Indeed, it was not until the Sassanid Empire that they reappeared. The engraver has carefully accentuated the animals' powerful muscles and spectacular horns, which are shown as if seen from above, as they appear on the seals of the Indus.
The production of a royal workshop
The calm balance of the composition, based on horizontal and vertical lines, gives this tiny low relief a classical monumental character, typical of the style of the late Akkadian period. Seals of this quality were the preserve of the entourage of the royal family or high dignitaries and were probably made in a workshop whose production was reserved for this elite. Bibliography
