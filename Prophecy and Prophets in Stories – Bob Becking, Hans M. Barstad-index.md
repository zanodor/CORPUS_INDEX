Introduction*
Bob Becking and Hans M. Barstad
The fifth meeting of the Edinburgh Prophecy Network took place in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. The meeting was made possible by a generous gift from the Onderzoeksinstituut voor Filosofie en Religiestudies1 of the Faculty of Humanities of Utrecht University. We would like to thank Dr Christoph Baumgartner, associate professor for Ethics and co-chair of this institute for his willingness to support our meeting. Thanks to this financial support the expenses of two key-note speakers could be taken care of. The topic of this meeting was formulated as: Prophets and Prophecy in Stories. This topic was chosen out of two observations:
– In the Hebrew Bible an interesting part of our knowledge of prophecy is based on the parts prophets play in various stories. – The Hebrew Bible does not stand in isolation, but is part of a cultural continuum in which – with regional and temporal variations – stories on prophets were narrated and written down.
The aim of our meeting was to scrutinize the image of prophecy through the analysis of the narrative processes. Our expectation was that despite all sorts of variations, some features would become clear of the anthropological phenomenon of prophecy and its function in narratives. We are glad that a great majority of colleagues who presented a paper were willing to contribute to this volume.2 The volume opens with an outlook at the Context of Scripture. Meindert Dijkstra, “Prophets, Men of God, Wise Women: Dreams and Prophecies in Hittite Stories”, analyses a statement by Billie Jeans Collins. She argued that although prophets were active in Anatolia, we hardly know who they were and how they worked.3 She obviously thinks of prophets in the ‘Biblical’ sense as divine messengers different from male and female diviners and their methods

of divination. However, as soon as we define prophecy as an occasional form of divination, it appears that Hittite tradition knew to tell many a story about prophets, men of God and wise women. Some of them rather comical, as for instance the man of God who is seen by hunter Kessi in a dream being killed by a diorite stone falling from heaven. Also oracular dreams play an important role in royal stories, as for instance in the Hittite version of the “King of Battle” (Sar Tamhari) about Sargon of Akkad.
The majority of the essays are connected to stories in the Hebrew Bible. This section is opened by Anne-Mareike Wetter, “The Prophet and the King: Is There Such a Thing as Free Prophetic Speech?” She notes that in most of the Western world, the ‘freedom of speech’ is regarded as an inalienable human right, valued higher than the sensibilities of individuals or groups, and certainly higher than the dignity of political, religious, or economic leaders. On the other hand, scholars like Pierre Bourdieu and Stanley Fish argued that ‘freedom of speech’ is and always has been an illusion – anyone may be free to ‘speak’, but only those with “access to the legitimate instruments of expression, and therefore the participation in the authority of the institution” are actually heard.4 Her contribution investigates the dynamics of free speech in biblical prophecy, and the tension, inherent in the concept, between candour (in terms of content) and conformity (in terms of ‘instruments of expression’). She suggests that the biblical prototype of the prophet as one “calling in the wilderness” – marginalized, persecuted, and occasionally martyred – is in fact part of the ‘institutionalized’ ideal of prophecy (understood as critical speech) as construed by the theologians and scribes to whom we owe much of the biblical canon. The first part of her enquiry explores the social, discursive, and ritual(ized) background against which the performance of ‘critical prophetic speech’ could legitimately take place according to a selection of relevant texts. Secondly, she enquires whether the concept now referred to as the human right of ‘freedom of speech’ can be retraced, at least in part, to biblical narratives of prophets confronting the powers that be. Graeme Auld, “Isaiah and the Oldest ‘Biblical’ Prophetic Narrative”, pays attention to the role prophets played in the ‘historical’ narratives of Ancient Israel. He notes that only a few narratives involving prophets and kings are shared by Samuel-Kings and Chronicles in the Hebrew Bible: Gad and David, Micaiah and Jehoshaphat, Isaiah and Hezekiah, and Huldah and Josiah. Renewed attention to ideologically neutral linguistic features of such texts (infinitives absolute, markers of time, use/non-use of

corroborate their priority over the much larger number of non-synoptic prophetic narratives. William L. Kelly, “Prophets, Kings, and Honour in the Narrative of 1 Kgs 22”, pays attention to the story of Micaiah ben Imla. Prophets often disagreed in the ancient Near East, and many scholarly attempts have been made to find ‘discernment criteria’ for delineating the true prophet from the false one. However, the paradigm of ‘true’ and ‘false’ prophets/prophecy belies a more complex social reality. Kelly engages these issues through a reading of the Micaiah ben Imlah narrative of 1 Kgs 22, where the conflict over ‘truth’ is better understood in light of the social dynamics of honour and shame. The claims to the ‘truth’ made in situations of prophetic conflict in the ancient Near East cannot be disassociated from the social realities of power, status, experience and authority. Close attention to narrative shape with an eye toward sociocritical issues in 1 Kgs 22 seems to demonstrate that the legitimisation of royal war aspirations vis-à-vis prophetic oracles – a well-known motif throughout the ancient Near East – signals a context where honour is key. Pairing narratological analysis (Sternberg, Bal) with socio-critical research (Long, Overholt), it is shown that Micaiah ben Imlah’s assertion that a ‘lying spirit’ was sent by Yahweh from the divine council to deceive the prophets can be understood as a discrediting attempt at undermining the status of his ‘opponents’. Analysis of the honour and shame dimensions of the conflict, whether construed as interprophetic or between prophet and king, will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of prophetic conflict. Reinoud Oosting, “Text and History of Isaiah 20”, observes that the short narrative about the prophet Isaiah in chapter 20 contains clear historical references to the revolt of Ashdod against King Sargon II of Assyria in 711 BCE. At the same time, the references to Egypt at the end of the narrative raise questions about the origin of this passage. Some exegetes assume that Isaiah 20 originally addressed the Philistines and later was transformed into an anti-Egyptian text.5 Others maintain that ‘this narrative has only ever existed in the final form that it now has. The pursuit for an original, logically more consistent ‘Isaianic core’ behind these verses is therefore off track’.6 Finally, Blenkinsopp claims that the narrative in Isaiah 20 has a Deuteronomistic origin.7 Starting from the examination of the narrative in Isaiah 20 the syntactic patterns employed in this

passage and the linguistic and literary parallels between Isaiah 20 and other passages in the Book of Isaiah a different position is defended. A systematic overview of the linguistic and literary features of this passage helps in tracing the development and the origin of the narrative. On the basis of the textual features of Isaiah 20, there is good reason to assume that this chapter is not the work of one author. It seems that the original narrative about the prophet Isaiah has been reworked by a Deuteronomistic redactor. Thomas Wagner, “From Salvation to Doom: Isaiah’s Message in the Hezekiah Story”, argues that the Hezekiah Story contains a unique image of Isaiah’s prophetic ministry. Isaiah turns from a prophet of salvation to a prophet of doom within the story in a three-step process. His final message of doom is given to the king but it will affect to a later generation. Focusing on the Book of Isaiah, he lines out the change of interpreting the former prophetic message by inserting the Hezekiah Story in the book. For later redactors of the book two aspects became substantial: the influence of the individual on divine announcements, and the postponement of judgment. Blaženka Scheuer, “Huldah: a Cunning Career Woman?”, discusses the stories on the prophetess Huldah who appears in one of the more crucial times in the history of Judah. The peculiar fact that it is a minor, female prophet that is chosen to deliver the message of future destruction to King Josiah has been extensively discussed in biblical scholarship. Against the background of the various understandings of this fact in scholarly discussion, she seeks to explore the meaning and symbolism of the name of Huldah: Could the understanding of her name in later traditions influence the reading of the story in 2 Kings? This question is explored from two perspectives. First, although Huldah, meaning “weasel,” is viewed favourably in tradition as well as in scholarship, some Rabbinic sources describe her negatively as an arrogant person, as a rat. Is this, rather strong, attack on Huldah’s person and deed unique for Rabbinic sources, or could it be traced in Christian tradition of the time as well? Second, the link between women and weasels is an ancient one, based in a Greek myth of Hercules’ birth. According to the myth, a midwife is punished for her actions by being turned into a weasel. In ancient times, weasels were therefore often kept as pets. Finally possible influences of this fact on the Christian understanding of Huldah are explored. Matthijs J. de Jong, “Rewriting the Past in Light of the Present: The Stories of the Prophet Jeremiah”, analyses some of the stories on the prophet Jeremiah against some tendencies to be observed in Ancient Near Eastern and Greek texts on divination. In those cultures texts also were the end result of a process of writing and rewriting. In one important respect the rewriting of Jeremiah’s oracles differed from the rewriting of the Assyrian and Greek oracles. In contrast

with the latter two, the divine guidance provided by Jeremiah was not heeded by Judah’s main political decision-makers. The message was proved right in the end, but what his message was designed to prevent did happen: Jerusalem was destroyed and the state of Judah abolished. This required a twist in the literary version of Jeremiah’s message. The divine foreknowledge allegedly implied in Jeremiah’s oracles was the insight that the divine guidance would not be heeded, and that, for this reason, Jerusalem would not survive, and the state of Judah would come to an end. The literary version thus included the notion of rejection of the message, and its fatal consequences. But to call this a twist is, of course, our modern, critical perspective. For those who kept alive the Jeremiah tradition it was not a twist at all. For them it was crystal clear, what from the outset had been the true meaning of Jeremiah’s oracles, and they diligently spelled out this true meaning in the expanding Jeremiah-corpus. They shaped the image of Jeremiah as a figure prophesying utter doom for a disobedient and evil society, driven by the sincere belief that this was the true meaning and the enduring relevance of the words of God that Jeremiah had spoken. Pancratius C. Beentjes, “King Asa and Hanani the Seer: 2 Chronicles 16 as an Example of the Chronicler’s View of Prophets and Prophecy”, continues his research on prophecy in the Book of Chronicles. He observes that to the Chronicler, the alliance between King Asa of Judah and King Benhaddad of Aram gives rise to introduce the seer Hanani (2 Chron. 16:7–10), who is unique to the Hebrew Bible. Hanani’s speech appears to be a fine example of the Chronicler’s method of working and his theology. Attention will be paid to the structure of his address, its context, and some connection threads of it. Bob Becking, “Haggai and Zechariah in the Stories of Ezra and 1 Esdras”, analyses the role that Haggai and Zechariah play in the Biblical Book of Ezra as well as in the prseudepigraphic rewriting 1 Esdras. He arrives at the conclusion that in both narratives, these prophets are of great importance in the movement that will lead to the ending of the crisis of the rebuilding of the temple. In 1 Esdras, however, the way-out of the stalemate position is already paved by the story of the three guardsmen. When looking at the final composition of EzraNehemiah, it becomes clear that the ‘good prophets’ Haggai and Zechariah are mirrored by ‘bad prophets’ who try to hinder the divine programme for restauration.
In the final section of this volume, attention is paid to the post-biblical period. Hannes Bezzel, “Habakkuk in the Lion’s Den: Dan 14:33–39 (Bel 33–39)”, analyses the encounter between Daniel and the prophet Habakkuk in the apocryphic collection of Daniel legends known as “Bel et Draco”. Habakkuk is, in this story, snatched away by an angel to deliver some food to the former who is



6 Becking and Barstad
sitting in the famous den of lions in Babylon. According to Kottsieper, this story represents an independent tradition which deals with the problem of getting kosher food in the diaspora.8 Bezzel argues that the short legend should rather be regarded as written for its present context. Its intention is to bring together two men which obviously were understood to be kindred spirits: Daniel and Habakkuk. The “food” which Habakkuk has to offer to Daniel is his prophetic book with its centre seen in Hab 2:4b. Thus, the short legend serves the purpose of self-encouraging for some (proto)apocalyptic circles. The next three essays deal with the function of prophets in Jewish and Islamic stories. The essay by Elizabeth Hayes, “More than just a Pretty Coat: The Story of Joseph the Dreamer from Jewish, Christian and Islamic Perspectives”, is about a dreamer. The story of the dreamy dreamer Joseph (Genesis 37–47) has a rich history of interpretation, not only in Judaism, but in Christianity and Islam as well. The extent to which Joseph is viewed as a prophet varies considerably between these three interpretive traditions. Additionally, the story has been told and re-told in mediums as varied as poetry, painting, music and drama. Joseph’s marvellous garment is celebrated in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical ‘Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat’ and his embalmed remains make an appearance alongside Charlton Heston ‘The Ten Commandments’. Hayes supplies a compare and contrast synopsis of the history of interpretation of the Joseph story by emphasizing the prophetic actions of this dreamer of dreams and the way these actions are presented in story, song, poetry and painting. Eric Ottenheijm, “Elijah and the Messiah (B.Sanh. 98a)”, is looking for an answer to the following question: How and why did the Rabbis construe their own Elijah? Like the synoptic Gospels, Rabbinic traditions deploy appearances of Elijah to construe allegiance to and comment Biblical Prophecy. The towering figure of Elijah informs narrative strategies of healing by pious teachers called the ‘early Chassidim’. Other traditions depict Elijah as aiding teachers. Moreover he features as a prophetic teacher, addressing vexing questions on eschatological beliefs or legal issues. Finally, Elijah is alluded to by implication in a Rabbinic technical term, ‘tequ’ (‘let it stand unresolved’), as referring to his role in the eschatological decisions on halakhic or theological debates. However, his role in narratives is ambiguous where his appearance seems to question the validity of Rabbinic culture of study of the Torah (exegesis and dialectical study) from the point of prophecy and radical piety (mystical knowledge). These functions find their intertextual authority in the ascent to

Introduction 7
Heaven (2 Kings 2:11) and the mentioning of Elijah as the herald of eschatology (Mal. 3:23; Eccl. 48:10) but also seem to represent, albeit in a disguised form, older forms of religious authority. Rabbinic sources thus present a particular rereading of Elijah in their context of Rabbinic study culture. In our presentation we will discuss texts featuring the appearance of Elijah to R. Joshua ben Levi, a famous third century teacher. Ottenheijm assesses Elijah’s role as both commentating and authorizing the Rabbinic elite from the point of view of Biblical prophecy and zealous piety. Marcel Poorthuis, “From Noah to Nuḥ: the Making of a Prophet”, highlights the variety of images of the prophet Noah/Nuḥ in Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions. Noah is generally considered one of the forefathers of humanity. His qualifications for prophethood are far less universally recognized. Being aware of impending disaster he builds the arch for his family. The New Testament even emphasizes the unexpected and sudden character of the catastrophe at hand, without intimating in any way that Noah might have warned the people. In marked contrast, Syriac Christian and Arabic Islamic sources strongly emphasize Noah as a prophet constantly warning the people despite their mockery. The final paper of this volume relates on an early modern story on prophetic activity. Willem Frijhoff, “An Early Modern Young Prophet: The Heavenly Messages of Evert Willemsz Bogaert and their Recognition, 1622–23”, tells the story of a boy, Evert Willemsz Boogert who while staying at the orphanage in the city of Woerden received visions during a period of numbness. The reports on his spiritual experiences were brought to the local ecclesiastical and political powers. They recognized the veracity of Evert’s ‘prophecies’. Eventually they made it possible to have his dream come true: becoming a minister in the Reformed Church. In this capacity Evert Boogert, then named Bogaardus, served as first clergyman the community in New Amsterdam, later to become New York. Although the essays in this volume differ in scope and topic, time and context they nevertheless make one thing clear. It turns out that prophets in stories are part of a claimed – and sometimes invented – tradition. This social context of the narrators of the stories turned out to be formative for the shaping or reshaping of their prophetic characters. Transposed to the narrative context, prophets started a new life that on occasion was in continuation with their earlier deeds and doings, but more than once was the result of the malleability of the tradition.

Prophets, Men of God, Wise Women: Dreams and Prophecies in Hittite Stories
Meindert Dijkstra
1 Introduction
At the end of her paragraph about Hittite divination, Billie Jean Collins says that prophets were active in Anatolia, but that we hardly know who they were and how they worked.1 She obviously then thinks of prophets in the ‘Biblical’ sense as divine messengers different from male and female diviners and their methods of divination. However as soon as we define inspired prophecy and either spoken or dreamed divine messages as occasional forms of divination, Hittite tradition too knew many a story about oracles and prophecies. And also about seers, men of God and wise women. Sometimes they do so in a rather humoristic manner, as for instance in the tale of Kešši, the hunter and his beautiful wife. Kešši sees in one of his seven dreams a man of god being killed together with his household by a diorite stone (Ullikummi?) falling from heaven. Understandably, Kešši is very scared by this dream in which even a man of god cannot predict his own and his household’s disaster and Kešši’s mother needs all her wits to change his mind. All kinds of oracles and oracular dreams play an important role in royal stories too. Many of the texts I discuss here were found in one of the major archives of the Great Temple and Palace (Buyukale) in Boghazköy, the site of the capital of the Hittite Empire, Hattuša. The majority of the Hittite texts (including the Hurrian texts) stem from the Late Bronze Period (ending ca 1180 BCE). The texts are mostly written on clay tablets in cuneiform script and their Hittite language preserves one of the most ancient Indo-European languages we know about. First, I would like to make some general remarks on divination, prophecy and ritual practitioners in Hittite tradition. Secondly, I will say a few words on the use of religious texts ascribed to famous seers of the past in Hittite tradition. Finally, I hope to give a few examples of the use of dreams, divine messages and the use of other means of divination in Hittite stories and rituals.

2 Seers, Wise Women and Men of God
Indeed as far as I know, the many Hittite (and Hurrian) religious texts from Anatolia do not mention a kind of prophetic office comparable with that of the West Semitic nābîʾ, let alone remind us of the religious and political activity in the stories of the Biblical prophets and their books. Of course, we find letters and other documents, in which oracular reports and other kinds of divine messages such as dreams are forwarded to the Hittite king as in Mari and elsewhere.2 However we look in vain for collections of divine oracles, such as were copied and edited for the benefit of Neo-Assyrian Kings Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal, and their royal propaganda. But there are still some religious officials to be found in historiographic documents, narratives, rituals and prayers who proclaimed divine messages to the king, the royal house, royal officials and the Hittite people at large. The different procedures for divine consultation are spelled out several times in the famous prayers of Muršili II. For instance, he addresses the Stormgod of Hatti and the other gods about a plague, saying in his ‘Second’ Plague prayer: “[Or] if people have been dying for some reason, then let me either see it in a dream, or let it be established through an oracle, or let a man of god (lúDINGIRLIM-ni-an-za) declare it, or, according to what I instructed all the priests, they shall regularly sleep holy.”3 It reveals par example the broad spectrum of divine consultation, solicited and unsolicited, which was apparently dependent on a broad range of religious practitioners such as seers, augurs, extatics, men of god, wise women, godmothers and so on. In short, we meet men and women of god, associated with a particular god or goddess in his or her temple, who provide a warning but also a comforting role in the shady world between ‘the thousand gods of Hatti’ and people, in particular the king, the queen and the royal family and household. As elsewhere,

This is still a small harvest compared to the collection of letters from Mari and the Neo-Assyrian letters. An interesting feature is that in two of these letters a royal dream leads to an oracular investigation, a phenomenon also known from Mari. 3 I.

we find many documents with questions from an oracular expert with a simple answer “Yes” or “No”, intended to discover why something bad had happened and which of ‘the thousand gods’ was angry with the ritual patron.4 Methods to obtain such oracles were extispicy, in particular of the sheep’s innards TE.(MEŠ) = TÊRĒTE.(MEŠ) – as in Mesopotamia,5 observations of animal behaviour, bird oracles and casting of lots. The practitioners were indicated by the Sumerogram lúHAL or lúAZU, the Hurritic lúPurapši, all equivalent of the Babylonian lúbarû ‘seer’. It is obvious that Hittites borrowed this method of observing and interpretation of omina from Mesopotamia. However, in these mantic and ritual texts, experts and traditions from Hurritic provenance, in particular from Kizzuwatna (present day Cilicia) and Mitanni, and even northern Syria Mukish (Alalakh) and Halab (Aleppo) often seem to bridge the gap between the Anatolian, West Semitic and Mesopotamian world and cultures.6 Not surprisingly, the Hittite archives also contained collections of omina in the Hurritic language (basically CTH 774).7 Recently I established that the Hurritic word for bird eradi, has also the connotation of (bird)-omen,8 perhaps as a result of MUŠEN.HURRI, the Hurritic bird-extispicy. It was a special type of extispicy performed by the lúAZU/HAL and apparently an indigenous HurriticHittite method of divination. It seems that ‘the man of God’ and his female counterpart comes closest to what we traditionally would call a prophet. Sometimes the term lúDINGIRLIMni-an-za (šiuniyant-), which is used in Mursili’s Plaque prayer, is even translated by ‘prophet’.9 The Hittite rendering lúšiuniyant- seems to suggest a person

possessed by the deity, a divine spirit or a demon.10 In the tale of Kešši, a different term DINGIR-aš-ša LÚ-ya ‘(and) the man of god’ is apparently found. It is not certain whether the same practitioner is here meant. The last term reminds us also of the LÚ dU/IM ‘man of the Storm-god/Teššup’, who is able to stop the fury of the Weather-god or Storm-god in the so-called mugawar-myths.11 The idea that someone possessed by a divine spirit, in other words as ‘a divine’, might declare a solicited or unsolicited message from the gods, certainly takes us into the sphere of Biblical prophecy or, for that matter, into the West Semitic divinatory roots of the extatic nabiʾ. The problem is that we have as yet found no examples of his prophetical performance for comparison, as Billie Collins rightly observed. But there exists at least one example of a lúpurapši ‘seer’ delivering an ‘oracle of salvation’. A divine message of the kind as we find them in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions, collections of oracles, the inscription of Zakir of Hamath and also the Old Testament. It is quoted in the tenth Tablet of the Hišuwaš-festival (CTH 628), again a ritual of Kizzuwatnian origin. This festival to honour the Storm-god of Manuzziya included a ceremony for the military success of the king:12
One of the musicians who stands in the gate of the god will blow the horn and one of the purapši-priests who stands on the roof, will speak in front of the king to encourage him the following words: “O king, be not afraid! The Storm-god will put for you, o king the enemies and the lands of the enemy under your feet and you will smash them like empty jars. To you, o king life, health, future heroism and prosperity of the gods will constantly be given. Do not be afraid of anybody for you will have them defeated”.

Prophets, Men of God, Wise Women 15
It is however also the study of prophecy and prophetical practices and genres in the Bible that warns us not to connect specific prophetic practices exclusively to particular practitioners. Nebiʾîm work miracles and miracle working men of God and seers speak a ‘Botenwort’, a message like a nabiʾ. A nabiʾ is occasionally a diviner and a seer might act like a nabiʾ without making a seer or man of God synonymous with a nabiʾ. An etymological approach in our search for prophets might be useful sometimes, but it can also be a pitfall. In other words, it might be useful when researching extra-Biblical texts for prophets and prophetical phenomena first to search for comparable activities and religious practices and only to ask afterwards what kind of practitioner is said to perform them, if he or she is mentioned by his or her vocation at all.
3 Seers, Wise Women and Religious Tradition
A more interesting example for comparison with Biblical prophetical tradition is the phenomenon of authoritative religious tradition itself, certainly if it concerns the religious tradition of what famous seers and wise women have said and prescribed in the past. From Ugarit we already knew that the myths of Baal were not only written down by the famous royal scribe Ilumilk, but also were passed on orally by atn prln, ‘the seer Atanu’, the chief priest according to the colophon of CTU2. 1.6. Less known is, I think, that we find similar remarks of traditional provenance in Hittite texts, such as the Illuyanka Tales, written down by Pihazitti, the scribe under the supervision of Walwazitti, the chief scribe, but according to the word of Kella, the GUDU-priest. In the Hittite archives from Kizzuwatna (Cilicia), we find a number of rituals that were passed on as the oral tradition of three wise men, Ammihatna, Tulbi and Mati, the purapši-priests from the land of Kummani. In a ritual for the purification and restoration of the temple of the goddess Hebat, we meet another trio of lúAZU-priests (CTH 702):13 Dakuya, Asnunikkal and Mati. lúAZU is like lúHAL, the usual Sumerogram for the seer-priest or haruspex, for which some texts also have the Hurritic-Kizzuwatnian vocational term lúpurapši. Comparison shows that these Sumerograms and the Hurritic vocational term are synonymous and so interchangeable. It can hardly be doubted that this term is a derivative of Hurritic w/fur- ‘to see’ and a variant of prln / w/purulinni ‘the seer’ (Ugarit,

Emar, Boghazköy) derived from the same verb.14 The same Ammihatna was also SANGA-priest (a kind of sacrificial priest) of the oracle-goddess Išhara. Because in rituals the lúÁZU/HAL/purapši appears alongside the SANGA/Sakkuni-priest, their function was not identical. Ammihatna was both a SANGA-priest and a purapši-priest, in short a cultic official who was both a sacrificial priest and a seer. I know that this observation is still far away from what we understand to be Biblical prophetic tradition, but it bring us fairly close to the idea of the cultic prophet, which also once existed in ancient Israel.15 I am not here going to repeat or discuss the question whether or not cultic prophecy existed in the religions and cultures of ancient Israel. As we all know now at last, the Old Testament does not reflect one culture or religious tradition, let alone one form of prophetic practice. Where in the past theology often claimed a uniform prophetical tradition, a unifying monotheistic movement and a unique message in the Old Testament, comparative religion of Israel has shown a rather great diversity of prophetical personalities, practitioners, genres and practices. I agree with Lester Grabbe and others that the existence of cultic prophets is now accepted by a majority of scholars and that the question remains not so much whether there was cult-related prophecy but where we meet such kind of practice among the Biblical prophets and where we find cultic prophecy reflected in prophetical tradition. It is in cultic prophecy that Israel and the ancient Near East meet and share a common religious tradition in the Late Bronze and Early Iron periods and this applies also to Hittite culture and religion and its sources in the Hurritic and Mesopotamian cultures. God moves in a mysterious way, also in the traditions of the ancient near East. We have reason to believe that the Hittites were deeply influenced by Hurrian and North Syrian religious tradition. We cannot only point to the famous purapši-priests and traditions from Kizzuwatna mentioned above. In the 14th century when Kizzuwatna was incorporated in the Hittite empire, and when the wife of Hattušili III, the famous queen Puduhepa, ordered rituals from her homeland to be copied in the libraries of the capital of Hattuša16 in the 13th century, this land was already a cultural crossroad where also North Syrian traditions from Mukish (Alalakh) and Halab (Aleppo) were fostered. So we meet there too the similarly important traditions of the wise woman (SALŠU.GI = hašāwa-) Allaiturahi from Mukish (Alalakh) (CTH 780–781) and the

Hurrian woman, Ašdu (CTH 490),17 as well as compendia of the words and prescriptions of Ehel-Teššup, the seer (lúHAL) of Aleppo.18 In other words, the Hittites and Hurrians were obviously familiar with the idea of an authoritative, if not canonical, tradition of religious literature. In the light of such evidence, it is hardly surprising from a comparative point of view that in the much younger Israelite tradition Moses, the prophet and man of God,19 became the spokesman of a great number of canonical ritual prescriptions and that we find in the Book of the Twelve Prophets a certain prophet Joel, who was apparently working as a cultic prophet in the temple of Jerusalem, and from whom a ‘day of the Lord’ ritual to be used in days of drought, famine and a locust plague, was passed down to us.
4 Dreams and Other Divine Messages in Hittite Stories, Prayer and Ritual
The Apology of Hattušili III (CTH 81) tells us that dISHTAR – beyond this Sumerogram most probably the Hurrian goddess Shawushga, later known as the Hurrian Astarte is hidden – revealed in a dream by his father Muršili II and his brother Muwatalli that he should be appointed to be her priest because of his weak constitution.20 However, later in his career he became commander of the army of his brother’s campaign against Ramesses II (battle of Qadesh 1275 BCE) and on the way back married Puduhepa, the daughter of Pentipšarri, priest of Kizzuwatna at the behest of the goddess. Later the goddess revealed in a dream to Puduhepa that Hattušili would become king instead of his older brother Urhi-Teššup.21 The Hittite kings and queens hardly took a decision without the support of a dream. As such the dream is the most common form of an unsolicited omen in the period of the Hittite Empire. But dreams could

also be oracles, if they were solicited by dream incubation by special priests, apparently regularly so on the king’s instruction.22 Visiting the temple in order to receive a dreamed message was not a Hittite invention. The royalty were inspired by the stories of myth and legend to trust dreams as a mean of divine communication, even by such legendary predecessors as the Hurritic hero Kešši, the Hunter, the Sumerian king Gilgameš or the Babylonian kings Sargon and Naram-Sin of Akkad, all famous men of the past. And even the gods sometimes dream like men in Hittite myths. They receive divine messages and occasionally also prophesy. There is a mythological tale called ‘Ea and the Beast’ (CTH 351.1)23 in which we find a kind of dialogue between the wise Babylonian god Ea and an unknown creature. In this myth, Ea listens to a long prophetic speech of someone called a šuppalanza- apparently a domestic animal, though we do not know what kind. More interesting is that in a broken context this text twice mentions a special category of gods alongside the birth-goddesses and fairy godmothers, the DINGIR.MEŠ-aš DINGIR.MEŠ-ni-an-da-aš (šuiniaš šuiniyantaš). The last word is the same word that is sometimes translated as ‘prophet’ or ‘man of god’ and therefore in his edition Archi rendered the expression as ‘the fortune telling gods’:24 gods that are possessed so to speak with a divine spirit, which make them able to prophesy. It seems that ‘the Beast’ is one of them. Unfortunately, the text is still difficult to understand. Three fragments are known at present but a coherent translation is still not possible. So much can be said: the fortune-telling god in this myth announces to god Ea the advent of a new ruler of the gods, who will drive the old gods into the Netherworld. The text seems to be part of the Kumarbi cycle dealing with the contest for the kingship in Heaven. It is also familiar with the concept of Hurritic-Hittite theogonic tradition, in which generations of gods fight and succeed one another in the kingship of Heaven.25

The best known and the most famous example is the Hittite Song of Going Forth (CTH 344), which also influenced Hesiod’s Theogony in early Greek tradition, but there are Hurritic and Hittite fragments of similar texts.26 An obvious difference between this and the other texts is its long prophetic speech announcing a new divine ruler of the world. It is somewhat reminiscent of the so-called prognostic or Accadian Prophecies announcing a new set of regimes by someone speaking in the past. Notable is the idea of wise Ea asking this prophesying Beast whether this coming ruler is already grown up or still ripening. In his answer the Beast refers to the wisdom of the ancient gods, but why and how remains unclear yet. We can only hope for more fragments joining or duplicating this intriguing text that, as far as I know, has no parallel in ancient Near Eastern texts. The Hurrian tale of Kešši and the Babylonian legend Šar Tamhari (King of Battle) were rendered and recited in Hittite language and fashion in Anatolia. However these stories found their way all over the ancient Near East in the Late Bronze period as far as Egypt. To begin with the tale of Kešši and the legend Šar Tamhari were discovered in the library of Echnaton (Amenophis IV) in Achet-aton (Tell el-Amarna), only a small piece of Kešši and half of a onecolumn tablet of Šar Tamhari. However, from the many archives of Hattuša, many more fragments of the same literary works have been discovered. They are now conveniently known as Hittite Šar Tamhari (CTH 310)27 and Hittite Kešši (CTH 361.I).28 After the Amarna discovery of Šar Tamhari, fragments from Neo-Assyrian libraries in Assur (VAT 10290) and Nineveh (K 13228) have been found,29 but they are only small fragments compared to the texts known from Amarna and Hattuša. However the flake from the Nineveh version contained scraps of an episode narrating how Sargon went into the Temple of

Eulmas in Nineveh and sought there the divine approval of Ishtar for his enterprise. Dreams play an important role in the Sargon tradition, for instance in the Sumerian story of Sargon and King Ur-Zababa.30 Recently, I found a new fragment of the Hittite version joining to the main manuscript, which splendidly confirms the consultation of Ishtar and her dream-revelation to Sargon in this Hittite version of Šar Tamhari.31 Unfortunately the passage is still fragmentary, but enough has been preserved to get an idea of the procedure and message:

Sargon awoke again from his sleep And he started to say his word to his warriors: “Let them call my warriors, who have declared the road too dangerous for me!”
Most probably in this story Sargon entered the temple of ISHTAR, bowing 4 and 5 times addressing the goddess with an enquiry. Then the goddess hastens herself and approaches the supplicant. After that a dream or vision is mentioned, which reveals or testifies its message nine times. Unfortunately, it remains obscure what exactly was revealed to King Sargon, but at the end of the section the goddess appears to be speaking about the army of Sargon as ‘my army’. Sargon awakes again from sleep, calls his warriors and communicates the message of the goddess. It is a kind of standard revelation in royal literature. In perusing the studies of Alice Mouton for the role of dreams in Hittite divination, it is amazing to discover how often dreams gave guidance to Hittite life and history. Dreams play an important role in letters, prayers, rituals and indeed in the writing of tales and history. Hittites were extremely afraid of bad dreams, which they considered to be life-shortening. They sought also divine assistance against such life-threatening dreams.

Recently, I have reconstructed a prayer addressed to the god El-Kunirsha (CTH 342.2), the Lord of Dreams/Sleep.36 I will end this contribution with some remarks about this prayer. Of course, there is much more to say, but hopefully these few examples tell enough. This prayer is performed on behalf of the ritual patron by a salŠU.GI, ‘old woman’, a female divinatory practitioner and magician. The epithet is also often given to the famous wise woman and magician Allaiturahi from Mukish in northern Syria.37 The prayer is part of a ritual similar to other Allaiturahi texts. Also the fact that the prayer is addressed to an original West Semitic deity El-Kunirsha, the Hittite adaptation of El qone ʾarṣ, ‘El, the Creator or Owner of the Earth’ seem to plead for a prayer from the Allaiturahi tradition.38 Unfortunately no colophon saying has been preserved as yet in so many words. This El-Kunirsha is also one of the major characters in a Hittite myth: El-Kunirsha, Ashertu and the WeatherGod (CTH 342.1), of which several manuscripts were discovered in the libraries of Hattuša. Former research often identified it as a myth of Canaanite, if not Ugaritic origin. There is nothing to prove such an assumption, except the possibility of a general North Syrian provenance of this god and this myth. El-Kunirsha does not appear in Ugarit, but he was known in the first millennium BCE in the sphere of the god Baal Shamem and it is possible that his cult followed the wide dispersion of the cult of Baal Shamem in the ancient Near East.39

Usually, para epp- (without locative particle) means ‘to hold forth, show, proffer (a gift)’ (CHD (P) 118 2b 1’). It is once found with a dream as an object (KUB 52, 72 Obv.; CHD (P) 118b). How this accords with the expected role of the deity El-Kunirsha, addressed as a deliverer in this prayer, remains obscure because the closing lines of the prayer are still broken or missing. 44 Presumably El-Kunirsha or the SALŠU.GI on behalf of the god. 45 CHD (P), 49–50 SISKUR(mukeššar) pai-: probably, this ‘me’ is the ritual patron speaking.

In Ugarit, the old and wise god El, head of the pantheon, was known to have ominous dreams (CTU2 1.6 III,1ff),46 but the idea that he as god El-Kunirsha had power of the sleep and dreams of people, is new. He is depicted as a deity that can send bad dreams (literally hold forth to people) like other disasters and take them away. As a ‘Deliverer’, he can be asked to deliver the ritual patron from shortened years, bad dreams, wild animals and perhaps also diseases and demons. Even more interesting from a comparative perspective is, however, his chthonic character in Hittite tradition. He became here one of the older gods of the Netherworld, even the husband of the brother of the Sun-goddess of the Netherworld.47
5 Conclusions
This survey was not exhaustive. I hope I have shown that modes of revelation and divination in the Hittite and Hurrian world did not differ profoundly from those in the West Semitic or Mesopotamian world. In particular, dreams and interpretation of dreams by means of all kinds of solicited oracles and through handbooks played a major role. Even more interesting for our research was the knowledge and application of a kind of canonical tradition, impersonated by famous seers and wise women of the past. It is once more a reminder that if we study Old Testament prophecy we deal not so much with ipsissima verba of the prophets but with the tradition of prophetical personages adorned with religious authority, that is: a canon of prophets. And finally, even the belief in YHWH, as the El who neither slumbers nor sleeps, may have deep roots in ancient near Eastern tradition. Even if we admit that there is a significant difference between these Yahwistic beliefs, which developed and were adopted in the second half of the 1st millennium BCE and such views as expressed in these Late Bronze Hittite texts, we should also honestly take into account the historical and cultural distance when comparing these religious beliefs. And we should be impressed that, even in an early religious, polytheistic context

beyond dreams, oracles and other religious practices, not only a deus revelatus but also a deus absconditus could be hidden, who remained silent at times but who could be asked to speak and to awake, to appear to the worshipper, to send a message in a dream and even to deliver his suffering servant from divine anger and all the perils of the night.

The Prophet and the King: Is there Such a Thing as Free Prophetic Speech?*
Anne-Mareike Wetter
1 Introduction
‘Everyone loves a rebel’, and yet ‘a prophet is not accepted in his own homeland’ (Luke 4:24). Both sayings are equally applicable to prophets figuring in the narrative literature of the Hebrew Bible. To be more precise: especially prophets who, according to these stories, are not accepted by their contemporaries seem to be identified by the authors or redactors as rebels who deserve, perhaps not the love, but certainly the attention of the reader. Although examples to the contrary are present as well (e.g., Nathan or Huldah), the stereotypical prophet seems to be one ‘crying in the wilderness’ – at least figuratively, if not literally. The inverse relation between ‘acceptance within the literary context’ on the one hand and ‘appropriateness of acceptance by audience and/or readers’ on the other is not at all unique to prophets in the Hebrew Bible. As Irene van Renswoude points out, ‘dissident speakers of late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages often styled themselves as outcasts and as marginal speakers’1 in order to create or obtain a ‘license to speak’2 from the institution within – and against – which they moved. The image of one ‘crying in the wilderness’, so familiar for the reader of the biblical texts, is applicable to late Antique Christian critical speakers and philosophers of Ancient Greece as much as it is to Elijah, Jeremiah, or Micaiah. I. van Renswoude even discovers similar tendencies in the case of contemporary ‘prophets’3 such as Edward Snowden or, closer to home, Geert Wilders and other proponents of what Baukje Prins has termed ‘New Realism’.4 All of them seem to be instances or even prototypes of

the same schema – a schema that serves to legitimize not only individual critical speakers but also the right to freely voice one’s opinions per se. Against the background of new theorization concerning ‘free’ and ‘critical speech’, biblical notions of prophecy deserve reconsideration. This task is especially urgent in view of contemporary political discourses about free speech as both an inalienable right and a brainchild of Western culture, which in turn is construed as built on ‘our’ Judeo-Christian heritage.5 The purpose of this paper, then, is to investigate the dynamics involved in creating what Van Renswoude has termed a ‘license to speak’ in a selection of narratives ascribed to the Deuteronomistic school. The theoretical notion of a ‘license to speak’ is operationalized by means of an approach rooted in insights from cognitive linguistics.6 Concretely, I investigate whether the texts offer a more or less consistent, ‘prototypical’ image of a true prophet – i.e., one who ought to be granted a license to speak – and whether this image can be fruitfully understood in terms of ‘frank/critical speech’ on the one hand and (the right to) ‘free speech’ on the other. In the absence of direct access to the individuals on whose actions and words the biblical image of the ‘true prophet’

Hlavajova (eds), Citizens and Subjects: The Netherlands, For Example: A Critical Reader, Utrecht 2007, 253–264). (In-)famous proponents of this discourse are, in order of provocativeness, Frits Bolkestein, Pim Fortuyn, and Geert Wilders. Prins focuses predominantly on the content of this discourse and the (often inflammatory) language used to express it, although she makes some remarks on Fortuyn’s more general appearance as well. 5 As this paper is being written, a new discourse is gaining momentum in political debates in the Netherlands. Neo-conservative politicians (often those whom Baukje Prins summarizes under the heading of ‘New Realism’) point to ‘our’ Judeo-Christian heritage as the foundation of values such as democracy, gender equality, and, significantly, the right to freely voice dissident opinions; cf. e.g., E. van den Hemel, ‘(Pro)claiming Tradition: The “Judeo-Christian” Roots of Dutch Society and the Rise of Conservative Nationalism’, in: R. Braidotti, B. Blaagaard & E. Midden (eds), The Postsecular Condition, 2014, 53–76 for an analysis of this phenomenon. The present paper is emphatically not intended as grist to the mill of these politicians. I am not trying to prove that the origins of free speech as a political right can be traced to the Hebrew Bible, and certainly not that this right is tied exclusively to ‘our Judeo-Christian heritage’. Nevertheless, the similarities in the way in which critical speakers are framed or framed themselves in biblical, antique, early medieval, and modern contexts invite closer investigation. 6 For an introduction to this method and its application to biblical studies, see E.J. van Wolde, Reframing Biblical Studies. When Language and Text Meet Culture, Cognition, and Context, Winona Lake 2009.

may (or may not) be based,7 my focus is on the texts alone, and on the way in which a ‘license to speak’ is created and granted within the texts, i.e., by the authors and editors of these texts. Against the background of current debates on free speech, the analysis can be construed as a reverse genealogy. With Van Renswoude, I travel from Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages to the present, and back to the prophets of the biblical narratives, investigating not only in how far the image created there is indeed similar to that of more recent free speakers, but also whether the biblical texts offer something comparable to our political notion of the freedom of expression.
2 Free Speech/Frank Speech/License to Speak
According to Van Renswoude, the image of the critical speaker as a lone and often persecuted warden of truth in opposition to a blind and unyielding authority is no coincidence, nor does it necessarily reflect actual historical circumstances.8 She analyzes this phenomenon within a theoretical framework of ‘free’ and ‘frank’ or ‘critical’ speech, and argues:
Now as much as then, critical speech is the result of careful construction, negotiation and ritual setting. Speaking ‘freely’ is dependent on the willingness of others to listen. [. . .] The type of discourse nowadays refer[ed] to as ‘free speech’, which the Greeks called parrhesía and the Romans libertas or licentia, required as much rhetorical skill and careful strategy as any other form of rhetoric.9
‘Free speech’ in the sense of a political concept or right is generally connected to the rise of democracy in Ancient Greek about the 5th century BCE.10 However, as scholars like Stanley Fish and Pierre Bourdieu have pointed out, ‘there is no such thing as free speech’ – although the right to express dissident opinions may be granted by law, the form of this expression is never ‘free’.11 Apart from

Nissinen (eds), Constructs of Prophecy in the Former and Latter Prophets and Other Texts (Ancient Near East Monographs), Atlanta 2011, 175–195. 8 Van Renswoude, License to Speak, e.g., 172. 9 Van Renswoude, License to Speak, 5–6. 10 Van Renswoude, License to Speak, 17.

the political concept of the right to ‘free speech’, then, there is a discursive and rhetorical concept, or perhaps rather an ideal of ‘critical’ or ‘frank’ speech, which must abide by certain rules in order to be heard.12 Van Renswoude has coined the term ‘license to speak’ to describe the intriguing dynamics at work between speaker and audience by which the former legitimates his or her utterings, and by which the latter in turn grants this legitimacy. This dynamic involves (much) more than ‘linguistic logic’. In Bourdieu’s words:
It is clear that all efforts to find, in the specifically linguistic logic of different forms of argumentation, rhetoric and style, the source of their symbolic efficacy are destined to fail as long as they do not establish the relationship between the properties of discourse, the properties of the person who pronounces them and the properties of the institution which authorizes him to pronounce them.13
Put more simply: words alone are not just a poor area of investigation, but actually ineffectual if spoken by the wrong person, or within the wrong institutional context. It is the interplay between person, message, style, and context that determines whether a ‘license to speak’ will be granted. The legal right to speak freely is no sufficient, nor even a necessary condition for voicing criticism – and certainly not for being heard.14 Van Renswoude points to the Greek custom of the ‘passing of the skeptron’15 as eloquent (pardon the pun) symbol for the rules involved in any instance of ‘free speech’.
12 Van Renswoude, License to Speak, 5. 13 Bourdieu, Language, 111. It seems reasonable to expand the triad of discourse, person and institution to include habitus – those standardized, often unconscious, culturally determined body techniques that betray belonging to a group or a profession. Just picture the three men in Monty Python’s Life of Brian, two of whom are immediately recognized as prophets by their intonation and grand gestures. The third, however, fails to impress the audience – not because the content of his speech makes any less sense than that of the others (neither of them make much sense at all), but because he delivers it without the habitus expected in a true prophet. Unfortunately, the biblical texts offer much less information about the habitus characterizing a prophet’s appearance than does The Life of Brian. Consequently, habitus as a separate focus of analysis will not receive much attention here. 14 Van Renswoude, License to Speak, 4–5. 15 Van Renswoude, License to Speak, 5.

3 Mug Shot of a Critical Speaker
What, then, are the properties legitimizing a ‘critical speaker’? And how far are these properties dependent on or independent of literary and social, cultural, and historical context? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of free speech whether as a political right or a rhetorical ideal, or both? Attempting to sketch at least part of such a genealogy, Van Renswoude discovers one recurring motif in antique and early medieval literature in the image of ‘one crying in the wilderness’. Indeed, critical speakers such as Ambrose of Milan and Agobard of Lyon seem to have taken on the role of an outcast deliberately.16 On the one hand, the effectiveness of this strategy can be explained pragmatically. The reasoning ‘if someone was killed or exiled for his words, he had probably spoken the truth’17 is apparently independent of time and place. Yet historical and cultural context may be more important than appears at first sight. Do we accept the link between legitimacy on the one hand and persecution on the other as indisputable because it is, or because we are conditioned to do so by the socio-historical discourse (in the broadest sense of the term) within which we move? Is, in other words, the notion of the exiled and prosecuted truth-speaker a sort of Jungian universal image, or can the propensity to put one’s trust in an apparent outcast be historically situated? In Van Renswoude’s account, both approaches – the ‘inconvertible logic’18 of the persecuted criticaster and the historical conditionality of the notion are allowed to exist side by side. Her primary focus lies on the influence of Greek, Roman, and early Christian models of free speech (parrhesia, oratio libera) on the (self-)stylization of late antique and early medieval Christian critical speakers. However, she also suggests a possible link between this (self-)stylization and the image of a true prophet that arises from biblical narratives:
The biblical image of the ‘watchman of the house of Israel’ was key to late antique and early medieval understanding of the relevance of frank criticism for society. By drawing on the charisma and authority of the Old Testament prophets, critics legitimised the use of frank speech and enhanced its persuasive force. Perhaps under the influence of the ‘prophetic trend’, the semantic field of free speech changed. In the sixth and seventh centuries, words and expressions that used to be part of the

34 Wetter
classical repertoire of free speech (libertas, libera vox veritatis, libere loqui) as well as the New Testament of vocabulary of free speech ( fiducia, constantia) were replaced with an Old Testament vocabulary associated with the prophets (correctio, increpatio, admonitio).19
According to Van Renswoude, the biblical image, inspired mostly but not exclusively by the books of Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, adds several distinct ingredients to the schema of a legitimate critical speaker. One is a lack of elocutionary prowess, which underlines the necessity of divine inspiration.20 Gradually, she asserts, the rhetorical ideal of pagan philosophers was replaced by the ideal of ‘pure speech’ and ‘inspired language that was in essence antirhetorical’.21 Another new ingredient is the pastoral aspect of free speech, which presented the critical speaker as a ‘watchman of the house of Israel’.22 While the former two aspects – marginality or persecution and ‘slowness of tongue’ (Ex. 4:10) – move on the level of rhetoric and the legitimation of individual critical speakers (‘frank speech’), the latter – the conception of the speaker/prophet as a ‘watchman’ – has the potential to function as legitimation of free speech as a political concept or ‘right’. Van Renswoude’s findings suggest that the late antique and early medieval ideal of free speech arises mostly from a selection of books ranked with the ‘Latter Prophets’, and less from narratives about prophets in the ‘Former Prophets’. My focus is precisely on the narrative image of prophecy in the Hebrew Bible, and on the question whether the same prototypes populate these narratives, shaping and legitimizing the concept of ‘free speech’.
4 Prophet/Prophecy23
The appropriation of the biblical prophets in late antique and early medieval contexts thus paints a very particular image of these figures: as ‘slow of tongue’, hesitant to take up their task, and watchers over the well-being of Israel. More

Nissinen, ‘Prophecy as Construct, Ancient and Modern’, R.P. Gordon, H.M. Barstad (eds), “Thus Speaks Ishtar of Arbela”: Prophecy in Israel, Assyria, and Egypt in the Neo-Assyrian Period, Winona Lake 2013, 11–35.



The Prophet and the King 35
importantly, within these later contexts, the biblical figures serve to legitimize both specific characteristics of individual critical speakers and free speech per se. Does this appropriation concur with the prophets we encounter in the biblical narratives? Is the schema of ‘critical speaker’ indeed compatible with that of ‘prophet’, as far as these narratives are concerned? In the terms of anthropology and religious studies, prophecy is not principally concerned with ‘free speech’. Rather, it is a ‘form of religious mediation, or divination, the purpose of which is to transmit allegedly divine knowledge to human society’.24 Consequently, a ‘prophet’ can be defined as the mouthpiece of a deity, who, whether upon request or unsolicited, transmits this knowledge to his or her contemporaries. As Nissinen also points out, however, prophecy as ‘a socially and historically contingent phenomenon’25 resists overgeneralizing definitions:
Every time someone is referred to as a prophet, the reference is made to a representative of a type of person, presupposing a classification that determines the characteristics of that particular type, as well as a conceptual framework within which the classification is valid. Prophecy, therefore, is an idea needed, defined, and maintained by human communities that provide the matrix without which the idea of prophecy would not make sense.26
Following Wellhausen et alia,27 biblical prophecy has long been defined more in terms of ‘critical speech’ than in terms of ‘divination’.28 Of course, the Wellhausian notion of the prophet as the free and frank speaker who proclaims divine truths in opposition to worldly power structures has been severely criticized as based on romantic and/or Hegelian ideas about the
24 Nissinen, ‘Construct’, 11. Cf., e.g., Wilson’s famous application of this definition to biblical prophecy; R.R. Wilson, Prophecy and Society in Ancient Israel, Philadelphia 1980. 25 Nissinen, ‘Construct’, 11. 26 Nissinen, ‘Construct’, 34. 27 Weber’s notion of the prophet as a charismatic individual moving outside established power structures can be read as an expression of this line of thought as well (M. Weber, Ancient Judaism, New York 1952). As Nissinen observes, this notion is persistent enough to appear in current introductions to the Old Testament, despite radical deconstruction of its origins as rooted in a particular strand of protestant exegesis (Nissinen, ‘Construct’, 27). 28 The latter term in fact carries connotations of ‘false prophecy’ for many readers of the biblical texts, rooted as it appears to be in the ‘abominable’ practices of surrounding peoples (cf. e.g., Num. 22:7; Dtr. 18:10; 1 Sam. 15:23; 2 Kgs 17:17; Jer. 14:14).

development of Ancient Israelite religion.29 Consequently, the tendency to treat the prophets of the Hebrew Bible as a unique phenomenon whose role was very different from the prophets and diviners of surrounding peoples has made room for a comparative approach in which Israelite prophecy is analyzed within a more general framework of ancient Near Eastern Prophecy.30 As far as prophecy as a historical phenomenon is concerned, this paradigm shift is a welcome reminder that the religion of Israel did not develop in a cultural vacuum, nor always in opposition against its neighbors. And yet the literary, biblical image of the prophet, especially in the so-called Deuteronomistic history, does seem oddly out of place in the line-up of oracles, diviners, intercessors, and royal PR managers emerging from extra-biblical ancient Near Eastern sources.31 Conversely, the comparison with antique critical speakers hints that the schema of ‘free speaker’, which seems to lie at the basis of the Wellhausian construal, may be a fruitful framework of investigation after all.
5 Discourse/Person/Institution
Nissinen differentiates between ‘prophet’ and ‘prophecy’ as two distinct objects of investigation.32 However, within a theoretical framework of ‘free speech’, the two are inseparable: message (in the sense of both form and content) and messenger (in the sense of both individual characteristics and social

position) are mutually constitutive, legitimizing each other in a subtle game of raised and fulfilled (or frustrated) expectations.33 This is where Bourdieu’s triad of discourse, person, and institution enters the game, broadening our perspective on prophetic speech to include, besides person and (content of) message, the rootedness of both in conventions of speech and performance34 as well as the necessity to negotiate the approval of those in authority. In the case of biblical prophetic speech, at least three different ‘institutions’ can be distinguished: (1) a prophet’s audience within the narrative, which may itself consist of individuals with more or less political and religious authority, (2) the authors or editors of the text, and (3) the reader, whether implied or real. Each of these groups may or may not recognize the speaker as an instance of the schema ‘true prophet’ and consequently grant or deny him (rarely her) a ‘license to speak’.
6 Schema/Prototype
The human communities within which authors and editors of the Hebrew Bible worked are largely beyond our reach, and this applies even more forcefully to the communities within which the Israelite prophets functioned. However, cognitive linguistics promises tools to at least approximate the realm of thought in which they functioned, by abstracting from the biblical texts the categories, schemata, and prototypes that populated this ideological realm and structured Israelite (thinking about) being in the world. Basic to this approach is the insight that human cognition functions via categories, or schemata.35 Such schemata are neither binary nor universal; rather, they are polythetic and contingent upon socio-cultural, historical, and even geographic background.36 There is a continuous mutual exchange between a schema and
33 Needless to say, Nissinen’s claim remains valid in the sense that we have access only to the prophecies (and these, too, in edited form), not to the historical figures of any individual prophets. Nissinen himself makes this distinction very clear in M. Nissinen, ‘How Prophecy Became Literature’, SJOT 19 (2005), 153–172. 34 ‘Rootedness in conventions of speech and performance’ lies at the basis of form-critical analyses of biblical prophecy as well. However, while form-criticism assumes the possibility and desirability of deducting the original historical context of prophetic speech, my focus lies predominantly on the literary image of the prophet. 35 Van Wolde, Reframing. 36 An example of the way in which geography determines our schemata is the use of ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ to describe the layout of Egypt. Within a worldview in which ‘up’ equals ‘north’, and ‘low’ equals south, this use is counter-intuitive. Within the specifically Egyptian logic,

concrete instances (objects, persons, events etc.) that are categorized according to this schema and simultaneously serve to further flesh it out. A prototype, as defined within cognitive linguistics, is an ideal instance of a particular schema or category within a specific socio-cultural background.37
According to the Wellhausian construal, which is to some extent mirrored in Van Renswoude’s analysis of late antique and early medieval critical speakers, a ‘true’ prophet is recognized on the basis of a schema that is at least partly defined by strained relations with established worldly or even religious authorities. Whether the reader should grant a prophet a ‘license to speak’ then depends on the question in how far the same prophet is denied a ‘license to speak’ within the dynamics of the narrative. Needless to say, the present paper can only scratch on the surface of this issue. Nevertheless, the few examples that will be explored here can at least point out the direction which further research on the correlations between prophecy in the Hebrew Bible and antique, medieval and modern concepts of free and critical speech may take. Since dealing with ‘institutions’ is one of the foci of my analysis, I have selected individuals marked as prophet (
נביא ) who find themselves in direct contact with the powers that be (usually the king): Samuel, Nathan, Elijah, and Micaiah.
7 ‘True Prophets’ – A Series of Mug Shots
What makes a prophet ‘true’, in biblical terms? Dtr 15:22 is very clear on the issue: if the words of a prophet do not come to pass, he does not speak in the name of YHWH. However, as, e.g., Serge Frolov points out, the issue is more complex: a prophet’s message may be ambiguous, to say the least, and in some cases, the prophet may even be the communicator of divine deception rather than truth.38 Besides, as Freedman and Frey argue convincingly, especially prophecies that have ‘come true’ according to the text should raise the suspicion of the reader, since here the likelihood is the greatest that a prophet’s words have been tampered with in order to make them fit later developments.39
however, in which the course if the Nile determines the definition of these spatial categories, ‘up’ equals ‘south’ makes perfect sense. 37 Van Wolde, Reframing, 35. 38 S. Frolov, ‘1 Samuel 1–8. The Prophet as Agent Provocateur’, in: Grabbe, Nissinen, Constructs of Prophecy, 77–85.
39 Freedman, Frey, ‘False Prophecy’.



The Prophet and the King 39
The reader therefore needs other criteria in order to separate the prophetic wheat from the chaff, criteria that concern the person of the prophet as much as they do his (or her) message.
7.1 Samuel
As Frolov puts it, Samuel is ‘the first biblical character . . . who not only walks and talks like a prophet but also is consistently characterized as such’.40 Samuel indeed functions as an extremely conscientious mouthpiece of YHWH, and is generally recognized as such by his audience. He seems an ideal candidate for the role of ‘prototypical true prophet’ of the Hebrew Bible. At the same time, however, Samuel is an extremely atypical instance of the schema ‘prophet’, in the sense that he embodies the link between two very different forms of political organization: tribal alliance and monarchy. The role of the prophet within each differs considerably. Within the tribal alliance, the prophet (i.e., Samuel) holds political as well as religious power (e.g., 1 Sam 7:15). His audience – the group at which he aims his ‘critical speech’ – consists of the people at large. Within the monarchy, there is a precarious balance between the religious authority of the prophet and the political authority of the king. Samuel continues to address his admonitions to the people as a whole (e.g., 1 Sam 12), but the king is always included in his warnings: ‘If you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away’. Samuel retains the right to openly criticize king Saul, and even announces his replacement by ‘one better than him’ (1 Sam 15:28). Saul is stunned, acknowledges his sins, and begs Samuel to reconsider (1 Sam 15:24–25). When Samuel persists in his judgment that ‘YHWH has rejected you from being king over Israel’ (1 Sam 15:26), Saul does not argue – the word of the prophet overrules that of the king. Samuel, then, this apparent first prototype of the prophet functioning within a monarchical setting, is not at all one ‘crying in the wilderness’. Both the people and the king accept his words as valid, although this does not necessarily entail that they always heed his admonitions (e.g., 1 Sam 8:19). Although never referred to as such, Samuel does fulfill the function of a watchman of Israel, who warns the people against the consequences of their actions. Other mediums and diviners are banished from the land (1 Sam 28:3), but Samuel enjoys an authority that surpasses the king’s. Neither does he lack elocutionary force – addressing large crowds or confronting kings appear to be part of his daily routine. Last but not least, although he shows some reluctance before communicating YHWH’s first commission (the judgment concerning

40 Wetter
Eli’s sons, 1 Sam 3:15), it does not take much to persuade him to take up his office. His license to speak does not depend on conforming to a schema similar to that of antique and medieval critical speakers – the outcast who is willing to suffer for the truth. As acknowledged representative of YHWH, he is respected both by his audience within the story and by the potential reader.
7.2 Nathan
The next in line, Nathan, functions within a very different setting. He acts as a full-fledged royal advisor at the court of king David. He is not linked to a sanctuary, nor does he fulfill any of the leadership roles (military commander, judge) that Samuel had taken upon himself. His only task is to inform the king about YHWH’s plans (2 Sam 7), and confront him with his sins (2 Sam 12:1–14). According to Wilson, Nathan is an ‘establishment prophet’41 who, together with Gad, forms a couple of ‘central intermediaries [who] had the responsibility of maintaining the stability of the social structure, and they therefore promoted orderly change and opposed anything that threatened the social equilibrium’.42 Indeed, Nathan’s messages can best be understood within a framework of what Beate Pongratz-Leisten has termed Herrschaftswissen43 – divine knowledge, communicated to a ruler in order to enable him to reign effectively. As Nissinen has shown, such knowledge has a distinctly critical potential; the ultimate aim, however, is to sustain a ruler’s power.44 Unsurprisingly, Nathan does not encounter any of the hardships belonging to the schema of a prophet as ‘one crying in the wilderness’. Even his confrontation with David about Bathsheba (2 Sam 12) does not incite the king’s anger – rather, it underlines David’s suitability as leader of a people whose ultimate king is YHWH.
7.3 Elijah
Although an occasional prophet populates the next chapters of the Deuteronomists’ account (1 Kgs 11:29; 13:11–29; 14:2; 16:17), Elijah is the first after Samuel and Nathan to leave a lasting impression on the reader – and the first indeed to fit the schema of the persecuted warden of truth. His strained relations with Ahab, apostatizing king of Israel, and his foreign wife Jezebel, are

The Prophet and the King 41
proverbial. Ahab calls him ‘troubler of Israel’ (1 Kgs 18:17) – not quite undeservedly, since Elijah had started his career by announcing a lengthy drought that would be lifted only at his – Elijah’s – command (1 Kgs 17:1). ‘Crying in the wilderness’ is certainly applicable to this figure, much of whose life is spent in isolation, hiding from Ahab’s and especially Jezebel’s thirst for revenge (1 Kgs 17:2; 19:3). His messages have little to do with Herrschaftswissen in the strict sense – they are certainly not intended to keep Ahab on the throne. It is not until the last encounter between Elijah and the king that the latter repents of some of his sins (1 Kgs 21:27). Yet the reader is made to understand that Elijah is a prototype of a true prophet. His license to speak, however, does not depend on the stylization as an outcast per se. It is the introduction of Ahab as ‘more evil in the eyes of YHWH than anyone before him’ (1 Kgs 16:30) that legitimizes anyone who speaks out against him as a true messenger of YHWH. The persecution Elijah has to endure serves at least as much to underline Ahab’s and Jezebel’s wickedness as it does to substantiate his claim to the skeptron. Put differently: Elijah’s perseverance, even under persecution, validates his character as one worthy to communicate the words of YHWH, but it does not validate these words themselves – at least not as much as the miracles associated with Elijah and, perhaps even more importantly, the contrast between Elijah’s words and Ahab’s deeds do.
7.4 Micaiah
Next in line, still during the reign of Ahab, is Micaiah.45 He makes his appearance as the last prophet of YHWH in Israel, summoned after all other prophets have given their support to the plans of Ahab and Jehoshaphat, king of Israel, to wage war against Aram. Ahab is hesitant to call him: ‘I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but evil’ (1 Kgs 22:8). Nevertheless, at the urging of Jehoshaphat, Micaiah is summoned, and declares the encouraging prophecies of all his colleagues void. He does not, however, simply expose them as ‘false prophets’, who willingly go against the word of YHWH. Instead, he declares that YHWH himself has put a ‘deceiving spirit’ (1 Kgs 22:21–23) into their mouths in order to entice Ahab to go to battle – and be killed. As was the case with Elijah, Micaiah suffers the wrath of the king, who has him imprisoned ‘until I return safely’ from the battle (1 Kgs 22:27). Alas for the king – and,

42 Wetter
who knows, for Micaiah as well – only the king’s dead body returns to Samaria (verse 37). As Barbara Schmitz points out, the issue of ‘true’ versus ‘false’ prophecy is less than straightforward in this passage.46 Although most scholars tend to draw the line between the four hundred court prophets (including one Zedekiah, who performs a prophetic sign) on the one hand and Micaiah on the other, labeling the former as ‘false’ and the latter as ‘true’,47 Schmitz suggests that the narrative itself does not necessitate this evaluation. Rather, the text hints ‘dass die klassischen Bewertungen für Prophetie nicht (mehr) aufgehen, wie es z.B. das Prophetengesetz in Dtn 18,9–22 anvisiert hat’.48 According to Schmitz, the task of judging the validity of each prophetic uttering in the narrative falls to the reader. However, this task is less complicated than may appear from the mixed assortment of prophetic figures and voices in this chapter. Indeed, I would claim that Micaiah’s license to speak, as far as the reader is concerned, is established before he enters the scene, by Ahab’s derogatory remarks about him (1 Kgs 22:8). Ahab’s reputation as a king who ‘does evil in the eyes of YHWH’ is sufficiently substantiated to guess that any prophet who criticizes him must be genuine. As was the case with Elijah, the chapter thus presents a variation on the ‘crying-in-the-wilderness’ schema, whereby the legitimacy of the prophet and his message does not depend on marginalization per se, but on marginalization by a very specific individual.
8 Conclusions: Between Candor and Conformity
Almost 30 years ago, in his anthropological approach to prophecy in Ancient Israel, Wilson already insisted that prophets used ‘stereotypical speech patterns’ and ‘certain standard behavioral patterns’ that marked them as prophets.49 He claims, in short, that ‘[i]n order to be taken seriously by their society, the prophets acted and spoke in the way that the society expected prophets to speak and act’. In a sense, Wilson anticipates Fish and Bourdieu’s conclusions about the impossibility of free speech by linking a prophet’s authority to his positive reception by a ‘support group’ – or community, or institution, if you will. There are, however, two difficulties with Wilson’s approach. The first is

The Prophet and the King 43
perhaps most fundamental: the biblical sources tell us much less about the phenomenon of prophecy in Ancient Israel than they do about the ideas and ideologies of authors or editors of the post-exilic period.50 The second, however, is the most interesting for the approach taken in this paper. Paradoxically, more often than not conformity to the pattern of behavior associated with a prophet does not ensure that the latter is heard – in the sense of ‘taken seriously’ – within the dynamics of the narrative. Although a reader might instantly recognize a speaker’s use of the ‘legitimate instruments of expression’ marking him as a legitimate prophet, the persons he confronts within the story do not. In the terms of cognitive linguistics, the audience within the story regularly recognizes an individual as instance of a schema ‘prophet’, but refuses to grant him a license to speak nonetheless. Of course, as Nissinen puts it, it is ultimately ‘up to the community to decide whether or not a prophecy is worth communicating, which conclusions should be drawn from it, and what are the criteria of true and false prophecy’.51 It is the community (or the editors) who posthumously passes the skeptron to the prophets. To put it bluntly: in order to gain a place in the ranks of prophets considered as ‘central’ by the editors of the biblical canon, a certain measure of ‘peripherality’ vis-à-vis the religious, political, and economic establishment seems to have been an asset. This statement must be nuanced, however: only marginalization that results from opposition against an establishment that had already been characterized as acting in opposition against the commandments of YHWH by the authors/ editors functions as legitimation of a prophet and his or her message. It is clear from the biblical texts that the authors/editors support critical speech directed against institutions or individuals who fail to live up to divine precepts. But do they also hold up ‘free speech’ as an inalienable right? Do biblical critical speakers deserve protection, independent of the message they proclaim? To pose the question in this way is to answer it: although throughout the Hebrew Bible, a ‘good king’ is marked by the willingness to let himself be corrected by the words of a ‘true prophet’, freedom of speech is granted only to individuals worthy of the skeptron in the eyes of the authors and editors. Prophets who fail to live up to the author’s ideals are silenced radically: anyone exposed as a ‘false prophet’ deserves death (Dtr 13:5). Discourses claiming the ‘Judeo-Christian heritage’ as foundation of the political right of free speech are destabilized by the realization that many contemporary

Isaiah and the Oldest ‘Biblical’ Prophetic Narrative
Graeme Auld
1 Introduction
Many interesting features relate to the so-called ‘synoptic’ material within Samuel-Kings: the portions of these books which are shared with Chronicles. It has been argued that they are a major source of the familiar books, and even the root-system out of which these books have developed.1 However that may be, this paper starts from a plain fact. In a number of apparently significant respects, these shared portions of text are remarkably untypical of SamuelKings as a whole. Detaching these texts from their familiar contexts offers a fresh perspective for examining their contents, including their narrative portrayal of divine/human intermediation. R.F. Person rightly insists that what is distinctive in the Chronicler’s attitude to prophecy and intermediation should be plotted over against the synoptic material rather than the developed books of Samuel and Kings.2 A recent paper3 identifies four ideologically neutral indicators of the distinctiveness of the synoptic texts as a whole. (1)
ישׁ , ‘there is/are’, though it is found in Chronicles (4×) and is used much more frequently in Samuel-Kings (24×), is wholly absent from the texts they share. (2) הנה is not common in synoptic texts (only some 10×); and again it is used more densely in the rest of Samuel-Kings than in non-synoptic Chronicles. (3) The chronological framework of the shared monarchic narrative exhibits only quite minimal variation in terminology between Samuel-Kings and Chronicles. And here too the range of temporal markers used is less in the synoptic texts than in Chronicles, and less in Chronicles than in Samuel-Kings. Most notably, quite the commonest temporal expressions in Samuel-Kings as a whole ( היום and היום הזה )

are wholly absent from the shared texts. (4) The prevalence of the infinitive absolute (in its various uses) is similar in both synoptic and non-synoptic portions of Chronicles. But this grammatical feature is used very much more in non-synoptic Samuel-Kings. It is also used rather more in synoptic portions of Samuel-Kings than in the parallel portions of Chronicles (probably under influence from the density of usage in non-synoptic portions). To underscore this four-fold distinctiveness of the shared texts, it should be added that a temporal marker (3) is never found near an infinitive absolute (4), while such linkage is a common feature of the book of Samuel (some 10×). Further examples of such neutral indicators will be reported later in this discussion. This paper is in two main parts: the first reviews all but one of the synoptic passages relating to prophecy and intermediation; the second, the wholly exceptional situation concerning Hezekiah and Isaiah.
2 Synoptic Overview
The following shared texts report divine/human communication, with or without a mediator:
2 Sam. 5:19, 23 David asks for divine guidance before attacking Philistines 2 Sam. 7 Nathan on building a house, and David’s prayer 2 Sam. 24 Gad and David’s choice between 3 punishments 1 Kgs 3:4–15 Solomon’s vision at Gibeon 1 Kgs 8:22–50a Solomon prays at the dedication of the Jerusalem temple 1 Kgs 9:1–9 Solomon’s vision in Jerusalem 1 Kgs 12:15 confirmation of a word spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite 1 Kgs 12:22–24 oracle spoken by Shemaiah 1 Kgs 22 Micaiah and the prophets with Jehoshaphat and the king of Israel 2 Kgs 18–20 Isaiah and Hezekiah 2 Kgs 21:9–10 Manasseh 2 Kgs 22:14–22 Huldah the prophetess and Josiah4
4 The parallels in Chronicles to these passages are 1 Chron. 14:10, 14; 17; 21; 2 Chron. 1:3–13; 6:1239; 7:12–22; 10:15; 11:2–4; 18; 32; 33:9–10; 34:20–28.

Prophetic Narrative
2.1 Ahijah is Original
1 Kgs 12:15||2 Chron. 10:15 does not inform us about the content of the word spoken by Ahijah. It has been urged that this reference to a message by agency of Ahijah from Shiloh would have made no sense to a reader unfamiliar with the (non-synoptic) narrative featuring Ahijah in 1 Kgs 11: when we read the synoptic verse in the context of 2 Chron. 10, we can understand it (only) because we are already familiar with the parent text in 1 Kgs 11:29–39.5 However sensible this objection may seem at first sight, two strong arguments can be advanced against it. Firstly, there are two analogous situations in the familiar book of Kings. In the cases of both Jehu ben Hanani (1 Kgs 16:7, 12) and Jonah ben Amittai (2 Kgs 14:25), we find an oracle mentioned but no content reported. Secondly, in the synoptic verse, Ahijah is named differently from the other instances in Kings. Only in 1 Kgs 12:15||2 Chron. 10:15 is he called simply ‘Ahijah the Shilonite’.6 However, at the beginning of each other (non-synoptic) narrative in which he features, he is (re-)introduced with a title, whether ‘the prophet’ or ‘his [Yahweh’s] servant’ or both together:
in אחיה ]השילני[ הנביא
in 14:18. We עבדו אחיהו הנביא in 15:29; and עבדו אחיה הנביא ; 1 Kgs 11:29; 14:2 should deduce that synoptic 1 Kgs 12:15||2 Chron. 10:15 has influenced the drafting of Kings in divergent directions. Firstly, the model of this (puzzlingly brief?) synoptic note has been followed in drafting the (non-synoptic) notes about Jehu and Jonah. Next, the narrative in 1 Kgs 11:29–39 may well have been written precisely to supply the content of the word spoken by agency of Ahijah, and so satisfy the curiosity of readers of 1 Kgs 12:15||2 Chron. 10:15.7 We shall discuss below how the distinctive wording of this brief but apparently influential sentence relates to two further synoptic contexts.
2.2 Patterns
Several general observations follow from the listing above. Communication from or with the deity is reported in synoptic texts in connection with:
•
the founding kings, David and Solomon;
•
the first kings of the separated Israel and Judah, Jeroboam and Rehoboam;
5 S.L. McKenzie, ‘The Chronicler as Redactor’, M.P. Graham and S.L. McKenzie (eds), The Chronicler as Author: Studies in Text and Texture (JSOTS 263), Sheffield 1999, 83. . in 2 Chron. 10:15 אחיהו השלוני in 1 Kgs 12:15 and אחיה השילני 6 7 It is unnecessary here to rehearse the divergent traditions about Jeroboam and Ahijah (and Shemaiah too) in 1 Kings and 3 Kingdoms. Even where Jeroboam does not himself feature in the report of Rehoboam at Shechem, the word of Yahweh ‘by hand of Ahijah’ is spoken concerning him.

•
the kings of Israel and Judah who mount joint action, Ahab and Jehoshaphat;
•
the good kings of surviving Judah who come under acute external threat,
Hezekiah and Josiah;
•
wicked Manasseh.
Against such a background, the absence of any such role in the restoration of Joash after his grandmother Athaliah’s usurpation of power constitutes a remarkable break in pattern. It is mostly the king that takes the initiative in communication between king and deity (2 Sam. 5; 7; 1 Kgs 3; 8; 9; 22; 2 Kgs 22). Only once (in 2 Sam. 24) is it certainly the deity, while the two reports in 1 Kgs 12 are so brief as to be ambiguous on the issue. Most of the intermediaries (from Nathan to Huldah) are termed [ נביא[ה . Of the three exceptions, Gad is a ‘seer’ ( חזה ); Ahijah is simply ‘someone from Shiloh’; and Shemaiah is ‘the man of God’ ( איש האלהים ). While only Gad is termed חזה (2 Sam. 24:11), the related abstract noun חז]י[ון concludes the summary of the whole communication mediated to David through Nathan: 2 Sam. 7:17). Within the synoptic texts, ‘seer’ ( ככל־הדברים האלה וככל־החז]י[ון ( חזה ) and ‘vision’ ( חז]י[ון ) its cognate are used only in the David narratives.8 The participial form of ראה (‘seer’) is never found in synoptic texts; but other forms of this verb are used in visionary contexts: qal in 1 Kgs 22:17, 19, 25; and niphal in 1 Kgs 3:5; 9:2. These may have influenced the wording in 2 Sam. 7:2 (MT) of David’s request to Nathan ( ראה נא ); however, the parallel in 1 Chron. 17:1 reads simply הנה , and that is also attested by LXX in both verses.9 In synoptic texts, only David and Solomon are called Yahweh’s ‘servant’, whether by themselves in their prayers ( 10)עבדך or in divine speech to them through a prophet ( 11.)עבדי The sole exception – better, extension – to this is found in 2 Kgs 8:19, where the narrator writes ‘for the sake of David his servant’ ( למען דוד עבדו ). Correspondingly, only David (2 Sam. 7:18) and Solomon (1 Kgs 8:22) out of all the kings and intermediaries reported on are explicitly described as speaking directly to Yahweh. Despite broadly synonymous use of ‘ask’ and ‘enquire’ in (say) Isa. 30–31,12 it appears that the synoptic narrative deliberately distinguishes between שאל and שאל.דרש is used to describe the

By contrast, Chron. uses 9 חזה × in addition to 1 Chron. 21:9, and uses חזון again in 2 Chron. 32:32. 9 Samuel is styled ‘the seer’ ( הראה ) in 1 Sam. 9:9, 11, 18, 19; and in 1 Chron. 9:22; 26:28; 29:29; as is Hanani in 2 Chron. 16:7, 10. Elsewhere in HB, ראה is found only in Isa. 28:7; 30:10. 10 2 Sam. 7:19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29; 24:10; 1 Kgs 8:28, 29, 30. 11 2 Sam. 7:5, 8. . make essentially the same point ) 31:1 (ואת־יהוה לא דרשו Isa. 30:2) and ( פני לא שאלו 12

Prophetic Narrative
direct approach of David and Solomon to Yahweh, and דרש of the enquiries made about the divine will by Jehoshaphat and the king of Israel (1 Kgs 22) and by Josiah (2 Kgs 22), and in each case through prophets. We may add that it is only in these two ‘prophetic’ narratives that הנה is used, twice each by Micaiah and Huldah, and once by a royal messenger.13 If we can assume that this distinction in the root-text between שאל and דרש was noticed by those who extended the text as they wrote the book of Samuel, then it gives greater poignancy to the word-play in the earlier chapters about first Hannah ‘asking’ Yahweh for a son, and then the people ‘asking’ Yahweh for a king who turned out to be named ‘Asked-for’ ( שאול ). Non-synoptic Samuel uses דרש only of Saul consulting Samuel (1 Sam. 9:9; 28:7). And we find it in several non-synoptic contexts in Kings: 1 Kgs 14:5; 2 Kgs 1[5×]; 3:11; 8:8. In Chronicles, דרש is very much more common, some 35× from Saul (1 Chron. 10:13–14) onwards.14
2.3 Shifts in Perspective
The issue of context and appropriate perspective is particularly important for correct understanding of the brief reports in 2 Sam. 5:19, 23. Read in traditional canonical order, these ‘askings’ by David come at the end of a long series: Judg. 1:1; 18:5; 20:18, 23, 27; 1 Sam. 10:22; 14:37; 22:10, 13, 15; 23:2, 4; 28:6; 30:8; 2 Sam. 2:1. In each of these fifteen previous askings, as in 2 Sam. 5||1 Chron. 14, the Hebrew idiom is שאל ב־ . In Judg. 18:5; 20:18; 1 Sam. 14:37; 22:13, 15, as in synoptic 1 Chron. 14:10, 14, it is ‘the deity’ that is consulted ( שאל באלהים ); in the other passages, it is Yahweh ( שאל ביהוה ), as in the synoptic parallel 2 Sam. 5:19, 23. The attendant circumstances of half of these briefly described consultations are as opaque as the synoptic pair. But six of them (Judg. 18:5; 1 Sam. 14:37; 22:10, 13, 15; 30:8) mention the involvement of a priest. Then the still more detailed Judg. 20:27–28 talks of the ark and of Phinehas ministering before it, but does not explicitly state that this priest helped to secure the divine response. Then 1 Sam. 28:6 reports that Yahweh made no response by any one of three methods to Saul’s enquiry: not by dreams, not by Urim, and not by prophets. The relevance of context is this. When read as the final members of a long series, the circumstances of David’s enquiries in 2 Sam. 5:19, 23||1 Chron. 14:10, 14,
13 As already noted, הנה introduces David’s words to Nathan in 1 Chron. 17:1 and in synoptic 2 Sam. 7:2 (LXX), while only 2 Sam. 7:2 (MT) uses ראה . 14 R. Thelle, in her careful overview of such issues (‘Reflections of Ancient Israelite Divination in the Former Prophets’, in: M.R. Jacobs and R.F. Person [eds], Israelite Prophecy and the Deuteronomistic History: Portrait, Reality, and the Formation of a History [AIL 14], Atlanta GA 2013, 7–33), notes that שאל is used mainly in Judges and Samuel and דרש in Kings. The present paper explores the roots of these preferences.

Auld
just like the other less detailed and hence more opaque reports within the series, may be clarified by the other more detailed members of the set: even where it is not stated, the mediating role of a priest may be fairly intuited. Read on their own, however, or rather as part of a different series – in the broader context of the synoptic texts under review in this paper, where several features invite us to pair David with Solomon over against the following kings – David’s ‘askings’ may instead imply unmediated access to the deity. As reported in 1 Chron. 14, David’s ‘asking’ of the deity follows the first stage in his collection of the ark (1 Chron. 13). It is neither stated nor denied that there is a link between his recovery of this potent symbol of divine presence and his asking for guidance. However, divine irruption ( פרץ ) is a key element in both narratives (2 Sam. 5:20||1 Chron. 14:11 and 6:8||13:11). And the author of Judg. 20:27–28 may have intuited such a link between ark and divination. On the other hand, there is no explicit priestly role in the account of the ark’s return.
2.4 Exceptions
Within these synoptic contexts, two areas of divergence must be noted. The smaller one relates to Gad and Manasseh, and the much larger to Hezekiah. The verb ‘speak’ ( דבר ) commonly has ‘Yahweh’ as subject in synoptic portions, but almost always within reported speech.15 However, the actual narrator does claim Yahweh as speaker at three points. One of these is straightforward, and was discussed above: ‘. . . in order to establish his word which he/Yahweh had spoken by hand of Ahijah the Shilonite . . .’ (1 Kgs 12:15||2 Chron. 10:15). Within the narrative of David’s census, however, we find textual variety: Yahweh in Chronicles simply speaks to Gad, David’s seer; but in Samuel, it is Yahweh’s word that comes to Gad – and he is no longer simply termed David’s ‘seer’ but is first called ‘the prophet’ as well.
2 Sam. 24:11 1 Chron. 21:9
וידבר יהוה אל־גד חזה דויד ודבר יהוה היה אל־גד הנביא חזה דוד
Thirdly, and similarly, Chronicles suggests unmediated address by Yahweh to Manasseh and his people, while Kings reports the role of ‘his servants the prophets’ in Yahweh’s declaration of judgment.
15 The speakers are David (2 Sam. 7:7, 19, 25, 25, 28), Solomon (1 Kgs 8:15, 20, 20, 24, 24, 26; 9:5), Shemaiah (1 Kgs 12:24), and Micaiah (1 Kgs 22:23, 28).

2 Kgs 21:9–10 2 Chron. 33:9–10
ולא שמעו ויתע מנשה את־יהודה וישבי ירושלם לעשות... ויתעם מנשה לעשות... וידבר יהוה אל־מנשה ואל־עמו וידבר יהוה ביד־עבדיו הנביאים ולא הקשיבו
Assessment of this third divergence is complex: neither ולא שמעו nor ולא הקשיבו is attested anywhere synoptically;16 and ‘his servants the prophets’ is a theme of Kings never found in Chronicles. 2 Kgs 17:13–14 anticipate both expressions from 21:9–10. Discussion of the Hezekiah narratives will follow some further observations about word-usage. But, before passing on, we should note that Yahweh’s ‘word’ is attested in synoptic narratorial contexts only in 2 Sam. 24:11 (but not 1 Chron. 21:9); 1 Kgs 12:15||2 Chron. 10:15; and 1 Kgs 22:5, 19||2 Chron. 18:4, 18.
2.5 Additional Significant Word-Usages
Scrutiny of the language used in the portions of the synoptic texts under review in this paper had the unintended benefit of adding further non-ideological indicators of the distinctiveness of these texts within the wider context of Samuel-Kings as a whole, as well as of Chronicles, to the four noted at the beginning. (5) Huldah (2 Kgs 22:19) is the only synoptic prophet who reinforces her report of divine speech with
נאם יהוה (‘utterance of Yahweh’); and this phrase is never repeated in Chronicles.17 (6) In the same verse, she notes that King Josiah has ‘wept’ in response to the divine word; and no other character in Chronicles weeps.18 (7) Micaiah, protesting his integrity to the kings’ messenger (1 Kgs 22:14), is the only synoptic character to reinforce his words with ‘as Yahweh lives’ ( חי יהוה ).

1 Kgs 22:44||2 Chron. 20:33 that it has made its way into 1 Kgs 22:32 (like ‘living’ in 2 Chron. 25:12, noted just below). Non-synoptic Chronicles uses אך only twice more (1 Chron. 22:12; 2 Chron. 30:11), but Samuel 14×21 and Kings 14×.22 Items (7) and (8) deserve fuller discussion. While 5(נאם יהוה ) is one of the most frequently used formulae throughout the books of the Latter Prophets (it is absent only from Habakkuk and Jonah), 7( חי יהוה ) is much more prominent in Samuel and Kings; and its use in these books is part of a wider phenomenon. The whole cluster ‘life/live/living’ ( חי\חיה\חיים ) is very rare in synoptic contexts, and is found there only in 1 Kgs 8:40; 12:6; 22:14; 2 Kgs 11:12; 14:9, 17. Perhaps even more remarkably, there are only two further instances of this word-cluster in all of Chronicles; and each of these seems instructive in a different way. The positive statement about Joab at the end of 1 Chron. 11:8 that he ‘let live’ or ‘restored to life’ the remnant of Jerusalem ( ויחיה את־שאר העיר ) may have been an earlier component of the report of Jerusalem’s capture, but suppressed from 2 Sam. 5:9 as later drafts of Samuel became more hostile to David’s lieutenant.23 Then the use of חיים within non-synoptic 2 Chron. 25:12 could have been influenced by the nearby synoptic pair 25:18, 25 (= 2 Kgs 14:9, 17). If our proposal about 1 Chron. 11:8 is acceptable, then 2 Chron. 25:12 will supply the only instance of the Chronicler actually adding to his source-text an element from this cluster. By contrast, ‘life/live/living’ is a very frequent theme in Samuel-Kings,24 and also both Deuteronomy and Ezekiel, as well as in sections of Jeremiah.25 Independent testimony to later-biblical interest in this ‘life’ cluster comes from a different synoptic exercise: the comparative reading of 2 Kgs 18–20 and Isa. 36–39.

the Assyrians scorning ‘living El’; another, in 2 Kgs 20:1, 7||Isa. 38:1, 21, concerns King Hezekiah as dying or living. But in each book, there are instances additional to this already significant usage. ‘And live’ ( וחיו ) is part of a small Kings plus in 2 Kgs 18:32–33 as compared with Isa. 36:17 (in both verses MT=Rahlfs LXX); then, in the other direction, verb and noun are both very prominent (9×) in the large Isaiah plus (38:9–20) found between the synoptic instances in Isa. 38:1, 21. Yet none of this concentrated interest in ‘life’ – or in the deity adding to the ‘days’ of the king (2 Kgs 20:6||Isa. 38:5) – is reflected in 2 Chron. 32.26 Then the plus in 2 Kgs 18:32–33 sounds another interesting echo: it includes an instance of the infinitive absolute not attested in the Isaiah parallel. We find a similar situation in 2 Sam. 8:2||1 Chron. 18:2, where the substantial Samuel plus includes both life and death and an instance of the infinitive absolute.27 As for 8( אך ), four of the 28 pluses in Samuel-Kings are found within synoptic contexts. a. The first of these, at the end of 2 Sam. 23:10, is probably original – the much shorter parallel in 1 Chron. 11:14 may result from haplography. b. אך introduces the note in 2 Kgs 22:7 about honest artisans of whom no financial accounts were required.28 c. It opens the longer and related note in 2 Kgs 12:1416, within an earlier report of temple reconstruction, which ends with a similar statement about accounts not being required of the skilled workers.29 It is part of a text-critical puzzle relating to the move of the daughter of Pharaoh to new quarters in Jerusalem:

26 That expression can be found (only?) in Ps. 61:7 and Prov. 10:27. The Chronicler uses ‘days’ in his Hezekiah narrative only in (the synoptic) 2 Chron. 32:24 and in 32:26. 27 ומדד in 4Q51 (MT reads וימדד ) may be read as a 2nd instance of IA in this verse. 28 אך is found again in 2 Kgs 23:9. On Josiah’s dealings with the priests of the bamoth see L. Kucová, ‘Common Source Theory and Composition of the Story of the Divided Monarchy in Kings with Special Emphasis on the Account of Josiah’s Reform’, Edinburgh University PhD Thesis 2005, 135–39) – the bamoth themselves were the topic of the (original?) 1 Kgs 22:44||2 Chron. 20:33. And אך is used once more in the Josiah narrative: 2 Kgs 23:26 may well depend on Jer 2:35. 29 2 Kgs 12:9–16 is broadly parallel to 2 Chron. 24:8–14.

texts, are linked in at least ten contexts in non-synoptic Samuel. ‘Day’ (3) and ‘life’ (7) are also linked 8× in non-synoptic Samuel-Kings: כל־ימי חייו in 1 Sam. 1:11; 7:15; 1 Kgs 5:1; 11:34; 15:5, 6; 2 Kgs 25:29, 30 (|| Jer. 52:33, 34).30 Similarly, אך (8) introduces a temporal expression including ‘days’ (3) in both 1 Kgs 11:12, 39. Presumably, just as in the case of the infinitive absolute, heavy usage of אך in non-synoptic Samuel and Kings will have influenced the redrafting of some synoptic passages.
3 Isaiah and Hezekiah
We have just noted some examples of divergence within the tradition. As we pass to the second main section of our discussion, it is important to stress how exceptional such divergence is. Whether we are reviewing the presence or absence of the eight ‘indicators’ in synoptic texts, or whether we are reviewing their usage of stock ‘prophetic’ terminology, what compels attention is the stability of the textual evidence. After comparing the relevant portions of Samuel-Kings with Chronicles and comparing the several ancient witnesses to each, we may be confident that this older ‘prophetic’ narrative has been preserved almost completely unchanged in the available witnesses to the familiar biblical books.31 However, as we turn to the more extended narratives about Hezekiah and Isaiah, we enter a world of very different textual relationships.
3.1 Overview
The Hezekiah narratives in 2 Kgs 18–20 (together with the very similar alternative version in Isa. 36–39) and 2 Chron. 29–32 differ more from each other than those about any other king in Jerusalem since David and Solomon; and Isaiah ben Amoz does figure in both. Apart from the almost standard features of the outer framework,32 the two narratives are most readily compared and contrasted in 2 Kgs 18:17–20:19 and 2 Chron. 32:9–31. Our eight ‘non-partisan’ verbal indicators, taken together, offer a fresh perspective for such a comparison. Neither account uses
1(יש ) at all; they share the same temporal transition (3):
30 They are also linked in Deut. 17:19; Josh. 4:14; Eccl. 5:17, 19; 8:15 (cf. כל־ימי חייך in Gen. 3:14, 17; Deut. 4:9; 6:2; 16:3; Josh. 1:5; Ps. 128:5; כל־ימי חייה in Prov. 31:12; and מספר ימי חייהם in Eccl. 2:3). Other close links in Deuteronomy include 4:4, 10: 5:3; 30:20; 31:13, 27. 31 This remarkable degree of textual stability appears to tell against Person’s insistence (‘Prophets in the Deuteronomic History’) that the alternative instantiations of a shared tradition manifest in Samuel-Kings and Chronicles are typical of an oral world. 32 2 Kgs 18:1–3||2 Chron. 29:1–2 and 2 Kgs 20:20–21||2 Chron. 32:32–33.

2 Kgs 20:1a||2 Chron. 32:24a); and both use an ( בימים ההם חלה חזקיהו]עד[למות infinitive absolute (4) at the same stage in the argument (2 Kgs 18:30||2 Chron. 32:13). The Kings (and Isaiah) version uses all of the other five indicators (some repeatedly), but the Chronicles version none of them at all: no 2( הנה ), no נאם 5(יהוה ), no ‘weeping’ (6), no ‘life’ (7), and no 8( אך ). In short, and from this (limited?) perspective, the Chronicler’s account of Hezekiah, the Assyrians, and Isaiah, is entirely typical of the range of synoptic reports of kings and prophets reviewed earlier in this paper. By contrast, the much longer account in Kings (and Isaiah) includes several features of non-synoptic Samuel and Kings. As for other recurring members of the ‘prophetic’ family vocabulary already reviewed, neither שאל (‘ask’) nor דרש (‘enquire’) is used within either report.33 ‘Yahweh’s word’ ( דבר יהוה ) has been used synoptically in 2 Chron. 11:2||2 Kgs 12:22 and 18:4, 18||1 Kgs 22:5, 19 and appears often elsewhere in Chronicles. However, this common expression is absent from 2 Chron. 32, although it is used in 2 Kgs 20:4, 16, 19 (||Isa 38:4; 39:5, 8). And similarly ‘speak’ ( דבר ) has Yahweh as its subject in 2 Kgs 19:21; 20:9, but never in 2 Chron. 32. It is hard to see why no mention of Yahweh speaking or of Yahweh’s word – not to speak of the other features of synoptic prophetic stories faithfully preserved by the Chronicler – survived in 2 Chron. 32 if they were part of the Chronicler’s source. In terms of our neutral indicators, the crucial difference between these Hezekiah narratives is that ‘life’ and ‘living’ (7), while totally absent from 2 Chron. 32, are not just present in the Kings (and Isaiah) version but are actually a prominent element of the longer narrative they offer. As already noted (in 2.5 above), it is ‘living God’ that Sennacherib mocks (2 Kgs 19:4, 16), and it is the continuing life of Jerusalem’s king that is brought into question (20:1, 7). Then Chronicles uses ‘days’ (3) just once (32:26) in addition to the shared clause just noted (32:24); but it is used repeatedly in 2 Kgs 19:3, 25; 20:1, 5, 6, 8, 17, 19 (as also in 18:4 and 20:20 which lie outside the portion being compared). And
הנה
(2), used in only two of the other synoptic prophetic stories (1 Kgs 22:13, 23, 25; 2 Kgs 22:16, 20), is found in 2 Kgs 18:21; 19:7, 11, 35; 20:5, 17. However, the other very striking difference is that Isaiah is named only once within the shorter narrative of 2 Chron. 32, while he is named 10× in text shared by Kings and Isaiah34 and 3× more in Kings pluses.35
33 דרש is differently used in 2 Chron. 32:31 from its synoptic use in 1 Kgs 22:5, 7, 8||2 Chron. 18:4, 6, 7 and 2 Kgs 22:13, 18||2 Chron. 34:21, 26 – there of consulting Yahweh or a prophet, but here of interpreting a sign. 34 2 Kgs 19:2, 5, 6, 20; 20:1, 4, 7, 14, 16, 19||Isa. 37:2, 5, 6, 21; 38:1, 4, 21; 39:3, 5, 8. 35 2 Kgs 20:8, 9, 11.

3.2 Assyrian Embassy
Every example of these several features that are distinctive of the version in Kings (and Isaiah) of the Hezekiah and Isaiah story is concentrated in the second part (2 Kgs 19–20) of that longer story, with the sole exception of one instance of הנה in 2 Kgs 18:21. Therefore, it is appropriate to start our more detailed (synoptic) comparison within 2 Kgs 18, where such features are almost completely absent. 2 Kgs 18:17–37 is twice as long as 2 Chron. 32:9–19; but both discuss the same key question: is anyone able to ‘deliver’ ( הציל ) Jerusalem from the king of Assyria? In almost every verse, the shorter 2 Chron. 32:9–19 includes significant links with its parallel in Kings. No technical prophetic language is used.36 On the other hand, what the Assyrian embassy has to say functions as a sort of false prophecy. One function of the following tables is to illustrate the complexity of the apparently innocent phrase ‘its parallel’: expressions which are clearly related to each other often do not appear in these ‘parallel’ texts in the same relative order. Wido van Peursen and Eep Talstra nicely illustrate37 how much more difficult it is to present diagrammatically comparisons between the Hezekiah stories in Kings and Chronicles than those in Kings and Isaiah. The attention they draw to same words uttered by different persons in each version and shifts between narrated text and direct speech is also helpful; however, the alleged direction of these shifts is unrelated to the ‘computer-assisted analysis’.

36 H. Haag, in ‘La Campagne de Sennachérib contre Jérusalem en 701’, RB 58 (1951), 351, noted three links he called Deuteronomic between the narratives in Kings and Chronicles: allusion to the cultic reform of Hezekiah (2 Kgs 18:22||2 Chron. 32:12), suspicion of foreign gods made by human hand (19:18||32:19), and the formula 32:11 || 18:22 (יהוה אלהינו ) corresponding to the Deuteronomic formula יהוה אלהיך . His view was that the Chronicler had adhered rather faithfully to a story that had originated among the disciples of Isaiah – a story which was then elaborated more substantially in Kings. 37 ‘Computer-Assisted Analysis of Parallel Texts in the Bible.

The recent paper noted above39 documents the very high level of stability in the chronological markers attested in synoptic portions of Kings and Chronicles. The variation exhibited at the start of this report is all the more remarkable, given that the two versions will share בימים ההם at 2 Kgs 20:1||2 Chron. 32:24. ‘After this’ ( אחר זה ) in 2 Chron. 32:9, though apparently unremarkable, is never used elsewhere in HB.40 On the other side, 2 Kgs 18:13 opens with a precise dating formula: ‘In 14 year of king Hezekiah . . .’. ‘In x year of . . .’ (ל־ X בשנה ) is used in Jeremiah at beginning (1:2) and end (52:31), and in 39:2 (to report the beginning of the end of Jerusalem). It is also used in two significant introductions in the book of Ezekiel (1:1; 40:1), but is most prominent in Ezek. 26–33 (7×).41 This form of words is used only once synoptically (2 Kgs 23:23||2 Chron. 35:19): ‘In 18 year of king Josiah [. . . this Passover was achieved in Jerusalem]’; but is never found elsewhere in Chronicles. However, it is employed to mark certain key stages in the narrative told by Kings: 1 Kgs 6:1 (‘in 480 year of the exodus from Egypt . . . Solomon built the temple’); 2 Kgs 22:3 (‘in 18 year of king Josiah . . . the king sent to the temple’); and 25:27||Jer. 52:31 (‘in 37 year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah . . . Evil-Merodach . . . raised the head of Jehoiachin’). The first and last of these examples introduce substantial Kings pluses;42 and the second underlines that the renewal of the temple by Josiah belonged to the same year as a celebration of Passover without parallel since Israel’s early days in her land. Yet we should note that, when either Kings or Chronicles offers greater chronological precision than the other in a synoptic context, it is unwise to suppose that it was better informed historically.43 Greater detail is a feature of the longer Kings version. 2 Chron. 32:9, 16 talk simply of Sennacherib’s ‘servants’; but the longer Kings version details three officials on either side (18:17–18, 26, 37) – and two of Hezekiah’s three reappear in 19:2. Similarly, Kings details five cities taken previously by Assyria (18:34) – and adds three more in 19:12–13 when the five are mentioned again – while 2 Chron. 32 does not cite specific examples. Then, only the longer Kings-Isaiah version makes reference to Pharaoh and Egypt. From the perspective of the shorter synoptic narrative, the expansive author of Kings was neatly achieving (at least) two exegetical goals by creating this date. At a more local level,

43 Only Kings specifies that, out of Solomon’s 20 years of construction, 7 were spent on temple and 13 on palace (1 Kgs 7:1); and only 2 Chron. 16 specifies the years of the fighting between Asa and Baasha.

he was aligning Hezekiah still more closely with synoptic Amaziah (also king for 29 years), who lived for 15 years after the campaign against his capital by the king of Israel (2 Kgs 14:17||2 Chron. 25:25). More grandly and by deliberate use of the unusual dating formula, he was setting the deliverance of both city and king within a historical arc from the completion of Solomon’s temple in Jerusalem through Josiah’s concern with that temple and his passover reform to a fresh status for exiled Jehoiachin. While sympathetic to Bob Becking’s ‘basic assumption . . . that the numbers for the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah in the Book of Kings are not to be assessed as a deliberate and meaningful “invention” by the redactors of the Book’,44 I would limit the scope of such a claim to the narrative as shared by Kings and Chronicles.

The second and third sections of the two narratives are even less commensurate than 2 Kgs 18:17–37 and 2 Chron. 32:9–19. The few elements they do share are readily listed.

There is neither ‘asking’ ( שאל ) nor ‘enquiry’ ( דרש ) in either version of the Hezekiah story; but the king communicates with the deity by ‘praying’ ( התפלל ) – a term which has not been met in synoptic texts since David and Solomon.45 He prays first about the situation of his city and people (2 Kgs 19||2 Chron. 32:20–23), and then about his own mortal sickness (2 Kgs 20:1–11||2 Chron. 32:24–26). A divine emissary ( מלאך ), not encountered synoptically since the story of David’s census (2 Sam. 24:16–17), causes the departure of the Assyrian army (2 Kgs 19:35||2 Chron. 32:21). Jerusalem had been saved on that earlier occasion too, though the messenger’s role was destructive of many of David’s people. However, perhaps the most striking result of this synoptic comparison is a negative one: that Isaiah, though named once in 2 Chron. 32 alongside Hezekiah, is not reported as interacting with the king. 2 Chron. 32:20 states simply ‘And Hezekiah the king prayed – and Isaiah ben Amoz the prophet – about this.’ In addressing Yahweh directly in prayer, the Chronicler’s King Hezekiah stands in royal continuity with synoptic David and Solomon. And Isaiah, far from being the instigator of his king’s approach to the deity or even an intermediary between the two, appears here to be an afterthought. The overview early in this paper of what the title called ‘the oldest “biblical” prophetic narrative’ occasioned surprise that there is no prophetic role in the momentous story of Athaliah and Joash. If Isaiah ben Amoz was not after all an original element of the synoptic Hezekiah story, that earlier ‘lack’ may be less surprising than first appeared. The situation is very different in the fuller Kings/Isaiah version of Hezekiah. There the king does finally (2 Kgs 19:15) pray to Yahweh in response to advice offered by Isaiah many verses earlier (2 Kgs 19:4). It was noted above that the most obvious links in 2 Kgs 18:17–37||Isa. 36 to the rest of the book of Isaiah are not shared with 2 Chron. 32:9–19. It is arguable that an earlier draft of the story of Hezekiah and Sennacherib within the synoptic royal narrative made no mention of Isaiah, and that an older shorter draft without Isaiah was expanded in one direction in Chronicles and much more fully in another direction in Kings/Isaiah.46 In his discussion of Isaiah and the Assyrian Crisis, B.S. Childs was of the view that the Chronicler had produced a ‘midrash’ of the Kings/Isaiah narrative: ‘product of an exegetical activity by a circle of scholars in interpreting
45 2 Sam. 7:27; 1 Kgs 8 (9×). 46 The minimal presence of the prophet casts grave doubt on Haag’s view (see n. 36 above) that the Chronicler had adhered rather faithfully to a story that had originated among the disciples of Isaiah – a story which was then elaborated more substantially in Kings.

an ancient text’.47 However, in light of the analysis above, it seems even more likely that the longer version of the story in Kings, with its several additions drawing on other portions of Samuel-Kings, should be described as ‘midrashic’ development of the shorter base text that had been available to the Chronicler.
4 Outlook
One element of the Chronicler’s version of the Hezekiah story has an interesting parallel in the peroration in Kings on the fall of northern Israel. As noted above, the key verb ‘deliver’ ( הציל ), used many times in both versions of the Hezekiah story, is found just once more in Kings: immediately beforehand (2 Kgs 17:39), close to the end of the long peroration. Similarly ‘trust in’ ( האמין ) of 2 Chron. 32:15 is used in Kings only in 2 Kgs 17:14; and each of הציל and האמין is closely associated in 2 Kgs 17 with ‘but they did not listen’ ( 48.)ולא שמעו These indicators invite the suggestion that האמין , a significant element of Isa. 7:9 and 28:16 now attested only in the Chronicler’s version (2 Chron. 32:15), had been original to the Hezekiah story but was overwritten by the synonymous בטח , when that verb became much more prominently used in the Kings/Isaiah version.49 There is little space here to develop the implications this paper may have for other issues. But one can at least be mentioned. The underlying Hezekiah narrative had been integral to the Jerusalem royal story. But were the origins of the shared longer narrative more at home in Kings or Isaiah? The question of the relative priority of our inherited texts of 2 Kgs 18–20 and Isa. 36–39 is a different one, although there are overlaps. For example, the fact that the Kings version is generally more expansive may properly influence the literaryhistorical decision on whether 2 Kgs 18:14–16 was a later addition to Kings or was deleted when the Hezekiah narrative was incorporated within Isaiah. R.F. Person, Jr has proposed that these verses were added for the purpose of ‘downplaying Hezekiah as a model king’50 – I think sensibly, despite the

Childs, Isaiah and the Assyrian (Studies in Biblical Theology 3), London 1967, 107. 48 ולא שמעו may itself have been drawn from synoptic 2 Kgs 21:9; but where this clause is found in synoptic contexts in Kings (2 Kgs 21:9; 22:13), Chronicles uses a different verb: הקשיבו (2 Chron. 33:10) and 34:21 ( שמרו ). 49 Though used only once in 2 Chron. 32 (v. 10), בטח qal appears 7× in the Kgs/Isa. parallel (2 Kgs 18:19, 20, 21, 21, 22, 24; 19:10) in addition to 2 Kgs 18:5.

dismissal as ‘arbitrary’ by N. Naʾaman.51 He himself retains the view that vv. 14–16 were omitted from Isa. 36 for the opposite reason: towards ‘the idealization of the figure of Hezekiah in exilic and postexilic periods’.52 Naʾaman’s primary concern is to differentiate 2 Kgs 19:9b-35 (the so-called source B2) from its context in 18:13–19:9a, 19:36–37 (B1) and to date the later material. His comparison and contrast of the lists of captured cities and peoples in 18:33–34 and 19:12–13, with their implications for (up)dating, are persuasive. Less persuasive is retaining the model of an earlier and a later ‘source’ at all, instead of using the same evidence towards alternative models such as expansive rewriting (‘rolling corpus’ or Fortschreibung). In these more organic models, the newer material has to be understood within the context of the older rather than as distinct from it and over against it. An important exegetical consequence of such a choice is the assessment of the relation of king and prophet in the later material. The location by the Fuller’s Field (2 Kgs 18:17b) is known elsewhere only in Isaiah (7:3);
18:21 ( משענת הקנה הרצוץ הזה ) resonates with Isa. 3:1; 10:20; 30:12; has a parallel only in Isa. 9:6. But ) 19:31 ( קנאת יהוה צבאות תעשה זאת and ; 31:1 there are also clear echoes of several portions of (Samuel and) Kings, some of them synoptic. a. The earlier, shorter Hezekiah narrative had been rewritten by drawing on the synoptic Josiah/Huldah narrative, with Isaiah developing the role played earlier by Huldah.53 b. The naming of emissaries in the synoptic account of Josiah and Huldah is not only reflected in the named messengers sent by Hezekiah to Isaiah (2 Kgs 19:2), but may also underlie the addition of named representatives of both Sennacherib and Hezekiah as the narrative in 2 Kgs 18 was expanded. c. The visit of the embassy from Babylon at the end of the tale (2 Kgs 20:12–19) was drafted with conscious reference to the visit of the Queen of Sheba in the synoptic Solomon story (1 Kgs 10:1–10).

52 Although these verses are apparently realistic, the coincidence of קצץ in both 2 Kgs 18:16 and synoptic 2 Kgs 16:17||2 Chron. 28:24 and of קצץ together with היכל יהוה in both 2 Kgs 18:16 and 24:13 may (like the introductory date) point us towards exegesis and away from archive. 53 In his great grief (2 Kgs 20:3), Hezekiah anticipates and also outdoes Josiah (22:19), the only synoptic character who weeps (indicator 6). The sole occurrence of 5(נאם יהוה ) in this longer version of the Hezekiah story, spoken by Isaiah (19:33) just a few verses before the king’s great weeping, is also unique to 22:19 within the synoptic texts. Similarly, two of the instances of 2( הנה ), key elements of the synoptic Huldah story (22:16, 20), are used in the same broad context (19:35; 20:5).

synoptic links with Samuel-Kings inserted by this expansive rewriter include the request made by Hezekiah to Isaiah for healing (literally ‘life’) from illness, like those made by king Amaziah to Elijah in 2 Kgs 1 and the king of Damascus to Elisha in 2 Kgs 8; and elements from the critique of Eli by an unnamed ‘man of God’ in 1 Sam. 2:27–36.54 One of these shared elements, הנה ימים באים (1 Sam. 2:31; 2 Kgs 20:17||Isa. 39:6), is also found some dozen times in Jeremiah.55 And the return of Hezekiah’s envoys (2 Kgs 18:37) with rent clothes ( קרעי בגדים ) recalls 1 Sam. 4:12; 2 Sam. 1:2; 13:31; 15:32; and, outside Samuel, Jer. 41:5.
54 These include (1) כה אמר יהוה (1 Sam. 2:27) used in 2 Kgs 19:6, 32; 20:1, 5; (2) 2:30 (נאם יהוה ) וזה־לך האות )5( in 20:17; and ) 2:31 ( הנה ימים באים )4(; in 20:3 ) 2:30, 35 ( התהלך )3(; in 19:33 (2:34) in 19:29; 20:9. 55 This link between prophetic words near beginning and end of Samuel-Kings and in the book of Jeremiah is analogous to the ‘tingling ears’ triangle in 1 Sam. 3:11; 2 Kgs 21:12; Jer. 19:3. See A.G. Auld, ‘Jeremiah – Manasseh – Samuel. Significant Triangle? Or Vicious Circle’, in: H.M. Barstad and R.G. Kratz (eds), Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah (BZAW 388), Berlin 2009, 1–9. Here in fact ‘triangle’ is not quite accurate: הנה ימים באים is found in Amos 4:2; 8:11; 9:13 as well as Jer. 7:32; 9:24; 16:14; 19:6; 23:5, 7; 31:27, 31, 38; 33:14(M+); 48:12; 49:2; 51:52. The two relationships overlap in Jer. 19:3, 6; and adjacent Jer. 19:7 provides a unique parallel to the pairing of והפלתיו בחרב in 2 Kgs 19:7.

Prophets, Kings and Honour in the Narrative of 1 Kgs 22*
William L. Kelly
Cultures that depend on prophets and diviners to access the divine will are very familiar with the threat of charlatanism and the social conflicts between rivals. Ancient Israel was no exception, and these problems reared their heads at times in the texts of the Hebrew Bible. The famous narrative of 1 Kgs 22:1–38 is a key text for this theme, with its differing messages given by prophets to the kings of Israel and Judah, and this paper explores the text in a socio-historical perspective.1 The dynamics of prophetic conflict and the trustworthiness of prophetic speech, as it concerns this particular narrative, were conditioned by the values, status, and power of the characters involved. In this study, after briefly summarising the narrative’s setting and plot, three particular points of the story will attract particular focus: the kings’ consultation of prophets prior to battle (1 Kgs 22:2–9), the public delivery of prophetic oracles (22:10–12, 15–18), and the prophets’ attempt at discrediting their rivals (22:19–23, 24–25). We will examine issues related to the cultural value of honour, the social mechanisms which distribute it and the status it confers.
1 Overview of 1 Kgs 22
The story in 1 Kgs 22:1–38 opens with the royal preliminaries to battle and the consultation of prophets before attempting to regain control of Ramoth-gilead

in the Transjordan. The activities of the prophets tend to dominate interest in the passage, but the central figure nevertheless remains Ahab.2 He is named only in 1 Kgs 22:20 and 22:39–55, while the rest of the narrative simply refers to him as the מלך ישראל .3 However, the text is situated in the context of his reign, which is introduced in 1 Kgs 16:21–33 and concluded in 22:29–40. This unit comprises nearly a quarter of the books of Kings and demonstrates Ahab’s particular significance to the story. The story begins with a visit from the southern monarch Jehoshaphat of Judah. We are not informed about Jehoshaphat’s reasons for visiting the northern kingdom but his presence would presumably be at Ahab’s behest, his kingdom being the stronger of the two at this particular time. Ahab believes he has rightful ownership of a contested border city (cf. Deut 4:43; Josh 20:8; 21:38; 1 Kgs 4:13) and begins a process of gathering strength in advance of a military campaign. After Jehoshaphat pledges his allegiance to Ahab and commits troops to his cause (1 Kgs 22:4), the narrative then takes a long detour in detailing the process by which they seek to divine the will of Yahweh regarding this affair. Prophetic activity then unfolds in four episodic parts. First, a cohort of prophets are asked a yes-or-no question as to whether the battle should proceed (1 Kgs 22:2–9). Their answer is unanimous in the affirmative:

Nelson, First and Second Kings, Louisville 1987, 151. 3 Identifying the king of this story as Ahab is admittedly problematic, and forms of this text may have originated from the reign of Jehu. We know from Assyrian royal inscriptions that a coalition of kings in the west, led by Adad-iri of Aram-Damascus and Irḫuleni of Hamath, resisted Shalmaneser III in 853 BCE during the 6th year of the latter’s reign (A.0.102.6 ii 26–29; A.0.102.8 15′-17′). Also in this coalition was an Israelite army led by Ahab of Israel (A.0.102.2 ii 91–92). Shalmaneser III later claims victory over the coalition and records tribute received from Jehu (A.0.102.12 29–31). Why would Israel and Aram form an alliance in 853 BCE, break this agreement and fight against each other, only to then re-ally against Assyria in 841 BCE? A.K.

22:6 ( אדני ביד המלך ). For reasons unsaid the kings seek out a second opinion and summon Micaiah ben Imlah, the prophet whose reputation suggests he will dissent from the chorus of other prophetic voices. This leads to a second scene rich with detail about the royal court and the positive words given by the prophets (22:10–12). In the third part Micaiah takes centre stage, initially agreeing with the other prophets (22:15) before delivering an anticipated word of doom (22:16–18) along with a vision report of the divine council (22:19–23). Finally, one of the prophets from the group of yea-sayers confronts Micaiah and strikes him, sparking a terse exchange between the two (22:24–25). The narrative continues with Ahab jailing Micaiah, and the two kings proceeding unabated with Ahab’s plan. The negative oracle apparently discouraged Ahab enough to make him disguise himself before the battle, allowing Jehoshaphat to receive the attention of the Aramaeans during the fighting (1 Kgs 22:30–33). The denouement arrives with a stray arrow striking the disguised Ahab, subsequently causing him to bleed to death (22:34–38). Social factors inherent in the process of prophetic consultation are clearly guiding a good deal of this narrative and how its characters are evaluated. When the two kings express a desire to receive supportive oracles before war, or when prophetic messages become public performances, we see such evaluation at work. Anthropologists working with cultures of the Mediterranean4 have discussed this valuation in terms of honour, which is ‘a sign of the recognition of the excellence or worth of a person’ or, essentially, a right to respect.5
4 The notion of a cultural ‘Mediterranean’ unified by generalised social values of honour and shame is a point of great debate; Herzfeld named this tendency the ‘sin of “Mediterraneanism”.’ M.

Precisely defining the term is difficult, and a great deal of effort in anthropological literature ‘has been expended, not entirely fruitfully, on the questions of what honour is’, see P. Horden, N. Purcell, The Corrupting Sea, 502. Although a bit dated, classic works in the field are still considered valuable sources of information since they document people groups

By such a definition, honour is a public value gained by the successful performance of one’s social role. When individuals have a public role to play, and their society relies on them to perform their role well, the society has to know that such individuals will perform well when called upon. It is incredibly valuable for a society to know who is dependable and who is not. This knowledge translates into a kind of trust which is given to those dependable individuals, and it elevates their social role and voice. This is essentially how honour works in the public sphere. In settings of social conflict honour functions as ‘a mechanism which distributes power’.6 When these social conflicts involve individuals in the public sphere, honour is exchanged like a kind of social currency. Bourdieu’s dialectic of ‘challenge and riposte’ suggests that the stakes of social conflicts are paid in honour, which reinforces or advances a person’s status.7 As it will be shown, these social mechanisms are at play in 1 Kgs 22:1–38 as the social status of characters function as hinges upon which the story turns.
2 Consulting Prophets prior to Battle (1 Kgs 22:2–9)
The stage is set for the delivery of prophetic oracles in 1 Kgs 22:5 when Jehoshaphat suggests that the kings should first inquire of Yahweh (

his wish to go to battle, the argument goes, while Jehoshaphat is humbly deferential to the will of Yahweh. It seems this view follows too closely with the bias of the larger narrative frame which is baldly critical of Ahab, and glosses over aspects of Jehoshaphat’s behaviour which invite criticism. Jehoshaphat, ‘regardless of motivation’, proclaims his loyalty to Ahab prior to his suggestion to consult Yahweh; this fact is part of the Chronicler’s later criticism of Jehoshaphat.9 Furthermore, even if one wants to highlight his piety in 1 Kgs 22:5, Jehoshaphat ultimately disregards Micaiah’s negative oracle and follows Ahab to battle.10 In any case, consulting the divine will in times of crisis is ‘a routine event in the political life of an ancient people’,11 something which is also well attested in the biblical record.12 Ahab is certainly engaged in a series of actions which validate and justify his royal power and rule, and there are many examples of kings following the same pattern of behaviour.

Adad not to go on a campaign without an oracle,13 and the Zakkur inscription depicts Bar Hadad II praying to Baal Šamen to receive reassurance that he will fend off his enemies.14 Many kings credit an initial divine imperative for their military victories. Mesha of Moab claims a divine imperative for his military victories which provide a positive valuation of his rule.15 Neo-Assyrian texts record encouraging oracles delivered to Esarhaddon prior to and during the civil war of 681 BCE,16 and other kings, including Tiglath-pileser I and Ashurnasirpal II, cite divine commands for their military campaigns.17 In these and similar instances the respective king gains a positive evaluation through these successes aided by the gods.18 Is Ahab asking a question to the prophets on an already settled matter?19 Given how standard this practice was in the cultures of the ancient Near East, it seems not. This question is simply a part of establishing just cause for war in order to marshall divine and public support.20 The overwhelmingly

positive response of the prophets in 1 Kgs 22:6 illustrates their role in legitimising the rule of the king and in demonstrating continuity between heavenly and earthly rule. Jehoshaphat, however, asks if another prophet is available for consultation. Is it suspicion, caution or piety that prompts him? The narrative is silent on the matter, but perhaps the unanimously supportive message of the prophets prompts a desire for another perspective. By way of comparison, AEM 1/1 199 (A.925 + A.2050) records an instance where Zimri-Lim asks for a second prophetic opinion, apparently out of pragmatic caution against overconfidence. Thus piety might not be the impetus for Jehoshaphat’s actions here either.
3 Public Delivery of Prophetic Oracles (1 Kgs 22:10–12, 15–18)
After Jehoshaphat’s request for a second opinion, the narrative provides a more detailed look at the scene where the supportive prophets deliver their oracles. The setting is a public gathering at the city gate where the prophets prophesy before the two kings who are seated on thrones and clothed in royal robes.21 The setting and the royal accoutrements heighten and emphasise the power and authority of the kings as they preside like judges over a court and receive public council on their war plans.22

Job 29:7–17; Ruth 4:1–12); see Barstad, ‘Sic dicit dominus’, 44. Conversely, it is debated whether or not prophets did in fact address the king in public. D.

The prophets then gather before the kings and deliver Yahwistic oracles in support of the war effort just as their social role demands.23 The message of the prophets in 1 Kgs 22:10 varies in form from the earlier report of 22:6, but the oracles are consistent in content. One prophet named Zedekiah ben Chanaanah furnishes himself with a set of iron horns ( קרני ברזל ) presumably to demonstrate his message of support before the assembly. He possibly uses these horns in a prophetic sign-act to visualise his proclamation of victory.24 Publicly performed sign-acts add legitimacy to both the oracle and the prophet; they confer honour upon the performer, and increase the persuasiveness of the prophetic message.25 In 1 Kgs 22:11, Zedekiah also uses the prophetic speech formula כה אמר יהוה , which is found throughout the Hebrew Bible, and his oracle borrows Deuteronomic and prophetic imagery (Deut. 33:17; Mic. 4:13). All of these features of Zedekiah’s portrayal in this part of the narrative reinforce his credibility, power, status and authority.26 Before Micaiah ben Imlah enters the scene, the narrative casts him as an antagonist of the king with a reputation for never bringing good news (1 Kgs 22:8). Ahab is familiar with Micaiah and hates his persistent tendency to speak misfortune ( רע ). Therefore, he stands in contrast to the supportive prophets of 1 Kgs 22:10 before he even gives his message. While this is clearly
23 AEM 1/1 216 (A.2209) gives evidence of a similar setting of prophets gathered together for consultation as a group in Mari; see Barstad, ‘Sic dicit dominus’, 40. 24 Some scholars draw upon iconographic evidence to explain the significance of Zedekiah’s horns, or more generally comment on the link between horns and the positive representation of royal power O.

part of a literary strategy to portray him as a heroic and critical outsider to the story’s proceedings, it also seems that Micaiah is no stranger to the royal court.27 The narrative plot reaches a twist when Micaiah defies his reputation and repeats the oracle of the positive prophets nearly verbatim. Perhaps with some irony, Micaiah’s positive word arouses the king’s concern, and Ahab responds by commanding him to speak רק־אמת בשם יהוה in 1 Kgs 22:16. What is the truth in this context? Following a socio-historical reading, Ahab’s demand is for Micaiah to speak loyally or reliably,28 and Ahab’s concern with אמת is the threat posed by messages which would undermine his rule.29 In this context, it appears that Ahab might not desire to set a precedent where a prophet can stand in a public assembly and misrepresent his or her view of the divine will. Ultimately Ahab was right to suspect that there was more to Micaiah’s message, as the prophet gives a negative oracle in response to the original question (1 Kgs 22:17; cf. 22:6).30
27 Attempts to distinguish strongly between Micaiah and the ‘professional diviners’ is misguided; the two are engaged in the same prophetic process. Cf. D.L.

One clear example is AEM 1/1 237 (A.994), which records a prophetic message to Zimri-Lim discouraging him from going to battle. Micaiah’s negative word to Ahab is of a closely similar kind.

4 Prophets Discrediting their Rivals (1 Kgs 22:19–23, 24–25)
Micaiah delivers a second oracle in 1 Kgs 22:19–23 in the form of a vision of the divine council of Yahweh.31 This heavenly setting is the space where the deliberations, plans and judgments of Yahweh are decreed and subsequently revealed to those privileged enough to either see, hear or participate in the proceedings. Access to this heavenly space was an assumed part of the office of a prophet,32 and such access confers a degree of status and authorisation to those fortunate enough to be there.33 Another way of legitimising prophetic speech is by claiming to participate in this communicative chain. In his vision report, Micaiah reasserts his negative oracle with the claim that Yahweh enticed (√
פחה ) Ahab by sending a רוח שקר in the mouths of the prophets (1 Kgs 22:21–22).34 These prophets delivered their oracles ‘in good

conscience, for Yahweh – but Yahweh had deceived them’35 since they were not made aware of the plans of the divine council. In this way, Micaiah does not reject the supportive prophets tout court like severe passages from Jeremiah or Zephaniah. Instead he criticises their ability to know the will of Yahweh, and this is a clear attempt to undermine their status as rivals. If their source of inspiration is misleading, then the credibility and usefulness of their oracles is compromised.36 Conversely, discrediting one’s rivals can reinforce one’s own authority, and Micaiah stands to benefit from the loss of honour and status suffered by the untrustworthy prophets. Their loss is his gain.37 The vision also catches Ahab in a double bind. If he trusts Micaiah and abstains from his military campaign, he is implicitly acknowledging that he, Zedekiah and the court prophets were all misled. But if he persists and marches upon Ramoth-gilead, then the
רוח שקר did in fact succeed in enticing him to go to war as Yahweh intended (1 Kgs 22:19).38 Zedekiah takes the opportunity to respond to Micaiah in 1 Kgs 22:24 in this critical moment where social rank and status are at stake.39 The interaction between the two prophets is clearly adversarial and contentious. Striking Micaiah on the cheek, Zedekiah questions how he knows about the movement of the spirit of Yahweh between the two prophets. Micaiah retorts by telling Zedekiah that he will understand when he hides (√ חבה ) in his inner-room (cf. 1 Kgs 20:30; 2 Kgs 9:2), a threat which hints at the experience of some kind

of duress.40 While these interactions are somewhat opaque, they clearly demonstrate an interest in the connection between the prophet and his message. The ad hominem critiques and attacks from each prophet are intended to undermine the status of the opponent by casting doubt on his abilities and his source of prophetic inspiration.
5 Conclusion
Key elements of the narrative of 1 Kgs 22:1–38 demonstrate a clear interest in issues related to social standing and honour in a setting of prophetic conflict. Consulting prophets prior to battle is an expected part of the process by which kings seek positive evaluations of their rule and justification for their military actions (22:2–9). A public setting where prophetic oracles are delivered allows the opportunity for prophets to demonstrate their ability and prowess (22:1012, 15–18). It also gives prophetic figures the opportunity to advance their social position by discrediting their rivals (22:19–23, 24–25). The royal consultation of prophets, the public delivery of prophetic oracles, and inter-prophetic conflict, all hinge upon the social standing of the relevant parties involved. Assessing the narrative of 1 Kgs 22:1–38 in a socio-historical perspective involves analysing contextually implicit social values and indications of social status, power and prestige. These elements of the story suggest that the prophets had to earn trust in ancient Israelite society, which faced some difficult decisions when seeking Yahweh’s will.

Text and History of Isaiah 20: Its Development within the Isaianic Tradition
Reinoud Oosting
1 Introduction
In the current composition of Isaiah, the account about the prophet Isaiah in chapter 20 is part of the oracles against the foreign nations (chapters 13–23). The passage distinguishes itself from the surrounding chapters not only by the narrative style in which the account is written but also by its chronological heading. While in Isaiah 13–23 we frequently meet the superscription מַ שָּ ֺא (‘the oracle concerning’) followed by a reference to a nation1 or a location,2 the heading of Isaiah 20 contains a historical reference to the Assyrian military campaign against Ashdod. Despite the differences between Isaiah 20 and the bulk of the material in Isaiah 13–23, its current position in the collection of oracles against the nations can easily be explained. Isaiah 20 is linked to the oracles against Ethiopia and Egypt in Isaiah 18–19 by the references to Egypt and Ethiopia in vv. 3–5. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the highway from Egypt to Assyria mentioned in Isa. 19:23 is the same route that the Assyrians in Isaiah 20 take to march against Ashdod and then use to lead the people of Egypt and Ethiopia away as exiles. Though the narrative in chapter 20 fits the current context, the question remains of how this passage became part of the Isaianic tradition. How did this account enter the literary history of the Book of Isaiah? In answering that question, current researchers usually concentrate on historical references and redactional layers within Isaiah 1–39. Their studies offer a wealth of information about the cultural and historical background of the narrative, but pay less attention to the linguistic and literary signals within the text itself. In order to gain insight into the development of Isaiah 20, the present paper focuses on textual data rather than on historical processes and redactional history. The linguistic and literary data of the text of the Hebrew Bible in its current form are used as an independent source of research. The starting point for the examination is the text of Isaiah 20 in its final form. The linguistic and literary

Text and History of Isaiah 20 77
features of this passage will be analyzed first and then its relationship to other biblical texts and extra-biblical sources. In giving priority to textual evidence, this paper seeks to gain insight into the development of Isaiah 20 within the Isaianic tradition.
2 Historicity of Isaiah 20
The short narrative about the prophet Isaiah in chapter 20 contains clear historical references. Isaiah 20 is the only passage in the Hebrew Bible in which the Assyrian King Sargon II (722–705 BCE) is explicitly mentioned. Furthermore, this chapter refers to the military campaign of King Sargon against Ashdod. Assyrian inscriptions indicate that Azuri, the king of Ashdod, refused to pay any more tribute and sent messages to the kings of the surrounding countries to rebel against the King of Assyria. On account of that, the Assyrians replaced Azuri by his younger brother Ahimiti. When the Assyrians had turned their back, however, the people of Ashdod deposed Ahimiti and made Yamani ruler over them. In response to that rebellious act, the Assyrian king Sargon marched against the city of Ashdod and conquered it.3 It is widely accepted that the beginning of Isaiah 20 refers to Sargon’s campaign against Ashdod. At the same time, it is not entirely clear whether all details of the biblical account are accurate. Isaiah 20 recounts Sargon sending his commander-in-chief, the Tartan, to lead the military campaign against Ashdod. In the Assyrian inscriptions, however, Sargon claims that he himself besieged and conquered Ashdod. Furthermore, it appears that, although Egypt and Ethiopia are explicitly mentioned in this passage, they were not involved in the rebellion of Ashdod against Assyria. On the contrary, when the leader of the rebellion, Yamani, fled to Egypt, the Egyptians handed him over to the Assyrians. These observations suggest that the text and the historicity of Isaiah 20 are not fully in line with each other. One gets the impression that the account in Isaiah 20 is not historically accurate. It is worth exploring, therefore, how current exegetes deal with the discrepancy between the text and historicity of Isaiah 20.
3 The Assyrian accounts concerning the conquest of Ashdod have been confirmed by the finding of three fragments of an Assyrian stele at Tell Ashdod, which contain several lines of texts that have parallels in other texts of King Sargon II, cf. Z.J. Kapera, ‘The Ashdod Stele of Sargon II’, Folia Orientalia 17 (1976), 87–99.

3 Current Approaches to Isaiah 20
In current exegetical literature, one encounters different answers to the question concerning the relationship between the text and historicity of this passage. The first answer to be mentioned is the traditional view of John Oswalt, who maintains that Isaiah 20 is a historical narrative about the prophet Isaiah. Like the other narratives in chapters 6–8, 22, and 36–39, it has been written by the prophet Isaiah himself or by someone close to him. Oswalt explains the discrepancy between the text and historicity of Isaiah 20 by emphasizing the ‘diversity and complexity of the prophetic writings’.4 With regard to Isaiah 20, Oswalt asserts that Ashdod’s fate was not the major issue in Isaiah 20. ‘The real issue was the fate of Egypt, fomenter of the rebellion.’5 The second answer is the one given by Csaba Balogh in his reworked doctoral dissertation on Isaiah 18–20. Balogh holds to the unity of this passage. He asserts that ‘this narrative has only ever existed in the final form that it now has.’6 Unlike Oswalt, Balogh does not regard this passage as a historically reliable account. He explains the discrepancy between the text and history of Isaiah 20 by assuming that the narrative in Isaiah 20 is not contemporary with the events it narrates but originated at a later time. In his view, Isaiah 20 was most likely written in the final years of the kingdom of Judah.7 The third answer that requires attention is the view of Ronald Clements, who focuses on the discrepancies within the text. According to Clements, an older oracle of Isaiah (against the Philistines) has been edited. Clements leaves open the question as to whether the narrative in the third person was originally formulated by the prophet in the first person.8 His main conclusion is that discrepancies are best explained by assuming that an older text has been reworked by a later editor, who lived shortly before the siege of Jerusalem in 701 BCE. The last answer to be discussed here is the interpretation of Joseph Blenkinsopp. He suggests that Isaiah 20 is not part of the Isaianic core of the Book of Isaiah but has a ‘Deuteronomistic origin’. In his view, Isaiah 20 has ‘either been excerpted from Dtr [the Deuteronomistic History] by an editor . . .

6 Cf. C. Balogh, The Stele of YHWH in Egypt: The Prophecies of Isaiah 18–20 concerning Egypt and Kush (OTS 60), Leiden 2011, 319. 7 Cf. Balogh, Stele of YHWH in Egypt, 330: ‘A third and most likely option is to place the composition of Isa. 20 in the final years of the kingdom of Judah.’ 8 Cf. R.E. Clements, Isaiah 1–39 (NCBC), Grand Rapids 1980, 174.



Text and History of Isaiah 20 79
or that, together with chs. 7 and 36–39, it is part of a Deuteronomistic redaction of chs. 1–39’.9 Blenkinsopp thus explains the discrepancy between text and historicity by assuming that chapter 20 has been written from a Deuteronomistic perspective.
4 A Data-Oriented Approach
These observations show that current exegetes deal with the discrepancy between the text and historicity of Isaiah 20 in different ways. Oswalt simply denies the ambiguities between the biblical account and the extra-biblical account. In his view, it is neither necessary to question the historicity of the biblical account, nor its literary unity. Others, like Clements, hold to the historical reliability of Isaiah 20, but they question the literary unity of the passage. According to Clements, the discrepancies are best explained by assuming that the original oracle has been edited. Balogh and Blenkinsopp, on the other hand, hold to the literary unity of the Isaiah 20, but they cast doubt on the historical reliability of the account. They believe that Isaiah 20 is a colored version of the fall of Ashdod written from a later perspective. Apart from the traditional view, exegetes thus tend to explain the discrepancy between the text and historicity of Isaiah 20 in two different ways: Either they question the literary unity of the passage (Clements) or they question the historical reliability of the account (Balogh, Blenkinsopp). In my view, both the unity and the reliability of Isaiah 20 should be called into question. Because we merely have the text of Isaiah 20 in its present form, we cannot exclude the possibility that this text has been reworked in the course of time. In addition, Isaiah 20 has been transmitted in the course of time as part of the Book of Isaiah. We cannot exclude the possibility that later editors adapted the existing account with a view to its position in the Isaianic tradition. For those reasons, both the unity and the reliability of Isaiah 20 will be examined here. As a starting-point for the examination, this paper looks first at the linguistic and syntactic features of the text of Isaiah 20 as it now stands. Then we draw attention to the literary parallels between Isaiah 20 and other parts of Isaiah 1–39. Next the relationship between Isaiah 20 and other biblical books, especially 2 Kings, is scrutinized. Finally, we examine the relationship between

the account of the fall of Ashdod in Isaiah 20 and the references to the Assyrian military campaign against Ashdod in extra-biblical sources. In choosing this order, the present paper gives priority to the analysis of textual data over the examination of the cultural and historical context of this passage. In doing so, it aims to shed new light on the discrepancy between the text and historicity of Isaiah 20.
5 Linguistic Observations
In examining the linguistic and syntactic features of Isaiah 20 in its current form, we concentrate on the first two verses of this passage, which read:
In the year that the Tartan who was sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against Ashdod and captured it; [2] at that time Yhwh spoke through (literally, בְּ יַ ד ) Isaiah son of Amoz, saying . . .10
In these two verses we encounter two doublets. First, there are two time references: the phrase בִּ שְ נַ ת ‘in the year that’, at the beginning of v. 1 and the phrase ׇבּעֵ ת ׇה ִהיא , ‘at that time’, at the beginning of v. 2. Furthermore, the name of Ashdod is used twice, the second reference almost immediately after the first, which is rather unusual. When the capture of a city is described, the name of the city is usually mentioned once, and then it is referred to by means of pronominal suffixes (cf. Josh. 10:36–37; 19:47; 2 Kgs 12:18; 18:9–10). These two doublets – marked below – suggest that the current text of Isa. 20:1–2 is a revised edition of an older text.
In the year that the Tartan who was sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against Ashdod and captured it; [2] at that time Yhwh spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying . . .
That conclusion is supported by the syntactic constructions found in Isa. 6:1 and 14:28. In both cases a subordinated clause, which begins with the temporal phrase
בִּ שְ נַ ת , ‘in the year that’, is immediately followed by the main clause, which serves as introduction to the remainder of the passage:
Isa. 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw Yhwh sitting on a throne . . .
10 Isa. 20:1–2.



Text and History of Isaiah 20 81
Isa. 14:28 In the year that King Ahaz died, this oracle came:
The suggestion that the first two verses of Isaiah 20 have been reworked is not new. In his study on the earliest stages of the Isaiah tradition, Matthijs de Jong brings forward comparable arguments.11 In addition, he points out that the combination of the verbs לחם Niphal (‘to fight’) and לכד Qal (‘to capture’) at the end of v. 1 is ‘a common way to describe a successful siege of a city’.12 For that reason, he considers the last part of v. 1 to be a secondary addition. On that basis, De Jong comes to the conclusion that an older text of vv. 1–2 probably was:
In the year that the Tartan who was sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against Ashdod and captured it; [2] at that time Yhwh spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying . . .
Though I largely agree with the above reconstruction, I would like to offer a slightly different proposal. In my view, the previous version of vv. 1–2 read:
In the year that the Tartan who was sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against Ashdod and captured it; [2] at that time Yhwh spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying . . .
An argument favoring the latter reconstruction is the fact that at the end of v. 1, which is regarded by De Jong as being a secondary addition, the combination of the verb לחם Niphal (‘to fight’) with the preposition בְ (‘against’) is employed: ‘and he fought against Ashdod’. When looking at the way this verb is used throughout Isaiah 1–39, it becomes clear that לחם Niphal occurs with different prepositions. In some texts it governs the preposition בְ , while in other texts it is construed with the preposition 13:עַ ל
לחם Niphal + בְ : to fight + against (cf. Isa. 19:2; 20:1; 30:32) לחם Niphal + עַ ל : to fight + against (cf. Isa. 7:1; 37:8)
11 Cf. M.J. de Jong, Isaiah among the Ancient Near Eastern Prophets: A Comparative Study of the Earliest Stages of the Isaiah Tradition and the Neo-Assyrian Prophecies (VT.S 117), Leiden 2007, 151–152.
12 Cf. De Jong, Isaiah among the Ancient Near Eastern Prophets, 152, n. 488.
13 Besides the examples of Isa. 7:1 and 37:8, the combination of the verb לחם Niphal (‘to fight’) with the preposition עַ ל (‘against’) is found in Deut. 20:10, 19; Josh. 10:5, 34, 36, 38; 2 Kgs 12:18; 19:8; Jer. 21:2; 32:24, 29; 34:1, 7, 22; 37:8.

This variety in the use of the prepositions בְ and עַ ל with the verb לחם Niphal is observed not only in the Masoretic Text of Isaiah (MT), but also in the Isaiah manuscripts found among the Dead Sea scrolls. Though most of the manuscripts are fragmentary, they all reflect the same variety in how the two verbal patterns are used:14
Isaiah 1–39 Verb MT 1QIsaa 1QIsab 4QIsab
על + עַ ל + Niphal לחם Isa. 7:1 Isa. 19:2 לחם Niphal + ב + בְ + ב Isa. 20:1 לחם Niphal + ב + בְ + ב Isa. 30:32 לחם Niphal + בְ + ב על + על + עַ ל + Niphal לחם Isa. 37:8
It is noteworthy that both Isa. 7:1 and 37:8, in which the verb לחם Niphal occurs with the preposition עַ ל , have a parallel in 2 Kings: Isa. 7:1 is parallel to 2 Kgs 16:5; Isa. 37:8 is parallel to 2 Kgs 19:8. The common view is that both texts have been borrowed from the Book of Kings.15 The texts of Isa. 19:2 and 30:32, on the other hand, in which the verb לחם Niphal governs the preposition בְ , are usually seen as being connected to the earliest stages of the Book of Isaiah. De Jong, for example, claims that they are both early Isaianic texts. With regard to Isa. 19:2, he notes that this verse belongs to the oracle Isa. 19:1b–4, which probably dates back to the time of the prophet Isaiah himself.16 With regard to Isa. 30:32, De Jong comments that this verse is part of the unit Isa. 30:27–33, which contains ‘various elements that allude to other early texts within First Isaiah’.17 The combination of the verb לחם Niphal (‘to fight’) with the preposition בְ (‘against’) at the end of v. 1 is thus an indication that the expression ‘and

The Biblical Qumran Scrolls: Transcriptions and Textual Variants (VT.S 134), Leiden 2010. 15 Cf., e.g., M.J. de Jong, ‘From Legitimate King to Protected City: The Development of Isaiah 7:1–17’, in: A.L.H.M. van Wieringen, A. van der Woude (eds) ‘Enlarge the Site of your Tent’: The City as Unifying Theme in Isaiah (OTS 58), Leiden 2011, 24, who comments on Isa. 7:1: ‘verse 1 is commonly regarded as being dependent on 2 Kgs 16:5, and rightly so.’
16 Cf. De Jong, Isaiah among the Ancient Near Eastern Prophets, 150: ‘The context [of Isa. 19:1b–4] is probably the same as for the rest of the early material within 18–22*, the situation of 705–701 BCE.’

he fought against Ashdod and captured it’ was likely part of an older account underlying the current text of Isa. 20:1–2. The conclusion that an earlier version of Isaiah 20 has been reworked is substantiated by other older elements we encounter in vv. 1–2. Particularly noteworthy is the combination of the imperative form לך (‘go’) followed by the conjunction ו and the second person masculine singular perfect form פתחת (‘and loose’) in Isa. 20:2. A comparable syntactic construction is found in Isa. 6:9:
Isa. 20:2 Go, and loose the sackcloth from your loins Isa. 6:9 Go, and say to this people
Since most exegetes agree that the call narrative in Isaiah 6 substantially comes from the earliest literary layers of Isaiah 1–39, the syntactic parallel between Isa. 6:9 and 20:2 clearly indicates that Isaiah 20 contains older elements.18 On the basis of the linguistic parallels between Isaiah 20 and other early texts, it is likely that this passage was part of the earliest stages of the Isaiah tradition. At the same time, it can be observed that this earlier version of Isaiah 20 has been reworked. This raises the question as to whether we can find clues for the development of the narrative in Isaiah 20 within the Isaianic tradition.
6 Literary Observations
When examining the literary parallels between Isaiah 20 and other passages in Isaiah 1–39, we find striking similarities between words and phrases used in Isa. 20:1 and 36:2. Both Isaianic texts describe how the Assyrian king sends one of his main commanders to march against a rebellious city:
Isa. 20:1 In the year that the Tartan who was sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod . . . Isa. 36:2 The king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a great army.
Besides the lexical and thematic similarities, the connection between Isa. 20:1 and 36:2 requires attention because of the parallel to Isa. 36:2 in 2 Kgs 18:17. Unlike Isa. 36:2, 2 Kgs 18:17 narrates that King Sennacherib commanded not

only the Rabshakeh but also the Tartan and the Rabsaris to march from Lachish to Jerusalem:
2 Kgs 18:17 The king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a great army.
The reference to the Tartan in 2 Kgs 18:17 is interesting because the same military title is used in Isa. 20:1. Apart from 2 Kgs 18:17 and Isa. 20:1, this Assyrian military title is found nowhere else in the Old Testament. These observations raise the question of how the three texts, 2 Kgs 18:17, Isa. 20:1 and 36:2, are related to each other. Following the common view that Isaiah 36–39 has been borrowed from the Book of Kings, it is conceivable that the editor who copied 2 Kings 18–20 into the Isaianic tradition also reworked the older account in Isaiah 20.19 One can imagine that the one who was responsible for leaving out the reference to the Tartan in Isa. 36:2 was also responsible for inserting that phrase in Isa. 20:1. In doing so, the editor created a contrast between the military campaign of the Assyrian king Sargon against Ashdod and the campaign of the Assyrian king Sennacherib against Jerusalem. The people of Ashdod put their trust in the Egyptians and the Ethiopians, and their city was captured by the Assyrians. King Hezekiah and his people, however, put their trust in Yhwh, and their city was delivered. The Assyrians were not able to conquer Jerusalem (cf. Isa. 37:10, 33–35; 38:6). Assuming that a later editor reworked an earlier version of Isaiah 20, the question arises: who was responsible for editing the older text?
19 In recent years, several exegetes have defended the opposite perspective. For example, K.A.D. Smelik, ‘Distortion of Old Testament Prophecy: The Purpose of Isaiah xxxvi and xxxvii’, in: Crises and Perspectives: Studies in Ancient Near Eastern Polytheism, Biblical Theology, Palestinian Archeology and Intertestamental Literature (OTS 24), Leiden 1986, 70–93, claims that Isaiah 36–37 was originally written as part of the Book of Isaiah. Though Smelik makes clear that Isaiah 36–37 fits the context of the Book of Isaiah well, the chronological heading in Isa. 36:1 (parallel 2 Kgs 18:13) is in my view still a strong argument for the majority opinion that 2 Kings 18–19 has been copied into the Isaianic tradition.

7 Indications of Redactional Activity
On the basis of similarities between the narratives in Isaiah 7, 20 and 36–39, Blenkinsopp assumes that the account in chapter 20 has a Deuteronomistic origin. In his view, the Deuteronomistic background of this passage is supported by the presence of several characteristics of Deuteronomistic-type historiographical narrative in the text. With regard to vv. 1–2, Blenkinsopp mentions three expressions he identifies as Deuteronomistic elements:20
The temporal phrase בׇּ עֵ ת ׇה ִהיא (‘at that time’) at the beginning of v. 2;21 The combination of the verb דבר Piel (‘to speak’) with the phrase ביד (‘through’) in v. 2;22 The reference to the prophet’s full name, ‘Isaiah son of Amoz’, in v. 2.
Though there is good reason to adopt Blenkinsopp’s suggestion that these elements have a Deuteronomistic background, it is questionable whether they prove that Isaiah 20 as a whole is a Deuteronomistic composition. It is also possible that they have been added by a Deuteronomistic editor.23 The latter option is supported by three observations. First, the time reference, ׇבּעֵ ת ׇה ִהיא (‘at that time’) at the beginning of v. 2 is identified by Blenkinsopp as a Deuteronomistic element. The reconstruction of Isa. 20:1–2 presented above, however, showed that the temporal phrase ‘at that time’ is probably a later addition. Second, the combination of the verb דבר Piel (‘to speak’) with ביד (‘through’) in v. 2 has an unusual meaning. This verbal pattern usually expresses that Yhwh
20 Cf. Blenkinsopp, Isaiah 1–39, 321. In his view, ‘the most telling indication of Deuteronomistic origin’ is the reference to Isaiah as ‘the servant of Yhwh’ in v. 3. 21 Besides Isa. 20:2, this temporal phrase occurs in Isa. 18:7 and 39:1 (parallel 2 Kgs 20:12). 22 According to Balogh, Stele of YHWH in Egypt, 307, the combination of the verb דבר Piel (‘to speak’) with ביד (‘through’) has a parallel in Hag. 2:1–2: ‘Even though the syntax of Isa. 20:2 is unusual, it is not entirely without parallels. Hag. 2:1–2 provides a strikingly similar case’. In my view, Hag. 2:1–2 does not offer help for understanding the syntactic construction in Isa. 20:2, because the word of Yhwh is not addressed here to Haggai but instead to Zerubbabel. The pattern in Hag. 2:1–2 is probably a variant to the syntactic construction used in Hag. 1:1–2 and 1:3–4. 23 Cf. W.A.M. Beuken, Jesaja 13–27 (Herders Theologischer Kommentar zum Alten Testament), Freiburg 2007, 208–9; De Jong, Isaiah among the Ancient Near Eastern Prophets, 151.

speaks by means of one of his servants to someone else.24 Here, Yhwh does not speak through the prophet Isaiah but instead Isaiah himself is addressed. Isaiah is ordered to loose the sackcloth from his loins and to take his sandals off his feet and to walk naked and barefoot. The unusual meaning of the verbal pattern can be explained by assuming that an older account has been reworked. By adding the phrase ביד (‘through’) the editor changed Yhwh’s command to Isaiah to loose his sackcloth and take off his sandals into a message of Yhwh for the people of Jerusalem. In v. 3, it is made clear that Yhwh commissioned his servant Isaiah to walk naked and barefoot for three years as sign and portent against Egypt and Ethiopia. The personal command of Yhwh to the prophet to walk naked and barefoot as a sign of mourning (cf. Mic. 1:8) was thus changed into a symbolic act to warn the people of Jerusalem not to rely on Egypt and Ethiopia. Finally, the reference to the prophet’s full name is worth examining. Apart from Isa. 20:2, the designation ‘Isaiah son of Amoz’ occurs six times in the Book of Isaiah. The prophet’s full name is used in the superscriptions in Isa. 1:1, 2:1, and 13:1. Furthermore, this designation occurs three times in the narrative section Isaiah 36–39, namely, Isa. 37:2, 21, and 38:1. The fact that the prophet’s full name occurs three times in Isaiah 36–39 does not necessarily indicate that Isaiah 20 as a whole has a Deuteronomistic origin. As has been made clear above, it is plausible that the editor who copied 2 Kings 18–20 into the Isaianic tradition also reworked the older text of Isaiah 20. That editor was acquainted with the prophet’s full name and might well have been responsible for inserting the designation ‘Isaiah son of Amoz’ into Isa. 20:2. The above considerations lead to the conclusion that Blenkinsopp’s hypothesis regarding the Deuteronomistic origin of the account in Isaiah 20 cannot be proved.25 The expressions in this passage that have been identified as Deuteronomistic elements can better be regarded as later additions that were inserted by a Deuteronomistic editor. At the same time, it can be observed that the Deuteronomistic elements are closely tied with the other elements in
24 Cf. Exod. 9:35; Lev. 10:11; Num. 17:5; 27:23; Josh. 20:2; 1 Sam. 28:17; 1 Kgs 8:53, 56; 12:15; 14:18; 15:29; 16:12, 34; 17:16; 2 Kgs 9:36; 10:10; 14:25; 17:23; 21:10; 24:2; Jer. 37:2; 50:1; 2 Chron. 10:15. 25 This conclusion is in line with Brekelmans’s observation that Old Testament scholars tend to ‘ascribe too many things [in the prophetic writings] to the deuteronomistic movement’, cf. C.H.W. Brekelmans, ‘Deuteronomistic Influence in Isaiah 1–12’, in J. Vermeylen (ed.) The Book of Isaiah. Le livre d’Isaïe: Les oracles et leurs relectures unité et complexité de l’ouvrage (BETL 81), Leuven 1989, 176. See also J.R. Porter, ‘The Supposed Deuteronomic Redaction of the Prophets: Some Considerations’, in: R. Albertz et al. (eds) Schöpfung und Befreiung: Für Claus Westermann zum 80. Geburtstag, Stuttgart 1989, 69–78.



Text and History of Isaiah 20 87
the current composition. For that reason, it is likely that the Deuteronomistic elements are not individual secondary additions, but instead are part of a broader revision of the existing text. This suggestion is supported by the proposed reconstruction of vv. 1–2, which shows that the Deuteronomistic phrase ׇבּעֵ ת ׇה ִהיא (‘at that time’) is one of the elements the editor of the older account used in expanding the existing text. Moreover, this reconstruction indicates that the editor who inserted the Deuteronomistic elements into Isaiah 20 was probably the same one who reworked the earlier account underlying the current text of Isaiah 20.
8 Relationship to Extra-Biblical Sources
The next point that needs our attention is the relationship between the biblical account in Isaiah 20 and the references to the military campaign against Ashdod in extra-biblical sources. As was noted above, Assyrian inscriptions indicate that King Sargon II personally conquered the city of Ashdod. In the Khorsabad Annals King Sargon claims:
[In a sudden rage] I marched quickly – (even) in my state-chariot and (only) with my cavalry which never, even in friendly territory, leaves my side – against Ashdod, his royal residence, and I besieged and conquered the cities Ashdod, Gath (Gi-im-tu) (and) Asdudimmu26
This report is not consistent with the account in Isaiah 20, which says that King Sargon sent his commander-in-chief, the Tartan, to Ashdod. Some biblical scholars explain the discrepancy between the biblical account and the Assyrian inscription by calling into question the historical reliability of the Assyrian report. For example, Oswalt points out that ancient kings ‘were prone to claim full responsibility for all victories in annalistic reports’.27 A similar view is defended by Balogh. He suggests that the account in Isaiah 20 is more accurate, since ‘the king’s contention may be, as usual, ideologically motivated’.28
26 Cf. Khorsabad Annals, lines 249–62; see also Display Inscription, lines 90–112. The translation of the Assyrian inscriptions has been taken from J.B. Pritchard (ed.), Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, Princeton 31969, 286. ‘Asdudimmu’ is the Assyrian name of the port Ashdod-Yam, that is, Ashdod-on-Sea. 27 Cf. Oswalt, Book of Isaiah, 383.
28 Cf. Balogh, Stele of YHWH in Egypt, 328.



88 Oosting
Another attempt to harmonize the two accounts is offered by Hayim Tadmor, who suggests that the Assyrian campaign against Ashdod did not take place in 711 BCE as is usually assumed, but instead in 712 BCE. In the Eponym Chronicles of the Assyrian Empire, the entry for the year 712 is ‘in the land’. From that Tadmor deduces that King Sargon stayed in the land and that the punitive expedition against Ashdod was probably led by his commander-inchief, the Tartan. Tadmor assumes that the reason that Sargon II remained behind was that his presence ‘was required by the building of his new residence, Dur-Šarrukin’.29 It is, however, more likely that the entry ‘in the land’ in the Eponym Chronicles does not describe the situation of the king, but the situation of the royal army.30 Furthermore, if the punitive expedition against Ashdod had taken place, one expects that this military campaign would be referred to under the year 712 in the Eponym Chronicles.31 For those reasons, it is better to hold to the common view that the campaign against Ashdod took place in 711 BCE and was led by King Sargon himself. In my view, there is no need to try to harmonize the two accounts on the Assyrian campaign against Ashdod. The discrepancy between Isaiah 20 and the Assyrian inscriptions may well be explained by the reworking of the biblical account. As demonstrated above, the first two verses of Isaiah 20 were probably edited by a later writer who inserted the reference to the Tartan in order to relate the Assyrian military campaign against Ashdod to the Assyrian campaign against Jerusalem referred to in Isaiah 36–37. As a consequence, the account in Isaiah 20 no longer depicted King Sargon as the one who led the military campaign against Ashdod, but instead his commander-inchief, the Tartan. Assuming that an older version of Isaiah 20 depicted Sargon as the one who led the punitive expedition against Ashdod, it is reasonable to suppose that this earlier account survived from near the time of the event, that is, the time of the prophet Isaiah himself. An argument supporting this conclusion
29 Cf. H. Tadmor, ‘The Campaigns of Sargon II of Assur: A Chronological-Historical Study’, JCS 12 (1958), 79, n. 208. The same view is defended by K.L. Younger, ‘Recent Study on Sargon II, King of Assyria: Implications for Biblical Studies’, in: M.W. Chavalas, K.L. Younger (eds), Mesopotamia and the Bible: Comparative Explorations, Grand Rapids 2002, 315.

Chr. nach Prismenfragmenten aus Ninive und Assur (SAAS 8), Helsinki 1998, 86: ‘Hätte sich der Feldzug gegen Ašdod im Jahre 712 ereignet, so wäre infolgedessen ein Eintrag “gegen Ašdod” oder zumindest “die Großen gegen Ašdod” zu erwarten. Wenn dort stattdessen die Bemerkung “im Land” zu lesen steht, so kann im Jahre 712 überhaupt kein Feldzug stattgefunden haben.’



Text and History of Isaiah 20 89
is the fact that the account of the campaign against Ashdod has no parallel elsewhere in the Old Testament and that this is the only explicit reference to King Sargon II at all.32
9 Development within the Isaianic Tradition
The analysis of the linguistic and syntactic features of the text of Isaiah 20 in its final form has made clear that this passage contains several elements that allude to other early texts within Isaiah 1–39. Those elements indicate that an older version underlies the current text of Isaiah 20. The fact that we only have the text of Isaiah 20 in its current form makes certainty concerning the earlier account impossible. Though an attempt can be made to reconstruct the earlier version of Isaiah 20, the reconstruction itself is not the main purpose of this examination. In examining the development of Isaiah 20 within the Isaianic tradition, it is more important to know that the text has been edited than to know exactly what the older version looked like.33 The conclusion that an earlier version of Isaiah 20 has been reworked shows that texts in the Isaianic tradition were not static, but instead were part of a living tradition. The historical references in Isaiah 20 and the close parallels between the older version of Isaiah 20 and the Assyrian reports provide a basis for supposing that the earlier account was written shortly after the fall of Ashdod. One can imagine that the conquest of Ashdod left a deep impression on the people of Judah. From Assyrian sources we know that the king of Ashdod, Yamani, called the rulers of Palestine, Judah, Edom, and Moab to join him in rebelling against the king of Assyria. Nineveh Prism A reads:
[to] the rulers of Palestine (Pi-liš-te), Judah (Ia-ú-di), Ed[om], Moab (and) those who live (on islands) and bring tribute [and] tâmartu -gifts to my lord Ashur – [he spread] countless evil lies to alienate (them) from me34

33 In my view, P.M. Cook, A Sign and a Wonder: The Redactional Formation of Isaiah 18–20 (VT.S, 147), Leiden 2011, 126, n. 2, concludes too hastily that leaving aside ‘the wealth of Deuteronomistic expressions in these verses [Isa. 20:1–4], very little would remain without them.’ Even if we do not know exactly what remains of Isaiah 20 without later additions, we still can assume that there is an older text, which underlies the current one. 34 Nineveh Prism A, fragment D, lines 28–32. Cf. Pritchard, ANET, 287; see also Z.J. Kapera, ‘The Oldest Account of Sargon II’s Campaign against Ashdod’, Folia Orientalia 24 (1987), 33.

We don’t know whether the Judeans accepted the invitation to join the rebellion against the Assyrians. But in either case, they had reason to be terrified about their own future. If the people of Ashdod were not able to resist the king of Assyria, how would they escape? At a later time, the older account was reworked by an editor, who related the narrative in Isaiah 20 to the narrative in Isaiah 36–37 about the siege of Jerusalem. In doing so, the editor created a contrast between the Assyrian military campaigns against Ashdod and Jerusalem. Whereas the city of Ashdod was captured because the people of Ashdod put their trust in Egypt and Ethiopia, Jerusalem was delivered because King Hezekiah and his people put their trust in Yhwh. The fall of Ashdod was thus no longer described as an isolated event in the later composition of Isaiah, but was related to the deliverance of Jerusalem described in Isaiah 36–39. In the current composition of Isaiah, chapter 20 is not directly connected to the narrative section in Isaiah 36–39, but instead is part of the oracles against the nations (Isaiah 13–23).35 Within this collection, the narrative in Isaiah 20 is linked to the preceding chapters by the references to Ethiopia and Egypt in vv. 3–5. For that reason, it is often considered to be the concluding passage of the literary unity Isaiah 18–20 about Ethiopia and Egypt.36 Furthermore, Isaiah 20 is connected to the previous passage, Isa. 19:18–24, by the reference to the great maritime highway in Isa. 19:23. This highway, which ran along the Palestinian coast from Egypt and then crossed eastwards to Syria and Mesopotamia, is the same route the Assyrians take in Isaiah 20 to march against Ashdod and then use to lead away the Egyptians and the Ethiopians as exiles. In Isa. 19:18–24, however, the highway is not used for military activities or deportation, but instead for pilgrimage. Verse 23 reads:
Isa. 19:23 On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come into Egypt, and the Egyptians into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
The previous passage on the harmony between Egypt and Assyria thus sheds new light on the narrative in Isaiah 20. Verse 23 promises that the highway

from Egypt to Mesopotamia will no longer be used for military activities or deportation, but instead for pilgrimage. The maritime highway will serve to aid both the inhabitants of Egypt and Assyria to worship together the God of Israel.37
10 Conclusions
Isaiah 20 has been handed over to us as part of the Book of Isaiah. Though we merely have the text of this passage in its current form, we are able to examine the development of Isaiah 20 within the Isaianic tradition on the basis of the linguistic and literary features of Isaiah 20 itself and on the basis of the parallels between Isaiah 20 and other biblical and non-biblical texts. The examination shows that Isaiah 20 has not been a static text, but instead is the product of a living tradition. The linguistic and syntactic features of Isaiah 20 show that an older version of Isaiah 20 underlies the current text. On the basis of the syntactic parallels between Isaiah 20 and other passages in Isaiah 1–39 that are considered to be early, it is likely that this older version belonged to the earliest stages of the Isaiah tradition. In later times, the older account was reworked by an editor who related the Assyrian military campaign against Ashdod under Sargon II to the siege of Jerusalem under King Sennacherib. In doing so, the editor created a contrast between the fall of Ashdod in Isaiah 20 and the deliverance of Jerusalem in Isaiah 36–39. In the current composition of Isaiah, the narrative in Isaiah 20 is part of the oracles against the foreign nations (chapters 13–23). More specifically, it concludes the collection about Ethiopia and Egypt in Isaiah 18–20. The conclusion that Isaiah 20 is the product of a living tradition explains why the account in Isaiah 20 is not fully historically accurate. The main aim of the writers and the copyists of the Isaianic corpus was not the historical reliability of this passage, but its relation to the other parts of the book. It was their job to adapt and rearrange the account on the military campaign against Ashdod, so that it kept its relevance within the Isaianic tradition.

From Salvation to Doom: Isaiah’s Message in the Hezekiah Story
Thomas Wagner
The Hezekiah story has been investigated in many respects during the last decades by focusing on its original context and its redactional shape in the Book of Kings and the Book of Isaiah. Even if the origins of the story are still controversial it seems that OT research found a common sense due to the redactional shape of the story especially within the Book of Isaiah. Since chapters 36–37 belong to a late 7th-century or early 6th-century edition of the book, chapters 38 and 39 were added in the process of merging First and Second Isaiah in early post-exilic times.1 Finally the psalm of Hezekiah in ch. 38 was integrated in later times displaying the image of a pious king.2 In their redaction-critical analyses most of the investigators focus on the questions of the interrelation of Isa. 36–39 to other texts of First Isaiah and on connections between First and Second Isaiah demonstrating that Isa. 36–39 serve as link between these two parts of the book.3 In this article I will go into that matter by highlighting compositioncritical aspects of the Hezekiah story, their interconnections in the so-called

Williamson, The Book Called Isaiah: Deutero-Isaiah’s Role in Composition and Redaction, Oxford 1994, 189–211, who observes that prospective interrelations to Second Isaiah are too weak to assume the chapters were originally written as a link between First and Second Isaiah. But in the final book they serve as link. In favor of a later addition of Isa. 36–39 argue R.E. Clements, ‘The Unity of the Book of Isaiah,’ Int 36 (1982), 117–29 (esp. 122), O.

‘Großjesajabuch’, and the development of the prophet’s image.4 Starting with a brief description of narratological aspects of the redactional unit Isa. 36–39 to outline the authors’ intentions, the article will then show in which texts the structure identified in this unit is included. Finally it will deal with the question with which consequences this structure was adopted.
1 Isaiah in the Hezekiah Story
The unit Isa 36–39 is subdivided into three passages, which begin with various temporal formulas. Chapters 36–37 are introduced with ויהי בארבע רהשׂע נהשׁ למלך חזקיהו , ‘in the fourteenth year of the king Hezekiah’, chapter 38 with בימים ההם , ‘in those days’, and chapter 39 with בעת ההוא , ‘at that time’. “These formulas tie the subunits together as three separate episodes that relate to the same event: Sennacherib’s invasion of Judah in 701.”5 In this unit the prophet Isaiah occurs four times with alternating functions. His first entrance takes place during the siege of Jerusalem in Isa 37 in the house of the prophet. Eljakim, the royal housekeeper, and Shebna, the scribe, were sent by Hezekiah to ask the prophet to intercede to save the rest of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Here the prophet is asked to function as an intercessor. Isaiah answers as diviner using the formula אל־תירא , by which a word of salvation is introduced. He mainly serves as divine messenger. The second time the prophet appears, he delivers a divine response to Hezekiah’s prayer. In this situation he functions again as a herald. Different from his first appearance the prophet takes the action and passes on the
4 Cf. the semantical links mentioned by Williamson, Book Called Isaiah, 210, and Berges, Buch Jesaja, 276: “Hätten diese Kapitel im Jesajabuch nun die Funktion einer Überleitung zum Ende der babylonischen Zeit, dann könnten sie erst nachdeuterojesajanisch ins Buch gelangt sein; gegen die Möglichkeit, die HJE seien zusammen mit dem Anschluß von deuterojesajanischem Material ins Buch gelangt, spricht die Tatsache, daß die Thematik des Gotteshauses ‘ תיב ’ als Ortes des gemeinsamen Gotteslobes, die der J-Text in Differenz zum K-Text so stark betont (38,19–20), in 40–55 nicht, wohl aber in 56,5.7 und 66,20 auftaucht; gehört diese Klammer um 56–66 zur letzten Redaktionsschicht, dann müssen 36–39 im Zuge eben dieser Schlußredaktion in die Mitte des Buches plaziert worden sein. Sollten sich die Eunuchen von 56,3 auf die von 39,7 beziehen, ware das ein weiteres Indiz dafür, daß die HJE im Zuge der tritojesajanischen Anfügung in die Jesajarolle integriert worden sind.” Supporting the thesis of Berges this article points to a linking between Isa. 38 and Isa. 57 by which the assignment of Isa. 36–39 to the last redactional layer of the book becomes ambiguous. 5 Sweeney, Isaiah 1–39, 455.

promise that the Assyrian king will be judged due to his haughtiness (Isa. 37:29) and that he will not conquer Jerusalem (vv. 33–35). As a sign of confirmation God promises to Hezekiah to be able to farm his vineyards in the third year (vv. 30–31). In terms of a narratological investigation of Isa. 37 the basic opposition within the text is the change from the lament of Hezekiah expressed by tearing his clothes apart, which is a mourning ritual, to the killing of the king by his sons. In other words, the threat against Hezekiah and his kingdom turns to the doom of Sennacherib. As basic opponents appear the Assyrian king and the God of Israel,6 which is already expressed in the message delivered by the royal cupbearer Rabshakeh in Isa. 36:7–8, 15, 18.7 The message of Isaiah delivered in this context is obvious: The LORD will judge the Assyrian king for his arrogance and therefore he will save Jerusalem (Isa. 37:4).8 The announcement of doom for the Assyrian king is a promise for Jerusalem not to be delivered into the hand of Sennacherib (Isa. 37:10). Thus far the prophetic message contains a word of judgment against the Assyrian king, which implies a word of salvation for Jerusalem – not a general word for the everlasting existence of the city but rather one specifically for this situation.9 In the second passage of the Hezekiah story in Isa. 38 the king fell seriously ill. Isaiah appears again in vv. 1–8 and vv. 21–22. The prophet was sent to deliver a divine word (vv. 1–8) and to cure the king (vv. 21–22), which means he functions as herald and as healer. The narratological structure of this part of the story is determined by the antagonism between God and the Davidic king. The divine word in v. 1 contains just the prediction without any explanation for the announced occurrence. Hezekiah answers Isaiah’s message by praying to God and bringing to mind his faithfulness towards God during his entire lifetime. Hearing Hezekiah’s plea, God calls Isaiah to return to the king and to give him notice of an extension of his lifetime for another fifteen years. This prediction is confirmed by a divine sign (Isa. 38:7). The first announcement of the prophet serves as introduction to a story, by which the faithfulness of Hezekiah

Therefore both function as messenger for the respective opponent. 8 Cf. H. Wildberger, Jesaja 28–39 (BKAT X/3), Neukirchen-Vluyn 1982, 1431. 9 Cf. R.E.

shall be highlighted. By receiving the message of his imminent death the king points to God’s sovereignty and his dependence on God’s decisions. The climax of the story is the second divine word with God’s promise to save the king’s life10 and the preservation of the capital. The way the promise is expressed points to a restriction to the contemporary situation. By calling the LORD the God of Hezekiah’s father David (v. 5), the author reminds the reader of the promise of the eternal Davidic kingship.11 But God does not renew his pledge. Instead he points to an extension of Hezekiah’s lifetime and the stand of Jerusalem during the contemporary siege. Other than in Isa. 36–37 the message of the prophet is not a word of doom against Assur but a word of salvation for Hezekiah. In the third passage of the story in Isa. 39, Isaiah appears in front of Hezekiah to inquire after his foreign visitors and their purposes. The prophet announces the deportation of the treasure of the house of David (Isa. 39:6) and of the sons of Hezekiah to serve at the king’s palace in Babel (v. 7). He functions as herald again and delivers a word of judgment concerning the exile of the house of the king in later generations. The divine word receives a twofold interpretation: the prophet points to the word as an announcement of judgment against the house of the king (vv. 6–7) while Hezekiah reads it as a word of personal salvation (v. 8). The basic opposition appears as the change of status for the Davidic kingdom. At the beginning of the story the Babylonian king sends gifts to Hezekiah in relation to his recovery, at the end the Davidic king is foretold that his sons will not be accepted as sovereigns like their father, but will serve as butlers for the Babylonian king. Even if the author lets us know that Hezekiah understands the prophetic prediction as a word of salvation, it is a word of doom for the house of David.12 Summarizing the development of Isaiah’s message, it detracts from the prospects for the Davidic kingship. Admittedly Hezekiah could avoid the fall of his city and his soon-coming death by praying to God, but he finally has to accept the downgrading of his sons to servants of the Babylonian king. The salvation is limited to Jerusalem and Hezekiah while the doom relates to the Assyrian
10 Cf. Williamson, Book Called Isaiah, 202: “The climactic ‘and he recovered’ forms an effective contrast to the ‘you shall not recover’ in verse 1.” 11 Cf. Berges, Buch Jesaja, 313: “Die Bezeichnung JHWHs als Gott Davids ‘ דוד יהל ’ steht mit der dtr Vorstellung von der göttlichen Gnade um seines Knechtes David willen im Verbindung”. 12 Cf. Seitz, Zion’s Final Destiny, 155: “Chapter 39, whatever else is to be said about it, points to judgment, not restoration. It does so not metaphorically, nor in a veiled way, but by means of direct prophecy (39:5–7). Davidic kingship will come to an end, and Hezekiah’s sons will be sārîsîm in the palace of the king of Babylon (39:7).”

king and the house of David. This development is dependent on the formation of the Book of Isaiah. Isaiah’s words are interconnected with texts of different stages, in which the image of the prophet displayed in Isa 36–39 changes.
2 The Doom Against the Assyrian King
In the mid 1970s Hermann Barth pointed to a redactional layer added to the First Isaianic collection in the late 7th century BCE called ‘Assur-Redaktion’. In this addition, the redactor emphasizes God’s rejection of the Assyrian king due to his haughtiness as presented in Isa. 10:5–19*.13 Barth discovers the end of this redactional layer in Isa. 31:5, 8b–9 as addition to the basic layer of the ‘Assur-Zyklus’ in Isa. 28–31. The basic layer includes five words introduced with הוי in Isa. 28:1–4, 29:1–8, 29:15–16, 30:1–5 and 31:1–3. These words contain threats against the Jerusalemites and the Davidic kingdom to refrain from coalitions with Egypt (especially words four and five). As expressed in word two, God will terrify Jerusalem by calling the nations to besiege the city. This event just serves to terrify the Judeans, as it is expressed in the redactional addition following the last הוי -word in Isa. 31:4–5, 8–9:14
4 For thus the Lord has spoken to me: As a lion roars, and a young lion over his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is summoned against him, He will not be afraid of their voice nor be disturbed by their noise. So the Lord of hosts will come down to fight for Mount Zion and for its hill. 5 Like birds flying about, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem. Defending, He will also deliver it; passing over, He will preserve it. 8 Then Assyria shall fall by a sword not of man, and a sword not of mankind shall devour him. But he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become forced labor. 9 He shall cross over to his stronghold for fear, and

Smelik, ‘Distortion of Old Testament Prophecy’, 78–79; Sweeney, Isaiah 1–39, 480, and R.A. Young, Hezekiah in History and Tradition (VTS 151), Leiden 2012, 131, assume that the author of Isa. 36–37 had the narration Isa. 10:5–15 already in mind. 14 For Isa. 31:4–5, 8–9 as a redactional addition to Isa 31:1–3 cf. J. Kreuch, Unheil und Heil bei Jesaja: Studien zur Entstehung des Assur-Zyklus Jesaja 28–31 (WMANT 130), NeukirchenVluyn 2011, 386–9. With small textual differences cf. also Barth, Jesaja-Worte, 79–92, who adds v. 8a to the basic layer of Isa. 31:1–4, 8a, and Clements, Isaiah 1–39, 7. Kreuch shows that v. 4 and v. 8a belong to the ‘Assur-Redaktion’.



From Salvation to Doom 97
his princes shall be afraid of the banner, says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
The announcement of divine judgment informs the reader about the end of the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem and describes a situation very similar, though not identical, to the pledge of Isaiah in Isa. 37. The LORD will come to set an end to the Assyrian siege by killing the troops and by letting the king escape from his sword. “Die Weissagung göttlichen Schutzes ‘ גנן ’ und Errettung ‘ נצל ’ (hif.) zugunsten Jerusalems (31,5) löst JHWH fast wortwörtlich in 37,35; 38,6 ein.”15 However, Isa. 37 also contains several differences to the announcement in Isa. 31:4–5, 8–9. It is not the LORD himself but his messenger who kills 185.000 soldiers. The Assyrian king was finally murdered by his own sons. This aspect is missing in the announcement of the 7th century redaction (cf. Isa. 14:24–27). Taking into account these differences and the closed structure of the narration in Isa. 37 it is justifiable to believe that Isa. 36–37 were written independently and added at a later stage to confirm the announcement of Isa. 10:5–19* and Isa. 31:4–5, 8–9.16 The story affirms that the expectation of the failure of the Assyrian occupation became true. A problem usually
15 Berges, Buch Jesaja, 286. Berges also points to the speech of the Assyrian messenger, in which aspects already mentioned in the basic layer of the ‘Assur-Zyklus’ are integrated: “Man gewinnt den Eindruck, der Rabschake sei ein gelehriger ‘Schüler Jesajas’, zumindest aber ein gutter Kenner des Jesajabuches, wenn er sagt, allein Lippenbekenntnisse seien noch keine עצה oder גבודה die eine Schlacht entscheiden könnten (36,5); die Bezüge auf 29,15; 30,1 (Pläne mit Ägypten an JHWH vorbei schmieden) und auf 30,15 (Vertrauen und Ruhe sind eure Stärke) sind augenfällig” (295; cf. also 305). Cf. also F.J. Gonçalves, L’expédition de Sennachérib en Palestine dans la littérature Hébraïque ancienne (Publication de l’Institut Orientaliste de Louvain 34), Louvain 1986, 434. Berges, Buch Jesaja, 296, emphasizes deuteronomistic ideas in the speech of Rabshakeh (cf. Deut. 30:15–20), which indicate that his message was written in a wider tradition-historical perspective. 16 R.E. Clements, ‘The Prophecies of Isaiah to Hezekiah’, in: idem, Old Testament Prophecy: From Oracles to Canon, Louisville 1996, 37, and Berges, Buch Jesaja, 285, point to Isa. 10:27 as an announcement which has become fulfilled by the appending of Isa. 36–37. Isa. 10:27 is a later redactional addition to Isa. 10:5–19*, which belongs to the ‘Assur-Redaktion’. I would like to thank Reinhard G. Kratz for responding to my paper when delivered in Utrecht with the remark that “v. 8a and the announcement that Assur will not fall by the sword of a man is a hint that the ‘Assur-Redaktion’ might depend on the account of the siege of Jerusalem in 2 Kgs 18–19”. U. Becker, Jesaja–von der Botschaft zum Buch (FRLANT 178), Göttingen 1997, 220–2, already pointed to the dependency of the ‘Assur-Redaktion’ but he excluded Isa. 31:4–5, 8–9 from the redactional layer. It seems that a further investigation of the relation of the ‘Assur-Redaktion’ and the Hezekiah story is desirable.

is that collections of prophetic words in their written form miss words of confirmation. In this case that was solved by adding the narration of the failure of the Assyrian campaign.17 Asking for the narratological function of Isa. 36–37 for the entire Book of Isaiah one may assume that the story serves to complete the controversy between God and the Assyrian king.18
3 The Loss of the Davidic Kingship in Isa 39
As several investigations show, Isa. 39 belongs to another literary layer and therefore needs to serve in the Book of Isaiah at a later redactional stage.19 Peter Ackroyd, Ronald Clements, and in their line many other commentators point to chapter 39 as a literary link between First and Second Isaiah. According to them, the announcement of doom to Hezekiah reflects the fall of Jerusalem and the Davidic dynasty, which was not mentioned in First Isaiah but which is a precondition for understanding the situations described in Isa. 40–55.20 Clements outlines the problems of this assumption: he shows that as in the Book of Kings the announcement of doom for Hezekiah refers to the events of 598 BCE. However, in the context of the Book of Isaiah the story needs to justify the judgment against Judah in 587 BCE. Clements argues that Hezekiah’s healing serves to describe the persistence of the house of David in 598 BCE
17 Cf. Berges, Buch Jesaja, 303, who emphasizes the meaning of Isa. 36–37 for readers of the final form of the book: “Für den Leser des Buches bedeutet das: Wenn sich die antiassyrischen Orakel der חזון des Propheten bereits zu seinen Lebzeiten so eindeutig erfüllten, dann werden sich auch seine Verheißungen im zweiten Teil der Rolle mit eben solcher Sicherheit erfüllen!”
18 Cf. J.W. Groves, Actualization and Interpretation in the Old Testament (SBL.DS 86), Atlanta 1987, 197, who points to diverse interconnections of Isa. 36–37 to texts of the ‘Assur-Zyklus’ (Isa. 30:1–8, 30:15, 31:1–3) and the ‘Assur-Redaktion’ (10:8–11, 14:13–14). C. Hardmeier, Prophetie im Streit vor dem Untergang Judas: Erzählkommunikative Studien zur Entstehungssituation der Jesaja- und Jeremiaerzählungen in II Reg 18–20 und Jer 37–40 (BZAW 187), Berlin, New York 1990, 125–26, emphasizes three aspects by which Isa. 36–37 is related to First Isaiah: 1. JHWH’s acting for Jerusalem, 2. the call for trust (Isa. 7:9b) which is fulfilled by Hezekiah, and 3. the end of the Assyrian arrogance. 19 Cf. Young, Hezekiah, 134, who outlines that “the stories in Isa. 38–39 of Hezekiah’s illness and the Babylonian delegation who come to pay their respect can only be argued as having literary ties with the Book of Isaiah by looking forward. These two chapters do not accord with the prophet Isaiah’s Zionist theology, which advocates the inviolability of Jerusalem and the favored status of YHWH’s chosen ruler.” 20 Cf. Ackroyd, ‘Isaiah 36–39’, 113: “Its theme is of submission to Babylon, the inevitability of exile, the downfall of the Davidic monarchy”.



From Salvation to Doom 99
and the announcement of doom for Hezekiah the fall of the Davidic kingship 11 years later.21 From a redaction-critical point of view his thesis might explain the redactional process. However, from a composition-critical perspective one needs to ask how a reader, who is not intimately familiar with the exact course of the historical events, should read the story in this way and detect the function of Isa. 39 for the Book of Isaiah. So it seems to me that it is necessary to ask for another reference point than the twofold siege of Jerusalem to understand the function of Isa. 39. The outlined narratological aspects may help to find it. In his doctoral thesis Michael Pietsch investigated the reception of the promise to David in the entire Hebrew Bible. He shows that in Chapters. 40–66 the Book of Isaiah points to the promise only in transformation but not in its original sense.22 This sense is relevant for the controversy between the prophet and the Judean kings Ahaz and Hezekiah in Isa. 7 and Isa. 38–39 and in the announcements of the new king in Isa. 9 and Isa. 11. Moreover, it is surprising that the theme does not emerge in Isa. 40–66 anymore. The visit of the Babylonian delegation and Hezekiah’s frankness to show all his property results in the prophet’s word about the fall of the Davidic kingship. Isaiah announces in Isa. 39:6–7 that the entire property of the house of David will be brought to Babylon and that a number of Hezekiah’s sons will have to serve as eunuchs at the Babylonian royal court. The basic opposition of the text already points to that development: at the beginning Hezekiah and the Babylonian king appear as equal figures. At the end, the members of the Davidic dynasty have to serve at the Babylonian royal court. The text emphasizes the loss of meaning and acceptance of the house of David.23

V4f.)”. 23 Cf. Wildberger, Jesaja 28–39, 1471, and Beuken, Jesaja 28–39, 450: “Das Ende der Dynastie kommt hier in den Blick: Nicht nur wird dasjenige, was Hiskijas Vorfahren an Besitz und damit Macht aufgebaut haben, seinen Nachkommen genommen, sondern seinen Söhnen wird auch eine Funktion übertragen werden, in der keinerlei Ansprüche auf den Thron bestehen und die den weiteren Bestand in den Nachkommen sogar physisch ausschließt [. . .].”

Taking this observation in account, the function of this narration for the Book of Isaiah as a book merged from First and Second Isaiah is to initialize the announcement of Cyrus as the LORD’s Anointed in Isa. 44:24–45:7. This is the only text in Isa. 40–66, in which a royal figure appears as a person appointed by God. He is designated to take the role of the announced king of Isa. 9 and 11 since the Davidic covenant is related to God’s people (Isa. 55:3).24 Since Isa. 11 points to the house of David as the origin of the new king, Cyrus is a foreign ruler without any relation to the former Judean dynasty. Referring to a synchronic reading of the Book of Isaiah it is necessary to compensate for this contradiction. Cyrus could not become the Anointed One as long as the promise to the house of David is still relevant. With the announcement of the fall of the Davidic dynasty and the subordination of the descendants under the Babylonian king, the call of Cyrus becomes possible in the notion of the reader.25 What is formulated as an anticipation of the deportation of king Jehoiachin and his sons in the book of Kings in 2 Kgs 20,26 is used as an explanation for why Cyrus could be called by the LORD even if this contradicts the expectation of Isa. 11.27

Ackroyd, ‘Isaiah 36–39’, 119; Sweeney, Isaiah 1–39, 511: “The guarantee to the people is therefore based on the old Davidic covenant, but the guarantee of security is applied to them, not to the monarch.” And as he fills this out in another article: “Among other concerns, it [the interrelationship between Isa. 56–66 and the Book of Isaiah TW] points to a new understanding of the Davidic covenant in these chapters that accounts for the realities of Persian rule and the demise of the house of David. This is especially noteworthy in that the following discussion shows that Isaiah 11,1–16, the oracle concerning the establishment of a righteous Davidic monarch over a reconstituted and reunited Israel, plays a particularly prominent role in the message of Trito-Isaiah” (M.A. Sweeney, ‘The Reconceptualization of the Davidic covenant in Isaiah,’ in: J. van Ruiten, M. Vervenne (eds), Studies in the Book of Isaiah: Festschrift Willem A.M. Beuken [BEThL 82], Leuven 1997, 49). Sweeney misses showing how the redactor prepared for the later reinterpretation of the Davidic covenant by excluding the house of David from the promise. 25 Sweeney, ‘Reconceptualization’, 47, already points to the discrepancy without drawing the conclusions. 26 Cf. Sweeney, Isaiah 1–39, 510. 27 Cf. Smelik, ‘Distortion of Old Testament Prophecy, 85, who dates the inclusion of Isa. 39 to the Persian period. Therefore the hope of a reinstallation of a Judean king lasted until the times of Haggai and Zechariah. This corresponds a. with the assumption of the merging of First and Second Isaiah in post-exilic times, and b. with the observation that the narration in 2 Kgs 20 serves to look ahead to the deportation of Jehoiachin’s sons, which is not mentioned in Second Isaiah, and that the function of the story thus needs to vary in the Book of Isaiah.



From Salvation to Doom 101
The call of Cyrus is an announcement of a future event, which is surprising for the reader. Like in Isa. 36–39 the prophet acts as a messenger heralding God’s impact on history. This means his prophecy is orientated towards the course of history by referring to unique historical events. Thus the function of the prophet does not change even if the genres of texts included in Second Isaiah are different from the prophetic narration in Isa. 36–39.
4 Hezekiah’s Prayer in Isa 38:9–20
In the last stage of the literary history of the Hezekiah story this prayer was added. The text is missing in the parallel version in 2 Kgs 20. There must be a reason for including the prayer due to the literary concept of the Book of Isaiah in this stage. As pointed out by several investigations the psalm was composed in later Persian times. Therefore Hezekiah is presented as a faithful king parallel to his image in Chronicles. Referring to these investigations, Hezekiah became a role model for a true believer as appearing in Isa. 56–66. However, the investigators miss showing how a reader of the Book of Isaiah should identify the king as a role model by reading the later texts.28 The prayer contains semantic correlations to numerous Isaianic texts. But most of the semantic links do not constitute a thematic relationship between these texts. There is only one exception: as regards the subject matter there is an interrelation between the prayer of Hezekiah and the word about the wicked in Isa. 57:1–13.29 The two texts are dealing with the destiny of an individual, a motif which appears rarely in the Book of Isaiah but which is important for the formation of the eschatological temple community. Isa. 38:9–20 emphasizes the death agony of king Hezekiah by pointing to the way he felt in the agony and highlighting that he cried for help to the LORD for the entire night (Isa. 38:13, 16). In contrast to this Isa. 57 describes the way of the infidels who could call the LORD but who ask idols for help (Isa. 57:13). Even if it seems that God
28 See, e.g., Sweeney, Isaiah 1–39, 504: “Hezekiah [. . .] presents a model of faithfulness to the Jewish community, assuring that trust in YHWH, expressed through temple worship, would see the community through its period of crisis.” The question remains how this kind of reading shall work since the king does not plead to God in the temple but in his palace, which does not exist anymore. 29 For the unit of Isa. 57:1–13 cf. Childs, Isaiah, 465. Former interpreters separated vv. 1–2 from vv. 3–13 but they had the problem to explain the function of vv. 1–2 in the context of Isa. 56:9–12 and Isa. 57:3–13. Childs reads the entire passage as a critique against leaders of the post-exilic community.

Wagner
will give up the faithful, they will rest in peace (Isa. 57:1–2). But the wicked will pass away without any honor. Those believing in God will inherit the land (Isa. 57:13). The differences between the two texts are apparent: Isa. 38 describes the agony of a king who survived, while Isa. 57 emphasizes the destiny of the wicked after the death of numerous faithful. Isa. 57 answers the question, who will belong to the holy community and inherit the land. And the answer is simple: those who are acting like Hezekiah and never give up faith in the LORD will inherit the land (Isa. 57:13) even if it seems that the faithful will die without any regard (Isa. 57:1–2).30 The basic opposition of this text is a change of respect towards the faithful. Hezekiah becomes one of these faithful, who already died but rests in peace.31 He serves as a role model for the members of the post-exilic community32 by keeping the faith even in his agony and by showing how to act in deepest personal doubts. What is missing in Isa. 57 is the royal perspective. The idea of the fall of the Davidic kingdom and the loss of kingship in Judah is described in Isa. 39 but is already marked in the prayer in a conspicuous wordplay.33 In Isa. 38:12 Hezekiah laments that his
דור was plucked up. In general, the term דור means ‘descent’ or ‘generation’, but not in this context. Due to the comparison the term describes the homestead of the king since the antecedent is כאהל רעי , ‘like the tent of a shepherd’. The term receives the meaning of a homestead,34 which is equivalent to the ‘house of the king’ or the dynasty.35 In the prayer Hezekiah describes the plucking up of his דור as happening during his agony.36 In the
30 O.H. Steck, ‘Beobachtungen zu Jes 56–59,’ BZ.NF 36 (1987), 235–6, emphasizes a radical change in post-exilic times, by which the topic ‘individual behaviour’ became striking for the author of Isa. 57. 31 Cf. the announcement of the prophetess Huldah in 2 Kgs 22:20. 32 Cf. Sweeney, Isaiah 1–39, 456. 33 Another indication for the critical position towards the Davidic dynasty is the missing of 2 Kgs 20:6 where God states that he will heal Hezekiah ‘for my sake and the sake of my servant David’. For the exclusion of this passage cf. Sweeney, Isaiah 1–39, 496–7. 34 Cf. H.S. Nyberg, ‘Hiskias Danklied Jes 38,9–20,’ in: G. Gerlemann (ed.), Festschrift Hans Kosmala (ASTI 9), Leiden 1974, 90, and Wildberger, Jesaja 28–39, 1460. 35 Later redactional additions point in various ways to the fall of the Davidic dynasty by using different images of homesteads. E.g. the author of Am. 9:11 calls the reestablishment of the house of David the raising up of the תכס דיוד (‘the hut [or tabernacle] of David’). להא is used to describe the homestead in texts dealing with the experience of agony in Job 4:21, 5:24, and 29:4. But in all cases the image is restricted to the term להא . The expression אהל רעי is unique in the Hebrew Bible. This might point to the tradition of David as shepherd as presented in 1 Sam. 17:34–6. 36 Cf. H. Wildberger, Jesaja 28–39, 1460: “Der Beter ist zwar noch nicht physisch tot, sieht sich aber faktisch durch seine zerstörerische Krankheit aus der Welt der Lebenden ausgeschlossen; die Perfekta sind also in Ordnung.”



From Salvation to Doom 103
retrospective of the post-exilic author the homestead of the king is already plucked up and the dynasty has fallen. With the prayer he highlights the relation of Hezekiah to the LORD and the impact of a faithful life for an individual as role model for believers in the post-exilic community. The situation of Isa. 57 as in the rest of the chapters 56–66 does not point to a unique historical event but to an eschatological formation of the holy community. With this modification the role of the prophet changes. Since he is the one heralding major historical events as effected by the LORD in First and Second Isaiah, he becomes a teacher announcing the destiny of individuals due to their faith and deeds.
5 Conclusions
The investigation of Isa. 36–39 shows that the Hezekiah story serves on various redactional levels with different functions, which means nothing else than that the message of the prophet was reinterpreted in several stages. At the beginning Isa. 36–37 serves to conclude the divine judgment against the Assyrian king. By merging First and Second Isaiah the aspect of the fall of the house of David was highlighted to interrelate the messianic announcements in Isa. 9 and 11 with the call of Cyrus as the LORD’s Anointed. Finally the Hezekiah story functions not only as the bridge between First and Second Isaiah but also as a connection between the times of the kings and the times of the postexilic temple community. The redactor’s adding Hezekiah’s prayer already looks ahead to the post-exilic era. Human kingship, even the Davidic kingship, is not a paragon for the post-exilic community, but a faithful person who keeps trusting in God even in the worst phases of his life. Moreover, it is an ideal role model for all believers, who are joining the community. The role of the prophet as a counterpart of the Davidic king finally got lost in the process of literary history for two reasons: 1. The king as receiver of divine words was changed to an ideal believer and a role model for later community members. His personal relationship to God is highlighted. He and (in the reception of his figure) the post-exilic community member possess a personal relationship to the LORD and they do not need the prophet to ask for intercession. 2. The message of the prophet changes. In the Hezekiah story and also in Isa. 44–45 he heralds future historical events, which are not conceivable for his counterparts. In Isa. 57 he outlines the divine acting towards the believers and the unbelievers in terms of an eschatological judgment. The leading question is the realization of divine righteousness less in terms of personal fate than in terms of true faith and right cultic practice. Thus the prophet’s image changes from a diviner heralding divine words to a teacher conveying true faith, its practice and the expectation of a future divine judgment against the enemies of the community.

Huldah: A Cunning Career Woman?
Blaženka Scheuer
Prophetess Huldah is one of five women in the Hebrew Bible referred to as nebîʾāh, and one of seven named prophetesses in the rabbinic count.1 Her single appearance in the Hebrew Bible is documented at a time of political insecurity that called for prophetic mediation. It is Huldah, not Jeremiah, who the Deuteronomists chose to authorize the words of the book of the Law, making Huldah the person who, in Claudia Camp’s words, ‘not only interprets but also authorizes the first document that will become the core of scripture for Judaism and Christianity.’2 The short account of Huldah’s background and prophecy is recorded in 2 Kgs 22:14–20 and again almost verbatim in 2 Chron. 34:22–28.The text is placed within the narrative about Josiah (2 Kgs 22–23:30), which in turn stands at the very end of the Book of Kings and thereby at the end of the Deuteronomistic History. The importance of Josiah has been widely discussed in scholarship, and the fact that Josiah is greatly idealized by the Deuteronomists (2 Kgs 23:25) is broadly acknowledged.3 The placement of Huldah’s oracle in the narrative about Josiah’s reform is significant: the oracle seems to be the factor that triggers Josiah’s extensive reformation of the cult (2 Kgs 23:1–24), thereby
1 The five prophetesses are Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, Noadiah and the unnamed prophetess of Isa. 8:3. Rabbinic sources account for seven prophetesses of the Bible among which Huldah is also mentioned: ‘Forty eight prophets and seven prophetesses prophesied for Israel’ (b. Megillah 14a). The seven prophetesses are: Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Huldah, Abigail, and Esther. Brenner refers to an alternative list which counts nine female prophets in the Hebrew Bible, adding Rachel and Leah, see A. Brenner, I am . . .: Biblical Women Tell Their Own Stories, Minneapolis 2005, 159. 2 C.V. Camp, ‘1 and 2 Kings’, in: C.A. Newsom and S.H. Ringe (eds), Women’s Bible Commentary: Expanded Edition with Apocrypha, Louisville 1998, 115.
3 For a detailed structure of the narrative about Josiah’s reign see M.A. Sweeney, King Josiah of Judah: The Lost Messiah of Israel, Oxford 2001, 41–45. Sweeney stresses the vital role of prophecy, and thereby the importance of Huldah’s prophecy, in the Deuteronomistic presentation of history: ‘prophecy is a major force in the historical presentation of the DtrH, in that prophets generally give voice to the DtrH interpretation of Israel’s and Judah’s history and to its overall theological viewpoint’, 180. See also M. Pietsch, ‘Prophetess of Doom. Hermeneutical Reflections on the Huldah Oracle’, paper read at the AAR/SBL Annual Meeting (Deuteronomistic History: Redaction of the Book of Kings Session), SBL 2007, available at http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/Michael_Pietsch.pdf, 2.

makingHuldahthemostimportantamongtheprophetsof theDeuteronomistic History.4 The main questions elicited by this text and discussed in biblical scholarship concern the history of the text on the one hand and the choice of Huldah over Jeremiah on the other. When and why was the text written, and why was Huldah chosen to deliver a message of destruction to Josiah? In the following, I shall give a short review of the answers proposed before focusing on the fate of Huldah after her appearance in the two biblical books asking: how was Huldah understood by subsequent readers?
1 The History of the Text
The oracle is generally divided into two parts: the oracle of judgment upon Judah and the people (2 Kgs 22:15–17), and the oracle of assurance or of salvation to Josiah (2 Kgs 22:18–20).5 Both parts are comprised of an answer to Josiah who sent his men to ask Huldah for prophetic clarification and guidance, or even intersession.6 Literary tension within the text, such as the juxtaposition of the oracle of judgment (vv. 15–17) with the oracle of salvation (vv. 18–20), has led scholars to conclude that the oracle has been extensively reworked by the redactors of the Josianic narrative.7
4 Thus, Tal Ilan concludes that ‘Huldah’s words to the king are a stock phrase of the Deuteronomist, used occasionally in the Book of Kings but shared only by Jeremiah. In the absence of Jeremiah himself from the Book of Kings, Huldah remains the single most powerful Deuteronomistic voice in it.’ T. Ilan, ‘Huldah, the Deuteronomic Prophetess of the Book of Kings’, Lectio Difficilior 1 (2010), 8.
5 These two oracles are chiastically structured; see, among others, Pietsch who argues for the literary uniformity of Huldah’s oracle on account of this structure which he sees as constitutive for the oracle; Pietsch, ‘Prophetess of Doom’, 3–4. 6 Sara Japhet, discussing the question of the nature of the oracle in 2 Chron. 34, argues that Josiah did not ask for guidance as much as for intercession, a nuance which can be seen in the rare use of the preposition beʿad, ‘for, on behalf of’, see S. Japhet., I & II Chronicles, London 1993, 1032. 7 For a recent brief review of scholarly discussion of the literary tensions within Huldah’s oracle, see M.A. Sweeney, King Josiah, 45–51. Some scholars have pointed out that Huldah’s oracle could be removed without disturbing the narrative about Josiah, a fact that indicates later editing. Thus Pietsch dates the oracle to exilic times and argues that it was included subsequently in an earlier narrative in the Book of Kings, see Pietsch, ‘Prophetess of Doom’, 6. For a different view, see N. Naʾaman, ‘The “Discovered Book” and the Legitimation of Josiah’s Reform’, JBL 130 (2011), 57, who dates the text to late pre-exilic times on account of the

One particular aspect in the text that complicates the discussion of the literary history of the oracle is the ambiguity of Huldah’s message to Josiah: ‘Therefore, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; your eyes shall not see the disaster that I will bring on this place’ (2 Kgs 22:20). On account of the similarity of the Hebrew phrase ‘to be gathered to one’s fathers in peace’ with Jer. 34:4 and 1 Kgs 2:6, Huldah was understood to be referring to Josiah’s death.8 The problem is obvious: Josiah did not die in peace, but died at the young age of 39 in a battle he himself pursued (2 Kgs 23:28–30), a fact that leaves Huldah’s prophecy, as it stands now, to be the only false prophecy of the Hebrew Bible.9 Whether one chooses to go this far or not, that Huldah was avoiding giving a straightforward answer to the king remains, a fact that raises a number of questions: Why would editors of this text let a prophet of Yahweh speak only half the truth to the king? And why would they leave Huldah’s potentially false prophecy undisputed? Some awareness of the problem among biblical authors later on is indicated by Chronicler’s version of Josiah’s story in which Josiah himself seems to be blamed for the un-fulfillment of this part of the prophecy (2 Chron. 35:22).10 Yet, it would be interesting to know how this ambiguity in Huldah’s prophecy
geographical location of Huldah’s home, the Western Hill in Jerusalem, which was important during the first temple period and completely neglected for a long time after 587 BCE. 8 Joshua would die while his kingdom was still intact. See, for example, commentary by M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, II Kings. A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (AB 11), New York 1988, 295. 9 Thus, Ilan, ‘Huldah, the Deuteronomic Prophetess’, 3. For further references on the issue of false prophecy, see op. cit., n. 2. See also W.C. Gafney, Daughters of Miriam: Women Prophets in Ancient Israel, Minneapolis 2008, 101–2. See also Cogan and Tadmor, II Kings, 295: ‘These words of Huldah remain a striking example of unfulfilled prophecy’. As an attempt to resolve this issue, it has been argued that the expression ‘be gathered to one’s grave in peace’ is connected to the burial rather than the death of the king. Thus Pietsch: ‘the meaning of the statement lies therein that Yahweh’s inevitable doom will not take place during Josiah’s lifetime; but rather, that the king has been spared the wrathful judgment of God on the grounds of his humility before Yahweh (cf. v.19)’; Pietsch, ‘Prophetess of Doom’, 5. The second part of 2 Kgs 22:20 could be seen as further corroborating this understanding: ‘your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring on this place.’ 10 Diana Edelman goes further in claiming that the Chronicler was trying to prevent this misinterpretation of Huldah’s prophecy as being false. D. Edelman, ‘Huldah the Prophet – of Yahweh or Asherah?’, in: A. Brenner (ed.), A Feminist Companion to Samuel and Kings, Sheffield 1994, 242, n. 1.

was understood by subsequent readers. What kind of a prophet was Huldah regarded to be and how was her message understood by an early readership? Before I turn to these issues, I will briefly review the scholarly answer to the second question: Why Huldah?
2 Why Huldah?
The fact that a woman prophet was chosen to be consulted on account of the book found in the temple is considered by most scholars a fact puzzling enough to be taken up for discussion.11 A number of interesting reasons for the choice of Huldah have been proposed. First, Huldah was a cult prophetess. Married to a temple official, she was probably involved in temple service as a prophet. Textual support for this view could be seen in the typically priestly phrase she used: ‘be gathered ( אסף ) to your fathers’.12 In addition, connected to the temple, Huldah would be more likely to be loyal to the king:13 She may have been connected to the royal court in a way Jeremiah was not, a detail that would make her an expected candidate for royal consultant.14 Second, Huldah was the most influential Deuteronomistic prophet of her day. She was aligned with the Deuteronomistic movement and was, therefore, a part of Josiah’s cult reform.15 Third, Huldah represents the interest of a certain group. Duane L. Christensen suggests that this group consists of the ‘men of Anatoth’, who
11 Scholars have pointed out the fact that Huldah’s message echoes a number of (male) voices, most prominently Jeremiah’s and Moses’ but also the voice of Solomon’s vision in 1 Kgs 9. See A.G. Auld, ‘Prophets Shared – but Recycled’ in: T. Römer (ed.), The Future of Deuteronomistic History, Leuven 2000: 25.
12 Thus, in a short note J. Priest, ‘Huldah’s Oracle’, VT 30 (1980), 366–68. 13 Gray, J., I & II Kings. A Commentary. London 1970, 726. See also Gwilym H. Jones, 1 and 2 Kings, Volume II: 1 Kings 1–2 Kings 25:30 (NCB). Grand Rapids, London 1984, 612, who finds it to be more likely that Shallum was working at the temple rather than the royal court on account of the reference to a similar official in the temple of Baal in 2 Kgs 10:22. Thus also Gafney, Daughters of Miriam, 103, who sees Huldah as a cult-prophetess due to the orthodoxy of her oracle. 14 This view is further corroborated by the parallels in Assyrian documents: see Tikva Frymer-Kensky in: Reading the Women of the Bible: A New Interpretation of Their Stories, New York 2002, 325. 15 Thus Ilan, ‘Huldah, the Deuteronomic Prophetess’, 10. Ilan argues that she was the prophet which the author of the Book of Kings chose in order to deliberately bypass Jeremiah. Jones sees a connection between Huldah and Deuteronomists in the reference to her neighborhood in Jerusalem, the Second Quarter, taken to be the expansion of Jerusalem towards the north where refugees from the Northern kingdom would have settled as well.

were critical of the social stratification in the society brought about by the monarchy.16 Restoring social justice – for women too – would be of importance to this group, just as it was for the authors of Deuteronomy. Fourth, as a woman, Huldah had both a cultural and a rhetorical importance demonstrated by the fact that Asherah-worship was associated with women, explaining why a woman’s voice of condemnation was required to abolish this practice. Only a woman prophet would be able to get the women to reform. In her message, nevertheless, Huldah functioned as ‘a “female alter ego” of Jeremiah.’17 All these suggestions come down to one basic idea: Huldah was chosen by the redactor of the Book of Kings/DtrH because she was a woman. First, women prophets were numerous in other ANE traditions and texts, particularly in Assyrian sources, and the fact that she was, through her husband, connected to the temple and/or royal court made her a legitimate prophet in spite of her gender.18 Thus Mari texts are particularly interesting due to the

McKinlay, ‘Gazing at Huldah’, The Bible and Critical Theory 1/3 (2005), 2., following Edelman, ‘Huldah the Prophet’, 243–50. McKinlay argues that if the worship of Asherah was a recognized feature of Israelite religion, as 2 Kgs 23:4–6 suggests, then employing a woman prophet to speak in favor of eliminating this cult is ‘part of a careful political writing’, 3. See also Edelman, ‘Huldah the Prophet’, 231–50. Renita Weems argues that the Deuteronomistic choice of a woman prophet has a significant rhetorical importance which lies in the assumed inferiority of women: ‘even a woman could see’ the importance of exclusive Yahweh worship, R.J. Weems, ‘Huldah, the Prophet: Reading a (Deuteronomistic) Woman’s Identity’ in: B.A. Strawn, N.A. Bowen (eds), A God So Near: Essays on Old Testament Theology in Honor of Patrick D. Miller, Winona Lake 2003, 335. In a similar manner, Judith McKinlay argues that Huldah ‘as a woman, has been used narratively to give voice to a theological template that justifies the silencing of the feminine aspect of deity’, McKinlay, ‘Gazing at Huldah’, 5. 18 M. Nissinen, ‘Gender and Prophetic Agency in the Ancient Near East and in Greece’, in: J. Stökl and C.L.

similarities with prophetic practices in the Hebrew Bible.19 Further, it has been suggested that the story of the finding of the Book of the Law displays similarities with stories in the ANE traditions, foremost Hittite and Mesopotamian texts. In some of these stories oracles would be required in order to proceed with major reforms undertaken by kings.20 In general, in ancient Israel’s cultural surroundings, women prophets were quite common and, in Huldah, DtrH found a candidate who fits the part perfectly. Furthermore, DtrH was familiar with traditions about Miriam, Rahab, Deborah, Hannah, and Abigail. Adding Huldah was a fitting end to the Deuteronomic history in which women have significant roles.21 Tikva Frymer-Kensky writes about Huldah:
The last prophet in the Deuteronomic history, she provides closure to the period of the occupation of the land (introduced by Rahab), to the monarchy (proclaimed by Hannah), and to the throne of David (proclaimed by Abigail).22
All these women function ‘as the agents of social transformation’, yet this time not in the realm of family affairs but in the realm of the Israelite history.23 Huldah marked the transition from monarchy to theocracy, from the time of
19 Huldah’s role in the Hebrew Bible for instance, would correspond to the role of Ᾱpiltu, a Mari category of court prophets who would provide a king with required answers from the deity; see Gafney, Daughters of Miriam, 53. Gafney also stresses the importance of the number of female prophets in Ninivite texts dated to the 7th century BCE., Daughters of Miriam, 50, 63–6. 20 See N. Naʾaman, ‘The “Discovered Book” and the Legitimation of Josiah’s Reform’, JBL 130 (2011), 55–62. See also L.K. Handy, ‘The Role of Huldah in Josiah’s Cult Reform’, ZAW 106 (1994), 40: ‘Josiah was double-checking the word of Yahweh because it was the proper manner of dealing in any type of cultic reform according to the norms of cultic literature in ancient Near East’; cf. also Cogan and Tadmor, II Kings, 284. 21 Thus H.G.M. Williamson, ‘Prophetesses in the Hebrew Bible’, in: J. Day (ed.) Prophecy and Prophets in Ancient Israel: Proceedings of the Oxford Old Testament Seminar (LHBOTS 531), London 2010, 70, 74, who points out the fact that Deborah and Huldah are placed first and last in the list of named prophets in the DtrH and concludes that female prophets must have been many although suppressed in the Hebrew Bible. 22 Frymer-Kensky, Reading the Women, 326. 23 Terminology borrowed from Frymer-Kensky, Reading the Women, 329, who discusses possible reasons for this Deuteronomic choice of women, see pp. 327–30. Studies of the prophetesses in the Hebrew Bible have frequently shown that narratives about women prophets have been placed in crucial phases of Israelite history. Thus, e.g., Frymer-Kensky, Reading the Women; Gafney, Daughters of Miriam.

the prophets to the time of Torah.24 In this process, the power and positions of men prophets is not endangered: the recognition for a job well-done would still go to Jeremiah. To sum up, the choice of Huldah over Jeremiah seems to be deliberate and quite understandable, yet the oracle attributed to her and preserved in the Hebrew Bible seems to be ambiguous and unique. To find out more about Huldah, I now turn to the representation of Huldah in later, inner-biblical and rabbinic tradition.
3 How was Huldah Read and Understood by a Later Readership?
The Hebrew Bible itself is not particularly negative towards Huldah and it does not make any active efforts to diminish her role. The diminishment of Huldah’s importance in the Hebrew Bible is more passive in character. In the final statements in both the Deuteronomistic and Chronistic accounts of history, male prophets – Jeremiah in particular – are referred to as being sent to predict a disaster for Judah. In one of the last reflective appraisals of the destruction of Jerusalem, the redactors of the Book of Kings declare: ‘He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord that he spoke by his servants the prophets’ (2 Kgs 24:2b). The prophet per se that spoke of this punishment is Huldah, yet she is not mentioned by name. Even though the masculine plural for prophets mentioned in the Hebrew Bible might include both genders, both Huldah as a person and Huldah as the prophet are obscured in the grammar of the scriptures which she declared as authoritative. It is worth remarking on the fact that the redactors of the Book of Kings, who made Huldah exceptional as the first prophet (and the only one in DtrH) to give authority to the written word as the word of Yahweh, did not acknowledge her importance in a more explicit way. In Wilda Gafney’s words, ‘Huldah’s case demonstrates both an apparent lack of gender bias on the part of the king and priests who consulted her (including the High Priest) and the appearance of bias on the part of the tradition preservers and shapers of the Hebrew Bible who did not conserve her broader oracular legacy.’25 On the other side, while
24 Cf. Naʾaman: ‘The reference to the “Book of the Law” in 2 Kings 22–23 may thus be interpreted as symbolizing the transition of authority from the prophet and the temple to the divine word embodied in the “Book of the Law” ’; Naʾaman, ‘The “Discovered Book” ’, 54. 25 Gafney, Daughters of Miriam, 102. Of course, the writers of the story of Huldah and the editors of the Book of Kings could be the same people. Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe this discrepancy. The fact that Huldah is defined as a wife of Shallum does not

we have seen that Huldah’s role as a prophetess was obscured by the grammar of 2 Kgs 24:2b, 2 Chronicles goes further: Huldah’s role is diminished and subdued, replaced by the prophet Jeremiah. In an appraisal of the destruction of Jerusalem, the Book of Chronicles concludes that the events occurred ‘to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah’ (2 Chron. 36:21 and again in the addendum in verse 22).26 Again, Huldah is left out of the history. Tradition takes on another prophet to promote.
3.1 Rabbinic Skepticism
The honor given to Huldah’s person and deed in rabbinic tradition is vast and in certain aspects unique.27 In Atalyah Brenner’s words, tradition gave Huldah an office within temple walls, two gates to the Temple Mount, and a grave in the Jerusalem hills.28 However, rabbinic literature had quite a decisive understanding of appropriate female roles. In their culturally-formed view, women should not speak in public at all – an understanding that raised particular complications when evaluating prophesying women. In the eyes of the rabbis, Huldah was primarily a woman and secondarily a prophet; her prophetic role was subdued as a result of her gender. The particularly negative tradition connected to Huldah and recorded in the Talmud (BT Megillah 14b) focuses on this very subject.
need to be seen as a diminishing factor. Studies have shown that lay female prophets are frequently presented as wives in order to ‘indicate their social accountability’, see Gafney, Daughters of Miriam, 69 citing A. Malamat, Mari and the Bible, Leiden, Boston 1998, 95–6. 26 See further D.A. Glatt-Gilad, ‘The Role of Huldah’s Prophecy in the Chronicler’s Portrayal of Josiah’s Reform’, Biblica 77 (1996), 16–31, and M. Grohmann, ‘Hulda, die Prophetin: (2 Kön 22, 14–20)’, Communio Viatorum 45 (2003), 209–16. 27 It is important to bear in mind the fact that the assessment of prophetess Huldah in early rabbinic traditions and writings is not homogenized. At the same time, systematic exposition of rabbinic understanding of Huldah is not possible due to the nature of source material which is, in Judith Baskin’s words, ‘characterized by a multivocal dialectical structure that preserves not only the definitive opinions of the majority, but also retains minority points of view.’ J. Baskin, Midrashic Women: Formations of the Feminine in Rabbinic Literature, Hanover 2002, 5.
28 For reference to rabbinic sources see Brenner, I am . . ., 159–62, 227. In like manner see A. Unterman, Dictionary of Jewish Lore and Legend, London 1991, 96: ‘She is the only person not of royal descent buried within the walls of Jerusalem, and after her death, she was put in charge of one of the women’s sections of Paradise.’ See also Baskin, Midrashic Women, 5: ‘. . . aggadic literature frequently preserves a more nuanced and complex view of women and their activities than the impersonal dictates of halakhic discourse.’

3.1.1 Megillah 14b
Having clarified the fact that Huldah’s credentials were based on her being married to the ‘right guy’ and having friends in high places,29 the rabbis went on to discuss the essentials of her character.
R. Nahman said: Haughtiness does not befit women. There were two haughty women, and their names are hateful, one being called a hornet and the other a weasel. Of the hornet it is written, And she sent and called Barak, instead of going to him. Of the weasel it is written, Say to the man, instead of ‘say to the king’.30
Louis Ginzberg further clarifies the above in two separate comments:
Megillah 14b. Here also it is remarked: Eminence is not for women; two eminent women are mentioned in the Bible, Deborah and Huldah, and both proved to be of a proud disposition. Deborah was haughty towards Barak (. . .) and the prophetess Huldah spoke of Josiah as the “man” (. . .) without giving him the title of king. This “unpleasant” feature of their character is indicated by their “ugly” names, the former was called Deborah “bee”, and the latter Huldah “weasel”.31
And again:
Megillah 14b. Here it is also stated: Pride is unbecoming to women; the prophetesses Deborah and Huldah were proud women (. . .) and both bore ugly names (Deborah = “bee” and Huldah = “weasel”).32
The rabbinic evaluation of Huldah is not based on her actions or on any doubt of her being a true prophet33 but, rather, the judgment is based on her gender. Huldah’s major and only fault was that she acted as a woman in a typically

male role. When women behave like this, their strength is seen as arrogance, their pride as haughtiness, and their eminence as presumptuousness.34 As a consequence Huldah receives an ugly, hateful name: a ‘weasel’.35 Yet, what does this really mean and why is ‘weasel’ considered an ugly name? This question is based on two assumptions. First, considering the fact that rabbinic writings such as this one were popular in character and oriented towards the daily life of those who were adhering to it, we must assume that such a depiction of the prophetess must have yielded specific connotations. What would these connotations be and what would a member of an audience or a reader of later times think of Huldah, the weasel? Second, these connotations would in turn influence the audience’s/readers’ understanding of Huldah and possibly bring in new meanings of the biblical story. If so, what would these understandings be? In order to answer these questions, I will proceed in three steps. First, I will examine the characterization of weasels within the rabbinic literature. Second, I will look into the Greco-Roman world and some specific texts that will help illuminate the image of weasels further, and, third, I will briefly return to rabbinic texts and end this inquiry with a new perspective on Huldah’s story in the Hebrew Bible.
3.1.2 Weasel: The Animal in the Rabbinic Sources There are two specific features of weasels discussed in the rabbinic sources which I wish to point out as relevant for the later readership’s understanding of the prophetess Huldah. These features are weasels’ cunning, and the peculiar view on weasels’ sexual reproduction.36 In the first volume of Ginzberg’s Legends of the Jews, the weasel is mentioned in a context of the account of creation: ‘[f]or every species on land, excepting
indicates that Huldah was understood to be a true prophet of Yahweh. See Edelman ‘Huldah the Prophet’, 242. 34 See also Baskin, Midrashic Women, 31–2. 35 The name Huldah is by all probability derived from the Hebrew root חלד , which is, in one of its two meanings, rendered as ‘dig, hollow out’. The Hebrew noun ḥolēd, referred to in Lev 11:29, is to be derived from the same root. The animal spoken of is probably a weasel, a mole or even a rat. See K.M. Beyse,’ ֶחלֶ ד cheledh’, TDOT 4: 397–9. For the animal in Lev. 11, see J. Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, Anchor Bible 3, New York 1991, 671. The Greek translation of the word in the Septuagint is γαλῆ. 36 Rabbinic writings are here represented by Ginzberg’s collection.

only the weasel, there is a corresponding species in the water.’37 The reason for this exception seems to be explained later on in the text:
The weasel is a cunning animal that learned from the fox. When God decided to send the Angel of Death to kill the animals by throwing them into the sea, the weasel tricked the Angel of Death into thinking that a representative of his kind has already been thrown into the sea. Therefore neither fox nor weasel is “represented in the water, while all other animals are.”38
Thus, the weasel, just as the fox who taught him the trick, used their cunning in order to escape the death sentence upon them, thereby tricking God himself. The other aspect of the animal taken up in rabbinic sources is connected to the way weasels procreate. In the same volume, in a context of the aftermath of the great flood, the text describes an incident where Noah curses ravens because a raven in the ark spoke spitefully against him. Noah asked the raven to go out and check the water level on earth. The raven refused to do so because he was convinced that Noah wanted him dead so he could take advantage of Mrs. Raven. Insulted by this appalling notion, Noah cursed the raven with an unnatural procreation:
“May thy mouth, which has spoken evil against me, be accursed, and thy intercourse with thy wife be only through it.” All the animals in the ark said Amen. And this is the reason why a mass of spittle runs from the mouth of the male raven into the mouth of the female during the act of copulation, and only thus the female is impregnated. Altogether the raven is an unattractive animal.39
In a footnote to this text in volume five, Ginzberg explains this peculiarity further:
37 Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, vol. 1, Bible Times and Characters: From the Creation to Jacob, Philadelphia 1988, 26. 38 Ginzberg Legends vol. 1, 40–41. Here the text speaks of a fox and a cat, yet in the footnote to this story Ginzberg states: ‘According to ancient sources (com. note 115), it is the weasel, which lives on the dry land, and if we want to be accurate, we ought to read “weasel” instead of “cat” in the text.’ L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, vol. 5, Notes to volumes I and II: from the Creation to the Exodus, Philadelphia 1987, 57, n. 188. 39 Ginzberg, Legends vol. 1, 38–39.

According to Barnabas, 10.8, it is the weasel which is impregnated through the mouth. This, however, inaccurately reproduces the statement of Aristeas 165, according to which the Bible has prohibited the enjoyment of this animal because it is impregnated through the ears and gives birth through the mouth. This widespread view is also mentioned by Aristotle in De Generatione Animalium, III, 6.5 who, however, scoffs at it.40
Even though the rabbis did not always keep their animals in order, the idea of the sexual oddity and repulsiveness of weasels is clearly demonstrated through the view on their unnatural manner of procreation: weasels are impregnated through the mouth/ears, and give birth through the mouth. These two main peculiarities of weasels – their remarkable cunning and sexual abnormality – are not generic to rabbinic texts but can be found in Greek mythology as well, in which, in all probability, the rabbinic stories about weasels originated.41 To these we now turn.
3.2 Greek Mythology
The link between women and weasels is ancient. In his extensive study of the subject, classicist Maurizio Bettini shows the width of popular belief and tradition connecting women and weasels throughout history, arguing that it all starts with the myth of Heracles’ birth.42
3.2.1 The Myth of Heracles’ Birth and the Story of Alcmena and the Weasel In Homer’s Iliad, we read about the circumstances of the great hero Heracles’ birth. Heracles is a child of Zeus and his earthly mistress Alcmena. The birth of the hero is as dramatic as could be expected. Dense with passion, strong emotions, and a great deal of pain, the story discloses the threat of death to the
40 Ginzberg, Legends vol. 5, 55, n. 177. 41 Jewish exegetes in the Hellenistic world were well aware of Greek traditions and mythology as well as of the ways to interpret it, in particular in Alexandria where Homer’s epics were studied. See M.R. Niehoff, Jewish Exegesis and Homeric Scholarship in Alexandria, Cambridge 2011. For the extent of the influence of Greek thought upon the view on women in post-biblical Judaism see, T. Frymer-Kensky, In the Wake of Goddesses: Women, Culture and the Biblical Transformation of Pagan Myth, New York 1992, 203–12. 42 M. Bettini, Women & Weasels: Mythologies of Birth in Ancient Greece and Rome, Chicago, London 2013. I am not going to attempt to establish a generic connection between this particular myth and the rabbinic text on Huldah. Rather, I see the connection as a strong influence of motifs and ideas which were well developed in different traditions of the Greco-Roman world.

unborn child and to a mother in labor. The story of agonized Alcmene about to give birth is a story that emerges from different accounts, meaning it does not exist in one complete version.43 For the purposes of this paper, I present the Roman poet Ovid’s later version of the story from his Metamorphoses, translated by Bettini. The story is narrated by Alcmene herself. As she was to give birth she encountered divine opposition. Because Alcmene was impregnated by Zeus, the goddess Hera, angry and jealous, instructed the goddess of childbirth, Ilithyia, to prevent the child from being born.44 As Alcmene endures the agony of hindered labor, our weasel-to-be, Galanthis, enters the scene:
One of the helpers (una ministrarum) came to me, a woman from the common folk, Galanthis, with fair hair, prompt in carrying out orders and whose services were much appreciated. She realized that this was happening because of immortal Juno, going frequently in and out of the room she saw the goddess seated on the altar, with her crossed fingers upon her knees. “Whoever you are”, she said to the goddess, “rejoice with my mistress! Alcmena of Argos has given birth and can now fulfill the vow she made as an expectant mother”. Lucina, the goddess of the womb, then leaped to her feet and, shocked, she opened the hands which she had been holding clasped together; meanwhile, my bonds were loosened, and I was freed of my burden. They say Galanthis started to laugh since she had deceived one of the gods. But the cruel goddess grabbed her by the hair as she was still laughing, and pulled her down and then kept her from getting back up again: her arms turned into paws. She still has her former zeal, and her color has not changed, but her shape is different from before: And because she used her deceitful mouth to help a woman give birth to a child, she gives birth through the mouth, and she continues to inhabit our houses, just like before.45
As a punishment for tricking the goddess, Galanthis was to be transformed into a weasel and would thus procreate through her cunning mouth. This story presents weasels as animals so deceptive that even gods can be tricked by
43 Bettini, Women & Weasels, 25, 45. 44 In this paper, Greek names for gods (Zeus, Hera, Eileithyia/Ilithyia, Heracles) are used, while Ovid uses corresponding Roman names (Jupiter, Juno, Lucina, Hercules). 45 The text is cited from M.

them, and so repulsive that they give birth through their mouths. Analyzing the story, Bettini shows how the weasel is used to characterize a cultural model of a laughing, cunning girl:
This young woman is sharp and canny, as the weasel is described in ancient fables and folklore. Ovid thus brings to life before our eyes a little weasel, swift and sure of itself, going in and out of ‘our’ houses (although that ‘our’ makes clear the cultural distance that divides us from Ovid), a creature who, oddly enough, supposedly gives birth through the mouth.46
Generally speaking, the idea of giving birth through the mouth is considered by most cultures of the time to be ‘unclean’, or at least unpleasant and repulsive. However, and what is interesting for the study of Huldah in such stories, this fact does not carry only negative connotations. In Greco-Roman tradition this idea of giving birth through the mouth is used also as a metaphor for knowledge, speech, and/or evidence of an interpretative mind. A couple of examples illustrate this fact. First, the Greek philosopher Plutarch, in his treatise on the myth and mysteries of Isis and Osiris, says that the oddity of the sexual reproduction of the weasel symbolizes knowledge which enters in through the ears and comes out through the mouth: ‘For as to the weasel, many still think and say that as it is impregnated through the ear and brings forth by the mouth, it is a likeness of the birth of reason (logos).’47 Second, in his elaborations on the theory on Evemerus and the question of the true nature of gods, Plutarch comments on the tradition about the Greek god Hermes: ‘For instance, the Egyptians tell us that Hermes had a short-armed body’.48 The expression ‘short-armed’ reads in
46 Bettini, ‘Laughing Weasels’, 211. 47 I am using here the older English translation by Mead simply because it is easily accessible. I am well aware of Brian P. Copenhaver’s warning for Mead’s ‘theosophical motivations’, although I doubt any such motivations will have impact on the particular texts I am referring to. See G.R.S. Mead, ‘Concerning the Worship of Animals, and Totemism’, in: Thrice-Greatest Hermes: Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis, Vol. 2-Sermons, London 1906, 356 (LXXIV:3). Accessed 10 June 2014.

Greek γαλι-άγκωνα, which can be translated as ‘weasel-armed’. In his comment on this text, Mead writes: ‘Now, as we are told further on (lxxiv. 3) that the weasel (γαλῆ), or marten, was fabled to conceive through the ear and bring forth through the mouth, this animal was evidently a symbol of mindconception. “Weasel-armed” may thus symbolise some faculty of the interpretative mind (Hermes).’49 Thus, Greek texts and traditions perceive weasels in the following manner: First, the characteristics invested in weasels (always female), i.e. confidence, efficiency, velocity and cunning, are used by her in order to trick a goddess or a god and thus save a life – her own or someone else’s. Second, the sexual oddity of the weasel is expressed by their procreation through the mouth. This idea once conceived lives a life of its own. The conception through (usually) the ear and the birth through the mouth symbolize the birth of reason (logos), of knowledge, and the expression of the interpretative mind. It is a divine ability to proclaim a divine message.
3.3 Back to the Rabbinic Readings and Audience
We have already seen that the rabbinic reading characterizes weasels as exceptionally cunning, generally distasteful, and sexually odd. The question is whether the symbolism of knowledge and divine inspiration which is found in Greek traditions have further influenced rabbinic understanding of the story of Huldah in 2 Kgs 22 and 2 Chron. 34. In rabbinic writings from Hellenistic contexts, there are traces of similar thinking concerning the symbolism of the weasels’ odd procreation. In the Letter of Aristeas, the High Priest elaborates on the reason and logic of the Mosaic food laws,50 according to which weasels are declared unclean and are forbidden to be eaten:
For you must not fall into the degrading idea that it was out of regard to mice and weasels and other such things that Moses drew up his laws with

Rajak, Translation and Survival: The Greek Bible of the Ancient Jewish Diaspora, Oxford 2009, 30–34.



Huldah: A Cunning Career Woman? 119
such exceeding care. All these ordinances were made for the sake of righteousness to aid the quest for virtue and the perfecting of character.51
The argument holds that the prohibition against eating weasels is philosophically and morally relevant. The weasels are declared unclean because they stand for a metaphor of hearing the word through the ear and speaking the word through the mouth. Interestingly, while Plutarch used the metaphor in a positive manner as a symbol of divine inspiration, Aristeas saw a symbolism of evil speech:
The species of weasel is unique: Apart from the aforementioned characteristic, it has another polluting feature, that of conceiving through its ears and producing its young through its mouth. So for this reason any similar feature in men is unclean; men who hear anything and give physical expression to it by word of mouth, thus embroiling other people in evil, commit no ordinary act of uncleanliness, and are themselves completely defiled with the taint of impiety. Your king’s action in removing such people – for so we are informed – is amply justified.52
However, there are examples in the rabbinic writing where the metaphor of procreation through the mouth is used in a positive sense. In rabbinic discussions on the question of male infertility, rabbis write that those among rabbinic men who cannot procreate for any reason (i.e. cannot have children) could instead procreate symbolically, through ‘insemination of Torah-knowledge and the production of disciples.’53 Knowledge of Torah is conceived through the ear and can be brought forth through the mouth in the form of rabbinic teaching which in turn will produce disciples: ‘Torah production, then, is a cultural equivalent of physical reproduction.’54

It is fair to assume that the Hellenistic cultural heritage and symbolic connotations connected to weasels would have been fairly well known to Jewish readers during the centuries around the turn of the Common Era. Connecting Huldah the prophetess to the weasels would trigger associations which were widespread in the Hellenistic and Jewish world. The early audience would understand the prophetess Huldah to be a clever woman who was cunning enough to trick Yahweh, and whose sexual oddity could be understood as divine inspiration aimed at the production of knowledge, and thereby possibly disciples. With these connotations in mind, I now turn back to the biblical text and ask: How would Huldah’s story in the Hebrew Bible be read and understood through these cultural lenses?
4 2 Kings 22 Once More
Huldah the prophetess seems to have been a highly successful career woman acting in a pivotal time in the history of Judah. In Megillah 14b, her professional accomplishments have been put aside on account of her gender.55 Being called a weasel is the punishment for stepping out of her gender-prescribed role in society. Interestingly, it seems as if this explicitly negative characterization of Huldah’s name in rabbinic writings was surpassed, and possibly suppressed by the cultural connotations connected to weasels in the Hellenistic world. Although unintended by the rabbis, the audience of rabbinic texts and teachings might have found another image of Huldah: Huldah as the weasel. I will illustrate this by exploring a new potential reading of the story of Huldah in 2 Kgs 22.
4.1 Cunning
In the same manner as the weasel of rabbinic writings having to face the Angel of Death, Huldah too had a threat of death to deal with. The death she faced as

she took the book in her hands was double sided. On the one hand, she herself was a part of the people she confirmed would be destroyed. On the other hand, King Josiah, who hoped for her compassion and prophetic ability to change things for the better, was a man powerful enough to have her killed, or at least to destroy her career, if he did not like what she had to say. What was she to do? What would the reader/the audience do? It is hardly an overstatement to say that her answer was canny: it will happen – but not in your time, O King! In other words, it will not happen in her time either. She too used her cunning, just as the weasel used hers to avoid the violent death hovering upon her, either through the judgment of God or by the hand of the king. In a like manner, Huldah’s cunning can be seen in the much debated ambiguity of her last words to Josiah: ‘Therefore, I will gather you to your fathers and you will be gathered to your grave in peace; your eyes shall not see the disaster that I will bring on this place’ (2 Kgs 22:20). The biblical redactors, as well as the audience, knew that Josiah died violently at Megiddo (2 Kgs 23:28–30). What exactly did her words mean? Is the king going to die in peace or is he going to be buried in peace? Could he die a violent death and then be buried in peace? Was Huldah a false prophet? The scholarly discussion of our time has been dominated by these very questions, which seem to have found a fairly convincing solution in the redaction critical outlines of the textual history of 2 Kgs 22. The problem of unfulfilled prophecy might yet be resolved in a different manner. Being collected to one’s grave in peace might be an expression of a cunning answer to a tricky and potentially dangerous question. The judgment will not happen in your lifetime, O King, you will die before it starts, and you will be buried as a king, in your grave, not elsewhere, you will be properly mourned, your bones will receive the royal rest – before the judgment comes. There was no escape route for the people, but there was one for the king. Such a prophetic assurance might very well have been the sign the king needed in order to gather strength and meet the mighty Egyptian army at Meggido. In other words, Huldah gave an ambiguous but agreeable answer to the king; it was an answer that left Josiah with the assurance that his final destination as a king – his royal grave – was to be a peaceful one. But the path to it was in his hands really.56
56 Given the fact that connotations connected to the weasels were a part of the cultural milieu long before the Hellenistic period and must have been known to the editors and redactors of the Book of Kings – and the Huldah episode in particular – it is not unlikely that the redactors of the Huldah text understood her prophecy as a particularly clever one. For sure, the risk of interpreting Huldah as the only false prophet of the Hebrew Bible would not escape their keen eye. Even so, the weasel connection brings in a new

4.2 Sexual Oddity
The sexual oddity of the weasels might have found a point of recognition in the fact that Huldah was understood to be out of her place. Instead of caring for her husband and her children, she was moving in a man’s world, operating on reason and speech – methods that were understood to be typically masculine.57 Now, as we have seen, sexual oddity, conceiving through the mouth, or rather ear, and giving birth through the mouth has both positive and negative connotations. The word – good or bad – is heard through the ear, is processed, and then spoken through the mouth. The analogy to the prophetic office is obvious: ‘The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain the weary through the word. Morning by morning he wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught. The Lord has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward’ (Isa. 50:4–5). Like a weaselarmed divine messenger, Huldah received the word from Yahweh and passed it on to King Josiah: ‘Thus says Yahweh.’ The rabbis acknowledge this through their criticism of her gender, not of her prophetic message. Interestingly, while attempting to diminish Huldah’s person through the eroticization of her mouth to the image of a weasel, the rabbis achieved the opposite and made Huldah into a woman who procreated through knowledge of Torah – a highly esteemed form of cultural reproduction, yet reserved for men exclusively.58 The commanding silence about Huldah in the Hebrew Bible might be a part of an attempt to keep her barren. The identification with weasels, though, made her abundantly fruitful: impregnated by the Word of Yahweh, Huldah, the woman prophet completely outside of her gender prescribed role, delivered through her mouth a message which on the one hand gave the king peace and, on the other, gave him strength to act as a great leader who had nothing to lose.
possibility of interpretation. I will explore these issues further, together with a study of connotations connected to Deborah’s name in my current work on Prophesying Weasels and Judging Wasps: Hebrew Bible Career Women in Early Rabbinic and Christian Sources. 57 H. Eilberg-Schwartz, ‘Introduction: The Spectacle of the Female Head’, in: EilbergSchwartz, Doniger (eds.), Off with Her Head!, 1. The sexual oddity of Huldah is also introduced through her lineage. In rabbinic texts she is a descendent of Rahab the Harlot. Tal Ilan argues that such lineage is a deliberate act through which the rabbis further discredit Huldah: ‘They cannot rid themselves of the notion that all women in the public eye, as righteous as they might be, are in some way always prostitutes (cf. b. Megillah 15a).’ Ilan, ‘Huldah, the Deuteronomic Prophetess’, 9. 58 See Eilberg-Schwartz, The Nakedness, 172, who shows that women in the rabbinic view were ‘excluded from the genealogy of knowledge’. Huldah seems thus to be an unintended exception. The audience could have hardly missed this irony.



Huldah: A Cunning Career Woman? 123
5 Conclusion
In Meggilah 14b the prophetess Huldah was rebuked and punished with an ugly name: a ‘weasel’. The connotations raised by the weasel-reference brought up images which were widely spread in the Hellenistic world. In both Greek and Jewish texts, two major connotations come to the fore: cunning and sexual oddity. Both these aspects influenced the later readership’s views on Huldah. Given the historical circumstances within the Josiah narrative, only a weasel-prophetess could be clever enough to protect, in one oracle, the integrity of both the deity, Yahweh, and the messianic king, Josiah. At the same time, the image of a weasel-prophetess seems to do away with the exegetical crux raised in biblical scholarship. Through her cunning, Huldah authorized the first Scripture and gave the king what he wanted, all while saving her career and her life. Through her oddity in gender and in agency, Huldah created posterity for herself. She might be content knowing that her few words preserved in splendid isolation in the Hebrew Bible have been transmitted throughout history, puzzling the minds of women and men for hundreds of years after their first delivery. In Huldah, therefore, later readership could see a woman whose ugly name turned out to be a disguise for an impressive legacy.

Rewriting the Past in Light of the Present: The Stories of the Prophet Jeremiah
Matthijs J. de Jong
1 Introduction
Studies of the narrative sections in the Book of Jeremiah usually start with the source model of Mowinckel, then turn to the redaction-critical models of Thiel, Pohlmann, Stipp, Albertz, and others, and finally add some new insights to the discussion. This contribution assumes a quite different starting-point, taking as its basis the words that are on a small lead strip, found at the site of the Oracle of Dodona in Ancient Greece:
God . . . Good Luck. About possessions and about a place to live: whether (it would be) better for him and his children and his wife in Kroton? (Side A) In Kroton. (Side B)1
A man, whose name remains unknown, asked the deity, Zeus of Dodona, a question. Would he and his family be better off in Kroton? On the reverse of the strip we find the clear answer he received from the god he consulted.2 The main point of this article is that we know what divination was about, and that we know what prophecy was about, and that it is time to use this knowledge to guide our critical analysis of the biblical prophetic books. For too long the exegetical study of the biblical prophetic books has been dominated by an ‘inner logic’, instead of being governed by an outwardly directed perspective. Studying the development of these texts without a proper

Eidinow, Oracles, Curses, and Risk among the Ancient Greeks, Oxford 2007, 76, no. 5. 2 Of the many lamellae (lead strips) found at the site of the oracle at Dodona, only a portion has been published (some 200 out of some 1,100), dating from 6th to 3rd cent BCE. All lamellae contain a private petition, a question posed to the deity that requires a clear and straightforward answer. In those cases where the answer has been written on the reverse, the answer is indeed straightforward. See F.G. Naerebout and K.

historically informed view of what prophecy entailed in the ancient world, is, in my view, like walking down a dead-end alley. The logic of divination on the other hand can function as a helpful outwardly directed perspective for improving the study of biblical prophetic literature.
2 Prophecy and Divination
2.1 The Function of Divination
The function of divination was to reduce uncertainty in life. Divination aimed to provide divine guidance when needed, that is, in uncertain situations, both private and public.
[D]ivination is the human action of production – by means of evocation or observation and recognition – and subsequent interpretation of signs attributed to the supernatural. These signs can be anything which the supernatural is perceived to place in the world with the intention to communicate, whether evoked or unprovoked, whether visible, auditory, tactile, olfactory or gustatory: in all cases the individual must recognize a sign as coming from the supernatural in order to consider it as a divinatory sign. Once this has occurred, the signs need to be interpreted whether this task is straightforward or difficult. This (culturally specific) interpretation produces a clear message.3 [T]he function of divination is to diminish uncertainty and although divination is future oriented, it is also concerned with past and present.4
Divination did not provide one with a blueprint of the future, but it diminished the fear of making the wrong choice which would lead to a negative future. It was, in other words, divine guidance to help one take the right course of action. No guarantees were given, of course. The anonymous man planning to go to Kroton was not guaranteed a happy and peaceful life. Perhaps he would anger a deity next day and lose a leg. Nobody knew. He only knew that at this very moment the god advised him to do as he had planned: to go to Kroton, and he most certainly felt reassured. Divination played a constructive, reassuring role in ancient society. It gave certainty to those in doubt in the face of a range of possible options. With

respect to political decision making, divination supported the stability of the state. In the words of Joel Sweek:
In the ancient Near East, as in many cultures, divination may be described as an assemblage of methods for ascertaining hidden knowledge necessary for the proper functioning of society. (. . .) the inquiry of diviners participates in the society’s central concern: the effort to secure the order and peace vital for its survival.5
2.2 Prophecy as a Form of Divination
This description applies to prophecy as well, which was, as we now realise, a form of divination.6 Prophets were supposed to take a mediating position between god and man, and the oracles they delivered were supposed to reflect decisions taken by the gods. In the ancient Near East we see prophets at work especially during times of national emergency, that is during wars, political crises and power conflicts. We see four basic types of message. (1) Prophets gave encouragement in times of emergency. Through the oracles, the gods gave the king and his people a declaration of their support. They granted their help, and promised victory and the destruction of the enemies. (2) Gods also used prophets to present their claims. We find divine claims for offerings, food for a banquet, and for property. After having given support, the gods expected generous gifts from the king. Furthermore, prophets could criticize the activities of the king and remind him of his duties.7 The gods were believed to control the king, and they could do so through the prophets. Prophetic oracles therefore sometimes contained reproaches directed against kings who failed to fulfil their duties. The purpose of such reproaches was to receive compensation for this neglect.8

(3) Prophets, in their role as guardians of the well-being of the state, a role they shared with the other diviners, could harshly denounce persons whom they perceived as posing a threat to the well-being of the state. This concerned not only external, but also internal enemies: people from within society whose actions or plans posed a threat to the well-being of the state. (4) A fourth function of the prophets was to announce the occurrence of disasters planned by the gods, with the purpose of averting them.9 In such cases, a god, it was believed, was angry because of some neglect or misconduct, and planned revenge. The announcement of this threat aimed to avert its outcome. If the right action was undertaken (a ritual, a prayer), the angry god(s) would be appeased and the evil averted. By announcing disasters, prophets did not stand in opposition to their society, but served the interest of king and state. If the predicted outcome was successfully averted, this did not make the prophecy false. On the contrary, that was the whole point of the divinatory intervention. To summarize, prophecy was part of a broader structure of divination and functioned within the existing order. Prophets spoke and acted for the benefit of social and cosmic stability. They were not necessarily pro-king (as the interest of the cosmic and social-political order could transcend the interests of an individual king), but they were always pro-state.10 No ancient Near Eastern prophet rejected the institution of kingship or announced the unconditional divine repudiation of his own state or society.11 Given the function of prophecy as part of the larger structure of divination this would have been unthinkable. We know the function of divination, as we know the logic behind it. And we should make use of this in our study of biblical prophecy. But first we must take one further step.
9 Negative apodoses to omens are formulated in the same way, ‘some disaster is going to happen’, but likewise with the purpose of averting the disaster, by performing an apotropaic ritual. Diviners were to ascertain whether an unfavourable consequence was foreshadowed, so that if this were the case, it could be averted. See S. Maul, ‘How the Babylonians Protected Themselves against Calamities Announced by Omens’, in T. Abusch and K. van der Toorn (eds), Mesopotamian Magic. Textual, Historical, and Interpretative Perspective, Groningen 1999, 123–129. For this aspect of prophecy in the context of divination, see L.-S. Tiemeyer, ‘Prophecy as a Way of Cancelling Prophecy – The Strategic Uses of Foreknowledge’, ZAW 117 (2005), 329–350. 10 Diviners were not passive ‘yes-men’ automatically supportive of the rulers. For the latitude and limitations of diviners, including the prophets, within the Mesopotamian societies, see Sweek, ‘Inquiring for the State’, 41–56. 11 Nissinen, ‘Das kritische Potential’, 30.

3 Prophecy in Literary Guise
When looking at the evidence from Mesopotamia and Ancient Greece, we find a clear difference between the practice of prophecy and other forms of divination on the one hand, and the way in which all of this is depicted in literary texts on the other.
3.1 Mesopotamia
For the Mesopotamian sources, this has not yet been studied systematically. However, it is clear that a process of ‘literary rewriting of prophecy’ has taken place.12 Examining the existing evidence, one can say that the examples relatively close to the actual oracles are concise, concrete messages, dealing with one issue, and of immediate relevance to the addressee, whereas the oracles in literary guise are extended, embellished, and broadened in time frame and scope. Although the ipsissima verba of the prophets are forever lost, I suggest that it is in the letters in which oracles are reported that we may get as close as we can hope to get to the original messages. And what we see, both in letters from Mari and from Neo-Assyrian times, is that the oracles reported in letters are concise, concrete, deal with one issue and are of immediate relevance to the addressee. A few examples may suffice here.13
(1) Oracle reported by Inib-šina (ARM 26 197)
The peacemaking of the man of Ešnunna is false: beneath the straw water runs! I will gather him into the net that I knot. I will destroy his city and I will ruin his wealth, which comes from time immemorial.
(2) Oracles reported by Mar-Issar (SAA 10 352)

Rewriting the Past in Light of the Present 129
You will take over the kingship. ... I have revealed the thieving polecat of my lord and placed it in your hands.
(3) Oracle reported by Nabû-reḫtu-uṣur (SAA 16 59)
This is the word of Nusku: The kingship is for Sasî! I will destroy the name and the seed of Sennacherib!
In the literary reworking of oracles, of which we find clear examples in the neo-Assyrian sources, the oracles were not only extended and embellished. We also see that the time frame is broadened. The situational perspective of the actual oracles makes way for an episodic perspective. The scope is broadened, and generalized. Various scholars, such as Martti Nissinen and Beate PongratzLeisten, have written on this, and earlier, I too discussed several examples of literary prophecy in detail.14 The developments we discern can be explained from the ex eventu factor. Afterwards, the course of events is clear. In hindsight it is evident what the gods in fact foresaw when they gave their advice and declared their support. In retrospect, everything is presented as if it happened by divine necessity: it had to go that way. Furthermore, the principle of ancient historiography that the winner takes all was applied in the reworking of prophecy too. To give one example: in the depiction after the event, the war between Assurbanipal and his brother Šamaš-šum-ukin is not described as a strife with an uncertain ending between two powerful men, but as a war between a god-fearing supreme king destined to win, and a sinful, godless contester, doomed to lose. It is all a black-andwhite situation, of life for Assurbanipal and death for Šamaš-šum-ukin. The whole course of events, including the divinatory practice that had guided it, was afterwards rewritten from the knowledge of the outcome, and from the perspective of the winner.
3.2 Greece
When we turn to ancient Greek sources, we find a similar picture. Here we find an even greater difference between the actual oracles on the one hand and the
14 See literature mentioned in note 12.



130 de Jong
way they are depicted in literary sources, such as in the Histories of Herodotus, on the other. This has been shown in several recent studies.15 The oracular standard people have in mind is heavily coloured by the famous examples of oracles from Delphi as presented in the Histories of Herodotus. However, these ‘oracles’ are clothed in a literary guise. If we forget for one moment what Herodotus writes and look at the epigraphical evidence and the Athenian law-court speeches, it becomes clear that the basic form of enquiries put to the oracle of Apollo was of this type: ‘Would it be more profitable and better for us to . . . .’.16 I will briefly mention one example, which is fully discussed by Hugh Bowden. When the Persian campaign against Greece started in 481 BCE, the Athenians realized that the Persians were determined to destroy their city, out of revenge for their part in the Ionian revolt and the battle of Marathon. So surrender was not an option, and the Athenians planned to leave their city and to rely on their fleet. Abandoning the city in the certain knowledge that it was going to be destroyed was not only a hard decision, but it also meant abandoning the temples of the gods, and this could not be done without divine permission. A consultation of the Delphic oracle therefore was necessary.17 The usual form of query put to the Delphic oracle was ‘Would it be better and more profitable for us to do so-and-so?’ This was very much like the kind of question put to the oracle of Dodona. The questions normally received a straightforward answer.18 The Athenians thus asked the god: ‘Would it be better and more profitable for us to abandon our city, and take to the ships?’19 In response, they received the divine approval for doing what seemed best to them: to embark on the ships and leave their city. Apart from a general probability that the question put to the oracle was of this type, there are several more specific indications supporting this view. One later author, referring to earlier, fourth-century BCE accounts, states that ‘the oracles said that it was more profitable for the Athenians to leave their

16 Bowden, Classical Athens and the Delphic Oracle, 23–24 and 33: ‘a man asked a woman a question, and the woman answered. All the other aspects of Delphi, including the literary tradition that grew up about the oracle, serve, deliberately or not, to obscure this central simplicity’.

Rewriting the Past in Light of the Present 131
native land and embark on their ships.’20 Furthermore, an analogy with the city of Delphi also points in this direction: somewhat later, with the advance of the Persian army, the citizens of Delphi found themselves in a similar situation. Preparing to abandon their city, they asked Apollo’s permission to depart (and to leave the temple treasures largely unprotected), to which Apollo gave his consent. To the Athenians, two options were left: either to flee or to fight at sea. The Athenians chose the second, undoubtedly supported by good portents and divine approval. Their decision to fight the Persians at sea was to become a crucial moment in the Persian war. They defeated the Persian naval forces at the sea battle at Salamis. This victory was one of the major events that eventually changed the course of the Persian campaign for the worse. In the Histories of Herodotus (Histories VII–VIII), written some decades after the events, the answer of Apollo of Delphi is not simply a ‘yes’ any more, but now consists of two pieces in hexameters of twelve lines each. In these texts, the whole sequence of events – involving the abandonment and subsequent destruction of Athens, the Greek reliance on the ships, and the victory at sea at Salamis – is referred to. As often in Herodotus the prophecy functions as a plot-driver. Cited at the beginning of the episode, the predictions are fulfilled one by one as the story unfolds.21 Herodotus furthermore attributes the right understanding of the so-called prophecy to Themistocles, the hero of this episode. Herodotus presents the whole episode from the particular perspective of hindsight, namely to illustrate that the Persian defeat was according to the will of the gods, and was achieved by the bravery of the Athenians lead by Themistocles. Herodotus used these two pieces of a literary oracle as the kernel around which he masterfully wove his story. For a long time, commentators have suspected that this literary oracle is an ex eventu piece of work, and they are likely to be right. However, it seems unlikely that Herodotus himself invented it. Hugh Bowden now offers a fruitful suggestion: it may well have been the oracle of Delphi itself that, after the events, published this written prophecy, not as a fraud, of course, but in order to show what Apollo in fact foresaw correctly when he gave his consent to the Athenians to abandon their city and to rely on their fleet. Afterwards, it was clear that all had happened by divine necessity, and afterwards, the true implications of Apollo’s ‘yes’ could be explained and extended. And this was done,

132 de Jong
says Bowden, by the Delphic oracle itself, in order to demonstrate the authority of the oracle – a form of ancient advertisement.
3.3 Conclusion
Both in the Mesopotamian and in the Greek sources we find a similar phenomenon: after the events there followed a rewriting of prophecy. After it has become clear what the gods implied with their message, the message could be spelled out and extended. Thus we see a clear distinction between ‘prophecy in practice’ and ‘prophecy in literature’. With this distinction in mind, we will look at the Jeremiah stories.
4 Stories of Jeremiah
4.1 Two Different Perspectives
I will focus on the narrative material concerning Jeremiah that relates to the reign of Zedekiah (i.e. Jer. 20:1–6, 21:1–10, 27–29, 34:1–6, and 37–38). In these stories, we find two different messages with regard to the fate of Judah and Jerusalem, both attributed to Jeremiah. The dominant line states that the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem is inevitable. Yahweh is determined to let this happen, due to his anger with the wickedness of the people. Nothing can be done to avert this threatening fate. This is demonstrated by Jer. 37:10.22
Even if you defeated the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men in their tents, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.
Yet, there are also clear traces of a different prophetic message, namely that Judah’s survival was possible; it depended on accepting Babylonia’s supremacy. According to this message, resistance to the Babylonians was against Yahweh’s will: it would bring death and destruction. The disasters, however, could be prevented. Accepting Babylonia’s supremacy was acting in accordance with Yahweh’s will, and would lead to survival. This message is found in several chapters:
Chapter 27: ‘Serve the king of Babylon and live’ (27:11, 12, 17) Chapter 21 and 38: ‘Surrender to the Babylonians and live’ (21:9, 38:2) Chapter 29: ‘In Babylon’s welfare you will find your welfare’ (29:7)
22 Biblical texts are cited here according to the NRSV.



Rewriting the Past in Light of the Present 133
Chapter 34: If you submit to the Babylonians, you, i.e. Zedekiah, shall die in peace and receive royal burial honors (implied by 34:4–5)23 Chapter 38: ‘If you, i.e. Zedekiah, surrender to the Babylonians, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live.’ (38:17)
We encounter two different perspectives on the destruction of Jerusalem, both attributed to Jeremiah.24 According to the one, Jerusalem’s destruction is something that can and should be prevented by taking the right course of action. According to the other, due to Yahweh’s decision Jerusalem has to be destroyed as a divine necessity. The first message depicts Jeremiah as operating ‘pro-society’, seeking Judah’s survival; the second portrays him as a classical prophet, a mouthpiece of Yahweh’s irrevocable ‘No!’ to his people.25 Various commentators have noted these two different perspectives. Some of them, such as Christopher Seitz, and William McKane, have even defended the redaction-critical position that in my view is the right one,26 namely that the earliest stratum presents Jeremiah as aiming at the survival of Jerusalem and Judah (Seitz calls this the Scribal Chronicle), whereas a reworking of this, now the dominant line in the stories, has given a decisive twist to it (Seitz calls this the Exilic redaction). Although I consider these studies as of great importance, I want to press a different argument here. The first part of this contribution provides a perfect
23 For these verses, see C.R. Seitz, Theology in Conflict: Reactions to the Exile in the Book of Jeremiah (BZAW, 176), Berlin 1989, 250–51. 24 Seitz offers an analysis of these two perspectives, distinguishing between a ‘Scribal Chronicle’ and an ‘Exilic Redaction’, Seitz, Theology in Conflict, 203–291, esp. 239, 246, 250, 262, 290. 25 These two perspectives cannot be harmonized by the suggestion that the former was Jeremiah’s initial message that at some stage was overruled by the latter, since 38:17–18 presents Jeremiah at the brink of the Babylonian takeover as still delivering the message that Jerusalem’s destruction can be prevented (see also Seitz, Theology in Conflict, 239). Moreover, in other passages Jeremiah is portrayed as a spokesman of Yahweh’s irrevocable ‘No!’ from the very outset of his prophetic career. 26 My position basically resembles Seitz, Theology in Conflict. Seitz however does not deal with the divinatory context, and his position on Jeremiah’s preaching before 598 BCE is in my view unconvincing. Other authors have noticed the two different perspectives within the Jeremiah material too: W. McKane, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Jeremiah (2 vols; ICC) Edinburgh 1986–1996, 2:875–877, 965–966, 971, and R.P. Carroll, Jeremiah: A Commentary (OTL), London 1986, 641–43.



134 de Jong
explanation for the two different perspectives in the stories. One of them mirrors actual prophetic activity, the other is another example of the ex eventu rewriting of prophecy. The message that the people should accept Babylonia’s supremacy in order to survive portrays Jeremiah as a prophetic figure striving for the survival of his society. He neither foretold nor intended the destruction of his country. Instead, he acted as was expected of a diviner: he revealed the divine will with regard to a matter of major importance in order to provide the information necessary for the political decision-makers to act wisely to secure the common welfare. The second perspective results from a reworking. At a later stage, the messages attributed to Jeremiah were modified, and Jeremiah was turned into a mouthpiece of the inevitable destruction of Judah and Jerusalem. In this way, he became a figure foretelling total destruction that could not be averted. This later reworking of the earlier oracles corresponds to the reworking of prophecy we see in Assyria and Greece.
4.2 Prophetic Messages in a Historical Situation
Let us first have a closer look at the earliest traditions that present Jeremiah as a figure supporting his society. This tradition is preserved as some sort of substratum in the narratives.27 The traces that remain relate to the reign of Zedekiah, partly to the time before the revolt against Babylonia,28 and partly to the years of the revolt and the siege of Jerusalem (in 588–586 BCE).29
(1) The early tradition as preserved in chs. 27–29 relates to the time before the revolt. The earliest parts of these chapters – as argued by various critical studies30 – present a coherent picture.31
27 Jer. 20:1–6*, 21:9, 27–29*, 34:4–5*, 37–38*. 28 Jer. 28:1 mentions the fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign (circa 594 BCE).
29 For the chronology, O. Lipschits, The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah under Babylonian Rule, Winona Lake 2005, 72–75. 30 A nucleus of these chapters may have consisted of Jer. 27:2–4.11, 28:2–4*.11, 13–15* and 29:1.3–7*, 25–28*. For this reconstruction, see McKane, Jeremiah, 2:695–708, 716725, 735–748; A. Graupner, Auftrag und Geschick des Propheten Jeremia.

Rewriting the Past in Light of the Present 135
First, the message not to revolt against Babylonia is symbolically acted out by Jeremiah, by a yoke he put on himself (27:2–4, 11). Jeremiah, as ordered by Yahweh, walks around with a yoke of straps and bars on his neck, and publicly delivers the following accompanying message: ‘Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.’ This is his message for Zedekiah and the people of Judah. He has a similar message for the royal envoys from Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon, that were gathered in Jerusalem at the time: ‘Any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, says the LORD, to till it and live there.’ The idea is, that Yahweh has granted the Babylonians supremacy, and that submission to them leads to survival and well-being. In response to Jeremiah’s oracle, the prophet Hananiah delivers a contradictory oracle. He announces that Yahweh will break the yoke of the Babylonian king. Hananiah takes Jeremiah’s yoke, and breaks it, saying: ‘Thus says the LORD: This is how I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years’ (28:11). Jeremiah, in turn, counters Hananiah’s oracle, by proclaiming: ‘Thus says the LORD: You have broken wooden bars only to forge iron bars in place of them!’ And with respect to Hananiah, he announces: ‘Within this year, you will be dead’ (28:13, 16). Subsequently, in ch. 29, we find a letter from Jeremiah to the Judean community in Babylonia. In this letter, he informs them of the following oracle:
4 Thus says the LORD (. . .) 5 Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. 6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage (. . .), multiply there, and do not decrease. 7 And seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.
This letter receives a furious reaction from Shemaiah, one of the Judeans in Babylonia (29:25–28*); he wants Jeremiah to be silenced. And once again, Jeremiah declares that it is the word of Yahweh that Shemaiah will die. These traditions form a coherent picture: Jeremiah announces, in word and deed, that Babylonia will prosper and stay in power. Judah’s chances of survival therefore depend on accepting Babylonia’s supremacy. For the Judean community in Babylonia this means that they must find their well-being in Babylonia’s well-being.

The message is countered, in both cases. Hananiah breaks the yoke and delivers a contradictory message and Shemaiah writes a furious response to Jeremiah’s letter. In both cases, an oracle spoken by Jeremiah, announcing a terrible personal fate for his opponent, concludes the scene.32
(2) Now, let us turn to the early tradition that relates to the time of the revolt and the siege of Jerusalem, found in chs. 37–38.33 The earliest parts of these chapters (37:11–21 and 38:14–28, and to some degree in 38:1–13) as argued by various critical studies,34 confirm the picture we already had already seen. These stories about the final stage of Judah’s monarchy depict Jeremiah as announcing that surrender to the Babylonians will lead to survival. Even during the revolt Jeremiah urged the king to surrender to the Babylonians in order to stay alive, and to save Jerusalem from destruction, in Jer. 38:17:
Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If you will only surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.
But the message was rejected. In these stories, Jeremiah is treated as a traitor, an enemy of the state. But let us put this into the right, historical, perspective. Many of the Judeans in fact regarded submission to Babylonia as the better choice.35 Many of them had fled to the area of Benjamin, where the Babylonians probably already had installed a seat of government in Mizpah with Gedaliah as their appointee.36 These Judeans had in fact acted upon Jeremiah’s message: surrender to the Babylonians in order to survive. When Jerusalem was under siege, it was isolated from the rest of the country. Those remaining in the city, led by the king and the political leaders, persisted in the revolt. It was these particular circumstances that put Jeremiah in a dangerous position. From the perspective of the revolters, he was an enemy
32 Just as in Jer. 20:1–6*. 33 And furthermore in Jer. 21:8–10* and 34:4–5*. 34 McKane, Jeremiah, 2:932–945, 962–971; Lipschits, Fall and Rise, 76–77, 93–94, 316–325; Seitz, Theology in Conflict, 238–241, 272–73. 35 During the first revolt (599–597 BCE), after Jehoiachin had ascended the throne, the surrender to the Babylonians had secured the survival of the state and the royal house. During the second revolt (589–586 BCE), Jeremiah’s messages supported those who tried to achieve a similar result. For a reconstruction, see Lipschits, Fall and Rise, 70–88. 36 Lipschits, Fall and Rise, 88–97.

of the state, because his message undermined the belief in the success of the revolt. This period was the cradle of the stories about the imprisonment and the attempts to kill Jeremiah.37 Here the image of Jeremiah as a suffering figure probably has a historical basis. At a later stage, this was taken as paradigmatic for Jeremiah’s ministry as a whole. Ex eventu, he became portrayed as a figure against society, whose adversaries not only were the leaders of the revolt, but Judah’s society at large. In historical terms, however, part of Judah’s population, including members from the highest circles such as Gedaliah, had heeded Jeremiah’s message.38 This is the picture as presented by the early Jeremiah tradition.39 I do not want to claim that this picture is purely historical. I do want to claim, however, that the early tradition probably mirrors actual prophetic activity during the final years of Judah’s political existence. At that time, the main issue was whether to submit to Babylonia’s supremacy or to resist. Both options had their advocates among the Judean leadership, and both had religious implications. Resisting Babylonia needed the divine assurance that Yahweh would protect his people against the enemy threat, whereas submitting needed divine permission. Jeremiah’s messages were immediately relevant to the actual situation, as they provided the divine consent for submission. Jeremiah revealed that Yahweh had granted the Babylonians supremacy, so that to act according to Yahweh’s will was to accept the Babylonian rule. From this perspective, the real threat to Judah’s well-being did not come from the Babylonians, but from those Judeans propagating resistance contrary to Yahweh’s will. Before the revolt, Jeremiah urged Zedekiah and the Judeans not to rebel; for the Judean community in Babylonia, his message was: ‘You will find well-being in Babylonia’s well-being’. During the revolt, his message to the people was: Leave Jerusalem, surrender to the Babylonians, and you will stay alive; for the Jerusalem leadership it was: Hand over the city to the Babylonians in order to prevent death and destruction. These messages had an immediate relevance, as did all oracles in the ancient world. Jeremiah acted as a prophetic figure in support of society, consistent with the practice of ancient divination.40
37 Seitz, Theology in Conflict, 256–257; Lipschits, Fall and Rise, 76–77, 93–94, 316–325. 38 E.g. Lipschits, Fall and Rise, 77, 84–88, 94. 39 The same message again occurs in the Gedaliah story (Jer. 40:7–41:18), in which Jeremiah does not play a role. Gedaliah repeats Jeremiah’s message, as part of an oath (Jer. 40:9), ‘Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall go well with you.’ For the Gedaliah episode, R. Albertz, Israel in Exile. The History and Literature of the Sixth Century B.C.E. (trans.

4.3 The ex eventu Reworking
The destruction of Jerusalem proved that Judah’s leaders had made the wrong decision. Afterwards, it was strongly felt, at least in some circles, that Jeremiah’s message had been true and should have been acted upon, and Jeremiah was vindicated as the spokesman of the true word of Yahweh. At this stage, the prophecies attributed to Jeremiah were of course understood from the new reality. After the downfall had become a fact, the oracles and stories of Jeremiah acquired a new meaning. Originally his message was intended to prevent the downfall, as we may safely conclude from our insight into the logic of divination. Afterwards however, those who guarded the Jeremiah tradition believed they saw the true meaning of Jeremiah’s words, namely that the fall was something that had happened not by mistake or by misfortune, but by divine necessity because of the disobedience of Jeremiah’s contemporaries, who had refused to listen to him. The simple line, ‘submit to the king of Babylonia, and live’, acquired a second layer: but because you refused to do so, Yahweh has decided to destroy you. This is the logic as found in ch. 38:17–23, where 22–23 in fact anticipate the wrong choice by Zedekiah. Similarly, and more clearly, this is the logic in ch. 42, where the ‘leftovers’ of Judah are compared with the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with regard to the choice they have: submit to Babylonia and live. But since they do not obey, and have decided to go to Egypt, they will be destroyed by Yahweh. All this is part of the same ‘prophecy’, clearly consisting of two layers. The explanation for the destruction was: Yahweh had decided to punish his people because of their sinfulness. This motif, ‘due to divine anger’, was, in fact, the typical ancient Near Eastern explanation for historical calamities.41 So the earlier prophecies were rewritten, from the fact of the destruction, and from the insight that it was a divine punishment for the sins of the people. The reason why the prophecies were rewritten is easy to see. In their original form, they had become irrelevant. Their true meaning, from the ex eventupoint of view, had to be made explicit. The exilic reworking of the Jeremiah tradition pointed out that Judah’s society had failed in its entirety, including the prophets and priests. Judah as a whole was destroyed, because Judah as a whole had sinned. It was furthermore
41 In the ancient Near East ‘calamities are conceived as divinely contrived punishments’; K. van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction in Israel and Mesopotamia: A Comparative Study (SSN, 21), Assen 1985, 56. For an example, see M.J. de Jong, ‘Biblical Prophecy – A Scribal Enterprise: The Old Testament Prophecy of Unconditional Judgement Considered as a Literary Phenomenon’, VT 61 (2011), 55–56.



Rewriting the Past in Light of the Present 139
emphasized that Yahweh time and again had announced this to happen, and Jeremiah became portrayed as the mouthpiece of this irrevocable punishment. Not only was the message rewritten, but also the messenger. From a prophetic figure aiming at Judah’s survival, Jeremiah became the proclaimer of the inevitable destruction of his society in its totality. At the same time, Jeremiah’s opponents were reframed as liars and deceivers. The uncertainty of the present, where one prophetic message was contradicted by the other, where one could only hope to have made the right choice, all this made way for a clear-cut, black-and-white certainty: Jeremiah was the only true mouthpiece of Yahweh, his opponents, now ‘the prophets’ as a collectivity, were simply deceiving liars. It was all crystal clear, and Jeremiah’s contemporaries were seen as ignorant because of their lack of understanding, and evil, because of their refusal to listen to Jeremiah’s words.42
5 Conclusion
Prophecy as divination had a direct relevance to the current situation, and often took the form of divine guidance vis-à-vis a proposed course of action. The oracles provided the guidance the recipients needed in order to confidently take the course of action that seemed the best way to victory or survival. The oracles were an indispensable part of the political decision making. The sources also confront us with a literary kind of prophecy. Literary prophecies are marked by an episodic perspective instead of the situational perspective of actual prophecy, and by a black-and-white perspective of good and bad. Once the outcome is known, the uncertainty that surrounds all human decisions has gone. In retrospect, Assurbanipal was described as the beloved of the gods, whose position could not be threatened; Šamaš-šum-ukin was merely a wicked criminal, whose terrible fate, sealed beforehand, was turned into an example for any future enemy. After the victory at Salamis it was clear that the Athenians’ decision to abandon the city and rely on the fleet had been the right one. By then it was
42 During the exilic period a textual complex began to take shape that may be called the written Jeremiah-tradition. Scribes incorporated existing materials, such as the ‘early traditions’ presented earlier. M.J. de Jong, ‘Why Jeremiah is not among the Prophets: an analysis of the terms נביא and נביאם in the Book of Jeremiah’, JSOT 35 (2011), 500–508; K. van der Toorn, Scribal Culture and the Making of the Hebrew Bible, Cambridge MA 2007, 188–194.

clear what Apollo had foreseen when he granted the Athenians permission to leave their city. For Herodotus, Themistocles was the hero: thanks to him, the Athenian fleet had been enlarged earlier on, and he had been the successful leader of the battle at sea. For this reason, Herodotus depicted Themistocles as the only one who before the events had understood the right meaning of the ‘prophecy’ from Delphi. Those taking an opposite view are depicted as a bunch of poor interpreters and cowards. After the event, everything is described as having happened with divine necessity. The literary prophecies bear relevance for later readers, instead of the original addressees of the message. The reworking of prophecy was not seen as manipulation or fraud, but simply as the making explicit of what was already implicit in the original oracles. The outcome of the events, it was held, had already been seen by the gods, and it happened as they decided. In one important respect the rewriting of Jeremiah’s oracles differed from the rewriting of the Assyrian and Greek oracles. In contrast with the latter two, the divine guidance provided by Jeremiah was not heeded by Judah’s main political decision-makers. The message was proved right in the end, but what his message was designed to prevent did happen: Jerusalem was destroyed and the state of Judah abolished. This required a twist in the literary version of Jeremiah’s message. The divine foreknowledge allegedly implied in Jeremiah’s oracles was the insight that the divine guidance would not be heeded, and that, for this reason, Jerusalem would not survive, and the state of Judah would come to an end. The literary version thus included the notion of rejection of the message, and its fatal consequences. But to call this a twist is, of course, our modern, critical perspective. For those who kept alive the Jeremiah tradition it was not a twist at all. For them it was crystal clear, what from the outset had been the true meaning of Jeremiah’s oracles, and they diligently spelled out this true meaning in the expanding Jeremiah-corpus. They shaped the image of Jeremiah as a figure prophesying utter doom for a disobedient and evil society, driven by the sincere belief that this was the true meaning and the enduring relevance of the words of God that Jeremiah had spoken.

King Asa and Hanani the Seer: 2 Chronicles 16 as an Example of the Chronicler’s View of Prophets and Prophecy
Pancratius C. Beentjes
1 Introduction
It is beyond any doubt that the author of the Book of Chronicles, henceforth referred to as ‘the Chronicler’, has left his particular mark(s) on the narrative about King Asa as it was found by him in 1 Kings. There are several clues to substantiate this claim.1
• First, whereas 1 Kgs 15:9–24 runs to a total of sixteen verses, the Chronicler’s
account fills no less than forty seven verses (2 Chr 14:1–16:14).2
• Second, the Chronicler’s narrative has a remarkable structure. Whereas
2 Chronicles 14–15 at great length describe the positive aspects of Asa’s kingship over thirty four years, in Chapter 16 – which by the way fills a remarkably short period of seven years –, the negative sides of this king are brought to the fore.
• Third, in 2 Chronicles 16 the Chronicler has adopted the sequence of the
verses as handed down in 1 Kgs 15:17–24. However, already at first glance one can observe that he has remodeled it in order to create a new text of his own, as can be demonstrated in the following chart:
1 This traditional point of view, however, is questioned by a group of scholars putting up a case for the view that Chronicles does not depend on Samuel-Kings, but that both are rewritings of an older common source. And even the question is posed whether or not there might have been an expansion or, what’s more, a re-editing of the Book of Samuel and the Book of Kings in the times of the Chronicler or even afterwards. See, e.g., G. Auld’s contribution to this volume, and U. Becker, H. Bezzel (eds), Rereading the relecture? The Question of (Post)chronistic Influence in the Latest Redactions of the Books of Samuel (FAT 2. Reihe 66), Tübingen 2014.

• Fourth, both in the positive and in the negative part of the Asa narrative the
Chronicler has inserted addresses by prophetic figures who elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible are completely unknown. A prophecy by a certain Azariah son of Oded is found in 2 Chr 15:1–7, whereas in 2 Chr 16:7–10 a seer called Hanani is addressing King Asa. In both of these episodes we come across the Chronicler’s most significant theological signature(s).
2 2 Chronicles 16
For several reasons, the narrative of 2 Chronicles 16 appears to be a good example to demonstrate in what way the Chronicler brings his political and theological intentions to light. More specifically, Hanani’s speech appears to be a fine example of the Chronicler’s method of working and his theology. Attention will be paid to the structure of his address, its context, and some of its connection threads. This episode is structured into three parts:
(1) 16:1–6 The alliance of Asa and Ben-Haddad against Baasha (2) 16:7–10 Disapproval by the seer Hanani (3) 16:11–14 The final years of Asa; peculiarities relating to his funeral
Whereas both the first and the third part can be linked with the Chronicler’s Vorlage (1 Kgs 15:17–22 and 1 Kgs 15:23–24), the middle section is not. Therefore, attention will first be paid to the way the Chronicler has adopted and/or reworked his source material.

20. Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maakah and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali.
3 In the Hebrew text, Asa’s message to Ben-Hadad is unambiguous: ‘There is an alliance between me and you, and between my father and your father’. This rendering is found, e.g., in NEB (1970), ESV (2007), TOB (1975), Lutherbibel (1545). A majority of Bible translations, however, render these words be it a wish: “Let there be an alliance . . .’. See, e.g., NRSV (1989), NIV (2011), NLT (2007), NASB (1995), ISV (2012), RSV (1952), REB (1989), EÜ (1980). Since the Hebrew has no verb here, the only correct rendering would be to consider Asa’s opening words as referring to a fact.

With them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin, and also Mizpah. 7. At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: “Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand. 8. Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on the Lord, he delivered them into your hand. 9. For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war.” 10. Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people. 11. The events of Asa’s reign, 23.

12. In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the Lord, but only from the physicians.
In his old age, however, his feet became diseased.

was buried with them in the city of his father David.
• First, the context of both passages is quite different. In 1 Kgs 15:16 it is said
that ‘there was war between Asa and King Baasha of Israel all their days’. The action of Baasha against Ramah as reported in 1 Kgs 15:17 is to be observed therefore as an illustration of it. In 2 Chronicles 16, however, Baasha’s building activities in Ramah mark a completely new episode. Until that very moment, Asa had been free from war: ‘there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa’ (2 Chr 15:19). According to the Chronicler, the attack of Baasha on Ramah in fact opens the ‘negative’ period of Asa’s reign.
• A second marked feature relates to the Chronicler’s shortening of Asa’s
action towards Ben-Hadad (2 Chr 16:2) as opposed to the one in 1 Kgs 15:1819. Not only all kinds of redundant words, collocations, and phrases have been skipped,4 Ben-Hadad has also been deprived of his patronyms (‘son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion’) and the pejorative šoḥad (‘bribe’) from 1 Kgs 15:19 has been left out. And whereas 1 Kgs 15:22 has a quite rigorous message (‘King Asa issued an order to all Judah – no one was exempt – ’), the Chronicler has a more neutral version: ‘King Asa brought all the men of Judah’ (2 Chr 16:6).
• Third, there is a different approach as to geographical specifications. ‘All
Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali’ (1 Kgs 15:20) has been altered into ‘all the store cities of Naphtali’ (2 Chr 16:4). The phrase ‘Baasha withdrew to Tirzah’
4 E.g. ‘all the silver and gold that was left; He entrusted it to his officials’.



146 Beentjes
(1 Kgs 15:21) becomes a more general statement in the Chronicler’s report: ‘Baasha abandoned his work’ (2 Chr 16:4).
And from the point onwards that both passages can be read again in a synoptic view, it strikes the eye that the Hebrew of the Chronicler’s account of 2 Chr 16:11–14 has only twelve words in common with his parent text in 1 Kgs 15:23–24.5
3 Hanani’s Address (2 Chr 16:7–10)
The alliance between Asa of Judah and Ben-Hadad of Aram induced the Chronicler to put the seer Hanani on the scene. This passage is structured by a marked literary feature. Both the opening words (16:7) and the concluding collocation (16:10) create a perfect inclusion: ‘At that time’. It is a well-known fact that for the Chronicler prophetic addresses are the most suitable occasions to present his own theological message. And the words he makes Hanani say are no exception to that. In the Book of Chronicles a total of eighteen prophetic addresses is found, of which no less than fourteen have no parallel in 1–2 Samuel or 1–2 Kings and can therefore be characterized as a creation by the Chronicler himself, a phenomenon which is often referred to with the technical term Sondergut.6 At least ten times these prophetic addresses are put into the mouth of persons who nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible are known as prophet, seer, or man of God.7 In a number of instances they are expressly presented with the help of a special introductory formula of divine inspiration: ‘the spirit clothed . . .’ (1 Chr 12:19; 2 Chr 24:20); ‘the spirit of God came upon . . .’ (2 Chr 15:1; 20:14).
5 ‘the events of Asa’; ‘written in the book of the kings of Judah’; ‘feet’ ‘Asa rested with his ancestors’; ‘the city of David’. 6 Among this category are the narratives relating to the following characters: the prophet Shemaiah (2 Chr 12:5–8), the inspired messenger Azariah (2 Chr 15:1–7), the seer Hanani (2 Chr 16:7–10), the visionary Jehu (2 Chr 19:1–3), the inspired Levite Jahaziel (2 Chr 20:14–17), the prophet Eliezer (2 Chr 20:37), the inspired messenger Zechariah (2 Chr 24:20–21), a man of God (2 Chr 25:7–9), a nameless prophet (2 Chr 25:15–16), the prophet Oded (2 Chr 28:911). For details, see R.K. Duke, The Persuasive Appeal of the Chronicler: A Rhetorical Analysis (JSOTSS 88), Sheffield 1990, 175–176 (‘List 8: Prophetic Speech Material’). 7 J.

King Asa and Hanani the Seer 147
The majority of the prophets and inspired messengers we meet in the Book of Chronicles have been ‘invented’ by the Chronicler and should therefore be characterized as ‘literary characters’ rather than historical persons. Consequently, the speeches delivered by these literary personages are the most appropriate place to look for the Chronicler’s own theological convictions and emphases. One will hardly wonder that it is in precisely these prophetic addresses that fundamental theological notions of 1–2 Chronicles are to be found.8 There might have been two grounds why the Chronicler has put an unknown seer on the scene. The first one relates to the immediate context of 1 Kings 15, which was the Chronicler’s Vorlage. For in 1 Kgs 16:1 and 16:7 one comes across the phrase ‘The word of YHWH came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha’. The second one most probably is the seer’s name, a shortened form of Hananiah that serves as a kind of theological substratum: ‘YHWH has taken pity’.9 The verb šʿn (‘to rely on’) which occurs no less than three times within Hanani’s address serves as a guiding principle and obviously dominates these verse lines. The seer opens with an accusation to Asa of Judah: ‘Because you relied on the king of Aram, and did not rely on YHWH your God’, that is followed by a statement referring to the consequence of this behaviour: ‘Therefore, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand’ (16:7). A rhetorical question – ‘Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? – serves as an historical retrospective (2 Chr 14:8–12), and is explicitly followed by the central theme of Hanani’s address: ‘Yet when you relied on YHWH, he delivered them into your hand’. In the Hebrew text, parallelism and antithesis have been modeled in a magnificent way. The three statements in which the verb šʿn occurs form a tight unity. The first and third occurrence have exactly the same verbal form (
בהשענך , ‘in your relying on’); the first time it is followed by ‘the king of Aram’, the third time by ‘YHWH your God’). The first occurrence is additionally highlighted, since it is followed by an antithetical parallelism: ‘because you did not rely on YHWH your God’. It is obvious that the Chronicler with the help of the verb šʿn expresses a specific theological program, since the same verb is further used only in the

immediate context (2 Chr 13:18; 14:10), as well as in the same wording: ‘to rely on YHWH’. There also is an antithetic parallelism with the noun ידך , ‘your hand’:
– ‘The army of the king of Aram has escaped your hand’ (16:7b); – ‘YHWH has given the Cushites and the Libyans into your hand’ (16:8b).10
Subsequent to the rhetorical question (v. 8a) and the ‘conveyance formula’ (v. 8b),11 the next element of the historical review (v. 9a) is quite intriguing. For the Chronicler makes the seer Hanani utter a statement – ‘For the eyes of YHWH run to and fro throughout the whole earth’ – that is similar to Zech 4:10b – ‘the eyes of YHWH which run to and fro throughout the whole earth’.12
2 Chr 16:9
כי יהוה עיניו משטטות בכל־ארץ עיני יהוה המה משטטות בכל־ארץ Zech 4:10b
The quotation from Zechariah is followed by what can be characterized as the Chronicler’s own vocabulary.13 The phrase ‘to strengthen those whose heart is true to Him’, in the first place is clearly linked to 2 Chr 15:17b – ‘the heart of Asa was true all his days’ which belongs to the positive section of Asa’s reign.14 It is followed by an accusation and an announcement of judgment. Here a similar pattern is found as was the case in the first half of 16:9. The accusation (‘you have done foolishly in this’) immediately recalls the one by Samuel to King Saul (1 Sam 13:13), using not only the same rare verb סמל niph., but even the same conjugation. The announcement of judgment (‘for from now on you will have wars’), on the other hand, relates to a topic that is characteristic of the Book of Chronicles.15
10 As a matter of fact, ‘Cushites’ points back to 2 Chr 14:8–12, an episode at the beginning of Asa’s reign. 11 S.J. de Vries, 1 and 2 Chronicles (FOTL XI), Grand Rapids 1989, 303. 12 In the interpretation of the vision, the eyes of YHWH are identified with the seven branches of the lampstand (Zech 4:2). 13 H.G.M. Williamson, 1 and 2 Chronicles (NCBC), Grand Rapids 1982, 275 is right to state that ‘this suggests that the very early date recently advocated by several scholars [for 1–2 Chronicles] is improbable’. 14 Similar phrases also occur in 2 Chr 19:9 and 25:2. 15 See P.C. Beentjes, ‘We Have YHWH to Fight Our Battles. War Narratives in the Book of Chronicles’, in: P.C. Beentjes, Tradition and Transformation in the Book of Chronicles (SSN 52), Leiden 2008, 177–185.



King Asa and Hanani the Seer 149
However, it is not only the twofold alternation of a quotation from/reference to Scripture on the one hand and the Chronicler’s own theological idiom and framework on the other hand that mark Hanani’s speech. In addition, this twofold alternation functions as a perfect mirror image of a major topic that dominates the positive section of Asa’s reign:
2 Chr 14:5b ‘The kingdom had rest under him’ (cf. 13:23b);16 2 Chr 15:19b ‘There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’.
4 The Reaction of King Asa
King Asa’s response to Hanani’s address (16:10) is completely different from the king’s earlier positive reaction to Azariah’s prophecy (15:2–7). Whereas in the latter case ‘he took courage, and put away the abominable idols from all the land . . . and repaired the altar of YHWH . . .’ (15:8), he now orders to put Hanani into prison (literally ‘the house of the stocks’, בית מהפכת ). Elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, this rare noun (‘stocks’) only occurs relating to the prophet Jeremiah (Jer 20:2–3; 29:26). One cannot get away from the impression that the Chronicler with the help of this very rare noun wanted to bring about a subtle reference to that prophet and his fate. The phrase ‘for he was in a rage with him because of this’ at the end of the Hanani episode (16:10b) is rather tautological as compared to the opening words of this verse: ‘Then Asa was angry with the seer’. The final words of the verse are said to be even cryptic: ‘And Asa inflicted cruelties on some of the people at that time’.17 Most probably the purport of this latter phrase will be that Hanai was not the only victim of King Asa.
16 In the book of Chronicles the verb נוח , ‘to rest’, is only used in the Chronicler’s Sondergut. An extensive analysis of the ‘rest’-motif is found in R. Braun, ‘Solomon, the Chosen Temple Builder: The Significance of 1 Chronicles 22, 28, and 29 for the Theology of Chronicles’, JBL 95 (1976) 581–590, esp. 582–586. 17 The text critical note in BHS referring to this is directly taken from W. Rudolph, Chronikbücher (HAT 21), Tübingen 1955, 248: ‘und weil man deshalb im Volk über ihn ungehalten war’. However, this emendation is neither supported by any Hebrew manuscript, nor by any of the versions.

5 The Summary of the Reign
The extensive account of King Asa’s reign (2 Chr 16:11–14) holds some salient details. The opening phrase contains a formula – ‘The first and last things’, viz. from beginning to end – that has been used several times before (1 Chr 29:29; 2 Chr 9:29; 12:15). In each of these three passages a prophet or seer was mentioned being the source of the records of the preceding narrative(s).18 Though the Chronicler has introduced two divine messengers to King Asa – Azariah in 2 Chr 15:2–7; Hanani in 2 Chr 16:7–10 – neither of them is mentioned in 2 Chr 16:11 as the source. Instead, for the first time in the Book of Chronicles there is a reference to ‘the Books of the Kings of Judah and Israel’, a formula that from now on will return rather frequently (2 Chr 25:26; 27:7; 28:26; 32:32; 35:27; 36:8). Considering that the Chronicler systematically intends to omit as many facts as possible relating to the Northern Kingdom, with respect to 2 Chr 16:11a the only inference can be that the author here refers to a source he had at his disposal which he wanted to respect. For if it would concern a formula of his own, he no doubt would have omitted ‘and Israel’.19 And what’s more, on several occasions he even calls this source ‘the Book of the Kings of Israel’ (1 Chr 9:1.2; 2 Chr 20:34; 33:18). Whether this might have been a document more or less identical to 1–2 Kings is not self-evident, since the Chronicler on many occasions in his work has many more details than what we know from the canonical books of 1–2 Kings. Towards the end of his reign ‘Asa was diseased in his feet’ (2 Chr 16:12). There has been much speculation as to the nature of this disease. Was he a bad walker? Did he become gangrenous? Or does it refer to a venereal disease? In the Hebrew Bible, from time to time the noun ‘feet’ is used euphemistically for genitals (Ex 4:25; Isa 6:2; 7:20; 2 Kgs 18:27 [qere]). The Chronicler’s text has no further details other than ‘his disease became severe’. Maybe this statement is to be interpreted with a hidden meaning. For the Chronicler has used here the collocation
עד־למעלה , ‘to a considerable extent’, an expression that in the Hebrew Bible is exclusive to 2 Chronicles (2 Chr 16:12; 17:12; 26:8). The negative context in which it has been used in 2 Chr 16:12 offers at least the possibility that the Chronicler – although this is both grammatically and ety
18 Samuel, Nathan, Gad in 1 Chr 29:29; Nathan, Ahijah, Iddo in 2 Chr 9:29; Shemaiah, Iddo in 2 Chr 12:15. 19 For a detailed overview, see H.G.M. Williamson, Israel in the Book of Chronicles, Cambridge 1977, esp. 102–110.



King Asa and Hanani the Seer 151
mologically incorrect – wanted to suggest a link with the verb מעל , ‘to be sinful’, ‘to transgress’, which is such a dominant theme in his work.20 The phrase ‘yet even in his disease he did not seek YHWH, but sought help from physicians’ (2 Chr 16:12b) might give rise to severe misunderstandings. The Chronicler links the disease of Asa and the fact that the king even in that situation did not come to realize the need to seek YHWH. The collocation ‘to seek YHWH’ occurs more than thirty times in the Book of Chronicles as a way to evaluate someone’s religious behavior.21 In itself it is no negative criticism that Asa has sought help from physicians. Sir 38:1–15, for instance, is a clear statement that there is no opposition between God and a physician. The same point of view is also documented in Rabbinic literature, among others in the first tractate of the Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 60a). To the Chronicler, however, the central issue was that Asa sought only the physicians and kept himself apart from his God, who himself is characterized as a physician (Ex 15:26). Asa therefore is to blame not to have recognized the role and place of his God. The final verse (2 Chr 16:14) contains the most extensive description of a royal funeral in ancient Israel. On the basis of Jer 34:5 and 2 Chr 21:19 one can say with certainty that the report of King Asa’s funeral is a true reproduction of the usual royal funerary ritual.
6 Final Remark
Considering that in the Chronicler’s days not Hebrew, but Aramaic was everyday speech, the name of Asa gets a curious side effect. For in Aramaic the noun אסא has two different meanings: ‘physician’, and ‘myrtle’.22 We cannot exclude the possibility that the Chronicler in a subtle way has included these two echoes in his narrative.23

Haggai and Zechariah in the Stories of Ezra and 1 Esdras
Bob Becking
1 Introduction
Generally, the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah are not connected with the world of prophecy as has already been observed by Augustine, De Civitate Dei 18:36 ‘Esdras...who is historical rather than prophetical’. This longstanding tradition might be based on some sort of prejudice on two fronts: Ezra and Nehemiah are seen as expressions of a legalistic world view that is difficult to combine with the traditional view on prophecy as an individual expression of a free spirit. The last years have produced a shift in the basic view on both features. Ezra and Nehemiah are no longer seen as dull books presenting a legalistic view on reality.1 On the other hand, prophecy is more and more construed as part of the divinatory continuum.2 I therefore dare to talk about two stories and two prophets from the post-exilic era. The stories are:
(1) The report on the problematic rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem after the Babylonian Exile as narrated in the biblical book Ezra 3–6, and (2) The relatively free rendition of that same report in the Greek book 1 Esdras.
The two prophets are Haggai and Zechariah who are referred to in both texts. My focal question would be to ask after the role these two prophets play in the

Fried, Ezra and the Law in History and Tradition, Columbia 2014, 148–169. 2 There exists a wealth of literature on this topic, I confine myself here to F.H. Cryer, Divination in Ancient Israel and Its Near Eastern Environment: A Socio-historical Investigation (JSOT Sup 142), Sheffield 1994; J. Stökl, Prophecy in the Ancient Near East: A Philological and Sociological Comparsion (Culture and History of the Ancient Near East 56), Leiden 2012; S.M.

development of the plot in both stories, or phrased differently: which function did they have in the coming about of the main narrative programme?3
2 Ezra 3–6
As I have argued elsewhere, Ezra 3–6 narrate the problematic trajectory of the rebuilding of the post-exilic temple in Jerusalem.4 I will not dwell here too much on questions of composition and emergence of the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, although this is an interesting, but complex scholarly discussion.5 I just lay out my position:6 Nehemiah came first, the person as well as the book – at least its basic layer – are to be dated to the middle of the fifth century. In the Nehemiah story – memoir if you like the term – Ezra is only a minor character. Neh. 8 narrates that Ezra presents the ‘book of the law of Moses’ which is then read aloud by the Levites. Ezra explains the text and invites the people to study the book of the law. Out of this minor character, a pseudepigraphic book came into being, known to us as the Book of Ezra. The book was composed around 400. This time is relevant for several reasons.
(1) The Persians increasingly took an interest in the area of Yehud which after the regained independence of Egypt was on the border of the empire;

(2) The Persians ended the ban on the cult that was imposed on the temple of Jerusalem after the defiling murder of Joshua by his brother Johanan in 408. With ‘Ezra’ a new episode in the history of the Second Temple starts.7
The narratives on the return from exile (1–2) and the rebuilding of the temple (3–6) function as a motivating introduction to 7–10. In those final four chapters of the Book of Ezra, the profile of an orderly community is depicted. The lengthy introduction is narratively needed to present the measures as approved by King and God. I therefore do not read Ezra 3–6 as a primary historical source, but as an ideological text that ‘uses’ historical elements to convince the audience of a specific view on temple, cult, and community. For the analysis of a narrative it is necessary to define its main narrative program. This remark is based on the conviction that a narrative text is characterized by a plot or a development of the story from a situation at the beginning of the story to the situation at the end of the story. This development in the story takes place as a result of the actions of the characters/individuals/actants. Ezra 3:1–6 relates the celebration of burnt sacrifices and the feast of Booths at the altar for YHWH in Jerusalem by a group of men who had returned from the exile. In a discursive remark in verse 6 it is noted: “The foundations of the temple of YHWH had not yet been laid, though.” At the end of Ezra 6, three features are narrated. Ezra 6:16 reads: “By the third of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius, this house was completed.” Ezra 6:17–18 narrates the dedication of the temple, while Ezra 6:19–22 relates the celebration of the Passover. These observations make clear that two shifts have taken place:
(1) From feast of Booths to Passover (2) From altar to Temple
These shifts are narrated in some fifteen smaller units, all presenting a step toward the end of the plot, or its complication. At the end of chapter 4, Artaxerxes is said to have delivered a decree on the basis of which the work on the house of God in Jerusalem is halt. In the next unit it is narrated:
7 See R. Albertz, ‘The Controversy about Judean versus Israelite Identity and the Persian Government: A new Interpretation of the Bagoses Story (Jewish Antiquities XI.297–301)’, in: O. Lipschits, G.N. Knoppers, M. Oeming (eds), Judah and the Judaeans in the Achaemenid Period: Negotiating Identities in an International Context, Winona Lake 2011, 483–504; S. Ruzicka, Trouble in the West: Egypt and the Persian Empire, 525–332 BCE, Oxford 2012, 35–48.



Haggai And Zechariah In The Stories Of Ezra And 1 Esdras 155
Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Yehudites who were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel they prophesied to them. Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.8
The contents of the prophecy by Haggai and Zechariah are not revealed. Important is to note that the narrator expressis verbis mentions the source of the prophecy: ‘They prophesied bešum ʾelā yiśrāʾēl (in the name of the God of Israel)’. As a consequence, Zerubbabel takes the lead and restarts the rebuilding of the temple. It is interesting to note that in this building process they are ‘helped’ by the prophets. Two problems need to be discussed.
(1) Are the nebîʾayyāʾ, ‘the prophets’, identical with Haggai and Zechariah, or are they to be construed as a group of religious specialists? Both options can be defended. (2) What is the character of the prophetic help? The Aramaic verb seʾad here as a Participle of the Paʿel – is in Biblical Aramaic only attested at Ezra. 5:2. The verb, however, occurs in various Aramaic dialects.9 Its meaning is ‘to help; to support’. In the Aramaic version of Darius’ Bisitun inscription § 5 and parallels, the text proclaims that Darius became king while ‘Ahuramazda helped me’.10 The main Persian god has applied his heavenly powers in favour of the new king. In the same vein, the leaders in Ezra 5 were supported by the prophetic activity which in my opinion did not include the carrying of bricks, but should have been acts of seeking the divine for good omens.11
8 Ezra 5:1–2; see, e.g., J.M. Myers, Ezra, Nehemiah (AB 14), New York 1965, 43–44; F.C. Fensham, The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah (NICOT), Grand Rapids 1982, 78–79; H.G.M. Williamson, Ezra, Nehemiah (WBC 16), Waco 1985, 75–76; J. Blenkinsopp, EzraNehemiah (OTL), London 1988, 115–17. 9 See DNWSI, 795–96. 10 The phrase is repeated throughout the inscription; text: TADAE C2; see J.C. Greenfield and B. Porten, The Bisitun Inscription of Darius the Great Aramaic Version: Text, Translation and Commentary (Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum I, IV), London 1982; A. Kuhrt, The Persian Empire: A Corpus of Sources from the Achaemenid Period, London, New York 2007, 141–157; G. Granerod, ‘By the Favour of Ahuramazda I Am King: On the Promulgation of a Persian Propaganda Text among Babylonians and Judaeans’, JSJ 44 (2013), 455–480. 11 D.J.A. Clines, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther (NCBC), Basingstoke 1984, 84: “presumably by impressing on the people that neglect of the temple was a token of neglect of God”; Williamson, Ezra, Nehemiah, 70: “Moral, rather than manual support is suggested by 6:14”.



156 Becking
All these activities induced by the prophecy met resistance from the side of the powers that be, Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and some of his coworkers.12 The new king Darius, however, is presented as having a favourable stand toward the Yehudites and starts a search in the archives of Ecbatana – an action that retards the pace of the story. This element of Dehnung adds to the suspense of the story.13 All’s well that ends well: a document is found in the archives and the rebuilding of the temple is soon finished.14 Later in the story the narrator refers back to the prophetic initiative:
And the elders of the Yehudites were successful in building as a result of the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.15
The Aramaic preposition b in binbûʾat should be rendered with ‘as a result of’ and stresses the view of the narrator that the builders could not have been successful without the prophetic initiative.16 In short, the role of the prophecy in Ezra 3–6 seems to be rather clear: the prophecy functions as a cross-over point in the development of the plot.17 The resistance against the plans to rebuild the temple seemed to bring the plot of the story into a dead-end-street. As a result of the prophecy – presented as the embodiment of the divine power – the rebuilding is resumed with, as its final effect, that the festival of unleavened bread could be celebrated in the Temple. The prophetic role brought the narrative to its intended aim.

Cohn Eskenazi, In an Age of Prose: A Literary Approach to Ezra-Nehemiah (SBL MS 36), Atlanta 1988, 46–60, who seems to have overlooked this important narrative clue in her analysis of the ‘First Movement’, Ezra 5:1–6:22.



Haggai And Zechariah In The Stories Of Ezra And 1 Esdras 157
3 1 Esdras
The Greek language book 1 Esdras is a free rendition of sections from the Hebrew – and Aramaic – texts from 2 Chronicles 35–36; the Book of Ezra, and Nehemiah 7–8.18 As such the Book is a piece of Biblical historiography and can be labelled as ‘rewritten scripture’.19 It should be noted that the ‘translator’ partially rearranged the material and – most importantly – added a narrative in the middle of the story. 1 Esdras 3–5 tells the beautiful story of the three young courtiers and their quest for ‘What is the strongest?’20 The historical context for the composing of 1 Esdras is – in my opinion – the Maccabean era. Hermeneutically, the story of 1 Esdras fits the ‘lock’ of the cultic cleansing by the Maccabeans, after Antiochus IV defiled the temple.

The remark on the prophetic initiative is given at about the same stage of the narrative. At the end of 1 Esdras 5 the building of the temple has been stopped. Chapter 6 opens with:
ἐν δὲ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἔτει τῆς τοῦ Δαρείου βασιλείας ἐπροφήτευσεν Αγγαιος καὶ Ζαχαριας ὁ τοῦ Εδδι οἱ προφῆται ἐπὶ τοὺς Ιουδαίους τοὺς ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ καὶ Ιερουσαλημ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ ἐπ ̓ αὐτούς21
In the second year of the reign of Darius, Haggai and Zechariah, the son of Eddi, the prophets prophesied to all the Jews who were in Judea and Jerusalem in the name of the Lord, God of Israel, about them.
The texts of 1 Esdras 6:1 is an almost verbatim reproduction of LXX Ezra 5:1, the only difference being the spelling of the name of Zechariah’s father: Εδδι instead of Αδδω.22 The complex syntax – two adverbial adjuncts beginning with ἐπὶ, both dependant on the main verb is probably due to the contraction of the two clauses in the Aramaic text into one Greek sentence.23 In the next verse the prophetic call is answered by Zorobabel, Salathiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak. As in 1 Esdras 5:54; as well as in LXX Ezra 3:2,8 the dual leadership mentioned in MT Ezra – Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak – is rendered as a triumvirate in the Greek Esdras-traditions. As for 1 Esdras one is tempted to construe the threefold leadership as a narrative counterpart to the number of three bodyguards in the story of 1 Esdras. The leaders stand up and (re)start the building process of the house of God. As is the case in MT Ezra, in 1 Esdras 6:2 they are supported by the prophets of the Lord:
συνόντων τῶν προφητῶν τοῦ κυρίου βοηθούντων αὐτοῖς
the prophets of the LORD being with them, supporting them.
Although the wording is slightly different from LXX Ezra 5:2:
21 1 Esdras 6:1; see J.M. Myers, I & II Esdras (AB 42), New York 1974, 77; Z. Talshir, I Esdras: A Text Critical Commentary (The Story of the Three Youths [I Esdras 3–4] in Collaboration with David Talshir; SBL SCSS 50), Atlanta 2001, 324–25; Bird, 1 Esdras, 211–12. 22 On the variants of this name in various manuscripts and translations, see Bird, 1 Esdras, 212. 23 Bird, 1 Esdras, 75, adopted the view of Myers, I & II Esdras, 72, in construing ἐπ ̓ αὐτούς as an adverbial adjunct to be connected with ‘God’: ‘who is over them’.



Haggai And Zechariah In The Stories Of Ezra And 1 Esdras 159
μετ ̓ αὐτῶν οἱ προφῆται τοῦ θεοῦ βοηθοῦντες αὐτοῖς
with them were the prophets of God, who supported them,
the meaning of both versions is equivalent. Here, the same two problems as with MT Ezra 5 need to be discussed.
(1) Are the προφῆται, ‘the prophets’, identical with Haggai and Zechariah, or are they to be construed as a group of religious specialists? Both options can be defended. (2) What is the character of the prophetic help? The Greek verb βοηθέω is attested slightly over a 100 times in the Septuagint. Generally, it is the rendition of the Hebrew verb ʿzr, ‘to help’. The verb βοηθέω is widespread in classical Greek with as meaning ‘to help; to come to aid’.24 It is unclear whether the verb in 1 Esdras would refer to practical aid, or to a more specific prophetic activity supporting the building process in all its critical phases.
As a side remark, I would like to refer to the version Josephus has:
κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν ἐκεῖνον δύο προφῆται παρ ̓ αὐτοῖς Ἀγγαῖος καὶ Ζαχαρίας θαρρεῖν αὐτοὺς παρώρμων καὶ μηδὲν ἐκ τῶν Περσῶν ὑφορᾶσθαι δύσκολον ὡς τοῦ θεοῦ ταῦτα προλέγοντος πιστεύοντες δὲ τοῖς προφήταις ἐντεταμένως εἴχοντο τῆς οἰκοδομίας μηδεμίαν ἡμέραν ἀνιέμενοι
there were two prophets at that time among them, Haggai and Zechariah, who encouraged them, and bid them be of good cheer, and to suspect no discouragement from the Persians. So, God foretelling these things, in dependence on the prophets they applied themselves earnestly to building, and did not intermit one day.25
Josephus gives the impression that all Haggai and Zechariah did were acts of encouragement. They did support the builders in their activities with advice. 1 Esdras 6:1–7:15 follows the same narrative order as MT Ezra 4:24–6:22. This implies that – as in MT Ezra – the prophetic interruption is followed by a series
24 See LSJ, 320. 25 Josephus, Ant. 11.96; see C.T. Begg, “The ‘Classical Prophets’ in Josephus’ Antiquities”, Louvain Studies 13 (1988), 341–357; P. Höffken, Josephus Flavius und das prophetische Erbe Israels (Lüneberger Theologische Beiträge 4), Münster 2006, 29.

of reports concerning resistance to the building project and later on the finding of the document in Ecbatana (1 Esdras 6:22) which lead to the commission by the Persian king to finish the building of the temple. At the end of the narrative stands a note reflecting the prophetic initiative. Their conduct is summarized as follows:
καὶ εὔοδα ἐγίνετο τὰ ἱερὰ ἔργα προφητευόντων Αγγαιου καὶ Ζαχαριου τῶν προφητῶν καὶ συνετέλεσαν ταῦτα διὰ προστάγματος τοῦ κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ καὶ μετὰ τῆς γνώμης Κύρου καὶ Δαρείου καὶ Ἀρταξέρξου βασιλέως Περσῶν συνετελέσθη ὁ οἶκος ὁ ἅγιος ἕως τρίτης καὶ εἰκάδος μηνὸς Αδαρ τοῦ ἕκτου ἔτους βασιλέως Δαρείου καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας οἱ προστεθέντες ἀκολούθως τοῖς ἐν τῇ Μωυσέως βίβλῳ
And so the holy works prospered, when Aggeus and Zacharias the prophets prophesied. And they finished these things by the commandment of the Lord God of Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. The house was finished by the 23rd of the month of Adar in the sixth year of King Darius. And the sons of Israel and the priests and the Levites and the rest of those who returned from captivity were added to them, did that which was according to what was written in the books of Moses.26
The text of 1 Esdras 7:3–6 makes the impression of being an extended version of MT Ezra 6:14. Some details are added such as the remark that the building activities were according to Mosaic law, but some differences are detectable. One difference needs to be discussed. The Aramaic adverbial adjunct binbûʾat, ‘according to the prophecy’, in MT Ezra 6:14 is correctly rendered by LXX Ezra with ἐν προφητείᾳ. 1 Esdras 7 applies a participle προφητευόντων that I construe as a circumstantial clause. A circumstantial participle in Greek indicates the circumstance(s) under which the action of the main verb takes place.27 Phrased otherwise, according to 1 Esdras 7 Haggai and Zechariah were still prophesying during the whole process of the completion of the rebuilding of the temple. Here we meet a different concept.

Haggai And Zechariah In The Stories Of Ezra And 1 Esdras 161
Other than in MT Ezra, in 1 Esdras they not only initiated the escape from the cul-de-sac, but also accompanied the building process with prophetical direction whose contents are unknown to us. Would it be possible that through the Hellenistic context of 1 Esdras, a different view on prophecy was introduced? In the Hellenistic world, a person with the ability to deliver unsought for utterings of free speech is called a mantiké. A ‘prophet’ in the Hellenistic world was more of a religious specialist with an official position in the hierarchy of an oracular centre.28 Such a prophet could be consulted occasionally. The text in 1 Esdras 7 gives the impression that Haggai and Zechariah were seen as consultants during the whole of the process. In the overall plot of 1 Esdras, the interruption of Haggai and Zechariah has about the same narrative force: the prophecy functions as a cross-over point in the development of the plot. As a result of the prophecy, the rebuilding is resumed with, as its final effect, that the festival of unleavened bread could be celebrated in the Temple. The insertion of the story of the three young courtiers and their quest, however, shifts the balance a little bit. In the narrative order of 1 Esdras there is already an attempt to rebuild the temple in the earlier parts of the story.29 This attempt is situated in 1 Esdras after the declaration of the Edict of Cyrus and after the report of the return of the temple vessels but before the return of the bulk of the exiles. The narrative counterpart of this ‘pre-return’ attempt of 1 Esdras is found in Ezra after the list of the returnees and after another attempt to rebuild the temple was interrupted.30 The story of the three youths is placed between them in the 1 Esdras tradition. This story narrates that after a wisdom quest – centred on the question what is the strongest? – the Persian emperor endows the winner, Zerubbabel, on his bequest with the right to return to Jerusalem taking the temple vessels with him, and to:
ἀναβῆναι καὶ οἰκοδομῆσαι Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὸ ἱερόν οὗ ὠνομάσθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐπ ̓ αὐτῷ καὶ ἐκωθωνίζοντο μετὰ μουσικῶν καὶ χαρᾶς ἡμέρας ἑπτά31
28 See, e.g., C. Forbes, Prophecy and Inspired Speech in Early Christianity and its Hellenistic Environment (WUNT 2.75), Tübingen 1995, 189–90; M.A. Flower, The Seer in Ancient Greece, Berkeley 2008; F. Young, God’s Presence: A Contemporary Recapitulation of Early Christianity, Cambridge 2013, 260–312. 29 1 Esdras 2:15–26; see Myers, I & II Esdras, 40–43; Bird, 1 Esdras, 135–41. 30 Ezra 4:7–24. 31 1 Esdras 4:63; see Bird, 1 Esdras, 187–89.



162 Becking
. . . go up, and to build Jerusalem, and the temple which is called by his name: and they feasted with instruments of music and gladness seven days.
I see this allowance as a preparation to the prophetic initiative. This implies that in 1 Esdras the cooperatio potestatorum is even more stressed than in MT Ezra. King and God determine hand in hand the future of Israel. Finally, it should be noted that within the composition of 1 Esdras prophets are mentioned at two decisive crossroads of the story.32 1 Esdras 2:1 reads as follows:
βασιλεύοντος Κύρου Περσῶν ἔτους πρώτου εἰς συντέλειαν ῥήματος κυρίου ἐν στόματι Ιερεμιου ἤγειρεν κύριος τὸ πνεῦμα Κύρου βασιλέως Περσῶν καὶ ἐκήρυξεν ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἅμα διὰ γραπτῶν λέγων
Here too, the incentive for change is based on a divinely inspired prophetic persona. The ‘stirring up of the spirit of Cyrus’ is seen as an act of God and construed as a fulfilment of a word spoken by Jeremiah. As in MT and LXX Ezra 1:1, Jeremiah is not presented as a prophet. The collocation of words like ῥῆμα, ‘word’, στόμα, ‘mouth’, and συντέλεια, ‘fulfilment’, indicates clearly a prophetic understanding of Jeremiah. All this adds to the view of the author of 1 Esdras on history as divinely inspired and guided.
4 Ezra-Nehemiah Read as One Book
As noted above, I am of the opinion that the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah emerged as separate books.33 At a given moment in time the Nehemiah story and the Ezra report were joined and edited as one ‘book’. This joining of the stories was probably based on the mention of Ezra in the Nehemiah report. The moment at which the two were brought together is difficult to determine. The earliest pieces of evidence for the join are to be found in the manuscripts of the LXX that are to be dated after the turn of the era: Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Vaticanus. The Hebrew Codex L that treats Ezra-Nehemiah as one
32 See also S. Honigman, ‘Cyclical Time and Catalogues: The Construction of Meaning in 1 Esdras’, in: L.S. Fried (ed.), Did First Esdras Come First? (AIIL 7), Atlanta 2011, 191–208. 33 I will not summarize the existing discussion here; very instructive are the essays in M.J. Boda, P.L. Redditt (eds), Unity and Disunity in Ezra-Nehemiah: Redaction, Rhetoric, and Reader (HBM 17), Sheffield 2007.



Haggai And Zechariah In The Stories Of Ezra And 1 Esdras 163
book is even later. In Qumran, fragments of the Book of Ezra were found.34 A fragment of the Book of Nehemiah, however, has not been found or published thus far.35 It is of great importance to note that in this final composition – EzraNehemiah – a balance of mirroring prophecies can be detected. In contrast to the positive role of Haggai and Zechariah in Ezra stand the reports in Nehemiah 6. After Nehemiah had sent malʾākîm, ‘messengers’, to Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem (Neh. 6:3), Sanballat sent him a messenger with an ʾiggeret petûḥā, ‘open (= unsealed) letter’, that contains – amongst other topics – the reproach aiming at the incrimination of Nehemiah:
And you have also appointed prophets (nebîʾîm) to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you: ‘A king is in Judah!’36
Later in that same chapter other activities occur that are labelled as ‘prophetic’. A certain Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel tries to ambush Nehemiah in the enclosure of the temple. Nehemiah, however, sees through his smarty plans and stays away from the ambush:
Because I perceived that surely God had not sent him, but he had spoken this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.37
This Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel turns out not to be the only prophet in the service of Sanballat and his associates. In Neh. 6:14, Nehemiah asks God for redemption also for the ‘prophetess Noadiah’. Within

(eds), Priests, Prophets, and Scribes: Essays on the Formation and Heritage of Second Temple Judaism in Honour of Joseph Blenkinsopp (JSOT Sup 149), Sheffield 1992, 139–157. 35 Despite earlier rumours that a fragment of Nehemiah was found in Cave 4 at Qumran, the forthcoming publication by T. Elgvin, Gleanings from the Caves: Dead Sea Scrolls and Artifacts from the Schøyen Collection (LSTS 71), London, New York 2015, does not contain a fragment of Nehemiah. 36 Neh. 6:7; see, e.g., Myers, Ezra, Nehemiah, 138; Fensham, Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, 20102; Clines, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, 174; Williamson, Ezra, Nehemiah, 256–257; Blenkinsopp, Ezra-Nehemiah, 268–69.

164 Becking
the final composition Ezra & Nehemiah, this couple Shemaiah and Noadiah function as a counterpoint to Haggai and Zechariah. Instead of speaking in the name of God, they had placed themselves in the service of the inimical, or at the least unfriendly governor of Samaria. In conclusion, the combined composition – Ezra-Nehemiah – notes the importance of prophetic activity, but stresses the fact that not all prophets stand sympathetic towards the aims of YHWH. In fact the theme of true versus false prophecy is introduced in a subtle way.38 Finally, it should be noted that within the composition of Ezra-Nehemiah prophets who take a positive stand towards the aims of YHWH are mentioned at two decisive crossroads of the story. In the opening scene of MT Ezra it is stated:
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of YHWH by the mouth of Jeremiah, YHWH stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia.39
The incentive for change is based on a divinely inspired prophetic persona. The ‘stirring up of the spirit of Cyrus’ is seen as an act of God and construed as a fulfilment of a word spoken by Jeremiah. As in 1 Esdras 2:1 and LXX Ezra 1:1, Jeremiah is not presented as a prophet. The collocation of words like dābar, ‘word’, pêh, ‘mouth’, and the verb kālāh, ‘to complete’, indicates clearly a prophetic understanding of Jeremiah.40 All this adds to the view of the author of the combined composition Ezra-Nehemiah on history as divinely inspired and guided. In this historical view, the powers that be – the various Kings of Persia and the leadership of the benêy gōlāh in Yehud – play an important and cooperative role. The other decisive crossroad in the story is – as has been made clear above – the prophetic intervention in Ezra 5.

Hibbard, ‘True and False Prophecy: Jeremiah’s Revision of Deuteronomy’, JSOT 35 (2011), 339–58. 39 Ezra 1:1; see, e.g., Myers, Ezra, Nehemiah, 5–6; Fensham, Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, 42–43; Clines, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, 34–35; Williamson, Ezra, Nehemiah, 8–11; Blenkinsopp, Ezra-Nehemiah, 74–75; C.

Haggai And Zechariah In The Stories Of Ezra And 1 Esdras 165
5 Haggai and Zechariah and the Biblical Books Named after Them
A final question to be discussed is: who were Haggai and Zechariah? Traditionally, they have been identified with the ‘authors’ of the Books of Haggai and (Proto-)Zechariah living in the early post-exilic period. This identification is not without argument. The theme of Haggai is clearly temple building. Here it is reported that a drought has come over the land: “Because of My house which still lies desolate, while each of you runs to his own house” (Hag 1:9).41 At this Zerubbabel feels the impetus to rebuild the temple. In Zech. 6 it is prophesied that ‘the branch’ will rebuild the temple in full glory (Zech. 6:12–15).42 Thus far, I have treated Haggai and Zechariah as literary figures. For the authors and ancient readers of Ezra as well as 1 Esdras they were real people who had prophesied recently. The content of their oracles is neither narrated in Ezra nor in 1 Esdras. The direction of their words can only be deduced from the context. As for the relation between prophetic books and prophetic figures, I see two possibilities:
(1) The author of Ezra picked up from tradition the names of two prophets who were known for their pro-rebuilding position; (2) The books of Haggai and Zechariah were only composed after the completion of the pseudepigraphic Ezra-story.
A decisive answer to this question is not to be given. Provisionally, I would opt for the first possibility. It tallies with the way the author of Ezra uses tradition for his position and it leaves open the question of dating the two prophets as well as their compositions. The question, whether the Persian king Darius mentioned in the two prophetic books refers to Darius I or Darius II cannot be answered from my analysis of Haggai and Zechariah in the stories of Ezra as well as 1 Esdras – although I would have a preference for Darius II.43

Habakkuk in the Lions’ Den: Dan 14:33–39 (Bel 33–39)
Hannes Bezzel*
1 The Story of Daniel and Habakkuk in Context
There is only one Biblical narrative in which the prophet Habakkuk plays a part, and it is not to be found in the Book of the Twelve, but in the book of Daniel. In former days, this story influenced the Christian iconography of both Habakkuk and Daniel to a great extent,1 and above all it was taken to serve ‘as evidence for the possibility of the ascension of Christ’.2 Today, however, it can no longer be counted among the more popular prophetic narratives – at least from a Protestant point of view: Since Luther’s decision to use the Massoretic text as the basis for his translation of the Old Testament, following Karlstadt’s suggestion in his De canonicis scripturis libellus (1520),3 Dan 14 and the other ‘additions’ to the book of Daniel were demoted to the status of apocrypha. They were useful to read but not to be regarded as authoritative books of Sacred Scripture.4 In order that these beautiful “wild flowers” not be lost, however, Luther advised that they be planted in a separate “herbal garden.”5

Visual Arts’, EBR 6 (2013), 128–131, with the example in column 130. 2 So Cyril of Jerusalem, Catech. 14.25; cf. K. Bracht, Art. ‘Daniel (Book and Person): IV. Christianity. A.

It is interesting to note that the canonical status of the “additions” was questioned already by some Church fathers, such as Hippolyt (cf. K.

Some of the very special flowers in this garden are the stories of “Bel and the Dragon” which offer Habakkuk the opportunity for a short but important appearance. Daniel has been thrown into the famous lions’ den once again (in light of the wider context of the book) – this time not because of his faithful prayers, but because he violates the religious sentiments of the Babylonian citizens: his way of demonstrating the mortal character of a highly venerated dragon or serpent had been too successful. It had aroused the wrath of the crowd which forced the king to hand over the wise man to be delivered ad bestias. The dragon had burst open after devouring a ‘cake’ (μάζαν, 14:27) baked by Daniel. In revenge, the people want to see if the cook himself might be easier to digest, and they serve him to the hungry lions. This experiment fails, however, as it already had in Dan 6. The sage is neither tasted nor touched by the seven hungry beasts. He has been sitting in their uncomfortable presence for six long days, however, when Habakkuk enters the stage:
33 And it happened on the sixth day, and Habakkuk, who was carrying bread crumbled into soup in a pot and a jar of mixed wine, was on his way into the field to he harvesters. 34 And an angel of the Lord spoke to Habakkuk and said: Thus says (the Lord)6 God: Take the meal which you are carrying to Daniel (servant / son of’ Baltasar)7 to the den of lions in Babylon. 35 And Habakkuk said: Lord God, I have never seen Babylon and
6 ‘The Lord’ (κύριος) is missing in P 967 in v. 34, 37, but not in v. 35, 38 (v. 39–40 are not preserved), cf. A. Geissen, Der Septuaginta-Text des Buches Daniel: Kap. 5–12, zusammen mit Susanna, Bel et Draco sowie Esther Kap. 1,1a–2,15 nach dem Kölner Teil des Papyrus 967 (PTA 5), Bonn 1968, 276. For a comparison of Ziegler’s 1954 edition with the entire P 967, see T. McLay, ‘A Collation of Variants from 967 to Ziegler’s Critical Edition of Susanna, Daniel, Bel et Draco’, Textus 18 (1995), 121–34. 7 The strange classification τω του Βαλθασαρ is not attested by codex 88 and the Syrohexapla, but is found in P 967 (cf. A. Geissen, Der Septuaginta-Text des Buches Daniel: Kap. 5–12, 276). According to my own inspection of the fragment in question (p 34v), this reading of the genitive του for the last word in line four of 34v is indeed probable, if not necessarily cogent (cf. the presentation on the internet: http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/NRWakademie/ papyrologie/PTheol/PT34v.jpg). Commonly, in the Book of Daniel ‘Baltasar’ is Daniel’s Babylonian cognomen, not his father’s name, cf. Dan 1:7; 2:26; 10:1. Accordingly, Geissen does not want the genitive to be understood as a filiation (as, for example, the translation of the Septuaginta Deutsch, page 1465, but as indicating Daniel’s status as a ‘slave of BelshazzarBaltasar’ (Geissen, Septuaginta-Text, 277). Given this meaning, its purpose could be seen as an attempt to harmonise the chronology of Daniel and Habakkuk by taking notice of Dan 14:2, according to which Daniel was a ‘confidant of the Babylonian king’ (συμβιωτής τοῦ βασιλέως) and connecting the latter with a name from the Daniel tradition that was as close as possible to the assumed dating of Habakkuk, viz. Belshazzar / Baltasar from Dan 5.



Habakkuk in the Lions’ Den 171
I do not know where the den of lions is. 36 And the angel of the Lord lifted Habakkuk by the hair of his head and deposited him right above the den in Babylon. 37 And Habakkuk said to Daniel: Get up, eat the meal which the (Lord) God has sent you. 38 And Daniel said: So the Lord God has remembered me who does not forsake those who love him. 39 And Daniel ate. But the angel of the Lord put Habakkuk back to where he had taken him on the same day. But the Lord God remembered Daniel. 40 But after that the king came out, mourning for Daniel, and looking into the den he sees him sitting.
Delighted, the king praises the Lord as the only God and lifts his friend up from the pit. The real evildoers are thrown into the den instead, and the lions do not hesitate to demonstrate that their reticence toward Daniel had nothing to do with a sudden aversion to human flesh, since ‘they [i.e. the villains] were devoured’ (καὶ κατεβρώθησαν). This is the strange story of the short encounter between Daniel and Habakkuk according to its Septuagint (ο’) version, attested by papyrus P 967, the Codex Chisianus (88) and the Syrohexapla. As is well known, the textus receptus taken over by the Church has not been this version but the one which traditionally has been ascribed to Theodotion (θ’). How these two Greek versions of the Book of Daniel relate to each other has been a matter of debate and has been re-examined many times. I will not enter this discussion with regard to the book as a whole nor even the entire chapter of Dan 14. However, when it comes to the Habakkuk story I think that, compared with ο’, the θ’-version does not represent an independent version of the same tradition8 nor a younger (and better) translation of the same Semitic Vorlage.9 In general, it is not the
8 The most recent article of J.R. Trotter, for example, wants to deduce the differences between both versions in Dan 14:1–22 from two already different Semitic Vorlagen (cf. J.R. Trotter, ‘Another Stage in the Redactional History of the Bel Story (Dan 14:1–22): The Evidence of Polemic against Foreign Priests and the Focus on Daniel in the Old Greek’, JSJ 44 (2013), 481–496); cf. C.A. Moore, Daniel, Esther and Jeremiah: The Additions (AncB 44), New York 1977, 119. At least for the Habakkuk-story, this explanation seems rather unlikely to me: Here, Theodotion and LXX are too close to each other for being the result of two different translations of different Vorlagen. 9 Cf. O. Plöger, ‘Zusätze zu Daniel’, in: H. Bardtke/O. Plöger, Historische und legendarische Erzählungen: Zusätze zu Esther. Zusätze zu Daniel (JSHRZ I/1), Gütersloh 1973, 53–87, 65–66.

older text,10 but on the contrary shows clear signs of being a revision.11 It provides a smoother narrative continuity by a) shortening seemingly superfluous pieces of information and b) adding explanations and emphases where they seemed to be missing. Here are three examples. According to LXX, v. 33 gives a detailed description of the meal which the prophet-cook has prepared for his workers: ‘bread crumbled into soup in a pot and a jar of mixed wine’ (ἄρτους ἐντεθρυμμένους ἐν σκάφῃ ἐν ἑψήματι καὶ στάμνον οἴνου κεκερασμένου). θ’ emphasises the fact that the meal had been cooked by Habakkuk himself, but changes the details of the recipe and, what is more, omits the wine: ‘He himself had cooked a soup and crumbled bread into a pot’ (καὶ αὐτὸς ἥψησεν ἕψεμα καὶ ἐνέθρυψεν ἄρτους εἰς σκάφην).12 In so doing an intratextual connection with the parallel in v. 11 is missed. There, it is the statue of the false and dead god Bel who is served food and mixed wine (ο’: βρώματα [. . .] καί οἶνος κερασθεὶς; θ’: βρώματα καὶ τὸν οἶνον κεράσας); here, it is Daniel who is being served food and wine by the real and living God. At the same time, θ’ seems to feel the necessity to introduce Habakkuk properly. In the ο’-version he simply appears on stage in v. 33. Theodotion sets a new starting point, classifying the new character clearly as ‘the prophet’ and locating his whereabouts: ‘And there was Habakkuk, the prophet, in Judea’ (καὶ ἦν Αμβακουμ ὁ προφήτης ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ). As a second and third example I would like to put the focus both on Habakkuk’s appearance and on his exit. According to ο’, in v. 32 Daniel has been sitting in the den ‘for six days’ (ἡμέρας ἕξ), and on that very day Habakkuk is called to action (v. 33): ‘And it happened on the sixth day’ (καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ). Theodotion on the other hand provides no date at all in this instance – summing it up rather with the information in v. 40 (‘after that’, μετὰ ταῦτα) and making the king enter ‘on the seventh day’ (τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ).

With the omission of the wine she sees encratitic moral principles (‘enkratitische[. . .] Moral’) at work (ibd.). Koch, who generally regards the θ’-version to be the older one, interprets the case differently: According to him, LXX adds the wine in order to adapt the menu to Greek culinary conventions (see K. Koch, Deuterokanonische Zusätze II, 176).



Habakkuk in the Lions’ Den 173
Thus the repetition is avoided, and at the same time the final act of salvation, Daniel’s rescue from the pit, is dated and brought into the focus. This observation draws attention to the end of our short episode and our third example, which appears in v. 38–39. In the ο’-version, the central point that God remembers is given twice, first in Daniel’s thankful praise (v. 38), and then again by the narrator (v. 39). This second reference is missing in θ’ and to my mind the best explanation for this fact is that the doublet was omitted in order to produce a smoother text.13 The second edition of the relevant Göttingen Septuaginta volume (XVI / 2) by Munnich illustrates that this is a common tendency and one to which editors are still prone today. While Ziegler reproduces the “repetition” in his ο’-text,14 it is marked as a “doublet” by Munnich, without any basis in the textual tradition and clearly against P 967.15 Munnich argues that the sentence would ‘make no sense in v. 39’.16 In doing so, Munnich creates a lectio facilior just as “Theodotion” had done, and tends to eliminate a phenomenon text-critically which – along with the doubling of the ‘six days’ in v. 32–33 – should be interpreted in a redaction-critical way instead. Coming back to the story (in its ο’–version) as a whole, the first question one might ask is: Why must poor Daniel starve for six long days before God intervenes and he is supplied with food? An initial, rather simple, answer is suggested by a redaction-critical interpretation. Daniel had to wait for six days because the duration of his detention was already part of the story before Habakkuk and his role were added to it. The twofold reference to God’s remembering in v. 38 and v. 39 as well as the six days mentioned in v. 32 and v. 34, which we discussed above from a text-critical point of view, both raise the redaction-critical suspicion of indicating literary seams. In both instances these repetitions look like a kind of catchword connection. In fact, if by way of trial one takes out the entire Habakkuk-episode, one can derive a fully coherent Daniel story: ‘32And the crowd threw Daniel into the den that he should be devoured and get no grave. And Daniel was in the den for six days. [. . .] But the Lord God remembered Daniel. 40And after that the

king came out, mourning for Daniel, and when he looks into the den he sees him sitting.’ In this story, Daniel’s problem is not so much the lack of food but rather as in the Massoretic version of Dan 6 – the danger of becoming food for the lions himself. This problem is solved by the protection of God who remembers Daniel and has him brought up by the king who praises the only true God and condemns the real evildoers.17 Our episode, however, puts the focus on a different cause of distress: Daniel has been sitting in the pit for six days – he must be hungry. Therefore, the six days are highlighted, and Daniel’s praise that the Lord has finally remembered him refers now to his being fed – instead of not being food. One might also say that the date of Daniel’s deliverance is shifted from the morning of the seventh to the afternoon of the sixth day, or, expressed in terms of space rather than of time, from the brim of the den to its bottom. So the Habakkuk story takes up the two central points from its later context, the period of six days on the one hand and the fact that ultimately God remembers his friends on the other. These are transformed into a new story in which the prophet Habakkuk plays a major role. Taken together, these observations provide reason to doubt the literary unity of the entire Bel-chapter and instead regard the Habakkuk-episode as a secondary insertion into the surrounding narrative. But if one accepts this theory, then the question it raises about the literary character of this piece in relation to its context can be more closely defined and interpreted. Kottsieper, for example, argues that vv. 33–39 might represent 1) a once independent Habakkuk-Daniel tradition, a kind of novella whose 2) purpose was to demonstrate that kosher living was possible even outside Eretz Israel.18 However, I do not think that either thesis gets to the heart of the matter. Ad 1): The connection of the story to its immediate literary context is anchored much too deeply in its inmost corpus to be understood as the reworking of an independent text. This is shown best by Kottsieper’s reconstructed tradition itself. In order to derive a once-independent narrative, he has to strip it of all connections to its context and credit them to the work of a redactor. This includes themes such as the sixth day in v. 33 and every reference to the lions’ den (v. 34, 35, 36).19 The latter operation seems to be justified by the observation that the short Habakkuk-biography of the vitae prophetarum,

Habakkuk in the Lions’ Den 175
though aware of the prophet’s catering service, makes no reference to his counterpart sitting in any kind of pit. Schwemer, followed by Kottsieper, interprets this fact as an indication that both Dan 14,33–39 and Liv.Proph. 12,4–8 might independently refer to the same tradition.20 However, I think that a direct literary dependence of Liv.Proph. 12 on Dan 14 is more plausible.21 The ignoring of both lions and den by Liv.Proph. can be understood from its interpretation of Habakkuk’s travel. It is seen as a kind of symbolic action whereby the prophet envisages the imminent return of the golah (cf. Liv.Proph. 12:8). The exegetical focus is put on Babylon as the destination, and on speed. Habakkuk’s immediate return from Babylon (ταχέως, v. 6) symbolises the imminent return of the people (τάχιον, v. 8).22 Thus, ‘superfluous’ elements such as Daniel’s distress and the reasons for it are left aside. In the end, Kottsieper’s literary-critical analysis of Dan 14,33–39 results in a story in which a problem is solved that the reader had not known anything about. A certain Habakkuk delivers a certain dish of food to a certain Daniel who kindly says ‘thank you.’ But the reader or listener would not have known that the wise man was in the need of it in the first place. Ad 2) Furthermore I am not convinced that this story could have served the purpose Kottsieper ascribes to it. It does not actually offer a real solution to the problem of impure food in the diaspora – in contrast to Dan 1. This latter narrative, which Kottsieper gives as a parallel to Bel 33–39, resolves the food problem in the diaspora by recommending vegetarianism, offering an obviously healthy (cf. Dan 1:15–16) as well as practical way to deal with it. Compared to that, a heavenly prophetic airlift à la Dan 14:33–39 seems to be a rather largescale endeavour. To sum up: I cannot find a formerly independent Habakkuk-tradition in Dan 14:33–39 but instead regard the relevant piece as a Fortschreibung or narrative expansion of the Bel-story, written to address its own context.
2 Two Questions: Why Food? Why Habakkuk?
If one follows this redaction-critical interpretation and takes Dan 14:33–39 as an insertion that was written for an already existing narrative about the

activities of a Daniel who represents a kind of religious enlightenment, two questions come to the fore:
1. Apart from the matter of kosher living: why must Daniel be served food after six days while he is still sitting in the pit, when he will be rescued the next morning anyway? 2. If the fact is accepted that Daniel needs something to eat, then why must this food be delivered by Habakkuk the prophet?
I think that the answer to the first question will be revealed when we answer the second. Therefore I will deal with the second first: why Habakkuk? With regard to this question, the first suspicion might be that to the mind of the responsible redactor Habakkuk simply was the prophet of the time in question.23 Of course, the dating of the literary Daniel as well as of the literary Habakkuk is a well-known problem. The former is counted in Dan 1 among the people of the first Golah (597). The Massoretic version of the Lions’ Den story in Dan 6 is set at the time of a certain ‘Darius the Mede’ (
.cf ,דריוש מדיא
9:1, 11:1), it being a matter of debate whether he should be identified with the Persian Darius I (549–486)24 or whether he is ‘a literary fiction in the Book of Daniel’.25 To make matters more complicated, the ο’–version in this instance speaks of ‘Artaxerxes the Mede’ (Ἀρταξέρξης ὁ τῶν Μήδων), which most likely refers to Artaxerxes I (465–424, cf. Dan 9:1). In Dan 11:1 both θ’ and ο’ mention the first year of Cyrus (Κύρου). The stories in Dan 14, however, are not dated at all but speak only of ‘the king’ – at least according to ο’, while θ’ identifies him too with Cyrus. Another hint is given by the text-critically dubious classification of Daniel as ‘belonging to / son of Baltasar’ (τω του Βαλθασαρ) in v. 34,26 which probably reflects an attempt to connect our story with Dan 5 and synchronise it with a possible Habakkuk-chronography. One way or the other, Daniel is located between the early sixth and the middle of the fifth century BCE. As for the prophetic book named after Daniel’s partner in Dan 14, the Book of Habakkuk bears no explicit dating at all. Its position between Nahum and Zephaniah and the singular reference to the ‘Babylonians’ (

suggest that the book purports to be set somewhere in the late Assyrian and early Babylonian era – that’s all. After all, it is perhaps possible that a rather old prophet Habakkuk might have met the sage Daniel in the very early years of his career. Even Martin Luther realised however that the chronologies of the two prophets made such a meeting unlikely.27 If the author’s primary concern would have been contemporaneity, there surely would have been better candidates for the job. For example, one might have thought of Jeremiah28 or, even more likely, of Ezekiel,29 who in addition would have been familiar with the local conditions at the destination and would even have had some experience of travelling by means of divine translation. It is quite obvious, that Habakkuk’s flight to Mesopotamia is modelled after Ezek 8:3. Another possible reason for the choice of Habakkuk could have been his name.30 The prophet bears a ‘rather strange name’ (‘[einen] eher komischen Namen’),31 which Luther derived from the root
חבק , ‘to embrace’ (cf. Gen 33:4) and interpreted as ‘consoler’.32 Modern scholarship however derives the name from the Akkadian ḫabbaqūqu/ḫambaqūqu which is supposed to refer to a certain garden plant,33 perhaps a pumpkin or cucumber.34 If one is in search of a
27 Luther criticises the Habakkuk legend of Dan 14 in his 1532 introduction: The story ‘hat weder grund noch schein, so triffts auch nicht wol zu mit der rechnunge der zeit’ (WA.DB 11/2, 298). 28 Mittmann-Richert notes a strong intertextual connection between the Bel-narrative and the book of Jeremiah, especially Jer 50:2; 51:17, 44, 47, 52: Jeremiah prophesies the fall of Babylon and her Gods, especially Bel – and Daniel demonstrates the fulfilment of this prophecy (cf. U. Mittmann-Richert, ‘Why Has Daniel’s Prophecy Not Been Fulfilled? The Question of Political Peace and Independence in the Additions to Daniel’, in: K.

Wysny, Erzählungen, 169. 30 This suggestion was made to me by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hübner, Kiel, whom I would like to thank for this interesting idea. Similarly, Duhm assumed the origin of Habakkuk’s travel in a fairy tale about a plant (‘ein Pflanzenmärchen’, B. Duhm, Das Buch Habakuk: Text, Übersetzung und Erklärung, Tübingen 1906, 11).

Biblical prophet to act as a cook – would not the one called ‘cucumber’ seem to be the best qualified? However, I doubt whether even the author(s) of our episode, writing an addition to the already existing Dragon-story and therefore situated perhaps at some time in the second century BCE,35 knew enough Akkadian to understand this allusion, let alone their readers. Therefore, I think that neither the forced synchronisation of Habakkuk and Daniel nor the ‘strange name’ of the former provided sufficient reason to bring them both together. This was done primarily because they were understood to be kindred spirits. What then is the link between Habakkuk and Daniel? I would like to recall an observation made above: as pointed out, the little Habakkuk-episode has a different view of what constitutes Daniel’s main problem than has its context. The beginning of the Habakkuk story refers to, highlights – and I daresay is triggered by – the aforementioned six day time span. The hero’s dilemma is not that his life is in danger but that his deliverance has been delayed. It is time that has become Daniel’s problem. This problem of the delay of deliverance provides the hermeneutical key for our story. It is the tie that connects the prophet with the sage, since obviously both have to struggle with it. Of course, time is not so much a problem for the Daniel of the Massoretic version of the lion story in Dan 6. That Daniel spends one night only in the den. His danger is immediate, and from this he is saved by an angel who keeps the lions’ mouths shut (Dan 6:23). The same holds true for the other Aramaic novellas. Of course time is an explicit issue for Daniel, the seer, in the older strata of the visions in Dan 7; 8; 10–1236 – though there he is not troubled by it. On the contrary, the wise man is able to reveal to the king the mystery of time (
רז , cf. Dan 2) as it is planned and governed by God.

But time does trouble Daniel, the reader of the scriptures, in Dan 9 who meditates on the 70 year span of Jeremiah. His problem is exactly that of Daniel the starving prisoner of the Habakkuk legend: deliverance is being delayed. This too is the problem of Habakkuk whose lament in Hab 1:2 begins with the outcry ‘How long?’ ( 37.)עד־אנה Habakkuk not only shares this problem with the Daniel of Dan 9 and everybody who is able to identify her- or himself with him. For those who articulate this dilemma in the common language of lament his book also provides a way to deal with it: Habakkuk gets a divine answer to his request, in Hab 2:2–4. The prophet is told to write down what he hears on tablets like Moses,38 because ‘still the vision is for the appointed time, and it blows39 to the end and does not lie; though it tarry, wait for it. It will surely come, it will not delay’ (Hab 2:3). Whatever the difficult verse 2:4a might mean exactly,40 the general message of v. 3–4 is clear. Even if there is a delay, the vision will come true for sure; it is not a deception. What Habakkuk has to do is to wait ( חכה־לו ), for in the end (Hab 2:4b) the righteous will live by his faithfulness. The Daniel of Dan 14, who has been sitting in the lions’ den for six days and who is waiting for deliverance to come, shares his problem with the Daniel of Dan 9 who meditates on scripture, and with the prophet Habakkuk who asks desperately ‘how long?’ So too the community of Qumran, who, like Daniel in Dan 9, study the scriptures. The famous Habakkuk Pesher 1QpHab clearly shows the problem as well as its solution. In reference to Hab 2:3 the
37 Cf. M.J. Steussy, Gardens, 157. 38 The parallelisation of Habakkuk with Moses is obvious, and the prophet’s ‘watchtower’ ( משמרת ) becomes a second Mount Sinai. Habakkuk shall write down the words revealed to him on tablets ( על־לחות , Hab 2:2) and ‘make it plain’ ( ובאר ) – with the root באר referring to Moses’ interpretation of the Torah (cf. Dtn 1:5; 27:8) (cf. A.H.J. Gunneweg, ‘Habakuk und das Problem des leidenden צדיק ’, ZAW 98 (1986), 400–415, 412; M. Witte, ‘Orakel und Gebete im Buch Habakuk’, in: M. Witte, J.F. Diehl (eds), Orakel und Gebete (FAT.II 38), Tübingen 2009, 67–91, 74. 39 The meaning of ויפח in this context is highly dubious, cf. Gesenius18, 1042. 40 Perlitt consequently leaves a lacuna, cf.

commentators write that ‘the final age will be extended and go beyond all that the prophets say, because the mysteries of God ( רזי אל ) are wonderful’.41 If this is the answer to our second question, we now have to come back to the first one: Why food? As we have seen, Daniel’s problem is the delay of his deliverance. The food that Habakkuk serves him does not rescue him from the lions’ den – but obviously it enables him to endure. It serves the same purpose as the divine answer to Habakkuk the prophet in Hab 2:3–4.42 Thus the one may be identified with the other. The food Habakkuk has to offer to Daniel is the revelation written down on the tablets: wait for it, because in the end the righteous will live by his steadfastness ( באמונתו ). If the present times are hard to endure, ‘keep calm and carry on’ – for in the end, there will be deliverance for sure. Habakkuk’s food is his prophetic book (cf. Ez 3:1–3). Daniel consumes it and comes to recognise: ‘So the Lord God has remembered me who does not forsake those who love him.’ In other words, ‘the righteous will live by his steadfastness’.
3 Daniel and Habakkuk: Transformation and Interpretation
In conclusion, if this theory about the intention of the Habakkuk narrative in Bel and the Dragon 33–39 is correct, what can be said about its effect? I would like to emphasise two points.
1. Allegorisation. As for the character of Daniel, compared with its surrounding context, the Habakkuk-narrative works in an allegorising way. Without this little episode, the lions are merely lions, dangerous animals whose hunger is a mortal peril for the poor convict.43 Daniel appears to be a ‘champion de la rationalité, triomphant de l’obscurantisme supersti

Nota bene: being able to reveal and explain the ‘mystery’ ( רז ) was the key competence of Daniel in Dan 2 (cf. Dan 2:18, 19, 27, 28, 29, 30, 37). 42 Cf. Haag, ‘Bel und Drache’, 30; id., Daniel (NEB 30), Würzburg 1993, 95, speaking of a ‘midrash’ on Hab 2:4. 43 Van der Toorn nicely elucidates the background of the lions’ den motif. He finds it in Babylonian literature as a metaphor for the team spirit predominant in intellectual circles whose members always are in fear of losing the king’s favour. In Dan 6 the pit and the lions become ‘real’ ones – ‘a classical case of misrecognition of a metaphor’; K. van der Toorn, ‘In the Lions’ Den: The Babylonian Background of a Biblical Motif’, CBQ 60 (1998), 638. Bearing this in mind, Dan 14:33–39 could be understood as a kind of re-metaphorisation.

tieux des païens’,44 and the six days are little less than a week. With Habakkuk bringing food, Daniel turns into a paradigm of the righteous in general, the lions become a symbol for any kind of afflictions those righteous have to endure, and the six day time span turns into the present time during which the righteous are desperately longing for the final act of salvation to come. Finally, the food Habakkuk has to offer is more than just soup, bread and wine. It is his prophetic book with its message: ‘Keep calm and carry on’. Different acts of eating and drinking are crucial for the coherence of the entire chapter:45 the dead idol Bel is unable to eat and drink – in contrast to his priests. The venerated serpent is a living being as demonstrated by its eating. But at the same time it proves itself to be mortal, and hence not divine, by eating. The lions, on the other hand, refuse to eat Daniel, the righteous, but fast until they are fed with wicked people again. The Habakkuk narrative fits this pattern quite well, and at the same time transcends it. What Daniel, along with the reader, is being served by Habakkuk on account of God in Dan 14:37 turns out to be a kind of πνευματικὸν βρῶμα, ‘spiritual food’. Given this interpretation, the entire chapter takes a different turn. Without the Habakkuk-story, Dan 14 speaks of the triumph of the true religion over Babylon and its idols. Mittmann-Richert, following Steussy, stresses this point. She interprets the entire chapter as a narrative demonstration that after the Maccabean crisis the prophecies of Jeremiah and Daniel had been fulfilled. Daniel should be regarded as a true prophet equal to Jeremiah and Ezekiel even though the great apocalyptic end had not come.46 Thus, the ‘additions’ of the Greek versions of the Book of Daniel in general would ‘shift the total impact of the book away from

apocalyptic fervor toward exploration of the possibilities of life in “Babylon”.’47 With Habakkuk entering the story I rather doubt this optimistic twist. In the end, the righteous will be delivered. But the question of whether the reader should see him- or herself already living in the ‘afterwards’ (μετὰ ταῦτα, Dan 14:40) or still at the bottom of the den at the sixth day, is – at the very least – reopened. 2. Visualisation. As for the character of Habakkuk, the well-known message of Hab 2:4 is not only further promulgated through this story, but even more so it can now be visualised. With the image of the prophet dangling between heaven and earth on his flight to Babylon just to serve a meal to Daniel, the core point of the story, as well as of the book of Habakkuk, gets a great deal more vivid. This is demonstrated not least by its widespread reception in art history. ‘Keep calm and carry on’ for ‘the righteous shall live by his steadfastness’ and ‘God does not forsake those who love him’.

More than just a Pretty Coat: The Story of Joseph the Dreamer from Jewish, Christian and Islamic Perspectives
Elizabeth Hayes
1 Introduction
The interpretive history of Joseph the dreamer in Judaism, Christianity and Islam is both rich and complex. The aim of this study is to present an overview of trends in interpretation of the Joseph story in these three traditions. Although the boyhood garment given him by his father Jacob is often a focus of attention in Biblical interpretation, this paper will argue that the Joseph story is about far more than just a pretty coat. From the Biblical emphasis upon the politics of power and Joseph’s unique role in rescuing his family from famine to the Qur’an’s claim that Surah 12 is ‘the most beautiful tale’, the history of interpretation of the Joseph story is fascinating indeed.1
1.1 Two Primary Sources and a Multitude of Modifications
The contours of the Joseph story are similar in the Biblical account and the version found in the Qur’an, although there are some key differences in detail.2 While the version in the Qur’an exhibits connections to the Joseph story in Genesis 37–46 and to midrashic sources as well, it is by no means clear that it is solely a derivative work. For this reason, both the Biblical text and the text of the Qur’an are viewed as primary sources for this study.
1.2 Trajectories of Interpretation: Sources and Communities
Until recently, Western scholarship has tended to view the version of the Joseph story found in the Qur’an as derivative of the Biblical text. However, in some ways this perspective is insufficient to account for major differences and recent scholarship has moved towards viewing the version in the Qur’an and

Wheeler, Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Lanham, MD, London 2002, 175.

subsequent Islamic accounts as a second independent tradition.3 Regarding Joseph in the Qur’an, John Renard notes:
Non-Muslim readers may be tempted to interpret the story primarily as a retelling of the biblical account in Genesis 37–46. Comparative study can indeed shed important light on both traditions, but ceding authority or definitive form to earlier tradition may diminish the value of the latter. The two accounts arise out of very different circumstances and communicate different messages: each must be read on its own terms.4
While interpreters reading the Joseph account from within a faith tradition may be slow to acknowledge two more or less independent Joseph traditions and struggle with the idea of ‘ceding authority’, such decoupling of the Biblical and Islamic accounts of the Joseph story might represent an important step forward for constructive dialogue. The move opens the door for Jewish, Christian and Islamic faith communities each to read and reflect upon its own canonical scriptural text without demanding consensus regarding either the literary shape of the story or the theological construction resulting from interpretation within a given context. Additionally, understanding the development of the two versions as separate traditions allows academic freedom to explore the ramifications of separate literary texts without demanding priority for either.5
1.3 Joseph is a Dreamer (But is he a Prophet?)
While both the Biblical and Qur’an accounts agree that Joseph is a dreamer, the question of prophet-hood still remains. What do the dual traditions have to say about Joseph as prophet? In the Qur’an, events within the narrative have been seen as a series of tests of Joseph’s fitness for prophet-hood while the biblical account of Joseph is set in a time frame prior to that of the writing prophets. Because of this, there is no explicit reference to Joseph as a prophet in the biblical account. However, the biblical account presents the role of Joseph as a dreamer and as an interpreter of dreams, thus as one who heard directly from God. In neither the Qur’an nor the biblical text does Joseph receive a particular message with instructions for a given population; rather he receives knowledge

and authority that allow him to advance in his situation.6 Within the Qur’an this knowledge and authority are marks of prophet-hood, while in the Biblical text they serve to elevate Joseph’s status in service of preserving his family and thus, the family line of the covenant people of YHWH.7
2 Primarily Speaking
As previously mentioned the Joseph Story in the MT and in the Qur’an follow similar but not identical narrative lines and this creates different emphases within the two traditions. A brief overview of the two accounts and an analysis of the key differences follow.
2.1 A Pretty Coat and More: The Joseph Narrative in the Masoretic Text More than just a pretty coat: this describes the Joseph narrative in the MT, where Joseph’s sartorial splendor (and deprivation thereof) serves as a narrative marker for the ups and downs in his personal and family life. Gordon Wenham provides the following short outline of the Genesis version, demonstrating that it is chiastic in form:8
1. Gen. 37:2–36: Joseph sold into slavery (A) 2. Gen. 38:1–30: Tamar and Judah (B) 3. Gen. 39:1–20: In Potiphar’s house (C) a. Gen. 39:1–11: Joseph and Potiphar b. Gen. 39:12–18: Joseph and Mrs. Potiphar 4. Gen. 39:21–40:23: Joseph in prison (D) 5. Gen. 41:1–57: Joseph in the palace (D1) 6. Gen. 42:1–38: First family visit to Egypt (C1) 7. Gen. 43:1–45:28: Second family visit to Egypt (B1)
6 The Biblical Joseph is not portrayed with any of Petersen’s six characteristics of ANE prophets: Joseph does not have an intense experience of the deity; he does not speak or write in a distinctive way; he does not act in a particular social setting; his distinctive personal qualities are limited to being exceptionally handsome along with the ability to interpret dreams; he does not act as an intermediary between the people and the deity; and finally, he does not have a distinctive message.

8. Gen. 46.1–47.31: Third family visit to Egypt (A1) 9. Gen. 48:1–50:26: The last days of Jacob and Joseph
Section 1, Gen. 37:2–36, describes Jacob/Israel’s gift of a cloak to Joseph and the consequences of the gift. Genesis 37:3 states, ‘Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he had made him a long robe with sleeves.’ The unusual Hebrew term used here, כתנת פסים – ketonet passîm, indicates that this is not a typical garment.9 Here Jacob’s favoritism is stated outright and it is not surprising that his other 11 sons would become yet more jealous upon Joseph’s receipt of the pretty coat – the outward sign of this favoritism. Consequently, the brothers plot to get rid of Joseph. Only Reuben’s intervention prevents a case of fratricide, with Joseph cast into a pit instead. But how will they explain the missing brother to their father? Within Section 1, Genesis 37:18–33 describes the brothers’ plot. Genesis 37:23 states: ‘So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore.’10 Joseph is summarily cast into the pit and subsequently sold to a passing caravan of Ishmaelites. But how do they explain the missing brother to their father? In a ruse that is reminiscent of Jacob’s clever manipulation of Isaac’s blessing, his own children fool Jacob with a slaughtered goat and a garment. Genesis 37.31–33 reads:
Then they took Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood. They had the long robe with sleeves taken to their father, and they said, “This we have found; see now whether it is your son’s robe or not.” He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s robe! A wild animal has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.”
At this point, Section 2, Genesis 38 (the tale of Tamar and Judah) interrupts the Joseph story. In this part of the narrative, it is Judah who is tricked with clothing as Tamar exchanges her regular garments for a prostitute’s veil and back again. The narrative returns to Joseph in Potiphar’s house in Section 3, Gen. 39:1–18. When Potiphar’s wife says ‘lay with me’ she ends up with only Joseph’s garment in her hand. And Joseph ends up in prison with the Baker and the Cupbearer. There is good to come from this. Within Section 4, Genesis 39:21–40:23, Joseph proves as adept at interpreting dreams as he is at having them. In Section 5,
9 The collocation is further only attested in the description of Tamar (2 Sam. 13:18). 10 All biblical text is taken from the NRSV version.



More than just a Pretty Coat 187
Genesis 41:1–57 Pharaoh has a disturbing dream. He sends for Joseph, who true to form, changes his clothes again. Verse 41:14 states: then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was hurriedly brought out of the dungeon. When he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. After a discussion regarding seven fat cows and seven skinny ones, Pharaoh gives Joseph a promotion and a raise. Within Section 5, Genesis 41:41–43 states:
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” Removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph’s hand; he arrayed him in garments (begadîm) of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck. He had him ride in the chariot of his second-incommand; and they cried out in front of him, “Bow the knee!” Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.
Joseph is now in a position that allows him to aid his family, preserving the line of the Abrahamic covenant. Thus, clothing serves as a narrative marker in the MT. From Jacob’s childhood gift of the ketonet passîm, to a garment left in the hands of Mrs. Potiphar, to the fine linens of Egypt, Joseph’s garments (or lack thereof) raise doubts about the phrase ‘clothes make the man’. As a matter of fact, it appears that the loss of clothing to Mrs. Potiphar is what actually makes the man for Joseph. His unwillingness to compromise results in some quiet time in prison: time to think, time to interpret dreams, and time to emerge as a man of influence. Yet this is only half of the story. The remainder of the narrative is taken up with episodes in which Joseph’s family journey to Egypt, were they find sustenance at the hand of Joseph, whose dream is thereby fulfilled.
2.2 The Joseph Narrative in Sura 12 of the Qur’an
As Bernstein’s summary outline of Joseph in the Qur’an demonstrates, Surah 12, like the biblical text, also exhibits a chiastic structure.11
Joseph in the Qur’an: Surah 12 (a) Joseph’s dream (vv. 4–6); (b) The brother’s plot against Joseph (8–18); (c) The attempt by the wife of al-ʿAziz to seduce Joseph (23–29); (d) A similar attempt by Egyptian ladies (30–31); (e) Joseph’s imprisonment (35); (f) The king’s dream (43–44). (f’) The interpretation of the kings dream (45–49);
11 Bernstein, Stories of Joseph, 35.



188 Hayes
(e’) Joseph’s release from prison (50); (d’) The confessions of the Egyptian ladies, followed by; (c’) The confession of the wife of al-ʿAziz (51); (b’) The lesson learned by the brothers (58ff.); and finally, (a’) The fulfilment of Joseph’s dream (100)
Such narrative continuity is unusual in the writings of the Qur’an and while the text does exhibit structural similarity to that of the biblical narrative, there are at least five areas where the Biblical and Qur’anic accounts diverge significantly:
(1) The Qur’an makes a claim for revelation regarding the Joseph story (Surah 12:1–3; 102).12 ‘These are the verses of the scripture that makes things clear – We have sent it down as Arabic Qur’an so that you [people] may understand. We tell you [Prophet] the best of stories in revealing this Qur’an to you. Before this, you were one of those who knew nothing about them.’ (2) The story is told with didactic intent (Surah 12:7).13 There are lessons in the story of Joseph and his brothers for all who seek them. (3) There is an account of a miracle (Surah 12:94).14 (4) God is mentioned throughout and Joseph prays openly (Surah 12:101).15 (5) The Qur’an version contains extra dramatis personae in the form of the ‘women of the city’, who have an expanded role in the narration (Surah 12:30–34).16 This section, which is not included in the Biblical account, features heavily in later Islamic interpretations of the Joseph story.
A curious feature of Surah 12 is that Joseph’s pretty coat is nowhere to be found (nor is the double dream report: only the dream regarding the stars is mentioned). Rather, there is a matter of fact report of the brothers presenting Joseph’s shirt, ‘deceptively stained with blood’ to their father.17 Other mentions of clothing include the narration of Potiphar’s wife tearing Joseph’s shirt from behind. This provokes the astute observation of a household member,

More than just a Pretty Coat 189
who claims that the location of the tear is indicative of the guilty party in the seduction scene: if torn in the front, it would be Joseph’s doing; if torn in the back, Joseph was running away, hence the wife’s doing.18 The final mention of clothing is found in another episode not present in the biblical text: while caravanning to Egypt, Joseph’s father, though blind, claims to smell Joseph. Then a ‘bearer of good news’ places ‘the’ shirt over the father’s eyes and he is healed from his blindness.19
3 History of Interpretation/Reception History
The earliest interpretation of the Joseph story is, of course, found within the Jewish community. Since the early Christians shared the same text, they also share some of these perspectives, while simultaneously expanding on many of them by incorporating a uniquely Christian viewpoint. In later interpretation, the Joseph Story becomes a cultural icon, as explained by Bernard Lang in his volume ‘Joseph in Egypt: A Cultural Icon from Grotius to Goethe’.20 Lang organizes his analysis around the topics of piety, Joseph’s handsome appearance and his emergence as a statesman, all of which were part of general cultural knowledge in the 18th century. Joseph’s faithfulness to his Lord and his handsome appearance are two aspects of the story that are discussed across traditions. These topics are especially prevalent in interpretation of the Qur’anic version. However, the Qur’an itself downplays Joseph’s role as statesman while later Jewish and Christian interpretations give this topic a good deal of attention. Because there is no dearth of interpretive material, this paper will concentrate upon a few examples from each tradition with comments upon the emergence of trends within and across traditions.
3.1 Jewish Tradition
Ancient Jewish interpreters have much to say about the Joseph story. However, according to Kugel, the Joseph story is more straightforward than some other biblical material; thus ancient Jewish interpreters tended to retell the Joseph story with an emphasis upon Joseph’s virtues and to look closely at small
18 Haleem, The Qur’an, 146. 19 Haleem, The Qur’an, 151. 20 Lang’s categories include ‘Icon of Piety: Joseph for Children’; ‘Icon of Chastity: the Handsome Hebrew’ and ‘Icon of Leadership: Joseph the Statesman’; see B. Lang, Joseph in Egypt: A Cultural Icon from Grotius to Goethe, New Haven 2009.



190 Hayes
details.21 One such example is taken from Midrash Abkir in Yalqut Shimoni Gen. 39:14, written in response to the sudden switch from singular forms to plural in Genesis 39:14.22 In this passage, Potiphar’s wife attempts to engage those around her in making the accusation that Joseph had tried to rape them as well. Genesis 39:14 reads ‘. . . she called out to her servants and said to them, “Look, he had to bring us a Hebrew to dally with us!”. Midrash Abkir explains that:
On that particular day, they all went to their idolatrous rites, but she made herself out to be sick. When her [female] friends came back, they went to visit her. They said to her: what is wrong that your face is thus? She told them the entire episode. They said to her: you have no remedy but to tell your husband thus and so, so that he will shut him [Joseph] up in prison. She said to them: I beg of you – each of you say that he also sought the same from you. And so they did.23
Suddenly, not only Potiphar’s wife, but a cadre of friends as well, is included in making the false accusation. This elevation of minor characters to major dramatis personae is also evident in the Qur’an. There, the Egyptian ladies both accuse Joseph (Surah 12, 30–31) and confess their falsehood (Surah 12.51). As Maren Niehoff observes, various early Jewish interpreters such as Philo, Josephus and Genesis Rabbah each view the character of Joseph in slightly different ways.24 In her volume, The Figure of Joseph in Post-biblical Jewish Literature, Niehoff notes that Philo approaches Joseph from the perspective of his own Greek background and is influenced by two types of biography: allegorical and political. Thus, his paraphrase of the Joseph story both allegorizes certain aspects of Joseph’s life and places an emphasis upon the political aspects of Joseph’s career.25 Josephus views Joseph through the lens of his own experiences particularly that of his relationship with other key figures who participated in the Jewish revolt. Josephus emphasizes Joseph’s innocence with regard to his behavior with his brothers.26 Finally, Niehoff notes that in Genesis
21 J.L. Kugel, Traditions of the Bible: A Guide to the Bible as It Was at the Start of the Common Era, Cambridge MA, London 1998, 438. 22 Kugel, Traditions of the Bible, 449. 23 Kugel, Traditions of the Bible, 449. 24 M. Niehoff, The Figure of Joseph in Post-Biblical Jewish Literature (Arbeiten zur Geschichte des Antiken Judentums und des Urchristentums 16), Leiden, 1992. 25 Niehoff, The Figure of Joseph, 143. 26 Niehoff, The Figure of Joseph, 144.



More than just a Pretty Coat 191
Rabbah, Joseph is subject to Divine retribution. She claims that his early misdeeds, including his behavior with his brothers, provide the reasons for his later punishment. Of these three approaches, Philo’s political take on Joseph contains important but often overlooked observations: Philo places emphasis upon his rise to power: the rise to power that not only fulfills the early dreams, but in turn makes a way for the survival of the people of the covenant, albeit in servitude. In this, the Joseph narrative serves as a link between the previous Abrahamic narrative and the Exodus narrative to follow.
3.2 Christian Tradition
As previously mentioned, early Christian interpreters shared some early Jewish interpretations while adding a uniquely Christian twist to others. Interpreters such as Ambrose and Chrysostom used the Joseph story as a preaching text. Chrysostom, in his ‘Homilies on Genesis 61.10’ declares that the events surrounding Joseph and his brothers were a ‘type of things to come, the outlines of truth being sketched out ahead of time in shadow.’ He states:
As Joseph went off to his brothers to visit them, to those who had no respect for brotherhood or for the reason of his coming and who first intended to do away with him and then sold him to foreigners, so too our Lord in fidelity to his characteristic love came to visit the human race. Taking flesh of the same source as ours and deigning to become our brother, he thus arrived among us.27
Chrysostom’s typological approach served to knit the Old Testament with the New, creating Christian theological constructions that included information from both Old and New Testament texts. Later Christian interpreters such as the eighteenth century Swiss reformed pastor Johann Caspar Lavater looked upon the Joseph story as a source of moral teaching. Lavater himself spent much time with this story, preaching and teaching adults and children alike. Lavater’s retelling of ‘Joseph’ for children follows the biblical text, while also being interwoven with numerous short commentaries on obedience, faithfulness and other virtues. Regarding the incident with Potiphar’s wife, he teaches:
Falsely accused by his master’s wife, the innocent boy was thrown into prison. Yet even there he did not despair – No, dear child, God never forgets
27 M. Sheridan and Th.C. Oden, Genesis 12–50 (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture Old Testament), Downers Grove 2002, 236.



192 Hayes
and forsakes anyone, least of all, those who put their trust in him. Whoever suffers for the sake of virtue cannot be unhappy at the bottom of his heart. Contrary to what we may think. – Joseph said to himself, “It is because I wanted to obey God that I am in fetters, God Knows that I am in prison and why I am here.”28
Lavater’s emphasis upon Joseph as a moral character provided life lessons for his hearers, adult and child alike. The tendencies to reinterpret Joseph in light of Jesus and to view the story as a moral tale are two consistent trends in Christian interpretation, while somewhat less is made of Joseph’s political rise to power.
3.3 Islamic Tradition
The telling and retelling of the Joseph story in the Qur’an and in Islamic tradition is intriguing, indeed, for it is here that the story is presented as scripture and enjoyed as ‘the best of stories’ as well. My own first encounter with Joseph from an Islamic perspective was through conversations with Maryam, my flat mate in Oxford one summer. She was writing her master’s thesis on a group of 16th century Persian miniatures from Iran. Maryam’s retelling of the Joseph story echoed Zulaykah and Yusuf, a poem by the 15th century Persian poet, Jami. Jami recast the Joseph story as a love poem with two strong characters, Yusuf and Zulaykah (Potiphar’s now-named wife). Maryam’s story followed Jami’s ordering of events: after making the false accusation, Zulaykah’s friends confront her, saying: ‘What do you want with him? He’s a foreigner?’ She replies, ‘Well, I’ll show you!’ She calls her female friends in for a meal, providing them with oranges and knives . . . and stunned by his beauty, they swoon and cut themselves. After Zulaykah is punished, she ends up married to Yusuf and they live happily ever after. This correlates to the findings of Merguerian and Najmabadi, who, noting the wide reuse of the Qur’anic version of the Joseph story in written works of many genres, observe that the Joseph story is attractive in part because of its ability to travel between genres. They argue skillfully that in its journey from Qur’an to commentary to history and ethics and from there to love poetry and popular tales, reuse and interpretation of the Joseph story has followed a trend. This trend began with the Qur’anic story of a prophet which, by accretion, acquired elements of ‘the guile of women’ stories, moved on to become a love story and finally became a moral tale.29 For the

29 Goldman notes that women (and men) in the ancient Near East used their wiles to further their cause, both in the Bible and the Qur’an; see Sh. Goldman, The Wiles of Women/



More than just a Pretty Coat 193
Islamic communities, this moral tale has become a cultural icon that affects ‘the cultural construction of gender in Islamic societies.’30
4 Joseph as Cultural Icon
Around the same time Maryam and I were flat mates for the summer, British TV was broadcasting a talent show called ‘Any Dream will Do’, which was essentially a ‘Joseph-off’ to determine which of 12 potential Josephs would make the final cut for a re-mounting of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat’. The popularity of this musical, which remains quite close to the biblical account, demonstrates that the Joseph story continues to be a popular cultural icon outside of synagogue and church as well. Lloyd Webber’s musical skills and dramatic flair make it an attractive story and he keeps to the narrative line found in the biblical version. The delightfully ‘70’s lyrics in the number ‘Potiphar’ address the situation between Joseph and Potiphar’s wife. Mrs. Potiphar’s sultry ‘Come and lie with me love’ draws a response from the narrator, who sings: ‘Joseph wanted to resist her, Till one day she proved too eager, Joseph cried in vain . . .’ followed by Joseph’s response, ‘Please stop! I don’t believe in free love!’31 This comical exchange is totally befitting of the turmoil surrounding 70’s sexual revolution, yet faithfully addresses Joseph’s dilemma at the hands of Mrs. Potiphar.
5 In Conclusion
This comparison between the Biblical and Qur’anic versions of the Joseph story and their interpretation demonstrates that the two traditions both converge and diverge in interpretive stance, but that the story remained suitable for groups of people who needed to remember that they had received promises from God. Some early Christian interpreters took a typological approach, tying OT and NT together. Islamic versions move from a test of prophet-hood tale, suitable for actualization by a limited number, to the explorations of the

story such as those in Persian art and poetry that render the story in an engaging way that is attractive to broad audiences. Even modern musical theatre, using the biblical narrative structure, creates an effective retelling by clothing the story in modern guise, a story that has broad cultural appeal as well. Each of the multiple Josephs serves to illustrate ideas important in given cultural contexts. They seem to contain a common thread: that of the more universal ideals of faithfulness and obedience.

Elijah and the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a)
Eric Ottenheijm
1 Introduction
Rabbinic literature testifies to the literary phenomenon of the physical appearance of the prophet Elijah in narratives about Rabbis. What role does Elijah’s presence as a ‘narrative prophet’ perform in the Talmudic editorial strategy?1 This study focuses on a case study, the narrative describing Joshua ben Levi’s meeting with the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a). Our aim is to assess how Elijah’s presence is associated with Messianism. To accomplish our goal we will assess its form and rhetoric in relation to the Talmudic discourse in which it is embedded. Recently, scholars have underlined the role of the anonymous editors of the Talmud, the stammaim, in framing traditions within the sugya. Is our story the product of their literary activity or does it incorporate an old tradition?2 Since our story lacks any parallel in the Palestinian sources, which precludes a source-critical analysis, we will turn to early Jewish and Christian sources to assess its motifs from a tradition-critical perspective. This will enable us to assess Elijah’s role in evoking and commenting on Messianism.3 However,
1 Also Moses appears, though seldom, for example in the Academy of R. Akiva: b.Men. 29b. Note the similarity between Elijah’s and Moses’ appearance on a mountain in the Gospels: Mark. 9:2–20; Matt. 17:1–9; Lk. 9:28–36. 2 A. Schremer, ‘Stammaitic Historiography’, in: J.L. Rubenstein (ed.), Creation and Composition. The Contribution of the Bavli Redactors (Stammaim) to the Aggada, Tübingen 2005, 219–224 and literature cited there. Major work on Talmudic stories as resulting from Talmudic editing has been done in the work of Rubenstein, notably his Talmudic Stories. Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture, Baltimore/London 1999; The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud, Baltimore/London 2003; Stories of the Babylonian Talmud, Baltimore/London 2010. Rubenstein shows how Babylonian Talmudic stories do not seek to provide historical or biographical information as such but to adduce exempla and dialogues to address the concerns of the Talmudic discussion as shaped by the editors, the stammaim. D. Kraemer, Reading the Rabbis. The Talmud as Literature, New York, Oxford 1996, offers a fine example of a readerresponse approach by pointing to the Talmud’s open discursive character, its ambiguities and the evocative character of its narratives, addressed to a Jewish elite of Rabbinic students (10–12). 3 Generally on Palestinian traditions in the Babylonian Talmud, accentuating the role of language and conceptual development, R.

before engaging the text we have to address briefly the Biblical legitimation of the eschatological modality of Elijah’s career as a ‘narrative prophet’.
2 Elijah and Messianism
Elijah’s presence among the Rabbis is no continuation of prophecy as a genre nor a corollary of his popularity as a Biblical prophet. Firstly, the Babylonian Talmud has it that prophecy ceased to exist with the last Biblical prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.4 This tradition should not be read as a historical report on the end of prophecy as such. Prophetical figures and apocalyptic topoi linger in Early Judaism and even among some of the early Rabbis, but apocalyptically based claims on authority become contested and gradually disappear.5 Thus, the saying rather marks, in retrospect, the shift from canonical prophecy to a new archetype of religious authority: the Scriptural Sage.6 Secondly, Rabbinic midrash is rather restrained in its appreciation of the zealous fighter Elijah, even on his mysterious ascension to Heaven (2 Kgs. 2:11). His struggle against idolatry is criticized in Rabbinic midrash as being too harsh or excessive.7 Elijah’s presence as a ‘narrative prophet’ rather alludes to his role as the harbinger of the ‘Day of the Lord’:
165–183. On other criteria, J.L. Rubenstein, ‘Criteria of Stammaitic Intervention in Aggada’, in: Rubenstein, Creation and Composition, 419–420, 439. 4 Baraita in b.Sanh. 11a; b.Yom. 9b; b.Sot. 48b; compare t.Sot. 13:3. The Talmud notes that also in Biblical times prophecy was more widespread; b.Megilla 13a distinguishes between prophets who were needed for the requirements of the day and prophets whose prophecies extended beyond those needs; only the second category became part of Scripture. 5 R. Eliezer relies on miracles and a divine voice to prove his point against the majority of the Sages: y.M. Qat. 3:1; b.B. Mes.59a/b; compare J. Goldin, ‘On the Account of the Banning of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus. An Analysis and Proposal’, The Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society 16/17 (1984/85), 85–97. On the Bavli’s reconfiguration of the R. Eliezer traditions, D. Steinmetz, ‘Agadah Unbound. Inter-Agadic Characterization of Sages in the Bavli and Implications for Reading Aggada’, in Rubenstein, Creation and Composition, 293–337. 6 Waiting for a prophetic authority to decide on a legal issue is still attested in 1 Macc. 4:46; New Testament sources configure the expectation of an eschatological prophet as well (Lk. 7:16, 9:8 etc.). On the validation of prophecy in Rabbinic sources, E.E. Urbach, The Sages. Their Concepts and Beliefs (Translated from the Hebrew by I. Abrahams), Jerusalem 1975, 117, 301–302, 564–567. 7 The following midrash is significant: ‘Thus you find that there were three types of prophets. One insisted upon the honor due the father as well as the honor due the son. One insisted upon the honor due the father without insisting upon the honor due the son; and one insisted



Elijah and the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a) 197
Lo, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before the coming of the awesome, fearful day of the Lord. He shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons and the hearts of the sons to the fathers, so that, when I come, I do not strike the whole land with utter destruction. (Mal. 4:5–6, NRSV, adapted)8
This verse paves the way for the post-Biblical, eschatological career of Elijah in early Judaism.9 Christian interpretation of John the Baptist, who as an Elijah redivivus preaches the arrival of the Kingdom of God and announces Jesus as the Messiah, is legitimized by this verse.10 Elijah topoi are used to depict some
upon the honor due the son without insisting upon the honor due the father’ (Mek. Pisha 1, ed. Lauterbach, 8). The father being God and the son Israel, Jeremiah is presented as a prophet who honours both the Father and the Son and his reward is the doubling of his prophecy. Elijah, however, only honours the Father, on the basis of the midrashic understanding of the paronomastic use of the absolute infinitive form in 1 Kgs. 19:10: ‘And he said: I have been very zealous (
קנא קנאתי ) for the Lord, the God of Hosts’. In the following narrative (1Kgs. 19:16), Elijah is ordered to go to Damascus, anoint two kings and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat as a prophet ‘in your place’ ( תחתיך ). According to the midrash God was displeased with Elijah’s performance, in particular with his zeal ( קנא ). Jonah, who tries to flee from God’s presence, is lauded as a prophet who is keen on the honour of Israel, since he knew Nineveh would repent and thus put Israel to shame. Compare also A. Wiener, The Prophet Elijah in the Development of Judaism. A Depth-Psychological Study, London 1978, 46–50. 8 Mal. 3:23–24 in the Masoretic text. Wiener, Prophet Elijah, offers a helpful overview of Elijah in all stages of Judaism.
9 Discussion in M. Öhler, Elia im Neuen Testament: Untersuchungen zur Bedeutung des alttestamentlichen Propheten im frühen Christentum (BZNW 88), Berlin 1997, 1–27. The eschatological reappearance of Elijah is the counterpart of his miraculous departure from earthly life in the heavenly chariot (2 Kgs. 2:11); like Henoch – compare M.M. Witte, Elias und Henoch als Exempel, typologische Figuren und apokalyptischen Zeugen. Zu Verbindungen von Literatur und Theologie im Mittelalter (Beiträge zur Literaturwissenschaft und Bedeutungsforschung Band 22), Frankfurt a.M. 1987, 18–41 – Elijah becomes a divinely ordained messenger between heaven and earth in early Judaism. On the eschatological Elijah in Rabbinic sources, Urbach, Sages, 659–661; 673; 680. 10 Öhler, Elia im Neuen Testament, 289–294 concludes that Mark pictures John as a figure like Elijah and also interprets his eschatological role as the announcer of Jesus, but does not identify John as the eschatological Elijah; Matthew on the contrary does, whereas Luke casts both John and Jesus as Elijah redivivus. The Gospels value the Biblical prophet Elijah more positively than the Rabbis do and his features merge with the eschatological Elijah.

other outstanding Sages as well, for example in their performance of miracles.11 Above all, however, Rabbinic narratives feature Elijah as a physical person who meets Rabbis or who visits communities.12 Elijah helps and saves individuals or communities from harm, engages in discussion on Torah exegesis or summons teachers to behave according to the pious, strict interpretation of Jewish law.13 His presence is always introduced in a formal way as ‘Rabbi X met Elijah and talked to him’ or ‘Elijah was with Rabbi X’. Elijah comes and goes. He has a preference for specific scholars, but Elijah’s friendship with the early and middle 3. c. C.E. R. Joshua ben Levi is especially noteworthy.14 Elijah studies Torah with this Rabbi and in his company visits the deceased R. Shimon ben Jochai who dwells in paradise, to solve a Scriptural issue.15 When Joshua ben Levi dies, as the Talmud again states, Elijah fulfills his role as a harbinger in paradise: ‘make way for the son of Levi, make way for the son of Levi!’16

Mittmann-Richtert (eds), Biblical Figures in Deuterocanonical and Cognate Literature, Berlin/New York, 2009, 547–563 discusses Elijah typologies in Rabbinic accounts of Choni the Circle Maker and R. Chanina ben Dosa. 12 The Rabbis discuss Elijah’s eschatological role according to Malachi as either restoring geneaological purity or establishing peaceful conditions (m.ʾEd. 8:7); on his role and the suppressed Messianism in the Mishnah, J. Neusner, Messiah in Context. Israel’s History and Destiny in Formative Judaism, Philadelphia 1984, 29–30; see also m.Sheq. 2:5; m.B. Mes. 1:8; 2:8; 3:3–5. 13 R. Shimon ben Jochai is of the opinion that Elijah will come to solve Halakhic disputes (m.ʾEd. 8:7). The Talmud uses the verbal
תיקו , ‘let them stand’, to indicate that the issue will remain unresolved ‘until Elijah comes’. 14 Among them R. Eliezer, R. Nachum Ish Gamzo (1. c. C.E.), R. Meir, R. Akiba, R. Jose, R. Judah (all 2. c. C.E.), R. Yehuda ha-Nasi and R. Shimon ben Jochai (all 3. c. C.E.). On R. Joshua ben Levi, W.

Yehoshua ben Levi’s final Ascent as a Model Tikkun Hanephesh’, JSJ 43 (2012), 373–376 and n. 4 argues that Yoshua ben Levi’s humility in this story is a model for the Talmud’s view on how a righteous man can pass the test for eternal life. 16 See b.Ket. 77b; Bacher, Agada, 191, n. 5 qualifies this legend as a Babylonian tradition; compare Seinfeld, ‘Tikkun Hanephesh’, 376.

3 Elijah at the Cave of Shimon ben Jochai: Narratological Observations
The way and manner in which Elijah’s presence articulates Talmudic eschatological discourse is apparent in the famous story of the Messiah at the gates of Rome:
(A) R. Joshua ben Levi found Elijah (sitting) in front of the porch of the cave of R. Shimon bar Jochai. He said to him: will I come in the world to come? He said to him: if this Master wants it! Said R. Joshua ben Levi: Two I see but the voice of three I hear! He said to him: when will the Messiah come? He said to him: go and ask himself! And where does he sit? The gates of Rome. And what is his sign? He sits between the poor who endure sicknesses. And all make untie and tie in one time, he unties one and ties one, he says: perhaps I am wanted!, so he will not be restrained. (B) He went to him. He said to him: Peace be with you, my master and teacher! He said to him: peace be with you, son of Levi! He said to him: when will the master come? He said to him: today (
.)היום
(C) He came before Elijah. He said to him: what has he said to you? He said to him: peace be with you, son of Levi! He said to him: he has assured you and your father of the world to come! He said to him: he has uttered lies to me, since he said to me: today I will come. And he has not come. He said to him: thus has he said to you: ‘today, if you will listen to His voice’ (Ps. 95:7)’ (b.Sanh. 98a)17
The literary and narratological features of this tale are highly connected with its form, and we will discuss these together. The story features three scenes that
17 Variant readings in Yalqut Shimoni, Zechariah 476 and Tehillim 652 will be noted in the discussion. We follow the text of the Steinsaltz edition (431) but discuss manuscript evidence, using R.

essentially consist of dialogues, a preferred Talmudic editorial strategy.18 Other indicators, however, suggest an older provenance of some of its elements. Whereas the dialogues are phrased in Aramaic with some Hebrew, the narrative itself is in Aramaic, which shows Talmudic redaction of an Amoraic tradition. The mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic in the dialogue points to Palestinian origins.19 This observation is strengthened by assessment of the form. The narrative connectives are rudimentary: אשכח לאליהו , ‘he found Elijah’; אזל לגביה , ‘he went to him’; אתא לגביה אליהו , ‘he came before Elijah’, without mention of time lapse or additional details. It is not the course of action nor the chronology but the dialogue that is central in this story; the final reaction of the proponent Joshua ben Levi is even lacking, which shows how the narratological strategy is totally subservient to the transmission of teachings.20 These features are in contrast to the way Palestinian stories usually are supplied by the Talmudic editors with a commentary or additional linguistic features: this story, although very much like a riddle, lacks either element. The geographical setting is well defined though: a cave and the gates of Rome respectively. These settings carry meaning, however, in relation to the dialogues, as we shall discuss. The characters are not elaborated but only present in their words or actions. The only emotional feature appears when the story focalizes on Joshua’s exclamation that the Messiah had been lying since he had not come. This may express a feeling of disappointment but it also focuses attention on the connection between this story and the Talmudic theme of the advent of the Messiah.21
18 The Talmud’s editors prefer threefold structured narratives, Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, 9, 253. 19 The morphology is closer to Onkelos, see e.g. אתינא , which suggests Babylonian redaction. However, it is not a pseudepigraphical fabrication. Firstly, the hybrid language points to redaction, secondly, Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, 19 notes the reluctance of Talmudic editors in pseudepgraphically attributing stories to Amoraim and their conservatism in the amount of reworking. 20 Compare for such editorial operations Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, 256–260. Talmudic editors could be very conservative, though (260). This form facilitates memorization and makes this a typical example of oral literature, compare E. Shanks-Alexander, ‘The Orality of Rabbinic Writing’, in: C.E. Fonrobert and M.S. Jaffee (eds), The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud and Rabbinic Literature, Cambridge 2007, 48–49.
21 This is an example of internal focalization. What is focalized is defined as the question that governs the sugya. On focalization: M. Fludernik, An Introduction to Narratology, London 2009, 38, drawing on the distinction in M. Bal, Narratology, Introduction to the Theory of Narrative, Toronto 1985.



Elijah and the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a) 201
Concluding, the story’s form and features point to Talmudic editing of an older midrashic tradition on Messianism. Its present Talmudic context, however, is the discussion on redemption and human merits.
4 Literary Context
The Talmudic editors, partly reworking older traditions, compose an elaborate discussion (sugyah) on resurrection and the conditions for and the time of the advent of the Messiah. The sugyah finds its origin and its justification in a single lemma of the Mishnah: ‘All Israelites have a part in the World to Come (. . .)’ (m.Sanh 10:1). Our story concludes the part of the discussion dealing with the relation between redemption and repentance or merits, two central Rabbinic tenets.22 It follows two exegetical traditions of Joshua ben Levi on the advent of the Messiah, phrased by his pupil, the early 4. c. C.E. teacher R. Alexandrai.23 Together with the story on Elijah, this exegesis presents us with his view on Messianism and merits:
R. Alexandrai said: R. Joshua ben Levi pointed to a contradiction: It is written ‘in its time’ (
בעתה ), and it is written; ‘I will hasten it’ ( אחישינה ) (Isa. 60:22): If they have merit ( זכו ), ‘I will hasten it’. If they do not have merit ( לא זכו ), ‘in its time’.
The full verse of Isa. 60:22 hints at a future restoration of Israel as a nation: ‘The least one shall become a clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation; I am the LORD; in its time I will hasten it’ (ESRV). R. Joshua ben Levi solves the alleged contradictory statement on the time reference in the last lemma of the verse by claiming that it indicates two conditional prophecies, that of a divine acceleration of deliverance or of a set point in history. He operates with the Rabbinic hermeneutical rule that doublings in the Torah carry additional information: ‘On its time’ and ‘I will hasten it’ thus contain two messages of a meritorious or a non-meritorious redemption. This exegesis is followed by a
22 Redemption is not a uniform concept in Rabbinic Judaism. Urbach, Sages, 649: ‘The notions of ‘the world to come’ and ‘the resurrection of the dead’ are bound up with the problem of reward and punishment, and the doctrine of the soul and retribution. The portrayals of the ‘End’ and ‘the days of the Messiah’ are drawn from the vision of the ‘the end of days’ conceived by the prophets of Israel’. 23 Bacher, Agada, 195, n. 1:
אלכסנדרי , should be read as Alexandrai, following the usual rendering of the Greek ending -ος.



202
Ottenheijm
second tradition that solves the apparent contradiction between two apocalyptic verses from separate Biblical books:
R. Alexandrai said: R. Joshua ben Levi pointed to a contradiction: It is written (Dan. 7:13) ‘behold, there came with the clouds of the sky )עני ורוכב על חמור(‘: one like a son of man’ and it is written )עם ענני שמיה( humble, and riding on an ass’ (Zech. 9:9): If they have merit ( זכו , ‘with the clouds of the sky’. If they do not have merit ( לא זכו ), ‘humble, and riding on an ass’.
The midrash notices the two equivalent verbs ‘coming’ in verses that were read as prophecies of a Messianic deliverer – Hebrew יבוא in the first, not quoted, part of Zech. 9:9, Aramaic אתא in Dan. 7:13 – and this legitimizes the midrash following the Rabbinic rule of gezerah shawa – to connect the two verses.24 Yoshua reads both prophecies as containing two scenarios on the modality of the Messiah’s advent, either as a royal ‘Son of Men’ on the clouds or as a humble man riding on an ass.25 Which of the two will be fulfilled is dependent on Israel having or not having merit. As we noticed, merit is a major topic in the Talmudic discourse on redemption: will there be redemption even without repentance? Although the dominant voice of the Talmudic discussion underlines the view of R. Eliezer (1. c. C.E.) and Rav (3. c. C.E.) that repentance is a necessary prelude for the Messiah to come (b.Sanh. 97b), the Joshua ben Levi traditions defend an apocalyptic form of Messianism. This is clear from his choice of texts: Daniel’s vision of a Son of Man embodies an apocalyptic vision of justice as a man-like figure.26 Zechariah pictures an apocalyptic advent of
24 Stemberger, Einleitung, 28–29. 25 The midrash does not view the Messiah’s riding on an ass as reflective of a royal entrance, compare R. Mason, ‘Use of Earlier Biblical Material in Zechariah 9–14: A Study in InnerBiblical Exegesis’, in: M.J. Boda and M.H. Floyd (eds.), Bringing Out the Treasure. Inner Biblical Allusion in Zechariah 9–14 (JSOTSS 370), Sheffield 2003, 38–39. Note that the Talmudic editor inserts a curious dialogue here between King Shapur and Shmuel. Only a marvelous horse instead of an ass would befit a Messiah, so says the mocking Shapur, but Shmuel retorts that such a horse is not available in this world, thus the interpretation of Rashi (R. Shlomo ben Isaac, 11. c. C.E.). 26 This verse has been interpreted in both Christian and Jewish sources as referring to a Messianic redeemer; see J. Collins, The Scepter and the Star. Messianism in Light of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Grand Rapids 22010, 44–46. Collins assesses it as a ‘transformation of a royal mythology’, probably featuring Michael, the leader of the heavenly host.



Elijah and the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a) 203
a Davidic king.27 By presenting these texts, the Talmud does not straightforwardly opt for one view on redemption as correlated to repentance or merits, but oscillates between varying opinions, including apocalyptic notions. However, by inserting these views in this particular phase of the sugyah, the discussion on redemption and merits is elevated to a new level. Joshua ben Levi’s biblically informed Messianism combines the Rabbinic topic of merit, but not as a necessary prerequisite for a Messianic realization per se: Joshua ben Levi’s exegesis on merits is not on whether or not Israel will be delivered but on the mode of the Messiah’s coming: either as triumphant or in humility.28 What role does Elijah’s appearance to Joshua ben Levi play in this Talmudic discourse?
5 Opening Scene: Meeting Elijah at a Cave
(A) R. Joshua ben Levi found Elijah29 in front of the porch of the cave of R. Shimon bar Jochai. He said to him: will I30 come in the world to come? He said to him: if this Master wants it!31 Said R. Joshua ben Levi: Two I see but the voice of three I hear!
The story kicks off with a highly ambiguous spatial setting, the porch of a מערתה , ‘cave’. Shimon’s cave is the cave where R. Shimon had to hide because
27 ‘Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. (Zech. 9:9 NRSV). On its intertextuality with Ps. 72 and Gen. 49, K.J.A. Larkin, The Eschatology of Second Zechariah. A Study of the Formation of Mantological Wisdom Anthology (CEBT 6), Kampen 1994, 68–77. On ‘poor’ or ‘humble’ as identification of the Servant with the oppressed in society and the allusion to Jes. 53:4, Mason, ‘Use of Earlier Biblical Material in Zechariah 9–14’, 37–38. 28 Urbach, Sages, 683 overlooks this fact and harmonizes Joshua ben Levi with the view of Rav and especially R. Eliezer in the sugya that if Israel does not repent, redemption will not come. 29 MS Karlsruhe adds: ‘and Shimon ben Jochai’. On this manuscript see Rabinowitz in his introduction to Sanhedrin and Krupp, ‘Talmud’, 353. ‘Sitting’ is added in MS Firenze 9, one of the important Ashkenazic manuscripts, Krupp, ‘Talmud’, 348–349, 352; compare Rabbinowitz, Sanhedrin, 60. 30 Plural ‘will we come’ (
אתינא ), refers to Yoshua, thus the commentary in the edition of Steinsaltz a.l.. The rather odd use of the pluralis majestaticus by a Rabbi can, however, also be read as a diegetic element, preparing for the interpretation of the Messiah’s words by Elijah, at the end of our story. 31 MS Firenze 9:

he criticized Roman culture and power (b.Shab. 33b). This need to hide links the space with Elijah: like Elijah, Shimon ben Jochai escapes political persecution due to his uncompromising stand and is thus forced to learn the Talmud intensively.32 However, the evolving dialogue associates the spatial setting with issues of life and death as well, which suggests that the cave is a burial cave, actually the regular meaning of this word in the Babylonian Talmud.33 R. Joshua ben Levi poses two questions. One is regarding his individual fate, the other concerns Israel’s fate. Both use the verb ‘come into/come’ ( אתא ), therewith creating a double eschatological sense of the verb אתא : ‘will I come ( ,)אתינא i.e. to the world to come?)/‘When will he (i.e. the Messiah) come ( אתי )?’ This double questioning differentiates two eschatological perspectives, i.e. the individual and the collective.34 Finally, the answer, אם ירצה האדון זה , ‘if this master wants it’ presents the reader with a riddle. This riddle is reinforced by the reaction of Joshua ben Levi: ‘two I see but three I hear’. Who is the Master here and who does Joshua refer to by the third voice beside his and Elijah’s?35 From a narratological point of view, the mentioning of ‘two’ and ‘three’ is a diegetic [?] move to the next phase of the story, the physical meeting with the Messiah. This suggests that we may understand the voice and the divine appellation אדון , ‘Master’, as refer
32 W. Bacher, Die Agada der Tannaiten. Zweiter Band. Von Akiba’s Tod biss zum Abschluss der Mischna, Strassburg 1890, 73, 143–146; he is also known for his alliance with Elijah. Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, 105–138 shows how this story addresses the tension between the Talmudic ideal of unabridged dedication to Torah study and the necessity of mundane affairs like economy etc. 33 b.M. Qat. 17a; b.B. Qam. 117a (a resurrection story!); b.B. Mes. 84b, 85a, 85b (an Elijah tradition!); b.B. Bat. 42b, 58a. 34 Although the Messiah and the ‘World to come’ are both notions of redemption, the one is associated with prophetic motifs and the other notion linked with the concept of (individual) reward and punishment, see Urbach, Sages, 650. However, in our story both dimensions of redemption seem intertwined. The Yalqut versions omit this question on his personal fate and the ‘two I see but three I hear’ reply. 35 This issue is addressed differently by the commentators. Rashi answers both questions by referring to the Shekhina, the Divine presence. In his reading, Elijah is mediating between Joshua and God. However, nowhere in Talmudic literature do we find the Shekhina allowing or not allowing an individual to enter eternal life. The Maharsha (R. Shmuel Eidels, 1555–1631, Poland) mentions two possibilities: either it refers to the three Fathers of Israel, representing a typology for the merits of the Fathers, or to R. Shimon bar Jochai and his son, the latter clearly drawing on the cave tradition (b.Shabbat 33b). The Maharsha’s remarks are mentioned in his commentary on the Agadot of the Talmud (Chiddushei Agadot), printed separately in the Vilna edition.



Elijah and the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a) 205
ring to the Messiah himself, who, as the story unfolds, is simultaneously absent and present.
6 Tradition History
Two motifs require discussion: the cave and the question. The cave evokes a context of life and death, political danger, and Messianic expectations. In Biblical Hebrew מערה designates either a cave stronghold (1 Sam. 22:1), a cave to hide in (Gen. 19:30, Josh. 10:16; 1 Sam. 24:3 etc.) or a burial cave (Gen. 23:9, 59:29 etc.). The Talmudic imagery is, however, not the result of midrashic activity or a retelling of a Biblical story.36 The spatial rhetoric of the porch or gate of a burial cave ( אפיתחא דמערתא ) combined with Messianic discourse shows narratological likeness to the portrayal in the Gospels of the tomb of Jesus.37 Here, as in our story, issues of eternal life and Messianic hopes are addressed in the spatial setting of the entrance to the tomb (Mark 16:2–4; Matt. 28:2; Lk. 24:2; Jn. 20:1–2). A second analogy is the dialogue taking place: just as Joshua meets an unexpected person (Elijah), the women meet an angel (Matt. 28:2; two in Jn. 20:12) or a white-clothed man (one in Mark 16:5; two in Lk. 24:4). A final parallel is the motif of absence: in the synoptic Gospels the disciples are sent to Galilee to meet their master who is absent from this place (Mark 16:7; Matt. 28:7; Lk. 24:6), Joshua ben Levi will be sent from the burial cave to Rome to meet the Messiah.38 The second motif, Ben Levi’s question on his personal fate, appears odd from an editorial point of view, since the Mishnah that instigated the Talmudic discussion already assures every single individual of Israel a part in the world to come: ‘Every Israelite has a share in the world to come’ (m.Sanh. 10:1).39 Moreover, Joshua’s use of the verb ‘coming’ aligns his personal fate with the ‘coming’ of the Messiah. This aligning of the uncertain fate of the individual
36 1Kg. 19:13 locates Elijah at the opening of a cave, but our narrative offers no clues to this scene. 37 Matt. 28:1: τάφον, but Matt. 28:60, Mark 15:46, Lk. 23:53, and Jn. 19:41 (likewise Lazarus’ tomb in Jn. 11:17) attest μνεμεῖον, ‘tomb’. Compare J.A Fitzmyer, The Gospel According to Luke (X–XXIV). Introduction, Translation, and Notes (AB 28 A), Garden City 1985, 1544. The association with a burial cave is attested in Gen. 23:9 LXX where μνεμεῖον appears for the burial cave of Sara. 38 See discussion of Christian traditions of the empty tomb, the praeconium paschale, in Fitzmyer, Luke, 1538–1540. 39 This introductory phrase of the Mishna is lacking in ms. Kaufmann but present in the equally important ms. Parma (de Rossi 138) and in all Babylonian versions of the Mishnah.

soul in relation to the advent of the presence of Messianic reality is a theme present in the Gospels as well.40 The divine appellative ‘Master’ in the riddlelike answer ‘if this Master wants it’ reinforces the impression of the early provenance of these Messianic semantics.41 In conclusion, the opening scene sets a stage that is highly suggestive of an older type of apocalyptic Messianic expectation that pairs the individual quest for eternal life with the advent of the Messiah.
7 How Can One Recognize the Messiah?
He said to him: when will the Messiah come? He said to him: go and ask himself! And where does he sit? The gates of Rome.42 And what is his sign? He sits between the poor who endure sicknesses. And all untie and tie in one time, he unties one and ties one, he says: perhaps I am wanted!, so he will not be restrained.
Given the lengthy discussions of the Talmud on the question of the Messianic advent, the reply of Elijah is blunt: ‘go and ask himself’ (
Now .)זיל שייליה לדידיה
the narrative shifts from a temporal dimension ( אימת , ‘when?’) to a spatial dimension ( היכא , ‘where?’): Elijah’s answer presumes, without further comment, that the Messiah is alive and leading a hidden existence somewhere. Joshua has to go from the ‘gate of the burial cave’ ( דמערתא אפיתחא ) to the ‘gates of Rome’ ( 43.)אפיתחא דרומי There he will meet the Messiah sitting among
40 Whereas Josephus (Bellum Judaicum II, 162–166) discusses the fate of the individual soul as a central topic about which the three major schools, Sadducees, Pharisees, and Essenes, are divided, he does not relate it to Messianism. In the Mishnah, the issue of individual responsibility for one’s fate is underlined in a dictum of R. Akiva that ‘all is foreseen but freedom of choice is given. And all is according to the majority of one’s deeds’ (m.Ab. 3:16). However, individual fate and the coming of the Messiah is connected in the Gospel traditions about a man who, approaching Jesus, asks him: ‘Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?’; Lk. 18:18 κληρονομήσω, ‘inherit’, Matt. 19:16: σχῶ, ‘get’. 41 Fludernik, Narratology, 64, 100. In the Bavli the appellation can refer to a human ruler or owner (b.Meg. 13b; b.Ket. 42b etc.) but often refers to God: (b.Ber. 7b, 31b etc.). Jesus is referred to by the divine title κύριος (‘Lord’) and the Aramaic equivalent
מרן (Rev. 22:20, 1 Cor. 16:22 provides in Greek script Aramaic מרן אתא , ‘Master, come’. 42 For the reading קרתא , ‘city’, Rabinowitz, Sanhedrin, 60. This reading pertains in the standard Vilna edition, but mention of ‘Rome’ is made in the commentary Hagahot HaGera. Yalqut attests ‘Rome’. 43 Both Rashi and the Maharsha explain the expression ‘gates of Rome’ ( אפיתחא דרומי ) as rather meaning ‘southern gate’, with a different vocalization of the consonants, and

the people and sharing human suffering.44 The Messiah sitting among the sick poor of Rome embodies a bitter irony; the Messiah who will deliver the oppressed people of Israel from the power of Rome is residing among the most immediate victims of this power centre.45 The irony must have been clear for Christian censorship on these Talmudic texts. Since these censors took Rome as the seat of Western Christianity, they forced Jewish scribes to change it into the more neutral קרתא , ‘town’.46 His presence among the sick evokes a question of visibility. The terminology מה סימניה appears in the Talmud in Halakhic contexts (lost objects) and in questions on symptoms of medical diseases.47 This last context seems implied here, but the answer does not provide diagnostics, nor physical features but points to praxis: the Messiah is recognized by his specific manner of taking off and laying on bandages. By changing only one bandage at a time he is always
explain it as the southern gate of Paradise (Maharsha), or the southern gate of Paradise located opposite ‘the town’ (Rashi). Clearly their paradisiac imagery is secondary and draws on a tradition that the Messiah was born on the day of the destruction of the Temple and immediately carried off though to Paradise where he awaits his entry in the world, according to Rabinowitz, Sanhedrin, 60: ‘from where the Messias will come’. The story is recounted in Midrash Ekha Zuta ed. Buber, 1894, p. 133. A. Berger, ‘Captive at the Gate of Rome: The Story of a Messianic Motif’, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 44 (1977) 11 qualifies it as a ‘neutralization and spiritualization’. Bacher, Agada, 190, note 4 aptly notes the linkage of the variant reading ‘Gan Eden’ with ‘Joshua ben Levi in Paradise’ traditions in b.Ket 77b and post-Talmudic midrashim. 44 The Maharsha admits that ‘he does not know its meaning’. This remark is usually a rhetorical expression typical for Talmudic commentaries: he actually does know an explanation but does not like it (verbal information by Leo Mock, September 2013). Indeed, Rashi’s comment suggests what the Maharsha did not like: the Messiah among the poor lepers recalls the suffering Servant in Isa. 53:4: ‘Yet it was our sickness that he was bearing, our suffering that he endured; we accounted him plagued, smitten and afflicted by God’ (JPS translation). This exegesis agrees with R. Alexandrai’s proposal for the name of the Messiah: the ‘sick one’ (
חוליא ); Urbach, Sages, 685; on the versions of this text, see M. Fishbane, ‘Midrash and Messianism: Some Theologies of Suffering and Salvation’, in: P. Schaefer, M. Cohen (eds.), Toward the Millenium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco, Leiden 1998, 59. 45 Compare Urbach, Sages, 683. If we may assume that the tradition was created by R. Alexandrai, pupil of Joshua ben Levi, the reference is to end 3. c. C.E. Rome as the centre of the Roman Empire. However, by the time of the final editing of the Talmud, the middle of the 6. c. C.E., Rome had become the major centre of Western Christianity. 46 On Christian censorship of ‘Rome’ see Berger, ‘Captive at the Gates of Rome’, 11–12 and literature cited. Actually, Talmudic tradition has Joshua ben Levi visit Rome on another occasion (b.Maʾas. Sh. 53b). 47 Using the Bar Ilan CD-Rom database (version 15+), I have found three instances of

prepared to depart immediately when called, a detail underlining the imminent character of Messianic reality.
8 Tradition History, Once More
Ben Levi’s question on how to find the Messiah מה סימניה , ‘what is his sign?’, is rather unexpected in the context of the Talmudic sugyah: editors use the Biblical word אות when discussing the signs of Messianic era. As we saw before, the terminology does not evoke a diagnostic answer (what kind of sickness?) but a peculiar way of changing bandages. This visibility relates the word סימניה , a regularly used loanword from the Greek σημεῖον, to its presence in Messianic discourse in Christian traditions that discern the visible presence of the Messiah. John features the Messiah as performing ‘signs’ by healing (Jn. 4:54; 6:2), an activity lacking in the Yoshua ben Levi narrative. More approximate is Luke’s story of the shepherds in Bethlehem, when the angel announces them the birth of Jesus. The newborn Messiah will be recognizable by a specific spatial setting and by specific clothing: ‘This will be a sign (σημεῖον) for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger’ (Lk. 2:12, NRSV).48 The similarity in the use of the term is not in a physical quality but in a peculiarity of his visible presence, both mentioning the act of swathing in bands of cloth, something that differentiates this person from his environment.
9 Meeting the Messiah
(B) He went to him. He said to him: Peace be with you, my master and teacher! He said to him: peace be with you, son of Levi! He said to him: when will the master come? He said to him: today (
.)היום
Joshua goes to see the Messiah, the dialogue between them is terse and restricted to an exchange of formal greetings, followed by a direct questionanswer element. Nothing more is mentioned, either regarding the Messiah, or Joshua. This dialogue awaits a further comment. It is here that Elijah comes in again.
48 Lk. 1:12 uses a passive participle form of σπάργω, ‘to swathe in swaddling-clothes’ (Liddell-Scott).



Elijah and the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a) 209
9.1 Elijah the Scriptural Sage
(C) He came before Elijah. He said to him: what has he said to you? He said to him: peace be with you, son of Levi! He said to him: he has assured you and your father of the world to come! He said to him: he has uttered lies to me, since he said to me: today I will come. And he has not come. He said to him: thus has he said to you: היום אם בקולו תשמעו , ‘today, if you will listen to His voice’ (Ps. 95:7)
The last scene brings us back to Joshua’s encounter with Elijah. Elijah directly states what the Messiah has said. The formal greeting exchange between Joshua and the Messiah now turns out to contain a message: ‘Peace be with you, Son of Levi’ is interpreted as Joshua having a share in the world to come and the mentioning of his name ‘Son of Levi’ indicates that his father also is assured of eternity.49 The language of the Messiah is approached like a Rabbi would explain Scripture, containing hidden meanings and unusual references, and Elijah is the authority enabled to unravel it. Elijah follows the same Rabbinic hermeneutic rule operative in the Yoshua ben Levi exegesis discussed earlier that there is no superfluous expression and every detail is imbued with meaning.50 Note also that his father was not included in the question of Joshua: the speech contains even more information than Joshua was seeking to find. Elijah’s hermeneutical approach becomes apparent as well in the last dialogue. Countering the reproach of Joshua that the Messiah has lied since he said he would come ‘today’ (
היוֹם ) but did not come, Elijah turns the dialogue into an exegetical discourse. היום is a regular adverb for ‘today’ but is used in Biblical vernacular chiefly in conditional phrases, such as ‘the day of . . .’, ‘the very day that . . .’.51 The adverb is explained by Elijah as rather being an abbreviated quote: ‘For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. O that today ( היום ) you would listen to his voice! (Ps. 95:7, NRSV). Hearing one word as a reference to Biblical verses is a common topic in Talmudic narratives and the narrative echoes the Midrashic
49 Following Rashi’s comment. 50 On this aspect of Rabbinic hermeneutics, G. Stemberger, Einleitung in Talmud und Midrasch (8. Auflage), München 1992, 235–237. 51 An optative clause ‘I wish you listened’, thus P. Joüon, T. Muruoka, A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew. Part Three: Syntax. Paradgims and Indices (Subsidia Biblica 14/II), Roma 1991, 615. More emphatically,
459 (,היום הזה ). As in Biblical Hebrew (507) also the Mishnah uses היום as an adverb for ‘today’: m.Yom. 4:4; 6:1, m.Ned. 8:1; m.Shevu. 3:11 (reflecting vernacular!); m.Ker. 6:7; m.Zav. 1:3,6; m.Yad. 4:3 (narrative!).

technique of quoting only one word or part of a verse where the listener will know the full verse and its literary context. It is only curious that Joshua ben Levi would have missed the hint; the reader of course appreciates the ironical pun on the Messiah coming ‘today’.52
10 Elijah and Apocalyptic Messianism
Here our story ends and also the long discussion of the Talmud on the question of whether Israel would be redeemed or not without merit. However, the story does not just reinforce the dominant voice in the Talmudic discourse on redemption and repentance or other merits. It is elusive in its apocalyptic motifs of presence and absence, and the Messiah amidst the anonymous sick at the gates of Rome evokes a feeling of an imminent judgment on this world power.53 The narrative evokes a Messianic presence, albeit hidden to the general public, waiting for the right conditions to appear on the political stage. Moreover, Joshua ben Levi is able to meet him and communicate with him about his fate. His Messiah is present, though only accessible to outstanding individuals such as Joshua ben Levi and through the mediation of Elijah. Moreover, the message he receives is clear: redemption is sure, but we do not know the date. As suggested by the commentary of the Maharsha, our story should be read in conjunction with the exegesis of Joshua ben Levi quoted just before the meeting with Elijah. His exegesis was on the modality of his coming: speeded up or on a set moment, humble or spectacular. The exegetical teachings of Joshua ben Levi and the narrative itself recall that Joshua ben
52 On wordplay and irony, Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, 246–247. This Scriptural reply is elusive in its precise meaning, since no Midrashic comment is added as to whether repenting, having merits, keeping the Torah, or obeying is meant. A conditional reading of היום in Ps. 95:7 is attested by the 3. c. C.E. R. Levi, referring to the Sabbath: ‘If Israel would have kept the Sabbath only one time as it should be, the Messiah would have come today.’ (y.Ta’anit 1:1); Yalqut, Tehillim 946 presents this tradition together with our story, but the Talmud does not hint at this possibility. Note that the mid-first c. letter to the Hebrews quotes this verse as well and comments that only by keeping faith ‘today’, Messianic presence will be realized (Heb. 3:13–14). ‘Today’ is the timeframe the community lives in now and in which it has to endure by keeping faith. 53 During the Barcelona dispute (1260 C.E.) the convert Pablo Christiani initiated discussion of this text to prove that the Talmud knew the Messiah had come. Nahmanides had to be very cautious, not only since Christiani did have a point but, moreover, since his presence before the gates of Rome implied an apocalyptic verdict; Berger, ‘Captive Before the Gates of Rome’, 12–13.



Elijah and the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a) 211
Levi was not tricked by the Messiah in the Bible riddle. He understood him partially correctly, since the Messiah had come, and today really was that day, albeit only for him, since there were no merits of the whole people of Israel to come to them yet. The lesson Elijah teaches is that his generation is not worthy, whereas he, as an individual, was. Finally, it is striking that this exegesis is based on two texts, Dan. 7:13 and Zech. 9:9, which serve to legitimize Christian motifs in the Synoptic Gospels. While on trial, Jesus refers to Daniel’s vision of the Son of Man coming ‘with the clouds’, and the Gospel narrative of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem features a Messianic interpretation of Zechariah.54 Together with the exegetical interest in the word ‘today’ in Ps. 95:7, the Yoshua ben Levi traditions address three major topics attested in Christian Messianic discourse. Added to the similar question on one’s personal fate combined with the advent of the Messiah and our observations of the peculiar word
סמניה
(‘his sign’), this leads us to the conclusion that the Joshua ben Levi traditions represent an old, apocalyptic type of Messianism. Remarkably, no apologetic or polemic features colour our story, and there is no reason to assess it as antiChristian rhetoric.55
11 Elijah as a Narrative Prophet
Elijah’s presence among (some of) the Rabbis triggers a narrative in which Messianic reality is articulated as a hidden presence and an imminent possibility. In the narrative the presence and absence of Elijah signifies the presence and absence of the Messiah; Joshua ben Levi meets both of them and talks to them. Elijah refers to the Messiah and Yoshua ben Levi depends on Elijah to recognize his physical presence and understand his verbal utterings. Elijah evokes apocalyptic notions of physical presence of a human saviour but simultaneously comments on it citing the Rabbinic concept of meritorious obeisance to the Law and repentance. Elijah as a ‘narrative prophet’ embodies Messianic reality and refers to it. This function resembles the role of Elijah in Christian traditions. Conversely, however, and in conflict with the
54 Jesus before the High Priest: Mark. 14:62; Lk. 22:69; Matt. 26:64. Entrance into Jerusalem: Mark 11:1–10; Lk. 19:28–40; Matt. 21:1–9. 55 P. Schäfer, Jesus in the Talmud, Princeton, Oxford, 2007 argues that the Babylonian Rabbis were aware of Christian traditions, probably through Tatian’s Diatesseron and the Syriac Peshitta, and especially from the Gospel of John. Moreover, the reaction of R. Yoshua ben Levi to Christians is attested, albeit only in Palestinian sources. cf. Schäfer, Jesus in the Talmud, 60–61.



212 Ottenheijm
idea of Christian Messianism, the geographical location of Rome suggests the Messiah’s suffering to be the result of Roman Imperial culture and oppression. Moreover, unlike the Christian concept this story does not suggest that the suffering Messiah alleviates or cures diseases, nor is his suffering labelled here as atoning.56 Nonetheless, the analogical Messianic motifs probably point to Messianic motifs known in Jewish-Christian and Rabbinic circles alike: the suffering Messiah, the necessity of a sign, the quest for eternity, the hidden presence of the Messiah, the waiting for his reappearance, and the recourse to the Law as the necessary prelude to Messianic reality.57 Like John the Baptist in the New Testament, Elijah is the announcer (Mal. 4:5) of this Messianic reality.58 He is, however, also its interpreter, corrects false assumptions and embodies the value of repentance or obeisance to the Law.59 Typically Rabbinic, as well, is the manner in which Elijah knows how to decode the speech utterances of the Messiah, as either containing a hidden answer to the question of the Rabbi or as referring to the code of Scripture. He performs his role as a Rabbi would do, teaching the meaning of Biblical
56 Urbach, Sages, 685–687 notes that in Talmudic tradition the sufferings of the Messiah are a precondition for the redemption, not redemption itself, nor atonement. However, Fishbane, ‘Midrash and Messianism’, 69 discusses the suffering Messiah (Isa. 53) as an old inner-Jewish development and points to liturgical texts (R. Eleazar Kalir) and Midrashic readings preserved in Raymundus Partini’s Pugio Fidei where atoning suffering is attested as well. Apparently the idea of a suffering and atoning Messiah is less controversial in traditional circles: see apt remarks in the Schottenstein edition on the Messiah as having skin diseases (Lev. 13) and therewith fulfilling Isa. 53:4!
57 D. Boyarin, Dying for God. Martyrdom and the Making of Judaism and Christianity, Stanford 1999 suggests conceptual similarities in Christian and Rabbinic sources to be the result of the crossing over of specific ideas and semantic concepts between different forms of ‘Judaism’. In his Borderlines. The Partition of Judaeo-Christianity, Philadelphia 2004 he addresses similarities in logos-mysticism by tracing them back to tendencies operative in Second Temple Judaism. In his view Judaism and Christianity became separate religions only in the 4. c. C.E., i.e. after the historical R. Joshua ben Levi. Our case appears to be of the second category, but the possibility that certain Jewish-Christian ideas on Messianic presence infiltrated Rabbinic discourse should not be excluded. 58 The association of Elijah’s presence with a suffering Messiah is present in Matt. 17:1013. Elijah’s eschatological role is underlined in a quote from Malachi 3:23 LXX, and the impending suffering of Jesus is mentioned (Matt. 17:12) to give him a fate equal to that of John the Baptist; U. Luz, Das Evangelium nach Matthäus. Evangelisch-Katholischer Kommentar zum Neuen Testament l/2 Mt. 8–17, Neukirchen Vluyn 31999, 513.
59 Repentance is the key concept in the proclamation of John the Baptist, who is portrayed as a prophet ‘in the spirit and power of Elijah’ (Lk. 1:17; compare Lk. 9:8), the eschatological Elijah who prepares for the day of judgment; Öhler, Elia im Neuen Testament, 105–106.



Elijah and the Messiah (b.Sanh. 98a) 213
verses and guiding individual Rabbis as his pupils. In Elijah’s presence as a narrative prophet and an eschatological person, the Rabbis find the embodiment of their hermeneutics; by doing so, they claim to know about the Messianic reality, which is at the same time both hidden and accessible to some mystical teachers. Within the Talmudic discourse Elijah acts as the corrective authority of heightened apocalyptic expectations. Thus, in terms of narrative rhetoric, Elijah represents the authority for conveying eschatological reality by evoking and canalizing apocalyptic notions. Indeed, as a narrative prophet Elijah underlines Rabbinic authority and, as such, he appears very much like the Rabbinic Sage himself.60

From Noah to Nuḥ: The Making of a Prophet
Marcel Poorthuis
1 Introduction
Noah features as a prophet in Qurʾān and post-Qur’anic literature. Whereas Western Christianity is accustomed to reserve that title for prophets after the promulgation of the Mosaic law, Islam does not hesitate to reckon Nuḥ (henceforth: Noah) to the prophetic ranks. Noah is called both rasūl (messenger) and nabī, a double honor vouchsafed to Ishmael, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad only.1 In Noah’s case, some remarkable divergences from the Biblical account can be pointed out. In the Bible, there is the flood, but there is no explicit mention of warning the people of the inherent danger. On the contrary, the catastrophe of the Flood seems to unfold itself without any indication that the repentance of the people might have prevented it. God sees the evil, announces the impending disaster to Noah and Noah starts to build the ark (Gen. 6:5–22). In contrast, the Qurʾān points time and again to Noah’s plea to the people to listen to his message. Noah even accuses the people of stupidity for their refusal to realize the consequences of their disobedience. There is no doubt that Muhammad’s own bitter experience with a ‘stubborn’ audience finds its echoes in Noah’s plight. The people accuse Noah of being nothing more than a mere mortal and not an angel, as they would have expected (Q. 23:24). Noah emphasizes that he is not an angel and does not pretend to be one (Q. 6:50). Exactly the same happens with Muhammad in confrontation with his audience (Q. 6:8–9; 11:12; 25:7).2 Noah warns his people time and again, but they put their fingers in their ears (Surat Nuḥ Q. 71:1–21). The difference with the Biblical Noah is striking indeed. With the possible exception of Abraham, there is hardly a Biblical figure with whom Muhammad identified so strongly as with Noah. We might assume that Noah’s persistent plea to the people to repent has been developed out of this resemblance with Muhammad’s plea to his own ‘stubborn’ audience. This, however, is not the case, as I will demonstrate. Pre-Islamic sources are familiar as well with a warning Noah. From the point of view of method, a comparison of the Biblical account with Qur’anic and post-Qur’anic literature in order to trace influences has only limited value. In the more than thousand years between the Bible and the Qurʾān, a wealth of commentaries, retold

From Noah to Nuḥ: The Making of a Prophet 215
Biblical histories, embellishments and paraphrasing translations have seen the light. This milieu, consisting of Judaism and Eastern Christianity as well as of a plethora of Jewish-Christian currents and ‘sects’, forms the lens through which the Qurʾān and the post-Qur’anic stories, the Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ, perceive the patriarchs and prophets. This is not to say that these stories were always communicated in written form by adherents of those religions: oral stories and testimonies of converts to Islam may have been responsible for it as well. Neither should we think of a slavish adoption of these stories by Islam. It can be proven that these stories were subjected to a highly creative process of Islamization. Scholarly theories about a Jewish original, copied by Islam, but sometimes only half understood, betray a biased perspective, which does not reckon with this process of Islamization. In spite of that, the quest for Jewish and Christian sources of the Islam remains indispensable in order to understand this process of Islamization. As to Noah, the Qurʾān gives the impression that the audience of Muhammad had already been familiar with some basic elements of the stories about this figure. Hence the Qurʾān is not a revelation of stories that were totally unknown, but admonishes an audience by referring to moral examples that are more or less familiar to them. There is no doubt that all post-Qur’anic literature is heavily indebted to the Qurʾān itself. It can be proven, however, that pre-Qur’anic literature did have its share in shaping post-Qur’anic literature. By going backward from the Tales of the Prophets to pre-Islamic literature, this hermeneutical process of adopting and transforming existing stories may be clarified. By doing so, we will be able to offer a more refined explanation of the making of the Islamic Noah. For our purpose we will focus upon the episode of the preparation of the ark. The method of tracing the sources to their origin has been inspired by Geza Vermes’ generic research on midrash. Starting with a retold Biblical story, elaborately retold in late midrashic literature, he traces the way back to the Bible itself.3 Still, some of his presuppositions should be challenged, e.g. it is not certain that the later sources are the most elaborate. This becomes all the more essential when one wishes to cross the boundaries between Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Older studies are often limited to listing the sources, implicitly assuming a one-sided borrowing from Judaism by Islam.4 My research

will try to proceed further, while avoiding these traditional pitfalls.5 I will start then with the youngest literature and work our way back via the Qurʾān to Christian and Jewish sources subsequent to the Bible. It is not my aim to trace the transmission of motifs precisely from one author to another: this would require an exhaustive research of the whole early Islamic literature and the isnād chains (i.e. the list of authoritative transmitters). By choosing three different representative authors I will offer a sample of this literature, exemplified by Noah. Wherever I point out Jewish and Christian predecessors, I do not suggest a direct borrowing, but argue for ultimate influence upon our Islamic authors, often via earlier Islamic sources.6
2 The Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ on Noah
The Tales of the Prophets by al-Kisaʾī (approximately 13th century CE) contain quite a few embellishments and digressions of a miraculous nature. Although this collection obviously draws upon the Qurʾān and upon post-Qur’anic collections of stories, it contains motifs not found in previous collections.7
It is Gabriel who gave Noah the glad tidings of his prophethood and apostleship to his people. (. . .) Drawing near, the angel clothed Noah with the garb of God’s warriors, bound his head with the Turban of victory, girt him with the sword of Splendor and said: “Go to Darmesel son of Avel, son of Lamel and his people and call them to worship God”. Then he departed and ascended back into heaven. It turned out be one of their festivals. From the time of Cain (Qābīl) it was their habit to take out the idols, carry them on thrones and bring sacrifices. (. . .) After that they drank wine, beat tambourines, danced and unashamedly fornicated like beasts with the women.
When Noah cries that they have to obey God only, the idols topple from their pedestals and the king likewise falls from his throne. Angrily he orders Noah to

appear before him: “I am a messenger of the Lord of the Universe” (rasūl Rabbi al-Ālamīna), Noah states. Further on he explains: “All I need is for you to say that there is no god but God (Allah) and that I, Noah, am the messenger (rasūl) of God”. The differences with the Biblical account are striking indeed. The Bible does not know of a specific idolatrous cult practised by the people of the Flood, who are, moreover, not explicitly identified with pedigrees of Cain. Obviously, the theme of the feast serves to highlight their idolatrous, orgiastic behavior. The idols toppling from their pedestal is a motif that has been used centuries earlier to describe what happened when the child Jesus entered the land of Egypt (Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew 23). However, the motif is probably more directly derived from Muhammad’s cleansing of the Kaʿba from its 360 idols, as told in the ḥadith.8 Noah introduces himself with words that exactly parallel the Shahada, the Islamic confession of faith, except that Muhammad’s name is replaced by Noah’s. Noah is called the rasūl Allah. His vocation by the angel Gabriel parallels Muhammad’s own vocation, as told in the Sīra. The Qurʾān portrays Muhammad in colors and traits similar to Muhammad’s, as we will see, but here even the reverse takes place: Noah is described with traits belonging exclusively to Muhammad. The story continues by relating how Noah calls upon the people to worship God and to cease their disobedience. This he does for three centuries! However, Noah is beaten by women and children. Then he prays two rakʿas, begging that his patience may increase. In the fourth century, the people put their fingers in their ears and stone him. Noah is revived by the wings of birds sprinkling water on his face. The people consider Noah a madman. At the end Noah prays to God to destroy this people. Only then God commands him to build the ark, together with Gabriel and Noah’s children and faithful followers. The people mock: “You began to take up prophecy; now you have taken up carpentry. We complain of drought and you are building for a flood. All this is caused by your madness”. The people try to set fire to the ark, but cannot harm it. Worms, however, damage the ark until upon God’s behest Noah use four pegs upon which the names of Muhammad’s companions are written. Even then the people could have been saved as the ark itself started to speak: “There is no God but God and Noah is God’s prophet (nabī)”. Still, the people did not believe and Noah makes a pilgrimage (Hajj) and sees the Kaʿba. To protect the ark during his absence, angels lift it up into the sky. This whole event took place where now the mosque of Kufa stands. Noah’s family enters the Ark, together with Adam’s body.

The story is interspersed with miraculous events. Obviously Noah is strongly islamicized: as a Muslim he conducts the rakʿas and the hajj and passes by the Kaʿba. The mosque of Kufa (Iraq) still marks Noah’s doings, we are told. The story is even more Muhammadocentric than the Qurʾān: Noah’s stories are read and retold in the light of Muhammad’s experiences.9 Strikingly differing from the Biblical account is the emphasis upon the opportunity offered to the people to repent: no less than four centuries long. Still, at the end there is once more a call to repent. Noah is called both messenger and prophet, probably because the call to repent is considered the hallmark of prophecy. Searching our way back we come across Al-Thaʿlabī (11th century CE).10
3 Al-Thaʿlabī
Ibn Abbās11 told that there were two clans of the children of Adam, one in the plain and one upon the mountain.12 The women of the plain were beautiful, as were the men on the mountain. Iblis disguised himself as a lad and introduced some sort of shepherd’s flute, which formed the basis of a yearly festival full of immorality. God sent Noah, who was by then 50 years old, and he stayed with them for one thousand less fifty years, calling them to God and warning them.
9 I owe the term ‘Muhammadocentric’ to M. Accad, ‘Muhammad’s Advent as the Final Criterion for the Authenticity of the Judeo-Christian Tradition’, in: B. Roggema, M. Poorthuis, P. Valkenberg (eds), The Three Rings. Textual Studies in the Historical Trialogue of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, Leuven 2005, 217–236.

11 Ibn Abbās is a highly important spokesman of Isrāʾīlliyyāt from the 7th century CE, and Muhammad’s uncle. Whether this attribution can be trusted remains uncertain, as many stories were told in his name because of this reputation. See for Ibn Abbās: I. Wolfensohn, Kaʾb al-Aḥbar und seine Stellung im Ḥadīt und in der islamitischen Legendenliteratur, Jerusalem 1933, 42–47. 12 As we will point out further on, in Syriac Christianity this story is based upon a demythologizing interpretation of the “sons of God descending to the daughters of men” (Gen. 6). Hence not angels but descendants of Seth still living on the slopes of the Paradise mountain and later on descending to the children of Cain in the plain, are the protagonists. The first to introduce this explanation is the Christian author Julius Africanus, end second century CE.



From Noah to Nuḥ: The Making of a Prophet 219
Finally God revealed that no one would believe (Q. 11:36: “None of your people shall believe, but he who already believed”). Noah quotes the Qurʾān (71:24), in which he accuses them of idolatry for their statement: “Don’t give up your gods. Don’t give up Wadd, Suwāʿ, Yaghūh, Yaʿūq and Nasr. They have led many astray”.13 Noah planted trees in order to get the wood for the ark. After forty years he cut them down. Incidentally, this timespan cannot be counted as an opportunity to repent, for God had already stated that no one would repent any more. The people mock Noah when he starts to build the ark. They laughed at him and this was as he had said. “So he was building the ark and whenever a council of his people passed by him they scoffed at him. And Noah said: ‘If you scoff at us, we will surely scoff at you’ ” (Q. 11:38). When the Ark is finished, Adam’s body is brought into the Ark, serving as a barrier between the men and the women, according to Ibn Abbās. The structure of this account is different from al-Kisaʾī’s, as here the integration of the Qur’anic verses into the narrative is dominant. Both narratives know of a pagan festival, but al-Thaʿlabī offers an aetiological explanation both of the people – the mingling of the children of Cain and the children of Seth and of the festival itself. His emphasis upon the occasion to repent is similar to al Kisaʾī’s, but different in detail: Noah preaches for 950 years to the people (cp. Q. 29:14). There is less emphasis upon the miraculous in this account. Noah is not explicitly called a prophet.
4 Al-Ṭabarī
In a different genre, that of a world chronicle, al-Ṭabarī (839–923 CE) relates the story of Noah as well, sometimes in different versions. Unlike in his monumental commentary on the Qurʾān, he does not decide in his Taʾrikh (Chronicle) which version he deems correct. He aims at historical identifications. The people in Noah’s time committed wickedness and drank wine and were preoccupied with musical instruments rather than with God (I:184). In conformity with the Qurʾān (71:24), Noah accuses them of idolatry for their statement: “Don’t give up your gods. Don’t give up Wadd, Suwāʿ, Yaghūh, Yaʿūq and Nasr. They have led many astray”.
13 The same quotation can be found in al-Tabarī, Taʾrīkh (ed. De Goeje) I, 184; The History of al-Ṭabarī, From the Creation to the Flood (tr. F. Rosenthal), New York 1987, p. 354. The interpretation is difficult for it seems that the first line quotes the people themselves and the last line a critical voice, God, Muhammad or Noah.

Al-Tabarī (Taʾrikh I:185) offers several figures of how old Noah was when he, the first prophet, started to preach: 50 years, 350 years, 480 years. In any case he preached several decades, if not centuries. Then Noah plants a tree upon God’s command and after 40 years cuts it down. Passers-by ask him why he builds an ark on dry land. Noah waited generation after generation. The people started to choke him until he became unconscious. When he regained consciousness he prayed: “O God! Forgive my people for they do not know!” Finally he complained to God about their behavior and said: “My God! I have called my people night and day, but my calling has only made them shun me more” (Q. 71:5). ( . . ) “My Lord! Let no unbeliever stay on earth!” (Q. 71:26). People mock him and ask why he was first a prophet and now a carpenter. For the details of the ark, al-Ṭabarī refers to the people of the Torah. Al-Ṭabarī is less clear about the festival, but like al-Thaʿlabī he uses an aetiological explanation of musical instruments to explain the debauchery. Noah is molested but ready to forgive. It was only after more than hundred years at the least, that Noah begins to despair. Noah takes Adam’s body into the Ark where it serves as a barrier between the men and the women (I:193). There is a debate whether Adam’s body goes to a Cave or to Jerusalem (I:163). Al-Ṭabarī does not seem to be familiar with the story of the children of Seth on the mountain and the daughters of Cain on the plain. It means that al-Thaʿlabī must have used other sources than al-Ṭabarī only, with whose work he was probably acquainted.14 I will argue that here a crossing-over between Islam and Christianity must have taken place. Although I do not suggest that al-Thaʿlabī had direct access to the Christian document of the Cave of Treasures, there can be no doubt that ultimately his story goes back to it. The sons of Seth and the daughters of Cain play a leading role in it, whereas the Qurʾān does not refer to this episode at all.
5 The Christian Evidence
With the Cave of Treasures, a retelling of the Biblical story from the 6th century CE, containing older material from the 4th century CE,15 we enter the Christian

From Noah to Nuḥ: The Making of a Prophet 221
fold.16 This document attaches great importance to genealogical connections. Prophecy, kingship and priesthood are transmitted from Adam on, and his body has been brought from the Cave of Treasures to the ark. The evil on earth had been spread by the daughters of Cain, who, induced by demonic flutes made by Jubal and cymbals and tambourines made by Tubal-Cain, committed all kinds of debauchery. The old women were even more passionately enraged than the young ones and father and daughter and brother and sister mingled. The children of Seth became curious because of the noise and descended to mingle with them. The nude daughters of Cain threw themselves upon them like wild beasts. Noah remained celibate during 500 years, after which he married Haikal, Enoch’s granddaughter. God commanded Noah to build the ark, because after 130 years there would be the flood. Noah had to beat on the wood of the ark three times a day, to call the artisans to their work and to indicate the time to eat. The people would hear this sound and Noah had to tell them that God would send the flood. The interior of the ark mirrors the church: the separation between men and women, the orientation towards the East, the peace between the different inhabitants, the sacrifice of bread and wine, the body of Adam serving as bema, “all the mysteries of the Church were in the ark” (XVIII:3). The Cave of Treasures emphasizes again the warning to the people by mentioning 130 years during which there is the sound of hammering on wood. Hammering on wood is a habit still practised in some Eastern convents to call the people to the prayer service.17 There is, however, no mention of a reaction from the people, such as mocking or molesting Noah. The origin of the pagan atrocities is related extensively, without, however, suggesting that a festival had taken place. The children of Cain and of Seth are assumed to have mingled, which has caused the debauchery. Noah is not called a prophet, but his threefold ministry – priest, king and prophet – is implied via Adam, and will be transmitted until Christ at the end. Adam’s body will be brought to Jerusalem, to Golgotha. Adam’s body in Jerusalem is part of a profound Christian

theology in which Adam reaches salvation by contact with the redeeming blood of Christ. A document identical or strongly comparable to this one must have formed an important source of some of the Islamic accounts.18 Christian-Arabic translations of this document existed from the 7th century onward.19 Traces of the use of the Cave of Treasures have been documented in Islamic papyri from about 800 CE.20 All three authors quoted above seem to contain elements of the story as documented in the Cave of Treasures. Al-Ṭabarī and al-Kisaʾī know of the demonic origin of the flute. However, as stated above it is al-Thaʿlabī who shows the most striking parallels with the Cave of Treasures, such as the daughters of Cain, and the sons of Seth, the demonic musical instruments, and the transport of Adam’s body into the Ark (although he may have derived this motif from al-Ṭabarī). Fortunately, we can be somewhat more precise about the ways Islamic authors could have derived motifs from the Cave of Treasures. With the author al-Yaʿqūbī we tread on solid ground.
6 Al-Yaʿqūbī
Al-Yaʿqūbī (9th century CE), one of the earliest Islamic historians, has reworked the Cave of Treasures in his Kitāb al-Taʾrīkh into an Islamic story by condensing and removing all Christian elements, such as: the gold, myrrh and frankincense of Adam, his threefold ministry, the Ark as symbol of the Church, the sacrifice of bread and wine, and the ark making the sign of the cross.21 He maintained the motif of Noah as a celibate during 500 years, though.22 As Al-Yaʿqūbī knew Syriac, his source must have been the Syriac version of the Cave of Treasures
18 Later re-workings of the Cave of Treasures, such as S.C. Malan (ed.), The Book of Adam and Eve, or The Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, London 1882 (= A. Dillmann, Das christliche Adambuch des Morgenlandes, Göttingen 1853), should not be confused with the Cave of Treasures itself, as J.P. Lewis, A Study of the Interpretation of Noah and the Flood in Jewish and Christian literature, Leiden 1968, 34, n. 3 does. This latter document, which survived in Ethiopic, does not seem to have influenced our Arabic writers. 19 Su-Min Ri, Commentaire de la Caverne des Trésors, 63–66. 20 See N. Abbot, Studies in Arabic Literary Papyri I, Historical Texts, Chicago 1955, 38 ff. 21 See: G. Smit, Bijbel en legende bij den Arabischen schrijver Yaʾqubi, 9e eeuw na Christus, Leiden 1907; E.L. Daniel, ‘Al-Yaʾqūbī and Shiʾism reconsidered’, in: J.E. Montgomery (ed.), ʿAbbasid studies; Occasional Papers of the School of ʿAbbasid Studies, Leuven 2004, 209–239. 22 This motif is known in midrash and Christian sources (see J.P. Lewis, Study of the Interpretation., 35, n. 2). Its featuring in Islamic writers is best explained as derived from the Cave of Treasures, possibly via Yaʾqūbī.

and not an Arabic translation. His work may have been the source of all later Islamic authors using motifs that parallel the Cave of Treasures.23 In fact, his work shows a consistent attempt to harmonize the Qur’anic account with the story of the Cave of Treasures, although he uses less explicit quotations from the Qurʾān than our authors quoted above. The most conspicuous difference is that the Qurʾān portrays Noah as preaching to “his people”, whereas the Cave of Treasures speaks about the mixed race of sons of Seth and daughters of Cain. Hence, it is plausible that Islamic authors such as al-Ṭabarī and especially al-Thaʿlabī have used al-Yaʿqūbī as their source for a story identical or highly similar to the Cave of Treasures. These authors face the challenge to integrate this source together with the sometimes disparate verses of the Qurʾān about Noah into one coherent story. The absence of specific Christian elements in these Islamic authors is best explained by pointing to al-Yaʿqūbī’s version, in which the Christian elements have already been removed. Having stated this thus far, we have answered the question of the origin of the embellishments of the Noah story in post-Qur’anic literature. However, the Islamic motif of Noah preaching like a prophet and offering the people ample time to repent can be found in the Qurʾān itself. This motif is itself not caused by a parallel to Muhammad’s preaching – although it certainly reinforces that motif – but it ultimately stems from earlier Christian or Jewish sources as well. We have not yet answered why especially Christian sources put such an emphasis upon Noah preaching like a prophet. To answer that question, we have to address ourselves to another Syriac source: Ephrem the Syrian.
7 Ephrem Syrus
Ephrem Syrus (4th century CE) is often considered as a writer akin to the Cave of Treasures.24 Still, in his Commentary on Genesis he puts the emphasis quite differently, although some details are similar. He relates how the sons of Seth mingled with the daughters of Cain. Then he quotes the Bible:
The Lord saw that the wickedness of man had become great on earth (Gen. 6:5).
23 Still we do not know whether the earlier traces of the Cave of Treasures in Islamic papyri have constituted a whole document. Several trajectories are possible, even when we leave out the possibility of oral communication. 24 Su-Min Ri, Commentaire de la Caverne des Trésors, claims that Ephrem has used the Cave of Treasures.



224 Poorthuis
Then Ephrem quotes a Biblical verse that requires an elaborate explanation:
The Lord said: I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made man (6:7).
This verse might suggest that God had been mistaken. Hence Ephrem continues: not because God did not see this beforehand, but He wanted to reveal the wickedness for the generations to come. God, who does not know remorse, was brought to remorse by their wickedness. Moreover, God hoped that the people would feel remorse upon hearing that the Being that does not know remorse would have remorse, in Ephrem’s highly paradoxical statement. In other words, God’s initiative was not a prediction, but was meant to bring the people to repentance. Noah built the ark in a hundred years and during that whole period the people did not repent. On the contrary, they mocked Noah: “How can animals and birds be brought together from all directions of the earth?” The animals were brought together in a miraculous way, but even then the people did not repent. Then God spoke: “About seven days I will destroy all flesh that I have made” (Gen. 7:4). Even now God offered them postponement. Initially they had been granted a postponement of 120 years (cp. Gen. 6:3), but because of the bad experience of 100 years this period was shortened by 20 years. Even that was beneficial, for it implied that the sinners were 20 years less guilty. With Ephrem we enter a wholesale theological debate about God’s justice. Ephrem seems to defend himself against an imaginary opponent, who accuses God of being not all-knowing, of knowing remorse about decisions, and of being eager to destroy mankind. Ephrem emphasizes how much time the people have received: 100 years (although the Bible according to Ephrem’s reading had even promised 120 years).25 Noah’s situation hardly receives any attention: he is not molested and his despair is hardly mentioned. Ephrem offers an exegesis of Scripture in the same way the Islamic authors al-Ṭabarī and al-Thaʿlabī offer an exegesis of the Qurʾān. The calculation of the periods is derived from Scripture by an ingenious exegesis. Like al-Thaʿlabī, Ephrem explicitly links the descent of the sons of God to the daughters of man with the Flood, in a highly similar explanation, but of course here connected to exegesis of Scripture, i.c. Genesis 6:1. Still, Ephrem is far more theologically pre-occupied than the Islamic authors.
25 Cp. Aphraat, Demonstratio II.9 and VII:8.



From Noah to Nuḥ: The Making of a Prophet 225
Who may have been Ephrem’s imaginary opponent? There is no doubt that he was thoroughly acquainted both with Marcion and with Valentinian Gnostics, who exercised their influence from the second century CE onward.26 Both considered the flood an act unworthy of the highest god. According to Marcion, the god of the Old Testament is the creator-Demiurge and a just lawgiver, but should be distinguished from the loving Father of Christ. This unknown god of love has nothing to do with creation and commandments. Irenaeus reports that, according to Marcion, the rebels against the Demiurge such as Cain, the generation of Sodom and the Egyptians, will be saved by Christ, whereas Abel, Enoch and Noah will not share in the salvation (Adversus haereses I:27,3).
The Gnosis knew of an even a more aggressive condemnation of the Flood and of Noah. Curiously, Noah’s wife, who is portrayed as disobedient to God in the Qurʾān (66:10), features also in Gnostic texts. Precisely because of her obstruction in building the Ark, the Gnosis considers her far superior to Noah himself. By setting fire to the Ark, she resists a lower god (archon), who wants to destroy her and mankind. This lower god repents and is revengeful: thus his Gnostic epithets: unknowing, foolish, blind and jealous. Noah’s wife is aware of the true gnosis (knowledge) of the highest hidden god. Apparently, the motif of the disobedience of Noah’s wife, known from the Qurʾān 66:10, existed already in the second century CE, to be transformed into a gnostic reversal.27 Of course, Christian rebuttals of this criticism of God’s behavior with the Flood can be documented in the same 2nd century as well. The emphasis upon Noah preaching repentance became stronger and stronger. A charming exegesis identifies the Greek Deucalion, who experienced a flood as well, with Noah: Δεῦτε καλεῖν (Deute kalein), “come to call”.28 Noah becomes the paragon of the prophet calling to repentance. Positive Christian interpretations of Noah remain even after the Gnostic threat has become something of the past.
26 Ephrem wrote several anti-Marcionic tracts. See: C.W. Mitchell (ed.), S. Ephraim’s Prose Refutations of Mani, Marcion and Bardaisan, Oxford 1912.

8 Jewish Evidence
Pre-rabbinic Jewish interpretation of Noah, as can be found in the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus and in Philo, is outspokenly positive. Here no polemic with Marcion or Gnosis plays a role yet; Philo and Josephus want to present Noah in a favorable light vis-à-vis their non-Jewish audience.29 Similar to the later rabbinic midrash, they already insert the concept of repentance to heighten the ethical plausibility of God’s actions. Philo argues that the seven days of delay after entering the Ark refer to God’s benevolence (Questions and answers on Genesis II:13). Josephus tells that Noah was displeased by their behavior and “persuaded them to change their dispositions and their acts for the better” (Antiquities I:3:74). Later on, Rabbinic literature would strongly emphasize the opportunity to repent, conforming with the overall approach of rabbinic literature to insert repentance wherever possible.30 The 120 years mentioned in Gen. 6:3 were in fact the timespan offered for repentance, the Rabbis and Church Fathers maintain.31 Already 1 Peter 3:20 emphasizes the ‘long suffering’ of God regarding the generation of the Flood.32 Islamic authors use a wide array of sources, among which there are definitely Jewish ones. The preaching Noah, mocked by his audience, familiar already from the Qurʾān, is attested in Rabbinical sources as well:
Noah planted cedars. Passeers-by asked him: “Why do you plant trees?” He answered: “God wants to bring a flood over the world and said to me to build an ark so that I and my house can find refuge”. They laughed at him and mocked him because of his words. (. . .) When they did not repent, God brought the flood over them (Midrash Tanḥuma Noah 5, cp. Gen. Rabba 30:7).
The preaching Noah and the mocking people are highly similar to the picture in the Qurʾān (Q. 11:38), which is quoted by post-Qur’anic authors as well. The planting of the cedars is not mentioned in the Qurʾān, but both al-Ṭabarī and

Grypeou & H. Spurling, The Book of Genesis in Late Antiquity, Leiden 2013, 147–198 (the Flood story in Jewish and Christian exegesis), 176. This book offers inter alia a splendid overview of Jewish and Christian views of Noah. The Marcionite and Gnostic influences are, however, somewhat neglected.



From Noah to Nuḥ: The Making of a Prophet 227
al-Thaʿlabī relate how Noah plants a huge tree, which supplied the wood for the Ark.33 Although, according to Rabbinical literature, Noah preaches ample time before the Flood itself rises, some statements portray Noah in a rather unfavorable light. Noah was righteous, but only in comparison with his wicked generation (Bab. Talmud Sanhedrin 108 a). The Biblical text: “I repent that I made them and Noah found grace in his eyes” (Gen. 6:7–8) is read as: “I repent that I made them ànd Noah” (Gen. Rabba 28:8). Probably because of the Christian appreciation of Noah as uncircumcised and as father of mankind, especially of the nonJews, Jewish texts may have reacted by downplaying Noah.34 Christian texts could not afford themselves a critical attitude to Noah because of Marcionite and Gnostic criticism of Noah. Islamic texts are also outspokenly favorable to Noah.
9 The Two Motifs from the Syriac Cave of Treasures
Although the absence of Christian elements in Islamic authors might be explained by pointing to those Jewish sources that are positive about Noah, another trajectory to account for the Jewish elements in the Islamic interpretations of Noah is plausible as well. It is clear that the Cave of Treasures itself has been influenced by Jewish midrash. In a creative transformation, it uses Jewish stories to proclaim the Christian truth.35 Islamic authors may have taken over many motifs from this Christian document, transforming, adapting and curtailing it until it fitted their Islamic narrative. However, the preaching Noah and the mocking people may have been derived from the Qurʾān directly. The planting of a tree/trees may have been derived from Jewish midrash. This cannot be maintained, however, for two other important narrative motifs: the sons of Seth descending towards the daughters of Cain, and the transfer of Adam’s body into the Ark. The motif of the sons of Seth and the daughters of Cain points to a strong influence of the Cave of Treasures upon Islamic authors, especially upon al-Thaʿlabī. The “Sons of God” are interpreted in Jewish sources such as Pirke de
33 This motif is less prominent in the Cave of Treasures. 34 Another Rabbinic device to counter Christian claims is to present Noah as born circumcised (Tanḥuma Noah 5).
35 E.g. Adam as priest, prophet and king has its Jewish precedent in Moses as priest, prophet and king (see Philo, Life of Moses II.1), but in this text, these themes will be connected to Christ via the frankincense, the myrrh and the gold.



228 Poorthuis
rabbi Eliezer as fallen angels, in conformity with older Jewish explanations as found in 1 Enoch and related sources. Only some centuries after midrash Pirke de rabbi Eliezer (9th century), Jewish writers explicitly quote the Christian interpretation of the sons of Seth descending towards the daughters of Cain.36 Hence the Christian Syriac Cave of Treasures must have been the ultimate source of Islamic writers who use this motif, probably via earlier Islamic transmitters. In addition, the central event related both by Christian and by Islamic sources of the removal of Adam’s body from the Cave of Treasures into the Ark (and, according to Christian sources, later on to the place of Golgotha), has no Jewish counterpart either. Adam’s body is not carried into the Ark according to Jewish tradition! Hence there is no doubt that in these cases the Christian Syriac text of the Cave of Treasures has been the main source of Islamic writers, such as al-Thaʿlabī and al-Ṭabarī. The debate in al-Ṭabarī whether the body will finally rest in Jerusalem points to a close proximity to Christian traditions. Adam’s body in Jerusalem is, as we have noted, an essential element in Christian theology. Of course this has been suppressed by Islamic tradition, but the motif of Adam’s body in the Ark and even his transport to Jerusalem has survived. The fact that both these writers draw upon the Cave of Treasures, but in different ways, and that al-Thaʿlabī cannot be dependent upon al-Ṭabarī in the case of the sons of Seth and the daughters of Cain,37 proves that the Cave of Treasures has served as a source of inspiration for Islamic writers several times.
10 Conclusion
The foregoing allows for the following reconstruction:
1. The Hebrew Bible on Noah does not mention explicitly the possibility of repentance. Early Jewish and Christian literature inserted the concept of
36 See: Grünbaum, Neue Beiträge, 75. Some early traces of the identification of the “sons of God” with “noble men” may be detected in Gen. Rabba 26:5, but the relationship with the sons of Seth coming from the mountain is not developed. The Jewish Chronicles of Jerahmeel, a ‘retold Bible’, not before the 12th century, documents the story of the daughters of Cain and the Sons of Seth explicitly (XXIV:11). Because of its contrast with the rest of this midrash, which draws upon the “sons of God” as angels, this may well be interpolated from a Christian document. Cf. Grypeou & H. Spurling, Book of Genesis in Late Antiquity, 147–198 (the Flood story in Jewish and Christian exegesis), esp. 185. 37 For a more general comparison between al-Ṭabarī and al-Thaʾlabī and the differences between their respective stories, see: Wolfensohn, Kaʾb al-Aḥbar, 68.

repentance to stress the prophetic nature of Noah’s behavior. In contrast, the people’s reaction, mocking Noah, was introduced. 2. Because of Marcionite and Gnostic criticism of God’s behavior, Christian tradition strongly developed this appeal to repentance. 3. Rabbinic literature likewise stressed the concept of repentance, but allowed itself more criticism of Noah, due to the Christian extolling of Noah as a type of Christ and as an uncircumcised father of the gentiles. 4. Christianity developed the (possibly embryonic Jewish) idea of the sons of Seth on the mountain mingling with the daughters of Cain in the plain as an exegesis of Genesis 6. 5. Syriac Christianity became heir both of the emphasis upon repentance against Marcionite and gnostic disparagement of God’s behavior, and of the explanation of the Sons of god as sons of Seth upon the mountain slopes of paradise, descending to mingle with the daughters of Cain, the latter reveling in demonic music, debauchery and walking nude. 6. Islamic authors from the 9th century onward harmonized these accounts with the Qur’anic account of the people mocking Noah. The exegesis of Genesis 6:1 had lost their significance and likewise the polemic with Marcion and Gnosis in that context.38 Instead, the embellishments of the Noah story became a parallel story to Muhammad’s experiences with his preaching. 7. Whereas al-Ṭabarī displayed already some elements from pre-Qur’anic Syriac traditions, it is al-Thalabī who integrated most of the Syriac narrative tradition into a single whole, interspersed with Qur’anic quotes. Al-Kisaʾī showed less traces of the Cave of Treasures, but developed a Muhammadocentric reading of the story of Noah. The integration of earlier narrative elements and a ‘Muhammadocentric’ reading of earlier Christian traditions, by removing all too ‘Christian’ elements, can be considered as a creative re-reading of older traditions in the light of the Qurʾān, in order to achieve their Islamization.
38 Still, Islamic anti-heretical tracts do refer to Marcion. See: M. Frenschkowski, ‘Marcion in arabischen Quellen’, in: G. May & K. Greschat (eds), Marcion und seine kirchengeschichtliche Wirkung, Berlin 2002, 39–63.

An Early Modern Young Prophet: The Heavenly Messages of Evert Willemsz Bogaert and their Recognition, 1622–23
Willem Frijhoff
Prophecy, as is well known, has never been limited to adults or to gender roles, to religious trends, geographic areas, or specific time periods. From the viewpoint of the cultural historian, prophecy is the (mostly individual) expression of a strong, often dramatic concern about the future that aims at alerting a community and persuading them to change their life-style or their views and values, by appealing to a higher, ultimate authority. As a rule, a prophet has an acute sense of what goes on in his or her community. He or she benefits from a pre-existing readiness to believe the messenger and to adopt the views on past, present and future brought up by the prophet. The more so as prophets tend to frame their message in a familiar symbolic language that by its timeless content and its references to former instances of successful prophecy resists the wear of time and makes the message credible. But structures of credibility are always embedded in the practical forms which communication adopts in a given time and space. It is precisely the topical form taken by the prophet’s agency in the communicative process that interests the historian. In this contribution I want to present and briefly analyse a case of early modern prophecy that shows with a particular clarity how such prophets benefit from the preexisting structures and symbolic language of prophetic agency and capitalize on the current affairs of their religious and secular communities.1
1 An Unprivileged Youngster
During the summer of 1622 and the following winter, the small Holland town of Woerden on the Rhine was buzzing with rumours. A fifteen year old boy called Evert Willemsz [Evert, son of Willem], native of the town, had been assailed by a sudden illness, physical problems, and a spiritual experience. He claimed to

Frijhoff, R. Muchembled, Prophètes et sorciers dans les Pays-Bas aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles, Paris 1978, 263–362.

communicate, through an angel, with his heavenly Father. The boy lived at the local orphanage, together with his older brother Pieter and two younger halfbrothers. Cornelis (d. 1669), their eldest brother, probably trained as a tailor, lived nearby in town. Evert’s family name was Bogaert, but as a literate man he later used only its Latin form Bogardus – so at Leiden University, where he matriculated in 1627, and in the small, newly founded town of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan, present-day New York, where in 1632 he finally was appointed a minister of God’s Holy Word. He worked there, in the immense territory that was his parish, until his sudden, unexpected death in a shipwreck in September 1647, on the way back to his fatherland for the settlement of a long-standing quarrel with the governor of the colony. By then, he was only 40 years old.2 The family members he left in the new world – his own four young sons, his Scandinavian wife Annetgen Jans, and her five surviving children from a previous marriage – may have been aware of his prophetic past in Holland, but apparently they have not cherished it in their historic memory. His troublesome American life course, with its own prophetic accents, had become for them a memorable event in its own right. We have no certain information concerning Evert’s parents. He presumably lost his natural father Willem Bogaert when he was very young. He was certainly educated by his stepfather Muysevoet, who must have died, just as Evert’s natural mother did, some years before the onset of the boy’s spiritual

experience, perhaps in the plague year of 1617–18. The four younger sons were then put in the town orphanage of Woerden. As the administration of the Woerden orphan chamber makes no mention of any property, the family must have been without means. Other members of his stepfather’s family are known to have been small artisans, mostly shoemakers. Evert’s stepfather, too, may have been involved in one of the wooden trades, as a carpenter perhaps, a cabinet-maker, or a cooper. Without parents or a local family, without money or property, and without any proper education, the boy’s chances of climbing the social ladder were virtually non-existent. But Evert had something else; he had intelligence, and he had faith. And he was able to secure the recognition of his heavenly messages by capitalizing on a local network of co-religionists and sympathizers.
2 Bodily Experience and Heavenly Messages
We know what happened to Evert Willemsz in 1622–23 from two contemporary pamphlets, reprinted several times.3 Their initial editor was Lucas Zas (c. 15911636), the headmaster of the small local grammar school, and an eye-witness of the events. In a certain sense, however, the pamphlets’ author was Evert himself, for the text consists largely of the messages he wrote down during his spiritual experience, when he was temporarily smitten with deafness and dumbness (see the diagram). At this time, he communicated with the people around him via written notes, referred to in the pamphlets as ‘copies’ (kopije, i.e. literal transcripts), and printed in a larger font. Some slips of paper contained the questions and answers pertaining to a dialogue held between Evert and those who came to discuss with him. Other notes contained the spiritual messages, which he had written down on impulse, following an angel’s appearance or an ecstatic experience. Evert’s own version of the summer experience of 1622, written down some weeks afterwards in two long hymns, was also included.

234 Frijhoff
In order to understand the first calling of the later minister, we have to examine what happened to the boy in the spring of 1622. Having completed his elementary education, and while continuing to live in the orphanage, Evert was apprenticed to Master Gijsbert Aelbertsz, a tailor who had a workshop a few streets away, on the river Rhine. The orphanage and the workshop were distinct sites, but they were quite similar in atmosphere. Evert had virtually fulfilled his two-year apprenticeship with this master, whom he loved greatly for his piety and for his readiness to discuss God’s Word during their work together. It may have been this very companionship that revealed to him his true vocation: to be not a tailor, but a minister of the Word. According to the story in the pamphlets, Evert had for some time been seriously ill. He had hardly recovered when other physical symptoms made their appearance. During the nine days between 21 and 30 June 1622 he neither ate nor drank. He even isolated himself from the community. Evert’s refusal to attend the common meals, which served as a daily aggregation ritual for the community, was for him the most efficient way to gain the attention of both the orphans and the trustees. The pamphlets show clearly how concerned the matron of the orphanage was about his well-being, and illustrate her embarrassment concerning the disarray in the group caused by Evert’s dealings with heaven. This first phase of physical isolation was followed by a second phase, which lasted 70 days, from 30 June to 8 September. Evert suddenly became both deaf and dumb. He could neither hear nor speak, and occasionally even lost his sight, ‘as also for a long time the proper use of his reason’. This phase of physical paralysis, the loss of almost all his senses, suggests a slowly intensifying spiritual struggle, leading naturally to a crucial moment of transition. It also prepared Evert for a third, ecstatic phase, which again lasted nine days, from 8 to 17 September 1622. Evert began fasting again; still he could neither hear nor speak. This final phase began with the appearance of an angel of the Lord, and ended with a second visitation. This double appearance points to the true meaning of this episode, that is: communication with heaven. The angel delivered to him a message from the Father (Evert’s heavenly Father, who had taken the place of his earthly father): he had to convert people and warn them to repent and renounce their sins. According to the angel, the heavenly source of the message and the veracity of Evert’s encounter with heaven would be proven by his deliverance from the physical disabilities God had visited upon him, and by his full recovery. Incidentally, the angel also conveyed a second message, meant for Evert himself. On September 17th, just before his first redemption from illness, he wrote the following message:



An Early Modern Young Prophet 235
I hope that God will release me this night so that I may again hear and again speak: I do not know this by myself, but through the Spirit of God, which will enlighten me. [. .] If He has the power to inflict things upon me, He also has the power to deliver me again: for do we not read in God’s word that He made the deaf hear, the blind see, the crippled walk, the dumb speak [Mt. 11:5; 15:30]? [. .] Does He not then have the power to give back two of my five senses? Oh yes, I have had that trust and I still have it. As soon as I have recovered my speech and my hearing, it pleases God and the Spirit of God that I go to school until the time has come for me to do the work through which I shall be blessed. I intend then to become a minister and nothing else. Then you will see what the Spirit of God will work through me. I no longer must sew, once I have finished my clothes; for it pleases God almighty and the Spirit of God that such shall no longer be my work. I must fear the Lord, as the angel of the Lord has commanded me, and this I must do.
After the angel’s first appearance, Evert went into a kind of trance, a long period of ecstatic writing. For days on end he wrote down his heavenly communications on little slips of paper, mostly simple messages of a repetitious nature:
Spread the word, spread the word, for God is sorely displeased that word of his wondrous works is not spread. Oh spread the word, oh my dear friends, I beg of you, spread the word, for God is displeased that his divine things are not communicated throughout the whole world. Spread the word, then, oh spread the word.
The message was as simple as the outlook on the world of a young tailor’s apprentice could be. He repeated it throughout the pamphlets. There are good men and bad; God wants the good to repent; therefore, his word must be spread, and the signs read. In the background we can detect a very simplified form of belief in double predestination, as defended by orthodox Calvinism and confirmed three years earlier by the Synod of Dordrecht. It resembled the everyday theological discussions at grassroots level in Woerden, which crop up in documents concerning the confessional struggles in that deeply divided town and whose message was: the bad are damned and the good elect, but God will punish even the good if they do not publicly behave as his flock of perfect believers.



236 Frijhoff
3 Legitimizations
Evert’s messages were easily legitimized for the faithful, because the signs of God’s wrath were quite near: repeated plagues, scarcity (implying famine), and war. This traditional triad was presaged by the famous comet of 1618 (the comet of Halley), interpreted as God’s ‘rod’. But the most important sign of all in Woerden was, of course, ‘God’s wondrous work’ in his faithful child Evert Willemsz, as the second pamphlet about his agency announces it proudly in its title. Having first smitten him with sickness and deprived him of the use of his bodily functions, He would now sovereignly deliver him at a moment of His own choosing, announced by an angel. To believe in the truth of Evert’s spiritual experience was, therefore, to believe in God’s work in his elect. Evert had no doubt about his own election. The affliction which God had brought upon him proved it: God afflicts the one He loves. Evert felt akin to Christ, who too had suffered for his Father but had finally reconciled his will to God’s will (Lk. 22:42). He stated his firm confidence to belong to the 144,000 elect who would sing the hymn of the Lamb (Rev. 14:1–5; 15:3). But unlike some other contemporary prophets, he did not take the place of Christ. Although he may have been tempted by the role of a divine mediator, in the end he remained in his human place, as a simple messenger and minister of God. Evert’s texts reveal a form of youthful radicalism that related well with the strong positions taken by the Calvinist adherents of the double predestination who dominated the Reformed community in Woerden. However, he was not naive. He followed the apocalyptic mainstream of orthodox Protestantism but kept his eyes fixed upon his own destiny. He utilized current conventions to achieve autonomy. He willingly used church and civil authority to attain his divine calling, but he refused to become the unresisting victim of higher powers. In fact, Evert’s first spiritual experience and the events related to it had not exceeded the limits of the orphan community, and he needed a wider audience. But of course his activities drew attention in the town, all the more so since the young man had now found a convinced supporter in Master Lucas Zas, who helped him to voice his experiences and to realize his calling. Master Zas had worked as a teacher of Latin and French at Utrecht, the old capital of the former bishopric, and in the nearby small town of Montfoort. He probably taught Evert French after school time, as was customary for gifted boys attending the Latin grammar school. Apart from publishing the two pamphlets related to Evert, he also wrote a play on parental responsibility for children’s education and the choice of a profession, Borgerlijcke Huyshoudingh (Rotterdam 1628). This pious play includes a panegyric on the sacred ministry,



An Early Modern Young Prophet 237
which may have inspired young Evert’s views on his own ecclesiastical calling. In 1631, Zas edited a rhymed translation of Juan Luis Vives’ rules of life, the Introduction to True Wisdom. In the introductory poems, he overtly criticized the hypocrisy of the new Calvinist elites. In his person, neo-Stoicism and the Bible came together. Master Zas was Woerden’s independent intellectual, the ideal partner for the independent believer Evert must have been: a convinced Calvinist, but always insisting on his own responsibility in the design of his life. Zas came running whenever Evert had him called; he collected the messages and had them printed. He understood what was happening. Evert had good reason to choose headmaster Zas; his call to repentance was intended for outsiders, but for his real calling, the sacred ministry, he had first to attend the Latin school before being able to matriculate at the Theological College or the University at Leiden. By joining the headmaster, Evert used the impact which the event made on the local community to give his life a new direction. However, to be credible, Evert’s calling had to be legitimated above all by a higher authority. This legitimization, as announced by an angel of the Lord, was to take place through a ritual of redemption. For Evert, the healing process was the expression of his supernatural calling made visible to man. Evert’s first redemption took place nine days after the beginning of his ecstatic experience – a spiritual metaphor of the nine months of gestation preceding his rebirth as a Christian convert. Evert himself spoke of his ‘shedding the old Adam, in order to begin a new life, in all virtue and godliness’. He adopts here a characteristically pietistic idiom, in which illness was closely linked to sin, just as recovery was to conversion from a sinful life – to the regeneration of the old Adam as a true Christian, instigated solely by the Holy Ghost. Evert, then, was spiritually reborn in a way similar to his physical birth fifteen years before. In the almighty God, who caused his rebirth, he recognized his new and only father. The place of this rebirth was the orphanage, where the orphans, the matron, and rector Zas stood around him. Singing together Psalm 100, they helped to bear his spiritual birth pains, as he had predicted in one of his notes. Carried away by the dynamics of the ritual, all of a sudden Evert found himself singing with them. He had recovered his powers of speech and hearing, and was now completely his previous self, reborn as a new Adam. Three days later, the magistracy of Woerden, convinced that God Himself supported Evert’s words, authorized him to leave the tailor’s shop and to attend the Latin school, without having to earn his own living any more.

4 Community Involvements
In itself, Evert’s message was not, of course, sufficient to win the unconditional trust of all the people around him. Evert’s spiritual dealings provoked scepticism and resistance in town. As the boy himself pointed out in several messages, critics threatened to beat his deafness and dumbness out of him. In fact, Woerden was not in all respects an average Dutch town. It was a profoundly divided town, torn apart by three competing confessions: Lutheranism, liberal Arminianism, and orthodox Calvinism, the latter established only three years before at the Synod of Dort (1618–19). Confronted with two oppositional groups, who both claimed precedence and good faith and were probably much more numerous, but invested with the secular power in the town since the political intervention of the stadtholder, prince Maurice of Orange, in September 1618, the orthodox Calvinists were badly in need of a justification of their claims. Within this religious context, Evert’s spiritual experience was bound to be interpreted in a partisan way as that of an orthodox believer. We do not know for certain whether his parents were orthodox Calvinists, but the Woerden orphanage functioned as one of the main agencies of Calvinization. Evert’s elder brother Cornelis Bogaert frequented orthodox circles at Leiden. He married the sister of a radical young Calvinist with a Flemish background, Cornelis Paludanus who in his adolescence actively combated Arminianism at Woerden, taught himself theology, and obtained a parish near Woerden. Evert’s younger half-brother Pieter Muysevoet became an orthodox schoolmaster in the nearby village of Linschoten. Evert himself obtained in 1632 his ministry at New Amsterdam because he was a favourite of the orthodox party within the West India Company and within the Amsterdam consistory, which then had the authority to appoint ministers in churches overseas. Young Evert may have been inspired by his relative Paludanus’ fervour, but he was astute enough to reject the difficult path of the self-taught theologian. He claimed admission to the grammar school and the university, which would permit him to quit the small, narrow-minded community of Woerden Calvinism and spread his wings in the larger world, first on the Gold Coast in Africa (the Coast of Guinea, present-day Ghana), then in America. In fact, Evert and his two brothers must have felt close to a zealous Calvinist minister called Vincent Muysevoet or Meusevoet (1560–1624), probably a brother of their (step)father and therefore their uncle. He was the son of a Flemish shoemaker, who, as a convinced Calvinist, had fled in exile to Norwich in England, just like many other fellow Protestants. Back in Holland in 1586, Vincent served, first, as a minister at Zevenhoven near Woerden, and then at Schagen near Alkmaar, where he terrorized the Arminians.



An Early Modern Young Prophet 239
Between 1598 and his death in 1624 Vincent Meusevoet translated more than thirty Puritan and pietistic treatises from English into Dutch, including virtually all the writings by the famous Puritan divine William Perkins (1558–1602), three by the Genevan theologian Theodorus Beza (1519–1605), and several others by King James I. In 1621, immediately preceding Evert’s spiritual experience, Vincent published his own translation of the apocalyptic treatise Apocalypsis Apocalypseos (Latin version: Frankfurt 1609; earlier English translations: Amsterdam 1611 and 1615) by the influential Puritan theologian Thomas Brightman (1562–1607) who has been called one of the ‘high priests of chiliasm’. Directly or indirectly, this erudite work, much read and commented upon in Puritan and pietistic circles, may well have influenced the young boy’s prophetic orientation. Indeed, Meusevoet has played a leading part in introducing Puritan pietism in the Netherlands. Hence Evert’s familiarity with pietistic idiom and the Puritan doctrine of regeneration. He may as well have read Meusevoet’s translation (1599) of Perkins’ treatise on the spiritual meaning of sickness and death, and applied it to his own physical disabilities. In the second phase of his spiritual experience, Evert’s aim was no longer to promote himself as an agent of God, but to ensure the adherence of as many social groups as possible to his heavenly message. Indeed, as a candidate for adulthood he now had to submit himself to the public, reasoned acknowledgement of his fellow adults. In Woerden many still remained rather sceptical about what had happened to him. It was therefore vital that he finished his task by making his experiences credible to unbelievers. The second stage of his spiritual adventure was therefore more emphatically instrumental in character than the first, and the local community’s expectations were more heavily involved. Four months after his first regeneration, in the morning of Wednesday, 18 January 1623, Evert awoke with a severe headache. Refusing to eat or drink, he predicted that he would again lose the ability to hear and speak. This, indeed, occurred around noon. This time the loss of his senses lasted only three days. Evert’s experience was now more intense and more exhausting, and his message was passed on quickly enough. Surrounded by his fellow orphans Evert called one by one the representatives of the various social institutions within his horizon into a room that had been put at his disposal. Together they legitimized his actions before the whole town. First came the matron, as a representative of the household; then Evert’s older brother, as the next of kin and representative of the family; next, the rector of the Latin school, the main representative of literate culture in the town; subsequently, his former employer, the master tailor Gijsbert Aelbertsz; then the ruling mayor, the building contractor Jan Florisz van Wijngaarden;



240 Frijhoff
and, finally, in the name of the church council, minister Henricus Alutarius. The whole community in all its branches, lay and clerical, public and private, paraded symbolically past Evert’s chair. Evert’s second redemption was public in nature. It again occurred in the orphanage, though this time Evert announced it well in advance. He made certain that not only the rector but also both ministers were present – three qualified and critical witnesses. When, at a particular moment, he saw the other orphans writing and talking around the hearth fire (it was in the middle of a cold winter), his consciousness was reactivated. He wrote on a slip of paper that the rector and the ministers should be fetched, and then asked everybody present to sing a psalm – a most appropriate one indeed, apparently found by opening the Bible at random: ‘Out of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength . . .’ (Ps. 8:2). During the singing, Evert successively regained the use of his various senses until he left the state of babyhood mentioned in the psalm and sang along with the rector and the ministers as an adult. For the ministers, this was sufficient proof. Evert’s authenticity was warranted by the visible reality of God publicly intervening in the life of an individual, an event perceived, and hence sanctioned, by the community present. On the next day, a Sunday, Evert was allowed to read in church, before the whole congregation, the responses of the Heidelberg Catechism to Question 35, Sunday 14. This, again, was an appropriate text: ‘What do we call what is received from the Holy Ghost?’ Had Evert not repeatedly emphasized that the Holy Ghost was working through him? We may consider this reading as the final rite of passage by which Evert gained official entry into public life. From this point onwards, he was empowered to speak in public with adults. However, this confirmation of the change in the orientation of his life provoked again harsh criticism in Woerden town. Evert then played his last trump card. Two nights later, his two little brothers who slept next to him in the same bed, as well as the other orphans, were awakened by Evert talking aloud in his sleep. Someone went downstairs to fetch the matron. She anxiously woke Evert and asked him whether something was wrong. Evert calmed everyone down and persuaded them to go back to bed. He had hardly fallen asleep himself when he again started speaking out loud, as if he were dreaming. His brother Pieter Bogaert, five years older than he and also still an inmate of the orphanage (not to be confused with their younger half-brother Pieter Muysevoet), obviously understood what Evert was up to. He had a pen, a piece of paper and a candle ready at hand, and wrote down Evert’s long, rhymed message. Its beginning and end perfectly set the tone:



An Early Modern Young Prophet 241
Woe, oh woe, people who live in pride and excess, Oh, ye people mean and heartless, Your lives today are so godless. [. . .] And so that people know Through the work of God the Lord That through me they should repent.
This account of Evert’s dream brought the last Calvinist critics over into Evert’s camp. God Himself, as the author of dreams, here legitimated Evert’s spiritual experiences and the direction which he wanted to give to his life, and to his public mission. The next day, the burgomasters called the witnesses, including Evert’s brothers, before them, authenticated the story, and ordered the church council to have it published as quickly as possible in Amsterdam by an orthodox Calvinist bookseller. This bookseller was Marten Jansz Brandt (c. 1590–1649), the privileged printer of the party of the praxis pietatis but also of the newly founded West India Company, who had established his shop next to the city hall and the New Church under the telling sign ‘The Reformed Catechism’. And that, indeed, is what happened. The pamphlet even got a second printing at Amsterdam, and another version was issued some weeks later at Arnhem, the seat of the provincial government of Gelderland, where liberal and orthodox Calvinists also opposed each other fiercely.
