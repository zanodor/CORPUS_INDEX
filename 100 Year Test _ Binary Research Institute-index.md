100 Year Test | Binary Research Institute
In 1894 the Indian astronomer, Sri Yukteswar, wrote that the cause of
the moving equinox (a.k.a. precession observable) was the result of
our sunʼs orbit around another star. He estimated the orbit period at
24,000 years and put apoapsis at about 500 A.D., saying the change
in angular velocity (precession observable) would average 54” p/y
over the life of the orbit.
From Yukteswarʼs orbit parameters, and utilizing the same rate of
change numbers that Newcomb used for the period before 1900, we
can apply Keplerʼs laws to Yukteswarʼs orbit data (constrained by a
24,000 year orbit period and apoapsis at 500A.D.) to come up with a
forced eccentricity and expected rate of change for the 100 year
period between 1900 and 2000 of .000349 ́ ́p/y.
Yukteswar = .000349 ́ ́p/y
Newcomb = .000222 ́ ́p/y



Looking at Yukteswarʼs orbit driven model of precession versus
Newcombʼs local dynamics model of precession (both sets of data
were given within a few years of each other over 100 years ago), we
have an excellent long-term test of the two opposing models.
The actual rate of change for the precession observable (or change
in angular velocity traveled by the solar system along its binary orbit
path in the dynamic SS model – seen as a change in orientation to
the fixed stars) was .000346”p/y.
.000346 – .000349 = .000003 ́ ́
.000346 – .000222 = .000124 ́ ́
.000124 / .000003 = 41
Comparing Yukteswarʼs and Newcombʼs predictions to the actual we
find the dynamic SS model to be 41 times more accurate than the
lunisolar precession model over the last 100 years.
In this chart we have included precession calculations for 10 year
periods, over the last 100 years.



The first nine points are from Newcomb (or use Newcombʼs
methodology) and the last three are from the Astronomical Almanac.
The red line is a plot of the rate of increase (in arc length) required
for a body in a 24,000 year orbit (Dynamic Solar System Model).
Note the slope of the red line better fits the long term precession
observable compared to Newcombʼs calculations.
It is a given (in the right column) as the annual rate of precession
accelerates, the orbit period (or wobble cycle in lunisolor theory) will
decrease.
The ascending line is the plot one would expect to see if our sun
were in a binary orbit with a total period of 24,000 years and mild
eccentricity. Notice the historical data has a high correlation to our
hypothesized orbit period.
Lunisolar theory gives no good reason for the trend. A binary orbit,
conforming to the laws of elliptical orbits, is a logical explanation.
Change in arc length travelled p/y by a body in 24,000 year
elliptical orbit from1700 AD to 2100 AD
Change in arc length traveled p/y by a body in a 24,000 year
elliptical orbit from apoapsis, 500 AD, to periapsis, 12,500 AD.



Rate should range from a low of about 50” p/y to a high of about
62” p/y.
