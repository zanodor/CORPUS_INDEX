I can see the high-resolution map and I do not see any Vlachs or Romanians. I think the Romanians could consult with the Emperor why he forgot to mention them because this map was created from the Emperor’s work. I think the Romanians cannot blame the Emperor because we also do not have any other contemporary sources that mention any Vlachs in the Carpathian Basin at that time. The old authors were not silly. I see the medieval Byzantine authors know very precisely the day when the Emperor born and died, we could suggest they did precise work. This is also a very important state and strategy document, and we can see many details, many nations. In this map, we cannot see any Vlachs or Latins in the area of the former Dacia province (which is ceased 700 years before the time of Constantine), and this area is very close to the Byzantine Empire, but I see the mighty Byzantine Emperor knows many far countries like Franks, Russia, Caucasus, Syria, Persia, etc. It would be strange if there would be MANY or ANY Dacian or Vlach population, and he would not know this.
I know the Romanians would like to imagine themself as “the first super ancient” folk in the Carpathian Basin. But we know a rich and very detailed history about many nations in Europe (thousand of sources, documents, archeology, cemeteries, items, buildings, coins, battles, rulers...), comparing the rich history of other nations is very strange that the allegedly “super ancient” Romanians have no any historical sources in the Carpathian Basin at that time (and not somewhere else, I talking about the Carpathian Basin). As we can see even the Byzantine Emperor who ruled 46 years long does not know about the Romanians. I think if somebody is “super ancient” somewhere then he should have a lot of various sources about him that refer to him in that place.
I can see "Turcia", inside "Abares" (Avars), Moravia (Moravia used a 50 years gap after the Franks with the Bolgars destroyed the Avar state). "Turcae in octo gentes divisi" = "Eight nation of Turks". The contemporary Byzantine sources say Avars = Turks, Avars = Scythians, Hungarians = Turks, Hungarians = Scythians, King Attila = Scythian (Priscus) King Attila = Avar (Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus). The Byzantian called the Hungarians as “Turks”, because the religious cult, social structure, appearance was not different than the other Turk peoples at that time. (They were not FinnoUgric and not Mongols...)
Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote in the De Administrando Imperio that the Avars lived in the Carpathian Basin when the relative Hungarians arrived, and he calls Attila the king of the Avars:
"the Avars had their haunts on the far side of the river Danube, where now are the Turks (Hungarians)"
"But when Attila, the king of the Avars, came and utterly devastated and depopulated all the parts of Francia, all the Franks from Aquileia and from the other cities of Francia began to take to flight, and to go to the uninhabited islands of Venice and to build huts there, out of their dread of king Attila."
All old medieval Hungarian chronicles say Hungarians = Huns and Scythians, Attila is king of Hungary.
The contemporary other foreign sources say Huns = Avars = Hungarians or Huns = Scythians or Hungarians = Scythians.
According to Herodotus Agathyrsi who were a people of Scythian lived in the Carpathian Basin.

Priscus was on a diplomatic mission to the court of Attila the Hun. Priscus called Attila as a Scythian.
Priscus - Wikipedia
"Majestic meals were served to us and to the barbarian guests in silver bowls, but Attila ate nothing but fried on a simple wooden tray. He was similarly moderate in everything else, he drank from a wooden cup, while his guests drank a goblet of gold and silver. His clothes were also simple, he just needed his purity. Neither the sword he wore on his side, nor his Scythian footwear, nor the bridle of his horse were decorated unlike other Scythians who decorated them with gold, jewels or anything of value. The ground was covered with woolen rugs."
Jordanes embellished the report of Priscus, reporting that Attila had possessed the "Holy War Sword of the Scythians", which was given to him by Mars and made him a "prince of the entire world"
Jordanes - Wikipedia
Saint Jerome called the Huns Scythians and some Huns were Christian:
Saint Jerome, Confessor, Doctor of the church (342-420): "The Armenians have laid aside their quivers, the Huns are learning the psalter, the frosts of Scythia are warmed by the fire of faith. The ruddy flaxenhaired Getae carry tent-churches about with their armies; and perhaps the reason why they fight with us on equal terms is that they believe in the same religion."
Saint Jerome, Confessor, Doctor of the Church | EWTN
Hungarian chronicles say the Hungarian-speaking Szekelys are the remaining Huns in the Carpathian Basin.
Chronicon Pictum says about the Szekelys:
"They were afraid of the western nations that they would suddenly attack them, so they went to Transylvania and did not call themselves Hungarians, but Szeklers. The western clan hated the Huns in Attila's life. The Szeklers are thus the remnants of the Huns, who remained in the mentioned field until the return of the other Hungarians. So when they knew that the Hungarians would return to Pannonia again, they hurried to Ruthenia to them, conquering the land of Pannonia together."
We can see the Avars straight away after the Huns. The Huns came back as Avars. Avars 567-822

"It is said that after the defeat of the Romans, at that time the Avars sent messages to Tiberius and the delegated messenger said: "Well why dare you if your trouble you have a few people, to wage war against the Avars (who are Scythians too, I say), or you do not have writings and parchments, from which you would read to find out that the Scythian tribes are invincible and indestructible?" And Tiberius said in response..."
(Exc. de Leg. Rom. 7)
"After the Turks, who used to be called Saka, sent embassies to Justinian for peace, the emperor planned to have an embassy send it out to the Turks"
In this document the Turks mean the Avars, the Saka is a Scythian tribe.

The name Targitaos appears frequently as the name of an Avar chief in both Menander and Theophylact. This name is identical to the name of the ancestor of the Scythians recorded by Herodotus: Targitaus king of the Scythians.
The name of Targitaos is very similar to the Hungarian name of the sacred mount "Hargita" in Transylvania. This is the highest peak in Székely land and the main population is Székely, a Hungarian subgroup, according to the chronicles and folk memory the Székelys are the remaining Huns of Attila in the Carpathian Basin.

This was recorded by Paulus Diaconus in the year 596: "Hun, quoquae qui et Avares dicuntur" = "Hun, who also called Avars"
Pope Eugene II (824-827)
Pope Eugene II - Wikipedia
"Hunnia, quae et Avaria dicuntur"
Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum and the Chronicon Pictum mention the Avars, just not in this name, Hungarian chronicles talk about still the Huns during the Avar period.
"This Csaba is the legal son of Attila from the daughter of the Greek emperor Honorius, whose sons were called Edemen and Ed. When the Hungarians returned to Pannonia for the second time, Edemen was coming with the huge kinship of his father and mother, his mother was from the nation of Khwarazm/Chorasmia (White Huns/Hephthalites). And Ed stayed in Scythia with his father. The Aba clan originated from this Csaba. When Csaba went back to Scythia and he boasted the nobility of his mother in front of the community, the nobility of the Huns despised him, claiming that he is not a true offspring of the country of Scythia, but only such a foreign kind. Why he did not get a wife from Scythia, but he got a wife from the nation of Chorasmia."
In 788, the Avars (Einhard the biographer of the Frankish ruler Charlemagne called them Huns), invaded Friuli and Bavaria. For the next years, Charlemagne ravaged Pannonia many times. In 800, the Bulgarians under Khan Krum attacked the remains of the Avar state. In 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into Pannonia, defeating and bringing an end to the Avar confederation. In the same year, Charlemagne went to Regensburg where the Avar leaders acknowledged him as their ruler. In 805, the Avar khagan, who had already been baptized, went to Aachen to ask permission to settle with his people south-eastward from Vienna. The Transdanubian territories became integral parts of the Frankish realm, which was abolished by the Hungarians in 899–900.
The Frank chronicle names today Hungarian city "Sárvár" as "Sarwar" in the year 791 and 805. This is a pure Hungarian word. Sárvár = Mud + castle in Hungarian. This is 100 years before than tribes of Arpad's Hungarians conquered the Carpathian Basin. This data also proves the Avar-Hungarian continuity, as many other contemporary authors write Huns = Avars = Hungarians.

In the chronicle the Avar khagan calls "Theodorus khagan of the Huns", we can see he has a Christian name, because he was baptized. Sárvár city is located in west Hungary (Pannonia). In other languages this city has different names, Latin: Bassiana, German: Kotenburg / Rotenturm an der Raab, Slovene: Mala Sela.
Sárvár - Wikipedia
We can see the "vár" = castle (Burg in German) word in the name of many Hungarian settlements (as the "Burg" word is very usual among German settlements too). For example: Székesfehérvár, Nándorfehérvár, Gyulafehérvár, Vasvár, Balatonföldvár, Csákvár, Szigetvár...etc. The “vár” word has logically connected meanings in Hungarian.
The Romanian word “oraş” (city) originates from the Hungarian word “város” (city).

Leo VI The Wise Emperor of Byzantium (886–912) described the Hungarians this way (Book: The Taktika of Leo VI) „The Scythian nations are one, so to speak, in their manner of life and their organization; they have a multitude of rulers, and they have done nothing of value, living for the most parts as nomads. Only the nation of the Bulgarians, and also that of the Turks [Hungarians], give thought to a similar military organization, which makes them stronger than the other Scythian nations as they engage in close combat under one commander.”
It is relevant to note that none of the Hungarian medieval sources know about Avars, probably because they were not distinguished from the Huns as many foreign medieval sources also identified Avars with Huns, for example the Avars who were Christianized and became tax-payer vassals of the Eastern Frankish Empire were called as Huns in 871.
Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum (871) called the Avars as Huns, who are Christians and live in Pannonia.
Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum - Wikipedia
"So far it has been recorded how the Bavarians became Christians, and the list of the bishops and abbots of the Salzburg Archbishopric has been compiled. Now it must be added how the Slavs, who are also called Carantans and their neighbours received teaching in the Holy Faith and how they became Christians, and the Huns drove out the Romans, the Goths and the Gepids from Pannonia Inferior, and held it until the Franks and the Bavarians, together with the Carantans, harassing them in continuous warfare finally defeated them. Those who took up their religion and accepted Christianity the kings made their tax-payers and by the tax payed to the king they are to the present day entitled to hold the land they inhabit."

The Annales Fuldenses are East Frankish chronicles that cover the period from the last years of Louis the Pious (died 840) to shortly after the end of effective Carolingian rule in East Francia with the accession of the child-king, Louis III, in 900. Throughout this period they are a near contemporary record of the events they describe and a primary source for Carolingian historiography.

Regino of Prüm (before 908) wrote the Avars lived in Pannonia when the Hungarians moved through their land, and the Hungarians were hostile only against the other nations but not with the Avars where the Hungarians were fishing and hunting. (because they were kinfolks)
Regino of Prüm - Wikipedia
"First they wandered in the wilderness of the Pannonians and Avars, obtaining their daily food by hunting and fishing. They then broke into the border areas of Carantans, Moravians and Bulgarians with repeated hostile attacks. A few people with swords and thousands destroyed with arrows..."

About the Hungarian campaign in the Duchy of Saxony from 906, Annalista Saxo writes that of the two raiding Hungarian armies one was Avar and the second Magyar (Hungarian).
"The Dalemnicians hired the Avars", against Henrik, the prince of Saxony; and these, after they made many massacres in Saxony, when they returned in Dalamantia, met face in face with the other army of the Magyars"

Godfrey of Viterbo (1120-1196) the clergy at the court of the Holy Roman Emperors, Conrad III and Frederick I Barbarossa, accompanying the latter on many of his campaigns, and frequently fulfilling for him diplomatic missions.
This was recorded by Godfrey of Viterbo at the year of 561-562:
"Avares, id est Ungari Pannonii" = "Avars, who are actually Hungarians in Pannonia"
"Avares, qui et Huni, sive Hungari" = "Avars, who are Huns, otherwise Hungarians"
Godfrey of Viterbo writes in the Pantheon:
Pantheon (book) - Wikipedia
"Regnum Scitarum et Avarum, id est Ungarorum priorum." = "The country of the Scythians and Avars, i.e. the former Hungarians."
After 300 years of rule and many wars, the Franks and Bulgarians destroyed the Avar state in the Carpathian Basin. The Franks/Bavarians occupied Pannonia and the Bulgarians occupied the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin. And when the Hungarians arrived in the Carpathian Basin, they found Avars (pre-Hungarians or different Hun or Hungarian tribe, as we can see many contemporary sources

identifies them), Szekelys (Huns) in Transylvania, Franks (Bavarians/Germans) on west, Slavs on the northwest (The 50 years long Great Moravia used this power vacuum) and Bulgarians (who also had Hun connection just later the Bulgarian language changed to Slavic, because on that territory the majority of the population were Slavic and they assimilated the Bulgarians). Where the majority were Slavic like Poland, Bohemia, Croatia... they founded Slavic states, but the majority in the Carpathian Basin was not Slavic that is why the Hungarians tribes did not assimilate.
Professor Gyula László's Avar-Hungarian continuity theory (He was historian, archeologist, teacher of the university)
His main work is the novel theory of "double conquest" of the Carpathian Basin by Hungarians in 5th and 9th century. The essence of the theory is that (Pannonian) Avar culture is similar, or sometimes identical to Hungarian culture, so the conquest in circa 895, confirmed by all historians, must have been essentially a second entrance that followed an earlier, broader, less well documented, Avar invasion.
Gyula László - Wikipedia
Gyula László suggests that late Avars, arriving to the khaganate in 670 in great numbers, lived through the time between the destruction and plunder of the Avar state by the Franks during 791–795 and the arrival of the Magyars in 895. László points out that the settlements of the Hungarians (Magyars) complemented, rather than replaced, those of the Avars. Avars remained on the plough fields, good for agriculture, while Hungarians took the river banks and river flats, suitable for pasturage. He also notes that while the Hungarian graveyards consist of 40–50 graves on average, those of the Avars contain 600–1000. According to these findings, the Avars not only survived the end of the Avar polity but lived in great masses and far outnumbered the Hungarian conquerors of Árpád. He also shows that Hungarians occupied only the centre of the Carpathian basin, but Avars lived in a larger territory. Looking at those territories where only the Avars lived, one only finds Hungarian geographical names, not Slavic or Turkic as would be expected interspersed among them. This is further evidence for the Avar-Hungarian continuity. Names of the Hungarian tribes, chieftains and the words used for the leaders, etc., suggest that at least the leaders of the Hungarian conquerors were Turkic speaking. However, Hungarian is not a Turkic language, and so they must have been assimilated by the Avars that outnumbered them and the genetics of today's modern Hungarians is no different than that of neighboring West Slavs as well as western Ukrainians. László's Avar-Hungarian continuity theory also states that the modern Hungarian language descends from that spoken by the Avars rather than the conquering Magyars. László's research does suggest, at the very least, that it is likely that any remaining Avars in the Carpathian Basin who resisted Slavic assimilation were absorbed by the invading Magyars and lost their identity.

This is the church in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia in Romanian). Gyula+fehér+vár = Gyula+white+castle, alba=white in Latin. The Latin name of the city was Apulum, but the allegedly "super ancient" Romanians forgot this Latin name and translated it from the Hungarian one.
The present Catholic cathedral was built in the 12th or 13th century.

Anglo-Saxon world map from 1025-1050
Early world maps - Wikipedia
This old map call the territory of the Hungarian Kingdom: "Hunorum gens" = "Hun race"
The Huns ruled the Carpathian Basin around 370-470, then after Attila, the Huns moved back to Scythia but according to the chronicles, the Szekelys are the remaining Huns in Transylvania. The Avars also ruled the full Carpathian Basin around 560-820 and many contemporary high-ranked authors write Avars = Huns. When the Avar state destroyed by the Franks and Bulgarians these authors mention that the Avar population remained. This Anglo-Saxon map calls "Land of the Hun race/clan/nation" the territory of the Hungarian Kingdom at the time of King Saint Stephen of Hungary after 600 years later of King Attila the Hun. This is a really long period, but they knew well at that time the Hungarians are the descendant of the Huns.
We cannot see any Vlachs or Romanians on this old map.
