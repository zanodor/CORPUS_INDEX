Introduction to t h e
Second E dition
IN THE IMAGINATION OF THE WEST, INDIA IS THE LAND
of magic and mystery, wisdom and religiosity, tra
dition and ritual. India has long held exotic appeal;
its arts, literature, music are distinct. But, at the
same time, there are aspects of Indic culture that
speak straight to the heart of the West, which should not surprise us
because India and the West have had a shared histoty going back
many thousands of years.
Sanskrit is the oldest of any of the Indo-European languages. The
ancient Vedic culture of India resembles the ancient European, par
ticularly the Celtic, which had similar orders of priests and bards. The
question of whether the Indic peoples and the Europeans shared the
same homeland in remote antiquity has been the grist o f ceaseless
speculation. Today many Indians are still connected to the glorious
past of their country, keeping alive an ancient stream of knowledge
and wisdom. We may ask: Is India also a doorway to the long-forgot
ten past of the West?
Columbus set out to find a new sea route to India and ended up
discovering America. Since then, the West and India have met in the
realm of the mind. Thus, in the last century, Mohandas Gandhi’s
ideas influenced the human rights movement. Most recently, Hindu
wisdom about Yoga, mind-body connection, and self-knowledge has
swept the Western hemisphere. It appears that, by understanding
the heart of India’s great civilization, we are nearing the time when
the quest of Columbus will be taken to its logical conclusion. Indic
spirituality, which goes back to a distant past in unbroken sequence,



xiv @ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
holds a special fascination for Westerners. It is a spirituality that is
universal and addresses the deepest questions of meaning and knowl
edge, and thus also speaks to humanity’s innermost concerns in the
present Age of Science.
The sages, philosophers, and mystics of India have held out a
shining vision that has inspired the world in many ways. Some 2300
years ago, Alexander the Great brought yogis back to Greece with
him, and Athens is said to have been visited by impressive gym no
sop h istes, naked wise men, from the Indian subcontinent. Indic ele
ments have been detected in early Greek art. The influence of East
ern, notably Indic, teachings was so pervasive in ancient Greece that
Diogenes Laertius (3rd century a .d .) felt it necessary to determine
whether Greek philosophy was of foreign origin or a product of na
tive efforts. What is more, he was only one in a long line of discus
sants. Pythagoras (6th century B.c.), an early luminary of Mediterra
nean philosophizing, is increasingly acknowledged to have been a
transmitter o f knowledge and wisdom received from the East. This
was already the view o f his younger contemporary Philostratus. Hel
lenism is precisely the product of indigenous Greek thought and East
ern influences. Neoplatonism, which rose out of Hellenism, domi
nated the European worldview between the second and sixth centu
ries a .d ., before the Christian scholastics ushered in an era of Aristo
telian dominance that lasted until the sixteenth century and paved
the way for modern science.
Long before the Greeks, however, we find Indic peoples in West
Asia in the second millennium b .c., in the Kassite kingdom of Babylon
and the Mitannis of Syria. The father of the famous Queen Nefertiti
of Egypt was the Mitanni king Tushratha. It is quite conceivable that
the religious traditions o f West Asia preserve a remembrance of their
Indic past.
Thus Indic thought transformed not only China and Southeast
Asia through the export o f Hindu and Buddhist teachings, but it also
provided key impulses to Western thought. In this connection, let us
also not forget that the modern mind was shaped after the West
adopted two powerful ideas, which are integral to the Indic civiliza
tion: the idea of living in harmony with nature and the idea that



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION * xv
reality has a scientific basis. In the past couple of centuries, these
ideas and other India-derived notions have inspired many great schol
ars, scientists, and literary figures: Hegel, Fichte, Schlegel, Goethe,
Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Shelley, Wordsworth, Carlyle, Thoreau,
Emerson, Tennyson, Yeats, A. E. Russell, Edwin Arnold, E. M. Forster,
Blavatsky, Romain Rolland, Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood,
C. F. von Weizsäcker, Robert Oppenheimer, David Bohm, and others.
Possibly the most remarkable intellectual achievement of the
twentieth century is quantum theory, which is at the basis of our
understanding of chemistry, biology, and physics and consequently
is at the basis of the astonishing technological advances witnessed
during the past century. One of the two creators of this theory was
Erwin Schrodinger. In an autobiographical essay, he explains that
his discovery of quantum mechanics was an attempt to give form to
the central notions of the nondualist philosophy of Vedanta. Thus,
in this indirect sense, India has played a role in the birthing of quan
tum theory as well.
Quantum mechanics has led to an effective understanding of the
world, leading to the creation of new machines and tools. Today hu
manity is facing the last frontier, namely the human mind. It is here
that Indic ideas will possibly prove even more valuable and decisive.
Clearly, there are a number of reasons why we should be inter
ested in India. Some relate to the origins o f science and religion,
others concern our yearning for knowledge o f self and humanity's
future destiny. The Indic culture area provides us with extensive
material, across a very broad time span, that can help us understand
the earliest history of ideas. The ancient Indic texts are layered in
such a fashion that we can see the gradual development of math
ematical, physical, linguistic, and psychological concepts. We find
that their authors were deeply interested in cognitive science, in which
they were so advanced that their insights may yet prove useful to
modern science.
The scholarly understanding of the chronological framework of
the Indic civilization has changed greatly in the last few years due to
truly revolutionary discoveries in archaeology. The main archaeo
logical periods are:



xvi @ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
Rock Art Period — 4 0 ,0 0 0 b.c. onwards to
historical times
Indus-Sarasvati lradition — 8 0 0 0 b.c. to 1300 B.C.
Early Harappan Period — 3 3 0 0 b.c. to 2 6 0 0 B.C.
Mature Harappan Period — 2 6 0 0 B.C. to 1900 B.C.
Late Harappan Period — 1900 B.C. to 1300 B.C.
Regionalization Period — 1300 B.C. to 800 B.C.
Northern Black Polished Ware — 8 0 0 B.C. to 5 0 0 B.C.
The earliest Indic art is preserved on rocks and dates from the
Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. The beginnings o f the
rock art have been traced back to the decorated ostrich eggshells
from Rajasthan, dated to around 40,000 b.c. by means of radiocar
bon techniques. Subsequent phases have been determined on the
basis o f stylistic considerations and comparative radiocarbon dates.
For the Mesolithic period ( 120 0 0 -6 0 0 0 B.c.), the rock sites are
found distributed all over the countty, although the most impressive
sites are to be found in Madhya Pradesh. The earliest drawings o f
this tradition are characterized by dynamic action, vitality in form,
and an acute insight into abstraction and visual perception.
A striking aspect o f the early rock art is its drawing of tessella
tions, which show infinite repetition. This repetition may occur spe
cific to a basic pattern or, more abstractly, the lines extend spatially
in such a manner that a basic pattern is repeated in two directions.
An understanding o f this abstract concept must have been a part of
the thought system o f these early artists. This motif can be seen as
being continuous with the central notion o f infinity in later Indic
thought. Also, a significant continuity o f motif between the rock art
and the art of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization (8000-1900 B.c.) has
been found, indicating an unbroken link between this great urban
culture and the Paleolithic and Mesolithic cultures of India.
According to the archaeological record, there is an unbroken tra
dition going back to about 8 0 0 0 B.c. The earliest textual source is the
Rig- Veda, which is a compilation of very ancient material. Astro
nomical references in this and other Vedic works recall events in the



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION @ xvii
third to fifth millennium B .c. and earlier. The recent geological dis
covery. that the Sarasvati, the preeminent river of Rig-Vedic times,
went dry around 1900 B.c. as a result of tectonic upheavals implies
that the Rig- Veda must be dated prior to this date. According to tra
dition, which scholars are finally beginning to take more seriously,
the Rig-V eda is the creation of a period preceding 3 1 0 0 B .c .
The Puranic genealogies start with mythical events, and the early
Saptarshi calendar begins with the year 6 6 7 6 B.c., which is under
stood to be the starting point of the royal genealogies; a later Saptar
shi calendar, still in use in different parts o f the India, begins with
3 0 7 6 B.c. Other old calendars are Kaliyuga (3102 B.c.), Vikrama (58
B.c.), and Shaka (78 A.o.). The Bharata War marks an epochal crisis
in ancient Indic society. Later astronomers assigned it to 3 1 3 7 B.c.,
2 4 4 9 B.c., or 1924 B .c . The main actors of this War belong to genera
tion number 94 in a list that is supposed to commence with 6 6 7 6 B.c.
If a generation is reckoned as spanning 2 5 years, we arrive at 3 3 2 6
B.c. Underwater archaeology has found evidence of a submerged city
identified as Dvaraka, the hometown of Krishna, one o f the main
actors in the Bharata War. The city has been dated back to about
1500 B.c., thus offering yet another date for the war. In any case,
native Indic historical traditions, which once seemed fantastic, have
become more plausible, and Western scholars are beginning to re
vise their historical reconstructions.
Since the first edition of the present book, considerable new evi
dence has come in that further supports our original conclusions.
Scholars now trace the antecedents of writing in India to 3 3 0 0 B.c.,
that is, as early as in Sumer and Egypt. Significant new sites relating
to Indian antiquity have been discovered, such as the great city of
Dholavira in Gujarat, one of the largest ports in the ancient world.
Excavation has started in Rakhigarhi west of Delhi, a city that was
considerably larger than Mohenjodaro and Harappa and at least as
old. Ancient sites have recently been found in the east of India as far
as Lucknow. Geologists in India have done numerous studies verify
ing the course of the Sarasvati River and the civilization along it and
have produced an entire tome on it. New biological evidence sug
gests that the Indian population has lived in the peninsula for at



least 50 ,0 0 0 years. The analysis of the genetic evidence suggests
that the splitting up of the Indic and the European people took place
as long as 9 0 0 0 years ago. Meanwhile no solid evidence of any mi
gration, much less invasion o f populations from Central Asia into
India, has yet to be found.
India has emerged as the oldest continuous civilization on Earth,
which continues to fertilize the West with its profound spirituality.
Today an estimated 2 0 million Americans are practicing Yoga. Even
though most o f them are interested in Yoga only as a system o f health
and fitness, they are indirectly exposed also to its deeper aspects.
The old adage ex orien te lux still applies.

PREFACE
THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT HISTORY— NOT T H E KIND OF
dull chronology of dynasties and battles to which
we were exposed in our school days but m eaning
J u l history that is deeply relevant to our lives today.
It is about the human spirit struggling for self-ex
pression and self-understanding, which is a struggle that continues
to this day, perhaps more so than ever.
We live in an age of unprecedented challenges and opportuni
ties. On the one hand, we face the grim reality of overpopulation,
hunger, ecological disasters, and new devastating diseases, as well
as the ever-present possibility o f a nuclear holocaust. On the other
hand, science constantly expands our intellectual horizon and helps
create new technological wonders that, we hope, will solve some of
our problems. Biologists are “engineering" genes to increase the pro
ductivity o f vegetables and fruit trees; chemists are unlocking en
zymes to make them usable for nonbiological purposes, such as waste
disposal, or to repair DNA in order to enhance and prolong life; and
physicists are working on superconductivity and the use o f lasers in
computers. Scientists are also exploring the possibility o f bionic or
gans, the application of electromagnetic fields in the healing process,
and artificial intelligence. The list could easily be extended to fill the
remaining pages o f this book.
Every day science adds a profusion of knowledge to our data
banks. Yet only a fraction of this knowledge finds its way into our
brains, and only a small proportion o f that fraction is truly assim i
lated by us. Indeed, the knowledge explosion is one of the problems
we are facing. Like any explosion, it leaves us with fragments. Even



IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
specialists are no longer able to keep abreast o f the developments in
their own discipline. They know less and less about more and more.
With around 7,000 scientific papers written every day in the English
language alone, how could any one person be expected to follow,
never mind catch up with, the ever-receding horizon o f scientific ex
ploration?
The lay public is even less able to keep up with, or make sense
of, scientific knowledge. There is a significant time lag of approxi
mately twenty-five years between a scientific discovery and its as
similation by the public at large. In other words, what scientists are
investigating today will not be common knowledge until our chil
dren are young adults and perhaps have children o f their own. Our
school books are outdated, and even university textbooks tend to
reflect only "well-established" knowledge. Facts and hypotheses that
do not readily fit into the current way o f thinking—the reigning para
digm—are generally ignored, if not suppressed. When it comes to pet
theories and cherished opinions, scientists are as human as anyone
else. This is true whether we are considering physics, chemistry, as
tronomy, archaeology, or historiography (th e description of history).
The alarming truth is that we have no firm grasp on what all the
information produced by science means. We are unable to under
stand the interconnection between the amassed facts and figures.
Our so-called Information Age is rich in data but sadly lacking in
understanding. Generalists—scientists or scholars who attempt to
see the larger picture— are few and far between, because they are
generally not encouraged by the academic establishment. Hence we
are left with bits and pieces that seldom fit together, giving rise to
anxiety rather than understanding.
And yet, in order to live meaningful and happy lives, we must be
whole not only in our bodies but also in our hearts and minds. This
means we must have a viable vision to live by. Yet science, which for
many people has replaced religion and to which all o f us to one de
gree or another look for guidance, offers us no overarching synthesis
of knowledge. Therefore, our modern civilization as a whole is com
parable to a rudderless ship. We have no shared vision, and, as the
biblical proverb says, “Where there is no vision, the people perish."



PREFACE
As many clear-sighted observers of the human drama have noted,
our era is short in vision and wisdom. It is therefore not surprising
that many of us are wondering about bygone ages and past civiliza
tions. How did they meet life’s challenges? How did they view Na
ture? What trials and tribulations shaped their experience of the
world? How did they meet the great natural catastrophes— earth
quakes and volcanic eruptions—that we know afflicted humankind
throughout its civilized history? How did they use their knowledge?
Did they have true wisdom? For what reasons did civilizations like
Sumer, Babylonia, Assyria, Dilmun, Elam and, not least, pharaonic
Egypt become extinct? What errors of judgment did our distant an
cestors commit? How did they fail to adapt successfully to the chang
ing conditions in the world? To be sure, many ancient cultures looked
nostalgically back at a Golden Age when peace and harmony reigned
in the world, while their own times were frequently marked by politi
cal turbulence and cultural upheaval. Was there such a Golden Age?
Has any of its wisdom survived? How has the torch of human under
standing been passed from one age to the next? What has been lost
in the process o f spanning millennia? Can we learn any lessons from
the thin strands of tradition that withstood the attrition of time?
Questions like these, which concern the value of what may have
been lost, are not asked by mainstream historians because, like their
colleagues in physics or chemistry, they chase the mirage of a value
free science. In real life, however, facts and values are inextricably
interlinked. By ignoring this circumstance, scientists merely squeeze
the lifeblood out of reality, making it into an abstraction that cannot
give us meaningful guidance.
In this book we are trying to answer some of these questions in
regard to a civilization that has a very special place in the story of
human cultural evolution and that nonetheless is barely known. Ever
since Napoleon’s days, we in the West have been dazzled by the
splendor ofpharaonic Egypt—with its impressive pyramids, the mys
terious Sphinx, and the magnificent treasures o f Tutankhamen. We
also have been impressed with the intellectual achievements of the
learned elite of Sumer, which, according to our schoolbooks, was
responsible for the invention of writing, the potter’s wheel, wheeled
^ xxi



carts, cylinder seals, cosmology, formal law, and bicameral political
congress.
Most o f the “first time ever" claims made for the Sumerians have
in recent years been exposed as exaggerated or absurd. There is
mounting evidence that neither Sumer nor Egypt quite deserve the
pride of place among the ancient civilizations. Rather the cradle of
civilization appears to lie beyond the fertile valleys o f the Nile, Tigris,
and Euphrates Rivers. We invite the reader to join us in a journey of
discovery, which in its implications, seems far more thrilling to us
than the discoveries ofTroy, the Elamite civilization in Iran, the “lost"
civilization of Dilmun on the island of Bahrain in the Arabian/Per
sian Gulf or, most recently, the discovery of what may have been the
kingdom of Sheba in the extreme south o f the Arabian peninsula.
As we will show, India is the giant that looms behind these early
urban cultures. This astonishing finding completely revolutionizes
our understanding o f ancient history. It challenges us anew to look
for the cradle of human civilization. We do not claim to have solved
the riddle of the Big Bang of our civilized universe, merely that we
are possibly closer to it than ever before. In this book we introduce
exciting new evidence that sheds light on a hitherto obscure phase of
ancient history. We believe the recent findings are significantly nar
rowing the gap between the early Neolithic civilizations and the end
o f the Ice Age and its Paleolithic cultures.
This is the first time that these amazing developments in archae
ology and history are reviewed in a comprehensive and comprehen
sible fashion. Why has it taken so long to recognize the significance
of ancient India in the saga of human civilization? In his book L ook
in gJorD ilm u n , Geoffrey Bibby rightly remarked that the “Indus Val
ley civilization is the Cinderella of the ancient world."1Indeed, for a
variety of reasons, ancient India has been sorely neglected by ar
chaeologists and historians. Prevailing misconceptions and biases
have long hampered the study of ancient India's civilization. Fortu
nately this regrettable situation is beginning to change, and the new
attitude in scholarly circles has already proven enormously produc
tive. Quite likely, the recent successes in reinterpreting ancient India's
civilization will further speed up this promising process o f revisioning

ancient history that a handful of daring historians and archaeolo
gists have begun.
As we have indicated, we believe that all this is not merely o f
theoretical interest. Our understanding of history can prove crucial

can learn only one lesson from history: that humanity so far has
learned nothing from it. Sadly enough, there is some substance to
this claim. But this pessimistic view does not penetrate deep enough.
For we must not overlook the fact that it is precisely our awareness
of the past, especially our errors, that has guaranteed humanity's
continued existence to date. Our species would have become extinct
long ago if we had not learned anything at all from our mistakes.
We know that entire civilizations have perished, but there al
ways have been survivors to tell the story and to resume the human
experiment. But this time around we are facing the unbelievable
danger of there not being a single survivor on this planet. Unlike
past civilizations, which were relatively local societies, our own civi
lization has spread itself across the entire planet. The ecological im
balance triggered by our unwise way o f life affects not only one
region or continent, but every living organism on Earth. A nuclear
holocaust or global ecological catastrophe could bring modern civili
zation perilously close to extinction. This makes it all the more press
ing to understand our species' past and benefit from the experience

and hard-won knowledge o f our ancestors. While the present-day
challenge is unique in its magnitude, it involves fundamental mat
ters of living—particularly in the moral and spiritual realm—that
may well have been better understood by earlier civilizations and
cultures.
Clearly we moderns are in a quandary. We have effectively de
parted from the old ways but have not yet created viable new forms
of meaning. Many of us feel utterly lost and confused. Western civi
lization, whose tentacles reach around the globe, is transitional. The
transition is radical and decisive. Another word for our situation is
crisis. We are in the throes of a deep crisis that, when we go to the
root of our problems, is a crisis of consciousness. We are facing the
considerable challenge of having to evolve into planetary citizens—a
challenge that calls for conscious choice and commitment. We would
do well to ponder the wisdom of the ancients, who had to pass through
their own crises and formulate their own answers to the problems of
existence. We must not expect that all their answers or solutions will
apply to our present-day situation. However, we can expect that some
of our ancestors’ more important answers—their wisdom distilled in
the crucible of life—will have a bearing on our own dilemma.
Ancient India, we feel, has much to teach us.

R evisioning the Past, Envisioning
the Future
Lifting the Veil of the Past
WHAT W E CALL HISTORY IS A PALE RECONSTRUCTION
of the actual events of the past. We make models
of what we think happened, and frequently we
confuse our models with reality. The fact is that
our models, particularly those concerning the re
mote past, are no more accurate than a papier-mâché model o f a jet
engine. We have the rough outlines but lack insight into the essen
tials. This statement becomes truer the farther back we go in time.
The trouble is that the less we really know, the more we want
certainty, and so historians have been busily constructing their own
versions of history. Since most historians are employed by academic
institutions, they must ensure that their particular version does not
stray too far from the accepted norm, lest they find themselves un
der attack or out o f a job. Often this felt need to safeguard their
reputation obliges professional historians and archaeologists to ig
nore evidence and offhandedly dismiss theories that do not fit readily
into the prevailing framework o f explanations. Existing paradigms
are generally rocked only when this ill-fitting evidence becomes so
mountainous that it can no longer be swept under the carpet of
complacency.
In his widely acclaimed book The Structure oqfScienttfic R evolu
tions, philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn has described some o f the ways



in which reigning scientific paradigms collapse and make room for
new paradigms, seldom without fierce struggle within the scientific
community. 1A paradigm shift, as Kuhn recognized, demands a shift
of vision. This amounts to a cognitive revolution that radically alters
one’s point o f view. This is seldom an easy task because scientists,
like anyone else, have a lot at stake in adopting or abandoning a
particular point of view.
To lift the veil of the past, we must first lift the veil o f our own
minds. Our preconceptions tend to cloud our perceptions. We can see
clearly only when we are willing to suspend our judgment and, as
much as humanly possible, allow the evidence to speak for itself.
Above all, we must be prepared to reexamine our theories when we
encounter a sufficient number of anomalous or ill-fitting facts.
The Lesson of the Sphinx
We believe that the anomalous evidence for ancient India has
reached such a critical mass and that we are on the threshold of a
new understanding of the early Indic civilization. Significantly enough,
the new understanding chronicled in the present book is paralleled
by similar revisions in the study o f other Neolithic civilizations, no
tably the Egyptian and the Mayan, which can serve as useful com
parisons.
In his widely read book Serpent in th e S ky, John Anthony West
seriously challenges Egyptologists when he invokes a single, if ex
traordinary, piece o f geological evidence to call into question the con
ventional date for the Sphinx. 2This mysterious sculpture, carved out
ofliving rock, has long fascinated and puzzled pilgrims and travelers
to Egypt and numerous others who have seen it captured in draw
ings, paintings, photographs, or films.
In his influential memoirs entitled D escription efE g y p t, Benoît
de Maillet, who was the French consul-general in Egypt under Louis
XIV, described the Sphinx as “a woman's head grafted on to a lion’s
body. ”3 He speculated that it might represent a three-dimensional
combination o f the astrological signs of Virgo and Leo. Since astrol
ogy/astronomy was one of the most important crafts or sciences of
4 * IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



REVISIONING THE PAST, ENVISIONING THE FUTURE @ 5
antiquity and is among the oldest intellectual preoccupations, his
speculation m ay not be too far off the mark.
However, the face of the Sphinx is so badly mutilated that it is
difficult to tell whether it represents a
woman or a man. The archaeological
establishment considers the Sphinx to
be a likeness of its creator, or spon
sor, the fou rth-d yn asty pharaoh
Chephren (Khaufre). He is thought to
have lived around 2 7 0 0 B .c . and is
also held responsible for the building
of the second pyramid at Giza.
Today the Sphinx is severely dam
aged from weather and the barbaric
habit of the eighteenth-century Mame
lukes of using this time-honored work
of art as an artillery target. Neverthe
less, standing sixty-six feet tall, the
Sphinx—half human, half lion—still
commands our respect and admira
tion, and we can only guess at the awe
pious pilgrims of bygone ages must
have felt in front of this towering sa
cred image.
West got the clue for his book on
the Sphinx from the Alsatian scholar
R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, whose symbological or “symbolist” stud
ies we will have occasion to mention shortly. He w as the first to
notice that the erosion damage on the body of the Sphinx was due
not to the action of wind and sand, as commonly believed, but to
water. The difficulty surrounding this finding is that the last severe
flooding of the Giza Plateau is thought to have s carred around 10,000
B .c. when the huge Sahara Desert was still fertile land.
In 1991, a small team consisting o f three geologists, a geophysi
cist, and an oceanographer organized by W est studied this problem
on location. The investigators concluded that the erosion damage to
Fig. 1. 'The Sphinx’s timeless gaze is in the direction e f the rising sun.



the Sphinx was indeed from water, but from precipitation and run
ning water rather than from a huge flood. The geological report fa
vors a construction date for the Sphinx between 5 0 0 0 B .c. and 7000
B .c . West, however, has continued to champion an earlier date, con
necting the damage to the Sphinx with the melting of the glaciers at
the end of the last Ice Age. Even the more conservative date of 5000
B .c . makes the Sphinx over two thousand years older than main
stream archaeology assumes.
We must note here that there are considerable problems with
pharaonic chronology in general. The dates given by Egyptologists
for Menes, who unified the upper and the lower kingdoms and
thereby inaugurated the first dynasty, range from 5 8 6 7 B .c. (Jean F.
Champollion, who deciphered the famous Rosetta Stone) to 2224
B.c. (Edward H. Palmer)— a difference o f 2 ,5 0 0 years. Sir Flinders
Petrie, who almost single-handedly invented Egyptology, pro
posed 5 5 4 6 B .c . a s the date o f Egypt’s political unification. The well
known Egyptologist James Henry Breasted placed Menes at around
3 4 0 0 B .c .. whereas the consensus of recent scholarly opinion fa
vors 2 9 0 0 B .c.
The chronology of predynastic Egypt is similarly bedeviled with
difficulties. It is now generally thought to extend from around 5000
B .c . to 3 0 0 0 B .c . As the British archaeologist Michael Rice has shown
in his fine book E gypt’s M aking, the predynastic Egyptians may have
had contact with, and even have been greatly inspired by, the
Sumerians.4There certainly are many fascinating similarities in sym
bolism and artistic expression between these two peoples. However,
this is an area still awaiting thorough exploration. The question of
who built the Sphinx remains unanswered, as does the related ques
tion of what it symbolizes.
In seeking to refute current archaeological thinking about the
Sphinx, West relies on a single geological feature. Understandably,
most Egyptologists have been less than accepting of his redating of
this monument, hoping that some other explanation can be ■found
for the strange marks of erosion.
By contrast, in our own case, we are not dealing with merely a
single piece of evidence; rather the facts have been piling up to such
6 @ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



an extent that the old theory about ancient India has simply col
lapsed. The only problem is that few scholars are aware of all the
new evidence. We hope that our book—though written for a nonspe
cialist audience—will fall into their hands as well and entice them to
look at the available evidence anew. So often Indologists (specialists
on India’s culture) simply reiterate the consensus understanding,
without themselves checking the primary material or at least sec
ondary sources. Paul W. Lapp, who is an archaeologist and Old Tes
tament specialist, made these pertinent comments about historical
sources:
The dreary days q fplodding are punctuated by new discov
eries, .fresh insights. The sou rces prove tn te to their nam e.
They are sou rces q f new ideas; w ithout them the p a s t w ould
b e lo st an d a depth dim ension oqfllf-e m issing. They m ay seem an arid d esert,an d the historian is qften w earied by thejou r
ney. At th e end is an oasis, a spring, a so u rce-refresh m en t
f o r the human spirit a s it pressesfo rw a rd on the endless
path tow ard self-understanding."
Lapp further remarked that in addition to primary and secondary
sources, there is a third essential source in the creation o f history,
which is the historian himself or herself. He or she must have a
fertile mind and the ability for disciplined and lucid thinking (and
writing). More than that, however, the historian must be willing to
live with ambiguity and mystery, for the past can never be completely
known. Therefore, we must approach it not only with a high mea
sure of openness (to take in as much as we can) but also an equal
measure of modesty and self-honesty (to accept that our understand
ing is bound to remain incomplete and subject to correction in the
future). In practice, historians tend to present their historical recon
structions as final solutions. As Lapp observed:
This b e lie fq fth e historian th at h e can construct a h istorical

doxical or the absurd.6
But the historian’s task is an activity, as Lapp rightly pointed

out, by which we enhance our own humanity, for writing history
asserts our faith in ourselves and in the meaningfulness of our ex
istence. In reading history, we affirm the same faith.
A L esso n from M esoam erica
To give another example of recent efforts at revisioning ancient
history, we can refer to the enigmatic Maya civilization. But first some
background. Orthodox theory has it that the New World was first
populated toward the end o f the Ice Age, when roving bands of Asi
atic peoples crossed over the Bering Straits land bridge, which now
is under 140 feet of water. These nomads then spread fairly rapidly
across North America and, by around 9000 B.c., had reached the
windswept southern tip of South America.
This official version of history, which is still repeated in many
publications, has in recent decades been challenged by a number of
important archaeological finds that show the presence of early hu
manity in the New World long before the melting of the glaciers around
1 0 .000 b .c . Migrants from Asia could have arrived 3 0 ,0 0 0 and even
4 0 .0 0 0 years ago, when sea levels also were low enough to free up
the narrow strip of land that connects North America to Siberia. Some
researchers, including the world-renowned paleontologist Louis
Leakey, believe they have found traces of a much earlier occupation,
though the evidence is considered highly controversial. At any rate,
archaeological dates have been systematically pushed back in recent
years for a variety of cultures.
This also applies to the people known as the Maya, who occu
pied— and still occupy—the large area o f what are now Mexico, Hon
duras, Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Not too long ago the Maya
were thought to have emerged from sheer barbarism as late as the
first or second century a.d. Then the Olmec civilization, best known
for its creation o f colossal basalt heads six to nine feet high in the
Mexican states of Tabasco and Veracruz at the Gulf of Mexico, was
discovered. As Jacques Soustelle, a professor of anthropology, pre
history, and ethnology at the prestigious French Centre National du
Recherche Scientifique, wrote:

The beginnings of the Olmec civi
lization, which belongs to the Mayan
world, have been dated back to at least
1500 B.c. Today, archaeologists very
confidently affirm the presence o f hu
man beings in Mesoamerica b y at least
2 0 ,0 0 0 B.c.. and they also assign the
beginnings of Mayan culture to the
third millennium B .c .. The earliest
Maya tribes, who made pottery and
cultivated maize, are thought to have
arrived in the highlands o f Guatemala
around 2500 b .c though it is not
known from where. During the clas
sical period (now reckoned between 2 0 0 a .d . and 9 0 0 a .d .) , the Maya
became the only other civilization apart from the Egyptians to con
struct true pyramids.
Speculations about the origin and reason for these temple pyra
mids abound. Particularly the so-called Sun and Moon pyramids of
Teotihuacan near Mexico City have stirred the imagination o f profes
sionals and would-be professionals alike. A readable historical re

view of the more controversial speculations and historical reconstruc
tions was provided by Peter Tompkins in his popular book M ysteries
q ft h e M exican JY ram ids.8 Specialists are slowly beginning to take a
new look at some of the evidence that has been discarded or sup
pressed by mainstream archaeology and Mayan studies.
T h e R ecovery o f Sym bolism
It appears that both paleontology and archaeology are consis
tently pushing back their chronologies, revealing earlier and earlier
beginnings for specific cultural features or whole civilizations. There
is also a slow but significant change in the way we think about our
ancestors. We are beginning to appreciate that they were no mere
primitives but had a sophisticated understanding of the world that,
in some respects, exceeds our own. In particular, their knowledge of
the symbolic (analogical rather than logical) connection between
things— including both mathematics and astronomy/astrology—was
superior to our own. As we are gradually discovering, such knowl
edge is important to our survival, because it discloses to us the deeper
harmony of existence, the geometry of the sacred. Without it, we are
spiritually and morally adrift.
In suggesting water as the cause of the Sphinx's worst erosion,
De Lubicz demonstrated acute perception, which effectively corrected
two hundred years of scholarly myopia. De Lubicz's overwhelming
originality emanates from every page o f his monumental work Le
Temple d e l'Homme, which was first published in 1957. He showed,
among other things, that the striking asymmetry of the Temple of
Luxor in Upper Egypt encodes the ancient Egyptians' notion of the
Cosmic Man, the Macranthropos. It contains significant symbolic ra
tios, which include the fundamental mathematical coefficients p i (the
ratio o f a circle to its diameter) and p h i (the Golden Section, the ratio
1 .61 80339. . . , arrived at by dividing a line in such a way that the
smaller portion is to the larger as the larger is to the whole).
The Temple of Luxor was erected during the New Kingdom, more
specifically the eighteenth dynasty, comprising fourteen pharaohs,
including Tutankhamen. However, the symbolic knowledge encap
10 * IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



sulated in the temple’s design is unquestionably much older. “In
Egypt," writes West, “symbolism was a precise science." H ealso noted
that symbolism was “perhaps the single most pervasive and striking
feature of its civilisation. ’,q What holds true o f Egypt also holds true
of the other ancient civilizations, including India.
Symbological research on ancient civilizations, which were very
sensitive to the correspondences between “above" (divine order) and
“below" (human order), has found adherents in disciplines other
than Egyptology. In her work The Hindu Temple, published in 1946,
the renowned American scholar Stella Kramrisch explored the sym
bolic dimension o f temple building in India. 10 She too found a strong
correlation between architectural proportions, mathematics, and cos
mology.
In the field of Mayan studies, the ground-breaking works of Linda
Schele, David Freidel. Joy Parker, and Mary Ellen Miller are particu
larly characteristic of the new approach. ' 1These and other studies
bear witness to the ingenuity of the ancients and their passion for
preserving the sacred order in their cultural creations. Whether we
are probing into the civilization o f the Maya, the Egyptians, the
Sumerians, the Chinese, or the Indians, we encounter a worldview
and ethos that is suffused with a deep symbolism in which Heaven
and Earth are connected through multiple correlations.
In this book, we will focus on the symbolic dimension of the
Indic civilization, with occasional side glances at the other great civi
lizations of antiquity. Our principal sources will be o f two kinds, ar
chaeological and literary. Each source sheds its own light on the past,
throwing into relief different features. We need both sources to ob
tain a fuller view and understanding.
India has no imposing pyramids, no mysterious Sphinx, no mas
sive four-thousand-year-old stone temples, and no prolific inscrip
tions on temple walls complete with colorful illustrations. Its arti
facts may be less spectacular than those of Egypt or the Maya king
doms, but they are no less important. Moreover, its potential for yield
ing many more significant artifacts is great. For, as we will show,
archaeologists have dug perhaps not in the wrong places but outside
the heartland o f the ancient Indic civilization. We cannot know what
REVISIONING THE PAST, ENVISIONING THE F UTURE * 11



treasures lie buried beneath the numerous mounds o f the vast Thar
Desert until archaeologists start to dig there.
What is certain is that the Indic civilization is incredibly com
plex, while our historical models are necessarily simple, if not sim
plistic. As the great British historian Arnold Toynbee observed, “In
dia is a whole world in herself: she is a society of the same magni
tude as our Western society.”12We must begin to appreciate this fact.
What is more, India antedates European (or Western) civilization by
thousands o f years and is in fact the oldest known continuous civili
zation on Earth. Pharaonic Egypt and Sumer are long gone, and the
modern Maya know almost nothing about their ancient heritage,
having been forcibly converted to Christianity by the Spaniards in
the sixteenth century. Even China, once praised as the oldest civili
zation on Earth, started little before 2 5 0 0 B.c.
In our quest for the cradle of civilization, we must properly grasp
India's place in the scheme o f things. This is the challenge tackled by
this book.

The Vedas: P y ra m id s Q fth e S p irit
The Buried T reasure of th e Sacred C anon o f th e H indus
IN TH E PREVIOUS CHAPTER, W E INTRODUCED TH E IDEA
of h istorical sources and indicated that in our pre
sentation we would be resorting to both archaeo
logical and literary sources. We begin with the lat
ter because they were the first to strike Western
scholars in their endeavor to understand the Indic civilization. Ever
since the British Raj, India's past has preoccupie d a small group of
specialists eager to trace modern Hinduism— the main cultural tradi
tion of India—back to its roots.
The beginnings of Indology—the study of India 's culture— are
rather prosaic. In order to govern their Hindu subjects s uccessfully,
the British overlords were eager to become acquainted with the in
digenous worldview and so they encouraged the study o f Sanskrit
and Sanskrit literature. As Sir Monier Monier-Williams, one o f the
pioneers of Indological research, put it toward the end o f the nine
teenth century:
To kn ow th e Hindus, to understand their p a st a n d presen t
condition, to reach their very h eart an d soul, we m ust study
Sanskrit literature. It is, in truth, even m ore to In dia than
classical an d patristic literature w as to Europe a t the tim e o f
th e Reform ation, ft g iv es a deeper im press to the Hindu mind,



s o th at every Hindu, how ever unlettered, is unconsciously
e fe c te d by it. 1
Sanskrit was and still is the lingua franca of the educated priestly
elite, the brahmins, and the great sacred scriptures of Hinduism are
written in this ancient language. The very first Sanskrit text to be trans
lated into E n glish -in 1785— was the B hagavad-G ita (“Lord's Song"),
which has been compared to the New Testament. Although it does not
officially belong to the sacred canon o f Hinduism, this scripture is held
in high esteem and is widely regarded as an honorary member o f the
sacred corpus.2 It is a didactic poem in which the God-man Krishna
instructs his royal disciple Prince Arjuna in spiritual matters on the
eve o f the greatest war fought on Indian soil in antiquity.
Scholars recognized right away that this immensely popular work,
which is frequently cited and recited by brahmins and educated Hin
dus, belongs to an early phase in the evolution o f Hinduism. Signifi
cantly, the B hagavad-G ita itself refers back to a still more ancient
period, which produced the source scriptures o f the sacred canon,
the four Vedic hymnodies. Scholars were understandably eager to
procure a copy of this canonical quartet. However, for a period the
brahmin custodians of the sacred Sanskrit literature refused to share
the four Vedas with inquisitive Western researchers. When they fi
nally did, it turned out that, although they could faultlessly recite the
Vedic hymns, they were rather ignorant of the meaning of the thou
sands o f verses flowing smoothly from their tongues. In fact, it was
Western scholarship in partnership with India’s pundits that opened
up the Vedas not only for Westerners but for the Indians themselves.
Today Vedic research is an important, if still curiously neglected
branch, of Indology.
Being the fountainhead of Hinduism and Indian culture in gen
eral, the four Vedas are, as can be expected, of the utmost impor
tance to historians. Yet, surprisingly, their significance as historical
documents has generally been underplayed.3 Scholars have chosen
to see in them literary creations of little more than mythological and
theological relevance. This attitude parallels the attitude displayed
toward the Bible prior to the revolutionary archaeological discover

ies in the Middle East during the latter part of the nineteenth century.
Excavations in Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Egypt gave substance
to many o f the people, places, and events chronicled in the Bible that
had until then been dismissed as merely legendary. As the German
writer Werner Keller noted in T he B ible As H istory, which has sold
more than ten million copies and been translated into twenty-four
languages:
Qften th e results efin v estig ation correspon d in d etail with
the B iblical narratives. They do not only co'lfirm them , but
also illum ine th e historical situ ation s ou t e f w hich th e Old
Testament an d th e G ospels grew . 4
While not everything in the biblical narratives has been confirmed
by archaeology, the correlation between scriptural testimony and ar
tifactual evidence has been astounding. Today biblical archaeology
is a scientific discipline in its own right, continuing to shed light on
the Bible as a historical document.
Unlike the Bible, the Vedas are poor in the kind o f information
that could be translated into a historical context, such as the migra
tion o f tribes, succession of rulers, or wars. Their wealth lies in the
domain o f theology and mythology. In this respect, the Vedas are
similar to the Homeric epics, which nevertheless led Heinrich
Schliemann to the discovery of Agamemnon's Troy. The Vedas are
likewise not entirely mute when it comes to historically relevant data.
We will show in later chapters how the names of rivers, geographical
descriptions, and especially astronomical information in the Vedic
hymns contain very important clues for historians. Clearly, behind
the sacred utterances of the Vedas was a real world. The reluctance
among scholars to make proper use of the Vedas, in our view, is
connected with a prevailing prejudice that regards these texts as
unhistorical sacred tradition.
In the face o f the archaeological surprises during the past 150
years or so, which have brought to light the worlds behind such
great literary creations as the Bible, the Iliad and the Odyssey, as
well as the Arthurian legends and the Popol Vuh (“Communal Book")
o f the Quiché Maya of Guatemala, we should not be too pessimistic

about the historical basis and value of the Vedas either. On the con
trary, the information in the Vedas allows us to make sense of some
of the archaeological spadework already done in northern India, pro
viding we place it in its proper perspective.
Before delving into the controversial question of the age of the
Vedas, we will furnish a rough outline of the sacred literature of Hin
duism. This will provide the reader with useful basic definitions on
which the rest of our discussion is built.
T h e F o u r V ed as: T h e T ran sm issio n o f H eard W isdom
The Sanskrit word veda means literally “knowledge’’ or “wis
dom.” The term is applied to the four ancient collections o f hymns
the R ig -Veda, Yqjur-Veda, S a m a-Veda, and A tharva-V eda. These
hymnodies, about which we
will say more shortly, are
deemed to be records of re
vealed wisdom. They are in fact
the largest body of sacred lit
erature surviving from the an
cient world. For literally thou
sands of years they have been
passed down faithfully by spe
cial families within the brah
min communities of India.
The transmission of this
sacred knowledge appears to
have been primarily by word of
mouth, usually from father to
son, generation after genera
tion. The Vedic lore, thought of
as divine revelation, was kept
in such high regard that every
word was painstakingly mem
orized. Even when the original meaning of many o f the words had
been lost, the brahmins vigorously adhered to the ideal o f remem
FIG. 3. South Indian priest peifoom in g a f i re ceremony (puja).



THE VEDAS: P YRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 17
bering and reciting the hymns with utmost fidelity. After the passage
of several thousand years, only one uncertain reading of a single
word can be found in the entire R ig- Veda (Vll.44.3), the oldest of the
four Vedic hymnodies.
The brahmins ascribed special potency to the vety sound of the
Vedic utterances. They regarded the Vedas as a manifestation o f the
eternal Sound or what the Gnostics much later called the logos. The
brahmins felt a special responsibility for representing this epiphany
of the divine Reality as faithfully as possible. One scholar even sug
gested that perhaps because the Rig-V eda “was so imperfectly un
derstood [this] helped to preserve the purity o f its transmission. " 5
While it is by no means certain that the Vedas were not written
down early on, as most Indologists assume, the emphasis was clearly
on accurate oral transmission. The Vedic knowledge was considered
so precious that no perishable writing materials—birch bark and palm
leaves—could be solely trusted for its preservation. Paper does not
appear to have been introduced into India until the Muslims made
their political presence felt in the period after 1000 a .d.
There can be little question that the Vedas are the most impres
sive literary achievement of antiquity. In extent, they far surpass the
Bible, and they dwarf Homer's epics as they do the sacred canon of
the ancient Chinese civilization. The four Vedas consist of 20,358
verses, amounting to approximately two thousand printed pages.
These served as the foundation for the later revealed literature com
prising the B rahm an as (ritual texts), the A ran yakas (ritual and
meditational texts for forest-dwelling ascetics), and the U panishads
(esoteric texts). This derivative literature within the category of re
vealed knowledge, or shru ti (“what is heard"), is vast and diversi
fied. The U panishads alone comprise over two hundred separate
works, though a traditional figure of 108 is frequently mentioned:
The numeral 108 suggests sacred completeness or wholeness.
In addition, there are the numerous works belonging to the cat
egory o f remembered or traditional knowledge, or what is called smritr.
This secondary literature includes Sutras (telegram-style explana
tory treatises) dealing with ritual, law, and morality, as well as India’s
two great epics—the M ahabharata and the R a m a y a n a -a n d dozens



of Puranas (sacred encyclopedia-type histories). The M ahabharata
itself runs to around 100,000 stanzas, and thus is probably the longest
book in the world. The nucleus of this gargantuan epic goes back to
around 1500 B.c. or perhaps even 3 1 0 0 B.c., both of which have
been suggested as possible dates for the great civil war of the Bharata
nation. However, the religious and moral teachings of the
M ahabharata are unthinkable without the much older Vedic revela
tion. All these scriptures contain scores of ideas and practices de
rived directly from the four Vedas, which are acknowledged as the
sacred fountainhead of Hinduism.
Thus, in the realm of the human spirit, the Vedas are like the
pyramids that still tower enigmatically above us—a lasting tribute to
the ingenuity and lofty aspiration of the ancients. Through the cen
turies, India's mystics and sages have held the Vedas in great ven
eration, if not awe. This alone should cause us to look at this body of
work with high expectation.
In modification o f Sir Monier-Williams's statement quoted above,
we could say that in order to understand India, we must study espe
cially the archaic literature of the Vedas. More than any other literary
genre produced on the Indian subcontinent, they allow us to feel the
pulse o f Indic humanity. After a lifelong study of Eastern spiritual
traditions, Thomas Berry, a historian of culture, felt called to make
the following remark about the Vedic heritage:
In quality, in quantity,, in sig n jfican cefor m an 's intellectual,
cultural, and spiritu al Ijfe, this literature in its totality, is un
su rp assed am ong a ll oth er literary traditions o f th e world. 6
The ability to preserve this comprehensive literature against the
ravages of time is itself an incredible achievement. India, like the
rest of the world, suffered repeated foreign invasions— at the hands
of the Yueh-chi nomads from China, the Shaka (Sakai) nomads from
the northwest, the Greeks (under Alexander the Great), and the Huns.
They all wreaked havoc to varying degrees. Particularly during the
devastating Muslim invasions in the long period from 1000 a .d . to
1700 a .d ., many schools, monasteries, temples, and not least librar
ies were erased.
18 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



Equally, if not more, destructive was the British Raj. When, in
the eighteenth century, imperialist politics and profiteering led to the
formation of the British rule in India, an all-out attempt was made to
Christianize and modernize the country by discrediting Hindu cul
ture. In the words o f Lord Macaulay, one of the architects o f the
British Raj, the goal was to create a new breed o f Anglo-Indians,
who were “Indian in blood and colour but English in taste, in morals
and in intellect." Nevertheless, the encounter with the West also
spurred a spiritual and cultural renaissance in India, and Western
scholarship has played no small role in India's rediscovery o f its own
splendid past marked by cultural and spiritual greatness.
Apart from the destructive impact ofthevarious invasions, India’s
heritage had to contend with another foe—the inclement weather.
The subcontinent possesses a tropical climate that is hostile to the
preservation of books, whether printed on paper or written on palm
leaves. That India nonetheless succeeded in maintaining its ancient
literature with a completeness and accuracy unparalleled in the world
attests to the utmost reverence in which that tradition has been held
by the Hindus.
Pathw ays o f Interp retation
While the actual Vedic texts, as mentioned above, have been pre
served with extraordinary fidelity, their meaning has in many in
stances become a matter of interpretation. This should not surprise
us given the passage of time and the numerous cultural changes
through the millennia. But it is a source of dogmatic quibbling among
the Hindus themselves and of scholarly controversy among West
erners looking in upon the Hindu tradition from the outside.
There exist several Sanskrit commentaries on the Rig- Veda, some
of which are quite old and all of which are fragmentary or incom
plete. The most famous and only complete commentaty was authored
rather late, in the fourteenth century, by Sayana, who was a great
scholar and mentor of King Bukka 1 o f Vijayanagar in South India.
Although one or two pioneers ofVedic research thought that Sayana's
explanations would suffice to unlock the secrets of the Rig- Veda,
THE VEDAS-. PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 19



most researchers quickly arrived at a different and more correct opin
ion. They realized that Sayana's commentary did not deal with the
inner meaning of the Vedas but only provided elucidations o f the
outer or ritualist significance of the R ig-V eda and the three other
Vedic hymnodies. In his explanations, Sayana relied greatly on such
early works as the B rahm an as and A ran yakas. However, unlike
modern ritualistic commentators, he did not deny the deeper level of
meaning in the Vedas.
Like most ancient documents, the Vedas are a composite of sym
bol, metaphor, allegory, myth, and story, as well as paradox and riddle.
Additionally, much of the communicated wisdom seems to be in a
secret code that was intelligible only to initiates. Not surprisingly,
modern historians and archaeologists, who come from an entirely
different intellectual and cultural background in which esotericism is
frowned on, by and large have been unable to make any sense of the
Vedic hymns. Ever since the first German renderings of the Sam a
Veda by Theodor Benfey in 1848 and of the Rig-V eda by Hermann
Grassmann and Alfred Ludwig in the last quarter o f the nineteenth
century, Western scholars have tackled this difficult text from vari
ous angles. Despite more than a century of scholarly labor, however,
we have yet to reach the essence of the Vedic corpus and unlock its
spiritual secrets. In this respect, the Vedas are like the Cheops pyra
mid, which has been pried into by various means—from primitive
iron tools used by treasure hunters long ago to sophisticated elec
tronic equipment—but which has not yet yielded its secret.
The underlying reasons for this inability to comprehend the deeper
meaning of the Vedas are the same as those that have made it diffi
cult to interpret the archaeological evidence for the ancient Indic civi
lization: an ideological bias arising from Eurocentric ideas, Western
religious preconceptions, and a certain disregard for spiritual percep
tion, esotericism, or mysticism. We must recall that, in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries when Europeans rediscovered the Vedas,
Europe was in ascendancy and held much of the world under its
military and economic domination. Asia and Africa were considered
cultural backwaters and were subjected to various degrees of slavety
and exploitation. India was without question the most important
20 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



colony o f the British empire, bringing to Britain's treasury an abun
dance of much-needed revenue.
Western countries have also had a persistent and strong mis
sionary and reformist motivation toward Asian cultures, attempting
to both modernize and Christianize them. Hindu culture proved a
great obstacle to these efforts, and in the early days the study and
interpretation o f the Vedic literature by Western scholars was often
tainted with a hidden motive to discredit the Vedas and undermine
native religious and social traditions. Western thinkers found Hin
duism to be a bewildering motley of numerous deities and strange
mystic cults. As a rule, they had little appreciation for the religious
and spiritual traditions of India, ancient or modern.
Even those few who were impressed with the nondualist logic of
Vedanta philosophy generally displayed little interest in, or under
standing of, the ritual. symbolic, or mythological aspects of the vast
Hindu tradition. The great majority o f scholars dismissed India’s great
mystics, saints, and sages as beggars, magicians, madmen, or char
latans. Out of touch with spiritual or yogic practice and ignorant of
meditation and higher states of awareness, European scholars typi
cally denied the Vedas any deeper meaning. Instead they viewed them
as unintelligible mumbo-jumbo or, at best, primitive poetry. They
believed to have discovered in the Vedic hymns an archaic ritualism
intent on propitiating the forces o f Nature in an attempt to secure
sustenance and shelter or the timely arrival of the rains. The attitude
of regarding the Vedas as relics o f a primitive mentality has effec
tively prevented us from understanding the core of the Vedic mes
sage. The charge of primitivism, literary or otherwise, has been re
futed by historian Thomas Berry, who made the following apprecia
tive statement about the Vedas-.
This hym nal literature is n ot “prim itive. " It is highly d ev el
oped in its literaryfon n , in its intellectual insight, an d in its

1\ventieth-century Western scholars have seldom shown such
sensitivity. They have tended to read the Vedas in the light of mod
ern psychology, sociology, or anthropology. With few exceptions, they
have failed to explore the texts from a spiritual standpoint, which is
at the heart of the Vedic heritage. Nor have they looked into the math
ematical and astronomical code of Vedic symbolism, which was an
important part of that tradition. Their readings of the Vedas often tell
more about twentieth-century trends and problems than they do about
the Vedic era.
This is particularly true in the case of Marxist historians, who
still dominate the institutes of higher learning in India itself. They
consider the Vedas as documents of class struggle, in which the elit
ist priesthood of invading Aryan tribes exploited the native popula
tion. In fact, this theoty reflects not what actually occurred at the
time of the Vedas but what happened during the British Raj thou
sands of years later.
The charge of Eurocentrism is not new. It was leveled against
Western scholarship more than half a century ago by the French sa
vant René Guénon. In his book Introduction to th e Study o f the Hindu
D octñnes, he referred to this bias as the “classical prejudice," ex
plaining it as “the predisposition to attribute the origin of all civiliza
tion to the Greeks and R o m an s." Guénon observed:

Guénon's criticism of scholarly myopia still applies in many

THE V E D A S : PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 23
instances. We must also not forget that Eurocentrism is undermined
by the testimony of the classical writers themselves, who made it
clear that many o f the Greeks’ most precious ideas were inspired, if
not borrowed, from the Egyptians. As Plato records in his Tim aeus,
the Egyptians looked upon the Greeks as mere children in the evolu
tion of human civilization. Thales, Solon, and Pythagoras sat at the
feet of Egyptian philosophers.
But where did the Egyptians themselves get their wisdom? We
know that they owed a great debt to the learned men and sages o f
India. There was a colony of Indic people in Memphis as long ago as
5 0 0 B .c . But Egypt's connection with India may go back much far
ther in time. Indeed, there are many curious parallels between Egyp
tian and Indic mythology and symbolism, which deserve careful in
vestigation .
Moreover, learned men and ascetics from India are known to have
visited Greece, and some o f the greatest Greek thinkers are said to
have traveled in India. The impact of Indic traditions on the influen
tial religions of Orphism and Manicheanism and also on the spiritual
movement of Neoplatonism has been acknowledged by many ex
perts. Also, the Essenes of Palestine and the Therapeutae o f Alexan
dria appear to have incorporated philosophical and other elements
from India's rich philosophical heritage. We say more about the West
ern world's indebtedness to India in Chapter 13.
In any case, modern scholars all too often make pronouncements
about the Vedas on the basis of a few select Vedic passages and the
doubtful comments of an earlier generation of Vedic specialists. The
fact is that there are only a handful of Indologists who have thor
ough firsthand knowledge of the Vedas, which are composed in a
difficult archaic form of Sanskrit that intimidates all but the most
intrepid researchers. But even such researchers may never have stud
ied the Vedic ritual or philosophy, which alone makes the hymns
intelligible. Thus, there is a tendency to take hymns out of context in
order to substantiate favored theories without providing a consistent
or comprehensive interpretation of the Vedic tradition as a whole.
Nevertheless, it must be said that even traditional Hindu inter
pretations of the Vedas generally fail to do justice to their deeper



meaning and significance. The Vedas were already archaic and ob
scure texts by the time of the Buddha, so much so that even early
Sanskrit commentators—like their modern counterparts—complained
that the Vedas made no sense. A similar complaint can be brought
against other ancient works of spiritual import, such as the so-called
Pyramid Texts of the fifth and sixth dynasties, the Egyptian B ook q f
th e D ead, or the Chinese I Ching, which demand a great deal of knowl
edge and a particular kind of sensitivity on the part of the translator
in order to yield at least some o f their hidden meanings.
Even at its best, interpretation is a task beset with difficulties. In
her 1981 book The R ig Veda, which contains renderings of 108
hymns, Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty made the point that translators
are “painters rather than photographers, and painters make mistakes."
Of course, even photography is interpretive and thus liable to distor
tion. At any rate, Doniger O'Flaherty was right when she said that
“translations made ten years from now would probably be . . . differ
ent." 10However, the degree of difference can be expected to be slight
in those scholarly renderings that continue to project the Eurocentric
bias on their object of study. Real progress in the translation o f the
ancient Vedic corpus will be made only when that bias is recognized
and removed and when the Vedas are seen for the profoundly spiri
tual literature that they are. 11 Voicing a kindred view, the British
Vedicist Jeanine Miller, who fully appreciates the spiritual dimension
o f the Vedas, remarks:
Vedic thought, esp ecially with reg ard to m editation and
eschatology, reveals an unexam pled depth q f insight into
th e intricacies q ft h e hum an mind, th e background p h iloso
p h y q f w hich w as th e root q f a ll subsequent speculations.

ancestors, th e ben eficen tpatriarchs w hose heirloom w as-their
treasure and th efou n d ation o f th eir civilization. 12
In order to give the Vedas a fuller hearing, Miller also had to
distance herself from the popular understanding of mythology. As
she explains, myth is not merely an entertaining made-up story but
a pictograph o f great evocative power that is intended to connect us
to the reality which it purports to image. It is a representation o f the
living truth of the sacred reality or realities. Vedic myth, as Miller
affirms, “depicts in dramatic terms certain insights realised in deep
absorption such as characterises every mystic." 13In other words, the
Vedas- are the product of a mature introspective culture, which, un
like our own postmodern civilization, w as firmly grounded in the
direct perception and interaction with the unseen world o f numinous
beings and forces.
The idea of a spiritual or symbolic interpretation of the Vedas- is
clearly articulated in the Brahm anas- and U panishads, which speak
of the meaning of the sacred Vedic utterances (m antra) on the level
of the innermost self (adhyatm a). The same idea is mentioned by
the oldest Vedic commentators, such as Yaska (sixth century B.c.)
and the slightly later Shaunaka. In his N irukta (“Explanation"), Yaska
explains a number of Vedic hymns from a spiritual (adhyatm ika)
perspective, but he offers samples rather than a complete examina
tion. No extensive texts about the esoteric significance of the Vedic
hymns have survived from ancient times. Vast as the available Vedic
literature is, it represents a fraction of what was once available. Many
of the extant works refer to no longer available scriptures and to
authorities about whom nothing but the name is known. This loss is
not surprising from another point o f view: It would appear that in the
course of their development, all spiritual and religious traditions tend
to move from living spirituality, which is mystical in its core, toward
external ritualism and formalism.
In contrast to much ofWestern scholarship, several modern Hindu
scholars have championed an interpretation of the Vedas- in terms of
a deeper spiritual meaning. Here we must single out Sri Aurobindo,
Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, Sri Anirvan, and Ganapati Muni. Other



lesser known Vedic teachers in India, who did not write in English,
entertained similar views. Sri Aurobindo, one of modern India's great
est mystics and sages, saw the Vedas as expressing a spiritual vision
o f the highest order. In fact, he detected in them the antecedents of
his own supramental or integral world-transforming Yoga. Aurobindo
criticized Western scholarship as follows:
Is th ere a t a ll o r is th ere still a secret e f th e Veda ? A ccording
to cu n en t conceptions th e heart e f th a t ancient mystery has been plucked out and revealed to the g aze efa ll, or rather no
real secret ev er existed. 14
Aurobindo continued:
The ritual system recognised by Sayana may, in its exter
nalities, stan d; th e naturalistic sen se discovered by Euro
pean scholarship mqy, in itsg en eral conceptions, b e accepted;
bu t behin d them there is alw ays th e true an d still hidden
secret e ft h e Veda, - t h e secret w o r d s . . . w hich were spoken
f o r th e p u rjfied in sou l an d th e aw aken ed in know ledge. 15
Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, the famous nineteenth-century
social reformer and founder of the Arya Samaj, looked upon the Vedas
as a source for his own message o f monotheism, emancipation of
women, and the removal o f caste prejudices. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,
who brought Transcendental Meditation to the West, similarly re
gards the Vedas as containing fundamental insights into all levels of
existence— from gross matter to pure consciousness. While we need
not uncritically endorse every interpretation that these traditional
authorities have put forward, we would clearly benefit from consid
ering their views in an unprejudiced manner.
A somewhat kinder climate of opinion exists in certain progres
sive circles o f psychology—notably transpersonal psychology—which
take cognizance of the fact that, as we change our state of conscious
ness, we begin to encounter the world differently, or different levels
o f the world. This promising new attitude is summed up well by
psychiatrist Roger Walsh, one of the leading figures of transpersonal
psychology:
26 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE VEDAS: PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 2 7

The kind o f epistemological openness proposed by Walsh is es
sential if we want to comprehend nonmodern, traditional ways of
thought and their ritual expressions. Walsh himself has shown the
advantages of such a relaxed stance relative to Shamanism. In his
book The Spirit efS h am an ism , he observes how psychiatrists and
psychoanalytically minded anthropologists have typically misdiag
nosed certain shamanic experiences and behavior patterns as “hys
teria” or “schizophrenia." They have done so, in his view, despite
“considerable evidence to the contrary." 17 As a consequence, they
have failed to appreciate the deeper and quite positive aspects of Sha
manism. A similar tragic misdiagnosis has barred us from under
standing the spiritual message of the Vedas. We, sadly, may add the
Vedic seers to Walsh's to-the-point remark that “Yogis, saints, sha
mans, and sages have thus all been chopped down to neurotic size. "18
The Scope o f V edic L iteratu re
We have, then, in the Vedas a formidable body of literature that
not only allows us to glimpse into the culture and mind of a people
who were intensely committed to a spiritual view of the world but
that, indirectly, also offers a valuable commentary on our problem
ridden contemporaty world. Having hopefully set the stage for a more
discerning attitude toward the Vedas, we will next provide a thumb
nail sketch of the four Vedic “collections" (sam h fritas) that to this day
inspire Hindus with sacred awe.



The Rig-Veda
The principal and, taken in its totality, the oldest of the four Vedic
hymnodies is the R ig-V eda. The Sanskrit word ric, which for eu
phonic reasons is changed to rig, means literally “praise." It refers to
a “chant” or “hymn" in praise of the Divine. Each hymn is also called
a m antra or sacred “utterance" charged with numinous power.
The composers o f the hymns were inspired or illumined seers
because they saw or envisioned the truths which they so eloquently
communicated in their verse compositions. According to Jeanine Miller,
the Vedic seers proceeded by means of what she calls “visioning"
and contemplation. As she explains:
Visioning m ay m ean receiving know ledge a s in a fia s h and
thereby intuitively knowing, or it m ay m ean “seeing" certain
realities beyon d the world o f the senses, both m eans im ply
ing direct apprehension q f certain troths th at do n otfall within
thefie ld o f ordinary hum an sensuous experience. Contem
p latin g im plies m editation, th e stead y focu sin g o f the inner
in sight upon a particu lar object, o r idea, o r vision. Intellec tual iriferences an d logical deductions do play their parts,
bu t they are secondary an d only m eans o f explaining an d
expandin g upon w hat h a s been seen or discovered in a
supram ental sta te q f consciousness. 19
In the R ig-V eda itself, the seers are called “poets." However, the
Sanskrit equivalent, kavi, implies much more than what we mean by
a poet. More than gifted wordsmiths, the kavis were golden-tongued
visionaries, who, in their spiritual illumination, gave expression to
divine truths. They were recipients and revealers of the invisible or
der o f the cosmos. Their ideas were not just clever thoughts but in
spired insights or illumined visions. The Vedic Sanskrit term for this
higher awareness is dhi—a word related to the later term dhyana,
meaning “meditation" or “contemplation."
Because the hymns were seen or envisioned by wise folk, the
Vedas as a whole are considered sacred revelation (shrutz). If we see
less in them, it is because of our own cultural lens, which is cut in

such a way as to reflect to us a purely secularized world, lacking in
awe as well as in wonders and miracles.
There are a total of 1,028 hymns (including eleven supplemen
tary hymns) comprising 10,589 verses in the R ig-V eda, which are
distributed over ten chapters, called m an datas (“circles" or “cycles").
The hymns were composed in various periods and by many indi
viduals. The Rig- Veda is the oldest book in the Sanskrit language,
indeed in any Indo-European language. More than that, if we are
correct, it is the oldest book in the world, and for this reason alone
deserves our attention. As noted earlier, it is a special kind of book,
because for countless generations it was carried in the memory of a
few select individuals capable of remembering every last syllable of
this sacred corpus.
Generally speaking, the hymns o f the Rig-V eda show consider

able poetic sophistication and spiritual depth. They are inspired out
pourings of visionaries, or illumined ones, whose clairvoyant sight
penetrated the fog of the material world and who were still able to
commune with the luminous beings—Gods and Goddesses—of higher
realms, invisible to the eye unaided by meditation.
The Vedic pantheon is said to comprise "thrice eleven” deities.
The actual number of Gods and Goddesses addressed in the Rig
Veda is higher, especially when one counts each of the Maruts sepa
rately. These deities, who are associated with wind, storm, and
breath, are said to number “thrice seven" or “thrice sixty." Som e
times the thirty-three deities are expanded into 3 ,3 3 9 . At any rate,
only about twenty of the Vedic deities have three hymns or more
addressed to them.
There are around 2 5 0 hymns in praise of Indra, whose light
ning thunderbolt causes havoc among demons and enemies, who
releases the waters to flow into the ocean, who recovered the sa
cred som a draught, and who reveals the light of the sun. Around
2 0 0 hymns invoke God Agni, who descends from the sun into the
sacred sacrificial fire and teaches human beings the secret of the
births of the deities. Over 100 hymns are dedicated to God Soma,
whose mystety is embodied in the immortal nectar (also called som a)
that is consumed by the illumined sages to stimulate their vision
ary experiences. Fewer but no less edifying hymns are addressed
to other deities like God Varuna, the guardian of the cosmic order;
the Ashvins, or heavenly twins, who are supreme healers and teach
the secret knowledge; Goddess Ushas (Aurora in Latin), who makes
her presence felt in the golden splendor of dawn; Goddess Aditi,
the embodiment of primordial boundlessness; Goddess Sarasvati,
who is embodied in the once mighty river named after her and who
can be considered the patron deity of the ancient Vedic civilization
as a whole.
Some scholars believe to have detected different strata of thought
in this hymnody, ranging from naturalistic polytheism to mono
theism and m onism .20 Max Müller even coined a new term
henotheism — in order to explain the tendency in the Vedas to ascribe
supremacy now to one deity and later to another, as if they all were
30 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE VEDAS: PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 31
perfectly interchangeable. He saw this as a form o f religiosity hover
ing between polytheism and monotheism. However, the teaching of
many deities who are simultaneously one is the same idea found in
later Hinduism, where deities like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, and their
consorts are all deemed aspects of the same supreme Reality, the
Godhead. The various attempts to read an evolution o f thought into
the Vedas remain unconvincing and in this case also unverifiable,
because we have no dates for particular hymns or chapters.
Contrary to the opinion of one widely respected Western scholar,
the Vedic hymns were n ot meant “to puzzle, to surprise, to trouble
the mind. ”21 No such purpose would have occurred to the Vedic sages,
whose intent, if anything, was to alleviate confusion and suffering.
What seems far more likely, those few hymns that are in the form of
riddles served the purpose of awakening higher intuition. Like Zen
koans, some of the Vedic riddles may well have no logical solution,
but the creative tension in them is resolved at a higher level, when
the perplexed mind is transcended and beholds the truth. In the case
of other Vedic riddles, the answers were undoubtedly known to ini
tiates who were the main audience for which the Vedas were origi
nally intended. In this connection, we also must remind ourselves
that the hymns were not intended to be merely edifying or entertain
ing, but they played an essential role in the context o f Vedic ritual
ism. We will say more about this shortly.
The Vedic hymns were composed in an older type of linguistic
framework wherein the abstract and the concrete, the spiritual and
the material, are not so rigidly differentiated as in modern tongues.
It is therefore inappropriate and unproductive to judge the hymns
by means o f the materialistic languages o f modern tim es. Like any
mystic poetty, they require the right angle of vision for a fuller ap
preciation.
T he Sam a-Veda
The Sam a- Veda can be looked upon as a liturgical manual for
the chanting or singing of the Vedic hymns. Most o f its 1,875 stan
zas were incorporated from the Rig- Veda, and only seventy-five verses

are original to the Sam a-V eda. The Sanskrit word sam an, which is
pronounced with a long first a , means “song” or “melody." A related
word is sam a (with two short a sounds), meaning “evenness" or
“equanimity." This second connotation also applies to the Vedic
chants, which are songs of propitiation, by which the deities are in
voked in their gentle and pleasing nature. To reach the deities with
his chants, the priest first had to become calm. That is because com
munication with the higher realms was known to depend on the laws
of resonance: Only a tranquil mind can hope to contact the divine
beings who are established in harmony.
The text of the Sam a- Veda contains no clues about the melodies
to which the verses were to be sung. These were taught by direct
transmission, through hearing the songs. A few Sam a-V eda singers
can still be found in India today, who learned their craft from a teacher
who knew how to chant the hymns. However, at a later time, song
books were created that, in addition to the musical notation, indi
cated which syllables had to be prolonged or repeated during sing
ing. There were also syllab les-like hun, hin, h a i, hau, hoyi, h u v a
that had to be interpolated at certain points of the song, similar to
the medieval European plain song of the ninth and tenth centuries.
A large number of melodies were known, which those studying the
Sam a- Veda had to master thoroughly. In his outline of the religious
literature of India, J. N. Farquhar commented on the rigors of a tradi
tional pupilage in the schools of Sam a- Veda as follows:

THE V E D A S : PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 33
The Y aju r-V eda
The third venerated collection of hymns is the Y qur- Veda. The
w ord ^^ to (which, for grammatical reasons, is changed to y qju r) is
derived from the rootyq/, meaning “to sacrifice.” Thus the Yqjur
Veda consists of hymns that are in the form of sacrificial formulas
or prayers. About a
third of its 1 ,975
verses, distributed
over forty chapters,
are taken from the
Rig-Veda-, the rest
is original and in
prose. The text is
arranged in the or
der in which it was
and still is used in
the ceremonies. Un
like the Sam a- Veda,
which exclusively
contains hymns
that are relevant to
the soma sacrifice, the Yqjur- Veda includes formulas for all sacri
fices, including those of a purely internal and spiritual nature.
The Yqjur- Veda was compiled toward the end of the Vedic era.
This is evident, among other things, from the many versions or re
censions o f it that have survived. The core of the home territory of
the Yqjur-Veda is known as the “field of the Kuru tribe” (kuru
kshetra), where the great war of the Bharatas was fought. In his
O.iford H istory India, Vincent A. Smith rightly stated that the Y qw
Veda helps to bridge the gap between the R ig- Veda and what we now
know as Hinduism.23
The religion reflected in the Yqur-V eda, though remaining true
to the principles of the earlier R ig- Veda, shows many new develop
ments. Certain deities, such as Prajapati (“Father o f Creatures”),
Vishnu, and Rudra-Shiva attained greater prominence. But, above

all, the sacerdotal ritualism assumed vast and complicated propor
tions. The brahmins had become highly specialized religious experts,
and many scholars have seen in their religious practice a degree of
mechanicalness that contrasts to the earlier spontaneity of the Rig
Veda. Indian philosopher and statesman Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
made this observation:
In the history e f thought creative an d critical epochs succeed
each other. Periods q frich an d g low in g faith arefollow ed by
th ose e f aridity an d artjficiality. When w e p a ssfrom th e Rig
Veda to th e Yajur an d th e Sama-Vedas an d th e Brahmanas,

e f th e Rig-Veda an d arran ged to su it sacrjficial necessities.
The priest becom es th e lord . . . The religion e f th e Yajur
Veda is a m echan ical sacerdotalism . 24
While there is truth to Radhakrishnan's comments, they also re
flect exposure to Western scholarly stereotypes. Proliferation of sac
rificial concerns and a tendency toward formalism, overspecializa
tion, as well as speculative elaboration, were certainly aspects of the
late Vedic religion at the time of the Ygiur- Veda and the Brahm anas.
Yet we must not lose sight of the fact that underlying these develop
ments was a profound sacrificial spirituality. Thus, like the other
Vedic collections, the Ygiur- Veda can be understood as promoting an
inward, spiritual attitude within the framework of the Vedic sacrifi
cial religion. Offering the mind and the senses to the Divine was as
important as the elaborate external ritual.
The Atharva-Veda
The fourth and final hymnody is the A tharva- Veda, which re
ceived its name from the seer Atharvan who belonged to one of the
greatest seer families in Vedic times. This collection contains 731
34 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE V E D A S : PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 3 5
hymns comprising 5 ,9 7 7 verses distributed over twenty chapters.
About one-fifth of the hymns are drawn from the R ig- Veda. As a
collection, the A tharva- Veda is generally thought to have been com
posed in an era considerably more recent than the R ig- Veda. How
ever, it is quite possible, as some experts have suggested, that indi
vidual hymns of this hymnody may be as old as the oldest hymns of
the Rig- Veda. Still, the language of Atharvan's collection of hymns is
younger than that of the R ig- Veda.
The status of the A tharva- Veda as part of the sacred Vedic rev
elation has from the beginning been rather controversial. An appar
ently late hymn of the R ig-V eda (X .90.9) refers only to the three
Vedas, omitting the A tharva- Veda. A similar custom was maintained
by some later Sanskrit authorities, while others acknowledged the
existence of four Vedas. In part, the reason for highlighting the three
Vedas was symbolic: They were regarded as corresponding to the
threefold hierarchy of the world. When a fourfold cosmological
schema was used, the authorities did not hesitate to make reference
to four Vedas.
Yet it is true that many Vedic thinkers have had an ambivalent
attitude toward the A tharva- Veda, largely because this hymnody con
tains many spells and incantations that are not used in the orthodox
ritual ceremonies. At the same time, however, it also includes many
hymns with a medical or healing intent, such as prayers for health
and the commonweal. In many ways, the A tharva-V eda foreshad
ows the syncretism of medieval Tantrism, where spiritual practice,
sorcery, and medicine are often closely intertwined. Here we must
note that sorcery and medicine are also found in the hymns of the
Rig- Veda, though they are not given the same prominence as in the
A tharva- Veda.
The A tharva- Veda describes itself as part of the Vedic literature
and as a creation of the same seer families that also produced the
other Vedic hymnodies. It nowhere criticizes the other Vedas, but on
the contraty glorifies them as voicing the same great metaphysical
understanding. Moreover, it contains many hymns from the Rig-V eda
and the YYqjur- Veda, which clearly evinces its legitimate status as a
part of the Vedic canon.



TheRitual Dimension Qfthe Vedas
In the traditional scheme of the three Vedas, the R ig- Veda can be
said to represent the sacred utterance, the Sam a- Veda stands for the
sacred song or the inner meaning of the hymns, while the Yqjur
Veda embodies the dimension of ritual action. Viewed from this per
spective, the three Vedas are not separate texts but distinct and re
lated aspects of the same teaching: the word, its meaning, and the
action arising from it. The A tharva- Veda is sometimes said to repre
sent the word as power. Hindu traditionalists have drawn up the
following correspondences:
R ig-V eda : divine speech : earth : fire : waking
Yigw- Veda : divine mind : atmosphere : wind : dream
Sam a- Veda : divine breath : heaven : sun : deep sleep
According to another schema found in the M anu-Sam hita
(IV. 123), an ancient Sanskrit work on moral conduct, the Rig-V eda
relates to the deities, the Yqjur- Veda to human concerns, and the
Sam a- Veda to the ancestral spirits. Such traditionalist models are
helpful in understanding the native worldview with its wealth of
unsuspected correlations.
Generation after generation, there have been those who follow
and preserve the teachings of the Rig-Veda-, those who memorize
and chant the Sam a- Veda; those who preserve and employ the sacri
ficial prayers of the Yigur- Veda; and those who are faithful custodi
ans of the tradition of the A tharva- Veda. The daily chanting and
performance of Vedic rituals continues in India to this day in an un
broken tradition that spans several millennia.
At this point, an important fact needs to be stated. The perform
ers of Vedic worship cannot be regarded as priests in the ordinary
sense. Vedic religion was in principle a private affair. The home was
the temple, though we need not rule out the existence of temples as
special places o f worship during that early period. The oldest sur
viving temples stem from the Gupta period (fourth century a .d .) ,
but there is no reason to assume that temples fashioned from wood,
brick, and clay did not have a long history by then. Greek travelers
36 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



in the pre-Christian era, for example, reported seeing numerous
temples .in India.
Yet, Vedic religion revolved around the daily worship at the do
mestic fire altar. Both men and women were empowered to establish
their own personal connection to the Divine through the age-old in
stitution of ritual worship. The brahmins were simply available as
officiants who could assist the individual worshiper. They special
ized in performing the more complex rituals on behalf o f an entire
community or the king.
The Vedic tradition distinguishes between two comprehensive
categories of sacrifice—-g rih a-y ajn as (domestic sacrifices) and
shrauta-y-yqjnas (public sacrificial ceremonies). The former category
comprises the various simple domestic sacrifices undertaken in the
privacy of the home. The ritual performers were husband and wife,
who were sometimes, though not necessarily, aided by a brahmin
(who, in those days, could also be a woman). In Vedic times, every
householder was permitted and expected to keep a daily schedule of
prayers and sacrificial rituals, which were performed at the hearth.
These domestic ceremonies included the daily morning and evening
offerings and special sacrifices on the occasion o f a birth, childhood
initiation, marriage, and death.
The shrau ta (“heard") categoty comprises various public sacri
fices, which tended to be complicated and long, drawn-out affairs,
calling for an assembly o f priests, each of whom had a distinct func
tion.25 There were four principal priests—the hotri, adhvaryu , ud
g atri, and brahm an a (brahmin). Some ceremonies, however, called
for seven or eight and, toward the end of the Vedic era, even sixteen
priests. The hotri recited the hymns of the Rig-V eda. The adhvaryu
was the chief officiant, who constructed the fire altar, tended the fire,
handled the utensils, and prepared the oblations. The udgatn' recited
the hymns addressed to God Soma and chanted the songs relating to
the deities of the hymns recited by the hotri. The brahmin silently
oversaw the ceremony, ensuring that the rituals were accurately per
formed. In case of error, he quickly performed the prescribed rituals
ofexpiation. More than the otherthree main priests, he was the holder
of the sacred power (brahm an).
THE VEDAS: PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 37



T he R itu al L ite ra tu re : The Brahm anas an d Aranyakas
Associated with each Veda are various explanatory or subsidiary
scriptures, which also are deemed to be revealed knowledge. These
fall into the genres of B rahm an as (or ritual texts), A ranyakas (texts
for forest dwellers), and U panishads (esoteric scriptures). There are
more than a dozen B rahm an as, which consist primarily of explica
tions of the Vedic hymns and practical instructions for the priests.
Over the millennia, the Vedic ritual grew more and more complex,
calling for specialists who had the specific task of memorizing not
only the numerous hymns but also their melodies and accompany
ing ritual gestures and the obligation to acquire and keep alive the
astronomical and calendrical knowledge necessary for the Vedic sac
rificial ceremonies.
The brahmins arose as a priestly class as a result of the ever
more comprehensive and exacting sacrificial ritualism, with its intri
cate cosmology, psychology, and metaphysics. Thus, step by step,
the home-based Vedic religious practice was replaced by a profes
sional class of hereditary priests, who made the sacrifice ever more
elaborate. As can be expected, this sacerdotal professionalism Jed to
a certain haughty exclusiveness as well as exploitation of the reli
gious community. Rather than being a means to an end, as in early
Vedic times, the sacrifice almost became an end in itself, and the
original piety often became replaced by ostentation. This situation
finally provoked the kind of criticism found in the U panishads and
the early Buddhist scriptures. They spoke out against excessive and
barren ritualism, lacking in wisdom and mystical experience. The
C handogya-U panishad (1.12.1-4). for instance, contains a satire on
priestly chanting. Here a certain Baka Dalbhya, who had gone forth
to study the Vedas, is portrayed as instructing a band of hungry dogs
in chanting “Om. May we eat! Om. May we drink . . . O Lord of Food,
bring food here! Bring it! Om."
The B rahm an a scriptures are perhaps even less understood and
appreciated by modern scholars than the Vedas themselves. Last cen
tury, Max Müller said of them that they “deserve to be studied as the
physician studies the twaddle of idiots, and the raving of madmen."20
38 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



One modern scholar compared them in obscurity only to the Gnostic
texts.27 Though intended as a slur, this comparison is valid. For the
B rahm anas, like the Gnostic scriptures, are mystical treatises. Fortu
nately, there has been a movement in scholarly circles toward a reap
praisal of these works. It is now recognized that the B rahm an as con
tain teachings of considerable psychological sophistication. Some
recent works of modern Western scholarship have opened the door
for a deeper appreciation of the B rahm an as, and these mark an im
portant new approach to them, radically different from the nineteenth
century view. 28
The A ranyakas are scriptures similar to the B rahm an as, but in
tended for those “twice-born” (or duly initiated) men and women
who, having fulfilled their householder duties, live in solitude in the
forest (aranya). Their ritual obligations are somewhat different from
those of householders. The focus is on certain particularly powerful
and hence potentially dangerous rites that lead to ritual purity fol
lowed by the awakening of mystical powers. The element of danger
in them is that they can ruin the life of an individual who prema
turely abandons his or her householder existence. Much like the
U panishads, the A ran yakas also contain a number of meditational
and devotional teachings, and they stand midway between the
B rahm anas and the U panishads.
THE V E D A S : PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 39
The E so te ric L ite ra tu re : The U panishads
The U panishads, which are magnificent Gnostic treatises in the
broad sense, form the capstone of the Vedic edifice. They are the best
known aspect ofVedic literature and have been lauded by great think
ers throughout the world. The German philosopher Arthur
Schopenhauer said o f them that they were a comfort to him in his life
and his death. He also remarked:
H ow every line is e fs u c h strong, determined,, an d con sisten t
m eaning! A nd on every p ag e w e encounter deep, original,
hefty thoughts, w hile the w hole is s i e f s e d with a high and
holy seriousness. TM



In his survey ofphilosophical systems and approaches, the Ameri
can professor of philosophy Abraham Kaplan commented that the
U panishads are “remarkable in literary quality as well as in con
tent. ”30 Max Müller, who was critical of many aspects of the Vedic
heritage, confessed toward the end of his life:
The conception e f th e w orld a s deduced.from th e Veda, an d
chieflyifiom th e Upanishads, is in deed astounding?'
Müller not only edited and translated the Rig-V eda but also of
fered translations of the major U panishads, and his introduction to
Vedanta philosophy is still useful today. Robert Ernest Hume, whose
renderings of thirteen principal U panishads published in 1921 are
still widely read, wrote:
In the long history e f m an's endeavor to g rasp the.funda
m en tal truths e f being, th e m etaphysical treatises know n a s th e Upanishads hold an hon ored p la c e . . . they are replete

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a former president of India and trans
lator of eighteen of more than two hundred U panishads, noted:

THE VEDAS: PYRAMIDS OF THE SPIRIT ^ 41
about 9 00 B.c., but by our reckoning belong to a still earlier period,
one can perceive all the cardinal philosophical tenets of Hinduism:
karma, rebirth, Self-realization through wisdom or gnosis (jn a n a ),
the ultimate unity of existence, and introspection and meditation as
means to spiritual liberation. These ideas have generally been de
scribed as innovations of the Upanishadic sages. However, in many
ways they are faithful to the early Vedic heritage, though giving it
new expression. They are the building blocks of the metaphysical
tradition of V ed an ta-a word that means literally “Veda’s end."
Although the U panishads, having been composed over a huge
span of time, give expression to many schools of thought, the gen
eral thrust of their teachings is toward nondualism (a d v a ita ). This
philosophical orientation is based on the fundamental assumption
that, ultimately, all things are one, that the innermost essence of the
human being is the very same essence that underlies the universe at
large.
Without this fundamental unity, spiritual liberation would be
impossible. For such liberation is the realization of that unity, be
yond the constantly changing human world and beyond even the
heavenly realms of the Gods and Goddesses. That ultimate unity is
called brahm an (when viewed objectively) and atm an (when viewed
subjectively, as the Self). Self-realization brings an end to finitude
and suffering. The Self is complete in itself, immortal, and blissful.
In the words of Yajnavalkya, perhaps the greatest sage whose voice
is recorded in the B n hadaran yaka-U pan ishad (IV.5.15), which may
be the earliest work of this genre:
The S elf (atman) is n o t this, n o t th at (neti neti). It is un
graspable because it cannot b e grasped. I t is indestructible
because it cannot be destroyed. It is unattached becau se it
d oes n ot attach itself[to anything]. Being urfettered, it d oes
not s e fe r ; it can n ot b e injured.
Such nondualist teachings have often been blamed by Western
outsiders for India's supposed failure to create a successful material
civilization. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Just as the Vedic
seers and sages have given rise in subsequent centuries to an unpar



alleled profusion of metaphysical ideas and lofty spiritual ideals in
the wisdom schools, they also have provided the impetus for inge
nious and diversified scientific and other secular knowledge. This
knowledge can be found embedded in the rich secondary literature
on astronomy, mathematics, medicine, architecture, grammar, pho
netics, etymology, art, music, dance, sexology, statecraft, weaponry,
and ethics in general.
Tim ing the T im eless W isdom
So far we have deliberately said nothing of the age of the Vedas,
and we still do not wish to anticipate too much of our subsequent
findings, which vigorously call into question current thinking. Let us
simply note at this stage that it was the eminent German-born scholar
Max Müller, a professor at Oxford, who arbitrarily fixed the lower
limit to between 1200 B .c . and 1000 B .c . The sheer weight of his
formidable authority silenced other opinions. Yet, in his work The
Six System s o f Indian P hilosophy, published shortly before his death
in 1900, Müller made this significant admission:
W hatever th e Vedas m ay b e called, they are to us unique an d
priceless gu ides in opening before our ey es tom bs q f thought
richer in relics than the royal tom bs qfE gypt, an d m ore an
cien t an d prim itive in thought than the oldest hym ns q f Babylonian orA ccadian poets, ffw eg ra n t th at they belonged

sq fe ground, though we shou ld notforg et th at this is a con
stiu ctive d a te only, an d th at such a d ate d oes n ot becom e
p ositiv e by m ere repetition. 34
A few paragraphs later the aged Müller, seemingly having wea
ried of the whole chronological debate, observed:
W hatever m ay b e th e d ate q fth e Vedic hymns, w hether 1500
o r 1 5 ,0 0 0 B . c ., they h av e th eir own unique p la ce an d stan d

These telling remarks notwithstanding, and even in the face of
42 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION

all the counterevidence ava il
able today, Müller's earlier
dating of the Vedas has prov
en incredibly tenacious. How
ever, most scholars today
concede that th e .bulk o f the
Rig- Veda was written several
centuries earlier than Müller
would have it. The consen
sus of scholarly opinion hov
ers around the fictitious date
of 1500 B.c. Thus in the post

renowned Indologist A. L.
Basham expresses the ortho
dox view when he a ss igns
the four Vedas to the period
between 1500 B.c. and 9 0 0 B.c.3'1Our own view, which we will unfold
in the following chapters, is that there are stringent reasons for ac
cepting a much earlier date for the Rig- Veda and also for the three
other Vedic hymnodies.
In the next chapter, we will revisit one of the greatest follies of
Indology— the Aryan invasion theory—by which Müller and many
other scholars sought—and to some extent still seek to j usti fy their
comparatively recent dating of the Rig-V eda.

The A ryans: Exploding a Scientjftc Myth
The Ignoble O rigins o f th e A ryan M yth
WHEN ADOLF HITLER CAME TO POWER IN POST
Bismarck Germany, he coupled his nationalistic goals
with a powerful ideology that had a peculiar racial
twist. After World War I he joined the German Work
ers Party, which had been founded specifically to pro
mote nationalism, anti-Communism, anti-Semitism, and the supremacy
of the Aryan race. The Party was funded by the Thule Gesellschaft
(Thule Society), a secret organization founded in Munich in 1918 dedi
cated to occultism and the establishment of a pan-German state.'
The Thule Gesellschaft derived its name from the legendary is
land in the North Sea that occultists believe to have been a part of the
lost continent o f Atlantis. Thule was thought to have served as a
refuge for the fleeing Atlantean Aryans and as a point of origin for
all higher culture—an imaginative tale for which there is no material
evidence.
Among the Thulists were several high-placed politicians. After
taking over the leadership of the German Workers Party, Hitler used
Thulist ethnocentrism to create a mass political movement that would
give the German “master race" absolute supremacy in the world.
Occultism continued to play an important role in the Nazi party
to the end. Hitler seems to have believed that the Aryans originated
in Atlantis and that he was destined to restore the race to its original
purity and greatness. He wanted to breed a race of supermen. Heinrich



IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
Himmler, the leader o f the SS elite corps, especially dedicated himself
to this political ideal, primarily by seeking the extermination o f “in
ferior" races, thus venting Hitler's long-standing resentment against
the Jews.
Nazi racism was the ill-begotten child of philosopher Friedrich
Nietzsche's ideal of the superman (Ü berm ensch) and occult doctrines
o f adepts who supposedly inherited their secret knowledge from the
survivors of Atlantis, some o f whom had found refuge in the remote
areas of Mongolia and Tibet. German racist anthropologists described
the typical Atyan as blond and blue-eyed, with a robust physique
the Nordic type found in the Scandinavian countries rather than in
Bavaria where Nazism originated. This racist notion of “Aryan" rep
resents a complete perversion of the original meaning of this word.
A ryan: Language or R ace?
Whence did the Nazi occultists get their dangerous notion o f an
Aryan race? We know that one oftheir intellectual sources was Alfred
Rosenberg's Der M ythus des 2 0 . Jahrhun derts (The Myth of the 1\ven
tieth Century), which was something like a manifesto for the Nazi
ideologues. Another source was the journal O stara, which was the
official organ o f the Ariosophic movement. Rosenberg and the
Ariosophist writers, in turn, derived their racist and political doc
trines from more reputable scholars who were nonetheless wrong in
their historical appraisal o f the Aryans o f India. We will shortly ex
plain just how wrong they were.
First, however, we must note that the word “Aryan" stems from
the Sanskrit language and is the anglicized version of arya, meaning
“noble" or “cultured." This is how the people who transmitted the sa
cred heritage of the Vedas described themselves. Thus originally the
Sanskrit word a ry a did not refer to a particular race or language but to
a moral quality or mental disposition—that of nobility—uniting those
of like mind into a felt kinship with one another. Manu, the mythical
progenitor of humankind in the present world cycle, is said in the Vedic
texts to have given the area between the Himalayas and the Vindhya
Mountains the name arya-varta, meaning “abode of the noble folk.”



However, later the word ary a seems to have taken on secondary
meanings in India and also in ancient Persia— there being a close
connection between Vedic Sanskrit and the Iranian language. Thus,
in a cuneiform inscription from Old Persia, dating to 5 2 0 b .c., em
peror Darius declared: “I have made the writing o f a different sort in
Aryan, which did not exist before.” An entire book could be written
on how, from these simple original meanings, “Aryan” became what
J. P. Mallory called the “most loaded o f Indo-European words.”2 But
this is not our purpose here.
The word “Aryan” is thought to be cognate with “Iran” and also
with “Eire” (the old name of Ireland). What the Aryans of India, the
Iranians of Persia, and the Celts of Ireland have in common, first and
foremost, is their Indo-European language. That the languages spo
ken by these peoples are related was not known until the late eigh
teenth century. In 1 786 Sir William Jones, a British judge at the High
Court in Calcutta and one of the pioneer Sanskritists, noticed to his
great surprise that there are striking similarities in the vocabulary
and grammar of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Celtic, and Gothic.
The following table shows the striking resemblance between key

Jones’s discovery led to the creation of a whole new scholarly
discipline—comparative linguistics. This innovative discipline repre
sented a major departure from the orthodox understanding of the
Judeo-Christian heritage, which regarded Hebrew as the matrix of all
languages. According to the Bible, the human race began with Adam
and Eve, who were created by Yahweh shortly after He had fash
ioned the world. Following Bishop Ussher, the Christian authorities
favored a date of 4004 B.c. for the moment o f creation. Because hu
man beings were created on the sixth day of God’s creative endeavor,
humanity is practically as old as the Earth. Since the most direct
descendants of Adam and Eve were Semitic tribes, Hebrew was hailed
as the oldest language in the world.
This belief was undermined by the discoveries of comparative
linguistics. Jones and his school did for language what seventy-two
years later Charles Darwin did for biology when, together with Alfred
Russel Wallace, he presented his famous paper at the Linnaean Soci
ety on July 1, 1858. Both Jones’s and Darwin’s efforts freed impor



THE ARYANS: EXPLODING A SCIENTIFIC MYTH
tant aspects o f human life from religious dogma. Yet the tremendous
implications o f Darwin's and Wallace's joint paper seem to have com
pletely escaped their peers—a common experience for scientific pio
neers. It took another generation, after the publication of Darwin's
T heD escentqfM an ( 1872), before it was grasped that Darwin's work
attacked and effectively demolished the traditionalist notion that all
animal species had been created simultaneously and were immu
table. The human species, too, was portrayed as having undergone
many mutations, as a result of natural selection.
Jones's earlier discovery never achieved the popularity of Dar
winian evolutionism, but it too contributed to the growing gap be
tween religious dogma and scientific theory. Notably the German lin
guists Friedrich von Schlegel and Franz Bopp were instrumental in
developing this newly fledged branch of scholarship. For a long time,
prior to the emergence of prehistoric archaeology, the historical ex
planations proffered for the similarities between the various Indo
European languages were rather unsophisticated and highly specu
lative. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the idea that all Indo
European languages derive from a much older Proto-Indo-European
language gained momentum. Scholars endeavored to reconstruct not
only that protolanguage but also the culture associated with it. Most
importantly, they became preoccupied with identifying the original
homeland of that hypothetical culture.
In the late nineteenth century, these linguistic-cultural consider
ations began to be marred by racial overtones. The ubiquitous Max
Müller, who equated linguistic communities with ethnic groups, was
among those who naively succumbed to this scholarly racialism,
unsuspecting of its explosive potential. He wrote:
The Aryan nations, w ho pursued a northw esterly direction,
stand before us in history a s the principal nations q fn o rth
western A sia an d Europe. They have been the prom inent
actors in th e g rea t dram a q f history, an d h av e carried to

com e th e rulers efh istory , an d it seem s to b e their m ission to
link all parts e fth e world together by the chain s efav ilisatiotr
com m erce an d relireligion.3
In later years, when anti-Semitists were using arguments like
Müller's to bolster their virulent racism, the aged scholar, horrified at
the political developments, was anxious to revoke some of his earlier
careless pronouncements. In particular he debunked the concept of
an Aryan race, emphasizing that “Aryan" and “Semitic" were lin
guistic and not ethnic labels.
Even such a remarkable scholar as Gordon Childe fell under the
spell of this widespread racialism. In his classic work TheA ryans, he
sought to trace the expansion of the Aryan people from their sup
posed homeland throughout Europe and India. He avoided speaking
of an Aryan race but postulated a unified Aryan culture. He com
mented:
To w hatever p h y sical ra ce o r races they [th e A ryan s] b e longed, they m ust h a v e p ossessed a certain spiritu al unity
reflected in an d conditioned by th eir com m unity e f speech. To their linguistic h eirs th ey bequeathed, i f n ot skull-types

m ust h av e been g ifted with exception al m ental endowm ents,
i f n ot in enjoym ent e f a high m aterial culture. 4
Yet, to his own regret and lasting embarrassment, Childe allowed
himself, at the end of his book, to speak o f the Aryans’ “superiority
in physique" which “fitted them to be the vehicles of a superior lan
guage” and of their “superior strength to conquer even more ad
vanced peoples and so to impose their language on areas from which
their bodily type has almost completely vanished." Here we are clearly
presented not merely with the idea of a unified Aryan culture but, as
in Müller's case, its supposed racial characteristics.
50 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



Thus, sadly, scholarly racialism paved the way for fascist racism.
Once one believes that there is a culturally or even genetically supe
rior race, the inevitable next step will be to promote that race politi
cally to the detriment o f other races.
Apart from this serious flaw in Childe's book, it represented a
first major synthesis of Aryan research, bringing the weight of both
linguistics and archaeology to bear on the subject. Childe was well
qualified for this task because he had been trained both as a philolo
gist and an archaeologist.
Over the years, the linguistic models o f the Indo-European lan
guage community have been refined and new archaeological evi
dence has come to light. Today the work o f archaeologist Marija
Gimbutas, building on Childe's efforts, is widely respected.5 In her
books and articles, she has tried to reconstruct what she calls “the
pre-Indo-European culture o f Europe" or “the civilization o f Old
Europe," preceding the invasions o f the Proto-Indo-European com
munities from outside Europe, between 4 5 0 0 B.c. and 2 5 0 0 B.c. At
any rate, Gimbutas avoids the word “Aryan" and pays little atten
tion to linguistic issues, confining herself strictly to the archaeologi
cal evidence.
Not so the British archaeologist Colin Renfrew. In his controver
sial but fascinating study A rchaeology an d Language, he specifically
tackles, as the book's subtitle states, “the puzzle of Indo-European
origins. "0 He boldly challenges the reticence felt by most post-World
War II archaeologists to address linguistic problems. He argues
rather convincingly—that a proper appraisal o f both linguistic and
archaeological data actually yields an intriguing synthesis, giving us
a whole new picture of the Indo-Europeans.
Renfrew reiterates that “Aryan" or “Indo-European" refers to a
language, not a culture. Understandably, he rejects the still more er
roneous equation of language with race. Yet, when he and others
look for a homeland for the Indo-European-speaking tribes, this sepa
ration between language and culture begins to break down again.
But, perhaps, if scholars persist in associating Indo-European lan
guage with cultural characteristics, it is because language is an in
strument of culture. Thus, while we must not assume a one-on-one
THE ARYANS: EXPLODING A SCIENTIFIC MYTH ^ i 51



52 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
relationship between language and culture, we must also not make
the opposite error o f denying any relationship between them. Lan
guage and culture m ay coincide, and so m ay language and race. For
instance, the !Kung bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in southern Af
rica speak a unique language, have a unique culture, and represent a
specific racial group. But we must not a priori assume a one-on-one
linkage between language, culture, and race. Historical actuality tends
to be more complex than our theories permit, and in our theoretical
constructs we must allow for the fact that simplification may and
usually does lead to distortion. What definitely needs to be kept care
fully uncoupled is language/culture/race on the one hand and the
presumption o f racial superiority or inferiority on the other.

Ever since the discovery of the kinship between the various Indo
European languages, scholars have puzzled over the original homeland
of the Indo-European speakers. The similarities in their various lan
guages pointed to a common ancestral language, and divergences were
explained as the result of migrations from a shared place of origin.

Northern Europe (the Nazis' favorite), even the North Pole, Cen
tral Asia, southern Russia, India and lately Anatolia (modern Tur
key) have been proposed as likely candidates for that ancestral lan
guage. Most contemporary scholars believe that the original Indo
European speakers—or Proto-Indo-European speakers— were located
somewhere in the steppes o f southern Russia near the Caspian Sea.
From there they supposedly spread to Europe, the Middle East (nota
bly Iran), and India.
More recently, an excellent case has been made in favor o f east
ern Anatolia, which reverses the presumed migratory route: Now the
Indo-Europeans are thought to have spread out from the East to the
West. With this the myth o f the blond Aryan superman has been
safely put to rest, for the physical types o f Anatolia are more like the
Mediterranean type.
With regard to India, which is our present focus, the mainstream
model argues that the Vedic Aryans entered India from the north
west through the mountain passes ofAfghanistan. The picture painted
is o f barbaric seminomadic tribes in search of new grazing land for
their precious cattle. In their pursuit of wealth, so the stoty goes, the
blond and blue-eyed Aryans were as ruthless and merciless as the
later Huns, conquering and subduing the native population of the
Indian peninsula by the sword. Bloodthirsty and wild-eyed, they
maimed and killed their opponents, ransacked the villages and towns,
burned the fields, and devastated the gardens. In the process they
destroyed the existing political and economic order. In successive
waves over several centuries, they came pouring down from the
mountains on fast horses or, according to some far-fetched accounts,
in horse-drawn war chariots, surprising their enemies with showers
ofarrows. Hardened by their long travel across the steppes o f south
ern Russia and over the difficult mountain passes, the fierce, illiter
ate Aryans arrived in India lusting for war. The Aryans' innate ag
gressiveness, combined with a superior military technology o f iron
weapons and chariots, ensured their total victory over a population
that was unprepared for this onslaught. More than anything, the
Vedic Aryans coveted the cattle o f the native Indians, for personal
wealth was measured in the size of the herd a man owned.
THE ARYANS: EXPLODING A SCIENTIFIC MYTH ¡'M S3



Haughtily the Aryans looked down on the conquered enemy,
sneering at the snubnosed features and dark skin o f the native popu
lation. They also ridiculed and rejected the speech of the conquered
as barbaric, forcing them to learn their own Vedic Sanskrit. They
replaced the existing priesthood and its divine pantheon with their
own shamanic specialists and deities. The conquered were forced to
occupy the lowest rung—that of the shudras— in the Vedic social
hierarchy. They were reduced to performing those tasks that the
Aryans deemed too demeaning for themselves.
So goes the Aryan invasion theory. Our succinct portrayal o f it is
actually a composite o f the many versions o f this theory. Although
its defendants include many distinguished academics, the fact is that
this theory is little more than a scholarly myth—and a myth that has
proven incredibly hypnotic. Fortunately, scholars are beginning to
extricate themselves from its spell, largely because the evidence de
mands it.
The Aryan invasion is supposed to have occurred in the period
between 1500 b .c. and 1200 b .c. This date was proposed because of
certain epigraphic data from Asia Minor. Cuneiform clay tablets were
found in the Hittite capital o f Boghazkoy that record a treaty be
tween the Hittite king Subiluliuma and the Mitanni ruler Mattiwaza.
Whereas Hittite has been recognized as an Indo-European language,
Hurrian (the language spoken in the Mitanni kingdom) is neither
Indo-European nor Semitic. The treaty mentions the names Mi-it
tra-as-si-il, U-ru-w-na-as-si-il, In-da-ra, and Na-sa-at-ti-ia-an-na.
These have been identified as Mitanni versions ofth e divinities Mitra,
Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya (an alternative appellation of the Ashvins,
the celestial twins) in the Sanskrit language of the Aryans o f India. 7
How can this curious epigraphic fact be explained? Scholars have
generally assumed that the Mitanni ruling elite was made up o f Vedic
Aryans. However, another explanation is that the Mitanni had the
same deities as the Vedic Aryans because they came from a common
cultural background. The fact that these names sound so close to
Vedic Sanskrit also need not mean that the two linguistic groups
separated recently. We know that from earliest times there had been
a steady commercial traffic between India on the one side and the
54 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE ARYANS: EXPLODING A SCIENTIFIC MYTH { f t 55
Middle East and Anatolia on the other side.
Indo-European names also are found in Egyptian documents o f
the same period. Moreover, the elite of the Kassites, who ousted the
Semitic rulers o f Babylon about 16 0 0 B.c., bore lndo-European names
as well. Still earlier references to Indo-Europeans are found in the
Chagar Bazar tablets o f Samsi-Adad in northern Syria, which have
been dated to 1800 B .c . This evidence suggests that Indo-Europeans
were on the move in those days. But does this necessarily mean that
they were newcomers to Asia Minor?
According to Renfrew, the late arrival o f the Indo-Europeans in
Asia Minor and India is merely one possibility. He refers to it as
“Hypothesis B ,” which envisions the homeland o f the Indo-Europe
ans in the Eurasian steppes. His own preferred explanation, how
ever, is “Hypothesis A," which assumes the presence o f Proto-Indo
European dialects in central and eastern Anatolia as long as nine
thousand years ago. From there the Proto-Indo-European speakers
gradually extended their sphere o f linguistic and cultural influence
to Iran and northern India, as well as westward into Europe.
Renfrew considers the possibility that actual history .may be ex
plainable by a combination of both hypotheses: While Proto-Indo
European speakers may have been a prominent presence in Anatolia,
Iran, and northern India prior to the rise o f the great civilizations,
there also may have been later invasions o f the civilized areas by
Indo-European nomadic tribes.
At any rate, the same facts that allow us finally to retire the cen
tury-old model of the Aryan invasion into India also present us with an
exciting new picture of the ancient world, in which the Indic civilization
obviously played a crucial role. What is emerging, and not only in re
gard to India, is a world that was thoroughly imbued with sacred tradi
tions-traditions that have by and large been forgotten and ignored but
that contain vitally important insights into the human condition.
Clearly, the Aryan-speaking communities had to be located some
where on this planet. But on what grounds was their homeland placed
in Central Europe, as Gimbutas would have it, or in South Russia (or,
alternatively, Scandinavia), as Childe insisted, or in eastern Anatolia,
as Renfrew thinks? Why not, as one Indian savant seriously sug

gested, a t the North Pole? The reasons given are primarily linguistic
and cultural rather than archaeological. By comparing phonetic and
grammatical changes in diverse lndo-European languages, scholars
have invented a series of hypothetical steps, suggesting a certain
sequence among the languages involved. Moreover, reconstructing
the lost Proto-Indo-European mother language, they also hoped to
learn something from the reconstructed vocabulary. What kind of
social, cultural, and natural environment did it suggest?
The problem with such linguistic reconstructions is that they are
purely hypothetical. The meaning of reconstructed words in Proto
Indo-European is completely unprovable. For instance, the Proto
Indo-European word *reg (the convention of using an asterisk de
notes that the word is purely hypothetical) is thought to mean "ruler”
or "king.” It was artificially constructed by comparing such words as
Sanskrit rqjaa, Latin rex, Old Irish n , and Thracian rhesos. Yet, some
scholars have rightly objected that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may
not have had kings but tribal protectors with special charisma or
spiritual power. The reconstructed Proto-lndo-European vocabulary
is similarly controversial when it comes to description s of the natural
environment, such as plants and animals. J. P. Mallory critically sur
veyed the evidence and concluded the following:
!fw e try to draw th e environm ental evidence tog eth er. . . we a m v e a t a lan dscape w hich included som e trees and cer
tainly enough to p rov id eJorest environm entsJor a num ber

E uropeans exclusively in th e open steppe (an d n otJo r e s t
step p e or river valleys), or in a desert region, w ould seem to
be incongruous with the Proto-Indo-European vocabulary. 8
This is not really very much to go by, especially when we consider



that local ecosystems and climates are subject to variation over the
long time span in question. The British archaeologist Stuart Piggott
summarized the vagaries of linguistic comparisons very poignantly thus:
The m ethod h a s its d a n g ers-th e g reat Sanskrit sch olar

dence too literally one cou ld conclude th at th e origin al Indo

but not rain an d han ds!*
As we have shown, the era postulated for the original Indo
Europeans prior to the divergence into different languages has been
steadily pushed back. At first it was maintained that the split oc
curred about 1500 B.C. Now a more realistic date several thousand
years earlier is widely accepted.
Mallory, for instance, places the people who spoke Proto-Indo
European in the era from 4 5 0 0 b.c. to 2 5 0 0 B.c. Thereafter their lan
guage became fragmented into dialects (known as the various Indo
European languages). The cause o f this linguistic divergence is said
to have been the exodus of the Proto-Indo-Europeans from their origi
nal homeland over many centuries. The Aryans who allegedly moved
into India in the second millennium B.c. belonged to a late wave of
Indo-Europcan migran ts.
Other scholars have suggested that the Indo-European language
dates back to the Stone Age! 10 Renfrew’s much-debated argument is
that the original Indo-European speakers lived in Anatolia and from
there introduced agriculture to the rest o f Europe around 6 0 0 0 B.c. or
somewhat earlier. According to him, immigrant farmers brought the
new art. By perhaps as early as 3 0 0 0 B.c., Indo-European was spo
ken throughout Europe, with pockets of non-Indo-European speak
ers (including languages like Basque, Etruscan, and Iberian).
Archaeological evidence does not seem to support completely
Renfrew’s immigrant agriculturalist model, but at least it seems a
step in the right direction. At any rate, it is quite likely that Europe
adopted agriculture far more slowly than Renfrew assumed, possibly
stretching over several millennia. 11
THE ARYANS: EXPLODING A SCIENTIFIC MYTH $ 57



A ryan P atriarch al Culture and the M atriarch al C u ltu res o f “Old E u ro p e”
Renfrew's ideas run counter to Gimbutas’s model, which has had
a certain popular appeal among contemporary paganists and God
dess worshipers. In Gimbutas's reconstruction of history, “Old Eu
rope" prior to 4 500 B.c. was exclusively inhabited by people who
spoke non-Indo-European languages and had a culture that was
“matrifocal and probably matrilinear, agricultural and sedentary, egali
tarian and peaceful."12 The worship of the Mother Creatrix in her
various forms was at the center of the worldview of those pre-Indo
Europeans.
After that golden era, Indo-European invaders from the steppes
of Russia invaded Europe in three major waves between 4 5 0 0 and
2500 B.c. Gimbutas characterized the intruding culture as “patriar
chal, stratified, pastoral, mobile, and war-oriented."13 She called these
invaders Kurgans— from kurgan meaning “barrow" in R u ssian -b e
cause they buried their dead in round barrows.
Gimbutas believes that when the Indo-European invaders largely
replaced the Goddesses of Old Europe with male divinities, they ef
fectively interrupted a continuous cultural tradition that had its roots
in the Upper Paleolithic twenty thousand years earlier. As a result of
these violent Indo-European invasions, the traditions of Old Europe
and the Indo-Europeans became inextricably mingled, with the latter
dominating the former. As Gimbutas observed:
We a re still living under th e sw ay o f th a t aggressive m ale
invasion and only beginning to discover our long alienation
fr o m our authen tic European H etita g e-g y la n ic, nonviolent,
earth-cen tered culture and its sym bolic language, w hose ves
tiges rem ain en m eshed in our own system o/sy m bols. H
Gimbutas's model has not remained unopposed. Invasions are
difficult to prove on the basis of archaeological artifacts alone. It is
quite possible that Proto-Indo-Europeans entered Europe long be
fore the first Kurgan wave of invaders. Renfrew argued that “a change
in iconography does not necessarily betoken a profound change in
58 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE ARYANS: EXPLODING A SCIENTIFIC MYTH
the underlying belief system" and also that “a change in belief sys
tem in no way need correlate with a change in language.” I? He cited
the example of the Myceneans who have at times been regarded by
Gimbutas as descendants of the gylanic belief system of Old Europe
but who spoke an Indo-European language. In other words, while
Gimbutas’s Kurgans may well have been Indo-Europeans, this does
not mean that the societies of Old Europe were inevitably non-Indo
European.
It is perfectly feasible that Old Europe, as Gimbutas uses the
term, was a mixture o f languages and cultures before the arrival of
the Kurgans. That is to say, to contrast a matrifocal, egalitarian,
and peace-loving Old European culture with a patriarchal, strati
fied, and war-mongering Indo-European culture may be too much
of a stereotype.
In looking back into the remote past we have to be prepared to
live with a certain degree of uncertainty. Many things will never be
known for sure. Others will be misinterpreted and perhaps corrected
later on. In a way, all historical reconstruction is simplification, and
all we can do is be on our guard against gross oversimplification.
Following this excursion into the dimly lit world o f the Indo
Europeans and Proto-Indo-Europeans, we next turn to one of the
most exciting archaeological discoveries of this century. It brought to
light an astonishing civilization— the so-called Indus civilization
that at least for a while seemed to neatly confirm the Aryan invasion
theoty. But only for a while . . .

An A rchaeological Surprise: The Cities
o f the Indus Valley
How th e Indus C ities W ere D iscovered
THE LARGE MOUNDS OF HARAPPA JN WHAT JS NOW
Pakistan had long been known as concealing the
ruins of an old town. What was not understood was
that these hidden ruins represented one o fth e most
advanced and important cities of antiquity. As early
as 1826, Charles Masson reported on this site, wh ich is located at
the river Ravi, a tributary of the Indus in the north of Pakistan.
However, its true importance was not apprec iated until, in 1921, the
Indian archaeologist Daya Ram Sahni conjectured it might belong
to the pre-Mauryan era. The Maurya empire was established at the
time of Alexander the Great’s invasion of India. Candragupta, the
first Maurya emperor, us urped the throne of Magadha in 3 2 0 B .c .
As archaeologist s were to discover, Harappa was far older than a ny
one might have guessed, preceding Candragupta by tw o-and-a-half
millennia.
A year after Daya Ram Sahni's conj ecture, R. D. Banerji opened a
trench in Mohenjo-Daro four hundred miles to the south, and what
he saw compelled him to suggest that these ruins were related to the
Harappa site. Experts working on Mesopotamian antiquities pointed
out connections with finds from that area which went back to the
third or fourth millennium B.c. Mohenjo-Daro is located on the right

bank of the Indus River nearly two hundred miles north-east of
Karachi, which is at the Arabian Sea. Excavations at Mohenjo-Daro,
which perhaps means “hill o f the dead,” started in 1922 under Sir
John Marshall and continued until 1931. After the partition of India
and Pakistan in 194 7. further archaeological work was conducted by
Sir Mortimer Wheeler.
The Harappa site was in a poor state when archaeologists finally
began to excavate it seriously. When the Lahore-Multan railway line
was built, engineers had mined the ancient bricks to lay the one
hundred-mile-long roadbed. What invaluable evidence was destroyed
in that plundering for progress will never be known.
Since the archaeological discovery of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro,
hundreds of other sites have been discovered. These include major
sites at Ganweriwala, Kakhigarhi, Dholavira, Kalibangan, and Lothal,
the first three comparable in size to Mohenjo-Daro. The Harappan
world appears to have covered an area of around 3 0 0 ,0 0 0 square
miles, stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the Godavari
River in modern Karnataka in the south, and from the Indus River
valleys in the west to the plains of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers in
the east. Additional sites have been found in Afghanistan to the Amu
Darya River, thus bringing part o f the Iranian world into the Harappan
cultural field. A recent count has identified over 2 ,5 0 0 settlements
belonging to various periods. Most of the sites are situated on the
eastern side of the greater Indus plain. This plain, which is now mostly
desert, was formerly watered by several rivers, including a river that
was larger than the Indus—a fact that, as we will show, has crucial
bearing for our understanding of ancient India.
The Harappan culture area— some scholars even speak of an
empire— by far exceeds in size the combined area occupied by the
Sumerian and Egyptian civilizations. It also is more than twice the
size of the already huge area claimed for the Maya civilization in the
early post-Christian Era. The enormous size of the early Indic civili
zation was not merely because of northwestern India’s fertile soil
around the rivers but also because of the age o f that civilization and
its correspondingly large population. As we will show, it can be traced
much farther back than the two great cities of Harappa and Mohenjo

Daro. Rather, these thriving urban centers seem to be the final flow
ering of.a civilization with a protracted history that began, as far as
we know, with the town o f Mehrgarh. We say more about this early
Neolithic settlement in Chapter 8 and show the lines of development
from there to the world o f Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
T h e G olden A ge o f H arapp a
The ancient Indic civilization, commonly though misleadingly
referred to as the Indus civilization, is now widely thought to have
reached maturity during the period from 2 7 0 0 B.c. to 1900 b.c .. gen
erally called the Harappan Age. In 1931, Sir John Marshall had pro
posed the period from 3 1 0 0 b.c. to 2 7 5 0 s.c. as the golden age of
Harappa. Thirty years later this date was modified by Sir Mortimer
Wheeler to 2 5 0 0 s.c. to 1500 b.c. Other scholars have fixed the be
ginnings to 2 8 0 0 B.c. and the terminal date to 1800 s.c. More and
more the consensus moves toward 1900 b .c. as the date for the con
clusion of the flowering of the great cities. However, their begin
nings are still shrouded in darkness.
In any case, during the span of nearly one millennium, the land
scape of northwestern India was dotted with numerous villages and
towns, as well as several large urban centers. Archaeologists have
furnished various counts for these settlements. In 1968, only around
one hundred sites were known. Today some counts go as high as
2,500, and the number is likely to increase further, perhaps dramati
cally. Of course, these did not all exist at the same time, though many
will undoubtedly have coexisted for many generations.
The settlements of the far-flung early Indic civilization, like most
ancient civilizations, all lay at or near rivers. The two best-excavated
towns to date are Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. Both show a striking
similarity o f design. Both sites, which are roughly three miles in di
ameter, were geometrically arranged into a grid pattern. In both towns,
to the west lies a “citadel,” some 400 by 200 yards in extent and
erected on a high platform constructed of mud and brick and de
fended by crenelated walls. One of the most remarkable structures of
the citadel at Mohenjo-Daro is the Great Bath, which is thirty-nine



IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
feet long, twenty-three feet wide, and eight feet deep. It is sunk into
the paving of a courtyard and water-proofed with bitumen; it is ap
proachable from the north and the south by brick steps with possible
wooden stair treads. The floor of the bath slopes to an outlet that
leads in turn to an arched drain deep enough for an adult to stand
upright.
Just north of the pool, archaeologists discovered eight small bath
rooms drained by small outlets in the floor. Each bathroom has its
own staircase leading to the second story. If the whole complex served
a purpose similar to the tanks of the later Hindu temples, we may
assume that the second story had cells for the priests and that the
baths were designed for their daily ritual ablutions.
To the east o f this settlement area lies the lower city with straight
unpaved streets, some of them thirty feet wide. The streets have brick

lined sewers fitted with manholes for easy access. Only the Romans,
more than two thousand years later, had a comparable drainage sys
tem. The streets divide the city into large blocks, and the blocks in
turn are served by narrow curving lanes. The lower city appears to
have been the residence
o f the common people
merchants, artisans, and
laborers.
The houses, which
are often two or more
stories high, are built
of standardized baked
bricks. Each house has
several rooms, arranged
around a square court
yard. Brick staircases lead
to upper floors or flat
rooftops. Better appointed
houses have bathrooms,
which are connected by
drains to the sewers un
der the main streets. The
design of the bathrooms
suggests that the early In
dians cleaned themselves

by pouring water over their heads from pitchers—as do their descen
dants in modern India. The narrow windows, which are placed high
on the buildings, are screened with grilles of terra-cotta or alabaster.
In many cases, the doors open onto side lanes. This architecture is
reminiscent of a traditional Punjabi town in contemporary Pakistan
and India.
The largest building uncovered at Mohenjo-Daro, which is 2 3 0
feet long and 78 feet wide and includes the Great Bath, has been
identified as a palace, governmental administrative center, or a priestly
college. Perhaps it served all these functions, as appears to have been
the case o f the great architectural complexes o f Minoan Crete. As
Nanno Marinatos argued convincingly in her important monograph
M inoan R eligion, the monumental buildings of Crete at Knossos,
Phaistos, Malia, and Zakros were in all probability not, as widely
assumed, royal palaces but ritual centers. She writes:

Marinatos's remarks apply with surprising poignancy also to the
Indian situation. Altho ugh the Minoan temples were all constructed
in the period from 1900 b.c. to 1450 B.c., her elegant solution to the
Minoan riddle may well provide an answer to the question of the
nature and purpose of the much older architectural complexes of
Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, and other towns.
At the Harappa site a building twice the size of the sacred com
plex at Mohenjo-Daro was found, and archaeo logists have identi
fied it as a granary. Granaries and storage areas also have been
found at the so-called palaces of Minoan Crete and have been taken
to indicate the control of food surplus by the priestly elite. As
Marinatos sugge sted, th is s urplus could have been used for feast
ing, as a relief during famine, or in payment o f labor rendered to the
temple complex.
The site of Dholavira, where excavations have begun recently,
has yielded a town plan that is somewhat different from other major
sites. An interesting architectural feature here is the use of polished
stone pillars. New inscriptions also have been discovered, which in
clude a large wooden board inscribed with Indus signs.3 The large
towns of Rakhigarh i and Ganweriwala are still unexcavated and may
well contain further intrigu ing art ifacts.

been dug up. Most o f the finds are roughly modeled terra-cotta figu

The abundance of artistic artifacts
in the case of Egypt has no parallel
anywhere in the ancient world. No
tombs filled with splendid treasures
like the burial chamber of Tutan
khamen have been found in India.
Nor have Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro,
or any of the other sites surprised
archaeologists with colorful murals,
inscribed steles, or richly decked
coffins. The tropical Indian climate
has not been kind to whatever ob
jects the early settlers might have
left behind in their houses, public
buildings, or graves. However, we
must consider that archaeologists

THE CITIES OF THE INDUS VALLEY
have excavated only a fraction of the known sites, which may yet
yield invaluable treasures from the past.
So far the digs in India have produced at least three striking pieces
of art, which demonstrate the tremendous sophistication in sculpt
ing attained at that early time. The first artifact, made out of soap
stone (steatite), is a sculpture of a man who is some kind of offi
cial—perhaps a priest or overseer. He is bearded, with eyes half
closed, looking rather stern or
meditatively withdrawn. He has
a headband and a similarly styled
ornament on his upper left arm.
The garment draped over his left
shoulder is decorated with a large
trefoil pattern.
The second remarkable ob
ject is a male torso, fashioned out
of red sandstone, that in its bal
anced lines compares with the
beautiful art of Gandhara two
thousand years later.
The third artifact is a small
copper figurine that scholars
have labeled the “Dancing Girl."
The figure depicts a young nude
female, standing with a slight
arching of the hips. She is prob
ably a prostitute, either of the
worldly or the sacred variety.
Prostitutes, who offered their ser
vices at the temples or in the streets, were a regular feature of social
life in Mesopotamia. Temple dancers were, at certain times, also a
part oflater Indic (Hindu) society. The girls were dedicated at a young
age to serve the Gods through their art, and were known as deva
dasis, or “servants of God." It is not known whether this sacred insti
tution actually existed in Harappa and other early Indic towns. How
ever, temple prostitution was widespread in other early civilizations,

and we can reasonably expect its presence also in the early Indic civi
lization. What is certain, though, is that dancing and music were an
integral part of the urban life in ancient India. In any event, the dancer’s
pose prefigures later Indic representations of females.
The excavations also yielded a number of naturalistic miniature
sculptures of monkeys, squirrels, and other animals that were used
as pinheads or beads. In addi
tion, the artifacts include a num
ber of terra-cotta objects that
were clearly toys, such as carts,
bird-shaped whistles, and mon
keys that could slide down a
string.
The copper and bronze im
plements lag behind their Su
merian counterparts in crafts
manship. Perhaps further finds
will correct this impression, as
certainly the Harappans were
skilled metal workers. They
even invented the first carpen
ter’s saw with undulating teeth,
which allowed an easier cut,
since the sawdust could escape
more freely.
We must mention here a
controversial artifact that has
been carbon-dated to the fourth
millennium B .c . This is a life
sized bronze head, which has
been imaginatively identified as
a representation of the sage
Vasishtha, who figures promi
nently in the Vedas.* The iden
tification was based on the hair
style of the statue, which the

the Vedas describe as having been unique to the family of Vasish
tha. The hair is oiled and coiled with a tuft on the right. Vasishtha
was chief priest of King Sudas, who defeated a coalition of ten kings
in battles on the banks
of the Parushni (mod
em Ravi) and Yamuna
Rivers, which mark the
region of the Sarasvati
River between them.
Unfortunately, the
Hicks Foundation for
Cultural Preservation in
San Francisco, the pre
sent owners, acquired
the head from a dealer
in India and so nothing
is known about its ar
chaeological context.
The carbon-14 tests
were performed on the
deposits from inside
the hollow head, and
thus there can be no
absolute certainty
about the metal casting
itself. Metallurgical tests apparently indicate a similar age. The car
bon date given was 3 7 0 0 B .c ., with an error of up to eight hundred
years in either direction. However, a strikingly similar head from
Maharashtra, housed in the Heras Institute in Bombay, seems to be
long to a relatively recent time, perhaps 1200 a .d . to 1400 a .d .
The excavations in India have been particularly rewarding in the
number of recovered stamp seals. Thousands of them have been
found, and they are mostly o f square or rectangular shape in con
trast to the round seals at the much older town o f Mehrgarh, which
we will introduce shortly. Many have animal motifs, though some
depict humans. Not a few carry glyphs of the neatly designed Indus

script. The animals realistically depicted on the seals include the
humped bull, water buffalo, goat, tiger, rhinoceros, and elephant.
One seal in particular has stirred the imagination of scholars. It
has been dubbed the p ash u p ati seal, after the Hindu God Shiva,
who is characterized as the “Lord of the B easts,” pashu meaning
“beast” and p a ti meaning “lord." This seal shows a seated figure
with horned headgear, surrounded by an elephant (facing the oppo
site direction from the other animals), a rhinoceros, a buffalo, and a
tiger. Beneath his thronelike
seatare a pair of antelopes. The
figure’s face is masklike and
could be that of a buffalo. What
has often been interpreted as
an erect phallus could be part
of the belt. On the chest are ei
ther ornaments or, more likely,
painted marks reminiscent of
the kind of sectarian signs dis
played on the foreheads and
chests of holy men, or sadhus,
in later Hinduism.
There is a fascinating side
to these seals, which sheds
light on the historical signifi
cance of the early Indic civili
zation. For, typical Harappan
seals have been found far afield in Oman, Mesopotamia, and the
Maldives. These finds bear witness to the enthusiastic initiative of
the early Indic peoples as seafaring merchants. More will be said
about this in Chapter 6 in connection with our discussion o f the
picture a s it emerges from a careful reading o f what Gorden Childe
called the “priceless document" o f the R ig-V eda.5
Inland, the Harappans (as the early Indic people have been called
collectively) moved their goods using wheeled carts, camels, and river
boats. Their products would have included fine pottery wares, jew
elry (especially beads fashioned from a variety o f materials), copper

and bronze vessels, and not least woven cotton goods. The variety
and extent of their trade suggests that credit-keeping and calcula
tions were very important to the Harappans.
Weights found at Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, and other sites have
revealed a remarkable accuracy. The weights, which are uninscribed,
follow a binary-decimal system: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, up to 1 2,800
units, one unit weighing approximately 0.85 grams. Thus some of
the weights are so tiny that they could have been used by jewelers to
measure gold; others are so
enormous that they must have
been hoisted by ropes.
Measurements were princi
pally based on a decimal sys
tem, reminding one o f the fact
that the decimal numerals we
use today came from India. In
M ohenjo-Daro a scale was
found that is divided into pre
cise units of 0.264 inches. The
“foot” measured 13.2 inches
(equalling 5 0 x 0 .2 6 4 ). From
Harappa a m easuring rod is
known that shows units of
0 .3 6 7 inches, which suggests
that the early Indic peoples
knew more than one system o f
measurement. The second system was apparently that of the
“cubit” (of 2 0 .7 inches) found also in Egypt, Babylonia, and else
where. The buildings o f Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were all laid
out in cubits.
All this suggests that the Indic peoples were skilled in arithmetic
and presumably also geometry. The scientific knowledge of Neolithic
humanity has been systematically underrated by scholars, who sim
ply failed to see that the ancients used arithmetic and astronomy in a
ritual context and that ritualism and scientific knowledge are not
inherently opposed to each other. Very probably, science started out

as the special domain o f knowledge o f the priestly elite, which, in
order to ensure the preservation o f the moral order, had to be able to
read the language of the divinities inscribed in the regularities of the
starry firmament.
Largely based on the meticulous geometric layout of the towns
and the carefully maintained weights and measures over a large area,
many scholars have expressed the view that the so-called Indus civi
lization was rigidly governed by a sacerdotal elite. Certainly the overall
impression one gets is one of conservatism, which prompted the Brit
ish scholar Stuart Piggott to pass this harsh judgment:
The d ead h an d e f conservatism in design, rather than in
technique, lies heavily on all th e H arappa products. Complex
technicalprocesses were known, but the output sefered from
stan dardization an d an alm ost pu ritan ical utilitarianism . 6

From our point of view, the uni
formity pointed out by Piggott, which
recent finds show was not as com
plete as he had thought, is striking
rather than “repellent," as he put it.
It indeed suggests central organiza
tion and traditionalism. It could even
be that the very traditionalism of this
civilization prevented the preserva
tion of many artifacts, since the
Harappans, like the modem Hindus,
probably passed on their sacred ob
jects rather than leave them in graves.
In that case they might have disposed
of them only after they were broken
and no longer useable. It is also in
teresting to note that the Harappans
practiced cremation, as do the later
Hindus as a general rule.
Archaeologists and historians
have proffered all kinds of specula



THE CITIES OF THE INDUS VALLEY
tions about the social, economic, and political structure o f the so
called Indus civilization. Most of their ideas have so far remained
pure speculation and for the most part are not based on the new
evidence presented in this book. In light o f the remarkable continu
ity between the so-called Indus civilization and later Hindu civiliza
tion, we may reasonably assume that the people of the early Indic
civilization were guided by a priestly elite, as happened elsewhere in
the ancient world. It is likely that there were leaders among the priests
who enjoyed greater charismatic power than others but that on the
whole the control by the priestly estate was neither total nor rigid.
We also do not have to assume the existence o f a caste system,
which appears to have been the product of a much later age. We may,
however, reasonably postulate a social stratification into a priestly
elite, warrior estate, and general populace—in keeping with what we
know from other early civilizations and corresponding to the Vedic
division into brahmins, kshatriyas, and vaishyas. In addition, the
early lndic society might well have included a servile estate, corre
sponding to the Vedic shudra class.
Remarkably, war technology is not well represented in the ar
chaeological artifacts, and there is no evidence o fan y extensive mili
tary conflict, which is also true of Sumer for the period priorto around
2 0 0 0 B.c. The early Indic civilization appears to have been largely
peace-loving. As Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, a professor of anthropol
ogy at the University of Wisconsin, observed:
E p is o d e s q f a g g r e s s io n a n d c o lJ flic t p r o b a b ly o c c u r r e d , b u t

th ro u g h m ilita r y c o e r c io n . '
If not the might of the sword, what held this expansive urban
civilization together? We would probably be not far off the truth to
assume that cohesiveness was achieved by a shared religious
worldview according to which everything had its proper place and
station in life. Rebellion and revolution were not a part o f traditional
societies, as they seem to be of our own modern societies. Unless the
ruling elite squashed the people by prolonged unreasonable demands,



IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
everyone bore the burdens of life in silence. The pronounced ten
dency of accepting the established order was tied in with the reign
ing cosmology according to which the social order was divinely ap
pointed or a mirror image of the heavenly harmony.
What has seldom been properly appreciated is the strong possi
bility that the early Indic society, like the Hindu culture to which it
has given rise, was complex and diversified, allowing for regional
variations.8 After all, this pioneering civilization extended over an
area that, as noted above, has been estimated at around 3 0 0,000
square miles. This is an area bigger than the size of the state of
Texas or the African Republic of Zambia. By comparison, early phara
onic Egypt, despite its length of 5 7 0 miles, is estimated at having
comprised an area of under 13,000 square miles. Even when the
1000 miles between the first cataract of the Nile and Khartoum are
included, the area would still be under 15,000 square miles because
the desert formed an absolute boundary. Sumer, which the school
books continue to hail as the cradle of civilization, was even smaller.
Thus, in the early Indic civilization we are confronting the most
populous and geographically expansive culture of the third millen
nium B.c.—a formidable generator of ideas and skills. In subsequent
chapters we will reveal just how unique were the knowledge and
achievements of that early civilization. But first we will investigate
the terrible fate that seems to have stricken cities like Mohenjo-Daro
and Harappa.

of thirty-e ight individuals in contexts suggesti ng violence. Four in

apparently trying to climb the stairs to the street when they were
killed.
In another house, thirteen adults and a single child were found.
One of the skulls bore a long cut that could have been made by a
sword. Another skull showed similar marks of violence. Five more
skeletons—three men, two women, and a child— were found sprawl
ing amidst the bricks of a collapsed wall, ash, and broken pottery. In
a lane, six more skeletons—including that o f a child— were found,
but archaeologists have yet to provide a description. The same is
true of a single skeleton dug up in another street.
A group of nine skeletal remains— including those of five chil
dren— was found under a mound o f debris. Archaeologists have sug
gested that they were hastily buried. They also speculated that this

toward the Dasus or Dasyus, whom scholars identified with the
Harappans. They completely ignored, however, contradictory refer
ences to the Vedic people as builders of cities, as agriculturalists, and
as fighting intertribal battles rather than wars against indigenous
non-Indo-European peoples. They also overlooked the fact that the
epithet “conqueror o f cities" is widely applied to overlords o f fully
sedentary communities in other parts of the ancient world. We must
not limit it to nomadic rulers.
Most importantly, those subscribing to the Aryan invasion theory
were hard-pressed to match the dating for the invasion ( 1 5 0 0 B . c .
to 1200 B.c.) with the archaeologically established chronology o f
the cities. Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had been in decline or were
abandoned many centuries prior to the alleged intrusion o f nomadic
Aryans. Reluctant to discard their pet theory, scholars now pushed
the' time for the invasion back to coincide with the destruction o f
the cities.
Clearly, something happened to bring this great civilization to its
knees, but it was not any brutal invasion by nomads from the north
west. The catastrophe that befell the people of the Indus cities was of
an entirely different order and far more devastating than any pillag
ing tribes could ever be. As we will show, the cities and their inhab
itants succumbed to unpredictable Nature herself in a catastrophe of
gargantuan proportions.
The L esson o f C atastrophes
In our own era, Nature has bared its bloody tooth on more than
one occasion. However, mythmaking in the grand, archetypal style
of our ancestors is no longer an art form with us. Otherwise, some
more recent natural disasters might have been fixed in the collective
memoty by the creation of vivid, full-blooded myths. It would seem
that our mythologizing propensities do not serve the purpose of mak
ing the sacred more visible but that of concealing truth and gaining
power or advantage over others, as is overwhelmingly demonstrated
in contemporary politics and corporate business. Besides, we tend to
forget Nature's escapades very quickly, unless we ourselves were



among the victims or suffered loss from them. Our protected urban
lifestyle has thoroughly alienated us from Nature, and we know noth
ing of its rhythms and raw energy. When Nature intrudes into our
lives, we tend to react by denial, which is most apparent in the way
we deal with death.
Even though natural catastrophes have in modern times been far
less severe in magnitude than the cataclysms that spasmed the Earth
and terrorized humankind in prehistory, they can still have a
planetwide effect, altering climate and vegetation. Modern Western
society has so far managed to absorb these upheavals without too
much trouble. Government agencies and insurance companies take
care of immediate needs, collapsed houses are rebuilt within a year
or so, and soon life and business continue as usual.
Thus few of us remember the eruption of the volcano on the
Indonesian island ofKrakatau in 1883, which caused a tsunami that
traveled as far as England. We certainly tell our children no stories
about it. It happened to “someone else." An even more powerful erup
tion occurred sixty-eight years earlier on the Indonesian island of
Sumbawa when the Tambora volcano exploded. No universal leg
ends are woven around that event either.
Yet these disasters contain an important lesson for all of us. The
Earth is a living, breathing organism, and the thin skin of land that
protects us from its hot interior is rather flexible and porous. There
are constant seaquakes and earthquakes around the world, which
cause tidal waves and floods. Numerous volcanoes above ground and
in the depths of the world's oceans erupt periodically. The continents
are floating on giant plates around the globe, and where these plates
rub against each other, much activity—as yet barely understood
constantly endangers human civilization. Moreover, the gaseous
mantle that keeps our lungs filled with air is prone to tornadoes, hur
ricanes, and blizzards, which can cause considerable destruction.
Nevertheless, according to orthodox scientific opinion, the
progress ofhuman civilization has been ensured by a relatively stable
environment: All the great geological upheavals belong to the time of
pre-sapiens history. Since the ice sheet receded from Eurasia and
North America eleven thousand or so years ago, Nature has shown
8 0 (f) IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



humankind a rather benign face. The story goes that, apart from
occasional hiccups in the form of rather localized earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions, Nature has thrown no big tantrums in civilized
history. This scientific assumption is just that—an assumption, a
belief that is not borne out by the facts.
In pointing out this flimsy scientific credo, we must remember
that, before anything else, scientists are human beings and therefore
they are liable to making the same errors and entertaining the same
prejudices as any other human beings. This comes as a surprise only
to those who think that the scientific ideal of objectivity is a reality
rather than an ideal to be aspired to by scientists. In practice, scien
tific research frequently falls far short of the demanding standards of
objectivity. Indeed, philosophers of science have raised serious ques
tions about whether perfect objectivity is possible in principle. Bertrand
Russell, one of the great philosophers and mathematicians o f our
time, noted:
H u m an b e in g s c a n n o t, e f c o u rs e, w h o lly tr a n s c e n d h u m a n
n a tu r e; s o m e th in g s u b je c tiv e , ffo n ly t h e in te r e s t t h a t d e te r
m in es th e d ir e c tio n e f o u r a tte n tio n , m u s t r e m a in in a ll o u r
th o u g h t.2
No doubt with an eye on his own discipline, the renowned Brit
ish historian Arnold Toynbee said much the same when he observed,
“There are many angles of vision from which human minds peer at
the universe. "3 Thus when we look into the past we always look at it
through the lens of the present, inevitably distorting what we see.
As we become more aware of the distorting properties of our particu
lar lens, we can begin to retract some of our projections and miscon
ceptions about the past.
According to a minority opinion, human civilization has not been
spared large-scale natural catastrophes. On the contrary, this small
dissenting voice asserts, Nature's cataclysmic changes have shaped
much of early culture and thought— leading to the creation o f astro
nomical/astrological and calendrical/divinatoty sciences at an early
phase in the history of civilization. Our Neolithic (and possibly late
Paleolithic) ancestors were anxious to predict the volatile behavior
CATASTROPHE AND RECONSTRUCTION (:!) 81



o f our planet. They kept careful and remarkably accurate records of
the motion of the luminaries in the sky, because they felt that there
is a connection between the events in the celestial vault and the events
on Earth. As the esoteric maxim ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus
states: As above, so below.
Besides, now and a g a in -fa r more frequently than scholars like
to adm it-travellers from the heavens streaked across the sky and
slammed into the body of our planet as if it were made of gelatin.
The shock waves always devastated large areas and certainly did not
bypass populated cities. Perhaps this is why, around the time ofJesus'
birth, the astronomers/astrologers watched the sky with apprehen
sion. For we now know that they were witnesses to a rare super
nova. Our own sky watchers caused moderate excitement in the news
media when they reported the close passage of the minor planet
Hermes in 1937 (half a mile in diameter) and of a large asteroid
labeled 1989FC fifty-two years la te r-b o th passing at a distance of
little more than twice the distance to the Moon.
We know that climatic spikes occurred at around 8000 B.c., 6000
B .c., 3 1 0 0 B.c., and 1100 B.c. Temperatures also were unusually low
during the “Little Ice Age" period from 1200 a.d. to 1800 a.d. Tree
ring analysis revealed that 536 B.c. started a fifteen-year decline in
tree growth, which has been associated with a meteorite impact. Ac
cording to the statistical analysis of British astronomers Victor Clube
and Bill Napier, during the past five thousand years there were sev
eral dozen collisions with meteorites weighing tens of thousands of
tons and several collisions in the 100- to 1,000-m egaton range.4
Especially the large meteorites would have interrupted civilized life
for a period of time. If we have no written records o f these traumatic
events, it is largely because our knowledge of the past is tantaliz
ingly fragmentaty. We do, however, have scribal testimony of other
natural disasters of gargantuan proportions, as we will explain shortly.
T h e Flood an d O ther Rem em bered C atastrop h es
Apparently all the sacred literatures o f the world remember a
catastrop he-the Great Flood -that, long ago, wiped out most of civi

CATASTROPHE AND RECONSTRUCTION (f) 83
lized humanity. It is conceivable, though not very likely, that the
stoty of the deluge originally recorded a relatively local disaster which
then was disseminated from culture to culture through the flourish
ing oceanic interconnections that existed at a very early date. It is
also conceivable that memories of several or many large local disas
ters contributed to the universal flood legend. Let us also take into
account the fact that even a comparatively minor disaster claiming
human lives looks like a major catastrophe to those involved and is
likely to be remembered as such for a long time, especially in cul
tures relying primarily on the oral transmission o f knowledge.
All this is not to say that the story of the Great Flood may not
refer to an actual dramatic superevent in remembered history. There
have been large-scale catastrophes in historical times that changed
the destiny of whole cultures, which demonstrate that our planet is
far 'less stable than many geologists would have us believe.
For instance, about 1250 B.c. extensive flooding seems to have
occurred in Anatolia (modern Turkey), burying the Bronze Age city
of Tiryns. About the same time an earthquake destroyed the rich
merchant city of Troy (archaeological level VI). It is quite likely that
the two events were connected.
Three hundred and seventy-eight years earlier (according to tree
ring analysis validated by radiocarbon dating), the volcano on the
small Greek island of Santorini (Thera) blew up and triggered earth
quakes and a tsunami that devastated large areas of land not only on
mainland Greece but across the Mediterranean in Egypt and Pales
tine. This catastrophe brought down the fine Minoan civilization,
centering on the large island of Crete. Dwellings, temples, and “pal
aces" were destroyed by fire, ash, or flooding. The resulting social,
economic, and political chaos appears to have been exploited by ruth
less kings from mainland Greece, who seized the opportunity to deal
the deathblow to the Minoan civilization. Although the death was
slow, it was certain, and by 1200 s.c. this great civilization, which
had emerged around 3 0 0 0 B.c.. was no more.
This particular natural disaster might even offer an explanation
for an important event in the remembered history of the Hebrews:
Moses parting the waters of the Sea of Reeds (often erroneously trans



lated as the Red Sea). Could it be that the earthquakes associated
with the eruption of Thera temporarily drained the Sea of Reeds and
that this catastrophe became merged with the Exodus story? In light
o f the other phenomena described in the Hebrew literature as part of
this catastrophe— from fiery ash raining down to thunderous noise
and enveloping darkness—there is a high probability that this expla
nation is correct. This is corroborated by the well-known Ipuwer Pa
pyrus, which contains a haunting account paralleling the Hebrew
texts. The fairly precise date now available for the final explosion of
Thera— 1628 B.c.—obliges Egyptologists to recalibrate their dynas
tic chronology, which has long been recognized as rather shaky.
“When Thera exploded," wrote Charles Pellegrino, who summarized
the available evidence, “it changed the history o f the world."5
Volcanic eruptions followed by radical climatic changes, leading
to a three-hundred-year-long drought, are now thought to also have
been the cause of the collapse of the Mesopotamian empire of Akkad.
The country reached its golden age under Sargon (2371-2316 B . c . ) ,
who ruled for fifty-seven years, and continued to flourish under his
son Rimush and his grandson Manishtusu (2307-2292 B.c.). Then
suddenly, after a century of supremacy, the empire mysteriously col
lapsed. Towns were abandoned when a failing agriculture could no
longer sustain them.
Judging from their legends, the Mesopotamian people blamed the
haughty Manishtusu for the empire’s demise. Modern geologists, on
the basis of microscopic analysis of soil samples, believe that the real
culprit was volcanic activity, possibly in nearby Turkey, which cov
ered the region in ash. They do not even consider the ancient theory
that a “good" king staves off such disasters by his very goodness.
There is no place in geology for any thought that connects natural
events with human consciousness. Some avant-garde quantum physi
cists are not so sure. In any case, after a hiatus o f three centuries,
both the rains and the people returned to the middle region of the
Tigris and Euphrates, creating the Babylonian Empire.
An earlier catastrophe occurred before 3 0 0 0 B . c . in the heartland
o f what was then Sumer and what is now the coastal area o f Iraq.
Digging at Ur in the late 1920s, Sir Leonard Woolley sunk a shaft
84 (t) IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



down to a level corresponding to roughly 3 0 0 0 B . c . Thereafter, to his
utmost surprise, he encountered twelve feet of mud before finding
further strata of artifacts. He calculated that the mud was deposited
by a flood no less than twenty-five feet deep, perhaps reflecting the
fifteen cubits mentioned in Genesis.
It is difficult to know the exact extent o f this natural disaster. It
undoubtedly affected the Sumerians and possibly some o f their neigh
bors in a profound way. Sir Leonard concluded that he had discov
ered archaeological evidence for the Great Flood mentioned in the
Gilgamesh epic, which apparently served as the model for the bibli
cal account of the deluge. The Sumerian equivalent o f Noah is Uta
Napishtim who was instructed by God Enki to build an ark and save
himself and his loved ones.
It was after the flood that, according to the Sumerian sources,
kingship was sent down from on high. The first dynasty o f the an
cient city o f Ur is thought to have been established around 3 1 0 0 B . c . ,
but a slightly later date is equally possible. The first ruler was
Mesannipadda, who reigned for eighty years.
In Sir Leonard's assessm ent, the level of artistic accomplishment
was higher around 3 5 0 0 B .c . than in dynastic times— that is, there
was a decline that may have been caused by economic and other
setbacks resulting from the flood.0A similar cultural decline has been
noticed also for pharaonic Egypt, suggesting a progressive dtying up
of this country's original inspirational forces, which were no doubt
anchored in its spiritual heritage.
There is a fascinating parallel between the emergence of the dy
nastic houses of Sumer and the beginning o f the pharaonic dynas
ties. The first dynasty of Egypt has widely been fixed around 3 1 8 0
b .c. Yet, there is no unanimity among scholars, and some Egyptologists
place it two or three centuries later. In India, the beginning o f our
present world age—the kali-yu ga—is traditionally assigned to 3102
b .c. This date may coincide with the advent of the reign of Manu
Vaivasvata, as fixed by some scholars. The flood, according to an
cient Indian sources, occurred shortly before Manu's rulership.
A third and final parallel, which can hardly be coincidental, comes
from a civilization on the other side of our planet—the Maya of
CATASTROPHE AND RECONSTRUCTION (t) 85



Mesoamerica. The Maya named the date 13.0.0 .0 .0 4 Ahau 8 Cumku
as the beginning of the present world cycle. According to the
Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation, this date corresponds to
August 12, 3113 B.c.7
Most interestingly, Mayan cosmology knows of five world cycles.
The first world was destroyed by the earth element, the second by
the air element, the third by fire, and the fourth by water (the Great
Flood). We are now in the fifth world cycle, which is destined to be
destroyed by earthquakes on December 24, 2012 a .d .
Whatever we make o f these curious chronological agreements,
what is certain is that the world's mythologies and literatures re
member geological changes, often sudden in nature, that trauma
tized, paralyzed, or destroyed their cultures. Such events were un
doubtedly formative experiences, shaping both the consciousness and
culture o f early civilized humanity. Some observers o f human nature
have suggested that the dysfunctional character o f all civilizations
manifesting in aggression, wars, and ecological destructiveness
goes back to an original trauma: an unknown catastrophe o f mas
sive proportions.8
H istory as M yth, M yth as H istory
Our picture of the ancient world tends to be somewhat mono
chrome, filled with a succession of raids, conquests, and wars; power
hungry emperors and corrupt nobility; oppressed and manipulated
m asses; starvation and pestilence; technological achievements ac
complished by the sweat and blood of the many to the glorification of
the few.
Our history books say little about the truly great accomplish
ments o f our remote ancestors, notably their high level o f morality
and spirituality, as well as metaphysical insights and aspirations.
These mean little to our consumerist culture. However, if we want to
put true color into our picture of the past, we must begin to shed our
preconceptions and learn to look at the facts. Our histoty books know
nothing of the primordial tradition o f spirituality— the legacy left be
hind by our remote ancestors through the oral traditions of India,
86 (t) IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



CATASTROPHE AND RECONSTRUCTION 8 7
Sumer, Egypt, and other cultures. That primordial tradition revolved
around three things: first, the intercourse between humanity and the
divine or higher powers; second, human beings who represent the
good and those who are "fallen"; third, cycles of civilization that end
in various cataclysms.
For a long time, critical-minded readers of the Bible have looked
upon the Israelite's escape across the Sea of Reeds as little more than
a pious legend that has no substance in historical reality. Today we
stand corrected, thanks to the painstaking efforts o f archaeologists,
biologists, and geologists. Many other biblical references, previously
dismissed as incredible or imaginative, have meantime been sub
stantiated. Evidently, we must assume a more respectful attitude
toward the writings of the ancients. “What if," asks William Irwin
Thompson in his eminently readable book At th e E dge efH istory ,
“the history of the world is ‘a myth,’ but myth is the remains o f the
real history of earth?"9 Then again, we must not take the mythical
recollections of humanity too literally either but allow for both poetic
license and vested interest. 10
The purpose of the preceding consideration of cataclysms in his
toric times was to set the stage for our discussion of the ancient Indic
civilization in the next section. Sometimes Earth's catastrophes are
truly gargantuan, lifting or dropping large areas of land and shifting
forever the course of rivers with disastrous consequences for entire
cultures. This appears to be what happened in ancient India nearly
four thousand years ago. The Indian subcontinent experienced a trau
matic alteration that had a deep and lasting impact on human civili
zation in that part of the world. The geological changes caused a
major upheaval in the existing culture, leading to the collapse and/or
abandonment of numerous cities and villages in the region.
The G reat C atastrop h e: W hen R ivers V anish
The Indus River meanders from the Himalayas to the Arabian
Sea—a stretch o f 1,800 miles. Most of the land to the immediate east
of the Indus is barren land. Extending over roughly 100,000 square
miles, the Thar Desert, which is comparable in size to the Syrian



Desert, forms a natural divide between the Indus and the Gangetic
valleys. It also is the untouched grave of a large part of the early
Indic civilization, which collapsed after around 1900 B .c.
The discovery of Mohenjo-Daro on the west bank of the Indus
River some 2 00 miles from the shores of the Arabian Sea and of
Harappa about 3 5 0 miles further north encouraged archaeologists to
look for other sites along the fertile banks of the Indus. Their search
was rewarded with such sites as Chanhu Daro, Amri, and Kot Diji.
Hastily, they named these sites collectively “Indus civilization."
What they did not know
then, but which is well-estab
lished fact today, many more
sites of that civilization are
located not along the Indus
but in the m iddle of the
desert, buried under moun
tains of sand. 11 Obviously,
when these vanished towns
were still goingconcerns they
could not possibly have
thrived in a desert environ
ment. Indeed, as satellite pho
tographs have revealed, what
is now the Thar Desert, also
known as the Great Indian
Desert, was once traversed by
a great river with its own fer
tile banks. Geologists have
identified this moribund river,
an extension of the present
day Ghaggar, as the Sarasvati
mentioned in the Vedic scriptures. This great river flowed from the
Tibetan Himalayas into the Arabian Sea, covering a distance similar
to the Indus.
Clearly, the Sarasvati and its many tributaries, which also show
up on satellite photographs, formed an immense system that sup

plied a large area with ample water and fertile soil. More than that,
the photographs revealed artificial canals carrying water to more re
mote locations for the cultivation o f crops. 12 Scientists are as yet un
decided whether the canals were filled only during the monsoon
months or throughout the year.
If archaeologists had looked beyond the ruins and artifacts they
were able to recover from the soil around the Indus River, and had
taken note of the most ancient and sacred Hindu scripture— the Rig
Veda—they would not have been surprised by the treasures hidden
beneath the sands o f the sprawling Thar Desert. The R g - Veda un
questionably speaks of a mighty river— the Sarasvati (“She who
flows")—that should not be identified with the Indus but the Ghaggar
(or Hakra, as another portion of it is known in Pakistan). For the
composers o f the R ig- Veda, the Sarasvati was the largest of seven
rivers forming the life support o f the Vedic civilization.
The area o f northwestern India, which was the heartland o f the
early Indic civilization, is today known as the Punjab. The Sanskrit
equivalent is p a n ca -a p , meaning “five w aters," referring to the
Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej, which flow into the Indus. In
ancient times we find no reference to a five-river region. But the
texts speak of a seven-river region, which was called sap ta-sain d h av a
or “land belonging to the seven rivers," of which the largest and
most central was the Sarasvati.
The name sap ta-sain d h av a is derived from the Sanskrit sap ta
(“seven") and sindhu (“stream"), the latter giving rise to the mod
ern words Indus and Sindh. This expression suggests that in Vedic
times the Punjab as we know it today did not exist and that the
center o f the seven-river region was further east on the Sarasvati.
Often mentioned in the early Sanskrit scriptures are the Indus itself,
the Sarasvati, the Parushni (modern Ravi), and the Yamuna (Jumna).
The Drishadvati, which has been identified with the now small rivers
Chautang and Naiwala, has but a single reference in the Vedas. Ac
cording to the M anu-Sam hita (ll.1 7-18), the “land o f the brahmins"
once lay between the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati.
The mightiest o f all the rivers of northern India was the Sarasvati,
which the Vedic seer-bards praised in the following words:

The phrase “yielded milk and
g h ee" in the above Rig-Vedic
verse reminds one o f the biblical
expression, “the land where milk
and honey flow." It was applied to the fertile region in which the
Hebrew tribes finally settled after their forty years of wandering in
the sun-baked desert. Both expressions suggest plenitude, because
o f the presence o f precious water that renders the soil fertile for live
stock and gardens. Like Ganga in later Hindu mythology, Sarasvati
was personified as a Goddess and was said to have descended from
heaven. That is to say, she brought divine sustenance—what the He
brews called m an n a (probably from m an, “g ift")— for the Vedic
peoples.
Originally, the Sarasvati flowed through Rajasthan and poured
itself into the Gulf of Kutch near the Rathiawar peninsula. Kutch it
self was once an island at the mouth o f the Sarasvati. It did not cease
to be an island until about two thousand years ago, as the ancient

number of sites were destroyed or damaged by floods, and many
others were abandoned because of changing river courses. The event
would have had to take place rather quickly to allow for sites to be
abandoned altogether, particularly those on the Indus where water
continued to be available. At any rate, the geological alteration caused
the drying-up of the Sarasvati River and most of its tributaries.
P ictu rin g th e P a st: A P ossible Scen ario
If the change was indeed relatively sudden, we can propose the
following scenario: We can envision tidal waves randomly flooding
large areas, and broken dams and walls of water bearing down on
unsuspecting townsfolk and villagers, sweeping them miles away
from their homes, together with panicky livestock, uprooted trees,
boats torn loose from their anchor points, and the debris of houses.
We also can imagine the water from the Himalayas seeking new path
ways. causing a similar devastation in other areas. The Indian scholar
Ram Nath Kak has suggested that, as part of this cataclysm, the
natural dam holding the waters in the Kashmir Valley, which was
originally a giant lake, broke; 13 this made the valley habitable, but
the immense volume of water coming down the Indus River flooded
riverine cities such as Mohenjo-Daro, hastening their demise. Floods
were also caused by the Sutlej, which shifted its course from the
Sarasvati to the Indus.
The cataclysm left behind desiccated river beds, empty canals,
parched soil and, finally, abandoned towns and villages. Gradually,
as trees and crops died for lack of water, wind-blown sand filled the
gaping river beds, crumbling canals, and vacant towns and villages.
Drying rivers became stagnant pools of undrinkable water, too
shallow to navigate with trade vessels and soon bereft of fish for
food. Once arable soil became baked and sterile under the hot Indian
sun, yielding no more sustenance for either the peasant families or
the urbanites. With the disappearance of the once lush vegetation,
the climate changed as well, yielding fewer and inadequate rains
that never allowed the soil to recover.
Family after family was forced to relocate. We can imagine that
92 (V IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



many people succumbed to illness as a result of malnutrition or from
exhaustion or misfortune duri ng their exodus from the cities and
villages. Some families must have headed north toward the Himalayas.
Others may well have braved the trek westward across an increas
ingly deserted landscape, until they reached relatives or friends in
the settlements of the Indus. Yet others must have migrated south in
the hope o f land and livelihood nearer the ocean.
Those heading westward will have found that the region o f the
Indus River had suffered great adversity as well. We can imagine
dams breaking under the stress from the tectonic uplift and flooding
the towns and smaller settlements along its banks. In fact, the earth
has continued to shift under the Indus settlements. The three lowest
levels of occupation at Mohenjo-Daro are under water, preventing
archaeologists from recovering the telltale signs of their history.
Most people appear to have migrated not toward the Indus but
eastward into the fertile valley o f the Ganges and its tributaries. 14
The Gangetic valley had been inhabited a t least since 5 0 0 0 B.c. It is
possible that some o f the families might have had relatives in that
part of India. At any rate, the emigrés encountered new difficulties
and dangers there. For the thickly forested and swampy area, with
heavy monsoon rains, was teaming with wild beasts. The refugees
from the calamitous Indus-Sarasvati region had to clear the forests
in order to build new settlements, plant gardens, plow fields, and
create grazing land for their livestock.
But as the pioneering spirit surfaced in them, they found the
strength to rebuild their civilization— unlike the people left behind
along the Indus River who, after the collapse of the larger civiliza
tion, never succeeded in reconstructing a comparable urban civiliza
tion . The point of gravity of the early Indic civilization shifted from
west to east, from the Sarasvati to the Ganges.
In the S h atap ath a (“Hundred P aths")-Brahm ana, we encounter
a vivid description of the conquest o f the swampy area east o f the
Ganges, either after the collapse of the Sarasvati towns or somewhat
before. 's Since this scripture speaks o f the events as happening at
the time of its composition, we can date this particular passage of the
S hatapatha-B rahm an a to around 1900 B.c. or earlier:

The phrase “burned out” (atidadaha) by God Agni does not re
fer to any artificial conflagration created by the brahmins. It is prob
ably a metaphoric statement about the rivers drying out through the
agency of Agni in the form o f the scorching sun, of which this deity
is a manifestation. Alternatively, it could be a reference to the ritual
purification of the rivers and their surrounding land by means of
proper sacrifices in which God Agni played a leading role. In the
opening hymn of the R ig-V eda, Agni is called God of the sacrifice.
In an earlier verse of the above passage from the S hatapatha
B rahm an a, King Mathava is said to have carried Agni in his mouth
and therefore did not speak when spoken to by his chief priest. How
ever, when the sagely Gotama Rahugana, his chief priest, forecefully
invoked God Agni, the deity leaped forth from the king’s mouth.
This is supposed to have occurred when Mathava was still at the
Sarasvati River. From there Agni is said to have moved eastward.
Possibly this legend was meant to account for the desiccation of en
tire rivers at that time. Only Agni was thought capable of the terrify
94 (,!) IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



ing power of evaporating, “burning out," their massive waters. The
Rig- Veda portrays him not only as a manifestation of the sun but
also an offspring of the waters, meaning the oceans (which is where
the sun is “born” in the east).
Because the S hatapatha-B rahm an a does not mention the dry
ing up of the Sarasvati itself as the reason for the eastward migra
tion of the brahmins and their people, we may assume that this mi
gration likely took place prior to 1900 B .c . Perhaps it occurred sev
eral hundred years earlier when the signs of spreading environmen
tal disaster were becoming obvious to the inhabitants of northwest
ern India. It is curious that the passage does not remember the mi
grations as a tragic necessity but more as an opportunity to cultivate
the land to the east of the Sarasvati.
After the worst of the great catastrophe had happened, wherever
people may have gone in search of a better fortune, the society and
civilization they once knew was no longer. Beyond question, the dis
persal left people traumatized—a trauma that was surely passed on
for several generations, until a family or clan had established itself
firmly in the new country. We can only guess at the response of the
governing elite, which saw its power base undermined with the dev
astation of the land and the emigration of the work force. Northern
India's humanity entered a period of relative dormancy, marked by
the struggle for survival and psychic recovery.
The Indian peninsula is still shifting and tilting. Earlier this cen
tury, the Bolan River in eastern Baluchistan shifted course westward.
This time the disaster was fairly local, but, to the chagrin of archae
ologists, it led to the flooding of the oldest part of the Mehrgarh site,
which will be introduced in Chapter 8. On the other hand, the shift of
the Bolan River exposed hitherto buried Neolithic settlement struc
tures. Similarly, it seems likely that the buckling that caused the death
of the Sarasvati River system also caused more positive geological
changes elsewhere, such as new rivers or better flows in existing
rivers. No doubt, in the coming years geologists will invest all the
necessary ingenuity in exploring such questions.
CATASTROPHE AND RECONSTRUCTION (t) 95



Life a fte r th e C atastrop he
The massive hydrological changes and their climatic consequences
in the Land of the Seven Rivers had far-reaching sociocultural reper
cussions. The early Indic civilization was laid to sleep in northwest
ern India. The cities and towns along the Indus River ceased to flour
ish and were finally abandoned as well. With the death of the heart
land in the Sarasvati River system, the western region lost a vital
stimulus, which spelled its own decline over a period of a hundred
years or so.
But life is incredibly resilient, and, given the slightest opportu
nity, will recover even from a great trauma. We can see this, for in
stance, in the case of the collapse of the classical Maya civilization
around 900 a.d. The collapse did not spell complete and utter de
struction, even though numerous cities were abandoned and left in
ruins. Rather, the Maya civilization continued to thrive in a trans
formed manner until the infelicitous Spanish conquest. In fact, it con
tinues to exist in rural Mexico and is even tentatively undergoing a
spiritual renewal.
Similarly, the ancient Indic civilization did not become extinct
but simply shifted its center of vitality eastward toward the Ganges.
It took, however, thirty or more generations before what has been
called a “second urbanization" in the Ganges and Yamuna Valleys
took place, starting around 1000 B.c. or perhaps a century later, though
the Dwaraka site of 1500 B.c. suggests at least a smaller intermedi
ate period of urbanization as well. Remembrance of the period of
forest living in the Gangetic region before this second urbanization
may be contained in the sacred books appropriately called A ranyakas,
or “forest books.” The A ran yakas and the U panishads, by this reck
oning, should belong to the second millennium B.c.
This apparently was also the time of the further development of
the doctrines about reincarnation, karma, and spiritual liberation.
Scholars have often presented these teachings as complete novelties.
However, a closer study of the earlier sacred literature, as embodied
in the four Vedic hymnodies, shows that the U panishads by and
large merely disclose and, to a degree, elaborate secret teachings that

had a long preceding history. But we can expect that the social and
political restructuring after the catastrophe had some unquantifiable
impact on the introspection in the forest hermits and their explana
tions of age-old teachings.
It is important to understand, however, that the reconstruction
was a natural evolution from the earlier world. There was a continu
ing celebration of the glory days of the third millennium B .c . Even
now the Vedic ritual requires the use of copper implements and bar
ley that had been used before the catastrophe. Later art shows no
break with the Indus-Sarasvati art.
If we consider the evidence of the Neolithic town of Mehrgarh,
which will be discussed in Chapter 8, the second urbanization should



more appropriately be considered as the fourth phase in India's town
making history, the third wave consisting of cities like Harappa and
Mohenjo-Daro. The second wave of urbanization comprises towns
like Balakot and Amri, which belong to a two-thousand-year period
beginning around 4000 B.c. In this schema, the Gangetic urbaniza
tion, representing the fourth phase in India's urban adventure, brings
us to the beginning of “historical” times, with the reasonably well
established dates for Gautama the Buddha (5 6 3 -4 8 3 B.c.) and
Mahavira (540-468 B.c.).
We must add here a note about the ever-popular archaeological
preoccupation with pottery shards. The second urbanization has fre
quently been associated with the end of the Painted Gray Ware (PGW)
phase (1 2 0 0 -8 0 0 B.c.) and with the introduction of the Northern Black
Polished Ware (NBP) pottery. Late Harappa was partially contempo
rary with the PGW phase. In other words, a continuous series of
cultural developments link the two early urbanizations of India. The
PGW pottery has been interpreted as the property of invading Ary
ans from the west. But more recent scholarship views it as a natural
development in craftsmanship from earlier pottery styles.
In a similar vein, there is a distinct difference in the brick-mak
ing of the two urbanizations. Yet, the difference cannot be explained
by the intrusion of extraneous cultural elements. The Harappans are
known to have used several brick sizes: 30 x 15 x 7.5 centimeters
and 4 0 x 20 x 1O centimeters being the most common, where in
these cases and others, the length, breadth, thickness ratio is about
4:2:1. The bricks used during the second urbanization ofthe Gangetic
valley are not according to this ratio. One type encountered there has
the ratio 7:4: 1. But this departure is most likely a result of the popu
larization of one of the existin g styles in a m ultiethnic and
multicultural society. Again we do not observe a complete break with
the earlier tradition but only reorganization and readjustment. Per
haps scholars are beginning to appreciate that past civilizations have
had their own changes in fashion, which need not necessarily have
been triggered by outside influences.
All the evidence points to a striking continuity between the early
urban culture of Mehrgarh and the second urbanization witnessed
98 (f) IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



in the fertile valley of the Ganges, which gave rise to the modern
Hindu civilization. India's humanity has undergone many trials and
tribulations. More than anything else, the repeated cataclysmic al
terations in the course of the rivers of northern India have both
tested and strengthened the resilience and creativity of the Indic
people. The modern Indian nation can look back upon the longest
continuous cultural history in the world—a fact that should inspire
confidence in its people in dealing with the massive problems and
challenges of today.

SevenRivers: TheLiteraryPerspective
O verview
WE HAVE LOOKEDATTHE ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE,
which revealed to us a unique civilization that, be
fore its time of tribulation around 1900 B.c., had
risen to a high level of urbanization in such cities
as Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, Ganweriwala, Rakhi
garhi, Kalibangan, Dholavira, and the harbor town of Lothal at the
Arabian Sea.
We also have shown that the popular model of invading, San
skrit-speaking Aryan nomads who broke the back of the early Indic
civilization by demolishing these splendid cities is nothing more than
scholarly fiction. The skeletons found in the streets of Mohenjo-Daro
were at first taken to be a sure sign of the violence done to the ur
banites at the hand of the Aryan invaders in the final days of that big
city. More recently, archaeologists have dropped this interpretation
of a massacre, since it received no support from other evidence found
in Mohenjo-Daro and other sites. They also recognized that the skel
etons belonged to different levels of occupation, which were not ad
equately distinguished by the pioneering excavators.
When we combine this with the fact that Indo-European speak
ers are now thought to have been present in Anatolia at the begin
ning of the Neolithic age, we arrive at an astonishing conclusion.



Modern researchers who have looked at all the evidence dispassion
ately now believe that the Vedic Aryans—a branch of the Indo-Euro
pean-speaking world— in all probability lived in India long before
they are supposed to have arrived there. T h is c o m p l e t e l y t u r n s t o p s y
t u r v y o u r v i e w o f a n c i e n t I n d i a a n d a n c i e n t h i s t o r y i n g e n e r a l ! Small
migrations of Indo-European-speaking groups as well as other peoples
may well have occurred in Harappan times, as they have throughout
India's history, but when they arrived in India they encountered a
society that had a prominent, if not dominant, Indo-European con
tingent—the Sanskrit-speaking Vedic peoples.
Thus the key question now is: What was the relationship be
tween the Vedic peoples and the civilization reflected in the great
cities of the Indus and Sarasvati Rivers and their tributaries?
The early Indic civilization, as we know it from towns like
Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, but even from the much earlier settle
ment of Mehrgarh, was multiracial and multiethnic, similar in com
position to the groups living in India today. Skeletons found at those
sites have been identified as belonging to the Proto-Australoid, Medi
terranean, Alpine, and Mongoloid races. We cannot rule out inter
marriage between these races and ethnic groups in an intense urban
environment. The Mediterranean race, such as most of the people in
India today belong to, including the so-called Aryans and Dravidians,
appears to have been the majority group.
We also must not pin particular languages to any of these racial
groups. Thus the idea that the Indo-European-speaking Aryans were
of the Nordic type is inherently misleading, since in simplistic fash
ion it equates language with race. The people of Harappa, Mohenjo
Daro, or Lothal may well have spoken various languages, and may
have had a lingua franca intelligible to all ethnic groups. However, as
we explain in the next chapter, statistical analysis of the Harappan
script strongly suggests that the language imprinted on the numer
ous soapstone seals was Indo-European rather than Dravidian. But
this does not rule out the presence of other languages in those cities,
or even on some of the seals.
As stated above, the scholarly notion that the Vedic Aryans en
tered the Harappan world as intruders from beyond the mountain
102 H IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



ranges of Afghanistan is no longer tenable. All the evidence points
to their .original home in India itself. Today we must consider the
Vedic peoples as an integral part of the early Indic civilization. They
walked the streets of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, if not old Mehrgarh,
and had their businesses there and in other towns and villages along
the Sarasvati and Indus Rivers and their many tributaries. It is even
quite likely that they were the principal creators and sustainers of
the lndus-Sarasvati civilization.
If this picture is essentially correct, we have in the Vedas, the
sacred scriptures of the Vedic Aryans and later Hindus, a most im
pressive body of documents about the life and culture o f a represen
tative segment of the early Indic civilization. In other words, we no
longer need to feel regret that our only source of information about
the Indus-Sarasvati civilization is a script that defies decipherment
and archaeological artifacts that raise many more questions than they
have answered so far.
The Vedas are a remarkably faithful record of many of the beliefs
and practices of that civilization. More than that, as we will explain,
the Rig- Veda is the oldest surviving body of work of an y civilization.
It fills the gap between the early culture o f the Neolithic town of
Mehrgarh and the subsequent civilization of the Indus and Sara
svati Rivers. Clearly, it deserves our full attention and unprejudiced
study.
The R ig - V eda: H ym ns o f P raise, H ym ns o f H istory
The British Vedicist Jeanine Miller has called the Rig-V eda “not
only a highly important religious and literary document" but “also a
work of art and a source of inspiration and edification.”' It certainly
is one of the most astounding relics of ancient humanity, for it dis
closes to us a cultural universe and a deep spirituality at a time for
which oral or written documents are unavailable in all other known
civilizations of the world.2 The great Sanskrit scholar Max Müller,
who translated the R ig- Veda in its entirety, said of the Vedic hymns
that “they are to us unique and priceless guides in opening before
our eyes tombs of thought richer in relics than the royal tombs of
THE LAND OF THE SEVEN RIVERS || 103



Egypt" and that “they have their own unique place and stand by
themselves in the literature of the world."3
While Müller rightly considered the Vedic hymns more ancient
than the oldest Babylonian and Akkadian hymns, he wrongly judged
them as being more primitive. He felt that “there are thoughts in
those ancient Mesopotamian hymns which would have staggered the
poets of the Veda. "4 Yet, the passages he quoted from the Mesopo
tamian literature fail to support his appraisal, despite their monothe
istic flavor for which they had undoubtedly been selected by him.

Müller remained by and large unaware of the deeper spiritual sig
nificance of many Vedic hymns, preferring like most academic
Vedicists a literal interpretation over a deeper metaphoric reading.
He also failed to appreciate the historical clues in the Rig- Veda, which
would have shown him that his dating for this hymnody was off the
mark by at least a whole millennium.
Consisting of 1,028 hymns, theRig- Veda is history in poetic form.
Many of its skillfully composed hymns are replete with statements
that have great relevance for the careful student of early Indic his
tory. The most significant conclusion drawn from the geological ref
erences contained in this archaic hymnody is that the sagely com
posers of the Rig- Veda must have lived prior to the great cataclysm
around 1900 b.c., for they still knew of the “seven rivers," notably
the Sarasvati.
Thus we may take 2 0 0 0 b.c. to be the lower limit for the compo



sition of the R ig- Veda. Very probably it is considerably older. The
subsequent Vedic literature— particularly the B rah m an as and
A rart^tfto—reflect a geography that is different from the one de
picted in the R ig-V eda. Although some B rah m an as mention the
Sarasvati River as an important place of habitation, these later works
show signs of an eastward migration of the Vedic peoples. As the
later Vedic literature unfolds, the Sarasvati recedes more and more
into the background and the Ganges gradually comes to the fore. The
Puranas, composed in post-Vedic times, have almost totally forgotten
about the Sarasvati and give all praise to the Ganges River. Unfortu
nately, we no longer have the original Purana, which is mentioned in
the early Vedic literature. We could expect its geographical informa
tion to confirm that of the R ig-V eda and other early Sanskrit works.
Be that as it may, from internal references in the Vedic literature
we can now state with some certainty that the R ig-V eda was not
composed, as maintained by many scholars under the spell of the
Aryan invasion model, around 1200 B.c., but a t lea st more than eight
centuries earlier. The hymn composers knew of an environment that
simply ceased to exist around 1900 B.c. What more concrete evi
dence could anyone wish for?
Similarly, the B rahm an as and A ran yakas, which are sacred scrip
tures based on the Rig- Veda, did not originate around 10 0 0 B.c. to
800 B.c. but around 2000 B.c. to 1500 B.c. This makes them contem
poraneous with the thirteenth to seventeenth dynasties of the “middle
kingdom" in Egypt, which saw the disintegration of the unified state
and the alien rule by the Asiatic Hyksos. However, the earliest
B rahm anas and, perhaps the original Purana (the source of all the
other Puranas of later tim es), appear to antedate the final systemati
zation of the R ig- Veda. If that is the case, then a considerable part of
this literature also must belong to the third millennium B.c.
Significantly, certain hymns in the R ig- Veda suggest a much ear
lier date than 2000 B.c. Thus statements in the Vedas refer to astro
nomical configurations that could only have occurred in the period
from 2000 B.c. to 6 0 0 0 B.c.5 As we explain in a later chapter, the
Vedic peoples were well versed in astronomy. Therefore, their state
ments should be given appropriate weight.
THE LAND OF THE SEVEN RIVERS || 10S



106 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
Due to the precession o f the equinoxes, the pole star is not al
ways the same. Around 3 0 0 0 B .c. it was Alpha Draconis rather than
Alpha Polaris, our current pole star. Alpha Draconis, also known as
Thuban, is a medium-bright star in the tail of the constellation Draco,
the Dragon, which winds halfway round the celestial pole. At that
time, the seven main stars of the Big Dipper also were close to the
polar axis, which may explain the prominence o f the “seven seers"
(sap ta-n sh i) associated with that constellation. Alpha Draconis was
considered to be the eighth seer, who, according to the Taittiriya
A ran yaka (1.7.20), does not depart from Meru, the cosmic moun
tain, corresponding to the celestial pole. We will say more about the
Indic peoples' knowledge of astronomy and especially the preces
sional phenomenon in Chapter 12.
References to the rising constellation at the time of solstice also
allow us to assign certain dates. Already Hermann Jacobi, a renowned
German scholar of the Vedic literature, noted that one of the hymns
o f the R ig -Veda (V. 18-19) suggests a stellar pattern that could only
have occurred in the period from 4 5 0 0 B .c. to 2 5 0 0 B .c ., indicating a
time in which the winter solstice occurred with the full moon in the
Phalguni constellation, marking the later portion of the sign Leo and
the early portion of the sign Virgo.b It is clear from this hymn that its
author was not referring to some distant past but to his own time.
This reading is confirmed by passages from later B rahm ana works.
Jacobi, in contradiction to most other scholars of his day, correctly
placed most of the Vedic hymns in that early period.
Unfortunately, Jacobi's more famous compatriot and fellow Vedic
researcher Max Müller ignored astronomical and calendrical allusions
in the Rig-V eda. Instead he favored, quite arbitrarily, the date of 1500
B .c . to 1200 B .c ., based primarily on Indo-European documents from
the Middle East and the erroneous Aryan invasion model. Müller's
view, though vehemently criticized by several eminent scholars of his
day, won not only because of his overwhelming authority in the field
of Indic studies, but because of the prevailing Eurocentric climate of
opinion that did not want to see India as central to world civilization.
Surprisingly enough, many contemporary books on the history
of India still echo this outdated view. For instance, the authors of a

book), contributed hymns to the first book. Other reputedly ancient
seers, such as Hiranyastupa, Kanva, Kutsa, Kakshivat, Dirghatamas,
and Agastya, also have their hymns in the first book. The attempt by
previous scholars to read a progression of thought into the Vedas
often overlooked the most basic facts of the Vedic lineages, which do
not reflect this idea at all.
Whatever the truth may be, the Vedic hymns all attained a sacred
status long ago and for millennia have been reverently looked upon as
revelation. Fortunately, this reverential attitude obliged generations of
the priestly families of India to memorize the sacred hymns with the
utmost fidelity. Children were trained early on by their fathers in the
art of memorization. Some were expected to learn all the hymns of the
Rig- Veda. Especially gifted individuals managed to learn not only the
R ig- Veda but also the other three Vedic hymnodies. The Vedic hymns
were not only used during rituals but also were studied in themselves
as treasured sources of spiritual knowledge and moral guidance.
Given the astonishingly faithful transmission of the lore em
bodied in the R ig- Veda, we must consider it as a primary source of
knowledge for the early Indic civilization, which is even more impor
tant than the archaeological remains. For the artifacts dug up by
archaeologists more often than not leave us guessing about their
true meaning and place within the larger social and cultural context
of the era to which they belong. By contrast, words—recorded with
such fidelity as those of the R ig- Veda—provide many more clues
than any artifacts ever could.
The Indus-Sarasvati artifacts and the testimony of the Rig- Veda
and the other Vedic collections can illuminate each other, and, taken
together, they represent a formidable body of evidence for an era in
which we encounter only pervasive silence in the rest of the world.

Map 5. Themerchants efthe Indus-Sarasvati civilization early on extended their trade by sea to other countries.
According to a popular scholarly stereotype, the Vedic Aryans
were cattle- and sheep-breeding seminomadic pastoralists. This may
well be an accurate portrayal of a certain section of the Vedic society.
However, the Vedic Aryans were more than wandering herders. They
also were city dwellers and enthusiastic seafarers and merchants
whose business took them the whole length of the great Sarasvati
and Indus Rivers, as well as out into the oceans.9
As we have repeatedly emphasized, the Vedic peoples did not
come as conquerors and destroyers from outside India, but lived in
and even built the cities in the Land o f the Seven Rivers. In several
Rig-Vedic hymns, God Agni (associated with fire) is invoked to pro
tect the Aryans with a hundred cities. 10 If they had no cities, the
prayer would be nonsensical. The positive attitude toward cities is



IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
further evident from several hymns in which one or the other Aryan
deity is likened to a vast supporting city. Indra, a principal deity of
the Vedic pantheon, is said in the R ig- Veda (VI1.26.3) to govern all
cities “like a common single husband for many w ives."11
I t is true that the Rig- Veda mentions the destruction or conquest
oflarge fortresses or towns (called p u r or pu ra), but there is nothing
in the hymns to justify the generally assumed dichotomy between
peaceful city-dwelling Harappans and destructive Aryan nomads.
Moreover, an earlier generation of scholars has argued that the Vedic
word pur did not signify a town or fortress but simply an earthwork
to protect against flooding or enemies. But this argument has been
greatly weakened by the discovery of the Indus-Sarasvati civiliza
tion with its numerous towns and, of course, by our present identifi
cation of that civilization with the Vedic peoples.
Politically, the early Indic civilization was very likely split into a
number of tribally aligned kingdoms, some of which appear to have
been quite large. This was still the case at the time of Gautama the
Buddha in the sixth century B.c. Evidently, the wars mentioned in
the Rig- Veda were chiefly intertribal conflicts among the Vedic peoples themselves and their various kingdoms. The enemies were either
fallen Atyans (groups deviating, perhaps only temporarily, from Vedic
values) or non-Aryans (tribes perhaps not speaking an Indo-Euro
pean language or sharing the moral values of the Vedic peoples). But
we have no way of determining whether the antagonists belonged to
the first or second group, as they are nowhere differentiated in the
Vedas in those terms. From the Vedic point o f view, all human beings
are descendants of Manu who, like the biblical Adam, is considered
to be the common ancestor of all human beings.
Thus the enemies of the celebrated Vedic King Sudas are de
scribed in the R ig- Veda as being both Aryans and Dasas or Dasyus.
Both groups are traced to th esam e Vedic ancestors and their tribes.12
In classical Sanskrit, the word d a sa means “servant" or “slave,"
but in those early times it must have stood for the exact opposite o f
the word a ry a (“noble"). In other words, the Dasyus were ignoble
folk, people lacking the spiritual vision of the Vedic Aryans. The
Iranians provide further illumination here. For d a h a , the Iranian



THE LAND OF THE SEVEN RIVERS 111
equivalent of d a sa, represents the common Aryan people. It is for
this reason that scholars have suggested that the Aryan-Dasa con
flict might ju st represent a struggle between the Indic and the Ira
nian Aryans. In most instances, however, the conflict appears to be
entirely mythological.
Thus in several hymns, the Dasyus are described as dark-skinned,
and this has often been taken as a telltale sign that they were a
Dravidian-speaking race. However, such references are not so much
racial descriptions as metaphors, referring to the symbolic battle be
tween light and darkness, as it is described in most ancient mytholo
gies. For instance, the battle between light and darkness is mirrored
in the struggle between the Egyptian solar deity Ra and the demons
of darkness, in the war between the deities of the Greek pantheon
and the Titans, and in the biblical battle between God and Satan.
This mythological motif is most evident in the Zoroastrian (ancient
Persian) conflict between Ahura Mazda and Ahriman. ln many of
these myths the enemy can be equated with the principle of evil, the
dark forces of existence. It seems strange that, in the case of India,
scholars should have turned this cosmological-theological myth into
a racial war.
In one instance, the hymn composers call the Dasyus “noseless”
(an asa), which some modern interpreters of the R ig- Veda have un
derstood in deprecating racial terms as “flat-nosed," taking this to
be a reference to the Dravidians of South India. But it is not the
Dravidians who are racially low-nosed but the aborigines of India.
At any rate, the term a n a sa does not mean “flat-nosed" but “without
nose" or “noseless." This descriptive adjective applies not to any
human group but to the serpent race of Vedic mythology, as further
designations of the Dasyus as “handless" and “footless" indicate. 13
The Dasyus are usually a group of serpentlike demons, and only
occasionally is this epithet used as a metaphor for evil people.
It is also curious that this designation, whose meaning is actu
ally in dispute and which occurs but a single time in the entire Vedic
literature, should have become one of the cornerstones of the Aryan
invasion theory. If the same strategy were used in regard to other
rare and disputed terms in the Vedas, we could create any number of



IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
bizarre theories. In any case, the identification o f the Dasyus with
the Dravidians or some other non-Aryan group is disproved by the
fact that, in some contexts, the name Dasyu is applied to fallen Ary
ans, who could often be reinstated as Aryans once they purified
themselves.
It is clear from the Vedic hymns that the tribes conquered by
King Sudas had the same culture but were deemed renegades, who
followed different priests, perhaps challenging the ruling orthodoxy
and, above all, who were led by kings considered to be unrighteous.
The Dasyus are usually described as fallen kshatriyas, or members
of the warrior class, who have become unspiritual, flouting the proper
rituals. In hymn Vil. 7 of the R ig- Veda, the Dasyus are identified with
the Panis, the well-to-do merchants who are said to be harmful in
their speech and without faith. Perhaps, from the point of view of the
Vedic orthodoxy, they were what we would now call materialists.
They may have been blinded by the allurements of the cities and
were possibly a little jaded from their travels in foreign lands, where
they encountered other customs and beliefs. The Panis's greed knew
no bounds, for elsewhere in the R ig-V eda, they are denounced as
cattle thieves.
Some researchers, including one of the present authors (David
Frawley), have speculatively associated or equated the Vedic Panis
with the Phoenicians. It appears that both were enterprising mer
chants. The Phoenicians called themselves Canaanites and spoke a
Semitic tongue closely related to Hebrew. Racially, they were also
close to the Hebrew-speaking tribes. The Greeks called them Phoenike
and the Romans spoke of them as the Poeni. Their Greek name, first
used by the bard Homer, is the familiar p hoen ix in the singular, which
originally referred to a dark red or purple color. Perhaps it was ap
plied to the Canaanites because of their brownish skin color.
The Phoenicians were a great maritime nation and were famed
for their nautical skills. They had succeeded in circumnavigating Africa
and there is some evidence that they might even have sailed (or
drifted) across the Atlantic to the New World. It is feasible that they
also reached India at an early age, though this is pure speculation.
Although the origins of these industrious people are a mystery, they



were busy pursuing international commerce already before 3 0 0 0 B.c.
When, around 2 2 0 0 B.c., their seafaring power was temporarily in
terrupted by military attacks upon their coastal cities, the Egyptians
complained about the lack of cedar wood for their sarcophagi. The
connections between the civilizations of antiquity are only poorly
understood, but we know that they existed and possibly were far
more intensive than we can gauge from the scant evidence available.
Judging from the Vedic literature, the Panis seemed strongly moti
vated by profit, and perhaps a hunger for adventure, and in their
maritime trade had carved out a lucrative niche for themselves for
literally thousands of years.
At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the early Vedic
references to the Panis are heavily mythologized, and it is difficult, if
not impossible, to reach any definite picture of them as actual people.
King Sudas's war against the ten kings, mentioned above, was a
defensive battle against hostile forces that had formed an overpow
ering coalition, which was seeking to strangu late Sudas's righteous
kingdom at the Sarasvati River. As the Vedic hymns relate, Sudas
miraculously triumphed over his enemies—not least thanks to the
prayers of the chief priest Vasishtha, if we can believe his own testi
mony, as given in the Rig- Veda (Vll.33.3). Vasishtha and his fellow
priests apparently enabled Sudas's army to cross the river during a
flood, while the priesthood of the hostile alliance failed to do the
same, thus causing the drowning of even the swiftest warriors. Much
later, Moses is credited with working a similar miracle for the He
brews, who safely crossed the Sea of Reeds, whereas the pursuing
Egyptian force was annihilated by the waves. As noted earlier, there
may be a naturalistic interpretation for this miracle, which in itself
need not discredit the biblical view of this extraordinary event. After
all, if miracles are not wonderful coincidences, what are they?
Sudas, head of the Tritsus, is also said to have destroyed or con
quered seven towns, which appear to have been cities of his
adversarial kinsm en.14 The civil war fought by Sudas supposedly
claimed the lives of 6 6 ,6 6 0 enemies, reminding one of other Vedic
battles that speak of 6 0 ,0 0 0 or 100,000 among the conquered. With
ten hostile kingdoms involved, this figure is not impossible, though
THE LAND OF THE SEVEN RIVERS || 113



114 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
it is more likely that such numbers encode certain characteristics and
are not to be taken literally.
In later Vedic literature we learn that the sons of Sudas them
selves fell from the Aryan way of life and consequently were called
ra ksh a sa s, or “demons." They are accused of killing the hundred
sons of the great seer Vasishtha, who guided Sudas. We also learn
that the Kavashas, who had been among those defeated by Sudas,
were reinstated and became the chief priests (purohita) of the Kum
dynasty, the most celebrated of the royal dynasties of ancient India.
One of the Kavashas, Tura Kavasheya, even heads an important list
of Upanishadic sages! Clearly, a ry a and dasyu are terms describing
not race but behavior. As the behavior of a group or individual
changed, so did the label.
Another, earlier king by the name of Divodasa is mentioned in
the eighth book of the R ig-V eda as the destroyer of the hundred
towns of Shambara. Aided by God Indra, Divodasa also “caused the
seven rivers to flow to the sea." Some interpreters have taken this to
mean that he demolished the artificial dams regulating the flow of
the rivers in northern India, with the result that the land below the
dams was devastated by flooding. However, the release of the seven
rivers appears to have primarily a spiritual significance. It is pos
sible, though, that in addition to its symbolic message the myth re
members a huge flood. Be that as it may, we have no firm historical
information about either Divodasa or the conquered King Shambara,
but both lived before Sudas.15
In another Rig-Vedic hymn (IV.61.2), Divodasa is described as
defeating the Turvashas and the Yadus, two of the five main Vedic
tribes, suggesting that Shambara was of the same group. This idea is
confirmed in various Puranas, where Divodasa, king of Kashi (Vara
nasi or Benares), is reported as having defeated the Yadus. As a
matter of fact, most of the battles mentioned in the Purana literature
are against the Yadus, who are the branch of the Vedic people most
frequently called Dasyus or given other similar derogatory names.
The sixth incarnation (avatara) of God Vishnu, who bears the name
Parashu Rama (“Rama with the Axe"), is specifically said to have
come into being in order to defeat the Yadus. The great king Sagara



of Ayodhya is also said to have defeated them after they had overrun
all of northern India.
Even demon-ruler Ravana, who was defeated by King Rama, is
related in the R am qyan a epic to the demon Lavana, who ruled
Mathura, one o f the main cities o f the Yadus. Furthermore, the first
people from northern India to come to Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon),
where Ravana ruled, are said to have hailed from Gujarat, a land of
the Yadus. Significantly, the R am ayan a speaks o f Ravana as a
brahmin and a chanter of the Sam a- Veda. Incidentally, even Vritra,
the Vedic archdemon who is killed by Indra, is thought to have been
a brahmin. It is also important to note that the eighth incarnation of
Vishnu, Lord Krishna, took birth am ongthese same Yadus, who also
produced a number of pious kings and sages. In light o f this evi
dence, it is safe to assume that the Vedic and Puranic battles— when
they are not purely allegorical— are among peoples of the same cul
ture but of different spiritual status as a result of their behavior.
We also want to emphasize that mere pastoralists, as the Aryans
have always been described, do not build towns or ships, establish
kingdoms, or maintain organized armies. They certainly do not ven
ture out into the ocean in pursuit o f commerce with other nations.
But this is exactly
what we know about
the Vedic people from
the hymns of the Rig
Veda, which mention
the two oceans to the
east and the west
(probably the Bay of
Bengal and the Ara
bian Sea), just as they
mention ships and
maritime trade.
Bhujyu, who is
one o f the main an
cestral figures o f the Vedic people, is said in the R ig- Veda (1.116.5)
to have been brought home safely in a ship with a hundred oars.

116 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
Although Bhujyu is one of the many names of the sun, the mention
of a ship with a hundred oars may not be mere fantasy. The idea of
a houseboat is implied in several hymns, and so is ocean travel over
a period of many days. The Vedic people were well aware that the
Indus and the Sarasvati poured their water into the ocean, that the
ocean roars, is ever in motion through its waves, and encircles the
land masses.
The picture of the Vedic people as seafaring merchants meshes
perfectly with the archaeological evidence of the Indus-Sarasvati civi
lization. Apart from foreign artifacts in the Indus cities and Indus
artifacts overseas, there are also steatite seals depicting seaworthy
vessels. The Aryan invasion model, which is predicated on the no
tion that the Vedic Aryans were seminomadic cattle breeders, can
offer no valid explanation for the numerous references to maritime
interest in the Vedas. However, when we realize that the Vedic people
and the Harappans represent one and the same culture, we can per
fectly understand the extraordinary parallels between archaeological
artifacts and literary evidence.
The seafaring nature of the Hindus is well known from later
sources. King Hiram of Tyre (Phoenicia) in 97 5 B .c . traded with India
through the port of Ophir (Supara) near modern Bombay. What most
historians have failed to notice in this is that Supara is a Sanskrit
name, thus placing the Vedic people on the coast of south central
India before 1000 B .c . We also know that Aryans from northern In
dia began migrating to Sri Lanka before the time of the Buddha (563
B .c .) . Additionally, inscriptions in the Brahmi alphabet have been
found in Indonesia from the third century B .c .16 These accomplish
ments would be highly improbable if the Aryans had been land-based
nomads, who conquered India gradually after 1500 b .c.
In Chapter 7, we will speak of the archaeological discovery of
stamp seals from the early Indic civilization in the Middle East and
elsewhere. A script resembling that of the Indic civilization has been
found on the remote Easter Island. Although the origin of the Easter
Island glyphs remains an enigma, as does the origin o f the islanders
themselves, most scholars have a priori excluded the possibility of
maritime travel in the ancient world. Yet, the Polynesians, who are



THE LAND OF THE SEVEN RIVERS 117
racially mixed (including a strong European strand), long ago crossed
the oceans in seemingly precarious boats to populate the islands in
the middle of the Pacific.
The truth is that the capacity for sea travel among ancient peoples
has been systematically underestimated. There is mounting evidence
that theywere in factwell accomplished in maritime navigation, cross
ing thousands of miles of open ocean, guided by the stars and handed
down navigational charts. '7
Harappan seals discovered at several Mesopotamian sites have
been dated to about 2 4 0 0 B.c. Judging from the available evidence,
the flow of goods seems to have gone primarily from India westward
to Mesopotamia, rather than from Mesopotamia to India. Early Indic
merchants very probably made their home in the towns of the Middle
East, acting as importers of goods from India. Unlike India,
Mesopotamia is not rich in natural resources. Although the Sumerians
knew how to drain the marshes and irrigate the land, they and their
Akkadian descendants heavily depended on imports. Sumer’s soil
was so arid that it did not even produce trees, and was almost with
out stone. The timber for houses, ships, and temples had to be labo
riously transported from far away, which bespeaks of the Sumerians'
industriousness, creativity, and resolution. They have occasionally
been portrayed as a somewhat unreligious people, but the central
position of the temple in each Sumerian city hardly bears out this
judgment. However, their religiosity may not have been the deep,
spontaneous spirituality of the Vedic people, as we can glean it from
theRig- Veda and other sacred scriptures. Rather the Sumerians, who
called themselves “black-heads” (san g -n g ig a), appear more re
strained, formal, and perhaps even prosaic in their orientation to
religious matters. If this impression is correct, they anticipated the
attitude of the Romans by three thousand years.
The M ysterious L an d s o f M eluhha, M agan, and D ilm un
The Mesopotamians knew of the great countries of Meluhha,
Magan, and Dilmun. The identity of Dilmun is still a mystery. How



ever, most scholars today tentatively identify itas the island ofBahrain
in the Arabian/Persian Gulf, and perhaps the nearby coastal land on
the Arabian peninsula. By the middle of the third century, Bahrain
was densely populated, serving as a stopover for seafaring merchants,
especially of Indic origin. The renowned British archaeologist Geoffrey
Bibby, who directed the early excavations in Bahrain, made the fol
lowing significant statement in his book L ookin g Jor Dilmun:
A pu zzle rem ained. Why h a d Dilmun used th e stan dard
w eights q fth e Indus Valley? The B abylonians an d Sum erians
used a com pletely differen t system . . . E ither th efirst com

n otfro m M esopotam ia bu tfro m India, or e lse India w as a
J a r m ore im portant com m ercial connection with Dilmun than
w as M esopotam ia. 18
It is probable that Dilmun was either a colony of the Indus
Sarasvati civilization or a vitally important outpost for its merchants.
The first mention of Dilmun is in a cuneiform text from Ur-nanshe,
king of Lagash, in South Babylonia. The king, who lived about 2520
B.c., notes in his inscription on the tablet that “the ships from Dilmun,
from the foreign lands, brought me wood as a tribute.” It is likely
that the source of the timber gifted to the ruler of Lagash was in fact
India, which had immense forests.
The significance of the island of Bahrain, which is smaller than
New York City, can be seen in the fact that it has more than 100,000
burial mounds (tum uli)— from thirteen to sixty-six feet in diameter
each covering a stone-built burial chamber containing only a single
body, together with funerary offerings. Dilmun, or Bahrain, was re
garded as a sacred land by the ancients, and many undertook the
long pilgrimage from Mesopotamia and Arabia to be buried there.
Sadly, over the centuries, grave robbers emptied the chambers, so
that they yield few finds. Fortunately, however, only a handful of the
mounds have been excavated, so that there may still be wonderful
surprises in store for archaeologists.
The great Sumerologist Samuel Noah Kramer remained skeptical
about the placement of Dilmun in Bahrain. He favored a different
118 H IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



location. stating that "there is e v e n some possibility that Dilmun may
turn out to include the region in Pakistan and India where a remark
able urban, literate culture flourished toward the end of the third
millennium B .c ., the so-called Harappan, or Indus Valley, culture."19
His main argument is that the Sumerian texts generally refer to the
blessed land of Dilmun as “the place where the sun rises," which
does not fit the island of Bahrain, located to the south of Sumer.
Kramer equated Dilmun with what the Sumerian scriptures call
“The Cedar Land," arguing that it lay east of the kingdom of Elam.
The solar deity Utu is said to rise there. Curiously, in Sanskrit, the
word udu means “star," with u du -pati designating the moon. The
Vedic solar deity is Surya, who is understandably described in rather
similar terms to Utu. In particular, both deities seem to be associated
with a predatory bird. On one Sumerian cylinder seal, Utu is shown
rising between two mountains, with flames emerging behind him.
On his right a winged being (identified as the Goddess Inanna/Ishtar)
can be seen hovering in the sky. To his left is a hawklike or eaglelike
creature. In the Rig- Veda, significantly, Surya is often symbolized as
a bird and is called “fine-winged” (su -p arn a ). He too is associated
with the primal mountain (or mountains).
Wherever Dilmun's location may turn out to be, as Kramer
stressed, it “is not just a literary fiction, a never- never land created
by the fertile imagination of the Sumerian bards and poets.”20 Th e
countty's name appears too frequently in the Sumerian and Akkadian
tablets, recording incoming shipments o f timber, gold, copper, lapis
lazuli, ivory, and other valuable commodities.
Equally historical are Meluhha and Magan (or Makan) mentioned
in the cuneiform texts, though their identity is even less certain than
that of Dilmun. 21 Some authorities have located Magan as far south
as the Sudan or Ethiopia. The consensus of scholarly opinion identi
fies this country, which was the source of much of Mesopotamia's
copper, as Oman at the bottom of the Arabian peninsula. There cop
per mines were worked as early as the fifth millennium B.c. Recently,
an inscription in the Harappan script has been found at Ras al-Junayz
on the Omani coast. Because of the intensive copper export, the mem
bers of the Omani elite were incredibly wealthy, which may have
THE LAND OF THE SEVEN RIVERS || 119



attracted the attention of the maritime merchants from the Indus and
Sarasvati Rivers.
Meluhha (or Melukhkha) has been identified with eastern Iran
and western Afghanistan or, what is more likely, with the Harappan
civilization or its southernmost province bordering on the Arabian
Sea. The Mesopotamian texts specify Meluhha as the source of its
imported carnelian, which is a beautiful mineral of translucent red
color. This helpful hint narrows down the choice to what is today
Rajputana, which is exactly the area of the former Sarasvati River
and the present-day Thar Desert.
The cuneiform texts also mention the import of tables and multi
colored ivory birds from Meluhha, and the materials from which these
exports were fashioned was available in ample quantities in the Indus
Sarasvati civilization.
The emerging scenario is of the early Indic peoples as skilled
seafarers and enterprising merchants. Maritime trade seems to have
been one of the foundations of their economy. The Mesopotamian
records speak of ships from Meluhha bringing wealth to the people
o f the Tigris and Euphrates, never o f their own ships heading east
ward. It appears that the early Indic civilization in the third and early
second millennia played a role similar to the Phoenicians in the first
millennium B .c . It will be remembered that the Phoenicians were not
only skillful merchants, whose ships sailed the world's oceans, but
also the inventors of the alphabetic script of twenty-two letters. The
merchants of the Harappan civilization probably exported the same
goods that the earlier merchants of Mehrgarh traded overland with
countries to the west. The main export article to Mesopotamia was
probably cotton which was cultivated in India already in the seventh
millennium B .c .

If the Vedic peoples and the Indus-Sarasvati civilization were
entirely different cultures, we would expect to find few, ifany, paral
lels between their religious worlds, as they can be reconstructed from
the archaeological and textual evidence. But this is not at all the
120 H IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE LAND OF THE SEVEN RIVERS H 121
case. On the contrary, when we look closely enough, we find an
abundance of significant overlap. Even those researchers who dis
miss the notion that the Vedic people may have lived peaceably with
their Harappan neighbors or, as we and several other scholars claim,
were in fact one and the same people, have often remarked on the
astonishing parallels between Indus artifacts and Vedic scriptural
testimony.
What do we know about the Indus religion? The honest answer
must be not very much, and what we know is largely inferred from
the artifacts. Most researchers are agreed that, in the words of the
British archaeologist Stuart Piggott, there is “more than a hint that
the priesthood of some religion played a very important part in the
regulation of Harappa economy from within the walls of the citadels
of the two capital cities. ”22 A similar emphasis on the priesthood is
also found in the Vedic literature and is central to Hinduism.
The numerous clay figurines of mostly nude women suggest to
most scholars the presence of a Mother Goddess cult, which would
have played a part in household shrines rather than public temples.
A representation of a female from whose womb a plant issues
strengthens this idea of a Goddess responsible for fecundity. Such
Goddesses are common in rural Hinduism even today. Goddesses are
even mentioned in many hymns of the R i g - V e d a , thus clearly con
tradicting popular scholarly opinion, which characterizes the Vedic
religion as male oriented. Much of this view came from a lack of
understanding of Vedic Sanskrit in which words with feminine case
endings, which are nearly as numerous as masculine words, often
refer to Goddesses.
There are several steatite representations o fa horned male deity,
seated in a yogilike position on a podium and surrounded by wild
beasts. Art historian Stella Kramrisch made the following observa
tion about this seal:

Kramrisch particularly emphasizes the figure’s bovine facial fea
tures reminiscent o f a mask. Almost all researchers see in this figure
a prototype of the great Hindu deity Shiva Pashupati, who is Lord of
the Beasts and archetypal yogi. Rudra/Shiva is the most prominent
deity o f the Yajur- Veda, perhaps linking the Harappan religion with
this later Vedic text. However, other Vedic deities, like Indra, Agni,
and Soma, also are sometimes called Lord of the Beasts and many
are given the epithet “bull" (vrisha).
Polished stones of up to two feet long and pierced stones have
been taken to represent male and female generative organs respec
tively— linga andyoni. And this affords another remarkable conti
nuity in religious imagery and pre
sumably ritual, notably in the tradi
tion of Tantrism. Worship by means
of standing stones and pillars is a
common feature of Vedic religion and
the religions of many other ancient
civilizations. Some scholars see in the
mortar and pestlelike som a stones of
Vedic times the basis for the linga
y o n i stones of Hinduism.
There also is evidence of the prac
tice of what has been mislabelled “tree
worship” in Harappan times, for one

which is still regarded as a sacred tree and is mentioned as such in
the R ig- Veda (l.24; 1.164) and also in the A tharva- Veda (IV.37; V.5;
X IX .31). The ritual worship, o f course, relates not to the tree but to

the spirit or deity associated with the tree. We will say more about
this particular seal in the next chapter.
Numerous seals depict a variety of animals, which may have held
a sacred significance for the Harappans. Piggott singled out the
humped or Brahma bull (Bos indicus), a
species that is allowed to roam freely and
unmolested in India's villages and towns
even today. He also mentions animals
standing in front of “mangers." The Indic
scholar I. Mahadevan has furnished an
ingenious interpretation for those im
ages.24 He believes that the mangers were
sacred devices for filtering the Vedic am
brosia (som a) , which played a crucial role
in the ancient Vedic rituals. The animal
in front of the filter is usually a humpless
bull (possibly a descendant of Bos prim i
gen ias) portrayed with a single horn, which has often been called a
unicorn. The large forward-pointing horn is vety probably the result
of the bull’s portrayal in profile, which conceals the second horn. The
bull symbolizes the Vedic ambrosial draught, which in the Rig- Veda
is frequently compared to a bull.
Some scholars think that none of the archaeological buildings
can positively be identified as temples. But recently two archaeolo
gists have plausibly argued that one of the larger buildings at
Mohenjo-Daro, with a central courtyard and symmetrically arranged
rooms, was used as a fire temple.25
In his book P rehistoric India, Piggott expressed the consensus of
scholarly opinion at the time when he noted that possibly Hindu
society owed more to Harappa than to the Sanskrit-speaking invad
ers. Yet he, and others, conveniently overlooked the fact that there is
nothing in the above catalogue of religious elements that would irre
futably demonstrate that the Harappans and the Vedic Aryans were
entirely different cultures.
On the other hand, when we drop the Aryan invasion model, we
find that there is in fact good reason to assume the identity of the

Indus-Sarasvati civilization with the Vedic culture. In that case, the
alleged survivals in Hinduism of symbolic elements and ritual prac
tices from the “pre-Aryan Harappans" turn out to be simple continu
ities within the same civilization. In other words, Harappan tree wor
ship or the Mother Goddess cult did not surreptitiously sneak into
Hinduism but have been an integral part of the Hindu religion since
ancient times. We also want to emphasize that the Vedas preserve
the priestly religion of the times. One would expect that the common
people may have entertained slightly divergent beliefs and practices,
as they do in rural India today.
There is strong supportive evidence for the Vedic nature of the
Indus-Sarasvati civilization. This concerns the fire altars found at
several Indus sites. It must be appreciated that at the core of the
Vedic religion is sacrifice. It was thought to duplicate the cosmic pro
cess itself, since all things of the world are sacrificed in the fire of
time. Sacrifice, however, involves ritual and, for the Vedic priests,
ritual meant the construction of altars out of bricks. Sun-dried or
burnt bricks were common in the Indus-Sarasvati towns.
The Vedic altar was regarded as a miniature representation of
the cosmos and was assembled piece by piece. The single most im
portant sacrificial ritual in Vedic times and later was the fire ritual
(agn i-shtom a or ag n i-h otra). The Vedic literature is pervaded by a
rich mythological symbolism revolving around the central notion of
the sacrificial fire, which was understood to be a representation of
the sun and, by further extension, of the blinding radiance of the
transcendental reality.
Sacrificial altars have been excavated in Indus towns over a
large area, from Baluchistan in the west to Uttar Pradesh in the east
and Gujarat in the south. In the citadel at the site of Kalibangan,
which lies at the confluence of the famous Sarasvati and Drishadvati
Rivers of Vedic lore, seven rectangular fire altars were found. They
stood in a row, aligned north-south, beside a well. This parallels the
six Vedic d h ish n y a hearths that are lined up in the same way; the
seventh hearth could be one of the additional hearths used for clean
ing the ritual implements. Circular and ovoid altars also have been
discovered. Some of them contained the ashes of charcoal and of
124 H IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



ferings of beads and gold. One altar has five layers, just as a Vedic
fire altar would.
When we assemble all the available pieces of the puzzle, we ob
tain a discernable pattern— not yet complete but certainly adequate
enough to demand a new way of looking at India's ancient history.
When we look with open eyes and an open mind at the puzzle, as it
slowly but surely is emerging from piecemeal archaeological recon
struction, we find increasing certainty that the Indus-Sarasvati civi
lization was not pre-Atyan but essentially Vedic.
There is nothing in the Rig-V eda that starkly contradicts what
we know about ancient India from the archaeological excavations.
On the contrary, there are many parallels in geography, culture, and
chronology between the Vedic society, as mirrored in the hymns, and
the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, as reflected in the archaeological
artifacts. These two bodies of evidence strongly suggest the conclu
sion that the two civilizations were one and the same. In other words,
we may with reasonable certainty assume that the Indus-Sarasvati
civilization was thoroughly Vedic or, conversely, that the R ig- Veda
and the other related sacred hymns, were the product of the religious
genius of the people who created the urban civilization o f the Land
of the Seven Rivers.

hymnodies are traditionally regarded as "superhu
man" knowledge, revealed by seer-sages (rish i) in a
heightened state of awareness. The four sacred Vedic
collections were from the beginning orally transmit
ted within priestly families. Some brahmins were able to memorize
the thousands of verses of only one Vedic hymnody; others, two,
three, or all four—a truly astounding feat.
Because of this emphasis on oral transmission and the absence
ofancient written records, some scholars have assumed that the Vedic
peoples were illiterate. In the preceding chapters, we have shown
that we are no longer justified in differentiating the Vedic Aryans
from the creators of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization. They were one
and the same people. Of course, not everyone lived in the towns
along the Indus and Sarasvati Rivers and their many tributaries. On
the contrary, as in modern India, the majority of the Vedic population
probably lived in small villages scattered throughout the counttyside
wherever there was soil fertile enough to grow barley and other crops
and to pasture cattle. These villagers, then as now, very likely could
neither read nor write.
But the Vedic city dwellers were probably a literate or at least semi
literate folk. To be sure, the presence of a strong oral tradition does
not preclude literacy. On the contrary, it may show a concern with

faithfulness in the transmission of knowl
edge, which requires something more, not
less, than the written word. Evidence for
writing in Vedic times is found in an over
looked reference in the Rig- Veda (X.62.
7) itself. Here the strange compound
ash ta-kam y ah , or “eight-eared," is ap
plied to cattle. This phrase has generally
been understood in the sense of “broad
eared" or “fully grown." However, more
likely it refers to cattle that had their ears
branded or marked with the numeral
eight. The symbolic significance of eight
is not clear, though the numeral is rarely
mentioned in the Rig- Veda.
There also is a fascinating state
ment in the A tharva-V eda (XIX.72.1)
that the Veda is to be replaced in the chest
(kosh a) from which it was taken. Ad
mittedly, this particular Vedic hymnody
is somewhat younger than the Rig-Veda,
but it still belongs to the era coinciding
with the last phase of the Indus cities.
Although the memory of the ancients
appears to have been phenomenal, it is
nonetheless difficult to believe that the
massive corpus of Vedic literature was
transmitted by oral tradition alone, with
out the help of written documents. In this
regard we must note that the Vedas com
monly speak o f the “word” that is seen
as well as heard, as for instance in the
R ig -Veda (X.71.4). While this has been
taken to imply intellectual seeing (or un
derstanding) , we cannot rule out the pos
sibility of the written word.



DECIPHERING THE INDUS-SARASVATI SCRIPT
Thus the Vedic poet-seers are often said to fashion or carve their
hymns like a craftsman does a chariot. 1This fashioning or caiving
the verbal root taksh is used—need not be a poetic metaphor only
but could refer to actual writ
composition.
The bards knew no fewer fig. 2 7 . Sanskrit text e f thefamous than fifteen distinct meters, gayatri-mantra.
though employed only seven
of these frequently. Approximately one quarter of the total number
of verses in the R ig- Veda are composed in the g a y a tri meter, which
has three sections of eight syllables each, the first four syllables of
which are free while the last four have a prescribed cadence. This
meter derives its name from the most famous Vedic mantra, which
reads tat savitur varenyam , bh arg o devasya dhim ahi, d h iy o y o nah
pracodayat. In English translation, this sacred utterance means, “Let
us contemplate the beautiful splendor of God Savitri, that he may
inspire our visions.” To this day, pious Hindus recite this mantra at
dawn and at dusk to receive the blessings of the divine Light mani
festing in the luminous orb o f the sun.
The Taittiriya-Sam hita (V.2.8) of the Yqjur-Veda speaks of the
"divine sign" (deva-lakshm an) that is written threefold (try-alikhita),
which could well be a reference to the sacred sign om , which has
three constituent parts. In some old rites, the syllable om has to be
written out on the ground or traced in water—a tradition that may
have had its origin in Vedic times.
The Shukla-Y ajur-V eda (XV11.2) mentions the names for num
bers from 1Oto t ,0 0 0,000,000,000. Mathematics involving such large
numbers is impossible without some form of written annotation. In

script, the Vedic poets would
have found it exceedingly dif
ficult to meet the rigorous
standards of Sanskrit metric



tian Middle Ages were notoriously averse to long strings o f numer
als and would have been horrified at the familiarity with which the
Indic peoples and the Mesopotamians, as well as the Maya, handled
large numbers.
Furthermore, the geometric design of the Vedic fire altar involved
mathematical calculations that could not possibly be done in the head,
unless we assume the priests were id iot savan ts in the field of arith
metic. The Vedic astrologers, too, had to resort to writing in order to
cast their horoscopes. If we grant the Vedic peoples the ability to
write numerals, we should also entertain the possibility that they
or an elite group—were literate.
In any case, writing in Sanskrit is not the late invention it has
always been considered to be. The A itareya-A ranyaka (V.3.3), which
is more than three thousand years old, clearly refers to writing. Sev
eral U panishads describe various aspects of the alphabet. What is
more, ancient India produced the most extensive grammatical sci
ence the world has known until twentieth-century linguistics. Al
though the genius grammarian Panini is thought to have lived around
5 0 0 B.c., it is unlikely that such a sophisticated tradition could have
arisen in the absence of writing, or by a culture that was only newly
literate (as the Aryan invasion theory requires).
As in later times, writing was probably executed on highly per
ishable material, such as palm leaves or wood (birch bark). Given
the remoteness of the Vedic age and India's climate, it should not
come as a surprise that no books from that early period have sur
vived. The same holds true of other ancient civilizations, apart from
texts etched in stone. What is truly curious is that while scholars
have tended to give credence to traditions about lost texts from an
cient Greece and Rome, they have generally dismissed similar tradi
tions among the Hindus. For example, the great grammarian Panini
himself mentions a number of grammatical works prior to his date,
showing that he came at the end of a long line o f development rather
than the beginning. Yet some scholars have refused to take Panini
seriously on this. Also, the M ahabharata epic speaks of lost Vedas
apart from the four hymnodies that have survived the vicissitudes
of time.

DECIPHERING THE INDUS-SARASVATI SCRIPT 131
The Language o f th e Seals
Turning to the archaeological evidence from M ohenjo-Daro,
Harappa, and other sites, there are around 4 ,2 0 0 inscribed objects,
many of which are duplicates. These are mainly carvings on seals,
small pieces of soft stone, and a few copper tablets. They reveal a
surprisingly mature system of writing, quite distinct from the scripts
of Sumer and pharaonic Egypt.
There are close to four hundred different signs, including nu
merals as well as conjuncts of more basic signs. Most texts are very
brief, the average length being five signs. The longest text, on a three
sided amulet, is only twenty-six signs long. The longest inscription
on a single side is seventeen signs, extending over three lines on a
seal. This severe brevity of the available texts has greatly hampered
the efforts at decipherment.
While the inscribed copper tablets may have been worn as amu
lets, the steatite seals appear to have served primarily as marks of
ownership. A large number of seal impressions on clay also have
survived. These are likely to have served as tags that were attached
to bales of goods, for the reverse sides often show traces of packing
materials.
Thus, as in other civilizations of that formative period, writing
appears to have been principally connected with commercial life.
However, the absence of written documents of a religious nature does
not necessarily mean that writing was deemed unfit as a medium for
the communication of deeper knowledge. It is generally believed that
the sacred lore was not put down in writing until post-Vedic times.
The spiritual knowledge was then, as it is today, communicated by
word of mouth. Millennium after millennium, the sacred tradition
was faithfully handed down from teacher to disciple by oral trans
mission. Even today, with the Vedic texts readily available in critical
editions, this time-honored custom is followed in parts of India. Yet,
as we have noted, the sacred knowledge was very probably not ex
clusively entrusted to human memory, however prodigious, but we
no longer have actual written texts from that early period. Neverthe
less, the proven fidelity of the orally transmitted Vedas allows us to

look upon them as artifacts equal, for instance, to the Pyramid Texts
of ancient Egypt or the Sumerian king lists inscribed on clay tablets.
The pictorial motifs that accompany the writing on the seals in
clude the humped bull, humpless bull, water buffalo, elephant, tiger,
rhinoceros, crocodile, antelope, fish, and tortoise. Geometric designs
include the sv a stika (a solar symbol), spoked wheel, and a circle
with a dot. These pictures are similar to the ones that show up on
seals two thousand years later.
Indian scholars like Fateh Singh have pointed out many striking
parallels between the Indus-Sarasvati pictures and Vedic images.3
We already mentioned the much-debated Pashupati seal that ex
presses many attributes c f Shiva. Another well-known seal shows
two birds looking up from opposite sides of the branches of an
ash v atth a (sacred fig) tree. In a riddle-filled hymn of the Rig- Veda
(1.164.20), the seer-bard speaks of two birds, “friends joined to
gether," who are perched on a tree. One bird is tasting the tree’s
sweet fruit, while the other simply looks on. This striking image has
elicited many different interpretations from scholars. According to
some researchers, it expresses a key Vedic idea: that the individual
spirit and the universal spirit both
are of the same essence.
The most common Indus
Sarasvati seal image is that of a
single-horned animal, which some
have identified as a humpless bull.
However, this identification is far
from certain. The creature is drawn
in such a way that we must assume
either that the craftsmanship is in
ferior to the realistic depictions on
the other seals or that the figure is
a composite creature of mythology.
The latter interpretation is prefer
able, because if the creature does indeed represent a unicorn, we
have a direct link to the Vedic heritage. First of all, the notion of the
animal with the single horn—the e k a -s h lin g a -o c c urs relatively of
Fig. 28. The bull-unicom is afrequent motjffound on Harappan seals.



DECIPHERING THE INDUS-SARASVATI SCRIPT
ten in the later Hindu literature. 4The strange-looking elongated body
o f the creature could conceivably be a composite of bull and horse, in
which case we can see in it a representation o f God Indra as Vri
shashvapati. The name
m eans literally “Lord
(pati) ofthe bull-horse."
In Vedic m ythology,
Vrishashva (bull-horse)
-f r o m vrisha (“bull")
and ash v a (“horse")
is Indra’s mount.
Bull and horse are
symbols of fertility
both on the m aterial
plane and the psychic
or spiritual level. More
particularly, the bull is
a symbol of the sacred
som a draught, which is
the gateway to the luminous world o f the deities and the Divine
itself. In one hymn o f the R ig-V eda (IX .3.3), the sacred soma is said
to be adorned by the priestly chants as a horse for battle. In another
hymn of the Rig-V eda (IX .13.6). the soma juices flowing through
the filter into the receptacle are likened to horses urged to battle.
One hymn (1.164.35) speaks o f the soma as the semen o f the stal
lion. Elsewhere in the Rig-V eda (IX .21.4), the dripping soma juices
are compared to horses harnessed to a cart, since they bring all
kinds o f desired blessings. Thus we have a direct connection be
tween the bull as a light-bringer and the horse as a swift carrier of
good fortune.
Both bull and horse, moreover, are associated with the sun, as is
the soma juice, or heavenly ambrosia. The sun itself is a visible sym
bol for the Light beyond. Thus we have a whole cycle o f symbolic
associations. Bereft o f the wisdom of the ancients, we can barely
comprehend the thoughtful connections and magical correlations with
which the creators of the Vedic hymnodies were thoroughly familiar.

We can, however, glimpse enough o f their worldview to appreciate
that the symbolism found on the soapstone seals does not contradict
what we encounter in the V e d a s but, on the contrary, seems to match
it well enough.
In another much-discussed seal, we see a horned figure stand
ing amidst a bifurcated tree. To the left is a kneeling figure with arms
extended forward in a prayerful or invocatory gesture. Behind it is a
creature with curved horns ex
tending sideways, which some
scholars have seen as a bull,
others as a goat. Below this
scene is a row of seven figures
standing upright, shown in
frontal view. Each figure wears
a long tuft of hair draped over
the left shoulder and a pecu
liar headdress. The horned fig
ure standing in the tree is very
probably a deity, and the eight
other human figures could be
the seven sacrificial priests as
sociated with some Vedic ritu
als (as mentioned in R i g - V e d a
IX. 10.7; 15.8), with the eighth figure possibly being the sponsor of
the sacrifice or the head priest. In one Rig-Vedic hymn (X. 114.9),
the composer poses this riddle:
W h a t s a g e k n o w s t h e a p p lic a t io n (yoga) e f t h e m e t e r s ? W h o
u tte r s t h e w o r d s a p p r o p r ia t e t o t h e .fu n c t io n s e f t h e v a r io u s

(shura) ? W h o h a s h o n o r e d I n d r a ' s [ t w o ] s t e e d s ?
The Indian scholar P. V. Pathak offered a divergent and quite
intriguing interpretation for the symbolism of this seal. which dem
onstrates the tentative nature of all such explanations.5 He related
the seal to a motif found in the A t h a r v a - V e d a (IV.3 7). This particular
hymn was chanted to drive away malevolent spirits, and the plant

in India. Indic scripts have undergone continual change for centuries
and by medieval times the earliest scripts had been quite forgotten.
One of these scripts, Brahmi, was used by the Buddhist emperor
Ashoka in the third century b .c. to inscribe his edicts on stone pillars
around the length and breadth of India. Brahmi was deciphered by
James Prinsep in 1837, and the language on the edicts turned out to
be a Prakrit dialect. Some authorities have suggested a Semitic ori
gin for the Brahmi alphabet, but current evidence clearly shows that
it is a descendant o f the Indus-Sarasvati script.
In Brahmi, as in later Indic scripts, each letter represents a con
sonant combined with the vowel a. Combinations with other vowels
are represented by the use of distinctive marks which modify the
basic sign. 1\.vo consonants together were expressed by placing the
signs for the two one on top of the other. This process of combination
yields a total of 3 3 0 distinctive Brahmi signs for the 33 consonants
alone, without taking into account any consonant conjuncts. In light
of the theory put forward in this book, it is not surprising that the
Indus-Sarasvati inscriptions should turn out to have a total of about
4 0 0 signs. Moreover, many of these signs appear to be modified in
exactly the same regular manner as in the much later Brahmi script.
It is logical to assum e that a systematically designed script such
as Brahmi would represent a simplification of an earlier script. More
over, with the parallel of ancient Egyptian writing in mind, one may
further assum e that, in addition to the phonetic signs, the ancestor
of Brahmi probably included logograms as well as determinatives.
A logogram is a single sign for a word, while determinatives are
signs added to the logogram to qualify it in some fashion. In an
cient Egyptian, for instance, the determinatives indicate grammati
cal categories; thus an egg shape following a name indicates a femi
nine name, and a name in a cartouche represents royalty. Assum
ing the Indus-Sarasvati script to be the ancestor of Brahmi, one
would expect a core syllabary together with many logograms and
other signs. The decipherment would best proceed by concentrating
on this syllabary first.
We may add that pottery marks in the late second millennium
B.c. are strongly reminiscent of the Indus-Sarasvati signs. It is rea

sonable to assume that this was the period when the logosyllabic
Indus-Sarasvati script was being reorgan ized into an early form of
the Brahmi script.

The Indus scr ipt, like hieroglyphic Egyptian, is generally written
from right to left, in a direction opposite to that of Brahmi. On the
other hand, there are instances of both scripts being written in
boustrophedon fashion. reading alternately left to right and right to
left in successive lines. The change in the direction of writing does
indicate a fundamental shift in orientation. However, it is not clear
whether this shift occurred when the Indus-Sarasvati peoples relo
cated to the Gangetic valley after the urban collapse of 1900 B .c. or
during the urbanization that occurred around the time of the Buddha
or several centuries earlier.
In 1934, G. R. Hunter published a first study on the relationship
between the Indus-Sarasvati glyphs and the Brahmi script.1' How
ever, this significant research and also the 1978 study by J. E.
Mitchiner failed to provide conclusive proof for the existence of that
relationship.7 More recently, one of the present authors (Subhash
Kak) renewedly explored this important question from a statistical
point of view, us ing computer-created concordances .8 This analysis
has shown that the most frequent letters of the Indus-Sarasvati and



Brahmi scripts look almost identical and, moreover, share a rather
similar frequency of occurrence. The chance that this is a coincidence
is so small that one can safely say that Brahmi is derived from lndus
Sarasvati. Furthermore, a structural analysis of the inscriptions indi
cates that the texts on the steatite seals follow grammatical rules like
that of Sanskrit.
Nevertheless, one cannot claim that the script has been deciphered.
According to cryptological theory, the texts have to be much longer
than those currently available to confirm that a proposed decipher
ment is the only solution possible. The minimum size of the cipher
text necessary to validate a decipherment is called its unicity d is
tan ce. For the lndus-Sarasvati script, the texts will have to be about
twenty characters long. It appears, therefore, that a conclusive deci
pherment will have to await the discovery of longer texts. Given that
many known sites are yet to be excavated, one can be quite hopeful
that such texts will be found.
Of course, the demonstration that Brahmi is derived from the
lndus-Sarasvati script does not, by itself, establish that the urban
ites from Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were Indo-Aryan. Yet, the struc
tural similarities in the lndus-Sarasvati and the Brahmi texts do point
to that conclusion. This, in turn, reinforces the other continuities
between the Indus-Sarasvati culture and the Vedic peoples that the
archaeological discoveries of the past few decades have revealed.
Furthermore. such an explanation agrees with the independent pro
posals by Marija Gimbutas, T. V. Gamkrelidze, V. V. Ivanov, and Colin
Renfrew, who posited a dispersal of the Indo-European languages
considerably earlier than previously thought.
At the same time, we must not rule out the possibility that some
of the Harappan inscriptions may be in a non-lndo-European lan
guage, since the population was multiethnic and very probably in
cluded speakers of different languages. However, we may reason
ably assume that one language served as a lingua franca, especially
in the business community.
In any event, the relationship between the lndus-Sarasvati and
the Brahmi scripts is one more piece of evidence that interlocks with
other similar evidence from archaeology and literature linking the

civilizations of the Indus and the Ganges Rivers. It opens up a new
direction for a more rewarding study of the Indus-Sarasvati script.
New questions on the relationship between the appearance of writ
ing in Mesopotamia and the Indus-Sarasvati world also arise. Ar
chaeology is yet to unearth evidence that will allow us to reconstruct
the developmental stages of the Indus-Sarasvati script. Did it evolve
from a need for business transactions? Such transactions must have
been fundamental to the Vedic world with its extensive maritime and
overland trade. If this was the case then one can see the development
of the Mesopotamian and the Indus-Sarasvati scripts to have been
somewhat related. Another theory is that the symbols represent ar
chetypal patterns and that the development of the Indus-Sarasvati
script is to be viewed as a byproduct of spiritual practices rather than
mere commercial interactions. Later scriptures from the Indic tradi
tion subscribe to the second view.
It is not surprising that the later Indic tradition represents
Sarasvati as the Goddess oflearning. This very likely commemorates
the development of writing in the Sarasvati region. It also suggests
the possibility that the original name of the Indus-Sarasvati writing
might have been Sarasvati. The etymology of the term B rahm i, ap
plied to the script that has apparently evolved out of the Indus
Sarasvati glyphs, captures its true origin. For, in Hindu theogony,
Brahmi is the daughter of God Brahma and Goddess Sarasvati.
The D ravidian Puzzle
One of the main difficulties in interpreting the early history of
India concerns the fact that the languages of South India belong to
an entirely different linguistic group than those of the North. While
Indo-European languages prevail in the northern part of the penin
sula, Dravidian languages dominate the southern tip.
This linguistic differentiation has frequently been connected with
the ethnographic fact that skin color becomes darker as one proceeds
from north to south. The Aryan invasion theory was invented largely
to explain these racial and linguistic differences. The invading Ary
ans were deemed to constitute not only a separate language group

Dravidian, and Semitic. The word “Nostratic" was coined by the Dan
ish scholar Holger Pedersen in 1924, from the Latin n ostras mean
ing “of our country."
Significantly, when we turn to the Sanskrit and Dravidian sources,
we find that Vedic Sanskrit has affinities with Dravidian. While schol
ars have identified some twenty Dravidian “loan words" in the Rig
Veda, the Dravidian languages have “borrowed" at least fifty percent
of their vocabulaty from (Aryan) Sanskrit. Dravidian history attributes
the creation of Tamil, the oldest Dravidian tongue, to Agastya, who
figures in the Rig- Veda as one of the most prominent sages of his
era. The Dravidian kings historically have called themselves Aryans
and have traced their descent through Manu, the Hindu counterpart
of Noah who repopulated the Earth after the Great Flood. The notion
that the same culture— namely the vast and multiethnic Indus
Sarasvati civilization—could not have utilized two distinct language
systems appears to us questionable.
Apart from linguistic affinities, northern and southern India share
a common culture and religion. There have been attempts to charac
terize Shaivism (the worship of Shiva) of the South as non-Vedic or
non-Aryan. However, God Shiva clearly is synonymous with the Vedic
God Rudra, who also shares many features with other Vedic deities,
such as Agni, Indra, and Soma. Moreover, God Shiva is a deity most
closely associated with the northern river Ganges, which, according
to Hindu mythology, cascades down onto his head.
In any case. today the Dravidian invasion theory stands revealed
as a mere shadow cast by the Aryan invasion theory, which itself is
a distortion of historical actuality. We must jettison both these schol
arly models if we want to discover the truth about ancient India.

The e x ca v a tio n s a t M eh rg arh h ave yielded the a sto n ish in g ly early



date of around 6 5 0 0 B . c . This places Mehrgarh in the company of
other early settlem ents like Çatal Hüyiik in Anatolia, Jarmo in
Mesopotamia, and Jericho in Palestine.
Jericho is a site of many succeeding settlements; as many as
twenty-five strata have been identified. The earliest occupation of
this oasis has been dated back to around 9 2 0 0 B .c. when Jericho was
little more than a semipermanent camp. It took at least another mil
lennium for Jericho to become a village of little more than ten acres,
sheltering a population of around two thousand. Small by our mod
ern reckoning, Jericho was a large settlement for its time. Signifi
cantly, it was surrounded by a wall more than twelve feet high, com
plete with a tower that was over thirty-two feet in diameter and prob
ably stood all of thirty feet tall. The purpose ofeither wall or tower are
not clear. The obvious explanation that they functioned as defensive
fortifications shielding the settlement from external attacks by hos
tile tribes is not necessarily the only or best explanation. The wall, it
has been suggested, could also have served to hold back flash floods
and encroaching silt and debris from the wadi to the west of the oa
sis. The tower probably did not serve a defensive function as it is
situated inside the wall’s perimeter. However, a ritual purpose for its
existence is quite possible. At any rate, the original wall was the first
of many walls erected throughout Jericho's long existence, including
the famous wall mentioned in the Old Testament (Joshua 6:20) that is
said to have crumbled at the sound of the Israelites' trumpets.
Jarmo, which originated in the mid-seventh millennium, was a
hamlet of no more than thirty houses spread out over four acres.
Each house, built of pisé (rammed earth) walls and mud floors, con
sisted of several small rooms most of which were used for storage.
For the first five centuries of its existence, Jarmo shows no trace of
pottery making, which is regarded as an important breakthrough in
the development of human civilization. Archaeologists distinguish
between aceramic (prepottery) and ceramic (pottety) cultures. The
word ceram ic comes from the Greek term keram os, referring to' potter’s
clay. This clay is hardened by being baked in the sun or by being fired
in a kiln. The inhabitants of early Jarmo used stone vessels and bas
kets lined with asphalt instead. Later generations knew how to fash

ion simple clay pottery. Jarmo is considered a typical transitional site
between the hunting- and-gathering lifestyle of the Paleolithic (Old
Stone Age) and the sedentary lifestyle of the Neolithic (New Stone
Age), supported by agriculture and the domestication o f livestock.
Of the three contemporaneous settlements mentioned above, only
Çatal Hüyük is roughly comparable to the sixth-millennium Mehrgarh
in size and significance, and we will address this fascinating cultural
parallel shortly. First, however, we need to capture the fact that the
date of 6 5 0 0 B.c. falls into the early Neolithic, which marks the crucial
transition from the nomadic or se minomadic life of hunters and gath
erers to the sedentary life of agriculturists. The discovery of Mehrgarh
considerably broadened our understanding of the Neolithic. An article
published in S d e n t j f i c A m e r ic a n summarized the new view thus:
A lr e a d y M e h rg a r h q fe r s p r o q f o f t h e e x is te n c e o f a n e a r ly
a g r ic u ltu r a l c e n te r c lo s e to t h e In d u s v a lle y a n d s tr o n g ly s u p

t e r in w estern A s ia . '
In other words, the Neolithic revolution was not confined to the
Fertile Crescent, the narrow area of the Near East—to settlements
like Jericho, Jarmo, and Çatal Hüyük. Nor was Gordon Childe, who
coined the concept of a “Neolithic revolution," correct in stating that
this was followed by an “urban revolution." For, Mehrgarh is proof
that large settlements—which we could call towns—existed already
at the opening of the Neolithic age. These served as a prototype for
the splendid cities of a later era, such as the large urban environ
ments of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. The existence of early settle
ments like Mehrgarh is yet another indication that we must com
pletely revise our opinion about the level of civilization that existed
eight or nine thousand years ago.

THE NEOLITHIC TOWN OF MEHRGARH 147
At the end of the last Ice Age,
around 1 0 ,0 0 0 b .c., the total world
population is estimated as having
been around four million. At that
time, India is thought to have had a
population of only 1 0 0 ,0 0 0 indi
viduals. Nor do we have any reason
to assume that there was any sig
nificant population increase during
the interim until the opening of the
Neolithic period. By the time Mehr
garh was a thriving town in the sixth
millennium B .c ., India’s population
might have num bered around
250,000. Three thousand years later,
during the Harappan era, India’s
population has been calculated at
five million. Today it is nearly one
billion!
A rchaeologists found many
burial grounds between the build
ings o f Mehrgarh and inferred from
the number of burials that this town
was densely populated. Possibly we
can raise the figure to twenty-five
thousand individuals. This is not the size o f a mere village but that
of a town. Depending on our definition, Mehrgarh might even qualify
as a city.
To place this finding into proper perspective, one must know that
the settlements in the preceding period were seldom larger than six
or seven acres. Also, the houses were still round— in imitation of the
caves o f the Paleolithic— and usually dug out of a hillside and then
covered with branches and hides. The oldest known house, at the
site of Ein Guev on the river Jordan in what is now Syria, is dated
between 14,000 B .c . and 1 2 ,000 B .c . This architectural style has been
traced down to about 8 0 0 0 B .c. Thereafter, rectangular construction



became the norm in most cultures of the world, suggesting a corre
sponding radical shift in consciousness.4
At the Mehrgarh site, the earliest level of inhabitation is com
posed of rectangular buildings fashioned from mud bricks—the uni
versal building material in that part of the w orld-and contains be
tween four and six symmetrical rooms each. As in the earlier round
house time, the buildings formed clusters, and each cluster was prob
ably inhabited by members of the same family group.
Over the centuries, life in India—as elsewhere—became increas
ingly complex. For that early period, this complexification can best
be seen in pottery changes. No pottery has been found at the oldest
level of occupation at Mehrgarh. When pottery first made its appear
ance at Mehrgarh, it was rather rough. However, before long it made
way for glossy red wares of a finer quality. Then, during the fifth
millennium B .c ., simple geometric patterns were first applied. By the
end of that millennium, pottery showed complex animal decorations
and was expertly thrown on the wheel.
The use of the potter's wheel and also of bow drills more than six
thousand years ago underscore the impre ssion that Mehrgarh was a
center of technological creativity and innovation, as well as a thriv
ing marketplace for imported and exported goods. The town had many
buildings with storage rooms and workrooms for artisans like pot
ters, bead makers, basket makers, and stonemasons.
The people of Mehrgarh had domesticated cattle in addition to
sheep, goats, and possibly water buffalo. Cattle has always been
thought to have been introduced into India by the invading Aryans
in the second millennium B .c. The new evidence shows that domes
tication of cattle occurred in Mehrgarh earlier than other ancient settle
ments of western Asia. Moreover, there is evidence that cattle were
more significant to Mehrgarh’s inhabitants than any other large do
mesticated animals—a cultural trait that has been preserved over
thousands of years down to present-day Hinduism.
As the Indian historian Romila Thapar observed, for the Vedic
Aryans the cow “was the measure of value and was a vety precious
commodity. "5 Pertinent as Thapar’s remarks are, they are far too ab
stract to convey to our modern urban intelligence the central impor

sight into the nature of existence.
Given the dominant role that cattle played in the daily life of the
people of Mehrgarh, we feel justified in speculating that cattle also
figured prominently in their symbolism and mythology. In that event,
we may trace a direct line of development from Mehrgarh to Mohenjo
Daro and the Rig-Veda.
Mehrgarh’s craftsmen mass-produced pottery in the early fourth
millennium and at least by the early third millennium exported their
ware to eastern Iran. There was extensive trading in the fourth mil
lennium and possibly earlier. In th e past, scholars typically under
estimated the communication between settlements and between cul
tures. All the recent evidence from around the world, however,
obliges us to think of our Neolithic ancestors as having been rather
communicative and mobile. Trading was as essential to them as it
is to us moderns, and business seems to have been the catalyst for
a number of important cultural innovations, not the least of which
was writing. The people of Mehrgarh imported jade and turquoise
from Central Asia, lapis lazuli from northern Afghanistan, fuchsite
(a jadelike material) from the south of India, shells from the coast
of the Arabian Sea, and no doubt a good many other products from
elsewhere.
The trade routes were unquestionably also the routes along which
ideas flowed from one culture to another. The populations of many
of the early Neolithic sites, such as Mehrgarh or Çatal Hüyük in
Anatolia, were surprisingly multiracial—again showing that distance
was not the obstacle that scholars have been prone to assume. Large
villages and towns were attracting a variety of people, just as today’s
sprawling urban environments are exerting a strong pull on those
seeking work or diversion.
Remarkably, cotton was cultivated by the Mehrgarh formers as
early as the fifth millennium B.c., either for its oil content or its fiber.
Although no weaving utensils have been found so for, this does not
exclude the possibility that cotton was used to make clothes. Some
150 @ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



scholars think that India was very likely the birthplace of the fine art
of weaving. The oldest textile fragments belong to the Harappan
period, but the art of weaving could have been invented well before
then.
In what scholars label " period VU” at Mehrgarh, corresponding
to 2 6 0 0 B .c ., the excavations indicate the large-scale production of
pots. From that period also, larger numbers of human figurines have
survived. Most of them are female statuettes, some wearing elabo
rate hairdos. The male figurines typically sport a turban, which pro
vides an incredible continuity with the customary modern headgear
in that region.
Three primitively fashioned human figurines, made out of unfired
clay, were found already at the oldest level at Mehrgarh. We must
assume that they were not the only ones crafted, either at that time
or in the immediately succeeding centuries. But human representa
tion was probably rare until later. At any rate, the three artifacts “are
the earliest figurines yet discovered in southern A sia."7Another first
for Mehrgarh.
Most of the later stylized female figurines, made out of terra
cotta, are in a seated position. From about 3 0 0 0 B .c. on, the female
figurines underwent a stylistic change. Now the legs were encircled
by a coil, the faces became goggle-eyed and bordered by coils resem
bling elaborate hair dresses, and the breasts became pendulous. A
few hundred years later, the standing position became more frequent,
and male figurines appear in larger numbers. There is an ongoing
debate about whether such figurines were toys or cult objects, not
only at Mehrgarh but in other cultures as well. The latter explanation
seems more plausible, as children's toys were probably improvised
from bits of wood and other readily available material.
Terra-cotta is a brownish-red mixture of clay and sand, which is
hardened by fire. It was also used, in addition to bone, to make the
first stamp seals in that area. The later seals in the urban centers
were fashioned from soapstone (steatite). The small round seals were
pressed into soft sealing material to mark someone’s property. These
stamp seals appear to be an original invention of India. However,
the Sumerians may claim the innovation of the cylinder seal, which

WhytheAryanInvasionNeverHappened:
SeventeenArguments
The F acts Sp eak for T h em selves
W E HAVE COVERED ENORMOUS GROUND IN TH E P R E
ceding chapters—from the rediscovery of the sa
cred canon of the Hindus to the discrediting of the
Aryan invasion theory, to the discovery of the
Indus and Sarasvati towns and villages and the
likely geological and environmental cause o f their demise, and fi
nally to the archaeological surprise of the large Neolithic town of
Mehrgarh.
In this chapter we return to the core argument of the first part of
this book, which is the dismissal of the long-standing scholarly be
lief that the Vedic Aryans entered India from outside and demolished
the so-called Harappan civilization. As we have shown, far from be
ing the nemesis of the Indus cities, as most scholars have assumed,
the Vedic Aryans were in fact their builders and inhabitants. In this
connection it is surely not without deeper significance that the mac
rocosmic archetype of the human being is called pu ru sha in the R ig
Veda (X .90; X .130) and later literature. For the word p u r means
“town" and u sha can be derived from the verbal root vas, meaning
“to dwell" or “to exist." 1Thus the purusha— whether on the macro
cosmic or the human level—means “he who dwells in the town.”
Town-dwelling is thus deemed a primary characteristic o f human



kind, which supports the evidence for the Aryans’ civilized way of
life depicted in the Rig- V e d a .
In order to penetrate archaic symbolism further, we can note that
the word p u r is derived from the verbal root p r i , meaning “to be
full." Thus the Cosmic M a n -a n d , as a reflection, the human being
on Earth— is a dweller in fullness. We may interpret this to refer to
both the plenitude of the world at large (which is the creation of the
Cosmic Man by an act of self-sacrifice) and also the plenty of earthly
towns. In the latter instance, plenty can signal both material wealth
and multitudinous population, which was probably considered a boon
rather than a curse in those days.
Because our reasons for rejecting the Aryan invasion theory are
very complex—indeed more complex than can be fully documented
in a book intended for a lay readership—we thought it desirable to
furnish an overview of our basic arguments to round off this first
part of our consideration.
First Argum ent: The Aryan invasion model is largely based on lin
guistic conjectures, which, in turn, are founded in archaeological
speculations that have been shown to be misguided. As Sri Aurobindo,
one of the great spiritual luminaries of modern India, noted in his
thoughtful book O n t h e Veda:
T h e h y p o th e s is , in v e n te d t o f i l l th e g a p , t h a t th e s e id e a s [ o f
t h e s e c r e t t e a c h i n g s e f t h e Upanishads] w e r e b o r r o w e d b y

Aurobindo was right, of course, as is clear from the following
remarks by the British archaeologist Colin Renfrew:

as an assumption of the invasion theory that is not warranted by a
more critical reading of the texts, which show cities as an integral
part of the Vedic culture.
Sixth Argument: The Aryan invasion of India was widely thought
to have been made possible by the use of horse-drawn chariots, as in
the case of the invasions of the Middle East by other Indo-European
speakers in the late second millennium B .c . It was also thought that
horses were unknown in the Indus civilization. This later assump
tion has meantime been proved wrong, for there is evidence for the
presence of horses in a number of Harappan and pre-Harappan sites.
In addition, recently discovered depictions of horses in Paleolithic
caves show that the horse was present in India even before the Indus
towns were built. Horseback riding has until recently been deemed a
relatively late invention. However, evidence from the Ukraine proves
that riding was practiced as early as 4 3 0 0 B .c .4 Thus, we can dismiss
thewhole idea that the Aryan invasion, which supposedly depended
on the use of horses, could only have occurred about the middle of
the second millennium B .c ., which is the date of the earliest available
depictions of horse-drawn chariots in the Middle East. The whole
idea of nomads coming down the passes of Afghanistan in war chari
ots is anyway fanciful. Chariots are not the vehicles of nomads but of
an urban elite, as is clear from their usage in ancient Greece, Rome,
and Mesopotamia. They are hardly appropriate for travel through
difficult terrain such as mountain passes.
Seventh Argument: In addition to the cultural continuity between
ancient and modern India, there is also a striking racial continuity.

bets reinforces the argument about the cultural continuity between
the Harappan civilization and later post-Vedic Hinduism in general.
F o u r t e e n t h A r g u m e n t : The Vedic Aryans have been credited with
the use of iron, and it has always been maintained that their use of
iron weapons and horse-drawn chariots guaranteed their supremacy
over the Indus people. However, the Sanskrit word ayas, thought to
denote “iron," appears to have stood for “copper" or “bronze." Earli
est evidence for iron in India dates back to before 1500 B.c. in asso
ciation with Kashmir and the newly excavated city of Dwaraka and
is considered to be an indigenous development. Vedic a y a s is associ
ated with a culture of cattle and barley, such as we encounter in pre
Harappan sites.
F i f t e e n t h A r g u m e n t : Contrary to popular scholarly opinion, the ge
nealogies found in the Puranas, which list over a hundred and twenty
kings in one Vedic dynasty alone, do fit into the new model of an
cient Indian histoty. The Puranic records are for more trustworthy
than has hitherto been assumed. They are the distillate of countless
generations of remembered knowledge, especially knowledge con
cerning the vicissitudes of royal houses. They date back to the third
millennium b.c. and earlier. Greek accounts point to the existence of
Indian royal lists (perhaps coinciding with those of the P uranas)
that are reported to go back to the seventh millennium B.c.
S i x t e e n t h A r g u m e n t : TheR ig- Veda, the sacred fountainhead o f later
Hinduism, shows an advanced level of cultural and philosophical
sophistication, suggesting a long antecedent development. The Vedic
language itself is highly sophisticated, and the Vedic pantheon is as
complex as that of later India. In other words, the Rig- Veda is by no
means the product of a primitive culture but of a people enjoying the
fruits of a mature civilization based on age-old traditions-a civili
zation that could not have been delivered to India on horseback.
Whatever the original homeland of the Aryans may have been, they
seem to have lived in India long before the alleged invasion occurred,
apparently for several millennia.

Seventeenth Argum ent: The Painted Gray Ware (PGW) culture in
the western region of the Ganges has frequently been referred to in
support of the Aryan invasion theory. However, carbon-14tests have
yielded dates of 1ittle more than 1100 B .c ., which is too late for the
modified date given for the Aryan invasion, though Max Müller's
proposed date of 1200 B .c . would roughly fit if it were not out of sync
with the Harappan evidence. At any rate, recent research has re
vealed connections between the PGW culture, the Northern Black
Polished Ware culture, the Black and Red Ware culture, and the Indus
Sarasvati civilization. Moreover, as archaeologist James Shaffer has
pointed out, all these labels based on pottery styles are ill-defined
and rather confusing and therefore best abandoned. 5
When we integrate the above arguments and other additional
evidence not specifically cited here, we obtain a picture of ancient
India that diverges considerably from the inherited Atyan invasion
model. It is a picture that is at once more credible and exciting than
the infelicitous hypothesis of an Aryan invasion. It removes the heavy,
near-impenetrable curtain of ideology that has prevented us from
seeing ancient India more clearly and faithfully, and it opens up to
our modern vision at least some of the splendor of that early era of
human civilization. From this new perspective we are now able to
turn our histor ical imagination upon specific aspects of ancient In
dian history and culture.

PART TWO
The Splendor o fA ncient India:
Its Cultural and Spiritual L egacy

U nderstanding the E a st
SINCE TH E TIM E OF C LASSIC AL GREECE, IF N O T EAR LIER ,
India has been lauded by outsiders as a land of
mystery, mysticism, and metaphysics. Many of the
mystical movements that have sprung up in the West
during the past two centuries, including Romanti
cism, Occultism, Thulism, Magic (notably that of Aleister Crowley),
Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, and Anthroposophy, have looked to In
dia for much of their secret knowledge, though without always un
derstanding it correctly. Thousands of contemporary Westerners have
visited India to savor its mystique or study its spiritual teachings,
and many gurus regularly visit the West to teach, or have even taken
up permanent residence in Europe and America.
India discovered its missionary spirit in the figure of Swami
Vivekananda, who held thousands spellbound with his talks during
and after the Parliament of Religions in 1883. It was primarily he
who, building on the cultural foundations of Romanticism, intro
duced the idea of the materialistic W est versus the spiritual East—a
distinction that may have served a certain purpose at one time but
that is breaking down today as part of the growing globalization.
There is as much practical materialism in the non-Western world
as there is in Europe and America. However, as an ideology, materi
alism has been for more influential in the West than it has been in



the East. On the other hand, the East did produce spiritual traditions
o f enormous profundity, diversity, and sophistication, as well as great
spiritual teachers. Yet, that Western
ers are not inherently materialistic
was demonstrated by Vivekananda
himself, who attracted and inspired
thousands of American men and
women.
While we do not need to uncriti
cally succumb to India’s mystique, as
did perhaps the German Romantics,
we nevertheless must learn to appre
ciate that the spiritual geniuses of
ancient India have in fact created a
pristine wisdom tradition that in its
depth and breadth is without parallel
in the world. Now as scholars begin
to understand the Vedtts' a little bet
ter, we cannot fail to recognize the au
F ig. 3 5 . s w ^ i W v e k a n a n d a
( 1863-1902) . thenticity and power of their spiritual
--------------------------------------- communication. What is more, India
continues to gift the world with great
teachers, though the finest flowers of its spiritual creativity are not
always those who achieve the greatest popularity or notoriety in
Western countries.
In reconstructing the history and culture of ancient India, we
must not fail to keep the moral and spiritual contribution of the Indie
branch of the human family clearly before our eyes. The same
Eurocentric bias that led to the formulation o f the erroneous Aryan
invasion model also is responsible for other distortions, notably the
view that we can learn nothing from India or other non-Western coun
tries. Fortunately, this arrogant notion— once widespread through
out the Western hemisphere—is gradually being replaced by a fairer
and more sensible attitude. Joseph Needham, the renowned author
of a multivolume histoty of Chinese science and civilization, made
the following pertinent comments:

was predicated on the incorrect Aryan invasion model and a rela
tively late date for the R i g - V e d a ( 1500 B .c. to 1200 B .c .) . We now
know that the Rig-Vedic hymns were composed in the third millen
nium B.c. and earlier. Therefore, there was an adequate length of
time for the development of concepts and practices from the Rig
Vedic sacrificial culture to the esotericism of the U p a n is h a d s . Be
sides, research has shown that there is a pronounced continuity of
ideas between the Vedic era and subsequent periods.
While the Sanskrit vocabulary has obviously changed and grown
in the long span of more than four thousand years, many key terms
have retained their original core meaning. The failure to realize this
is largely due to the bias among Western Vedicists, who see in the
V e d a s primitive poetry or expressions of an unsophisticated natural
ist religiosity. The same bias has been responsible for interpreting
ancient Egyptian texts as primitive, which bespeaks of an inability to
appreciate spiritual and occult symbologies.
For example, a principal Vedic theme is the conflict between light
and darkness and the need to cross over the darkness to reach the
light— a metaphor for attaining illumination or enlightenment. Un
der the primitivist bias, not a few Vedic scholars have interpreted
this symbolic notion in a naturalistic manner as a primitive fear of
darkness, or even in gross political and racial terms as a war be
tween the light-skinned Aryans and the dark-skinned natives. To
avoid such distortions, we must endeavor to approach the V e d a s
with the same symbolic sophistication that patently characterizes
the Vedic hymns. That is to say, we must look past our modern
prejudices and penetrate below the surface, realizing that the Vedic
language exceeds evetyday language and is profoundly spiritual.
As James Newton Powell, representing the new scholarly approach,
observed:

of all things, and, beyond elevated cognition, even realizes
himself or herself to be one and the same as the ultimate
Reality.
2. A universalist ap p roach : The ultimate Truth lies beyond
all possible conceptions of it. For the same reason, the Truth
can be approached from many different paths and with the
guidance of a variety of teachers and scriptures.
3. K arm a an d rebirth: In maturing and evolving toward Self
realization, the person undergoes many repeated births and
deaths. This process is governed by the law of karma, ac
cording to which every thought and action has a correspond
ing reaction, which shapes a person's immediate or future
destiny.
4. Spiritual p ractice: In order to attain Selfhood, or to realize
the nameless Reality, the person must be aware of the law of
karma. producing only such thoughts and actions that are
conducive to a spiritually auspicious life. Ultimately, the con
ditional realms in which the law of karma holds sway must
all be transcended. This is possible only by adopting a rigor
ous spiritual discipline. There are a number of practical paths
or approaches to Self-realization, which are widely referred
to as Yoga.
5. Spiritual initiation an d g u id an ce: Spiritual growth is seen
as depending on proper spiritual guidance from living teach
ers rather than on books or figures from the past. Spiritual
discipleship commences with a more or less formal initiation
in which the teacher makes a deeper connection with the
d iscip le -a connection that involves the direct transmission
o f psychospiritual energy and consciousness.
6. R itu al w orship: Rituals are special forms of action that are
intended to create higher states of consciousness through

THE SPIRITUAL HERITAGE OF ANCIENT INDIA i 177
the ceremonial use of images, statues, or other symbolic rep
resentations of deities and other elevated spiritual beings,
including teachers.
7. M editation: The introversion of the mind is an important
aspect of the spiritual path. Meditation helps to focus, clear,
and strengthen the mind, so that it becomes more capable of
reflecting the ultimate Reality (Self or Divine).
8. M antra recitation. One important way of stabilizing and
harmonizing the mind is through the recitation o f power
charged sounds called m an tras, either silently or aloud.
9. B reath control: Mind and breathing are intimately con
nected. Mind control can be directly brought about by means
of a variety of breathing techniques.
10. Posture-. Our inner state is affected by our bodily posture.
Hence in order to harmonize the mind, special physical pos
tures are employed as aids to concentration and meditation.
In the next section, we review the spiritual heritage o f the Vedas
in more detail, following the preceding framework of concepts and
practices.
The Depth o f Vedic Spirituality
1. Self-realization or G od-realization: The earliest clear articulation
of the notion of Self-realization, or the realization of the Absolute
(brahm an), can be found in the oldest U panishads, such as the
B tihadaran yaka, the Chandogya, and the Taittiriya. These expound
original insights about the identity of the person’s essential being
(or Self) with the essential nature of the universe at large. They also
recommend various moral practices and meditation exercises for re
alizing that ultimate Essence. In doing so, these U panishads base
themselves on the spiritual experiences and revelations o f the Vedic



seer-sages (n'shi). For example, we find the following passage in the
three-thousand-year-old B rihadaran yaka-U pan ishad (1.4. 10):
In th e beginning a ll this w as Brahm an. It kn ew its e lfonly a s
"lam Brahm an. ” Thus it becam e everything. He who am ong
th e Gods aw aken ed to this likew ise becam e That. Sim ilarly
with seers an d with [o th er] hum an beings. This the [V edic]
seer Vam adeva saw when he stated, “I w as M anu an d am
the Sun. "
In this cryptic passage, the anonymous composer of the Upani
s h a d quotes from a chant of the Vedic sage Vamadeva, who is the
main seer of the fourth book of the R ig- Veda. In the first verse of the
twenty-sixth hymn in that book, Vamadeva exclaims in ecstasy his
essential identification with everything:
I w as Manu an d now I am the Sun! I am the seer an d poet
sa g e K akshivat! I am [th e sa g e] Kutsa A rjuneya! I am th e poet-sage U shana! B ehold me!
In the Vedas, Manu represents the original Man, the progenitor
of the human race in our present world cycle. The Sun, Surya, is not
merely the visible luminary but the divine Light, the solar Self
again a potent Vedic notion. Vamadeva ecstatically identifies with
various illustrious sages who, before him, had realized the indivis
ible essential Being, the Brahman, or Absolute. The Upanishadic
idea of Self-realization thus has a clear Vedic basis. In the A itareya
U panishad (IV.5), another early work of this genre, Vamadeva is
similarly quoted as an example o f Self-realization. His autobiographi
cal statement, which reminds one of certain Egyptian hieroglyphic
texts, is as follows:
W hile I w as in th e womb I search ed out an d discovered the
births e fa l l th e Gods. A hundred m etal cities oppressed me. Then I.flew out with th e sp eed e f a haw k.
The womb of which Vamadeva speaks is Nature herself, cosmic
existence, which held him in confinement. Then when he had found
the birthplace of the d eities-th e ultimate Reality as the source of
178 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE SPIRITUAL HERITAGE OF ANCIENT INDIA £ 179
Gods and humans— he was able to extricate himself from Nature's
hold.
A number o f seers from the R ig-V eda are mentioned in the
U panishads as great sages and the originators of various esoteric
teachings. These include Manu, Brihaspati, Ayasya, Ghora, Dadhyanc,
and Vamadeva. Moreover, a number of Vedic deities also make their
appearance in the Upanishadic texts, not for their role in rituals but
as symbols of the Self, of prana (the life-force), or other spiritual
realities. Among them we find Indra, Agni, Surya, Vayu, and Aditi.
One of the most famous doctrines o f the B rihadaran yaka-U pa
n ishad (11.5) is the “honey doctrine" (m adhu -vidya), according to
which all aspects o f the universe are part of the same ultimate Be
ing— a singular Being that is inherently blissful. The B rihadaran yaka
explicitly relates this teaching to the honey doctrine of the R ig- Veda,
as taught by the seer Dadhyanc, son of Atharvan.
2. U niversalist approach -. Self-realization or God-realization presup
poses the existence of an ultimate Reality that transcends all finite,
temporal forms. This Reality has been given many names. In later
Hinduism the various deities like Shiva (“Benign"), Vishnu (“Per
vader"), and Devi (“Goddess") are freely identified with each other,
and any one of them can represent the ultimate Reality, the Absolute
or supreme Self. Chants to one deity may include or change over into
chants to other deities. This is because each deity is not a separate
divine being but merely a different form or conceptual doorway by
which the singular Reality can be approached.
This attitude, which characterizes Hinduism, reflects a sense of
universality, which permits the coexistence o f multiple expressions
for that singular Being beyond all manifest forms. The same attitude
is pervasive in the Rig- Veda, where the Gods and Goddesses repre
sent different aspects of the supracosmic Intelligence, each o f which
encompasses all the others as part of an integral reality.
For instance, the Rig- Veda explicitly identifies Agni, or the sacred
fire, with all the main male and female Vedic deities and with all the
powers of nature and aspects of the sacred teaching. But then Agni is
praised as the most excellent representation of the ultimate Reality:



O Agni, by y o u r vigoryou a re one with the Gods and, p er
fe c tly born, y ou su rpass them . (Rig- Veda II.1.15)
Further hymns identify Indra, Soma, Surya, and several other
Vedic divinities with all the other Gods respectively.
P oet-sages, g r e a t is th at beautjful N am e by which, O Vishve
D evas, y o u ex ist in Indra. (Rig- Veda IH.54. 17)
The Vishve-Devas (“All-Gods") mentioned in the above hymn strik
ingly represent the Vedic principle of universality and the perfect in
terchangeability of the members of the Vedic pantheon. They arecom
bined and integrated in different manners. These Vedic deities in
clude Heaven, Earth, plants, mountains, rivers, oceans, stars, hu
man beings, and animals, as well as different psychological factors,
such as intelligence and wisdom.
N ot o n e ofy ou , Gods, is like a child o r a youth. All i f y o u are
truly great.
M ay the All-G ods here, who are V aishvanara [th e universal
Fire], g ra n t us an d our cow s and h orses com plete rest. (Rig
Veda VIII.30.1 and 4)
In the second quote, the cows and horses are symbolic o f the sensory
and motor organs, which should be put to rest, or made peaceful, so
that higher spiritual vision can blossom. For the Vedic seers all of
nature was mirrored within the psyche.
This liberal Vedic orientation, which respects all Gods and God
desses, must not be confused with polytheism. Rather it is a cre
ative and universalist approach to the Divine that, in contrast to
many religious teachings, is free of dogmatic narrowness. Noticing
the Vedic custom of identifying the various deities with one an
other and then singling out one particular deity for praise, Max
Müller coined the word “henotheism " to distinguish this theologi
cal orientation from both polytheism and monotheism. However,
he wrongly believed that henotheism is a historical stage subse
quent to polytheistic syncretism, which identifies the various Gods
and Goddesses with each other. In other words, he underestimated
180 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



the Vedic sages' philosophical and theological sophistication. By
whatever name they invoked the great Being, they understood its
absolute uniqueness.
The w ise sp ea k q f th e sam e One a s Indra, Mitra, Varuna,
and Agni, an d H e h a s beautjful wings a n d g reat speed. There
is one lh lth but th e wise call it by differen t nam es su ch a s
Yama andM atarishvan [a n d so Jo rth ]. (Rig- Veda 1.164.46)
It is this Vedic idea of the unitary truth, underlying the many
paths, that serves as the metaphysical basis for the noted tolerance
of later Hinduism. It can also be said to be the glue that holds to
gether the enormous variety of spiritual teachings that compose the
tapestry of the Indic civilization. But it must be appreciated that this
orientation derives its strength not merely from philosophical insight
but actual spiritual experience, or higher wisdom. The Vedic seers
spoke with the authority of direct realization, as do the great teach
ers of modern Hindu spirituality.16
3. K a m a an d rebirth: The term k a m a or k a m a n , meaning literally
“action," is common in Vedic texts and specifically refers to the Vedic
sacrificial ritual. The Vedic ritual is a symbolic reenactment o f the
process o f cosmic creation, designed to reconnect the sacrificer with
the greater cosmic being. The term k a m a also refers to the process
of cause and effect on the moral level. It stands for the influence that
our thoughts and actions have on ourselves, propelling us into re
peated births and deaths. Karma is the force o f destiny, which, in a
way, can be viewed as the sacrificial ritual in which the cosmos itself
engages, ensuring justice in the complex process of change to which
all finite beings and things are subject.
When we study the early U panishads, which first talk about the
process of rebirth in a more or less open fashion, we find that the
discussion is in terms of the Vedic ritual, which consists of various
offerings into the sacred fire. There is even a direct quote from the
Rig- Veda (X .88.16) in support of the karma doctrine. It is said that
there are two life paths or “vehicles” (yana)— that of the Gods (deva
y a n a ) and that of the fathers or ancestors (p itri-y an a). The former
THE SPIRITUAL HERITAGE OF ANCIENT INDIA 1} 181



leads to enlightenment and freedom from rebirth, while the latter
leads to rebirth.
Those who are wise enter the flame of the sacred fire and thereby
merge into the day, the waxing half of the moon, the bright half of
the year, the worlds of the Gods (the powers of the light), the lumi
nous world o f the Sun, the worlds o f lightning (the realms of direct
illumination), and the worlds of Brahman (the dimension of infinite
and eternal light).
Those who do good deeds but nevertheless lack true wisdom are
reborn. They enter the dark phases of nature—the night, the waning
Moon, the dark half of the year, the world of the fathers (or ances
tors), and the Moon itself (the Vedic symbol for the mind or principle
of thought, which is reflective, as is the Moon's borrowed luminos
ity). After enjoying their accumulated virtues in subtle realms, they
return for rebirth by descending through space, air, water, and earth
to reenter a terrestrial womb. As karma and rebirth are explained
through the metaphor o f the sacred fire, the implication is that the
sacred fire ritual reflects the process of rebirth, which is the secret
knowledge behind the ritual. The sages voluntarily undergo a spiri
tual rebirth in order to escape the mechanism of karma and natural
rebirth altogether and to attain perfect identification with the tran
scendental One, or divine Being.
4. Spiritual P ractice: Self-realization or God-realization depends on
a process o f inner awakening that is known as spiritual practice. In
post-Vedic times, this practice has largely been equated with Yoga.
Hinduism distinguishes seven principal yogic paths, which are
thought to match the different temperaments of people:
( 1) Jn an a-Y oga— the Yoga of Knowledge, emphasizing spiri
tual discernment and renunciation of all that has been rec
ognized as being merely finite and temporal.
(2) K arm a-Y oga— the Yoga of Service, cultivating the
person's capacity for selfless dedication to labor for the good
of others.
182 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE SPIRITUAL HERITAGE OF ANCIENT INDIA 183
I
(3) B hakti- Yoga- t h e Yoga of Devotion, utilizing the person's
ability to cultivate love and surrender.
(4) R aja- Yoga—the Royal Yoga. focusing on mental control
through meditation and ecstatic mergence.
(5) Laya-Yoga—the Yoga o f Absorption, consisting of tech
niques, particularly visualization, that impact directly on the
psychoenergetic system of the human body-mind, thereby
revealing higher truths.
(6) H atha-Y oga— the Forceful Yoga, employing the physical
body's potential in order to strengthen and harmonize it, so
that it can serve as a fit vehicle for meditation and ecstasy.
(7) M antra- Yoga—the Yoga of Numinous Sounds, consisting
of the silent or audible recitation of mantras, or sacred words.
Jnana-Yoga is the fundamental orientation espoused in the Upa
nishads. Karma-Yoga typifies the ideal life of the householder. who,
because he or she has a family, is not able to renounce worldly life
and pursue meditation in the seclusion of forests or mountains.
Bhakti-Yoga is the method recommended above all other approaches
in the B hagavad-G ita, which was composed probably in the middle
of the first millennium B.c. Bhakti-Yoga always has a theistic flavor,
since the Divine is worshipped in a particular form, such as Krishna
in the Bhagavata tradition or Devi in the Tantric tradition. Raja-Yoga
is a relatively late term, which is particularly applied to the medita
tion system expounded by Patanjali in his Yoga-Sutra, which was
compiled between 2 0 0 B.c. and 2 0 0 a .d. Laya-Yoga is the Yoga most
typical of Tantrism, which flourished around 1000 a .d. Hatha-Yoga,
which is an offshoot of the body-oriented teachings within Tantrism,
is a latecomer in the long history ofYoga. It is concerned with purify
ing the body in order to spiritualize it. Mantra-Yoga, which is tradi
tionally deemed the easiest path, also acquired prominence through
the growing popularity of Tantrism. However, the basic elements of
all these yogic approaches, but especially Mantra-Yoga, can be found
in varying degrees of elaboration in the Vedas.



Thus the four main Vedic deities can be identified with various
Yoga paths. Agni, God of the sacred fire, relates to the Yoga o f Knowl
edge. Soma, God of the immortal nectar, relates to the Yoga of Devo
tion. Indra, who symbolizes prana or the life force, relates to all Yogas
directly concerned with utilizing the psychospiritual energy, espe
cially by means of the technique of breath control (pran ayam a).
Surya, the solar deity, represents the integral path of Self-realization
through enhanced awareness and self-discipline.
Ritual played a significant role in Vedic times. Even though the
Vedas were used as liturgical texts, they stress the superlative im
portance of spiritual knowledge or wisdom. This is in fact the very
meaning of the word veda. A range of other terms for knowledge,
understanding, wisdom, and intelligence is present in the Vedic
hymns, which points to the gnostic import of the Vedas. Tending the
sacred fire symbolizes the inner cultivation of the fires of awareness,
mindfulness, and w ak efu ln ess-th e way of meditation. The various
Vedic deities are constantly referred to as having special knowledge
and as being approachable through knowledge. Knowledge, or wis
dom, is the province o f the sages, who served the Vedic aspirant as a
living example:
Being ignorant, I ask the sag es w ho know n ot a s one who
know s but [s o th at I m ay obtain ] know ledge. W hat is the
One who in th efo n n o f th e Unborn h as establish ed th e six
reregions [ i f t h e w orld]? (Rig- Veda 1.164.6)
I d o n ot know w hat I truly am. I roam about, m ysteriously
fe tte r e d by my mind. (l.164.37a)
In th e suprem e sp a ce in w hich a ll th e Gods reside is th e [u l
tim ate] syllable (akshara) i f the chan t-if-praise. What can
one who d oes n ot know th is do with th e ch an t-if-p raise?
Those who know it, they s it together [in han n on y] in this
[w orld ]. (Rig- Veda 1.164.39)
The devotional element, or bhakti, also is prominent in the Vedas.
Most Vedic hymns are devotional chants to the Divine in its various
forms. In the Vedas, as in the scriptures o f later Hinduism, the Di
184 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



vine is worshipped as
father, mother, son,
daughter, wife, lover,
master, and so on. At
the same tim e, the
Vedic people w or
shipped the Divine in
animal forms and all
the myriad other forms
of Nature. God Indra,
for example, is related
to the bull, Suurya to a
steed, and Ushas (the
Goddess of Dawn) to a
mare. The Vedas are
filled with images of
worship involving the
m ountains, rivers,
dawn, wind, earth, and
sky. This view is epito
mized in the Vedic revelation of Purusha-Narayana, the cosmic Man
or primordial Person, whose body is the entire universe.
The principal means of Bhakti-Yoga is surrender, the opening of
the heart to the indwelling deity. This process of surrender is ritual
ized in the practice of n am askara, the gesture of placing the flat palms
of the hands together in front of the heart. Like the Christian gesture
of folding the hands in prayer, namaskara indicates a recognition
that the Divine is also present in the person so greeted.
Surrender (namas) is truly pow erful. In surrender I ta k e ref uge. Surrender upholds H eaven an d Earth. Surrender to the
Gods. Surrender is th eir niler. By m eans efsu rren der, I take
rrfugerfuom w hatever w rong action s [ I m qy have com m it
ted]. (Rig-V eda VI.51.8)
We say more about this aspect of Vedic spirituality under the
heading “Ritual worship" below.
THE SPIRITUAL HERITAGE OF ANCIENT INDIA ^ 185

As for Karma-Yoga, the whole Vedic sacrificial spirituality can
be viewed as embodying this approach of selfless service. For all the
rituals are performed for the larger good. The Gods and Goddesses
are worshipped and the ancestors are reverenced in order to main
tain the cosmic balance, which ensures everyone's welfare. Even
those sacrificial rites that have a more personal objective can be
understood to dovetail with and promote this larger purpose, be
cause they depend for their success on the cultivation of universal
virtues.
The elements of the other yogic approaches are discussed sepa
rately below, under “Meditation," “Mantra recitation," “Breath con
trol," and “Posture."
5 . Spiritual initiation an d gwdadance: Spiritual life has traditionally
been an initiatory path, depending on the transmission of wisdom
from teacher to disciple. Hence the teacher who possesses not only
scriptural knowledge but living experience is an individual demand
ing great respect, even reverence.
According to the Vedic tradition, even the Gods had their teacher
(guru) in the form of Brihaspati, a form of Agni and a master of
meditative prayer (brahm an). The M aitrayani-Sam hita (1.11.5) calls
Brihaspati the chief priest (purohita) o f the deities. He also is a fre
quent interceder on behalf of human beings, granting peace o f mind
to pious sacrificers. In general, the Vedic literature portrays him as a
benign, healing influence in the world.
The Vedas mention many illustrious sages and seers, the rishis,
who gained immortality in the company of the Gods and to whom
appropriate reverential offerings are to be made. It is they who, as
one Rig-Vedic hymn (X .14.15) puts it, anciently created the spiritual
path. Some Vedic sages achieved such fame that they have been re
membered ever since, figuring in many later Hindu scriptures. Among
these great gurus are Vasishtha, Vishvamitra, Agastya, Bharadvaja,
and Vamadeva. Not a few contemporary Hindu teachers trace their
lineage or family back to one or the other Vedic sage.
186 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
6. R itual w orship: The Vedic tradition and subsequent Hinduism are

essentially ritualistic. Rituals are not merely o f ceremonial value but
are designed to enact various spiritual truths and cosmic processes
on the human level. They are understood as effective vehicles of trans
formation for the participants, putting them in touch with the hidden
reality, the realm of the Gods and Goddesses, or the cosmic order.
Vedic rituals help purify the psychic environment both individually
and collectively and thereby qualitatively change consciousness so as
to make it receptive to higher truths. As the Vedic authorities insist,
the rituals are not to be done mechanically but with full attention and
proper control of body, mind, speech, and breath. In other words,
they constitute a form of yogic practice. In later times, the compound
kriya-yoga (Yoga of ritual action) is applied to this approach.
7. Meditation-. Various meditation practices are related in the early
Vedic texts. The Sanskrit word dhyan a, the most common term for
“meditation" and its numerous cognates are frequently employed in
the Vedas. D hyana stems from the verbal root dhi, meaning “to re
flect, conceive. meditate." As a noun, d h i denotes “visionary insight,"
“higher understanding," or “illumined intel
ligence." As a verb it appears. for instance,
in thegayatn -m an tra. the most famous and
most sacred o f all Vedic chants, in the Rig
Veda (III.62.10) as given on p. 129.
Illumination is the crowning achievement
of a long process of voluntary self-transfor
mation. This process is often couched in
„ Fig. 38. Thesacred syl
terms o f self-purification or catharsis. This /abie om, t hesource e f
idea, which is common to all schools of Hindu all other m ^ ras.
metaphysics, is already clearly expressed in
the Vedas. In one hymn of the Rig-V eda (IU.26.8), three filters are
mentioned by which the mind is purified, so that the hidden trea
sures of Heaven and Earth can be beheld. The idea of filters stems
from the soma ritual in which the sacred soma plant is actually pressed
and filtered to produce the ambrosia of immortality. There is thus an
exact correspondence between the external ritual and the inner spiri
tual process.



On the inner level, self-purification is accomplished primarily by
means of meditation and mantra recitation. The illumined, tranquil
mind is like a highly polished mirror that faithfully reflects the true
nature of the universe. Before the sage’s inner eye the heavenly do
main opens up, yielding its secrets and eternal bliss.
Meditation and recitation were essential to the Vedic sacrificial
rituals, as was flawless concentration. Only a perfectly focused mind
permitted the extreme punctiliousness with which the sacrifices had
to be performed in all their countless details, lest the deities or an
cestors should be offended through inadvertent errors of speech or
action. We may see in this extraordinary mental focusing the bed
rock of the later yogic technique of concentration (d haran a), which
precedes and underlies the meditative state.
As the British Vedicist Jeanine Miller has shown, the Vedic rishis
had a sophisticated culture of meditative introspection, which revolved
around the practice of what is called brahm an. 17Here brahm an stands
for the act and potency o f prayerful meditation. As Miller explains:

Miller further characterizes the Vedic brahm an as invocation and
188 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



evocation, “an active participation, by means o f mental energy and
spiritual insight, in the divine process." 19 As the Vedic seers pray:
“Invigorate our meditations, invigorate our visionary insights" (R ig
Veda VIII.35.16). They speak of “yoking" (y unjate) the mind and
the visionary insights. This is indeed the essence o f Vedic Yoga. Miller
goes on to explain Vedic meditation in three aspects, which she la
bels “mantric meditation," “visual meditation," and “absorption into
the heart" respectively. These are not separate types of exercise but
overlapping features of Vedic meditation practice.
The ultimate purpose of Vedic meditation is, as one hymn of the
Rig-Veda (VI.17.3) puts it, to “manifest the Sun.” The sun has since
ancient times been a symbol of higher consciousness, or enlighten
ment, the Self (the atm an o f Vedanta). In the Vedas, to realize this
inner sun is to becom e the Light of lights, the Godhead beyond all
deities, the supreme Reality. Once the sun is understood as the es
sential Self, all the secrets o f the Vedic Yoga begin to unfold, not as
some primitive Shamanism but as Vedantic philosophy couched in
mantric symbols. 20
8. M antra recitation. The word m antra stems from the verbal root
m an, meaning “to think, ponder." The suffix tra indicates instru
mentality. Thus mantra is that which cultivates deep thought, which
develops the mind. Mantras are sacred utterances of numinous power
and wisdom, which are repeated in various ways to direct the mental
energies toward higher realities and especially to the singular (eka)
Being at the apex or the heart of creation.
The entire collection of hymns known as the Vedas is mantric in
nature. Hence it is not surprising that many o f the most important
mantras of later Hinduism—but also of Buddhism and Jainism
should be found in the Rig- Veda itself. For example, Buddhist and
Hindu Tantric texts begin many chants with the sacred syllable om
and end them with sv a h a, which is the prime Vedic mantra used
when placing offerings into the sacred fire. The syllable om is not
mentioned in the Rig- Veda, possibly because it was deemed too sa
cred to be spoken out loud. Interestingly enough, also no graphic
representation of om has so far been found in the excavated Indus
THE SPIRITUAL HERITAGE OF ANCIENT INDIA ^ 189



towns. Even in some o f the early post-Vedic scriptures, this sacred
mantra is referred to only indirectly as the pran ava (humming sound)
or udgitha (upward song). In one Rig-Vedic hymn (1.164.39), cited
on page 184, we may have an oblique reference to the sacred syllable
om. At any rate, om is first named or written out in such Vedic scrip
tures as the Shukla-YYqjur-Veda (1.1).
Mantra-Yoga is an integral part of the Vedic approach to spiritual
realization.
T h efa th ersfo u n d th e hidden Light. With m antras e f truth
they g en erated th e daw n [ e ft r u e know ledge]. (Rig-Veda
Vll.76.4)
The fathers here are the spiritual fathers— the great seers and sages
of the human race— not merely family ancestors. Elsewhere in the
R ig-V eda (1.67.2). it is stated that the Divine can be discovered in
the “hidden place" by chanting the m antras that the sages have fash
ioned in the heart. The “hidden place" is the innermost chamber of
the heart, or the heart's spiritual counterpart. As in later times, the
notion of the heart as the seat o f the Divine plays an important role in the Vedas.
In the R ig-V eda (1.164.45), as in later scriptures, four levels of
sacred utterance, or mantra, are recognized. Only the outermost level
is accessible to the ordinary mind, while the others are opened only
by mystical apprehension. The sacred word is often personified as
the Goddess Sarasvati. In the A tharva-V eda (XIX.71). she is called
the “Mother of the Vedas,” who grants life, vitality, creativity, and
the splendor of spiritual wisdom.
Another important notion o f Vedic Mantra-Yoga is captured in
the term nam a, meaning “name" and referring to the various names
given to the Divine by the Vedic sages.
The seers m editated th e on'ginal n am e e ft h e Cow. They d is

{Rig-V eda IV. 1.16)
The Cow symbolizes the Divine Mother or cosmic feminine energy
that nourishes and supports all creation, what later came to be called
190 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



prakriti or sh akti. To this day, Hindus treat cows with great rever
ence, though many are not aware of the archaic Vedic origins of this
custom.
This divine word or name is identified with the sacred syllable
om, which is said to be the quintessence of the Vedas. Thus Classical
Yoga, as expounded by Patanjali in the Yoga-Sutra, knows om as the
symbol of the Lord, who is the primordial teacher o f Yoga.
9. Breath control. Several Vedic deities are intimately associated with
the wind, air, breath, or life force, variously referred to as pran a,
vata, and vayu. This is clearly so in the case of Indra, the foremost of
the Vedic Gods, who is coupled with God Vayu in several chants. In
one Rig-Vedic hymn (VII.9 1 .4 ), the worshipping sages invoke Indra
Vayu, inviting him to join their sacred assembly and drink with them
the mind-expanding soma draft. In fact, Indra-Vayu gets the first
and best part of the ambrosial juice.
From a yogic perspective, the soma liquid represents the pure
residue of the sage's experience when the doors o f perception are
cleansed. Indra-Vayu symbolizes the purified life-force that wells up
within the sage's tranquil mind, giving him or her spiritual vigor and
physical stamina.
In other hymns, God Vayu is invoked as the bestower o f life. As
Sri Aurobindo explained:
Vayu is the Lord e f Life. By th e an cien t M ystics life w as
considered to b e a g reatJorce pervading all m aterial exist ence an d the condition e f all its activities. It is this id ea th at
w asJon n u lated later on in the conception i f th e Prana, th e
universal breath e f life. 21
Aurobindo went on to explain that whereas Vayu was venerated
as the master of life energy, Indra was the master o f life itself, who
ruled over the mind. The coupling o f their names shows that the
seers understood the close connection between mental activity and
psychosomatic energy and its most visible expression, the breath.
They could be said to stand for inner and outer action respectively,
both of which are necessary for spiritual work to succeed.
THE SPIRITUAL HERITAGE OF ANCIENT INDIA ^ 191



The Vedic ritual proceeds by means of mind (meditation), speech
(mantra recitation), and breath (p ran ay am a). The practice of con
trolled inhalation, exhalation, and breath retention in ritual con
texts is well-established by the time of the earliest Brahm anas, nearly
four thousand years ago. For instance, the Jaim in iya-B rahm an a
(III.3.1) instructs the priests not to breathe during the recitation of
the gayatrim an tra. The B audhayana-D harm a-Sutra (IV.1.24) states
that magical heat (tapas) can be generated by holding the breath.
The K aushitaki-B rahm an a (II.5) speaks of breath control as the in
ternal fire sacrifice (agn i-hotra).
In the A tharva-V eda (XV.15-18), which ■antedates the B rahm a
nas, the various categories of the pran a, or “wind/breath/life force,"
are mentioned. This classification was undoubtedly not merely theo
retical but had practical applications, as do similar schemas in the
later Yoga tradition, especially the Hatha-Yoga branch.
10. Posture-. As Mircea Eliade, one of the great twentieth-century
historians of religion, has shown, Yoga is based on the principle of
reversal: The y og in seeks to do the exact opposite of the ordinary
worldling.22 Thus he endeavors to stop his mind, hold his breath,
abstain from food, shun social contact, arrest his semen (through
chastity) and, not least, remain motionless in the body—all in order
to inhibit the flux o f time itself by lifting his consciousness into the
infinite, immortal dimension of the Divine. In the case of Bhakti
Yoga and Karma-Yoga, this principle of reversal can be seen in the
cultivation of selfless love and service, neither of which characterize
the behavior of the ordinary individual, who tends to be driven by
egotism and the profit motive. The Tantric scriptures even have a
name for this principle of reversal: p ratiku la, meaning literally
“counter-bank," that is, going against the stream.
A sana, which means “seat" or “posture," is the most outward
aspect o f the yogic work o f reversing the ordinary flow of life. It
should therefore not surprise us to find evidence for the existence of
this limb of the yogic path in Vedic times. Many o f the soapstone
seals o f the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, which, as we have argued
in this book is essentially Vedic, show figures seated in various sac

erdotal postures, including the famous Pashupati seal, depicting Shiva,
Lord of the Beast.
The Vedas themselves do not mention specific Yoga postures, or
asan as, but neither does Patanjali in his Yoga-Sutra, which was com
posed several thousand years later. In one aphorism (11.46), Patanjali
merely specifies that posture should be steady and comfortable. This
does not mean that such postures were not known, but that they would
have been part of a more specific, oral, instruction. The proliferation of
yogic postures as known today was the product of the inventiveness of
the masters of Hatha-Yoga, which enjoyed increasing popularity after
1000 A.D., though it was probably based upon older traditions.
Vedic Spirituality and the Hindu Tradition
Hinduism is a stupendously complex phenomenon. It could be
said that there are more religions within Hinduism than outside of
it. Hinduism has never discarded or
excluded anything, giving each teach
ing its particular niche within an ever
expanding framework of ideas, be
liefs, and practices. In this way, Hin
duism has been able to assim ilate
alien ideas and practices without for
going its own fundamental teachings.
The more it has changed, the more it
has remained the same.
One way in which change has oc
curred within India’s religious culture
is in the gradual eclipse of particular
deities and the emergence into promi
nence of other Gods and Goddesses.
Thus the great Vedic deities Indra,
Agni, Soma, and Surya were super
seded by the great Hindu deities Shiva, Vishnu, Devi, and the el
ephantine Ganesha. It has been suggested that this change was the
result of a resurgence of pre-Vedic non-Aryan traditions. But this is

not borne out by the archaeological record. Otherwise one would
expect these later deities to somehow be associated with the Sarasvati
region and its mythology, which is not the case. Rather, Gods like
Shiva and Vishnu could be said to reflect the heritage of the Ganges
Yamuna era of Puranic times, while the classic Vedic deities reflect
the Indus-Sarasvati phase.
For example, God Shiva, who is often regarded as the main pre
Vedic or indigenous Indic deity, is in Hindu mythology the deity as
sociated with the Ganges River, which descends on his head. Shiva's
sacred city is Benares (Kashi), which lies on the banks of the Ganges,
not the Indus or Sarasvati. By contrast, the principal Vedic God Indra,
who in many respects resembles Shiva, distinctly relates to the
Sarasvati River. The connection of the later deities of Hinduism with
the Ganges River shows their later origin, at the time when the Vedic
culture shifted its center to the east after the Sarasvati went dry.
The rise to prominence of such deities as Shiva and Vishnu has
traditionally been understood as a development within the Vedic tra
dition itself, and not as the assimilation of non-Atyan deities. Given
the long history of India's civilization, these changes can be expected.
No outside influence need be invoked to account for the appearance
of these popular Hindu deities and the religious practices associated
with them. They are crystallizations o f theological-mystical imagery
present already in the R ig- Veda (which incidentally has five hymns
dedicated to Vishnu).
This does not mean, of course, that there was no outside influ
ence at all upon the Vedic tradition, but whatever foreign elements
were absorbed by the culture of early India, they did not change the
core features of the Vedic heritage. This recognition brings immedi
ate order and simplicity to the mass of historical facts. We no longer
have to postulate a mysterious pre-Vedic tradition that was some
how lost or obscured, only to resurface here and there in subsequent
times. In addition, we do not need to interpret the Vedic tradition as
being substantially at variance from later Hinduism, the two being
separated by a strange and inexplicable rupture. Rather, we can look
upon India's spiritual heritage as a consistent cultural system, which
happens to be the oldest surviving civilization in the world.

OUR WORD “SCIENCE" STEMS FROM THE LATIN SCIENTIA,
which is itself derived from scire meaning “to know"
and “to discern." Science is thus the pursuit ofknowl
edge. In our outward-looking civilization this has
come to mean primarily the search for knowledge o f
how the external world works and how we can learn to manipulate it
better. This understanding of science is rather limited, and it fails to
take into account knowledge that is accessible through introspection
and higher states of awareness as cultivated in the spiritual tradi
tions. When we glance into the past, we find that the creators of
ancient cosmologies relied greatly on these other forms o f knowl
edge. Today we often tend to dismiss their knowledge systems, or
worldviews, as mere myth. In doing so, we fail to acknowledge that
in our push for objective knowledge we too utilize intellectual modes
that are not always strictly rational, as has been shown by philoso
phers like Michael Polanyi and Paul Feyerabend.' In the preface to
his four-volume history of science, John Desmond Bernal makes this
germane statement: “Science, in one aspect, is ordered technique; in
another, it is rationalized mythology. "2
When we consider the evolution of science, we can sketch a pro

knowledge systems and human societies. This counting skill, com

bined with the capacity for simple observation, revealed to archaic
humanity certain fundamental regularities in Nature, notably the
seasons as well as solar and lunar cycles. The more intelligent ob
servers o f the past then formulated in their heads a predictive model,
which we now call a calendar. According to Alexander Marshack,
the marks on a forty-thousand-year-old rib bone found at Ishango
near the headwaters of the Nile represent the earliest calendrical
notations.3 Microscopic analysis showed that the incisions on the
bone had been made at different times by different tools. Marshack
a gifted writer rather than a scientist-speculated that what were
previously thought to be mere decorative or hunting marks are in
fact markings recording a periodic event, specifically the Moon's
phases. In support of his hypothesis, Marshack pointed to recent
carving-stick calendars kept on the Nicobar islands in the Andaman
Sea, which belong to India. There is nothing intrinsically wrongwith
the assumption that Paleolithic humanity should have been able to
count or to observe the Moon’s periodicity. However, it challenges
current scientific notions about the level of cultural sophistication at
that time, and therefore Marshack’s proposition has remained con
troversial.
Whatever we may think about Marshack’s hypothesis and the
computing skills of Paleolithic humanity, there can be little doubt
that the emergence of agriculture in the Neolithic age was dependent
on knowledge of the calendar, which allowed the ancients to deter
mine the right time for planting and harvesting crops. We can envi
sion that this naturally led to a more detailed mathematical analysis
o f the movements o f the Sun, Moon, and planets. Moreover, trade
requires bookkeeping, and commerce was apparently as important
to our Neolithic ancestors as it is to us today. Hence it should not be
surprising that arithmetic was known in a complex civilization such
as that of ancient India, which had both a thriving agriculture and
far-fiung trade.
Of course, mathematics and science are more than mere count
ing. Mathematics involves the discovery o f abstract general rules,
such as the Pythagorean theorem, which captures the fact that the
square of the longest side of a right-angled triangle equals the sum



of the squares of the other two sides. Geometry and physics likewise
call for generalization beyond the empirical.
Science in this sense did not flower in all ancient civilizations,
but we do find it present in the Indus/Sarasvati civilization. Some
historians even have suggested that the birth of science was trig
gered by Vedic philosophy and ritual.4The Vedic worldview acknowl
edges that there is an intimate relationship beween the cosmic, the
terrestrial, and the spiritual, which is expressed in terms of equiva
lences. The idea of equivalence, which is fundamental to what has
been called initiatic science, is that the universe is an interconnected
system—a notion that has made a comeback through the findings
and interpretations of nuclear physics and modern cosmology.
A related idea is that the macrocosm is mirrored in the micro
cosm and that the study of the large can reveal secrets about the
small. Discontented with the limitations o f quantum physics, the
British avant-garde physicist David Bohm formulated his model of
the implicate (enfolded) order.5 According to this model, the world
we see is the manifestation of a deeper, hidden dimension o f reality
in which everything is contained and interlinked. Bohm gave this
deeper reality the name “holomovement" to indicate that it is an all
inclusive dynamic process. Thus an elementary particle is not e l
ementary or fundamental at all but merely a name given to a par
ticular aspect of the holomovement. Little wonder that his work is
widely thought to build a bridge between contemporary science and
traditional wisdom.
Ancient humanity appears to have been extremely sensitive to
correspondences or equivalences in Nature. The regularity o f celes
tial phenomena, of the tides, and not least of biological rhythms—all
must have provided a powerful rationale for this holistic cosmology.
What we might dismiss as pure coincidence, our forebears would
take as a sign of the beautiful interwovenness of all things. There
fore they noticed correspondences and also imbued them with spe
cial meaning. For instance, the Ayurvedic savants made the aston
ishing discovery that the number of bones in the human body equals
the number ofdays in the year. They arrived at this number by count
ing the 3 0 8 bones of a newborn, 32 teeth, and 20 nails. They took
THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL 197



198 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
this as a confirmation of their basic belief that the human being is a
mirror image of the cosmos. In the Rig-V eda (X .90). the cosmos is
likened to an enormous man (pu ru sha). Conversely, the human in
dividual is a representation o f that cosmic giant. In today's scientific
language, we would say that “the body enfolds not only the mind
but also in some sense the entire material universe. " Without this
understanding, we cannot hope to understand the Rig- Veda and the
esoteric traditions built upon its worldview.
Sacrificial Ritual and A stronom y
Vedic cosmology evolved in conjunction with a complex system
of sacrificial ritualism. Sacrifice was understood as a means o f pre
serving the cosmic order on the human level by utilizing equiva
lences existing between the individual person and the macrocosmic
reality. We may see in the Vedic sacrifice a form o f technology ex
ploiting the equivalences or correspondences in Nature. In the sac
rificial ritual, the Vedic priests remembered the original self-sacri
fice of the cosmic giant owing to which the cosmos came into exist
ence. Thus the sacrifice involved in bringing forth the explicate or
der of reality from the implicate order is essentially the same sacri
fice that must be performed by the human being wishing to trace
the way back from the explicate order to the implicate ord er-fro m
the phenomenal world to the realm of immortality, luminosity. and
sheer bliss.
Many early agricultural societies understood this in a literal
sense—as human sacrifice. But in Vedic times. a metaphoric inter
pretation was in place: The sacrificer had to endure the hardship of
the ritual in order to consciously connect with the hidden dimension,
the implicate order, of the Ultimate Reality, the nameless One, which
was yet named in various ways. The thread leading to that One was
to be found within oneself, though only through the agency o f the
properly executed external ritual. Only later on, at the time of the
U panishads, was the ritual fully interiorized, being performed as a
Yoga of inward concentration and contemplation. However, elements
o f this inner ritual can be met with already in the preceding period.



THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL
For the asceticism (tap a s) connected with the Vedic ritualism de
manded utmost mental focusing, will power, and self-transcendence.
The Vedic sage, as much as the later yogin, had to undergo the or
deal of inner transformation. But whereas the former availed himself
of the supportive framework of the sacrificial ritualism, the latter
relied largely, though by no means exclusively, on the codified path
of meditative introversion.
When we examine the various Vedic rituals, we are struck again
and again bythe pervasiveness ofthe cosmological principle ofequiva
lence. Thus, in one of the most important o f these sacrificial rituals
the agn i-cayan a or “heaping up the fire"—the sky and the earth
were represented by square and round altars respectively. The square
arrangement of the sky altar was derived from the four cardinal di
rections, while the roundness o fth e earth altar represented the globe.
During the ritual, the round altar was made symbolically equivalent
to the square altar, which posed the problem of squaring a circle.
This and other similar symbolic issues led to basic mathematical and
geometrical questions.
Incidentally, the sky and earth altars were correlated with the
male and female gender respectively. Sexual symbolism is pervasive
in the Vedic religion. Thus the adhvaryu priest was deemed male
while the n eshtri priest, who was typically associated with the God
desses, represented the female gender. The Vedic texts speak of the
“copulation" between the chants and the prose formulas, the former
being considered feminine and the latter masculine. There are nu
merous “couplings" (m ithu n i-karan a) of this type in the Vedas and
the subsequent ritual literature. It is in this Vedic custom that we
must look for the seeds of the metaphysics of medieval Tantrism,
which views the cosmos as the product of Shiva’s and Shakti’s di
vine embrace (m aithuna).7
The emphasis on knowledge in the Vedic worldview naturally
also caused the ancients to pursue astronomy. Indeed, there are nu
merous astronomical references in the Vedas, and the planets and
stars have a special importance in the Vedic rituals. The principal
deity of the Vedic ritualism was God Agni, who was understood as a
personification of time. More specifically, Agni represented the year,



200 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
and the twelve-day agni-cayana ritual commemorated the ideal year
of 3 6 0 days. This astronomical preoccupation is also reflected in the
architecture of the Indus cities, for the streets and monumental build
ings are aligned according to the cardinal directions. The human world
was made to conform to the divine world.
Until recently, when one of the present authors (Subhash Kak)
discovered the presence o f a code in the design of the Vedic altars, no
proof had been available that the ancient Indic civilization possessed
any scientific knowledge. In fact, most scholars have regarded the
Vedic civilization as pre-scientific—a term that is widely used to sug
gest the subordination of knowledge to myth and ritual. Yet, even
before the discovery of the Vedic astronomical code, this widespread
opinion was clearly contradicted by the facts. As the renowned Dutch
scholar Jan Gonda observed:
M any p laces fin th e Vedic literature] attest to w hat m ay b e
called, a p re-scien tjfic interest in, an d study qf, th e world

know ledge e f anatom y, em bryology, and m edical practice.
Nor did som e lingristicefacts—a s f a r a s they were utilizable
f o r ritual pu rposes—esca p e the authors' notice.8
The astronomical basis of the fire altars as well as the discovery
of an altar code in the organization of the material of the Rig-V eda
confirm the need for a new understanding of the origins of science
and astronomy. The genealogies o f the P uranas as well as astro
nomical references in the Vedic scriptures take us back to events in
the fourth millennium B.c. and earlier, as we have already noted. q
This considerably pushes back the date for the earliest beginnings of
science in the broader sense o f the term, as the systematic observa
tion and study of phenomena. The emergence o f rational science is



generally associated with the ancient Greeks, who are hailed as the
early masters of mathematics and especially geometry. The Vedic
evidence obliges us to reconsider this assessment.
The Rig- Veda is a fascinating and unique record of ancient sci
ence four thousand and more years ago. As we have discovered, the
number of syllables and the verses of the R ig- Veda are layed out
according to an astronomical plan. The R ig- Veda could be called a
verbal counterpart to the monumental structures of Stonehenge, which
served astronomical computations. However, this famous archaeo
logical site in England is thought to have been constructed in the
period from 1900 B.c. to 1600 b .c., long after the composition of the
Rig- Veda. Also, whereas Stonehenge is badly damaged, the Rig- Veda
is considered by all scholars to be in a state of near perfect preserva
tion. Finally, words are more eloquent than even the most imposing
stone monument. And the words preserved in the Rig-Vedic hymnody
are most thoughtful and poetically skillful utterances by seers whose
vision penetrated deeply into the nature of existence. They also hap
pen to be the oldest recorded words of which we have knowledge. In
its overall plan, the Rig- Veda is an altar fashioned from hymns rather
than bricks. Its internal organization contains important cosmologi
cal information, which gives us a unique glimpse into the Vedic way
of thinking. The following section, which may be somewhat difficult
to follow, shows just how sophisticated the Vedic intellectuals—the
sages and seers—were.
Fire A ltars and H eavenly M athem atics
The Vedic rituals were generally performed at an altar, built with
a specific number of bricks that had not only ritualistic but astro
nomical and calendrical equivalences. Thus the altar design was based
on numbers that reconciled the lunar and solar years. The solar year
is slightly longer than 365 days, whereas the lunar year fractionally
exceeds 35 4 days. Reckoning the seasons with either of these calen
dars creates considerable problems. Since the Vedic rites were sea
sonal and meant to mark the passage of time, a workable calendar
had to be formulated. The ideal year of 3 6 0 days was found most

suitable. Other ancient civilizations, notably the Maya, reached the
same conclusion.
The fire altars were meant to symbolize the universe at large.
and the important agni-cayana rite involved three types of altars,
which respectively represented the earth, the atmosphere (or mid
region), and the sky (or Heaven). The sky altar was constructed in
five layers of bricks.
The sky was taken to
stand for the universe
as a whole, including
the atmosphere and the
earth. The first layer
represented the earth,
the third the atm o
sphere, and the fifth
the sky. The second
layer symbolized the
joining of the earth and
the atmosphere, whereas the fourth
layer stood for the joining of the at
mosphere and the sky. This altar
was most often symbolically repre
sented in the shape of a falcon or a
tortoise, but could be constructed in
several other forms as well.
The altars were built in a se
quence corresponding to ninety-five
years, with the size being increased
every year by a certain amount. The
amount of the increase represented
the extra days needed to make the
lunar year equal to the solar year.
At the completion of this sequence, after the necessary number of
intercalary months had been added to the lunar years, the ancients
obtained an excellent synchronization of the lunar and solar years.
An intercalation cycle of ninety-five years hints at a knowledge

of the length of the tropical year being equal to 3 6 5 .2 4 6 7 5 days,
which would be a surprisingly accurate figure for that early time of
more than five thousand years ago. Such knowledge could only be
based on a centuries-long tradition of astute astronomical observa
tion. The number of days in the year were mapped into altars of
different designs, using bricks of various shapes but o f fixed size.
This raised problems
of mapping equal ar
eas of various shapes,
such as a circle into a
square. The necessary
intercalation was ex
pressed in the altar
design. Solutions to
these practical prob
lems required the de
velopment of math
ematics, algebra, and
geometry.
The fire altars
were surrounded by
360 enclosing stones; of these, 21 were around the earth altar, 78
around the atmosphere altar, and 261 around the sky altar. In other
words, the earth, the atmosphere, and the sky were given the sym
bolic value of 2 1. 78, and 261 respectively. Since the cosmos was
thought to include the atmosphere and the sky, the two principal
cosmological numbers were 21 and 339 (78 + 261).
When we turn to the Rig- Veda, we find from the total number of
syllables that this text was itself taken to represent a symbolic altar.
Thus the number of syllables in the R ig- Veda is supposed to add up
to the number of m uhurtas ( 1 day = 3 0 muhurtaS) in forty years,
which is 4 3 2 ,0 0 0 . The same number of syllables were alloted to the
Yqjur- Veda and the Sam a- Veda conjointly, thus yielding a total of
864,000 syllables for the three principal Vedas. In reality, however,
the syllable count for the Rig- Veda is somewhat less because certain
syllables are meant to be left unspoken.
Fig. 42. Bird variant Qfthe Vedicßre altar.



The verse count of the R ig-V eda (excluding the eleven supple
mental hymns) can be viewed as the number of “sky" days in forty
years (or 261 x 4 0 = 10,440). Again, the verse count o f all four
Vedas is 261 x 78 = 20,358. Even the actu al Rig-Vedic syllabic count
of 3 9 7 ,2 6 5 can be obtained from these astronomical numbers.

Table 3. Hymns and groups in the Rig- Vedic books.
Not counting the eleven supplemental hymns. the Rig-V eda con
sists of 1017 (or 3 x 339) hymns distributed over 10 books and
gathered into 2 1 6 groups. These groups are the natural divisions
based on authorship, subject, or meter. When we treat the Rig-Veda
as being akin to the five-layered altar described above, we obtain the
following picture:
As the diagram shows, we can represent the
R ig- Veda as a five-layered altar with two books
to each layer. For our proposed parallel between
the construction of the fire altars and the inter
nal organization of the Rig-V eda to hold, we
would expect the first two Rig-Vedic books to
correspond to the atmosphere intermediate be
tween the earth and the sky. This is indeed the
case. The number of hymns in the first two
books (43 + 191) is 234. When we multiply the
symbolic value of the atmosphere (78) by three,
corresponding to the tripartite cosmology of the Vedas, this yields a
total of 234, which is exactly the number of hymns in these two
books.
Further astronomical values are obtained when the number of
hymns of the various books are considered. For example, the first
four books contain 354 hymns, which corresponds to the length of
191 114

87 75
62 58

Table 4. Rig- Vedic altar e f books.

the lunar year (the period between twelve new m oons). Similarly,
the total number of hymns in the middle four books (four to seven)
is 324, which equals the n akshatra (constellation) year of 12 x 27
days. When this is multiplied by a close approximation o f pi, we
arrive at l 017, which corresponds to the number of hymns in the
entire Rig-Vedic collection (excluding eleven supplemental hym ns).
The decipherment of the Rig-Vedic code has shown that, remark
ably, the Vedic poet-mathematicians had discovered the astronomi
cal significance of the numbers 108 and 3 3 9 .10 The number 108,
which is one-half the number o f hymn groups, as listed in Table 3, is
roughly the average distance between the Sun and Earth in terms of
solar diameters. It is also the average distance between the Moon
and Earth in terms of lunar diameters. These values can be obtained
by simple measurements with the naked eye. For example, if a pole
of a certain height were to be separated from the observer by a dis
tance that is 10 8 times this height, its angular size would be exactly
equal to that of the Sun or the Moon.
The second number—3 3 9 — is simply the number of solar disks
it takes to measure the Sun's path across the sky during equinox:
pi x 108 = circa 339. That the Rig- Veda should reflect the Sun steps
during the equinox is very fitting in light o f the special role of the
Rig-Vedic hymns in the spring equinox celebrations. The above dis
covery also would seem to explain why 108 beads are used in Hindu
rosaries. A full round' on the rosary represents a symbolic journey
from the earth to the sky.
We must note here that the actual—rather than the ideal— Vedic
year was reckoned as consisting o f 3 6 6 days. This allowed for easy
calculation, because northern India has a unique six-season climate;
thus each season can conveniently be assigned sixty-one days. The
year of 3 6 6 days was divided into two equal parts of 183 days, one
part representing the deities (or light) and the other representing
their counterpart (darkness). This symbolization was also under
stood to stand for the northern and southern courses o f the Sun. It
appears that the ancients sought to reconcile the 3 3 9 steps of the
Sun with the symbolic value 183 (representing the deities) by postu
lating a value of 78 for the atmosphere, since 339 = 183 + 2 x 78.



That this proposed interpretation o f the numbers I0 8 and 3 3 9 is
not based on mere coincidence is borne out by additional evidence.
For instance, significant validation can be found in the number of
solar steps for the winter and summer solstices, which also can be
derived from the code. The solar steps would be 3 3 9 on the day o f the
equinox and would vary relative to the solstices when the days are
shorter or longer. The two numbers in question are 296 and 3 8 2 .'1
They yield a ratio of 1.29 between them, which can be regarded as
the ratio between the longest to the shortest day from which the lati
tude of the place of the composition of the hymns. or the code, can be
obtained. Significantly, this ratio corresponds to the latitude of the
lower Sarasvati valleys, which textual evidence confirms was the re
gion of the composition of the hymns! Later Indic astronomy used as
its prime meridian the city of Ujjain, which is of a similar latitude.
The Planets and the Gods
There can be no doubt that the Vedic Indians studied the move
ment of the Sun and the Moon very carefully. It seems unlikely, there
fore, that they would have failed to notice the movement o f the plan
ets as well. The Rig-V eda speaks of the thirty-four “lights," which
are the twenty-seven lunar constellations, the five planets, and the
Sun and the Moon.12 There is also mention of “seven suns," com
prising the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets. The A tharva-V eda
mentions the planets along with the lunar nodes (rahu ), which sug
gests that the Vedic priests were able to predict eclipses.
According to Hindu mythology, the twenty-seven constellations
(n akshatra) through which the Moon passes are the Moon God’s
wives. Rohini (in Taurus) is his favorite spouse. In the Tatitinya
S am hita (11.3.5), belonging to the Yigur-Veda, the Moon God is said
to have thirty-three wives, which undoubtedly are the twenty-seven
constellations, the Sun, and the five planets closest to the Sun. Vali
dating this idea, a hymn of the R ig- Veda (X .85) celebrates the mar
riage of the Moon God with the Sun Goddess. The Vedic people ob
served the Moon's transit through various constellations and the plan
ets involved. As the fastest moving heavenly body, the Moon was
206 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



considered to be activating or impregnating the constellations and
the planets with which it became conjoined. The Sun and the planets
were seen as having a similar activating role. In this regard, the Rig
Veda (l. 105.10) speaks of the five bulls who reside in Heaven, which
are none other than the planets. All this irrefutably indicates the
antiquity of astronomical observation in India.
Information about the planets can be in terms of sidereal or syn
odic periods or both. Sidereal periods are computed with reference to
stars, corresponding to the period in which a planet circles around
the Sun, whereas synodic periods relate to successive conjunctions.
Thus the synodic period of the Moon is the interval between succes
sive full moons. Naked-eye astronomy is sufficient to compute both
types of periodicity. The sidereal periods for Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn have traditionally been calculated as being 87,
2 2 5 , 687, 4,332, and 10,760 days respectively. These numbers are
quite accurate. The sidereal periods can be obtained by multiplying
smaller numbers as shown here.
THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL 207
87 = 87 x 1 (Mercury)
225 = 58 + 75 + 92 = 75 x 3 (Venus)
68 7 = 191 x 3 + 114 ==43 x 16 (Mars)
4,332 ==62 x 70 ==58 x 75 (Jupiter)
10,760 ==104 x 104 ==92 x 117 (Saturn)
Factors from each o f these equations appear as the number of
hymns per book (m andata) . The arrangement o f the Rig-Vedic books
also yields the synodic periods in days and tithis. A tithi was reck
oned as a 360th part of the lunar year. Since the lunar year is slightly
more than 354 days, a tithi is somewhat shorter than a day. The use
of the tithi, which cannot be observed but must be calculated, in
itself indicates sophisticated astronomical knowledge. In this con
nection we should note that the total number of deities given in the
Rig-Veda— namely 3 3 3 9 —strongly suggests the tithi measurement.
There are 371 tithis in a year of 3 6 5 plus days, and when we multi
ply this figure by 9 we arrive at 3339. The 3339 Vedic Gods and
Goddesses thus represent a ninefold division o f the year measured
by tithis.

208
By adding the hymn counts o f the ten books o f the Rig- Veda in
different combinations, we obtain numbers that are factors of the
sidereal periods and the five synodic periods reckoned in days as
well as in tithis. The probability of this happening by chance is about
one in a million. Hence whoever arranged the Rig- Veda encoded into
it not only obvious numbers like the lunar year but also hidden num
bers o f great astronomical significance. This is an achievement un
paralleled in that early era.
This Vedic accomplishment is surely as astonishing as the astro
geometrical code o f the Great Pyramid. As the Egyptian-born engi
neer Robert G. Bauval has shown in his intriguing book The Orion
M ystery, the northern shaft o f the King's Chamber of the Cheops
pyramid was aligned with Alpha Draconis in around 2 4 5 0 B.c.,
whereas the southern shaft was aimed at Zeta Orionis at that time. 13
In addition, the northern shaft o f the Queen's Chamber pointed at
the star Kochab in Ursa Minor.
Bauval firmly believes that the ancient Egyptians knew about
the curious astronomical phenomenon of the precession (caused by
Earth's slight tilt) and that the three pyramids of the Giza plateau
capture the secret of the precessional return in solid stone. Other
researchers, notably J. B. Sellers and Schwaller de Lubicz, have ex
pressed a similar view.14This represents a significant departure from
conventional scholarly wisdom, which credits the Greeks—in par
ticular Hipparchus of Alexandria of second century B.c.—with the
discovery of the precession of the equinoxes.
Vedic and Hindu A stronom y
The Vedic sacrifices required precise astronomical knowledge and
a calendar based upon it. Full- and new-moon sacrifices occurred
every month, and those for the Moon when half full were sometimes
marked as well. There also were annual sacrifices based upon the
solstices and the seasons. The months were determined astronomi
cally by the particular constellation (n akshatra) in which the full
moon occurred during the month. Thus astronomy was one of the
fundamental sciences of the Vedic Indus-Sarasvati civilization.



How did the science of astronomy arise in ancient India? The
encyclopedia-like Puranas credit the legendary figure o f Pururavas,
one of the earliest Vedic kings, with the division o f the one fire into
the three fires that are the basis of the Vedic ritual. He is said to have
learned this secret from the g an d h arv as, a group of angel-like be
ings. The Rig- Veda (X.95) contains a mythological conversation be
tween Pururavas and the water nymph Urvashi, from which we gather
that he had previously violated Urvashi, who was pregnant with his
son. Consumed with passion but failing to win Urvashi back by his
pleading, the king finally threatens, in a veiled way, to commit sui
cide. This might explain his curious name, which means “he who
roars m uch."15One can conclude from the Puranic references and the
genealogical seniority of Pururavas that the fire ritual was a part of
the Vedic religion from the earliest times.
We may further speculate that the planetary periods were deter
mined toward the end o f the Rig-Vedic age and incorporated into the
code. It is possible that as this astronomical knowledge became more
widespread, its encoding in the inner structure o f the R ig- Veda was
gradually forgotten.
The astronomical code of the Vedic altars and o f the R ig- Veda
refutes the prevalent supposition that observational astronomy be
gan in Babylon during the middle of the first millennium B.c. The
fact that the earliest Vedic ritual was astronomical is attested to by
textual references in the R ig- Veda itself.
It is generally accepted that the references to the Vedic deities
Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and the Nasatyas in the Hittite-Mitanni treaty
of the second millennium b.c. refer to the Indo-Aryans rather than
the Iranians. It appears that the Indic element existed in southwest
ern Asia by the beginning o f the second millennium. In light of the
geological and archaeological evidence, which shows a time o f troubles
for the Indic civilization along the Indus and Sarasvati Rivers around
1900 b .c ., we can now postulate an exodus of peoples from India. We
can further surmise that this westward migration was in all prob
ability accompanied by a corresponding flow of traditional knowl
edge from India to the Middle East. This exported knowledge would
have included the astronomy of the fire altars and the planetary pe

riod values o f the Rig- Veda. Yet, we must add, it is also possible that
Vedic groups were present in southwestern Asia at an earlier period,
forming offshoots or colonies of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization be
fore the great disaster struck.
We know for certain that there was a continuing interaction be
tween India and Babylon in subsequent centuries. This is clearly
mirrored in certain interesting parallels between their respective
astronomies. Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned that the ratio be
tween the longest and the shortest period of daylight changed from
1.29 to 1.5, which implies a shift in astronomical observation from
the Sarasvati valleys to northwestern India. The latter value can be
found in the V edanga-Jyotisha, a manual of Vedic astronomy, which
mentions the winter solstice at the beginning of the constellation
Dhanishtha (23° 20' Capricorn) and the summer solstice in the middle
ofAshlesha (23° 20' Cancer). This configuration corresponds to about
1400 B.c. Interestingly, we find the same ratio of 1.5 in the Babylonian
texts o f the first millennium B.c., even though the earliest Babylonian
texts spoke of a ratio of 2.0, which more accurately reflects a region
much farther north.
The other significant parallel is that the Babylonian texts use a
linear zig-zag function to determine the length of daylight in inter
mediate months, which is already present in the Rig-Vedic model. It
is, moreover, weighty evidence that the Babylonians also used the
notion o f tithi, referring to it simply as “day," as was often done in
India as well. One might speculate that Vedic astronomy was taken
over by the Babylonians and was built upon further during the flow
ering that took place in Babylonia around 700 B.c.
Classical Hindu astronomy arose after the close interaction be
tween the Indians and the Greeks subsequent to the invasion oflndia
by Alexander the Great (323 B.c.). The existence of an indigenous
tradition of astronomical observation and theorizing, as shown by
the Rig-Vedic code, helps explain the puzzling fact that classical Hindu
astronomy diverges in many ways from the Greek astronomical legacy.
The existence of the Rig-Vedic code itself suggests that the math
ematical framework for the planetary motions was very old by the
time the influence of the Greek heritage made itself felt in India.



THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL
The development outlined here is consistent with what has been
proposed for the rise of Indian mathematics and geometry.16 Further
more, our present arguments confirm the prescient remarks by the
American scholar Ebenezer Burgess, who, over a century ago, noted
that the shared aspects of the astronomies of India, Babylonia, and
Greece appear to stem from India. 17
The discovery o f the Rig-Vedic code has opened important doors
of understanding for us. Since the code appears to be many layered,
and we have so far deciphered only the top layer, we may wonder
what further secrets about ancient observational astronomy still lie
hidden beneath it.
Qualitative Science: A strology
The Vedic insight that the cosmos is reflected in the terrestrial
and the human realms led, among other things, to the development
o f astrology. In fact, in ancient times, astrology and astronomy did
not form separate disciplines but simply were aspects o f the same
comprehensive cosmology. According to the astrological view, the
planets and stars are not merely physical bodies or quantities o f
matter whirling in space but qualities of both cosmological and psy
chological import. Their movement and patterned relationship to
one another are thought to have a significant parallel in the lives o f
individuals and nations. Various Vedic deities were assigned
rulership over the constellations, and their influence was thought
to be activated by the movement of the heavenly bodies through
the constellations, affecting both the psyche and destiny (karma)
of living beings.
Astrology is traditionally considered to be effective not because
of any actual physical influence of the planets or stars upon the hu
man individual or collectivity, but because of the preestablished har
mony between macrocosm and microcosm. In other words, astrology
is deemed an expression of the inherent generative mechanism of
Nature, which we can grasp, to some extent, through the theory of
correspondences or equivalences.



Ayurveda and Yoga
The notion of equivalence, which is fundamental to Indic as
tronomy and astrology, also underlies ancient India's medical sys
tem, or Ayurveda. The compound ayu r-veda means literally “life sci
ence." Ayurveda has often been called a naturopathic system of medi
cine. That it is much more is evident from the fact that the practitio
ners o f this medicine were also skilled surgeons, capable of plastic
surgery on the face and other parts of the body. Already at the time
of the R ig- Veda (1.1 16.15), surgeons seem to have been able to deal
with battle wounds and fit amputees with artificial metal limbs. “In
this respect," as A. L. Basham commented, “Indian surgery remained
ahead of European until the 18 th century, when the surgeons of the
East India Company were not ashamed to learn the art of rhinoplasty
from the Indians."18
The vast body of knowledge to which the term ayur-veda refers
is sometimes considered a fifth Veda. The earliest expression of
Ayurvedic knowledge can be found in the A tharva- Veda, one of the
four hymnodies forming the Vedic sacred canon. From there a long
but still obscure line of development led to the great medical com
pendiums of the post-Christian era, the C araka-Sam hita (150 a.d.)
and the Sushruta-Sam hita (350 a .d.). The latter work is attributed
to the physician and sage Sushruta, who appears to have lived in the
early sixth century b.c. and thus may have been a contemporary of
Gautama, the founder of Buddhism.
The doctors o f Ayurvedic medicine, which is still practiced today,
regarded a healthy or wholesome (hita) life as consisting in the proper
balance of body, mind, and emotions. In determining what is whole
some, the Ayurvedic authorities took into account not only the present
life but also future lives, or embodiments. They acknowledged the
need for self-preservation, happiness, and a benign postmortem ex
istence as basic to a wholesome life. Unless a person was severely
afflicted by karmas from wrongful thoughts and actions, he or she
was thought to be destined for a long life of a hundred years. Con
trary to other systems of thought, the Ayurvedic schools contended
that proper medical care could prolong an individual’s life even when
212 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL
adverse karmic conditions prevailed, providing the karma was not
produced by truly heinous transgressions of the moral order (such
as homicide). Thus the Ayurvedic physicians rejected the theory of
total determinism, allowing the human will (and ofcourse medicine)
a measure of freedom to interfere with the karmic process.
According to the Ayurvedic system, the mind is composed o f the
fundamental qualities or constituents of Nature—sattv a, ra ja s. and
tam as. Sattva is the principle o f lucidity and purity, rajas the prin
ciple of dynamism, and tamas the principle of inertia or darkness.
Mental instability is the result of an imbalance between these three
factors. When they are balanced, the sattva component is in a state
of great purity, which releases the inner intelligence or wisdom. The
main cause of illness is held to be the obstruction of this native intel
ligence (prrqjnna-aparadha).
Paralleling this triadic deep structure of the mind are the three
humors of the body— v ata, pitta, and kap h a. They are often ren
dered as “wind," “gall," and “phlegm" respectively, though these
translations are rather inadequate. In this theory o f the triple hu
mors (tri-d osh a), the three bodily components roughly correspond
to the elements of air, fire, and water. These, in turn, are associated
with the three principal Vedic deities Indra (for vata/wind), Agni (for
pitta/fire), and Soma (for kapha/water).
Incidentally, Plato proposed a similar theory in which health
was based on a correct relationship between the three elements of
pneum a (representing wind), ch oie (or “gall," representing fire),
and phlegm a (which is a manifestation o f the water element). As
the French Indologist Jean Filliozat noted, the tri-dosha theoty is of
Vedic origin:
A s these dosas, an d especially the association betw een the
g a ll and thef i r e a re already known in th e Vedic literature,

In symmetry with the five-layered Vedic altar, the ancient sages
considered the body to be composed of the five material elements,
generally listed as earth, water, fire, air, and ether. A Balinese illus
tration of the brain, drawn according to Ayurvedic ideas, shows a
traditional representation of the terrestrial equivalences of cosmo
logical or astronomical facts. Thus we find the cosmic mountain,
Mount Meru, in the middle of the brain, representing a symbolic axis
of brain functions that corresponds to the axis connecting Earth’s
center with the center of the universe at large. Mount Meru has been
equated, on the physical plane, with the pyramid-shaped Mount Kailas
in western Tibet.
Similarly, the Milky Way is a macrocosmic analogue of the ter
restrial Sarasvati and Ganges Rivers. Within the human body, it has
its parallel in the nerve pathways called n adis. These nadis, which
serves as conduits for the life force, are ofgreat importance in Yoga.
The yogins seek to control the flow of the vital energy in these con
duits, since this gives them control over the higher nerve centers of
the brain and thus over the mind.
Following the Vedic theory of macrocosmic/microcosmic equiva
lence, the scriptures of Hatha-Yoga speak of an inner or psychoso
matic sun and moon. The former is located at the level of the solar
plexus, while the latter is said to be situated in the head. Central to
the Hatha-Yogic process is the synchronization, or harmonization,
of these two internal luminaries. According to an esoteric explana
tion, the word h a th a (ordinarily meaning “force") is composed of
the syllable ha, standing for the solar force, and the syllable tha,
representing the lunar force in the human body. Yoga is the union of
these two fundamental principles.

This yogic notion of internal polarization has its modern coun
terpart in the medical concept of hemispheric specialization, which
was discovered in the 1930s, though it began to be more widely
researched only in the 1960s.20 According to this model of the brain,
certain mental activities tend to be associated with the left cerebral
hemisphere, while others are more specific to the right side of the
cortex. Writing two decades before this discovery, purely on the ba
sis of yogic experience and theory, Sri Aurobindo made this perti
nent observation:
The intellect is an organ com posed ifs e v e r a l groups o f Ju n c
tions, divisible into two im portant classes, theJunctions and
fa c u lties i f the right hand, theJunctions an dfacu lties i f the
left. T h efacu lties e f th e right han d are com prehensive, cre ative, and synthetic; th efacu lties i f th e left hand critical and
analytic. . . . The left lim its its e lf to ascertained truth, the
rightg rasp s that w hich is still elusive or unascertained. Both
a re essen tial to the com pleteness i f th e hum an reason.21
The medical understanding o f the natural polarization of the
human mind may well represent ancient scientific knowledge, ar
rived at through deep introspection and personal meditative experi
mentation. The same approach, for instance, underlies much of what
Patanjali states in his Yoga-Sutra about the nature of consciousness
and the possibility of supersensory knowledge. The yogins, India's
psychonauts, anticipated many of the insights of contemporaty psy
chology, and their practical knowledge of the higher reaches of the
human mind remains unmatched in the world of modern science. As
Mircea Eliade observed:
The psychological and parapsychological experience i f the
E a st in g en eral an d i f y o g a in particu lar is unchallengeably m ore extensive and m ore organized than the experience on
w hich the Western theories i f th e structure i f th e psyche

THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL
Knowledge from th e Vedic Perspective
What is the method of science? Briefly stated, the scientist iso
lates a phenomenon, observes cause-effect relationships, and then
describes the phenomenon in terms of its components. But before
scientific observation can begin, it is essential to assume that the
world is knowable and that it follows natural laws. The Vedic sages
made precisely this declaration.
The Vedic theory o f knowledge is based on a belief in the
interconnectedness and unity of the whole universe. As mentioned
before, according to the Vedas, the cosmos (ad h id ev a), the individual
living being (ad h ib h u ta), and the Spirit (adhyatm a) are intimately
connected. It was for this reason that the Vedas were meant to be
interpreted in three ways. Thus the Vedas speak of the seers in the
sky as stars, on Earth as sages, and in the head as cognitive centers.
Likewise, the Vedic texts know o f the Ganges o f the sky (the Milky
Way), the Ganges River on our planet, and the Ganges of neural
pathways of the brain. These mysteries o f the universe were com
municated to the people through the theater o f ritual. As we have
seen, cosmological knowledge was encoded in the design of the al
tars and in the Vedic ritual itself.
The Vedic rishis appear to have thought very deeply about the
limits of logic and science, and they were the first to recognize that
straight logic cannot answer all questions. They realized that scien
tific knowledge inevitably includes paradoxes, because reality is in
herently larger than the language or languages by which we endeavor
to describe it. Yajnavalkya, the famous seer of the B rihadaran yaka
U panishad (IV.2.2), expressed this insight very well, if poetically,
when he said: “The Gods are fond of the invisible (p aroksh a) and
dislike the visible." The invisible here is the vast realm of existence
that transcends the senses and the mind.
The seers of the R ig- Veda addressed the great mysteries o f e x
istence and tried to shed light on them without, however, dissecting
them intellectually to the point where they vanish and lose their psy
chological efficacy. Rather, the Vedic seers allowed their thoughts to
gently revolve around the mysterious, leaving it intact, while at the



IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION

same time communicating its essence. They were masters o f para
dox. Hence we must not read the Rig- Veda superficially. Otherwise
we will find ourselves in the same state of perplexity that befalls our
mind when, for instance, we take the quantum-mechanical principle
of complementarity literally: An electron is sometimes a wave and at
other times a particle. This principle makes sense only when we re
sort to a metaphoric interpretation.
The Vedic tradition has long understood the difficulty of captur
ing reality through the net of language. Hence it has always empha
sized intuitive insight and the search for deeper meaning behind lan
guage. Thus, the Vedic texts are not about anthropomorphic Gods
and Goddesses competing with each other, for each deity is every
other deity; in reality, they are merely metaphors for certain univer
sal principles or psychocosmic agencies.
The Vedas are to be read not with the closed mind of dogmatism
but with a questioning attitude. To ask questions is the first step in
the discovery of meaning. The Vedic system enjoins the use of ques
tioning and reasoning. which is a clear sign o f its scientific orienta
tion, in the broad sense explained above.
The B e g in n in g s o f a U nified S cie n ce in th e Vedas
The Vedic hymns repeatedly proclaim a unity that lies beyond all
categories of opposition, such as being and nonbeing, death and
immortality, knowledge and ignorance. This radical oneness is inex
plicable and, by implication, can only be “seen" in an elevated state
of mystical awareness. The differentiated aspects of this oneness are
our everyday distinct categories— from trees to people to the star
studded sky.
That ultimate singularity (eka) is conceived as a creative reser
voir or potentiality. Creation proceeds by means of the paradoxical
process of sacrifice. The Sanskrit wordyqjna, usually translated as
“sacrifice," has several connotations, including “creation through
transcendence," which is the meaning most appropriate to the philo
sophical hymns of the Vedas. The whole universe is conceived as a
sacrificial altar out of which the world's potentialities emerge into



THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL
actuality. According to the Vedic seers, the properly attuned mind
can comprehend the nature o f this creative process that extends from
the microcosm to the macrocosm.
In a famous hymn of the Rig-V eda (X .90), the ultimate creative
singularity is envisioned as a macranthropos or giant man, called
purusha. This primordial superbeing is described as having “a thou
sand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet." The purusha per
vades the world and transcends it by “ten fingers." Only one quarter
of the macranthropos can be found in the realm o f creation, while
three quarters are said to be immortal in the heavenly domain.
Through the purusha’s self-sacrifice the world was created. His
mind is said to have given rise to the Moon; his eyes to the Sun; his
breath to the air element; his navel to the midspace; his head to the
sky; his feet to the earth; and so on. Even the structure of ancient
India's society was thought to have been preordained by this self
sacrifice, since the purusha's mouth gave rise to the brahmin estate;
his arms to the warrior estate; his thighs to the people at large; and
his feet to the servile estate.23
The symbolic representation of the universe in the shape o f the
Cosmic Man found expression in a distinctive approach to architec
ture, sculpture, and literature. The purpose of all human creation
was not only to preserve the unity o f the macranthropos but also to
recapitulate the purusha's original creative sacrifice that produced
the cosmos itself. More than that, all human activity—whether sa
cred or secular (which is really a modern distinction)—was to be
modelled on the Cosmic Man. The very purpose of life was to know
the great mystery of existence, which is the mystery of the purusha.
Vedic Psychology
The Theory qfPure Awareness
The pivot of Vedic psychology is the notion of the transcendental
unitary Self, or atm an, which is pure awareness. Later Hindu tradi
tion speaks o f it as the witness (sakshin ). Mircea Eliade remarked
about this idea that it is “one of India’s greatest discoveries," which



must not be disregarded by Western thinkers.24 The Self, which is
also called purusha, is the ultimate core of the human being. It is
nonlocal and atemporal, constituting the singular and irreducible
Individuum underlying each human personality. It represents the di
mension of freedom and unalloyed bliss, transcending all mental and
physical phenomena, which are inherently limited. Thus the Self, or
Spirit, is the ultimate Singularity hidden behind all things. This no
tion stands in stark contrast to Western philosophical thought, which
treats awareness or consciousness as an attribute o f the mind which,
in turn, is considered a product of the brain’s neural activity.
If awareness is transcendental and singular, the question arises
of how the mental processes in diverse brains are possible. Here
Vedic tradition offers an ingenious answer. It explains our ordinary
consciousness— as opposed to the transcendental awareness—as a
cerebral phenomenon. In this it agrees with modern neurophysiol
ogy. However, the Vedic tradition makes the further claim that the
mental processes are continuously apperceived by the Self and that
the S e lfs presence in the background of the mind is sufficient to
give our mental processes the appearance of being independently
conscious.
Part of this illusion of the mind's independent consciousness is
the ego sense (“1," “me," “m ine"), which so powerfully dictates the
flow of ordinary life. The ego sense is also referred to as the empiri
cal self or psyche (j i v a ), as opposed to the transcendental Self. It is
this empirical self that is transcended in the moment of enlighten
ment, when one awakens to the all-inclusive identity of the atm an
and ceases to identify with a particular body-mind.
The relationship between the Self and the mind is typically com
pared to the relationship between a source of light and a mirror: Act
ing as a mirror, the human mind has no light of its own but merely
reflects the light (or awareness) of the self-luminous Self, just as it
reflects the objects presented to it via the senses. The philosophical
schools of Hinduism have paid considerable attention to the problem
of how the transcendental Self can possibly have any interaction at
all with the immanent body-mind. They invented a variety of pos
sible solutions to the problem. However, in the final analysis, all
220 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL
these theories contain paradoxes that leave the logical mind unsatis
fied and demand of us that we go beyond linear thought.
Nor are the explanations offered by the philosophers of the vari
ous schools intended to be ultimately satisfying answers. Their pur
pose is more modest, namely to guide the inquirer into an intuitive
appreciation of the reality behind the logical system. Logic and argu
ment have fulfilled their function when they have successfully pointed
the way to direct realization. In other words, all schools o f Hindu
philosophy purport to be paths to spiritual liberation.
In addition to the monumental paradox of the relationship be
tween Self and the finite body-mind, we also encounter various para
doxes when we try to describe physical reality, as the Vedic philoso
phers discovered long ago. They noted, for instance, that if matter is
divisible, each atom must be pointlike because otherwise it would be
further divisible. But how can pointlike atoms generate gross matter,
which is of a certain size? Some Vedic philosophers reasoned that
space is neither continuous nor discontinuous. If it were continuous,
its points could not be isolated and enumerated. On the other hand,
if it were discontinuous, we would have the problem o f how objects
could move across the discontinuity? A popular way of expressing
these difficulties was to talk about the riddle of being and becoming.
The basic question here is: How does an entity change its form and
become another? This kind of sophisticated speculation is attested to
already for the R ig- Veda.25
The VedicModel ef theMind
The postulation of an ultimate unity behind the multiplicity of
the universe made it natural for the ancient Indic sages to take up
the study of the mind. After all, the mind does not automatically
give us this knowledge of unity. If anything, it appears to contain a
mechanism that actively occludes the Self. The Vedic model of the
mind is best epitomized by the famous chariot metaphor found in
such Sanskrit works as the K atha-U pan ishad and the B h ag av ad
Gita. Here a person is compared to a chariot that is pulled in differ
ent directions by the horses yoked to it; the unruly horses represent



the sen ses in their
undisciplined state.
The driver holding the
reins is the mind, and
n ext to the driver/
mind stands the
charioteer, represent
ing the Self, which is
pure awareness and
perfect unity.
As these ancient
texts explain, the pur
pose of Yoga is to re
strain the senses/
horses and make
them compliant with
the driver's will. Modern parlance reflects something of this task in
the expression “Hold your horses!" The driver has to be disciplined
enough to receive and execute properly the directions o f the chari
oteer, the master of the chariot. In other words, the mind has, to
open itself to the Self's light. This, the ancient sages assure us, is
perfectly possible through the key yogic practices of meditation and
concentration.

The Five Sheaths
In an attempt to understand the relationship between the tran
scendental Self and the psychophysiological structures of the indi
vidual human being, the Vedic thinkers elaborated a model that makes
use of the principle of hierarchy. According to this model, which was
first fully expressed in the T aitânÿa-U panishad (II.2-5) some three
thousand years ago, the self-luminous Spirit, or atman, is encased
by five layers. These are known as the five sheaths (kosha), repre
senting progressively lower levels of vibratoty existence. In descend
ing order, they are:



THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL
Blissful sheath (an an d a-m ay a-kosh a)
Intellectual sheath (vijnana-m aya-kosha)
Mental sheath (m an o-m aya-kosha)
Energetic sheath (p ran a-m aya-kosha)
Physical sheath (an n a-m aya-kosha)
Beyond and obscured by these layers, and yet forming their very
essence, is the Self (atman or purusha).
The top three sheaths are often grouped together and collectively
called the mind. The mental sheath is concerned with the “lower"
mental functions, which process the input from the five senses to
form perceptions out of the raw data provided by sense organs. This
level of mental activity is commonly captured in the Sanskrit term
m anas (from the verbal root m an, meaning “to think"). The m an as
is the sensory-motor mind, which thrives on the material it gathers
from the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell.
The intellectual sheath is related to “higher" mental functions,
such as discernment and cognition in states o f mystical awareness.
These higher functions are often expressed in the term buddhi, which
can mean simply “cognition" but also “intellect" and “wisdom." The
buddhi further transforms the material already converted by the lower
mind from the sensory impressions. This is the organ o f philosophi
cal thought and metaphysical intuition. It is also the seat o f the hu
man will, by which we orient our life toward either unreflective bodily
experience or enhanced awareness and spiritual realization.
The blissful sheath is accessible only through ecstatic states or
in deep sleep, when bliss (an an da) is experienced. This sheath is
closest to the luminous Self, and acts like a final thin veil before the
truth. In many schools of Hinduism, the S elf is itself said to be
blissful, but this bliss is unconditional, exceeding both the body
and the mind.
According to Vedic teachings, inserted between the threefold
mental sheath and the material body is the energetic sheath. This is
a template of concentrated life force (prana), which, on the physical
level, corresponds to the nerve impulses. Prana, in its universal as
pect, underlies all physical a n d mental processes. But in this schema,

it stands specifically for the field of energy that penetrates and sur
rounds the physical body and has variously been styled “astral body, "
“etheric double," and “plasma body." It is the medium of exchange
in the whole psychophysiological system.
This Vedic model has exercised a great influence over much sub
sequent psychological thought in India. It is important to realize that
the various frameworks developed by the early and later Indic au
thorities all stand in the service o f practical spirituality. To reiterate,
they are not mere academic analyses but an integral part of the effort
by sages and mystic explorers to map out a practical path to Self
realization.
The Hierarchy efPsychophysiological Functions:
The Cakras
Since a person’s state of mind is mediated by the psychosomatic
energy, or prana, the ancients paid intense attention to the study of
the energetic template. They discovered that prana is not evenly dis
tributed in the pranic sheath enveloping the material body. Rather it
forms several vortices or funnels that seem to be actual connecting
points between the etheric field and the nervous system of the physi
cal body. These vortices are widely called cakras (also spelled chakras
in some English books), which literally means “wheels." Often they
are also referred to as padm as, or lotuses, because in appearance
they somewhat resemble the lotus flower.
The Hindu tradition recognizes seven such primaty focal points
of the prana, which correspond to major nerve plexuses in the physi
cal body and are analogous to the seven primary lights of the exter
nal universe. The R ig- Veda frequently speaks of seven worlds, seven
rivers, seven sages, seven wisdoms, seven pranas, and so on. While
the R ig - Veda does not specifically mention the cakras, it is quite pos
sible that the Vedic sages knew o f these seven pranic vortices. At
any rate, the model of seven energy wheels is thoroughly Vedic.
The lowest vortex, called “root-prop wheel" (m u ladhara-cakra),
is located at a place corresponding to the base of the spinal column.
The next prank center, enigmatically called the “self-standing wheel ”



THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE IN RITUAL
(sv ad h ish th an a-cakra). is a few inches above the reproductive or
gans. The third vortex, called “jewelled city wheel" (m an ipu ra-cakra).
is at the solar plexus. The “wheel of the unstruck sound" (an ah a ta
cakra) is in the heart region. The fifth vortex, known as the “purity
wheel" (vishu ddhi-cakra), is at the throat. Between the eyebrows
and possibly located at the brain core is the “command wheel" (qjn a
cakra). At the crown o f the head (fontanelle) is the “thousand-spoked
wheel" (sa h a srara -ca k ra ).
By stimulating these cakras through breath control, concentra
tion, and other techniques, the ancients endeavored to cultivate not
only paranormal abilities (extensions of our ordinary sensory func
tions) but also mystical states of consciousness. Above all, by acti
vating the topmost pranic vortex, the sages and yogins have always
aspired to piercing through all the layers or sheaths of the body
mind in order to realize the transcendental Self, or spiritual Singular
ity. According to an esoteric teaching transmitted in the U panishads,
it is also the center at the crown of the head through which the sage
seeks to consciously exit at the hour of death. On the cosmological
level of explanation, this represents an ascent to the top of Mount
Meru, or the pole star. Esoterically, the pole star is the pinhole in the
roof of our symbolic universe through which we can escape into the
implicate order of the invisible reality. The Vedic sages were as con
cerned about the way in which they exited the world as how they
conducted their life while living in it. They did not fear death, be
cause in their intuitions they had acquired knowledge o f the death
less realm of Being, but they respected it. For them, the emergency of
death meant emergence into the invisible domain.
Evolution from the Vedic Perspective
The idea of evolution is integral to the Vedic theory of knowl
edge, which regards all o f Nature as a manifestation o f the Self. Ac
cording to this evolutionary understanding, the higher animals are
endowed with greater cognitive abilities, and thus are capable of
mirroring more faithfully the more subtle or sublime dimensions of
the universe.



IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
226
The Vedic understanding of evolution is not at odds with the Dar
winian theory of evolution, though it has a different focus. The urge
to evolve into higher forms is taken to be inherent in nature. The
movement from inanimate to progressively higher forms of life is
clearly articulated in the system of Samkhya, which recognizes twenty
four principles of existence—from the material elements to the psy
chic or mental faculties to the transcendental matrix out of which all
dimensions and objects of Nature evolve. Samkhya emerged as a full
fledged philosophical system after the time of the Buddha. However,
many of its principal ideas can be found in the early Upanishadic
literature of three thousand and more years ago. Some scholars have
even suggested that certain hymns of the Rig-Veda (notably X.90
and X .129) contain the seeds of the later cosmological ideas.
At the mythological level, ancient India’s evolutionary ideas are
most strikingly expressed in the Puranic model of God Vishnu's vari
ous incarnations. These are thought to have progressed from the
form of a fish, tortoise, boar, man-lion, and dwarf to that of a human
being. The first human form in this evolutionary sequence was
Parashu Rama or “Rama with the Axe," whom some writers have
identified as an anonymous teacher of Paleolithic humanity. Next
came Rama, the hero of the R am ayan a epic, who was followed by
Krishna, the divine mentor of Prince Arjuna in the M ahabharata
epic, more particularly the B hagavad-G ita.
In modern times, the Bengali seer-philosopher Sri Aurobindo
made a conscious attempt to connect the spiritually oriented Vedic
evolutionism with the Darwinian evolutionary theory. He expressed
the ancient Vedic point of view well when he wrote:
We sp eak e ft h e evolution e fL ife in Matter, th e evolution e f

In sum, the Vedic thinkers evolved a system of analysis within a
consistent metaphoric framework, which was supported not only by
mystical vision but by skillful ratiocination. By postulating intercon
nections and similarities across Nature, they were able to use logic to
reach extremely subtle conclusions about diverse aspects of reality.
It appears that they were the first to create a science that went be
yond mere observation in order to obtain a comprehensive under
standing of the workings of the universe. This science was largely
based on a quantitative and qualitative model of astronomy, which
was applied both to the physical cosmos and the human mind.
A remarkable demonstration of the elegant and economic ap
proach of the Vedic scientific method, as formulated in ancient India,
is the influential Sanskrit grammar of Panini, which is one o f the
jewels of Indic thought. Panini, who probably lived in the fourth cen
tury B.c., succeeded in describing, in the tersest fashion imaginable,
the complex structure of the Sanskrit language in four thousand rules.
As A. L. Basham noted in his book The W onder That W as India:
Though itsJam e is m uch restricted by its specialized nature,
there is no doubt th at P an in i'sgram m ar is one q fth e g r e a t
est intellectual achievem ents (lfan y ancient civilization, an d
th e m ost detailed and sd en tjfic gram m ar com posed before
the 19th century in any p a rt q f th e w orld.27
Panini was able to draw on the expertise of a long line of gram
marians preceding him. While we do not know how far back gram
matical experts were pondering the Sanskrit language, a love for lan
guage and analysis is evident already in the Rig- Veda. Such careful
attention to language presupposes a high level of self-reflection and



228 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
critical intellectual ability, which also is implied by the Vedic think
ers' intensive preoccupation with astronomy, mathematics, and other
scientific disciplines. We can expect the same sophistication in the
area of spirituality, which is precisely what we are trying to convey
in this book.

ferred to the astronomical information contained in
the Vedas and, among other things, have mentioned
how the Vedic references to astronomical positions
can be used to determine the dates of the hymns. In
this chapter we will examine the astronomical basis ofVedic and Hindu
mythology so that we can better understand how such knowledge
was obtained and what its greater implications might be.
From our modern perspective that contrasts the sacred with the
secular, we can barely appreciate that the ancient world did not arti
ficially divorce spiritual wisdom from scientific knowledge, or myth
and ritual from astronomy and calendrics. The worldview of the bear
ers of the early Indic civilization formed an organic whole. It was a
comprehensive cosmology within which there were no watertight
compartments of knowledge but various areas of understanding with
permeable boundaries. These diverse areas were held together by
the fact that all knowledge had one and the same purpose, namely to
provide existential meaning and guidance so that the cosmic order
{rita), the divine mandate, could be fully respected through conso
nant action on the human level.
Today knowledge seldom has this life-enhancing function, and



perhaps because of the compartmentalization o f modern knowledge,
most people's self-understanding is quite defective. According to some
guesstimates, every year around one hundred billion new bits of in
formation are created. This massive growth in knowledge notwith
standing, science has so far proven lamentably incapable of guiding
us to wholeness. It emphasizes analysis at the expense of synthesis,
and in its radical skepticism and pronounced materialistic orienta
tion has undermined the knowledge system that forms the bedrock
of our religious heritage. Even though the religious worldview, as it
informed the minds and hearts of our forebears in the Middle Ages,
had great shortcomings, it did provide a compass that allowed people
to live with faith and to escape the canker of meaninglessness and
alienation. Nevertheless, new paradigms of science, such as those of
quantum mechanics and complexity theory, do attempt to address
the question of wholeness. They keep alive the debate within scien
tific circles about the relationship between fact and value, or empiri
cal data and meaning. It is not surprising that these more integral
paradigms are closest in spirit to the Vedic vision.
If we want to comprehend the Vedic hymns, we must suspend
our peculiar psychological malaise and epistemological narrowness.
We must adopt a “soft" approach, remaining open to the various
intersecting levels of discourse in them. For instance, on one level
the deities are spiritual beings with whom mystical communion is
possible and whose benign presence is invoked to shape a person's
life on Earth. On another level, the deities are forces associated with
Nature's spectacles, such as light, darkness, fire, wind, water, earth,
dawn, and not least fertility. On a third level, the Gods and God
desses o f the Vedic pantheon are related to psychological aspects of
the human being, such as brightness, somberness, anger, creativity,
or love. On a fourth level, the deities are in some contexts associated
with or representing the mighty forces of the celestial vault, such as
the two luminaries, the planets, and the stars and stellar configura
tions. Put differently, the Vedic deities are universal archetypes of
great flexibility. They were called upon to explain or render mean
ingful both internal and external phenomena, which were under
stood as being part o f the same all-embracing continuum.

Astronomy and mathematics were crucially important to the
ancients, as scholars are beginning to realize. Recent work on this
aspect o f antiquity— which has been given the label “archaeo
astronomy"— has brought about a veritable revolution in our under
standing of the religious symbolism and rituals of past civilizations.
Today we barely look up at the night sky and when we do, we scarcely
are able to identify the visible planets, stars, and constellations. Sur
prisingly few people are aware o f the fact that, like the Moon, the
stars too traverse the celestial vault. Fewer still know that at the two
equinoxes the rising Sun seems to hover for a while on the horizon,
or that the constellation o f the Ursa Minor (Little Bear) revolving
around the pole star in exactly twenty-four hours makes a perfect
nocturnal clock.
Astronomy was not born from idle curiosity. Rather the ancients
looked to the heavens for guidance. Knowledge of the luminaries,
including the stars, was vital to their existence. By the stars mer
chants navigated safely across the oceans and deserts, and farmers
planted their precious crops at the right time to guarantee a harvest
of plenty. Most importantly, the regularities in the sky provided the
key to sacred time and space. The behavior o f Sun, Moon, planets,
and stars was o f decisive importance for the ritual calendar.
The ancients believed that the celestial processes governed hu
man destiny. This sense of correlation between heaven and earth
was later epitomized in Hermes Trismegistus' famous esoteric axiom
“As above, so below." It was the task of the religious specialists to
study the heavenly patterns so that the rituals would faithfully re
flect the divine order. More than that, the celestial geometry served
the ancients as an archetype for their sacred buildings— altars,
temples, and sacred cities.
The British astronomer Gerald S. Hawkins has demonstrated that
Stonehenge is a giant three-dimensional stone computer, erected at
the beginning of the third millennium B.c., that permitted the precise
calculation of the solar solstices and equinoxes as well as extreme
positions of the moon.1

As scholars are beginning to appreciate, the ancient Maya were
keen stargazers who kept astoundingly accurate astronomical tables.
They also were extraordinarily skillful timekeepers, working with no
fewer than five calendars. Their preferred object of astronomical study
and religious veneration was Venus.
We could pile example upon example from around the world to
show both the high regard in which the star-studded sky was held in
remote antiquity and the considerable astronomical knowledge the
ancients accumulated over millennia. The situation was much the
same in ancient India. From the Vedic literature we know that the
entire sacrificial ritualism of the Indic/Vedic tradition is based on
cosmological and astronomical correlations.3 In this chapter, we will
be looking at Vedic mythology from an astronomical perspective. We
intend to show the intimate connection between Vedic myths, ritu
als, and astronomy.
VEDIC MYTHS AND THEIR ASTRONOMICAL B ASI S 0 233
Similar M yths, D ifferent Cultures
The decipherment of the scriptures of the lost civilizations of the
ancient world has revealed intriguing parallels between the mytholo
gies of the lndic, Greek, and Roman civilizations. What is more, the
ancients were aware of these parallels. Thus when Alexander made
his brief incursion into northern India in 326 B .c., the Greeks were
surprised to discover that the two most popular Indic deities were
similar to their own Herakles and Dionysos. It is now believed that
these parallel Gods were Krishna and Shiva respectively. Both Herakles
and Krishna were dark-skinned deities. Each killed a monster— Hy
dra was slain by Herakles and the demon Kaliya by Krishna. Both
enjoyed sexual relations with many maidens— nymphs in the one
case and cowherdesses (g o p i) in the other. Dionysos and Shiva were
conceived as powerful divine beings of great mystery and paradox,
who moved at the fringes of the celestial elite. Because o f their limi
nal position, they felt free to show humans the way to mystical union
with the deities and the ultimate Reality.
The ancient Greeks fancifully assumed that the wine-bibbing
Dionysos had visited and conquered India accompanied by his wild



entourage ofMaenads and Satyrs. According to Diodorus, Dionysos's
expedition to India took two years. after which he returned to Boeotia,
riding on an elephant to celebrate his alleged victory. However. the
direction of the flow of religious ideas appears to have been in the
opposite direction— from India to Greece and other Mediterranean
countries. As the French indologist Alain Daniélou observed:
We h av e no texts explaining the rites an d cerem onial e f the
D ionysiac m ysteries in th e G reco-Etrusco-Rom an world, a l
though there are allusions which can often b e clarj/ied with
the aid q f Indian te x ts . . . By studying Shivaite rites [from
India], th e only on es w hich have continued down to our
own times, th e real practices q fth e D ionysiac rites an d “m ys
teries " m ay b e reconstructed.A
As we might expect, there are important differences in the sto
ries about Krishna and Herakles on the one hand, and Shiva and
Dionysos on the other. Yet, the learned men accompanying Emperor
Alexander—and later the ambassador Megasthenes—recognized that
the similarities outweighed the differences, which were due to the
separate cultural contexts. They also recognized that behind the
multitude o f Gods and Goddesses, as symbols for various aspects of
Nature, lay the same belief in a single, fundamental Reality.
The ease with which deities with different names in geographi
cally separated cultures were accepted as being identical indicates
that the ancients knew that names in themselves did not define their
Gods and Goddesses, but rather that it was their attributes that were
significant.
We now know that myths in far-removed cultures can have many
shared themes. This may be due to a common cultural origin in the
distant past, or the commonality of human experience, or possibly
also the internal archetypal logic of mythmaking. But we must not
overlook a fourth possibility, which is that of cross-fertilization
through contact between cultures, especially by way of trade ■or mili
tary conquest.
As we have stated previously, the ancient world was culturally
far more interconnected than has been assumed. In particular. we

have made a strong case for ancient India's extensive maritime ex
perience. The Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl demonstrated the
technological feasibility of sea journeys in antiquity. Among other
things, he sailed a reed boat down the Tigris to the mouth o f the
Indus. From there he headed southwest toward the African coast,
though he could just as easily have gone on to sail to the tip o f the
Indian peninsula and beyond to the Maldive islands. For this is e x
actly what northern India's merchants did four thousand and more
years ago. In his book The M aldive M ystery, Heyerdahl reports on
his discovery o f Harappan artifacts on the islands south of the In
dian peninsula, which clearly demonstrate the seafaring enthusiasm
and skill of the Indus-Sarasvati sailors. 5
The ships from India carried not only cargo of much-sought
after spices, exquisite cotton, precious gold, and other rare metals,
as well as exotic timber and animals, but also people who held all
manners of ideas and beliefs and practiced all kinds of religious ritu
als. It seems reasonable to assume that these seafarers were as im
portant an influence on other cultures as the luxury goods they came
to deliver. Perhaps, in not a few cases, the ideas they brought across
the ocean with them had a more penetrating and long-lasting effect.
We can imagine, for example, that when the merchants and
learned travelers from India shared with their hosts in foreign coun
tries some of their astronomical knowledge they peppered their ac
counts with the telling o f relevant legends and myths.
Some of the earliest astronomical lore is found encoded in myths.
M yths and the Starry Sky
When we consider the astronomical element in myths, we dis
cover that Varuna (India), Ouranos (Greece), and Osiris (Egypt) are
identical in fundamental ways. All three deities were born to the Great
Mother Goddesses and typically represent the night sky. More spe
cifically, they symbolize the constellation of Orion, and their myths
refer to the vernal equinox in that constellation, corresponding to the
era of the seventh to the fifth millennium B.c., which is roughly the
age of Gemini. The ancients appear to have been aware o f the pre
VEDIC MYTHS AND THEIR ASTRONOMICAL BASI S 0 235



cession of the vernal equinox, and they sought to do justice to it by
translating Orion's mythology into the symbolic language of the era
of Taurus and later the era of Aries.
Thus, according to Egyptian mythology, Osiris was killed by his
hostile brother Seth (Ursa Major), and, in Indic mythology, Tvashtri
Dyauspita and Prajapati were killed by their youngest son, namely
Indra or Rudra (Sirius). Prajapati’s death at the hands of Rudra marks
the passage of the vernal equinox from Orion (or zodiacal Gemini) to
Taurus. The old A itareya-B rahm an a relates the latter story of how
Prajapati, the lord of the year, is punished for being in love with his
own daughter Rohini (the star Aldebaran in Taurus). by having his
head cut o ff by Rudra. This is a further explanation that the year had
shifted from Orion to Rohini— a transition that occurred after 4000
B.c. The story o f Dyaus and Indra refers to a still earlier age.
The idea of the equinoctial precession is also expressed in one of
the best known myths of India, which is the churning of the primor
dial milk ocean, as graphically described in the M ahabharata epic
(1.1 7 -1 9 ). In this myth, which seems to be hinted at in the Rig-Veda
(X .136.7) already, the churning symbolizes the precessional shift of
Earth's position in regard to the stars. Here is a brief paraphrase of
this popular myth.
At the end of a world age, the deities and the demons united to
churn the cosmic ocean in order to win the draft of immortality
(am rita) hidden in its depths. Using Mount Mandara, the cosmic
mountain, as the churning stick and the Serpent King Vasuki as a
rope, the two parties set the giant mountain in motion. From their
efforts, the foaming mass first yielded milk, next the Moon, and then
the Sun. These were followed by the magical kau stu bha gem and the
cosmic elephant Airavata.
As they churned on, the world ocean produced the kalaku ta poi
son, which promptly enveloped the entire universe. In order to pre
vent the world's total extinction, God Shiva came to the rescue, hold
ing the poison in his throat by the power o f a sacred chant. It discol
ored his throat permanently, whence he is called the blue-throated
God. At the request of the Creator-God Brahma, Shiva swallowed the
poison to eliminate its threat forever.

The churning continued, and at long last a white vessel contain
ing the precious nectar of immortality emerged. Instantly, the de
mons seized the vessel, but before they could drink its priceless fluid
and achieve immortality, God Narayana (Vishnu) intervened. As
suming the beautiful form of Mohini, enchantress of illusion, he ap
proached the host of demons. They were so bewitched by Mohini's
appearance that they willingly handed her the vessel. She immedi
ately gave the nectar to the deities, who drank it and thus secured
eternal life for themselves.
When we decode this myth from an astronomical viewpoint, we
find that the primordial milk ocean is none other than our Milky
Way. The deities represent the stars of the northern sky, whereas the
demons symbolize the stars of the southern celestial hemisphere.
The rope is the zodiacal serpent, which determines the Sun's course
through the constellations of the ecliptic. Mount Mandara (or Mount
Meru) is both the world axis and the Earth axis. The turning of this
axis determines not only the microcosmic day and year but also the
macrocosmic event of what is called the Zodiacal Year. The Zodiacal
Year has traditionally been fixed at 2 5 ,9 2 0 years, which is one full
cycle of the shifting of the Sun's equinoctial passage from one con
stellation to the next every Zodiacal Month, extending over 2 1 6 0
years. Shiva's swallowing of the poison establishes the stable order
that prevents the breakdown of the cosmic clockwork. He thus em
bodies the archaic Vedic notion of universal harmony (rita).
In their quest for harmony, the ancients looked for perfect order
in the heavenly vault. They deemed any irregularity, such as the
sudden appearance of comets, as inauspicious and threatening. The
phenomenon of the precession must have seemed to them a phe
nomenon lying midway between harmony and chaos, certainly hold
ing a great secret. They regarded the switch of the equinoctial point
from one constellation to the next as a major change, heralding sig
nificant consequences on the microcosmic level— that is, on the level
of human life on Earth. As above, so below.
Indeed, when we examine the symbolism of past cultures be
longing to different equinoctial eras, we find a corresponding fasci
nating shift of emphasis from the motif of the cosmic twins (in the
VEDIC MYTHS AND THEI R ASTRONOMICAL B ASI S 0 237



Gemini era) to the bull (in the Taurus era). to the ram (in the Aries
era). and then to the fish (in the Pisces era). In each era, the astrono
mers-astrologers-priests seem to have created new imagery for an
cient truths, pouring, so to speak, old wine into new wine skins.
The annual celestial circuit of the Sun is due to the motion of
Earth in its orbit around the Sun. From Earth it appears that the Sun
is moving in relation to the background of stars. This circuit is called
the ecliptic. The constellations of stars that fall along it are known as
the zodiac.

The Earth's axis of rotation is tipped at an angle o f 23.5 degrees
with respect to the direction of its orbital motion around the Sun.
This is w hat causes the changing seasons because the length of the
day keeps on varying. The longest and the shortest days, also called
summer and winter solstices, occur roughly near the 21st of June



and the 2 l st of December. The date of a solstice (literally “sun still")
can be marked by noting that on that day the Sun appears to linger at
the same extreme at noon. During the summer solstice the shadow
cast by a vertical stick at noon is the shortest, whereas at the winter
solstice it is the longest. This is one way in which these two dates
were fixed in ancient India.
The days on which daytime and nighttime are equal are called
equinoxes (literally “equal nights"). The two equinoxes, vernal in
spring and autumnal in fall, mark the halfway point between sum
mer and autumn. The equinoxes occur at the two intersections o f the
celestial equator and the ecliptic.
Long ago, the stars began to be used as a means o f calibrating
the calendar. Some groups of stars dominate the winter nights and
others the summer nights. Thus astronomers would look for the first
or last appearance of a striking group o f stars like the Pleiades. An
other calibration could be done with respect to a star’s heliacal
(presunrise) appearance. As mentioned before, the heliacal rising of
Sirius (Dog Star) was extremely important to the Egyptians, who
calibrated their calendar according to it.
Due to the precession, the elongated axis o f Earth does not al
ways point to the same fixed star. Polaris (alpha Ursae Minoris) is
the pole star now, but around 3 0 0 0 B.c. it was alpha Draconis, which
was later followed by beta Ursae Minoris; twelve thousand years
from now it will be Vega. The equinoxes and the solstices shift with
respect to the background stars.
More than a hundred years ago, the Hindu scholar Bal Gangadhar
Tilak argued in his controversial book The Orion that a great deal of
mythological narrative is a symbolic description of the changing ori
entation ofEarth against the background ofthe stars.6 More recently,
Georgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend have put forward the
same idea in their exceptional work H am let's M il.1
The precession of the polar axis leads to a precession of the equi
noxes and solstices. The equinoxes move along the ecliptic in a di
rection opposite to the annual course of the Sun, shifting from Can
cer (circa 8 0 0 0 -6 0 0 0 B.c.) to Gemini (circa 6 0 0 0 -4 0 0 0 B.c.) to Tau
rus (circa 4 0 0 0 -2 0 0 0 B.c.) to Aries (circa 2 0 0 0 -0 B.c.) to Pisces (circa
VEDIC MYTHS AND THEIR ASTRONOMICAL BASI S 0 239



0 -2 0 0 0 A.D.), rather than the reverse. The next equinoctial constella
tion will be Aquarius, the sign of the Water Bearer.
In Vedic times, Earth was pictured— that is, abstractly repre
sented—as a plane going through the celestial equator. In this view,
the equator divides the zodiac into two halves: the northern band of
the zodiac, reaching from the vernal to the autumnal equinox, repre
sents dry land; the southern band o f the zodiac represents the cos
mic waters below. The four corners of the world are the zodiacal
constellations rising heliacally at both the equinoxes and the sol
stices. The central frame of the cosmos is represented by the world
axis (called sk a m b h a ) , which pierces through all layers of the multi
story universe. As the A tharva- Veda (X. 7.35) states:
The skam bha su stains both heaven and earth here; the
skam bha sustains the mid-re&on betw een them ; th e skam bha
su stain s the six w ide directions; th e skam bha entered this
w hole world.
In ancient India, the stellar constellations were mapped out into
twenty-seven or twenty-eight lunar constellations or mansions (n ak
sh a tra ). While the Moon spends about a day in each of these man
sions, the Sun traverses each constellation in the course of about
l3'/3 days.
De Santillana and von Dechend have plausibly argued that the
Vedic God Agni, who is said to be born in the “highest sky" and who
had three other Agnis precede him, represents the heliacal rising of
Sirius at the vernal equinox. There is oveiwhelming evidence, as these
two scholars have noted, that Agni and Soma (“lord of the world poles")
represent the equinoctial colures (the two great circles of the celestial
sphere which intersect each other at the poles). They particularly
pointed to the so-called Shunahshepa hymns of the first book of the
Rig-Veda, identifying Shunahshepa as Cynosoura, “Dog’s Tail," that
is, Ursa Minor.
Vedic mythology introduces Shunahshepa as the adopted son of
the sage Vishvamitra, who represents one o f the stars of Ursa Major.
This appears to point to a noteworthy conjunction of two stars.
Shunahshepa is the second of three brothers, who are given names
240 0 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



that also mean “dog's tail." This suggests that, astronomically speak
ing, Shunahshepa stands for the star Delta in Ursa Minor.
There is a well-known myth in the Purana literature in which
Agni fathers Skanda on Krittikas (Pleiades). Since the Krittikas are
a group of six stars, Skanda is shown to have six heads. In later
Hindu mythology, the fire God Agni is replaced by Shiva, who, like
the Vedic God Rudra, is identified with the star Sirius, the brightest
star in the sky. Rudra-Shiva's most ancient astronomical signifi
cance is that o f the Dog Star, or what Stella Kramrisch put it, “the
hound of heaven, gnashing his formidably bright teeth. ”8 The R ig
Veda (VII.55.2) tells the story of the sage Vasishtha, who, casting a
spell, commanded the God to stop gnashing his teeth at him and to
fall asleep instead.
Subsequently, when the the vernal equinox was located in Rohini,
Sirius-Rudra-Shiva became known as the star Mriga-Vyadha, the
antelope hunter. The antelope was none other than the Creator-God
Prajapati who died, pierced by Rudra's arrow. Prajapati can be equated
with the star alpha in Taurus, also known as Aldebaran, which is a
bright, orange-hued star.
It is clear from the various versions of this ancient myth that
Prajapati in some way collaborated in his murder, and, according to
some accounts, even committed suicide. For the Vedic people, as well
as their Hindu descendants, he embodied the ideal o f self-sacrifice.
Early on, then, Prajapati represented both the year (symbol o f con
tinual change) and the sacrificial altar.
The timeless love story of Goddess Radha and her beloved Krishna
can similarly be understood from an astronomical perspective. Krishna
is a deity of the spring season, and Radha is related to the constella
tions Vishakha (Radha) and Anuradha, which mark the beginning
of Scorpio in the heavens. The full moon in these two constellations
would have marked the vernal equinox in the period from about 3 0 0 0
1000 B.C.
In the Vedic literature, Indra is associated with “bounty" or “suc
cess" (ra d h a s) and is called the “lord of success” (rad h as-p ati). The
M ahabharata epic speaks o f the rivalry between Indra and Vishnu/
Krishna and how Vishnu claimed Indra's spouse Shri. In the A tharva
VEDIC MYTHS AND THEIR ASTRONOMICAL BASI S 0 241



Veda (X IX .7.3), the word rad h a is used in regard to the two stars
called vishakha. Indra is called a “planetherd" or cowherd (gopa)
and is paired with a vishakha. The two vishakhas are paired with
Indra and Agni, who are praised as the two best cowherds. In build
ing the agn i-cayan a fire altar, the layers ofbricks which are taken to
be pairs of feminine constellations, the vishakhas, are coupled with
the masculine deities Indra and Agni. Thus an astronomical theme
underlies the details of the altar designs.
The Secret Language o f M yth
Myths, as we have tried to show, can contain important astro
nomical codes. But to understand their secret language more fully,
we must also pay close attention to the names of Gods and God
desses, in addition to the symbolic motifs and imagery associated
with them.
Consider, for example, the representation ofVishnu as Narayana
during the interval between two phases of creation. Why is Narayana
shown resting o n the back of the Se rpent-King Shesha? If we want
to understand this image, we must remember that, according to Hindu
cosmology, the universe was created out of the primeval waters, which
we have equated with the Milky Way. In an attempt to give Nature's
potential an anthropomorphic face, ancient India’s mythmakers pic
tured Vishnu (All-Pervader) as resting on an immovable primordial
rock. This is exactly what the word n aga means, which is applied to
the serpent God Shesha. The word is traditionally split into n a (not)
an d g a (to g o ). As such it can refer to the cosmic mountain or cosmic
tree at the center of cosmic existence.
However, the word naga—with a long middle a —also stands for
“snake.” In the present context, it refers to the cosmic sky serpent,
which we also know from pharaonic Egypt and the Mayan civiliza
tion. Another name of Shesha, the cosmic serpent, is Ananta, mean
ing “He who is infinite," because he is thought to encircle the whole
of creation.
The word sh esh a means “residue," referring here to that which
is left behind when all creation is absorbed back into the primordial
242 0 IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION



soup. It is this infinite serpent residue that Vishnu, as Narayana,
uses for his couch during the sleep of the universe and all its crea
tures. Narayana, the God whose abode is in the waters, is often de
picted with a thousand heads, which may refer to the traditional teach
ing that a thousand world ages correspond to a single day in the life
of the Creator-God Brahma. The image, as Sukumari Bhattacharya
proposed, may also have suggested itself to the ancients when watch
ing the waves of the ocean rolling toward the shore, which “look like
a myriad-hooded serpent. ”q
Since medieval times, Brahma has been regarded as the creator,
Vishnu as the preserver or sustainer, and Shiva as the destroyer o f
the universe. But in the sacred Hindu literature, Vishnu is just as
often venerated as the all-pervading being who is also the Primordial
Man and the firstborn o f creation, having neither beginning nor end.
Thus Vishnu is taken as the sole source o f the universe, who is ac
tive in all three phases: creation, preservation, and dissolution. Pre
cisely the same role is assigned to Shiva (Benevolent) and Shakti
(Power)—the masculine and feminine principles—by their devotees.
When we consider the figure of Shiva, we find that many of the
myths about this popular deity are intended to highlight the para
doxical aspects of existence. However, there also are other stories
that have a clear astronomical purport, as in the case o f Prajapati's
death at the hands of Rudra-Shiva.
The Goddess Ganga can stand either for the river Ganges or the
Milky Way, which is a portion o f our spiral galaxy and which re
sembles a sparkling river that stretches across the sky. Ganga is
clearly equated with the Milky Way in the Vishnu-Purana, which
has been dated to the early Christian era but contains much older
material.
In her embodiment as the river, Ganga has her source in the nail
of the great toe of Vishnu’s left foot, and Dhruva (Polaris) receives
and sustains her day and night devoutly on his head. For this rea
son, the Seven Sages (the stars of Ursa Major) constantly practice
austerities in Ganga's waters, wreathing their braided locks with her
waves. The lunar orb, encompassed by her accumulated current, de
rives augmented luster from this contact. Falling from on high, as
VEDIC MYTHS AND THEIR ASTRONOMICAL BASI S 0 243



she issues from the Moon, Ganga alights on the summit of Meru (the
world mountain in the north), and thence flows to the four quarters
o f Earth for its purification. The place where the river proceeds is the
third division of the celestial regions, which is the seat of Vishnu.
Stars and Calendars
As elsewhere in the world, myth and ritual were integral aspects
of the same worldview. The stories about the deities, often encoding
astronomical knowledge, were not told for mere edification. They
provided the backbone for the ritual enactment of the cosmic order
on the human level. Thus, not surprisingly, India’s temple architec
ture also reflects the cosmic vision mirrored in the great myths of the
Indic civilization. The temple represents the universe or the Primor
dial Man (purusha). The various parts o f the temple are named after
body parts. The two sides are the hands (hasta), a pillar is a foot
(p a d a ), and the top of the temple is the crown of the head (sh ik h a ra ).
The innermost sanctum of
the temple is the “womb
house” (g arb h a -g rih a). In
another conceptualization,
th eg a rb h a-g rih a is the cos
mic pillar (skam b h a), and
the devotees are like the
stars who, by natural law,
m ust revolve around it.
There is a parallel in the
Hindu p u ja ritual, in which
the devotee moves the lamp
around the picture or image
of the object of worship.
According to the Bn'hat
Sam hita, generally dated to
the fourth century a .d. but relying on much older ideas, the temple
must reflect the cosmic order. The Hindu architects accomplished this
by drawing a square grid o f eighty-one equal squares. The central

rect, this would place the wa r around 1500 B.c. Whatever the actual
date may have been for this massive conflict between the Kurus and
Pandavas, which is said to have lasted eighteen days, it is estab
lished that it took place at the end o f the Vedic age.
Because of the incompatibility between these three chronologi
cal traditions, many scholars believe that the Kaliyuga calendar was
devised after the Maurya dynasty (322 B.c. to 185 B.c.). However,
we must note that the idea of world ages (yuga) itself occurs as
early as the A tharva-V eda and the word is certainly mentioned in
the Rig-Veda (I. 115.2) already, although scholars are divided over
its precise meaning. The most plausible explanation is that the
Saptarshi calendar was the old reckoning system and the reckoning
in terms of twenty-eight constellations was put forward later. This
second scheme then was made the basis of the Kaliyuga calendar.
The antiquity of the Saptarshi era is indicated by its mention in the
S hatapatha-B rahm an a, which is around four thousand years old.
In view of this, it makes sense to base the earliest history of India on
the Saptarshi calendar.
Ever since the time of German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel ( 1770
1831), Indic civilization has been characterized as being thoroughly
unhistorical, or lacking proper historiography.13 The chronologies of
the encyclopedic Puranas have, with few exceptions, been summarily
dismissed as imaginative fabrications.14 It is true that the genealogi
cal lists of the Puranas are riddled with problems, but so are the
dynastic chronologies of Egypt and Sumer. While we must not look
for flawless accuracy over what amounts to an incredibly long period
of four thousand years or more, we cannot fail to observe that the
Indic literature provides a historical record far more complete than
any record we have for the rest of the ancient world. By and large,
scholars have passed judgment on this issue without having studied
the literature in any appreciable detail. Those who did delve into the
Puranas, have come away with a greater appreciation of India's
chronicling ability. Thus the Canadian Sanskritist R. Morton Smith
observed that “the Puranas preserve good historical tradition."15This,
too, is part of the promising reevaluation of ancient India's civiliza
tion underway today.
VEDIC MYTHS AND THEIR ASTRONOMICAL BASI S 0 247



As we are correcting our picture o f antiquity, and o f the early
Indic civilization in particular, we find that the highest aspirations
and the deepest concerns of the ancients still speak to us, and in a
wayf o r us, today. We discover in their symbols, myths, and rituals
a world pregnant with meaning—a world that belongs to our com
mon human heritage. Myths and mythmaking are fundamental to
being human. As the American psychiatrist Rollo May wrote in his
last book:
M yths are our self-interpretation e f our inner selves in rela
tion to th e ou tside world. They a re narration s by w hich our
society is unjfied. M yths a r e essen tial to th e p rocess e fk e e p
ing our sou ls alive an d bringing us new m eaning in a d iffi
cu lt an d eften m eaningless world. 'b
The revivified encounter with the past through archaeology, his
tory, and a host of other disciplines, is at the same time a fresh en
counter with the implicate order of our own psyche. For, as Carl Gustav
Jung and Joseph Campbell among others have shown, the past is still
effectively present in us. 17We may deny the living dimension of myth
within our own being, but we cannot thereby eliminate myth itself.
For to do so would be to eliminate the psyche itself. If anything, the
rationalist effort to demythologize everything is part of a new my
thology that is destructive rather than animating and constructive.
We of today live in the shadow of our own repressed past and denied
potential for spiritual greatness. A new, open-eyed encounter with
the wisdom of the ancients can put us in touch with our own psychic
reality. And, as Jung discerned, the psyche “is the world's pivot."18
For behind the psyche looms the infinite uncharted domain of the
implicate order as such, which the ancients called the Spirit.

crossroads that was reached by the thinkers of India
some seven hundred years before Christ. This is the
real reason why we become both vexed and stimu
lated, uneasy yet interested, when confronted with
the concepts and images of Oriental wisdom." 1The German Indologist
Heinrich Zimmer made this obseIVation half a century ago. In the mean
time we h a v e arrived at the crossroads, and our interest in the spiritual
heritage of the East has unquestionably become more pronounced, as
we are facing the challenge of an emerging global civilization.
What we need to realize is that the East, in particular India, has
long exerted an influence on the cultural evolution of the West. There
fore our present-day interest in India does not occur in a vacuum but
is backed by a long history of more or less tacit contact with that
great civilization.
There is no question oflndia’s impact on classical Greek thought,
which, together with the Judeo-Christian heritage, is commonly ac
knowledged as one of the pillars of our Western civilization. Europe
always looked to India as the great supplier of spices, cotton, and
gems, as well as the land of mysteries and spirituality. In his classic
work Lectures on th e P hilosophy e f H istory, first published in 1837,
G. W. F. Hegel put it this way:

In antiquity, India was indeed a seemingly inexhaustible trea
sure trove for the Mediterranean world, including the Persians and
Arabs. Ever since the days of Socrates and before, the Greeks were
engaged in vigorous trade with India, with goo d s-an d ideas-m ainly
flowing from India westward. The mystery cults of Dionysos and
Orpheus, which vied with the Homeric religion, were known to have
their origin outside Greece, in the East. Some scholars have pointed
to India as their source. The influence of Orphic ideas on Plato is well
known, and, in turn, Plato's overwhelming influence on subsequent
thought needs no explanation.
Relying on the authority of Aristoxenus (circa 3 0 0 B.c.), the
church historian Eusebius, who lived in the fourth century a.d., rec
ollected that Socrates once encountered a “gymnosophist," a wise
man from India. The sage asked Socrates to explain to him the busi
ness of philosophy. When the great philosopher told him that it was
the study of human life, the Indic sage burst out laughing, saying
that such a study is futile without reference to the Divine. For him,
obviously, philosophy was not merely a rational enterprise but shot
through with spiritual concerns. He may have done Socrates an in
justice, but the fact that such an encounter is thought to have taken
place is itself instructive.
The Greeks, who thought highly of their own intellectual achieve
ments, occasionally conceded to looking upon the Egyptians as their
mentors, while the Egyptians clearly regarded them as children whom
they taught. In the period from 50 0 B.c. to 20 0 a.d., Egypt was a
veritable melting pot, and we know that a perhaps not insignificant

We may detect India's influence in the teachings of the Roman
Stoics, such as Seneca (a teacher of Nero), and emperor Marcus
Aurelius. The emperor's book M editations still makes for thought
provoking reading today and elicits in the student of India's wisdom
echoes of the U panishads and the B hagavad-G ita. To furnish only
one brief example, Marcus Aurelius wrote:
Take pleasu re in one thing an d rest in it, in passing/T om on e
so cial a c t to an other so cial act, thinking tfG o d . (VI. 7) 5
Does this not strongly call to mind the Karma-Yoga, or Yoga of self
transcending action, taught by the divine Krishna to his human
protégé, Prince Arjuna?
Furthermore, there is the possible influence o f Indic thought on
Neoplatonism. We know from Porphyry's Vita Plotini that his teacher,
Plotinus, was fascinated with India’s spiritual philosophies and even
made an attempt to travel to India to learn them firsthand. However,
wanting to secure the Hellenic purity of Plotinus's teachings, several
generations of classical scholars have vehemently denied any East
ern elements in Neoplatonism. Yet parallels between Neoplatonism
and Indic metaphysics abound and call for an explanation.b
There is also the added possibility that Plotinus’s own teacher,
the Alexandrian Ammonius Sakkas, might have been an initiate of
Buddhism. The epithet S akkas, generally said to mean “sack car
rier," also has been interpreted as the Latinized form o f the Sanskrit

sh a zy a , this being a common designation of the Buddha and his
followers.
With the rise of the Roman Empire, the Romans achieved a po
litical and economic unification that was unparalleled in the ancient
West. But it was precisely this unification that also opened the doors
to numerous foreign cultural elements, notably the Eastern mystery
religions, such as Pythagoreanism, the cult of Cybele and Attis, Isis
religion, Mithraism, and then also Christianity. It was through these
cultural imports that, among other things, Indic beliefs and practices
found their way deeper into Europe.
The collapse of the Roman Empire had many causes, but one of
them was the reliance of the Romans on the contributions of their
conquered territories. Since the Roman citizens were voracious con
sumers, they managed to create a massive trade deficit in regard to
India, which was too far away to succumb to the Roman legions and
whose goods and treasures therefore had to be purchased at great
expense. As we have pointed out on several occasions, the flow of
material goods involves people, and people are not merely carriers of
valued commodities but also of philosophical ideas, religious beliefs,
and ritual practices. These were the hidden cost o f the trade between
cultures so vastly different as the Indic and the Roman.
The Muslim Connection
European trade with India continued into the Middle Ages and
was invigorated as a result o f the crusades, beginning in 1096 a .d.
and lasting several centuries. The official purpose of the crusades
was to win back Jerusalem from Muslim hands, but other motives,
not least economic considerations, played no small role as well.
As the Islamic world expanded and grew in strength it proved a
formidable barrier between Europe and India. Yet, it was not alto
gether impenetrable, for Indic cultural elements continued to migrate
to the West via the Arabic language. Thus the above-mentioned Bud
dhist legend of Barlaam and Josaphat was first retold after the San
skrit sources in Arabic. Likewise the fables of Bidpai were, unbe
knownst to the large number o f people who enjoyed hearing them,



INDIA AND THE WE ST L l l 255
chiefly derived from India’s Pancatantra. This famous collection of
legends was translated or paraphrased not only into any number of
Indic tongues but also various Middle Eastern and European lan
guages. The P ancatantra was also a strong source for Aesop's fables,
which delighted the Greeks as they do the modern English reader.
Christianity periodically remembered its own early history, ac
cording to which St. Thomas successfully preached the gospel o f his
twin brother Jesus in India. Most scholars regard this as pure legend
and believe that the Thomas remembered in India was a merchant
who came several centuries after Jesus’ own time. However, there is
an ancient Christian community in the South Indian states o f Kerala.
In 884 A.D., according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, King Alfred
sent an envoy to India bearing offerings for St. Thomas’s tomb. In
the twelfth century a .d., Christendom became fascinated with the
legend of Prester John, who supposedly ruled “the Indies," which
was the medieval name for India. The legend fired crusaders and
treasure-seeking adventurers with the hope that once they broke
through the Muslim bloc they would find a thoroughly Christian
empire. When they finally discovered Abyssinia/Ethiopia, they
thought they had found the mythical Prester John in the Christian
emperor ruling then. Many believed that he was a descendant o f the
Queen of Sheba and that he knew where the Ark of the Covenant
was to be found that had been missing since the destruction o f the
Temple in Jerusalem during Solomon’s reign. Mainly what the legend
of Prester John shows is the tremendous fantasy and nostalgia sur
rounding faraway India in the mind of Europeans during that era.
In the meantime the Muslim civilization surpassed its Euro
pean rival during the Middle Ages— surprisingly, in part because it
embraced “pagan" learning whereas the Christianized West bluntly
rejected it. However, as the renowned American historian Harry
Elmer Barnes noted, Muslim science and scholarship were “not so
much original or indigenous as a synthesis and exposition o f the
science and philosophy o f Greece. India, and the East." 1 With the
ascendancy o f the city o f Baghdad, Muslim translators were spon
sored by the aristocracy and the wealthy to translate both Greek
and Hindu works into Arabic. Later the Muslim-ruled cities o f Cairo



256 ^ IN SEARCH OF THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
(in Egypt) and Cordova and Seville (both located in what is now
Spain) became great centers of learning, where the flame of knowl
edge was kept alive while much of Europe was plunged into intel
lectual darkness.
The Muslims were eager astronomers and mathematicians, and
much o f their knowledge stemmed from India—including the so-called
Arabic numerals. It was also from India that they adopted the deci
mal system and the numeral zero. That they also were fond o f study
ing India's philosophical systems can be seen in the Arabic rendi
tions of Patanjali’s Yoga-Sutra (called K itab P atan jal) by al-Biruni
(9 7 3 -1 0 4 8 A.D.). He also wrote a monograph on Indic culture, the
K itab al-H ind, which, however, never achieved the prominence of
lranshahri's less original work on comparative religion, written around
the same time. The encounter with the Arab and Persian world proved
fertile for the Europeans, and contributed to the cultural upswing
that we call the Renaissance.
The disruption of trade with India as a result of the Turkish con
quest of the Byzantine Empire, marked by the fall of Constantinople
in 1453 A.D., forced the European merchants to search for a new
trade route to India— by sea. This directly led to Columbus's discov
ery of the new world, the land of the so-called American Indians A s
is well known, Columbus had set out to sail for India in quest of
great fortune, but ended up in the New World in 1492 a.d.
It was the Portuguese captain Vasco da Gama who, six years
later, rediscovered India for the Europeans. He was unaware that
had it not been for internal political intrigues in the ruling Ming dy
nasty of China, he might not have had such an easy time establish
ing trade posts on the subcontinent. For until 1433 a.d., China had
been a formidable maritime force, which had reached Ceylon (Sri
Lanka) and the gates of the Persian Gulf. But once the reckless Por
tuguese and his immediate successors had disposed of the Arabs,
who had inferior ships and guns, they remained unopposed until the
French arrived on the scene in the seventeenth century.
Finally, in the mid-eighteenth century, both the Portuguese and
the French forfeited their trade advantage in India through Britain's
naval supremacy. The British accomplished what none of the preced



INDIA AND THE WE ST W1UJ 257
ing European powers had been able to accomplish, namely to con
solidate its mercantile interests by assuming political control in the
form of the British Raj. Not until 1947 did India achieve indepen
dence, not least through the unorthodox efforts and charismatic lead
ership of Mahatma Gandhi.
The R ediscovery o f India's H eritage in M odern Times
Whatever harm the British Raj caused in India, and the harm
done was substantial, it indirectly led to some positive developments,
notably the scholarly exploration of the multiple facets o f Hinduism.
This intellectual encounter, in turn, fertilized popular Western cul
ture with the rich pollen of Indic thought and culture. The renowned
British Sanskrit scholar Arthur A. Macdonell summarized the situa
tion well when he said:
Since th e R enaissance there h a s been no even t q fsu ch world
w ide signjficance in the history q f culture a s the discovery q f
Sanskrit literature in th e latter p art q fth e eighteenth century. 8
From a study of India's legal system, which is inseparable from
the philosophical and spiritual assumptions of Hinduism, the British
discovered dimension upon dimension of the vast Sanskrit and ver
nacular literature. Although the first translations of Indic texts into
European languages were undertaken by Christian missionaries in
the sixteenth century, the new discipline of Sanskrit scholarship can
be said to have started with Charles Wilkins. At the behest ofW arren
Hastings, who established the British Raj, Wilkins studied with pun
dits at Benares. In 17 8 5 he published the first translation o f the
Bhagavad-G ita, Hinduism's most popular philosophical and religious
work. He also translated several literary works from the Sanskrit
and compiled a Sanskrit grammar.
The first great Western Sanskrit scholar was Sir William Jones, a
supreme court judge with a passion for Indic, Arabic, and Persian
poetry. In addition to translating the pre-Christian law book o f Manu,
the M anu-Smriti, he firmly established the linguistic connection be
tween Sanskrit and European languages such as Greek, Latin, and

German. The German version o f his English rendering o f the famous
Sanskrit drama S haku n tala by Kalidasa (circa 3 5 0 a .d.) enchanted
the two famous German poets and literati Goethe and Herder.
The founder of Indic philology was Henry Thomas Colebrooke,
who also was the first to provide more detailed information about
the Vedas than had hitherto been available. His countryman Alexander
Hamilton likewise learned Sanskrit from India's pundits and taught
the German poet Friedrich von Schlegel, one of the leaders of the
Romantic movement. His brother August Wilhelm von Schlegel be
came the first Sanskrit scholar in Germany.
In France the foundations for the new discipline were vigorously
laid by scholars like A. L. Chézy and Eugène Burnouf. Soon the emerg
ing translations won a small but appreciative circle of readers. In
particular the first rendering of the U panishads, the most esoteric
portion of the Vedic literature, gained considerable attention and
praise. This was despite the fact that it was a Latin rendition of a
flawed Persian translation of the Sanskrit original. Upon reading
Anquetil Duperron's work, published under the title Oupnek 'hat,
Arthur Schopenhauer declared the U panishads to be the "product of
the highest human wisdom." As L. S. S. O'Malley observed:
The wisdom fo u n d in Sanskrit w orks w asg reeted with som e
th in g lik e reveren tial awe. Thus the French philosopher Vic
tor Cousin, sp eakin g q fth e p o etical an d p h ilosop h ical m ove

he said, beginning to sp read in Europe, declared that they

h e w as constrained to bend the knee before the genius q fth e
E ast an d to s e e in th at crad le o f the human ra ce the native
land q fth e highest philosophy. q
In the nineteenth century the galaxy of Indic scholars included
men like Friedrich Rosen (the first to translate a portion of the Rig
Veda), Max Müller (who prepared a critical edition of the Rig- Veda
and founded comparative mythology), Otto Bohtlingk (compiler of
the St. Petersburg Sanskrit dictionary), Albrecht Weber (who wrote
the first comprehensive history of Indic literature), faul Deussen (a

ture received their initiation into Eastern and especially India’s spiri
tuality through the writings of Emerson and Thoreau, who had pro
vided the American “Transcendentalist" counterpart to German Ro
manticism. They also poured over the ever-ecstatic and ever-eclectic
Walt Whitman who had thoroughly embraced Eastern wisdom, and
they religiously studied Hermann Hesse's Siddharta, turned on to
the poetry of their contemporaries Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and
Gary Snyder, and to the music of Zen-inspired John Cage.
As for Hinduism, it made its presence first powerfully felt at the
Parliament of Religions held in Chicago in 1893, where Swami
Vivekananda was a towering figure. He can be said to have initiated
the modern missionaty Hinduism, which has brought a ceaseless
stream of gurus from India. In the early part of the twentieth century,
the Theosophical Society (founded in 1875) played an important cata
lytic role in this process, not least by its extensive publishing pro
gram featuring translations o f key Vedanta and Yoga scriptures. The
Society also groomed Krishnamurti, who later became an incredibly
successful speaker under his own banner.
The influence of Hindu Yoga continued with various teachers
who, like Paramahansa Yogananda, had made their home in the West.
Yogananda lived in the United States for thirty-two years until his
death in 1952, after having taught yogic philosophy, meditation,
breath control, and other similar techniques to tens of thousands of
Western ers.
In the late 1960s, the Transcendental Meditation movement cap
tured the imagination of the spiritually hungry, largely because the
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and other pop heroes had gone to the
movement's founder, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, for initiation into man
tra meditation.
Today hundreds of thousands o f Europeans and Americans are
reading Eastern classics-n otably the B hagavad-G ita and Upani
sh ads- —which are available as mass market paperbacks for ready
consumption. An estimated four million Americans are practicing
physical exercises derived from or described as Yoga. Although most
Westerners are mainly interested in the calisthenic aspect of Hatha
Yoga, they can hardly escape being exposed to some o f the notions

T hese diverse languages are thought to have derived from a com

European speakers are supposed to h av e been agriculturalists and
pastoralists w ho brought their econom ic skills alo n g w ith them w hen
they m igrated from their original hom eland.
A ccording to arch aeo lo g ist Colin R enfrew , the P ro to -In d o -E u ro

importance, the earlier non-In do-European languages ofEurope were,
with only a few exceptions, progressively replaced and lost. In turn,
the various Proto-Indo-European dialects crystallized into separate
languages.
Scholars have endeavored to reconstruct the Proto-Indo-Euro
pean language, ju st as they have attempted to identify the exact
period and homeland o f the Proto-Indo-European speakers. But all
these efforts are highly speculative, and a variety o f solutions have
been proposed. It is very difficult to point to any one of these as the
most plausible, because the lndo-Europeanization process seems to
have taken place over a period o f several thousand years, as a result
o f numerous migrations. 16
Common Ground
Apart from a shared Ur-language, the Indo-European speakers
also have much else in common. not least their cosmology as ex
pressed in myths, as we have already pointed out. This is not the
place to furnish a detailed account of the similarities in social struc
ture and belief systems between the Indic peoples and their Euro
pean cousins; however, we do want to provide at least one striking
illustration— the Gundestrup cauldron—to show how geographically
remote cultures, namely the Indic and the Celtic, can astonish us
with their similarities.
In 1891, peat cutters working in a peat bog near the Danish hamlet
of Gundestrup found a large silver bowl containing seven decorated
plates that, together with one missing plate, had once formed the
sides of a massive cauldron. The pictorial representations on the plates
are scenes of battles and heroic encounters between bearded deities
or priests and beasts, and they also include a bare-breasted Goddess
and a horned figure seated in a Yoga-like posture, holding a snake in
one hand and surrounded by animals of the wild.
Art historian Timothy Taylor, who analyzed the plates, concluded
that the Gundestrup cauldron fits none o f the archaeological precon
ceptions that have been applied to it so far. Although the style re
sembles Celtic art, Taylor speculated that the fine work had likely



INDIA AND THE WEST W.WJ 265
been execu ted by T h ra cia n silv ersm ith s arou n d 1 5 0 b .c. It is not clear
how th e cau ld ro n , w hich is tw e n ty -sev en in ch es in d iam eter, cam e to
be in D enm ark. B u t Taylor conjectu red “th at an in tru sive Celtic tribe
called the Scordisci had com m issioned the cauldron from native
T hracian silv ersm ith s and th at G erm anic looters had th en carried it

m ore fluid th an they are now an d a lso th at “religiou s b elie fs m ay

Taylor further su gg ested that the craftsm en who created the ca u l
dron very probably con stituted a caste— or, a s w e prefer, a guild
w h o “m o v ed o u ts id e s e ttle d s o c i e t i e s ." 18 T h e s e g u ild s , m o re o v e r, fo l

been created by non-Celtic artists for a Celtic sponsor. In this case,
they would very likely have drawn on Celtic mythology, using a Celtic
style but, perhaps, mixing in artistic elements from their own inher
ited canon, created long ago and undoubtedly modified in the course
o f many generations. At any rate, the Thracian artists had to ensure
that their Celtic sponsor would resonate with their creation. Perhaps
they would not have been able to accomplish this had they them
selves not been primed by the same symbolic world, which is that of
the Proto-lndo-Europeans. In other words, both the Thracian artists
and the Celtic sponsor drew from the same well o f archetypal sym
bolism within their subconscious— symbolism that allowed for the
inclusion of an old artistic motif such as the horned figure surrounded
by animals, which we know from the early Indic civilization.
In a similar vein, we would like to suggest that many Westerners
today are able to enthusiastically respond to India's wisdom pre
cisely because they carry deep within themselves something of the

are afflicted with a false sense of superiority.' We tend to feel supe
rior to whatever and whomever has preceded us. This is captured in
the idea of progress, which has governed Western thought for the
past two hundred years. Yet, as Berger and others have noted, the
price for all this progress has been a growing sense of dislocation or
“homelessness." Our homelessness is not merely social but meta
physical: We are ill at ease in the world at large. “This has produced
an anguish all its own," observed Berger.2
Carl Gustav Jung stated that “modern man has suffered an al
most fatal shock, psychologically speaking, and as a result has fallen
into profound uncertainty. " 3 This confusion is evident in the count
less problems that vex our world, some of which are seemingly in
surmountable, such as the unabated devastation of our environment
caused by a runaway technology whose only purpose appears to be
to stimulate the consumption of goods.
Though part of the world is enjoying unparalleled material abun
dance, the majority of humanity is still forced to live at a subsistence
level. In fact, a hundred million people are starving to death evety
year. Advances in the swift dissemination of information and mass
media entertainment, generated by our bored and sensation-hungry
society, have served to make people around the world more discon
tent, restless, and disturbed. The psychological health of the so-called
developed world has frequently been called into question, and its
dis-ease is rapidly spreading over the entire planet.
Today human unhappiness seems more pronounced than ever,
not least because we have severed the organic root that connects the
individual to the family and to the Earth itself. The individual feels
lost and abandoned, and frustration all too often vents itself in vio
lence of one kind or another. Moral corruption is present in all do
mains of society—especially in the political arena where integrity and
rectitude as well as sound judgment are most urgent requirements.
Religious traditions are faltering under the onslaught of secular
ism, cynicism, and a general hopelessness. Those that thrive tend to
cater to fundamentalism and fanaticism. We certainly do not appear
to be any closer to the Divine, or spiritual reality, than our ancestors
were in previous ages. In fact, our estrangement from the sacred

East, light") is no platitude, for civilization's torch, especially the
core sacred tradition of perennial wisdom, has been handed down
from the eastern hemisphere.
According to The World. A lm anac 1994, there are over one bil
lion Christians in Europe and the two Americas. There are over six
teen million Muslims, over eight million Jews, more than three mil
lion Hindus, a little over one million Buddhists, more than one mil
lion Baha'is, half a million Sikhs, 2 5 0 ,0 0 0 Chinese folk religionists,
3 0 ,0 0 0 Confucianists, 2 3,000 Jains, and 2 ,0 0 0 Shintoists in Europe
and the two Americas. Let us recall that Christianity, an offshoot of
Judaism, began as a small spiritual countergroup in Jerusalem. With
the exception of the million or so adherents of Native American reli
gions, all the other religious traditions likewise had their birthplace
in the Eastern hemisphere. The Middle-Eastern creations of Judaism
and Christianity, which largely have given our civilization its present
shape, were, as we have noted, influenced by ideas stemming from
countries farther east, especially India.
Of all these Eastern traditions, by far the oldest continuous reli
gious heritage is, without question, that o f Hinduism. Thus, the Rig
Veda gives us a view of a pristine spiritual tradition from which we
can derive understanding and inspiration.
Many of us are troubled by the present course of civilization and
are probing for ways out o f the looming crisis. We must therefore
ask about the nature o f knowledge. What is knowledge? What is it
that we are seeking to know? Are we content merely to know the
names and numbers that explain the outer world, or are we seeking
knowledge of a deeper reality? Are we satisfied with knowledge bound
by time and space, or are we looking for eternal Truth?
Evidently, on a personal level, we are not content merely to know
ourselves or each other in terms of names and numbers, as biochemi
cal processes, or as social statistics. We are looking for a deeper mean
ing and awareness than the factual mind can produce.
This is where the perennial wisdom, as long ago encoded in the
R ig - Veda, is highly pertinent. According to the Vedic view there are
two levels ofknowledge: the knowledge of the practical world o f name,
form, and appearance; and the knowledge of the ultimate, nameless,



formless, infinite, and eternal Reality. There are certain fundamental
questions that we all ask at some point in our lives. What is the
Divine? What in us, if anything, transcends death? What is the ori
gin of the cosmos? Such questions cannot be answered by a knowl
edge that relies solely on name and form or time and space.
While modern science has advanced far in the first type of knowl
edge, we do not appear any closer to answering the fundamental
existential questions. Yet it is precisely the role of ancient teachings
like the Vedas to offer profound answers to the ultimate questions of
life. There can be little doubt that ancient humanity was more con
cerned with spiritual realities than we are. This does not mean that
our ancestors formulated those questions in the same way that we
might today. A symbolic or reverential language, such as contained
in the Vedas, may pose questions and give answers by way of an
offering, adoration, or worship. In fact, all worship and prayer can be
regarded as means of accessing the fundamental Reality that tran
scends ordinary ways of knowing. Worship and prayer entail the
recognition that our ordinary instrument of knowledge is insuffi
cient and that we must somehow open ourselves up to, or humble
ourselves before, a greater reality and intelligence.
Today we are in need of a philosophy, science, and spirituality
that are deep and broad enough to accommodate the emerging glo
bal civilization. In releasing our grip on merely local expressions of
mind and culture, we inevitably are led back to considering, as did
our ancestors, the infinite, eternal, impartite Reality. The reason for
this is that only in that which has no boundaries can there be the
ground for integrating all the diverse aspects of human creativity.
This brings us face to face with the need to create a global spiri
tuality that transcends all parochial religious modes of knowledge
and experience. Yet, how can we create such an encompassing spiri
tuality? Clearly, we cannot create it out of nothing. Just as any new
human language, such as Esperanto, is built step by step upon exist
ing foundations, we must draw upon all those resources that we as a
whole species have already created. As Carl Gustav Jung noted, “Man
is never helped in his suffering by what he thinks for himself, but
only by revelations of a wisdom greater than his own. It is this which

As historian Stanley Wolpert put it, “India is a Civilization predi

in the unbelievable wealth of wisdom and metaphysical understand

century German philosopher and poet Friedrich von Schlegel was so
impressed with Indic spirituality that he declared:
When one considers the sublim e disposition underlying the
tmly universal education [eftradditional In d ia ]. . . then what
is or has been called religion in Europe seem s to us to be
scarcely deserving e f that name. A nd o n efeels compelled to
advise those who wish to witness religion to travel to India
f o r that purpose. . . .8
The Hindu sages have turned every aspect of human culture
including art, drama, music, medicine, astronomy, and language
into a tool of spiritual awakening and realization. To get to the origin
and core o f the Vedic tradition is therefore crucial to any endeavor in
generating a global spiritual tradition today. This does not mean, of
course, that a new global tradition will be Vedic or that it should be
called Vedic. What it means, instead, is that it must come to grips
with the essential spirituality at the heart o f the Vedas if it aspires to
be integrated and of relevance to humanity in the imminent third
millennium.
The Vedas embody what has been referred to as the perennial
philosophy at its purest and noblest. The phrase “perennial philoso
phy"—corresponding to the Hindu notion of an “eternal teaching"
(sanatana-dharm a)-w as apparently coined in the seventeenth cen
tury by the German philosopher Leibniz, who used the Latin phrase

phy, he explained:
[T h e perennialphilosophy is] the metaphysic that recognises
a divine Reality substantial to the world e fth in g s and lives
and minds; the psychology that.finds in the soul som ething
similar to, or even identical with, divine Reality; the ethic
that places man ’s ß n a l end in the knowledge e f the imma
nent and transcendent Ground e fa ll being. 9
U n like acad em ic philosophy, the p eren n ial p h ilo so p h y is fou nd ed
in spiritual practice and m oral d iscipline, lead ing to a p erson al ex p e
riential realization o f th e ultim ate Reality. A s H uxley noted, th e prac
titioners o f th is philosophy are the sa in ts, sag es, and enlightened
beings o f the variou s cultures on Earth.
The A m erican philosopher and historian o f religion H uston Sm ith
also has spoken o f the perennial philosophy a s the “prim ordial trad i
t i o n ." 10 “P e re n n ia l" a n d “ p rim o rd ia l” b o th ca p tu re t h e f a c t th a t th is

personal style and cultural fashion. T h e w o rd s also, in a w ay, su g
g e st th at this approach has been an integral part o f hum an culture
since the beginnings o f civilized hum anity.
T h is p e re n n ia l philosophia ( “lo v e o f w is d o m ”) re v o lv e s a ro u n d
a few focal issues: th e singularity o f truth, th e suprem e value o f
diversity, an d the sacred n ess o f existen ce an d o f th e h um an ind i
vidual. Today, from th e v an tage point o f our p resen t place in th e
unraveling dram a o f evolution on th is planet, w e can add a fourth
feature: the hom ogeneity o f hum ankind and its histoty on this planet.
The Singularity of Truth
“T ru th ," sa y s th e h eroin e in S h a k esp e a re's M easureJor M ea
sure, “is truth / To the end of re ck o n in g ." In th is the g re a t bard e c h
oes Plato w ho called tru th “d u rab le." Truth is en d u rin g b e c a u se it is
singular, com plete in itself. Yet, for som e m od ern ph ilosop h ers, truth
is little m ore th an an a b stra ct proposition th at is self-co n siste n t or



that corresponds to the facts, while for the ordinary individual it is
“all relative." Relative to what? we might ask. Speaking from within
the primordial tradition, the answer has to be: relative to the ego’s
momentary desires. But the truth o f the ego with its fitful passions is
not the truth that fills perennial philosophers with awe or stirs them
to higher aspiration.
We have won through to the recognition that there is only one
science— that the laws of science do not change relative to our vary
ing opinions or beliefs, cultures, or customs. Although scientific para
digms change, and with them scientific explanations, there is a fun
damental pool o f understanding that remains intact. Thus whether
fire burns is not a matter of social habit or personal judgment but a
fact of life to be recognized and understood. Scientists strive to com
prehend the laws of nature through reason and experiment. The proof
o f a scientific theory is independent of the country, culture, customs,
or personal background of the scientist.
Similarly, there is only one Truth, one Reality, to be discovered
by humanity. There is not a distinct God, or Truth, for each of the
world’s religions, any more than there is a different Sun or Moon for
astronomers of various nations.
To discover that ultimate spiritual Truth, we must approach it
with the same rigor that a scientist applies to his or her experiments.
In Western civilization, science and religion have become opposed
and conflicting forces. To simplify somewhat, science emphasizes
reason and experiment, whereas religion bases itself on faith and
dogma. At first, religious authority sought to suppress the scientific
enterprise, holding the threat of excommunication over the heads of
the bold adventurers of this new way of acquiring knowledge. Where
the Church failed to intimidate scientists with the threat of excom
munication, it often resorted to imprisonment, torture, and execu
tion. But scientists would not be silenced.
In their turn, scientists often felt the need to disprove religion,
regarding religion as mere fantasy or wish fulfillment and religious
states as mental derangements. Thus a bitter enmity between reli
gion (the clerical establishment) and science was created—an en
mity that has by no means been overcome today. However, there are

now m ore and m ore thoughtful people who consid er the old dichotom y
betw een religion and science as false and unconstructive. They pre
fer to look a t th e se tw o ap p roaches to reality a s com plem entary.
T his approach corresponds to the view of the perennial philoso
phy. T h u s, accord ing to the Vedic tradition, scien ce and religion are
not only com patible but essen tially identical, b ecau se both endeavor
to know the truth. W e can form ulate the Vedic view as follow s: R eli
gion m ust b e founded on reason an d experience. It should not be
contraty to natural law and should be part o f a w ay o f objectively
understanding the inner or higher truth of the hum an b ein g and the
universe. Likew ise science m ust ad d ress th e ultim ate issu es o f life
an d d ea th a n d not m erely co n ce rn its e lf w ith tr a n s ie n t m a tte rs. It

' The Russian scholar Igor M. Diakonoff has questioned the equation of U-ru-wna-as-si-il with Varuna. According to him, urwa-na “is probably the Hurrian plural of the Indo-Iranian mythological term urwan ‘soul’ (preserved in Old Iranian)." He also notes that the treaty lists many deities, with the Aryan Gods appearing near the bottom of the list, which indicates their relative unimportance. See I. M.

We do not known whether the city was the victim of war in the precataclysm era or became derelict as a result of the great migration eastward after the cataclysm, or even whether we have here merely a metaphor. In late Vedic literature, such as the Brahmanas, a number of abandoned cities with Sanskrit names are mentioned, which could be Harappan. Several scholars have related Harappa to the city of Hari-Yupuya mentioned in the Rig-Veda (Vl.27.5).

21 B ibby has s uggested that the Mesopotamian name Meluhha could be a transla tion o f the Sanskrit word mleccha. which in later times came to mean “for eigner” or someone speaking an unintelligib le language, notably Greek. In the Brahmanas and the Mahabharata epic it was applied to the people of Western India, who were regarded as unorthodox in their religious prac tices. At any rate, this word made its first appearance at the time of the Brahmanas and is not pure Sanskrit, which fea sib ly could imply that the Brahmanas stem from the Harappan period.

10 Regrettably, this criticism also applies in part to the earlier works on Yoga by one of the present writers (Georg Feuerstein), which espouse the Atyan invasion model. This error will be corrected in all revised editions of those publications. However, Feuerstein has always favored a spiritual interpreta tion of the Vedas, as is clear from the chapter “Some Notes on Rigvedic Interpretation” inA R eappraisalefY oga. coauthored with the British Vedicist Jeanine Miller and originally published in 1971. This long out-of- print work included the following pertinent observation: “After a whole century ofVedic studies, Western interpretation and translations of the sacred scriptures of ancient India, and in particular of the Rigyeda, their fountain source. still remain extremely far from satisfactory. Many prejudices, partly born of specu lations about evolution. have militated against any deeper insight being directed into, or appreciation of, the philosophical thought underlying Vedic literature." (p. 48)
11 One of the few scholars to challenge the non-Aryan origin of Yoga was the German indologist and Yoga researcher J. W. Hauer. In his book Der Yoga (Stuttgart, Germany: Kohlhammer Verlag, 1958), he tried to show that Yoga has its roots in the Indo-Iranian world and that the Aryans brought yogic teachings with them to India around 2000-1500 B.c. He was half right. Yoga was an Aryan creation, but the Aryans, as we are arguing in the present work, were indigenous to India.

LS Pururavas was the son of Ila, who was the offspring of Manu, the progenitor of the human race in the present world cycle. The name is composed of the wordspuru (meaning “full” or “abundant”) and ravas (meaning “roaring”), thus referring to someone who shouts or yells a great deal.

23 This Vedicpurusha image has sometimes been used to justify the caste system. However, as one of the present authors (Sub hash Kak) has noted elsewhere: “If man is made in the image of the cosmic person from different parts of whose body the various castes emerged, then clearly each human being has an element of each caste in him.” Besides, the fourfold division of Vedic society represents an archetypal ideal rather than actual social reality. The four estates (rather than castes) should therefore not be thought of as a rigid structure immune to change or open to political exploitation. See S. Kak, India a t Century's End: Essays on History and Politics (New Delhi: Voice of India, 1994), p. 15.

'3 In his classic Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Geschichte (Lectures on the Philosophy of History), Hegel displays both intellectual brilliance and over weening prejudice, particularly in regard to India and her citizens. However, Hegel’s bias did not prevent him from regarding the Indian peninsula as the “starting-point for the whole Western world.” G. W. F. Hegel.

14 A notable exception is F. E. Pargiter, The Purana Text q f the Dynasties q f the Kali Age (London: Oxford University Press, 1913), p. 75. Pargiter made a strong case that the current editions of the early Puranas were translated into Sanskrit from an original Prakrit language. These translations, together with the unsettled form of the script used at that time, led to the well-known inconsistencies in the Puranic records.

While some of the claims made by these researchers are too far-fetched, there is enough substance to their overall argument to warrant the hypothesis that Pythagoras was to some degree exposed to Indic ideas.

We would like to state that, though we wholeheartedly endorse Schweitzer's emphasis on reverence, we do not concur with his assessment of Indic phi losophy, which he characterized in summary fashion as life-denying. The ideal of renunciation in India has many forms, including inner renunciation that does not necessitate a cave-dwelling existence. Moreover, reverence for life need not be absent in those who choose to live in seclusion.
