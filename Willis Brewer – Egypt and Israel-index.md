PRELIMINARY SECTION
I. The Hebrew Scriptures, if not so
ancient as was once supposed, are sufficiently
venerable and valuable to deserve a more per
fect and liberal translation than any we now
possess. Great as are the difficulties of a
translation, and these cannot be wholly over
come, there is no satisfactory excuse to the
truth-seeker for some of the short-coming now
presented. Throughout the narrative portions
especially there is a narrowness of interpreta
tion arising from ignorance, or from exclusion
of the religious practices and language of con
temporary peoples. The invaluable services of
Gesenius himself, which have contributed so
freely to Bible exegesis, are painfully defective
for that he relies almost entirely on Arabic
and Syrian for his philology, and even treats
the Ethiopic and the Greek with far more con
sideration than he does the Chaldean, while he
slights the Egyptian almost wholly. It is true
that these latter languages have received their
largest attention since Gesenius began his
labors, but the Rosetta stone and Champolion



10 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
had begun to reveal the riches of the Egyptian
lore during the life of Gesenius, and the con
tiguity of Palestine and Egypt, to say naught
of their alleged historic association, should
have moved the learned linguist in that direction. The laborers who have wrought the ponderous tomes of Webster and Worcester are perhaps more culpable than Gesenius,
since they set or follow the fashion of going
even to the Hindoos for their radicals and an
alogues, and refer scores of times to Icelandic
or Welsh for these and scarcely once to Egyp
tian or even Hebrew; seeming to forget that
it is to the peoples of the Levant and the Euphrates that we are mainly indebted for our
religion and literature, and to them also for
the descriptive and technical branches of the
languages of southern Europe and of Britain.
The Phoenicians first, and afterwards the Greeks, must have adopted and spread much
of the language and practices of the ancient
Egyptians, since a sea-faring people are gen
erally intelligent and therefore liberal. To
me it seems that the influence of Egypt on the southern part of Syria was paramount, at
least to the time of Ezra, or to that of Cambyses and Ochus. That the language and re
ligions of the Hebrews were composite and



PRELIMINARY SECTION ii
changeable seems certain, but it seems also
true that the relations of Egypt with the
Euphratic peoples were much closer than is generally allowed; nearer perhaps than that
which at the present period exists between
France and Britain, in most respects. That
there should be any prejudices to bar the in
fluence of Egypt would be some argument if the story of the Exodus "from Zera-im" or "from enemies" or Mi-Zera-im was not dis
puted by the silence of the Jeremiah in the
pleas of that prophet against a migration to
Egypt, and the silence of Ezekiel in the three
chapters on the iniquities of that people, but
these were positively favored in the Deuter
onomic code (Deut. 23:3-7). 2. It would have been well, on philolog
ical grounds, that our versions of the Hebrew
writings had correctly given the names of
persons and places. We have in this respect
followed the letter and the custom of the
Greeks, to some extent, and that people habit
ually euphonised names of persons and places, or even rendered these in their own tongue. It must surprise the mass of devout persons to know that there are no such words as "Hebrews/' "Moses," "Eve," "Solomon," "Samson," "Jepthah," "Saul," "Abel," &c., in



12 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the original Hebrew. That this alteration is
a serious error all lovers of truth as well as
of philology must confess. Some leading ex
amples may be cited in this place: ''J^^ovah" for lehoah; "Hebrews" for Aabera-im; ''Moses'' for Msheh; "Joshua" for lehoshu-aa;
"Aaron" for Aharon; "Eli-Jah" for Eli-Iahu; "Samu-El" for Shamu-El; "Ishma-El" for IShem-aa-El; "Esau" for ^s-Av; "Jacob" for la-Aa-Kob; "Noah" for Noa^h; "Eve" for ^Hav-ah; "Hann-ah" for ^Hann-ah; "Huld-ah" for ^'Huled-ah; "Samson" for Shimesh-On;
"Solomon" for Shelomeh; "Jesse" for Ishai; "Saul" for Sha-aul; "Absalom" for Abesha
lom; "Jepthah" for le-Patha^h; "Isaiah" for lesh-aa-Iahu ; "Samaria" for Shomeron "Tyre" for Zur or Tsur; "Gaza" for Aaz-ah "Gomorr-ah" for Aa-Morr-ah; "Beth Lehem'
for Beth Le'^hem, &c., &c.
3. Now the vice of these unwarrantable changes, mostly due to the Greek Septuaegint, appears more clear when we consider a few
instances. Thus, the divine name lehoah, if
in this correct form, would satisfactorily con
nect with the definition of "being," "existent," as expressed in the word E-Hieh or "I am," which is the Egyptian Au-A or "I am"; the
first personal pronoun, here abbreviated to



, PRELIMINARY SECTION 13
*'A," standing for Anuk, which in both Hebrew and Egyptian is the same, as are prac
tically all the personal pronouns of the two
tongues; yet I am more disposed to take the le-Hoah as the Egyptian words lu-Aa or the
''Coming-One/' or possibly their word ''He'^h
or ''Eternal" ; but as lu-Aa or ''Coming-One''
we get the concept of the Meshia'^h. Then the word Aabera-im, whence the deformity "Hebrews/' gives us the remarkable word Aaber, usually rendered "pass over," "pass through" (say, "to Molech"), my "sake" or "sake" of,
"ford," and "ferry-boat," thus connecting
with the Bar-is or boat of the Egyptian dead,
with Iber-ia or Spain, with Hyperi-on, &c. The prophet Shemu-El has a name that should
not be distorted, since Shem is a word of more than one important meaning; and so the name
Sha-Aul the first Ma-Lech and first Meshia'^h,
whose name is still applied by the Arabs to the
month Tamuz or August.
4. There is also the name Noa^'h, the flood
hero, which in its correct form readily suggests I-Nach-os the founder, perhaps name of
Deity, at Arg-os in Greece, son of Ocean and
of Teth-ys (Tut, "vestal" in Egyptian) the
mother of the Nile and other rivers; and the daughter of I-Nach-os was the wanderer lo, as



14 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Naa-Am-ah or ''wandering-mother" was sis
ter of Noa^'h, and as Naa-Am-i was wife of
Eli-Melech at the old shrine Beth Le'^hem, though elsewhere daughter of 'Xamech" or
Malech, while in Phoenicia she was called Aashthar-Noema. At Sippara on the Eu
phrates the Chaldean flood-hero dwelt, and the
name of Deity there was Malich, doubtless the Akkad deity Mulge who was lord of the Abyss or Under-world, and thus as son of Malech
(for 'Xamech" is formed by transposition of
the M and L) we connect the two deluge
stories, and Ocean as father of I-Nach-os with Mulge or Malech. And Noa'h is called Tubal
Kain in the Jahvist version, and made an as
pect of Hephaestos or Pata'^h or ^H-num, the Latin Vulcan, as well as Horus of Edfoo the
Mesen or "smith''; but as Ma-Noa'^h he is father of Shimesh-on or the ''Sun," and yet
Noa'^h himself is solar, for the Sun goes into
its Teb or "ark" during the winter month Tebeth; Teb meaning "box," "mummy-case" in Egyptian; hence Arg-os is from the Hebrew
word Aregaz or "coffer" (i Sam. 6:8, ii, 15),
and Ragusa in Sicily and in Dalmatia, argosy, as well as Latin Area, English "Ark"; all of which connect with I-Nach-us, as his son Ph
Oron-eus suggests the Aron or "ark" of the



PRELIMINARY SECTION 15
Covenant. Noa'^h or Ma-Noa'^h is rendered ''comfort/^ "rest," and Ne^h-ath is "descend,"
"drop-down"; and still in Egypt the 17th June is Lilat en Nukt-ah or "Night-of-the-Drop"
when the miraculous "drop" impregnates the rising Nile; and in Egyptian Me-Ne^h means
"beneficent," "gracious"; while Ne'h is "supplication," where one drops down, and the
ideograph of Ne^'h is a pigeon or dove, so that
the Flood-hero Noa'^h seems somehow connected with this emblem, and the more as the pigeon was called Kal-em-Pe or "Bird-ofHeaven," whence the Latin Colombo, a word for the dove species, and as Columbia and Columbus is a favorite word in the Americas, and preferable to the word America which comes from the Latin god Mercury;* and so the dove as Holy Spirit which descended upon
Jesus while in the water with John, connected
as it is with the Jon-ah which brought the
olive leaf to Noa^'h, seems a version of this
anointing or fecundating "drop" which
wrought new life in Egypt; in which land
Baa^'h was the name of the "inundation" and
*I am quite satisfied to advance the opinion that Met
Cur-ius is from the Egyptian talismanic phrase Maa ^^Heru, literally "True Word", but used to express the state of the
one who has this true word as acceptable to the gods. From ^^Heru we have the word Christ.



i6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
its deity, and that from this name we have the
classic Bakch-os may appear when it is found
that Noa^'h drank Ian or Jan and was Sachar
or "drunk" (Asar-Sekar), whereupon his son
•"Ham or ''Egypt" told his brothers Ba'^huz or
"without" ; and they drew over him the Simel
ah, for Semele was mother of Bakch-os. "Dove" and "wine" are both Jon-ah in He
brew, as Men is "dove" and Mena is a "wine
jar" in Egyptian; hence the name Jon-ah is
applied to the famous satire on the destruc
tion of Nineveh, "great city of Elohim" (Jonah
3:3), where dwelt many that knew not their
"right" or lamin (also "sea") to their Semol;
and the A'^heron-ith or "backwards" that the
Simel-ah was drawn over Noa'^h is represented
by the "ship" or Spin-ah ("Spain") in which
Jon-ah started for Tarshish ; the Assyrian city Nina is suggested by the Hebrew word Nun or "fish," or by the Egyptian word Nen or
"rest"; while the "gourd" or Kiki-on which Jehoah drew over Jon-ah seems the word Kek or "darkness" of the Egyptian tongue which responds to the Simel-ah or "garment" drawn
over Noa^'h, for Kek-ut was personified into a
goddess, and would fit the death of Semele
whether dying in the glory of Zeus or in the



PRELIMINARY SECTION 17
Bar is or "ark" in which her father Kadem-os
shut her up (Pausanias 3:24).
5. In the instance of the name our ver
sion renders "Eve" we should read ''Hav-ah;
so called because she became "the mother of
all "Hai." But ''Hav-ah does not mean "life"
or "living/' nor is it elsewhere so rendered.
Strictly speaking there is no such word else
where unless we take A-'^Hav-ah, an unusual
word, rendered to "shew," "declare" (Job
32:10, 17), and which Gesenius says is poetic
for the prose Negid, usually so rendered, as
also to "tell," &c. ; and this view is supported
when it is said "I will make to him a helper as
his Neged" (Gen. 2:18), which might well be
understood as his "developer," or "to show
him off," to refine him, &c. Adam does not
name her till after the Na'^hash had seduced
her, and so it is natural that the Egyptian
word ""Hefi or "serpent"* should be considered,
since it is the same as the word ''Hav-ah, as
the Egyptian has no V. So, ^'Heft in that tongue is "enemy," corresponding with Neged
as "opposite," "over-against" ; and hence it is
probable that her name is one of these words. 6. In the Egyptian myth the Sun or god Raa begets his first children by union with his
* The Cerastes or horned viper of Egypt.

i8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
^Haibet or ''shadow/' and ^Haibet is not very
different from ''Hav-ah. It is at least clear to
any view that Jehoah did not give her to Adam with any intent that they should gen
erate their species, nor does Neged in the least
suggest this, but the Na'^hash taught the
woman to eat the fruit, saying the Ain-i or
"fountains" of the two would be opened there
by, though Ain-i means "eyes" also; and she
ate, finding the fruit, evidently figs, "it like
Ta-Av-ah to the fountains,"* or caused desire,
as Af or Ta-Af is "the flesh" (fem.) in Egyp
tian ; so when both had eaten of the Per-i they
knew they were naked, and they ite-Per or
"more-fruitful" above a fig-tree; Te-Enah be
ing both "fig-tree" and "coitus"; yet the play
on Aal-ah, "above," also "leaf," recalls the
statement of Plutarch ("Isis and Osiris," 36)
that the fig-leaf was an emblem of Osiris
"since it somewhat resembles the virilities of a man."
7. Greek polytheists believed that one
deity could not undo the act of another, but
could neutralise the action by compensation or
curse. So, Jehoah Elohim, who had told the
pair that in the day they should eat of the tree
Compare "they Ta-Av Ta-Av-ah" (Num. 11:4), rendered "fell a-lusting."



PRELIMINARY SECTION 19
they should surely die, finding that they had
eaten and were yet alive, as the Na^'hash had told them they would be, knowing that now the female would bear, told her she should greatly
bear, but this would be in Aezeb or ''pain/'
and that her ta-Shukath (a word of delicate sense*) should be to her man, thus excluding
the Na^'hash. Adam and the Adam-ah in his
Aabur (''sake"!) or that he "passed-over'' was also Arur or "cursed"; and he was to return to the Adam-ah because he was dust, but it is
not clear that this is a sentence of death. The
Na^'hash or "Enchanter" (Num. 23:23) is also Arur or "cursed," and condemned to henceforth crawl on his belly, for he was Aa-Rom
(rendered "more-crafty," "naked") or "high
er" than all the 'Hai-ath or "live-things" of
the wilderness, that is, a giant satyr like the classic Pan. Hearing the words which re
duced Na^hash to the serpent-form, Adam, to
punish or revile the incontinent woman, whom
the Na'^hash had practically taught, calls her by a name corresponding to the new condi
tion of the enchanter ; so, ''Hav-ah or ""Hefi be
came mother of every ''Hai or "live-thing,"
though in Arabic a serpent is yet called ""Hai,
* The word Shuk means a "fissure," a "thigh" (comp. Canticles 7:10).



20 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
and ''Haiees are yet "snake-charmers" in
Egypt, while in ancient Egyptian ''Hai means ''fallen." But Jehoah Elohim clothed the
pair in skins in derision of their alliance with
the satyr-charmer. 8. Adam seems the same as Edom or
^s-Av, the local aspect of Deity in the hills
south of Judea, who was also displaced by the
wiles of a woman; besides which we have la
Aakob at birth clutching the Aakeb of ^s-av who had gone out Rosh-on Adem-oni, and we
have Na'^hash told that the seed of Adam
and ^'Hav-ah shall bruise his Rosh and his
seed shall bruise their Aakeb; a statement
which shows the correspondence of these
legends; and the Shuph or ''bruise" they are
to do to one another is recalled (Gen. 49:17) when Dan is told that he shall be "a Na^iash
in the way, a Sheph-iph-on in the path, that biteth the horse's Aakeb"; which Shephiph-on
is construed to be the Cerastes; but in the
Daniel (1:20; 2:2, 2^, &c.) we find A-Sheph
to be "enchanter," like the Na^'hash or "di
viner" Jo-Seph, yet the snake-charmers did not
make use of the Cerastes; but the meaning of
these ideas is difficult to ascertain. At "Pi
Thom" in Egypt, correctly Per-Atem or "place of A-Tum" or Tern, the Sun-set god, Mr.



PRELIMINARY SECTION 21
Budge assures us there was serpent cult of
some kind, and, as I insist that ^sav or Edom was this Tern or A-Tum, we may thus connect him with Adam. The "giant" or Aapap ser
pent was in Egypt the persistent foe of the
Sun, and hence was the personification of night
and darkness and all evil, for the worship of the Sun was general throughout that land as
every elsewhere; and yet, while the Cerastes,
the deadly '^Hefi, does not figure religiously,
the Aaraa or ''asp" is closely associated with
the Sun, and with sovereignty, especially
queen-hood, and with several goddesses; indeed, was a guardian-emblem of lower Egypt; hence the Arur or ''curse" which was pronounced by Jehoah-God on Na'^hash and
Adam and his wife, since it condemns en
chanters and serpent cults, seems to have been from an Egyptian source, and to have been
directed by the Ezraite scribes or Jehoist sec
taries at the Na^'hash Tan or "enchanter-ser
pent" (2 K. 18:4) kept doubtless as an oracle
in the temple at Jerushalem, like the Py-Thon
at Delphi, at least down to the time of Ezekiel
(8:10), ascribed by its votaries to Mosheh, of
whom they told a miraculous tale in connection
with it (Num. 21:4-9). 'J^he curse inflicted
on the parties to the drama, however, does not



22 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
conceal the insidious power of the Na^'hash, who had outwitted lehoah-God, and made him
self the author of propagated life by means of
that "sensual pleasure" or Te-En-ah, rendered
"fig-leaf/' for which the first pair paid with
the loss of earthly immortality, not to them
selves only, but to all vegetation that fed them
as women were to also sufifer pain under the
plan of propagation originated by the en
chanter; the garden of ^den or "pleasure" being the Pa-Rad or Per-Rad of the Egyp
tians, the Parad-ise of the later time, meaning
the "place of growth," and from this they were
excluded. But ''Hav-ah then bore off-spring;
that is if we are allowed to add to this "Lord
God" story the "Lord" story of Kain that follows or the "God" narrative which is resumed
at chapter 5. In all this certainly we may
observe the advantage if not necessity of ad
hering to the correct form of the personal names.
9. This is particularly apparent in the
name "Samson" of English versions, which as Shimesh-On would clearly indicate Shemesh or the "Sun," almost the only Hebrew name
of that almost universal divinity of the
ancients, and who as Shamash the warrior was
the Sun of the dry autumn which withers vege



PRELIMINARY SECTION 23
tation. Semes-u or the ''oldest" was an Egyp
tian title of the Sun-god Raa; hence it is
strange to find that the only time the word Shamesh-Un is used is (Dan. 7:10) when before the Ancient of Days thousand of thou
sands ''ministered" or Shemesh-Un him; perhaps "reverenced" or "venerated" him, which would hamonise better with the Egyptian
word; and that it has a solar reference must
appear when this genius of the Sun has "a
throne of fiery flames with wheels of burning
fire" (v. g.) besides the fiery stream that came
forth from before him. This description ac
cords with the angel of lehoah who went up in a flame after the annunciation and probably
his fatherhood of Shimesh-On ; while the Nore or "terrible" countenance of the angel was
probably the Nur or "fiery" chariot and wheels and stream of the Ancient of Days. Then the Rua^'h of Jehoah began to move Shimesh-On in Ma-'^Hann-ah of Dan, suggestive of the
""Hennu boat and of A-Don or Adon-is, for the Phoenician "year"-god or A-Din had a great
shrine in the hills of Lebanon, called Dan; and
the original story of Shimesh-On must have made this Ma-^'Hannah more clear than the
Jehoist makes it, since it must be an early mythus of Melach-Aareth or Bes. And so,



24 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
with more excuse, is hidden the name of his first wife, ''for he sought Tho-An-ah from the
Phihstines" (Judges 14:4), as Tanith was the Phoenician name of a daughter of El and Aash
Thor-eth or ''Astarte,'' doubtless the Egyptian
An-ath as they called the Syrian goddess, and
easily Ta-x\n or An-t as feminine of On or
''Helio-polis"; but as the Greeks called the
Phoenician Tanith by the name of the Moongoddess Artemis we may see why ShimeshOn's wife is also called in another legend De
Lil-ah, which seems the ''night"-goddess Lill
ah with the Egyptian feminine definite article Te prefixed, as in the Greek form De-Meter for Te-Mut or "the mother," a name usually
applied but not restricted to the wife of AmenRaa at Thebes. But Tho-An-ah was burned, and so perhaps was Je-Petha'^h's daughter
whom the daughters of Israel went yearly to Tanoth; and such was the fate of Semele the mother of Dion-Ussos, for the Moon fades and
dies in the light of the Sun. De-Lil-ah, who
poetically shears the rays of Shimesh-On, is
noted elsewhere in these pages as the Lil of the
Akkadians or the succubus of the night, the Alil-at of the Chaldeans and the Arabs, who
appears to Abram (Gen. 15:17) as Aalat-ah
or "dark," or as in verse 12 Aim-ah ''Ha-shech



PRELIMINARY SECTION 25
ah or ''horror-of-darkness" and Teredam-ah
or ''deep-sleep" ; nor can it well be doubted that
this is Rer-et or Lel-et of Egypt, the terror
aspect of the goddess Hathor, called Ta-Ur-t
and Shepu-t, whose constellation was the Great
Bear or ''hairy" Seair-ah, or the Aash or "wagon" or "bear," which perhaps gave name to Aash-Tor-eth. On the Euphrates the wife of Shemeshu was Ishtar, who probably suggested the ^sheta-Aol of Shemesh-On, perhaps a shrine of "stout-woman." To connect
De-Lil-ah as "night" with the other legend of
her as Tho-An-ah, we must consider that the
Phoenician Tanith was called Artemis by the Greeks, and the Moon was the symbol of Artemis; besides, Tho-An-ah was of Timen-athah, and Ta-Man-u in Egyptian was "land of Sun-set" or "the Sun-set" (fem.), probably connecting with the Greek word Alena or "Moon"; and the Ti-Men-ath of ^Her-es (Judges 2:9) of le-Hoshu-aa, which shows him to have been "Horus," and the ""Hares-ah
(14:18) or "the Sun" (fem.) in the treachery of Shimesh-On's wife, whom he calls ^-Gel
ath or "heifer," the favorite form of Hathor,
that is, ''Het-'^Hor or "house-of-Horus," clear
ly indicate that his wife was the female Horus, that is, the Sun-set goddess "Hathor." But



26 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the other story, in its giving name to De-Lil
ah, plays on the previous one which tells that when Shimesh-On was with a harlot in Aaz-ah
he arose ''in the half of the Lil-ah and laid
hold of the Dal-eth-oth" (16:3), &c., as if it was meant to connect Dal-eth or "door" with
Lil-ah, making "door of the night," which would be Sun-set, and thus according with her
home at Sorek or "wine-color" (Zach. i :8,
"speckled"). His retreat to ^i-Tam suggests that he was A-Tem or the Egyptian god
of Sun-set. His use of the Le^'h-i or "jaw
bones" indicates that his "rays of light" were
those of the archer Apollo, called Loxi-as,
and hence I-Shemaa-El the archer and his
well of La'^h-ai-Ro-i or "Shining Vision."*
His Ain ha Kore or "fountain of the Quail" shows that he was Melach-Aareth to whom
quails were offered, and the "skin-king" must
have been hairy; the Greek Herakles being a well known phase of him.
10. The shrine of Shimesh-On was appar
ently called Zar-Aa-ah, not "Zorah," and is
said to have been near Beth Shemesh. Zar-aa
is rendered "smiter" from an Arab word, but
*The Lu^h-oth or "tablets" of the Ten Commandments
get their name from the Arab word Lu^h or "shining," as being polished.



PRELIMINARY SECTION 27
is the ''hornet" that went before the Israehtes
(Ex. 23:28), as did the iEim-eth or ''terror" of the previous verse, which ^^imeth seems the Am Mit or "Eater of the Dead" in the judgment scenes of Egypt. But Zaar was "Tanis" or "Zo-Aan" on the most easterly branch
of the Nile, also called Deb-t, perhaps "David," and "Zion" as names of Jerush-Alem; and the
particular aspects of Deity worshipped at Zaar or "Tan-is" was that fierce phase of the Sun called Horus Be^hud, a form of Menathu-Raa; Be^'hud being the modern Edfu, the Greek
Apollino-polis Magna, also called Deb, and
also Zar-ed, also Mesen or "foundry," for the
Mesen-u or "metal-workers" there made the Aten or "disk" of the Sun; so from Zered-et we have Zered-ah (2 Chr. 4:17) where
Shelom-eh and ''Hir-am cast the bronze vessels of the temple, and where lere-bo-Aam was born the son of Nebat and of the widow Zeru
aa-ah, for he was also a head-workman, evi
dently a similar of ""Hiram the son of a widow
and of a man of Zor-i. The cultus at Zaar or Tan-is and at Zar-ed or Edfoo was there
fore the same; that of Apollo or Horus or
David in their severest aspect; hence it is rea
sonable that Shimesh-On should have his shrine at Zar-Aa-ah, as his Le'^h-i or "jaw



28 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
bones'' gave name to Apollo-Loxi-as ; as also
that David should be born at Beth Le'^h-em, and also that ''Heru or ''Horus" and Set should
be the two Le'^h-i or ''combatants." Moreover, Menathu-Raa, ''lord of Man-u" and "governor of Be'^hud," must connect with JeHoshu-Aa, whose "portion" or Menath was at Ti-Menath ""Her-es, which seems the Egyptian feminine of Menath Horus, though Ti or
Ta is also "land"; hence Shimesh-On gets his wife Tho-An-ah at Ti-Menath-ah, as his phase Je-Hud-ah was on his way to Ti-Menath-ah when he met Ta-Mar, a name of Egypt. The "Sepun-i Ti-Mun-i of ^Hol" (Deut. 33:19), however, is not this word Ti-Manath, but
Sepun or "Spain" ("treasure") and the Ti
Mun-i or "west" of the 'Hoi or "disk" of the Sun must refer to Man-u or Amen-t, the "west" of the Egyptians; while Te-Mun-ah
(Ex. 20:4) or "likeness," "form," may allude
to the "disk" images of the Sun.
II. Zaar or Zoaan or Tan-is was the city given as dowry to his wife Thi or Tai by Amenophis III or Amen-^'Hetep ; and she was a foreigner, daughter of Juaa, whose name sounds
like Jehoah ; and it is probably to her influence that was due the sudden prominence of the cult
of Aten or the "disk" of the Sun, to the neg



PRELIMINARY SECTION 29
lect of that of Amen-Raa, which as "hidden"
Raa must have been rather the Sun of the unseen world or the dead, while Aten was that of
the visible disk, and has been urged as Adon, which is the Hebrew word rendered ''lord,"
the name of Deity at Bybl-os in Phoenicia ; the Greek Adon-is, and son of Myrrha by the As
syrian King Thei-as, or of Kunir-as (''Cyn
iras") King of Cyprus. The son of the royal
reformers, Amenoph IV, was so zealous for Aten that he removed from Thebes to a town
he built to the new concept, and changed his
own name to Khu-en-Aten or "glory-of-Aten" but with him passed away the ascendency of
this foreign cultus. With Zaar as her dowry,
Thi must have urged her reformation there,
and at its collapse there may have been for
eigners there of that faith who went back to
their own land, for the Raa-Meses of the
Exodus was probably Zaar, since the Hebrew word Za-Oan is once used for ''to remove,"
and the Isaiah (33:20) tries to make it connect with Zion, as it makes Sha-Anan or "quiet" respond to Jeru-Shalem in the same
sentence ; but le-Zoa itself means to "go-forth," and so Zoa and other of its forms; and the Egyptian Zaar or Zaal has the ideograph
"legs" suffixed to the w^ord; the Hebrew mean



30 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
ing of Aan being ''afflicted," "oppressed."
Amenoph III, about B. C. 1425, has left evi
dence that he ruled from Mesopotamia to
southern Ethiopia, and the accepted Biblical chronology has it that the conquest by Je
Hoshu-Aa was twenty-five years before this
date, so that at the time of the alleged conquest
of Canaan by the Israelites the Egyptians pos
sessed it, and did for many years before and
after. The inscriptions confirm Manetho as to the occupancy of the Delta by the Hyk-Sos,*
who, expelled about B. C. 1500, then the
Egyptians subjugated and held the region all
the way to the Euphrates. But the last place
taken from the Hyk-Sos was 'Het-Ual,t the A-Var-is of the Greek, which is Zaar or Zo
Aan or "Tan-is." They assimilated their Ba
Aal with the old deity Set or Sute^h, perhaps the Greek Styx, whose name Nubti seems the "golden" Sun-set god ; and from that period the
name of Set began to be odious to Egyptians,
as he later became the Sat-an of the Jews, for
he and Ba-Aal were the same to the Egyp
* Greek for ^Hak or "ruler" and Sin or "sheep" ; and
so the Hebrew is ^Hekk or "ruler" and Seh or "lamb" (Gen. 49:10; Ex. 12:3). t Ual Neter Semes-u of Ual the "ancient god" is mentioned in the Book of the Dead, suggesting that the "house of Ual" and Shinush-On were connected at Zaar or Tan-is, hence the Zor-aa-ah of Shimesh-On.



PRELIMINARY SECTION 31
tians, though Ba-Aal and Horus mean the
same, ''in the Above" or ''Over"; yet Set him
self was solar. The accounts of the Le^'h-i or
"combatants," Horus-Be^'hud and Set, are late,
are based on the old conflict between Raa and Aa-Pep, but may have been emphasized by the
expulsion of the Hyksos, for the last battle was
also at Zaar or Tan-is ; and in this fight Horus assumed the form of a lion, and was so wor
shipped there ; Se^iet being "lady" or Neb-t of
Zaar, and as Ma-She'^hath or "destroyer" she was worshipped at Zi-On or Jerusalem. 12. Shimesh-On and David were both
lion-slayers, like Herakles; David being also
a Ro-ah or "shepherd," while Shimesh-On slew his lion on the way to Ti-Menath-ah. It seems probable that the Zer-Aa-ah or "hor
net" that went before the Israelites, and where Shimesh-On dwelt, and who was mother of Jereboaam of Zered-ah or Edfoo, was meant as some "smiter" form of Horus of Tanis or Zaar and of Zered-ah. There is no allusion in the
Hebrew writings to the Hyksos or to a forceful occupancy of Egypt, but ^zeraa and his scribes were Babylonians who lived a thousand
years after the time of the Hyksos; yet their
reduction of this old folklore of the Sun-god in
order to subordinate him to Jehoah could not



32 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
well disconnect him from names which transmit to us his identity with Horus of Zaar and Melach-Aareth of Tmx or ''Tyre." If, how
ever, our versions had called him, not ''Samson," but Shimesh-On, a well known name of
the Sun in Assyria as well as in Palestine, as
Annu or "On" was the Sun-city Helio-polis in
Egypt, "^ the beauty of his story would have
been more apparent, and the Scriptures re
lieved of marvels which when offered to us as
human events wholly discredit its pretensions
to authenticity.
13. "Solomon" is a flagrant misnomer for Shelom-eh. He is son of David and the
daughter of Sheb-aa, reverse of which a ia
Besh, otherwise Eli-Aam. Shelom-eh is also
"called le-Did-Jah in the Aabur of Jehoah"
(2 Sam. 12:25), which follows the statement
"and Jehoah Ahab him, and sent by hand of
Nathan," &c. In Egyptian religious concept
naught was more sure than that the Sun
god "passed-over" in the Uaa or "boat" dail}^
and Uaa-Bar-i seems Aa-Ber or the Hebrew
word "pass-over" in this boat; and only the
* An was also a name of Osiris; Aan is the warrior
Horus in an inscription of him attacking a constellation represented b)^ a bull, and it is possible that Zo-Aan ("Zoan") is an Egyptian name of the city, as Gide-Aon seems also this
Aan of Horus.



PRELIMINARY SECTION 33
elect could enter it (comp. ''ferry-boat," AaBer-ah, 2 Sam. 19:18). Pa-Sa^h or "the Traverser" is ''the Pass-over" in Egyptian, and
a Spring festival of the Sun; evidently min
gled with the Maz-eth or "finding" of Osiris, rendered "unleavened" -bread, and perhaps with
the Spring festival of the "Delivery of Isis," though the two latter were more human or man-god concepts as compared in other places
with the return of the Sun after its journey
through the lower world or winter, as Adon
is was allowed to return for half the year.
The name Shelom-eh, usually "peace," also
means "to finish," "to complete," and at
Memphis the third person of the triad, son of
Pata'^h and Se^het or Bas-et, was Nefar Tem or the "good complete," thus connecting with
Tem the Sun-set concept, of whom Raa says "I am ^Hepher at morning, Raa at noon, Tem at "evening" or Mashel, which Ma-Shel in Hebrew means both a "ruler" and a "parable" or "proverb," and Shel-oM in the name of the
wise ruler may have some connection with this
word. As a builder he must be classed with
worker or creator concepts like Pata^'h. But
another aspect of the third person at Mem
phis was that son of Pata'^h called I-em
""Hetep or "Coming-in-Peace," and in Hebrew



34 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
"peace" is Shelom. I-em-''Hetep, the I
Mouthes of the Greeks, was recognized by
them as ^skulapi-os, the wise and the healer, a son or aspect of Apollo; but in Egypt he seems an aspect of Ta^'hut or "Thoth." The name Ashekel-on or "Askel-on,'' a town of
Philistia, indicates that ^sekel-Api-os was a familiar name there, and Aaz-ah or "Gaza" may be the Egyptian word Uzaa or "weigher," the Hebrew Shekel or "weigh," for Ta^'hut was the "weigher-of-words," and Te^h in Egyptian also means "weight," and Te^h was perhaps Dag-on (Te^h-on) ; though if Dag-on was
of "fish" or Dag form he would more directly connect with Ea or Hoa and Nin on the
Euphrates, deities of the fish form, though in Chaldaic Sakkul means the same as Ma-Leach
or "angel," divine "workman," in Hebrew,
the same that Thoth was and ""Heram of Tyre, and the Greek Herm-es; hence Pap Sakul was the Chaldean herald of the gods ; and yet Hab or Pa-Hab, "the Messenger," and so Phoeb-us
a name of Apollo, was the most frequent name
of Ta^'hut, and the expression as to Shelom-eh, "and Jehoah A-Hab him" or "loved" him, is
significant in this connection. The identifica
tion of Shelomeh with I-em-'^Hetep is recalled by a song that was sung in the temple of Ontuf



PRELIMINARY SECTION 35
(Budge, vol. I, p. 524), a stanza of which
reads *'I have heard the words of I-em-^'Hetep
and of ''Heru-Daad-Aa-f, which are frequently
repeated, but where are their places this day?

Their walls are overthrown, their places
have no longer any being, and they are as if
they had never existed.—No man cometh to tell us what manner of beings they were, none
telleth of their possessions," &c. ; all in the pes
simistic vein of the Ecclesiastes, but from which it must seem the two were wise men of
letters. In other places ""Heru-Daadaa-f is
called royal son, and he is said to have discovered a famous manuscript under the feet
of a statue of Thoth; but his name recalls the "mandrakes" or Daadaa sent for by Raa to renew the race of mankind, hence the Doda-im that Reuben gave Ra^'hel, and so Dad or
''David" means the amorous, the generator, while ordinarily Daadaa in Egyptian would
mean the ''two-fold-Giver," hence Osar-Daadaa or Deddu seems the De-us of the Latins. But of the amorous Shelom-eh it is said ''and Jehoah A-Hab him," and sent Nathan to name
him Je-Did-Jah, "beloved-of-Jehoah," and Nathan means "gift," "giver;" but this must seem a singular combination of the Hebrew
and the Egyptian, and of love and the giver;



36 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
further explained by the Egyptian words De-t
or ''hand" and Du-t or ''desire/' while A-Hab
or Hab in Hebrew, in the sense of loving or nourishing, becomes synonymous with Ab or
"father" or "teacher," so that the Hab or "Ibis" is yet called Aboo Hannes or "Father
Hannes" in Ethiopia and Aboo or "father"
of the sick in Egypt, and the stork is "father
of the shoe"; as from the wise Ta'^hut it may be that we derive the Greek word Diakon,
English "deacon," just as the Philistine Dagon was an aspect of Ta'^hut or ^skulapios; while from Du-t or "desire" or from Tet or "handm.aid" we have A-Pha-Raa-Di-te, "Aph
rodite," the "love" or "handmaid" of Pha-Raa or "the Sun," which seems the Epherath-ah whose shrine was at Beth Le'^h-Em, otherwise Mat-t or "beloved" in Egyptian, and so NaaAmi calls herself Mara or "Mary," mother or nurse of Aob-Ed, which as Ab-Du is
Egyptian for "heart's-desire," the chief shrine of Osiris being Ab-Du or "Abyd-os;" and so in classic legend Myrrha or Mary is mother of
Adon or Adon-is.
14. Shelom-eh or le-Did-Jah, made the son of Dad or David, as ""Her or Horus, though a much older concept than Osar or Osiris, is made his son, may be from his name an epony



PRELIMINARY SECTION 37
mous Deity or man-god of Jeru-Shalem. Shelom-eh may, indeed, with all his wealth and wives and wisdom, be an expansion of the solar hero David, as appears in I. K. 8:66. In the Ruth (4:20-21) we have Salem-ah as son
of Na'^hash-on or ''enchanter," and father of
Bo-Aaz; and one of the pillars of the Chal or
"temple" that Shelom-eh ie-Chal or "finished" was called Bo-Aaz, evidently BaDaddu or "ram of Daddu" or Mendes, called Pan by the Greeks, perhaps ^s-av of Seaire or "Sair." 15. Without doing any prodigies or mir
acles, which would attest his mythical character, yet Shelom-eh must seem even a more certain myth than David. The conceit was
general among the ancients that there had been
a Golden Age (comp. I. K. 4:20. 25, &c.) ; the Greeks having this to happen in the reign of
Kron-os or "Cron-us," whose name Curtius says is derived from Kra, to "accomplish,"
which accords precisely with the Hebrew word
Shelem, to "finish," and with Ie-Chal or "fin
ished" so often used with reference to the
building of the temple; and the Greeks identi
fied Kron-os with the Phoenician El or Il-Ma
lech, whose minister and adviser was the wise Taut, whom Greeks called Herm-es, that is, ^'Heram or "Hiram," while the Italian god



38 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Saturn was also considered the same as Kron
os. In Egypt the star Saturn, called ""Heru
Ka or ''Horus the Bull," of which Horus was
deity, was depicted as a man with the head of
a Ka or ''bull,'' and the Rabbins say that Molech, to whom at Jerushalem children were
sacrificed, had the head of a bull; but the
Akkadian name of this star was Sak-Ush, the Assyrian name was Chavvan, which latter ex
plains the famous passage of the Amos (5 '.26),
"Yt have borne the Sichuth of your Malech
and Chivvan of your images, star of your
god," &c., which seems to connect Molech or Kron-os with this star, for Sak-Ush means in Akkadian ''chief-lofty," Chivvan in Hebrew
is the "erect," while the Septuagint interprets
Horus or the god and planet Saturn as Chivvan by the word Rem-Pan or "high
chief,"* and in the Samaritan version Chivvan
is rendered the planet Saturn; for the Chal
deans, Lenorman says, deemed Saturn the
leader and highest of the planets. In Egypt
it was ""Heru or "Horus," the last of their god
kings, who reigned during the Golden Age, and
we see that he was god of this star, and that it
was called ''Heru Ka. Thus the identity of
*Pin-oth or "chiefs" (Judges 20:2; 1 Sam. 14:38, etc.).



PRELIMINARY SECTION 39
Shelom-eh with Kron-os or El-Malech are more than probable. This "peace on Earth"
&c. is the Messianic hope (Micah. 5:2; comp. Shelom, v. 5), the Christian "New Jeru-Shalem"; the "Moslem" or Ma-Shelem, that is, "Islam" or I-Shelam, of the Arabs, taught by Mo-'^Hamed, as of old peace was sought
through the ""Hemed-ath of Israel (i Sam. 9:
20).
16. Many other instances, equally fla
grant, of the incorrect rendering of names will
be pointed out in this volume. If everyone
was familiar with the original Hebrew this
would count for little; otherwise, in cases
where the reader is acquainted only with other
ancient languages and literature, he is es
topped by these errors from investigations which when approached from an unbiased
basis would tend to relieve the secular narra
tives of the Bible of much of that isolation
which it is so generally assumed that they
possess, and which all experiences of society,
all study of human institutions, go to show is
largely devoid of such foundation.



SECTION I
I
. The origin of the name I-Sera-El is prob
ably Egyptian. The name ^Har-u or S^ar-u* was appHed by Egyptians to some portion of Palestine, and from Shar-u we seem to have the word Syr-ia, and perhaps Shar-on. Sheru
-El would be the ''Syrian-God," and hence the
Bene I-Sera-El or Aam I-Sera-El were children or people of the Syrian-God. Even after the overthrow of the little monarchy around Shechem and Samaria, and the carrying away
of the Israelites, B. C. 720, to the Euphratic
countries, where they forever disappeared from
history, the Jews at Jerushalem claimed the
name Israel as if it was their own, and their
writers speak of Jehoah as God of Israel. But
these writers, in giving their account of the
Kingdom of Israel, which they say was established by Jereboaam who came out of
Egypt, about B. C. 950, are positive in the as
sertion that not one of the Kings of Israel
worshipped Jehoah; and these scribes, who
* The ^H and S^ of the Egyptian, Wilkinson and others say, are interchangeable.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 41
wrote of these Israelites some three centuries
after their disappearance, say (2 K. 17:3—23)
they served Gillul-im and Ba-Aal, &c., these
Gillul-im not being "idols," perhaps, but a form
of the Arab word "Ghoul.''
2. The political union of these Israelites
with the people at and south of Jerushalem is stated to have ended about five hundred years before the return of yEzeraa and Ne^'hemiah, and to have lasted only during the reigns of
the divine David and the impossible Shelomeh
a misty and ecclesiastical past, with which his
toric facts are little to be reckoned. Even in
that account, however, the scribes at Jerushalem show that the Jehud-im or Aabera-im were
not in political union with the Iserael-im, but
were allies of the Philistines (i Sam. 14:21)
till considered treacherous (29:3); indeed, we read (13:7) "And the Aabera-im they Aa
ber the Jordan, a land of Gad and Gile-Aad,"
so that it seems the earliest locality of the
"Hebrews" was the mountainous region called the Aabera-im, somewhat southeast of the Dead Sea. 3. One account (2 Sam. 24:20) has it that these "Hebrews" took possession of Jerushalem, for "Araven-ah saw the King and his servants Aabera-im going up," &c. ; but the



42 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
several accounts of the occupation of Jerush
alem (2 Sam. 5:6-8; Josh. 15 163; Judges 1:21) leave the impression that the old hill tribe
Je-Bus-i were the main element of the town's
population; accounts, however, of events ante
cedent to the historic period, and scarcely to
be dealt with under that head.
4. But wt may see that the claim of these
several peoples to be called Israelites, no mat
ter what the name of their tribal or city deity,
would arise from the fact that I-Sheru-El was
god of the land, and perhaps had a lion aspect
(2 K. 17:24-26), like Malach-Aareth the ''skin-king" at Tyre. All who recognized themselves under this Egyptian name of Syria
as Syrians would consider the god of the land
as their common ancestor; while Sar-ah or A-Sher-ah, feminine of I-Sera-El, was the
common ancestress. Jeroboaam, said to have dwelt in Egypt, who built Shechem, or prob
ably renamed it for Se^hem or Leto-polis in
Egypt, where the Shechem or ''shoulder" of
Asar or "Osiris" was buried, was likely to give his people an Egyptian name, or retain a name
which that people had given the country; but this view might suggest that I-Sera-El was
Asare-El or "Osiris" himself; and the statement that the bones of Joseph were brought out



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 43
of Egypt by Bene Isera-El and buried at
Shechem tends to support the Osiris opinion,
for Joseph is made son of Isera-El. Either
view would support the case of the continuance
of the name I-Sera-El after the deportation of
the Israelites. Besides, Sar means ''prince" in
both Egyptian and Hebrew, and Osiris had the name Sar, while the god Raa declares him
self Sar-son-of-a-Sar. And the tablets found lately at Tel Amarneh, between Memphis and Thebes, prove that the Egyptians were in pos
session of Palestine at the time or shortly
after the Bene Isera-El are supposed to have gone there from Mi-Zera-im, and of course dif
fused both their language and religion.
5. Howbeit, I incline to the view that I
Sera-El means the Syrian-God. The Hebrew word for Svria is Aram, and in one of the con
fessions of faith (Deut. 26:5) the Jew is re
quired to declare ''My father an Aram-i Abed, and went down to Egypt," and was a Gar or "Stranger," "fugitive," there. This Syrian "Bed-ouin" or "wanderer" might, by so calling himself, be deemed a Rem-i or "weeper,"
"wailer," by the Egyptians, and their word Aakeb also means "weeper," "wailer," which fact perhaps was known to his biographer, since Ja-Aakob wept when he met Ra^'hel,



44 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
when he met ^sav, when he lost Joseph, and there was great mourning at his death; but if
this be the legend we may suppose the facetious
author of it was creating an opposite of Iza^'hak
or ''laughter." A more subtle meaning, how
ever, must attach to the name of this ''weeper''
when we understand that his story is told after
the flight of Jo^'hanan and the Jews into Egypt
for fear of the Chaldeans, as told in what ap
pears to me the oldest authentic annals of the
Jews, the book Jeremiah. The fierce anathemas and imprecations of the man Je-Rem-Jah to prevent this Ha-Gar-ah or "the Flight" seem
to me to have originated these stories of the
patriarchs as wxU as that of the Exodus; a
hypothesis to which much exposition is given
in this volume, as will be observed further on. 6. That the stories of Aberaham and
Iza^'hak and Ja-Aakob are late, and a preface
to Jewish conditions, must appear when we
find there is no notice ever made of the cave Ma-Chepel-ah save when it is said they were
buried there; far less any pilgrimage to it,
while the large building which is supposed to
stand over the cavern is assigned on architec
tural grounds to the time of Herod. The Jeremiah mentions Ja-Aakob only in passages
which have been rejected as by a different and



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 45
later writer, such as io:i-i6; 30:—33:;50
52:, and I would add 46:27-28, as well as
10:25, since both are in the vein of later con
ditions. Both the Jeremiah (31:38) and the Zechariah (14:10) speak of the tower of ''Ha
nan-El, built by Ne'hemiah (Ne'^he. 3:1). Abraham and Iza'^hak are mentioned once, and
in the interpolated part (Jere. 33:26). JaAakob as a "weeper" would be understood by the fugitives in Egypt, the Chaldean faction must have thought, and so the enslavement of his descendants was written as a warning. Even Aberaham has Sarah taken from him
there.
7. That there is a long story of David, and that he is mentioned several times by the
''prophets" is explained by the fact that the
name of Jerushalem was City of David; yet
the details of the story of this eponymous hero
seem suggested by the Ezekiel, which has four or five remarks as to "my servant David," who
when scattered Isera-El shall be gathered to
gether (34:12-13) is to be a shepherd and a
prince and a king (34:23-34; 37:24-35), and so when the history was afterwards written David was made all these. 8. But in the Jeremiah the expression
"brought out of Mi-Zera-im" is found several



46 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
times, and in the regular parts. Zer or Ma
Zer, as explained herein, means "adversary,''
"enemy," or "trouble" generally; the Lamen
tations (i 13) using Me-Zera-im as an evil con
dition or "straits," and (v. 5) Zar-ei and Zar; with which compare a woman Me-Zer
ah (Jere. 48:41; 49:22). The Jeremiah's "brought ye up out of Mi-Zera-im" (2:6, 18, &:c.) was not a name of Egypt, nor intended
in places as a reference to Egypt, but to any
place or condition the Latin word Miser or
"miserable" now expresses, since it seems the
Hebrew word; but the Jeremiah, having ap
plied the word to the "wretched" situation in
which the fugitive Jews under Jo'^Hanan
would find themselves, the word seems to have
been applied in the subsequent Pentateuch and
other books;* always bearing in mind the
postulate that the Jeremiah is the oldest of
the historic books. Brought ye out of troubles
or from enemies is what every deity is sup
posed by the devotee to do. The L Isaiah and
the Ezekiel are as silent as to Aberaham and
the bondage in Egypt as their leader the Jere
miah, and so are the minor prophets, save in
*The city Tanis, as the Greeks called it, on the Egyptian frontier toward Judea, was the Zar or Zal or Zan of the Egyptian. Mi-Zer may be from his name.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 47
two or three instances. The 11. Isaiah (40: &c.) tells of Abram and Sarah, and of Noa^h, for the Genesis must have appeared during the
Captivity or soon after, but this fragmentary
part of II. Isaiah is earlier than the Exodus,
since the only sojourn in Egypt it has heard
of (52:4) is that of which the Jeremiah (42:
15:19; 43:7-11) threatens the fugitives from
before the Chaldeans ; and yet a still later poem
of the Isaiah (63:11-14) is after the story of Msheh has appeared.* An addendum to the
Jeremiah, chapters 50: —51:, relating the
overthrow of Babylon by Cyrus, speaks of Sodom and Aamor-ah, showing that the
Genesis had been written; but the mention of Msheh (15:1) in a sermon which appears to
have been written shortly after the Captivity
begun (v. 14), or after the fugitives were in
Egypt (comp. 16:13; 17:4), indicates that per
haps Je-Rem-Jah himself, in Egypt, had be
gun to prepare, as an admonition to the im
migrant Jews, an imaginary account of the
treatment of his people in that country some
nine centuries before; yet neither in the Jere
miah nor any of the other "prophets" or rhap
* Verses 12 and 14 use the words eternal Shem and glori
ous Shem as if the name Msheh was reverse of ha-Shem "the Name."



48 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
sodists save the late copyist Malachi do we hear aught of Msheh; and the wonders done in Egypt and at Sinai are as thoroughly un
known to them as were the prodigies at the
birth and death of Jesus and his miracles to
Paul; and the reason is that ^zeraa and his
scribes had not elaborated these illustrative
arguments, and they did not then exist. But
I shall give further facts as to this.
9. Aam Isera-El or ''people of Isera-El" seems the Egyptian word Aa-Aam-u or ''big Eaters," which they applied to the Arab nomads. The word Shem-ti or "movers/' "comers," "strangers," was an Egyptian term whence we have Shem the son of Noa^'h as
father of all the Bene Aaber (Gen. 10:21) or "passers-through." The Jeremiah (43:5)
seems to mean that the Jews were a collection
of fugitives from different nations, "driven to
Ha-Gur in the land of Jehudah;" and the
Ezekiel (16:2-3) tells Jerushalem who her people were, descendants of Amor-i and ^'Hitith. The observance called Pa-Sa^'h, Egyptian
for "the Flight" or "journey," was a Spring
festival at the beginning of the Jewish year,
and evidently of like origin with Ha-Gir-ah or
"the Flight" which in July begins the Arabian
year; but the Jews associate their observance



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 49
with their supposed flight from Egypt, and the
Arabs associate the He-Jir-ah with the flight of Mo^'hammed, which occurred Sept. 13. The
Arab observance must be ancient, as the Jewish story of the Arab ancestress Ha-Gar
shows. It may be, however, that, as the Egyp
tian harvest is in Spring, Pa-Sa^h or ''the
Field' is the Hebrew observance Pa-Sa'^h, which would explain the curious passage ''And
they did eat of the Aabur of the land on the
morrow after the Pa-Sa^'h" (Josh. 5:11), for
Aabur or "pass-over" is not elsewhere ren
dered "old corn"; besides which Gerah is "grain" in Hebrew, Gar-on is rendered
"threshing-floor," and the Latin word Gran
um or "grain" may be thus derived. The
word Sa^'h or "field" seems to me, none the
less, to be the harvest festival of the Jews
called Such-oth, the Greek 0-Socha-phoria,
both celebrated in Autumn; but the Greeks
connected their observance with Dionysus,
with whom they identified Asar or "Osiris."
Chapter 69 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead
says "I am Osiris -^ ^^ -^ ^ i am Sa^'h, who
travels over his realm, and who journeys be
fore the stars," &c, and Sa'^h was the giant
constellation Orion, which came with the
beneficent inundation in the month July. Amid



50 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
these several terms it is difficult to aver that
the Jewish celebration did not refer to some
sort of flight or journey, as Aaber also does;
but the Ezekiel (45:21), the sole prophetic
book that mentions the Pa-Sa'^h, and written
much more than a century before the book
Exodus, gives no historic reason for the observance, though it seems clear the author had not heard of any enslavement in Egypt, since
in its several chapters given to the motive for
that country's ruin Jehoah says (29:6-7) this
ruin was because it had been a staff of reed to
Beth Iserael; that is, had failed to support
them against Chaldea, as its leader the Jere
miah (S7''^) had said; but in another passage Ma-Zera-im is given to Nebuchadnezzar for his service wrought for Jehoah against Zur
(Ezek. 29:17-20), the play of words in this instance being Ma-Zur or "from Tyre" (v.
18). 10. As I suggest herein, the origin of
Pa-Sa^'h as a political observance very probably arose from the "passage" of Pharaoh
Nechoh, and the defeat and death of Joshi
Jahu at Megiddo, for lamentation for him was
made an ordinance in Iserael (2 Chr. 35:24
25), says the later history, and this by Je
Rem-Jah and the Chaldean faction, that is, the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 51
Jehoists, who are particular in saying that
Joshi-Jahu kept the Pa-Sa^'h; and his words
(v. 23) *'The Aabir-un-i, for I am sore wounded/' coupled with "And they ia-Aabiruh him/' Aaber meaning "'pass-over/' are evi
dence in this direction; for his words seem to mean "The passing-away of me/' which, as
the first Jehoist King, made him a saint, and
the event a yearly observance ; for the Chaldean
or Jehoist faction finally prevailed, and learned to detest Egypt, wherefore Nebuchadnezzar
was "my servant" (Jere. 43:10) despite his
destruction of Jerushalem Pa-Sa^'h is thus con
nected with Egypt, if it connects with the death
of Joshi-Jahu; and that the two words Pasa^'h and Nechah are both rendered "lame" when Mephi-Besheth or "Memphis-Shame" (as lame
like the figures of Pata^'h or ''Hephses-tos at Moph or Memphis; 2 Sam. 4:4) was let fall by his nurse, who fled in ""Hephez (comp. Ex.
12:11; Deut. 16:3), implying "fright" as well
as "haste"; these words, I say, coupled with
the connection of "all Iserael they ne-Behal" (2 Sam. 4:1) with the "God bade me Behal" (2 Chr. 35:21) of Pharaoh Necho, and the "the Aabir me" of Jeshi-Jahu, lend strong
support to my opinion that the old Spring observance Maz-oth had united with it this his



52 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
toric event. It is at least as easy to allude to
Nechoh in the story of Mephi-Besheth as to
Jeshi-Jahu the son of David two centuries and
a half before his reign (i K. 13:1-2); and Elohim who bade Nechoh ''make haste" was
of course Pata^'h at Memphis. And there
might be some further reference to Necho in
the celebration the returned Jews called the
Suchoth when they generously sent a portion
to Ain Nach-on or he for whom ''nothing-is
prepared," correctly the ''not erect" (Nehe.
8:10). Further remarks will appear herein
on this subject, but it must be seen that be
tween a miraculous and impossible Exodus
and the historic Megiddo there is much in
favor of the probable fact in place of the ec
clesiastic fancy.*
II. The zealous Jeremiah (39:8) will not
admit that his Chaldean friends burnt the
house of Jehoah, as stated elsewhere (2 K.
25:9; comp. Ezra. 3:6; 4:1), and has this
house existing after the destruction of the
town (Jere. 41:5-9). The statement in the
* It is worthy of note that when the crops of the Egyptians were plagued it is said the flax and the barley were Nech-ath-ah * * *, but the wheat and the spelt not Necho (Ex. 9:31-32), and this because the barley Abib (the month Nisan) and the flax Gi-Be-Aol, while the not Necho were for Apil-oth ; unusual words, in most cases, and invoking study.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 53
Jeremiah (52:13) is from the Kings, and is
not part of the prophetic book properly, and
neither are chapters 50 and 51 where the
writer tells of the overthrow of Babel with
much satisfaction. "^ The Ezekiel (8:1, 14,, 16),
dating in the sixth year of the Captivity, speaks
of the house of Jehoah as if it was still stand
ing. From what the Ezekiel says of the kinds
of worship and the sacred objects in this
Beth Jehoah it must seem strange it was thus
called; and so from other authority (2 K. 23:
4, 5, II, &c.) we see that it may as well have
had the name of house of Ba-Aal and Asher
ah and of the Sun. That can scarcely be
termed defilement (Jere. 7:30) which seems
to have been the usual custom; for the con
stant heresy of the kingdom of Israel is
averred in the same chapter of the kingdom
of Judah (2 K. 17:19). The Jeremiah, the
oldest Hebrew writing, certainly calls it Beth
Jehoah or Chal Jehoah {y\2, 4, &c.), and if
Jehoah is the Egyptian Aaa or ''great'' (Ai in both Chaldaic and Hebrew), Beth Aaa may be like Phar-Aoh, which very high authorities now say was a title taken by the Hebrew from
Per Aaa or "house-great"; but I suggest the
*And see the interpolation at Jere. 25:11.



54 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Egyptian words J-Uaa or the ''Coming
One" ; in either of which cases Jehoah as a per
sonahty may have been called so from the
name of the temple at Jerushalem, in which, as the chief house of worship, almost any aspect or name of Deity might be worshipped till the rise of Jahvism in the time of Je-Rem-Jah and
Joshi-Jahu (but comp. Ezek. 8:), or the en
forcement of it after the return from Captivity, when the Beth or Chal at Jerushalem ceased to be a Pantheon. The Jeremiah"^, nor
other of the rhapsodist books, have heard of King Shelomeh and his building. The rea
son is that all these books antedate the fanciful
history; which history makes Shelomeh at the
dedication of his temple talk of the Captivity
and the return from it (i K. 8:33, 46-50); and of course the Ezraic scribes indulged both
their fancy and their cupidity in embellishing a temple built by ''Heram, the Greek Herm-es,
since they wished for one like their picture.
Many of the Isaiah poems are later than the return, but none speak of Shelomeh, though one written during the Captivity (Cheyne,
Encyc. Brit., ''Isaiah") has a signal oppor
* The addendum chapter 52, which mentions Shelomeh (v. 20), and taken from 2 Kings 24:13, etc., forgets that al! the utensils of Shelomeh were carried off 250 years before (1 Kings 14:26).



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 55
tunity for using his name. The Ezekiel is
even more noteworthy in its ignorance of the
Shelomeh house, since it tells of a dream dur
ing the Captivity in which the writer was taken
to the temple at Jerushalem, the measurements
of which are described in several of the later
tedious chapters. There was a town, and as a
town Jerushalem must have had one or more
houses of worship before the Captivity, in
which case Je-Rem-Jah should have admitted
that ''my servant Nebu-Chad-Nezzar" (Jere.
25*95 43*10) destroyed it, but as he says
naught of this it may be inferred that there
was then no house of Jehoah.
12. I must point out in this place that the
fierce and persistent partiality of Je-Rem-Jah
for the Chaldeans could only have had its ori
gin in or support from religious bias ; perfected
as this was at Babylon upon his successors
and disciples. The cultus of the saint or deity
Nebo was evidently at its height at this
period, as attested by the names of Nebu-Chad
Nezzar, his father, and the general Nebu-Zar
Adan, &c. Lenormant states that in both the Assyrian and Chaldean systems Nebo was
father of Merodach or Marduk, and son of the
Earth-god Ea or Hoa; but other evidence



56 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
shows that the three were rather a triad; per
haps aspects of the same concept, or the same
ideal in different towns or times. Yet the
cylender of Sargon, who about B. C. 720 de
ported idolatrous Israel, speaks of the chief
triad Anu and Bel and Ea, and then of Nabu
as son of the lord of Shikeli or ''understand
ing," that is, Ea or Hoa, while Nabu is called
"scribe of the universe," ''mover of all the
gods" ; and in other places we find Marduk or Merodach called son of Ea or Hoa, and Abkal
or "herald of the gods," &c. The Jews had
been constantly worshipping God under the
name Ba-Aal (Jere. 9:14; 11:13, &c.). Mo
lech, or other, when we find in the Jeremiah
(10:10) "Je-Hoah a true God he, God of the living, an Aolem Malach," &c., and this is
followed by a verse (11) of instruction in
Chaldaic, which tells the fate of other gods.
The Isaiah (65:15-16) follows in like strain,
as if a new cultus was being adopted. It was
after the triumph of the Chaldean faction that
the Hexateuch and historic books were writ
ten. In these, and to this day, the names Je
Hoah and Msheh the Nebie who disappeared
at Nebo are the great names of Judaism; one,
perhaps both, appearing as Maredachai son of



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 57
I-Air or "light," and a man le-Min-i* or of the
"true/' not "Benjam-ite" ; and the fact that Maredachai in this book Esther saves the
Jews from destruction without the mention of
Je-Hoah seems to indicate that at the time it was changed into a Jewish book the Jewish
name of Deity was other than Jehoah, or that the Babylonian Marduk was Je-Hoah, or that
they were the same, for such a great deliver
ance could not be entertained as a fact in the
Oriental mind without reference to divine agency. But the tomb of Bel-Marduk was shown at Babylon, and he was perhaps considered there as a man-god, yet he may at some other town have been the highest concept of
Deity; and the like may be said of Nebo the
learned; still, the position and attributes of
each of them, as well as Hoa or Ea, are recognized as generally corresponding with the positions of Je-Hoah and Mardechai and Msheh in the Hebrew books, though, as compared with
the fierce, intolerant, and blood-thirsty Jehoah,
the Chaldean Hoa was a far loftier concept. 13. Previous to the Chaldean ascendancy of Je-Rem-Jah and ^zeraa, however, Egyp
*Al-amin, "the Trusty," a name given Mo^hammed by his followers, perhaps originated here, as also that of Amin
ah his mother. Compare the Elohe Amen of the Isaiah (65:16).



58 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
tian religious influences seem potent in Judea.
Nor could this be elsewise if we consider the
mere question of proximity. Besides, as far
back as about B. C. 1500, that is, in the supposed time of the Exodus and Msheh, we yet
find in the peninsular of Sinai rock inscriptions of Thotmes III and his successor Amen-^'Hetep
III, which prove that the Egyptians possessed
that region, and there worked their captives
and their criminals. Far more than this, in
the year A. D. 1887, there were found about 300 clay tablets at Tel Almarick, between
Memphis and Thebes, which are reports to this Amen-'^Hetep and his successor Amen-^'Hetep IV by Egyptian governors in Palestine and
Phoenicia; and this at the precise date of the
alegoric Exodus. Of course no sane man can
believe that 600,000 men (Ex. 12:37) fled from Egypt and required to be saved from capture
by a prodigy at the sea, but it is possible that
a body of captives escaped from the quarries of Sinai. Alexander of Macedon set out with 35, 000 men when he conquered western Asia as well as Egypt. The Jews of historic times were fiercely courageous, and their kinsmen of Tyre and Carthage were obstinately brave;
insomuch that it seems facetious to assert that
this 600,000 needed an angel and a terror and



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 59
a hornet (Ex. 23:20, 23, 2y, 28) to protect them in their flight. The infantile aspect of
the Exodus and its prodigies reaches its amusing cHmax when we are told that at the order
of Jehoah the Nile flowed blood for seven
days, and that the only effect of this marvel on
the Egyptian King was to cause him to retire
into his house. It seems probable, withal, as
the mountain Sinai or ''Horeb-ah was the
''mountain of Elohim" (Ex. 3:1), and as the laws are alleged to have been there given, that this region had some connection with Jewish
annals.
The treatise of Josephus against Apion
gives the names of several foreigners who give
some account of the Jews. The date of none
of these writings is stated. The preparation
of the Septuagent at Alexandria was scarcely
needed to call attention to Jewish claims when
under the Ptolemys many of that faith were prominent and prosperous in Egypt, yet it must have been prepared before Manetho wrote, since he, an Egyptian, of uncertain date, was probably angered by its audacious
pretensions and its reflections on Egypt, and
hence fell into the error of reviving some old
scandals against the Jews. It was from Manetho probably that Tacitus and perhaps Strabo



6o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
derived their statements. But historians and geographers among the Goi-im or "Gentiles"
were doubtless first attracted to the Jewish
state by the bloody and successful resistance
made by that people to the insults and oppressions of Antiochus Epiphanes Theos (Ba-Aal
Piphi-oth or ''teeth/' Isaiah 41:15).
14. Ancient Egyptians, arrogant towards foreigners, seem to have regarded the moun
tainous regions and deserts of North Arabia
and Syria as if inhabited by ruffians and marauders or even ogres. The name Pe-LeShet (whence the Greek name Palaistin), ap
plied by the Hebrews to the "Philistines," seems the same as the Egyptian religious PaLe-Seta-u or "the mouth-of-Passages" to the Under-world; hence their city Aam or "de
vourer," at the extreme frontier, was called by some name which the ancients had as Pelusium, and I think it was this Pe-Le-Seta-u ;'^
and the Luten-u or Ruthen-u appear as Syrians
in some of the inscriptions. And yet the rec
ords still existing, left by Thotmes III., who
claims that he subdued Syria as far as the Euphrates, as did his father Thotmes I., show
by their lists of trophies and spoils that the
* Re-Seta-u in most English renderings, but R and L
are the same.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 6i
Luten-u who chiefly opposed him, were ad
vanced in the arts. His son, Amen-'Hetep II,
the inscriptions show, captured Ninevah. At this period, that of Jehoshuaa as beheved, the
Egyptians possessed Palestine for many years, and it is at this time Budge thinks the cultus
of Ba-Aal was introduced into Egypt ; Thotmes
also erecting a temple at Thebes to the Canaanite goddess Aanath, probably ''Th-Oan
ah of the Philistines" (Judges 14:4), wife of
Shimesh-on, and she is depicted in places wear
ing a panther skin, elsewhere with club and
spear and shield. The cultus of Aashtharth,
the Hebrew goddess Aashtoreth, also began
at this period, and Budge says it lasted till
Christian times; but I will make further remarks as to her and to the goddess Kedesh in
other pages. Of this occupation of Canaan
by the Egyptians, the evidence of which is
clear, the Hebrew writings tell us naught.
15. I will also refer to the extraordinary
episode of the alteration of religion in Egypt by Amen-'^Hetep III., supposed to be due to Syrian influence. The reformation was from the worship of God as Amen-Raa, under sym
bolic beast forms, to the worship of God as the
Sun-disk or Aten-Raa. It is possible that Ca
naanites then resident in Egypt were adherents,



62 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
maybe instigators, of this reform, for it can be scarcely doubted that Aten and the HebrewPhoenician word Adon or "Lord" are the same; whereupon, at the subsequent triumph
of the old cultus, their heresy may have caused
persecution and subsequent flight. Naught of
this, however, accords with the Bible story of
the bondage and flight of Bene Isera-El. It
seems impossible that as descendants of Ca
naanites they should be suspected of an order
to destroy all the Canaanites, but the scribes
probably explain this by averring that Canaan
was son of ''Ham, who is understood to stand for Egypt, and hence the wholesale massacre of Canaanites ordered by Jehoah (Deut. 7:1-2; 20:16, 17) may thus appear as that of Egyp
tians; yet this is not the reason assigned for
the ferocious order (Deut. 7:4; 20:18); an order ^zeraa, a thousand years later, had not
heard of else he would have surely cited it
(Ezra 9:1, &c. ; later, Nehe. 13:23-28).
16. My conclusion is that we cannot date
the Jews as a nationality or separate people
beyond the time of TEzeras. and Ne^'hemiah,
and certainly Jehoah as their name of Deity
perhaps originated with Je-Rem-Jah but did
not prevail in his time. When carried into
Egypt Jeremiah (44:14) told those who fled



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 63
thither that all would perish there, but the
Pelit-im or "escapes" were safe; that is, those who were carried to Chaldea, as we see from
the Ezra (9:8; 14-15); Pelit in Egyptian meaning one who goes and returns, also to come forth. The scribes say Zerubabel had brought some 49,700 from Babylonia about
seventy years before ; but this statement is sus
picious because it was made to fulfil the word of Je-Rem-Jah (Ezra 1:1), and a ''remnant"
(9:8) could scarcely be so many, especially as only 4600 were carried away some seventy
years before (Jere. 52 130) . Howbeit, ^zeraa is said to have set to work to separate the
Jews from intermarriage with other peoples, which is said to have been accomplished some years later (Nehe. 13:3) when the Deuteronomy had been written, doubtless by ^zeraa,
but certainly after the Captivity (Deut. 28:37, 41, &c.). The commandment Lo te-Neaph, "not shalt adulterate," that is, not Nup-tual-is
or inter-marry with other peoples, must also
have been the product of the restless ^zeraa and the scribes who wrote the Exodus and
other "historic" books. And now the shrine
at Jerushalem began to have about it a peculiar
people.



SECTION II
I. This work of separation or exclusive
ness, with its sequence of in-breeding, leading
in all animals to a morbid or tense disposition,
was the great work of TEztvRs. and his imme
diate successors. The promise to make of
them a Segul-ah people (Ex. 19:5; Deut. yiG, &c.) seems now to have been made. Segul or
Segal is rendered ''particular," ''treasure," and
Gesenius connects it with Segur or "shut-up,"
which is Seker in Egyptian, or Sekel, a name
of Osir-is and of the ""Hennu boat. It seems
to me also to connect with the Akkad and Chaldaic word Shakkal or Shaggil, which was equivalent to the Hebrew word Maleach or "angel," "workman"; and is depicted as a
smaller figure beside each Deity; Pap-Sakul being herald of the gods (comp. Charaze, Dan. 3:4), and connecting with Bel-Marduk and his great E-Shaggil or E-Shakil at Babylon, the "house-of-Shaggil." This connection would im
ply that Bene Isra-El was made by Jehoah the communicator of his word to mankind, as well
as his own familiar; and so (Ex. 19:6-9), after



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 65
calling them his Segul-ah people, "holy and
priestly," we find Msheh illustrating this by bearing messages from Jehoah to this people
and their reply back to him. This interme
diary character, common to the religions of all
peoples, is not clearly sustained by the idea of
''exclusive" or ''peculiar," but, if Segal be a
variant of Shukal or Shaggil, then both perhaps connect with the Malach and Me-Shia^'h "Saul," correctly Sha-Aul, for Aul and the
Akkad word Gal both mean "great," "mighty,"
while the relation of a monarch to his deity
was originally that of a Shakal or Segal. But
another variant appears when Ne'^hemiah
(2:6) the Ma-Shek-ah or "cup-bearer" says
"the Shegal also sitting beside him," the king,
for that this is not "queen" or "wives" (Dan.
5:2) the Daniel (5:10) is evidence; and so the Psalm (45 19) speaks of daughters of Malachun amid thy I-Kiri-oth, "and at thy right hand stands a Shegal in Chatam of Aophir," which
I-Kiri-oth is "precious-ones," while Chatham
or Catam in this place, like the "girded with
Catham" of the Daniel (10:5), must be a womanly dress which the Shegal wore, and hence perhaps Catamit-us, the Latin name of
Ganymede, for the Isaiah (13:16), Zechariah
(14:2), and others had already rendered the



66 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
word Shagal a verb which continued to become more odious in apphcation. The Neshe-Chelai or "armor-bearer" of Sha-Aul and Jonathan were perhaps "men brides,"* as it is not Nesie
or "carry." That Bene Isera-El was borne on wings of eagles (Ex. 19:4) by Jehoah seems further to attach this curious passage to the
classic myth of the divine waterer, the Egyp
tian ^H-Num, so odiously perverted from a
beautiful original; and a reverse of the name ^Hnem gives us the Hebrew Me-Ne^'h or
Noa^'h, who "walked a god," while Hebe is
evidently ''Hapi or the feminine "Nile" ; but an Egyptian word for a "workman" is Mane^h,
the Hebrew Maleach in a divine sense.
2. And not only was this exclusiveness
that ^zeraa insisted on illustrated by the
Joshua stories of the extermination of the
Canaan-i, but the people of Moab and Aam-on
were said to be descendants of the incestuous
relations of Lot and his daughters; the Arabs were said to be descendants of the concubines Hagar and Keturah, and the outcast ^sav;
Egypt was cursed in the story of ''Ham, of
whom Chan-Aan was made the son.
* Neshe is perhaps a play on Anesh a "man" and Nesh-ah a "woman;" Gesenius referring Hashie or "seduced" (Gen. 3 :13) to this word. Chel-ah is "bride," "spouse," "daughterin-law."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 67
3. As pointed out herein, it must seem
that the absence of almost any mention of what
appears as the historic parts and personages
of the Hebrew writings from the books of the
prophets or rhapsodists lead me to the infer
ence that these latter are older in most por
tions than the historic parts. At what point in
these narratives we are to seek for something
authentic is very difficult to decide. The ac
counts of early Rome, claimed to have been
founded three centuries after the period as
signed to Sha-Aul and David, are now rejected by historians. There are no monuments or
inscriptions, native or foreign, to invest the
Hebrew narratives in their present serial forms
with probability. Certainly to the time of
King A'^he-Ab the son of Aameri we have
prodigies and miracles, by Eli-Jahu, Eli-Shaa,
&c., which are fatal to historic accuracy. Be
yond that period we are merely in Wonder
land; among giants and genii.
4. Stress is laid on the Meshaa stone, a
mutilated slab found a few years ago at Dibon in Moab.* This makes Me-Shaa tell that
Aameri the King of Israel and his son (A'^he
*This stone is three and a half feet long and two feet wide, with an inscription in Hebrew-Phoenician, of which
there remain thirty-two lines and parts of lines.



68 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Ab) occupy and afflict Moab for many years, but that Me-Shaa made Israel perish forever.
Me-Shaa further says that he built Ba-Aal MeAon and Kir-Ithan and Kir-^'Hah and AarAar; and this identifies him with Reu-ben or "shepherd-son" and Bene-Gad or the "goat
children" (Num. 32: 34-38); and he says the
men of Gad had dwelt in the land of Aataroth
from of old, and that the King of Israel buih Aataroth (comp. v. 34). Against Aataroth
fought Me-Shaa and took it, slaying all the
people, for it was "a Rith to Chemosh and to Moab," and he "brought back thence an AriEl of David-ah, and dragged it before CheMosh" ; which Rith or Ruth or "terror" (Hosea
13:1) was evidently a "lioness" statue, as the
Ari-El was a "lion-god," such as Bena-Jahu the grandson of a "man-beast" slew (2 Sam.
23:20), hence a statue or lion-form of the female David, say Did-o, Ruth, Bath-Shebaa. Me-Shaa also boasts that Chemosh bade him go against Neb-ah, where he slaughtered 7000 men and women, "for to Aashthor of Chemosh
the ^'Haremeth-ah" or vow to "utterly-destroy" was in true Jeho-Shuaa manner. From Nebah he took the Chel-i of Jehoah, and dragged
them before Chemosh, &c. ; Cheli being the
people or priests of the dial or "temple."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 69
5. If this tablet is by the Bible Mesha its
date would be about B. C. 850. We are told that Aameri founded Shomeron (i K. 16:24), and he is perhaps an aspect of Ba-Aal Shamar if not an actual personage; but his name is masculine plural of Aamor-ah, rendered "Gomorr-ah," under which legend we may have the detested Shomeron or ''Samaria/' and
its desired fate, for ''the statutes of Aameri"
and the deeds of the house of A^'he-Ab provoke
a desolation (Micah 6:16). The Meshaa stone connects Aameri with the worship of
Jehoah, it seems, but this text of the Micah
agrees with the historic statement of his heresy
(i K. 16:25); and the same narrative shows that not one of the Kings of Israel worshipped
Jehoah. It is from this fact, if none other,
that we may suspect that the Me-Shaa stone is
either not genuine or is the production of a
period in later centuries, for it is very doubt
ful if Jehoah was the name of Deity at Shomeron at any time before the Makkabean revolt.
But this is not to say that Jehoah was not the name at Neb-ah, which town seems the Nebo of the Jeremiah (48:1, 22) and the Isaiah
(15:2) and the Numbers (32:3, 38), but if so then Jehoah and the Chaldean god Nebo (Isa
iah 46:1) would seem the same, yet (47:4-6)



70 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
we find them not the same. The Neb-ah of
the tablet, however, may be Neba^'h (Num. 32:42), otherwise Ken-ath; but this town's names imply the worship of A-Nup or ''A
Nub-is," as Neba'^h means ''to bark" and Kenaz means a ''hunter,'' the Greek Kuon or Kuonas, meaning "dog," seeming involved as in the name of Chaleb or "dog" and Ken-az at
'^Heberon. But even if the tribe Reu-ben did
build Nebo (32:38; Me-Shaa saying he built Ba-Aal Me-Aon), there is little evidence in the
Hebrew Scriptures that Jehoah was ever the name of Deity among them or on that side of Joredan. If we take Me-Shaa, which has the
sense of "Saviour," as a title of the divine son in Moab, as Na^'hash was in Aammon, Malach
in Hebrew, David in Jerushalem, ""Heru or "Horus" in Egypt, we may solve the supposed
question of the antiquity of this tablet, and his opening remark "I am Me-Shaa" would accord with the "I am Jehoah" so frequent in
the conversations Jehoah had with his people, and such expression might have been applied
centuries before or after the time of Aameri. But no one has ventured to suggest, nor should
venture, that, because the Me-Shaa tablet was
unearthed by an ecclesiastic it is subject to sus
picion; and the point that cannot be reconciled



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 71
is that the King of Israel was a devotee of Je
hoah, which was never the case, it seems, with
any of their Kings. 6. Now if at an early period the people
of Moab had such records as this of Me-Shaa, it seems probable the Hebrews might have had them, though the more massive mural remains
on the east side of Joredan imply a more advanced or more powerful social organization.
But the association of the Bene Reu-ben, per
haps ''son-of-a-shepherd," and Bene Gad, Ged meaning a "Kid," with the sheep-owner Me
Shaa, as founders of the same towns, suggests that the book Numbers was setting up a claim
to Moab and Aam-on some six centuries after
the date of the Me-Shaa stone, and this claim probably based on the Jeremiah (49:1); the Joshua (13:15-28) being no older than the Numbers. Indeed, the Ezekiel (48:), some
two or tliree centuries before, had divided the
country, apparently for the first time, placing Reuben northward and Gad at the extreme
south of the land (vv. 7, 27, 31, 34), so that Gad would be Seair, or border with it, while
the Joredan was the eastern line of the whole
country (47:18); nor could this division be
made for twelve tribes in the Exile time if ten
tribes had been carried away a century or two



72 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
before, for the Ezekiel professes to be written
by an exile ; so that the whole story as to there
having been twelve tribes is thus rendered per
plexing. 7. A doubt has generated in my mind that
the twelve tribes were rather a religious idea,
based on the solar and lunar phenomena, than
a historic fact. That the Sun was the original of Ba-Aal and other Hebrew names of Deity
there can be little doubt (Ezek. 8:16, &c.). New Moon and Sabath were equally sacred. The
dream of Joseph (Gen. 37:9-10), in which his parents and eleven brothers were as Sun and
Moon and stars to prostrate to him, may dis
play a knowledge by the writer that Joseph as
eleventh son was the eleventh month Shebat or Shebad (January-February), the month of rain and thick clouds on the Purat or Euphrates, and thus connecting nominally with the Egyp
tian star Seped or "Sirius," which heralded the
inundation there; but in the month Shebat the celestial bodies are over-shadowed. The fourth
son of Ja-Aakob was Je-Hud-ah, and the fourth month was Tam-Uz (Ezek. 8:14) as with the Syrians, but the Shawal ("SauF') of the Arabs, and the Duz of the Assyrians and Chaldeans ; and it was Du-zi in the Shades for
whom Ishtar made her descent in the Chaldean



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 73
epic, and the same as Je-Hud-ah who was rescued by Eseter or Hadas-ah from the Agag Haman, whom Sha-Aul or ''Saul'' had also punished as Agag; the massacre of Aamalek
being for that he set himself "in the way of the ascent from Mi-Zera-im/' where doubt
less Zer-Esh the wife of Haman ruled; but this
massacre and that of the Persians were evi
dently suggested by that of Hamon-Gog in the
Ezekiel (39) ; and, in any event, the idejitity of Du-zi and Jehud-ah and Sha-Aul is thus made out, with "the Tam-Uz" also, as the Sun of Summer, called Shamash by the Chaldeans and so Shimesh-on who like Jehud-ah found
his deceitful wife at Ti-Men-ath-ah, the Egyp
tian Ta-Manu or "land-of-Sun-set," the place
where Jehoshuaa was buried (Judges 2 19) ; for the Sun-set goddess was evidently the Hades-queen, and easily Men-ah the "por
tioner'' of time, the Mene or "Moon" and Men
or "month" of the Greek, with many shrines in Canaan ; and the name A-Lil-at or "nightsgoddess was usually applied to her in Arabia,
hence De-Lill-ah, the Egyptian Lel-et; and
vShimesh-on as a lion-slayer accords with Je
hudah as the lion in the death-song of his
father (Gen. 49:9-12); both being aspects of Melach Aareth or the "skin-king" at Tyre, the



74 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Greek Her-Akles, the Egyptian ''Heru-Akel or
*TIorus" under his aspect of Akel or Hon-god. The supplementary five days of Ja-Aakob's
children were probably represented by the daughter Din-ah, whose name seems the Chaldean word A-Din or Ai-Din ( Dan. 2 : 1 5 ; 7 125 )
''then'' or ''that time," and connecting with
the harsher form A-Dar or "enlarged," hence
Ve-Adar or "and Adar" the Jewish additional
month, called by Egyptians "additional" or Haru, whence perhaps the Hebrew word Herah or "pregnant," "conceived" ; and so the Hebrew
Dar or Dor-eth, ''age," "posterity," "genera
tion."
8. It is true that the names of the twelve
sons of Ja-Aakob fail to be those of the Jewish months, but the months were apparently called by their number till the names of the Chaldean months were adopted. That the Chaldeans
had, among their legion of genii, a patron saint for each month, we may be certain. The Per
sians had them, and their word Era, "to pro
tect," and "first," accords with the Greek word Pro or "before," and so U-Fratu is perhaps
"good-first" or first good, and so the Greek form Eu-Phrates ; and King Phraortes is from Fravartish which is the name of the Persian
protecting geni of the Jewish first month



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 75
Nisan. The six Amesha Spentas or ''im
mortal saints" who attended the great Deity Ahura-Mazadao were protectors of so many months, and the famous Mithra was guardian
of the Jewish seventh month Tisheri, which F. Lenormant suggests is a name from a Chal
dean word for "sanctuary," in which case we
have the Jewish observances Suchoth or "tents" and day of Chepher or "atonement" as
solemnities for the departing Sun, or "Sun
brilliance" as Lenormant interprets the Ak
kadic Amar-Atuki or Marduk, as they occur
in Tisheri. And the genius of the month
Shebat (Jan.-Feby.) was Vohu-Manu or "good-mind," one of the six, corrupted to "Bahman"; while the next month Adar was
that of Spenta Armaiti or "holy Armaiti," who
presided over all vegetation and husbandry, and in fact was the great Nature-Mother, evi
dently the Assyrian Sem-Iram-is as the Greeks
called her since she was the Sum-at or "dove"
borne "high" or A-Ram on the banners of Nineveh and Ashur,* and an aspect of the
Babylonian Ishtar or "Esther." But the
names of none of the six "angels" or I-Zeds
(comp. Nimrod as a Gibbor Zaid) of Angro
* Hence the Jonah or "dove" sword (Jere. 46:13, 16).



76 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Mainyu or ''dark mind" appear as protectors of the months.
9. In Egypt we find several of the leading
deities or saints in service as protectors of the
month, but scarcely any of the months are the
same in name as these guardians. The fact that the Egyptian harvest was in Spring and
their seed-time in Autumn necessarily obscures
the connection with the Asiatics. A conspicu
ous exception occurs in the fourth month or
Tam-Uz of the Jewish calendar, for the great
Memphian smith-god Pata'^h is its protector;
thus connecting him with the fourth son Je-Hud-ah, and with the names Tam-Uz and Shawal and Duz which as said the western Asiatics give to the month August-September, when the Fire-God or "drouth" (Ja-Besh)God, Bes or Je-Bus, Molech, &c., parches
Earth, for Bes means "fire" in Egyptian, and Je-Bush means "maker" in Chaldean; but
when, after the time of Exile, the Jeremiah
(3:24, 25; II :i3), urged the cultus of Jehoah, Besh-eth became "shameful-thing," while the
scribes of course made Je-Petha''h the son of
a harlot (Judges 11 :i), though no doubt the
daughters of Isera-El still went yearly to Tan
ath the daughter of le-Petha'^h (v. 40).
10. It thus seems that the story of the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 77
twelve tribes or sons of la-Aakob was first sug
gested by the fanciful book Ezekiel, and adopted when the Hexateuch and other purported history was written by the hierarchy.
The story is too systematic to be a record of human events. le-Bus was a rocky stronghold, and in the barren region which outlaws
and dervishes are likely to take refuge; hence
it developed after some centuries a fierce and
fanatical people. The shrine of the fiery god Bes or Je-Bus was almost as sacred to the peo
ple as that of its prototype at Tyre, w^hich city
submitted to Alexander after the defeat of
Darius at Issus, but shut its gates against him
and withstood a siege of seven months, ending
in destruction, because he required that he should enter the temple of Melach-Aareth.
The book of Judges records the story of old
local deities or saints or demi-gods, and the
books of Samuel are similar, only they are
more elaborate as to the like personages, called Shemu-El and Sha-Aul and David. The books of Kings give much attention to the monarchy at Shechem and Shomeron, though written
after the Captivity when the cultus of Jehoah
prevailed, and when the greatest crime was to worship elsewhere than at Jerushalem (i K.
14:21-23, &c., &c.) ; and the object of the books



78 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
is wholly religious. The effect of this single
purpose is that facts are so presented that their
original nature and sequence are scarcely trace
able. I question, for instance, that the word
Jah or Jeho was a part of the name of the list
of monarchs and priests till the time of Josiah
(loshi-Iahu, ''founder-of-Jehoah"), about which time perhaps Jehoah became a prominent name of Deity, though it is more probable that
this happened after the return of ^zeraa ; and
the names, where they are of actual persons,
were perhaps coupled with El or Ba-Aal in
place of lah or Jahu, and so the son of Re^hoboaam is Abi-Jam in the Kings and Abi
jah in the Chronicles ; but, as all this purported
history was written by the priests of Jehoah
after the Exile, the form of the name was at
their disposal.
II. Before the return, however, it seems
probable that the fierce dervish and scribe le
Rem-Iahu or "Exalter-of-Jehoah" was the
leader of the Jehoa-ists, as the scribes of the
after times made him the hero of some verses
of the Isaiah (52: 13—53:), beginning "Be
hold my servant shall be wise, exalted,'' and
''exalted" is Je-Rom, for Je-Rem-Jah was prob
ably put to death at Ta'^hapanes.* The books
* The use of Mach-Aboth and Mach-Abin, rendered "sor



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 79
called Kings make all the monarchs of Israel
or ''Samaria" worshippers of Apis or the bull
aspect of Deity, and occasionally, as in case of
Jehue, hostile to Ba-Aal, against whom there
seemed to have been occasional revolts in Jerushalem; but as Molech (Jere. 19:5) Ba-Aal
probably had the bull aspect. Yet the Jahvists,
who detested Samaria, summed up as the cause
of its earlier Captivity (2 K. 17:6-23), with
the assertion (v. 19) that Judah had done like
wise.
12. The books called Chronicles are
among the latest of the Hebrew Scriptures.
They are written solely in the interests of the
theocracy at Jerushalem, and possess no his
torical value whatever. They exaggerate
every incident which elevates the ecclesiastical
body at Jerushalem, and invent others than
those of the books of Kings in order to fortify
the assumptions of the priesthood there. Thus
we find the speech of Abi-Jah against Jere
rows" (Isaiah 53:3, 4) points to the person there depicted as
Makkabe-os, the brave Jew who led against Antiochus Epiphanes Theos, the Ba-Aal Piphi-oth or "teeth" of the Isaiah (41:15), whose name Makkab-os is only found in this Greek
form ; and it may mean "smiter-spirit" or "stricken-spirit" (comp. Much-ah of Elohim, v. 4), while the Daniel (12:1) calls him Micha-El. But Makkabe-os probably was familiar
with and took name from the Isaiah. The chronicler (I Chron.
12:13) was seemingly of my opinion, and he makes him or them Gad-i or of the "goat"-skin wearers.



8o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
boaam, and the slaughter of half a million of
the Samaritans in one battle, as new matter,
and the reason for the invention will be found
in the speech (2 Chron. 13:9-10). Because Shelomeh built the temple at Jerushalem the
Chronicler knows naught of his apostasy, and
for the like connection with the temple naught is said of David's villainy toward Auriah or
his flight from Abeshalom. The Chronicler
also supplies a marvelous fiction in favor of
the successor of Abi-Jah, Asa, who had in the
book of Kings brought vessels of gold and sil
ver into the house of Jehoah, and Asa with half a million chosen men defeats an Ethiopian
army of a million, of whom "there fell (so)
that none lived" ; and then the story reverts to
that of the Kings, and the mighty Asa is fain
to buy the help of Damascus against the petty
people of Samaria; nor does the Chronicler
know of the great pit Asa made for fear of
Ba-Aasha (Jere. 41 :g) ; yet his successor Jeho-Shephat had 1,160,000 men of war, besides garrisons (2 Chron. 17:13-19) ; and with
all the virtues of this Jeho-Shephat, whose
career occupies ten verses of i Kings, and is
expanded to four chapters by the Chronicler,
and despite the ferocious covenant made by his
grandfather Asa and the people (2 Chron. 15:



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 8i
13), their successor forsook Jehoah, and the Arabs and PhiHstines plundered Jerushalem
as if the milHon or so Gibor-i ""Hail of his
father had died with him. The Chronicler is
also too devout to allow the peaceable reign of
Ma-Nashah for fifty-odd years, and so sen
tences him to captivity at Babylon till he con
sents to worship Jehoah. The power of the
priesthood is displayed in these pseudo Chron
icles, w^hich omit the stories of Eli-Jahu and
Eli-Shaa, evidently because long before they
were written the shrine at Charmel, consulted
as an oracle by Vespasian a generation after
the Crucifixion, was a formidable rival of the
temple at Jerushalem. Besides, in the Chron
icles it is the priest who has control of sacred
and occult things, and the Nebie or ''prophet"
of the Samuel and the Kings had been superseded at Jerushalem, though perhaps not
among the rustics of Galilee.
13. These older books seem to have been
prepared after the flight of Jo^'hanan into Egypt, against the anathemas of le-Rem
Jah, as ''came into" (2 K. 23:34; 25:26; Jere. 43:7) imports, as compare "carried away" (2 K. 25:21) to Babylon; and this migration oc
curred about B. C. 585. The Chronicles are the production of the haughty and fierce priest



82 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
hood a century or two before Christ, and the
Ezra-Nehemiah is considered part of them or
by the same hands.
14. The number carried into the famous
Exile or Captivity is itemised and summed up
as 4600 (Jere. 52:28-30). It is distinctly said
(2 K. 25:26; Jere. 43:4-6) that all the remaining population migrated to Egypt, and this must have been a larger number. "And a cap
tive Jehudah from over his land" (2 K. 25 :2i) must have been written by the same Jahvist who says (24:14; 25 : 12) "None remained save the Deleth of the land." An addendum to the
Jeremiah, its chapter 52, seems to have a
curious interpolation from the other side, verse 15 beginning "And the Mi-Deloth of the peo
ple, and the residue of the people left in the
city, and the remnant of the fallen who fell to
the King of Babylon, and the residue of the
Amon,''' to the captive of Nebu-Zar-Adan" ; but
the next verse corrects this attack on the Phar
isees and scribes of Babylonia. Contra, the
Jeremiah (43:5) bitterly tells who fled to
Egypt, saying "Jo-'^Hanan took all the re
mainder of Jehudah which they came back
from all nations which cast them out to wan
* Ha-Amon or Ha-Man is a severe word in the mouth of a Jew.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 83
der in the land Jehudah." But I suggest that
Deleth or Mi-Deleth be reversed, since it is
not rendered "poor'' elsewhere than in these instances, whereupon we have ''birth," "gen
erations," ''begat," and the reference is then
to the "natives," the Thelad-im inhabitants or Canaan-i; the Goi-im that were round about
Ne'^hem-Jah, and who cried out against their
brethren the Jehud-im (Nehe. 5:1, &c.), who
thus seem to have the attitude of foreigners. The emigrants to Egypt were worshippers of the Queen of Heaven after they arrived there
(Jere. 4.4.: 15), and were formerly so, as well
as their rulers and fathers (v. 17), and speak
to Je-Rem-Iah of Jehoah "thy god" (42:2, 3). 15. It seems probable that Je-Rem-Jah was more than canonized by the Jahvists. He is probably the "of Libenah," as well as "of Anath-oth"; in which case his sister Hamital
was wife of "Josiah" or Joshi-Jahu and mother of the last king "Zekekiah" or Zideki-Jahu.
The sudden conversion and zeal of Josiah, if
conceded, were perhaps under the influence of
Je-Rem-Jah, who must also have influenced the young prince to espouse the Chaldean in
terest, and attack Necho; and Josiah was not only made divine, but his advent was made the
subject of prophecy (2 Chron. 35:25; i K.



84 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
13:2). The hierophant of Jehoah, however, was le-Rem-Jah or ''ExaUer-of-Jehoah" (comp. 2 Chron. 36:12), who made of JoshiJahu the man-god and martyr, and thus begun
or at least revived the cultus of Jehoah, for the
Chaldean faction at length triumphed. In
deed; the Zechariah (12:11), in one of its last
six chapters, which Wellhausen holds are later
than the Makkabean war, refers to Josiah as Hadad-Rimmon, seemingly identifying him with the name of Deity at Damascus (2 K. 5:18), the Ramanu of Chaldea and Assyria;
but in such case of apotheosis we must find
that Jehoah was at the first a subordinate type
of Deity, as in case of Jesus.
16. Herodotus (2:159), writing about
B. C. 450, is the first extant writer to mention
Israelite history. He says Necho, coming to an engagement with the Syrians at Magdolus, "conquered them, and after the battle took
Kadytus, a large city in Syria." Magdolus is understood as Megiddo, and some have supposed Kadytus to be Kadesh or ''holy" as a
name of Jerushalem, but Necho does not appear to have taken Jerushalem, while the city
Katesh in the inscriptions of Raameses II. is
placed on a river.
17. Some eighty years prior to Josiah



Bes or ^Hi, from the Kgyptian Inscription. Identified in this book with Melak-Aoreth of Tyre, with Je-Bus or Ja-Bez of
Jerushalem, with Shimeshon of the west coast of Israel,
with ^sav, with ^Hi-El of Jericho, with the Greek Herakles, &c.



86 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
there was a King of Judah called ''Hizek-Jahu,
also dear to the Jahvists, who tell incredible
stories of him. An inscribed cylender of an
Assyrian monarch, Sin-aki-Irib, relates that he
carried on a successful invasion of Palestine,
about B. C. 700, took forty-six cities from
''Hizek-Jahu, shut him up in Jerushalem, ex
acted a very large booty of him, and deported
200,150 of the inhabitants of the country. The Jewish account agrees as to the payment of the
large tribute, but says the Assyrians insisted
upon entering the town, whereupon a ''proph
et" name Isaiah came with his ''thus saith
Jehoah'' to announce that the God forbade the
entry of the foe; and so, that night, the
Maleach of Jehoah went into the camp of the Assyrians and smote 185,000, "and when they
arose in the morning, behold, all of them
corpses dead.'' It is not stated what the 185,
000 smitten things were, but the result was to
cause Sena^'h-Ereb to withdraw to Nineveh,
and the Jewish writer of three or four cen
turies after could safely pun on the name of the monarch, as Sena'^hem in Egyptian and
Ereb in Hebrew mean "locust" or "grasshopper."* Herodotus (2:141) speaks of
* Field of Sena^hem-u is in the northern part of the future world of the Egyptians. For Ereb see Ex. 10:12,
etc. The grass-hopper was sacred to Apollo.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 87
Senacherib, and says he advanced to Pelusium
at the frontier of Egypt, but that the night be
fore the fortress was to be assaulted numerous field-mice gnawed the quivers and bow-strings
and shield-thongs of the Assyrians, whereupon
they retired, suffering severe loss; and Hero
dotus saw the statue of the Egyptian royal
victor Seth-os in the temple of Pata'^h, and in one hand was the figure of a mouse.* The
Hebrew account is not reconcilable with the
many subsequent conquests Sena'^h-Ereb rec
ords on his cylender, but seems borrowed from
Herodotus, who says the god appeared to Seth
os in a vision, saying assistants would be sent
to him. The Greek assimilation of ''Heru and
Apollo enables me to point out that the Jewish
writer drew upon this deliverance by mice for
the account (i Sam. 5:6, &c.) of the deliver
ance of the Aron from the Peleshet-im, where
the Septuagint reads (v. 6) ''And heavy a hand
Jehoah to the Ashdod-im, and destroyed or I-Shem them, and smote them in Aapol-im;
* The mouse was connected with ^Heru or "Horus,"'
who as victor over Seth was also the Greek war-god Ar-es, but usually their Apollo. There are bronze figures of the mouse yet found in Eg^^pt, all inscribed with the words "<=Heru dwelling in '^Hem" or "darkness," perhaps ^^Hemi "destroyer" is referred to ; and with this let us compare "Apel-ah darkness" (Ex. 10:22) though Apel-ah is also rendered "darkness."



88 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
and in the midst of the land mice were brought
forth, and there was a great and deadly de
struction in the city" ; and also the Septuagint
version (6:i) "An the Aron of Jehoah was in
the field of the Philistines seven months, and
their land swarmed with mice." The Hebrew version says (5:9) Aapol-i or ''tumors" caused
a great "discomfiture" or Ma-Hum-ah,* that
is, "fright from noise," and says the Apoca
lypse (Rev. 9:9) that when Abad-on or Apoly
on led forth his locusts from the Abyss the
noise of their wings was Hke that of warchariots. The grass-hopper was sacred to Apollo, whose name is supposed to come from the Greek word Apollymi or "the destroyer" and so the plague of the Areb-ah was tha.t of
the Abad-ah or "destroyer" (Ex. 10:7), which was followed by the plague of darkness Apel
ah (10:22). The afflicted Philistines restored
the Aron, sending with it an A-Shem (comp.
"destroyed," i Sam. 5:6), consisting of gold Aapol-i and gold "mice" or Aa-Chaber-i, from which it must seem the Aapol-i were not mice
* Whence Me-Hum-an the first of the seven spirits or
genii (Esth. 1:10), called also Haman the A-Gag-i. In
1 Sam. 5 :9 is added, as if by a later redactor, "And I-Sather she to them Aapoli-im," but I-Sather is never rendered "breakforth," though once Sather is "destroyed" (Ezra 5:12), for the reference is to Esther, who says "me Abed-ath" or "destroyer" (Esth. 4:16).



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 89
unless the writer did not understand the legend, but were probably images of the grass-hopper,
the most destructive of all insects, to whom the
ravages of Sena'^hereb may have been compared. But the purpose in sending these sym
bols with the Aron of the God of Israel is not
clear unless Jehoah and ''Heru- Apollo are con
sidered the same. 18. Howbeit, it must appear from these
miraculous stories that, if so much priestly de
vice is applied to as late a time as that of
''Hezet-Jahu, little or nothing beyond his period
is entitled to consideration as history. The
main purpose of the narrative is to assert the good that rewarded one monarch who did right
in the eyes of Jehoah and to set forth what ill
befel the ruler who did evil in the sight of
Jehoah. The Chronicler will not even allow
to the older narrative the long and peaceful
reign of Manashah, because, finding him de
scribed as heretical, he is consigned to cap
tivity at Babylon (2 Chron. 33:11, &c.), with
subsequent repentance and restoration.
19. My conclusion is that a narration
written purely in the interests of the priesthood
of Jehoah, several centuries after the deportation of the Samaritans by Shalemanezer (2 K.
17:41), about B. C. 720, can scarcely be reck



90 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
oned with as historical for more than the names of the "Kings," while such a mythical person as Shelom-eh seems aponymous of JeruShalem, as also David of the City of David,
of which Gibbors or giants I speak more fully
further on.
20. The fact seems to be that the Jehud
im or ''Jews" were not at first a political body,
but a religious sect. The doctrine of Bed or
Badel, ''to separate" (Ezra 9:1; 10:8, 11, 16;
Nehe. 9:2; 10:28) from the people of the land,
indicates that these were Bed-ou-ins, which word Bedaa in Arabic means one who lives in the desert; hence the word Bed or Badel in
Hebrew means "separate," "alone"; and so
Abad or Abad-on, as personifying these "de
stroyers" or "perishing," became King of the
Areb-ah or "locust" (Rev. 9:11); wherefore, "when they had heard the law" (of the ^zeraa-ites) "they ia-Bedil from Israel all the
Aereb" (Nehe. 13:3); and this separation included the new-made law of the Decalogue,
Lo te-Neap, "not adulterate," which is later than ^eraa or Ne^'hemiah or they would have
cited it, as also Ne^'hemiah would have cited the
Chaldean custom of the seventh day, that day
of Sulem or "rest," but it is apparent that the
story of the law-giving had either not been



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 91
written or was not known to him ; and that Lo te-Neap is that they should not adulterate their
race by ''nup-tials/' the Latin Nuptialis, heath
en marriage, is to me quite clear (Ezra 9:2, 12,
&c.). It is this policy of separation, instituted
after the Makkabean war perhaps, yet maybe
earlier by the priesthood, though not as early
as the time of ^zerae, that gave the Jews to
secular and religious history as a peculiar peo
ple. And so, as Christianity went back from
an empty sepulchre to make a Christ, Judaism went back from a haughty precept to form a
religion and a history.



SECTION III
1 The great obligation claimed of . the Jews by Jehoah was that he brought them out of ''Egypt" or Mi-Zera-im. This name means
"from enemies," among other things; ''Tyre"
being Zor. The Egyptians called their country ^'Hem or ^Hem. The hot and dry month of
Summer, June-July, was in Egypt called Mesore, while in Hebrew and Syrian it was called Taru-Uz, but the Arabs call it Shaurval, which is probably both the Hebrew King Sha
Aul and the place Sheol; but as the Assyrian and Babylonian month Duz we find it the name
of the husband of Ishtar for whom she made
her descent into Hades. Zer or Azer or Mi
Zer is also "affliction," "shut-up"; hence the
word applies to any evil condition. The 4600
people carried off by the Chaldeans (Jere. 52:
28-30), in B. C. 600-586, and who constituted
the exploited "Captivity," might as well be re
ferred to as in Mi-Zera-im or "afflictions" as
those who fled to Egypt.
2. The most certain denial of an enslavement in and subsequent escape from Egypt



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 93
is found in the failure of ''prophets" to refer
to such an event when they sum up the ini
quities of that land (Jere. 46:14-28; Isaiah
19:1-25; Joel 3:19; Nahum 3:8-10; Ezek. 30:

7,2 : ) ; the three chapters of the Ezekiel be
ing wholly devoted to its sins ; hence it seems to
me certain that these writings are older than
the story of the Exodus, yet are all subsequent
to the Chaldean conquest. Surely the fierce JeRem-Jah would have done so in his wrath over
the migration to Egypt, but he is silent as to any such events. The name of Msheh himself
is not mentioned in any of their diatribes, nor
are Jeho-Shuaa or Aharon or other heroes of the occasion. The Decalogue and the awful
Sinai were unknown to these writers. Indeed, no animosity is shown toward Egypt, but on
the contrary that people are placed in their law
on the most favorable footing (Deut. 23:3-4,
7-8).
3. The story of the Exodus was probably written in part during the Babylonian
Captivity, and by the partisans of Je-Rem-Jah
while in Egypt. These are the ostensibly his
toric portions, and based on the familiar story
of a descent into and a return of the solar
hero from Sheol, for of this Egyptian liturgies
were full. Ae-Zer-aa or ''Ezra'' returned in



94 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
B. C. 456, or an hundred and thirty years after Jerushalem was destroyed by the Chaldeans, and Ne^'hem-Jah some years later; and they or the hierarchy which succeeded must have in
corporated into the secular narrative most of
the Thor-ah, which it is said that Ae-Zer-aa brought with him. The body of Jews which
went with Jo-'^hanan into Egypt, taking with
them Je-Rem-Jah, probably remained there,
withstanding even the allurements of the pic
tured land of milk and honey-wine. But,
whether from one place or another, sufficient
people of the sect of Jehoahs or "J^ws" re
turned to Je-Bus or Kir-David-ah* to estab
lish a shrine under that name of Deity, and
to call the town Jerush-Alom or ''possession
forever."
4. Abundant materials had been supplied
by the "prophets'' to make a systematic story
of the past. The Isaiah (19:20) had even given name to those who were to deliver from
Egypt the oppressed Bene Isera-El. At the
cry of their oppression Jehoah would "send a Moshi-Aa and a Rab and the Zilam." The
Aa-Rab Rab or "mixed multitude'' (Ex. 12:
38), literally "much darkness" or shadow, is
* So called on the Meshaastone.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 95
the same as Zilam or ''shadow/' and the writer
of the Exodus merely uses his own idiom for that of the poet, whose Oriental fancy doubtless meant some good geni, as will be explained
herein. From the poet's Moshi-Aa the Exodus could have derived the name Msheh and that of Je-Hoshu-Aa, both of them possibly forms of the name Jesh-Aa-Jahu or "Isaiah," as the latter certainly is. This Moshi-Aa or Hoshi
Aa is again mentioned in the later Isaiah (6;^:
8, 9), where (v. 9) ''in all their Zer-ath not a
Zer" is spoken of, and he is there called "the
angel before him"; and if the reference to Msheh (v. 11 &c.) which follows be a part of
the original prayer, continued into the next
chapter, it must seem that some story of bringing up Msh-eh his Aam "from the sea" (6^: 11) must have been known before the Jehoah
temple was built in B. C. 516 (64:11) ; and the "in all their Zer-ath not a Zer" (63:9) may
have assisted to expand and locate the legend of the Exodus. The words "from the sea," with no reference to Mi-Zera-im, supply sup
port to my opinion. All students are familiar
with the Chaldean myth of Ea or Hoa, another aspect of whom was Nebo, who came
from the sea, and was the author of letters
and the founder of intellectual pursuits ; more



96 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
familiar is the Greek aspect Kadem-os, who
was said to have come from Phoenicia, and in Hebrew his name means both ''eastern" and
''old" or "ancient"; while fully as clear is the
story of Ta4iut or "Thoth" in Egypt, the wise
god or angel, who also came from the sea, and who was at the Judgment "lord of the Ma^ha" or "balance," and which word Ma^ha is al
most precisely in Egyptian the Msh-eh of the
Hebrew, for ^H and S^ are interchangeable in
the Egyptian. This is the only mention of
Msheh in the Isaiah, and is probably the earli
est notice of him in Hebrew literature, for the
mention of him in the Jeremiah (15:1) may be from the Isaiah passage, though both the
alleged authors were in Egypt (Isaiah 20:3);
yet the Isaiah is usually led by the Jeremiah.
And so the sojourn in Egypt described in the
Jeremiah is all that the Isaiah refers to unless
we allow the text of 63 : 1 1 . The King of As
syria of 20:4 is not the Sargon of v. i, but
the Nebuchad-nezzar of the Jeremiah (43 noli, &c.) who had mastered Assyria (r) since there is no other apparent explanation of it.
5. In the Hosea (11 :i) we have notable
and contemporaneous expressions, it seems,
as the Jeremiah and the Isaiah, and v. 5 cer
tainly appears to refer to the land of Mi-Zera



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 97
im. Verse i says ''for Isra-El a child, his beloved, and from Egypt we called to my son"; but verse 5 says he would not return to Egypt, and Asshur would be his King; which condition is precisely what the prophet Je-Rem-Jah
had urged. Yet v. 7 says ''though he calls them up no one will Je-Rom them,'' which
seems a witticism at the expense of the fierce
Je-Rem-Jah, probably then in Egypt. From
the Jeremiah one may see how detestable JeRem-Jah had made himself to those who migrated. His vengeance came when he and his
sect or faction prepared the story of the Exodus, in which he as Aa-Me-Ram or "MostHigh" became the father of Msh-eh.
6. The Isaiah is a book evidently by sev
eral authors, and as late in parts as Ba-Aal
Piphi-oth or "teeth" (Isaiah 41:15), that is,
Antiochus Epiphanes, the "threshing instru
ment" in the days of the Makkabees, B. C.
165. In parts the Isaiah seems to follow the
lead of the Jeremiah in its dissent from the
Jewish migration to Egypt. The famous pas
sage (19:20) I have noted above. In this the
word Rab or "great," "many," finds its re
flection, as we have seen, in the Aa-Rab Rab
that went up with the fugitives (Ex. 12:38).
The Zil-am or "deliver-them" is the "shadow



98 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
them" which is equivalent to Aa-Rab or "even
ing/' the "mixed" of the Exodus; but it per
haps refers to the ^Haibit or "shadow" of the Egyptian anthropology, and which was a
variety of the soul; which perhaps as loChebed was mother of Msheh. In Egyptian
story the Sun embraces his ^Haibit to beget
"light" or the god Shu, possibly M-Sheh; with which must be compared the Rua^'h of Elohim which Ma-Ra'^he Peth or "rubbed an opening"
upon the front of the waters (Gen. 1:2), for
Rua^'h and ^Haibit seem the same. The word Rab or "great-one" can be connected with the
father of Mosheh, Aa-Meram or "greatHigh," if we use Aa or Ai as it means in
Chaldaic and Egyptian and Hebrew. We would thus have Mosheh and his divine par
ents suggested. The Luke (1:35) seizes these
points, and gives to Jesus the same parents as
are given to Mosheh.
7. But it is notable that Je-Rem-Jah is
also named "highest," as the word Ram or Rem means "high"; and he was known to Jehoah before being A-Zer or "shut-up" in the
belly, and before "coming forth" or te-Zea from the Re^'hem or "womb" he was Kadesh
ith or "^'sanctified," and given as a Nebie to the
Goi-im or "Gentiles" ; to which the "highest of



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 99
Jsh" replied that he was a child and knew not to speak; so Nebie Msheh was Chabed of speech
(Jere. 1:5-9). Extensive authority was then given to Jerem-Jah, and among others ''to the Abid and to Haros," rendered "to destroy and to overthrow," &c. (v. 10). such are the testimonies concerning him which his grand
nephew and his scribes must have borne, since
the historic parts at least of the Jeremiah seem
to have been written after the Gal-ah or "cap
tivity'' (Jere. 25:11; 29:10, &c.). 8. TEztrsit, as a native of Chaldea, and
perhaps author of the main portions of the
Hebrew Bible, makes of Jerem-Jah a partisan of the Chaldeans as against the Egyptians,
which was the unfortunate course of "Josiah"
or Joshi-Jahu, and of a minority of the people.
It was perhaps this preference for Chaldea that rendered the work of /Ezerae so abortive in
secular results. It seems that most of the
Judeans had fled from the rule of the Chaldeans
into Egypt, as we are told in the Jeremiah
(also, 2 K. 25:23-26), and the authors of the
Jeremiah show, in chapters 41-46, the earnest
yet futile efforts of the high prophet to prevent this movement; but in these arguments against it he says no word whatever of any former sojourn in Egypt, nor any word of a



100 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
migration thence; infallible evidence as this
silence is of the fact that these chapters are
older than the story of the Exodus, and that
that narrative was invented to prevent the de
parture or to accelerate the return of the fugi
tives, for no argument he could have made to
the Judeans would have been half so potent in
the mouth of Je-Remjah to restrain their
flight under lo-'^Hanan and others as the re
minder of former slavery there, had this ever
occurred. The Isaiah, a later book, often as
it mentions Egypt, and also hostile to that
country, speaks no reproach for any former
sojourn there. The very few sentences as to
the bringing up out of Egypt contained in the
Jeremiah are referable to later hands.
9. It seems incredible that Jerem-Jah,
declared to be a cotemporary and perhaps
witness of the destruction of Jerushalem by
the Chaldeans, should be their active and
zealous partisan, and the Ezra-ites must have
exaggerated his words and conduct; but re
ligious frenzy operating on his ferocious pas
sions (Jere. 18:20-23) may have been the cause. The Egyptian religion had perhaps
largely prevailed over any other at Jerushalem
a fact that seems denied when in the Ezra (5:



EGYPT AND ISRAEL loi
12) it is said "d. house this of Sathar-ah,"*
which words are referred in our version to the
temple at Jerushalem; but the reference is to
''Babylon of Chaldea," described as "a house
this of Sethar-alV' or I-Shetar, and which is the Hebrew name E-Sethar or "Esther," called also Hadas-ah; for Nebuchadnezzer in an in
scription declares he has ''made the way of Nana/' which was her usual name at Baby
lon.
10. The reform of Josiah was directed against the Egyptian cultus, it must appear,
when we find that he alters the religious ideals
of his father Amon, that his mother was daughter of 'Har-Uz or "Hor-us,"t while a particular aversion is shown for Tophet, which
in Egyptian was the secret place of Osiris, and for Beth-El where lerebo-Aam had long before
established the Apis bull as the symbol of
Deity. It was even claimed that Josiah was the
subject of prophecy some centuries before (i
K. 13:2), and that he would abolish the Egyp
tian rites and symbols, for the feast of lereba
* To render Sathar-ah "destroyed" is a solitary departure from the meaning of the word often used, meaning "veiled," "concealed," "hid." tCompare Joel's (4:14) valley of the ^Haruz, where
Hamon-im or "multitudes" are to be judged, doubtless the
Haman of the Pur-ius ; and ^Har-uz is here seen to be (v. 12) a translation of Jeho-Sephat or "Jehovah the Judge."



I02 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Aam was in the eighth month, which was the
month ''Hoak in Egypt, which was replete with
the solemnities of Osiris. The attack of Josiah
on Pharaoh Necho at Megiddo was more prob
ably instigated by religious fanaticism than
by political policy; and this view is supported
as well by his previous intolerance as by his
subsquent canonization by the Jahvists. This
sect probably now took its rise, led, it must
seem, by Jerem-Jah, whose daughter Josiah
married. Howbeit, the death as well as the
defeat of Josiah made of him a saint when they were connected with his persecution of other
sects, and he was apotheosized (2 K. 23:25;
2 Chron. 35:24-25). His words when wounded fatally are told
by the later Chronicler (35:23), ''Ha-Aabira
uni, for me wounded sorely," literally "the
Pass-over of me,'' or "mine the Pass-over," are
curiously connected with the Pa-sa% observ
ance (2 K. 23 :2i-23), which probably originat
ed as a national ceremony from the occasion of
his death, for it is also to be noted that Phar
aoh, who is probably Ne^het or "strong" in
Egyptian is called the "lame" in the Syriac and
Arabic versions, which may be explained by the
words Nechah and Pa-Sa'h (2 Sam. 4:4), both



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 103
rendered "lame," applied to Mephi-Besh-eth,
or "Memphis-shame:" while the father of Josi
ah's mother le-Did-ah or David-ah was Aad
lah, and Aad also means "to pass-over," so that
it is easy to see how le-Petha'^h was son of Gile
Aad, for Peta'h was the lame Vulcan of Mem
phis; and, in any case, "Josiah" or I-oshu-Jahu
seems to mark a departure or separation from
an old cultus to a new one, which latter finally won. "The mourning of Ha-Dad Rimm-on in
the valley of Megiddon" (Zech. 12:11) refers
to the defeat and death of Josiah, but it seems
less probable that Ha-Dad Rim-on is Josiah
than that it is a name of Je-Rem-Jah (2 Chron.
35:25), since the double m in Rimmon is only
the usual duplicate in Hebrew words, and Je
Did-ah the daughter of Je-Rem-Jah is a form
of ha-Dad; nor is it necessary to say that
Raman-u in Euphratic religion was an aspect
of Merodach and mate of Ishetar. The origin
of Pass-over is accredited to the flight from
Egypt, which was conducted by Mosh-eh, and Mosh means "withdraw," "draw-out," and so I-Oshi-Jahu may be the same name, as any Hebraist would readily admit The 12th Exodus
implies that the observance bore a martial hue,
though based on the popular conceit of a de



I04 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
scent of a soul or a hero into Hades and a suc
cessful resurrection or return.
11. The Egyptian party proved stronger
than Jerem-Jah. They protested that when they served Malech-eth Shema-im, rendered ''Queen of Heaven/' they had abundance, and
suffered no evil, for that they did as their an
cestors had done (Jere. 44:18); though they recognized Jehoah the god of Jerem-Jah (42: 2-3) as worthy of deference. The prophet
tells them that Jehoah repents of the evil he
has done them (v. 10), and orders their return,
and that if they disobey the command to go back to Judea none of them shall go back save those who have escaped (44:14), and so none save Je-Hoshu-Aa did return, and Chaleb the
Kain-i (Num. 14:30). The fugitives are said to have mainly gone to a place which receives
from the writer the name Ta^'hepa-Ne'^hes, re
verse of Sa-^'Hen-Pa'^hat or "Sister-of-theLion-Queen," evidently "Bu-Bastes" or ''house
of Bas-t," as she was called Pe'^hat by the
Egyptians, and yet Ta-'^Hapi-Ne'^has is "DarkLand-of-the-Nile."
12. The Isaiah devotes its chapters 30 and
31 to more elegant remonstrances against the
migration, calling Egypt itself Ra'^hab, met
athetic of Bera'^h or "fugitive," and explaining
perhaps the Hebrew name for it as "land of



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 105
Zar-ah" (30:6), and assuring the fugitives
that Jehoah will Pa-Sea'^h Jerushalem and its
escaped ones (31:5; compare ia-Aabor in v.
9) ; Pa-Sa'^h never being used in this ordinary
verbal sense; and so in 33:23 Pa-Sa'^h-im is
rendered ''the lame," preceded (v. 21) by the
statement that Jerushalem shall be "3, place of
Jeor-im (Jeor or ''Nile") Ra^'hab-i, which no
ship shall ia-Aaber-ani," and this seems a ref
erence in derision of the purchase of her peace
by Egypt from the Scyth-ians or Sak-3e
(Herod. 1:104-106), the "goat-like" people*
in V. 19, who destroyed Assyria in the reign
of Josiah, but who "passed-over" Jerushalem;
a fact sufficient to have originated the Pass
over (comp. 2 K. 23:21-23), or to have lent
historic interest to the old Spring festival ; but
"Pa-Sa4i-in they Bazez Baz" (Isaiah 33:23),
rendered "the lame took the prey," probably refers to the Aabera-im or "Hebrews" as
plundering the Bez-like Sak-se, making PaSa^'h-im the name by which the Egyptians
knew the Aabera-im, or perhaps their secret
name; and in any case, the Exodus (12:
36) follows by having as part of the history of
* No-Aaz evidently should be Cho-Aaz or "goat-like," or hairy, bearded.



io6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Pa-Sa'h that the Aabera-im spoiled Mi-Zera
im. 13. Allegorizing the supposed sojourn of
these fugitives in Egypt, it is alleged that la
Aakob and his family went thither; lakeb in
Egyptian meaning "weeper," and this fits in with the weeping of Ra'^hel at Ram-ah, of
which the Jeremiah (31:15) had spoken, for in Egyptian the word Remi also means "weep
ing," and it is therefore represented that it is
her sons that are first taken to Mi-Zera-im;
described (30:7) as "the time of the Zar-ah of la-Aakob," who is also made to lament the
fate of these sons as thus foretold (Gen. 37:
35; 43:14). Each was an old divine concept of Chanaan; Ra^'hel in Arabic meaning to
"stray" like a sheep, and the tribal father I
Sera-El probably altered to suit the Egyptian
word. Even the mighty David of the laterwritten history is promised or predicted for
the fugitives (Jere. 30:9) when Jehoah shall save them out of Mi-Zera-im. There is a promise (44:28) that a remnant shall escape ^'Horeb, and return, which does not accord
with the prosperous glimpse of them we have
in perhaps an interpolation of the Isaiah (19:
17-18), but the cry La-'^Haz or "oppression"
(v. 20; Ex. 3:9) is to come by reason of their



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 107
''task-masters" or Ne-Gesh-i, which Ne-Gesh by metathesis becomes Gosh-en, but seems the
Negas or "King'' of the Ethiopic, and perhaps Goshen means land of the King. Egypt is to be frightfully punished, says, not only the
Jeremiah and the Isaiah, but the Ezekiel, yet
not for aught done against the Israelites, and
perhaps for sheltering those who fled from the
Chaldeans, as Nebu-Chadnezzar is to depopu
late it for forty years (Ezek. 29:11), and the
plagues invoked by Mosheh doubtless represent
these prophecies.
14. The 600,000 men, besides women and
children and many cattle, escaped by night, at
the prayer of the inhabitants. The picture of
their oppression was thus far too feeble for the
fierce followers of Jerem-Jah and ^zerae. The
punishment of the deserters was insufficient.
They must go into the Ma-Debar for that forty
years the Ezekiel had said Egypt should be
depopulated, for this Ma-Debar or "from
Speaking" was a process of purgation or atone
ment, which the forty days of Jesus in the MaDebar and the two years of Paul in Arabia
represent, and is a species of living-death upon
which religious mysteries are yet built.
15. The Aareb Rab or ''mixed multi



io8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
tude"* that went-up with Bene-Israel (Ex.
12:28) is the Rab of the Isaiah (19:20), ren
dered "great-one," also the Aareb of the Jere
miah (25:20-24) and the Ezekiel (30:5); but Aareb Rab can mean ''desert chief," "dark
chief," the Greek word Ereb-os, as in Hebrew Aareb means "evening," in Ethiopic the Sun
set; hence we may be certain the words do not
mean "mingled multitude," but some protect
ing power. The town the fugitives first left was Raa-Meses, which in Egyptian means the "Sun-of-Evening" ; and they first reached Such-oth, which means in Hebrew a "thicket,"
a "covering," and in Greek Sek-ot means "dark," though the Mystic-os Sek-os or "mys
tic cell" in the Eleusinian Mysteries of DeMeter will here be remembered; while in He
brew the word Sebach is the "thicket" that caught A-Besh-alom, and caught the ram that
was substituted for I-Za'^hak, and the Shebaz
that seized Sha-Aul (2 Sam. 1:9), for in
Egypt Sebek is the crocodile-god, son of Nit
or Neith, particular aspect of Deity at Nubti or Ombos, and at Shed-at or Ar-Sin-oe; and
Shed-at means "concealed" in Egyptian, as
does the hieroglyph crocodile, also "to spy,"
* The Aseph-Suph of Num. 11:4 may be rendered the "carried-off."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 109
"destruction" ; and the crocodile was called Em
Sa^^h, the Souch-os of Strabo (17:1:38); the terror-goddess Ta-Ur or Shep-ut often wear
ing the figure of a crocodile. Sebek was also solar, and Sebek-Raa seems the Sun of the abyss or Under-world. The connection of Such-oth with the hidden realm is also dem
onstrated by the feast of ''tabernacles" in au
tumn when the Sun is departing, and thus con
nects with the Sek-et barge wherein the ''Sun
of-Evening," Raa-Meses, entered the invisible
land; and this boat is also called Sekar and
""Hen-nu; so that in assimilating Jerem-Jah to
Osir-is (Jere. 37:15) it is said the princes smote him and ''gave him his Aoth a house of
the Asur of house of Jonathan, for they made it a house to Chel-a"; Aoth meaning "sign,"
and (v. 16) "for he came to the house of the
Bor and to the ""Hannu-ioth" or "cabins"; all
which clearly refers to the funeral Bar-is and
''Hennu barge. After this Jeremiah was taken to the ""Hezer of the Ma-Tar-ah, rendered
"house of the guard," and subsequently sent in cords to the Bor of Malach-Jahu, where was no water, only Tit or "mire," &c. ; but this is here probably a contemptuous use of the word.
16. Now, at Such-oth, the consecration of



1 10 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the first-born was declared to be an Aoth or
"sign" on the hand and a Tot-Poth or ''front
let/' Greek "phylaktery'' (Ex. 13:16), which
latter is said to be the band wound above the
eyes upon which was written sentences from the Tor-ah, and worn at prayers ; but in Egyptian Tut or Dut was a ''handmaid" in the
sacred rites, and one of these with a band
about her head stood at the front of the
"cabin" on the barge of the dead, and a
similarly attired one at the other end, called
the great Ter-et and the little Ter-et (comp. "house of the Ma-Ter-ah" or "guard" of Jeremiah), while Tat-et or Tad-et was a con
spicuous name of the goddess at "Busiris" or the "house of Asar-is" of Tatu or Daddu, and
closely connected with functions for the dead; besides which the Tat or Dad or symbol of
Asar-is, and the Ta (a knot or tie of some
sort) or amulet of Isis were placed in doubles
alternately on the Bar-is; hence this Tut-u or Tot-Peth or Tit or Ter-et or Ma-Tar-ab may
all be considered in the Greek word PhylakTer or "guard," "watcher," which seems to connect with the famous Palakid-es of AmenRaa at Thebes, the Egyptian Kerem-et-u, whence perhaps the Hebrew word ^'Herem or
"devoted," the English "harem," "hermit," for



EGYPT AND ISRAEL iii
there were holy women shut-up to the god, and who watched or were watched; hence Zachar or "memorial" was a "male" sign and the TotPeth or "frontlet" was a female sign (Ex.
13 :9,i6), like the Dat and the Ta (comp. Peth
ah, Isaiah 3:17), as on the Egyptian "boat"
or Baris of the dead; so that this account of
Jerem-Jah implies that he went into and re
turned from the Bor or "pit" (Baris) of the
dead, or the ""Hennu barge of the Sun, and the
former bore phallic emblems, doubtless respected by Hebrews as well as by Egyptians
and Greeks.
17. It was after they left Such-oth that
the Bene-Israel "encamped" or ia-^'Han in AeTham, and Tem in Egyptian is the Sun-set god. It is now that the two Aam-Ud-i or
"pillars" appear, and Jehoah in them to Ne^'h
oth or "lead" them the way, usually "com
fort," "rest," "repent," but the Egyptian of
Ne'^h is "to entreat." Then the fugitives en
camped before Pi ha-'^Hir-oth or "Mouth of
the Caves," between Mi-Gedol or "greatwater" and the sea; before Ba-Aal Zephon, &c. ; Zephon or the "North," with which the
Jeremiah (6:22; 10:22, &c. ; Isaiah 41:25) so often threatens the Egyptian faction; and so the child Mosheh was Zephan (Ex. 2:2) ; and



112 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Ba-Aal Zephon is here an apparent protector
or avenger as in the Jeremiah, which plainly
refers to Chaldea (3:18, &c.) in these threats;
while scholars agree that Zephon is the Greek Typhon, a name by which they refer to the
evil Deity, the foe Set of the Egyptians.
Pharaoh, however, is made to say of Bene
Israel, ''they are weepers in the land, Sagar upon them the Made-Bar" (Ex. 14:3), as if they were lost souls who could not pass over,
while Sager and the Sekar or ''shut-up" barge
of the Egyptians are the same. To save from
the Ma-Zera-im the guide angel and the front
Aam-Ud got in the rear, but the sea had to be
cloven before the passage could be effected, and this was done "in the wind of Kadin Aaz
ah," which as "east strong wind" recalls the Seair-ah or "whirlwind" of the vanishing Eli
Jahu, Jonah's Seair or "tempest," especially as
Kadim Aaz-ah means "ancient she-goat" ; so that we have here the oryx-barge which symbolised Seair or "tempest" ; while the pursuing
horses and chariots are the same as at the as
cension of Eli-Jahu, who had also to pass-over
in ''Horeb-ah, rendered "dry land," while "in ''Horeb-ah" and "in la-Bash-ah" (Ex. 14:21,
22) are both used at the Red Sea. So, w4ien David fled it was first to Ba-^Hur-im or "in



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 113
the Caves/' the same as Pi the ''Hir-oth, but
was advised to lodge that night in the Aaber
oth of the Madebar, and also Aabor ''te-Aabor"
(2 Sam. 16:5; 17:16), which probably means
that he should pass-over in the ''barges" of the
Madebar, and also had permission to passover ; hence he went to Ma-^'Hena-im-ah, which is a feminine form of ''Hennu or Ma-^'Hen-nu*
the divine barge of the Sun, the "cabins" of Jeremiah; and David came back in the Aaberah (19:18), which seems the same. And so
Ja-Aakob arose from ''Haur-an or ''caves," and, pursued by Laban, reached Ma-^'Hena-im
in safety, for Gale-Aad, where he left his pur
suer, also means in Hebrew the "great-pass
over"; yet a further account says that in Ma
''Han-eh (Gen. 32:22) and during the night
he Aaber all his family and goods, and when
alone on the la-Bok he le-Bek or "wrestled"
with a man, which is nearly the same word as
the I-Bek-aa or "cloven" waters of the sea
(Ex. 14:21); but when Ja-Aakob arrives at Such-oth it is ^s-Av who has gone "to his
way of Seair-ah," while in the cases of Eli-Jahu
* Ma^hen was an Egyptian word for a large serpent, and, as David and Ja-Aakob and the house of Sha-Aul all fled to
Ma^hena-im, it may seem that this word corresponds with Pa-Ran or "the Ran-u" serpent-angel of the Egyptians, and refuge of David and Ha-Dad and I-Shem-aa-El.



1 14 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
and Jonah it is the Seair-ah, rendered "wirl
wind" and "tempest," which causes them to dis
appear, the one into Heaven, the other into the
recesses of the Seph-in-ah, and then into lom or
"sea''; and if Seph-in-ah is "Spain" or Aaber
ia ("Iberia"), as the "hidden" or Saph-un
(Deut. 33:19; not "preserved," v. 21), we may have the "Red Sea" or lom Suph and the Aaber
or "pass-over" of it as the figurative passage to Amenti or the "West," the "hidden" world; for Such-oth and Zaphon and Saph or Saphin,* &c., evidence the hidden and mysterious.
18. The ^Hom-ah or "wall" of the water
on each hand when the passage was made is the Egyptian for "wife" or "woman," and
seems to serve in place of Aamm-Ud or "pil
lar," and respond to the Aamm-od or "stood"
at the Aaber of Jordan (Josh. 3:16) and to
the "ceased" or Aamm-od when Jonah (1:5)
was cast into the sea; though ''Hom-ah also
means "shut-up" in Egyptian ; and so Ja-Aakob
had two wives at his famous Aaber (Gen. 32:
23), for Isis and Nepthys, or some aspect of
them like the Ter-et women or the Kerem-et of
Amen-Raa, always guarded the bier; and so
*The Egyptian name Zaphen-ath Pa-Anea^h, perhaps "bread of life," given Jo-Seph, probably refers to the Zef or Zeph, "divine food," of the Egyptians,



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 115
this ""Hom-ah on each side at the lom Suph
may be referred even in Hebrew to ''Ham or "father-in-law" and ''Ham-oth or "mother-inlaw," as Judah to Tamar and Naa-Am-i to
Ruth. 19. They were now in the Ma-Debar or "from-speech" ; perhaps the Egyptian MedeBar or "new-speech." The Hebrew meaning seems better, as "silence" was not observed, and the persistent "murmuring" or Lun seems
to have been the cause of their curse. Lun,
however, is often rendered "to tarry," "to
lodge," "to abide"; hence Elon is rendered
"tree" as a shade. But in Chaldaic Ilan-i is
the plural "gods," and it is possible that the
transition had rendered these people "divine"
in their own conceit, or rather it was necessary
to the allegory, since they received celestial
food and miraculous waters, and could quarrel with Jehoah. The Egyptian idea was that the unforgiven in the Shades ate dust, thus creat
ing thirst, but the blessed hoped for and per
haps received cakes and ale, and the gods
ate Zepha-u. The Hosea (13:5) calls the Madebar "the land of Tal-Aub-eth," perhaps "roving-demon," but the spirits who refreshed David at Ma-^'Hana-im-ah said (2 Sam. 17:29) "the people are hungry and weary and thirsty



ii6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
in the Madebar," for there Shobi seems the
U-Sheb-ti or servant of the deceased as the
Egyptians called the figure they placed in the
grave with the dead; Machir is of Lo Debar
or ''no speech," Bar-Zill-ai means ''prison-of
the-departed/' while Chimeham or the ''pallid"
seems a word for Egypt supplied by the Jere
miah (41:17), perhaps its plural or Chem-ah
im."^
20. Bene-Israel met no friends in the MaDebar save le-Thero the "law," who was of Alidi-an, which may mean that he was Med-ah
or "tall," a giant. The first fight was at RephId-im with Aamal-Ek, and Reph-Id-im means "giant-hands," and Aamal is "sorrowful
toiler," hence the same as la-Bez or Zeb-ai (i
Chron. 4:9-10) or Bes, and of course of the
family of ^sav as the word Ek or Eko is
Arabic for "goat," which implies the Satyr aspect of the super-human,t and with ^sav and Aamal-Ek and A-Gag and Haman the Agag-i we have the more usual names of the
supplanted Deity of the land, with whom was
* The story of David's "pass-over" or Aaber into and return from the Ma-Debar or Hades, in fact the entire story of the revolt of A-Besh-Alom or the "shameful youth," is shrewdly left out by the later Chronicler. t Another explanation of the name Aamelek is herein
given, as Aam is "people" and Aalek is rendered "horseleech ;" hence "blood-sucker people."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 117
war with Jehoah "from generation to genera
tion'' (Ex. 17:16); yet this concept was al
ways a giant in size or strength as his bed as Aogat Rab-ah, or his high gallows as Haman,
or his skull as Gol-Iath or Gol-Gotha, &c., seem to testify, while as Shimesh-on, Sha-Aul, Bo
Aaz, and perhaps Je-Petha'^h, and others, he
was the militant aspect of good. The Egyptian Dua-t or night-world of the Sun and of the
soul was frequented by forms of Aa-Pep or "giant,'' who had many shapes and more numerous names, and he was the foe of Raa; while as Set or Sute^h (Zadok), Ba-Aal or "Baal," &c., he was the foe of the man
god Asar or "Osiris" and the Osiri-ised or "blessed" ; and the word Set in Egyptian means
"mountain," "desert," and the jackal-looking
beast Sha which symbolised Set or violence
also was the demonstrative of the name "Baal"
in Egypt, for this Canaanite god had at least
one temple in the Delta, and was considered by
the Egyptians as a war-god.
21. This victory over Aamal-Ek was near
Sin-Ai. Maafek* was the name of the penin
* Ma-Afek may have given name to Aphek near Sidon,
where stood a famous shrine of Aphrodite, that is, Hathor, and the Aphek where the Philistines encamped before they
took the Aron from the sons of ^1-i, and before they killed Sha-Aul, for Hathor was the Sun-set goddess.



1 18 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
sular we call Sin-Ai, and in the quarries there
the Egyptians made their criminals and captives toil. The great mother was the fem
inine of Deity there under the famous name "Hathor" or ^Het-^Hor; and Ta-Sen or "the sister," a name of the great mother, may give
us Sin-Ai or ''great sister," as the word means
in Egyptian. Ta-Ur-et or ''the mighty" was that fierce phase of Isis-Hathor which is presented with a sow or hippopotamus or croco
dile head, and I think she was the goddess
Thuro or Tha-Ur-o of the Phoenicians, rendered "law" ; hence le-Thero came with Zippor
ah the wife of Mosheh to the ""Han-ah or "camp" at the mountain of the Elohim (Ex. 18:5), called "Horeb-ah (3:1), which "Horeb means in Hebrew a "knife" or "sword" as well as "dry-ground," and Ta-Ur-et is often pic
tured with a "knife" or "sword;" in the Egyptian tongue Dema (or Tema) and Mades; and Sin-Ai and ''Horeb-ah are considered identical.
So, after the visit of le-Thero, there began the
delivery of the Thor-ah or "law," "written in the Ae-Ziba-Aa of Elohim" (31 :i8; comp. 34:
27-28). This delivery was attended with
scenic terrors, unlike those intimated by Apu
leius when initiated into the Mysteries of Isis,
yet alike a theophany, but scarcely equal to the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 119
parallel experience of Eli-Jahu at "the mountain of the Elohim of ^Horeb" (i K. 19:8, &c.) ;
and this other fugitive murderer was also fed with angel food which strengthened him the usual forty days. It seems consistent that
^Horeb should mean ''dry/' and still more
"sword," when associated with the bloody ante
cedent in both the cases of Mosheh and EliJahu, but when it is remembered as the place
where these fugitives and the fugitive Bene
Israel took sanctuary we may reverse the letters of the word and read 'Horeb as Bero'^h or
"fugitive,'' as Jonah a "Beroa'h for Tarsh
ish" (i :3). And so '^Hes-ah and Aoz or Ma
^Hes-ah and Ma- Aoz (Joel 4:16), "refuge"
and "stronghold," both "fugitive" or "to flee,"
seem names of ^Hes or As, "Isis," for "deci
sion" or 'Haruz, that is "Horus," is just spoken
of (v. 14), and Egypt just after (v. 19) ; and
the protecting mother is to be supplanted by
Jehoah, which tends to show that 'Horeb-ah, as
Bero'h is a name that also refers to the "great
sister" or Sin-Ai of Osiris.
22. At the supposed time of this flight
the Egyptians were certainly occupying the
Sinai peninsular, they have many inscriptions
there, and of course had temples ; nor is it un



120 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
reasonable to suppose the criminals who worked
there in the quarries had a right of sanctuary
in these temples, or in some one dedicated to
the goddess in her aspect of Ta-Ur or Sheput, as compare Shepot or "judge" (Joel 4:12),* and as at Kadesh or Ain Mi-Shepat. The Egyptians seem to recognize Bes and Set as the mate of Ta-Ur-t, and in them we surely have Malech Aar-eth or the "skin king," per
haps here represented by le-Thero, called also
Reau-El, and son of the hairy ^sav. How
beit, at Sin-ai or ^'Horeb-ah, "Mosheh went up
to the God, and called to him" (Ex. 19:3), which indicates that this mountain was noted
for its particular Deity, and that its rocky
grandeur typified him, as it did Set or "moun
tain."
2^,. This Deity was adopted by Bene Is
rael; and Mosheh built an altar below the mountain, and sent youths and offered them
up for Aol-oth,t and oxen for a peace offer
*The Arabs call Sin-ai Mountain of the Tur or "law." Is it a mere imitation that in his He-Gir-a or "the flight"
from Mekka to Medina Mo^hammed hides himself for three days in a cave of Mount Thur? In Hebrew Ha-Gar is rather "the immigrant" than "fugitive," "flight;" comp. "in the Ger-uth" of Chimee-v-Ham (Jere. 41:17). In Ba-^Hur-im or "in Caves" David was stoned by Shem-Aei ben-Gera, the same as I-Shem-Ae-El son of Ha-Gar who mocked at IZa^hak. Pa-Sa'^h in Egyptian means "the flight," "the runner." fAol means a suckling child, but I-Petha^h's Aol-oth (Judges 11:31) was not.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 121
ing; and he sprinkled half the blood on the
altar, and half on the people from the basins,
as pleasing to the war God they were making
a contract with; and that the Na-Aare-i or "young-men" were Aol-oth or sacred sacri
fices (Ex. 24:5), and not officiating priests,
is clear. Such bloody rite was appeasing to
Jehoah, as when Noa^'h offered the like (Gen.
8:20-21), so he showed himself to the chiefs
and seventy elders, probably the supposed sev
enty of the Septuagint, and they saw Jehoah
eat and drink (Ex. 24:11). He had under
his feet ''like a work of the tile of the Sephir"
or ''book," that is, the Sepher of Covenant (v. 7), written on a Leban-ath or "white tile," and
like the Aezem or "body" of the Heaven for
clearness (v. 10) ; and he then told Mosheh to come up and he would give him the Lu^'h
oth of the stone and the Tor-ah and the com
mandment, "which me written to those of the Hor-oth" or "the mountaineers" (v. 12) or
Hor-ites ; and this Lu'^h-oth, rendered "tablets"
from their La'^h or "shining" surface, are the
Leban-ath or "whitish-tile" of the book or
scribe. That he had written these for the
Hor-oth (usually feminine plural) may connect with A-Har-on and his death at "Mount"
''Hor; but the Syrians did speak of the god of



122 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Iserael as god of the Har-im (i K. 20:23). At the first meeting of Mosheh with Deity at
''Horeb-ah he had called himself Ehieh, sounding as the Egyptian Au-a or ''I am," and the words are demonstrated by the human figure in Egyptian; but the name he usually gives
himself is lehoah, probably in Egyptian luUaa or the ''Coming-One/' It can not well
be gainsaid, however, that the name and local
ity ''Horeb, whether as "sword" or "drouth,"
or as reverse of Bero^'h or "fugitive," bore some
significance in this story of these fugitives.



SECTION IV
I. From the standpoint of religious mys
ticism, then common in Egypt and Greece, the
Aabera-im were now initiates; the thunder,
the Hghtning, the smoke, the Chebed or
"glory," the blare of the trumpet, the voice
out of the thick cloud, the earthquake, and
lehoah descending on the mountain in fire,
being followed by the lectures or statutes to
be observed. The subsequent trials of forty
years, attended still by thirst, by famine, and
by strife with ogres and giants, are used to
Nes or "prove," "tempt," the novitiate, whose constant I-Lun-i or "murmurings" suggest
local "deities," or the Ilan-i, as the Chaldeans
called the "gods." A "shrine" or Mish-Chan and a "coffin" or Aron were made after the
scene at Sin-ai, and borne with them as the cell of the Deity whom they wished to keep among
them. This statement may explain the mean
ing of the word ""Hor-eb, as the ''Her-'^Heb of
the Egyptians was the "face-festival," when the image was brought out of the shrine and borne
in procession; hence a sort of theo-phany for



124 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the people, as was the case at ''Hor-eb, as thus
told, and with Eli-Jahu at the same place.* This view seems confirmed by the arrival of Bene Israel at Kadesh B-Aren-Aa or the "holy in-the-great-Aron" or "ark," also called
(Num. 13:26) Pa-Ran Kadesh or "the vessel sacred" if we allow the Egyptian word Aaren,
the Latin Urna or "urn," which Apuleius (11)
says was carried in the procession of Isis, over
lain by an "asp" or Aaraa; but this "ineffable
symbol" was preceded by a chest containing
the sacred utensils, he says, which probably
represented the Mish-Chan, which in the temple became the Kadesh Kadesh-ah or "holy of
holies," the classic Adytos or Adytum, which sounds like the Aron of the Aad-uth (Ex.
25:22). 2. This Kadesh is also called Ain Mi
Shep-at (Gen. 14:7), which in Hebrew is "Eye
of the Judge"; but Shepu-t is a name of the goddess Ta-Ur, with whom we may identify
Miriam, as she died there, and who is probably
the same as Naa-Am-i or Mara of Beth Le'^h
*Un ^Her ^Heb or "show face festival" seems the same as the Aaber or "procession" of Merodach of the Babylonian
records. The Aabera-im or "Hebrews" were perhaps those
who on such occasions bore the sacred "boat" or Aaber-ah, which seems the shrine of the Smi-god. (See Apuleius. Isaiah 46: 7).



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 125
em, but who must reasonably be identified with the Moon-goddess Kadesh of the Egyptian in
scriptions, to them a foreigner, and also called Ken-at, perhaps from the Hebrew word Chun, as she holds in one hand the perforated "cake"
or Chun (Jere. 44:19), a generative symbol,
whence the Latin word Cunn-us or ''secret,''
and so the votaries of lehoah changed Kadesh
from "holy" to Kadesh and Kadesh-ah, ren
dered "sodomite" and "harlot;""^ but she was
the great Nature-Mother, known to the Israel
ites as Ta-Mar the Kadesh-ah or "harlot" who
seduced Jehudah, the Aash-Tor-eth whom
Shelomeh "went after," the De-Lil-ah and
Ruth who ensnared Shimesh-on and Bo-Aaz,
the Ma-She'hith of the Mount Olives, and the
Epherath-ah or Aphrodite of the Judean hills
and Greece, &c. ; in fact Ta-Mar or Miri-am
means "beloved" in Egyptian, and was a name
especially applied to SeMiet of Memphis, whose
name means the "powerful."
3. Thus the arrival at Kadesh or Mi-Shep
hat seems in the allegoric Exodus a place of
* The earlier Egyptian drawings of her, says Budge, present Kadesh nude, but the later ones with "tights," with the head-dress of Hathor, and standing on a lion between
the Eg>^ptian god Min or ^Hem and the Arab god Reshepu of the gazelle frontlet of Set, thus demonstrating that she was both Egyptian and foreign.



126 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
protection and judgment, and responds to the
Ta'^hap-One'h-Es of the Jeremiah (43:7 &c.),
by reverse Se-''Hena-Pa''hat or ^'Daughter-o£
the-Cat-queen" ; ''Hen-at meaning "queen" ; and
this connection is shown (i K. 11: 17-20)
when a solar fugitive goes to Pa-Ran and to
Ta'hap-Enes the Geber-ah, that is, Sene-Pa^hat
or "Sister of the Cat"-goddess or hon-god
dess;* and so A-Besh-alom's corpse "was cast
in the forest to the great Pe'^hath,'' for a den of
Hons perhaps is figurative of the "Pit" ; often
She^'h-ath and Sheoland and Bor; but She^h
ath is the hon-goddess wife of Pata^'h of Mem
phis, and the Ta'hash skins, rendered "seal"
skins, over the Aron and Misha-Chan seem a
mere reverse of this name of the lion-goddess,
who was, like Ta-Ur or Shepu-t, a destructive
aspect of Hathor. The two seem to meet in the
case put by the Jeremiah (43:10) who says
Nebu-Chadnezzer will extend over the stones
at Ta'hap-Ane'h-Es his Shepe-Rir, for Rer or
Rer-et is a frequent name of Shepu-t or Ta
Ur-t. The word Sheol, often rendered ''pit,"
* Pe^h-et was the Speos Artemidos of the Greeks, and in upper-Eg}^pt. The goddess was called for the town or the
town for her. She was called "Neb-t of Sep-id" or "lady of the star Sirius," thus an aspect of Isis, and of the fecund inundation.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 127
may be reverse of Laish or "lion," and so the
King Shaaul. In Egyptian myth the hon was solar; under the name Akel the lion guarded
each opening of the tunnel which at night the
Sun passed through ; and the ''Henek or "fun
eral-couch'' has the head and feet and tail of
the "lion" ; its name Man, feminine Man-t, thus
perhaps connecting with the word Mit or
"dead," the Hebrew Muth;* but a "cat" is also Man and Man-t.
4. Now, when the Bene-Israel had finished
the Mish-Chan and put the Aron in it, they
set out, "and i-Shechan the cloud in the Madebar of Pa-Aren" (Num. 10:12), but in v. 33
it is the Aron that goes before them to Thur or "seek-out" to them Ma-Nu'^h-ah. And when the Aron set forward Mosheh would say "rise-up lehoah," and in the Nu'^h-ah he said
"Shub-ah lehoah," &c. The real nature of the Aron seems here revealed, however, when
(11 :i) it is said "the people were like Mith
Aonan-im, Raa in the ears of lehoah," for
which he Ba-Aer-ah them in fire, for Aon is the Sun (Gen. 41:45), and Mith-Aon would
* Achitho-phel is said (2 Sam. 17:23) to have "ia-^Hanak and ia— Math," or, as we say, took to his bed or death-bed,
and died; not Tal-eh or "hanged." The name of f=Henoch,
who "walked the god" (Gen. 5: 22-24), and his son MethuShela^h or "death sent-away" seem to connect with the ^Henek.



128 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
be the "dead-Sun/' as the Annu or "HeHopoHs" of Egypt attests, though Aon-an may here imply a ''mourner" for it; and when we
turn to the historic prelude of the Jeremiah
(43:13) we readily find that Beth Shemesh in
Egypt, that is, Aon, is to be Sarap in fire while
the fugitive Judeans are there, just as they were burnt as Mith-Aonan-im if Ba-Aer-ah
and the Sir-ap mean ''burn," for they seem Egyptian words. Now we have the story of
Aon-an (Gen. 38:9), who "Shi'^h-eth the earth
not to give seed to his brother," whose name was Aer, and whose wife Ta-Mar bears a name of Egypt as "land of the Inundation," and
which as "the beloved" was a name of Se^'het
the lion-goddess; and this story seems a solar
myth applied to the ideas of the Isaiah (19:

20:), for it is Jehudah that gives twins or
prosperity to Ta-Mar though thereby put to
Buz or "shame" ; and these twins perhaps orig
inate in the Isaiah (20:5) as "Gush their Ma
Bet and Ma-Zera-im their Pa-Areth," since Ma-Bet is "corpse" in Ethiopic and Pa-Areth is "the man" in Egyptian ; the twin Zera^'h, in
deed, being king of Ethiopia (2 Chron. 14:18). When he comes in to Ta-Mar, the "Sun" or Aon-an "destroys" or She^'hith the ground not
to give seed; and that this is the meaning will



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 129
be seen in the different version of this same
story, called Ruth (1:1), when there was a
Ra-Aab or ''famine" in the days of Shepat of
the Shephat-im; Raa-ab being reverse of BaAar or ''burnt" (Num. 11 :i) when the people were as Mith-Aon-im; for both Ta-Mar and Ruth are Chel-eth, rendered "daughter-in
law," and Naa-Ami is Mar or "bitter," the Buz or "shamed" Je-Hud-ah is Bo-Aaz, ChiliOn the husband of Ruth is Aon-an the husband of Ta-Mar, hence Mith-Aon or "mourner" for the "dead-Sun" who invoked the BaAar or Raa-ab which A-Chel or "devoured."
Thus the word Chel in some of its forms is the
key of these three stories; Naa-Ami telling Ruth not to make herself known to Bo-Aaz
till he Chel-eth to A-Chel or "endeth to eat,"
and after he had lain down in the extremity of
the "cave,""^' and she had Gal-eth (Gal-ah
means "captivity") his feet, &c., she is told he
would not rest till he had Chel-ah the Debar
(3:3, 18). That Jehudah, and Bo-Aaz in less
degree as derived from the former, represent
* "Heap-of-corn" is rendered from Aarem-ah, but this usually means "naked," and the correct word is evidently Me-Aar-ah or "cave," which accords with Jehudah's friend ^Hir-ah or "the cave" the Aadullam-i, and with Noa^h "naked" or Aereveth and the same as the drunken Lot in his Me-Aerah or "cave."



130 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the stupid Israelites seduced by the attractions
of Egypt, as also la-Aakob, seems to me clear
from certain texts of the Jeremiah (30:10-11;
46:14-17, 27-28, &c.), which opened the door
to the story-teller, who applied the old local
and popular mythology in the Jahvist days
after the migration to Egypt for fear of tfie
Chaldeans. ''They cried there Tharaoh king
of Egypt is Aon; the Aabur of the refuge,' ''
or "refuge of the Hebrew," as well as Aon, and
with perhaps the Greek meaning of ^on or
''eternal'' ; and this replies to an appeal (46:16)
that they return to their Aam-an, and to the
land of their birth from before the ""Horeb or
"sword" of the Jon-ah or "dove," emblem of
Assyria; whereupon lehoah utters threats for
their obduracy, against Egypt, No-Ph, or "city
of Phata^^h," Amon Me-No or "Thebes," &c.
Nebu-Chadnezzar is to come, and the ""Horeb
will A-Chel-ah or "devour" (v. 14), but Israel
will be by lehoah "saved" or Mosh-aa from
afar, and his seed from the land of Shib-Iam
or "old-day" or ancient time, thus suggesting
as also in v. 26 a former occupancy. "And la-Aakob return and rest and be Anan;" nor
shall he fear, though lehoah will Chel-ah all
the nations to which he has driven him; but



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 131
not make a Chel-ah of Israel, yet I-Ser-eth or
"binding" him to Ma-Shepat, '&c.
5. Another writer (44:27) declares that
all the Judeans in Egypt shall be consumed
by ''Horeb and Raa-ab till Chil-oth them, and
this seems to apply to the time of ''Hophe-Raa
or the ''serpent-Sun," while the other applies
to the time of his predecessor (by twenty
years) Necho or the "strong" (44:30; 46:2).
It is difficult to translate the word Chel under
these different uses, but in the sense of "closed
up" as in widowhood we may understand that
"daughter-in-law" is not correct, while it would
answer to "ended," "finished"; and so, Ta-Mar
and Ruth being aspects of the great Mother,
their Aonan or Chil-Ion evidently connect with
Shimesh-On as these women with his wife Th
Oan-ah or "occasion" (Judges 14:4) whom he sought from the Philistines at Timen-ath
ah, the Egyptian Ta-Man-u or "Sun-set,"
called also De-Lil-ah. So, with these indices we may understand the Mith-Aon-im (Num.
II :i) who appear as soon as the z\r-On or
Aren. But that these "mourners" should
cause "burning" or "famine" when the Aron
had been given by Jehoah might create sur
prise if it were not that this symbol of the



132 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
presence of Jehoah in their midst should have
had an opposite effect.
6. The incident that follows is that of
their Te-Avv Ta-Av-ah, or ''fell a-lusting" as it is rendered. In Egyptian the word Af means "flesh," and Tae had the meaning
''room" or "house" in both tongues; hence "house of Flesh." But Af has in Egyptian
the religious meaning of the corpse of the Sun
the Sim after passing into the Un-seen World.
The Af there travels in the Seket-et boat of the afternoon, and we have him as Af-Raa, Af-Tem, Af-Asar, and Asar is called Sem-Af or "form-of-Af." ^s-Av or "Esau" is perhaps Aash-Af or "much-flesh" in Egyptian,
and so was a giant as well as the Sun-set god.
Le-vi the priest tribe may be "no-flesh," as
priests were often prohibited from eating
flesh.
7. The legend of the Man or "manna" as found in the Exodus (16:13 &c.) was prob
ably suggested by the Jeremiah (46:16) ; comp.
48:28). Sword of the Jon-ah shows that "oppressor" and "dove" are the same word. In Egyptian the "ring-dove" is called Man,
the common "dove" is called Sulu-t and the "raven" is Sul-u, while in Hebrew "raven" is
Aarab and so is "evening." We read that "in



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 133
the Aarab went up the Sel-Av. and covered
the camp''; Sal-Av, rendered ''quails," being
in the singular. The later book Numbers,
which elaborates this story, also speaks of
Sal-Av-im, and has it that they were the flesh
that was promised; but that ''quaiF' is the cor
rect rendering has been much disputed. A
variant version, that of Eli-Jahu in his hiding, has it that he was fed by Aarab-im or "ravens," and this account may have confused the writer of the Exodus. The use of SalAv, and the substance Man as the result of
the presence of the Sel-Av, points to "dove"
as the correct rendering as tested by the Egyptian. But there was (Jere. 48:28) a kind of
Jon-ah that nestled in the holes of the Selaa
or "rock," and I suggest, in dissent from all
interpreters, that a starving people might eat
these ''Hir-i Jon-im or "cave doves" (2 K. 6:25). The Greek word for it is Cheiro-ptera
or "hand-wing"; it is Dak-ai in Egyptian; the
Aatal-Aph, perhaps "night-flyer," of the He
brew (Lev. 11:19), again mentioned (Isaiah
2 :2o) as living in holes of the Selaa or "rock."
So, after the Sel-Av had covered the camp, the next morning "went up the Hatal," and on the ground was "a Dak, a Mi-'^Hus-Pas, a Dak
like Chephor" or "pitch." Mi-^Hus-Pas is



134 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
rendered ''round-thing" without the sHghtest
authority, whereas Ma-'^Hus or ""Hes is ''to
flee," a "refuge," implying a covering, and
Pas is an "end" or "extremity," hence a
"hand," and so the Chetoneth Pass-im of
Joseph was a long cloak that covered his feet
and hands, as the wings connect with the feet
of the bat. Dak or "small" being "bat" in
Egyptian supports this opinion. Chephor,
however, rendered "frost," is also a "cover
ing," but as "atonement," "expiation," is the
word used for the "lid" of the famous "mercy
seat" or ark, which may have been black like
"pitch." This food was not the promised rain
of bread (v. 4) save in a satirical sense; but if
we take it as the excretions of bats, so fre
quent in caves, we are to bear in mind ( i ) that
it was a penalty or expiation, like the dust the
wicked in Hades were supposed to eat (comp.
Gen. 3:14; Isaiah 65:25); (2) that the book
of Numbers (14:26:35) puts the penalty of
death on the whole adult body of these millions
for murmuring, and (11:31-34) even sends a very great plague on them for eating theSel
Av-im; (3) that the allegory of the Exodus
is based on that of a descent into Hell, (4)
adapted by the prophet Je-Rem-Jah and others
to the migration of the Jews of their time to



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 135
Egypt. In the Babylonian epic of the Descent
of Ishtar she found Hell a place of darkness,
the inhabitants clothed like Nebuchadnezzar in
feathers, and with mud and dust as diet. The Egyptian prayers beg that in the Duat they
shall eat no filth. The Jeremiah (42:13-22;
44:12-14, &c.) had told the fugitives they would all be consumed in Egypt, and should
not return; hence the Man w^as necessarily a
distasteful food. The deposit of a fragment
of it in the Aaduth or ''testimony,'' that is,
probably, the ''ark," though that vessel had
not yet been made, might seem evidence that
it was to be taken as the reminder of punish
ment, and at least it was not the food of a
living or natural person. Indeed the word
Man might connect with Ha-Man, the archenemy, the Agag-i, for the Aug-ath or "cake"
of Eli-Jahu (i K. 19:6) is of the Aog or Gog
series of words.
8. Whether or not the Man or "manna" can be connected with the "body" or "flesh,"
the Af of the Egyptian, confused in the Exodus
with the Sal-Av, eaten as a memorial of the
dead Christ, remains to be suggested. Paul
(i Cor. II '.26) explains the Eucharist as "pro
claiming the Lord's death till he comes." The
Egyptian writings speak of the bread of eter



136 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
nity, and they placed viands within the shrines
or ''arks'' of their deities, as the Man was
placed by the Hebrews in their "ark"; which facts tend to show that Bene-Isra-El in the Ma-Debar and subsisting on such food was
conceived of as in a super-natural condition. The Aron or "ark'' was clearly symbolic of
the dwelling of Deity; his coffin or boat; and
the food placed in it attested that he was yet
alive or would return to life. To eat it as his
Af or "body," as Paul understood Jesus to
teach, was to declare faith in the immortality
of the man-god; that he was dead or absent, but would return. The Roman Church goes
so far as to say that the blessed food is actually
the body and blood of Jesus; but the Man or
Sal-Av of Bene-Israel, originally perhaps two words for the same thing, was sent down from Heaven "to tempt them walking in my law"
(Ex. 16:4) ; that is, to ascertain if they could
subsist on such loathsome food and be stead
fast till they came to their earthly Paradise.
It is possible that the word A-Man or "faith
ful," "true," is alluded to by the word Man,
and it might seem that the Latin word Salv-us,
"to ^ve," and so "Saviour," connects with the Salav that went up. Apart from this, it would
seem from the more elaborate and hence later



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 137
account of the Numbers, where the Salav is
separately eaten, that when Mosheh asked for
food Jehoah tells him to fetch seventy old men
and officers over them before him, as if these
were to be Sal-Av-im or the flesh to be eaten,
for it is easily urged from the story of the famished ^s-Av that the "red" or Adam he ate was an Adam or "man" ; but, in any case,
the seventy or seventy-two old men are the same in number as the seventy-two conspira
tors who put Osiris in his chest. 9. Another concept may be advanced on
this subject. Bene-Israel left Egypt in that Aezem day of the Mez-oth (Ex. 12:17), and the Aezem-oth of lo-Seph (13:19) were carried-off with them. Dying in Mi-Zera-im,
they I-^'Hen-et him, and put him in the Aron,
and his burial at Shechem indicates that he
was Ba-Aal Berith (Judges 9:4, 46). The ^'Hen-et is evidently the ""Hennu barge, and the
Aron also indicates his solar divinity. Sep
or Seph means to "take-away," "carry-off," and the feast of A-Seph was that of Such-oth
(Ex. 13:21), w^hen the Sun is going to his
tabernacle after fructifying Earth, and doubt
less in a Sephin-ah or "ship" of the sleeping
Jonah on his way to Hi-Sepan-ia. In Egyp
tian the Sun as Sept or Sepd was the "pro



138 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
vision" of Deity, while Zefa was the food of
the gods. The story says lo-Seph was in
Egypt called Zephan-ath Panea'^h, hence after
Such-oth the Bene-Israel go to E-Thom or the
''end" in Egyptian, but then to Ba-Aal Zephon, that is, the ''hid" or "North" Ba-Aal. Aezem
is plainly not "bone" but rather "body" of lo
Seph, embalmed or in the ""Hennu barge ; hence corresponds with Av and Af-Berith or "covenant" is supposed to be derived from the
eating or cutting of bread together ; Bar mean
ing "grain," &c., Bera meaning to "cut,"
"shape." When Bene Isera-El makes the
Berith with the Elohim (Ex. 24:) we have the precedent for the Last Supper; for the
elders or nobles are present and they see God
eat and drink (v. 11); as the disciples were
present when the body and blood of the divine
one was eaten as a new Berith; and the God had something under his feet like the Aezem of Heaven, &c., rendered "body" ; but it seems,
from his not laying his hands on the nobles,
and from the statements otherwise, that the
children (v. 5) and their blood were the
diet that sanctified the Berith. The Aaber or "pass-over" to Molech was perhaps a "Hebrew" he was supposed to eat, and Molech was
Bosheth or Ba-Aal (Jere. 3:24; 19:5, &c.).



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 139
10. It is likely that the Aezem of lo-Seph,
that is, his body in his aspect Sept, the vic
tualler or harvest-god, was symbolically eaten,
his blood was likewise drank, for Sept or Sepd
is the star Sirius which brought the fertilizing
"inundation," the Hebrew Sephia^'h (Job. 14: 19), which made food, and in which star dwelt
Isis, who was called both Sept-et and Zefa.
It will be noted that the Man was given in the month Ziv (Ex. 16:1), April-May, which
means ''brightness,'' as the Zefa food (Budge
says) seems some celestial food made of
"light," from Zef-zef "to shed light," while Zef was the eye of Raa and of Horus. The A-Seph Suph (Num. 11 14), perhaps suggested by the Jeremiah (8:13) and Zephaniah (1:2),
as "I will consume," is evidently not "mixed
multitude," but the thing wanted for Te-Av by the Mith-On-im or "murmurers," that is, mourners for the "dead-Sun" (v. i) ; and the Aerab Rab that went up (Ex. 12:38) seems also from the Jeremiah (25:20, 24) and the Isaiah (19:20), but the connection is not clear; yet A-Seph Suph and the Aezem of Jo-Seph are to be noted. When his brothers saw JoSeph approaching they called him Ba-Aal ^Helom-oth or the "god of dreams," and con
spired to kill him and cast his body into one



140 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
of the Bor-oth, which, as near Shechem (Gen.
37:12), perhaps refers to the name Ba-Aal Ber-ith; and they agreed further to say that
he had been eaten by an evil beast; and so all
that he does in Egypt, from his succeeding the
baker and the butler, his prediction of famine
and fertility, his accumulation of grain, to his
fetching his family to nourish them (Gen. 46:
II, 18, 20), all tends to show that he must be
identified with the divine concepts just men
tioned, as also that the feast of Aseph (Ex. 23 :i6) or Such-oth, the Greek 0-Socha-phoria,
was part of his cultus; while the ark of the
Berith (Josh. 3:3, &c.) was probably the ark or barge which contained his Aezem-oth as it
contained the Manna, for this latter was given
in answer to the Te-Av or "lusting" of the Asaiph-Seph, we are told in the later book (Num. 11:4); nor is it improbable that the
miraculous food was considered the flesh or
"body," the Aezem, of the god who gave the
produce of Earth. II. But "in the Aareb, in the Aareb-oth
of Jeri^'ho, they ate from the Aabur of the land, after the Pass-over, unleavened-bread and
Kelu-i, in the Aezem of that day, and the
Manna ceased after they had eaten of the
Aabur of the land" (Josh. 5:10-12). This is



Taur-t or Shepu-t or Ivcl-et of the Egyptian Inscriptions; perhaps De-Lil-ah, or Lil-ith, or Besh-eth, or Aash-Tor-eth.



142 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the single instance where Aabur is rendered "corn," though the word is among the most
usual in these books, for the difference of the
latter vowel amounts to nothing. Probably,
as in 2 Sam. 15:28, it should be Aareb, since
this would continue the play of words, and also account for the Aereb Rab that went up with them (Ex. 12:38), and who in turn was now eaten; corresponding with the A-Seph-Suph
(Num. 11:4), the Sal-Av that in the Aereb
went up (Ex. 16:13), the Aezem-oth or ''body" of Jo-Seph that was taken up, &c. Aereb as
Ereb-us to the classics, means ''west" in He
brew, and Arab-ia was "west" to Babylonians,
as Europe was doubtless to Phoenicians a word
for the "west"; hence as the Sun-set or "evening" the Sun-god had Aabur or "passed
over," and so we have Iber-ia or ha-Span-ia;
but in all this we have a juncture of the words Aereb and Aeber. For this "west" and "evening" the Egyptians said A-Men-ti and Man-u, and probably Man or "manna" is from one of
these words, so that it suggests the supper
hour, besides appearing in the night ; hence as
a meal at fixed festivals, in Autumn especially, such as Such-oth or A-Seph, we might look for the divine food to be eaten. But the Exo
dus, while begun in the Spring, seems certain



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 143
ly an allegory of a descent into Sheol, doubt
less understood by all who were familiar with
the Osirian mysteries, and by the early Chris
tian writers who tell us of the Last Supper of
Jesus, and celebrates rather the resurrection
of dead Nature than the departure of the Sun
which animates it; yet it must be borne in
memory that in Egypt the Spring is the season
of harvest, as the Baa'h or "inundation" oc
curs in early Autumn.
12. Incidents are added to the narrative in
order to illustrate features of the laws of
^zeraa and the Jahvist hierarchy. The inter
marriage with Mo-Ab and consequent worship
of the Ba-Aal of Pe-Aor was a particular per
version of the separation from other peoples
which ^zeraa sought to establish, as seen in
the book which bears his name; so the story
of Bile-Aam the son of Be-Aor is to serve the
purpose of consecrating Bene-Israel at the
hands of the "god of the Aam" or native ''peo
ples" as Bile-Aam thus means in Chaldaic, or
"worthless-people" in Hebrew. But the ''burn
ing" or Scrap serpents, the mountain ''Hor or
"cave," the place 'Horem-ah or "secluded" (to
Deity), and Aob-oth or "enemies" (Ezek.
39:27), Aren-On or "ork-of-On," the Amor-i



144 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
or "talkers/' Ma-Tan-ah or the "giver" (fern.),
Na'^hali-El or the "brooks" or "possessions
God," Bam-oth or "high-places," &c., end the
suggestive list by the arrival at the top of Pi
Seq-ah (Num. 21:); which accords with the
outline of the Isaiah (43:19, &c.), and termin
ates the silent-phase of the soul by the Egyptian
word Pi-Sagi or "the tongue," though contin
ued by an account of Si'h-On and the Amor-i
or "talkers" of Moab, readily suggested by the
48th of the Jeremiah, which the Numbers
(21 :28, &c.) freely quotes, but makes the town
Si^'h-On a person.
13. The book Deuteronomy ( 32 149 ; 34 : i
has it that, not Bene-Israel, but Mosheh went
to the top of Pi-Seg-ah, and speaks of Aai-i
Aabar-im (Num. 21 :ii) or "heaps of the He
brews" as a mountain, calling it Neb-o as sug
gested by the Jeremiah (48:1 ), as Nebie means
"prophet" in Hebrew and "lord" in Egyptian, while Nub-ti was a well-known name of Set;
but the Ezekiel (39:11) perhaps originated the
Gei or "valley" of the Aabera-im or "He
brews," and has it that Gog and all his Hamon
shall be buried there, which burial of giants
would of course make a "heap" or a mountain,
for Ha-Mon of Egypt (30:10; 31:2; 32:16,



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 145
18, 20, 26, 31, 32) seems Gog and his Meshech and Tubal (32:26) ; and hence in the Exodus story we come next (Num. 21:31-35) to Aog the giant whose bedstead was at Rab-ah because Rab-ah and Ezekiel's Hamon-ah mean
the same (Deut. 3:11-17; as also compare
Ezek. 39:18). The Exodus follows further
the Ezekiel in its later chapters, for the Ezekiel
divides the land for the twelve tribes, as in the
Joshua, thus showing that the account of the
deportation of the ten tribes more than a cen
tury before was unknown to Ezekiel or had
not occurred, and so impeaching the historic
narrative. The Ezekiel (45:21-25) orders
only two of the great religious observances,
that of Pa-Sa'^h and that of A-Seph or Such
oth, both alike, giving no motive for these Spring and Autumn customs, which in the subsequent Pentateuch are claimed for lehoah,
and wearily elaborated.
14. Thus it is my contention that the
prophetic books are the main source and in
spiration of the figurative Exodus ; and that the
motive was to restrain the fugitives or to fetch them back from the land of Zar-ah (Isaiah 30:6) when the Chaldeans destroyed the Egyptian supremacy and Jerushalem; when it was said (Sam. 1:3) of Judah ''she dwelleth among



146 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the nations; she finds no rest; all her perse
cutors overtook her within the Mi-Zera-im/'
The very miracles of the story attest its utterly
unhistoric standing, while the protests of the
Jeremiah and the Isaiah against the migration
thither will be seen to have laid the foundation
for a narrative beside which the human fancy
supplies no parallel.



SECTION V,
I. The name which in EngHsh is spelled "Moses/' the Greek form, has in Hebrew the three letters M-S^'-H. The vowel point between
the second and third letters gives us Msheh. The statement that Bath-Pharaoh named him Msheh for that she Mesh-ithih him, rendered
''drew-out/' from the water or Ma-im, is re
fused by Josephus. He refers the name to the Koptic words Mo and Ushe, ''water" and "saved." This is more probable both from the forms of the words, from the Boch-eh or
"wept" of the child, as well as that the princess
must be supposed to have spoken her own lan
guage rather than that of the despised He
brews. Mush in Hebrew means to "withdraw," and is the word relied on for "draw
out." The play on words, frequent in these
Bible narratives, possibly explains his name,
for it is said she called his Shem Msh-eh, the
reverse being he-Shem or "the Name" (Lev.
24:11), in which case the correct name is concealed. Cicero ("Nat. of Gods," 22) says one of the several Mercurv or Hermes was son of



148 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the Nile, and that the Egyptians deemed it criminal to pronounce his name, and by Mer
cury the scribe-angel Ta^'hut or ''Thoth" is
meant. 2. ''Thoth" seems the general model for
the story of Mosheh. In the judgment scenes
the ape or A-Aan, as a type of ''Thoth," sits on the "balance" or Ma^ha or Masha; hence we have perhaps Pa-Aan or ''the Ape" as the
classic Pan; and it is ''Thoth" who records the
guilt or absolution of the soul whose heart is weighed; but A-Nup or "A-Nub-is," whose name suggests Nebo and Nebie or "prophet,"
usually bears the title Utzaa or Uthaa or "weigher," though the functions of the two
angels are somewhat intermingled. Shekel is the usual Hebrew word for "weigh," and probably enters into the name of Ae-Sekul-Api-os or ^sculapius, father of Macha-on, and son of Koron-is or the "crowned," perhaps the "horned" Moon; and Mo'^hu in Egyptian is rendered "crowned." ^sculapius had temples at Gaza and Carthage, the town "Ascalon" or
A-Shekel-on was doubtless connected with his
cult, and probably also the vale of Asheck-ol where the A-Nub-im or "grapes" were grown. The Greeks recognized the divine scribe Taut of the Phoenicians as ^sculapius; and the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 149
Memphian son of Pata'h, le-em-^Hetep, was
also so identified, and called by them I-Mouthis,
but his name means ''Coming-in-Peace/' and he was perhaps worshipped at Jeru-Shalem as
Shelom-eh, called 'le-Did-Jah in the Aabur of
Jehoah^' (2 Sam. 12:25), ''beloved of lehoah in the divine-boaf' or Aaber-ah, in which case
Dad or ''David'' would be a phase of Pata^h,
that is, Bes or le-Bus, as said already; Shelom
meaning "peace'' and "to finish"; while the
Psalms entitled Ma-Sachil to David and to
Kora^h are in the sense of "wise" advice, per
haps, but may connect with .E-Sakel-Apios. Nebo, the angel of wisdom in Chaldea, is called ''son of the house of Saggil" or Sakkal, which
house of Saggil was the great pyramidal temple of Bel-Marduk at Babylon; and from Nebo we may have Nebie or "prophet," and Nob or Nob-ah the "city of priests" (i Sam. 22:19), while Nebo is a supposed mountain not found by searchers, which is so named doubtless for
Msheh; but, as this mountain is also called
Pi-Sag-ah, one may see the effort to connect him with both the Chaldean Nebo and the Egyptian "Thoth," who was Pi-Sag-ai or "the Scribe" of the Gods, in their tongue. "Thoth" or Ta^hut restored to life young Hor-us when
he was Pesa^h or "stung" to death, and this



150 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
perhaps means he restored ''light" when Zar
or "scorpion" quenched it, "possessing command great of Maa-^Her-u" or "true-Words," whence he was the Roman Mer-Cur-y, from whose name we have America; but he was in Egypt most usually called Pa-Hab or "the Messenger," and the Hab or "Ibis," which
came with the Baa'^h or "inundation," was his most usual symbol; wherefore perhaps the Greek Phoebus or Ph-Oeb, applied to Apollo.
But it was Joseph, saluted as Ab-Rech (Gen. 41:43) or "wise" (Re^h) "judge" (Ap) who may be meant for Thoth, who was called ApRe'^h-u or "judge of the combatants," Horus
and Set. Thoth is also called Te^h, perhaps
the original form of Ta^'h, and Te^h means
"weight," like the Hebrew Shekel. 3. The Egyptian word Mo^'hu or "crowned" is more probably the Hebrew word
Mesia'^h or "anointed." And it may be that Msheh is from the Hebrew word lesh or Jesh, implying "existence," and usually rendered
"is," "there was," and much the same as Haiah or "to be," whence is supposed the name Jehoah; and so (Num. 9:20, 21) lesh Asher Iheih or "there was that it was" the cloud a few days over the Mish-Chan, meaning "it was so that it was," but reminding us of the Ehieh



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 151
Asher Ehieh or "I am that I am" ; the Egyptian A-Au or ''me am." The two substantive verbs are probably from the Shemite and Egyptian languages respectively, and lesh passed
into the Latin as Esse, while it is probable that the Hebrew word for ''man," Aish, means "being," and that the Akkadian Ushu-Gallu
means "great-being" in place of its perversion
to "ogre." Howbeit, it must seem that, if lehoah is from Haiah, and Msheh is from
lesh, they mean the same in the original sig
nification of the two words. The name of Jes
us or les-us, we have pointed out herein, is
the Greek form of the name Ish-ai or "Jesse,"
and Ish-ai is evidently from this Hebrew word lesh or the Akkadian Ushu. M-Isheh or "Moses" is a change from lesh that is familiar
to Hebraists, as the first syllable M- often has
no significance to us ; so Mo-Shel or "ruler" is
the Shal-it or "ruler" (Daniel 5:29), Mo
'Hamed and ^Hamed, Me-Human and Haman, Me-Ram and Ram, and frequently ; so that M
Ish-eh the law-giver and Ish-ai or Jesus have the same name; meaning the still "existing" or "immortal," like the Omesha Spentas or "immortal saints" of the Persians, from whom
indeed it is possible that yEzera may have derived Mosheh's name.



152 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
4. The names of the parents of Jesus are made the same as those of Mosheh. The names of the parents of Mosheh are not at
first given, for it seems there was a desire to
identify him with the royal house. AaMeram, however, means the ''great" or "MostHigh," as Aa in Egyptian and Chaldean as
well as Hebrew (Isaiah 11 115) means ''great";
and in Hebrew the word Ram or Me-Ram means "high." It was probably designed only
in these stories of giants and genii to allude to the huge size of Aa-Meram. In Egyptian the name Aam-Ram would mean a Rom or "man" of the Aam-u, as Aam-u were the no
mads of the desert; the Hebrew Aam or "people," which term they applied almost ex
clusively to those of Israel. The mother,
Chebed or lo-Chebed, is rendered "hardened"
his heart, "slow" of speech, "honor" thy father,
&c., and it is the "glory" of Jehoah. These expressions show to me that Chebad is the Egyptian word ^Haibit, which was the shadow
or ghost, which, besides his soul and double
and spirit, each of the dead possessed, and this
shade of ghost could go about. It is depicted
as black ; hence Ai-Chebod was the son of Phi
Ne'^has or in Egyptian "the black," and of Lalath or "night" (rendered "near-to-be-deliv



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 153
ered'') who died in child-birth when the Aron
or ''ark" was captured, and after ^1-i had
fallen dead, old and Chebod or ''ghostly." The god Tern in Egypt begot the twins Shu and Tefnut, or "light" an "moisture," by union
with his ^Haibit. The Luke (1:32-35), more fully than the Matthew, seizes the meaning of Aa-Meram and lo-Chebed when Gabri-El or "mighty-god" tells Mary "the holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Most-High shall overshadow thee." This was also the story in
Egypt of Isis, who conceived ''Har-pa-^'Harad
or "Harpocrates" after the death of Osiris by
a ghostly cohabitation with his. That this shadow or daemon should have "hardened" Pharaoh, cause to be "slow" the tongue of Mosheh, and was the "honor" of the ancestors, accords with the Chebad or "glory" of Jehoah which Aaber or "passed-by" Mosheh, who had been promised that all the Tub or "beauty" should Aaber before him, but was not per
mitted to see the Chebad; so that this Chebad
seems to have gone before Jehoah, as his back was seen, and not to have been a part of his
"beauty" (Ex. 33:18-23); Mosheh himself being a Tob or "goodly child." So, a cloud
Chebed (19:16), and locusts, flies, hail,
murrain, &c. (8:20; 9:3, 18, 24; 10:14) ; show



154 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
ing that Chebad was something aggrieving or
afflicting, though in some of these passages the
word ''many" or "much" (Num. 20:20; Gen.
50:9, 10; Ex. 12:38) shows quite curiously that Chebad has the same meaning as Amon, Haman, Ma-Mon, that is, 'Xegion," or the
Hamon of Gog or Agag the geni-giant.
5. The floating island in Egypt, men
tioned by Herodotus, was called ^Hebt, but the Greeks called it Chem-is, which, as ^Hem was
the native name of Egypt, proves that this
island of ^Hebt, the birth-place of Horus, gave us the name E-Gypt; and so the ancient town Kopt-os, a form of the word Egypt, is yet called Khemim. This island was in the Papyrus-Swamps, and near the famous town and shrine Per-Uath, which Greeks called Buto;
and it was to it that Isis passed over to escape
Set, and to nurse and conceal Horus, or to have him nursed by Latona, who seems to be
Lel-at or Ta-Ur, the Hebrew Lil-ah or DeLil-ah; while Per Uath probably gave name to the Python as Uath or Uatz-t was eminently the asp-goddess, otherwise Ran-nu, whence
the Aron or ''ark" or cradle. But the isle
^Heb-et, though it seems to have given name
to Egypt, the Arab Kib-ti, and was close by
the great oracle of Buto (Herod. 2:155), and



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 155
was the birth-place of the divine son Horus,
usually identified with Apollo, born at Del-os
(Te-Lil-os?), yet there is naught to show from
Egyptian sources that it connects with the word
^Haib-it or ''shadow," ''ghost," but it gave
name to Isis as Neb-t ^Hebet or "lady of ^Hebet," which might give us lo-Chebed, and
thus refer to Mosheh as Horus. This, too,
might accord with the Zar or "scorpion" which Pese^'h or "stung" Horus, and with the word Mi-Zera-im or "Egypt" as a Zar or "enemy." To identify with Horus or Apollo might imply
that Mosheh meant the "archer," which in Egyptian is Masha. 6. Besides "Horus" or ""Heru, however,
we have the babe Sargon in his boat of reeds and bitumen on the Euphrates, Romulus as an
infant adrift on the Tiber, Bacchus and his
mother Semele shut up in the Bar-is or "chest" on the sea, &c. ; Bacchus being suggested by the infant Mosheh who Boch-ah or "wept" in his Teb-ah or boat; while Dion-Usi-os may seem Adon-Iesh, or words from the Hebrew that connect with M-Ush-eh and les-us. The story of Semele and Dionysus (Pausanias,
3:24), shut up by Kadmus in the Baris, gave
name to Bras-ise, a town on the south coast of
Greece, convenient to Egyptian and Phoenician



156 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
trade, and is important because this Bar-is is
the Aa-Ber or "pass-over" boat of the Sun and of the blessed dead from which the Aabera
im or ''Hebrews," as well as Iber-ia or "Spain" and the mythical Hyper-ion or Sun-set god, derive their names; so, Ber-oe was nurse of
Semele, since a cradle or womb and a nurse
are figuratively the same. The Teb-ah of Mosheh and the Teb-eth of Noa^'h mean in
Egyptian a "chest," "boat," or "coffin," and
the Aron or "ark" is also rendered "coffin" be
cause perhaps the serpent as the symbol of the goddess Ran-nu was depicted on the lid. The
allegoric Exodus of the Aabera-im in the
Made-Bar may mean, not "wilderness," but
"great-boat," from the words Med-oth, as in Ha-Medatha the "giant" father of Haman, and
Aa-ber or "ferry-boat" (Num. 13:32; 2 Sam. 19:18), though more probably Made-Bor or
"great-pit."
7. Preparatory to the narrative of the
birth of Mosheh, we have some account of the rapid birth-rate of the Aabera-im. "And the Bene-Israel they Par" (Ex. 1:7), &c. ; hence the word Pur-im, which in Egyptian means to "come-forth." The Egyptians afflicted them
by putting over them chiefs of Mes-im, that is
superintendents of "births" if we take the word



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 157
as Egyptian; so the Israel-i built cities Mis
Chen-oth to Pharaoh; probably not "store/'
but cities for "child-birth" ; similar to the Mish
Chan or "tabernacle" of the Israeli, where the
Deity reaewed himself. "Afflicted in their
Sabel-oth" can be rendered in their "childbearing." The Mis-Chen-oth cities were Pithom and Raa-Meses; and, while we may understand Per-Thom or "house-of-Tem" the Sun-set god, and Raa-Meses or "Sun-of-Evening" or of "Production," these selected names of the Sun that has passed over may be sug
gestive of Mosheh as the morning phase of it,
usually considered as Horus or ^Hepera, which latter probably appears as Cheppor or the slain young Sun mourned for in Autumn at "Yom Chippur," and whose symbol of the ^Hepher
or sacred beetle seems to typify re-birth or a
new life.
8. The 15th verse begins to speak of the
Aibera-im as if written by a different person, but perhaps Aiber was the Sun-set god. Their two mid-wives have appropriate names, Shiper-ah or "dawn" and Puaa-ah or "brightness"; but in Egyptian the S^ and ^H are so frequently interchanged that the former may be ^Hepher-ah ; while P-Uaa-ah may in Egyp
tian mean "the Uaa" or "the One," like Je



158 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Hoah or I-Uaa the ''coming One," but the God made to them Batt-im or "daughters," per
haps Tab-im or ''arks" or "sarcophagi," not Beith-im or "houses." That the two "mid
wives" or Me-Illad-oth were the famous angels of the birth-chamber and judgment scene, Mes^Hen-t and Renen-t, seems clear, though called
Hebrew mid-wives, for in the judgment scene,
which to the good was a birth into immortality,
the cradle or "ark" or "tabernacle," called the Mes-^Hen, is depicted above the head of Mes^Hen-t and Renen-t who stand behind the deceased while his heart is being weighed and his hand is held by Horus. However, in the birth-room scene of famous Queen ^'Hat
Shepes-t, Mes-^Hen-t presides while both Bes
and Ta-Ur are present, as they are at other
birth scenes, and a frequent name of Ta-Ur is
Shepu-t, which recalls the statement that
Miriam died at Ain Mi-Shep-at, and that it was she who guarded the infant Mosheh; for Mi-Shep-at was also called Kadesh-ah or "holy," otherwise Pa-Ran Kadesh-ah (Num. 13:26), and Me-Rib-ah; also Mas-ah (Ex. 177) as the Egyptian word for the "birth"
angel; but in the Numbers (20:1-13) the death of Miriam and the curse upon Mosheh imme
diately precede the reason for changing the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 159
name to Merib-ah, while another account (chap. 14) says the whole generation were
cursed and made Roaa-im (v. 33) or ''wicked'' or "herdsmen" for forty years because at the
report of their spies they wished to return to
Egypt.* It thus seems probable that Pa-Ran Kadesh
ah refers to the nurse-angel Renen-t or the
Ran-nu angel who guarded infants, either of whom may well have given name to the A-Ron
or "ark" or "cradle," which first attested its power when it departed not from the camp with the penitents at Pa-Ran Kadesh-ah, whereupon they were slain "till the 'Hor-Em-ah" (Num.
14:40-45) was probably appeased. And the mountain to which these victims went up was
evidently 'Hor, the Egyptian name of "Horns," to which mountain Bene-Israel went from Pa-Ran Kadesh-ah. At Har or "Mount" ^Hor
* They were even smitten and killed "till the cHorem-ah" (v. 45). This word is usually rendered "utterly-destroyed," "devoted," "shut-up," hence "harem;" but while the text implies a locality formerly called Zep-ath (Judges 1: 17), and so Mi-zep-ah the daughter of Je-Petha^h in Gile-Aad, it is probable that ^Hor-Em-ah means the name of the divinity of the place, as "Cave-Mother" or "White-Mother," or the
"Shut-Up" and invisible to whom human sacrifices were made. "Hathor" or cHet-^Hor was goddess especially of the
land of Sin or Sin-ai, and it was she who as Se^het destroyed the foes of Raa or the Sun-god. Miriam was "shut-up" or
Sager at ^Hazer-oth or the "enclosures" before Pa-Ran was
reached (Num. 12: 15). ^Her-Rem-i in Egyptian means one "weeping."



i6o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
died A-Har-on, whose name like the Egyptian
god Set must mean ''mountain/' implying giant
size. There the Iseral-i i-'^Har-em the Canaan
ites and their cities, and called the place of this
slaughter ''Hor-Em-ah (21 :3). The name Me
Rib-ah, applied to Kadesh-ah, is rendered
"strife/' from Rib, but in Je-Rub-Baal it is
rendered "plead," and so the lustful David says
( I Sam. 25 :39) "Blessing of Jehoah which Rab
the Rib of my ''Here-Path* from the hand of
Nabol," then sent for Abigail; as saying which
blessing multiplied the plea of his lions. But
the text is (Num. 20:12:13) "These the water
of Me-Rib-ah which it Rab or "multiplies" Je
hoah the Bene-Israel, and Kadesh them" ; hence
Mas-ah or "birth"-goddess is an Egyptian
equivalent for Me-Rab-ah, and shows that the
water was fecundating, and the shrine of the
*cHere-Path is sometimes a substantive (Isaiah 47: 3), not "shame" or "reproach." So, when Joshua (5 : 9) cut-oflf the foreskins, Jehoah said "Show me the ^Here-Path of the Egyptians from over them;" that is, the shown or uncovered (Galli-oth) part would be equal to that of the Egyptians,
who doubtless forbade circumcision to slaves. Also, Rachel,
who wept for children, says (Gen. 30: 24) "Aseph God my
f'Here-Path, and * * J-Oseph to me God one son;" that is,
so great her pangs, she asks God to take away her ^Here-Path
so that she may be taken away (or restricted) to one son; and so the name of Joseph was her protest; hence she dies at her next travail, naming the child Ben-Aon-i, evidently Ain-i, as crying "No sons!" so they called him Ben-Iamin or "son of a nurse" or Aman.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL i6i
"child"-giver or "multiplier"; comp. Ha-Rebah A-Reb-ah (Gen. 3:16); so Jehoah named
the shrine as an assurance of the increase of
Bene-Israel, to console Mosheh and his brother
whom he had condemned to death in the previous verse. Indeed the name Kadesh B-Arenna
should probably be Kadesh in Aran-Aa or the "Holy in the great Aron; so, Pa-Aran; which
would indicate that this was a shrine of some
phase of the Sun-god, such as ^'Hor or ^Hepera;
perhaps by the wild tribes called I-Shem-Aa
El, over whom as an infant the wandering
ha-Gar or " the stranger" * watched at the well
of the "Shining-Visions" or La'^h-ai-Ro-i, near
by.
10. Ha-Gar and miriam would thus seem
to connect with Renen-et or Mes-^Hen-et ; more probably however with the more celebrated and pronounced phase of "Hathor" or ""Het''Hor ("sanctuary-of-Horus") called Bas-t,
the cat-face aspect of divinity, regarded as exercising unusual influence on pregnant wom
en, and frequently depicted in the Mes-^Hen or "birth-room" (Budge). Kot-Esh-ah would even now be Arabic for "cat-woman." The Egyptians depict Qadesh as a goddess standing
* Ha-Gar also means "fugitive," as Shem in Egyptian



i62 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
on the back of a Ma-u or ''lion," and with them
Man was also ''cat" ; and they regarded her as
foreign; calling her also Ken-t, possibly Ca
naan-ah, as Chaldeans said Chena as the name
of that land. The name of the lion-goddess
Se^het of Memphis was only another name of
Bas-t ; hence the Ta-'Hash or "seal"-skins over the Mesh-Chan and Aron when reversed is
She'h-at or "lion"-skins.
II. The Mish-Chan is ordered by Jehoah
(Ex. 25:8-9), "Let them make to me a MiKadesh and will Shachan-eth me in their
midst, like all I show thee, the building of the
Mish-Chan," &c., and it will thus be seen that
Sha-Chan or "dwelling" became a Hebrew^
word of general import, though the Shechin
ah of the later Jews meant the sensible pres
ence or Chebed of Jehoah, while the original
use of the word was in a sacred sense (Ex.
24:16; Num. 5:3; Ezra 7:15, &c.) as in Egypt, it must seem. The Mish-Chan was divided
into the Kadesh place and the Kadesh Kadesh
im or "most holy," separated by a linen veil,
and in this latter was the Aron, and the chief
priest entered it only at the lom Cheppur, so
that it was also called house of the Cheppor
eth, rendered "mercy-seat," because perhaps



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 163
of the ^'Hepher or "scarab," placed on the dead body of all Egyptians as an emblem of resur
rection or new-birth, for at lom Chippur the
Sun is passing south of the equator, and into
a tomb that will be watched till it becomes the
cradle of the re-birth.
12. If the Exodus was historic it is cu
rious that we find no account of the people or the religion of Paran Kadesh-ah, whence the
Israel-i are said to have been accursed, and whence they turned back into a long wander
ing; and it is probable there was some such
shrine at one time; but, as I consider the story
mainly allegoric, it seems that Pa-Ran Kadesh
ah or Kadesh in Aren-Aa (B-xA.ren-Aa) is only
the entrance of I-Sera-El into his ''sacred cof
fin"; his Aa-Ber-ah or ''pass-over" boat of the Aa-Bera-im or "Hebrews"; whom Jehoah found in a land of Ma-Debar and as an eagle bore them on his Ae-Ber-ath (Deut. 32:10
11; "feathers," Job 39:13; "wings," Ps. 55:7). 13. Mosheh was Zephin-ah for three
months. This is the Zaphen-ath in the name Pharoah gave Joseph, and Ba-Aal Zephon or Tsephon. The Greeks made the word Typhon out of it, as they made Tyre out of Zur (Tsur).
It is probably the Egyptian word Tchetfi or "serpent," which as Zeph-aa and Zeph-aa-ni



1 64 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the Isaiah (ii:8; 14:29; Jere. 8:17) is made to read ''basil-isks/' but evidently the Aaraa,
the Asep-is or "asp" of the Greeks, emblem of
royalty and protector (Sa-f, ''he protects") of
lower Egypt; and from the Egyptian Sa-f we seem to have the Greek A-Sep and the Hebrew
lo-Seph, with the Tchetfi or Zeph-aa as this
Asp-Protector; so that the name Jo-Seph or Sep is probably Egyptian, and his name Zephen-ath Pa-Anea^'h is probably the Serpent
( — Protector) of the ''living" or Aana^h.*
Mosheh was therefore Zephin-ah or serpent
guarded; hence the shrines Mi-Zep-ah in GileAad and near Jerushalem are supposed to derive name from Zephah or "watcher," but
that the daughters of Israel went year after
year "to Tan-oth, to the daughter of le
Petha^'h," &c. (Judges 11 140), shows "serpent"
or Tannin (Ex. 7:9) worship; the Pe-Then
(Isaiah 11:8; Deut. 32:33, &c.) or Greek PyThon; the Mi-Pethen in the house of Dagon and in the temple of Jehoah ( i Sam. 5 '.4 ; Ezek, 9:3, &c.), where the monster gave name to the "threshold" or "door" it guarded, or took name therefrom, since in Hebrew the word
Pith-ah means a "hole." The connection of
* Pa-Aanea^h may be "house-of-Life" as Per is often abbreviated to Pa.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 165
Zephin-ah and Ba-Aal Zephon (Ex. 14:2, 9)
is important, for, if Zephon be the Greek Ty
phon, as Lenormant says, then the Zephin-ah or watch of the infant Mosheh is the feminine of Zaphon or Set, whose wife was "Nepthys"
as the Greeks called Neb-t-^Het, the "lady of
the house'' of the sky, and twin sister of Isis,
of whom she was a negative, as Set was of
Osiris, though Set finally became an evil force.
Set was represented in a stellar way with the
constellation Ursa Major or Mes^het, as Osiris
with Orion or Sa^'h, and this home in the "North," which in Hebrew is Zephon, seems to confirm the opinion that Ba-Aal Zephon was
Typhon or Set. The connection with a ser
pent or "basil-isk," Isaiah's Zeph-aa, arises
from the Egyptian myths which represent Set
usually as a serpent in his combats with Horus, and the Egyptians made and stamped under
their feet the form of a serpent at their festival
of the winter solstice. It is certain that the
Egyptians identified the Syrian deity Ba-Aal
with Set, or Sute^h, the Hebrew Zadok, the
Greek Styx or Satyx, for the inscriptions demonstrate the name Ba-Aal with the symbol
Sha. But Nepthys was not an evil concept,
and seems the assistant of Isis; and yet ap
pears to personify decay and its sequence re



1 66 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
birth. The name of Deity at Jerushalem was,
till the time of Ezra, Ba-Aal (Jere. 11:13),
that is. Set or El-Shad-ai, but Besh-eth or
''shameful thing," that is, Ja-Besh-ah, was not
necessarily Nephthys, though as "dry'' and
''drouth'' Ja-Besh may accord with the sterile
Egyptian. The name of Joseph as Zephan
ath Pa-Anea^'h certainly seems to identify him
with Set or Ba-Aal Zephon, and his burial at
Shechem accords with ''Het Se^'hem or "house
of the Sistrum" v/hich was a centre of the
worship of Nepthys in Egypt, and her alleged birth-place: and so Jerebo-Aam was son of
Neb-at, and was over all the laborers of the
house of Jo-Seph or Zaphen-ath Pa-Anea^'h.
It is possible, of course, to say that Mosheh
himself was this concept Joseph or Set since
it was to his serpent in the temple to which
incense was burned in the days of ''Hezek-Jah,
and which must have typefied him, but at least his Zephin-ah or "hidden" must be deemed a watchful serpent.
14. With all the advantages of his alleged
royal adoption, Mosheh was obscure till about forty years old. He sprung into notoriety by the murder of an Egyptian for beating a Hebrew. He escaped to Midi-an, that is, the "tall
of stature" or giant, like Haman's father Ha



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 167
Medatha. Here he became a shepherd for
Reaau-El or ''friend-of-his-God/' called also
le-Thero or "law." Back of the Madebar, at
the mountain of the God, "^Horeb-ah, appeared
to him Maleach Jehoah in a flaming fire from
the midst of the Sen-ah, that is, in Egyptian,
the "acacia/' In that tongue the 'Har-^Heb
was the "face-festival" when the figures of
their deities were shown to the people amidst
great processions; but in Hebrew the word
means "drouth,'' "dry," like Ja-Besh; and
^Hareb also means "sword," "knife." Sen-ah
is feminine of Sen or "brother," and perhaps
the acacia received name in Egypt from its bi
penate leaf and dual pennies, typefying brother
hood; Ta-Sen or Sen-at being a name of Isis
as "the sister" of Osiris, and A-Sen-ath was
wife of Jo-Seph. "Pleasure of the dwellings of
Sen-eh" (Deut. 33:16) may allude to Isis. The
flaming Sen-ah is of course feminine of Sin
Ai or "great-brother." It is not difficult to
understand that 'Horeb-ah was a shrine of
that form of Hathor or Isis called Ta-Ur or
"the Mighty," usually depicted with a knife or
sword, and also called Shepu-t, and Rer-t or
Lel-et, for I-Thero is itself a Hebrew word
that connects with the Phoenician goddess



1 68 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Thor-ah, whose name probably comes from Ta-Ur. 15. The Elohim said "For Ehe-Jeh with
thee," and a sign that Mosheh had been sent was that in the bringing out of the people from Mi-Zera-im he should serve "the Elohim'' upon that mountain, which might mean the God that dwelt upon it or was then upon it. Mosheh seems to have had no religion up to
that time, or at least did not know the name of
the God of his father, the God of Abraham,
&c. (Ex. 3:6); and his wife, as daughter of Reau-El, and evidently grand-daughter of ^-Sav by a daughter of I-Shemaa-El (Gen.
36:2-4), doubtless was meant as a Heathen; hence he asked the name of this God of Abraham, and was told that it was E-Heieh and le
Hoah (vs. 14, 15); subsequently (6:2-3) identifying Elohim and Jehoah and El Shaddai as the same; but Jehoah tells here that by this name Jehoah he was not known to Abraham and Ize^'hak and Jakob ; a statement which
is found difficult to explain in view of altars
built to Jehoah and conversations with him in which he is addressed by that name by these
patriarchs (Gen. 12:8; 13:18; 15:2; 22:14;
26:25; 28:21, &c.) ; but thus suggesting, by being first made known to Mosheh, that the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 169
word Jehoah is Egyptian, though Pharaoh did not know Jehoah as a name of Deity (Ex. 5: 2) ; yet, as appearing to Mosheh in a flame of fire, and Heh being Egyptian for "Flame,'' or Heh-v (Heh-f) ''his Flame," it might seem that E-Heieh or le-f loah would be understood by Pharaoh, especially as Bes-dwelling-in-Heh
f or ''Fire-in-his-Flame," probably the Jewish
Je-Bus, is named in the 17th chapter of the
Book of the Dead as one of the seven spirits
appointed by A-Nup or "A-Nub-is" to protect
the corpse of Osir-is ; and the syllable Je or le
in Je-Hoah is of no more moment than it is in names like Hoshua for Je-Hoshua (Num. 13: 8, 16), though probably it is the Egyptian word Aa or "great," as in la-Bez and Aa-Zab or "sorrow" (i Chr. 4:9) which are reverse
words. The text at Ex. 6:2-3 evidently in
tends in this composite document to assert that with this mission of Mosheh the name Je-Hoah first became known, but it seems from 4:1 that the Aaber-im did know who Je-Hoah was, and
that he had sent Mosheh was to be attested by
certain miracles he should perform. Chapter 6, however, as well as 4:19, seems to begin other account of the commission to Mosheh, as is must have been a favorite theme of the
priests.



170 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
1 6. The wonders wrought by Mosheh on his return to Egypt begin with his changing
the waters of the Nile and all its canals into
blood, so that the fish died, and this was done by him in the sight of Pharaoh, who merely
went into hrs house w^ithout protest, and with
out punishing the two men who wTought this calamity though he knew they were of an en
slaved people; but the object of these priest
craft stories appears when it is said (7:22; 8:18) the magicians attempted to bring about
the same calamities and could not, since they
thus seem written to attest the superiority of
Mosheh and of Jehoah, and to be taught to
children in the after times (10:1-2; 12:26-27)
of Ezra and the hierarchy when these writings
appeared.
17. Mosheh, like all the Egyptians, car
ried a rod or ''staff," called Mattah in Hebrew,
but which, with that of Aharon, must repre
sent the Ur ""Heka or ''mighty Enchantment"
of the Egyptians; a. serpent-head rod whereby the lips of the dead were touched in the other
world to enable them to speak, and was not the common rod; and so the wand of Mercury was adorned with two serpents. The "asp"^ or Aaraa in Egypt was an ornament worn in shape on the head-dress of the monarchs as an



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 171
emblem of sovereignty, or perhaps originally
to indicate their descent from or as representa
tives of the Sun, for it was also a solar type,
frequently depicted on the heads of deities, and especially deified as goddess Rannu who guard
ed orchards and infant royalty, as seen in
Hebrew story when Pa-Ran or ''the Ran" is the refuge of young I-Shemae-El, young David, and young Hadad; and it is very probable that the A-Ron or sacred ''Ark" of the Jews received name from some carving of Rannu on
its surface as was often done on tables in
Egypt ; while Aharon the first priest is a pecu
liar name, ^ian says the kind of serpent dedicated to the Egyptian ^ekulapius was
called parai-as, which is clearly Pa-Aaraa or "the Asp," and he was the Memphian third
person, son of Pata^h, called I-em-^'Hetep,
whom the Greeks called I-Mouth-is. The first battle in the Ma-Debar was at Reph-Id-im, where the rod and lad-im or "hands" of Mosheli were held steady, hence Raph-Iad-im
or "healer-hands," as also the healing of the
Seraph bites by the "brasen" or Ne'^hash Ser
aph tends further to identify Mosheh with the
serpent-cult, for it seems that a serpent was the worshipped symbol of him in the temple at
Jerushalem (2 K. 18:4), and called Na^'hash



172 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Tan ; and that this symbol of Deity was potent in Israel may account for the curse put upon
the Na'^hash for teaching Adam and ''Hav-ah how to procreate. The word Seraph seems to
mean "burning/' though also rendered ''serpent/' and in the later theology of Egypt and
the West the serpent was the symbol of the
divine concept Serap-is, identified by some with ^.skul-Apius, by Emperor Hadrian with
Christ.
1 8. It is asserted by most students that
Serap-is is the Greek form of the Egyptian
word Osar-'^Hapi, which means the ''hidden"
Osiris, but the bull-head Osar-'^Hapi was most
certainly an Egyptian concept anterior to and
distinct from the Greek concept which as a statue was brought by Pkolemy Soter about B. C. 300 from Sinope on the Euxine, and
which the Egyptian priests refused to allow
to be adored within their cities ; nor does it appear to me improbable that this Greek Serap-is was other than the Sarap-Adon or Sarpedon of the Iliad, whose death was bewept by his
father Zeus, and whose name in Phoenician and Hebrew as the "Burning-Lord" establishes
his identity with the solar myths, such as
Adonis, Shim-esh-on, Herakles, &c., as with the murdered Osiris, which concept becomes



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 173
after Sun-set the judge of the Under-World,
as also in Winter ; for, as son of the bull Zeus,
by the Tyrian Europa, that is, Aareb-ah or
the "West'' in Hebrew, as Zesa* means "fire"
in Egyptian, we have the Cretan-Carian Sarpedon or Serap-Adon as the Greek and Latin
Serap-is or Seraph-is; and this Serap-is is
represented enfolded by a great serpent, as his statues show. The Pentateuch was probably
written during the time of the first Ptolemies
in Egypt, when the cult of the classic Serap-is
was gaining in strength, and it seems easy to
suspect that the incident recited (Num. 21:49), when Mosheh reared the Seraph symbol as
Saviour, alludes to this worship; and this accords with the Heh or Je-Heh and with Bes or Je-Bus and their Egyptian meaning as "Flame" or "Fire." The Seraphs of the Isaiah
(6:2) have no similitude in Egyptian art or myth, but have in the Assyrian; while the Saraph-ah or "burning" made or not made for
their monarchs, as told in the late books (2
Chr. 16:14; 21:19), may have been rites of Serap-is such as his "nocturnal orgies" mentioned by Apuleius. The Ne'^hash-Tan image,
destroyed by ""Hezekiah, was evidently not the
* Or Sasa ; the Egyptians had no letter Z. Sasa or Zeza
may also give us A-Zaz-El.



174 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
end of the serpent worship, since the wife of
the reformer Josiah's son was Ne'^hush-ta (2
K. 24:8), and the "creeping-things'' of the
Ezekiel (8:10) seem to have been still later. The rod of Aharon became a Thanin in his contest with the magicians, and this word may connect with the Greek Py-Thon of Delphi, which Pi-Thon would mean ''serpent-mouth'' in Hebrew, though Pithen is rendered "asp"; but the rod of Mosheh when changed into a
^'serpent" at ""Horeb-ah is called Na^'hash, as
was the serpent of Eden, thus showing they
were not the same reptile as the Thanin or
"sea-monster" (Gen. 1:21), which has been
supposed a crocodile.
19. The Hebrews seemed to be like the Egyptians, who regarded the asp as an emblem
of sovereignty, and yet held the great imagi
nary serpent Aapep as a foe and a fear. The
huge serpent coiled about the figures of Serap
is is apparently an emblem of evil and of darkness, and so with the serpent which Hor-us
is depicted as spearing; but, besides the goddess Ran-nu, who perhaps gave name to the A-Ron or "ark" and to the region Pa-Ran, the great city and shrine Per-Uath or Pe-Uath in lower Egypt, which the Greeks called BUto, was the "house of Uath," who was nurse



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 175
of Hor-us, and hence an asp-goddess like Rannu, and from whose name as P-Uath it may be we have the Hebrew and Greek word Pith-en and the Greek Pythia at Delphi, for, as Delphi
was the most famous oracle in Greece, so Herodotus says Buto was the most popular oracle in Egypt; hence the mysterious word
Ath, which appears without translation in almost numberless phrases of Hebrew scripture,
may refer to these phrases as oracular or divine from the word Uath, while Ath-ama was in Egyptian a book or roll of papyrus, as the
papyrus plant is the hieroglyph Uath of her name; and so "virgin" or Par-Then-os may be Per-Uath, as also the Greek Ath-ena, and the Hebrew seer Nathan who had power over life and death; hence the proximity of a shrine so famous may have given the Jews their Na^'hash-Tan or -Than or serpent-Uath-an, de
stroyed by ""Hezekiah, supposed to be con
nected with Mosheh and the saviour-image he
is said to have made some seven centuries be
fore.
20. The serpent was not so general or
prominent a symbol on the Euphrates, but it was that of the deity Ea or Hoa, father of Merodach, and perhaps the same as Nebo and the Assvrian Nin. Ea is much the same as



176 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the Egyptian ''Thoth'' or Te'^h; coming from
the sea and teaching mankind; and so Mosheh
came from the sea (Isaiah 63:11). The Phoenician Taut was recognized as ^skulapius by
the Greeks, and the Phoenicians received their
reHgion from the Babylonians, so that these
deities doubtless represented Hoa or Nebo, as
the house of Saggil, the great temple at Baby
lon, attests its relation to ''Askelon" or A
Shekel-on, and perhaps to the valley of E
Shechol; the Chaldean Ishtar being the Aashtharth of Tyre, and the Greek sea-god PosEidon being probably the Chaldean Apisi or
''Ocean" and the Phoenician Adon or 'Xord/'
The town Nob-ah, ''the city of priests," was
near Jerushalem, and perhaps was feminine of Nebo, though the Egyptian god Num was also called Noub or ^Hnoub, and there was also
A-Nub-is, yet the priests at Nob-ah are called
priests of Jehoah when slain by Sha-Aul. Under his name Ea or Hoa this Nebo was the
especial deity of the city Is or Hit on the
Euphrates about one hundred miles above Babylon, but as Ea or Hoa he was considered
first and very anciently as the Earth-god, then
as lord of learning in later times. It is quite
possible that the Hebrew deity Jehoah bears his name, and the Arabic word Haie means



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 177
both ''life" and ''serpent," as in Hebrew and
Chaldaic "^Hai means "life" and "beast,"* while one of the names of "Thoth" was A, and it was
his word that created Earth. Hoa or Ea seems in places to have been deemed father of Merodach or Amar-Atuki, Accadiam for "Sunbrilliance," Lenormant says, and Merod-ach and Mosheh are connected in a queer genealogic fragment (i Chron. 8:17-18) where JeThero and Miriam are brother and sister of Mered who married a daughter of Pha-Raoh, a title apparently from the Egyptian Pha-Raa
or "the Sun," or from Pha-Aaraa, "the asp,"
worn on royal heads; for which latter reasons
the name Na'^hash or "serpent" is perhaps
given to the Kings of Moab; but there is no
evidence in what little is known of Meredach
to connect him with the serpent symbol, though
his great temple Saggil or Sakkul at Babylon
by name suggests Ae-Sekul-apios whose sym
bol the serpent was. 21. The serpent became perhaps a sym
bol of secular knowledge among the later Jews,
and this is opposed to dogma; but the alleged
reform of ""Hezek-Jah, strange to say, is not
* "And the Na^hash was more crafty than any ^Hai-ath of
the field which lehoah Elohim had made." But Aarum means "higher" as well as "crafty."



178 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
mentioned in the Isaiah (36: —39:), which de
votes four chapters to that reformer, nor does
the later Chronicles speak of any destruction by him of the serpent that Mosheh had made;
while the professed contemporaries of ''HezekJah, Hosea and Micah, say naught of this
iconoclasm. It is likely that the ''healer"-god
(Ex. 15:16) had this symbol till the Macca
bean rebellion caused the Jews to detest Greek
symbols of Deity.
22. In Phoenician theogony two brothers appear as sons of Amyntos and Magos, Greek forms perhaps of ""Hamen or ''heat" and El or ''great.'' These sons were Mi-Shor and Suduk. The account says Mi-Shor means the "free"
or "active," but it seems the "upright" or
"equitable," being the same as the name Ja
Sher (Josh. 10:13; 2 Sam. i :i8). It is further
stated that this Mi-Shor was father of the
famous scribe Taut, whom the Egyptians call "Thoth" (Ta'^hut) and the Greeks Hermes,
who originated letters. The brother Suduk is
clearly the name Zadok or Zedek, since the
author says it means the "just"; and it is
further said he was the father of the Kabir-i or Korybantes, whereas classic story makes Vulcan or Hephaestos, the Memphian Pata^'h,
father of the Kabir-i. Sute^h in Egyptian was



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 179
a name of Set, brother and foe of Osiris in
later times, and it is probable the Greeks con
tracted Sute^h into Styx; hence Aharon, as another name of Sute^h or Zadok, would be
A'^heron, as may well be suspected. * This con
clusion as to Aharon or Sute^h would make Mosheh or Mi-Shor a phase of Osiris, or per
haps of ""Heru-Ur or Horus the elder, whom perhaps the shrines Aar-Aar or "Aroer" represent, and ''Heru-Ur was considered by
the Greeks as Apollo, for it seems that in
Egypt he was deemed a personation of Day or
Light, with Set or Sute^h as his adversary.
In his "Isis and Osiris" Plutarch, howbeit,
says it was told that, after his battle with
Horus, Typho fled on an ass for seven days,
and when he arrived at a place of safety he begat Hierosolymus and Judaeus, but that this
story was told to give an air of fable to the
flight of Moses out of Egypt, and of the settlement by Jews of Hierusalem and Judea ; which
curious statement seems to show that Mosheh
was Set or Sute^h rather than Osiris; but the
real use of the story is the identification of
Typho with Set, and Set or Sutu'^h with the
* This mention of the mysterious Kabir-i and Korybantes as sons of Zadok or Aharon connects them with the Hebrew words Kaber or "pit," "sepulchre," and Koreban or ""vow-of-offering."



i8o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
chief name of Deity at Jerushalem, which made sacred the Hne of Zadok, and originated the story of Malachi-Zedek, King of Shalem, priest of El AeHon. Mi-Shor, as father of
Thoth of Hermes seems a reference to Mi-Zer,
as ''Egypt" was called by the Israelites, and
that people or country was thus perhaps per
sonified, as perhaps in the person of Mosheh
and his learning.
23. It is clear to me, however, that the
alleged sojourn and enslavement of the Hebrews in Mi-Zera-im was a story written to deter them from migrating thither, and that
the alleged journey into the ''Wilderness" is
another of the several stories of a descent in
to Hades, the Made-Bar or "great-pit"; in which case Mosheh is not more real than other
heroes of the religious or poetic fancy. In
deed, the Isaiah (19:20), which, as in case of
most all the several books other than the Hex
ateuch, speaks once only of the Egyptian episode, may have suggested the story, and even
the name of the hero, saying of those who fled to Egypt from the Chaldeans that at the cry
of their oppression (comp. Ex. 3:8-9) shall be sent to them a Moshi-Aa and a Rab and the Zil of them; that is, probably, "a Mosheh and
a chief and the deliverer of them"; yet "the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL i8i
Zil" in both texts cannot well mean ''to deliver,"
and usually Zil means "shade/' "shadow,"
"shelter." This chapter of the Isaiah, as in
all other portions of the Hebrew writings apart from the book Exodus, is not acrid toward the
Egyptians; and the very claim that is made
for that country as the birth-land of Mosheh
is evidently a source of pride to the Israelites.
And it must seem that if Josephus is correct in saying that the name M-Sheh is from the Coptic words Mo or "water" and Ushe or "saved," the Isaiah word Moshi-Aa, rendered
"saviour," would point to the Isaiah as the
origin of the Exodus allegory. This mean
ing of his name would connect him with the Egyptian words Mo'^hu-Aa or "great anointed," as perhaps with the Chaldaic word UshoGal or "exceeding great," and the Phoenician
Usho, identified with Bes, as I identify him
with ^sav the grandfather of Mosheh's first
wife.'*'
* David the son of Ishai was also an Ishaa or loshaa (2 Sam. 8: 6, 14), though "And Ishaa lehoah David in all that walked" is not very clear.



SECTION VI
I. The identity of Araun-ah the Je-Bus-i
with Bes would imply that he was also a hairy
god or beast-form. The Ar in his name may
be for Arieh or ''lion." But his name is sub
jected to suspicious variations, and a motive
may exist for this. There really is no such name as either Araunah or Oman as the English versions have it. In the Samuel the
first ''Araun-ah'' is "the Avaren-ah"; the sec
ond is Arane-Jah ; the last seven times we have
it as Araven-ah; while the Chronicler has it
Arenan. There is possibly an allusion to the
Aiver-im or "blind" (2 Sam. 5:6) and Pasa^'h from whom David took the town in the other
account, hence the first "the Avar-en-ah" ; but
there is no allusion to the Pasa^'h-im or "lame"
unless in 24:20 where Araun-ah sees the King and his servants Aober-im upon him, as Aober and Pasa^'h both mean "pass-over," and Aoberim is also our "Hebrews." Now, if we say
these two words are respectively Egyptian and
Chaldaic, as appears when "old-corn" or Aabur
and Pasa'^h appear together in Josh. 5:11, it



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 183
must seem that these words imply some
brotherhood of pilgrims, as "the Sa^'h" or Pa
Sa'^h means ''the traverser" in Egyptian; and we may also see that Aiver-im and Aaber-im
are the same; so that the Je-Bus-i, ''inhabitants
of the land" (2 Sam. 5:6), told David unless
he got rid of these, this band, he could not
enter, &c., as they did enter upon Araun-ah, for the Aabera-im were distinct from the
Israel-ites (i Sam. 14:21); but their ready
admission by Avaren-ah, after the angel of Jerushalem protected it from the angel of the
Ma-She'^h-ith, which latter had reached the
Garon, probably identifies Avaren-ah with the angel of Jerushalem who had stretched out
his hand to She'^h-ith or "destroyer"; for this
was a pass-over or escape of the town similar
to that of the Exodus ( 12 123) in some respects,
as also to the story of Abram and MalechiZadek who met in the vale of Shav-ah, and to
that slaughter of 75,000 of their Aob-i (Esth.
9:16) or "famihar-spirits" when Haman was suspended at the order of A^'ha-Shave-Rosh.
2. If, however, we take "Araunah" as the more frequent Araven-ah, we may suspect an idiom of A-Repha, as Rav-ah is rendered
"drunk," "satiated" (Isa. 34:5, 7; 43-24), and tending to show the Egyptian A-Rep or



1 84 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
"wine'' was connected with Repha or "giant"
and it would be in the nature of these ancient
stories to find that Jebus was taken from
giants.
3. All the several forms of Bus or Bez
imply brutality, violence, as Gibor-im Bus-im
or "treading-down" (Zech. 10:5); nor does
A-Bus or "fattened" (i K. 4:23) and "crib"
(Isa. 1:3) alter this assertion; but it is not
able that Arev-ah and Avri-oth are "manger"
and "stalls," hence "the Avaren-ah of the
Jebus-i" first spoken of does not seem a person
at all (v. 16), and later writers may have added
from V. 18 to the close. A probable supposi
tion, however, is that his name connects with
Aron, "ark," "coffin," "chest," a word which
may connect with the serpent-angel Ran-nu of
the Egyptians, whose figure was inscribed on
the lids of boxes, on tables of viands, &c., and who was guardian of gardens and infant
princes, as we see the figure of him especially
on the head-dress of queens; and so in their faith we find Ishmae-El and David and Hadad of Edom fleeing to Pa-Ran or "the Ran," while Auzz-ah I suppose was bitten when he put his hand on the Aron, and it was to be supposed that a serpent was in Gan-Eden. So,
Joseph tells his brothers when his cup was



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 185
found in the sack, "Know ye not that a Na•'hash detects a man?" from which we infer a
"serpent" was depicted on the cup. Ma^hen was the name appHed in Egypt to a long serpent, and Ma'^han-ah was the place to which Sha-AuFs descendants and David fled, and where Ja-Akob remained while fearing ^sav. The form Aren-Jah given "Araun-ah" may have been suggested by this guardian of sacred
persons and things ; and at least the Debar or "plague"-angel was stayed when the Garon
or "inn" was reached, for this "manger" or Avir-oth was to be no longer the home of
beasts and giants, but the Jerush-Aolem or
"possession-eternal" of Aabera-im or Pa-sa^'h
im. And yet I scarcely doubt, in reality, that
David was other than a phase of Bes; indeed,
"Jesse" or Ishai may be Esh-i or "Fires,"
but more clearly the Phoenician Usho, the Akkad and Chaldean Usho-Gal or "exceedinggreat," same as Sha-Aul the King. 4. That David was a youthful phase of Bes or Je-Bus may appear from the legend
of his feminine counterpart Did-o of Carthage, widow of Achar-Bas or Sichar-Bas, said to
have been a priest of Malack-Aareth at Tyre. Her name El-Isa seems to identify her with Is-is, while the name Sichar is probably that



1 86 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
of Sekar or ''shut-up" Osiris. The story of the foundation of Carthage by Did-o or David
ah is of course unhistorical, and she was
merely the local deity, it must seem. The
Romans called the town Car-tago, the Greek name was Kar-Chedon, but the people there
called it Kar-Thad-a or ''Fortress of Thad-ah.''
Thad-a is perhaps the correct form of the name
which the Latins called Did-o; but, as one form of the Egyptian T or Th was much the same as D, it might seem that Dad or David is the same as the Egyptian Thatt-u or Dadd
u, the name of Ba-en-Dadd-u or -Thatt-u, which city the Greeks called "Mendes," and
with which accords the name of Osiris as OsarDad or Osar-That. The Ba or "ram" of Dadd-u would accord more certainly with
theAa-Tud-i, "he-goats," "chief-ones" (Gen.,
31:10; Isa. 14:9), which may be another form of Thad or Dad. Osar-Dad is represented often in female apparel, and most
sensuous expression of face, while the
symbol Dad or That has been suspected
as phallic; points of accord with the
amorous character of David. But at Rome
there were cults of Tat-ia and of Ma-Tuta
which could not well be the same as Did-o, and they may connect with Nefer Tut-u or "good



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 187
hand-maid" which was the title of the chief priestess at Memphis, while Neter Tut-u or
''divine hand-maids" were an order of priest
esses in Egypt. The earlier name of CarThada was evidently Bozra, which the Latins called Byrsa, which word in Hebrew or Phoe
nician would mean "strong," "high," "inac
cessible," "cut-off," if the word is the Bozr
ah of Edom, and is also rendered "vintage," "vintagers," and Bozer-ah may be the same
word as Busir-is, as the Greeks called the town and shrine Per-Ausar or "House of Osiris" in Egypt; but in either case its meaning ap
proaches the usual ones of Bes, Bez, and forms
of these. The statue of ^sculapius at the
summit of the citadel Bozra probably assists
in explaining these suggestions, and yet the Phoenician Eshamun and the Egyptian I-em
'^Hetep, both identified by the Greeks with
^sculapius, were connected with Pata^'h, the
former as one of the Kabir-i, classically sons
of Vulcan, the other as that form of Thoth at Memphis who was son of Pata'^h, though Za
dek is the name the Phoenicians called the father of Eshamun, and Sute^'h was an Egyption name of Set, hence perhaps the classic
river Styx, as also Melechi-Zadek. David, like
Eshamun, was the eighth son, and Ishai, who



1 88 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
as Usho was perhaps also called Boaaz at BethLe'^hem, would thus be Zadek; hence David's sons were priests (2 Sam. 8:18) though not
of the line of Levi as required. 5. The magnitude of David was almost
that of classic Hercules. "These words of Da
vid the A'^heron-im, the Geber, the risen above,
Meshia^'h of God" (2 Sam. 23:1). Giants fight under him; though later thought (2 Sam. 21:
19) makes him above the petty feat of killing
Goljath; and the later Chronicles omit wholly the flight from Abesh-alom. The A-Bish-ai or Ab-Ishai of these confused accounts (2
Sam. 21:17; 23:18) seems the I-Shab or Ish
Ab of another place (23:8) if we reverse, the
letters, and probably refers to Bes. Another
Gibor is Sham-ah, son of Ag-e the Reri or ''the
cursed," perhaps Haman the ''cursed" Agag-i, which Sham-ah or "the famous" slew the Philistines when they were gathered to ""Hai-Jah
or the "beast-Jah," not "a troop," though it
may be "beast-ess," ""Haii-ah, for this was in a
field of lentiles, and the Philistines adored Aash-Tor-eth or Ta-Ur (i Sam. 31 :io), while
""Haii-ah is the "beast" that Jakob supposed had devoured Joseph. Another Gibor was grandson of a man ''Hai (2 Sam. 23:20) from Kabeze-El or the "herd-god," and this Bena



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 189
Jahu slew the double ''lion-god'' of Moab, &c.,
but as ''son-of-Jahu" the father seems Jeho
ladaa or the "wise-Jehoah," hence was set over David's Shemaa-et or court of ''hearing."
6. The Hebrew stories transfer us into a
Wonderland. An ass is made to speak, trees
hold converse, giants slay a thousand men with an ox-goad or a jaw-bone, and silver was
as stones in the streets of Jerushalem. Chaleb or "dog" is the companion of Mosheh, but as
son of le-Pun-ah, reverse for "the Anup" or
"Anub-is," and also as son of Kenaz, the Greek
Kynos and Latin Canis, one readily sees that
this local deity of "^Heber-on was the Egyptian
Anubis; ""Heber meaning an "ally" or "joined
together" ; as, indeed, its former name Arabaa
or "four" implies cohabitation of women with
beasts (Lev. 18:23, "lie-down" or Rabaa) ; but this may have been a reproach because of the
cult of Anup or Chaleb, for the reverse of Arabaa is Aabera or "Hebrew," and Kiri-oth Aabera would be walls of "Hebrew" if we use our form of the word, which Aabera or "Hebrew" was the great man among the Aanak-im,
and was father of the Aanak (Josh. 14:15;
15:13)7. ^'Hebron, which also means "charmer,"
"enchanter," is set down as the home in life



190 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
and death of Aberaham and Sar-ah, some
centuries before Chaleb is supposed to have
driven out the Aanak, and some centuries later
it is said it became the capital of the ''He
brews," and it would be a singular conclusion
if it could be made to appear that Aabera and
not Arebaa was the correct name of their sup
posed giant ancestor, and that he was the same as Abera-Haman or the ''strong-man"
(-much), or Ab-Ram or "lofty-father," for
that Abraham was gigantic appears not only from the Ham or Haman of his name but from
the cave Ma-Chepel-ah or "double" cave where he was buried, and which was at ""Hebron then
owned by the children of ^Heth or "terror";
but it is curious that at Purim when the Aa
bera-im curse Haman they forget that AberaHam is connected with Ezekiel's Haman-Gog and with Haman the A-Gag-i, as Elo-Him may
be also, at least by name. The son of ""Heth or
"terror," perhaps ""Hai-eth or "beast-like," that
is ""Hi or Bes, was Aepher-on, who as a "roe
buck" may represent Set, of whom the gazelle
was a symbol, or it may be the "dust" in the
sense of "many," "much"; but these ""Het-i or
"^Hit-ites" called Abera-Haman (Gen. 23:6) a Nesie Elohim or "prince-of-God," yet he
prostrated himself twice before them. The



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 191
cave was before Ma-Mere, which is another
name of ""Heber-on (23:19; 35:27), but is else
where (14:13) with his brothers called Ba
Aal-i Ber-ith of Abera-Ham, and fights in
alliance with him when the Arabaa or "four''
kings ""Heber themselves (14:3) against the western tribes, smiting the Repha-im, the Aamalek-i, the Amor-i, &c. ; and without Abera-Ham the account may be read (v. 13) ''Ma-Mere the A-Mor-i, brothers A-Shechol, and brothers Oaner and Ham, Ba-Aal-i
Berith,'' &c. ; this Ham being rendered "these,"
but it is Ham again in v. 24, and compare v.
5
; so that "four" or Arebaa applies to this
story of Kiri-oth Arebaa or "Fortress of the
Four," otherwise ''Hebron or the "allies,"
otherwise Ma-Mere or "fearful." But as Kir
or "wall" implies "resistance" (Lev. 26:21,
28, "contrary") or hostile "meeting," the words Kiri-oth Arebaa may mean the "Four
Resisters" as against the four resisted who had
beaten the five kings as well as the giants ; so
that the story is set forth to explain the name
of ""Heber-on or the "alliance" where Abera
Ham had settled in the Elon-i or "inns" of
Ma-Mere (13:18), just after the promise (v.
16) that his seed should be as the Aepher of the Earth, which refers to Aepher-on from



192 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
whom the double cave was bought. Ma-Mere was an Amor-i, and it seems the cave was
bought of a son of ''Heth, but we find allusion
to them in the promise to Noa^'h (9:2), "and your Morae and your ""Hith shall be over all
the 'Hai-ith" or ''beast-kind/' &c.; and the
Ezekiel (16:3, 45) says to Jerushalem "the A-Mor-i were thy father, and thy mother a
""Hith-ith"; all which tends to show that these people were super-human or un-human. MaMere or the "terror" was perhaps a woman,
somewhat like la-Ael the wife of ''Heber, and
murderess of Sisera; and at the near-by Beth
Le^'hem w^as the shrine of Mara or Naa-Ami the widow of Eli-Melech or Molech; who may well be suspected as Mer-t or the "beloved" of
Pata'^h, that is, Se^het the lion-goddess of
Memphis; while Debor-ah or the "feverplague" fury who dwelt under the Ta-Mar tree
and praised the ferocity of la-Ael, and Ta
Mar who made of the lion Jehud-ah a Buz, seem this concept of the avenging heat of the Sun; hence Ma-Mere or Am-Mere, "motherfearful," perhaps, who may have given name as their deity to the A-Mor-i.
8. These A-Mor-i dwelt in 'Hazazon Ta
Mar and in the Mount of ""Her-es (Gen. 14:7;
Judges 1:35); ''Hazaz meaning to "cut," to



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 193
"hew," and ^'Heres is rendered the ''Sun" in places, and evidently "Horus,"* the frequent emblem of whom is a lion. Whether, how
ever, "^Hebron suffered from the ill-repute of
its people or not, it may be seen that it was the
earliest seat of the Aabera-im, and it was first
there that Abera-Ham was called "the
Aaber-i" (Gen. 14:11), while it seems they
were a distinct tribe from the Israel-i (i Sam.
14:21), and the ""Heber or "alliance" with the
Amor-i and Pelisheth-im was "as beforetime"; David himself with his Aabera-im marching
against Sha-Aul with these latter. It would
not be far afield, perhaps, to say that Arebaa
the father of the Aa-Nak was a form of the name Abera-Ham as well as of Aabera, and
that his was an early name of the giant deity
of ^'Hebron appropriated by later legend as
ancestor of the Aabera-im. That Chaleb or
"Anub-is" gave his daughter Aa-Ches-ah to
Aa-Theni-El or "lion-god," whose son was
'Hath-ath or "terrible," that is, "beastly," in
dicates the same cult, and that there the sons
of ^'Heth still adored beasts as types of God.
9. The Phoenician brothers Shame-Merum
*The correct reading of the cited text of Judges (1 : 35)
is "and Jo-El the Amori dwelt in Mount cHeres," etc.; and
now why should Jo-El be omitted?
13



194 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
and Usho are said in their legend to have been
born of the giants. The first, whose name
seems to mean ''heaven-high/' learned how to
build huts, as Jakob built Such-oth or ''booths,"
and dwelt at Tyre where ''Hiram the architect
was perhaps the same. Usho built the first ship, and learned how to make garments of
skins, hence was evidently Melek-Areth the
''skin-king," or yEsav or Shimesh-on or Eli
Jahu or Bes, or other "hairy" hero like Her
Akles, whose name seems the ''Heru-Akel or "Horus the Lion" of the Egyptians. And yet Usho seems the same as the Phcenician
^'Hushor-Pata^i, whom the Greeks identified with Hephaestos and Zeus Meihch; and ^'Hushor seems ''Hez-Ir or "swine," connected
with the rites of Osir-is (Isaiah 66:17), and
perhaps alluded to in the Job (38:31) as MoShech-oth Chesil ta-Pata^'h, rendered "bands of
Orion loosen," as Osiris was identified with that
constellation, which the Egyptians called Sa'^h
or "traverser," that is, Pa-Sa^'h, and the Arabs
call Orion "giant" or Nephele, while Moshech
oth means "drawn," "distended," "tall," as if
by "fetters," "cords," and so Pa-Sa^'h or
"lame." Gesenius here catches the reversing
process of the Hebrew, which I herein estab
lish, when he points out that Ches-il and Sach



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 195
el, both rendered "fool," ''folly," are the same
word; in which case there must have existed
some prudential motive; but the reverse goes
further, and we find that Ches a ''cover" and
Such a "cover" are the same; hence Such-oth
or "booths" was a "tents"-festival of grapes
and fruits, evidently sacred to Ches-ah or the
"throne"-goddess Is-is, when Ches-El or
"Orion," that is, "Osir-is," flames in the au
tumn sky; wherefore, it must seem, the month Chisel-en, parts of November and December, called by modern Arabs Rab-y or "great," and
curiously by the Persians of the old time Adar.
In this connection it may be noted that the re
verse of Si^h-or, a name in Hebrew for the
Nile, is Ro-'^Hes, which in Chaldaic means "in
undation," and in Hebrew to "bathe" the body,
and Ro-'^Hes may easily be Ari-'^Hes the lion
god of Debet or "Aphrodite-polis" in upper
Egypt, who was son of the lioness Bas-t, but
doubtless a phase of Osiris, perhaps of David.
10. The Phoenician Usho, however, seems clearly the Akkadian and Chaldean Ushu-Gal
or "excelling-great" or "ogre,"* the Assyrian
Basham or "excellent," or Chaldean Bosh or
"bad"; whence the hero King "Saul" or Sha
* F. Lenormant, "Beginnings of History."



196 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Aul, perhaps She-Gal or "ravish" (Isa. 13:16;
Zech. 14:2), though translators make She-Gal "queen"* (Nehe. y,2\ Dan. 5:2), while King Ashur-Nezir-Pal calls himself a powerful Ushu-Gal; and Sha-Aul "was Geb from his shoulders and upward than all the people." Yet in the Job we have the word Aash or Aish understood as the constellation Great-Bear,
which may connect with Usho, and possibly the Latin word Ursus, as it will be seen herein that Aash is in the name of Aash-Tor-eth Aash in Egyptian meaning "many," "much." It is more clear to me, however, that King ShaAul and the Arab month Shawwal, the hot month August, so connect that the king is a
solar type, as I take Usho or Malach-Aareth
and ''Heru-Akel and Herakles ; but so the giant
Orion appears conspicuous in August, and may among many have been held as the giant whom
the hot Sun has summoned to help as his Sa'^h or "messenger," "runner," as Egyptians called
this constellation, or which holds the Sun in
the captivity of night, or is held. It seems to
me that this Egyptian word Aash or "much" enters into the name Aes-Av or Aeshav, as Af
is the "flesh" or "body" of the dead or night
* She-Gal is evidently to me, in these two texts, as explained elsewhere, "catamite."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 197
Sun. Aes-Av is clearly the Phoenician Usho,
probably the Arab Aash or "bear," also ''bur
den-carrier/' hence Aa-Zeb or la-Bez the "toiler''; but as Aes-Av his name suggests
Shave, rendered "idol," "false," "evil," "vain";
hence "Not shall you utter the name of Jehoah your God to Shave" (Ex. 207) ; "to Shave do
you make yourselves fair" (Jere. 40:30) ; and
in other texts (Ps. 31:6; Mai. 3:14) there
seems a personage; this of the Malachi read
ing, "Saying, Shave a servant of God, and what Bez-Aa-like our Shemar-en and our Shemaret," Acha-Shave-Rosh, to whom Eseter or Hadas-ah went, is the "Evil-Brother-Pos
sessed" or "Head-of-Evil-Brothers," but as
similated to the Persian word Kh-Shai-athia or
"King," while Vash-tiis a reverse of Shav-et; and so Jehudah married the daughter of Shavva, not Shua, whose surviving son was
Shel-ah or ha-Lesh "the lion."
II. The most signal exploits of Usho
were done under the name Hoshe-Aa (Num. 13:8, 16; Nehe. 8:17), who performed the most prodigious of all miracles by stopping the Sun
a whole day, and one account claims that he
exterminated the C^anaan-i ; and the shrine of this monster at Timen-ath ""Heres or (reverse)
Sera^'h shows the solar character of Usho or



198 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Jehoshu-Aa, for '^Heres is ''Horus" or Sun
light, and Timen is evidently Tum-On or
Atum the Egyptian god of Sun-set, special
deity of On or Annu, which the Greeks called Helio-polis, and which name Atum perhaps is Edom or ^sav who was "red" or Edemon-i; yet the connection of Hoshe-Aa with the liongod Shu or Shua seems probable, and in Egyp
tian his name means ''light," ''heat," "dry";
but it would be difficult to connect the mean* ings of the Chaldean Ushu-Gal and the Egyp
tian Shu as here given. Ie-Petha''h or
"Jepthah," the asserted son of Gile-Aad and
of a Zan-ah, seems the same as "'Hushor-Pata'^h or Usho, the Hebrew Hoshe-Aa or "Joshua," but this phase of the demi-urge was east of
Jordan, and his name derived directly from the
Memphian name for Deity, Pa-Ta^'h.
12. Egyptians depict Bes or ''Hi as an exaggerated Pata'^h; having a hideous head and
brutal face, covered largely with hair, and a
club-like tail and robust yet bowed legs. He
was an ogre, but is often represented with a musical instrument and singing. The Greek Pan and Priapus and Hercules and Hephsestos are phases of Bes, who was often a protector of the innocent, and was merry-hearted till aroused. The goddess Ta-Ur or "the Mighty'"



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 199
is somewhat a feminine counterpart of Bes, and
she is also called Shep-ut and Rel-et or Lel-et,
and the Hebrew Aash-Tor-eth, who is often associated with Ba-Aal, is probably Ta-Ur,
and so Lil-ith and De-Lil-ah; and so the He
brew word Tire or Tare, ''fearful/' "terrible,"
"awful," may be derived from the name TaUr; as the Tare-Dam-ah or "deep-sleep" that fell on Adam and Abraham and Sha-Aul (Gen.
2:21; 15:12; I Sam. 26:12) all seem at least a play on her name as the "red-terror" or "bloodyterror" ; while the Sha-Baz who caught hold of Sha-Aul (2 Sam. 1:9) was not "anguish" but more probably Usho-Bez; and so Shobach or "thick-boughs" who caught A-Besh-Alom is evidently Usho-Bach or Usho the "entangler,"
perhaps the "Ne-Buch-im they in the land"
(Ex. 14:3) being his followers, and connecting
with ^'Ha-Besch the Arab word for "confused," "mixed," applied to and from which we get the
name Abyss-inia, where ""Ha-Bes was the liongod. I-Shemaa-El and Shel-omeh each had a daughter named Bas-Am-eth or "beast-maid,"
unless it be the Assyrian Basham of "excelling"; and one married ^sav and the other was wife of A'^hi-Maaz or "angry-brother," if
not angry "^Hai or "beast." The la-Bish-ah where Sha-Aul was buried under the Eshel was



200 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
perhaps the shrine of some feminine counter
part of Bes or Besh, and Ja-Besh is rendered
"dry," ''drouth/' implying heat, yet it must be
the Chaldean word Besh or "bad," the Hebrew
"shame," while Sha-Aul himself evidently
typefies the Sun of Summer. David's A-Bish
Ag, sought to give him "heat" or ^'Ham, is a
more certain form of the same, as Ag is per
haps an abreviation of Agag, which in Arabic
means "flame," "to burn," but was perhaps a Chaldean Igag or Sky arch-angel. And she may connect with Meth-Eg the Anim-ah, not
"bridle of the mother-city," perhaps; but
"Isha-a Jehoah David in all that walked" (2
Sam. 8:1, 6, 14), which suggests Usho instead
of "gave-victory."
13. Certain friends of David, in the revolt
of A-Besh-alom, bore the similar names of A
Bish-ai or Ab-Ishai, ""Hushai, Shobi the son of
Na^'hash or "serpent," while among his foes
were Sheb-aa, A-'^Hi-tophel or "beast-fallen,"
&c., and this Sheb-aa was of Har Ephera-im, that place of mystery which may be named for
the Egyptian Heru em Per-t or "Coming-forth
by Day" of the departed soul ; a phase of which
survives perhaps in the feast of Pur-im when
winter is ended and Per-i or "fruits" came



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 201
forth with the Sun in Egypt in the season of
Per-t or ''growing."
14. In the story of Ja-Bez or Aa-Zab,
"sorrow," rather the Aa-Zab or "laborer," just as Adam was cursed with "labor" or Aa-Zab, we find sinister names; such as E-Shaton (Shat or Shad was in Egypt the god of slaughter),
Shu'h-ah or "destroyer," Te"hin-ah or "suppliant," "Beth-Rapha or "house-giant," Chaleb
or "dog," Kenaz or "hunter," Pasea^h or the "lame," &c, all men of Rech-ah or "length" (Arcch). They are put down as descendants
of Jehud-ah or the "splendid," who as Had-ad was evidently the same as Dad or David, and
a solar type; his wife seeming also to be E
Pherath-ah (i. Chr. 4:1, 4) as ''Hur was son
of both, but certainly was the same as Chaleb
(2:19) the father of ^Hur or "Horus," for Epherath-ah was evidently a woman, the Greek Aphrodite, the Egyptian of which would be Pha-Raa-Da-t or "the Sun's gift"; hence she was Le'h-Em or "Shining-Mother"; hence
Beth-te'hem of Je-Hud-ah, where Dad or David was son of Ishai or Usho, called Bo
Aaz there, and so Ushu-Aa or "Jes-us." The Bechor or "first-born" of Epherath-ah was "^Hur, which means a "cave," but also "white,"
and Buz or "white" gives the word Byss-us for



202 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
white or white-linen, as in the Esther ( i :6) both words are used; hence Bo-Aaz or Bes and ''Hur seem the same ; and so Bozez and '^Harar
both mean ''glowing," ''bright," "shining," as
the Arab word Lu'^h means, hence Lu'^h-oth or
"tablet"; and so the Le^'h-i or "jaw-bones,"
that is, "rays," with which Shimesh-on wrought death, and which as Lux passed even
into the Latin; and so ""Hur's first-born was Aur-i or "lights," which was very natural if we read that he and not Epherath-ah was
father of Beth Le'^h-Em. The grandson of 'Hur was the Maleach Be-Zal-El (Ex. 31:1, &c.), "a worker in-the-Abyss-of-God," the same as the Maleach ''Hur-am of Tyre, it must
seem, which latter built the temple without noise of axe or hammer; and both A-Zel and
''Heram are rendered "reserved," "set-apart,"
perhaps in a subservient or sinister sense, since
both were laborers, and labor was deemed a
curse. Indeed, the Egyptians, whose Se^het
or "Field" of Aal-u was a garden, not seeing how food would grow without labor, but also
not understanding that the blessed could work
the field, deposited with every corpse a clay
figure of a man; a custom they continued till
the Moslem conquest, and this substitute was
called a Shabti, which as one who gives "rest"



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 203
would serve well as Hebraic; and Maleach or ''worker" is the Egyptian word Mena^h or "worker." 15. At the famous meeting of la-Aakob and ^sav, the former asks that he may go "to the foot of the Maleach-ah which before him,"
and to the foot of the children, till he arrives
"to my Adon of Seair-ah," and this Maleach-ah
(fem.), perhaps one of those that met him at
Ma-'^Hena-im, not the man that wrestled with
him, could not well be "cattle," but an angelic
worker, for they at once went to Such-oth, and built a house "to him," and to his Ma-Kan-ah
made Such-oth, that is, to the Egyptian Se^het, who must have been a goddess of "fields" or
agriculture, as Se^h also in Egyptian means
"plough"; but this building to Ma-Kan-ah or
"possessor-ess" (usually "of cattle" imphed)
suggests Kain (Gen. 4:1), a Kan-ith man of
Jehoah, the first to build a city, but who lived a Naa or "wanderer" when driven from above the ground ; wherefore Tubal-Kain or the "lust
ful" or "beast-like" (Lev. 18:23) Kain, was. perhaps the same ; and Tubal-Kain was a Lot
Esh, rendered "forger," but "hidden-fire," implying "magic," hence was son of Zill-ah or "shade," and so Be-Zale-El the Maleach and •^Huram and Kain and Tubal-Kain seem of the



204 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Hadas-im in the Ma-Zull-ah (Zech. i :8), who walk the Earth (v. lo) as Kain wanders when
on it.
1 6. Kain, evidently son of Na^'hash, as the
story of the eating of the fruit seems to imply,
may possibly be El Aeli-on, rendered "God
Most-High,''^ called "Kon-eh of Heaven and
Earth" (Gen. 14:19; 22), as in Assyrian Kai
van, easily contracted to Kain, means "mosthigh,'' same as Sak-Ush in Akkadian; and as Suk-Ush is a name of Ishtar, Aish-Tor-eth, the
horned As-Tar-te, &c., the Ma-Kan-ah or
"cattle" at Such-oth may suggest that she was goddess there, as she was more than a thousand years after the supposed time of Ja-Akob (2 K. 17:30), and appears to have been a
goddess of the ancient giants (Gen. 14:5 ; Deut. 1 :4) ; wherefore ''Hiram wrought near Such
oth (i K. 7:45-46), to which the Maleach-ah came with Ja-Akob (Gen. 33:14). Of the
Kain-ites was Ja-Ael or the "lofty," wife of
""Heber, and assassin of Si-Se-Ra, evidently a
giant-ess, for the Kain-i were a band of Midi
an or the "tall," like the Med-atha the father
of Haman the Agag-i; but Ja-Ael or "wild
goat" (i Sam. 24:2; Job. 39:1; Ps. 104:18)
* EI Ael-ion rather means the "God Above," as in Ba
Aal or "in the Above;" so Ja-Ael who murdered Sisera.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 205
suggests a connection of the murderess with
the Seair-ah or ''she-goat" of ^sav, &c. In
any case it would be expected that a Ma-Leach
should come and build for Ja-Akob. 17. If Ma-Leach or "worker'' is not the
Egyptian Manea^h, "worker," and we look to
the Chaldaic, we find the man-god Merodach called Mulu-Khi or "man-god," as Lenormant
renders it; clearly the old Akkad third person
Mul-ge, who was lord of the Un-Seen world, and became Bel the demi-urge of a later time, that is, "Merodach" or Marduk; but whether we get from this Malach or "King," or Ma
leach or "worker" and "angel," is not clear,
perhaps both ; yet, like the Egyptian word, both
imply an active agent, a Demi-Urg-os or
"worker for the people," the Greeks said. A
personage of this sort must be Titanic ; and the
Pele at the annunciation of Shimesh-on (Judges 13:18) seems a Ne-Phel-im or "giant," hence
"wonderful," and connects this Maleach Jehoah with his appearance Nore (v. 6) or "fiery" very, with his son the gigantic Shimesh-on or Bes or Malach-Aareth, the Sun of Summer. It is curious, however, that Maleach, or the Egyptian word Manea^h as "worker," has the same meaning as Amon, rendered "Master-Workman" (Prov. 8:30); "to form,"



2o6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
^'to shape"; hence Haman the Agag-i; Te
Mun-ah or "shape" (Job 4:16; Ex. 20:4) ; the
Ma-Mon of the days of Jesus (Mat. 6:24). 18. It does not appear that la-Aakob com
pHed with his promise to go to his Lord of
Seair-ah, and the reason may be that Ja-Aakob
typefies the Sun-rise. In Egyptian the moun
tain of Baa^h-a, the reverse of which is A^haab, meant the Sun-rise, and Man-u was the moun
tain of Sun-set, while ''mountain" was their
word Set, the Har and Gib-aa of the Hebrew.
The night ''wrestle" was Abek, which initia
tion was at the Aaber of la-Bok, both of which
seem forms of his name; but the place was the
same Ma-'^Hena-im which he named for the Maleach-im, and Ma-'^Hen or "camp" also
means "grace" or "favor," that is, of the Adon
of Seair-ah or Edom, who was born Edemoni,
"red," which sounds like Ta-Man-u or (in
Egyptian) "land of Sun-set"; but Ma-^Hen-a
may suggest the Egyptian boat of the Sun
called ""Hen-nu, in which the Sun "passed
over," or Aaber* in Hebrew, and which boat
*Note that Aaber is used five times in Gen. 32:21-23,
The same profusion is notable in the "pass-over" or Aaber of the Israel-i under Jehoshuaa, and at the return of David over Jordan from Ma-^Hena-im in the Aaber-ah or "ferryboat."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 207
was evidently the Seair-ah or oryx-barge "in
the way of Seair-ah" (33:16).
19. The "messengers'' sent to ^sav by
la-Aakob were also ]\Ialeachs, and are fully as
much entitled as the others to be translated
*'angels"; nor is it supposable that the same
writer would use the same word in a different
sense in a following verse (32:3-4); hence it must be that the Maleachs at Ma-^'Hen-eh were
used as envoys to TEs-slv, in the field of Edom,
to find ''Hen (v. 6) ; and that "servants" or Aebad-im (vs. 6, 16) could not perform such
high function is notable; so that these "mes
sengers" were evidently angel-workers like
''Hur-am and Be-Zale-El. But certainly the
story is somewhat the same as that of Israel
fleeing before Pha-Reaoh (Ex. 14:19; comp. 13:20-21), and that of Jehoshuaa when he met the Sar Zebaa (Josh. 5:13-15), who here plays a vague part, similar to that of ^s-av, or that
of the Maleach-i ; but in case of the Aaber or "pass-over" of David to and from Ma-^'Hena
im-ah, Zibaa the outcast recalls the captain Ze
baa (Aa-Bez, if reversed), and the name ChiMaham or "like Ma-Haman" suggests the giant Haman, while the only one called "a Maleach of the God" is David himself (2 Sam. 19:27), and this by the Pa-Sa'h or "lame"



2o8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Mephi-Besh-eth, who as Memphis- or Moph''Shame" must^stand for Pata^'h or his Syrian
type Bes or Bosh or Usho.
20. Egyptian tablatures depict Bes or ""Hi
with a tail, on which he is often seen to squat;
but Assyrian ogres or monsters all have wings. Bo-Aaz had a Chanep or "wing" it must seem, for Ruth (3 19) asks him to expand his Chanep
for that he is a Go-El. This word is rendered
''near-kinsman," "redeemer," "avenger," "polluted," but Ge or Go means the "high" or "up
raised," "majestic" ; hence Go-El or the "lofty
God," akin to the Akkad word Gal-u, perhaps,
that is, ''big," "excelling." Ba-Aal Chanep or
"winged Ba-Aal" (Prov. 1:17; Eccle. 10:20) certainly seems some violent persons "greedy
of gain" or Bez-aa Bez-aa. The Chanep of the Me-Ail which David cut from Sha-Aul (i.
Sam. 24:4) does not disprove this view, since
the giant was not naked, and the Me-Ail seems
a "wild-goat" or Ael-skin, like the Seair or "hairy" ^sav and Eli-Jahu.* Nebu-ChadNegar's Seaire became like an eagle's, which probably means he became winged. It was on
wings of "eagles" or Neshar-im that Jehoah
says (Ex. 19:4) he bore Bene-Israel out of
*The "robe" or Me-Ail (1 Sam. 2:19; 28:14) of ShemuEl was a goat-skin or fleece of the wild-goat.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 209
Egypt to Har Sinai; a statement, contrary as it is to the condemnation of the Chaldean
monarch, tends to identify Jehoah with ""Har
or "Hor-us," as he certainly seems so identified
when called ''Jehoah the Haras" (i K. 18:30), rendered "the Lord that was thrown down"; for the ''hawk" or Bak is the hieroglyph of Horus (whence perhaps Bakch-as, as Neshar
may give us Dio-Nysi-us) ; and in the cited text Ba-Aal or Set, the Egyptian mountain or des
ert god, was silent, while Jehoah's altar was
le-Repe by the hairy Bes or Eli-Jahu in the
presence of A^'heab (or Bea^'ha) at Charam
El, where doubtless the "vineyard" or Charem god had a memorable shrine; for le-Repe or
"healed" suggests the Egyptian "wine" or PaArep, the good Priap-us of the Greeks; but he
was answered by fire (vs. 24, 38) as well as
rain ; a story which separates Ba-Aal from the Melach-Aareth, Molech, &c., it must seem, and
hence not consistent; and it also connects Jehoah with Horus and the wine god Osir-is or Noa'^h or Bacchus. The words Harus and Bus are rendered with like meaning (Isa. I4:i7>
19; Zech. 10:5; Ex. 15:7, &c.), and in the Egyptian worship of the date of these Bible
stories Bes had absorbed the attributes of ATum and Raa and ^Heru-Ur ("Aroer-is") as



210 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the old Sun, while ''Har or "Horus" was the young Sun, the Sun of morning or of Spring;
hence Je-Bus as a town and shrine of the old concept became the Hiero-Solyma or Horus
Solyma of the Greeks, it may seem; and this
would explain, perhaps, the columns Bo-Aaz
and la-Chin placed before the temple, as ''Hun
in Egyptian means "child" or "youth," and
Horus is called ""Hun in the "Sorrows of Isis/'
while the Metternich Stele represents Bes and
Horus apparently as father and son.
21. The connection of Bez or Te-Bus with ^sav appears when it is said that ^sav
"despised" or Ji-Bez his birthright, and when
we find his wife called Bas-Emath, whose father's name, Ael-on, means "strong" and also a "ram," while Math or E-Math suggests "death," though Em-ath may be merely "mother," or "Am-ath," handmaid." Sha-Aul, the second syllable of whose name may be for
"strong" or "ram" was also "despised" or le
Bez-ah by the sons of Beli-Aal, who asked
"What leshuaa this?" not "How shall this
man leshuaa us." (i Sam. 10:27), for the old word Usho-Gal or "ogre" meant to a feeble
people a "saviour," if even in a le-Bez or
"despised" form, for Sha-Aul had been turned
into an Aish A'^har (10:6; 11 .7), Hterally a



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 211
''man behind" or "fierce man/' the Greek and
Egyptian Acher-on or Charon, or perhaps ""Har or ''Horus/' It seems certain that Sha-Aul nor ^sav, any more than Bez or Malech-Areth or Pan or Herakles, is to be considered less
than a demi-god; "saviours'' when with us,
""Her-ah or "fierce" when against us, hence
Aish A-'^Har may be a "fierce man," though in
Egypt every king called himself a ''Har or "Horus." I-Shemaa-El the Kash-eth or "archer"; Nabal the Kesh-ah or "churhsh," whom
David calls ^'Hai or "beast" (rendered "himthat-liveth") ; Sha-Aul and Mordech-ai as de
scendants of Kish, all were sylvan concepts, it
must seem ; that is, Kish-eth or "snarers" ; and
so, when El-Ishaa is conducting the hairy Eli
Jahu to the Seair-ah or "goat-barge," and asks
a gift, he calls El-Ishaa "Kesh-ith to Sheol"
o r "snarer to Hades," rendered "hard to grant"; hence we should take Kish and its
derivatives in an evil sense.
22. Aaz-Azel, to whom the Seair-Aaz or "hairy-goat" was sent at the Atonement, evi
dently represents the rejected deity of the fields,
or the Sun of winter, as the "goat" or "strong"
when Azel or "departed." At the other au
tumn festival (Such-oth), a portion was sent to
Ain Nachon, rendered "nothing-is-prepared"



212 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
(Nehe. 8 :io), but which means the "not erect/'
the ''imperfect/' the ''un-sincere." The two
evil personages are connected by the incident of Auzz-ah, whose name means ''strength" or
"goat/' and who was smitten by the God for touching the Aron at the inn of Nachon (2
Sam. 6:7); and this was notice to David to
leave the Aron or chest at the house of Aobed Edom or "servant of Edom" or ^sav; thus opposing Na-Chon to Auz-ah or Aaz-Azel, the
"erect" to the satyr concept or beast type of
Deity; but David, offended by the death of
Auz-ah, appeased the satyr by leaving the boat
at the dwelling of his servant for three months, perhaps the winter season of Capri-Cornu. And at Such-oth feast the Nehemiah (8:10)
proceeds to tell the people "the joy of Jehoah,
he your Auz" ; a significant statement because
it is probable, very probable, that ^zeraa and
Ne'^hem-Jah introduced the name Jehoah at
this time as the correct name of Deity, which would imply that the word is rather from an
Euphratic language. And this may further
appear if we take the feast lom Chipper, which
happens at nearly the same time, as the same
observance, but by the Canaanites; and that
both are in token of grief at the departure of
the Sun and warmth and vegetation is attested



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 213
if we understand that Aaz-Azel of the one and Ain Na-Chon of the other are the same. The
two pillars before the temple may find here an
explanation of their names, for Bo-Aaz would
represent the old or winter Sun, the "hairy"
Seare or Capri-Corn-u, ^s-Av, A-Tum as the
Sun-set Deity in Egypt, the Greek Pan who was nurse of infant Bakch-os; while la-Chin or Na-Chon, which any Hebraist would un
derstand as the samie word, and meaning the
"erect," hence the risen, finds ""Hun in Egyp
tian meaning "child," "young," with which may be compared the statues at Memphis be
fore the temple of Pata4i called Summer and
Winter (Herod. 2:121).
23. The daily and yearly birth of the Sun
was the source of numerous myths or ideals;
the old or winter Sun being hoary or hairy,
hence horny, the Kron-os of the Greeks (the
Karan or "horn" of Hebrew), and Satur-n-us
of the Latins, called also Latins (from Lateo),
as Lot and Seter in Hebrew both mean "con
cealed," and so the Greek Satyr; the Saturnalia
at Rome when the Sun is in Capri-Corn in the
month Tybi or Tebet of Egyptians and He
brews, which is the Teb-ah or "ark" of Noa'^h
and Mosheh, but particularly the Seair-ah



214 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
which carried off ^sav and EH-Jahu; but see
the note at the end of this chapter.
24. But the Seair-ah out of which Jehoah
addressed Job (38:1) comes nearer to my understanding as the ''great Rua'^h" and "great
Seaare" which were sent by Jehoah to punish
the fugitive Jonah (1:4), and whom they or
it found asleep in the recesses of the Sepin-ah
(v. 5), that is, Spain, or the "hidden,'' or a
"ship" of that far Sun-set land. Rua^'h is also
a Phoenician word, and figures in the myth
ology of that land as the wind-god ;* and in the
Genesis (1:2) as Rua^'h Elohim it rubbed an
opening in the seas, while in the following
Jahvist document Jehoah Elohim is said to be
walking in the garden "to the Rua^'h of the
Sea," as lom means both "sea" and "day,"
and as the guilty pair heard his voice, as Job
did, and as at Pentecost (The Acts, 2:2-4),
we may conclude that "cool of the lom" should
be altered into the sense of terror, as Seaire
also implies, as appears from their hiding in
the tree, "for I crafty," said Adam, since
Aeirom is the Aarum of verse i, and he was not "naked" (v. 7) ; hence the Rua^h of the
Sea and its voice connects with the Seair-ah
*Vahu was the wind-god of the Persians; whence probably Jahu or Jehoah.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 215
or Jonah's ''tempest"; and Adam and Jon-ah became out-casts, as were Job and ^sav and El-Jahu. Shar-u in Chaldean is rendered
''wind," and Shar was doubtless the wind-god, for in their Deluge myth he and Nebo march in front of the thunderer Ramman or Rimmon,
and overwhelm hill and plain ; and if personified
there it is easily seen that it must have been
likewise in Palestine, and also given an aspect
of "terror" or Seaire, hence "hairy" and "goat" as well as "whirlwind." The Greeks personified the North wind as Bore-as, which was a
terror, and at the sam.e time may refer to the
Bar-is or "barge," the Egyptian Bari; and Boreas was certainly depicted with wings and
white hair, and was worshipped. The Egyp
tians depicted the North wind as a goat or ram
wnth four heads, and with two pair of out
spread wings ; while the East wind was of like
head, but with only one, and one pair of similar wings ; reminding us that "Jehoah caused to go the sea in the Rua^h Kad-im Aaz-ah all the
night" (Ex. 14:21), and Kadim Aaz-ah is
"ancient goat" (fem.) as w^ell as "East strong," which seems a remnant of the original myth
of the pass-over of the Sun or his Af or "body"^ in the Seker or ''Hennu barge of the oryx
prows fo^ Bene-Isera-El was then before Ba



2i6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Aal Zephon, which may be Ba-Aal of "the
North/' and is identified by students with the
Greek Typhon, that is, Set the brother-foe of Osiris, but also with the Arab word Tuphan
or ''whirl-wind," and thus connecting with Seaar-ah and Kadim Aaz-ah. The word
Zephan also means "hidden,'' and so does
Sepan, and Jonah took refuge in the recesses of the Sepin-ah ("Spain") or "ship." The
Red Sea was the sea of Sup, or Suph, and Sup
ah is also "tempest" (Job 27:20; Isaiah 17:13,
&c.), but perhaps in its usual sense "to sweep
away," "to carry-off." The Such-oth observance in Autumn was also called A-Sep or A
Seph, for the Sun was then retreating to his
Such-ah or "tabernacle" or "covert," just as
Bene Isera-El and Ja-Aakob were at Such-oth, and Seph or A-Seph means both to "take away," or "withdraw" and the atrium of a
sanctuary; so Jo-Seph or Jo-Sep was the "taken away," and Zephan-ath or "hidden." The ASeph Suph (Num. 11:4), rendered "mixed multitude," is perhaps taken from the Jeremiah
(8:13; also Zeph. 1:2), and as "I will con
sume" implies a destroyer or eater; hence it Te-Av Te-Av-ah or "fell a-lusting" (compare
the Ta-Av-ah or "delight" of Eve, Gen. 3:6),
that is, "desire for flesh" or the Egyptian word



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 217
Af ; which as a monster is thus identified with
the Ae-Reb Rab or ''mixed multitude" (Ex.
12:38) that went up with Bene Isera-El, and which as Ae-Reb seems also taken from the great personages to be cursed in the Jeremiah
(25:20, 24), the Rab or ''mighty-one" of the
Isaiah (19:20), so that A-Seph Suph and Aereb Rab was some powerful creature, some "great Dark" one, which was of the geni or
giant brood; perhaps connected with the body
of Jo-Seph, and certainly with the Sel-Av or
"quails" that went up (Ex. 16:13), which was
clearly not "quails."
25. Seair-ah, as feminine of Seaire, connects with "Esau" or Aes-Av, a name which in Egyptian as Aash-Af would mean "much
flesh," implying both size and voracity. There
is much in favor of the view that "the Adam, the Adam this," which he asked Ja-Aakob to let him seize, was a "man," perhaps a "red man," whom Aes-Av would have eaten had not his brother given bread and lentils instead.
The giantology of all nations is connected with
flesh-eating, and even that of human captives
and, as an aspect of Melach-Areth or the "skinking," to w^hom as Molech the Hebrews offered their children, whom he was supposed to de
vour, Aes-Av asked that he might eat the



2i8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Adam or "man." ''The God'' even directed
the patriarch Aberaham to thus sacrifice his
son, but then spared the youth. So, at the famous Berith or "covenant" of Jehoah and
Bene-Iserael (Ex. 24:11), where "the Elohim
was seen to eat and to drink," it seems to me
indicated from verses 5-6 what his meat and
drink were, or at least that children were sac
rificed to him on this important occasion; but
the stronger similarity of Jehoah and Aes-Av
is that the God of Isra-El also used the Seair
ah or Seaar-ah (Job 38:1 ; Gen. 33:16).*
* Whether the initial letter be a Sin or a Samech this
word is usually rendered "storm," "tempest," "whirlwind," but only "goat" when the Sin is used.



SECTION VII
1. David, like Shimesh-on, was a lion
killer; as both were aspects of the ''skin-king'' or Melech-Aaor. A "skull" or Gol-shaped rock
at Jerttshalem, called Gol-Gatha, made David
also a giant-killer, as David is said to have car
ried the giant's head there before he dispos
sessed the le-Bus-i (i Sam. 17:54), and Gol
Jath of Gath is the Gol-Gatha of the Son of David. 2. Ar-Aun-ah the le-Bus-i has the Ari-eh or "lion" name, and he may be meant for Bes
or le-Bus. It was at his Garon that the Ma
leach of the Ma-She'^h-ith stayed her "destruc
tive" hand, and Se4iet was the lion-goddess, wife of Pata'^h at Memphis, who had a shrine
in Josiah's time at Jerushalem (2 K. 23:13), called Mount of the Ma-She^hith, but there
identified with Aash-Tor-eth ; yet at Pa-Sa'^h,
if blood was on the door-post, "there shall be
no plague to Ma-She'^h-ith in my Hach-oth"
(Ex. 12:13), which latter may refer to her name as Ur-^Hek, the Greek Hek-ate. In the
curious and unintelligible chapter (2 Sam. 24:)



220 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
of David's census, the net result is that he oc
cupies le-Bus, and sets up a Mi-Zeb-a^'h or
''altar" to Jehoah, a reverse of which word is
""Ha-Bez, the lion-god of "Abyssinia," which,
as the Arab words ''Ha-Besch, bears his name.
Scholars have failed to note that the Hebrew
(i Chron. 4:9-10) itself says that the name of
the old deity Ja-Aa-Bez is a reverse of Aa-Zeb
or ''sorrow," or "pain," "toil" (Gen. 3:16, 17),
and the Zeb-a^'h or "altar" may have name from worship of ""Ha-Bez; the "Chi-Bes (or
"like" Bes) in the wine to his shame" (Gen.
49:11), as spoken of Je-Hud-ah the lion, of
whom Tamar made "to Buz" (38:23); and Je-Hud-ah was no doubt Bez or Je-Bus. JaAa-Bez seems in the Chronicle story the same
as Shob-al or la-Bosh of the preceding verse i, which is the la-Bush or "garments" (correctly
"to shame") of Gen. 38:23, as well as the la
Buz or "to shame" of that text; but the
Chronicler makes Shob-al a son instead of the same as le-Hud-ah. This la-Aabez was Ni
Chebad than his brothers, strictly "heavier," usually "hardened" ; but Ai-Chabod the son of Phi-Ne^has, or in Egyptian "the black," shows that Chebod is the ^Haibit or "shadow" of a man, hence Ja-Aa-Bez was "darker," "gloomier" ; confirmed by Ai-Chebod's mother's name.



Bas-t or Se^het of the Egyptian Inscriptions; regarded m this
book as the She'^hath or Ma-She*^hath worshipped at
Jerushalem, rendered the "Destroyer," perhaps Aash
Toreth, perhaps feminine of Bes or Ja-Bez.



222 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Lal-ath, rendered "near-to-be-delivered" ( !)
and Phi-Ne'^has must have priests' food ""Hi or
"raw" (i Sam. 2:15, 22), and he violated the "serving women" or Zabba-oth in the temple of Jehoah Zabba-oth at Shiloh. 3. Saba in Arabic means "lion," but "fox"
in Egyptian, and "man" in Ethiopic, while Zeeb in Hebrew is "wolf," Zebo is "hyena" ; and Bas or Ba^'ha in Egyptian is "panther" or
"leopard" ; hence Sab and its reverse Bes seem
somewhat the same, and doubtless the Latin
Bestia came from this source, while the Greek
Bas-il or "king," a "sheep-skin," is probably
Bes-El, a Syrian word; for the priest Ves
pasian consulted at Elijah's shrine Tacities
calls Basilides, which was perhaps a general
title of them, for Eli-Jah and the Tyrian Melach-Areth or "skin-king" were in close prox
imity. Zabba-oth or "Hosts" is a title given
Jehoah, but the title is not given him in the
Hexateuch, Judges, Job, Ezekiel, or what are
called Solomon's writings; yet Zabba-oth is a
feminine plural, and I suspect "signs," "por
tents," of the constellations, with their beast
figures, gave name to the "serving women" of Zeb or Bez ; hence Aa-Zib-ea or "finger" wrote the ten commandments, as a Syb-il might have done. In Egyptian, however, the hieroglyph



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 223
Seb is a "star," symbol of worship, and the
Jeremiah tells us (44:19) the Jeudean women made cakes to ''the Aa-Zib-ah," not ''worship," who seems to be called Malacheth of Heavens, though Malech-ah would be "queen." Shabbe is the name Pausanias gives the Hebrew sybil,
of whom we doubtless have a memory in the
story of Ai-Zebel (not "Jezebel"), before whom
even the puissant Eli-Jahu fled, to "return" (ti-Shibi), however, from Gile-Aad as Jehue
the chariotier, and destroy the sorceress, for
had not Eli-Jahu gone away in a chariot? 4. From Phrygia, where Sabazius was
son of Kybele, to C^ush or Merve on the upper
Nile, anciently called Saba, we have the footprints of the mighty Seb or Bez ; and the BozRa (not "Byrsa") of Carthage and of Edom, and perhaps Byz-antium near the Euxine, as
well as the titles Sebastos and Basilios of the
Greeks, attest the expanse over which the beastking ruled and the impress of the strength of
this tilanic concept. In Abyssinia he was called ^'Hi-Bes; Egypt perhaps adopted him as Seb
the father of Osiris, and he was also ''Hi and
Bes of their inscriptions. We find his name in
the Sicher-Bas or Acher-Bas of Tyre and Carthage, and probably in the Zabba-oth of
Jews and Phoenicians, as in the Je-Bus of



224 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Jerushalem and the Bu-Bastis of Egypt. In
the classics he is divided into the hairy Her
acles, Hephsestos or Vulcan, Pan, Neptune, the bearded Bacchus, Saturn or Kronos, Hades or
Pluto, &c.
5. The swan-song of Jakob and the 38th
of Genesis clearly indicate that Je-Hud-ah, not
"Judah," was this lion-type of demi-Deity. The
syllable ''ah" at the end of a masculine name
in Hebrew suggests to me the definite article
Ha, and that some concealment is designed. Thus the Greek word Had-es or Ha-Des may be the origin of Ha-Duh-ei, reverse of Je-Hud
ah, and Ho-Du or ''India" is in point (Esth.
1:1). In the oracle of Ja-Aakob his son JeHud-ah is given all the lion names, and even Cha-Bes or "washed" suggests the lion-god
''Ha-Bes of Abyssinia, though also meaning
"like Bes" ; and from this lion "Not shall depart
a staff and a Ma-^Hoekk (the "flail" or "flag
elum" or ''Hekek of Osiris*), from between his
loins till that cometh Shil-oh, and to him a tak
ingt of the peoples" ; and this seems the words
* Wilkinson says it was emblem of dominion, given sometimes by deities to the kings. It seems the "fan" of the
Matthew (3:12). The "staff" or Sheb-At was evidently the
crooked staff, emblem of majesty, often held in the same divine hand as the ^^Hekek. t I-Ka^^h-eth or Ma-Ka^h-oth is rendered "taking" (2 Chron. 19:7), "ware" (Nehe. 10:31).



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 225
of a Hellenised Jew, for Shil-oh is reverse of
ha-Lish or "the Lion"; Lis in Greek; hence
also Hellas and E-Lish-ah (Gen. 10:4; Ezek.
2y:y)\ and the reference is to A-Lesh-Ander or "the Lion-Man" of Macedon; also mentioned in the 38th Genesis as Shel-ah or ha
Lesh the son of Jehudah; but there is possibly
allusion to Mo-Shel or "ruler" (Micah. 5:2),
that is, Shel-it or Sul-tan.
6. It seems incredible that the Hebrews,
an ignorant and imaginative people, should claim not to have had visible and beast symbols
for their several concepts of Deity. The fierce
and persistent attacks on "idols" show that
they had. Besheth or "shameful-thing" had
an altar in every street of Jerushalem five cen
turies after the supposed era of David (Jere.
II :i3; comp. 3:24), and seems connected with that most popular Hebrew name of Deity, Ba
Aal, the "Over" or "In-the-Above"; just as the Egyptian ""Her or "Hor-us" means the "Over" or "Above" ; and this connection would
evidently identify Ba-Aal with Besh or Bes;
but this is done when the hairy Elijah is called
man Ba-Aal, and probably as to Abraham when
Sar-ah is spoken of (Gen. 20:3) as " in the
Aul-ath (or consecration) of Ba-Aal""^; that is,
* "Wife of the man," Aish-eth of the Aish, is in verse 7.
15



226 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
as an Aul-ah or Beth-Ulah, ''virgin," of BaAal; and this accords with the Nesie Elohim
or "exalted of God" that Abram is elsewhere
(Gen. 23:6) called, and with Sar-ah as "princess"; but in Chaldaic Nesh is "lion." The Egyptians made Ba-Aal the same as Set or Nubti or Sute^h (Sadok), and a war-god, and not the same as Bes. The word I-Bush in Chaldaic is rendered "made," "to form," corresponding to the Hebrew and Egyptian word
Pata^'h or Patha^'h in some degree, and to the Hebrew words Aesah and Bera, and hence "Creator" would be the le-Bus of Jerushalem,
at least in the sense of Maleach or "worker";
but, if such was the origin of this name and
concept, the original meaning must have fallen
into the opposite one of "shame," that is, the Chaldaic Bashu or the "bad" ; and there seems little doubt that the name le-Bus or Bez is from the Egyptian word Basu or Ba'^ha, which
means "panther" or "leopard," as he is also called ""Hi in Egyptian, which in Hebrew means
"beast," and hence the ''Hi-El who is said to
have built a "house of the Gods" (Beth-ha
El-i) of Jeri-'^Ho-h, was probably the same as the le-Bus of Jerushalem, and he seems to have
sacrificed his two sons, Abi-Ram and Segub, whose names both mean "exalted" ; and ^'Hi-El



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 227
is probably the same as ''He-Zer-on, the "shut
up beast," father of Ram and Segub (i Chr.
2:9, 21), as well as of the ''dog" Chaleb, who took to him Epherath-ah, whose son was ""Hur
(4:4), the Egyptian word for ''Hor-us."
7. In the later Egyptian, Bes or ""Hi be
comes solar, or rather the old Sun, as he was
in Phoenicia perhaps always identified with
UUam or "Time," expressed also by the word
''Haled, hence ""Huled-ah who gave the Tor-ah
(2 K. 22:14); and the hairy Shimesh-on,
shorn by De-Lil-ah, attests this solar concept
of the lion-god in Judea by the precise names
of the Sun and of the night. In the "Sorrows
of Isis" (Budge, v. 2, p. 27,2), when ''Heru is
"stung" or Pesa^'h, he is said to have been "nursed by a lioness, in the house of Net"
(Neith), and Lel-et the bear-angel, a name of
Ta-Ur, and ""Ha-t and Bes, are asked to pro
tect the limbs of the child; ""Ha-t having the
feminine terminal and sign. In Egyptian,
however, ''Ha or ''Hi means the "fallen," as the Ain Nachon or "not erect" ("nothing is
prepared!") of the Jewish feast Such-oth
(Nehe. 8:10) ; but it cannot be certain that the
Bacchic shout Hollol-u-Xai* (Plutarch^s El
* Hollol-u-Xai, Bacchse, 24, 688, is probably Hallel-u^Hai in Hebrew.



228 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
lel-u-Jou at the 0-Sochaphoria) alludes to ""Hai
or Bes unless Hallel refers to Bacchus as the grape month Elul might indicate, in which case
the Hebrew Hallel-u-Jah or "Hallel and Jah"
must refer to the younger and to the older con
cepts of Deity, such as (Dan. 7:13) the Athik of Days and Che-Bar man, or father and son;
but Ain Nachon or ''Hi as the ''fallen" express the Hebrew word Nephil-im (Gen. 6:4; Num. 13 -33) J sons of Aa-Nak, the Anunak-i or Earth genii of the Chaldeans ; but in an Egyp
tian hymn to the Sun it is said "O thou who art Raa when thou risest and Tem when thou
settest * * who traveleth across the sky
'^ * the serpent-fiend Nak hath fallen and
his two arms are cut off," &c. ; and so it may be that Aa-Nak and Ain Nachou are the same,
and that Nak was the Egyptian proto-type of
them ; nor is it amiss to say that the usual name
for the great serpent foe of Raa is Aapep,
meaning ''giant," and that Nephil-im is often
rendered "giants."
8. It would thus seem that the ogres of
"darkness" or "night," the respective Egyptian
words for which are Ne'^has and Kek or Kora'^h,
give us the Hebrew word Na'^hash or "serpent," "enchanter," "bronze," and the Greek word Gorg-on; as Kek may be Gog; and so



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 229
Kora""!! is the rebel against Mosheh, and son of
I-Za'^har or 'Svhite" (Ex. 6:21), while EH
Shaa is called Kora'^h by the wicked children as
perhaps meaning "black" and not ''bald-head."
The overthrow of the Titans as classic story
seems a tradition common to other peoples,
and it is probable that the Na^'hash who was
condemned to crawl on his belly for deceiving
Adam and ""Hav-ah was a great dark ogre, hence is said to be "most high" or Aa-Rum
("piled-up," Ex. 15:8) "from all the ^Hai-eth"
or "beast-like" of the Sid-ah; for there were
men of the Sid-ah like the red and hairy AeSav, twin son of Rebek-ah, perhaps reverse of ha-Keber or "the tomb." Aa-Rmii is usually rendered "crafty" or "naked," and so Adam
and ""Hav-ah, after eating of the tree to "make
wise" or Sachil, found they were Aei-Rum or
"crafty," hence could make girdles; so that
"crafty" or "wise" is a double yet correct ren
dering of Aa-Rom as applied to the Na'^hash,
and which would accord with his name as "the
diviner" (Gen. 44:5, 15, &c.), also "sorcerer,"
"enchanter." Na'^hash is thus a Pe-Rom-Theos or "Prometheus," which in Egyptian would be Pe-Rom-Ta or Pe-Rom-Da, "Heaven-man
giver," as Ta or Da is "to give," and hence the Greek The-os and the Latin De-us, and Pe



230 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Rom is ''Heaven-man" or "the man" ; for
Na'^hash had also taught mankind and suffered
for it. He was Arur or ''cursed" from all the
Beham-ah or "beast-kind" and from all the
''Hai-eth or "beast-like" ; and this accords with
the statement the priests of Pata^i made to
Herodotus (2:142-144) that no deity had as
sumed the form of man within 11,340 years,
during which time there had been a Pi-Rom-is
who was high-priest for each generation, and that Pi-Rom-is in Greek means "a noble and good man." So, Ram, Me-Rom, and their
variations in Hebrew, mean "high," "lofty," "elevated" ; hence Aa-Meram or "Most-High" was father of Mosheh and also of Jesus (Luke
1*32' 35) J as, indeed, Abram in Egyptian, if
Aab-Ram, would mean "priest-high" or "priest
man." Na'^hash was thus an Aa-Rum, precisely the same as Aa-Me-Ram, as Hebrew
forms are put, and the word at least seems to
mean one elevated by occult wisdom; so, the
Mattah or "staff" of Mosheh is changed into
a Na'^hash, while that of Aharon is changed
into a Thanin (Ex. 4:3; 7:9), which latter is
Greek Py-Thon, no doubt, while both seem
connected Avith Ur-'^Hek the serpent-symbol in
Egypt, translated "mighty-enchanter"; which



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 231
in their Hades was used to open the mouth of
the dead. 9. The Sachil or ''make-wise" probably
connects with E-Sachil-Api-os or ^sculapios, who in Phoenicia was recognized as one of the Kaber-i, and whose resemblance to Mosheh has
been often remarked. The fate of Na'^hash is very like that assigned to Nebuchadnezzar
(Dan. 4:33), whom a decree of Ailla-Ie or
''Most-Hight/' perhaps Ilu-Ea or the god Ea, drove from among men to be as a beast of the
field, &c. ; yet, like la-Bez, the Babel King was
restored and ''excellent grandeur added to him" (v. 36) when he acknowledged the King
of Heaven. The Na'^hash, who long figured
in Jewish as now in Christian theology, was
not pardoned, but allowed still to Shuph or
''bruise" the seed of the woman; Shuph or
Shephiph-on "adder" (Gen. 49:17) being the
"horned-viper" or ''Hefi of Egypt,* and the
woman was also allowed to Shuph ; that is, both became as the Kereastes, which is very ven
omous, and lies in the dust or sand of the
desert, very covertly; hence the indignant
Adam thereafter called the woman ^'Hav-ah,
* This was the opinion of Jerome, Gesenius says. The word Shuph, however, is rather the Egyptian ^Hef, "adversary."



232 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
which is precisely consonant with the Egyp
tian word ''Hefi; nor is there any instance
where the particular form of her name is used
for "Hai or '^Hieh, ''life," ''living/' or their
variants. The ''snake-players" of Egypt are
still called ""Haiv-ee.
lo. The opening verses of 6th Genesis
seem to class the Nephilim with the sons of "the Elohim" and with the Gibbor-im or "mighty-men." The Gibbor-'^Hail or "mighty
man of valor," such as Sha-Aul, Boaaz, le
Petha^'h, Gide-Aon, &c., were doubtless the
same as the Gibbors of the Genesis text, as
''Hail probably means (Ex. 15:14) "frightful,"
"suffering," or some unusual or unsocial con
dition, perhaps connecting with the Egyptian
word ^Hel or ^Her, "fallen," "under"; yet in the Copto-Greek this word appears as Achare or Chare, and so we must have Char-on and Acher-on, perhaps Chir-on the teacher of Achilles, in which case the Egyptian word may
be the Hebrew word A'^har or A^'har-on, "be
hind," "last," and the Chaldaic "west" or
Acharru, so that ''Hail can only connect with
the Egyptian word on the postulate of a dif
ference of idiom of speech, made plausible by
the letters L and R being the same in Egyp
tian.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 233
11. The "^Hail went with Sha-Aul ( i Sam.
10:26), as against the sons of BeHa-Aal, and
are described as "whom smote God in their
heart," as he ''smote" (6:9) the Phihstines
with tumors. Joab, a violent man, was chief
of the ''Hail (2 Sam. 24:2). Rendered ''host,"
^'Hail becomes the same as Zaba or "host,"
"server," a word probably from the Egyptian word Zebau or Sebau, by which name w^as
called a class or order of fiends or evil ones,
so that Jehoah Zaba-oth may mean that he was
master of wicked spirits; yet Sebau w^as also
in Egypt a name of the great serpent who per
sonified the night, the same as Aa-Pep and Nak and Sata. In Egyptian, however, ''Haut
or ''Haud meant a "general" or "leader," and Gibbor ''Hail in Hebrew may mean "mighty
w^arrior" or "great leader." But Aesh-eth
^Hail, applied to Ruth (3:11), could not mean "w^oman warrior" if she was an ordinary mortal, though "bold woman" may answer. 12. The Chaldeans had two known bands of arch-angels or arch-demons, those of the
sky, called Igig-i, and those of the earth, called
Anunak-i. It is probable that these latter
gave name to Aanak in the hills of Judea, and
to the giant brood. From I-Gig w^e evidently have A-Gag the Aam-Alek who was cut-in



234 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
pieces before Jehoah by Shemu-El; Aam-Alek being Rosh-eth, "first/' "tallest," of nations (Num. 24:20), grandson of Ae-Sav; and the stature of Agag was proverbial (Num. 24:7),
while Aam-Alek is "people of Aaluk,'' who ate human flesh, and so the daughters of the Aaluk
ah (Prov. 30:15) were Ghouls. Aog of Bashan
was one of these I-Gigg-i, as was probably
Haig the national deity of the Armenians, prob
ably alluded to as Gog in the 38th and 39th
Ezekiel. Agee the Rar-i or "cursed" (2 Sam. 23:11) was father of one of David's Gibbors
who fought singly against Philistines when they assembled "to ''Hai-Jah," who seems the
"beast-god" (Gen. 37:20), not "into a troop,"
since he was in a field of lentils, food of hairy
Ae-Sav (Gen. 25 :34). But in the famous story
of Eseter or Ishtar we find the arch-enemy of Mordech-ai or Marduk to be Haman the A
Gag-i, that is, an I-Gig-i or arch-angel or -demon, whose name means "many" or "multitude"; so the- Mark (5:1-20) and Luke (8: 27-39) introduce Haman under the name Legion; but these gospels as well as the Esther
get the name from the Ezekiel (39:11-16); the Ezekiel speaking of giving Gog or Hamon
Gog a tomb "in Israel, the valley of the Aaberaim," or "Hebrews"; and so the gospel demon



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 235
dwelt in the tombs; and Haman was son of
the Med-atha or man of "stature'' (Num. 13:
32 ) , born at Gath to the Rapha ( i Chron. 20
6; also 11:23), such as Gol-Iath, and Gol or
Gal in Chaldaic means ''great" ; while the contest between Mordech-ai and Haman the AGag-i seems the same as the Armenian tradition of the war between Bel Marduk and Haigh, and that of Horus and Set, as in Egyptian the word Set means also "mountain." The I-Gig-i give name to the Greek Gig-ans or
"giants," it must seem, but it may also be a
contracted form of Gilgal where A-Gag was
hewn in pieces, for Gilgal was a resort of the giant Sha-Aul or Ushu-Gal, who was son of Kish, as Mordech-ai descended from Kish, and they are apparently the same; and Agag's great heighth required his dismemberment just as
the gallows of fifty cubits, "in the house of Haman," was required to hang either Mor
dech-ai or Haman the Agagi.
13. The size of Aog of Bash-an is set
forth (Deut. 3:11), and we are told that he was
the last of the Repha-im; but the letter Ain
which begins his name is often sounded like
our gh, and hence there is practically no difference of name between Aog and the Gog of
the Ezekiel, who is here an expected invader,



236 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
to be buried, and all the Hamon, in the valley
of the Hebrews (Ezek. 39:11), or 'Valley of
the passers-through'' ; but the short A in Ader
Ai, where Aog was defeated, scarcely allows
us to identify it with the Gadar-enes* of Mat
thew's (8:28) account, though the latter was the same country Bash-an or ''shame," the
Chaldaic Besh or "bad," equivalent to the
Shave or "in-vain" to whom the name of Jehoah was not to be uttered. A^'ha-Shave-Rosh,
to whom Eseter dared to go at the appeal of Marduk, reminds one of the title given Gog as
Nesie Rosh or "lofty-head" of Meshech ("tall,"
Isaiah 18:2, 11) and Tubal ("lustful," Lev.
18:23), which latter word recalls the conduct
of these giants, for Haman is said to Nephel
on the couch of Eseter with apparent intent to
Che-Bosh her (Esth. 7:8); while it must be
noted that Hamun in Perisian means "expan
sive," hence "large," and his "fall" or Nephel
recalls the Nephil-im of Gen. 6, when these
demi-gods took wives of whom they chose.
The word is written Nophel in this case of Haman, as if Noph-El or "Memphis-God"
(Noph. Isaiah 19:13, &c.), the grotesque Pa
ta^'h or "Vulcan/" or his sons the Kabir-i
* The cure of Legion occurs in the country of the Gerasenes or "cast-outs" according to the Mark and the Luke.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 237
(Herod. 3:37), which latter word may be Gibbor-i, though in Hebrew Kabur-i would be "tombs."
14. The Egyptian word Kera^'h or ''night/' whence the Greek Gorg-on, may connect with the Chaldean I-Gig, the Hebrew A-Gag and Gog, for, as Perseus or Pe-'Orus (''the Horus" or "light") overthrew the Gorg-on, so Mor
dech-ai, son of Ja-Air or "light," overthrew
the A-Gog Haman; and Jehoah will destroy Gog, and his Hamort, and "bury" or Keber them, while Jesus alone cures the demoniac
Legion when he comes out of the Keber-i; a man so strong he could not be bound with
chains; but Legion was only restored to his right mind after he had fallen down and wor
shipped Jesus; as, likewise, Nebuchadnezzar's understanding returned and excellent Rab was added to him ; and the limits of Ja-Abez were Reb-itha, as the bedstead of Aog was at Rabb
ah in Aa-Mon. Ja-Air, "light," father of
Mordech-Ai, is also the name of the chief for whom Bashan or land of Repha-im (Deut. 3:
13-15) was later called, so that Ja-Air was
evidently a giant as well as a ruler (Judges
10:3-5), buried in Kam-on; and it is barely a
coincidence that the story of Ja-Air-us at once follows in the Mark and Luke the cure of Le



238 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
gion, and that ''Maiden, Kumi," is said to his
dead daughter, while the old Ja-Air as a Gile
Aad-i, "great-multitude" or "assembly," is as Aad-uth rendered "synagogue" in the Greek;
but, if not a coincidence, the i-Keber or "bur
ial" in Kam-on or "arise" of Ja-Aer the Gile
Aadi-i who as "light" succeeded to the land of
the Repha-im, and had the thirty ""Havv-oth or
"habitations" (a Chaldaic word for "living"
as against Repha-im or "dead," must have sug
gested the name Jair-us, if not the story;* to which must be added that Talitha is "maiden"
only in Syriac, that Tal-ah is "to suspend" in Hebrew, and Haman was Talah or "sus
pended" on the tree, also "crucified," and
neither was dead if Tal-itha comes from Talah; nor was A-Besh-Alom when he was Talah (2 Sam. 18:14), for Haman as an I-Gig or arch-demon perhaps appears yearly in the month Adar or March to oppose the Pur or
"coming-forth" of vegetation or the Sun, or
the Pur-ath, as in Egyptian theology the Per-t or "coming-forth" by daylight is the hope of the deceased in Amen-ti, and they are beset by demons who oppose this. Pa-Sa^'h commemor
* la-Aer had thirty sons who rode upon thirty Air-im and had thirty Air-im, which is evidently a play on his name,
though the A is different (Judges 10:4). Compare, Aira the Jair-i, priest of David (2 Sam. 20:26).



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 239
ates the same, as it seems the "passage" of the IsraeH through the Ma-Debar or "from
speech," when they fight at Reph-Id-im or
''giant-hands" with Midi-an or men of "stature," with Aa-Nak with Aam-Alek, with Aog, &c., for it was the land of Tal-Aob-oth (Hosea. 13:4-5) or "tormenting-demons"*; these Aoboth seeming a refuge, however, from the
Seraps or serpents of Serap-is (Num. 21 :6
10), and perhaps a derisive epithet for the Aab
i, that class of the Egyptian priesthood who purified with water ; hence Aob is also Hebrew
for "water-skin"; and so Ka-Sem or "witchcraft" may be the Sem or highest order of
Egyptian priesthood as "bull-tpriest," perhaps
"ghost-prophet."
15. The ''Haron or "fierce" anger of Jehoah was permanent against the giants. He rejected Sha-Aul for not destroying Aam-Alek or A-Gag and his cattle as well as the women
and children. The very offspring, the suck
lings, of this race of beings, were to be exter
*Tele-Aah is "trouble" (Ex. 18:8; Num. 20:14); Aah
being the cry of grief (Josh. 7 :7) ; and Aob-oth is the usual
"familiar-spirits" or sorcerers, and in this case the word is
plural feminine of Aob (I Sam. 28:7), though Ba-Aal-eth Aob of Ain-Dor was a woman. ^^
tKa is "bull;" also in Egyptian Ka meant the "ghost
of a person, his "double," which usually dwelt in his tomb if
food was placed there; so Ka-Sem may refer to the spiritual
power of the Sem or "prophet" who wore the panther skin.



240 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
minated by the edge of the sword as well as at one time by a deluge of water. That they are
alleged to be giants, in order to heighten the
achievements of the fathers in the eyes of posterity, everywhere appears. The most com
mon enemy, the Peli-Sheth-im or 'Thilistines,''
perhaps are ''wonderful-drinkers" or "wonder
ful clamorors,'' and same as the Beni-Shath (Num. 24:17), which name might be so understood by Hebrews even if as I believe the word Pe-Le-Shet-au or ''the Reshtau," that is,
"the mouth (Re) of Set'' or the Desert (hence the Greek form Pe-Lu-Si-on as the name of
the border city Sin"^) w^as the origin of the
name Pe-Le-Shet or Philistine ; and this though the Leshet-au or Resht-au was religiously the
south door of Na-Rad-f ("nothing-growethit")t wherein was the sanctuary of Osiris as
typefied at Suten-'^Henen, called by the Greeks
city of Herakles; which "wilderness" was also called Na-Rer-Rud-f or "wandering in the Na
* Sin is the Egyptian city of Aam or "eater," and Pe
Lu-Si-um or "the door of passage" would perhaps justify the classic name, as it was at the entrance to the Desert of Sin or Sin-ai. Since connecting the words Pelusium and Peleshet or "Philistine," as above, I find that Plutarch says
that the only son of Melkarth and Astarte, who came back
with Isis from Byblos with the dead body of Osiris, bore
the name Palaestin-us or Pelusius, and his death was much
mourned, Isis building Pelusium to his memory.
t Compare Aa-Rad (Numb. 21 :1) on the edge of the Wilderness, and Pa-Rad-ise.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 241
Rud" or desert, for Osiris seems to have also
fled to the Wilderness or solitude.
16. Set or the ''deserf was the foe as well
as brother of Osiris, perhaps as sterility and
productiveness are antithetic; Osiris in such
case typefying Egypt, the granary of the known world, for his most usual name was Un
Nepher or ''visible Good," but possibly the
Nepil or "fallen'' or "giant,'' as he was asso
ciated closely with the constellation Orion, or
(as the Egyptians called it) Sa'^h, the supposed Hebrew Chesil, which word means "giant" in
Arabic. And Set or Sute^h, a rejected term
for Deity in the later Egyptian theology, was the same as the Hebrew Ba-Aal as understood
in Egypt, at least in some of his phases, for the
two have in the inscriptions the same sign of
the Sha or fox-hybrid (Budge. "Gods of the Egyptians") ; so, in Hebrew, the word Set in its several forms has a sinister meaning, such
as "entice" (Deut. 13:7; i K. 21:25), as Jehoah or Sat-an "moved" or le-Seth David (2 Sam. 24:1 ; i Chron. 21 :i) to what turned out
to be a frightful crime; and in this strange
story we find Jehoah and Set or Sat-an are the
same, and foes of Isera-El; while Ai-Zebel
"stirred-up" or the Sat-ah her husband, who worshipped Ba-Aal and went after Gilul-im,



242 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
and the Sat-ah seems to indicate her as a female Set or Sat-an. The personaUty of Ba-Aal un
der that name is nowhere described in Hebrew
writings, though the Jahvist account of the
contest of EH-Jahu with the priests of Ba-Aal
indicates that he was ''lame," for his priests
"limped" or Pa-Se'^h about the altar; and that he was Set may appear when it is said EHJahu "i-Rapha the altar of Jehoah the Harus"
(i K. 18:30), for Horus is here identified with Jehoah, and Horus was in Egyptian myth the antagonist and destroyer of Set.
17. Set as Nubti was father of JereboAam, perhaps the Egyptian ''Eater-of-Ur-Ab"
or the ''Still-Heart," a name of Osiris, and this
great foe of Jehoah was not only a Gibbor ''Hail but an Aash-ah Maleach-ah, rendered
"industrious," as if Aasah or "maker," yet Aashe-ah is probably the constellation Aash or Great-Bear (Job 9:9), the Arab Na-Aash, which word also means "to carry" or a "wagon" in that tongue; while as ^Hep-Esh or
"thigh," symbol of power, this constellation in Egyptian was called the bull Me-Se^h-et of
Set,* in one star of which he dwelt, as against
the southern constellation Sa'^h or "Orion" of Osiris ; which Se^het or Me-Se^h-et is probably
* Budge, ''Gods of the Egyptians." ,



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 243
the ''destroyer" or Ma-She'^h-ith (Ex. 12:23, &c.), whose altar gave name to the mountain at Jerushalem where she seems identified with Aashe-Tor-et, that is probably Ta-Ur, whose appearance as a sow or hippotamus or bear
would seem to confirm this view, especially as
she it was who fettered this evil constellation,
and who is figured with a chain about its leg
when it is depicted as a bear; yet in this case the name Ishtar of the Chaldeans, As-Tarte as
the Greeks called the Tyrian goddess, and the
Jewish Ase-Ter or ''Esther," would evidently connect with Ta-Ur of Egypt, and the watch
ful constellation that never sets; thus includ
ing Mi-Zeph-ah the daughter of "Jepthah" or
le-Pata'^h in the sense of "watcher" ; hence the meaning of Sether as "hidden" would yield to
that of Ta-Ur or "the Mighty," and to the Arab word Aash-ah or "hairy," "shaggy," like Aes-av or "Esau" who went to Seair-ah or the "hairy"-goddess upon the advent of Isera-El at Pe-Nu-El; which word "Pe-Na" in Egyptian means perhaps "the not"-god, as Hebrew Pen
or "lest," "that not," and is applied to ^sav
as superceded; so that Aashe-Tor-et or As
Tar-te is properly wife of Melek-Areth or the
"skin-king," as perhaps of Aog (Deut. 1:4);
while Jerebo-Aam built Pe-Nu-El as indicative



244 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
of his relation to the no-god or beast-types of
Deity; yet his Aa-Gela-i or "calves" also means "wains'' or "wagons/' as the Arab word Na
Aash does, and they doubtless refer to the bull Mese^h-et of Set, as Meshech in Hebrew means "to-draw-along," also "tall" as drawn-out. It was a new "cart" or Ae-Gal-ah in which the Peli-Shet-im sent back the Aron of Jehoah,
drawn by two Par-oth or "cows," and when this "cart" came into the field of Jehoshue-Aa of the
house of the Shemesh (not "Shem-ite") or the "Sun" both cart and cows were sacrificed to Jehoah; but when David brought the Aron from the Ba-Aal-i of Jehudah he only sacrificed
a bull and a calf ; yet it must be noted that this
movement of the shrine was after he had de
feated the Peli-Shet-im.
1 8. The word Aam in Hebrew means
"people," while in Egyptian Aam is "eater," and the Aa-Aam were the nomads of the Set
or "desert," so that if the name Jerebo-Aam is
Egyptian the affinity with Set is apparent, and Aam or Pelu-Si-um and the Peli-Shet-im would
also connect. The fact, too, that Jerebo-Aam founded Shechem, a word which in Hebrew
means "shoulder," and Sut is "shoulder" in
Egyptian, seems to identify him with the god
Set; a point strengthened by the fact that in



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 245
Egyptian Se^hem means "power," ''force"* but at Se^hem (Leto-polis) in Egypt was de
posited the "shoulder" of Osiris, which was called Maa-^Hak (a word which sounds somewhat as Ma-Gog). ""Ham-Or, father of the Shecham who ravished Din-ah, bath-Jakob means "Ass" in Hebrew, a beast in Egypt
associated in places with the cultus of Set, but in Egyptian the words ""Ham-Ur mean the "great Egyptian." 19. Gide-Aon, a Gibbor ''Hail was son of lo-Esh or "fire," Abi the Ae-Zera-i or "father
of the defenders," and dwelt in Aa-Per-ah, which means a "gazelle," for in Egypt the oryx
was sacred to Set, and is depicted on the brow of the foreign (Syrian) god Reshep, as its head also is the prow of the ""Hennu or Seker
boat which encloses and carries off Osiris, as
the Seair-ah or "goat-barge" carries off Elijah, and in which dwelt Ae-Sav. Gide-Aon is found w^orking with wheat "in Gath," rendered "wine-press," but his concubine was in Shechem, where the name of Deity was Ba-Aal Berith, who was perhaps the same as lerub-Ba
Aal (if we reverse le-Rub to Bur-ei), and this
* The word Shechem in Hebrew is often read "early," as "he arose Shechem," but so frequent is the phrase that I suggest the Egyptian sense, and would read he arose "strengthened" or "refreshed."



246 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
may be the correct form of Jerebo-Aam who
built Shechem; yet the camp where Jerub-BaAal mustered to fight Mid-Ian and Aam-Alek was the fountain or eye of ""Harod, and he
pursued them to the ascent of the ""Heres,
capturing the two kings ''and all the camp of
the ""Harid," which seem certainly allusions to
Horus and '^Har-pa-'^Herad or ''Harpocrates";
for Mid-Ian may be "giant-oppressor" or "wine-giant," as if from the same word as ha
Med-atha the father of Haman, coupled with
Iain or Jain "heat," boiling," hence "wine,"
"rage," "oppression." In all mentions of the
word Mid-Ian it is in the singular, and so mostly is Aam-Alek, as if they were individ
uals. "Wine" is A-Rep in Egyptian, and so we have the classic P-Riap-us or "the Wine"god, and perhaps To-Rophon-ius, &c. ; but the
Greeks derived their word Oin-os evidently
from the Phoenicians. But the land of Midian was that to which Mosheh fled, not to
meditate as in case of others who wxnt into the "Wilderness," but because he was a murderer who feared the penalty of his crime; and yet
the name Midi-An or "no speech" is in Egyp
tian the equivalent of Ma-Debar or "from
speech" in Hebrew, which is rendered "Wilderness" ; the Egyptian words Med-et or "word"



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 247
and Na or An or "not" or "no" constituting the former name. And that Midian means a
solitude finds support in the fact that the
synoptic gospels all say Jesus went into the Wilderness; the original and simple form of
this statement being that of the Mark (1:12
13) ; for the gospels seem resolved to rank
Jesus with Mosheh. Still, the Hebrew word Med-ah or "tall" readily suggests a giant or "tempter" who was supposed to inhabit such
localities ; while, on the other hand, during the
oppression of Midi-Ian we find Gide-Aon in the Gath or "wine-press," and he slew Aoreb or the "raven" on his rock and slew Zeeb or the
"wolf" at the Jakeb or "wine-press," &c. ; so that we may thus connect Midi-Ian with Repa
im. In this connection we may observe that
Jether the eldest son of Gide-Aon refused to
kill the two princes of Midian, and this story may have been known to the writer of the Ex
odus story since the name Jether-o is given to
the priest of Midian.
20. Rapa or Rapha (the Hebrew P and Ph are the same letter) is rendered "giant,"
"healer," "dead." We should probably under
stand "genii," "satyrs," "goblins," of great
size, or even "ghosts" (Job 26:5; Ps. 88:10, &c.); but the Latin word Rapere, whence



248 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
"rape," seems from the Egyptian A-Rep or "wine," suggesting drunken violence, and the P-Riapus of Lampasakos seems from the same source. The Egyptian dead were to encounter
in the Dua-t many evil beings; so, in She-01
(Isaiah 14:9), the Egyptian She-Ur or "great
lake" or "abyss," when Nebuchadnezzar reaches there, the Repha-im and the Aa-Tud-i (comp.
Isaiah i :ii) awake to meet him, which "chief
ones" are the lustful "he-goats" of Jakob's
dream (Gen. 31:10, 12), evidently deriving,
like Dad or "David," their name from the Osiris ram of Taddu or Daddu ("Mendes") in Egypt, and worshipped under the name
Seair-im by the Israelites (Lev. 17:7; 2 Chr.
II :i5) ; and this "ram" or Ba must have given
name to the old Bo-Aaz aspect of Deity at
Beth Le'^hem, for Aaz is "goat" in Hebrew, and
hence Ruth tempted his lascivious disposition
by getting under his Chanep or "wing" while
he was drunk, for, like Sha-Aul, he was
winged. The best known of these Seair-im or
Sat3^rs w^as ^^s-Av (Gen. 36:20, &c.), but his
grandson Aam-Alek was most hated (Ex. 17:
16), though "people w^io suck blood" (as Aam
Alek means) were properly identified with
^s-Av's desire to eat a "red man" or "blood



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 249
of the man," the Adam of the Adam (Gen. 25
30). 21. If Rapha or Rapa is not from the Egyptian word Arep or 'Svine," as P-Riap-us evidently is, we might find the Egyptian words
Ur-Af or ''great-flesh" converted into Rapha, since ^s-Av or ''Esau" seems "much-flesh" in Egyptian; and this Egyptian word Aes or Aash, "much," "many," means Haman or Amon in Hebrew, and he was an A-Gag-i or Aam-Alek-i; but Jesus calls him Ma-Amon, and he is "many" or Legion in the Mark and Luke. But Af or "flesh" seems the Ta-Av-ah
or desire for flesh of the Hebrew (Num. 11 14,
34), "flesh" to the eyes (Gen. 3:6) ; but seems
the same as their word Gav-ah or Gevi-ah, the "body" (i Sam. 31:10); and in Egyptian we have Af-Raa, Af-Tem, Af-Asar, for the Sun when it had passed into the Duat or Hades was
called Af as being mere "body" or "flesh," as
if its light was its soul or life; and so Aberaham and others Gav-aa or "gave-up-the-ghost"
or body, while the Gevi-eth or "body" of Sha
Aul is also called (i Chr. 10:12) Guph-ath.
As we have Rapha-im as "dead," "giants,"
"healers," we may reasonably infer that the word comes from the Egyptian words Ur-Af
or "mighty-body," "great-flesh." Bene Isera



250 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
El in the Ma-Debar necessarily met these giant
spirits. Before reaching the sacred Sin-ai they
battled with Aam-Alek at Reph-Id-im. 22. Reph-Id-im probably means "gianthands'' or "healing-hands" or "dead-hands/"
as either would fit the events. Mosheh, seated,
the sceptre of Jehoah in his hands, acted like an umpire. His hands were Chebed, perhaps shadowy or spectral, the Egyptian ^Haibit ; and when his hands went up Isera-El Gebar or "mighty-man," when his hands rested AamAlek was Gebar; but Aharon and ""Hur they ta-Mech or "smote" the lad-i of Mosheh, making them Anum-ah or "true" till the Sun went
in or came in, though Amun is a suggestive word here. The demon and his Aam-i were "prostrated" or la-^'Helesh by Jehoshuaa at the
mouth of the ''Horeb, which ^'Horeb may mean "sword" or "drouth" or the mountain of that
name. The place is then by Mosheh called
Jehoah Nis-i, at the same time warning "that a lad on the Ches of Jah; war to Jehoah by^ Aam-Alek from age to age"; a phrase some
what sybilic, and palpably mis-rendered in our
usual versions. Nis is usually rendered "to
tempt," but is "throne" in Egyptian, as Nez
in Arabic, and probably corresponds with Ches
or "throne," or mav be the same, as the initial



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 251
letters are very similar. There is little excuse
for rendering Ches ''hath sworn/' the Septua
gint having it "concealed," while the Samaritan
and Peshitto have it ''throne." The reading
seems to imply that Jehoah was ''tempted" to
decide favorably to Aan-Alek, whose hand is
constantly ready to avenge this adverse de
cision. But the perpetual hostility here declared between Jehoah and Aam-Alek is remarkable in view of the "Cursed be Haman" still uttered at the observance of Pur-im, for he was an Agag-i, and Agag and Aam-Alek seem much the same, being Repha-im or genii
or hairy satyrs; Mide-an or Med-ath or "tall
of stature." In the Egyptian "Book of the Dead," chapter 165, one in the Duat or Unseen World addresses the god Amen, "Hidden (Amen) is your name, El-Ta-Sashaka, and I have made for you a skin; your name is BaIle-Kai, your name is Maalek-Atha" ; and,
whether this indicates Aam-Alek or the "skin
king" Malach-Aareth, the difference is small, as Malach-Aareth is surely ^sav the grandfather of Aam-Alek ; yet it will be observed that
the Egyptian god Amen, who we are told in their inscriptions was worshipped in Palestine,
seems here to be assimilated with the hairy
concepts of Deity there; so that it is possible



252 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
that Amen is represented by Haman. 'Tn the
times approaching the Ptolemaic period," says Budge, "the name Amen appears to have been
connected with the root Men, to ''abide," to be "permanent"; and, as this was about the
period when the historic portions of the Jew
ish Scriptures were written, we may see why Shemu-El was to be a Na-Amon priest and to have a Na-Amon house (i Sam. 2:35), and after death he rises from the ground, "he Atah Me-Ail" or "embalm robe"; as David is
also to have a house of Na-Amen (25 128), for David was A-Demon-i (16:12) as the "red" ^sav was, probably a demon or geni; while No-Anion (Nahum 3:8) was Nu-Amen or "City of Amen," Thebes in Egypt; but even one of David's sons was Amen-on, and the
sister he ravished was Ta-Mar, a name of
Egypt. 27,. Aamal, however, means a "toiler" in a sorrowful sense, like the Aa-Zeb with which Adam was condemned, reversed to la-Bez (i
Chr. 4:9-10), in whom I recognize Je-Bus or
Bes; and Ako is "goat" or "roe-buck" in Arabic ; so we may have Aamal-Ek as an aspect
of the Satyr or Seair-Aaz, the Aa-Thud or
"he-goat," a phase of Osiris at Taddu or
Daddu, which city the Greeks called Mendes.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 253
In any case, the last we hear of this demon is
that Repha-Jah, Auzi-El, &c., in the days of King Hezekiah, went to Mount Seair "and
smote the remnant of the escapsed to Aama
lek" (i Chr. 4:42-43), and Rephi and Auz
('"strong" or "goat'') are suggestive of the old
legend.
24. This fight at Rep-Id-im is closely pre
ceded by the sweetening of water at Mar-ah, where Jehoah Nis-ah the people, and said "I
Jehoah Rophe thee'' (Ex. 15 '.21-26) ; following
which is the thirst at Repi-Id-im, when Mosh
eh smote the rock ''Horeb, calling the place Mas-ah upon their Nas-eth or "tempting" Jehoah, saying "The being of Jehoah in our
midst or not" (17:1-7); apparently two ver
sions of the same incident, though the later
book Numbers (20:7-13) locates the rock story at Kadesh. Between the two versions is found the account of the bread from Heaven, preceded by the Chebod of Jehoah ; this also being
a gift in order that he might A-Nas the people
(Ex. 16:4). It was the repeated Lon or Lun,
rendered "murmur," of the people that in
voked this Nis-i or Nas, and it might seem that in the Ma-Debar or "from Speech" they were
required to be silent, and so the Egyptians in
the After- World could only speak when the



254 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
mouth was opened with the serpent wand, which was perhaps the Serap elevated by Mosheh on a Nas; Nas in Egyptian meaning
''tongue" as well as ''throne" ; so that the Lon or "murmur" seems reproved by Jehoah or Mosheh by showing that he alone had the power of Nas-ah or "tongue." But this inter
pretation could not well apply to the prostration
of Aam-Alek unless Jehoah Nis-i means that Jehoah "spoke" somewhat against him; in which case "an lad on the Nesh," instead of
Ches, may be "a hand on the man" of Jah, for A-Nesh or "man" and the Coptic word Nesh or "oath" (both from the Egyptian word Ane^h or "life," "living," may have induced
the curious substitution of "hath sworn" in
the English versions, for in this oracular passage there were hands on the hands of Mosheh as the man of Jah, whose hands were Rape or
"dead" or "healing" or "gigantic." The Lon or "murmur," however, seems to connect with
the idea of "abiding" in some place or con
dition, as the Ma-Lon (Ex. 4:24), the A-Lon
of Ma-Mere (Gen. 13:18), &c., which seems
not "oaks," but may be gateways, as the Greek Py-Le and Py-Lon seems the Egyptian Pe-Lu-t
or "the gate," and so Pe-Lu-sion, and Latin
P-Luto, &c., and so Lan or "lodge," "abide"



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 255
(Gen. 19:2; 24:23, 25; 32:22, &c.), originally
perhaps at the ''entrance" of a place, the Greek
Py-Le, perhaps the Egyptian word Le or Re, ''mouth"; hence the word Lon or Lun is not
"murmur," it must seem, but the disposition
to remain as they had been; and so, at the
making of the Apis-calf, Aharon says "you
know the people it for a Pheraa" (not B
Raa), "and Mosheh saw the people it for a Phareaa, for a Pheraaoh of Aharon to whisper
in their Kem-i" (Ex. 32:22, 25), which may be that they whispered in "Egyptian" or Kemi; Kem-ah or "granary" being here pertinent in Hebrew, and Kam is "garden" in Egyptian; and that they were disposed to return to Pha
raoh for lack of a "prince" or some one to
lead them (comp. Judges 5:2; Ex. 5:4) as the
context in vs. 22, 34, shows, and that the calf w^as the Elohim who with Aharon was to go before them to Pharaoh; hence the leadership
of the calf made of them (Ex. 32:17), not
"people as they shouted," but "people of Phe
reaoh."
25. While the Greek word Phoe-Nek-as,
our Phenicia, seems to me the Egyptian place
Reseta-u or Pa-Leseta-u, "the Door of Pas
sages" (to the tomb), and the same as the
Greek name of the city Pe-Lousi-on, it is likely



256 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
that the Egyptian words Pha-Nak or ''the Nak," a serpent form of Set, the same as the
serpent ''Gianf' or Aa-Pep, gave the name; and so we have Pha-Ne^h-t or ''the Strong" as
a probabiHty. The evil-being Set or Sute^h,
the Hebrew Zadok, the Greek Styx, called in
Egypt Aa-Ne^h or "might3^-strong two-fold"
certainly seems the giant Aa-Nak of the He
brews. The frontier fortress "Gaza," properly
Aaz-ah, in Phoenicia, means "strong"; also
"goat," which as the gazelle was an emblem
of Set. The facts that Melek-Aareth or the
"skin-king" was a name of Deity at Tyre, that
as Molech he was the concept of Deity at Jerushalem and beyond Jordan, that as Bez or
le-Bus he gave name to Je-Bus or Jerushalem, that he was called Shimeshon and Eli-Jah-u on the coast, that his name was ^s-Av in Idamea, and Sha-Atil at Gibe-ah and Ja-Besh, &c., all tend to prove that Palestine was considered a
country of giants, or one ruled by them. In fact the word Aa-Nak or Anak means in Arabic "long-neck." The wealthy and luxurious Egyptians must have regarded the uncouth country people of Judea and Idumea as
barbarians; indeed, called those Aa-Aam-u or
"great-Eaters" who dwelt or rather roved in
north Arabia; and this name tends to prove



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 257
that the Aam or "people" of Israel were an Arab tribe, yet as Pelusium was Aam they
might have dwelt there. There is for me little
doubt, however, that the giants of the Hebrew
writings took name from the I-Gig-i and Anunak-i of the Chaldeans, the former good
and the latter bad ''arch-angels," as these
names give us Aanak as well as Gog or A-Gog or Aog; and these were doubtless the "Geni-i" or Shed-im of Hebrew and Chaldaic (Deut.
32:17; Ps. 106:36-37).



SECTION VIII
I. Enclosed on all sides by more civilized
and ardently religious peoples, save the nomads
to the south-east, it is easy to imderstand that
the Israelites or Hebrews shared the religious
concepts of their neighbors. This was cer
tainly true down to the time of ^zraa, and
perhaps a century or two later. A thousand
years after the supposed date of Mosheh we
find Deity at Jerushalem called Ba-Aal, and the goddess was Aash-Ter-eth or Bosh-eth
(Jere. 9:14; 11:13, &c.). This Ba-Aal or
"In-the-Above'' was not perhaps precisely the Chaldean Bel or Bel-Marduk, but their ''the
Tam-Uz'' (Ezek. 8:14), the solar hero for whom in autumn women lamented, though Tam-Uz seems to mean "E n d-of-L i g h t." Tam-Uz was the name of the month AugustSeptember in Hebrew and Chaldean, called Shaw-al by the Arabs; and so as Sha-Aul his
great shrine was at Gibe-ah. Old folk-lore
told of him as the first king and as Meshiu^'h
or "anointed" ; hence masculine of Ma-She^'h
ith or the "destroyer,'' whose temple was on



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 259
the Mount of Olives (2 K. 23:13), and who is identified with Aash-Tor-eth. Sha-Aul was
the ""Hamed or ''desire" (i Sam. 9:20) of women (Dan. 11:37), from which word Mo""Hamed the Arab derived name; hence as the
Zeb-i or ''glories" of Israel (2 Sam. 1:19) he
and his son connect with the "gazelle" depicted
as the frontlet of the god Reshep by Egyp
tians ; and the Zebi was an emblem of Set, and
doubtless expresses the hairy ^sav of Seair
ah. In the Koran we find Sha-Aul called Tal-ut, which corresponds with what Her
odotus says of the Arabs, that their names for Deity and his mate were Horo-Tal and Alil-at, perhaps Horus-Tal; and a Tel or Gibe-ah is a "hill," "tall," "heap"; but Talul means in
Hebrew "tormented," and we have "greatdrouth" or Tal-Aob-eth in the Hoshea (13:5),
perhaps "tormenting-spirit," as Aob means
"familiar-spirit" ; while Alil-at is evidently the Moon-goddess or Night-goddess who appeared as Aa-Lat-ah to Abram when the Shemesh went down (Gen. 15:17). 2. Certainly Zeb-i may by reversal be I
Bez, but whether so or not the identity of ShaAul with Malach-Aareth and other fierce and
hairy concepts, such as ^s-av and Shimesh-on
and Eli-Jahu and Je-Bus or Bes, and these



26o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
with Ba-Aal during the time of the ferocious
Jeremiah, that is, during the Captivity, is ap
parent. They were the same concept of Deity
or his representative in separate places or
among different tribes and nations. None of
these were so merciless as Jehoah, who de
stroyed all life by a Deluge on the Euphrates, or Raa, who attempted to destroy mankind on the Nile. The lion forms of Deity in Egypt
were of this same system of the priests to in
fluence men to their betterment by terror. A-Nep or "Anubis," of the "jackal" or "fox" head, which is Shual in Hebrew, perhaps the same as Sheol or Hades and Sha-Aul the king, was lord of embalming and of the dead in Egypt, and by reversal of his name we have him as le-Pun-eh or "the Nup-ei" the father
of Chaleb or the "dog"-saint of ''Heberon, but
it is almost as likely that he connects with
Sheol.
3. Molech, the Akkdian Mulge, lord of
the Underworld, who by a mis-placed letter is
Lamech the father of Tubal-Kain or Noa^'h,
was, in the days of Jeremiah (7:31, &c.), sup
posed to be that special concept of Deity to
whom infants were sacrificed at Jerushalem;
and that he was the warrior-god and the
drouth-god, that is, the scorching Sun of



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 261
Summer, is quite clear. At Jerushalem there
were high-places of Tophet in the Gai of the son of Hinnom; Gai-Hinnom becoming GeHenna or Sheol in later times; but the Greeks
evidently derived the garden-waterer or cupbearer Ga-Nym-ede from the mighty Num or
^H-Num of Egypt, originally a personification of the Nile, and Gai-ha-Nom is seemingly an awkward Hebraism of his name; perhaps an
intentional one, for as ''ha-Nom" or "the
slumberer'' this rain-god might cause ''drouth"
or Ja-Besh, and hence the play on his name. Mo-Lech thus connects as la-Besh or drouthgod with Sha-Aul who was buried at Ja-Beshah, and with Jeho-Shuaa if this solar concept was the Egyptian Shuu the twin of the liongoddess Tefnut, "moisture," perhaps Tophet;
and the name Shuu means "dry," "light," &c.
and she, it is urged, was the same as Daphne, the love of Apollo at Grecian Thebes, and his
priestess or Sybil at Delphi, called also Manto, perhaps as the Egyptian queen of Amen-ti, and the Ti-Menath-ah wife of Shimesh-on and Jehud-ah, whence the Greek word Manteia or
"divination." Tefnut as lion-goddess would
be much the same as Se^het of Memphis, Bas-t,
or others of that figure, for Bas-t seems fem
inine of Bes, and the lion-god ""Ha-Bes of



262 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Abyssinia, as well as that Besh-eth or ''shame
ful-thing" who seems the consort of Ba-Aal
(Jere. ii :i3), but who is addressed (3:23-24)
as "Truly to the liar from the hills, Hamon of the mountains," &c., as if Besheth was masculine, and the same as Haman the Agag-i.
At least in this latter text (v. 24) we have it
that Besheth had devoured flocks and herds,
sons and daughters, which points to Molech as Besheth; and, as la-Besh is "drouth," and la-Besh of Gile-Aad was in or near Aammon where the name of God was Molech (i K. 11:7), the connection seems assured, unless Milech-Am or Melech-mother (v. 5) be that la-Bish-ah whose devotees by night brought to
her the body of the first Malach, and fasted
seven days (i Sam. 31 111-13). 4. The fierce Lamech or Malech, also con
nected with ''sevens" (Gen. 4:24; 5:31), a number sacred to Apollo or the Sun, was father of Noa'h or Ma-Noa"h, who like ^Hanoch of the 365 years, "walked a God," not
"with" God. Lech is to "walk," to "go," and Ma-Lech or "king" seems in Hebrew to con
nect with it. Strictly, however, Ma-Lech
would mean in places "from going," with the
sense of the inanimate, the still, the dead. Ma
Leach, "angel," "messenger," "workman," cer



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 263
tainly seems connected with the word Lech. Ma-Lech was probably a title of the Sun which had "gone-over"; and in places (Deut. 1:19; 2.\y^ the word Lech-ath is rendered "went
through/' in much the sense of Aaber or "passed-through," so that Ma-Lech may be used in the sense of the "departed" ; wherefore
as the representative of the absent Deity the
title was transferred to the ruler or "King." 5. Molech was a name of Ba-Aal (Jere. 19:5; 32:35), who was the Egyptian evil-god
Set, called also Nub-ti and Sute^h, and perhaps El Shadd-ai or "God Almighty"; perhaps El Shed-im or "God of the Demons" (Ps. 106:37; Deut. 32:17), the Chaldean "geni-i" or Shed
im, to whom the Hebrews sacrificed children;
and Jehoah claims that he was El Shadd-ai
(Ex. (^\'^^, or appeared as El Shadd-ai. That
these names refer to a solar phase seems prob
able from the famous passage of the Amos
(5:26) where it is said "Ye bore the shrines of your Ma-Lach, and like the Sun your images; a star your God"; Chi-Un* or "like
* Chi-Uun may be read Chivvan, and this is more probable as fitting the context; and Chivvan was the Assyrian name of the star Saturn, the Akkadian "high-prince" or SakUsh; and this is explained elsewhere in this volume. Yet it seems impossible that the mass of people should worship
any star, for even at this day they do not know one star from another.



264 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the-Sun" referring to the city ''On," the Egyp
tian An-nu, which was Grecised into Heho
poHs ; Ma-Lach thus connecting with the Sun
set God A-Tum or Tern, special deity at Annu,
as also at Pi-Thom or Per-Atem the ''house of
Tern," and perhaps at Raa-Meses or "Sun-of
Evening," two towns built for the King by the
Aibera-im as Mes-^'Hen-oth or "lying-in" cities
for women, or for the reposing Sun-god as his Mish-Chan or "tabernacle." The old Sun was
the father of the young, the Sun of morning or
of Spring. And it was the old Sun, the Sun
of evening, passing into the Dua-t of the
Egyptians, the 0-De-os of the Greeks, as ODyss-eos did, hence the god Ha-Des, who
suffered, but was awful, fateful, eternal, and
was lord of the re-born in the future life. Raa
was the general name of the Sun in the skies,
among the Egyptians, but the several positions
the Sun occupies were the physical antecedents
of other solar personifications. Sa-Raa or
"Son of Raa," a title adopted in the early
dynastic times by the kings, may have given us
I-Se-Ra-El as children of Raa-El or the "Sun
god" ; and with this must be noted the message
of Jehoah to Pha-Reaoh (Ex. 4:22), "I-Sera
El is my son, my Bechor"; but it does not



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 265
follow that Jehoah and Iza^'hak are the same,
or that Jakob and ''Osiris'' or A-Sar are one.
6. The Phoenicians as well as the Egyptians made up triads. Daud, whom Greeks
translate Eros or ''love/' is made the son of Zadek, which seems the Egyptian Sute^h (Set), the Greek Styx, and Malechi-Zadek of Shalem is evidently the same. In another
account, the Phoenician Zadek is father of
eight sons, called Kabir-i, as "Jesse" or Ishai
has eight sons ; and Zadek' s youngest is EshMun or E-Shemun, but the Greeks identified him with ^skul-Api-os, who they said was son of Apollo ; and the story was that Esh-Mun was a handsome youth who mutilated himself to escape the love of Aash-Ter Nosema the mother of the gods, who with the help of Ruphe "healed" Esh-Mun with her "heat" or ""Ham-un; whereas David got no ''Ham from Abi-Shag or Hebe-Shag, as Herakles from Hebe, and perhaps Mosheh from Pi-Sag-ah.
In the triad at Beth Le'^hem, of Bo-Aaz and Ruth and Aobed, Naa-Omi is only "nurse" or Amon-eth.
7. A third Phoenician myth makes Dad or Ha-Dad the son of Aes-Thar Noa-Ema by her father El or II, whom the Greeks render
Kronos ; but El is also called El Melach, whom



266 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the Hebrew story considers the dead husband of Naa-Omi. Aobed is thus a name of David, and both are phases of Osir-Dad or -Tad, whose great shrine at Abyd-os means (Budge
says) Ab-Du or the ''heart's desire." But
Zadek or Ishai (''Jesse"), as father of the
Kabir-i, is thus identified with Hephsest-os or
Vulcan, whom classic story makes father of the
Kabir-i, perhaps Gibbor-im.
8. Another curious account is that David or Ha-Dad was king at Damascus, and was
killed by ''Haza-El or "sleep-god," while Eli
Shaa stood by and wept, as did Jesus or Ishai the son of David when El-Azer-us slept. David's girl, however, may be Abish-Ag, connecting with Sha-AuFs la-Bish-ah ; and it was A-Besh-Alom or "bad-youth," not "Ab-salom," who is caught up by the Sob-ach of the El-ah but Joab would not permit such a saviour, for another account (2 Sam. 10:16-18) says Shobach was chief of Zebe to Ha-Dad Aezur,
and was killed by David at ""Helem-ah or "dreamer" shortly before it caught A-BeshAlom ; Sebek being the crocodile form of. Deity
in Egypt, and the "thicket" which caught the
ram that saved Iza'^hak as his fanatic father
was at the point of sacrificing him ; both Iza'^hak
and A-Besh-Alom being perhaps phases of



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 267
Horus, and the crocodile or Shed-et being the
''concealed," as the hieratic meaning of its
figure; but the great El-ah in the case of ABesh-Alom implies perhaps the "goddess" Ta
Ur or ''the great" who is often depicted with
the head of the crocodile. 9. If Aberaham and Iza'^hak and Ja-Aakob were a triad they would seem like the saying of the Sun-god, "I am ^Hephera at morning,
Raa at noon, and Tem at evening." Aber in the name Abera-Ham means "over," the Greek Hyper, and much the same as Aaber, which is usually rendered "pass-over" ; and Aber is also
rendered "wing," "pinion," "feather," with
which a fowl "soars" (Job 39:26); so that Abera-Ham seems an eponym of the Aabera-im or "Hebrews," as Isra-El or Ja-Aakob is of
the Isera-El-i, or rather these people gave name
to the two patriarchs. It can scarcely be
doubted that the word Aaber refers to the boat of the Sun, and that Abera-Ham was conceived of as solar, as his passing westward might
indicate in the story of him. Had there been
such an ancestor the cave Ma-Chephel-ah
where he and Sar-ah, Iza'^hak and Jakob, were
buried would have been the focus of a pilgrim
age ; but the place is never alluded to after the
burial there of Jakob, though it was said to be



268 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
at ""Heberon; a fact tending to show that the
story of these personages was written subse
quent to much of the Scriptures. The word Ma-Chepel-ah possibly is feminine of ^Hephera, a name of Deity as connected with the
rising Sun and with re-birth and resurrection* typefied by the ^Hephera, the Latin Sacer-Ab or ''scarab," consonant with Egyptian Seker
Ab or the ''shut-up fly," which in Greek is
Kophero-Phagos or "dung-eater," and perhaps the Hebrew Cher-Areb or Cherub or "borer
fly" which stood over the Cheppor-eth or "Hd" of the Aron, on which hd a Cheppor or ^Hepher
was evidently pictured. I-Za'^hak or "laugh
ter" is probably from Za^'h-ah or "shining,"
"bright," and seems some aspect of the sky or Sun. lo. la-Aa-Kob means "wine-vat" in He
brew and "grief" in Egyptian, but it seems to
me most probable that the name is a reverse of Bok-aa. This word means to "open," to
"cleave," as Pata'^h does, and the two words
are used when (Gen. 7:11) it is said the fountains of the great Tehom were Beke-Aa and the Areb-oth of the Heavens were Pata'^h. In
* Chapel for ^Hepera would not necessarily conflict with ^Hepera as Cheppor or "atonement," for in Egyptian the L
and R are the same.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 269
Egyptian the mountain of the Sun-rise was Baa-^ha, and the mountain of Sun-set was
Man-u, or Ta-Man-u the ''land-of-Sun-set" from which latter perhaps their Amen-ti or "west" and "hidden" place; and with the Hebrew Ti-Men-ath or Ti-Mun-ah where the solar ideals Shimesh-on and Je-Hud-ah got wives, and Je-Hoshu-Aa was buried, and connecting with the Sun-set god Tem-u as the
"perfected," "completed." Beke-Aa in Hebrew also means the same as Bez-Aa, to
"cleave," to "rend," and so Ja-Aakob connects
with both Pata^'h and Bes, or Aa-Zeb the "sorrowful," who was the A-Dam or A-Tem or E-Dom of the Hebrews, brother-twin of laAakob or Baa^ha. The classic name Bakchus comes perhaps from this word for the Sun-rise, or from Baa^h the "inundation" God. The initiation of la-Aakob at la-Bok by la-Abek or "wrestling" seems to point to his name as Bok
aa, the Egyptian Baa^'ha or Sun-rise, for the Sun Zera^'h upon him as he Aaber Penu-El;
besides which his twelve sons are the twelve months. Laban or "white" was a name of the Moon, whose daughters la-Aakob married
while he was in ^'Haur-an or the "cave." II. It may be that Abera-Ham and
I-Za^'hak and la-Aakob were aspects of the



270 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Sun, with a shrine at ""Heberon, formerly
called Kiri-ath Aaber-i, "city of Hebrews,"
but perhaps in derision of its religion called
city of Arebaa or ''bestiality" (Lev. 18:23;
20:16, ''lie-down") in later times. Aaber or
"pass-over" can only allude to the people as
children of the Sun, which was given a Bar-is or Aaber-ah, called by the Egyptians Maad-et or Aad-et in the morning; Maad-et meaning "becoming-strong" ; the Hebrew Moed or "ex
ceedingly," and the Ohel Mo-Aad or "tent of
meeting" ;* and the boat of afternoon was called
Seket-et or Semeket-et or "becoming weak"
(Budge), which may explain the Such-oth of
the allegoric Exodus (Ex. 12:37) and of the
risen Ja-Aakob, as well as the autumn feast of
Such-oth or "tabernacles" ; and so the Cherub
im Such-oth the Aron (i K. 8:7), while the
Israel-i bore the Sichuth or Seket-et of their
Malach, the boat of decrease, and images like the Un or "Sun" when it became weaker as the Renpa (Egyptian for "year") was closing
(Amos 5:26; Acts 7:43). Indeed, Ja-Aakob was supplicated by the Ma-Leach-i at Ma
*In at least one place (Ex. 16:34) the Aad-ith or "testimony," rendered "tabernacle" by the Septuagint, is the Aron
in which the manna and law were kept; and the fact that the divine barge in Egypt had an eye depicted on the prow
agrees with the Hebrew word Aad or "witness."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 271
''Han-ah, or smitten by them, and ''Hennu was
the boat of the Sun which was also called Seker
or "shut-up," and supposedly another name for
the Seket-et or boat on which the Sun enters
the Dua-t, and which I identify not only with Such-oth but with the Seair-ah or oryx-barge
of ^sav and A'^hud and Job and Eli-Jahu, with the difference between autumn and win
ter, as ''Returned /Esav to his way Seair-ah, and la-Aakob journeyed Such-oth-ah" (Gen.
33:16-17), as he went ''to the feet of the
Maleach-ah which before" him (v. 14), that is, the woman-angel, for he asked his Adon to
Aaber before him. 12. The Theiash-im were "he-goats" sent
by la-Aa-Kob to /Esav (Gen. 32:14) ; but, as Aaz-im just before means "goats," not "she
goats," it may be inferred that Theiash means
some other hairy beast or "being" as the word lesh impHes; and yet Plutarch (in "These-us")
places the establishment of the 0-Socha-phoria
or feast of boughs at the door of These-us the son of the "goat" ^ge-us, and this in the
month Pa-Nep-si-on, while the son of These-us
was ^nop-is, clearly suggesting in both cases
A-Nup or "Anub-is" the angel of the tomb, the
son or variant of Set, the Greek Typh-on, the
Arab Tawfan or "whirl-wind," the Hebrew



272 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Seair-ah (Job 9:17; 38:1; 2 K. 2:1, 11) or ''goat-barge'' of the winter Sun, worshipped
by the Hebrews (Lev. 17:7; 2 Chr. 11:15) ^^^ Egyptians. And the Greek 0-Socha-Phoria was in honor of Bakch-os and Ari-Adon-e, or in Hebrew the "hon-goddess/' who hke Ra
""Hel had a nurse, and called Kora-Kyn-a; in Egyptian ^Her-u meaning 'Voice," Kara or "cry'' in Hebrew, Keras in Greek; hence KorKyon is probably "barking-dog," and so Deborah the nurse of Ra'^hel means "word" or "or
acle." Besides, both Ari-Adane and Ra'^hel,
as also Semele, died in child-birth.
13. These-us is further identified with Hebrew and Egyptian story by his marriage with ^-Gel-e, daughter of Pa-Nope-us or "the Anup" or Anubis, and lo-Gal-e seems the "heifer" Hathor, who as Ae-Gal-ah or
"heifer" was wife of David (2 Sam. 3:5) ; yet
in Hebrew the word is also "wagon," "chariot,"
thus connecting with the watchful constellation of the Wain or Ursa Major, which in Egypt was connected with Rer-et or Lel-et, that is, Ta-Ur ; and the son of David's Ae-Gal-ah was I-There-Aam, as the mother of These-us was Ae-Thera, perhaps Ta-Ur, and the Phoenician
goddess Thor-o or "law"; and yet Thera in
Hebrew also means "excessive" or "over



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 273
much," as in Egyptian Ta-Ur is "the mighty,"* and so le-Thero as priest of Midi-an or
"gianf'-land may only express a giant. The death of These-us at Sekyr-os must allude to
the Sekar boat of the winter Sun in Egypt;
also called ^'Hennu, which gives us the Ma''Han-ah of David and Ja-Aakob (2 Sam. 17: 24; Gen. 32:22), and of course Shimesh-on
is in touch with it (Judges 13:25). ManesTheos, who drove away These-us, is the "mane-god," hence hairy, and the same as ^sav and A-Besh-alom, both hairy, who drove away Ja-Aakob and David. Some say These
us did not establish the Isthmian Games to
honor Melech-Aareth, but to honor Sekyr-on,
which only means that the two are the same,
and that they are These-us as well as Seker
Osiris and the Segor or "shut-up" Noa'^h
(Gen. 7:16); all which enables us to connect
the Tyrian Malech-Aareth with the sea-god
Poseidon.
14. Curiously, the hair of Horus was
called ''Hen-Sek-et, and this might seem to
connect with the ''Hennu or Sek-et boat, and
* Shimeshon deceives his wife by telling her that he "over-much shining" or le-Tar-im La^h-im, rendered "ropes
new," would be weakened, etc. He next tells her to bind
him with Aab-oth not made by a workman, and Aab-oth means "thick clouds" as well as "cords."
18



274 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
with the Hebrew Seair-ah, as both are the
goat-barge of the autumn Sun; the Hebrew Such-oth being a name of this barge or portable "tent" of the departing Sun-god, over which was arrayed skins of beasts; and the feast and word were common to Persians (Strabo ii:8; 5-6), to Greeks, to Carthage
nians (Diod. Sic. 20:25), as well as to Jews and Egyptians; giving name to the hairy Scyth-ians or Sakyth-ians (Herod. 7:64) who destroyed Nineveh and the Assyrian monarchy, and invaded Egypt and Palestine about B. C.
622.
15. It must appear that la-Aakob erected Such-oth as a memorial of hairy ^sav, the
earlier name of the local Deity or Penu-El the
"afore-God,'' over whom la-Aakob passed as
the Shemesh arose; but Nu or the ''sky" in Egyptian was also Nu or Pe-Nu, a species of
"antelope" with horns like those of the Seker barge; and the Greek concept Pan was that
aspect of Osar-is worshipped at Dad-u or *'Mendes," called Ba-en-Dad-u or "ram of Da
vid," evidently the Bo-Aaz of Beth Le^'hem, as Aaz means "goat," and Bo-Aaz was clearly an aspect of ^s-av, though Ra'^hel or "ewe"
is made wife of la-Aakob, while the wife in the triad of "Mendes" was an aspect of Hathor



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 275
Isis, whose name Me^'het means the oryx-goat. Osir-Dad-u impHes the generator. Such-oth,
where I-Sera-El begun a pass-over of the MaDebar, would serve to suggest embarkation
in the Seker or Sek-et barge, as Such-oth was next to E-Tham or with the Sun-set god Tem or Atum, and so Such-oth was near by RaaMeses or the "Sun of Evening" (Ex. 12:37;
13:20). It was his ship with black sails with which These-us destroyed ^ge-us, the Egyptian ''Heg or ''goat," probably connected with Agag and Aog of Bashan, who are Haman the Agag-i; and so the Egyptian Ab-u was the Chabesh of the Hebrews, and hence lo-Ab who killed A-Besh-Alom would connect with the "ewe-lamb" or Chabesh-ah which David "ravished" (comp. Esth. 7:8) or Chabesh-ah from Auri-Jah. Cha-Bes or Cha-Besh is by transposition Cha-Sheb-ah (Gen. 21:28; 30: 39; 2 Sam. 12:1; Lev. 5:6), hence Bath-Shebaa was the ewe-lamb "ravished" or "forced";
but Cha-Besh or "trample," "ravish," "ewe
lamb," same as Cha-Seb, is clearly the hairy
Bes or la-Bez, and the text (Lev. 5:6) says
a "Chi-Seb-ah or Seair-eth Aaz-im for a sin
offering," while the reverse of Cha-Bes is
Seb-ach or "thick-boughs" which caught up
A-Besh-alom and caught the ram substituted



276 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
for I-Za^'h-ak; and Suchoth is "thicket/'
''boughs," and as "tabernacles" was an autumn
observance imitating the Sun going into his
Mish-Chan or "tabernacle," which latter is the Egyptian word, Hebraised into Shechan or
"dwelling," and the Shechin-ah of later Juda
ism which implies that Jehoah is present in his
habitation. 1 6. ^Hephesh in Egyptian was the "thigh" of Set, and the never-setting seven
stars of the Great Bear, called also Mes^heti.
This is the Aash of the Job (9:9; 38:32), the Naash or Ghash of the Arabs, meaning both a "wagon" and "night-watcher." Ur-t is
"chariot" in Egyptian, and they depicted the Jewish goddess Aash-ta-Ur-t as a lion-head war-goddess driving a chariot. Their own terror-goddess Rer-t or Ta-Ur or Shepu-t was
also connected with this constellation. She
must also have been goddess of flocks and fecundity (Deut. 1:4; "young" in 7:13; 28:4,
18, but it should be "goddess"), and as their
night-watcher. These "seven" or Sheb-aa stars were perhaps "sworn" by or Sheb-aa, and hence Bath-Shebaa was perhaps a name
of her, as David first saw her at eventide from
the Geg or "roof" (comp. Aog, &c., Deut. i
4); and so Abraham (Gen. 21:30) gave



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 277
''seven" Cha-Bes-eth "in the Aabur'' that it be
an Aad-ah or ''perpetual-witness" that he dug
the well of Shebaa as the south bounds of the Aabera-im; so Bath-Shebaa was a "ewe-lamb" or Chi-Bes-ah (2 Sam. 12:3), the ^Hephesh or constellation sacred to the goddess. But as
a "wagon" or Ae-Gal-ah, because it went Gal or "round," she was the wife of David and of These-us. Ja-Aakob married the "ewe" Rachel.* The shrine Gile-Aad, the Ja-Bish-ah Gile-Aad of Sha-Aul, was called Mi-Zeph-ah (Gen. 31:49) or "watcher," and was a shrine
of Tan-oth the daughter of le-Petha^'h. In
Greece this constellation was called Kal-Ishto;
also Helike, perhaps ha-Lech-ah or "the trav
eller" in Hebrew, or ha-Le'^h-ah as "the shining" ; and her son by Zeus was Ark-as ; perhaps as an archer like I-Shemaa-El, for Laban's leGar Sahad-uth suggests Hagar and the well
La'^ha-i Ro-i which refers to herself as the
"bright watcher." 17. Gula or "great" the wife of the Sun in Akkadia, and who was notable in Chaldean
theology under that name and that of Ai, is
distinguished on existing stelae by the "circle" after her name, Gol in Hebrew, and the towns Gile-Gal and xAai seem to bear her name.
Correctly, one who "wanders" in search of sheep.



278 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
When "in Ja-Besh-ah Aaber Isera-El the Jore
dan'' (Josh. 4:22), he first encamped at Gile
Gal, and there celebrated the first Pa-Sa^'h by
eating the Aabur of the land (5:11); but in
another version of his arrival the Gal or "heap"
was east of the Joredan, though after he had passed the river (Gen. 31:21), but both
legends refer to a pile of stones (Gen. 31 146;
Josh. 4:20), and the one as a Gale-Aad, the other as a witness of the Aaber in Ja-Bash-ah
whereas, when this hero is called David, he comes from Ma-'^Hen-ah or "camp,'' Aaber or "passes-over" in the Aaber-ah to Gile-Gal, and is met by Shime-Aai who had cast stones at him. The mighty Sha-Aul was crowned at
Gile-Gal, slain at Gil-Boa, buried at Ja-Bish
ah of Gile-Aad, and I have pointed out that his name indicates him as the Akkadian UshuGal, while the "Gol to me this day a great
stone" (i Sam. 14:33) when he built his first
altar to Jehoah seems to connect him with this
same abstruse story; nor must we omit that
Eli-Jahu went from Gile-Gal (occasionally rendered "whirlwind") to meet the Seair-ah
or "whirlwind," first Aaber the Joredan in
''Harab-ah or "dry-ground" after striking the
river with his ie-Gel mantle, but naught is said
of stones. The association of stones and



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 279
drouth with Gula or Gile-Gal, and other forms
of this word, indicates that Gula was what she was on the lower Euphrates, the female power
of the scorching Sun. Gal or ''great" became
in Hebrew Aul or Ail and El, that is, the "strong,'' "mighty"; the Egyptian Ur or Ul; hence Sha-Aul or "Saul" ; but Gal and Gol and
Gil-Gal, &c., was separately in Hebrew
"round," a "fountain," a "skull," a "captive,"
to "reveal" or "uncover," "naked"; and
as "whirl-wind" or Seair-ah we may see that
the connection is with solar concepts. Gula's mate in Chaldea was San or Sansi, "the Sun," hence Beth Shan was the proper place to hang the body of Sha-Aul, though Ja-Bish-ah of Gile-Aad later received it as "drouth"-goddess,
also called ^'Horeb-ah. In the Egyptian
"Praises of the Sun," he is called ''Her-Ba or "Soul-Above," and he is depicted with Ba or
"ram" horns; which makes it curious that
Msheh should first communicate with Jehoah
at the Mountain of ''Hor-Eb-ah, as Msheh is
very like Seh or "lamb," and when he de
scended the mountain with the law "like a
karan or horn a rising of his face" (Ex. 34:
29) ;* horn being metaphoric of strength^
*In no other place in the English version is Karan rendered "shone." The Vulgate has it in this placs Cornuta, The



28o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
power, as Amen-Raa and ^Hnum are depic
tured.
1 8. Connection of a flock with a nightwatcher which wheeled or revolved above the
Ma'^het or "north" horizon is easy in religious
ideas, but Ma'^het was also the ''oryx" in Egyp
tian, the head of which was the prow of the
""Hen-nu boat. That the nurse angel Ta-Ur
should also connect with this concept will
appear from her name Lil-et (or Rer-et),
which in Egyptian means ''to go round," in
Hebrew "night"; hence "revolving" or
"round," "wheel," "chariot," render the Chal
dean Quia, wife of the Sun, the same as the
Aa-Gal-ah of David and These-us, the De-Lil
ah who shaved Shimesh-On, the Aash-ta-Urit or "many-chariot" woman in Egyptian, the
goddess of the Seair-ah or Sekar or ''Henn-u
or Seket or Such-oth or la-Besh-ah or ""Horeb
ah or Aaber-ah, the barge of the Sun, or its
chariot. Some of these may refer to the Sun
in his moribund condition, such as the Egyp
tian "vessel" or Aren, the "ark" of the He
brews, and the Egyptian Teb which as "box"
supplies us with the Teb-ah or "chest" of
play of words must be on Keraa or its derivatives, meaning to "read" (Ex. 24:7, etc.), that is, the commandments he brought; hence the Arabic Koaran or book to be "read."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 281
Noa'^h and Mosheh, yet the conceit is that all
"pass-over" or Aaber the sky or water, in boat
or in chariot.
19. The concept of the Euphratic peoples
was that the Sun went into a ''cave/' and was there re-born; hence Ja-Aakob went from the well of Sheb-aa to ''Har-an, whence came Aberaham, as These-us went into and came out of the labyrinth of Min-os, &c. ; but These-us, who seems the same as the Thasian Malech-Aareth (Herod. 2:44), that is, perhaps, a combination of Herakles and Bakchos, specially worshipped in Thas-os or ^-Thera, was a son or aspect of Poseidon also, for Thas-os was son of Agen
or or "Ocean," and sent from Phoenicia to find his sister Europa, which makes him an aspect of Kadmus of Thebes. The Thesmo-phoria
festival was the counterpart of the 0-Socha
phoria, and celebrated by women in honor of Keres or De-Meter five days later ; both in PaNepsi-on; but lom Chepher is observed five days after Such-oth, and thus responds to Thesmo-phoria, which was also celebrated in
huts or booths. Thesmo is "law" in Greek, as Tor-ah is "law" in Hebrew, but that Thesmo
phoria was an observance to the "law"-giver
seems in the face of the statement of Herodotus
(2:171) that this observance was brought from



282 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Egypt, which should have placed scholars on search of an Egyptian meaning, and this I
ascertain to be The-Shema (fern.) or ''the
traveller,'' as Cer-es was in search of her stolen
daughter.''' Possibly the ''fugitive" Hagar
called her son I-Shem-aa-El, the divine nomad, for the Egyptian word Shema. Had-es, who
stole the daughter of Cer-es, was evidently in
his origin the burning Sun, who in turn dis
appears, getting name from "the Duat," or Ho-Dua-es as Greeks would say, the Egyptian Under-world. Isera-El, fleeing from Egypt,
took Chel-i of gold and Chel-i of silver and
Semel-oth (Gen. 12:35), and in places Chel-ah
means "bride" (Isaiah 49:18; 61:10; Jere. 2:
32) and "daughter-in-law" (Gen. 38:11; Ruth 1 :6), as Kala in Greek is "fair"; and Bakch-os
brought his mother Sem-Ela out of Hades. These-us not only carries off Ari-Adane and
Helen, but attempts the abduction of Kora or Persephone from her father Aidon or Hades.
* An argument may well be made, however, that These
us is named from the Greek word Thes-thai, "to put," "to set,"^ a law or pledge, and hence the Teiash or "he-goat" sent by Ja-Aakob to his brother, though Budge tells us the TeshTesh was the figure of Osiris over which the funeral cere
monies were performed at Mendes, Abydos, etc. And in
Egyptian the word Samen means to "establish," as Sum in
Hebrew (Job 17:3, etc.) is to "set-up," so Te-Samen and The-Semo-phoria might indicate a festival to the "foimder"
of the town or the one who established it, as These-us did.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 283
Ja-Aakob brings off two brides from ''Hauran or the "cave," daughters of Laban; but Nabal is a reverse of Laban, and it is his wife that David seduces from Charem-El or the "vine
yard-god/' It is not only probable that the
Semel-ah or over-cloth of the Hebrew connects as a travelling garment with the Egyptian
word Sema or Shema as ''traveller," but that the famous The-Sema-phoria of the Greeks was a carrying to "the wanderer" Ceres or DeMeter; the The or Te being the feminine def
inite article in Egyptian. And yet Sem was the
"summer" or warm season in Egypt, and this
might apply to the time of the celebration of Thesmo-phoria at Thebes, but at Athens and
most places the festival took place the latter
part of October.
20. There is no question that in Egyptian
myth Asar or "Osiris" was that judge of the dead whom the Greeks called Hades, the Latin Pluto, the Cretan Min-os, the Akkadian Mulgi
or Malach, &c. ; and from the fact that Chris
tians, who inherit their creed largely from these
peoples, hold their divine man Jesus as judge
of the dead, it may be that Asar and the others were deified men. But as judge it must seem that he must have a severe if not an awful
aspect as in case of Chebar Enosh or "glo



284 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
rious man" whose Shaletan (''Sultan") should
be everlasting (Dan. 7:13-14). It is curious
that the "hair" of Asar should be called Rer-et
or Lel-et, the name of the terror-aspect of
Isis-Hathor; seeming to connect with both
''night" and a "sow" or Rer-et, as with the
Hebrew word Arur or "cursed" ; and the ideograph for "hair" signifies both "black" and
"grief" in Egyptian, for in grief that people
allowed their hair to grow ; which fact perhaps
explains the contempt of the children who
called Eli-Shaa "bald-head" or Kerea'^h when
he should as in grief have had hair;* but Kerea^h or Gera^h in Egyptian means "night,"
yet is probably the same word as the Gela^'h or "shaven" Shimeshon and Josepht by some mix
ture of ideas.
21. The centre of the great Mother cultus called ^Het-^Her or "Hathor" was "Denderah" or "Tentyra," from the Egyptian name Ta-en
ta-Rer-et or "land-of-the-Rer-et" or Te-Lel-et,
* Egyptian women wore hair on the head ; the men were
shorne except when mourning. "Barbers" were called Ka^^h-u. t Joseph shaved and le-'^Haleph his garments (Gen. 41: 14) ; Shimeshon had seven Ma-^Heleph-oth, which is another form of the same word; and the "changed" of Joseph must indicate that Shimeshon had seven "changes" or "kinds" of hair; but "wearing the seven with Ma-Sech-ith" seems to refer De-Lil-ah or Ta-Rer-et to the seven stars of her constellation, called by Hebrews Aash, and hence perhaps Aashta-Ur-eth.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 285
and it is probable that Rer-et was her older
title, for Rer-et in some inscriptions of pre
historic time is called mother of the Sun. In
Crete we have her as Helen-Denderibis, and Hel-en must be from Heli-os or the Sun, but her father's name, Tyndar-us, connects her with "Tentyra" ; and These-us first carried off Helen. Rer as "going-round" might indicate the Bear constellation, and from "bear" or Deb in both Egyptian and Hebrew we might suspect the hairy Rer-et as feminine of the Rer or "hair" of Asar. Deb-Ur-t in Egyp
tian is both "great-bear" and "bear-chariot"; hence as Debor-ah the wife of "torches" she
led Bene-Isera-El to battle against Sisera, "and Bene-Israel came up to her to Mi-Shephat." Besides, Asar as "judge" or Ap of the dead might have first given her the name Ap-et which she is supposed to derive from the Ap-et or "hippopotamus," but it is curious that her name Shepu-t is the same as Shephat or
"judge" in Hebrew, and is related to her name
Ta-Ur which may have given the Phoenicians
their goddess Thor-o or "law," and their Aash
Thar-eth, or "Astarte" as the Greeks called
her. Aas-ah or "hairy" gives us the name
Aes-av, it is averred, whose return "to his way
of Seair-ah" (Gen. 33:16), which word means



286 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
"hair," "terror," "whirlwind," "goat," "de
mon," indicates that Seair-ah was Aash-Th
Ur-eth, who in her aspect as Ta-Ur-t or "the
chariot" goddess carried off EH-Jahu also ; but
as wife of Aes-av we may connect her with
Je-Hud-ith or "Jewess," otherwise Bas-Ameth or "maid-of-Bes" or Je-Bus. The word Aasah, however, is very frequent in the Hebrew;
not as "hairy," but as "doer," "to do," "maker,"
strictly synonymous with Ari in the name of As-Ar or "Osiris," and the same as Malach
or "worker"; but it need not be doubted that
Aes-av is the "skin-king" or Malach-Aareth,
though it is not clear that we have Asar as a
hairy concept in Egypt. And yet in a hymn
to Asar he is called Saa^'h-u or "master," the
ideograph of which is a "goat" with the life
sign about its neck,* singularly recalling the
word Ba-Aal when rendered "master" or
"lord," for Ba is both "soul" and "ram" in
Egyptian, as Aal-u is the celestial garden, thus
perhaps explaining the oracular passage (Gen. 27:40) where Aes-av is to ta-Rid (Egyptian "grow," and so Pa-Rad and "Pa-Rad-ise" or "the garden") and break the Aul; but the god
*This is the same word as Saa^hu or the spirit-form, the Greek P-Syche, but the determinative of this word is the funeral couch.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 287
Ba-Aal was usually identified by Egyptians with Set, though the consonance between the Egyptian word Saa^'h-u and the Hebrew word
Seair-ah is probable.
22. Egyptians, though shaven, depicted a
tuft of hair on the chin of dead men, and on
the chin of princes and captives ; often append
ing it to their figures while living. It may be
that this represented the Rer of Asar or the
^'Hen-Sek of ""Heru, each rendered "hair" or its
''locks" ; but in shaving the heads of their boys
they left a lock on the sides of the head, as
appears in figures of ''Har-pa-^'Herad, and we
may infer that this custom had some reference
to virility or strength. The Hebrew word
Aaz-ah means "strong" and "goat"; their word Seair means "hair" and "goat"; also "whirlwind," "demon." In Hebrew story Shimesh-on becomes weak and his Cho'^h or "strength" departs when he is shorn; whereupon he is taken to Aaz-ath-ah, rendered
"Gaza," but it is feminine, and is the Seair-ah
that Aes-av went to and that carried ofif Eli
Jahu; that is, the ^'Hennu or Sekar barge per
sonified as the strong and fierce Satyrs of
classic story; the Kadin Aaz-ah or "east
strong" (Ex. 14:21) spirit that parted the sea
for I-Sera-El ; she who as Ma-She'^h-ith or the



288 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
female Me-Shia^'h had her temple on Zion and
was the "destroyer" (2 Sam. 24:16) ; and in the
Egyptian story of the destruction of mankind
is called both Hathor and Se^het;* but it is
doubtful if Deb-Ur as ''great-bear" in Egyp
tian is the fierce Deb-or-ah, for Dibarra in
Chaldean story is the angel of the plague, and
yet as the watcher over shepherds this con
stellation seems the nurse of Reb-Ek-ah (Gen.
35:8) or "great wild-goat" (see Ako, Deut.
14:5), as Ta-Ur or Rer-et or Lel-et was a nurse in Egyptian myth, and Amal-Thea the
nurse of Zeus. At Aazath-ah the hair or
Seair of Shimeshon necessarily grew, enabling
him as before (Judges 16:1-3) to do strong
feats there; but it is curious that in Chaldaic
the Zodiac sign Capri-Cornu is called Lal-u
and in Assyrian it is Uz or E-Naz-u, thus giv
ing us De-Lil-a and Aaz, and the Naz-ir that
Shimeshon was, for Nazir means "hair" (Jere.
7:29) in Hebrew; and women in Syria cut off
their hair in lament for Adon-is, as men in
Egypt let it grow in their grief.
23. The goat was a symbol of Tan-ith in
Syria, and in Chaldea the goat-skin, the ^g-is
*At Deb-ut in the name of Uaz-et and at Dep-A^ha-t in
the name Maden ("sword"), both called Aphrodito-polis, Hathor was special goddess.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 289
of Zeus, was a symbol of the ''tempest," the Seair-ah or "whirlwind" of Eli-Jahu, Jonah, &c. ; and in the triad of Carthage Tan-ith was wife of Ba-Aal ""Hammon; evidently also the
Thoan-ah or "occasion" (Judges 14:4) of the
Philistines; also Tan-oth the daughter of Je
Petha^'h (11 140), and la-Ael who assassinated
Sisera, as her name means an ibex or wild-goat (i Sam. 24:2) ; hence as Aaz-ath-ah we must have her as Seair-ah, and as Reb-Ek-ah the mother of Aes-av and Aamal-Ek. The Zodiacal signs of the Chaldeans, adopted by the
Greeks, are inscribed at Denderah, and Capri
Cornu is the goat fore-parts with the tail of a fish. A coast town like Aaz-ah must have had a marine aspect of God, and so as late as the fourth century A. D. they there worshipped "Marn-as" as the Greeks wrote it, and which scholars interpret by the Aramaic as "Lord"
but, while Mare is Chaldaic for "lord" (Dan. 2:47), the words Mer-Ren in Egyptian mean "master-of-the-vessel," the A-Ron or "ark" of the Hebrews, as in Hebrew-Chaldaic Mare-Ani
would be "lord-of-fleets," and so the Latin word Marin-us, the Marin and Marine of the
French and English ; for ships passed-over the
^ge-an or "goat"-sea, a name from ""Hag or
''goat" in Egyptian, but a sea of storms and
19



290 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
dangers; yet the beloved Sun-god also passed over it, "shut-up" or Sekar in his Teb-eth or "ark/' and the month Teb-eth or DecemberJanuary corresponds with the goat-sign of the
Zodiac; and the Aazath-ah or Seair-ah was
both a terror and the 7Eg-is of Zeus, but she
was the hairy one. 24. Like Eli-Jahu, Ja-Aakob went up with a chariot and horses, and the Ma-^'Han-ah was very Chebad (Gen. 50:9); but he was first •"Han-et or "embalmed" by the Rephea-im or
"giants," and it may be that ''Han-et gives the
meaning of the ""Hennu boat; but in Egyptian "embalm" is Ut, and this may explain why the remains were taken to the Garon of At-Ad "which in the Aaber of the Joredan"; Aat in Egyptian meaning "region" or "place." The suburbs of Egyptian towns were thick with
priests and artisans who prepared the dead for
burial, and Greeks called these suburbs Mem
non-ia, probably from Men (also De^han) or
"obelisk" ; and the obelisk became the emblem of Amen-Raa. The Greek word Obel-os, a "spit" or pointed implement, is not in my
opinion the origin of Obeli-Sak-os ; Abel or
"grief" and Sak or "sack-cloth" both being Hebrew words; but from the Egyptian words
Ben-ben or Bel-bel, "obelisk," and Sekar or



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 291
''shut-up/' as Sakar-ah seems to mean a ceme
tery, while Bel-bel is a transition from Benben not uncommon. And Ben-ben is closely connected with the Ben-u, the supposed Phoenix of the Greek writers, which as Pa
Nea^'h or ''the living" seems a name Pharaoh
gave Joseph, and connected with the word
Phoenicia. But the Egyptians called the
obelisk the ''finger" of the Sun, and so from
the Hebrew word A-Zebaa or "finger" the Hebrew word Ma-Zeb or "pillar," and lad or "hand" erected by Sha-Aul and A-Besh-alom, which attest solar worship, perhaps that of Amen, as Shemu-El was an Amen priest (i Sam. 2:35), with whom we may probably connect Jehoah of Zaba-oth to whom the Ma-Zebs
were set up.
25. The Sulem Ma-Zeb or "ladder" seen in his dream by la-Aakob when a fugitive from Aes-av must have been a pyramid, on the steps of which Male-ach-i were moving and at the top of which Jehoah stood ; and Sulem suggests the Greek word A-Sylon and the A-Sylum of
the Latin. The "ladder" or Maket largely fig
ures in Egyptian theology as the means of
reaching the Heavens, and the word resembles
the Hebrew cities of Makelet or "refuge" ; but
the steps of pyramids also figure. la-Aakob



292 EGYPT AND ISRAFX
set up a Me-Zeb at this house of El or Beth-El,
but its name at the first was Aulem Luz or "forever departed," whereas Elohim was still there and it was the Sha-Aar of the Heavens but there are two other accounts of the origin
of this shrine (Gen. 35:6-8; 9-15). 26. The Phoenician account calls the brother of Usho (or Aes-av) Shame-Merum or "heaven-high," rendered Hypse-Uran-os by the Greeks, and he dwelt at Zor or "Tyre," learning to build "huts" or Such-oth; and
he quarreled with his brother Usho, who wore skins, worshipped fire and wind, and
built the first boat; but to both were erected
pillars at their death, which were worshipped.
Thus connected with Ma-Zeb-im or "obelisks," symbol of Amen-Raa or the "hidden-Sun," the
word Jakeb is reasonably found to mean in Egyptian "weeping," though it is "wine-vat" in Hebrew, and so the oak of Bach-uth at Beth
El (35:8) also suggests him as an aspect of
Bakch-os or Osiris. 27. The Sep-ed or "lamentation" at AtAd over la-Aakob, corresponding with Abel or "mourning" and Jakeb or "weeping," con
nects with the Egyptian concept Sep-ed, "lord
of the East," especially the war-Sun of the
town Kesen, evidently Mount Kasi-on, perhaps



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 293
''Gosh-en''; and Sep-ed is the name in Egyp
tian of the star Siri-us, the hehacal rising of
which heralded the Baa'^h or ''inundation."
Kes-em or ''Kasi-on" in the name Sep-ed, however, may supply us with the word Kesem
in Hebrew, rendered "witch-craft,'' "divina
tion"; but the determinative of a "sack" or
Kes (reverse in Hebrew is Sak, Gen. 42:27)
perhaps indicates that Kes-em was a place of
trade, and the place is still called El Kes. It
was at the east door of Egypt, near Aam or Pelusium, and Strabo found there a temple of
Zeus, evidently Amen or Sep-ed. The district
Sep-ed, of which Kesem was capital, has as
determinative of Sep-ed an acute cone or pillar, or sometimes a mummied "hawk" or Bak, a Sun-symbol, especially of Horus. Sep-ed is
full-bearded and a foreign god in origin ; in one
instance depicted as Bes, in others as "liftedup" on a Thes, which suggests the Greek "to set" from which These-us is supposed. Ja
Aakob's wife Ra'^hel is cited as weeping for children at Ram-ah, and in Egyptian "weep
ing" is Remi as well as Jakeb, and at this day
the site of Aamu or Pelusium is called PhaRam-eh. Howbeit, there need be little doubt that la-Aakob, carried off by a chariot and
horses from Egypt, is to be identified with
Egyptian and Phoenician theology.



SECTION IX
1. One can only understand the religions
of the ancients who knows that each town or
tribe had its own divinity or patron saint.
"According to the number of thy cities are thy
gods, O Judah!'' (Jere. 2:28; 11:13) was said
at least thirteen centuries after the time of
Abraham and nine centuries after Mosheh.
The statement was true of Canaan; it was
true of Egypt and Greece; it is true of every
nation to-day. It suited the heirarchy at Jeru
salem to deride these local deities, most of
whom differed only in name from Jehoah, and it was to their advantage to concentrate on
their town as a place of worship. These neighboring shrines were never abandoned, and even
thirty years after the Crucifixion the Emperor
Vespasian consulted that of Elijah at Carmel,
only a day's ride from Jerusalem. Odious
tales were told, however, of these rival places
and deities.
2. An example of this is the story of the Virgin of Mi-Zep-ah, perhaps called Than-oth or "lament (Judges 11:40), suggesting



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 295
Athen-a of Attica, and the Phoenician Tan-ith,
daughter of EL Though the story relates to
Mi-Zep-ah in Gileaad we may well suspect that
it equally applies to Mizepeh, an hour's ride
from Jerusalem, and the seat of government
for a time (Jere. 40:41) after Jerusalem fell. This latter (i Mac. 3:46) may be referred to
by the story of Rizepah, and is probably the
Gibeath of the Shaaul legend, I-Pheta^'h was
a Gibbor-'^Hail, and son of Gileaad and Aishah
Zonah or "woman harlot." He suffered the
usual indignities of young gods, and fled to the
land of Tob or "beauty" with certain Rek fellows ; and Mosheh also was a Tob or "beau
tiful-child," as was the "goodly" Sha-Aul, the
month Teb-eth giving to or getting name from the "ark" of Noa^i and the "basket" of infant
Mosheh; indicating their solar retreat in mid
winter, since, while the initial letter of the word
is different in Hebrew, it is probable that the
Egyptian Teba or "chest," "mummy-case,"
connects with their name Tebi for that of the same winter month when the Sun is in its ark
or its cradle, as also the Nile.
3. In his absence, Aammon oppresses, and
I-Pheta^'h returns to rescue Gileaad. He
swears that if successful he will sacrifice the
first object he meets that comes out of his



296 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
doors ; so he passes over, conquers ; then "came
I-Pheta'^h the Mi-Zep-ah to his house," when
his daughter, a virgin, comes forth, and be
comes the ''burnt-offering" or Aol-ah to
Jehoah. Aol Hterally means "what-goes-up," but so common was the burning of children as
a sacrifice by the Hebrews that the word also
means a "suckling" child, perhaps offered at
the going-up of the Sun or the rise of the Nile
but the peculiarity of this shrine was that per
haps virgins only were sacrificed. There was
a connection of this Mi-Zep-ah with the virgin
Mire-lam, perhaps, and certainly so if Ain
Mi-Shep-at was of like kind, for that was a name of her shrine at Kadesh Baren-Ea (Gen. 14:7) or "in Aren-Ea," which was in Pa-Aran; and the account in the Genesis indicates that there Aash-Tor-eth and Ta-Mar also had shrines ; Ta-Mar being both a Kadesh-ah and a Zan-ah in the account of her, but both words
are rendered "harlot," while Kadesh is usually "holy"; and Karana-im or "horns" as applied to Aash-Tor-eth indicates the Egyptian 'Ha-t^'Har or cow-goddess, or perhaps the newMoon phase of the Greek Diana, and "new-Moon" was ""Had-Esh in Hebrew, of which word Kad-Esh may be an idiom, as
Kadem-Esh means "eastern-light," while



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 297
Kadad-Esh means ''fire-worship/' perhaps in
the sense of vestal.
4. Mi-Shep-at, however, indicates the ferocious Shapu or Ta-Ur of the Egyptians,
pictured usually with a ''knife" (Demu or Mades in Egyptian), a Kadad or "cleave" in Hebrew, hence Tere-Dam-ah or "deep-sleep" w^ho fell on Adam and Abram, and gave them
posterity. There is a change of religion shown by the use of Kadesh as "sodomite" and
Kadeshah as "harlot" from the usual rendition of these words as "holy" and "holy-woman," and some distinction between Zan-ah and Kadesh-ah seems to have been preserved
(Deut. 23 :i7, 18) as in case of Judah's Tamar and it seems from the accounts of Lucian and others that the Syrian goddess had Kadesh-im of both sexes in her temples who prostituted
themselves for her treasury; the men being eunuchs who became catamites and went about with her image in their hands; hence, in the cited passages from the Deuteronomy, Kadesh in one verse and Chaleb or "dog" in the other
seem somewhat distinct; but Kadesh kept its
meaning as "holy," and Jerushalem is the
Kudes or "holy" of the Arabs to this day. A
similar case is that of C^al or "temple" and the
Egyptian word U^'hal or "dog" (compare the



298 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Hebrew word Achel or ''eat''), on which Egyptian word there is a play in Genesis* (43:32) and so I-Pheta'^h says "1 have opened my mouth
to Jehoah, and an Auchal to go-back/' that is, he would be a "dog'' to swallow his own utter
ance.
5. If I-Pheta^'h was a solar type, as was
perhaps Pata^'h at Memphis, he was a creator like Vulcan, that is, a "worker" or Maleach, but
mainly under-ground as the night-Sun, and,
when he arose to pass over, the astral concept might be that the watching Morning-Star must
pale in the glory of that victory over darkness and so Mi-Zep-ah is rendered ''watch," "watchtower"; but this might be the horned Moon
of morning as well if it were not that the star
continues for at least two months to fade away
after reaching its aphelion, that is, "to go down
on the mountains" and bewail her fate. The
Than-oth or "celebrate," "lament," of four
days for her probably indicates her name. In
Phoenician story Tanith is the daughter of El.
In Occidental myth A-Thena was the virgin
daughter of Zeus or Jupiter. The Persian
goddess was called Tanaita, and was symbol
ized by a star. The Greeks identified the
* "For not an Tu-Chel-un of an Egyptian to Ackel with the Hebrews."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 299
Phoenician Tanith with Ar-Tem-is, usually
typefied by the crescent Moon ; which Ar-Temis was a virgin, and twin of Apollo-Phoebus; and Ar-Tem was perhaps the Egyptian words
""Har-t-Maa or "goddess of Truth," whence the ''Har-Tum-im or "magicians" of Egypt and
Babylon encountered by Joseph and Mosheh and Daniel; though ''Har-Tem or -Atum was
a favorite name of the night-Sun, and Ar
Tem-is was probably his feminine as he was
specially lord of On or Helio-polis ; but it seems
easily that Tanith and the Greek Athena were
the Egyptian Nit or Ta-Nit, specially the name
of the goddess at Ssa or "Sais," at Esenah,
Thebes, &c., whose symbol was a shuttle, but who wears the Tesher or "red" crown. Shimesh-On went down to Timen-ath-ah, "for
Th-Oan-ah he sought from the Philistines," and (v. 7) she was "Tishar in the Aen-i of
Shimesh-On" follow^s; and so when Jehudah goes down to Timen-ath-ah he finds Tamar at
the Phetha^'h of Aena-im, and she makes a Buz or "shame" of him as Shimesh-On's wife
caused the like to him, for both seem the solar
strength overcome by the night-queen at the
horizon or sun-set; Ti-Men-ath perhaps being
Amen-ti. Ta-Anath Shiloh was doubtless a



300 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
shrine of this concept, while The-An-ah is
'^coitus" and "fig-leaf."
6. In the time of Strabo (17:1:46), that
is, of Augustus Csesar, a virgin was annually
prostituted to the god Amen at great Thebes, and Herodotus (1:181-1 82) found a like sacri
fice to Bel-Marduk at Babylon four centuries before; and, while both Amen-Raa and "Merodach'' were Sun types, as was perhaps
Molech on the Jordan, it is not necessary to
assume that the solar concept was alone charge
able with this species of offering. The words
Sep-ah, Zep-ah, and their derivatives, mean
"inundation'' (Job 14:19; Ezek. 32:6),
"spreading-out," "abundance,'' "increase,"
"covering"; and at Cairo the full Nile is still greeted with the cry "Wefa en Neel!" and
about the loth August all the functionaries
and people assemble to witness, amid joyous
shouts and the roar of artillery, the cutting of
the dam for the inundation ; at which moment a mud figure standing before the dam, and
called the "Bride of the Nile," is swept away before this "opener" or "mouth," which in both Egyptian and Hebrew is Pheta^'h; hence
I-Pheta^'h says "I have gaped my mouth
to Jehoah," which is a play on his name;
the "gaped" or Pez-ith being an idiom



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 301
of the hairy Buz, Jabez, the "beast-Hke,"
as Peta^'h at Memphis was identified with the
fire-god Hephaestos, and yet the reply of the maid, ''Do to me whatever ia-Zea from thy Pi," is a play on the word Pi-Zith-ah or
''gaped'' he has just used, or "going-from the
mouth'' of I-Pheta"h the Mi-Zep-ah or "inun
dation." In any case the mean origin ascribed
to I-Pheta'^h, like the drunkenness of Boaaz and of Noa^^h, seems meant to decry some
shrine.
7. In the hills of Judea it seems probable that Deity at one time was called Dad or David,
that is, "beloved." This was evidently the Egyptian name Dat or Dad, but spelled Tatt because their letters T and D were the same; and under such name it seems that Osiris w^as
represented in his phallic or amorous nature,
like Eros or Priapus, or in his productive and
earthly nature. The symbol called Dad or
Ded (Tat or Tet), usually construed as that of
"stability," or as the tree in which Asar's body
was enclosed, is more probably, what some
consider it, a phallic emblem, and also of the
resurrection of Asar; and it was set up with great reverence in Ba-en-Daddu or "Mendes" and perhaps other towns as such emblem of
his resurrection, while it was one of the two



302 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
figures placed in repeated order on the sarcoph
agi and the divine arks; the other figure
being the Ta, of looped shape, evidently fem
inine. Besides Mendes or Baendes, the city
Per-Asar (''place-of-Asar") or Busiris, was also called Ba-en-Dad, and hence perhaps the Bendidean orgies at Athens and in Thrace. Moreover, in upper Egypt were the two cities called Tet or Det and Teb-t or Deb-t, both
called Aprodite-polis by the Greeks, for the
name of the love-goddess is not taken from Greek words, but is a Phe-Raa-Dite or "handmaid-of-the-Sun,'' and Neter-Dit in Egypt was a "divine-handmaid" in the temples; yet Da-t
or "gift'' of Pha-Raa may be the meaning of A-Pha-Raa-Dite. Did-o or El-Issa, patronsaint of Kir-Thada or "Car-Thage," that is, "City of Did-o" or David-ah, was this goddess and her husband Sichar-Bas connects her with Isis as wife of Seker-Asar, and with David of
Je-Bus as his feminine; and that she sacrificed
herself in fear of lar-Bes, perhaps lehoah-Bes,
makes toward further study, since Bes is "fire"
in Egyptian, and was the hairy-god.
8. In Phoenicia Dud was son of II or
Il-Melech, but the legends that tell of the sac
rifice of his son call this son Shedid and Je-Did
and Je-Hud; Je-Did-Jah being the name of



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 303
Solomon ''in the Aabur of Jehoah" (2 Sam. 12:25) ; Jehud or Jehud-ah being the word we read as "Judah/' but perhaps also the Je-^'Hid or "only-one" offered by Abraham and by
I Pheta'^h, and the "darling'' of the Psalm (22:
20) ; ""Hat meaning "heart'' in Egyptian, hence
"darling" in Hebrew; so that Je-^'Hid or Je
Hud-ah and Dad or David mean much the same; and so Abraham and his le-^'Hid go to
the sacrifice of the latter, "they two la-^'Hed"
(Gen. 22:6, 8), that is, "as one," "in accord"; perhaps the Greek Agathe or "good" coming from ""Hat-a or "my heart" of the Egyptian. 9. There was a phase of Osar called Meru
or "beloved," with a lion following this name,
"lord of Philse," who might be suggestive of David, for the old shrine Beth-Le^'hem which
laid claim to David is seen to have had Naa
Ami or Mara as its mother-saint, and she was nurse of Aobed, son of Bo-Aaz or Bes, and Aobed suggests the great shrine Abyd-os. Ha-Dad or "the Beloved" was a divine name from Damascus to Edom, preceding the advent of the Persian name Mithras or the "Fond"
one ; both solar types, it seems ; appearing so in
the Bible story of the death of Ben-Hadad
when ""Hazah-El or the "sleep-God" puts the
wet Ma-Cheber or "from-glory" over the sick



304 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
man. That David in youth was A-Demon-i or "ruddy" seems to connect him with ^sav, who "came forth A-Demon-i, Hke a mantle of
Seair'' ; but it seems that David is made to de
stroy Edom, though he begot Ha-Dad there, and he, hke David, fled to Pa-Ran or the ser
pent-god Rannu for protection, and after
became a Satan or "adversary," as Suten
means "royal" in Egypt.
lo. Shaaul calls David Aalem or "strip
ling," a rendering so rare that the meaning of Aolem or "immortal" may suggest itself; but his son A-Besh-Alom has a name which might mean "shameful-youth." The Psalms are mostly "to David," not "of David" in any case.
His father was I-Shai, not "Jesse"; he seems to have had no mother; and he was youngest
of eight sons, thereby reminding us that in
Phoenician story Sadyk was father of the eight
Kabir-i, youngest of whom was Esh-Amun, in
whom the Greeks saw ^sekiel-Api-os. The
absence of much of the miraculous in the
stories of David* might leave one to suspect
he was a real personage, for, save the killing
of Gol-Jath and one or two other incidents,
there is little of the superhuman in his adven
*Yet the women sang that though Sha-Aul had slain his thousands, David had slain his ten thousands.

3o6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
tures; and the great rock called Gol-Gotha at
Jerushalem, to which place in Jebus-i times
David brought this Gol or "skull," was suffi
cient to suggest the giant legend. But that David was a name of Deity at ""Heberon and
Beth-Le^'hem and Jerushalem seems established by the infamous character given him by the
hierarchy of Jehoah, as they make of him a
bandit, a cruel murderer, a perjurer to Jona
than and to Shimei, the debaucher of AorJah's wife and his murderer, and they show
him a traitor at Gilboa, there calling him Sa
tan, and he died cursing his friend Joab; but, far more, he was descended from a Moabite woman name Ruth and the old hairy-god
Boaaz or Bes.
II. There are two accounts of the first
appearance of David ; in one of these the ferocious Shemu-El goes to Beth-Le^'hem at the order of Jehoah, and Shemu-El's monster appearance made the elders or wise-men ""Hered or ''tremble," it would seem; his present being
a ''heifer" or Ae-Gel-ath Beker, emblem of the
fecund Hathor or lo, if "heifer" is correct ; and
he there made David the Meshia'^h, whereupon
the Rua^'h of Jehoah came upon him, so that within a few verses more he is commended to
Shaaul as a Gibor ""Hail, a man of war, &c., and



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 307
was made armor-bearer to the king. From him by music David removed the evil spirit that Jehoah had put on Shaaul. The other
story, omitted by the Septuagint, is that his
father sent David with food for his brothers, and that he came to the Ma-Aegal-ah in the
vale of the El-ah, which might be ''heifer"
again as it is feminine singular, but Shaaul lay in the Ma-Aegal (i Sam. 26:5), hence it was
probably a circle or enclosure sacred to the
goddess ; but it was after he had slain the giant
that he met Shaaul for the first time. The sword of Gol-Jath was left at Nob-ah, and afterwards taken to Gath; but the head was taken to Jerushalem, though that town was still possessed by the Je-Bus-i. In another
place (2 Sam. 21:19; i Chr. 20:5) credit for
this exploit is given to El-^'Hanan, son of
Jaare-i-Oreg-im of ''Beth ha-Le^'ham-i," and
the "beam of weavers'' or Menor of Oreg-im
identifies the case yet confuses the names ; but
it seems probable that El-^'Hanan or "God-ofMercy" or "kindness-of-God" was a name of
David.
12. David incurs the displeasure of
Shaaul, and becomes a fugitive and a bandit.
During this period he attempts to rob Nab-al,
whose name means "wine-skin,'' who dwells in



3o8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Ma-Aon or "iniquity," and whose possessions
are in Oarmel, that is, he is a Priapus or 'Vineyard'' (C^arem)-El; and he was a Kash-eh or ''churHsh," and evil from Aalal-im or "drink
ing," and "he his ChaHb" or "he his dog," but
there is no word "house" in the sentence. Da
vid tells his messengers to "say thus to the
""Hai," which may be rendered "life" or it may be rendered "beast," and is probably designed
to identify Nabal with Bes, also in Egypt called
""Hai; but as Chalib he may in some sort be
identified with the old ''Heberon saint Chaleb, who brought the E-Shechol A-Neb-im or "cluster grapes" to the camp, and whose father's
name by reverse was ' "the A-Nup" or the "Anubis," though it may be hazardous to sug
gest that the shrine ''Heber-on and the Greek w^ord Kerber-os are from the same word, and yet the former name of the town was Kir Arabaa (Judges i:io), and Arabaa means
"all-fours" with a beast (Lev. 18:23).
13. The wife of Nabal is Abi-Gail, per
haps Hebe-Gail, who is beautiful and treacherous ; going secretly to the outlaw with food and
two Nibel-i of wine, and saying of her husband "Nabal his name and Nebal-ah with him," for Nabal is also rendered "fool." She
tells David that Jehoah will make him a house



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 309
of Ne-Aman, calls herself his Amath, &c.
whereupon he relented, blessed her, and lifted
up her face, not "accepted thy person/' His purpose had been, because Nabal neither knew
him nor w^ould give him cattle, to leave naught
that belonged to Nabal by the ''morning light''
or Ma-Shetin Bekir, usually read ''in Kir" or
"on a wall" as to the latter word, but Mashetin Bekir is changed to "man-child" in our Revised Version without apparent linguistic authority,
as the correct rendering seems to me to be that
of cutting off Nabal from "drink" (comp. Masheti of Dan. 1 15, 8), as his Ma-Shet-ah or "feast" ("banquet") proves, and as Shet or "water-skin" in Egyptian sustains, for Nabal
also means "wine-skin," which died when the
wine was out of it or him. David then sent for Abigail the C^armel-ah (not "to Carmel") and she became one of his harem, together with A^hi-Noaam from (not "of") I-Zerea-El.
Another version of this story locates it at I-Zerea-El, with Nab-oth or "grapes" of the C^arem or "vineyard" as the victim, in which
A'^heab and his wife Ai-Zebel were the robbers
and murderers, and the old C^armel deity Eli
Jahu was the judge; Bae'^ha being reverse of
A'^heab, Zerea-El meaning the "seed-God" or
"arm-of-God," &c. ; and to A^'heab or Bacche



310 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
us was said, as it was to Nabal, that ''shall be cut-off to A^heab Ma-Shetin Be-Kir" (i K.
21 :i2i) ; nor can it be unreasonable to suspect
that Ai-Zebel, before whom Eli-Jahu fled, was one from whom the Greeks and Latins derived
their word Sibyl. The story perhaps has its
foundation in the conflict with the sects which
were arrayed for and against the wine-god, and
of the orgies incident to his cult at C^armel and
elsewhere, as we see the mother of Shimeshon required not to use wine; and where Orpheus in Greece is destroyed by the Bacchanals, &c.
14. The book 2 Samuel elaborates the career of David. In the Chronicles the story
of Nabal or of Naboth, that of Aur-Jah ( i Chr.
20:1), as also that of Eli-Jah and A-Besh
Alom, are omitted, since their immoral ten
dency could not survive a period of extreme
barbarism and credulity. The story of the revolt of A-Besh-Alom is important as a seem
ing attempt to show the descent of David into Hades and his return, which was a popular
conceit among the ancients to attest the im
mortality and perhaps the solar nature of their
heroes. A-Besh means "evil" in ''Assyrian,''
"fire" in Egyptian if Bes is the same, but is
usually rendered "shame" in Hebrew, w^hile
Aalem is rendered "stripling" when Shaaul ap



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 311
plies the word to David ; and the name connects Abeshalom with the Aish-Bosh-eth and MephiBesh-eth of Shaaul's family. That Abeshalom
was solar appears from the assertion that he
cut his hair at the end of every year (2 Sam.
14 126) . David must then appear as the setting
Sun, at this stage, and that is somewhat the relation between Horus and Osiris, between Apollo and Pluto, for in Egyptian ritual we
find Tem-^'Heru-^huti or Tem and Horus men
tioned together. In this case the frequency of
the use and play on the word Aaber or ''pass
over," from his leaving and passing-over the
Aaber-oth or ''fords" till his return in the
Aaber-ah or "ferry-boat," was the first fact
that aroused my suspicion that this story is
adopted from the Egyptian conceit of the passage of the Sun (and of its votary when dead)
through the Duat or Hades in the Bar-is or boat in which all bodies of the good were
carried across the sacred lake, and the word
Aabera-im, perverted by our translators into "Hebrews," seems to me without doubt to have
been derived from this conceit and its ritual of
"passers-over" in the Aa-Bar-is or "great
boat"; the Exodus and its Pa-Sa^'h or "pass
over" being only another story of the same
religious concept, as I have averred.



312 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
15. David and the people first went and stood at the house of "the Mere^hak" or ''the
departed," and ''all his servants Aabera-im upon his hand/' and all the other bands Aabera
im before him; then the word Aaber or its
forms occurs six times in three consecutive
verses, 22-24, ^^^ he requests the Aron to be taken back to the city, saying he would "tarry
in the Aaber-oth of the Ma-Debar till there come a Debar from your people to the Gid to
me''; and Gid is not "certify," but is properly "sinew," and when Jakob was initiated the Gid of his thigh became sacred, though there seems
to be an esoteric meaning, as Jakob then saw
the morning Sun, or God face to face, at the
Aaber of the Jabbok, after he had Aaber his presents and his wives and children probably twice (Gen. 32:21-23); he remaining in Ma""Han-eh or "camp"; and when Jakob Aaber the stream and cried with ^sav, first "pros
trating" or Sheta'^h himself seven times, it is
seen that David also wept as he went up the mountain where Elohim was Sheta^'h-av-ah,
though he received presents while Jakob gave
them. David's Ba-'^Hur-im or "in Caves" is
the Pi-ha-^'Hir-oth or "mouth-of-the-Caves" of
the Exodus, as its Suc^-oth is the Suc^-oth of
Jakob when he came from ^'Har-an or "cave"



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 313
and it is here that David is accused by Shimeai, for when a corpse reached the sacred lake of the nome in Egypt the accusers came forward,
stated his crimes, and the judges who were
there passed upon the case, refusing to allow
the body to pass-over in the Baris if the charge
was proven; and the name of the lake at Memphis w^as Acherusa, which perhaps gave name to the Greek river Acheron and to the boatman Charon, but whether the Hebrew
word Sheta4i, "prostrate," ''worship," gave name to the classic Setyx or Styx is not so clear, though the Greeks had no S^; hence it was only when word came from the priests to David, ''lodge not the night in Aaber-oth of the Ma-Debar, but Aabor ta-Aabor," &c., the duplicate being emphasis. He tarries at Ma^Hana-im-ah, Jakob's "camp," which suggests the Egyptian boat ''Henn-u in which the Sun is
Seker or "shut-up," with its oryx-head for a prow, and which seems the Seair-ah to which ^sav went and the "whirlwind" that carried off Elijah and out of which Jehoah spoke to Job"^ ; but, as the name is feminine here, we may suspect the Egyptian serpent-goddess Ma'^hen,
* Seair is "whirlwind" whether the Sin or the Semach
is the initial letter, and Gesenius says the later Hebrew uses these letters without discrimination, and they seem to have the same sound precisely.



314 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
who seem-s to have guarded the tomb of Osiris or the Sun, as Rannu or Pa-Ran did young princes, and who seems also to have been called
''He'^h-t, the classic Hekate; so that David's
course recalls Chapter 131 of the Book of the
Dead, "I am the Sun god who shineth at night; * * * let me embark, O Sun, and let me sail in peace in thy boat to beautiful Amen-tet
let the god Tem speak to me; the lady, the
goddess, Me'^hen ^ ^ ^ dwelleth in NifUr-t" (near Abydos), &c. And so David was met by Shob-i the son of Na^'hash or "serpent" of Ma-Rab-oth of the sons of Aamon, by
Machir the son of Aami-El or ''with-god'' of
Lo-Debar or ''no-speech/' and by Barzelai the
Gileadi from Rogel-im or the ''iron-footed'^
Gileadi, who as father of Je-Pheta'^h was Petha^'h or Vulcan; this Shobi suggesting the Shebti images placed in the tombs of the Egyp
tians ; and these supplied David, "for the people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the MaDebar." 16. But A-Besh-Alom rode a Pered or "pard" or "leo-pard" which took him to the
Sobech of the great El-ah, as Sebak was the
crocodile-head god in Egypt, and the bad youth
was caught up by the head or hair in the El-ah,
and the Pered under him Aaber. Slain there.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 315
his corpse cast they ''in the forest, to the
Pe'^hath the great, and raised exceeding great round stones upon him," which seems to mean
he was cast into a Hon's den and a stone placed
over it as in case of Daniel, for Pe^hat is
"lioness" in Egyptian, and the lion figure was
a symbol of the Sun, while the stones "raised" or Zeb over A-Besh-Alom imply that he was worshipped, as does his "pillar" or Ma-Zeb-eth,
and there should be little doubt that he was
a type of Adonis, the sylvan phase of the vernal Sun, whose cult is thus meant to be explained away. His body was not honored by his grieving father as was that of Shaaul, nor was his murderer punished for that crime though
buried in the Madebar. 17. With all this David had to appeal to
the priests and elders, "Why are ye A'^heron
im to return the king to his house?" after which we read "And Aaber-ah the Aaber-ah to Aabir," rendered "and went-over a ferry
boat to bring-over," &c., and "Shemai fell before the king in his Aaber," for Sem-u was the
leader of the 72 conspirators against Osiris.
Finally "the king ia-Aabor the Gilgal-ah, and Chimeham Aabar with him, and all the people
of Jehudah ie-Aabir the king"; the Gilgal-ah
seeming a shrine of Gula the Chaldean wife of



3i6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the Sun, but perhaps in this case meant for the
''round" goddess herself, similar to la-Besh-ah
who received the dead Shaaul in the mystic Gile-Aad; and this shrine was where the alle
goric Exodus ended by passing-over Jordan
and observing Pa-Sa'^h or "pass-over" of the
Sun ; and the Gile-Aad of the returning Jakob,
and called father of I-Pheta'^h ; and so Aa-Galah and Abi-Gail of the wives of David. Mephi
Bosheth met David at his return, said he could
not follow the flight because of Pa-Sa'^h, and Mephi-Bosh-eth in Hebrew means ''Memphis
shame" as a reference to the lame Pa-Ta'^h or
*'Vulcan." The episode has its obscure points,
but seems on the whole an adaptation of the familiar myth of a passage into the Shades and a return therefrom, and this over the abyss of
waters in the divine barge or Baris, giving name probably to the Aabera-im or "Hebrews" as those who could do this.
1 8. The poetic repute of David arose per
haps like that of Apollo, since the Psalms are not "of" David but "to" David, and have no
reference to the events told of him. Their
titles are pure inventions so far as they seem
to concern him unless his is a name of Jehoah,
as "to the Beloved," though Jehoah seems con
sidered with little regard to terms of love and



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 317
tenderness, and the Psalms address him as a
saviour or helper or avenger, with the same
glorifications of him as in the hymns to the Sun
in Egyptian. The Greeks had conceits of the satyr-god Pan as a musician which connect
directly with the Egyptian presentations of the
hairy Bes with various instruments in his
hand, for the poets gave a comic turn to the
superstitious terrors of the vulgar; and yet
these instances apply rather to the giant Shaaul
than to David unless in that vicious maturity when he butchered the Ammonites, murdered Auri-Jah and the house of Shaaul, and died with ingratitude to Joab and perjury to Shimai,
&c. ; but as the lascivious Asar-Dad of Egypt, David must also be suspected of music and
song. 19. The time came, now, when David got no "^Ham or "heat"; though in Egyptian the word means "Egypt" and "wife." It was urged that a virgin be brought in order to Sechan-eth him, a word which has the double meaning "cherish" and "impoverish." They
searched the Ge-Bul of Israel; Bol in Coptic
meaning "over-flow," as Ma-Bol and A-Bel mean "flood" in Hebrew; and found Abi-Shag,
perhaps Hebe-Shag or "^Hapi-Shag, as ^Hapi
or the "Nile" must be the classic Hebe; and to



3i8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
her at last went Heracles, and to Pi-Sag-ah at last went Mosheh. She was a Shun-Amith, 'Vear-maid" or ''sleep-maid,"* and connects with the great woman Shun-Em w^hom EliShaa paid with a child for her "care" or
^'Harad, that is, ''Har-pa-'^Herad or the "child
god," who is ever pointing to his head (2 K.
4:19), and to whom the Pi-Shen or "lotus" was sacred. That this maid was quite sacred
did not appear to a ""Hittite like Bath-Shebaa,
but a request from Adoni-Jah the rightful heir to the crown that Abi-Shag be given to him in marriage was punished with death by Shelomeh. 20. David was buried in Air David or Kir-Dad. Years later, agreeable to our chronology, Did-o or David-ah was buried at KarThad-a or "Car-Thage," that is, Kir-Dad-a or Fortress of David-ah, and she was worshipped
there; her name El-Issa and the Bursa citadel
indicating that she was Isis and that the Busiris
or Per-Asir ("house of Osiris") was named for that city in Egypt which, as was Mendes
also, called Daddu or Tattu. And this David or Dod had the Homeric Od-Isse-us as his contemporary ; Dad-ben-Ishai or "son of Jesse" sounding quite like the name of the Greek ; and
* Shin was a name much used in Chaldea for the Moon.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 319
each seems to have descended into Hades, each
fights giants where stones are flung, each de
stroys those who seek his wife, each feigns
madness, &c. A royal Hne claimed their descent from David, a common resource of ancient dynasties, and perhaps all the Benai-Isera-El
claimed descent from or affiliation with Osir
El, since at death every good Egyptian became
an Osir-is.* 21. Shelomeh, not "Solomon," was also
called Je-Dide-Jah, "in the Aa-Bur of Jehoah." The word Shelom-eh is interpreted as "the
peaceful" in the Chronicles, but it is probably
a metathesis for ha-Moshel, "the ruler," "the
proverb"; and this seems explained in the
famous phrase of the Micah (5 :2, 5) where the
"Ruler" or Moshel shall (v. 5) be a Shelom or
"peace," and as "as of old"; for everything
about this personage became a mystery, even
his name, which is not explained as usual when given him by David.t But Jehoah "loved" or
Ahab him and sent the prophet to christen him
as Je-Dide-Jah or "Beloved-of-Jehoah," and this name would seem to ally him with amorous
*The word User in Egyptian means "strong." Compare Sar in Egyptian and Hebrew, "chief," "prince."
fFrom F. Lenormant we learn that Shaleman was a
name of the Chaldean god Ea or Hoa, the intellectual concept of Deity.



320 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Asar-Dad. But this name is only given him
''in the Aabur of Jehoah/' which, as we have pointed out, gives him a solar phase. He came
to his coronation riding a Pired-eth or leo
''pard,'' as Bered is ''leopard" in Syriac, "and
it went upon the Gi'hon" or "belly," not "to"
Gi'^hon, but Aal-Gi^'hon, and it is Aal-Gi^'hon
when Na'^hash was sentenced (Gen. 3 :i4) ; and thus Shelomeh connects with Bakchus. He
had 40,000 stalls for his horses, 1,000 wives
and concubines, 80,000 men to hew cedar in
Lebanon, made silver as common as stones in
the street and accounted as nothing, &c., &c.
Even the demi-urge of Tyre, ''Huram, the
Greek Herm-es, was his ''Her-esh or "car
penter," or "worker" in Na'^hash-eth or "ser
pent-lore," called (Num. 23:23) "enchant
ment"; but ''Heresh is perhaps the "secretcraftsman," for such was Herm-es, whose caduce-us (probably from Kadesh or "holy") was twined with serpents; hence there was no sound heard in the temple while it was build
ing; but Ne^'has in Egyptian means "black,"
while ^'Heresh in Chaldaic means "magician" *^Har-Rom in Egyptian meaning "divine-man" or "man-god." Shelomeh married Bath-Phar
aoh, which was the greatest alliance a Hebrew
could imagine ; and he built towns called Beith



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 321
''Horon, Tamar, Baal-ath, which are Egyptian
names ; but it seems quite probable that he was a type of Hor-us, who must have been wor
shipped at Jerushalem.
22. The older account (i K.), indeed,
perhaps to destroy the worship of him, as well
as to enforce Ezraic exclusiveness, says he worshipped A-Shetor-eth, and also Milach-Om Shik-Uz, and on Mount Olives he built temples to Chemosh Shik-Uz and Molech Shik-Uz, and
it would seem (i K. 11 : 3, 8) that he built to
the god of each of his seven hundred wives,
for he had all these and three hundred con
cubines besides; but this evidence of his in
fidelity to Jehoah is omitted by the Chronicler
where the dream of God's gift of a wise and "understand" (Neb-On and Shem-ea, i K. 3:
9, 12) is changed into an actual visit of God
to him (2 Chr. 1:7), who gives him wisdom and knowledge. The later times accredited him with many wise sayings, some in the form
of homilies, and because of his libidinous pro
pensity he has credit for writing the charming
and amorous Canticles ; while the 2 Chronicles
(8:2, 3) makes him also a conqueror, and has
it that the king of Tyre gives him cities, thus
reversing the older narrative (i K. 9:11-12),
which also raises up enemies to him, and lays



322 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
at his door the secession of the northern tribes. Wise and wealthy as he was, however, he left
no inscriptions or other stone witnesses of his name, as did the neighboring monarchs of the
Nile and the Euphrates. On the whole, per
haps, it would be safe to take him as the eponymous of Shalem or Jeru-Shalem, which was called Hiero-Solym-a by the Greeks at least as
early as the time of Herodotus, say B. C. 350. 22^. Shimesh-on, not "Samson," means a
little Sun, or the "On" is a word of endearment; Shemesh being the almost invariable word for the Sun. He is clearly Melach-Aareth
or "hairy-king" of Tyre, whom the Greeks adopted or appropriated as Herakles, perhaps the Egyptian ''Her-Akel or "Lion-God," usually called Shu or Shu-si-Raa, "Shu-son-of-theSun"; but in later or other Egyptian com
munities he was the hairy Bes or ''Hai, ap
parently Hebrew names. In classic story Herakles weaves at the feet of Om-Phale the daughter of Jordan-us, both Syrian names. The putative father of Shimesh-on was Ma
Noa^'h, the same as the name of the Flood-saint,
and identified with Boaaz or Bes when Naa
Ami asks Ruth (3:1) if she shall not seek
Ma-Noa'^h for her. An angel of "the Elohim,"
however, foretold Shimeshon to the mother



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 323
when she was alone, thus implying a celestial origin. When asked his own name this angel
said it was Peli-ei or "wondrous," a play on
le-Pel or "fell" in v. 20, as the "offering" or Mi-Ne'h-ah is a play on Ma-Noa'h; and NePhil-im were the "giants" of Noa'^h's time
(Gen. 6:4), or rather the "fallen," perhaps the
half-breed race or arch-angels; and so when Sarah laughs at the annunciation to her she is
told "the I-Pele a 'thing' {Dahar, "word")
from Jehoah" (Gen. 18:14), rendered "hard." His mother was forbidden to drink Jain and
Shechar, just as John Baptist was to drink no wine or Sekira (Luke 1:15); and no Moreh
or "razor" (also "rain," "fear") was to come on his head ; for he was to be a Nezir of Elohim, not "Nazirite unto Elohim"; Nezir meaning
"consecrate," "prince"; a religious sect (Num. 6
-.2, &c.), with which an effort is made to
identify Shimeshon because of his hair, for the
sect itself seem desirous to appear like Bes or
Melech-Aareth. 23. Shimeshon first went to Timen-ath-ah,
for he sought The-En-ah from the Philistines,
who "la-Sher-ah in my eyes," and one may see
that these terms play on the names of the goddess Te-Neha of Egypt and Asher-ah, both
having reference to the fecund "tree" or sym



324 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
bol, as T-Amen-ath-ah was perhaps her shrine, for Amen-t or t-Amen was the female Amen,
called Nei-th or th-Ne at Sais, which latter name is said to mean "weaver" ; and it was this
wife that he calls his Aa-Gal-ath, or "heifer."
After some exploits he retired to the rock of
^i-Tam, that is, the Egyptian sunset god Tum
or Atum; and thus perhaps closed the origi
nal story, which certainly closed with chapter
15.
24. To the shrine at Le^'hi, however, was
attached a legend that Shimeshon there killed
a thousand men with the Le'^hi of a ''Hamor or
"ass"* ; that Elohim then opened a fountain for
him, and he Meni or "drank," and it was called
Ain-Kore or "fountain-of-the-Quail." Le'^hi,
used for "green" in the next chapter (16:7, 8),
and Meni, not the usual word for "drank,"
suggest Alk-Mena the mother of Herakles,
also called Alkides, perhaps from El-Kadem-es
or "god-of-the-East," perhaps from Alk-os or
"strength," and to the Phoenician Herakles,
that is, Kadami-on or Melach-Aareth, quails,
were sacrificed. But La^'h-ah is rendered
"force" or "vigor" when applied to Mosheh
* cHam-Aor would literally mean "heat-light" or "Sunlight," and Le^hi is "shinings."



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 325
(Deut. 34:7),* and Beer-La'^hai-Roi was evi
dently a shrine of I-Shema-ea-El the Pe-Re or
"wild-ass/' that is, in Egyptian ''the Sun," as La^'h-ai Re-i would seem "my very bright Sun."
In Egyptian the word Le^'h-u is applied to a
couchant lion, hidden, with a serpent called
''Eye of Raa" over him (Ritual 17:133), and Isis is said to shake hair over his brow. The
ass,' in parts of Egypt, was a symbol of the
Sun, perhaps of the evil or hidden Sun, as it is
connected with Set the brother-foe of Osiris,
called by the Greeks "Typhon," the Zephon or
"hidden," or "North," of Hebrew; but in
Shimeshon's song one may perhaps reverse
""Hamor to Roma'^h or "spear," "dart," instead
of "heaps" or ""Hamor.
25. The gates of Aaz-ah were carried off,
then Shimeshon loves De-Lil-ah, or t-Lil-ah if
we use the Egyptian feminine definite article; and her name means "night" in Hebrew,
"fetterer" in Akkadian. She was induced to
secure from him the secret in which his great
''Hoch lay ; a word represented in Egyptian by
the phallus of a beast, and worn on the head of the god ''Hek, who seems to be the Nile-god
* "And not Nas La^h-ah," rendered "his natural force not
abated," seems "And not abated brightness," in reference to his eyes.



326 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
''Hapi or "Ap-is"; hence the Greek Hektor of Troy, and the Hades-queen Hek-ate, though the Egyptian word ''Hek also means "enchantment/' and ^'Hek-t was a name of the Hon
goddess Se^'het, also called Tefnut as Bas-t
ur Men-^'Hai, wife of Pata'^h or sister of Shu.
Shimeshon had seven ''locks" of hair or Ma-^'Heleph-oth which he told her to Areg or "weave" with the Ma-Sech-ath, rendered "web," but evidently some sort of "covering,"
perhaps the "booth" or "tent"; yet she only
enfeebled him by shearing his locks, or rays.
He was then blinded, and placed in the house of the Asir-im or "bound." When his hair
grew again his strength returned; whereupon he pulled down the temple of Dagon upon himself and thousands of his foes. He was buried between Zare-Aa-ah and Aesheta-Aol, which latter word seems to mean the "mighty
woman" ; but the locality of these events was that of Beith-Shemesh or "house of the Sun" (Josh. 15 no), a populous town (i Sam. 6:19), whose phase of Deity was reduced to somewhat
human limits by this story of him.
26. Jeho-Shu-Aa, whose shrine was Tim
en-ath-^'Heres (reverse, -Sere^'h), was son of
Nun or "fish," and Nin was a "fish"-god on
the Euphrates ; but in Egyptian the word Nun



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 327
means the ''sea," "waters." He is first found
fighting at Reph-Id-im or ''healer-of-hands^" where the lad-im of Mosheh were held
''steady" or Amen-ah, rightly "true," lest he
should play false, it might seem. Jeho-Shu-Aa and Chaleb were the only two of 600,000 men who left Egypt that were good enough to pass
over, for the one seems ^'Heres or "Horus,"
and the other was the ''dog" and son of ie
Pun-ha, or "the Anup-is," if we reverse it; both
being conductors of souls in the Ma-Debar or
"Silent" land, which conflicts with Mosheh or
Masheh as "weigher," for Anupis as well as Ta^'hut was thus called. The massacres com
mitted by Jeho-Shu-Aa, at the order of Jehoah, (comp. Judges 2:1-5), were the pencraft of Ezraic exclusiveness only (Deut. 20:16-18). This hero is accredited with the most remark
able of all miracles, the stoppage of the "Sun" or Shemesh and the Moon for a whole day, but
this was at Beith-'^Horon or "house of Hor-us"
or ''Haron, and in Egypt these objects were
called the eyes of Horus; but at the same place Makkabeus defeated Saron and Nikanor without such help. It may be that Jeho-ShuAa was the Zer-Oa Natu-ah or "arm out
stretched," or the Zere-Aa-ah or "hornet,"
that was to go before the Israelites (Ex. 6:6;



328 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
23:28), or perhaps the Maleach or "angel'' that was to do this. The god Shu or Shua in
Egypt is said to mean 'light" as distinct from the Sun, and some have assumed that he was the Herakles of whom Herodotus speaks there. His name Aa-Aor certainly is like the Hebrew
word Aor or ''light"; and he restrained the
fury of the goddess Aor-t, a name of Se^het.
He was also ""Har-Seket or "God in the divine
barge." The inscriptions say of Shu that "his
substance is the substance of the Sun"; his
nutriment, first-born, selected before his birth,
and without a mother ; "divine substance, self
created." Shua wears sometimes the ""Hek or
beast-phallus, emblem of valor, and is always
Shu-sa-Raa or "Shu-son-of-the-Sun" ; this latter reminding us of Si-se-Ra whom la-Ael
covered "in Semich-ah," not elsewhere ren
dered "rug," but "repose" or "rest," as the Egyptian word Sem meant Sun-set and the
West. It seems that Shua occupies to Raa or
the "Sun" the relation that "Har or "Horus"
occupies to "Osiris," while Jeho-Shu-Aa with
his shrine Timen-ath-^'Heres has combined the two concepts, which would appear in Greek
as Herakles and Apollo-Loxias, in Hebrew as Shimeshon and Jeho-Shu-Aa, the power and
beauty of Light.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 329
2^. No individual crimes are attributed to Jeho-Shu-Aa, from which one may infer that his shrine at Timenath-^'Heres had disappeared
before Ezraic times, though the fate of Si-se-ra
of ""Harosh-eth is suggestive; but the Isaiah
(19:18) seems to allude favorably to Kir
^'Heres or City of Horns'' in Egypt, while it
suggests perhaps the story of the Exodus in
verse 20, where it is said that a Mo-Shi-Aa
shall be sent, &c., thus coupling Mosheh and Jeho-Shu-Aa; and yet the wife of Shimeshon
enabled his foes to explain his riddle on the
seventh day at the coming in of the ''Hares-ah,
and the gate of the ^'Hares-ith was close to the
dreadful valley of the son of Hinnom (Jere.
19:2), at the west of Jerushalem.
28. Eli-Jahu is quite the ideal of Jah or
Jehoah, though he was a hairy saint like Bes and Shimeshon. Tacitus and Suetonius call
him Carmel-us, for his shrine was an oracle on Mount Channel many years after Christ, and
when consulted by Vespasian there was there
neither temple nor altar, and the priest was called Basil or "King," suggesting Malach
Aareth or the "skin-king" of Tyre. C^arem-El,
however, is "vineyard-god," and it seems prob
able that from the Phoenician voyagers the
Greeks built up their concept of the orchard



330 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
saint Priapus on this model of the hairy EH
Jahu, for Pa-Arep or ''the Wine" is the Egyptian word which gives us the name Priap-us; and this seems supported by the fact that the chief shrine of this concept was Lampsak-os on the Marmora, near Abydos, which was probably Elohim-Pasa'^h or "God-of-the-Pass
over," while Abyd-os is clearly called for the Egyptian city of that name, and most famous shrine of Osiris; hence Nab-al of C^armel, whose wife was Abi-Gail, was perhaps Neb-El or "grape-god" in Hebrew, and the story prob
ably an attack on the cult of Eli-Jahu. 29. The main story suddenly announces
that Eli-Jahu threatens a drouth; giving no
ancestry or youth-history of him; calling him
"the Ti-Sheb-i from T-Sheb-i of Gilead" ; but
that one of these words is reversed may appear from the Septuagint which has "from Tisheb
eh of Gilead," as "the Besh-eth" or Bes, the
old Cancanite god, is thus indicated very
plainly; but the preceding verse strengthens
this opinion, for it is there stated that ''Hi-El
of "house of the gods" (Beith ha-Eli) built
Jeri^'hoh, and with bloody rites, and we learn
from Egyptian inscriptions that ''Hi and Bes
are the same; hence it may be that the first
words of Eli-Jahu to A^heab, ""Hai-Jehoah,



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 331
God of Israel, which we standeth before him,
if there shall be dew," &c., are an allusion to
somewhat else than the ''liveth" Jehoah. His further name of Aish Ba-Aal Seaar (2 K. 8),
"man-god-hairy," as well as his Addereth or
"mantle," identify him with Bes or '^Hai, also called .'^.sav, who was like an Addereth Seaar
when born, and disappears in Seair-ah, as Eli
Jahu vanishes in the Seaar-ah or goat-barge of the Sun; but to call him Ba-Aal would not
necessarily identify him with that concept of
divinity; while to identify him with ^-Sav or
Edom we find the connection to be with the
classic Pan, whose name apparently comes from the Egyptian Pa-Aan or "the dog-head Ape," though when Jakob passed over Penu-El he met ^-Sav "whose Pani was as the Pani of an Elohim," but whose legs were perhaps
beast-like, and the name of the god Pan may be from a Hebrew-word. The name of King
A'^heab, and that of ia-Aakob, reversed, is
respectively Bae'^ha and Bokaa-ai, suggesting
the vine-god; hence the story of Nab-oth or
"grapes" and of the robbed Laban, whose re
verse name is Nabal or "wine-skin" ; and both
Nabal and Laban lost their women, for lakob
and David are perhaps varieties of the same



332 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
concept, as Sha-Aul in Gibeah was of ^sav
in Edom, Eli-Jahu at C^armel, &c. 30. At Athens we find that Theseus was son of ^ga-os or the "goat," who threw himself into the sea at the approach of his son
from the East, as ^sav retired to Seair-ah
when his "perfect'' or Tham brother arrives
from "^Haran or the "cave'' of the East; and
the Egyptian word ^'Hag or "goat" gives us y^ge-os and the Hebrew word ""Hag for "fes
tival," "feast," even to the solemn observances for the goat-fish was the Zodiac sign at Babylon and at Dendera for the tenth month, De
cember, called Tybi on the Euphrates, on the
Jordan, as on the Nile; wherefore the Teb-ah
or "ark" of the solar Noa^'h and of the new
born Mosheh. All these instances indicate the
Sun in Capri-Cornu, as well as its re-birth as Theseus, Ja-Aakob, Mosheh, &c. Yet the Seair-im or "goats" were a symbol of some sort
of Deity among the Israelites (Lev. 17:7; 2
Chron. 11:15), as in Egypt. Eli-Jahu must have been supposed to wear a goat skin, as his Addereth Seaire implies, and so doubt the
priests at C^armel who kept his shrine.
31. Eli-Jahu could raise the dead to Hfe.
He could draw fire from the skies, as seen at
his contest with the priests of Ba-Aal. These



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 333
priests, to the number of 450 he murdered, for the Ten Commandments were written after his time. With all this power, however, he fled
before the wrath of the puissant Ai-Zebel, whose name sounds like ''Sibyl" as the Greeks and Romans had it. He went to the Ma-Debar, and there an angel ministered to him as the
ravens had done before. Then at ''Horeb, a "mountain of the Elohim," earthquake and whirlwind precede the passing-by of Jehoah; and he then appears in a Kol Daman-ah Dak
ah or ''voice still small," though the words
suggest the Kol Dama or "voice of blood" of Kain (Gen. 4:10) and the A-Kel Dama of
Iskariot, in which case the voice may refer to
the butchery of the Ba-Aal-im or to the further bloody orders as to Ben Hadad murder and
that of Ai-Zebel, &c., that is, the vengeance
to be inflicted on those who committed the
crimes set out in v. 14; and so the A-Kel Dama
of Kain and Iskariot were for their slaying
the prophets. Eli-Jahu, however, is notified, as was Mosheh, that he was not himself to
execute these sentences, and the name of his
successor Eli-Shaa is that of Jeho-Shuaa the
successor of Mosheh who finished his work;
the ""Horeb scene being a rival or duplication
of that of the theophany at Sin-ai ; even Jehue



334 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the son of Ni-Meshi or Jeho-Sephat thus groups the names of EH-Jahu and Mosheh and the father of EH-Shaa; nor can we ignore the statement that Jehue also came from Gileaad and that he too slaughtered the Ba-Aal-im, for
Eli-Jahu was the ti-Sheb-i or "returner," and
it seems possible that Jehue was a person
deified as Eli-Jahu, or that the story illustrates
the return of the saint in his chariot of fire and
horses of fire, as Je-Hue is a play on the words
Jahu and Hue or ''he," possibly identifying them with each other and with the Fire-God or
the Sun ; and it is notable that Je-Hue, .when
he arrives at le-Zereae-El, first goes to the
portion of Nab-oth or "grapes," whose C^arem had been taken from him, and he murdered.
32. The characteristics of Mosheh and
Eli-Jahu, as of Jeho-Shuaa and Eli-Shuaa, are
quite different, since Eli-Jahu was in no way a
law-giver ; hence it must be that his priests at C'armel prepared the theophany at ""Horeb
and his ascension into Heaven as a counter
poise to the similar stories of Mosheh, though
they may be the original story; and so in his
return as Je-Hue the career of Jeho-Shuaa as
a destroyer is imitated; while in its turn the
writer of the Matthew seems to have availed
himself of the phenomena at ^'Horeb to render



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 335
more lively the events at the Crucifixion, for
at that period the shrine at C^armel was the
most famous in Palestine, John Baptist was
an imitator, and the "return" of the Ti-Sheb-i was expected; but both he and Mosheh appear
as ministering to Jesus at what is called the
Transfiguration, recorded in the three first
gospels.
2,2f' Eli-Jahu appears again as a foe of Ba-Aal Zebub, the name of Deity at ^keron, the Acheron of the Septuagint; and the hairy
Ba-Aal calls down fire to destroy platoons of
soldiers sent to arrest him; then sentences the
king to death. "And it came to pass, in the
going-up of Jehoah, Eli-Jahu in the Sa-aar-ah of the Heavens," is the curious reading that follows, "and went Eli-Jahu and Eli-Shaa from the Gilgal"; nor can "in the Aaloth Jehoah" be stretched into "when Jehoah would take up by" ; for in v. 1 1 we have "and ia-Aal
El-Jahu in the Saar-ah"; so that I would un
derstand the first verse to read that Eli-Jahu
ascended as Jehoah ascends, since "the Gilgal"
is also rendered "wheel," "whirlwind," and
perhaps we are to understand a circular motion
that keeps him in view. Of the Saar-ah or
"goat"-barge of the Sun in Capri-Cornu I
have spoken. Eli-Jahu and his successor



336 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
"passed-over" (ia-Aaber) Jordan ''in ''Horeb
ah/' rendered ''dry-ground/' and the equivalent
of la-Bish-ah which received the body of
Shaaul. A search of three days failed to find
Eli-Jahu. 34. Eli-Shaa, on whom fell the Addereth
or ''mantle/' is allowed a father, name Shaphat or "judge." Eli-Shaa means "Saviour-God/'
He is probably a phase of the cultus of Jeho
Shuaa, or that of Shua or "light'' in Egypt;
hence is mild and beneficent, and the ante-type
of Jesus as Eli-Jahu is of John Baptist. His first
miracle was to heal the water at Jeri'^ho, which caused the land to "miscarry" or Me-Shachaleth, or rather "from bearing" (grapes), for
Shachal or E-Shechol is "cluster," and "grape"
or "vine" in Ethiopic; and so in the first miracle
of Jesus at Cana the water is changed into
wine, which was a reversal of Eli-Shaa's mi
racle. The gift of a son to the great woman of Shun-Em or the "year-mother" seems an
Egyptian story, as she is thus endowed as one
who '"^Harad-at for us with all this ^Harad-ah"
or "careful for us with all this care"; thus
indicating the child-god ^'Herad or ^'Har-pa
^'Herad, known to the Greeks as Harpocrates, whose emblem the Shen or "lotus" was also
that of Spring or the resurrection of nature;



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 337
and ''Harad is usually seated on a lotus or
Shen, and with a hand pointing to his lips, or
''head'' (2 K. 4:19) as we have it; and at his death Eli-Shaa went in and shut the door on
the two, then raised the child to life when he
Je-Gehar or ''stretched" upon it; and yet the author of the Mark has perhaps changed Jegehar into the Greek Jair-us and the dead
child to a girl that Jesus says is asleep, for
Shen is "sleep" as well as "year"; while
"double-portion" or Pi-Shena-im, asked of
Eli-jahu by Eli-Shaa is "the Lotus" in Egypt
tian, and the Bisheen of Arabs to this day.
Eli-Shaa also anticipates Jesus by feeding
many with scant fare (2 K. 4:42-44), but the
John (5:3) is the only gospel which locates
this miracle on a mountain, as if appreciating
Eli-Shaa's C^armel or "fresh-ears-of-corn."
He cured an army of blind men at one time. It does not appear that he could walk on water,
but he parted the river with the mantle and
made iron swim. Like his predecessor, he made oil for a widow, and he rendered whole
some poisoned pottage. He cured the leper
Na-Aman by requiring him to bathe in the
Joredan, and transfer the leprosy to his own
servant. He changed the dynasty at Shomeron
by sending to Gileaad for Je-Hue, who de
22



338 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
stroyed the numerous brood of A'^heab and
Ai-Zebel, and all the priests of Ba-Aal; but, as
stated, this illustrates a return of Ti-Sheb-i or
the "returner," upon whom le-Zerea-El or the
seed-god was to be avenged (Hosea 1:4, 11;
2:22). 35. A majority of the miracles of Jesus were adapted from those of Eli-Shaa, but no
one has hitherto seen that the raising of Lazar
us is a paraphrase of the Ma-Sha^'h-ete of
""Haza-El at Damascus, which Eli-Jahu had
been told to do (i K. 19:15); and this word "anoint" also means "corrupt," "destroy";
wherefore Eli-Shaa wept (2 K. 8:12) ; but in
telling Eli-Jahu to "anoint" Jehue, v. 16 of the
former text, the word is ti-Mesha^'h or a re
versal of the terminal, which is never rendered
"corrupt," "destruction," for Eli-Jahu was the
fugitive fore-runner of these Mesia'^hs; but •"Haza-El, meaning "to see God" or "fastened God," is Grecized into L-Azar-us, which is not more violent than Jesus from Jeho-Shuaa or
Eli-Shaa, or after we concede the reversal of the El;"^ and that Ben-Hadad or "son of David" in turn takes the Ma-Chebar or "cloth"
off the face of ''Haza-El or L-Azar-us, while
* Compare Eliam or Amiel; Jeho-Achaz and Achaz-Iah; this latter being also names separately of the sons of A<^heab and Jehue.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 339
the "Saviour" weeps, accords in the two
stories, as does the ''corrupt" condition of the
corpse of Lazarus, and the prediction of Eli
Shaa and of the Jewish council (John 11 148 ).
36. The only stain on Eli-Shaa is where forty-two children are cursed by him and eaten
by Dub-im or ''bears" for calling him Kerea^'h
or "bald-head," probably "mourner" as grieving persons shaved the head; and yet the
number of children is the same as that of the forty-two judges of the dead in Egypt who
heard the accusations against him before the
corpse was permitted to pass-over in the sacred
Bari, and this incident may connect with the
previous verse 17 where it seems Eli-Shaa was
suspected of violence to Eli-Jahu and was Bosh or "ashamed"; and so Jehue slew the forty-two
brothers of A^'haz-Jahu at the Bor of the house of the "bound" or Aekad. No claim is advanced
that Eli-Shaa arose from the dead, but his bones gave life to a man who had died. It is
notable that it is not said where he was buried.
It is barely possible, while he may be easily
a phase of Jeho-Shuaa, or rather Jeho-Shuaa
of him, that the sublime poems entitled
"Isaiah," correctly le-Shaae-Jehu, are to be as
sociated with this concept, as all three names
are the same if we make Jahu and El the same



340 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the meaning in Hebrew being ''divine-deliv
erer" or saviour; and the exploit ascribed to
le-Shaae-Jahu, that of turning back the "dial" or Ma-Aal-oth of A^'haz, seems of a kind with the thaumaturgy of the other two of the name and that they are introduced on the stage as
living in times apart is only evidence that the
cultus lasted for some centuries.
37. The Chronicles were perhaps written
a century before the Christian era^ and there is in them no mention of Eli-Shaa and only once do we hear of Eli-Jahu. The omission of the
rebellion of A-Besh-Alom may be due to rever
ence for David or to the allegoric nature of it
herein pointed out ; but that the accounts of the
two saints should be omitted must be due to the continued worship of them, as we know was
the case of Eli-Jahu long after the time of
Jesus. The old hairy god is noticed in two or
three of the prophetic books, and appears in
the gospels ; John Baptist being an imitator, as
doubtless there were others; nor is it improb
able that the Sun-god at Emesa on the Orontes, Elija-Ga-Baal, who gave name to Emperor Elagabalus, was a Greek corruption of the
name Eli-Jah-Ba-Aal,* two centuries after
* Guizot, in annotation of Gibbon, endorses Gibel as Hebrew for "mountain" in this name, and Gibbon's note en



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 341
Jesus. But of Eli-Shaa, save Jonathan the
most perfect figure drawn in Hebrew Hterature, we have no recognition by such name
apart from the single original narrative except
once (Luke 4:27), though the miracles of
Jesus are plainly imitative of the ""Hor-Esh (rendered "who - was - plowing - with" !) or
"workman," that is, "carpenter." The fierce
Eli-Jahu, archetype of zeal and intolerance, is
better adapted to the concepts of a narrow and
barbarous ecclesiasticism. It may be that in
this duality we have the personification of the
Sun and the Moon, but more probably Fire
and Light. 38. Shemu-El, rendered "Samuel," may have been a real person since only one or two
miracles are assigned to him; and he occupies
much the same territory as Eli-Jahu, but was
perhaps the local phase of the divine at Ramathah. The word Shem means "name" or "famous" ; Shema-im is the "Heavens," always plural; Shem-Aa is "hear," but I-Shem-Aa-El the son of Hagar was perhaps Egyptian for
dorses the Syrian word Gatx)! or "to form;" but Gibel is not "mountain" in Hebrew, only in Arabic, which latter could hardly have prevailed at that time. The contemporary Herodian gives the name as Elaja-Ga-Bal-os if we allow J for I,
and this would be in Hebrew "Eli-Jah the exalted Ba-Aal," and the conic symbol on his coin would perhaps indicate the meridian Sun.



342 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Shem, ''to go," and Aa, "great," ''great nomad" god. Shemu-El is said to have been
named because his mother She-El-et or "asked"
for him, and (i Sam. 1 127-28) she says Jehoah had given her her She-El-eth which she ShaAl-et with him, "and also i-She-Eil-et him to
Jehoah; all the years which he may live he is Sha-Aul to Jehoah"; the last "granted" being the precise name we have as "Saul" the king;
so that it must seem that the effort of the
writer is to identify Shemu-El with King ShaAul, and hence with She-Eol or the underworld, of which Sem was a name in Egypt, as
Sem was there the high-priest of the leopard
skin, and also a name of the hot season of the year, such as the Arab month Shawwal or
August; and yet the Sha or figure of evil was
in Egypt the ass-jackal, used to indicate SetNebat of the long ears, with whom w^e may connect I-Sheme-Ae-El the "wild-ass" if not
Shemu-El, as Semu was chief of the seventy
two conspirators of Set when he "shut-up" or
Seker Osar. Howbeit, the putative father of
Shemu-El was El-Kan-ah, and he dwelt in
Har Ephe-Ra-im or "hill of mad-visions." One
of his wives, ^'Hann-ah, whose name means
"favor" in Hebrew and "prophetess" in Egyp
tian, had no child, as she was Sagar or "shut



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 343
up'' by Jehoah, doubtless as a vestal; and only
the priests perhaps could give her ''seed of
man." The priest at Shiloh was the aged Aeli, whose sons debauched the Zabeoth in the
temple, and the father told his sons it was no good reports he heard "from the Aaber-im (or Hebrew) people of Jehoah/' or "pass-over"
people, but Aabera-im is not "ye make to trans
gress" (i Sam. 2:24). This scandal does not
deter ""Hannah, and thus Shemu-El has a
priestly origin. Jehoah sent word to Aeli that
his house should be cut off, and that a Ne
Amen or "faithful" priest should be raised up
who should walk before Jehoah's Meshia'^h for
years, while the survivors of Aeli's house should beg bread of Shemu-El, and say "Add
me, now, to the sisters, the priestesses," or
Cohen-oth, not "priests' offices."
40. While the youth slept in the temple
Jehoah "came and stood" there, talking of
Aeli's rejection. 41. Shemu-El persuaded his people to put aside the Ba-Aal-im and the Aash-Ter-oth,
and to serve Jehoah only ; wherefore, when the
Philistines attacked the Israeli the offering by Shemu-El of a lamb caused Jehoah to thunder
upon and discomfit the foe. He judged Israel
at Beth-El and the Gilgal and the Mi-Zep-ah,



344 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
as well as at the Ramath-ah where he dwelt; which is perhaps to say that his shrines were
at these places. The original account of him seems to end with Chapter 7. The story of Sha-Aul follows, and hence Shemu-El does
not seem to have judged Israel all his life.
His sons, made judges by him, followed the Bez-Aa, &c., by which I understand Bes or the old Cananite god; whereon Sha-Aul is made Malach and Me-Shia"h. The Ezraite hierarchy, averse to secular government, con
tinue Shemu-El as the priestly foe of the king,
his censor and superior; and he is deposed be
cause he officiated at a sacrifice to Jehoah which
the priest thought he alone should offer. Then
comes the horrible order of Shemu-El against
Aam-Aleq, followed by the hewing in pieces of their king by Shemu-El; but, as Agag or Igig means an arch-angel or arch-dsemon in
the religious system of Chaldea, and the
Gigans or "giants'' of the Greeks, it is perhaps safe to remand Agag and Gog and Og to the
nursery stories. Shemu-El at last anoints David as Malach and Meshia^'h, for the papacy was then at Ramath-ah. It is there the old
hierophant was said to have been buried; but,
fifteen hundred years after his supposed era,
in the reign of Emperor Arcadius, his bones,



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 345
no doubt having resisted decay, were borne in pompous procession to Constantinople, amid the
devout rejoicings of the Christians of that day,
and doubtless the silent derision of all sensible men. After death, however, when Sha-Aul inquired his own fate of a Ba-Aal-ath Aob or
"familiar spirit," rather ''divine purifier,"*
who dwelt at the Fountain of Dor, Shemu-El,
at the bidding of the Sibyl, arose a God from
the Earth ; and he tells the king that tomorrow
he and his sons "will be with me." When the
Sibyl saw it was Shemu-El who appeared, she
at once recognized Sha-Aul, saying "Why exalteth me, and thou Sha-Aul?" which might
refer to the conceit expressed when Jehoah
said to Aeli that he would raise up a priest
of Ne-Amen who should go before his Me
Shia^'h all the days, as Eli-Jahu in later times
was to precede Me-Shia'^h; hence Shemu-El
seems the double of Sha-Aul, like the Chaldean
Sukal and the Egyptian U-Shab-ti or "work
*Ab was the priest in Egypt who poured water in the religious ceremonies. For this purpose he carried a "bottle," Aob in Hebrew, called ^Hes, which is Greek for "Isis ;" hence Shemu-El as ^Hoz-ah or "seer," unless he was the Egyptian cHesi or "bard," the Greek Hesi-od, which is more probable. From Pa-Ab or "the purifier" comes the Greek word Bap-tae, applied to the priests of the goddess Kot-is. Ba-Aal-ath is
rendered "mistress" when applied to the great woman of Shun-Em, but God-like or divine is the proper rendering there as here.



346 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
man" of Hades, like the Ooresh or "toiler" of
Jehoah (Isaiah 44:28), but refined into the
soul or conscience of a man, or the Daemon
of Socrates; perhaps expressed by the EliAezer Dam-Ma-Sek of Abram, which may be
read ''my divine-helper and familiar," as Mesek means a ''runner" or "messenger," and so the Kol Dam-ah of Eli-Jahu and Kain and Iscariot
may be read "still voice" as well as "voice
familiar" or "voice of blood." 42. Coming from somewhat the same field
as Eli-Jahu, though in a different time and by
a different author, it may be that Shemu-El
and Eli-Jahu are variants of the old Deity of
lower Syria, and the shrines of "the Ramath
ah," "the Gilgal," "the Mi-Zep-ath-ah," Beth
El or Laz, all indicate by name the worship of a feminine concept of Deity, as Laz was wife of Nergal the Assyrian lord of war and death. Gilgal-ah is perhaps Gula the wife of Shemash or the Sun, Ramath-ath seems a form of the inundator-god Ramman, Mi-Zep-ah is appar
ently the feminine of the rain-god; hence we
find Shemu-El and Eli-Jahu calling down rain
and fire and thunder, ordering drouth, depos
ing or anointing kings, rising up from death,
vanishing in a Seair-ah, &c., while Beth-El,
Gilgal-ah, and Mizep-ah became distinctive for



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 347
sinful worship (Amos 5:5; Hosea 4:15; 5:1), and Ramith is rendered "deceive."
42^. Shemu-El is little noticed in the
Scriptures, old or new; once in the Jeremiah, once in the Psalms, completing the list in the Old Testament, both times in connection with Mosheh, the reverse of whose name, ha-Shemx or ''the Name," may have occurred to the
Psalmist (99:6). One cannot fail to note that the shrine Ram-ath-ah or Ram-ah is Hebrew feminine for the Egyptian word Rom or "man," and possibly for Ran or "name," for when Shemu-El dies David goes to Pa-Ran, which is Egyptian for "the Name," as well as for the serpent goddess Ran-nu; and Pa-Ran or rather Pa-Aran was w^here I-Shema-Aa-El dwelt, of whom the correct reading says (Gen. 21 :2o) "and a God was the youth," for the word "with" is not there.
43. Scholars tell us of the Phoenician and
Syrian deity Samma-El, god of war and death, who thus approaches Nerugal, and who was also called Shomeron, which is the correct
word for "Samar-ia"; and they also tell of Shamela who was an Assyrian deity; indeed,
seven centuries after Christ the people of
'^Hauran on the upper Euphrates considered
Shemal, chief of the Genii, at the head of their



348 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
pantheon, as El-Shadai or ''God of Genii" was at one period worshipped by the patriarchs who are said to have come from the Euphrates. That Shemu-El was reduced by the Jewish author from a high place to become a judge
and a seer in the district north of Jerushalem
seems probable, and it is possible that he is the A-Shim-e made a god by the colonists from
^Hamath (2 K. 17:30). His sons, vicious as were the idolatrous descendants of Mosheh, by becoming judges in Beer-Sheb-aa, where Hagar wandered with I-Shema-Ae-El, supply
further support to the supposition that the seer and the archer were local variants of the same
concept ; but it may be strongly suspected that the "wild-ass" of Pa-Aran was the Egyptian evil-being Set or Nub-ti of the long ears, and who seems that Neb-at who was father of the bad Jeroboaam. 44. Sha-Aul, rendered ''Saul," seems the
name of the tutelary deity of Gibe-Ath, some
four miles north of Jerushalem; Gib-aa and Gib-ah meaning "height," "elevation"; ShaAul being Gib-ah than his fellows from his
shoulders upward; and this Gibe-Ath of ShaAul seems called Gibe-Ath of the God ( i Sam.
10:5) ; but bad stories were told of the place
(Judges 19: —20:) since its sanctity made it



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 349
a rival of Jerushalem, and we are even told
that the town was taken and destroyed, to
gether with all the Binjamin-i, not long before
the time of Sha-Aul; nevertheless he was of
that destroyed tribe. His name probably means "Fire-God" or Esh-El, as is explained by his burial beneath the Esh-El in Ja-Bish-ah
or ^'drouth"; and yet the title Ushi-Gal or "ogre" assumed by an Assyrian monarch, which Lenormant says is Accadian for "excep
tionally great," equivalent to the Assyrian
word Basham or "excellent," is possibly the
correct origin of the name, especially as She
Gal in Hebrew is rendered "ravish" as well as "queen," and G in Hebrew softens at
times into Aa; and the like origins suggest
themselves for She-01 or "Hades"; the Ur or Ul of Egyptian also meaning "mighty"; but both the words Sha-Aul and She-01 appear in
Hebrew as "ask," "petition," "grant," as (i
Sam. 8:10) "the people the Sho-Al-im from
him a Malech."
45. Sha-Aul was son of Kish, but de
scended from Aphia^'h or "breath."* as Kish
is "bow"; but as Shual means "fox," emblem in Egypt of Anup and of the "grave" or Sheol,
* Compare i-Phach or "breathed" (Gen. 2:7); much the same as Rua^h or "breath," "spirit."



350 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
connecting thus with the Accadian Ne-Urugal or "lord of the Abode of the Dead/' we are led
to see why the hottest month of summer is yet
called Shawal by the Arabs, as it was ''the
Tamuz" of the Jews and other Shemites, and the Mezore of the Egyptians, which led the Jews to call that country Mizera-im in place
of its name ""Hem or '1ieat," just as they used the Egyptian word Raa or the Sun-god as their word ''evil/' though as sometime Sun-wor
shippers they also called a "friend" Raa-ah
(fem.). In the Koran we find Sha-Aul called
Tal-ut, which is evidently the Horo-Tal (King Thai or Horus-Thal) that Herodotus says the Arabs worshipped; and in later Arab story he appears as Thai-Abba the destroyer, who appears in the Hosea (13:5) as Thal-Aob-ah or "great-drouth," and Thai or Thaul is a mere Chaldaic form of the Hebrew word Sha-Aul. Indeed, in this Chaldaic form we may have the Greek Tel-Amon of Salam-is, father of Ajax and of that Teuker of Cyprus
to whom a man was yearly sacrificed at least
up to the 2d century after Christ, w^hich name Teuk-er reminds us of the body of Sha-Aul
"fastened" or Takea to the walls of Beth-Shan.
At Rome the usual name of the Sun was Sol,
which is Sha-Aul perhaps, through Phoenician



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 351
traffic, just as they got their word De-us from
the Egyptian word Dau, ''to give," so that
Deus means the "Giver." 46. Howbeit, Sha-Aul was the first Meshia'^h and Malach, as ^Har or ''Horus"
was in Egypt after the rule of the Gods. Je-^ hoah told Shemu-El (i Sam. 9:16) a man is sent to him whom he shall anoint Negid over
Israel, that ''he may Ho-Shiaa my people,
whose cry has come" to Jehoah, just as he told Mosheh (Ex. 3:9) ; but Jehoah utterly contradicts himself in this, for he also told Shemu-El
(8:7) that in their request for a Malech they
were rejecting him, Jehoah; and yet this whole
account of the choice of Sha-Aul is duplicate
and contradictory, attesting the protest of the
priests against royalty in the later time.
Negid or "captain" is clearly the Egyptian
word Ne^het or "strong," a title of Horus, and appearing as Necho and as the Greek word Nike or "victor"; but Mesha'^h-et or "anoint"
means also "destroy," so that Jehoah talks
oracularly, and the Roah or "seer" does both
by and by. Sha-Aul was a Tob or "goodly," like Mosheh, and he was also a Gibbor ''Hail
or "mighty-man of valor," besides which he
was the ''Hemed-ath or "desired" of all Israel,
which word as Ma'^hemad or "pleasant" ( i K.



352 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
20:6) seems to sustain the argument that Mo""Hamed was an assumed name of the founder of Islam, and that this remark as to Sha-Aul
the Meshia^'h was the cause of it, though the word is not infrequent in both Hebrew and Arabic, and is probably from the Egyptian ^'Hem-at or "wife," "woman/' One account says Shemu-El anointed him, then sent him on
a curious course of initiation or transfigura
tion, for at the tomb of Ra'^hel he found two
men in Zele Za^'h, that is, "in the shadow,
dazzling-white" (Luke 24:4; Mat 17:2-3), and these told him the Athon-im or "asses'* he
sought were found, while his father had left
the things of the asses and fear for them, saying, "What Aesah my son?" a word meaning to "do," "make," and the Gospel recognition probably refers also to Shemu-El, who kissed
him, and said "this not because thou the
anointed of Jehoah to oversee his possession,"
but because of the attractions of the youth. He then went to Tabor, a mountain, where he met three men, which was the number Jesus had with him (Mat. 17:1), "and they ask of
thee peace," and give him bread; after which
he came to Gibe-Aath of the God, met prophets
coming down from the high-place with music,
who prophesied, whereupon Rua^'h Jehoah



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 353
overshadowed him, he also prophesied, and was
turned into another man, that is, was transfig
ured, ''for the God with thee." But Sha-Aul
did not tell his imcle what Shemu-El said of
the kingdom, and Jesus required silence as to
his vision (17:9). Whether the devil cast out
by Jesus on this occasion (17:18) is the Athon
or ''ass'' of the Sha-Aul initiation must de
pend on the folk-lore of the poor Galileans of
that time, and it was an emblem of Set or Nub-ti in Egypt. The word Za'^h or "daz
zling-white" is a word for the Sun in Arabic,
as the Matthew seems to know, but the "glory''
attaches also to the two men in the Luke (9 :3i ).
Burial-place of Ra^'hel was near Beth Le^'h-em,
far south of Tabor, and, as Ra^'hel means a
"sheep" or "estray" it is not certain that this
allusion is to the ancestry of the Beni-Amin-i or "Sons-of-Amen," of whom Sha-Aul was one, and Amen was the ram-head concept of
Deity. Howbeit, this initiation of the first
Meshia^'h seems an outline of the sacred mys
teries. But the sons of Beli-Jael mocked when Sha-Aul had been chosen, and they Ji-Bez-uh
him, but he "was like a Ma-'^Herish" or "work
er," "carpenter," "smith."
47. His first exploit was to relieve Ja
Besh Gile-Aad by defeating Na^hash or "ser

354 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
pent" of Aammon-i, which he did by assembhng 330,000 men in Bez-ek, which means "rays-of-Hght" (Ezek. 1:14), but ''sun-rise" in Arabic, while Na^'has in Egyptian means
''dark"; and he told the messengers of Jabesh they should be saved "tomorrow in the heat of the Sun," and hence the fight began at the morning watch and ended at the heat of the
day; then all Israel went to the Gilgal, which was probably a name of the Sun-disk, which at Sippara on the Euphrates was the special symbol of God and called Malek, as Sha-Aul
was the first Malech ; but, in any case, we have
here a solar victory by the visible disk or fire
god, though it is curious that Molech should be the especial name of God in Aammon. Horns and Apollo, Perseus and Heracles, also triumph over the dragon or serpent. The two
chapters (12 and 13) which follow is the pro
test of the priests again, but the opening verses
of 13 maintain the original story, beginning with "and Sha-Aul was the son of a year in his Malach," that is, was a year old when he became king; a sentence which tends to show
he was the Sun of Summer; sustained as this
is by his reign of two years, and by the use
of Mi-Chemash as his place of retreat, for this
place perhaps received its name Chemosh from



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 355
Sha-Aul, as it is probably a term for Shem-Esh or the Sun; perhaps the winter Sun as the rare word Chem or "longeth" (Ps. 63:1) or
"pale'' would indicate, and as Chim-ham is Da
*vid's friend in his obscuration, so that Mi
Chem-Ash is used to describe Sha-Aul's condition. The 330,000 warriors with whom he overcame Na^'h-Ash at la-Besh or ''drouth"
have disappeared, there are not even any
weapons, Israel was in caves and thickets, "and
the Ai-Ber-im they Aa-Ber the Joredan" (13:
7),* a fact that seems to have been fatal.
48. But, when the Philistines occupied Mi-Chem-ash, Jonathan said to his armorbearer "Go and na-Ae-Ber-ah to the garrison of the Philistines which from Ae-Ber yonder." "Between the Ma-Ae-Ber-oth which soug;ht Jonathan to Ae-Bor" to the garrison "a Shen of the rock from the Ae-Ber on this and a Shen of the rock from the Ae-Ber from that," which
may be as simple a statement as rendered, but
the words ^'Harad Elohim or "very-great trem
bling" ; and other "trembling" or ""Harad after
Jonathan gets into the "garrison," suggests that
he is the Egyptian ''Har-pa-'^Herad or "child
* "Some" of them is a patent mis-rendering, perhaps caused by (14:21) those "round-about." This sanctified sect seem to have obtained dominance in course of time and were
perhaps those who had "passed-through" the Mysteries.



356 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
god/' and I understand the Shen to be his sym
bol the "lotus/' since Sheen is the Egyptian
name of it, and this is sustained by their names Bo-Zez or "in flower" and Seneh or "bush";
in which case the incident seems that of a res-*
urrection or re-birth; hence this "garrison" or
Ma-Zab, also "memorial-pillar" (Gen. 28:18,
22), said that the Ai-Ber-im came forth from the *^Hor-im which had hidden them there, and
''Hor is "cave" or "white-linen," in Egyptian it is "God/' 49. Then Sha-Aul resumed his sway, and is given somewhat of a human history. He is placed in antagonism to young David, a
more southerly type. Sha-Aul fell in the
Mount Gil-Boaa, and the Philistines put his armor in Beth Aash-Tor-eth, his body they
fastened to the walls of Beth-Shan, which
word "body" or Gevi-oth sounds like Jove,
whereupon the parallel passage in Chronicles
(10:12) is Gupath which resembles Jupiter. His burial at la-Besh-ah, under the Esh-El,
identifies him with the "fire-god" Besh or Bes but David buried him at Zel-Aa, meaning "halting," "lame," so that Pata'h or Vulcan
is suggested, and so his lame son MephiBesheth seems "Memphis shame"; nor must
one overlook his last words, "for Sha-Bez has



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 357
seized me," perhaps Esh-Bez, as in case of
Herakles whose funeral pyre is the sun-set,
and yet the Sha is the beast type of Nubati or
Set in Egypt, and the first syllable in the word
Sha-Aul, seems to identify him with that con
cept, as is assured by the word Shu-Aal or
''jackal,'' "fox," as also by the word She-Ol or
Hades, and that the sacred isle Shayle at the
first cataract was also called Set. And so it
is that the Sha-Bez who seized Sha-Aul (2 Sam. 1 19) seems certainly a monster, and the
word is not used elsewhere save in the 28th
of the Exodus,* as if figured on the priests'
robes, perhaps the "ensnarer," and something like the Se-Aar-ah or "whirlwind" of EH-Jahu and ^-Sav, though less benignant. 50. At times an evil Rua^'h troubled Sha
Aul, and latterly he is found sleeping, and in
caves, and in the Ma-Ae-Gal-ah or "place-ofwagons" (!), suggesting 'Ha-t-'^Har or the "heifer-goddess." His wife A^hi-Noa-Am,
like Ae-Gal-ah, was also wife of David, and
perhaps the same as Naa-Ami or Mara of
Beth-Le'^hem, widow of Eli-Melech, and Naa
Am means "wandering-mother," and A'^h ex
presses the wail of grief; and in Phoenician
*Ex. 28:3, 11, 13, 14, 20, 39, "embroidered," "plaited," "ouches," etc.



358 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the wife of El-Melech was called Ashetharthe
Noema, the Greek Astarte, the Hebrew Eseter or "Esther," the Babylonian Ishetar, phases of the great-Mother. In the song of Kash
ath or "archer/' Sha-Aul and Jonathan are
called "the Zeb-i of Israel," possibly "the
glory," but Zeb means several things besides the stem of the word Zaba-oth or "hosts," and
it is possibly a reverse of Bez-i or Ja-Bus. That he was the ^-Sav or I-Sham-Ae-El of
north Arabia, and the Je-Petha^h of the trans
Jordan, and Melech-Aareth or "skin-king" of Tyre, seems to me probable; all of whom were apparently phases of the fierce Sun of
summer, for he is the most majestic save
^-Sav of all these ideals; "clothing the daughters of Israel with scarlet sumptuously,"
"nor could he live after that he was fallen." His supplanter was David, who seems to ex
press much the same as Ja-Aakob, as Eli-Shaa, as I-Za'^hak, as "Horus." Unless as She-Aol,
naught is said of Sha-Aul in the later records,
nor in the prophets, but in an account of the
kings of Edom (Gen. 36:35-39) the names Ha-Dad and Samel-ah and Sha-Aul appear
as successors, and even a second Ha-Dad or
Je-Did, and a Baal-^'Hanan who suggests the
EPHanan that killed Goliath (2 Sam. 2i:ig),



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 359
SO that coincidence is out of the question. It
seems probable that ''the Tammuz" for whom
women wept in the time of Ezekiel (8:14) was Sha-Aul, a phase of whom was perhaps ABesh-Alom, and as ""Hemed-ath of women (Dan. 11:37) he not only appears later, but gave name to one of the great founders of
religions."^
51. Gide-Aon or Jeru-Ba-Aal, a phase of this warrior saviour, seems his name at Shechem, and was perhaps the same as Jere-Boaam who built Shechem. Se^hem or Lato-polis in Egypt was a famous shrine where the shoulder
of Osiris was buried, and in Hebrew ''shoulder'' is Shechem, while Jere-Boaam was from Egypt, and his father Nebat was evidently
the evil deity Nubti or Set; and the Aon in
Gide-Aon means "evil" or "iniquity''; but the
long ears of Nub-ti or Nebat probably suggested the name ""Hamor or "ass" when the
Jehovists told of Jakob's purchase there from
his children. A more favorable story was that
the bones of Joseph had been brought out of Egypt and buried there, and the inhabitants
claimed descent from him, so that he was prob
*cHamel-an, the same as Mo-cHemed, appears (Gen. 36:26) as a descendant of ^-Sav; but the later scribe (1 Chron. 1:41) has it ^Hamer-an or "ass," which must be a recent alteration.



36o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
ably El-Ber-ith or Ba-Aal-Berith who was worshipped there; but as Pere is rendered
"wild-ass" it may be that (E prosthetic)
Phera-im is a term for the Bene-'^Hamor,
though Par or Phar is "bullock," and the bull Apis seems to have been worshipped by the Ephera-im. Gide-Aon, however, means "badgoat," his place Ae-Pher-ah means "roe" or "fawn," and he may connect with ^-Sav of Seair and the goat symbol at Mendes. At the time the angel told him he was a Gibbor "Tlail,
and commissioned him, the people were, as in time of Sha-Aul, hiding in caves, and the land
was ravaged, but each was told "the God" or Jehoah was with him. His defeat and pursuit
of the oppressor is the defeat and pursuit that Jeho-Shuaa and Je-Pheta^h and Sha-Aul achieve; the victory of the Sun over cold and darkness ; and this is shown when he assembles
his forces at ""Harod, "discomfits" or ""Harid
the foe, and pauses at the ascent of ""Heres;
thus leaving us to learn that he is ^Herad or
Horus, the divine son; for Zeeb or "wolf,"
Aoreb or "evening," Zeba^'h* or "sacrifice,"
Zal-Mum-aa or "shadow-held-back," all sup
port this view; besides which we have Penu
* Zebak was the crocodile-god, emblem of darkness, in Egypt.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 361
El or the ''afore-god" and Such-oth suggesting the hidden, and the sex of the two is suggested when he slew the men of the one and
''knew'' the other with briers; but so the Sun
arose as Jakob Aaber Penu-El, supplanted ^-Sav, and built Such-oth; and "arose" is
Zera^'h, reverse of '^Harez ("Horus") ; and in
case of Sha-Aul when the people were in caves
and holes they followed him ''Hared, though it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who attacked the enemy as Gide-Aon and his serv
ant Pur-ah ( ''bough," "heifer," indicating the Spring, as Per is Egyptian for "comingforth"), and Jonathan was ""Herad of Elohim. This word ''Herad or "tremble" may be the Chaldaic Kurad, a term applied to the governing-god Bel in their account of the Deluge,
and rendered "warrior," and so this Bel
Merodach, a personification of the rising Sun,
is also called Abkal or "herald," and as father
of Esther he is called Abi-^'Hail, hence we may
see that the ''H of Hebrew and the Chaldaic
K are only variants; and the ^Herad of the
Egyptians is called ""Har-pa-kerad or "Harpo
krates" by the Greeks ; so that the child ^Herad becomes in time the warrior ""Har or "Horus," just as Gide-Aon and Sha-Aul begin with ''Harod or "trembhng," and the former ends



362 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
his combat at the rising of ''Heres, as Jonath
an's ""Hared ends when he is made le-Shua-ah or "salvation/' which Shua seems the Egyp
tian god of "light." So, Sha-Aul, after his
victory over Na^'hash or the "serpent" ( i Sam.
II :i3), and the account of the child given the
Shun-Em woman for her ""Harad by Eli-Shaa and whom he made ""Ham or "warm" after death (and ''Ham-ah is rendered the "Sun" in
several places) ; for ""Har or "Horus" and Shu
in Egyptian religion seem mere variants
caused by time or locality, and, as one was
son of Ar-'^Hes or "Osiris" and the other was son of Raa or the Sun, the word ^Herad seems
originally to have referred to the childhood of
this third person of the triads, and who in
process of time developed a personality of his own, retaining the appearance and beauty of youth.
52. That Gide-Aon destroyed Penu-El,
which Jere-Boaam built and Jakob passed over, seems to show a connection of them, and his connection with Shechem is made to appear
opposed to that of Jakob, though this priestly
device is contrary to the statement that Joseph's
bones were buried there; but at all events the
Aa-Pher-ah of Gide-Aon accords with the Ae
Gel-i of Jereboaam, since both mean the "calf"



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 363
worship of Apis or of 'Ha-t-'^Har the ''cowgoddess/' the Ma-Aa-Gal or "place-of-wagons ( !)" of Sha-Aul, the Ae-Gal-ah who was wife of David, with the Ae-Gal or "disk," "wheel," between the horns, known perhaps by her
shrine of "the Gil-Gal-ah"; and, as one of
these Ae-Gal was placed at Beth-El by JereBoaam, and that was the place consecrated by
Jakob, it may be seen that Jereboaam and Jakob were phases of the same concept. The
night wrestle of Jakob or Isera-El, who was
from ""Haur-an or "caves," and with Peni-El
or the "afore-God," is merely the battle of Gide-Aon, Sha-Aul, Jonathan, coming out of the cave of the Sun to Aaber or "pass-over"
the sky; told also when Abram the son of
Tera^'h (reverse of ''Herat) comes out of
''Har-an to Shechem and Beth-El, and afterwards wins a victory at Dan. The Egyptian conceit was that the Sun was "shut-up" or
Seker in a boat, and the Teb-ah or Teb-eth
("ark," "basket") of Noa^h and Mosheh, refer to the month Tebeth, the Egyptian Tib-i, in
which the winter solstice occurs, and the words Teb-aa and Tabal in Hebrew are rendered
"immerse," "sink"; the Accadian symbol of the month being a goat, hence Capri-Cornu,
and perhaps Gide or "goat" in the name Gide



364 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Aon. The classic Pan is apparently the same general concept, expressing the Sun in covert, and this Chaldaic and Hebrew word is that
also of the Phoenicians who lent it to the Greeks; but with this we seem obliged to
couple Pa-Aan or "the Ape'' in Egyptian, symbol of the wise Ta^hut or "Thoth/' Seair-im
or "he-goats," as well as calves, were sacred emblems at Shechem (2 Chr. 11:15), and of course elsewhere among the Israehtes (Lev.
17:7), as among the more intelligent Egyp
tians, and his name indicates that Gide-Aon
was a personification of this cult, as ^-Sav
was, while its hold on the people, after the rise
of Jahvism, seems manifest in the gift of one of the goats of the Chepher or "atonement" to
Aaz-Azel or the "goat-departed."
53. The shrine at Beth Le^'hem must have
been ancient. It was so situated as to be subject to both Arabic and Egyptian influences. One name for the place was E-Pherath-ah.
While no clear mention of it as a shrine is to be found, the statement that the divine hero
David was born there, that the divine heroine Ra^'hel was buried there, it seems to have had
a sacred well (2 Sam. 23:14-17), it was the point of assembly for the migration -to Egypt
(Jere. 41:17), and that it was a holy place is



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 365
attested by the fact that David's birthplace was
probably so assigned because of a popular legend that a ruler was to come from the town
(Micah. 5:2), for I take it that the prophetic
books antedate the history.
54. But to bring forth a divine one a mother must be supposed for him, and so Beth Le'^h-Em or E-Pherath-ah must have been the shrine of a goddess. The nearness of Egypt of course made known the wanderings and
sorrows of Isis, her search for Osiris and her hiding in the marshes with her child Horus; hence we have this wandering and sorrowing mother as Ha-Gar "the Stranger," as Ra'^hel "the Estray,'' Naa-Am-i "the Wandering
Mothers,'' as her plural form of name includes Ruth. Naa means "wanderer" both in Egyptian and Hebrew, and Run in Egyptian has the same meaning; Naa-Ami being also called Mara, which in Egyptian means "beloved." This view of the "Wandering Mother" would make of Ja-Aakob, whose name in Egyptian means "weeper," and Aberaham and Eli-Melech the same personage, and the same with
Bo-Aaz. The divine son was therefore called Bine-Iamin and I-Shem-aa-El and Aobed.
Shem in Egyptian means "to go," and Aa
means "great," so that I-Shem-Aa in that



366 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
tongue means the ''great nomad" ; and we are distinctly told (Gen. 21:20) "and a God was
the lad," for the word "with" is not there. I-Shemaa-El was not born at Beth Le^iem, but not far away, and the trend of religious
sentiment in that region is shown in his case,
as more in that of his wandering mother. Of Bine-Iamin, perhaps "Son-of-my-Nurse," and
Aobed or "servant" little is to be said save
that their names recall that of the god Amen
and that of the shrine Abyd-os of Osiris, and
the latter is said by Budge to be Ab-Du or
"Heart's Desire," but it seems that this Aobed must be the same as David, a name of Osiris. Naa-Ami was also said to be daughter of "Lamech," which I take to be Malech by the
transposition of a letter ; and she was sister of
Noa^'h, who was probably the same as Bo-Aaz, for when Naa-Ami sends Ruth to Bo-Aaz the words are "Shall I not seek Ma-Noa'^h for thee?" (Ruth 3:1) ; and then the drunkenness of the two; but Bo-Aaz had C^anep or "wing," not "skirt," yet Noa'h "walked a God," not "with" God (Gen. 6:9), and as the vine
planter has been identified with Osiris and
Bacchus. Besides, the Aa-Morrha or "sheaf"
(Ruth 2:15) that Bo-Aaz was harvesting, is the Aa-Morrha, not "Go-Morrha," where the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 367
drunken Lot dwelt, and he was evidently the same as Bo-Aaz, that is, Melach-Aareth or ElMalech. As for Ra^'hel, she seems to have had
a sepulchre at Zele-Za^'h or ''bright-shade,"
where two men delivered her oracles (i Sam. 10:2), but this must have been Beth-Le4iem
or near it (Gen. 35:19). 55. The words Beth Le'^h-Em seem to me to mean ''House of the Shining-Mother," as from the Arab word Lua^'h or "shining," and
so Lu'^h-oth the "bright tablets" on which the Commandments are said to have been written; also the La'^hai Roi or "Shining Vision" of
Hagar and the Le'^h-i or "rays" (not "jawbone") of Shimeshon. E-Phe-Ra-th-ah seems to me Aphrodite as the Egyptian form Phe
Raa-Tat or "Gift-of-the-Sun" is apparent, and
we must not consider Aphrodite in the light and wanton way that is often done by the
classic writers, but as the Great Mother, whose cultus under that name was brought from Ask
elon to Greece, Herodotus (i 1105) says. There
are similar stories of Ceres, Alek-Mena, La
tona, Isis, Ino, Niobe, &c., and the object of
the book Ruth is that of a Jahvist writer to
show that the shrine at Beth-Le'^hem was only
that of one or two ordinary women, not god
desses, though he could not free himself from



368 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the main features of the general legend. He
even accepts the Egyptian concept of Latona as nurse instead of mother of Apollo or Horus that Herodotus points out when writing of the
famous oracle at "Buto'' or Pe'-Uat, where
the nurse is 'Xady of Bes'' according to the
Ritual, and also appears as a serpent guarding
the lion Le'^hu or Re4iu, doubltess Horus.
56. The several aspects of the Great
Mother were such that they not only grieved
for husband or children they had lost but
because they were sterile. Ruth and Tamar
and Ra^'hel, who are practically the same (Ruth
4:11-12), employed artifice that they might
bear, and so the daughters of Lot. And Ruth
bearing Joseph, said "God increase my ""Herep
eth'' that she might have another son, but her
next son was not by Reuben, for Ja-Aakob
calls him Bi-Nei-Amin or "in faithfulness";'''
yet the Isaiah (47:3) says this ''Herep could
be uncovered so as to be seen ; Geliath says "I
^'Herep-ath-ah the array of Israel (i Sam. 17:
10), which seems to be a lewd allusion; and,
at the circumcizing performance of Jeho
Shuaa (Josh. 5:9), Jehoah says he this day
rolled-away the ^'Herep of Egypt from upon
* Naa-Aman was the name of a son of Bineimin.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 369
them, for the writer thinks circumcision would
distinguish Israehtes from Egyptians, among
whom the rite was perhaps confined to the
priesthood at that time. Another name of this barren mother was ""Han-ah of the Ramath-ah,
wife of El-Kan-ah, but she went to the temple,
told that she wanted the seed of men, and soon
after bore Shemu-El (i Sam. 2:22), for she
was in Mar-ath or ''bitterness" of soul, as
Naa-Ami was Mara, while El-Kan-ah is the
''purchase-god," as Bo-Aaz Kan-ah Ruth (4: 10) ; but ^'Han-ah is the "mercy," appear
ing in the name ""Hanibal of Carthage, while
in Egyptian it means "princess," "prophetess."
It is interesting to know that there was a Chal
or "temple" at Shiloh to Jehoah (i Sam. i :io)
something like a century before there was one
at Jerushalem to him, but these buildings were
usually called Beith or "house," the Egyptian word Bet and Chaldean word Bit. 57. The demi-god repute left to Sha-Aul
must call attention to the name of his wife,
A^'hi-Noaam,* and she or some other of the
same name is a wife of David, but the former
* iVhi is usually "brother," but is also expressive of wailing, as "Ah!" "Alas!" (Ezek. 6:11, etc.), Achi-Noaam, wife of Sha-Aul, lost all her sons in battle, and David's A^hi
Noaam was mother of Amenon who was murdered by Abeshalom.
24



370 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
is daughter of A^'hima-Aaz and the latter was
from Je-Zere-El; but it is not easy to say that
either connects with Naa-Ami or her shrine; whereas Naa-Am-ah the mother of Re'^hoboaam was an Aamon-ite, next to Moab, and Shelomeh could scarcely be supposed to have
less than a divine nymph for wife. And the
several recurrences of the name seem to in
dicate the Phoenicia goddess Noema or AstroNoema or Aashtar-Noema, said by Proclus to have been deemed ''Mother of the Gods'' in
Phoenicia. And a point of contact may be found when Sha-Aul speaks of A^'hi-Noaam (i Sam. 20:30) as Na-Aveth the Mared-uth,
rendered "perverse-rebellious," but Naa-Aveth
may be "wandering-desirer" or "for lust,"
equivalent to street-walker, and Marud-uth
is likewise "wanderer" (Isaiah 58:7), thus
assimilating her to Naa-Ami and the lascivious
Ruth, Tamar, &c. 58. The famous passage in Micah (5:2) indicates that Epherath-ah or Beth-Le^'hem had become famous in past time for supplying a Moshel or "ruler," perhaps David, and another might be expected from it, "whose go
ings-forth Ma-Kedem, from days forever" (Ma-Kedem meaning usually "from the east
ward") ; that is, like the goings-forth of the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 371
former one, and continue always; "and this
shall be Shelom'' (v. 5), which ''peace" or
completion may refer to Shelom-eh; hence I
Selam and Mo-Selem (''Islam/' ''Moslem") of Mo-'^Hamed seem taken from this obscure prophecy ; and the Matthew and Luke location
of the birth of Jesus at this shrine of Mara or
Naa-Ami, when his mother traveled thither, must be wholly ascribed to it, though the Greek
name Jesus is that of Jishai the father of
David, unless from Jeze or "come-forth," or from a form of Shuaa or "savior." Emperor
Hadian caused a grove to be planted at BethLe^'hem for Adonis a century after the Cruci
fixion, and a statue of Aphrodite at the hill Golgotha.
59. Jona-Than was son of A'^hi-Noa-Am, with whom David intrigued (i Sam. 20:30). He is attached to the concept of the majestic Sha-Aul as a subordinate of more human and mediatorial function; not as the Euphratic
peoples depicted a Shak-Ul or Sha-Gil at the
side of their deities, of smaller figure, and sug
gesting the Egyptian Saa^'h or spiritual body,
but rather as the third person of a triad, like
''Har-pa-^'Herad or the "child-god" of Egypt,
also called A'^hi, ^Hons, &c., though his name
suggests a cup-bearer like Ganymede. Jon



372 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
athan is the most perfect of all the Hebrew
characters. He figures as affectionate to both
his father and David. In the 14th of 2 Samuel we have a chapter on which the New Testament writers seem to have drawn for an account of the Resurrection and even of the Epiphany. In the preceding account I have given of Sha-Aul this remarkable theophany or Aa-Ber is mentioned, for the frequent use
of Aaber indicates a ''procession" or ''going
forth" of somewhat divine, such as the Aaber of Merodach when at Babylon the statue of
that deity was borne in ''procession," and so
the Un ''Her Heb or "show face festival" in
Egypt on like occasions, as the reverse word
Abe-Rech (''Her-Eba) or "a face feast" was
cried before Joseph in the Ma-Shen-ah chariot, and so Mount ^'Hor-eb where Mosheh and EliJahu saw Jehoah Aa-Ber or "pass-by." The Shen or Ma-Shen-ah, "rocky-crag" and "sec
ond" chariot, seems the lotus," or Shen as
called in Egypt, symbol of re-birth and of
''Har-pa-^Herad or "Horus the Child," hence
from ^Herad possibly the word Chr-ist,* as from "Hor-us" we have the avenging Ores-tes,
* I am quite confident the Greek word Christ is from the
Eg>'ptian word ^^Heru or "word," "voice," as in Maa ^Heru or the "true-word" which every pious Egyptian claimed to possess.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 373
the war-god Ares, &c. The word ''Her-ad or
''trembhng/' and even to "^Hered-ath Elohim,"
not 'Very-great trembHng," indicate the iden
tity of Jonathan with '^Har-pa-^'Herad. The
Aiber-im or ''Hebrews" had come out of their *^Hor-im, ''holes," or "white^Hnen," had Gal-ah
or "discovered" themselves, the Aeber or "passover" was effected, the "garrison" or "mem
orial-pillar" was entered, the guards "did tremble and became as dead men" (Mat. 28: 4), there was an earth-"quake,"* and then the watchmen saw the multitude melt-away and scatter. But the Hamon or "multitude" is
usually "faithful," perhaps the risen "saints"
of the Matthews, but also "pillar"; Na-Mug or "melt-away" might suggest Magi to a Greek writer, as ha-Lom or "silence" seems like "Helom or "dream" (Mat. 2:12), while "^Herad or "tremble" is doutbless the word Herod, and Gal or "discover" also means
"roU"-away. If we take lon-Athan, in this
original story, as the Egyptian Aoun-Aten or
"visible-disk" of the Sun, "who saileth over
the celestial regions," "who though an old man shineth in the form of one that is young."t
^Ragaz is usually a quake or agitation, but A-Regaz is
"coffer" (I Sam. 6:8), perhaps as having on it some figure of terror, and yet suggestive in this instance. t From "Book of the dead of Nesi-Khons, priestess of
Amen-Roa," who is "the holy Form, beloved," etc.



374 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
We might understand it better, and still better
when Plutarch (''Isis and Osiris/' ii) testifies,
''They do indeed characterise the rising Sun
as if it sprang every day out of the Lotus"
since the Shen or ''rocky-crag" is the Egyptian
word for the Lotus, Ba-Zez is "in-flower,"
Sen-ah is the "bush" in which at ""Horeb-ah the angel appeared in fire to Mosheh; Aa-Ber
seems the Egyptian Bar-is or "boat," and the Sun was always supposed to voyage over in a boat, and the Aiber-im or "Hebrews" were thus Sun-worshippers. Ma-Zab or "garrison"
probably is the "host" or Zaba-oth of stars as Zeb is "star" in Egyptian; while Na-Mug is possibly the Egyptian word Num-An^h or
"sun-set," as they often elided the "n," though Num-An^h means "second-life," hence Hebrew "slumber" or Num; and the reference to Hamon as departing seems to be the Egyptian Amen-t or "west," or Amen-ti the abode of
the dead.
60. Even the word Pelishet or "Philistine"
seems to me the Egyptian Pe-Lesetau or PeRestau or "the Gate-of-the-Passage," that is,
to the After-Life, so often mentioned in the
Ritual, and a fearsome place; hence a god of
the people feared to Na'^h them that way (Ex.
13:17); and the name of Egypt's northeast



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 375
fortress, the classic Pe-Lushi-um, must illus
trate this suggestion of the origin of the name
of this people and of the passage-pylon or Pe
Lesetau ; and it is clear that the Lishech-ath of Nathan-Melech or the ''giver-king," by which
stood the horses of the Sun, which Nathan-u
Malech-i or "kings gave them," &c., was a pro-pylon (2 K. 23:11). The constant prayer
of the Book of Dead is that they may "go in
and come out, and find food," wherefore their word Per-t or "coming-forth" (from the Underworld) may give us the word Ae-Ber or Aa-Per-t; and hence it must be seen that the
Pelesh-et-im or ''Philistines" were so named
from their dwelling at the pass-way out of
Egypt, but the place itself is equivalent to the
Christian Purgatory or place of expiation;
hence they are called C^epetor-im, probably
C^epereth-im or "expationers," since it is said
(Gen. 10:14) "for the Selu^'h-im or "pardoned" who went out from Egypt (or the Pathros-im)
are the Peleshet-im and C'apetor-im.
61. The subsequent battle and pursuit
seem a later elaboration, though by putting his hand to his mouth (i Sam. 14:26-27) we have a confirmation of Jonathan as ""Har-pa-^Herad
as, also, in the third installment of the story
(vs. 36-46), his "hair" or side-lock as child



376 - EGYPT AND ISRAEL
god was preserved (v. 45), and he is called
"the Jonathan," no night attack could be made
as Jonathan was new risen, and he is accredited
with the Je-Shu-Aa-ah or "the Salvation'' ; Shu
in Egyptian meaning "light." As Jeshuaa it
may be seen that this is another version of the
victory and pursuit of the Amorites by Josh
uaa, and so of Gide-Aon, Je-Petha''h, &c., being
the pursuit of Set by Horus Be^'hud. The flow
of "honey-wine" or Dabesh in the forest is
important, for honey was a favorite offering
of the Egyptians to Deity; and the taste of it
"enlightened" (ti-Raen-ah, v. 27; Aor, v. 29)
his eyes; perhaps "brightened."
62. It is interesting to note that v. 21 says
that the Aibera-im had been with the Phil
istines; as it is also said (13:7) this people
Aaber the Jordan when the Israelites hid in
caves, and the word "some" is not there
(comp. V. 3) ; and so, when Pharaoh does not
know the God of Bene-Israel, Mosheh tells
him he has met the God of the Aibera-im, and of him Pharaoh does not deny knowledge (Ex.
5:1-4); so that it is probable they were a
separate tribe or a different religious sect from
the Israelites. Yet the Philistines recognize
Jonathan and his armor-bearer as Abera-im



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 377
(i Sam. 14:11), though that is in the first instalment (vs. I -1 6) of this theophany.
63. That there is more than one instalment of this famous chapter appears from vv.
2^ and 45, where the Shuaa or ''salvation" is
ascribed in one verse to Jehoah and in the
other verse to ''the Jonathan." Shu-Aa in
Egyptian means "great-light," and is person
ified in the god Shu-sa-Raa or "Shu-the-son
of-Sun," an aspect of ""Heru or "Horus." The fact that Jonathan comes out of a ^Hur or
"hole," "cave," is in touch with the Mithraic
and other religious concepts of the Sun, which
in Winter was symbolically supposed to dwell
in a cave, or lie buried in a cave, as if an ascetic
or invalid or even dead. On this occasion he
is resurrected, and at once seizes the Ma-Zeb,
which is usually a "pillar" for the dead, not a
"garrison"; and in Egypt this "pillar" was
called a Dekhen or Men, and was the hieroglyph for Amen-Raa. But one may readily
see that this resurrection or rise of the solar
Jonathan supplied the Matthew author with
much of his startling phenomena of a later
time.



SECTION X
1. It would not be possible for religious
ideas to exist among mankind if they were
exempt from physical evils. They find no re
lief from their fellow-men for many of these;
besides which there are terrifying natural
phenomena, which ignorance only renders more full of awe; hence the imagination of men
leads them to suppose that there are super
human beings, and they supplicate these for
help; hence the religious instinct. It is not a
command from above, but a cry from below,
from the depths of misery and suffering. 2. Shrewd men, sometimes sincere, or
ganize this instinct, these sentiments, by pretending to knowledge of the super-human beings which the diseased imagination of men
create. These shrewd persons also teach that
the calamities or evils which befall mankind
are invoked by their own vicious conduct;
especially conduct not in accord with the teach
ings they give them. Not only are such events
as wars, conflagrations, shipwrecks, plagues,
which are social occurrences, but Earth-quakes,



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 379
storms, lightning, floods, and other natural
phenomena, are freely ascribed by these shrewd
folk to the impiety of men, or what in English
they call "Sin,'' rendered from the Hebrew
and Chaldean ''Hata or ^'Hete, which differs
in the kind of T from the people called ""Hit-im
or "Hittites." This word is wholly ecclesi
astical or religious, and has no foundation in
the natural or social disposition of men, who,
though they bring disease occasionally upon
themselves, are not inclined at all to offend the super-human powers they rely upon when human help is vain. Shrewdness, however, in
variably wins over ignorance, so that the ignorant, who are the mass of mankind, are
brought to the belief that the super-human
beings are too good to inflict calamities unless
provoked to this by human mis-conduct or dis
obedience of the teachings of these wiser
people.
3. It is thus that religious systems and
practices and creeds originate and are main
tained. Deity is merciful, bountiful, just, even
affectionate, and it is his creatures only that
sin or are vile. No blame or responsibility, the
shrewd ones insist, can attach to Deity for the
imperfections of his creatures ; but they declare
it to be right for him to inflict the most severe



38o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
penalties on these creatures for these hnper
fections, otherwise sins. And in almost every
country, or at least among every sect, the fail
ure to supplicate Deity under some particular name such country or sect has bestowed upon him is the most consummate of sins; and no
people could have been more frightfully intol
erant as to this, for their shrewd men make
their Jehoah utter the most ferocious command
respecting it (Deut. 13:6-17); a command
which must have been written after Jehoah's
priesthood felt their sway undisputed, and long after Besheth and Ba-Aal had been the names of Deity in the days of Jeremiah (11:
13), B. C. 600, who seems to have been father
of the fanatic Josiah's wife (2 K. 23:20, 31;
comp. Tere. 1:1-3).
4. It would seem from the statements of the Hebrew writing that no king of the northern monarchy worshipped Jehoah, nor perhaps any king of Jehudah (Jere. 8:1-2) till the time
of Jeremiah, that is, Je-Rem-Jahu or ''Setter
up of Jehoah," and his son-in-law ''Josiah," that
is, Joshi-Jahu or "Supporter-of-Jah," at which
time the name Jahu or Jehoah first began to be applied to Deity, and which name was adopted
by Aa-Zer-aa and his sect. Indeed, it may be
that the word Hue or ''he" was first used, and



The Goddess Kedesh of Egyptian Inscriptions; same perhaps
as Miriam, who died at Kadesh, and perhaps the same as Ruth (Ori-uth).



382 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
when Ne^'hemiah came from Persia he may have broadened the word by using the Persian word Haava or "he," whence Jehoah, Yehaueh, Jehoah, Jehovah, or other form.
5. Jehoah talks face to face with several
of the leading personages, but often employs
''angels" or Maleach-im, and occasionally a
Rua^'h or "spirit," besides many Nebie-im or
''prophets"; and these agents sometimes ex
ecute cruel sentences upon enemies as well as
sinners. Once Satan was allowed to afflict a
good man in the most horrible ways, not for
any sin, but merely to test the man's fidelity
to Jehoah; and the word Satan may be Suten or "King," or Shaat or "pig," both Egyptian
words. The general trend seems to be that
Jehoah combined within himself the dual at
tributes of what in Christian creed is called
God and Devil; thus showing that Persian dualism had no hold upon Hebrew ideas till
toward the time of Jesus. It is Jehoah who drowns all mankind and other animals in Hebrew legend, it is Bel who drowns these in Chaldean epic, and it is Raa the "Sun" who sends Hathor or Se^het to massacre mankind
in Egypt; each of these diabolic horrors tend
ing to show that in neither religion was there
a dividual Devil to commit them or order them,



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 383
but the order came from the chief Deity of the
land ; and, while it is clear that these enormities
are fictions of the shrewd ones, yet the points
under consideration are the provocation and
the agency of destruction, for the provocation
in each case seems to have been neglect of re
ligious duty, that is, sin. So, in the promise
of Jehoah to Bene Iserael respecting the occu
pation of Canaan (Ex. 23:20-33), he says he will send a Maleach (v. 20) before them to guard them and lead them, and that his own
name (Jehoah's) is "in his midst," not "in him" (v. 21); but this Maleach or somewhat
else is called my ^im-ath (v. 27), which seems the Egyptian Aam-Mit or "Eater-ofthe-Dead," depicted in the Judgment Scene
with the head of crocodile, the body of lion, the
hindpart of hippopotamus, and this female beast is to be sent before "and Ha-Moth-i all the people," &c., and Muth in Hebrew and Mit in Egyptian mean "dead" or "death," yet while
there seems a play on this the interpreters un
derstand it "noise," "discomfit" (comp. Ps. 59:7; Is. 59:11), from Ham or Haman, while ^im-ath-ah (Ex. 15:16) seems probably more than an abstract term when we find her name
means an "idol" (Jere. 50:38) ; besides which she may also be the Zeraa-ah or "hornet"



384 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
(Ex. 23:28) in the verse next after calling her
.'^im-ath, but this seems reverse for Aarez, a
word less rarely used, and that it is reverse
may be seen in the Deuteronomy (7:20-21)
which copies the Exodus here, for the word is Zeraa-ah in v. 20 and th-Aaroz or ''af
frighted" in V. 21, rather "terrified," as ^eim
ath ; yet there was such a town as Zoraa-ah for it was a shrine of Shimesh-on; so that, while
the allusion is probably to ^-Zeraa or ''Ezra,"
as the leader from the Exile and chief of the
Jahvist sect, yet Zar-Aa in Egyptian is "great
scorpion," while Zaa-Raa is a "prince" or
"chief-attendant of the Sun" or Raa; neither of which would seem to be the same as ^imath if she was the "Eater" or Aamam of the
Mit or sinful "dead," which I can not doubt.
6. It appears thus that Jehoah pronounced
judgments and used agents of a subordinate kind to execute them ; even being a Tempter to
sin (Ex. 20:20; Deut. 8:2, &c.). His Rua'^h
or "spirit," his Maleach or "angel" (from the Koptic word Mana^h or "worker," or the Egyptian Mena^h or "gracious one") were
the usual emissaries. Dualism was out of
place in such a religious system, but there can be no pride in a monotheism which combines in one the Good Being and the Bad Being. A



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 385
careful and candid study of that which purports to be the words and conduct of the Jewish Deity makes of him a maHgnant and atrocious conception, to whom the adoration of
a humane man seems hardly possible. It must be kept in memory, however, that a barbarous and fanatical period produced the bloody and
merciless picture of sin and its penalties.
7. There is a glimpse of dualism, how
ever, in the Leviticus (16:5, &c. ; comp. 17:7),
w^here a Seair-Aaz or ''he-goat" is made a sin
offering to Aaz-Azel as well as to Jehoah, and
this on the day C^eppor-im or ''Expiations"
of sin (vs. 16-18, 29-34). Aaz means "goat" and "strength"; Azel means "depart," "sent
away." As this strange chapter and this strange custom find no confirmation of their
details elsewhere in the Hebrew scriptures, it
was probably a transient rite, perhaps drawn or cited from a Persian rite which Plutarch
("Isis and Osiris," 46) refers to when he says
that at a certain sacred ceremony "they beat
a plant called Omomi in a mortar, and cry to
Pluto and the Dark ; then mix it with the blood
of a sacrificed wolf and carry it to a place
where the Sun never shines, and cast it away." Aaz-Azel means "goat sent-away" or "strength
departed." In the Jewish ceremony one Aaz



386 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
was loaded with the sins of the people, and
sent away, but the words Aaz-Azel seem ap
plied to some evil being; perhaps the one who
is supposed to take away the beneficence of the
Sun, a very familiar name of whom in Egypt was Khepera,* which sounds like Cheppor;
yet it is curious in this connection that the day
of Cheppor-im, when the two ''goats" figure
so conspicuously, suggests the Latin word Caper or "goat/' Cheppor-eth or "mercy
seat'' was the lid or "covering" of the sacred Aron or "ark" on which stood the Cherubs, and it can not well be doubted that this "ark," the Teb-ah of Noa'^h and Mosheh, was connected with the winter month Teb-eth when the Sun is mainly in its covering of clouds; and from the Ganges to the Nile the Zodiacal
sign for this period was the goat or the goatfish, which sign in Assyrian was called Uz or E-Nezu, which Nez in the kindred Hebrew
would mean "sent-away," also "desolate," and the two words are the same as Aaz-Azel; but Mr. Brugsch says this sign was in Egypt called Pa-Anea4i or "the Life," which I con
sider in connection with the name Zepan-ath
* The figure of a "crab" or Cancer was the Zodiacal sign for the month in which the Sun begins its retreat; but the Egyptians altered it to the Khepera or "scarab," symbol of Khepera and sacred.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 387
Pa-Anea'^h given Joseph ; Zepan-ath in Hebrew meaning ''hidden," also "north" ; and so BaAal Zepon or the Greek form "Typhon." C. Lenorman says the goat was the symbol of ''tempest," which in Hebrew is Seaar-ah (Job
9:17; 38:1, &c.), and the Seair Aaz sent with
their sins by the Jews into the desert may well
be read "storm-goat," or a sacrifice to the evil power which had overcome the Smi, or carried it off in a Sekar or "shut-up" (also ''Hennu)
barge as we see the solar Osiris represented;
and yet this sign must be associated with the
caprine nurse of Zeus, perhaps with the satyr concept Pan, and with /Esav who "returned to
his way of Seair-ah," for Cheper also means "shaggy" in Arabic, hence "lion" or Chephir
(Ps. 35 :i7). This isolated ritual, coupled with
the annual observance of Cheppor-im, tends to
show that the Israelites, like their neighbors,
based their worship or religious observances on the movements of the Sun and hosts of Heaven ; and that Jehoah had some rival who must be propitiated because he had power to overcome the Sun, to bring forth storms, &c.
And it also appears that propitiation was not
all, but that they sacrificed to the Seair-im
(Lev. 17:7; 2 Chr. 11:15). 8. The Jewish observance lom Chippor,



388 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the "day of Expiation" of sins as we interpret
the words, is celebrated the loth day of the
month Tisheri; and Tisheri is deemed by C. Lenormant a word that means in Chaldaic "sanctuary"; hence we might assume the Sun was taking sanctuary or hiding in its holy
place. But too rigid an adherence to a single
physical phenomenon as the basis of ancient
cults or rites is not safe, and if the word
Tisheri is to figure in this observance I sug
gest that in Egyptian the word Tesher means "red," "ruddy"; and that at the time of the
Jewish observance the Nile is at full flood, they "cover" or Chippor the land, and that its wa
ters are red or ruddy with the sands of Abys
sinia. As this, however, is an occasion of rejoicing in Egypt, we might with more
probability reckon w^ith the equally useful Euphrates, the Pur or Pur-ath of the Hebrew and others, which great stream flows through
and was made to irrigate Babylonia; which
begins its rise in March, is at full flood during
June, and has subsided in September, the month Tisheri; for Chepur or Chep-ah means
"bowed-down" (Ps. 145:14; Isa. 58:5), sub
sided, and Chep-Pur, or the sad condition of
the beneficent river, may have originated an
observance to propitiate it or the Deity who



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 389
afflicted it; and the fact of the subsidence of the river, which came and went with the Spring and Summer Sun, could be artfully used upon an ignorant people as an evidence
that they had been guilty of sin, just as in more modern times days of fasting and prayer
are occasionally called for to relieve drouth or
to avert an epidemic. 9. In their famous ten commandments the only sins that are menaced with punishment
is that of having other gods and that of utter
ing the name Jehoah "to S^ave," and the punishment for the former sin was death (Deut. 13:6-18). This command and also its penalty was of course not written till Jehoah had succeeded Ba-Aal and the Queen of Heaven as
the national god (Jere. 11:13; 45:17-19), and after the Ezraite hierarchy had entrenched
themselves behind religious rites and stone walls. Adherence to the name by which the
hierarchy of any sect call the Deity is nearly
all that is required ; non-adherence to his name
is the great sin. But what or who is S^'ave to whom the name Jehoah is not to be carried or
uttered? The word is variously rendered in
EngHsh as 'Vain," "iniquity,'' "destruction," &c. The same word A-Saf-t"^ is rendered
* F in Egyptian and V in Hebrew suppl}' the place of one another.



390 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
''iniquity" in Budge's "Hymn to Osiris" (in
"Gods of the Egyptians"). S''ef-t is also a
name of the great deity ^H-Num, usually de
picted with a ram's head. In more than one
text S^ave seems alluded to as a personality,
to whom incense is burnt (Jere. 18:15). ^^ transcribing the Persian title Kha-Shia-Arsha
we find in the Ezra (4:6), a book written after
the Macedonian conquest, that it is A^'ha
Shave-Rosh, literally ''Brother-of-Vain-Head
or "evil-head"; and so in the Daniel (9:1) and
the Esther (1:1). Gesenius defines "noise"
as the original significance of S^ave and of the
word Haman or Anion, and it is possible that the worship of the ram-head god Amen as
well as ^H-Num or S^ef-t is thus covertly at
tacked, for that was the prevailing type of Zeus in the Macedonian period as it was
in Ta-^Hapi-Ne'^hes ("dark-land-of-the-Nile")
when the Judeans fled thither in the days of
Jerem-Jah. 10. But Chippor was not the only day
when sin offerings were called for, besides
other ofiferings. A numerous priesthood required quantities of food which demanded fre
quent observances in a time when there was
little if any coinage of money. The sacrifice
of their children to Molech was also a sin



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 391
offering; perhaps done only in times of ca
lamity, such as war, drouth, famine, and to
appease the wrath of the god who they were told was thus punishing them for their sins against him; but the burning of Than-oth (or
"lament") the daughter of Ie-Petha''h, that is,
virgins sacrificed to the goddess Tanith, was
to fulfil a vow to avert calamity or insure
victory. The case of the sacrifice of his firstborn son by Me-Ishaa of Moab (2 K. 3 124-27)
was evidently to propitiate his own angry god, Chemosh, who was also worshipped at Jerushalem (i K. 11:7), whereupon the IsraeHtes realized that Chemosh would thus be appeased, and dared not prosecute the war, as dreading
his wrath would fall upon them. A kindred
principle or conception is the Christian idea
of the sacrifice of his only son by God to save the souls of mankind from eternal punishment but in some form or other a mere surface study
of all religions will show that this doctrine
pervades them all. II. It seems to me from the general trend
of the teachings of Jesus that, not only was
sin in the world when he came, but that he
came to save the world from it (John 12:47),
and John the Baptist taught that sin was here
(Luke 2'.^: Mark 1:4); both holding that to



392 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
"repent" would remit sins (Mat. 4:17; Mark 1:15), preparatory to the divine government
"at hand." But in the John (15:22, 24; 16:
8, 9) Jesus startles us by saying that if he had not come "the world" would not have had sin
(15:19), and that sin is merely disbelief as to him (16:9) ; a statement which tends to show
that at the date and place of this Gospel the Church was strong. Jesus nowhere makes use of the Adam and Eve story. In the Matthew
(26:28) he says the wine he offers is his blood,
"shed for many for the remission of sins" ; an
averment not found in other accounts of the Last Supper (Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20; John 13:2). Peter is held to say that repentance
and baptism suffice to remit sins (The Acts 2:
38; 3:19), but elsewhere (10:43) that those
who believe in Jesus "shall receive remission of
sins." In the Luke (24:47) repentance only
is necessary to the remission of sins, but the
John (1:29; 3:16-17) avers that beHef in Jesus remits sins.
12. Whatever the doctrine of Jesus as to
the remedy for sins, the bold Paul was the
first perhaps who claimed that Jesus was the
propitiation or sacrifice that supplied the
remedy (Rom. 3:24-25; 4:25; 5:6, 8, 21; i Cor. 15:3, 22); a doctrine apparently in con



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 393
flict with that second coming taught by Jesus in the 24th of the Matthew and the 15th of
the Mark. According to Paul, Me-Sia'^h had
come, and not to save the Jewish nation, or
even its faith, but to expiate the supposed sin
of the human race. What sin ? Not that which each person may have committed, and which Jesus and John had urged repentance of, but an apparently trivial act done by the alleged
ancestor of mankind several thousand years
before! It was reserved for this ingenious
Paul to revive a story never once referred to even in the Old Testament literature save where it is told, and to assign the wretchedness
of mankind here and hereafter to this story,
as well as to supply a motive for the mission
of Jesus and for his execution. Paul's use of
the words "kick against the pricks," put by
Euripides (Bacchse) into the mouth of DionIsus, after he broke his bonds, shows Paul was not ignorant of Greek mythism, and from
the utter absence from his writings of all al
lusion to the birth and career of Jesus it might
be suspected that Paul was dealing with the
ancient and universal cult we have been dis
cussing. Howbeit, his conceit as applied to an
historic Adam, unnatural as it is, and which
draws to itself no whit of sanction from God's



394 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
talk to Mosheh and the patriarchs, or from any word of Jesus, was adopted by the Church as a basic dogma as soon as that body became
so strong and idle as to leave the staff of the
evangel at the door of temples and cathedrals
of their own. No doctrine which carries with
it a tithe of such consequences has ever before
or since been asserted; certainly none on such
a frail thread of authority; none is less sup
ported by rational thought or a sense of jus
tice ; yet its vitality, rooted in the most striking
of terrestrial and celestial phenomena, is sus
tained and fed by the devout purpose of a cult,
which believes itself monotheistic, to lay the blame of the presence of Evil in the world on
the ancestor of mankind, and to relieve Jehoah
of the onus of diabolism. Paul's first idea was
perhaps to advance a historic reason for the
sacrifice of the divine-man, as the first ques
tion as to his fate must have been why so good a man should have been put to death, since if
it was for his own sin or fault he could not
have been divine, and it would be impious to
allow that Deity sacrificed a child of his loins without a motive of immense portent. Nor
was it easy for a monotheist to say that the Devil had triumphed, though the Luke (22:3)
and the John (13:27) imply as much. Paul„



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 395
however, seems never to have heard of Iskar
iot's agency, for it is Hkely he alludes tO the
Jews generally in i Cor. (11:23), as Stephen does (The Acts 7:52); nor does Paul lay
stress on anyone for the death of Jesus, though probably he was in Jerusalem at the time of
that event. He does not even accuse the ex
isting or any past generation of men of that
sin or sinfulness which made Jesus and the
sacrifice of him essential. But, by a giant
mental stride, he seizes on the common an
cestor, Adam, as the guilty person ; thus deftly absolving God of the onus; and not this only,
but enabling God to do an act of gracious sort
and of mercy by coming forward, after forty
centuries, as a lover of men to that intense
degree that he sent his only child to be killed
in order to rescue the Adam-ah (trans, ''ground") from the curse one man had caused
him to put on it. Paul leaves the after gen
erations no part in this wondrous drama save
to believe or have faith that it is true. It was
perhaps when controverted as to this question of mere saving faith, probably by the James, that the Galatians was elaborated by Paul in
to the fuller averment of his Letter to the
Romans, where the strange doctrine is set forth
in its entiretv.



396 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
13. The ordinary doctrine of sin, and of
its propitiation by sacrifices, or the offerings
of food and gifts to Deity, is in some form everywhere and everywhen common among
men. The priests who have the use of these
offerings are intensely interested in this part
of the ritual. In Paul's time, Jehoah at Jeru
salem, Sar-Apis at Alexandria, Dion-Isos in
Greece, Jupiter and Isis at Rome, as well as
many others, each with sleek priesthood, and
all protected by the civic order, was adored
by the masses. In prosperous or peaceable
times religions become more perfunctory, more
ritualistic, and more indifferent to moral con
duct as a whole. In the hills of Galilee, how
ever, special influences were at work in the
restful days of Augustus, and circumstances
directed these influences against the hereditary
Brahmans at Jerusalem. The epoch was pro
pitious in more aspects than one for bringing
forward a hero, a reformer, a saint; some one
who would make personal sacrifices to vivify a
cold and passive cult, as well as alter wn-etched
social and degrading political conditions. Sev
eral Galileans of the first century attempted
this, as Josephus shows ; but theirs was mainly
an armed effort, or one of violence. Jesus
was also unsuccessful so far as numbers were



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 397
concerned (The Acts 1:15), but left the fame
of a moral as well as religious teacher, of
gentle and gracious methods, and as having
risen bodily from the Kaber. Paul was per
haps his first convert outside of Galilee; cer
tainly the earliest Christian writer, for his
epistles antedate the Gospels ; and the accession
of this able and persistent man perhaps saved
the sect from extinction. His conversion, told
in his own writings (Gal. 1:11-17), hints at
some divine manifestation to him while he was
in Arabia (Ereb, Erebus?);* Elijah's Aoreb
hn (trans, ''ravens") ; a statement which is
thrice found in The Acts, a book compiled some
fifty years later, where the narrative of it has
grown more specific and to dramatic propor
tions; but, whatever its incidents, the fact re
mains that this intellectual man became an
advocate and an evangelist of Jesus, and this
not long after his death; a fact which appeals
to the most skeptical as evidence that Jesus
was no ordinary personage. That none of the
incidents of his life, birth or death, and but
little of his logia, are cited by Paul, whose let
ters are older than the Gospels, is certainly
* Aereb is Hebrew for "west/' and is thus connected with darkness and Hades. Jesus was led by the vSpirit into the Ma-Debar, which I take to mean the same.



398 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
surprising, since it must seem that he had knowledge of these in some sort; and yet he
bases his whole creed on two events, that Jesus
had suffered death in the cause of moral and
religious betterment, and had arisen in his
physical nature from the grave. Paul was of
an ardent and heroic temperament himself, and
the obstinacy with which the Galileans ad
hered to Jesus (Jos. Antiq. i8:i), as in the case of Stephen, must have caused him to
reflect that this sect had a loftier ideal of de
votion than those which current Phariseeism
presented. That ideal of heroism for others,
of self-sacrifice by the young and unpolluted,
filled all literature, then as now. It was called
Buddha on the Yellow Sea, Krishna on the Ganges, Baldur on the Baltic, and for many centuries had borne numerous names all around the Mediterranean. Hebrew as well as classic
story reeked with it. Perhaps Paul's reading
taught him the kinship of religious ideas, and enabled him to break the narrow bonds of
Jewish exclusiveness, as Jesus certainly had
done. Paul does not write that he himself did
any miracles; nor does he seem ever to have known of anyone save Jesus who had been raised from death to life. That statement he
sincerely believed; believing it, he considered



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 399
Jesus the divine man; and a divine man could only come to purify mankind. Consciously or unconsciously Paul connected Jesus with the
universal ideal. He knew that Hebrew liter
ature told that of old, in time of impending
calamity, the first-born had been made a
burnt-offering (2 K. y.2.j\ 21:6; Jere. 7:31;
Ezek. 16:36; Micah 6\y^\ that this seemed
ordained by Nehemiah (10:34-36), that Jehoah had even told Abram to do it, and that
the rite was still practiced in Greece (Pansan
ias 8:38). Paul perhaps shared the belief that
the world was about to be destroyed, and may have expected Jesus to return (i Cor. 11 :26) ; hence some stupendous ''sign" was to be looked
for. But he could only identify the crucified
Jesus with current and ancient cultus; render
ing him the sacrifice; the great step forward
being the association of him with a new Berith
for the benefit of all men; the sons of Noa
(Mat. 24:27) and of Nineveh (16:4), and not an absurd restriction to the sons of Abram ; and
this because it was the common ancestor Adam who had sinned. When Paul wrought out
this broad but curious conceit he raised Chris
tianity from a little Galilean sect, and made
it the heir of Mithra, of Dion-Isos, Osiri, of
Adonis, of Baldur; indeed, of all the pathetic



400 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
cults from the Ganges to the Rhine. He found
in the httle he knew of Jesus a sufficient ideal,
and the facts of his life were of small account.
14. After all, however, Paul's structure
is based on ditheism. He recognizes Satan in
so many words (2 Cor. 11:14). He recognizes him or some other adverse power even
more when God is required to offer his son as
a propitiation, as Agamemnon offers Iphigenia,
when a single word from the author of the universe would have removed sin. This posi
tion was seen to be illogical for monotheism;
hence this painful humiliation of the Creator
is ascribed to love of men, and his wish to
prove it to them; a proposition which still postulates the enormous power which sways the world toward sin.
15. PauFs theory, less the part in it taken
by Adam, was early embraced. In the i John
(1:7; 4:9-10, 14) it is fully dwelt on as an act
of love for men on the part of God. It appears
in the Matthew (26:28), and in the John (i:
29-36; 3:16-17), where Jesus is called the "lamb" (Heb. Sah) of God; and the Apoca
lypse amplifies (5:6, 8, 12-13, &c.). The
putative Pauline books, Ephesians (2:13), Col
ossians (1:14), i Thessalonians (1:10; 5:10), and I Timothy (1:15; 2:6) have it; and so



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 401
Hebrews (2:9, 17) and i Peter (2:24). The
sacrifices of men for others is quite com
mon; the sacrifice of himself for men by a
deity or demi-god was not unusual; and these writings readily adopted it; but none of them
follow Paul in his extraordinary and astute
efifort to fix the guilt on Adam. Sacred writers
could conceive of individual sins, and even of
national ones; and at one time it is said all
men were drowned because of the general de
pravity; but it was left for Paul to attach to
the human race a vicarious suffering because
of Adam, and to grant them a vicarious bless
ing because of Jesus.
16. An ordinary sacrifice or offering to
Deity, especially of one's most valuable thing, was and is thought to reconcile or appease
him; but that only establishes amicable rela
tions of the suppliant with one who can with
hold good or inflict evil. When, however,
Deity is conceived of as good, and good only,
the presence of Evil in the world must seem an
influence or power apart from and hostile to him as well as to men. Paul showed how
the story of Adam's sin was the quarrel or alienation of mankind from God, caused by or
causing the intrusion of the third party of the
triad, and that, to assist men to purge the



402 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
world of this third party, God sent here his
only son to be sacrificed. This implies that
God cannot abate or destroy Evil save with
the help of man, and that it has an existence
independent of him. By the offering of his
son God did not abolish sin, but made an advance toward co-operation with men against the common enemy; which co-operation can
only be had by a "faith" or belief that Jesus
was the divine son, and that he was sent to
die and did die in order to remove or remit the
racial curse or collective sin caused by Adam this being a magnanimous act on the part of
Deity, called his "love" or "grace." 17. But Paul went further, urging that a thorough reconciliation or at-one-ment with
God is had by the cutting off of individual
sins, especially called "lusts of the flesh"; a
subject which the political trend of the teach
ings of Jesus required him to subordinate.
Paul's doctrines therefore demand, not only the
belief in Jesus as the sacrifice for the general
curse, but also a sacrifice of the natural pro
pensities, called the carnal nature, as a response
to the sacrifice by Deity of his carnal nature
or incarnation. By these mutual concessions
or sacrifices Evil can be overcome. A "Godman," or meeting of the divine and human in



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 403
one form, is the appropriate type of this atone-ment; and a "good-man" is the best earthly
representative of the double condition. As a
guide to this kind of life Paul specifies many
moral and social obligations. The curious his
toric dogma and the expiation of it are thus
knit with a moral code; so that by belief in a mystery we are supposed to be assisted along
a path of good to ourselves and to others, since
the mystery points to a life of self-sacrifice;
while the story of Adam's disobedience, b}^
throwing the blame of the introduction of sin
upon mankind, should cause them to strive the
more earnestly not to sin by violating priestly
instruction.
18. And this explanation or dogma has the far-reaching tendency of welding together
the Jewish and Christian historic chains, since a teaching from the former of a doctrine so
wonderful implies other such ; and hence Chris
tianity is freighted with much that both ex
perience and science irreconcilably antagonize
nay, with atrocities which the most devout zeal
must find repulsive, ordered or sanctioned by
an ideal of Deity wholly at variance with the
generous lessons we learn from Jesus. Cer
tainly, it must be said that it is the prophetic
books which are the greater bond of the two



404 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
religions and the two literatures, and that is
the whole theory of the Gospels; and yet we
might, but for Paul's dogma of Adam's sin,
have only had these prophetic books as sacred,
and the historic parts as mere annals, without
religious significance, since there seems a large
balance of reasoning against their having any.



PART II.
[''It ought not to be made a condition of
Salvation to believe that there was once a Man
who by his holiness and merit gave satisfaction
for himself and all others; for of this the Reason tells us nought; but it is the duty of men
universally to elevate themselves to the Ideal
of moral perfection deposited in the Reason, and to obtain moral strength by the contempla
tion of this Ideal. Such moral faith alone is
man bound to exercise, and not historic faith."

CHAPTER I
THE CURIOUS NARRATIVE OF THE CRUCIFIXION
1. The execution of Jesus Christ had not only the earnest approbation of the Jewish
authorities, but of the population at Jerusalem. And it was not approval only, for the rancor
displayed toward him by the authorities and
the populace was extreme. In demanding his
death, in preference to that of Bar-Abbas, it
is clear that Jesus had exasperated the Jews more than if he had committed murder or
robbery, or raised sedition, as Bar- Abbas was
accused of one or the other of these crimes
(comp. Jere. 26:7-11; 38:4), 2. True, one must allow most liberally,
in considering the incidents of his life and
death, for the desire on the part of his bio
graphers to conform these incidents to texts of
the Hebrew scriptures; and hence each reader must judge for himself whether he is being
treated to facts or to this process of confor
mity or fulfilment.
3. As we read, his trial and execution



4o8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
were attended by circumstances of rigor and animosity. That he was scourged (Isaiah 53:
5, ''stripes'' or Chabur-eh, perhaps ''glorified")
was certainly a part incident to the sentence,
or preliminary to the act of crucifixion; but
he was taunted and mocked and insulted (Ps.
22:7-8; Jere. 48:27), and even "pierced" (Ps. 22:16; Zech. 12:10) with nails and a spear. 4. Pilate, the Roman governor, who ex
amined Jesus privately (Jere. 38:14), could not understand that Jesus was guilty of any
oflense, or any serious offense, and certainly
not one which deserved death; but he allowed the clamor of the Judeans to overcome his
adjudgment (Jere. 38:5). The Luke supplies the further information that Herod Antipas,
tetrarch of Perea and Galilee, also examined Jesus, without condemning, but mocked and
derided him, and The Acts (4:27) sustains this; and Herod's wish to see Jesus perform
a wonder is reconcilable with the desire he had
at another time to see him (Luke 8:9; 23:8),
but is not consistent with the statement made
by the Pharisees to Jesus (13:31) that Herod
wished to kill him. When before Pilate the
Luke and the John both say some colloquy en
sued, but the Matthew (27:14) and the Mark
(15 :5) say he stood mute save as to one ques



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 409
tion (Ps. 38:13; Isaiah 53:7), as the Luke also says he was mute before Herod.
5. No person save Pilate interfered in be
half of Jesus, or even displayed moderation. It has been suggested that Pilate was at enmity with the Jews (Josephus, ''Wars" 2:9), and did not wish to oblige them, whatever he may have thought as to Jesus. Another per
son who may be said to have interfered was a man who was with Jesus at the time of his
arrest, and the John Gospel tells us that this
was Peter, a Galilean. The incident of Pilate's wife, which seems to have caused him to pronounce Jesus a righteous man, was a dream, and is told only by the Matthew. 6. But the Luke (23:27) says a multitude
followed Jesus as he went to execution, and also women who ''wailed and lamented him,"
but the other gospels do not tell this. The
John says that John and the mother of Jesus and Mary Magdelen, with two other women,
were by the cross at the execution ; but this is
positively contradicted by the Matthew (27: 56) and the Mark (15:40), which say Mary Magdalen with other women of Galilee were
"afar off," and the Luke says the women of
Galilee "stood afar off." The Luke (23:48)
further says "all the multitudes" who came to



410 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the scene "returned, smiting their breasts." In
that narrative we are told that it was ''the
women that followed with him from Galilee"
who "stood afar off," with "all his acquain
tances," but it is not stated what became of
the "daughters of Jerusalem" (Luke 23:28). 7. The three synoptics agree that the
centurion was agitated, as well as others, and
two of them say he declared Jesus the son of
God, but the Luke says he declared Jesus a
righteous man. That the disciple John did
not write the John Gospel may well be inferred
from the fact that this remarkable confession
is omitted from it, though John was standing
near the cross, and the others do not seem to
have been there, but the confession bore no
fruit so far as even the care the centurion
might have taken of the corpse of Jesus.
8. In any case it seems that Jesus suf
fered with the consent of the people of Jeru
salem; the boisterous consent of the mass of them ; and that nought he had done or said had gained him a single friend or sympathizer
there who had the courage to speak in his be
half. In the several incidents of his arrest
and trial and execution, not a single Judean came forward to help him. And this though
a few days before he had raised a man from



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 411
death to life within two miles of the town,
according to the John; which asserts that this prodigy caused many Jews to believe on him
(11:45; 12 -9? ii)j ai^d even the priests and Pharisees to acknowledge his miraculous power (11:47). On the contrary the Matthew and Mark and Luke tell of the mocking and reviling
of the spectators while he was suffering, and
the Luke adds that the soldiers joined in this.
That lots were cast for his garments (Ps. 22:
18) all the gospels agree. Even the thieves
crucified with him, in due accord with the
Jeremiah (48:27), taunted him, for the averment that one of them repented or remonstrated with the other, made by the Luke, cannot be
taken against the silence of the John and the
assertion of the Matthew (27:44) and the
Mark (15:32) that both reviled him; but in
the Genesis (40:13-14) Joseph asks the MaShek-ah to remember him when he goes unto Pharaoh.
9. Jesus was buried very privately, and by one man, though the John musters another man for the occasion; but both were perhaps
rich (Isaiah 53:9) for that was the require
ment. And this statement of his burial is in
strange contrast with that of Stephen, shortly after, for he, though murdered by a maddened



412 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
populace, was ''buried by devout men/' who,
there in Jerusalem, ''made great lament over him'' (The Acts 8:2) ; and this though Stephen had no fame as "prophet," had not raised the dead, nor walked on water, or been acknowl
edged by a voice from the sky as the son of God, or had his death been signalized by earth
quakes, unnatural darkness, risings of the
saints, &c. ; so that Jesus must have been con
sidered in a very odious aspect as compared with Stephen, though certainly the heavens
opened at the death of the latter. The fear of seeming to be in open sympathy with Jesus probably kept his timid disciples away from
the cross and from attention to his dead body,
and yet a few days later the Luke (24:53)
says they were continually in the temple prais
ing God. Surely such prodigies as occurred at the death of Jesus, when Earth quaked and rocks were rent (i K. 19:11), when the dead came out of their graves (Dan. 12:2), and the
"veir' or Ma-Sach of the temple was torn
(Isaiah 22:8), culminating in the admission of
the centurion that this was the Son of God,
would seem sufficient to bring out the entire
population of the awe-stricken town to the
burial, and that his tomb would instantly have
been thronged by devotees. Even fear could



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 413
not have prevented this, for it seems the chief
priests and Pharisees "feared the multitude"
(Mat. 21:46). But during the succeeding night
and the following day, and the second night, no one, not even his mother, nor the women who saw him buried, seems to have gone to his grave, even though the Mosaic law (Deut. 21
22-23) required that anyone ''hanged on a
tree" should be buried the same day. The
prodigies were the most wondrous in the his
tory of the world, if we take them as related in the Matthew, but they seem to have left no
impression on the spectators that resulted in
any action on their part, and the Luke says
they went back beating their breasts, while the
Matthew (2y :63) says the next day the Jewish
authorities called Jesus a ''deceiver" and had a guard set to watch the body from being stolen. But what could be expected of the
multitude who passed through this frightful
experience when his disciples, who had seen him do the most wondrous things, and who
had repeatedly avowed their belief in his
divinity or divine mission, at his arrest, "all
forsook him and fled?" (Mat. 26:56; Mark 14:50); nor did they even attend his burial;
and hence one is driven to conclude that they
did not know of his miracles and prodigies, and



414 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
did not believe on him, or else that they were
differently constituted from any sort of hu
manity that now exists.
10. It is quite natural for the intelligent
to doubt the account of the nativity of Jesus as told in the Matthew and the Luke, and nowhere else alluded to in the New Testament.
Marvelous accounts of the birth of Buddha,
Zeus, Apollo, Shemuel, Mosheh, and others,
prepare one for that of Jesus. Is it not like
wise probable that the pathetic incidents of the
Crucifixion, nowhere referred to in the New
Testament outside the Gospels, should pro
ceed from the pious design to conform these
to the appropriate passages at hand in the
Hebrew Scriptures ? Pathetic stories were told
of the death of Osiri, Adonis, Heracles, Prometheos, Abeshalom, and others. Morbid de
votion exists upon pathos.



CHAPTER II
WHAT WAS THE OFFENSE OF JESUS?
I. The incidents of the Crucifixion, so
heartless, so inhuman, so opposite to social ex
periences save in the most fanatical periods,
can scarcely be reconciled with other events of
contemporary annals, unless, indeed, Jesus pur
sued a career of which we have not all the par
ticulars. Thus, when, shortly after, Peter
cured a lame man in the streets of Jeru
salem, the incident is said to have so en
deared him to the populace that it was a
guarantee of protection to him from the
authorities, and to his companion John also (The Acts 4:21). This result cannot be as
signed to an increase of the number of Chris
tians, or Galileans as they were called, as we
see that Stephen was stoned a little later; but
it attests the appreciation of the populace of
such a benefactor. And at Lystra, in Ly
caonia, when Paul cured a cripple there, a few years later, the populace at once hailed both him and his companion as ''gods," and



4i6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
even against the protests of the two could
barely be restrained from offering to them
sacrifices as Jupiter and Hermes (The Acts 14:18-43). The cure by Peter engrosses the space of twenty-six verses of one chapter and almost as many of another to tell of it and of
its popular effects. The Luke, which some
suppose w^as written by the same author, and
which alone records the raising from death by
Jesus of the boy at Nain, appropriates only
seven verses to that stretch of superhuman
power (7:11-17), and scarcely more to the resurrection of the daughter of Jairus (8:41). 2. More strange than the wonder-working
itself is the fact that the miracles of Jesus seem to have left no permanent impression upon anybody who saw them. The considerate
are bound to ask, why did the cure of a single
cripple suffice to protect and popularize Peter
and apotheosize Paul when the giving of life
to three corpses, the walking on water, the
voices of recognition from the sky, &c., &c., did
not suffice to save Jesus from the most igno
minious death? or to lead a single follower to
stand by him in his last hour ? Why were not
the wondrous incidents and works of Jesus remembered by some one or more of the mul
titude who attended the Passover, and pleaded



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 417
at his trial? These miracles and prodigies all occurred within a year or two before, and of some of them it is said the fame of it had gone
forth into all the land (Mat. 9:25; Luke 7:17), throughout all Syria (Mat. 4:24), &c. In the
Luke (2:17) we are told that the wonders even of his birth were known abroad, and it
also tells us (2:47) ^ curious and isolated
story of Jesus astonishing the Sanhedrin by
his precocious wisdom. Indeed, the restoration
of life to Lazarus, after his carcase had put
refied, which no one save the author of the John has mustered courage to relate, had occurred at Beth-Any, about two miles away,
only a little while before, and we are told that
this most remarkable exercise of the '^signs'' of his thaum-urgic power was known to "much
people," and had led many to believe on him
(John 12:9-11); yet even here no one came forward when Jesus was arrested to plead this
extraordinary story in behalf of Jesus ; no, not
even the ungrateful Lazarus himself. It must
seem, to those few who think, that the people
who were present at the resuscitation of the
corpse of Lazarus, and which people shortly
before, at the time of Jesus's entry into Jeru
salem, had borne witness to the miracle (John 12:17), would have been clamorous to save



4i8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Jesus from death; but the}^ did not appear.
Neither came Jairus to testify or interpose, though a "ruler of the synagogue" (perhaps at
Capernaum), who surely was at the Passover, and who could have proven by others as well as himself the signal triumph over nature
which Jesus had wrought in the case of his daughter. Likewise recreant were the many blind and lame and cured demoniacs, and the thousands who fed on the invisible bread and
fish (2 K. 4:42-44), and from whom he withdrew when he saw they were about "to make him king" (John 6:15), for many of these must have been at the Passover at Jerusalem, which the Greek writer of the John wrongly supposes could be observed on Lake Galilee (6:1-4), but which always brought multitudes
to Jerusalem. 3. That there was some degree of moderation and humanity among the Jewish author
ities appears quite forcibly shortly after the
Crucifixion. We learn that the disciples were
seized upon for "filling" Jerusalem with the
assertion that Jesus had risen from the dead
after he had been condemned and executed,
and also for saying that he was the Christ.
Jesus himself is not supposed to have advanced
his claims further than this, nor well could



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 419
(Mat. 26; 63-66), and in his case such claim rendered him "worthy of death." But, in be
half of the arrested disciples, arose one of the
wisest of the Jews, Gamaliel, and spoke gems
of counsel, which "on the outstretched fore
finger of all time should sparkle forever" ; and
he prevailed, for the disciples were merely
beaten and then discharged (The Acts 5:3342). If his wise and noble words could be
advanced to shield the zealous disciples for proclaiming that one who had been condemned
and executed by the authorities was the Christ,
and that he was yet alive, surely the offences
for which Jesus suffered, without a friendly
voice, must have been more exasperating than
the Gospels disclose. It is true that Stephen
was stoned a while after, but he was denoun
cing the authorities and their ancestors a<^ "betrayers and murderers," and in much the
spirit of the violent speech of Jesus in the 23rd chapter of the Matthew. Howbeit, this same
Gamaliel was perhaps present at the trial of
Jesus, but raised no voice in his defense. "All
the chief-priests and elders took counsel against
Jesus to put him to death" (Mat. 27:1).
4. It might be urged that the trial and
execution of Jesus were somewhat hurried, and
took place during the exercises of an observ



420 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
ance which in that time drew "an innumerable
multitude" (Josephus, Antiq. 17:9) to Jerusalem; and these facts might account for the absence of popular demonstrations, or even
private intercessions, in his behalf. But the
statements do not sustain this position. "A
great multitude" (Mat. 26:47; Mark 14:43), or at least "a multitude" (Luke 22:47), wit
nessed his arrest; and "the chief-priests and
the elders and all the council" (Mat. 26:59)
sat together at his trial. "A multitude" were present when he was examined by Pilate (Mat.
27:20, 24; Mark 15:8; Luke 23:13); and "a great multitude of the people (Luke 23:27) and "all his acquaintance" (Luke 23:49) were
at the place of execution. The proceedings
were, as Paul assures us, "not done in a corner" (The Acts 26:26), though unnatural darkness, great earth-quakes, bursting rocks, and dead saints "appearing to many," failed
to impress this worthy at the time. But "all
the people" were willing for the blood of Jesus
to be on their heads ; "all" said to Pilate "Let
him be crucified" (Mat. 27:25, 22). And the
rage of the populace, and their conduct, is not
easily understood if they knew aught of the
miracles he did, for the most simple must then
have considered that one who could heal dis



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 421
eases and raise the dead could not be pained
by stripes and wounds, and that if he could
restore life to others he could restore life to
himself if he was put to death.
5. But the salient fact is to be borne in
mind that neither the signs and prodigies
wrought by or in behalf of Jesus, nor the ex
traordinary incidents of his birth and at his
baptism, nor the recognition of him as Meshia^'h
by the mighty John, availed Jesus aught, nor were even mentioned, in his defense. Yet the
restoration of vitality to a corpse was not a
common occurrence even in that land of the
marvelous; nor the healing of the blind (John
10:32) ; nor did a star usually preside over the
cradle of a child, and no voice from Heaven was ever before known to claim a man as the
son of God (Mark i:ii; Mat. 3:17; Luke 3:
22). It is safe to say that, in this day, in no
country of Earth could any man be subjected to a cruel and shameful death who had raised a dead body to life, no matter what doctrines that man might teach or what personal pretensions
he might advance that were not subversive of
law and order. Nay, from the cure of cripples
by Peter at Jerusalem and by Paul at Lystra,
in that very time, it must seem that the people
of that age were not insensible to the merits



422 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
of wonder-workers. Yet we are left with the problem that, conceding all the wondrous state
ments of the life of Jesus, known as they were
(John 11:48; 12:17-19), what enormity could he have been supposed to have committed which drew on him such popular and official wrath? Elsewise, given this wrath and popular fury, what must have been thought by
that people of these claims of his divinity and
miraculous power occurring there in their
midst? And yet the John (11:47-57) would have us believe that the raising of Lazarus
was the action for which the civic and religious
authorities sought to kill Jesus, and even
Lazarus (12:10).



CHAPTER III
THE SILENCE OF PAUL AS TO THE LIFE OF JESUS
1. That the wonderful things done by Jesus and told of him were not urged by anyone to save him from swift condemnation and
the most cruel death is inexplicable. Equally
so is the silence of the writers of the New
Testament espistles as to these statements of
his ''signs/'
2. There is no doubt in the opinion of any
critic that Paul wrote certain of the epistles
ascribed to him. That of Romans, the two
Corinthians, and Galatians are the four which
are thus free from all suspicion. The Philip
pians and the two Thessalonians are generally
admitted by scholars to be his. These are cer
tainly the earliest of the New Testament
canon; almost certainly they antedate the four
gospels. In not one of these epistles, or any
of the fourteen ascribed to Paul, do we hear
a single word concerning the annunciation, or
of Mary, or of the voice and the dove at the baptism, or of Lazarus and the boy of Nain
and the daughter of Jairus.



424 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
3. In the case of Paul this profound
silence is the more perplexing for that he was reared and educated at Jerusalem (The Acts
22:3; 26:4-5). He consented to the stoning of Stephen (8:1). It is more than probable
that he was at the Passover, about the year
30, when Jesus was executed. More than this, Paul had probably seen Jesus ( i Cor. 9 : i ; 2
Cor. 5:16). From his lips Paul had doubtless heard the beautiful saying which is nowhere
cited save in The Acts (20:35) that 'It is
more blessed to give than to receive." Paul
might possibly omit the wondrous incidents of
the career of Jesus when speaking at Jerusalem
or to the Jews, but how could he omit these
in his writings to the Gentiles ? The populace at Lystra was anxious to worship Paul for
merely curing a cripple; those at Melita said
he was a god because he was not killed by a serpent (The Acts 28:6); those at Ephesus found full efficacy in apparel worn by him (19:
12) ; yet Paul never once relates, in letter or
sermon, the wonders Jesus wrought or that were wTought for him, which, it must seem
from Paul's own experience, would most easily
have brought these peoples to a realization of
the divine nature of his master.
4. On the contrary, it was not these events



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 425
and incidents that Paul relied on, asserted, or
maintained. He never once cites any sign or wonder wrought by or for Jesus. Paul speaks
of or alludes to, more than once, his own
thaumaturgy (2 Cor. 12:12), but positively refuses to discuss any save those "signs"
wrought through himself by the help of Jesus (Rom. 15:18-19). If any controversy or re
port was current in his day, as to the miracles
worked by Jesus, Paul had no contention as to them, nor ever mentions them. It was for
touching the resurrection of the dead, both the
just and the unjust, that he was called in ques
tion by the Jews (The Acts, 23:6; 24:15-21)
or for declaring that Jesus was arisen (25: 19) ; or for urging the Jews to repentance and good works (26:23); or for teaching that "the Hope of Israel" was extended to
the Gentiles (28:20, 28). 'If Christ be not risen," he declared, "our preaching is vain"
(i Cor. 15:14); and within eleven verses
he formulates his whole creed of salvation
and all the gospel he taught (i Cor. 15:1
11); and in this there is the central assertion
of the physical revivification of Jesus as the
seal of his divinity (Rom. 1:4), as well as evi
dence of the bliss or woe in the physical na
ture that would attach to mankind after death.



426 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Paul's epistles were doubtless written between A. D. 50 and 60; about which latter year he
was sent to Rome; and scarcely any scholar
pretends that the four gospels as we now have
them were composed so early as that. Paul's
creed was therefore the first or orginal written
creed of Christianity.
5. Indeed, it might seem that Paul had heard of the signs and wonders which had begun to form as an aureole around Jesus, and
in this light we may understand his clear
declaration that he ''will not dare to speak of
any things save those which Christ wrought through him," and that he has his glorifying
in Christ Jesus ''in things pertaining to God"
(Rom. 15 : 17-18) ; not those pertaining to men, such as raising dead folk, curing demoniacs, healing cripples, and the like. This seems a
protest, when coupled with his silence as to the
miracles, &c., against the stories of prodigies which were being related about Jesus, and might seem a repudiation of them. 6. But the authorships of all the books of
the New Testament are disputed or not sub
stantiated save the seven as aforesaid which
are conceded to Paul. From the main point of
view it is better that these other books should
not have been written bv those who knew



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 427
Jesus and were associated with him, and who
were familiar with the incidents of his hfe,
than that they should have been written by
those who knew him, and knew the incidents, yet remained silent as to them. Thus, if we
say that James and Jude, John and Peter,
wrote the epistles attributed to them, their
silence is even more perplexing than that of
Paul. The four were the close friends of Jesus
James and Jude being his brothers. Peter had
seen Jesus walk on the sea (Mat. 14:28-29); he and John, with James the son of Zebedee,
were witnesses of the revivification of the
daughter of Jairus (Mark 5:37-40; Luke 8: 51*) ; and the same three witnessed the trans
figuration, saw Moses and Elijah conversing
with Jesus, and heard the voice out of the cloud which said "This is my beloved Son"
(Mat. 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36). More than this, James and Jude, to whom cer
tain epistles are attributed, as brothers of
Jesus, though never perhaps his followers
(John 7:5), must have been familiar with the
events of his birth and works, and the marvels
which attended his death. Yet in neither the
* "Put them all out" is an interpolation of Ivuke 8; 54,
omitted in the Revised Edition. Luke's interpolator seems to have followed 2 Kgs. 4:33.



428 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
epistle of James, nor that of Jude, or i Peter,
or the three of John, or in the Apocalypse by
John, is there any allusion to the nativity or
the miracles, or any event in the career of
Jesus. In 2 Peter we have only one of these (i:i6-i8), extracted doubtless from writings
which had become "Scriptures" (3:16), per
haps a century after ''the fathers fell asleep"
(2:4), and when Christ's second coming and "the last days" were so discounted as to require new arguments (2:8-9); ^or Origen in the
third century is the first who refers to 2 Peter,
pronouncing it "doubtful."
7. In "The Acts" Peter is said to have declared that Jesus wrought many works and mighty wonders and signs (2:22); or, as put
in another place (10:38), went about doing good and healing demoniacs ; and by using the word "powers" Paul may also more than once
seem to refer to these; but there is no specific mention of any miracle performed by Jesus in the New Testament apart from the four
gospels.
8. It may be urged that the epistles are
admonitory and exhortatory; pastoral; stim
ulating faith in facts already known to all
Christians, if not to all the world. This view
is not, however, supported by the recapitula



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 429
tion of ancient history set forth in the nth
chapter of Hebrews; or by the speeches of Stephen and Peter and Paul in The Acts; by
Paul's several reports of his own history; all
of which set forth more or less the exploits of
ancient or new heroes and saints; statements which must have been familiar to the Jews to whom they were told. The single earthly
achievement of Jesus, claimed for him in these
speeches, save those ascribed to Peter, or in
any of the epistles, is that he had arisen from
the tomb; a doctrine which seems to have
originated in Ps. 16:10, where ''thy ""Hasid"'
was not to see Sha'^h-ath. This averment is
made frequently; insomuch that it is the more
remarkable that the assertion is lacking that
he had raised up others from the dead; particularly as, though it may have been known
to the Jews, his ''power" in this respect could not have been known to the Gentiles unless
preached by the apostles. Indeed, to din into
the ears of the Jews that Jesus had arisen, after they had condemned and executed him,
never failed to exasperate them ; whereas, had
they been merely reminded of the humane
deeds and lofty logia of Jesus, the effect on
them might have been more persuasive. Cer
tainly this latter would be the method of a



430 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
prudent evangelist who at this day sought converts among the Jews.
9. Besides, that was an age when achievements in the unnatural or supernatural were
readily accredited to holy and even to prom
inent men, and were easily believed by the mul
titude. Tacitus, Josephus, Plutarch, Suetonius,
and other cultivated persons, who lived about
that time, had faith in or at least recorded
prodigies and magical works. And a theology
which depended so much as that of Christianity on the merits of one personage must neces
sarily have its full share of these. But it is
curious to note that in its very earliest stage of propagation the averment of them in the
case of Jesus is absent from writings which
came from or are accredited to those who were
closest to him, and found only in later accounts by gospel authors whose names are wholly
supposititious. As for Paul it might appear
from his own ardent avowal that had he ever
heard of these prodigies done for Jesus and by him he (Paul) would not have hesitated to use them for the greater glory of God (Rom. 3: 7-8) ; and his silence about them comes with
the force of absolute denial.



CHAPTER IV
THE SILENCE OF JESUS AS TO HIS BIRTH
1. To these facts must be added the silence
of Jesiis himself touching the wonders of his
birth and baptism ; to say naught of the silence
of his mother, and that of the people of Naza
reth and Beth-Le'^hem. Jesus never once
refers to any of the glorious incidents recorded
in the first two chapters of the ]\Iatthew and
the Luke. It does not appear that he ever
visited Beth-Le^'hem. Even the humble mother who bore him, who had been distinguished by Almighty God, Creator of the Universes, above
all the mortals of this world, is spoken to or
treated by her divine son with austerity, if not
rudeness (Alat. 12:46-50; Alark 3:31-35; Luke
8:19-21; John 2:4; 19:25-27), on every occasion of their recorded meetings. 2. And why should Jesus be dumb as to
the annunciation and nativity? Was it possible for him not to have known of them ? He
even fails to assert them when at Jerusalem
his influence or usefulness was sought to be



432 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
destroyed by their terming him a Samaritan (John 8 :48) . His mother had ''pondered them in her heart" (Luke 2:19), and surely she could not have withheld from him the knowl
edge of the visit of angels to her, or the
obesiance and gifts of the wise men to his
cradle. If, indeed, it were at all probable that
she failed to supply him with this information, some surviving shepherd at Beth-Le'^hem, had
Jesus gone there, must have been fully as communicative of what wonders had been seen
and heard at his birth as the shepherds were
to others at the time (Luke 2:17-18). It can
not be that the authors of the Matthew and Luke could know of these amazing occurrences,
and Jesus not know, and certainly their ac
counts are too widely variant for him to have told more than one of them. But no one ever mentions the subject to him, and he never
mentions a syllable of it to his audiences or
to his followers; no, not even to the beloved
disciple, if we are to ascribe the John Gospel
to him, for the dead silence of that treatise,
like that of the Mark, shows that neither of
the writers thereof could have heard, and then
omitted, the most signal evidences of their
master's divinity. This would be the more
notable as to John, if he wrote the John



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 433
Gospel, since the mother of Jesus, after his
death, dwelt with John (John 19:27), and was more likely to ''ponder them in her heart" and
relate them after the marvelous terrors of the
Crucifixion and Resurrection of her son had
confirmed or illustrated them. At the return
from the Ascension, when she and her other sons were present (The Acts i :i4), and when the mystery was fulfilled and crowned, an
occasion was offered highly suitable for her
to have told the origin of that one in whose name the assemblage had met; yet she pre
served her peace; so that it may be she did
not even tell her son Jesus or the disciple he
loved; in which case it cannot be that the
authors of the Matthew and the Luke got their
variant narratives from her.
3. Why Jesus failed to avail himself of the marvels of his birth, if he knew them, may be
due to his meekness or modesty; though this view is not compatible with assertions he made
of himself. But as the story of his birth has
been of such immense value to the Church for
eighteen centuries, as it has been so efficacious
in its appeal to human admiration and sym
pathy ever since it was promulgated, it would
seem that he could have used it to great ad
vantage in his own preaching. It cannot be



434 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
said that if the story had come from his own Hps his hearers would not have beHeved him,
since it is imphcitly beHeved by countless millions when it comes from two authors whose
very names are not subscribed to it, and who must have gotten it at second hand; who recorded it many years after it happened, and
which two authors are at positive discord as
to most of its details. It cannot be that he was not bold enough to make it known, for, though
represented as now and then fleeing or hiding
from the Jews (Mat. 12:15-16; John 5:13-16;
8:59; 10:39; 1 1 -8. 54; 12:36), yet in the John we are told how he avowed to them ''Before Abram was, I Am," "I and my Father are one,'' "The Father is in me and I in Him";
while, at his trial, though the Luke (22:67
70) makes him evasive, the other two synoptics say he declared he was the expected Christ
(Mat. 26:63-64; Mark 14:61-62). He claimed that the prophets and Scriptures would be ful
filled in his death (Mat. 24:54-56), but he never pointed to the annunciation and the inci
dents of his birth as connected with such ful
fillment, though a child born of a virgin,
spoken of in the Isaiah, is one central fact
which connects Jesus with such prophecy.
That Jesus did not know aught of the theo



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 435
phany is a postulate which to most Christians
presents more difficulties than to say that he
knew it and failed to allude to it; yet his si
lence as to it, his harshness to his mother, the
unbelief of his brothers (John 7:5), &c.,
strongly indicate his ignorance of it, or theirs.
4. Greater, perhaps, are the difficulties
which press on us if it be supposed that his
mother had forgotten or become indifferent to
those wonders. The great things done to her (Luke 1:49) had been specified by the angel
Gabriel, even to the name of the son that was
to be born, and the throne of David which that son was to occupy (Luke t 131-32, 35). ''The Magnificat" which she sung and the sayings
she kept in her heart (2:51) fully imply that she was aware of the glorious future which
awaited her son. From the part, however,
which she took in the life of Jesus it must seem
that Mary could not have at all realized what
her illustrious function had been. It is and
must ever be a lasting regret that the inspired
authors made such scant notice of the "Mother
of God," since her cult is at this day more
fervid perhaps than that of her son. Apart
from the narratives in the Matthew and the
Luke of the annunciation, &c., she comes only
once in view in each of the synoptics, once in



436 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the Acts, twice in the John. She and her
other sons went with Jesus from Cana to Capernaum, but that she was not accustomed
to attend his ministry is certain from the sol
itary and pecuhar account of the one instance
that is recorded (Mat. 12:46-50; Mark 3:31
35; Luke 8:19-21). Then we have the extraordinary evidence that "even his brothers
did not beheve on him'' (John 7:5); a fact which would seem to prove beyond dispute that
their mother had never revealed to them that
family history which leads many millions at
this day to believe Jesus to be God. It was
after the crucifixion that she and his brothers
appear among the converts (The Acts, i :i4).
5. And if the people of Nazareth had ever
heard of the Incarnation they certainly had
forgotten that most wondrous event in human
annals. When Jesus ventured to preach there he offended them (Mat. 13:54-58; Mark 6:1
6) ; and from the Luke we learn that their
wrath was aroused for that he claimed the
Christhood, and that they took him out to kill
him for this pretension (4:16-31). It is the
Luke w^hich locates the annunciation at Nazar
eth; and the visit of Gabriel must have been
very secret, and kept very confidentially, else
the people there could not have been so ex



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 437
asperated, perhaps so astonished, at Jesus's
claim. His mother, we infer, did not dwell at
Nazareth at the time of this visit there, but
all his sisters did, and the inhabitants of the
village knew all the family, yet seem wholly
ignorant of the theophany or any peculiarity
of the divine group. In this connection must be noted the strange testimony of the Mark
(6:5) that Jesus "could do no mighty work
there,'' and no reason for this inability is given
by that authority; but the Matthew positively
traverses this statement by saying ''he did not many mighty works there," implying that he
did some of these, the partial failure being
"because of their unbehef (12:58) ; a reason
at general discord with the purpose of "signs,''
as it was these that Jesus relied on (John 4:
48) to convince even John the Baptist (Luke 7:22), and the express motive given for the
raising of Lazarus, which was to make the
disciples and the multitude believe he (Jesus)
was sent from God (John 11 : 14-15, 42). But in the Mark (6:6) we find that at Nazareth
Jesus "marvelled at their unbelief" ; a fact re
ferable to his knowledge that they knew of the
theophany, if this can be supposed in the teeth
of the fact that the author of the Mark himself
does not appear ever to have heard of it.



438 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
6. As for Beth-Le'^hem, and its inhab
itants and shepherds, though the village was
only six or seven miles from Jerusalem, no
one there ever came forward to follow Jesus,
or to bear witness in his behalf as to the superhuman wonders which occurred at his birth
there. The slaughter of so many ''innocents" by order of Herod (Mat. 2:16) might have
recalled Jesus, though painfully, to their mem
ory, at least as giving to their village the
celebrity of Jerusalem, which in the days of
human sacrifices had been filled with the ''blood
of innocents" (Jere. 19:4). So, they knew of
the visit of men of the East, no doubt, of
which their scriptures had a parallel somewhat
in the visit of the "ambassadors of the princes of Babylon" to see the "wonder" done in
Hezekiah's time (2 Cliron. 32:31 ; 2 K. 20:12),
and which cost him his sons (20:18).*
* The Sephar-im (trans, "letters") sent to "^Hezekiah (2 K. 20:12), which showed these "letters" his treasures, were easily understood as Sophos or "wise" men by the Greek writer of the I\Iatthew.



CHAPTER V
THE FAILURE OF JESUS TO IMPRESS HIMSELF
1. And what success had Jesus during his lifetime? His preaching is beheved to have extended over a period of about three years. He had taught the most humane precepts; though it must be conceded he was at times fiercely denunciatory; he had led a chaste life;
he had healed the sick, the mad, the blind, the
lame; he had raised from death to life three
persons; he had controlled the laws of nature
by walking on the sea and by stilling the storm he had even been spoken to once from the clouds and once "out of Heaven/' 2. It must seem that the giving life to
one person, who had b)een dead so long that
putrefaction had set in (John 11:39), i^ ^^at were all he did, would suffice to carry con
viction of his superhuman character or at least
his superior merits. Such certainly would be
the effect of the reversal or control of the laws
of nature by anyone in any part of the world in any age. And this particular wonder was



440 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
not wrought ''in a corner" (John ii 141 ; 12:9
II, 17-18), though neither the three other gos
pels, or Peter, James, Jude, Paul, or any other canonical writer whatever, has noticed it or alluded to it.
3. Alike notorious as this extraordinary miracle of Lazarus is the prodigy recorded in the John (12:28-31) which happened within Jerusalem or near that town. "The multitude stood by and heard it," says the Revised Version; and they could not have misunderstood
the voice or words, for Jesus told them that it
came ''for their sakes." It is both strange and
unfortunate that this most astonishing occur
rence is wholly omitted by all the other writers of the New Testament. Even more strange,
however, is that, at the conclusion of this
wondrous scene, Jesus found it necessary to
hide from the multitude that heard the "voice out of Heaven," and for the reason that they
still "believed not on him" (John 12:36-37), even though the voice out of Heaven had spoken to him "for their sakes"; and the
monstrous reason given for their unbelief is
that God had blinded their eyes and hearts in
order that they should not believe.
4. But with all these remarkable evidences of his superhuman power, and of the recogni



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 441
tion of him by the Deity; all occurring in a petty country of ten thousand square miles;
the success of the personal ministry of Jesus
comes to us in precise figures which amaze by
their limitation. All his converts or followers only numbered one hundred and twenty (The Acts 1:15); all could assemble in one house
(2:2) ; all were from Galilee (i :ii ; 2:7) ; and of this little congregation the most eminent of
its leaders were two ''unlearned and ignorant
men" (4:13). This census was just after the Ascension, and at that observance of Pentecost
which doubtless brought them to Jerusalem.
The assertion of Paul (i Cor. 15:6) that,
arising from death, Jesus '"'appeared to above fivt hundred brethren," is not elsewhere recorded; and not even repeated by himself when he had occasion to do so (The Acts 13:31);
while it conflicts with the "all" of The Acts
(2:2), and could not have been known at the time of its occurrence to Paul, else he would
not just subsequently have "breathed theatenings and slaughter" against a brotherhood so
divinely favored; and besides, on questions of
fact which he conceived as necessary to "the
glory of God," Paul frankly admits (Rom. 3:
7) that he is not to be relied on.
5. A number of passages in the four



442 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Gospels declare that many believed on Jesus.
These are more generally found in the John,
though it seems (12:37) ^^^o to contradict
them all; while it is in this Gospel that most frequent mention is made of the hiding of
Jesus, or his escaping from the Jews, whose determination to kill him is often averred in
the narrative.
6. It may well be reckoned that Jesus
reached his highest point of popularity or suc
cess at the time of his "public entry" into Jeru
salem. This event is told in all the four Gospels (Mat. 21:1-16; Mark ii:i-ii; Luke
19:29-44; John 12:12-19). The ''multitude'' which the three synoptics say sung Hosannahs
to Jesus are all claimed by the Luke to have
been ''disciples." The John says the populace went out of the town to meet Jesus because he had raised Lazarus from death; but the
Matthew contradicts this statement, and im
pliedly the whole Lazarus story, or at least its
prior occurrence at Beth-Any, two miles away,
by the notable remark that "all the city" asked
as to Jesus "Who is this?" and this wide dif
ference may arise from the idea of the John
that Jesus dwelt or ministered about Jerusalem,
while the synoptics keep him nearly all the
time in Galilee. In any case this effort of Jesus



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 443
or his biographers to identify him with the
Zechariah (9:9) figure led by its gleam of suc
cess to that riot in the temple (Mat. 21:12;
Mark 11:15-18; Luke 19: 45-47; also John 2:14-16) which rightly aroused the civic au
thorities, for Jesus was then a law-breaker.
7. In the John (6:66) we find that at one
time, owing to the lofty claims of Jesus, "many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.'' This statement conflicts with the account that the day before Jesus had wrought two great miracles, that of walking on water, and that of feeding five thousand people with
five loaves and two fish (2 K. 4:42-44); the former of which is related in the Matthew and
Mark and John, and the latter by all the four.
And the "falling away'' also conflicts with the story the John alone tells (6:15) that because
of the feeding of the five thousand in such manner the people were about to "take him by force and make him a king'' ; and why should any fall away tmder such circumstances ?
8. Curious, too, is the failure of Jesus to
acquire the following of John the Baptist. If the two were cousins ; if the missions of the
two was a divine sequence; if John baptised
Jesus; if the prodigies of that ceremony were seen and heard by John ; if he had pointed out



444 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
to those about him that Jesus was ''the Lamb
of God who taketh away the sins of the world"
(John 1 :32-34), or even the modified statement
made at ^non (John 3:25-30), it must seem
that, not only the disciples of John, but that
subordinate himself would have joined Jesus.
On the contrary, years later, wc find his sect
disputing with Jesus (Mat. 9:14; Mark 2:18;
Luke 5:33); that they had different practices
or rites, and that years and years later they
still formed a separate sect (The Acts 18:25;
19:3). And this latter statement is confirmed
by the message to Jesus from John, then in
prison at the close of his career, asking of
Jesus whether he was the one who was to come
to redeem Judea (Mat. 11:2-3; Luke 7 : 18-24) ;
to which Jesus did not reply by reminding John
of the marvels of the baptism or of his own
personal obesiance to him (Jesus) as "the
Lamb of God," &c. Hence the connection be
tween the two seems to limit itself to the bap
tism of Jesus by John. And the effort of the
John Gospel in this matter seems to be to get
the sect of John, many years later, to join that
of Jesus. This view derives support from the
fact that neither Paul's nor any of the other
epistles allude to John, though in The Acts



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 445
(13:24-25; 19:4) Paul is recorded as speaking of him.
9. And we have seen that ''even his brothers did not beheve on him" till perhaps after the Crucifixion and Resurrection and Ascension. They are never named among the dis
ciples or followers. Their adherence was
doubtless gained by the resentment they felt
at the execution of their brother; not by his
miracles or by his teachings, or by the won
ders wrought at his birth and in his behalf.
10. The seventy or seventy-two (for the
manuscripts differ) which the Luke (10:1-20) says were appointed and sent forth, and to
whom the devils (v. 17) or spirits (v. 20) were made subject, are not mentioned in the
other Gospels or in the epistles. The story is
evidently imitative of the curious and inco
herent narrative of the Numbers (11:4-35),
where the Iseraelites longed for flesh to eat, Mosheh was in despair, and Jehoah came down
in a cloud, took of the Rua^'h that was upon
himself (v. 25), or upon Mosheh (v. 17),
giving it to the seventy elders, who then proph
esied; but with the flesh Jehoah at the same
time gave the people he sent a great plague
because they ate it, and the place was called
"Graves of the Ta-Av-ah" or ''desire" (comp.



446 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Jere. 2:24; and ""Hav-ah's, Gen. 3:6); the Egyptian being Af or "flesh"; hence Jesus,
acting the part of Jehoah, bids his seventy
when they travel to eat what is set before them
(Luke 10:7-8), and threatens destruction to those who refuse to entertain them. Seventy
two was the number of the conspirators against
Osiris when his brother Set put him to death,
and the later Egyptians identified Set with
Ba-Aal the Iserahte god; hence the original story in the book Numbers seems to antagonise the worship of Osiris. Howbeit, it was not the seventy or seventy-two who met after
Jesus disappeared, but the twelve, less Judas
(The Acts 1:12-14).
II. If we allow that the terror inspired
by the severe proceedings against Jesus caused dismay among his craven disciples, and their
desertion the night of his capture, we find
(Luke 24:52-53) the doubtful statement that
they mustered sufficient courage to return to the temple after he parted from them, and were there continually "praising God" ; and
Peter, fifty days after the Ascension, spoke
very openly and boldly (The Acts 2:6, 14) in
Jerusalem, and soon "filled" the town with his
teaching (5:28). Nor can it well be that the
main body of the converts of Jesus had gone



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 447
back into Galilee, as naught of that appears,
and the number seems explicitly stated to em
brace the entire sect as present at the Pentecost meeting when the Spirit came upon all of them. Moreover, the astonishing prodigies
which occurred at the Cricifixion and Resurrection, such as two mighty earthquakes, the appearance ''to many" of saints from the grave, the unnatural darkness of three hours,
the reappearance of their Master for a period of some days, &c., must not only have tended
to keep his followers in line, but also to bring
in recruits; else these wondrous phenomena
were a waste of energy, and of no practical purpose at the time, though arguments more
potent for the conversion of sinners are rarely
presented. It seems true, however, that his
own selected twelve, all but one of whom are now our leading saints, "forsook him and fled" when Jesus was caught, though they more than any other men who ever lived had less reason to doubt him, as they had witnessed the divine
manifestations in his behalf, had been present
at his many reversals of physical processes, and
listened to the lofty sentiments he uttered (The
Acts 10:39) ; and yet even the vehement Peter,
the beloved John, the ambitious James, were
no whit truer than the cripples he had cured



448 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
or the hungry he had fed or the dead he had
raised to hfe; and yet it would be unfair to
a whole people to place their moral standard
as low as that of Peter who denied him, or that
of I-Skar-iot who was Sechar or ''hired"
(Zech. 11:13), ^^d then cast the thirty pieces
to the potter (v. 14).
12. It has been herein observed how easily Peter made converts by curing a cripple, and how Paul and Barnabas w^ere beheved at Lystra to be deities because the former did the like. It may also be noted how Simon the Magician, though he merely practiced sorceries at Samaria, was given heed to by all, ''from
the least to the greatest" (The Acts 8:9-11).
Great success also crowned there the preach
ing of Phillip, and the miracles he there per
formed, as related in the same chapter; for
Simon himself believed and received baptism.
But the claims for Jesus as to his labors in
that country are conflicting (Luke 9:52-56;
John 4:39-42), and he forbade his disciples to
go there (Mat. 10:5); nor does it seem that any Samaritans were among his followers. In
the after centuries, and even at the present
day, flattering stories have been told of elo
quent "revivalists" who prevailed on many
without the help of miracles; and the most



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 449
famous result attained in this way was that of Peter the Hermit and Walter the Pennyless,
who persuaded the fanatical millions of Eu
rope, and even kings and nobles, to waste their
lives and treasures in a foolish errand; and, if
the tale of Jonah is fact instead of allegory, we may see that even the Shemite mind is open
to persuasion without the miracles of Jesus or the sword of Mo-^'Hammed. 13. Wherefore the surprise with which the thoughtful reader meets the statement that
the whole number of Christians at the close of
the ministry of Jesus, after all his mighty "signs" and "wonders," was only one hundred and twenty! And this number is in accord with his friendless death and unanimous con
demnation ; yielding to us as it does necessarily
an utter reversal of all our ideas of the man,
or of all our ideals of humanity. If the num
ber was multiplied by ten, by an hundred ; yea, by ten thousand ; one must still be left in amaze
ment at the signal failure of a divine person
ality to impress itself on a co-temporary people
and this too in an age when credulity was co
extensive with ignorance, and imong a people
willing for and expectant of divine interpo
sition.
29



CHAPTER VI
SILENCE OF THE EPISTLES AS TO THE LOGIA
1. The marvelous birth and works of
Jesus, and the celestial recognition and ter
restrial phenomena in his behalf, did not suffice,
therefore, first, to save him from civic and popular condemnation and contumely and
death ; nor, second, were these marvels of either
kind set up in his defence at the crisis of the
fate he met with so much anguish as to reproach God for forsaking him; nor, thirdly,
are they remembered or recited in the speeches or writings ascribed to Stephen and Peter, to
John and Paul, to James and Jude ; nor fourth
ly, did Jesus or his mother allude to or recall
to anyone their knowledge of the nativity ; nor,
lastly, did aught that was done for or by him
yield to him any gratifying measure of popular
success during his life.
2. Let us stop then to consider this logia.
3. It might well be expected that these,
or the more striking and original of them,
would be indelibly im.pressed on the memory



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 451
of the apostles, and incorporated in every single
writing of canonic authority. The sayings of
Jesus, however, are most scantily found re
peated, and are almost exclusively confined to the four gospels. In propagating the fame and glory of Jesus, among those who had never seen or heard of him, it would seem impossible
for those who did this to omit the moral senti
ments and social precepts he taught, or perhaps
the severe invectives he pronounced. His
brothers James and Jude, Paul, or others who
were not his disciples, might fail to cite or
quote these; but it is not easy to understand
how or why John and Peter, if thev wrote a
single page, could so fail.
4. We of the after centuries are expected
to obey and follow the words of Jesus in our
faith and in our practices. It must seem that
the proselytes of the first century, who were
certainly in most part without any written ac
count of Jesus, should also have been familiar
ized with his sayings for their guidance and
salvation. But the epistles incorporated in
the New Testament, full as they are of pastoral
exhortations as to rules of conduct, even to
minute domestic details, are singularly sterile
in citations of such exhortations as coming
from the mouth of Jesus. A careful research



452 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
is rewarded perhaps in rare and doubtful cases.
The Romans (13:8), the i Peter (1:22) and the I John (3:11, 23) do indeed quote the new commandment thrice found given by Jesus in
the John only (13:34; 14:12, 17), "that ye love one another"; and the I Thessalonians
(4:9) quotes the "Love thy neighbor as thy
self which Jesus himself quotes (Mat. 22:39;
Luke 10:27-28) from Leviticus (19:18). The James, which nowhere mentions Jesus save in
the opening verse, and one other place, has an
abbreviation of Mat. 5:34-37 (James 5:12), but does not quote the new commandment,
though referring expressly to that of Leviticus
(2:8). The I John seems to refer to the new^
commandment (2:8-10). Peter, in a verbal report (The Acts 11:16), quotes a saying of
Jesus, not found in the gospels, but in The
Acts (1:5), much like the w^ords of John Bap
tist (Mat. 3:11; John 1:33); and Peter also
has allusion to the words of Jesus at Nazareth found in the Luke 4:18 (The Acts 10:38).
Paul, indeed, while he repeats it (Rom. 13:8)
does not know^ that Jesus had ever given it as
a new commandment, or perhaps denies it ; ex
pressly declaring that if there be any other
commandment than those of the decalogue it
is one in Leviticus, which he twice cites (Rom.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 453
13:9; Gal. 5:14). His exquisite chapter on brotherly love (i Cor. 13:), in which he might most appropriately have interwoven the 'Xove ye one another/' wholly omits that saying. 5. The Lord's Prayer is nowhere referred
to as such outside the three synoptics (Mat.
6:9-15; Mark 11:25-26; Luke 11:2-4). The beloved John must have heard this prayer, but the book John does not mention it. The canonic epistles often mention praying and
prayer, and their failure to mention the teach
ing of Jesus as to prayer is not explainable. 6. The Sermon on the Mount (Mat. 5:; Luke 6:20, &c.) is also unknown to other parts of the New Testament. Paul expresses some
kindred sentiments, but he does not ascribe
these to Jesus, nor use the like phraseology.
7. It might certainly be expected that Paul would cite the Golden Rule. Before the time
of Jesus this precept is said to have been ut
tered by Hillel, father or grandfather of the Gamaliel who taught Paul ; but neither as from
Jesus nor Hillel does Paul ever allude to it.
Other of the writers or alleged writers, such
as James, Peter, Jude, John, must have heard
Jesus use the precept, yet they are silent as to
it. Full as all the epistles are of admonition
and exhortation, it would appear that this



454 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
guide to social conduct would be freely used, but only two even of the gospels mention it
(Mat. 7:12; Luke 6:31), and it is these two which in their same chapters report the wise saying as to the mote and beam in the eye.
8. The invectives uttered by Jesus against
Pharisees and others, so frequent in the gos
pels, are not generally pertinent to the epistles,
and silence as to them might thus be accounted
for. An opposite sentiment, ''Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do," found
only in the Luke (23:34), and omitted from
the earlier copies of that book, and probably
an interpolation from the similar expression of Stephen (The Acts 7:60), may w^ell be found missing from the epistles, as it is from
the other gospels.
9. That all the details of the Crucifixion,
as variously told in the four gospels, should be
wholly left in silence by the epistolary authors
is the more singular, since Paul himself must
have been in Jerusalem at the time it occurred
and we know that John and Peter were at the
time in Jerusalem.
10. Two rites or practices of Jesus, bap
tism and the sacrament, are preserved in the
writings of Paul; he or his disciples baptised,
and he also amplifies the words of Jesus at the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 455
Last Supper (i Cor. 11:23-26), which words are given in the three synoptics (Mat. 26:26
28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20); but neither Paul nor the other writers make men
tion of the washing of feet, which the John
gives (18:4-15) at some length, and apparent
ly as a substitute for the story of the sacrament.
11. It really must seem that the authors of the books of the New Testament, other than
the four gospels, knew as little of the logia of
Jesus as they did of the incidents of his life
and death. Had these authors heard these
sayings, or even got them at second hand, it cannot well be doubted that they would have
been both used and useful. Paul, indeed, is
said to have gotten one, not elsewhere found, which he employs with happy effect on this age and perhaps on the proselytes of his own time (The Acts 20:35), ^^^ surely he would have used others had he been familiar with them.
12. If it be answered that most of the
epistles were extant before the gospel narra
tives were written, one reply is that the epistles
written subsequently are equally barren of the
sayings of Jesus. Now, in their ascribed
speeches, Stephen, Peter, Paul, James, show
that they are acquainted with Jewish history



+56 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
and literature, and in the writings of the three
latter there are repeated quotations from and
allusions to these. So with the ''Hebrews,"
and other books of disputed canonicity. In speaking to Jews it might be we could not ex
pect the logia of Jesus to be cited, however im
possible it would be to omit the miracles and prodigies; in speaking to an assemblage of
Gentiles the apostles would have found the
logia to be of great service; and certainly in
writing to or addressing the followers or pros
elytes the sayings of the Master would claim
a place conspicuous above all others. And that
the gospel narratives were not extant would
only supply a more imperative reason for this
latter course.



CHAPTER VII
THE RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION
I. If, however, the sayings and works of
Jesus, and the wonders of his birth, are scantily
quoted or wholly slighted in the writings of the New Testament outside the gospel narra
tives, this is more fully the case as to the awful
phenomena and the pathetic or other incidents
of his death and resurrection and ascension.
This is the less to be wondered over, since the
John Gospel, which says that John was standing by the cross, does not record the darkness
of three hours related by the three synoptics,
or the rending of the temple veil, or the con
fession of the centurion; and the Matthew alone takes note of the mighty earthquake, the rended rocks, and the appearance of the dead
saints; as that gospel also alone tells of the
second earthquake at the resurrection. If John wrote the Apocalypse he might, it would seem, have made use there of these prodigies
in that startling book. Paul was a young man, and must have been at lerusalem when they



458 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
happened, as it was the Passover feast, and he
''an Hebrew of the Hebrews," yet he never alludes to them in any manner. We know
that all the disciples were in or near the town,
and even present at the death of their Master
(Luke 23:49), yet Peter, in none of his
speeches, nor in the epistles assigned to him,
says aught of these wonders. The brothers of Jesus, James and Jude, who wxre in the town
certainly forty days later (The Acts 1 114) do
not mention them in the epistles to which their
names are fixed. Jesus, after the resurrection,
points to his wounds, but not to these prodigies,
as evidences in his behalf.
2. The appalling wonders of the cruci
fixion and of the resurrection could have been
used, it must seem, and with signal effect, by
Stephen and Peter and Paul in their speeches
if, indeed, the populace of Jerusalem had been
so perverse as to hold out against such super
natural evidences; evidences they themselves must have heard or witnessed at the time. In
his speech at Caesaria (The Acts 10:34-43)
Peter had an opportunity to tell an assemblage,
a little distant from the cross and the sepulchre,
of these prodigies, but his claims for Jesus on
that occasion are not immoderate when we con
sider that they are reported by the author of



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 459
The Acts, a generation or two later. And Paul, journeying into more remote parts, in
order to induce men to espouse the new faith,
while he mentions the death and resurrection
of Jesus, wholly ignores the phenomenal features of these, though it must seem that naught better would have served such purpose with
peoples whose several sacred annals were made
up of prodigies.
3. The speech of Stephen is lengthier than
any other left to us by the author of The Acts
(7:), comprising as it does 52 verses. He is
one of the first officials of the new sect when
they organized shortly after the death of Jesus. Stephen must have seen and heard Jesus, and was doubtless familiar with much that had
chanced to him. Stephen's speech is in an
swer to charges preferred by false and
suborned witnesses, who must even have exaggerated what he was teaching; yet his answer shows that he was not spreading the merits and renown of Jesus, but was attacking
the fetishism of the Jews respecting their tem
ple, and thus undermining the authority of
their priesthood. But, while reciting with
some detail the history of their past, and espe
cially incidents in the life of Mosheh, with all
of which his hearers must have been familiar,



46o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
no account of the career of Jesus is given, and
Stephen only claims that Jesus was a predicted
prophet or righteous one, whom, in pursuance
of their usual course in regard to prophets, they had not onty murdered, but had betrayed
their nationality by delivering him to the Ro
mans (Luke 24:20). Stephen not only fails
to recall to his audience any of the wonders at
the death and rising of Jesus, but does not
claim that he had arisen, much less that he had ascended alive to Heaven. 4. An earthquake in Judea was a very rare occurrence; so uncommon, indeed, that those which chanced in the reigns of Uzziah and Jereboam II. were used as a time-mark
(Amos 1:1) and as an illustration (Zech.
14:5); as also Josephus (Antiq. 9:10), who perhaps quotes from the Zechariah. The one
recorded in the Matthew as occurring at the
crucifixion resembles the one told of Elijah (
Kgs. 19:11-12) who was to forerun the Mes
sia^'h (Mai. 4:5), and therefore was entitled to no greater honors; and the one which rolled
the stone from the grave, and the one which
unbolted the prison of Paul and Barnabas at
Philippi (The Acts 16:26), have functions in common. That such phenomena were not fre
quent renders the silence of all the other writers



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 461
as to these two of the Matthew the more per
plexing. If, on the other hand, earthquakes
were frequent at that time in Judea, then these
two lose somewhat their value and significance.
5. As to the other incidents at the cruci
fixion and resurrection, there is a like silence
on the part of all the writers and speakers apart
from the gospel narratives. The ''It is fin
ished,'' told in the John, seems the ''accomplished warfare (Maleah ZebeaJi) of the Isaiah (40:2), and appears in the Revelations
(16:17; 21:6). The "I thirst,'' found in the
John only, might suggest or be suggestive of the same passages of the Apocalypse, but is
referable to Psalms (69:21). The presence, however, of his mother, and his words to her, told alone in the John, and contradicted infer
entially by the synoptics (Mat. 27:55; Mark 15:40; Luke 23:49), are not confirmed else
where. Neither is the piercing of his side by
the soldier with a spear w4iich the John alone
tells, and so contradictory of the remark of the centurion and "those who were with him"
(Mat. 27:54; also Mark 15:39; Luke 23:47).
Neither is the citation by Jesus from the Psalm
(31:5), related in the Luke (23 :46) only. The ''My God, my God," &c., quoted by Jesus from
the Psalm (22:1), and told by the Matthew^



462 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
and the Mark, is not elsewhere noticed. The 'Tather, forgive them," &c., told alone by the
Luke, is not expected to be elsewhere found,
for it is not even in some of the earliest codices
from which we get that Gospel, and its absence
from the Sinaitic and Vatican is fatal to its
authenticity, and it is probably an interpolation borrowed from the words of Stephen in
the later book of The Acts (7:60). The con
fession or conversion of the centurion, his
"'Surely this was the Son of God'' (''righteous
man," the Luke has it), common to the syn
optics, but not in the John, though the disciple John was standing by, would have been power
ful artillery for the evangelists had they known
of it, but their silence implies they were igno
rant of it. The epistles give us no account of
the scenes at the death of Jesus ; not even do we
hear from them of the two thieves (Jere. 48:
27) or the crown of thorns or the inscription
on the cross.
6. It is only in the Matthew (27:62-66; 28:11-15) that we have any mention of the
sealing of the sepulchre and the setting of the
watch. It was doubtless an early, but not an
immediate, claim of his followers that Jesus
had arisen bodily from the grave; not imme
diate, else Stephen would have been less



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 463
indignant, and in his speech would surely have triumphantly mentioned it. If the body had disappeared, the reply must have been that his
disciples had stolen it; hence the Matthew's sealing and guarding seems a rejoinder which betokens a local controversy about it, of which
the other Gospels were ignorant.
7. The re-appearances of Jesus are not
mentioned in the Mark, for all scholars agree that that Gospel ends with 16:8; but the young man at the grave said he had risen and gone into Galilee, where they would see him; and
this refers to a remark of Jesus (Mat. 26:32; Mark 14:28), where he said "After I am
raised up, I will go before you into Galilee,"
which probably meant the "region" (Galil-ah)
eastward of Ezekiel's (47:8) Paradise, whence the waters flow to Arabah or Erebus, and the Ge-Aulai (trans, "redeemed") of the Isaiah (62:12); the Egyptian Aalu and Greek Elysium; as this accords with his remark to the
penitent thief (Luke 23:43). The Mark also says the "three women" saw a young man in the tomb; and the Matthew converts him into
a radiant angel, who also spoke to the "two
women," and also that they met Jesus there,
contrary to what the young man and the angel had said. The Luke has a bevv of Galilean



464 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
women at the sepulchre, who see two radiant men, just as Sha-Aul saw two ''men" (Bnoshim) by Kabur-eth Ra'^hel (i Sam. 10:2). The John, however, gives the more cherubim-hke idea of the two angels, and Magdalen saw them, though possibly she saw Peter and John while they were in the tomb; but she also met
and talked with Jesus, who, like the two
cherubs, was not seen by Peter and John, nor by Luke's Peter. The Matthew supplies us with only one appearance of Jesus, and that
was in a mountain of Galilee, as if in harmony
with the Galilah concept; and so the John
leaves him at the Sea of Galilee. But the John
and Luke and The Acts locate appearances of
him in Jerusalem besides those at the sepulchre,
though if the John originally ended, as some
have insisted, with its 20th chapter, that au
thority would be excluded. Paul, pursuing his
theory of a bodily resurrection, cites more ap
pearances than any other writer ; but he surely
did not have this knowledge at the time he was
persecuting Jesus. And among these Paul
says (i Cor. 15:12) Jesus appeared to "the
twelve,'' thus showing his ignorance of the
story of I-Skar-iot, which is nowhere alluded
to by him ; a story told in some detail in all the
Gospels, yet one w^iich the silence of the epis



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 465
tolary writers suggests to be an allegory elab
orated from the Zechariah (11:12-14), where Sechar or ''hire" accounts for one part of his
name, while the name Judas perhaps personifies
the Jews (The Acts 7:52) as treasurer of the
The Seker Boat of Egyptian Inscriptions; supposed in this vol
ume to be the Scair-ah or Goat Barge which carried off Esau and Elijah.
divine word and treacherous to the divine mes
senger; for Paul's statement that Jesus was
''betrayed'' (i Cor. 11:23), considering this
remark of. his about the "twelve," must be
30



466 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
taken in the same sense as Stephen's (The Acts
7:52), and appHed to the Jewish authorities. 8. The Ascension is not mentioned in the
Gospels. The close of the Mark (16:9-20) is
known to be spurious. The "was carried up
into Heaven" of the Luke (24:51) is to be re
jected because not in the oldest (the Sinaitic) Codex. The whole direct and admitted au
thority for the Ascension is therefore limited
to three verses of The Acts (1:9-11); a book which many argue was written in the early part of the second century; but even in that book the speeches of Peter and Stephen and
Paul fail to allude to the astonishing event.
The several notices of Jesus as sitting at the
right hand of God, have no necessary connec
tion with a bodily ascension. Indeed, the He
brews, one of the very latest books, declares
that Jesus "through his blood, entered in, once
for all, into the holy place" (9:12, 24). The Ascension, an event more wondrous than the
Resurrection, is not relied on or mentioned by
the epistolary writers ; and even so late a writer
as the pious interpolator of Josephus (Antiq.
18:3) after the days of Origen, A. D. 185-254,
fails to record this remarkable breach of phy
sical law as among the merits of Jesus; while
in the book of Origen against Celsus the zeal



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 467
ous father seems not to have known of the Ascension. Certainly no averment in support
of the divinity of Jesus could have been more
effective in the evangelization of mankind, and
the silence of Paul as to it, while engaged in
his extensive mission, is certain evidence that
it was not among the earlier beliefs. In truth,
when we find the Matthew (28:17), the Mark
(16:7), and the John (21:1) all leave Jesus in Galilee, while the last authentic words of
the Luke on the subject are ''he was parted from them,'' it might seem as if all the gospel
writers preferred to have it believed Jesus was alive in Galilee (Galah means "Captivity" or
''Exile'') and liable to return at any time to
set up his authority or to "avenge" (Goel, or
as Goel-El) his wrong (Mat. 10:23); though the John treats Jesus as a phantom, which en
ters closed-doors (20:19, 26) and was not to
be touched (:i7). It is not, therefore, to be
expected that the gospels would record the
Ascension of Jesus, bodily or otherwise. The
sole direct authority for the Ascension is thus
found to be The Acts. This latter is believed by many to have been written after the publica
tion of Josephus's Antiquities, A. D. 93, so close is the correspondence with it, and others
place the date of The Acts as late as A. D.



468 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
1 20 or 130. The support we see for its late
date is the fact that the Jews were so scattered
and well established (The Acts 9:2; 11 119; 13:
5, 14-15; 14:1; 17:1, 10, 16; 18:4, 19), since these synagogues show strong colonies, and
this could hardly be true till some time after
the downfall of Jerusalem in A. D. 70. That
Jerusalem is so often alluded to in The Acts, and no mention made of its terrible fate, seems
to show that the book antedates that event; a
point which is difficult to surmount; but if it
was written, as is urged, at Rome, as much as
half a century after the fall of the town, and
by other than a Jew, postulates supported by
the familiarity of the author with Italy and
adjacent parts, the omission of all reference to
the destruction of the town might be accounted
for. Then the assertion that Paul taught for
two years "in the school of Tyrannus" (The Acts 19:10-11) at Ephesus would seem a con
troversial boast which would fetch the date of
the book down, for it is probable that Tyanaeus
is the right name here, since in the latter years
of the first century the famous Apollonius
Tyanaeus, whose thaumaturgy has been so
often compared with that told in the New
Testament, was resident at Ephesus; and in
connection with this remark as to the myster



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 469
ious ApoUonius will be noticed the account of ApoUos at Ephesus which immediately pre
cedes the teaching of Paul ''in the school of Tyrannus" (18:24-28). Indeed it appears feasible to frame such an itinerary of Paul as
is related in The Acts from his own epistles. Whatever the date of the book, however, and
whoever the author, it is certain that it alone
contains any authentic averment of the won
drous event of the bodily ascension of Jesus;
a statement not necessary to sustain the Psalm (16:10), where ''thy "Hasid" is "not to see
She'^h-ath," for the Resurrection responds to
that characteristic, but to rank Jesus with the Jewish Elijah and with the Greek Ganymede or "cup-bearer" (Ma-Shek-ah) or Me-Shia^h.



CHAPTER VIII
THE EARLIER CLAIMS OF CHRISTIANITY
I. The conclusion to be deduced from
these facts of omission is of the most striking
nature. It is not whether miracles were
wrought by Jesus, or that in his behalf prod
igies were exhibited. Still less is it the old
question as to the possibility of the performance
of miracles, or that of the authenticity of prod
igies. The discussion of these problems has no place here, as it has been exhausted long
ago. But the question is, conceding every word and every detail of these wondrous in
cidents to be true, and the truer the more im
perative the question, how could they wholly
escape the knowledge or utterly fail to com
mand the consideration of contemporary writ
ers and speakers who were eagerly engaged in the propagation of a theology which at this
day and for many centuries past has rested its
claims to divine origin and supremacy on these
very incidents ? Nay, more ; writers and speak
ers who, as the intimate associates of and be



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 471
lievers in Jesus, and even his brothers, were
witnesses of and actors in this superhuman drama, and who substitute their own homihes
or relate their own visions in place of confirm
ing the events and iterating the sayings of Almighty God during his visit to and presence
in the world. It must seem that it is to these,
to Peter and John, James and Jude, Thomas and James bar-Zebedee, that we should look
for the history of their Master or brother, though the two former were "unlearned and ignorant men"; and yet it is only the gospel
narrative of John which anyone has accredited to one of these, and no scholar would admit that this metaphysical and ingenious produc
tion, so variant from the synoptic gospels, was
written by a Galilean or Jew, or by an un
learned and ignorant man. No one, indeed, in
the three first gospels, claims their authorship, and the Matthew and Mark and Luke, to whom they are arbitrarily assigned, wxre not, except
Matthew, among the intimates or followers of
Jesus during his lifetime ; and thus the surprise
is the greater that those who actually knew of
these remarkable occurrences should be wholly dumb as to them, and leave them to be told by
those who could only have learned most of
them by hearsay, while these intimate asso



472 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
ciates should write of doctrinal and pastoral
themes. The fact is almost as strange as that,
despite ''the signs and wonders'' wrought by and for Jesus, including the numerous cures he wrought, he was unanimously condemned by
the populace and authorities who knew of these to the most shameful death.
2. It must be, in explanation of this, that
the basic idea of the earliest Christians, at least
down to the time of the destruction of Jerusa
lem, A. D. 70, was not so much the personality
of Jesus as preparation for ''the Kingdom of
Heaven," which was shortly to be established
by his second coming. In the i Corinthians,
doubtless the oldest of the New Testament
canon, Paul speaks freely of this expected
event, and as if it were at hand (i :7-8; 4:5;
7:29-31; 10:11; 11:26). The very resurrec
tion of Jesus was the assurance of this expec
tation, for unless he had risen unto life again he could have no second coming, there would be no "Kingdom of Heaven," no bodily resurrection of others, and "then is our preaching
vain, your faith also vain" (i Cor. 15:
12-24) ; that is to say that the whole Chris
tian or Paulian faith of that early day was
the old hope for "God as Ruler," or the "Kingdom of Heaven," broadened into a hope



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 473
that this might extend to the Gentiles, and
coupled with the averment that Jesus was to precede God as a preparatory messenger
(vs. 23-26). And the general idea was per
haps even more realistic than that manner of
coming which Jesus so liked to describe from
the Daniel (7:13-14), where this coming would
be in the clouds of Heaven, and as Chibar Aenosh or ''glorious man"* who was to come Kerob or "at hand," and have dominion. This
was the creed, the faith, the bond of organiza
tion; and the course to pursue was to lead a
brotherly and blameless life so as to be in
unison with the happy change. Paul seems to have known naught of wonders at the birth
and death of Jesus, or of the prodigies done
for him, or of the Ascension, save the partic
ular fact of the bodily rising, which made Jesus the first who had triumphed over the Kabor or grave; and held that he would soon come
back to reign ; his suflfering having atoned for
the general Earth-curse ; wherefore he was the
promised Me-Shia^'h and Son of God. Upon
these dogmas Paul built the primitive Church.
3. This Messianic hope, however, must
* Not Chi Bar, "like a son," though the play on words is there; and so Gibbor or "mighty," and hence Gabri-El; the classic Mul-Ciber, etc.



474 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
have rapidly abated among the Gahleans of Palestine when the Romans subjugated the country and destroyed their holy city. It was
then that these believers must have turned
more eagerly txD the personality of Jesus. It
was then that they must have insisted that
their calamities and those of the Jews came upon them because the latter had rejected and
crucified him ; in which case of such divine vengeance he must have been the Son or forerunner of God, and must have had manifestations of this, and done works conformant with such a nature. Friction with those who denied
this and these only developed more rapidly the number and superhuman character of the
claims as to him, till at last the two preliminary
chapters of the Matthew and the Luke took shape, and were prefixed. That there were extant previously some accounts of Jesus, and
sayings of his, may well be supposed, since his
sect was firmly established from the Jordan
to the Tiber, and already had the Pauline
epistles and perhaps other literature; nay, had even been persecuted at Rome, though it is
more likely that it was the Palestinians gen
erally of whom Tacitus and Suetonius speak,
that is, Jews and Christians. In any case, my
point is that the personality of Jesus developed



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 475
towards the end of the century, and early in
the next, at which latter time our gospels
probably took their present general form; and
this statement derives strong support, not only
from the fact that late canonic epistles, such
as the Hebrews, fail to specify his miraculous
origin and works and death, but the apostolic fathers nowhere specify them; Clemens Romanus mentioning two miracles of the Old
Testament, but, apart from the resurrection,
not intimating such a power in Jesus; the Barnabas (4:11) saying Jesus did "many wonders and signs,'' and that he ''arose from
the dead, manifested himself to his disciples,
and ascended into heaven," but specifying nothing save this latter; the Polycarp saying
nought of Jesus' manifestations; the Hermas saying nought; and it is only when we reach
the questionable letters of Ignatius that we
hear of the ''incarnation," "birth," and thrice of Virgin Mary, all without particulars, and
then of a great star whereby Jesus was "mani
fested." These books are ascribed to the period between A. D. 100 and 150; Clemens'
writing being claimed as extant a year or
two earlier, and Ignatius a few years after
Clemens; but the particular feature they pre
sent is that, except Ignatius, whose epistles



476 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
are in sore controversy, their authors are as
free from details of Jesus' signs and wonders
as is Paul. They tell, scantily, some of the
logia of Jesus, but my inference is that they were fairly ignorant of what he did and what
was done for him because these had not been incorporated into any gospel as we now have
it till perhaps after the davv^n of the second
century. Nor was there any great need for
this, since the belief in his second coming was
yet implicit outside Palestine, and all the above
except Hermas so declare, and all these writ
ers seem to have dwelt outside Palestine where
the destruction of Jerusalem was causing the
hope to fade, and the increasing personality of
Jesus was taking its place.
4. The Gentiles, taught by Paul the strange doctrine of the Atonement, which we
notice fully in this book, were therefore the
last who held on to the Messianic hope, for Paul had changed the Saviour of the Jews in
to the Saviour of the world (Rom. 5:6-21; i
Cor. 15:3, 21-22). And the fact of the resur
rection was all that was really urged to attest
the Christhood of Jesus; it is this that stands
out in the writings ascribed to the apostolic
fathers as bald and almost as isolated as it
does in those of Paul. This was the Christian



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 477
faith of the first century, since it was strictly
coupled with the second coming or "Kingdom
of Heaven/' Hence it is that Paul is to Chris
tianity what Ezra is to Judaism. Hence it is,
also, that the empty grave of Jesus is the
cradle of Christianity. Christianity was born,
not in a manger, but in a sepulchre. From
that sepulchre have radiated the Star of Beth
Le^'hem as well as the Cross of Constantine;
while it has also yielded to us the most un
scientific dogma of any great religion, namely,
that the physical part of man does not perish
at death, but revives to everlasting bliss or
everlasting woe, as in case of recreant Jews in the time when Maccabeus stood up (Dan. 12:
1-2).



CHAPTER IX
HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT OF JESUS
I. Behind the canonical accounts of Jesus lies a lurid background of history which such
accounts but feebly disclose. Those who con
fine their research to the New Testament cannot be expected to understand the peculiar
conditions and antecedents which gave Jesus
and Christianity to the world. Fortunately
the next generation after him supplied a secu
lar historian, Josephus, who, though credulous and extravagant beyond measure, has thrown
great light on the social or political status of
Palestine in the first century. Most history
is perverted or distorted by the bias or the
purpose of the historian; either that of main
taining or assailing some cause or some pre
tension; or it is inaccurate from ignorance, or
from the sheer impossibility that any fact can
be stated with precision even by those who
witness it. Josephus is heir to all these frail
ties. A writer who states that 115,880 dead
Jews were carried out of one gate of Jeru



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 479
salem, within seventy-five days, during its
siege by Titus (Wars 5:13), cannot be relied on as accurate, though he be present when
events occur, as Josephus was in that instance.
Whatever discredit may attach to his nar
rative, however, we may accept it as approxi
mation to the facts, since he was largely contemporary with and an actor in many of the occurrences he records as taking place during
the first century. He was born at Jerusalem,
A. D. 2)7i soon after the death there of Jesus, wrote the ''Wars" about A. D. 75, the ''Antiquities'' about A. D. 93, and "Against Apion" about A. D. 100. 2. He says, speaking of the times of Arch
elaus, B. C. 4 to A. D. 6, which period is be
lieved to cover the birth year of Jesus, that "a great many set up for kings" (Wars 2:4);
and he repeats this as to the same period in his
Antiquities (19:10) by saying that when "the
several companies of the seditious lighted on anyone to lead them they immediately made
him a king." He also states of the time in
which Felix was governor, about A. D. 60,
"the country was filled with imposters and rob
bers" ; that "imposters and deceivers persuaded
the people to follow them into the wilderness,
and pretended they would exhibit manifest



48o EGYPT AND ISRAEL
wonders and signs" (Antiq. 20:8), and that "there were such men as deceived and deluded
the people under pretense of divine inspira
tion," "who prevailed with the multitude to act like madmen, and went before them into the wilderness as pretending that God would
show them the signals of liberty" (Wars 2:
13). He names several who led these movements, such as Judas of Gamala or Galilee,
also another Judas who raised rebellion in
Galilee; also one Anthrogos, a peasant; then Simon a servant of the great Herod; also "an Egyptian" ; and Theudas, and notably Mena'^h
em. Three of these appear in the New Testament, namely, Theudas and Judas of Galilee (The Acts 5:36-37), and the Egyptian (21: 38). Some of these, Josephus says, assumed or aspired to the royal dignity. Most of them were attacked and put down by the Roman
army of occupation, and not by the native
authorities.
3. The immediate cause of these outbreaks
was the servility in which the Galileans, rather
than the Judeans, felt themselves upon the re
duction of Palestine to a province of the
empire. This occurred after the death of the
first Herod, and during the short reign of
Archelaus. The populace were then enrolled



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 481
for taxation, not as before to and for their
hierarchy of the Temple, but for the Romans.
The rule of Herod, a foreigner, and close ally
of the Romans, had been obnoxious to the Gal
ileans; but Herod built the temple, tolerated
their peculiarities, and under him the country
was prosperous.
4. Galilee, the district most turbulent, up
on the imposition of Roman rule, at once
produced a leader in the person of Judas. He
is severally called "the Gaulonite,'' ''of Galilee,"
and ''of Gamala," by Josephus; Gaulonitis be
ing the district just north and east of Lake
Galilee, and Gamala a town shortly to the east
of that water. Josephus considers that Judas
founded a fourth philosophic sect (Antiq. 18:
i), as distinguished from the Pharisees, Sad
ducees, and Essenes. It seems, however, from
his three or four notices of Judas, that it was
not so much a philosophic sect as it was a
political and religious sentiment. "These men,"
he says, "agree in all other things with the
Pharisee notions; but they have an inviolable
attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord." He then tells that
with intense fortitude they braved or received
danger, pain, death; thus showing that they
must have come in conflict with the authorities.
31



482 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
In another pari of the same chapter he states
that this Judas and one Sadduc "both said that
this taxation" [by the Romans] ''was no better
than an introduction to slavery, and exhorted
the nation to assert their Hberty." (Antiq. i8:
i). In his other history (Wars 2:8) Josephus
says "Judas prevailed on his countrymen to revolt, and said they were cowards if they would endure to pay a tax to the Romans ; and would, after God, submit to mortal men as their
Lord"; that is, after being subject so long to
God they were cowards if they submitted to
the Romans. Josephus says the Jewish "nation
was infected with this doctrine to an incredible
degree" (Antiq. 18:1). And this sect or party
continued to exist, and waxed bolder and
stronger till he says "it was in Gessius Florus'
time" [about A. D. 65] "that the nation began to grow mad with this distemper" (Antiq. 18:
I).
5. It was then that Mena^'hem (that is,
"the Comforter") the son of Judas of Galilee,
began the war which five years later ended in
the destruction of Jerusalem (Wars 2:17). Two other sons of Judas, James and Simon,
had been crucified by order of the procurator
Tiberius Alexander, about A. D. 50 (Antiq.
20:5), but for what ofifense we are not told.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 483
Mena^'hem broke up the public armory at Mes
sada, and came back into Jerusalem in royal
pomp; became leader of the seditionary forces
which were assailing the Roman garrison of
that town; put on kingly robes, and went into the temple to worship; whereupon envy raised up Lazarus and others there; Mena'^hem fled to the suburb called Ophla, was there skulking when caught; was brought back, tortured, put to death; together with some of his prominent
followers.
6. The influence of this Judas of Galilee
must have been very considerable in his day when we observe that his teaching led to the
bloody and terrible revolt sixty years later.
But, while Josephus charges that Judas ex
horted the Jews to revolt, that his teaching
caused them to revolt, nowhere is it said that
he himself did any act of violence. In one place
he is called a "sophist," in another place "a
very cunning sophist," by the historian; by which terms we are doubtless to understand
that Jtidas was a plausible reasoner. In one
place we are told that it was "3. system of
philosophy," and twice that it was "a philoso
phic sect," that Judas founded. The fact that
Josephus opposed the revolt of his countrymen,
that he deserted their cause when its excesses



484 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
were too intolerable and atrocious, and joined
their enemies, and that his books were written
after the triumph of the latter, wdien he was a pensioner on Roman bounty, and anxious to
ingratiate himself with them, tends to show
that he has not done full justice to or stated
the better side of the doctrines of the Galilean.
A righteous resentment against one who was
the teacher of doctrines which had resulted in
the overthrow of his people and their unparal
leled miseries, might well excuse the silence or
the injustice with which Josephus treats this
man and his sect. In the narrative he gives
of his ow^n life, Josephus says he himself had
in turn been a Pharisee, Sadducee, and Essene,
and that he also dwelt from the time he was
sixteen till he was nineteen years of age in ''the desert" with one Banus, a dervish or monk, who baptised with water, and who was perhaps
a follower of John the Baptist. The sect of
Pharisees, however, w^as the one to which
Josephus at last attached himself. It may be
that Banus in some sort represented the sect
of Judas of Galilee.
7. It can hardly be doubted, indeed, that
the Jews of the first century w^ere divided into
political factions,. the extremes of which were
the Pharisees and the Galileans; the former



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 485
clinging to the pentateuchal writings, the latter
to the prophetic or apocalyptic books; the
former people being the wealthier, more con
tented, more intelligent, and stoical; the latter
the poorer, more restless, more rustic, more emotionable. The law on the one hand, upheld
in Jerusalem and perhaps all Judea; the prophets on the other hand, revered in Galilee
and the trans-Jordan, were the salient points
of division. The Isaiah, the Ezekiel, the Zech
ariah, the Malachi, the Daniel, were feeding
and inflaming the hopes of the lowly; while
the ceremonial law and its ritual continued to
satisfy the governing class : It has been shown
in this volume that this division had existed
for centuries (Jere. 7:22; 23:31; Ezek. 22:28; 23:7-8; Dan. 12:1-3). Only a stimulant was needed to develop and extend this sharp divi
sion; just as the folly of the two first Stuarts
developed a like outbreak in Britain. This
former came, about the year A. D. 6, when
Archelaus, son of the first Herod, was removed
from the petty throne of Judea, the autonomy of the nation was swept away, and that country and people became a province of Rome,
subject to direct taxation in place of tribute,
and under the supervision of military gov
ernors.



486 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
8. It was then that Judas and his sect or
party arose; not in the streets of Jerusalem,
but among the hills of Galilee. And it is cur
ious to note that, of the three sons of Judas whose names have come down to us, James and Simon bore the same names as those of
two of the brothers of Jesus, while the name of the other Me-Na^'hem; is said to mean "The Comforter" {Na-'Hem, Isaiah 40:1; 61:2;
comp. John 14: — 16:). Though Judas founded
a sect or party which existed at least up to the
time Josephus wrote the Antiquities, about A.
D. 93, it nowhere appears that Judas himself
did any miracles or that any prodigies attend
ed his birth, death or career. Indeed, Josephus
does not tell what fate befel Judas, but we learn
from The Acts (5:37) that he was slain.



CHAPTER X
ANTECEDENTS OF CHRISTIANITY
I. "God is to be Ruler" are words which,
in the mouth of ''a very cunning sophister,"
among a people ignorant of the power and re
sources of Rome, and who saw in the insignia of her authority "the abomination that maketh desolate" (Daniel 12:11), was a phrase dan
gerous to the public tranquillity. It was one easily demonstrated out of books held by
Galileans to be ancient and sacred. The Dan
iel, a book written during or soon after the
deadly struggle of the rebel people against
Antiochus Epiphanes, about B. C. 165 ; a king who had decreed the abolition of the Jewish
religion, and set up statues of his own Hellenic
gods in the temple at Jerusalem; this book, I
say, was among these inspired writings, afid
believed to be centuries older and mysteriously
prophetic. The Jews had been tributaries of the Macedonian powers around them since the
days of Alexander, B. C. 330, and their relig
ion had been tolerated by his successors till



488 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
this Antiochus, supporting a Hellenizing fac
tion (Dan. 11:30, 32), offended sentiments of
piety or patriotism ; piety and patriotism being
to the Jews much the same thing. Their fierce and sanguinary resistance to Antiochus (Dan.
12:1-3), crowned by victory, had served to in
tensify the prejudice against images and other
concrete symbols, which were called ''abomina
tions" (SJiik-A^ or -Ku-z) to Jehoah and pol
lutions of his temple. The references in the
Daniel to the conduct of Antiochus (9:27; 11
31; 12:11) in setting up ''abominations" are
coupled with hopeful intimations of the over
throw or end of these (12:), and to a blessed
period that would follow (12:12), which only
"the wise" (Ma-Sach-Il-ini) , Josephus' "cun
ning sophister," would understand or could ex
plain; the closing verse (12:13), properly
rendered, intimates that this "judgment-god" (Dani-El) will "rest" (Ta-Niu'h) till that "end" (Kez; also "awakening," 12:2) shall
come; and, as the masses of the Galileans of
the times of Judas {Jada, "wise") had fallen
into the opinion that this book was written by
one of their "prophets" three or four centuries
before the events and visions it records, its
obscurities of language when the events them
selves had become obscure were readily made



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 489
applicable, by a wise or cunning man, to the
humiliations the Roman symbols subjected them to. The Ma-Sach-Il-im here mentioned
were perhaps those who believed in the ''hidden" (Me-Shech) god, who would come, and
the Galileans of the first century were ''be
reaved" (Sech-ol) till that time should be
(Luke 2:25; John 4:25) ; and so Jesus alludes to Noa'^h (Mat. 24:37-38) as his understanding
of Nm'^h (trans, "rest," Dan. 12:13), or
Isaiah's (40:1) Na'Ji-am (trans, "comfort");
and elsewhere (John 14:16, &c.) Jesus speaks of this as the "Comforter," which the Hebrew^ word MeNa'^h-em represents.
2. It was also easy to show that the Maccabean or Has-Amon-ian triumph set forth by the Daniel was in touch with similar expres
sions and expectancies trilled in other of their
fervid lyrical Hterature; told more figuratively
and less accurately in the vein of rhapsody. In
the Isaiah, some parts of which are as late as
the going of Onias into Egypt, B. C. 175 (19:
18-21), there is an apparent declaration of the
coming reign of Jehoah (66:15-24) which was
to be attended by great violence and destruc
tive incidents because of the Shik-Kuz.* The
*Ba-Aal Piphioth (Isaiah 41:15) is rendered "teeth," but I cannot pass it over without suspicion that it is a reference



490 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Joel is almost wholly given to this concept, and the day of Jehoah is not only made awful (2:
30, 31) but ''near'' (Kerob, 1:15; 2:1; 4:14)
in the valley of "the ^Her-uz" (trans, "decision''; perhaps "Horus"). The Zephaniah (i
7, 14) is of like purport. The Zechariah (9:
3-5), written perhaps after Alexander destroyed Tyre and Azza, or even after the Mac
cabean war (9:13-16), says destructive war
fare was to precede this advent (14:), and Jehoah when successful was to reign over all
Earth (14:9). In the Malachi the divine appearance was to be attended by wars and vengeance, and Jehoah was to come suddenly
into his temple; but some later hand perhaps
added the last several verses which say that his Maleach who was to precede him was
Elijah the prophet; though the Isaiah (45:1
2) has it that Jehoah is to precede his Me-Sia'^h
C'or-Esh. Indeed, all the rhapsodic or "pro
phetic" books came to be valuable and got into
the canon for that they asserted or referred to
this manifestation of Jehoah, or his herald or
messenger, and the sequent day of their rule
or kingdom or personal administration ; so that
Cherash or C'oresh became "Cheris-t," though
to Antiochiis Epiphanes ; and the more because he laid special claims to divine honors, and hence was a Ba-Aal or false god.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 49i
in Hebrew Cheraz is rendered ''herald." A
gentle and beneficient view of this hope was
also presented, in contrast to the one of terror
and vengeance; and we find in the Isaiah (6i 1-2) that Ma-She'h of Jehoah is to ''proclaim to captives'' (Kere Shebii-im), 2iS the Greek Chaire Demeter or "Hail, Demeter!" at Eleu
Isis, and also ''comfort" (Na'Ji-eni) the poor;
a task and an office therefore (Luke 4:16-30)
assigned to Jesus. It is curious that this
famous chapter (61:) of the Isaiah, opening
with "Spirit of Adonai Jehoah is upon me Jaan Ma-She*^h Jehoah," may have suggested the name "Johan" or "John," though Jaan is rend
ered "because." There was also (Dan. 7:9,
&c.) the majestic figure of the Athik of Days, sitting when Cheras-Avan Rem-i,^ which cannot be the plural "thrones" {Cheras-in), nor
"were placed," but perhaps J-Avan ("Greece") and A-Ram ("Syria"), as some reference to
Antiochus Epiphanes, the beast burned there with fire; and thereupon came Chebar Enosh,
not "like-unto the Son of Man," but "glory
man" (comp. Chebor Jehoah, Ex. 24:16, 17), who seems to be Maccabaios (Ma-Chebor?),
* "Thrones were placed" is not satisfactory to our trans
lators, as their marginals show. Rem-i may be "Romans," as it was they who forced Epiphanes out of Egypt.



492 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
for Michael (Dan. 12:1) certainly is, yet My
gale is Greek for ''shrew-mouse," sacred to Horus or ^'Hor-us, and "mouse" is Hebrew A-Chabor, symbolized at Jerusalem (Isaiah 66:17) perhaps for Horus.
3. These hopes might well be indulged,
molded into shape, and nursed into flame by
a simple people rendered wretched by their
calamities, and embittered by the arrogance
of the ruling and wealthy class in the strong
hold and capital Jerusalem ; a class which were content to temporize with a conqueror their
intelligence taught them they could not overthrow, and who relied on and pointed to
pentateuchal law for national as well as in
dividual salvation. It was these who had allowed Pompey to go into the arcanum of the
temple (B. C. 63), who had not resisted the
Parthians when they occupied Jerusalem (B. C. 40), who had submitted to Herod the Idumean, and who were now accepting the sway of the Romans. It was mainly if not wholly
the rustics of Galilee to whom the words of
Judas, that "God is to be Ruler" when "the
abomination that maketh desolate is set up,"
had a profound significance.
4. Even at Jerusalem, in the last days of
Herod I, and not long before Judas of Galilee



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 493
arose, there had been an out-break because Herod had put a gilt eagle on the great gate
of the temple, which he had had re-built (Wars
1:33; Antiq. 17:6). Upon a rumor of the death of the aged monarch, some students were emboldened to cut down this symbol in
open day. The ''innocents,'' to the number of
forty, were seized and put to death, together
with their rabbins or teachers. The latter were Matthew of Megala and Judas of Sepphoris, or sons of Margalus and Sepphoris as
the translator of Josephus has it. They were
famous interpreters of the law, it seems, and
their school was numerously attended. They
said the eagle was a desecration of the temple,
and urged their pupils to pull it down; saying
also that, if these lost life for the deed, the soul was immortal, and they would be rewarded
with happiness after death, as well as enjoy
earthly fame. The two rabbins did not resist
arrest, and we are twice told that Matthew
was burnt alive; the only eclipse recorded by
Josephus occurring of the moon the night of the day on which he suffered, which has been
calculated as that of 13 March, B. C. 4. It is
inferable that Judas, who was delivered to be
burnt, likewise perished. The populace at
Jerusalem consented to the death of these



494 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
teachers and students. The prophets or ''div
iners/' however, said Herod's lingering and
painful death was a penalty inflicted on him
for the execution of the two rabbins. At the ensuing Passover some of the country people stood in the temple bewailing these rabbins,
insomuch that a sedition arose, repressed by
the soldiers of Archelaus, and 3,000 (Wars 2:
i) or 8,000 (Antiq. 17:9) of the people in and
about the temple were killed. These incidents
are told at some length by the careless his
torian. From the statements it must appear that this was a collision between Judeans and Galileans; a view which draws support from the name Sepphoris (Saripheus in the Anti
quities) connected with that of Judas; Sep
phoris being at the time a chief town of Galilee, about five miles from Nazareth. 5. A thought must come to the more de
liberative, in connection with this episode,
which occurred about thirty-five years before
the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth. The
tw^o rabbins are not said to have done any
miracles, or had any prodigies performed in
their behalf, except the eclipse and the disease
and death of Herod, yet a bloody sedition of
some magnitude followed fast on the event,
and this in and about the temple during the



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 495
ensuing Passover. Nor is the distinction between their teaching and the "God is to be Ruler" of Judas, or ''the kingdom of Heaven is at hand" of John and Jesus, so very appar
ent, and yet there was the opposite of a sedition
as to Jesus.
6. The fond and enticing hope that at
some future time "God is to be Ruler"; that
there is to be a better day, when Good shall
prevail over Evil ; is not only at the root of all
religions, but is the basis of human activity in every department. This expectancy is vivid
and intense in men's minds, so far as religious
concepts are concerned, in the degree that men
are wretched, and realistic in proportion to
their ignorance. To the Galileans their sacred books had promised or seemed to promise a
distinctive relief, in the form of an actual
sovereignty of Jehoah, and the over-throw of heathen power; and it only remained for
Elijah or other divine herald to come and an
nounce the arrival of the predicted period when
this should take place. It was now apparent,
from the dominance of Rome, that this period
could not long be deferred, and in order to
hasten it a preparatory stage or system of con
duct was essential. "Repent ye," cried John
and Jesus; "disengage yourselves from prac



496 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
tical concerns in order that ye may be ready for the mighty change" ; and we may Hkewise understand that the "system of philosophy"
ascribed to Judas of GaHlee meant some social deportment of the same sort. The rite of bap
tism instituted by John and followed by Jesus
signified to the outer world an acceptance of
this expectancy, and a purpose to conform to it
by a new course of conduct.
7. But the development of this ideal, this
hope, thus precipitated by the political and
social conditions which had come upon the na
tion, was necessarily reprobated by those who
were too intelligent to mistake the sacred
authors, or who interpreted them in a less
fervid sense; or by those who knew the
strength of the Roman arms, or by those who
relied on the ceremonial law and ancient faith
for national redemption. To any and all of
these, and especially to such as were in any way
connected with civic and religious functions,
the doctrines of Judas and his successors must have appeared seditious and dangerous,
as threatening the national stability; or, as
Josephus said of them after the event, they
"laid the foundation of our future miseries"
(Antiq. 18:1).



CHAPTER XI
THE CLAIMS JESUS MADE FOR HIMSELF
I. God could, of course, only be consid
ered as Ruler when active in the exercise of
the power to protect, to reward, to punish. The ''Kingdom of Heaven," when transferred to
Earth, was to be necessarily a political as well as religious government. The famous prayer
taught by Jesus not only invokes the coming
of this kingdom, but that God's will be done,
''as in Heaven, so on Earth." John and Jesus
both seem to have earnestly believed, at least
at one time, that this remarkable event would happen, and was even "at-hand" (Kerob).
Jesus declared there were those who heard him who would not taste death till they saw this kingdom come (Mat. 16:28; Mark 9:1; Luke 9:27; comp. I Cor. 11-26). And when God came, Jesus said, everyone would be rewarded according to his works (Mat. 16:27). The
change desired was therefore a political one,
as politics are the methods by which a people
are governed or ruled.
32



498 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
2. Indeed, the peculiarity of Hebrew his
tory and rehgion, and that which lends to these
some of their deep interest to those of serious
mind, is the fact that their politics and religion
were much the same thing; for Deity was al
leged to be constantly controlling or directing
their public affairs. God in human govern
ment is a marvelous conception, attractive alike
in the Iliad and the Isaiah. The intelligent
and happier Greek had, however, referred such
condition to by-gone ages; the oppressed and
meditative Jew believed that propitation would at any hour renew a relation which sin had
merely suspended. And this sin which thus in
tercepted the divine relation was considered by
the devout Judean or Galilean, and even by
many religious people of our day, as that of
others wholly, which must be removed by force
or persuasion. Theocracy is really the dream of mankind; but many Hebrews of the first century dreamed with open eyes. 3. Howbeit, as God does not deign at all
times personally to exercise sovereignty and
supervision over political institutions, there
are never wanting those who offer themselves
to act in his stead or to speak in his name.
Religious or theologic sects and schisms arise
from the fact that the claimants of this pre



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 499
rogative are numerous, and several different
ones become acceptable to several separate
portions of the masses. In a theocracy, such
as that at Jerusalem, the number of claimants
is more apt to be large, and they will conflict
with one another in proportion as the temporal
interests suffer depression.
4. The difficulty encountered by the scien
tist or student of history is, not that he
denies the existence of God, or even his gen
eral superintendence, but the scientist is un
able to comprehend that any particular person
can be selected, or which particular person, to
communicate the pleasure and will of Deity.
The broad difference in the faculties and en
dowments of men, in their conditions and op
portunities, in their temperaments and desires, which must seem arbitrary and partial, and
the effect of discrimination, would suggest that some one or more of them might possess a special heritage from a common Father ; but
even these gifts or advantages do not suffice
in the opinion of some to indicate or imply a
commission in divine or sacred things to the
one so circumstanced. The masses of man
kind, however, in every age, knowing little of
natural phenomena, and seeing little of social
mechanism, are more likely to observe the



500 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
favoritism of both society and nature, and
hence yield their suffrages or faith the more
readily to some one of the claimants. Both
classes are equally and alike sincere, as is each
individual, in these opinions, howsoever they
differ, since opinions, or ideals on which opin
ions are based, are as spontaneous as appetites,
and are less orderly, less under our control.
5. That Jesus asserted his own claim as
representative of Jehoah or of God can hardly
be questioned, though certain passages when
compared leave the student in doubt as to his
precise attitude on this important point. It must ever be borne in memory that he wrote
nothing, and that the reports we have of his
conversation and conduct were written many
years after his disappearance, probably by no one who personally heard or knew him, and
that these reports as they come to us are fre
quently interpolated. All the logia and inci
dents and events recorded in the Gospels are
most probably ''hearsay," and it is not certain
that a line of them was written in Palestine;
and we have only our translation of a Greek rendering of words of Jesus uttered in Hebrew
or Aramaic, and translations are only approxi
mations. But from these it must appear that
Jesus is represented as expressing very differ



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 501
ent concepts of his own personality; so wide
apart, indeed, that it seems the claim or con
versation of different persons. Can it be that
Jesus said at one time ''I and my father are one," and "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father," and "I came down from Heaven"
(John 10:30; 6:3s; 14:9), and that he also said he was only ''sanctified and sent," and
that he was not to be called ''good," and that he also reproached God for forsaking him?
(John 10:36; Mark 10:18; Luke 18:19; Mat. 27:46). Even one subject to elation and de
jection could scarcely express such variant
ideas of himself. And yet we are told that it
was only for his pretensions or claims that he
was put to death, and that these were considered by his countrymen to be blasphemous; and hence these claims must have been excessive to have aroused so much rancor in a land and among a people where figurative language was and is extreme, and where the term "man of God" or "son of God" was not at all uncommon ; John the Baptist himself having been
"sent from God" (John i :6). And, if it was
not for his claims that he suffered, it could
hardly have been for the riot he caused in the
temple as seeming to him still Jeremiah's (7:
II, 15) "den of robbers"; and, if we say it



502 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
was for his denunciation of Scribes and Phar
isees, we must yet account somehow for the wrath of more humble people. And yet it is
difficult to believe that he said ''He that hath
seen me has seen the Father/'
6. The title ''Son of Man" which he is
said to have applied to himself (Mat. 26:24,
64; Mark 14: 21; Luke 22:69), ^^^ i^ ^^^
sense of Daniel's Chebar Enosh, is so contra
dictory of his modest claims that we suspect
he meant the Ben Adam of the Ezekiel; the
second and third chapters of which book not
only originate this singular phrase (really
"Son or Earth"), but associate it closely with
that Issea Rua^'h (Ezek. 3:12) or upraising
spirit which developed into the third person
of the Trinity; this Je-^'Hezek-El who went to
"them of the captivity" (3:15) and found them
"impudent and stiff-hearted." The whole mis
sion of Jesus might have derived its inspiration
from these two chapters. Howbeit, it seems
doubtful that Jesus claimed to be a son of
David, from whose lineage Me-Shia*^h was
expected to come (John 7:41-42), for he was
a Galilean, which was a mixed race, and he
made the "common people" glad by proving
from Scripture that Me-Shia^'h was not to be



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 503
a son of David (Mat. 22:41-46; Mark 12:35
2yy\ Luke 20:41-44).
7. In the John Gospel (4:26; 5:18; 9:35, 2)"]^ we find that Jesus more than once claimed
distinctly that he was ''the son of God." On one occasion, however, when charged with this
assertion, he explained it away by a citation which showed that he was not claiming more
than was said of all Jews in their ancient writ
ings (John 10:33-36) In the Mark (3:11-12) he admits to the unclean spirits that he is the
Son of God, but asks them not to make the fact
or the assertion known. At the trial, while
the other two synoptics render his reply as to
this evasive or equivocal (Mat. 26:63-64;
Luke 22:70), and the John confines the an
swer to the claim of the usual title of royalty,
the Mark (14:61-62) gives the reply of Jesus that he was ''the Christ" the son of "the Blessed"; which, supposing he spoke in his
native tongue, and used the usual words, would be Bar-ha-Baruch, though Asherai (Ps. 1:1)
is a name Ehieh gives himself (Ex. 3:14). But, whatever the precise answer, the synoptics
all agree that it was in the highest degree ex
asperating to his judges and "the multitude."
This rather confirms the John (19:7) which
says Pilate was told that Jesus "made himself



504 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the son of God." "Son of God" and "Man of God" are not uncommon phrases in Jewish literature, and appHed to persons we are taught
to consider as mortals (Hosea i:io; i K. 17:
24; Luke 3:38); and Jesus' own followers seem to have had such a name among them
selves at the first (John 1:12; Rom. 8:14, 19;
Phil. 2:15; I John 3:1). It therefore seems strange that, even if Jesus answered more
positively as to this title than appears, his of
fense should have been deemed so heinous.
And, if we couple this with the fierce denuncia
tion he uses against the ruling classes as set
forth in 23d Matthew, we are still left to sur
mise as to why he had no friends to stand by
him, and was subjected to such cruel insults
from the populace ; though this surmise finds a
solution in the knowledge that these latter in
cidents are an adaptation of him by the Gospels
to the older ideals and rhapsodies, as I have
pointed out (comp. Isaiah 53:).
8. When John Baptist sent to ask of
Jesus "Are you he that should come?" there would seem to be no occasion for him to remain silent; and yet he does not then in so many
words or in substance claim the Christhood,
but merely refers to the cures performed by
him (Mat. 11 :2-5; Luke 7:18-23) ; not stating



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 505
that he was the offspring of that Mary at
whose presence John himself had leaped in his mother's womb (Luke 2:42-45); and not reminding John of that wondrous baptismal
recognition recorded in all the gospels, and
which John was familiar with (John 1:26-36;
comp. 3 : 26-36) at the time, but had evidently
forgotten or he would not have made his inquiry. Now it may well be doubted whether
healing the blind and lame, or even reviving
the dead, was satisfactory evidence or answer
to the important question, since Peter and
Paul, besides Elijah and Elisha, did these
miracles, even that of raising the dead to life, and hence could have claimed the Christhood
with equal assurance; as, indeed, all the dis
ciples, including Judas Iscariot, were given
by Jesus the power to do the like (Mat. 10:8;
comp. Luke 10:17), and were dovibtless so engaged on every favorable occasion during the remainder of their lives, though for some purpose they overlooked Stephen and James when
these saints wxre stoned, as Jesus himself
seems to have neglected John Baptist, when
that greatest born of women (Luke 7:28) was
decapitated.
9. On the event of his public entry into
Jerusalem, recorded in all the Gospels, the



5o6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
Luke (19:38) and the John (12:13) say Jesus was greeted as "king," either by the disciples
(Luke) or by the people (John), while the
Matthew (2i:g, 15) says they called him "Son
of David,'' and the Mark (11:9) merely says they cried, perhaps sang, the famous Hosan
nah (Ps. 118:26, &c.), "Blessed he that cometh
in the name of Jehoah," &c. Jesus took no offense at the adulation and recognition on
this occasion; two of the Gospels (Mat. 21 :i6;
Luke 19:39-40) saying he refused to reprove when asked to do so those who indulged in it,
though at a former time the John (6:15) de
clares he refused to be made a "king." In
further complication of his claims and conduct, it appears from the Luke that in pursuance of
this triumph, as if elated by it, Jesus at once
went to the temple and ejected its habitants, though the Matthew and the Mark say this was done the next day; and that he took possession of the building also appears (Mark 11
16); whereas in the John (2:15) we have it,
in excess of the Jeremiah (7:11-15), which
the incident imitates, that Jesus drove out the
people with a scourge composed of small cords
which violence is in singular contrast with his
gentler teachings, and with the saying that his own kingdom was not of this world (John



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 507
18:36);—the Crusades of the middle ages,
which cost a milHon hves, having their inspira
tion in this conduct, founded on the text of the Jeremiah. This pubhc entry was of course
imitative of the Zechariah (9:9), where the
M
alack (trans, ''king") goes to Jerusalem riding on a ""Hamor and on an Eair the son of
Athon-oth, which is probably an allusion to
the return of the high-priest Jehoshua from Babylon (comp. Zech. 3:1-10), for he came with Zeru-Babel (4:6-10), though Maccabeus may be the person (9:13). Two circum
stances of this event are notable; one is that
"all the city" of Jerusalem did not know who
Jesus was till the ''multitudes" who came with
him told it (Mat. 21:9-11), and the other is
that the civic authorities were highly incensed
about it (Mark 11:8; Luke 19:47), as his ar
rest quickly followed. 10. Jesus perhaps over-estimated the
plaudits he received. The effort of an \mknown Galilean to personate the Zechariah text
doubtless interested those who knew that text,
and it may be that the Galileans as a partisan
band displayed a partisan zeal in his behalf
which over-awed the simple spectators. Jesus
certainly was serious; and, if the demonstra
tion was the cause of his arrest and execution,



5o8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
this scene was the prelude to Christianity. Its
tendency certainly was to instigate his violence
in the temple, his seditious language of the 23d
of the Matthew, and the assertion of his claims
(Mat. 21:23-27; Luke 20:2-8). Yet he did not subsequently under-rate his own peril, and
was too wary to remain over-night in the
town (Luke 22:39; John 18:1-2) ; a fact which tends to show that, had he been captured during the day and in the town, there might have
been those who would have resisted this,
though the event proved otherwise as to such
disposition on the part of anyone. It may have been his seeming timidity which caused
Iskariot to betray and Peter to deny him, since
their doubts must have then generated, if the
silence of Paul and the other epistolary authors
as to Iskariot can allow us to treat him as
other than a personation of the usual attempt
at fulfillment (Zech. 11:11-14). Jesus seems
to have had the usual characteristic of an en
thusiast, that of revulsion to despondency: appearing quite unmanned if those who were
asleep at the time that night in the garden have
given a correct version of his soliloquy there.
It seems, however, that he awoke these men in
order that all should escape (Mat. 26:46;
Mark 14:42), and was captured while so en



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 509
gaged. It must also seem that Jesus was sur
prised at his arrest, and at the number of the
constabulary (Mat. 26:55; Mark 14:48-49; Luke 22:52-53), but restrained his friends present from resistance, though he apparently
contemplated resistance before he went there
by asking as to swords (Luke 22:36-38). To the constabulary he made no claim or pretension save that he had been teaching in the temple and they had come upon him as if he
was a thief.
II. When brought before Pilate and the
high-priest I have noted the wide difference of
the four gospels as to what Jesus answered as to his claims. In the Mark only did he avow that he was the Christ; an averment scarcely
consistent with the evasiveness and muteness
which the same book says (15:2-5) he returned to Pilate, which may have been because
neither understood the language of the other, unless his biographers have here practiced the
adaptation evidence (Isaiah 53:7). The two
conversations with Pilate as told in the John
are not found elsewhere, they eschew the adap
tation theory, and are counter to the synoptics
but their design seems to be that of showing
that Pilate thoroughly interrogated Jesus and
found him innocent. However this colloquy



510 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
may have gotten abroad and become imbedded in the John some seventy or eighty years later,
there is a certain naturahiess about it. If
Pilate was a cultivated man it seems very natural that he should wish to know what Jesus meant by ''the truth/' a word which many peo
ple use without stopping to consider its pur
port; but as Jesus was probably only able to use Aramaic, he must have said "ha-Amen"; that "every one who is of ha-Amen heareth"
(comp. John 17:17) ; and if Pilate did not understand Aramaic he may have caught the
word and supposed Jesus to profess faith in Jupiter-Ammon, which was at the time the best known name of Deity around the Mediterranean, and known in Canaan at least since ( Sam. 2:35) Shemu-El had been set up as an
Amen (trans, "faithful") priest and an Amen
(trans, "sure") house, who was to walk even
before Me-Shia^'h; and in Proverbs (8:30) Wisdom says he was "workman" {Anion) of Jehoah ; and so Aimmanu-El was son of Aalomah (trans, "virgin") or the feminine "Eternal."
The Luke (23:2, 5, 14) gives all the counts of
the indictment, but in that book Jesus replied
evasively or stood mute; nor did he reply to
the scoffs of those who while he was on the
cross taunted him with his claim to divine filia



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 511
tion, told in all the Gospels, but one cannot say
how far the adaptation process (Isaiah 22:8)
affects that statement. In acknowledging him
self Christ, son of the ''Blessed" (Mark 14:6162), which may have been Asherai (Ps. 1:1), we seem to have a reminder of the Egyptian custom, when after any good man died he be
came Osiri or an Osiri."^'
12. It thus seems that Jesus did not at all
times make the same claims. That he was not
condemned for ''blasphemy" alone is clear, for the Romans would not have cared or under
stood his claim to Christhood as an offense; and we can not well admit that Jesus so poorly
impressed Pilate that he gave him to be cru
cified on that charge alone, for even the sub
ordinate chief-captain rescued Paul (The Acts
2^ 126-30) at Jerusalem under somewhat like charges; and hence there cannot be a reason
able doubt that Pilate believed Jesus to be se
ditious if we consider the pains taken by Lysias
to protect Paul (The Acts 21 13 1-36) even before he had made it known that he was a Roman citizen; and so Gallio (18:12-16) did
not even wait to hear Paul's defence, and even
* The Hebrew word Asher is rendered both "happy" and "which" or "that." In the first of these meanings it appears
to me as alluding to Osiri, from whom we perhaps get the word Isra-El.



512 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
the town-clerk at Ephesus (19:37-41) quieted
the mob under Hke circumstances. The in
scription, 'Iving of the Jews/' said by the Matthew and the Mark to be the words of
Jesus's accusation, and said in the John to have
been written by Pilate, might be argued either
way, but seems to me to attest that by such
claim, or some evidence of it, Jesus was exe
cuted as a political offender. The case of Me
Na'^hem, the "Comforter" (Josephus Wars, 2:
17), so like that of Jesus as to startle us, seems
to have been settled by the Jews alone; but,
in view of the connection of Jesus with Egypt,
it would be interesting to know more about "the Egyptian"* (The Acts 21 :37-38), whom Paul was accused of being, whom he does not disavow, and who disappears in a mysterious
manner (Josephus, Antiq. 20:8). It must be remembered that we have but one, and that
* "Moreover, there came out of Egypt about this time to Jerusalem one that said he was a prophet, and advised the
common people to go along with him to the Mount of Olives,
* * * He said further that he would show them from thence
how at his command tjie walls of Jerusalem would fall down and he promised them that he would procure them an entrance into the city through those walls when they had fallen down.
Now, when Felix was informed of these things, he * * * came
against them with a great many horsemen and footmen from Jerusalem, and attacked the Egyptians and the people that
were with him. He slew four hundred of them, and took two hundred alive. But the Egyptian himself escaped out of
the fight, but did not appear any more."—Josephus, Antiq.
20:8.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 513
the favorable, side of the case of Jesus, and even in that we have it that he denounced the
Jewish authorities and was seditious in the temple, and for such conduct he would have been punished in any country at that time and even
in our day. It ought to be possible, after
these many centuries, to view a historic state
ment judicially.

CHAPTER XII
TRAITS AND OPINIONS OF JESUS
I. The personal views and traits of char
acter of Jesus, as presented in the Gospels, may
be considered in connection with what has been
said. That he has been assimilated to the
ancient concept pf all the Levantine people of a divine worker, who appears among men as
a toiler and sufferer for their betterment, and
goes away bafBed, only to return again for a
future triumph, must not cause one to overlook the statements made respecting him as a man
and a teacher of men. That the Gospel nar
ratives were written at least a generation after
his life closed, that they seem unknown to
Paul, that we do not know the names of their
authors, that their details are not substantiated by any contemporary narrative, and that these
details may be largely the arguments as it
were of fervid supporters, whose quarry for
their structure was in the Jewish Scriptures,
cannot obscure the fact that there was some
attractive person in the early part of the first



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 515
century to whom this portraiture was appHed, and to whom, later on, and even after the John Gospel was written, supposedly about A. D.
100, was applied the first two chapters of the Matthew and the Luke, and of which the Mark and the John are free; and the existence of this
person seems amply attested by Paul, who says he knew James the Lord's brother (Gal. 1 119
I Cor. 9:5), and says he saw Jesus (i Cor. 9:1) and had known him (2 Cor. 5:16), even
giving him traits of character (2 Cor. 10:1) :
though that he should afterwards have ''perse
cuted the church of God" (i Cor. 15:9; Gal. 1:13), having seen and known Jesus, would imply that Jesus made no very favorable im
pression on him, and Paul ''made havoc" of
the church till he received that revelation of
Jesus Christ (Gal. 1:12, 16) which the author
of The Acts many years later elaborated from
a visit to Arabia or Erebus into a theophany
while he was on his way, as Jonah to Nineveh
or Elishea to Damascus,''' to the latter town
(Gal. I :i7; comp. 2 Cor. 12:32-33), but which
revelation convinced Paul that by his resurrec
* No account in the Bible is more crude than this alleged
vision of Paul. That he should have had letters from the priests at Jerusalem to arrest people at Damascus, and fetch them bound to Jerusalem (The Acts 9:1-2. 14; 22:5) would scarcely be reasonable if Damascus was a suburb of Jerusalem.



5i6 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
tion Jesus was the Christ, and not that his works or words, his wondrous birth or
heavenly recognition, were evidence, for he had
not heard of these, if we judge from the four
books which are all of his undisputed writings.
2. But the Gospels seem to be from three
sources, of which the Mark and the more elab
orate Matthew are one, the Luke another, with
free use of the two first, and the John the third
and the three first took shape, much as now,
some time early in the second century, and the John somewhat later, as also The Acts ; though
there was some original of the synoptics per
haps before the fall of Jerusalem, B. C. 70, but
perhaps written abroad, and in the Greek language.
3. In their English dress, and the best
style of that language in the day of its un
adorned strength and virgin purity, we have
the discourses of Jesus, or what purports to
be such. They are, however, not more life
like than the stor}^ of Joseph or Ruth or the Odyssey, though better adapted to the serious
or religious mind. Jesus advances moral pre
cepts, not new perhaps, but illustrated by
quaint and felicitous "parables" or similes;
disclosing both closeness of observation and
fecundity of imagination ; drawn too from such



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 517
homely scenes and subjects that they must
long charm by their simplicity and real
ism. There seems to be no great reason why
they should have attached any cultivated per
son to him, and so they did not, unless we allow Nicodemus; but it is strange that he should
win to himself so few followers or believers
among an ignorant and credulous population,
wretched and agitated as they were at the time. He is not shown to have been learned, or versed
in other than Hebrew literature; he could not
read Latin (Mark 12:15-16); he said Sheba was "in the uttermost parts of the Earth"
(Mat. 12:42) ; he was not accurate as to He
brew history (Mark 2:26); he believed that physical maladies could be cured by exorcism and faith in that exorcism on the part of the patient (Luke 5:24, &c.) ; and he declared the
dervish John the Baptist the greatest of men (Luke 7:28). Yet one would say that Jesus is shown to be keen and penetrant as to social
conduct and conditions, for his controversies
disclose this. 4. He is perhaps not responsible for being
made inconsistent. If he is made to say "I
came not to judge the world, but to save the
world" (John 12 :47), why should he constantly
be adjudging the Scribes and Pharisees to be



5i8 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
''hypocrites," 'Vipers/' &c. ? since no cultivated
person would use such epithets. He is also shown to speak evil of the wealthy (Luke i8:
25), and as encouraging an idle and thriftless life (Mat. 21:31); but these sayings must be
taken in connection with the belief of Jesus or
the writer, that the Kingdom of Heaven was "at hand," and hence there would be no need
for property, no occasion for industry. So, his
indiscriminate censure of lawyers, &c. (Luke 7:30; Luke II 146), which may have led many
Christians into the great vice of intolerance, may be ascribed to the warfare he was waging against those he regarded as standing in the
way of pending national salvation. The same
may be said of his praise of the poor and the
meek, since these were the forces that were
being arrayed against those who were full of
"hypocrisy and iniquity" (Mat. 23:27), and
who were "serpents, off-springs of vipers"
( '33)- When we consider, on the other hand,
the sermon on the Mount, and other elevated
or tender sentiments of Jesus, we are disposed
to assign the fierce discourse of the 23rd of
the Matthew to the reckless John Baptist, who
denounced the Pharisees and Sadducees as
"off-springs of vipers" (Mat. 3:7), and yet
John escaped the retaliation of these people,



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 519
while Jesus did not, but even alienated some
who had once believed on him (John 8:31-40). In this connection must be noted the queer
story of Dives, whose only crime was his pros
perity, unless we add that of his tolerating the
scrofulous beggar Lazarus about his table; a
story which a certain "rich man of Arimathea,"
who buried Jesus when his faithless saints had
left him to rot on the cross, either never heard
or nobly forgot ; though this rich Joseph merely
adapts the Isaiah (53:7). Not less repugnant
to our sense of justice is the tale of that prod
igal whose worthless career and wasted oppor
tunities are, on his penitence, made the occa
sion of humiliating another son who was moral
and dutiful. A traverse lesson to these is the
parable of the thrifty and the unthrifty stew
ards (Luke 19:12-27), which may be an explanation for accepting the hospitality of the
wealthy Zacharias (19:2). 5. The deportment of Jesus, apart from
his manifest hostility to the ruling Jews, was
chaste and simple and kindly. That he was charged with gluttony and wine-bibbing (Luke
7:34) perhaps shows that it was known that
''prophets'' "wore a hairy mantle to deceive"
(Zech. 13:4) and lived on meagre fare; be
sides which it must appear that Jesus was of a



520 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
magnanimous disposition such as enables men
who possess it to adapt themselves to their surroundings. He was usually tender to women
and children, and S3'mpathetic toward the afflicted, though he would ''let the dead bury
their dead,'' and said no one could be his dis
ciple unless he hated his wife and mother and
children, &c. (Luke 14:26), which latter say
ing is a verbal expression of extreme fanati
cism, inconsistent with the general concept of him. He spoke harshly to his mother (John
2:4; 19:26; Luke 8:21), not calling her by that dear name; insomuch that one might sus
pect he had suspicious opinions of her ; yet this may be understood as having much of the
Shemitic idea of the obscure position that wom
en should occupy when outside the household. Toward Magdalene, out of whom had come seven devils, he must have exercised some con
sideration as due to a social outcast who fol
lowed him with singular devotion. But, in whatever instance he may be shown to have lacked tenderness, one might account for it by
the fact of his absorption in the mighty mission
he conceived himself to be engaged in. It may
be, too, that when embarked on his tumultuary
career he had little time to devote to those
domestic relations which soften life; of which



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 521
we get one glimpse, however, in his visit to the home of Mary and Martha. In hours of med
itation and relaxation, when not striving and
urging, he must have been amiable, for he
drew to himself the affection of women, and he must have been magnetic to his intimates, for they seem to have been devoted to him till put
to a cruel test. We must set aside the grief
he showed for Lazarus; indeed the entire in
cident must be discarded ; accepted only as sym
bolic; as an allegory of his own mission to a
sleeping people, which the John Gospel, in
which it alone is told, happily adapts from the
story of El-Ishea and Ben-Hadad, and ^'HazaEl (2 K. 8:7-15); for Lazar and El-'Hazah ( ''dream-god") are the same, and so Jesus
and El-Ishea are the "issuing" or "Hfted-up," while Ben-ha-Dad is the "Son of David," and the napkin or "wet-cloth" (Ma-Chebar) is the
"glory" of God of which Jesus speaks; just as
the daughter of Jair-us is a repetition of the
story of the son of the Shun-Ameth on whom
the same El-Ishea "stretched" (Gahar). How
beit, the contrast of the women of the Jewish
stories with those who attended Jesus is much
in favor of the latter, if we except Rizpah,
^'Hannah, and one or two others ; and all wom
anhood is ennobled bv the devotion the female



522 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
friends of Jesus showed him, when we have one who bathed his feet with her tears and dried them with her hair (Luke 7:38, 44), and another who went early to the empty sepulchre only to come back with the despairing cry "they have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid
him" (John 20:2); and this grief of Magdalene {Ma-Gadol-ah, "great-Mother") reminds one of the grief of Kyb-Ele or Magna-Mater for Athys (Gr. Atos, "year") and the search
of Athor or Isis for the body of Osiri.
6. And yet the amiable side of Jesus is
in strict accord with the gentler side of re
ligion; with the cradle of all new religions. It
is innocence and tenderness, the childlike or
feminine, docility and flowers, dimples and
down, to which the taxed and tensified human
imagination constantly recurs. Jesus as Chebar Enosh, or judge of the quick and dead,
leaves a vacancy. So does the Holy Rua'^h with its tongues of flame. These do not cool the hot temples of age and thought. Every
new religion is a protest against the austerities
and formulars of the old. These protests make
the mythic dynasties. Oros succeeds Osiris,
Jupiter succeeds Saturn, Apollo succeeds Jupi
ter, Hyacinth succeeds Apollo, &c. ; and so with



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 523
Juno or Sarah superseded by lo or Hagar. Thus Jehoah supplanted Elohim, and Jakob supplanted Esav, and Jesus supplanted Jakob or Israel. The great nature-mother has
scarcely had a better fate, since it is Ceres and
Persephone, Juno and lo, Sarah and Hagar, Naomi and Ruth, &c. The Hindus call these
changes a series of incarnations. The Latin races, who mainly compose the Church of Rome, have somewhat supplied the too mascu
line Jesus with the virginal or motherly Mary,
who in turn will some centuries hence bear the name of Lourdes or Guadaloupe, as a tenderer
phase. It is a divine procession, with its feet
toward the shade, but with eyes averted toward
the blushing dawn. 7. And what else ? The maiden with her
love-sorrow cannot go to Jesus for a confident, for he is a young man. The timid wife labor
ing in child-birth or grieving for her dead offspring must also go to the Mater Dolorosa as more in touch. The ancient Syrian or Greek,
adjudged or afflicted by his chief deity, would
turn to the wine-god Eshach-ol or Escal-Apius,
Noa'^h or Dionysus, &c., for succor, as this
deity, half-mortal, had suffered or might also
suffer. So, when our Gospel story reached the
more genial climes of Egypt and Greece, the



524 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
character of Jesus was found to be of too severe a type, and then were prefixed the two
first chapters of the Matthew and the Luke, with their sympathetic account of the mother
and her infant, old as it was in those lands of
verdure and recurrent seasons, but which has
never yet been quite assimilated to the mind
of the men of the desert, who require a deity of more sinewy arms.



CHAPTER XIII
THE HOLY GHOST
1. Jesus, the second person of the Chris
tian triad or trinity, has drawn to himself
much attention, yet httle is said of the third
person. This latter is called in English the
Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit. Christianity does
not characterise this mysterious personage as
a man, and scarcely ever as an angel; indeed,
it is one tenet of faith more unsubstantial and imaginary than any other.
2. The only animal figure we have of it is that of a dove when it descended on Jesus
at his baptism, and there it is called the Spirit
of God (Mat. 3:16), Holy Ghost (Luke 3:22), and proceeds to lead Jesus into the Wilderness. This appearance is in conformity with the
Isaiah (11:2), where it is said "And the
Na'^h-ah upon him a Rua'^h of Jehoah," &c. and so (Num. 11:25) Jehoah came dow^n and took of the Rua^h that was upon him and put it on the elders, whereupon they prophesied
when "Noa'^h upon them the Rua^'h.'' There



526 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
seems some connection of these several texts with the Flood-hero Noa^'h and his "dove" or
Jonah. In Egyptian hieroglyphics the dove or pigeon is Ne^'h, and the pigeon was Kal-em-Pe'^ or "bird-of-Heaven," while Ne'^h means "entreat," "pray," and a pigeon was thrown to each of the four quarters when a new king was
proclaimed; which last custom, as well as the word Na'^h, accounts for the dove as a symbol
of the Rua'^h at the baptism ; Na'^h or Noa'^h in
Hebrew meaning "rest," "comfort," but possibly connecting with the Egyptian word and
symbol, as the "Comforter" connects with the Holy Rua^h.
3. Rua^'h in Hebrew is variably rendered
"spirit," "wind," "breath," and in Phoenicia
Rua'^h was a name of Deity, or personification
of Deity, having the same general meaning as in Hebrew. In Egyptian the word Re^h means "wise," "knowledge," and the Re'^h-^Het were
the "counsellors" or magi at the court; hence
probably Pa-Raklet-os or "the Comforter" is
made by prefixing the definite article, and is
from the Egyptian tongue as "the Counsellor."
It seems likely that this word Re^h gave us
* Kal-em-Pe must be the Latin word Col-um-Ba, a name
applied to the dove and pigeon. Colombo, who was the first
European that arrived in the West Indies, had a name of this meaning.



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 527
the Latin word Rex and the Greek Arch-on; perhaps Rosh in the Hebrew. The title AbRech, apphed to Joseph (Gen. 41 143), may be
Ap or ''judge" and Re^'h or "wise."
4. In the story of the Creation the Rua4i
Elohim is said to Ma-Ra'^h a Peth in the face of the waters (Gen. 1:2) when darkness was on the face of the Tehom, whereupon Elohim
called for or made light, for Earth was Tohu and Bohu; which description seems copied from the Jeremiah (4:23), where it seems (v.
11) a fiery Rua^'h is to come from the wilder
ness to cause this desolation. Ma-Ra^'h means
to "rub" or ''soften," in Arabic it means to
"anoint," and Peth is a "hole" or "fissure";
hence it would seem that the Rua'^h softened the "deep" or Tehom till an opening was made in it from which light was emitted. Ma-Ra^^h
is used here to express the function of the
Rua^'h, it must seem, for it is the same word,
and if we read Ma-Ra'^h as "breathed" on the Tehom or inert mass we may understand that
this breath of Elohim, called Rua'^h, set it in
motion or activity. In the John Gospel (20:
21-22) Jesus is made to assume the chief char
acteristic of the Rua'^h when he tells his dis
ciples "As the Father has sent me, so send I
you," and breathes on them, thus setting them.



528 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
to work or in motion. So, the mighty wind
at Pentecost, parting into tongues of fire, sat
on each of the assembly, giving them power
to speak in several languages. These and
other texts show that the Rua^^h Elohim was
in accord with much of the ancient belief that
the wind was the breath of Deity. In the Eze
kiel (37:1-14), where our interpretations make
the Rua^h ^'spirit," ^'breath,'' "wind" in the
same passages, it might seem that, if these were the author's meanings, he was toying with
the several uses of the word. 5. The Chaldean account of the combat of Marduk and Tiam-at has been suggested by
Delisch Jr. and others as the original of the
Hebrew account of the Creation, and it seems
certain that Tiam-at is Tehom or the "deep/'
and the Greek translators of Berosus under
stood. Tiam-at to mean the sea; but the Chal
dean narrative makes her the mother of Chaos.
Marduk seems certainly the personification of
light and order, and F. Lenormant says his name is from the Akkadian words Amar
Atuki or "Sun-brilliance,'' which as light would
leave to Tiam-at or Tehom the character of
darkness or night, perhaps cold or winter.
Marduk attacks her; his chief weapons being
the Shar-i or "winds," w^hich penetrate her Pa



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 529
or "mouth" and enter her Kerash or ''abyss."
The "bad" wind, as it is rendered, is Ma-'^HuU
ah, which in Hebrew is rendered usually "sickness," but also "round," hence "whirl" or "Whirl"-wind, which would connect Shar with
Seair-ah, which carried off Eli-Jahu, and was
suspected of being a Rua'^h of Jehoah (2 K.
2:16), and was both a mighty Rua^'h and
Seaar-ah in the case of Jonah (1:4). In the Egyptian story of the combat of ''Heru with
Set the victor as the winged globe pursues Set but the Egyptians depicted the winds as winged and with the head of a ram.
6. In the Ezekiel (37:5, 10) it appears
that the dry bones would live if the Rua'^h was
put into them, but this was figurative of the
Rua'^h of Jehoah (v. i) which was to restore
the house of Iserael, for w^hen Jehoah Elohim made Adam the words "breathed" and "breath"
are Pa^'h and Neshem. This Jahvist writer
seems to treat the Rua'^h as merely "wind," for it is he who says that Jehoah Elohim was going
in the garden in the Rua'^h of the "day" or
Jom, and yet as the pair hid themselves at
hearing his Kol or "voice," "noise," we might
read Rua'^h as a hot wind rather than "cool."
The regular Jahvist seems to say that, owing
to their iniquity, Jehoah declared "My Rua'^h
34



530 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
shall not remain in the man always; he flesh; and he shall have his days a hundred and twenty years"; which implies that mankind
were immortal before that time by the fact
that Jehoah's breath or spirit was in him or on Earth; and "s. Rua'^h of animals" seems to
have been in all flesh (Gen. 6:3, 17), for ''Ha-im
seems to me "animals," not ''living." These
texts lead one to the conclusion that Rua'^h
means generally breath, respiration, wind, as
a condition of life, not a personification. The
breathing of Jesus on his followers was an
unction or sanctification, but endowing them
with divine power and authority.
7. More different still are other texts.
The (not "a") Rua'^h stood amid the host of
Jehoah (i K. 22:21), who suggested a treach
erous mission, and the Rua^'h offered to exe
cute it by putting a Rua'^h liar in the mouth of
all A'^he-Ab's prophets; which incident shows
that the Rua^'h was a distinct personage, and
different from the menials or Zebe of Heaven
and of Jehoah; entirely separate from Jehoah
himself, yet his agent. But this personage is "the Rua^h," and the Rua^h "liar" or Sheker
he put into the mouths of others must be rath
er a breath or utterance, an inspiration or
respiration, so that the Rua'^h or "Spirit" of



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 531
Jehoah, whom the EngHsh versions call holy
Ghost, is not the same as the Rua^'h, ''spirit,"
''breath," which is in mankind or that which
is imparted to pious Christians. It will not do
to say that this scene in Heaven was a mere vision of Micha-Jahu, since we have much the
same scene in the Job, where the Satan ap
pears among the sons of the God before Jehoah,
and is authorised by him to afflict and ruin the most perfect man on Earth. These two instances are to be remembered when we read 2 Sam. 24:1 and i Chron. 21:1, where in the
one narrative it is said "Again the Ap (or Ap'')
of Jehoah was ''Har-oth in Israel, and he laSat David," &c. ; whereas in the corresponding
account of the Chronicler it is said ''Stood Sa
tan above Israel and la-Set David," &c. ; this
Ap or Ap^, rendered "anger," being properly
a "breathing-place," the "nose," and expresses
the hard breathing of an angry person, Gesen
ius states; hence is quite near Rua'^h or
"breath"; but the pious Chronicler converts
the Ap of Jehoah into Satan, that is, Jehoah's
angry breath when ''Har-oth or "kindled,"
"burning," "wax-hot" (Ex. 22:24, &c.); the 'Heru or "burned" of the Isaiah (24:6) being the Egyptian word Anglicized as "Horus," and thus seeming to identify the wrathful Jehoah
35



532 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
with the victor over Set, whose name probably
appears in the la-Set or "moved," properly "in
cited," "seduced," as Ai-Zebel "stirred-up"
A^he-Ab to follow after Gillul-im or "ghouls"
( I K. 21 :25-26). But the Rua'h sent to A'he
Ab, and the Satan sent to Job, were personal
ities that could talk to Jehoah, and not a blast
from his nostrils or a hot breath from his
mouth; courtiers and counsellors of Jehoah,
whose artful intellects were malevolent; and
malevolent they remain when the one leads
Jesus to the other to be tempted. Yet it is the
Rua'^h and not the holy Rua'^h which thus conspires with Satan (Mat. 4:1; Luke 4:1),
though this is not clear (comp. Mat. 3:16);
and even if it was the holy Rua'^h its conduct
in co-operating with Satan to tempt Jesus
w^ould seem far less vicious than the permit
given by Jehoah to Satan to afflict Job, or the
suggestion of Jehoah that "the Spirit" should
seduce A'^he-Ab to a bloody death, or that the
Ap ""Har-oth or "breath hot" of Jehoah should
seduce David to number Israel in order that
a pestilence should desolate the land.
8. In connection with this "hot breath"
of Jehoah, which seems another name for the
Rua'^h or "Spirit" of Jehoah, called Satan by
the Chronicler, must be mentioned the Chal



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 533
dean tablets, translated by the learned George Smith, where the gods Anu and Ea send Dib
barra the god of pestilence to punish mankind and this Deber (2 Sam. 24:15) was sent by Jehoah into Israel, and slew 70,000 people. The word Deber and its forms is mostly used
for "to speak,'' "word," "command," "oracle," and so, as somewhat that issues from the
mouth, may thus connect with Rua'h as breath or spirit, and the Dibbarra of Chaldea may
express the hot breath of fever or of anger which in the Hebrew story follows the Ap
''Har-oth of Jehoah. 9. The statement that the Rua^h of Je
hoah "came-mightily" or Zela^i upon Shimesh
on, Sha-Aul, and other Gibbors, means that it "prospered" them, not "came-mightily," though
the word is close to Zel or "shade," and may mean that the Rua'h invisibly attended them.
In the case of Sha-Aul, the Rua'h of Jehoah left him after it came upon David, and an evil
Rua'^h from Jehoah troubled Sha-Aul till Jehoah's favorite David charmed it away with music, as no other person could have done, it must seem. It thus again appears that there
are evil spirits at the command of Jehoah,
whom he sends out to trouble people he dislikes. The evil dream sent by Zeus to Agamemnon



534 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
was perhaps of kindred species, and so the Eumenides or Furies to whom the Greeks paid
divine honors; but the Greek idea so strongly
personified in the Furies, seems more as if from the seven Hathors of Egypt, of which we have some ghmpse. The Furies were consid
ered agents of Deity to inflict punishment in
this hfe and in Hades. They drove Orestes to
tits of madness, as the Rua^'h of Elohim did
Sha-Aul,"^ but Orestes was pardoned by
Apollo. Sha-Aul's evil Rua'^h came more than
once (i Sam. i8:io; 19:9), was Zela^'h in one of these, which was probably the reason why
the hand of David failed this time to appease
him ; but the statement that a Rua'^h of Elohim
had left him seems to have laid him open to an
evil Rua'^h of Elohim ; hence we may infer that
one who has the Rua'^h of Elohim is free from
its evil brother; in fact is turned to a man
A-'^Har (10:6), perhaps ''Heru or ''Horus,"
as all the kings of Egypt had ""Heru names;
"for the Elohim with thee" (v. 7).
9. And ''prophesy" is one of the faculties
or endowments which resulted from having the
Rua^'h (v. 7; also 19:23-24; Num. 11:25). -^
* Matricide was the crime of Orestes; that of Sha-Aul was a partial disobedience of a hideous command of Jehovah (1 Sam. 15:3, etc.).



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 535
Xebie or "prophet" was one who could foreteU
the future or reveal the unknown, and to which
pretensions was added often contortions and
ravings like those of the Sibyl (i Sam. i8:io).
The disciples seemed to have understood the
old custom when the Holy Ghost came as a
wind at Pentecost. This effect gives us the
dogma of inspiration, applied to all the writers
of the canonical books, and w^hich seems lit
erally to mean that the person inspired has in
breathed the breath of Deity; hence in turn
can impart the Divine afflatus, or breathe on a
writing so as to make it the word of Deity
(from Ad Flare, "to blow") ; as at the first a
Rua^h of Elohim Ma-Ra'^h a Peth or "hole"
upon the face of the waters (Gen. 1:2); that
is, "softened," "rubbed,"* an opening in the
watery Tehom or "deep," "Chaos," thus ani
mating it for divine purposes. The Nebie was
thus a "man of Elohim," as frequently said,
and could even restore animation by putting
his mouth to the mouth of the dead (2 K. 4 134) Likewise wxre their utterances which came
forth with his breath, as this was the Divine
breath; therefore familiar with divine fore

knowledge, the Greek Pro-Phanai or "to speak before." The word Nebie seems to have no
such meaning, but is supposed to come from
the word Nebaa, to ''boil forth" ; yet it is more
probable that the word Naba'^h, to ''bark" as a
dog or wolf, is to be associated with the word,
for it seems sure to me that the worship of
"A-Nub-is," as the Greeks called Anup the
wolf-head angel of the tomb, had its focus in
Syria at ""Heberon, Noba^'h, Kenath, &c., and
this is shown by Chaleb the son of ie-Pun-eh,
reverse of ha Nup-ei, as Chaleb is "dog" and
was a Keniz or "hunter"; and so Noba^'h took
Ken-ath (Num. 32:42), wherefore the Greek word Kuon or Kyu-os and the Latin word Canis; and the worship of Chaleb or Anup,
otherwise Naba^'h or the "barker," may have
given us Nebie as a priest of A-Nup-is, who in
primitive times perhaps imitated the bark of a
dog or howl of a wolf in their frenzy or incan
tations, that is raving or "prophesying." The
dog in Egypt was generally very sacred, and
Horapollo says it represented a scribe, a
prophet, &c., but, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson
says, this was probably the dog-head ape, sym
bol of Thoth and of letters; yet the "wolf" or
Unesh and the "fox" or Sabu (the Hebrew



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 537
Zeeb and Shuaal*) were also locally sacred, being symbolic of Anup, and seem connected with embalming and the tomb. But Neb in Egyptian means ''lord," or is so rendered, and
it is probable that Nebie is from that word, as
indicating superiority, though I prefer to sup
pose the dervish wrapped in a wolf-skin was
called a Nebie because attached to the cultus
of ''Anub-is" or Chaleb; nor is it to be over
looked that King Sha-Aul the first Meshia'^h,
who goes to the land of Sha-Aal-im or "jack
als" (i Sam. 9:4), who dwelt much in caves, and whose name is nearly exact with She-Aol or the "grave" and Hades, was in some degree a phase of Anup, and hence w^as among the Nebie (i Sam. 10:11; 19:24). And a name of Anup, Mr. Budge says, was Governor of
Se'^het or "hall-of-God," whence perhaps the
Hebrew "destruction" or She'^h-ith (Ps. 16:10,
&c. ; comp. She-Aol, Num. 16:30, ^^^ &^-> with
going down to Sha'^h-ath, Job. 33:24; Ps. 30:9,
&c.), which as "pit" is the same as She-Aol.
It is certain that religion largely rests on the
professed knowledge of the future abodes of
the soul claimed by the priests in all ages, and,
W'hile very little is said of this in Hebrew writ

538 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
ings (Isaiah 14:9), even to a late period the
Nebie was said to have the Rua'^h of Elohim in
him (Dan. 4:8, 9; 5:14). 10. In the instances of the actual pres
ence of Jehoah we find that he is not usually
attended by a Rua^'h as a personage. Jehoah
tells David (2 Sam. 5 124) that he must bestir himself to battle when he hears the Kol march
ing in the tops of the mulberries, or the Kol of
marching, which implies a Rua4i, and of course
that of Jehoah. At ''Horeb, after the Maleach
of Jehoah had ordered Eli-Jahu to eat, a Debar of Jehoah came to him, questioned him, and
told him to stand before Jehoah in the mountain; and Jehoah passed over, accompanied by a great and strong Rua'^h, which broke moim
tains and rent rocks before Jehoah, [and] not
in the Rua^'h Jehoah; and after the Rua'^h an
earthquake, then a fire, but Jehoah was not in them ; and after the fire a Kol Demem-ah Dak
ah which caused him to hide his face in his
mantle and stand at the mouth of the cave,
"and behold to him a Kol," and said ''Why to
thy mouth Eli-Jahu?'' just as the Debar had
asked, meaning perhaps for him to speak, or perhaps meaning to ask if as in v. 18 his ''mouth" or Pah had kissed Ba-Aal. But this
Kol or "voice" seems that of Jehoah (v. 15),



EGYPT AxND ISRAEL 539
who now gives orders of a bloodthirsty nature
(v. 17). I have in this volume called atten
tion to this Kol Demam-ah as connecting with the Kol Demei of Kain, "crying to me from the Adam-ah" (Gen. 4:10), which has opened
its Piah to take the Demei of his brother, and with the A-Kel Dam-ah of Iskariot, which seems a "voice of blood," and which we may understand perhaps at least as an ac
cusing conscience, and in the sense of the
classic Furies ; for Eli-Jahu had butchered 450
priests at C^'armel. We have here the Debar
or "word" and the Kol or "voice" as appar
ently dividual entities, according with the
"pestilence" angel Dibarra (2 Sam. 24:15)
of the Chaldeans, and with the Kol Pia^'h or
"voice breath" (comp. i-Pa'^h or "breathed,"
Gen. 2\y^ of Phoenician myth-lore, whose wife
was Bahu (comp. Gen. 1:2) according to
Sanchoniathon,'*'' and who is evidently the same
as Rua'^h. And we have in this dramatic theophany the Rua^'h rending the mountain and
breaking the rocks of ''Horeb before or in front
of Jehoah, and but for the "earthquake" and
the "fire," Ra-Aash and Esh, it would cer
tainly seem that this Rua'^h was a personality,
* Sanchoniathon says their children were ^Hav-ath and
Adam Kademun.



540 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
yet Ra-Aash is not always "earthquake," and maybe ''thunder/' "tumuh" while in Chaldaic myth-lore Ishu was the fever demon, companion of Debarra; still, when we note the
dividuality of Rua^h in the previous chapter
(i K. 18:12; and so 2 K. 2:16; Ezek. 3:14),
we may suspect the gigantic bird Rukh of Arab
fable to be an issue of this Rua^'h concept.
II. Jehoah is also attended by his Chebor
or ''glory,'' rides on a Cherub (the two words
have the same letters), and speaks out of a Seair-ah or "whirl-wind;" but he carried Beni
Isera-El on wings of "eagles" (Ex. 19:4) or
Neshar-im, which is possibly the Shar-i or
"winds" of the Chaldaic Marduk in his com
bat with Tiam-at. In the vision of ''Hezeki-El
the likeness of the Chebod or "glory" (the Egyptian ^Haibit or "shadow") of Jehoah (Ezek. 2:28) and winged ""Hai-oth came in a Rua'^h Seaar-ah (Ezek. 1:4) from the Zephon, w^ith a great cloud and an Esh; out of which
Esh or "fire" came these four ''Hai-oth or
"beasts" (feminine), which went wherever the
Rua^'h went (vs. 12, 20), and were perhaps
the genii of the four cardinal points, or their
winds. "And came in me a Rua'^h which spake
to me, and set me on my feet," &c. (2:2), so
that it was a Rua'^h that spoke and uplifted



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 541
''Hezeki-El (3:12), sending him to the captives
with the ''Thus saith Adonai Jehoah" (2:4); and this instruction was attended by a Kol of
a great Ra-Aash/' Blessed Chebod of Jehoah" (3:12); Ra-Ash being EH-Jahu's ''earthquake"; but as "rushing'' we may see
how the author of The Acts (2 12-3 ; also 4 131 found his phenomena. That it was the Rua4i
that entered into ""Hezeki-El, and spoke to him,
appears again and again (Ezek. 4:24; 8:3, 5; 11:1-2, &c.); giving him strength and voice,
not alone to take messages to Iserael, but to talk with Jehoah, whose Chebod was often at hand. 12. This Chebod of Jehoah was bright, and is compared to the rainbow (1:27-28),
while the Egyptian ^Haibit was the shadow of
a person after death, and very much the same
as the popular concept of a ghost in modern
sense. The rainbow was the classic Ir-is,
messenger of the gods, especially of Hera; the name perhaps coming from Syria and Ethi
opia as Air or "watcher," as in the later He
brew (Dan. 4:13, 17, 2Tf), where it is called a holy-one from Heaven, but is masculine. The Chabod of Jehoah would doubtless be a daz
zling apparition, like or the same as the She
chin-ah when Deitv is in his Shechan or



542 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
"dwelling," which Chabod was like a bright
cloud (i K. 8:ii), though in the next verse
(12) Jehoah is said to Shechan in ''thick-dark
ness" or Aaraphel. The Chabod is a more
lofty concept than the real presence of God in the wafer at the Roman Church communion,
but seems in the Daniel (i :26-27) to have the appearance of a man, which brings it more in
harmony with the -^Haibit or ''shadow."
13. There is some connection between the
Rua'^h or "Ghost" and the Shed-im or "daemons" who were worshipped by the Jews, and who "came up from the Kibor" or "grave,"
not "of late" (Deut. 32:17; also Ps. 106:37). F. Lenormant says Shed-im was the Chaldean word for genii, but if they were from the tombs
it is more likely they were what we call ghosts
or spirits of the dead ; and children were sacri
ficed to them, as the Romans sacrificed their
children to Penates or household gods, perhaps ancestors. The word Shed, Shud, or Shedad,
means "lord," "powerful," "to do violence,"
"destructive," and from it comes El Shadda-i, rendered "God Almighty"; properly perhaps God of Shada-i or Shed-im, who were evi
dently powerful and destructive, and from the tombs; hence "daemons" or "devils" or "genii"
might well be a correct rendition in later times



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 543
of the once good beings who were subordinates of the chief El. In Phoenician mythology
Shadid was son of El or II, who slew this son
so Sisera ''fell down Shadud" (Judges 5:27), perhaps ''destroyed." But this story from
Sanchoniathon, relating to the theogony of
Byblos, seems to connect this divine son with
the city A-Shedod in Philistia, where, as a
phase of Adonis, he was probably worshipped. The Deuteronomy is said by DeWette and most scholars to have been written in the time
of Josiah, and Psalm 106 is later than the
Captivity of Babylon (v. 46) ; so that these Shed-im were not of very remote date as ob
jects of worship, or as recipients of the blood
of children (Ps. 106:37). 14. The phrase "gave up the ghost" oc
curs several times, and the word "ghost" is Gevaa; but this word is perhaps the same as
Gev-ah and Gevi-ath, "body," "corpse," and the
rendering should probably be "gave up the body" ; and yet the word is simply i-Gevaa, and
"give up" is gratuitous. The reading is "And
i-Gevaa and died Abraham," &c., while the Gevi-ath of Sha-Aul was fastened to the wall of Beith-Shan (Guph-ath in i Chron. 10:12) ; hence the reading should accord with the
definition of Gesenius, "And breathed-out and



544 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
died Abraham/' &c., so that ''gave up the
ghost" is more true than fehcitous if ghost and
breath are the same.
15. The Isaiah, it is seen, had separated Jehoah and his Ruach or the Ruach (48:16).
In the sacred songs, too, there was a separation
of the two by its being ''sent forth" (Ps. 104:
30), and a distinction was made between the "presence" of Jehoah and that of his spirit
(139: 7); while at times Jehoah rides on the wings of Ruach (Ps. 18: 10), where it seems the same as the Cher-Ub, though in the same
song ( : 15) it appears as his "breath." As the majesty and dignity of Deity were appre
hended by one writer more than another; by
the rhapsodist more than the historian ; it must have appeared that a somewhat general deity
could not or would not confer special favors
on special persons, or talk with them as he was said to have done with Adam, Mosheh Aaron, Miriam, Balaam, Shelomeh, and others, "as
a man speaketh with his friend" (Ex. 33: 11).
The higher concepts of him required that he should operate through an agent or medium,
as earthly potentates must often do. And
Jesus, while he seems to take at time the strongest view of his own relation as such
agent or medium, also, as we have seen, defined



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 545
the function of the Holy Spirit; his idea being
that this was the evidence of God in action, in
beneficent action, whom it was an unpardon
able sin to resist (Mat. 12: 28-32; Mark 3: 28
29; Luke 12: 10); a celebrated saying which
has done more to establish the third person
of the Trinity as a dividuality than all else.
And this saying was uttered, according to the Matthew and the Mark, on an occasion when
Jesus was healing diseased persons, ''casting out devils," and when his method of exorcism
or cure was alleged by his then attending crit
ics to be that of one who himself had ''an un
clean spirit" (Mark 3: 30). Scarcely less
weight has had the remark of Jesus in the John (3: 38) where the rejuvenating power
of this activity is made essential to salvation.
Paul elaborates the concept in the 12th chapter
of I Corinthians, but it is to Jesus we owe its
apotheosis. "God is Spirit," he said (John 4:
24). From some passages it would seem that
Jesus taught that mere belief in the coming
of God's reign would not save or bring the
happy day, but that activity in benevolence
was indispensable; and the animation ex
pressed by breathing, by winds, sighs, groans,
by birth-throes, by healing, by the exercise of
"power," by works, pouring, &:c., were the



546 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
typifications, manifestations, necessary to at
test Divinity in that evil day. But it may be
questioned whether the Holy Spirit idea ad
vanced by Jesus is precisely what we now gen
erally understand by it ; since it was not to him
the spiritual, the meditative, the dreamy, the
dainty, the receptive, but the opposite of these
the aggressive, operative, helpful, practical; which w^as able to make one know good from
evil, and enable one to stand by the good or God. As Ezra had dethroned El-Berith, ElZabaoth, and El-Shaddai, and set up Jehoah, so
Jesus associated the now inactive Jehoah with
a deity of good works ; and this is an evolution
which is ever going on, as Jesus has to Pro
tentants superceded his father, as Mary does
the like functions in the ideas of Catholics.
This was largely the revolution in religion
wrought by or in the name of Jesus, and w^hich
gives to Christianity its force as a factor in humanics.
1 6. Indeed, in some degree, Jesus has been
by many classified with this type of deity; as
a personification of it. In one instance, at an
early day, it is called the Spirit of Jesus (The
Acts i6: 7). In other parts of the New Testa
ment the concept seems to supercede other con
cepts of God (The Acts 15: 28; 16: 6; 28: 25;



EGYPT AND ISRAEL 547
II : 12; 7: 51 ; 1 : 16; Mat. i: 18). Paul makes
the Spirit an intercessor with God (Rom. 8:
26). A more general concept in that day,
however, as perhaps in this, and as to Jesus,
was that it was the "power," that is the activity or Urgos, of God (Luke 24:49; The Acts i: 8), working, healing, curing, comforting. And
it could be conferred on or imparted to others
by the disciples, not by the ceremony of breath
ing on them, but by that of laying on of hands
(Acts 8: 17-19); yet what precisely was the
visible effect it had as an initiatory rite which
caused Simon to desire to buy the function
does not appear as Phillip was already there
doing great miracles without exercising it or
conferring it on others. 17. The formula ''Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost," so far as its use by Jesus is concerned,
is found only in the Matthew (28: 19) ; a conversation and an appearance of Jesus which no
other writer records; and the authenticity of
which is challenged if Jesus did not meet the
disciples in Galilee after the crucifixion (Luke
24:49; Acts 1:4). His last words in the other gospels and in The Acts do not sustain the formula, which may have been written at a later time than other parts of the Matthew
(28: 15). It may be suggested, in this con



548 EGYPT AND ISRAEL
nection, , as the Matthew and Mark in their
original form are generally believed to have been composed about the year A. D. 65, at which time Mena^'hem ("Comforter") assumed
the purple and headed the great Galilean re
volt against Rome (Jos. ''Wars," 2: 17), that
some relation exists between these two Gospels
and this son of Judas the Galilean; the more
as Jesus is left alive in Galilee by the closing
verses of the Matthew, with a promise on his
part that he would be with his friends to the
end of the world, then at hand (Mat. 24: 34;
Mark 13:30; Luke 21:32), and he had already promised to go to Galilee after he was raised up (Mat. 26:32; Mark 14:28); but to believe that Jesus and Mena^'hem were the same person we must also believe that Paul
wrote subsequently to the overthrow of Jeru
salem, which can in no wise be admitted.
