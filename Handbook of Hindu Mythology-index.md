Writing the Handbook of Hindu Mythology proved to be a project that
rounded out three decades of work as a historian of religion special
izing in religion in India. I had sought out a colleague in India to fill
in any gaps I might have in the nearly five thousand-year span of Hindu mythol
ogy, but in the end I needed to fill those gaps with new study and translations of
materials I had previously ignored. Hindu mythology was once something I had
looked down upon with an intellectual contempt that partial ignorance blesses.
But now I look back with a bemused smile and hear the laughter of Hindu gods
and goddesses at so rash a conceit. Just like the many reversals in Hindu myths,
my colleague’s withdrawal from the project allowed me to enter a magical land
scape of complexity, reversals, and ambiguities that the more rational ap
proaches of philosophy, theology, and history do not allow.
It is difficult to give up scholarly trappings. I have spent the last seven years
preserving Sanskrit manuscripts, digitizing some myself and training archivists
and librarians all over India to utilize these new tools. To be called a pioneer in
anything leads to a little pride, but Indian culture humbles any Western scholar.
To be invited twice to the Sir Ashutosh Mukerjee Chair as a visiting professor at
the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore was a great honor,
allowing access to some of the oldest surviving sacred texts. But the real fruit of
comparative textual studies lies in the future when scholars will have an abun
dance of versions of the same text and will be freed by a notion of an inclusive
text that encompasses all its versions. That all versions of a myth are necessary
for a complete understanding of its richness can only be hinted at in a book of
this size, but versions of each myth are selected to be representative of the vari
ations over time and among even contemporary accounts.
For the Handbook there will be no attempt to surprise the reader with new
interpretations. Rather, the intention of this study is to engage anyone interested
in Hindu mythology in its variety, its richness, its reversals, and its play (l ̄ıl ̄a). As
a handbook for the general reader, a number of decisions have been made about
the transliteration of Sanskrit, the sacred language of India, that will aid in better
xvii
PREFACE



readability, pronunciation, and use in moving through the literature on a given
topic. The Sanskritist will have no problem knowing a technical term when I
use a more popular Romanization of a Hindu term or the name of a god or god
dess. Conversely, it is the general reader who suffers when we use the most accu
rate transliteration of Sanskrit. I will use as few diacritics as possible to help the
general reader in identifying precisely in Roman letters the term or name in
question, but will resist making these spellings too foreboding. Consequently, I
will use an s ́ for one of the three “s” consonants in Sanskrit, as in S ́iva. It is too
often spelled “Siva,” which gives no help in pronunciation, or “Shiva,” which
helps in pronunciation but does not alert the beginner to the study of Sanskrit
and hides the complexity of the multiple ways of spelling the name of this deity.
Long vowels will be marked to help in pronunciation. Sanskrit vowels are pro
nounced much like Spanish or Latin vowels except for the short “a,” which is
pronounced as a short “u” (but). Aspirated consonants (such as “bh” or “dh”) are
best learned in oral practice from a teacher. “C” is pronounced as “ch” in
“check” but there is also an aspirated “ch” that doubles the aspiration. The
beginner should be alert to the fact that a word like âcârya might also be translit
erated as “acharya” by some.
An old rule of thumb in a beginning Sanskrit class to try to learn the rhythm
or cadence of the language is to give a consonant one count, a short vowel two
counts, and a long vowel three counts. Thus, diacritics will be used for long vow
els to help the general reader’s pronunciation and to avoid some hidden pitfalls.
Thus, “brâhmin” (priest) is pronounced with the first syllable twice as long as
the second. And the use of brâhmin for priest instead of brâhmana, or its often
shortened version, brâhman, chooses a later spelling rather than its more
ancient form so that the reader will not confuse brâhmin with Brahman, the
Absolute. Both words for priest, brâhmin and brâhman, have a long vowel in the
first syllable and omitting the diacritical mark leaves one with no distinction in
the written word between a priest and the Absolute—a confusion that priests
have not minded, but one that needs to be avoided nonetheless.
This text will follow the academic custom of not capitalizing the words god
and demon. This can be justified from most Hindu perspectives as well, since
the Absolute, the Supreme Being, is not being referred to as a whole. When the
Absolute, or the entirety of the Godhead, is indicated, then God will be capital
ized. There is no theological truth intended, even though almost all capitaliza
tion has disappeared from current English prose. This choice will not seem
scholarly enough for some and may seem too Western for others. Hopefully, the
reader should accept this practice for its face value as a modern attempt to avoid
too much capitalization while respecting a tradition.
The “n” used for neuter endings will be not used in instances where another

term is more common in English. Such words as karma and dharma will be used
instead of the older neuter forms karman and dharman. Karma and dharma will
be italicized when they are concepts but when they are personified as devas
(gods), such as Dharma, they will be capitalized and not italicized.
Another aspect of transliterating Sanskrit involves the lack of spaces
between words. Thus, any use of spaces is a concession to other languages used
in its transliteration. The same can be said concerning hyphenation. Since a
medium-sized Sanskrit word can easily reach twenty letters, the general reader
may have great difficulty recognizing elements that can easily be learned, so
either spacing or hyphenation is quite useful. Mahâs ́iva or S ́ivadeva are only
eight-letter words but they are instantly recognizable as Mahâ-s ́iva or S ́iva-deva.
The use of Mahâ (great) before a name—Mahâ-Lakshmî or Mahâlakshmî, Mahâ
Devî or Mahâdevî, Mahâvishnu or Mahâ-Vishnu—demonstrates variant forms of
names. I will use these variants interchangeably to both teach the reader to rec
ognize elements that can be learned easily and to aid in the use of reference
words and databases that employ alternate systems of spelling, spacing, capital
ization, and hyphenation.
Capitalization is arbitrary when transliterating Sanskrit, as the written lan
guage made no distinction between upper and lowercases. I will use an upper
case for the proper name of an individual god or goddess while lowercasing
names that apply to groups, such as devas, asuras, daityas, indras, and so on
all classes of gods or demons.
I suspect that most of my colleagues will approve of these decisions about
Sanskrit orthography. I also suspect that even a student in the first year of San
skrit studies will be able to move from these popular spellings to their Deva
nâgarî (Sanskrit alphabet) equivalents. If so, the Handbook should meet the
needs of the widest variety of readers.
There is a trend not to italicize well-known religious literature such as the
Christian Bible, but then one finds oneself looking to Webster’s Dictionary to
see if the Vedas should be italicized or not. For consistency’s sake, all Hindu
scripture, well-known or not, will be italicized.
Certain names have become so well-known in English works and data
bases—such as Krishna (K·rs· ·na) and Vishnu (Vis· ·nu)—that hopefully the general
reader and those more familiar with Sanskrit and Hindu terminology will feel
equally comfortable.
Footnotes have been integrated into the text in all but a few cases. Likewise,
references to the precise scriptural text—for example, Mahâbhârata, Adi Parva,
chapter 167, verses 190–220, documenting Draupadî being cited as one of the
five ideal women of Hindu mythology—have been omitted as too technical for
current purposes. Select entries have additional readings to help the general
Preface xix



reader gain familiarity with the richness of bibliographic resources that are ever
increasing.
Finally, certain concepts that are so common as to need no explanation in aca
demic circles—such as sanskritization or brâhmanization (drawing an element of
the low tradition into the high tradition and giving it a Sanskrit name or term) or
orthoprax/heteroprax (opposing praxis or practice rather than belief of the ortho
dox and the heterodox)—will be discussed in chapter 1. Besides these common
notions (and even they will be explained briefly), each article will attempt to be
self-contained or need only the connected articles for fuller understanding.
Special thanks is due to ABC-CLIO and its fine editorial staff: to Todd Hall
man for his early leadership of the project, to Bob Neville, and to Anna
Kaltenbach. I am especially grateful for the careful reading of the manuscript
given by Silvine Farnell. Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not thank my Sanskrit
professors who, decades ago, introduced me to this wondrous language and its
literature, and to a host of dedicated scholars like Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty,
who have influenced this work in one way or another.

INTRODUCTION
M
ost Hindus do not separate myths from ordinary experience the way
Hindu philosophers and theologians do. Hindu intellectuals make
sophisticated distinctions between existential truths (what you
experience with your own senses and know from your own experience) and
what others teach. The Buddha taught his followers to test everything in life
and only believe what they had verified through their own life experiences.
Most Hindu intellectuals are very comfortable with the Buddha’s counsel as a
beginning point for their explorations. Yet, even in the thinking of most intel
lectuals, and as for other Hindus, there has always been some room for the
imaginal—for myth.
Many historians of religions insist that what distinguishes a myth from a
legend is myth’s dealings with gods and demons—legends deal with humans,
especially heroes and heroines. However, this distinction does not hold well
in India. In Hindu narratives gods and demons are brought into even the most
ordinary legend, seemingly as a device of the storyteller that warrants it being
heard. There is such a familiarity with the sacred that the supernatural adorns
almost everything. From another perspective, Lee Siegel has connected this
attitude with India’s fondness for magic and the belief that magical powers are
both a sign of the divine and an attribute of those gifted by the divine. Siegel
has shown, in The Net of Magic, that India utilizes magic so freely that one
cannot easily gain attention without it. Thus India’s mythology seems filled
to a higher degree with magical or miraculous elements than other mytholo
gies are. The extent of this infilling with the miraculous will be explored in
these pages.
This text will follow the academic custom of not capitalizing the words god
and demon. This can be justified from most Hindu perspectives as well, since
the Absolute, the Supreme Being, is not being referred to as a whole. When the
Absolute, or the entirety of the Godhead, is indicated, then God will be capital
ized. There is no theological truth claim intended.

THE LIVING POWER OF HINDU MYTHOLOGY
A Hindu does not have to “believe in” the details of the myths. These details are
open to variation. In fact, there are often many versions of the same story, and one
version may contradict the details of another. A Hindu can participate in the
mythic meaning of a tradition simply by identifying with the myth’s ability to
help one locate oneself within the community’s worldview. Insiders will find
themselves at home within the worldview of their tradition’s myths; outsiders
will hear or read these myths and find them strange and even “untrue.” That is
the nature of being an outsider. For the insider, the myths will be validated sim
ply in the experience of belonging to a community. For the outsider, the same
myths will be objects outside of one’s experience. However, even the outsider can
see universal themes—mythology’s timeless contributions to human reflection.
Any study of myth that does not recognize myth’s potential to be alive and
existentially powerful, even in modern life, has missed something. Myths are
not true in any scientific sense—nor are they true philosophically, theologically,
metaphysically, or ontologically (that should about cover all the perspectives
that study absolute truth). Myth’s power arises from its ability to articulate the
existential need for identity. Myth answers questions about origin or creation
(where we came from), purpose and meaning (why we are here, what we should
do with our lives), morality (what is right or wrong), and destiny (above all what
happens at and after death). Myths are not children’s stories. They are often vio
lent and filled with sexuality. There are many reversals; sometimes the people
who are supposed to be good (such as teachers or priests) turn out to be bad
examples in a particular version of a myth. That is why the hearer has to be
alert—or have a good teacher. The many versions treat a theme or topic from
many different angles and teach more than a single “true answer.” The cast of
characters, the themes, and even the core meanings of the entire mythology
become second nature to the insider. One comes to know what one’s culture
believes about itself and what it expects.
MYTHIC IDENTITIES
Cultural and religious identity in Hinduism is amazingly broad. In Hindu
mythology there are as many as 330 million different role models (gods, or
devas) that can validate an individual identity. One’s identity is not stereotyped
by being a Hindu; there is not just one way to approach life. One’s appropriation
of this vast treasury of wisdom is one’s own responsibility (that is what the
notion of karma is about—personal responsibility for each and every action
2 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



and svadharma—one’s own appropriation of truth and one’s responsibility to
live what one’s own karma has necessitated).
Thus, a living mythology is quite different from a dead one. One does not
study Hindu mythology in the same way one studies Greek mythology. Or if one
does study Hindu mythology as dead, or monolithic, one will never grasp its cur
rent power. There are still hundreds of millions of Hindus who appropriate
Hindu mythology into their own lives in a variety of ways. We will study Hindu
mythology’s general patterns and articulations, constituting its macro, or larger,
view. However, there are microscopic versions of Hindu mythology: hundreds of
millions of Hindus have their own understandings and live their own appropria
tions. One must never say, “I know all about Hindu mythology,” even with a
mastery of the macro level. A living mythology is full of surprises, since every
Hindu potentially may appropriate Hindu mythology in her own way. One must
be humble and realize that every Hindu is the authority about her own appro
priation of Hindu mythology and what each believes is just that—what is true
for her (and that is the micro level of mythology).
ALIVE WITHIN HINDU MYTHS
Roy Amore and Larry Shinn, in Lustful Maidens and Ascetic Kings, described
what it is like to grow up with Hindu myths and stories:
To grow up in India is to mature in a world alive with demons and water
nymphs, goblins and irate goddesses. Wisdom is often measured not by
degrees or formal education, but by the ability to tell the right story or recite
a passage of scripture appropriate to a particular situation. Mothers and
fathers teach their children religious and family responsibilities through sto
ries. Householders scold their servants with reference to the fate of a charac
ter in a particular tale. In classical times, the student priest had to commit to
memory vast quantities of scriptures, which varied in subject matter from the
techniques of sacrifice to the proper conduct of the king in peacetime and at
war. The moral tales and fables as well as myths relating the feats of the gods
were common fare for any person who sought to be educated.1
HINDU WORLDVIEWS
Before any attempt to describe a mythology that has remained alive for four mil
lennia, a brief summary of the most basic Hindu beliefs, of the Hindu world
view, is needed. A summary from the prevalent “Hindu Renaissance” point of
Introduction 3



view, given by Prof. D. S. Sharma, should be adequate for our needs.2 Sharma
stated that Hindus share a unity within diversity, a unity that has five common
alities: (1) a common scripture (the Vedas); (2) common deities (one supreme
spirit, Brahman, with many manifestations); (3) a common set of beliefs in the
evolution of the world, the organization of society (varna dharma), the progress
of the individual, the fourfold ends of human life (as ́rama dharma), and the law
of karma and samsâra (rebirth); (4) common ideals; and (5) a common group of
practices (varna-as ́rama-dharma), leading toward deification through worship
(pûjâ, japa, bhakti), yoga, knowledge (jñâna), and meditation (dhyâna, samâdhi).
Sharma admitted that there is great latitude in the ways Hindus understood each
of these five elements. It is that very latitude that myth often explores best. These
basic concepts will be developed more at the end of this chapter.
This statement of commonalities represents an attempt to characterize the
majority of Hindus in the present. Yet, even though a living mythological tradi
tion currently shares common beliefs, there has also been a “situated tradi
tion”—with particularities that require attention to more aspects of the
tradition. The entire tradition must be studied within historical periods or con

texts; within myth cycles, perspectives, and communities; within cognitive ways
of understanding; and within broad cultural themes. To these we now proceed.
HISTORICAL CONTEXTS OF HINDU MYTHS
Myths are situated within historical periods. The same myth told in the
medieval period of India as it was articulated in the Purânas (a body of scriptures
of later Hinduism) may differ from earlier contexts and meanings. For example,
S ́iva has not always been the same supreme deity that he became in some of the
Purânas. There was no Lord S ́iva in the earliest extant stories of the Âryas (angli
cized as Aryans), a people who were the Sanskrit-speaking arrivals to the Indian
subcontinent approximately four millennia ago (though since the “arrival
hypothesis” and the non-Aryan origin of S ́iva are controversial, both will be dis
cussed later). The origins of myths about S ́iva appear to be among the native,
tribal, or indigenous peoples who did not speak Sanskrit. So even the name of
this god would have been in a tongue that was not part of the central commu
nity that was evolving into what would later be called Hindu.
Pre-Aryan Period (c. 2500–1700 B.C.E., Indus Valley or Dravidian civilization)
Indian culture has many roots. Two of the most important for modern Hinduism
are the Indus Valley culture (c. 2500–1700 B.C.E.) and the Aryan culture (appear
ing in the Indus region around 1500 B.C.E.). The indigenous culture of the Indus
is shrouded in mystery, as its script has defied translation. However, its archeo
logical remains are extensive and seem to suggest some correspondences to later
Hindu mythology. Indologists maintain a Web site to track activity and claims
on the subject: http://www.indology.org. The tiny “sealings” that may have
been used to label grain bags depict mythical beings of great imagination—beasts
that are often a composite of real and imaginary creatures. Some have multiple
heads, others a single horn. Taken together with the archeological sites, these
sealings have allowed scholars to construct a picture of the mythology of the
Indus Valley culture (or Harappan culture, as it has been named after one of its
principal cities): (a) male gods worshiped by the ruling elite; (b) yogic practice
and a lord of yoga, called the proto-S ́iva; (c) mother goddesses worshiped by the
masses; (d) public baths for ritual bathing; (e) tree spirits; (f) worship of snakes
(later known in Sanskrit as nâgas) and theriomorphic (animal-shaped) beings,
images of which were often tied to ritual objects to indicate their imminent sac

rifice. (For a slightly dated but elegantly written summary of this culture, see
Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God: Oriental Mythology [New York: Viking
Press, 1962], pp. 155–171.)
The Vedic or Samhitâ Period (c. 1500–900 B.C.E. Aryan Civilization)
The Vedas, the sacred scriptures of the Âryas, define both a period of time and a
culture. Almost all who consider themselves Hindu believe that the Vedas are
eternal, that they exist eternally at the most subtle level. However, they must
have become manifested in the form that scholars study them at some point in
time. Therefore, it should not be offensive to even the most ardent Hindu fun
damentalist that scholars have found that point of time to be less than four mil
lennia ago, or more precisely, circa 1500 B.C.E.
The Aryan culture appeared full-blown on Indian soil in the Rigveda, a col
lection (samhitâ) of more than a thousand hymns (rik-s), which later became the
first of three (triya) and then four Vedas. The three Vedas were the Rigveda,
Sâmaveda, and Yajurveda. These, plus the Atharvaveda (a collection full of
shamanic magic), became the Samhitâs and the first limb of a later conception

The oral Sanskrit prayers became the holy Vedas. (TRIP)



of the fourfold Veda that then included the Samhitâs (collections that included
the Rigveda), Brâhmanas (commentaries), Âranyakas (forest texts), and Upan
ishads (a treasury of mystical and devotional texts). But the fourfold Vedas
evolved slowly in several stages.
The Vedic language was Sanskrit, with mythic and ritual elements memo
rized by priests, and unwritten for almost a millennium. Whether the Aryans
were indigenous or arrived as warrior nomads from the steppes of Russia is a
matter of contentious debate, reflecting agendas of colonialism and indepen
dence, postmodernism and Hindu fundamentalism. However interpreted, this
culture contributed much to Hindu myths from its vast solar pantheon (Sûrya,
Indra, Ushas) and its fire rituals and sacrifices (agni yâgas, literally “fire sacri
fices”). By approximately 1200 B.C.E. Rigvedic mythology had reached its great
est expanse, and its influence over later Indian history was enormous. In fact,
each succeeding age has related back to some remembered or imagined Vedic
(i.e., Rigvedic) past, to which they have usually claimed to be the heirs. The
exception would be those who consistently used the catur-yuga (four ages) the
ory of declining righteousness and thought that the Vedas were no longer suited
for an evil age—only later scriptures like the Purânas.
The Brâhmanical and Aranyâka Period (c. 900–c. 600 B.C.E.)
The mythological point of view changed between the period of the Samhitâs
(collections) and that of the Brâhmanas (commentaries). The Brâhmanas were
more concerned with ritual and its effectiveness and less concerned with the
older Rigvedic gods (devas). The role of Agni, the god of fire, had increased, and
the symbolism of the fire sacrifice was more explicit. In the later Brâhmanas
there were thirty-three devas, enumerated as eight vasus, eleven rudras, and
twelve âdityas—with two gods unnamed. The period of the Brâhmanas and
Âranyakas (forest texts) reached its fruition approximately 900 B.C.E. This
period witnessed the ascendancy of the brâhmanas (priests), referred to in
English as brâhmans and brâhmins, to the top of a social hierarchy, the caste
system. The foundation had already been laid for the priestly assertion that
their role was more essential than that of the Vedic gods, since they knew and
controlled the sacrificial rituals. A tension between Brâhmanical (sacrificial)
religion and later forms of Hinduism that tended to subordinate Vedic sacrifice
became a constant in both the liturgy and the mythology from this point
onward.
Introduction 7



The Upanishadic Period (c. 900–c. 600 B.C.E.)
This period, the time of the major Upanishads (though minor Upanishads were
produced for many more centuries), saw at first a reaction to and revolt against
the caste system led by priests and against the blood sacrifices to the Vedic gods.
Later, however, these texts were coopted by the priestly (orthoprax) tradition and
made the fourth Veda—and for a majority of Hindus this most important and
last section of the Vedas has been referred to in English as Vedânta (anta, or
“end,” of the Vedas).
About half of the Upanishads were mystical and unitive, speaking of expe
riencing the divine as the one (ekam), while the other half promoted devotion to
one or more deities. New gods and goddesses were celebrated, and devotional
practices began to be introduced.
About this time (c. 600 B.C.E.) non-Hindu elements (Buddhist, Ajivika, Jain,
and later elements from invaders such as the Yanavas, Shakas, and Pahlavas) made
their “heteroprax” contributions (“other” or “alien practice”) to Hindu mythol
ogy—such as temples, indoor shrines, and rituals modeled after service to a divine
king. One can find ascetics (munis, yogis, samnyâsîs, tapasvins, and taposdhanas)
on the periphery and among indigenous people (Dravidians, tribals). Renunciate
traditions contributed elements that questioned blood sacrifice and the killing of
animals, and promoted asceticism (even the gods should constrain themselves),
vegetarianism, and much more. But within a few centuries, these too would be
integrated into orthoprax, Brahmânical religion. All of these elements were picked
up by Hindu mythology and modified in the following periods.
The Epic Period (c. 400 B.C.E.–c. 400 C.E.)
The period of India’s great epics, the Mahâbhârata and Râmâyana, continued
the expansion of mythology, emphasizing divine action on earth in incarnations
and manifestations. Gods and demons multiplied as did their stories. Epic
mythology foreshadowed the rich polytheism of the next two periods. The
Mahâbhârata contained two appendices that were extremely important sources
for later mythological development, the Bhagavad Gîtâ and the Harivams ́a.
The Purânic Period (c. 300–800 C.E.)
The mythology of the Purânas can be broken into three periods (300–500;
500–1000; 1000–1800), or the whole period may simply be referred to as the
Hindu middle ages or medieval period. During the previous periods, everything
had been prepared for the banquet of Hindu mythology. Its table was now a
8 Handbook of Hindu Mythology

smorgasbord of mythic delights. Everything from the past could be found on the
table, but most elements were characterized by new mixtures, with Hindu sec
tarianism on one hand (with each sect centered around one of the principle gods
and goddesses—Vishnu, S ́iva, or Devî) or Hindu universalism on the other (all
paths are the same; all paths lead to the Absolute). The three sub-divisions
within this period help locate in time historical developments within the sec
tarian communities, the rise and decline of Tântrism and its influence on main
stream mythology, the tendencies in Purânic mythologizing of subordinating
Vedic gods and past heroes to ever-increasing moral weaknesses, and the like.
This is a period of exuberant polytheism.
The Tântric Period (c. 900–c. 1600)
Imbedded within the Purânic period was a shorter one of Tântra and S ́âkta, so
called from the s ́aktî, or cosmic energy, associated with the Divine Mother
(Devî). This period appeared full-blown by 900. Some say that it finally became
visible again, having disappeared from historical sight at the time of the Aryan
dominance of indigenous, Indus Valley culture. Some say that it never died and
that it continues secretly today. Others point to a revival encouraged by the New
Age movement in the West. And indeed, it is true in some way about every
period of mythology in India. The old myths and beliefs do not really die but are
reborn, though usually in a metamorphosis, to continue into the present. Dur
ing the Tântric period, the mythology of Tântra and S ́âkta revived and enriched
blood sacrifice and the pursuit of pleasure as central themes. Tântra’s stories dif
fered radically in meaning from those of epic mythology, which favored devo
tion, asceticism, and duty.
The Modern Period
The modern period is said to begin with Râja Rammohan Roy (1772–1833), who
was a century ahead of his civilization, if not of world civilization. Roy
demythologized Hindu mythology a century before Rudolf Bultmann demythol
ogized Christianity. Roy particularly opposed the Purânas and their polytheism,
championing a rational and sometimes mystical interpretation of the Upan
ishads. The analysis of “core mythologies” begun by Rammohan Roy is not
within the scope of this study; briefly, it promises a way for a culture’s mythol
ogy to be studied in order to see its influence even when that influence is
unknown or denied.
The modern period also contributed two quite different approaches—the
revivalism of such figures as Svâmî Vivekânanda (1863–1902) or Svâmî Dayâ
10 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



nanda Sarasvati (1824–1883) and of Hindu fundamentalism (ranging from the
Hari Krishnas to the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh, simply known as the RSS).
One of the novel uses of mythology by Hindu fundamentalists has been in the
conversion or reconversion of Indian tribals and nonscheduled classes (modern
India’s name for former outcastes). Myths were found or invented to make trib
als or former “outcastes” Hindu and bring them within the cultural whole of a
reconstructed Hindu mythological community.
SOURCES: ORAL TRADITION, TEXTS, SCRIPTURES—AND MODERNITY
Besides the scriptural tradition that names each of the periods of Indian history,
there are oral traditions. Among the oral sources are storytellers (including
astrologers, palm-readers, priests, and teachers), plays (India’s great dramatic tra
dition, received by the masses in live performances), and even movies and tele
vision (some say half of India’s movies and television shows are productions of
the myths or retellings in some modern form). Allusions and references to the
myths are made constantly in everyday conversation and enrich life by giving it
points of comparison with India’s long and complex mythology.
However, the sources that are easiest to study in English are the written
resources—and many have been translated from Sanskrit and Hindi, as well as
from India’s regional languages, half of which are not related to Sanskrit. Some
collections, like the Pañchatantra, are literary documents, not scripture. How
ever, most of the resources for the study of myths are considered sacred—they
constitute Hindu scripture. Because of the Indian notion that most Hindu scrip
ture is timeless, there is some potential offense in handling it historically. Nev
ertheless, by using internal and external evidence (references within the text,
words that are datable by looking in all extant Indian literature and finding the
very first occurrence of that word, historical and archeological findings), schol
ars (both Indian and non-Indian) are able to date Hindu scriptures to the period
in which they were composed, give or take one or two centuries.
MYTH CYCLES, PERSPECTIVES, AND COMMUNITIES
Hindu myths are most often nested within much larger myth cycles. For exam
ple, the rebirth of Vishnu as a dwarf to rescue the gods (devas) from the rule of
the demon king Bali is nested within the Vishnu cycle of myths. One could view
Vishnu from many perspectives. (For example, pan-Hindu, sectarian, and non
Introduction 11



dualistic, or advaitan. But whatever the perspective and its influence on inter
pretation, all knew the stories of Vishnu’s coming down to earth in at least ten
different incarnations (avatâras), including the dwarf avatâra. Minor characters
in each of the myths would be known both individually and in relation to the
larger stories.
Given this complexity, several approaches must be taken to study Hindu
mythology. No single approach helps the student learn the entire story, discover
the elements both above and below this story (a process of nesting one story
within another), and keep track of all the characters and special terms found in
a single myth.
There are many versions of a story, both oral and written, and the stories are
retold not only in Hindu versions but also in Buddhist and Jain versions. For
scholarly exploration one usually must pursue these variations in primary tex
tual sources, dissertations, or journals that work with original languages and
sources. However, these variations are not unusual when the stories are told in
daily life in India. In fact, myth tellers themselves often refer to another myth or
indicate a specific version of a myth. These cross references demonstrate just
how familiar Indian audiences are with multiple versions of the myths, so that
a myth maker or teller can “play the myths” much like a musician who chooses
the right chords to syncopate a rhythm or modify a melody, creating ever differ
ing or familiar renditions at will.
UNDERSTANDING MYTHICALLY
How do Hindus understand their myths? In a living tradition mythology func
tions dynamically within the culture—ranging from narrowly Hindu to broadly
pan-Indian. At the same time, there will be numerous ways that Hindus under
stand their myths. One might be tempted to say, as some scholars have, that
there are as many ways as there are Hindus. But there are several general pat
terns that deserve specific mention.
Literalistic
The literal understanding of the core mythology of one’s community is the
beginning point. All children take stories literally until they are initiated into a
myth’s special kind of deception. (Some American children can believe in Santa
Claus literally until five or six, but seldom longer than seven, and all experience
“the wounding of consciousness,” or “loss of naïveté,” perhaps at the hands of a
12 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



knowledgeable peer.) However, religious myths may be lived and believed liter
alistically for a lifetime. Reform Hindus have appealed to psychology (specifi
cally theories of cognitive development, personality development, and child
psychology) and even neurophysiology (specifically theories of brain develop
ment) to argue against holding a majority of people at this stage of cognitive
development.
Nevertheless, there is something special about medieval and modern Hindu
culture that permits a literalistic understanding of Hindu mythology for a life
time without damage. Gods and demons are not outgrown. Priests, who might
not be literalistic in their own faith, often justify the literalizing of Hindu myths
for their “childlike” followers.
Hindu fundamentalists in modern times have added a new dimension—tak
ing a narrow view of a literalistic Hinduism that does not tolerate other views.
Slogans seldom translated into English include “India for Hindus” and “Drive
Muslims and Christians out of India.” Literalized myths about the incarnation
of Vishnu as King Râma and about his birthplace, Ayodhya, figure prominently
in their militant fundamentalism. Their power rests upon a noncritical, nonhis
torical approach to living myths.
Sectarian
Biology is informing us about our human behavior of taking our group or com
munity to be the only one that is true. In religion this is called sectarianism
that only one sect or religion is true; all others are not. There is an overlap
between sectarian religion and sectarian mythology.
During the middle ages of India many examples of sectarianism in Hindu
mythology emerged. This happened chiefly in Hindu devotionalism, where
Vishnu, S ́iva, and Devî (the Mother Goddess) competed as supreme deities. Log
ically there can only be one supreme deity of the universe. Followers champi
oned one or the other of these three and literalized all of Hindu mythology into
myth cycles that proved their god or goddess to be Supreme. (Followers of these
three respective deities are called Vaishnavas, S ́aivas, and S ́âktas.)
Pan-Indian
This is a cultural approach. The myths are known as stories (as Americans know
the story of George Washington and the cherry tree). The myths inform cultural
expectations about truth telling, about relationships, about society. The myths
Introduction 13



are felt. They inform one’s identity. They can be questioned and can even be
doubted, but one identifies with a Hindu view of life and does not reject it. Thus,
Hindu mythology still helps one to be Indian.
Reformed
The reformed and pan-Indian way of understanding often overlap. Rammohan
Roy, the great Hindu reformer, believed that the mythic frame of reference had
to be outgrown for Indians to “progress” from “superstition” to scientific and
rational thinking and living. He foreshadowed modern movements in philoso
phy and theology to “demythologize” religion. He used the principles in the
Vedas, especially in the Upanishads, to critique Hindu mythology and pointed
out that myth was not literally true but only pointed to something higher than
itself. Myth was never more than a symbol of truth. Thus, the myths and the
gods were metaphors of truths, and if believed literally myths became idols. He
did not mean idol in the Purânic sense of mûrti—physical forms that help the
worshipper to conceive of the formless divine. Rammohan Roy meant that
mythic thought and idols led to “idolatry”—worshipping something that was
both false and dehumanizing. He thought it led to deceiving oneself and others.
Living at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Roy did not have the ben
efit of modern psychological research on human cognitive development to
reconstruct what he had deconstructed. Roy did not see a value in mythology,
even for children, but he might have modified his total rejection of mythology
had he lived today. Indeed, the basis for using mythology developmentally was
part of his interpretation of myth—that myths served as pointers to the truth, to
the Absolute, no more. Just how deceptive they are and whether or not a “decep
tive” notion might be developmentally necessary for easier comprehension is
the issue he might have addressed if he had been born in the twentieth or
twenty-first century. This has not been adequately addressed in modern Hin
duism (for example, from Svâmî Vivekânanda to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan) and
will have to remain beyond the scope of this study.
HINDU MYTHOLOGY’S CONTRIBUTION TO WORLD MYTHOLOGY
Besides its adaptation from period to period within India, Hindu mythology has
been assimilated into other mythologies or worldviews. Early explorers of India
brought back stories about yoga and the wonders of the faqirs (Persian for illu
14 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



sionists or magicians). Translations of the Upanishads by Rammohan Roy were
read by Emerson and Thoreau and influenced American Transcendentalism and
its notion of the oversoul.3 However, it was Hindu mythology’s influence on
Theosophy and Christian Science that bore more direct fruit. The New Age
movement is a second or third generation of succession from this earlier influ
ence. Hindu mythic themes and attitudes thrive in this new soil. Even as Ken
Wilber4 was outgrowing and rejecting the New Age movement of which he had
been the greatest theorist, Hindu philosophy’s influence on him cannot be
denied. It has become a fixture in American—and more broadly Western—cul
ture, creating new mythologies.5
Finally, let us turn to Hindu mythic themes—those that are nearly univer
sal in the mythologies of the world and those that are more specific to Hindu
mythology.
HINDU MYTHIC THEMES: UNIVERSAL
All mythologies probe the great themes of life: good and evil, the purpose of liv
ing, death and what lies beyond, struggle and suffering, challenge and determi
nation, hope and perseverance. Some themes address a time before human life
began—cosmic time at the beginning, or what was before the beginning of time.
Other themes probe an ambiguity in existence that stretches concepts of good
and evil, making them relative to an absolute perspective—ethics viewed from a
divine or cosmic viewpoint.
As already noted, Hindu myths presuppose entire core systems, of which
there are many. Amazing contradictions populate Hindu mythology, and yet
these have not been a problem, as each hearer has been located in one of the
many Hindu identities and its corresponding mythological core system. This
applies both within a given period (as in the Vedic period or in the present) and
within the membership of a particular community (as a Vaishnava—a worship
per of Lord Vishnu—or as a Tântra—a member of a sect with its distinctive core
mythology and so on).
Myths speak of various ways that life has come to be as it is. There are a
number of explanations as to why life is so miserable (if it is). Later Hindu myths
with a single deity who is responsible for everything—creation, fate, destiny
speak of divine play (lîlâ) as one reason behind human suffering. However, earlier
conceptions involved ritual and its effectiveness: that human beings were
unhappy because the gods of the Vedic fire sacrifices had not been properly
appeased. Some myths taught that one’s fate was ruled by the cosmic justice of
karma—that one always reaped exactly what one sowed, whether in this lifetime
Introduction 15



or another. This would be “hard karma.” However, there could also be “soft
karma,” karma softened by grace and devotion—myths that told of a god or the
Supreme forgiving all one’s past deeds and awarding heaven, even when it was
not deserved by the “karmic facts.”
Thus, the myths accounted for evil or suffering in a variety of ways. Perhaps
the most remarkable notion was the news that there is no evil at all. Apparent
evil is but an illusion (mâyâ) from a cosmic or divine perspective. So, finally,
there is always hope. Hinduism is hardly pessimistic—as so many Westerners of
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have charged. Each Hindu mythology,
comprised of ever expanding circles of mythic elements and themes, had at its
disposal all the Hindu myths of all previous ages. And these included cosmolo
gies and cosmogonies, theogonies and theologies, theomachies, anthropogeneses
and anthropologies, eschatologies and soteriologies. (See the table above.)
However, to speak of these constructions—cosmologies and so on—was to
bring them to analytical consciousness as rational and narrative systems. That
is what a philosopher, a teacher, or a priest may do. The ordinary hearer only
needs to draw from the psychological, spiritual, and social resources of myth. By
the time there is analytical consciousness, there is already distance, doubt, and
danger of evolution and change. Mythology works best in the early stages of
human and civilizational development. However, the larger questions about life
and death have changed little.
The mythic way of addressing them was distinct to each culture at that
stage of development. So Hindu myths minister to persons struggling with life’s
existential crises and offer hope, suggest ways of cheating fate, and provide
examples of those who have not been fortunate.

Cosmogony, Theogony, and Anthropogony
How did the cosmos, the gods, and humans come into being? Which came first?
Some Hindu myths say that humans created the gods, so the order has been
debated.
Hindu mythology accounts for the origin of the cosmos (cosmogony) with
four of the five general cosmogonic solutions human beings have advanced, leav
ing out only the notion of creation from nothing. Many myths recall a cosmic
battle, such as the one between Indra and Vritra. This kind of cosmogony is com
mon in mythology, where creation comes from a victory over chaos. In the ear
liest Rigvedic hymns Vritra was a water demon (chaos), and Indra gained a
victory that brought order (and thus creation). An even older cosmogonic myth
had being come into existence as a cosmic egg, hiranyagarbha (a golden egg). It
appeared or was created—depending on the version. Creation by divine dismem
berment was another cosmogonic solution—the dismembering of the cosmic
man (purusha) or of Agni the fire god, who resided or hid in the depths of the
ocean; the latter joined two kinds of cosmogonic solutions (the separation of cre
ative fire from chaotic water and the creation by the ritual sacrifice of a god). The
“earth diver” as a cosmogonic solution can also be found in Hindu mythology,
in the story of when Vishnu in his incarnation as Varâha plunged into the ocean
and brought forth the earth (Bhûmî or Prithivî) from chaos. There were three
more solutions in Hindu mythology to the cosmogonic mystery: creation from
mind, creation from sound (vâc), and creation from parents (coition). The later
was the most common form of creation and re-creation in the later mythology
of the Purânas and had many versions.
Prajâpati was the first creator or father of all, but he was soon replaced with
Brahmâ. There was always something available for the production of life, the
most common source being the creator’s seed. Perhaps the most interesting cos
mogony was the “emission” (prasarga) of Brahmâ’s sons from his own mind
(making them mânasâ-putras, mind-born sons).
Some of these myths spoke of the creator becoming androgynous and pro
ducing offspring—a self-embrace transcending the opposition of male and
female. A few accounts had Prajapati or Brahmâ create a woman (a mind-daugh
ter) with whom he begot all beings. These births could either be by ordinary sex
ual relations or by magical means (tapas).
The creations (srishthis) had to be repeated again and again. Each age (kalpa)
was followed by its destruction (pralaya), and there would eventually be fourteen
great creations. We are now in the seventh age. Each age was ruled over by its first
human being, its Manu. And each age received the Vedas and was required to live
the dharma, but eventually would go into a decline that precipitated another
Introduction 17



destruction and another creation. (For more on time and the creations, see chap
ter 2.) So, which came first: time, the cosmos, or a god who created one or both?
Hindu mythology is rich in answers.
Cosmology
What is the nature of the cosmos? What are the various realms or regions of the
cosmos? Are there separate realms for the gods and demons?
In Indo-European mythologies there was usually a center of the earth
directly under heaven, supported or separated from heaven by a sacred mountain
or tree. In India that sacred mountain was Mount Meru, wider at the top than
the bottom. Meru was situated at the center of an island continent, surrounded
by an ocean. Around that island continent were six more concentric oceans and
six donut-shaped continents. Above were the heavens, below many underworlds
and hells. The sacred banyan tree was much like Meru in shape. A magical plant,
soma (the plant of immortality and of healing), grew on the mountains of heaven
but was brought to earth by Indra. Once the monkey god Hanuman had a diffi
cult time finding soma, so he simply brought a mountain with its magical herbs
to Râma, an incarnation of Vishnu.
In a late myth about the struggle between the gods (devas) and demons
(asuras), the snake Vâsuki was used as a rope to churn soma from the Great
Milky Ocean. The gods and demons had to work together to accomplish this, but
then they fought over the spoils. Finally, soma was replaced with rituals, aus
terities, and then devotion as means of sustaining or empowering the gods.
The sacred stories connected the landscape of India and Nepal to the gods.
Wherever the devas touched the earth, there was a potential site for a temple or
shrine—and a place for pilgrimage (tîrthas), a central element in Hindu devo
tional life. Each temple or group of temples tended to develop their own
mythologies, stories that proclaimed their importance and made clear why they
must be visited. “The most sacred place in India” varied over the centuries and
according to sectarian affiliations, but all lists would include most of the fol
lowing: Badrinath, Hardwar, Varanasi (Benares or Kâs ́î), Pushkara, and Prabhâsa
(Somnath). There were also asura tîrthas (pilgrimage sites of demonic activities
where demons had played a role), such as Gâyâ, where Vishnu vanquished the
demon Gâyâ, perhaps as allusion to the Buddha.
Once again myth has slipped over into what is thought of as the territory of
religion: rituals, pilgrimage, temple worship, and religious merit. However, in
India Hindu mythology is still living and plays a central role in religion, pil
grimage, art, literature, drama, and the subjects of modern film and video.
18 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Theogony and Theology
Where did the gods come from? What is their nature? Who are they? Are they
like us in form and character? What is our relationship to them? What do they
want from us?
The origin of the gods varied most in Vedic mythology. In the earliest
hymns some were simply there—Dyaus, the sky father, and Prithivî, the earth
mother. However, their time of honor was already over, and their myths were
not even retold. Then there were the central triad of gods—Sûrya, Indra, and
Agni. However, in the Vedas the title of creator is bestowed on Prajâpati, lord of
the beings or creatures. Yet there was no cosmogonic myth about him either. In
the Brâhmanas and Upanishads a cosmic force or process known as Brahman
would be either the totality of all that existed or the only Real, while all else was
merely apparent. However, Brahman was not an object of human narration and
thus not a proper subject of Hindu myth. In late theistic mythologies a supreme
deity (Vishnu, S ́iva, or Devî) was described as bringing everything into being
even time and causality (see chapter 2).
Theogony is composed of two Greek words—theos, or god, and gonia,
related to our genesis, or beginning. Thus, a theogony concerns the beginning of
the gods, where they came from, and their genealogy. Hindu polytheisms entail,
like all polytheisms, stories about the life of the gods, their families, and their
struggles for order (theomachies). They have a life! So a portion of Hindu
mythologies simply tells stories about the gods, answering basic questions about
their origin and activity. These stories are not pointless—they address social
concerns and personal salvation (soteriology).
If we begin with the latest developments of Hindu mythologies in the Purâ
nas, we find myths centered on a single god as the supreme deity of the universe.
There were three who competed for this honor: Vishnu, S ́iva, and Devî. Since
each of these deities was supreme for their devotees, there could be no myths of
origin for them. They each must be the cause and agency of everything that
exists. In other religious traditions, we would find any study of a supreme deity
leaving mythology and entering a more rationalized theology. However, in
Purânic “Hinduisms” myths were still constructed about the supreme deity,
even though Supreme Being would be beyond having a life that was imaginable
in human terms or amenable to story.
The S ́iva of Purânic mythology was either supreme or subordinate to Vishnu
or Devî. S ́iva’s core mythology included his marriage to Pârvatî or Umâ or both.
He had two sons, Ganes ́a and Skanda (or Kârttikeya). His vehicle was Nandi, the
bull. Kailâsa was his abode. Although all Hindus would probably know the
entire myth cycle and its elements, the themes of supremacy or inferiority
Introduction 19



S ́iva and key visual elements of his core mythology (TRIP)



would totally alter the meaning (and even the details) of any episode depending
on whether S ́iva is seen as supreme or inferior to the Supreme Being. Both
Vishnu and Devî had their own myth cycles demonstrating that each could also
claim supremacy and be seen as the sole origin of the universe.
In most later Hindu mythologies, Brahmâ was considered the creator god or
at least given that title. He might be presented as having “mind-children” or as
being the divine parent directly. In the latter kind of story, Brahmâ created a
female with whom he then had children. Later Hindu thinkers charged Brahmâ
with incest, because this was seen as marrying his own daughter, who was called
Vâc (speech). Brahmâ’s role was further compromised by the sectarian mytholo
gies that made S ́iva, Vishnu, or Devî the author and creator of the universe—the
only self-existent (svayambhû) one. Eventually, Brahmâ was depicted as only
sitting on a lotus flower growing out of the navel of Vishnu, his function to cre
ate each new age, only to fall asleep or to be destroyed in the cyclic doomsday
(mahâpralaya), to be reborn anew from the thought of the real creator, Vishnu
(or one of the other supreme deities). Later mythology changed the Vedic myth
of the spontaneous appearance of the golden egg (hiranyagarbha), from which
the universe emerged, to its origin upon the release of Brahmâ’s seed into the pri
mordial ocean. Both Brahmâ and the cosmic egg had become subordinate parts
of other myths.
The gods were also bothered by marital problems. The great ascetic S ́iva,
lord of yoga, was troubled as much as any human with love and family life. Some
myths resorted to magic to overcome S ́iva’s asceticism (portraying the god as
being shot by one of Kâma’s magical love arrows), some to feminine wiles, some
to common sense—surely S ́iva would be attracted to his beautiful wife. Other
myths had him chasing his wives from one lifetime to the next, even in the form
of animals. Their lovemaking in these myths even threatened the universe with
an early destruction. From a mythological point of view these stories can be seen
as an extension of the cosmogonic battle to create, now projected into the chaos
of male-female relationships.
The gods must be followed through their mythic relationships. Vishnu has
a wife or consort who goes by two names, S ́rî and Lakshmî—although some
times the names belong to separate individuals. In later myths she was known
as Mahâlakshmî and Bhadrakâlî. Vishnu’s second wife is Bhû Devî (the earth
goddess). His vehicle was Garuda, the sun bird. During his sleep at the end of an
age, Vishnu reclined on his serpent—either S ́esha (the remainder) or Ananta (the
endless one, eternity). But to complete the myth of Vishnu one must know the
stories of each of his ten avatâras—fish, tortoise, boar, man-lion, dwarf, Râma
the Ax Wielder, Râma of the Râmâyana, Krishna, the Buddha, and Kalki.
S ́iva was first associated with Rudra and then became a being in his own
Introduction 21



right. He was married to Pârvatî, by whom there were two children, Ganes ́a and
Skanda (or Kârttikeya). Durgâ is also his wife in some myths. His vehicle is
Nandi (or Nandin), the bull. He is lord of yoga, lord of the animals (pasupati), and
lord of the dance (natarâja). He is the only god who left a part of himself to be
worshiped by his devotees, the linga. His manifestations have the same purpose
as Vishnu’s incarnations of ending evil or granting grace, but his sovereignty over
the universe was preserved in another way. In one of his manifestations he is
united with his feminine power (his s ́aktî, in other stories enjoying a separate
existence as S ́aktî, his wife) so that he becomes androgynous. As a s ́arabha (a
fierce mythical animal), he is able to conquer the boar avatâra of Vishnu—yet
another manifestation of his supremacy.
Devî is encountered in many feminine manifestations; the first is Durgâ
(who was at first associated with Vâc). Some of these manifestations are terrify
ing (Durgâ, Mahishamardinî, Candikâ, Kâlî, Vindhyavasinî, Câmundâ, and many
more), others quite benevolent (Satî, Umâ, Pârvatî, S ́ivâ, and Gaurî). Any of these
goddesses might be portrayed as a wife or consort of a god, or they can be a man
ifestation or the emphasis may be on her power as a manifestation of Devî—and
therefore beyond any subordination to a mere husband. Devî also appeared as
Yoganidrâ (cosmic sleep), Vishnumâyâ (world illusion), Ambikâ (the mother),
and S ́aktî (divine energy).
Theomachy
What kept creation from being perfect? Against whom do the gods fight? Who
are the demons or the demonic forces? Where did they come from? Why do they
seek to destabilize the divine order that the gods created? How do they get their
power? Will there ever be a final victory over evil and disorder?
Vritra, opponent of Indra in the Rigveda, had no genealogy (theogony). Vri
tra was a personification of chaos. Later demons (asuras) were born from the very
same Prajâpati (progenitor or grandfather) as the gods, Kas ́yâpa. However, in
many of the myths the asuras were the older brothers of the gods (or, much later,
cousins) and therefore were the rightful rulers of heaven and earth. How they
lost their right to rule was a recurring theme of the myths. During the ritualis
tic periods of the Vedas and Brâhmanas, it was the sacrifices that sustained the
power of the gods, so they fought over their share. However, this situation
taught nothing but brute force, cunning, or deception. Later, as faith in the sac
rifices waned, the myths found a way around this problem. Ascetic practice
(tapas) could be engaged in by gods, demons, and humans with equal results: one
gave up pleasure to acquire power (siddhi or s ́aktî). This approach allowed an
22 Handbook of Hindu Mythology

ascetic morality by which there was a real struggle between forces of (relative)
good and (relative) evil. During the later mythology even devotional practices
were thought to be as effective as purely ascetic ones. It was by these practices
that magical powers (siddhis) could be acquired—invisibility, invincibility, or
an immortality that was always limited to an apportioned lifetime according to
one’s species. (The myths allowed six individuals (ciranjivis) to attain true
immortality, so that they would never die.) Hindu theomachy never completely
solved the problems involved in personifying the devas and the asuras and gave
mixed messages about the sources of evil and the purposes for good.
The gods (devas) typically fought the demons (asuras), and humans strug
gled with flesh-eating monsters (râkshasas). There were also other beings that
might just appear or be sent by the gods to steal ascetic power (s ́aktî), such as
the As ́vins, gandharvas, or apsaras (the divine twins, celestial musicians, and
celestial damsels—see entries in chapter 3).
There would be many stories told of the gods in combat with demons (theo
machies). Establishing and maintaining order was a recurring problem. Indra had
to defeat the serpent-dragon Vritra, and various gods reestablished order again and
again. Vishnu fought demons in each age, but only as an incarnation, or avatâra,
such as the fish, the boar, Krishna, or Râma, never in his own form as the Supreme.
There were always contests for supremacy—if not with another god or a demon,
then with a sage like Nârada. Ascetic practice, or tapas (giving up pleasure in order
to gain power), was the currency that made one a rival of the gods. Indra’s throne
heated up when god, demon, or sage gained too much power by their tapas. He was
thus forewarned, so he could act to protect his office as king (indra) of heaven.
In the Purânas it was not always clear who was supreme. Of course, it was
clear in the mind of a devotee of one of the three contenders for supremacy
S ́iva, Vishnu, and Devî (and that point of view is called sectarian). However, sto
ries abounded about the contests between them. The devotees of one particular
god wove a version of the myth to show how their god was lord of the universe.
For example, Devî took her s ́aktî (power—a feminine word ending in “î”) away
from Lord S ́iva. This was proved linguistically by a clever argument based on
Sanskrit’s syllabic spelling. With the i subtracted from the first syllable, s ́iva (the
auspicious one) becomes s ́ava (the corpse). In another example of sectarianism,
the story goes that Vishnu took the form of his boar avatâra, Varâha, and
plunged into the cosmic ocean, where he claimed that he had found the base of
the cosmic linga (the divine phallic form of S ́iva). Then he took the shape of the
divine eagle (Garuda), and after his flight he claimed that he had flown to the top
of the universe and seen its top, though the linga was known to be infinite by
S ́iva’s followers. Nandi, S ́iva’s bull vehicle, could not stand by and allow such
lies, so he kicked Vishnu in the forehead, knocking him silly (his devotees
24 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



thought that he was meditating). This blow left a hoofprint on the god’s fore
head, which Vishnu’s devotees copied, making on their own foreheads a distinc
tive mark (tîlaka) of three horizontal lines. These stories were endless.
Anthropogony
Where did we come from? Were humans always like this? How are we supposed
to live? What are the correct traditions? What are the laws we should live by?
Besides all of the creation or evolution stories, there were stories about the
four castes—brâhmins, kshatriyas, vais ́yas, and s ́ûdras. When human origin was
traced to the dismemberment of the cosmic man (purusha), the castes were
described as originating from different parts of his body. Humans were a part of
the same sacred web of being as animals, demons, and gods. Myths of declining
goodness (the yugas, the four ages) explained that humans were once great heroes
and teachers (gurus, rishis), but now there was an ever-lessening attention to
righteous living (dharma). The incarnations (avatâras) were necessitated by a
loss of the correct traditions found in the Vedas from which knowledge (jñâna)
of the eternal truths came. The divine rule of King Râma, himself an avatâra, had
clearly established the correct laws that should govern all of human life. Hindu
myths would have examples who are arch villains and true heroes and heroines,
both illustrating how life ought to be lived no matter what one’s station or cir
cumstance. There are the five great women (pañcakanayâs): Ahalyâ, Draupadî,
Mandodarî, Sîtâ, and Târâ. The five Pandava brothers have all the attributes of
greatness, and Arjuna certainly joins the select few as a great friend and devotee
of Krishna. Sages such as Vyâsa and Nârada abound with awesome powers. Kings,
maidens, prostitutes, rouges—from all castes and in all stages Hindu mythology
provides good and bad examples of our possibilities and our frailties.
MYTHIC THEMES: SPECIFIC
Dharma (life’s duty) and karma (ultimate responsibility), sin and error, knowl
edge and ignorance, mercy and grace, pollution and purification, mortality and
immortality, birth and fertility, asceticism and enjoyment, piety and ritualism,
demons and gods—these weave their way throughout Hindu mythology.
Dharma
What is righteousness? How can we know and do good? What is our duty?
Dharma is one of the most pregnant notions in Hindu philosophy, religion,
and mythology. It can be translated in English as religion, virtue, truth, or duty.
Introduction 25



For our purposes it is the duty that one is born into (varna-dharma, caste) and
the responsibilities one must shoulder according to one’s stage of life (as ́rama
dharma). In the Bhagavad Gîtâ Krishna told Arjuna that it is better for him to
do his own duty (svadharma) than to try to do someone else’s. Arjuna was try
ing to avoid the duty of a warrior and renounce war.
This varying standard according to caste and stage of life is constantly illus
trated in the myths. In the Epic and Purânic periods dharma became the stan
dard by which good and bad karma could be judged, as it meant that one had
performed one’s duty in that particular circumstance. But there will be a notice
able tension between dharma and tapas, duty and austerities, especially the
more magical austerities of the later myths. Unrighteous asuras (demons) are
able to practice severe tapas and gain their desires, usually for power over the
devas (gods). But there are humans who also use the fruits of their tapas to get
revenge, with some sages going so far as to curse others from the power of their
tapas with death or deformity. The ethical connections between dharma and
tapas, duty and austerities, truth and religious practice, will be given great lati
tude in some of the Purânic stories.
Karma
How does karma work? Does karma carry over from one lifetime to the next?
Karma is one of the causative principles of Hindu philosophy and mythology.
It is the accumulated results of actions done as causative instruments for future
blessing or punishments. In this wide-ranging mythology karma has both its hard
and soft versions—as will be discussed further in chapter 2 in “Nimitta (Causal
ity)”: one quite mechanistic in its strict sense of justice and punishment, the
other allowing for interventions such as divine grace. Hindu mythology never
defines its usages of karma but appeals to its eternal law in every narrative.
There is probably no single myth that illustrates karma better than the story
of Kamsa, the uncle of Krishna. This myth has a series of nested stories that go
forward and backward in time to examine the changing relationships of the prin
ciple characters and their karma. Kamsa’s karmic chain began at the beginning
of a new cosmic creation, at the beginning of this kalpa.
Kamsa was, in his first birth of this aeon, Kâlanemi, a son of Virocana, an
asura (demon) and the brother of Bali. The brothers were famous demons, which
would suggest that there had been a lot of bad karma in the previous kalpa.
Kâlanemi had six sons, whose bad karma from a previous lifetime was explicitly
stated in another myth. They had been the six sons of Marîci, a semidivine fig
ure clouded in some mystery. Marîci was associated with Indra and was appar
ently a marut, with powers of storm and battle. Marîci’s sons were so powerful
26 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



that they rivaled the creator, Brahmâ. They openly mocked him and accused
Brahmâ of marrying his daughter, Sarasvatî. Weakened by their own actions,
they were victims of Brahmâ’s curse—that they would be reborn as asuras. Thus,
they were born the sons of Kâlanemi, the future Kamsa.
The story goes back and forth to show good and bad actions of Kâlanemi and
his six sons. Kâlanemi was later born as Kamsa, and his six sons were reborn
twice before being born as Kamsa’s nephews. At that point they were born to
Devakî (mother of Krishna), and the Krishna nativity story tells how Kamsa
killed each of them. (For a concise retelling of this karmic puzzle, see the entry
on Kamsa in chapter 3.)
After many lifetimes of opposing Vishnu’s incarnations, Kamsa, or
Kâlanemi, was finally redeemed, as his karma burned out in the presence of the
Lord’s grace. The final fate of the six sons also demonstrated this dissolution of
karma by grace.
Samsâra or Transmigration
Cosmogonic questions take on a specifically Hindu character when the answers
involve transmigration. How does chaos become order? How does the undiffer
entiated one become many? What is the interrelation of all living things in the
cosmic web of being? How does rebirth work?
Samsâra (flow) points to a conception of the universe in constant change, a
universe following nature laws (dharma) and rhythms (yugas), the declining
ages of each cosmic cycle. Humans fit into a chain of life that Hindu mythology
explicates with stories about births and rebirths of the soul (jîva) on its path to
find the divine.
While transmigration seems to be the common territory of all Hindu reli
gions and philosophies, Hindu myths come at this concept from many differing
points of view and even conflicting solutions, sometimes offering alternatives
that are in direct conflict with prevailing religious and philosophical views. One
solution would involve the notion of the gotra (an order of being), positing long
chains of past lives in the various rebirth orders (gotras), and progression and
regression within the orders of being during many rebirths.
The problem of mythic and historical overlap can again be seen in the term
gotra. Although gotra currently means the ancestry or lineage of a brâhmin
(something like a Brâhmanical clan), the term was historically used before the
caste system came into existence and indicated a Vedic clan. Later in Hindu
mythology the notion of gotras was used as part of the solution to the problem
of how all orders of living things could come from the same parents (one prajâ
Introduction 27



pati and his wife). According to the Mahâbhârata (an Epic), four prajâpatis par
ticipated in the moment of creation of the current kalpa, thus placing all living
beings into four orders, four gotras. But this notion of some separation in cre
ation did not prevail, as it blurred the generally accepted idea of the intercon
nectedness of all beings.
Instead, a deep interconnection between the animal, human, demon, and
divine orders was seen to exist. Myths connected all living beings to the same
father or grandfather (prajâpati).
Kâla
What is time (kâla)? Was there a beginning and will there be an end to time?
What happens at the end of time? Is there something more in life than what is
apparent? What is our ultimate fate?
The various answers given by Hindu mythologies to these questions form
the material of the next chapter. In the earlier periods of Hindu mythology
knowledge of time, space, and causality (kâla-des ́a-nimitta) seems to be the req
uisite in ordering the rituals that control the devas that grant life’s blessings and
even arrange matters concerning life and death. In some of the Hindu mytholo
gies time (kâla) falls within the power and control of a supreme. In these
instances it is the Supreme that rules time and usually everything else; in such
a case kâla as time and kâla as death are totally in the hands of God, as will be
seen in chapter 2.
Cosmogonic Return to the One
The paradigmatic Hindu myth of the return to the one is that of the destruction
of the cosmos by S ́iva in one version or by Vishnu’s sovereign agency in another.
Everything goes back into the cosmic ground of being and will once again be
recreated into all the multiplicities of life. Yet there is a paradox: Despite being
dissolved in the divine fire of cosmic destruction, one’s karma survives (at least
the minor dissolutions, according to many myths) and one’s karmic chain con
tinues until divine grace intervenes.
Each re-creation demonstrates the interconnectedness of life, as the myths
connect the order of being—gods and demons, animals and birds, and humans,
every possible form of life—on the same web of being. In the mythic past, all
were able to talk together, compete with each other, and even mate with each
other. No other modern mythology survives into its modern religious traditions
28 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



to the same extent that Hindu mythology extends into modern Hindu traditions.
Stories of gods mating with animals or shape-shifting into animal form to have
animal progeny are still taken literally by many, which causes some adverse
reaction in outsiders—and Hindu reformers. In primordial or mythic time there
was shape-shifting from one species to another (changing orders of being). Rishis
mated with apsarâs (celestial damsels); gods like Indra were attracted to rishis’
wives and on occasion raped them (also the behavior of demons).
All this was not taken as confusion but related to the problem of primordial
unity (or chaos) before creation and differentiation into the separateness of cre
ation. Gods like Indra feared a return to the primordial unity where all orders of
being are truly undifferentiated, but gods like Indra did not necessarily represent
the highest wisdom. A return to oneness was seen as a desirable goal by the truly
wise. The paradigmatic situation was symbolized by a sage practicing austerities
in order to change the cosmic order—back to its original oneness.
A belief in an original undifferentiated oneness seems to be reflected in the
myth of Vishnu-Varâha and Bhûmî-devî, when it tells of their continuous love
play (lîlâ), lasting for three hundred years (some versions say a thousand). This
love play seems to be a re-creation of the cosmogonic moment of nondifferenti
ation before the separation of being and nonbeing and of male and female. There
are no offspring, only an embrace. This lovemaking is without the desire for a
climax or for offspring. It is without passion. This divine play became a model
for later Tântric practices in which the participants embraced as the divine
androgyne. And even as a divine couple became one, so also most myths would
agree that the entire differentiated cosmos ought to seek oneness in the
Absolute.
Renunciation, Sacrifice, and Magic
Renunciation, sacrifice, and magic are themes that are hardly unique to Hindu
mythology. However, the part they play in the myths is distinctive. Renuncia
tion (tapasya), when it first appeared, was in marked contrast to the various
kinds of life affirmation found in many early Hindu myths. Since it is so com
monly accepted that Hinduism in general and Hindu mythology specifically are
life-negating, one needs to be reminded that in the Vedic and Brâhmanical peri
ods in particular, long life and good health were worthy and constantly sought
goals. There were originally three stages of life (as ́ramas)—student, householder,
and retiree. One’s social and religious duties overlapped in a series of sacraments
(samskâras) that celebrated life and its activities. An artifact of that life affir
mation was the desire for the boon of immortality (ciranjîva). One sought to
Introduction 29



become immortal because there was nothing to escape. This existence was the
place of joy and blessing. Perhaps even reincarnation or transmigration (sam
sâra) began as an affirmation of the goodness of life.
However, from the time of the Buddha (c.600 B.C.E.) Hindu mythology devel
oped a new logic and emphasis. The pleasures and attractions of this life could be
renounced through ascetic practices (tapas), and by so doing one could acquire
supernatural or transhuman powers (siddhis) or creative energy (mâyâ, s ́aktî).
This new desire for divine powers led to a search for knowledge (jñâna) about
these powers and to practices (tapas, yoga, tântra) that helped in their acquisition.
Ascetic practices were developed extensively outside of Vedic religion
among the Ajivikas, Buddhists, Jains, and independent sages. But ascetic practice
became part of Hindu tradition in yoga and its supportive philosophies and the
ologies. It was a new form or conception of sacrifice. One would not perform a
blood sacrifice of an animal, involving its “murder” (as the Buddhist and Jains
charged in their call for ahimsa, which literally means non-murder and later
became non-injury). Asceticism embraced a change in consciousness that
included an individual (not a clan or group) who controlled his or her own
actions and desires. This mastery of the “self” seemed god-like, and the myths
taught that this is exactly how the gods and demons acquired their phenomenal
powers—through austerities, not conquests or fire sacrifices as earlier in the
Vedic age. So not only was a new individual consciousness produced, but also
austerity (tapas) and powers (siddhis) were connected in a new way. Now the
hearer of these new myths would learn of ascetic powers, those produced by
yoga, fasting, vows, pilgrimages, donations of wealth, and other tangible and
intangible sacrifices. All of these led to an experience of non-attachment or non
addiction to the ordinary things of life and the resulting power to operate in the
world with new strength—and even miraculous abilities (siddhis).
Myths often told of who practiced and what they achieved. Again, in pri
mordial time animals, humans, demons, and gods all practiced austerities,
acquired powers, used them against each other, and admired great accomplish
ment (tapasya), even when it might be used for unworthy ends—as was almost
always the case with the demons (asuras).
Austerities (tapas) that generated powers (siddhis) were thus not always
ascetic. Most myths not only linked austerities (tapas) with powers (siddhis) but
also linked the use of those powers with nonascetic and often immoral goals
(killings, cursings, and the like). One practiced tapas in order to gain siddhis.
The demons (asuras) usually would quit their practices (fasting, yoga, medita
tion, worship) as soon as they acquired the siddhi they sought (immortality,
invincibility, and the like). But some did not and made defeat impossible except
for intervention of the Supreme (in sectarian myths). Brahmâ, and sometimes
30 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Indra or other devas, granted the boon (vara) of a particular siddhi simply
because these austerities pleased the gods. At least so the mythmakers often
said; nevertheless, it seemed that Indra and the other gods were actually operat
ing under some kind of compulsion—if austerities were done, a boon had to be
granted. Something very much like the law of karma seemed to be at work. Seen
in this way, austerity (tapas) was analogous to Vedic sacrifice, which could be
seen as providing the devas with something they wanted so that they would give
human beings what they wanted, but which actually operated rather differently.
In fact the inner logic of tapas was quite close to the “science” of controlling the
gods with Vedic rituals, except that the rituals had been replaced by austerities.
The rewards for austerities could include heaven (svarga), but even in late
mythology the powers were often used for more ordinary human desires. Myths
about the way the asuras would first practice tapas to obtain a boon from
Brahmâ suggested that repeating a chant (mantra) of praise a thousand times
either pleased Brahmâ or obligated him to grant the desired boon. When tapas
was equated with purification rituals, austerity was linked to the notion of
penance. However, when one’s motive for becoming purified by austerities was
to obtain a siddhi of invincibility or immortality in order to be victorious in war,
that only emphasized the connection to magic (mâyâ).
Many myths mention the use of magic directly. The myth of Bala, an asura
(demon), mentioned that he knew and taught ninety-six kinds of magic to trou
ble the devas (divinities). Hanuman was said to practice the eight superhuman
powers (ashta siddhis). The asuras had a life-restoring magic (mritansañjîvanî)
that they had been using in their battles against the devas. It was this magic that
necessitated giving amrita, a potion that bestowed immortality, which was
churned up from the Milky Ocean, to the devas. S ́îlavatî was a wife who, by
practice of austerities (tapas), was able to cast a spell that prevented the sun
from rising.
The practical understanding of power as mâyâ (magical power) and s ́aktî
(creative energy) rested on a “science” of observation and experimentation that
proved the effectiveness of both ritual and ascetic practices. Brâhmins had con
cluded that rituals worked when done precisely, as did incantations of mantras
as prayers of praise or formulas of magical control. Further, this understanding
of mâyâ as control of the mysteries of life concluded that austerities (tapas) led
to powers that controlled nature, including the gods, or to the acquisition of any
object of desire, including heaven (svarga) or immortality. The mythological
view was the practical one: that there were practices (rituals, austerities, devo
tion, or a combination of these) that gave mortals some control over the results
of their action (connecting with karma) and hope for the future. Many, many
myths mention the use of magic directly, and many terms are used in the myths

for the practitioners of this art, as well as for the art itself: for example, mâyâvî
(one with power) or tapasvinî (magician) and indrajala (magic or illusionism).
In Hindu mythology renunciation, sacrifice, and magic did not always fol
low the clear logic of the philosophical systems (dars ́anas), but the myths do
intend to be logical: Theirs is a logic of magic with earlier understandings of
renunciation and ritual sacrifice. This might not be the true renunciation of the
ascetic, but it constitutes one of the main supports of a mythic worldview.
Mâyâ as Illusion
During the Upanishadic period a new meaning for the concept of mâyâ began to
be illustrated in Hindu mythology. That theme was the illusory nature of the
seemingly real. This theological and philosophical notion could have totally
undercut the assurances of Hindu mythology that attention to correct actions
(karma) would have positive results in this life and the next. But it did not. Para
doxically, mâyâ could be used as a new storytelling device as the succeeding
periods became more and more like Indian music. There was no actual musical
score, but only an essence that needed to be maintained. There was no single
account in which all the details had to be consistent, coherent, and logical, since
the myths pointed to a reality beyond, behind, above the illusion (mâyâ).
Metaphysically and epistemologically, mâyâ pointed to the process of men
tal creation and its correspondence to material creation. Like the mind-creations
of Brahmâ, this creation as projection by the Absolute (Brahman) seemed to
involve a dreamlike state of the Absolute in which the world was dreamed into
being. Later mythology picked up this notion explicitly, when Brahmâ or, more
properly, one of the supreme deities (Vishnu, S ́iva, Devî) was the dreamer and
creation was the dream. This critical usage of mâyâ as illusion or dream allowed
for a contradiction or rejection of the practical usages of mâyâ—performance of
ritual or austerities to acquire magical powers. Meditations to become one with
the One (the cosmogonic embrace) or devotions to the supreme deity (to receive
grace and love) allowed the cosmogonic problem of multiplicity and improper
order after creation to be finally corrected in oneness with the Supreme or with
the Absolute.
With the broad outlines of Hindu mythology’s approach to the cosmogonic
and cosmological mysteries of life sketched in, it is time to explore further a cen
tral problem in mythology: mythic time, space, and causality. That will be the
subject of chapter 2.

MYTHIC TIME, SPACE, AND CAUSALITY
W
hen Svâmî Vivekânanda (1863–1902) spoke of time (kâla), he con
nected it with the concepts of space (des ́a) and causality (nimitta),
in much the same way as centuries of Indian philosophers had done.
While the gods and goddesses were seen as being held within the operational
power of kâla-des ́a-nimitta, the Absolute would certainly not be. That would be
true for both the impersonal Absolute, Brahman, as well as the theistic supreme
deities, such as S ́iva, Vishnu, or Devî. Svâmî Vivekânanda’s handling of time as
relative to the Absolute and time limiting all creatures (those who are created)
is sufficiently representative of the interconnectedness of time, space, and
causality in most Hindu mythological periods to remind us that any division
between these three concepts is purely for purposes of convenience.
MYTHIC TIME
Mythic time provides a temporal plane that shapes all the cosmogonic elements
of Hindu mythology (associated with the origin of every thing and every being,
purpose, duties, stages of life, meaning, and so on) and turns mere stories into a
cosmic drama of necessity and urgency. One’s very actions (karma) are related,
even though they may be infinitesimal, to the greater stories of the transmigra
tion (both evolution and involution) of the cosmos.
Mythic time (cosmic, divine) and existential time (the time of ordinary
human experience) tend to interpenetrate each other in the living mythologies
of India. Human measurements of time—from the experience of divisions of
time in a day to those of a yearly (human) calendar—blend into the ritual cycle
commemorating divine birthdays and other festival events. However, a ritual
calendar pales when placed alongside a chart of mythic time. (See chart on p. 38.)
Birth and death are the normal markers for human or existential time. How
ever, mythic time intrudes, and birth must be viewed as rebirth. For in mythic
time, this birth or lifetime was preceded by the prior “causes” in the karmic
35



chain that shape this birth—always answering why one was born in this caste
(varna), into this marriage group (jati), with these disabilities, and so on. Since
one is now human, there would have been many, many lifetimes and rebirths as
animals and, prior to that, possibly as plants. There may even have been regres
sive rebirths, as was made clear in the myth of Kamsa and the six sons (referred
to in chapter 1 in the section on “Karma”; see also the entry on Kamsa in chap
ter 3). The mythic view of rebirth is cyclic—there is no moment that one can
declare as the absolute beginning of one’s own life cycle.
Quite telling is the fact that kâla is the word for both time and death. Kâla
was personified as the god (deva) of time, but he was also referred to as Yama,
the god of death. (See entries in Chapter 3.) Kâla worked within a fixed universe:
he would come only at the appointed time of death, which was governed not by
him but by a causality regulated by karma and the time believed to be allotted
for each species, from plants and animals to humans and gods. Even Brahmâ, the
creator, had a fixed allotment of one hundred divine years (see chart below).
In the Mahâbhârata (Anusasana Parva, chap. 91, verse 36) the sage Ganita
was given credit for calculating the course and duration of the yugas, the vast
cycles of time. The yugas were of extraordinary duration, but they were only
parts of even larger cycles—kalpas and mahâkalpas (defined below).
There is a way in which time could be said to have a beginning, for in most
later Hindu worldviews there was something outside of time that could begin
and end it. But, technically, these are re-beginnings. In the devotional (bhakti),
or theistic, systems a supreme deity ruled time, bringing it into being along with
Brahmâ, as in the myth cycle of Vishnu, where Brahmâ is born at the beginning
of each mahâkalpa. Also in the least mythological worldview, that of Advaita
Vedânta and its foremost philosopher-theologian S ́ankara (c. eighth century C.E.),
the Absolute (Brâhman) was both beyond and unaffected by kâla-des ́a-nimitta.
These cosmic principles subordinated both humans and gods to the rule of time,
putting them on essentially the same level in the myths.
Each beginning of time was a creation (srishthi)—or, as already observed, a
re-creation. Even the notion of revealed knowledge (veda) did not fully reconcile
the many revealed versions of creation found in the many Hindu scriptures (both
shruti and smritî, different orders of scriptures in their authority and origination).
There would be found in scripture creations from the mind (manas), and
creations by division, sacrifice, dismemberment, coition, and so on. The logical
contradictions were noted by early thinkers, but later resolved by the simple
device of stating that there were many creations, and these accounted for all of
the differences. There were minor creations (re-creations) after each set of the
four yugas (ages) and major creations after the mahâkalpas. (See chart on p. 38.)
A further notion removed one last discrepancy seen by some Hindu thinkers
36 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



the various Prajâpatis (creative “grandfathers”) had proliferated in the later
mythology so that even the notion of multiple creations did not remove all of
the logical problems. So the notion of gotras (families of created beings) placed
all of the creatures of each creation within four gothas, each “grandfathered” by
its own prajâpati. (But what seemed to fix the problems in the conception
seemed to disturb the fundamental insight concerning the interconnectedness of
all being as emanating from the One, as a projection from the One, and ulti
mately becoming one with the One.)
Mythic time had placed a judgment on this present moment in human or
existential time. In the present, human history is occurring at the worst of all
times, the mythic time of the kali-yuga (defined below), a time of lessened spir
itual possibilities because of loss of the full Vedas, and the inability to live the
Hindu way of life (the complete varna-as ́rama-dharma, the ethical system
involving the interrelationship of the individual and group’s obligations in every
aspect and stage of life). It further implied a current need for yet another restora
tion of the dharma, but with the likelihood that there would only be partial
incarnations of God (amsa-avatâras) before the final dissolution (pralaya) of this
kalpa and the coming of the tenth incarnation, Kalki (Kalkin), the last avatâra
of this yugic cycle.
Mythic time is complicated by a cross-referencing with periods of time
referring to Hindu scriptures. There is a notion that there was a time at the
beginning of this yugic cycle (in the krita-yuga, also called the satya-yuga, “age
of truth”) that was Vedic. That is, those who lived in the krita-yuga were able to
live the truths of the Vedas. However, by the kali-yuga human beings were in
need of simpler scriptures, representational aids to worship the divine (idols and
temples), and rules for living that were adjusted to a dark (benighted) age—thus,
the time governed by the devotional practices of the Purânas and consequently
called Purânic time.
The Mahâbhârata (Bhisma parva, 4–12 and Santi parva 12.224) and the
Manu Smritî (1.64–86) were among the first scriptures to record what later
became the prevailing view of mythic time. As mentioned before, the sage
Ganita was credited with making the first calculations that defined mythic or
divine time in terms of human time. Thus, the yugas, catur-yugas (the fourfold
yuga cycle), kalpas, mahâkalpas, days and nights of Brahmâ, and lifetime of
Brahmâ could be calculated in human years. (See chart on p. 38.) Yet there were
always variations in these calculations. The following chart is based on the
Vishnu Purâna, which saw time (kâla) as the body of Vishnu, the supreme cre
ator of all, including the time-space-causality continuum (kâla-des ́a-nimittâ).
Creation (srishthi) is followed by an active phase of evolution (sthiti) and
then of dissolution or involution (laya). At the end of one ardha-kalpa there is a

greater destruction of the cosmos (pralaya) followed by a great preservation
(prasrishthi) and its subquent destruction (pralaya). The period before and after
each yuga (sandhya and sandhyansa, respectively) are periods of awakening and
dissolution proportional to the time of the particular yuga. There are even
notions of time in terms of the lifetime of one Brahmâ—the great creation
(mahâprasrishti), the great evolution (mahâprasthiti), and the great destruction
(mahâpralaya). There is no ending, as this cycle starts over again. Also, accord
ing to the Vishnu Purâna there is no purpose to cyclic time either, as it is just
for the play (lîlâ) of Vishnu.
The list of words for mythical time is not exhaustive. Some of the myths
were quite creative and invented more units of time. For example, in the story
about Mahâvishnu incarnating as Varâha, Vishnu and Bhûmî-Devî made love for
a devavarsha—300 human years, less than one divine day.
Additional Systems and Units of Time
Astrological time (used to calculate horoscopes), calendar time (involving nam
ing the days after reigning planets, or graha, the solar months for the twelve
solar mansions, and the lunar months for the twenty-seven or twenty-eight
lunar mansions, or nakshatras), and musical and dance time all contributed to
the total culture’s conceptions and terminology about time. Of course, any myth
might introduce these notions of time into a story set in mythic time without
fear of inconsistency or contradiction.
DES ́A (SPACE)
In the Hindu continuum of kâla-des ́a-nimitta, space is the second component of
the cosmogonic mystery. Des ́a too must be created or brought into being and
order at each beginning, or re-beginning. What is the shape or dimensions of
space? What is above and what is below? Where is the center? Where do the gods
live? What are the names of the regions? Where does space go at the destruction?
The myths know and occasionally even ask these questions but never quite
answer them.
There were many conceptions of space during the various periods of Hindu
mythology. In the Vedic period there was a decidedly Indo-European three-tiered
universe with three hierarchical regions, as well as the notion of the cosmic egg
(Hiranyagarbha). The latter concept involves imagining space from “above” as
an egg enclosing existence, with the human beings within the egg looking up at
Mythic Time, Space, and Causality 39



its roof, the heavens, and being supported below, so that the enclosure was a
golden womb. This notion could be affirmed even as an hierarchical notion of
ascending regions or worlds (lokas) became the dominant conception.
The Vedic notion of space was limited to three regions: earth, midair, and
the heavens. A member of the principle divine triad of the Vedic period ruled
over each region—Agni over earth (bhû), Indra over midair (bhuvas), and Sûrya
over heaven (svar or svarga). Over time, these regions (lokas) were elaborated
until, in the Purânas, they had multiplied, with a loka for each of the major gods,
arranged hierarchically. Mount Meru (Mahâmeru, the cosmic mountain) began
with its base at the center of an earth island known as Jambudvîpa (rose-apple
tree island). Meru, or Mahâmeru, was shaped like a banyan tree, smaller at its
base and larger above. In the upper regions of Mount Meru were the regions for
the gods and their respective palaces (lokas). All had names—Brahmâloka,
Indraloka or Svarga, Vaikuntha (this name was also given to the watery realm
where Vishnu rested on the serpent Ananta, or S ́esha), Kailâsa (for S ́iva), Maho
daya (for Kubera), S ́raddhâvatî (for Varuna), and so on.
Jambudvîpa was either the island at the center of a series of concentric
islands or the first of seven donut-shaped islands with Meru at the center; in
either case, Meru was at its center. Each island had an ocean filled with a differ
ent liquid surrounding it (salt, sugar-cane juice, wine, ghee, buttermilk, milk,
and sweet water). Some sages and kings were said to have wandered until they
reached the Himâlayas and then finally Mount Meru. Others needed divine
transport to reach it. Not only could the occasional human reach Meru, but also
many other beings: animals (some divine like Hanuman and others who were
just companions or vehicles of the gods), semidivine beings (apsaras and gand
harvas), and demons—even armies of them could invade Meru.
Jambudvîpa was divided into many lands, with Bhârata (India) subdivided
into nine regions, each ruled over by descendants of the solar and lunar races of
kings. Bhârata was known for its sacred geography. Where gods and goddesses
had touched the soil of India in their births, play, or rule, it had been made
sacred. When there had been dismemberment of a god or goddess and divine
body parts had fallen to earth, those spots too were holy. (See the story of the dis
memberment of Satî after Daksha’s sacrifice in the entry on Satî in chapter 3.)
At such spots, mythic space and mundane geography overlapped at least at the
pilgrimage sites (tîrthas). All these places became sites for pilgrimage (tîrthas)
and for temples and temple-cities.
Sometimes what had been in divine or mythic space came down to earth.
The Gangâ was a celestial river, from which, according to some versions, S ́iva
only brought down one drop to make the mighty earthly Gangâ. A piece of
Mount Meru was broken off and made Lanka. Conversely, what was sacred space
40 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



on earth, such as a river, a tree, or a mountain, could have been a goddess in her
previous lifetime in heaven. Almost every river in India was mythically con
nected with a goddess who had been reborn as a river—sometimes a blessing,
sometimes a curse. Occasionally, a mortal was blessed to be reborn as a river
(and thus a goddess).
Below the earth were the nether regions or underworlds. The nâgas (snakes)
inhabited great rivers, the sea, and the primordial ocean, ruling over the treas
ures of the internal, or inner region, known as pâtâla. However, the nâgas were
also to be found in S ́iva’s heavenly realm, Kailâsa, and in other places like grave
yards in association with S ́iva.
The underworlds changed radically from period to period. As the kingdom
of Yama, lord of the dead, the underworld was named Yamapurî (city of death).
Yama and Kâla were the same god, and so space and time are one in death. The
Upanishadic lad Naciketas could report that the accommodations were fine and
the occupants well cared for in Yamapurî. However, subsequent rulers, all kings
of the asuras, turned the place into a living hell. Probably influenced by Buddhist
and Jain conceptions of hell, medieval Hindu mythology treated the seven
narakas (and some incorrectly added the Vedic netherworlds or pâtâlas) as
places of torment and punishment for evil deeds.
An alternate way of seeing the universe conceptualized space (des ́a) as con
sisting of eight spheres (sphere translating vasu, “that which surrounds”). These
spheres included the earthly sphere (prithivî), the spatial sphere (antariksha),
the heavenly sphere (dyaus), and the stellar sphere (nakshatra). In older mythol
ogy divinities (devas) both inhabited the various spheres and ruled them. Agni
ruled the earthly sphere, Vâyu (the wind) ruled the sphere of space, and Sûrya
(the sun) ruled the heavenly sphere. The constellations ruled the stellar sphere
(leading to their designations in the lunar and solar calendars). This notion of
des ́a contained within it faint memories of a mythological hierarchy that dif
fered from those mentioned in chapter 1, memories of a time when Vâyu was the
second member of the divine triad instead of Indra.
NIMITTA (CAUSALITY)
The last component of the cosmogonic puzzle in Hindu mythology was effective
causality. Most Hindus had held that the effective cause (nimitta) of the uni
verse would have to reside inside of the time-space-causality continuum. Thus,
time (kâla) and karma as the result of ritual or ethical actions could be con
trolled by the direct actions of the ritualist or by heroic effort as in yoga or ascet
icism (tapasya).
Mythic Time, Space, and Causality 41



If the gods (devas) were governed by karma, then they would be subordinate
to the forces of existence (or reality, consciousness, creation, or whatever one
might call it). Therefore, the law or laws of causality would be prior to the gods,
and a creator would only be like Brahmâ, a re-creator—existing within and gov
erned by time-space-causality.
The way causality was conceived of as governing within the universe, the
way the laws of karma operated, did not remain the same over the centuries.
Causality was not always seen as tight; it could be hard or soft. When causality
was seen as tight, that meant that the universe was seen as following rules of
causality that could not be changed under any circumstances. There would be
no miracles. One could only reap what one had sowed. There could be no gain
or loss. There could be no favoritism, no cheating, no deceit. Karma had to be
tight, or hard, to be fair, just, equal.
A preponderance of evidence suggests that Brâhmanical ritualism (also
known as Brâhmanism) was based on a belief in a tight causality. If the priest had
the correct knowledge (jñâna) of the proper rituals and sacrifices (yâyus, yâgas,
yâjñas) and knew the correct formulas of address and praise for each god (deva),
and knew the sections of scripture (karma kanda) about Vedic ritualism that
dealt with this “science,” the laws that governed this tight causality, only then
could the priest (brâhmin) expect perfect success in obtaining from the devas
exactly what had been asked. In the next-to-last section of chapter 1, “Renunci
ation, Sacrifice, and Magic,” the connection is made between the control exer
cised over the gods in the sacrificial ritual and the control exercised by the
practice of austerities. Hindu myths on asceticism also implicitly used a concept
of tight causality to explain how demons (always the test case) could acquire
power over the gods, bring disorder once again to all of creation, and drive right
eousness (dharma) from the world. Ascetic myths that used this tight causality
believed so strongly in the superpowers (siddhis) to be gained by ascetic prac
tices that a S ́ankara had to come along and dismiss their ritual and ascetic “sci
ences” as mâyâ—changing the way this term was used forever. Moreover, after
S ́ankara, no one would think that mâyâ referred to a tight causality. S ́ankara had
turned their magical science (mâyâ) on its head and, through the “paradigm
shift” that he achieved, mâyâ would subsequently mean “illusion” or “projec
tion” (vivarta).
Hindu mythology could not work with S ́ankara’s concept of relative or illu
sory causality. Hindu myths about ascetic practice and ritual performance
needed a tight causality to provide the certainty needed for communal identity
and karmic hope, so Purânic mythology countered with a concept of theistic
causality. The world was not an illusion; there was a supreme deity in whom all
causality resided. What ritualists sought with their sacrifices and ascetics sought
42 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



with their renunciations, theistic Hindus could now achieve with devotional
practice. A supreme deity, who both ruled kâla-des ́a-nimitta and transcended it,
could provide unmerited grace (something their good karma had not fully
bought or earned) and liberation (moksha). The Supreme—be it Vishnu, S ́iva, or
Devî—could thus provide a soft karma, granting refuge in a community of those
who followed the eternal truths (sanâtana dharma) of the scriptures and who
lived according to the expectations of the stages of life (as ́ramas) and the obli
gations of the organic society (varna).
Hindu mythology, like Indian music, did not require a fully explained or
precise cosmology. It knew the essence of the musical piece and had learned to
enjoy great latitude in performance and theory. In fact, lack of variation would
be boring to Indian taste and sensibility. Nothing was discarded, and mythmak
ers could and can draw on it all, without worrying about consistency or inco
herence in their worldview.

CHARACTERS, THEMES, AND CONCEPTS
ÂDI
An asura (demon)
The demon Âdi was the son of Andhak, who had been killed by S ́iva. To gain
revenge, Âdi did austerities (tapas) with the sole purpose of receiving a boon
(vara) from Brahmâ, the creator. In due course Brahmâ granted him the vara, so
Âdi asked for invincibility in battle. But boons, especially to demons, are provi
sional, and may be invalidated by a flaw in the wording of the request. The literal
wording of Âdi’s request won for him invincibility only while in his asura form.
Not knowing this limitation and quite certain of his invincibility, Âdi went
to Kailâsa, S ́iva’s heavenly abode, to avenge this death of his father. Âdi first
changed into the form of a serpent. Since snakes are natural friends of S ́iva, who
is lord of all creatures, Âdi was allowed into S ́iva’s presence. But once inside
S ́iva’s palace, Âdi again changed his form to appear like S ́iva’s wife, Pârvatî. S ́iva
recognized the deceit and killed Âdi, who had lost the boon of immortality by
being in another form than his own.

ADITI
A devî (goddess), mother of the gods
There are few interesting myths to tell about Aditi, but her status and roles
change so remarkably that she illustrates the fluidity of Hindu myths. Her name
45



literally means eternity (free, boundless, infinity), so philosophically she is a per
sonification of time. Aditi slowly evolved as the prototype of the Great Mother,
Devî, or S ́aktî.
In the early Rigveda she was described as the mother of seven (and later
twelve) âdityas (children of Aditi), and was prayed to for protection. There are
prayers to her in this period asking her to give the Aryans children and cattle,
protection and forgiveness.
In the epics (the Mahâbhârata and the Râmâyana), Aditi is the wife of
Kas ́yapa, a progenitor or grandfather of creation. She is explicitly the mother of
Vishnu, the twelfth âditya. But Aditi’s earlier praise as Deva-mâtri (mother of
the gods) led to her highest role, in the early Purânas. The âdityas came to
include all the devas, so she became mother of the 330 million gods and god
desses who made up all the various classes of medieval polytheism. Her oppo
site, in both name and role, was Ditî (bound, finite). Ditî’s children were the
daityas (born of Ditî), who were also known as the asuras.
In the sectarian Vishnu Purâna, where Vishnu was the supreme god, Aditi
was only the mother of Vishnu’s dwarf incarnation (Vâmana). In the Matsya
Purâna she was given a small part: she received a pair of earrings from Indra at
the churning of the ocean.
In the Vedas Aditi was the wife of Daksha, grandfather of all creatures. But
in the Vishnu Purâna Aditi had become the daughter of Daksha and wife of
Kas ́yapa. Her role as the parent of the gods was continued into her rebirth as the
mother of an incarnation of Vishnu. According to the Devî Bhâgavata, Aditi was
reincarnated as Devakî, the mother of Krishna.
All the variations did not go unnoticed. The great medieval commentator
Yâska explained that all these variations could be true because the gods were
born of each other. Another explanation accounted for differences in parentage
or marriage by saying that these were the results of rebirths, not just in this age
but in the many ages (yugas), with varying roles in each.

ÂDITYAS
Devas (gods)
The sons born to Kas ́yapa-prajâpati (a grandfather or procreator) and Aditi (mother
of the gods) are called the âdityas. In the hymns of the Rigveda, Aditi only had
seven or eight children. But by the time of the Brâhmanas there are twelve
âdityas: Dhâtâ, Mitra, Aryaman, Rudra, Varuna, Sûrya, Bhaga, Vivasvân, Pusha,
Savita, Tvashta, and Vishnu. They are among the most important of the earliest
46 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Vedic gods. This grouping could represent the twelve months, as they are celestial
deities. In another context âditya (singular not plural) referred to the sun (Sûrya).
But as the centuries passed Aditi’s role as mother expanded to all of the
devas. First, she became mother of Indra, who was called the king of the gods in
later mythology. The next addition to the myths spoke of twenty-one children
(besides the twelve) who were also called âdityas. And finally, as a prototype of
the Great Mother, Aditi became the mother of the entire world of devas, who
have become 330 million, all born from the 33 children of Aditi.
In the earliest stage of their conception, the âdityas seem to have been per
sonifications of light and of the phenomena of the heavens. The seven âdityas
were the sun, moon, and five planets. They were rulers of the celestial realm and
symbols of kingship and sovereignty, especially Varuna, Mitra, and Aryaman.
But their importance must have been developed in myths prior to the Aryans’
arrival in India (or for those who find the Aryans a transformation of local tribes,
before the composition of the hymns of India’s earliest literature, the Rigveda).
Their myths are not retold in the Rigveda, and their supreme importance receded
rapidly. Three more brother gods—Bhaga (the dispenser), Amsa (the share), and
Daksha (the capability, “ritual skill”)—were celestial models for the social and
ritual relationships of the earliest Aryans. But their myths were also not to be
found in the Rigveda, as the âdityas were in the process of being replaced by the
Vedic fire ritual (the Agni cult) and the Rigvedic triad of Agni, Indra, and Sûrya.
The myths of the seven âdityas can be found in Old Persia (Iran) in the form
of their equivalents among the Persian gods (Amesha Spentas) of the Avesta.

AGASTYA, AGASTI
A rishi (sage) who conquered the Vindhya mountains
Agasti was mentioned in a hymn in the Rigveda dedicated to Mitra, a solar deity.
That hymn said that two of the âdityas, Mitra (comradeship) and Varuna (binder,
“all-seeing”), placed their semen in a pot and set it before Urvas ́ î, an unusually
beautiful apsara (celestial maiden). Because she had aroused their desires, Mitra
and Varuna cursed Urvas ́ î to live on earth as the wife of the rishi Purûravas.
Agasti (or Agastya) and Vasishtha were the sons born to her. Later versions
expanded and elaborated on the details.
Agastya was the form of his name used in later myths. It was said that his
name came from his command that the Vindhya mountains bow down and wor
ship him. He received another name of Ocean Drinker (Samudra-Culuka) when
he drank up the ocean to reveal the demons hiding there and aid the gods in a
victory over them.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 47



According to the Purânas Agastya happened upon his ancestors’ spirits
(pitris) hanging upside down on a limb. They told him that they were in this
condition because the proper death rituals were not being performed and that
he must bear a son to carry out his duties to his ancestors. So he created a baby
girl from all the beautiful parts of the beings of the forest and placed her in the
king’s palace. And when she was of marriageable age, he asked the king to give
her to him in marriage. So he married Lopâmudrâ. He lived with her in a her
mitage south of the Vindhya mountains. The myths about him include stories
of how he ate the râkshasa (demon) Vâtâpi, how he stamped down the Vindhya
mountains, how he cursed the god Kubera, how he set the asuras on fire, how
he made Indra send rain, and many more. The râkshasas of South India were
said to be in fear of this great sage. Râma visited his hermitage, and Agastya
became his friend, advisor, and ally. He gave Râma the bow of Vishnu. And
when Râma returned to Ayodhyâ, Agastya joined him there as one of his
priestly advisors.
In the epics and Purânas Agastya was also celebrated as one of the greatest
writers of sacred literature. Agastya was said to have been an author of every
thing from Vedic hymns to texts on medicine, but it was as the father of Tamil
literature and science that he was most important in the south. There are tem
ples in modern Tamil Nadu in which Agastya worship is still practiced.

AGNI
A deva (god), god of fire
At his earliest appearance in the Rigveda, Agni was a complex deity. He was the
fire of the sacred sacrifices that were the heart of Vedic religion as well as the
central rituals of a seminomadic warrior culture. Agni was addressed as the deva
who ruled earth, a third of the entire cosmos. Two other gods with the charac
teristic of fire formed a triad with Agni. The solar fire (deified by many names,
especially that of Sûrya) was ruler of heaven; and the fire of the middle air, light
ning, was deified as Indra, god of storm and god of war. A few Rigvedic hymns
addressed Agni as one of the supreme triad (India’s first set of three), with Sûrya
and Indra. Agni was also the purifier of the offering to a Vedic pantheon and was
next to Indra in the number of hymns dedicated to him. (Later this function as
purifier of offerings was the only important role left for him.) Phrases from these
hymns suggest an Agni myth cycle and a separate cult. He was fathered by
Dyaus (sky) and the waters, or born of Indra between two clouds, had a triple
existence (in heaven, middle air, and earth), and was lord of the house, friend of
man, enemy of râkshasas (whom he crushes in his teeth), beloved of the hôtris
48 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



The Great Mother as Kali (TRIP)



(priests who make the Vedic sacrifices), and the one who knows when to make
the offerings that gain boons from the other gods.
S. M. Bhardwaj, in his study Hindu Places of Pilgrimage in India, uncovered a
connection between the Agni cult and the Aryanization of the regions eastward
along the Gangetic plain, north toward the Himalayas, and slowly south along the
coast but barely into the interior. Recorded in the Mahâbhârata, the world’s largest
myth about an ancient war, were the places sanctified by Agni that provided great
merit for those who visited and worshipped at these sacred sites (tîrthas). They had
become places to perform a fire ritual (i.e., they had been Aryanized). Thus Agni
seems to have been central in spreading Aryan (literally, “noble”) culture from its
beginnings in northeast India throughout the subcontinent.
In the Atharvaveda, Agni takes the soul of the deceased from the funeral
pyre to one of the worlds (lokas) of heaven (svarga), Indraloka or Brahmaloka, or
to hell (naraka). Fortunately for Agni, later accounts give this function to Yama,
god of death.
There are many forces at work in Agni’s reduction over the centuries to a
minor deity. There was the attack from outside the Vedic tradition by Buddhists
and Jains on the Vedic triad and its sacrificial system. The Agni cult included the
killing and eating of animals. One of the responses inside the Vedic tradition was
to begin to internalize sacrifice, and another was to adopt the principle of
ahimsa (noninjury, or literally “no murder”). In addition, later devotional Hindu
traditions that championed minor Vedic gods like Vishnu or non-Vedic gods and
goddesses like S ́iva and Devî had a more subtle effect on Agni’s role. As these
divinities rose to supreme importance, Agni became a messenger to the gods and
one of the eight guardians of the universe (ashtha-dikpâlakas).
Finally, in the Purânas, Agni becomes the name of a class of gods; his sons
and grandsons were also Agnis. In the medieval period Agni had a scripture
named after him, the Agni Purâna, as he became merely the recipient of a reve
lation from the rest of the devas. This scripture is a vast collection dealing with
the incarnations of Vishnu, injunctions relating to the worship of gods, and a
variety of subjects such as astrology, architecture, sculpture, and drama. In the
scripture, Agni himself was completely overshadowed by Vishnu, who is pre
sented as the supreme lord of the universe.
The Holi Festival (a two-day holiday at the end of winter in February or
March) is connected to Agni. According to one version of the myth that explains
the connection, he had been cursed by a sage (and great sages and yogis could
become more powerful than the gods by practicing austerities, tapas). This brâh
min was named Bhrigu. He worshipped Agni every day, feeding him with ghee
(clarified butter). While Bhrigu took his morning bath, he would leave his beau
tiful wife Puloma under Agni’s care and protection. But the asuras (demons)
50 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



came one morning while Bhrigu was away and fed Agni so much ghee that he
fell asleep. And they promptly stole Puloma. Bhrigu became so angry that he
cursed Agni so that he began to die. Vishnu was able to get the old sage to mod
ify his curse, but once a sage’s curse had been made it could not be taken back.
So now, only on the day before Holi are worthless offerings thrown into the fire.
On Holi Agni again receives his due—and is saved by divine grace. Another ver
sion has Ganes ́a, the elephant-headed son of S ́iva, taking pity on Agni and fan
ning his flames back to life with his ears.
In the Kathikai Festival in Andra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, S ́iva is wor
shipped in the form of the five elements, including Agni (fire). Another Shaivite
festival worshipping S ́iva as lord of the elements (i.e., the universe) is the Bate
sar Mela at the ancient pilgrimage site of Bhuteshwar. It is quite likely that this
was originally a pilgrimage site (tîrtha) of the ancient Agni cult.
Agni was given a role in many Purânic myths: in the birth of S ́iva’s son
Skanda, in numerous battles with the asuras, as a dart emanating from S ́iva, and
in the chorus of gods pleading their many cases with Brahmâ, Vishnu, or S ́iva.
But none of these roles indicated any memory of Agni in his glory in Vedic India.
Early verbal descriptions gave Agni two heads, four horns, three feet, and
seven arms. Centuries later Agni was sculpted in stone or carved in wood with
one or two heads, two or three eyes, and two or four hands. He was given a char
iot drawn by four parrots or was shown riding his animal vehicle, the ram. These
images included a wife, Svâhâ.

AHALYÂ
The first woman; one of the five perfect women
The story of Ahalyâ has as many dimensions as it has versions. She appeared in
the epic Râmâyana but was also projected back to the beginning of the creation
of this age (yuga). One account stated that Brahmâ created her as the first and
most beautiful woman on earth. Then he gave her to the rishi (sage) Gautama.
In most tellings, the rest of her story illustrated how a perfect woman should
behave under the worst of circumstances. The villain was Indra, the Vedic god,
reduced in the Râmâyana to a minor but despicable role. In one version Indra
changed his shape to appear to be Ahalyâ’s husband and deceived her. In another
he first changed into a rooster, crowed to make Gautama go outside for his
morning devotions, and then took his place in bed. Another version attempted
to mar her image, stating that Ahalyâ recognized Indra and was flattered by his
advances. When the rishi discovered Indra’s crime, he cursed him, at the same
time putting a curse on his wife that took away her beauty and expelled her into
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 51



the forest. After many years of austerities and purification she was found by Lord
Râma, rewarded for her devotion, and restored as chaste to her husband.
Ahalyâ was esteemed as one of the pañca-kanyâ, the five ideal women of
Hinduism, along with Draupadî, Mandodarî, Sîtâ, and Târâ.

AIRÂVATA
An elephant; the vehicle of Indra
Airâvata was the celestial elephant-king and the vehicle of Indra. Airâvata was
popularly known as the white elephant with wings. He was a descendant of the
lineage of the sage Kas ́yapa. Airâvata came from a maternal line (Kas ́yapa’s wife
Krodhâvasâ, their daughter Bhadramatâ, her daughter Irâvatî, and then Airâvata).
Such parentage would certainly explain how it was possible for Airâvata to be
born as king of the elephants. In mythic time gods might simply change into an
animal species with their spouses and have children of that species, or they
might spend a rebirth in an animal species. So the storyteller does not have to
say just how the descendant of a sage became an elephant.
Another version of the birth of Airâvata stated that he was born or appeared
out of the Churning of the Milky Ocean (Vishnu Purâna, chap. 22). But in this
account he had four tusks. Another Purâna, upon noticing the discrepancy,
added a new dimension—the story of an Airâvata with four tusks was about the
sixth cycle of creations (manvantaras), but this was the seventh. Each cycle had
its own Indra, with his elephant who was again named Airâvata.
Airâvata was used in another context as one of the eight elephants who
guarded the eight zones of the universe (ashtha-dikpâlakas). Airâvata protected
the eastern zone.

AMBARÎSHA
A king of the Ikshvaku dynasty
Ambarîsha, king of Ayodhyâ (birthplace of Râma), was one of the sixteen great
kings who ruled Bhârata (Marutta, Suhotra, Paurava, Sibi, Râma, Bhagîratha,
Dilipa, Mândhâta, Yayâti, Ambarîsha, Sasabindu, Gâyâ, Rantideva, Bharata,
Prithu, and Parasu-Râma).
In the Vâlmîki Râmâyana there was a story about the theft of one of
Ambarîsha’s sacrificial cows by Indra. (In the Bhâgavata Purâna the theft was
from King Hariscandra.) Ambarîsha was forced to find a proper sacrifice to com
plete his rituals. So he bought the second of three sons, named S ́unahs ́epha, of a
52 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



greedy brâhmin named Ricîka (also know as Ajîgartha). King Ambarîsha traded
100,000 ordinary cows for the sacrificial substitute—the young brâhmin
S ́unahs ́epha. But S ́unahs ́epha prayed to Indra, and Indra not only blessed him
with long life but also bestowed upon King Ambarîsha the rewards of the sacri
fice (yâjña) as if it had been properly completed.

AMRITA
Immortal; immortality; a drink or food
In the Vedas, amrita was a characteristic or quality of a suitable offering in the
fire sacrifices to the gods. Soma (the divine plant) had more amrita than other
offerings. Later amrita (or amritam) was a substance produced by the Churning
of the Milky Ocean (kshîrâbdhi-mathanam). There were different versions of
this myth in the Mahâbhârata, the Râmâyana, and the Purânas. According to
one version the demons (asuras) had triumphed over the gods (devas), so the
devas sought Lord Vishnu’s help. He told them about amrita and how it would
bestow immortality on those who drank it. Because the devas were able to take
all of the amrita with Vishnu’s help, they were able to prevail over the asuras.
In the Purânas there were many stories about the stealing of this ambrosia
of immortality. But amrita was no longer the sole source of immortality. Immor
tality was given by Brahmâ as the result of great austerities (tapas), but this was
only a provisional immortality—a guarantee of living as long as one’s allotted
time. In many of the later myths it was the asuras who did the difficult auster
ities and gained immortality, which was only a kind of limited invincibility, in
order to torment the gods.
Later mythology conflates amrita and soma as the drink of immortality.

ANANTA
A celestial snake
Ananta literally means “without end,” “infinite.” It was a descriptive term used
of Vishnu and other gods. It was also used as a name of Vishnu’s serpent.
Ananta was the giant serpent that floated upon the Milky Ocean and formed
the bed for Vishnu as he slept during the involution of the universe (pralaya).
Ananta (also known as S ́esha) was the son of Kas ́yâpa, the grandfather of all
beings, by his wife Kadrû. Other serpents, such as Vâsuki, Takshâka, and
Karkkotaka, were his brothers. Bala-Râma was a partial incarnation of Ananta.

ANASÛYÂ
A heroine and role model for women
Anasûyâ was the wife of the sage Atri. As with all major figures in later mythol
ogy, her lineage was completely spelled out: granddaughter of Svayambhuva
Manu (Manu of his Yuga) and his wife S ́atarupâ; daughter of Kardama-prajâpati
(progenitor of his age) and Devahutî.
Anasûyâ (charity) was famous for the power of her austerities (tapas). Once
Anasûyâ used her powers to bring rain when there had been a continuous
drought; even the Gangâ had dried up. Another time Anasûyâ changed ten days
into night to help the gods. And when Sîtâ was drawn by her austerities to the
forest hermitage of Anasûyâ and Atri, Anasûyâ was able to give Sîtâ an ointment
(created by austerities) that gave Sîtâ eternal beauty.
Anasûyâ played an important role in the story of Shîlâvatî’s curse, which
prevented the sun from rising. (See entry under Aruna.) The gods asked Anasûyâ
to help, so she convinced Shîlâvatî to remove her curse and allow the sun to rise.
Anasûyâ was given a boon, which she used to have sons born of the Trimûrti
(Brahmâ, Vishnu, and S ́iva). Anasûyâ thus became the mother of Dattâtreya,
Durvâsa (famed for both his psychic powers and his bad temper), and Candra.
Her sons were partial incarnations of Brahmâ, Vishnu, and S ́iva.

ANDHAK, ANDHAKA
An asura (demon)
In one version of his birth Andhaka was a daitya (demon), born of Ditî and
Kas ́yapa. He had a thousand arms, a thousand heads, and thus two thousand
eyes, hands, and feet (in another version, two thousand arms, two thousand
legs). And even though he could see, it was said that he walked like a blind man.
Andhaka means “blind” or “blind one.”
In another version Andhaka was born from the love play (lîlâ) of Pârvatî
with her husband, Lord S ́iva. Pârvatî placed her hands over S ́iva’s eyes in jest,
only to throw the universe into total darkness. But her touch heated S ́iva so that
a drop of sweat fell from his brow and became an angry, deformed, dark, hairy
demon, Andhaka. Pârvatî and her attendants were told by S ́iva to protect “her
son” and care for him.
On earth the demon Hiranyanetra (the golden eye) was practicing severe
austerities (tapas) to win a boon from S ́iva. And eventually the lord of yoga (S ́iva)
was pleased and granted Hiranyanetra’s wish for a heroic son. S ́iva gave his own
son, Andhaka, to the demon yogi.
In the Kûrma Purâna, Andhaka desired the beautiful goddess, Pârvatî, and
54 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



went to Mount Mandara to abduct her. S ́iva had gone to the Pine Forest to man
ifest himself there to its sages. He had left the gods, Vishnu and the rest, to
attend to and protect Pârvatî. The attendant gods became women in order to
serve the empress of the universe. But when Andhaka (who in this myth may not
be seen as being already Pârvatî’s son) attempted to molest her, S ́iva appeared
and impaled him on his trident and began to dance. But by the mere touch of
S ́iva, Andhaka’s sins were burned away. S ́iva transformed this grotesque demon
into a handsome young man. And when Andhaka prostrated before Pârvatî and
S ́iva, he was accepted as their son.

ANGIRAS
A Sage
Angiras appeared in many roles, some contradictory. The Rigveda called him the
first of the fire-gods. As such he was a mediator between gods and men. At times
he appeared as a mahârishi, a composer of many Rigvedic hymns to the gods. He
was also a prajâpati, or progenitor of humankind. As such his origin or lineage
was important, at least for later mythology. He was said to be born from the mind
of Brahmâ, as were five other sages: Marîci, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
There was a quite different version of his birth. Once Brahmâ went to see a
sacrifice performed by Rudra. He was attracted by the celestial damsels present
there and had a seminal release. He offered the semen to the sacrificial fire, and
from that fire were born three sages: Angiras, Marîci, and Bhrigu. The meaning
of Angiras is “one born from the fire.”
When Angiras was considered one of the sixteen grandfathers (prajâpatis), it
was by the appointment of Brahmâ. Angiras had two wives, Smritî and Khyati,
and fifteen children, in one account, and four wives in another: Smritî (memory),
S ́raddhâ (faith), Svadhâ (oblation), and Satî (truth). The famous sage Brihaspati
was his son.
Late myths tell of the great austerities (tapas) of Angiras that so frightened
Indra. Indra’s throne became overheated by these tapas, increasing his anxiety.
Indra had to act to stop these austerities, which could result in Angiras usurping
his rule of heaven. One version had Indra being reborn on earth as the son of
Angiras, by the name of Savyâ, to frustrate Angiras’s austerities.

ANI-MÂNDAVYA
A sage
Mândavya was a sage who was doing penance at his hermitage (ashram) when sev
eral thieves ran past being chased by the king’s men. The thieves left the stolen
property near Mândavya and ran away. The king’s men found Mândavya with the
stolen property and took him before the king. Since he did not answer the ques
tions put to him, Mândavya was condemned to death—along with the thieves,
who were finally caught. They were all pierced through with a trident. The thieves
died, but Mândavya stayed alive. After some time S ́iva appeared before him and
granted him long life. The king learned that Mândavya was still alive, made fur
ther inquiries, and realized that Mândavya was innocent. He asked Mândavya to
forgive him. Mândavya did so, even though it was not possible to take the trident
completely out of his body. The tip (ani) of the trident was left. And thenceforth
Mândavya came to be known as Ani-Mândavya (Mândavya with the tip).
Ani-Mândavya asked the gods why he had to undergo this punishment, even
though he had committed no sin. The god Dharma (Dharma-deva) answered that
Mândavya in his childhood used to pierce butterflies on broomsticks. Being
pierced with the trident was punishment for that sin. Ani-Mândavya argued
that, according to the scriptures, sins done before the age of twelve would not be
punished. So Ani-Mândavya laid a curse on Dharma-deva to be reborn as the son
of a lower-caste,  ́sûdra woman. And so it was; Dharma-deva was born as Vidura,
the son of the palace maid and the sage Vyâsa. There is another version of this
myth in which both cursed each other to be born of s ́ûdra mothers in their next
rebirth.
As in the Jewish story of Job, Ani-Mândavya, who had been a just man and
fulfilled his dharma (duty, righteousness), was betrayed by the divine, personi
fied as Dharma-deva. The story of Ani-Mândavya in the Purânas is but one
example of a strong protest against institutionalized duty.

ANJANÂ
A monkey; mother of Hanuman
Once S ́iva and Pârvatî were playing in the woods in the form of monkeys. Pâr
vatî became pregnant. The fetus was given to Vâyu, the wind god. Vâyu gave it
in turn to Anjanâ who was doing austerities (tapas) at that time in order to
obtain a son. Thus, Kuñjara, the monkey chieftain, and Añjanâ gave birth to
Hanuman.
In her previous birth Anjanâ was a goddess named Puñjikastalâ (also known
as Mânagarvâ). She was born as a she-monkey, Anjanâ, as a result of a curse. She

was redeemed from the curse and regained her original nature after the birth of

APÂLÂ
A daughter of the sage Atri
A story in the Rigveda says that Apâlâ was abandoned by her husband when she
came down with leprosy. She began living in the ashram of her father Atri and
did austerities (tapas) to please Indra. One day when she was coming back from
her daily rituals beside the river, she happened to taste soma (amrita) that was
to be offered to Indra. Perhaps she could be healed by this magical ambrosia of
the gods, or she could even gain immortality. But when Indra appeared, she
immediately gave the soma offering to him. Indra was so pleased by Apâlâ’s
action that he cured her of leprosy.

APSARA
A celestial being
An apsara was a celestial damsel or nymph (devastrî) found in Indra’s heaven,
Devaloka. Apsaras were born at the Churning of the Milky Ocean. Another ver
sion, in the Manu Shastra, stated that these damsels were created along with the
seven Manus. They were called wives of the gods and daughters of pleasure.
The thirteen apsaras were also said to have come from the union of Kas ́yâpa
and Arishtâ. The apsaras were known as heavenly charmers (as was Urvas ́ î) of
heroes and temptresses (as were Menakâ and Rambhâ) of sages. Their numbers
swelled from 13 to 34 to 1,000 and finally to 35 million. Their roles changed
from celestials in Indra’s court to wives of the gandharvas (celestial musicians)
to the reward for warrior-heroes in Indra’s heaven.

Her story was a warning to kings who abused their power, who did not live by

A haughty young king named Danda ruled a large kingdom that extended to
the Himâlayas. One day on a hunting expedition King Danda saw Arâ, daughter
of the great sage, Mahârishi S ́ukra. In his lust he raped the young brâhmin girl.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 57



Arâ told her father, and he advised her to practice austerities (tapas). This
must have been for purification, for it was the rishi (sage) who gained the boon
from Indra to rain fire upon the kingdom of Danda. The entire region was turned
into an impenetrable wasteland where neither animals nor birds lived. The place
became known as Danda-kâranya. (This story was nested within the Râma myth
cycle, serving to explain the place and its name.)

ARAYANNA
The heavenly swans (hamsa)
The arayanna were described as having a heavenly abode on Mânasasaras, one
of the Himâlayas. Ara denoted royalty. The swans did not like rain, so they came
to earth when it rained in their heavenly abode and returned as soon as rain
began on earth. Their parentage was traced to Kas ́yâpa by his wife Tâmrâ
through her daughter Dhritarâshthrî. Vâlmîki’s Râmâyana stated that this line
age alone gave the swan its divinity (devatva).
Swans were at first black and white, according to a myth in the Uttara
Râmâyana, but pure white was given as a blessing from the god Varuna, who
took their form to hide from the great demon Râvana. (The gods had assembled
for a sacrificial meal and had to change into the shape of various birds when
Ravâna came to attack them.) The swan was blessed by Varuna to be as white as
milk.
There are many stories about the arayanna. A swan was once stuck in a
water tank, and Prince Nala found and captured it, but then took pity on the
trembling bird and released it. The arayanna was so happy that it flew to the next
kingdom and helped in gaining Princess Damayantî as Nala’s wife.
The swan could be used in a more obvious moral lesson. A story was told to
Bhîshma: why this sage is so unreliable. An old arayanna lived by the sea and
preached righteous actions to the birds of that region. Then because of a famine
the birds needed to look farther away for their prey, so they entrusted their eggs
to the swan, and he grew fat eating the very eggs he had promised to watch.
Finally one of the birds noticed the declining number of eggs and told the oth
ers, and they killed the deceitful arayanna. This theme of reversal in the
myths—of a king or priest or even a god failing to be righteous—illustrated the
importance of following dharma (ethical duty) just as clearly as if the story had
given a positive example.
Swans (hamsa or arayanna) were considered to be celestial birds having the
capability of separating water and milk. They were often used in Vedantic liter
ature metaphysically as a metaphor for one who had the ability to distinguish

ARISHTÂ
Wife of Sage Kasyapa
Arishtâ is one of the mothers of all beings. She gave birth to the four gandharvas

A demon
Arishtha was the servant of Kamsa and was sent to Gokula in the form of an ox
to kill S ́rî Krishna. The ox terrified the cowherds (gopis) as it tore up the hills
and mountains around Vrindarvin. The youth Krishna faced and killed the ox,
throwing it an incredible distance. As he died, Arishtha appeared in his asura

ARJUNA
A hero and warrior
Arjuna’s story was one of the best known in Hindu mythology, yet it is fully
intelligible only if one is familiar with the many other stories related to it. It is
nested in or overlaps with the story of the great Bharata war, the story of
Krishna, the story of Krishna’s mother, Kuntî, and with the other larger stories,
many of which are told in the Bhagavad Gîtâ and the Mahâbhârata.
Kuntî received a mantra (magical formula) from the sage Durvâsa as a five
fold boon so that she could become the mother of a son from any deva she
thought about as she chanted the mantra. Before marriage she tried one of its five
uses and gave birth to Karna by the sun god Sûrya. But Kuntî abandoned Karna,
and he was raised by a low-caste family without knowledge of his miraculous
birth. After marriage, with the permission of her sick husband Pandu, Kuntî used
the boon three times and gave birth to three more sons: Dharmaputra (or Yud
hishthira) from Yama (god of death), Bhîma from Vâyu (wind god), and Arjuna
from Indra (king of the gods and god of war). She gave the fifth use of the mantra
to Mâdrî, the other wife of her husband. Mâdrî thought upon the As ́vins as she

chanted and gave birth to twins, Nakula and Sahadeva. These five sons became
know as the five sons of Pandu (the Pandavas). In the Devî Bhâgavata Arjuna is
said to be the reincarnation of the rishi called Nara. But this twist in the story is
not part of the narrative in the Mahâbhârata.
Arjuna, his brothers, and their one hundred cousins, who were known col
lectively as the Kauravas, received training in archery from the great master
(acarya) Drona. Arjuna surpassed everyone except the dark-skinned and low
caste Karna, Arjuna’s unknown half-brother. Karna later became allied with and
the champion of the Kauravas, who had become the enemies of the Pandavas.
Three episodes about Arjuna stand out of the hundreds nested in the Mahâb
hârata: Arjuna’s marriage to Draupadî, the loss of the kingdom to the Kauravas,
and the single episode told in the Bhagavad Gîtâ.
Arjuna won the hand of the princess Draupadî in an archery tournament,
and when he announced to his mother that he had won a great prize, she
declared that the prize must be shared equally with his brothers as always. Obe
diently, Draupadî married all five brothers, but Arjuna was her favorite. The
brothers agreed that none could intrude upon the brother who was alone with
Draupadî on pain of a one-year exile of celibacy. By mistake Arjuna broke the
agreement and went into exile. But he did not remain celibate and married three
more times. The most interesting of these was the marriage to his cousin
Krishna’s sister, Subhadrâ. She bore him a son whom they named Abhimanyu,
who died on the plains of Kurukshetra in the great war. This exile was the begin
ning of the epic relationship between Arjuna and his cousin Krishna. Together
they destroyed the Khândava Forest to appease the god of fire (Agni), riding on
two chariots as “the two Krishnas.” A nested story told how they were the seers
Nara and Nârâyana in a previous life. Nara has his own myth as the cosmic man,
or the original soul (purusha). Nârâyana would metaphysically connect Krishna
with the cosmic form of Vishnu. This warrior pair joined again for the greatest
of all battles on the fields of Kurukshetra, with Krishna as Arjuna’s charioteer,
the two Krishnas in one chariot.
The great war had so many causes that the storytellers nested one myth
inside another to create the world’s longest epic, the Mahâbhârata. At the same
time the theme was simple and understandable. The Pandavas had been cheated
out of their kingdom by the evil of their cousins, the Kauravas. The eldest Pan
dava, Yudhishthira, lost everything including Draupadî in Indian literature’s
most notorious dice game. Draupadî would have been stripped naked in the great
hall had not divine intervention provided an infinite amount of material to her
sari. This humiliation of their joint wife would be avenged. Now all the Pan
davas were exiled from their kingdom.
Arjuna used the time of this exile to further prepare as a warrior. He per
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 61



formed severe austerities (tapas) to S ́iva and was granted use of the doomsday
weapon (a divine bow and missiles that destroyed his enemies). He was even
transported to heaven and taught by his father, Indra, god of war. Arjuna became
a celibate dance instructor—an episode that associated him with S ́iva, who was
lord of the dance. Later in the great war Arjuna danced on his chariot and saw
S ́iva as the real agent of the destruction before him.
Arjuna’s most famous moment, one of the most loved in Hindu mythology,
was a single episode in the great war, the episode described in the Bhagavad
Gîtâ. Arjuna had lost heart as a warrior and questioned whether he should ful
fill his duty (dharma) as a warrior. He refused to continue a fight that would
mean killing of family and friends and incurring sin. Krishna argued with little
success until he appeared in his true nature as the supreme lord of the universe
as Vishnu. Arjuna was taught that he must do his duty, he must act without
attachment to results, and he must offer all the fruits of his actions to the divine
in loving devotion. Thus even in killing he would be free of sin.
Arjuna’s belated recognition of the charioteer Krishna as Vishnu, the
supreme lord of the universe, earned for him a place in Vaishnava mythology as
the role model for all true devotees (bhaktas). But Arjuna transcended any nar
row sectarianism. He became a pan-Indian example of one who does their caste
duty (varna-dharma). He fought for a just and righteous society based on the
rules of the Hindu tradition. He was an ideal husband, whose karma (in the
sense of previous actions) earned a marriage with the Goddess in her incarnated
form as Draupadî. He was the ideal human, connected to the divine as son of
Indra, as pupil of S ́iva, and as the friend of Krishna, the incarnation (avatâra) of
Vishnu.

ARUNA
Charioteer of Sûrya
Aruna’s story must begin with an account of how he became the charioteer of
the sun god, Sûrya. Aruna’s father was the famous Kas ́yâpa-prajâpati (grandfather
of all creatures). Two of Kas ́yâpa’s wives, Vinatâ and Kadrû, pleased him so
much that he granted each a boon. Kadrû asked for a thousand nâga (snake) sons,
and Vinatâ wanted only two sons, more powerful than those of Kadrû. So
Kas ́yâpa granted their wishes and went to the forest to practice austerities
(tapas). After some time Kadrû gave birth to a thousand eggs and placed them in
pots to incubate. Vinatâ gave birth to two eggs and placed each in a pot. After
five hundred years Kadrû’s pots broke open with her thousand nâga sons. So
62 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Vinatâ opened one of her pots, but that son was only half developed. This
deformed child was named Aruna. He became the charioteer of Sûrya (the sun).
His brother finally developed and was named Garuda, the great sun eagle, and
was eventually chosen as the vehicle of Vishnu. (There are some accounts that
say that Garuda’s mother was Kardu.)
In the Râmâyana, Aruna appeared in an episode with Râma and his brother
Lakshmana. Jatâyu, a bird hero, was wounded by the demon king Ravâna as he
escaped with Sîtâ. Ravâna gained victory by cutting off Jatâyu’s wings. When
Râma and Lakshmana found him wounded in the forest, Jatâyu explained that
he had been Aruna in his previous birth. In another version Jatâyu was only the
son of Aruna.
Aruna was used in a Purânic myth to account for the birth of Bâli (a
demon)—a tale of sex changes and deception. This episode was nested in the
story of Shîlâvatî, who had performed tapas to prevent the sun (Sûrya) from ris
ing, in order to save her husband. And while the sun slept, the sun’s charioteer
Aruna used his time off to change into a female and go to Indra’s heaven, Deval
oka. He had learned that the women were dancing naked in their reserved area.
But as he sported with them, Aruna, in his female form as Ârunîdevî, excited
Indra—an Indra who had become the example of desire and excess in the Purânic
myths. Indra enjoyed the night with Ârunîdevî, and they had a child, who was
immediately given to Ahalyâdevî, wife of the sage Gautama. Of course this
introduced the need for another story to be told about what happened to this
child and how it became Bâli. But Aruna’s story continued. He had to return to
his job as charioteer of the sun. Shîlâvatî had stopped her tapas, Sûrya had awak
ened and was ready to be driven across the heavens in his chariot, but Aruna was
late getting back. Sûrya made him explain the reason for this dereliction of duty,
and Aruna told how he had changed himself into a woman and deceived the
women in Indra’s heaven and been caught by Indra—and with what result. Now
the sun—whose purity was never questioned in the Vedas but who had also
become in later myth an example of how not to behave—reacted. Sûrya made
Aruna show his female form, and of course Sûrya too had a child by Aruna; this
child was also turned over to Ahalyâdevî, wife of the sage Gautama. This child
was named Sugrîva. And this story continued when Indra gave both Bâli and Su
grîva to the monkey king, Riksha-râja.

ASHTHÂVAKRA
A sage
Sage Uddalaka’s daughter Sujatâ married his disciple Khagodara, and to them
was born Ashthâvakra. The word ashtha-avakra means “one with eight bends,”
referring to his deformed body.
There are two versions of how he acquired the eight bends. According to one
version, once Khagodara was reciting holy mantras. Sujatâ sat beside him, but
the baby inside her womb heard his father’s chants and said loudly that Khago
dara was chanting the mantras in the wrong way. Khagodara became very angry
and cursed him to be born with a crooked body.
Another Purânic version stated that Devala was Ashthâvakra’s original
name, and that he was the son of the sage Asita. In this version Devala was
cursed by Rambhâ, one of the celestial nymphs (apsaras). She had fallen in love
with Devala, but when Devala did not yield to her wishes, she cursed him with
a crooked body. He thereafter was called Ashthâvakra. He later regained his orig
inal form by doing tapas (austerities).
The Agni Purâna added that once Ashthâvakra laid a curse on the celestial
nymphs (apsaras) when they teased him about his crooked body, dooming them
to be reborn on earth as humans, and thus the celestial nymphs were reborn as
the many wives of Shrî Krishna.

AS ́IKNÎ
Wife of a prajâpati and mother of many beings
As ́iknî must be ranked among the most fertile of all wives in Hindu myth. The
myths only gave her this one dimension. Daksha, an alternative creator to
Kas ́yâpa, found that he could not create all of the species from his own mind. So
he married As ́iknî and immediately begat five thousand Haryashvas, creatures
who were to populate the earth naturally. But the old sage Nârada, the deva-rishi
(divine sage) with the golden words, shamed the Haryashvas with their igno
rance. He told them that they must first know the extent of the world before
they peopled it. So they left to explore the world and never returned. Finally
Daksha concluded his Haryashva sons were lost, so he fathered a thousand
S ́abalâs ́va sons by As ́iknî. But dear old Nârada tricked them with the same quest,
and they followed their brothers to the ends of the world, not to come back. This
time Daksha begat sixty girls by Asiknâ, and he gave them to lesser prajâpatis
(grandfathers of the various species). And this worked.

ÂSTIKA
A sage; son of the sage Jaratkâru and his wife, the goddess Manasâ-devî
This Purânic myth illustrates how many steps might be involved in a divine
plan. Long ago snakes were overrunning the earth, so everyone pleaded with
Kas ́yâpa-prajâpati, the great progenitor, for protection. Kas ́yâpa created a goddess
from his mind, and she was appropriately named Manasâ (mind). While she was
practicing tapas (austerities) in the forest to gain a boon from S ́iva, a sage named
Jaratkâru discovered a reason why he must give up his celibate life and marry.
He discovered the spirits of his ancestors in a very sad state, hanging upside
down on a single blade of grass over a precipice. When asked, they told him that
it was because he had no children for the annual rites (samskâras), and without
living descendants they would perish and never reach heaven. So the sage
decided he must marry and fulfill his duty (dharma) toward his ancestors.
Jaratkâru had only one condition: that the woman should have the same name
as his own.
This condition could be met, because Manasâ incarnated as the sister of
Vâsuki, the great serpent, in order to save the serpents, who were threatened
with total extinction by a soon-to-be-undertaken snake sacrifice, foreknown by
her tapas.
Vâsuki, the great serpent, appeared to tell the sage Jaratkâru that he had
such a sister (or half-sister as it turned out to be). So Jaratkâru and Jaratkâru were
married. And all was bliss until the sage Jaratkâru overslept in the lap of his wife,
who was supposed to wake him up to do his rituals. He cursed her for not awak
ing him. But she thought of the gods, and so great was the power from her aus
terities that they appeared immediately. They were finally able to convince the
brâhmin that he should not exile his wife before she had a son. So he touched
her with his hand, and she became pregnant with Âstika. In many accounts, he
then retired to the forest.
So Manasâ-devî (in her incarnation as Jaratkâru) traveled to Kailâsa and was
instructed by S ́iva and Pârvatî. Her unborn child, Âstika, heard all the teachings.
He grew up being taught by gods and sages. Finally Âstika and his mother Man
asâ-devî went to visit Kas ́yapa, who was overjoyed to see his grandson and
daughter. Kas ́yapa passed the merit of feeding a million brâhmins to his grand
son. Now the stage was set for Âstika’s role in the divine plan.
A king named Parîkshit had insulted a brâhmin during his meditation by
throwing a dead snake on him. The sage’s son, S ́amîka, was offended by the joke
and put a death curse on King Parîkshit—that he had only seven days to live. But
the king had his engineers build a new palace on a pillar in the middle on the
ocean with psychics and yogis protecting him. The giant serpent Takshâka made
a final attempt on the seventh day. Disguised as an old priest, Takshâka met
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 65



Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods, on his way to protect the king. After
they became friends, Dhanvantari returned home. Takshâka changed his shape
and entered an apple being taken to King Parîkshit. When the king picked up the
apple, Takshâka changed into his true shape and size and killed Parîkshit
instantly. But the king’s son, Janamejaya, sought revenge. After all the proper rit
uals were carried out, the new king Janamejaya enlisted many brâhmins, who
began a snake sacrifice. So many snakes were called into the fire by their pow
erful chants (mantras) that Takshâka fled to Indra and curled himself around
Indra’s bed. But the brâhmins increased their chanting and used even more pow
erful mantras and were about to bring Takshâka, the cot, and Indra into the fire.
So the gods rushed to Manasâ-devî and asked her protection of the surviving
snakes and Indra. Manasâ-devî sent her son Âstika. Âstika knew that a king
must grant a brâhmin a reasonable request. So Âstika asked King Janamejaya to
give him the lives of Takshâka and Indra as a gift. His advisors saw no way out
of this request, so the king gave Âstika his wish, and the snake sacrifice was
ended. All the requests for divine help, all the way back to the people of the
world praying to Kas ́yapa to protect them from the snakes, were fulfilled. But the
snakes were also protected from annihilation.

ASURA
Demons
The term asura is so ancient that it has a separate mythology among the Aryans’
cousins in ancient Persia. In the Avesta, the word ahura (asura, Sanskrit) was a
positive term that meant the gods. But the ahura were mainly gods of agrarian
values, and the greatest ahura was Varuna, the god of the justice in the sense of
cosmic order (rita) that a farmer could depend upon to reap what he had sowed.
The original meaning of the word asura was “spiritual, divine.”
Even in the Rigveda there was an admission that the asuras were the older
brothers of the devas, the gods of the Vedic, or Aryan, peoples. Varuna was the
only asura who was honored as a god in the Vedas. For the Aryans the asuras
except for Varuna—had become demons. It was not that they were really evil;
they just opposed the devas.
In the later mythology everyone had to have a genealogy; so the asuras
belonged to the dynasty of demons, sons of Kasyapa-prajâpati born to two of his
wives, Danu and Ditî. The sons born to Danu were called danavas, and those
born to Ditî were called daityas. The danavas and daityas together constituted
the class of demons, or asuras.

The râkshasas are another class of demons not included with asuras, as they
descended from Pulastya, not Kas ́yapa.

A ́SVA-MEDHA
The horse (as ́va) sacrifice (medha)
A wild stallion was released by a warrior king to roam freely. The king or his
general would follow the horse with an army and defeat in a battle any kingdom
that the horse crossed that would not pay tribute and recognize the king’s sov
ereignty. There was a chance for great honor, but only a “world conqueror”
(cakravartin) could complete such random warfare. At the end of the year the
horse would be brought back to the king’s capital, where priests would sacrifice
it in one of the most elaborate and expensive of Vedic rituals. The cost of the
as ́va-medha alone required much booty from the year of conquests. The ritual
had a number of features involving fertility and renewal.
Performing a hundred such sacrifices (yâgas) was the definition of an Indra.
Thus, later mythology taught the descent of royalty from the gods and their
upward rise back to divinity, even the status of king of the gods, an Indra.
A ́SVATTHÂMA, A ́SVATTHÂMÂ
A Kaurava general and a brâhmin
As ́vatthâma became the commander-in-chief of the Kauravas when their great
army had been reduced to three—plus the dying Duryodhana. Those three
entered the camp of the Pandavas and slaughtered many heroes and their chil
dren. Five young sons of the Pandavas were beheaded and taken back to Duryo
dhana. Draupadî, wife of the Pandava brothers, wanted revenge, but she allowed
her husbands a way out of slaying a brâhmin. They only had to bring back the
jewel As ́vatthâma wore. Bhîma, Arjuna, and Krishna pursued As ́vatthâma and
brought back his jewel to Draupadî. As ́vatthâma went into the forest with the
sage Vyâsa where they both are said to continue to live as ciranjivis (ones who
do not die).

ATIBALA
A samnyâsin (world renouncer)
Yama took the form of a samnyâsin and was the indirect cause for the death of
Râma and Lakshmana.
After Râma had killed Râvana in the Lanka war, the main reason for the
incarnation of Vishnu as Râma was fulfilled. There needed to be a cause for
Vishnu to return to Vaikuntha (his heavenly abode). Brahmâ asked Yama to go
to see Râma. Yama went to see Râma in the guise of a samnyâsin called Atibala
and said that he had a secret to tell Râma. During their meeting with him
nobody was to enter. Lakshmana was asked to guard the entrance, and if any
body entered Lakshmana would forfeit his life.
At that time sage Durvâsa approached Râma’s tent, after doing austerities
(tapas) for a thousand years. He was hungry and wanted to ask Râma for food.
When Lakshmana asked him to wait for a while, Durvâsa threatened to turn
everybody into ashes if he was not allowed to go inside. With no other alterna
tive Lakshmana had to go inside and inform Râma about the situation. Durvâsa
was given sumptuous food. But in order to keep the promise with Atibala, Lak
shmana had to die. He went to the river Sarayu and drowned himself. Beset by
despair, Râma entrusted the affairs of his kingdom to others and went to the
river Sarayu. There he renounced his earthly body and also drowned himself
returning to Vaikuntha in his original form of Lord Vishnu. (Another Purânic
version is given in the entry on Lakshmana.)

Brahmâ had six mânasâ-putras—sons created from his mind. Atri was one of

Kratu. Another version of the mânasâ-putras increased the number to seven, or
the seven sages (sapta-rishis).

Atri married Anasûyâ, and they had three sons, Soma (or Candra), Durvâsa,

AURVA
A fierce sage
The Aurva myth was told only in the Mahâbhârata and portrayed a time of
mutual killings between the ks ́atriyas and brâhmins. It took some of the motifs
of the Agni myth cycle, such as the submarine fire, and reshaped them, portray
ing the fiery priest Aurva, whose horse-headed descendants would consume the
world at the end of the age. The Aurva myth may have been a model for that of
the later Paras ́u-Râma incarnation in the Purânas.
A generous king named Kritavîrya made the priestly descendants of the sage
Bhrigu very rich. But with his death the kingdom and its ruling family fell on
hard times. They asked the Bhrigus for help but were refused and felt humili
ated. When they learned that some of the priests had hidden their wealth in the
ground, the impoverished ks ́atriyas vowed to kill them all. So a slaughter of the
Bhrigus (also called Bhargavas) began. Even women and children were killed.
One woman hid her unborn child in her thigh, but the ks ́atriyas learned of it. As
she fled from their pursuit, she fell, and her thigh split open. A boy too bright to
be looked at fell from her thigh (ûru), and thus he was called Aurva (of the thigh).
As he grew, his austerities (tapas) frightened both gods and men. After years of
wrath against the ks ́atriyas, only his ancestor spirits (pitris) were able to get him
to release his anger. When he threw it into the sea, it became a fiery being with
the face of a horse that was called Hayashiras (another name in the Vedas for the
sacrifice itself, yâjña).
Aurva retreated to the forest and while there stopped the satî (widow-burn
ing) of the pregnant wife of King Bâhu. She finally delivered, after carrying the
baby for seven years. Aurva became the child’s protector and named him Sagara
(ocean). Aurva gave him the fiery weapon of Agni, the Âgneyâstra, which later
helped Sagara conquer barbarian invaders. One account stated that Aurva had a
son named Ricîka. Another version stated that he begat progeny who began
destroying the world. Brahmâ had to intervene and gave an abode to them in the
“mouth of the ocean” so that together they could consume the world with fire

AVATÂRA
A concept meaning incarnation, or “coming down of god”
The term avatâra is usually associated with divine incarnations, especially the
ten incarnations of Vishnu. But there were lists with as many as twenty-six incar
nations. The ten avatâras, dashâvatâra (dasha, “ten,” and avatâra, “incarna
tions”), were Matsya the fish, Kûrma the turtle, Varâha the boar, Narasimha the
lion-man, Vâmana the brâhmacâri (second stage of life) dwarf, Paras ́u-Râma (or
Râma with the ax), Shrî Râma, Balabhadra-Râma, Krishna, and the future avatâra,
Kalki. The incarnation of Vishnu as Kalki is expected at the end of the Kali Yuga
when this evil age ends in fire. One account stated that there are an innumerable
number of the incarnations of Vishnu, both partial (amsâvatara) and full. In some
lists the Buddha was considered an incarnation of Vishnu, taking upon himself
the form of a false teacher in order to lead those who were evil away from the
Vedas. Traditionally, each avatâra appeared in order to perform a specific cosmic
duty that was necessary to maintain or restore cosmic order. Having performed
that task, the avatâra then disappeared, or merged back into Vishnu.
The myths of each of the avatâras will be told under its own heading, but
those of Râma and Krishna need further attention. These deities became so pop
ular that they transcended their regional origins. As early as medieval Hinduism,
each began to be seen as a deity in his own right, and indeed as the supreme lord
of the universe, not just an incarnation of Vishnu. This change also involved a
reversal. Since either Râma or Krishna was the Supreme, then Vishnu, and all
other gods for that matter, were but manifestations of Râma or Krishna.
The myths about the Divine Mother, Devî (Durgâ), and S ́iva also involved
the notion of divine descents (avatâra). But there were subtle differences in the
philosophical and theological concepts of S ́âktism (worship of the Divine
Mother) and Shaivism (worship of S ́iva). Both maintained philosophically that
the Absolute did not come down into the limitations of time, space, and causal
ity. The Absolute remained beyond these limitations, while only a manifesta
tion, not technically an avatâra, appeared to reveal the truth or to correct what
only God could.
Krishna’s promise in the Bhagavad Gîtâ expressed the concept well:
In order to protect the good and punish the wicked,
In order to make a firm foundation for righteousness,

AYODHYÂ
A city
Ayodhyâ was the capital city of the kings of Ikshvaku. But it then became one
of the seven most sacred cities in India because it was the birthplace of King
Râma. Ayodhyâ was also where Râma ruled as king after he defeated Râvana.
Râmanavami is the festival that is still celebrated there, one of the five great
fasts (maha-vratas) of Vaishnavism.
Ayodhyâ has become a flash point for communal struggles in modern India
since a four-century-old mosque was destroyed by radical Hindus there. They
believed that it had been built over the very birthplace of Râma.

BALA
A demon (asura)
Bala lived in Atala (one of the seven hells), teaching ninety-six kinds of magic to
trouble the devas (divinities). Out of one of his own yawns, he created three
women with the power to entice whomever they wanted. These three women had
an aphrodisiac called hataka. They gave hataka to men and enjoyed them as long
as they liked—and then would abandon these poor mortals, drained of their energy.
In a battle with Indra, king of the devas, Bala defeated him. Indra “took
refuge in Bala” and glorified him with the highest praise. Bala fell into Indra’s trap
by asking Indra what were his wishes. Indra said that he wished for Bala’s body.
Bala then gave his body to Indra, because he had given a boon and would keep his
word. Bala’s body was cut into pieces and thrown about. Wherever these pieces
fell, they turned into gold mines (some accounts say diamond mines). This was
the result of Bala’s merit for honoring his promise to grant Indra’s request.
After the death of Bala his wife Prabhavatî went to the teacher of the asuras,
the âcârya  ́Sukra, in an attempt to bring her husband back to life.  ́Sukracharya said
that he was unable to do so but was able to bring back Bala’s voice. And it asked
Prabhavatî to leave her body and join him. Prabhavatî immediately abandoned her
body and joined Bala. She thus became the river Prabhavatî, for posterity.

BALA-RÂMA, BALARÂMA, BALABHADRA-RÂMA
Elder brother of Krishna and an avatâra of Vishnu
This myth is nested within the great myth cycles of Lord Vishnu and Shrî
Krishna. Bala-Râma was involved in many episodes as an adoring, supportive
older brother of Krishna. It was a role deserving of a divine lineage, demonstrat
ing the kind of person who deserved to be near so great an incarnation as
Krishna, and how important it is to live one’s own dharma (duty). Bala-Râma’s
birth was particularly miraculous.
On the day of the marriage of the Yâdava king Vasudeva to Devakî, a voice
was heard from the sky that the eighth child of this couple would kill Kamsa,
the wicked brother of Devakî. Kamsa immediately jailed both Devakî and
Vasudeva. He killed the first six children born to them. The seventh child was
the incarnation of Ananta, Vishnu’s serpent. Vishnu, in order to protect him,
ordered Mâyâdevî to take the child from the womb of Devakî and to place it in
the womb of Rohinî, another wife of King Vasudeva in the city of Madhurâ.
Rohinî gave birth to Balabhadra-Râma. The eighth child was Krishna.
Bala-Râma was the constant companion in all the boyhood adventures of

Vishnu. (TRIP)



Krishna in Madhurâ, killing demons and demonesses and even his uncle Kamsa
at a Câpa-pûjâ (worship of the bow).
According to the Bhâgavata Purâna, Bala-Râma was the partial incarnation
of Vishnu, and Shrî Krishna is a full incarnation. Other Purânas identified Bala
Râma as the incarnation of Ananta, the serpent on which Vishnu reclined upon
when floating on the milky ocean. In versions where Bala-Râma was considered
a partial incarnation, another figure was inserted in the list of the ten incarna
tions of Vishnu, such as Buddha. When Bala-Râma died of disappointment with
the Yâdava clan and all of their failures at kingship, his spirit left his body
through his mouth as a white serpent and was welcomed into the netherworld
by the Nâga kingdom.
In art and iconography Bala-Râma is exactly the same in appearance as
Krishna except he is white and Krishna is black or dark purple.

BALI
A king of the asuras
Bali was present at so many times and places that the mythmakers had to
employ one of their greatest discoveries, the various periods of the Manus (man
vantaras), a repeating of the cosmic ages each with its own “first man” (Manu).
Thus the stories of Bali and his deva (god) opponents were never in conflict.
Mahâbali (or “great” Bali) was present at the Churning of the Ocean in the
Câkshusa-manvantara, the period ruled by the Manu Câkshusa. He fought Indra
and the gods, constantly defeating them with the magic of mritansañjîvanî (life
restoration) taught by their great guru  ́Sukra. So complete were his victories over
the gods, that his priest  ́Sukra performed the sacrifice of vis ́vajita (conqueror of
the world), and Bali completed one hundred as ́va-medhas (horse sacrifices). (For
a description of an as ́va-medha see under “Yudhishthira.”) Bali was anointed as
king of heaven—he had become an Indra.
The asuras possessed amrita (the magical no-death nectar) and its container.
Once when Bali was killed in a battle with the gods, the demons carried his dead
body to their teacher  ́Sukra, and Bali was brought back to life. He completely
drove the gods from the heavens, but in his victory he denied both devas and
brâhmins (priests) their due. So with the help of the priests, the gods were finally
able to appease Lord Vishnu, who had been upset with their pretenses. They real
ized that Bali’s devotion to Vishnu was the reason for his triumph over the gods
and that it had been the ultimate reason for Bali’s invincibility. Only Vishnu
could contrive a plan that would both restore the devas’ rule over heaven, their
dharma, and reward his devotee Bali with a greater destiny.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 73



So Bali’s story folded into the more significant story of the incarnation of
Vishnu as Vâmana, the dwarf. In that incarnation, Vishnu defeated Bali by his
very devotion to Vishnu and confined Bali to Pâtâla (the netherworld, hell).
Some accounts gave the Bali myth a perfect bhakti (devotional) ending.
Vishnu incarnated as a small, some say dwarf, brâhmin who came to Bali and
was honored by him. Even when his own priest and advisor recognized Vishnu
and warned Bali, the king granted the young brâhmin a wish. And the wish—for
all that could be covered by his three steps—ended in Bali losing everything.
Some versions have Garuda, the sun eagle, binding Bali and taking him to Pâtâla.
Other versions had Vishnu rewarding Bali with a direct entrance into heaven.
There was one account that said that Bali became a ciranjivi (one who lived for
ever), just like Hanuman, the faithful servant of Râma.
Bali played a role in Vâlmîki’s Râmâyana in an encounter with the demon
Râvana. Râvana went to Pâtâla to free Bali but could not even obtain the earrings
of Bali’s great-grandfather, Hiranyakas ́ipu. Râvana returned to Lanka in shame.
In a myth featuring the goddess Lakshmî, Bali’s loss of his kingship of heaven
came from his neglect of service to the brâhmins.

BÂLI
A great monkey king
Bâli’s myth is nested within a number of interlocking myths. His part in the
story of Râma and Sîtâ is mostly negative, as Râma has to kill him. But this is
because he has turned from the very practices that made him a great king. He
had a divine birth, one of miracle and magic. And that birth was set in motion
by a woman sage of great power whose pronouncement stopped the sun from ris
ing.
Bâli was the son of Indra by Aruna, but Aruna was a male—the charioteer of
Sûrya. This was a late myth that highlighted the lust of Indra and devotion to
Râma as an incarnation of Vishnu. But before we can get to the gender-shifting
birth of Bâli and his brother, Sugrîva, there is another story of the events that set
this one in motion.
S ́îlavatî was a devoted wife and had acquired great power through her aus
terities. One night according to the wish of her leprous husband, Ugratapas,
S ́îlavatî carried him on her back to a harlot. On their way the sage Animandavya
saw them and cursed Ugratapas for his lust: he would die before sunrise. S ́îlavatî
heard this and cast a spell so that the sun would not rise the following day. And
the next day the sun did not rise at the right time, and the night was prolonged.
Because of the magic of S ́îlavatî, the sun continued to sleep. Aruna, the char
74 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



ioteer of the sun, seeing that the sun was not rising at his appointed time,
thought of spending this free time watching the dance of the apsaras in the court
of Indra. He went to Indra’s court disguised as a beautiful woman. But Indra
noticed and was attracted by this new woman. He took her to a remote place,
and out of their union was born Bâli. Aruna was late getting back to Sûrya, so
the sun was angrily waiting for him and demanded an explanation. When Aruna
told the whole story, Sûrya became interested in seeing this female form. Aruna
again became a woman for the sun and out of their union was born Sugrîva.
The brothers, Bâli and Sugrîva, were given to one of the most pious of
women, Ahalyâ, wife of the sage Gautama, and brought up in their hermitage.
Later the monkey king, Riksha-râja, prayed to Indra for sons, and Indra brought
him the divine brothers. Thus, Bâli, the elder, became the king of the monkey
tribe when Riksha-râja became too old to rule.
After some time Bâli learned that a monkey was born of S ́iva and Pârvatî,
and he feared for his kingdom. He tried to kill that monkey, Hanuman, before he
was born by pouring five molten metals into the womb of his foster mother,
Anjanâ. But since Hanuman was conceived of the sperm of S ́iva, he could not be
injured by heat or metal. And Hanuman’s presence protected his monkey
mother as well.
Bâli had been given a boon from the devas that he would receive half the
strength of his opponent in battle, thus enabling him to defeat anyone he
wanted. So his kingdom grew in every direction. The demon king of Lanka,
Râvana, was envious and devised a plan to kill Bâli. One morning as Bâli did his
rituals on the eastern seashore, Râvana quietly sat down behind him, planning
to attack from the rear and outwit the boon from the gods. Bâli pretended that
he did not notice Râvana but tied him up like a bunch of sticks with his long
tail. He jumped about India as usual on his way back to his kingdom. When
everyone saw the demon tied up by Bâli’s tail, he was laughed at and humiliated.
Râvana returned to Lanka in defeat.
There is an interesting story, an excursion into magic and deceit, to explain
how the two divine monkey brothers turned into blood enemies. The son of
Maya, a carpenter of the demons, sought to use his abilities in magic and
wrestling to defeat Bâli. But when he challenged Bâli in the middle of the night,
Bâli and his brother Sugrîva chased the magician into a cave. Bâli left Sugrîva at
the mouth of the cave with the command to seal it if red blood indicated he was
killed. And if the milk of a sorcerer appeared, it would mean that Bâli had suc
ceeded. But after a year blood appeared, and Sugrîva sealed the cave, returned to
the monkey kingdom, and was crowned king. But the sorcerer’s magic had
worked in spite of his death as his blood appeared red instead of white. Thus Bâli
believed that his brother had tried to kill him for the kingdom. Bâli would have
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 75



killed his brother, but Sugrîva took refuge on a mountain that Bâli could not go
to because of a sage’s curse that he would meet death there. So Bâli practiced rit
uals and austerities (tapas) on the seashores, jumping back to his kingdom in a
single bound after each attack. On his way, he would kick his brother on the for
bidden mountain in mid-flight. Hanuman was Sugrîva’s minister, and this tor
ture of his king troubled him. One day he leaped into the sky as Bâli jumped
from the sea toward the kingdom, kicking Sugrîva in passing. If Hanuman could
have pulled Bâli into the mountain, the touch of the mountain would have
ended his life and the torment of Sugrîva. But Hanuman and Bâli were equal in
strength and finally had to make a truce.
Finally, the stage has been set for Bâli to be a worthy opponent of Râma on
his march to Lanka to free Sîtâ. Râma met Sugrîva, and they became allies. Sug
rîva and his prime minister, Hanuman, were to help Râma attack Râvana, and
Râma was to help Sugrîva take back his own kidnapped wife from Bâli. But Bâli,
the son of Indra, had such great powers that none had been able to defeat him.
Sugrîva had two duels with him, losing half of his energy to Bâli each time, and
was near death. Finally Râma killed Bâli from his hiding place, robbing Râvana
of a powerful ally. As he died, Bâli questioned Râma’s honor as a warrior, saying
that it was not right for the king of Ayodhyâ to kill from ambush. In each ver
sion of the story, Râma’s answer was revised. Since he was the perfect king and
husband, and an incarnation of the supreme god, his answer needed to be satis
factory. But each version had attempted to solve a perceived weakness in his
character and his divinity. Râma had done what was needed: Bâli could not be
defeated in direct combat and needed to be punished for violating his dharma by
stealing Sugrîva’s wife. So Râma had killed him by the only method that was
available to him. But such a utilitarian justification of his actions was not an
ideal solution, which sought glorifications of dharma and honor.
After Bâli was killed by Shrî Râma, the kingdom was given to Sugrîva, and
Râma proceeded to Lanka to attack Râvana.

BHADRAKA
A sinful brâhmin
Bhadraka had lead such an immoral life that some accounts say that he was out
casted. But one day he took a ritual bath for three days at Prayâga, during the
month of Mâgha (a month in the Hindu calendar that falls in February or March).
It had been said that those who took a bath at Prayâga in the month of Mâgha
would be absolved of all their sins. So Bhadraka was awarded rebirth in heaven
after his death because of this single act.
76 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



This type of myth advertised the powers of a particular pilgrimage place. So
great were Bhadraka’s sins that everyone could believe that they had sinned less
and would surely get to heaven by taking a pilgrimage to Prayâga and bathing
there.
BHADRAKÂLÎ
An incarnation of Pârvatî
When S ́iva learned of his wife Satî’s self-immolation in the sacrificial fire of her
father Daksha, he loosened his matted hair in full anger. Out of this angry energy
were born two attendants: Vîrabhadra and Bhadrakâlî. Bhadrakâlî was the angry
energy of Pârvatî in a feminine form. S ́iva sent them to kill Daksha.
This part of the S ́iva myth cycle involves the killing of a brâhmin. Even S ́iva
could not do that directly. Devotees of Lord Vishnu used this myth to argue that
S ́iva was not invited to Daksha’s Vedic sacrifice because of his impurity and that
his killing of a brâhmin, even indirectly, by sending his creations, made him
guilty of the greatest sin against dharma (duty, righteousness).
In a later myth Bhadrakâlî made a dramatic appearance in the Krishna birth
story. In order for Krishna to escape death at his birth at the hands of his evil
uncle Kamsa, a baby girl was substituted. As Kamsa tried to kill her, Bhadrakâlî
appeared in full glory and power.
She also played a role in the Râma-Râvana war. Pârvatî complained to S ́iva
that she had not been given a role in Vishnu’s Râma incarnation. So S ́iva caused
her to lose consciousness of her true nature and be reborn as Lankâ-Lakshmî, a
doorkeeper or guardian in Lanka for Râvana. She fought with Hanuman, who
knocked her unconscious with a blow from his left hand. When she regained
consciousness, she remembered that she was Bhadrakâlî. She thanked Hanuman
and returned to Kailâsa and S ́iva.

BHAGA
A deva
Bhaga (inherited share) was a Vedic deity of wealth, power, and happiness. He
was also, according to the Rigveda, one of the seven âdityas. The other six are
Mitra (friendship, comradeship), Aryaman (honor, or chivalry), Varuna (binder to
tribal rules; “all-seeing”), Daksha (ritual skill, or rules of ritual), and Amsa (gods’
share).
Later, in the Mahâbhârata and the Purânas, there are twelve âdityas, born to
grandfather Kas ́yâpa-prajâpati and his wife Aditi. Bhaga was given a wife, Siddhi

(psychic power). He made brief appearances: in Indra’s assembly, at Arjuna’s
birthday celebration, at the burning of the Khândava forest, at Daksha’s sacrifice,
and at the sacrifice in which the devas forgot to give Rudra a share. In each of
the last two stories, Bhaga’s eyes were plucked out. At Daksha’s sacrifice Bhaga
was one of the presiding priests. After S ́iva’s anger over Satî’s suicide in her
father’s sacrificial fire was manifested as Vîrabhadra and Bhadra-kâlî, Vîrabhadra
plucked out Bhaga’s eyes. Another version had S ́iva doing it himself. This blind
ness was later seen as appropriate to Bhaga’s way of bestowing wealth—without
regard to purity, devotion, or honor. Bhaga bestowed wealth blindly.
In one account that did not become universal, Bhaga was associated with
Rudra (a fierce god appropriated by the S ́iva myth cycle) and gave his name to
eleven Rudras. This association with Rudra came from a role Bhaga played in the
myth that told of the dividing up of the sacrifice among the devas at the end of
the deva yuga. Rudra was left out and in a rage attacked the gods, causing great
injury. Bhaga was blinded. Another version had Rudra giving back Bhaga’s eyes
as well as the body parts taken from other gods. Some accounts would have S ́iva
returning these items.
But the point about wealth being given blindly was lost in the episode of
dividing up the sacrifice, while it remained intact in the myth about Vîrab
hadra’s blinding Bhaga at Diksha’s sacrifice.

BHAGAVAD GÎTÂ, BHAGAVADGÎTÂ
A scripture
The Bhagavad Gîtâ (Song of the Lord) is one of the most loved scriptures of
India. It is pan-Indian, even though its central character, Arjuna, discovered that
the driver of his war chariot, Krishna, was the supreme lord of the universe, Lord
Vishnu. If this claim were taken literally and exclusively, the Bhagavad Gîtâ
would be limited to devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnavites, or Vaishnavas). But many
interpreted Krishna’s revelation of the Godhead metaphysically: he was, accord
ing to them, speaking of the vastness of the divine and Vishnu as only one of its
manifestations. Because of the sheer beauty of this poem the Bhagavad Gîtâ has
become the song (the Gîtâ) of all songs.
The Gîtâ was been added as an appendix to the great epic, the Mahâbhârata.
The presence of the Gîtâ in the epic meant that the myth cycles of both Krishna
and Vishnu included a recognition that Krishna was a full incarnation of Vishnu.
The story of the Gîtâ occupied but a moment in the great Kurukshetra bat
tle between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, nested within both the larger story
of the battle and a story about a sage telepathically seeing and hearing what was

happening many miles away and telling it to the blind king. Krishna was
attempting to convince Arjuna to continue fighting as a warrior in order to
uphold dharma, the sacred order of life. Arjuna could only see the sin of killing
his kinsmen in a war that seemed selfish and cruel. He even questioned the
activity of war itself.
Except for the revelation of his true nature as Vishnu, Krishna’s story was
that of a charioteer in the Mahâbhârata. But the Gîtâ provided support for the
central claim of the Krishna cult—that Krishna was the Supreme. Krishna’s
divine birth and childhood are not found in the Gîtâ but in the Purânas, espe
cially the Bhâgavata Purâna. Krishna’s myth cycle was nested within Vishnu’s,
since he was the eighth avatâra (incarnation) of Vishnu.
The Bhagavad Gîtâ received so much praise from around the world after its
early-eighteenth-century translations into English and German that Indians dis
covered its pan-Indian character. Svâmî Vivekânanda’s (1863–1902) praise of the
Gîtâ as the “gospel of Hinduism” raised it to a rank almost equal to the Vedas
in holiness and example.

There are many excellent translations in English since the first, in 1885. One that

(New York: Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, 1968). A fine scholarly translation is
by Kees Bolle, The Bhagavadgîtâ (Berkeley: University of California Press,
1979). Almost every major thinker in India has written a commentary on the
Gîtâ, many of which have been translated into English.
BHÂGAVATA PURÂNA
A scripture
The Bhâgavata Purâna is a highly devotional scripture that articulated the views
of tenth-century South India and of those worshippers of Krishna known as the
Bhagavatas. It is quite large, even by Indian standards, containing 18,000 verses
(slokas), in twelve books (skandhas) of 332 chapters. All the incarnations of
Vishnu are described, but the tenth skandha is a masterpiece on the divine
Krishna. The Bhâgavata Purâna should be given as a gift on the full moon day
of Proshthapada (September), along with an image of a golden-colored lion.

BHAGAVATÎ
The goddess
Bhagavatî (feminine form of “lord”) is another name for Devî, or S ́haktî; when it
elevated the goddess to the role of the Supreme, it became a term used by her
sect, the S ́âktas. In the Devî Bhâgavata Purâna the mother of the universe, Devî,
taught Vishnu about the eternal reality of time, space, and the universe (brah
mânda). The name Bhagavatî could be interchangeable with Prakriti (nature),
indicating the eternal and all-powerful. The S ́âktas taught that everything is
grounded in the energy (s ́aktî) of the mother and by her all things exist. Such an
understanding would be considered sectarian, but Bhagavatî may also be used as
a nonsectarian name for Devî.

BHAGÎRATHA
An ascetic king
Bhagîratha’s story is part of the myth of the coming to earth of the Gangâ
(Ganges). These interlocking stories gave Bhagîratha a great royal lineage, with
prior events in that lineage requiring him to do a thousand years of austerities
(tapas) in order to ask S ́iva for a boon. And all this explained the coming down
to earth of the Gangâ.
Bhagîratha’s great-grandfather, Sagara, had two wives and sons from each.
All 60,000 sons of one wife were killed by the sage Kapila as they disturbed his
rituals. Indra had stolen the sacrificial horse that King Sagara had been using in
the battle before the as ́va-medha (royal horse sacrifice) and hid it near Kapila’s
place for rituals. The warriors’ noise, upon their discovery of its hiding place,
ended their lives. But a proper burial was not possible for lack of water, so nei
ther Bhagîratha’s grandfather or father could complete their duty. In order to
obtain enough water Bhagîratha worshipped the celestial river goddess Gangâ.
She appeared and told him that her descent to earth would destroy it in a world
wide flood. Gangâ told Bhagîratha to ask Lord S ́iva’s help. So to get S ́iva’s atten
tion, Bhagîratha did austerities (tapas) for a thousand years, and S ́iva allowed the
river to fall on his head and go through his matted hair. After another thousand
years none had reached the earth. So Bhagîratha worshipped S ́iva fervently, and
S ́iva shook a single drop of the celestial Gangâ from his own matted hair. That
became the mighty earthly Gangâ with sufficient water for Bhagîratha to com
plete the burial rites of his ancestors.

BHAIRAVA
An attendant of  ́Siva
Bhairava (the terrible) is a popular Tântric deity—of the type scholars like Wendy
Doniger classify as hot, or nonorthodox. Once, overcome by pride, Brahmâ the
creator insulted S ́iva. Out of the fire of S ́iva’s anger Bhairava was born. Instantly
Bhairava rushed at Brahmâ and pinched off the fifth, or crowning, head of
Brahmâ. S ́iva turned Bhairava into the damanaka, or tâtirî tree. But S ́iva was
technically guilty of taking the life of a brâhmin (brahmahatyâ) by cutting off
one of Brahmâ’s heads. So in expiation of that sin, he—some say S ́iva, others say
Bhairava—had to become a begging ascetic carrying a skull (Brahmâ’s fifth head).
Some accounts gave Bhairava a self-created female assistant for his journeys,
named Brahma-hatyâ. (These versions point to left-handed Tântric practices that
require a female assistant.)
At last Bhairava—some accounts say on the suggestion of S ́iva—went to
Vârânasî (modern Benares) and took a bath in the Gangâ. This washed away his
sin. He left the fifth head of Brahmâ there, and that place became a famous pil
grimage place named Kapâla-mochana-tîrtha (skull-liberating ford). The Kapâ
likas copied S ́iva’s austerities as naked ascetics devoted to Bhairava, carrying a
skull as their begging bowl. Bhairava’s sacred tree (the damanaka, or tâtirî) is still
worshipped because of its association with S ́iva as Bhairava.
Iconographically, Bhairava is horrific, adorned with snakes and symbols of
S ́iva, such as a crescent moon and matted hair. His weapons are the sword,
arrow, bow, dagger, trident, and rope. He can have five faces and is often clothed,
if at all, in an elephant skin.

BHAIRAVÎ
A manifestation of Devî
The Bhairavî is “the horrific one,” a “hot,” as scholars say, or nonorthodox, form
of Devî and a counterpart of Bhairava.
She was also one of a very ancient group of eight Ambâs, or Mâtrikas (moth
ers), who were non-Vedic and identified with the feminine energies of great gods
(Brahmânî from Brahmâ, Mahes ́varâ from S ́iva, and so on). The seven other
Ambâs were Rudrârcikâ, Rudracandî, Nateshvarî, Mahâlakshmî, Siddhacâ
mundikâ, Siddhayoeshvarî, and Rûpavidyâ. The count increased until the
Ambâs, or Mâtrikas, were beyond number. They can also be shown as worship
ping S ́iva and attending his son Kârttikeya.

BHAKTI
A religious practice of worship
Most Hindu mythologies are built upon a logic of devotion (bhakti), connecting
worship (puja), purity (shuddhi; s ́auca), morality (dharma), responsibility
(karma), and austerities (tapas). Bhakti can be more than just “being religious,”
since it can lead to liberation (moksha) from life’s addictions and even from the
cycle of rebirth (samsâra). This sense of liberation is often connected to an after
life with a personal supreme god, such as S ́iva, Vishnu, or Devî. It has always
involved a loving relationship with the divine. Some myths are told from the
perspective of bhakti.
Indian philosophers and theologians began at least by the time of the Bha
gavad Gîtâ to classify religious or spiritual experience according to three or four
types, which are called ways (margas) or disciplines (yogas). Bhakti appears in
both lists. Devotionalism is the way (marga) or practice (yoga) known as bhakti
marga or bhakti yoga.
Bhakti encompassed worship, prayers, and both elaborate and simple devo
tional rituals. But myths were not always linked to religious practice. Some
times, devotion was a strategy of praise that was performed in order to gain
power, a blessing, or a boon. What was gained by this kind of praise would then
be used by the “hero” to complete his or her “quest,” or “pilgrimage.” This use
of bhakti in these myths would be more a part of a world of magic or shaman
ism than of devotional spiritual practices.

BHARADVÂJA
A sage
Bharadvâja was the son of Mahârishi Atri. He lived thousands of years, years that
he used for the study of the Vedas. He was a disciple of the great Vâlmîki. Many
Vedic hymns are credited to Bharadvâja’s authorship.
When Râma was beginning his exile, he went to Bharadvâja’s as ́rama and
was blessed by him. Later when the great king Bharata visited with a huge ret
inue, Bharadvâja used his powers as a magician and called the architect of the
gods,Vis ́vakarman, to arrange a banquet, with dishes of food floating down from
heaven and entertainment by some of the most famous celestials—devas, gand
harvas, apsaras, and ashthadikpâlas.
82 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



During the time when Vishnu was incarnate as Krishna, Bharadvâja had a
momentary liaison with the great temptress, Ghritâcî. This famous apsara gave
Bharadvâja a brâhmin-warrior son, Drona. Drona was the great archery master
of the Bhârata war, training both Pandavas and Kauravas.

BHARATA
A brother of Râma
There were five Bharatas in Hindu mythology: (1) the brother of Râma, (2) a par
tial incarnation of Vishnu who ruled for 27,000 years and whose land was called
Bhârata, (3) a king of Hima who reigned for 100,000 years and, according to one
tale in the Bhâgavata Purâna, was the king from whom India received its name,
(4) a sage and writer of the Nâtyas ́âstra (art of theater), and (5) a late collective
term for the sons of Agni, god of fire.
Bharata, son of Das ́aratha and brother of Râma, was interesting from a num
ber of points of view. There were so many twists and turns in this myth that a
skillful teller could find something for almost any occasion—from positive
examples of loyalty and duty to negative ones of deceit and jealousy.
King Das ́aratha of Ayodhyâ had no children, so he performed the putra
kameshti (the ritual to beget children) on the advice of the sage Rishyas ́ringa.
From the sacrificial fire emerged a pot of pudding (some accounts say the very
ambrosia of the gods, amrita). The pudding was equally divided between his
three wives: Kausalyâ, Kaikeyî, and Sumithrâ. S ́rî Râma was born to Kausalyâ,
Bharata to Kaikeyî, and Lakshmana and S ́atrughna to Sumithrâ. The four sons
married well, and arrangements proceeded for Râma to succeed his father. But
Das ́aratha’s second wife, Kaikeyî, had two boons from the old king that she had
not used. So she used these to force him to exile Râma to the forest for fourteen
years and crown her son, Bharata, king. Râma, his wife Sîtâ, and his brother Lak
shmana went without complaint to the forest. But even before Bharata returned
from a visit to be crowned, the old king died of remorse at what he had been
forced to do by his evil wife Kaikeyî. Bharata was so furious with his mother that
he would have killed her had his half-brother S ́atrughna not prevented it. Bharata
and Shatrughna then set out to find Râma and get him to come back to the king
dom. A huge procession from Ayodhyâ followed them to the banks of the Gangâ.
At Râma’s forest as ́rama the brothers completed funeral rites for their father but
were unable to get Râma to return as king. Râma believed that it was his duty
(dharma) to fulfill his promise to his father. So Bharata took Râma’s sandals
back to Ayodhyâ to symbolize that he was ruling for his brother until Râma
returned after the fourteen-year exile. Bharata left the palace vacant and ruled
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 83



from a village near the capital. After fourteen years Râma returned and was
crowned king of Ayodhyâ.
Bharata was sent by King Râma on a mission to kill gandharvas who were
molesting people in Kekaya, a nearby region. When he had freed these regions
of demons, his two sons were made their rulers. Bharata’s final act of loyalty
and devotion to his divine brother was to give up his life when Râma drowned
himself in the Sarayû River. S ́atrughna committed suicide as well. When Râma
became Vishnu again, Bharata and S ́atrughna became Vishnu’s conch and
wheel.

BHÎMA
One of the Pandava brothers, a hero of the Mahâbhârata War
Bhîma (the terrible) was the product of his mother’s union with Vâyu, the wind
god. (For more details see Kuntî.) Bhîma had a terrible temper but was coura
geous and a great warrior. He was the Pandava brother with the most strength
and appetite. He would eat half of the family’s food. During the first exile from
the Pandavas’ lost kingdom, Bhîma saved the family from a burning house and
subdued asuras (demons) to stop them from molesting humankind. After defeat
ing the demon Hidimbha, Bhîma married the demon’s sister Hidimbî as his sec
ond wife. Bhîma enjoyed a memorable honeymoon of a year, aided by Hidimbî’s
magical ability to fly to the mountain tops. So by day Bhîma honeymooned with
Hidimbî, and each night he returned to be with the Pandava brother’s joint wife
Draupadî.
Bhîma had vowed to avenge the humiliation of Draupadî caused by Duryo
dhana. He finally kept that vow on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. However,
Bhîma had to resort to an unfair blow from his war club, which crushed his
cousin’s thigh, and then he kicked his despised foe brutally as he lay wounded.
His brothers had to pull him away. That blow earned him the title of an unfair
fighter, a blot on his honor as a warrior.
Despite one episode that tarnished his record, more than a hundred stories
made Bhîma an example of raw courage and strength, fighting to follow the way
of a righteous warrior.
After the end of the Mahâbhârata war, he followed his elder brother Yud

hishthira on the final journey to Kailâsa (heaven). Nevertheless, he died on the
way and was waiting for Yudhishthira when he finally got there.

BHRIGU
A sage, son of Brahmâ
There are many versions of Bhrigu’s birth. Depending on the account, Bhrigu
was born as one of the mahârishis or as a demon (asura). One account said that
he was the son of Brahmâ, born of Agni at a sacrifice (Brahma-yâjña) presided
over by Varuna as the chief priest (hotri). In yet another Bhrigu was born from
Brahmâ’s skin. And still another account said that he was born of Manu and then
sired the greatest of sages and rishis, the class of Bhârgavas, called the Bhrigu
vams ́a (Bhrigu’s family). Nevertheless, he was one of the grandfathers (Prajâ
patis) of a minor class of gods, the Bhrigus, with a family from each of his births,
and he started at least two different family lines, one from Brahmâ and a second
from Varuna.
Bhrigu was the officiating priest (hotri) at Daksha’s sacrificial feast, to
which S ́iva was not invited. Sîtâ cast herself into the sacrificial fire because of
the humiliation she felt that her husband was not invited, which implied that
he was not worthy to attend. In anger S ́iva produced two demons who avenged
the loss of his wife—either pulling out the beard of Bhrigu or, according to
another account, killing all the officiating priests, including Bhrigu.
Bhrigu was used often in the Purânas in myths about psychic powers and
the curses that sages would put upon evil kings and demons. Bhrigu’s most
famous action was his curse of S ́iva, whom Bhrigu condemned to be worshipped
as a linga (a phallus). S ́iva had killed Bhrigu’s wife Puloma to end her ascetic
practices (tapas) in support of the demons. In Bhrigu’s mouth was put an anti
Shaivite proclamation: that no one who was pious or respectable would ever
worship S ́iva—only S ́iva’s linga.

BHÛMÎ
The goddess of earth
Bhûmî (the earth) was a Purânic addition to the Hindu pantheon. There are a
number of versions of her birth, and her children had so many different gods and
demons as fathers that another myth had to provide a curse from Pârvatî to
explain this flaw in her character.
Some of the versions of Bhûmî’s birth in the Purânas involved a physical
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 85



earth that then became a goddess. But in others she is the daughter of Brahmâ.
In one version of the first kind, during the period of floods, the earth was in a liq
uid state. S ́iva cut his thigh and let a drop of blood fall into the waters. It coagu
lated as an egg (anda), which S ́iva split open. Man (purusha, the cosmic man)
emerged, and from him was made nature (prakriti). One half of the eggshell
became the sky and the other the earth. In another such version, in the begin
ning Mahâvishnu lay on the surface of the waters. A lotus sprang from his navel,
and on its blossom sat Brahmâ. From Vishnu’s earwax was born two demons
who tried to harm Brahmâ, so Vishnu killed them. The demons’ fat hardened
into the earth.
Another myth began in the Varâha Kalpa (the age of Vishnu’s incarnation
as a boar), with the demon Hiranyâksha abducting Bhûmî and taking her under
the waters. However Vishnu took the form of a boar and brought Bhûmî to the
surface on his tusks. Bhûmî stood up on a lotus leaf on the surface of the waters
in her most charming shape. Vishnu was so overcome by her beauty that he
made love with her for one Deva-varsha (a god’s moment of three hundred
human years). Mangala was born from this contact. From that time Bhûmî-devî
became Vishnu’s wife.
Nevertheless, it was assumed by many of the myths that, if the demon
Hiranyâksha abducted her, she would have become his “wife.” These accounts
stated that the mere touch of his tusk made Bhûmî the mother of the sage
Naraka and, therefore, the mother of the asuras (rather than Ditî). Therefore, she
was referred to as the wife of Hiranyâksha. Her marriages to Vishnu and to
Hiranyâksha with children from each was explained by a curse from Pârvatî. It
was said in the Vâlmîki Râmâyana that Pârvatî and S ́iva’s love play rocked the
foundations of the heavens and the earth, so both the gods and Bhûmî com
plained to S ́iva. He stopped, but Pârvatî became angry. She cursed Bhûmî-devî
that she would become many forms and the wife of many. Pârvatî also stated
that, since she had been prevented from having a son, Bhûmî-devî would have
no more children.
In various Purânas Bhûmî received a number of minor roles. Bhûmî-devî
was turned into a cow and milked dry by the magic of the sage Prithu. She
appeared in the Narasimha myth to catch Prahlâda, the demon devotee of
Vishnu, when Prahlâda was thrown from a high building by his father
Hiranyakas ́ipu. And Bhûmî got Paras ́u-Râma to stop killing ks ́atriyas before all
were eliminated from the earth during that incarnation of Vishnu. Finally, in
Vishnu’s incarnation as Râma, Sîtâ was Bhûmî’s daughter. It was to her that Sîtâ
returned when life with Râma became unbearable.

BRAHMÂ
A deva (god)
Brahmâ rose to importance in the late Vedic period of the Âranyakas and Upan
ishads, after the first Hindu triad declined—that of Sûrya, Indra, and Agni.
Brahmâ’s temple at Pushkara was the beginning point for pilgrimages from the
time of the two great epics. However, it turned out to be the only temple dedi
cated to Brahmâ as the primary deity that has survived the centuries. His cult
may have once been important enough to command the respect of pilgrims, but
he was badly used in most of the later myths. Even though Brahmâ has had roles
in more myths than any other god or goddess, his parts have left him flat and
one-dimensional.
In the Brâhmanas he was associated with Prajâpati and later replaced him
as the creator. His creations, however, came to be seen as re-creations. It was
S ́iva, Vishnu, or Devî who was said to be the ultimate origin of the universe.
Brahmâ was only its current creator (or re-creator).
In his many myths Brahmâ rewarded austerities (tapas) of men and demons
by granting them their most frequent wish, the wish for immortality. Although
that boon was limited and did not bestow complete immortality, it always
caused a great deal of trouble for the gods. So Brahmâ was usually in trouble with
the other gods. In these instances, Vishnu or S ́iva, depending on the viewpoint
of the myth, would save the gods from the demons. The supreme god, Vishnu or
S ́iva, would find the limitation of Brahmâ’s boon of immortality in order to
defeat the demon who had gained the boon and return the world to its proper
order.
In the Purânas, Brahmâ the creator was joined in a divine triad with Vishnu
and Mahes ́vara (S ́iva), who were the preserver and destroyer, respectively. The
universe was created by Brahmâ, preserved by Vishnu, and destroyed for the next
creation by S ́iva. However, the birth of Brahmâ was attributed to Vishnu in some
myths. Brahmâ was often depicted as sitting on a throne arising from the navel
of Vishnu, who was resting on the cosmic serpent, Ananta (also S ́esha). In the
very beginning Vishnu alone was there. When Vishnu thought about creation,
Brahmâ was created from a lotus that came from his navel.
There was a S ́aiva myth that told of S ́iva’s appearance to Vishnu and Brahmâ
as a cosmic linga. Vishnu attempted to go to the top and bottom of this giant pil
lar. He was only able to go to the top of the universe and the bottom of the sea,
but he did not find the end of the linga. Brahmâ lied that he had reached its end,
thus claiming to be superior to S ́iva. So S ́iva cursed him, so that Brahmâ would
never again have temples dedicated to his worship, and except for the temple to
him at Pushkara, the myth seemed to fit the facts of history so that the curse
seems to have been fulfilled.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 87



The four-headed Brahmâ is the creator in the Trimûrti or Hindu Triad, which also
includes S ́iva and Vishnu. (TRIP)



His final roles in the later Purânas were reminders of how mighty Brahmâ
was debased. One myth claimed that Brahmâ committed incest with his daugh
ter, goddess of speech (Vâc). But this myth had already been told about Prajâpati,
lord of creatures.
Iconographically, Brahmâ’s image had four heads. (A fifth had been cut off
by the fingernail of a horrific aspect of S ́iva.) He carried a water jar, offering ladle,
meditation beads, a lotus, and a bow or scepter. His vehicle was the swan
(hamsa) or goose.

BRAHMACÂRI, BRAHMACÂRYA
The stage of life (âsrama) of student
This is the first of the four âsramas, or stages of life. The other three are house
holder (grihastha), forest dweller (vânaprastha), and renunciate (samnyâsa).
A brahmacâri was one who stayed in the household of the teacher (guru, or
âcarya) and learned scriptures, rituals, and ascetic practices. It was a period of
chastity, ended by dying a symbolic death involving a bath in a river and being
reborn to marry and enter the duties of a householder.
See also Catur-Varna; Samnyâsa. The varna-as ́rama-dharma system is addressed in chapter 1 in the sections on “Hindu Worldviews” and “Dharma.”
BRAHMAN
An early term; the Absolute
The word brahman is more context-sensitive than most Sanskrit terms. It is
neuter in gender and evolved into one of the most important concepts in Hindu
theology and philosophy. For one school of Hinduism Brahman came to mean
the Absolute as impersonal and formless—and should be capitalized in English.
It could not be described in terms of anything lesser—even the most well-mean
ing personifications and projections that worshippers might attribute to the
divine.
In the earliest sections of the Vedas, however, brahman was used to mean
the magic power behind the efficacy of the Vedic sacrifices or the performative
power in the prayers or chants of the priests. As such it was associated with vâc
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 89



(speech, personified as a goddess) and prâna (breath; later, energy). Brahman was
all the enigmas of the universe. It is not surprising that throughout the centuries
brâhmins were associated with Brahman, because the prayers (brâhmanas) were
performed by the brâhmins. Any confusion among these three terms was advan
tageous to the priests. Some scriptures and myths taught that the priests were
gods on earth. However, such personifications were misrepresentations of a term
that denies every comparison. (Neti. Neti. Not this. Not this. The Absolute was
not to be described at all, declared the Upanishads.)
But in later mythology Brahman was neither the hidden power behind the
verbal contest in the brahmodya (contests in sacred knowledge) at the horse sac
rifice (as ́va-medha) nor the only reality that exists of itself. Brahman became
another superlative for whatever supreme god was being worshipped. The great
modern teacher, Shrî Râmakrishna, used to say that Brahman and the Great
Mother Kâlî were the same. That kind of identification was also made in Hindu
mythology—that the infinite and the finite were the same.

BRÂHMANAS
A division of the Vedas; a collection of scriptures
The Vedas came to be divided into the Rigveda (hymns), Brâhmanas (commen
taries), Âranyakas (forest texts), and Upanishads (a treasury of mystical and
devotional texts). The Satapatha-brâhmana was considered to be the oldest
Brâhmana. It was a great source of mantras, or incantations.
The mythological point of view changed between the period of the Rigveda
and that of the Brâhmanas. The Brâhmanas were concerned with ritual and its
effectiveness. There was a triad of gods who were most important: Agni, Indra,
and Sûrya. Agni’s role had increased, and the symbolism of the fire sacrifice was
more explicit. In the later Brâhmanas there were thirty-three devas (gods), enu
merated as eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and twelve âdityas—with two gods
unnamed.

BRAHMÂNDA
A cosmogonic principle in the Rigveda
Brahmânda, or the egg of Brahmâ (immensity), may have been the subject of an
entire book describing a creation myth, the Brahmânda Purâna. But it is no longer
extant, existing only in fragments of other works. The description of the origin of
the universe as a golden egg appeared in both Vedic and Purânic literature.
90 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



In the beginning there was nothing but the golden egg in space alone. From
it was born the Cosmic Person (virât purusha), whose different body parts
became the different planets and the four castes (varnas).
See also Purusha; Varna
BRÂHMIN (ALSO BRÂHMANA AND BRÂHMAN)
One of the four castes
The Rigveda described the origin of the four castes from parts of the cosmic per
son, Virat Purusha. The Manu-smriti (the law code of Manu) said that the four
castes where born from different parts of the body of Brahmâ. Brâhmanas (brâh
mins) were born from the face, ks ́atriyas from the arms, vais ́yas from the thighs,
and s ́ûdras from the feet of Brahmâ. The place one found in this hierarchy of
privilege ordained by birth was founded on the actions one had done in previous
lifetimes, that is, on one’s karma.
The duties of a brâhmin include performing sacrifices and learning and
teaching the scriptures. A brâhmin was also called a dvija, which means twice
born; members of the upper castes were seen as being born a second time when
they were invested with the sacred thread at the upanayana (the sacrament con
cerning one’s spiritual birth).
See also Purusha; Varna
BRIHASPATI
A sage
Brihaspati was the teacher of the devas (gods). He was born of Angiras and
Vasudhâ (or S ́raddhâ). Angiras was the son of Brahmâ, the creator, who had lost
his seed in the sacrificial fire at the sight of a celestial maiden. Sage Brihaspati
was also identified with a celestial star or planet, Jupiter. In the Rigveda there
was a god of this name (also known as Brahmanaspati).
The sage Brihaspati was married to Târâ, who was unusually beautiful. Con
sequently Târâ was abducted by Soma (or Candra, the moon), and that resulted
in a war known as Târaka-maya. Rudra and the demons were on one side with
Soma, and Brihaspati and the gods led by Indra were on the other. Brahmâ finally
restored Târâ to her husband. However, she was with child. Both Soma and Bri
haspati claimed the child, who was named Budha (planet Mercury). Finally, Târâ
said that the child was fathered by Soma.
There are many other late tales of Brihaspati where he appeared as a rishi
(sage). One sectarian episode in the Padma Purâna has him turning asuras
(demons) into Jains and Buddhists. His character was totally reversed in the story
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 91



that told of his rape of his brother’s wife, Mamatâ, and his cursing of the unborn
child in her womb (Dirghatamas) with blindness.

BUDDHA
A negative incarnation (avatâra) of Vishnu
In some accounts one of the ten incarnations of Vishnu was as the Buddha.
Vishnu came to earth in order to delude those who already deserved punishment
for their bad deeds (karma). Deceived by the Buddha’s false teachings, these indi
viduals renounced the Vedas and ceased to do their duty (dharma). They were
then punished in hell or by inferior births.
In a number of later texts, this Buddha avatâra was given a positive purpose.
Vishnu was said to have chosen the incarnation as the Buddha in order to teach
nonviolence and compassion to humanity.

CAÑCALÂKSHMÎ
(1) A famous prostitute
Once while the prostitute Cañcalâkshmî (“one with moving eyes”) was waiting
in the night for her lover, she was attacked and killed by a leopard (or in another
version, a tiger). Following her death both the attendants of Vishnu and Yama
came to take her soul. They began to argue. Yama’s servants pointed out the fact
that she had sinned throughout her life. Vishnu’s emissaries argued that she had
on one occasion in her life gone into a temple to Vishnu and spilled some lime
juice on the wall. That act was seen by the all-gracious Vishnu as the service of
cleaning the walls of a temple. For that Vishnu had chosen to give her life with
him in Vaikuntha, his heaven. So she gained paradise almost by accident.
If one worshipped Vishnu with mindful intent, how much more would one
be rewarded, was the message of this myth.
See also Vishnu; Yama
(2) A Vidhyadhara girl
Cañcalâkshmî, the celestial, was raped by the demon Râvana, while her mind
was fixed in prayer. She was praying to the goddess Mahâlakshmî. Cañcalâkshmî
cursed Râvana, stating he would be killed by Lâkshmi. In the course of time Lâk
shmi was incarnated as Sîtâ. Râvana abducted Sîtâ, and Râvana was killed by
Lord Râma. Thus the curse was fulfilled. Râvana’s act was avenged by Lâkshmi,
born as Sîtâ, at the hands of her husband Râma.

CANDA AND MUNDA
Two asura (demon) brothers
Canda and his young asura brother Munda allied with the great demons,
S ́umbha and Nis ́umbha. The latter two asura brothers had just returned from
heaven after receiving a boon from Brahmâ that they could only be killed at the
hands of a woman. After receiving this boon S ́umbha and Nis ́umbha and their
asura armies conquered the three worlds of heaven, earth, and Pâtâla (the nether
world). On the advice of the sage Brihaspati the frightened devas (gods) went to
Pârvatî, the wife of S ́iva. After hearing their pitiful plea, Pârvatî-devî went into
a deep state of meditation, and out of her body emerged Kâlî (or Kausikî). Kâlî
disguised as a beautiful woman sat alone in the forest, where she was seen by
Canda and Munda. They reported their great discovery to S ́umbha and
Nis ́umbha. Canda and Munda (some accounts say another demon named Dhûm
râksha, a cohort of Râvana) were sent along with sixty thousand soldiers to bring
the beautiful woman to their court. By the sound hum Kâlî reduced all of them
to ashes and then killed S ́umbha and Nis ́umbha for good measure.

CANDAKA
A hunter and an ardent devotee of S ́iva
While hunting in the forest one day Candaka saw a S ́iva temple in ruins. He
reported the dilapidated condition of this temple to Simhaketu, the king of Pân
chala. After consulting the scriptures, Simhaketu allowed Candaka to install a
S ́iva linga, the phallic symbol of S ́iva, and said Candaka could start worshipping
it on one condition: that he smear himself with the ashes from the nearby cre
mation ground. Candaka and his wife Pulindî worshipped the linga for a long
time. Then one day Candaka did not have any ash and hence could not worship.
At this point Pulindî suggested that she should become the ash that Candaka
would wear so that he would not have to interrupt his worship (bhakti, pûjâ).
Candaka agreed with great reluctance. Pulindî burned into ash, and Candaka per
formed his worship of Lord S ́iva. When he finished, to his utter surprise Pulindî
regained her life and stood before him. A celestial chariot came from S ́ivaloka
(S ́iva’s realm) and took both of them to heaven.

CANDIKÂ

hands, each holding a weapon. Her vehicle was a lion, and she stood with her left
foot on the corpse of the demon called Mahisha-asura and held his severed head
aloft. From the bloody neck of the felled demon emerged a red-headed, red-eyed
man with weapon drawn but already noosed by Candikâ’s rope.
In the Devî Mâhâtmya Candikâ has become the s ́aktî of the Goddess her
self so that Durgâ (or Devî) possesses a feminine manifestation of her divine
activity rather than needing a masculine actor; in the final evolution of this
myth cycle the feminine is complete in itself.
See also Durgâ; Mahishâsura; Pârvatî
CANDRA
The moon, a deva
In the Vedic period Candra, the moon, and Soma, the entheogenic plant, were
connected by associations (bandhus) in the early hymns. However, Candra was
not one of the âdityas with Sûrya (the sun), but was one of the eight Vasus with
Vâyu (the wind). By the Purânic period Candra’s very essence had changed to
that of just another Vedic deity to use as a bad example in the self-elevation or
pride of medieval priests.
Candra’s highest birth in the myths was as an emergence from the Churn
ing of the Milky Ocean (kshîrâbdhi-mathanam). He was also described as the
son of the sage Atri and Anasûyâ. Other accounts said his father was Dharma.
The Brihadâranyaka said that he was not a brâhmin at all but a ks ́atriya. These
inconsistencies were usually explained away by using the notion of different
births in different yugas (world ages) or manvantaras (world cycles). But his
essence had become something that did not need a worthy lineage—he had been
transformed from a companion of Soma, at the very center of Vedic religious
experience, to a marginalized seducer of the wife of a great brâhmin sage. (The
story of Târâ illustrates the Purânic mentality of defaming its heroes and hero
ines, since some accounts make her a willing participant in adultery and others
exonerate her and present her as one of the pañcakanayâ, five perfect women.)
This episode had a strange ending: the usual seducer of brâhmins’ wives, Indra,
acted as the defender of moral duty (dharma) and fought great battles with Can
dra. Candra was finally given the son of his misdeed—the beautiful star-child
born to Târâ was Budha (the planet Mercury).
The Devî Bhâgavata contained a fragment of what could be an older myth
of the moon. Candra was said to have married the twenty-seven daughters of
Daksha, a progenitor. His twenty-seven wives were the twenty-seven brightest
stars of the Vedic sky. However, the Purânas used his plural marriage to make
Candra an example of a bad husband. When twenty-six of Candra’s wives com
94 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



plained to their father Daksha that Candra loved Rohinî more than the rest and
did not give them enough recognition, Daksha asked Candra to love his wives
equally. Candra did not obey, so Daksha cursed Candra: he would suffer various
diseases and would lose part of his body for fourteen days every month. That
curse accounted for the waxing and waning of the moon.

CANDRÂNGADA
A prince
Candrângada’s story has another myth nested within it of a curious gender trans
formation. The Purânic mythmakers did not portray a supreme god or goddess
remedying the situation in this case, as they so often did. In fact, neither sages
nor the divine mother (Pârvatî) seemed able to reverse this permanent gender
change, which had resulted from cross-dressing.
Prince Candrângada has married to Sîmantini, a brâhmin (daughter of Yaj
navalkya and Maitreyi). Later when Candrângada was riding in a boat with his
friends in the river Kailindi, a storm broke out, and the boat capsized. All his
friends were drowned. As Candrângada sank to the bottom of the river, the serpent
(nâga) king Takshâka took him to the underwater world of the serpents (pâtâla).
While Candrângada lived there for a long time, his funeral rites were performed.
Sîmantini began living as a widow, and his father’s kingdom was conquered by
their enemies. After Candrângada had enjoyed a time of sporting with the nâga
damsels, Takshâka proposed that Candrângada should marry them. This helped
him remember that he had been married to Sîmantini and had to go back home.
Candrângada was sent back to the earth with many presents from Takshâka.
There was a joyous reunion with Sîmantini, and they began living again as hus
band and wife. The enemy kings even released Candrângada’s father and gave
back his kingdom.
Both Candrângada and Sîmantini were great devotees of Pârvatî and
observed a specific ritualistic fasting on Mondays called the soma-varavrata
(“Monday boon-seeking fast”). Pârvatî appeared and blessed them. Observing
this piety, three impoverished brâhmin brothers, Sumedha, Sârasvata, and
Sâmavan, thought they would be able to obtain enough money from Candrân
gada and Sîmantini to gain brides for themselves. After listening to their story,
Candrângada and Sîmantini took Sârasvata and Sâmavan in a procession around
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 95



the palace—with Sâmavan dressed as a woman. But Sâmavan’s womanhood
manifested itself and could not be changed back into manhood. Even the
attempts by sages and fervent appeals to Pârvatî to change him back to a man
failed. Pârvatî suggested the solution, according to the S ́iva Purâna. Sâmavan
was renamed Sâmavatî. So Sârasvata and Sâmavatî lived as husband and wife.
There was no report that the former brothers were married by priestly rites.

CANDRASHARMAN
A sinner who had killed his teacher
Candrasharman’s story was told along with that of three other sinners in the
Padma Purâna. These four had committed that period’s four most terrible sins:
killing a cow (go-hatyâ), killing one’s teacher (guru-hatyâ), killing a brâhmin
(brâhma-hatyâ), and sleeping with the wife of one’s guru (agamyâgamana). The
outcaste Vidura, a Pâñcâla des ́a [Pâñcama jana—an outcaste], had killed a brâh
min and had visited all the pilgrimage sites (tîrthas) to no avail. Before commit
ting the greatest of all sins, he had been a ks ́atriya. Candrasharman, a brâhmin,
had killed his teacher (who might have been a brâhmin, but in any case Can
drasharman’s sin was considered less, perhaps because he was himself a brâh
min). Vedasharman, another brâhmin, slept with his teacher’s wife. The final
sinner was a vais ́ya (merchant caste) named Vañjula who had killed a cow.
Although they gathered in the same place to share their stories, the myth made
it clear that they did not add a further sin: that of breaking caste law. They did
not have food together, sit on the same seat, or lie on the same bed sheet. And
the three who had not become outcastes did not touch the outcaste. Then an
evolved soul, a siddha, instructed them to wash in the Gangâ. When they did,
all were absolved of their sins.

CATUR-MUKHA-LINGA
Four-faced emblem of Brahmâ
After creation of the world, the five-headed Brahmâ was resting and thinking
about the next creation when a beautiful woman appeared before him. Even
though she was born of him, Brahmâ became attracted to her and let his passion
go. For this sin one of his heads broke off. He went to Sthânu tîrtha, one of the
famous pilgrimage sites on the Sarasvatî River. Undoubtedly punning, the myth
made Brahmâ construct a linga with his own four faces (thus the catur-mukha
linga) from the fifth head that had broken off. Worship of the linga absolved

CATUR-VARNA (CATURVARNYAM)
The four (catur) castes (varna)
The brâhmin, ks ́atriya, vais ́ya, and s ́ûdra castes originated from the body of
Brahmâ, according to the Rigveda. The later purusha (cosmic man) myth posited
their origin from the self-sacrifice of the “first man,” god creating by self-divi
sion. By the late Vedic period four castes, instead of three, and a definite hierar
chy with the brâhmins at the top had been firmly established. The first three
castes were twice born, leaving the s ́ûdras without a second or ritual birth.
Therefore, s ́ûdras could be not eligible to study Sanskrit or learn the Vedas and
the accompanying rituals.
Caste is an unhappy translation of varna, as varna is the ancient ideal social
system of Vedic religion whereas “caste” refers to actual jati (birth) system of
today. The myths mix praise of varna dharma (the ideals of an ordered and right
eous society) with criticism of a mixing of races and groups that reflects a
decline of society into the moment that another destruction will be inevitable.
The varna-as ́rama-dharma system is addressed in chapter 1 in the sections
on “Hindu Worldviews” and “Dharma.”

CHÂYÂ
A goddess (a replica of a goddess; literally, “shade,” or “shadow”)
The goddess Samjñâ created her replica, Châyâ, in order to fool her husband, the
sun (Sûrya). After having three children by Sûrya (Manu, Yama, and Yamî),
Samjñâ could no longer stand the heat of his affections. So she created Châyâ to
take her place. Things went well for a while, and Châyâ gave birth to Sani (the
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 97



planet Saturn), a Manu (first human of a cosmic age) known as Savarni, and a
river goddess, Tapatî. Châyâ treated her own children so well that Yama, who
had been fooled as completely as his father Sûrya, tried to kick the woman he
believed was his mother out of jealousy. Châyâ cursed him so that the foot that
he raised against her would forevermore be afflicted with sores and worms. That
was certainly fitting for the future god of death. Sûrya suddenly realized that she
could not be the real mother of Yama, so he searched for his real wife. He found
Samjñâ and brought her home.
Another version makes Châyâ the daughter of Vis ́vakarma and therefore the
sister of Samjñâ.

CITRAKETU
A king who longed for a son
This nested myth within a myth begins with a king and queen being granted a
child; they then gain the blessing of becoming gandharvas (celestial musicians),
but the story ends with the king cursed to become a demon.
According to the Bhâgavata Purâna King Citraketu and his queen had been
childless for many years before they received a blessing from the sage Angiras.
From that blessing came a son. However, not long after the infant died. With great
sorrow Citraketu took the body of his son to Angiras. Angiras was being attended
by Brahmâ and the sage Nârada. Angiras used his great powers and gave life back
to the infant. Upon regaining his life, this child could not recognize his parents
and asked Angiras to choose for him his parents from his many previous births.
Brahmâ and Nârada became confused with the complex questions on birth and
rebirth, but before leaving they gave their spiritual wisdom to King Citraketu.
98 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Citraketu concentrated this mind for eight days on the divine, and both he and
his wife were turned into gandharvas. One day while they were enjoying their
powers of flight, they flew over Mount Kailâsa and saw Pârvatî sitting on the
thighs of S ́iva. Citraketu laughed. Pârvatî, enraged by this rude act of Citraketu,
cursed him to become a demon. Citraketu was then born as Vritra-asura.

CITRALEKHÂ
Daughter of the demon Bana
This little story has great popular appeal. One even finds it alluded to or even
added as a scene within modern Indian films or video serials.
According to the Bhâgavata Purâna Chitralekhâ had an unusual ability to
draw portraits. She drew one from an account of a dream that Ushâ, a
princess, gave. The portrait actually was the picture of someone whom Ushâ
was yet to meet. Ushâ fell in love with the portrait and then discovered that
it was Aniruddha, grandson of Krishna. Later, when Aniruddha was brought
to Ushâ’s room and saw his own picture, he too fell in love with her, and they
were married.

CITRÂNGADÂ
(1) The third wife of Arjuna
This myth is nested within several other myths within the Mahâbhârata. There
was a devout worshipper of S ́iva who has been promised a son but could not pro
duce one himself. His daughter, Princess Citrângadâ, succeeded in bearing a son
by the hero Arjuna, who is given this reason for leaving his joint wife Draupadî
(taking another wife in order to fulfil a boon granted by S ́iva).
Previously, Prince Arjuna was forced to leave home because he broke an
agreement that the five brothers (the Pandavas) made in order to have privacy
with their common wife Draupadî (also called Pâñcâlî, princess of Pañcâli). Any
brother interrupting another would go into exile or on a pilgrimage for a year. So
it happened that Arjuna made the mistake of intruding and honorably set forth.
But before he could get to the right kingdom and be the agent of S ́iva’s grace for
King Citravâhana, Citrângadâ’s father, Arjuna had another adventure in a nâga
(serpent) kingdom. He married the nâga princess Ulûpî, who later became the
nurse of his son with Citrângadâ. One Purâna added the detail that Arjuna had
a son by princess Ulûpî before leaving the land of the serpents.
With this background, enough of the elements of Citrângadâ’s story were in
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 99



place for the story itself to be told. Of course there were always more connec
tions and versions that could be added for a really good audience.
Citrângadâ, daughter of King Citravâhana of Manalûr, instantly fell in love
with Arjuna, and he with her, and she proposed to him. The king was overjoyed
to acquire such an important prince and warrior as his son-in-law and sanctioned
the marriage. A son was born to them named Babhruvâhana before Arjuna
needed to return home from exile. The nâga princess Ulûpî became Babhru
vâhana’s nurse.
Much later, after the horse sacrifice (as ́va-medha) following the great battle of
the plains of Kurukshetra, Arjuna had the honor of following the wild stallion in
battle. Where the stallion wandered, Arjuna and his army followed, conquering
each kingdom in turn. But when he reached Manalûr, a young warrior, Babhru
vâhana, met Arjuna in battle and slew him. Then both Chitrângadâ and Ulûpî came
to the battlefield and saw their dead husband. Ulûpî used the magic diamond,
Mrita-sañjîvanî (“making alive the dead”), to bring Arjuna back to life. Then Arjuna
took his two wives and his son back home to the Pandava capital of Hastinâpura.

(2) The daughter of Vis ́vakarma, the celestial architect
One day while she and her friends were taking a bath in a forest pond, Cit
rângadâ saw Prince Suratha, son of Sudeva, walking by. She recognized that
Suratha was in love and that she would give herself to him. Her friends tried to
restrain her impulse but could not. Learning of this, her father, Vis ́vakarma,
cursed her that she would never marry. Citrângadâ fainted, but her friends
believed that she was dead and took her to the cremation ground beside the
Sarasvatî River. They left her there while they looked for firewood for her pyre.
She awoke and, believing that all had abandoned her, attempted to drown her
self in the river. The Sarasvatî pushed her into the Gomatî River, and it in turn
washed her ashore far from home. She awakened this time and saw a sage called
Ritadhvaja. She told him her sad story. Ritadhvaja blessed her with a boon that
reversed the curse and cursed her father Vis ́vakarma to be reborn a monkey for
his cruel deed. Citrângadâ then married Prince Suratha.

CITRARATHA
A gandharva (celestial musician)
In the Mahâbhârata while the Pandavas were walking in the forest after killing
the demons Hidimbha and Baka, they heard a sound in the river nearby of some
body taking a bath. Arjuna went to see who was taking a bath at night. He saw
100 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



the gandharva king Citraratha and his wife Kumbhinasî bathing together. It was
the only moment that it was possible for a human to see a gandharva—at twi
light when it was between night and day. Citraratha was furious at having a
human spy on his privacy and began a battle with Arjuna. Arjuna defeated the
gandharva, and Citraratha taught Arjuna the magic science of cakshushi-vidya,
the ability to see anything in the three worlds. He also gave Arjuna many other
gifts, such as chariots and horses. Arjuna in return taught Citraratha about his
magic weapon called the Agnis ́ira.

CITRASENA
A gandharva (celestial musician)
Citrasena had many roles in the Purânic and Epic literature.
While flying overhead in his celestial chariot, Citrasena accidentally spat on
the sage Gâlava, who complained to Krishna, who in turn vowed to kill Cit
rasena before sunset. The good old sage Nârada telepathically learned of all this
and told Citrasena. So Citrasena’s two wives, Sandhyâvalî and Ratnâvalî, made
a firepit before the abode of Subhadrâ, wife of Arjuna and sister of Krishna. They
planned either to win her help or to die with their husband on his funeral pyre.
Subhadrâ granted them the boon that they could live with their husband before
knowing the full story. So Arjuna had to come to the aid of Citrasena and to stop
all of the arrows that Krishna aimed at Citrasena. He did this so well that it
became a fight between Arjuna and Krishna. Subhadrâ was finally able to stop
their fight, and Krishna allowed Citrasena to apologize to the sage Gâlava.
On an occasion in the Mahâbhârata, at a time when mortals could see gand
harvas, Duryodhana and his army came into the Dvaitavana forest to kill the
Pandavas. They stumbled upon Citrasena and his troop bathing in a forest pond.
Haughtily they ordered the gandharvas out so that their king could bathe alone.
A fight ensued, with Citrasena routing the Kaurava army and binding the cap
tured Duryodhana. A helpless Kaurava went to Arjuna and begged his help to
free Duryodhana from this terrible foe. Of course Arjuna went to his enemy’s aid
and fought a foe that he did not recognize. Finally after much combat, Citrasena
took the form that Arjuna recognized. So Arjuna was able to ask Citrasena to
release Duryodhana. After a short time Duryodhana and the Kauravas expressed
their gratitude by renewing their evil ways. (It still delights the hearers of all ages
that they know the nature of Duryodhana better than Arjuna.)
Next Citrasena taught Arjuna dance and music in the court of Indra. While
there the much-celebrated apsara Urvas ́î became attracted to Arjuna. However
Arjuna declined her advances. The frustrated Urvas ́î cursed Arjuna to become a
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 101



eunuch. This curse was a blessing to Arjuna and enabled him to stay incognito
as a dance teacher in the palace of King Virata during a year when he needed to
go unrecognized. It was through Citrasena that Indra sent a message to Urvas ́î to
remove her curse.

CÛDÂLA
A queen and great scholar
Queen Cûdâla’s accomplishment was placed long ago in the first Dvâpara yuga
of the seventh manvantara (world cycle). Perhaps that placement in an age of
greater spiritual potential was why ks ́atriyas were able to achieve great powers
(siddhis) without mention of a brâhmin teacher and a woman could learn faster
than her husband. It seemed also to be a time when humans did not wish to yield
to the temptation of calling for help from a god. An alternative interpretation is
that we are dealing with an anti-priestly myth with a revolutionary notion that
spiritual practice rather than high-caste birth was the more important factor.
Acccording to the Jñânavâsishtham King S ́ikhidhvaja and Queen Cûdâla of
Mâlava practiced jñâna-yoga (the discipline of knowledge) together. (This myth
and its scriptural source are proof of a time when jñâna-yoga was more than just
mystical practice.) Cûdâla began to gain powers (siddhis), including levitation
and travel through the air. The king decided that he would not be able to achieve
such powers living in the palace, even though his wife had. So he retired into the
forest and performed austerities (tapas) there. Cûdâla finally went to him in dis
guise and stood before him without touching the ground. S ́ikhidhvaja naturally
assumed that a being whose feet did not touch the ground must be a deva, so he
began to reverence this being. Cûdâla assumed her true form and convinced
S ́ikhidhvaja to return to the palace and practice jñâna-yoga there. However,
before they left the forest, Cûdâla used her great power to create a seductress
named Urvas ́î as well as gods like Indra to test her husband’s resolve. Then she
took him back to the palace, where they both advanced in jñâna-yoga.

CYAVANA
An asura (demon) sage
Cyavana was a son of the great teacher and priest of the demons, Bhrigu. Cya
vana had become a great magician like his father, but he had grown old and
blind. The As ́vins, the Divine Twins, cured Cyavana of both his old age and
blindness. After getting back his youth, Cyavana was extremely happy with the
102 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



As ́vins, who had won their fame as physicians to the gods. Now Indra had
banned the As ́vins from partaking of soma, the celestial drink. Cyavana prom
ised that he would help them get soma, even if it meant opposing Indra, king of
the gods. Cyavana organized a soma sacrifice (soma-yâga) and invited all the
devas, including the As ́vins. Indra was furious to see the As ́vins at the yâga and
ordered them to leave. Consequently, Cyavana started a fight with Indra using
all his magical powers. He made a demon called Mada out of the sacrificial fire
and sent it to kill Indra. Indra attempted to use his vajrâyudha, his war disc, to
retaliate, but found all his limbs frozen. Indra prayed to his guru Brihaspati. And
Brihaspati advised him to give up and apologize to Cyavana. Cyavana accepted
Indra’s apology, but then Indra used that moment of truce to tear the demon sage
into four pieces. These four pieces became the game of dice, hunting, wine, and
women. And all still have magical power over men.

DADHÎCI OR DADHÎCA
A sage
Dadhîci had been made from the essence of the world by his father, the great
ascetic Bhrigu. He too became an ascetic and engaged in severe tapas (austeri
ties). Indra became afraid that his position of Indrahood (as king of the gods) was
threatened by a yogi with such power (siddhi). So Indra sent Alambushâ, one of
his apsaras (celestial damsels), to deter Dadhîci from his austerities. Watching
the dance of Alambushâ at his hermitage, Dadhîci had a seminal discharge,
which fell into the river Sarasvatî. Sarasvatî gave birth to a son named Sârasvata.
The sage blessed him with the divine power to cause the rain that would end a
twelve-year drought. Sarasvatî took their child to her abode and raised him.
Dadhîci was also known for his readiness to sacrifice even his own life for a
noble cause. Unable to defeat a demon named Vritra, Indra went to Brahmâ for
his advice. (Vritra had been a serpent monster that prevented the rains in Vedic
mythology.) In this myth from the epic period, Brahmâ advised Indra that he
would be able to kill Vritrâsura with a weapon made of the bone of Dadhîci.
With much hesitation Indra went to the sage and told him about Brahmâ’s
advice. Without a moment’s reflection Dadhîci abandoned his body for this
noble cause. Indra killed the demon and his army with the weapon made of Dad
hîci’s bone. It became Indra’s powerful vajra (diamond) weapon.

as the Kshudrakas were one exception. They came to the aid of Duryodhana and
the Kauravas. Bhîshma even had the Kshudrakas attack Arjuna. In another incar
nation myth most of the Kshudrakas were exterminated, along with the
ks ́atriyas, by the brâhmin-warrior Paras ́u-Râma (Râma-with-the-ax, an avatâra).
Later in S ́âkta myths the dâkinîs were transformed into the blood drinkers
(ashrapas) of Kâlî and were her fiendish helpers, who feed on human flesh. The
dâkinîs would acquire an even more important role in the mythology and
iconography of Tântric Buddhism, especially as it developed in Tibet (see Detlef

DAKSHA
A prajâpati (creator or progenitor)
In the Rigveda (2:27:1) Daksha (ritual skill) was one of the six âdityas, deities
related so closely to Vedic sacrificial ritual that they may be called personifica
tions of its logic and method. During the Vedic period the six expanded to
twelve, with Daksha always among the most important. Ritual skill in sacrifi
cial magic-science was then central to Vedic and Brâhmanical religion and
mythology.
In the great Hindu epics, references to Daksha abound, as numerous versions
of his myth were recorded without much regard for consistency. Daksha was born
from the right thumb of Brahmâ, or had his origin with the six or seven mahâr
ishis or with the eight prajâpatis, or was even one of the mind-born of Brahmâ.
His fluid nature ranged from being father of energies like Garuda (the sun bird) to
being father of some minor demons. The idea of Daksha’s sacrifice began in the
epics. Daksha, whose very name must be associated with sacrificial ritual,
presided over a sacrifice in which S ́iva misbehaved by kicking out the teeth of the
god Pûshan (the nourisher and protector of cattle), put out the eyes of the god
Bhaga (inheritance), and broke the arms of the solar god Sâvitrî (vivifier).
In the Purânas the myths reached a point where there were either two sep
arate Dakshas or Daksha’s life must be interpreted in two cycles—one as a pra
jâpati and another as a rebirth as the Daksha who would not invite S ́iva to his
sacrifice. In his role as Prajâpati, following the account in the Vishnu Purâna,
Daksha was ordered by Brahmâ to create all the subjects (prajas). So Daksha cre
ated devas, sages, gandharvas, asuras, nagas, and so on. Turning these out one
at a time was not efficient. So he invented coition and produced with his wife
As ́iknî five thousand sons, the Haryashvas. However, Nârada—a sage whose
Purânic role was to make trouble or to tell secrets—sent the Haryashvas to learn
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 105



the wonders of the world, and they never came back. Again Daksha and As ́iknî
went back to work and created a new race—a thousand S ́abalâs ́vas. And once
again Nârada sent them to the ends of the earth, and they too were lost. Daksha
angrily cursed Nârada to be a homeless wanderer (and all know this curse as the
reason why Nârada was always available for a grand entrance into any myth).
Then wise Daksha created by coition sixty daughters, giving them as wives to
the gods and lesser prajâpatis: ten to Dharma, thirteen to Kas ́yâpa, twenty-seven
to Soma (or Candra, the moon), four to Arishthanemi, two to Angiras, and two
to Krishâshva. Daksha had twenty-four more daughters by Prasûtî, one of whom,
Sîtâ, he gave to S ́iva and another to Bhrigu, his father in the Epics but now his
son-in-law. At this point the Purânic mythmakers chose to end the myth of the
venerable and wise Prajâpati Daksha or to re-introduce him in another lifetime
in a S ́aiva myth cycle.
In the S ́iva Purâna Daksha became a very negative figure who tried to
humiliate the Absolute, which in this Purâna was S ́iva. Daksha objected to his
daughter Satî’s relationship with S ́iva. Even though it was assumed that Satî was
already S ́iva’s wife, there was a noteworthy omission of a proper wedding. Such
a wedding would have legitimated S ́iva ritually and would have made Daksha’s
objection to S ́iva’s presence at an orthodox sacrifice to the gods without mean
ing. This myth addressed something that has had currency even in the modern
period: that S ́iva and his cult were not Vedic and his presence would pollute
Daksha’s ritual. Most accounts present S ́iva as being unconcerned about not
receiving an invitation, but everything changed because of what happened when
Satî went alone—against S ́iva’s advice. Daksha’s later Purânic persona behaved
badly, humiliating Satî so totally that she threw herself into the sacrificial fire,
turning it into a funeral pyre, and becoming an example of a woman’s ultimate
sacrifice (sati), the self-immolation of a wife, who thereby becomes a model of
purity). Satî became a satî (“a pure one” feminine) by committing sati.
S ́iva became outraged. From his anger two demonic figures were created,
Vîrabhadra and Bhadra-Kâlî, and they killed Daksha and destroyed his sacrifice.
But what S ́iva won in this myth by brute force, he also lost: he was the causal
agent in the killing of the brâhmin Daksha. And non-Shaiva myths added this
sin to other reasons S ́iva and his cult were less Vedic and less orthodox.
This myth was important devotionally, however, as it taught that devo
tion to S ́iva was more important than sacrifices or rituals performed without
devotion.

106 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



DÂLBHYA
A sage
This is an example of a myth about a priestly curse that explains the bad fortune
of a king and a kingdom. Such a myth served as an advertisement of the powers
(siddhis) of brâhmins and their ability to bless or curse. This late story in the
Vâmana Purâna referred back to the setting of the great war told in the Mahâb
hârata and why King Dhritarâshthra’s kingdom was destroyed. The listeners
would appreciate an addition to the many other reasons that they already knew
from the episodes of the Mahâbhârata.
A group of brâhmins, including the sage Dâlbhya, asked King Dhritarâshthra
for alms in the holy Naimisha forest. But he refused them and they vowed
revenge. Dâlbhya officiated at a sacrifice intended to cause the kingdom of Dhri
tarâshthra to decline. Realizing his mistake, Dhritarâshthra went to Dâlbhya and
gave him money and presents. So Dâlbhya stopped the curse and blessed Dhri

DAMAYANTÎ
Daughter of King Bhîma of Vidarbha and wife of Prince Nala
Damayantî was born from the blessing of her childless parents by the sage
Dama. She grew into a beauty whose fame reached the attention of Prince Nala.
Damayantî also knew of this handsome prince from those divine messengers,
the swans. The two fell in love without even meeting.
King Bhîma announced a svayamvara (a ks ́atriya custom in which the
princess could select her own husband). Nala set out for the kingdom of
Vidarbha with the hope of being chosen by Damayantî but was met by four
gods—Indra, Agni, Varuna, and Yama. He did what was proper and promised to
do their will. They gave him the power (siddhi) of invisibility to allow him to
get past the other suitors and the palace guards so that Nala could tell
Damayantî to choose one of them. However, Damayantî did not agree to chose
one of the gods. When the contest began, the gods took the shape of Nala so that
there were five Nalas in the line of suitors. But love aided Damayantî’s choice.
The gods were pleased with the respect they had been given and with the fine
characters of the couple. So they blessed them. Nala was given a special blessing
from each god: divine presence from Agni, righteous action from Yama, the abil
ity to obtain water with a thought from Varuna, and liberation (moksha) after
completing a sacrifice to the gods from Indra.
Their story was nested in a story told by the sage Brihadasva to Dharmapu

tra (another name for Yudhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother), while he was
lamenting Arjuna’s absence during their stay in the forest. Arjuna had gone to
Kailâsa to do austerities and to win a boon from S ́iva—the divine weapon called
Pasupata.
This myth about young love is one of the most popular love stories in Indian
literature. It continues with many episodes, including a gambling episode in
which Nala lost everything, modeled on another famous gambling story of the
Pandavas.

DAS ́ARATHA
A king, father of S ́rî Râma
To be so great a figure as to have a god born as one’s son, one must have a dis
tinguished lineage, excellent karma (based on what one had done in past lives),
and a record of devotion and service to the gods. All of these elements were pro
vided in the various episodes about King Das ́aratha. Various compositions and
retellings of the Râmâyana nest one myth within another, to the great delight
of Indian audiences throughout the centuries. There were enough blessings and
cursings, magical powers, and divine visitations reaching into the future and
turning back into the past to fully satisfy. Several episodes must suffice to illus
trate these rich myths: a curse from the king’s youth, great deeds and a boon to
one of his wives, temple worship and austerities for a son, and death by a pre
dicted curse.
Once while he was hunting, Das ́aratha heard a sound from the river that
was similar to the sound of an elephant drinking water. Das ́aratha, without
thinking, shot his arrow, only to discover that he had mortally wounded a brâh
min boy collecting water for his aged parents. S ́ravana, the young boy, asked
Das ́aratha to take water to his parents at their hermitage, since they did not have
anybody else to help them. Das ́aratha took the water to the hermitage and told
the aged parents about the accidental death of their son. They asked Das ́aratha
to take them to their dead son. They made a funeral pyre for S ́ravana. Then the
aged parents cursed Das ́aratha to die from the loss of his own children. Then
both parents jumped into the funeral pyre of their son and died.
Years passed. The devas (gods) asked for Das ́aratha’s help in their battles
with the asuras (demons). During this service to the gods one of his three wives,
Kaikeyî, twice saved his life on the battlefield and gained two boons, which she
was to use much later. Years and episodes rolled by. Das ́aratha and his wives
remained childless. He entrusted his kingdom to his ministers and began to prac
tice devotion by building a temple and worshipping an image of Lord Vishnu. He
108 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



also gained the help of an ascetic named Rishyas ́ringa, who performed the magic
incantation for children (putrakâmeshthi). From the sacrificial fire and the
chanting (mantrayâna) a luminous figure arose with a pot of pudding and placed
it before Rishyas ́ringa. He gave it to the king with more mantras. According to
Rishyas ́ringa’s instructions King Das ́aratha gave a portion to each of his wives:
half to Kaushalyâ, who conceived Râma, a half incarnation of Vishnu, a fourth
to Kaikeyî, who conceived Bharata, a one-fourth incarnation of Vishnu, and a
fourth to Sumitrâ, who conceived two sons, Lakshmana and S ́atrughna, each a
one-eighth incarnation of Vishnu.
Years passed. The sons married, and Das ́aratha was prepared to pass his
kingdom to the son of his first wife, Kaushalyâ’s son Râma. Now the boon to
Kaikeyî had its karmic unfolding. She demanded that her son, Bharata, be
crowned king and that Râma be exiled for fourteen years to the forest. Thus, all
this was nested in the Râma myth cycle, which in turn nested within the Vishnu
myth cycle.
However, Das ́aratha’s story must be brought to an end. It was because of the
curse of the brâhmin boy’s parents that Das ́aratha died of intense sorrow after
exiling S ́rî Râma to the forest. S ́rî Râma and Lakshmana along with Sîtâ would
have to spend fourteen years in exile because of Das ́aratha’s deeds (karma).

DATTÂTREYA
A sage
Dattâtreya had wonderful parents: the sage Atri and his wife Anasûyâ. Dat
tâtreya was an incarnation of Vishnu according to some Purânas.
Why did Lord Vishnu incarnate as Dattâtreya? The Brahmânda Purâna
traced the story back to a hermit named Ani-Mândavya who meditated under a
vow of silence. In pursuit of robbers who dropped their loot beside Ani-Mân
davya, the king’s guards bound the yogi and dragged him off to prison. The king
ordered his execution on a trident, and Ani-Mândavya suffered but did not die.
Adding another element of the divine plan, Sîlavatî, a devoted wife, was car
rying her leprous husband Ugratapas on her shoulders to the house of a harlot,
as was his wish. They passed by Ani-Mândavya, who was still alive even though
he was skewered on the trident. Mândavya saw them and cursed Ugratapas to
die before sunrise. (See “Ani-Mândavya” for the ending of that episode.)
Sîlavatî used her acquired siddhis (ascetic powers) to cause the sun not to
rise. And when it did not rise, the gods went to the Trimûrtis (Brahmâ, Vishnu,
and S ́iva) and prayed that the problem be solved. The Trimûrtis went to Anasûyâ
and asked for her help with Sîlavatî. Anasûyâ and the gods succeeded in getting
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 109



Sîlavatî to allow the sun to rise by granting that her husband Ugratapas would
not die. Then the Trimûrtis gave Anasûyâ a boon. She stated that she did not
want any boon, except that the Trimûrtis take birth as her sons. The boon was
granted. Vishnu was born as Dattâtreya, S ́iva as Durvâsa, and Brahmâ as Candra.
Dattâtreya grew up as a hermit with wonderful siddhis. Arjuna under the
patronymic (a name formed from that of a father or ancestor) of Kârtavîrya (also
Kârtavîryârjuna) came to Dattâtreya and worshipped him. This pleased Dattâtreya,
and he gave King Kârtavîrya a boon of a thousand arms. The Brahma Purâna stated
that further worship brought gifts of a golden chariot, power to rule justly, a boon
to conquer the earth and to rule it righteously, and invincibility—death only at the
hands of a warrior whose fame had spread over the entire world. King Kârtavîrya
(Arjuna) then ruled for 85,000 years of peace and prosperity. The bringing about of
such a rule of dharma would be a worthy reason for the incarnation of Vishnu as
Dattâtreya. However, though the longing for such a rule to supplant that of Mus
lims in late medieval India may have influenced the myth, the expectation failed.
And Dattâtreya failed with it. He became a victim of Râvana’s conquests, confined
like a wild beast in the corner of his city. Another ending of his life made him a
thief, robbing the wife of Jamadagni of the calf of the divine milk cow. He was pun
ished by another avatâra of Vishnu, Paras ́u-Râma (Râma with the ax), with some
versions stating that Paras ́u-Râma came into human form just to kill Dattâtreya
(one incarnation of Vishnu killing another).

DEVA, DEVAS; DEVÎ, DEVÎS
A god, deity; one of a class of celestial gods
In Hinduism the divine may be viewed as having form (murti) and attributes
(gunas) or being without any form or qualities at all (nirguna). The former per
spective was for those with little understanding and in need of every hint possi
ble. Myths about devas added shape and form to the divine mystery.
The word deva is derived from the word for light, since a deva is one who
shines forth. It was said in some sacred texts that it was related to the word for
play as well. The word is older than its use in the Rigveda with a parallel in
ancient Persian. In Sanskrit deva referred to the gods, those beings of light that
might even be seen at the sacrifice when soma (a possible hallucinogen) was
drunk by the worshippers. Opposing the devas were the asuras (demons). In
ancient Persian (Avestan) the terms meant the opposite: ahura referred to the
“lord or lords,” and daivas to the loud, aggressive beings who did not follow
truth (asha). Persian ahuras to be taken as gods (devas) in India were Varuna,
lord of truth (in Sanskrit, rita) and ruler of night, and Mitra, lord of the day.
110 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Although deva is masculine, there are also a few devîs, the feminine form,
in the Vedic period: Aditi, mother of universe; Ushas, dawn; Nirritî, destruction;
and Vâc, speech. But most were devas, who competed among themselves, as
well as with the asuras, who seem to have been thought of first as their older
brothers and then later as their cousins. Both competed for territory, for female
companions (drawn from all kinds of beings), for shares from the sacrifices, and
for praise and reverence from worshippers (humans, animals, gods, and demons).
The devas and devîs occupied and, at least in the Vedic period, ruled the three
worlds: heaven (svar), mid-air (bhuvas), and earth (bhûr). The principal devas of
heaven were Dyaus, the sky god; Varuna, lord of rita; Mitra, lord of the day;
Pûshan, nourisher; and Vishnu, the pervader, or three-strider. The main devas of
the mid-air were Indra, lord of storm and war; Vâyu, lord of wind; the Maruts, war
rior lords; and Rudras, howlers and lords of killing fire. The greatest of the earthly
devas were Soma, lord of the plant soma, and Agni, lord of the sacrificial fire.
The evolution of the devas was already apparent in the Rigveda. Dyaus had
no real authority or role, only a faint memory of his past glory. The first triad
took shape in the middle period of the Vedas, with the heightened importance
of Sûrya, Indra, and Agni as rulers of the three domains. As the soma experience
of seeing and hearing the devas began to be referred to in ancient hymns, the
magical formulas of the prayers (mantras) and the science of control of the uni
verse through the Vedic sacrifices placed the priests (brâhmins) at the center of
the Vedic worldview. The devas and devîs multiplied, and the classifications of
divine beings expanded to include more and more classes. The gods were even
given a teacher, Brihaspati, the name of an ancient deva who was also known as
Brahmanaspati (lord of the prayers, or lord of ritual magic).
Creation myths appeared in the middle Vedic period, as did creators and pro
genitors, with mind-creation, creation by division, creation by coition, and so
forth. Some devas were given these roles: Pas ́upati (lord of the creatures; earlier
one of the Rudras), Purusha (the first being or man), Brahmânda (the cosmic egg),
Virât (the cosmic essence)
The sacrificial, or ritual, religion of the Brâhmanical, Epic, and Purânic peri
ods achieved order and control of the divine worlds by classification. A devo
tional revolution took place alongside this ritualism. Since its notion of the
divine involved something higher than the devas and devîs, a supreme lord of
the universe, these competing notions of divinity were able to be harmonized in
their literal expression. Both ritualism and devotionalism (bhakti) could accept
the myths, classifications, and iconography of the devas and devîs—only devo
tionalism maintained that all these divine beings were only manifestations of
the one supreme lord of the universe (whether seen as Sûrya, S ́iva, Vishnu, Devî,
Krishna, Râma, or others).
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 111



As the devas and devîs grew from 33 to 330,000,000 the threefold classifica
tion changed many times. The 33 presiding devas were the 12 (dvâdasha) âdityas,
the 11 (ekadasha) Rudras, the 8 (ashtha) Vasus, and the 2 As ́vins. Indra was their
chief. These 33 ruled over the 330,000,000 devas. One classification divided the
gods and goddesses into Âdityas, Vis ́vadevatas, Vasus, Tushitas, Âbhâsvaras, Ani
las, Mahârâjikas, Sâdhyas, Rudras, Vidhyâdharas, and Pitri-devas.
Further divisions added Apsaras, Virûpâkshas, Bhadras, Kinnaras, Gandhar
vas, Kumbhândas, Râkshasas, Nâgas, Ashvinîs, Kimpurushas, Pis ́âcas,
Guhyakas, Siddhas, Câranas, Matris, Kûshmândas, Bhûtas, and Vetâlas. Later
Purânic classifications even included Lokapâlas, Lipikas, Rishis, and Prajâpatis
as devas and devîs.
The devas could be classified with reference to Bhûtaganas like Prithvî or
different types of devatâs such as the Bhûdevatâs, Agnidevatâs, Vâyudevatâs,
and so on. Kubera was the presiding spirit of the Bhûdevatâs, Varuna of the
Jaladevatâs, Vâyubhagavân of the Agnidevatâs, and Indra of the Âkâshadevatâs.
Hindu polytheism gave control to the ritualist; focus and loyalty to the
devotionalist; a desire for unity to the philosopher or mystic; a sense of divinity
in everything to naturalist, farmer, and artist—a myriad of responses to a multi
leveled manifestation of divinity that no one could claim to totally comprehend.

DEVAKÎ
Daughter of a Yadu leader and mother of S ́rî Krishna
Devakî was said to be the rebirth of Aditi, the mother of the devas and wife of
Kas ́yapa-prajâpati. She was more famous as the mother of S ́rî Krishna. (Vishnu
pulled two hairs from his head, one white, another black, and implanted them
in the wombs of Rohinî and Devakî. Each divine fertilization became a full
incarnation of Vishnu.)
One account stated that Devakî held a svayamvara (the self-selection of her
husband by a ks ́atriya princess) in which she chose Vasudeva. At their marriage a
voice from heaven announced that her eighth child would kill Kamsa, her brother.
Kamsa drew his sword and would have killed her, had not her husband Vasudeva
pledged to give him each of the sons when they were born. So began intermittent
imprisonments of the couple and the killing of their first six sons, who were being
reborn to work out karma going all the way back to their sin of mocking the cre

ator.
Kamsa personally bashed the brains out of each baby boy. Kamsa’s rule of
Mathurâ became more and more evil. Some versions of the myth tell of the sev
enth child as an incarnation of Mâyâdevî. Even though the seventh birth was not
a boy, Kamsa tried to smash her head against the ground. But she rose into the
air and announced that Kamsa’s death was near.
Another version made Bala-Râma the seventh child. Devakî’s womb became
a divine way-station for Bala-Râma on his way to Rohinî to carry him until his
birth as the seventh avatâra of Vishnu. This makes these incarnations compli
cated theologically, since there were two full incarnations of Vishnu on earth at
one time.
Finally, Krishna was born as her eighth child, and in due course fulfilled the
prophecy that he would kill Kamsa.
Devakî’s rebirth as Prishnî, wife of Sutapas (a prajâpati, or progenitor),
seems to have been an example of inattention by the mythmaker. They placed
her back in time without any explanation of the karmic necessity for such a
story. Devakî had other such roles without development of character or purpose
except for the use of her name.

DEVAKULYÂ
Granddaughter of Sage Marîci
Devakulyâ washed the feet of Vishnu, and she was reborn as the river goddess
Gangâ. This myth had to be reconciled with another origin myth about the
Gangâ: that the earthly Gangâ came by the grace of S ́iva. The version featuring
Devakulyâ in the Bhâgavata Purâna emphasized her merit for worshipping
Vishnu and how she was rewarded with a rebirth as the river goddess Gangâ.
Devakulyâ’s rebirth as Gangâ exalted Vishnu and was noted in sectarian inter
pretations. But from universalist viewpoints both Vishnu and S ́iva were a part of
the One, and worship given to either honored both, and the Absolute as well.

DEVASENÂ
Woman of great beauty and purity
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 113



As a daughter of Daksha, a Prajâpati, Devasenâ could be considered a minor god
dess. In heavenly fields one day Devasenâ and her sister Daityasenâ were enjoy
ing nature when they caught the lustful eye of the demon Keshi. The demon
talked Daityasenâ into marrying him but could not persuade Devasenâ to do the
same. She prayed to Indra, who drove Keshi away with his diamond weapon
(vajrâyudha), but the demon escaped with the submissive sister. Devasenâ
asked for a husband who could defeat the devas (gods), dânavas (her half-broth
ers, sons of Danu, all demons), and yakshas (tree spirits). However, both Indra
and Brahmâ could not find such a warrior in the three worlds. All the gods com
bined were able to create Subrahmanya for her. Later with Devasenâ’s and Sub
rahmanya’s help the gods defeated the demons.
This myth was nested in the S ́iva myth cycle when Subrahmanya came to
be seen as a son of S ́iva and would need a worthy wife.

DEVAYÂNÎ
Daughter of S ́ukra, teacher of the asuras
Devayânî’s father, S ́ukra, was the greatest master of magic of his age, but he
served the asuras (demons). The devas (gods) sent Kaca to learn how S ́ukra made
the asuras invincible, and Kaca discovered that whenever the gods killed
demons, S ́ukra restored them to life.
Kaca caused Devayânî to fall in love with him, and through her learned the
magical power of mritasañjîvinî (giving life to the dead) from her father, S ́ukra.
But after Kaca mastered the training, he left without marrying Devayânî. So she
cursed him, so that what he learned would not be of use to him. Kaca cursed her
back that no deva would marry her.
After a very long time, King Yayâti, a mortal, married Devayânî, and she had
two sons by him named Yadu and Turvasu. Devayânî’s divine ancestry made her
a worthy wife for an eminent king of the lunar dynasty (candra-vams ́a), thus
legitimating this ruling line and giving it semi-divine status.

DEVÎ
A goddess; the Great Mother
Devî is a general term for all goddesses through all the periods of Hindu scrip
ture and mythology. As such, it can be added to the name of particular mothers,
sisters, wives, or lovers of male gods (devas). In India it is such a common prac
tice to be named after a god or goddess that the addition of deva or devî is help
114 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



ful for clarification.
As one individual goddess, Devî may be seen as subordinated to S ́iva as one
of his wives. Or, as Mahâdevî (the “great mother goddess”), she is S ́iva’s equal,
or she may even be held to be the supreme deity of the universe and the ultimate
source of everything that has life, consciousness, power, or activity. While
Mahâdevî’s ontological nature was addressed by India’s greatest philosopher
theologians, Devî’s complex and ambiguous mythology held much of India
under her spell. For specific information about each manifestation of Mahâdevî,
see details in particular entries for names mentioned in what follows.
Mahâdevî’s mythological cycle can gather all myths about devîs (goddesses)
within its wide embrace. From the most humble stone of a tribal image repre
senting a matrikâ (mother) to virgin goddesses (kumâris) to a myriad manifesta
tions of power (S ́haktî), her presence was perceived and worshipped as the Great
Mother. When subordinated as a wife and mother, her “cool” (orthodox) nature
manifested in beautiful, obedient wives such as Pârvatî for S ́iva, Lakshmî or  ́Srî
for Vishnu, and Sarasvatî for Brahmâ. But even myths about these fully Brâh
manical devîs—goddesses who have respectable places in orthoprax temples, fes

Devî manifests in many ways; here she kills yet more personifications of evil. (TRIP)



tivals, and rituals—may have reversals of gender roles and episodes that hint at
her possession of more power than her consort, at an alternate world order, and
even at another and more dangerous nature. For those who understand that
Mahâdevî’s s ́aktî was the source of all energy and the very life and activity of the
universe, the Mother was present even in the most sanitized myths of proper,
subservient, and inferior female goddess roles.
Any doubt about Mahâdevî’s status disappeared when her power was needed
to correct gods and men and turn them from their errant ways. Her five most
important manifestations (pañcadevîs) as Durgâ, Lakshmi, Sarasvatî, Sâvitrî,
and Râdhâ included three cool goddesses and two “hot,” or nonorthodox, ones.
Durgâ was dangerous as a slayer of evil, personified as a buffalo demon, Mahisha.
She drank wine before battle and decapitated her victims. Though beautiful and
seemingly ready to be married and to be brought under the control of a husband,
Durgâ reversed ordinary notions about the feminine. And Râdhâ, the earthly
consort of S ́rî Krishna, was only an earthly manifestation of Radhikâdevî, who
was the formless, eternal beauty more powerful than all the gods. As Râdhâ she
disregarded normal conventions and hinted that pleasure and power, not renun
ciation, were the divine reward of those who knew her play (lîlâ).
The hottest of all the manifestation of Mahâdevî is Kâlî. She was the anger
of Umâ, or Pârvatî, S ́iva’s wife. She has traditionally demanded offerings of wine,
meat, and blood. Animal sacrifices are still given to her at her temple in Cal
cutta, or in Nepal, or in the villages in non-orthoprax rituals. At the village level
any of the hot goddesses could be seen as Kâlî—Câmundâ, who drinks up the
blood of the demon Raktabîja (bloody seed), whose blood was the seed of more
demons, the Sapta-Mâtrikas (seven mothers), and even lesser goddesses of small
pox and disease like S ́îtalâ and Mâriyamman.
Pan-Indian festivals like Durgâ Pûjâ celebrate Durgâ’s great victories over
demons like Mahisha, and in local celebrations Mahâdevî might take possession
of male or female mediums, who speak with village wisdom and remind all of
her ever present and powerful nature. Everywhere that there is a river, especially
ones famous enough to have their own pan-Indian or even local myth, the god
dess is there too, as Gangâ, Sarasvatî, Tapatî, or Gomatî.

DHANVANTARI
A sage or deva (god)
After a thousand years of Churning of the Milky Ocean Dhanvantari arose with
a water-pot (kamandalu) in one hand and a staff (danda) in the other. He rose
above the water and worshipped Vishnu. He delivered the amrita, the drink of

immortality, which was supposed to be shared equally by devas and asuras
(demons). Vishnu promised him a wonderful rebirth.
So Dhanvantari was reborn to introduce the science of Âyurveda (the indige
nous medicine of India), after his earthly father-to-be, Dhanvâ, worshipped his
son-to-be as Abja-deva, the name Vishnu had given Dhanvantari as his divine
name. Dhanvantari taught his disciples the Âyurveda.

DHARMA
(1) A deva (god)
In the Vedas, Dharma was a metaphor, a personification of duty. In later periods,
however, Dharma was presented as a minor deva. Dharma was said to be born
from the right nipple of Brahmâ, the creator. In the Mahâbhârata Dharma was
given three sons: S ́ama, Kâma (god of love), and Harsha. In the Purânas Dharma
married thirteen daughters of Daksha-prajâpati: S ́raddhâ, Lakshmî (later to be
given to Vishnu), Dhritî, Tushtî, Medhâ, Pushtî, Kriyâ, Buddhî, Lajjâ, Vapus,
Santî, Siddhi, and Kirtî. Famous sons of Dharma were Hari, Krishna, Nara, and
Nârâyana. Hari and Krishna were great yogis, and Nara and Nârâyana were great
ascetics.
Dharma partially incarnated as Yudhishthira, eldest of the Pandavas and son
of Kuntî, when she received the boon of having children by different gods. In one
account, Dharma was reborn a mixed-caste human as Vidura, with the brâhmin
Vyâsa as his father and a s ́ûdra slave girl as his mother.
See also Brahmâ; Kâma; Kuntî
(2) A concept
This concept plays a major role in both Hindu mythology and religion. The word
itself came from the verbal root dhri, meaning “to sustain, support, uphold.”
The older concept used in the Rigveda is neuter in gender, dharman. But the
form of the word used in the following periods of mythology was masculine,
dharma.
There is no single word for religion in Sanskrit, perhaps because that realm
was so pervasive. The term dharma encompassed truth, tradition, teaching,
right action (ethics or morals), correctness (ought), duty, and obligation. It had
cosmic and social dimensions.
Its oldest connections were with the Vedic concept rita, the sustaining order
presided over by Varuna. That connected to truth (satya) and proper action.
Dharma developed within the tensions of Varuna’s rita and satya, Brâhmanical
(priestly) ritualism, and ks ́atriya (warrior) codes of ethics (honor, courage, and
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 117



loyalty). The myths demonstrate this tension in the struggles between gods and
demons, gods and humans, and gods and priests. Justice (rita) and truth (satya)
was universal but it was articulated indirectly in stories of misunderstandings,
failures, and conflicts.
Perhaps the most important connection was between dharma and the social
system, comprising two aspects, as ́ramas (stages) and varnas (castes). These
three, as as ́rama-varna-dharma, became inseparable for orthoprax Brâhmanical
society. For a more general discussion see the entries in Chapter 1, “Hindu
Worldviews” and “Dharma.”

DHRITARÂSHTHRA
Son of Ambika and the sage Vyâsa (credited with receiving the Vedas)
The lunar dynasty was in danger of dying out. Dhritarâshthra’s life story is an
illustration of just how weak dharma (truth, righteousness, religion) had become
on earth. Dhritarâshthra was the king under whose rule the great Mahâbhârata
war would be fought. Evil could not be reversed as the great royal lineage fought
amongst itself.
Dhritarâshthra’s conception compromised the great sage Vyâsa who was not
married to his mother, his resulting blindness disqualified him from being cho
sen king until there was no other choice, and his own past karma placed him on
the wrong side of the Mahâbhârata war. His story is nested in the actions of his
grandfather, his conception in his dead father’s name by a substituted mother
(and thus creating a glaring problem in the logic of his geneology), and his own
past actions. It is Hindu mythology at its best and most complicated—the use of
stories nested within stories illuminating right action through bad examples.
Dhritarâshthra’s grandfather, King S ́antanu, had sons by two wives, Gangâ
and Satyavâtî. Gangâ had been reborn on earth as part of a curse by Brahmâ for
exposing herself in heaven on one occasion. Gangâ threw seven of her eight sons
into the earthly river Gangâ and gave her eighth son, Bhîshma, to Satyavâtî to
raise alongside Satyavâtî’s own two sons, Citrângada and Vicitarvîrya. Bhîshma
took the vow of chastity (brahmavrata), so his half-brother, Citrângada, was
enthroned as the king. But he was killed on a hunting expedition by a gandharva.
At this point storytellers could provide their audience with an adult or a
children’s version. Vicitarvîrya was appointed king. Bhîshma abducted three
princesses from a neighboring kingdom. He sent one sister back and gave the
other two, Ambikâ and Ambalikâ, to Vicitarvîrya. Unfortunately Vicitarvîrya
also died before any children were born. The queen mother, Satyavâtî, solved the
crisis of an heirless throne by remembering that she had had a child by a brâh
118 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



min named Parâshara before she married King  ́Santanu. This son was none other
than Veda-Vyâsa. Satyavâtî brought Vyâsa into the palace and sent Ambikâ and
Ambalikâ, one after the other to Vyâsa so that they could produce heirs to the
throne. However, they were shocked by this rustic, according to polite accounts,
because he wore bark for clothes and had matted hair. Ambikâ was only able to
stay with Vyâsa by closing her eyes, so her son, Dhritarâshthra, was born blind.
Ambalikâ lost all her color when she saw the muni (wild one), and her son was
born a leper or, perhaps only an albino, named Pandu. Queen Satyavâtî’s maid
was very happy to be with Vyâsa and had a normal and highly intelligent child
who later became the great sage Vidura. Having done his duty, Vyâsa returned to
his hermitage (as ́rama). The lunar royal lineage had been temporarily saved.
Dhritarâshthra was passed over as king because of his infirmity—blindness.
Uncle Bhîshma helped arrange his marriage to a princess named Gândhârî, who
just happened to have a boon from S ́iva to be mother of a hundred sons. Vyâsa
was the instrument of S ́iva’s blessing. Gândhârî had remained pregnant for two
years, so she crushed her womb and forced out a lump of flesh. Vyâsa cut it into
a hundred pieces and kept them in butter (ghee) pots. Duryodhana was the eld
est son of the one hundred.
Pandu had become the king, but he was cursed by a hermit and died in the
forest. Yudhishthira, his eldest, became king but later lost the kingdom in a dice
game with Duryodhana. The Pandava brothers and their joint wife, Draupadî,
were forced into exile and, after the agreed upon thirteen years, returned to claim
the kingdom. However, Duryodhana would not return anything. So the hundred
Kaurava brothers led by Duryodhana and the five Pandava brothers and their
armies fought the great Bhârata war at Kurukshetra.
Dhritarâshthra opposed the war and was blessed with a moment’s sight by S ́rî
Krishna and was able to see his cosmic form (Vis ́varûpa). During the battle the
sage Sañjaya telepathically reported the events of the Bhagavad Gîtâ to Dhri
tarâshthra, who was again blind. After the great slaughter Dhritarâshthra and his
wife Gândhârî retreated to a hermitage near Kurukshetra. Great sages like Nârada
and Vyâsa visited them. Then Dhritarâshthra and Gândhârî along with the mother
of the Pandavas, Kuntî, went to Gangâdvâra and performed severe penance. They
died in a wildfire and entered the realm of Kubera, god of wealth and happiness.

DHRUVA
A great devotee to Vishnu
Dhruva was the son of the second wife of Manu, the first human. Manu’s first
wife and son treated Dhruva and his mother badly, yet they both accepted the
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 119



abuse with gentleness and humility. When he grew up, even though he was a
ks ́atriya (warrior), Dhruva joined a group of rishis (sages) and eventually became
one himself. He excelled in austerities (tapas), to the point that he worried Indra,
whose throne became hot from Dhruva’s efforts. Because of his devotion to
Vishnu, Dhruva was immortalized as the North Star.
Dhruva has been listed among the great devotees in Hindu mythology, like
Arjuna, Hanuman, and Prahalâda.

DIRGHATAMAS
A blind sage
The myths about Dirghatamas’s parentage varied widely; he was described as a
son of Kâsi-râja (according to the Mahâbhârata), of Uchâthya (in the Rigveda),
and of Utathya by Mamatâ (in the Purânas). But this brâhmin came to be seen
as having fathered a line of kings, so he inherited much more interesting
parental karma in another version in the Mahâbhârata.
One day Brihaspati, the ancient teacher of the devas (gods), was overcome
by passion for Mamatâ, his brother Utathya’s wife. Mamatâ was already preg
nant with Utathya’s child and tried to dissuade Brihaspati saying that she could
not hold the power of two sets of seeds at the same time. Utathya’s unborn child
had already mastered the Vedas. Brihaspati forced himself upon Mamatâ. Dur
ing intercourse, the child inside the womb told Brihaspati that what he was
doing was wrong and kicked the semen out of the womb with his foot. Brihas
pati became angry and cursed the unborn child to be born blind. So Utathya’s
child received the name Dirghatamas, which means “one who is in eternal dark
ness.”
Though blind, Dirghatamas equaled Brihaspati in brilliance. He married
Pradveshi and had many children by her. Then he became so contemptible in his
behavior toward his family that his wife and the members of their hermitage put
him into a raft to get rid of him. King Bali rescued the blind old sage (rishi) and
decided to have the sage produce brilliant children from his infertile queen. How
ever, she substituted a maid, with whom the old brâhmin produced eleven bril
liant children. Then the king discovered his wife’s deception and sent her back to
the old sage. The queen gave birth to five sons, who founded kingdoms with the
modern names of Bhâgalpura, Bengâl, Ândhra, Râjasâhi, and Tâmravika.

DRAUPADÎ
Wife of the five Pandava brothers
Draupadî was the princess of Pañcâla (thus her name Pâñcâlî) who held a contest
to choose her own husband (svayamvara). Arjuna competed in disguise because
he and his brothers had been exiled from their kingdom of Ayodhyâ. Arjuna, son
of Indra and Kuntî, won the contest and took her away with him. When he
announced to his mother that he had won a great prize, she declared that the
prize must be shared equally with his brothers as always. Thus, Draupadî
became the joint wife of the five Pandava brothers, although Arjuna always
remained her favorite.
Draupadî was treated as property in Yudhis·t ·hira’s famous gambling match
with Duryodhana and lost twice to him. The second time Dushshâsana, Duryo
dhana’s son, dragged Queen Draupadî into the Kauravas’ great assembly hall and
tried to disrobe her in front of her defeated husbands and the other members of
the palace. She was helped by Krishna and saved from humiliation as her sari
became unending. Draupadî vowed not to comb her hair until this humiliation
was avenged.
Back in the forest Draupadî did not complain as each of her husbands
acquired more wives and kept strange schedules. Bhîma honeymooned with
Hidimbî, his râkshasa bride, during the day and each night returned to be with
Draupadî. Arjuna went off for a year as a punishment for bursting into her bed
room when it was not his turn, acquiring wives and sons from his adventures.
During the exile she may have been raped by a kinsman, King Jayadratha. Then
she was so abused by a general named Kîcaka that Bhîma killed him and then
had to rescue Draupadî from being burned to death as punishment for that
killing.
Bhîma had vowed to avenge the humiliation of the Pandavas’ joint wife
Draupadî caused by Duryodhana. He finally kept that vow by mortally wound
ing Duryodhana with a blow from his war club.
On the eighteenth day of the Mahâbhârata war Draupadî and her five sons
visited the Pandava encampment, anticipating that the war was finally over.
That night Asvathâman and two warriors slaughtered most of the Pandava army,
including Draupadî’s five sons—one from each of her husbands. Draupadî
wanted revenge but allowed her husbands a way out of slaying a brâhmin. They
only had to bring back the jewel As ́vatthâma wore. Bhîma, Arjuna, and Krishna
pursued As ́vatthâma and brought back his jewel to Draupadî.
With the end of the war the Pandavas regained their kingdom, only to find
that they had no heart to continue as the royal family. When Yudhishthira, old
est of the Pandava brothers, renounced his kingdom and began the journey to the
Himâlayas, Draupadî and her other four husbands joined him. Draupadî died on
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 121



the way, but she was waiting in heaven (svarga) when Yudhishthira finally
arrived.
Draupadî has been honored as one of the pañca-kanyâ, the five ideal women
of Hinduism, being seen as one who lived her svadharma—all of life’s obliga
tions that she was responsible for observing.

DRONA
Son of a sage, and a warrior
Drona had a miraculous birth. His father, the brâhmin sage Bharadvâja, saw the
naked body of the beautiful apsara, Ghritâcî, who lost her clothes as she ran
from the mortal. Bharadvâja had a seminal discharge that was saved in a bucket
or trough, a drona, thus giving his son that name. Drona mastered archery and
taught both the Pandavas and Kauravas this martial skill.
Drona fought on the side of the Kauravas in the great Bhârata war, becom
ing their commander-in-chief upon the death of Bhîshma. He was killed when
he put down his weapons after being told the lie that his own son had been
killed. Drona was beheaded by the son of a king whom he had killed—even
though he was a brâhmin. It was written that he transported himself to heaven
because he had always fulfilled his dharma (duty).

DURGÂ
A goddess who killed Mahisha-asura (the buffalo demon)
The myths about Durgâ (the impassable) are like litmus paper. The paper indi
cates complete opposites (acid or alkaloid) as well as degrees of either. There are
several oppositions: Durgâ as beautiful, peaceful sister of Vishnu, wife of S ́iva, or
Durgâ as ferocious, powerful, avenging destroyer. Another opposition is Durgâ as
approved and Brâhmanical or Durgâ as heteroprax, left-handed, bloody, fully sex
ualized. Durgâ, the litmus paper, is the same. Some of her followers, S ́âktas, say
that she is the Parâdevî (the goddess as the Supreme). Some say Durgâ has mani
fested in sixty-four different forms (each appearing in many episodes), including
Ambikâ (mother), Dakshinâ (goddess of the ritual gift), Kâmâkshî (goddess of
love), Kâmadhenu (wish cow), Kâlî (goddess of time), Mûkâmbikâ (a horrific form
of Durgâ), Pârvatî (goddess of the mountain), Shivâ (goddess of sleep).
There are three living myths, more important than the rest, seen in her
images in temples, worshipped daily, or celebrated in her great festival, Durgâ
Pûjâ. All agree that she came as Mahâmâyâ (goddess of cosmic illusion, mystery,

magic) to slay the personifications of evil formed at creation from the very ear
wax of Lord Vishnu. As Vishnu slept these demons attacked the creative agent,
Brahmâ, who was saved by Durgâ’s decisive conquest of this outburst of evil. In
the brâhmanized form of her myth, Durgâ was produced by Vishnu. However,
this myth can also be read to indicate another reality. Durgâ, in S ́âkta texts and
their mythology, controlled Vishnu’s sleep, his yoganidrâ (yogic sleep after each
kalpa). She was the active energy (s ́aktî) of creation and the necessary power to
thwart evil.
Durgâ’s most important myth involved her combat with Mahisha-asura.
This powerful demon could not be killed by a male—not even by one of the
Trimûrti (Brahmâ, Vishnu, and S ́iva). In fact, Mahisha drove them from heaven
(svarga), ruling it for several centuries. Most accounts credited the gods with
combining all their powers to create a single being of light, a devî of celestial
beauty with eighteen arms. She rode her lion to the entrance way into heaven
(Devaloka, “place of the devas,” thus svarga) and proclaimed that she would
become the wife of anyone who could defeat her in armed combat. Mahisha fell
in love and was determined to have her. He sent his seconds, then his army, and
lastly himself. Finally he changed into his ferocious form as a buffalo demon, but
Durgâ cut off his head with a discus (Vishnu cakra). Iconographically, Durgâ,
with her lion and perhaps a decapitated Mahisha-asura nearby or underfoot, is
known as Mahisha-asura-Mardanî and Katyayanî with only ten arms.
The third myth about Kâlî springing from Durgâ’s forehead, personifying her
anger, has been used in some versions of the myths about Durgâ saving creation
and Durgâ killing Mahisha. The world again was threatened by evil—by the
demons S ́umbha and Nis ́umbha. Durgâ’s avenging energy, Kâlî, destroyed them.
Durgâ appears in many modern contexts. Perhaps her most famous devotee
was Shrî Râmakrishna, guru of Svâmî Vivekânanda. She is central to both
S ́aktism and S ́akta Tantrism, where her heteroprax worship involves blood sac
rifice, wine, and erotic rituals.

DURVÂSA
A sage
Durvâsa (hard to dwell) was known for his bad temper and his imperious ways.
He was also said to be a partial (amsha) incarnation of S ́iva.
Durvâsa has three different birth myths, each accounting for his character.
The first began in heaven. S ́iva had behaved so badly, abusing the devas (gods)
and his wife Pârvatî, that she decided to leave him. So S ́iva discarded that por
tion of himself that was making life miserable for everyone—to be born as a sage.
The rest of the story is told within the stories of S ́îlavatî, the woman who
stopped the sun from rising in order to reverse Durvâsa’s curse, and Anasûyâ, the
woman who gained a boon to have children from each of the Trimûrtis. In the
first version of Durvâsa’s birth Anasûyâ’s third child was the son of S ́iva—none
other than Durvâsa.
The second account of Durvâsa’s birth involved Brahmâ driving S ́iva from
heaven because of his sins. S ́iva begged the help of the rishi (sage) Nârâyana. S ́iva
was told to pierce the sage with his trident (shûla). Three streams of blood from
Nârâyana’s arm worked as a blood sacrifice: one stream went to heaven, another
into the skull carried by S ́iva, and the third became Durvâsa. Brahmâ was pla
cated, and S ́iva, now pure because of the blood sacrifice, returned to heaven. In
the third account S ́iva’s rage in a battle with demons came back to him as the
arrow that killed the demons and returned to his lap. That arrow was then born
as Durvâsa.
Was it any wonder then that, in the later mythology, Durvâsa served as a
fierce teacher, ready to chastise or curse any who crossed him. He made Krishna
and Rukminî pull his chariot like horses, beating them all the way. Then he
gave Krishna partial invincibility in battle, leaving only his foot unprotected.
And that of course turned out to be where the arrow that killed Krishna found
its mark. Durvâsa cursed kings and damsels, gave five magic mantras to Kuntî
so that she could have children by the gods, and spent lots of time in Indra’s
heaven.

DURYODHANA
The eldest of the Kaurava brothers and an arch villain
Duryodhana’s birth was a miracle from S ́iva, assisted by a blessing from Vyâsa.
(See account under Dhritarâshthra.) Duryodhana was raised in the palace of King
Pandu, who reigned because his blind brother Dhritarâshthra was disqualified by
his infirmity. When Pandu died, his oldest son Yudhishthira became king. Dury
odhana and his ninety-nine brothers had trained in the martial arts with their
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 125



five cousins, the sons of Pandu, or Pandavas. However, jealousy grew into hatred,
and Duryodhana turned into one of the arch villains of Indian literature and
myth. The sheer length of the Mahâbhârata, the world’s largest epic poem, pro
vided dozens of lengthy episodes that illustrated his deceit, cruelty, and malice.
Duryodhana was also a clever opponent of the Pandavas. On one occasion,
with the help of his uncle S ́akuni, Duryodhana led Yudhishthira into a gambling
match that ended with the loss of his kingdom and even of the wife he shared
with his brothers, Draupadî. Dushshâsana, Duryodhana’s son, dragged Queen
Draupadî (also know as Pâñchâlî after her birthplace) into the Kauravas’ great
assembly hall and tried to disrobe her in front of her defeated husbands and the
other members of the palace. She was helped by Krishna and was saved from
humiliation. It was the miracle of the unending sari.
The Pandava brothers and their joint wife Draupadî were forced into exile
and after the agreed-upon thirteen years returned in the fourteenth to reclaim
the kingdom, but Duryodhana refused to give it up. So the hundred Kaurava
brothers, led by Duryodhana, and the five Pandava brothers assembled their
armies. Duryodhana asked Krishna to join on his side, but Krishna gave him the
choice: either Krishna or his army. Duryodhana took the army, and Krishna
joined the Pandavas as Arjuna’s chariot driver. The battle involved great slaugh
ter, but it eventually went badly for the Kauravas. On the eighteenth day they
were routed, and Duryodhana fled the field of battle and hid in a lake. He had
the miraculous power of surviving under water. He was discovered and forced
to fight in single combat with Bhîma, the giant Pandava. Duryodhana was win
ning, but Bhîma, remembering his vow to avenge Draupadî’s humiliation,
struck Duryodhana below the waist, a dishonorable act. Duryodhana was left to
die, but three of his army found him—the very last survivors of his great army.
That night the survivors went into the Pandava camp, murdering many and
bringing back the heads of five Pandava grandchildren. Duryodhana mistook
these for the heads of the five brothers whom he so hated. He asked for the head
of Bhîma and when he found that he was able to crush it, he knew the decep
tion. His dying words condemned the loss of life of innocents. He had died a
“good fighter” (suyodhana).
One interesting reversal came at the end of the story of Yudhishthira’s long
quest to reach heaven. Yudhishthira found that Duryodhana, his enemy and
cause of so much of his and others’ suffering, had reached heaven years before.
Duryodhana had done his duty (dharma) and for so doing had been granted his
place with Brahmâ.

DUSHYANTA
A king of the mythical Puru dynasty
King Dushyanta was on a hunting expedition in the forest when he found a
woman of extraordinary beauty named S ́akuntalâ. She had been raised by an old
sage named Kanva in his forest hermitage. However, S ́akuntalâ had another sage
as her father, the famous Vis ́vâmitra, who had begotten her after being seduced
by an apsara (celestial damsel) named Menakâ. Vis ́vâmitra went in shame to the
Himâlayas where he did penance for a thousand years, leaving S ́akuntalâ to be
raised by Kanva.
Dushyanta fell in love with S ́akuntalâ and took her in gândharva marriage,
as the kind of marriage formed without any Brâhmanical ritual was called.
S ́akuntalâ managed to get two promises from Dushyanta before he returned to
his palace: that if she had a son that son would become the next king and that
Dushyanta would send for her upon his return to the palace. When old Kanva
returned to the as ́rama, he knew psychically the whole story and blessed S ́akun
talâ that her unborn son would in fact become king.
In the meantime, King Dushyanta had offended the irritable old sage
Durvâsa, who cursed Dushyanta with loss of memory. After six years S ́akuntalâ
stopped waiting and took her son to the palace. However, Dushyanta did not rec
ognize her or remember anything. They argued until a celestial voice told
Dushyanta the truth. Then the king relented, and their son, Sarvadamana, was
accepted and later ruled under the name of Bharata.

EKALAVYA
Disciple of Drona-acarya
This is a myth that sets unusual talent against dharma (the moral order), in this
case the duty of accepting the restrictions of one’s caste. The master (acarya)
Drona was a brâhmin who refused to teach one who was not twice-born. Drona
taught the Pandavas and the Kauravas to be great archers, but unknowingly he
prepared them to fight each other in the great Bharata war.
Dronacharya had not accepted Ekalavya as his disciple because he belonged
to a lower caste. Ekalavya made an idol of Drona, worshipped it, and started
learning the lessons of the great sage without his knowledge. Arjuna learned
that Ekalavya was as skillful as he in archery. He went to Drona and asked how
could this have happened, when Drona had already announced that Arjuna was
the best in archery. Ekalavya was questioned and confessed that he had learned
the lessons without Drona’s knowledge. Drona accepted Ekalavya as his disci
ple. Then Drona asked for guru-dakshina, the token payment given to the
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 127



teacher. Drona asked for Ekalavya’s right thumb, which he cut off and gave to
the guru.
This is a cruel myth, illustrating that one must follow one’s own dharma
(svadharma) rather than someone else’s. It taught a very rigid application of the
Brâhmanism of the law books (the Dharma S ́âstras and Dharma Sutras): one’s
life was already defined by birth and stage of life (varna-as ́rama-dharma). As a
student, Ekalavya had to obey his teacher. And without his right thumb, he no
longer could strive to become a warrior (ks ́atriya).

EKAVÎRA
A king born from horses
In the days when gods and goddesses changed into horses, and their offspring
became human kings, Ekavîra was born and founded the Hehaya dynasty. The
myth began in Vaikuntha (Vishnu’s heaven). A friend of Indra, King Revanta,
came to the abode of Vishnu and Lakshmî. Lakshmî was infatuated with the
handsome Revanta. She flattered him by complimenting the beauty of his horse.
Because her attention was on Revanta, she did not hear what Vishnu was saying.
Vishnu became angry at Lakshmî’s behavior and cursed her to be born as a mare.
Lakshmî begged for some way to do penance. So Vishnu stated that she would
be redeemed from the curse and would get back her original nature once she gave
birth to a son that equaled the glory of Vishnu himself. The rest of the myth
unraveled this puzzle: how a mare could possibly do that.
Once on earth, Lakshmî prayed to S ́iva and Pârvatî for help, which, after a
thousand years of her devotion, they promised to give. S ́iva went to Vaikuntha
and sent Vishnu to earth as a horse. Other versions take this superiority away
from S ́iva by simply having Vishnu miss Lakshmî and follow her to earth as a
stallion. Either way, there was a time of deva-lîlâ, divine play. When a child was
born, Vishnu and Lakshmî returned to Vaikuntha, leaving little Hehaya (“born
of a horse”—the future Ekavîra) alone in the forest. Divine beings, Vidyâdharîs
and Lakshmî-Nârâyanas, finally got him to the right parent, King Shatajit, who
had been praying for a son. He named the infant Ekavîra, raised him, and even
tually gave him his kingdom so that he and his queen could retire to the forest
and gain heaven. After some years of penance (tapas), they attained Vishnuloka
(another name for Vishnu’s heaven).
Ekavîra found his wife by retrieving her from hell (pâtâla). He was wander
ing in the forest and came upon a weeping damsel. She told the story of a child
less royal couple who had produced a beautiful daughter by performing a magic
ritual (putrakâmeshthi yâga). They named her Ekâvalî and planned to marry her
128 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



to Ekavîra, king of Hehaya. However, a demon kidnapped her, and when she
would not submit to his desires, the demon Kâlaketu imprisoned her in hell.
Ekavîra went to Pâtâla, defeated Kâlaketu in mighty combat, and brought both
Ekâvalî and the damsel who had told him her story, Yashovatî, who was really
the princess’s lady-in-waiting, back to her father’s palace. The king of Raibhya
was so pleased that he gave them both to King Ekavîra, who returned to his king
dom of Hehaya and founded a great dynasty there.

GANAPATI
A title or concept
Most Hindus see Ganapati as an alternative name for Ganes ́a, the elephant
headed son of S ́iva. Ganapati, literally “father of the ganas (groups),” was a title
or concept that first appeared in the Rigveda. During the Vedic period ganas
were the metrical groups, each of which had three syllables. The eight ganas rep
resented all the metrical combinations of long and short syllables. A father of
these metrical groups, a ganapati, would be a master of the Vedas themselves.
By the time of the Aitareya Brâhmana, father of the ganas had become a title
of Brahmâ, father of these Vedic meters. Brahmâ was also called Brahmanaspati,
father of the commentaries, and Brihaspati, father of Brihat (the Vast), a title
appropriated from Varuna. As father of the groups Brahmâ was not the leader of
dwarfs or demons but the patron deity of the lists of the sacred words that were
the vocabulary of Vedic schools. Brahmâ was the lord of wisdom who helped
priests memorize the hymns and recite the prayers in the sacred meters. Two
Vedic sages were also said to father ganas: Prâtishâkhyas and Yâska.
Sometimes mythology has layers of evidence, like archaeology. In the
Ganes ́a myth cycle there seems to be clear evidence that the title lord or father
of the ganas was still linked to the metrical groups. Vyâsa dictated the entire
Mahâbhârata with Ganes ́a, lord of the ganas, as his scribe. Ganes ́a used his sin
gle tusk as the stylus that marked green palm leaves with Vyâsa’s verses. Ganes ́a
was lord of the sacred words of scripture.
The second meaning of gana as “association” would put Ganes ́a in charge
of a host of associates of his father, S ́iva. He was entrusted to lead S ́iva’s army of
Ganas, now a class of dwarfs. With this association with S ́iva’s friends of the cre
mation grounds, Ganapati, now firmly identified with Ganes ́a, acquired the dual
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 129



dimensions of benevolence and danger that has attracted such devotion to him
in Hindu mythology and religion. Those who worship Ganes ́a as Ganapati exclu
sively are known as Ganapatyas; they worship him sometimes as clan deity
(kuladevata), sometimes as personal lord (ishtadevatâ).

GANDAKÎ
A river of Purânic fame
This myth was included in the Skanda Purâna as an elaboration on the myth of
the Churning of the Milky Ocean, in which Vishnu appeared as Môhinî and
tricked the asuras (demons) out of the nectar of immortality. The moral purpose
of this myth is not clear. It does extend the notion that rivers are sacred.
Vishnu had taken the form of a beautiful woman called Môhinî that had
appeared when the Milky Ocean was churned, which had been stolen by the
demons. S ́iva wanted to see this form of Vishnu and persuaded Vishnu to appear
again as Môhinî. Upon seeing her great beauty S ́iva made love to Môhinî. The
sweat that was produced during their love play fell down and turned into a river
called Gandakî.

GÂNDHÂRÎ
Wife of King Dhritarâshthra
In the Mahâbhârata, Gândhârî had the quite traditional roles of daughter, wife,
and mother. Even though her sons, the hundred Kauravas, proved to be on the
wrong side of righteousness, she was an example of one who practiced sva
dharma, meeting the requirements of her caste and of the stages of life.
Gândhârî was the daughter of King Subala of Gândhâra, receiving a name
referring to her birthplace. She was married to King Dhritarâshthra, even though
he was blind—because of Dhritarâshthra’s lineage and power. Gândhârî accepted
her father’s choice and literally wedded blindness. From the day they married,
she wore a blindfold until her death. She did not wish to see the world that her
husband could not see. She gave birth to a hundred sons, the eldest being Dury
odhana, and a daughter, their youngest child, named Dussalâ. Their birth was
made possible by divine powers (siddhis) associated with the sage Vyâsa. (For
more on these births, see the entry on Duryodhana.)
Gândhârî’s brother, S ́akuni, was an evil influence on her sons. He trained
the Kauravas in dark magic that gave them power to win by deceit. Duryodhana
was his best pupil in cheating at dice. Gândhârî was not able to counter these

male influences. When the Bharata war finally ended with the death of all her
sons, Gândhârî wanted to curse the Pandavas. However, old Vyâsa reminded
Gândhârî of her blessing at the beginning of the war: that victory should go to
the side of righteousness. She realized that the deeds of Duryodhana, S ́akuni, and
others had been justly punished. She did, however, curse Krishna, whom she
held responsible for everything: her curse was that all his heirs should be killed
and that even he would die by deceit. This curse was said to be the cause of
Krishna’s death from a poisoned arrow of a hunter that hit him in the foot—the
only place where he was not protected. (For more on Krishna’s partial invulner
ability, see the entry on Durvâsa.)
After the death of all her sons in the battle at Kurukshetra, Gândhârî retired
into the forest and stayed in a hermitage (as ́rama). Because of her austerities
(tapas), Vyâsa came and granted her wish to see her sons and relatives again
before she died. After she had bathed in the Gangâ, all her dead relatives
appeared on the shore. Two days later she died in a forest fire, along with her
husband, and their companion Kuntî, mother of the Pandavas.

GANDHARVAS
A class of devas (gods)
This class of gods appeared first in the Vedic period. They were sky beings, asso
ciated with the preparation of soma. The Atharvaveda said that there were 6,333
gandharvas. They liked mortal women and sported with them, using their pow
ers to shape-shift and fool all but the most disciplined of wives. There were,
however, a number of great heroines whose austerities (tapas) were a match for
the magic powers (siddhis) of the gandharvas. In later mythology they were said
to be children of the progenitor, or grandfather, named Kas ́yapa-prajâpati, by his
wife Arishthâ. An appendix to the Mahâbhârata, the Harivamsa, stated that
they came from Brahmâ’s nose. They were adept at music and were known as
the heavenly musicians.
Gândharva marriage was one of the six forms of marriage. It could be a love
marriage or a seduction, even a seduction by force—getting its name from the
gandharvas’ example. Even under the best of circumstances, gândharva marriage
was not blessed by the sacrament (samskâras) of Brâhmanical ritual.

GÂNDÎVA
The bow of Arjuna
The distance between gods and heroes in Purânic mythology was not very great.
Divine weapons, like the Gândîva, the great bow of Brahmâ, could be given to
mere mortals, since the mortals were so often partial divine incarnations or from
mixed marriages between gods and mortal women. Such was the case with
Arjuna who did not have a human father, as he was born of Indra (god of war) and
Kuntî.
The Gândîva was made by Brahmâ. He kept the Gândîva for 1,000 years and
then passed it on to Prajâpati (a “grandfather”) who kept it for another 1,000
years. From Prajâpati the Gândîva went to Indra who used it for 3,585 years.
Indra gave it to Candra (the moon), who had kept it for another 500 years and
then gave it to Varuna, who used it for 100 years. Varuna gave the Gândîva to
Arjuna. Arjuna used it for 65 years.
The Gândîva was famous for having the power to punish evil and wicked
people. It made its user capable of fighting against one lakh (100,000) of warriors
at a time. The Gândîva was also an object of worship for devas (gods), asuras
(demons), and humans.
When the Kurukshetra war ended, the Yâdava dynasty declined rapidly, and
even Krishna was killed. The Pandavas lost interest in ruling their kingdom.
Parîkshit, grandson of Arjuna, was appointed king. The Pandavas started their
journey (mahâprasthana) of renunciation toward heaven. On the way, Arjuna
gave back the Gândîva to Varuna by throwing it, along with the quiver of divine
arrows, into the sea, Varuna’s abode.

GANES ́A
Son of S ́iva; a god
Ganes ́a’s mythology came to be nested within that of S ́iva and Pârvatî. The
theriomorphic past, where animals are gods, has been sufficiently sanskritized
and brâhmanized for Ganes ́a, with all his associations as Ganapati, leader of the
dwarf demons of S ́iva, to become pan-Indian, losing ancient tribal and regional
origins. Ganes ́a even transcended his association with S ́iva, for all Indians are
likely to have his image in their business or on a family shrine.
132 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



The most important features of his mythology involve his birth story, how
he came to have an elephant’s head, how he received the power to remove obsta
cles, and how he became the god of wealth.
An account in the Linga Purâna gave one version of his origin. The asuras
and the râkshasas performed sacrifices and austerities and received a boon from
S ́iva by which they were able to defeat the devas (gods) in battle. Indra and the
other gods complained to S ́iva and prayed that he would create an obstacle for
the asuras and râkshasas. S ́iva created from himself a being, Vighneshvara, the
lord of obstacles, who would place all sorts of objects in the way of the asuras
and râkshasas and frustrate their attempts to gain merit from their sacrifices and
austerities, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of their boon. Vighneshvara
came from S ́iva’s amshas, a part of his power, that was placed in the womb of
Pârvatî. As soon as Vighneshvara was born, he obstructed the wicked and aided
the righteous.
The account of Vighneshvara’s birth in the S ́iva Purâna acknowledged other
versions but utilized an interesting device to both affirm them and give a new
version, saying that in different ages (kalpas) of creation there have been differ
ent origins of Vighneshvara. Then it continued to tell about the origin of Vigh
neshvara in the S ́veta-kalpa (a long ago cosmic age). In that kalpa Pârvatî’s
companions, Jayâ and Vijayâ, tried to convince her that she needed her own ser
vant. And when S ́iva intruded into her bath, she decided to create a gate-keeper
(dvârapâlaka) from a little dirt from her skin. In so doing, she created a formi
dable being, Vighneshvara. The next time that S ́iva attempted to burst in upon
his wife, Vighneshvara prevented him—even driving him away with a cane that
left a few cuts on S ́iva. Furious, S ́iva sent his Bhuta-ganas (demons), who were
also promptly defeated. The gods, including Vishnu, tried to gain S ́iva’s favor by
defeating this upstart. Pârvatî saw the gods ganging up on her son and sent two
fierce goddesses to help with magic. They protected Vighneshvara from injury by
using mâyâ (“magic,” “illusion”) to misdirect the aim of the god’s weapons.
Then Vishnu, lord of mâyâ, confused the goddesses, and they returned to Pârvatî.
At that moment S ́iva attacked Vighneshvara and easily cut off his head. Of
course, the meddling sage Nârada appeared to tell Pârvatî about the death of her
son, and Pârvatî created a thousand fighting goddesses to punish the slayers. The
gods were suffering pitifully, so Nârada and other sages raced to Pârvatî and
begged that she end her revenge. This she did as soon as her son was brought
back to life.
In all versions of this myth, S ́iva sent attendants to find a head, and one of
a dead elephant was brought back. That head had only one tusk (eka-danta) and
would make Vighneshvara into the elephant-faced god (gajânana), Ganes ́a.
When Pârvatî saw her restored son, she took him before the assemblage of gods,
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 133



presided over by her husband S ́iva, and presented her son. S ́iva promptly apolo
gized to all and gave Ganes ́a command of his demon forces (ganas), acquiring a
role that gained him the title Ganapati. Thus this version accounted for the ori
gin of Vighneshvara, Gajânana, Ekadanta, and Ganapati, all different names of
Ganes ́a, without compromising S ́iva as Lord of Yoga, asceticism. He was both
father of Vighneshvara and still chaste.
Three Purânas offered another version (Varâha, Matsya, and Skanda Purânas).
This version made Vighneshvara a material aid in the operation of karma. The gods,
immortals, and sages noticed that both good and bad actions involved the same
effort. So they went to Kailâsa and asked Lord S ́iva to create some force that would
make bad actions more difficult. While S ́iva was contemplating their request, he
looked at his wife Pârvatî, and that look produced a radiant youth with all of S ́iva’s
âkâshic (psychic) qualities. But Pârvatî (referred to in these works by her other
name, Umâ) was excited by S ́iva’s creation and cursed their son so that he would
not become a temptation for all the female inhabitants of heaven. She cursed him
with an elephant’s head and a huge belly. Even so, S ́iva gave him his names: Ganes ́a
Vinâyaka (the guide, the remover), Vighnarâja (king or lord of obstacles), Son of S ́iva,
Chief of the Vinâyakas (guides) and of the ganas (demons), Ganapati.
134 Handbook of Hindu Mythology
Ganes ́a, son of S ́iva, is worshipped for protection and as giver of wealth and remover of
obstacles. (TRIP)



One of the alternate versions involved Parasu-Râma. Ganapati was guarding
the entrance to Kailâsa while his father S ́iva was sleeping. Meanwhile the sage
Paras ́u-Râma came there and tried to go inside. When he was continuously
denied entrance by Ganapati, Parasu-Râma cut off one of Ganapati’s tusks.
Thereafter he had only half a tusk on his right side.
Ganapati has a prominent place among Hindu deities as the god who
removes all obstacles. This is a natural extension of his strength as an elephant.
He is worshipped as Vignesvara, the remover of all obstacles. A puja (ritual wor
ship) is done to him by breaking a coconut at the garba griha (inner sanctuary)
of the temple. Any activity should begin with a prayer to Vignesvara to remove
all the obstacles in the way of accomplishing it. The form of Ganapati with his
huge ears, trunk, and big belly is philosophically interpreted by Hindus as sym
bolizing openness of mind for acute receptivity and alertness.
In temple images, Ganapati (Ganes ́a) is most often found in ensembles with
S ́iva and Parvatî. He has a large rat for his vehicle and, in many images, one bro
ken tusk. His image is almost obligatory for businesses, since he has become the
god of wealth.

GANGÂ
A river goddess
Gangâ is the holiest river of India. She is the Mother who washes away all sins
and redeems one from the fetters of life. There are many folk songs about the
Gangâ, which testify just how much the river has been personified, deified, and
made an integral part of Hindu spiritual life.
The origin of river Gangâ is connected with the avatâra (incarnation) of
Vishnu as Vâmana. When Vâmana measured the three worlds, the nail of his left
foot caused a hole in the upper side of heaven’s shell. From that hole, Gangâ orig
inated and fell into heaven. The point of her origin is called Vishnupadî. For a
long time Gangâ remained in the heavens. The spot where she originated on
earth is called Dhruva-mandala, since the sage Dhruva did austerities (tapas)
there for many years, resulting in the Gangâ’s descent to earth.
The seven Rishis, who are the sages that begin each cosmic age, continually
take their holy baths in the Gangâ. The holiness of the Gangâ is described in
scripture (such as the Mahâbhârata and the Agni Purâna). Even today, in spite
of its polluted water, a dip in the Gangâ is believed to remove all sins and bless
one with heaven. The festival of Kumbhamela (celebrated every twelve years) is
attended by many tens of thousands of people to offer their worship (pujas) to
Mother Gangâ.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 135



The heavenly Gangâ prepares to flow to earth through S ́iva’s matted locks. (TRIP)



The descent of the celestial Gangâ to earth is described in the Bhâgavata
Purâna. Many of the names are mythical, referring to heavenly regions and
sacred geography. Gangâ originated from Vishnupâda (the foot of Vishnu) and
flowed to devayâna (literally, the way of the Gods). From devayâna it descended
to Candramandala. From Candramandala, Gangâ divided into four tributaries
called Sîtâ, Cakshusa, Alakanandâ, and Bhadrâ, and then fell into Brahmaloka
(Brahma’s land in heaven). It fell in various directions from Brahmaloka. Of the
four tributaries, Sîtâ fell on the head of Mount Meru and then flowed down to
earth around Gandhamâdana, went around Bhadrâsvavarsa, and emptied into the
eastern sea. Cakshusa fell on Mount Mâlyavân, went around the land of
Ketumâla, and emptied into the western sea. Alakanandâ fell on Mount Hema
kuta, flowed around the land of Bharatavarsa (India), and emptied into the south
ern sea. Bhadrâ fell on Mount Sringavân, flowed around the land of Uttarkuru,
and emptied into the northern sea.
One myth connected the river goddess Sarasvatî with Gangâ. Vishnu was
talking to his three wives: Lakshmî, Sarasvatî, and Gangâ. During the conversa
tion Gangâ passed playful glances toward Vishnu behind the backs of Sarasvatî
and Lakshmî. Sarasvatî saw this and became very annoyed. She got up and
started beating Gangâ. A fight raged between them. Meanwhile Lakshmî tried to
intervene. Disliking her intervention Sarasvatî cursed Lakshmî to be born on
earth. Gangâ cursed Sarasvatî in return to be born as a river on earth. Sarasvatî
immediately cursed Gangâ back to be born on earth as a river too. At this junc
ture Vishnu pacified all three wives but said that the curses had to have their
effects and could not be taken back. Lakshmî was born as the Tulasi plant
(Ocsimum Sanctum) in the as ́rama of the sage Dharmadvaja and grew up as his
daughter. An asura (demon) named Sankhachuda who was a partial incarnation
of Vishnu married her. In due course she became a river called Padmavatî. As the
Padmavatî River, Lakshmî left her earthly form and returned to Vaikuntha
(Vishnu’s heavenly abode). Gangâ was led to earth by the prayers of King Bhagî
ratha and became a mighty river. She married a king called Santanu and gave
birth to the Ashtavasus (eight Vasus who were attendants to Indra). After their
birth she returned to Kailâsa and became the spouse of S ́iva. Sarasvatî became a
river on earth, and, leaving her mortal form there, went to Brahmaloka and
became the spouse of Brahma. This version was given in the Bhâgavata Purâna.
Many other versions are told, including the one when the Gangâ flows to earth
from S ́iva’s matted hair.

GARUDA
The king of birds and the celestial vehicle of Vishnu
Garuda, or Garutman, as he was known in the Vedas, was appropriated in the
devotional myths of the epic and Purânic periods as the servant vehicle of Lord
Vishnu. The name Garuda has as its verbal root gri (to speak). In the Vedas
Garuda is the metaphor for, or, for those who would literalize these concepts,
the personification of, the magical words (mantra, rik). Thus it was on Garuda’s
wings that one was transported to the realm of the gods (either the mantras or
“the self,” which could be understood metaphorically as either the subtle realm
where the mantras had their origin or as the Self, the deepest level of conscious
ness and of all reality). Before Garuda was completely literalized, Vishnu rode as
his vehicle (vâhana) on rhythms (rik), sounds (sâman), and sacrifices (yâjña),
the components of Vedic ritual. Garuda’s role in another mythology, the cult of
Sûrya (sun) as the Supreme, has left few traces except its late reconstruction at
the great sun temple at Konâraka.
In Purânic mythology Garuda myths abound. The vehicle of Lord Vishnu
had a great birth, worthy deeds, and supreme powers. His birth stories all
attested to his importance, even though they were otherwise inconsistent. One
version had him born on the basis of the great austerities (tapas) of his mother,
Vinatâ. Both she and her rival, Kadrû, were given boons by their husband
Kas ́yapa-Prajâpati. Kadrû chose to have a thousands sons, the nâgas (snakes), and
they hatched first. Vinatâ chose only to have two sons, but ones greater than
Kadrû’s. In her impatience Vinatâ opened one of her two eggs and brought Aruna
(the red one) half-hatched into the world. Aruna cursed his mother with servi
tude and left to become Sûrya’s charioteer. (For more, see the entry on Aruna.
Note here another connection between Garuda and Sûrya. Garuda was born from
the second egg and then served the god who appropriated Sûrya’s powers and
attributes as a solar deity, Vishnu.)
Kadrû (the vessel for soma) and Vinatâ (personification of bowing to knowl
edge) are literalized as rival wives. These personifications sanskritize the myth
and turn Vedic concepts into goddesses. Vinatâ became the humiliated servant
of Kadrû, helping tend her sons.
Other versions told of Garuda as the product of Kas ́yapa’s practices (yâjñas)
combined with the magical practices (yâga-s ́aktî) of the Bâlakhilyas, a class of
tiny divine sages, each the size of a thumb. They gave their accumulated merit
138 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



to Kas ́yâpa to have a son who would defeat Indra. Garuda was the result: so bril
liant that he hurt the gods’ eyes and worshipped by them mistakenly as Agni.
Garuda was a shape-changer, going wherever he pleased, stopping the rotation of
the worlds with the wind from his wings, with eyes of fire, and an enemy of
snakes.
At this point the mythic versions merged. Garuda had to free his mother
from the tyranny of Kadrû and her nâga children. A bargain was made for an
exchange of the pot of divine nectar (amrita) for his mother’s freedom. Garuda
flew to heaven, fought the devas (gods), blinding them with a sandstorm from
his great wings and taking the pot of amrita. He so impressed Vishnu that
Vishnu granted him a boon of immortality. Garuda pledged that he would serve
Vishnu and become his vehicle. Indra and Garuda fought again, and a respect
arose between the two heroes after their combat. Garuda told Indra why he had
stolen the pot of amrita, not for himself but to save his mother. He told Indra to
follow and steal it back from the nâgas. Then he flew to their kingdom,
exchanged the pot for his mother, and flew away. Garuda had told them that
they must be pure before drinking the nectar of immortality. So, while the nâgas
took a bath, Indra stole the amrita and took it back to the devas. The nâgas
licked the darbha grass where the pot had been placed, and the sharp grass split
their tongues.
More Garuda myths abound, both about the great eagle alone and as
Vishnu’s servant vehicle. He made an interesting mythological appearance in
the royal symbolism of Buddhist Thailand, where, as the sun eagle, he repre
sented royal power and divine approval.

GAUTAMA
One of the seven sages (sapta-rishis)
There were references to Gautama’s name in the Rigveda. In a hymn that was
later literalized, Indra as a metaphor of the morning carried off night. Indra’s
character became that of a seducer of sages’ wives, and Ahalyâ (“unplowed”), the
wife of Gautama, became one of them.
The number of versions of the seduction of Ahalyâ showed how many ways
it could be utilized in Purânic mythology. (For another version see the entry on
Ahalyâ). In a version where Ahalyâ was innocent, Indra came to the âshrâma,
was given fruit by Ahalyâ, and left without harming her. But the old rishi Gau
tama returned, assumed she was guilty, ordered his son to cut off her head, and
went back into the forest. Cirakâri sat down and pondered dharma (in the form
of his duty to obey his father) and karma (in the form of the offense of killing his

astray with false teachings. (TRIP)



mother). Fortunately, Cirakâri was not quick of mind, and his father had time to
return in a better frame of mind and bless him for his thoughtfulness.
Gautama was given so many roles of blessings and cursings in the Purânas
(cursing Ahalyâ, cursing Indra, blessing King Kalmâshapâda, blessing Dyumat
sena, and so on) that one might not be wrong in concluding that he was a per
sonification of the complex logic of the curse and the blessing.

GAVIJÂTA
Son of a sage, who cursed a king
In the Devî Bhâgavata the sage Nâgabhushana (“one having snakes as his orna
ment,” a sage whose name was a pun, pointing to the object of the story, S ́iva)
was deep in meditation at his forest hermitage. King Parîkshit, grandson of
Arjuna, came to him desiring water after a long hunt. But Nâgabhushana did not
respond. Parîkshit put a dead snake on the sage’s neck, but there was still no
response. The king returned to the palace thirsty. Nâgabhushana’s son, Gavijâta,
was teased by companions that his father really was “one having dead snakes as
his ornament.” The son immediately cursed the one who had done this to be bit
ten by the king of snakes, Takshâka, and die within seven days. When Gavijâta
learned what the king’s provocation had been, he went to the king and warned
him of the curse so that there might be countermeasures. But Parîkshit stated
that he was ready to die when the time for death came.

GHANTA-KARNA, GHANTÂKANTA
Râkshasa (demonic) brothers
Ghanta and Karna were brothers in some sources, but the older râkshasa was
called by both names, Ghantâkanta, as the myths were about him. Ghanta’s
myth was nested within several others and modified in sectarian versions com
peting over who was the supreme deity, S ́iva or Vishnu.
Ghantâkarna came into being because S ́iva had to create a terrible demon to
correct a misuse of a boon that he had granted to Mandodarî, wife of a demon
named Dâruka. The story goes like this: Dâruka had done austerities (tapas) in
order to gain a boon from Brahmâ and then used it to make life miserable for the
devas (gods). They in turn sought relief from S ́iva, who created Bhadrakâlî from
his third eye. Bhadrakâlî killed Dâruka and left his wife Mandodarî grieving.
Mandodarî then did severe tapas and won a gift from S ́iva, some drops of sweat
from his body. S ́iva told her that these drops would cause smallpox to anyone
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 141



upon whom they were sprinkled. So of course the demoness Mandodarî, as god
dess of smallpox, made her first victim Bhadrakâlî. As Bhadrakâlî suffered from
a life-threatening case of smallpox, S ́iva created the râkshasa Ghantâkarna to
help her. Ghantâkarna had the power (s ́aktî) to lick the smallpox from her body.
However, Bhadrakâlî stopped him before he licked her face, pointing out that
Ghantâkarna and she were brother and sister, since both were from S ́iva, and it
would be wrong for Ghantâkarna to lick the face of his sister.
Ghantâkarna at first took Vishnu to be his enemy. He put bells (ghantâ) in
his ears (karnas) to prevent hearing any mention of Vishnu. However, S ́iva
instructed Ghantâkarna that Vishnu was greater than he (S ́iva). So Ghantâkarna
became a devotee of Vishnu and sought to obtain salvation from him. One day
Shrî Krishna was meditating at a hermitage called Badarya-as ́rama and heard the
sounds of Pis ́âcas, hungry souls of the dead, and their hunting dogs. They were
led by Ghantâkarna, who was reciting the name of Vishnu (a practice called
japa). Krishna blessed him and appeared as Vis ́varûpa, the all embracing form of
the supreme lord of the universe. At once Ghantâkarna brought the best offering
a râkshasa knew to give, a dead corpse of a brâhmin. Krishna looked past the gift
into the heart of this demon and touched his body. Immediately the demon lost
his form and entered Vaikuntha, Vishnu’s paradise.
Ghantâkarna’s image with eighteen hands is worshipped in Vaishnava tem
ples as the god who cures diseases that result from one’s own sins. Ghantâkarna
was the râkshasa who became a deva.

GHATOTKACA
Son of Bhîma by his râkshasa wife Hidumbhî
In the Râmâyana the tale is told that soon after the Pandava brothers began their
forest exile, a râkshasa chief sent his sister, Hidumbhî, to capture them for his
dinner. However, Hidumbhî fell in love with Bhîma, the strongest and most phys
ical of the brothers. The râkshasa chief came to collect his dinner himself but
was promptly killed. Hidumbhî begged Kuntî, mother of the Pandavas, to inter
cede for her with Bhîma. So the clan allowed their marriage with the condition,
that it would only be valid in the forest and the mountains during the day. At
night Bhîma would return for his turn as husband of Draupadî, the brothers’ joint
wife. Ghatotkaca was born to Bhîma and Hidumbhî and became a great help both
in the forest and later on the Kurukshetra battlefield. During the great war Gha
totkaca proved to be one of the greatest warriors, killing Kaurava allies, including
kings on their war elephants, and winning great duels against other heroes.
Finally, he was killed by Karna (son of Kuntî and Sûrya), who had to use his mag
142 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



ical weapon (vaijayantî s ́aktî) to kill Ghatotkaca instead of using it on Arjuna.
Thus Ghatotkaca died a hero’s death. He appeared on the banks of the Gangâ with
the rest when the souls of the heroes were called from death by Vyâsa for the Kau
ravas’ mother, Gândhârî. After death, he lived in the heaven of the Yaksha-devas.

GHOSHÂ
A woman sage
Ghoshâ was mentioned in the Rigveda several times. She was born from a fine
lineage of sages. Her grandfather was the mahârishi Drigata and her father was
Kakshîvân. As a child she contracted leprosy, and consequently no one would
marry her. Consequently, she studied and practiced great austerities and became
a great magician (tapasvinî). However, her greatest accomplishment was a hymn
in praise of the As ́vins, the twin physicians of the devas. Greatly flattered, the
As ́vins cured her of leprosy. Then she married.

GHRITÂCÎ
An apsara
Ghritâcî was an apsara, a heavenly nymph. Her beauty was so overwhelming
that many great brâhmins, whether married rishi (sage) or ascetic, fell victim to
her charms. Several, Bharadvâja and Vyâsa, saw her and after years of ascetic
practice (tapasya) had seminal emissions, followed by miraculous births of sons.
Later Bharadvâja saw her again and lost control a second time, only to have a
noble daughter, S ́rutâvatî. Others of her conquests included King Pramati, sage
Ashthâvakra, and sage Vis ́vakarman. She danced at Arjuna’s birthday celebra
tion without any serious disruption. Her myths were a reminder of how easy it
was to lose decades of merit from austerities (tapas) for a moment’s pleasure.

GOTAMA
A sage mentioned in the Rigveda
This sage was probably a historical person of the Vedic period. Gotama, son of
Rahûgana, was not the sage Gautama, husband of Ahalyâ. There were many ref
erences to Gotama in the Rigveda. He wrote hymns contained in the seventy
fourth sûkta of the thirteenth anuvâka of the first mandala of the Rigveda.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 143



There are two versions of a story about a well. Once Gotama was very
thirsty and asked the Maruts for some water. The Maruts took a whole well to
him and poured the water into a pot at his hermitage (as ́rama). Another version
said that it was not the Maruts but the As ́vinidevas who took the well to the
as ́rama of Gotama. Because references to myths in the Rigveda were usually
incomplete and seemed to presuppose the hearers’ knowledge of the story’s con
text and meaning, we are left to puzzle over its point. Having the gods bring a
well of water to a sage would seem to prove the greatness of this sage, but if that
was the point, one would think Gotama would have received more mention in
later mythology.

GUNASHARMAN
A brâhmin magician and sage and king
In the Purânas, Gunasharman’s story is nested within an episode about his
father Âdityasharman. The father used his great spiritual powers (tapas) to cre
ate an apsara (heavenly damsel) for himself, whom he named Sulocanâ. When a
son, Gunasharman, was born to them, Âdityasharman became a deva (god) and
went to Brahmaloka (heaven). One day Indra came to visit Âdityasharman, who
could not be aroused from his contemplation. Indra was insulted and cursed him
to be born a mortal again on earth. Âdityasharman immediately became alert
and tried to placate Indra’s anger. Indra decided that it would be punishment
enough for his son Gunasharman to suffer the curse of his father.
Gunasharman grew up as a mortal and developed in all the sciences and
arts, just as his father had done. He became an intimate of King Mahâsena and
Queen As ́okavatî of Ujjayinî. He even used his spiritual powers to rescue
Mahâsena when he was captured in battle. One day the king asked Gunashar
man to give a dance performance, which he did with such beauty and grace
that the king had Gunasharman teach dance to his wife. Naturally, the queen
fell in love with her wonderful teacher. However, he rejected her love. Queen
As ́okavatî then told the king that Gunasharman had acted improperly toward
her, so Gunasharman had to flee the palace, evading the king’s guards only by
his magical powers. He hid in the hermitage of Agnidatta and married
Agnidatta’s daughter, Sundarî. There Gunasharman practiced austerities
(tapas) to acquire more powers, propitiating Subrahmanya (also called Kârt
tikeya, son of S ́iva and commander-in-chief of S ́iva’s minions) and receiving
martial powers from him. Then he returned to the kingdom of Ujjayinî, used
these powers to conquer it, and became its king. King Mahâsena and Queen
As ́okavatî were exiled.

Was dharma served? Perhaps Gunasharman completed the ritual to change
caste from brâhmin to ks ́atriya, but the myths do not add that detail.

HALÂHALA
A poison
Some accounts stated that halâhala had been churned up from the Milky Ocean
and absorbed by the nâgas (serpents) and became their venom. Other accounts
said that halâhala was the poison vomited up by Vâsuki, king of the nâgas, dur
ing the time of the churning of the Milky Ocean. In order to prevent it from
falling to earth and destroying everything, S ́iva drank it. Pârvatî had to act
quickly and pressed his neck to prevent the poison from going inside S ́iva’s body.
The poison was absorbed in S ́iva’s neck, which turned blue. Henceforth, he was
known as Nilakanta, which means the blue-necked one.

HAMSA, HANSA
(1) An incarnation of Vishnu in Krita Yuga (the second age)
According to the Bhâgavata Purâna Hamsa was a prajâpati, a progenitor or cre
ator. Hamsa taught yoga to sages like Sanaka and taught the way to liberation
for the Sâdhyadevas, a class of divine witnesses of battles and celebrations in
late mythology. Hamsa, like Vishnu, was also called the sacrifice (yâjña). The
teachings of Hamsa were known as the Hamsa Gîtâ, a sacred book no longer
extant. Hamsa did not become important enough to be included in lists of incar
nations of Vishnu and became one of the many incarnations to be forgotten or
reduced to a category of partial incarnations.

(2) A gandharva (celestial musician)
Hamsa was given a partial incarnation as Dhritarâshthra, whose role in the
Mahâbhârata deserved an important prior existence. As a gandharva, he was the
son of Kas ́yapa-Prajâpati by his wife Arishtâ.

HANUMAN
A monkey and a god
Hanuman expanded the notion of the divine, perhaps more than any other being
in Hindu mythology. He appeared as an agent governed by dharma like any
human, yet while in an animal form he was divine. The myths of his birth from
the elements of the gods, usually of S ́iva and Vâyu (the wind god), proved his
divinity. There were four different myths of his divine birth, ranging from the
union of S ́iva and Vishnu to one about his mother, Anjanâ, eating a divine pud
ding that made her pregnant.
Hanuman’s name has traditionally been associated with the legend of S ́rî
Râma. Nevertheless, he has gained an independent status as a god in recent folk
myths that have spread from northern to southern India. His status is evidenced
by the popularity of the forty rhymes of Tulsidas (the great medieval poet),
Hanuman Câlisa, glorifying Hanuman as a deity, by his presence in popular
films and poster art, and by the reverence shown to ordinary monkeys in mod
ern India.
Myths about Hanuman told of his mighty power and his ability to perform
superhuman tasks. Hanuman lifted up the whole mountain of Kailâsa and
brought it to Râma in order for him to find a special medicinal herb. Hanuman
built the bridge across the ocean (setubandhana) to reach Lanka, slew the
demoness of Mount Mainâka, and led his army of monkeys in the battle against
Râvana.
Hanuman was portrayed in the myths as, and is still believed to be, a great
yogi as well as an unusually talented musician. He was described as possessing
the ashtha siddhis (the eight superhuman powers), such as being able to be light
as a feather or impossible to move, to become invisible, to fly, and to reduce or
enlarge his form. He was one of the rare beings who were truly immortal; he
would never see death. Apart from all this, Hanuman was an erudite grammar
ian and poet. But what distinguished him from other Hindu gods was the way he
acquired divine status—simply by his deep-rooted devotion to S ́rî Râma, who
was an incarnation of Vishnu. He was, and is, the best example to Hindus of an
ideal devotee and the most adorable and worshipped among the popular devotees
in the Hindu pantheon. (Other examples are Dhruva, Prahalâda, and Arjuna.)
An early reference mentioned Hanuman as an incarnation of the eleventh
Rudra (a deva). It is quite possible that Hanuman might have been a deity of a
local tribe, later adopted as a Hindu divinity.
The origin of this god can be traced back to the myth of the churning of the
Milky Ocean as told in the S ́iva Purâna, which stated that he was the son of S ́iva
and the feminine form of Vishnu as Môhinî. The semen of S ́iva was deposited in
the womb of Anjanâ by the seven rishis (saptarishis). (A recent variation of the
146 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Hanuman, the paradigm of loyal friend in his service to Râma, takes his divine form
in order to bring a mountain with healing herbs. (TRIP)



Hanuman myth associates the union of S ́iva and Môhinî with the origin of
Swami Ayyappa, a very popular deity in South India, merging past and present,
theriomorphic deity and sage.)
Other variations of the story of the origin of Hanuman stated that he was
the son of Vâyu, the wind god, or the son of Kesari, the monkey chieftain. One
account said that both S ́iva and Vâyu assumed the form of Kesari and had inter
course with Anjanâ. As the son of Vâyu Hanuman would be connected with the
myths about Bhîma, who in the Mahâbhârata is also a son of Vâyu.
Hanuman was one of the few gods who has been given episodes in every
period of Hindu mythology. His life stretched between two incarnations of
Vishnu in this kalpa and involved associations with them both: with S ́rî Râma
in treta yuga and with S ́rî Krishna in dvâpara yuga, the age that followed. His
devotees put these different embedded myths together to prove that Hanuman
had a presence in all ages and thus had perfect immortality, a boon Hanuman
was given by S ́rî Râma. He was known as one of the ciranjivis, the seven beings
who would never experience death.
Iconographically, Hanuman is easily recognizable as a monkey who is either
the loyal servant of Râma or the great warrior of the Râmâyana. As a servant his
two hands are held together in a mood of devotion (añjali-hasta). As a warrior
he holds a thunderbolt (vajra) in one hand, and his feet seem to tear up the
ground beneath him.

HARA
An epithet of S ́iva
Hara (the remover) was an epithet first associated with Rudra and the Maruts,
both gods of storm. It had the connotation of death, the destruction that removes
all things. By the Epic period Hara referred to S ́iva, the destroyer.
There was a manifestation of the godhead as Harihara, the right half as Hara,
or S ́iva, and the left half as Hari or Vishnu. Found in a number of temples, Hari
hara has the matted hair of S ́iva and all of S ́iva’s ornaments and weapons on the
right, and the crown of Vishnu and all of his ornament and weapons on the left.

148 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



HARI
(1) An epithet of Vishnu
Coming from the same root as the epithet Hara for S ́iva (hri, to remove), Hari
also means “the remover.” There are many minor figures with this name, as
well as a number of groups (some of the demon king Râvana’s attendants, a
group of devas, and others). Eventually, however, it became an epithet synony
mous with Vishnu, the remover of the sorrows of the world. Hari has been heard
around the world in its vocative form, Hare, chanted by Hare Krishnas as the
opening word of the great Hare Krishna mantra of salvation.
See also Hara; S ́iva; Vishnu
(2) A son of Dharma-deva, the god Dharma
Hari (the remover) was a son of the god Dharma (righteousness). The other three
sons were Krishna (the dark one), Nara (man), and Nârâyana (moving on the
waters). All these figures had characteristics and myths associated with love and
devotion (bhakti) directed to a personal god.
See also Dharma; Krishna; Nara; Nârâyana
HARIDHÂMA
A sage
Haridhâma was a great sage devoted to Krishna who wanted nothing more than
to be reborn near his lord. Consequently, he was reborn as Rangavenî, a female
cowherd (gopikâ or gopî) in Gokula, the cow-tending colony. Thus, Rangavenî
was near Krishna, which was the reward for his chanting the Krishna mantra so
many times. The myth taught a devotion (bhakti) so great that one would
become like a woman, longing for Krishna’s love.

HARIMITRA
A righteous brâhmin
In the Padma Purâna Harimitra had an as ́rama (hermitage) on the banks of the
river Yamunâ. A sinner named Vikundala became associated with Harimitra and
followed his practice of a ritual bath in the Yamunâ. It just happened that he
took a bath twice in the Yamunâ during the Hindu month of Magha. Vikundala
was liberated from all his sins with the first bath, and with the second he was
eligible to go to heaven. Vikundala’s good karma came from right association
with a righteous brâhmin and from following rituals prescribed in the scriptures.

HARISCANDRA
A king of Ayodhyâ
King Hariscandra of Ayodhyâ was very famous for his commitment to truth and
for keeping his promises. Victim of a great magician’s magical powers, Hariscan
dra represents all righteous persons who have suffered wrongly. Hariscandra lost
his kingdom, his wife, and his only son, for the sake of keeping his word. For fur
ther details about the magician’s wrath, see the entry on Vis ́vâmitra. There was
also another story about his father, Tris ́anku (three sins), who could not get into
heaven but had a heaven made for himself between heaven and earth.
Finally, Hariscandra was blessed by the Trimûrtis (the divine triad), was
granted prosperity, and got back everything that he had lost.

HARITÂS ́VA
A king of the Sûrya-vamsa (solar dynasty)
In the Epics kings could be as great as gods. One such king was Haritâs ́va, king
of Ayodhyâ. He was greatly accomplished in the arts. He surpassed the sage
Nârada and the goddess Sarasvatî in music. He pleased Brahmâ with his music
and put Vishnu to sleep. Once S ́iva was competing with Haritâs ́va and played a
particular raga, a musical piece, called sankarâbharana, dedicated to Lord S ́iva.
Haritâs ́va pointed out that instead of the santa rasa, the emotion of peace, it
should be played in raudra rasa, the emotion of anger. S ́iva became furious and
opened his third eye at Haritâs ́va. Gods like Kâma had been burned to ashes by
S ́iva’s third eye. Haritâs ́va, however, was not intimidated because he knew that
he was right. S ́iva was pleased with his excellence and courage and blessed Hari
tâs ́va with wealth and prosperity.
A greater test came later. The gods were being abused by a great demon,
Andhaka-asura. He conquered heaven (svarga) against the combined efforts of
the Trimûrti (Brahmâ, Vishnu, and S ́iva). Brihaspati, priest of the gods, advised
them to get help from King Haritâs ́va. Agastya, a great rishi of superhuman pow
ers, told Haritâs ́va that the demon was protected with images of S ́iva and Pârvatî
in his belly. Consequently, Haritâs ́va fired his arrows at Andhaka-asura’s belly,
removing his protection, and killed him. That was how a king restored Deva
loka (svarga) to Indra (king of the devas) and the gods.

HARIVAMSA
An appendix to the Mahâbhârata
This appendix to the Mahâbhârata is said to be authored by Vyâsa, as indicated
in the Adi Parva (2.83–84) of the Mahâbhârata. The Harivamsa consists of glo
rifications of Vishnu and has about ten thousand verses. It is a rich source for the
myths about the childhood of Krishna, as well as for myths about the Vâmana
(dwarf) and Narasimha (man-lion) incarnations of Vishnu.

Havyaghna had a miraculous birth, being created from the smoke of a sacrificial
ritual (yâjña) of the sage Bharadvâja. Havyaghna (“leavings of the sacrifice”)
began eating the leftovers (havis) of that yâjña. Bharadvâja asked the demon why
he would do this. Havyaghna explained that he was the Krishna that Brahmâ had
cursed and could be freed from that curse if Bharadvâja would sprinkle him with
Gangâ water, ghee, and soma. When Bharadvâja did as asked, Havyaghna was
redeemed from Brahmâ’s curse.

HAYAGRÎVA
(1) A deva (god)
In the Pañcavimsa Brâhmana the story is told that four devas began a sacrifice
(yâjña) with the agreement that the offering (havirbhâga) would be shared
equally. They were Agni, Indra, Vâyu, and Yâjña. But Yâjña stole the offering and
drove the others away with a divine bow given by Devî. So the devas created ter
mites (cital), and they ate through the bowstring. It straightened with such force
that it severed Yâjña’s head from his body. The devas took pity on his plight and
put a horse’s head on Yâjña’s body.
See also Agni; Devî; Indra; Vâyu; Yâjña
(2) A demon (asura) and an incarnation of Vishnu
This Purânic myth told of two Hayagrîvas—one a demon and the other Vishnu,
or rather his incarnation. The first phase of the story set the scene for the lord’s
rescue of the world from the demon’s evil.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 151



Hayagrîva the asura was the son of Kas ́yapa-prajâpati by his wife Danu. He
practiced austerities (tapas) for a thousand years and got the attention of Devî.
She appeared and offered him a boon. He asked to become both invincible and
immortal. She knew that even Brahmâ would only give these qualities as provi
sional boons, so Hayagrîva had to settle for the boon of only being killed by
another Hayagrîva (one with the neck of a horse). Since there were no others in
the entire universe, he went on a rampage. He even fought Lord Vishnu until
even Vishnu needed a rest. However, Vishnu slept as a warrior should, sitting up
with one end of his bow in the ground and the other end under his chin.
Unfortunately, there had been a curse that would make this sleep result in
Vishnu losing his head. Long ago, Vishnu had laughed in Lakshmî’s presence,
and she cursed him, thinking that he no longer thought her beautiful. She said
that his head would be severed from his body. That was about to happen. Haya
grîva tormented the gods until they had to awaken Vishnu. So Brahmâ created
termites (cital) and bribed them with a promise that they could have the left
overs (havis) of the sacrifices (yâjñas) if they gnawed through the bowstring so
that its release would awaken Vishnu. They did, but the bow cut off his head.
Some accounts stated that he found a new head for himself, others that the gods
did—but the result was the same. The head was from a horse, and Vishnu
became a Hayagrîva (one with the neck of a horse). As in other incarnations,
Vishnu was able to end the evil that had come into the world and restore its har
mony. There were many versions of this story, but they all gave Vishnu the neck
of a horse and victory over Hayagrîva, the asura.

(3) An asura
During the time of the Vaivashvata Manu (also known as the Satyavrata Manu),
while Brahmâ was reciting the Vedas, Hayagrîva stole them. Matsya, an incarna
tion of Vishnu, recovered the Vedas, which had fallen into the ocean from the
mouth of Brahmâ when he fell asleep at the beginning of one of his nights—the end
of a Yuga and the beginning of a Pralaya (period of dissolution and cosmic flood).

HEMAKÂNTA
A prince
While Brâhmanical ideology taught that killing a brâhmin (brahmahatyâ) was
the worst of sins and required loss of caste, Purânic mythology told of those who
had killed a brâhmin and escaped becoming outcaste (candâla). This alternative
view shifted the focus to devotion (bhakti) and its outward signs in gifts of com
152 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



passion (dâna) and grace (prasâda) from the Supreme. So the story in the Skanda
Purâna about Hemakânta, a prince, had real importance. Hemakânta, the son of
the King Kusaketu, committed brahmahatyâ, the sin of killing a brâhmin, on a
victim named S ́atârcas. He was absolved of that sin when he gave a brâhmin
named Trita some water to drink.

HEMAMÂLI
A celestial gardener
In this late myth in the Padma Purâna, Kubera, god of wealth, is portrayed as a
devotionalist (bhakta). He had a wonderful garden with beautiful flowers that he
used in temple worship each day. One day his gardener, Hemamâli, came back from
a visit to the lake of the gods, Mânasasaras, filled with love for his beautiful wife,
Visâlâkshî. He forgot all about his duty to get flowers to Kubera for his worship.
Kubera waited all day at the temple, but Hemamâli was sporting with his wife.
Kubera became very angry and summoned Hemamâli to his palace. Hemamâli
apologized and told the truth. Kubera placed a curse on Hemamâli: that he would
become a leper. Then Kubera expelled Hemamâli from Alakapuri, Kubera’s heaven.
Hemamâli met the sage Mârkandeya, to whom he told his sad story. The
sage advised him to observe a specific kind of fasting with mantras, called as ́âda
Krishna ekadâshi (worship of Krishna to remove a punishment). Hemamâli
observed the ekadâshi and was cured of leprosy. From his tapas (austerities) he
again gained Devaloka (heaven).

HIRANYAGARBHA
The golden egg or womb
The word hiranyagarbha is found in the Vedic literature referring to the
primeval origin of the world within a golden womb or shell. It remained an
image that was not greatly developed. For further details, refer to chapter 1 on
creation myths, “Cosmogony, Theogony, and Anthropogony.”
HIRANYAHASTA
Son of a princess
Hiranyahasta’s story came from a time when gods had sons with princesses.
Hiranyahasta’s mother was Princess Vadhrimatî, who was married to a eunuch.
Despondent that she could not have a child, Vadhrimatî prayed to the As ́vins,
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 153



the divine twins. The physicians of the devas happily fulfilled her desire.
Hiranyahasta grew up a sage, possibly even a brâhmin, since he married the
daughter of the sage Matarisvan. Another version said he married a princess, the
daughter of King Madirâshva.

HIRANYAKAS ́IPU
An asura (demon)
Hiranyakas ́ipu was a worthy opponent of Lord Vishnu, born repeatedly, which
necessitated multiple incarnations of Vishnu to conquer this powerful asura and
restore dharma (righteousness) to earth. A demon of this magnitude would have
quite a lineage and an appropriate source of his tremendous powers. There was
a time before the life when he had this name when he was the very doorkeeper
(dvârapâlâkas) of Lord Vishnu at Vaikuntha. His name in that previous birth
was Jâya. His elder twin brother was Vijâya, also a doorkeeper. One day a group
of hermits led by Sanaka came to Vaikuntha to see Vishnu. They were stopped
by Jâya and Vijâya. But the sages took offense and cursed the doorkeepers to be
reborn three times as demons (asuras). The frightened doorkeepers begged the
angry brâhmins for forgiveness, but they only slightly lessened the punishment:
after three births, they would be redeemed by the weapon of Lord Vishnu.
Accordingly, the twins were reborn on earth as twin demons, Hiranyakas ́ipu
and Hiranyâksha, who came from the womb first. Their first earthly parents were
Kas ́yapa-Prajâpati and his wife Ditî. After Hiranyâksha was killed by Lord Vishnu
in his Vâmana (boar) avatâra (incarnation), Hiranyakas ́ipu did austerities (tapas)
in order to increase his strength and get revenge. He was so good at ascetic disci
plines that he earned boons from Brahmâ and immediately conquered the three
worlds. He was crowned Triloka Cakravarti (emperor of the three lokas [worlds]).
He prevented everyone from saying Vishnu’s name or even thinking about him.
He instituted his own worship with the mantra Hiranyâya namah (salutation to
Hiranya). However, his son, Prahlâda became a devotee to Vishnu and chanted
Nârâyanâya namah (salutation to Nârâyana, in other words, Lord Vishnu).
Hiranyakas ́ipu was killed by the Narasimha incarnation of Vishnu (as man-lion).

keepers, then their first rebirth as Hiranyâksha and Hiranyakas ́ipu, a second
rebirth as Râvana and Kumbhakarna, and finally their third rebirth as S ́is ́upâla
and Dantavaktra.
Hiranyâksha was the eldest twin and began his rampage first. He stalked the
three worlds with his war club and sent the devas (gods) running away in terror.
In the meantime, the earth became flooded and the Manu of that age, Svayamb
huva, asked Brahmâ to raise the earth out of the waters. Some versions said that
it was Hiranyâksha who had abducted Bhîmî (the earth) and taken her beneath
the waters. So Brahmâ meditated on Lord Vishnu and a tiny boar (vâmana) came
from Brahmâ’s nose. The boar rapidly grew and then plunged into the waters and
rescued Bhîmî. Hiranyâksha immediately knew that this enormous boar was
Vishnu, so they fought a duel to the finish. Hiranyâksha was killed, and the
proper order was brought back to the earth.

IDÂ
A goddess
In the Rigveda, idâ was a word for food or refreshment, especially milk. In the
hymns idâ worked metaphorically as the refreshment given to the devas (gods) as
praise. Thus, it connected with vâc (sound) and could be personified as Idâ, the god
dess who instructed the first Manu concerning the rules for an efficacious sacrifice.
In the Taittirîya Brâhmana the role of the priest can be seen as expanding;
Idâ is described as created by the first Manu out of his sacrifice. She was sent by
him to see how the devas performed the consecration of fire (agnyâdhâna), and
she returned with the shocking information that their method was less effective
than hers. So she constructed the three firepits (trividhâgnis) properly. The
devas invited her publicly to instruct them. The asuras (demons) seemed to have
some reservations about being taught by a priestess, so they only invited her to
come to them in secret. Idâ accepted the invitation of the devas, and her instruc
tions were witnessed by all creatures. The story concluded that this was why all
creatures came to worship the devas instead of the asuras.
The Idâ myth has elements that are quite ancient. There was a shamaness
priestess-goddess who taught gods and priests. There was, simultaneously,
metaphor and personification. The clear process of ritualization can be seen as
Idâ’s birth from fire is changed to her birth as the daughter of the first Manu. And
there is the boast in this myth that the sacrificial ritual (yâjña) of the brâhmins
was more effective in controlling the powers (mâyâ) of the universe than the
power of the gods.

ILÂ
Daughter of Vaivasvata-Manu and S ́raddhâ
The myth of Ilâ is about the plasticity of gender, with Ilâ moving back and forth
between male and female in the same lifetime. Ilâ’s father, Vaivasvata-Manu,
was the son of Kas ́yapa-prajâpati and Aditi, the first parents in this myth. Her
sons were all celestials and divine (âdityas) yet she was a mortal—this is one of
the inconsistencies of Purânic myths.
Ilâ’s parents, Vaivasvata Manu and S ́raddhâ (trust), did not have children for
a long time, so they asked Sage Agastya to perform a yâjña (sacrifice) to Mitra
and Varuna for a son. However, a mistake was made in the ritual, and they
received a daughter instead. They named her Ilâ (some versions say Idâ). They
propitiated Mitra and Varuna, and Ilâ’s sex was changed. Consequently, they
named their son Sudyumna. But S ́iva became displeased and changed Sudyumna
back into Ilâ. At this point Ilâ married Budha (the planet Mercury) and gave birth
to a son named Purûravas. Then by pleasing Vishnu, Ilâ was again changed into
Sudyumna, married, and became the father of three sons.
There is another version that reverses all this. Vaivasvata-Manu and S ́rad
dhâ did the sacrifice and received a son whom they named Ila. However, young
Ila angered Pârvatî by trespassing in her sacred grove, so she turned him into a
girl—Ilâ. After many prayers of supplication S ́iva and Pârvatî changed the pun
ishment to one month as a female followed by a month as a male for the remain
der of that lifetime.

INDRA
A deva (god)
Indra’s mythology underwent more change than that of perhaps any other god in
the Hindu pantheon. Indra appeared in the oldest hymns of the Rigveda as the
god par excellence of the warriors (ks ́atriyas). This stratum of hymns was so
ancient that Indra and Varuna were referred to as asuras, the older word for the
“shining” gods. He was older than the âdityas but was later added as the fourth
âditya. He battled an ancient monster called Vritra, who later became a serpent
whose body encircled the celestial waters and, once defeated, released the rains.
He even fought with Dadhyañc, an Atharvan priest, and the As ́vins to preserve
the secret of soma. He used the bones of Dadhyañc’s horse head to slay demons
that were overrunning the earth. He pursued the magical cow of Tvashthri to the
moon and freed the cows penned up in a cave. The fragments that allude to these
exploits in the Vedic hymns do not allow for a reconstruction of the full story.
Clearly, though, Indra rose to replace Vâyu (wind) in the first triad and was even
156 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



prayed to as the most important of the gods in a number of the hymns. He
brought the soma plant from heaven, taking it from the asuras (demons). He
killed enemies, both asuras and non-Aryans. He destroyed stone cities and took
slaves. There was no hint in these hymns that he was anything less than the
greatest ideal warrior-god.
In the Brâhmanas (commentaries) Indra’s status began to slip. As the power
and magic of the Brâhmanical ritual increased, fear of Indra did as well. He
became the focus of awareness that the gods were being challenged by the ide
ology of ritualism and a “science” of austerities that produced results because of
an esoteric knowledge of causality that controlled even the gods. Indra began to
lose battles with demons and to need help from brâhmins and the renewing
power of their rituals and austerities.
In the Epics and Purânas Indra was reduced to the mere leader of demigods
who were still called devas but had little power or energy. Indra was pictured as
always being afraid of losing his position as Indra, the office of king of the devas
that he did in fact keep losing. He began to employ the celestial damsels
(apsaras) to distract or seduce sages whose austerities (tapas) were able to con
trol gods and demons. Indra needed help constantly from supreme deities like
S ́iva, Vishnu, or Devî. Worst of all, Indra’s character had changed. He was no
longer a proud and powerful warrior, but a seducer of sage’s wives, using his
shape-shifting abilities to deceive them. Drunk and disorderly, he had become a
mere clown with the honorary title of king of the gods.
His degradation benefited Brâhmanical ritualism, devotionalism (especially
in the form of worship of supreme deities), the “spiritual-austerity sciences”
(tapasya, yoga, and the like), and the metaphysical philosophies (dars ́anas like
Advaita Vedânta). There were further degradations in his decline: his castration
in an episode with Ahalyâ and Gautama, being cursed with a thousand yonis later
made into eyes, and the reduction of the most voluptuous of all the god’s wives,
his wife Indrânî, to a demon wife, Sacî. He was turned into a killer of a priest, cas
trated, beheaded, and cursed to have no temple to worship him. In no other
mythology has an orthodox priesthood so treated one of their most sacred deities.

INDRADYUMNA
Son of King Sumati
In the Bhâgavata Purâna Indradyumna was a saintly king who was engaged in
deep meditation. One day he was visited by the sage Agastya. Indradyumna did
not notice the arrival of Agastya, who took the king’s neglect for an insult.
Agastya was enraged and cursed Indradyumna to become a mighty tusker, the
elephant Gajendra. The grief-stricken Indradyumna asked Agastya to liberate
him from the curse. Agastya said that he would be redeemed from the curse by
Vishnu’s touch.
Indradyumna, now as Gajendra, lived as an elephant for many years. One
day he went to drink water from a lake at Mount Trikuta. In that lake lived a
former gandharva named Hûhû, who also had been cursed. He had disturbed the
sage Devala’s devotions when the sage saw Hûhû frolicking with celestial maid
ens (apsaras) in the lake near his hermitage. Devala’s curse turned Hûhû into a
crocodile.
When Indradyumna as Gajendra the elephant stepped into the lake to drink,
Hûhû the crocodile caught hold of his hind leg and tried to drag him under. They
fought for a thousand years. Gajendra in great pain prayed to Vishnu, offering
lotus flowers with his trunk. The prayer made by Gajendra on this occasion
became a famous hymn in praise of Vishnu called the Gajendra Stuti. Vishnu
came and killed Hûhû and redeemed Indradyumna from the curse. Indradyumna
immediately attained Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu.

INDRÂNI
Wife of Indra
There are a number of references in the Rigveda to Indrânî but her story was not
told. She was chosen by Indra as his wife from among many other goddesses
because she was said to be the most voluptuous. But in the Purânas Indrânî
became Sacî, daughter of Puloma, a demon. She was also called by the
patronymic Paulomî. As Indra was reduced, so too was his wife—from a goddess
richly endowed to a demoness.

ÎS ́VARA
The general term for the most powerful god
There are three terms (îs ́a, îs ́âna, îs ́vara) that all come from the root, îs ́ (to have
power). All can be translated as “lord,” or “the one who possesses power.” These
158 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



terms were applied to many of the devas in the Vedic period—Indra, Mitra,
Varuna, Soma, and Sâvitrî. In late Vedic texts Rudra, linked to S ́iva, was called
îs ́âna, master, or “the ruling one.” Purusha was also called the îs ́vara of immor
tality and the immortal and imperishable îs ́a (in the Svetasvatâra Upanishad).
In later periods these terms came to be used exclusively for a god seen as the
Supreme Being (either Vishnu or S ́iva). That is why the term deva is sometimes
translated demigod when it is used for the gods who are not supreme, to distin
guish them from the Supreme. The term îs ́varî meant “princess,” but could also
be used to indicate the Supreme as the Great Mother.

JADA
A brâhmin
This is a Purânic myth about dharma—a father who failed to keep his dharma
and sons who kept theirs. Jada was a brâhmin who became an unscrupulous
businessman. But he was robbed and killed and reborn a pis ́âca, a hunger ghost.
His sons were quite moral and did their duty toward their father. They decided
to go to Kâs ́i (Benares) to perform proper rituals for the spirit of their father. As
they recited the third chapter of Bhagavad Gîtâ, their father’s angry spirit was
redeemed from its state, and Jada was able to be reborn as a human.

JAHNU
A sage
Jahnu gave his kingdom to his son and retired to a quiet spot to do austerities
(tapas). However, cosmic events disturbed his meditations. King Bhagîratha had
been successful in his austerities to get S ́iva’s help in bringing the sacred river
Gangâ to earth. And when it came, it flooded Jahnu’s hermitage (as ́rama). Jahnu
used some of his powers (siddhis) and drank up the Gangâ. Bhagîratha had to
come to Jahnu and persuade him to allow the Gangâ to flow again. So Jahnu
pushed Gangâ-devî out of his ear.

JÂJALI
A hermit mentioned in the Mahâbhârata
This myth presents two competing spiritual paths: one of austerities (tapas) and
another of spirituality located in a householder’s life.
Jâjali had developed into a great ascetic. One day as he was doing a standing
meditation, a pair of birds built their nest in his matted hair. So began a period
when the mother bird laid her eggs, these hatched, and the young birds were
raised. Still Jâjali remained motionless. Finally they flew away and did not come
back. Only then did Jâjali go to the sea and bathe. He proclaimed to the sea that
surely there was no more virtuous man than himself. But a voice—some texts
say from heaven, others say that of a sea demon—spoke back to him: that there
was a merchant (vais ́ya) in Kâshî (Benares) named Tulâdhâra who was more vir
tuous than he. So Jâjali went to the city, found the vais ́ya Tulâdhâra, and dis
covered that what was said was true. He became Tulâdhâra’s disciple and
thereby gained heaven.

JAMADAGNI
A brâhmin sage, father of divine incarnation Parasu-Râma
Jamadagni was born by a miraculous birth in which his caste was determined
not be birth but by a magical portion of rice pudding. His father, the sage Ricîka,
a wonderous and powerful magician (siddha) gave his two wives different por
tions to determine the qualities of his future sons. Satyavâtî switched her por
tion with the second wife and her son, Jamadagni was born with the qualities of
a warrior (ks ́triya) but the caste of his brâhmin father.
Jamadagni studied hard and mastered all the Vedas. Then he went to King
Prasenajit (also known as Renu) and demanded to be given his daughter in mar
riage. The king gave him the princess Renukâ without complaint. Thus, she
went to Jamadagni’s hermitage to a life of austerities and bore Jamadagni five
sons, the youngest being Parasu-Râma. (See more about her temptation and pun
ishment in the entry on Renukâ.)
One day Jamadagni became furious with his wife when she was late with his
meal because she had been watching love play at the bathing ghat. So he ordered
his sons to kill her. Only the youngest, Parasu-Râma, a lad of fourteen, obeyed
and cut off his mother’s head with an ax (some versions said with a cutting
arrow). The other four sons were cursed to become imbeciles by the old brâh
min-warrior Jamadagni. He was so pleased with Parasu-Râma that he granted
him a boon. Parasu-Râma asked that his mother be restored to life completely
purified of all sins and that his brothers become normal again.
160 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Later King Kârtavîryârjuna and his hunting party came to Jamadagni’s her
mitage and asked for hospitality. Jamadagni called his divine cow Sushîlâ, and
she immediately provided a feast for the king and his huge retinue. Unfortu
nately, however, the king never forgot about this cow. There are a number of ver
sions of what happened next. In one, the king tries to give a thousand cows for
Sushîlâ but finally, tired of being rebuffed, he (or his minister) stole the divine
cow and her calf, leaving Jamadagni for dead.
In another account, Renukâ gave King Kârtavîryârjuna food and drink at the
hermitage. Kârtavîryârjuna then destroyed their grove of trees and stole the divine
cow. But in each version, Paras ́u-Râma went after the cow, met the king and his
army in battle, and killed them all. In a longer version his wounded father,
Jamadagni, sent Paras ́u-râma to Mahendragiri to do penance for killing so many
people. And while Paras ́u-Râma was away, King Kârtavîryârjuna’s youngest son
came with an army and murdered the old brâhmin Jamadagni. His sons and disci
ples built a funeral pyre and began the proper rituals. At this point Renukâ jumped
into the fire of her husband, committing sati (suttee) by dying in the flames.

JÂMBAVÂN, JÂMBAVÂT
A great monkey or bear king
There is a lot of confusion as to whether Jâmbhavân was a monkey (kapi) or a
bear (riksha). Vâlmîki’s Râmâyana presented some stories of Jâmbhavân as a
bear and other stories of him as a monkey.
In one version Brahmâ sent the celestial damsels (apsaras) to be reborn
around Râma and help him defeat the demon king Râvana and one was born as
Jâmbhavân. Other versions stated that Jâmbhavân was reborn at each of
Vishnu’s incarnations, not just during his incarnation as Râma. It was in the
Krishna incarnation that, as a bear or a monkey, Jâmbhavân came into posses
sion of the magical gem, Syamantaka. The jewel protected the virtuous and
harmed those who were evil. Sûrya, the sun god, had given the jewel to King
Satrâjit, whose evil brother Prasena wore it hunting and was killed by a lion,
which was in turn killed by the bear (or monkey) Jâmbhavân. Krishna went into
the forest (or a cave in the bear version) and after a twenty-one-day battle was
given the jewel by Jâmbhavân. Jâmbhavân became an ally of Râma and led his
army (of bears or monkeys) against Râvana. He also became the father-in-law of
Krishna, giving his daughter Jâmbavatî to Krishna as one of his wives. One ver
sion said that the jewel was given to Krishna as dowry. In any case, Krishna
returned the divine jewel to King Satrâjit.

JAMBHA
An asura (demon)
Jambha was the leader of the asuras who snatched away the pot of amrita (nec
tar of immortality) from the sage Dhanvantari when he emerged carrying it dur
ing the churning of the Milky Ocean. Jambha, along with his demon cohorts,
was tricked by the beautiful woman Môhinî, the form taken by Vishnu to
recover the nectar of immortality.

JAMBU
A divine rose apple tree mentioned in the Bhâgavata Purâna
This tree bore fruit throughout the year, fruit the size of elephants. The branches
of the Jambu tree reached to heaven. The juice of the fruit flowed as a river.
According to the Bhâgavata Purâna the Jambu tree was watered by devas (gods)
called Siddhacaranas. Near the tree lived the goddess of the tree, who was called
Jambvâdinî or Arunâ. She blessed everybody, even people who merely thought
about her, and cured them of all diseases. The juice of the fruit mixed with soil
and water turned into gold that was much more refined than ordinary gold.
JAMBUKA, JAMBUMALIKA
A sage who was a S ́ûdra in the Uttâra Râmâyana
Jambuka’s ascetic practices threatened the very foundations of Râma’s perfect
rule as king (râmarâjya). Jambuka was a S ́ûdra who had adopted spiritual exer
cises (tapas) that he was not entitled to practice.
Râma had returned from twelve years of exile, and his rule in Ayodhyâ
seemed to fulfill dharma (righteousness) in every possible way. Then one day a
brâhmin and his wife brought their dead child to the king’s court. It did not seem
possible that there could be a child-death during a râmarâjya. The know-it-all
sage Nârada pointed to a breach of varna-as ́rama-dharma (social duties): there
was a S ́ûdra sage in the land practicing tapas. Nârada stated that such a thing
was adharmic and that it had caused the child-death. King Râma left his brother
to take care of funeral rites for the child and a trusted minister to act in his place
against possible invasions. Râma personally searched for this sage until he
finally found Jambuka. When questioned, Jambuka told the king that he was
hanging upside down from the limb of a tree until he bodily went to heaven.
Râma solved this threat to social order by immediately cutting off Jambuka’s
head with his sword. Then everything was solved. Jambuka achieved liberation
(moksha) that very moment and went to heaven. The brâhmin child returned to
162 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



life before he was cremated. And the dharmic order in Râma’s kingdom was
restored.

JANAKA
A king (also known as Sîradhvaja) in the Epics and Purânas
Janaka’s father, Nimi, king of Mithilâ, was childless and asked the venerable
brâhmin Vasishtha to preside over a ritual (yâjña) for a son. Vasishtha was pre
occupied with another ritual and asked the king to wait. King Nimi left without
making any commitment and then found another priest named Gautama to per
form the yâjña. When Vasishtha finished his other business, he went to King
Nimi, who told the priest that the ritual had already been performed. Vasishtha
became so angry that he pronounced a death curse on the king, dooming him to
be without a body (videha). Nimi died instantly. He had no heir, so the rishis
(seers) immediately churned (mathana) a son from his corpse. The son was
named Sîradhvaja, but because of the churning he acquired the name of Mithi
(“churned”) Janaka, and his dynasty would be named Videha.
Now Janaka, king of Mithilâ, was also childless. One day he found a child
born from the furrows of a plowed field. A voice from heaven told him that this
child was Sîtâ and that she was his daughter.
Janaka became a great scholar. He was tested on one occasion by Sulabhâ, a
great shamaness who changed into a beautiful woman and then entered into his
soul while they discussed philosophical subjects. She left ashamed of herself and
convinced that Janaka was both wise and pure. Janaka once clarified the doubts
of Vyâsa’s son S ́uka when even the great sage Vyâsa had not been able to help.
One account said the Janaka was an incarnation of all good qualities. He became
Râma’s father-in-law when Râma married Sîtâ.
The Padma Purâna has two long chapters about Janaka leaving his body
when he was ready to die through his own yogic powers. He was met by a divine
chariot (vimâna) but had a brief stop in hell. After learning from Kâla (time, god
of death) of the torments of hell’s inmates, Janaka chanted “Râm, Râm” (jâpâ)
for them and gained their release. Then he asked Kâla why he had stopped briefly
in hell. Kâla told him that he was the most righteous man of his age, with the
most merit (punya) but that he had once prevented a cow from eating grass. That
sin was now atoned for, and Janaka resumed his journey to heaven.

JANAMEJAYA
A king, father of Parîkshit
According to the Devî Bhâgavata Janamejaya was but an infant when his father
King Parîkshit died from the poisonous bite of Takshâka, king of the serpents.
At an appropriate age Janamejaya was crowned king of Hastinâpura. When he
learned exactly how his father had died, Janamejaya sought a way to rid the
world of snakes. Many great priests came to his kingdom to help perform a rit
ual called Sarpasatra. Soon their mantras and oblations, given to the sacred fire
pit, called snakes of all kinds into the fire where they were burned to death.
However, Takshâka escaped by going to Brahmâ and taking refuge with him.
The high priest, Uttanka, searched for the king of snakes psychically and saw
Takshâka beside Brahmâ. The priest was furious and decided to bring Brahmâ
and his throne along with Takshâka into the fire. The magic worked so well that
that they were pulled down from heaven and were within moments of being con
sumed in the flames. Exactly at that instance the brâhmin Âstîka arrived and
was paid full respect by King Janamejaya. That included offering to fulfill any
wish that Âstîka might have. Âstîka asked for an immediate end to the Sarpa
satra. Thus, Takshâka and those snakes that were still alive survived because of
this sage. (The account of the myth forgot to mention that poor Brahmâ was
saved as well.) Âstîka blessed the snakes that had already died so that they
attained heaven.
Janamejaya received an unusual blessing from Vyâsa: that he could see his
father. Vyâsa called not only Parîkshit down from heaven (svarga) but also
S ́amîka, upon whom Parîkshit had thrown a dead snake and whose son Gavijâta
had cursed the king. Later Vyâsa was the presiding priest when King Janamejaya
performed the prestigious horse sacrifice (as ́va-medha yâjña).

JARA, JARAS
A hunter who killed Krishna
According to one version in the Bhâgavata Purâna Jara was hunting and shot an
arrow through a bush at the sound of an animal. But the blind shot hit S ́rî
Krishna in the foot, that only area of his body not protected by the magical
potion from the sage Durvâsa. (For more details of this version, see the entries
for Durvâsa and Krishna.)
There is a completely different version. The hunter, Jara, was the demon
Bâli, who had been killed by Râma and in this rebirth killed Krishna in revenge.

JARÂSANDHA
An evil king
Jarâsandha, mighty king of Magadha, was born by double magic, first from a
brâhmin and second from a giant demoness (râkshasî). His parents had been
childless. They enlisted the sage Kakshîvân (some texts say Candakaushika) to
help. As the sage meditated, a mango fell in his lap. He gave the mango to the
king, who in turn gave half to each of his wives. They became pregnant. But
when they delivered, each gave birth to half a child. They threw these misshapen
globs of flesh outside the palace, where the râkshasî Jarâ found them. In putting
them together as one perfect boy, she gave her name to him—Jarâsandha, “the
one joined together by Jarâ.”
Jarâsandha became a very powerful but wicked king. His two daughters were
married to Krishna’s uncle, King Kamsa. When Krishna killed Kamsa, the daugh
ters went to their father, Jarâsandha, and provoked him into attacking Krishna.
Finally after more than eighteen battles detailed in the Mahâbhârata and the
Bhâgavata Purâna, Bhîma killed Jarâsandha in a duel.

JATÂYU
A bird
Jatâyu was one of two sons born to Aruna, chariot driver of Sûrya (the sun god),
and Shyenî, a divine bird. In his youth Jatâyu was saved by his brother Sampâti
as they raced toward the sun, Sampâti allowing his wings to be burned as he
shielded Jatâyu from the sun. It was Jatâyu’s role to inform Râma that Sîtâ had
been abducted by Râvana. Jatâyu saw Râvana escaping with Sîtâ through the air
in his celestial chariot. Jatâyu intercepted Râvana, and a great air battle ensued.
Râvana eventually cut off Jatâyu’s wings. S ́rî Râma and Lakshmana discovered
the dying Jatâyu and learned about Râvana—and Sîtâ’s abduction. Jatâyu died
chanting Râma’s name. S ́rî Râma and Lakshmana lit his funeral pyre. The celes
tial bird’s soul gained liberation (svarga).

JÂYA, JAYAS
One of the dvarapâlakas (doorkeepers) of Vishnu
One day a group of hermits led by Sanaka came to Vaikuntha to see Vishnu.
They were stopped by Vishnu’s doorkeepers, Jâya and Vijâya. But the sages took
offense and cursed the doorkeepers to be reborn three times as demons (asuras).
The frightened doorkeepers begged the angry brâhmins for forgiveness, but they
only slightly lessened the punishment: after their three rebirths they would be
redeemed by the weapon of Mahâvishnu.
In the first birth they were born as Hiranyâksha and Hiranyakas ́ipu. In the
second birth they were born as Râvana and Kumbhakarna, and in the third birth
they were born as S ́is ́upâla and Dantavaktra. After their three births they
returned to Vaikuntha to serve Lord Vishnu.

KA
A letter
Ka is the first consonant in the Sanskrit alphabet, although, since Sanskrit is a
syllabic language, one should say that it is the first consonantal-syllabic. Ka is
also the ordinary word for who. It was used in an agnostic hymn of the Rigveda
that asked “who” created all this, and when it had become inconceivable that a
Vedic hymn should be agnostic, it became a symbol of and word for the creator:
Prajâpati according to the Mahâbhârata and Brahmâ according to Agni Purâna.

KABANDHA
A demon
In the Râma myth cycle in his previous life Kabandha was a gandharva called
Visvâvasu. He was born to a gandharva called S ́rî Vis ́vâvasu, who was also
known by the name Danu. Vis ́vâvasu performed a penance (tapas) and received
the boon of immortality from Brahmâ. Arrogant about this boon, Vis ́vâvasu then
attacked Indra. In the great battle that followed Indra used his divine discus
(Vajrâyudha). The head and thighs of Vis ́vâvasu were squeezed into his body,
and his mouth was pushed down to his abdomen. Upon Vis ́vâvasu’s pleading,
Indra gave him two long hands and said that he would regain his original form
when S ́rî Râma cut off these hands. Because he did not have a head, only two
166 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



long hands and a mouth on his belly, he came to be known as Kabandha, “the
headless.” Often he was depicted as a tree.
The fateful day came when Kabandha encountered S ́rî Râma and Laksh
mana in the forest. They were searching for Sîtâ. Before them appeared the hor
rible form of Kabandha, large as a mountain. The demon grabbed S ́rî Râma in
his right hand and Lakshmana in his left. Each cut off one hand. Kabandha
then told them his story and fell dead. S ́rî Râma and Lakshmana burned his
body on a funeral pyre, and as Kabandha ascended from its flames, he told S ́rî
Râma and Lakshmana to go to Sugrîva, the monkey king, from whom they
could learn more about Sîtâ’s abduction. Kabandha was again Vis ́vâvasu, a gan
dharva king.

KACA
The son of the sage Brihaspati
The asuras (demons) had become invincible in war because their priest, the
brâhmin S ́ukra, knew the art of bringing the dead back to life (mritasañjîvinî).
No sooner would the devas (gods) kill the asuras than S ́ukra would perform the
mritasañjîvinî and they were alive again. The devas dispatched their chief
priest’s son, Kaca, to learn this magic. Kaca presented himself so humbly in ask
ing to become his disciple that S ́ukra could not refuse. Even S ́ukra’s daughter,
Devayânî, fell in love with Kaca. They became an inseparable couple. However,
the asuras were not happy that the son of Brihaspati was at S ́ukra’s as ́rama
(hermitage). One day they had their chance and killed him when he was in the
forest looking for stray cattle. The asuras fed his body to wolves. Devayânî
pleaded with her father to perform the mritasañjîvinî. Kaca was called back to
life, and everything returned to normal, until the asuras killed him again. Kaca
was again called back to life. But the third time the asuras killed him, they
burned his body, mixed his ashes in S ́ukra’s wine, and got S ́ukra to drink it.
Again Devayânî pleaded for her lover’s life.
S ́ukra could think of only one way to save Kaca. He communicated with
Kaca in meditation and taught him the magical formula, the mritasañjîvinî.
When S ́ukra performed it, Kaca came forth from S ́ukra’s belly, splitting him
open. Then Kaca performed the mritasañjîvinî and restored his teacher to life.
Now Kaca knew the magical art and was ready to return to the devas. Devayânî
was in love with him and pleaded to become his wife. But Kaca rejected her, so
she cursed him to not be able to use the mritasañjîvinî. Kaca cursed her back,
saying that no brâhmin would marry her. Kaca was able to get around
Devayânî’s curse by teaching his disciples how to use the mritasañjîvinî and

KAIKEYÎ
One of the wives of King Das ́aratha of Ayodhyâ
Kaikeyî was one of the three (some versions say five) wives of King Das ́aratha.
She had been a princess of the kingdom of Kekaya, seven day’s journey from
Ayodhyâ. When Das ́aratha was summoned to svarga (heaven) to help the devas
(gods) in a war with the asuras (demons), Kaikeyî rode with him in his war char
iot and helped him. The asura S ́ambara used sorcery (black magic) to attack
Das ́aratha and the devas from ten thousand directions at the same time. So
Das ́aratha had to fight in ten thousand directions at the same time. As he was
doing that, a lynch pin on one wheel of his chariot fell off, and the wheel seemed
about to be lost—along with the battle. But Kaikeyî inserted her thumb into the
hole so that the wheel stayed on. When Das ́aratha discovered his wife’s bravery,
he granted her two boons. Wisely, she saved them.
Years later, evil advice from a hunchback maid named Manthurâ darkened
her heart. Das ́aratha was preparing to anoint as heir-apparent his son, Râma, by
his first wife Kausalyâ. Kaikeyî demanded her two boons: that Râma be exiled to
the forest for fourteen years and that her son Bharata be anointed heir-apparent.
It was done. But Das ́aratha died almost immediately.

the mythmakers gave her both good and bad roles in which her character vacil
lated between praise and blame.

KAILÂSA
The celestial abode of S ́iva and Pârvatî
The Mahâbhârata describes the location of Kailâsa. Kailâsa is situated on the
southern side of Mahâmeru (Mahâ-Meru), the great mountain. It is said that
there are two celestial abodes on Mount Kailâsa, one of S ́iva and Pârvatî and the
other of Kubera, god of wealth.

KAITABHA
An asura (demon)
There are two versions of the origin of Kaitabha and his brother Madhu. The ver
sion in the Purânas said that Madhu and his brother Kaitabha were born from
the earwax of Vishnu. Vishnu was ending his cosmic sleep reclined upon the ser
pent S ́esha (also called Ananta) floating on the Milky Ocean. Brahmâ emerged
from the lotus that grew from Vishnu’s navel. Some earwax emerged from each
of Vishnu’s ears, which became the two demons known as Madhu and Kaitabha.
According to the Mahâbhârata version, the two demons were born from the
two drops of water trapped in the lotus that came from Vishnu’s navel. Madhu
had the attribute (guna) of darkness (tamas), while Kaitabha’s attribute was
activity (rajas).
Kaitabha and Madhu were taught a mantra of praise to Devî (the Mother),
which they used for a thousand years. Pleased, Devî appeared to them and gave
them a boon. They asked to die only of their own choosing. They became bored
with the world before creation, a world that was totally submerged, so they
decided to cause trouble. They stole the entire Vedas and plunged into the dark
waters and reached Pâtâla (the underworld). Brahmâ had to waken Lord Vishnu,
so he did it with praise. Vishnu agreed to retrieve the Vedas. Vishnu fought the
haughty demons but was not able to win. Then he understood that they were
invincible because of Devî’s boon. So Vishnu called a truce and told Kaitabha
and Madhu that he was pleased with them and would grant them a boon. But
they mocked Vishnu and said they did not need anything from him, as they were
more powerful than he was. So Vishnu said that if that was so, then they should
grant him a boon. Without any fear, they said that they would. Vishnu crafted
his boon carefully, asking that they grant him the boon to kill them.
The honorable demons had to keep their promise, but they placed one stip
ulation on their boon: that Vishnu could not kill them in water, since every
thing was flooded. So Vishnu expanded himself, and the demons found
themselves high and dry on Vishnu’s thigh. They enlarged themselves to be
able to get their feet back into the cosmic ocean. But this time Vishnu’s expan
sion was so great that the demons were unable to touch the ocean. Vishnu cut
off their heads with his discus. The fat that flowed from their bodies coagulated
on the sea and became the earth. That was how the earth received its name as
Medinî (“having fatness”). They were reborn as Khara and Atikâya for more
roles in later mythology.

KAKSHASENA
A righteous king
King Kakshasena, praised as an examplar in the Mahâbhârata, was the son of
King Parîkshit and grandson of King Avîkshit. Kakshasena achieved an honored
place in Hindu mythology because of his generous support of the priesthood. The
lists of such donors included great kings of the epic period: Shibi, Pratardana,
Rantideva, Ambarîsha, Paras ́u-Râma, S ́rî Râma, and a few others. King Kak
shasena was said to have attained heaven because of his generosity to the brâh
min Vasishtha.

KAKSHÎVÂN, KAKSHÎVÂT
A sage mentioned in the Rigveda
The story of Kakshîvân is quite fragmentary, with some pieces quite ancient
mixed with pieces from later mythology.
Kakshîvân was born according to a custom by which a priest would be
requested to give the king a child by his childless queen. King Kalinga was with
out an heir. He consulted the sage Dîrghatamas and requested that he give him
a son by his queen. But the queen did not want to sleep with the old, and prob
ably smelly, sage. So she sent her maid Ushî instead. Kakshîvân was born of
their union. This version was told in the Rigveda.
There was another version of the birth of Kakshîvân in the Mahâbhârata.
This time Kakshîvân was born to a sage named Gautama (but not the Gautama
who was married to Ahalyâ) and a s ́udra woman who lived in the land of Usînara.
The As ́vin twins once gave Kakshîvân a hundred pots of liquor to test his
strength, according to a verse in the Rigveda.
According to the Mahâbhârata, Kakshîvân was one of the seven Barhishads,
who were created by Brahmâ to teach Indra. Kakshîvân had completed his part
of the training and was returning home. When night came, he slept by the road
side. The next morning he was found by King Bhâvayavya who, upon question
ing him, found him so worthy that he gave Kakshîvân his ten daughters in
marriage and loaded him down with gold, horses, cattle, and chariots. Kakshîvân
arrived back at his father’s home and wrote many hymns of praise. Kakshîvân
had two daughters, Kâkshîvatasutâ and Bhadrâ.

KÂKSHÎVATASUTÂ
A woman sage
Kâkshîvatasutâ was one of two daughters of the brâhmin Kakshîvân. Kâkshî
vatasutâ (also known as Ghoshâ) contracted leprosy. She had mastered hymn
writing and composed a mantra that praised the physicians of the gods, the
As ́vins. They responded to her praise and cured her. She then was able to marry.
Bhadrâ, Kakshîvatasutâ’s sister, married King Vyûshitâshva, who died
before they had children. Her lamentations were so great that Vyûshitâshva was
called from the dead, and she was able to have six sons because of her austerities
(tapas).

KÂLA
The god (deva) of death; time
As time is a great imponderable, it is related to death. The two words, time and
death, are the same in Sanskrit. Kâla is popularly known as Yama. Born from the
union of Sûrya (the sun god) and Samjñâ, daughter of Kas ́yapa-prajâpati, Yama
(Kâla) was given the duty to retrieve the souls of those whose allotted time was
at an end.
After death the spirit of the body was taken by the attendants of Kâla to his
court, and there the spirit was judged according to the virtue (dharma, punya)
and vice that had shown in action in that lifetime. Depending on the judgment,
the spirit (pitri) was sent to Vaikuntha (heaven) or Naraka (also called Pitriloka,
the land of the spirits).
Kâla was one of the Dikpâlakâs, a guardian of the four cardinal directions.
He guarded the southern quarter. His city was called Samyaminî (and Yamapurî).
In the Katha Upanishad there was a discussion between a lad named Naciketas
and Kâla (Yama) about the nature of death and that which is deathless.
In late Purânic mythology like that found in the Vishnu Purâna, there were
twenty-eight Narakas (hells), each more terrible than the one before, with ever
increasing punishment and torments.
Kâla (Yama) fared just as badly as some of the other devas, like Indra in later
mythology. He was ruled by the laws of karma, could be defeated by the magic
of sages or the austerities of demons like Râvana, and was fooled by the play
(lîlâ) of supreme deities.

KÂLANEMI
A demon
Kâlanemi was a râkshasa (night-wandering demon) who was dispatched by the
asura (demon) king Râvana to prevent Hanuman, the monkey god and loyal ser
vant of Râma, from reaching the magic Drona mountain. Hanuman needed heal
ing herbs for the wounded Lakshmana during the Râma-Râvana war. Kâlanemi
appeared as a brâhmin in order to fool Hanuman, but this shape-shifting demon
got himself killed in the process.
He also had a lifetime during the Krishna incarnation as Kamsa, the evil
uncle of Krishna.

KALÂVATÎ
Daughter of the king of Kâs ́i
Kalâvatî worshipped the sage Durvâsa and was given the powerful five-syllable
mantra (pancâkshara mantra) in praise of S ́iva (s ́ivayah namah). By its use Kalâ
vatî became a saint.
Kalâvatî married King Dâhârha of Mathurâ. When he approached her, he
noticed that he became overheated. Kalâvatî told him that, because of the
mantra, sinners would feel hot if they touched her. The king consented to go
with Kalâvatî to the brâhmin Garga. The king bathed in the Kâlindî River, and
his sins flew away as tiny birds. When they next embraced, Kalâvatî’s body was
cool, and they had a son.

KALI
The son of Kas ́yâpa and his wife Muni
Kali (strife) was the personification of evil (adharma), as well as the worst throw
in a game of Indian dice. He could also be called the god of sin and of bad luck.
Kali was born as the fifteenth of sixteen sons of Kas ́yâpa and his wife Muni.
In an encounter with King Parîkshit, Kali was cursed to be confined to five
places on earth: gambling, drinking, woman, murder, and gold. According to the
Bhâgavata Purâna Kali is the ruling power in the Kali Yuga—the present age.

KÂLÎ
A goddess (devî); the anger of
Umâ, or Pârvatî
In the Vedic period Kâlî (the
black one) was one of the
seven tongues of Agni, god of
the sacrificial fire. She was the
black fire, though the specific
meaning has been lost. She
was referred to as one of the
seven mothers of Agni—who
nurtured him. There were also
seven mothers (Mâtrikâs)
whose natures seem far from
Vedic rituals. Yet as she devel
oped Kâlî seemed to combine
both orthoprax Brâhmanical
religion and the heteroprax
religion of the cremation
grounds. She was the dark
side of Devî, the Great God
dess (Mahâdevî), assimilating
tribal and non-Aryan god
desses and their myths.
The “hottest” (least
orthodox) of all the manifes
tations of Mahâdevî is Kâlî.
She is the anger of Umâ, or
Pârvatî, S ́iva’s wife. She
demands offerings of wine,
meat, and blood. Animal sac
rifices are still performed to
her at her temples in Calcutta, in Nepal, and in the villages in non-orthoprax rit
uals. At the village level any of the hot goddesses may be seen as Kâlî—Câmundâ
who drank up the blood of the demon Raktabîja (bloody seed), whose blood was
the seed of more demons; the Sapta-mâtrikâs (seven mothers); and even lesser
goddess of smallpox and disease like S ́îtalâ and Mâriyamman. For many Kâlî and
Durgâ are synonymous. Both have a lion as their vahana (vehicle), both kill
Mahisha, both are goddesses that dance on their husband, S ́iva.
In some myths Kâlî appears as a voluptuous woman enticing both
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 173

from the nineteenth century (The Art Archive / Victoria
and Albert Museum London / Eileen Tweedy)



demons and wicked warriors—only to reveal herself as an opponent who
beheads men almost as a whim. Only male offerings can be presented to her
and beheaded in her blood sacrifices. It is no secret that she symbolically cas
trates her victims.
In Tantra Kâlî’s worship embraced the five pollutants, known as the “five
m’s” (pañcamakâra)—madya (wine), matsya (fish), mâmsa (meat), mudrâ
(parched grain), and maithuna (sexual union). These could be utilized symboli
cally in right-handed worship (dakshinâcâra) or trangressively in left-handed
worship (vâmâcâra). Worship of Kâlî was dangerous, as her many bloody myths
warned, but the rewards could be great.

KÂLINDÎ
A river and a goddess (devî)
Kâlindî was the daughter of Sûrya, the sun god. She was blessed to become a
sacred river, also known as the Yamunâ. It flowed from the Kalinda mountain
and entered the Gangâ at Prayâga, a very sacred confluence.
At the birth of Krishna, his father Vasudeva had to switch the infants of his
two wives. He had to cross a flooding Kâlindî River. The goddess of the river
miraculously helped him cross back and forth with the babies.
There is a strange story in the Bhâgavata (Skandha Ten) about Balabhadra
Râma, Krishna’s brother and a divine incarnation in some lists, and the Kâlindî.
Balabhadra Râma had had a little too much liquor to drink and was playing with
the cowherd girls (gopis). He wanted to swim with them so he had to pull the
Kâlindî over to them with his plough.
The Bhâgavata Purâna stated that Krishna and Arjuna were walking
together along the Kâlindî and saw a beautiful woman, who turned out to be
Kâlindî herself, practicing austerities (tapas). Arjuna learned that she was doing
these in order to gain Krishna as her husband. When Arjuna told Krishna,
Krishna took the goddess Kâlindî in his chariot to Dvârakâ and married her.
Krishna and Kâlindî had ten sons.
There was a story in Vâmana Purâna saying that Kâma-deva (the god of
love) shot some of his love arrows at S ́iva, when S ́iva was very depressed over the
death of Satî. S ́iva became so excited that he jumped into the river Kâlindî—and
that is why its water is black. In Agni Purâna the goddess Kâlindî was depicted
as black in color and riding on a tortoise, carrying a water pitcher in her hand.
174 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



According to Padma Purâna the river Kâlindî was so holy that to drink her
water or bathe in her divine flow would purify anyone from their sins and give
them the merit (punya) to gain heaven (svarga).

KALIPRIYÂ
A prostitute
The story of Kalipriyâ is brief but nonetheless important. It represents the point
of view of the devotional groups and the abundant grace (prasâda) that they
promised. Kalipriyâ was absolved of her sins and received the merit (punya) to
offset all her bad karma simply by performing a month-long fast (kârtika vrata).
The Padma Purâna did not say that she achieved liberation (moksha) but stated
that she gained a rebirth in heaven (svarga), the hope of devotionalists (bhaktas),
who longed to be with their supreme lord.

KÂLIYA
A serpent
In the Krishna myth cycle Kâliya was a great serpent, born of the progenitor
Kas ́yâpa by his wife Kadrû, mother of the serpent kingdom. Kâliya lived in the
Kâlindî River (also called the Yamunâ) and was well known because of his asso
ciation with Krishna. Kâliya had a thousand hoods (although some texts say only
five). One late version added that Kâliya was reborn as the asura (demon)
Kâlanemi. While other Nâgas (serpents) had made an arrangement not to be
eaten by Garuda, the sun eagle, Kâliya and his clan were protected by a boon that
they could not be eaten by Garuda as long as they were in the Kâlindî. So they
gave no offerings or tribute to Garuda.
Kâliya’s poison became so strong that the entire Kâlindî River became poi
sonous, and trees along its banks died. One day the cowherds, gopîs and gopâlas,
drank from its water and died. (One version said it was the cows that died.) S ́rî
Krishna became furious and attacked Kâliya. Krishna jumped from a tree upon
the head of the giant, multiheaded serpent and danced on his head (the Kâliya
mardhana, dance). Beaten into submission, Kâliya and all his wives and children
took refuge in Lord Krishna. Krishna blessed them and sent them to an island
kingdom in the sea with the boon that Garuda still could not eat them there.
From that time on Kâliya and his clan lived on Ramanaka Island. And of course
the dead (gopîs or cows) were brought back to life, not by magical formulas or
Brâhmanical rituals but by the will of Lord Krishna.

KALKI
The tenth avatâra of Vishnu
Kalki is the form that Vishnu will assume at the end of this cosmic age, the Kali
Yuga. As Kalki, Vishnu will appear in a human form riding on a white horse. He
will bring a fiery end to the world, reward the virtuous, and punish the wicked.
With his advent, evil will disappear, and the Krita Yuga (also known as the Satya
Yuga, the age of truth) will begin again.

KALMÂSHAPÂDA
A king of the Ikshvaku dynasty
Kalmâshapâda (one with polluted feet) was the name given a great king who had
been turned into a man-eating râkshasa (night-wandering demon). Before the
curse, he was Mitrasaha, king of Ayodhyâ, who lived in happiness with his beau
tiful queen Madayantî. There are three versions of how he was cursed.
The first version began on a hunt when King Mitrasaha killed a tiger cub that
was really a râkshasa. The demon’s brother took revenge by taking the shape of a
brâhmin named Vasishtha and going to Mitrasaha’s palace to perform an as ́va
medha (horse sacrifice). The râkshasa, in the form of the presiding priest
Vasishtha, asked the king to fix him a meat meal and bring it to his tent. Unknow
ingly Mitrasaha took the meat meal to the real Vasishtha, and the sage cursed the
king and transformed him into a râkshasa.
The second version began with a hunt and the accidental killing of a râkshasa.
Again the brother râkshasa took the form of a brâhmin cook. Vasishtha arrived,
and a meal was needed for the sage. This time the cook prepared human flesh, and
the king served it to the sage Vasishtha. Mitrasaha was cursed to become a man
eating râkshasa for twelve years. In the third version Mitrasaha was on a hunt. He
met S ́aktî, the son of Vasishtha, on the trail. Both thought the other should step
off the path. Finally, the king struck the brâhmin with his whip. In anger, S ́aktî
cursed him, and another sage, Vis ́vâmitra, put a devil into the king’s body. The
king immediately became a râkshasa.
In one account King Mitrasaha tried to get even with Vasishtha for cursing
him. Mitrasaha took water and was going to throw it down with a curse. How
ever, the queen stopped him with the warning that it was not right to curse a
brâhmin. So he threw the “cursed water” on his own feet, thus acquiring the
name Kalmâshapâda, “one with polluted feet.”
As a man-eating râkshasa, Kalmâshapâda was quite successful. He ate all
one hundred of Vasishtha’s sons, including S ́aktî. Kalmâshapâda lived as a
râkshasa for twelve years and had many adventures. Finally, at the end of
176 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



twelve years he was returned to his original form by the blessing of Vasishtha
himself.

KÂMA, KÂMADEVA
The god (deva) of love
There are two versions of Kâma’s birth. According to the Mahâbhârata, Kâma is
the son of Dharma, who was born from the right breast of Brahmâ. Dharma had
three sons: Kâma, S ́ama, and Harsha. All were very handsome like their father.
According to Kâlikâ Purâna, Kâma was born from the mind of Brahmâ.
Brahmâ created ten Prajâpatis (progenitors) first and then an exceptional woman
called Sandhyâ. When Sandhyâ was born, Brahmâ and the ten Prajâpatis were
very much attracted by her beauty. At that moment of excitement a handsome
youth sprang from the mind of Brahmâ holding a bow of flowers and arrows of
sugarcane. The youth asked: “Whom shall I make excited?” And Brahmâ
answered that he should excite men with kâma (love, desire).
Kâma was blamed by many versions of the myth for Brahmâ’s creation of
and marriage to Sarasvatî. She was mind-born from the creator—from his medi
tation. But then Brahmâ fell in love and married his own daughter, Sarasvatî. For
this, he blamed Kâma, who, Brahmâ said, had excited him with his magic
arrows. So Brahmâ cursed Kâma to be turned into ashes by the fire of the third
eye of S ́iva. (For more see the entry on Pârvatî.)
Kâma’s greatest moment was when he was sent by Indra to wake up S ́iva so
that he could deal with Târaka, the great asura (demon) troubling the world. S ́iva
was angry and burned Kâma to a crisp. Kâma’s wife Ratî pleaded with S ́iva to
restore Kâma to life. But all that S ́iva would do was to give Ratî a rebirth as
mother of a reborn Kâma who was reborn as Pradyumna. (See more in the entry
on Rukhmini, Ratî’s name when she was reborn.)

KÂMADHENU
The celestial cow
Kâmadhenu was born of Kas ́yâpa and his wife Krodhavasâ. Kâmadhenu (desire
fulfilling milk cow) gave milk to the devas (gods), at any time and in any quan
tity they wanted. She was also known as Surabhî (the fragrant) and Nandinî
(delight). The family of cattle came from Kâmadhenu. (Another source stated
that Surabhî was the calf of Kâmadhenu.)
In the Mahâbhârata Surabhî worshipped Brahmâ for a thousand years and
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 177



was blessed with divinity: she became a goddess and received her own world,
Goloka (the celestial heaven of cows). Some late myths put Kâmadhenu in the
possession of the sage Vasishtha. In one such myth, Satyavrata stole and killed
Kâmadhenu, eating part of her body and giving the rest to the starving family of
Vis ́vâmitra. Vasishtha cursed Satyavrata as one who had committed the three
worst sins (Tris ́anku—according to this account, killing a brâhmin, one’s
teacher, and a cow). Vasishtha then restored Kâmadhenu to life.

KAMSA, KANSA
Uncle of S ́rî Krishna
The myth of Kamsa is told in a series of nested myths that are an excellent study
of karma as a process over many lifetimes. But its primary location is within the
Krishna myth cycle, where Kamsa plays a role in Krishna’s nativity and his first
great battle with evil (though in previous lives Krishna had already fought bat
tles with demons of all sorts before the one with Kamsa).
Kamsa’s karmic chain began at the beginning of a new cosmic creation.
Kamsa was a rebirth of Kâlanemi, a son of Virocana, an asura (demon) and the
brother of Bali. After that rebirth as an evil human, his next rebirth was as
Kâliya, a serpent king.
Kâlanemi had had six sons, who were reborn from a curse by Brahmâ. The
six sons had a karmic chain that brought them into contact with Krishna. They
had been reborn as sons of Kâlanemi because of what had happened in their pre
vious lifetime. Brahmâ had created Marîci, whose life remains clouded in some
mystery. His greatness cannot be doubted, but some say that he was one of the
Maruts (gods associated with Indra, thus gods of storms and battle). Others say
that he was a Prajâpati (progenitor, or grandfather), or even one of the seven
mahârishis, who were also the seven cosmic principles. According to the Bhâ
gavata Purâna Marîci (light) and Ûrnâ married (in the Brahmânda Purâna his
wife was Anasûyâ, “without spite”) and had six sons so powerful that they
rivaled the creator. One day when they saw Brahmâ, they mocked him, saying
that he was a father who had married his own daughter (Sarasvatî). Brahmâ
cursed them to be born as demons. And thus these six had rebirths in two impor
tant incarnations of Vishnu as sons of demons—first of Kâlanemi and then of
Hiranyakas ́ipu—and in one as humans, as sons of Vasudeva and Devakî.
As sons of Hiranyakas ́ipu the six brothers were pious and even received a
boon from Brahmâ, that no one could kill them. But Hiranyakas ́ipu cursed them
to sleep in Pâtâla (the underworld). After much pleading by his sons, he changed
178 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



the curse so that they would be reborn as the first six sons of Devakî, so that
their father in their previous life, Kâlanemi, who was going to be reborn as
Kamsa, would be their uncle in the next lifetime and could kill them. That
would allow another rebirth, which was better than being stuck in Pâtâla.
So the karmic chain of events brought Kâlanemi and the six sons of Marîci
into a human rebirth. Kamsa was born as the son of Ugrasena, the king of Math
urâ. The meddling sage Nârada told Kamsa that he was the result of a rape of his
mother by a gandharva named Dramila, and that that was why his mother hated
him and cursed him to be killed by a member of his own family. So Kamsa was
not really surprised at the wedding of his sister Devakî when a voice from
heaven said that his sister’s eighth son would kill him. Kamsa drew his sword
and would have killed her, had not her husband Vasudeva pledged to give him
each of the sons when they were born. So began intermittent imprisonments of
the couple and the killing of their first six sons, who were being reborn to work
out karma going all the way back to their sin of mocking the creator.
Kamsa personally bashed the brains out of each baby boy. Kamsa’s rule of
Mathurâ became more and more evil. The seventh child was a girl and an incar
nation of Mâyâdevî. Even though the seventh birth was not a boy, Kamsa tried
to smash her head against the ground. But she rose into the air and announced
that Kamsa’s death was near.
S ́rî Krishna was born as the eighth son of Devakî and Vasudeva. Kamsa tried
many ways to kill S ́rî Krishna—all of which failed. Finally, he was slain by
Krishna when an attempted ambush backfired. For the details about how
Balarâma and Krishna escaped death at the hands of Kamsa, see their entries as
well as that of Devakî.

KANDU
A sage of Purânic fame
Kandu appeared in the Vishnu Purâna as the archetype of sages who lose their
focus. He was called chief of the devajñas (ones who know the divine). His pow
erful austerities (tapas) caused Indra to worry that Kandu would become more
powerful than himself, the king of the gods. So Indra sent one of heaven’s
temptresses, the apsara (celestial damsel) Pramlocâ, to distract Kandu from his
practice (sâdhana). He moved with her from the banks of the Gomatî River to
the Mandara valley and lived with her for a century enjoying conjugal bliss. After
that century, and the next and the next, Pramlocâ asked if she could take leave,
but Kandu insisted that she stay and enjoyed her more each day. One evening he
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 179



noticed that the sun was setting and he prepared to do his normal Brâhmanical
duty (sandhyâvandana) with a prayer (ariti) to the setting sun. Pramlocâ asked
why tonight, since he had never done it before while they were together. Kandu
protested, saying that he never missed doing any of his practices—and, besides,
they had only met that morning.
When Pramlocâ finally convinced him that they had been together for many
years, Kandu was shocked to learn the exact amount of time—nine hundred
years, six months, and three days. Kandu became very angry and shouted at his
former lover. Then he sent her away forever, so that he could try to start acquir
ing merit (punya) and power (siddhis) anew. As she left, flying up through the
trees, her perspiration was left on the leaves of the trees of the forest, and the
wind (Vâyu) gathered the droplets together into a woman. Mârishâ, “nursed by
the trees,” was given the name Vârkshî and later married ten husbands (the Pra
cetases), according to a Mahâbhârata account. And in a Bhâgavata Purâna ver
sion Vârkshî became the mother of Daksha (ritual skill), father-in-law of S ́iva.
Kandu must have lost all his powers. He got only minor roles in stories after
that. Losing his sixteen-year-old son in a forest, Kandu cursed the forest to
become a desert, a desert that was later found by Hanuman. And he was just one
of the many sages invited by Râma to his court when Râma began his divine rule
of Ayodhyâ.

In the Rigveda Kanva was part of Kas ́yapa’s family. His father was Medhâtithi.
Kanva became a teacher with many disciples at his as ́rama (hermitage) on the
Mâlinî River in the Himâlayas. He was credited with writing as many as fifty
chapters of the first section (mandala) and the entire tenth section of the
Rigveda.
In the Mahâbhârata Kanva had an as ́rama on the Parvenu River. One day
Kanva discovered S ́akuntalâ (one raised by the birds). This little girl had been
abandoned by her parents, the great brâhmin sage Vis ́vâmitra and the celestial
temptress Menakâ. Indra had sent Menakâ to spoil Vis ́vâmitra’s austerities, and
the fruit of their dalliance was abandoned but kept alive by the birds.
Many of the Purânas used another name for Kanva, that of Kas ́yapa. This
led to quite a few mistakes when events about Kas ́yapa-Prajâpati—who would
have lived about twenty generations prior to this Kas ́yapa (Kanva)—are con
fused. One of those confusions occurred around which sage was bribed so that
the giant serpent Takshâka would be successful in killing King Parîkshit. It

should not have been Kanva. Besides his excellence as a hymnist, his major
fame was his adopted daughter, S ́akuntalâ, who became the subject of love sto
ries in every Indian language.

KAPILA
A powerful brâhmin, a philosopher, a magician
Kapila, the historical founder of the Samkhya school of philosophy (dars ́ana),
lived long enough before the Epics and Purânas only to have his name be coopted
and given a set of myths. In the Purânas Kapila became a master yogi as well as
a master magician. He was said to be a partial incarnation of Vishnu in one sec
tion of the Mahâbhârata and a worshipper of S ́iva in another.
Born very close to the beginning of this age, Kapila engaged in such severe
austerities (tapas) that he developed the power to incinerate things with a
glance. Some versions stated that Vishnu had incarnated to kill the sixty thou
sand sons of King Asamañjasa. Others make the sons’ own behavior in the pres
ence of a great sage the cause of their death. Kapila had chosen Pâtâla (hell) to
practice tapas. Meanwhile on earth, King Asamañjasa had lost his wild stallion
in the middle of a horse sacrifice (as ́va-medha). Indra had stolen it and hid it
beside Kapila. The king sent his sixty thousand sons throughout the world and
then into the netherworlds to find his horse. They found it near Kapila and dis
turbed his austerities. That seemed enough reason to incinerate all of them.
Their ashes lay in the underworld through four generations until King
Bhagîratha did two one-thousand-year penances in order to win the boon of
bringing the Gangâ to earth (and to hell, according to this version) with suffi
cient water to complete the funeral rituals.

KARMA (KARMAN)
A concept
Karma (or karman) is a concept that is central in Epic and Purânic mythology.
The term itself comes from the verbal root, kri, meaning “to act, to do, to bring
about.” In the Vedas, karma had referred to action performed in ritual and was
associated with the logic of Vedic fire sacrifices and Brâhmanical incantations
(mantras). But through succeeding periods karma came to mean any correct eth
ical activity and was connected to dharma (righteousness, duty). So many myths
explicitly connected rebirth, or transmigration (samsâra), with karma and
dharma that the three must be considered together. (See chapter 1 for more
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 181



details.) If one’s karma, in the sense of action, is in accord with dharma, one will
have “good karma” that will lead to a good rebirth. If one’s karma (action) is
adharmic, against dharma, the “bad karma” that results may play out in lifetime
after lifetime. A favorite saying used to explain karma to Westerners is “As ye
sow, so shall ye reap.”
Karma is discussed in chapter 1, “Mythic Themes: Specific” and in chapter
2. In fact, the entire second chapter is about the relationship of karma to kâla
des ́a-nimitta (the Hindu time-space-causality continuum). It is not the purpose
of this study to prove that karma functions differently over the centuries of
Hindu mythology, religion, and philosophy in Vedic rita (justice), Brâhmanical
ritualism (yajñâs, yâgas) with its ritual science (mâyâ), Upanishadic jñâna
(knowledge), Epic and Purânic tapas and their derived siddhis, Yogic sâdhanas,
and devotional bhakti and prâsada. It is the purpose of these chapters to alert
the reader to Hindu mythology’s use of a more mechanical or hard karma than
is taught by most Hindu philosophers and theologians.
The story of Kamsa, recounted in the entry of that name, illustrates well
how later mythology understood the workings of karma. The fruits of his
actions take effect over many lifetimes, flowing from one lifetime to the next.
Not only are his rebirths affected, but others are reborn over and over with him
in changing roles and genders to work out complicated causal chains of events.
One distinction might be of value: that between “hard” karma, a mechani
cal working out of karmic cause and effect, and “soft” karma, which allows for
grace or purification rituals to remove the effects of karma without full recom
pense by the individual. Not that the situation is that simple; rather there is a
continuum between these two extremes, with many cases falling somewhere in
the middle. Grace gained from devotion (bhakti) that softened karma was the
subject of many myths.

KARNA
Eldest son of Kuntî
In the Mahâbhârata war Karna had a divine birth. His mother, Kuntî, was the
daughter of King Shûrasena. As a girl Kuntî was in charge of arrangement in the
palace for religious rituals. During a period of four months when the sage
Durvâsa performed rituals for the king, Kuntî served him so well that Durvâsa
182 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



gave her a wondrous mantra. She could only use it five times, but it had the
power to call forth a god and to allow her to bear a child by that god that would
have his qualities. Her curiosity got the better of her, and she chanted the
mantra focusing on the sun. Sûrya descended from the sun in human form, told
her that she would not lose her virginity, and gave her a son. Kuntî was able to
keep the child a secret with the help of her stepmother, putting the baby into a
box and sending it down the river As ́vâ. The box floated into the Yamunâ and
then into the Gangâ. It was pulled from the river by King Dhritarâshthra’s char
ioteer, Adhiratha, and taken to his childless wife Râdhâ. Karna was brought up
by these foster parents in the country of Anga. Later Karna went to Hastinâpura
and studied archery with the great master (âcârya) Drona. Karna lied about his
lineage in order to study under another great teacher, Paras ́urâma. He became an
ally of Duryodhana and fought on the side of the Kauravas. In the Kurukshetra
battle he was a heroic fighter but was eventually killed by Arjuna. After he went
to heaven, he merged with his father, Sûrya.

KÂRTTIKEYA
Son of S ́iva and Pârvatî, god of war; the planet Mars
Kârttikeya’s name derived from his having been raised by the six Krittikâs, the
name given to six of the seven wives of the seven mahârishis. He was also
named Skanda and Subrahmanya.
Kârttikeya appeared in the epics, the Mahâbhârata and the Râmâyana, as a
son fathered by S ́iva without being born from the womb of a woman. S ́iva’s seed
landed in the fire, and Agni transported it to the river goddess Gangâ. But the
seed became too hot for Gangâ, so Kârttikeya was born on the shore in a thicket.
From this birth two of his mythic names were derived: Agni-bhû (born of fire)
and Gangâ-ja (descendant of Gangâ). Some versions assigned his birth to Pârvatî,
as S ́iva’s principal wife.
He had six heads and was born with the purpose of destroying the terrible
demon Târaka, son of Ditî. He rode on a peacock named Paravânî. His wife was
Kaumârî, or Senâ. He was never as popular as S ́iva’s other son, Ganes ́a. As a war
rior he was called Mahâ-sena (great conquering army) and Senâ-pati (lord of a
conquering army); he was also called Kumâra (boy—one who is always young),
Guha (mysterious one), S ́aktî-dhara (spear holder), Gangâ-putra (son of the
Gangâ), Sara-bhû (born in the thicket), Târaka-jit (vanquisher of Târaka).

KAS ́YAPA
A prajâpati (progenitor) who fathered all beings; a sage
Kas ́yapa-Prajâpati has a major role in creation. However, there were variations
concerning his birth and his status. In the Mahâbhârata Kas ́yapa was only the
son of Marîci, who was one of the six mind-born sons (mânasâ-putras) of
Brahmâ. The Vâlmîki Râmâyana added Kas ́yapa as the seventh and youngest
sons of Brâhma and thus a brother of Marîci. Thus, Kas ́yapa was either the son
or grandson of Brahmâ.
As chief of the prajâpatis, Kas ́yapa was the primary progenitor of this cre
ation. Kas ́yapa married twenty-one daughters of Daksha (See entry on Daksha to
see how the mythmakers saw Daksha as an âditya, thus a son of Kas ́yapa, or
born from the thumb of Brahmâ.) Kas ́yapa was the father of both the devas (gods)
and the asuras (demons). His more important wives were Aditi, whose children
were the âdityas (gods, devas), and Ditî, whose children were the daityas
(demons, asuras). His main daitya children were Hiranyakas ́ipu, Hiranyâksha,
and Simhikâ. Kas ́yapa’s wife Danu gave birth to the Dânavas: Kapila, S ́ankara,
and Târaka were among those who gained fame. Surabhî gave him another order
of children including Rudra (a storm god) and Tvashthri (the divine architect).
Vinatâ gave birth to Garuda (king of the birds) and the bird kingdom, while
Kadrû became mother of the Nâgas, the serpent kingdom.
There were an astonishing number of appearances and roles that Kas ́yapa
was given in late myths. These are distributed over three rebirths. In the Câk
shusha Manvantara he was the sage Sutapas and married to Prishnî. After
twelve thousand years of austerities he won Lord Vishnu’s promise that Vishnu
would be born as his son. In the next Manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu, Sutapas
and Prishnî were reborn as Kas ́yapa and Aditi, and Lord Vishnu was their son as
Vâmana-deva. Surasâ was one of Kas ́yapa’s wives in that lifetime and was
reborn with him in his next rebirth. Then in the next lifetime these three
Kas ́yapa, Aditi, and Surasâ—became Vasudeva and his two wives, Devakî and
Rohinî.

KAUTHUMI
Son of a brâhmin
A young brâhmin named Kauthumi, son of Hiranyanâbha, challenged the royal
priests of King Janaka in debate. But he lost his temper and killed one of them,
thus committing brahmahatyâ (murder of a brâhmin). He was cursed and
became a leper that very day. After much suffering he followed the advice of his
father and used a magical incantation to Sûrya, the sun god (an incantation
184 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



known as the shrâvya-smajñaka-sûkta). He was healed of his leprosy and
redeemed from his sin.
This story warrants notice, as it recommended neither Brâhmanical rituals
(pûjâ) nor devotion (bhakti) but the magical power of secret mantras. Such a
myth would appear to be recommending the special role of the teacher (guru)
and esoteric knowledge.

KETU
An inauspicious celestial
Ketu had two levels of appearance in Hindu mythology. Astronomically Ketu
was a comet, as well as the descending node (waning) of the moon. Ketu’s
mythological persona expanded from these associations. Ketu was one of the
thirty-three children of Kas ́yapa and Danu, so that he was technically a dânava
and really an asura (demon). But his descending nature marked his character, as
did his association with Râhu, the lunar eclipse (who tried to steal soma from
the gods and had his head cut off). Ketu became the demon who created meteors
and comets. He was visualized holding a sword and a lamp—a monster with a
dragon’s head.

KRISHNA
Ninth incarnation of Vishnu; the Absolute itself
The Krishna myth cycle has been integrated in such a way that most Hindus do
not know its real complexity. Some of its elements are very ancient, showing
that many myths have come together to form modern versions. First, there was
the Krishna myth of a divine king, possibly with tribal or even Dravidian roots.
This Krishna, whose name literally means “dark” or “black one,” may have ele
ments of a historical figure from the first millennium before the common era.
The Krishna of the Mahâbhârata, a warrior in most sections, but the incarnation
of Vishnu in two of the epic’s appendices (the Bhagavad Gîtâ and the Hari
vamsa), could be merged with the tribal Krishna into what scholars call the
Vâsudeva Krishna, son of Vasudeva, being both royal and divine. But without
doubt, the most complex Krishna was found in the Purânas—especially the Bhâ
gavata Purâna. Here we find Krishna as the divine baby and child, the amorous
cowherd, the slayer of demons, and the victor over all forms of evil. This Krishna
Gopâla must be the most popular deity in India. And certainly for many, the
mythic streams from the Epics and the Purâna are harmonious. Finally, one must

return to the Mahâbhârata for the aged Krishna, once again all too human, with
stories of weakness and finally death. The stories selected from this wealth of
materials could fit into all the mythic traditions of India, universalist or sectar
ian. The account given here will summarize the most widely accepted versions.
Krishna was born as the eighth son of Vasudeva and Devakî. Vasudeva and
Devakî in their previous births were Kas ́yâpa and his wife Aditi. Another wife of
Kas ́yâpa, Surâsa, was reborn as Rohinî, to fulfill the task of being the foster
mother of Balarâma, Krishna’s brother.
His parents’ complex stories are nested in Krishna’s birth narrative and
employ one of the arch-villains of Hindu mythology, Kamsa, Krishna’s uncle,
who tries repeatedly to kill him.
Krishna was born with four hands holding the signs of Vishnu (conch, dis
cus, club, and lotus). After instructing his father Vasudeva concerning past lives,
Krishna revealed what needed to happen in this one. He then changed to a baby
with more human characteristics. Vasudeva took Krishna and traded him with
the baby who had been born to Nandagopa and Yashodâ in the village of Ambâdi.
Vasudeva had to cross the Yamunâ River, but it changed its course to aid in his
mission. Once Vasudeva returned with the substitute baby, he reported the birth
to Kamsa. The evil uncle raced to the prison cell and attempted to kill the incar
nation of Mâyâdevî as a baby girl, but she rose into the sky and spoke a chilling
message: that the one who would kill Kamsa had already been born. Kamsa
began a massacre of boy babies, so Nandagopa took Yashodâ and Krishna as well
as Rohinî and Balarâma and moved to Gokula.
Krishna spent his childhood in Ambâdi (Gokula) amongst the Gopâlas (“cow
keepers”) and the Gopîs (“female cowherds”), whose main profession was look
ing after cows, and selling milk and curd.
The childhood of Krishna was full of merrymaking and danger. He was
attacked by many types of demons in the service of Kamsa: Pûtanâ, the nurse with
poisoned breasts, whom Krishna sucked dry and left her dead; Sakata disguised as
a cart, which Krishna kicked to pieces; Trinâvarta who was invisible in a whirl
wind, whom Krishna weighted down and choked to death; and an almost endless
assortment of demons, beasts, and snakes. Some of these he killed dramatically,
others he subdued and then converted, like Kâliya, the giant water serpent on
whose head he danced. He performed miracles such as lifting Mount Govardhana
on his finger to protect the Yâdavas, the local villagers, from Indra’s torrential rain,
sent by Indra in retaliation because Krishna had encouraged the villagers to stop
worshipping Indra. Thus Krishna earned one of his many names, Govinda, “one
who lifted the mountain.” When his foster mother sought to catch him as the but
ter thief—or, some versions said, for putting dirt into his mouth, others, for eating
sweets—he simply opened his mouth and showed her the entire universe.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 187



Râdha became his best female friend, though each of the Gopîs thought that
she was his favorite. Krishna was always accompanied by his brother Balarâma,
who had been brought to Gokula by the sage Garga. Their play (lîlâ) with the
Gopîs during this period became the subject of an extensive literature on devo
tion and love. On the surface it was highly erotic, including pranks like stealing
the clothes of the Gopîs and making them come before him and beg, and calling
all the women into the forest for lovemaking, even multiplying himself at least
on one occasion so that each of them could have their own Krishna. The Gopîs
were even called the 16,008 wives of Krishna. But good mythology, like good
theology, has many levels of meaning—and at the deepest level that kind of love
making has been seen as pointing to a devotional relationship that risks every
thing for a personal experience of Krishna’s presence and grace: loving, total,
dangerous, and so much more.
By way of balance, Krishna also lived as a student (brahmachâri) in the
âsrama of the sage Sândipani—following the orthoprax Brâhmanical stages of
life (as ́rama-varna-dharma). Ready to perform their divine mission, Krishna and
Balarâma traveled to Mathurâ for the fateful encounter with Kamsa. There they
killed Kamsa, and released Vasudeva and Devakî from prison.
Kamsa’s death was said in some accounts to have been necessary to deny
Râvana his most powerful ally for the Râma-Râvana war. However, unraveling
the nested myths in the Râma myth cycle is another problem; Krishna’s purpose
for incarnation did not end with his cosmic victory of evil, personified in Kamsa,
but was prolonged in a sagely way as chariot driver for Arjuna in the great
Bharata war. Krishna helped Draupadî, joint wife of Arjuna and his brothers,
when she was assaulted by Dushshâsana, son of Duryodhana, leader of the Kau
ravas. On the Kurukshetra battlefield Krishna advised Arjuna about his duty and
even manifested himself as the Supreme. After the Pandavas won the great war
and set up their rule, the Yâdava dynasty, to which Krishna belonged, declined
and was finally destroyed by internal strife. Krishna’s death was told from a
number of points of view. The most widely accepted is that the real reason for
his death was that his mission as an incarnation was over. So one day he was sit
ting on a branch in a tree. A hunter mistook the sole of his foot for a bird and
shot him with a poisoned arrow. (His foot was the only spot not protected by the
magical potion of Durvâsa.) So Krishna died and ascended to svarga (heaven) and
merged again into Vishnu.

KRITTIKÂS
Goddesses; the Pleiades, wives of the seven sages (sapta-rishis)
Six of the wives of the seven sages, known as the mahârishis, were suspected of
committing adultery with Agni and were cursed to become the Krittikâs, star
sisters of the Pleiades. Astrological symbolism resides in this myth, giving an
idea of what was observable at that time in the heavens. Mythologically there
was ambiguity about their becoming stars. Some versions implied that this fate
was a reward for their nursing the creation of S ́iva, as Subrahmanya, while other
versions made it a punishment. Also the paternity of Skanda as Subrahmanya,
the fierce warrior, was questioned, with some myths stating that Agni was his
father instead of S ́iva and the six Krittikâs were his mothers.

KSHÎRÂBDHI-MATHANAM
The myth of the Churning of the Milky Ocean
This is one of the richest Hindu myths. It is a creation myth and also a trickster
myth, and it is nested in the Vishnu myth cycle as an avatâra (incarnation)
myth. It has versions that are pan-Indian and versions that are sectarian (those
used to prove the supremacy and ultimacy of Vishnu). When it functions as an
origin myth, answering the question of how the gods (devas) became immortal,
this myth also becomes a trickster myth—how the devas trick the demons
(asuras) out of their share of the sacrifices and especially out of receiving the
drink of immortality (amrita or amritsa). There are many versions of this myth,
as well as many uses of it in other myths, both in the form of references to it and
in the form of reversals of its themes.
In the sixth manvantara (world cycle) of the current kalpa (eon), the devas
were losing in their battles with the asuras. One account said that the god Indra
had slighted a brâhmin sage named Durvâsa and from that day on the power of
the gods declined. So the devas went to Brahmâ, who immediately—as was usu
ally the case in the Vaishnava myth cycle—counseled them to go to Vishnu.
Vishnu told the gods to follow his instructions exactly. They would have to
work with the demons, but in the end Vishnu would enhance their glory. So the
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 189



devas convinced the asuras that they must work together in order to obtain the
drink of immortality. They would need to churn it up from the Milky Ocean
(kshîra-sâgara). First herbs were thrown in the clear waters. Mount Manthara
was used as a churning staff, and the giant snake Vâsuki became the churning
rope. The devas took Vâsuki’s tail, while the asuras grabbed his head with its
fiery breath. Vishnu became the support for the mountain as the turtle avatâra
(Kûrma) and simultaneously took an invisible form and pressed down on the
mountain from above. The gods and demons pulled back and forth with Vâsuki,
stirring the ocean and bringing all manner of things into being: Kâmadhenu (the
wish-granting cow), Vârunîdevî, Pârijâtam, the apsaras, Chandra-Soma (the
moon), venom (halâhala), which was absorbed by the serpents (nâgas), Dhan
vantari with the pot of amrita, and Mahâlakshmî. The avatâra Kûrma raised
Mount Mandara when it started to sink. The demons grabbed the pot of amrita
from the sage Dhanvantari and would have become immortal had they drunk it.
But the demons were tricked out of their share when Vishnu appeared as Môhinî
and mesmerized them with her feminine charm and beauty. She told the asuras
that she was lonely and looking for a mate. Môhinî said that they should close
their eyes and the one who opened them last would be the one she would marry.
But Môhinî went immediately to Devaloka (heaven) and gave the amrita to the
devas. And even though the asuras attacked, the devas were strengthened by the
divine drink and won dominion over the three worlds.

KUBERA
A dark spirit who became the wealthiest god (deva)
Kubera has been interpreted to be a deva and, as such, the god of wealth. There
were several versions of his parentage. In the Atharvaveda Kubera was chief of
the spirits of darkness and son of Vaishravana. In the Mahâbhârata Kubera was
son of the grandfather (prajâpati) Pulastya, by his wife Idavidâ, and brother of
Vis ́ravas. However, in the Purânas his lineage, born of Vis ́ravas by Ilibilâ,
became fixed and he was king of the Yakshas (the “marvelous” or “mysterious”
ones)—and thus an asura (demon). His half brother was Râvana, demon of
Râmâyana fame. Yet Kubera is accepted among the gods and even prayed to at
the end of all ritual sacrifices.
Kubera married Bhadrâ (auspicious) and their daughter was Mînâkshî (fish
eyed). As myths were conflated, Kubera acquired both celestial and terrestrial
domains. He was the lord of riches, especially those within the earth, which he
could move by his will from one place to another. He often brought gems and
190 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



precious metals near the surface during the rule of righteous kings and hid them
during times of wickedness. He was also regent of the north (a world protector,
Lokapâla). Kubera received his mace from the fragments of the sun that the
celestial architect, Vis ́vakarman, trimmed from the sun to reduce his brilliance,
in order to help the sun’s wife live with him. His celestial city was well known
for its wealth, located north of Himâlaya. He ruled the island kingdom of Lanka
before his half-brother Râvana drove him away, even stealing Kubera’s aerial
vehicle, called the Pushpakavimâna. Even though Kubera is preserved as god of
wealth by the continuing use of a prayer to him in Brâhmanical ritual, Ganes ́a
overshadows him in the hearts of the majority of Hindus.

KUBJÂ
An ugly widow
The myth of Kubjâ is embedded within that of Tilottamâ, an apsara. Kubjâ
either gained liberation from her performance of auspicious rituals, especially
the one known as the Mâgha bath, or was transformed into a beautiful woman
by the embrace of S ́rî Krishna. Kubjâ was the rebirth of the celestial damsel
called Tilottamâ, or Kubjâ might be seen as the incarnation of Tilottamâ.

KUCELA
A poor brâhmin
Kucela was a fellow student with Krishna of the sage Sândîpani. They were close
friends as students, but lost contact in the following years. Kucela could not pro
vide for his large family, and all were on the verge of starvation. One day his wife
sent Kucela to visit Krishna with only a small package of rice as a gift—their last
food. Krishna accepted the rice and ate a handful. Perhaps Krishna forgot to pro
vide a feast for Kucela as they became engrossed in their renewed friendship, and
perhaps Kucela forgot his mission to seek help for his family. (The various ver
sions are rich with different details.) But the visit came to an end, and Kucela
was almost home when he realized that Krishna had not given him anything to
take back to his family. However, when he reached the place where once his
miserable hut was, Kucela found a palace. Krishna had abundantly provided for
his every need. Thus, Kucela, the friend of Krishna, became known as Sudâman,
“the one upon whom [Krishna] bestowed abundantly.”

KUMBHAKARNA
An asura (demon)
Kumbhakarna appeared in the Râmâyana in a line of rebirths that started in
Brahmâ’s court in heaven (svarga). In that lifetime he had been Vijâya, one of a
pair of twin doorkeepers who were cursed for not properly performing their
duties. He was reborn as Hiranyakas ́ipu and killed by Vishnu in his Narasimha
incarnation (avatâra). Next he was reborn as Kumbhakarna, to be killed by
Vishnu in his Râma avatâra.
Kumbhakarna was a son of Vis ́ravas by his râkshasa (night-wandering
demon) wife Keshinî. He was a full brother of Râvana. The brothers practiced
such power austerities (tapas) that the gods became frightened. They had Saras
vatî (goddess of learning) dance on Kumbhakarna’s tongue when he asked
Brahmâ for a boon. Kumbhakarna was going to ask for annihilation of the devas
(nirdevatvam), but with Sarasvatî dancing on his tongue, he asked for sleep
(nidrâvatvam). So that was what Brahmâ gave him. Kumbhakarna slept for six
months and then was only awake for a day. When the war was going poorly for
Râvana, Kumbhakarna was awakened, readied for battle with two thousand pots
of liquor, and sent against Sugrîva, the great monkey warrior. Kumbhakarna was
able to defeat Sugrîva by pounding him into submission with a giant boulder,
and then carried him into Lanka as a prisoner. He returned to the battle and met
Râma in single combat. But after a great fight, Râma cut off his head.
Kumbhakarna’s advice to Râvana during various phases of the war showed
that he judged his brother’s actions as wrong and yet did his duty as a younger
brother. In Brâhmanical orthoprax morality Kumbhakarna had done his duty in
that birth. He was reborn as Dantavaktra, a Dânava king of Karûsha, to be killed
by Vishnu in his Krishna avatâra. Then he returned to Vaikuntha, the abode of
Vishnu.

Kuntî was the aunt of Shrî Krishna, mother of the five Pandavas and a sixth son
Karna, and wife of King Pandu. Kuntî was a heroine of the Mahâbhârata. As a
child Kuntî was given to a royal cousin, King Kuntibhoja, who was childless. She
was given responsibility over religious arrangements in his palace. That was
when she met and served the powerful brâhmin Durvâsa. In his gratitude for her
devotion, Durvâsa gave her a magical incantation that had the power to mani
fest any god upon whom she was thinking and allow her to have a child by him.
She could not contain her curiosity to see if it worked and chanted the mantra
192 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



focusing of the sun god, Sûrya. How gentle Sûrya was, assuring her that she
would not even lose her virginity by having a child with him. So they conceived
Karna, and only with the help of her stepmother was she able to hide her preg
nancy. When she gave birth to this exceedingly handsome baby, Karna, he was
immediately placed in a box and sent afloat down the river As ́vâ, on into the
Yamunâ, and then into the Gangâ. The box was pulled from the river by Adhi
ratha, charioteer of King Dhritarâshthra, and taken to his childless wife Râdhâ.
So Karna was brought up by these foster parents in the country of Anga.
Some accounts said that Kuntî chose her own husband in a svayamvara, wed
ding of her own choosing, but others more logically stated that she was married
to the pale old King Pandu, to strengthen military alliances. Pandu soon took a
second wife, Mâdrî. Versions differ about Pandu’s age and health and whether or
not he was cursed for killing a brâhmin who was making love with his wife in the
form of deer. According to that version, a death curse had been placed on him: if
he made love with his wives he would die. In both versions, the result was the
same: both wives were childless, and he tried to get his wives to have sons by
some noble person. It was then that Kuntî remembered her boon from Durvâsa.
With Pandu’s blessing, Kuntî used the mantra three more times for herself, hav
ing Dharmaputra (Yuddhishthira) by Dharma-deva, Bhîma by Vâyu-deva, and
Arjuna by Indra-deva. Pandu wanted his wife Mâdrî to have children as well, so
Kuntî gave her the last use of the fivefold boon. Mâdrî wisely focused on the
As ́vins and had twins by them. That winter in exile in the forest Pandu forgot
about the curse, made love with Mâdrî, and instantly died. Both wives would have
joined him on his funeral pyre (sati), but the priests insisted that one of them
must live to care for the little baby boys. So Kuntî lived to raise both sets of sons,
known as the five Pandavas, in the palace at Hastinâpura with her husband’s
brother, King Dhritarâshthra, his wives, and their hundred sons, the Kauravas.
Eventually this arrangement brought out too much rivalry between the
cousins, and Kuntî and her sons, the Pandavas, moved to the Lac palace at Vâranâ
vata. When it was set aflame in an attempt to kill all of them, they escaped
through a secret tunnel and went into hiding. Each time an attempt was made to
reconcile the brothers with their cousins more conflicts, deceits, and suffering
occurred. Through it all Kuntî tried to mediate between the Kauravas and the Pan
davas. After the great Bhârata war Kuntî helped all the others in their grief over the
enormous losses of so many of their kin. She then went with Dhritarâshthra and
his wife Gândhârî into the forest on the banks of the Gangâ. There they practiced
stern penances, taking food only once a month, until they all died in a forest fire.
Kuntî, joined by Mâdrî and Pandu, then entered Devaloka (heaven).

KÛRMA
Second incarnation of Vishnu as a tortoise
This is one of the richest myths in the Vishnu myth cycle. Its popularity makes
it pan-Indian and not just sectarian, even though many versions attempt to prove
the ultimacy of Vishnu and his supremacy over S ́iva. When it is seen as an ori
gin myth, answering the question of how the gods became immortal, this myth
also includes a trickster myth, which tells how the gods tricked the demons out
of their share of the sacrifices and especially out of receiving the drink of immor
tality (amrita, or amritsa). There are many versions of this myth, as well as
many uses of it in other myths, both in the form of references to it and of varia
tions upon its themes.
In the beginning the gods (devas) and the demons (asuras) decided that they
must work together in order to obtain the drink of immortality. They needed to
bring amrita into being from chaos, thus to bring it up from the primordial
ocean. They would have to make a churn large enough to stir the possibilities of
existence into being from the Milky Ocean. Vishnu incarnated as a turtle and
dove to the bottom of the sea. Upon his back rested the famous Mount Mandara,
which would be the churning stick. The serpent Vâsuki was used as the churn
ing rope, and the gods and demons pulled back and forth, stirring the ocean and
bringing all manner of things into being. Finally, the pot of amrita came to the
surface in the hands of the sage Dhanvantari. The asuras took the divine
ambrosia from him—and may have even been willing to share it. But the devas
had a promise from Vishnu that the asuras would not be allowed to have a share.
The demons were tricked out of their share of the drink of immortality by a
manifestation of Vishnu as Môhinî, a temptress of unusual beauty. Seductively,
Môhinî coaxed the asuras to allow her to divide it equally among them—but
only after they took a purificatory bath. Their trust was misplaced, as Môhinî
left with the amrita as soon as they went for their bath. And when the devas had
fortified themselves with the divine nectar, they were a match for the asuras.
The correct order (dharma) having been restored, Kûrma’s purpose for incarnat
ing had been accomplished, so he was able to merge back into Vishnu.

KURUKSHETRA
A place north of modern Delhi
Kurukshetra simply means “the field of the Kurus.” The Kurus or Kauravas
decended from Kuru, a king of the Lunar Dynasty. About eighty-five miles
north-northeast of Delhi, Kurukshetra has been an important pilgrimage site
(tîrtha) for at least twenty centuries. References in the Mahâbhârata to a fire

LAKSHMANA
Son of Sumitrâ and Das ́aratha
Lakshmana was the younger half-brother of Râma by the third and youngest wife
of King Das ́aratha of Ayodhyâ. But his affection for Râma was understood to
have been the result of his previous lifetime—as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu’s
serpent, the one who floated as his bed on the cosmic ocean, Ananta (also called
S ́esha). Lakshmana could even be counted as a one-eighth incarnation of Vishnu.
Lakshmana was the archetype of brotherly devotion, an example of pure human
love and devotion (bhakti).
Lakshmana married Ûrmilâ, with whom he had two sons. He left them
behind in Ayodhyâ and followed Râma and Sîtâ into their forest exile of fourteen
years. Lakshmana was heroic and loyal to Râma in every way. When a râkshasî
(female night-wandering demon) named Sûrpanakhâ found Râma very attractive
and wanted him as her husband, Râma rejected her. Furious she attacked the
brothers, and Râma ordered Lakshmana to disfigure her. Lakshmana cut off her
breasts and nose. Another account said that it was her nose and ears. Sûrpanakhâ
went straight to her three brothers, who swore they would avenge her mutila
tion. The giant râkshasas led an army of fourteen thousand against Râma and
Lakshmana and engaged them in a furious battle. However, the human brothers
killed every one of them. Then Sûrpanakhâ told her really big brother, Râvana,
and the war of revenge began with Sîtâ’s abduction to Râvana’s kingdom in
Lanka.
After helping Râma defeat Râvana and all his forces and returning to Ayod
hyâ, Lakshmana continued to help with Râma’s divine rule. However, the pur
pose for the incarnation had been completed, and Yama (the god of death, also
called Kâla, time) came disguised as a brâhmin. He demanded a private and
uninterrupted audience with Râma. Râma assigned Lakshmana the task of keep
ing all out on pain of banishment. Old, meddlesome Durvâsa arrived and ordered
Lakshmana to let him see the king immediately or he would curse Râma with
the worst of calamities. Knowing that he would have to be banished for break

ing what had been Râma’s royal command, Lakshmana burst in and forced Râma
to placate Durvâsa. Râma escaped Durvâsa’s curse, but Lakshmana was forced
into exile.
The ending of this incarnation had a stark version and a pleasant one. In one
account, Râma became depressed without his brother. Râma ended his life by
drowning in the Sarayû River at Gotâra and returned to Vishnu (Vaikuntha in
one account; Vishnupâda (“Vishnu’s feet”) in another; some see them as the
same). Lakshmana heard of Râma’s death and drowned himself at the same place
in the river. Another version stated that Lakshmana retired to the banks of the
Sarayû River and practiced penance there. The gods showered flowers on him
and transported him bodily to heaven—thus avoiding the problem of suicide.

LAKSHMÎ
Goddess, wife of Vishnu
Lakshmî’s multiple importance in Hindu mythology cannot be captured in a few
paragraphs. Three perspectives will demonstrate the breadth of her roles and the
changes in the ways in which she was perceived.
Linguistically and historically, lakshmî in the Rigveda was a word of femi
nine gender that quantified good fortune (the one of hundred thousands). Lakshmî
became personified in the later Vedas as the correspondences (bandhu) with the
priestly tradition found in the universe. In the S ́atapatha Brâhmana she and S ́rî
were the two wives of the celestial father, Âditya. However, Âditya as father
creator disappeared when âditya became a term for a group of gods, the âdityas
the sons of Aditya. Throughout the Vedic period Lakshmî floated from one father
to another: daughter of Prajâpati, Kshîrasâgarakanyakâ (“churning of the milky
ocean daughter”), mother of Kâma—usually with a lotus in one hand (padmâ). By
the time of the Epics Lakshmî had become a major goddess. She appeared in the
sage Nârada’s list of gods and goddesses whom he worshipped, and elsewhere she
had become associated with Vishnu as his wife, or as one of his wives.
From this point on, the myths about Lakshmî were imbedded in theological
perspectives. In goddess theology (S ́âkta) Lakshmî was Devî, the mother and
source of the universe, supreme energizing and creative energy of Vishnu. In
Hindu polytheism Lakshmî was one of the many interesting goddesses with a
myriad of stories about her many births and rebirths. In Vaishnava theology Lak
shmî was wife of Vishnu—the Supreme, from whom all exists. Shaiva theology
honored Lakshmî as Vishnu’s wife in much the same way as Hindu polytheism.
Thus, depending on the perspective, there were many variations of birth, or ori
gin, myths, purpose, or savior, myths, and so on.
196 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Lakshmî appears as Gajalakshmî, goddess with the elephants, giver of all that is good
and bountiful in life. (TRIP)



Lakshmî’s birth in the Devî Bhâgavata Purâna was from the Supreme
Being’s left side. Then she divided herself again into Lakshmî Devî and Râdhâ
Devî, each wedding different aspects of Vishnu to herself. Then in each incarna
tion (avatâra) of Vishnu, according to the Vishnu Purâna, Lakshmî also incar
nated: at the churning of the Milky Ocean as Padmâ, in the dwarf avatâra as
Kamalâ or Padmâ, in the Paras ́u-Râma incarnation as Dharanî, in the Râma
avatâra as Sîtâ, in the Krishna avatâra as Rukminî. In all other descents, she was
there as well. From this perspective Lakshmî’s story would be found nested in
the story of Vishnu’s incarnations.
There were stories from perspectives that suggest that Lakshmî was appro
priated by S ́aivas. These fragments could be explained from any perspective, but
they are worth mentioning to suggest her role in situations other than that of
being Vishnu’s wife. Lakshmî cursed Mahâvishnu to have his head fall off; she
stayed in the court of Kubera (god of wealth) and also in the court of Brahmâ, and
then as the goddess S ́rî, saying that she was only Lakshmî, not Sacî (a wife of
Indra), and that she had left Bali for Indra. The stories about Lakshmî courting
kings may have been responsible for a division of Mahâlakshmî (Great Lakshmî)
into two forms: a chaste and virtuous Vishnu-priyâ-Lakshmî and a flirtatious
Râjya-Lakshmî. But a curse was used to explain why she lived with or was the
wife of so many different gods.
As the goddess of wealth and plenitude, Lakshmî is worshipped in temples
and homes in many forms, such as Gajalakshmî (a river goddess) or Dhana
lakshmî (giver Lakshmî). Her images almost always hold a lotus (padmâ) in one
hand.

LANKA
A city; an island
In the Râmâyana the story is told that Brahmâ gave Lanka to Kubera, god of
wealth. Celestial architects Vis ́vakarman and Maya together designed this celes
tial city and built it of gold. Its first location was on the top of Mount Trikûta, a
peak of Mahâmeru (great Meru). However, in a fight between Vâyu, god of wind,
and Vâsuki, king of the Nâgas, the entire peak, including the celestial city, was
broken off and knocked into the sea, becoming Lanka.
Râvana defeated his half-brother Kubera and ruled Lanka for many years.
When Râvana abducted Sîtâ, it was to his island kingdom that he brought her.

LANKÂ-LAKSHMÎ
The doorkeeper at Râvana’s palace
The Kamba Râmâyana’s account of Vijâya-Lakshmî and the story of the Jâya
and Vijâya from the Bhâgavata Purâna are mirrored copies of each other. Lankâ
Lakshmî had been Vijâya-Lakshmî in her previous lifetime. As Vijâya-Lakshmî,
she had been a negligent doorkeeper at Brahmâ’s palace. So Brahmâ cursed her
to be reborn as the doorkeeper of Râvana. Brahmâ told her that she would be
released from the curse and would return to heaven by the touch of Vishnu.
Some accounts take the mystery out of the story by giving away the entire end
ing: Hanuman, a partial incarnation of Vishnu, was destined to fulfil the condi
tion of her release.
Thus, Hanuman arrived to Lanka and was barred entry by an enormous
female warrior, Lankâ-Lakshmî, who let out a ferocious roar. Hanuman knocked
her down with a single blow. Lankâ-Lakshmî politely asked his mission, learned
of Râma, went to him, worshipped him, was blessed by Râma, returned to Satya
loka (the place of truth, heaven), and resumed her duties with a better attitude.

LIKHITA
A sage
In the Mahâbhârata Likhita and S ́ankha were brothers, with their as ́ramas (her
mitages) next to each other on the banks of the Bâhudâ River. One day Likhita
was hungry and went over to his brother’s as ́rama and began eating his vegeta
bles. S ́ankha discovered the theft and took Likhita before the king. The king’s
law stated that a thief would be punished by cutting off the thief’s hands. So
King Sudyumna did just that. With blood flowing from each arm, Likhita stood
before S ́ankha. The older brâhmin congratulated his brother for accepting his
punishment and then told him to bathe in the Bâhudâ. Likhita did and his hands
began growing back. He ran to S ́ankha, who told him that this was accomplished
by the power of his (S ́ankha’s) austerities (tapas). Likhita questioned why his
brother could not have purified him without having his hands cut off. S ́ankha
answered that it was the duty (dharma) of the king to administer the law and
that King Sudyumna had become great by so doing.

age, also called satya yuga). She went to another town looking for better clients.
She noticed devotees celebrating a festival at the temple. When she inquired,
Lîlâvatî learned that it was the celebration of the birthday of Râdhâ Devî and
that anyone who observed the vow of devotional penance and fasting (vrata) that
day would be absolved of all their sins. Lîlâvatî joined in the temple worship for
the whole day. Shortly afterwards, she died of snake bite. Yama came to take her
soul to hell for all her sins as a prostitute. Vishnu’s helper also arrived in a char
iot pulled by celestial swans (hamsas) and took her to heaven because of her one
day of devotion.

LINGA, LINGAM
A symbol of S ́iva
There is scholarly agreement that there was worship of the male generative
organ in the Indus Valley civilization. Both archeological remains and explicit
references to “worshippers of the phallus” in the Rigveda support such an inter
pretation. However one interprets S ́iva’s origin—as from the Indus Valley, from
tribal religion, within the Aryan clans, or any combination of these—use of the
linga to represent S ́iva was indisputable in the Epics and Purânas. Three myths
will suffice: one of self-castration, another about an attempted curse, and then
one about the consequence of a curse.
In the S ́iva Purâna Brahmâ, Vishnu, and Rudra (S ́iva) were arguing over cre
ation. When Brahmâ and Vishnu told S ́iva that he was the lord of everything and
for him to create as he wished, S ́iva dove into the cosmic waters for more than
a thousand celestial years. Brahmâ and Vishnu decided not to wait for creation
any longer, so Vishnu gave Brahmâ enough energy (s ́akti) to bring everything
into being. Just when Brahmâ had finished his creation, S ́iva emerged from the
water and angrily destroyed everything by fire. The frightened Brahmâ wor
shipped S ́iva lavishly, whereupon the pleased S ́iva granted Brahmâ a boon.
Brahmâ asked that everything be restored. S ́iva restored Brahmâ’s creation, dis
covered that he had no use for all the creative energy he had stored up, and tore
off his linga. The discarded linga extended deeper into the cosmic waters than
Vishnu could dive and higher into the cosmos than Brahmâ could soar. So they
instituted worship of the linga with heart and mind focused upon S ́iva, because
all desires would be fulfilled by S ́iva.
In the Brahmânda Purâna the seven great sages (sapta-rishis), primordial
mahârishis (great sages) led by Bhrigu, were visited by S ́iva in the pine forest on
the slopes of Himâlaya. Despite all their asceticism and orthodox living they
were unable to recognize the god of gods, Mahâdeva himself. He was smeared

with ash, naked, his linga decorated with red and white chalk, howling and
dancing. He excited their wives, so the sages used all their ascetic powers (sid
dhis) to curse him—but to no avail. Their curses had been effective against all
the other gods: Brahmâ’s sacrifice was destroyed; Vishnu’s incarnations were
made miserable by Bhrigu’s curse; Indra was castrated by Gautama’s curse; the
Vasus were imprisoned as embryos; Nahusha was cursed to be a serpent; the
Milky Ocean was made undrinkable; Dharma-deva was cursed by Mândavya. So
again they tried, cursing S ́iva’s linga to fall off. Even then they failed. But S ́iva
chose to disappear, cutting off his own linga and leaving the world without any
light or energy. So the sages raced in panic to Brahmâ and learned that they had
been dealing with the lord of the universe. They learned from Brahmâ how to
propitiate him with an image of the linga as they worshipped and praised S ́iva.
Finally, S ́iva revealed himself to them and taught them the supreme yoga so that
they would be purified.
In the Padma Purâna the great sages wanted to know who was the supreme
lord and deserved their worship. Bhrigu was selected to test each of the Trimûrti,
the Hindu Triad. Bhrigu went to Kailâsa and demanded to see S ́iva. But Nandi,
S ́iva’s bull, rudely prevented him from going into S ́iva’s palace because S ́iva was
making love and was not to be disturbed by anyone. After many days of waiting,
Bhrigu cursed S ́iva: because he was so addicted to lovemaking, he would only be
worshipped as a linga and yoni (female generative symbol). Bhrigu further
declared that no twice-born (orthoprax Hindus of the upper three castes, but in
this story, seemingly just brâhmins) would worship S ́iva. Next Bhrigu traveled
to Brahmaloka and again was not welcomed. Brahmâ sat on his lotus flower full
of passion (rajas). So Bhrigu cursed him: Brahmâ would cease to be worshipped
by anyone. Finally, Bhrigu went to the northern shore of the Milky Ocean and
found Vishnu sleeping on his serpent, Ananta (eternity). When Vishnu did not
wake up immediately, Bhrigu became angry at his lack of courtesy and kicked
Vishnu. Îs ́vara awoke, saw Bhrigu, and welcomed him in the highest manner
expected by a brâhmin—even thanking him for kicking him with feet whose
dust caused good fortune. The proud brâhmin had finally found a god who was
worthy of worship by brâhmins. So he returned to the great sages and reported
that only Vishnu could be worshipped by the twice-born. Then he bragged about
his curse: thanks to him, in the future S ́iva would only be worshipped in a des
picable form—the linga.

Mâdrî was the second wife of King Pandu and was a mother of two of the five
Pandava brothers. When she was lent a magical incantation by Kuntî (the king’s
first wife) that would allow her to have a child by any deity she focused on,
Mâdrî concentrated upon the As ́vin twins, and twins were born to her, Nakula
and Sahadeva. When Pandu died shortly after his wives gave birth to the five
sons of gods, the Pandavas, Mâdrî joined him on his funeral pyre (sati).

MAGIC, BLESSINGS, CURSINGS
Many myths mention the use of magic directly. The myth of Bala, an asura
(demon), mentioned that he knew and taught ninety-six kinds of magic to trou
ble the devas (divinities). Hanuman was said to practice the eight superhuman
powers (ashtha siddhis). The asuras had a life-restoring magic (mritansañjîvanî)
that they had been using in their battles against the devas. It was this magic that
necessitated giving the devas amrita, a potion that bestowed immortality, which
was churned up from the Milky Ocean. S ́îlavatî was a wife who, by practice of
austerities (tapas), was able to cast a spell that prevented the sun from rising.
Many terms are used in the myths for those who practice this art: for exam
ple, mâyâvî and tapasvinî (magician). The logic of ritual and private magic is dis
cussed in chapter 1, “Renunciation, Sacrifice, and Magic.”

One of the two Epics; a scripture

verses, making it arguably the largest such poem in existence. It has tradition
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 203



ally been said to have been dictated by
the sage Vyâsa to his divine scribe,
Ganes ́a, who wrote it all down using
his single tusk as the stylus. It is cur
rently divided into eighteen parts,
with two important appendices: the
Harivamsha and the Bhagavad Gîtâ.
Although the epic may originally
have been drawn from bardic material
about warrior heroes, it was appropri
ated by an orthoprax Brâhmanical tra
dition that was eventually dominated
by the Bhârgava priestly lineage. Even
so, varied perspectives survive within
its caste framework (varna-as ́rama
dharma). Although nested storytelling predominates, a simple account can be
given of the basic events.
Two sons, Dhritarâshthra and Pandu, were born to King Vicitarvîrya. Dhri
tarâshthra was the elder, but because he was born blind, he was disqualified to
succeed Vicitarvîrya. So Pandu became king and had five sons, the Pandavas. But
shortly after their mysterious birth, he died. So Dhritarâshthra came to the
throne, which set up a problem of who would succeed him as king: his eldest son
Duryodhana or Pandu’s eldest son Yudhishthira. His one hundred sons and the
five Pandavas were raised, educated, and trained in the martial arts together.
Duryodhana claimed succession and forced the Pandavas and their joint wife
Draupadî into exile. But when Duryodhana took the throne, the Pandavas chal
lenged his right. So to avoid war Dhritarâshthra divided the kingdom. But Yud
hishthira lost their half in a gambling match, Draupadî was humiliated as
Duryodhana’s son claimed even her clothes, and the Pandavas were forced into
a twelve-year exile, plus a year of living incognito. The twelve years of forest
adventures nested stories within stories, followed by more adventures in the
year living incognito.
The Pandavas returned to claim their half of the kingdom in the fourteenth
year, but all this privation was for naught. Duryodhana would not honor the
agreement to return their kingdom. The great eighteen-day war began. Just
before combat was actually joined comes the episode recounted in the Bhagavad
Gîtâ: Arjuna lamented fighting a war against so many of his friends and kin, and
Krishna, his charioteer, answered that he must do his duty (dharma) and fight,
but that he could avoid sin by renouncing the fruits of his actions (thus engag
ing in nishkâma karma—desireless action).

Battle scenes from the great or Mahâbhârata war
(TRIP)



The Pandavas actually did win the war, but the emotional toll was so great
that Yudhishthira abdicated and left the kingdom to a young relative. He and his
brothers, their wife, Draupadî, and a dog set out for heaven, which was reached
by going north into the Himâlayas. All died along the way, except Yudhishthira
and his dog. When they finally reached heaven, the dog was refused entrance,
and Yudhishthira would not go into heaven without him. The problem was
solved when it was revealed that the dog was really Dharma-deva. Yudhishthira
was shocked to find Duryodhana already in heaven and, worse, that he himself
would have to be reborn to another lifetime on earth because of his attachments
and lack of renunciation.

because of this marriage. They moved to Pâtâla (the netherworld) before the

attempting to prevent the theft, Rambha was killed. Mahishî joined her hus

became the king of the asuras. Nobody could defeat Mahisha, as the son was
called—because of his father’s boon and an extension in the myth of karma
from father to son.
Mahisha was intoxicated with pride and even forced the gods to worship
him. Finally, they were led by Indra to ask a solution from Brahmâ, Vishnu, and
S ́iva. They decided upon war. A terrible battle occurred, but Mahisha just could
not be killed. The gods had to rest. Then, after several centuries had passed, they
gathered together and realized that Mahisha could not be killed by a male—and
that would include the Trimûrti (Brahmâ, Vishnu, and S ́iva). Mahisha could only
be defeated by a woman. Most accounts credited the gods with combining all
their powers to create a single being of light, a devî (goddess) of celestial beauty
with eighteen arms named Durgâ. She rode her lion to the entrance way into
heaven (Devaloka) and proclaimed that she would become the wife of anyone
who could defeat her in armed combat. Mahisha fell in love and was determined
to have her. He sent his seconds, then his army, and lastly himself. Finally, he
changed into his ferocious form of the buffalo demon but Durgâ cut off his head
with a discus (Vishnu cakra). Thus Mahishâsura was killed by Durgâ, and peace
and order were restored to the three realms.
In one major variant of the story, Kâlî sprang from Durgâ’s forehead, per
sonifying her anger, so that it would be Kâlî who killed Mahisha. And when the
world again was threatened by evil, by the demons S ́umbha and Nis ́umbha,
Durgâ’s avenging energy, Kâlî, destroyed them.

MAINÂKA
A mountain in the Harivamsa
There was a time when the mountains could fly. When they came to earth, they
caused injury and suffering. Humans prayed to Indra, and he cut off the moun
tains’ wings.
The mythic tradition used Mainâka in a variety of ways without much
regard to an actual location. Mainâka was the son of Himâlaya and was rescued
by his friend Vâyu, the wind god. Mainâka lived according to one account in the
ocean. Thereby Mainâka helped Hanuman, the great monkey god and servant of
Râma, cross the ocean on his way to Lanka to save Sîtâ. In another account

Mainâka was the mountain on which King Bhagîratha practiced the austerities
(tapas) that convinced S ́iva to bring the Gangâ to earth.

MAITRA-VARUNA
A sage with the patronym from Mitra and Varuna
This version of an episode involving King Nimi and the sage Vasishtha was
given in the Devî Bhâgavata. Nimi and Vasishtha had cursed each other, and the
result for Vasishtha was that he was alive but had no body. Vasishtha went to
Brahmâ for advice and was told to merge with the brilliance of Mitra-Varuna (the
composite sun deity). So Vasishtha went to Mitra-Varuna’s as ́rama (hermitage)
and merged with that brilliance. When the apsara (celestial damsel) Urvas ́î came
to the as ́rama, she excited Mitra-Varuna, whose seed was collected in a jar, and
two sages were born when the seed ripened—the great sages, Agastya and
Vasishtha.

MAITREYÎ
A woman sage
Maitreyî was mentioned in the Vedas and Purânas as one of the wisest and most
virtuous of women. Maitreyî was married to the great philosopher-sage
Yâjñavalkya. She was noted as being especially learned in the scriptures. In one
of the Upanishads Maitreyî engaged her husband in one of Hindu philosophy’s
great dialogues: about happiness as the most important experience in life.

MÂLINÎ
A Brahmin woman
This story has interesting implications about karma and rebirth. A brâhmin
woman was mentioned in the Skanda Purâna for her bad character and equally
bad deeds. Consequently, she was reborn as a dog. But during that lifetime she
was able to observe a vow of purification (S ́ukladvâdashi vrata) and was reborn
next as an apsara (celestial damsel)—the famed Urvas ́î. It was Urvas ́î who was
attracted to Arjuna during his time as a dance instructor. It was also Urvas ́î who
was cursed by Mitra and Varuna for exciting them.

MANDAKARNI (ALSO CALLED SATAKARNI)
A sage
Mandakarni did austerities (tapas) in a pond for ten thousand years. Indra
became fearful that Mandakarni’s tapas would be used to gain a boon that would
upset the order of heaven, so he sent five celestial maidens (apsaras) to distract
him. The five apsaras did distract Mandakarni. He built a palace near the pond
and lived with the maidens for many years. The palace became famous for music
and dance. Even Râma and Lakshmana visited Pañcâpsaras Palace (five celes
tials palace) during their exile in the forest. Mandakarni had no tapas left to
threaten Indra any more.

Wife of Râvana, king of asuras (demons)
In her previous birth, Mandodarî had been a celestial damsel (apsara) named
Madhurâ. Madhurâ went to Kailâsa to worship S ́iva, having observed a special
vow, the Somavâra vrata. When Madhurâ reached Kailâsa, Pârvatî, S ́iva’s wife,
was not there. Madhurâ worshipped and praised S ́iva. But they were attracted to
each other and made love. When Pârvatî returned to Kailâsa, she saw Madhurâ’s
breast smeared with the ash from S ́iva’s body. Pârvatî went into a great fury and
cursed Madhurâ to live as a frog for twelve years. S ́iva was grief-struck. He con
soled Madhurâ that after twelve years she would become a very beautiful woman
and would be married to a great king. Madhurâ became a frog in a well.

MANTRA
Sacred chant
During the Vedic period priests intoned verses, some spontaneous but most care
fully crafted according to the strict rules that made Sanskrit so precise and diffi

sure that no error was made in pronunciation, grammar, phrasing, accent, pitch,
and so on. Their use in Vedic religion is discussed in chapter 1, “The Vedic or

MANU, MANUS
The first man of each age; a creator
In the Rigveda there were references to Father Manu, implying that he was
either a creator or a progenitor of the human race. In the Satapatha Brâhmana
Manu was known as the first human, father of the race, first to kindle the sacri
ficial fire, and creator of the social order. There was also a story of Manu’s
instruction by a fish on how to build a boat. The fish then helped Manu survive
a great flood. When he was safe, Manu gave thanks, and a woman, Idâ (or Ilâ),
was created. With her as mother Manu produced the human race.
The Epics traced all royal lineages to Manu. One of his sons, Vikukshi,
founded the solar race of kings at Ayodhyâ. Purûravas, son of Manu’s daughter
Idâ, founded the lunar race of kings at Pratisthana.
In the later Purânas there arose multiple Manus, a Manu, or first man, for
each Manvantara. Manvantaras are approximately three hundred million years
each, and the present one is the seventh Manvantara. The current Manu is Manu
Vaivasvata. The six previous Manus were Svayambhuva, Svarocisa, Auttami,
Tamasa, Raivata, and Cakshusa. There will be seven more—Savarni, Daksasa
varni, Brahmasavarni, Dharmasavarni, Rudrasavarni, Raucya or Devasavarni,
and Bhautya or Indrasavarni.
See also Manvantara
MANVANTARA
Manu-antara (age of Manu)
There are many different calculations about just how long a manvantara is—but
all agree that it is in the millions of human years. A smaller figure sets the num
ber of years at only 4,320,000, while a larger calculation came to 306,720,000
human years. Each day in the life of Brahmâ, or kalpa, consists of a thousand
fourfold Yugas (caturyugas or mahâyugas). Each manvantara consists of sev
enty-one fourfold Yugas (caturyugas), or 306,720,000 human years. There are
fourteen manvantaras or “ages of Manu.” For more details and calculations
based on the Vishnu Purâna, see the discussion in chapter 2.

MARÎCI
A Marut; a Prajâpati; a mahârishi
Brahmâ created Marîci, whose life remains clouded in some mystery. His great
ness cannot be doubted, but some say that he was a Marut (one of a group of gods
associated with Indra, thus gods of storms and battle). Others that he was a Pra
jâpati (progenitor or grandfather), or even one of the seven mahârishis (sapta
210 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



rishis), who were also the seven cosmic principles. In the Brahmânda Purâna his
wife was Anasûyâ (without spite). According to the Bhâgavata Purâna Marîci
(light) and Ûrnâ married and had six sons so powerful that they rivaled the cre
ator. One day when they saw Brahmâ, they mocked him, saying that he was a
father who had married his own daughter (Sarasvatî). Brahmâ cursed them to be
born as demons. So these six had rebirths in two important incarnations of
Vishnu as sons of demons—of Kâlanemi and then of Hiranyakas ́ipu—and one as
humans, as sons of Vasudeva and Devakî.
In the Mahâbhârata Kas ́yâpa-Prajâpati was only the son of Marîci, who was
one of the six mind-born sons (mânasâ-putras) of Brâhma. The Vâlmîki
Râmâyana added Kas ́yâpa as the seventh and youngest sons of Brâhma and thus
a brother of Marîci.

MÂRKANDEYA
A sage in the Bhâgavata Purâna
Mârkandeya had a miraculous birth and would never grow older than sixteen
years old. His father was the sage Mrikandu, whose worship pleased S ́iva.
Appearing with a boon, S ́iva asked Mrikandu whether he wanted a son who was

of death. (TRIP)



brilliant but short-lived or dull with a long life. Mrikandu chose the brilliant
son. Mârkandeya surpassed all his expectations in his knowledge of the Vedas
and S ́âstras, but the years passed all too quickly. When Mârkandeya learned that
he would soon die, he began practicing severe austerities (tapas). When Yama’s
helpers came for Mârkandeya, they could not approach him because of the great
heat from his tapas. So Yama came and threw his noose, which encircled both
Mârkandeya and his idol of S ́iva. S ́iva angrily arose from the idol and killed
Yama to save Mârkandeya, his devotee.
Mârkandeya practiced severe austerities through the first six manvantaras.
Then in the seventh manvantara Indra tried everything to stop his devotions but
could not. The Purânas state that Mârkandeya is still alive, sixteen years of age,
and a great devotee (bhakta).

MARUTS
Celestial gods
The Maruts were said to be sons of Rudra, sons or brothers of Indra, sons of the
ocean, and later sons of Kas ́yâpa-prajâpati (a progenitor). In the Rigveda they
were associated with Indra, god of war, and Vâyu, god of wind. Perhaps they were
storm gods; certainly they helped in the fight against the ancient monster, Vri
tra. They seemed to know the art of chanting, as they could intone appropriate
Vedic verses. Later their numbers increased from 27 to 180.

MATSYA
Fish incarnation of Vishnu
There are many versions of the myth of Matsya in the Purânas, with many
interesting paradoxes and twists in the story line. Even the names of principle
characters change. But the essentials of the myth speak of an avatâra of Vishnu
coming down to earth at the end of an age in order to save the world from spiri
tual darkness. Vishnu had to save both the first human being, the sage
Satyavrata (who was to become the Manu, the first human, of the next or sev
enth manvantara) and save the Vedas.
So Vishnu incarnated as a tiny fish, and Satyavrata found him. When this
tiny creature spoke to him, expressing its fear of being in the pond, the sage took
him home in a water jar (kamandalu). The fish kept growing, so that Satyavrata
had to move it to larger and larger bodies of water until he finally placed it in the
ocean. Then he recognized the fish as Vishnu, lord of the universe. At that point
212 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Matsya told Satyavrata of the imminent end of the age with its resulting disso
lution (pralaya), and told him to prepare by saving animals and plants.
Satyavrata must also save the seven sages (sapta-rishis). He gathered everything
into a boat. When the flood began, Matsya appeared and threw them a rope,
which, in some versions, was said to be the great serpent Ananta.
While pulling the boat, Matsya instructed the future Manu and the Rishis in
the wisdom of the Vedas. This involved rescuing the Vedas, which had fallen
from the mouth of Brahmâ when he fell asleep at the beginning of the involution.
The great demon Hayagrîva had been waiting for his chance to steal the
Vedas for the demons (asuras), and thus the entire next age would have been
without the scriptures. Matsya defeated Hayagrîva and saved the Vedas for the
world, as each incarnation of Vishnu has always done.
The details of this myth vary slightly in different Purânas. In one, the sev
enth Manu, Vaivasvata, was the hero saved from the deluge of destruction at the
end of a cosmic cycle (a day of Brahmâ). Vishnu came as a small fish, which
Vaivasvata Manu found and saved, only to be responsible for moving it to larger
bodies of water as it grew. Finally only the ocean could hold Matsya. Then Manu
realized that this marvelous fish must be Vishnu, lord of the universe, whom he
worshipped. Matsya warned Manu of the flood and had him tie a ship to the
fish’s great horn. Thereby the ship was protected from the great storms until the
flood subsided.
In the Bhâgavata Purâna the demon Hayagrîva stole the Vedas as Brahmâ
ended the age and began his sleep. It was Vishnu as Matsya who saved the Vedas,
the sage Satyavrata, the seven rishis, and a boatload of animals and seeds for
plants, for the beginning of the next age. During the deluge of destruction (the
night of Brahmâ), Vishnu as Matsya instructed Satyavrata and the sapta-rishis in
the highest wisdom so that it would not be lost in the coming kalpa.

MAYA

MÂYÂ
A concept; the creative power of god
There is no concept in Hindu religion, philosophy, and mythology that, when
oversimplified, has led to more misunderstanding. The phrase “it is all illusion,
mâyâ” reflects this kind of usage. In fact the concept of mâyâ is complex, and
its meaning depends on the context; it is central to understanding Hindu
mythology. The concept of mâyâ provides the supporting structure both for the
magical effectiveness of the austerities and powers of Hindu mythology and for
a fundamental rejection of any worldview that involved taking such illusions
seriously. Other details about this contradictory usage of the concept of mâyâ
are found in the last two sections of chapter 1.
Linguistically, mâyâ comes from the verbal root ma—“to measure,” “to
mete out,” and by extension “to create” or “to construct.” Mâyâ implied a
power or a process of creation and the results of that process. Thus, in the
Rigveda Varuna used mâyâ to construct the earth and give it order (rita), and
Indra used mâyâ to conquer Vritra, the monster who prevented the rains. By the
time of the Upanishads, mâyâ was beginning to acquire at least five contexts of
meaning with many possibilities for overlapping—ritual, metaphysical, episte
mological, mythological, and magical. All agreed that mâyâ had to do with the
enigmatic qualities of life and the consciousness of life. Metaphysically and epis
temologically, mâyâ pointed to the process of mental creation and its corre
spondence to material creation. It entailed how we know, what we know, who
knows—and so much more. This theoretical usage of mâyâ would allow for a
contradiction or rejection of the practical usages of mâyâ—roughly correspon
ding to ritual, mythological, and magical approaches.
As discussed in chapter 1, the practical understanding of mâyâ (and s ́haktî)
as power rested on a “science” of observation and experimentation that supported
their application in ritual and ascetic practices. Orthoprax priests had concluded
that rituals worked when done precisely, as did incantations of mantras as
prayers of praise or formulas of magical control. Further, this understanding of
mâyâ as control of the mysteries of life concluded that austerities (tapas) led to
the power to control nature, including the gods, or to acquire any object of desire,
including heaven (svarga) or immortality. The mythological view of mâyâ is the
most practical one: that there are practices (rituals, austerities, devotion, or a
combination of these) that give mortals some control over the results of their
action (connecting with karma) and hope for the future. Many, many myths men
tion the use of magic directly, and many terms are used in the myths for this art:
for example, mâyâvî or tapasvinî (magician) and indrajala (magic or illusionism).
See the general discussion of these concepts in the last section of chapter 1,
“Renunciation, Sacrifice, and Magic” and “Mâyâ as Illusion.”

MITRA
One of the twelve âdityas; a sun god
In the Rigveda Mitra’s name was often associated with Varuna. One chapter
(Sukta) in the Rigveda said that if Mitra and Varuna were prayed to, the result
would be an abundance of rain. Mitra was also glorified as the god of night and
as ruling the earth and sky, together with Varuna.
In the Purânas Mitra was a son of Kas ́yâpa-prajâpati (a progenitor) and
Âditya. By the time of the Vishnu Purâna, there were twelve âdityas. The other
eleven were Vishnu, Sakra, Aryamâ, Dhâtâ, Tvashta, Purusha, Vivasvân, Savita,
Varuna, Bhaga, and Amsa.

MÔHINÎ
The feminine form of Vishnu
Môhinî appeared at the churning of the Milky Ocean, again for the birth of a
river and a divine monkey, and then for the incarnation of a sage.
In order to prevent the asuras (demons) from obtaining their share of the
divine nectar of immortality (amrita) that was produced from the churning of
the Milky Ocean, Vishnu transformed into a beautiful women, Môhinî. The
asuras, led by Jambha, were beguiled by her charm, surrendered the pot of amrita
they had taken from the sage Dhanvantari to Môhinî to divide equally among
them, and went to bathe at her request. Thus, by the double deception of shape
shifting and untruth, Vishnu saved the amrita for the devas (gods).
S ́iva heard about this gender transformation and wanted to see this form of
Vishnu. So S ́iva persuaded Vishnu to appear again as Môhinî. Upon seeing her
great beauty, S ́iva became excited and made love to Môhinî. The sweat that was
produced during their love play fell down and turned into a river called Gandakî,
according to the Skanda Purâna.
Hanuman was also born from an encounter between S ́iva and the feminine
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 215



form of Vishnu as Môhinî. The semen of S ́iva was deposited in the womb of
Anjanâ by the seven Rishis (sapta-rishis), according to the S ́iva Purâna.
There is a recent myth associated with the union of S ́iva and Môhinî that
claims that Swami Ayyappa, a very popular deity in South India, was another off
spring of their union.

Murukan is the most widely worshipped of the gods in much of South India,

NACIKETAS, NÂCIKETA
A young boy
Naciketas was born to the sage Vâjas ́ravas (also known as Âruni). Naciketas’s
dialogue with Yama (death) was made famous in the Katha Upanishad.
Vâjas ́ravas believed that he would gain heaven (svarga) by giving cattle as
charity (or perhaps to the gods in sacrifice). The young Naciketas noticed that
the cows were old and barren, so he doubted the efficacy of his father’s offerings.
Naciketas knew that his father had promised to give away everything, so he
asked if his father would also give him away, and to whom. Vâjas ́ravas ignored
his son, but his repeated question brought out an angry remark: that Naciketas
would be given to Yama, the god of death. Naciketas took his father’s words seri
ously and went to Yamaloka to see Yama.
When Naciketas reached the palace of Yama, the god was not there. Nacike
tas had to wait there for three days and nights without any food or drink. On the
fourth day Yama came and was surprised to see the young Naciketas waiting for
him. Yama, in one version, had offended a brâhmin by not giving him proper
hospitality, so Yama offered Naciketas three boons (perhaps for each of the days
he waited without food or drink). In another version it was Naciketas’s own
words and understanding that pleased Death and earned the boons.
Naciketas used the three boons wisely. He asked that his father should not
be angry when he returned and would recognize him, that Yama would teach
216 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



him the art of Agnividya (“knowledge of fire”—but this could mean far more
than sacrificial rituals, it could have meant the secret of “inner fire”), and that
Yama would tell him what was eternal after death. Yama tried to persuade
Naciketas to accept only the first two boons granted. But when this failed, Yama
promised riches or whatever the boy wanted—but Yama would not grant the
third boon. Naciketas, however, was persistent and replied that Yama could
keep the riches; all he wanted was to learn about the eternal. Yama finally agreed
to tell Naciketas about that which is eternal—even after the death of the physi
cal body.
Naciketas returned home a great sage.

NÂGA, NÂGAS
A class of serpents
The Nâgas were the race of serpents or snakes who were born from Kas ́yâpa-pra
jâpati (a progenitor) by his wife Kadrû. Many had divine powers and were neutral
as far as their relationship with the gods was concerned. It was their great power
that made them threatening to humans.
When Bala-Râma, brother of Krishna, died, his spirit left his body through
his mouth as a white serpent and was welcomed into the netherworld by the
Nâga kingdom. Prince Candrângada was rescued by the Nâga king Takshâka and
lived in his kingdom for a while, even marrying the Nâga princess Ulûpî.
Nevertheless, Nâgas were also dangerous, having absorbed the venom
(halâhala) that was churned up from the Milky Ocean. Garuda, the sun eagle,
was their natural enemy, eating them as his preferred food. Vâsuki, Kâliya, and
Takshâka were among the most famous Nâgas.
In some lists Nâgas were classified as minor gods or devas.

NAHUSHA
A king
Even before his birth, Nahusha has been proclaimed as the one to kill the demon
(asura) that attempted to violate Pârvatî’s “wish-born” daughter, As ́okasundarî.
In the Epics and Purânas Pârvatî had been taken to the most beautiful gar
den in heaven by S ́iva in the midst of their love play (lîlâ). Pârvatî saw the kalpa
tree (Kalpa vriksha), the wish-fulfilling tree, and wished As ́okasundarî into
being. As ́okasundarî grew into a beauty who became the object of desire of an
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 217



asura named Hunda. He attempted to molest her but was cursed to be killed by
As ́okasundarî’s mortal husband-to-be, the yet-unborn Nahusha. Hunda then
attempted to kill Nahusha in his mother’s womb.
There was a birth in the Tantras that can be sometimes nested within the
story of Nahusha. It involved a blessing from the sage Dattâtreya, who was
served by King Âyus for a hundred years in order to obtain a son—Nahusha. King
Âyus was given a magical fruit for his wife after he gave the sage meat and liquor
in a skull. Queen Indumatî ate the fruit, and Nahusha was born. Hunda stole the
baby boy, planning to eat him and so obtain the power of the fruit, but through
a series of mistakes missed getting to eat the baby. Instead Nahusha was raised
by the sage Vasishtha. Good old sage Nârada showed up to tell the grieving par
ents that their baby was fine and would return at the right time. Hunda tried to
kill Nahusha many times, but all his attempts failed. Hunda was finally killed
by Nahusha. Then, Nahusha married As ́okasundarî and to them was born the
famous Yayâti, a future emperor. They also had a hundred beautiful daughters.
An additional Purânic story illustrated an old theme: that too much power
and success could spell trouble. The great King Nahusha was needed in heaven
to rule in Indra’s absence. But Nahusha desired Indra’s wife Indrânî and was
cursed by the sage Agastya for his sin. Nahusha became a python in the very for
est of the exiled Pandavas. Nahusha was released from the curse once he met
them. Then he returned to Indra’s heaven.
Nahusha’s great-grandsons became the Yâdava dynasty, so important in the
Mahâbhârata.

NAKULA
The fourth of the Pandava brothers of Mahâbhârata fame
Nakula and his brother Sahadeva were born to King Pandu and his wife Mâdrî.
However, their birth was not normal—a curse prevented Pandu from touching
his wives on pain of death, and a magical incantation had allowed their mother
to have twins by the As ́vins (the twin divine physicians). Some texts made them
incarnations of the twin gods. (For more details about their birth see entry on
Kuntî.)
Nakula, like Arjuna, was a great archer. To Nakula and Draupadî, the Pan
davas joint wife, was born a son named Satânîka. Nakula had another son named
Niramitra born to his second wife, Karenumatî. Karenumatî was the daughter of
the king of Chedi. During a year of incognito stay in the kingdom of Virata,
Nakula assumed the name Granthika and looked after the royal horses along
with his brother Sahadeva.
218 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Nakula defeated many great kings in the Mahâbhârata war. He even
defeated his teacher, Dronacharya, but did not kill him, as he was a brâhmin. A
few years after the Kurukshetra battle, the five Pandavas retired to the forest
(their mahâprasthâna, great pillar). Nakula and Sahadeva died on the long jour
ney that the brothers undertook to heaven, but they were able to go directly,
returning in some versions to their original form as the As ́vin twins.

NALA
The king of Nishâda
King Nala of Nishâda, son of Virasena, and Damayantî were known as great
lovers in the Purânic literature. They were foresters in their previous births
with the same name, Âhuka and Âhukâ. They were granted a boon by S ́iva that
they would be born in royal families in their following birth. According to S ́iva
Purâna, S ́iva helped in their romance as the swan who flew from Nala to tell
Damayantî about him.

NALAKUBERA
One of the two sons of Kubera
Nalakubera had a god, Kubera (god of wealth), as his father and his grandson was
Vis ́ravas—in his dark, or demonic, lineage. In a lineage that seemed to recognize
more of Kubera’s divinity, Nalakubera’s grandfather (prajâpati) was Pulastya (a
progenitor).
The demon Râvana was Nalakubera’s uncle. Ravâna, the constant woman
izer, raped Rambhâ, to whom Nalakubera was engaged. Rambhâ pleaded with
Râvana that he was an uncle to her and should not do such an evil thing. But
Râvana did anyway. Nalakubera was enraged and cursed Râvana: that his head
would be split into pieces if he ever touched a woman again without her consent.
This was the reason that Ravâna could not touch Sîtâ when he abducted her to
get even with Râma.
Manigriva was the brother of Nalakubera. One day the two brothers were
playing with celestial damsels (apsaras) in a pond, when the cranky old sage
Nârada came by. When the damsels saw him, they put on their clothes and paid
their respects to him. Unfortunately, Nalakubera and Manigriva could not see
Nârada, and they continued playing in the buff. Nârada cursed them for their
indecent behavior: they would become two trees in their next birth. They could
be released from the curse by S ́rî Krishna.

ers received back their human forms.

NANDI
Bull of S ́iva
Nandi was both a divine bull and a
human manifestation of S ́iva. One
account stated that Kandikeshvara
(the tawny-colored dwarf), or Adhi
kâra-Nandin, had lived a good and
long life that was coming to an end.
He prayed to S ́iva for a longer life, and
S ́iva not only granted his request but
placed Nandi, as he came to be called,
over a portion of his dwarfs (ganas).
Adhikâra-Nandin was Nandi in his
human form with the physical appear
ance of S ́iva and stands at the entrance
to many South Indian temples as a
door guardian. There are several sepa
rate accounts of his birth. One had
Adhikâra-Nandin springing from the
right side of Vishnu as a gift to the brâhmin Sâlankâyana, whose austerities
brought a son who looked exactly like S ́iva. This was said to be Adhikâra
Nandin’s forty-ninth rebirth. Another version stated that the rishi (sage) Nandi
earned a boon from S ́iva by his great austerities and it was his wish to become
head of S ́iva’s ganas.
Nandi the eternal bull had a number of roles—all in relation to Lord S ́iva.
Nandi was S ́iva’s vehicle (vahana), his chamberlain, the chief of his attendants
(ganas, dwarves), the guardian of all the four-legged creatures. The Vâyu
Purâna said that Nandi was the son of Kas ́yâpa-Prajâpati and Surabhî. He mar
ried Suyashâ, daughter of the Maruts (who have become ganas in S ́aivite
mythology).
220 Handbook of Hindu Mythology
Nandi is S ́iva’s vâhana, his vehicle or mount.

The bull Nandi is prominent at all S ́aiva temples, usually facing the inner
shrine (garbha griha). He should be white as milk in color.

NARA
A sage
Nara was one of the four sons of the god (deva) Dharma. Dharma-deva had been
born from the breast of Brahmâ. Dharma-deva married the ten daughters of Dak
sha. His four sons were Nara, Nârâyana, Hari, and Krishna. Nara and Nârâyana
became great ascetics, practicing severe penances. They stayed in the Badarika
âsrama doing tapas (austerities) for a thousand years. Hari and Krishna became
great yogis.
In the battle after the Churning of the Milky Ocean Nara and Nârâyana
helped the devas defeat the asuras (demons). Indra entrusted Nara with the task
of safeguarding the pot of nectar (amrita) won in that contest.
During the destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice (Daksha yâga), S ́iva’s trident
went astray and sailed all the way to the as ́rama (hermitage) where Nara and
Nârâyana were meditating. It hit Nârâyana in the chest. Nârâyana used the sound
Hum to eject it and send it back to S ́iva. When S ́iva came to destroy the two sages,
Nara created an ax from a piece of grass and stopped S ́iva’s destruction.
Once there was a contest with the asura king Prahlâda. Nara and Nârâyana
both used their divine bows and arrows, but it was Nârâyana who finally
defeated Prahlâda. And it was Prahlâda who realized that he had been in a con
text with Vishnu. A stanza in the Mahâbhârata said that Nara was one of the
four incarnations of Vishnu in the Manushya Yuga of the Svâyambhuva Man
vantara (first age of the first cosmic cycle).
According to the Devî Bhâgavata Nara and Nârayana were reborn as Arjuna
and S ́rî Krishna in the Dvâpara Yuga (the third age of this cosmic cycle)
because of a curse of the sage Brighu.

NÂRADA
A celestial sage
After Brahmâ had created the seven sages (sapta-rishis) from his mind (mânasâ
putras), he created Rudra (a storm god) from his anger, Nârada from his lap, Dak
sha (a progenitor) from his right thumb, and Vîranî from his left. The Purânas
accounted for seven of his rebirths, including as a gandharva (celestial musician)
named Uparbarhana, as emperor Drumilla’s son Nârada, then again as Brahmâ’s
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 221



son Nârada (but ending that lifetime as a monkey), as the son of Daksha as
Nârada, as a worm, and even as a woman sage and mother of sixty children. The
Purânas were not able to construct a consistent notion of which manvantaras
(cosmic cycle) these births occurred in. But with so many lifetimes and so little
need for consistency, Nârada made an appearance in more different stories than
perhaps any other figure in Hindu mythology.
A few good examples would include Nârada’s frustrating Daksha-Prajâpati’s
attempt at creation by coition (of course Daksha cursed Nârada to forever be a
wanderer), Nârada telling Citrasena about S ́iva’s desire to kill him so that Cit
rasena escaped death, Nârada telling Pârvatî about S ́iva killing her son Vigh
neshvara who had prevented S ́iva from entering the room where she was
bathing, Nârada losing to Haritâs ́va in a musical contest, Nârada telling Râma
about a s ́ûdra named Jambuka who was doing ascetic practices even though he
did not have a right to because of his caste, Nârada telling Kamsa that he was
the product of the rape of his mother, and many more.
Nârada’s treatment in the later Purânas fit into the pattern found there of
projecting lust into the narrative of the great. Brahmâ cursed Nârada with sen
suality, and Nârada cursed Brahmâ that his own lust would make him unworthy
of worship. Nârada picked up a number of epithets that summarized his charac
ter: strife-maker (kali-kâraka), monkey-faced (kapi-vaktra), spy (pishuna).

NARAKA, NARAKÂSURA
An asura (demon)
Hiranyâksha in the form of a boar had abducted the earth, Bhûmî, and taken her
to Pâtâla, one of the netherworlds. On the way his tusks touched Bhûmî, and she
became pregnant with Naraka. Vishnu came in the form of a boar, Varâha, and
killed Hiranyâksha. Vishnu rescued Bhûmî and had pity on her baby asura son,
Naraka. Vishnu gave him the divine weapon Nârâyanâstra and a boon that no
one could kill him but Vishnu.
This is the formula for certain tragedy in the Purânas—but it was usually
caused by the conceit of Brahmâ giving such a boon. Narakâsura used his boon
well and caused a lot of suffering among the devas (gods) as he was growing up.
The Mahâbhârata stated that Naraka raped Kasherû, daughter of Tvashthâ, then
abducted 16,100 maidens and brought them to his harem. No one could defeat
him. Finally Naraka was killed by S ́rî Krishna, who was of course an incarnation
of Vishnu.

NARASIMHA
An incarnation of Vishnu
Narasimha was the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu. He was the fourth of ten
incarnations and was half man (nara) and half lion (simha). An appearance of
Lord Vishnu was needed to defeat each of the rebirths of the demon twins, Jâya
and Vijâya, who sprang from a curse by Vishnu of his doorkeepers in heaven.
Vishnu had already incarnated as a boar to take care of Hiranyâksha, and now he
incarnated in a special way to kill Hiranyakas ́ipu.
To begin at the beginning, once again Brahmâ’s vanity had allowed an asura
to gain a boon (vara) of immortality. This demon, Hiranyakas ́ipu, was the
brother of Hiranyâksha, whom Vishnu had had to kill to end the rule of evil in
the previous age. Since immortality boons are always provisional, not absolute,
Hiranyakas ́ipu asked that he might not be killed by any of the kinds of beings
that he could imagine, nor killed in heaven or on earth, not inside or outside, not
in the day or in the night. Once his austerities (tapas) and his praise of Brahmâ
had won this boon, he became fearless and invincible. He and his hosts ended
goodness, drove the gods (devas) out of heaven, and brought calamity to earth.
How would goodness and right order (dharma) be restored and by whom?
These paradoxes were solved by Vishnu alone among the gods (proving him
once again to be both the supreme god and the Absolute) when Vishnu took an
incarnation that was a combination of beings—a man-lion. There was rich mate
rial in this myth for those who were devoted to Vishnu, since it was a striking
example of the way he would come down in any age when evil began to reign. He
killed the demonic powers that thwarted the divine order, and—in this instance
that prevented the demon’s own son, Prahlâda, from worshipping Vishnu. So
Vishnu manifested himself as Narasimha from a stone pillar in the twilight (nei
ther day nor night), took Hiranyakas ́ipu upon his lap (so that he was neither in
heaven nor on earth), and disemboweled the demon for his blasphemy. But Vishnu
also did this for the good of Hiranyakas ́ipu—so that he could be blessed by the very
touch of the Supreme and thereby be readied for another and better rebirth.

Daksha. His four sons were Nara, Nârâyana, Hari, and Krishna. Nara and
Nârâyana became great Rishis (sages) practicing severe penances. They stayed in
the Badarika âsrama (hermitage) doing tapas (austerities) for a thousand years.
Hari and Krishna became great yogins. Nârâyana shared many of the episodes of
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 223

his life with his brother Nara. Nârâ
yana and Nara’s tapas heated up
Indra’s throne, so he was determined
to bring their tapas to an end. Indra
arrived at their as ́rama on his ele
phant Airâvata and roared that he
would give the sages a boon (vara).
But they ignored him. Next Indra sent
frightening animals, and finally he
sent his best—an army of apsaras
(celestial damsels) and their atten
dants. The apsaras included Rambhâ,
Menakâ, and Ghritâcî. The sages
came out of their meditation and
enjoyed listening to the singing and
watching the dancing. Then Nârâyana
decided to teach Indra a lesson. He
slapped his thigh (ûru) and created a young woman more beautiful than all of
Indra’s army of beauties. He named her Urvas ́î (the one from a thigh). Indra’s
beauties became afraid in the presence of such powerful sages. They apologized
and propitiated the sages, who sent them all away with Urvas ́î as a gift to Indra.

OM OR AUM
The primal sound
In the Vedic period Om became the holiest invocation (mantra) in Hindu
mythology and religion. Om was a contraction of the vowels a and u and the
anusvâra m. In this one sound were encapsulated the conceptions about sound
(Vâc), about its effectiveness in the Vedic fire rituals, and about the vibratory
nature of the universe. Om was the name given to the one sound that contained
everything else (ekakshara), the one thing that was not perishable (akshara), and
it was the one sound that should begin and end every ritual (pranava). By the
time of the Upanishads the magical power of Om in the sacrificial rituals car
ried over into the meditations of the seers (rishis). It was said that the one who
knows that Om is the imperishable or who meditates on Om could attain
Brahman (the Absolute).
In the Laws of Manu (Manuva S ́âstra) it was said that Prajâpati, the creator,
had taken the milk of three cows (the three Vedas) and created the three ele
ments of Om (a, the first vowel; u, the last vowel; and the anusvâra “m” as the

Brahmâ (the creator), Vishnu (the preserver), and S ́iva (the destroyer).

PÂNCAKANYÂ
The five ideal women
Literally, pânca-kanyâ means the five “girls” or “daughters,” but it is used in
Hindu mythology to refer to five heroines. The list does vary, especially as some
of the heroines were defamed by the mythmakers of the Purânic period.
The five ideal women are role models for all Hindus. They are not perfect
but they fulfill their dharma as mothers, sisters, wives, and occasionally leaders
in their own right. They are most often listed as Ahalyâ, Draupadî, Mandodarî,
Sîtâ, and Târâ.

The collective name of the five sons of King Pandu

his second wife Mâdrî. They were in the order of birth: Dharmaputra (Yud

PANDU
Father of the Pandava brothers of the great Bhârata war
Pandu was born of the sage Vyâsa and Ambalikâ. The child was named Pandu
because of his pale skin. It was a substitutionary parentage—one in which a king
used a sage to have a child by his queen. (For more details see the entries on
Dhritarâshthra and Vyâsa.)
One day Pandu was hunting in the forest. He saw two deer and shot one of
them. But the deer was a sage named Kindama. He had changed into a deer to
sport with his wife, and now Pandu’s arrow had separated them. So before he
226 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



died the sage cursed Pandu: he too would die if he ever touched his wife—and
leave a widow just as he had left the sage’s wife a widow with his careless shot.
After his two wives had become pregnant by divine intervention, Pandu and
his wife Mâdrî were walking in the garden. Pandu felt an irresistible urge to
embrace Mâdrî. At that moment, despite Mâdri’s protest, he dropped over dead.
Mâdrî and Kuntî prepared the funeral pyre, and Mâdrî was chosen to be the one
to join her husband on the pyre (sati). Kuntî raised all five of the sons that were
born to the two mothers as the Pandava brothers.

PARÂSARA
A renowned sage
Parâsara was born to S ́aktri and his wife Adrisyanti. Parâsara’s father S ́aktri was
eaten by a rakshâsa (night-wandering demon) before he was born. So Parâsara
grew up with an immense hatred for Rakshâsas. So this great sage of the sacrifi
cial lore performed a mighty sacrifice (yâga) that began destroying all rakshâsas.
Thousands died in the fire pit. His grandfather, the Mahârishi (great sage)
Vasishtha, felt sorry for the rakshâsas and advised his grandson to abandon the
yâga. Vasishtha said that anger burned up a lifetime of honorable deeds and aus
terities so it was best abandoned. Brahmâ was so pleased with Parâsara for obey
ing Vasishtha that he sent his son, the Mahârishi Pulastya, to tell Parâsara of the
boon he would receive. When Vasishtha saw Pulastya, he honored him with the
customary flowers and water (arghya), and then both of them blessed Parâsara.
He was told that he would become the author of the Purâna Samhitâ.
Parâsara was the father of the sage Vyâsa, who was born to him by a fisher
woman called Satyavâtî. Some of the chapters (suktâs) in the first book (man
dala) of the Rigveda were said to have been written by him. Parâsara became
known as the founder of the most important of the lineages of teachers (guru
paramparâ).

PARASU-RÂMA
(1) A well-known sage; (2) An avatâra (incarnation) of Vishnu
The story of “Ax Râma” (the literal meaning of Parasu-Râma) contains a chill
ing warning to the kings and rulers of India. Brâhmins could revolt against them
if their rule was unjust or cruel.
The story proving the need for an incarnation of Vishnu began with the
curse of a sage. The god (deva) Agni had gone to King Kârtavîryârjuna and asked
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 227



for food. The king gave Agni permission to take as much food as he wanted, any
time, anywhere. Agni went on a rampage, burning forests and mountains. A sage
named Âpava lost his as ́rama (hermitage) in one of the forest fires and cursed the
king: Vishnu would come to earth to end the arrogance of the warrior caste
(ks ́atriyas).
So Vishnu was born as Parasu-Râma into the home of the brâhmin sage
Jamdagni. He and his wife Renukâ already had four sons, so Parasu-Râma was
their fifth. Parasu-Râma studied under his father and was his best student. One
day Renukâ was late returning from fetching water from the river. In fact she
had lost all track of time as she watched love play in the river—a reminder of
the life she had lost when her royal father married her to a simple brâhmin.
Jamdagni was angry and demanded an explanation. She told why she was late
and implied that she had been tempted with unclean thoughts at the sight of
lovemaking in the river. Her husband ordered each of his sons in turn to kill
their mother. Finally, Parasu-Râma did as his father ordered. When his pleased
father granted him a boon for his obedience, Parasu-Râma asked that his mother
be restored to life.
Parasu-Râma trained in archery and did austerities (tapas) to S ́iva. Some sto
ries told how he helped S ́iva defeat demons invading heaven. Finally Parasu
Râma was ready for his task.
King Kârtavîryârjuna came one day to the hermitage and asked for food and
drink. Some accounts stated that Jamdagni provided a feast for him and his
entourage with the miraculous products of his divine cow, Sushîlâ. Other
accounts stated that King Kârtavîryârjuna came when Jamdagni was away and
was fed by Renukâ. Either way, the king wanted the divine cow and stole it, then
or subsequently. In each version Jamdagni was killed while Parasu-Râma and his
brothers were away from the as ́rama. When Parasu-Râma returned, he found his
mother beating her breast in agony. For each of the twenty-one times she hit her
self Parasu-Râma went on to lead an attack on ks ́atriya kings. The lost cow was
returned with her calf. Parasu-Râma went about South India killing men,
women, and children to rid the earth of evil rulers. (His name became associated
with the origin of the State of Kerala. In fact, a historical brâhmin’s story may
have been incorporated into the myth of Parasu-Râma, an incarnation of
Vishnu.)
Parasu-Râma, the fifth of ten incarnations of Vishnu, was born in the tretâ
yuga—not this age, but the previous one. That was an age when ks ́atriyas did not
follow their dharma to rule justly and to protect Vedic wisdom.
Another version of the reason for Vishnu’s need to incarnate had an inter
esting twist. A King Arjuna (note the twist in the story when the villain has the
name of one of Hindu mythology’s greatest heroes) was a merciless tyrant. This
228 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Arjuna had worshipped Brahmâ and obtained a boon that prevented any ks ́atriya
from taking his life. Thus, Vishnu had to incarnate as a brâhmin in order to
reestablish divine order and proper rule.

PARÎKSHIT
A king
Parîkshit had a miraculous birth. At the very end of the war told of in the
Mahâbhârata, one of the last surviving Kauravas launched the magical weapon
of Brahmâ (a Brahmashira) to exterminate all of the Pandavas, but Arjuna had an
equal weapon that he launched to defeat it. However, the future Parîkshit’s preg
nant mother was struck in the abdomen by the Kauravas’ terrible weapon. She
barely survived, and Parîkshit was killed in the womb. Krishna cursed the
attacker for his evil deed. When Parîkshit was stillborn, his mother Uttarâ
pleaded with Krishna to give life to the child even though it was three months
premature. Krishna did, and Parîkshit came to life.
Parîkshit grew to manhood, married princess Mâdravatî, and by her had four
sons. Because Yudhishthira abdicated rather than rule his destroyed kingdom,
Parîkshit was enthroned as the King of Hastinapura, the grandson of Arjuna, and
one of the last Pandavas of the candra-vams ́a (lunar royal line).
Parîkshit loved hunting. One day after a long and tiring hunt in the forest,
he came upon a hut and asked an old man for a drink. The old man, however,
did not move. So the king threw a dead cobra on him. Still, the sage sat totally
silent, not aware of his presence or that of the snake. The king returned to his
palace. There are a number of variations at this point in the story. The sage’s son,
S ́amîka (or Gavijâta or S ́ringi), was teased by other brâhmin boys or came home
and discovered the perceived insult to his father. In any case, S ́amîka was
offended by the joke and put a death curse on King Parîkshit: he had only seven
days to live.
In another variant the son of Nâgabhushana (“one having snakes as his
ornament,” i.e., S ́iva), Gavijâta, was teased by companions that his father was
really “one having dead snakes as his ornament.” The son immediately cursed
the one who had done this: he would be bitten by the king of snakes, Takshâka,
and die within seven days. When he learned the circumstances, he went to the
king and warned him of the curse so that there might be counter measures. But
Parîkshit stated that he was ready to die when the time for death came.
In yet another variation Parîkshit had his engineers build a new palace on a
pillar in the middle of the ocean with psychics and yogis protecting him. The
giant serpent Takshâka made a final attempt on the seventh day. Disguised as
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 229



an old priest, Takshâka met Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods, on his way
to protect the king. After they became friends, Dhanvantari returned home. Tak
shâka changed his shape and entered an apple being taken to King Parîkshit.
When the king picked up the apple, Takshâka changed into his true shape and
size and killed Parîkshit instantly.
The king’s son Janamejaya sought revenge and attempted to rid the earth of
snakes by doing a great snake sacrifice (Nâga yâga). Parîkshit did not attain
heaven (svarga) when he died, so the sage Nârada advised Janamejaya to do a sac
rifice for the salvation of the spirit of his father (ambâ-yâga). The sacrifice
required many brâhmins, who were all richly rewarded with gifts. Nârada
announced at the end of the yâga that Parîkshit had attained a seat beside Devî
in heaven.

PÂRVATÎ
A devî (goddess), daughter of Himâlaya, wife of S ́iva
Pârvatî, goddess of the mountain, Himâlaya, primary wife of S ́iva, mother of at
least two of S ́iva’s sons, is by far the most complicated of Hindu goddesses. She
is given differing and often contradictory natures by the three main perspectives
of later mythology—S ́âktas (those who worship the divine mother), S ́aivas (those
who worship S ́iva as the Supreme), and Vaishnavas (those who worship Vishnu
as the Supreme). Scholars often classify Pârvatî as a “cool,” or orthodox, mani
festation of Devî, yet she also has her own “hot” aspects.
Pârvatî is complex even as wife of S ́iva and mother of two sons. Part of the
tension derives from the ambiguous nature of S ́iva—both an ascetic and a hus
band. Some myths attempted to preserve his asceticism even though he had
sons. Some made a concession: he had to end his austerities (tapas) to provide a
divine son by Pârvatî in order to conquer evil. S ́iva was aroused from his medi
tation (or austerities—not always the same) by Kâma, the god of love, to marry
Pârvatî. However, an ascetic should not be aroused by Kâma or actually con
summate marriage, so Pârvatî’s motherhood was often denied by S ́aivite ver
sions. In these versions, it was because these sons of S ́iva were either S ́iva’s
creations from his mind or by Pârvatî’s own mind-creations, that Pârvatî
acknowledged Ganes ́a (originally named Vighneshvara) and Subrahmanya (also
known as Skanda and Kârttikeya) as her sons. For more details on the many ver
sions of the story of each of these two sons, see the individual entries. Yet, there
were also several more children—another son and daughter, Andhaka and
As ́okasundarî—again raising the question whether they were mind-born from
one or the other parents. Many other sons of S ́iva, such as the sage Durvâsa, were
230 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Pârvatî, daughter of Himalaya, wife of S ́iva, and one form of the Mother, Devî (TRIP)



accounted for alternately as manifestations. The idea of manifestation of the
Supreme is less mythical, less anthropomorphic, and less problematical—and
does not require a real wife or mother.
There are a number of accounts that are not ascetic in regard to paternity
issues. Several semi-divine beings come from the love play (coition) of S ́iva and
Pârvatî: Andhaka (a demon) and Hanuman (a divine monkey). Pârvatî could be
quite rambunctious in her love play. It was said in the Vâlmîki Râmâyana that
Pârvatî and S ́iva’s love play rocked the foundations of the heavens and the earth,
so both the gods and earth complained to S ́iva. He stopped, but Pârvatî became
angry. She cursed Bhûmî-devî (mother earth): she would become many forms
and be the wife of many. Pârvatî also stated that, since Bhûmî had prevented her
from having a son, Bhûmî-devî would have no more children. On another occa
sion Pârvatî cursed citraketu and his wife for laughing at her love play with S ́iva,
which they chanced to see.
While S ́iva and Pârvatî were married and thus should have served as a divine
model for the householder life, their relationship was not always desirable. S ́iva
was usually the problem. One day S ́iva had behaved so badly, abusing the devas
(gods) and his wife Pârvatî, that she decided to leave him. In order to prevent
this, S ́iva discarded that portion of himself that was making life miserable for
everyone—to be born as a sage, Durvâsa.
Another time S ́iva received a woman visitor named Madhurâ at Kailâsa
while Pârvatî was away. Madhurâ came to worship S ́iva but was rewarded with
special favors. When Pârvatî returned to Kailâsa, she saw Madhurâ’s breast
smeared from the ash of S ́iva’s body. Pârvatî went into a fury and cursed Mad
hurâ. S ́iva was not able to do anything.
When Pârvatî was first born as Satî, the daughter of Daksha, she wedded
S ́iva. This episode complicated Pârvatî’s character beyond most mythmakers’
abilities to restore clarity. Pârvatî would be the eternal wife of S ́iva, yet it was
S ́iva’s angry sweat as Bhadrakâlî (an aspect of Pârvatî), coming to protest Dak
sha’s snub of S ́iva as Satî (another manifestation of Pârvatî) and killing Daksha,
Satî’s father. Satî burned herself in Daksha’s Brâhmanical fire sacrifice, becom
ing the paradigm for “widow-burning” (sati) as an act of purification.
When S ́iva learned of his wife Satî’s self-immolation in the sacrificial fire of
her father Daksha, he loosened his matted hair in full anger. Out of this angry
energy was born two attendants: Vîrabhadra and Bhadrakâlî. Bhadrakâlî was Pâr
vatî in another form. S ́iva sent Vîrabhadra and Bhadrakâlî to kill Daksha. Even
though Bhadrakâlî was Pârvatî’s manifestation, her actions were seen in the
myths as S ́iva’s karma, making him a brâhmin-killer. It was S ́iva, not Pârvatî,
who had to do penance.
Pârvatî seemed to need to be where the action was and sometimes got into
232 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



trouble because of it. Pârvatî complained to S ́iva that she had not been given a
role in Vishnu’s Râma incarnation. Therefore, S ́iva caused her to lose con
sciousness of her true nature and be reborn as Lankâ-Lakshmî, a doorkeeper or
guardian in Lanka for Râvana. She fought with Hanuman who knocked her
unconscious with a blow from his left hand. When she regained consciousness,
she remembered that she was Pârvatî as Bhadrakâlî. She thanked Hanuman and
returned to Kailâsa and S ́iva. Pârvatî’s role in the Krishna incarnation was most
dramatic. In order for Krishna to escape death at his birth by the hands of his evil
uncle Kamsa, a baby girl was substituted. As Kamsa tried to kill her, Bhadrakâlî
appeared in full glory and power.
Pârvatî is worshipped today in many forms, beginning with Kâlî in the S ́aktî
cult, Tântric forms like Candî, Câmundî, milder forms like Gaurî, Kârtyayanî,
and so on. Candikâ was the furious aspect of the Goddess for those who inter
pret all her manifestations as those of the Supreme.

PAS ́UPATI, PÂS ́UPATI
An epithet
Pas ́upati was an epithet for a divinity that meant “lord of the creatures (pas ́u)”
and “lord of cattle (pâs ́u).” In the early Vedic hymns this appellation pointed to
Agni, the god of fire, whose divine heat (tapas) was creative and destructive
(rudra). Another figure, Purusha (the first man), was also praised as Pas ́upati.
However, it was Rudra as the fire (agni) that kills that finally appropriated the
epithet—or one should say Rudra-S ́iva, since S ́iva appropriated Rudra’s entire
mythology. In the S ́atapatha Brâhmana Rudra accepted birth in order to punish
Prajâpati, the creator, who had had incest with his daughter, and to become ruler
of all creatures.
Rudra-S ́iva was the divine herdsman, the five-faced lord of life, naked,
teacher of the highest and most secret knowledge, possessing the five energizers
(prânas). S ́aiva theology spoke of the three constituents of life—all intercon
nected, all necessary: Pas ́upati (lord), pas ́u (creature), pas ́a (reins, noose, con
troller of karma, of destiny).

PITRIS
The ancestors
The pitris were first a class of demigods (not quite full devas, gods), as well as
the “fathers” or “ancestor spirits.” As a class of demigods they were connected
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 233



with the ritualistic offerings to the spirits of the dead. One of the earliest con
cepts of an afterlife spoke of the way of the fathers (pitri-yana) as distinguished
from the way of the gods (deva-yana). Pitri-yana was associated with the moon,
while deva-yana was the solar way.
Their origin had several explanations. In one version the pitris were created
by the seven sages (Sapta-Rishis) who were created by Brahmâ. Another version
stated that Brahmâ himself created the pitris, including three classes of embod
ied and four classes of disembodied spirits. The embodied pitris were called
Agnishvattas, Barhishads, and Somapâs. The disembodied pitris were the indi
vidual deities Yama, Anala, Soma, and Aryaman.
In both household (grihatya) and public (s ́rauta) rituals, the lineage, even
today, is mentioned back three generations—father, grandfather, and great
grandfather. The pitris are offered water and rice balls (pandas).

PRAHLÂDA
A demon; a devotee of Vishnu
Prahlâda was the son of the asura Hiranyakas ́ipu. His father became emperor of
the demons and attempted to have everyone worship him. However, his own
son, Prahlâda, refused and continued to worship Vishnu. Prahlâda would have
been killed if Vishnu had not incarnated in just the right way, as the man-lion
Narasimha, to be able to kill Hiranyakas ́ipu. The killing was unusually bloody,
with Narasimha ripping out Hiranyakas ́ipu’s intestines and wearing them as a
garland in a naked dance that lasted only a moment. Then Vishnu appeared to
Prahlâda, blessed him, and disappeared.
After his father’s death Prahlâda became emperor of the demons in Pâtâla
(the netherworld). He gave up the administration of his kingdom in order to prac
tice austerities (tapas) and worship Vishnu. His grandson Bali, though a great
menace to the gods, was another famous asura devotee of Vishnu.

PRAJÂPATI, PRAJÂPATIS
A creator god; the office of creators or grandfathers
Prajâpati was first a Vedic god (deva) of real importance, only to be reduced over
the centuries to the function of a group (rank) of gods. Prajâpati literally means
the lord of creatures, of living beings. During the period of the Brahmanas he
was the supreme being and father of the gods. He may have had his own cults.
But his supremacy was taken over by Brahmâ, who was seen as creating Prajâ
234 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



pati to be his (Brahmâ’s) agent of creation. Later still, the myths tell of other Pra
jâpatis also being created by Brahmâ to carry out all the aspects of creation. How
ever, as Vishnu and S ́iva rose to supremacy, Brahmâ came to be seen as their
agent, subcontracting creation to first seven, then ten, and finally twenty-one or
more Prajâpatis, of whom Brahmâ was seen as one.
The twenty-one Prajâpatis who created the rest of the world were Brahmâ,
Rudra, Manu, Daksha, Bhrigu, Dharma, Tapa, Yama, Marîci, Angiras, Atri,
Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishtha, Parameshti, Sûrya, Chandra, Kardama,
Krodha, and Vikrita.
Besides what was going on in theistic mythology with its personal creators,
there was a philosophical school of thought that found the divine to be beyond
name and form (nâma-rupa) as an impersonal Absolute (Brahman), that “cre
ated” only in the sense that all phenomena were seen as a fundamentally unreal
projection (mâyâ) from the Absolute. This change in theology restructured cos
mology and gave primacy to an asceticism of renunciation rather than an ascet
icism for powers and rewards.
However, the mythological viewpoint continued into the present. The Pra
jâpatis or grandfathers continued as the re-creators after each destruction or par
tial destruction of the universe. Their continuing proliferation constituted
Hindu mythology’s fundamental rejection of viewpoints that the cosmos is
illusion.

PRAKRITÎ
(1) Matter; (2) A goddess
Prakritî was a term meaning nature, origin, or progress, which was used to
express one of the foundational ideas of India’s earliest philosophical system,
Samkhya (or Sankhya). In Samkhya prakritî was the category of matter or mate
riality. Hindu mythology simplified Samkhya’s complexity and even personified
Prakritî as a goddess (devî).
However, before prakritî was personified, the early Vedic hymns linked
matter with other notions of creation or origin such as the first man, or first
being (purusha) in Rigveda 10.90, the father of beings or creatures (Prajâpati),
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 235



and even the large, or great, self (mahan atman). By the fifth century of the com
mon era, these associations developed into a theory of evolution in mature
Samkhya thought.
Prakritî was understood as unconscious and its opposite, purusha, as con
scious. While Samkhya built the universe—that whole—from its two founda
tional constituents, other philosophical schools attacked these views as
dualistic, and, therefore, incapable of getting behind these two to the One. From
their point of view, the two fundamental constituents were themselves created
by the One (Brahman) or the one Supreme, as Devî, Vishnu, or S ́iva.

PRALAYA
A concept
Pralaya (“dissolution”) generally meant the destruction of one creation before
the next. Chapter 2 deals with Hindu conceptions of time and of multiple cre
ations.
The Agni Purâna mentioned four kinds of pralaya: a daily destruction
(nityapralaya), the destruction at the end of a kalpa or a day of Brahmâ
(Brâhmapralaya), the destruction at the end of a thousand catur-yugas (Prâkri
tapralaya), and the final destruction and dissolution of the individual self
(âtman) and absorption into the Supreme Self (âtyantika-pralaya).

PRÂNA, PRÂNAS
A concept
Prâna means “breath” or “life” and by extension could mean “energy” or “life
force.” There was one hymn in the Atharvaveda in which Prâna was personified
as a deva (god). It was, however, as life force that prâna appeared in Hindu
mythology.
In the practice of yoga (especially hatha yoga) the five primary breaths (prâ
nas or vâyus) and the five secondary ones (upaprâna) circulated in the vital path
ways (nadis). These breaths were controlled (in the practice called prânayâma)
to gain mastery over the senses. This mastery over the senses was central to
practicing austerities (tapas) and thus accumulating merit (punya) so that one
might receive a boon (vara). Many myths mention prânayâma as the method
being used by a demon or a sage in order to gain a boon from a god.

PURÂNAS
The heart of Hindu mythological literature
Purâna means “ancient” and thus this body of literature claimed to be authori
tative, especially for the kali yuga (the present age). Scholars date their compo
sition in three periods (300–500; 500–1000; 1000–1800). Purânas deal with both
philosophical and existential issues, mostly presented through a poetic narra
tive. The five topics covered in the Purânas are primary and secondary creations
or re-creations, genealogies of gods, kings, and heroes, and the cycles of time and
history. There are eighteen major Purânas and eighteen minor Purânas. Some of
the main Purânas are the Bhâgavata Purâna, Agni Purâna, Skanda Purâna,
Vishnu Purâna, and Padma Purâna.

PURUSHA
The cosmic person
Purusha meant “man” and later by extension “soul” or “consciousness.” It was
utilized both in Hindu mythology and philosophy—often in quite divergent
ways. In the various philosophical-theological schools (dars ́anas), purusha
shared contexts with âtman (self), brahman (Absolute), kshetrajñâ (the knower
of the field). In the great creation hymn of the Rigveda (10.90), purusha was
clearly the first one, linked to its desire for and actual materialization (prakriti).
In the later Vedic period, especially the Upanishads, purusha is pure conscious
ness (cit) and pure self (âtman) alone without materiality (prakriti). The uni
versal self or Absolute (brahman) came to replace purusha completely.
In mythology purusha became a synonym for Brahmâ, the creator, and then
for the supreme being, either Vishnu or S ́iva.

PURIFICATION
See Shuddhi
PÛSHAN
Early Vedic god; an epithet of Sûrya, the Rigvedic sun god
Pûshan was the son of Sûrya, the sun, or an âditya, a son of Kas ́yâpa (a progeni
tor) and Aditi. He was reduced in later mythology to a guardian of the roads, to
toothlessness, and to an eater of gruel.
Pûshan was an early Vedic god (deva) who was connected with Bhaga (god
of inheritance). At the earliest level Pûshan was a god of fertility, associated with
semen and with the offering of soma (the divine nectar). His name implied that
he was a nourishing god, and there seemed to be an early cult conducted by those
who worshipped him because he was believed to make them prosper.
Pûshan’s deeds and epithets came to be appropriated by Sûrya. Before he
faded from importance after the Vedic period, his guarding of the roads implied
his protection on the final road to heaven (svarga).

RÂDHÂ
The consort of S ́rî Krishna
Râdhâ is one of the most popular fig
ures in Hindu mythology and is even
understood by some to be a manifes
tation of the Supreme. Râdhâ has
many personas and a complex myth
ology. Râdhâ is the young, innocent
maiden coming into the forest at
night in response to Krishna’s magi
cal flute. Râdhâ is the favorite wife of
Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu)
from his many wives among the
cowherds of Vrindâvana (Gokula).
And Râdhâ is the wife of Adhiratha
(or Kalâvati) and the foster mother of
Karna (the divine son of Kuntî and
Sûrya). Which of Râdhâ’s many faces
appears in a story is said to be caused
by the listener to her myths—she
takes the aspects of the listeners’ own
mâyâ and is born from their projec
tions—carnal for the carnally minded, innocent as a virgin for the pure, and so on.
Râdhâ began to emerge toward the end of the epic period. Songs to Râdhâ
may have come from a cow-herding community in northern India, the Abhirs.
And it was poetry and song, not mythology per se, that fueled her amazing rise
to supreme importance in Hindu mythology. Although some poems and songs
extolled her as a shy maiden, most presupposed that she was married. As her
association with Krishna grew, Vaishnava theologians accounted for the fact
that she belonged to another man (parakiya) in several ways: Râdhâ was the
incarnation of Lakshmî; Râdhâ, like Krishna’s other lovers, was eternally mar
ried to him, incarnating in this lifetime to be near him.
Râdhâ could be seen in some myths as the personification of loving devotion
to the Supreme (prema bhakti). However, Râdhâ also began to appropriate the
characteristics and attributes of Lakshmî and even Durgâ: power (s ́haktî), nature
(prakritî), creation (mâyâ). Râdhâ assumed the role of Lakshmî, wife of Vishnu,
as the intercessor between God (appearing as Krishna) and humanity.
In spite of all her religious importance, however, Râdhâ’s complete surren
der to love of Krishna in every mood, rehearsed constantly for each generation in
songs, plays, art, and now films, has made her stories eternal.

RÂHU
An asura (demon)
Râhu can be seen as the earliest Vedic astrological pre-science embedded in a
story—the ascending and descending nodes created as the moon’s orbit inter
sects the ecliptic plane of the earth, used in predicting solar and lunar eclipses.
Mythologically, Râhu was one of the great demons (daityas) at the Churn
ing of the Milky Ocean. Râhu managed to change his shape and drink from the
pot of immortality-giving nectar (amrita). The sun (Sûrya) and moon (Candra)
discovered what he had done and informed Vishnu, who immediately cut off his
head. The upper part, the ascending node, was Râhu, while the lower part of his
body was Ketu, the descending node, the dragon’s tail. Râhu would forever
attack the sun and moon as they came near, swallowing each of them—only to
have them fall out of his severed neck. Some versions gave him a chariot with
eight black horses, racing back and forth across the heavens to attack each of his
old enemies.
The Purânas stated that Râhu was the son of Kas ́yâpa (a progenitor) by his
wife Simhikâ, therefore, a daitya. Râhu was worshipped as one of the nine plan
ets (navagraha) in temples.

RÂKSHASA
One of a class of asuras (demons)
Râkshasas were often described as a subset of the asuras. Other subsets were
240 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



yakshas and daityas. The word râkshasa came from the root raksh, meaning to
guard. They may have originally been guardians, as one myth indicated that
when Brahmâ created the waters, he created râkshasas to guard them. Individ
ual râkshasas were often good but prone to getting cursed by the gods. Râvana
was sufficiently evil to make up for any who were not. Their origin was vari
ously explained as being created from the foot of Brahmâ, or from the paternity
of one of two grandfathers (prajâpatis)—Pulastya or Kas ́yâpa.
Râkshasas were given many epithets that suggest that heroes or incarna
tions would be needed to kill them: killers, offering thieves, cannibals, night
stalkers, blood-drinkers, and the like.

RÂMA
The seventh incarnation of Vishnu
The Râma myth cycle is especially complex because there are so many literary
and oral versions, each language of India having its own variations, as well as
expressions in art, dance, drama, and film or video. Since Râma was an incarna
tion of Vishnu, his story is nested within the Vishnu myth cycle, requiring sto
ries about the need for another incarnation and its outcome. Some of the power
of the basic story can be suggested by the fact that it traveled all the way to the
island of Bali (then considered a part of greater India), to be performed there to
this day.
While the variations are complex, the plot would be simple without nested
stories about previous births and rebirths. Râma was the elder son of King
Das ́aratha by his first wife Kausalyâ. Râma was a one-half incarnation of Vishnu,
being conceived from a half portion of divine pudding, given by Vishnu. Das ́a
ratha’s other wives, Kaikeyî and Sumithrâ, received the other half and also con
ceived sons. (For more details see entry on Das ́aratha.) Das ́aratha prepared to
crown Râma as king or as king-regent, but his second wife Kaikeyî demanded
that she be granted now boons she had won long ago. (See entry on Kaikeyî for
more details.) Râma helped his father with the decision to grant her the boons,
so that he could fulfil his duty (svadharma). Thus Râma, his brother Laksh
mana, and his wife Sîtâ went into exile, according to the wish of his stepmother.
After about ten years of exile in the forest, the three moved, on the advice
of the sage Agastya, into a region where there were dangerous râkshasas
(demons). One of them, Sûrpanakhâ, saw Râma and fell in love. What happened
next, Râma’s rejection of her and Sûrpanakhâ’s mutilation at the hands of the
brothers, provoked her older brother Râvana to seek revenge. (For more details
see Lakshmana.) Râvana abducted Sîtâ, though fortunately prevented by a curse
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 241



from raping her as he had done to so
many women, including his nephew’s
wife. Râvana took Sîtâ to Lanka. Râma
won the aid of Hanuman and Sugrîva
and their monkey armies. (Was this a
disguised reference to South Indians,
Dravidians, helping Râma?) Hanuman
built a causeway or bridge from the
Indian subcontinent to Lanka, and
Râvana was finally defeated. Techni
cally, the reason for Vishnu’s incarna
tion was complete. However, the
myth’s significance for modern India
continued, with Râma’s return to Ayo
dhyâ and setting up of his divine rule
there. (In 1992 and 2002 Ayodhyâ was
the focus of communal killings in the
hundreds provoked by a desire to set
up another period of ideal Hindu rule
from Râma’s birthplace and capital.)
Râma’s rule restored virtue and
order (dharma) and brought a golden age. Nevertheless, several incidents marred
this perfect period. Râma did not support Sîtâ powerfully against the charge that
she was polluted after she had lived in the house (or palace) of another man. Sîtâ
was forced to perform a fire ritual to prove her purity, then banished anyway into
the ever dangerous forests for most of her life, or in some versions, the rest of it.
This ending has been revised constantly because it is central to the theme
of the relationship between the perfect king and the perfect wife. This conflicted
aspect of the myth cycle has been reworked in numerous ways in order to
attempt to overcome some of the ambiguities. The following is generally agreed:
Sîtâ was blameless, an ideal wife. She followed her husband to the forest and
waited for Râma to come and rescue her in Lanka without yielding to Râvana’s
temptations. She was both courageous and faithful in every way. After her res
cue and Râvana’s death, her life took a sad turn. Râma abandoned the pregnant
Sîtâ because of the verdict of the people of his country: that Sîtâ must not be
pure after having stayed in Lanka for such a long time. In many versions of the
myth, public opinion led Râma to denounce Sîtâ.
There are several endings to this myth. One brings Sîtâ back to the throne;
another has her returning to her mother, the earth. They begin in much the same
way. After abandoning Sîtâ, Râma ruled the country for many years. Once his
242 Handbook of Hindu Mythology

(TRIP)



sons by Sîtâ, Lava and Kusa, came to visit him. They pleaded that he take their
mother back. They, along with their mother, were being looked after by the sage
Vâlmîki. Râma accepted Sîtâ back and restored her to the palace as his queen.
The latest versions—with this correction—end happily here. However, the ear
lier versions had a different ending. After her return to the palace, the murmur
ing of the people began again: she was not chaste (pure) enough to be the wife of
Râma. And Râma abandoned Sîtâ again. This time she chose to return to the
earth, her mother (Bhû-devî). The earth split apart and took her—entering back
into the furrow from which she was born.
Râma did not live long after Sîtâ’s death. He drowned himself in the river
Sarayu. (Or, it was also said that he went through water purification to heaven.)
Râma and Sîtâ returned to Vaikuntha and were merged into Vishnu and Lakshmî.

RÂMÂYANA
An Epic
The Râmâyana is one of the two great Epics of Hindu mythological literature.
The other is the Mahâbhârata. The Râmâyana was said to have been authored
by the sage Vâlmîki. The Râmâyana dealt with the story of S ́rî Râma and Sîtâ.
The Râmâyana is divided into two sections, the first with six books (kan
das) and the second with one. The first and seventh books are believed by most
scholars to have been added later to the original. The traditional view in India,
however, is that the whole was created by Vâlmîki, even though there were
three recensions, none of which contain more than two-thirds that is common
to the others. Tradition places its action in the treta yuga, or second age of this
era. That means that the events of Râma’s life preceded those of Krishna’s, that
he made his appearance as an avatâra (incarnation) of Vishnu before Krishna.
Scholars have noted much borrowing of themes and mythic solutions from sto
ries about quite different figures or characters.
The Râmâyana gathered folk tales of a local prince Râma of Kosala who had
been sung about for centuries by martial bards. He was a perfect warrior. The lit
erary retellings of the Râma myth by the poets—Vâlmîki, Bhasa, Kalidasa, and
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 243



Bhavabhuti—were more secular than religious, more heroic than ascetic, and all
quite tragic. By about the twelfth century the vernacular and regional poets like
Ramayanas and Tulsidas had transformed not only Râma into the supreme lord
but all elements including Râvana into loving devotion (prema bhakti). Every
thing had become an allegory of devotion, harmony, and bliss.

RÂVANA
A râkshasa (demon)
Râvana was born as the son of Vis ́ravas. Dasânana is another name of Râvana,
and it means one who has ten heads. Râvana’s character changed dramatically in
the many retellings of his actions as the central antagonist of Râma in the
Râmâyana. At one extreme Râvana was the consummate expression of evil and
at the other an obedient devotee of Râma (Tulsidas’ version).
244 Handbook of Hindu Mythology
In the epic Râmâyana Hanuman serves Râma with pure devotion. (TRIP)



It is the story of Râvana as a ten-headed, shape-shifting abductor of Sîtâ that
all India has loved century after century. They have loved the Râvana who kept
getting cursed by the sages because of his evil actions. Râvana became the most
well-known râkshasa in Hindu mythological literature, since his life was con
nected with Râma. Râvana’s previous lives were as Jâya and Hiranyâksha. He
was reborn to carry on his program of evil as S ́is ́upâla.

RENUKÂ
A princess who married a sage
Renukâ’s story has many troubling elements. She was a princess (and thus a
ks ́atriya) married to the brâhmin Jamdagni. She gave birth to an avatâra (incar
nation) of Vishnu, Parasu-Râma, whom her husband commanded to kill her. She
was brought back to life. In one version she was raped by King Kârtavîryârjuna,
who stole her divine cow Sushîlâ and then had her husband killed. Then she sent
her son, the youngest with the ax (Parasu-Râma), on twenty-one military expe
ditions to slaughter as many ks ́atriyas as possible. Renukâ jumped into the
funeral pyre (sati) of her husband and died.

RIGVEDA
The oldest Hindu scripture
The Rigveda precedes all other Hindu scriptures in age and sacredness. The
name Rigveda is a compound of rik (verses of “praise”) and veda (book of
“knowledge,” or “wisdom”). It comes to us in such a highly crafted language
(Samskrita, Sanskrit) that it was believed to have been received by the Seven
Sages (sapta-rishis) whose students would memorize each word, each cadence,
each intonation.
Internal evidence suggests that it was composed by quite a few sages, who
gave their names to individual hymns and collections, or chapters (s ́uktas).
These were organized into ten books (mandalas). One recension consisted of
10,472 verses (riks) and 1017 hymns (s ́uktas). These were all handed down
orally, memorized exactly by each generation for more than a thousand—per
haps two thousand—years until finally written down.
Rigvedic hymns praised Indra, Agni, Soma, Sûrya, Brahmâ, Purusha,
Prakritî, Varuna, Mitra, Ushas, and (briefly) Vishnu. The hymns presupposed
very ancient stories or myths but did not spell them out; in spite of that, they
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 245



contain a treasury of mythic themes, which were shaped and reshaped over the
succeeding periods. There are several theological-philosophical hymns, such as
the Purusha S ́ukta and the Nâsadiya S ́ukta, that suggest a high level of reflexive
thought, reminding the student of Hindu mythology to look for multiple mean
ings in the same passage—metaphor, allegory, nonliteral allusions. This flexibil
ity of Vedic thought encouraged later Hindu mythmakers to elaborate, conflate,
and exchange quite freely the gods’ life stories and personal characteristics, time
lines, epithets, achievements, and failings.

RISHI
One of a class of teachers
The term rishi means “a seer,” or “one who is foresighted.” In the mythology
the term rishi is interchangeable with sage, or may even be used for a distin
guished priest (brâhmin). Another related term would be guru (teacher). The
246 Handbook of Hindu Mythology
The Rigveda is one of the oldest continuously used scriptures in the world and Hinduism’s
most sacred. (TRIP)



seven sages (sapta-rishis) were also known as the mahârishis—the seven. Some
disciples of modern sages appropriate the ancient title of mahârishi for their
teacher, but properly it refers to those seven who preserve the divine scriptures,
the Vedas, at the beginning of each age.
See also Sapta-rishis
RISHYAS ́RINGA
A brâhmin
Rishyas ́ringa received his strange name, “deer-horned,” because his mother was
a doe. It happened this way: the sage Vibhândaka had been living a strict celibate
life at his as ́rama (hermitage) deep in the forest. One day he saw the beautiful
apsara (celestial damsel) named Urvas ́î. He lost his seed in the pond by which he
was meditating, and a doe immediately drank it. She became pregnant and even
tually gave birth to Rishyas ́ringa. He was a normal human except for a horn in
his forehead—some version place a rack on his head. Rishyas ́ringa was brought
up by Vibhândaka at the as ́rama without any other contact with humans.
The kingdom of Anga was suffering from a drought. The royal sages told
their King Lomapâda that only a brâhmin who had not seen a woman could end
the draught. His men finally found such a person—Rishyas ́ringa. So the king
sent “professional” women to bring him back to his palace. With some effort
they brought him to the king, who promptly married Rishyas ́ringa to his daugh
ter Sântâ. The king sent rich gifts to appease the father, but Vibhândaka ignored
them and came to curse the king. However, upon arriving Vibhândaka realized
that his son had married the princess, so Vibhândaka told Rishyas ́ringa that he
could remain there until he completed the rain sacrifice (yâja) and had a son.
Both missions were accomplished, and Rishyas ́ringa returned to the forest.
In Vâlmîki’s Râmâyana, Rishyas ́ringa was the royal sage at the court of King
Lomapâda when the childless King Das ́aratha of Ayodhyâ asked for help.
Rishyas ́ringa was sent to Ayodhyâ and did the fire ritual called Putrakâmeshthi.
From the sacrificial fire came a monster with a pot of pudding. The being gave
King Das ́aratha the magical potion, which the king in turn gave to his three
wives. The result was the birth of Râma, Bharata, Lakshmana, and S ́atrughna.

RITA
A concept
Rita was a concept in the Rigveda that was associated with cosmic order, as well
as truth and justice. Rita can be said to be a Vedic version of the later concept of
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 247



dharma. Linguists point out rita’s kinship to the Avestan word asha and
Varuna’s place in ancient Persian religion as the ahura (kin to asura, but used to
mean god, not demon) whose all-seeing eye brought truth and justice. In the
Rigveda, Varuna was also an asura whose all-seeing eye brought truth and jus
tice—and was never viewed as a demon.
In the Mahâbhârata, however, Rita was personified as one of the eleven
Rudras (storm gods). Except for this minor reference, rita’s meaning and usage
was appropriated by the term dharma.

RUDRA
A Vedic god; a tântric form of S ́iva
Rudra was a Vedic god (deva) long before S ́iva would have been accepted as Brâh
manical, or orthopraxic. However, the name Rudra was eventually appropriated
for S ́iva, as a designation of a manifestation of S ́iva that was both dangerous and
just within the boundaries of respectability. Even before this process was com
plete, another—that of turning a Vedic god into a class of gods—had taken place.
The Rudras, however, demand their own entry.
In the hymns of the Rigveda, Rudra was the howler, the roarer, and the ter
rible. He was a storm god, either associated with the Maruts (warrior lords) or
their father. His epithets were hara (the remover), îshâna (master, or the ruling
one), Mahâdeva (the great god), and S ́iva (auspicious). Some of these epithets
could be applied to other Vedic gods such as the Maruts, but all were appropri
ated by S ́iva later.
Rigvedic stories of Rudra portrayed him as a wild god, shooting arrows with
out much cause at both gods and men. Rudra only had four hymns offered to him
and, forgotten by the devas as they divided the sacrificial offering, only received
the leftovers. One story told of him as the fiery hunter-warrior, attacking the
creator Prajâpati because of his incest with his daughter Ushas, goddess of the
dawn. Prajâpati made him lord of the creatures (Pas ́upati) to appease him. A
related episode—substituting Brahmâ for Prajâpati—found Rudra collecting seed
that Brahmâ had lost after becoming excited by apsaras (celestial damsels) who
were attending a Vedic sacrifice. Brahmâ had offered his seed to the sacrificial
248 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



fire (an identification of Rudra with Agni, the fire god) and from that offering
three sages were born—Angiras, Marîci, and Bhrigu.
During the next periods Rudra received several versions of his birth, or cre
ation. Most versions told that Rudra was created by Brahmâ out of his own
anger. He was also portrayed as a son of Kas ́yapa and Surabhî, or Kas ́yapa and
Aditi, or even as an androgyne that was divided into male Rudras and female
Rudrânî.
All of this changed in the Purânas. Since Rudra had been called S ́iva (auspi
cious) in the Vedas, S ́iva appropriated every aspect of Rudra. Rudra was the man
ifestation of S ́iva’s anger—at Daksha’s sacrifice or at the sacrifice in which the
devas forgot to give Rudra (S ́iva) a share. At Daksha’s sacrifice S ́iva’s anger far
exceeded that of Rudra when he had been denied a share, before the myth was
appropriated to S ́iva. Rudra plucked out eyes of the gods (as he did with Bhaga, a
Vedic god) or disfigured them, but then restored things later. However, S ́iva as
Rudra (or in some versions as two demonic figures) killed Daksha, a brâhmin, or
plucked off Brahmâ’s head. Thus, S ́iva committed the greatest sacrilege against
dharma—killing a priest. Rudra, as S ́iva’s darker and angrier nature, came to be
associated with this warning to orthodox priests—not to become too arrogant, for
S ́iva’s wrath might manifest itself as the dark hunter-killer. The Kapalikas were
a sect of S ́aivism who carried the skull, just as S ́iva carried Brahmâ’s for his
twelve years of penance, and they were warrior-ascetics, dangerous and fierce.
Rudra’s wife was Prisnî (water bag), an association with his aspect as a storm
god who brought fertilizing rains.
Most recently, Rudra has been worshipped as the Tântric form of S ́iva.

RUDRAS
A troublesome class of gods, storm gods
There are different versions of the number and names of the Rudras. A popular
version was that the Rudras were born to Aditi. That would make them âdityas
(demigods). In the Purânas there were more than eleven Rudras—and they dif
fered in name and number. The eleven Rudras mentioned in the Mahâbhârata
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 249



are Mrigavyâdha, Nirrti, Ahirbudhnya, Pinaki, Sarpa, Ajaikapat, Dahana, Îs ́vara,
Kapâli, Bharga, and Sthanu. In the Vishnu Purâna the names of the eleven
Rudras are Hara, Bahurupa, Tryambaka, Aparajita, Vrishâkapi, Sambhu, Kapardi,
Raivata, Mrigavyadha, Sarva, and Kapâli. Some of these names later became part
of the incarnations of Vishnu or the manifestations of S ́iva. Hanuman was called
the eleventh Rudra by several Purânas.

RUKMINÎ
The most important wife of S ́rî Krishna
Rukminî was the wife of the more mortal version of Krishna. She and Krishna
were in love, but her brother Rukmi opposed the marriage. He hated Krishna and
arranged a marriage of his sister to King S ́is ́upâla. All the kings of the region
came to the wedding celebration, including Krishna, who had been told through
a messenger by Rukminî that she loved him and wanted him to come and take
her away. Krishna secretly left his army some distance from the city, came to the
wedding alone, and promptly stole Rukminî. S ́is ́upâla, Rukmi, and their allies
gave chase, but were surprised and defeated by Krishna’s army. This version
ignores the popular stories of Krishna’s favorite as Râdha and of his dalliance
with the cowherds, the Gopîs. Rukminî was his favorite of five wives, and all
joined him in his funeral pyre at his death.
Rukminî’s connection with Devî (as Lakshmî) was added in the Purânas.
Devî incarnated first as the daughter of Bhrigu, then at the churning of the Milky
Ocean, again when Vishnu was Âditya she was Lakshmî of the lotus, when
Vishnu was Paras ́u-râma (Râma with the ax) she was Bhîmî, when he was Râma
she was Sîtâ, and finally when Vishnu was Krishna she was Rukminî. This
Purânic version then had to be reconciled with the story of Râdha.
See also Krishna; Râdha
S ́ABARÎ
A woman forester
The story of S ́abarî is famous because of her innocent love of S ́rî Râma. However,
this love story is embedded in a rebirth story.
S ́abarî was Mâlinî in her previous life. She was the daughter of a gandharva
king, although she was called an apsara (celestial damsel) by some versions of the
story. Mâlinî was married to an old brâhmin who neglected her in all of his aus
terities. So she took a woodcutter as her lover. When the sage Vîtihotra learned
250 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



what was happening, he cursed Mâlinî to be reborn as a hunter-woman. After
much pleading, Mâlinî was able to get Vîtihotra to reduce the curse: Râma would
be able to absolve her, and she could regain her previous birth as an apsara.
Mâlinî was instantly reborn as S ́abarî, the hunter-woman. S ́abarî discovered
an ascetic (muni) named Matanga, whom she served and from whom she gained
knowledge (brahmanjñâ). One day Râma and Lakshmana came, and she showed
them great respect. She even tasted each fruit that she served to them to make
sure that they were good enough for her guests. Then S ́abarî told Râma and Lak
shmana where to find Sugrîva, son of the sun and monkey ally who would help
them free Sîtâ. She was instantly transformed into a gandharva maiden (or
apsara in some versions). A gandharva prince appeared in a chariot on the divine
plane. It was Vîtihotra—now a gandharva. They saluted Râma and went to the
abode of the gandharvas.
See also Gandharvas; Mâyâ; Râma
S ́AKTÎ
A concept (feminine); the Goddess
S ́aktî is a term for the concept of energy (and as such a feminine noun), and it
can be said to have been personified as Divine Energy, or the Mother Goddess,
the source of energy. The concept is linked to the power of the austerities
(tapas), creative and supernatural powers (siddhis), and the power of the sacri
fice (mâyâ). S ́aivites claimed it as a property of S ́iva, his creative energy (s ́haktî).
Thus, it could be personified as his wife, Devî. And S ́aktî was one of Devî’s
names and one of her manifestations. However, from a S ́akta (a devotee of S ́aktî
as Supreme) perspective, S ́aktî was and is the cosmic energy of the Supreme
Mother. And to illustrate this emphatically, S ́aktas state that S ́iva without s ́aktî
is only s ́ava, corpse. (Removing the feminine “i” ending in the Sanskrit and
derivative languages literally changes the first syllable of S ́iva’s name from S ́i to
S ́a, and thus his name becomes S ́ava.) Thus, it is Mother’s energy that trans
forms the corpse (s ́ava) to a god (S ́iva).
See also Devî; Mâyâ; S ́iva; Tapas
S ́AKUNTALÂ
An apsara (celestial damsel)
S ́akuntalâ’s story is one of the favorite love stories of India, told in quite differ
ent ways by two great poets—Vyâsa and Kalidâsa (both c.400–500). S ́akuntalâ
was the daughter of a sage and an apsara, and her son became an emperor.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 251



S ́akuntalâ’s mother, the famous apsara Menakâ, was sent by Indra to stop
the threat that the sage Vis ́vâmitra’s austerities (tapas) posed to his rule of
heaven (svarga). Menakâ was successful, diverted the sage from his ascetic prac
tice, used up his energy (s ́aktî), and became pregnant. However, as soon as she
delivered, Menakâ left the child beside the Mâlinî River and went back to Indra’s
heaven. The sage Kanva found the baby being tended by birds (s ́akuntas) and
took her back to his as ́rama (hermitage), where he raised her. She grew into a
beautiful young woman. One day when Kanva was away from the as ́rama King
Dushyanta arrived, tired from hunting and hungry. But not too tired. He fell in
love with S ́akuntalâ and married her in the gândarva way (by their own word
and action). After several days he returned to his palace with the promise that he
would send for her. But he forgot. The great poets diverged in the reasons they
gave for this forgetfulness. Vyâsa’s solution has the least complications—the
king just forgot and was reminded by a voice from heaven when mother and son
arrived at his palace many years later.
Kâlidâsa’s version blamed this forgetfulness on a curse from the rascal sage
Durvâsa, whom S ́akuntalâ failed to serve properly when he came to the as ́rama.
However, in this version she did have the king’s signet ring, but she lost it in a
river. She and her grown son Bharata were rejected by King Dushyanta, who
probably had heard paternity claims before. Eventually, a fish was caught with
the ring, and the ring made its way to the king, who then remembered giving it
to a young girl. Dushyanta finally found S ́akuntalâ and Bharata, and Bharata
eventually inherited his father’s throne and became the great emperor who gives
his name to modern India (according to Kâlidasa’s version).

SAMJÑÂ
Wife of Sûrya, the Sun
Samjñâ was the daughter of Vis ́vakarma, the divine architect. When she became
the wife of Sûrya, she could not stand his heat, so she practiced austerities
(tapas) in order to create a substitute. Finally, after having three children—Manu
(the first man), Yama (god of death), and Yamî (goddess of the Yamunâ River)
by Sûrya, she had acquired enough power (siddhis) to create Châyâ, her own
shadow self. Samjñâ had many years of peace (and coolness). Châyâ and Sûrya
had three children—S ́anaishcara, Manu (not one of the Manus), and Tapatî.
Châyâ had done fairly well at raising all six children, but one day she cursed
Yama. Because a mother would never curse her own son, Sûrya knew that she
was not really Yama’s mother. He decided to meditate and realized that Samjñâ
had taken the form of a mare. So Sûrya took the form of a stallion and from their
252 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



love play came the As ́vin twins named Nâsatya and Dasra. They also had
another handsome son named Revanta.
The Bhavishya Purâna differed in details about the children of each of
Sûrya’s wives. A daughter of Châyâ in this account was named Tapatî (daughter
of heat, tapas). Tapatî married King Samvarana after quite a romantic story and
give birth to the emperor Kuru, from whom came the Kaurava line.

SAMNYÂSIN, SAMNYÂSA
The renunciate stage of life
The four life stages (as ́rama-dharma) are viewed by many scholars as joining the
Vedic model of three life stages of the Aryas (“the noble ones,” who were twice
born) with a fourth stage, that of renunciation, which developed outside of the
Aryan or Brâhmanical tradition. The renunciation movement spanned such
diverse movements as Buddhist and Jains, Ajivikas and indigenous ascetics
(munis, yogis, and the like), as well as some anti-Brâhmanical Aryas, those who
produced the earliest elements of the Upanishads. But the genius of the Brâh
manical tradition was its ability to embrace what could be embraced and push
aside the rest. Yogis and munis were brought into the Brâhmanical tradition as
ascetics by having them affirm the Vedas as authoritative (s ́ruti) and allowing
the disciplines of yoga to be interpreted as internalized Vedic sacrifices. A sys
tem of caste and stages of life (varna-as ́rama-dharma) became obligatory for all.
Those who had become liberated from rebirth while still in the flesh (jivan
muktas) were the only ones who were not subject to this system.
Thus, the renunciation of all social ties (samnyâsa, sannyâsa) by the
renouncer (samnyâsin, sannyâsi) was paradoxically made the fourth stage of
Brâhmanical society. It was a brilliant way of both legitimating the activities and
lives of the renunciates and marginalizing them politically. All that was impor
tant was left in place: priests would still be the intermediaries in public rituals
and in temple worship, the caste system would remain just as it was, and asce
tics would serve as models of giving up everything but the bare essentials for sur
vival. Any attempt on the part of the samnyâsins to acquire wealth, property, or
even worldly power would be self-refuting.
Samnyâsis were homeless, dead to the world and worldly obligations. Tech
nically, only brâhmins (some sources said the three upper classes) were eligible
to renounce worldly obligations—and only after they had completed the earlier
stages of student, householder, and forest dweller. A grown son would thus be
left as head of the household and the one responsible for the annual rituals (sam
skâras) to tend the ancestor spirits (pitris).

SAMSÂRA
A concept
Samsâra has the essential meaning of the cycle of rebirths or simply rebirth.
Samsâra is one of the key concepts in understanding the reason Hindu mythol
ogy can be so complex—figures changing genders from one lifetime to the
next, rebirths in lifetimes with different names but carrying from a previous
lifetime the results of actions not then completed, and teams of characters
being reborn in new relationships or even in reversals of roles from previous
lifetimes.
Rebirth was not a notion found in the early Vedic myths. There was a Vedic
idea of redeath (punar mrityu). Eventually redeath became rebirth (punar
avritti): the idea became prevalent that something would return to another life.
But what returned and with how much memory of previous existences was the
very essence of later mythology.

SAÑJAYA
A sage and minister of King Dhritarâshthra
In the Bhagavad Gîtâ Sañjaya is one of its four characters—the other being
Arjuna, Krishna, and King Dhritarâshthra. The idea of boon-granting (vara) had
become so common by the time of the late epic literature that a sage like Vyâsa
254 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Sandstone figure of Câmundâ, the fierce, protective eight-armed mother, from Orissa,

can give someone, Sañjaya, the power (siddhi) of clairvoyance and clairaudience
(distance sight and hearing). This power was called the divine eye (divya-drishti).
Through this power, Sañjaya was able to give blind King Dhritarâshthra a full
account of what was happening on the plains of Kurukshetra in the great Bharata
war. He even narrated the entire Bhagavad Gîtâ, with its conversation between
Krishna and Arjuna, to the king as that conversation was happening miles away.

SAPTA-MÂTRÎS, SAPTA-MÂTRIKÂS
Seven mothers
The collective name of the seven divine mothers—seven (saptan) mothers
(mâtrîs or mâtrikâs)—has been associated with S ́iva both in mythology and
iconography. The Brâhmanical view in the Mahâbhârata depicted them as
destructive female energies responsible for ill fortune and disease and especially
attracted to harming children. The mothers were assimilated into both the S ́iva
myth cycle and that of Devî, the Great Mother. Aspects of the mothers are
appropriated by Kâlî and Durgâ, while Câmundî (or Câmundâ) simply became a
dangerous manifestation of Devî.
In the episode of the demon Andhaka coming to Kailâsa to steal Pârvatî,
S ́iva wounded him with an arrow, but from the squirting blood arose thousands
of secondary Andhakas. So, S ́iva created a S ́aktî named Yôgêshvarî, while the
other gods created the seven mâtrîs, named Brahmânî, Vaishnavî, Mâhesvarî,
Kaumârî, Vârâhî, Indrânî, and Câmundî. The Varâha Purâna stated that there
are eight Mâtrikâs—counting Yôgêshvarî in the group. It stated that they were
personifications of evil (in the form of desire, anger, covetousness, pride, illu
sion, fault-finding, gossip, and envy). In the Kûrma Purâna S ́iva sent Bhairava
(his own fierce energy or his son) and the Mâtrikâs to hell (Pâtâla).
Iconographically, the sapta-mâtrikâs appear at the base of many important
S ́aivite cave and temple sculptures—such as Ellora, Belur, and Kumbhakonam.

The collective name of the seven divine serpents
The Sapta-Nâgas were Ananta, Takshâka, Karka, Padma, Mahâpadma, Sank
haka, and Gulika. Iconographically, they all wear the sacred thread of a brâhmin,
have an extended hood, and may have multiple heads.

SAPTA-RISHIS
The collective name of the seven most important sages
There were seven Sages (sapta-rishis) at the beginning of the era, the current
manvantara. The sapta-rishis were Marîci, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasishtha,
Pulaha, and Kratu.
There are other lists of the seven sages, such as Vasishtha, Atri, Kas ́yapa,
Vis ́vâmitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, and Bharadvâja. They were the witnesses of
the many creations. They were the ones who heard the eternal Vedas and vouch
for their integrity in every age. The seven are also called the mahârishis, the
great sages.
However, the difference between lists has led some Hindu authorities to say
that the sapta-rishis may vary from manvantara to manvantara.
In one myth the sapta-rishis were rescued by Vishnu in his fish incarnation (as
Matsya) along with the Vedas so they would help in the renewal of the universe.

SARASVATÎ
A goddess
Sarasvatî is a goddess of primary importance. She is accepted by Hindus as the
goddess of learning, the arts, and scholarship. However, Sarasvatî’s nature is far
more complex and her mythology more interesting than is widely known.
Sarasvatî, whose name means “flowing” and “watery,” has been associated
with an ancient river that was quite important in the Vedic period but eventu
ally dried up because of a desertification that was occurring in the region. Dur
ing the early Vedic period Sarasvatî was associated with Agni, as one of the three
flames of his fiery tongue (along with Ilâ and Bharatî) or as his wife. In the mul
tiple traditions reflected in the earliest Vedic hymns, Sarasvatî next became the
partner of Indra and then the As ́vins, the twin physicians of the devas (gods).
Sarasvatî healed with her purifying waters, and her banks were particularly
sacred for the Brâhmanical animal sacrifices of that period. Ram and ewe were
her favorite offering. In a time of intertribal warfare she granted absolution from
the worst of Aryan crimes, brâhmanicide (brahma-hatyâ).
From the earliest hymns Sarasvatî was associated with knowledge and
learning, and in the Yayurveda she was identified with Vâc, goddess of sacred
sound. In the Brâhmanas Sarasvatî had become the wife of Brahmâ, at a time
when his cult was the strongest—before Buddhists and Jains made Brahmâ the
chief target of their anti-Vedic, anti-deva message. But Sarasvatî survived
these attacks, even finding a place of honor in these heterodox and heteroprax
traditions.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 257



Sarasvatî, goddess of music, literature, and learning, was wife of Brahmâ but increased
in popularity and importance. (TRIP)



In the Purânas Sarasvatî was made the daughter of Brahmâ, being born from
his face, and charged him either with lust or incest in his desire of her. Brahmâ
grew heads in each direction because he could not keep his eyes off Sarasvatî.
When Brahmâ was totally discredited, Sarasvatî became the spouse of Vishnu
or for most Hindus, a goddess without a husband, worshipped separately, clad in
white and sitting on a white lotus—and on the tip of the tongue of students and
scholars who worshipped her. Her vina (lute), a manuscript, a white lotus, and a
rosary or a water vessel adorned her hands. At her side was her vehicle (vahana),
a swan (hamsa) or (rarely) a ram.
In the Mahâbhârata Sarasvatî had a son named Sarasvata, whom she kept
alive during a twelve-year drought by feeding him her fish. He had the strength
to keep the Vedas alive when other brâhmins became too weak to remember
them.
Several Purânas described the constant quarreling of the three wives of
Vishnu: Sarasvatî, Lakshmî, and Gangâ. Finally Vishnu gave two away—Saras
vatî to Brahmâ and Gangâ to S ́iva.
Currently, Sarasvatî is especially celebrated on the ninth day of the Navara
tri festival (also called Durgâ Puja) with rice and barley offerings. Invocations to
her call her by several other names: Gayatrî and Sâvitrî.

S ́ÂSTRAS
A set of law codes
The S ́âstras (precepts, rules) are a class of texts that cover religion as well as law,
medicine, and the (pre-) science of that period. They were classified as tradition
(smriti), ranking below the Vedas in sacredness. They have some mythological
material, but it is their insight into the context of duty (dharma) according to
the goals (vargas), stages of life (as ́ramas), and castes (varnas) that constitute
their great value for mythology.
Before the S ́âstras there were three, rather than four, life goals, expressed as
the three goals of life (trivargas): social responsibility (dharma), material respon
sibility (artha), and responsible pleasure (kâma). As such, these three goals of life
represented Brâhmanical ideals and together constituted the summum bonum of
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 259



Aryan culture. Only after Buddhist and Jain asceticism were ingeniously accom
modated by a fourth goal, liberation (moksha), and a fourth stage of life, renun
ciation (samnyâsa), was the life-affirming ethic of Brâhmanism altered and made
inclusive of ascetic ideals. And that is the situation reflected in the S ́âstras.
The most important of the law codes (Dharma S ́âstras) for Hindu mythol
ogy were the “Laws of Manu” (Mânava Dharma Shâstra). They described ritual
duties (samskâras), as well as the four goals (catur-vargas) and the four castes
(catur-varnas). The Kâma Sutra of Vatsyayana, also considered a S ́âstra,
revealed how responsible pleasure was taught to the wealthy citizen (nagaraka)
and how life was to be lived to its fullest. The acquisition of power and wealth,
along with the experience of maximum pleasure, was thought to be compatible
with earning heaven (svarga)—a point of view reflected in so many nonascetic
myths.

SATAKARNI
See MANDAKARNI
SATÎ
(1) A concept; a practice
Satî literally meant “good one,” or, since it had a feminine ending, “good
woman.” It was extended to mean “pure one,” especially a wife who had puri
fied herself in the funeral pyre of their husband. By the modern era satî (suttee
in nineteenth-century literature) came to mean “widow burning” (which
reformers like Rammohan Roy called “widow murder”). A number of myths pre
sented satî as a natural response of the wife to the death of her husband. Such a
death would be in conflict with prohibitions of suicide in the law codes.
Whether or not these matter-of-fact accounts of wives leaping into their hus
bands’ funeral pyres were a glorification of the practice of satî in the mythology
is open to question, as well as whether or not one gained heaven (svarga) or

achieved liberation (moksha) through
the practice. The aged parents of
S ́ravana jumped into their son’s
funeral pyre: but there was no judg
ment as to whether or not that could
be called a satî for both or either of
them. There are a number of temples
where satî used to be performed in
Rajasthan.

(2) The wife of S ́iva
Satî (goddess of purity, or faithfulness)
was the daughter of Daksha (god of rit
ual skill), one of the âdityas. When
Satî came of age, Daksha organized a
svayamvâra in order for Satî to choose
her own husband. All of the gods were
invited except S ́iva. As she circled the
gods, Satî thought only of S ́iva. And as
she placed the garland that indicated her choice of a husband, S ́iva manifested
with the garland around his neck. Daksha had to accept S ́iva as his son-in-law.
Later S ́iva showed Daksha no respect, when Daksha entered the hall and S ́iva did
not rise. Their enmity grew.
The culmination came when Daksha invited all the gods except S ́iva to a
sacrificial feast. S ́iva told Satî that he was not bothered by the slight. But Satî
went to her father’s celebration and ended her life in protest of her father’s rejec
tion of S ́iva. One version stated that she burned herself in the heat (tapas) of her
own yoga. Another had her committing suicide in the Brâhmanical fire pit so
sacred to orthoprax Vedic religion. (Although later myths used her act as an
example of satî in the sense of widow burning, she was not a widow throwing
herself upon the funeral pyre of her deceased husband.) For a different ending, see
the entry on S ́iva.
S ́iva was so upset that he picked up her corpse and danced with her on his
shoulders. The dancing was about to destroy the universe. Therefore Vishnu
hacked up Satî’s body with throws of his discus. The number of pieces that fell
to the earth varies—5, 51, 52, 72, 108—in any case, each piece became a tîrtha
(a place of pilgrimage). A thousand places claimed to be where one of her parts
fell, and each had one or more parts preserved in its temple. Kâmarupa in Assam

claimed that her most private part, her yoni, fell there, so Satî is worshipped
there in her yoni form. The Daksha Mahâdeva temple in Hardwar claims to be
the site of the sacrifice (yajñâ).

SATYAVÂTÎ
Mother of the sage Vyâsa
Satyavâtî was the mother of the great sage Vyâsa. However, her story is quite
interesting, as well as complicated because of all the nested elements. She was
born of a fish who had been cursed, given to a king but returned because of her
smell, named three times, and impregnated by a sage, who gave her a famous
child but returned her virginity.
Satyavâtî’s mother was a nymph (devastrî) named Adrikâ who had been
turned into a fish by the curse of a brâhmin. One day the semen of King
Uparicaravasu happened to fall in the river Gangâ, and Adrikâ swallowed it. She
became pregnant. Later she was caught by a fisherman who found two human
babies in the stomach of the fish, a boy and a girl. The two babies were presented
to King Uparicaravasu. He accepted the son, but gave the girl child back to the
fisherman because of her smell. That smell earned her the name Matsyagandhî
(the one who smells like a fish). The fisherman brought up the girl as his daugh
ter, giving her the name Kâlî (“black [girl]”), because she was so dark.
One day the fisherman was ferrying a sage across the Gangâ, when the brâh
min became attracted to Matsyagandhî (Kâlî). He created an artificial fog, made
love to her, changed her smell to musk, and instantly a son was born. He blessed
her so that she was still a virgin. The brâhmin Parâshara left immediately. Kâlî
raised her son as Krishna (“dark [boy]”), as he was also dark. Later he received
the name Vyâsa. Vyâsa went to the forest to practice austerities (tapas) soon
after his birth.
262 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Another day a king was hunting beside the Gangâ and caught the wonderful
scent of musk. He found its source inside the fisherman’s cottage and made this
fisherwoman his second wife, renamed Satyavâtî. She bore him two sons. King
S ́antanu’s first son, Bhîshma, chose celibacy. One of Satyavâtî’s sons died in
infancy and the other, Vicitravîrya only lived long enough to marry. But he too
died, leaving his wives, Ambikâ and Ambâlikâ, without children and the king
dom with an heir. Satyavâtî arranged for her earlier son, Vyâsa, to provide the
kingdom with an heir. (For further details see Ambikâ.) Ambâlikâ gave birth to
Pandu, and Ambikâ gave birth to Dhritarâshthra. Pandu had five divine sons,
while the other had one hundred sons who were their enemies in the Mahâb
hârata war. When Pandu died, his grandmother Satyavâtî retreated to the forest
with Ambikâ and Ambâlikâ. There the three women practiced austerities
(tapas) and devotion (bhakti) and attained heaven (svarga).

SÂVITRÎ
(1) Holy verse in the Vedas; (2) Wife of Satyavân
The Sâvitrî is also called the Gâyatrî. It is recited each morning and evening by
millions of Hindus. The Sâvitrî is addressed to Sâvitrî (the generator) who in the
earliest Vedic lore may have been one of the attributes of the great sun god,
Sûrya. The Sâvitrî was also personified in the later Vedas as the goddess Sâvitrî,
wife of Brahmâ, and mother of the Vedas. Sâvitrî was a princess, born to King
As ́vapati of Madra and his wife Mâlati. When Sâvitrî reached the right age for
marriage, she and the ministers of her father set out in search of the right person
to marry. She found Satyavân, the son of King Dyumatsena of Salva. Sâvitrî fell
in love with him and married him. Satyavân was a gem of a person. Their life
seemed perfect. Nârada, the sage with all the bad news, appeared and told Sâvitrî
and her father that Satyavân would live only one more year.
Sâvitrî was grief-stricken to hear this news. However, she continued to live
with Satyavân and loved him deeply. At the end of one year, Yama, the god of
death, came to take the spirit of Satyavân. Sâvitrî begged Yama for her husband’s
life. Her request was denied. Yama took Satyavân’s life. Because of the power of
her fidelity, Sâvitrî was able to follow Yama to Yamaloka (the realm of death).
Yama tried to dissuade her, but she was determined to return with her husband
alive or lose her own life. Yama could not take Sâvitrî’s life, since her time had
not yet arrived. Finally, Yama had to yield to Sâvitrî’s wish and give back
Satyavân’s life. Satyavân and Sâvitrî lived for a long time thereafter.

SIDDHI, SIDDHIS
A concept
Siddhi is a central concept of Hindu mythology; the term means “power” or
“supernatural ability.” The siddhis, often listed as eight, could be acquired by
austerities (tapas).
These supernatural abilities included the ability to obtain anything (prâpti),
having an irresistible will (prâkâmya), the ability to subdue anything to one’s
own will (vashitva), and having a sweet mouth (madhupratîka). Invisibility, the
ability to walk through barriers, teleportation, clairvoyance, and clairaudience
also appear in the myths.
There are terms that were used in the myths that link the person who
acquired powers by austerities with magic: for example, mâyâvî and tapasvinî
(both meaning roughly “magician”). The practice to acquire magical powers was
called siddha-sâdhana (discipline). The logic of ritual and private magic is dis
cussed in chapter 1.

S ́IKHANDÎ
A daughter born to King Drupada, an ally of the Kauravas
S ́ikhandî’s story had its beginning in another life. Wrongs done in that life car
ried into the next, with a vow to kill the warrior who had wronged her. In that
previous birth she was Ambâ, the eldest daughter of the King of Kâshî. She was
engaged to marry King Salva, when she and her two sisters, Ambikâ and Amba
likâ, were abducted by Bhîshma. The three sisters were to be given to Bhîshma’s
timid half-brother, King Vicitarvîrya. Ambâ objected and was returned to Kâshî.
However, King Salva had no desire to marry one whose chastity could be ques
tioned. Humiliated, Ambâ went to Hastinapura and demanded that Bhîshma
marry her. Bhîshma refused, saying that he had taken a lifelong vow of celibacy.
Ruined, Ambâ went to the forest to do austerities (tapas) in order to get
revenge. She received a boon to be reborn as S ́ikhandî in order to kill Bhîshma.
Because of his own austerities and his asceticism as a brahmachâri,
Bhîshma was almost invulnerable as a warrior. S ́ikhandî either fought in disguise
as a man or, according to one version, was a hermaphrodite warrior. In the final
battle with Bhîshma, S ́ikhandî was the material cause of his death. As ́vatthâma,
one of the Kaurava warriors, killed her in turn.

S ́IS ́UPÂLA
S ́is ́upâla was the third rebirth of Jâya for his failure to carry out his duty
(dharma) as a doorkeeper (dvârapâlâka) of Lord Vishnu at Vaikuntha. He was
cursed because of that failure, and he played a role in three incarnations of
Vishnu. His twin brother Vijâya shared in the original deed and caused an equal
amount of trouble.
The first two rebirths of Jâya were as Hiranyakas ́ipu and Râvana. Finally,
as S ́is ́upâla he received the grace of Krishna. S ́is ́upâla was a ks ́atriya, born to
King Damaghosha and Queen Cedi. He was a little unusual as a baby, having
three eyes and four hands, and braying like an ass. When the parents attempted
to abandon him, a disembodied voice predicted that his third eye and extra
hands would fall off as soon as he sat in the lap of the person who would kill
him. The king kept putting him in every great warrior’s lap, until in the lap of
his uncle Krishna it happened as predicted. S ́is ́upâla grew into an enemy wor
thy of a divine opponent, since Krishna had carried away Rukminî, his intended
bride. Finally, Krishna did kill him at Yudhishthira’s great horse sacrifice at the
end of the Mahâbhârata war. Because he had spent so many lifetimes focused
single-mindedly in his hatred on Vishnu, S ́is ́upâla was absorbed into the grace
of the Supreme. Thus, the cycle of rebirths was finally ended, and the grace of
Vishnu was finally granted.

SÎTÂ
A wife of S ́rî Râma; an incarnation of the goddess Lakshmî
Sîtâ was born from the earth when it was ploughed. Thus the earth, Bhû Devî,
was her mother. Sîtâ was brought up by King Janaka as his daughter. According
to many Purânas, Sîtâ was the incarnation of Lakshmî, wife of Vishnu.
Râma wed Sîtâ after winning the marriage contest—lifting and shooting an
arrow from the divine bow of S ́iva. Sîtâ was a devoted wife and always followed
the footsteps and words of Râma. In spite of his warning, she even followed
Râma to the forest when he was banished.
One version of the many adventures in the forest includes the temptation of
Râma by a râkshasa princess named S ́urpanakhâ. But when Râma shunned her,
saying that he only loved Sîtâ, S ́urpanakhâ attempted to kill Sîtâ. Laxmana, who
had joined his brother in exile, defended Sîtâ and cut off S ́urpanakhâ’s nose and
ears. She vowed revenge and went back to her brother in Lanka, King Râvana. He
in turn vowed to abduct Sîtâ to punish Râma. With the help of his uncle Marîci,
who changed his shape into a golden deer and led Râma away from his cottage
in the forest, Râvana successfully abducted Sîtâ. Here is how it happened: one
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 265



day in the forest Sîtâ happened to see a golden deer. She had an intense desire to
touch the deer, and she asked Râma to catch it for her. The golden deer was
Marîci, the uncle of Râvana, disguised, for râkshasas were shape-shifters. Râma
chased the deer for Sîtâ, but it lured him far away. Râma finally understood that
this was a trick. He shot an arrow, but while the deer was dying, it cried out in
the voice of Râma, calling for the help of Lakshmana. Sîtâ followed Lakshmana
in search of Râma. At that moment Râvana appeared, disguised as a sage, and
abducted Sîtâ. Râvana, the great demon king, flew away with her to Lanka in his
flying machine, called the Pushpaka-vimâna (“flower vehicle,” first owned by
the god Kubera).
The Râmâyana tells of the heroic deeds of Râma and his allies as they tried
to rescue Sîtâ. But the rescue took a very long time, while Sîtâ was forced to
undergo many trials, her endurance of which made her the example of the per
fect wife. Sîtâ was finally rescued from Lanka by Râma with the help of Hanu
man and others. Râvana—the demon of many rebirths, starting with Jâya—was
killed by S ́rî Râma.
Some versions have Sîtâ returning as queen to a life of luxury and happiness.
But others tell a tale of sorrow and agony. Râma banished Sîtâ to the forest in
deference to the people of his country. The people of Ayodhyâ questioned Sîtâ’s
chastity, as she lived in Lanka with the evil demon for so long. Meanwhile, Sîtâ
gave birth to two sons, Lava and Kusa, at the as ́rama (hermitage) of Vâlmîki,
who looked after her and raised the boys. Râma finally met his sons, who could
not be defeated by his army, and brought them and their mother Sîtâ back to the
palace. But again, Sîtâ was put to tests to prove her chastity to the people of Ayo
dhyâ. This time she did not wait for the verdict of Râma. She committed suicide,
or sati. Some versions have her mother, the earth, opening and taking Sîtâ back
into her abode.
Râma did not live very long after Sîtâ’s death. He drowned himself in the
river Sarayu. (It could be said that he went through water purification to heaven.)
Râma and Sîtâ returned to Vaikuntha and were rejoined as Vishnu and Lakshmî.
Sîtâ was famous as one of the five ideal women (pañcakanayâ) in Hindu
mythology. Her story is a story of sacrifice and sorrow endured in order to help
her husband keep both her dharma (ordained duty) and his.

S ́IVA
A god; the Supreme Lord of the universe
If the mention of the word S ́iva (auspicious) in the Vedas is considered to refer
to Lord S ́iva, S ́iva spans all periods of Hindu mythology. No matter when he
enters Hindu mythology, S ́iva is among the two or three most important gods
either as one of the later Hindu Triad, as the highest of the many gods (devas),
or as the Absolute itself (Brahman).
One might think of layer upon layer of stories about S ́iva. Viewed from the
present, the mythologies are intertwined and very complex. If each layer is
viewed separately within the period of its development, there were different ver
sions of the same story—some seeming to contradict the others.
S ́iva not only had an independent mythology but also influenced the evolu
tionary patterns of the minor gods of later myths. S ́iva was the father of two sig
nificant minor gods named Ganes ́a and Skanda, or Kârtikeya. The influence of
Ganes ́a was reflected in the life of any Hindu in the regard for this deity as the
remover of all obstacles.
In early Vedic texts mighty Rudra, the wrathful one and a god of storms, was
referred to as S ́iva, the auspicious one. However, in the next period S ́iva appeared
in the Epics as a god of supreme status, probably elevated from tribal origins.
Then in the later Purânic texts he was given the popular epithet Mahes ́vara
S ́ankara-S ́iva—the first element meaning “the great god” and the second and
third meaning “the auspicious one.” The transformation from the Vedic Rudra
and Purusha to the Purânic S ́iva (and later to the Tântric Bhairava) might also
indicate the merging of early myths into the later S ́aivite traditions, demon
strating the process of religious institutionalization of mythology. Finally the
S ́iva Purâna attributed all the three cosmic functions of creation, preservation,
and destruction to the three forms of Sadâ-S ́iva (the always auspicious one).
That replaced the post-Vedic version of the Hindu Triad (in which S ́iva was the
destroyer of that which was created by Brahmâ and preserved by Vishnu) with a
S ́iva who was the Absolute. Since, as it is told in the Kûrma Purâna, he was the
lord of destruction and began and ended creation, he was also the master of
death, Mrityunjaya, and time, Mahâkâla. There were also myths in Mârkandeya
Purâna propounding the nature of S ́iva as exceeding the powers of Yama, the god
of death. S ́iva stood distinct among the Hindu gods for his complex and yet par
adoxically unique features. He was an ascetic and detached from the attractions
of life, yet at the same time the only god symbolically represented with sexual
imagery. Though he was an ascetic he was worshipped (all over India) symboli
cally in the form of the linga (phallus), which was a sign of the ordinary life of
householders and of procreation. What was interesting was that sexual imagery
itself was used in order to transcend the innuendoes of the same—by its very use
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 267



S ́iva as Mahâyogi is the master ascetic. (TRIP)



the imagery became nonsexual. Through worshipping the linga one went beyond
the ordinary experiences of procreation. (Scattered over the map of India are
twelve temples dedicated to the worship of the jyotirlingâs, “fire lingas,” the
consecrated symbolic image of S ́iva in the form of the phallus.) This interesting
feature of the symbolism of a supreme god like S ́iva was justified, according to
the many variants of a myth about a curse from the sage Brighu upon S ́iva: S ́iva
would be the only god not worshipped by his face.
S ́iva was the master of dance, and the only one of the gods who could plunge
into motionless yogic tapas (ascetic practices) and meditation. Though he him
self was a resident of the graveyard (smasâna vâsi) and the lord of ghosts and
goblins, he was the bestower of wealth and prosperity (S ́ankara).
As the king or lord of dance (Natarâja), S ́iva perfected dance, relating power
(tândava natana) and grace (lasya natana) manifested through the physical
body and affecting the cosmic body of the universe. Symbolically, S ́iva as
Natarâja represented the intricate process of causation and the profound philo
sophical ideas associated with it. The ash-smeared, ferocious, and angry S ́iva
danced alone in the graveyard, burning down all that was created. His tândava
natana marked the destruction and return of what had been created to an orig
inal state of equilibrium. A story connected with the tândava of S ́iva was that
of the Daksha yâga, of Sati’s jumping into the fire altar, after being humiliated
by her father Daksha. S ́iva danced in the most ferocious way and destroyed the
entire setting of the yâga (sacrifice). He himself, not able to bear the throes of
the pain he felt over his wife’s ending her life, ended the manifested universe to
find solitude.
While the tândava dance of S ́iva was always associated with his dancing
alone in the absence of his female counterpart, the lasya natana was of more aes
thetic significance. It involved the gentle moods of S ́iva and Parvati, his wife (or
second wife in some accounts). The lasya natana of the divine couple was
depicted in popular iconography as the ardha narîs ́vara or half male (right side),
half female (left side). This was the dance of peace, love, and creation. Both tân
dava and lasya constitiuted the cosmic dance of S ́iva.
S ́iva was not only the king of dance and abode of auspiciousness (S ́ivam)
that resulted in the epitome of that which was beautiful (sundaram) but also the
origin of truth (satyam). He was the one god who encompassed the three seem
ingly contradictory planes of truth: beauty and wisdom and power. Therefore,
one saw him as the great ascetic, the great dancer, and the great Yogi.
S ́iva was the first teacher of humankind, according to one myth, told in the
Dakshina murti Stotra. He presented the wisdom of immortality to mortals. He
took the form of a young teacher facing northwards, the Dakshina murti (one
who faces north). And, quite appropriately, the mode of teaching was silence.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 269



Another notable feature throughout the development of myths about S ́iva
was his third eye and its nature. S ́iva was the god of yogic powers. S ́iva granted
the light of wisdom through his third eye or turned the object of his wrath into
ashes by the fire emanating from it. From the stories about his third eye came
the popular epithets of Kshiraprasâdi (one who is compassionate to bless) and
Kshiprakopi (one who is wrathful). He was worshipped on the day of S ́ivarâtri by
the panchâkshari mantra S ́iva, the five-syllable mantra aum namah S ́ivaya, and
by the thousand and eight epithets describing his glories.
Iconographically, the linga was the most universal symbol of S ́iva as the gen
erative principle of the universe. However, there were numerous forms of S ́iva
that the artist captured to reflect the contrasting features of the mythology.
Temples to S ́iva were often located at places celebrated in the scriptures or
by local myths and legends. For example, the Elephanta cave temples carry out
an extraordinary mythic program, telling of S ́iva and Parvati’s lîlâ (love play) in
a cosmic game of dice symbolizing the creation and involution of time and
space, causality, life and death, age after age.

SKANDA
Son of S ́iva and god of war
Skanda was the six-headed son of S ́iva, god of war. Skanda can be seen as either
sharing his function with Kârttikeya, Guha, Kurmâra, and Subrahmanya or as
absorbing them as epithets. S ́iva’s son had been the son of Agni, god of fire, in
earlier mythology. In the Mahâbhârata there were several versions of Agni’s
paternity of Skanda. In one account of the story of Agni and the frog damsel,
Agni had been hiding in the ocean and finally agreed to father Skanda. In another
version Agni as the sacrificial fire warmed the wives of the Seven Sages (sapta
rishis) and managed to get six of them pregnant. (For more details see the entries
on Krittikâs, Kârttikeya, and Subrahmanya.) In the standard version Agni’s role

was appropriated by S ́iva; it was
his sperm that impregnated the
sage’s wives, having first gone
into the sacrificial fire. In both
cases, the son is the six-headed
warrior. His names preserve
some of the main aspect of his
mythology: Skanda (fall [of
S ́iva’s seed]), Kârttikeya (son of
the Krittikâs, the Pleiades),
Guha (reared in a secret place),
Kurmâra (youth), and Subrah
manya (“favorable to priests”).

SOMA
(1) A deva (god); (2) a plant and
the Vedic drink made from it; (3)
the moon
This entry will focus on Soma as
the plant and Vedic drink. For
more information about Soma as
a deva and as the moon, see the
entry on Candra. In the Vedic period Candra, the moon, and Soma, the
entheogenic (religious experience–inducing) plant, were connected by associa
tions (bandhus) in the early hymns.
Mythologically, Soma emerged from the Milky Ocean in a pot, a process
made possible by the Kûrma incarnation of Vishnu and Vishnu’s shape and gen
der shifting as Môhinî. Soma was the drink or nectar of immortality (amrita),
fought over by gods and demons, but eventually brought from heaven by an eagle
(syena), later said to have been Garuda (vehicle of the god Sûrya).
Ritually, soma was at the very center of Vedic ceremonies, offering suste
nance and energy to the devas and ecstasy to brâhmins. The bird delivering
soma was associated with the gâyatrî, Vedic religion’s most sacred mantra, the
verse with three eight-syllable padas (feet). Some hymns gave the impression
that soma was purchased from a rustic dealer who was paid and ceremonially

war (TRIP)



driven away, reenacting the primor
dial combat between gods and
demons or the conflict of the demons
with the later guardians of soma, the
gandhârvas.
Soma and Agni were linked in
this cult of ecstasy. Soma was “king,”
and Agni took Soma to the devas.
Often the hymns referred to them as
combined or symbolically united.
Soma was not fermented or dis
tilled. Priests pressed or extracted
soma by pressing stalks between
stones into a wooden bowl. They used
wool to filter the juice and may have
mixed it with clarified butter (ghee).
The most famous soma rituals were
the consecration of the king (Raja
suya), the horse sacrifice (as ́va
medha), the “drink of power” ritual
(Vajapeya), and various fire rituals
(Agnistoma). The gods had come to
depend on earthly priests to pour soma into the ritual fire and on Agni to bring
their shares to heaven (svarga). Buddhists ridiculed this belief, saying that if they
believed that Agni could take something to heaven, they should jump into the
fire themselves.
Many scholars think that the real soma could not be easily obtained in the
lower altitudes and hot climate away from the Himâlayas, and a few centuries
before the time of the Buddha soma was only a memory in the rituals. Conse
quently, the priests’ ritual ability and the rituals themselves became all important.
The belief in the power of ritual (mâyâ) rose, along with the belief in the power of
austerities (tapas).
There were several psychedelic, hallucinogenic, or entheogenic cults in the
ancient world, many associated with divine mushrooms: Avestan haoma, Greek
ambrosia and nectar, Chinese ling-chih, a mushroom of immortality. Soma is
viewed as such an entheogenic or psychedelic, principally on the work of Was
son and O’Flaherty. It is not universally accepted that soma was the mushroom
fly agaric since this mushroom could only be found at 4,000 feet above sea level
or higher. However, this very fact would account for its scarcity and finally its
loss.

Soma, an ancient solar deity (the moon) and the
drink of immortality, possibly from the pressings
of a poisonous mushroom (TRIP)



Certainly at its peak soma was central to Vedic rituals, as many hymns in
the Rigveda and the entire Samaveda dedicated to it attest.

SUBRAHMANYA
Son of S ́iva
Subrahmanya means literally “favorable to priests,” often used as an invocation
to the devas (gods) in Vedic soma sacrifices. Subrahmanya was also the designa
tion for one of three assistants to the Vedic Udgâtri priest. However, this beau
tiful Sanskrit compound was simply appropriated in the Purânas to name S ́iva’s
most frightening creation, a son born to destroy a demon before he was a week
old. The story of Agni’s rape of the wives of the sages was also appropriated but
reconstructed in such a confusing way that they were not Subrahmanya’s moth
ers but merely his nurses.
The need for such a warrior son is accounted for in a story that began back
at the beginning of this kalpa, when Vajrânga’s wife had been abused by Indra
and Brahmâ. Vajrânga did the necessary austerities to gain a boon to allow his
son to avenge this abuse, a son more powerful than Indra and not to be killed by
anyone more than a week old. Târaka, the asura (demon), was that son, devel
oping into a conqueror of the three worlds.
The devas pleaded with S ́iva to solve the problem. So he and his favorite
wife Pârvatî began making love to produce a son to take care of the problem. But
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 273



their thousand-year play (lîlâ) began to shake the foundations of the universe.
The devas, including the goddess Bhîmî (earth), begged them to quit. S ́iva
stopped immediately, but then lost his seed onto the earth, overflowing forests
and mountains. Bhîmî complained, and the gods had Agni consume the seed
with his fire. Pârvatî became angry and cursed Bhîmî for causing her not to get
a son by S ́iva. The curse was that Bhîmî would have many forms, be a wife to
many, and not enjoy the happiness of having children. (For details about other
versions of this myth, see the entries on Skanda and Kârttikeya.)
S ́iva’s semen was carried to the Gangâ and then deposited on the Udaya
mountain in the Shara grass. Thus, Subrahmanya was born and began crying.
The six Krittikâs or divine stars, formerly the six wives who had been raped by
Agni, descended to the crying infant. When he saw them, Subrahmanya devel
oped six heads so that he could be breast-fed by each one of them. S ́iva came and
crowned his enormous infant the commander-in-chief of his forces. Finally,
before he was more than a week old, he led his army against the armies of
Târaka-asura, Mahisha, Bâna who was the son of Mahâbali, and numerous other
great demons. Subrahmanya killed the otherwise unkillable Târaka-asura, and
other demons were killed as well.
Another story was told to give the reason that Subrahmanya took the vow
of celibacy. Pârvatî loved her new child so much that she petted him con
stantly. So Subrahmanya became obsessed with his desire for physical pleas
ures. He became a menace to all the goddess in heaven, raping them at will.
Finally, Pârvatî called Subrahmanya and gave an image of herself to him, telling
him to see every woman as his divine mother. Thus, Subrahmanya was able to
become celibate.

S ́UDDHI
A concept
The concept of purification (s ́uddhi) is linked to pollution (mala) and the ways
it is removed: ritually, physically, or even by divine grace. Central to the Vedic
sacrifices was the notion that blood sacrifices would atone for wrong-doing and
remove a form of purification called agnis ́uddhi. S ́iva was not invited to Dak
sha’s fire ritual, and that snub implied he was impure. S ́iva’s impurity may have
been by birth—his very caste status (varna) was questioned by the Brâhmanical
tradition, according to which S ́iva was a tribal or Dravidian deity and thus suf
fered caste pollution. A myth about pollution from touch told of how Can
drasharman, a brâhmin, had killed his teacher, yet he was still worried about
further pollution from touching or eating with sinners who were lower caste. If
274 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



he broke caste rules (varna-dharma), it involved more karmic demerits (apunya)
and the possibility of a bad rebirth.
Many went on pilgrimages (yatras) to sacred sites or “river crossings”
(tîrthas) in order to fulfill vows (varas) to remove various kinds of pollution.
Other methods for removing pollution were the reciting of chants (mantrayâna)
and worship (puja). Purification has remained a central concern in the mythol
ogy and in everyday life of modern Hindus.

S ́UKRA
Master of magic, teacher of the asuras (demons)
In the Epics S ́ukra was the son or grandson of Bhrigu, the powerful magician who
almost killed Agni. S ́ukra was also known as Kâvya. S ́ukra became the greatest mas
ter of magic of his age, but he served the asuras. The devas (gods) sent sage Kaca to
learn how he had made the asuras invincible. (For more details see the main entry
on Kaca.) Devayânî was S ́ukra’s daughter and had a prominent role in that story.
The Purânas made S ́ukra an example of sensual excess. S ́ukra constantly
used up his austerities (tapas) and the powers (siddhis) he had acquired by his
tapas, plunging into years of abandoned living. It began when he was a boy. His
father Bhrigu went into deep meditation (nirvikalpa-samâdhi) for a thousand
years. S ́ukra became bored and with the power of his mind followed the lovely
apsara (celestial maiden) Vishvâcî into Indraloka, Indra’s heaven. Several other
celestial maidens were showing him around when he discovered Vishvâcî. They
immediately fell in love. S ́ukra made the whole place dark, so that the maidens
left Vishvâcî and him alone. They made love for eight fourfold yugas (catur
yugas). Finally, he had used up all his virtue (tapas) and fell from heaven. His
shriveled-up soul eventually took rebirth as a brâhmin’s son, and during that life
he was a muni (ascetic, magician). But again he used up his tapas when he fell
in love with a doe (who was really a cursed apsara) and had a son by her. He for
got his practices and his religious duties and died of snakebite. So it went life
time after lifetime—some austerities and then yielding to carnal temptations.
Finally, Bhrigu awoke from his meditation. His dead son’s emaciated body
lay beside him. Yama told him what had happened through all of his son’s
rebirths while Bhrigu was practicing his own tapas. Yama decided to bring S ́ukra
back to life as Bhrigu’s son.
S ́ukra became the preceptor of the asuras, instructing them in austerities
and rituals to keep them strong. He had some run-ins with S ́iva—some negative,
some positive. Once he stole Kubera’s wealth, S ́iva swallowed him. In S ́iva’s
fiery belly, S ́ukra worshipped S ́iva and was discharged. Later, he worshipped S ́iva
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 275



more earnestly and was given the mantra for restoring life (mritasañjîvanî
mantra). It was this knowledge that the devas sent Kaca to learn and bring back
to them. Kaca seduced his guru’s daughter but succeeded in his mission.
In his old age S ́ukra observed the third stage of life (vânaprastha, forest
dweller) and attained heaven (svarga).

SÛRYA
The sun god
Sûrya was a primary deity of the Aryans at the time of the earliest hymns of the
Rigveda. The solar cult saw the sun as the most obvious symbol of life, con
sciousness, and divinity. For some time within each of the first three periods of
Hindu mythology, Sûrya was acknowledged as the creator, the principle of life,
the Supreme, or supreme ruler of all. Afterwards Sûrya underwent the process so
familiar in Hindu mythology—appropriation of his powers and attributes by other
deities, subordination to other deities, and finally attacks on his very character.
In the Cândogya Upanishad Sûrya was at the threshold between the
unmanifest spheres above that were self-born (svayambhû) and those below that
were manifest. Elsewhere Sûrya was praised as creator, self-born, and both man
ifest and unmanifest. As late as the Mahâbhârata Sûrya was the gateway to the
way of the gods (devayâna). Some Purânas said that Sûrya was the cause of all,
worthy of praise, and the supreme light, and that Sûrya dwells in humans and
humans in Sûrya.
All this praise was not just poetic license. The worship of Sûrya as the
Supreme had some support until the middle ages, and even then a small reawak
ening took place in the attempted building of the Sun Temple at Konarak—a
temple that was not completed or consecrated because of the Muslim conquest
of one of the last kingdoms in north India.
Despite this worship, stories that show Sûrya in a subordinate position or
his qualities assimilated by other deities better reflect mainstream Hindu
mythology. Sûrya was also known by names such as Âditya (and when he
became one of twelve sons of Kas ́yâpa and Aditi, Sûrya was an âditya), Vivasvân,
Sâvitrî, and Savitur. He joined solar deities who were now personified as
demigods of the Purânic pantheon. He acquired a golden chariot with one wheel
(making the chariot orbit the sky) drawn by seven horses. (The Konarak temple
must have showed his chariot with twelve wheels for the twelve months before
it was destroyed.) His charioteer was Aruna, whose brother Garuda, the sun
eagle, was most often his vehicle (vahana). (For more details, see the entries on
Aruna and Garuda.) The Purânas gave him two, four, or at the most seven wives.
276 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



His principle (Purânic) wife was Samjñâ (knowledge); the others were Châyâ
(shade), Prabhâ (light), Râjñî (queen), Savarnâ (colors), Svâti (self-being), and
Mahâvîrya (great courage). His children suggest his complete fall from
supremacy and loss of divine character: three from Samjñâ (Manu, Yama, and
Yamunâ or Yamî) plus the As ́vins when he and his wife mated as horses, three
from Châyâ, three from his other divine wives—and, if Ushas is taken as his
daughter, incest with her—and liaisons with mortal women and animals, father
ing at least Karna, dark warrior of the Mahâbhârata, and Sugrîva, the monkey
king. The 108 names of Sûrya had long been forgotten by the time of the Purâ
nas—the ones that, if remembered, brought entrance through his gate to heaven.
Sûrya was henceforth seen in Buddhist, Jain, Shaiva, and Vaishnava iconography
bowing with upraised hands in praise of some being truly wise or supreme, who
was depicted as his superior, from whom he needed knowledge or grace.
His last roles in the Purânic myths were as the food of Râhu (swallowed
with each solar eclipse), the one too busy to fight Râvana, and the giver of a boon
here and there. The Gâyatrî mantra that is still chanted to the rising sun
remains as an artifact of Sûrya’s once great place in Hindu mythology.

TAKSHÂKA
A mighty serpent
The grandfather of this kalpa, Kas ́yapa-prajâpati, founded the kingdom of ser
pents with his wife Kadrû. Takshâka was one of her seven greatest children, the
septa-nâgas. Takshâka and her most righteous children were cursed to be reborn
on earth and to be burned alive as their punishment for not obeying their
mother.
The story goes like this: Kadrû had become involved in a wager with another
wife of Kas ́yapa, Vinatâ. They bet on the color of the tail of the divine horse
Uccaishshravas, each wagering her own service to the other. In order to win,
Kadrû commanded her snake children to hang on the tail of the horse to make it
black. Takshâka refused to support this deceit, was cursed, and became the
leader of the good serpents on earth.
However, life on earth and power seemed to bring arrogance. Takshâka was
central in the myth of the biting death of King Parîkshit. And the story contin
ued with Parîkshit’s son Janamejaya holding a snake sacrifice (sarpasatra) to rid
the earth of serpents, especially Takshâka. However, Takshâka hid beside the
creator Brahmâ. The high priest Uttanka, who was presiding at the sacrifice,
searched for the king of snakes psychically and saw Takshâka beside Brahmâ.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 277



The priest was furious and decided to bring Brahmâ and his throne along with
Takshâka into the fire. The magic worked so well that that they were all pulled
down from heaven and were within moments of being consumed in the flames.
Exactly at that instance the brâhmin Âstîka arrived and was paid full respect by
King Janamejaya. That included offering to fulfill any wish that Âstîka might
have. Âstîka asked for an immediate end to the sarpasatra, and Janamejaya kept
his word to the brâhmin and ended the sacrifice.
Takshâka was not always a danger to kings. He saved King Candrângada
from drowning and hosted him in his watery kingdom. Takshâka on occasion
helped Brahmâ or Indra, but just as often found his interest at odds with that of
a god or hero—for example, when he crossed Arjuna and Arjuna killed Tak
shâka’s favorite wife.
Takshâka’s watery kingdom seemed to overlap with Pâtâla (hell) in some of
the Purânic myths. Takshâka was there to welcome Balabhadra-Râma (Bala
râma) when he died and reached Pâtâla.

TÂLADHVAJA
A king and the husband of a sage
The story of Tâladhvaja was retold to solve a variety of problems—above all,
how a sage could remain an ascetic when he had changed genders to marry a
king. The solution in the Devî Purâna was a kind of popular use of Advaitan phi
losophy in a myth: using a popular understanding that life is mâyâ, an illusion
or dream. King Tâladhvaja’s story was nested in one about the sage who made
the most appearances in other people’s stories—the great sage Nârada.
In order for Nârada to experience the relative value of attachments in life,
Vishnu gave him the experience of a lifetime as a householder—better yet, as
a mother. Vishnu asked Nârada to take a bath, so Nârada left his lute (vina)
and deerskin robe on the shore. When he emerged from the river, he had
become Saubhâgyasundarî, a lovely young woman. It so happened that King
Tâladhvaja arrived at just that moment and engaged Saubhâgyasundarî in con
versation and then in marriage. He took her back to his palace, and after
twelve years of honeymooning, she began to give him children. Years passed,
and Saubhâgyasundarî was the matriarch of a huge family of children and
grandchildren. However, war broke out with an adjoining kingdom. King
Tâladhvaja was defeated and fled the battlefield. Saubhâgyasundarî arrived
there to find all of her sons and grandsons slain. As she wept, Vishnu appeared
and instructed her in the meaning of life. Finally, Vishnu asked Saubhâgya
278 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



sundarî to bathe in the river. And when she emerged from the river, she had
become the old sage Nârada again.
Meanwhile, King Tâladhvaja had arrived to see his wife go into the river for
a bath and suddenly become an old sage. Tâladhvaja could not be consoled by
Nârada. Vishnu appeared and told Tâladhvaja that human attachments are only
an illusion (mâyâ). So Tâladhvaja gave up his kingdom, practiced austerities, and
attained liberation (moksha).
The ending allowed two interpretations: a relatively real experience
(visishita-advaita) of Nârada as the wife of Tâladhvaja or an illusory one
(mâyâvâda). This ending thus illustrates one of the strengths of mythology—it
does not have to be fully rationalized or be made philosophically perfect.

TANTRA, TANTRISM
A religious sect or practice
Tantra has had many meanings: a class of literature (the Tantras), practices that
are non-Vedic (tantrika), one of the religious sects of Hinduism. There is no sin
gle word in Sanskrit for Tantrism as a religious perspective, even though its addi
tions to the Hindu tradition make it quite distinctive. Tantrism can be seen in
the point of view of Hindu mythology. It is a practical path, with techniques for
acquiring magical or supernatural powers (siddhis). It is the entire cosmos as
unified; there is no absolute division between pure and impure. What an ortho
dox Hindu would find polluting, the Tantrika would use as an avenue for purifi
cation or, more likely, to develop siddhis. The five Ms (pañca-makâras), so
called because each began with m—madya (wine), matsya (fish), mâmsa (meat),
mudrâ (an aphrodisiac), maithuna (sexual union)—were used to develop siddhis,
the Tantrika hoping eventually to gain liberation (moksha) by these very prac
tices. Physical pleasure (kâma, maithuna) could lead to happiness (bhukti,
ânanda) in this world and the next, and one could even become free in this life
time (jîvanmukti). This whole practice was based upon energy (s ́haktî) that was
pure or could be purified.
The Tantrika lived in a unified world in which anything could be done
because everything was divine or could be made divine. The Tantrika was armed
with prayers (mantras), rituals, gestures (mudras), symbols (yantras), postures
(asanas), divinities, and even demons for protection and for growth. In fact, the
frightening deities and demons were something in which the Tantrika special
ized. Transforming the dark into light, the polluted into the pure, was at the
heart of their practice. This approach was almost always controversial and sup
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 279



posed to be secret—only discussed among the initiated with a master. It was a
path of small groups, not a mass movement.
The main divisions of Tantrism were along the same line as sectarianism
Hinduism: Vaishnava, S ́aiva, and S ́âkta. There were also worshippers of the sun
or Sûrya (Sauras) and Ganes ́a (Ganapatyas) who were also Tantrikas. Further dis
tinctions were made as to the three currents (srotas)—right (dakshina), left
(vama), and accepted (siddanta).

TAPA
A god with five fathers
Tapa was a deva (god) who was born of the tapas (austerities) of five sages:
Kas ́yâpa, Vasishtha, Prânaka, Cyavana, and Trivarcas. Hence, he was also
known by the name Pâñca-janya (one born of five). He can be said to be the per
sonification of tapas. However, the Mahâbhârata added that Tapa had his own
sons: Purandara, Ushman, Prajâpati Manu, Shambhu, and Âvasathya—all
obscure enough. To these sons were added the five urjaskaras, five sons of sac
rifice, and the his final son—Parishrânta, the exhausted sun. Tapa’s mother was
not mentioned.

TAPAS
A concept
Tapas, a central term in Hindu mythology, literally means “heat.” It served as a
metaphor for the heat generated in ascetic and esoteric practices. Austerities
that generated tapas, often themselves called tapas, were not always ascetic in
spirit. Most myths link tapas with powers (siddhis): one practiced tapas in order
to gain siddhis. The demons (asuras) often quit any aspect of their practice that
was ascetic (fasting, yoga, meditation, worship) as soon as they acquired the sid
dhi they sought (immortality, invincibility, and the like). Often Brahmâ, and
sometimes Indra or other devas, granted a boon (vara) for a particular power (sid
dhi) as a reward for a particular form of austerity (tapas). In this latter concep
280 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



tion tapas was analogous to Vedic sacrifice, providing the devas with something
they wanted so that they would grant a human desire. Besides siddhis, these
desires could even include the reward of heaven (svarga). Myths about the way
the asuras would practice tapas that flattered Brahmâ suggested that repeating a
chant (mantra) of praise (japa) for a thousand years either pleased Brahmâ or
obligated him to grant the desired boon. When tapas was equated with purifica
tion rituals, it was linked to the notion of penance. However, stories of people
becoming purified by penance in order to have the siddhi to make war with
invincibility only emphasize the connection of tapas to magic (mâyâ).

TÂRÂ
One of the five perfect women
The story of Târâ illustrates the Purânic mentality of defaming its heroes and
heroines, since some accounts make her a willing participant in adultery and
others exonerate her and present her as one of the pañcakanayâ, five perfect
women.
Târâ was married to the great sage Brihaspati and was unusually beautiful.
Consequently Târâ was abducted by Soma (or Candra, the moon), and that
resulted in a war known as Târaka-maya. Rudra and the demons (asuras) were
on one side with Soma, and Brihaspati and the gods (devas), led by Indra, were
on the other. Brahmâ finally restored Târâ to her husband. However, she was
with child. Both Soma and Brihaspati claimed the child, who was named Budha
(the planet Mercury). Finally, Târâ said that the child was fathered by Soma.

TILOTTAMÂ
An apsara
Tilottamâ was an example of robotics, according to the modern Hindu idea that
every form of knowledge, including modern science, can be found in the Vedas
and Purânas. Tilottamâ had to be made from all the elements of beauty, animate
and inanimate, to make a woman who would enchant two demons (asuras).
Tilottamâ was put together by the divine architect, Vis ́vakarman. Brahmâ had
made his usual mistake and granted invincibility to the asuras Sunda and Upa
sunda. They needed to be tricked into fighting each other, as that was the only
loophole in the boon. Therefore, Brahmâ instructed Vis ́vakarman to make Tilot
tamâ. Before she went to earth she worshipped the devas (gods) by the custom of
circling them (circumambulation, or pradakshuna). S ́iva was so enamored by
Tilottamâ that he created a face on each side of his head so that he could always
see her. And Indra instantly produced a thousand eyes for the same purpose.
Sunda and Upasunda had conquered the three worlds and sent the devas
away in terror, but now they met their match. They both fell in love with Tilot
tamâ and fought to the death for her, killing each other. However, the story does
not end there. The Padma Purâna corrected the Mahâbhârata’s story of the cre
ation of Tilottamâ by Vis ́vakarman. It told the story that an ugly widow named
Kubjâ spent eight years doing auspicious ceremonies that culminated in a purifi
cation bath (Mâgha pûjâ). Kubjâ was reborn as Tilottamâ. Her austerities led to
the return of the proper order in heaven.

TÎRTHA-YATRA
A practice
A yatra was a pilgrimage, or visit, to a river crossing, or ford (tîrtha). Thus the
term tîrtha-yatra came into usage. Over the centuries it came to mean a visit to
any holy place, a pilgrimage to a sacred region (such as the plain where the
Mahâbhârata battle was fought), to a temple city (such as Melkote), or to a river
(such as the Gangâ or the Yamunâ).
Some have seen in the practice the influence of Dravidian or Indus Valley
ritualistic bathing and a continuation of early purification practices. However,
there may be something more interesting. Vedic literature mentioned Brâhman
ical rituals (Agni yagas) being performed at river fords (tîrthas) wherever Aryan
culture had become dominant in an area. Add to that the need for large amounts
of water when warriors were killed to perform their death rituals, as in the myth
of King Asamañjasa’s sons: they were killed, but no rituals could be done for lack
of water. King Bhagîratha was able to get S ́iva to bring the heavenly Gangâ to
282 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



earth, and the death rituals were finally done. Combine the clues, and the fords
may well have marked battle sites and the places where the sacred ashes of war
riors rested, showing how Aryan culture had been spread and lands pacified.
A full-blown cult of pilgrimage was already in evidence in the Mahâbhârata.
Surinder M. Bhardwaj’s classic study of pilgrimage sites (tîrthas) showed a clock
wise journey, starting at Pushkara in Rajasthan, and then visiting ancient
Mahakala (Ujjain), Dwaravati (Dwarkar), Kurukshetra, Varanasi, Gaya, and so
on, hoping to end at Prayaga (Allahabad). The literary references to boatmen
have meaning when there are great rivers to cross and no bridges. Two kinds of
stories about the sacred guided the pilgrim—those of local significance and those
of a pan-cultural nature. It was Bhardwaj’s thesis that pilgrimage defined an
Aryan consciousness. It circumscribed those areas where the fire rituals were
done, where vows could be fulfilled, where worship to Brâhmanical deities could
be done.
Tîrtha-yatra was one way of acquiring merit (punya). It was another type of
austerity. It was an inexpensive substitute for Brâhmanical sacrifices. But the
routes traced carefully by Bhardwaj showed no interest in land that had not been
sanctified by Aryan conquest. Vast regions were not visited. Where there was no
myth about a divine activity, there was no interest in a journey into that region.
By the modern period tîrthas are classified in a number of ways: mythically
(divine, demonic, sagely, human), religious (sectarian or pan-Hindu), cultural
(regional or pan-Indian), liturgical (water for purification or temples for worship),
geographic (battle sites, forests, mountains), and so on.
Myth and pilgrimage are linked in the most fundamental ways: myth
locates where the pilgrim can experience the sacred. Modern Hindus choose
from 1,800 tîrthas to nurture religious needs and longings. However, there is an
innovation of visiting the four corners of India: Badrinath in the north nestled in
the Himâlayas, Puri in the east, Ramesvaram in the south, and Dvarka in the
west. There seems always to be the desire to go to Benares (Varanasi) and return
home with sacred water from the Gangâ. Finally, pilgrimage is further encour
aged by festivals and fairs so rich in number and variety that they alone could
possibly keep the myths alive. Each place has its special myths, festivals, and
observances. And all of this activity of visiting sacred sites (tîrthas) is believed
to gain merit, a better rebirth, and eventually liberation.

TRITA
A deva (god)
Trita was a Vedic god whose name meant “the third.” His main importance
comes from sharing the same achievements with Indra. Some scholars say that
he was Indra’s double, but a more likely interpretation is that Trita was already
fading from prominence by the time of the Vedic hymns. That is, Trita repre
sented an earlier mythology. He was known in the earliest Avestan (Persian)
mythology. Indra was given Trita’s heroic deeds: the slaying of the monsters Vri
tra, Vala, and Vis ́varûpa, son of Tvashthri.
One story in the Rigveda told how Ekata (first), Dvita (second), and Trita
(third) went to draw water. The two threw Trita in the well and sealed it with a
wheel. Trita composed a hymn (Rigveda 9.34.4) and prepared a soma sacrifice
(yâga) in the well. (It may be a type of Cain and Abel story of brother[s]’s envy
and attempted murder, but it is only a fragment.)

TVASHTHRI
God of craftsmanship
Tvashthri, literally the shaper, was the son of Kas ́yapa and Aditi. Alain Daniélou
called him the personification of one of the six minor principles of Vedic culture:
craftsmanship. The hymns in the Rigveda made him function something like
later concepts such as s ́aktî (divine energy) and life force (prâna), except that
Tvashthri was the very divine craftsman at work in the womb, forming the off
spring of all species, determining their beauty and strength. By the time of the
Brâhmanas Tvashthri had become the agent in crafting into being whatever was
manifested. He made Indra’s mighty thunderbolt (vajra) from the bone of the
sage Dadhîci. However, his son Vis ́varûpa was a rival of Indra, and some
accounts said that Indra killed him.
Some versions maintained that there were two different Tvashthris: one the
divine craftsman and another an âditya (celestial god).

UPANISHAD
A scripture from the last of the four divisions of the Vedas
The meaning of upanishad is “to sit near attentively.” They usually consisted of
a metaphysical discussion between the sage and a disciple. There are 108 Upan
ishads traditionally, although only a dozen, the so-called major Upanishads, are
in every list. Minor Upanishads are still being written.
In the early Vedic period, before the Upanishads were recognized as author
itative, there was a three-fold division of the Vedas: the Samhita (collection of
hymns), Brâhmanas (commentaries), and Âranyakas (forest texts). The Upan
ishads formed the last (anta) part of the Vedas, also called Vedânta (from veda
and anta).
The Vedas were the earliest Indian scripture and have always had the great
est authority. However, that does not mean that if a story or a figure is not men
tioned in the Vedas, it is considered untrue or without authority. In fact, there
were a number of ways of resolving such a problem. First, it could be said to be
additional revelation and therefore compatible. Or, it could be new (that is, not
mentioned in the Vedas) and a necessary supplement, given the declining spir
ituality of each of the four yugas. New revelations were needed for the kali
yuga, the one we are in now. Many more ways were available to allow for dis
crepancies and even contradictions to the Vedas in later Purânic and Tântric
mythology.
One major Upanishad, the Isha, presented a woman sage teaching the devas
(gods) about the Absolute (Brahman). Some of the important Upanishads are the
Taittirîya Upanishad, Mândukya Upanishad, and the Brihadâranyaka Upan
ishad. The Brihadâranyaka Upanishad is the longest Upanishad. The Upan
ishads are known as one of the foundational pillars (prasthânatreya, “three
pillars”) of Indian thought. Because of their deeply philosophical and medita
tional approach, the Upanishads provide few myths—and only several names of
sages with some ideals like union (samadhi) with the Absolute (Brahman).

URVAS ́Î
An apsara (celestial nymph)
Urvas ́î’s story is unusual. She was an apsara, but instead of being born or created
in heaven she was born from the thigh of a mortal. She resulted from a conflict
between Indra and her father, the sage Nârâyana. It happened in this way.
Nârâyana and Nara, sons of Dharma and grandsons of Brahmâ, were heating up
the throne of Indra with their powerful austerities (tapas). Indra tried three ways
to stop their acquisition of power: boons, fear of his show of power, and the
temptation of his celestial beauties. The first two had absolutely no effect, but
possibly because of spring the sages opened their eyes to see all the famous
apsaras from Menakâ to Ghritâcî and 10,080 maidservants. To teach Indra a les
son, Nârâyana slapped his thigh (ûru), and from it was born “the one born of a
thigh” (urvas ́î). She was first in beauty of all the apsaras. Other beautiful women
were also created, and all given to Indra. He apologized to the sages and left with
his celestials as well as the new gifts. Once in Indra’s heaven, Urvas ́î became
eleventh among the singers and dancers.
Later, either Brahmâ (in the Devî Bhâgavata) or Mitrâvarunas (in the Bhâ
gavata Purâna) cursed Urvas ́î to be born on earth. Urvas ́î had heard of a hand
some king named Purûravas, found him, fell in love, and married but with three
conditions. Even with all his other beauties Indra soon missed Urvas ́î and sent
his gandharvas to bring her back. Somehow they knew that she had promised to
stay with King Purûravas only if he tended her two lambs, let her eat only ghee
(clarified butter, food of the gods), and did not allow her to see him nude. So the
gandharvas waited until they were at play in the bedroom. They stole the lambs,
and when the king jumped from the bed to save them, the gandharvas lit the sky
with a bolt of lightning. King Purûravas was caught without any clothes. He
raced after the lambs and soon found them. However, when he returned, Urvas ́î
had left. Purûravas wasted away searching for his lovely Urvas ́î. Years later he
found her at Kurukshetra, site of many a pilgrimage. Her famous words are com
mitted to memory by every Indian schoolchild in their vernacular, or better yet
in Sanskrit: “Women are like wolves. Don’t have an alliance with them, O King!
Kings should not put their faith in women and thieves.” (Of course, this was not
quite the way the great medieval poet Kâlidâsa described their story in his
Vikramorvasî, one of the great love poems and dramas of India. But that is
another story.)

USHÂ
Daughter of Bânâsura and wife of Aniruddha
Ushâ was a daitya (demon) princess, daughter of Bâna and granddaughter of Bali,
both great asura (demon) rulers. Ushâ dreamed of the man she would wish to
marry. Citralekhâ, a woman with this special siddhi (power), drew a picture of
Aniruddha, grandson of Krishna, according to Ushâ’s dream. Then, Citralekhâ
brought Aniruddha to the palace with her magic. When Aniruddha was brought
to Ushâ’s room and saw his own picture, he fell in love with Ushâ.
Bâna or his preceptor immediately sensed Aniruddha’s presence and sent the
palace guards to kill him. Aniruddha was able to defeat them, but he was taken
prisoner by magic and bound in serpents with the help of S ́iva and Skanda, S ́iva’s
son and god of war.
Krishna and Aniruddha’s father, Pradyumna, rescued him, bringing both
Aniruddha and his bride Ushâ back to their palace in Dvârakâ.
This little story has great popular appeal. One even finds it alluded to or
added as a scene within modern Indian films or video serials.
See also Citralekhâ
USHAS
A goddess
In Vedic mythology Ushas was the goddess of dawn and the herald of all that was
connected with the advent of the sun, Sûrya, supreme ruler of the heavens.
She announced Sûrya, who brought along with her, light to make the pas
tures fertile, horses, chariots, wealth, and plenitude. The mighty sun god seemed
unapproachable to the Vedic worshipper because of his formidable luminance;
Sûrya could not be directly viewed by ordinary mortal eyes. Ushas was approach
able in the light of early morning devotion and would lead mortals to the all
powerful sun god. Bringing forth Sûrya, she was invoked as the eye of the gods
(Rigveda 7.77.3: devânâm chakshuh . . . vahanti).
She was ever the young woman and the immortal divine one who bestowed
material wealth upon the Aryans. She was described as the mother of plenitude
(Rigveda 7.77.2: gavâm mâta), beautiful and ever young, yet also the one who
ages humankind. The cool rays of Ushas, the beautiful mother, had the power to
direct and channel the mighty powers of the sun god.
Even in the Vedic hymns her lineage was traced back to two different ori
gins. The first made her the daughter of a somewhat obscure sky god named
Diva (also called Vivasvân). This lineage seemed to be the most common in the
hymns to her and made her the sister of the solar deities known as the âdityas
(Rigveda 7.77.6), including the mighty Varuna.
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 287



However, the second lineage involved a complex problem in Vedic mythol
ogy: the mode of creation. According to it, Ushas was said to be the daughter of
Prajâpati, father of all beings. He represented a monotheistic direction in later
Vedic mythology, where he rivaled the Vedic Triad of Sûrya, Indra, and Agni,
rulers of the three realms. A careful reading of the hymns revealed that he cre
ated Ushas in an unspecified way, perhaps by word or division of himself, but
not with a mate—for he, Prajâpati, was the origin of everything. He then mated
with her, and she became the mother of all things. Some scholars miss the
unique solution of the Vedic poets in this myth. It need not be written off as
incest; it can be seen as a mythopoeic solution for creation, in which a feminine
solar deity was the mother of creation. Yet, in the second lineage she was still
referred to as the sister of the âdityas, showing an inability on the part of the
poets to fully draw out the implications of her relationship to the âdityas—since
they had become her children.
Ushas was related to other female goddesses and gods in the Vedic period like
Vâc (goddess of speech), Prâna (god of breath), and Manâh (goddess of mind). Ushas
was the bestower of material wealth in all its forms. Even though she was immor
tal, she did not give immortality to mortals. There seemed to be a developing reli
gious or spiritual hierarchy in her gifts of material prosperity and pleasure
contrasting with those of the later Vedic goddesses who gave higher knowledge,
power, and wisdom. Her gifts were this-worldly. Vâc, especially, prefigured a still
later goddess, Sarasvatî, who ruled the realm of knowledge of specific sciences and
arts—in fact, who was the repository of all conceivable knowledge.
Ushas is still significant in contemporary India. She is acknowledged and
worshipped through the Gâyatrî mantra, the spiritual armor of Hindu brâhmins
and brahmachâris (celibate individuals) throughout India. This mantra, used as
a morning (and often evening) devotion, has been recited by the most orthodox
for three thousands years.

VÂC
A goddess
Vâc means “word” and “song,” as well as being the name of an early Vedic god
dess. Vâc refers to both speech and speech-consciousness. Vâc enters into the
seers (rishis).
A Rigvedic hymn to Vâc stated that all actions and powers were grounded
in speech. It was the primordial energy out of which all existence originated and
in which it subsisted. At the same time it claimed that Vâc extended beyond the
288 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



heavens and the earth. This was an example of an associative process that the
hymnists were using what were called bandhus (links)—a logic that connected
processes with divinities.
Speech was recognized as the first expression of truth. The sage Dirghata
mas proclaimed, “From her [Vâc] flows the oceans; through her the four regions
exist; from her the ground [akshara] of the Veda flows; on her the entire uni
verse stands.” Then he stated that only the manifested forms of speech can be
known; the deepest levels remain hidden. He further added that prayer is the
highest heaven in which speech dwells. Through prayer—the fundamental mode
of speech-consciousness—the individual mind tried to resonate with the cosmic
mind in Vedic hymns.
The yâjña (sacrificial) performances were based on the psychology of
speech-consciousness. Through the liturgical, performative knowledge of sacri
ficial celebration, the limitations of ordinary existence and the grounding of
human existence in the more fundamental levels of consciousness were recog
nized and experienced.
In the Brâhmanas Vâc was equated with Sarasvatî, the goddess of wisdom
and the arts. In the Upanishads Vâc was created from the self (atman). However,
the tendency to pull down the gods and goddesses reigned in the Purânas, and
her reputation was besmirched. As Vâc-Sarasvatî, she was the mind-daughter of
Brahmâ. So the Matsya and S ́iva Purânas implicated her in the sin of incest with
her father, Brahmâ. Virâtrûpa Agni (Brahmâ’s son as half a male) mated with his
sister Vâc, and their offspring became the year.
In S ́aivite cosmology, S ́iva manifested the cosmos in five stages: joy
(ânanda), knowledge (vijñâna), thought (mana), life-breath (prâna), and physi
cal life (bhûta). Bhûta divided into speech (vâc) and food (anna). Thus, Vâc was
subordinated to S ́iva as the true creator, and speech became just one of the prin
ciples involved in the origin of the universe.

VADHRIMATÎ
A princess mentioned in the Rigveda
Princess Vadhrimatî was married to a hermaphrodite. With the blessings of the
As ́vin brothers she received a son named Hiranyahasta.
The story came from a time when gods had sons with princesses. In a
slightly different version Vadhrimatî was married to a eunuch. Despondent that
she could not have a child, Vadhrimatî prayed to the As ́vini-devas, the divine
twins, the physicians of the devas (gods); they happily fulfilled her desire.
Hiranyahasta grew up a sage, possibly even a brâhmin, since he married the

daughter of sage Matarisvan. Another version said he married a princess, the
daughter of King Madirâshva.

VAIKUNTHA
The abode of Vishnu
Vaikuntha was the celestial abode of Vishnu. Vaikuntha literally means the
“place of no hindrance.” In the Purânas, it was located variously—in heaven
(svarga), north of the heavenly mountains (Himâlaya), even on Mount Meru
(Mahâmeru), the axis of the earth. Most commonly Vaikuntha was located on
the southern slopes of Mahâmeru. It had streets of gold, buildings of jewels, and
was graced by the celestial Gangâ. For some sources it was identical with
Goloka, the heaven of Krishna.
See also Gangâ; Vishnu. For more on Hindu cosmology see chapter 1.
VAIVASVATA MANU
The Manu of the seventh Manvantara, the current age
Vaivasvata Manu is the “first man” of the current manvantara (age or era). In
the Rigveda there were references to Father Manu, implying that he was either
a creator or a progenitor of the human race, but this reference seemed to refer to
the sun god Sûrya. In the Satapatha Brahmana Manu was known as the first
human, father of the race, first to kindle the sacrificial fire, and creator of the
social order. There was also a story of Manu’s instruction by a fish (matsya) to
build a boat. The fish then helped Manu survive a great flood. When he was
saved, Manu gave thanks, and a woman, Idâ (or Ilâ), was created. With her as
mother Manu produced the human race.
The Epics traced all royal lineages to Manu. One of his sons, Vikukshi, founded
the solar race (sûrya-vamsa) of kings at Ayodhyâ. Purûravas, son of Manu’s daugh
ter Idâ, founded the lunar race (candra-vams ́a) of kings at Pratisthana.
The later Purânas tell of multiple Manus, a Manu, or first man, for each man
vantara. Manvantaras were approximately three hundred million years each, and
the present one is the seventh manvantara. The current Manu is Vaivasvata
Manu. The six previous Manus were Svayambhuva, Svarocisa, Auttami, Tamasa,
Raivata, and Cakshusa. There will be seven more: Savarni, Daksasavarni, Brah
masavarni, Dharmasavarni, Rudrasavarni, Raucya (or Devasavarni), and Bhautya
(or Indrasavarni). The Manus are discussed in chapter 2 in the section on mythic
time.

VÂLMÎKI
A very famous sage and the author of the Râmâyana
There are no authentic records about Vâlmîki’s parentage. The popular version
considered him to be the tenth son of Varuna, god of the sea.
Vâlmîki was considered to be the first poet. There is an interesting story
about the earlier part of Vâlmîki’s life. He began this life as a hunter named Rat
nâkra who looked after his family in the forest by hunting for animals—but also
by robbing travelers. One day he happened to see the saptarishis (seven sages),
who warned him about the consequences of his sins and predicted that no one
would share the consequences with him. This striking truth awakened Rat
nâkara. He went home and asked his wife whether she would share the conse
quences of his sins. His wife said that one enjoys the fruits of one’s own actions
and these cannot be shared with anybody. This revelation of the saptarishis
changed Ratnâkara.
When Ratnâkara met the saptarishis again, he began to chant the name of
Râma according to their advice. Many years went by as he practiced austerities
(tapas). The body of Ratnâkra was covered with termites. Finally, the saptarishis
came back on the same road. They called to Vâlmîki for him to come out of his
tapas. They named him Vâlmîki because he came out of a termite’s nest
(valmika).
Vâlmîki was living in his âsrama (hermitage) by the river Tâmasâ. One day
he saw a hunter who shot a bird from a tree with an arrow. It was one of a pair.
The surviving bird was flying around in agony. This tragic scene inspired
Vâlmîki to write his first verse.

VÂMANA
The fifth of the ten incarnations of Vishnu
Vâmana was the dwarf incarnation (avatâra) of Vishnu. The myth utilized the
device of deceit, or outwitting the opponent, even though the struggle was
between the supreme god Vishnu and a demon (asura) named Bali. Although an
avatâra was required to restore the proper order and return righteousness to the
world, Bali exhibited such high ethical qualities that some may be confused
about which party was the example of righteousness.
Bali (also known as Mahâbali) had obtained a boon (vara) of invincibility and
(conditional) immortality from Brahmâ, so he could not be conquered by the
gods (devas) unless he was cursed by his teacher (guru) S ́ukracharya. S ́ukra had
greater knowledge of the Vedas than the chief priest of the gods, his mastery of
magic was greater, and the austerities (tapas) performed by the asuras exceeded
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 291



those of the gods (devas). Thus, Bali was able to lead the asuras to victory after
victory over their rivals.
The devas, led by Indra (who in the myths from the Epic Period onwards was
weak and easily defeated by the demons because he did not properly keep the
rules of dharma), turned to Brahmâ. As always (in a Vishnu myth cycle), Brahmâ
the creator must send the gods to Vishnu, the Supreme. It was Vishnu who
decided whether there was a special need to end the time of disorder and restore
dharma. His goal during this time was to send King Bali to the netherworld
(pâtâla) and to help Indra regain his position as head of the devas and ruler of
heaven (svarga). However, Bâli was not a perfect villain and the myth had some
moral ambiguities that remained unsolved.
Vishnu incarnated as a brâhmin boy into the family of Aditi and her hus
band, the sage Kas ́yapa. In earlier myths, they were the cosmic parents of the
gods. Yet in this myth, it was Aditi’s tapas that allowed Vâmana to be born as
her son. As a dwarf (vâmana) brâhmin, he went to the court of Bali. Although
misshapen, he was still honored as a priest. His feet were washed by King Bali
before his court, and he was asked to name a request. Vâmana asked only for the
land that he could encompass in three steps. Bâli wished to be more generous
and asked Vâmana to name something more worthy. However, when Vâmana
kept asking for the same thing, the king’s sage S ́ukra guessed that this must be
Vishnu in disguise and warned his disciple, the king. King Bali had such a high
code of ethics that he would not withdraw the boon. And to the horror of all, the
dwarf grew into a giant whose three strides encompassed all of creation. His
teacher cursed Bali because he would not heed his teacher’s warning. Thus, the
very condition that would break Bali’s boon of invincibility was fulfilled.
Garuda, the cosmic eagle and now Vishnu’s vehicle (vâhana), swooped
down from the heavens, bound Bali, and took him for judgment to Vishnu. Some
versions even have his ancestor—Prahlâda, the asura hero of the Narasimha
avatâra—appearing to plead for Bali. In any case, Vishnu recognized the honor
and merit of Bali and granted him entry into his abode, a realm higher even than
the heaven of the gods.

VARÂHA
Third of the ten incarnations of Vishnu, as Varâha, the wild boar
In the Padma Purâna the world order had again been disrupted. The fierce asura
(demon) Hiranyâksha had gained a boon (vara) of invincibility. With his provi
sional immortality, he stormed around the three regions of the universe wanting
to fight and kill the gods. He became bored when he could do no more evil, so he

dragged Bhîmî-devî, the earth, to the bottom of the cosmic ocean. Svayambhuva
Manu and S ́atarupâ, the future parents of humanity, and the gods asked Brahmâ
what could be done. From his meditation a tiny boar was produced out of his
nose. The boar quickly grew to an enormous size and then dove into the depths
of the cosmic ocean. It was the ever troublesome Sage Nârada who revealed to
Hiranyâksha that Vishnu had left heaven. Although Hiranyâksha found Varâha,
his taunts could not start a fight. Varâha first brought Bhîmî to the surface and
restored the earth to its proper place. Then he turned to the task of delivering the
world from its current threat of evil, which was always the task of each avatâra
(incarnation). Varâha disposed of Hiranyâksha in a mighty battle.

VARNA
A concept
Varna means “color”; it refers to a ideal system of four classes or groupings of
society—the so-called caste system. Both these idealized classes and the current
jati (birth) system of several thousand endogamous groups are translated by the
word caste, which probably came into English from Portuguese. Surprisingly, the
real caste system of jati and its world of marriage and occupation laws are not
referenced in Hindu mythology. It is the ideal caste system of the four varnas
that is noticed: the brâhmana (brâhmins), the priests; the râjanya (ks ́atriyas), a
ruling or warrior group; the vais ́ya, artisans or merchants, and the s ́ûdra, ser
vants or workers.
In the modern era reformers Svâmî Vivekânanda (often called Father of
Renaissance Hinduism) and philosopher (and later president of India) S. Rad
hakrishnan talked about the ideal of interrelated support each group should give
to the others for their mutual uplift spiritually, socially, and culturally. This
type of support would explain how in the myths groups of persons were con
nected in their karma from one lifetime to the next as they jointly worked out
their spiritual lessons.
Hindu mythology may be looking at the ideal of varna from another per
spective. Many myths offer nonorthodox conceptions: ks ́atriyas changing to
brâhmins by their own austerities; brâhmins who are evil, who maim or kill
their enemies, who lie and deceive, who do not know the Vedas; all types of
intercaste marriage; and brâhmins who eat meat. Perhaps these departures from
the ideal reflect the very theme of the myths—that this age is the kali yuga,
when dharma has been forgotten, especially varna-dharma.

VARUNA
A god (deva)
Varuna was one of the oldest of the Vedic deities. Varuna may have been part of
the first triad of gods known in the Vedic period—along with Mitra and Arya
man. A little later but still within the early Vedic period, they were replaced by
Agni, Indra, and Sûrya.
Varuna was both an asura (demon) and a deva, leading to the notion that
Varuna, ancient lord of justice (rita) and truth (satya), had a violent streak.
There were accusations in the later myths that this violence was why Indra took
away Varuna’s power.
In the early Vedas Varuna was the king of the earth and the sky, and the cre
ator. He was also associated with Mitra, the ruler of the night—though in later
Vedic hymns we find him as the chief of the âdityas, thus an asura, and con
trasted to Mitra, a deva and a ruler of the day.
Later when Indra took over the rulership of heaven, Varuna became the god
of oceans, who rode on a makara, his fish or water monster vehicle. This phase
was especially elaborated in the Purânas. He was presented as the father of
Brahmâ, who created the whole world, and also of the sage Vasishtha, one of the
seven Rishis (sapta-rishis). Like the more famous god of death and justice, Yama,
one of the attributes of Varuna was a noose (nagapâsa) by which he tied the
guilty, a remembrance of his role of judge of the just and the unjust.

VÂSUKI
A mighty serpent, and the eldest son of Kadrû and Kasyapa
Vâsuki served as the churning rope when the wondrous objects, including the
nectar of immortality (amrita), were brought up from the Milky Ocean.

VÂYU
A deva (god)
Vâyu was the Vedic wind god.
He fought alongside Indra and
the Maruts (gods of storm) in
defeating Vritra, the storm
demon who held back the celes
tial waters. He was a charioteer
of enormous power. Vâyu would
be connected in the Upanishads
with breath of life (prâna). By
the time of the Purânas, how
ever, Vâyu was reduced to one of
the eight Dikpâlakas (guardians
of the directions) of the universe.

VEDAS
The Scripture
Veda means “knowledge,” but
specifically refers to the eternal
wisdom of the four collections of
hymns, sacrificial rituals, and
other sacred texts that are called
the Vedas. Along with the four
collections (the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Âranyakas, and the Upanishads),
two more bodies of literature, the Sutras and the Vedângas, are sometimes
included in the Vedas. The Vedas are said not to be composed by human hand
(apaurusheya). Tradition teaches that they have always existed, and myth
accounts for the preservation and reappearance of the Vedas after each dissolu
tion of the universe. The seven seers (sapta-rishis) in most accounts, the Manu
of the age (who might also be a mahârishi), or an avatâra (incarnation) like the
boar (Vâmana) incarnation of Vishnu makes sure that the inerrant Vedas come
into an age. But the myths show an anxiety about how they are preserved as an
evil time sets in, or when demons have stolen the Vedas and an avatâra is
required to restore them.
Even so, many believe that the Vedas contain all knowledge (veda) past and
future. All science has been discovered in some previous age, and there is evi
dence of the gods or demons using airplanes to cross the sky, as does Râvana
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 295

when he captures Sîtâ, and using missiles and nuclear weapons against each
other, as does Indra when he launches his vajra (divine weapon, formerly a light
ening bolt) or Râma his “arrows.”
The Aryans resisted all forms of writing for several millennia even after they
had come in contact with it, depending instead on their educational system and
memory techniques (pathas, vikritis). An oral scriptural tradition and its rever
ent transmission was believed to be more reliable than writing, because writing
could be altered, while a collective memory could not. The Vedas were therefore
known as s ́ruti, “that which is heard.” There were several schools (s ́akhas) and
subschools (caranas) that kept alive variations within the tradition.
Scholars have argued that internal examination of the Vedic corpus indi
cates a time when the Aryans knew of but had not yet migrated to what is now
northeastern Pakistan and northwestern India. They called this region Sap
tasindhu (the seven rivers’ land). They shared an ancestry with their pre-Avestan
cousins who later inhabited what is now Iran. The early part of the Vedic or
Samhita period (c. 1500–900 B.C.E.) appears to have been a time when the war
riors (ks ́atriyas) were highest in esteem and power and the priests (brâhmins)
were charismatic prayers and ritualists. The later Vedic period was a time of reli
gious transformation, with several triads of gods rising to and then losing
supremacy (the last triad of the period being Agni, Indra, and Sûrya), Varuna’s
rapid decline, the loss of the entheogen (“god-experience”–inducing plant) soma
from actual ritual use sometime before the end of the Brâhmana and Aranyâka
period (c. 900–c. 600 B.C.E.), and the rise of the godling (âditya) Vishnu and a non
Aryan god of the cremation ground, S ́iva, to supremacy over the Vedic pantheon.
(There are major entries on each of the aspects of Vedic religion.)
Within the Samhitas (collections) is a fourth section known as the Athar
vaveda that is quite unlike the rest in tone and content. The other three sections
were often referred to as the three (triyi) Vedas, excluding or assigning lesser
authority to the Atharvaveda. It was filled with magic, both positive and nega
tive, ranging from mantras and potions for fertility to death prayers. In fact the
notion of knowing brahman, in the sense of power, was what the Atharva
priests claimed, as over against the rituals and sacrifices of Vedic brâhmins.
They knew the power (brahman) and the magic (mâyâ) that could control both
gods and sacrifice. Although their practice does not come unaltered into later
periods, their influence on Hindu mythology and its practices to acquire magic
powers (siddhis) has not been fully accounted for. Their magical practices were
called the pañca (five) kalpas (sacred precepts).
The period when the Brâhmana and Âranyaka literature were created
closed with a priesthood that was asserting its primacy over the other castes
(varnas), confident that its “science” of sacrificial rituals and Vedic chanting
296 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



(mantrayâna) could control the universe and optimistic that it knew how to pre
pare Aryans for a life beyond the grave.
The Upanishadic literature was not included as part of the Vedic corpus for
centuries after its composition. Its outlook challenged the hereditary nature of
the Brahmanical priesthood, its sacrificial religion, its knowledge of that One by
which everything was known (Brahman), and its notion of the afterlife. Once
this challenge was integrated into a new worldview, the fourfold Vedas would
become authorative, orthodox, and orthopraxic for what would eventually be
come Hinduism. But many would maintain that Vedic authority was a symbol
and Hindu mythology of the Purânas was the reality.

VEDIC GODS
See Chart on Vedic Gods in Appendix
VISHNU
One of the three major gods of modern Hinduism
Vishnu rose from a minor role as a solar deity in the Rigveda to one of the Hindu
Triad with Brahmâ and S ́iva to the Absolute of the universe in Vaishnavism.
Vishnu’s willingness to incarnate in time of need to restore righteousness
(dharma) was the inspiring theme that made him both absolute and a compas
sionate giver of grace (prasâda).
Vishnu in the Rigveda was but a minor godling, whose solar activity of mov
ing through the three regions of the universe may well have been another’s func
tion. He was Indra’s friend and ally. When Indra slew the boar who stole the
property of the asuras (demons), Vishnu carried away the dead beast, leaving the
stolen property for the gods. Mentioned several times in the hymns of the
Rigveda, Vishnu’s role expanded rapidly in each succeeding age. In the Brah
manas Vishnu shared in the operation of the sacrificial ritual and appropriated a
role in the triad of Agni-Indra-Sûrya, joined by Brahmâ and S ́iva. By the Purânic
period, especially the Bhâgavata Purâna, Vishnu created the creator Brahmâ and
either used S ́iva or sent his own avatâras (incarnations) to function both as sav
iors and destroyers. (There are additional entries on some of the ten avatâras

Buddha, and Kalkin—and some of the manifestations.) Perhaps the most unusual
myth about Vishnu was his manifestation as Môhinî at the Churning of the
Ocean where Vishnu appears as a beautiful goddess to deceive the asuras
(demons) and allow the devas (gods) to acquire soma (the drink of immortality).
During the period before each re-creation of the universe Vishnu would rest
upon his serpent bed formed by Ananta (also known as S ́esha) on the Milky Ocean.
The abode of Vishnu was called Vaikuntha. Vishnu was always blessed with won
derful opponents—Bali, Hiranyâksha, Hiranyakas ́ipu, Râvana, and many others.
Each necessitated a manifestation of power or grace, and that was freely given.
Just as in the literature, among the pilgrimage sites (tîrthas) Vishnu’s sacred
geography appropriated almost all of the sites of Indra and Brahmâ, until no
other god, not even S ́iva, had more sites of worship.
Iconographically, Vishnu usually has four arms (although there could be
many more), a dark blue complexion, and royal headgear. In his hands are the
conch, discus, mace, and lotus. Upon his chest is the miraculous jewel called the
Kaustubha (treasure of the ocean) and a curl of hair known as S ́rî-vatsa (beloved
of S ́rî, or fortune). His vehicle is Garuda, the sun eagle, taken from Sûrya. His
wife (or wives) are S ́rî (fortune) and Lakshmî (thousands, or good fortune). Many
see her as one, S ́rî-Lakshmî, even when two images represent her presence.
There were other wives during his various incarnations, such as Bhîmî (earth)
and Rukminî, principal wife of Krishna.
Vishnu’s epithets demonstrate that his followers understand his many rev
elations as transcendent, as an incarnation (avatâra), as an emanation (vyuha)
like Vasudeva or Aniruddha, as divine immanence and inner ruler, and as an idol
for worship (murti).

VIS ́VAKARMAN, VIS ́VAKARMA
The celestial architect
Vis ́vakarman (omnificent) may originally have been an epithet for any powerful
god, but it was used in the Rigveda most often for Indra and Sûrya. There are two
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 299



Rigvedic hymns to Vis ́vakarman praising him as the all-seeing god, the one who
names the gods, and that one beyond the comprehension of mortals. He was said
to be the sacrifice and the one to whom the sacrifice is given. The Nirukta added
that Vis ́vakarma, son of Bhuvana, held a sarva-medha (total sacrifice) offering
something of everything and ending with himself.
In the Epics and Purânas this Vis ́vakarman was reduced in status and per
sonified as one with creative power, the heavenly architect. He could even be
called a Prajâpati, when the term came to refer to any creative being. Vis ́vakar
man was described as having the powers and the very office of Tvashthri, a ref
erence that is too vague to suggest anything more than the fearsome Tvashthri
has been reduced to an office. Vis ́vakarman became the great builder of celestial
palaces and kingdoms, as well as constructing the magical weapons of the gods.
The Râmâyana has him building Lanka for the demon Râvana and then gener
ating the ape Nala who builds the bridge to Lanka for Hanuman’s invasion of
Lanka.
Some Purânic accounts make Vis ́vakarman the son of the eighth Vasu
(attendants of Indra), Prabhâsa. Others say that Vis ́vakarman married Yogasid
dhâ, a wonderfully beautiful and virtuous woman, with whom he had a daugh
ter, Samjñâ. When Samjñâ found her husband, Sûrya, too bright and hot,
Vis ́vakarman put the sun on a lathe and trimmed away an eighth. From what fell
from his lathe Vis ́vakarman forged the discus of Vishnu and the trident of S ́iva
as well as weapons for the rest of the gods, including Kubera, god of wealth, and
Kârttikeya, god of war.
In the Vâmana Purâna Vis ́vakarma became the mean father who cursed his
beautiful daughter, Citrângadâ. He in turn was cursed by the sage Ritadhvaja to
be reborn a monkey. (The treatment of Vis ́vakarman [Vis ́vakarma] demonstrates
just how authoritative the Vedas are when Vedic gods are so easily reduced to
mean fathers.)

VIS ́VÂMITRA
A famous sage
Vis ́vâmitra was already important in the Rigveda as a sage and composer of many
hymns in book (mandala) three. However, his lineage shifted with the sources
so much that one later authority stated that he was the son of both King Kushika
and King Gâdhi. Vis ́vâmitra (universal friend) was able to raise himself from
ks ́atriya caste to brâhmin by his austerities (tapas). He was still, however, made
to submit to his brâhmin rival Vasishtha in later mythology to show the sub
mission of ks ́atriyas to brâhmins. This rivalry became so exaggerated in the later
300 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



literature that Vis ́vâmitra and Vasishtha were depicted as hating each other so
much as to murder each other’s sons and, according to one low moment in these
stories, eating each other’s sons. Such a portrayal ignored their status as mahâ
rishis (also sapta-rishis) in this current manvantara, the seventh cycle of cre
ation, and therefore models of Vedic virtues. The later mythmakers simply were
so prone to debase their subjects with sin and weakness that they lost sight of
how these figures had been portrayed in earlier periods.
In an Epic account Vis ́vâmitra became the object of the apsara (celestial
damsel) Menakâ’s seduction. Vis ́vâmitra had begun to accomplish too much in
his austerities and was a threat to Indra’s rule of heaven. So Indra sent Menakâ,
and she successfully diverted the sage from his tapas. They had a girl who was
later named S ́akuntalâ (one raised by the birds), after they abandoned her and
S ́akuntalâ was found and raised by the sage Kanva. The story of King
Dushyanta’s discovery of the young beauty S ́akuntalâ and his impregnating her
and abandoning her is found in her entry.
Vis ́vâmitra’s rivalry with the chief priest of King Harishcandra of Ayodhyâ
involved many episodes and prior causes. Vasishtha had counseled King Harish
candra to exile his son Satyavrata. However, the king repented this deed and
gave over his throne to Vasishtha while he practiced austerities. The kingdom
experienced a twelve-year drought during this time. Vis ́vâmitra had left his fam
ily to practice austerities, and they were starving. The young prince Satyavrata
took pity on them and provided them with fresh meat from his hunt each day.
One day there was no game so he killed Vasishtha’s cow. To make matters
worse, the cow was Kâmadhenu, the wish-granting cow given by the gods. When
Vasishtha learned what had happened, he turned Satyavrata into the shape of an
outcaste (candâla) and cursed him with the name Tris ́anku (three sins). When
his father King Dushyanta died, Tris ́anku became king, but asked to go bodily to
heaven. Vasishtha and Vis ́vâmitra fought over this, but Vis ́vâmitra was able to
perform this miracle even against the opposition of the devas (gods).
Vis ́vâmitra also got the better of Vasishtha in their next contest, which
involved King Harishcandra, son of Tris ́anku. Harishcandra had no children by
his one hundred wives, so upon the advice of his chief priest Vasishtha and
against Vis ́vâmitra’s warning, he became involved with the sacrificial rituals to
the god Varuna. However, Varuna’s price for granting children was that the first
one be sacrificed to him. After many years of postponing this human sacrifice,
finally the day came. S ́unahs ́epha, the young prince who was to be the victim,
having just received the sacred thread, had been secretly trained with a magical
mantra that would win over Varuna. This training had been given by Vis ́vâmi
tra. S ́unahs ́epha chanted the varunamantra as he was tied to the slaughter-stone,
and Varuna appeared, granting the boy his freedom and the king a cure from the
Characters, Themes, and Concepts 301



disease that had come to him for not performing the sacrifice. S ́unahs ́epha was
given to Vis ́vâmitra, according to the logic that since his teaching had given
S ́unahs ́epha his life, Vis ́vâmitra was the prince’s father.
Vis ́vâmitra was given many other roles. He had another relationship with an
apsara named Rambhâ. He appeared as an advisor of King Râma and his brother
Lakshmana. In the Mârkandeya Purâna Vis ́vâmitra’s feud with Vasishtha
reached the point that they each cursed the other to become birds. However,
their fighting continued with such fury that Brahmâ changed them back into
sages and forced them to reconcile their differences.

VRINDÂVANA
Home of Krishna
Vrindâvana was both the mythical land of Krishna’s youth and an actual geo
graphic area between modern Delhi and Agra. Vrindâvana’s meaning of “sacred
basil grove” referred to the ancient forest that once graced that region. The mod
ern town lies on the western bank of the Yamunâ River. (See main entry under
Kâlindî.)
It was to Vrindâvana that the cowherds of Gokula retreated when King
Kamsa’s violence toward Krishna became too much for them to bear. It was in
Vrindâvana the Krishna and his older brother Balarâma grew, played, teased, and
generally lived an idyllic life—with only an occasional interruption from a
demon or demoness bent on killing them.
This region (Vraja, or Braj) became self-aware in the sixteenth century when
the Krishna cult of Bengal connected myth and devotion by pilgrimage to the
very places mentioned in the stories and established actual sites for devotees to
visit. Caitanya directed his disciples, the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, to purify long for
gotten sites and renew worship there. The six great Gosvamis (cow monks
referring to the cowherd period of the Krishna myth) did just that and had
mahârâjas of Râjesthan build splendid temples to Krishna.
Now this entire region is rich with pilgrimage sites, and during the months
of the monsoon pilgrims walk and play where Krishna and Râdhâ did, hear the
many dramas and performances, and worship in the many temples along the
route.

VRITRA
A mighty asura (demon)
In the Rigveda Vritra was a monster whose name meant the one who “held
back,” “restrained,” or “enveloped.” Killing Vritra was Indra’s crowning moment.
Vritra enveloped a celestial mountain and held back its waters, but Indra’s action
released the waters, bring the fertilizing rains and prosperity to the Aryans, even
providing soma for gods and men. He did this with his thunderbolt, implying that
he was a nature god of rain and storm, but also a war god who brought victory and
bounty. He accomplished his victory over Vritra by both his strength as a warrior
and his magic as a priest. Since Vritra also used magic in the single combat against
Indra, he was later said to be a brâhmin—thus in the later versions making Indra
a brâhmin-killer. Also later, it was a brâhmin who provided his own thigh bone
to make the divine weapon, Indra’s thunderbolt (vajra)—the sage Dadhîci. Alter
nately, Indra was reduced in the Purânic literature to so little of his former power
that he had to be joined by other gods to conquer Vritra, or even to receive his abil
ity to conquer Vritra from S ́iva or Vishnu.
There was a rebirth story in the later Purânas that explained Vritra’s origin.
He came from a curse by Pârvatî. Citraketu had received a boon that allowed
him to fly with his wife. He both misused it and laughed at S ́iva’s wife, Pârvatî.
She and S ́iva were playing in Kailâsa and Citraketu thought their love play was
humorous. However, Pârvatî did not think much of being spied upon and cursed
Citraketu to be reborn as Vritra-asura.
The killing of Vritra and his cohorts is one of the many places where Vedic
myths can be compared with Indo-European mythology. This theme—the
killing of the dragon—has many versions. It involves a particularly ancient myth
of creation by dismemberment, fertility motifs that require sacrifice, and the sin
or pollution of these acts, which can only be purified by the rituals known by the
wise of the community.

VYÂSA
The most famous sage in Hindu mythology
Vyâsa is more properly referred to as Veda Vyâsa since the name was a common
one, meaning “arranger,” or editor. Veda Vyâsa was said to have edited the four
Vedas and authored the Purânas and the Mahâbhârata. Accomplishing all that
would require a human who lived several thousand years, so scholars do place
the story of his achievements as those of one man in the area of mythology.
Vyâsa was born to the brâhmin ascetic Parâsara and Matsyagandhî, the
fisher-woman. (See main entry under Satyavâtî.) Parâsara married Matsyagandhî
gandharva style in a fog while crossing the Vamunâ River and left her immedi
ately. Vyâsa was born on an island (dvîpa) and dark of complexion (krishna), so
that he was also known by Krishna Dvaipâyana. Although he was an ascetic like
his father, he was asked to father sons by his dead stepmother’s wives, resulting
in the famous kings Dhritarâshthra and Pandu.
Vyâsa had another son who never entered a womb. Nârada had found him
somewhat depressed and thought that the cause was Vyâsa’s desire for a son. So
Vyâsa began a severe penance near Mount Mahâmeru. But Indra was threatened
and sent Ghritâcî, the apsara (celestial damsel), to stop him. She changed into a
beautiful parrot who had five colors. Vyâsa became infatuated with the parrot
(s ́uka) and discharged his seed on some of the firewood. As the wood was placed
in the fire, a divine son was created. Vyâsa named him S ́uka after the parrot.
S ́uka grew into a householder sage and helped Vyâsa put together a great educa
tional institution at his as ́rama (hermitage). However, when S ́uka left and
attained divinity, Vyâsa became quite unstable, wandering about calling out his
son’s name (“parrot, parrot”). S ́uka appeared as a vision and consoled his father.
Later the sage lost all his disciples. In his next birth Vyâsa was reborn as Apân
taratamas, continuing his rebirths and proving that even a sage like Veda Vyâsa

YÂJÑA
Ritual of sacrifice
Yâjña or sacrifice was practiced from the earliest period of the Vedas. At first it
referred to the external fire sacrifices and oblations that constituted the princi
304 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



pal way in which Aryans related to their gods. Offerings were made to the fire
(agni) of clarified butter (ghî or ghee), wood, spices, grains, soma (the ambrosia
of immortality), and even animal sacrifices. Later sacrifices became vegetarian
with the exception of Tântrics and S ́aktas.
Yâjña as internal sacrifice was articulated as early as the Upanishads by
equating the external fire with the internal heat (tapas) of mediation and, by fur
ther extension, the austerities (tapas, sadhanâs) in order to acquire boons and
powers (siddhis). Yâjña is always associated with fire, both the physical fire that
carries the offerings to heaven for the enjoyment of the gods or Agni, god of fire,
as the divine messenger who transports prayers and offerings to their divine
objects.

YAMA
A god
Yama came to be the god of
death in later mythology, but
he had wide range of roles in
the earlier mythology. In the
Rigveda Yama was one of
the first pair. As such he was
referred to as the first mortal
(later being called the first
human). His twin sister
Yamî wanted him as her
partner, but he refused. Later
mythology charged him with
incest. In the earliest myth
ology he was the son of
Vivasvat, an early solar deity.
Later he was assimilated into
Dharma, god of social order,
and made one of the
guardians of the four corners
of the earth (Lokapâlas).
Yama was personi- fied in
the Katha Upanishad, and
his talk with the youth

Naciketas about the nature of death and its mystery portrayed him as a great
philosopher-teacher.
During his evolution in later mythology Yama became more sinister, the
feared god of death. His two dogs, Syama and Sabala, came for souls, no longer
leading them to Devayâna (way of the gods) or Pitryâna (way of the departed
ancestor spirits), but to a stopover in Pâtâla (hell). Pâtâla too had changed from
a comfortable abode of the dead to a realm of punishment populated with all
sorts of dreadful creatures: rakshâsas (blood-thirsty demons), yakshas (tree spir
its), ganas (dwarves), and angirasas (a class of ghosts), as well as souls of the
dead. Yama became associated with time as a killer (Kâla) and death (Mrityu),
and thereby with the lord of the cremation ground, S ́iva.
See also Dharma; Kâla; S ́iva; Upanishad
YAMUNÂ
A river
See main entry under Kâlindî. This is an alternative name for the river Kâlindî
of Purânic fame. The river goddess of Kâlindî was also the wife of S ́rî Krishna.
YOGA, YOGAS
A system of thought and practice
The word yoga is frequently used in Indian philosophy. It means “union” and con
notes uniting the individual self with the higher Self. The Bhagavad Gîtâ defined
yoga as “skillfulness in action” and “steadiness of mind.” Yoga as a system of
Indian thought was founded by Patanjali, probably of the second century B.C.E.
Around the time of the Bhagavad Gîtâ Indian philosophers and theologians
began to classify religious or spiritual experience according to three or four types,
which they called ways (margas) or disciplines (yogas). Devotion (bhakti)
appeared in both classifications of religious types. Devotion was the way (marga)
or practice (yoga) known as bhakti marga or bhakti yoga. Two other types
appeared in both lists: karma yoga (the way of works, or ritualism) and jñâna
yoga (the way of knowledge). The fourth type, râja yoga (the royal way), influ
enced the way jñâna yoga was interpreted. In a list of three religious types, jñâna
yoga and râja yoga referred to mysticism—knowledge of the Absolute. Thus,
both were essentially mystical paths, leading to knowledge of the Absolute. The
distinctive yoga of cognitive, spiritual study (jñâna) that produced far more than
the six traditional philosophies (dars ́anas) was lost.
When four religious types are recognized, râja yoga is mysticism and jñâna
yoga is a rational, philosophical path of knowledge, meaning, and purpose.
306 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Among these paths or spiritual disciplines, bhakti is the most accepting and
appreciative of mythology and its uses, while the jñâna yoga of Hindu rational
ism was unsympathetic and even hostile toward mythology. Rational Hin
duism’s modern manifestation, the Brahmo Samaj, is consistent with those
philosophers of the past who rejected idols and myths. Mystical practice (râja
and/or jñâna yoga) entails renunciation of everything, including worship,
images, and myths.

YUVANÂS ́VA
A king who got pregnant
Yuvanâs ́va was a king who had a hundred wives but no children. In the Vishnu
and Bhâgavata Purânas Yuvanâs ́va went into the forest to seek help from asce
tics. Yuvanâs ́va found a group of brâhmins who promised him sons if he did a
special ritual sacrifice, the Indradaivata yâga. It involved collecting energy from
their mantras in a jug of water as the rituals were performed each day. One day
Yuvanâs ́va was thirsty and made the mistake of drinking from the jug of water
that was storing the mantras to bring him children. Yuvanâs ́va became pregnant
and after ten lunar months gave birth to a child. Mândhâta (or Mâdhât≥i) was
born from the pregnancy of his father, Yuvanâs ́va. But the ministers of his king
dom advised that he abandon the child in the forest. Although that was done,
Mândhâta was nourished by sucking milk from his own toe—an idea credited to
Indra, whose mantra had produced the child. When Mândhâta reached manhood,
he became a great and powerful king. There were many allusions in other stories
to his virtue and wisdom.

B
ecause Hindu mythology is living, active, and still developing, categories
that work well for dead mythologies falter. Fortunately, Hindus have been
tolerant and forgiving about how these categories often distort our under
standing. Books suggested could easily fit in more than one category (under both
myth and religion, for example).
When one began a study in a new area of interest such as Hindu mythology,
learning how to gain access to the various kinds of resources and evaluating their
worth used to be a serious hurdle. Now, on the other hand, finding current and
available resources has never been easier. Evaluating their worth is still difficult,
because it is relative to one’s interest. American Hindu parents (members of
what is called the Hindu Diaspora) might have several extra criteria in mind
depending on their personal religious perspective, their desire to find books rep
resenting an insider rather than an outsider point of view, and so on. A college
professor on comparative world literature would have another set of criteria in
mind for choosing a text or set of readings on Hindu mythology. Thus, the first
task is to determine one’s needs and interests.
So much has changed with electronic access to bibliographic lists that a
review of some of the basics seems to be in order.
Fallacy #1. Only books are valuable reference and research tools.
It is true that reference and research tools are more likely to be refereed by
scholars and edited for publishers and are more reliable than nonprint materials.
However, most North American libraries are organized with both print and non
print materials. Knowing how to use both types of materials and how they work
together is important. In the section of this chapter on nonprint resources, spe
cific materials are referenced, and at the same time solid research strategies are
suggested to help one find what is available from the Internet—either by using
one’s computer or that of a library. By following these suggestions you will be
able to locate digital resources that complement your print materials and are
appropriate to your needs.
311



Fallacy #2. A good bibliography will meet the needs of teachers, parents, and
children.
Needs and interests vary widely. My undergraduate students need one bib
liography, my graduate students another. However, my three granddaughters
would not appreciate one book on either list. For those who want a book on
Hindu mythology for their third grader for a school assignment, the choices will
be much different than for parents looking for a book to read to or along with the
child. Research tools are more useful here than a list, as new books are published
each month. Currently, a set of resources for evaluating children’s books is The
Horn Book Guide and Horn Book Magazine (www.hbook.com). These provide
reviews of children’s and young adult books. The guide reviews, rates, and
indexes practically every hardcover trade children’s book and is helpful for par
ents and teachers. Public library databases and commercial search engines (such
as http://www.amazon.com and http://www.google.com) also work well for par
ents and teachers searching for what is available.
For the sake of providing examples, I will list a few children’s books on
Hindu mythology that have received good reviews and that were available com
mercially at the moment of this writing: The Broken Tusk: Stories of the Hindu
God Ganesha (recommended for ages 10–12) by Uma Krishnaswami (North
Haven, CT: Linet Books, 1996); The Butter Thief (for ages 4–8) by Chris Murray
(Kim Murray, illustrator), (Los Angeles, CA: Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, 1996);
and Demons, Gods and Holy Men from Indian Myths and Legends by Shahrukh
Husain (Durga Prasad Das, illustrator), (New York: Peter Bedrick Books, 1979).
Another resource on the availability of children’s books on Hindu mythol
ogy is Hinduism Today, a monthly magazine, which also has an online presence
(www.HinduismToday.kauai.hi.us). However, the online version does not have
the advertisements for children’s books that are carried in the published addi
tion. Occasional reviews of books are published online.
With some reservations about passing along this information, I will mention
Hindu comic books. Absurd as such a choice might seem, one would be choos
ing the way many children in India have learned about Hindu myths and leg
ends. One series, by Amar Chitra Katha (www.amarchitrakatha.com), has over
180 titles. They are currently distributed by Navrang, Inc. (www.navrang.com),
but distributors change. Another comic book publisher is Chaturang Katha
(which does not have a web presence at this writing). Both Amar Chitra Katha
and Chaturang Katha were distributed by India Book House and Penguin Books
India (www.penguinbooksindia.com). Again, that has changed. If one is looking
for children’s books on South Asia on the Web, Asia Book House (www.asia
bookhouse.com) and Pilgrims Books of Kathmandu (www.pilgrimsbooks.com)
are good sources.
312 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



Fallacy #3. Published addresses on the World Wide Web should work [forever].
The Internet changes constantly (an old Buddhist insight about life), so one
must adapt every search idea or learn to find what has evolved or survived. The
public library and commercial search engines such as the one offered by Ama
zon.com (http://www.amazon.com) will help most popular readers who are new
to Hindu mythology. Web sites in the next section should help also (as long as
they survive). Scholarly Web sites tend to last slightly longer than individual and
commercial sites (but scholars die, move on to a new university, and some even
“password” or hide their sites when they become too popular).
For some recommendations on sites that are likely to survive for some time
see the section on the Wide World Web below.
Fallacy #4. Books by believers should only be read by believers.
The Himalayan Academy, the Bhaktivedanta Society, and many other
devout Hindu organizations are publishing many good books. The perspective of
such books may be much narrower than a scholarly one, but often the readabil
ity is very high. They are especially good for those who are involved in interfaith
dialogue. These books can be found with public library and Web search engines
(such as www.google.com). A few examples from the time of this writing are Lov
ing Ganesa by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami Subramuniya (Kapaa, HI:
Himalayan Academy Publications, 2000); Dancing With Siva: Hinduism’s Con
temporary Catechism by the same author (Kapaa, HI: Himalayan Academy Pub
lications, 1997); and the many writings of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
Prabhupâda (popularly known as the founder of the Hare Krishnas) on Bhakti
Yoga and Hindu scriptures such as the Bhâgavata Purâna and the Bhâgavad Gîtâ.
Fallacy #5. Only scholars can use Sanskrit dictionaries.
An amazing resource, which should be used by every student of Hindu
mythology and religion, is a set of online Sanskrit dictionaries that makes it pos
sible for a serious student to look up any term and study its varying meanings as
it is located in different texts and contexts. At first, the beginner will have to
work with English searches. However, with a little practice many nonspecialists
can learn to enter Sanskrit transliterations with Roman letters. Go to <http://
www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/tamil/mwd_search.html> and work with
the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon. (For further discussion see entry dis
cussing the dictionary below.)
The bibliography that follows will be helpful for readers who are seeking
scholarly materials that are sufficiently reliable to serve as a foundation for their
study. If one becomes a serious student of Hindu mythology, then Sanskrit is a
must. And if one continues, then regional Indian languages must be added as
well, for local Hindu mythologies. Only English language materials lie within
the scope of this working bibliography.

Bary, William Theodore de, ed. Sources of Indian Tradition. 2 vols. New York:
Columbia University Press, 1958.
Still an excellent resource to give the student of Hinduism an idea about the
extent and complexity of scripture in India.
Basham, A. L. The Origins and Development of Classical Hinduism. Boston:
Beacon, 1989.
Kenneth Zysk, one of Basham’s students, crafted this volume from
Basham’s lecture notes. It is a good introduction to Hinduism, but it does
not have the power and influence of Basham’s classic history, The Wonder
That Was India.
Bhardwaj, Surinder Mohan. Hindu Places of Pilgrimage in India. Berkeley: Uni
versity of California Press, 1973.
A ground-breaking study of pilgrimage sites and their significance in pro
viding a process by which a pan-Indian tradition could be perceived despite
all its variety.
Dimock, Edward C., Jr. The Place of the Hidden Moon: Erotic Mysticism in the
Vaisnava-sahajiyâ Cult of Bengal. Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1966.
This text links the myth cycles of Vishnu, Krishna, and Radhâ with the rit
ual and devotional elements of Bengali Vaishnavism. It is scholarly and
highly recommended for the intermediate student of Hindu religion and
mythology.
Dimock, Edward C., Jr., ed. and trans. The Thief of Love: Bengali Tales of Court
and Village. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963.
320 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



This volume situates itself in the study of regional (in this case Bengali)
medieval literature. But it is much more. It demonstrates the overlap in
medieval India of literature, religion, and mythology.
Flood, Gavin. An Introduction to Hinduism. Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1996.
This introduction for college students attempts to present both sides of
every issue in the study of Hinduism. For example, in the discussion about
the origin of the Aryans both “the invasion” and “the indigenous origin”
hypotheses are thoroughly discussed, and no conclusion is drawn.
Fuller, C. J. The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India.
Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.
This was written as a textbook for the university classroom. It is a solid
study, sociological in its basic approach and rich in detail.
Haberman, David L. Journey through the Twelve Forests: An Encounter with
Krishna. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994.
The study combines an account of the Ban Yatra, the pilgrimage to the
sacred sites around Krishna’s birthplace, with an analysis of related myths,
history, and religion. It is an excellent introduction to the study of Krishna.
Hawley, John Stratton, and Mark Juergensmeyer, eds. Songs of the Saints of
India. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988.
This anthology serves to introduce poets and singers who represent a
medieval devotional tradition that translates the myths into religious fer
vor. Ravidas, Kabir, Nanak, Surda, Mirabai, and Tulsidas embody a mythic
world of gods and grace.
Jamison, Stephanie W. Sacrificed Wife, Sacrificer’s Wife: Women, Ritual and
Hospitality in Ancient India. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996.
This exploration of the conceptual model for the role of women in ancient
India combines history, religious studies, feminist studies, and mythology.
This study may serve as an example of the excellent work being done in this
area.
Kakar, Sudhir. Shamans, Mystics and Doctors. Boston: Beacon, 1983.
For intermediate students, this study explores the social dynamics of Indian
religion from a psychoanalytic perspective.

Neville, Robert C., ed. vol. 1, The Human Condition; vol. 2, Ultimate Realities;
vol. 3, Religious Truth. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2001.
These three volumes were done by a team of comparativists and area spe
cialists; a chapter in each volume covers Hinduism. It is highly recom
mended for the advanced student in Hindu studies.
Neufeldt, Ronald W., ed. Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments.
Albany: State University of New York Press, 1986.
This volume surveys the reform, modernist, and traditionalist approaches
and their understandings of karma and rebirth. For intermediate or
advanced students of Hinduism.
O’Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, ed. Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Tradi
tions. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980.
This volume covers both orthodox and heterodox, or, as scholars call them,
orthoprax and heteroprax traditions, in the early and classical periods of
Indian history. For intermediate or advanced students of Hinduism.

This collection of eight essays demonstrates the richness of devotion to
Krishna and its mythological connections. It is scholarly in perspective and
can best be utilized by students with a good background in Hindu religion
and mythology.

Texts in Translation
This list makes no attempt to be adequate for two reasons: the scriptural and lit
erary tradition is so vast, and the number of translations so great. The bibli
ography in Wendy O’Flaherty’s Hindu Myths and Origins of Evil in Hindu
Mythology (see above) are excellent. New translations are published and
carefully reviewed each year in scholarly journals, so the list is expanding
rapidly. There are several sites on the Internet that attempt to be current on
Hindu scripture in translation (see below). The four books listed simply hap
pen to be both well done and readily available.
Dimmitt, Cornelia. Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader In The Sanskrit Purä
nas. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1978.
Representative and well done.
O’Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, ed. and trans. The Rig Veda: An Anthology. London:
Penguin, 1981.
A work by University of Chicago giant and standard setter.
Olivelle, Patrick, trans. Dharmasûtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India.
Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999.
———. Upanisads. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996.
Reliable and readable translations that should work well in the classroom.
History
Basham, A. L. The Wonder That Was India: A Survey of the Culture of the
Indian Sub-Continent before the Coming of the Muslims. New York:
Grove, 1954.
This classic just will not die. It is such a monument of scholarship, histori
cally and culturally, that the offense of implying that “the wonder” ended
with the arrival of the Muslims can be ignored. It is still the best introduc
tion to ancient India for most people.

Video and Film
India produces more film and video than any other country for its billion people.
Only a tiny fraction of these productions have much international appeal. Two
recently published encyclopedias have attempted to classify this enormous out
put, but they are already almost out of date: The Encyclopaedia of Indian Cin
ema by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen (London: British Film Institute,
1999) and “India” by Radha Subramanyan in The International Movie Industry,
edited by Gorham Kindem (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press,
2000).
One online resource that is stable and expanding is the WWW Virtual
Library’s section on Indian Film <http://www.india.com.ar/india213.html>.
Currently there are 122 Web sites on Indian film studies, including sites on
actors and actresses and sites on specific directors like the internationally
known Satyajit Ray.

Films for the Humanities and Sciences <http://www.films.com> has a sec

However, their search engine revealed that they had 34 films on India for sale.
They also are a clearinghouse for BBC, Discovery Channel, and other sources for
documentaries.
Many commercial films have mythic themes, and some might be of inter
est. More films have become available in video stores for rental. A search of
Blockbuster (www.blockbuster.com) yielded 120 videos with “India” in the title.
However, they had no subject or theme category, so specific titles had to be used.
The films that struck me as possibly useful include Bandit Queen (1994) with
Seema Biswas; Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996) with Indira Varma (R rated);
and Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi (1982) with Ben Kingsley. A search for the
director Satyajit Ray netted 34 videos, 10 of which were available, including
Pather Panchali (1955) and The World of Apu (1959).
Filmakers Library <http://www.filmakers.com> features award-winning
Indian commercial films and videos. Their current list of Indian films contained
nothing on Hindu myths per se. However, 2 of the 21 were promising: “Tales of
Pabuji: A Rajasthani Tradition” and “Valley of The Gods: Worship in Kat
mandu.” (For descriptions go to their Web site.)
The Hartley Film Foundation <http://www.hartleyvideos.org> has two good
introductory films on religion in India, “India and the Infinite” and “Hinduism:
Song of God.”
CD-ROM and DVD
There are a number of CD-ROMs on either Hindu religion or mythology in
English in India. I reviewed some when I was in Bangalore a few years ago that
were Vaishnava in perspective. However, they are not being distributed in North
America and do not have an Internet presence at the time of this publication. I
think this situation will change rapidly, so one needs a search strategy rather than
a list that will go out-of-date quickly. Tools mentioned previously include Google
(www.google.com), Amazon.com (www.amazon.com), Yahoo (www. yahoo.com),
Selected Print and Nonprint Resources 327



and other popular commercial search engines. Hinduism Today contains adver
tisements for CDs but these do not appear in the electronic version on the Inter
net (www.HinduismToday.kauai.hi.us).
Web sites on Hindu Mythology
There is no problem in finding a few thousand Web sites that contain materials
(writing and graphics) about Hindu mythology. The quality and entertainment
value of some are quite high. If one expects to find scholarly, refereed materials
with both scope and depth at this point in time, one may only find that level of
material in “passworded” university professors’ Web sites. Without the pass
word this material will not be accessible. That being said, there are some useful
materials available. But remember the warning at the beginning of the chapter:
change is constant, and this is particularly true of Web sites; they come and go.
A list of the best Web sites is far less valuable than knowing what kind of
materials are currently available and how one goes about finding them.
Spelling
It is unlikely that you will be able to search in Sanskrit (Devanâgarî) on the Inter
net for some years to come (assuming that you would want to try). So you will
have to take into account the many ways Hindu mythological terms are spelled
(depending on how the Sanskrit letters are transliterated, or how speech is tran
scribed). For example, “Siva” for S ́iva will net many finds, but so will “Shiva.”
“Krishna” for K≥s·øa is the most used English spelling, but even “Krsna” will net
some results. If the person is Hindi-speaking, they might also use “Krishn” or
“Krsn,” since the final a is dropped even when Sanskrit words are brought over
into Hindi. The word citra (painting) is a very popular name and begins many
Sanskrit compounds. However, its pronunciation invites the spelling as chitra,
which approximates its pronunciation. There is also a real ch in Sanskrit, but it
was often designated as chh in the past. Not everyone has switched to c and ch
rather than ch and chh.
Commercial vs. Scholarly Sites
If you do not mind being lured to a site in order for them to “give you a cookie”
(to obtain information about your visit and possibly your email address), then
commercial sites with some graphics and text abound. They will grow even more
attractive and plentiful in the future. All you need to do is search from your
browser on a current search engine and thousands of sites will magically appear.
Scholarly sites are harder to find. General search engines (except for Google)
seldom list them, unless at the very end of a search. Many commercially moti
328 Handbook of Hindu Mythology



vated search engines give special preference to sites that advertise, and so com
mercial sites emerge at the beginning of your search. Of course, if you want to
buy a book on Hindu mythology, then it will please you that your search is
tracked and you receive the appropriate news about what is available from Ama
zon.com or some other firm. (See the discussion at the beginning of this chapter
about finding children’s books.)

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
G
eorge M. Williams was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa in
1972, specializing in religion in modern India. Williams taught for one
year at Newton College of the Sacred Heart, Boston, before going to Cal
ifornia State University, Chico, in the fall of 1972, joining their newly formed
Department of Religious Studies.
His major interest for the past two decades has been in religions that liber
ate and in liberal religion. This interest has been furthered by his participation
in the International Association for Religious Freedom and has led to two hon
orary doctorates: In May 1994 Starr King School for the Ministry awarded
Williams with the Litterarum Humanarum Doctor, and in October 1996
Williams was presented the award of Doctor Honoris Causa from the United
Protestant Seminary of Cluj [Kolozsvar], Romania.
A specialist on Svâmî Vivekânanda and the Hindu Renaissance, Williams
helped found the section on Hinduism in the American Academy of Religion. He
also served on the Electronic Publishing Committee of the academy and was its
projects director for a number of years. In both 1997 and 1998 Williams held the
Shree Muherjee Chair at National Institute of Advanced Studies, National Sci
ence Campus, Bangalore. While there he worked on projects involving preserva
tion, digital archiving, translation, and preparation of a comprehensive database
of the Bhagavad Gita and other sacred texts. In 1998 he held workshops for
archivists and librarians from all over India on use of the Internet for research
and publication, CD-ROM publication, and digital archiving.
In 2001 Williams completed a two year project: the digitizing and archiving
of the works of Raja Rammohan Roy, the great reformer of Hinduism and the
founder of the Brahmo Samaj. His goal is to finish a number of books and videos
that will advance the notions of liberating spirituality.
