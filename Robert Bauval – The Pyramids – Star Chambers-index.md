have attracted more scholars and crack
pots alike than any other edifice on earth
in the attempt to solve conclusively the
riddle that they pose: Who built them?
How were they built? When? And why?



THE PYRAMIDS STAR CHAMBERS
Mystery in Stone
As if deliberately to bedevil the generations through the ages,
the pyramids and Sphinx of Giza were left completely bare by
their mysterious builders. No writings, no drawings and no arte
facts were ever found inside or outside the Giza pyramids.
When the pyramids were opened in medieval times by the
Arabs they were as empty as they are today. Strange corridors,
galleries and chambers with smooth walls bereft of inscriptions
are all you will see, and in each only a mysterious empty stone
coffer, which modern Egyptologists have, perhaps too hastily,
assumed to be coffins for dead kings. Austere and silent, the
Three Pyramids and the Sphinx loom like gigantic question
marks on the desert sand, always taunting, always challenging
those who gaze upon them.
Mysterious legends and myths abound about these structures.
The most persistent is that the Giza Pyramids and the Sphinx
are the legacy of a super-race of men, perhaps from the lost
continent of Atlantis, who settled in Egypt after a great flood
and there, at Giza, concealed all their knowledge and wisdom in
a “Hall of Records’ under the bedrock. This century such ideas
became widespread when America’s famous ‘Sleeping Prophet’,
Edgar Cayce, predicted that the fabled ‘Hall of Records’ of the
Atlanteans would be discovered under the Sphinx or inside the
Great Pyramid around the year 1998. Cayce died in 1945;
today the Edgar Cayce Foundation, also known as the ARE

over the world and since the early 1970s has sponsored several expeditions to
Giza to search for the ‘Hall of Records’. As we shall see later, recent findings
suggest that Cayce might be right after all.
Egyptologists and archaeologists, of course, dismiss such ideas as pure fan
tasy. They see in them nothing but the obsessed dreams of myth-makers and
psychics. To them the matter is classified and closed. There is no mystery
here. The Three Pyramids of Giza are tombs for the pharaohs of the 4th
Dynasty who ruled in about 2500 Bc during an epoch known as the Old
Kingdom. Recently, however, a group of new researchers has challenged
such views with new scientific evidence. Using geology and astronomy as
dating tools, they have shown that the Sphinx of Giza could be thousands of
years older than Egyptologists think, and that, far from being tombs only, the
Giza Pyramids may be part of a ‘time capsule’ put there by a highly
advanced civilization that is yet to be discovered.
Could the myth of Atlantis be true ?

Pyramid Facts
There are some 92 pyramids in Egypt; this figure, however, is misleading. THE
; A ‘ ps 7 . 4 PYRAMIDS:
Many of these pyramids are simply small shrines built in later times and bear STAR
little or no resemblance to the scale and design of the Giza Pyramids. CHAMBERS
According to Egyptologists, the golden age of pyramid building in Egypt
began in the 3rd Dynasty (c.2686 BC) and ended in the 6th Dynasty (c.2181
€
BC). During those few centuries over 25 ‘great’ pyramids were built along a
narrow strip of desert on the west side of the River Nile near the modern
city of Cairo. Today this region is known as the Memphite Necropolis
(necropolis means ‘city of the dead’ in Greek), and stretches from Dashour

some 20 km from the modern city of Cairo, to Abu Ruwash, which lies 15 km
to the north-west of the city. The Giza monuments are roughly at the centre
of this ‘land of the pyramids’.
The view among Egyptologists is that the Pyramid Age began when a man
called Imhotep, a high priest and vizier of the pharaoh Zoser of the 3rd
Dynasty (c.2681 BC), designed the famous Step Pyramid complex at Saqqara.
This curious pyramid, which towers 60 m above ground level, along with

boundary wall and temples, is the world’s first architec
tural project. Although the Step Pyramid is a very large
structure in its own right, it was to be dwarfed by the
mighty pyramids of the great 4th Dynasty. The founder
of this remarkable dynasty, the pharaoh Sneferu, dramat
ically increased the scale of construction and introduced
the so-called ‘true’ pyramid design with slopes cased in
smooth white limestone slabs.
Sneferu built two pyramids at Dashour, known today as
the Red Pyramid and the Bent Pyramid. The casing slabs
of the Red Pyramid have completely vanished — probably
stripped off in the Middle Ages by the Arabs to build the
mosques and palaces of Cairo. Without its white casing
slabs this pyramid glows with a reddish tint at sunrise and
sunset, hence its modern name. The Bent Pyramid, which
retains most of its original casing, is so named because it
has a slope that changes halfway up the monument. Both
pyramids are about 100 m tall and, altogether, contain
more than 9 million tonnes of stone blocks.
Until recently the site of Dashour was closed to visitors because it was
within an Egyptian military base. In October 1996, however, the Supreme
Council of Antiquities acquired the site and it is now open to the general
public. Only the Red Pyramid, however, can be entered. It has a most
remarkable inner system with three enormous chambers having smooth walls
and high corbelled ceilings bare of any inscriptions.
The son of Sneferu was Khufu, better known today as Cheops, a name

given to him much later by the Greeks. Determined to outdo his father,
Cheops commissioned an even more massive pyramid on a rocky platform
overlooking the Nile Valley near the modern village of Giza, 10 km west of
Cairo. Looming more than 140 m, like some huge tidal wave of stone, it is, in
the words of one Arab historian, ‘the mother of all pyramids’. Indeed, until
the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris in 1889 and the Hoover Dam in
Arizona in the 1930s, the Great Pyramid was the tallest and most massive

man-made edifice in the world. It contains no less than 6 million tonnes of
stone, and its huge base, with sides that measure 230 m, is almost perfectly
orientated to true north within 5 per cent of a single degree of arc.
It is calculated that the base of the Great Pyramid, which occupies an area
of more than 4.5 hectares, is large enough to accommodate over 200 tennis
courts. The superstructure of this amazing monument contains over 2.5 mil
lion blocks of stone each weighing an average of 2 tonnes. Yet some of the

blocks used to construct the inner cham

40 tonnes each. To add to the mystery,
many of these huge blocks were brought
from Aswan, a region 1,000 km south of
Giza. Such a feat of engineering and
organization would task to the limit the
most experienced modern construction
companies. Needless to say, it is very
hard to imagine how this project was
achieved by people who supposedly had
just emerged from the Stone Age with no
knowledge of the pulley or even the
wheel, and using only simple copper
tools. Theories abound as to how the

The son of Cheops, Khafre, was known to the Greeks as Chephren. He,
too, built a huge pyramid at Giza almost as large and as perfect as his prede
cessors’. He was followed by his son Menkaure, whom the Greeks called
Mycerinos. The latter raised the third and last ‘great’ pyramid at Giza. This
pyramid, however, is 65 m tall and thus less than half as tall as the other two.
‘Two other kings of the 4th Dynasty, Nebka and Djedefre, also planned pyra
mids near Giza, one at Zawyat Al Aryan to the south-east and the other at
Abu Ruwash to the north-east, but these were apparently never completed.

of Giza, and at Saqqara, which is a further 5 km to the south. These pyra
mids are much smaller than those of the 4th Dynasty; the quality of their
construction is shoddy and the accuracy of alignment inferior.
No mummies or funerary articles were ever found in any of the pyramids.
To add to this strange enigma, the great 4th Dynasty pyramids of Dashour
and Giza, as we have said earlier, do not contain inscriptions of any kind.
Yet, and in contrast to this stark nakedness, many of the 5th and 6th Dynasty
pyramids at Saqqara are full of hieroglyphic texts. These are known as the
Pyramid Texts. These and other later texts make it clear that the living king

lization to Egypt in a remote golden age known
as Zep Tepi (the First Time). Horus, his only
son, who was identified with the sun, was born
from the womb of the great goddess Isis, herself
identified with the bright star Sirius.
During their lifetimes the pharaohs were
believed to be the reincarnation of Horus,
known in his solar form as Hor-Akhti, which
means Horus of the Horizon. When a pharaoh
died he was replaced by a new Horus, and his
own soul became astar and joined Osiris in the
heavenly Duat. As the Pyramid Texts proclaim:
Behold, Osiris has come as Orion... O King, the
sky conceives you with Orion . . . you will regularly
ascend with Orion from the eastern region of the sky
... O Ring you are this great star, the companion
of Orion, who traverses the sky with Orion, who
sails in the Duat with Osiris. . . [Pyramid Texts,
lines 820 and 882]
There can be little doubt, therefore, that the
pyramids were regarded as the agency through
which the souls of the departed kings could find their way to the stars of
Orion in the Duat. A major clue supporting this idea is, of course, the astro
nomical alignment of the pyramids, which could only have been achieved by
22









stellar sightings. Another clue is the name ‘Rostau’, which was given to the
Giza complex by the ancient Egyptians, and means ‘the tunnel [or shaft] that
leads to the Duat’.
There is also the fact that many of the pyramids were given star names.
For example, two 4th Dynasty pyramids — at Zawyat Al Aryan and at Abu
Ruwash — were called ‘the pharaoh Nebka is a star’ and ‘the pharaoh
Djedefre is a star in the Duat’. In the Pyramid Texts there is a pertinent
passage which identifies the king with his pyramid and both, in turn, are
identified with Osiris/ Orion:
O Horus, this king 1s Osiris, this pyramid of the king 1s Ostris, this construction of
his is Osiris . . . [Pyramid Texts, line 1657]
This has lead some researchers to conclude that the pyramid builders saw the
pyramids not as tombs but as ‘stargates’ to enter another cosmic dimension
in Orion.

Gateway to the Stars
Inside the Great Pyramid are to be found two large chambers known as the
King’s Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber. From each of these chambers
emanate two narrow shafts, one directed to the south and the other directed
to the north. The shafts are 20 x 20 cm across and slope upwards into the
solid core of the pyramid. At first they were thought to be for ventilating the
chambers, but recently it has been discovered that the shafts of the Queen’s
Chamber were closed at both ends, making such a function redundant.
In 1963 a team of researchers discovered that the shafts of the Great Pyra

mid were astronomically aligned. Those going north were aimed at the cir
cumpolar stars, and those going south towards the three stars in Orion’s Belt
(Osiris) as well as the bright star Sirius (Isis). Because these were the main
stars of the Duat region which the souls of dead kings were supposed to
inhabit, it was concluded that the Three Giza Pyramids were somehow imag
ined to have a direct connection with these special stars.
Ih 1984 a new theory was proposed by myself (developed in 1994 in The
Orion Mystery). This theory shows how the pattern formed by the Three Great
Pyramids and their relative position to the Nile mirrors the pattern formed
by the three bright stars of Orion’s Belt and their relative position to the
Milky Way, the latter considered to be the ‘Celestial Nile’ by the ancient
Egyptians. The giveaway was the offset of the third and smaller pyramid
from the general layout plan. This was mimicked precisely by the similar
position of the third and smaller (dimmer) star in Orion’s Belt.
What the star/pyramid correlation also showed, however, was that the
ground-to-sky patterns matched only in 10,500 Bc. The position of the stars
appears to change slowly over time, due to a phenomenon known as the pre
cession of the equinoxes, which is caused by a slow, wobble-like motion of
the axis of the earth over period of 25,920 years. Over such immense period
of time the stars of Orion’s Belt, for example, would appear to swing up and
down like a huge pendulum. There is another effect of precession that is
observed along the path of the sun across the 12 constellations of the zodiac;
these, like the figures on a carousel wheel, appear to pass in front of a fixed
point in the sky called the vernal point — the place the sun occupies during
the spring equinox. The passing of a zodiacal constellation over the vernal
point denotes an astrological ‘age’ which last some 2,160 years (12 x 2,160 =
25,920). The sun, of course, does not rise at the same place on the eastern
horizon throughout the year. In midsummer it rises to the far north of due
east, and in midwinter it rises to the far south of due east. It is only at the

equinoxes (21 March and 21 September) that the
sun rises due east.
wvesus: The Great Sphinx of Giza was deliberately
ge made to gaze due east, and thus can be said to be
a marker of the equinoxes and, in astrological
terms, the marker of an ‘age’. But which age?
Since the birth of Jesus it has been the zodiac
constellation of Pisces which contained the vernal
point and rises due east on the day of the spring
equinox. Soon it will be the constellation of
Aquarius, marking the new Aquarian Age. At the
epoch of 2500 BC, when the Sphinx is supposed
to have been built, it was the Age of Taurus. Yet
the Sphinx is carved in the shape of a lion, not a
bull. We have to go back in time to 10,500 Bc for
the vernal point to be in the zodiac constellation
of Leo. At this epoch the Great Sphinx would
have gazed at its own image in the sky. The
ancients called the Great Sphinx ‘Horus in the
Horizon of Giza’. We have seen how the solar
image of the living pharaoh was also called
‘Horus of the Horizon’. Several inscriptions found
near the Sphinx dating to later periods confirm
that the ancient Egyptians regarded the Sphinx of
Giza, the ancient Rostau, as being the ‘splendid
place of the First Time’. These inscriptions also

speak of Osiris as Lord of Rostau, and how he had brought civilization to
Egypt in the First Time.
Computer simulation of the ancient skies show that the beginning (or First
Time) of the current precessional cycle of Orion occurred in 10,500 BG. The
computer also shows that on the day of the spring equinox in 10,500 Bc Leo
would have been in direct alignment with the Great Sphinx at the exact time
the stars of Orion’s Belt aligned with the Three Great Pyramids. It must be
noted, too, that the next time such a perfect sky-to-ground conjunction will
occur is in about AD 2100.
Could the Giza monuments, with their almost perfect astronomical align
ments and correlation to Orion’s Belt and Leo be a deliberate time marker
for the First Time, the pharaonic genesis? Is it possible that the mysterious
ancient builders use their sophisticated knowledge of astronomy to conceal a
map, not made from papyrus, which could easily be lost, but a map cleverly
drawn, as it were, on the billboard of the ancient sky in ¢.10,500 Bc?
Today, with computer simulation, we can actually reconstruct this ‘map’.
Oddly, the vernal point in 10,500 BC, and thus the spot marking “X’ on this
sky map, is directly under the rump of the celestial lion, the constellation of
Leo. For many years Egyptologists have known that a tunnel leads from the
rump of the Great Sphinx deep into an unknown location under the
bedrock. Recently an American team, lead by the Egyptologist John
Anthony West, using high-tech radar and sensing equipment have detected
several large cavities under the Sphinx, one of which lies near this tunnel.
The Egyptian authorities, however, deny there is anything in there and have
stopped all further exploration. Oddly, John Anthony West and his team also
discovered that the erosion and weathering of the Sphinx and its enclosure
would fix its age to around 10,500 Bc.
In March 1993 the German robotics engineer, Rudolf Gantenbrink,
explored the mysterious narrow shafts of the Queen’s Chamber in the Great
