"Indian astronomy: a historical perspective". In Biswas, S. K.; Mallik, D. C. V.; Vishveshwara, C. V. (eds.). Cosmic Perspectives. Cambridge University Press, p.29)

That Bhishma computed Pāṇḍava exile period using Jyotiṣavedāṅga is clear jyotiṣa pramāṇa, astronomy evidence, that Jyotiṣavedāṅga was the calendar --pancāṅga in vogue in MBh time.
Drona's suggestion was to find out if the Pandavas meant that their exile was not yet over.
It was Drona who had suggested to find out the Pandavas before the completion of their exile, after the death of Kichaka.
[Drona to all]
Let us, therefore, once more search after them, sending Brahmanas and Charanas, ascetics crowned with success, and others of this kind who may have a knowledge of those heroes!'"

[Reaction of Bhishma]
"Vaisampayana said, 'Then that grandsire of the Bharatas, Bhishma the son of Sutanu, conversant with the Vedas, acquainted with the proprieties of time and place, and possessing a knowledge of every duty of morality, after the conclusion of Drona's speech, applauded the words of the preceptor

The MBh text gives some indications about the calendar in vogue in MBh times; it is likely to be Jyotiṣavedāṅga.

"Vaisampayana said, 'Having listened to these words of his spies, king Duryodhana reflected inwardly for some time and then addressed his courtiers, saying, 'It is difficult to ascertain the course of events definitely. Discern ye all, therefore, whither the sons of Pandu have gone, of this thirteenth year which they are to pass undiscovered by us all, the greater part hath already expired. What remains is by much the smaller. If, indeed, the sons of Pandu can pass undiscovered what remains of this year, devoted to the vow of truth as they are, they will then have fulfilled their pledge. ..

"Vaisampayanasaid, 'Then that grandsire of the Bharatas, Bhishma the son of Sutanu, conversant with the Vedas, acquainted with the proprieties...of time and place, and possessing a knowledge of every duty of morality, after the conclusion of Drona's speech, applauded the words of the preceptor and spake unto the Bharatas for their benefit these words...And the grandsire of the Kurus said, 'The words that the regenerate Drona acquainted with the truth of every affair hath uttered, are approved by me. I have no hesitation in saying so. Endued with every auspicious mark, observant of virtuous vows, possessed of Vedic lore, devoted to religious observances, conversant with various sciences, obedient to the counsels of the aged, adhering to the vow of truth, acquainted with the proprieties of time, observant of the pledge they have given (in respect of their exile), pure in their behaviour, ever adhering to the duties of the Kshatria order, always obedient to Kesava, high-souled, possessed of great strength, and ever-bearing the burthens of the wise, those heroic ones can never wither under misfortune. “

The expression, describing Bhishma --“deśakālajñas tattvajñaḥ sarvadharmavit... samayaṃ samayajñās te pālayantaḥ śucivratāḥ” is translated by KM Ganguly as “conversant with the Vedas, acquainted with the proprieties, ...of time and place, and possessing a knowledge of every duty of morality”.
It is reasonable to infer that Jyotiṣavedāṅga was used as a calendar to compute time in MBh times.
