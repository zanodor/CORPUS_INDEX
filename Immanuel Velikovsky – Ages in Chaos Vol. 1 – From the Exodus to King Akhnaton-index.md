FOREWORD
AGES IN CHAOS was conceived in the spring of 1940. It was then
that I realized that the Exodus had occurred in the midst of a
natural upheaval and that this catastrophe might prove to be the
connecting link between the Israelite and Egyptian histories, if
ancient Egyptian texts were found to contain references to a similar
event. I found such references and before long had worked out a
plan of reconstruction of ancient history from the Exodus to the
conquest of the East by Alexander the Great. Already by October
of the same year I had come to understand the nature and extent
of that catastrophe. For a decade after that I worked simultaneously
on Ages in Chaos and Worlds in Collision, the present work
requiring the lion's share of the toil.
Ages in Chaos covers largely the period dealt with in Worlds in
Collision - the eight hundred years from the Exodus of the Israelites
from Egypt to the invasion of Palestine by Sennacherib in 687
B.C., and the additional three and a half centuries to Alexander of
Macedonia, altogether twelve hundred years of the history of the
ancient East. But whereas the first work concentrated on the
description of the physical history of the period, the present work
deals with its political and cultural aspects. The occurrence of a
widespread natural catastrophe serves here only as the point of
departure for constructing a revised chronology of the times and
lands under consideration.
I searched the records of one land after another and went from
one generation to another, taking from everywhere hints and clues,
evidence and proof. Because I had to discover and to collate them,
this book is written like a detective story. It is well known that in
detective work unexpected associations are often built on minute
details: a fingerprint on a bar of metal, a hair on a window sill, a
burnt-out match in the bushes. Some details of an archaeological,
chronological, or paleographic nature may seem minor matters, but



they are the fingerprints of an investigation in which the history of
many nations in many generations is vitally involved. Such details
are not included to make the reading difficult; they are necessary to
establish the main thesis of this work. Therefore, any attempt to
read this book cursorily will prove to be a fruitless undertaking.
Correct strategy requires that once a bridgehead is established it
should be fortified. Is it good judgment, instead, to open a second
front against a new adversary?
After the publication of Worlds in Collision, a volume describing
two acts of a celestial and terrestrial drama, reconstructed from the
collective memory of the human race, a wise and proper move
would have been to strengthen my position by following with a
volume of geological and paleontological evidence of the same
dramatic events in the life of the earth. And since this material from
the realm of stones and bones is not rare but abundant, such an
undertaking would seemingly not be difficult. It was therefore a
great temptation for me to continue from where I had left off in
Worlds in Collision, to prove again and again, from new angles,
that catastrophes did take place and did disrupt slow-moving eve.
lution in inanimate as well as animate nature. And in fact, since the
publication of Worlds in Collision, I have devoted myself to
organizing the evidence from geology and prehistory to
supplement the literary and historical evidence of cosmic
catastrophism, and to writing Earth in Upheaval, only little
concerned with the storm aroused by my first book. But I found
that the arguments presented in that book were not given a careful
hearing, or even reading, particularly by those who protested the
loudest. Would it help to produce in haste still more evidence? In
my inner council on strategy, I decided to tarry no longer with Ages
in Chaos, my opus magnum.
I call Ages in Chaos the second front because, after having
disrupted the complacent peace of mind of a powerful group of
astronomers and other textbook writers, I offer here major battle to



the historians. The two volumes of the present work will be as
disturbing to the historians as Worlds in Collision was to the
astronomers. It is quite conceivable that historians will have even
greater psychological difficulties in revising their views and in
accepting the sequence of ancient history as established in Ages in
Chaos than the astronomers had in accepting the story of cosmic
catastrophes in the solar system in historical times. Indeed, a
distinguished scholar, who has followed this work from the
completion of the first draft in 1942, expressed this very idea. He
said that he knows of no valid argument against the reconstruction
of history presented here, but that psychologically it is almost
impossible to change views acquired in the course of decades of
reading, writing, and teaching.
The attempt to reconstruct radically the history of the ancient
world, twelve hundred years in the life of many nations and
kingdoms, unprecedented as it is, will meet severe censure from
those who, in their teaching and writing, have already deeply
committed themselves to the old concept of history. And many of
those who look to acknowledged authorities for guidance will
express their disbelief that a truth could have remained
undiscovered so long, from which they will deduce that it cannot
be a truth.
Should I have heeded the abuse with which a group of scientists
condemned Worlds in Collision and its author? Unable to prove
the book or any part of it wrong or any quoted document spurious,
the members of that group indulged in outbursts of unscientific
fury. They suppressed the book in the hands of its first publisher by
the threat of a boycott of all the company's textbooks, despite the
fact that when the book was already on the presses the publisher
agreed to submit it to the censorship of three prominent scientists
and it passed that censorship. When a new publisher took the book
over, this group tried to suppress it there, too, by threats. They
forced the dismissal of a scientist and an editor who openly took an
objective stand, and thus drove many members of academic
faculties into clandestine reading of Worlds in Collision and



correspondence with its author. The guardians of dogma were, and
still are, alert to stamp out the new teaching by exorcism and not
by argument, degrading the learned guild in the eyes of the broad
public, which does not believe that censorship and suppression are
necessary to defend the truth. And here is a rule by which to know
whether or chronological, or paleographic nature may seem minor
matters, but they are the fingerprints of an investigation in which
the history of many nations in many generations is vitally involved.
Such details are not included to make the reading difficult; they are
necessary to establish the main thesis of this work. Therefore, any
attempt to read this book cursorily will prove to be a fruitless
undertaking.

still are, alert to stamp out the new teaching by exorcism and not
by argument, degrading the learned guild in the eyes of the broad
public, which does not believe that censorship and suppression are
necessary to defend the truth. And here is a rule by which to know
whether or not a book is spurious: Never in the history of science
has a spurious book aroused a storm of anger among members of
scientific bodies. But there has been a storm every time a leaf in
the book of knowledge has been turned over. "We are most likely
to get angry and excited in our opposition to some idea when we
ourselves are not quite certain of our own position, and are
inwardly tempted to take the other side."1
A scientific approach requires, first, reading, then thinking and
investigation, and, lastly, the expression of an opinion. in the case
of Worlds in Collision the procedure was repeatedly reversed.
Scientific rejection demands invalidation of the evidence presented.
Nothing of the kind was done with Worlds in Collision. The few
arguments offered - whatever could be gathered from numerous
reviews - I answered point by point in a debate with Professor J. Q.
Stewart, astronomer at Princeton University, published in the June
1951 issue of Harper's magazine, fourteen months after the
publication of the book. No argument was left unanswered, and no
new one has been presented since then, though emotional
outbursts have not ceased. Finally, a new strategy was employed:
the views expounded in Worlds in Collision were appropriated
piecemeal by those who first opposed them, though not with
frankness and candor, but rather under the guise of showing how
wrong the author of that heretical book is. At present no chapter of
Worlds hi Collision needs to be rewritten and no thesis revoked.



Great are the changes in the political history of the ancient East
offered in Ages in Chaos. I claim the right to fallibility in details and
I eagerly welcome constructive criticism. However, before
proclaiming that the entire structure must collapse because an
argument can be made against this or that point, the critic should
carefully weigh his argument against the whole scheme, complete
with all its evidence. The historian who permits his attention to he
monopolized by an argument directed against some detail, to the
extent of overlooking the work as a whole and the manifold proofs
on which it stands, will only demonstrate the narrowness of his
approach to history. He will be like that "conscientious scientist,"
Professor Twist, in Ogden Nash's verse, who went on an expedition
to the jungles, taking his bride with him. When, one day, the guide
brought the tidings to him that an alligator had eaten her, the
professor could not but smile. "You mean," he said, "a crocodile?'
I believe that the evidence collated in Ages in Chaos warrants the
reconstruction offered. Sooner or later, and it may be any day,
some new archaeological discovery will verify the main thesis of
this book, and then it will become apparent even to the indolent,
for whom only a fulfilled prophecy is an argument.
The recent discovery of two-language texts - old Hebrew and
"Hittite" pictographs - and thus of a clue to the undeciphered
pictographs of Asia Minor and Syria, gives promise of revealing
facts of unmeasured significance.
For this reason, too, I should delay no longer the present
publication. Is it not the case that at first a new idea is regarded as
not true, and later, when accepted, as not being new?
The publication of the second and final volume of Ages in Chaos
is scheduled for a few months from now. There the reader of the
first volume will find the eventual solution of the drama in which
centuries are shifted on the scale of time.
IMMANUEL VELIKOVSKY
February, 1952



DEDICATION
This work is dedicated to my late father. I want to say in a few
sentences who Simon Yehiel V. Velikovsky was.
From the day when, at the age of thirteen, he left the home of his
parents and went on foot to one of the old centers of talmudic
learning in Russia, to the day when, in December 1937, at the age
of seventy-eight, he ended his years in the land of Israel, he
devoted his life, his fortune, his peace of mind, all that he had, to
the realization of what was once an idea, the renaissance of the
Jewish people in its ancient land. He contributed to the revival of
the language of the Bible and the development of modern Hebrew
by publishing (with Dr. I. Klausner as editor) collective works on
Hebrew philology, and to the revival of Jewish scientific thought by
publishing, through his foundation, Scripta Universitatis, to which
scientists of many countries contributed and thus laid the
groundwork for Hebrew University at Jerusalem. He was first to
redeem the land in Negeb, the home of the patriarchs, and he
organized a co-operative settlement there which he called Ruhama;
today it is the largest agricultural development in northern Negeb. I
do not know whom I have to thank for intellectual preparedness for
this reconstruction of ancient history if not my late father, Simon.



ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
In composing this reconstruction, I incurred a debt to
archaeologists, who for more than a century have toiled in
excavating numerous places in the lands of the ancient East; to
generations of philologists, who have read the ancient texts; and to
those among the scholars who have made easier the work of
research by collecting and classifying the material.
I am grateful to Dr. Walter Federn, of the Asia Institute, New
York, who has always been ready to help me with his incomparable
knowledge
Egyptological literature. I feel my obligation to him all the more
because he has never committed himself to my thesis. It took him
more than six years to concede that conventional history is not
built on unshakable foundations. His arguments have been a
steady incentive for me to collect more and more proof, to collate
more and more historical material, until the book attained its
present form. His criticism has always been constructive.
I am also indebted to Dr. Robert H. Pfeiffer, outstanding
authority on the Bible. Director of the Harvard excavation at Nuzi,
curator of the Semitic Museum at Harvard University, professor of
ancient history at Boston University, editor of the Journal of
Biblical Literature (1943-47), and author of a distinguished
standard work on the Old Testament, he is eminently qualified to
pass judgment. In the summer of 1942, when the manuscript was
still in its first draft, he read Ages in Chaos and suggested that I try
to prove my thesis on archaeological art material. I followed his
advice, and the second volume of this work carries chapters on
"Ceramics and Chronology" and "Metallurgy and Chronology," in
addition to a number of scattered sections dealing with the
problems of ancient art, paleography, and stratigraphical
archaeology. He read later drafts, too, and showed a great interest
in the progress of my work. Neither subscribing to my thesis nor



rejecting it, he kept an open mind, believing that only objective and
free discussion could clarify the issue.
Neither he nor Dr. Federn nor anyone else shares any
responsibility whatsoever for any statement in this book.
Professor J. Garstang, excavator of Jericho, read an early draft of
the first chapter. It was his opinion that the Egyptian record of the
plagues, as set forth in this book, and the biblical passages dealing
with the plagues are so similar that they must have had a common
origin.
Dr. I. J. Gelb and the late Dr. S. I. Feigin, both of the Oriental
Institute of the University of Chicago, graciously answered
questions put to him without being informed as to the thesis of my
work. Dr. C. H. Gordon of Dropsie College also was kind enough
to answer a number of questions in his field. I express to them my
appreciation.
Dr. Horace M. Kallen, professor and sometime dean of the
Graduate faculty of the New School for Social Research, New York,
a humanist and humanitarian, gave me his unfailing moral support
during all these years, because he knew the odds against which I
had to work and the opposition I would meet.
I was fortunate to have had the help of Miss Marion Kuhn, who
with great care went over the entire manuscript more than once
and offered numerous improvements in style. Mrs. Kathryn Tebbel
of the Doubleday staff proved to be a copy editor of great
keenness, well versed in the Scriptures.
I should not omit to say that I have had every possible
consideration from Mr. Walter Bradbury, managing editor of
Doubleday and Company, who made me feel that all the facilities
of this great publishing house were at my disposal.

INTRODUCTION
This is not descriptive history in the usual meaning of the term. It is
a sequence of chapters, each of which is like a court hearing,
where witnesses are brought to the stand to disprove the validity of
the old and to attest to the accuracy of a new concept of ancient
history. The old story of mankind, never before disputed, is here
assailed as distorted, and a reconstruction is presented. The period
under investigation covers over one thousand years, ending with
the advent of Alexander the Great.
Many wondrous things happen when historical perspective is
distorted. In order to understand the scope of the displacements in
the history of the ancient world, one must try to conceive of the
chaos which would result if a survey of Europe and America were
written in which the history of the British Isles were some six
hundred years out of line, so that in Europe and America the year
would be 1941 while in Britain it would be 1341.
As Columbus discovered America in 1492, the Churchill of 1341
could not have visited this country, but must have visited some
other land - the scholars would be divided in their opinion as to the
whereabouts of that land - and met its chief. Another chief, not
Franklin Delano Roosevelt of Washington, would live in history as
cosigner of a charter with Churchill of Britain in 1341.
But as American records would speak of Churchill who crossed
the ocean in the early forties of the twentieth century, British
history would also have a Churchill II, six hundred years after the
first one. Cromwell would also be doubled by the same process. He
would have to live three hundred years before Churchill I and also
three hundred years after him, or three hundred years before
Churchill II.
The First World War would be fought twice, as would the
Second. The First World War, in its second variant, would follow



the Second World War, in its first variant, by five and three quarter
centuries.
By the same token, the development of the Constitution, the
cultural life, the progress of technology and the arts, would appear
in chaotic distortion.
Newton in England would become an early forerunner of
Copernicus instead of following him. Joan of Arc would revive the
old traditions of the suffragettes of the post-Victorian days; she
would be burned twice with an interval of six hundred years
between; or, with the growing confusion of history, she would have
to return to the stake a few centuries from today to suffer her death
again.
In the case presented, not only the history of the British Isles
would be doubled and distorted, but also the history of the entire
world. Difficulties would, of course, arise, but they would be swept
away as oddities. Complicated theories would be proposed and
discussed, and if accepted, they would establish themselves as new,
strong obstacles to a correct perception of past history.
Ancient history is distorted in this very manner. Because of the
disruption of synchronism, many figures on the historical scene are
"ghosts" or "halves" and "doubles." Events are often duplicates;
many battles are shadows; many speeches are echoes; many
treaties are copies; even some empires are phantoms.
The primary error can be found in Egyptian history; because of
retardation, the history of Egypt was taken out of real contact with
the histories of other peoples. Events in which the people of Egypt
and the people of Assyria or Babylonia or Media were bivolvecl
were recorded in the histories of these peoples from the Egyptian
annals; the same events were then described for the second time in
the history of Egypt, the annals of these other peoples, participants
in the events, being the source.
Thus the histories of Assyria, Babylonia, and Media arc disrupted
and spoiled; the history of the "Hittite Empire" is entirely invented;
the Greek history of the Mycenaean period is displaced and that of



the pre-Alexander period is lacerated and Spartan and Athenian
warriors, even those with well-known names, appear once more on
the pages of history as archaic intruders out of the gloom of the
past.
The process of leveling out the histories of the peoples of the
ancient world to an exact synchronism will provide some exciting
moments. We shall see in a new light many historical documents
which had been misinterpreted when presented in an incorrect
historical perspective.
We shall read the story of the plagues of the days of the Exodus,
written by an Egyptian eyewitness and preserved on papyrus. We
shall be able to establish the identity of the mysterious Hyksos, and
also to indicate the site of their stronghold Auaris, probably the
greatest fortress of ancient times. We shall read the Queen of
Sheba's record of her journey to Jerusalem in the days of Solomon,
and shall see illustrations depicting this voyage and showing the
inhabitants, animals, and plants of Palestine of that time. We shall
have before our eyes photographs of the vessels and furniture and
utensils of the Temple of Solomon as cut in stone bas-reliefs by a
contemporaneous artist. Then will follow texts of letters written by
the Jewish kings Jehoshaphat of Jerusalem and Ahab, the sinner of
Jezreel, and also by their military chiefs, signed with names we
know from the Scriptures.
Of still greater scope are the effects of the revision for Egyptian,
Assyrian, and Babylonian histories, and also for the concept of the
Greek past. The rectification of chronology, without altering the
sequence of the Hebrew past, enriches its records bountifully. The
history of Egypt, and following it the histories of Babylonia,
Assyria, Media, Phoenicia, Crete, and Greece, change their length.
The architectonics of the world past, when redesigned, shows its
structure properly joined in time and space. It shows that kings
were made they own great-great-grandchildren. Imaginary empires
were described, and museum halls have been opened to display
the arts of empires which did not exist: the art objects are products
of other centuries, even of another millennium. This is the case



with the Hittite Empire and its art. This is the case with the Hurrian
people and their language.
Through the laborious efforts of scholars, achievements have
been recorded without knowledge of their real nature. The
Chaldean language was deciphered, but its decipherers did not
know that they were reading Chaldean; handbooks about the
Carian language were written, but the industrious philologists did
not know that it was Carian.
It is not possible in a short introduction to point out all the things
which appear in a new light when correctly placed in time. When
the hinges of world history are lifted to an adequate height, facts
about peoples and countries, their art and religion, their battles and
treatises pour down as if out of a horn of plenty. Certainly more
than one fact and more than one parallel must have been
overlooked in this book, but this is a shortcoming from which a
pioneer work is seldom free.



Chapter 1
IN SEARCH OF A LINK BETWEEN
EGYPTIAN AND ISREALITE HISTORIES
Two Lands and Their Past
PALESTINE, one of the westernmost lands in Asia, and Egypt, in
the northeast corner of Africa, are neighboring countries. The
history of Egypt reaches back to hoary antiquity; the Jewish people
has a history that claims to describe the very beginning of this
nation's march through the centuries. At the dawn of their history
the Israelites, an unsettled tribe, came from Canaan to Egypt.
There they grew to be a people; there, also, they bore the yoke of
bondage. Their eventful departure from Egypt is the most treasured
recollection of their past, and their traditions tell its story
numberless times.
The annals of Egypt, we are told, did not preserve any record of
this sojourn of the Israelites or of their departure. It is not known
when the Exodus occurred, if it happened at all. A few scholars
have expressed the opinion that the sojourn of the Israelites, their
bondage, and their departure are mythological motifs; the absence
of direct reference to these events on Egyptian monuments and
papyri seems to corroborate this view. However, it has been argued
that no people would invent legends about bondage which were
not calculated to enhance the dignity of the nation, and therefore,
it was insisted, there must be a historical basis for the story.
Historians disagree as to the date of the Exodus, and many
hypotheses have been proposed. But for more than two thousand
years they have agreed that the Exodus took place during the
period called in present terminology "the New Kingdom" of Egypt.



Egypt's past is divided into the following periods:
1. The predynastic period belonging mainly to the Neolithic or the
Late Stone Age.
2. The Old Kingdom, when most of the pyramids were built: the
Fourth Dynasty, that of Cheops, and the Sixth, that of Phiops, are
the best known.
3. The first interregnum, when the land fell into chaos: central
authority was abolished in this dark age. Of the dynasties from the
Seventh to the Tenth almost nothing is known.
4. The Middle Kingdom, comprising the Eleventh, Twelfth, and
Thirteenth Dynasties: feudal Egypt was united under the Twelfth
Dynasty, and Egyptian literature reached a height never again to be
attained.
5. Another period of chaos, exploited by certain invaders known as
Amu in Egyptian and called Hyksos by authors writing in Greek.1
The Hyksos kings were pharaohs of the Fourteenth to the
Seventeenth Dynasties and they ruled over Egypt without mercy;
it is not known of what race they were.
6. The New Kingdom. The Hyksos were expelled at the time of
Ahmose (Amasis I), who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, the most
renowned of all, the dynasty of Thutmose I; the famous Queen
Hatshepsut; Thutmose , the greatest of all Egyptian conquerors;
Amenhotep II, Thutmose IV; Amenhotep , the builder of
magnificent temples at Luxor and Karnak; and Amenhotep IV, who
called himself Akhnaton, the great heretic. The epigoni followed;
among them the young king Tutankhamen is best known, not be
cause of the distinction of his reign, which is obscure, but because
of the riches in his tomb, discovered early in the twenties of this
century, and because of the mystery that has surrounded his burial
place.
The Eighteenth Dynasty declined under conditions that are not
sufficiently known, and history records that the Nineteenth
Dynasty, that of Seti the Great, Ramses II (the Great), and
Memeptah, followed.



The period of transition from the Nineteenth to the Twentieth
Dynasties is obscure.
Among the kings of the Twentieth Dynasty Ramses was the most
prominent; he was the last great emperor of ancient Egypt.
1. The pharaohs from the Twenty-first to the Thirtieth Dynasties were
small kings, who left no important records, and their age is called
the late period." Some of these pharaohs, we are told, led armies
against Palestine and Babylonia; however, the sources are usually
not Egyptian, but for the most part scriptural. Some of these
dynasties were Libyan or Ethiopian; later ones (from - 525) were
under Persian supremacy; still later ones rebelled against the
Persians. The last native king was removed by the Persians in
342. In - 332 Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great.
2. The Ptolemaic Dynasty of descendants of Ptolemy, a general of
Alexander, expired with Cleopatra in - 40.
The present work covers the time from the end of the Middle
Kingdom to the conquest of Egypt by Alexander (the periods
marked above as 5, 6, and 7), over a thousand years in the history
of the ancient East.
It is useful to remark here that the division into "kingdoms" is
modern;3 the division into dynasties comes from Manetho, an
Egyptian priest of the third century before the Christian era, who
wrote in Greek; the designation of kings as "first," "second," "third,"
is an arrangement of modern scholars.
The beginning of the New Kingdom is established to have been
about - 1580 (the expulsion of the Hyksos in the time of Kamose
and Ahmose); Akhnaton must have reigned from - 1375 to - 1358;
Ramses II of the Nineteenth Dynasty from - 1300 to - 1234; and
Merneptah from this last year on. Ramses of the Twentieth Dynasty
began to reign in - 1200 or a few years later. These dates are
regarded as of importance for establishing the time of the Exodus.
The history of Israel from the days of the Exodus on is composed
of the years of wandering in the desert, according to tradition forty



years, of the time of Joshua and Judges and the first king, Saul,
about four hundred years, and of the time of the kings of the
House of David. David established his kingship about - 1000. For
only approximately one hundred years, during the reigns of Saul,
David, and Solomon, was the kingdom undivided. In the days of
Solomon's heir it was split in two - Israel in the north and Judah in
the south. About - 722 the Ten Tribes of Israel, after the capture of
their capital, Samaria, by Sargon II of Assyria, went into exile, front
which they did not return. In - 587 or - 586 Judah, after the
destruction of its capital, Jerusalem, by Nebuchadnezzar, went into
Babylonian exile, from whence small groups of the nation came
back after Babylon was captured (in - 538) by Cyrus the Persian.
Addi-tional groups returned to Palestine during the following
century,
Alexander the Great conquered Palestine on his way to Egypt in
-333.
Although Egypt and Palestine are closely neighboring countries,
"the truth is that there is in Egypt singularly little evidence which
bears directly on the Bible narrative."4 The Scriptures tell of the
sojourn of Israel in Egypt and of the Exodus; but no documents
referring to these events have been found. There is no scriptural
mention of Egypt during the time of the Judges. However, in the
days of the Kings Palestine repeatedly came into contact with Egypt
- mostly through being attacked by armies of the pharaohs,
campaigns which the pharaohs of the tenth to the sixth centuries
usually forgot to mention.
It is strange that there is no real link between the histories of
Egypt and Palestine for a period of many hundreds of years. At
least the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt was an event that
should belong to both histories and thus supply a connecting link.
We shall therefore try to determine during what period of Egyptian
history the Exodus took place.
Whether it occurred only one or two hundred years before
David. or three or four or five hundred years before hint,



depending on the length of the periods of the wandering and of the
Judges - in other words, whether the Israelites left Egypt in the
sixteenth, fifteenth, fourteenth, thirteenth, or twelfth century - this
event occurred during the New Kingdom. There has never been
any doubt on this point; where scholars have differed is concerning
the king of the New Kingdom to whose reign the Exodus is to be
ascribed. Although, as noted above, no definite statement bearing
directly on the Exodus has been found in Egyptian historical
documents, certain details do appear which invite discussion.
1 The name Hyksos as "rulers of foreign countries" is found in the Egyptian text of the
Turino Papyrus and on a few scarabs.
2 The Seventeenth Dynasty is generally regarded as the native dynasty of princes in
submission to, and then in revolt against, the last kings of the Sixteenth, the Hyksos,
Dynasty. But in Manetho's list, as given by Julius Africanus and Eusebius, the Seventeenth
Dynasty is the last of the Hyksos.
3 °The division into kingdoms is modern, but the Egyptians themselves had similar
concepts of their past. Compare H. Ranke in Chronique Egypt, VI (1931), 277-86.
4 T. E. Peet, Egypt and trio Old Testament (Liverpool, 1622), p. 7.
What Is the Historical Time of the Exodus?
The oldest theory places the Exodus at the earliest date: the
Israelites were identified with the Hyksos, and the Exodus was
identified with the expulsion of the Hyksos. Manetho, the priest
previously mentioned, wrote that the Hyksos, when expelled from
Egypt, went to Syria and there built Jerusalem.1 Josephus Flavius,
the Jewish historian of the first century, polemized against Apion,
the grammarian, and against Manetho, his source, but accepted
and supported the view that the Israelites were the Hyksos. Julius
Africanus, one of the Fathers of the Church, wrote on the authority
of Apion that in the days of Ahmose the Jews revolted undcr
Moses.2 Eusebius, another Father of the Church, in his Canon
wrote a gloss to the name Cencheres of one of the later kings of the
Eighteenth



Dynasty (his identity is not known): "About this time Moses led
the Jews in their march out of Egypt."3
This divergence of opinion has not been settled after nineteen
centuries, though modern scholars have probably not always been
aware that they repeated an old controversy. The neglect of early
Christian sources seemed justifiable: did not Augustine make Moses
and Prometheus contemporaries?4
The identification of the Israelites with the Hyksos was many
tunes accepted° and as often rejected. Even today a group among
the historians maintains that the Exodus took place at the very
beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty and that the story of the
Exodus is but an echo of the expulsion of the Hyksos. However, in
view of the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt and the bondage of
Egypt under the Hyksos, the identity of martyred slaves and cruel
tyrants must be regarded as a very strained hypothesis. Therefore a
variant has been proposed, according to which the Israelite nation
never sojourned in Egypt; the Hyksos sojourned there and then
departed; the Israelites, hearing of the traditions of a strange
people, adapted them to the stories of their own past.
Apart from the incongruity of identifying the Hyksos with the
Israelites, the tyrants with the oppressed, there is a further
difficulty in the fact that during the time of the successors to
Ahmose there was no likely moment for an invasion of Palestine by
Israelite refugees from Egypt. The pharaohs who followed Ahmose
were strong kings, and it is regarded as established that Palestine
was under their domination.
The same argument was employed to defend the theory that the
Exodus occurred in - 1580, the time of the expulsion of the
Hyksos.
"If the expulsion of the Hyksos (c. 1580 B.c.) is too early for the
Exodus, where in the history of the powerful Eighteenth Dynasty
can we find a probable place for an event which, like the Exodus of
tradition, presupposes internal trouble and weakness in Egypt, until
the reign of Akhenaten [Akhnaton]?"7



In the days of strong pharaohs the Israelites were unable to enter
Palestine; but how were they able to put off the yoke of bondage in
the days of equally strong pharaohs?
A large group of scholars regard another moment as providing
the clue for determining the time of the Exodus. In the 1880s, in
the Nile Valley, at a place to which archaeologists gave the name of
Tell el-Amarna, a correspondence on clay tablets was found which
dated from the time of Amenhotep and his son Akhnaton. Some of
them were anxious letters written from Jerusalem (Unisalirn),
warning the pharaoh of an invasion by the "Habiru [Khabiru],8
approaching from Trans-Jordan. Granting that the Habiru were
identical with the Hebrews, the Exodus must have taken place one
or two generations earlier.9 The scriptural statement (I Kings 6:1)
that the Temple of Solomon was built four hundred and eighty
years after the Exodus would point to the middle of the fifteenth
century, and computations have been made which indicate - 1447
as the year of the Exodus. This year would fall in the reign of
Amenhotep II; and the invasion of Palestine in - 1407 would
coincide with the time of the el-Amarna letters. The view that the
Habiru were invading Hebrews was corroborated by the results of
excavations of Jericho, where in the walls of the ancient city were
found indications of earthquake and signs of fire, which the
excavator referred to - 1407 or thereabouts - the time of the el
Amarna correspondence." This earthquake might have been the
cause of the fall of the walls of Jericho when the Israelites, after
crossing the Jordan, besieged the city.
A combination of the first and second views has also been
offered: Israel left Egypt at the time of the expulsion of the Hyksos
and reached Palestine as the Habiru in the reign of Akhnaton. But
this hypothesis would entail more than two hundred years of
wandering in the desert, instead of the scriptural forty, and it is
therefore regarded as improbable.11 An exodus in the days of
Amenhotep II, on the other hand, does not present this difficulty
and seems to agree with the chronological figures of the Bible.
However, in the view of students of Egyptology, the time of



Amenhotep II hardly seems to have been suitable for such a
venture. "Of all theories, to place the Exodus, say, in the reign of
Amenhotep II, in order to agree with traditional dates, seems to the
historian of Egypt the least probable."' 12
Stress has also been laid on the fact that Palestine was under
Egyptian rule as late as the disturbances of - 1358, which put an
end to the reign of Akhnaton. "Joshua did not find any such
Egyptian hold during his conquest."13 The end of Aklmatcm's reign
and the close of the Eighteenth Dynasty in the days of
Tutankhamen and Aye was a time favorable for rebellion and the
withdrawal of the slaves from Egypt. No reference has been found
that could be interpreted as even hinting at an exodus during the
interregnum between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties,
and only the fact that the situation was such as to make an exodus
possible favors this hypothesis. This idea found its way into the
work of a psychologist who, following in the footsteps of certain
historians," tried to show that Moses was an Egyptian prince, a
pupil of Akhnaton; that Akhnaton was the founder of monotheistic
idealism; that when Akhnaton ceased to rule and his schism fell
into clisfav(w. Moses preserved his teachings by bringing them to
the slaves, with whom he left Egypt.
The next theory reduces the age of the Exodus further: it has for
its cornerstone a stele of Memeptah, in which this king of the
Nineteenth Dynasty says that Palestine "is a widow" and that "the
seed of Israel is destroyed." This is regarded as the earliest mention
of Israel in an Egyptian document. Merneptah did not perish in the
sea, nor did he suffer a debacle; he obviously inflicted a defeat on
Israel and ravaged Palestine. The circumstances do not correspond
with the pronounced tradition of Israel, but since it is the first
mention of Israel, Merneptah is regarded by many as the Pharaoh
of the Exodus (about - 1220), and Ramses II, his predecessor, as
the Pharaoh of Oppression." Other scholars, however, consider the
mention of Israel in Palestine in the days of Memeptah not as a
corroboration, but as a refutation of the theory that Memeptah was
the Pharaoh of the Exodus. They argue that if he found Israel



already in Palestine, he could not have been the Pharaoh of the
Exodus."
A further obstacle to placing the Exodus in the reign of
Merneptah has also been emphasized. If he really was the Pharaoh
of the Exodus, then the Israelites must have entered Palestine at
least a generation later, about - 1190 to - 1180; on this theory there
remains only a century for the events of Judges. "The attribution of
the Exodus to the reign of Meneptah [Memeptah] (c. 1220 B.c.),
hitherto generally accepted as a probable guess, has always
suffered from the reproach of being almost impossibly late."17
Under the statue of Memeptah in the hall of the Metropolitan
Museum of Aft in New York, until recently S. sign by a modern
hand read, "Pharaoh of Exodus," and under that of Ramses II,
"Pharaoh of Oppression." See H. E. Win-lock, The Pharaoh of the
Exodus, Metropolitan Museum Bulletin 17 (New York, 1922), pp.
226-84.
Some scholars assumed that the Exodus occurred in successive
waves.'s A combination of the "Habiru theory" and the "Merneptah
theory" puts events into the following order: "When the Hebrews
were entering Canaan, the Israelites were still in Egypt. . . . All
Israelites were Hebrews, but not all Hebrews were Israelites. Thus
while the Israelites or Jacob tribes were in Egypt, other Hebrew
tribes were knocking at the door of Canaan.18 " The conciliators
among the scholars proposed the following solution: "Some of the
Hebrews remained in Egypt after the Exodus of the main bodv."20 "
Still later, Ramses of the Twentieth Dynasty carried on a war
against the Pereset or Peleset in Palestine. These have been
identified as Philistines. Inasmuch as in the detailed reports of this
war no mention is made of the Israelites, it is supposed by many
scholars that they had not yet reached Palestine. They are believed
to have left Egypt in the days of Merneptah (though his stele
mentions Israel as already in Canaan), but they did not appear in
Palestine until after the invading Philistines, with whom Ramses
battled." Accordingly, the invasion of Palestine by the Philistines is



put some fifty years after the Exodus and a few years before the
conquest of Canaan by Israel.
The arrival of the Israelites in Palestine in the days of Merneptah,
and still less in the days of Ramses after his campaign there in - Me,
leaves no room for the events of the Judges who guided the people
for four centuries prior to Saul and David ( - I000); but a school of
historians argued in favor of that theory: "The entry . . . could not
be till after the last war of the Egyptians there by Rameses
[Ramses] , 1186 B.C. There is no free play of uncertainty left.22
Archaeological considerations were presented to support this view.
The excavation of Bethel in Palestine, it was claimed, "shows
continuous native occupation until the break after - 1200 due to
Israelite conquest." Consequently the conclusion was drawn that
for the invasion of Palestine by Israel "no earlier date is possible.25
The divergence of opinion is even greater. We have been told
that an Exodus in the days of Merneptah is "almost impossibly
late," but a scholar challenged all other opinions by bringing the
Israelites, not from, but into, Egypt in the days of Merneptah."
During his reign Asiatics crossed the frontier and were registered by
authorities there as immigrants.
Expulsion of the Hyksos, invasion of the Habiru, defeat of Israel
in the days of Merneptah - these are the three events on which the
various schools of historians base their respective theories. It is
hopeless to try to reconcile the irreconcilable. Each group points to
the distortions in which its rivals indulge. Two hundred years of
wandering in the desert destroys one theory; one hundred years for
the period of the Judges undermines another, and so on. All of
them have one and the same obstacle to surmount: "Under any
chronological system which can reasonably be advanced, the date
of Israel's invasion and settlement falls within the period ( 1500
1100 B.C.) when the country was ruled by Egypt as an essential
portion of its Syrian Empire."25 But if this is so, how could the
Israelites have left Egypt, and, having left Egypt, how could they
have entered Palestine? Moreover, why do the Books of Joshua



and Judges, which cover four hundred years, ignore the rule of
Egypt and, indeed, fail to mention Egypt at all?
An explanation was found to account for the fact that Israel left
Egypt in the days of the strong pharaohs, but none to account for
the strange silence of the Books of Joshua and Judges. The
pharaohs were very strong, and the Exodus was only the daily
passage of Bedouins across the Egyptian border. When the
Israelites came to the frontier in a year of drought, they were
admitted, but they had to do some work of benefit to the state to
pay for the hospitality they and their herds enjoyed. When they left
Egypt, an officer gave them a permit for departure, and it may be
that he noted their leaving, but it was too trifling and stereotyped
an event to become the subject of a monumental inscription. "The
Exodus from Egypt was apparently a minor occurrence in the
history of that time, so minor, indeed, that the nation most
concerned in it next to the Jews themselves, the Egyptians, never
took the trouble to record it."26 " "One merely has to bear in mind
what this event meant, or rather, what it did not mean to Egypt.27
If this point of view is correct, then the archaeologists can have
little hope of finding in Egypt a parallel to the Book of Exodus,
amid historians have no basis on which to decide the time of an
event without significance.
If the people of Egypt did not care to notice the Exodus of the
Israelites, this search for what passed unnoticed by contemporaries
may be only a waste of time and effort.
1 Manetho, though making the Hyksos expelled from Egypt the builders of Jerusalem, told
another story, that he assigned to a later epoch, in which he related that lepers, segregated
in Auaris on the eastern border of Egypt, usurped the power in Egypt with the help of the
Solymites ( the people of Jerusalem) and were utterly cruel, and that their chief, Osarsiph,
adopted the name of Moses and led them to Palestine when they were expelled. Josephus
did not separate the two Manctho stories.

But in his Canon condensing the list of Dynasties of Manetho, he added this remark to the

Pharaoh of the Exodus, because his predecessor, Ramses II, was thought to be the Pharaoh
of Oppression. This role was ascribed to Ramses II because of the mention of the city of
Ramses in the Book of Exodus. The adherents of the Habiru theory do not regard this as a

Plagues and Portents
The biblical story does not present the departure from Egypt as an
everyday occurrence, but rather as an event accompanied by
violent upheavals of nature.
Grave and ominous signs preceded the Exodus: clouds of dust
and smoke darkened the sky and colored the water they fell upon
with a bloody hue. The dust tore wounds in the skin of man and In
in the torrid glow vermin and reptiles bred and filled air and earth;
wild beasts, plagued by sand and ashes, came from the ravines of



the wasteland to the abodes of men. A terrible torrent of hailstones
fell, and a wild fire ran upon the ground; a gust of wind brought
swarms of locusts, which obscured the light; blasts of cinders blew
in wave after wave, day and night, night and day, and the gloom
grew to a prolonged night, and blackness extinguished every ray of
light. Then came the tenth and most mysterious plague: the Angel
of the Lord "passed over the houses of the children of Israel . . .
when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses" (Exodus
12:27). The slaves, spared by the angel of destruction, were
implored amid groaning and weeping to leave the land the same
night. In the ash-gray dawn the multitude moved, leaving behind
scorched fields and ruins where a few hours before had been urban
and rural habitations.
There are two scholarly approaches to this story of the plagues
as told in Exodus, Chapters 7-11.1 One holds it to be a fairy tale.2
The story was taken apart and analyzed, and it was found that
originally the legend had told of the death of the crown prince;
then the death of one person was expanded into a plague that was
inflicted on all the firstborn.3 Later on, one plague was increased to
three; but the storytellers, still not satisfied, continued to spin out
their tale until they had a story in ten episodes. With precision the
authorship of "Elohist" and "Yahwist" was discerned.
"Neither group of legends has any historical truth at its source.
The plagues are a later substitution for older miracles. However,
miracles have never occurred anywhere.."4 "And since neither the
plagues nor the miracles are historical, no conclusion can be drawn
about the time of the Exodus."'
And when a purely realistic analysis was applied, the clever
technique of the narrators was exposed: "These are scholarly
reflections: by the hail only flax and barley were destroyed,
because they already were ripe, and the wheat with the rye were
spared because they used to ripen later. This gloss was added in
order that at the next plague the locusts should have something to
devour [etwas zu fressen haben]. 6 Sometimes the tale-spinners'



self-control failed, as can be seen in the story of the boils: "Pest
boils don't fly like ashes in the air, and still . . . Moses was made to
sprinkle the ashes of the furnace 'toward the heaven.' 7
The other approach tried to find a natural explanation for the
plagues. In Egypt the sirocco blows in the fall and in the spring; the
hot wind is also called kharnsin, meaning "fifty," because for fifty
days in the year this breath from the desert brings clouds of dust.
Pictures were produced to show the darkened sky on a day when
the khanisin blew. The desert wind may bring clouds of locusts;
they cover the sky like a screen so that during their passage the
sun's disk is obscured. The brownish color of the waters of the Nile,
especially before it overflows, is well known to all tourists, and
certain special observations near the cataracts of the Nile were
described in detail.8
The lice, fleas, and frogs of the Egypt of today have been the
subject of attentive study by reverend authors. It has been
repeatedly pointed out that the order of the plagues as described in
the Book of Exodus is exactly the order of the annual discomforts
caused by the climate and insects of Egypt under Turkish rule, and
is largely the same today.
This approach to the problem of the plagues makes of them a
year-in, year-out occurrence. Little wonder, then, that they
impressed the Egyptians in the same measure as the year-in, year
out entry and departure of some Bedouins with their cattle.
For hundreds of years thousands of scholars have paid tribute to
the story of the plagues. If pious, they have not asked questions: if
enlightened, they have defended the narrative, proving that
wonders are but trivial phenomena; if critical, they have rejected
the story, explaining it as a myth of relatively late origin.
The Book of Exodus then proceeds to tell how the Israelites were
pursued by the army of the king, who regretted their escape. They
were trapped between mountains and sea. The night was frightful.
A heavy cloud darkened the sky, which was rent by incessant
lightning. A hurricane raged the whole night, and at dawn the sea



was cleft, the waters torn by a double tide of gigantic force. The
slaves passed through; the pursuers followed in chariots; but the
waters returned, and the Egyptians with their king, fleeing against
them, met their death in the waves.
Attempts were made to explain this story as a. natural
phenomenon. It seemed difficult to give credence to its miraculous
element; but the vivid description of the night, the hurricane, and
the mountainous waves suggested that some event had actually
taken place, the memory of which was later clothed in fantastic
elaborations.9 The constant return, through the centuries, of Jewish
thought to some experience by the sea also suggested that not the
whole story had been invented. Historians agree that the most
precious tradition of the people was born on the shores of the Jam
Suf, generally translated as "Red Sea."
A river or sea cleft in two is a frequent motif in folklore. The
pursuers probably experienced some catastrophe, not because of a
sea rent in twain, but because of a tide swollen by the storm.
But an explanation based on ebb and flood tides is obviously
invalid. Whether the Sea of Passage was the Gulf of Suez or the
Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea, or Lake Sirbonis (Serbon)10
connected with the Mediterranean, or some other lake - the
Crocodile Lake, the Salt Lake, through the waters of which ships
pass today from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea - there are no
perceptible movements of flood and ebb on any of these water
surfaces - either the Mediterranean or the Red Sea or, of course,
the inland seas (lakes).
A more plausible explanation would therefore omit the tides and
content itself with the storm. Some of the chariots of the pursuing
Egyptians sank in the sea when its billows broke over the shore.
Then the Israelites sang their song of deliverance, or received the
inspiration out of which the exaggerated picture of the catastrophe
was later born. How could it be otherwise than exaggerated when
the annals of Egypt know nothing about the sea engulfing a king
and his chariots, while the descendants of the fugitives from royal



bondage glorified themselves with a story of a miraculous storm
unwitnessed by the Egyptians?
Is there then any use in endeavoring to show that a strong cast
wind, blowing from evening till dawn, could force the sea to retreat,
and that a change in the direction of the wind could overwhelm an
army marching on land? Strange, indeed, is the persistence with
which the Jewish people have clung to this story, making it the
beginning and at the same time the most dramatic episode of their
history as a nation.
The fugitives, after their escape, entered a desert, a desolate
wasteland. The Book of Exodus relates that a pillar of smoke went
before them by day and a pillar of fire by night. A simple
explanation of this portent has been found: at the head of
wandering cam-vans a torch is usually carried lifted high to show
the way to the moving train. Because of the heat of the clay,
caravans prefer to move at night, and the burning and smoking
pitch is intended to prevent anyone from being lost and to frighten
the beasts of the desert.11
Although this explanation is the one that is accepted and found
in numerous Bible dictionaries, it is too simple. The pillar of smoke
and Ere deeply impressed the Israelites; it was said to be the Angel
of God. Did the Israelites not know the manner and custom of
caravans journeying in the desert, and were they so impressed by
common things and so anxious for wonders that the torch in the
hand of the leader became for them an angel?
But the appearance of the pillar of cloud and of fire could have
been an illusion and only the invention of storytellers.
In the last century an Englishman named Charles Beke, a man
more than one strange idea, published a pamphlet entitled Mount
Sinai a Volcano.12 On the title page he placed an epigraph of two
sentences, one from the Book of Exodus, the other from the Greek
poet Pindar. The verse from Exodus 13:21 reads: ". . . by day in a
pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire,
to give them light." The lines from Pindar (Odes Pythia, I, 22-24)



describe Etna: "By day a burning stream of smoke; but by night a
ruddy eddying flame." Beginning with this parallel and going over
to the biblical description of the day of the lawgiving, Beke came to
the startling conclusion expressed in the title of his pamphlet. The
day of the lawgiving is described in these words: "And it came to
pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and
lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the
trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp
trembled. . . . And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke . . . and
the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the
whole mount quaked greatly. . . . And all the people saw the
thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and
the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed,
and stood afar off 13
Beke explained the pillar of smoke and fire as the ignited column
of ashes and vapors erupted by the volcano. He cited instances
from volcanic regions showing that volcanic eruptions can produce
black clouds of ashes that darken the sky and are sometimes swept
over great distances. Eruptions are usually accompanied by
rumblings in the bowels of the earth; earthquakes and eruptions
are often concurrent phenomena; earthquakes that shake the
bottom of the sea create tidal waves that may retreat from the
shore and then return to engulf the land, leaving destruction in
their wake. At the Sea of Passage, according to this explanation, an
earthquake created havoc; and the reference to chariots that were
unable to move parallel in the description of the earthquake that
accompanied the eruption of Vesuvius in the year 79 when
Pompeii - Herculaneum perished, a description preserved in a
letter from Pliny the Younger to Tacitus (Epistles, VI, 20): "We stood
still, in the midst of a most dangerous and dreadful scene. The
chariots, which we had ordered to be drawn out, were so agitated
backwards and forwards, though upon the most level ground, that
we could not keep them steady, even by supporting them with
large stones. The sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be
driven from its shores by the convulsive motion of the earth."



The interpretation of the wondrous events at the Sea of Passage
and at Mount Sinai as seismic and volcanic phenomena of nature
met most vigorous opposition and derision from high ecclesiastics.
"It is well known that no volcanic phenomena exist in the desert to
account for these appearances. In fact, all the expressions used in
the sacred writers are those which are usually employed in the
Hebrew Scriptures to describe a thunderstorm.14
Beke did not regard the mountainous heights of the Sinai
Peninsula as the Mount Sinai of the Scriptures. He had previously
published a work arguing for the fallacious notion that Mizraim of
the Scriptures was not Egypt, but some vanished kingdom on the
Sinai Peninsula; the Israelites, when leaving the country, crossed
the tip of the Gulf of Aqaba and came to the Arabian shore of that
gulf. He announced that he was staking his reputation as a traveler
and biblical scholar, and that, granted public assistance, he would
locate Mount Sinai in Harra Radjla, "which was formerly in activity,
but has now been extinct during many ages." An old um, he
followed, as he thought, in the footsteps of the prophet Elijah, who
also made his pilgrimage to the mountain in the desert.
When he returned, declaring that Mount Sinai is Har-Nur (Mount
of Fire), east of Ghor, a peak that, like a number of others, has a
halo around it but does not appear to have been a volcano, he
wrote that 1w was "egregiously mistaken with respect to the
volcanic character of Mount Sinai.15
His confession was published posthumously in a gilt-edged
volume, very different in appearance from Mount Sinai a Volcano.
It gave an account of the voyage: "I am therefore bound to confess
that I was in error as regards the physical character of Mount Sinai,
and that the appearances mentioned in Scripture were as little
volcanic as they were tempestuous.16
Thirty years after the theory of the volcanic character of Sinai
was enunciated, it was adopted by one scholar,17 ten years later by
a few others,18 and recently the idea that Yahweh was a local deity
of a volcano has become an oft-repeated notion; its acceptance,



however, has not prevented some scholars from denying the
historicity of the visit of wandering Israelites to Mount Sinai.19

Upheaval
If we do not limit ourselves to the few passages from the Book of
Exodus cited in support of the idea that Mount Sinai was a
volcano, the activity of which impressed the Israelites, but turn our
attention to the many other passages in the various books of the
Scriptures referring to the Exodus, we soon feel bound to make the
unusual admission that, if the words mean what they say, the scope
of the catastrophe must have exceeded by far the extent of the
disturbance that could be caused by one active volcano. Volcanic
activity spread far and wide, and Mount Sinai was but one furnace
in a great plain of smoking furnaces.
Earth, sea, and sky participated in the upheaval. The sea
overflowed the land, lava gushed out of the riven ground. The
Scriptures thus describe the uproar of the unchained elements: . . .
the earth shook and trembled; the foundations . . . of . . . hills
moved and were shaken . . .
Smoke . . . and fire . . . coals were kindled . . . the channels of
waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were
discovered.1
In a great geologic catastrophe the bottom of the sea fell, and the
waters rushed into the chasms. The earth trembled, the vol-canoes
threw smoke and fire out of the interior of the earth, cliffs were torn
away, molten rock ran along the valleys, the dry earth became sea,



the bowels of the mountains groaned, and the skies thundered
unceasingly.
His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. The hills melted like
wax . . .2
Tectonic strata collapsed. Formations changed their profile in
major displacements.
[He] removoth the mountains. . . .[He] overturneth them in his anger, [He] shaketh the
earth out of her place.3
This seismic and volcanic activity is constantly referred to the
time when the Israelites went front Egypt.
. . . the earth trembled . . . The mountains melted.......even that Sinai . . .4
The last quotation is from the Song of Deborah, one of the
oldest fragments inserted in the Scriptures.
The pious imagination conceives these utterances to be only
metaphoric. Critical analysis likewise sees in them but the
expression of an effusive ecstasy. Was there no real experience of
any kind to which the metaphors could apply? Is the following a
description of flood and ebb in the salt marshes in Egypt: ". , . the
channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world
were discovered"?5 Folklore does not work in such an
indiscriminating manner. These narratives of geologic changes,
persistently repeated in the above and many other similar passages
in connection with the time of the Exodus, must have had some
underlying experience that folklore molded and remolded. The
experience, according to the Scriptures, was so majestic and
terrible that even after a long line of succeeding generations it
could not be forgotten.
I call to remembrance my song in the night: . . . Will the Lord cast off for ever? . . .
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? . . . will remember . . . thy wonders of old. . . . The
depths also were troubled. . . . The lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled
and shook. . . . Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.6
The poet of this psalm was visited at night by a vision of the
past, when wondrous things were performed at the sea and in the
wilderness in the sight of a folk escaped from the house of



bondage.
The turbulence and uproar of nature stirred the fugitives in the
desert to a state of exaltation:
Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof;
for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of
astonishment.7
The nights under the raging sky of the wilderness torn by
unceasing lightnings, when flaming lava flowed and hills melted,
were unforgettable. During the long years in which the Israelites
lived in their land, they never forgot the convulsions of the desert,
the explosion of the burning mountain, the fury of the waters. The
events of these weeks or months, when the surface of the earth
underwent violent changes in its tectonic structure, became the
most important tradition of this nation.
The scriptural tradition persists that before the Israelites left Egypt
this land was visited by plagues, forerunners of a great holocaust
caused by frenzied elements. When the Israelites departed from the
country they witnessed gigantic tidal waves on the sea; farther off,
in the desert, they experienced spasmodic movements of the
earth's surface and volcanic activity on a great scale, with lava
gushing out of the cleft ground, suddenly yawning chasms,8 and
springs disappearing or becoming bitter.9
The logical question to be asked here is: Is this testimony entirely
false? And if it is not a collection of misleading inventions, can it be
that nothing of this was noticed by the Egyptians? If their land did
suffer from the disaster, are we not on the right track in our search
for a synchronic moment in the Jewish and Egyptian histories? A
desert close to Egypt was convulsed by earth tremors. Were these
seismic disturbances of great magnitude confined to a
comparatively small area? Is any earthquake at all mentioned in
Egyptian records?
The standard works on Egyptian history contain no mention of
an earthquake, and none of plagues. Nevertheless, we should like
to persist with our question. In this persistence we are guided by



the consideration that something great may be at stake. If we could
help this witness on the stand - the annals of ancient Egypt - to
remember some vast catastrophe, we might perchance obtain a
precious clue to an obscure problem, at whose door all disputes,
now more than two thousand years old, have remained without
decision.

An Egyptian Eyewitness Testifies to the Plagues
In this trial of history the judgment will depend on the following
statement and its probing by cross-examination.
There was a great natural catastrophe, the aftereffects of which
lasted for years. The impression it made endured, and its story was
handed down from generation to generation and echoed and
reechoed in the Scriptures and in other writings. Is no reference to
it to be found in Egyptian documents?
Or was the Exodus really an obscure and insignificant passage
through the control of the collectors of royal revenues at the
boundaries of the state? If so, how is it that it became the most
exciting memory of generations of the Jewish people? Whence
came the visions of an upheaval that rent earth and sea? Is the
turmoil that visited the land and its river, the sea and the desert,



really not to be found in Egyptian writings? Did every recollection
of it vanish?
In view of the failure of works on the history of Egypt to mention
any natural catastrophe, we should investigate the ancient sources.
It is not known under what circumstances the papyrus containing
the words of Ipuwer was found. According to its first possessor
(Anastasi), it was found in "Memphis," by which is probably meant
the neighborhood of the pyramids of Saqqara. In 1828 the papyrus
was acquired by the Museum of Leiden in the Netherlands and is
listed in the catalogue as Leiden 344.
The papyrus is written on both sides. The face (recto) and the
back ( verso) are differentiated by the direction of the fiber tissues;
the story of Ipuwer is written on the face, on the back is a hymn to
a deity. A facsimile copy of both texts was published by the
authorities of the museum together with other Egyptian
documents.1 The text of Ipuwer is now folded into a book of
seventeen pages, most of them containing fourteen lines of hieratic
signs ( a flowing writing used by the scribes, quite different from
pictorial hieroglyphics ). Of the first page only a third - the left or
last part of eleven lines - is preserved; pages 9 to 16 are in very bad
condition - there are but a few lines at the top and bottom of the
pages - and of the seventeenth page only the beginning of the first
two lines remains.
The first interpretation of the text of Ipuwer was presented in the
introduction to the facsimile.2 It was explained that eight pages of
the recto were proverbs or axioms, and the following pages were
supposed to be a chapter out of a philosophic work.
The author of the next attempt to translate the text ( only the first
nine pages) understood it as a collection of proverbs and examples
of sayings brought together for didactic use.3 Another scholar4
called the papyrus a collection of riddles.
At the beginning of this century an effort was made to translate
the entire Ipuwer text.5 The words of Ipuwer were interpreted as
prophetic in character: a time of evil was foretold for the people of



Egypt. The prophet might have been inspired by some similar
political situation in the past, before the inauguration of the Twelfth
Dynasty.
In 1909 the text, translated anew, was published by Alan IL
Gardiner under the title, The Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage
from a Hieratic Papyrus in Leiden.6 Gardiner argued that all the
internal evidence of the text points to the historical character of the
situation. Egypt was in distress; the social system had become
disorganized; violence filled the land. Invaders preyed upon the
defenseless population; the rich were stripped of everything and
slept in the open, and the poor took their possessions. "It is no
merely local disturbance that is here described, but a great and
overwhelming national disaster.7
Gardiner, following Lange, interprets the text as though the
words of a sage named Ipuwer were directed to some king.
blaming him for inactivity which has brought confusion, insecurity.
and suffering to the people. "The Almighty," to whom Ipuwer
directs his words, is a customary appellation of great gods."
Because the introductory passages of the papyrus, where the
author and his listeners would be likely to be mentioned, are
missing, the presence of the king listening to the sage is assumed
on the basis of the preferred form of certain other literary examples
of the Middle Kingdom. In accordance with this interpretation, the
papyrus containing the words of Ipuwer is called, in the Gardiner
edition, Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage.

Egypt in Upheaval
The Papyrus Ipuwer is not a collection of proverbs (Lauth, Chabas)
or riddles (Brugsch); no more is it a literary prophecy (Lange) or an
admonition concerning profound social changes (Gardiner, Sethe ).
It is the Egyptian version of a great catastrophe.
The papyrus is a script of lamentations, a description of ruin and
horror.
PAPYRUS 2:8 Forsooth, the land turns round as does a potter's wheel. 2:11 The
towns are destroyed. Upper Egypt has become dry (wastes?).
3:13 All is ruin!
7:4 The residence is overturned in a minute.
4:2 . . . Years of noise. There is no end to noise.
What do "noise" and "years of noise" denote? The translator
wrote: "There is clearly some play upon the word hrw (noise) here,
the point of which is to us obscure." Does it mean "earthquake"
and "years of earthquake"? In Hebrew the word raash signifies
"noise," "commotion," as well as "earthquake."1 Earthquakes are
often accompanied by loud sounds, subterranean rumbling and
roaring, and this acoustic phenomenon gives the name to the
upheaval itself.
Apparently the shaking returned again and again, and the country
was reduced to ruins, the state went into sudden decline, and life
became unbearable.
Ipuwer says:
PAPYRUS 6:1 Oh, that the earth would cease from noise, and tumult (uproar) be no
more.
The noise and the tumult were produced by the earth. The royal
residence could be overthrown "in a minute" and left in ruins only
by a mighty earthquake. The upheaval seems to have wrought
havoc on the high seas, where ships were thrown into whirlpools;



in the passage where "the towns are destroyed," it is also said that
ships were set adrift.
The papyrus of Ipuwer contains evidence of some natural
cataclysm accompanied by earthquakes and bears witness to the
appearance of things as they happened at that time.
I shall compare some passages from the Book of Exodus and
from the papyrus. As, prior to the publication of Worlds in Collision
and Ages in Chaos, no parallels had been drawn between the Bible
and the text of the Papyrus Ipuwer, the translator of the papyrus
could not have been influenced by a desire to make his translation
resemble the biblical text.2
PAPYRUS 2:5-6 Plague is throughout the land. Blood is everywhere.
EXODUS 7:21 . . . there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. This was the first
plague.
PAPYRUS 2:10 The river is blood.
EXODUS 7:20 . all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
This water was loathsome, and the people could not drink it.
PAPYRUS 2:10 Men shrink Fiona tasting-- human beings, and thirst after water.
EXODUS 7:24 And all the Egyptians Jigged round about the t b,er for water to drink;
for they could not drink of the water of the river.
The fish in the lakes and the river died, and worms, insects, and
reptiles bred prolifically.
EXODUS 7:21 . . . and the river stank.
PAPYRUS 3:10-18 That is our water! That is our happiness! What shall we do in
respect thereof? All is ruin!
The destruction in the fields is related in these words:
EXODUS 9:25 . . . and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of
the field.3
PAPYRUS 4:14 Trees are destroyed. 6:1 No fruit nor herbs are found . . .



This portent was accompanied by consuming fire. Fire spread all
over the land.
EXODUS 9:23-24 . . . the fire ran along upon the ground.
. . . there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous.
PAPYRUS 2:10 Forsooth, gates, columns and walls are consumed by fire.
The fire which consumed the land was not spread by human
hand but fell from the skies.4
By this torrent of destruction, according to Exodus,
EXODUS 9:31-32 . . . the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the
ear, and the flax was boiled.
But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
It was after the next plague that the fields became utterly barren.
Like the Book of Exodus (9:31-32 and 10:15), the papyrus relates
that no duty could be rendered to the crown for wheat and barley;
and as in Exodus 7:21 ("And the fish that was in the river died"),
there was no fish for the royal storehouse.
PAPYRUS 10:3-6 Lower Egypt weeps. . . . The entire palace is without its revenues.
To it belong (by right) wheat and barley, geese and fish.
The fields were entirely devastated.
EXODUS 10:15 . . . there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of
the fields, through all the land of Egypt.
PAPYRUS 6:3 Forsooth, grain has perished on every side.
5:12 Forsooth, that has perished which yesterday was seen. The land is left over to its
weariness like the cutting of flax.
The statement that the crops of the fields were destroyed in a
single day ("which yesterday was seen") excludes drought, the
usual cause of a bad harvest; only hail, fire, or locusts could have
left the fields as though after "the cutting of flax." The plague is
described in Psalms 105:34-35 in these words: ". . . the locusts
came, and caterpillars, and that without number. And did eat up all
the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground."
PAPYRUS 6:1 No fruit nor herbs are found . . . hunger.



The cattle were in a pitiful condition.
EXODUS 9:3 . . . the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field . . .
there shall be a very grievous murrain.
PAPYRUS 5:5 All animals, their hearts weep. Cattle moan. .
Hail and fire made the frightened cattle flee.
EXODUS 9:19 . . . gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field . . .
21 And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the
field.
PAPYRUS 9:2-3 Behold, cattle are left to stray, and there is none to gather them
together. Each man fetches for himself those that arc branded with his name.
The ninth plague, according to the Book of Exodus, covered
Egypt with profound darkness.
EXODUS 10:22 . . . and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt.
PAPYRUS 9:11 The land is not light. .
"Not light" is in Egyptian equivalent to "without light" or "dark."
But there is some question as to whether the two sentences are
entirely parallel. The years of wandering in the desert are described
as spent in gloom under a cover of thick clouds.5 The Jewish
written tradition persists that for a number of years after the Exodus
the light of the sun was dimmed by clouds. It is rather this biblical
"shadow of death" to which the quotation of the papyrus seems to
be parallel. The Egyptian parallel to the plague of impenetrable
darkness will be found on a subsequent page; the "shadow of
death" will also have additional parallels.
1 The other Hebrew word for "noise," shaon, also means "earthquake." See S. Krauss,
"Earthquake," The Jewish Encyclopedia (New York, 1901-6).
2 The Bible quotations are from the King James version; the quotations from the text of the
papyrus arc from the translation by A. 11. Gardiner.
3 In Psalms 105:33 this plague is described: "He smote [with hail] their vines also and their
fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts."

5 Jeremiah 2:6.
The Last Night before the Exodus
According to the Book of Exodus, the last night the Israelites
were in Egypt was a night in which death struck instantly and took
victims from every Egyptian home. The death of so many in a
single night, even at the same hour of midnight, cannot be
explained by a pestilence, which would not strike in many places at
the same moment and would last more than a single hour. The
story of the last plague does seem like a myth; it is a stranger in the
sequence of the other plagues, which can be explained as natural
phenomena.
The plagues have been described here as forerunners of the
catastrophe which reached its climax at the Jam-Suf (the Sea of
Passage); the phenomena in the desert were the subsequent
spasms of the earth's crust. Testimony from Egyptian sources about
an earthquake was sought, with the purpose of establishing a
synchronic moment in Egyptian and Jewish history. The evidence,
when found, brought forth more analogies and showed greater
resemblance to the scriptural narrative than I had expected.
Apparently we have before us the testimony of an Egyptian witness
of the plagues.
On careful reading of the papyrus, it appeared that the slaves
were still in Egypt when at least one great shock occurred, ruining
houses and destroying life and fortune. It precipitated a general
flight of the population from the cities, while the other plagues
probably drove them from the country into the cities.
The biblical testimony was reread. It became evident that it had
not neglected this most conspicuous event: it was the tenth plague.
In the papyrus it is said: "The residence is overturned in a minute."1
On a previous page it was stressed that only an earthquake could
have overturned and ruined the royal residence in a minute.



Sudden and simultaneous death could be inflicted on many only
by a natural catastrophe.
EXODUS 12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all
the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for there was not a house where
there was not one dead.
A great part of the people lost their lives in one violent shock.
Houses were struck a furious blow.
EXODUS 12:27 [The Angel of the Lord] passed over the houses of the children of
Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.
The word nogaf for "smote" is used for a violent blow, e.g., for
thrusting with his horns by an ox.2
The residence of the king and the palaces of the rich were tossed
to the ground, and with them the houses of the common people
and the dungeons of captives.
EXODUS 12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn
in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the
firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon.
PAPYRUS 4:3, also 5:6 Forsooth, the children of princes are dashed against the walls.
6:12 Forsooth, the children of princes are cast out in the streets.
The sight of the children of princes smashed on the pavement of
the dark streets, injured and dead amid the ruins, moved the heart
of the Egyptian eyewitness. No one saw the agony in the dungeon,
a pit in the ground where prisoners were locked in, when it was
filled by landslides.
PAPYRUS 6:3 The prison is ruined.3
Why is this unreasonable "firstborn" inserted in the Hebrew text?
The explanation will follow later.
In the papyrus (2:13) it is written:
He who places his brother in the ground is everywhere.
To it corresponds Exodus ( 12:30):
. . . there was not a house where there was not one dead.



In Exodus ( 12:30) it is written:
. . . there was a great cry in Egypt.
To it corresponds the papyrus ( 3:14):
It is groaning that is throughout the land, mingled with lamentations.
The statues of the gods fell and broke in pieces:4 "this night . . .
against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment" (Exodus
12:12).
A book by Artapanus, no longer extant, which quoted some
unknown ancient source and which in its turn was quoted by
Eusebius, tells of "hail and earthquake by night [of the last plague],
so that those who fled from the earthquake were killed by the hail,
and those who sought shelter from the hail were destroyed by the
earthquake. And at that time all the houses fell in, and most of the
temples."'
The earth was equally pitiless toward the dead in their graves:
the sepulchers opened, and the buried were disentombed.
PAPYRUS 4:4, also 6:14 Forsooth, those who were in the place of embalmment are
laid on the high ground.
A legend is preserved in the Haggada:6 in the last night, when
the land of Egypt was smitten, the coffin of Joseph was found lying
upon the ground, lifted from its grave.
Similar effects of powerful earthquakes have occasionally been
observed in modern times.7
The unborn, Ipuwer mourned, entered into everlasting life ere
they had seen the light of the world.
In Midrash Rabba on Exodus it is written:
Even pregnant women about to give birth miscarried and then them-selves died;
because the Destroyer stalked abroad and destroyed all he found.8

example: "To overthrow a wall."

"Firstborn" or "Chosen"
The biblical story of the last plague has a distinctly supernatural
quality in that all the firstborn and only the firstborn were killed on
the night of the plagues.1 An earthquake that destroys only the
firstborn is inconceivable, because events can never attain that
degree of coincidence. No credit should be given to such a record.
Either the story of the last plague, in its canonized form, is a
fiction, or it conceals a corruption of the text. Before proclaiming
the whole a strange tale interpolated later, it would be wise to
inquire whether or not the incredible part alone is corrupted. It may
be that "the firstborn" stands for some other word.
ISAIAH 43:16 Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the
mighty waters;
:20 . . . I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my
people, my chosen.
In the Book of Exodus it is said that Moses was commanded:
EXODUS 4:22-23 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my
son, even my firstborn.
. . . and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.



The "chosen" are here called "firstborn." If Israel was the
firstborn, revenge was to be taken against Egypt by the death of its
firstborn. But if Israel was the chosen, then revenge was to be taken
against Egypt by the death of its chosen.
"Israel, my chosen," is Israel bechori, or bechori.
"Israel, my firstborn," is Israel bekhori.2
It is the first root which was supposed to determine the relation
between God and his people. Therefore: "at midnight the Lord
smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt" (Exodus 12:29) must
be read "all the select of Egypt," as one would say, "all the flower of
Egypt" or "all the strength of Egypt." "Israel is my chosen: I shall let
fall all the chosen of Egypt."
Natural death would usually choose the weak, the sick, the old.
The earthquake is different; the walls fall upon the strong and the
weak alike. Actually the Midrashim say that "as many as nine
tenths of the inhabitants have perished.3
In Psalms 135 my idea is illustrated by the use of both roots
where two words of the same root would have been expected.
For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. . . .
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt.
In Psalms 78 the history of the Exodus is told once more:
PSALMS 78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt . . .
:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt . . .
52 But made his own people to go forth . . .
:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God . . .
:81 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down
the chosen men of Israel.. . .
Were the firstborn destroyed when the wrath was turned against
Egypt, and were the chosen destroyed when the wrath was turned
against Israel?
AMOS 4:10 I have sent among you the pestilence [plague] after the manner of Egypt:
your young men [chosen] have I slain.



In the days of raash (commotion) during the reign of Uzziah, the
select and the flower of the Jewish people shall perish as perished
the chosen, the strength of Egypt, was the prophecy of Amos.
It is possible that the king's firstborn died on the night of the
upheaval. The death of the prince could have been an outward
reason for changing the text. The intrinsic reason lies in the same
source that interrupted the story of the Exodus at the most exciting
place - after the houses of the Egyptians had crumbled - with these
sentences:
EXODUS 13:2 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb
among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
13 . . . and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
Jeremiah testifies to the fact that burnt offerings and sacrifices
were not ordered on the day Israel left Egypt.
JEREMIAH 7:22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day
that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.
This is in contradiction to the text of Exodus 12:43 to 13:16. To
free the pebple from this bondage is the task of Amos, Isaiah, and
Jeremiah.
AMOS 5:22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not
accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
:24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness us a mighty stream.
:25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, 0
house of Israel?
1 According to the haggadic tradition, not only the firstborn but the majority of the
population in Egypt was killed during the tenth plague.

Revolt and Flight



My endeavor has been to find in Egyptian sources some mention
of a natural catastrophe. The description of disturbances in the
Papyrus Ipuwer, when compared with the scriptural narrative, gives
a strong impression that both sources relate the very same event %
It is therefore only natural to look for mention of revolt among the
population, of a flight of wretched slaves from this country visited
by disaster, and of a cataclysm in which the pharaoh perished.3
Although in the mutilated papyrus there is no explicit reference
to the Israelites or their leaders, three facts are clearly described as
consequences of the upheaval: the population revolted; the
wretched or the poor men fled; the king perished under unusual
circumstances.
If, in addition to the closely parallel description of the plagues, I
should try to extract more than these three facts from the papyrus, I
should expose myself to the charge that I use the defective
condition of the document to support preconceived ideas. But the
references to the catastrophe and to the population that rebelled
and fled are not ambiguous; their meaning is clear and not open to
misunderstanding. Consequently, when, in the next few
paragraphs, I try to uncover additional parallels in certain passages,
I do so with restraint. The papyrus is damaged and obscure in
many places; if one or another comparison is incomplete or
arbitrary, it may add nothing to, but neither does it detract anything
from, the fact established here, that a sequence of earthquakes and
other natural phenomena occurred in Egypt, accompanied by
plagues bringing destruction to men, animals, plants, and sources
of water.
The first omens of an approaching catastrophe brought unrest to
the land, and the captives longed to escape to freedom. The
papyrus narrates that "men ventured to rebel against the Uraeus"
(the emblem of royal authority) and that magical spells connected
with the serpent are divulged (6:6-7 to 7:5-6), that gold and jewels
"are fastened on the neck of female slaves" (3:2-3; compare with
Exodus 11:2: "and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every
woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold . . .").



The collapse of stone structures, the dead and wounded in the
debris, the fall of many statues of the gods, inspired dread and
horror; all these were looked upon as the acts of the God of the
slaves.
EXODUS 12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.
The Egyptians were to use still bitterer words; when the calamity
was repeated, they no longer expressed anguish and fear of death,
but invoked it in passages such as these:
PAPYRUS 4:2 Forsooth, great and small say: I wish I might die. 5:14f. Would that
there might be an end of men, no conception, no birth! Oh, that the earth would cease
from noise, and tumult be no more!
The following lines speak of a population escaping a disaster.
"Men flee. . . . Tents are what they make like the dwellers of the
hills" (Papyrus 10:2). In the Book of Exodus it is said that the
Israelites left the country "in haste" (Exodus 12:33) and "could not
tarry" ( 12:39). No doubt flight and living in makeshift tents was
shared by the majority of the survivors, as has happened many
times since then whenever a violent shock has occurred,
devastating cities; a new shock is feared by those who have
escaped with their lives.
A "mixed multitude" of Egyptians joined the Israelite slaves, and
with them hastily made toward the desert (Exodus 12:38). Their
first brief stop was at Succoth (13:20 ) - which in Hebrew means
"huts."
The escaped slaves hurried across the border of the country. By
day a column of smoke went before them in the sky; by night it
was a pillar of fire.
EXODUS 13:21 . . . by day in a pillar of a cloud, to load them the way; and by night
in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night.
PAPYRUS 7:1 Behold, the fire has mounted up on high. Its burning goes forth
against the enemies of the land.



The translator added this remark: "Here the 'fire' is regarded as
something disastrous."
After the first manifestations of the protracted cataclysm the
Egyptians tried to bring order into the land. They traced trae route
of the escaped slaves. The wanderers became "entangled in the
land, the wilderness hath shut them in" (Exodus 14:3). They turned
to the sea, they stood at Pi-ha-Khiroth. "The Egyptians pursued
after them. The Egyptians marched after them." A hurricane blew
all the night and the sea fled.
In a great avalanche of water "the sea returned to his strength,"
and "the Egyptians fled against it." The sea engulfed the chariots
and the horsemen, the pharaoh and all his host.
The Papyrus Ipuwer (7:1-2) records only that the pharaoh was
lost under unusual circumstances "that have never happened
before." The Egyptian wrote his lamentations, and even in the
broken lines they are perceptible:
. . . weep . . the earth is . . . on every side . . . weep . . .
The Hyksos Invade Egypt
There was no longer any royal power in Egypt. In the following
weeks the cities turned into scenes of looting. Justice ceased to
function. The mob dug in the debris and in the public records,
where contracts, notes and pledges, and deeds to real property
were filed. The plunderers searched among the wreckage of the
royal storehouses.
PAPYRUS 6:9 Forsooth, the laws of the judgment-hall are cast forth. Men walk upon
[them] in the public places.
10:3 The storehouse of the king is the common property of everyone.
The papyrus furnishes information as to what happened after
wards. The earth's crust repeatedly contracted in violent spasms
("years of noise"). The roads became impassable - "dragged" and
"flooded" (Papyrus 12:11f.). The realm was depopulated, and
Ipuwer bewails the "lack of people." The residence of the pharaoh



was a heap of .ruins. Governmental authority was completely
shattered. "Behold, the chiefs of the land flee" (8:14); "Behold, no
offices are in their (right) place, like a frightened herd without a
herdsman" (9:2). The "poor men" who ran away roamed the
desert. Slaves who remained in Egypt raised their heads.
6;7 Forsooth, public offices are opened and their census lists are taken away
Then invaders approached out of the gloom of the desert; they
crossed the borders and entered the shattered land.
PAPYRUS 3:1 Forsooth, the Desert is throughout the land. The nomes are laid waste.
A foreign tribe from abroad has come to Egypt.
The catastrophe that rendered Egypt defenseless was a signal to
the tribes of the Arabian desert.
PAPYRUS 15:1 What has happened? - through it is to cause the Asiatics to know the
condition of the land.
14:11 Men - They have come to an end for themselves. There are none found to stand
and protect themselves.
Prostrated by the appalling blows of nature, the Egyptians did
not defend themselves. It is not clear whether "a million of people"
in the next sentence is the number of the perished or of the
intruders.
PAPYRUS 12:6ff. Today fear - more than a million of people. Not seen - enemies
enter into the temples - weep.
To all the previous plagues this was added: pillagers completed
the destruction, killing and raping.
The double catastrophe - caused by nature and by the invasion
destroyed all class distinction and brought about a social
revolution. "Behold, noble ladies go hungry." "Behold, he who slept
without a wife through want finds precious things." "He who passed
the night in squalor" raised his head. "She who looked at her face
in the water is possessor of a mirror."
It was anarchy. Nobody worked. "Behold, no craftsmen work."
"A man strikes his brother, the son of his mother." "Men sit [behind]



the bushes until the benighted ( traveler) comes, in order to
plunder his burden." "Behold, one uses violence against another. . .
. If three men journey upon a road, they arc found to be two men;
the greater number slay the less. . . . The land is as a weed that
destroys men."
"How terrible it is. What am I to do?" laments Ipuwer. "Woe is me
because of the misery in this time!"
Several expressions of Ipuwer indicate that the text of the
papyrus was composed shortly after the major catastrophe; the
aftermath and the subsequent disturbances of nature were not yet
at their end.
The starting point of this research was this: the Exodus from
Egypt took place at the time of a great natural catastrophe. In order
to find the time of the Exodus in Egyptian history, we had to search
for some record of catastrophe in the physical world. This record is
contained in the Papyrus Ipuwer.
Many parts of the papyrus are missing. The beginning and the
end, doubtless containing details, possibly names, are destroyed.
But what is preserved is sufficient to impress us with this fact:
before us is not merely the story of a catastrophe, but an Egyptian
version of the plagues.
It was surprising to find in the papyrus, in addition to the story of
"dwellers in marshes" and "poor men" who fled the land scourged
by plagues, laments about the invaders, who came from the desert
of Asia, preyed on the disorganized country, and became its violent
oppressors. Amu or the Hyksos were the invaders who ruled Egypt
during the centuries that separate the period of the Middle
Kingdom from that of the New Kingdom. In a subsequent section
the divergent views on the date of origin of the papyrus of Ipuwer
will be presented.
Pi-ha-Khiroth



In the sixties of the last century, in el-Arish, a town on the border
between Egypt and Palestine, the attention of a traveler1 . was
attracted to a shrine (naos) of black granite inscribed with
hieroglyphics over all its surfaces. It was used by the Arabs of the
locality as a cattle trough. An account of this shrine and a partial
translation of the text were published in 1890;2 the shrine was still
being used as a trough. Sometime during the present century the
stone was brought to the Museum of Ismailia and a new attempt to
translate the text was undertaken.3
Since its discovery, the monolith of el-Arish has been men.
Honed only infrequently, and its strange text has been regarded as
rather mythological, though kings, residences, and geographical
places are named and an invasion of foreigners described. The
names of deities appearing in the text are royal cognomens. The
inscription is of the Ptolemaic or Hellenistic age, but the events
related are of a much earlier period, that of King Thom and his
successor. In this inscription the name of King Thom is written in a
royal car-touche, a fact that points to the historical background of
the text.
The text, as will be demonstrated, deserves attentive study and a
new definitive translation. Not even the sequence of the text is
conclusively established.
In the mutilated text there are these lines:
The land was in great affliction. Evil fell on this earth. . . . It was a great upheaval in
the residence. . . . Nobody left the palace during nine days, and during these nine days
of upheaval there was such a tempest that neither the men nor the gods could see the
faces of their next.
Similar mention of a darkness that lasted a number of days, that
confined everyone to his place, that was accompanied by a great
upheaval, and that was so complete that no one could discern the
face of his neighbor, is found in the Book of Exodus in the story of
the ninth plague.
EXODUS 10:22-23 . . . and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three
days. They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days.



The Egyptian text differs from the Hebrew in that it numbers
nine days of darkness4 A strong wind is mentioned in the Scriptures
in connection with the removal of the preceding plague - the
locusts. They were brought by the "east wind" and "covered the
face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened" ( Exodus
10:13ff. ), and they were removed by "a mighty strong west wind":
EXODUS 10:19 And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea.
Immediately thereafter came the ninth plague - the thick dark
ness.
In the story of the darkness in Egypt, as told in old Midrash
books, additional details are given. The plague of darkness
endured seven days. During the first three days one could still
change his
position; during the next three days one could not stir from his
place. The rabbinical sources so describing the calamity 'of
darkness are numerous.5 Josephus Flavius6 and Philo the
AlexandrianT of the first century of the present era also belong to
what may be called rabbinical sources. The collation of this
material presents the following picture:
. . . exceeding strong west wind . . . endured seven days. All the time the land was
enveloped in darkness. . . . The darkness was of such a nature that it could not be
dispelled by artificial means. The light of the fire . . . was either extinguished by the
violence of the storm, or else it was made invisible and swallowed up in the density of
the darkness. . . .
None was able to speak or to hear, nor could anyone venture to take food, but they
lay themselves down . . . their outward senses in ' a trance. Thus they remained,
overwhelmed by the affliction. . . .8
The last, the seventh day of darkness, overtook the land when
the Israelites were at the Sea of Passage.9 In the Book of Exodus it
is said that "it was a cloud and darkness" so that the camp of the
Egyptians came not near the camp of the Israelites "all the night."
"And the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all
that night."



Tradition puts the time from the tenth plague, which followed
immediately the plague of darkness, until the passage of the sea at
six days and a few hours. The Exodus that followed the night of the
tenth plague is commemorated on the first day of Passover
(fifteenth day of Nisan), and the passage of the sea on the last, the
seventh day of Passover (twenty-first day of Nisan ).
The Hebrew version of the plague of darkness is not unlike the
Egyptian version; it was not the darkness of a quiet night - a violent
storm rushed in fine ashes. "The darkness came from the hell and
could be felt."10 In the tempest and darkness that lasted for days
and nights, it was difficult to measure time; men, overwhelmed by
misfortune, were bereft of exact judgment of the passage of time.
Under such circumstances the slight discrepancy between the text
on the stone (nine days11 of darkness) and the tradition of the
Midrashim (seven days of darkness) is negligible.
The Hebrew sources tell that cities were devastated in the
darkness and that many Israelites were among the dead from the
ninth plague.12 The land fell into distress and ruin.
"Evil fell upon this earth . . . the earth is in a great affliction . . . a
great disturbance in the residence," are passages on the shrine
describing the nine days of darkness and tempest when nobody
could see anything and none could leave the palace.
In the midst of the savageries of nature "his majesty of Shou"
assembled his hosts and ordered them to follow him to regions
where, he promised, they would again. see light: "We shall see our
father Ra-Harakhti in the luminous region of Bakhit."
Under cover of darkness intruders from the desert approached
the border of Egypt. ". . . his majesty of Shou went to battle against
the companions of Apopi." Apopi was the fierce god of darkness.
The king and his hosts never returned; they perished.
Now when the majesty of Ra-Harmachis [Haralkhti?] fought with
the evil-doers in this pool, the Place of the Whirlpool, the evil-doers
prevailed not over his majesty. His majesty leapt into the so-called
Place of the Whirlpool.13



And in the Book of Exodus it is related:
EXODUS 14:27-28 . . . the sea returned to his strength . . . and the Egyptians fled
against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host
of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them.
Pharaoh himself perished too:
EXODUS 15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them.
The story of the darkness in Egypt as told in Hebrew and
Egyptian sources is very similar. The death of the pharaoh in the
whirling waters is also similar in both Hebrew and Egyptian
sources, and the value of this similarity is enhanced by the fact that
in both versions the pharaoh perished in a whirlpool during or after
the days of the great darkness and violent hurricane.
And yet even a striking similarity is not identity. The subject of
the two records should be regarded as identical only if some detail
can be found in both versions, the Hebrew and the Egyptian, that
cannot be attributed to chance.
The march of the pharaoh with his hosts is related amidst the
description of the great upheaval in the residence and the tempest
that made the land dark. He arrived at a place designated by
name:
His Majesty - [here words are missing] finds on this place called Pi-Kharoti.
A few lines later it is said that he was thrown by a great force. He
was thrown by the whirlpool high in the air. He departed to
heaven. He was no longer alive.
The explanation of the translator of the text concerning this
geographical designation "Pi-Kharoti" is: ". . . is not known except
in this example!"14
Here attempted identification of the subject of the two versions,
the Hebrew and the Egyptian, is not incorrect if the locality where
the pharaoh perished was a place by the Sea of Passage.



EXODUS 14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all, the horses and chariots of
Pharaoh . . . and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-ha-hiroth [Khiroth].
Pi-Kharoti is Pi-Khiroth of the Hebrew text.15 It is the same place.
It is the same pursuit. It is erroneous to say that the name is met
nowhere else except on the shrine.
The inscription on the shrine relates that after a time a son of the
pharaoh, "his majesty Geb," set out himself. "He asks information. .
. ." The eyewitnesses from neighboring abodes "give him the
information about all that happened to Ra in Yat Nebes, the
combats of the king Thoum."
All who accompanied the prince were killed by a terrible blast,
and the prince, "his majesty Geb," sustained burns before he re
turned from his expedition to seek his father, who had perished.
Invaders approaching by way of Yat Nebes came in the gloom
and overpowered Egypt. "The children of Apopi, the rebels that arc
at Ousherou [not identified, has a sign "dry," meaning "desert"] and
in the desert, they approached by way of Yat Nebes, and fell upon
Egypt at the fall of darkness. They conquered only to destroy. . . .
These rebels, they came from the mountains of the Orient by all
the ways of Yat Nebes."16
The prince retreated before the invaders. He did not return to
Heliopolis: "He did not go to On with [or "like] the companions of
the thieves of the scepter"; he was robbed of his heritage. He
secluded himself in the provincial residence of Hy-Taoui "in the
land of the plants henou." From there he made an attempt, entirely
unsuccessful, to communicate with "the foreigners and the Amu,"
that they leave the country. In his helplessness he recalled how his
father, who succumbed in the whirlpool, in better days had battled
all the rebels and "massacred the children of Apopi."
After a time "the air cooled off, and the countries dried."
It is not known what happened to the unhappy prince. His end
was certainly sad. Egypt was devastated by the tempest and
scorched by fire. The residence was seized by the Amu.



The inscription on the shrine at el-Arish says that the name of
the pharaoh who perished in the whirlpool was Thom or Thoum. It
is of interest that Pi-Thom means "the abode of Thom." Pithom was
one of the two cities built by the Israelite slaves for the Pharaoh of
Oppression.17 In Manetho, the pharaoh in whose days the "blast of
heavenly displeasure" fell upon Egypt, preceding the invasion of
the Hyksos, is called Tutimaeus or Timaios.18
The question, centuries or even millennia old, as to where the
Sea of Passage was, can be solved with the help of the inscription
on the shrine. On the basis of certain indications in the text, Pi
haKhiroth, where the events took place, was on the way from
Memphis to Pisoped.19

15 "Ha" in Pi-ha-Klairoth is the Hebrew definite article. It belongs between Pi and Khiroth.
The vowels in the translation of the Egyptian text are a conjecture of the translator: the
name can also be read Pi-Khirot.

17 The 'treasury city of Pithom was discovered by E. Naville in 1885 at Tell el Maskhuta,
and identified with the help of an inscription.
The name of the other city, Ramses, was largely the reason why Ramses II of the
Nineteenth Dynasty was identified as the Pharaoh of Oppression. It is well to remember
that "second" is our modern reckoning of kings, and Ramses of the Nineteenth Dynasty
may have had some predecessors of the same name in pre-Hyksos dynasties. Ramses
could also be a city named for a divinity. It is also possible that the name of the city Ramses
(Exodus 12:37) is a later name of the place; similarly we call by the name Tell el-Amarna
the historical Akhet-Atop. The argument of the Ramses city was sometimes raised against
the identification of the Habiru with the Israelites.

The Ermitage Papyrus
A papyrus text preserved in the Ermitage in Leningrad and listed in
the catalogue of that museum as "number 1116b recto,1 is a literary
echo of fateful days when the empire of Egypt perished and the
land fell prey to invading nomads. In this papyrus the same story is
related that we now know from the Papyrus Ipuwer, but in a
different way. The upheavals of nature and the subsequent
subjugation of Egypt by the desert tribes are recounted, not as
events in the past or present, but as things that are to come.
Obviously this indicates only a preference for the literary form of
foretelling.
A sage by the name of Neferrohu asks his royal listener whether
he would like to hear about things past or things future. "Said his
majesty: Nay, of things future." The seer "was brooding over what



should come to pass in the land and conjuring up the condition of
the East, when the Asiatics [Amu] approach in their might and their
hearts rage. . . . And he said: `Up my heart and bewail this land
thou art sprung."
"The land is utterly perished and nought remains. Perished is this
land. . . . The sun is veiled and shines not in the sight of men.
None can live when the sun is veiled by clouds. . . ." "The river is
dry (even the river) of Egypt." "The South Wind shall blow against
the North Wind." "The earth is fallen into misery . . . Bedouins
pervade the land. For foes are in the East [side of sun rising] and
Asiatics shall descend into Egypt." "The beasts of the desert shall
drink from the rivers of Egypt. . . . This land shall be in
perturbation. . . ." "I show thee the land upside down, happened
that which never (yet) had happened. . . ." "Men laugh with the
laughter of pain. None there is who weepeth because of death."
"None knoweth that midday is there; his [sun's] shadow is not
discerned. Not dazzled is the sight when he is beheld. . . . He is in
the sky like the moon. . . ."
From the description of the changes in nature we can recognize
them as belonging to the period when the Israelites roamed in the
desert, under a cloudy sky, in "the land of shadow, shadow of
death.2 Jeremiah centuries later complained: "Neither said they,
Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that
led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits,
through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death . . . ?" (2:6.)
In numerous other passages in the Scriptures this "shadow of
death" is mentioned: during the years of wandering in the desert
the sky was veiled, clouds hung over the desert;3 all life processes
were impaired, and for this reason the gloom was called "shadow
of death." The plague of darkness, of which, I maintain, the
"shadow of death" was a lasting remainder, is dealt with in Worlds
in Collision, which investigates the physical side of the catastrophe.
After giving this picture of natural disaster combined with the
political subjugation of Egypt by the Amu, the seer Neferrohu
prophesied the liberation by a king who would be born of a



Nubian woman and called Ameny - "the Amu shall fall by his
sword." Thereafter "there shall be built the 'Wall of the Prince' so as
not to allow the Amu to go down into Egypt."
It is questionable whether Ameny is a historical personality.
Because of some surmise as to his identity, the papyrus was
supposed to have been written during the Old Kingdom or shortly
after its end; it is also apparent that this text has much in common
with the text of the papyrus in Leiden. However, the Hyksos (Amu)
period in Egypt followed the end of the Middle Kingdom. The
name Ameny may refer to Amenhotep I, one of the first kings of
Egypt after it was freed from the Hyksos; at the time of liberation
he was a prince. He is usually pictured as black,4 which would also
conform with the words "born of a Nubian woman." He was highly
revered in later times.
A literary remnant that closely resembles the Ermitage papyrus
1116b recto is a prophecy of a potter under King Amenophis
[Amenhotep]. "The waterless Nile will be filled, the displaced winter
will come in its own season. The sun will resume its course and the
winds will be restrained. For in the Typhon time the sun is veiled."
This prophecy is preserved in a papyrus written in Greek, being a
translation of an older Egyptian text.5 The pharaoh's name points
to one of the Amenhoteps of the New Kingdom6 and, I assume,
refers to the same Ameny or Amenhotep I.

3 A thick veil of clouds over the desert is mentioned repeatedly in the Scriptures and in the
Talmud and Midrashim.

saint.

Two Questions
There are two questions that demand an answer.
The first is: 'What were the nature and dimensions of this
catastrophe, or this series of catastrophes, accompanied by
plagues, about which we have now very similar scriptural and
Egyptian testimony? In the next chapter we shall also have the
corroborating autochthonous tradition of the Arabian peninsula. A
reply to this question involves a study, not only of history, but also
of many other fields. A work comprising an investigation into the
nature of great catastrophes of the past preceded this volume.
Leaving aside here the problem of the extent and character of
the catastrophe, we turn to the other question: When did the
upheaval occur? In Jewish history the answer is at hand: in the
days of the Exodus. As for Egyptian history, we must first find out
when the text of the Papyrus Ipuwer originated.
Scholars who have studied this papyrus agree that the document
is a copy of a still older papyrus: "The scribe used a manuscript a
few centuries older."1 . The copy was made sometime during the
Nineteenth Dynasty, but "The spelling is, on the whole, that of a
literary text of the Middle Kingdom, if this term be interpreted in a
very liberal way.2
The question, When did the text originate? grows in importance
in view of the parallels with the Book of Exodus presented here.
It was understood that the question of the age of the text "is
inextricably bound up with the problem as to the historical situation
that the author [Ipuwer] had in his mind."3 "The text tells both of
civil war and of an Asiatic occupation of the Delta." "There are two
periods which might possibly answer the requirement of the case:
the one is the dark age that separates the sixth from the eleventh
dynasty [or the Old Kingdom from the Middle Kingdom]; the other
is the Hyksos period [between the Middle and the New
Kingdoms]." The opinions of the papyrologists (Gardiner and
Sethe) were divided on the question, To which of these periods



does the text of the papyrus relate? There is no definite knowledge
of any invasion by Asiatics (Amu) during the first period - that
between the Old Kingdom and the Middle Kingdom - and to
conform with the historical background of the papyrus, such an
invasion at that time must be first postulated with the help of the
papyrus.4 "There is no such difficulty in the view preferred by
Sethe," who maintained that the time described is that of the
invasion of the Hyksos, Gardiner conceded and added: "The view
that our Leiden papyrus contains allusion to the Hyksos has the
better support from the historical standpoint." But a philological
consideration "makes us wish to put back the date of the
composition as far as possible." The language was found beyond
doubt to be not of the New Kingdom but of an earlier time. The
text also contains some references to the establishment of "Great
Houses" (law courts), which became obsolete "in or soon after the
Middle Kingdom."
We should remember that these Great Houses are described in
the papyrus as fallen down and trodden upon by the throngs who
dug in the ruins. This mention, it seems to me, points even more
precisely to the time when the Middle Kingdom collapsed, and the
papyrus should not, on the basis of it, be interpreted as a literary
document composed in pre-Hyksos times. From the standpoint of
style and language, Gardiner admitted, "it is of course possible that
our text may have been composed while the Hyksos were still in
the land."
The discussion of whether the text describes the period between
the Old and Middle Kingdoms, or between the Middle and New
Kingdoms, was closed by the supporter of the first view with this
remark: "It is doubtless wisest to leave the question open for the
present."
I take up the question. The historical background is that of the
invasion of the Hyksos ( Sethe). Philological considerations show
that the text has all the signs of a literary product of the Middle
Kingdom (Gardiner) ).5 When the historical and philological proofs
are combined, all point to the end of the Middle Kingdom and the



very beginning of the invasion of the Hyksos. The style would still
be, of course, that of the Middle Kingdom, because in the few
months since the end of this great age no change in the language
and form of poetic works could have occurred. In the centuries of
domination by the Hyksos literary activity ceased in Egypt.
Besides, it is obvious that Ipuwer bewails the tragedy of his own
time and not of a past age.
In the dispute between Gardiner and Sethe, Gardiner is right in
his philological arguments that the latest period from which the text
could have originated is the time of the Hyksos. However, he is
mistaken in assuming that the text describes events of the dark
period between the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Sethe is right
in the historical argument that the events described are those of the
invasion of the Hyksos after the fall of the Middle Kingdom. On the
other hand, Sethe is mistaken when he ascribes the composition of
the text to the New Kingdom. It was composed immediately after
the fall of the Middle Kingdom, at the very beginning of the Hyksos
period. The historical arguments as well as the philological
arguments are in harmony with this solution.
Those who have tried to place the Exodus in the sequence of
Egyptian history have not dared to set it as far back as between the
Middle and New Kingdoms (time of the Hyksos), and of course not
as far back as between the Old and the Middle Kingdoms.
Not only is the invasion of the Amu (Hyksos) the historical
background of the Admonitions; so are the physical catastrophe
and the plagues, and these are analogous to those of the time of
the Exodus. On this basis, too, there can be no doubt that the
earlier date - between the Old and Middle Kingdoms - is out of the
question; and even the later one is embarrassing enough, for it
appears to be too early for the Exodus.
Is there any physical evidence known which would indicate that
some major change occurred in the geologic structure of Egypt at
some point of time following the Middle Kingdom?



Lepsius has observed the remarkable fact that the Nilometers at
Semneh dating from the Middle Kingdom show an average rise in
the waters of the Nile at that place, where the river is channeled in
rock, twenty-two feet higher than the highest level of today.6
Theoretically the dropping of the water level by twenty-two feet
must be ascribed either to a change in the quantity of water in the
Nile since the Middle Kingdom or to a change in the rock structure
of Egypt.7 If the Nile had contained so much more water before the
catastrophe, many residences and temples would have been
regularly covered with water. Apparently the Nilometers at Semneh
indicate that some violent changes in the rock formation of Egypt
took place at the end of the Middle Kingdom or later_
The Middle Minoan II Age, which is the period of the Cretan
culture, coeval with the Middle Kingdom in Egypt, also came to a
close in a terrible natural catastrophe, as the excavations at
Knossos revea1.8
There exists an important Egyptian inscription of the Queen
Hatshepsut, who came to power two or three generations after,the
expulsion of the Hyksos, in which it is written:
The abode of the Mistress of Qes was fallen in ruin, the earth has swallowed her
beautiful sanctuary and children played over her temple. . . . I cleared and rebuilt it
anew. . . . I restored that which was in ruins, and I completed that which was left
unfinished. For there had been Amu in the midst of the Delta and in Hauar (Auaris),
and the foreign hordes of their number had destroyed the ancient works; they reigned
ignorant of the god Ra.9
These lines contain an inference that temples were swallowed in
the ground10 and that the Hyksos (Amu), who took possession of
the country, did not care to restore the ruins and even added to the
destruction. The Hyksos destroyed, but they did not bury buildings
in the ground. "Does this mean that the temple disappeared in an
earthquake?"11
In all three Egyptian documents quoted - the papyrus of Leiden,
the writings on the shrine of el-Arish, and the papyrus of Ermitage
and also in the inscription of Hatshepsut, the natural catastrophe
and the invasion of the Amu are described as one following the



other; and as the natural catastrophe consisted of a series of
upheavals and disturbances, the invasion of the people from Asia
occurred before the elements calmed.
At various times since the days of antiquity several authors have
identified the Israelites with the Hyksos (Amu); other authors have
placed the arrival of the Israelites in the period of the Hyksos rule
in Egypt and the Exodus of the Israelites in the reign of one of the
kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The majority of scholars, however,
think that the sojourn of the Israelites took place in a still later
period. They relate the coming of the Israelites to some point of
time during the Eighteenth Dynasty, and place the period of
oppression in the days of Ramses II of the Nineteenth Dynasty and
the Exodus in the days of his successor Merneptah.
I have arrived at a very different result. The Israelites left Egypt
amid the outbreak of a great natural catastrophe. The Amu, who
invaded Egypt and became the masters of the land immediately
afterward, were obviously not the Israelites. The tradition of the
Israelites definitely connects their departure from Egypt with the
days when earth, sky, and sea excelled in wrath and destruction,
but knows nothing of their arrival in Egypt in the days of a
cataclysm.
"The dwellers of the marshes" or "the poor men" left the country
under these very circumstances; they must have been the Israelites
and the multitude of the Egyptians who accompanied them in the
Exodus.12 The Amu-Hyksos reached the land of Egypt, upon
which they came to prey, a short time after the catastrophe.
If the above parallels and these conclusions are correct, then: the
Exodus of the Israelites preceded by a few days or weeks the
invasion of the Hyksos.

2 Ibid.,p. 2.
3 Ibid., p. 17.
4 In this case "Amu" would designate not only the Hyksos people, bur Asiatics generally.



5 Both Seale and Gardiner regarded the text as not contemporaneous with the events
described, but in discussing the age of the text, Sethe saw in it a serialisation of the events
of the Hyksos period and considered the beginning of the Now Kingdom as the time of the
composition; Gardiner thought the Middle Kingdom, or perhaps the Hyksos period, was
the time of the composition.
6 Lepsius, Letters from Egypt, Ethiopia and the Peninsula of Sinai, pp. 19-20: "Semneh.
The Nile is here compressed within a breadth of only about 1150 feet between high rocky
shores. . . . We found a considerable number of inscriptions from the Twelfth and
Thirteenth Manethonic Dynasties. . . . Many of them were intended to indicate the highest
rising of the Nile during a series of years, especially in the reigns of the Sings Amenemhet
and Sebekhotep I, and by comparing them, we obtained the remarkable result, that about
4000 years ago the Nile used to rise at that point, on an average, twenty-two feet higher
than it does at present."

Exodus [2nd ed.; London, 1885] ) is the site mentioned in the Book of Exodus, excavation
into deeper strata (Naville explored the level of the Nineteenth Dynasty, as he referred the
Exodus to that time) may show whether or not this Midrash account is legendary.
In general, the swallowing up of cities and villages in earthquakes is authenticated.

Chapter II
THE HYKSOS
Who Were the Hyksos?
THE Egyptian historian Manetho, who lived in the Ptolemaic age,
is our main source of information on the invasion of the Hyksos.
His history of Egypt is not extant, but some passages dealing with
that invasion are preserved by Josephus Flavius, Eusebius, and
Sextus Julius Africanus.1
Josephus, in his pamphlet, Against Apion, preserved more of the
second book of Manetho's history of Egypt than Eusebius and
Africanus did. Here is the first passage:
I will quote his [Manetho's] own words, just as if I had produced
the man himself in the witness box:
"Tutimaeus. In his reign, I know not why, a blast of God's displeasure broke upon us."
"A people of ignoble origin from the east, whose coming was unforeseen, had the
audacity to invade the country, which they mastered by main force without difficulty or
even a battle.2
From where did the Hyksos come? The theories of the scholars
differ. Some thought that the Hyksos were Mitannians, of the Aryan
race;3 others, that they were Scythians.4 Still others, for two
millennia, have supposed that they were the Israelites, whose
sojourn in Egypt is preserved in quite a different version in the
Bible. And, finally, even the very fact of the invasion of Egypt by a
tribe called Hyksos was disputed by a scholar who expended more
effort than others in the investigation of the remnants of the so
called Hyksos dynasties in Egypt.5 However, he found no
followers.



Already in the days of Manetho the land of their origin was not
known with certainty; but this he did know: "Some say that they
were Arabians.6
Manetho, who wrote in Greek, explained their being named
Hyksos:
Their race bore the generic name of Hyksos [Hyksos], which means "king-shepherds."
For Hyc in the sacred language denotes "king," and sos in the common dialect means
"shepherd" or "shepherds"; the combined words form "Hyksos."7
As already noted on a previous page, in the remnants of
Egyptian literature the Hyksos are called "Amu."
The Hyksos were a people imbued to the core with a spirit of
destruction. As far as is known, no monuments of any historical or
artistic value were erected under their rule, no literary works
survived their dominion in Egypt, with the exception of
lamentations, such as those contained in the Ipuwer papyrus. The
memory of the wickedness of these nomads is preserved by
Manetho-Josephus.8
The Scriptures furnish no information about what happened in
Egypt after the Israelites departed. In the midst of a natural
upheaval and a holocaust they left.
The papyrus of Ipuwer completes the records: it tells of invaders
that vexed and tormented the land of Egypt. The tenth plague was
not the last; yet one more was to follow. A cruel conqueror invaded
the once mighty realm, now overthrown and prostrate; he
subjugated it without meeting resistance; he desecrated its sacred
places; he raped its surviving women, enslaved the decimated
population. He utterly destroyed the temples, if any remained
erect, robbed the sepulchres of the dead, and mutilated the victims
who remained alive.
We read the complaint of one of those who escaped alive the
fury of the trembling earth and who witnessed the misery inflicted
by a fierce foe. By comparing the evidence of the Book of Exodus
and that of the Ipuwer papyrus it becomes clear that this eleventh



plague followed the preceding ones when the Israelites were
already out of the country, but only a very short time after their
departure. The Israelites left the land that lay devastated under the
blows from heaven. Another people - called Amu by the Egyptians
- overran the country and turned its exhaustion to their advantage.
The upheaval was not yet over, was still in progress, when Egypt
was invaded by the Amu.
The invaders came from Asia; this is stated in the Ipuwer
papyrus. The Israelites went in the direction of Asia. The two
continents, Asia and Africa, are connected by a small, triangular
piece of land. There was a good chance that the Israelites, moving
toward Asia, would meet the Amu invaders moving toward the
Egyptian frontier. Did they meet each other?
They really met.

The Israelites Meet the Hyksos
Even before the Israelites reached Mount Sinai they met the
multitudes of Amalek. At Meriba, which is at the foot of Horeb,
where the people thirsted for water, in the bed of a stony valley
"came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim" (Exodus 17:8).



Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill and prayed
there when Joshua fought with Amalek. At some stages of the
battle Amalek had the upper hand, but
EXODUS 17:13-16 . . . Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
the sword.
And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book . . . for I will utterly
put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi: For he said, Because
the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to
generation.
The rabbinic tradition says that in this encounter Joshua faced
four hundred thousand Amalekite warriors.1
The victory at Rephidim was costly: in that battle the'lsraelites
prevailed only after they had been hard pressed and were close to
defeat.
This was but one of the battles with the Amalekites. Soon the
Israelites, escaping from Egypt, came upon them in every direction
they chose to go. The tribes of the desert, migrating in large bands
toward Syria and Egypt, continually involved the wanderers in
minor skirmishes, night raids, and irregular engagements. Suffering
from lack of water in a desert covered with dust and ashes, the
Israelites were plagued by the merciless despoilers, who pillaged
and plundered like pirates.
The upheaval at the sea, says the Haggada, had created alarm
among the heathen, and none would oppose the Israelites. But this
fear vanished when the Amalekites attacked them.2
The southern approach to Canaan was closed to the Israelites.
"The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south" (Numbers 13:29).
The people in the wilderness heard this message from the twelve
men when they returned from their mission to investigate Canaan.
"To intensify to the utmost," says the Midrash,3 "their fear of the
inhabitants of Palestine, the scouts said: 'The Amalekites dwell in
the land of the south.' The statement concerning Amalek was



founded on fact, for although southern Palestine had not originally
been their home, still they had recently settled there."
The people to whom this message was brought by the twelve
men "wept that night" (Numbers 14:1): "Would Cod that we had
died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this
wilderness!" ( 14: 2. )
To inspire this boundless fear, the Amalekites must have been
not mere bands of Bedouin robbers but a force superior to other
peoples in the area.
At first Moses charged the Israelites to try to break through into
Canaan across its southern border, but they were afraid and
threatened to stone their leader. Then came the condemnation:
"Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers,"
and they were doomed to wander forty years in the wilderness.
And it was said to them:
NUMBERS 14:25 Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.
Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
The desert with its dreadful experiences - earthquakes, cleavage
of the earth, outbursts of flame, disappearance of springs - terrified
the Israelites. A plague killed thousands, the flesh of wild fowl in
their teeth. These were quail, put to flight like the Israelites who fled
from Egypt, the Amalekites from Arabia, and the wild beasts that
fled to the domicile of man, and the locusts that were flung by the
wind into the Red Sea. The human abode and the lair of the wild
beast and the nest of the fowl became unsafe, and a mighty roving
instinct awoke simultaneously in all of them. The Israelites
wandered toward Canaan, their ancestral home, and were disheart
ened when faced with the choice of battling the Amalekites or
going into the wilderness. A life as wanderers in that desolate
region terrified them, and in desperation they decided to battle
their way through. And now Moses said:
NUMBERS 14:42-45 Co not up, for the Lord is not among you. . . . For the
Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword. . . .
But they presumed to go up. . . .



Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill [
country), and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.
It was the second battle between the Israelites and the
Amalekites.
The above remark in the Midrash that southern Palestine was not
originally the home of the Amalekites and that they had only
recently occupied that area draws our attention. The Amalekites
evidently had conquered the south of Palestine only a short time
before, because the arrivals from Egypt were not aware of their
presence in that region. In the course of their migration the
Amalekites apparently divided and turned simultaneously toward
Egypt and toward the south of Palestine.
Because of the Amalekites the Israelites were compelled to roam
the desert for a whole generation.
At this point, before introducing the entire body of evidence from
Hebrew and Egyptian sources to establish the cardinal point of the
identity of the Hyksos and the Amalekites, I shall ask a question. If
the Hyksos really came from Arabia, might not some evidence of
this fact be found in Arabian sources also?
The old Arabian writings, when investigated, provided the
desired evidence. I shall therefore proceed to compare the three
sources: the Egyptian, the Hebrew, and the Arabian.
The Amalekites were an old Arabian tribe who, from ancient
days, dominated Arabia. In the Book of Genesis, in a genealogical
table, Amalek is said to have been an offspring of Eliphaz, son of
Esau, Isaac's son.4 But obviously this statement does not refer to
the Amalek who was father of the tribe. The Book of Genesis also
has another record: as early as before the destruction of Sodom the
Amalekites were at war with the kings of the Two-Stream Land, a
mighty coalition. The Amalekites who participated in these battles
in the days of Abraham could not have been descendants of
Amalek, descendant of Esau, himself a descendant of Abraham.
The Amalekites were thus of an older clan and no kinsmen of the
Twelve Tribes.



The Islamic historians consider Amalek as one of the most
ancient of the Arab tribes. Abulfeda, an Arab scholar of the
thirteenth century, wrote: "Shem [son of Noah] had several sons,
among them Laud, to whom were born Pharis, Djordjan, Tasm,
and Amalek,5 thus ascribing to these tribes a primeval existence.
But there are other Moslem historians who declare this Arabian
tribe to have been of Hamite stock, and give its ancestral line
correspondingly.6
The Amalekites ruled in Mecca and from their central position on
the great peninsula dominated other Arabian tribes. All parts of
Arabia Felix, Arabia Petraea, and Arabia Deserta alike were within
reach of their bows. And then came the upheaval.

The Upheaval in Arabia
There was a flood, an immense wave. People were swept away by
a blast. The earth quaked violently. The catastrophe was preceded
by plagues.
The tradition is thus handed down by Abu'l Faradj ( c.897-967)
in Kitab-Alaghaniy (Book of Songs):
The tradition reports that the Amalekites violated the privileges of the sacred territory
and that the Almighty God sent against them ants of the smallest variety which forced
them to desert Mecca.
Afterwards the Lord sent drought and famine and showed them the clouded1 sky at
the horizon. They marched without rest toward those clouds which they saw near



them, but were not able to reach them; they were pursued by the drought which was
always at their heels.
The Lord led them to their native land, where He sent against them "toufan" - a
deluge.2
Saba ( Sheba) in the south of Arabia, Mecca, and all the
thousand miles of the Tehama coast were shattered. All the tribes
on the peninsula suffered similar horrifying experiences.
Masudi3 ( d. about 956) also relates the tradition of this
catastrophe and tells of "swift clouds, ants, and other signs of the
Lord's rage," when many perished in Mecca. A turbulent torrent
overwhelmed the land of Djohainah, and the whole population
drowned in a single night.
"The scene of this catastrophe is known by the name of `Idam'
(Fury )."4 "Omeyah son of Abu-Salt of the tribe of Takif alluded to
this event in a verse worded thus: 'In days of yore, the Djorhomites
settled in Tehama, and a violent flood carried all of them away."
The Amalekites were put to flight by plagues that fell upon them
in Arabia, and in their escape they followed swift clouds.
Meanwhile Mecca was destroyed in a single night filled with a
terrible din. The land became a desert.
MASUDI: From el-Hadjoun up to Safa all became desert; in Mecca the nights are
silent, no voice of pleasant talk. We dwelt there, but in a most tumultuous night in the
most terrible of devastations we were destroyed.5
In tumult and disorder, fleeing the ominous signs and plagues
and driving their herds of animals infuriated by earthquakes and
evil portents, the fugitive bands of Amalekites reached the shores of
the Red Sea.
Plagues of insects, drought, earthquake in the night, "the most
terrible devastation," clouds sweeping the ground, a tidal flood
carrying away entire tribes - these disturbances and upheavals were
experienced in Arabia and Egypt alike.



This succession of phenomena helps us to recognize that they
occurred at the time of the Israelites' escape from Egypt, also
visited by plagues. They also witnessed the destructive flood at the
Sea of Passage, at Pi-ha-Khiroth, shortly before they met the
Amalekites. The Israelites met the Amalekites for the first time a few
days after they had crossed the sea.
Not only the Egyptians but also many Amalekites perished at the
sea. Other tribes, too - Djorhomites and Katan ( Yaktan ) - were
swept away by the flood and perished in great numbers.6 The thick
clouds covering the desert are repeatedly mentioned in the
Scriptures and in the Midrashim. The Midrashim narrate that the
Israelites encountered the Amalekites in a thick veil of clouds.
The Arab historians were not conscious of any link between their
story of the flood at the shores of the Red Sea and the events of the
Exodus, and did not connect them; if they had, they would have
been suspected of having handed down a passage of the Bible in
arbitrary form; but they were unaware of the significance of their
report.

mot ghayth, que fai rendu par celui de paturage, signifie aussi la pluie et le nuage qui
l'apporte."

The Arabian Traditions about the Amalekite Pharaohs
Many ancient Arab writers recorded the invasion of Egypt by the
Amalekites. There is a great deal of fancy in some of these stories.
In several instances they are spoiled by the clumsy attempts of
these authors to adapt their Arab traditions to the traditions of the



Hebrews, but not to the correct ones. So it happens that Joseph
was sold into Egypt when an Amalekite was the pharaoh, or that
Moses left Egypt when an Amalekite was the pharaoh. An Arab
author admitted that there was no concurrence as to the race of the
pharaoh who reigned at the time of Moses, whether he was a Copt,
a Syrian, or an Amalekite.1
We shall disregard these attempts of some Arabian authors to
insert stories culled from the biblical narrative into stories
indigenous to the Arabian peninsula, and we shall devote our
attention only to the narratives which did not have their source in
the Bible or the Haggada. They must have been autochthonous
and transmitted from generation to generation on the Arabian
peninsula.
There it was told that Syria and Egypt came simultaneously
under the domination of the Amalekites, who escaped from Arabia
when it was visited by plagues of insects, drought and famine, an
earthquake, and a flood at Safa and Tehama. An important
historical moment is revealed in the sequence: a natural
catastrophe composed of many significant phenomena was the
cause of a hurried migration of Amalekites toward Syria and Egypt.
The Arabian traditions that have survived to our time were
written down by authors of the ninth to the fourteenth centuries;
they refer to these ancient traditions and also to older authors,
sometimes naming them.
After the Amalekites invaded Syria and Egypt they established a
dynasty of their pharaohs. Al-Samhudi (844-911) wrote:
The Amalekites reached Syria and Egypt and took possession of these lands, and the
tyrants of Syria and the Pharaohs of Egypt were of their origin.2
Masudi, who wrote about the plagues that befell Arabia, and the
Bight of the Amalekites from Mecca, and the flood, recounted also
the conquest of Egypt by the Amalekites.
An Amalekite king, el-Welid, son of Douma, arrived from Syria, invaded Egypt,
conquered it, seized the throne and occupied it with-out opposition, his life long.2



We are reminded of the words of Manetho previously quoted: "A
people of ignoble origin from the east, whose coming was
unforeseen, had the audacity to invade the country, which they
mastered by main force without difficulty or even a battle."
In another work of his Masudi4 gives a more detailed account of
the conquest of el-Welid.
El-Weld, son of Douma, advanced at the head of a numerous army, with the intention
to overrun diverse countries and to overthrow their sovereigns.
The end of this passage recalls the sentence in the Haggada:
"Amalek . . . in his wantonness undertook to destroy the whole
world."5
Masudi continues:
When this conqueror came to Syria, he heard rumors about Egypt. He sent there one
of his servants named Ouna, with a great host of warriors. El-Welid oppressed the
inhabitants, seized their possessions and drew forth all the treasures he could find.
Masudi tells of strife among the Amalekites and of the invasion of
Egypt by a second wave of fhic people led by Alkan, surnamed
Abou-Kabous.
The Amalekites entered Egypt, destroyed many monuments and objects of art. . . .
The Amalekites invaded Egypt, the frontier of which they had already crossed, and
started to ravage the country . . . to smash the objects of art, to ruin the monuments.6
These words recall those of Manetho as cited by Josephus in
Against Apion and quoted above:
[The Hyksos] savagely burned the cities, razed the temples of the gods to the ground,
and treated the whole native population with the utmost cruelty.7
The words of Masudi accord with the mention of the destruction
of monuments in the inscription of Queen Hatshepsut, a ruler of
the Eighteenth Dynasty. In this inscription, referred to on a previous
page, it is said:
There had been Amu in the midst of the Delta and in Hauar [Auaris), and the foreign
hordes of their number had destroyed the ancient works; they reigned ignorant of the



god Ra.8
Tabari (838-923) related stories and legends of Amalekite
pharaohs and gave their genealogies. The following sentence is
characteristic:
Then the king of Egypt died and another king, his relative, ascended the throne. He
was also of Amalekite race and was named Kabous, son of Mosab, son of Maouya,
son of Nemir, son of Salwas, son of Amrou, son of Amalek.9
Abulfeda (1273-1331), in his history of pre-Islamic Arabia,
wrote:
There were Egyptian Pharaohs of Amalekite descent.10
He also mentioned a most violent tempest that had swept Egypt
in remote days.1 He gave the names of a succession of Amalekite
pharaohs and told of the domination of Syria by the Amalekites.12
Ibn Abd-Alhakam,13 cited by Yaqut (1179-1229), and other
names could be added to the authors quoted here, but those given
suffice to demonstrate that the tradition of Amalekite dynasties of
pharaohs was spread among the Arabian scholars.
The historical background of their stories about Amalekite
pharaohs in Egypt was regarded with distrust.14 There were
scholars who took an even more radical viewpoint and asserted
that the Amalekites had never existed.15 They based their
conclusion on the assumption that the name of the Amalek tribe
was never mentioned in Egyptian inscriptions.
On the other hand, an equally extreme viewpoint doubted the
very fact of the invasion of Egypt by the Hyksos and interpreted it
as a story of legendary origin; the Hyksos were supposed to be just
another dynasty of native rulers.16
The Amalekites were, presumably, not known to the Egyptian
people. The Hyksos (Amu) were equally unknown to other
peoples. Therefore the historical existence of the one or the other
was sometimes doubted.

Hyksos in Egypt
The Hyksos rule in Egypt endured through all the time that elapsed
between the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. The text of
the Papyrus Ipuwer was composed at the time of the invasion of
the Hyksos and it refers to this invasion. The expulsion of the
Hyksos and the period immediately preceding it are also described
in some contemporaneous documents. But the period between the



invasion and the expulsion is very poor in records; it is a dark age
in two senses.
Manetho is a late source on the dominance and expulsion of the
Hyksos; about one thousand years separated the historian from his
subject. He provides the information that after the Hyksos invaded
the country, destroying, burning, raping, and ravaging, they
established a dynasty of Hyksos pharaohs; that the first of these
kings, named Salitis or Salatis, resided in Memphis and "exacted
tribute from Upper and Lower Egypt, and left garrisons in the
places most suited for defence. In particular he secured his
eastern flank" to protect the realm from the north, as "he foresaw
that the Assyrians, as their power increased in the future, would
covet and attack his realm."1
There, to the east of the Delta, King Salitis discovered a
favorably situated place called Auaris, a strategic point from which
to control both Egypt and Syria.
He rebuilt and strongly fortified it with walls, and established a garrison there
numbering as many as two hundred and forty thousand armed men to protect his
frontier. This place he used to visit every summer, partly to serve out rations and pay
to his troops, partly to give them a careful training in manoeuvres, in order to
intimidate foreigners.2
The fourth king is called Apophis by Manetho, and he is said to
have ruled for sixty-one years. The first six king-shepherds are
considered the first Hyksos Dynasty of pharaohs. In Manetho
Josephus it is said of them:
The continually growing ambition of these six, their first rulers, was to extirpate the
Egyptian people.3
The rule of the Hyksos was cruel. They knew no mercy.
Substantiation of this may be found even in graves. The excavator
of one of the smaller garrison-fortresses of the Hyksos thus
described the contents of a grave: "A heap of bones stacked closely
together, most of them were of animals, but among them I found a



piece of human jaw and patella."4 In another grave he found an
"apparently separated arm, superfluous loose hand."
When we remember what Manetho said about the extreme
cruelty of the invaders, and compare it with the Hebrew narratives
about Amalekites mutilating their prisoners by cutting off members
of the body,5 the finding of an odd hand or jaw does not seem an
accidental occurrence. The garrison-fortresses were places of
torture.
The dominion of the Amu-Hyksos was not confined to Egypt.
Scarabs, or official seals, have been found in various countries,
with the names of King Apop and King Khian. The name of Khian
is engraved on a sphinx discovered in Baghdad and on a jar lid
found at Knossos in Crete. An inscription of Apop says that "his
father Seth, lord of Auaris, had set all foreign countries under his
feet." In Auaris was the sacrarium of Seth, whom the Hyksos
worshiped, and who, until the time of the Ramessides, was
regarded by the Egyptians as the personification of the dark power
(the contestor of Isis and Horus, or equivalent of the Greek
Typhon). The finding in distant countries of objects bearing the
names of Apop and Khian seems to prove that Apop's words were
no vain boast. Some historians have found themselves compelled
to believe that the Hyksos, if only for a transient period,
commanded a very great empire,6 and that at least the area of
political influence of the Amu-Hyksos was very extensive.
The last Hyksos Dynasty, the Seventeenth Egyptian Dynasty,
according to Manetho, was a dynasty of "shepherds and Theban
kings," meaning that in Thebes there were princes of Egyptian
nationality subordinate to the Hyksos pharaohs. The last of these
Hyksos pharaohs was Apop II, also a prominent king.

(Palestinians) by writers in Greek, see Herodotus ( trans. A. D. Godley; 1921-24), VII, 63.

Cutting a the hands of the fallen or captured enemy soldiers became a practice in a later
period of Egyptian history and Assyrian as well. This practice probably goes back to the
time of the Hyksos.

Malakhei-Roim - King-Shepherds
The Israelites left Egypt a few weeks, or perhaps only days, before
the invasion of the Hyksos; they could not avoid meeting these
Hyksos coming from Asia, and actually did meet them before they
reached Mount Sinai.
Did the Israelites know that Egypt had undergone an "eleventh"
and very severe plague - one which endured for centuries - the
invasion of the king-shepherds? When they sighted the Amalekites
in the whirling and trembling desert they might have been unaware
of the new ordeal that these despoilers would bring to Egypt.
But while in Canaan, during the whole time of the Judges, the
Israelites, who suffered from the onslaughts of the Amalekites, must
have known that Egypt, too, was afflicted with the same plague
and to an even greater degree. Is there any reference preserved in
the old Jewish sources that would hint at the Hyksos invasion of
Egypt immediately after the departure of the Israelites?
It is said in the enumeration of the plagues in Egypt:
PSALMS 78:49 He [the Lord] cast [sent forth] upon them fierceness of his anger,
wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
What may that mean, evil or bad angels? There is no plague
known as the "visit of evil angels." There is no expression like "evil
angels" to be found elsewhere in the Scriptures. There is an "angel
of death" or "Satan," but no "evil angels." It would appear that the
text is corrupted.
"Sending of evil angels" is (presumably) mishlakhat
malakheiroim.



"Invasion of king-shepherds" is mishlakhat malkhei-roim.
The only difference in spelling is one silent letter, aleph, in the
first case. It would thus seem that the second reading is the original.
The first reading is not only unusual Hebrew, but it is also contrary
to the grammatical structure of the language. If roim ("evil," plural)
were used as an adjective here, the preceding word could not take
a shortened form; roim must therefore be a noun. But if roim were
a noun, it would be in the singular and not in the plural; and
finally, the correct plural of "evil" is not roim but raoth. "Evil angels"
in correct Hebrew would be malakhim roim; "angels of evils"
malakhei raoth. Not only the sense but the grammatical form as
well speaks for the reading, "invasion of king-shepherds."
When the editor or copyist of the sentence could not find sense
in "king-shepherds," he changed the words to "evil angels" without
sufficient grammatical change.
Verse 49 of Psalm 78 must therefore be read:
He [the Lord] cast [sent forth] upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
indignation, and trouble, invasion of king-shepherds.
An old Hebrew legend throws a side light on the same problem:
Amalek fetched from Egypt the table of descent of the Jews [Israelites] . . . these lists
lay in the Egyptian archives. Amalek appeared before the Jewish [Israelite] camp, and
calling the people by name, he invited them to leave the camp and come out to him.1
This legend implies knowledge on the part of the Israelites of the
fact that the Amalekites came to Egypt and became the rulers of
the land. In what other way could they have come into possession
of the census lists in the Egyptian archives?
In Papyrus Ipuwer it is said:
PAPYRUS 6:7 Forsooth, public offices are opened and the census-lists are taken
away. Serfs become lords of serfs(?).
When the Amalekites vanquished Egypt, they may have looked
on themselves as the legatees of the former Egyptian Empire with
its colonies; in their wars with the Israelites in succeeding centuries



they might have argued that the Israelites had deserted their
bondage in Egypt.
1 Ginzberg, Legends, III, 56.
Palestine at the Time of the Hyksos Domination
The problem of why, in the Books of Joshua and Judges, which
cover more than four hundred years, there is no mention of
Egyptian domination over Canaan or any allusion to military
expeditions headed by pharaohs has remained unsolved. Yet
during this long period of time, according to the conventional
chronology, Palestine was dominated by Egypt.- -. ..
The revision presented here places the time of wandering, of
Joshua, and of Judges in the period of the Hyksos-Amalekite rule
over Egypt. In harmony with this revised scheme the Amalekites
must have been regarded at that time as the mightiest among the
nations.
Balaam, the sorcerer, was called upon to curse the Israelites
approaching Moab on their way from the desert. He set his face
toward the wilderness, but instead of cursing, he blessed Israel with
these words:
NUMBERS 24:7 . . . his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher
than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
Agag [Agog]1 was the name of the Amalekite king.
Standing on the edge of the mountain, Balaam turned his face in
another direction:
NUMBERS 24:20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
Amalek [is] the first of [among] the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for
ever.
These verses did not seem clear. The Amalekites are supposed to
have been an unimportant band of robbers; why were they called



"the first among the nations" and what could the blessing "higher
than Agag" mean? No satisfactory explanation was presented.
The Amalekites were at that time the first among the nations.
The highest degree of power was expressed by comparison with
the power of the Amalekite king Agog. He was the ruler over
Arabia and Egypt.
The name of the king Agog is the only Amalekite name that the
Scriptures have preserved.2 Besides the king Agog mentioned in
the Book of Numbers, there was another Amalekite king Agog,
their last king, who reigned some four hundred years later and was
a contemporary of Sau1.3
In the history of Egypt the most frequently mentioned name of
the Hyksos kings is Apop. One of the first and most prominent of
the Hyksos rulers was Apop; the last king of the Hyksos was also
Apop.
The early Hebrew written signs as they are preserved on the stele
of Mesha show a striking resemblance between the letters g (gimel)
and p (pei). No other two letters are so much alike in shape as
these: each is an oblique line connected to a shorter, more oblique
line, and is similar to the written number 7; the size of the angle
between the two oblique lines constitutes the only difference.
Nevertheless, it seems that not the Hebrew reading but rather the
Egyptian must be corrected; I have set forth some reasons in
another place.4 Almost every hieroglyphic consonant stands for
more than one sound, and only empirically are all the sounds
symbolized by a consonant found.
Agog I appears to be Apop I, and Agog II, Apop II. King Agog
reigned at the beginning of the period; according to Manetho,
Apop was the fourth king of the Hyksos Dynasty and ruled for
sixty-one years. Agog II reigned at the very end of the period, some
four hundred years later.
The Amu-Hyksos held Egypt in submission from their fortress
Auaris, which they built near the border of the country. Throughout



the land they maintained garrisons (Manetho).
In Palestine there was likewise a fort which the Amalekites built
for a garrison; it was strategically situated in the heart of the
country, in the land of Ephraim.
The Song of Deborah, like the blessing of Balaam, is an old
fragment. An obscure verse reads: "Out of Ephraim their root is in
Amalek" ( Judges 5:14).5
"Their" obviously refers to the Canaanites, and to Jabin, king of
Canaan, who reigned in Hazor, and to his captain Sisera, who
commanded nine hundred chariots of iron. They oppressed Israel.
The Israelites under the guidance of Deborah and Barak succeeded
temporarily in breaking the yoke. The verse cited seems to mean
that the strength of the Canaanites was based upon the support
they received from the Amalekite citadel in the land of Ephraim.
This citadel is also mentioned in another verse of the Book of
Judges: "Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the
Amalekites" (Judges 12:15 ).
The Amalekites supported the Canaanites; this explains the
reversal in the progress of the Israelite penetration into Canaan and
their occasional status as vassals. The Amalekites ruled over vast
territories and in their colonial politics allied themselves with
kindred nations. This is the ground for the Hebrew tradition that
the Amalekites posed as Moabites, Canaanites, and other peoples,
and in these disguises carried on war against Israel, or that they
supported the Canaanites in their war against the Israelites.6 The
Midianites were close kin of the Amalekites, related since the days
when the one people occupied Mecca and the other lived in
Medina;7 together they often invaded the land of Israel just before
the harvest.
JUDGES 6:3-6 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,
and the Amalekites, and the children of the east. . . . And they encamped against
them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no
sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.



For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for
multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into
the land to destroy it.
And Israel was greatly impoverished. . . .
Their cattle and their camels without number are responsible for
their Egyptian name of king-shepherds. Marching to devastate a
country, they drove their cattle before them. Also in the next
chapter of the Book of Judges (7:12) they and their cattle are
compared to "grasshoppers" and to the "sand by the sea side."
They employed the same system of exploitation and plunder as
in Egypt. They waited until the people of the land had sown; then,
shortly before the time of gathering, they appeared in a multitude
with their herds to devour the harvest and to take away the oxen
used for plowing and every other animal of the household.
PAPYRUS ERMITAGE 1116b, recto: The Amu approach in their might and their
hearts rage against those who are gathering in the harvest, and they take away [their]
line from the ploughing. . . . The land is utterly perished, and naught remains.8
The time of wandering in the desert is reckoned as forty years;
the time of Judges is estimated variously, generally as four hundred
years. The dark age in the Near East continued as long as the
supremacy of the Amalekites endured. The Israelites seem to have
been the only people who incessantly struggled for their
independence against the Amalekite and allied tribes, and by their
resistance they also safeguarded the maritime cities of Tyre and
Sidon.
When under valiant leadership, the Israelites dared to take the
offensive. Under Gideon they reached even the cities of Midian. It
was a heroic time. Nothing is known of uprisings in Egypt or in
other places of the Amalekite Empire during these centuries. But
every effort on the part of the Israelites to achieve and retain real
independence was doomed to failure as long as the Amalekites
ruled northern Africa and Arabia up to the land of the Euphrates,
as long as garrisons were stationed at fortified points scattered
throughout many countries, and the military wedge they drove



toward the coast, between the lands of Africa and Asia, remained
unbroken.
It was during this time that the saying was coined (Exodus
17:16) : ". . . the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation
to generation."
1 Cf. the vowels in the Massorete Bible, Numbers 24:7, and I Samuel 15, and Esther 3.
2 Numbers 24:7. The name of the Hyksos king, Khian, was like that of a planet: "Khiun . .
star of your god" (Amos 5:26). However, the spelling of the king's name has the sound
expressed by the letter khet and the name of the star has khaf.

7 The region of the Midianites is incorrectly located on the desert strips on both sides of the
Aqaba Gulf. The traditions of the Arabs connecting the Amalekites with Mecca relate the
Midianites to the region of Medina. Compare also the name of the high priest of the
Midianites in the days of Moses - Jethro, called also Reuel, Raguel, and Hobab - with
Jathrib, another ancient Arab name for Medina.

The Length of the Hyksos Period
According to Manetho as cited by Josephus (Against Apion, I, 84),
the Hyksos period lasted five hundred and eleven years. But in
modern books on Egyptian history this period is drastically
reduced. The reduction was not based on any consideration of
cultural changes or archaeological finds, ancient charts or dates,
but mainly on the fact that the end of the Twelfth Dynasty of the
Middle Kingdom is ascribed, on the ground of the astronomical
computations of the Sothis period, to - 1780. It was followed by the
Thirteenth Dynasty (the last of the Middle Kingdom) and by the
Hyksos period ere the New Kingdom was inaugurated with the
advent of the Eighteenth Dynasty in - 1580, again according to the



calculations based by modern scholars on the Sothis period
calendar. If the dates are right, about two hundred years are left for
the Thirteenth Dy-nasty and the Hyksos period, and since some of
the kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty had long reigns, the most that
can be left for the Hyksos domination in Egypt is one hundred
years. This view was offered and defended by Eduard Meyer.
In the view of Flinders Petrie and a few of his followers, this span
of time is entirely insufficient for the interval between the Middle
and the New Kingdoms. The cultural changes were enormous: as if
a curtain fell at the end of the Middle Kingdom and was raised
again over the entirely different scene of the New Kingdom.
Because of the immense changes, Petrie advanced the idea that
between the end of the Twelfth Dynasty and the beginning of the
Eighteenth were not 200 years but 1660: in other words, an
additional Sothis period of 1460 years was interposed by Petrie;
the time of the Hyksos domination, instead of being reduced from
Josephus' figure, was lengthened.
These two schemes are called the "long" and the "short
chronology." They have in common the date - 1580 for the
beginning of the New Kingdom. Neither the "long chronology" nor
the "short chronology" proposed to reduce this date. Both are built
on the Sothis period for the computation of Egyptian chronology.
At the end of this work we shall examine the validity of this notion
that references to the star Sothis or Sirius may provide a basis for a
chronological scheme. The great divergence between the schools of
historians, as much as 200 or 1660 years for the same period,
immediately preceding the New Kingdom, is amazing, especially if
we keep in mind that Egyptian chronology served as a basis for the
chronology of the entire complex called the ancient East.
Some scholars tried to take the middle road, and, disregarding
the involved computations on which the Sothis reckoning is made,
suggested a period of four or five hundred years for the Hyksos
period. "Were the Sothic date unknown, our evidence would not
require more than 400 or at most 500 years between the two - the
twelfth and the eighteenth - dynasties."1



The conciliatory view did not take root among the scholars; the
long chronology after the death of Petrie had very few supporters;
and the short chronology, also called the chronology of the "Berlin
School," became supreme.
In this book we occupy ourselves with Egyptian history from the
moment when the Middle Kingdom came to its end with the
Hyksos conquest of Egypt. If the Hyksos period is measured by the
time the Amalekites dominated the Near East, or by the sum of
years allotted by the Scriptures to the wandering in the desert and
to the leadership of the Judges, a time span of over four hundred
and forty years should be assigned to the period in question.

The Expulsion of the Hyksos in the Egyptian
and Hebrew Records
All the time of subjugation to the Hyksos, Egypt was ruled from
Auaris, where a strong garrison was kept by the king-shepherds.
Here these kings received tribute from Egypt and gave
instructions to their regional governors. The princes of the nomes
were dependent vassals and were treated in a disdainful manner,
described in the Sallier Papyrus I.1
King Apop II (Agog II) sent a messenger from Auaris with a
humiliating demand to the Egyptian prince Seknenre.
SALLIER PAPYRUS I The prince of the southern city [Thebes] remained silent and
wept a long time, and he did not know how to return answer to the messenger of king
Apophis [Apop].
The Egyptian prince was arrested by the messenger of King
Apop H and brought to Auaris. The end of the papyrus is missing.
This roll of papyrus tells the story of the abuse and derision to
which the dependent princes of the nomes were subjected.
But it was the darkness before dawn. The last plague, the
domination of the shepherds, which had endured since the



Exodus, was approaching its end.
The Carnarvon tablet records the participation of the vassal
pharaoh Kamose, son of Seknenre, in action against the Hyksos.2
He was assisted by some foreign troops. An Egyptian monument
has also preserved a description of the final act: the story of the
expulsion of the Hyksos is engraved on the wall of the tomb of an
officer of Ahmose, a vassal pharaoh of one of the nomes and
probably a brother of Kamose; the name of the officer was also
Ahmose. The story is in the form of a narrative about the sieges
and battles in which the officer took part.
In the Ahmose inscription, which is the best available Egyptian
source on the war of deliverance, an enigma is inserted concerning
the most important circumstance. Obviously, not rebellious
Egyptian princes but some warriors coming from abroad were the
real deliverers of Egypt. The inscription reads:
I followed the king on foot when he rode abroad in his chariot.
One besieged the city of Avaris. I showed valor on foot before his majesty. . . . One
fought on the water in the canal [riverbed] of Avaris. . . . Then there was again fighting
in this place; I again fought. . . . One fought in this Egypt, south of this city; then I
brought away a living captive. . . . One captured Avaris. . . . One besieged Sharuhen
[s'-e-h'-n] for six years [3 ] [and] his majesty took it. . . .4
The indefinite pronoun would not have been used if the
Egyptian king had been at the head of the besieging army. Had the
Egyptian prince been the main figure in this war for freedom his
triumph would not have been attributed to the indefinite "one."
The writer would have said: "His Majesty besieged . . ." or "Our
troops fought . . ." The Egyptian document says in fact that in the
war against the Hyksos a foreign army was active.5 However,
Egyptian inscriptions did not memorialize the deeds of foreign
kings, and hence the name of the king who destroyed the Hyksos is
missing. The war was fought by a foreign "one," and the history
written on that tomb did not ascribe the sieges and the expulsion of
the Hyksos to the dead man's own chief, who only aided the
foreign liberator.



Samuel, the priest and prophet, said to Saul, whom he had
anointed to be king over Israel:
SAMUEL 15:2-3 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to
Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. Now go and
smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have.
Saul gathered "two hundred thousand footmen, and ten
thousand men of Judah."
I SAMUEL 15:5 And Saul came to [the] city of Amalek, and laid wait in [the bed of]
the stream [nakhal].6
These words, "city of Amalek," have always been a stumbling
block for commentators and Bible students. The Amalekites are
supposed to have been a small tribe of unsettled Bedouins;
therefore, what does the "city of Amalek" mean?"7
It is said that since days of old the Amalekites dwelt in the south.
One indication as to the location of the place is its topography: the
city was besieged from the bed of a stream (nakhal). The city must
have been situated near a river. In southern Palestine, the Sinai
desert, northern Arabia, and up to the boundaries of Egypt there
are no rivers save the "river of Egypt" - the wadi of el-Arish, the
only river to which the Scriptures persistently apply the name
nakhal. In winter it is torrential, in summer its bed is dry.
A geographical indication may also be tentatively drawn from
the reference in the verse that follows: ". . . until thou comest to
Shur, that is over against Egypt." This was the southernmost point
of the victorious campaign of Saul, as a result of the capture of the
city of the Amalekites.
I SAMUEL 15:7-8 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to
Shur, that is over against Egypt. And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive. . .
.
The identity of the foreign liberator of Egypt is thus revealed by
the Scriptures. The "one" was King Saul. Apop II was Agog II. The
Amalekite city was Auaris. In Egyptian and Hebrew sources alike



the strategic use of the bed of the stream in the siege of this city is
stressed. Rich spoils of the shepherds' city are mentioned in both
sources; it consisted of oxen, sheep, and lambs (I Samuel 15:9). In
both sources it is said that during this campaign the "one" (in the
inscription of the officer Ahrnose) or Saul (in the Book of Samuel)
fought the Amu-Amalekites and destroyed them "to the south of
Auaris" or "until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt."
Contraposing the Hebrew and Egyptian sources will help to
identify the location of Auaris. The material for exact identification
is brought together later in this book.
The reference "from Havilah" was also a difficult problem for
exegesis.8 How could a skirmish with insignificant Amalekites or
the siege of some settlement of nomads result in a victory sweeping
across Havila in the land of the Euphrates and up to the border of
Egypt? It has been supposed that the text is corrupt and that
instead of Havila another name must be read,9 or that another
Havila besides the one in the land of the Euphrates was
somewhere near Egypt.10
If the true role of the Amalekites during the long period of
Judges is recognized, no difficulty will be encountered in accepting
the text as correct. The capture of the Amalekite stronghold with its
king was the signal for the collapse of the Amu-Amalekite Empire,
with the immediate result that all of Syria to the land of the
Euphrates - and Egypt, too - regained liberty.

as "Flues, Bach, Fluesbett."

of all the suggested possibilities . . . has in every case yielded unsatisfactory results."
The Hyksos Retreat to Idumaea
A detail of the siege of Auaris is preserved in another document
written at a much later date. Manetho narrates in his history of
Egypt, as quoted by Josephus, that the Hyksos, after having been
beleaguered for a long time in Auaris, were allowed under an
agreement to leave the place.
They [the besieged in Auaris] were all to evacuate Egypt and go whither they would
unmolested. Upon these terms no fewer than 240,000, entire households with their
possessions, left Egypt and traversed the desert to Syria.
Then, terrified by the might of the Assyrians, who at that time were masters of Asia,
they built a city in the country now called Judaea, capable of accommodating their
vast company, and gave it the name of Jerusalem.1
This confused statement of Manetho is in obvious conflict with
the inscription of the officer Ahmose, who recorded the capture of
the city Auaris by siege, but did not mention any agreement with its
defenders.
The biblical record may reconcile the conflicting statements of
the contemporary warrior and of the later historian as far as they
concern the immediate fate of the besieged people.



Before storming the Amalekite city Saul made an agreement with
the tribe of the Kenites, affliated with the Amalekites, regarding
their departure from the city under siege.
I SAMUEL 15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them . . . So the Kenites departed from
among the Amalekites.
According to Ahmose, after the capture of Auaris the Hyksos
Amu who saved themselves from death escaped to Sharuhen in
southern Palestine. In Manetho's story it is stated that the Hyksos,
retreating from Auaris, escaped into Judea to a place which they
built and named Jerusalem. There is not the shadow of a doubt
that the contemporaneous inscription on the grave of Ahmose
contains the correct rendition of the name of the place to which the
Hyksos retired, and that the later rendering of Manetho is wrong.
Either Manetho's source or his text was corrupted, and the lesser
known Sharuhen was replaced by the better known Jerusalem (
Jerushalaim).
This mistake, accidental or deliberate, has played a harsh role in
the fate of the Jewish people beginning with the Ptolemaic age; it
has left deep marks on the behavior and spiritual evolution of other
peoples; only seldom has a mistake of a writing hand had so many
tragic consequences as this corrupt text, which is exposed here by
comparing the two Egyptian sources on the escape of the Hyksos
Sharuhen in one source, to Jerusalem in the other. I shall add a
few more words on this subject at the end of this chapter.
The defeat of the Hyksos-Amu was brought about in two
successive sieges. After the capture of Auaris, the stronghold and
residence of Apop, the Hyksos-Amu retreated to Sharuhen2 in
southern Palestine, and here the last siege took place. Ahmose's
version of the retreat of the Amu into southern Palestine
corresponds with the scriptural narrative. After the capture of the
Amalekite city and Saul's overwhelming victory, the Amalekites
were not wholly destroyed. Those who escaped with their lives fell
back to the hill country of southern Palestine.



From there they undertook a raid on the neighboring cities. This
was still during the reign of Saul, and David was one of his officers.
I SAMUEL 80:1-3 . . . the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten
Zildag, and burned it with fire; . . . and went on their way.
So David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burned with fire; and their
wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
The practice of burning the cities, carrying off the women and
children, and withdrawing was the same as the Hyksos had em
ployed in Egypt when they invaded it, four or five hundred years
before: "They savagely burned the cities . . . carrying off the wives
and children into slavery" ( Manetho, quoted by Josephus3 ). David
with four hundred men pursued the Amalekite band that had
carried off his wives. In the desert they found an unconscious man
who "had eaten no bread nor drank any water three days and three
nights."
I SAMUEL, 30:11-18 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
David . . . and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him. . . .
And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? . . . And he said, I am a young
man of Egypt, servant to an Arnalckitc; and ray master left me, because three days
agone I fell sick.
David followed the Egyptian slave and found the Amalekite
band and rescued the captive women and children.
This episode is most instructive. It shows that the Amalekites
invaded the south of Palestine after they had lost their stronghold
on the border of Egypt. It reveals also a very striking detail: the
Egyptian young man said that he was a slave to an Amalekite
master.
Let us return the two histories - that of the Hebrews and that of
the Egyptians - to their conventional places in chronology. What
does it mean that an Egyptian, a son of the ruling and proud
nation, is a servant of an Amalekite, a poor nomad? This man, in
identifying himself, spoke of his being a "servant" and the



Amalekite being the "master" as of something that was the order of
the day.
But they were already the last in their respective roles, the
Egyptian slave and his Amalekite master. The Amalekites were in
retreat and flight; the few raids, such as that from Sharuhen to
Ziklag, both towns in southern Palestine, were the last offensives.
Their warriors were dispersed; some of them came into the
Philistine region on the coast. Zildag was on the outskirts of the
land of the Philistines, and Sharuhen was a point between Philistia
and Seir, the Amalekites' old homeland.
Shortly after the great natural catastrophe the Philistines arrived
from the island of Caphtor and occupied the coast of Canaan4
They intermarried with the Amalekites, sought their favor, accepted
their political leadership, provided them with metalwork and
pottery, and, during the centuries that followed, lost more and
more of their own spiritual heritage and became a hybrid nation.
This merging of the Philistines and the Amalekites provided, I
think, the basis for the Egyptian tradition (Manetho) that the
Hyksos Dynasties in the later period of their rule in Egypt were of
"Phoenician origin,"5 and also for the assertion that the Philistines
were of Amalekite blood.6
Saul, after his great victory over the Amalekites, engaged himself
in a war with the Philistines. He went into this war with a heavy
heart. Samuel, the prophet, had spoken stern words to him his
kingdom would be taken from him for the kindness he had shown
by sparing the life of Agog, king of the Amalekites, the eternal
enemies of the Jewish people. Samuel killed Agog, never met Saul
again, and died. Saul, with the help of necromancy, tried to get in
touch with the deceased Samuel. The day after his visit to the witch
at Endor, Philistine archers struck him down in the middle of the
battle. He and his three sons fell on the field. It was an Amalekite,
out of the host of the Philistines, who, according to one scriptural
version, killed the wounded Saul at his request and brought the evil
tidings to David (II Samuel 1:8).



Historical credit for freeing the Near East from the yoke of the
Hyksos belongs to Saul, but his great deed was not esteemed, not
even recognized. The capture of Auaris and the destruction of the
Amalekite host changed the course of history. Once more Egypt
rose to power and splendor after being freed from hundreds of
years of abject slavery by a descendant of the Hebrews who had
been slaves there.
Posterity did not learn of the deeds of Saul; even his
contemporaries did not reward him with gratitude. Cursed by
Samuel for his soft heart when he spared the life of Agog, driven to
depression, and having a premonition of his fate, he went to his
last battle. His head and the head of his son Jonathan were cut off
by the Philistines and carried through the villages; the headless
bodies were hung on the walls of Beth-Shan, in the valley of the
Jordan.
This was the sad end of the man anointed to be the first king of
Judah and Israel. In a little-known page of some Haggada he is
said to have been more pious than David, gentle and generous, the
real "elect of God."
Only after overpowering the Philistines could the Israelites
consider themselves a free people. The double task fell to David: to
destroy the Amalekites in their last strongholds in southern
Palestine, and to drive the Philistines from the hilly land.
The officer Ahmose, after the fall of Auaris, followed his prince to
Sharuhen in southern Palestine to participate in the siege of this
stronghold. The Amu-Hyksos defended it for three long years. This
last stronghold of the Amu had to be taken by storm.
The Scriptures have preserved the story of the Amalekites
"invading the south" after their disaster on the border of Egypt.
Other Hebrew sources have retained the story of the siege of the
"Amalekite capital" in the south of Palestine.7
"Among all the heroic achievements of Joab, the most
remarkable is the taking of the Amalekite capital."8 For a long time



the chosen troops, twelve thousand strong, besieged the stronghold
without result. A legend about the adventures of Joab, a captain of
David, who penetrated alone into this "very large" city, became a
favorite motif for storytellers.
The Israelites stormed the Amalekite city, destroyed the heathen
temples, and killed the inhabitants. King David was not present at
this prolonged siege; King Ahmose was probably with Joab's army
as an ally. The officer Ahmose wrote: "One besieged Sharuhen for
three years and his majesty took it." The Egyptian king got his
portion of the spoils and the officer Ahmose his share, and he
described it.
The Egyptian king returned to Egypt and undertook a campaign
against Ethiopia; Joab turned his army to the east and after a time
was able to put the crown of the Ammonite king at the feet of
David.9

7 The natural retreat for an army pressed at once from Egypt and from the shore of
Palestine would be in the direction of Edom, more particularly toward Petra. In the days of
Strabo, trade caravans coming from Arabia "come to Petra, and then to Rhinocolura [el
Arish], which is in Phoenicia near Egypt, and thence to the other peoples," and according
to this author, this route was pre-ferred in earlier times (Strabo, The Geography, 16, 4, 24).
Sharuhen was probably situated close to Petra. Petra is "fortified all round by a rock" (Ibid.,
16, 4, 21). The early .builders of Petra are not known. See Sir H. B. W. Kennedy, Petra, Its
History and Monuments (London, 1925), p. 81, and G. Delman, Petra and seine

The Queen Tahpenes
On the ruins of the great Amalekite Empire two kingdoms rose
simultaneously to freedom and power: Judah and Egypt. The
inheritance was divided between them.
Judah absorbed the Asiatic provinces of the Amalekites from the
Euphrates in the north to the border of Egypt in the south.
Expansion was also eastward - David and Joab led the army
against Moab, Amon, Edom, and Aram. Aram meant Syria, and
the area stretching toward Mesopotamia; Edom's land was along
the entire shore of the Red Sea, the greater part of Arabia.1
II SAMUEL 8:14 And he [David] put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
garrisons. . . .
Joab remained six months in Edom (I Kings 11:16) and smote
"every male in Edom." Hadad, a child of royal blood, was among
those who escaped from Midian and came to Paran; and "out of
Paran they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt."
I KINGS 11:19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tah-pe-nes the queen.
This was in the days of David. The pharaoh must have been
Ahmose.2 Among his queens must have been one by the name of
Tahpenes. We open the register of the Egyptian queens to see
whether Pharaoh Atunose had a queen by this name. Her name is
actually preserved and read Tanethap, Tenthape, or, possibly,
Tahpenes3
1 According to the Arabian tradition, Medina was conquered by David; see al-Samhudi
Geschichte der Stadt Medina, ed. Wiistenfeld, pp. 26ff.
2 Hadad left Egypt after the death of David (1 Kings 11:21). Ahmose reigned more than
twenty years, according to Maned* twenty-five years.

The Location of Auaris



Where was Auaris, the stronghold of the Amu-Hyksos, the city
which served to keep Egypt in bondage? It was large enough to
contain within its walls tens and even hundreds of thousands of
warriors, besides the population of women and children and slaves,
and to provide for large herds and flocks.
The description Manetho gives in his history points to a site on
the eastern frontier of Egypt.
[Salitis, king of the Hyksos] left garrisons in the places most suited for defence. In
particular he secured his eastern flank, as he foresaw that the Assyrians, as their power
increased in future, would covet and attack his realm. Having discovered in the
Sethroite nome a city very favourably situated on the east of the Bubastis arm of the
river, called after some ancient theological tradition Auaris, he rebuilt and strongly
fortified it with walls, and established a garrison there numbering as many as two
hundred and forty thousand armed men to protect his frontier.1
According to Manetho, Auaris had a great stone wall "in order to
secure all their possession and spoil."
Several scholars have made various conjectures: it was located at
Pelusium, at Tanis, and at Tell-el-Yehudiyeh. In the last-named
place Hyksos tombs were unearthed,2 but archaeological study did
not confirm the opinion of the excavator that it was Auaris. It was a
small stronghold and not the huge fortress of the Hyksos rulers,
pharaohs from the Fourteenth up to the Seventeenth Dynasty.
Auaris is futilely sought on the eastern branch of the Delta.'
However, the precise translation of Manetho-Josephus is: "to the
east from the Bubastis arm of the river."3
Auaris can be located in the following way:
Saul conquered "the Amalekite city," the residence of the king
Agog (I Samuel 15). The capture of this city terminated the
domination of Amalekites over "the land from Havilah until thou
comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt."
By comparing the last sentence with one in I Samuel (27:8) - ". .
. and the Amalekites . . . of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou
goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt" - we find a clue to the



location of the Amalekite city on the border of Egypt, but not in
Egypt proper.
This also corresponds with the statement in the inscription of the
officer Ahmose: "I followed the king on foot when he rode abroad
in his chariot. One besieged the city of Auaris."
The meaning of the name "Auaris" is "the town of the desert
strip."4
Auaris on the northeastern frontier of Egypt was designed by its
builder, the Hyksos king Salitis, to secure the eastern flank against
any assault from the north.5 The fortress dominated Egypt and
Syria. It was situated on a river - this is told in the Egyptian record
of Ahmose and in the story of the siege by Saul. "One fought on
the water in the river" (Ahmose). "And Saul came to [the] city of
Amalek, and laid wait in the stream" (I Samuel 15:5).
The only river in the whole area is the seasonal stream of el
Arish. Because of the mention of the river battle in the inscription
of Ahmose, Auaris was sought on the eastern branch of the Nile,
though Manetho-Josephus wrote that it was to the east from the
eastern branch of the Delta.
Moreover, the name of the river "nakhal" on which the Amalekite
city was built is repeatedly applied in the Scriptures to the stream of
el-Arish, which is at the border of Egypt (Nakhal Mizraim).6
From the later history of Egypt we also may derive clues for the
location of Auaris.
Haremhab, the king who ruled before the Nineteenth Dynasty in
Egypt, used to cut off the noses of offenders against the law and
banish them to the region of Tharu. The station of Tharu was the
northeastern outpost of Egypt, as may be seen from the description
of various campaigns into Syria undertaken by kings of the
Nineteenth Dynasty. It must have been near Auaris, if it was not
another name for the same place.7
The noseless offenders were sent to a place for the "unclean";
one deprived of his nose was in appearance similar to a leper,



unclean for religious service, and kept apart from society. The
unclean were sent into exile to the remotest part of the country.
Manetho, writing of the rebellion of these unclean at a later date,
said:
The king . . . assigned them for habitation and protection the
abandoned city of the shepherds, called Auaris.8
The place where the noseless exiles lived was called by Greek
and Roman authors Rhinocolura (cut-off nose) or Rhinocorura.. It
was identified as el-Arish: Septuagint translated "Nakhal Mizraim"
(the stream of el-Arish) by this name, Rlainocorura.9 Hence Auaris
of the ancients is el-Arish of today.
When the archaeologists excavate on the banks of el-Arish they
will find the remnants of Auaris, one of the largest fortresses of
antiquity.10
As a supplementary bit of evidence I cite the following passage
from Masudi about a sovereign of the First Dynasty of Amalekite
pharaohs.
In the neighborhood of el-Arish he constructed a fortress.11

"Nakhal Mizraim" as "Wadi el-Arish," and similarly Abu-faid. See F. Hitzig, Urgeschichte and
Mythologie der Philisttier (Leipzig, 1845), pp. 112ff. Hitzig recognized that el-Arish must
have been an old city (Laris of the Crusaders ), but was unable to identify the ancient city
that had been situated on the site of el-Arish or Rhinocolura.

channels, are nevertheless noticeably similar.
Hyksos and Amalekite Parallels
Is the identity of the Amalekites and Hyksos established, or were
they perhaps two different peoples? The historical evidence of the
preceding pages will be juxtaposed.
A people called the Amu or Hyksos invaded Egypt after a great
natural catastrophe,1 when the river "turned into blood" and the
earth shook.2 They overran Egypt without encountering any
resistance.3
The invaders were utterly cruel; they mutilated the wounded and
cut off the limbs of their captives;4 they burned cities, savagely
destroyed monuments and objects of art, and razed the temples to
the ground5 they held the religious feelings of the Egyptians in
contempt.6
They enslaved the Egyptians and imposed tribute on them.7
These invaders came from Asia8 and were called Arabians,9 but
had some Hamitic features too.10 ° They were herdsmen,11 and
they were skilled with the bow:12 their kings ruled as pharaohs of
Egypt.13 They also ruled over Syria and Canaan, the islands of the
Mediterranean, and other countries, and had no peer for a long
period.14



The Amu built a great city fortress east from the Delta of the
Nile.15 They impoverished the native population of Egypt, usually
invading the fields with their cattle before harvest time.16
Among their kings were at least two rulers by the name (
tentatively read) of Apop; both were outstanding, one at the
beginning, the other at the very close, of the period.17
The domination of this people extended over many countries of
the Near and Middle East. Their dynasties ruled some five hundred
years," and their rule ended when their fortress-residence on the
river was put under siege by some foreign host." A part of the
beleaguered population of the fortress was allowed to depart;2 ° the
bed of the river was the main scene of the siege and of the final
storming of the fortress?"
With the crushing of the Amu Empire after this siege, Egypt
became free, and the expelled invaders moved to southern Canaan
to the stronghold of Sharuhen, where they maintained their hold a
few years longer.22 This fortress in the south of Canaan was
beleaguered. The siege was protracted. Finally the city was
stormed, its defenders killed, and the few survivors were dispersed
and lost their importance.23
They left a deep feeling of hatred in the people of Egypt.24
The other people were called Amalekites. They left Arabia after a
series of plagues25 and immediately after a violent earthquake.26
Many of them perished during the migration in a sudden flood that
swept the land of Arabia.27 They sighted the Israelites coming out
of Egypt, which was laid in ruins by a great catastrophe.28 In this
catastrophe the water in the river turned red as blood, the earth
shook, the sea rose in a sudden tidal wave.29
The invaders from Arabia occupied the south of Palestine and
simultaneously moved toward Egypt.30 They conquered Egypt
without meeting resistance.31



The Amalekite conquerors came from Arabia, but apparently
they had Hamitic blood in their veins." They were a nation of
herdsmen and roamed with their large herds from field to field.33
They mutilated the wounded and the prisoners, cut off limbs,
and were unspeakably cruel in many other ways.34 They stole
children and carried off women;35 they burned cities;36 they
destroyed monuments and objects of art that had survived the
catastrophe, and despoiled Egypt of her wealth.37 They were
contemptuous of the religious feelings of the Egyptians.38
The Amalekites built a city-fortress on the northeastern border of
Egypt.39 Their chieftains were pharaohs and ruled from their
fortress.40
They held sway over western Asia and northern Africa and had
no peer in their time.41 They kept the Egyptian population in
bondage, and their tribesmen used the Egyptians as slaves.42 They
also built smaller strongholds in Syria-Palestine,43 and by
periodically invading the country with their herds before harvest
time, the impoverished the people of Israel.44 Their domination
over many countries of the Near and Middle East endured,
according to various reckonings, for almost five hundred years.45
Among the kings of the Amalekites there were at least two by the
name of Agog, both of them outstanding: one a few decades after
the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the other at the very end of
the period of Amalekite domination.46
This people intermingled with the Philistines.47
Their supremacy came to an end when their fortress-residence
on the border of Egypt was besieged by Saul, king of Israel.48 The
bed of the river (nakhal) was the main scene of the siege.49 A large
part of the besieged garrison was allowed to depart.50 After this
siege and the fall of the fortress the Amalekite Empire from Havila
in the land of the Euphrates to "over against Egypt" collapsed.51
Their remnants moved into mountainous southern Palestine,52



where they gathered their strength in a stronghold-city. But that
stronghold, too, was surrounded and, after a protracted siege, was
captured by storm.53 After that they lost their significance.54
They left in the people of Israel an intense feeling of hatred.55
On the basis of the foregoing, the conclusion is inescapable that
the Amu of the Egyptian sources and the Amalekites of the Hebrew
and Arab sources were not two different peoples, but one and the
same nation. Even the name is the same: Amu, also Omaya, a
frequent name among the Amalekites, was a synonym for
Amalekite. Dshauhari (Djauhari), an Arabian lexicographer of the
tenth century of the present era, wrote: "It is handed down that this
name [Amu, or Omaya] was a designation for an Amalekite man.56
The Amu, or the Hyksos, were the Amalekites.
This identity, established on a large number of correlations and
parallels, is the answer to the two-thousand-two-hundred-year-old
riddle: Who were the Hyksos? As early as the days of Josephus
Flavius, in the first century, it was already a debated question of
long standing. The arguments of the present chapter for the identity
of the Amu-Hyksos and the Amalekites have been stated and
repeated here point by point because of the momentous
consequences this identification carries. The succeeding parts of
this book will show how important the consequences are.

The Confusion of Hyksos and Israelites and the Beginning of
Anti-Semitism



The Israelites could never forget the time of their suffering in
Egypt, but they did not bear any hatred against the Egyptians1 or
other peoples of antiquity; the Amalekites alone became the
symbol of evil and the object of their hate.
DEUTERONOMY 25:17-19 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way,
when ye were come forth out of Egypt;
How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were
feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.
Therefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given then rest from all thine
enemies round about . . . that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from
under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.
The utter wickedness of this people was iterated and reiterated
throughout the old literature:2 how they came to "suck the blood"
of the weary in the desert; how cowardly they acted in attacking
from ambush; how vile and ignoble and merciless they were.
They mutilated the wounded and blasphemed by throwing the
mutilated parts of the bodies toward the heavens and jeered at the
Lord3
A legend presents the feeling of the Israelite nation in these
symbolic words:
So long as the seed of Amalek exists, the face of God is, as it were, covered, and will
only then come to view when the seed of Amalek shall have been exterminated.4
There was also a tradition that "God bade Moses impress upon
the Jews to repulse no heathen should he desire conversion, but
never accept an Amalekite as a proselyte." For his sins Amalek shall
"the first descend to hell." "God Himself took up the war against
Amalek."
The Hyksos engendered the same hatred in the Egyptians; their
extreme cruelty and their wantonness were cut deep into the
memory of the people. They befouled and burned rolls of papyri
and objects of art; in their camps they tortured their captives.
Heads were cracked open, teeth smashed, eyes gouged out, and
limbs hacked off. They professed faith only in their superior



strength and employed it in their camps on their defenseless
victims.
Even the Arabian authors exposed the evil and the recklessness
of the Amalekites in dealing with the holy and the profane in
Mecca and in Egypt. They, too, proclaimed that the Lord had sent
them away from Mecca for their iniquity.
It was the lot of Saul to carry on the war of liberation of Israel
and Egypt. That the Israelites were not remembered with praise for
what they had done for Egypt and were referred to as "one" and
"they" in Egyptian history was the least of the injustices; their real
reward at the hands of the Egyptian historians was to be identified
with the ravagers whom the Israelites had driven out of Auaris.
Ahmose wrote that when Auaris was taken, the Hyksos retreated
to Sharuhen, in southern Palestine. But Manetho, many centuries
later, wrote that the Hyksos retreated into Palestine and built
Jerusalem; also that at a later date, when a leper colony in Auaris
revolted, these rebels summoned the Solymites (the people of
Jerusalem) and together conquered Egypt; that these Solymites
were extremely cruel to the population, and that one of the lepers,
Osarsiph, had changed his name to Moses.
This confused story reflects the Assyrian conquest of Egypt,
when Sennacherib and Esarhaddon invaded Palestine and Egypt
"with a great host of Assyrians and Arabs." The people of
Jerusalem never conquered Egypt.
The first wave of anti-Semitism in the east was spread much later
in the Persian Empire by the vizier, Haman, "the Agagite, the Jews'
enemy.5 Haman, who was of the seed of Agog, the Amalekite,6
conspired to destroy the Jewish population in Persia and Media.
We may imagine that the traditions of Haman's house were likely
to inspire this hatred. These traditions told how Haman's royal
forefather Agog had been dispossessed by a Jewish king and killed
by a Jewish prophet.
In the Greek world no signs of racial antipathy toward Jews can
be traced until the stories of Manetho began to circulate. The Jews



were occasionally looked upon as a mysterious people, but no
expression of animosity or contempt is preserved in the writings of
the old authors. The earliest references are by Theophrastus,
Clearchus of Soli, and Megasthenes,7 philosophers who flourished
at the end of the fourth and the beginning of the third century
before this era.
Theophrastus wrote:
They are a race of philosophers; they do not cease to occupy
themselves with the divinity.
And Clearchus of Soli wrote:
The Jews descended from the philosophers of India. The philosophers are called in
India Calanians and in Syria Jews. . . . The name of their capital is very difficult to
pronounce: it is called Jerusalem.
Clearchus told the story of a Jew from whom Aristotle learned
some of his wisdom during his journey in Asia. Clearchus quoted
the words of Aristotle on "the great and admirable soberness of this
Jew, and his self-restraint."
Also, of Pythagoras and Plato it is recorded that they were in
close contact with wise Jews and were anxious to learn from
them.8
Megasthenes,9 who lived in India between 302 and 291 B.C.,
wrote in his book Indica:
All the opinions expressed by the ancients about nature are found with the
philosophers foreign to Greece, with the Brahmans of India, and in Syria with those
who are called Jews.
These references to Jews in the Greek language are the only
ones in the extant Greek literature from before the time Manetho's
history appeared.
The hatred, never extinguished in the memory of posterity, for
the inhuman shepherd-conquerors was revived: the Jews were
identified with the descendants of the Hyksos. Inaugurated by
Manetho, an extensive Jew-baiting literature followed, and the



stories of Manetho were told and retold and adorned by many
writers.10 .Among them was Apion, against whom the apology
(Against Apion) of Josephus Flavius was directed. Josephus did not
try to cast doubt on the identification of the Jews with the Hyksos;
on the contrary, he approved it and even defended it in a most
categorical manner; his only reason for doing so was his wish to
establish the antiquity of the Jewish people with the help of
Manetho's stories.
Josephus played a tragic role in the days of the war in Galilee
and Judea and the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in the first
century of the present era. Starting as a soldier at the head of the
Galilean army, he ended as a renegade. His apology for the Jewish
case was considered a masterpiece and was often translated and
quoted by defenders of the Jewish people; but the defense of his
pen was worth as much as the defense of his sword.
Hatred of the Hyksos, burning in the generations of the ancient
Orient, found a target in the Jews.
An equally glowing hatred of the Amalekites persisted in the
memory of the Jews. A Jewish mother even today frightens her
child with an "Amalekite."
Hatred can last a long time even when its object is not alive.
How much stronger is that hatred if the hated ones did not dissolve
their national existence a thousand years before on the Arabian
peninsula, but are still supposed to exist? The Egyptian author saw
in the Jew the wretched seed of cruel tyrants. Subsequently Greek
and Roman authors established in their writings the object for the
never dying necessity to hate. Insinuations were heaped one on the
other, and monstrous stories were invented about the head of an
ass which the Jews kept in their temple and worshiped, and about
the human blood they sucked.
The curse on the Amalekites became a curse on the Israelites.
"Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the
heaven." It was blotted out. No one knew any longer that the
Amalekites were the Hyksos.



The Israelites endured much suffering from this distortion of
history. They bore their pain for being identified with the Hyksos.
The persecution started with the misstatements of Manetho, the
Egyptian, whose nation was freed from the Hyksos by the Jews. In
later years anti-Semitism has been fed from many other sources.
1 . . . thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou west a stranger in his land" (
Deuteronomy 23:7).

World History in the Balance
The proofs of the identity of the Hyksos and the Amalekites have
been summarized to make the case as strong as possible. It is not
merely the solution of the enigma of the identity of the Hyksos that
is at stake. The entire structure of ancient history hangs in the
balance. If the catastrophes of the Papyrus Ipuwer and of the Book
of Exodus are identical; if, further, the Hyksos and the Amalekites
are one, then world history, as it really occurred, is entirely different
from what we have been taught.
Thus, establishing the period in which the Exodus took place
becomes of paramount importance: Israel did not leave Egypt
during the New Kingdom, as all scholars maintain, but at the close



of the Middle Kingdom. The entire period of the Hyksos lies in
between; the expulsion of the Hyksos was neither identical with the
Exodus nor did it take place before the Exodus. The Hyksos were
expelled by Saul; their later destruction was the work of Joab,
soldier of David. David lived in the tenth century, and Saul was his
predecessor on the throne. The expulsion of the Hyksos is put at
1580, which leaves almost six centuries unaccounted for.
Whose history is to be Moved by these centuries? Is it possible to
place David in the sixteenth century before this era? No student of
ancient history will see the slightest possibility of altering the history
of the kings of Jerusalem by a single century, much less by six,
without disrupting all established data and concepts. The biblical
annals record the succession of the kings of Judah and of Israel,
king after king, and give the years of their reigns. If there are, here
and there, some discrepancies or difficulties in the double account
of the kings of Judah and of Israel, they are of entirely different
dimensions, and may amount at most to one or two decades, but
not hundreds of years.
Hebrew history is closely related to Assyrian history, and with the
help of common data the chronological tables have been made so
accurate that while there may be room to question whether
Sennacherib in his third campaign invaded Palestine in - 702 or in
- 700, there can be no question whether this Assyrian king came to
the Jerusalem of Hezelciah in - 1280 or thereabouts. While there
may be a difference of opinion whether to lengthen or shorten the
reign of one or another of the kings by comparing the accounts of
the Book of Kings and the Book of Chronicles, the dates of events
in which Assyria or Babylonia participated are, in a number of
instances, established with precision, to within a year.
The period of the kings of Jerusalem ended with the exile to
Babylon in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed Jerusalem
in - 587 or - 586. Cyrus, the Persian, in the second half of the same
century, conquered the Chaldean-Babylonian Empire. The Persian
rule, king after king, the years of each of them known from many



contemporary Greek authors, lasted until Alexander the Great.
Where are the six hundred years to be inserted?
Is it conceivable that about six centuries have disappeared from
Jewish history, and that because of this disappearance the history
contracted so greatly? Where is the historical place of this chasm?
There is not a trace of a historical chasm. Even with the greatest
effort of the imagination the succession of centuries cannot be torn
apart to make room for additional ones.
On the other hand, how can a history be shortened? Egyptian
history is firmly settled too. Dynasty after dynasty ruled in Egypt;
from the beginning of the New Kingdom in about - 1580 until the
time of the Persian rule in - 525, when Cambyses overran Egypt,
and down to the Greek conquest in - 332 by Alexander the Great,
the time is filled with successions of dynasties and kings. Not only is
the Egyptian past fixed; Egyptian chronology is the rule and the
standard for the entire world history.
The ages of the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures of Crete and
the Greek mainland are placed in time in accordance with the
chronological scale of Egypt. The Assyrian, Babylonian, and Hittite
histories, too, are distributed and divided on the world timetable
according to their contacts with Egyptian history. Some events of
the Assyrian and Babylonian past concerned the Jewish people,
and the history of the Double-Stream countries is synchronized
with Jewish history; on the other hand, some events of the Assyrian
and Babylonian past involved Egypt, and the history of the
countries of the Double Stream is synchronized with Egyptian
history, which is about six hundred years behind when compared
with the history of Judah and Israel. By what prodigious, or rather
illogical, procedure could this have come about?
If the fault lies in Egyptian history, the only possibility is that
events of that history are described twice, and six hundred years
are repeated. It would follow, then, that the events of many other
peoples are described in wrong succession. But this seems to be a
preposterous statement, which insults the sound judgment of many



generations of the entire scholarly world, whoever learned,
investigated, wrote, and taught history.
Both these alternatives appear to be chimerical: that six hundred
years disappeared from the history of the Jewish people, or that six
hundred years were doubled in the history of Egypt and in the
history of many other peoples as well.
But that in Jerusalem it was the tenth century while in Thebes it
was the sixteenth is an absolute impossibility. We shall do better to
admit that the mistake lies, not with history, but with the historians,
and that by juxtaposing the two histories, century by century, either
six hundred missing years will be found in Palestine or six hundred
"ghost" years will be discovered in Egypt.
I shall set down the events of the time following the expulsion of
the Hyksos-Amalekites, reign by reign and age by age, in Egypt
and in Palestine, and we shall see whether they, too, coincide and
for how long. And if the tenth and the ninth centuries in Palestine
are found to be coeval with the sixteenth and fifteenth centuries in
Egypt we shall have additional proof that the identity of the Hyksos
and the Amalekites is not at all an arbitrary assumption. By going
through the ages we shall soon be able to establish where the fault
lies. Even before we know which of the schemes is wrong we may
conclude that the histories of peoples which are in harmony with
the two schemes are in a most chaotic state.



Chapter III
THE QUEEN OF SHEBA
Two Suzerains
THE beginning of the famous Eighteenth Dynasty, whose kings were
native Egyptians and who freed Egypt from the Hyksos, coincided with
the beginning of the line of Kings in Judea. Saul delivered the fatal blow
to the hegemony of the Amalekites Hyksos; David established Jerusalem
as his capital; in the time of Solomon the realm achieved its splendor.
According to the scriptural narrative, Solomon had one thousand and
four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen; he reigned over
all the land from the river Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and the
border of Egypt. The kings of Arabia paid him tribute, and presents were
brought from near and far, vessels of silver and of gold, garments and
spices, armor and horses. He made cedars in Jerusalem "to be as
sycamore trees in the vale of abundance." He built a palace with a great
throne of ivory, and a house of worship. Vessels therein were of gold; of
gold were the drinking cups of his palace. Six hundred threescore and six
talents of gold came yearly to his treasury as tribute, besides the income
from the traffic of the merchants (I Kings 10:14-15).
The kingdom of Egypt, after regaining independence under Ahmose,
a contemporary of Saul, also achieved grandeur and glory under
Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Hatshepsut, and Thutmose . Egypt,
devastated and destitute in the centuries under the rule of the Hyksos,
rapidly grew in riches.
The two realms, freed from the same oppressor, entered into trade
relations and into relations of kinship.
King Solomon took an Egyptian princess to be one of his wives,
probably his chief wife. The Scriptures do not preserve her name. It is
known only that her father, the pharaoh, made an expedition against



southern Palestine, the home of the Philistines and the Canaanites,
burned Gezer, and gave it as dowry to his daughter (I Kings 9:16).
The pharaoh, whose name is also omitted in the Scriptures - lat-mudic
tradition calls him Shishak - was, according to the scheme presented
here, Thutmose I, the third king of the New Kingdom. Only a few lines of
his annals are extant. Besides a military expedition into Nubia, which he
subdued, he undertook an Asiatic campaign "and overthrew the
Asiatics." "After these things" the pharaoh "journeyed to Retenu to wash
his heart among the foreign countries."1
Nothing positive can be established with these meager remnants
except that the pharaoh actually crossed the Sinai Peninsula, waged a
campaign of conquest in Philistia, and then proceeded peacefully to
Palestine (Retenu), where he had some cause for rejoicing.
Although very sparse records are preserved from the reign of
Thutmose 1,2 he was often mentioned as the father of Queen
Hatshepsut. He shared the throne with her and made her his successor.
Hatshepsut, the great and celebrated queen, left inscriptions, has-reliefs,
and figures of herself in abundance.
If the Exodus took place at the end of the Middle Kingdom, if,
furthermore, the Hyksos rule was that of Amalekite invaders, then
Queen Hatshepsut, whose huge statues confront us in the high-ceilinged
halls of museums, must have been a contemporary of Solomon. Can it
actually be that no memory of her was preserved in the annals of
Jerusalem? Two lands in the process of developing their foreign relations
and trade could hardly have been out of touch during the reigns of
Solomon and Hatshepsut, neither of whom broke the peace of their
countries.






Both of them built palaces and magnificent temples; both enriched
their countries, not by war, but by peaceful enterprises; each possessed a
fleet on the Red Sea and sent it on adventurous expeditions;3 the reigns
of both were the glorious periods of these two countries.
If Solomon was really a renowned king, as the Hebrew sources
describe him, then the absence of any contact between this queen and
this king is difficult to explain. It would, indeed, be very singular, for
these two rulers were no ordinary occupants of throne halls, but very
excellent suzerains.
Nor would it fit our notion of the adventure-loving character of Queen
Hatshepsut, or the words of praise: "Thy name reaches as far as the
circuit of heaven, the fame of Makere (Hatshepsut) encircles the sea,"4
and "her fame has encompassed the Great Circle" (ocean).5 Neither
would it accord with our idea of King Solomon, whose capital was
visited by ambassadors from many countries° and who had personal
contact with many sovereigns: "And all the kings of the earth sought the
presence of Solomon" (II Chronicles 9:23), and "all the earth sought to
Solomon. . . ." (I Kings 10:24.)
Was the queen of Egypt excluded from "all the kings"?
1 Broasted, Records, Vol. II, Sec. 81.
2 Thutmose I described the domain of his influence - from Ethiopia to the land of "the inverted
water - the river that flows upstream." It is generally supposed that he meant the Euphrates, as the
Egyptians had the idea that a river like the Nile must flow from the south to the north.
The northernmost area of Thutmose's domain was Edom in southern Palestine. By "the river that
flows upstream" is meant the Jordan. This will be explained at length in another place. But if the
Egyptians were amazed by a river flowing southward, it would be the Jordan, which is closer to
Egypt, rather than the Euphrates.
3 Scholars following the established construction of history could not close their eyes to the
similarity of these enterprises: ". . . ambitious and inventive was Solomon's policy of . . .
developing a maritime route on the Red Sea. The old vigor of Egypt as displayed by Queen
Hatshepsut in her navigation of those waters had long since disappeared." J. A. Montgomery,
Arabia and the Bible ( Philadelphia, 1934), p. 176.

From Where Did the Queen of Sheba Come?
The visit of the most illustrious of Solomon's guests is recorded twice in
the Scriptures. Chapter 9 of the Second Book of Chronicles repeats
almost verbatim the story of Chapter 10 of the First Book of Kings.
And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon
with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices,
and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she
communed with him of all that was in her heart.
Is this story a fairy tale? Did a fairy queen come from a mysterious
land with jewels and other marvelous things? If she really came, did she
find a splendid and generous king in Jerusalem and not a poor vassal
prince who was never mentioned in the history of other countries?
Many are inclined to believe that there is no historical basis for this
legendary romance; others, who saw not fiction but real adventure in the
story, unsuccessfully sought some historical remnants of the life and reign
of the Queen of Sheba.1
The land over which the Queen of Sheba ruled is identified by most
scholars as the district of Saba (Sheba) in southern Arabia, the land of
the "Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands,
and beautiful crowns upon their heads" (Ezekiel 2S:42). The Yemenites,
the inhabitants of the land of Saba ( Sheba) in Arabia Felix, believe that
the Queen of Sheba was their queen, and with rich oriental imagery they
ornament the story of her life and of her visit to Jerusalem. This view is
supported by the Koran (Sura XXVII).
But Ethiopia vies with Arabia for the fame of the Queen of the South.
The kings of Ethiopia claim descent from Menelik, a son of Solomon and
the Queen of Sheba, who, they insist, was their queen. They possess
medieval manuscripts, with texts composed in the early Christian
centuries, which carry this tradition.2
Neither of the two Talmuds contains any clear historical reference to
the mysterious adventurous queen.3 However the opinion is expressed
in the Talmud that "Sheba" in the name Queen of Sheba is not a
geographical designation but a personal name.4 The very numerous
inscriptions of southern Arabia are silent on the Queen of Sheba.
Travelers have been unsuccessful though they have turned every stone
in southern Arabia which promised an answer to the riddle.5 The



genealogy of the Abyssinian emperors, who wished to be recognized as
the seed of Solomon and the Queen of the South, is accepted with the
same lack of belief as all similar genealogies of kings and demigods.
Research, which produced many treatises and commentaries, after
exhausting all material, arrived at the conclusion expressed by one
writer: "We shall never know whether the queen who visited Solomon
was a pure-blooded Abyssinian or an Arab queen from Yaman [Yemen]
or Hadramaut or some other part of the great Arabian peninsula. But the
tradition that some 'Queen of the South' did visit Solomon is so old and
so widespread, that a kernel of historical fact, however small, must be
hidden somewhere in it."6
Was the Queen of the South a queen of Saba (Sheba) in Arabia, or of
Ethiopia, or was she a legendary character from a fairyland?
In the Jewish Antiquities of Josephus we find the story of the Queen of
Sheba7 ' introduced by these words:
Now the woman who at that time ruled as queen of Egypt and Ethiopia was thoroughly
trained in wisdom and remarkable in other ways, and, when she heard of Solomon's virtue
and understanding, was led to him by a strong desire to see him which arose from the things
told daily about his country.8
Here we have a clear indication: "queen of Egypt and Ethiopia." But
Egyptian history, being removed some six hundred years from the
synchronical point with Israelite history, could not present a woman
ruling in Egypt and Ethiopia.9
The history of Egypt, moved along six hundred years and put at the
right place, would make it difficult to explain the absence of any
reference to Queen Hatshepsut in the Hebrew annals. Is the story of the
Queen of Sheba the story of Queen Hatshepsut?
The most convincing proof, of course, would be presented if a record
of the voyage to Jerusalem by Queen Hatshepsut were found and if it
conformed with the account in the annals of the kings of Jerusalem.
The record was written. It is preserved. And it conforms.

Where Did Queen Hatshepsut Go?
A magnificent temple called "The Most Splendid of Splendors" at Deir el
Bahari near Thebes in Egypt was built against a semicircular wall of cliffs.
"These cliffs of white limestone, which time and sun have coloured rosy
yellow, form an absolutely vertical barrier. They are accessible only from
the north by a steep and difficult path leading to the summit of the ridge
that divides Deir el Bahari from the wild and desolate valley of the
Tombs of the Kings?1
On the walls of this temple are engraved bas-reliefs describing the life
and the most important events of the reign of Queen Hatshepsut. One
series tells the story of her divine birth, her father being the god Ra.
Another series, called the Punt reliefs, which are opposite to and
symmetrical with the first series, tells the story of a journey to the land of
Punt or the Holy Land (Divine, God's Land).
"These are undoubtedly the most interesting series of reliefs in Egypt. .
. . They are as beautiful in execution as they are important in content.2
It must have been a blessed land, the goal of the expedition in ships
propelled by sail and oar. It had all the features of a mythical land of
happy fields and hills. White men of a north-Semitic3 or Caucasian race
4 lived there, proud and handsome; they composed the bulk of the
population. Then, the pictures show, there were a few entirely different,
dark-skinned men in Punt. Animals were led on ropes; they are identified
as having belonged to African fauna - a number of monkeys and a
panther.5 The plants were indigenous to the southern Arabian coast.6



Plants about which the inscription says, "Since the beginning of the
world never were seen trees like these," were brought from Punt by the
Egyptian expedition. Besides these trees, there were gifts of ivory and
ebony, gold and silver and precious stones. These Queen Hatshepsut
brought home, a heavy load, in her ships.
Where was the land of Punt?
Many theories concerning the location of the land of Punt have been
advanced, but it has remained uncertain. Were it not for the bas-reliefs
with the exotic animals and plants, the whereabouts of Punt probably
would be no problem.
The name of Punt or Divine (God's) Land is not accompanied by the
sign designating a foreign country, showing that the Egyptians regarded
Punt as a land affiliated in some way with Egypt. In a number of
Egyptian inscriptions Punt is mentioned as situated to the east of Egypt.
In an utterance by Amon, dating from the time of Amenhotep , of the
later part of the Eighteenth Dynasty, there are the following words:
"When I turn my face to the sunrise . . . I cause to come to thee the
countries of Punt."7
An official of the Sixth Dynasty left a laconic record stating that he
visited Byblos and Punt eleven times.8 Byblos was the old capital of
Phoenicia; its ruins are eighteen miles north of Beirut. Having been
visited eleven times by the officer coming from Egypt, and being
mentioned together with Byblos, Punt must have been associated with
Byblos.
The name Punt or Pont can be traced to "Pontus, father of Poseidon
and Sidon," as narrated by Sanchoniaton, the early Phoenician writer.9
Sidon was a Phoenician metropolis.
There are also numerous inscriptions that mention products of Punt
and God's Land as being obtained in Palestine (Retenu), and we shall
read some of them in the following chapter. In an inscription in the tomb
of a general of Thutmose IV, Palestine (Retenu) is called God's Land; a
building inscription of Amenhotep one generation later also refers to
Palestine as God's Land.
But all these points were not even considered by scholars who tried to
locate Punt or God's Land. As the bas-reliefs of Deir el Bahari showed
exotic animals and plants, zoologists and botanists were called by the



historians to determine the place to which they were indigenous.10 °
Palestine and Syria were never included among the possibilities.
The elaborate pageant, the fauna and flora, created a division of
opinion among the scholars. The majority of the population is north
Semitic or Caucasian. The animals and the few negroids are African.
The plants are south-Arabian. God's (Divine) Land is often mentioned in
the Egyptian inscriptions as the land which produced frankincense, and
if the rare trees were these frankincense plants, they must have been of
the Arabian variety, which is rich in foliage; the Somalian frankincense
does not leaf as depicted in the bas-relief.' 11
To account for the presence of the white people was easiest: they
might have migrated to that country. 12 The people of Punt were
Phoenicians, as the name implies, and their presence in Somaliland
could be inferred, as some authorities thought, from a passage in
Herodotus, who wrote that the Phoenicians at an early date came from
the Eritrean Sea to the Mediterranean,13 and this seemed to sustain the
theory that Punt was in eastern Africa. The Puntites would have been
the ancestors of the Phoenicians.14
The statement of an official of the Old Kingdom that he visited Byblos
and Punt eleven times was understood to mean that the official visited
Byblos in Syria eleven times and Punt in eastern Africa or southern
Arabia eleven times.15
The indication that Punt was to the east of Egypt complicated still
further the obscure problem of African fauna and Asiatic flora.
A review of opinions, taking a position chiefly for or against southern
Arabia and Somaliland, shows how hopelessly confused the problem
is.16 Did the expedition of Queen Hatshepsut undertake the voyage into
the faraway kingdom of Saba, whence six hundred years later a fairy
queen came to Solomon in Jerusalem?17 Or did the expedition of
Hatshepsut arrive at the Somali shore, the other land which claimed to
be the birthplace of the Queen of Sheba?
With regard to the origin of the Queen of Sheba, the same two lands
southern Arabia and the highland of Somali with Ethiopia - entered into
the dispute.



Like the biblical scholars who exhausted all means of finding out
whether the Queen of the South came from Saba or from Ethiopia, the
Egyptologists exhausted every source without arriving at a final decision
as to whether Queen Hatshepsut sent her expedition to southern Arabia
or to the African coast. It was certain only that somewhere, outside of
Egypt but in touch with it, was a blessed land of riches called Punt, also
the Divine, Holy, or God's Land,18 with a population of handsome men,
with exotic animals, with marvelous plants.
Finally, a Solomon's judgment was urged, and the land of Punt was
divided between the Arabian Land of Saba and African Somaliland19
In the previous chapters a synchronism was presented between
Egyptian and Hebrew histories. Queen Hatshepsut was found to be a
contemporary of Solomon.
If Queen Hatshepsut were herself the Queen of the South, she, of
course, would have come neither from Saba in Arabia nor from the
Somali coast of Ethiopia, but from Thebes in Egypt; her destination most
probably would have been neither southern Arabia nor Somaliland, but
Jerusalem.
Was the Divine Land the region of Jerusalem? Palestine is east of
lower Egypt; it had a white north-Semitic population. But the flora and
fauna of the bas-reliefs, both foreign to Palestine, would appear to be a
double anomaly.
I shall now pass on to the description of the expedition. The rare
plants, the animals, and the men (negroids) will not only cease to be a
hindrance to the identification here proposed, but will strongly support it.
After that the identification will be tested against other references to Punt
and Divine Land in Egyptian inscriptions.

The Way from Thebes to Jerusalem
The shortest route from Thebes to Jerusalem is not along the Nile and
the coast of the Mediterranean; the Red Sea route is only a little more
than half its distance: from Thebes to Coptos, a short distance up the
Nile, and then to el-Qoseir,1 a harbor on the Red Sea, then by ship
across the Red Sea and along the Aqaba (Aelana) Gulf, and from Aqaba
overland to Jerusalem.
Besides being much shorter, this route was preferred for various other
reasons. The way across the Sinai Peninsula was not safe: It led through
the last settlements of the Amalekites and Philistines, through Auaris and



Gezer. Thutmose I, the father of Hatshepsut, carried on a campaign in
this region, clearing it of rebellious bands of Amalekites and Philistines,
and burning Gezer. The seaway was safer. Also a voyage by ship was
more comfortable for the queen than a long journey in a chariot or in a
palanquin, stopping at night to rest in tents pitched in the middle of the
desert.
Still another reason for traveling by sea was probably Hats hepsut’s
desire to display the splendor of her new fleet.
Solomon built a harbor in the Aqaba Gulf of the Red Sea.
KINGS 9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-Geber, which is beside Eloth,
on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
Since the great cataclysm, when the maritime nations were lost
together with their ships, daring ventures had been few and far between.
For a long time the Atlantic Ocean was agitated by tectonic ruptures in a
subsiding bottom.2
When the Amalekites were destroyed and their allies, the Philistines,
subjugated, the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon resumed their full
maritime activity and sent their ships to "the Great Circle" (the ocean).
Soon they recognized the advantages of the southern route, by the Red
Sea, to the overseas countries.
The Phoenician king of Tyre, Hiram, sought an alliance with King
Solomon and his friendship, possibly because of the naval base of Ezion
Geber in the land of Edom, vassal to Solomon. In disregard of their
practice of allowing no one to know the secrets of their voyages, the
Phoenicians took the sailors of Solomon with them.
I KINGS 10:22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram. . . .
9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with
the servants of Solomon.
To all the other reasons for choosing the maritime route from Thebes
to Palestine, this, too, may be added: the queen was interested in visiting
the new harbor from which the Phoenician and Hebrew fleets were
starting their three-year sail to Ophir.
1 Since olden times the harbor of el-Qoseir on the Red Sea has been mentioned as the starting
point of travel to the Divine Land.
2 Plato, Timaeus, 25.



Paruah Met the Herald of the Queen
Solomon inspected Ezion-Geber before the queen arrived. "Then went
Solomon to Ezion-Geber, and to Eloth . . ." (II Chronicles 8:17). And it is
here that one would expect the expedition to land. A few lines after the
above passage in Chronicles the story of the visit of the Queen of Sheba
begins.
In the Scriptures it is not said that the Queen of Sheba made the first
part of her journey by ship. But in rabbinical writings it is recounted of
the queen that she arrived on a ship after a long voyage by sea. The
Queen of Sheba "assembled all the ships of the sea, and loaded them
with the finest kinds of wood, and with pearls and precious stones."1/sup
Before the queen undertook the voyage a preliminary exploring
mission was sent out. The record of the visit of this mission is preserved
in the Haggada.2 The Koran3 also tells of the preliminary expedition:
"Said she [the Queen of Sheba]: '0 ye chiefs . . I am going to send to
them a gift, and will wait to see with what the messengers return."4
In the lower corner of the bas-relief in Deir el Bahari is depicted a
landing place. From the right a "king's messenger" advances at the head
of his soldiers; from the left a chief approaches. A line of water with fish
swimming about serves to indicate that the place is on the coast. The
chief is called "a chief of Punt P'-r'-hw" (Perehu or Paruah). On a tent is
written: "Pitching the tent of the king's messenger and his army on the
myrrh-terraces of Punt on the side of the sea."5 Since it is placed on the
extreme lower part of the mural, a position of minor importance, this
picture probably shows the preliminary expedition or the arrival of the
herald of the queen.
Paruah must have been Solomon's representative in the land of Edom,
possibly an Edomite vassal of his.
Among the twelve governors of King Solomon - at a later period in his
reign (when some of these officials were his sons-in-law) - one was a son
of Paruah (I Kings 4:17). Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, was governor
in Ezion-Geber and Eloth; his father, apparently, administered the same
region!6
On the picture Paruah is an elderly man with no insignia of sovereign
power. He is accompanied on this mission by his wife, disfigured by



elephantiasis, and a few other members of his family, which indicates
that he and his family were residents and probably natives of the place;
he appears to have been the chief of Ezion-Geber.
The landscape is consequently that of Edom. We see the small
buildings with penthouses, sometimes constructed on piles. The
penthouse, a room reached by a ladder from the outside, may be the
"alia" which we find in the Scriptures.
1 Ginzberg, Legends, IV, 144.
2 Ibid.
3 The Koran, Sura XXVII (trans. E. H. Palmer).
4 Also in Kebra Nagast (trans. Budge), the Ethiopian legend about "the Queen of the South," an
Ethiopian emissary by the name of Tamrin, possessor of three and seventy ships and leader of a
merchant caravan, visited Jerusalem and on returning to his queen "he related unto her how he
had arrived in the country of Judah and Jerusalem . . . and all that he had heard and seen."
5 According to the reading "on both sides of the sea," the harbor was situated on opposite shores.
Ezion-Geber was built by Solomon on the Gulf of Aqaba, where both shores can be seen.
6 It appears that the last word in I Kings 4:16 belongs to the next verse, and the last word of 4:17
to the following verse. The reading then would be: ". . . and in Aloth Jehoshaphat the son of
Paruah." In this case the son remained governor where his father had served in the same capacity,
Aloth and Eloth being the same. In a context having no relation to the question presented here,
Albright (Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society, V [19251, 35) made the same suggestion that
the place Aloth be transferred to the next verse, into the domain of Jehoshaphat, son of Paruah.
See also J. W. Jack, Samaria. in Ahab's Time (Edinburgh, 1929), p. 95.
Hatshepsut Led the Expedition to the Divine Land
The next picture shows the departure of a fleet of five vessels; three are
under sail, while two are still moored. The inscription reads: "Sailing in
the sea, beginning the goodly way toward God's Land, journeying in
peace to the land of Punt. . ."1
This is an exceedingly beautiful bas-relief of the fair fleet of the queen,
with prows curved like lotuses, with tall masts and flying sails. Each ship
had a crew of about fifty men to a shift, half of them on either side of the
ship. It is probable that the fleet consisted of more than five ships as the
pictures are partially destroyed. This was "the very great company" (II
Chronicles 9:1).
The queen herself is not shown on a ship. This is in accord with the
rules of Egyptian art: the Egyptian artist did not picture a royal person



among the common people; the august likeness must not humble herself
by being in the company of common sailors. Kings and queens were
drawn oversize like giants among dwarfs. Queen Hatshepsut was
portrayed beside the ships, and her figure was taller than the masts. Of
course a figure as tall as that could not have been placed on the deck.
This manner of representation, normal from the Egyptian point of
view, was the reason for a curious oversight. The expedition to the
Divine Land is described in modern histories of Egypt as an expedition
sent by the queen. But it is clearly apparent that she herself participated
in this voyage.
The very importance ascribed to this expedition, which makes it the
most prominent event of her reign,2 leads one to infer that it was her
own experience. Of all the events of her reign it was chosen to be
chiseled on the wall of the temple of the Most Splendid of Splendors as a
counterpiece to the depiction of her divine birth. If it were an ordinary
commercial expedition to Punt, why should the records have
perpetuated it so elaborately and with such pomp?
In previous times persons and missions had already been sent to Punt,
but only meager and prosaic data are preserved .3 Punt must have been
close to Egypt; this is intimated in various references on Egyptian
monuments, such as the one, already cited, in which an. official, who
lived at the time of the Sixth Dynasty, mentioned that he "had gone
eleven times to Byblos and Punt."
The fact that Punt was "written without the sign indicating a foreign
country" ( together with its frequent mention in inscriptions) "seems to
show that the Egyptians considered they were in some way connected
with that country."4 Why, then, would the queen create such excitement
over the visit there and acclaim it in great festivals, unless she herself
were the visitor? Would the meeting of some royal messenger with a
chief Paruah have been an event that the queen would have wanted to
immortalize as a thing "that had never happened"?
Queen Hatshepsut undertook the journey like a devout pilgrim who,
hearing an inner bidding, takes staff in hand:
. . a command was heard from the great throne, an oracle of the god himself, that the ways
to Punt should be searched out, that the highways to the myrrh-terraces should be penetrated:
"I will lead the army on water and on land, to bring marvels from God's land for this god, for
the fashioner of her beauty. . . . 5/sup



It was an oracle or a mysterious voice that Queen Hatshepsut heard
within her, and she thought it was her god.
Like the Punt inscription, the Haggada, and Josephus, too, describe
this strong, imperative desire that inspired the queen and that was
considered a divine command.6
There is no known precedent of a woman on the throne of Egypt;7
there is also no known previous instance of a ruler of Egypt paying a visit
of homage to a foreign sovereign.
The ships of Hatshepsut rode the waves under full sail; the crew toiled
at the oars. The route led the royal fleet into the narrow channel of the
Aelana (Aqaba) Gulf. In the days of Amalekite sovereignty this region
was visited by neither Israelites nor Egyptians. This journey of the queen,
therefore, was an exploring expedition.
It is a perilous gulf. If a north wind enters this channel it may capsize
the careless sailor, breaking his mast in a whirlwind. In the time of
Solomon this danger was probably not apprehended.
The steep, snow-capped massif of Mount Sinai, towering at the
entrance to the gulf, the shallow water at the mouth lying among reefs
and coral isles, the intense blue of the water as the gulf suddenly
deepens, and the red slopes of the Edom highland, crimson at dawn,
scarlet in the twilight, give this silent chasm an eerie character.
I have led them [the company of the expedition] on water and on land, to explore the waters
of inaccessible channels, and I have reached the myrrh-terraces.8
The words, "I have led them on water and on land," indicate that the
voyage did not end at the coast (Ezion-Geber ); from there the queen
with her royal train proceeded on land. The caravan moved toward
Jerusalem "with great splendor and show of wealth" (Josephus ); "the
camels were laden with gold and various spices and precious stones"; the
resplendent pilgrims to the city of wisdom were escorted by the royal
guard.
The queen and her train, including her royal artist, were obviously
impressed by the handsome appearance of the Israelite warriors. What
did the ancient Israelites look like?



We have been accustomed to seeing the Syrian prisoners sculptured
by the Egyptian craftsmen of later kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and
also of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. The beards of the
captives are round and untrimmed, "socratic," the figures helpless; for the
most part they are portrayed at the moment of their execution. But here
on the Punt reliefs the appearance of the dwellers in God's Land is
dignified; their noses are aquiline, their eyes set deep, their chins
protruding, their beards resembling the beard of the god Ra.9 It is
unprecedented, and it never happened again, that the appearance of
foreign soldiers, pictured by the Egyptians, should express more nobility
and grace than the figures of the Egyptians themselves.
The impression the Judean guard made on the guests is also told in a
legend about the visit of the Queen of Sheba King Solomon, who
remained in Jerusalem to await his august guest, sent a procession of
handsome youths to meet her. They were "like the sunrise, the evening
star and the lily,"10 and the queen was amazed.

The Glorious Region of God's Land



The route goes up the valley of the Araba, leaving stony Petra on the
right, and runs along the Dead Sea, a scene of desolation, where lava
gushed from the interior of the earth and congealed in fantastic forms. In
the valley of ruined Jericho abundant springs watered gardens in the
desert, and they budded and blossomed the greater part of the year.
The road rises to Jerusalem. Here the slopes of the hills were cut in the
form of terraces, which are seen even today. Myrrh, cassia, nard, saffron,
and cinnamon, sweet spices, fragrant herbs, fruits, and roots were used
in the Temple of Jerusalem, and a great part of them was cultivated on
these terraces.1 Almonds, produced for trade, grew there,2 and aloes
used by the maidens of Judea to perfume their beds.3
The queen who came from the plains of Egypt later wrote on stone:
PUNT BELIEFS: I have reached the myrrh-terraces. It is a glorious region of God's land.4
She wondered at the pageant of the blooming hills; but the most
splendid groves of trees planted upon terraces were in the middle of
Jerusalem.
II CHRONICLES 9:11 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the
Lord, and to the king's palace . . . and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
"And the king received her gladly on her arrival and was studious to
please her in all ways, in particular by mentally grasping with ease the
ingenious problems she set him."5
Whether there was a likeness of Solomon on the bas-reliefs of the
temple of the Most Splendid is impossible to say. The Egyptians would
have considered it a dishonor to see a picture of their queen in society
and as a guest in the house of a foreign ruler. Would she picture herself
with her host?
On the bas-reliefs she communes only with the god Amon. But several
of the pictures on that part of the mural which portrayed the sojourn in
God's Land have been erased: "Two thirds of the short wall on which
was sculptured the description of the Land of Punt is destroyed."6 In the
lower row there appear to have been huge figures, one of which was the
queen, as part of her cartouche between two defaced fields is still
recognizable. But if it was a text that was erased and not a likeness, what



was peculiar in this text that it had to be erased by the order of her
jealous successor, Thutmose?
Whether details of the queen's visit in the palace of Jerusalem were
originally pictured on the bas-relief or not, the strong impression which
the queen received there and which she expressed in Jerusalem, she
repeated in Thebes.
When the queen saw the palace of the king, "and the sitting of his
servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his
cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the
Lord, there was no more spirit in her" (I Kings 10:4-5 ).
She praised "the greatness of the marvels, which happened to her"
and wrote: "Never did the like happen under any gods who were before,
since the beginning" (Punt reliefs).7 In Thebes she had heard about the
land of the terraces, but what she saw exceeded her expectations.
PUNT BELIEFS: It was heard of from mouth to mouth by hearsay of the ancestors. . . .
The queen wished to see with her own eyes the land of which she had
heard marvelous reports. She decided to tread and to explore that land
("I have led them on water and land"); she reached that country ("I have
reached the myrrh-terraces"); and she found it glorious.
The stories of the Divine Land, which she had heard before, she
compared with what she herself witnessed.
In the Scriptures the words of the queen are not dissimilar:
I KINGS 10:6-7 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land
of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and behold, the
half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
Josephus wrote:
(She] was not able to contain her amazement at what she saw, but showed clearly how much
admiration she felt, for she was moved to address the king. . . . "All things indeed, 0, King,"
she said, "that come to our knowledge through hearsay are received with mistrust . . . it was
by no means a false report that reached us".8
The emphasis in these quotations and in the Punt inscription alike is
laid on the comparison of that which came "to our knowledge through
hearsay" with that which was witnessed. To know for herself, not through



hearsay, she had to visit the Divine Land, and so she undertook the
pilgrimage to the myrrh-terraces.
If the sovereign of Egypt, the land of plenty, was astonished at the
sight of Jerusalem's splendor, there might well be truth in the words of
the First Book of Kings: "King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the
earth for riches." The land seemed to the queen an abode of happy
men: "Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants. . . . Blessed be
the Lord thy God" (I Kings 10:8-9).
The queen described her impressions in the following sentences
addressed to the god Amon: "It is a glorious region of God's Land. It is
indeed my place of delight . . . I conciliated them by love that they might
give to thee praise."
The manner of expression ascribed to the Queen of Sheba in speaking
about King Solomon is not unlike that which Queen Hatshepsut used in
respect to herself: "because the Lord loved Israel for ever, therefore made
he thee king. . . ." (I Kings 10:9); "because he [Amon] so much loves the
King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Hatshepsut . ."
The queen, the guest, and the king, the host, exchanged precious gifts.
"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of
spices great abundance, and precious stones" (II Chronicles 9:9).
After the interpolation concerning the almug trees brought by
Solomon's navy from Ophir, the story proceeds: "And King Solomon
gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked. . . ."
What was the desire of the Queen of Sheba?

"The Desire of the Queen of Sheba"
The "desire of the Queen of Sheba" is pictured on the walls of the temple
of the Most Splendid. The gifts axe shown in the presentation scene, the
scene of the loading for the return voyage, the scene of the counting and
weighing after the return, and the scene of dedication to Amon.
The gifts were exchanged with:mutual generosity; but just as King
Solomon knew the weight of the gold he received, so Queen Hatshepsut
knew, after measuring and weighing, the exact weight of the precious
metals she received in the Divine Land. A scene of the bas-relief shows
the queen weighing the objects herself. The amount and size of the gifts
were exceedingly great.
PUNT BELIEFS: Reckoning the numbers, cramming up in millions, hundreds of thousands,
tens of thousands, thousands and hundreds: reception of the marvels of Punt1
She gave gold and received "green gold of the land of Amu" (landing
scene), and "silver and gold" (weighing scene). Silver, rare in antiquity,
was abundant in the Jerusalem of Solomon. "And the king made silver
to be in Jerusalem as stones" (I Kings 10:27); "silver . . . was nothing
accounted of in the days of Solomon" (I Kings 10:21). It sounds like an
exaggeration that silver was used for construction, but the inscriptions of
Hatshepsut's officials after the return of the expedition tell about a "house
of silver" and a "double house of silver" (inscriptions of Senmut2 and
Thutiy3 ), and a "floor wrought with gold and silver" (Thutiy).4
The queen gave "precious stones" (I Kings 10:10), and she received
"lapis lazuli, malachite, and every costly stone" (Punt reliefs).
Solomon and Hatshepsut vied with each other not only in gifts but
also in appreciation of the generosity of the other.
The queen gave spices in abundance and of the choicest varieties:
II CHRONICLES 9:9 . . . neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king
Solomon.
I KINGS 10:10 . . . there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen
of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
She desired myrrh and she received it, also in great quantities and of
the choicest kinds.



PUNT BELIEFS: Fresh myrrh (anti) in great quantities, marvels of the countries of Punt.
Never did the like happen under any gods who were before since the beginning.
The "best of myrrh" was counted in "millions" and found "without
number."
But more than all "marvels" the queen valued some precious trees.
PUNT BELIEFS: Thirty-one anti trees,5 brought as marvels of Punt. Never was seen the like
since the world was.
I KINGS 10;11-12 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in
from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. . . . There came no such almug
trees, nor were seen unto this day.
In both scriptural narratives the story of Hiram's navy that brought
back the exotic almug trees ( algum trees in Chronicles) from Ophir is
placed just between the verses about the presents which the Queen of
Sheba gave to Solomon and the words ". . . and
king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire." Now we
see that this interpolation was made not without reason. The trees were
brought from a distant island or continent and a part of them was given
to the queen guest. A picture shows how they were handed over.
The words, "never was seen the like since the world was," or "unto this
day" are alike in the Hebrew and Egyptian sources; the trees were a
genuine sensation and were admired like the plants and other "marvels"
brought quite two and a half millennia later by sailors returning from the
Western Hemisphere.
The queen received not only metals, minerals, and plants; living
animals were also among the royal gifts. Apes were brought to her by
servants of the king, and the accurate drawings show that they were of
the variety known as cynocephali.



Plate III: THE PRESENTATION OF GIFTS



In the same tenth chapter of the First Book of Kings we read that apes
were brought to Solomon by the navy of Tharshish.
I KINGS 10:22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: Once in
three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and
peacocks.
The apes given to the queen were brought from afar. Ivory, too, was
brought by the ships of Tharshish, and it was not lacking in the bounty
bestowed on the queen.
On the mural, over the vessels laden with jars of myrrh, ivory tusks,
wood, trees, and apes, is inscribed:
PUNT BELIEFS: The loading of the cargo-boats with great quantities of marvels of the land
of Punt, with all the good woods of the Divine Land, heaps of gum of anti, and trees of green
anti, with ebony, with pure ivory, with green gold of the land of Amu, with cinnamon wood,
Khesit wood, with balsam, resin, antimony, with cynocephali, monkeys, greyhounds, with
skins of panthers of the south, with inhabitants of the [south] country and their children.
Never were brought such things to any king since the world was.
The rare trees, the myrrh for incense, the ivory, the apes, the silver
and gold and precious stones were enumerated in both records, the
hieroglyphic and the scriptural. But Queen Hatshepsut mentioned also
"inhabitants of the [south] country and their children."
In the picture showing the presentation of gifts there are four rows of
kneeling men. The officials of the Divine Land are in the two lower rows,
and behind them is a line of men approaching with gifts; the kneeling
men of the upper middle row are called "chiefs of Irem," and are not
unlike the Egyptians; the uppermost row represents the men of Nm'yw or
Khenthenofer who look entirely different - they are dark-skinned and
have round heads and thick lips, and seem to be themselves gifts like the
animals and plants .6
The capital of the Divine Land being Jerusalem, who could be the
representatives of two other ethnic groups?
Two foreign lands and peoples are referred to in the chapter on the
Queen of Sheba. One is the neighboring people of Hiram, the king of
Tyre: ". . . navy of Hiram brought gold from Ophir." Ophir is the other
land, a faraway place mentioned in the account of the gifts. It is quite
conceivable that the officers of Solomon's ally, who brought the precious
things from afar, would participate in the ceremony of presentation. The



chiefs of Irem were therefore the messengers of Hiram.7 The men of
Nm'yw or Khenthenofer were probably the men of Ophir.8
Were the men from Ophir brought to Palestine? It is not mentioned in
the Scriptures that the navy of Hiram and Solomon brought natives from
Ophir. But Josephus Flavius wrote:
The king [Solomon] had many ships stationed in the Sea of Tarsus, as it was called, which he
ordered to carry all sorts of merchandise to the inland nations and from the sale of these there
was brought to the king silver and gold and much ivory and kussiim [Negroes] and apes.9
It has been supposed that Josephus mistook some other Hebrew word
of an older source and read it kussiim.10 The picture of the expedition to
Punt proves, however, that Josephus was not wrong: kussiim, the dark
men of Ophir, were apparently brought by the sailors of Hiram and
Solomon.
The murals therefore show us the ancient Hebrews, the ancient
Phoenicians, and probably some of the people of Ophir together.






The gifts were exchanged, and finally the days and weeks in
Jerusalem, an uninterrupted feast, came to their end.
JOSEPHUS: And the queen of Egypt and Ethiopia . . . returned to her own country.
The trees were transported in pots, each carried by four men and
along the gangway by six; the apes clung to the rigging; tusks of ivory
and jars filled the decks.
PUNT BELIEFS: Ye people, behold! The load is very heavy.

4 A "house of silver" may signify the treasury, but "a floor wrought with mid and silver" must be
understood as made of these metals.
5 Anti trees are termed myrrh by Breasted, and frankincense by Neville, identilled as Boswellia
Carteri by Schoff. Lucas, Ancient Egyptian Materials, p. 93.
6 In the opinion of some scholars the tribute-paying Negroes signify that beside the expedition to
Punt there was another expedition to the African region of Khenthenofer, the bas-reliefs bringing
together what geographically was divided.
7 Hiram was the traditional or often recurring name of the kings of Tyre. See Ginzberg, Legends, V,
878.
8 Ophir may signify generally Africa. Different theories place Ophir in Africa on its east coast, in
Arabia, in the Persian Gulf, the coast of India, Ceylon, Malaya, China, Spain, the West Indies, and
Peru, and also in many other countries. In the West Indies, in Australia, and on Madagascar there
are no apes. Peacocks abound in South America and Australia. The presence of silver in Ophir and
the three years needed for the voyage and return, starting in the Red Sea, are important
indications. Necho II sent a Phoenician expedition around Africa; they sowed and reaped on the
way, and it took four years to circumnavigate the continent.

the opinion of Weill.
The Ships Arrived at Thebes
The inscription to the next bas-relief states simply and clearly: "The ships
arrived at Thebes." Thebes is situated on the banks of the Nile. To reach
it by water, the ships must have sailed along the Nile, entering from the
Mediterranean.



A voyage from Punt in southern Arabia or in Somaliland to Thebes by
the sea route would have meant disembarking at el-Qoseir and
journeying overland from there to Thebes. As it is written and shown on
the relief that the fleet of ships landed at Thebes, a difficult dilemma
faced the commentators: either this part of the story was invented for
some obscure reason, or in the days of Hatshepsut there must have
existed a canal connecting the Nile with the Red Sea.1 But there is no
mention of such a canal in the days of Hatshepsut. It is known that a
waterway connecting the Nile and the Mediterranean with the Red Sea
was dug by Pharaoh Necho U, many hundred years after Hatshepsut,
and was finished much later, in the time of the Persian conquest.2
The Divine Land being recognized as the region of Jerusalem, no
problem is encountered in the arrival of ships at Thebes on the Nile.
Hatshepsut was obviously eager to see the two sea routes to Palestine,
and to display both her fleets, that of the Red Sea and that of the
Mediterranean. From Jerusalem she probably traveled to one of the
Phoenician seaports; from the Syrian shore the water route to Thebes
needs no artificial canal.

Terraces of Almug Trees
The completion of the journey was celebrated in Thebes by two festivals,
in the temple and in the palace. These celebrations were memorialized in
two great murals: the first contains a formal announcement to Amon of
the success of the expedition, the second to the royal court.
Makere [Hatshepsut] . . . the best of myrrh is upon all her limbs, her fragrance is divine dew,
her odor is mingled with Punt, her skin is gilded with electrum, shining as do the stars, in the
midst of the festival hall, before the whole land.1
The success of the expedition to the Divine Land was a personal
triumph for the queen, and she emphasized it. She decided to thank her
"heavenly father," the god Amon-Ra, for the success of the expedition by
erecting a new temple and by constructing terraces and planting in these
gardens the costly trees which she had brought from Punt.



The temple of the Most Splendid of Splendors, the ruins of which bear
these bas-reliefs, was built, terraces were laid out, and trees were
planted.
I have hearkened to my father . . . commanding me to establish for him a Punt in his house,
to plant the trees of God's land beside his temple, in his garden.2
The terraces in the Divine (God's) Land impressed the queen.
I KINGS 10:4-5 And when the queen of Sheba had seen . . . the house that he had built . . .
and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in
her.
This path ascended from the lower to the upper terraces planted with
algum trees (II Chronicles 9:11).



Plate V: Algum Trees



Queen Hatshepsut wrote on the wall of her temple that "the highways
of the myrrh-terraces" of the Divine Land were "penetrated," and "I have
reached the myrrh-terraces."
Similar terraces were built and planted facing the temple of the Most
Splendid of Splendors. They were planted with the trees about which it is
said in Kings: ". . . there came no such almug trees, nor were seen until
this day"; and Queen Hatshepsut wrote: "Never was seen the like since
the world was."
On the wall of the Deir el Bahari temple these trees are shown
planted, and the inscription reads:
Trees were taken up in God's Land and set in the ground [in Egypt] .3
The ruins of this temple disclose where and how the terraces were
situated, forming garden plateaus at rising levels.
Not only were the gardens imitated; the plan of the Temple in
Jerusalem, even the service, were followed as models.
1 Breasted, Records, Vol. II, Sec. 274.

3 Ibid., Sec. 294.
The Temple and Its Service Copied
The design of the Most Splendid of Splendors in Deir el Bahari did not
follow the contemporary Egyptian style. The earlier Egyptologists
recognized the striking foreign elements in that building, and the opinion
was expressed that the original of this imitation had been seen in Punt;1
during the expedition there a different style of art had been observed,
and after the return from Punt the temple in Deir el Bahari had been
erected. The queen even emphasized that she built a "Punt" The walls of
the temple were adorned with murals of the expedition to the Divine
Land, and the style of the temple itself was a memorial to the foreign
influence in architecture.
"It is an exception and an accident in the architectural life of Egypt."2
The temple of Deir el Bahari is regarded by many as the most
beautiful building in Egypt; it has the nobility of simplicity and it is free



from the heavy ornamentation of the temples of the Ramessides.3
The Divine Land being the area of Jerusalem, the temple in Deir el
Bahari must have had features in common with the Temple of King
Solomon. Although most of the temple of Queen Hatshepsut lies in ruin,
portions of it which are still standing give a fair idea of the structure as it
was before it was deserted and fell into decay.
In every generation attempts have been made to reconstruct the
Temple of Solomon in drawings or models, but the data in the First Book
of Kings did not provide sufficient details, and the reconstructors have
had to draw upon their own imagination.
The Temple of Jerusalem was built upon terraces planted with trees.
These terraces were cut by an ascending path. The processions of the
Levites started on the lowest terrace, and as they sang they mounted the
path. This explains the fact that some of their Psalms are called Shir ha
maaloth, "song of the ascent.".4
The Temple in Jerusalem contained a hall which was three times as
long as it was wide; in front of the hall was a vestibule; behind the hall
was a sanctuary; the large "sea" was most probably placed in the inner
court.
The temple at Deir el Bahari was built against a mighty cliff; the
Temple of Jerusalem stood upon an elevation with a distant chain of hills
running northeast, east, and south of it. This difference in location must
have influenced the architects to alter their plans.5
Slavish imitation would have dictated a location similar to that of the
original. But adoption of the style and general features of the plan is
probable, and this is implied in the words of the queen that she "built a
Punt." A comparison of the data in Kings with the remnants of the
temple of the Most Splendid may help to a better understanding of the
form of both buildings.
The temple of the Most Splendid of Splendors was a famous
sanctuary. Several scholars have tried to reconstruct its plan.6 This
temple was built upon terraces planted with the trees brought from the
Divine Land; the terraces were placed at progressively higher levels, and
a path leading to the temple mounted from one level to another. Rows of
pillars standing on a lower terrace supported the wall of the terrace
above. The court of the temple was surrounded by a colonnade; the



temple was divided into a vestibule, a hall, and a sanctuary. The ratio of
the width to the length of the hall was almost one to three.
The pillars supporting the terraces and surrounding the inner court
were rectangular in form; with their shadows, which changed with the
movement of the sun, they imparted a harmonious and majestic
appearance, which only rectangular stone rhythmically arranged can
give.
It is erroneous to assert that the Temple of Solomon was a poor
building of an obscure Asiatic chieftain who tried to construct a copy of
some Egyptian temple.7
Not only the temple architecture but also the temple service in Egypt
were given many new features. It was not until the temple of the Most
Splendid at Deir el Bahari was constructed that twelve priests, with a
high priest heading them, officiated before the altar. A relief on a
fragment, now in the Louvre Museum, shows twelve priests divided into
four orders, three in each order, and a damaged inscription over their
heads reads: ". . . in the temple of Amon, in Most Splendid of Splendors,
by the high priest of Amon in Most Splendid of Splendors . . ."8
The office of the high priest was established in the Egyptian service
only at the time of Queen Hatshepsut.9 This reform in the religious
service was introduced after the visit of the queen to the Divine Land,
where shortly before the House of the Lord had been completed.
In connection with her announcement that she made "a Punt" in the
garden of Amon, the queen issued a new edict: "Ye shall fulfill according
to my regulations without transgression of that which my mouth has
given," and this "in order to establish the laws of his [Amon's] house. . . ."
1 "Mariette, struck by the strange appearance of the edifice, thought that it betrayed a foreign
influence, and supposed that Queen Hatshepsut [Hatshepsut] had constructed it in the model of
some buildings seen by her officers in the land of Puanit." (Deir el Bahari [Leipzig, 1877], pp. 10
11, cited by G. Maspero in The Struggle of the Nations, p. 241, note 2.)
2 A. Mariette, Deir el Bahari, quoted by Naville in The Temple of Deir el Bahari, Introductory
Memoir, p. 1. However, a more ancient temple of similar architecture was discovered in the
vicinity; it probably represents, too, a Phoenician influence.
3 "Though she [Hatshepsut] was a sovereign fond of building and erecting edifices like that of Deir
el Bahari which are accounted the most beautiful left to us by Egyptian antiquity, she did not make
a useless display of gigantic buildings in the desire to dazzle the posterity as did Ramses II." Naville
in Davis, The Tomb of Hatshepsut, p. 73.

7 "Solomon . . . wanted palaces and gardens and a temple, which might rival, even if only in a
small way, the palaces and temples of Egypt and Chaldea, of which he had heard such glowing
accounts." Maspero, The Struggle of the Nations, p. 741. "Compared with the magnificent
monuments of Egypt and Chaldea, the work of Solomon was what the Hebrew kingdom appears
to us among the empires of the ancient world - a little temple suited to a little people." Ibid., p. 747.
8 Breasted, Records, Vol. II, note to Sec. 679. "The queen was conscious of the resemblance of the
temple-gardens in Deir el Bahari and Punt. The service and equipment of the temple receive some
light from the mention of its High Priest, with twelve subordinate priests in four orders." Ibid., note
to Sec. 291.
9 Ibid., Sec. 388. But according to G. Lefebvre, the office of the high priest was already
established by Ahmose (Histoire des grands pretres d'Amon. de Karnak [Paris, 1929), p. 69).
The Origin of the Words "Pontifex" and "Punt"
The obscure origin of the word "pontifex," which means high priest, can
be traced here. This question had already been debated before the time
of Plutarch, and he quoted the opinions of the authorities without finding
any of them satisfactory. One ancient authority regarded "pontifex" as
composed of the Latin roots pons, pontis, "a bridge," and facio, "I make."
The philological conjecture was: The pontifex was a man who built
bridges, or the principal magistrate; the chief of the people, who united
in his person civil and religious prerogatives. This explanation is
obviously very strained. Another authority thought that the first pontiffs
were so called because sacrifices were supposed to have been made on
a bridge (faciebant in ponte).1 This explanation is even more strained.
The word "pontiff" is not of Latin origin. It is not derived from pons,
but probably from Punt. When it is said that Queen Hatshepsut, after
visiting Punt, built a "punt" for the god Amon, this means a sacred place
of worship. By erecting a "punt" in Egypt, Queen Hatshepsut also
introduced the institution of the high priest, copying the service of the
Temple in Jerusalem, built on a Phoenician model.
Solomon's alliance with Hiram, the king of the Phoenicians, explains
the strong Phoenician influence in the life of the kingdom of Judah and
Israel. This influence is stressed in the Scriptures in the story of the
erection of the Temple, built with the help of Hiram, who provided
Solomon with building material and with the chief craftsman, a man of



Hebrew-Phoenician origin (I Kings 7:13-14). Also the common
expedition to Ophir and the peaceful transfer of territory from the
domain of one king to that of the other (I Kings 9:11) might have
brought it about that the whole of Palestine at that time was called
Phoenicia.
The name Punt being the origin of the word "pontiff" (pontifex), what
is the origin of the name Punt?
In the Scriptures the Phoenicians are called "the men of Sidon and
Tyre" or "the men of Hiram"; the name Phoenicia does not appear.
"Phoenicians" was the name used by Greek and Latin authors since
Homer.2 Rome waged so-called "Punic Wars" against Carthage, which
was built by immigrants from Tyre.
It is believed that the Greek explanation of the word "Phoeni-cians" as
"the red men"3 is but a successful adjustment in the style of folk
etymology, although the travels of the Phoenicians to the Western
Hemisphere and their contacts with the cultures of the Mayas and Incas
were taken into consideration by many scholars who studied pre
Columbian America. The other Greek explanation of the word
"Phoenicia" as "the land of palms" is generally rejected .4
Pontus, father of Sidon, was a legendary ancestor of the Phoenicians,5
and their name could have been derived from him, or the name of the
mythological ancestor could have been derived from the name of the
country.
If Punt was originally the word for Phoenician temples, then it could
have been derived from the Hebrew word parrot, and in this case the
Phoenicians received their name from the houses of worship they built.6
Even before the conquest of Joshua the land of Jerusalem was called
in Egyptian inscriptions Divine Land, God's Land (Toneter). Was
Jerusalem a holy place before David conquered it, and even before the
arrival of the Israelites under Joshua?
In the Bible there is an allusion to the holiness of Jerusalem in early
times and to a sanctuary in that place. When the patriarch Abraham
returned from pursuing the kings of the north, who had captured his
kinsman Lot, "Melchizedek king of Salem [Jerusalem] brought forth
bread and wine: and he was the priest of the Most High God" ( Genesis
14:18).



The name Divine (or Holy) Land, given to the region of Jerusalem in
Egyptian inscriptions of the Old and Middle Kingdoms, casts light upon
the religious significance of Jerusalem and Palestine generally in the days
before David, even as early as the days when the Israelites were still
nomads. Since then and up to the present day they have been called
"the Holy City" and "the Holy Land."

Make-da and Make-ra
The rivalry between the Arabian and Ethiopian traditions for the Queen
of the South can be decided against the Arabian claim and in favor of
the Ethiopian, but only to the extent that she was the "queen of Egypt
and Ethiopia," which is the true description by Josephus; this does not
necessitate an approval of genealogical claims embodied in the
Ethiopian tradition.
Mohammed, who endorsed the Arabian claims, was obviously wrong.
He put into the mouth of Solomon the following words: "I have
compassed what ye compassed not; for I bring you from Seba [Saba] a
sure information: verily, I found a woman ruling over them, and she was
given all things, and she had a mighty throne; and I found her and her
people adoring the sun instead of God."1 The land of Saba (in Hebrew
Shwa), because of the similarity in name, had confused the writers on
the Queen of Sheba even before Mohammed borrowed the last sentence
of the quoted Sura from the Hebrew Haggada, which he probably had
heard from the Jewish teachers of Medina.



The Ethiopians are not satisfied merely to claim the Queen of the
South as their queen; they insist that a child was born of her liaison with
Solomon; this son, Menelik, is the direct ancestor of the dynasties of
Abyssinian monarchs, the present royal house included. Being of David's
seed, the son of Solomon and the Queen of the South, their legendary
ancestor, is regarded by them as kindred to Jesus, who through Joseph,
the carpenter of Nazareth, also traced his ancestry to David.2 Venerating
the Queen of the South, who returned from her visit pregnant with royal
seed, the Ethiopians honor more than any other passage in the Gospels
the words: "He answered and said unto them . . . An evil and adulterous
generation seeketh after a sign. . . . The queen of the south shall rise up
in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came
from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."3
The Abyssinian tradition is put down in writing in Kebra Nagast or The
Book of the Glory of Kings.4 The existing version in Ethiopian is a
translation from an Arabic text, which in turn was translated from the
Coptic. It contains quotations from the Gospels and is therefore a fruit of
the time when Christianity had already found its way to the African
continent, in an early century of the present era.
With colorful imagination Kebra Nagast recounts the bridal night of
Solomon and the Queen of the South; among the presents he gave her
there were "a vessel wherein one could travel over the sea, and a vessel
wherein one could travel by air."
When the queen returned to her country, "her officials who had
remained there brought gifts to their mistress, and made obeisance to
her, and did homage to her, and all the borders of the country rejoiced at
her coming. . . . And she ordered her kingdom aright, and none
disobeyed her command; for she loved wisdom and God strengthened
her kingdom." This quotation from Kebra Nagast resembles the story of
the festival for the officials and for the whole rejoicing land, arranged by
Queen Hatshepsut after her return from her journey; so do the words
that "she ordered her kingdom aright" and that she "loved wisdom." But
there is nothing so extraordinary in these things as to compel the
conclusion that Ethiopian tradition about the Queen of the South knows
more than the Scriptures narrate. Even the romance might have been
borrowed from a Jewish source,5 which in a single line says that the king



responded to the desire of the guest queen. In the Jewish tradition there
is nothing about a child having been born of this intimacy.6
It would, of course, strengthen the claim to originality of the Ethiopian
tradition if it disclosed some fact not contained in the Scriptures, which
could be checked with the help of our knowledge about Queen
Hatshepsut, and which would be more than an accidental coincidence.
Even in this case it would not necessarily mean that - in the words of
Kebra Nagast - Solomon "worked his will with her," and a child of that
union was enthroned in Aksum, "the New Jerusalem"; but it would show
that the Ethiopian legend about the Queen of the South going to
Jerusalem is not entirely a fanciful addition to the scriptural story, like the
legend of Binds, the Queen of Saba of the Arabian authors.
There is a detail in the Ethiopian legend which only by a rare chance
could have been invented. The Ethiopians call the Queen of the South
Makeda. The royal name of Queen Hatshepsut, mentioned throughout
the Punt reliefs, is Make-ra. "Ra" is the divine name of a god.7 The main
part of the name of the Egyptian queen is identical with the first two
syllables in the name of the Queen of the South. It was preserved in the
Ethiopian tradition; it did not come from the Scriptures.
One can imagine that if the name was not handed down by an
uninterrupted tradition it could have been disclosed by some Copt, who
might have lived in early Christian times in Egypt, seen the Punt texts in
Deir el Bahari, and been able to read them, and in this way might have
identified Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba ahead of the present
author. There may have been a chronological reason, too, for such a
hypothetical Copt to identify Hatshepsut with the Queen of the South, or
he might have heard a legend that the reliefs of Deir el Bahari do
represent a voyage to Jerusalem. The same theory could be applied to
Josephus, who might have written "queen of Egypt and Ethiopia" on the
basis of the scenes of the bas-reliefs at Deir el Bahari; he might have
mentioned the kussiim (negroids ) because they were in the picture. This
is a forced construction (Josephus was never in Egypt); on the other
hand, the historical facts known to Josephus and not preserved in the
Scriptures must have been transmitted by some means during the one
thousand years which separated Josephus from Solomon.
Thutmose I, the father of Hatshepsut, conquered the northern part of
Ethiopia known as Nubia. It is of interest that in Egyptian documents the



viceroy of Ethiopia (Nubia) was called "king's son," which is supposed to
be only a title, without implying a blood relationship with the Egyptian
king.8/sup The name of the "king's son" in the time of Hatshepsut is not preserved; in the days
of her successor, Thutmose , the viceroy of Ethiopia was named Nehi.
Another incident in the Ethiopian legend - the robbing of the Temple
in Jerusalem - will be told in the next chapter. The actual. successor to
Hatshepsut on the Egyptian throne was the one who sacked the Temple,
a deed attributed to the putative son of Solomon and the Queen of the
South.
We took a short leave of the historical material to investigate the
Abyssinian legend, and now we should like also to take a look at one or
two Hebrew legends about the Queen of Sheba. Having become
acquainted with the historical person, we are interested to know what
stimulated the folk fantasy and how it worked.
We have already mentioned the divine command heard by Queen
Hatshepsut compelling her to undertake her expedition to the Divine
Land. On the murals, in the coronation scene and in other scenes,
Hatshepsut is portrayed before the god Horus with the head of a hawk;
a serpent of Lower Egypt or a vulture of Upper Egypt, as royal emblems,
are also often pictured with her.9
A curious legend in the Haggadal10 narrates that the Queen of Sheba,
while on her way one morning to pay homage to the god of the sun,
received a message from a bird summoning her to visit Solomon in
Jerusalem.
In the inscriptions Hatshepsut is called king; the pronoun used for her
is sometimes "she" and sometimes "he"; on the pictures her raiment is
that of a king. She is called the daughter of Amon, but in the picture of
her birth a boy is molded by Khnum, the shaper of men. It was unusual,
and contrary to the political and religious conceptions of the Egyptians,
to have a woman ruling on the throne; therefore she disguised herself
and assumed the attributes of a man. On many of her statues and bas
reliefs she is portrayed with a beard. There is a well-known legend that
Solomon, at his first meeting with the Queen of Sheba, said to her about
the hair on her skin (her legs were reflected in a mirrored floor): "Thy
hair is masculine; hair is an ornament to a man, but it disfigures a
woman.11



Rabbi Jonathan in the third century of the present era maintained that
it was a king and not a queen of Sheba who visited Solomon.
Egyptologists of the first half of the nineteenth century pictured and
described Hatshepsut as a king, being misled by some of her statues and
the masculine pronoun she applied to herself.
Could it be that, a few centuries after Hatshepsut, the pictures of Deir
el Bahari, seen by visitors to Egypt, gave rise to these two strange
legends?

2 "They never doubted that Solomon was the father of the son of the Queen of Sheba. It followed
as a matter of course that the male descendants of this son were the lawful kings of Abyssinia, and
as Solomon was an ancestor of Christ they were kinsmen of our Lord, and they claimed to reign
by divine right." Budge, Rebra Nagast, p. x.

purely folklore character, derived from the Old Testament and the later Rabbinic writings, and from
Egyptian (both pagan and Christian), Arabian and Ethiopian sources. Of the early history of the
compilation and its maker, and of its subsequent editors we know nothing, but the principal
groundwork of its earliest form was the traditions that were current in Syria, Palestine, Arabia, and
Egypt during the first four centuries of the Christian era" Kebra Nagast (trans. Budge), pp. XV

Did Hatshepsut Visit the Land of the Queen of Sheba?
The Queen of Sheba who visited King Solomon lived in the tenth
century before this era. It is not known whence she came - from the land
of Saba or from Ethiopia. In the sixteenth century before this era Queen
Hatshepsut undertook an expedition to the Divine Land and Punt. It is
not known where Punt was, but it is thought that it was either in the land
of Saba or on the Somali shore of Ethiopia. Accordingly Queen



Hatshepsut might have visited the land of the Queen of Sheba six
centuries before this queen made her voyage to Jerusalem.
As the "marvels" brought by Hatshepsut from Punt are not unlike the
"marvels" brought by Hiram and Solomon from Ophir, a few authors
have ventured to identify Punt and Ophir, though the whereabouts of the
latter place has not yet been established. According to that theory, the
Phoenician king Hiram undertook a voyage of discovery to Punt, visited
by Hatshepsut centuries earlier.1
The reconstruction of history offered here, reducing the age of the
New Kingdom of Egypt by almost six centuries, places Queen
Hatshepsut in the tenth instead of the sixteenth century and makes her a
contemporary of Solomon. Consequently, I have argued: It is said about
Solomon that his fame spread to faraway countries, and all kings sought
his presence; the same is told of Queen Hatshepsut; if they were
contemporaries, it is strange that they should not have come in contact
with each other.
To prove that the Queen of Sheba and Queen Hatshepsut were one
and the same person, I had to show that the Queen of Sheba came from
Egypt and that Queen Hatshepsut visited Palestine. Regarding the
former, there is a definite statement by Josephus that the queen came
from Egypt. This statement has been unduly neglected. Fortunately we
also have an illustrated diary of Queen Hatshepsut, which gives an
account of an expedition to a foreign country. That she participated in
the expedition is not difficult to establish by explicit statements, in which
she calls herself the leader of the expedition.
I also had to show that Punt and the Divine Land are Phoenicia and
Palestine. Repeated references to Punt as a country east of Egypt
exclude Somaliland. The return of the ships of the expedition to the Nile
harbor of Thebes excludes southern Arabia and Somaliland and places
Punt on the shore of the Mediterranean.
I then compared the scriptural record of the Visit of the Queen of
Sheba and the Egyptian account of the expedition to the Divine Land
and found complete accord.
The journey of the "remarkable woman who ruled Egypt," who came
"with a great company" into the Divine Land; "her astonishment at what
she saw" and what excelled "the hearsay"; "the terraces of trees" she
wondered at, the gifts she exchanged, among them the marvels brought



by Hiram from Ophir, the apes and other animals, silver, rare until that
time, ebony, ivory and precious stones, incense and myrrh "without
number," and trees "never seen before" - all this is found alike in the
scriptural version of that voyage, in Josephus' story, and in the
inscriptions and pictures of the Egyptian temple built by the queen after
her return to Thebes. This temple impressed the scholars by its foreign
architecture, and the queen herself emphasized that it was an imitation
of what she had seen in Punt. New forms of services were introduced,
with twelve priests and a high priest officiating.
The complete agreement in the details of the voyage and in many
accompanying data makes it evident that the Queen {of] Sheba and
Queen Hatshepsut were one and the same person2 Punt was Palestine
Phoenicia, and the Divine Land or Holy Land, the Holy Land of
Jerusalem. The people of the "Caucasian" or "north-Semitic race" were
the Jews. The chief Paruah who met the expedition of Hatshepsut in the
harbor was the governor of Solomon in Ezion. Geber. The apes and
other exotic animals, which led the historians to the conclusion that Punt
was in Africa, were actually brought to Jerusalem on the ships of
Solomon and Hiram. The exotic plants were also brought from afar.
There remains to be explained the provenance of one plant exported
from Punt. Long before the expedition of Queen Hatshepsut and for
some time thereafter, Punt and Divine Land were repeatedly mentioned
in Egyptian documents as places producing frankincense. Because of the
frankincense, Punt was thought to be in southern Arabia. I leave it for
the next chapter to show that frankincense grew in Palestine.

(Munich, 1895); Eng. trans., King Solomo's Golden Ophir (New York, 1899).
2 Shwa (the Hebrew for Sheba) might be the last part of the name Hatshepsut. R. Engelbach, The
Problem of the Obelisks (London, 1928), spells her name Hatshepsut. The final t in her name was
not pronounced. Naville (Deis el Bahari) spells it Hatshepsut. It was usual to shorten the Egyptian
names: so Amenhotep was often shortened to Hui.



Chapter IV
THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM
Thutmose Prepares the Disintegration of the Empire of Solomon
DURING the last period of her reign Queen Hatshepsut made Thutmose
co-ruler with her on the throne. At first he played a subordinate role: his
name was written after hers; in pictures his figure was placed behind
hers. The bas-reliefs of the Punt expedition show the young prince as a
small figure in the background, bringing an offering of incense to the
bark of Amon-Ra. Later, when he reigned alone, Thutmose became the
greatest of all the conquerors who sat on the throne of the New Kingdom
in Egypt.
His military expeditions were directed into Palestine and Syria. He
subdued these countries; some of the cities were vanquished by force;
others bowed before him, opened their gates, and became tributaries.
The records of his military successes, cut in hieroglyphics on the walls
of the great Amon temple in Karnak, recount his campaigns in Palestine
and Syria. A list of one hundred and nineteen cities in Palestine is
engraved three times on the walls of that temple. Each city is represented
by a man with his arms bound behind him, and a shield covering the
body of the man bears the name of the city he symbolizes. Another list,
imperfect and in one copy, shows almost three hundred Syrian cities as
captives, also as men bound and with shields on their breasts.
A bas-relief at Karnak shows the treasures in gold, silver, bronze, and
precious stones that Thutmose brought as booty from one of his
campaigns; a series of other murals exhibits the flora and fauna he
transported from Palestine to Egypt.
These campaigns are unanimously considered to have been waged in
a Canaan which had not yet heard of the Israelite tribes. The places
named in the list of cities are regarded as settlements of the Canaanites;
the booty taken in the conquest contains examples of the art that



flourished in Canaan long before the Israelites, led by Joshua, came to
that land. Their exodus and their entry into Canaan were still far in the
future when Thutmose conquered Canaan. and Syria. It is also
sometimes said that if the Israelites in his day had already become
organized into a tribal sept they were still obscure nomads in the
highlands between the Euphrates and the Nile.
Thutmose III , the conqueror of Palestine, was the heir of Hat
Hatsheput; according to the chronological scheme advanced here, he
reigned in the later years of Solomon and at the time of Solomon's son
and successor, Rehoboam. If the reconstruction of history undertaken in
this work is correct, Thutmose's victorious march through Palestine must
have taken place in the years closely following the reign of Solomon, and
a record of it should be preserved in the Scriptures. The conquest by
Thutmose was a triumphant sweep across Palestine, and the chronicles
of Judah and Israel could not possibly have omitted it; indeed, a
conspicuous record of it must be there.
Once more this reconstruction is put to the test. The absence of a
scriptural record of the conquest of Palestine by an invading Egyptian
army under the personal leadership of a pharaoh, in the years following
the reign of Solomon, would be regarded as irrefutable evidence against
it.
But this record is preserved in the Scriptures, and it coincides
completely with the Karnak inscriptions.
Two monarchies rose from the ruins of the Amalekite Empire: Israel
and Egypt. Israel, the vanquisher of Amalek, got a large share; his legacy
ran from the Euphrates to Egypt, embracing the kingdoms of Syria,
Canaan, and Edom, deep into the Arabian peninsula; tribute came to
Israel from north, east, and south, and his land dominated the trade
between Asia and Africa and the terminals of two great sea routes, the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea.
Egypt, the ancient house of bondage, was freed from the Hyksos
tyranny by the Israelites under Saul. But Egypt rewarded good with evil.
The tales of the splendor of Jerusalem, enriched by conquest and trade,
inspired Hatshepsut with the desire to behold its wealth herself.
Thutmose , as a young prince, either participated in this expedition into
"God's Land" or heard from Hatshepsut about the luxurious land of



delight"; and he saw the gifts which were said to be marvels. The bas
reliefs of the Punt expedition were bound to keep those experiences fresh
in his mind. His eye looked with envy on that land and on the wealth
accumulated there.
Solomon, whose name is a synonym for a wise, even the wisest, man,
must be charged with most grievous political errors. In the latter part of
his reign the builder of the Temple in Jerusalem became a worshiper of
strange gods and a builder of high places to them. It is said that he built
on the hills around Jerusalem sanctuaries to foreign deities because of
the strange women he loved: ". . . his wives turned away his heart" ( I
Kings 11:4).
Solomon planned, through his marriages with the daughter of
Pharaoh and with the "women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
Zidonians, and Hittites," to build a cosmopolitan center at Jerusalem. In
erecting shrines to strange gods, he thought that Jerusalem, as the abode
of the deities of foreign nations, would demonstrate his tolerance and
that Jerusalem would become the gathering place for various religions
and cults.
Since the Egyptian princess is mentioned as the first among the wives
of Solomon, the statue of Amon-Ra, the official supreme god of Egypt,
should have been among the gods of all of Solomon's "strange wives" (I
Kings 11:5-8).
Among the murals of the Punt expedition, one, defaced by a chisel,
contained an inscription, and from the few words which remain it can be
understood that a statue, obviously of the god Amon-Ra, was erected in
the Divine Land.1 The statues of pagan gods were destroyed by later
kings of the House of David2 and cannot be found in Jerusalem; but the
text of the eleventh chapter of the First Book of Kings, just following the
story of the Queen of Sheba, helps to cast light on the damaged
inscription.
Jerusalem, with its foreign deities and cults, did not become a political
center for strange peoples, but it rapidly became the goal of their political
aspirations. Already in the oracle scene of the Punt expedition it is said
in the name of the god Amon-Ra: "It is a glorious region of God's
Land, it is indeed my place of delight. I have made it for myself. . . . I
know [them], I am their wise lord, I am the begetter Amon-Ra."



This was written in the days of the peaceful Hatshepsut. The
conversion of Jerusalem into a holy city for all nations doomed its
national independence.
The dismembering of the state was provoked by Solomon's policy. In
the days of Saul and David the state attained independence. The heyday
of imperialistic power was very short, political ascendancy reaching its
culmination in the reign of Solomon; at the end of his reign the rapid
decline started.
Three adversaries rose against Solomon, and they began to rend his
realm apart. The first of these was Hadad the Edomite.3 In the time of
David, Hadad, then still a child, fled from Edom into Egypt and later
married into the pharaoh's family. On David's death he returned to his
country. When Solomon built the harbor of Ezion-Geber the Edomite
land was temporarily pacified. Hadad, Solomon's adversary in Edom,
succeeded in stirring up this region into a state of unrest. Related to the
house of Pharaoh and coming from Egypt, Hadad obviously was
supported by the bearer of the double crown of Egypt.
Another adversary, Rezon, who fled from his lord Hadadezer, king of
Zobah, became captain of a band and ruled in Damascus.
Thus, these two legacies of the Amalekite Empire, Arabia and Syria,
turned away from the House of David. Even the land of the Twelve
Tribes was divided when Solomon closed his eyes.
Solomon's third adversary, Jeroboam the Ephraimite, Solomon's
subject and servant, whom he made "ruler over all the charge of the
house of Joseph," secretly harbored the ambitious intention of making
the land of Ephraim independent. Solomon, becoming aware of the
germs of conspiracy in time, sought to kill Jeroboam.
I KINGS 11:40 . . . And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt,
and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.4,
When Solomon died, leaving the throne to his son Rehoboam, the
conspirators, backed by the Egyptian king, were ready to act.
I KINGS 12:3-4 . . . they [his adherents] sent and called him [Jeroboam to return from
Egypt]. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam,
saying:
Thy father made our yoke grievous. . . .



The negotiations ended with the proclamation: "What portion have we
in David? . . . to your tents, 0 Israel. . . . So Israel departed unto their
tents." But the cities of Judah and Benjamin remained faithful to
Rehoboam.
Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of collecting the taxes,
and "all Israel stoned him with stones" (I Kings 12:18). "So Israel rebelled
against the house of David" (I Kings 12:19). Rehoboam gathered the
warriors of Judah and Benjamin to fight against Israel, but the prophet
Shemaiah called every man to return to his house and not to fight
against his brethren (II Chronicles 11:2-4).
Jeroboam girded Shechem in Mount Ephraim, and Penuel; to keep
the people from going to Jerusalem to sacrifice, he set up images of
foreign deities in Beth-el and in Dan (I Kings 12:28-29), two old
sanctuaries of Israel, holy long before Jerusalem was conquered by
David.



Plate VI: THUTMOSE III






In the northern kingdom Jeroboam introduced as the official cult the
worship of bullocks, which may have had something in common with
the Egyptian cult of the bull Apis. He received political power from the
mighty pharaoh, for he had to rend Israel from Judah. From the very
outset he was a political and cultural vassal of Egypt. The prophet
Shemaiah could hear the steps of Jeroboam's master behind him.
Fighting between Judah and Israel accorded completely with the plan of
Thutmose III
The annals of Thutmose III, after giving the date of the first victorious
expedition to extend the boundaries of Egypt, record:
ANNALS OF KARNAK; Now at that time the Asiatics had fallen into disagreement each man
fighting against his neighbour.1
A victory over a foe weakened by internal discord is a diluted triumph.
Why, then, do the annals mention this discord in the land of the
Pharoah's foes? It was the work of Thutmose III himself to prepare the
disunity by setting one part of the population against the other; hence
this record does not detract from his right to laurels. 2
Rehoboam felt the danger. He rushed to wall the cities, and to those
fortified in the time of his father Solomon and his grandfather David he
added Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth-Zur, Socoh, Adullam, Gath and
Mareshah, and other strongholds. 1
Four years had elapsed since Solomon died, and the pharoah already
was on the move northwards.
1 K. Sethe, who directed attention to this text and to the very surprising fact that a statue for
worship was erected in Punt, expressed his hope that the possible future discovery of an Egyptian
statue would he to determine the location of Punt. ("Eine bisher unbeachtet gebliebene Episode

Thutmose III invades Palestine



Thutmose III advanced to the estuary at the eastern mouth of the Nile;
in nine days he marched across the triangular peninsula to Gaza,
proceeding along the old military road.2 On the lowland of the coast he
held a consultation with his army and decided to go through the narrow
pass to Megiddo (Mykty). Megiddo was one of the principal regional
cities of Solomon (I Kings 4:12), mentioned together with Taanach as the
seat of a governor. It was a stronghold closing the passage from the
south of Carmel into the valley of Jezreel. Ordering the consultation with
his army, Thutmose said as follows:
That wretched enemy [the chief] of Kadesh has come and entered into Megiddo; he is there at
this moment.2
Who was the chief (king) of Kadesh who came to defend this fortified
point? He is not called by name. And where was this Kadesh? The
events of the next few days will be followed, and then these questions
will again be asked.
The southern wing of the Egyptian army was in Taanach; the army
passed Aruna and came to the bank of the brook of Kina.
"Prepare your weapons! for we shall advance to fight with that wretched foe in the morning!"
The king rested in the royal tent . . . the watch of the army went about saying,
"Steady of heart! steady of heart! Watchful! Watchful!"
. . . Early in the morning, behold, command was given to the entire army to move.3
The king went forth in a chariot of electrum (gold in amalgam with
silver) in the center of his army, one wing being at the brook of Kina, the
other northwest of Megiddo. The Egyptian army prevailed:
. . . When they saw his majesty prevailing against them they fled headlong to Megiddo, in fear,
abandoning their horses and their chariots of gold and silver.
. . . Now, if only the army of his majesty had not given their heart to plundering the things of
the enemy, they would have [captured] Megiddo [Mykty] at this moment, when the wretched
foe of Kadesh [Kds] and the wretched foe of this city were hauled up in haste to bring them
into this city. The fear of his majesty had entered their hearts.4
The above explanation is given to excuse the escape of the king of
Kadesh, who was not taken prisoner.
The victorious army of his majesty went around counting their portions. . . . The whole army
made jubilee.5



The siege of Megiddo began. Although the city was fortified by a
heavy wall, the garrison was unable to stand a long siege against the
army of the pharaoh, and surrendered. "Behold, the chiefs of this
country came to render their portions."
The Egyptian army took three other cities. In the annals the
description of the end of the campaign has not been preserved, but it
may be reconstructed. The results of this first campaign were the
conquest of the walled cities as recorded in the quoted annals; the
submission of the entire land of one hundred and nineteen cities with the
city of Kadesh first on the list, as appears on the "cities bas-relief" in the
Karnak temple; rich spoils of precious vessels shown on a mural also in
Karnak.
The most important questions have remained unsolved. Where was
the city of Kadesh? Who the king of the city of Kadesh was is not even
asked.
How to find the name of a king of an unlocated city, who lived
hundreds of years before Joshua, if the Egyptian record does not
mention it?
The second question puzzling investigators is how the name of
Jerusalem or Salem or Jebus, as it was called before, came to be omitted
from a most complete list of the cities of Palestine, a list comprising, it
would seem, all the towns of importance in pre-Israelite Palestine.
The third puzzle is the exquisite form of the vessels captured in this
campaign, showing a very high degree of craftsmanship; it is surprising
to find that the uncultured peoples of the Canaanite era were artisans of
such excellent skill.
In view of the documentary inscriptions and carvings of Karnak, it is
thought that the Canaanites were superior artists in metalwork, and that
Jerusalem escaped the doom of its neighbor cities; but the location of
Kadesh remained a matter for scientific debate.
The king of Kadesh came to Megiddo to defend it against the king of
Egypt; the stronghold fell; he succeeded in escaping; but in the same
campaign his own city was subjugated too.

Kadesh in Judah
The historians claim to know one famous Kadesh, located by them on
the Orontes River in northern Syria. But in the list of Thutmose the city
of Kadesh is named as the first among one hundred and nineteen
Palestinian (not Syrian) cities; in second place is Megiddo, the scene of
the battle; and one hundred and seventeen other cities follow them. This
Kadesh could not be a city in Syria, for in the Palestine campaign
Thutmose did not reach the Orontes. There was a Kadesh in Galilee,
Kadesh Naphtali, mentioned a few times in the Scriptures; but what
would be the purpose of placing this unimportant city at the top of the
list just before Megiddo? It became a matter for conjecture.
According to one hypothesis, the city referred to was Kadesh
Naphtali;1 according to another, Kadesh on the Orontes;2 and each
theory had to be supported by some explanation as to why a city outside
Palestine or an insignificant city in Palestine was placed at the head of a
list of Palestinian cities where one would expect to find the capital of the
land.
The suggestion was advanced that the first name on the Palestine list
did not belong to the register and had been added later.3 This is highly
improbable, especially since the interpolation (if it be such) was made on
all three copies. Or, it was said, the Galilean city might have been
intended, but the sculptor mistook it for the famous Kadesh on the
Orontes and for this erroneous reason put it in first place.4
These theories met opposition. The Palestinian lists were executed
shortly after the return from the Palestinian campaign and prior to the
Syrian campaign; at that time there was no reason to confuse the cities;5
beyond doubt the list was executed with the personal knowledge of
Thutmose and was checked by his officials.
The coeval history of Judah, short yet clear, records:
II CHRONICLES 12:2-4 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam,
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. . . .
With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were
without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim [Libyans], the Suldciim, and the



Ethiopians.
And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
The conquest of the walled cities is the phase of the war related in the
beginning of the annals of Thutmose which have been preserved. The
second phase is the move on the capital.
Jerusalem, against which the pharaoh advanced, must have been the
city of Kadesh. This one answer serves two questions: Why was
Jerusalem not on the list of Thutmose , and Where was the king-city of
Kadesh?
Is Jerusalem anywhere else called Kadesh? In many places all through
the Scriptures. "Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the
city of David . . . because the places are kadesh [holy]."6 In the Psalms
the Lord says: "Yet have I set my king upon Zion, my mount kadesh."7
Joel called on the people: "Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an
alarm in my mountain kadesh." 8 He also said: "So shall ye know that I
am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion, my kadesh [holy] mountain:
then shall Jerusalem be [really] holy [kadesh]."9 Isaiah said of the people
of Jerusalem: ". . . for they call themselves of the city Kadesh." He
prophesied about the day when the Lord "will gather all nations and
tongues. . . . And they shall bring all your brethrens . . . out of all nations
. . . to my kadesh mountain Jerusalem."10 Daniel prayed: ". . . let thine
anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy kadesh
mountain,"11 "thy city kaclesh."12 And Nehemiah wrote: ". . . the rest of
the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the
city kadesh."13






The "Holy Land" and the "Holy City" are names given to Palestine and
Jerusalem in early times, as not only the Scriptures but also the Egyptian
inscriptions ("God's Land," "Kadesh") bear witness.
The name Kadesh is used for Jerusalem not in Hebrew texts alone.
The names of the most obscure Arab villages in Palestine were
scrutinized by the scholars in biblical lore in an endeavor to locate the
ancient cities, but the Arab name for Jerusalem was overlooked: it is el
Kuds (the Holy, or the Holiness).
Kadesh, the first among the Palestinian cities, was Jerusalem. The
"wretched foe," the king of Kadesh, was Rehoboam. Among the one
hundred and nineteen cities were many which the scholars did not dare
to recognize: they were built when Israel was already settled in Canaan.
Antiquity was ascribed to other cities which were not entitled to it.
The walled cities fortified by Rehoboam (II Chronicles 11:5ff.) may be
found in the Egyptian list.14 It appears that Etam is Itmm; Beth-Zur - Bt
sir; Socoh - Sk.15 Here is a new field for scholarly inquiry: the
examination of the list of the Palestinian cities of Thutmose III,
comparing their names with the names of the cities in the kingdom of
Judah. The work will be fruitful.
At the end of the preceding section we left Thutmose under the walls
of Kadesh-Jerusalem. The strongholds of the land westward from
Jerusalem had fallen; the strongest of them, defended by the king of
Jerusalem, opened its gates after the king and his escort had escaped
and returned to Jerusalem.
II CHRONICLES 12:5 . . . the princes of Judah . . . were gathered together to Jerusalem
because of Shishak.
The land only a few years before had been rent in two. Judah,
weakened by the separation of the northern kingdom, was unable to
defend itself.
The prophet Shemaiah, who, four years earlier, had warned the
people against engaging in a fraternal war, came to the king and to the
princes of Judah with a wrathful message from the Lord, forsaken by the
people of Jerusalem. The king and the princes abased themselves, and
the king said: "The Lord is righteous." Then
Shemaiah came with another message:



II CHRONICLES 12:7f. . . . I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be
poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. Nevertheless they shall be his servants.
Because they did not wish to be the servants of the Lord, they would
be servants of an earthly kingdom. This was said in the name of the
Lord. And the Egyptian king and his army, who at Megiddo "gave praise
to Amon for the victory he granted to his son," certainly repeated their
praise at the walls of Jerusalem.
After the fall of "the fenced cities which pertained to Judah," Jerusalem
opened its gates without offering resistance. "Whereupon the princes of
Israel and the king humbled themselves," and they were "not destroyed,"
and the Lord's wrath was "not poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand
of Shishak." The city was not stormed.
There is no record of any storming of Kadesh by Thutmose. But
Kadesh in Palestine fell to Thutmose and its name heads the list of
Palestinian cities captured by him. The humbling of the princes of Judah
after the fall of Megiddo is described also by Thutmose in these words:
Behold, the chiefs of this country came to render their portions, to do obeisance to the fame
of his majesty, to crave breath for their nostrils, because of the greatness of his power, because
of the might of the fame of his majesty.16
"The greatness of his power" is also mentioned in the Hebrew version
"the twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horse-men, and the
people without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the
Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians."
The indignant Lord humiliated Jerusalem, which erected statues of
Egyptian, Sidonian, and other deities on the hills around Jerusalem;
soon the god with the head of a ram would receive all the splendor from
Solomon's Temple, every removable precious thing.
II CHRONICLES 12:9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away
the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he
carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
There remained the old Ark of the Covenant, a worthless piece, a relic
of the desert, together with the stones of the Commandments. Was
Egypt poor in old steles?

The Vessels and Furniture of Solomon's Temple
The treasures brought by Thutmose from Palestine are re-produced on
a wall of the Karnak temple.
The bas-relief displays in ten rows the legendary wealth of Solomon.
There are pictures of various precious objects, furnishings, vessels, and
utensils of the Temple, of the palace, probably also of the shrines to
foreign deities. Under each object a numerical symbol indicates how
many of that kind were brought by the Egyptian king from Palestine:
each stroke means one piece, each arch means ten pieces, each spiral
one hundred pieces of the same thing. If Thutmose had wanted to boast
and to display all his spoils from the Temple and the Palace of Jerusalem
by showing each object separately instead of using this number system, a
wall a mile long would have been required and even that would not
have sufficed. In the upper five rows the objects of gold are presented; in



the next rows silver things are mingled with those of gold and precious
stones; objects of bronze and semiprecious stones are in the lower rows.
Wealth accumulated by a nation during hundreds of years of
industrious work and settled life in Palestine, spoils gathered by Saul and
David in their military expeditions, loot of the Amalekite Auaris, earnings
from the trade between Asia and Africa, gold from Ophir, the gifts of the
queen Sheba-Hatshepsut, all became the booty of Thutmose . The work
of Huram, of the tribe of Naphtali, is reproduced on the walls of the
Karnak temple; Huram and his workmen were skilled artisans, and the
hand of their royal master, Solomon, supplied them lavishly with
precious metal and stone.1 Specimens of the skill of David's craftsmen
must also be found in this exhibit, for
I KINGS 7:51 . . . Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even
the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the
Lord.
The sacred objects wrought by the ancient master Bezaleel, son of
Uri,2 may also have been reproduced here.
An exhaustive indentification of objects pictured in the Karnak temple
and of those described in the Books of Kings and Chronicles is a matter
for prolonged study and should preferably be done with the help of
molds from the bas-reliefs at Karnak. The following short excursus is not
intended to be complete and definitive; it is only tentative. Yet it will
demonstrate the identity of the booty of Thutmose with that carried out
of Jerusalem by the Egyptian king in the days of Rehoboam, son of
Solomon./p
A large part of the booty of Thutmose consisted of religious objects
taken from a temple. There were altars for burnt offerings and incense,
tables for the sacrifice, lavers for liquid offerings, vessels for sacred oil,
tables for showbread, and the like in great quantity. No doubt it was an
extremely rich temple that was pillaged by Thutmose III.
The objects taken by Shishak from Jerusalem were the treasures of the
Temple of Solomon and of the king's palace (II Chronicles 12:9).
On the Karnak bas-relief Thutmose is shown presenting certain objects
to the god Amon: these objects are the part of the king's booty which he
dedicated to the temple of Amon and gave to the Egyptian priests. This
picture does not represent the whole booty of Thutmose III. He chose for



the Egyptian temples what he took from the foreign Temple, and in this
collection of "cunning work" one has to look for the objects enumerated
in the sections of the Books of Kings and of Chronicles describing the
Temple.
On the walls of the tomb chambers of Thutmose's viziers treasures are
shown in the process of transportation from Palestine. Besides the art
work familiar from the scene of presentation to Amon, there are also
other objects, apparently from the palace. These were delivered to
Pharaoh's palace and to the houses of his favorites.
The books of the Scriptures have preserved a detailed record of
furniture and vessels of the Temple only. Fortunately the separation of
the sacral booty in the scene of dedication to Amon makes the task of
recognition easier.
The metals used and the style of the craftsmanship will be compared
briefly in the Hebrew and Egyptian sources. The material of which the
objects were made is indicated by accompanying inscriptions on the bas
relief; they were made of three different metals, translated as gold, silver,
and bronze. The metals used for the sacral furniture and for the vessels
in the Temple of Solomon were of gold, silver, and bronze ("brass"). The
"turning work" was manufactured of each of these metals.
Often an article is represented on the wall in gold and another of the
same shape in brass. The fashioning of identical objects in gold as well
as in bronze (brass) for the Temple of Solomon is repeatedly referred to
in the Books of Kings and of Chronicles.
When gold was used for the vessels and the furnishings of Solomon's
Temple, it was either solid gold3 or a hammered gold overlay on wood.4
The pictures of the objects in Karnak are described by the words "gold"
and "overlaid with gold."
In the period when Israel had no permanent site for its place of
worship, the Ark of the Covenant and other holy objects were moved
from one place to another and were sometimes taken into battle. In
order to facilitate transportation, the furnishings of the tabernacle were
made with rings and bars.5 The old furniture of the tabernacle was
placed in the Temple by Solomon,6 and was carried off, in the days of
his son, by the pharaoh and his army. The Ark of the Covenant,
however, was not removed but remained in the Temple until the



Babylonian exile.7 It was probably a model for other transportable
sacred paraphernalia used in the holy enclosure in Beth-el and in Shiloh
and thereafter in Jerusalem. In the second and seventh rows of the
Karnak bas-relief are shown various ark-shaped chests with rings at the
corners and bars for transportation.
"A crown of gold round about" was an ancient Judean ornament of
sacred tables and altars.8 Such ornamentation is seen on the golden altar
in the second row (9) of the mural, as well as on the bronze (brass) altar
in the ninth row (177 ).9
The preferred ornament on the vessels was the shoshana, translated as
"lily" (lotus).
I KINGS 7:26 . . . the brim thereof [of the molten sea] was wrought like the brim of a cup,
with Rowers of lilies.
The lotus motif is often repeated on the vessels reproduced on the wall
of Karnak. A lotus vial is shown in gold (10 ), in silver (121), and in
colored stone (malachite?) (140). A rim of lily work may be seen on
various vessels (35, 75, 175), a very unusual type of rim ornament,
found only in the scriptural account and on the bas-reliefs of Thutmose
III.
Buds among flowers ("his knops and his flowers"10 ) were also used as
ornamentation in the tabernacle. This motif appears on a vase (195) in
the lower row of the Karnak mural and also in the fifth row (75).
Of animal figures, lions and oxen are mentioned as decorative motifs
of the Temple in Jerusalem (I Kings 7:29 and 36). The Karnak mural
shows lion heads (20, 60), and the head of an ox is recognizable as an
ornament on a drinking vessel (132).
Gods were often depicted in Egyptian temples in shameless positions.
Among the figures of sacred objects on the Karnak bas-relief there are
none of phallic form, neither are there any pictures of gods at all. A few
animal heads (lions) with the sign of the uraeus on their foreheads and
the head of a hawk are wrought on the lids of some cups. These cups
might have been brought from the palace Solomon had built for his
Egyptian wife.
Idols were and still are used in all pagan worship. The hundreds of
sacred objects appearing in the mural were obviously not of an



idolatrous cult; they suggest, rather, a cult in which offerings of animals,
incense, and showbread were brought, but in which no idols were
worshiped. The Temple of Kadesh-Jerusalem, sacked by Thutmose , was
rich in utensils for religious services but devoid of any image of a god.
Piece by piece the altars and vessels of Solomon's Temple can be
identified on the wall of Karnak.
In the Temple of Solomon there was an altar of gold for burnt offerings
(I Kings 7:48; II Chronicles 4:19). It was the only such altar. In the
second row of the bas-reliefs is an altar with a crown around the edge,
partly destroyed, but partly plainly discernible (9). The inscription reads:
"The [a] great altar." It was made of gold.
Another altar in the Temple of Jerusalem was of "brass" (bronze ); it
was square and very large.11 In the ninth row of the Karnak relief an
altar of "brass" (bronze) is pictured, the shape of which is similar to that
of the gold altar. The inscription says (177): "One great altar of brass
[bronze]." Inasmuch as its height is equal to its width, the altar does not
fit the description of the altar mentioned in the Second Book of
Chronicles, which was half as high as it was wide. However, from the
first chapter of the Second Book of Chronicles we know that another
brazen altar made by Bezaleel was among the holy objects of the Temple
at Jerusalem.
Next to the altar was the table "whereupon the shewbread was" (I
Kings 7:48; II Chronicles 4:19). The showbread was obviously not of
flour, but of silver or gold; in the Book of Exodus12 it is said that
showbread was made by Bezaleel, who was a goldsmith. Show-bread is
pictured on the bas-relief of Karnak in the form of a cone. The cone in
the seventh row (138) bears the explanation: "White bread." This bread
was of silver. The thirty cones of gold (48) and the twenty-four cones of
colored stone (malachite) (169), identical in form with the silver cone,
also represent showbread.
The "candlestick with the lamps" (II Chronicles 4:20) was an
illuminating device with lamps shaped like flowers. Figures 35, 36, 37,
and 38 of the mural are candlesticks with lamps. One of them (35) has
three lily lamps on the left and three on the right. The other candlesticks
(37, 38) have eight lamps to the left and eight to the right. The
candlestick with lamps wrought by Bezaleel for the tabernacle had three



lamps to the left and three to the right.'13 There were almonds, a knop,
and a flower on the arms. A later form showed a preference for seven
lamps on both sides of the stem.
Other candlesticks are mentioned in addition to those with lamps. In
the Book of Kings they are described as bearing flowers (I Kings 7:49).
This form is seen in the third row of the bas-relief (25, 26, 27, and 28).
The candlestick is in the shape of a stem with a lotus blossom.
Next to the altar, the tables with the showbread, and the candlesticks
were the tables for offerings.
EXODUS 35:13 The table . . . and all his vessels.
37:16 . . . vessels . . . upon the table: his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers
to cover withal, of pure gold.






PLATE VIII: VESSELS AND FURNISHINGS OF THE TEMPLE AT
JERUSALEM






The table, like its vessels, was of gold (I Kings 7:48). "The tables of
sacrifice" in the third row (of gold) and in the seventh row (of silver) of
the mural have sets of vessels on them: three flat dishes, three large cups,
three pots ( or bowls ), one shovel. Many tables of gold and silver and
bronze are reproduced on the bas-relief. The paraphernalia of the
Temple contained also "hooks and all instruments" (II Chronicles 4:16).
In the third row of the Karnak mural, near the table of offerings, and in
the same row at the left end, there are hooks, spoons, and other
implements (30, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44); bowls appear in most of the rows,
but especially in the second and sixth ( of gold).
"The incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil" were in the
Temple of Jerusalem (Exodus 35:15). As no detailed description of the
form of this altar is given in the Scriptures, various objects in the form of
altars suitable for incense may be considered. Did the smoke of the
burning incense pour through the openings in the ornamental spouts?
Was the incense burned in a dish set on a base (41, 181)? Vessels
containing anointing oil are shown on pedestal altars (41); over the
figures in the lower row (197-99) is written: "Alabaster, filled with holy
anointing oil for the sacrifice."
Golden snuffers were used in the Temple of Solomon for spreading the
fragrance during the service (II Chronicles 4:22; I Kings 7:50). Masrek in
Hebrew means a fountain or a vessel that ejects a fluid. Such fountains
are mentioned as having been in the Temple of Solomon (I Kings 7:50; II
Chronicles 4:22). Among the vessels shown on the wall at Karnak there
are one or two whose form is peculiar. The vessel in the fifth row (73)
has two side spouts and is adorned with figures of animals. The spouts
are connected with the basin by two animals (lions?) stretching toward
them; rodents run along the spouts, one pair up and one pair down;
amphibians (frogs) sit on top of the vessel. It is not unusual to decorate
modern fountains in a like manner. The figures of frogs are especially
appropriate for this purpose. The tubes and the mouths of the animals
on the vessel could be used to spout perfume or water. The neighboring
object seems also to be a fountain.
One hundred basins of gold were made by Solomon for the Temple (II
Chronicles 4:8). Ninety-five basins of gold are shown in the sixth row of
the mural; six larger basins are shown apart.



The walls and floor of Solomon's Temple were "overlaid with fine gold"
and "garnished with precious stones" (II Chronicles 3:5-6; I Kings
6:28ff.). Pharaoh, who "took all," did not leave this gold or these stones
on the walls. Some of them were worked into jewels, and the inscription
(over 63-65) reads: "Gold and various precious stones his majesty had
reworked." Other gold was taken in the form of bricks and links (chains)
(23, 24 ). Chains of gold are also mentioned as having been in the
Temple of Solomon (II Chronicles 3:16): "And he made chains."
Thirty-three doors are represented in the lower row of the bas-relief
and the inscription says they are "of beaten copper" (190).
II CHRONICLES 4:9 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and
doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with copper.14
Targets or shields of "beaten gold" are named among the booty of the
pharaoh (II Chronicles 9:15). These three hundred shields, together with
the two hundred targets of gold (II Chronicles 9:15, 16), were not part of
the furnishings of the Temple; they adorned "the house of the forest of
Lebanon." In the seventh row of the mural there are three disks marked
with the number 300, which means that they represent three hundred
pieces. The metal of which they are made is not mentioned; some
objects in this row are of silver, but the next figure has a legend
indicating that it is of gold.
The large "sea of brass" and the brazen bases (I Kings 7:23; II
Chronicles 4:2) were not removed by the pharaoh (II Kings 25:16).
Among the things which were taken later by Nebuzaradan, the captain of
Nebuchadnezzar, were "two pillars, one sea, and the bases which
Solomon had made for the House of the Lord."15
The ephod of the high priest (a collar with a breastplate) was not
mentioned in the Scriptures among the booty of the pharaoh and might
not have been taken. But precious garments of the priests were carried
off. The fourth row displays rich collars, some with breastplates; they
were destined to be gifts for the priests of Amon.
In the bas-reliefs of Karnak we have a very excellent and detailed
account of the vessels and furniture of the Temple of Solomon, much
more detailed than the single bas-relief of the Titus Arch in Rome,
showing the candlestick and a few other vessels of the Second Temple,



brought to the Roman capital just one thousand years after the sack of
the First Temple by the Egyptians.

Kings 24:13). But in Seder Olam it is said that Pharaoh Zerah returned to Asa what Shishak had
taken from Rehoboam.
Zoological and Botanical Collections from Palestine
Thutmose succeeded in his plans. The kingdom of David and
Solomon was divided; Judah bowed to Egyptian domination. The naval
base at Ezion-Geber was no longer controlled by Judah. The maritime
expeditions of the Israelites in company with the sailors of Tyre and
Sidon were not repeated.
Megiddo, which guarded the road between Jerusalem and Sidon,
became the chief Egyptian stronghold in Syria-Palestine. The Sidonians,
who helped the garrison of Megiddo, probably as mercenaries, tried after
its fall to save their own independence. Jaffa fell to a general of
Thutmose III;1 the fleet of the Phoenicians, or part of it, was seized by



Thutmose a few years later. The northern realm of Israel, ruled by a
puppet Icing, a tool in the hands of the pharaoh, did not need to be
conquered. Jeroboam came from Egypt, where he was trained for his
task. It is only logical, therefore, to expect that the land of Israel would
voluntarily pay tribute to Thutmose III
In less than five months - in one hundred and forty-eight days, to be
exact - the Palestine campaign was over. The next year Thutmose III
returned to Palestine on an inspection tour and received tribute. In
Palestine the pharaoh took a daughter of the royal family to be one of
his wives2 and brought her home with jewels of gold and lapis lazuli and
a retinue of thirty slaves; he brought also horses, chariots wrought with
gold or electrum, bulls and small cattle, flat dishes of gold "which could
not be weighed," fiat dishes of silver, a gold horn inlaid with lapis lazuli,
"much silver," 823 jars of incense, 1718 jars of honeyed wine, ivory,
precious wood, "all the luxuries of this country."
The next year ("year 25") Pharaoh returned to Palestine for inspection.
This time he visited northern Palestine (Upper Retenu). On his way he
admired the gardens of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Many of these
gardens, rich in color, form, and fragrance, were transplanted to Egypt:
All plants that grow, all flowers that are in God's land which were found by his majesty, when
his majesty proceeded to Upper Retenu.3
As in the Punt bas-reliefs of Hatshepsut, this land is called God's Land
(Divine Land). Following the peaceful expedition of Hatshepsut, when
only thirty-one almug trees were transferred to the soil of Egypt, the
tribute-collecting expedition of Thutmose III transferred entire botanical
collections. These collections are reproduced on the walls of the Karnak
temple, showing various and peculiar shapes of the flora of Palestine
some twenty-eight and a half centuries ago. A zoological collection was
also taken along; no inscription mentions it, but the figures of animals
appear among the plants on the bas-relief.
His majesty said, "I swear, as Re loves me, as my father Amon favors me, all these things
happened in truth."
Looking at these pictures, we remember what was said about
Solomon, whose royal pleasure was to collect and study plants and
animals.



I KINGS 4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the
hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping
things, and of fishes.
Botanists4 recognize among the plants brought by Thutmose III the
blue lotus, the vine date tree, the pomegranate, the dragon plant, the
arum, the iris, the chrysanthemum, as well as the cornflower and
mandragora, also a variety of pine tree and some sort of "melon tree."
Many of the plants, however, cannot be identified at a11.5
It seems certain that various specimens of flora as pictured on the
Karnak bas-relief were not indigenous to Palestine. How, then, explain
the presence of these plants among those brought by Thutmose III from
Palestine?
"Possibly, the twofold geographical designation, Palestine and God's
Land, could be explained by the fact that a number of plants actually
came from God's Land. Still another conjecture to explain the presence
of these plants may be made, namely that princes of distant countries
sent messengers with gifts to the pharaoh while on his war of
expedition."6
The second surmise is strange; it is unusual for remote countries to
send plants and birds to warriors on their march of conquest. The first
surmise merely illustrates the type of conjecture necessary in order to
evade the identification of Palestine with God's Land.
As has already been said, part of the flowers and other plants appear
not to be native to Palestine, and some of them cannot be identified at
all. Since the forms were drawn by an accurate hand, this conclusion
was reached: "These plants, rare at the time of Thutmose III, do not exist
in our day."
Solomon had trees brought on ships from countries lying more than a
year's voyage distant. No wonder that in the booty of Thutmose III there
were plants strange to the Palestine of today; they were strange to the
southeastern corner of the Mediterranean even in the days of Thutmose
III. This may be concluded from the circumstance that the pharaoh
brought them home from his military expedition and had them depicted
on the walls of the Karnak temple, like the treasures of gold and silver;
though cultivated in Palestine, these plants were exotic and rare.



Among the plants are carvings of animals; better preserved are the
figures of fowl. A zoologist has recognized many varieties of the birds,
but some seemed to him to be fantastic inventions of the sculptor,7 as
they are unknown in the East. We know that the ships of Tharshish
brought back peacocks (I Kings 10:22; II Chronicles 9:21); surely
Solomon collected not merely one species of birds. And it was his
zoological garden that was carried by the pharaoh to Egypt as well as the
treasures of his Temple and palace.
Today, in the reliefs of Deir el Bahari and Karnak, we may gaze on the
people of Judah of the days of Solomon, the animals and the plants they
raised, and the objects they cherished.

Genubath, King of Edom
Edom, like Israel, was ruled by a chief appointed by the Theban king.
Hadad the Edomite had a son by the sister of Tahpenes, the queen of
Ahmose, and his name was Genubath.
I KINGS 11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bore him [Hadad] Genubath his son, whom
Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the
sons of Pharaoh.
Hadad had returned to Edom in the days of Solomon, after the death
of Joab.1 Since then about forty years had elapsed. Genubath, his son,
was now the vassal king of Edom; he dwelt either in Edom or in Egypt.



Tribute from this land, too, must have been sent to the Egyptian
crown; there was no need to send an expedition to subdue Edom. When
Thutmose III returned from one of his inspection visits to Palestine he
found in Egypt tribute brought by couriers from the land "Genubatye,"
which did not have to be conquered by an expeditionary force.
When his majesty arrived in Egypt the messengers of the Genubatye came bearing their
tribute.2
It consisted of myrrh, "negroes for attendants," bulk, calves, besides
vessels laden with ivory, ebony, and skins of panther.
Who were the people of Genubatye? Hardly a guess has been made
with regard to this peculiar name. The people of Genubatye were the
people of Genubath, their king, contemporary of Rehoboam.
The year before, in the seventh year after the campaign of Me-giddo
and Jerusalem, Thutmose III, using his stronghold of Megiddo as a base
and assisted by the fleet captured from the Sidonians, pushed northward
to Arvad.
"On his return to Egypt he took with him the children of the native
princes to be educated in friendship toward Egypt, that they might be
sent back gradually to replace the old hostile generation of Syrian
princes."3
Behold, the children of the chiefs and their brothers were brought to be in strongholds in
Egypt. Now whosoever died among these chiefs, his majesty would cause his son to stand in
his place.4
This is a policy similar to that applied in the case of Hadad and
Genubath, the Edomites.

Princess Ano
In the Greek version of the Old Testament - the Septuagint - made in
Alexandria in Egypt in the third century B.C., there is found the



information that when Jeroboam heard in Egypt of Solomon's death he
spoke in the ears of the king of Egypt, saying, "Let me go,- and I will
depart into my land." And Susakirn ( Shishak) gave to Jeroboam to be
his wife Ano, the eldest sister of Thelkemina, his own wife. She was great
among the daughters of the king, and she bore to Jeroboam Abijah.1
This information is of importance because it gives us the name of the
queen's sister; the extant Hebrew Bible told us only that Jeroboam fled
abroad "to Shishak, king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of
Solomon." According to the Septuagint, Jeroboam received an Egyptian
princess for a wife, like Hadad the Edomite only one generation earlier (I
Kings 11:19).
In the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York there is pre-served a
canopic jar bearing the name of Princess Ano.2 The time when the jar
originated has been established on stylistic grounds as that of Thutmose
III. No other references to a princess of such name is found in any
Egyptian source or document. The existence of a princess by the name
of Ano in the days of Thutmose III lends credence to the information
contained in the Septuagint and gives additional support to the
identification of Shishak or Susakim of the Septuagint with the pharaoh
we know by the name Thutmose III.

"The Astounding Civilization"
In addition to the bas-reliefs on the walls of Karnak, a number of other
monuments show the wealth brought from Palestine by Thutmose III.
Among these monuments the tombs of Rekkaire,1 vizier of Thutmose III,
and Menkheperre-Seneb, high priest, rank first. Vessels and furniture are
shown en route from Palestine to Egypt. Chariots, too, of gold and silver,
were among the booty of Thutmose, and were given as presents to his
favorites.
The various works of art from Palestine were very much appreciated in
the Egyptian capital, and the artisans of Palestine were brought captive
to Egypt, there to work at their crafts. On the walls of the sepulchral
chambers of the vizier, coppersmiths are shown, and it is written:



"Bringing the Asiatic copper[-smiths] which his majesty captured in the
victories in Retenu." Over cabinetmakers from Palestine appear the
words: "Making chests of ivory, ebony." There are brick makers, too,
working to build the Amon temple,2 and next to them is the inscription:
"Captives which his majesty brought for the works of the temple of
Amon." "The taskmaster, he says to the builders: 'The rod is in my hand;
be not idle."
All this was regarded as proof that the Canaanites, the indigenous
population of Palestine, were skilled in the arts, strange as this may
seem: "We learn from the booty carried into Egypt - chariots inlaid with
silver, gold-plated chariots, etc. - of the astounding civilization of Syria at
that period."3
We know now that the astounding civilization, the products of which
we see on these monuments, was not Canaanite but Israelite. It is
therefore of interest to read what role the modem historians ascribe to
the Canaanites in the process of the development of Egyptian art and in
the refinement of the Egyptian race; it is an opinion as unbiased as
criticism of the works of an artist whose name is concealed by a
pseudonym.
"At this time (Thutmose III , 1503-1449) the Syrians stood at a higher
stage of civilization than even the wonderfully gifted race of Egypt. The
plunder carried back to Egypt of coats of mail, of gold-plated chariots, of
chariots inlaid with silver, witnesses to an industrial and artistic
development that was able to teach Egypt. With all these precious goods
went captives, who fell to working in the Nile valley at the crafts to which
they were accustomed at home, and as they worked they taught the
Egyptians. . . . The Syrian craftsmen worked so well in Egypt that their
wares changed even the taste of the Egyptians, while the language was
semitized, and the method of writing gradually developed into a smooth
flowing and graceful style. Under the great influx of foreign blood even
the features of the conquering race were changed into a less bold and
more delicate form. Egypt had never known such changes since the
beginning of the monarchy."4
It is also worth while to notice the chariots, gold-plated and inlaid with
silver, captured by Thutmose III in Palestine. "The song of songs, which is
Solomon's" is supposed to be a creation of a late period, and the
mention of luxury in the time of Solomon is thought to be a product of



the poet's fancy. "King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of
Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
gold, the covering of it of purple." The Egyptian monuments show that in
the fifth year after Solomon, in Jerusalem and also in Megiddo, there
was not one but many chariots of gold and silver.
We thus discard our supposed knowledge of the Canaanite art of the
sixteenth and fifteenth centuries B.C., and we begin to acquire some
knowledge of the Jewish art of the tenth century, about which the history
of art was thought to be ignorant.
1 Breasted, Records, Vol. II, Sec. 760, on the tomb of Relchmire: "This is one of the most
important scenes preserved in ancient Egypt. Similar scenes will be found in other Theban tombs,
but none contains so elaborate, detailed, and extensive representation of the wealth of the Asiatic
peoples, which was now flowing as tribute into the treasury of the Pharaohs."
2 Ibid., Sec. 758: ". . . of particular interest are the Semitic foreigners, who appear among the brick
makers, of the captivity which his majesty brought for the works of the temple of Amon. This is, of
course, precisely what was afterwards exacted of the Hebrews."

God's Land and Rezenu1
The present chapter shows the conquest of Palestine by Thutmose III
to have taken place, not in the Canaanite period, but in the days of the
Jewish kings, and more precisely in the fifth year of Rehoboam, son of
Solomon. In the preceding chapter the expedition of Queen Hatshepsut
to the land of Punt was shown to have taken place in the days of King
Solomon, and the land visited to have been Judea and probably
Phoenicia too. In other words, we assume that Queen Hatshepsut on her
peaceful journey and Thutmose on his military expeditions visited the
same country.
We are now in a position that will either trap us or furnish us with
additional proof that Queen Hatshepsut went to Palestine on her famous
expedition, and not to eastern Africa. Is not this . point essential for the
identification of Queen Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba?
The assumption that the people of God's Land in the pictures of
Hatshepsut were people of Palestine can be easily proved or disproved



by comparing these pictures with the figures of men with shields on the
Karnak mural symbolizing the conquest of Palestine. In both cases
Egyptian artists of practically the same generation did the sculpturing.
They were masters in depicting the characteristic features of different
races. Drawings of various ages are preserved in which Egyptian artists
have made collections of racial types. A glance at the people of God's
Land, the "people of the South," and the Egyptians on the bas-reliefs of
the expedition to Punt may help us to understand the fine feeling these
artists possessed for expressing the types of their own and of foreign
races.
The same characteristic profiles, the same hair styles, with a ribbon
around the hair tied behind, and the same long beard shaped as a
prolongation of a pointed chin make it certain that types of one and the
same people were pictured on the bas-reliefs of both Hatshepsut and
Thutmose III.
But, one might ask, if Thutmose III went to the same country to which
Hatshepsut had gone two or three decades earlier, why did he not call
the country of his conquest, Rezenu (Palestine), by the same names that
Hatshepsut called it, God's Land and Punt?
Year after year Thutmose III returned to Palestine to collect tribute (II
Chronicles 12:8: ". . . they shall be his servants"). Three years after the
conquest of Megiddo, Kadesh, and other cities, he had carved on the
walls at Karnak pictures of trees and plants that he had brought from
Palestine, with this inscription, already quoted: "Plants which his majesty
found in the land of Retenu. All plants that grow, all flowers that are in
God's Land which were found by his majesty when his majesty
proceeded to Upper Retenu" 2
This sentence induced the translator to conjecture that "God's Land is
sometimes applied to Asia."3
The sixth campaign of Thutmose III, like the first, was military: he
conquered the north of Syria. Three years later he went to Palestine to
gather the levy. After describing the tribute obtained from Shinar and
Kheta and the land of Naharin, the register reads:
"Marvels brought to his majesty in the land of Punt in this year: dried
myrrh . . ." The translator was surprised by this phrase .4 We find that



Thutmose HI used the same terms as Hatshepsut - Punt and God's Land
- for the land they visited - Phoenicia-Palestine.
The question that arises is: Did Palestine produce myrrh, referred to in
the account of the tribute, and frankincense, mentioned among the gifts
Hatshepsut received in God's Land?
Myrrh and frankincense are repeatedly mentioned in Egyptian
inscriptions as products of Punt. Frankincense ( olibanum) falls in dear
drops which, when gathered and formed into balls or sticks, turn white.
Because of its color the precious incense is called "white" in various
languages (Greek, Arabic), likewise in Hebrew (lebana, white). The less
precious incense, ladanum, is yellow or brown in color.5 Frankincense
grows in only a very few places, Somaliland and southern Arabia on
opposite shores of the Red Sea being areas which produce it even today.
The botanists were guides to the archaeologists in search of the land of
Punt.
After his fifth visit of inspection to conquered Syria and Palestine,
Thutmose III listed frankincense, oil, honey, and wine as tribute.
Following his ninth visit, he stated that he had received as "Retenu
tribute in this year" horses, chariots, various silver vessels of the
workmanship of the country, and also "dry myrrh, incense 693 jars,
sweet oil and green oil 2080 jars, and wine 608 jars."
Of his seventh campaign he wrote: "Tribute of the princes of Retenu,
who came to do obeisance. . . . Now, every harbor at which his majesty
arrived was supplied with loaves and with assorted loaves, with oil,
incense, wine, honey, fruit - abundant were they beyond everything. . . .
The harvest of the land of Retenu was reported consisting of much clean
grain, grain in the kernel [not ground], barley, incense [frankincense],
green oil, wine, fruit, every pleasing thing of the country.6
Myrrh and frankincense were products of Palestine. Let us see whether
the Scriptures give any indication that they were products of the Holy
Land in the days of Solomon. In the "Song of songs, which is
Solomon's," the enamored prince says to the little shepherdess (4:6):
"Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the
mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense."
Even if it was written later, the song speaks of the time of Solomon.



Lebanah (frankincense) near Beth-el (Judges 21:19) was prob-ably
the place where the incense plant grew. In the time of Thutmose III the
rare plants of the Palestinian gardens were transferred to Egypt, as he
himself told and pictured. Thereafter, in the days of Isaiah (60:6) and
Jeremiah (6:20), incense was imported into Palestine from southern
Arabia.
It is appropriate here to explain the name "Retenu" or "Rezenu" often
employed in the Egyptian inscriptions of the New Kingdom to designate
Palestine. Galilee is called "Upper Rezenu." "Rezenu" is apparently a
transcription of the name used by the population of Palestine for their
land. The Hebrew language must be questioned on its meaning.
In the Scriptures Palestine is frequently called "Erez" (country), "Erez
Israel" (the land of Israel), and "Arzenu" (possessive case, "our country").7
What the Egyptologists read as Retenu or Rezenu is probably the
"Arzenu" of the Bible.
In only one inscription of the Middle Kingdom (Twelfth Dy-nasty)
under Sesostris is the name Rezenu mentioned - it is a very short
account of a raid into that country against M-n-tyw. As we shall find the
same name, Mntyw, in Egyptian documents of a much later period, that
of King Menashe (Manasseh), the Mntyw of the Middle Kingdom must
mean the tribe Menashe. If the inscription is correctly attributed to the
time of Sesostris III, the mention of the tribe Menashe would imply that
before the Israelites had come to stay in Egypt they had dwelt in
Palestine, not as a single patriarchal family, but as tribes strong enough
to be regarded as enemies by the pharaoh. This would accord with the
tradition of a defeat inflicted by Abraham and the servants of his
household on the kings of Shinar and Elam and their allies ( Genesis
14), and with the number of the Israelites ( about two million, including
women and children) in the days of the Exodus, after some two hundred
years of sojourning in Egypt.

Sosenk (Shoshenk)
According to conventional history, Thutmose III and the whole
Eighteenth Dynasty ruled over a Canaanite Palestine. Shishak, the
pharaoh who carried away the vessels from the Temple at Jerusalem,
was sought in the period that followed by some hundred years the epoch
of the Ramessides. The Ramessides were the last great pharaohs of the
imperial era in Egypt.
Among the names of the kings of the rather obscure period which the
historians dealing with Egypt extend over six hundred years (until the
conquest of Egypt by Cambyses in - 525), a hieroglyphic name is found
which reads "Sosenk." This king of the Libyan Dynasty cut the names of
cities subject to him on the outside of the southern wall of the Karnak
temple. These cities are represented by figures like the city-figures of
Thutmose's bas-relief, and it is obvious that Sosenk copied that mural.
But whereas Thutmose's list consists of well-known names familiar from
the Scriptures, Sosenk's list contains mostly unknown names. The
accompanying inscription consists "of stereotyped phrases . . . too vague,
general and indecisive to furnish any solid basis for a study of Sosenk's
campaign. Had we not the brief reference in the Old Testament to his
sack of Jerusalem, we should hardly have been able to surmise that the
relief was the memorial of a specific campaign."1
And yet Sosenk is presented as the scriptural Shishak in all textbooks
and manuals. However, it is admitted that "the date of Shishak's
accession is dependent on Israelite chronology. 2
The relief has one hundred and fifty-five names of cities.3 "Only
seventeen can be located with certainty, and two more with probability.
Fourteen of these belong to Israel; they are mostly unimportant towns
while the remaining five in Judah are, with one exception, obscure
villages."4
Among the Palestinian cities the following were identified be-cause of
phonetic similarity: Beth-Shan, Hapharaim, Gibeon, Megiddo, "and the



most interesting is p'-hw-k-rw' - 'b'-f-m or Hekel Abram, which can be
nothing else than 'the Field of Abram.' "5/sup
There are, as a matter of fact, a number of p'-hw-k-rw', and each of
them is identified as hekel, "field" (in Aramaic). No locality by the name
of Hekel Abram is known to have been in Judah or Israel, nor is any
other Hekel6 Almost no name could be located in all of Judah, as the
few "obscure villages" were mere guesses. This gives the impression that
only Israel was subject to Sosenk (Shoshenk), not Judah. Neither
Jerusalem, Hebron, Beer-Sheba, Bethlehem, nor any other known place
was among the names on the list; nor was Jaffa, Gath, or Askelon.7
The inscription refers in general terms to tribute given to Sosenk, but
where are the spoils, the furniture and vessels of the Temple of Solomon
and of his palace? Was "Shishak" so modest that he did not mention the
capital he conquered and the rich booty of the Temple, and at the same
time so vainglorious that he piled up a list of names of non-existent
cities?
Thutmose III, on the other hand, is said to have invaded pre-Israelite
Canaan some five or six hundred years before the time ascribed to
Shishak, conquered cities and strongholds built much later in the time of
Judges or Kings, and taken from Canaan an immense plunder of sacred
vessels and furniture in gold, silver, and brass (bronze), which six
hundred years later were copied by Solomon in form and even in
numbers and described in the Book of Kings.
Is this not a dubious construction? Is not the attribution of the art
products to the Canaanites based on error? But if this is so, then who
was this Libyan Sosenk who received tribute from the northern realm
(Israel) hundreds of years subsequent to the time of Jeroboam and
Rehoboam? In the pages dealing with the period of the Libyan Dynasty
he will be identified as Pharaoh So to whom Hoshea, the last king of the
northern realm, sent tribute (II Kings 17:4).

Summary
The generation that followed Queen Hatshepsut in Egypt was
synchronized in this chapter with the generation that followed King
Solomon in Palestine. In Egypt it was the time of the pharaoh known to
us from modern history books as Thutmose III; in Palestine it was the
time of Rehoboam, son of Solomon, and Jeroboam of the northern
kingdom. The two countries, Egypt and Palestine, came into close
contact. The pharaoh invaded Judea and, according to the Egyptian and
scriptural narratives alike, "took all the cities" and approached the
capital, called Kadesh in the annals of the pharaoh and in the Scriptures
called both Jerusalem and Kadesh. The conquest of Palestine is
described almost identically in the Book of Kings and Chronicles and in
the Egyptian annals. The country "fell into disagreement"; after an
unsuccessful attempt to defend the land, the fortresses and other towns
submitted; princes and their households gathered in the capital. By
consent of the king and the princes the capital was thrown open and
they "humbled themselves." The palace and the Temple of the capital
were sacked and the vessels and furniture carried to Egypt. The detailed
description of these furnishings and utensils, as preserved in the Books of
Kings and Chronicles, agrees perfectly with the pictures engraved on the
walls of the Karnak temple. The objects are of identical form and shape,
of the same workmanship, of the same number: altars, lavers, tables,
candlesticks, fountains, vases with rims of "buds and flowers," and cups
of lotus shape, and vases of semiprecious stone, and priestly ephods,
gold shields, and doors overlaid with copper.
The captives on the bas-relief representing captured cities are of the
same race and appearance as the people of Punt and the Divine Land
visited by Queen Hatshepsut one generation earlier, again proving that
Hatshepsut went on her peaceful expedition to Palestine. Among the
cities captured by Thutmose III were cities built by Solomon and
Rehoboam, which were not found in the complete list of Canaan in the



time of Joshua's conquest; however, according to the conventional
chronology, Thutmose III preceded Joshua.
The biblical references to golden chariots in the days of Solomon are
demonstrated to be true. Such chariots were brought by the pharaoh
from Palestine. Also craftsmen from Palestine were employed in Egypt.
Judea became a dependency and its people vassals to the pharaoh.
On his repeated expeditions to collect tribute the pharaoh took back with
him frankincense, a product of the land. This, by the way, shows that the
frankincense brought by Hatshepsut from the Divine Land was a
Palestinean product; and the pharaoh actually refers to the products of
Punt and of the Divine Land in connection with his expedition to
Palestine. He also transferred to Egypt the zoological and botanical
collections of King Solomon.
Jeroboam, while in Egypt as a refugee from Solomon, married a
queen's sister by the name of Ano. A canopic jar with her name on it,
dating from the time of Thutmose III, is preserved in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
Genubath is referred to in the Book of Kings as the son of the
Ed.ornite ldng Hadad in exile, born in the palace of the pharaohs and
reared there in the days of David and Solomon. He is mentioned by
name in the annals of Thutmose III as the prince of the vassal land
paying tribute to the pharaoh.
The time of Hatshepsut was that of Solomon; and the time of
Thutmose III was that of Rehoboam, Solomon's son, and Jeroboam, his
rival.



Chapter V
RAS SHAMRA
The Timetable of Minoan and Mycenaean Culture
ON A SPRING day in 1928 a peasant plowing his field near the
shore of Ras Shamra in northern Syria lifted the stone of a burial
vault. In 1929 and in the following years, in twelve seasons of
excavation,)1 buildings of a city and its harbor were unearthed
together with pottery, utensils, jewelry, and the tablets of a library.
This obscure place, not even marked on maps, lies to the north of
Latakia, the ancient Laodicea ad mare, at a point on the Syrian
coast opposite the elongated arm of land stretching out from
Cyprus toward the mainland on the east. On a bright afternoon the
island can be seen from the hills surrounding Ras Shamra.
The place was tentatively identified as Ugarit of the el-Amarna
letters,2 and written documents found there confirmed this
conjecture. In gray antiquity the city had been repeatedly reduced
to ruins. The levels at which dwellings were dug up are numbered
from I to V starting at the surface. The first or uppermost layer is
the most explored, but in the first nine archaeological seasons only
about one eighth of this level had been unearthed. Digging in
deeper strata has been confined to very small areas. The second
layer yielded a few objects of Egyptian origin of the time of the
Middle Kingdom; during the Middle Kingdom the north Syrian
coast was in the sphere of Egyptian influence. At a depth of more
than ten meters still older civilizations have come to light; remnants
of the Neolithic (Late Stone) Age were found on the underlying
rock.



The age of the remains found in the upper layer, which is only
from forty centimeters to two meters under the surface, was
established before the inscriptions were read. The material, design,
and workmanship of pottery are held to be a reliable calendar in
the hands of the archaeologists. The ceramics of the necropolis of
Minet el Beida (the harbor of Ras Shamra) and of the acropolis of
Ras Shamra were found to be of Cyprian origin and also of
Mycenaean manufacture of the fifteenth and fourteenth and part of
the thirteenth centuries B.C..3
When a few Egyptian objects were found in this layer, too, the
experts' identification of them as belonging to the Eighteenth and
Nineteenth Dynasties4 gave fair support to the time determination
made on the basis of the pottery; the period during which Ugarit
enjoyed prosperity was placed in the fifteenth century, and the
fourteenth century was recognized as the one that saw the sudden
decline of the city.
As two different methods had been applied and both led to
similar conclusions, there was no further questioning of the age of
the site, and all publications dealing with Ras Shamra-Ugarit5 are
based on the premise that the literary and cultural remnants from
the excavated layer were products of the fifteenth and fourteenth
centuries.
Before going further, we must appraise the real value of ceramics
and other objects of art from Mycenae and Crete in dealing with
time reckoning. In the course of this discussion I shall also have a
few words to say on the age of the Minoan and Mycenaean
cultures.
In Knossos on the northern shore of Crete, in Phaestus on the
southern shore, and in other places on the island, remnants of a
culture were found which is called Minoan, from the name of the
semi-legendary king Minos. The remains belong to various epochs.
The palace at Knossos and other buildings were suddenly
destroyed, giving place to a new palace and buildings, which were
again destroyed and again rebuilt. Many reasons led the explorer of



these antiquities to the belief that a natural catastrophe was the
agent of destruction, which marked the end of one period and the
beginning of another.6 The ages are divided into Early, Middle, and
Late Minoan, and each age is divided into three parts, I, II, and .
Another culture recognizable by its characteristic pottery had its
center in Mycenae on the mainland of Greece. It, too, is divided
into Early, Middle, and Late Mycenaean or Helladic Ages, which
correspond roughly to the Minoan Ages of Crete.
The Minoan and Helladic Ages begin with the end of the Stone
Age and are subdivisions of the Bronze Age. There is no internal
evidence that would help to fix the dates of the Minoan-Mycenaean
Ages. The scripts of Crete have not yet been deciphered, despite
some promising efforts, and the contacts with Egypt are regarded
as the only source for establishing a timetable in the Minoan
Mycenaean past7 With some deviations, the Old, Middle, and New
Kingdoms of Egypt are held to be the counterparts of the Early,
Middle, and Late Minoan and Helladic Ages.
At Knossos of the Early Minoan period were found vases similar
to pottery unearthed at Abydos in Egypt of the First Dynasty. Seals
of the type of the Sixth Egyptian Dynasty were found in Crete.
During the Middle Minoan period there was active intercourse
between Crete and Egypt. At Abydos, in a tomb dating from the
Twelfth Dynasty, a polychrome vase of the Middle Minoan II period
was found, and at Knossos a statuette dating from the Twelfth or
Thirteenth Dynasty was discovered. The dating of the Middle
Minoan Age "of course depends upon that assigned to the Twelfth
Dynasty.8
Crete was ruined by a catastrophe that corresponds in time to
the catastrophe of the Exodus (the end of the Middle Kingdom and
the end of the Middle Minoan II period). After the Middle Minoan
period, which corresponds to the time of the Hyksos rule in Egypt
(the name of the Hyksos pharaoh Kilian was found on the lid of a
jar at Knossos ), Crete freed herself from the influence of Egypt. It
had its renaissance in the Late Minoan I period, which corresponds



in timeto the Egyptian renaissance after the expulsion of the
Hyksos.
At Mycenae on the Greek mainland also were unearthed a few
Egyptian objects bearing the cartouches of Amenhotep II,
Amenhotep , and his wife Tiy, of the Eighteenth Dynasty (New
Kingdom); vases of the Late Mycenaean style were dug up in large
numbers in Egypt, in Thebes, and especially from under the ruined
walls of Akhnaton's palace at el-Amarna, "which thus gives a fixed
date (about 1380 B.c.) for this style of vase-painting."9
The present research endeavors to bring to light a mistake of
more than 'half a millennium in the conventional Egyptian
chronology of the New Kingdom. If Akhnaton flourished in - 840
and not in - 1380, the ceramics from Mycenae found in the palace
of Akbnaton are younger by five or six hundred years than they are
presumed to be, and the Late Mycenaean period would
accordingly move forward by half a thousand years on the scale of
time.
It is my contention that the glorious Eighteenth Dynasty, the
Kingdom of David and Solomon, and the Late Minoan and Late
Mycenaean periods started simultaneously, about the year 1000
B.C..
Returning to the excavations of Ras Shamra, we find that there
were not two separate and coinciding time clues in the ceramics
and bronze from Crete and Mycenae and in Egyptian pieces of art,
but ultimately only a single one: the timetables of Crete and
Mycenae are built upon the chronology of Egypt: This will also be
shown in more detail in the chapter in which problems of
stratigraphic archaeology are explored.

Sepulchral Chambers
The question which now arises is: Are there not other finds besides
the ceramics which support or challenge the generally accepted
view that the upper layer of the Ras Shamra excavations belongs to
the period from the fifteenth to the fourteenth centuries? Does the
testimony of architecture and of written documents support the
conventional chronology or do they strengthen the view
maintained here that this stratum and the past it buried are of the
period from the tenth to the ninth or eighth centuries?
The chambers of the necropolis, unlike the buildings of the
acropolis, are preserved intact. In a typical tomb well-arranged
stone steps lead to a sepulchral chamber with arched ceiling.
Similar vaults have been found in Cyprus. The excavator of Ras
Shamra wrote of them: "Those in Cyprus are considerably later
and continue down to the eighth and seventh centuries, according
to the Swedish excavators.1 One might therefore consider these
Cypriote tombs to be late copies of the chamber tombs at Ras
Shamra. One fine example is the burial vault of Trachonas on the



east coast of the Karpas peninsula, exactly facing Ras Shamra.
However, until earlier tombs of this type have been found in
Cyprus, direct affiliation cannot be claimed. Some five hundred
years lie between the Trachonas tomb and those of Ras Shamra.."2
The vaults on Cyprus across the strait and in Ras Shamra are of
identical construction; they must have been built in the same age.
The distortion of chronology makes it necessary to maintain that
five hundred years elapsed before the Cypriotes started copying the
Ras Shamra vaults, which by then would have been covered with
earth and concealed from the human eye. Or it must be said that
despite the obvious similarity of the peculiar vaults on both sides of
the strait, no affiliation had occurred because of the five hundred
years' difference in time.
In addition to the form of the sepulcher and its vault, a
characteristic feature of the tombs of Ras Shamra's necropolis is a
device which served for the offering of libations. It is an aperture
with a pipe in it through which fluid food was delivered to the dead
to sustain the soul on its journey to the other world.
It is obviously a very forced explanation to say that the
population of Cyprus allowed half a millennium to elapse before
they began to copy the tombs of the necropolis of Ras Shamra (
Minet el Beida). Indeed, this explanation is utterly untenable, not
only because of much archaeological material demonstrating that
the influence came from Cyprus to the mainland and not the other
way round, but especially because of the pottery found in the
graves. The following statement was published after the first year of
excavation at Ras Shamra:
"The influence which appears to dominate, if not at Ras Shamra
itself, then, at least, at the near-by necropolis of Minet el Beida, is
that of the island of Cyprus. The graves of Minet el Beida are of
Cyprian shape and construction, and the vases of painted baked
clay of which the funeral equipment largely consists, are very
clearly and almost all Cyprian."3

Greek Elements in the Writings of Ras Shamra
Ras Shamra was not merely a maritime city that traded in arms of
Cyprian copper and in wine, oil, and perfume: jars, flagons, and
flacons were found there by the hundreds; it was also a city of
learning: there was a school for scribes and a library. In the school
the future scribes were taught to read and to write at least four
languages.
Tablets of clay were found in the dust under the crushed walls of
a building, destroyed by human hand or by the unleashed forces of
nature. The entire collection is written in cuneiform, in four
different languages. Two of the languages were easily read:
Sumerian, "the Latin" or the "dead language" of the scholars, and
Akkadian, the tongue of business and politics in the Babylonian
world.
Business letters in Akkadian, commercial receipts, and orders
were read. Two tablets very similar to those of the el-Amarna
collection were also found,1 and with them the connection of Ras
Shamra with Egypt at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty was firmly
established. Some large tablets are lexicons, bilingual and even
trilingual. On some of the tablets there is a "copyright" mark: it is a
statement that these tablets were made at the order of Nikmed,
king of Ugarit.
Nikomedes is an old Greek narne.2 The similarity between the
name Nikomedes, regarded as originally an Ionian name, and the
name of the Ugaritian King Nikmed, is so obvious that, after
deciphering the name of the king, two scholars,3 working
independently, related it to the Greek name. Other scholars,



however, rejected this equation of the name of the king Nikmed
(who also wrote his name Nikmes and Nikmedes) with Nikomed
(Nikomedes) of the Greeks, asking how an Ionian name could
have been in use in the fourteenth century before this era. Those
who made the identification were unable to defend their position
against the mathematics of conventional chronology.4
Ugarit was a maritime commercial city; its population was
composed of various ethnic groups. One document found there
describes the expulsion of King Nikmed and all the foreign groups
in the city. Among them were people of Alasia (Cyprus), Khar (
explained to be Hurrites ), and Jm'an. The last name was identified
by the decipherers as Jamanu, which is well known from the
Assyrian inscriptions, and means Ionians.5 This interpretation of
Jm'an was disputed for no other reason than that in the fourteenth
century a reference to Ionians would have been impossible. In the
same inscription, at a point where the names of the expelled are
repeated, the name Diclyme appears. The decipherers took it to be
the name of the city of Didyma in Ionia.6 This city was renowned
for its cult of Apollo Didymeus. Again, the name of the deity
Didymeus (Ddms ) was inscribed on another Ras Shamra tablet;
the decipherers,7 turning neither left nor right, translated it "Apollon
Didymeus." Now antiquities have been brought from the site of
Didyma, originating from the eighth century.8 But in the fifteenth or
fourteenth century neither Ionians nor the shrine of Apollo
Didymeus could have been mentioned. Chronology could not
square with the Ionian names of Nikomed, or the name of the
Ionian city of Didyma, or the Greek cult of the god of that city, or
the very name Ionians in the Ras Shamra texts - but all these were
there, and no explanation was put forth in place of the rejected
theory about an Ionian colony from the city of Didyma near Milet
in Ionia _that came to Ugarit and was expelled together with the
king of Ionian origin, Nilaned.9 It could only be stated that there
was not a grain of probability in such a reading of texts belonging
to the middle of the second millennium.



Among the tablets found in Ras Shamra there is a "catalogue of
ships." It is an enumeration, for lexicographic purposes, of the
various forms and uses of military and commercial vessels. Cargo
ships, passenger ships, racing boats, fishing smacks, ferries, war
vessels, and troop transports are listed. In the second book of the
Iliad there is a similar, famous catalogue of ships. This portion of
the Iliad was regarded as a later interpolation, but when a scholar10
) pointed out the similarity between the catalogues of Ras Shamra
and the Iliad, the commentary to this portion of the Iliad was
revised and one of opposite import substituted: "The catalogue, as
certain scholars now agree, would not be a later interpolation, but
has a long history behind it; as the Ras Shamra texts show, they
were drawing up such catalogues in the port of Ugarit many
centuries before the date of the Homeric lists."11
The Iliad is commonly supposed to have been put into writing in
the seventh century. As for the time of its origin, the views of
scholars from antiquity on differ widely, placing it anywhere from
the twelfth to the seventh century.
By placing King Nikmed at the end of the fifteenth and the
beginning of the fourteenth centuries, the only conclusion possible
from comparing the two "naval gazettes" was that hundreds of
years before the very earliest date for the Iliad there existed a
catalogue of ships which served as a model to the epic poet.

2 The semi-legendary Aristomenes, who led the people of Messene in their battles against
the Spartans in the years - 684 and - 683, was a son of Nikomedes - according to other
sources, of a Pyrrhos (F. Ilroznjr, "Les Ionians a Ras-Shamra," Archie Orientálni, IV [1932],
177). Aristotle mentions an Athenian archon of that name who flourished in - 483. The
name is also found later among the Spartans. In the third century Nikomedes I, king of
Bithynia on the eastern shore of the Bosphorus, built a new capital for himself,
Nikomedeia.

Hebrew Elements. Two Cities and Two Epochs Compared
The third language of the Ras Shamra tablets in cuneiform
(Sumerian and Akkadian being the first two) did not long retrain its
secret. The large tablets were apparently written in an alphabetic
script. Their cuneiform could not be an ideographic or syllabic
script, for a syllabic script like Akkadian uses hundreds of different
signs, but alphabetic script only a few; and in this third script there
were only thirty different characters.
An example of the simplification of the cuneiform script was
already known to the scholars: the Persians in the sixth century had
used cuneiform for an alphabet of thirty-six characters1
The bright idea came simultaneously to more than one scholar2
that it might be ancient Hebrew written in cuneiform. An attempt to
substitute Hebrew letters for cuneiform signs was successful, and
before the scholarly world were tablets in a legible language. Some
of the texts were even re-edited by modern scholars in Hebrew
characters.3



Reading was facilitated by strokes placed after each word by the
scribes of Ras Shamra-Ugarit. The Cyprian script of the sixth
century has the same characteristic stroke after each word, and this
similarity was stressed, but it was asserted that, before this
peculiarity returned, more than six hundred years had passed.4
Again six hundred years! As in the case of the sepulchral chambers,
it required six hundred years of latency before the Cypriotes started
to imitate their neighbors only sixty miles away.
With an eagerness comparable only to the avaricious excitement
of discoverers of a hidden treasure, scholars kindled their lamps
and read the messages in ancient Hebrew. They thought they
knew, even before they began to read, that the tablets were some
six hundred years older than the oldest known Hebrew inscription.
The discovery was startling: hundreds of years before the Israelites
entered Canaan, the Canaanites not only used Hebrew5 but wrote
it in an alphabetic script.6 Alphabetic writing in the fifteenth century
B.C. was a revelation for paleographers and scholars in the history
of human culture. "Since these documents date from the fourteenth
or fifteenth century, the Has Shamra alphabet is among the first
alphabets to be composed, and actually is the earliest yet known."7
The Hebrew-cuneiform alphabet of Ras Shamra is not a primitive
pioneer effort; it has features that indicate it was already in an
advanced stage. "The Has Shamra alphabet is already so advanced
that it implies the existence of a still earlier alphabet yet to be
found."8
What the aborigines of Canaan wrote down was even more
unexpected. In the mirror in which, in conformity with biblical
references to the Canaanites, it was expected that the face of a
wicked generation and of a low spiritual culture would be seen, the
face of a dignified people was reflected. In the Book of Leviticus
and in other books of the Scriptures iniquity and vice were
attributed to the Canaanites: the country was defiled by them."
This appeared to be a "biased attitude of Israelite historians. . . . As
it is, the Ras Shamra texts reveal a literature of a high moral tone,



tempered with order and justice. By means of these documents we
now see that the early Israelites differed in no way from the
Canaanites."9
The Hebrew texts of Has Shamra are mostly poems describing
the exploits and battles of the gods and the adventures and wars of
heroes. The pantheon of Ras Shamrai10 was composed of a
number of gods; Baal was one of them, but the supreme deity was
EI.11 The land of the Canaanites is sometimes called "the whole
land of El," and the supremacy of this deity ("no one can change
that which El has fixed"), known by the same name in the Bible as
the Lord of the Israelites, is regarded as "a clear indication of a
monotheistic tendency in the Canaanite religion?"12 However,
besides El being not the sole but the chief god, he is described in
the Ras Shamra texts in Homeric terms strange to the Old
Testament: "El laughs with his whole heart and snaps his fingers."
Besides the name El, which is predominant in the poems,
especially in the poem of Keret dealing with exploits in Negeb, the
name Yahu (Yahwe) is also encountered in the Ras Shamra texts.13
A few rare expressions or names found on Ras Shamra tablets
are found also on monuments of the seventh century B.C..14 '
A very unusual expression on one of the Ras Shamra tablets
"Astart, name of Baal" - appears in the epitaph of Eshmunazar, the
Phoenician king of Sidon of the fifth century.15
The mythological pictures of the Ras Shamra poems often em
ploy the same wording as the so-called mythological images of the
Scriptures. Leviathan is "a crooked serpent" (Isaiah 27:1); it has
several heads (Psalms 74:14). Lotan of the poems also is "a swift
and crooked serpent" and has seven heads. There is, in one of the
poems, an expression put into the mouth of El which sounds like a
reference to the great feat of tearing asunder the sea of Jam-Suf.
And the verb, "to tear asunder," used there and in Psalms ( 136:13)
is the same (gzr). The conclusion drawn from the similarity was



this: long before the Exodus and the passage through the Red Sea,
the Canaanites of Palestine knew this myth.16
The language of the poems of Ras Shamra is, in etymology and
syntax, "surprisingly akin"17 to the language, etymology, and syntax
of the Scriptures, and the characteristic dual and plural forms, both
masculine and feminine, are cited as examples.
The meter of the poems, the division into feet of three syllables
or three words, and the balancing of the theme (parallelism) are
also found in the Scriptures." 18 These rules are precisely those of
Hebrew poetry, and even the language from some of our Ras
Shamra texts is entirely Biblical."19 It was therefore concluded that
Hebrew and Phoenician alike derived from the Canaanite, which
could be called an Early Hebrew dialect:20
"There are striking similarities in the vocabulary, many words
and even locutions being identical!"21 in the Ras Shamra texts and
in the Old Testament. Here and there is found a turn of speech
known from the Psalms, as, for instance, "I watered my coach with
tears."
"The style resembles most the poetic books of the Old Testament,
and especially the Book of Isaiah."22 "We see that the Phoenicians
of the fourteenth century before our era used rhythm and poetical
forms that have all their development in the Song of Songs. . . .
There are even some composite terms which are identical in both
languages, such as the expression Beth-Haver, 'house of
association,' which occurs on one of the tablets and also in the
Book of Proverbs."23 In short, "there are innumerable parallels with
the Old Testament in vocabulary and poetic style,"24 and an
"intimate relationship existing between the Ras Shamra tablets and
the literature of the Old Testament."25
The religious cult, as reflected by poems and other texts of Ras
Shamra, also bore a certain resemblance to the cult of the
Israelites. There was a Rav Cohanim, a high priest; adzes with
engraved dedications to Rav, Cohanim were unearthed. The



offering called mattan tam, known from the service in the Temple
of Jerusalem, is mentioned in the Ras Shamra texts. Circumcision
was also practiced at Ras Shamra, judging from stone phalli found
in this Phoenician city 26
The Jewish law forbidding the people to boil a calf in the milk of
its mother was directed against a definite custom and a culinary
dish. This dish was enjoyed at Ras Shamra, as its writings reveal.
From all this the following conclusion was drawn: "The traditions,
culture and religion of the Israelites are bound up inextricably with
the early Canaanites. The compilers of the Old Testament were
fully aware of this, hence their obsession to break with such a past
and to conceal their indebtedness to it."27
Even in minute details the life in Ras Shamra of the fifteenth
century and the life in Jerusalem some six or seven hundred years
later were strildngly similar.
Isaiah, on a visit to the gravely sick king, Hezekiah, ordered a
debelah, a remedy made of figs, to be applied to the inflamed
wound. Debelah is registered in the pharmacopoeia of Ras
Shamra's medical men and is found mentioned in a veterinary
treatise. The deduction was therefore made: "The prophet made
use of a very old-fashioned remedy, known previously to the
veterinary surgeons at Ugarit in the fifteenth and fourteenth
centuries."28
This case of correspondence between the medical tablets of Ras
Shamra and the Scriptures is not unique: "In the same [veterinary]
treatise we also find some technical words corresponding exactly
with similar expressions in the Bible, which further emphasize this
contact between the Ras Shamra texts and the Old Testament."29
And the generalization concerning medicine was: "They [the
exactly corresponding technical words] establish a very striking
similarity in the medical knowledge of the Canaanites or
ProtoPhoenicians, and that of the times of the kings of Judah."30



The weights and measures of Ras Shamra were also those
known from the Scriptures. In the Sumero-Babylonian system a
talent was divided into 3600 shekels, but in the Scriptures (Exodus
38:25-27) the talent is composed of only 3000 shekels. Was this an
erroneous statement? In the Ras Shamra texts, too, the talent is
divided into 3000 shekels.31
Jewels of gold to adorn the maidens of Ras Shamra are
mentioned in the texts and were unearthed.32 "Now in the texts
three kinds of gold pendants are mentioned by the name of
`Astarte,' suns,' and `moons.' The word used for a sun pendant is
`shapash."Shapash' is identified with the word `shebis mentioned
in Isaiah 3.18 33 The same prophet alludes to crescents or
pendants in the form of the moon. So at Ras Shamra we find not
only mention of these pendants in the Canaanite texts but also the
ornaments themselves that Yahwe, in the passage cited in Isaiah,
will take away one day from the haughty daughters of Zion."34
The ornaments named in the curse of the prophet emerged out
of the earth. "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk
with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing
as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: Therefore the Lord
will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of
Zion. . . . In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
akhasim [anklets] and shebisim [suns] and shaharonim [crescents],
the chains, and the bracelets . . . and the earrings, the rings . . . and
the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins . . . the fine
linen, and the hoods, and the veils. . . . And her gates shall lament
and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground"
(Isaiah 3:16-26).
In the hour of sorrow and mourning dust was thrown over the
head, in ancient Ugarit and in Jerusalem alike, as the texts of the
tablets and the scrolls of the Old Testament testify.
All these revivals of style and meter, of religious myths and cult,
of old customs, of weights and measures, medical science, apparel,
and jewelry, emphasized and re-emphasized by modem scholars,



would definitely point to the co-existence of Ugarit with the
Jerusalem of the eighth or ninth century were it not for one
obstacle. This was the fact that the Ugarit texts and objects were
considered to be contemporaneous with the Egyptian and
Mycenaean worlds of the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries.

Bible Criticism and the Documents of Ras Shamra



For the past seventy years the doctrines of Bible criticism have
been taught from most cathedras of modem exegesis and are at last
being preached from many pulpits. Two of the fundamental
concepts have been: (1) before the time of the Kings (or before
1000) there were no written documents among the Israelites, and
(2) most passages of the Scriptures are of a later origin than the
Scriptures themselves suggest or rabbinical tradition ascribes to
them.
Since 1930 when the tablets of Ras Shamra were deciphered,
they have been regarded as proofs (1) that already in the fifteenth
century Hebrew was written in a highly perfected alphabetic script
that had a long period of development behind it, and (2) that many
biblical traditions and legends were alive, and biblical style, poetic
form, and ways of expression were in use some six hundred years
before the biblical books were composed, even according to
rabbinical tradition.
The confusion became great1 For three generations famous
scholars, to whose lectures students traveled from afar, writers for
encyclopedias, and authors of commentaries, all were moved to
decrease the age of the Old Testament and even to assume a post
evangelical editing of various parts of the Old Testament. The
whole argument was supported by linguistic considerations and by
a general theory of the natural development of religious thought. It
could be shown expertly that one or another expression in Psalms
or in Proverbs could not have been employed in the days of David
or Solomon in the tenth century, but was a product of the sixth to
third centuries. Now, in the Ras Shamra tablets of the fifteenth or
fourteenth century, the same expressions were found. A verdict of
later origin had been given on many portions of the prophets:
many passages were supposed to have been composed and
interpolated during the Hellenistic period, which followed the
conquest of Palestine by Alexander the Great in - 332, and many
sentences were supposed to have borne allusions to the events of
the Maccabean war against the Seleucides, almost six hundred
years after Isaiah. Now the same ideas and similar expressions



were found on Ras Shamra tablets of a period six or seven
hundred years before the time of the earlier prophets.
"With the present documents the history of the Hebrew language
and of Syrian culture is pushed back toward the middle of the
second pre-Christian millennium "2 All proofs of late origin and all
deductions based thereon become null and void before the
evidence of the clay tablets .s
Bible criticism went to great pains to deny to Judaism of the pre
exilic period many of its achievements. By advancing the date of
formulation of many social, moral, and religious imperatives of the
Old Testament to the post-exilic period, Bible criticism had them
originate in the Babylonian exile, referring some to the Seleucid
period and to the influence of Greek thought.
The new view, predominant since the excavations at Ras Shama,
also regards many social, religious, and cultural elements of the
Scriptures as copies, but of Canaanite originals;4 since they were
already in existence some six hundred years before the time the
Bible claims for them, they could not be of Jewish origin. The
Canaanites paved the way to Jewish concepts in religion; their
poetry had a high moral standard; their language, alphabet, style,
and rhythm were inherited by the Jews; the ethos of social justice
and the pathos of prophecy were Canaanitic hundreds of years
before they became Israelite.5 These and similar deductions were
dictated by the age attributed to the tablets of Ras Shamra. In face
of the striking parallels between the language, style, poetical forms,
technical expressions, moral ideas, religious thought, temple
ordinances, social institutions, treasury of legends and traditions,
medical knowledge, apparel, and jewelry as reflected in the Ras
Shamra tablets and in the pages of the Scriptures, the logical
conclusion would have been that the tablets and the Books of the
Scriptures containing these parallels are of the same age. But such
a deduction was not thought of, owing to the obstacles of
chronology already explained.



The revision of chronology requires the leveling of the time of
Ras Shamra (Level I from the surface) to the time of the kings of
Judea until Jehoshaphat. The presence of parallels in the life of
Palestine and of a contemporary Syrian town, where the languages
of neighboring peoples were learned, appears to be only natural.
If this reconstruction of world history by a correction of five to six
hundred years puts a strain on the customary notions of history,
how, then, can one's scientific conscience bridge a gap of double
dimension and reconcile the results of the industrious efforts of
Bible criticism with the archaeological finds of Ras Shamra? The
span is twelve centuries.

Troglodytes or Carians?
The fourth language written in cuneiform on the tablets of the Ras
Shamra library is called Khan. Words in Sumerian were
accompanied by explanations in Einar. It appears to have been the
local language, the language of the government and of a large part
of the population. Despite the help of the bilingual syllabic
dictionaries used by the scribes of Ras Shamra, the reading of Khar
is not final. Had the words in Khar been explained in Sumerian,
the task of the philologists would have been easier; but the
translation and explanation of Sumerian words in Khar did not give
all the necessary clues to the decipherers.
Before the excavations of Ras Shamra, frequent mention of "Khr"
had already been encountered in various archaeological



documents. Akkadian texts speak of "Khurri," and in Egyptian
documents a part of Syria is often called "Kharu."
It had long been held that these Assyrian and Egyptian
designations referred to the Horites or troglodytes of the early
chapters of the Scriptures.1
With the discovery of the Tell el-Amarna archives in Egypt it was
found that one of the letters of the archives was written, apart from
the introduction, in an unknown tongue. This letter, written by
Tushratta, king of Mitanni, dealt in its six hundred lines with some
matters interpreted with the help of other letters, and the language
was deciphered. At first it was called Mitannian, but later changed
to Subarean.
Then in the state archives of Boghazkeui in eastern Anatolia
letters were found in a similar tongue, and its name was given as
Khri. The people who spoke this language were called Khr.
Scholars read the word differently - Khar and Khur but finally they
decided on Khur as the acceptable name, and accordingly the
people are called Hurrians or Hurrites.
Despite the fact that the language of this people was found to
have been put into writing, the identification of the Hurrians with
the biblical Horites or troglodytes was maintained by a number of
scholars.2
A definite vestige of the association of the Hurrians with
Palestine has been discovered: on tablets from Tell Taannek, in the
valley of Jezreel, Hurrian names were found.
With every new discovery it became increasingly obvious that
the Hurrians exercised great influence on the civilization of the
Near East. It was even stated that with the arrival of the Hurrians in
this part of the world a new era in civilization had dawned. 3 In a
sense they became the leading power, and "the story of their
enormous expanse, from Armenia down to southern Palestine, and
from the shores of the Mediterranean up to the borders of Persia,
constitutes one of the most amazing chapters in the ancient history
of the Near East."4



The language of this people has been studied by linguists in an
endeavor to unriddle it,5 but the historians know nothing of their
history. "Hurrian" seemed therefore to be a tongue without a
people. Those who spoke it were not Semitic, but neither were they
Indo- Iranian.6
Then the writings in alphabetic Khar of Ras Shamra came to
light. Translations from other languages into Khar prcvad that at
least a part of the population used Khar as their daily speech. Who,
then, were these Khar that impressed their name on Syria, their
tongue on Asia Minor and on Mitanni, occupied a fortress in Pales
tine, were everywhere and nowhere in particular, were neither
Semitic nor Indo-Iranian?
It became apparent not only that Khar was expressible in writing,
but that the scribes who wrote in Khar were versed in a number of
other languages as well, and wore themselves out in lexicographic
study ("several rooms" in the library of Nikmed "contained only
dictionaries and lexicons"7 ). Consequently the idea that the Khar
were cave dwellers or troglodytes (the biblical Hoxites ) appears
wholly untenable.
Most probably the Hurrian people is but a creation of modern
linguists. If we bring the scene five to six hundred years closer to
our time we begin to wonder whether the Khar of the inscriptions
are not the Carians often mentioned in classic literature. In
Egyptian the Mediterranean Sea was called the Sea of Khar(u).
Was it the sea of troglodytes or the sea of the Carians?
The Carians lived on the shore of the eastern Mediterranean and
had settlements in many other parts of the world. They have left
their traces in geographical names containing the syllable "car" or
"cart" or "keret."8 In very early times - that of the semi-legendary
King Minos of Crete - they manned his fleet. Herodotus says that at
this time they were islanders and served as crews on the ships of
Minos. "Minos had subdued much territory to himself and was
victorious in war," and "this made the Carians too at that time to be
very far the most regarded of all nations."9



"Then a long time afterwards, the Carians were driven from the
islands by Dorians and Ionians and so came to the mainland:10
The mainland meant here is the southwestern corner of Asia Minor,
where Halicarnassus, the native town of Herodotus, was situated.
Thucydides ascribed to King Minos the expulsion of the Carians:
"Minos is the earliest of all those known to us by tradition who
acquired a navy. . . . [Hel became lord of the Cyclades islands and
first colonizer of most of them, driving out the Carians and
establishing his own sons in them as governors."11
The Carians are described by Thucydides as dispersed on many
islands and engaging with the Phoenicians in piracy: "still more
addicted to piracy were the islanders. These included Carians as
well as Phoenicians, for Carians inhabited most of the islands." The
close relations existing between the Carians and the Phoenicians
are further attested to by the names of towns like Phoinix and
Phoinilcus in Caria.12
Knowledge of the whereabouts of Carian colonies outside south
west Asia Minor and the trails of Carian wandering was early lost to
history. In the first century Strabo" wrote: "The emigrations of the
Carians . . . are not likewise matters of off-hand knowledge to
everybody."14
Cyprus was apparently included in "most of the islands," and the
Carians survived there till a late date. Herodotus (V, 111) mentions
a Carian shield-bearer on Cyprus in the early Persian days.
It does not require much ingenuity to come to the conclusion
that the Khar of Ras Shamra were Carians.
The Carians settled not only in Cyprus but also on the shore of
the mainland opposite, and similar graves in eastern Cyprus and in
Ras Shamra are evidence of this. The peculiarity of the Carian
graves was stressed by the early historian Thucydides, who wrote
that Carians had inhabited most of the islands "as may be inferred
from the fact that, when Delos was purified by the Athenians in this
war [ - 426] and the graves of all who had ever died on the island
were removed, over half were discovered to be Carians, being



recognized by the fashion of the armour found buried with them,
and by the mode of burial, which is that still in use among them."15
Modern archaeologists again point out the peculiar features of
the graves of Ras Shamra and of eastern Cyprus.
Inasmuch as the Carians were inhabitants of northern Syria early
in the first millennium before this era, it is only reasonable to look
for a mention of them in the Scriptures. In the eighth century
Athaliah - daughter of Ahab and daughter-in-law of King
Jehoshaphat of Jerusalem - the queen-mother who usurped the
throne when her son Ahaziah was killed by Jehu on the road to
Megiddo, had a bodyguard composed of "Carl." This bodyguard
later participated in a revolt against Athaliah, when Jehoiada, the
priest, made a covenant with "the rulers over hundreds, with the
Cari, and the runners" (II Kings 11:4,19 )16 and brought before
them Jehoash, the boy who was secretly saved when Athaliah
killed the royal family.
It is more than probable that the Kreti of the "Kreti and Pleti"
(Cherethites and Pelethites ) bodyguard of David (II Samuel 8:18),
led by his marshal Benaiah, were the same Kari. In one place in
the Scriptures (II Samuel 20:23) it is said that Benaiah was in
command of Kari (or Kre ) and Pleti. The Philistines, since days of
old, have been considered the Kreti-Pleti. The word "Pleti" is
generally regarded as a shortened form of "Philistines," and without
sufficient ground they have been presumed to be the same people
as the Kreti, and thus originated the theory that the Philistines
came from Crete.17 Pleti cannot be identical with Kreti or Kari,
because whenever they are mentioned the two names are always
connected by "and.18
The origin of the Kreti in Crete - heard even in the name - is also
attested to by the Version of the Seventy, who translated "Kreti" by
"Cretans." The Carians came from Crete. The Kreti also came from
Crete and were identical with the Kari. It is obvious that Carians
and Kari and Kreti were the same.



The Carians, royal bodyguard in the Jerusalem of Queen
Athaliah, were employed in the same capacity in the Egypt of the
seventh century, after they had arrived there together with the
Ionians, driven by a gale.19 The Carians occupied this position
until Cambyses conquered Egypt.20 They also formed the
bodyguard of the kings of Lydia in the sixth century.
In this connection it is interesting to correlate Herodotus'
statement (I, 171ff.) that the Carians invented and produced arms
and were imitated by the Greeks with the fact that "in no other site
in Syria or Palestine was found such a large quantity of arms as in
Ras Shamra"21 and with the Targum's translation of Kreti as
bowmen.
At the end of the seventh century and the beginning of the sixth
Zephaniah (2:5) and Ezekiel (25:16) prophesied the end to come
to the maritime shore of Keret.
When shortly thereafter Nebuchadnezzar subdued Tyre, the
Phoenicians and the Carians fled to Carthage, and after that this
colony grew to a metropolis.

exterminated by the Edomites; it is also possible that there is some connection with the
Hunians."

sources de l'histoire primitive du Mexique dans les monuments egyptiens (Paris, 1884).
Names such as Karkar or Carchemish (written also Gargemish) and the word "Ka? in
names of cities, like Car Shalmaneser, may be mentioned in this connection.

16 The King James version has "the Captains and the Guard?'
17 The Philistines came from the island of Caphtor (Deuteronomy 2:23; Amos 9:7;
Jeremiah 47:4). Jeremiah speaks of the 'Philistines, the remnants of the country of
Caphtor." By identifying the Philistines with Kreti and Pleti, Caphtor was identified as Crete.
It will be more in accord with historical evidence if we understand Caphtor to be Cyprus. If
Caphtor was not Cyprus, then no name for Cyprus and no mention of the island would be
found in the Scriptures, and that would be unlikely because Cyprus is very close to Syria.
The islands of Khitiim (Jeremiah Jeremiah 2:10; Ezekiel 27:6), usually identified as Cyprus,
signified all the islanand coastlands of the west, Macedonia, and even Italy. Cf. article
"Cyprus" in The Jewish Encyclopedia.
18 The word "Pleti" was given still another explanation. The Targum translated "Kreti" as
"bowmen," and "Pleti" as "slingers" from the word palet, "to cast" or "cast out." The same
verb could be regarded as meaning "those who were cast" out by the sea, or "remnants of
people escaped from some place oil the sea": iam polat is "the sea threw out."

The Carian Language
With the Ras Shamra tablets before the linguists, it would seem that
the scholarly world is at last closer to the solution of the question,
What was the language of the Carians? than was Strabo, who
discussed it nineteen centuries ago.1
Homer, in his enumeration of the allies of Troy, included "the
barbarously speaking Carians." Apollodorus understood these



words as an allusion to the fact that the Carians spoke, not Greek,
but some strange language.2 Strabo concluded from Homer's
reference that the Carians spoke Greek but pronounced it like
barbarians. Strabo probably had in mind the Carians of Asia
Minor, about whom
Herodotus wrote that, with the settlement of the Carians there,
the speech of the Caunians, the previous inhabitants, "has grown
like to the Carians', or the Carians' to theirs."3
That the Carians used a speech not understandable to the
Greeks is obvious from a story of Herodotus.4 He narrates how a
Carian came to a temple to hear the oracle; the Thebans stood
amazed to hear the oracle use a language other than Greek. The
stranger said that the words of the oracle were Carian, and he
wrote them down.
The Carians used Greek too; Herodotus tells us that the
Egyptians learned Greek from the Carians and Ionians who came
to Egypt in the days of Psammetich in the seventh century.
A scattering of Carian words is found in the classic authors; also
a few Carian personal names are preserved.5 In Egypt, on various
monuments, together with Greek autographs were found
autographs not in Greek; they were written in Greek letters with the
addition of a number of different characters so as to conform to the
phonetics of the tongue. The conclusion was drawn that these were
the names Carian mercenaries signed next to those of their Ionian
comrades-in-arms.6 The time was the seventh century. A number
of epitaphs, some bilingual - in Carian and in Egyptian - were also
discovered, but as the texts were apparently not exact translations
from one language into the other, attempts to decipher the Carian
have remained quite indecisive. The hypothesis that the language
was Indo-German was disputed and rejected.7 Neither is it Semitic.
The same diagnosis - that it is neither Indo-German nor Semitic
is made for the Hurrian (Khar) language of Mesopotamia. In both
cases the characters, of the Khar and of the Carian inscriptions, are
foreign to the language - in the one case they are borrowed from



cuneiform, in the other from the Greek alphabet. It is of interest
that a Mitanni element was discerned in Carian.8 The Carian has
not yet been read. In the summer of 1935 numerous Carian
inscriptions were discovered near Mylasa in Caria (by Benveniste ),
but they have not yet been published. For reasons explained
previously, it seems to me that it would be profitable to investigate
the Khar of Ras Shamra, proceeding on the basis that it is the
Carian language but in other characters, and to decipher Carian
inscriptions with the help of the tablets of Ras Shamra.
The theory that the Ras Shamra tablets contain references to
Ionians should not have been rejected; Ionians might have been
mentioned in them, for it was not the fourteenth but the ninth
century. It seems to me also permissible to conjecture that the word
read as Ugarit9 is the Carian-Ionian name of Euagoras. Kings of
that name ruled on Cyprus, and the reign of one Euagoras in the
fifth century before this era and of another early in the fourth
century are known from Greek and Latin authors. The war of the
second Euagoras against the Persians is mentioned in a later
chapter of the present work. The influence of Cyprus on Ras
Shamra was emphasized by the excavators; it is thought that in an
early period this site on the Syrian shore might have been a colony
of Cyprian rulers. This observation corroborates the surmise that
an early king of Cyprus, a descendant of Carian who were driven
to the east by the Ionians, built a city on the Syrian shore opposite
the island of Cyprus on the ruins of a previous city and called it by
his own name, Euagoras.
The name of the king Nikmedes (also written Nilcmes, Nikmed)
is the Ionian-Carian name Nikomedes. A similar name,
Nikodamos, may have been a form more agreeable to a Semitic
ear.10
The city of Didyma, whence came the Ionians to Ugarit, was in
Ionia, but its name is Carian.11 Tablets of the ninth century B.C.
could contain this name, but not tablets of the fifteenth century.



It is curious, indeed, that the scholar who insisted that Ionians
are referred to in the Ras Shamra texts, nevertheless conservatively
maintained that the Khar of Ras Shamra, mentioned together with
the Ionians, were the Horites (troglodytes) of the Bible.12 Carians
and Ionians, not only in the Ras Shamra text, but in many texts of
Greek authors, are mentioned together. Despite the fact that at an
early date the Carians were driven from Crete and the Cyclades by
the Greeks (Ionians), the two people intermingled, and the story of
their first appearance together on the Egyptian shore shows that
they became partners in their enterprises. In the classic literature
the Carians usually appear either with the Ionians or with the
Phoenicians.
If one day an Orphic hymn should be found in the dust of Ras
Shamra it would be a lucky day for the excavators but no miracle.
According to Homer, the Carians participated in the defense of
Troy. They might have had their own reminiscences and their own
poems in which they sang the battles of Ilion. It is known that on
Cyprus poems were composed dealing with the same subject as the
Iliad,13 but, except for twenty-five short fragments, nothing remains
of them. Were these poems orginally written in Carian?
The early relations between the Carians and Crete and between
Crete and Cyprus should be remembered now that the Khar
language of Ras Shamra is being read. Then a new attempt should
be made to interpret the still unread characters of the Cyprian
inscriptions, the linear script of Crete, and the pictorial script of that
island, and thus to lift the veil that conceals the past of Crete and of
the Minoan culture, the maritime adventures of the Carians in the
second millennium, perhaps even the story of Atlantis.

Amenhotep II
Syria-Palestine of the period we are discussing was a region
coveted by the pharaohs and striving for independence.
When the long and successful reign of Thutmose III came to its
end, Amenhotep II (his royal name is usually read Okheperure)
took the scepter. To the Asiatic provinces the death of Thutmose III
was a signal for insurrection and the casting off of the Egyptian
yoke. Amenhotep II marched at the head of a vast army of
chariots, horsemen, and foot warriors to suppress the rebellion in
Syria and Palestine. His Majesty "went against Retenu [Palestine] in
his first victorious campaign, in order to extend his frontier. . . . His
Majesty came to Shamash-Edom and devastated it. . . . His
Majesty came to Ugarit and subdued all his adversaries. . . ."1



On the way to Syria Amenhotep II displayed his ability to use the
bow in a demonstration before the local princes in order to impress
and intimidate them.
He returned to Memphis with a few hundred nobles as war
prisoners and a booty of some hundred horses and chariots or war
carriages. On his return to Egypt he hanged some of the prisoners
to the mast of his ship on the Nile with their heads down.
In his ninth year he repeated his expedition to Palestine, his goal
being Aphek in lower Galilee. He plundered two villages "west of
Socoh,"'and after pillaging other unimportant localities, he returned
to Memphis with more prisoners. His harassing visits made him a
common enemy of the kingdoms of Palestine and Syria. When he
came again to Palestine, the main, and seemingly the only, battle
was fought at a place called y-r'-s-t. Various solutions have been
proposed for the identification of this locality.2 However, it is an
important fact that according to Amenhotep's annals he reached
the place one day after his army left the Egyptian border 3 Thus the
place of the battle could have been only in southern Palestine.
Amenhotep called himself victorious, and it is accepted that this
campaign was a victorious one. But was it really? What was the
booty in the battle of y-r'-s-t?
List of that which his majesty captured on this day: his horses 2, chariots 1, a coat of
mail, 2 bows, a quiver full of arrows, a corselet and-4
some object the reading of which is no longer possible. But
what-ever may have been that last object, the complete spoils were
pitiful indeed if all the king of Egypt could count after his victorious
battle were one chariot, two horses, two bows, and one quiver "full
of arrows." It was a defeat.5
After a victory an army usually marches deeper into the enemy's
territory. But the lines directly following the enumeration of the
spoils say that, "passing southward toward Egypt, his majesty
proceeded by horse."6 Immediately after the battle, the king turned
toward Egypt.



When a king returns from a successful campaign of restoring
order in the provinces, the cities located on his triumphal route
home do not choose that moment for revolt. Vassal cities rebel on
seeing their oppressor in flight, and this is just what happened, for
the war annals relate that Asiatics of a city on the way to Egypt
"plotted to make a plan for casting out the infantry of his majesty."7
During the remainder of his reign, for some decades, Amen
hotep II did not return to Palestine, and there is no mention of any
yearly tribute from there.8
To ascertain whether his expedition was a defeat, his subjective
evaluation of the campaign must be compared with the scriptural
record.
The son of Rehoboam, Abijah, king of Judah, succeeded in
winning a decisive battle against Jeroboam, king of Israel (II
Chronicles 13). This must mean that Egyptian domination was
already declining.
After the short reign of Abijah, Asa, his son, followed him. "In his
days the land was quiet ten years." He built fortified cities in Judah,
constructed walls and towers, gates and bars. He said to Judah:
"We have sought the Lord our God, and he hath given us rest on
every side" (II Chronicles 14:7). So they built and prospered.
The destruction of the images of the pagan gods was in itself a
rebellion (II Chronicles 14:5), for among them the first place surely
belonged to the Egyptian gods, as the land since Shishak (
Thutmose III) had been subject to the Egyptian crown. By fortifying
the cities of Judah and recruiting his warriors, Asa dearly rejected
Egyptian rule.
II CHRONICLES 14:8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears,
out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and
drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.
The cities were fortified, the army stood ready.
II CHRONICLES 14:9-10 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian
with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto
Mareshah.



Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of
Zephathah at Mareshah.
Asa prayed to God for help.
II CHRONICLES 14:12-13 So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Ma, and before
Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar; and the
Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were
destroyed before the Lord, and before his host; and they carried away very much
spoil.
Zerah the Ethiopian, who led an army of Ethiopians and Libyans
(II Chronicles 16:8) from the southern and western borders of
Egypt (like the army of the pharaoh Shishak), could b e none other
than a pharaoh. The way from Ethiopia to Palestine is along the
valley of the Nile, and an Ethiopian army, in order to reach
Palestine, would have had to conquer Egypt first. Moreover, the
presence of Libyan soldiers in the army leaves little doubt that the
king was the pharaoh of Egypt.
In the opinion of the exegetes ( Graf, Erbt) the story of the
Chronicles must have a historical basis in an Egyptian or an
Arabian invasion.
The description of the battle of Mareshah or Moresheth9 reveals
why the pharaoh turned his back speedily on Palestine and his face
toward Egypt, why from the field of this battle his army carried
away "one bow and two horses," and why the population of the
cities, presumably in Edomite southern Palestine, plotted against
his garrisons.
It is a token of defeat when an Egyptian king recounts his own
personal valor and fierceness on the battlefield, fighting himself
against the soldiers of the enemy. It means that, when everyone
had fled, His Majesty fought alone. In bombastic phrases, which do
not refer to any special encounter, the inscription glorifies the ruler
who battled alone: "Behold, he was like a fierce-eyed lion."
He was pursued only to Gerar. So he still had the satisfaction of
taking with him on his return to Egypt a few chiefs of some villages,



whom he burned alive in Egypt: his Memphis stele records this
holocaust.
Amenhotep II was not a great man, but he was a large one. He
was proud of his physical strength and boasted that no one could
draw his bow. A large bow inscribed with his name was found a
few decades ago in his sepulcher.
"There is not one who can draw his bow among his army,
among the hill-country sheiks [or] among the princes of Retenu
[Palestine] because his strength is so much greater than [that of]
any king who has ever existed," says the Elephantine stele.10
"It is his story which furnished Herodotus with the legend that
Cambyses was unable to draw the bow of the king of Ethiopia.11 A
modern scholar saw a common origin in this story, which survived
in legendary form in Herodotus (Book , 21ff. ), and in the historical
boast written on the stele of Elephantine by Amenhotep II,who
lived many centuries earlier. The story of Herodotus has an
Ethiopian king as the bragging bender of the bow of Amenhotep II.
Was Amenhotep II an Ethiopian on the Egyptian throne?
In the veins of the Theban Dynasty there was Ethiopian blood'12
Was the royal wife of Thutmose III a full-blooded Ethiopian and
did she bear him a dark-skinned son? Or was Amenhotep II not the
son of Thutmose III at all? He called himself son of 'Thutmose, but
this claim need not have been literally true. He called his mother
Hatshepsut.13 Is it possible that before ascending the throne of
Egypt he was a viceroy in Ethiopia14 Conventional chronology
identifying Zerah with Osorkon of the Libyan Dynasty encounters
difficulty in the biblical reference to Zerah as an Ethiopian.
It was a glorious accomplishment to carry away so decisive a
victory from the battlefield, when the foe was not a petty Arabian
prince - as some exegetes have thought15 - or a pharaoh of the
ignominious Twenty-second Dynasty - as other exegetes have
assumed - but Amenhotep II, the great pharaoh, the successor to
Thutmose III, the greatest of all the pharaohs. It was a victory as
sweeping as the defeat of the Hyksos-Amalekites by Saul, but, as



we shall see, its effect on the subsequent period was not of equal
importance.
Politically, the victory was not sufficiently exploited, but this fact
does not detract from its military value. Egypt, at the very zenith of
its imperial might, was beaten by Asa, king of Judah, and this was
not a victory over an Egyptian garrison or a detachment
dispatched to collect tribute, but over the multitude of the
Egyptian-Ethiopian and Libyan hosts, at the head of whom stood
the emperor-pharaoh himself.
With the rout of the Egyptian army in the south of Palestine, all
of Syria-Palestine naturally was freed of the Egyptian yoke. The
pharaoh had previously laid Ugarit waste and threatened all the
kingdoms in this area; it is conceivable that the king of Judah had
some help from the north, and the sympathy of the Syrian
maritime peoples must certainly have been with Asa. The
inscriptions of Amenhotep II reveal his ambition to dominate, in
addition to the land of the Nile, the lands of the Jordan, Orontes,
and Euphrates, which had rebelled after the death of Thutmose .
The great victory at Mareshah carried a message of freedom to all
these peoples; the repercussions of the battle should have been
heard in many countries and for many generations. But only once
again does the Book of Chronicles pay tribute to this victory, and
this in the words of the seer Hanani: "Were not the Ethiopians and
the Lubim [Libyans] a huge host, with very many chariots and
horsemen?" (II Chronicles 16:8.) It is also said that the population
of the northern tribes went over to Judah because of the high
esteem this country enjoyed after it had successfully repelled the
pharaoh and his army (II Chronicles 15:9). Is no more material
concerning the victory of Ma over Amenhotep II preserved? Such a
great triumph should have had a greater echo.
It had this echo. A Phoenician poem sings of that victory over
the host of Amenhotep II.

2 Brugsch read the name "Arinath" and identified it with Orontes. Breasted and others
accepted this view; F. W. von Bissing objected (Die Statistische Tafel von Karnak [Leipzig,
1897], p. 34); Petrie read "Arseth" and surmised it to be Haroshet on the Kishon (History of
Egypt, II, 155). J. A. Wilson, however, verified the reading y-r-s-t on the Karnak fragment.
3 Amenhotep II started his campaign, according to the Memphis Stele, on the "First month
of the third season, day 25." He reached y-r-s-t on the "first month of the third season, day
26" (Karnak variant), or only one day later. See "Egyptian Historical Texts" by J. A. Wilson

Menelik, Icing of Ethiopia and son of the Queen of the South, guest of Solomon, returned
to Palestine to rob its Temple; after succeeding in stealing the holy Ark by a ruse, he fled to
Ethiopia, pursued by Solomon, his father, to the borders of Egypt. Two historical elements
are mingled in this legend. The sack of the Temple was the work of Shishak-Thutmose III,
the successor of Queen Sheba-Hatshepsut. The one who fled from Palestine, pursued by
the king of Jerusalem, was Zerah-Amenhotep II, the successor of Shishak-Thutmose M.

The Poem of Keret



Among the epics unearthed at Ras Shamra, one contains some
historical material. The poem of Keret - the archaeologists call it by
the name of its hero - has a historical setting. It was first translated
and interpreted by Charles Virolleaud.1 Later a very different
meaning was given to the text. Virolleaud read in the text of the
danger threatening the country of Keret, king of Sidon. The
invasion of Negeb (south of Palestine) by the army of Terah
aroused Keref s fears; he wept in the seclusion of his chamber. In
his great distress he was encouraged by a voice heard in a dream,
and he went to meet the danger and joined the army of the
defenders.
The names of Asher and Zebulun, two tribes, appear according
to Virolleaud, in the poem. It is not clear from the poem whether
the role of the tribe of Zebulun was that of an enemy or a friend.
Asher is mentioned repeatedly in a refrain, and the poem gives a
vivid feeling of armed tribesmen hurrying to join the main army
opposing Terah.
Asher, two and two are gone, Asher, three and three are gone, shut the houses,
marched together.
Volunteers joined the thousands of Hasis.
Men of Hasis went by thousands, and by myriads, as a flood [yr].
They marched to meet the army of Terah. And Terah came into
Negeb with a great force: "a great force of three hundred times ten
thousand [rbt]," which would mean - if the translation is correct
three million men. Then the poem tells that the huge invading
army, having been defeated, was in full retreat.
Who was Terah? asked Virolleaud. In Genesis the father of
Abraham is called Terah. The theory was advanced2 and found
followers in France that patriarchal migrations and wars are
described in the Phoenician poem of Keret. It was found to be a
very illuminating addition to the legends about the sojourn and
wandering of the patriarchs in Negeb - southern Palestine - as
found in Genesis.



The patriarch Abraham came to Negeb; so did Terah of the
poem. In the Scriptures it is said that Terah, Abraham's father,
migrated from Ur of the Chaldees on the lower flow of the
Euphrates to Harran in the northwest, and ended his days there (
Genesis 11:32).
A correction was introduced with the help of the poem, and it
was agreed that Terah did not die in Harran but prepared the
conquest of Canaan from the south and also accomplished it in
part, and that Abraham capitulated when he met difficulties and
left Canaan to seek refuge in Egypt.3 Abraham and his two
brothers, sons of the scriptural Terah, are not mentioned in the
poem, and it was conjectured that this was because of the leading
role played by Terah and the inconspicuous role of Abraham, the
latter becoming an anonym in the multitude of the Terahites. And if
the tale is very different from the scriptural legend, still the
combination - Negeb, the scene, and Terah, the invader - seemed
to be a convincing parallel to Negeb, the scene, and Abraham, son
of Terah, the invader. Consequently, the conclusion was drawn by
Virolleaud. that Terahites invaded the south of Canaan, meeting
resistance on the part of the population, although in the Scriptures
nothing is said about Abraham's war with the Canaanites, and in
fact the peacefulness of his sojourn there is stressed.
An unexplained unconformity is the huge number of soldiers in
the host of Terah: three hundred times ten thousand is very
different from the number of persons in Abraham's household,
servants included. The occurrence of the names Asher and
Zebulun also presented a difficulty. Asher and Zebulun were sons of
Israel of the Scriptures; these tribes were descendants of Abraham,
son of Terah. How could Terah have battled with children of Asher
and Zebulun, his descendants of many generations?
To meet this situation it was said that originally the names of
Asher and Zebulun belonged to cantons inhabited by Canaanites.
At a later date these places were conquered by the tribes of Israel,
who did not give their names to, but received their names from, the
cantons.4



Another translation and interpretation of the poem of Keret was
presented. It rejects Terah, Asher, Zebulun, as proper names,
finding for them the meanings: bridegroom (terah), after, behind
(atur), sick man (zebulun).5 It also denies the predominant martial
theme of the poem, regarding it as a love romance. Thus are
explained away the names of tribes not to be expected in Ugaritic
times. Numerous other changes and corrections were offered.
It seems to us, however, that Virolleaud's translation was not far
from the truth. Terah of the poem was, indeed, not the father of the
patriarch, but the names of the tribes and the martial plot appear to
be consistent With history.
It is, in fact, undisputed that Ugarit and the entire Phoenician
coast were threatened by Amenhotep II in the period with which
we are concerned.
Free from the limitations imposed by an incorrect estimate of the
age of the Ras Shamra tablets, we pose this question: Is an
unsuccessful invasion of southern Palestine by a large host known
to us from the Scriptures?
Such an invasion occurred in the days of Asa, king of Judah,
and it was headed by Zerah the Ethiopian. In the Second Book of
Chronicles the invading army under Zerah is called a very large
multitude, "thousand thousand," or a million.
II CHRONICLES 14:9 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with a
host of a thousand thousand. . . .
We have already recognized Zerah the Ethiopian as King
Amenhotep II, and compared the scriptural and the Egyptian
material.
We shall compare a few data from the Phoenician poem and
from the inscriptions of Amenhotep II and from the Scriptures. If
we again find parallels, obviously we shall strengthen the
identification of Zerah as Amenhotep II.
In the Phoenician poem the army of Terah is described in these
words:



A great force of 300 times 10,000 [rbt] with harpes [hepes] of copper, with daggers
[snn] of bronze.
It was noted that the poem used for copper scimitars the
Egyptian word hepes, and for the daggers of bronze, the Egyptian
word snn.
In the tomb of Amenken,7 King Amenhotep II is portrayed
inspecting gifts to be distributed among his officers; these are
swords described with the words "360 bronze hps [hepes]", and
next to these swords are pictured one hundred and forty daggers.
Inasmuch as the Egyptian name is given to the weapons in the
Phoenician poem, their Egyptian origin would not be an arbitrary
conclusion. The weapons are designated in the Phoenician poem
by the word used on the Egyptian monument depicting Pharaoh
Amenhotep II with weapons for his army. Accordingly, the forces of
Terah were armed with weapons identical with those with which
Amenhotep armed his soldiers. Examples of harpes (scimitars)
have been found in Gezer in southern Palestine8
The extant fragments of the poem describe the armies rushing to
the battle. We see Keret marching across fields on which he finds
arms thrown away by the fleeing soldiers of a beaten army; he
comes to a spring tinged with blood.9 He marches toward the cities
of Edom with the intention of sharing in the loot.
According to the Scriptures, after the battle of Maresha.h (
Moresheth-gath) the Judean victors looted the cities of the south: . .
. the people . . . pursued them unto Gerar. . . . And they smote all
the cities round about Gerar . . . and they spoiled all the cities; for
there was exceedingly much spoil in them" (II Chronicles 14: 13-14
).
In the poem the march to the south to loot the cities after the
victory is told in these words by the poet to Keret:
Go a day and two days
A third one and a fourth one,
A fifth one and a sixth one,
And on the seventh day you will meet Sapasites.



And you shall come to Edom Rabbim
And to Edom Serirot,
The poem is in the rhythm of the marching step of the hero and
his men.
Then he met the Sapasites
And went to Edom Rabbot
And to Edom Serirot.
The king of Edom begged Keret:
Don't combat Edom Rabbot
Nor Edom Serirot,
Depart, king of Sidon,
0, Keret, from my parvisl10
And Keret asked from him his daughter instead of booty: she is
"beautiful as Astarte."
We are intrigued to know whether Keret brought the daughter of
the king of the Edomite city to Sidon as his consort, and a
subsequently found fragment of the poem tells us that he did so.
But we are more anxious to know who were the "Sapasites" before
the walls of the cities of Edom, and what the name Serirot
designates, and whether we are on the road we set ourselves to
follow.
What does "people of Sapas" mean? A partial answer is at hand:
"Sapas is the sun and the Sapasites got their name from it; Sapas
of Canaan was analogous to Shamash [sun] of the Assyrians and
Babylonians11 The people who are repeatedly named as opposing
Keret before the walls of the Edomite city were Sapas or Shamash
men.
Cities in Edom were doomed to be looted, according to the
poem and the Second Book of Chronicles, which also suggested
that this fate was imposed on them because they apparently
supported Zerah and his Ethiopian and Libyan host. We are
therefore interested to know from what base Amenhotep II
conducted his campaign against Palestine.



Amenhotep II's record of his campaign in Palestine-Syria begins
verbatim:
His majesty was in the city of Shamash Edom. His majesty furnished an example of
bravery there.
The city of Shamash Edom is nowhere mentioned in extant
Egyptian documents except in the registers of Thutmose III and in
this monumental inscription of Amenhotep IL Is it a coincidence
that, in the Phoenician poem about the invasion of Terah and his
multitude, the name of the city is Edom and the people are called
Sapas or Shamash? We have identified Terah of the poem as Zerah
of the Scriptures. We have identified Zerah of the Scriptures as
Amenhotep II. Now we find the same city with the same people as
the military base of Terah of the poem and of Amenhotep II of the
hieroglyphic annals.
Of the word "Sarira" or "Serirot" (plural) in the poem of Keret we
have an explanation in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the
Scriptures. An addition to I Kings 12:24 gives some details
concerning Jeroboam. His mother, called Zeruah in I Kings 11:26,
is referred to there as Sarira. When he was appointed by Solomon
to be over the northern part of the kingdom he built a town in
Mount Ephraim and named it Sarira. When, after the death of
Solomon, Jeroboam returned from his exile in Egypt he "came into
the land of Sarira." The tribe of Ephraim assembled there and,
according to the Septuagint, Jeroboam fortified Sarira.
Sarira was the name of a fortress built first about - 920 and
possibly of every fortress built following the plan of Jeroboam's
fortress, which he called by the name of his mother. In the days of
Keret, one generation later, the name Edom-Serirot (plural of
Sarira) is used. Half a millennium before Jeroboam, Serirot is an
anachronism.
What was the role of Keret in the allied army? In II Samuel 8:18
it is written that Kreti. and Pleti (Cherethites and Pelethites ) were
bodyguards of David. These were mercenaries in the service of the
king of Jerusalem. Some sixty years liter, in time of need, Asa



called on the Sidonians for help; they themselves were alarmed by
the invasion approaching from the south, as the first scene of the
Keret poem vividly describes.
The defeat of the invading army under Terah, the weapons
scattered over the fields, the wells stained red with blood, and the
cities of Edom trembling before the victorious warriors are vivid
pictures which fit the biblical story of the victory over Zerah and
over the Edomite cities supporting him.
Analysis of the historical background of the Keret poem reveals
that Virolleaud's translation was rejected without sufficient reason.
It is a description of a war and a rout. The mention of the tribes of
Asher and Zebulun in this setting is natural and does not call for a
philological theory that gives other meanings to these names.
These two tribes of the tribes of Israel were the closest neighbors of
Sidon. Together with the Sidonians they left their homes and
hastened to Mareshah to take part in the battle or to exploit Asa's
victory. An allusion to this co-operation of the northern tribes is
found in the Second Book of Chronicles (15:9) following the
description of Asa's victory: "they fell to him [Asa] out of Israel in
abundance, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him."
Comparing the record of the Second Book of Chronicles and the
annals of Amenhotep II, who followed Thutmose III, we found that
according to both sources a great army came from the borders of
Egypt and invaded Palestine; that it reached the place
MoreshethGath or Mu Areset, in Egyptian, one or two days'
distance from the border (nakhal mizraim); and that it was turned
back by defenders of the land. And that the domination of Egypt
over Palestine ceased and was re-established only by the successor
of Amenhotep II.
Comparing the annals of Amenhotep II with the poem of Keret,
we find in both sources that the Phoenician coast was threatened
(Ugarit is especially mentioned by Amenhotep II ); that the
invaders were armed with hepes, or copper scimitars; and that
Shamash Edom played an important role in the campaign, being



occupied first by Amenhotep II, then by Keret and his allies, who
defeated the invader.
Comparing now Chronicles and the poem of Keret, we find that,
according to the scriptural text, the army invading Negeb was
composed of three hundred chariots and "a thousand thousand" of
soldiers, and the defending army had three hundred thousand men
of Judea; according to the poem, the invading army had three
hundred times ten thousand men. At the head of the army was
Zerah or (in the Virolleaud translation) Terah. The cities in Negeb
were looted; Edom Serirot is mentioned, and has an explanation in
the Translation of the Seventy. Northern tribes of Israel joined the
army of the south in looting the cities of Negeb.
We would not attempt to derive an argument for the present
reconstruction of history and to build our conclusions on
Virolleaud's interpretation of the Keret poem, since this translation
is a matter of controversy. On the other hand, we may offer a
partial vindication of Virolleaud, and we find support for him in the
historical setting as revealed by our reconstruction.
Some twenty years after the defeat at Mareshah, Thutmose IV,
successor to Amenhotep II, re-established Egyptian hegemony over
Syria and Palestine. There are no records of the campaign, but he
bears the appellation "conqueror of Syria. 12 Thutmose IV met
very little resistance, if any. The pressure of the Assyrians from the
north made it desirable for the Syrians to submit to Egypt.13

13 As was demonstrated in a previous chapter, Shishak is the scriptural name of Thutmose.
Since the tablets of Ras Shamra belong to the period of the Amen-hoteps and Thutmoses,
we should expect to find in them, besides the biblical name of Zerah, that of Shishak. It
was, in fact, among the first of the deciphered words and It caused considerable surprise.

The excavator of Ras Shamra found that the city had been
destroyed by violence and had not been rebuilt. Buildings were
demolished; the library was burned and its walls fell on the tablets
and crushed many of them. The last king whose name is
mentioned on the documents that survived the fire is Nikmed.
There was also found a proclamation which states that the city was
captured and Nikmed and all the foreigners were expelled.
On the level of the structure destroyed by fire a seal impression
of Amenhotep was found, as well as two letters of the type of the
el-Amarna collection. Judged by these findings, Ugarit came to its
end in the later days of Amenhotep or in the early days of
Akhnaton, a time known as the el-Amarna period.



In a letter written by Abimilki, king of Tyre, and found in the state
archives of Akhet-Aton ( el-Amarna), this vassal king informed the
pharaoh of what had happened to Ugarit:
And fire has consumed Ugarit, the city of the king; half of it is consumed, and its other
half is not; and the people of the army of Hatti are not there.1
Half of Ugarit was burned, the other half was razed, and the
invaders, soldiers of Hatti, retreated after they had wrought this
destruction.
Mention of the destruction brought upon Ugarit and actual
evidence of demolition by a violent hand convinced the
investigators of Ras Shamra that the city ceased to exist in the very
days to which the letter of Abimilki referred.
In the el-Amarna letters the city of Ugarit was referred to by
name and her devastation was recorded, but the name of the king
of Ugarit was not given. It could be established only inferentially. It
is known that Nikmed lived during the el-Amarna period.2 His
name, on the latest tablets of the Ras Shamra library, and the two
tablets of the el-Amarna type, bore evidence that the catastrophe of
fire and destruction, as described by the king of Tyre and as found
by the excavators, occurred in the days of Nikmed, in the period of
el-Amarna.3
The proclamation found in Ras Shamra is directly related to the
upheaval in the life of the city. Some invading king decreed that
"the Jaman [Ionians], the people of Didyme, the Khar [Carians],
the Cypriotes, all foreigners, together with the king Nikmed" were
to be expelled from Ugarit, "all those who pillage you, all those
who oppress you, all those who ruin you."4 It appears that the
proclamation was addressed to the Phoenician section of the city's
population; it was written in ancient Hebrew with cuneiform
characters.
The opening portion of the proclamation is missing; this is
regrettable5 because it might have revealed the name of the king
who expelled Nikmed. Who was the king who conquered Ugarit,



burned it, expelled its population, and caused King Nikmed to flee?
He will be identified in Chapter V.
Was Nikmed, his city burned, his fleet dispersed, a forerunner of
the coming migration to Africa, where about the middle of the
ninth century Phoenician refugees founded Carthage, or Keret the
New,6 in present-day Tunisia? Or did he direct his sails to Hellas,
with which Ugarit traded in Mycenaean ware? Ugarit was also a
market for the Ionians, who had their own colony there; they fled
with Nikmed.
I believe Nikmed was not lost in the history of that century, so
rich in events. I intend to trace his place of refuge later on.

Retarded Echoes
Three of the main conclusions of this chapter are:
1. The timetables of Crete (Minoan ages) and of early Greece (
Mycenaean ages) are displaced by the same stretch of time by
which Egyptian dates are out of step with the revised chronology;
2. Biblical criticism that ascribed the origin of many biblical texts to
late centuries and to foreign influences is as erroneous on this issue
as the reversal of it that assumes a borrowing of many biblical texts
and institutions from the Canaanites of the fourteenth century;



3. The Hurrian language is but Carian; there existed no Hurrian
nation.
We learned also that Amenhotep II is the scriptural Zerah, and
that he lost the domination of Palestine and Syria in a battle at
Mareshah; that the Keret poem actually refers to the harassing of
Ugarit by Amenhotep II; and that Ugarit was laid waste in the ninth
century.
The excavators and interpreters found themselves compelled to
draw a number of inferences about the historical reappearance of
one or another earlier cultural achievement. The sepulchral
chambers of Ugarit influenced the architecture of sepulchral
chambers on Cyprus - but not until more than half a millennium
had elapsed. The naval catalogue of Ugarit reappeared in the epic
creations of Homer after an interlude of several centuries. Jewels
identical with those of Ugarit were worn by maidens of Jerusalem
six or seven hundred years after the destruction of Ugarit. The
poetic style and meter, the legal ordinances and sacerdotal
practices, even the system of weights, re-emerged after an equally
long period. Dividing strokes between written words were
introduced into the script of Cyprus some seven hundred years
after the script of Ras Shamra with the same characteristics had
fallen into oblivion.
In western Asia Minor, where Homer lived, in the Jerusalem of
the prophets, on Cyprus, all around Ugarit, the echo of its culture,
its language, and its art returned only after a long period of latency.
Retarded echoes are never heard in Egypt; and how could it be
otherwise? For the chronology of Ugarit-Ras Shamra is constructed
to synchronize with the chronology of Egypt.



Chapter VI
THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS
The el-Amarna Letters and When They Were Written
A FEW small villages are scattered in the valley by the bank of the
Nile where once stood Akhet-Aton, "the place where Aton rises."
The site bears a name artificially composed by modern
archaeologists, Tell el-Amarna. Ruins of temples, palaces, tombs,
private dwellings, and workshops of craftsmen have been cleared
of the desert sand that buried them for thousands of years.
In 1887 state archives were unearthed at Tell el-Amarna. A fellah
woman digging in her yard turned up some clay tablets with
cuneiform signs; the story runs that she sold her find for the
equivalent of two shillings. Samples sent to the Louvre Museum
were pronounced forgeries, but soon the scientific world recognized
their genuineness.
During the ensuing years a hunt for the clay slabs was
undertaken by many archaeologists on behalf of public and private
collections. Meanwhile, the tablets had been scattered by
unlicensed diggers and dealers in antiquities. Many were damaged,
some broken into pieces by unskilled excavation, in the course of
transportation, and, it is said, by partition among the clandestine
excavators.
Up to the present over three hundred and sixty tablets have been
recovered. With the exception of a few single tablets found in
Palestine and in Syria, which obviously belong to the same
collection, the entire lot is thought to have been found in or near
the place recognized as the state archives of Akhet-Aton. Only a
few tablets contain fragments of epic poems; all the others are



letters exchanged between two successive Icings of Egypt and their
cor-respondents, the free kings of territories in the Middle East and
Cyprus and various vassal kings and princes or officers in Syria and
Palestine.
The kings in the north were not subject to the kings of Egypt,
and they wrote "to my brother" and signed themselves "thy
brother." The kings in Canaan and Syria, however, were under the
scepter of the Nile dynasty and wrote "to my king, my lord" and
signed themselves "thy servant." There are also letters addressed to
certain dignitaries of the Egyptian court. Letters written by the
pharaohs or in their names were obviously copies stored in the
archives in order to preserve a record. The language of the tablets,
with few exceptions, is Assyro-Babylonian (Akkadian), with many
words in a Syrian dialect similar to Hebrew.1
The city of Akhet-Aton was built by the schismatic king
Amenhotep IV, who abolished the cult of Amon of Thebes and
introduced the cult of Aton, interpreted as the solar disk, and who
changed his name to Akhnaton. But shortly after his reign the
capital city of Akhet-Aton was abandoned, his religion was
stamped as heresy, and his images were mutilated. His son-in-law,
the young pharaoh Tutankhamen, reigned briefly in the old capital,
Thebes. Then the dynasty became extinct. Akhet-Aton had a short
history of only about twenty-five years before it was deserted by its
inhabitants.
The time of the letters can be established with some precision.
They were addressed to Nimmuria (Ni-ib-mu'-wa-ri-ia, Mi-im-muri
ia, Im-mu-ri-ia), who was Amenhotep, and to Naphuria (Naap-hu
ru-ri-ia, Nam-hur-ia), who was Amenhotep IV (Akhnaton). The
letters sent to Amenhotep were presumably brought to Akhet-Aton
from the archives at Thebes.
Long rows of shelves are filled with books and treatises dealing
with these letters, which until recently were the most ancient
exchange of state letters preserved. The science of history, it is
thought, is in possession of historical testimony on a period



previous to the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan. One of the
main objects of investigation was to identify places and peoples
named in the letters.
In the tablets written by the vassal king of Jerusalem (Urusalim )
to the pharaoh, repeated mention is made of the "Habiru," who
threatened the land from east of the Jordan. In letters written from
other places, there is no reference to Habiru, but an invasion of sa
gaz-Mesh (sa-gaz is also read ideographically habatu and trans
lated "cutthroats," "pillagers") is mentioned over and over again.
With the help of various letters it has been established that Habiru
and sa-gaz (habatu) were identical. In letters from Syria the
approach of the king of Hatti to the slopes of the mountains of
Lebanon was reported with terror.
The impression received is that these invasions - of Habiru from
the east and of the king of Hatti from the north - menaced
Egyptian domination of Syria, a domination which, it was learned,
actually ceased shortly after the reign of Akhnaton. In their letters
the vassals incessantly ask for help against the invaders and often
also against one another. King Akhnaton, "the first monotheist in
world history,"2 did not care for his empire; he was immersed in his
dream of "a religion of love." Little or no help was sent; the mastery
of the pharaohs over Syria and Canaan was broken, and the
control of Egypt over her Asiatic tributary provinces was swept
away.
The name "king of Hatti" is generally understood as "king of the
Hittites." In a later period - that of Seti I and Ramses II of the
Nineteenth Dynasty - there were great wars between the kings of
Hatti and the pharaohs. In a chapter dealing with that period the
history of the "forgotten empire of the Hittites" will be analyzed.
"The king of Hatti" of the el-Amarna period is supposed to have
been one of the kings of that "forgotten empire."
The name Habiru, mentioned in the letters of the king of
Jerusalem, became an important issue and gave rise to the
following conjecture: these invaders could have been the Hebrews



under Joshua drawing near to the borders of Canaan. The Habiru,
too, emerged from the desert and approached the land from the
other side of
the Jordan. Arriving at the Promised Land during the time of
Amenhotep and Akhnaton, they were supposed to have left Egypt
sometime in the days of Thutmose III or AmenhotepII.
This does not seem to be a well-founded construction, because
these monarchs were conquerors and despots, too strong to allow
the Israelites to put off the yoke of bondage. Other scholars have
refused to identify the Israelites with the Habiru because the
Hebrews were thought still to have been in Egypt at the time of
Akhnaton, and the sole opportunity they would have had to leave
would have been during a period of anarchy, when the once
powerful dynasty was dying down, or during the interregnum
following the extinction of that dynasty: these would have been the
only times suitable for the rebellion of the slaves and their
departure. In that view the Habiru came in one of the waves of
nomads eager to settle in the land of Canaan; other waves must
have followed, one of them being the Israelites under Joshua ben
Nun.
In the introductory chapter of this book I dwelt on the various
theories relative to the time of the Exodus. There it was explained
that a large group of scholars cannot compromise even on an
Exodus at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, but have chosen
Ramses II of the Nineteenth Dynasty to be the Pharaoh of the
Exodus, holding the Exodus to be an insignificant event in the
history of Egypt; or they select Ramses to be the Pharaoh of
Oppression and his son Merneptah the Pharaoh of the Exodus.
As the el-Amarna tablets, in the opinion of these scholars, pre
ceded the Exodus, the Habiru could not possibly have been the
Israelites. Another link was sought to connect the narrative of the
Scriptures with the details unfolded in the letters. A parallel to
Joseph was found in the Egyptian courtier of Semitic name and
obviously Semitic origin, Dudu,3 whose memory is preserved not



only as the addressee of a few el-Amarna letters but also as the
owner of a rich sepulcher in Akhet-Aton. King Akhnaton, desirous
of making a special gift to his favorites, presented each with a tomb
built during the lifetime of the recipient and engraved with scenes
from the life of the king and his family, the owner of the tomb - but
usually not his family - being portrayed as a small figure receiving
honors from the king. In the tomb of Dudu there are also figures of
Semites rejoicing at Dudu's rewards. A letter written to this Dudu
will be quoted later on.
Still another resemblance to Joseph was found in the person of
Ianhama,4 who, according to the references in the el-Amarna
letters, was an Egyptian chief in charge of the granaries of the state,
where grain was bought by the Canaanite princes. There was a
famine in the land, and it is an unceasing cry for grain that we hear
from the letters of the king of Gubla and Sumur (Sumura).
One further conjecture may be recorded. The visit of Isaac and
Rebecca or of Abraham and Sarah to Egypt5 was linked to some
references to a handmaid of the goddess of the city of Gubla and
her husband, who were in Egypt. The king of Gubla and Sumur
supported the couple in their desire to return to Canaan, if he did
not actually ask for their extradition.
But the theory identifying the Habiru and the Hebrews was not
abandoned; it seemed that otherwise the histories of these two
peoples of antiquity, the Egyptians and the Hebrews, who
inhabited neighboring countries, would show no connecting link in
the course of many hundreds of years of their early history. The
other possible link - the Memeptah stele, with which I sbAll deal
later - was also interpreted both in support of and against the
Habiru-Hebrew theory.
The equation Habiru-Hebrews is still accepted by a large number
of scholars: at the time when the el-Amarna letters were written the
Israelite nomads of the desert were knocking at the gates of the
land which they had come to conquer. Did this opinion contradict
the scheme according to which the Israelites were still in bondage



under Ramses II? If so, then the conception had to be formulated
anew, and the migration of the Hebrews was then supposed to
have proceeded in consecutive stages. Reconciling theories were
put forth dividing the Exodus into several successive departures,
the Rachel clan and the Leah clan leaving at different times; when
the former reached Canaan the latter was still being oppressed in
Egypt and followed later. Another theory had the Josephites
coming from Egypt and the Jacobites directly from Mesopotamia;
still another variation had the Jacobites coming from Egypt and the
Abrahamites from the north.
A further difficulty presented by the equation Habiru-Hebrews
arose from the fact that no person in the Book of Joshua could be
identified in the el-Amarna letters. When the Israelites entered
Canaan, Adonizedek was king of Jerusalem, Hoham king of
Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir
king of Eglon (Joshua 10:3). Among the letters there are a number
written by kings of some of these places but not by these kings.
Much more important is the fact that there is little similarity in the
events described in both sources. The episode of the siege of
Jericho, the most remarkable occurrence in the first period of the
conquest, is missing in the letters, and Jericho is not mentioned at
all. This silence is strange, if the Habiru were the Hebrews under
Joshua. No contemporaneous event can be traced in the letters.
The pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Seti and Ramses II, left
memorial monuments in Egypt and in Palestine regarding their
passage through Palestine as conquerors of the land lost by the
pharaohs of the el-Amarna period or by their successors. In the
Books of Joshua and Judges, covering over four hundred years,
nothing suggests the hegemony of Egypt or her interference in the
affairs of Canaan.
For all these reasons it seemed too bold to place the story of the
conquest by the Hebrews so far back in time. The discussion is still
in progress. Some of those who could not accept the theory that
the Hebrews had already entered Canaan at the time of
Amenhotep and Akhnaton identified the Habiru as the Apiru, the



workers in the Egyptian quarries on the Sinai Peninsula, on their
seasonal journey from there to their homes in Lebanon; others
identified them as migrants from the Babylonian district of Afiru.
How could the Hebrews have reached Canaan before they left
Egypt? Or how could they have left their bondage in Egypt before
it was weakened?
According to my chronological scheme, the letters of el-Amarna,
sent and received by Amenhotep and Akhnaton, were written, not
in - 1410 to - 1370 as is generally accepted, but in - 870 to - 840,
at the time of King Jehoshaphat in Jerusalem.6 If this theory is
correct, among the tablets of the el-Amarna collection we should
expect to find letters written by the royal scribes, skilled in
cuneiform, in the name of the Israelite Icings of Jerusalem and of
Samaria. The most prolific writer of letters among the princes and
chiefs was the king of Sumur (Samaria). About sixty letters of his
are pre-served, fifty-four of them addressed to the king of Egypt.
The pharaoh even wrote to him: "Thou writest to me more than all
the regents."
The three hundred and sixty letters, linking the political past of
the great and small nations of the Near East at an important period
of remote antiquity, were objects of prolonged study in the interest
of Egyptian, Babylonian, Hittite, Syrian, and Canaanite histories.
The statement made above as to the time of the letters should not
be accepted merely because it fits into a scheme built on other
evidences of preceding or following periods. It should be
demonstrated with respect to the letters themselves. Besides the
Scriptures and the el-Amarna tablets, two other sources relate to
the time of King Jehoshaphat: the stele of King Mesha of Moab and
the inscriptions of the Assyrian king, Shalmaneser. These relics, too,
and not the Bible alone, must correspond to the contents of the el
Amarna letters, if it is true that Egyptian history must be revised
and moved forward more than half a thousand years.
1 The translations into German are by Hugo Winckler and by J. A. Knudtzon. The work of
the last-named Scandinavian scientist is of classical value for the study of the Tell el



Amarna tablets. The translation into English is by S. A. B. Mercer (1939). Twelve letters
found since the publication by Knudtzon are included in Mercer's English edition. The
letters are similarly numbered in Knudtzon's and Mercer's editions. In this chapter
quotations from the letters are taken from the English version of Mercer (The Tell el
Amarna Tablets [Toronto, 1939]). However, the translations have been checked in
Knudtzon's version.

Jerusalem, Samaria, and Jezreel
The letters of el-Amarna provide us with the names of princes and
governors in Syria and Palestine and with the names of cities and
walled places. Up to now not one of the personal names has been
identified, and only several of the geographical names have been
traced. I shall identify some important geographical locations and
also a series of personal names.
Urusalim of the el-Amarna letters could not be misunderstood;
there was no difficulty in recognizing it as Jerusalem. The difficulty
arose only with respect to the passages in the Scriptures1 according
to which the pre-Israelite city was called Salem or Jebus, and not
Jerusalem. It was decided that the el-Amarna letters exposed the
error of these statements. If, however, the el-Amarna letters were
written in the Israelite period, the above conflict does not exist.
Sumur (also Sumura) and Gubla are the most frequently named
cities in the el-Amarna letters, each being mentioned more than
one hundred times. Other cities are not mentioned even ten or
fifteen times. "No king's or prince's name is given for this city
Sumur, next to Gubla the most frequently referred to; despite the



distress that came upon her, no letter from there is to be found in
the entire el-Amarna correspondence."2
It is obvious from the content of the letters that Sumur was the
"most important place" in Syria-Palestine and apparently also the
seat of the deputy administering the region. It was a fortress.3 A
king's ,palace was there, and the frequent mention of this palace in
the letters to the pharaoh gives the impression that it was a well
known building.
Sumur or Sumura was Samaria ( - erne; l omron, in Hebrew). It
could not be presumed that Sumur was Samaria because it was in
the reign of Omri, father of Ahab, that this city was built, and in the
period preceding the conquest of Joshua, of course, it had not
existed.
I KINGS 16:24 And he [Omri] bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
silver, and built on the bill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the
name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
Since vowels were a late interpolation in the Hebrew Bible,
inserted by the Masoretes ("carriers of the tradition") over a
thousand years after the Old Testament had been completed, the
name Semer can also be read Sumur.
Samaria was surrounded by a strong wall, and remnants of it
have been unearthed. The city had a magnificent royal palace, and
the ruins of it are seen today.
The identity of Sumur ( Sumura) and Samaria will be shown in
detail in the following pages, which describe the history of the
period.
Together with Sumur, Gubla is named repeatedly. Evidence has
been found in the letters that Gubla was considered heir to Sumur
when this city was temporarily occupied by the Syrians. The king of
Gubla wrote to the pharaoh in Egypt:
LETTER 85: What was formerly given in [to] Sumura, should now be given in [to]
Gubla.



There is scarcely a letter of the king of Gubla in which his
uneasiness about Sumur does not find expression. He mentioned
the name of Sumur or Sumura about eighty-five times in his letters,
besides the numerous times that the city is referred to as "king's
city" or "my city."
It was assumed that Gubla is Byblos, Kpny in Egyptian, but Gwal
in Phoenician and Hebrew,4 the Phoenician city north of Beirut.
However, there must have been more than one Gwal ("border") in
the region of Syria-Palestine; for instance, there is a reference in the
Scriptures to Gwal in the south of Palestine.5 It was also asked why
the city of Gwal (Byblos) was changed to Gubla in the el-Amarna
letters.
A few times the king of Gubla mentioned in his letters the city of
Batruna, and it is identified as the ancient Botrys.6 However,
Menander, a Greek author, quoted by Josephus,7 says of Ithobalos
(Ethbaal), the king of Tyre in the ninth century, that "it was he
who founded the city Botrys in Phoenicia." Having been built by
the father-in-law of King Ahab, the city Botrys could be mentioned
in the el-Amarna tablets only if the founding of the city preceded
the el-Amarna age - which complies with the present
reconstruction.
If Sumur is Samaria, then it is apparent that Gubla is the original
name of Jezreel, the other capital in Israel. Omri built Samaria and
its palace. Ahab, his son, built his palace in Jezreel, adjacent to the
vineyard of Naboth. There Queen Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, later
met a violent death. Jezebel (Izebel), in the memory of the people
the most hated person of the period of the Kings, was a daughter of
the Sidonian king Ethbaal (I Kings 16:31). She brought the evil of
the heathen into the land, killed the prophets of Yahwe, and
persecuted Elijah the Tishbite. Hundreds of prophets of Baal "eat at
Jezebel's table" (I Kings 18:19). The king under her influence "went
and served Baal, and worshipped him" (I Kings 16:31). Josephus
Flavius says that Jezebel built a temple to the deity "whom they call
Belias."8



The king of Gubla wrote in almost all his letters: "May Belt
[Baalis] of Gubla give power. . . ." Belit of these letters seems to
have been the deity Baaltis, or Belias, whose cult was brought from
Phoenicia.9
Gubla thus appears to have been the original name of the royal
residence city we know from the Scriptures as Jezreel. King Ahab
must have had many wives, for he left seventy sons in Samaria (II
Kings 10:1). But the daughter of the Sidonian king was Ahab's
chief wife. She exercised charm and influence over him, and he
built for her the new residence with her active participation, as the
story of Naboth relates. It was not to be expected that Ahab, the
apostate, would name the new residence in honor of the
persecuted deity, the God of Israel ("the Lord will sow"). It is
possible that the name of the new residence was derived from the
name of the Phoenician city, dear to the Phoenician princess, now
queen of Israel. It may be surmised, too, that the residence was
named in honor of this wife,Jebel, or Gubla in cuneiform
transcription, Izebel ( Jezebel) in the biblical transcription.10
In the Scriptures there is a direct indication that Jezreel was
previously called by the name of Queen Jezebel. When her life
ended ignominiously, dogs tore her flesh "and the carcass of
Jezebel [was] as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of
Jezreel, about which they [should] not say, This is Jezebel" (II Kings
9:37)11 The meaning of the sentence is that the name of the place
should be blotted out with the death of the queen, by whose name
it had been called. After that the city was given the name of the
valley - Jezree1.12
We shall proceed on the assumption that Sumur and Gubla were
Samaria and Jezreel in Israel: the two cities were the two capitals of
one state. The King of Gubla was worried about his other capital,
alternately lost and recovered in incessant wars with the Syrians.
When Sumur fell Gubla became its heir. We thus have the answer
to the question of why no king of Sumur is mentioned in the el
Amarna letters, although the city is named so often: its king had his



residence in Gubla. Possibly some of the letters which bear the
usual blessing, "May Belit of Gubla give power," were written from
Sumur ( Samaria ).
Having raised the curtain on the scene of the main action of the
el-Amarna period, we must identify the persons on the stage.

10 It is possible that the name Jezebel (Izebel) is a later form of Zebel; addition of the I
lends to the name an ignominious Anracter of denial or curse, as in the name I-chabod (I
Samuel 3:21).
11 The King James translation is: "so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.'
12 The site of the residence city of Jezreel has not been established. Its traditional site in the
east of the valley disclosed no antiquities. It is probable, rather, that Jezreel is to be looked
for in the west of the valley. Ahab, taking a daughter of the Sidonian king to wife, might
have been anxious also to have a share in the maritime trade of the Phoenicians. Elijah ran
without stopping from Carmel to Jezreel (I Kings 18:46).
The Five Kings
The kings of the ancient Orient usually bore many names. The
letters of el-Amarna were addressed to the pharaoh Nimmuria and
the pharaoh Naphuria. Nimmuria was Amenhotep , and Na
phuria, Amenhotep IV ( Aichnaton ). Egyptian kings regularly had
as many as five names.1 Not from the e1-Amarna letters but from
other Egyptian documents, it is known that Nimmuria was the



throne name of Amenhotep and Naphuria the throne name of
Akhnaton. In the letters there is no mention of the names
Amenhotep or Akhnaton.
The kings of Jerusalem, as well as the kings of Samaria and
Damascus, also had more than one name. Five different names for
Solomon are preserved.2 King Hezekiah of Jerusalem had nine
names.3 In view of this practice, there is only a limited chance of
finding in the el-Amarna letters the names of the kings of Palestine
as we know them from the Scriptures.
But if the kings had many names, this does not mean that we are
free in our choice of substitutes. No doors to indiscriminate
identification are opened. The life and wars of the Syrian and
Palestinian kings of this period are described with many details in
the Scriptures and in the letters; all these details will be placed
source against source.
At this point in the discussion, should my identification of
AbdiHiba with Jehoshaphat, Rib-Addi with Ahab, and Ben-Hadad
with Abdi-Ashirta seem arbitrary, I shall be pleased: in the hall of
history, crowded with throngs of men from many centuries, I point
straightway to certain figures bearing names entirely different from
those of the persons we are looking for; they are even said to
belong to an age separated by six centuries from the time of the
persons we are seeking. Even before I have investigated the
persons thus without apparent justification singled out, I shall insist
on the identification.
The searching rod in my hand is the rod of time measurement: I
reduce by six centuries the age of Thebes and el-Amarna, and I
find King Jehoshaphat in Jerusalem, Ahab in Samaria, Ben-Hadad
in Damascus. If my rod of time measurement does not mislead me,
they are the kings who reigned in Jerusalem, Samaria, and
Damascus in the el-Amarna period.
The el-Amarna letters were written in the days of Amenhotep
and his son Akhnaton some seventy-odd years after Thutmose III
had conquered Palestine and sacked the Temple of Kadesh. Having



established the contemporaneity of Solomon and Hatshepsut
(Queen of Sheba), of Rehoboam and Thutmose III (Shishak), and
of Asa and Amenhotep II (Zerah), we are compelled to conclude
that the Jerusalem correspondent of Amenhotep and Akhnaton
was King Jehoshaphat. We are no longer free: either we have been
wrong up to this point, or the contents of the el-Amarna letters will
correspond to the scriptural information about the time of
Jehoshaphat. We must be sure of this even before we open for the
first time The el-Amarna Tablets.
Five kings - two successive kings of Damascus, one of Israel, one
of Judah, and one of Moab - were the main characters on the stage
of the political life of the Egyptian provinces of Syria and Palestine
at the time under study. For two of them the Scriptures retained
similar names: Hazael, the king of Damascus, is called Aziru, Azira,
or Azaru in the el-Amarna letters. The king of Moab, Mesha, is
called, as we shall see, Mesh in the letters.
The name of the king of Jerusalem of the el-Amarna letters is
read Abdi-Hiba. However, the same characters, if regarded as
ideographic, permit another reading; at first it was proposed to
read it Ebed-Tov ("The Good Servant" in Hebrew) and then Puti
Hiba;5 others read it Aradhepa or Arthahepa.6 From this fact we
see that names written in cuneiform may be read in many ways,
and the reading Abdi-Hiba is only one surmise among a number of
others.7 It would appear that the original reading Ebed-Tov is
preferable.
The name of the king of Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat, may not even
have been one of his several original names; it could have been a
name given him by his people to commemorate his deeds. It
means "Yahwe [Jahve] is the judge" or "one who judges in the
name of Yahwe." This king sent Levites throughout the cities of
Judah with a "book of the law of Yahwe" to teach the people (II
Chronicles 17:9), and a high court for the "judgment of Yahwe"
was established in Jerusalem (II Chronicles 19:8-10).



II CHRONICLES 19:5-6 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced
cities of Judah, city by city.
And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for
Yahwe, who is with you in the judgment.
He also built a new palace of justice in Jerusalem (II Chronicles
20:5). A king whose endeavor was dedicated to this work might
receive in the memory of a nation the agnomen Jehoshaphat. The
talmudic tradition asserts, for instance, that Solomon ("Peace") was
a post-mortem name of the king, son of David.
The name Rib-Addi, written in ideograms, means "the elder
[brother among the sons] of the father," the first part of the name
signifying "the elder" brother or "the elder" son, and the second part
"father." It is construed like the Hebrew name Ahab, the first part of
which means "brother" (ah), the second part "father" (ab).
In the correspondence with Egypt the king of Amuru land was
called Abdi-Ashirta (spelled also Abdu-Astarti, Adra-Astarti).
It may be gathered from the letters of the king of Sumur8 that the
seat of the kings of Amuru land, Abdi-Ashirta and Azaru, was in
Dumaska (Damascus). Thus Amuru land of the letters is Aram
(Syria) of the scriptural text. That Amuru land means Syria we
learn also from an inscription of Shalmaneser III.9
According to Nicholas of Damascus, a historian of the first
century B.C., Ben-Hadad was a generic name for the kings of
Damascus.10 Many biblical scholars are also of the opinion that the
name Ben-Hadad was a general designation for the kings of
Damascus,11 and historians assume that the king of Damascus who
was Ahab's opponent was actually called Biridri; he was the leader
of a coalition against Shalmaneser , as we know from an inscription
of that Assyrian king. "How the name came to be translated Ben
Hadad in the Scriptures is uncertain?"
12
We shall discover the real Biridri in the el-Amarna letters in the
person of the commandant of Megiddo.



It was the custom to name kings in conformity with the religious
worship practiced in their domains. The worship of Astarte and
Asheroth in the time of Ben-Hadad is mentioned in the
Scriptures.13
The name Abd' Astart was in use in the ninth century: Josephus
Flavius, quoting a no longer extant work of Menander of Ephesus,
gives a royal list of the Phoenician kings. Hiram, the contemporary
of Solomon, had a grandson by the name of Abd' Astart, who at
the age of thirty-nine was killed by four sons of his nurse.14 This
story may be an echo of the assassination of Ben-Hadad (II Kings
8).
The scriptural version of the name Hazael, Z and r being
interchangeable characters, differs from the name in the tablets
(Aziru or Azaru) in the aspirate sound h.15 Scholars who derived
Ivri (Hebrew) from Habiru should find no difficulty in deriving
Hazael from Azaru. Josephus Flavius called Hazael by the name
Azaelos.
The kings of Jerusalem and of Samaria were hereditary princes.
In the el-Amarna letters they call themselves rabiti sari, princes or
regents; from the context of the letters it is clear that each of them
sat on the throne of his father. The regent king of Samaria recalled
to the pharaoh the time when his father was helped by the
pharaoh's father. And the king of Jerusalem wrote:
LETTER 286: Behold, neither my father nor ray mother has put me in this place. The
mighty hand of the king has led me into the house of my father.
This means that the pharaoh of Egypt was wont to choose from
among the royal princes one to succeed his father, the vassal king.
Governors were attached to "the regents," the vassal kings, as
representatives of the Egyptian crown. One was for northern Syria,
with his seat probably at Damascus. Another governor had his seat
in Samaria (Sumur). We shall meet both of them not only in the
letters but also in the Scriptures, and we shall recognize them there.



In Jerusalem there was no permanent deputy. In one of his
letters the king of Jerusalem asked that the "deputy of the king,"
whose seat was in Gaza, be sent to visit Jerusalem.16 Occasionally
a deputy officer did visit Jerusalem.17 These consular visits by
invitation and the absence of a permanent representative of the
Egyptian crown suggest that the king of Jerusalem was a vassal
with greater independence than the other kings and chiefs..
Although the kings of Jerusalem and Samaria were themselves
vassals, they had their own tributaries. The king of Jerusalem
received homage and tribute in silver and cattle from the kings of
Arabia and from the Philistines (II Chronicles 17:11). The king of
Moab, Mesha, was tributary to Samaria (II Kings 3:4). In the el
Amarna letters we shall often meet "the rebel Mesh"; his name is
mentioned so frequently that it was thought to be a grammatical
form indicating a group. We 01911 readily see that amel-gaz-Mesh,
in the singular, was "the rebel Mesh," the rebellious king of Moab,
and the amelut-gaz-Mesh were "the people of the rebel Mesh" or
the Moabites.
Unlike the kings, other persons on the historical scene generally
had but one name. The names of the Egyptian military governors
and those of the army chiefs in Judah, as well as several other
names, are similar in the el-Amarna letters and in the Bible. The
similarity or identity of the names is corroborated by the identity of
the functions of their bearers, as presented in the Scriptures and in
the letters.
Not only can the personages in Judah, Israel, Moab, and Syria
be traced in the Books of Kings and Chronicles and in the letters of
el-Amarna; the names of the rulers of the tiny kingdoms in Syria
also may be compared in the el-Amarna letters and in the
inscriptions of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, who lived in the time
of Jehoshaphat and Ahab. Both sources - the el-Amarna letters and
the inscriptions of the Assyrian king - are written in the same
characters, cuneiform. Later in this discourse on the el-Amarna
letters the participants in the war of resistance against the invader
from the north will be identified.

The Letters of Jehoshaphat's Captains
King Jehoshaphat had five captains at the head of his army.
II CHRONICLES 17:14-19 And these are the numbers of them according [in
obeisance] to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah
the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.
And next to him was Jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore
thousand.
And next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the
Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.
And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow
and shield two hundred thousand.
And next to him was Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand
ready prepared for the war.
These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities
throughout all Judah.
The phrase, "in obeisance to the houses of their fathers," is of
essential value. It points to the existence of a feudal system at that
time, in which rank in the army was hereditary, passing from father
to son. We shall find in the next generation the names of the cap..
tains Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan, and Elishaphat, the son of
Zichri.1 The number of men under each of the five chiefs might
mean that in their feudal districts there were one, two, or three
hundred thousand men fit for conscription; however, another
explanation is possible, and it is presented in one of the following
sections.
The el-Amarna letters offer rich material on the feudal system in
Judah at that time.
We identify letters written by three of the five military chiefs of
Jehoshaphat. Their position as military chiefs is the same in the
letters as in the Book of Chronicles; their names are easily
recognizable. A slight variation in one of the names has a
connotation that will lead us to reflection on the development of
religion in Judah and on the reform that took place shortly after the
death of Jehoshaphat.
Addudani (also spelled Addadani) of the el-Amarna letters is
called in the Scriptures Adna.2 But the inscription of Shamshi



Ramman, who became the Assyrian king after Shalmaneser in
825, contains a reference to a gift he received from Ada-danu,
prince of Gaza (Azati).3 The "son of Zuchru" of the el-Amarna
letters is called the "son of Zichri" in the Bible.4 Ialwibada of the el
Amarna letters is Iehozabad (Jehozabad) in the Scriptures.
These officers were really important chiefs of the army, as the
pharaoh corresponded directly with them; yet in their letters the
expressions of obeisance disclose their more subordinate role and
differ from those in the letters of the king in Jerusalem.
In keeping with his position as chief among the captains,
Addudani carried on an extensive correspondence with the
pharaoh, and four of his letters, written at length, are preserved.
From them we learn the complicated system in which a chief was
bound directly to the pharaoh, to the local deputy of the pharaoh,
and to the king (regent) in Jerusalem. The pharaoh wrote to
Addudani:
LETTER 294: Hearken to thy deputy and protect the cities of the king, thy lord, which
are in thy care.
Addudani replied with assurances of his loyalty:
LETTER 292: Thus saith Addudani, thy servant . . . I have heard the words, which
the king, my lord, has written to his servant: "Protect thy deputy and protect the cities
of the king, thy lord." Behold, I protect, and, behold, I hearken day and night to the
words of the king, my lord. And let the king, my lord, pay attention to his servant.
After this introduction he reported on local affairs, on
preparations to meet the archers of the king, on caravans, on
conflicts between him and a deputy, on a garrison he had placed in
Jaffa, and so on.
The same words were written to the son "of Zuchru": "Protect the
cities of the king which are in thy care." This order is repeated in
the reply of the son of Zuchru. The custom of repeating in epistles
whole sentences from the letter being answered resulted in the
preservation of valuable items out of lost tablets of the el-Amarna
period.



The first name of the writer is not preserved, only his second
name, "of Zuchru.5 In the scriptural list of the five chiefs of
Jehoshaphat, only one is called by the name of his father:
Amaziah, son of Zichri. It is interesting to note that in the el
Amarna letters also, only in the case of the son of Zuchru is the
name of his father attached. The scriptural text explains the
distinction: Zichri sacrificed himself willingly to God; his
descendants were honored by the name "sons of Zichri" (II
Chronicles 17:16; 23:1).
Zichri of the (Massorete) Bible is Zuchru of the el-Amarna letters;
Amaziah, the son of Zichri, is the "son of Zuchru," the captain who
wrote to the pharaoh on matters relating to the security of his
district.6
Iehozabad (Jehozabad) of the Second Book of Chronicles is
called Iahzibada in the letters he wrote to the pharaoh. These few
short letters are acknowledgments of Pharaoh's orders. The place
from which they were written is not indicated, but they were written
from southern Palestine; in the Second Book of Chronicles ( 17:17
- 18 ) it is said that he was a chief in the land of Benjamin.
Iehozabad is mentioned as the last among the five military chiefs
of Jehoshaphat's kingdom. He does not enter into discussions with
the pharaoh, nor does he give advice like the first in rank among
the captains, but as a good soldier he accepts and acknowledges
the orders of the pharaoh. Here is one of his stereotyped letters:
LETTERS 275: To the king, my lord, my gods, my sun, say: Thus saith Iahzibada, thy
servant, the dust of thy feet:
At the feet of the king, my lord, my gods, my sun, seven times and seven times I fall
down. The word which the king, my lord, my gods, my sun, has spoken to me, verily, I
will execute it for the king, my lord.
The areas of administration of Judah and Benjamin, as they
were divided among the chiefs and the sari of the cities, may be
determined approximately by the combined information of the el
Amarna letters and the Scriptures. In Knudtzon's edition (and also
in Mercer's) the el-Amarna letters are ordered according to the
geographical location of their writers, the correspondents from the



north preceding those from the south. It is to the credit of the
industrious work of Knudtzon that the letters of Addadani, son of
Zuchru, and Iahzibada are placed next to the letters of the king of
Jerusalem; thus he correctly located these correspondents in the
southern part of Palestine.
1 II Chronicles 23:1.
2 In the form "Adna" the divine name "Addu" (Addu of Dan) is mutilated; this mutilation
was probably the work of the holy penman, who would not admit that a man close to the
pious Jehoshaphat had borne the name of AdduDani.

relates Azzati to Gaza (Aza in Hebrew).
4 II Chronicles 17:16.
5 Letter 384.
6 Letter 385.
Adaia, the Deputy
We have in Chapter 23 of Second Chronicles a list of the chiefs in
the sixteenth year after Jehoshaphat. Instead of Amaziah, son of
Zichri, Flishaphat, son of Zichri, served; Ishmael, son of
Jehohanan, replaced his father as one of the chiefs of the army. As
previously stated, the post of chief passed from father to son and
from one brother to another, clearly marking it as a feudal
institution. In that sixteenth year after Jehoshaphat there was a
chief named Maaseiah, son of Adaia (Adaja). Adaia must have
lived in the days of Jehoshaphat and must have been in the service
of the king. The el-Amarna letters give us a clue to his role. He was
apparently the king's deputy in Edom, adjacent to Benjamin, and
for some time also had charge over the gateway of Gaza through
which traffic with Egypt was maintained.
In the Scriptures it is said that in the time of Jehoshaphat "there
was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king" (I Kings 22:47). This
land was under the control of the king of Jerusalem and was a
dependency of Judah (II Chronicles 21:8).



Four times Adaia's name is mentioned in three passages in the
letters of the king of Jerusalem:
LETTER 285: Addaia, the deputy of the king [pharaoh] . . .
LETTER 287: . . . Addaia has departed together with the garrison of the officers
which the king had given. Let the king know that Adaia has said to me: "Verily, let me
depart."1
LETTER 289: The garrison which thou hast sent. . . . Addaia has taken and placed in
his house in Hazati.
These letters inform us that Adaia was a deputy of the pharaoh,
and that he was subordinate to the king-regent in Jerusalem.2 The
deputy in Edom, a dependent land of Judah, was actually
subordinate to the king of Jerusalem.
1 In his transliteration, Knudtzon gives these varying spellings of the name.
2 In Letter 254 it is said that Dumuia was entrusted to Adaia. Does this name mean an
individual, or could it stand for Dumah in Seir, or Edom (Isaiah 21:11)?
City-Princes
The list of the five chiefs of Jehoshaphat, as given in Second
Chronicles, ended with the passage: "These waited on the king,
beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all
Judah." Jehoshaphat sent Levites to these city-princes to guide
them spiritually:
II CHRONICLES 17:7 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even
to Ben-Hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah . . . to teach in the cities of Judah.
A city-prince whose name was Vidia wrote to the pharaoh from
Askelon in southern Palestine. Seven tablets in the el-Amarna
collection are signed with his name. His domain was confined to a
single city. Accordingly, Vidia wrote:
LETTER 320: I protect the place of the king, which is in my care.
LETTER 326: I protect the city of the king, my lord.



Vidia received a deputy from the pharaoh and prepared a tribute
for him.
In Egypt the monarch was deified as the incarnation of the god,
the son of the sun, and the sun itself. In accordance with Egyptian
religious beliefs the subordinate chiefs in the tributary lands
addressed the pharaoh thus: "To the king, my lord, my god, my
sun, the sun in heaven." So wrote also Vidia from Askelon.
The idolatry and pagan influence made the cities around
Jerusalem "halt between two opinions," to use Elijah's expression. It
was therefore necessary to undertake the task of enlightening the
people: ". . . and he [Jehoshaphat] went out again through the
people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them
back unto the Lord God of their fathers" (II Chronicles 19:4 ).
These efforts met with only partial success, as the Scriptures
acknowledge: ". . . yet the people had not prepared their hearts
unto the God of their fathers" (II Chronicles 20:33).
Amon, the Governor of Samaria
In the Syrian and Palestinian realms the sovereign of Egypt kept his
deputies at the side of the regent-kings. The deputy in Sumur
during the first part of Rib-Addi's reign was, according to the el
Amarna letters, Aman-appa. In a letter from the king of Sumur to
Aman-appa it is said:
LETTER 73: Thou knowest my attitude: Whilst thou wast in Sumura, that I was thy
faithful servant.
We meet this governor in the Second Book of Chronicles.
CHRONICLES 18:25 Then the king of Israel said, Take thou Micaiah [the prophet],
and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son.
Because of his position the name of Amon, the governor, was
placed before that of the prince of royal blood. That he was an
Egyptian is implied by his name, which is the holy name of an
Egyptian deity.1



After his return to Egypt Amon was regarded by the king of
Sumur (Samaria) as a friend and as an advocate of his cause
before the pharaoh, and was recommended as an expert in the
military and political matters of Sumur. The king of Sumur wrote to
the pharaoh:
LETTER 74: Verily, Aman-appa is with thee. Ask him. He knows that and has seen
the distress which oppresses me.
He asked Aman-appa to come again to Sumur and to bring
archers with him:
LETTER 77: Hast thou not said to thy lord that he sends thee at the head of the
archers?
The king of Sumur was very intimate with the deputy of the
pharaoh. In another letter he wrote:
LETTER 93: "I come to thee," thou didst write to me. Hear me. Say to the king to give
to thee three hundred people.
In all these matters the vassal king and the governor exchanged
advice and expressed their common concern for Sumur (Samaria).
Aman-appa, as the letters show, was opposed to the policy of
supporting the king of Damascus. In the Scriptures, too, Amon, the
governor of Samaria, by imprisoning the prophet who warned
against making war on the king of Damascus,2 showed his
endorsement of the policy of regaining the lost cities by arms.
In the time of the el-Amarna correspondence Aman-appa was an
aged man; he did not live until the end of that period.'3 The king of
Sumtu. ( Samaria), who for some time had heard nothing from
Aman-appa in Egypt, wrote to him affectionately: "If thou art dead,
I shall die, too:4
"To Aman-appa, my father, thus said Rib-Addi, thy son," wrote
the king of Sumur (Samaria). This expression of respect is
preserved in dialogues of the same period, as recorded in the
Scriptures. The king of Samaria spoke similarly to Elisha: "My
father" (II Kings 6:21).



The title by which the governor, Amon, is known in the
Scriptures, sar, is often applied to dignitaries in the el-Amarna
letters.
In the Scriptures the name of the governor of Samaria is given as
Amon. In the el-Amarna letters the governor of Sumur was
Amanappa. They were the same person.5
1 Amon was also the name cf the son of Manasseh, king of Jerusalem, in the seventh
century (II Chronicles 33:20-25). Of Manasseh it is said that he "made Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem to err" (II Chronicles 38:9).
2 Kings 22:26-27.
3 Letter 106: "There is hostility against Sumur. And verily, its deputy is now dead."
4 Letter 87.
5 Early in this century in Tell Taannek, the biblical Taanach, on the hills in the region of the
Esclraelon Valley, a few tablets written in cuneiform were found; they are very similar to
those of the el-Amarna collection. In one of them a governor by the name of Arran-hasir
exacted tribute from the local' mayor (E Spun, "Tell Ta'annek," Denkschriften der
Akad,emie der Wissenschaften, Philosophisch-Historische Masse, Vol. 50 [Vienna, 1904]).
The reading of Arran-hasir was revised by Albright to Aman-hatpe: "Amara-hatpe,
Governor of Palestine," Zeitschrift für agyptische Sprache and Altertumskunde, LXII
(1927), 63f. His reading was accepted by A. Gustays, Die Personennamen in den Tontafeln
von Tell Taanek, p. 26. Albright made a surmise that this governor was the future pharaoh
Amenhotep II.
The First Siege of Samaria by the King of Damascus
The kings of Judah and Israel were loyal to the Egyptian crown;
but the king of the Syrian kingdom used the balance of strength in
the north and the south to increase his domain.
The letters of Abdi-Ashirta (Ben-Hadad) of Damascus were
humble despite or because of his treacherous intentions. The usual
form of respectful address toward a potentate was: "I fall down
seven and seven times to the feet of my lord"; to this the king of
Damascus usually added when writing to the pharaoh: "Thy
servant and the mud of thy feet, thy dog."
According to the Scriptures, Ben-Hadad, the ling of Damascus,
was a descendant of Rezon, who "fled from his lord" and "gathered



men unto him, and became captain over a band; . . . and they
went to Damascus . . . and reigned in Damascus."1
The Icing of Sumur (Samaria) and other vassal kings called the
king of Damascus "the slave."
LETTER 71: What is Abdi-Ashfrta, the servant, the dog, that he should take the land
of the king to himself? What is his family?
From the days of Rezon on, in consequence of Damascus'
politics, which encouraged a spirit of rivalry between Israel and
Judah, these two countries continued to be hostile to each other.
Baasha, king of Israel, built Ramah against Judah and threatened
her. Asa, king of Judah, sent presents to Ben-Hadad, and Ben
Hadad turned against Baasha and "smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel
beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali" (I
Kings 15:20). Judah took Mount Ephraim (II Chronicles 17:2). This
happened two generations after Solomon and a few decades
before the el-Amarna period.
The new dynasty of Omri at its beginning strengthened the
kingdom of Israel. It was the time when the Egyptian hegemony
over Palestine had been re-established by Thutmose IV, the father
of Amenhotep III
In the time of Ahab, the son of Omri, Ben-Hadad2 renewed
hostilities and arranged a coalition of chieftains depending on him:
I KINGS 20:1 And Ben-Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and
there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots.
In the letter of the king of Sumur (Samaria) we find a complaint:
LETTER 90: All the majors [chieftains] are one with Abdi-Ashirta.
The king of Damascus laid siege to Samaria.
I KINGS 20:1 . . . and he [Ben-Hadad] went up and besieged Samaria, and warred
against it.
This campaign opened a long series of sieges, battles, short
truces, and renewed oppressions that occupied the period



described in the last six chapters of the First Book of Kings and the
first nine chapters of the Second Book.
Hostility against Sumur has become very great
is repeated in several letters from the king of Sumur ( Samaria).
The time was opportune. The land of Israel was visited by
drought; national feeling in the Ten Tribes was dwindling. The
worship of pagan images laid the northern kingdom open to the
spiritual influences of the surrounding nations. Religious ties
between Samaria, $idon, and Damascus melted away the frontiers.
Even the prophets - Elijah from Gilead and Elisha, his successor
intervened in the state affairs of Damascus, visited there and were
visited by people from there.
In this state of spiritual and material decline the land of Samaria
was a prey to the shrewd warrior and politician of Damascus. All
the lands as far north as the Orontes flows were "the lands of the
king, the lord," the pharaoh of Egypt; but this circumstance did not
prevent the Damascene from seeking to extend his domain. He
was aware that the approach of the king of Assyria along the valley
of the Orontes provided him with a chance to play a double game.
He knew that the Egyptian king would not like to see him desert
and openly go over to the war-minded Assyrians, the conquerors
who pounded at the strongholds of northern Syria without
declaring war on Egypt. The hazardous policy of the king of
Damascus looked for a victim; Samaria was marked to be the first,
and it was put under siege.
King Ahab asked a prophet whence help would come. "The
young men of the governors of the provinces" would put the
Syrians to flight, was the answer (I Kings 20:14 ). What did this
mean? Why should the Syrian host be afraid of the governors'
guard if they were not afraid of the king's army? In the battle at the
wall of Samaria "two hundred and thirty-two young men of the
governors of the provinces," leading Samaria's small garrison, put
the Syrians to flight. The answer may be found in the letters.



The king of Sumur and Gubla (Jezreel), in his letters to the
pharaoh and also to the governors, repeatedly asked that small
detachments of archers be sent him. One such letter was quoted in
the previous section: the governor was asked to send three
hundred people to relieve the city.
The bearers of the emblem of the Egyptian state (the young men
of the governors of the provinces) were a kind of gendarmerie
attached to the governors of the pharaoh. These small detachments
numbered tens, seldom hundreds, of men. In executing their duty,
they were backed by the regular troops of Egypt, and their
appearance at the place of dispute between the vassals of the
Egyptian crown heralded a definite decision on the part of the
pharaoh to support one of the rivals with arms. The impatience
with which such a detachment for the relief of Samaria was
awaited is reflected in the following passage from a letter of the
king of Sumur to Haia(?), a dignitary in Egypt:
LETTER 71: Why hast thou held back and not said to the king that he should send
archers that they may take Sumura? What is Abdi-Ashirta, the servant, the dog, that
he should take the land of the king to himself? . . . send me fifty pairs of horses and
two hundred infantry . . . till the archers go forth. . . .
Ben-Hadad boasted of his troops that the dust of Samaria would
not suffice for handfuls for all the people that followed him (I Kings
'20:10). The victory over this army was accomplished when the
representatives of the suzerainty appeared at the head of the
defenders of Samaria.
I KINGS 20:19 So these young men of the governors of the provinces came out of
the city, and the army which followed them.
21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the
Syrians with a great slaughter.
The young men of the governors were the soldiers of the
pharaoh.
LETTER 129a: Who can stand against the soldiers of the king [pharaoh]?
Later on, when again pressed by the army of Damascus, the king
of Sumur ( Samaria) recalled this or a similar event:



LETTER 121: I have written to the palace: "Send archers." Have they not formerly
regained the lands for the king?
and similarly he wrote in another letter of that later period:
LETTER 132: Formerly Abdi-Ashirta opposed me, and I wrote to thy father: "Send
royal archers. And the whole land will be taken in (a few) days."
Once more he recalled this memorable event, and his words
accord with the story in the Scriptures:
LETTER 138: When Abdi-Ashrati conquered Sumurri, I protected the city by my own
hand. I had no garrison. But I wrote to the king, my lord, and soldiers came and they
took Sumuri.
1 I Kings 11:23-24.
2 The opponent of Ahab is generally regarded as a son of Ben-Hadad I, the adversary of
Baasha, and therefore is named Ben-Hadad II.
The Capture and Release of the King of Damascus by the King
of Samaria
One year after "the young men of the governors of the
provinces" freed Samaria from the siege, Ben-Hadad came once
more against the king of Israel and was met by the defenders on
the plain of Aphek. "The children of Israel pitched before them like
two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country" (I Kings
20:27).
The dread this army inspired arose from its multitude; we read in
the el-Amarna letters that it was composed of wild and irregular
troops. In the battle the Syrians were once more defeated, and Ben
Hadad fled to Aphek and hid. His servants said to him: "The kings
of the house of Israel are merciful kings; . . . go out to the king of
Israel." Then they "came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant
Ben-Hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet
alive? he is my brother. Now the men did diligently observe . . .
and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Ben-Hadad.
Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-Hadad came forth to



him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. And Ben
Hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy
father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in
Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will
send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with
him, and sent him away" (I Kings 20:31-34).
From this story we learn that Ben-Hadad was defeated and
captured but released; a covenant was concluded with him; the
Syrians had built a part of Samaria; there was a dispute between
the Syrians and the Israelites about a number of cities.
It appears that in the letters of the king of Sumur we have
references to all these events, some of which happened only a few
years before the date of the correspondence.
In the times of distress and oppression that came later, the king
of Sumur, remembering these better days, wrote to the pharaoh:
LETTER127: When, formerly, Abdi-Ashratu marched up against me, I was mighty;
but, behold, now my people are crushed . . .
Looking for help from the pharaoh against Azaru (Hazael), the
son of Abdi-Ashirta (Ben-Hadad 1 ), he recalled the capture of the
king of Damascus:
LETTER 117: If my words were regarded, then Azaru would truly be captured even as
his father.
Ben-Hadad was captured and released:
LETTER 117: Abdi-Ashirta, with all that belongs to him, was not (then) taken, as I
have said.
The treaty ("the covenant") with Ben-Hadad was made at a time
when the Syrian was defeated. A prophet, distressed by the
credulity of the king of Samaria, disguised himself as a wounded
warrior, stopped the king on the road, and said to him: ". . . thy life
shall go for his [Ben-Hadad's] life, and thy people for his people" (I
Kings 20:42).



This scriptural prophecy was fulfilled. We read the complaints of
the king of Sumur that he is oppressed by the king of Damascus,
whom he once released. He even contemplates a new covenant
with the king of Damascus, this time himself the humble partner:
LETTER 83: Why hast thou held back, so that thy land is taken? . . . I have written for
a garrison and for horses and they were not given. Send an answer to me. Otherwise I
will make a treaty with Abdi-Ashirta. . . . Then should I be rescued.
He was in the position of the once wretched king of Damascus,
who, when vanquished, asked for a treaty of peace.
The covenant, concluded after the battle of Aphek, which was
made in favor of Israel, endured for three years: "And they
continued three years without war between Syria and Israel" (I
Kings 22:1); then hostilities between Samaria and Damascus were
renewed. The war, which started with the siege of Samaria, was
continued at Aphek, and after a truce of three years, broke out
again at Ramoth-Gilead. Accordingly, the king of Sumur (Samaria)
wrote: "Three times, these years, has he [Abdi-Ashirta] opposed
me."2
1 That Hazael was a son of Ben-Hadad, see infra.
2 Letter 85.
Ships, Chieftains, or Legions?
In the el-Amarna letters a word recurs frequently which in some
places fits in the text and in others does not: it is the word elippe,
translated "a ship."
This translation is appropriate in the letter of the king of Tyre,
who wrote that the king of Beirut left in a ship, and in a letter of the
king of Sumur (Samaria), who asked that supplies be sent to him in
ships.
In the ninth century Palestine tried to maintain the maritime
traditions of the preceding century. Jehoshaphat ventured to repeat
Solomon's undertaking and built ships in Ezion-Geber on the



Aqaba Gulf of the Red Sea in order to send them "to Tarshish" (II
Chronicles 20:35f.), an enterprise that ended disastrously before it
had scarcely begun when a storm, so sudden in this gulf, smashed
the fleet. The Phoenician cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Beirut
maintained their maritime traffic down to a much later age. To
translate elippe as "ship" in the above examples is undoubtedly
correct. The reading "ships" might even be correct in connection
with an inland region of Palestine if there was at that time
navigation on the Jordan (as Strabo [XVI, 21 described it later), or
on the Sea of Galilee. But in some cases one finds ships traveling
on dry land, and performing other acts for which a vehicle of
transportation on water is not suited. For example, the elippe are
said to have penetrated into Amuru land and conspired with the
killers of Abdi-Ashirta.
In the Hebrew language there is a word ilpha (aleph, lamed,
phe) derived from the Syrian and meaning a "ship."1 An old
Hebrew word aluph ( also aleph, lamed, phe) means "a prince, lord
of a clan, head of a family."2 It seems to me that elippe in the el
Amarna letters must sometimes signify chieftain or the head of a
small tribe. One or another city mentioned in the el-Amarna letters
and presumed to be a harbor need not necessarily be a maritime
city or a lake city just because elippe arrived there and did
something. In these instances the word is misunderstood by
modern scholars, but they can be comforted by the fact that a
similar mistake was committed by the penman, who, in writing the
annals of this period, used old chronicles.
When Ben-Hadad with his captains fled from the battlefield of
Aphek into that city, a part of the city wall collapsed and "fell upon
twenty and seven thousand" men (I Kings 20:30). This sounds like
sheer exaggeration. Aphek was not such a large city, and tens of
thousands of persons would hardly be killed by a falling wall. Now
eleph (again aleph, lamed, phe) is "thousand,"3 and aluph is, as I
have mentioned, a "chieftain."



It will be remembered that in the description of the feudal
domains of the five chiefs of Jehoshaphat it was said that one had
under him three hundred thousand men of valor, a second, two
hundred and fourscore thousand, and so on. Although at the time
of David men available for conscription in Judah numbered five
hundred thousand, and in Israel eight hundred thousand,4 and one
century later Asa commanded over three hundred thousand from
Judah and two hundred and fourscore thousand from Benjamin,
nevertheless, it seems that the passage about the chiefs of
Jehoshaphat would better reflect the military might of the Palestine
princes of that age if it were read as follows: "Adnah the chief, and
with him mighty men of valour three hundred chieftains. And next
to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and
fourscore chieftains," and so on.
There is contemporaneous evidence that feudal domains were
reckoned by the number of chieftains or heads of communities.
Mesha wrote on his stele: "And the chiefs of Daibon were fifty, for
all Daibon was obedient (to me). And I reigned over a hundred (
chiefs) in the cities which I added to the land."
"Thousands" in the biblical story of the disaster at Aphek and
probably also in the passage about the chiefs of Jehoshaphat, and
"ships" in a number of the el-Amarna letters, must be revised, and
"chieftains" or "heads of communities" substituted, thus making the
passages in the letters and the Scriptures reasonable.
1 See Levy, Worterbuch iiber die Talrnudirn and Midrashim.
2 Ibid.
3 Sar-ha-eleph is a captain over a thousand. It might have been the origin of aiuph,
"chieftain."
4 II Samuel 24:9.
The King of Samaria Seeks an Ally Against the King of
Damascus
Because of one of the cities in dispute, the truce was broken.



I KINGS 22:3 And the Icing of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in
Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
The dispute over the cities of Israel, captured by the king of
Damascus, is recorded scores of times in the el-Amarna letters.
According to the Scriptures, in the beginning these cities were "Ijon,
and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the
land of Naphtali" (I Kings 15:20), "cities of Israel," which the king of
Damascus smote in days gone by. Later, other territory was added
to that gained by the king of Damascus.
"Abdi-Ashirta, the dog, he seeks to take all cities," wrote the king
of Sumur ( Samaria ).
LETTER 81: Let the king, my lord, know that powerful is the hostility of Abdi-Ashirta,
and that he has taken all my cities to himself.
The king of Sumur (Samaria) looked for an ally to recover these
lost cities. He thought that if one of the king-regents would side
with him he would be able to return blow for blow and expel the
bands of Syrians.
LETTER 85: If one regent would make common cause with me, then I would drive
Abdi-Ashirta out of Amurri.
I KINGS 22:4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to
Ramoth-Gilead?
At that time Governor Aman-appa was in Samaria. A prophet
admonished the kings of Jerusalem and Samaria not to go to war
against the king of Damascus. The prophet was turned over to the
governor (I Kings 22:36).
King Jehoshaphat, at the beginning of his reign, strengthened
himself against Israel: "And he placed forces in all the fenced cities
of Judah . . . and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had
taken" (II Chronicles 17:2). Later he concluded peace with Israel
and agreed to join Ahab in his campaign against the king of
Damascus at Ramoth-Gilead. He felt that the Syrian was growing
too strong and that the day might come when he would threaten
Jerusalem too. Possibly, also, he wished to make amends for the sin



of his father Asa, who had called the king of Damascus to his
assistance when defending his land against Baasha of Israel.
The two kings joined forces and met their enemy at Ramoth
Gilead. In the course of the battle a chance arrow struck King
Ahab.
Ahab or Jehoram: Two Versions of the Scriptures
With the story of this first battle of Ramoth-Gilead we reach the
period during which the el-Amarna letters were written. The king
who wrote more than sixty of the extant letters called himself - if
the reading is correct - Rib-Addi. Was their author the scriptural
Ahab or Jehoram, Ahab's son? They were written in the latter part
of Jehoshaphat's reign in Jerusalem, and their contents accord with
the events of that time.
According to the more expanded version of the story in the
Scriptures, Ahab died from the wound he received in the battle at
Ramoth-Gilead; Ahaziah, his son, followed him on the throne of
Israel, reigning for two years; after the death of Ahaziah, Jehoram,
his brother, reigned. The less amplified but probably older version
in the Scriptures implies that Ahab was apparently only wounded
at Ramoth-Gilead and reigned nine years longer.
The beginning of the reign of Jehoram in Israel is recorded in
two contradictory statements:
II KINGS 1:17 And Jehoram reigned in his [Ahaziah's] stead in the second year of
Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.
II KINGS 3:1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in
the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat of Judah.1
Jehoshaphat ruled for twenty-five years.2 The difference in these
two statements consists of nine years: the last seven years of
Jehoshaphat and the first two years of his son's reign.3 The
inconsistent records of course presented difficulties to chronologists
and exegetes. The question under discussion, which was only a



chronological difficulty, becomes a problem of importance for the
study of Palestinian history in the period of the el-Amarna letters,
for it was during these nine years that the major part of the letters
was written.
The problem, it should be made clear, does not result from a
comparison of the Scriptures with the el-Amarna letters, but from
the divergencies in the scriptural texts. The el-Amarna letters will
have to help in clarifying the question at issue.
If, during the last seven years of the reign of King Jehoshaphat,
Jehoram reigned in Israel, it would also be he who wrote the sixty
five letters preserved in the el-Amarna archives. But if the other
version of the Second Book of Kings is correct, and during the last
seven years of King Jehoshaphat's reign King Ahab still reigned in
Israel, then he must have been the author of the letters and the
events of these seven or nine years must have occurred in his time.
Ahab, dying one or two years after Jehoshaphat, would have met
with the experiences ascribed to his son Jehoram. He would not
have died at the hand of one of Ben-Hadad's archers but would
only have been wounded and would have survived Ben-Hadad.
Similarly the rebellion of Mesha, king of Moab, would not have
taken place after the death of Ahab but after his defeat at Ramoth
Gilead.
The description of the battle at Ramoth-Gilead gives one the
feeling that the hand of a later scribe tried to mingle different
sources. Having been wounded by an archer, Ahab "said unto the
driver of his chariot: Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the
host; for I am wounded." This indicates that the wounded Ahab
abandoned the field of battle. But the next passage contradicts this:
"And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in
his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran
out of the wound into the midst of the chariot" (I Kings 22).
This story closes a chapter of the drama known as the crime of
Ahab, whose wife, Jezebel, gave him the vineyard of Naboth
adjacent to his palace in Jezreel to build there a garden of herbs.
When Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard to take possession



of it, Elijah the Tishbite came to meet him there. And Ahab said to
Elijah: "Hast thou found me, 0 mine enemy?" And the feared man
answered: "I have found thee. . . . Hast thou killed and also taken
possession? . . . In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth
shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. The dogs shall eat Jezebel by
the wall of Jezreel" (I Kings 21).
In accordance with this curse, after the battle of Ramoth-Gilead "
one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked
up his [Ahab's] blood; and they washed his armour; according unto
the word of the Lord which he spake" (I Kings 22).
But the story of the meeting of the seer with the king had a
sequel. When Ahab heard the words of the prophet he rent his
clothes and put sackcloth on his body, and fasted and went softly.
And Elijah the Tishbite heard the word of the Lord: "Seest thou
how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth
himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his
son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."
And what about the pardon? Ahab humbled himself, and the
misfortune fated for his lifetime was postponed to the next
generation. But in spite of this did the evil overtake him?
The effort of the scribe to unify the diverse elements was
unsuccessful, as there are inconsistencies in the text. This editor of
the Books of Kings was helpless in the face of two different
versions, and while giving preference to the tradition that Jehoram
was king in Israel during the last seven years of Jehoshaphat, he
did not suppress the other version, but in describing the history of
the period, he evaded the issue by writing in a number of chapters
the impersonal and indefinite "king of Israel."4
Already in the story of the battle at Ramoth-Gilead, every time
the king of Jerusalem is referred to, he is called by name,
Jehoshaphat, but the king of Samaria is referred to fifteen times as
"king of Israel": "And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat," "And the
king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat"; in the body of the story the
name of Ahab is not mentioned.



Again, in the war against Moab, the king of Jerusalem is repeat
edly called by name, but not the "king of Israel": "So the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat . . ." Only the introductory remark informs
us that Jehoram is intended. In the story of Naaman's healing there
is but the recurrent "king of Israel" and no name; neither does the
story of attempts against the life of the "king of Israel" contain his
name. In the long story of the second siege of Samaria, when the
king met the mother who killed her child, and in the story of the
rescue from this siege, not once does the name of the king
accompany the phrase icing of Israel." This is singular in the Books
of Kings and Chronicles.
A contemporaneous source, which may shed light on the matter,
is the stele of King Mesha of Moab. On the stele it is engraved that
Omri, king of Israel, oppressed Moab many days, and "his son
succeeded him; and he also said, 'I will afflict Moab' In my days
said he thus." Then follows:
Omri took possession of the land of Medeba and (Israel) dwelt therein, during his days
and half his son's days, forty years; but Chemosh restored it in my days.5
Here is an event of importance ascribed to the reign of Ahab,
son of Omri, according to one source (the stele of Mesha), and to
the reign of Jehoram, son of Ahab, according to another source,
one of the two scriptural versions.
The Second Book of kings opens with these words: "Then Moab
rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab." This contradicts the
stele of Mesha, which says that Mesha rebelled when Omri's son,
had reigned only half his years.
If Ahab was not killed, but only wounded, at Ramoth-Gilead, the
defeat having been a signal for the rebellion of Moab, the
expression, "and half the days of his [Oinri's] son," would accord
with the version that Ahab reigned during the time otherwise
allotted to Jehoram.
Besides the fact that the rebellion of Mesha took place not after
the death of Ahab but in the middle of his reign, the figure of forty



years for the reign of Omri and half of the reign of his son conflicts
with the scriptural account. Forty years of oppression of Moab may
be taken as a rough figure, forty being the measure of a generation,
or a period of time, similar to our counting by centuries; but the
account must correspond approximately to the time passed; it
would suggest a longer reign for Omri and Ahab or for one of
them.6
It is recorded that Omri reigned twelve years over Israel, six of
them in Tirzah (I Kings 16:23), and that Ahab reigned twenty-two
years in Samaria (I Kings 16:29). Either the reign of Ahab started
later than recorded or it lasted longer. Since it is said of his father,
Omri, that "six years reigned he in Tirzah" but for twelve years he
reigned over Israel, it is clear that the last six years he reigned in his
new capital Samaria (Shemer). Similarly the twenty-two years of
Ahab's reign in Samaria may refer to his reign in that capital alone,
the years of his reign in his new capital Jezreel not being
mentioned.
In one of his last letters the king of Sumur ( Samaria) wrote of
himself to Pharaoh Akhnaton:
LETTER 137: Behold, I cannot come to the lands of Egypt. I am old, and my body is
afflicted with a severe disease.
Ahab could have said that he was old; not so a second son of his
in the first part of his reign.
The inscription of King Shalmaneser of Assyria-Babylonia, like
the stele of Mesha, conflicts with the same version of the Scriptures.
Shalmaneser wrote that in his sixth year he battled a coalition of
Syrian and Palestinian princes at Karkar. Among the princes Ahab
is mentioned; he delivered an army of ten thousand soldiers and
two thousand chariots to the allied host.7 In the eighteenth year of
his reign Shalmaneser wrote that he received "a tribute of the men
of Tyre, Sidon, and of Jehu, of the house of Omri."8
During the twelve years between the sixth and the eighteenth
year of Shalmaneser's reign, the reign of Ahab had to come to an



end, Ahaziah had to reign two years, Jehoram twelve years, and
Jehu had to reign for some undefined period. But even if Ahab
had died right after the battle of Karkar,9 and Jehu's tribute
mentioned in the inscription were paid immediately after he seized
the throne, there would still not be twelve years left for Jehoram's
reign. The Mesha stele thus requires the extension of Ahab's reign,
and the inscription of Shalmaneser requires shortening of
Jehoram's reign so as to bring Ahab closer to Jehu.
Under the circumstances described, a hypothesis may be
formulated, and the very existence of Jehoram, king of Israel, may
be questioned.10
What could have misled the annalist into calling the son of Ahab
by the name of Jehoram? Jehoram was a son of Jehoshaphat and
the son-in-law of Ahab (II Chronicles 21:6). Obviously it was
Jehoshaphat's policy to establish good relations with Israel through
this alliance; he probably hoped to unite the kingdom under his
son Jehoram and Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel.
Jehoshaphat visited Samaria and allied himself with Ahab in his
military undertakings.
Ahab is said to have been killed at Ramoth-Gilead. Jehoram, his
son, is said to have been wounded also at Ramoth-Gilead, under
similar circumstances, with the king of Judah again an ally in the
battle (II Kings 8:28). Many other details ascribed to the reigns of
these two kings of Israel bear the mark of confusing similarity.
The annalist placed an Ahaziah and a Jehoram in Israel and an
other Jehoram and another Ahaziah in Judah. The state of things
as he found them in older chronicles was probably confusing.
Possibly Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, acted as a regent,
succeeding Ahab, his father-in-law, and Ahaziah, son of Ahab, who
died after a short reign and a long illness. Of Jehoram it is said:
"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the
house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife."11
Thereafter the throne of Israel was seized by Jehu, and Jehoram
was killed, together with Ahaziah of Judah. Ahab's daughter



Athaliah, wife of Jehoram, seized the throne of Jerusalem when her
husband and son were killed.
Following the description of the assassination of Jehoram and
Ahaziah by Jehu, the Second Book of Kings relates: "And Ahab
had seventy sons in Samaria." Jehu sent letters to the elders of
Samaria with the challenge: "Look even out the best and meetest
of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne." The king
who is called here "your master" was Ahab, not Jehoram, son of
Ahab, and one of his ( Ahab's) sons should have succeeded him,
had it not been for the massacre in which all his sons perished. This
also would explain Ahab's reign extending almost until the rebellion
of Jehu.
On subsequent pages it will be shown that rumors of Ahab's
death were spread while he was still alive. A later annalist might
well be misled if contemporaries were mistaken.
Regardless of whether this hypothesis concerning Jehoram is
correct or incorrect, the documents of Mesha, of Shalmaneser, and
of el-Amarna unanimously support the version of the Scriptures ac
cording to which Ahab was alive during the last seven years of
Jehoshaphat's reign.
In the contest between the two versions of the Book of Kings, all
three non-scriptural sources testify in favor of the minor version
and against the prevailing text; the rendering of II Kings 1:17 must
be looked upon as the correct one. This would mean that Ahab
died not before but after Jehoshaphat, which would signify that the
king-author of more than sixty of the preserved clay tablets was
Ahab and no one else.
1 See also II Kings 8:16.
2 II Chronicles 20:31.
3 The same discrepancy of nine years exists in the records of the reigns of Baasha and Asa.
4 The annals (the Books of Kings and Chronicles) were composed during and after the
Exile in Babylon, since the Exile is narrated in Chronicles and the return from the Exile in
Kings. The editor of Kings indicated that his work was a compilation by referring to "the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel," which seems to have been a larger work than
the canonical Chronicles. Also, the books of the prophets Nathan, Iddo, and others (not



extant at the time when the Scriptures were revised and canonized) are referred to in the
annals.

9 "Within these thirteen years, 854-842, must fall the death of Ahab, the reigns of Ahaziah
and Jehoram, and the' accession of Jehu. There appears to be no time left for Ahab after
854. The death of Ahab, however, cannot be assigned to so early a date as 854." K. Marti

10 "It seems problematic that Ahab, who persecuted the cult of Yahwe, would have called
his son Jehoram (Jahwe is exalted). This would be a forceful argument but for the fact that
the scriptural names of Ahab's other children, Ahaziah, Joash, and Athaliah - invite the
same question.

Chapter VII
THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS
(CONTINUED)
Famine
Tribes of the desert, driven by famine, came to Trans-Jordan and
crossed the river, only to find the land of Israel in even greater
distress and misery than that from which they had fled. The fields
in Israel yielded nothing. The meadows were scorched by the sun;
only thorns sprang from the barren land.
The first forecast of the drought came from Elijah the Tishbite,
who said to the king:
I KINGS 17:1 . . . there shall not be dew nor rain these years.
The heavens breathed heat, the trees in the field withered. The
brook Cherith, where the prophet looked for a little water, dried up
like other brooks.
I KINGS 17:7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because
there had been no rain in the land.
Eager eyes were turned skyward, looking to see whether a cloud
would appear. The prophet said that his blessing on the poor
widow should last "until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon
the earth= (I Kings 17 :14) .
Unlike Egypt, which is dependent on a river, 1 Palestine's
harvest depends solely on rain; the drought brought the famine.
I KINGS 17:2 And there was a sore famine in Samaria.



It was a time of hunger and starvation unparalleled in the history
of the period of the kings of Israel. The want lasted seven years.
I KINGS 8:1 . . . the Lord hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the
land seven years.
This famine overshadowed all other events of that time; the
mark of hunger was impressed on the entire period. A succession
of chapters in the Scriptures describes the famine. During those
years the el-Amarna letters were written, and it would be
inconceivable that they should not reflect these conditions. The fact
is that the letters of el-Amarna written by the king of Sumur
(Samaria) are as eloquent as the Book of Kings.
The famine was so great that children were sold for bread.
LETTER 74: Our sons and our daughters have come to an end, together with
ourselves, because they are given in Iarimuta for the saving of our lives. My field is a
wife, who is without a husband, deficient in cultivation.
After the sons and the daughters had been sold into slavery to
save them and the remnants of the population from starvation, the
implements of the households also went in exchange for food.
LETTER 75: The sons, the daughters, have come to an. end, and the wooden
implements of the houses, because they are given in Iarirnuta for the saving of our
lives.
The king repeated his comparison of a land without seed to a
woman deserted by her husband; he was to repeat it in many
letters. In more than thirty places in his letters the king of Sumur
(Samaria) writes of the distress of the famine or pleads for
provisions for the population or the army.
LETTER 79: Give me something to feed them [the archers], I have nothing.
LETTER 83: . . . Give grain for my provision.
LETTER 85: There is no grain for our support. What shall I say to my peasants? Their
sons, their daughters have come to an end. . . . Send grain in ships and preserve the
life of his servant and his city. May it seem good to the king, my lord, that grain be
given, produce of the land of Iarimuta.



LETTER 86: There is nothing to give for deliverance. . . . And from the land of
Iarimuta should grain be given for our nourishment.
Grain received from Iarimuta in exchange for the freedom of
a part of the people was rationed and divided in scanty portions
among the peasants. (As to the whereabouts of Iarimuta, the reader
will be instructed in a later section.)
We see the turn of the years:
LETTER 85: Two years I measure my grain.
LETTER 86: I measure our grain three years already.
LETTER 90: My field is deficient in cultivation . . . and I measure my grain.
LETTER 91: I measure my grain.
The indication in the Scriptures that the famine endured for
seven years ( II Kings 8:1) corresponds to the impression received
from these letters; after the third year of the drought the famine still
was constantly recalled, although on the basis of the letters alone
we cannot calculate the time precisely. The clue of the seven years
helps to establish a timetable for some of the letters of el-Amarna.
The springs and wells dried up; a prince from the north, an ally
of the king of Egypt, intended to come to the help of Sumur
(Samaria).
LETTER 85: . . . but there was no water for him to drink, and so he has returned to
his land.
The lack of water is described in the story of the brook that dried
up after rainless seasons (I Kings 17:7); the passage was quoted
above. The king of Israel, who undertook an expedition against
Mesha, was in a bad plight, because "there was no water for the
host, and for the cattle that followed them" (II Kings 3:9). "And
there was a dearth in the land" (II Kings 4:38). In the letter of the
king of Babylon we read: "The road [to Egypt] is very long, the
water supply cut off, and the weather hot."2
This drought and the anxiety of the king of Israel are equally
reflected in that part of the story where he said to Obadiah, the



governor of his house:
I KINGS 18: 5-6 . . . Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all
brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we
lose not all the beasts.
So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it . . .
A quotation from a letter written to the pharaoh by a man of
Gubla, but not by the king himself, may lead us to a conjecture
about the author of the letter. After reporting on political affairs, the
writer referred to his care of the asses:
LETTERS 94: Formerly, in respect to the asses, the king has commanded that they be
given to his faithful servant. But, verily, he has now nothing . . .
The name of the author at the beginning of the letter is
destroyed. It might have been Obadiah, a man who would have
the prerogative to write to the pharaoh, and who was charged with
the care of the animals. The man who, together with Ahab, king of
Samaria, was concerned that "we lose not all the beasts," reported
to the Egyptian sovereign that no asses survived the famine and
the drought.
The plague among the animals in Samaria is mentioned in a
letter written from Egypt by a chief; he had heard that the people
of Sumura were not allowed to enter Gubla, since in Sumura there
was a plague.
LETTERS 96: What sort of a plague is among the asses?
Outside of Samaria, as in the capital, the population was
starving. The icing brought the riches of the realm, together with
the children sold into slavery "for the saving of the life," to a place
called Iarimuta, in order to take grain from there; the list of the
treasures exists in part. But the king did not get the grain, for the
ruler of the region from which it was to be sent apparently allied
himself with Damascus.
The dreadful seven years' famine left deep marks. A thousanu
years later the rabbinical Haggada related: "In the first year
everything stored in the houses was eaten up. In the second, the



people supported themselves with what they could scrape together
in the fields. The flesh of the clean animals sufficed for the third
year; in the fourth the sufferers resorted to the unclean animals; in
the fifth, to the reptiles and insects; and in the sixth the monstrous
thing happened that women, crazed by hunger, consumed their
own children as food. . . . In the seventh year, men sought to gnaw
the flesh from their own bones."3
The contemporaneous letters of the king of Sumur (Samaria)
reflect the agony of those years. He wrote of his futile efforts to
obtain grain for sustenance from Iarimuta "that I die not."4 Again
he wrote: "Everything is consumed,"5 and again: "Everything is
gone,"6 and the king had nothing to give to his people, no grain for
bread and no seed to try for a crop the next year.
The king wrote that he had no provisions for his peasants,7 that
he was afraid of them,8 that they would rebe1,9 that they intended
to desert: "My peasants intend to desert,"10 and that his land was
waste and the peasants were departing for places where grain was
to be found:
LETTER 125: And there is no grain for my provisions, and the peasants have
departed for the cities where there is grain for their provisions.
This emigration is reflected in II Kings 8:1:
Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn:
for the Lord hash called for a famine.
It is significant that in the Scriptures and in the letters the years
long famine is localized in the land of Samaria (Sumur).
The shortest record - short because only a few words remain of it
on a mutilated tablet - speaks most eloquently:
dust . . . yield . . . of the lands.

Mesha's Rebellion
Mesha, king of Moab, paid tribute to the king of Israel: "And Mesha
icing of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of
Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams,
with the wool" (II Kings 3:4).
After the defeat at Ramoth-Gilead, Moab rebelled against the
king of Israel (II Kings 1:1 and 3:5). The allied armies of Israel,
Judah, and Edom suffered greatly from lack of water on their
march around the Dead Sea to bring the king of Moab to
obedience. They reached Moab from the south and wrought
destruction upon the land. The king of Moab tried to break through
the siege but could not. "Then he took his eldest son that should
have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering
upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and
they departed from him, and returned to their own land" (II Kings
3:27).
It is evident that Israel was defeated and that its allies could not
help. We are not given any details of that "great indignation."
In the sixties of the last century Arabs of Dhiban in Trans-Jordan,
the ancient Dibon, showed a traveler a black basalt stele on which
were cut ancient Hebrew characters. After the stone had been sold
to a museum the Arabs regretted the transaction. They began to
think that a treasure was hidden inside the stone and that the
strange writing told of it, and so they decided to open the stone.



Furthermore, they reasoned that by breaking it up they would have
more objects for sale. And if the stone possessed a charm they had
to destroy it first. They heated it in fire and poured cold water over
it, and it broke into many pieces.
A young scholar, however, had previously succeeded in secretly
having a cast of the stone made by an Arab. Later the broken
basalt in a very defective condition was purchased for the Louvre
Museum. The cast supplies the missing parts, but all together it is
only the upper part of the stele. The stone, which at the time of its
discovery was estimated to be the oldest inscription in Hebrew
characters in the hands of the archaeologists, established the fact
that the Moabites used Hebrew.









Plate IX: THE MESHA STELE



The text gives an account of Mesha's victory over Israel. It opens
with these words:
"I am Mesha, son of Chemosh, king of Moab, the Daibonite
[Dabonite]1 . My father reigned over Moab for thirty years, and I
reigned after my father. And I made this high place for Chemosh in
KRKHH, a high place of salvation, because he had saved me from
all the assailants, and because he had let me see my desire upon all
them that hated me.
"Omri, king of Israel, afflicted Moab for many days, because
Chemosh was angry with his land. And his son succeeded him;
and he also said, I will afflict Moab. In my days said he thus; but I
saw my desire upon him and upon his house, and Israel perished
with an everlasting destruction."2
Mesha recorded that he restored Medeba; built Baal-Meon and
Kiryathen; fought against Ataroth, the dwelling place of Gad from
of old, fortified by the king of Israel, and slew all the people of that
city. The oracle of Chemosh told him, "Go, take Nebo against
Israel," and he took it and slew all that were in it, seven thousand
men and boys and women and girls and maidservants. "And the
king of Israel had built Yahas, and abode in it, while he fought
against me. But Chemosh drave him out from before me; and I
took . . . it to add it unto Daibon." Then Mesha built and repaired
the walls and palace in Karkhah with the slave labor of the
prisoners of Israel, and it is recounted in more detail; he also built
other places. He continued with the war and went against the
Israelite city of Horonen, and here the record is interrupted; the
lines are defaced, but it may be presumed that other war exploits
against Israel were recorded. "And I" can be read a few more times.
The lower part of the stele is missing altogether. The cities
mentioned on the stele are in Trans-Jordan, but Karkhah is not
known.
Every word and every letter and every obliterated portion were
objects of careful examination: the stele of Mesha is regarded as
the greatest single discovery in biblical archaeology, especially as it



provides a parallel record to a scriptural narrative.
The Book of Kings relates that "there was great indignation
against Israel" at the attempt to subjugate Moab, which rebelled; on
what form this indignation took, the record is silent. The Book of
Chronicles discloses that the Moabites, together with the Am
monites, invaded Palestine with the help of the Syrians. From the
Mesha stele we know that Mesha, king of Moab, took his revenge
by an "everlasting destruction" of Israel, and that Mehedeba,
Ataroth, Nebo, and Yahas were retaken. The "everlasting
destruction" is not to be seen merely in the recapture of four or five
not very significant places in Trans-Jordan.
The cuneiform letters of el-Amarna, found twenty years after the
discovery of the Mesha stele, are regarded as historical documents
preceding the stele of Mesha by some five hundred and fifty years,
and relating to the Canaanite period. The present research shows
that the documents are contemporaneous, having been written in
the middle of the ninth century.
In letters from Palestine, and especially in those written by the
king of Samaria, we should expect to find direct reference to the
rebellion of Mesha. We should also expect to find mention of
events, the record of which was carved on the lower, missing part
of the stele of Mesha. And, in fact, the letters of el-Amarna bear
extensive witness to the history of that war, and also give us
material with which to reconstruct roughly the missing part of the
stele.
Already in the earliest preserved letter of the king of Sumur
(Samaria) he had written to the pharaoh (Amenhotep III):
LETTER 68: Let the king, my lord, know . . . the hostility of the sa-gaz-Mesh troops is
very great against me. So let not the king, my lord, hold back from Sumur that it be
not quite annexed to the sa-gaz-Mesh troops.
In the translations of the el-Amarna letters we find sa-gaz-Mesh
rendered as "sa-gaz-people." Putting these words into English, sa
gaz, which ideographically can also be read "habatu," is translated
"plunderers" or "cutthroats" or "rebellious bandits." "Mesh" is



understood as the suffix of the plural. It is met with in the letters
scores of times, always in connection with the plundering rebels.
Sometimes the intruding pillagers are called amelut sa-gaz-Mesh,
amelut being the men or the people; sometimes the text speaks of
gaz-Mesh as of a single person, and the translators again neglect
"Mesh" and translate "robber." "He takes thy cities the Amal-gaz
Mesh, the dog," and the words are rendered "the gaz man," Mesh
being dropped. But the text speaks in these cases of a single
person, and therefore Mesh cannot here be the suffix for the plural.
I shall not translate Mesh either, because it is the personal name
of King Mesha, but I shall not omit it from the text of the
translation. Thus we shall read: "The hostility of the rebels
[pillagers] of Mesh is very great against me"; and in the other
sentence: "He takes thy cities, the rebel Mesh, the dog."3
According to the inscription on the stele of Mesha, the revolt took
place in the middle of Ahab's reign. As the earlier letters of the king
of Sumur mention this rebellion, we are already in the second part
of the reign of Ahab.
In another letter of the early years of the el-Amarna
correspondence, the king of Sumur (Samaria) wrote again:
LETTER 69: Behold, now they rise up day and night in rebellions against me.
Ambi, a geographical name referred to in connection with the
rebellion of Mesh,4 seems to be the name of the land of Moab or its
capital, or its people. Possibly Ammi, repeatedly mentioned in
connection with Ambi, is Ammon;5 in Genesis (19:38) the
Ammonites are called Ammi. A city named Rubute also appears;
this must be Rabbath-Ammon, the capital.6
The king of Sumur (Samaria) wrote to a dignitary in Egypt:
LETTER 73: When he [Abdi-Ashirta] wrote to the people of Ammia"Kill your lord,"
and they joined the amelut-gaz [pillagers], then said the regents: "Thus will he do to
us." And so all lands will join with the amelut-gaz [pillagers].
The Ammonites, their king having been killed, joined the
herdsmen on the fields of Moab.



"There cometh a great multitude" of "the children of Moab, and
the children of Ammon, and with them other[s] beside the
Ammonites," was reported to King Jehoshaphat (II Chronicles
20:1-2).
The king of Sumur wrote:
LETTER 79: Know that since the arrival of Aman-appa to me all amelut-gaz-Mesh
[the people of the bandit Mesh] have directed their face against me, in accordance
with the demand of Abdi-Ashirta. Let my lord listen to the words of his servant, and let
him send me a garrison to defend the city of the king, until the march of the archers.
And if there are no archers then all lands will unite with amelut-gaz-Mesh [the people
of the bandit Mesh].
What is generally surmised from the records of the Books of
Kings and Chronicles - the bidden hand of the king of Damascus in
the rebellion of Moab7 and in the turmoil among the tribes of the
desert - grows to certainty in face of these letters. The king of
Sumur (Samaria) asked that horses and infantry be sent him "so
that he jAbdi-Ashirtal might not assemble all the bandits of Mesh."8
Letters are rare in which the king of Sumur (Samaria) does not
mention the revolt of Mesha and the role which the ruler of
Damascus played in it, whether openly or secretly. The role of
Damascus in the war between Samaria and Moab may be read
also in the Second Book of Chronicles (20:1-2).

The "Great Indignation": A Reconstruction of the Obscure and
Missing Portions of the Stele of Mesha
"The city of the king, my lord," Sumur (Samaria ), was threatened
by the "bandits" or "cutthroats" of Mesh (Mesha). Already in the
earliest extant letters of the king of Sumur the pharaoh was warned
that the rebels were endangering the capital. Then he was warned
that "the land of the king and Sumur, your garrison town," would
unite with the people of the rebel Mesh (amel-gaz-Mesh), and
"thou held back."1 The king of Sumur asked for archers, making it
clear that he was unable to defend his land against the troops of
the rebel Mesh.2 The help did not come. So he wrote again:
LETTER 83: Listen to me. Why hast thou held back, so that thy land is taken? Let it
not be said: "In the days of the princes amulet-gaz-Mesh [the people of the rebel Mesh]
have taken all lands." Let not such things be said in future days. "And thou wast not
able to rescue it" . . . if Sumura and Bit-Arkha also are now lost . . .
In the days when this letter was written Sumur ( Samaria) was
only threatened. Another stern warning came in a letter from the
king of Sumur: If the pharaoh will not listen to the words he writes
to him, then
LETTER 88: . . . all the lands of the king, even as far as Egypt, will unite with amelut
gaz-Mesh [people of the rebel Mesh].
Finally it becomes clear that with the help of the king of
Damascus the troops of Mesha entered Samaria ( Sumur ).
LETTER 91: Why dost thou sit and hold back, so that he takes thy cities amel-gaz
Mesh [the rebel Mesh], the dog? When he had taken Sumura . . .
The king of Sumur, his capital lost, looked desperately for help
from Egypt and asked the pharaoh in the same letter:



LETTER 91: So mayest thou give a thousand minas of silver and one hundred minas
of gold. Then will he [the rebel Mesh] depart from me. And he has taken all my cities .
..
We know from the Scriptures that the king of Samaria ( Sumur)
had negotiated to free his capital from a siege by the payment of
silver and gold; it was during the first siege of Samaria described in
I Kings 20. He was told then: "Thou shalt deliver me thy silver and
thy gold. . . ."
With all the information that the el-Amarna letters provide now
in hand and properly read, we are faced with the surprising fact
that the rebel Mesha of Moab succeeded in entering Samaria.
The first thought that presents itself is this: we have only the
upper portion of the stele of Mesha; in the lower lost portion "the
everlasting destruction" or the "great indignation" (II Kings 3:27)
were probably described. It is also possible that the Mesha stele
may have been but one part of a twin inscription on two
monoliths, each of which carried half the story.
That we have only the top portion of the stele is evident; that
there were two steles is not impossible. In any event we have to
reexamine the stele of Mesha, and in doing this, it may be that we
shall see things to which we paid insufficient attention before.
After the capture of the city of Yahas the king of Moab, at war
with Israel, turned to building activities in an unidentified place:
"I built KRKHH [Karkhah], the wall of Yearim [or of the Forests],
and the wall of Ophel. And I built its gates, and I built its towers.
And I built the king's palace, and I made the two reservoirs for
water in the midst of the city. And there was no cistern in the midst
of the city, in Karkhah. And I said to all the people: 'Make you
every man a cistern in his house.' And I cut out the cuttings for
Karkhah with (the help of) prisoners of Israel."
There is no city known by the name of Karkhah. Some scholars
have thought that it was a portion of the city of Dibon. Another
conjecture was that it represents the city of Kir-ha-Kharoshet. For
some reason mention of this building activity in Karkhah is the



central theme of this stele, and this, together with the reference to
Karkhah in the introductory passage, lends emphasis to the
importance of the activities there during the war against the
Israelites.
With the help of the el-Amarna letters it may be assumed that
KRKHH was the capital of the entire Egyptian domain in Palestine,
or Sumur (Samaria), which Mesha, the rebel, entered after his
success in overcoming the resistance of the fortified cities to the
east. Samaria - on a straight line - is about twenty miles from the
Jordan, the border of Ammon.
Kerakh or Kharkah is in Hebrew "a very large city, encircled by a
wall, to which foreigners come yearly for trade purposes,"3 that is, a
metropolis.4
According to the inscription of Mesha, in Karkhah there was
"Ophel," the wall of which he built or repaired. In the Scriptures a
part of the city called "Ophel" is mentioned only with respect to
Jerusalem and Samaria. Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, "the prophet
that is in Samaria," returning to the house of his master with the
presents from Naaman, parted from the servants of the sar when
they reached Ophel in the city of Samaria (II Kings 5:24).
Reference to Ophel in Karkhah on the stele of Mesha is of
unquestionable value.
The king's palace (beth-melech), so often mentioned in the el
Amarna letters as being in Sumur, and unearthed in the Samaria of
Omri and Ahab (Sebastieh of today), is also spoken of as being in
Karkhah or the metropolis of the Mesha stele.
The attitude of Mesha in conquering the capital, "the city of the
king [pharaoh]," was characteristic indeed. He repaired the city, its
palace, and its walls. In his estimation it did not belong to the king
of Israel. It belonged to the pharaoh. Whoever built in it showed his
peaceful attitude toward Egypt, and also acquired the right to be
regarded as the senior among the vassal princes of Syria-Palestine.
In other letters, written from northern Syria, it is said that the
following places, possibly outside the domain of Israel, were de



spoiled by the rebels of Mesh ( Mesha ): Mahzibti, Giluni, Magdali,
and Uste, also Tahsi and Ubi.5
Like a turbulent wind, the Arabs attacked the land from all
directions. The peasants on the plains of the coast, hungry and
thirsty, joined the troops of rebellious tribes driving across the land.
A ransom was probably paid to Mesh (Mesha) for releasing
Sumur (Samaria), and if so, it was apparently paid out of the
Egyptian treasury, as the Egyptian king saw in Samaria a palace
city of his own.
The stele was prepared to be erected in Karkhah-Samaria, but
was left in Dibon. The vassal triumphed over his lord and the lord
of his lord and probably received a ransom. This is what was
meant by the "great indignation" of the biblical text and the
"everlasting destruction" of the Mesha stele.
Or did the help dispatched by governor Aman-appa arrive in
time and the oppressors of Samaria depart without ransom, as in
the story of I Kings 20?

4 This well-known word is written with two khaf letters; in the inscription of Mesha the
letters are khuf and heth, the other characters for k and kh. But in the same inscription of
Mesha the word "city" is kar, written also with khuf, and it is probable that the original
writing of Kerakh and Karkhah with khuf is correct, being derived from kar, the city. Kat for
city is of Carian origin. Similarly, today we write both "Carians" and "Karians."
5 Letters 185 and 189.
Arza, the Courtier
The king of Damascus followed the troops of the rebel Mesh and
marched once again toward the city of Samaria ( Sumur ), left in
ruins by wars and sieges and deserted by most of her inhabitants
because of the famine, and entered it. He wrote to the pharaoh:



LETTER 60: Behold, I am a servant of the king and a dog of his house, and the
whole land of Amurri I guard for the king, my lord. , . . Behold, all kings of the king
seek selected troops to snatch the lands from my hand . . . If my plenipotentiary brings
life from the king, the sun, then I shall reap the grain of Sumur, and I shall guard all
lands for the king, my sun, my lord.
He had an excuse for entering Sumur, the excuse of one who
insists on protecting a city that does not want his protection: he
"delivered it from the'hands of the troops of Sehlal." "There were no
people in Sumur to protect it." If it had not been for him, "the
troops of Sehlal would now have burned with fire Sumur and her
palace." That these troops were incited by him he did not say.
He wrote to a chief in Egypt:
LETTER 62: But when I hurried up here . . . and came to Sumur, the people were not
there, who had dwelt in her palace; then, behold, the people, who dwelt in her palace,
were Sabi-ilu, Bisitanu, Maia, and Arzaia. Behold, only four people there were, who
dwelt in her palace, and they said to me: "Deliver us out of the hand of the troops of
Sehlal," and I delivered them out of the hand of the troops of Sehlal. . . . What lies did
the regents tell thee? And thou believest them.
One of the four persons who remained in the palace in Samaria,
when it was entered by the king of Damascus, was called Arzaia.
Probably it was the same old courtier, the dweller in palaces, who
is familiar to us from the First Book of Kings. There he is called
Arza.
It was a few decades earlier that Elah, the son of Baasha, after a
reign of two years, was killed by Zimri, a captain, when the young
king was "drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of
his house" (I Kings 16:9). Since then twelve years of Omri's reign
and a number of years of Ahab's reign had passed. Arza, as always,
enjoyed the air of palace life.
From the Scriptures we know only of two sieges of Samaria and
nothing of her fall. But we read that when the king of Samaria had
allowed the vanquished Ben-Hadad to go in peace with a covenant
of brotherhood, a prophet told the king: "Because thou hast let go
out of thy hand a man appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy
life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people" (I Kings



20:42). In these words is disguised the story we read in the letters
of the king of Sumur.
LETTER 74: Behold, now, the king [the pharaoh] has let his faithful city go out of his
hand . . . Mighty is the hostility of the gaz-people [bandits] against me.
In passing, it may be noted that the turn of speech, let go out of
the hand," used in the scriptural text, is repeated in this letter.
Jerusalem in Peril
From the hills surrounding Jerusalem the mountains of Moab are
distinctly seen in the clear air over the Jordan and the Dead Sea.
But no movement of troops can be discerned from that distance,
unless by their multitude they color the slopes and the ravines.
II CHRONICLES 20:1-3 It came to pass . . . that the children of Moab, and the
children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against
Jehoshaphat to battle.
Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying There cometh a great
multitude against thee from beyond the sea, from Syria . . 1 And Jehoshaphat feared.
His prayer before the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem is
preserved in the Book of Chronicles. It begins with these words:
II CHRONICLES 20:6 . . . 0 Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven?
and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there
not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
Then he reminded the Lord that the land had been given to the
people of Israel forever:
II CHRONICLES 20:7 Art not thou our God who . . . gayest it to the seed of
Abraham thy friend for ever?
He expressed his belief that the Lord would not abandon the
place where a sanctuary was built to His name, and would come
with help.
II CHRONICLES 20:8-9 And they [thy people Israel] dwelt therein, and have built
thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,



If, when evil cometh upon us . . . and [we] Cry unto thee in our affliction, then
thou wilt hear and help.
Then Jehoshaphat explained the distress of his people.
II CHRONICLES 20:10-11 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and
mount Seir . . .
. . . come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
He concluded with an invocation declaring his and his people's
helplessness because of the great number of the invading hordes.
II CHRONICLES 20:12 . . . We have no might against this great company that
cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
The feelings of the king of Jerusalem at the sight of the immense
hordes converging on his kingdom are expressed both in his prayer
and in his letters. On earth his house was in vassalage to Egypt,
and the pharaoh was obliged to protect him.
The king of Jerusalem wrote to the pharaoh:
LETTER 288: Let the king care for his land. The land of the king will be lost. All of it
will be taken from me; there is hostility to me as far as the lands of Seeri and even to
Gintildrmil.2 There is peace to all the regents, but to me there is hostility.
The same region - Mount Seir ( Seeri) - is distinctly named in
both sources as the far land from which a part of the invaders
came.
The king expressed the belief that his lord would not abandon
the place on which he had set his name forever:
LETTER 287: Verily, the king has set his name upon the land of Urusalim for ever.
Therefore he cannot abandon the lands of Urusalim [Jerusalem].
At the same time he voiced his fear that if no help arrived the
invaders would cast them out of his lord's possession.
LETTER 287: If there are no archers [this year], then there will also remain to the king
no lands and no regents.
There exists a similarity between his appeal to his Lord in
heaven and to his lord on earth, but observing that help was not



arriving from the latter, he wrote impatient words he would not
have addressed to the first:
LETTER 288: Although a man sees the facts, yet the two eyes of the king, my lord, do
not see. . . . The Habiru are taking the cities of the king.
The king of Jerusalem, unlike other vassal kings, omits
expressions of respect for the gods of Egypt; he does not call the
pharaoh "my sun, my god," as all other vassal correspondents did;
in distinction to other writers of the letters, he does not mention his
God; he may be recognized as a servant of a Lord whose name he
would not profane in his letters to his pagan protector.
That the same type of appeal should issue from the mouth and
from the hand of the same human being is natural. In this case the
similarity casts light on the genuineness of this prayer in Chronicles;
it implies also the religious purity of the king-monotheist.
The letters contain details about this invasion and the threat to
Jerusalem. The shepherds of Moab and Seir took Rabbath of
Ammon in Tram-Jordan with the help of those chieftains who went
over to the invaders, and the population of Ammon joined the
nomads.
LETTER 289: After they have taken Rubuda, they seek now to take Urusalim.
Rubuda, written also Rubute,3 we recognized as "Rabbath of the
children of Ammon," a city still existing today. Separate bands
crossed the borders of the kingdom of Judah simultaneously at a
number of places. This is what is meant by the designation, "from
beyond the sea [the Dead Sea], from Syria."
That Syria offered a through way for them we learn from the
letters of the king of Sumur ( Samaria). A letter from Palestine
reports that the bands appeared even in the valley of Ajalon.4 This
explains the retreat of the population to the stronghold of
Jerusalem.
II CHRONICLES 20:4 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the
Lord: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.



And the king of Jerusalem wrote to the pharaoh:
LETTER 289: The whole land of the king has deserted.
An unexpected turn of events spared Jerusalem from
humiliation. The approach of the "multitude" of "the children of
Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir" toward Jerusalem was interrupted
by disagreement that flared up among the allies.
II CHRONICLES 20:23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made
an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
Something of these happenings is reflected in a letter of the king
of Sumur:
LETTER 76: Behold, he [Abdi-Ashirta] has now mustered all amelut gaz [bandits]
against Sigata and Ambi.
These cities were in the area of Ammon and Moab respectively.
Sigata appears to be Succoth on the river Jordan.
The king of Jerusalem pointed to the roving tribes penetrating
from the wastes of Trans-Jordan, and called them Habiru. Habiru
is derived from the Hebrew root haber, a member of a band, and
habiru means "bandits," and is used for "companions of thieves" in
Isaiah 1:23, "troops of robbers" in Hosea 6:9, and "companion of a
destroyer" in Proverbs 28:24.
This meaning of the word "Habiru" should have been suggested
by the fact that sa-gaz, which is translated "bandits," "cutthroats," is
interchanged with the term "Habiru."5 The various theories about
Habiru (Khabiru) of the el-Amarna letters - that it signifies "Ivri"
(Hebrew), or "apiru" (miners ), or "Afiru" (from the Babylonian
region of Afiru) - are thus found to be without foundation.
Habiru"is also written with an ideogram signifying 'cutthroats,' " C. J. Gadd, The Fall of
Nineveh (London, 1923).
1 Me'ever haiam me'aram gives no support to the King James version, from beyond the
sea on this side Syria."



2 In the translation of Knudtzon, and likewise in that of Mercer, the period is placed
differently: "There is hostility to me. As far as the lands of Seed and even to Gintilcirmil
there is peace to all regents, and to me there is hostility." Comparing this text with the
biblical text, we see that the new period precedes the words: "There is peace."

4 Letter 273.
The Revolt of the Sodomites
During the uneasy period through which Jerusalem passed, the
king of Judah apparently reached the conviction that a small and
ancient colony on the road from the Jordan to Jerusalem was
inclined to take the side of the enemies. Suwardata, the prince of
Kelti, changed his policy according to the way the wind blew. At
one time he wrote that he followed the king of Jerusalem against
the bandits (sa-gaz).1 At another time he opposed the king of
Jerusalem and complained that the king had taken Kelti. In his turn
he was accused by the king of Jerusalem of disloyalty to Egyptian
interests.
Kelti2 may be identified as Wadi Kelt on the way from Jerusalem
to Jericho.
A campaign of Jehoshaphat is briefly recorded in the First Book
of Kings:
I KINGS 22:46 And the remnants of the Sodomites, which remained in the days of
his father Ma, he took out of the land.
Wadi Kelt, where now a copious stream of water comes out of
the ground and flows toward the Dead Sea and a few anchorites
hide themselves among the rocks, was obviously the last abode of
the remnants of the valley which became a dead lake. They proved
to be disloyal at the time of the invasion of the desert tribes. The
king of Jerusalem wrote to them then, "Follow me," but they did
not. More details may be found in the letters of the king of
Jerusalem and Suwardata.



The name of this prince of the Sodomites may cause the
philologists to reflect on their racial origin.3
1 This letter of Suwardata confirms what has been established on the basis of other
considerations - that sa-gaz ("bandits," "pillagers") and FIabiru were the same, or if a
difference is to be drawn between these two denominations, the invaders themselves were
not different.
2 The usual identification is with Kila, about eight miles northwest of Hebron, "but in the
letter 289 it seems more closely associated with Bethshan and Shechem" (Mercer, Tell el
Amarna Tablets, p. 694).
3 After the death of Jehoshaphat "Libnah revolted" (II Chronicles 21:10) from under the
hand of his successor. It appears that the disturbing activities of a certain Labaia at the time
this king of Jerusalem was still alive were a preliminary phase of that revolt. It is supposed
that Labaia was not only the name of a chief but also of a group of the inhabitants (Weber
in Knudtzon, Die el-Amarna-Tafeln, p. 1558). Libnah, also called Labina (Josephus), was
situated between Makkedah and Lachish (Joshua 10:28f.). Labaia at one time approached
Malckedah (Letter 244) and another time attacked Gezer north of Lachish (Letter 254).
When Labaia sacked Gezer in the south he wrote to the pharaoh that this was "his only
crime" and that it was not true that he disobeyed the deputy or refused tribue.
The Second Siege of Samaria
The king of Damascus again laid siege to Samaria.
II KINGS 6:24 . . . King of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged
Samaria.
The king of Sumur ( Samaria) wrote:
LETTER 92: He [Abdi-Ashirta] has now come forth against me.
"Hostility against Sumur has become very great" is repeated in
many letters of the king of that city. In a number of letters he
complains of the distress of that city plagued by siege and famine.
This famine in the besieged city is described in the Book of Kings.
II KINGS 6:25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged
it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a
cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
The population of the city and its garrison fainted from hunger,
but the king of Samaria continued to defend the city and supervise



the bastions.
II KINGS 6:25 6:26 . . the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall . . .
This was a wall of a fortress. In one of the el-Amarna letters the
king wrote of the city:
LETTER 6:25 81: Formerly Suroura and its people were a fortress and garrison for
us.
When, during one of these inspections, the king learned that a
case of cannibalism had occurred in the city and that hunger had
overcome the mother instinct, he rent his clothes and the people
saw him in sackcloth (II Kings 6:29).
The king of Sumur (Samaria) dispatched the following message
to the pharaoh:
LETTER 74: May the Icing hear the words of his servant, and give life [provisions] to
his servant, that his servant may live. Then will I defend his faithful city. . . . Art thou
kindly disposed towards me? What shall I do in my solitude? Behold, thus I ask day
and night.
So wrote the king who, in hours of despair, put sackcloth on
himself.
His only hope lay in the quick arrival of help from without, but
time was passing and it seemed that no help would come to him.
LETTER 74: If there is not a man to deliver me out of the hand of the enemy [Abdi
Ashirta], and we - the regents - are put out of the lands, then all the lands will unite
with the amelut-gaz [pillagers] . . . And if the king should (then) march forth all lands
would be hostile to him, and what could he do for us then? Thus have they formed a
conspiracy with one another, and thus have I great fear that there is no man to rescue
me out of their hand.
Anxious to have help in time, he appealed to Aman-appa.1
Aman-appa was the dignitary to whom the king of Samaria (
Sumur ) wrote: "Thou knowest my attitude, whilst thou wast in
Sumura, that I was thy faithful servant." To this plenipotentiary and
ex-governor, Amon of Samaria (I Kings 22:26), the king put this
question:



LETTER 73: Why hast thou held back and not spoken to the king, thy lord, in order
that thou mayest march forth with the archers, and that thou mayest fall upon the land
of Amurri? If they perceive that the archers have gone forth, they will leave even their
cities and depart.
This quotation is of peculiar interest for comparison with the
story of the end of the second siege of Samaria, according to the
Book of Kings.
II KINGS 7:6-7 For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to
another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the
kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents,
and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled
for their life.
We know now that the fear of the Syrians at the walls of Samaria
was not groundless. The king of Israel really negotiated for the
departure of archers from Egypt. He knew in advance that merely
on hearing that "the archers have gone forth" the Syrians would
leave their tents and be put to flight.
The letters of el-Amarna and the Book of Kings present two
records which supplement each other.
The city was oppressed but not conquered. How this happened
is told in the Second Book of Kings, in Chapters 6-7. In accordance
with that record, we find this statement by the king of Sumur
Samaria) :
LETTER 106: They have been able to oppress it [Sumur] but they have not been able
to conquer it.
When gathering his host for the campaign that ended in flight,
the king of Damascus wrote to his warriors: "Assemble yourselves
in the house of Ninib."2 This might mean: "Make an alliance with
the king of Assyria."3 Behind the rebellion of the Moabite Mesha
was the intrigue of the king of Damascus, and he in his turn was
incited by the king of Assyria.



But when the king of Damascus fled from the walls of Samaria
and returned home from his unsuccessful campaign, he wrote to
the pharaoh:
LETTER 64: To the Icing, my lord, say. Thus saith Abdi-Ashtarti, the servant of the
king: At the feet of the king, my lord, I have fallen seven times . . . and seven times in
addition, upon breast as well as back. May the king, my lord, learn that enmity is
mighty against me. So may it seem good to the king, my lord, to send a powerful man
to protect me.
1 He wrote also to another dignitary in Egypt (Hata), explaining his plight and asking that
horses and infantry be sent (Letter 71).
2 Letter 74.
3 Beth-Ninib was a town in Palestine (Letter 290); Letter 74 may refer to this town.
However, see Weber, in Knudtzon, p. 1180.
Naaman Sar of Syria
The commander of the army of the king of Damascus bore the
name of Naaman. "Now Naaman, captain [sar] of the host of the
king of Syria [Aram], was a great man with his master, and
honourable, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto
Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour" (II Kings 5:1).
The fifth chapter of the Second Book of Kings narrates the story
of the healing of this captain by Elisha the prophet. It informs-us in
passing that the Syrians were prowling about in bands ( as often
mentioned in the el-Amarna letters) and carrying away captives out
of the land of Israel, and that among these captives was an Israelite
girl who became a handmaid in the household of the captain. The
members of the household advised him to try the treatment of the
prophet in Samaria. And the king of Syria said to Naaman: "Go to,
go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel."
When the king of Israel received the letter, he rent his clothes.
"Am I God," he asked, "that this man doth send unto me to recover
a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how
he seeketh a quarrel against me."



Elisha the seer intervened when he heard that the king had rent
his clothes. The story of how Elisha healed Naaman the captain is
well known.1
In the quoted portion of the story, two facts are somewhat
strange. First, inasmuch as Ben-Hadad himself was at the head of
the thirty-two captains of his army,2 why, in this story of the
wondrous healing, is the deliverance of Syria credited to a captain
Naaman? Second, the king of Israel was a lifelong rival of the king
of Damascus. Why, then, did this request to cure a sick captain
inspire in the king of Israel such dread that he rent his clothes?
For an explanation of the real role of this captain Naaman we
shall look to the contemporaneous letters. A man by whom Syria
received deliverance must be identifiable in the letters. We
recognize him in the person of Ianhama, called also Iaanhamu.
Ianhama, the pharaoh's deputy in Syria, was sent to the king of
Damascus with prerogatives similar to those which Aman-appa had
when he was with the king of Samaria. Naaman's title in the
Scriptures - sar - is also used in the letters. He was a plenipotentiary
of the king of Egypt, in charge of the army and walled cities in
Amuru. land (Syria), later also the overseer of stores of grain. He
had great influence in all matters of Syrian administration. Judged
by his name, he was of Syrian origin, as were some other
dignitaries at the court of Thebes.3 Ianhama is a Semitic name.
"Ianhama was a powerful Egyptian agent in Syria, where he was
respected as a good and wise man, and where he proved himself
to be the most faithful of the pharaoh's servants."4
The servant of Elisha said: "Behold, my master hath spared
Naaman this Syrian [Arami], in not receiving at his hand that
which he brought." When healed, Naaman asked Elisha to give
him two mules' burden of earth, "for thy servant will henceforth
offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto
the Lord. In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my
master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he
leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: . .



. the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing." Here the god Rimmon
was probably the god Ra-Amon, the chief god of the Egyptians.
Ianhama's master was Amenhotep, and later Akhnaton. Ianhama,
as may be seen from the context of the letters, protected the king of
Damascus and helped him in his rise to power. At various times he
is reported to have been in Syria and in Egypt, favoring a policy of
balanced relations in Syria in view of the necessity to secure the
position of Damascus in the Syrian bloc against the "king of Hatti."
Accordingly it is said in the Second Book of Kings that through
Naaman, "a great man with his master, and honourable . . . the
Lord had given deliverance unto Syria."
In the early letters of the king of Sumur (Samaria) his fear of the
mighty deputy of the pharaoh is plainly expressed. In one letter he
wrote to the pharaoh: "Thou must rescue me out of the hand of
Iaanhnniu."5 He asked the pharaoh to inform his deputy that he,
Ianhama, would be responsible if anything should happen to the
person of the king of Samaria. "Say to Ianhama: 'Rib-Addi is even
in thy hands, and all that will be done to him rests upon thee.'"6
Later on, when Aman-appa left Samaria and died in Egypt,7 the
king of Samaria wrote to the pharaoh asking him to appoint
Ianhama governor in Samaria. He asked the pharaoh: "May it
seem right to my lord to send Ianhama as his deputy. I hear from
the mouth of the people that he is a wise man and all people love
him."8 We recall the scriptural words about Naaman, that he was
an "honourable" man.
What happened that the king of Samaria, who once feared
Ianhama and asked to be rescued from his hand, should now
himself recommend that very man for the governorship of
Samaria? In another letter he again asks the pharaoh to send
Ianhama and in the next one he praises him in these words: "There
is no servant like Ianhama, a faithful servant to the king."9
Ianhama wrote from Egypt to the king of Samaria: "Go and
occupy Sumur until I come . . . enter, fear not,"10 and the king of
Sumur (Samaria) wrote him, in the hope that the pharaoh would



appoint Ianhama: "Hasten very quickly thy arrival," and explained
that because of the hostility of the people of Ambi he was unable to
enter Samaria.
The letters do not show why the fear of the king of Samaria
changed into confidence with respect to the Syrian deputy. The
Scriptures provide the explanation in the story of the healing of
Naaman by the prophet of Samaria. Naaman was very grateful to
the prophet, and also to the king of Samaria, to whom he came
with a letter from the king of Damascus. "Behold, now I know that
there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel" (II Kings 5:15). Elisha
even declared that he would heal Naaman in order to help the king
of Israel politically.
So he became a friend. When the king of Damascus was killed,
as will be narrated on a subsequent page, Ianhama (Naaman) was
apparently in Egypt. He did not support the next Syrian king; he
corresponded with the king of Samaria and favored him.
Certain other features of the role and character of Ianhama,
reflected in the letters, are shown also in the Scriptures. He was a
generous man. This appears in the story of the healing: he gave to
the servant of the prophet two talents of silver and two changes of
garments, more than the servant had asked for, when the prophet
refused to take ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and
ten changes of raiment.
It is of interest to find that, according to the letters, Ianhama was
in charge of the pharaoh's treasury in Syria, being over "money
and clothing."11
Paying with a combination of money and clothing is a true
custom of that time. In one letter the king of Sumur wrote that he
paid "thirteen silvers and one pair of garments" for someone to go
on an errand.12
According to the Scriptures, the Syrian governor had in his
house an Israelite girl, a captive carried off by a Syrian band, who
waited on his wife.13 In an early letter of the king of Sumur



(Samaria) to the pharaoh there is a complaint that two people from
his domain are detained in the private home of Ianhama."
The el-Amarna letters also speak of him as the generous patron
of a Palestinian youth, who was educated in Egypt at his
expense.15
The man "by whom the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria"
and who was feared by the king of Samaria was Ianhama.16 How
this captain changed his attitude and became a supporter of the
king of Samaria is recorded in the letters and is explained by the
Scriptures.
1 He ordered seven baths in the Jordan. The Jordan is rich in sulfur, potassium, and
magnesium, which enter the river from the springs at the Sea of Galilee and form the
deposits of the Dead Sea, where the water evaporates and the salts remain.
2 Or "thirty and two kings that helped him" (I Kings 20:16 ).
3 As, for example, Dudu, referred to later in this chapter.

The Letters of the "Great Woman of Shunem"



Informative letters were sent to the pharaoh by a woman
correspondent called Baalat-Nese. Two of them are preserved.
Who might this female person be who was at that time in Palestine
and of high enough rank to write to the sovereign in Egypt? She is
the only lady correspondent from Palestine in the el-Amarna
collection.
In her first letter1 she informed the pharaoh that the pillagers (sa
gaz people) had sent bands to Ajaluna ( Ajalon). She wrote about
"two sons of Milkili" in connection with a raid that apparently
threatened her native town. The menace was not averted because
she wrote again:
LETTER 274: Thus said Baalat-Nese, thy handmaid, the dust of thy feet. . . . Let the
king, my lord, deliver his land out of the hands of the amelut sa-gaz-Mesh [people of
the bandit Mesh], that it may not be destroyed. . . .
And she advised the pharaoh that the invaders were coming
nearer and that another town had fallen: "Verily, this is for the
information of the king, my lord."
In Letter 250 from the hand of another correspondent we read
that Milkili "took stand against Shunama and Burkuna." If we put
this statement together with the fact that the lady correspondent
complained to the pharaoh of the bands of Milkili that threatened
her domicile, it becomes quite apparent that her home was either
at Shunama or Burkuna.
If this very simple deduction is not fallacious, then not only
would the lady of Shunama or Burkuna be one of the el-Amarna
correspondents, but she would also have a page in the Old
Testament. And in fact she has. It begins with the verse:
II KINGS 4:8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great
woman.
Shunem is doubtless Shunama. To suppose that there was
another "great woman" at the same time in the same town or in the
neighboring town of Burkuna would be a forced conjecture.



The name of the "great woman," Baalat-Nese, might be under
stood as "a woman to whom occurred a wonder" ( Baal at-Nese ).2
The story of Elisha breathing life into the son of the lady of
Shuncm would have been a matter of talk in the palaces of that
time; it was the subject of the royal audience granted by the king of
Israel to the servant of Elisha (II Kings 8:4). The woman could also
have been known in the palace of Egypt as "a woman to whom
was a wonder." Her high position was enhanced by the wide
circulation of the story about the revival of her child.
The very existence of a "great lady" by the name of Baalat-Nese
in the city or district of Shunem ( Shunama) at the time of a famine
and of the revolt of Mesh (Mesha ) seems to throw a sidelight on
the coming and going of a healer and holy man venerated in folk
traditions, Elisha.
1 Letter 273.
2 This translation should be substituted for "Mistress of Lions" (see Mercer, Tell el-Amarna
Tablets, note to Letter 273); the ideogram for "lion" is nefe, but this ideogram could have
been used to represent the phonetically similar word in Hebrew which means "sign" or
"miracle."
The King of Damascus Conspires against the Life of the King
of Samaria
Famine, lack of a consistent policy in dealing with the Syrian
vassals, and frequent and prolonged absences of the Egyptian
governors contributed to the reduction of the area to a state of
anarchy. The king of Sumur (Samaria) warned the pharaoh:
LETTER 75: Aduna king of Irqata, mercenaries have killed [him] and there is no one
who has said anything to Abdi-Ashirta, although thou didst know it. . . . The people of
Ammi have killed its lord. So I am afraid.
He was afraid, and not without reason, for he himself was
chosen to be a victim and to be killed from ambush.
II KINGS 6:8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his
servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.



10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor
twice.
The corresponding passage in the el-Amarna tablets is found in
the letters of the king of Sumur to the pharaoh and also to his
former governor, Aman-appa:
LETTER 81: A stranger stood with drawn dagger against me; but I killed him. . . .
Abdi-Ashirta, at his command was committed this deed against me. Behold, thus I
remain shut up in the midst of my city. I cannot go out of the gate. . . . I have been
wounded nine times, and so I have feared for my life.
The letters describe the terror which the king of Damascus
inspired in the king of Samaria (Sumur), then at his residence in
Jezreel (Gubla), by setting an ambush at the places where the
hunted rival was supposed to pass. The king of Sumur wrote:
LETTER 88: He [Abdi-Ashirta, king of Damascus] slinks around about every gate of
Gubla. . . . We cannot go out of the gates.
Josephus Flavius, who related the story following the Scriptures,
wrote of "secret attempts on the life of the Israelite king"1 : "There
were some Syrians lying in wait to kill him"2 and the king did not
dare to go out of the city; but "Adados [Ben-Hadad] was
unsuccessful in his plot" and "decided to fight openly."
The grove of Jezebel (Gubla) provided the bands of the king of
Damascus with hiding places. The grove is mentioned in the
Scriptures: "And Ahab made a grove" (I Kings 16:33). The garden
of herbs in the vineyard of Naboth was part of the grove. Probably
because of the scarcity of water during a number of years, the
grove had withered. The king decided to cut it down for reasons of
safety, being afraid for his life. He wrote to the pharaoh:
LETTER 91: He [Abdi-Ashirta] sought to take Gubla, and I myself have felled my
groves.
It may be that we have here an explanation of why the vineyard
of Naboth, planted by Ahab and Jezebel to serve as a garden, is



called only "the field" in the fatal epilogue to the drama of Naboth
(II Kings 9:37).

The King of Damascus Is Killed While Lying Ill
After years of sieges and battles the day came when the adversary
of the Icing of Samaria was afflicted with a grave disease.
II KINGS 8:7-9 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria was
sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
And the king said unto Hazael . . . go . . . enquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall
I recover of this disease?
So Hazael went to meet him . . . and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben
Hadad king of Syria bath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
The question of whether the king of Damascus would recover
from his sickness or die is repeated in the letter of the king of
Sumur ( Samaria) to "a chief" in Egypt:
LETTER 95: Abdi-Ashirta is very sick, who knows but that he will die?
He died on his sickbed, but not from his disease; he was killed.'
A man in Gubla reported to the pharaoh:
LETTER 101: They have indeed killed Abdi-Ashirta, whom the king [pharaoh] had
placed over them.
A more detailed record is preserved in the Hebrew sources,
where Hazael is named as the assassin.
II KINGS 8:15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and
dipped it in water and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his
stead.
Both records agree that Ben-Hadad (Abdi-Ashirta) was gravely
ill, but he did not die from his disease; he met a violent death.
The el-Amarna letters provide us with additional information.
Hazael (Aziru, Azaru) was a son of Ben-Hadad: "Aziru, a son of



Abdi-Ashirta, is with his brothers in Dumasqa."2
This information is not entirely new. Nicholas of Damascus, an
author of the first century B.C., wrote: "After the death of Adad
(Hadad), his descendants reigned for ten generations, each of
whom inherited from his father the name and the crown."3 It was
suggested that Nicholas of Damascus had been mistaken.4 Now we
have authentic documents proving that he was correct in declaring
Hazael to be a son of Ben-Hadad. It is told in the Scriptures that
Hazael "returned to his lord" in Damascus after greeting Elisha.
Calling his father, the king, "lord" is entirely in keeping with the
customs and the language.5
Hazael was not the lawful heir to the throne. Like Ahab, who
had one queen but many wives and seventy sons by them in
Samaria, Ben-Hadad probably had many sons. From an inscription
of Shalmaneser it may be inferred that Hazael was born of a
concubine: "Hazael, son of nobody, seized the throne."6 In the el
Amarna letters he is persistently called slave.
But if Menander's story about Abd' Astartus, grandson of Hiram,
is the story of Abdi-Ashirta, also called Abdu-Astarti,7 the scriptural
Ben-Hadad, then the king of Damascus was killed by the sons of
his nurse. Sons of the royal nurse were held in honor, and
occasionally could even lay claim to the throne.8
Aziru, also called Azaru9 (Hazael or Azaelos of Josephus), was
anxious to secure the consent of the pharaoh to his seizure of the
throne of the murdered Abdi-Ashirta (Ben-Hadad). The
assassination had not been accomplished in public, so Hazael
could try to exculpate himself, pleading that he was wrongly
accused of the crime. He wrote: "I have not sinned. Not the least
have I done against the king, my lord. The king, my lord, knows
the people who have committed crime."10
These words imply that the accusation had reached the Egyptian
capital.

Hazael, "the Dog," Burns the Strongholds of Israel
The reign of Hazael (Azaru, Aziru) proved to be even more
disastrous for the realm of Israel than the reign of the slain king of
Damascus. The famine still plagued the people of Samaria in the
days of King Hazael as in the days of his father. Samaria was in a
state of almost constant siege and changed hands over a period of
more than five years.1 The king of Sumur (Samaria) wrote:
LETTER 125: Aziru has again oppressed me. . . . My cities belong to Aziru, and he
seeks after me. . . . What are the dogs, the sons of Abdi-Ashirta, that they act
according to their heart's wish, and cause the cities of the king to go up in smoke?
This is almost exactly what Elisha said when, before the gates of
Damascus, he announced to Hazael that he would be king over
Syria:



II KINGS 8:11-13 . . . and the man of God wept.
And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? and he answered, Because I know the
evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire .
..
And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?
His expression, "is thy servant a dog . . . ?" which accidentally
escaped oblivion, was a typical figure of speech at the time of the
el-Amarna letters. Many chieftains and governors concluded their
letters with this sentence: "Is thy servant a dog that he shall not
hear the words of the king, the lord?"
(Samaria) and other dispatchers of messages also use the word
In referring to Aziru (Hazael), in many a letter the king of
Sumur"dog." Sometimes the name of Aziru is not mentioned at all,
only the word "dog." For example, in Letter 108 it is written,
"because of the dog," and the pharaoh knew who was meant.
Another figure of speech out of the mouth of Hazael in the
Scriptures is repeated in his letters. When Hazael went to meet the
prophet Elisha he said:
II KINGS 8:9 Thy son Ben-Hadad king of Syria bath sent me to thee.
In his letters to Dudu in Egypt Aziru wrote:
LETTER 158: To Dudu, my lord, my father. Thus saith Aziri, thy son, thy servant.
He employed the expressions, "thy son," "thy servant," in letters
and in conversation to show respect. In the only dialogue
preserved in the Scriptures in which Hazael participates, there are
three turns of speech that also appear in his letters. The context of
the dialogue - the question of whether the king of Damascus would
survive, and the statement that he, Hazael, the new king, would
cause the cities (of Israel) to go up in smoke - is also preserved in
the el-Amarna letters. It is therefore a precious example of the
authenticity of the scriptural orations and dialogues.
At this point it is appropriate to quote one of the letters of Aziru
(Hazael) to this mighty man in Egypt who is called Dudu. It will
give us an idea of who was the secret force in the colonial office of



Egypt which supported Abdi-Ashirta and his son in their
adventurous campaigns in Syria and Palestine.
LETTER 158: To Dudu, my lord, my father, Thus saitb. Aziri, thy son, thy servant: At
the feet of my father I will fall down. May my father be well. . . Behold, thou are
there, my father, and whatever is the wish of Dudu, my father, write, and I will indeed
perform it. Behold, thou art my father and my lord, and I am thy son. The lands of
Amurri are thy lands, and my house is thy house, and all thy wish write. And, behold, I
will perform thy wish. And, behold, thou sittest before the king, my lord, - enemies
have spoken words of slander to my father before the king, my lord. But do thou not
admit them. And behold, mayest thou sit before the king, my lord, when I arise and
words of slander against me not admit. . . . But if the king, my lord, does not love me
but hates me, what shall I then say?
Who knows whether all the letters of the king of Sumur (
Samaria) reached the eyes of Akhnaton? The king of Samaria
complained that many of his messages went unanswered and did
not receive due attention.
This Dudu, whose splendid sepulcher is preserved among the
tombs of the courtiers of Akhnaton in Akhet-Aton ( Tell el-Amarna),
is thought to have been of Semitic origin. His reward at the hand of
the pharaoh was celebrated by some Asiatics, as the murals in the
tomb witness.2 These Asiatics were Syrians. The name Dudu is a
Semitic name of the Kings period in Palestine. It appears in the
Scriptures as Dodo (II Samuel 23:9, 24).
It is conceivable that this Dudu was a descendant of Hadad the
Edomite, who was an adversary of Solomon and who married into
the royal house of Egypt (I Kings 11:19).
Dudu, the chamberlain and the "chief mouthpiece of all the
foreign lands," as he described himself in an inscription in his
sepulchral hall, made matters easier for Aziru (Hazael), and some
of the tablets of the king of Sumur (Samaria) waited twenty-seven
centuries before receiving attention. Their author, desperate at the
thought that his messages might not have been reported to the
pharaoh, and fearing that he was carrying on a soliloquy, closed a
letter with a bitter plea:
LETTER 122: I in my solitude protect my right. . . . What should I do? Hear! I beg:
refuse not. There are people in the presence of the king, or there are not? Hear me!



Behold, so have I written to the palace; but thou bast not hearkened.
The words of Elisha announcing to Hazael his accession to the
throne and his wars against Israel were fulfilled. Hazael (Aziru)
oppressed Israel even more than did Ben-Hadad (Abdi-Ashirta). A
tablet was sent to Pharaoh from Gubla (Jezreel):
LETTER 127: When, formerly, Abdi-Ashratu [Abdi-Ashirta] marched up against me, I
was mighty; but, behold, now my people are crushed.
In a series of raids Hazael depopulated the land.
LETTER 109: But, verily, the sons of Abdi-Ashirta, the slave, the dog, have taken the
cities of the king and the cities of his regents, according to their pleasure. . . . Under
such circumstances my heart burned. . . . And they strive for crime, outrage . . .
The outrages of Hazael are described in the Scriptures: not only
did he kill the men, but he crushed their children and ripped open
their women with child (II Kings 8:12).
Another tablet was sent to the pharaoh from Gubla:
LETTER 124: Aziru has taken all my cities, Gubla in her solitude is left to me. . . .
Behold, soldiers have gone up against Gubla . And if he takes it, where shall I stand?
This oppression by Aziru. (Hazael) lasted many years; the last
letters of el-Amarna still tell of it; it endured as long as he lived and
reigned.
A parallel account is in the following passage of the Scriptures:
II KINGS 10:32 In those days the Lord began to cut Israel shoat: and Hazael smote
them in all the coasts of Israel.

The Last Letters of Ahab
"The people of Gubla and my house and my wife said to me:
`Attach yourself to the son of Abdi-Ashirta and let us make peace



between us.' But I refused."1
So wrote the king "whom Jezebel his wife stirred up" (I Kings
21:25). The protests of the population he met with reprisals. "And
they said: 'How long wilt thou kill us? Where wilt thou get people to
live in the city?" he himself reported. "When I was discouraged I
wrenched from my heart a decision,"2 and he went to Beirut to
make friends with the king of that city and prepare a refuge in case
Aziru (Hazael ) drove him out of his city. The king of Samaria was
a son-in-law of the king of Sidon (I Kings 16:31), and the king of
Beirut was probably a relative of this family. When he departed his
city closed its gates behind him. From his refuge he complained to
the pharaoh. He reported that he had massacred his opponents,
which was not the first time he had done so: one such instance is
also recorded in the Scriptures in the story of the condemning to
death of all the members of the opposing party of Yahwists (I Kings
18:3ff.). He feared an insurrection of his people, and this he had
already expressed repeatedly in his early and later letters: "I am
afraid that the peasants will slay me," "I fear my peasants," "my
peasants will rebel.."3
He wrote as though he feared the curse of Elijah pronounced in
the field of Naboth: "In the place where dogs licked the blood of
Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine."
LETTER 138: And behold, the people of Gubla have now written to me: . . . Behold
their hostile words: "Give it his flowing blood."
This detail of his refuge in Beirut and later in Sidon,4 apparently
in the house of Jezebel's relatives for more than one year, is not
recorded in the Scriptures, but it was this absence that gave rise to
the rumors that he was dead. "They said: `Our lord is indeed
dead?' " They had said: `Rib-Addi is dead, and we are out of his
power.5 s This episode and the belief that the king had died may
have contributed to the confusion of a later chronicler, and may
have been one reason for the many chronological and dynastic
contradictions between the different versions of the Scriptures.



Here the letters of Rib-Addi, the scriptural Ahab, cease. He, "an
old man," asked, with very little hope of gaining the attention of the
Egyptian suzerain, whether the pharaoh would assign "Buruzilim"
to him as a residence.6 Did he mean Jerusalem, and did his scribe
merely show his ignorance, as in many other letters of the el
Amarna collection where the names of cities and persons are
spelled arbitrarily? Or is it that the Hebrew preposition "in" (b' in
Hebrew) remained attached to the name of the city written in
cuneiform?
Jehoshaphat had died only shortly before. Apparently the
pharaoh gave the kingdom of Israel to Jehoram, son of
Jehoshaphat and son-in-law of Ahab; it seems that Jehoram took it
upon himself to restore order in the northern kingdom, leaving his
young son Ahaziah in Jerusalem."7
The last letter of Rib-Addi ends with the admonition: "When I
die, my sons, the servants of the king, will still live, and they will
write to the king: '0 bring us back into our city."
The feared revolt was led by the long-suppressed Yahwist party.
The conspiracy in the army, which opposed Hazael, broke out, and
the revolt struck Jezreel. Jehu drove furiously to Jezreel and killed
Jehoram, previously wounded in a battle with the Syrians, and
Ahaziah, who had come from Jerusalem to visit him. Jezebel was
thrown out of the window, and Jehu's horses trod upon her, and
her flesh was torn by dogs in the field of Naboth, leaving for burial
only the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
The seventy sons of Ahab who dwelt in Samaria were also put to
death, and their heads were carried in baskets to Jezreel (II Kings
10:7).
The prince of Beirut informed the pharaoh that the children of
the king of Gubla and Sumur (Letter 142) were given by his
brother into the hands of offenders. From the Scriptures we know
that Jehu killed the kin of Ahab in Samaria and Jezreel. "So Jehu
slew all the remainder of the house of Ahab in Jezreel" (II Kings
10:11).



The sixty-five letters of Rib-Addi, king of Sumur and Gubla
(Samaria and Jezebel-Jezreel), written to the pharaoh Amenhotep ,
the pharaoh Akhnaton, and the governor Aman-appa, disclose the
human nature of their author; he was a man with a heavy heart,
sad and worried. There is not one cheerful line in his letters. It is
true that the events of his time in his land justified this state of
mind. No one else among all the correspondents of the el-Amarna
period wrote such distressed letters. "What shall I do in roy
solitude? Behold, this I ask day and night.' He impressed his
people, too, by his melancholy.
"And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased. . . . And
he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and
would eat no bread" - so when Naboth refused him the vineyard (I
Kings 21:4). "He rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh,
and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly" - so when Elijah
cursed him and Jezebel for what had been done to Naboth, who
was sentenced to death by stoning on the testimony of false
witnesses (I Kings 21:27). "And the king of Israel went to his house
heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria" - so when he heard
that he had failed by letting Ben-Hadad go away with a covenant (I
Kings 20:43).
The Scriptures condemned this idolator who was possessed by
religious zeal: "And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the
Lord above all that were before him" (I Kings 16:30).
The rabbinical tradition condemned Ahab for his idolatry and
the persecution of the prophets of Yahweh, but could not close its
eyes to his patriotism and the deep emotions of his perturbed soul.
"In the heavenly court of justice, at Ahab's trial, the accusing
witnesses and his defenders exactly balanced each other in number
and statements, until the spirit of Naboth appeared and turned the
scale against Ahab."8
A minute study of this period might create the false impression
that Ben-Hadad and Hazael were the principal adversaries in the
long Jewish history, and not just two villains who might be found



in. any generation. However, they became the national heroes of
the Syrian history. It is a fact that in Syria, in the time of Josephus
Flavius, nine hundred years after the time I describe, these two
kings were honored as great builders and great conquerors and
great characters, and the people of Damascus cherished the
memory of these national heroes and saints. Josephus, after
describing the act of murder, wrote: "Adados and Azaelos who
ruled after him are to this day honored as gods because of their
benefactions and the building of temples with which they adorned
the city of Damascus. And they [the Syrians and the people of
Damascus] have processions every day in honour of these kings
and glory in their antiquity. . . ."9 The Arabs of Damascus feasted in
memory of Ben Hadad and his murderous son. Their rival, Ahab,
went down in the memory of his people as a great sinner in Israel.
The attention given to the historical events and even to some
minor happenings of the period with which this chapter deals is
due mainly to the fact that the priceless el-Amarna letters were
written at that time, and they provide rich material for parallels.
From the standpoint of the biblical narrative, the importance lent to
the period is enhanced, for the letters deal with the mist-shrouded
time of Elijah and Elisha, the seers.

Chapter VIII
THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS
(CONCLUDED)
Iarimuta
ON READING the letters of the king of Sumur (Samaria), we are
impressed by the frequent mention of a place called Iarimuta, also
Rimuta,1 and by the role it played in the aspirations of the king.
This place is referred to only in his letters, eighteen times in thirteen
letters. From there his people obtained grain in the years of the
famine in return for heavy payments, trading of household
implements, and even giving children into slavery. In previous
times grain from Iarimuta had belonged by right to Sumur
(Samaria). The king wrote to the pharaoh asking his command:
"May it seem good to the king, my lord, that grain be given,
produce of the land Iarimuta ."2 In like manner he wrote to the
governor Aman-appa: "Say to thy lord that there should be given
to his servant the produce of the land of Iarimuta, as was formerly
given to Sumura."3
The king of Sumur ( Samaria) had a claim on this place, and he
submitted the claim to three Egyptian deputies, two of them being
Aman-appa and Ianhama, "and they have recognized my right."
The dispute was with the king of Damascus over Iarimuta.
LETTER 105: Because of that which belongs to me . . . he has become hostile to me.
. . . He oppressed - and he has taken - he has become hostile to me on account of - to
take grain for nourishment from Iarimuta that I die not.
For a time Iarimuta was held by the king of Sumur and Gubla,
and his army was stationed there, because he wrote to the



pharaoh: "Say to Ianhama that (he) take money and clothing for
the people of Gubla in Iarimuta."
The conflict over Iarimuta outlived Abdi-Ashirta (Ben-Hadad)
and was still acute in the days of Aziru (Hazael).
The king of Sumur ( Samaria) required of the pharaoh military
assistance to compel the local chief, who had aligned himself with
the Icing of Damascus, to give provisions to the peasants and
soldiers.
LETTER 114: Formerly, my peasants have provided provisions from the land of
Iarimuta. But, behold, Iapa-Addi did not permit them to go for provisions for the
garrison. So, then, let the king send thy archers. . . . Care for me. Who would be a
friend if I should die? Is not Iapa-Addi with Aziru?
During his entire reign he insisted that Iarimuta's grain, as in
former times, must belong to him and his people.
LETTER 125: Formerly, a royal garrison was with me, and the king gave grain from
Iarimuta for their provisions. But, behold, now Aziru has again oppressed me.
There have been various conjectures about this place: that it was
in Goshen in Egypt,4 this according with the theory that Ianhama
was the scriptural Joseph; that Iarimuta was the ancient name for
Philistia and Sharon;5 that it was in the plain of Antioch.6
"Iarimuta's location is uncertain."7
If this place interested the king of Sumur (Samaria) so much that
he involved himself in a prolonged conflict over it, claiming its
produce, we may expect that the Scriptures will give the answer to
the question: What place was it?
II KINGS 22:3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants: Know ye that Ramoth in
Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
Ramoth in Gilead played a most important role in the wars of
the king of Israel. He conferred with his prophets: "Shall we go
against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?" His
governor, Amon, supported him in this undertaking (I Kings
22:26). Jehoshaphat accompanied him to battle in Ramoth, as



already narrated; there, according to one version, Ahab was killed,
according to another he was only wounded.
At a later date the king of Israel "had kept Ramoth-Gilead, he
and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria" (II Kings 9:14);8 on
this front Jehu was anointed by the messenger of Elisha (II Kings
9:4).
Josephus Flavius gave the name of the place for which Ahab
battled with the Syrians as Aramatha in Galadene.9
Ramoth of the Bible and Aramatha of Josephus is Iarimuta or
Rimuta of the el-Amarna letters.
The battles and wars waged for this place in the years when
Samaria suffered from famine are well explained by the letters: the
high land of Gilead was the breadbasket of the entire region, and
famine had not touched it.
Ramoth in Gilead is prominently mentioned in the Scriptures
during the time of Ahab-Jehoram and Jehoshaphat, and only
during this time.10

Samaria (Sumur) under the Oligarchs
During the period of the el-Amarna letters Sumur (Samaria ),
though the center of Egyptian administration, was almost
constantly beleaguered by the kings of Damascus. The two sieges
of Samaria, acid its liberation from the first by "the young men of
the governors of the provinces" and from a long second siege as
the result of a. rumor of the arrival of an Egyptian army, with the
parallels from the Scriptures and the el-Amarna letters, have been
recorded in earlier pages.
Besides the king and the governor, the elders also exercised
authority in the city. To their decision the king submitted the fate of
the city when he received the ultimatum of the king of Damascus
during the first siege (I Kings 20:7).
For the larger part of the period of the el-Amarna letters the king
of Sumur lived in his second residence, and from there wrote most
of his letters pleading for aid for his capital. At the beginning of that
period the governor Aman-appa (the biblical governor Amon)
relinquished his permanent post in Sumur, and for the greater part
of the time was in Egypt. Ianhama's seat was in Damascus.
Because of the anarchical conditions that prevailed as a result of
the many vicissitudes and frequent sieges, the elders of Sumur
became more influential, and for some time were the only authority
in the city. Aziru (Hazael), when his attempt to enter Sumur failed,
wrote in a letter:
LETTER 157: But the chief men of Sumur have not admitted me.
To these chief men or "rulers and elders" of Samaria Jehu wrote,
challenging them to choose one of the sons of Ahab to be king or
yield. to him (II Kings 10).
This time the oligarchs became frightened and admitted Jehu
into the city.
The "King's City," Sumur



The city of Samaria was a "king's city," a residence bunt as the
center of Egyptian administration of the Asiatic provinces. Pharaoh
used to send silver to Samaria in the days of Omri, who built it.
LETTER 126: Formerly, however, there was sent to ray father from the great palace
silver. . . .
Egypt received meager, if any, tribute in return. The pharaoh
also provided Samaria with chariots.
In the city was a palace, and the "king's house" of Sumur is often
mentioned in the el-Amarna letters; nominally it was the residence
of the pharaoh, but actually it was the residence of his regent - the
vassal king - and probably also of the Egyptian deputy attached to
the vassal. The "king's house" is referred to also in the stele of
Mesha, who repaired it. The palace built by Ahab in Samaria is
mentioned in the Scriptures; it was overlaid with ivory. The words
of Mesha, "I have cut its cuttings," might refer to the ivory carvings
on the palace. The ivory of the Samarian palace of Omri and Ahab
was found in abundance during the excavations.1 More will be said
about it in a later section of this chapter.
The city of Samaria was surrounded by a wall. This wall is
mentioned both in the Scriptures and in the letters of el-Amarna. It
is also referred to in the Mesha stele.
The place before the gate was the scene of the two-king
conference with the prophets; the thrones were placed "at the
entering in of the gate of Samaria" (II Chronicles 18:9). The gate
was also the station of the officer appointed "to have the charge of
the gate" (II Kings 7:17). He had to collect silver in payment for the
barley and flour abandoned by the Syrians who had fled from
beneath the walls of Samaria. The officer was trodden to death.
The custom of taking money at the gate is also mentioned in a
letter by the king of Sumur: "All my gates have taken copper."2 The
gate of Samaria, which was an important place - a kind of forum
for the people - is referred to in the Mesha inscription, as well as in
the Scriptures and the el-Amarna letters.



In the city was a mound or acropolis called Ophel. It is
mentioned in the Scriptures (II Kings 5:24) and in the stele of
Mesha.
The excavations at Samaria disclosed two portions of the ancient
wall, the place of the gate (the city wall had only one gate), and
buildings of a palatial type .3
Since Mesh (Mesha) occupied Samaria in partnership with the
king of Damascus, in his stele he ascribed the building activity in
the city to himself, the work being done by the Israelite captives.
The king of Damascus wrote similarly to a dignitary in Egypt,
after all the devastation that the city had suffered in wars and
sieges: "I built Sumur . . "4 meaning that he, with the work of the
Israelite captives, repaired the walls of the palace and of other
buildings. This privilege to build in Samaria was highly esteemed,
and is mentioned in the treaty between Ben-Hadad and Ahab.
After the defeat of the Syrians at Aphek, Ben-Hadad told the king
of Samaria:
II KINGS 20:34 Thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in
Samaria.
When, for a time, the city fell into his hands, he resumed
together with the rebel Mesh (King Mesha ) - the building activity
there.
The next king of Damascus, Aziru, the scriptural Hazael, during
the time he held Sumur ( Samaria), promised: "I will build it up
Sumer now. . . . My lord, I will now build Sumur in haste,"5 and
again, "I have not built Sumur. But in one year I will build Zumur
[Sumur]. . . ."6

Shalmaneser III Expels King Nikmed
According to the reconstruction of history presented here, the el
Amarna letters were written, not at the beginning of the fourteenth
century, but during the three decades - 870 to - 840. In about the
year - 858, Shalmaneser became king of Assyria. Later he became
Icing of Babylonia, too, and made offerings in Babylon, Borsippa,
and Kutha.1 He undertook a number of devastating raids on the
Phoenician shore and on northern Syria. Placing the el-Amarna
letters in the time of Jehoshaphat, king of Jerusalem, and Ahab,
king of Samaria, and Shalmaneser, their contemporary, challenges
me to demonstrate agreement not only between the letters and the
Books of Kings and Chronicles, but also between the letters and the
Assyrian inscriptions. In his annals Shalmaneser gave an account of
his wars, the larger part of which were carried on in Syria.
In a letter written by Abimilki, king of Tyre, and found in Tell el
Amarna, it is reported: "And fire has consumed Ugarit, the city of
the king; half of it is consumed, and its other half is not; and the
people of the army of Hatti are not there [any more]." In the
section "End of Ugarit," in Chapter V, we asked, Who was the
invader? We quoted also a proclamation found in Ras Shamra
Ugarit in which the invading king decreed that "the Jaman
[Ionians], the people of Didyme, the Khar [Carians], the Cypriotes,
all foreigners, together with the king Nikmed," should be expelled
from Ugarit. The opening portion of the proclamation, which might
have revealed the name of the king who expelled Nikmed, is
missing. Some intimation has been found that Nikmed was
expelled by the Babylonians,2 who are called here Hatti. This
suggestion is not far from the truth, since Babylon was
incorporated by Shalmaneser into his empire.
We are curious to know whether Shalmaneser left any written
record of his conquest of Ugarit. And in fact we find the following



entry twice repeated in his annals:
Year four. To the cities of Nikdime [and] Nikdiera I drew near. They became frightened
at my mighty, awe-inspiring weapons and my grim warfare, [and] cast themselves
upon the sea in wicker rn boats - . I followed after them in boats of - , fought a great
battle on the sea, defeated them, and with their blood I dyed the sea like wool.3
The city of Nikdime appears to be the city of Nikmed. Cities
were named in honor of their kings, and in this case it is put clearly,
"of Nikdime." The translator of this record also explained the words
"city of Nikdime" by a gloss: "personal name." The inversion of two
consonants, especially in personal names of foreign origin, is very
common among oriental peoples; thus, not far from Ras Shamra is
Iskanderun, a city named for Alexander. The city of Nikdime, like
the city of Nikmed, was situated close to the sea. It may be that
even Shalrnaneser's simile of the sea looking like dyed wool was
inspired by the trade of Ugarit-Ras Shamra. Factories for dyeing
wool had been established in Ugarit, and stores of crushed shells
prepared for the extraction of dye were found there. A written order
to tint three loads of wool also came to light.
Some time before his expulsion Nikmed, together with
Suppiluliuma, a contemporary city king, contributed to the goddess
of the city of Arne. We shall come across these names in the annals
of Shalmaneser, too.

Shalmaneser Is Opposed by a Syrian Coalition under Biridri
(Biridia), the Commandant of Megiddo
Shalmaneser relates that in his sixth year, two years after he drove
King Nikdem into the sea, a prince named Biridri, helped by a
coalition of twelve princes, opposed him at Karkar.1 Among
Biridri's allies were Ahab, the prince of Israel ("with two thousand



chariots and ten thousand warriors"), the city of Irqata (no prince is
named), the prince of Arvad, Matinu-Bali, the prince of Usa (not
named), and the prince of Siana, Adunu-Bali.
The inscription of Shalmaneser does not say that the allied
princes, Ahab among them, participated personally in the battle of
Karkar; it merely states: "These twelve kings he [Biridri] brought to
his support." We meet some of the same princes in the el-Amarna
letters. They wrote to the pharaoh that they were holding their
garrisons in readiness to take a stand against the invading king of
Hatti, and some of them - from northern Syria, which was more
immediately threatened than Palestine - might have taken part
personally in the battle.
The city of Irqata wrote to the pharaoh:
LETTER 100: Thus saith Irqata and the people of its inheritance.
. . Let the heart of the king, the lord, know that we protect Irqata for him. . . . Let the
breath of the king not depart from us. We have closed the gate until the breath of the
king comes to us. Powerful is the hostility against us, very powerful indeed.
In a letter from Rib-Addi2 it is reported: "Aduna -- of Irqata,
mercenaries have killed." In the same letter he wrote about the
wars of the king of Hatti in the northeast.
Prince Aduni of Siana of Shalmaneser's inscriptions was
probably Aduna "of - and of Irqata" of the el-Amarna letters. But if
Aduni of Shalmaneser's war annals was not the prince of Irqata,
then the failure of Shalmaneser to name the prince of Irqata is
explained by the el-Amarna letter: the prince of Irqata was killed,
and the city defended itself without choosing a new prince.
Two letters of Mut-Balu are preserved. He wrote to the pharaoh:
LETTER 255: Let the king, my lord, send caravans to Karaduniash. I will bring them
in so that they be completely safe.
Since Karaduniash is Babylon3 and the city of Mut-Balu is on the
way to Babylon, we may guess that Mut-Balu of the el-Amarna
letters was Matinu-Bali, the king of Arvad, mentioned in the
Assyrian inscription of Shalmanescr. Mut-Balu did not say from



where he wrote his letter. The Assyrian inscription, by calling
Matinu-Bali the king of Arvad, connects Mut-Balu of the letters with
that city. From Josephus, who quoted Menander,4 we have the
information that Mctten-Baal was a grandson of Ithobal Ethbaal
and a nephew of Jezebel.
Uzu (Usa ) was near Tyre. Tyre was on an island near the shore.
It did not have enough drinking water to withstand a siege. In those
rainless years the king of Tyre asked the pharaoh to transfer the city
of Uzu to the domain of Tyre.
LETTER 150: Let the king direct his attention towards his servant and give him Uzu in
order that he may live, and in order that he may drink water.
In both sources, in the inscription of Shalmaneser and in the
letters, we have met Irqata, Arvada, and Uzu as small principalities
opposing the invader corning from the north.
Megiddo was the strong military base behind these outposts. It
had been fortified by Thutmose III , whose campaign and victory at
Megiddo were emphasized in his annals. The city was a harrier in
the path of the armies corning from the north. Its garrison also
guarded the plain of Esdraelon ( Jezreel).
At the time of the el-Amarna letters a captain by the name of
Biridia was in command of Megiddo. It is obvious that a great
responsibility was placed on him at this time of uneasiness. Eight of
his letters have been found. Judged by them, he was a daring and
faithful soldier.
LETTER 243: And behold, I protect Maldda, the city of the king, my lord, day and
night. By day I guard from the fields. With chariots and soldiers I protect the walls of
the king, my lord.
It was to Megiddo that Ahaziah, the grandson of Jehoshaphat,
tried to escape when the rebellion of Jehu struck him unawares in
Jezreel. Megiddo, as the letters reveal, was a fortress, which Jehu
would not have dared to enter in his pursuit of Ahaziah. But
Ahaziah did not succeed in escaping: he was trapped and killed in
his flight to Megiddo (II Kings 9:27).



The walls of Megiddo, once a formidable structure, when
excavated were found to be very similar in construction and
workmanship to the walls of Ahab's palace at Samaria, dating from
the ninth century.5
Biridia, as commander of the most important fortress, was the
man to lead the coalition of the vassal kings against the "king of
Hatti."6 The rank and position of Biridia of the el-Amarna letters
correspond to those of Biridri of the Shalmaneser inscription. The
slightly different spelling of the names is due to the fact that not
only personal but even geographical names were spelled in the
letters in different ways: the same Biridia (in one instance he wrote
his name Biridi) announced to the pharaoh that he was defending
Makida; another time he wrote that he was defending Magiidda.
There are many similar examples in the letters.
Biridia, on watch at the stronghold of Megiddo, met the king of
Assyria, the enemy of the pharaoh, and it was the chariots under
his command that Shalmaneser took captive.
There were one thousand Musri soldiers in the army under
Biridri, who joined battle with the army of Shalmaneser at Karkar,
according to the record of Shalmaneser. Musri is the Assyrian name
for Egypt ( Mizraim in Hebrew). As it seemed unreasonable that the
Egyptian king should have sent only one tenth the soldiers that
Ahab sent, Musri was supposed to denote some realm other than
Egypt. One theory7 put it on the Sinai Peninsula; another8 located
it in northern Syria or in eastern Anatolia.
The letters of el-Amarna, when assigned to their proper time,
make these theories superfluous. The presence of a small
contingent of Egyptian soldiers in the allied army under Biridia is in
accord with the contents of the el-Amarna letters. Biridia also sent
regular reports to the pharaoh about his preparations to meet the
king of Hatti on the battlefield.
In a number of letters the king of Sumur reported to the pharaoh
the danger impending from the king of Hatti. In an early letter he
wrote: "Let the king, my lord, know that the king of Hatti has



overcome all lands, which belonged to the king of Mitta or the king
of Nahma - the land of the great kings. Abdi-Ashirta, the slave, the
dog, has gone with him."9 The successes of the king of Hatti in
Mitanni (Mitta) were only temporary, for King Tushratta of Mitanni,
the father-in-law of the pharaoh, was able to send, among other
numerous and rich presents, some of "the booty of the land of
Hatti," and by this he let his son-in-law know that he was not
defeated. The records of Shalmaneser, aside from his conquest of
Babylon at the time of a dynastic war between two Babylonian
princes, do not chronicle any decisive victory or permanent
territorial acquisition in the cast.
Almost every year during the first two decades of his reign
Shalmaneser renewed his southern campaigns into Syria. In the el
Amarna correspondence the vassals of Egypt in northern Syria
reported to the pharaoh the raids of the king of Haiti.
These raids were accompanied by holocausts. In one of his later
letters Rib-Addi wrote: "I have heard from [about] the Hatti people
that they burn the lands with fire. I have repeatedly written . . ,
All lands of the king, my lord, are conquered . . . they bring
soldiers from the Hatti lands to conquer Gubla."10 Rib-Addi in this
letter expressed his fear that the attack would be directed against
him. His information that the king of Hatti burned cities to the
ground was true. Shalmaneser himself wrote: "I destroyed, I
devastated, I burned with fire," a statement he often repeated; after
his sixteenth march into Syria he perpetuated his deeds with these
words: "Countless cities I destroyed, I devastated, I burned with
fire."
The same was reported in many letters of Syrian city-princes to
the pharaoh.
Rib-Addi in a still later lette11 wrote about the exploits of the king
of Hatti, but these lines are destroyed, and we can read among the
defaced characters only the words "king of the Hatti lands."
Shalmaneser, the Assyrian king of the ninth century, was, ac
cording to this reconstruction of history, the king of Hatti of the el



Amarna letters. After he secured the domain he inherited from his
father, Assurnasirpal, and increased it by the conquest of Babylon
and of other areas, he wrote:
The land of Hatti to its farthest border I brought under my sway. From the source of
the Tigris to the source of the Euphrates my hands conquered.12
Hatti is here apparently a broad geographical designation, not an
ethnographical name.
When the Syrians under the walls of Samaria thought they heard
an army approaching to relieve the city, they imagined that it was
either the army of Egypt or of Hatti (II Kings 7:6). The latter means,
apparently, the army of Shalmaneser. He put all other countries in
a state of defense, and the pharaoh was regarded as his only real
rival. Their rivalry in matters of Syria is perfectly reflected in the el
Amarna letters.

the chief of the coalition, Biridri, was supposed to have been Ben Hadad, the most

The identification of Ben-Hadad and Biridri gave rise to the question: Why did Ahab come
to the help of Ben-Hadad, his enemy, at Karkar? It was conjectured that Ben-Hadad
conducted his war against Ahab to compel him to participate in the war against
Shalmaneser.

Shalmaneser Invades Amuru Land and Is Opposed by the
King of Damascus
In the tenth year of his reign Shalmaneser fought against another
coalition, again under Biridri (Biridia). When Biridri died, Hazael,
exploiting the absence of an Egyptian governor, killed his own
father.
In Egypt, Aziru (Hazael) was suspected of being on the side of
"the king of Hatti" - as his father at one time had been 1 - for he
received messengers from the king of Hatti. At the same time he
begged the pharaoh to confirm his status as king of Damascus, the
throne of which he had usurped. He was summoned to Egypt, but
he repeatedly delayed his departure with the excuse that the
movements of the king of Hatti had to be watched: "If the king of
Hatti comes for hostility against me, then, 0 king, my lord, give me
soldiers and chariots for my assistance." But he was questioned:
"Why bast thou taken care of the messengers of the king of Hatti?
But thou hast not taken care of my messengers?" A long and
interesting letter from the pharaoh to him is preserved. The royal
ax would cut off his head and the heads of his brothers2 if he took
the side of the enemies of the pharaoh. But he would be in favor if
faithful (Letter 162).
Aziru ( IIazael ) was "exceedingly glad" with "the pleasing and
good" words of the pharaoh, but he coud not comply with the
invitation to come to Egypt. His double-dealing angered the king of
Hatti too. Aziru ( Hazael ) wrote to his protector, Dudu: "But, 0 my
lord, the king of IIatte is come to Nuhassel Therefore I cannot
come. May the king of Hatte depart." In a letter to the pharaoh he
conceded that he had "arrived formerly to the king from [of]
Hatte,"3 but now he looks only in the face of the sun, his lord (
Alchnaton). "And the king of Hatte comes to Amurri, the land of
the king, my lord . . . for now he dwells in Nuhasse, two one-day's



journey to Tunip,4 and I am afraid that he will oppress Tunip. Let
him depart"5 "I am afraid of him; I watch lest he come up to
Amurri. . . . So I fear him."6
We must now look into the annals of Shalmaneser to see
whether he really came to Amurri, and whether he threatened
Hazael (Aziru)
In the letters of the kings of the Syrian cities we read about the
awe Shalmaneser inspired in that country; it is also mentioned in
his own annals: "The kings of the land of Amuru, all of them,
became terrified at the approach of my mighty, awe-inspiring
weapons."7 He calls the land of Syria by the name applied to it in
the el-Amarna letters - Amuru (Amurri). The annals of
Shalmaneser also verify what was said in the el-Amarna letters
concerning Hazael (Aziru): "In my eighteenth year of reign, I
crossed the Euphrates for the sixteenth time. Hazael of Aram
[Amuru] came forth to battle." He wrote that Hazael made his
stand at Mount Senir ( Anti-Lebanon ), "Mount Saniru, a mountain
peak which is in front of Mount Lebanon." This strategic position of
Hazael protected Tunip (Baalbek). In the battle Shalmaneser
captured 1121 chariots. "As far as Damascus, his royal city, I
advanced. His orchards I cut down."
Four years later Shalmaneser, according to his annals, went
"against the cities of Hazael of Aram [Amuru]" and "captured four
of his cities?'

The Phoenicians Leave for a New Home
From the annals of Shalmaneser we know that he subjugated the
seacoast of Syria as far as Tyre. The Assyrian terror and the heavy
tribute forced the Phoenicians to look for a new home, and a
number of them left Tyre and other cities, went to the North African
shore halfway along the Mediterranean, and founded there the
colony of Carthage.1
As we look for further mention of the military activities of
Shalmaneser in the letters of el-Amarna, it is only reasonable that
we should direct our attention to the letters written from Tyre.
Abimilki, king of Tyre, wrote several tablets to the pharaoh,
reassuring him:
LETTER 147: Behold, I protect Tyre, the great city, for the king, my lord.
And again,
LETTER 149: The king, my lord, has appointed me to protect Tyre, the handmaid of
the king.
The pharaoh requested Abimilki to give him information about
the cities of Syria. Abimilki wrote that Aziru (Hazael) had
conquered Sumura ( Samaria ); that the city of Danuna in Syria
was quiet ( Shalmaneser passed through this city in his second year
- he called it Dihnunu); Abimilki also wrote that half the city of
Ugarit was destroyed by fire, that the other half of the city was
despoiled, and that the soldiers of the Hatti army had left there.
Shalmaneser captured Ugarit, the city of Nikdem, in the fourth
year of his reign. With the fall of Danuna and Ugarit to
Shalmaneser, the position of Tyre was very much endangered,
especially because of the feud between that city and Sidon as
reflected in the el-Amarna letters, and also because of the pillaging
tribes that approached Tyre from across the Jordan. Tyre on the
rock was dependent on the coast not only for water supply but also
for the wood necessary in shipbuilding.



In his plight Abimilki wrote that he was a "serf of tears" and
pleaded for help. And when finally he received word that the fleet
of the pharaoh would arrive at Tyre he sent out his mariners to
meet the Egyptian navy. He was encouraged for a while and wrote
again that he would defend the city. But the help was insufficient
and too late, if it came at all.
In the eighteenth year of his reign Shalmaneser wrote that he
had received "the tribute of the men of Tyre, Sidon, and of Jehu, of
the house of Omri."
In his last letter to the pharaoh Abimilki changed the manner he
had used in writing his previous letters. He used to tell the pharaoh
that he, the august overlord, "thundereth in the heavens like Adad."
It should be noted here that this was the same attribute that
Shalmaneser in his inscriptions applied to himself: "I thundered like
Adad, the Storm-god." Shalmaneser also wrote, "Shalmaneser, the
mighty king, the sun of all peoples." Akhnaton and Shalmaneser
both claimed to be the sun, and before long Abimilki knew that
there were two suns, a violent one in the Two-Stream Land and an
inactive one in Egypt.
Abimilki still paid respect to the pharaoh and called him "the
eternal sun," but in his long last letter he no longer wrote to the
pharaoh as to the sole sovereign, and it was clearly made known to
the pharaoh that Abimilki also bowed before another lord.
LETTER 155: The king is sun for ever. The king has commanded that there be given
to his servant and to the servant of Shalmaiati breath, and that there be given water
for him to drink. But they have not done what the king, my lord, commanded. They
have not given it. So, then, let the Icing care for the servant of Shalmajati that water be
given for the sake of his life. Further: let my lord, the king, as there is no wood, no
water, no straw, no earth, no place for the dead, let the king, my lord, care for the
servant of Shalmajati that life be given to him.
Bizarre conjectures were published to explain the meaning of
that perplexing name Shalmaiati. Without taking into consideration
the contemporaneous account of Shalmaneser, who in his
eighteenth year received tribute from Tyre and Sidon, the change
in the overlordship of Tyre is easily misunderstood. Shalmaiati



could not be another name of the pharaoh, because Abimilki called
himself Pharaoh's servant and the servant of Shalmaiati. It was also
proposed2 that the word be read "Maya-ati" and to identify it with
Meryt-aten, a daughter of Akhnaton. It has been admitted that the
evidence for this and similar explanations is defective.3 Then it was
said that Shalmaiati was a god, and a hypothesis was constructed
according to which ancient Jerusalem and Tyre both worshiped a
deity Salem and this deity was called Shalmaiati by Abimilki. It was
observed, however, that a sign which usually accompanied the
name of a deity was missing every time Shalmaiati was named in
the letter. Who, then, could he have been? And yet, in disregard of
both facts - that Shalmaiati and the pharaoh could not be the same
person, and that Shalmaiati could not be a deity - it was supposed
that Shalmaiati was the name of a god, equivalent to the sun or
Aton of Akimaton, but that here this god is invoked as an alter ego
of Akhnaton, which makes the sign of divinity unnecessary, and yet
is an indication of a second personality.4
Abimilki's last letter is not yet ended. What should we like to read
in it? Of course, about the departure of the people of Tyre and
other Phoenician cities on their ships from the grievous yoke of
Shalmaneser and from the recurrent drought, to look for a new
haven along the shores of the Mediterranean. We know that it was
in the days of Shalmaneser and in fear of him that the refugees
from Tyre and other Phoenician cities fled and laid the foundations
of Carthage.
This last letter of Abimilki closes with the words:
LETTER 155: Let the king set his face towards his servant and Tyre the city of
Shalmaiati . . Behold, the man of Beruta [Beirut] has gone in a ship, and the man of
Zidon goes away in two ships, and I go away with all thy ships and my whole city.
The dramatic meaning of this letter becomes evident. Abimilki
wrote that he would desert his rocky island and evacuate the
population of Tyre. He begged the pharaoh to take care of what
would remain in the deserted city, which was bound by tribute to a
king invader.

Who Is the Dreaded "King of Hatti" of the el-Amarna
Correspondence?
The king of Hatti, always feared and often mentioned in the letters
of the Syrian princes, might well have been one of the
correspondents of the el-Amarna collection. Although in continued
conflict with Egypt, he never made open war against the pharaoh;
at least the pharaoh never sent a strong army to the assistance of
his Syrian vassals. It is probable, therefore, that they exchanged
letters. It is generally accepted that Suppiluliuma, of whom only
one very amiable letter is preserved, was the feared king of Hatti. A
number of generations later another Suppiluliuma was "a king of
Hatti" and therefore it appeared reasonable that Suppiluliuma of
the el-Amarna period also had been a great king of Hatti.
Actually, in the time of Shalmaneser III (in the ninth century)
there lived a prince called Suppiluliuma (Sapalulme), to whom
Shalmaneser referred in his annals.1 He could have been the
author of the letter in the el-Amarna collection signed with his
name.2
In a short and broken text from Ugarit referring to donations
made to the goddess of the city of Arne, Prince Nikmed of
UgaritRas Shamra as well as Suppiluliuma are mentioned.3
Apparently Nikmed and Suppiluliuma, too, donated to the goddess
of Arne. Arne was not far from Ugarit and was captured by
Shalmaneser in one of his campaigns. "Against the cities of Arame
(personal name) I drew near. Arne his royal city I captured."4



Besides establishing the identity of Shalmaneser and the king of
Hatti, the invader from the north at the time of the el-Amarna
correspondence, there is a basis for suggesting an identification of
the king of Hatti as one of the el-Amarna correspondents. We have
already shown that he is mentioned in the letters of the king of Tyre
by the name of Shalmaiati; but no letter is signed with this name.
Inasmuch as Shalmaneser was king of Assyria, who also became
king of Babylon by intrigue and conquest, and Burnaburiash
(Burnaburiash ) is the name of the king who wrote from Babylon
and who referred in his letters to the Assyrians as his subjects,5
most probably Burnaburiash is the alter ego of Shalmaneser the
Assyrian. It is well known from many instances that in Nineveh and
in Babylon the king used various names.6
Shalmaneser wrote of himself: "Shalmaneser, the mighty king,
king of the universe, the king without a rival, the autocrat . . . who
shatters the might of the princes of the whole world, who has
smashed all of his foes like pots, the mighty hero, the unsparing."
It also seems that Shalmaneser alone in his time would have
written in the manner of Burnaburiash. Burnaburiash was very
haughty and wrote letters often bordering on insult. Under the
pretext of an indisposition he refused to grant an audience to the
messenger of the pharaoh ("his messenger has never eaten food
nor drunk date wine in my presence"); then, although the pharaoh
was the injured party, Burnaburiash said that he was angry - "I
poured forth my wrath toward my brother" - because he had not
received the message of solicitude to which an indisposed
sovereign was entitled. But when he was informed, through the
close questioning of his own messenger, that the road was long and
that in the short period of time Pharaoh could not have responded
to the news of his indisposition, he added to the same letter: "I no
longer poured forth to thee my wrath." Then be found fault with
the pharaoh's gifts: "The forty minas of gold which they brought
when I put them in the furnace, did not come out full weight." He
called on him "to make good his loss" of a caravan plundered in
Syria. "Khinshi is thy land and its kings are thy servants," therefore



"bind them, and the money which they have stolen, make good."
He also wrote: "Do not retain my messenger, let him come quickly."
He ordered various art objects to be made and sent to him as
presents: "Let experts, who are with thee, make animals, either of
land or of river, as if they were alive; the skin, may it be made as if
it were alive." He also sent presents, but remarked: "For the mistress
of thy house I have sent only twenty seal rings of beautiful lapis
lazuli because she has not done anything for me. . . ."
This manner of writing to the pharaoh is unique in the el
Amarna collection. All clues point to the identification of
Burnaburiash with Shalmaneser of the Assyrian inscriptions, with
Shalmaiati of the letter of the king of Tyre, and with the "king of
Hatti."
There exists a very long register of gifts sent by Akhnaton to
Burnaburiash.7 After an extensive enumeration of objects of gold,
silver, precious stones, and ivory, the list mentions animals, but this
part is defaced, and only "ibex" (durah) is discernible. The list gives
the impression of being tribute rather than a gift, and the letters of
Burnaburiash indicate that gifts delivered in excessive quantities
were not made on an entirely voluntary basis. Treasures found in
the tomb of Tutankhamen, the son-in-law of Akhnaton, are
unequaled by any other archaeological discovery in Egypt or
elsewhere, but they are trifles compared with the presents
Akhnaton sent to Burnaburiash. The list opens with the words:
LETTER 14: These are the objects which Naphururia, the great king, king of Egypt
[sar Miisrii] sent to his brother Burnaburiash the great king, king of Karaduniash
[Babylon].
Shalmaneser pictured on an obelisk the presentation of the
tribute from various lands. One of these lands was Musri ( Egypt) :
"Tribute of the land of Musri." In addition to gold, and more
appreciated than this metal, there were rare animals described as
camels with two humps, a river ox, and other land and water
creatures, some of which are depicted. It is conceivable that these



were figures of animals "of land and river" in compliance with the
demand expressed in the quoted letter.
Briefly summarizing the parallels between the annals of Shal
maneser and the el-Amarna letters concerning the king of Matti, we
find the following:
The record of the fourth-year campaign of Shalmaneser against
Nikdem (Nikmed ) has its counterpart in a letter of the king of
Tyre and in a proclamation found in Ugarit-Ras Shamra.
Shalmaneser's repeated campaigns in Syria - he himself mentioned
sixteen marches during the first eighteen years of his reign - are told
in many of the el-Amarna letters, especially in those written from
the cities in northern Syria.
Shalmaneser wrote that "the land of Hatti to its farthest border I
brought under my sway." He wrote also, "I received gifts from all
the kings of Hatti."8 In the letters of el-Amarna the invading king is
called "the king of Hatti." His destruction of numerous cities by fire
is mentioned in his inscriptions and also in the letters of el-Amarna;
vestiges of the conflagration are visible in the ruins of Ugarit. "The
chilling terror" of his arms, which, according to his annals, filled the
kings of the land of Amuru, finds expression in many letters.
Cities and princes who wrote to the pharaoh about the approach
of the invader are also mentioned in the annals of Shalmaneser as
those who, with the assistance of Egypt (Musri), fought against him
in the sixth year of his reign. They fought again in his eleventh
year, and once more in his fourteenth year. From the commander
of this coalition, Biridri of the Assyrian annals, or Biridia of the
letters ( written also Biridi), there are military reports to the pharaoh
about his preparations for defense against the aggressor.
The tributary status to which Shalmaneser, in his eighteenth year,
reduced the cities of Tyre and Sidon, and the departure of their
population on ships for a new haven, are described in the last letter
of the king of Tyre. Shalmaneser's march against Hazael in the
same year is related in the former's annals and is reported in the
letters of Hazael (Aziru). Hazael's stand at Anti-Lebanon (Senir ) is



also recorded both in the annals and in the el-Amarna letters. The
letters likewise mention the king of Hatti's (Shalmaneser's) wars in
the region of Mesopotamia.
The el-Amarna letters describe, and the obelisk of Shalmaneser
exhibits, the presents of gold and rare animals sent from Egypt.

Idioms of the el-Amarna Letters
The el-Amarna letters were written in cuneiform characters in
Babylonian (Akkadian) with many "Syrian idioms." Having been
written in the days of Jehoshaphat, king of Jerusalem, their manner
of expression, a characteristic of every land and every age, should
be expected to resemble the manner of expression in the earlier
books of the prophets, for only a hundred years separate
Jehoshaphat from Amos, the prophet.
The similarity of expression in the el-Amarna letters from
Palestine and in the prophets and psalmists did not pass unnoticed,
and identical turns of speech were detected and stressed. Here are
some examples.1
Loyalty is expressed by the metaphor, "to lay the neck to the
yoke and bear it," in the letters of Yakhtiri (Iahtiri) and Baal-miir2
and similarly in Jeremiah 27:11f.



The submission of the enemy is described in the words, "to eat
dust," in the letter of the men of Irqata as well as in Isaiah 49:23.
The king's "face" is against a man, or the king "casts down" a
man's face, or he throws the man out of his hand - thus, in letters
of Rib-Addi (Ahab) and in Genesis 19:21 and I Samuel 25:29.
RibAddi's "face is friendly toward the king"; "he has directed his
face towards the glory of the king, and would see his gracious
face." "Biblical ideas of 'face' and 'presence' will be at once
recalled."
"Just as Ikhnaton's [Akhnaton] hymn reminds us of Psalm 104,
so Psalm 139:7f. is suggested by the words of Tagi (Letter 264): "As
for us, consider! My two eyes are upon thee. If we go up into
heaven (shamema), or if we descend into the earth, yet is our head
(rushunu) in thine hands.'"
"The footstool of his feet" is an expression found in a letter and in
Psalm 110. Akhi-Yavvi writes, "A brother art thou and love is in thy
bowels and in thy heart," similar to Jeremiah 4:19. "The city weeps
and its tears run down, and there is none taking hold of our hand"
(i.e., helper) - these words, written by the men of Dunip (Tunip ),
remind us of Lamentations 1:2 and Isaiah 42:6.
Rib-Addi's appeals to the pharaoh's good name contain turns of
speech used also in Deuteronomy 9:27f. and in Joshua 7:9. When
he wishes to say that he confessed his sins, he uses the words,
"opened his sins,"3 an expression also found in Proverbs 28:13.
When he writes that he will die "if there is not another heart" in the
king, he uses an expression also found in I Samuel 10:9 and
Ezekiel 11:19.
The king of Jerusalem wrote to Pharaoh that "because he has his
name upon Jerusalem for ever, the city cannot be neglected,"
words that remind us of a passage in Jeremiah 14:9. Again, he
wrote: "See! the king, my lord, has set his name at the rising of the
sun and at the setting of the sun," a parallel to which may be found
in Malachi 1:11.



These and similar parallels moved the scholar who brought them
together to write: "The repeated lyrical utterances of Rib-Addi and
Abdi-Khiba are early examples of the unrestrained laments of the
later Israelites who appeal, not to a divine king of Egypt, their
overlord, but to Yahweh."4 By establishing this, the author hit on
only half the truth. Iie emphasized the similarity of the expressions
and he was right; but, compelled by the conventional chronology,
he regarded this fact as proof that the Canaanites, seven or eight
hundred years before the Israelite prophets and scribes, had used
the same peculiar expressions - and he was wrong.
The assumed heritage of the Canaanite culture in art and
literature was actually an Israelite creation. The proofs of the
continuity of culture in Palestine (before and after the conquest by
the Israelites) are vanishing.
To this list of comparisons, taken from the research of another,
may be added all those expressions that we have found to be
identical in the letters and in the dialogues and monologues of the
Books of Kings and Chronicles in the chapters dealing with the
period of Ahab and Jehoshaphat, and which we compared earlier
in these pages. We compared even the forms of speech of
Jehoshaphat with similar constructions in the letters of the king of
Jerusalem; expressions of the scriptural Ahab with expressions in
the letters of the king of Sumura; and we found every sentence of
the biblical dialogue of Hazael preserved in the letters of Aziru and
in letters about him.
It is easy to expand this collection, for there is not a monologue
or dialogue in the pertinent chapters of Kings and Chronicles that
does not have turns of speech which are also in the el-Amarna
letters. The conventional form of respectful address, such as "the
king, my lord," "my father," "thy son," "thy brother"; peculiar
expressions, such as, "But what, is thy servant a dog, that he
should do this?"5 or "our eyes are upon thee";'6 and common
idioms, such as "let go out of thine hand,"7 are found in el-Amarna



letters and in the chapters of Kings and Chronicles dealing with the
period of Ahab and Jehoshaphat.
The art of writing on clay was developed and exchange of letters
was common in the days of Jehoshaphat and Ahab. Jezebel sent
letters to the elders of Jezreel inviting them to bring false witness
against Naboth. Ben-Hadad sent a letter to the king of Israel asking
him to heal Naaman. Jehu, after the success of the conspiracy in
Jezreel, twice sent letters to the elders of Samaria.
The el-Amarna letters provide us with ample evidence that
employment of scribes and the writing of letters was rather
common in the Palestine of that time. They prove also that in the
Palestine of Ahab and Jehoshaphat scribes read and wrote
cuneiform in addition to Hebrew. This confirms the theory
advanced at the beginning of this century8 that cuneiform was
being written in Palestine at the time when the annals, later used by
the editor of the biblical texts, were composed.
The excavations in Samaria brought to light two tablets in
cuneiform. One of them contains these words: ". . . say Abiahi to
the governor of the cities to deliver six oxen, twelve sheep"; the
other tablet is almost obliterated. They have a Hebrew seal!9 A
Hebrew scribe must have written them. The exact date of these
tablets from the palace at Samaria is not known. The palace was
built early in the ninth century and destroyed late in the eighth
century.

5 The dog" means also a male prostitute. Cf. Deuteronomy 23:18.
The expression, "Is thy servant a dog that he shall not . ." is also found in letters of Lachish,
the modern Tell ed Duweir, in southern Palestine. These letters were written shortly before
the destruction of the first Temple.

The Age of Ivory
The period of the el-Amarna correspondence might quite properly
be called the "ivory age." Next to gold, the desideratum of all ages,
objects of ivory were the most coveted, and with lapis lazuli they
are the most frequently mentioned royal presents. Lapis lazuli was
sent by the kings of Asia to the pharaohs Amenhotep and
Akhnaton; objects, and especially furniture, of ivory or inlaid with
ivory were requested of the pharaohs by these kings.
Amenhotep III wrote to the king of Arzawa in Asia Minor: "Ten
chairs of ebony, inlaid with ivory and lapis lazuli . . . I have
dispatched."1 And Tushratta, the king of Mitanni, wrote to
Amenhotep III: "And let my brother give three statues of ivory."
Burnaburiash, writing from Babylon, asked for objects of ivory:
LETTER 11.: Let trees be made of ivory and colored! Let field plants be made of
ivory and colored . . . and let them be brought!
The list of presents sent by Amenhotep IV (Akhnaton) to
Burnaburiash displays the "ivory age" before the eyes of the reader.
Here are a few passages from this list:
LETTER 14: Eight umninu of ebony inlaid with ivory
Two umninu of ebony inlaid with ivory. . . .
- Of ebony, inlaid with ivory.
Six beast-paws of ivory
nine plants of ivory,
ten - which are - of ivory
twenty-nine gherkin oil-vessels of ivory,
. forty-four oil vessels . . . of ivory,
three hundred and seventy-five oil vessels of ivory
19 gasu, of ivory - .



19 breast ornaments, of ivory
13 umninu of ivory
3 for the head, of ivory
3 bowls of ivory
3 oil-containing oxen, of ivory,
3 oil - dushahu, of ivory
of ivory . . . of ivory . . . of ivory . . .
The present research has established the fact that King Ahab was
a contemporary of Amenhotep III and Akhnaton, and that Samaria
was built with the help of the king of Egypt. In Samaria a house of
ivory was built:
II KINGS 22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory
house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
A few generations after Ahab, Amos, the prophet, prophesied
about Israel and about Samaria, the capital, and the buildings
therein:
AMOS 3:15 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses
of ivory shall perish. . . .
And again he returned to prophesy evil "to them that are at ease
in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria."
AMOS 6:4-5 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches .
. . That chant to the sound of the viol . . .
The house of ivory and beds of ivory were supposed by earlier
excavators to have been poetic inventions of the authors of the
Scriptures.2 But later excavations made on the site of ancient
Samaria brought to light "hundreds of fragments of ivory."3 They
were identified as objects of jewelry, pieces of furniture, and
ornamental work.4 It can be established with exactitude that the
time in which these objects originated was that of Ahab. Ivory
fragments inscribed with Hebrew letters bear witness to this
conclusion: a comparison of these letters with the characters of the
Mesha inscription showed that they originated at one and the same
time.5



The excavators felt justified in writing: "No other finds have told
us so much about the art of the Israelite monarchy."6
On some of these objects there are Egyptian designs, and the
Egyptian double crown, clearly cut, was found on several of the
plates.7 A student of the Bible would expect to find Assyrian motifs
because of Assyrian domination in the north of Syria in the ninth
century before this era, not a predominance of Egyptian influence
in art at a time when, according to his table of chronology, arts
were not cherished in the Egypt of the ignoble successors of
Shoshenk (Sosenk) of the Twenty-second Dynasty, long after the
brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. The excavators of Samaria were
surprised: "It is significant that in our ivories there is no sign of
Assyrian influence," and "the influence of Egypt on the other hand
is all-pervasive."8 There are plaques which represent Egyptian
gods; the subjects on furniture "are all Egyptian."9
By synchronizing the time of Akhnaton with that of Ahab, we
realize that the part Egypt played in Samaria in the days of the el
Amarna letters makes the presence of Egyptian motifs and furniture
styles in the ivory of Samaria very understandable. We are even in
a position to compare the ivory finds in Samaria with those in
Egypt at the time of Akhnaton. "Winged figures in human form"
were found in Samaria. "The forms of winged figures on the ivories
. . . are derived from Egyptian models. Tutelary goddesses of this
type stand at the four corners of the shrine of Tutenkhamun."10
Three winged sphinxes with human heads were also found in
Samaria,and they, too, were recognized as similar to the human
headed lion from the tomb of Tutankhamen.11
Tutankhamen was a son-in-law of Akhnaton. The presence of
similar figures on his sarcophagus and in the Samaria of Ahab is,
from our point of view, not unexpected.
The excavators of Samaria's ivories, observing the style of the
ornaments, recognize the influence of Egyptian art but think that in
the days of Ahab a restoration of ancient forms in art took place,



the "Egypt of yesterday" having been revived in Samaria after six
hundred years.
In the same ornaments of Samarian ivory could be recognized
motifs of the type described in the Scriptures, such as palm trees
"between a cherub and a cherub" (Ezekiel 41:18). "Some of the
figures [of the ivories of Samaria] . . . were like those which were
carved on the House of the Lord in Jerusalem."12 The conclusion
arrived at was that the style of the ornaments in the Temple at
Jerusalem represented an intermediate stage in the succession of
influences. "The type goes back to the Egyptian art of the
Eighteenth Dynasty."13
The place of origin of the style - Egypt or Palestine - can be
disputed. Probably a reciprocal influence was the inspiration for the
motifs on the ornaments. One fact, however, reverses all
conclusions in the study of the comparative art of Egypt-Palestine:
the Eighteenth Dynasty ruled from the days of Saul until Jehu, and
the great temples of Luxor and Karnak, creations of Thutmose III
and Amenhotep III, were built not before but after the Temple in
Jerusalem was erected.
In the time of Solomon ivory was imported from distant
countries, along with silver, apes, and peacocks. From Palestine it
was exported to Egypt, and Hatshepsut brought ivory with her as
the bas-reliefs of the Punt expedition show and the texts
accompanying the bas-reliefs tell. Pharaoh Thutmose III, on
plundering Megiddo in his campaign of conquest, took, according
to his annals, "six large tables of ivory and six chairs of ivory"
besides other spoils. The pharaoh brought from Jerusalem "the
great throne of ivory, overlaid with pure gold" - this according to
the Hebrew sources (II Chronicles 9:17; 12:9 ). In the eighth
campaign Thutmose III took tribute including "vessels laden with
ivory." In the records of the tribute he received in Punt, God's
Land, or Rezenu (Palestine) there is frequent mention of ivory in
tusks ( thus, eighteen tusks from the chiefs of Rezenu in the
sixteenth collection of tribute) and in furniture ( tables of ivory in
the thirteenth collection of tribute). After enlarging his fleet with the



fleet of the Phoenicians, he sent his ships to collect tribute and, like
Hatshepsut before him, used the maritime route for transport of
ivory from Palestine to Egypt.
The art of working in ivory was transferred at that time to Egypt.
In the tomb of Rekhmire, a vizier of Thutmose III, workers from
Palestine are portrayed "making chests of ivory" - these were
imported craftsmen.
Samaria, built a few decades later, became a manufacturing
center of ivory, working mainly for Egypt. Among the ivories
excavated in Samaria there are many unfinished pieces with
Egyptian patterns.
Color effects were produced by staining the ivory with
pigments.14 Colored ivory was also found in the tomb of
Tutankhamen. In an el-Amarna letter of Burnaburiash we read
about colored ivory.
The tablets of el-Amarna mention furniture and various objects
of ivory delivered to Asia Minor, Cyprus, Assyria, and other
countries of western Asia. Objects similar to those found in
Samaria were discovered in these lands.
In the last century inlaid plaques with Egyptian subjects were
found in Mesopotamia. When the ivories of Samaria were
unearthed they were acclaimed as closely related to those found
previously in the palace of Nimrud and in other places: ivories
which "may have come from the same workshop as the Samaria
ivories, were found by Layard in the northwest palace at Nimrud; a
few stray examples come from other sites."15
Ivories similar to those of Samaria have been found in a number
of different places, sometimes together with Egyptian objects of the
Eighteenth Dynasty. One of these places is Megiddo. Though the
ivories of Samaria and Megiddo show the same patterns and the
same workmanship, they were ascribed to two different periods.16
Similarly, other discoveries of ivory were attributed by their finders
either to the period of the Eighteenth Dynasty ( the fifteenth and
fourteenth centuries) or to the period of the kings of Samaria ( the



ninth and eighth centuries ).17 The second period is thought to
have been the age of imitation of old Egyptian styles and of the
renais sance of the old craft.
They were but one and the same period, and the ivories of the
Samaria of Ahab and of the Thebes of Tutankhamen are products
of one and the same golden age of ivory art.

Conclusions
If one is determined to keep to the traditional construction of
history and insist that the letters of el-Amarna were written to and
from archaic Canaanite princes, he is also bound to maintain that



in Canaan events occurred which recurred half a millennium later
in the time of Jehoshaphat and Ahab. This makes it necessary to
hold that there already was a city of Sumur, of which not a relic
remained; that this city, with a royal palace and fortified walls, was
repeatedly besieged by a king of Damascus, who had a prolonged
dispute and recurrent wars with the king of Sumur over a number
of cities, in a conflict that endured for a number of decades; that on
one occasion the king of Sumux captured the king of Damascus
but released him; that on the occasion of a siege of Sumur by the
king of Damascus the guard attached to the governors succeeded
in driving away the Syrian host from the walls of Sumur; that on
the occasion of another siege of Sumur the Syrian host, hearing
rumors of the arrival of the Egyptian archers, left their camp and
fled - every detail an exact image of what happened again half a
millennium later at the walls of Samaria.
The traditional construction of history implies also that the king
of Damascus, who was at the head of a coalition of many Arabian
chieftains, succeeded in fomenting a revolt by a Trans-Jordan king
named Mesh against the king of Sumur, whose vassal he was, and
this rebellious vassal king captured cities of the king of Sumur and
humiliated his people, as in the days of Mesha's rebellion against
the king of Samaria. That Rimuta was the place in dispute between
the king of Damascus and the king of Sumur, as Ramoth was in the
second epoch; that the king of Sumur had a second residence
where a deity was worshiped whose name, Baalith, was the same
as that of the deity introduced by Jezebel, and the king of Sumur
planted groves in his second residence, like Ahab in the field of
Naboth; that the king of Damascus organized a number of
ambuscades against the king of Sumur, and the king of Sumur
each time managed to escape death, like the king of Samaria of the
second period; that the king of Damascus became gravely ill, yet
did not die from the illness but was put to a violent death on his
sickbed, like the king of Damascus of the second period.
This hypothetical scholar would also be bound to admit that all
these coincidences happened at a time when the land of Sumur



was visited by a drought, and the springs dried up and a severe
famine followed; that the drought lasted several years and caused
starvation of the people and epidemics among the domestic
animals; and that the inhabitants departed from the realm of the
two residences - everything just as it happened in the second
period.
He would have to maintain that the two periods do not differ in
any respect whatsoever, and that each event of one period has its
twin in the other. The land of Edam was ruled by a deputy of the
king of Jerusalem - in both cases. Tribes from as far away as Mount
Seir invaded Trans-Jordan - in both cases. In the first period as in
the second, the invaders threatened Jerusalem and caused the
population of the kingdom to flee from their homes. The king of
Jerusalem, like Jehoshaphat centuries later, was afraid of being
driven with his people from their inheritance and expressed his fear
in similar terms, but everything turned out well when the tribes of
Mount Seir and Trans-Jordan rose up one against the other, as they
did five to six hundred years later.
This scholar would also have to admit that the military chiefs of
the Canaanite king of Jerusalem signed their letters with the same
names as the military chiefs of Jehoshaphat, Icing of Jerusalem,
and that the names were as peculiar and unusual as, for example,
Ishzibada (Jehozabad) and "son of Zuchru" ("son of Zichri"), or
Addaia (Adaia), or Adadanu (Adadani, Adna), who was again the
first among the chiefs; that the governor of Sumur had the same
name as the governor of Samaria of the later period (Amon), and
that the keeper of the palace in Sumur was named Arzaia like the
chief steward, Arza, of the king of Israel.
Again, in the city of Shunem (Shunama) lived a "great lady," and
already in the first period some miracle had happened to her so
that she was called Baalat-Nese.
And again, the king of Damascus had a military governor
(Naaman, Ianhama), by whose hand "deliverance was given to
Syria," and who at first was feared by the king of Sumur but later



on became the latter's friend, like his reincarnation six hundred
years later.
Further, the successor of the murdered king of Damascus, by the
name of Aziru or Azaru, acted like Hazael of the second period: he
oppressed the land of Sumur; he conquered almost all the land of
the realm; he burned with fire the strongholds and villages of the
king of Sumur; he even spoke with the same peculiar expressions
as Hazael did later on.
This scholar would also be faced with the fact that in the second
period the city of Irqata again lost her king, and that King
MatinuBali and King Adunu-Bali, under the leadership of Biridri,
defied the mighty invader from the north, just as happened in the
first period when a Biridi (Biridi) assumed the task of leading the
kingless city of Irqata and King Mut-Balu and King Aduna against
the invader from the north. In both cases this invader was the king
of Assyria and the lord of Hatti. In both cases he was victorious
over the coalition of Syrian and Palestinian princes helped by
Egyptian battalions. In both cases he received placating presents
from Musri (Egypt) in the form of rare animals or figures of such
animals. Again, the king of Damascus, Hazael, battled with him
between Lebanon and Hermon as did Azaru of the first period.
Again, the kings of Tyre and Sidon, harassed by this invader, left
their cities and departed in ships, as they did six hundred years
earlier.
In both periods the art of ivory work flourished, and identical
patterns were produced: designs and execution, characteristic of
the earlier period, were repeated in the second period, and have
been found to be so similar that they have been taken for copies of
the art objects of the first period.
In both periods the same architecture and stone workmanship
(Megiddo, Samaria) found expression.
In both periods the same idiomatic Hebrew was spoken.
Can one accept such a series of coincidences? And if it is
accepted, is it only to have the old difficulties present themselves



again? If the Habiru were the Israelites, why,,then, in the Book of
Joshua, which records the conquest of Canaan, and in the letters of
el-Amarna are no common name and no common event
preserved?
A Halfway Mark
At the beginning of this work I placed before the reader the
unsolved problem of the correlation of Israelite and Egyptian
histories. Of these two ancient nations, one professes to have had
close ties with the other; actually the biblical story moves in the
light and shadow of the great kingdom on the Nile. Egyptian
history, on the other hand, in all its numerous inscriptions, on stone
and on papyrus, denies any real contact with the neighboring
kingdom on the Jordan. Even the glorious age of King Solomon,
so exalted in the Old Testament, appears to have passed entirely
unnoticed by the Egyptian kings and their scribes. And more than
that, the great events of the Israelite past - their long bondage in
Egypt and their departure from that land under unusual
circumstances - appear to have been entirely unknown to the
conventional history of Egypt. For that reason the time of the
Exodus is debated and placed at almost every conceivable time
point of the Egyptian past, from the beginning of the New Kingdom
presumably in - 1580 down many centuries. The uncertainty as to
the time of the sojourn in Egypt and the departure is the direct
result of the absence of references to the children of Israel in Egypt
and to their leaving the country, and of the sterility of information
concerning the relations as neighbors of these two peoples during
the period covered by the Scriptures.
We have attempted to solve the problem of the synchronization
of the histories of these two peoples of antiquity, both of whom
occupy major places in the history of the ancient world. We made
this attempt after we recognized that the biblical story of the
Exodus contains frequently repeated references to some natural



catastrophes. Logic thus required us to look in extant Egyptian
sources for references to some disturbance in nature.
The search proved not to be fruitless. The Leiden Papyrus
Ipuwer is a record of some natural catastrophe followed by a social
upheaval; in the description of the catastrophe we recognized
many details of the disturbances that accompanied the Exodus as
narrated in the Scriptures. The inscription on the shrine from el
Arish contains another version of the cataclysm accompanied by a
herricane and nine days' darkness; and there we found also a
description of the march of the pharaoh and his army toward the
eastern frontier of his kingdom, where he was engulfed in a
whirlpool. The name of the pharaoh is given in a royal cartouche
which proves that the text was not regarded by its writer as
mythical.
If we have in these documents the same story as found in the
Book of Exodus, then a synchronical point between the histories of
these two ancient nations is established. But here, where we
expected to reach the solution of the problem of the date of the
Exodus in Egyptian history, we were confronted with a problem
that made the question of the date of the Exodus shrink into
insignificance. Whatever theories have been offered concerning the
time of the Exodus, not once has the thought occurred that the
Israelites left Egypt on the eve of the arrival of the Hyksos.
Consequently we found ourselves faced with a problem of very
different magnitude. Either Egyptian history is much too long or
biblical history is much too short. Must Egyptian history be
shortened by some "ghost" centuries, or biblical history lengthened
by the same number of "lost" centuries?
We could not know the answer to this problem until we traveled
a long distance through the centuries of ancient history. We noticed
a path on which to start this journey. If the Israelites left Egypt on
the eve of its invasion by the Hyksos, who arrived from Asia, we
might, perchance, find in the Scriptures a reference to a meeting
outside the borders of Egypt of the children of Israel and the
invaders. Actually, even before they reached Mount Sinai, the



Israelites encountered the hordes of Amalekites. We turned to the
old Arabian writers and found that the tradition of the Amalekites
as the dominant tribe among the Arabs, who invaded Egypt and
ruled it for four or five hundred years, is alive in the Arabian
literary heritage from their early past.
As we compared point after point in the Egyptian hieroglyphic,
Hebrew biblical and post-biblical sources, and Arab autochthonous
traditions found in their medieval writings, we were forced to
conclude that the time of the Hyksos domination of Egypt was the
time of the Judges in scriptural history. The equation of Hyksos
and Amalekites gave additional support to the synchronization of
the fall of the Middle Kingdom and the Exodus. We then had to
examine the historical moment of the collapse of Hyksos rule in
Egypt and the end of Amalekite domination in the Near East. In
the siege of Auaris, the Hyksos fortress, by Alimose, some foreign
troops played a decisive role. From parallels in the Book of Samuel
it could be determined that it was King Saul, the first Jewish king,
who was victorious over the Amalekites at el-Arish; and with the
help of many proofs we could establish that el-Arish occupies the
position of the ancient Auaris.
David was a contemporary of Ahmose, founder of the
Eighteenth Dynasty, and of Amenhotep I; Solomon was a
contemporary of Thutinose I and Hatshepsut. And we found that
the celebrated journey to Cod's Land and Punt was the voyage to
Palestine and Phoenicia described in the Scriptures as the visit of
the Queen of Sheba.
We compared many details and always found that they
coincided. But this drove us to the next station on the road. Five
years after Solomon's death the Temple of Jerusalem and its palace
were sacked by a pharaoh. Thutmose III succeeded Hatshepsut. If
we were traveling on the right road, again we had to find a
correspondence here: Thutmose III must have sacked Jerusalem of
the treasures of its palace and Temple. This he actually did, and the
pictures of his booty correspond very closely, in shape and number,



with the description of the loot taken by a pharaoh in the fifth year
after Solomon's death.
Under the next pharaoh Palestine was invaded again, according
to scriptural and Egyptian sources. This time, however, the
expedition was far from being victorious.
For three generations biblical scholars proved to the full
satisfaction of all that many parts of the Scriptures were products of
much later centuries than the Scriptures would indicate. Then,
during the 1930s, with the discovery of the Ras Shamra texts, the
estimate was revised in the diametrically opposite direction: the
same biblical texts were now regarded as a heritage of Canaanite
culture, six centuries older than the biblical texts. However, the
collation of material from Hebrew literary sources, from Ras
Shamra, and from Egypt convinced us that not only the earlier
reduction of the age of biblical prose and verse but also its present
increase is erroneous. In saying this we are actually ahead of what
we may legitimately assert: we still do not know which of the two
histories, Egyptian or Israelite, must be readjusted. At the same
time we Observed how the histories of other ancient countries and
peoples accord with either the Israelite or the Egyptian chronology;
and how the histories of Cyprus, Mycenae, and Crete, in
correlating with one side or the other, create confusion in
archaeology and chronology.
In three consecutive chapters we collated the historical evidence
of three successive generations in Egypt (Hatshepsut, Thutmose III,
Amenhotep II) and in Palestine ( Solomon, Rehoboam, Asa), and
found unfailing correspondence. It is possible that by slicer accident
one age in Egypt bears a close resemblance to another age, and
thus offers ground for a spurious coevality; but it is quite impossible
that three consecutive generations in Egypt and in the neighboring
Palestine of two different ages could produce consistent
correspondence in so many details. What is even more striking,
these three consecutive generations in Egypt as well as in Palestine
were not selected at random, but were forced upon us by the
deliberations and parallels of the earlier chapters, in which we



scrutinized the time of the Exodus and the following centuries until
Saul, and in Egypt the last days of the Middle Kingdom and the
following centuries of Hyksos rule until the rise of the New
Kingdom.
It would be a miracle, indeed, if all these coincidences were
purely accidental. Anyone familiar with the theory of probabilities
knows that with every additional coincidence the chances for an
other grow smaller, not in arithmetical or in geometric progression,
but in a progression of a higher order; therefore the chance would
be a trillion or quadrillion against one that all the parallels offered
on previous pages are merely coincidences.
Following the three consecutive generations in Egypt and
Palestine, there were Amenhotep III and Akhnaton in Egypt and
Jehoshaphat in Judea and Ahab in Israel. It could not be by mere
chance that the fourth generation again presented a picture in
which the details fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The
histories of two lands and the vicissitudes in the lives of their rulers
and their peoples could not be in complete correspondence were
there not exact synchronism. And so it happened that in this fourth
generation the rulers and prominent personages in one country
actually wrote letters to the rulers and prominent personages in the
other country and received written answers from them. To what
extent details and events correspond during those years of famine,
sieges, invasion from Trans-Jordan, and military pressure from the
north has been recounted at length. And this sequence of
invariable correlation and conformity gives us a feeling of security
that we are not on the wrong path.
'However, we are not yet at the end of the journey.
Notwithstanding all that has been said up to now concerning the
numerous parallels, collations, coincidences, and conformities, as
well as the theory of probabilities, we cannot regard the problem of
ancient history as solved until we have covered the full distance to
the point where the histories of the peoples of the ancient East no
longer present a problem of synchronization.



We have before us the eighth and the following centuries,
according to Israelite history. Where, then, shall we find room for
the so-called Nineteenth Dynasty, that of Ramses II and other
famous kings? And what about the Hittite king with whom Ramses
II signed a treaty? And where is there room for the Twentieth and
Twenty-first Dynasties, the Libyan and Ethiopian dominion in
Egypt, and all the others up to and including the Thirtieth Dynasty,
that which expired shortly before Alexander reached Egypt?
The identifications we have made will be of no avail if we are
unable to reach safely this point in history - the end of the last
native dynasty in Egypt. We must be able to disentangle the
archaeological, historical, and chronological problems that we shall
meet in the following centuries and, with the thread of Ariadne we
took from the hands of Ipuwer, to proceed along the path to the
point where the histories of the various nations of antiquity appear
in harmony with one another. If we should not be able to do so the
coincidences presented will necessarily be regarded as miraculous;
for they are too many and too striking to be ascribed to accident. It
is safer to assume, therefore, that by working diligently we shall
arrive at our goal of a complete revision of ancient history.
